[18:49] things um
[18:50] i went to the meetings up there at
[18:52] brother josh's and um
[18:55] was it thursday night getting ready to
[18:57] leave i was sitting in my truck i looked
[18:59] over there
[18:59] across the parking lot and i thought i
[19:01] recognized this young fella
[19:03] and i thought about him often and
[19:07] he come walking over the truck and
[19:10] we started talk we talked for about an
[19:13] hour there in the parking lot but it was
[19:14] brother manuel walker and it really
[19:18] blessed my heart to see him
[19:20] that he has come out of that and that
[19:23] was
[19:24] it just really blessed me to see him
[19:25] there because i often wondered what
[19:27] happened to him
[19:29] the other thing you got that picture
[19:30] brother
[19:34] see this right here remember last time
[19:37] brother tim was here
[19:39] and preached for us and brother stephen
[19:44] at the end of the service in his prayer
[19:48] he prayed to for god to give
[19:51] this brother the desire of his heart and
[19:54] while he was praying that i was sitting
[19:56] back here
[19:57] and it struck me that god's going to
[19:59] give them a child
[20:01] okay and i told him and his wife about
[20:05] it after service that night
[20:07] well i think it was friday night
[20:11] at the service up there i come out he's
[20:14] sitting in the
[20:16] foyer there with this little girl
[20:28] [Laughter]
[20:32] and
[20:39] now they didn't have this little girl
[20:43] but they have a very very good chance of
[20:46] adopting it and it comes out of a family
[20:49] member somewhere
[20:50] along the line and i told him i said
[20:54] brother
[20:54] i said what brother stephen prayed that
[20:57] night and the thought the lord gave me
[21:00] this is a thought expressed
[21:04] you know and it was just wonderful
[21:08] um and this here is on a personal note
[21:13] and i just feel led to speak this
[21:15] because i want to say it publicly
[21:21] and
[21:24] i believe we're in the age of the spoken
[21:26] word
[21:28] that whatever comes out of our mouths
[21:31] the lord is going to manifest it
[21:33] i believe that wholeheartedly
[21:37] if you read the message why christ speak
[21:41] brother branham types it out when moses
[21:43] came to the red sea
[21:45] lord i told you you're going to bring
[21:47] those people back to this mountain
[21:49] and you all are going to worship me here
[21:52] the red sea's in the way what's the
[21:53] problem
[21:55] you know same thing with uh samson
[21:58] and i'm sending this to my daughter
[22:02] okay
[22:06] she's still over there in that babylon
[22:09] her and my son-in-law
[22:11] and savannah i'm sending the spoken word
[22:13] after you
[22:15] it's going to get you out of there and i
[22:17] just want to make this public that is
[22:19] coming for you
[22:21] one way or the other it's going to get
[22:23] you
[22:24] and you're coming out of that mess
[22:27] so i just wanted to put that out there
[22:29] and make it public so
[22:30] the devil knows what's coming
[22:38] amen
[22:40] [Laughter]
[22:43] amen yes ma'am
[22:54] her daughter is getting married and
[22:57] because of
[22:59] life choices as we know um
[23:02] there is a real big issue
[23:20] like he did in your heart this morning
[23:24] i believe her mom will be at the wedding
[23:27] and i wanted to be a testament to the
[23:30] lord
[23:31] so i'm just asking you to pray for that
[23:32] family because it's a lot of people hurt
[23:35] because of that the young people want to
[23:37] do what is right in the sight of god
[23:40] but there's other things that the enemy
[23:42] is trying to
[23:43] prevent i told her it is a union
[23:47] this you're making a union with god
[23:49] regardless of what you've done before
[23:52] that's what he's all about is that union
[23:55] between us and so the enemy doesn't want
[23:59] that to happen
[24:01] so trust the lord seek his face
[24:05] and he will step in so i just want you
[24:08] to pray for that family he knows it all
[24:10] amen as believers
[24:13] we have to stand in the gap for those
[24:16] who are not
[24:28] okay her family right okay um

[46:13] message man
[46:14] yeah we're gonna go back to the old
[46:17] foundation
[46:18] before we start i'm gonna mention
[46:21] something here
[46:22] because i'm on youtube if i was on the
[46:24] house meeting i would have spoken
[46:26] a little bit different but in this
[46:28] church
[46:29] we don't believe in makeup
[46:39] amen we don't believe in makeup in this
[46:42] church
[46:43] amen we do not believe in makeup already
[46:47] preach on it
[46:48] amen we don't believe in women cutting
[46:51] their hair
[46:52] i already preach on them and are
[46:55] demonstrated by the scripture
[46:57] and by the bible and but brother branham
[47:00] say if a woman doesn't have long hair
[47:05] right she can take a wig and put it
[47:08] there
[47:09] amen the only thing we want to see
[47:12] through your hair
[47:13] is to make sure things look so what
[47:17] natural amen if you have
[47:20] dark hair don't put blue air
[47:24] anybody clear if your hair is brown
[47:27] don't bring red hair amen
[47:30] you can put your hair make sure it looks
[47:33] water
[47:34] natural if you want to put a wig on make
[47:36] sure your wig looks water
[47:38] you don't want to have a wig that have
[47:41] the hair that has been trimmed
[47:42] it gives a wrong information amen
[47:46] brother branham say if you don't have
[47:48] nail you can put
[47:49] nail but not that you have nell and you
[47:52] add
[47:52] another nail brother one of them say if
[47:54] you don't have
[47:55] teeth
[47:57] [Music]
[47:58] you cannot put some teeth i gave you the
[48:02] coat
[48:02] it's on youtube anybody clear anybody
[48:05] clear so far
[48:07] amen so when somebody look at your hair
[48:10] and they say it looks beautiful it looks
[48:12] like your hair until
[48:13] men have a confusion to tell whether
[48:16] it's your hair or it's not your hair so
[48:18] you know
[48:18] you perfectly in line with god a man
[48:22] amen so as far as the skin
[48:26] some people have trouble with the skin
[48:30] some women have trouble with their skin
[48:33] anybody clear and brother branham gave
[48:35] us the leverage to work with
[48:38] number one you need to check the motive
[48:41] of your heart
[48:43] anybody clear anybody clear so far
[48:46] and then it is normal to cover
[48:49] the imperfection
[48:52] of your skin keeping
[48:56] in line with your tone
[48:59] anybody here do you hear me
[49:03] in other words you cannot be black
[49:07] and when you cover your imperfection you
[49:10] look
[49:10] white now you are insulting god
[49:16] who made you black everybody you cannot
[49:19] be
[49:19] white and then your covering of the
[49:22] imperfection
[49:23] make you look black
[49:26] that is contrary to the word so if you
[49:29] want to cover
[49:31] that load of that that is right here
[49:33] make sure
[49:34] whatever you use for your covering
[49:37] matches your tone
[49:39] because when you put it a little bit
[49:42] thicker
[49:43] he might give an impression of a makeup
[49:47] but it's not actually a makeup it was
[49:50] just a covering
[49:51] of the imperfection anybody clear
[49:55] i hope you got your answers everybody
[49:58] got the answers
[49:59] anybody got their answer you got a
[50:01] problem some people
[50:03] some sister have a little some i don't
[50:05] want to call it you know what it is
[50:06] on their skin they can use a lot of
[50:09] something
[50:09] make it look natural and
[50:13] line up with your tone so when everybody
[50:16] sees you
[50:16] they know you're already light skinned
[50:18] and they can't tell whether it's you or
[50:19] whether it's somebody else
[50:21] anybody clear so far but we don't want
[50:23] to move from black all the way to white
[50:25] or from white
[50:26] all the way to red then it's a different
[50:28] story anybody clear so far
[50:30] anybody cares so far that's why paul
[50:35] timothy had a problem with his tummy
[50:39] okay you got it now you got it now and
[50:42] timotec keep
[50:43] drinking water water water and the
[50:45] constipation was not helping
[50:48] and we know that as a believer we don't
[50:50] drink wine
[50:52] you know that but paul told timothy
[50:56] he said timothy stop drinking water
[51:00] use a little bit of water for your water
[51:05] not want to test the good wine but
[51:08] one for indigestion
[51:13] everybody clear so far so as a general
[51:16] rule we don't believe in makeup
[51:18] but people have problem with their skin
[51:21] with their tone
[51:22] and as a woman brother branham said
[51:23] there is something about a woman that
[51:25] wants to make herself
[51:26] beautiful anybody clear and i want it to
[51:29] be a training to this church
[51:32] if you see something wrong with somebody
[51:35] don't
[51:36] talk about it
[51:40] anybody care young people if you see
[51:43] something
[51:44] wrong with somebody don't get in the
[51:47] group and begin to talk about it you go
[51:50] straight to that person and you pull
[51:53] that person aside
[51:55] and you talk to her as a brother
[51:58] or as a sister
[52:04] everybody cleared so far and when you
[52:07] talk to them you must keep
[52:09] respect with you because paul
[52:12] told timothy rebuke not an elder
[52:18] clear when you're talking to an elder
[52:20] paul told timothy you talk to him as a
[52:23] father
[52:24] if it's an elder woman you talk to her
[52:27] as
[52:27] a mother if it's a younger sister
[52:31] you talk to her as your sister it's in
[52:34] the scripture
[52:35] everybody clear and if it's a younger
[52:37] brother you talk to them as a younger
[52:40] brother you are not there to scream on
[52:42] people
[52:43] to hush them or to disrespect them
[52:46] everybody you see something wrong and
[52:49] somebody want to talk about
[52:50] it push the button you say sister don't
[52:53] talk to me
[52:54] go see that person everybody clear
[52:58] everybody clear you don't sit and talk
[53:01] and then you finish you say we're going
[53:03] to pray about it
[53:06] what are you going to pray about it you
[53:07] already finished the person left and
[53:09] right
[53:10] there is not even blood in their system
[53:13] you squeeze
[53:14] everything that was there everybody
[53:15] clear so far
[53:17] blessed be the name of the lord so just
[53:19] remember that
[53:20] make it a habit if you don't you're
[53:23] going to grow up in your marriage and
[53:24] you find yourself gossiping
[53:26] all the time i seen this in the message
[53:29] all
[53:30] the time that's why me
[53:33] personally i don't believe in young kids
[53:36] sleeping over
[53:40] because of going from houses to houses
[53:43] to houses and picking up
[53:45] what is wrong with this family what is
[53:47] wrong with this family
[53:48] what is wrong with this family what is
[53:50] wrong with this family and before you
[53:52] have
[53:52] it you know a young sister that know all
[53:55] the families
[53:58] how are you going to be a mother to your
[53:59] church to your children
[54:02] how are you going to do it amen young
[54:05] sister talking about this talking
[54:06] and sometimes you hear the stuff that
[54:08] people are talking it's
[54:10] not even equivalent to their age
[54:14] how did they get that parent
[54:18] when talking about it and when parents
[54:20] were talking about it
[54:21] the sister or the younger brother they
[54:23] caught it and before you know it
[54:25] they know what brother showing so deep
[54:27] they know what sister so and so they
[54:29] they know and when they get to their
[54:30] marriage they don't want to perfect
[54:32] themselves because they already know the
[54:35] weakness of everybody
[54:40] anybody clear so far so remember that
[54:43] i believe that is clear you have a
[54:44] question on that you come back and see
[54:46] me
[54:47] if anything have offended anybody you
[54:49] forgive us
[54:50] because paul told us in romans 15
[54:53] that we make sure that our liberty is
[54:55] not a stumbling block from someone
[54:58] amen sometimes you might do something
[55:00] not with a bad motive
[55:02] but he stumbles somebody else the intent
[55:05] was not to make somebody else stumble
[55:08] but sometimes we gotta watch that
[55:10] liberty and to make sure
[55:11] it doesn't stumble somebody now so we
[55:14] gotta maneuver
[55:15] very good that's why you need wisdom
[55:18] everybody clear so far so praise be the
[55:21] name of the lord the next house meeting
[55:23] will be announced by
[55:25] the deacon and we're going to handle it
[55:27] this coming month this month was so busy
[55:30] and lord's willing i'm going to catch up
[55:32] on the counseling so if you're waiting
[55:33] on me
[55:34] just check on your text message or i'll
[55:36] give you a call and we go ahead and
[55:38] orchestrate
[55:38] everything with the deacon everybody
[55:40] clear so far
[55:42] let's all stand and go to the scripture
[55:49] amen we already talked about respecting
[55:54] the women
[55:55] we don't want to damage that again
[56:00] i hate to see an abused woman
[56:04] she's already a weaker vessel and you
[56:07] take again advantage of her
[56:09] i hate that i can't stand it
[56:13] amen i beat my wife
[56:16] is she your child
[56:20] [Laughter]
[56:25] call me one time when you do that you'll
[56:27] see my reaction
[56:28] and he will teach you not to do that
[56:30] again don't say pastor i'm sorry
[56:37] genesis chapter 2
[56:40] amen we may need to be protected
[56:45] doesn't mean women need to be arrogant
[56:50] because that just drop
[56:54] so if you're battling with that you need
[56:56] to quit
[56:59] genesis chapter 2 verse 9.
[57:07] sometimes people go through different
[57:09] trials and different pressure
[57:11] of life and you might get an answer that
[57:13] you don't want
[57:15] but it's not really the person they just
[57:17] had a bad day at work
[57:21] and they're just responding by what they
[57:23] have
[57:24] but if you know your wife or your
[57:26] husband or your child you can discern
[57:27] this is not them just give them some
[57:29] time to call off and you're going to
[57:31] find out it's not her
[57:32] she just had a bad day she can't take it
[57:34] anymore
[57:36] genesis chapter 2 verse 9 and out of the
[57:39] ground
[57:40] may the lord god to grow every tree
[57:44] that is pleasant to the sight you might
[57:46] be seated
[57:47] and good for food everybody clear
[57:51] we already explained to you that in the
[57:53] garden of eden
[57:55] every single tree that was inside the
[57:57] garden of eden
[57:58] all trees were what good for food
[58:03] everybody clear and pleasant to the eye
[58:06] we already demonstrated to you that
[58:09] anybody clear
[58:11] now the bravo is going to give three
[58:13] categories here
[58:16] karma and good for food the tree of
[58:20] life also in the midst of the garden
[58:24] and the tree of knowledge of good and
[58:27] evil right here we have three categories
[58:31] of
[58:32] of trees we had the remaining
[58:36] trees of the garden amen
[58:39] whether he was apple apricot whatever he
[58:41] was
[58:42] those three were eatable or they were
[58:45] commenstable
[58:46] anybody care and then we have
[58:50] the tree of life
[58:53] everybody clear and then we have the
[58:56] tree
[58:56] of the knowledge of good and evil
[58:59] everybody clear
[59:00] so we have three categories here we have
[59:03] the tree of the knowledge of good and
[59:05] evil
[59:06] we have the tree of life and every other
[59:09] three
[59:10] every other tree was compounded into
[59:14] that set that remained anybody clear
[59:18] these three categories have
[59:21] three lives yes
[59:24] are we okay every single tree in the
[59:28] garden of eden
[59:30] could be eaten everybody care
[59:33] but god separated two trees
[59:36] from the remaining of the tree everybody
[59:39] clear
[59:40] the tree of life and the tree of the
[59:42] knowledge of good and evil
[59:44] every single tree apart from these
[59:48] two trees could give man
[59:51] natural life
[59:54] in other words men can live with this
[59:57] tree
[59:58] and sustain their life this is what the
[1:00:01] new
[1:00:02] testament called bread anybody clear so
[1:00:06] far
[1:00:07] the tree of life gave also people
[1:00:10] life and that life was eternal life
[1:00:16] everybody and the tree of the knowledge
[1:00:20] of good and evil
[1:00:22] gave people life also but that life
[1:00:26] was called death and brother branham
[1:00:29] said
[1:00:29] death is life water perverted
[1:00:33] everybody so you have three categories
[1:00:37] of life here you have the natural life
[1:00:40] that comes by the bread
[1:00:42] you have the eternal life everybody
[1:00:45] clear
[1:00:45] that come from the bread that's why
[1:00:47] jesus said
[1:00:48] i am the bread of life that came down
[1:00:51] from heaven
[1:00:52] everybody care so these two here men
[1:00:56] are not lived by water by bread alone
[1:00:59] but by every water
[1:01:01] these are the two that god wants you to
[1:01:04] stay here
[1:01:06] make sense this you can eat it
[1:01:10] but it's gonna cause death god do not
[1:01:13] want you to eat this one
[1:01:17] we created so far hallelujah
[1:01:20] job to verse 16 and the lord god command
[1:01:25] commanded the man saying of every tree
[1:01:29] of the garden of eden of the garden i'm
[1:01:32] sorry
[1:01:33] you may freely eat what god was telling
[1:01:36] them
[1:01:37] every tree except this one
[1:01:40] men shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:01:44] every word you can do this for your
[1:01:46] natural life
[1:01:48] this one is for your spiritual life
[1:01:50] anybody clear so far
[1:01:52] he continued he said but of the tree of
[1:01:55] the knowledge of good and evil
[1:01:57] you shall not eat of it and
[1:02:01] in the day that you eat thereof you
[1:02:03] shall surely water
[1:02:05] there is another life there that is
[1:02:07] called death
[1:02:08] but death is a perverted life everybody
[1:02:11] clears so far
[1:02:12] jump to verse 25 and they were both
[1:02:16] water
[1:02:17] they were naked the men and the woman
[1:02:20] and were not
[1:02:21] water so we found out that man
[1:02:24] in the garden of eden here man was
[1:02:28] naked and
[1:02:31] with the nakedness goes
[1:02:34] the shame everybody clear
[1:02:38] nakedness is always coupled
[1:02:42] by shame everybody clear
[1:02:46] we're getting somewhere in isaiah 47
[1:02:50] verse 3
[1:02:52] the bible says that nakedness
[1:02:55] shall be watered uncovered
[1:02:58] ye the water that shame shall be seen
[1:03:02] so nakedness is always connected by
[1:03:06] shame but the problem is
[1:03:09] god veiled this mystery
[1:03:12] oh god veil this concept
[1:03:17] anybody clear that adam
[1:03:20] and eve could look at one another
[1:03:23] but the very concept the very
[1:03:27] mystery of nakedness and shame was
[1:03:30] removed
[1:03:35] if we don't get this you won't
[1:03:36] understand why you need to dress
[1:03:38] correctly
[1:03:39] anybody clear and i would take vengeance
[1:03:42] and i will not meet thee as a man in the
[1:03:45] book of naom
[1:03:46] chapter 3 verse 5 the bible says behold
[1:03:50] i am against this say the lord of hosts
[1:03:53] and i will discover thy water
[1:03:55] that skirt upon the face like marilyn
[1:03:58] monroe
[1:03:59] you know that picture where she took
[1:04:02] going up
[1:04:03] everybody clear and i will show the
[1:04:05] nation thy
[1:04:06] nakedness and the kingdom thy water
[1:04:10] so the nakedness and shame work together
[1:04:14] that's why the bible says they were
[1:04:16] naked but they were not
[1:04:17] what a shame if you have close
[1:04:21] one of them he automatically will
[1:04:24] trigger the second one
[1:04:27] anybody clear in jeremiah chapter 3
[1:04:30] verse 3
[1:04:31] the bible says therefore the shower have
[1:04:34] been withholded
[1:04:36] and there has been known there has been
[1:04:39] no light
[1:04:40] rain and that has a water a
[1:04:43] whole forehead in other words a
[1:04:45] prostituted face
[1:04:47] that refuses to be water so when
[1:04:51] somebody reached the stage of
[1:04:54] prostitution
[1:04:59] the shame is removed
[1:05:03] everybody here so a prostitute
[1:05:06] have a veil removed
[1:05:11] everybody clear but when the veil is
[1:05:14] removed automatically you must be
[1:05:18] ashamed of something but the prostitute
[1:05:21] is
[1:05:22] not a shame the bible says in other
[1:05:25] words there is another
[1:05:26] veil that is given to the prostitute
[1:05:30] that make her not a shame even does she
[1:05:34] look
[1:05:34] naked
[1:05:38] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:05:41] lord
[1:05:42] jump to genesis chapter 3 verse 1
[1:05:45] verse 3 if you're there you can say amen
[1:05:49] but
[1:05:50] of the fruit of the tree which is
[1:05:54] in the water in the midst of the garden
[1:05:58] you need to understand the language of
[1:06:00] the bible
[1:06:01] what is a gardener song of solomon
[1:06:04] chapter 5 verse 1
[1:06:06] i am come into my water my god and my
[1:06:09] water
[1:06:10] and my water now you understand what the
[1:06:13] gardens means
[1:06:14] we clear now in first corinthians
[1:06:17] chapter 3 verse 9
[1:06:18] for we are laborers together with god
[1:06:23] ye the people are god's husbandry in
[1:06:26] other words you are god's garden
[1:06:29] you are god's water so a garden spoke
[1:06:33] about a woman
[1:06:38] let me go slowly in the midst
[1:06:42] she about the fruit of the tree
[1:06:45] which is in the midst so there is a
[1:06:47] garden but in the midst
[1:06:49] of the garden you understand now
[1:06:54] in the midst of the garden
[1:06:57] god has said you shall not do what
[1:07:02] eat of it neither shall you water
[1:07:05] when god spoke this in genesis 2 7
[1:07:09] 16 god only used the word
[1:07:12] it god never used the word touching
[1:07:17] when eve begin to give to the serpent
[1:07:21] amen rehearse the commandment of god
[1:07:24] eve added the word touch
[1:07:28] if was not contradicting god
[1:07:33] eve was saying the same thing god
[1:07:36] was speaking in proverbs chapter 30
[1:07:39] verse 20
[1:07:40] such is the way of an adulterous woman
[1:07:44] she does water
[1:07:48] anybody clear you see that eating what
[1:07:51] it means
[1:07:52] she eat it and wipe off her mouth
[1:07:56] and say i have done no water
[1:07:59] so the eating right here means something
[1:08:02] else
[1:08:03] that's what an adulterous woman does
[1:08:06] because he's committed adultery
[1:08:12] that is your word eating what about the
[1:08:14] word
[1:08:15] touch first corinthians chapter seven
[1:08:18] verse one
[1:08:19] now concerning the things whereof you
[1:08:22] wrote unto me
[1:08:23] it is good for a man not to do whatever
[1:08:27] anybody clear that's why eve said you
[1:08:30] cannot
[1:08:31] eat of it or need water paul confirmed
[1:08:35] what eve
[1:08:35] said and solomon confirmed what eve said
[1:08:39] they both speaking about the same thing
[1:08:42] nevertheless to avoid
[1:08:44] fornication so fornication means what
[1:08:48] you touching a woman you understand now
[1:08:52] to avoid fornication let every man have
[1:08:56] his
[1:08:56] own wife and let every woman have her
[1:08:59] own water
[1:09:00] that's where the touching is permitted
[1:09:04] that's where the eating is permitted
[1:09:07] fornication
[1:09:08] is sexual relationship before marriage
[1:09:11] adultery is sexual relationship outside
[1:09:15] of marriage when you are already married
[1:09:17] ever here one here eating and the other
[1:09:20] one is water
[1:09:22] in other words god from the garden of
[1:09:24] eden
[1:09:25] was against adultery
[1:09:30] the word eating and eve added
[1:09:33] for fornication
[1:09:37] [Music]
[1:09:38] god was against adultery and was against
[1:09:42] water
[1:09:46] anybody clear okay let's go back now
[1:09:50] you shall not eat of it neither shall
[1:09:53] you touch it
[1:09:54] lest you do water let you die and the
[1:09:57] serpent said to the woman we already
[1:09:59] explained you this
[1:10:01] you shall not surely die
[1:10:04] hallelujah for god does know
[1:10:07] everybody clear so far god does
[1:10:11] know that in the day you
[1:10:14] eat thereof then your eyes shall be
[1:10:18] open and you shall be as gods
[1:10:21] why do you want to be god amen
[1:10:25] knowing good and evil because you ate of
[1:10:27] that tree
[1:10:28] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[1:10:31] good for food
[1:10:32] and that he was pleasant to the eyes and
[1:10:35] a tree to be desired to make
[1:10:37] one wise another wisdom
[1:10:41] she took off the fruit thereof and did
[1:10:43] eat
[1:10:44] and gave also to her husband with her
[1:10:47] and he did
[1:10:48] it everybody clear verse 7 now
[1:10:51] and the eyes of both of them just like
[1:10:54] lucifer told them
[1:10:56] where water were open and they
[1:10:59] knew at the beginning they didn't know
[1:11:03] their conscience was protected
[1:11:06] now they knew that they were naked
[1:11:11] and they saw fig leaves together
[1:11:14] and made themselves water
[1:11:18] the first time that this concept
[1:11:22] of nakedness was opened
[1:11:25] he produced shame between adam and eve
[1:11:31] and shame led to the first manufacture
[1:11:35] of clothing
[1:11:40] everybody clear the first manufacture
[1:11:44] of clothing by human being
[1:11:48] was introduced when the concept
[1:11:51] of nakedness and shame
[1:11:54] was introduced to the human
[1:11:59] species the animal didn't need clothing
[1:12:03] your dog till today downey clothes
[1:12:07] the elephant doesn't need clothes the
[1:12:09] monkey doesn't need clothes
[1:12:11] the only one that needs clothes is a man
[1:12:14] but god veiled the man everybody clear
[1:12:19] with a different veil everybody clear
[1:12:23] but brother branham said an immoral
[1:12:25] woman
[1:12:26] attack a man with three things number
[1:12:30] one
[1:12:30] he attacked a man with beauty which is
[1:12:33] speaking about the first
[1:12:35] number two he attacked the woman the man
[1:12:37] with water
[1:12:39] with sex control and number three he
[1:12:41] attacked the man with water
[1:12:43] with her form all her shape everybody
[1:12:47] clear
[1:12:47] god veiled the formal
[1:12:52] and god veiled the sex
[1:12:55] and god only left the beauty
[1:13:02] outside so when adam
[1:13:05] looked at eve adam saw that eve was
[1:13:09] beautiful because if was god's perfect
[1:13:12] thought of a beauty to the woman that's
[1:13:15] why when you
[1:13:16] follow the scripture you will see the
[1:13:18] scripture always say
[1:13:20] esther was fair to look on
[1:13:24] you understand a big air was fair to
[1:13:27] look on
[1:13:28] mirka was fair to look on oh they have
[1:13:32] a beautiful countenance the bible always
[1:13:35] speak about the beauty
[1:13:37] of the face but the bible doesn't give
[1:13:40] the description of these two
[1:13:43] so what was actually veiled by the holy
[1:13:46] veil
[1:13:47] was these two aspects right
[1:13:51] everybody so far when these two were
[1:13:54] opened up to men it produced shame
[1:13:59] and the production of shem introduced
[1:14:02] the meeting
[1:14:03] for clothing
[1:14:07] you don't put clothing on your face
[1:14:16] you cover the remainder of the body
[1:14:21] ever here these things were exposed
[1:14:24] before
[1:14:25] but adam was not even attracted to that
[1:14:30] ever clear the sex was exposed before
[1:14:34] neither adam or if nobody was caring
[1:14:37] about it
[1:14:38] ever here but when this concept was
[1:14:41] broken
[1:14:42] but here then the remaining of the body
[1:14:46] must be covered
[1:14:53] you see why you need to cover your body
[1:14:56] now you understand amen
[1:15:00] let's go to verse 8. and they heard the
[1:15:04] voice of the lord
[1:15:06] walking how can a voice walk
[1:15:11] how can a voice walk that was god
[1:15:14] himself
[1:15:15] him and his voice are one they heard the
[1:15:18] voice of the lord walking
[1:15:20] in the garden of of eden or in the
[1:15:23] garden in the cool of the day
[1:15:25] and adam and his wife hid themselves
[1:15:28] from the presence of who adam
[1:15:32] already have clothing made
[1:15:35] eve has clothing made so when god
[1:15:39] came adam and eve could present
[1:15:42] before god with the clothing they
[1:15:45] manufacture
[1:15:46] themselves by the wisdom of the devil
[1:15:50] but when the presence of god was coming
[1:15:53] in the cool of the day their clothing
[1:15:58] was still speaking of nakedness
[1:16:04] they had clothing but those clothing
[1:16:08] were still giving message of nakedness
[1:16:14] a proper cloth cannot
[1:16:17] give a message of nakedness
[1:16:21] [Music]
[1:16:25] hallelujah the he demon
[1:16:29] the trees of the garden first man and
[1:16:32] the lord god
[1:16:33] called to adam and said to him where are
[1:16:36] you
[1:16:37] and he said i heard
[1:16:40] your voice in the garden and i was water
[1:16:45] perfect love is removed because perfect
[1:16:48] love casts out what
[1:16:50] everybody so far they were living under
[1:16:53] perfect love
[1:16:54] under perfect love you don't look at
[1:16:56] that anymore
[1:16:57] that's what happened in the sixth
[1:17:00] dimension
[1:17:02] that's why in the sixth dimension
[1:17:04] brother branham was hugging sisters
[1:17:07] and brother branham could not feel
[1:17:08] anything
[1:17:13] this message is perfectly in line
[1:17:16] with the scripture i was
[1:17:19] afraid because i was water
[1:17:22] so even though adam has clothing
[1:17:26] but in the presence of god adam realized
[1:17:30] that he was still naked
[1:17:34] everybody that's why brother branham
[1:17:37] said when he went to the
[1:17:39] jungle of africa he found
[1:17:42] some of the african tribes that were
[1:17:45] going there
[1:17:46] without anything on there except
[1:17:49] the protection of the sex because of the
[1:17:52] serpent seed
[1:17:54] but when the holy spirit dropped down
[1:17:57] everybody clear what used to be normal
[1:18:00] for those tribes
[1:18:02] brother branham said the women begin to
[1:18:05] cover their chest
[1:18:06] and they all run for clothing
[1:18:14] about here because the holy ghost
[1:18:17] removed that last veil
[1:18:18] completely off amen then they realize
[1:18:22] like they need clothing this is not
[1:18:25] supposed to be exposed
[1:18:27] this is supposed to be hidden
[1:18:32] are you following me
[1:18:36] but the devil doesn't stop there anybody
[1:18:39] care
[1:18:40] the proper clothing cannot
[1:18:44] show your form
[1:18:58] let's keep on going where i was at
[1:19:02] i was naked yet he was close
[1:19:05] and i hid myself how do you hide
[1:19:07] yourself with clothing
[1:19:09] and he said who told you that you were
[1:19:13] naked
[1:19:14] so somebody told him that he was naked
[1:19:17] have you eaten off the trees whereof i
[1:19:20] commanded you that you should not eat
[1:19:24] now adam who told you you were naked so
[1:19:27] adam was there still blind
[1:19:29] so somebody came and taught adam
[1:19:33] what nakedness is and the teaching
[1:19:37] was removing the veil
[1:19:42] verse 12 and the men say the who
[1:19:46] so the woman becomes
[1:19:50] the teacher
[1:19:55] the woman whom you gave me to be with me
[1:19:59] she gave me of the tree
[1:20:02] and i did what so woman
[1:20:06] who taught you this stuff verse 13
[1:20:10] and the lord god say to the woman
[1:20:13] what is this that you have done and the
[1:20:15] woman said
[1:20:16] who the serpent begot me and i did water
[1:20:21] so the teaching of nakedness the concept
[1:20:25] of nakedness was introduced by the
[1:20:27] serpent to eve
[1:20:29] and eve took that concept to adam
[1:20:33] that's why god said you listen to the
[1:20:35] voice of eve
[1:20:37] it was a teaching job to verse 21.
[1:20:42] to adam also and to his wife
[1:20:46] did the lord god made water
[1:20:49] so god finally saw that the manufacturer
[1:20:53] of men was not well equipped
[1:20:57] to cover what he covered himself before
[1:21:02] anybody clear god took cuts of skin we
[1:21:05] know islam
[1:21:07] and deed water god was the one that
[1:21:11] clothed them
[1:21:12] in other words god conceal
[1:21:17] everybody clear the nakedness
[1:21:21] everybody care but the devil
[1:21:24] wants you to reveal
[1:21:30] ever here dead nakedness
[1:21:34] ever clear and the devil does that in
[1:21:37] two ways
[1:21:38] either he will make you take off your
[1:21:41] clothes
[1:21:42] everybody and bring you back to the leaf
[1:21:46] to the fig leaves ever clear
[1:21:49] by shortening your clothing or if
[1:21:53] you too smart the devil will
[1:21:56] make you keep your clothes but
[1:21:59] make your clothes unveil your nakedness
[1:22:03] through in other words even though you
[1:22:07] were
[1:22:07] close we can see your shape
[1:22:10] completely even your curves
[1:22:19] let's go to revelation 2 and then we're
[1:22:22] going to pray
[1:22:25] that's why you hear brother branham
[1:22:26] talking about form feeding
[1:22:30] because that form was supposed to be
[1:22:34] covered that's why when david
[1:22:37] looked at this the bible said she was of
[1:22:40] a beautiful
[1:22:41] continent their eyes were in the face in
[1:22:44] the face
[1:22:45] in the face the only one who had an
[1:22:48] attire different was a prostitute in
[1:22:50] proverbs 7.
[1:22:53] then her attraction is now different
[1:22:55] revelation 2
[1:22:56] verse 20. if you dare you can say amen
[1:23:00] notwithstanding i have a few things
[1:23:03] against you
[1:23:04] because you permit that woman kahu
[1:23:08] jezebel which call herself a prophetess
[1:23:11] she's a teacher
[1:23:13] she's a preacher she has a voice
[1:23:17] to do whatever to teach
[1:23:20] who gave jezebel her gospel
[1:23:25] you see now to teach and to set use
[1:23:30] so number one there is a teaching and
[1:23:33] after you
[1:23:34] swallow the teaching then they're gonna
[1:23:36] seduce you that's what happened to eve
[1:23:40] first there was a gospel that was opened
[1:23:42] up to eve
[1:23:44] when the gospel was opened up then evils
[1:23:47] beguiled into the act
[1:23:50] he started with a teaching to teach
[1:23:54] and to seduce my servant to commit water
[1:23:58] so you need to be taught fornication
[1:24:01] anybody clear
[1:24:03] and to do what you see those words
[1:24:07] you see that word eating and to eat
[1:24:10] think
[1:24:10] sacrifice to water everybody clear so
[1:24:13] far
[1:24:14] let's pray now heavenly father
[1:24:19] lord we thank you again for your grace
[1:24:21] your love your mercy father
[1:24:23] and for everything you have been doing
[1:24:25] for us
[1:24:26] father we have done what any man on
[1:24:28] planet earth that you give any sensible
[1:24:31] intelligence can do is to take the word
[1:24:34] and he can read it
[1:24:36] if they have been in school alone father
[1:24:38] about school doesn't interpret your word
[1:24:41] it takes the holy spirit to bring your
[1:24:43] word to life lord
[1:24:45] father may you move me completely out of
[1:24:47] the way
[1:24:48] may you come and speak to your children
[1:24:51] and bless us today
[1:24:52] lord we rebuke every demonic spirit away
[1:24:56] from us lord
[1:24:57] may you conceal us under the angels of
[1:25:00] heaven lord
[1:25:00] and may father something be spoken this
[1:25:03] morning
[1:25:04] that will bring us closer unto thee we
[1:25:06] humbly ask it in the name of jesus
[1:25:09] christ
[1:25:10] amen god bless you we're on part
[1:25:13] 42. i want you to keep this scripture in
[1:25:15] mind
[1:25:17] you have heard that he was saved by them
[1:25:19] of all time
[1:25:21] that shall not commit adultery
[1:25:24] in the law of moses you must go commit
[1:25:27] adultery
[1:25:28] you must do it in the physical then when
[1:25:32] they catch you in the physical
[1:25:33] then they take you and stone you they
[1:25:36] must catch you like the woman that was
[1:25:37] caught in adultery
[1:25:39] they must catch you in adultery
[1:25:41] everybody clear
[1:25:43] but but i say unto you that whatsoever
[1:25:47] locusts on a woman no more
[1:25:51] the act first but the sight
[1:25:54] the one who look on a woman to last
[1:25:58] after her hey but here adam
[1:26:02] look at eve adam never lasted
[1:26:05] on eve anybody
[1:26:12] abraham neverlasted hagar a
[1:26:15] teaching have to be given to adam
[1:26:18] first to cause adam to last
[1:26:23] on if ever care a teaching have to be
[1:26:26] handed to abraham first
[1:26:28] to cause abraham to last on edgar
[1:26:32] and that whatsoever look on a woman
[1:26:36] to last after her has committed adultery
[1:26:40] with her with her already in the water
[1:26:43] so right here adultery doesn't start
[1:26:46] in the physical yet adultery started
[1:26:51] in the heart by the lust
[1:26:54] but what make a man last on a woman
[1:26:59] amen how can you look at a woman and
[1:27:01] last on her
[1:27:02] amen the scripture said when david saw
[1:27:05] she was beautiful to look on
[1:27:07] that is not lasting and but here
[1:27:11] when rebecca was coming back home she
[1:27:14] saw
[1:27:14] isaac from afar off and she asked
[1:27:18] who is that they said that my master and
[1:27:21] she closed the veil brother brother said
[1:27:22] he was
[1:27:23] love at first sight he was not
[1:27:26] lost but lost
[1:27:31] walk us as a woman that a man will look
[1:27:34] at her
[1:27:35] and says that he lost him we already
[1:27:38] spoke
[1:27:38] about the weakness of the body of a
[1:27:41] woman
[1:27:42] we explained to you that that weakness
[1:27:44] was in the flesh everybody clear so far
[1:27:47] now we're gonna touch the element beauty
[1:27:50] today
[1:27:51] that's where we stop in first
[1:27:53] corinthians chapter 15 verse 45
[1:27:56] the bible say and so it is written
[1:28:00] the first adam was made a living soul
[1:28:05] everybody here the last adam
[1:28:09] was made a quickening spirit
[1:28:12] so right here we have two of them
[1:28:16] we have the first adam and the last
[1:28:20] adam or the second atom so when they say
[1:28:24] last
[1:28:25] we cannot have a third atom
[1:28:28] it's going to be contrary to the
[1:28:30] scripture
[1:28:32] everybody clear now isaiah 53 verse 2
[1:28:36] the bible says that for he shall grow up
[1:28:39] before him
[1:28:40] as a tender plant speaking about christ
[1:28:43] and as a root
[1:28:45] out of the dry ground he has no form
[1:28:49] nor crumbliness this is jesus christ
[1:28:52] the last adam and when we shall see him
[1:28:56] there is no water there is no beauty
[1:29:00] that we should desire him
[1:29:03] that's why brother branham said adam was
[1:29:06] not
[1:29:06] beautiful because the last
[1:29:10] adam was a reproduction of the first
[1:29:13] adam
[1:29:14] and the last adam when he came he was
[1:29:18] not
[1:29:18] beautiful the beauty was taken off of
[1:29:22] him
[1:29:22] because when god created the animal
[1:29:25] in the garden of eden the man was the
[1:29:28] one that was beautiful
[1:29:30] but when god created the human being
[1:29:34] god took the beauty of adam
[1:29:37] and putting it on the woman that's why
[1:29:41] adam was attracted by the beauty
[1:29:44] of eve it was a beauty that belonged to
[1:29:50] him
[1:29:52] hallelujah in marriage and divorce
[1:29:56] brother branham say sin is pretty
[1:30:00] the picture of judas as some old
[1:30:03] drunkard
[1:30:04] sought out here on the street somewhere
[1:30:06] a mouth
[1:30:07] hanging with flies in it and so forth as
[1:30:10] judah
[1:30:11] judah was water handsome
[1:30:14] strong a deceiver
[1:30:17] he and that guy to watch around you
[1:30:22] he and that guy a guy that the old
[1:30:25] farmer
[1:30:26] come in with a pair of overalls on to
[1:30:29] watch around your wife
[1:30:31] it is that slicker he is the water
[1:30:35] the rust cow so a normal man
[1:30:39] is not too beautiful
[1:30:44] about here death in the had a son
[1:30:48] by the name of absalom and absalom was
[1:30:51] beautiful
[1:30:52] from the head the tail of his head all
[1:30:56] the way to his soul
[1:30:57] and he was the one that caused more
[1:31:00] deception
[1:31:01] in israel because he reflected lucifer
[1:31:08] hallelujah ezekiel 28
[1:31:11] verse 12 son of man take up a
[1:31:14] lamentation upon the king of paris
[1:31:18] amen and say unto him we spoke about
[1:31:21] this
[1:31:22] that says the lord god that seals
[1:31:26] up the sun he's the top
[1:31:30] full of wisdom anybody clear and perfect
[1:31:34] in water
[1:31:36] so when god created the angel
[1:31:39] the top of every angel
[1:31:43] was lucifer yes yes sir
[1:31:47] you following me everybody clear
[1:31:51] and lucifer was the one that
[1:31:54] sealed up the sun he was the top full of
[1:31:58] what
[1:31:59] wisdom and what beauty
[1:32:02] this lucifer has wisdom
[1:32:05] and also beauty
[1:32:09] now according to genesis chapter 3
[1:32:12] verse 1 the most saddle
[1:32:19] you understand the top of every beast
[1:32:23] on earth was the serpent
[1:32:28] are you following me god was the god of
[1:32:32] heaven
[1:32:33] after god the pup was lucifer
[1:32:37] and he was beautiful you follow me
[1:32:41] adam was the god of the earth
[1:32:45] after adam the top the most
[1:32:49] saddle then every creature was the
[1:32:52] serpent
[1:32:55] anybody clear so in heaven
[1:32:59] we have lucifer on the earth
[1:33:02] we have the serpent
[1:33:08] the head of lucifer is crushed
[1:33:11] and the head of the serpent was adam
[1:33:15] that's why the serpent never attacked
[1:33:20] adam do you follow me
[1:33:24] but in heaven lucifer was what
[1:33:27] beautiful if lucifer was beautiful
[1:33:31] how was the serpent
[1:33:36] clear now hallelujah verse 13
[1:33:40] that has been in water
[1:33:44] the garden of water so who was in eden
[1:33:53] that has been in eden the garden of god
[1:33:57] every precious stone was the covering
[1:34:01] the sergius the topaz and the diamond
[1:34:04] and the burial dionyx the jasper the
[1:34:07] sapphire
[1:34:08] the emerald and the carbuncle and gold
[1:34:10] the workmanship of that trap
[1:34:12] of that tavern and of that pipe was
[1:34:15] preparing the
[1:34:16] in the day that you were created that
[1:34:19] the anointed character
[1:34:23] that covereth and i have said
[1:34:26] this so that was upon the holy
[1:34:29] mountain of god so in the very
[1:34:33] sanctuary of god lucifer was present
[1:34:37] as the top of everybody in the very
[1:34:41] sanctuary of god on earth the president
[1:34:45] was adam but the prime minister was the
[1:34:48] serpent
[1:34:51] anybody here that has walked up and down
[1:34:55] in the midst of the stones of fire that
[1:34:58] was
[1:34:59] perfect in their ways from the day
[1:35:03] that that was created until iniquity was
[1:35:07] found in water
[1:35:08] there was something in lucifer
[1:35:12] that matches the serpent
[1:35:19] revelation 12 verse 9
[1:35:22] and the great dragon was cast out
[1:35:26] now what
[1:35:30] i'm reading the scripture the great
[1:35:34] dragon
[1:35:35] the bible is calling him the old water
[1:35:38] the bible
[1:35:39] didn't say the serpent because the
[1:35:42] serpent
[1:35:44] is a snake today
[1:35:47] makes sense yes everybody clear the
[1:35:49] bible said that
[1:35:51] old serpent to remind you that
[1:35:54] remember that beast that was in the
[1:35:57] garden
[1:35:58] not the virgin that was cursed but the
[1:36:02] original one
[1:36:05] that old serpent camera called the water
[1:36:09] the devil and water which deceived the
[1:36:13] whole water
[1:36:14] so when the devil came the devil
[1:36:18] already have a body that he can
[1:36:22] incarnate
[1:36:24] and the future of that body matches
[1:36:28] his future in heaven
[1:36:32] first person in heaven after outside of
[1:36:34] god
[1:36:35] the top on earth outside of adam
[1:36:38] beautiful
[1:36:39] beautiful so when the devil came the
[1:36:42] devil
[1:36:43] incarnated the serpent
[1:36:46] and the serpent when he received the
[1:36:49] fullness
[1:36:50] of the devil the serpent now was called
[1:36:54] the devil
[1:36:59] everybody clear he was called the devil
[1:37:03] and satan it was not that the serpent
[1:37:07] was satan
[1:37:08] the serpent was a creature a beast
[1:37:12] but when the serpent went the devil
[1:37:16] incarnated poured himself
[1:37:19] into the serpent the serpent
[1:37:22] and the devil become one
[1:37:25] everybody there was also another body
[1:37:29] that came on earth that was called
[1:37:32] emmanuella
[1:37:34] and one day god also poured himself
[1:37:38] into the body when god poured himself
[1:37:42] by ketosis and a morphe
[1:37:45] into the body that body and god
[1:37:49] became one that's why jesus
[1:37:52] is god
[1:37:52] [Applause]
[1:38:00] everybody the devil inconnected the
[1:38:04] beast
[1:38:05] but god he connected man
[1:38:09] [Applause]
[1:38:12] everybody clear so far brother branham
[1:38:15] trying to do god's service without being
[1:38:18] in god's will
[1:38:19] i would not preach it in brother jack's
[1:38:22] church he told me go ahead and do it
[1:38:26] but i'm going to the tabernacle to the
[1:38:29] tabernacle
[1:38:30] and they'll be about four hours long
[1:38:35] what a sermon barbara and my subject
[1:38:38] is the water
[1:38:41] the beast at the beginning and the beast
[1:38:44] at the beginning is who
[1:38:46] the devil in the serpent
[1:38:51] the beast at the beginning and the
[1:38:54] beast at the end are you following me
[1:38:59] brother branham never preached that
[1:39:01] sermon
[1:39:02] yet he preached it
[1:39:06] he never preached it as a title of the
[1:39:09] sermon
[1:39:09] but he preached
[1:39:13] hallelujah you ready they beast
[1:39:16] at the beginning and they beast at the
[1:39:18] end
[1:39:19] at the beginning the garden was the
[1:39:23] garden
[1:39:24] of eden but when brother branham came
[1:39:28] brother branham preached satan's eden
[1:39:33] so there is a needham at the beginning
[1:39:36] [Music]
[1:39:38] which belong to god and there is also a
[1:39:41] medium
[1:39:42] at the end which belonged to satan
[1:39:46] at the beginning people were naked
[1:39:50] and did not know at the end la
[1:39:53] audition you are water and you also
[1:39:57] don't know
[1:40:02] everybody clear so far blessed be the
[1:40:05] name of the lord
[1:40:06] the beast at the beginning and the beast
[1:40:10] at the end
[1:40:11] through the water the trail
[1:40:14] of the serpent takes about four hours
[1:40:18] i got my scripture all laying out
[1:40:22] the beast from the beginning he was the
[1:40:26] beast at the garden of water
[1:40:28] you see everyone i'm being preached
[1:40:31] everybody here
[1:40:33] he is the beast at the water
[1:40:36] at the end and show that he is
[1:40:40] a water so brother branham said
[1:40:45] the beast at the beginning was an animal
[1:40:48] called the serpent
[1:40:50] that received the fullness of the devil
[1:40:54] badly ever here and at the end
[1:40:59] under satan edema there won't be
[1:41:02] another beast this time it's not an
[1:41:05] animal
[1:41:06] but it's a person receiving
[1:41:10] the fullness of satan bodily
[1:41:18] and show that he is a water a religious
[1:41:22] person
[1:41:22] and a denomination that made the
[1:41:25] denomination
[1:41:26] and come right through the trail of him
[1:41:29] and prove it to you
[1:41:30] by the scripture that it is i didn't
[1:41:33] know that
[1:41:34] till the holy spirit gave it to me the
[1:41:36] other day
[1:41:37] up there brother stephen let's keep
[1:41:40] going on that one
[1:41:42] when when pagan rome became
[1:41:46] what pepperon he never
[1:41:49] sees because there was a beast
[1:41:53] that was wounded to death and that beast
[1:41:56] was the roman empire
[1:41:58] but that beast escaped the world
[1:42:01] from roman as a nation to roman as a
[1:42:06] religion
[1:42:07] from roman pagan the nation of rome
[1:42:11] that is called today italy to a
[1:42:14] religious sect
[1:42:17] anybody clear the system
[1:42:21] of romanism ceased when a new king come
[1:42:25] in
[1:42:26] he just sat up a new order but when they
[1:42:29] come
[1:42:29] into pagan rome through the catholic
[1:42:33] church
[1:42:34] through populism he never sees
[1:42:38] if one pup dies they set up
[1:42:42] another one one pop dies
[1:42:45] they set up another one the beast
[1:42:48] which was which is not yet
[1:42:52] is which is not which is the
[1:42:55] which is and shall go into what
[1:42:58] that serves the holy spirit through the
[1:43:01] water
[1:43:01] through the scripture but branham says
[1:43:04] here
[1:43:05] that in the book of revelation the bible
[1:43:08] says that
[1:43:09] there is a beast that come up from
[1:43:11] perdition
[1:43:12] and goes up and down and another one
[1:43:14] comes up and goes up and down
[1:43:16] brother branham said that was the
[1:43:17] succession of
[1:43:19] pope everybody the devil
[1:43:22] entered animal when god came
[1:43:26] god enter a human being so the devil
[1:43:30] also copy god
[1:43:32] and look for a human being that he's
[1:43:34] gonna be inconnected into him
[1:43:38] but who's going to provide that human
[1:43:40] being
[1:43:41] the succession of beast
[1:43:44] everybody clear praise be the name of
[1:43:47] the lord
[1:43:48] now as sentenced trinity
[1:43:51] less like that satan all the time
[1:43:55] the antichrist antichrist spirit
[1:43:58] incarnate in the false prophet then he
[1:44:01] become the water
[1:44:03] so we have three steps here the first
[1:44:06] step when the devil attack
[1:44:08] he comes as a demon and that demon
[1:44:13] is called the antichrist this is what he
[1:44:16] did
[1:44:16] under the white horse rider
[1:44:20] but later on the horse rather was given
[1:44:23] a crown
[1:44:24] brother branham said you cannot crown a
[1:44:26] spirit
[1:44:27] you need to have a man to put a crown on
[1:44:30] and when he cried into a man that was
[1:44:34] the first time we had the first pop in
[1:44:36] history
[1:44:38] and the pope came up as a beast
[1:44:42] but that beast is not an animal
[1:44:45] it's a human being anybody clear
[1:44:49] when he was incarnated in the pope
[1:44:52] ever here he was called the false
[1:44:55] prophet
[1:44:57] now the last stage we need to have
[1:45:00] a beast just like he was at the
[1:45:03] beginning
[1:45:04] anybody clear so far brother branham say
[1:45:07] now not a demon that's the antichrist
[1:45:11] that was in the antichrist but once
[1:45:14] satan himself is
[1:45:16] kicked out he comes down
[1:45:19] and take over the place where the demon
[1:45:22] was
[1:45:23] yes and back here the devil
[1:45:26] then the devil is incarnated in a water
[1:45:30] it's just water repeating itself
[1:45:35] that is what judas is carrier towards
[1:45:39] [Applause]
[1:45:41] you understand now christ was the
[1:45:45] incarnated what
[1:45:47] god incarnated in flesh emmanuel
[1:45:51] god with us in the beginning was the
[1:45:54] word
[1:45:55] and the word was with god and the word
[1:45:58] was who
[1:45:59] amen and judah was the son
[1:46:02] of perdition and jesus was the son of
[1:46:06] god
[1:46:07] incarnated god jesus incarnated devil
[1:46:11] who
[1:46:12] that's why when christ died judah also
[1:46:15] died
[1:46:16] because both of them need to release
[1:46:18] their spirit
[1:46:19] everybody clear amen
[1:46:22] what is this trail of the serpent now we
[1:46:26] found here
[1:46:27] that this setting after being kicked out
[1:46:30] of heaven
[1:46:31] incarnated himself in the world
[1:46:35] now he is the beast antichrist
[1:46:38] first prophet and now the beast and
[1:46:40] giving the name of water
[1:46:42] and hell follow him fully satan on his
[1:46:46] water
[1:46:47] when they kick him out in heaven he came
[1:46:50] in the garden of eden
[1:46:52] he connected the serpent
[1:46:56] everybody here on the earth he is satan
[1:47:00] representative on earth and he now
[1:47:04] is the head of the kingdom of the world
[1:47:06] the very same kingdom that
[1:47:08] he offered the lord jesus in matthew 4
[1:47:10] satan now become a full king
[1:47:13] now this happens later on he is a false
[1:47:16] prophet now
[1:47:17] he's a pope he will become a beast after
[1:47:20] a while
[1:47:21] when he breaks his covenant there with
[1:47:23] the jews
[1:47:24] he shall be given a heart of what
[1:47:28] remember what happened to nebuchadnezzar
[1:47:33] everybody he won't be given a heart
[1:47:36] of a beast at that time and
[1:47:39] satan will incarnate himself
[1:47:42] because when the church goes water
[1:47:45] satan is done water now he's still the
[1:47:49] accuser
[1:47:50] of the brethren but when we go in the
[1:47:53] rapture
[1:47:54] we cannot live with satan over there
[1:47:57] god is gonna cast satan down but
[1:48:01] as he's coming down he's gonna find a
[1:48:04] purple call spiritually a beast
[1:48:08] and he's gonna incarnate the beast
[1:48:11] then woe to the one who's gonna miss the
[1:48:14] rapture
[1:48:15] because you wanna dealing with a man
[1:48:18] with a heart of a beast everybody cares
[1:48:22] so far
[1:48:24] praise be the name of the lord now the
[1:48:26] beauty
[1:48:27] we found out that lucifer was beautiful
[1:48:30] and the serpent was beautiful
[1:48:32] brother branham say when a man chooses a
[1:48:35] certain guilt
[1:48:36] out of a family make sure i'm online
[1:48:39] okay
[1:48:41] he must not rely upon on what
[1:48:45] for beauty's water because lucifer
[1:48:48] was beautiful when he came down he went
[1:48:52] into the serpent
[1:48:53] beautiful
[1:48:56] everybody here and beauty
[1:48:59] karma you ready
[1:49:02] what beauty modern
[1:49:05] worldly water is off the water
[1:49:09] being beautiful is not a problem
[1:49:16] because we were fashioned by god
[1:49:19] made by god created by god
[1:49:23] but when your beauty become designed
[1:49:27] by the devil then it becomes a
[1:49:31] problem
[1:49:38] hallelujah let me drop this
[1:49:43] by her beauty and her sex control this
[1:49:47] is an immoral woman
[1:49:48] thank you my brother her shepherd that
[1:49:51] gift given
[1:49:52] to her by who the beauty
[1:49:55] saturn doesn't sit on your mother's womb
[1:49:58] to begin to disarm you we already seen
[1:50:01] that
[1:50:03] satan doesn't do that the way you come
[1:50:05] out of your mother
[1:50:07] that's god if you come up with one arm
[1:50:10] missing then that's satan satan come to
[1:50:13] destroy
[1:50:15] if a beautiful baby's born that's not
[1:50:18] certain
[1:50:19] anybody care he said by her beauty
[1:50:24] her sex control her shape
[1:50:27] that was given to her by who so
[1:50:30] you can be born normally
[1:50:35] by a natural beauty a natural
[1:50:39] shape a natural prophet
[1:50:42] but the devil can get you and
[1:50:45] change you
[1:50:49] a man can have a big belly like this let
[1:50:52] him go to the gym
[1:50:54] he's going to have a six-pack everybody
[1:50:57] here
[1:50:58] he was not born with six-pack anybody
[1:51:01] here
[1:51:02] the six-pack and the medication the
[1:51:05] vitamin he takes
[1:51:07] are gonna change his muscles and
[1:51:09] everything and he looked
[1:51:11] different than the way he was created he
[1:51:13] has been designed
[1:51:14] by the gym
[1:51:19] make sense you were born now you are
[1:51:22] designed by the dream
[1:51:24] what you look is not a product of your
[1:51:27] birth
[1:51:28] it is a product of a new work that was
[1:51:31] put upon you
[1:51:38] everybody clear the jezebel
[1:51:41] before the window is a different
[1:51:44] jezebel after the window
[1:51:48] before the window jezebel was natural
[1:51:51] when she presented herself to vamp
[1:51:56] jehu she looked different than when she
[1:51:59] was in her bedroom
[1:52:03] she was now designer
[1:52:09] they byproduct they're certainly
[1:52:13] she is sent to deceive the sons of god
[1:52:17] and she can slay an immoral woman
[1:52:20] more of them to hell than any other
[1:52:24] instrument satan has got because he's
[1:52:27] working
[1:52:28] in the weakness of a woman and the
[1:52:30] beauty of a woman
[1:52:32] anybody clear so far blessed be the name
[1:52:35] of the lord
[1:52:37] that is the reason sometime
[1:52:42] sometimes some times
[1:52:45] not all the time
[1:52:49] read your prophet well sometimes
[1:52:53] a view a pretty woman is a
[1:52:56] bed for water not all the time
[1:53:00] sometime the serpent was beautiful
[1:53:05] but the serpent have the maha
[1:53:09] he was crafty he was saddle
[1:53:13] those character plus beauty
[1:53:17] attracted the devil to her
[1:53:20] anybody being beautiful is not
[1:53:24] a problem but the condition
[1:53:27] of your heart might pull the devil
[1:53:30] towards you
[1:53:32] because your heart is not in good
[1:53:35] condition with god
[1:53:37] then the devil can use you just like he
[1:53:41] used the serpent
[1:53:46] anybody care a pretty woman
[1:53:49] is a begged for satan sometimes
[1:53:52] if he can just get a hold of her he can
[1:53:55] twist
[1:53:56] more men into hell than he could
[1:53:59] with all the bathrooms in the country
[1:54:02] that's right
[1:54:03] oh and what
[1:54:07] not only systems a handsome
[1:54:10] some great handsome man that would
[1:54:13] not stand up in the world
[1:54:17] in his trueness of water so there is a
[1:54:21] womanhood
[1:54:23] and there is also a manhood just as
[1:54:27] women are not supposed to break the
[1:54:29] womanhood
[1:54:31] men also are not supposed to break their
[1:54:34] manhood
[1:54:36] because the devil can anoint you to
[1:54:39] destroy the daughters of
[1:54:40] god anybody care
[1:54:45] see again he can swing them women
[1:54:48] to the devil and send them to hell
[1:54:51] yes sir nothing certain to us in what
[1:54:55] we see that in ezekiel what did he try
[1:54:59] to do in the beginning
[1:55:00] make a more beautiful kingdom then who
[1:55:04] because my car was crushed christ
[1:55:07] created the devil was not pleased
[1:55:10] he wanted to take what was created and
[1:55:13] make it
[1:55:14] beautiful by perversion hey but here
[1:55:18] not by creation blessed be the name of
[1:55:21] the lord
[1:55:22] hallelujah but in the human race
[1:55:26] it is the woman that is pretty not the
[1:55:29] man
[1:55:30] originally it's that way why was he done
[1:55:34] to deceive by her designer satan
[1:55:37] is still water satan doesn't go into the
[1:55:41] womb to work on women
[1:55:43] but he's working on women by designing
[1:55:46] women
[1:55:49] everybody here her designer saturn
[1:55:53] is still working on her too in this
[1:55:55] water
[1:55:57] how is set and working there is nothing
[1:56:00] that can stoop like her
[1:56:02] she's designed so that she can be
[1:56:04] deceived and satan is really working on
[1:56:07] her today
[1:56:08] in this last day because he is her
[1:56:10] designer
[1:56:12] who started to work on her adam
[1:56:15] or satan god or satan
[1:56:19] see that is her what it
[1:56:22] is her chief weapon to throw man
[1:56:26] to her weapon so the designing
[1:56:30] of the devil is to take a natural woman
[1:56:34] and cause that woman as a tool
[1:56:38] to bring men to uncleanness
[1:56:42] anybody care being a pretty woman
[1:56:47] she can sway a man any way she want to
[1:56:50] it's the pretty woman walking down on
[1:56:52] the water
[1:56:54] doing water twisting herself and water
[1:56:58] that is what takes that is the deceiver
[1:57:02] well
[1:57:03] and she is deadly with it
[1:57:07] absolutely water so
[1:57:10] eve was innocent in the beginning
[1:57:14] no shame no concept of nakedness
[1:57:17] if was walking normal eve was talking
[1:57:20] normal
[1:57:21] if was created beautiful if was
[1:57:24] unconscious
[1:57:25] on this part all the way down it is the
[1:57:29] devil i explained to you
[1:57:30] that came to eve and engage into
[1:57:34] a discussion with eve and begin to teach
[1:57:37] eve
[1:57:38] to walk a certain way
[1:57:46] hallelujah let's continue
[1:57:50] how much alike that man and his wife
[1:57:54] buffing gods in god's edom without
[1:57:57] one what stitch of clothes on them
[1:58:00] and knew it not for why didn't they know
[1:58:04] it
[1:58:05] for they were there to the senses of
[1:58:08] water nakedness by water
[1:58:11] by the holy veil of the water
[1:58:15] the holy spirit they could look right at
[1:58:18] each other and they didn't know
[1:58:21] that they were naked they were there
[1:58:24] with the holy spirit of holiness
[1:58:27] they were veiled god's veil yet today
[1:58:30] can look
[1:58:31] and not last they turned their head it's
[1:58:34] a holy veil
[1:58:35] holy veil god had their eyes
[1:58:38] they were both one man and the other was
[1:58:42] woman
[1:58:42] and they didn't know they were naked
[1:58:44] because the holiness of god
[1:58:47] kept their eyes veiled notice god
[1:58:50] hit the water from water
[1:58:54] that's why a little girl can walk naked
[1:58:57] and she doesn't care
[1:58:59] because her conscience is seared
[1:59:03] everybody clear the black dog is
[1:59:06] completely
[1:59:07] off of her anybody care
[1:59:10] wish we had some time to lay on there
[1:59:13] a few minutes look here he said the
[1:59:16] worshiper wants water
[1:59:18] as the worship at once purge has no more
[1:59:22] water
[1:59:24] conscience brother brother says it means
[1:59:28] desire
[1:59:30] so if an adam
[1:59:34] did not have the desire
[1:59:40] to sin but when the serpent
[1:59:44] spoke to eve the bible says that eve
[1:59:48] so that the tree was good for food
[1:59:52] and one desired
[1:59:57] to make one water
[2:00:00] what is that wisdom what is it
[2:00:04] james one but every man
[2:00:08] is tempted when he's joined away
[2:00:11] of his own what and what
[2:00:15] so lust must be finding you first
[2:00:18] and then the devil uses your own lust
[2:00:22] and begin to pull you away from your own
[2:00:24] lust
[2:00:27] that's why we need to check the
[2:00:29] condition of our heart
[2:00:32] that's why malachi forecam to turn the
[2:00:35] water
[2:00:38] everybody here because the devil
[2:00:42] will use what you already have and begin
[2:00:45] to pull you
[2:00:46] off of them that's why brother branham
[2:00:48] said you need to cover
[2:00:50] your weak spot
[2:00:58] if you know that you have a problem with
[2:01:00] lust
[2:01:03] put your computer in the living room
[2:01:10] amen then when lust
[2:01:13] has water when you really swallow it
[2:01:18] and you agree with it like eve then your
[2:01:20] eyes
[2:01:21] change when lust has conceived
[2:01:25] it brings off water and
[2:01:29] sin when it's finished when eve ate
[2:01:34] of the fruit ever care when it
[2:01:37] consumes the fruit and work here
[2:01:40] then it brings water he starts
[2:01:43] by a lust a desire
[2:01:47] a feeling and that feeling
[2:01:51] will birth something and that birth
[2:01:54] will lead you to sin and that sin will
[2:01:57] open the door for what death
[2:02:00] romans 6 23 for the wages of
[2:02:04] sin is water you understand why sin lead
[2:02:07] to death
[2:02:08] because it's the salary of sin once
[2:02:10] you've already seen
[2:02:12] there is a salary coming up they're
[2:02:14] going to pay you very well
[2:02:16] and the pay is death hallelujah
[2:02:19] but the gift of god is water eternal
[2:02:22] life to
[2:02:23] jesus christ our lord that's why brother
[2:02:26] bradham said the tree of life was christ
[2:02:29] because christ carried eternal life the
[2:02:32] apostle james
[2:02:34] showed us the course that sin takes
[2:02:38] the path of sin james one brother
[2:02:41] branham read the scripture
[2:02:42] yesterday he said as sin
[2:02:46] started in nothing but the water
[2:02:49] just the feeling and the devil can use
[2:02:52] that feeling
[2:02:53] and pull you away outside of god
[2:02:56] promise everybody certain sydney
[2:03:00] she was naked in needham the two kingdom
[2:03:03] alike
[2:03:04] one is the law sin and death
[2:03:07] the other one is life and righteousness
[2:03:11] is there in there she was there with the
[2:03:13] holy veil
[2:03:14] they were both naked they didn't know
[2:03:17] they didn't know nothing about it
[2:03:19] because they were water there with god's
[2:03:22] water
[2:03:24] but the devil brought a different
[2:03:27] wisdom what is that wisdom
[2:03:31] james 3 verse 15 the wisdom this wisdom
[2:03:36] descended not from earth from above
[2:03:40] but it's what it's a worldly wisdom
[2:03:43] which is what and what
[2:03:47] the definition of essentially is
[2:03:50] something that is related to
[2:03:53] or involving gratification
[2:03:56] of the senses and physical especially
[2:04:00] sexual
[2:04:04] so the wisdom that the devil brought
[2:04:07] to evil was a sexual wisdom
[2:04:12] because he has the maha he knew biology
[2:04:15] very well anybody care
[2:04:18] he knew that and out of me pretty well
[2:04:21] now
[2:04:22] in the last churches we found here that
[2:04:25] they are naked again
[2:04:27] certain seeded and don't know but it's
[2:04:29] not the holy spirit veil
[2:04:32] it is the veil that satan sleep over eve
[2:04:35] back then you understand now a
[2:04:38] veil of water you understand now
[2:04:42] a veil of lust the last veil
[2:04:45] they are so filthy till they don't know
[2:04:48] that they are naked our women on the
[2:04:51] street
[2:04:52] we've short on sexy dress you can see a
[2:04:55] woman today
[2:04:56] dressed with a long skirt but he even
[2:04:59] shows the curvature of her back
[2:05:02] who's discerning that
[2:05:05] god perverted from innocence
[2:05:08] don't miss this now the church has been
[2:05:12] with the last veil on notice what it's
[2:05:14] done here
[2:05:15] it perverted her from a nonsense to
[2:05:18] water
[2:05:20] which knowledge the holy veil she was
[2:05:23] innocent with the last veil she is now
[2:05:27] knowledgeable she knows it's pleasant
[2:05:30] who told you
[2:05:31] she knows what he does it's a fruit
[2:05:34] a tree to be desired making one water
[2:05:39] that wisdom she is perverted from
[2:05:42] a nonsense to who to knowledge
[2:05:46] from holiness to what and what
[2:05:49] and from life to water take exodus 32.
[2:05:56] so if in onsen don't know anything about
[2:06:00] the nakedness
[2:06:01] and the shame but the devil brought the
[2:06:04] knowledge
[2:06:05] and that knowledge took her from knowing
[2:06:08] nothing
[2:06:09] to being a phd professor
[2:06:16] everybody clear and she had two schools
[2:06:22] she had the teaching part about clear
[2:06:26] and she led she has the or the
[2:06:29] laboratory part
[2:06:31] because when you learn biology you learn
[2:06:34] biology
[2:06:35] as a concept then you go to the lab
[2:06:38] to practice
[2:06:45] exodus 32 if you're there you can say
[2:06:49] amen
[2:06:50] verse one and moses said to aaron
[2:06:53] what did this people to you that you
[2:06:56] have bought
[2:06:57] such a great sin upon them and aaron say
[2:07:01] let not the anger of my lord works hard
[2:07:05] you know the people that they are set on
[2:07:08] mischief
[2:07:08] the desire of israel was already wrong
[2:07:11] for they said to me
[2:07:13] make us what what did lucifer propose
[2:07:16] eve
[2:07:18] to be like what
[2:07:21] okay make us god we shall go before us
[2:07:26] for us for this moses the man
[2:07:29] that brought us up out of the land of
[2:07:31] egypt we know not what has become of him
[2:07:34] and i said to them whosoever has
[2:07:37] any gold let them break it off so they
[2:07:40] gave me
[2:07:41] then i cast it into the fire and there
[2:07:44] came out this cuff
[2:07:47] so the calf just came out oh he was the
[2:07:50] one working on it
[2:07:52] but when moses is asking no no no i just
[2:07:54] put and the fire and the calf came
[2:07:56] out
[2:07:59] accountability are you there
[2:08:02] watch verse 25 and when moses saw
[2:08:06] that the people were what
[2:08:11] i thought israel had clothed
[2:08:15] you see now when the people saw that
[2:08:18] they were naked
[2:08:19] for aaron had made them water
[2:08:24] to their water remember nakedness and
[2:08:27] shame goes together
[2:08:29] naked to them and made them naked to the
[2:08:32] shem
[2:08:33] among their water when sin
[2:08:36] entered he uncovered nakedness
[2:08:42] israel was there the sin of aaron
[2:08:46] made israel naked
[2:08:49] you follow me now now get this now
[2:08:53] what is this knowledge you ready
[2:08:57] praise god satan did it
[2:09:01] by the woman water for water
[2:09:08] remember eve says serpent sit here
[2:09:12] and tell me what it is she showed the
[2:09:15] interest and that interest is what the
[2:09:18] devil pulled
[2:09:19] make sense for sex
[2:09:23] which she chose by her own choosing
[2:09:27] he was if
[2:09:31] that led adam to the water
[2:09:34] that's why adam said it's not me the one
[2:09:37] who taught me
[2:09:39] is the woman everybody here and it was
[2:09:42] the woman
[2:09:43] that took off her clothes before
[2:09:47] her adam took it off
[2:09:51] so when adam came and adam
[2:09:54] looked at him eve had her clothes
[2:09:58] already off that cloth
[2:10:02] was a holy cloth everybody clear
[2:10:06] if you used to walk a certain way
[2:10:08] everybody care
[2:10:10] but when the devil came
[2:10:13] and taught ease and disarming even
[2:10:17] and took is to the laboratory and
[2:10:21] work on ease and how to
[2:10:24] twist herself how to twist her hips
[2:10:28] when adam came and saw if
[2:10:32] walking a different way than eve was
[2:10:35] walking
[2:10:37] then adam look at eve
[2:10:41] and begin to last
[2:10:50] he was eve that led adam
[2:10:53] to the wrong he was the woman that took
[2:10:56] off her clothes
[2:10:58] before adam took off his it's the woman
[2:11:02] always it's always been it's still the
[2:11:05] same thing
[2:11:06] now notice by what sex
[2:11:09] desire of sex she lasted for knowledge
[2:11:12] to know what what was this
[2:11:15] and how whether this fruit was good or
[2:11:18] not and she did it
[2:11:21] eve could not sin until
[2:11:24] she laid a sad god's word opening up her
[2:11:28] water
[2:11:29] of water through her water
[2:11:33] and begin to do water everybody clear
[2:11:37] wow certainly
[2:11:41] my husband has never told me these
[2:11:43] things
[2:11:45] i believe that's you serpent
[2:11:48] he told me i should not do this but you
[2:11:51] know serpent
[2:11:52] you make it so real and so plain
[2:11:56] he was a teacher i believe it will be
[2:11:59] wonderful because you are making it so
[2:12:02] plain to me
[2:12:04] you need a prophet to see this
[2:12:08] everybody clear ever clear you need a
[2:12:11] prophet to see this
[2:12:13] the devil came down and got into the
[2:12:17] serpent i just explained this
[2:12:19] and he found eve in the garden of eden
[2:12:22] naked he talked about the fruit
[2:12:25] in the midst the meat means water
[2:12:30] and so forth you understand in a mixed
[2:12:33] congregation
[2:12:34] and he said now it's pleasant it's good
[2:12:37] to the eyes
[2:12:38] what did he do he begin to make
[2:12:41] making love to eve and he lived with her
[2:12:45] as a water and she's saw
[2:12:48] he was pleasant so she went and told her
[2:12:51] what
[2:12:53] the job is done the devil wiped his
[2:12:56] hand and he's out now eve will continue
[2:13:00] that religion everybody clear your trail
[2:13:03] of the serpent
[2:13:06] just like he was on the serpentine but
[2:13:09] it's absolutely proven to be right
[2:13:11] i got paper right here out of the paper
[2:13:14] when a woman right now some of these
[2:13:16] great juices
[2:13:17] has got the picture of the original a
[2:13:20] snake
[2:13:21] crawling on a woman's water and just
[2:13:24] in how he goes around here i explain you
[2:13:27] this
[2:13:28] she has all kind of sensation and things
[2:13:32] something a man could never
[2:13:35] touch her with with this
[2:13:39] huge snake wrapping around and so forth
[2:13:43] that is exactly the truth it's going
[2:13:46] worse than worst it will get worse
[2:13:50] serpent he could not have had the sex
[2:13:53] affair
[2:13:54] with when he was a water brother branham
[2:13:57] said
[2:13:58] they took a serpent and the wrap hell
[2:14:01] and the robbed the serpent around the
[2:14:03] woman and the serpent
[2:14:05] produces something that no man can touch
[2:14:08] because the first time he hurt
[2:14:12] you need the serpent to take you to a
[2:14:14] level of anesthesia
[2:14:17] and if you notice there was only two act
[2:14:21] done
[2:14:22] and there was three children born he
[2:14:24] corrected now she gave birth to twins
[2:14:27] too one of them was the serpenty and the
[2:14:30] other one was able
[2:14:32] she enticed her husband
[2:14:35] so eve never came and just say adam take
[2:14:38] this and eat
[2:14:39] that was not what eve said eve begin to
[2:14:42] seduce adam
[2:14:45] because adam was still under the veil
[2:14:48] so if the serpent taught eve
[2:14:51] how to remove the veil amen
[2:14:54] so they even went to adam and begin to
[2:14:57] take off the veil from adam
[2:15:03] she enters her husband then
[2:15:06] she did what showed her husband
[2:15:10] what he was and then he
[2:15:13] lived with her also it was jezebel
[2:15:17] teaching the teaching of a woman notice
[2:15:21] it was if that satan used to make adam
[2:15:24] water
[2:15:25] by her water now eve
[2:15:28] became an instrument that can cause adam
[2:15:31] to
[2:15:32] look and last then commit what
[2:15:35] adultery now the same
[2:15:39] doing the same thing today how
[2:15:42] bout her painted face
[2:15:46] sexually dressed she does that and
[2:15:50] don't know that every one of those
[2:15:52] things
[2:15:53] is contrary to the water to cut her hair
[2:15:57] make her a dishonorable woman a
[2:16:00] prostitute
[2:16:01] to wear shorts put her disgracefully
[2:16:05] put sexy dress on make her a what
[2:16:09] because the last stuff satan she calls
[2:16:12] her
[2:16:13] she calls her adam to last after water
[2:16:16] so the devil understood now the devil
[2:16:19] uses the woman and design her clothing
[2:16:24] and design everything that a woman can
[2:16:27] put on instead of concealing
[2:16:31] covering her shape and her sex
[2:16:35] the woman now is wearing clothing
[2:16:38] that exposes and reveal
[2:16:41] her shape to cause lust
[2:16:44] to the sons of adam
[2:16:47] man looks at natural beauty
[2:16:50] it's deceiving that is why a woman was
[2:16:54] given that beauty for deception
[2:16:56] a beautiful woman if she don't use it
[2:16:59] the right way
[2:17:00] it is a curse to her that will send her
[2:17:03] to hell quicker
[2:17:05] than anything else i know if she can be
[2:17:08] pretty sure
[2:17:09] as long as she stay with her water and
[2:17:12] that's what is what
[2:17:14] that is fine and dandy but she can
[2:17:17] take that same thing how she can deceive
[2:17:21] with it
[2:17:22] for he was given to her to do
[2:17:25] everybody clear let me head to the
[2:17:27] airport
[2:17:29] she gave birth to twins one of them
[2:17:32] was the serpentine the other one was
[2:17:35] able i read this already
[2:17:37] that this fellow found eve in the garden
[2:17:40] of eden
[2:17:41] this young woman that know no sin
[2:17:44] know if not what her nakedness was and
[2:17:47] he knew
[2:17:48] he was smart brother kelly saddle
[2:17:51] wise and he told her the fruit was
[2:17:54] pleasant
[2:17:55] and he was desirable when he leave with
[2:17:58] her
[2:17:58] that morning then the afternoon she did
[2:18:02] water
[2:18:03] she persuaded adam to do the same thing
[2:18:06] telling him what he that's why god said
[2:18:10] you listen to the voice of
[2:18:12] eve the woman was the one
[2:18:16] that was white she was
[2:18:20] designed over for perversion
[2:18:24] change over for water not created
[2:18:28] that's why see where the beauty takes
[2:18:31] her to
[2:18:32] now that is why today we found that
[2:18:35] women
[2:18:35] is on the increase of water france
[2:18:39] which has been the seat of satan
[2:18:42] paris for 100 years women
[2:18:45] vulgarity nastiness we used to go
[2:18:48] there 25 years ago to get their water
[2:18:53] to put on our water we got so low
[2:18:56] till they come out of here and get our
[2:18:59] design
[2:19:00] to put on their women that's right
[2:19:03] newspaper
[2:19:04] and magazine picks it up and the poor
[2:19:07] people are water
[2:19:09] what is the devil doing today that
[2:19:12] design
[2:19:13] when you were the designer the designer
[2:19:15] we're designing the clothes
[2:19:17] it is the devil knowing the weakness of
[2:19:19] the body of a woman
[2:19:21] and using the beauty not to conceal
[2:19:25] but to reveal that's why you look at
[2:19:28] every woman almost that is on the street
[2:19:32] their clothes are tight
[2:19:35] have you seen that going to the wedding
[2:19:38] going to a wedding that is not a message
[2:19:41] believe a wedding
[2:19:43] going to one of the wedding you're going
[2:19:45] to have a hard time
[2:19:47] because you will see all the men in suit
[2:19:50] wearing very good you're going to see
[2:19:52] every single woman almost
[2:19:54] 99.9 wearing tight clothes
[2:19:58] amen and the tight cloth they wear if
[2:20:01] they give you a pepper
[2:20:03] you can sit and join
[2:20:06] amen and today they have even clothing
[2:20:09] that show every morphology
[2:20:13] where god brought the skin to clothes
[2:20:16] to protect so that when men see you
[2:20:20] they don't really know how you are but
[2:20:22] the clothing today
[2:20:24] are tight so you can see the curvature
[2:20:27] you can see everything every curve a
[2:20:30] woman is doing
[2:20:32] it is revealing the nakedness of a woman
[2:20:36] and that revelation of the nakedness
[2:20:39] will bring lust and at last
[2:20:43] will cause a man to commit adultery with
[2:20:47] you
[2:20:47] in his what that's why form
[2:20:50] feeding clothes that are tight are wrong
[2:20:54] for a woman because god gave the
[2:20:57] clothing
[2:20:58] to cover not to reveal
[2:21:02] amen the devil is smart you wear a long
[2:21:06] dress but that dress is tight it's
[2:21:09] showing
[2:21:10] what you tried to cover your dress is
[2:21:13] long
[2:21:14] but we can still see what is going on
[2:21:16] you are now
[2:21:17] causing lust and by causing lust
[2:21:20] you are anointed by who
[2:21:24] everybody clears so far everybody clears
[2:21:26] your phone
[2:21:27] now what was supposed to be covered by
[2:21:29] god
[2:21:30] the sex and the form of shape now what
[2:21:33] he does
[2:21:34] it is unfolding that's why a woman body
[2:21:37] is a different body because he was
[2:21:39] created with weakness
[2:21:41] he need to be protected he need to be
[2:21:44] shielded he need to be concealed not
[2:21:48] revealing because when it's revealed
[2:21:51] it caused trouble now the next time
[2:21:54] we're gonna see how the high heel will
[2:21:58] affect this form
[2:22:00] and then accentuate that
[2:22:03] to make sure even though you wear a long
[2:22:06] dress men will still see
[2:22:08] what the devil wants you to see
[2:22:10] everybody clear
[2:22:12] that will be part 43 let's stand there
[2:22:22] [Applause]
[2:22:26] if you were worrying about time i
[2:22:28] finished nine minutes before
[2:22:35] amen this teaching
[2:22:38] goes like we went in eternity
[2:22:41] and it feels like oh we went into a
[2:22:43] journey
[2:22:45] we did it yes in the journey in the mind
[2:22:48] of god yes
[2:22:50] but he was here the reason why we went
[2:22:52] through this
[2:22:54] if i tell you don't wear tight clothes
[2:22:55] you won't understand
[2:22:58] if i tell you don't wear short clothes
[2:23:00] you won't understand
[2:23:02] it's going to be a legalistic view
[2:23:06] and when you leave the message you start
[2:23:08] wearing the same clothes
[2:23:10] because you thought it was a legalistic
[2:23:12] view you didn't understand
[2:23:14] amen holiness he's in the message
[2:23:18] holiness was preached by
[2:23:20] wesley amen
[2:23:23] so it's not something that people
[2:23:24] connected to the message the message the
[2:23:26] message
[2:23:26] the problem is you didn't understand why
[2:23:29] so now you understand
[2:23:31] that the body of a woman is a special
[2:23:33] body
[2:23:34] everybody else was created on the
[2:23:36] original the woman was the one
[2:23:38] created by the second creation by
[2:23:42] a by product make sense
[2:23:45] amen that's why you protect your
[2:23:48] yourself more than a man amen
[2:23:52] and what branham say even men have to
[2:23:54] stay
[2:23:55] on the true manhood that's why
[2:23:58] men should now wear tight paint
[2:24:03] everybody clear almost we have in a hard
[2:24:06] time
[2:24:07] finding suit nowadays because almost all
[2:24:10] the suits they're making
[2:24:12] the top is good and the bottom is tight
[2:24:16] why satan want to reveal something
[2:24:19] that is hidden amen
[2:24:24] those are homosexual
[2:24:27] spirit that was a tight tight pen
[2:24:31] amen when a man sits you see them tight
[2:24:34] that's
[2:24:34] homosexual but he was prophesied that
[2:24:38] the earth is going to be under the
[2:24:40] sword of my condition wow the last
[2:24:44] on the man and the last on the women
[2:24:47] that's why hell is on earth we are
[2:24:50] living in
[2:24:51] satan seeded very bad clear
[2:24:54] so watch your clothing i'm not gonna sit
[2:24:57] here telling you this is two millimeter

[2:25:08] revealing me or is he concealing me
[2:25:13] anybody clear am i revealing my form
[2:25:17] am i unfolding myself or am i
[2:25:20] concealing myself whenever you put a
[2:25:23] cloth
[2:25:24] that you see you are revealing yourself
[2:25:26] just know
[2:25:28] you're already breaking your womanhood
[2:25:31] amen when the clothes are tight here the
[2:25:34] clothes are tight here
[2:25:36] until they can form ever and i'm gonna
[2:25:38] show you when we deal with the high heel
[2:25:41] brother branham isn't saying about the
[2:25:42] bra of a women
[2:25:44] they were a certain bra that were made
[2:25:47] to
[2:25:48] boost the chest of a woman to cause
[2:25:52] lust everybody clear i'm going to show
[2:25:55] you the quotes from brother branham
[2:25:57] amen the problem is causing lust
[2:26:01] and that's why brother branham said in
[2:26:02] the day of judgment
[2:26:04] you're going to find yourself answering
[2:26:06] for adultery
[2:26:09] yet you've never done it but the way you
[2:26:12] form yourself the way

[2:26:33] legalistic view it is the word of god
[2:26:36] proven by the bible proven by the
[2:26:39] scripture that's why brother branham say
[2:26:41] dress like a lady amen
[2:26:44] you cannot look at the lady dress well
[2:26:47] and you begin to last after her
[2:26:49] if you have that something is wrong with

[2:29:52] father most then all we know
[2:29:55] and we understand that the hour is
[2:29:58] treacherous
[2:30:01] and it's very imperative that the holy
[2:30:04] spirit comes
[2:30:05] and help your children father without a
[2:30:09] personal revelation
[2:30:11] that you can give to an individual a
[2:30:14] young man
[2:30:15] or a young sister we can preach like
[2:30:18] this and they won't get it
[2:30:20] and they will go out and continue to do
[2:30:22] the same thing
[2:30:24] but as a shepherd father i am pleading
[2:30:27] that lord father you be merciful to
[2:30:30] great unto us
[2:30:32] lord that revelation to understand the
[2:30:34] sacredness
[2:30:36] father of the body that you have given
[2:30:39] us
[2:30:40] father you spoke in your word that you
[2:30:42] have given a woman three sacred virtues
[2:30:46] motherhood womanhood and virginity lord
[2:30:49] father here you are emphasizing on more
[2:30:52] on womanhood
[2:30:53] on the behavior of a woman the way she
[2:30:56] presented herself
[2:30:58] before men the way she portray and the
[2:31:00] way a young man
[2:31:02] should present themselves father even
[2:31:05] under the air among the young people
