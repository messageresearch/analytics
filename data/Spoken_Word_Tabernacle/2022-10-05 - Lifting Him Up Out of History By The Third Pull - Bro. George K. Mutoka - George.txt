tonight I know it's Wednesday you've been at work tired but it's a sacrifice unto the Lord amen glory to God glory to God we continue to remember Brother Rich in prayer I spoke to him today he's doing well he was uh he went to our surgery for gallbladder so by God's grace he's a home just going through pain post-op pan so he's taking medication it's helping but he told me to mention he greet you all he said mention to the church to continue to remember me in prayer for fast recovery you need to say it down not driving for so many days not lifting weight so many days until gradually you get here oh man but so far he's doing wonderful amen everything is okay everything is under control you do what the Nightingale is supposed to amen glory to God you continue to read the book of Daniel it's a very complicated book if the holy spirit is not gracious to you especially if we didn't have a prophet it could have been hard but thank God for the prophet and thank God for the second oil I try I mentioned about the compound meaning on the seven heads you remember mentioned about seven heads being seven hills and another seven heads being seven Kings and he was not in the Book of Daniel but I saw it hidden somewhere so your boss opened up so continue to read I want you to keep getting the material if you don't read Daniel if we preach you'll be completely lost amen but if you read it two three times and you soak the material when we're going through it will be easier because the holy spirit will Quicken quickly Daniel it's like the Book of Revelation of the Old Testament amen so if you know what is in the Book of Revelation so many symbols that's exactly the way Daniel work amen it's a lot of symbols a lot of healing stuff and a lot of compound meaning there so continue to read even if you read you already finished go back again read it refresh your memory and we see how the Lord will help us on Sunday again how to take off but the airplane still the military one everybody okay so make sure you get some rest amen I am not preaching tonight even though I have the microphone on me I am actually translating we have a brother brother John mutoka but John mutoka is a head Deacon of one of the biggest Message Church in the world from brother vividella so he has been a head Deacon for years and by God's grace he came to Kentucky visit his daughter so he passed on the Carolina he's leaving tomorrow so by God's grace the door was open that he can minister to us he is a deacon a head Deacon for years a big church I don't know if it's 30 Deacon or something like that so you can tell how big the church is so he has a great responsibility back home and we felt like it's an honor to have him ministered to us tonight amen so you relax everything will be okay pull on the gift of the Lord and the Lord will speak for us tonight amen so I will be calling him brother George if he can come in with only believe I will use that nice and that book stand but if you can help me with it [Music] all things are possible [Music] possible [Music] wrongly Lord I believe Lord I believe God [Music] oh die baby possible [Music] one more time Jesus is here [Music] all things are impossible [Music] Jesus Jesus is here [Music] back using amen [Music] let's pray [Music] father we're so thankful tonight because we are here on the by your grace when we remember Calvary how you offered your only begotten son so that whom however can believe perish not but may he have everlasting classes and it's because of Calvary that we have the entire message Father we thank you for that father we need your anointing tonight [Music] me and the brother translating me and the entire church because you know the needs that is in the heart of and you are able to anoint us and to speak through Us by giving us an inspiration with this anointing and Revelation may you granted unto us Lord so that we leave this building blessed in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen thank you very much you might be seated a lot of be yeah I would like first to thank brother Stephen because of the confidence he have in US yeah and also opening the door for his puppet because we know that through the pulpit that's where the seed land come from so if you bring a wrong seed you know it's going to cause trouble but today we only have one seed which is the spoken word of God amen amen so we will make a lot of noise around the world the reveal word of the hours and we will try the best that we can to repeat what the prophet saying something that can help somebody tonight we thank the Lord Jesus Christ who helped me this is my first time in the United States and we came from a church dedication in Lexington Kentucky so the Lord opened his way so we can make it to North Carolina so we thank God for that so let's go straight to the reading of the words I only have one passage of a scripture to read tonight and you well know it it's a Hebrew 13 8. Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever may the Lord bless the reading of his word you might be seated amen Hallelujah I have to check my time event it's already 8 20. okay it's all right yes sir the brother the pastor told me you have an hour and 30 minutes but if the Lord permit maybe 30 minutes but uh I just believe um surrender myself to God if he take me to one hour 35. but I don't want to go beyond the time I love it amen amen my subject tonight is lifting him up out of History [Music] by the third pool [Music] inspiration this small revelation [Music] I can call it a small inspiration or a lot of exhortation tonight comma um like a lot of inspiration that I received from the Lord as I was making my way to North Carolina you see every step in my trip was a success to the point that I was witnessing the hand of the Lord in every step that I was going but at a certain time when I was meditating on my trip [Music] it was like a thought that was speaking Within Myself and that thought was repeating he came out of History now he's working with his people exactly like he did it for Paul a and that really caught me yes and I felt like I need to listen to that message because brother Brown and preach about it that precious I believe he was uh the October the 1st 1958 and when I listened to that sermon lifting him out of History so I was so inspired for my own life and whenever I have a door open I will preach about it and that's the reason why tonight I will try to share with you that inspiration there is so many things we can talk about it but we will try to summarize and to give you a thought that can help each one of us tonight because we know that the message we receive is that's what was spoken to brother Branham at the river or Ohio the first coming of the Lord you also have a message to prepare the second coming of the Lord and most of the time we are led to destruction Sometimes women find ourselves arguing about it or uh quarreling about the message or still lasting after the world or doing things that are contrary to the world at that point we are not preparing ourselves and then we don't want to be disappointed so it's always good for us to stay awake to help one another with something that the Lord can give us as an inspiration just listen to this word at the beginning of this sermon lifting him out of History in paragraph one brother Branham says I'm just going to take what is necessary for the sake of time privilege I consider this to be a great privilege to remember this is Brother Brown I'm saying himself to be here at the Tabernacle tonight amen privilege and I believe that I deemed to be a great privilege myself because you are the Redeemer of the Lord because the Son of God shed his own blood for you so that this message somebody must shed his blood all throughout the ages we know that John the Baptist was killed he shared his word amen amen foreign [Applause] as we see his word unveiling itself day by day Reston prepared so we have to say as close as we can with the Lord and with his word amen amen so my brother my sister tonight as brother Branham told us tonight and here we are in the time that the word has been unveiled itself he said as we see his word unveiling itself day by day how many of them in 1933 a vision came and spoke to him William Branham preached the word do the work of an evangelist and he preached the pure word and it was God that was revealing to him the word I don't want to spend more time here because I might reached a point where I have not reached my point so let me keep making my noise but I want you to know this that this great message is the revelation of the entire word of God [Applause] it is the revelation of all the hidden truth throughout the ages until the cloud you see I mean of the second Twitter when in 1958 he is already declaring that okay as we see his word being unveiled day by day oh yeah so there is a deep right here that we can dig into help each one of us to have a Clear Vision about the end times oh brothers and sisters we thank the Lord for this and we thank him from the bottom of our house to send us the revealed word amen lifting him out of History by the third pool why not listen to brother Branham himself the inspiration lifting him up out of History we all know we know that the Lord Jesus Christ have three parts in his ministry [Music] and I really want to talk about brother Branham there is Divine Healing he was holding people by the hands and he says the vibrations you speak the blessing and pray for the patients and the man know the woman was here and the second pool was prophecy he could look at someone and tell that person where he was coming from the thoughts and intent of his heart amen amen and then he moved on to the third floor oh brothers and sisters and that's where really that's why I want to make some noise tonight and I want to say this tonight I believe you all know you are acquainted with this had been impersonated to the point that okay foreign [Music] [Music] there won't be any copy with this and he went to another dimensions [Music] because he had a little child shoe that he was trying to listen and it was a little show um but he was using the wrong side and he was not going through and the same man came back he said this is not the way you do it if you turn it this way look and he told him interpret the vision he says you cannot teach Pentecostal baby spiritual things inside there they cannot explain anything so in that particular party the pillar of fires and went and stood on top of that building and the man that was fitting to him he said we'll meet you right there and that will be the third floor amen amen hello so the female name brother Branham since that time 800 and we expected this it was so he was under the expectation of the purple he stay alert waiting all the time for the third book that really will cut my heart the Prophet The Prophet was knowing that there was a third pool coming up so brother Brandon was on the look so that he doesn't miss that third floor that's why listen to what brother brand I'm saying so from paragraph three in the version that I have here brother Branham says this is there was I was told in a vision that the lord gave me few years ago I'm just gonna take the highlight of the vision keeping my thoughts on what I'm trying to say because you must know how to score and to play the ball amen amen we don't want to misinterpret the word we don't wanna took the word out of its context those are the two things that we have been warned by brother in this message [Music] so we are are remembering and respecting the three amen amen in decency and brother Branham says [Music] and I wrote it in a book at home and it's concerning the change in my Ministry are we oh yes the ministry have to change he had to receive the turtle amen hello now continue I'm gonna continue brother Branham says this important so he remind us of something he here very important he said but remember when we first built the Tabernacle you remember the vision that came in the morning when we laid the corner and told me the difference that the different things will take place so they took brother Branham and lift him up to the sky do the work often eventually begin to travel all over the world preaching the word of God and many things happened that's when the first sentence was manifested all around the world if you can remember and you watch that come to pass just exactly as he was what God thought brother he came to pass exactly like he was told [Music] [Music] surely that what he says it is and it has to be true so when God sent him despite all the opposition against him he didn't listen to The Voice he said I will move forward because God told me to go amen amen [Music] with the hands up quietly and so forth amen foreign [Applause] he went from me and went to run over that little Bill they said and stood there then went down and the voice spoke and say I will meet you in that place I have looked forward for that time so since that Vision under expectation to meet God there and then said then said the predication and in this sermon when brother Branham was preaching he spoke to the church he says he said I'm still waiting on it because he was coming from a missionary trip and he said he is second when I came back foreign [Music] temporarily working [Music] was to identify its own presence day aunties are saying that I am already there even though you don't see me I am already there we are authentification of the Deadpool is yes in the church and brother Branham says this way foreign is already dead one problem is already dead he's already gone but what he says we must stay on the Lucas just like brother foreign possible religious responsibilities so they only left those from Russia he doesn't tell you something brothers and sisters when the squeeze will begin will be used now in its fullness it is under expectations foreign [Music] was not only just expecting but he was in actions shows if I'm waiting for something if I'm waiting for the Deadpool but do you have the Holy Ghost do you have an experience with God inexperienced person a personal experience with the Lord because I just follow my husband or my father in the message that's all that I've done no no no no no no no no no no you cannot be unexpected salvation is individuals each one of us must have a personal experience the experience of a Pentacles must have it personally remember even the trustee or the teacher even the person each one of us being experience must have a personal experience yeah [Applause] to be standing on the property and to preach to the Bride of Jesus Christ of Jesus Christ without the holy [Music] ghosts that's why he told to the disciples you waited Jerusalem hallelujah hallelujah [Music] brother beloved brother Branham continues he says I ignore what my friends are saying I don't know what it's gonna be like [Music] and I believe it's gonna be something that will help his secretary suffering in these days [Applause] and I told him that I will be uh I will be faithful yes and I will try to be more sincere than I've ever been with the other gift that he gave me because with the first and the second Paul demonstration because of public demonstration he calls impersonations brother Brian I'm someone said what he told me in that little wooden building I will go with faith in the grave Hallelujah that's why when brother Brandon was preaching the surface brother Branham says I'm careful not to say too much because I have to stop here there are certain things he could not say amen amen foreign [Music] and we are there what kind of example do we have fighting one another [Music] and we try to lift up ourselves in this message to be somebody we already have an example for the age our our example you know Jesus Christ is the top model [Applause] greater than what I did with my own Ministry it is the sovereignty of God and since he's our example my friend brother sit [Music] it's a privilege that me and you have Jesus Jesus when he came the farmer he didn't he was not married but we have an example a man that could live like Jesus Christ he has children like me and you what brought the fifth manifestation of the temple upon murder shows he was upon a misunderstanding in the family between a husband and wife say I love my wife so much lazy but in this case this is the word I have to show her the truth yes and she take care of my clothes she's the one between me and the public but when it belongs to the word of God I have to show her the truth we yes between mad and me between mother and Jesus Christ I love Jesus Christ May that also love Jesus more than me this was an example God was giving us [Music] [Music] when it will come the first time to see if it's gonna happen the way he told me if not we will get it and we will bring two sisters together will enter in the room I'm not saying it's going to be one way or the other sister thank you but I just want you to know because because it has been already declared that something new will happen and here we are but yeah you see now so my point tonight is that each one of us say oh my friend oh brother I am glad and I'm telling you the truth I'm happy with my hands up for me to travel I saw in every every obstacle God will move it on my road every trial God keep removing it that's the truth I say how did this happen but how is so perfect how is everything working out and something tells me he or he's already been lift out of History the one that was with Paul the one that was walking with the apostle he's now walking with his brother and then you must be worrying about that being your case so that the Lord will begin to walk with you through there was a pastor that was singing one time walking with you walking with you he said Enoch walk with you Paul walked with you Moses walk with you brother Brian I'm walk with you me also I want to walk with you you don't want to walk with him [Music] someone problem that's my problem prepare yourself because the third pool is coming that's why brother brought them very foundational of brother branham's life and she should be the foundation of each one foreign the foundation of every nation yes my brother so that things can go well in our lives paragraph eight yeah you say I would let you go let me take what is uh so just before we open this blessed o word before he read the word [Music] we shall assure you and the world we shall never say nothing outside of what is in that because that is the foundation foreign to preach today but I want you to know I want you to be to rest assured yeah that I would never and all the secretary never say something beside what is in the scriptures because that is the foundation [Music] yes you might be going to college [Music] your Prophet say we must read our Bible every day that's the foundation of our life you must even study the Bible we yes this is it today we have such an easy job with the voice of God dispatching the message it's easy and take my understanding my my little inspiration I compare it with the message and then I look if I saw something wrong I said my God listening to brother Brandon I would have made a mess himself somewhere [Music] every single day he was preaching this hill he isolated himself he was consecrating himself so I was there in the room and brother Brian I'm saying if I was not there at 11 o'clock in the morning and if the angel didn't come to give me the interpretation of it I would have said other things why do we complicate our life in this message why do we complicate ourselves in this message brother preacher Mr preacher why do you complicate your life it's so simple take the message listen to the message from the beginning to the end You're Gonna Catch the thought of the prophet that's the first thing you do that's the way you're supposed to be I listen to the message first oh I see what brother Branham is trying to say so in this message so he want to say this he want to say this now I begin to study on it and I study on it and keeping the thought of the prophet when I'm studying the Holy Ghost can come and then direct you to another Court and I say yes I remember quote yeah brother random spoke about that in another Court and I take that one again and then when you look you compare the two thoughts it's lining up amen oh my my my why do we complicate ourselves amen the foundation it's the Bible appeared Prophet listen to the prayer brother Branham says this in paragraph nine brother Branham says this is now that we're standing tonight in your presence we are relaxing in our own in our frail frame I'm just uh skipping a little bit he says this he says this hello so at the end of this uh memorable in this uh uh place in commemoration of the first we Revival we held here the Glorious episodes showing us by that great powerful hand from here have swept forth to every nation and around the world [Music] and men and women are being healed of their sickness coming to be acquainted with the true and living God the people begin to know from the ministry of brother Branham hallelujah hallelujah we are a privilege so oh God let this Divine program we ask you in this building [Music] not this one who have stayed behind nature from the fields and has been prayer warriors [Music] [Music] it wasn't foreign because we feel that it is your great Providence to do so thank you Jesus somewhere that's why it was the third pool it's the opening of the word we all know that it's the opening of the word we know that also said foreign and I know what he's doing the opening of the word does something to the people listen to me carefully I'm speaking simple I have so many scripture I can prove it to you the third pool is the opening of the word brother Branham says I know what the third police and I know what the third pool does Amen when brother Branham started the first thing he created Square that's what the third Pope manifested but why is the creation with the opening of the word the same thing there was a scripture brother Branham was not understanding mark 11. 23. that scripture was difficult for brother Branham to get it when brother Branham was hunting he didn't have squel and he heard in his heart if you speak to this mountain he said but this scripture again I don't understand the scripture and I don't even want to preach the scripture because if I preach this is what I would say this is what I won't say but that scripture keep coming back to him Mark 11 23 Mark 11 23. brother brought him say what is going on again and brother Branham begin to meditate on that scripture and the Holy Ghost speak s why do you think that this power was only for the people in the Old Testament before the atonement before the crucifixion first God say let me ask you a few questions let me ask you the prophet in the Old Testament were they speaking by themselves or someone else was speaking do you know he said no no God I said you he was a God who was speaking through them now you everything that you did through your ministry so where did you get that from is it yourself he says no no no God he was not me it was you now I begin to understand what he was trying to say now I see so if a man is so wrapped up [Music] now speak the word and whatever will say will happen that's how brother brother by speaking the word you see my brother there was a scripture and God revealed to him the scripture and he spoke the word yes so easy complicated it's not complicated we complicate so many things I'm not teaching I'm just exerting be hard to walk with God amen right look at Artie right there's no complication what happened brother must testifying he said oh God created as well in February and brother Brian I'm saying easy what is he says I believe that's the sin that happened with Abraham when God gave him the ram yeah that's the scripture background listen foreign [Music] [Applause] you gave it to her amen what can I ask you brother brother the greatest Desire System [Music] I don't remember now my children right there the salvation of my children in the name of Jesus Christ the children receive the Holy Ghost you see my brothers and sisters and I know what he does we cannot do anything say but it will be directed to the unbeliever wrote the show people will see things in your life he was here where is it that is buried you disappear [Applause] he began to disappear oh you see we told you these people you sorcery you see now no they won't believe it [Music] but it won't be a glorious time that is the thing that will give us rapturing faith amen hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to God amen ity that is exactly the truth that is exactly the truth it is [Applause] [Music] why are you under destruction don't be distracted do not be under destruction do not be under destruction oh my God amen ities yes thank you Okay so I believe what we are sharing tonight it will help you I cannot finish this preaching himself moving forward but my time I have to share with my translator so if it's one hour 30 you divide it by two so it's not really one hour third so I cannot finish it amen amen and I believe by the time I wind up you will continue to love me I love you and I love you more amen listen paragraph 29. brother says this now I'm waiting for something to happen to bring the third pole to the aim purpose that it was sent is on the dimash this healing services on Sunday maybe that will produce it you see brother Branham was always under expectation this he was always under expectation you can verify yourself in humble yourself you will see 1963 how brother Bradham explained it amen now listen so since I have few minutes let me summarize on this conclusion I'm going to go straight to the point brother Branham says this is from the beginning he says the general situation that we are now living it's showing us or indicating two things and those two things it's the end of the world history [Music] and the end time so let's be very careful listen to what brother Branham say in paragraph 13. and tonight foreign and we are looking at two sins happening and taking place and these are the sins the first one is the end of world history and the other one is the end of the time great man throughout the ages they're long to see this time that we are approaching now hello and we are living in this glorious time of the sunset and then of the Eternal Light yes and I believe that we are living in the most glorious age that was never given to men it is the end of time and the fusion with eternity history only relate to us what we read about what happened before is the way which will happen in the future is in the hands many records from history because I don't think we will need that we said will bring into at some deep water okay but you cannot stop it only admiring the history of the hero in the Bible what God did in the Bible they wanted to do with you but when we are in the end times [Music] and the last thing that remained for God to fulfill that he said if you believe that this is the gospel thicker and then to the Sea you desire you decide to begin to do that [Music] and be certain of God he said wants something will happen to you if you are sick you can leave tonight here if you're not safe you can be saved tonight it is deity [Applause] it is not a

God is unveiling the Beast he's unfailing what's going on in Russia he's unveiling Putin not to bring you fear but to tell you your hour is coming you need to consecrate your life because your hour is coming your hour of demonstration that second oil that don't pull anointing [Applause] oh my God glory to God what else can I say he said it all he even got into next Sunday sermon already amen even the court we read here it is not a man that was not our brother that was God blending exactly and telling us I'm unfolding the serpent I'm unfolding the Beast I'm unfolding America I'm unfolding everything to show you in Prophecy that it is the blending of the End of Time the end of History we're gonna blend with eternity but before we can go there must be a demonstration we must see God in the fullness of his power by the power of the third pole take whatever is hinder in your life take it away loosen up every weight because God want to use this bread you remember even in Armageddon he's not coming alone we coming back with him amen we're not going from this world defeated we're going for this world Victorious and when we come back we're coming back again in Victory to to to to again have Victory upon the Beast and the false prophet yes because the third power has been reserved for you amen amen we don't have much time left young people we do not have much time left get serious with God get serious with God you don't want to miss this thing you don't want to stay in this world because if you come in this church you don't see me and some other people just know you're gonna face the worst thing that you ever face in the tribulation period amen give God the preeminence amen whatever you can do in your life make sure it doesn't hinder God make sure it doesn't hinder the work of God make sure he doesn't hinder your relationship with God make sure everything come second amen amen it is impossible for you to see what you see the word the opening the third pool is the opening of the word but that opening of the word has something that is doing in you maybe you don't realize it yet but sooner you will find out that even the torch you're speaking are gonna be doing things you're gonna think something and you go somewhere and it happened exactly just the way you were thinking it is no longer you that are doing that by receiving the word you are receiving somebody and the restoration of the word brother Branham say you bring the restoration of the power amen amen God even unveil the devil from martyr and my and Mary he can make you do something that look like it's normal it is religious but if you look at the purpose of that thing is just to take you away from the church away from the question and answer away from your prayer life and once you once whatever God want to do is finish then the devil releases you and when you come back to you miss something all the time you miss something all the time you miss a service you cannot get comfortable now if you get comfortable the crisis is gonna wake you up amen amen amen one of this day we won't have church amen you won't be calling me a home because I'm giving you all the ammunition here amen you won't be calling brother Robert amen you got to take the word that you has been hearing amen and go ahead and use it for yourself so when you still have time as you see the day approaching do not forsake do not stay awake do not be distracted invest the best that you can to suck as much word as you can suck now forget about your friend forget about your friendship forget about the party forget about the the the the the birthday this Sunday forget about all of that you can speak on the phone two hours forget about it you can pray also two hours it depends on what you want to choose because if you don't want to come to church there will come in time when the church is closed they will tell you now you can stay at home and enjoy the tribulation amen amen the only hope is in this word and the more you get deep in the word you will look at everything that is going into the world and you are singing like an antinger it doesn't mean that you don't see it but the God that he that is in you amen you begin to see things in a different way because God took Israel in the order atonement and God preserved their clothing for 40 years a clothing 40 years not a person a clothing and a shoe was protected 40 years so 40 years you have your shoe and nothing happened to the shoe even if a dog touched your shoe the dog cannot eat that specific tree because the shoe was anointed not to be eaten for 40 years what kind of the material work on the chemistry work on the science was behind that [Music] amen amen if the anointing of God can take the molecule of a shoe and what somebody made and preserve it whatever your body and Jesus was not dead yet this was under the old atonement that's why brother Branham say we have opportunity that all of them even Enoch all of them never him the opportunity we have now you remember the court you don't want to stay out we already have the problems you need to make sure you are correct with your life so you can be partaker and enjoy these things amen amen if I don't have money I will just speak you will even create food you have two choices you can create money or you can create a direct food okay let me say this then I close when Jesus was in the wilderness and he fed the multitude did they bring him a fish out of the water did they bring him a fish from the water that Jesus have to clean they bring him a fish that was already out he was cooked when Jesus multiplied the fish did they multiply a raw fish or cooked fish where did he get the spice now you can believe now now your faith is up right now your Faith's going up I know some of you the battery was dead so I have to plug you up now you see you see where did Jesus get the spice do you understand what I'm saying Jesus match even much the fish that was already cooked he can match any chef and I'm gonna say something when he created the wine he's one was better than the wine that Man created they even told him they say wait a minute where was this wine all the time you should have start with this one first this one was sweeter than the other one foreign [Applause] spoken word Tabernacle is not a continuation of a church spoken word Tabernacle is not a church that was built just for to have a message church that was not the way he was to be this church was built for you to prepare for the rapture [Applause] do you follow me there is a package that goes with it it will give you Fellowship it will give you friend it will give you family but that's not really the reason why he was it was specific this church was specific to bring a specific Ministry to open up something until you you are completely I'm a pastor I cannot say you don't know how many people are getting delivered in this church I cannot call you I cannot tell you the name you don't know what is happening to people's life you don't know how deep this word is getting into people and catch something for years and pull that up amen and take it out you don't know what I'm talking about and I cannot tell you but it's happening almost every week I can hear somebody telling me something and I hear the boss telling me something else and when I go I tell the person it was exactly what he didn't tell me I don't I'm not a prophet but that prophetic anointing is already here it's the second only it is not just here it is all over amen so it's not just a church if you go that way you know Miss God I'm saying that so you stay alert this is not just a message Church You're Gonna Miss God because it's impossible for people to be lining up like that amen it is telling you it is not a human being be careful what you say about this church be careful what you come up with be careful the way you behave because many of you has been caught left and right left and right I'm sorry Pastor I'm sorry Pastor you saw it all over you know what I'm talking about I'm not going to call your name it is telling you it doesn't have anything to do with me so be careful amen you're not working for me you're not coming here for me there is somebody who is responsible for this church he is responsible for his bride he's the one doing the work amen I cannot do anything if he doesn't tell me what to do how can I sit and listen and look at Daniel and begin to see this combined with this where can I see that I was reading these books a year I didn't understand them it is not me he have nothing to do with me it is God who's coming at the End of Time the closing of History amen he's trying to deliver you I sit down and I watch your problem just like this and I say the day that person will understand and humble themselves and leave it alone they will be the lever right away but I cannot force you to get there because it's going to be me doing it I have to let God whoop you until you get there brother Brown I made a mistake trying to pray quickly for somebody God said no no no you should have wait for the vision and let the person come by themselves and what about them have to sit until everything goes so sometimes that's why I'm sitting and I see you going up and down going up and then I'm sitting until you fall down boom and say that's it that's what I was waiting for amen we have a word that have an answer to every problem I'm not saying I have something we have the word this word was built to hinder every situation in their life and sometimes the way he works is different he can even cause tension and through that tension comes Deliverance if you get caught in the tension you're wasting your time no the attention have a problem it's going to go tension tent until it's just God trying to break somebody because they're still too strong amen praise God your boss will begin to unfold the things I have to stop because if I continue I will continue to say that amen Amen Brother John 1 2.
