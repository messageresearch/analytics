TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the wise man as you heard in my last message how that God dealt with the wise man and in the day that he he turned him aside by a dream and he told Joseph by a dream how to take care of the welfare of his own son because he had the dream there was a dream is secondarily something off to one side because people can have dreams that's not right but there was no prophet in the land in that day there was no Prophet therefore God had to use what he had to use with and teaches us that that God can use every faculty and everything that we do if it's consecrated to him but it first must be consecrated to him let your your meditations which really reflects your dream see because it's your subconscious if you watch a dream you'll see that's something you've been thinking of or something like that usually you see and let your mind be on God then see so it reflects something for him and whatever you are uh let it reflect him now in the heaven above did you notice I'm looking on this the um the light on the picture there out of the Life magazine that uh the brother lives here in his home has um uh put on his wall uh that triangle uh light I just happened to run across my mind if any of you has the Lums of Bible translation if you'll notice over the cover of it is a tri trinitarian light a three cornered light like a Halo and um when Dr LSA friend my personal friend was translating the Bible that is the old Hebrew symbol of God in the true trinitarian way that he is not three Gods but three manifestations of the same God father Son and Holy Spirit the light is one complete circle of

be on all of this great singing I just sit up here and stand up here and feel like praising the Lord you know but we got greater things to come is that right amen we thank you for the wonderful songs we know our heavenly father is pleased with the songs that we're sing you know it was just an honor to stand here you know um you pray for me right end of the year I'm I'm still always a little shaky when I come up here I got to wait for him to come is that right it's always an honor because you know I'll say this before we um go into the word we didn't have anything there but something was really pressing on my heart what the Holy Spirit had the press the pastor say this morning this a simple thought because you know when you catch a word and it Pricks your heart I'm I'm not worthy to stand here in front of such a precious people you know we say that we saying these things now by Revelation and by God's mercy and Grace to be affiliated with such gems as brother Robert and the pastor brother Steve it's an honor yes sir because it's only by the grace of God he's given us what he's given us in this hour here and placed us where he's placed Us by the foundation before the foundation of the world and as you continue to grow and I say to you young men that's why you keep hearing me say my you need to get into the position yes sir okay came because the Lord he's doing such great things and you know in obedience you rather be obedient and move to the voice of the god to the Lord than rather for the Lord to have to move you in that position is that right remember Jonah Jonah was giving a message and Jonah had to cry out and God give us a message you know and you catch those those those nuggets and it give you an opportunity to go out and help someone else amen you know and you'll see by the grace of God uh just a little thought the Lord put on our heart our hearts and mind are clear yes sir let us pray Lord God we thank you for your grace your mercy we thank you for this opportunity so Lord God bless your people and those had a desire to be here and not able to be here we thank you in Jesus name we pray amen and amen let's go to Psalms and brother Tim he said that but I I'm going with the pastor if I would have known you was here you'll be here huh huh but uh I guess the lot has fell this way here tonight right so we thank the Lord for the opportunity and we're not planning to do a whole lot of preaching just share a little thought with you that was on our hearts Psalms 133 once you have it you can say amen amen hallelujah still here the pages turning you know when I seen our our our sister gift sing that song and right at the end it was a part of that song it said let us come together am and uh so uh that's what we kind of just looking at tonight thought in Psalms 133 it says behold how good and pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell together in unity it is like the precious you may be seated it's like the precious ointment upon the head and rain down upon the beard even Aaron's beard that went down through the skirts of of his garments as the de of Herman and as the de that descended upon the mountains of Zion for there the Lord commanded the blessings even life forever more you know you come and you see we don't fully know what the Lord have for us along the way he just opens things up but he shares with us the honor I mean the honor that we have the position that we have through the ministry that he sense you know the reason why you hear me say these things and I say it humbly and in love because at times you know you still going this way and some of you get that old Parable say you can't teach your old dog new tricks throw that out the window okay throw it on out the window right because God has time he didn't he didn't start dealing with Moses until he was 80 years old right so you know you might as well forget about me getting no I'm not old yet is that right because God still got a word for me is that right he sent me up in a position because he's not finished so I got a pastor that can help teach me and help me along the way is that right because that's what the prophet of God said you just follow him along the way Paul said follow me as I follow Christ because we may see see that's why I said let's come together we may look at things different we may see something that's a little rough maybe we can't put up with but the pastor is looking beyond that is that right because God put him a gift in each and every that gift in him to recognize the sheep that he sent among us so we want to look at just some of the quotes here we just wanted to read tonight by by the grace of God you know here in the message brother Brandon worked it in the power of transformation it was uh 1031 65 if you if you got if you're writing it down he said he was working with out of this just one scripture Psalms 133 he said you know I want to get out the way and eat you know you might can preach a little bit but you like to maybe you can cook something or cook a type of food or chicken whatever but you like when somebody else cook right so I'm I'm going to share this with you then I'm going to get out the way so I can eat let these young ministers come on up here he said now look he said God likes to be worshiped and when you worship Him it just isn't isn't exactly singing a song as as we do but singing it in the spirit of worship he said you see see that's what we got tonight yeah I didn't know go but that's what we got tonight so when you singing you Worship You worshiping him he's pleased he's thank you he's worthy that's what he put us here for right to worship him to praise him give him glory give him honor that's what he said because he's a great God he's a mighty God but God so loved the world is that right not so much we loved him but he loved us hallelujah he said now look you see he said we worship him in Spirit he said then you feel the Holy Spirit bounce back ah he says and I see great big I see great big young men just like today that group of young fellas sitting there young boys see I didn't even know this was here help me Lord he said young boys and their little wife uhoh yes sir yes he said and their little wives uhoh in foreing something huh help me Lord yes my brother yes my brother he said now look uh he said they sitting there with their little wives he said rough men sitting there he said he said big rough men don't know little men sitting there with their wives along with them and big rough men sitting there and just CED like babies that's right he said why look at that today yes sir he said they're out here here on the street living in the doy and filthy the world and things and to think that you can come apart and gather like this amen where as the psalm said behold how sweet and pleasant for Brethren to dwell together in unity amen it's like the anointing the anointing oil that was on Aaron's beard yes sir and that ran to the hyns of his garments remember what the pro remember what the prophet of God said at the end of those garments was pomegranat that's what the Holy Spirit was saying the other day there's no way in his presence you could just sit there no sir there's no way in his presence you just sit there because you know when you in his presence is what it's plenty noise is that right he said when Aaron went them presence in the presence of the Lord those dragans they just started singing a tune is that right making a tune because they was in his presence you are in his presence it's salvation in his presence it's healing in his presence it's Deliverance in his presence it's comfort in his presence Revelation in his presence you're in his presence am he says which that anointing oil you know what the anointing oil done right it Preserve served him to go in the presence of God see he had to be Anointed with that oil before he went into the presence of God Amen and went bre when Brethren can dwell together in unity uhoh you see what he was saying that's why the sister was singing that song I put D up under my feet I put lion up under my feet I put backbiting up under my feet okay I put hypocrisy up under my feet we're moving into a new year we what we're pressing to the mark of the pride of the high calling as Paul said forgetting those things of the past but I press to the for of the mark of the High Calling is that right hallelujah look what he said help me Lord he said you know what the anointing oil done it preserved him to go into the presence of God see he had to be Anointed with that oil before he went into the presence of God and when brother can dwell together in unity is like unto the what that oil see we we then enter into the presence of the Lord with that anointing of Brethren together in unity oil represents what the holy spirit is that right that's what Jesus was saying the spirit of the Lord is upon me and he has anointed me to do what preach the gospel is that right let's look at another one I wrote some more of these um down here God help me I'mma go to uh Lord help me let's say six let's look at 61453 okay if you following me God help me Hallelujah is this is earnestly tending for the faith right I just love my family cuz y'all put up with me I'm learning this thing here I love you huh yes sir Hallelujah you know you got to understand you know when when I first got married and they came out with the computers when they well when the young when the youth start coming in you know they they changed to the we had paper when we started working everything was paper you know so when the youth start coming in they changed to computers is that right when it changed to the computers I had to help the youth had to help me along is that right so I appreciate your prayers is that right hallelujah oh boy my my my my my he said now look 61453 paragraph 60 yes sir he said earnestly contending for the faith I know you think we're all awful noisy Bunch well well brother I can prove oh thank you Lord I can prove to you if there ain't noise noise then there ain't no God there he said listen now this the prophet of God said I can prove that ain't that what he said that's what the Holy Spirit was saying this morning some got the word and just the word is that right some got the word and the spirit is that right huh let me keep going help me Lord I know my time is is is is numed he said now look in the old test when Aaron Anointed with the rose of Sharon and when he had the anointing oil that run down his beard to the to the Hy of his skirt he taken the sacrifice and he went into the Holiness of holies is that right so now you got to remember Saints when you come through that door we're all in his presence is that right then the prophet of God he told us what's that that's the outer Court out there is that right he said come up here he said this is the what the altar when we come up here is that right and he said this is the what the Holiness of holy so we don't voice our opinion from here we give you the word of God from up here we give you the message of the hour and we give you the scriptures is that right I want you to turn and look at something we're talking about look look over here in Hebrews we'll turn back we'll go back to that help me Lord look back to Hebrews uh 13 help me and then we'll see by the grace of God I just give you a few scriptures I didn't have many but we want to just give you uh um some scriptures here to help you along to what we're saying we're talking about walking in unity amen coming in unity under the spirit amen because we're moving forward now the Lord showed us is that right this is only the this is the only Storehouse we don't say it proudly we say it humbly this is the only Storehouse here in other message churches around wherever they're at is that right at the time when brother Brandon quoted that it was only Jeffersonville right now God has spreaded his word all about is that right so we all have to come into the unity of the faith we're not leaving here none of us see they're trying to unify but they not unifying according to the message of the hour we are the ones all the brothers we have have to come and get unified together before we leave here is that right cuz he promised not to lose not a one look what he says here we got what IES say Lord help me Hebrews 13 and one he says what let brotherly what love see continue amen it says be not forgetful to entertain he says be not forgetful to entertain strangers for there some have entertained angels when whereare he said remember them that are in bonds and as and bound with them and them which suffer adversary as being yourself also in the body yes sir he said now now look drop drop down here to uh five let your what conversation be without covetousness and be and be content with such things as what ye have for he have said I will will never what leave thee nor what forsake you see so he says so that we may come May boldly say the Lord is my what Helper and I will not fear what men shall do unto me amen now let me read this other quote so we're talking about now God is showing us now in the unity of Faith under that anointing of the Holy Spirit that's leading and guiding Us in the way that we should go we don't have to fear anything is that right because Christ he came down paid the price for you and I so that we can put the devil up under our feet he said we are casting down the Devil by what by the word of Our Testimony is that right and God told us that word of the testimony is the message of the hour is that right that God have sent in this hour yes sir let us keep going he said now look let's look at uh if you're pulling it up over on your phone let's look at 7 859 Hallelujah that's dedicating he was working with dedicating of the building to the Lord yes sir paragraph 36 he says in this Tabernacle was the high priest Aaron oh my in this Fellowship after entering into it he was anointed right the anointed high priest David said how sweet is it for our Brethren to dwell together in unity amen he said it is liken to the precious anointing oil that they pour on Aaron's head that run all the way down to the hyns of His Garment amen he said now look this anointing all represents the holy spirit amen Aaron was the what the high priest he was the type of Christ that going to come he says and notice that anointing oil had in the perfume of the Rose of Sharon and the lily of of the valley right you see the rose of Sharon that beautiful big red flower who stands in its beauty who represents who Christ is that right and that's what we're here for we're representing Christ God have sent us a fivefold Ministry is that right so he can build us up for the edifying the body of Christ is that right so that we can now for the working of the ministry he's building your character is that right he's building the character that's why we're not just standing there saying you find your position in the body or trying to push you on no once the Holy Spirit and now has anointed you you Justified Sanctified baptism with the Holy Ghost you're moving into adoption now you're supposed to be now getting trained for your position amen the five-fold ministry is building you to go do what you supposed to do is that right you're not coming in there just coming in church going to church that's why some of the young men you know you got to un understand the pastor he get me straight he that's why I'll be saying he know what I mean when I said he'll get on me right okay and then and that's why I said you have to respect the office sometime I treat him like my son I love him like my son I love his wife like my daughter but I still remember he's my pastor you understand so you got to respect that office now when he's talking it's two it's two voices I got to hear I got to hear that Pastor voice and I got to hear God's voice coming out of you understand what we saying so you got to respect we respecting one another so he's building now you just don't come to church go home go to work come to church go home go to work I look at some of you young men come on now you know what you want God to push you along or you want to go get in your CL it and ask God to work with you is that right and find out which way he wants you to go amen huh am I won't mess with the sisters I let the pastor take he do now look because y'all doing good you see what I'm saying those songs that you sang up here tonight huh look at that you're coming together by the leadership of who the holy spirit is that right he's moving you into something before the new year starts is that right God is demonstrating he's testifying he you're a witness of his great work is that right he's the pot of we de Clay is that right he's working the work on us he begin a good work he's going to finish the work he didn't say a bad work he said he begun the good work that's in you he's the one that's going to finish it so no matter what you go through all things are working for the good who them that love the Lord is that right that's why I said sister you got to understand what God put in you you always going to fight uh stay prayed up uh preach the word stay in the word is that right you can have the letter but God has to come and anoint you is that right and when you get out you sing those song the scriptures told us that what that when those song Under The anointing it sakes some free is that right Saul called David is that right d was the anointed vessel to get those demons off of them it's not just singing a song uh when you come in here you prayed up uh you anointed up uh and God put a song on your heart uh somebody we will start singing We you we will start singing like old times uh people getting slain in the worship service people getting saved in the worship service people getting delivered in the worship service is that right if I be lifted up I'll draw all men unto [Applause] me why do he send the singers out first is that he send the singers out first he send them out first why to do what to confuse the enemy is that right shake them up put fear in them is that right that's why God sent them out there first so we got to understand what your position is up here what God has chosen you for God has anointed you for amen hallelujah help me Lord thank you Jesus he said look he said now look the high priest was the type of Christ amen and notice that anointing had in the perfume the rose of Sharon the lily of the valley the rose of the Sharon that were beautiful flower who who stands in its beauty who represents Christ perfume cannot never be bought for can never be brought from this flower until the flower is what crushed that's right brother until the flower is crushed you got to be going through something you got to be tried you got to be tested that's what the Holy Spirit say to us this morning oh death Paul said oh death where is thy sting oh grave where is thy Victory glory be to God why because we have conquered Death Christ conquered death Hell In The Grave is that right we have possessed death is that right only thing death can do is draw us closer back to home back to our dwelling place as all death can do is that right we have no fear God did not give us the spirit of fear but love peace joy and a sound mind is that right I see him coming around in there one thing I always look for if someone say there's a a Believer I look for where's your joy [Applause] huh huh huh because you because you you're what that Lily only way you're going to get the fragrance out of it he said brother Bram said he got to crush it is that right oh Lord my bill is due glory be to God is that right is that didn't need forsake me oh Lord what what did he say Angelo I got a pain in my back I can't move that's all right but glory to the god I can move is that right oh Lord uh my son uh my son is struggling out there but Lord I raised him what according to the way of the Lord uh oh Lord what he say glory be to God uh I still give you praise Lord uh my finances is low Lord God but it crushing me like a lily but I still give you praise Lord bring that sweet fragrance hallel cuz it's Christ down inside of you is that right Christ was tried in test it amen help me Lord glory to God help me Lord yes my brother he said now look that flower can stand in Christ he said perfume can only be brought out of that flower when it's crushed the sweetness can only come out of you is that right when you're tried when you're backed up against the wall is that right when the enemy expect you to kick up and fuss and do something you just stand there sweetly waiting for what uh waiting for the anointing that come down on you brother brandom said when that man about 200 or 300 lbs came up to him is that right and he told him and when that fell came up to him and spit in his face he said this night you're going to fall over my feet is that right but he could have spoke anything is that right but he didn't speak that he remembered the grace he said something came over him he that sweetness came over him to extend Mercy to extend Grace uh to the woman times is getting tough out there it's getting rougher out there people hearts are getting wax gross and hard right now but we got the answer why because God told us the thirsting they're really thirsting for God is that right every human being is thirsting for God they going to see him in our conversation and in our lives is that right let's come together help us Lord sir speaking to one who's speaking with one another in love amen he said now Look perfume can never be bought from this flow unless unless it's crushed uhhuh mashed squeezed out of it perfume to be a sweet smelling savior unto our Lord is that right that's what God sent us here to represent him we got one more God help me now Look at 311 and 60 yes sir hallelujah amen he said Hallelujah I tell you what that let's go to back to the 7 7559 I I I want to look at something God help me he said now now look he said and the great Beautiful Life yes sir that our Lord live uhhuh was instrumental in God's hand we're in God's hand right but it could never be a perfume until he was crushed smed spit on squeez the very life out of him at Calvary right that made the anointing for us uhhuh he says he was the lily of the valley what do you get out of Lies see opium uhhuh what does opium do it sooths pain if you're going through a pain hone Angelo Lord Jesus you said the anointing of opium I need the anointing of opium on my body right now now Lord because you showed us you are the storehouse you said everything is in you father you said father you come in the Vol volume of the book uh in the fullness all our promises are there let me keep going I want my time to run out I want to read this the Opium he said what does the Opium do it soes pain it puts you to sleep in the Dream Land that's exactly what does the Holy Spirit do the Opium of the the Holy Spirit eases every pain not some pain every pain you know what you know why you ever see a fell out there on the streets because y'all didn't grow up on that Concrete Jungle but you see a fell out there on the streets right and he's struggling with that they call the monkey on his back when he got that monkey there on his back what he need he was looking for a shot of heroin is that right and the heroin heroin comes from opium and and when they get around in there and when you see him he just sitting there he finally gets some rest is that right he finally gets some rest is that right but now when you got somebody on the streets see this what you have to deal with guys in the institution when so you can relate to him but when you see a guy that's on the streets and he overdose on that drug is that right you know what they do they they they more sharper they more sharper than some saying that they're Christians if a man got that monkey on his back and them drugs and he find out somebody overdosed on that side of town he get to that side of town as quick as he can you know why he want the best drug that he can get on town he want to get that pain off of him we got the best word the best hour the message Christ back on the scene now we could tell them go out and tell them you want to shout of the old the real opan come unto Christ is that right he can deliver you from all of your problem all of your pain all of your suffering is that right Hallelujah some of y'all don't really understand there about it I know I don't want you to understand about it neither I'm just trying to tell you I'm just trying to tell you what you got to deal with when you dealing with this dealing with that institution with them substance help me Lord he said now look he said take every he says it it uh the minist thank you Jesus then what is the high priest he says no takes the Opium it takes away every tear right it mends every headach amen the lily of the valley then what is the high priest anointing it's for salvation and for healing amen he says and what is it the bright and the moon star that shines forth every light in darkness not some like every night that's why that song is I love that song it's a revelation if you catch it if you catch what he did for us on Calvary you can speak it you put the devil up under your feet you put lion up under your feet put migraine headaches up under your feet uh you get around there is that right you you you you you you put back biting up under your feet you put fear up under your feet why because Christ has given us the Opium is that right the anointing to speak the word let me keep going I don't want to want you to miss this help me Lord help me he said then by the high priest it says they Anointed with what for salvation and healing what is it the bright and The Morning Star shines forth like like in darkness and Abraham had the oath confirmed to him as the little light went be before those dark Horrors and sacrifices the lily of the valley the bright and The Morning Star the rose of Sharon the fair nearest of 10,000 he said now look the minister then that stands in in as a high priest to take the place of Aaron yes sir must be Anointed with Fellowship amen Anointed with what Fellowship huh am Hallelujah see that's why he had confidence with God when you have fellowship with God you building that relationship with God that's right so you can know you that's right okay God already know you so you can know you because you won't know what's there until you tried in tested that's right is that right so that's why we have to understand that Fellowship he had confidence with job because he said the only things reason why those things Came Upon job brother Brandon says because he fear them that's exactly right if he don't fear them see it won't come upon you that's right is that right so he said but he knew Job he had confidence in job cuz he had fellowship with job let me keep going help me Lord he said now look he said the minister must have Fellowship he cannot draw a denomination to burier in the house of God you cannot say this church belongs to the Presbyterian this place belongs to Methodist or the Baptist or the Pentecostals or whatever it must be the open house for every that's been separated from his sins and filled with the spirit and with with the spirit can have the gladness of The Fellowship of the oil of the Lord amen oh what a place to worship amen you see so he's telling us now running all the way down to every denomination to every brother that's born in the spirit freely coming into the house Aaron standing anointed Jesus stands the anointed one amen this evening to fellowship with you with you Church of God am Christ is here he says you telling the other on whoever that's come By the Waters of separation and recognize the blood and been Sanctified and baptized into the body I don't care what brain he said you're Sons and Daughters of God and have a right to Fellowship because you've come through amen he said but the holy spirit will bring you in to Fellowship that's of God Amen let me look at one more by the grace of God I think with 3 1160 I believe it was Hallelujah help me Lord yes he says but this little verse paragraph 26 is in the message Mary Bel but little Mary takes it takes from Nazareth up until the hills of Judea up over that rough pass I guess brother arganbright who traveled that path a few a few weeks ago up over over that Hill into Judea to meet her to meet her cousins to enjoy Fellowship together because God had overshadowed both of them what a privilege see when you are the same like Kindred of the same faith of the same family we can sit there in Fellowship around what around the word of God is that right because we're being brought in under the same message is that right help me Lord he said now he says in the past over the weeks he said they can have Fellowship God had overshadowed both of them he said what a privilege it is for Brethren to dwell together in unity amen it's like the anointing that was on Aaron's bear that run all the way to the hymns of his skirt when people together can agree upon God yes sir still being God Amen huh God still being God now you know God that's why he was sh shing with us this this morning a wonderful message the Holy Spirit brought down is that right he's showing us the authority and hunger you got to first Hunger and thirst after righteousness to what to be filled is that right I'm praying the ones that's not I'm going keep praying and ask God to bring it to my remembrance cuz we can't go nowhere without you is that right huh and then you start hungering and thirsting for it we all get on one mind one Accord we can go he said now look what a privilege it is to Brothers to be come together in unity he said like running down Aaron's beer knowing that God is God he said God is just as great as he ever was and can assemble themselves together and worship God in spirit amen see he's saying spirit it's not just the word in this hour it's the manifestation of the word that's why when you tell your testimonies you tell your testimonies with joy you see God is a God opens doors amen that's why when I come I say those things humbly I know what I'm getting out of the storehouse here is that right then it may it allows me to go on my mission sometimes and sometimes you don't want to it's probably my fault because I don't come and tell the testimonies sometime I be moving I go Minister four times a week and the pastor don't don't know that I'm never telling them no that's why you young men I'll be praying you need to get up and move amen okay amen because the Harvest is plenty right and the labor is a few amen and when I have those meetings a special meeting in the pr in the Lord I Shar a short quick testimony with you and brother Steve they don't know really what God has given me here I cannot go in those institutions with just 99% you see what I'm saying no no no those religious demons will look through you that's what he was saying glory be to God they can't touch this because brother every that 20% was saved for us it filled every crack in Luther it filled every crack in Wesley it filled every crack in Paul's Ministry it filled every crack in the Pentecostals now we're in the bride age uh so no demon can get through this because it's Christ you understand we had a testimony last week talked to a pastor he been out there 40 years he's over prison and one and the Lord we were just riding in he told me to call him I said Lord I called him and when I called him I started talking to the coordinator he said well you need the chapl get the chap I said yes sir so we got the chaplain and after we got the chaplain we got over there he says well you got to get a card he said' do you have your blue card I said yes sir he said well we need you to tr uh we going to have to get you to go to the class here and then he said well if you already got your car let me talk to um um them back to the coordinator and I'll let them know so we just started talking to and just fellowshipped and now if he was in a lineup I could not pick him out I never seen him before but we started talking now he's been the chapl in this C Institution for 40 years he said you know what he said there something I just like about you I'm going to tell him to clear you through I'm talking about it's not just something it was God and if it's God then somebody's in there somebody's in there somebody's child need to be set free and God has given me the word out of the storehouse that's here is that right go get him let me see did my alarm go off oh help me he said now look Hallelujah I just wanted to share that short testimony with I set my alarm I got three minutes he said now look cuz I didn't want to arrest the testimony because you hear so much of the negativity right and when you hear that but then when we bring back that good report and that's what we're bringing we bringing them now a good report because we have to bring them up to the message of the hour they got to get the message of the hour so that's why I said I desire your prayers because when you go in those you're dealing with a lot of religious demons and when you in there and those demons but we had a brother that he got he he he robbed the guy right and he got there he was in Georgia and this young man while he was in there he got his life straight and when he got his life straight he come in there he he he said he was going to go to school he went to school he came out he went to Benedict College in Columbia South Carolina and after we got his his his his uh degree in criminal justice he's now a prosecutor on the on fton County police force and the gentleman that he robbed came unto his inauguration so we're just sharing these testimonies that sometime that's the Avenue God have to send some of them to go that route to get them straightened out that's right so we're saying you're not saying publicizing it but if you let us know privately because we had loved ones that struggled and they have to go that route sometimes but sometimes we can reach them and get a word to them and let them know that the Lord Jesus still loved them and they can set them free and the Lord is able to um fill them with the Holy Spirit and use them while they're in there let me keep going God help me we coming to the end he said now look yes he says uh what at 6311 help me right he says now God still God God is just as great as he ever and can assemble themselves together and worship God God in spirit Mary wanted a fellowship there's no need of going down to the synagogue because they didn't believe she went to somebody that had an experiences like she had and she went there to Fellowship so her way she went to somebody that believed was still just as great as he ever was the only one we can take him to what is the Lord is that right let's go to R Romans 12 and my time is just about up Hallelujah we got Romans 12 and10 help me he says he says be Romans 12:10 be kindly affection one to another amen with brotherly love amen in honor preferring one another amen not slowful that's why you have to understand Saints we come and we come in and I say those things pertaining to brother Robert and the pastor and them don't let the devil mess with your mind saying it's flattery and things in that nature no no no no you don't know what they really go through you don't understand the depths of of of of those things so you just keep them in prayer you know God God built them that way God made them that way but they still need some words of comfort at times am look what he says he says now he said not slowful verse 11 not slowful in what business fervent in what serving serving the what the Lord now you see why some now you now you young fellas see see why I say what I say sometime we was out there working over there one of the young fellas he was standing around like this so when I walked up to him I said sir um I need a job what he said

and tribulation continue instant in what prayer he said Distributing to the necessity of saints giving to what Hospitality blessed them which persecute you see bless them bless and curse not rejoice

all are coming to hear when the word of God say that they shall be all taught of God what we waiting now if we can only stand for a few minutes so we can read the word of God let's go to the book of Zechariah Chapter 14 beginning from the 17th verse to 18th amen amen let me start first by Zechariah Chapter 10 let me first go to chapter 10 verse one if you dare you can say Amen okay can everybody hear me okay ask ye of the Lord reain in the time of the L rain so the Lord shall make bright clouds and give them showers of rain to everyone grass in the field you could you might be seated first you must ask rain from the Lord amen amen if you don't ask for rain you're not going to have it is the rain of his presence amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord now let's go to chapter 14th verse 17 to verse [Music] 18 and it shall be that who so will not come up of all the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the king the Lord of host even upon them shall be no rain no worship no rain and if the family of Egypt go not up and come not th have noain they shall be plague wherewith the Lord will Smite the Heathen that come not up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles may the Lord bless the reading of his word my little tonight is the key to come out of your Wilderness season amen the key to come out your out of your Wilderness season based on the teaching we have been receiving from the pastor and we read in Zechariah 14 the Bible says if there is any family upon the Earth and those family do not go worship the king in Jerusalem God will not send rain upon that family what does he mean really if you don't go up in worship you won't receive the blessing in other word the rain will not fall upon you the rain of Joy the rain of the presence of God will not come upon you amen amen no matter where you are if you find yourself in the midst of the wilderness maybe you are in the season of the Wilderness amen amen but we want to see what is the key and the key according to what we read here it means you must go up to worship God when you going to worship God God is do the bur to send you rain and he will send you shower of rain as you know you are eagles and you know that ego is not afraid of the of the of the Tempest but the ego uses storm to rise a little bit more higher so tonight you must take your biggest issue and to give it to your big God Amen and you will see how God can change the story of your problem how God can change your situation maybe there is a big trouble that you have no matter what the people speculate about it you have a big God and that God is in the midst of us tonight God is not far from you or tonight or this evening before we cross into 2024 I want you to bring God in your suffering God in your problem no matter how much you were deceived amen or disappointed or where you are completely weak where you are completely feble where you are completely humiliated amen amen all of us here we all have a Lazarus and Mary and Mara they took Jesus to the tomb of Lazarus [Music] if only tonight you can also take Jesus Christ to the tomb of your Lazarus God will bring life and Lazarus will come back to life amen amen and Lazarus will resurrect this is what we come to he we want God to send us rain God need to send us when in the [Music] season God inhabited the Praises that's why we [Music] read if there is a family that does not go up to Jerusalem worship and then to bow down before the king God will not send rain upon the family amen amen in other word if a family doesn't go up to worship God God will not send the blessing of rain upon that family amen God will not send the blessing of Joy no matter the place of or the Wilderness you you are going through no matter the situation that you're facing God is more than able if you only start to worship him to praise him and to clapping your hand clap your hand and as you clap in your hand it will it will begin to create vapor he will create an invisible vapor and this is what we're trying to do tonight and we already started with our worship as you are worshiping when the musician were playing here and the whole church was standing there are invisible things that happen that you don't see because when you look at the vapor of rain you don't see the vapor is invisible when you look when God created the sea when he created the rivers and the big sea if you notice the sun will strike the sea and the sun will shed upon the sea and from that water that water will be changed into vapor in the natural invisible the vapor is truly invisible you won't see it and as the VOR goes up it will create a cloud and when a cloud has been form when there is a bunch of clouds that's therefore when God send the rain down and you will notice that it begin to where it's in the wilderness and what is the Wilderness it's a place where it's dry it is an extreme place it could be too hot or it can be too cold that's why if you notice when God took the children of Israel they were first going through the Savanah and God changed the seen that Pillar of Fire that you see on the picture our our picture of family and God gave us a picture in this this is our picture of our family and that Pillar of Fire was playing two parts in the in the on the journey when he was too hot God will change into a cloud amen amen in order to cool down the temp as the people are walking God cannot send you in the wilderness and God cannot provide your way to cool you down and when it was too dark at night he turned into a light amen amen when it's too hot it turn into something cooling down and when it's too it turned into a fire and increase the temperature and they were continuing on their Journey it is God putting you in those trials let me read this where brother Bram speak about it God will never put you in the test alone if there is a trial in your life it is a means that God uses to you up it is a way God uses to bless you this is what the pastor preach when you are hungry it means there is food somewhere when you are thirsty means there is water somewhere but the problem is when the children of God find themselves in such a situation maybe he want to go too maybe he want to get married but he take lightly he doesn't take the desire Ser you don't take God at his word brother instructed us to take God at his word God in his promises let me read something here in the message thirst 1965 in paragraph 118 brother Bram says this when God makes a promise and then comes around and fulfill that promise that is the interpretation of the promise I will dare I will dare anybody to take God at his word and see if every word in that Bible is not the truth EXA that's right that is what that thirst is in there 125 we got a living God not one that died 1900 years ago and stay in the grave amen amen that is in the grave by one that raised again Hebrew 138 he's the same yesterday today and forever the same holy ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost is the same holy ghost that is here now he is that satisfying portion because he is the word that's right the Holy Ghost wrote the word he interprets the word the Bible say in second [Music] P that the Holy Spirit wrote the Bible that man of old moved by the Holy Ghost wrote the Bible amen amen 126 you can do it you can satisfy the holy t with nothing less than God himself living in you I was saying that you could have a needs you a desire to go study or maybe you want to get married but you don't know and what brother is saying is that it's only the Holy Spirit who wrote the Bible he's the only one that can interpret the word only God in other words you have to go back to God when you have a need you must look onto the promises of God what have God spoke about this for my situation for my condition what have God promised about it if there is nothing that God spoke about but you have to speak to that God because we saw certain women in the Bible they were not there when God gave the law to Moses about the inheritance and they told Moses we are women yes that's true but when you and God were giving L we were not there you didn't include us in the plan and you know what Moses went back to God and because God he went to God and told God and he t god that those sisters those women are claiming their right and God have to give Moses something for them so why can't you change certain things the prophet says this brother say if you receive a delivery from the devil that you have not ordered Maybe they come to give you a delivery if it doesn't belong to you you you send it [Applause] back give me more volume my brother blessed be the name of the Lord I went to uh I was looking for a car at the dealership my purpose was just to go ask for the price and when they give me the price and everything then I take the estimate to the bank and the bank will finance it and when I got to the dealer on my way before I even went this is what happened a voice spoke to me that you were asking for a new car so while you are sitting you don't go look for that car you praying but you staying at home you're not going nowhere so after that voice struck me I left home and I went I said you know what let me go towards South Carolina and as I was on my way I saw a sign for a dealership somewhere on the road and I found out that I passed that exit and my heart was at peace I say ah I don't have to go back God was continuing to lead me and as I continue to go I reach a certain point and I saw another dealer and I was looking for Volvo because somebody told me that if you're looking for a Volvo do not go to the Volvo dealer go to another dealer because it's not their car they will give you a car in an affordable price because I went to Charlotte to look for a Volvo an SUV it was a brand new car toward the $80,000 I said no let me go to South Carolina when I get to South Carolina the Holy Ghost leading me toward Toyota I went to Toyota dealer and I and and and as I got the dealership I said I need show Volvo but no SUVs I say this is not what I'm looking for I'm looking not a sedan but an SUV Toyota the Highland and they begin to show me Toyotas all kind of Toyotas SM and I say how much those Toyota costage they say this is zero marage my brother 2024 this is 2024 and it's 48,000 something [Music] I say well Volvo is my wife car okay she's looking for 4 I'm not ready yet so I'm going to Toyota the Highlander so I told the dealer give me the price of the Highlander took time and take me here and there to this office to that office back and forth Drive they say give your driver license I gave them the driver license and in my heart I say I didn't people to ask me all I need is the information why are you asking me my ID and they came back again where do you work how much do you make I gave those information and I say what I need is just the price that's all I'm looking for they come back again with a lot of document I was so tired because it took me so long there they say just here I just took my my pen and I begin don't worry we going to give you the car you qualify just get the car you can just take the car and in my heart I [Music] said I was told before that to have uh to qualify for something you got to get your wife credit and your credit and put them together so you can qualify that what I was taugh before my credit I say but God is my credit I don't know all about this stuff because I remember one day we went with my wife at the bank I say I have been 11 years working with you this never borrow anything from the bank so today I come to ask how much you can loan [Music] me so I was expecting them to get get my information and my wife information and I ask the lady I say can I use my wife she said no no no no just you it's enough I said huh he said you already qualified so that was already in my heart that my credit is where the credit credit God is my getting back to they gave me the car they said just get the car you can go and I was driving my old Highlander I had to get somebody to get him back to South Carolina so we can drive two car back home after after while on Tuesday now my head is Cal I begin to take the documents and read what I was signing I begin to look at the interest I begin to look at everything they add get I was frustrated I said no no no let me go back to my bank and the bank look at me they said why did you we had money here why did you get money there I said you know what let me go back to the I'm going back to the the people say if you already It's Already Done whe they sign or they have to redo my I went back to the dealer and we I call Brother St to when I was discussing with them so the manager that was there came and changed everything so that I don't even deal with them at all what I'm trying to show you is God is able to change a wrong contract but God is able to change it whatever even God you want God to change he can change wherever desert Wilderness you find yourself God can change your situation because God knows about it God knows about it amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord when you start praising him as I was saying when you praise God like we did it tonight when you clapping your hand you have a spiritual Vapor it's an invisible Vapor that you don't see it especially when you are praising God and then you doing your worship from the heart with a sincere heart something is happening spiritually God will never sit quiet in heaven God will come down and he will bring his power down and God will work amen [Music] amen if you go to the book of act I believe act chapter 16 act says act chapter 16 very familiar story about Paul and salus when they got Paul and Saul and salus it's in the book of act verse 25 when they arrested them the devil made a [Applause] mistake when we took Paul and Silas when the devil was whooping them he knew what he was doing when they put feathers upon their feet the devil knew what he was doing amen amen but what was the mistake of the devil when the devil put them in prison he took both of them in the same place that was the mistake two of them in the same church that was the mistake even though their feet were pounded even though the hand were bound the Bible says this they begin to praise they begin to sing they begin to praise the Lord listen to this let me read verse 25 at midnight you already understand midnight it is the darkest time in the this is where you are in your life at your it is the time the most darkest time Paul and Silas begin to pray and sang Praises they were praying and singing praises they were singing what Praises unto God they were not there complaining why are we serving the lord and now we found ourselves in this situation we go all the time to church but only bad things happened to us they were praising and singing unto the Lord they were glorifying the Lord and listen to what happened and the prisoners heard them and suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundation of the prison was shaken were shaken and immediately all the doors were open tonight door that has been closed in your life must be open you have already praised God tonight you already clap your hand tonight so therefore as a result every door must be [Music] open there is a power when you are praising God when you are raising your hand when you are Clapping Your Hand naturally you won't see anything it's just like a vapor of rain when water is going into vapor you don't see so when you praying and when you are praising the Lord when you clap in your hand there is an invisible Vapor of and when he reaches heaven will create a spiritual cloud and that spiritual Cloud will bring your and it will bring the presence of God and that rain of the presence of God will begin to break the shackles will begin to open the doors every door that was locked in your life you will find out that it will be wide open because you are because God is more than able God is able to do it amen amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord amen blessed be the name of the Lord amen glory to God let me read brother BR a little bit he's good in time in the sermon thirst paragraph 183 brother Bram says this if you neglect to read the Bible and to believe the Bible and the Holy Spirit to feed upon that you will die Jesus book in John [Music] 4:3 man shall not leave by bread alone but by every word not just part of it every word am every word the entire word 85 listen you got to take it word by word Jesus say man shall not live by bre man shall live by every word that proceeded out of the mouth man shall live by every that proceed out of the mouth of God did you know that amen amen every word of God must be eaten amen amen and you must look at everything according to the promises of God in the Book of Ruth chapter 2 verse I believe verse 8 you will notice what happened there says this to he says this he said my daughter stay with this field clean in this field do not go elsewhere why because in the Feld of Bo food was guarante salvation was guaranteed marriage of truth was guaranteed everything Ruth needed was guaranteed that's why in this message if you want to worship God if you want to praise God everything is in the message everything is in the message of the if you go somewhere else say oh over there they are teaching me how to pray means that person never believe the message am amen never be a believer of this mess because this message got everything you don't have to go elsewhere everything is in the message the restoration of your soul the resurrection of everything everything lays in the message you must stay in the field of B blessed be the name of the Lord Amen brother Bram says this that you cannot know God by an education of something another experience this is on paragraph 130 you cannot educate this into you you cannot receive it by education it is Born Into You it's something that God gives you amen amen ghost is something that God give you it is even the very person of God it is a portion of God when that portion is in it is more than able to open so let me run quickly with the time let me go to the Book of Matthew I'm going to see something in Matthew if [Music] possible Matthew chapter 8 verse 23 amen the Bible says this this is Jesus when he entered into the ship his disciple followed him amen amen like tonight we got into to the boat which is spoken word Tabernacle because we want to go on the on to the other side we want to move from 2023 to 2024 so you cannot go in this ship with I mean yourself we must cross with Jesus and listen to what [Applause] happened and behold There Rose a great Tempest in the sea in so much that the Sheep was covered with the waves but he was asleep amen amen the disciple got into the ship to cross the sea but Christ was also there and there was a storm that arose and God never stop the storm God is in your life God is in your life my brother amen amen God is with you but God could be sleeping The Tempest that in your life maybe you finding yourself in the wilderness where you are in the season of the wilderness it seems like the more you pray God doesn't answer God is still but God is waiting God want you to wake him up when you wake him up when you don't wake up that God you will continue to be late when you are you might even facing some loss in your life am amen remember those people that were with Paul in the in the in the ship they were Traders when the Tempest came up they begin to take their Capital theirs and begin to throw them so when you don't have a position in you begin to lose things you will begin to cast things into the SE and then you waste time on the blessing that God have ordained for you and the disciple understood they said no no we cannot die we cannot perish like that the master must wake up they say Lord wake up and save us if tonight you can call him God is still present to save you to deliver you am I good few minute that's fine okay amen and Christ getting into the boat the Bible said there was a greatest Tempest That Came Upon them and then they were overtaken by there are people but when Christ is with you in the boat in the sh in your house in your body there could be Tempest that are striking that are coming upon your health upon your finances upon your school upon your school upon your children upon your marriage upon your work there is all kind of Tempest that coming while Christ is sleeping in your family while Christ is in your businesses you will find out that you was time you will be crying because Tempest will bring damages God must wake up in Psalm 68 verse2 God climbs up and his enemy scatter away and his adversary run away in upon his face if God doesn't wake up in your life if God doesn't wake up in your study if God doesn't stand in your family you will go you will undergo damag you will have consequences negative so God must wake up God you must wake him up when you wake him up will take the control of the things God will remove every obstacle in your God will calm your Tempest The Tempest of your health Tempest of your situation God is more than able T if you can only believe God will threaten that threaten your if it's a cancer if it's a prostate God is more than able to do it God is more than able to do to stop it if you can call him upon the the answer amen the answer the answer of how to come out of your season of wilderness of wilderness it's praises and worship it's just to magnify God it is Clapping Your Hands it's glorifying God if nothing goes up nothing will come down if if something goes up what goes up is the it's your if your clapping if your joy when all of that goes up it will bring God down it will bring the blessing of rain it will bring the rain of blessing it will bring the reign of the presence of God God is more than able I have I didn't have time to read other thing but I have to stop Psalm 47 verse2 the Bible says this all ye people clap your hands and then praise the Lord with shout because he create he create invisible when you clap in your hand all those noises all those shouting naturally you don't see anything but it's creating cloud and when the cloud are made the rain will come down and when the rain come down he opened the doors no which door was God is in Jesus name let every door be open let every door be open and may the devil [Music] be I want 224 we going to enter 224 with God we are possessing our joy it's going to be a year oface a year of [Music] of ration of promotion of people being a year of [Music] marriages of people having children God richly bless [Applause] you if you understood this well you should clap your hand more than that because the Clapping of your hand will create spiritual vapor and when spiritual Vapor reaches Heaven he causes rain and when rain come down he open the doors so praise God 2024 a year of Praises a year of worship a year where we clapping our hand where we stamping our feet where we jumping where we dancing worshiping the Lord to create a spiritual rain shower of blessing all the time every day every night day by day give us day by day our shower of blessing Our Daily Bread blessed be the name of the Lord glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah let's stand as we change the order to the Lord's Supper hallu amen amen amen amen amen amen praise God praise God praise God amen amen amen amen amen amen amen a year of unity unity in the families unity in the church unity in the marriages a year of unity a year of great Showers of rain amen am blessed be the name of the Lord we have one hour so let's go into the Lord's Supper amen then if we have time then I got my Praises as we entering 2024 We Ready glory to God let's go to 1 Corinthians chapter 11 thank you Jesus amen when people are whooping and everything brother brandham taught us how to enter the year the right way we enter the year the right way with a service that have speakers and with communion amen amen you remember the quote this morning First Corinthian chapter 11 verse 23 amen amen as the Deacon get ready if you dare you can say amen amen glory to God verse 23 Paul says this amen for I have received of the Lord th which also I delivered unto you that the Lord somebody's already starting praising the Lord amen he ain't time yet the count down have not started yet amen for I have received of the Lord th which also are delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed he did what and when he had given thanks he break it and say take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me so the Lord's Supper is a commandment it is something we have to do and as we doing it we are doing it in remembrance of him because Israel when they were leaving Egypt to start their Exodus God changed their calendar and they enter into a new calendar with the Lord's Supper this is what we're going to do tonight amen amen verse 25 after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had sap saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as of as you drink it in remembrance of me so we got to do it amen for as often as he eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's death until he does what so you are expecting the Lord to come that's why brother brandham say the Lord's Supper is a duty for believer Amen brother uh the the Bible continue Paul he say wherefore whatsoever shall eat whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ in other word this is not just regular food but it's a sacred thing if eating this the wrong way has consequences so eating this the right way must have also positive consequences upon you amen and the Bible says but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning what the Lord's body is the Church of the people amen of the believer for this cause many are what and sickly among you and many do what so if you eat the Lord's supper and worly you can get sick or you can sleep you can die so what about if you eat the Lord supper correctly what will happen to you Hallelujah if you are sick what do we expect if some part of your body is not functioning well what do we think I want you to take this not as a routine as you use used to do it before but you taking this with Faith that whenever I'm taking this I'm expecting my body to be renewed like the eagle because Israel took the natural lamb and they went into the Wilderness and God be to preserve their clothing and their feet were not swelling so if your feet are swelling tell that foot today I'm going to put some in this part I will see how you going to swell again everybody okay the Bible says verse 31 for if you judge yourself we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasten of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore Brethren when you come together to eat do what be patient one with the other and if any man hunger let him eat what that your natural food that ye come not together under what and the rest will are set in order when I as we bowing our head brother Robert if you can open the bread and begin to break it the scripture said to T one another so as they're doing this go ahead and pray on yourself for yourself and check if there is something that probably you forgot you don't know because David say forgive me for presumptuous sins certain time we do things we didn't know that what we done was wrong because we are not probably T yet into it but God knows our heart that's whatever we want to do is to please him we want to partake of this lamb we want to be strong for the Journey of 2024 as each person pray in their own way Heavenly Father Lord we approaching you humbly again tonight you who have given us the opportunity not only to partake of the word spiritually but father we

body that was broken for us that was lacerated Lord father that was bleeding father because in your mind you had this church you had each one of us and because of that you endured the cross and you went all the way until you finish it saying that it was finished in other word everything was completed father may you sanctify this bread may you sanctify this bread Lord May the Praises and the worship and the Clapping of the hand that went up in this place and caus your PR presence to come down May that presence touch this bread may it be not just a bread but father may it be a special bread May the effect of this bread be like you did it for Caleb like you did it for Moses like you did it for Joshua that a 80 years old man could still look strong like a young man because of the Lamb that they partook thank you Father if the old atonement could produce such power how much more the antip how much more the blood of the Lamb Jesus Christ father anointed this let this be a supernatural encounter today that as your children are taking it father May something happen May strength be given to the feble May healing take place in the [Music] body May whatever is not functioning well begin to function Lord May life pulsate to every fabri every cells because we are taken it by faith and father as they uncover the wine symbolizing your blood father Lord may you sanctify and bless this one may you bring a stimulation to our body May a revelation posit this body may this body come down unto The Obedience of your word thank you thank you Father touch give us a special experience tonight we ask you to bless it Lord in the name of Jesus Christ as your children are coming father do something in Jesus precious name Hallelujah brother John if you can help lead

glorious name th will be amen let's take John Chapter 13 we good on time amen amen John Chapter 13 if you dare you can say Amen now verse one before the Feast of the Passover when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart after he he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end and supper being ended the devil having now put in the heart of Judah Iscariot Simon son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father has given all things unto into his hand and that he was come from God and went to God he rise from supper and laid aside His Garment and took a towel and GED himself this is the master amen after that he pour water into a Bas and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the tower wherewith he was GED then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter say unto him Lord dust thou wash my feet sometime we try to be overp spiritual Jesus answered and say unto him what I do that knoweth not now but thou shall know Hereafter Peter say unto him thou shall never wash my feet Jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou has no part with me so it's very important to get your feet wash Simon Peter say unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus say unto him he that is washed needeth not Sav to wash his feet but he is clean everywh and ye are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and has taken his garments and was sat down again he said unto them know ye what I had done to you ye call me who and what and ye say well for so I am and another scripture for deity if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one other's what for I have given you a what that you should do as I have done to you so what we doing by washing one other's feet a sign of humility amen it is a the Commandment of God I have noticed over the year message believer have their kind of washing where they put the feet into the water I'm a pastor so I have to tell you and they just put a hand and do this because you don't want to touch one another's feet if you don't you planning on doing that don't do it because you washing the feet of Jesus normally if Jesus was here you will even fell down to wash his feet but the Jesus the holy spirit is in your brother and your sister so when you're doing that you don't do it to your brother you're doing that as a commandment of God wash one another's feet as a sign of humility unto the Lord whether the feet look pretty to you or not that's not your problem as long as the holy spirit is there that's what you do I seen that that over the year but let not be in this place here let's do what God want us to do and God is looking at your heart and God will bless you because he said he did it as an example and we should do it to one another and appreciate one another the sisters will stay into the sanctuary and the
