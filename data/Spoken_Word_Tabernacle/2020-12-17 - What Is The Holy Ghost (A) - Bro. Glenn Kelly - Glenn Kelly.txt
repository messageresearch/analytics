god for honoring the songs of zion father honor thank you lord god musicians lord jesus we thank you lord god for your presence now father that we can gather up under the roof lord god but now we looking for you to come and rightfully divide your word on tonight we promise giving you the praise the honor and the glory father and we thank you and by faith we bind up any demon force that will try to trouble the hearts and the mind of your precious people and lord god so we give you praise we give you honor we give you glory and by faith we claim it all done in jesus name we pray amen and amen well i asked you to go to uh matthew 5. hallelujah it's an honor to be here in the house of the lord tonight it's always an honor to come before his children we thank the lord for giving us grace to be able to go in this area is nothing new it's something that the prophet had worked with but i kept hearing it in my spirit i believe it's time i said lord i want to be obedient unto you i thank you for a pastor to being obedient and he knows that i tried to give it away but the lord wouldn't let me give this spot away tonight so the lot has failed here tonight so we're looking for great things from him is that right so we want you to go to math you all you have matthew 5 and verse 6 you have to say amen he says blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled you may be seated you know what i've been i kept hearing in my spirit about people who uh uh need more of the holy ghost people needing the holy ghost people need understanding of the holy ghost you know we're going in a different angle area tonight so we need your prayers because i know it may be simple to some of y'all that have the holy ghost but you pray with me for the ones that don't have the holy ghost and for the ones that need a refilling is that right i don't get an opportunity you know since i don't know we're not out on the streets like we used to we're not in the prisons like we used to we're not in a job like we used to but you know this was a dear subject to our prophet and when the prophet ministered this he was down with something that was troubling him down in his soul not even just the other ones but it was his self and his wife because he said him and his wife all that they had just got before one another on the stool and rededicated their lives before he preached this message before he ran this series that he was going to do we're not going to have an opportunity to go through it all but we're going to let him have his way in the way that he wanted to lead us and guide us is that right one thing i believe i tell you i know that this bible is true and i know that the words of the prophet is true and hell and god is opening some things up so some of you just hold on it's not going to be just going way back to when the prophet brought it but we're going to bring it up touch on some things why the holy spirit has your pastor in this area he preached this what he's preaching the prophet prophesied and talked about it back in 1959 so i want you to take your time and be prayerful with us tonight okay we got our time set up here and we ask you we know it'll be a great blessing to you we said here he said no and we got the inspiration from what is the holy ghost remember the prophet said he thought he asked you said what is the holy ghost what is the holy ghost given for how do you know it's for you and how do you know you have it right so we're going in there because in this hour here now so many people are being taught different things out there believing that they had the holy ghost is that right but we know god has sent us a message in this hour so i'm gonna do much reading it's gonna be like a sunday school lesson and have your pencils or your papers or you could turn in the scriptures but we're going to do some reading i don't have the powerpoint here tonight but we got our paper is that right hallelujah he said not upon this place we wish to approach this subject and this was 1959 12 1659 and you know what is astonishing the devil is so in trouble brother steve i did not know it was 12 16 today it was 12 16 59 when he preached it it was 12 16 today so it was no coincidence god is in control why would he preach this around this time of the year he said now look he said well he says think this is an outstanding subject today he said what is the holy spirit what is it and now the reason i have taken this subject in line you cannot come and receive the holy spirit unless you know what it is you cannot receive it if you know what it is unless you believe it's given to you and then and he said and it's for you and then you cannot know whether you got it or not or unless you know what results it brings so if you know what it is and who it is too and what action it brings when it comes then you'll know what we what you've got when you get it see he said now look i'm gonna drop down so y'all bear with me i'm gonna be jumping he says and that's the way with receiving the holy ghost see you've got to know what you are coming for and how to receive it and what it is see if we all come in here on one mind one accord for the same purpose you will have exactly what happened in the book of acts in the day of pentecost you will have your tongues you would have your interpretation of god you will have your prophecy because jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever we're moving into something saints hallelujah what do you say brother kick the devil out you have no room in here this is the church of jesus christ okay we're moving into something in god's time hallelujah it is not anything complicated it's simple but you got to understand the foundation of he said now look the first place the holy spirit has been a promise it's a promise to us is that right he says no we could take ten weeks to skip the edges of this what the holy spirit is but the first thing i want to approach you just excuse me to just an outline hey let me ask him now i want to talk on it as the holy spirit being assigned we're going to as many things it's a seal it's a sign it's a comfort it's the eternal rest it's an advocate it is it's a deliverer it's your assurance it's your protection it's your witness it's the covenant we've been waiting on huh it's the promise we've been waiting on and it's the power of god they've been taking this holy ghost too lightly it's the power of god the devil cannot stand before each and one of you because you are huh your son's in orders of the most high god oh i tell you brother sean was here suddenly and rather sean he was just tapping in when brother steve came up sunday he said he told the court ones that sent him questions he said you need more the holy ghost i said well that's my confirmation he got around in there right and we're there when we was at the family meeting sister was talking about the holy ghost i said oh lord okay lord if you give me grace see you can't go into an area until god gives you grace to go into that area he's the boss he's in charge to write the footsteps of the righteousness it's the only other lord is that right hallelujah he said now look he says i want to talk to the holy spirit being a sign for it is a sign we realize that all promises is given to us by abraham was the father of the promise he said because god gave the promise to abraham and his what seed is that right after him the promise was made to abraham and to his seed is that right and this sign is to a what covenant people is that we gave it to a covenant people that he made an agreement with us is that right so you have people that's live streaming you have people that's coming in as visitors around and sometimes we assume that they know is that right the holy spirit give you grace to go back to an area for even if it's just one soul is that right because when understanding comes confidence comes with confidence come faith come and faith is a revelation is that right that's why in the message being misunderstood he was sharing them and that what they was being misunderstood they didn't recognize the presence of the holy ghost and that's what he that's what he's bringing him into the holy ghost would come and move the way he wants to move did you see the way brother sean started out and when he started out with his message and did you see the holy ghost take another channel he took another turn and he went directly to the gospel is that right somebody needed it hallelujah he said now look genesis 12 hallelujah in here i want you to look here and see what the lord you know if you're writing them down genesis 12 then we're going to go to genesis uh 15. genesis 12 let's look at verse 1 it says and now the lord has said unto abram get thee out of thy coming from thy father's house unto a land that i will show thee he says i will make the great a great nation and i will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and i will bless bless them that bless thee and curse him that curse thee and in thee shall all families of the earth but be blessed oh my god the seeds family christ's family is that right he's down and they thought he said so abram what he was obedient to the word of god and abram departed as as the lord had spoken unto him and lot went with him abram is his 75 years old with he he departed out of heroin let's go to chapter 15. we're going to read the first six verses he says after this things the the things the word of a of the lord came unto abram in a vision saying fear not abraham i am thy what ah look at he's your shield he's your fortune he's your buckler he's that and thy exceeding great rewards and he says and abram said lord god what will thou give me seeing i go childless and the steward of my house is the eliezer of damacus and abram said behold to me thou has given no seed and lo one born in my house is my heir and behold the word of the lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine air but he that shall come forth out of his thy loan own bowels shall thine be thine ass you see israel wasn't going to be there that's why you run across when you're running that islamic spirit they saying they abraham's seed is that right but they're not is that right because what the lord told me that the seeds should not air with the shuck it's right right so it was two seeds in there is that right it was that natural seed even isaac but we were the what we were the royal seed we were the faith seed we were the one that they can't see to see that seed you got to be born again you got to have the holy ghost you gotta have the eyes of god you gotta have the mind of god we're going somewhere tonight you bear with me huh yeah he said now and he bought verse five and he brought him forth brought and said look now toward the heaven and tell the stars it says if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy what seed be is that right and he believed in what in the lord and he what counted it to him for what righteousness what was his righteousness because he believed the lord is that right this is the faith seed this is the royal seed of god it's already put inside of you the holy ghost had brother steve hit it the other week wednesday when he started with with second peter is that right and he started with second peter when he came with second peter and he starts showing it just come to me not in my notes let's turn there real quick hallelujah end time scripture see what the holy ghost is saying i don't want to get ahead of myself i want to walk this so you can see it like it's sunday school lesson tonight he says what it was the second peter the verse chapter one you have to say amen let's look at verse three we go in the very start of verse three he says and according he said and according as his what divine power heavenly power this is not just any power inside of you this is divine power this is the power of god that's working inside of you once you get this holy ghost i'm telling you he's going to work it inside of you he's going to work it through you you look at this scripture here why he told him what add to you what where are we at hallelujah he says an according verse 3 as his divine power have given unto us what all things that pertain to what life eternal life first seek ye the kingdom of god in his righteousness and all these things are being added unto you we're on the move saints you got a power inside of you you don't have to worry about no diseases know the sickness so you're going to get trouble sure god's going to allow things to come on us because we only not in the body change yet you remember sister look what he's doing for your son is that right because you signed and you're crying for the condition of the land [Music] look what he says he says all things returning unto life and what godliness through the knowledge of him that have what called us to what glory and virtue you see whereby you are giving unto us what exceeding and grace and precious what you think that message you think what he's given a pastor is just some coincidence no it's not we're going to get there you keep praying with us we're going to get there we're going to show you great and exceeding precious promises the word that was hidden in the mind of god and god saw you to be favored and he comes in his enzyme and make it known to you they've taken it lightly don't take it lightly what god is doing in this hour oh your mercy and your grace thank you jesus look what he says unto exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be what partaker of the divine nature hallelujah what is the holy ghost he says now look divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this giving all diligence add to your what add to your virtue and to your knowledge after your temperance at two years of what i say patience godliness is that right that to your godliness brotherly kindness to your brotherly kindness charity is that right nothing above the charity but when he started out the prophet of god told us it was two seeds there is that right it's either faith or doubt huh so the word is being added to somebody faith seed or doubt seed is that right if you go to that scripture and you look the seed is already there he's saying you add to your faith when he got in there that's what the holy ghost was working with last wednesday he went to first peter he was talking about this what divine nature is that right look at the promise he said now and for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall never be what barren or unfruitful and what the knowledge of our lord jesus christ hallelujah to give him a clap often he said now look he came in abraham look at his sign he said now i want to talk on it the holy spirit being a sign abraham was the father of the promise because god gave the promise to abraham and his seed the promise was made to abraham in his seed the sign is to a covenant people he says now there is a vast difference between a christian and a holy ghost hill christian let it sink in because that's why some what the prophet tell us he said you could be justified and not sanctified you could be sanctified and not have the holy ghost is that right i think that's first john 5 is it whoever everybody talks about that so he's telling us that's why he says the blood the spirit and the word is the father the spirit and the word is what one is that right those other three what agreeing one is that right but now we're becoming one with the father is that right he talked about the shadow is that right we're going to move away from that shadow he said closer you get to that shadow he says what that hand becomes what it becomes what one keep it so simple so a child can receive it is that right hallelujah look what he said he said now he said he said now there is a vast difference between a christian and a holy ghost-filled christian he says now we're going to get this from the scriptures and the place is just exactly in in the scriptures is that right he said now look said there is a christian professor to be a christian but if this christian has not yet been filled with the holy spirit he's only in what process is that right of becoming a christian so now we're talking about receiving this holy ghost is that right we're talking about your being the seed the abraham seed the faith seed the royal seed of god is that right i tell you what another scripture let's turn to galatians three we're looking at his ear because seeing his hour here now he's narrowing it down i like when the holy spirit had brother steve when he came see playing church is over with you know when the brother is talking about diligently you're talking about now you gotta when the holy spirit waking you up three o'clock or so in the morning you got to get on up and listen to that voice and be obedient to that holy ghost he's moving right now he's training you he's getting you prepared for something how are you going to tell these children about all night prayer how you going to tell these children about being obedient to the holy ghost how are you going to tell these children when the holy ghost wake you up at three o'clock in the morning and you praying until seven o'clock in the morning how are you gonna tell these children if you never went through it if you never experienced it is that right that's why god never left them without a witness is that right joshua knew about moses because joshua went to the mountain with moses he knew about fasting for 40 days and 40 nights he knew those things is that right this is not going to be an intellectual conception of this message you either believe it or you don't believe it and this is not a play it's a war and people are misunderstanding the type of love this is not affiliated love this is the agra they love and god means what he said is that right when joshua came into the land this is joshua ministry joshua's on the scene now josh we didn't play with them demons just let him play with them devil we got a can you preach something in the camp the holy ghost gonna call it out he called a can and his whole family what did he say bring him here send the five full ministry at them up there the war so what's going on we get around in there food is going on in jeffersonville in different places look what the lord is doing hallelujah thank you jesus galatians six and nine let's look at six hallelujah he talked about the abraham covenant the agreement even as abraham believed god and it was accounted to him for what righteousness know ye therefore that thy which are of what faith the same or the what children of abraham that's what peter saw way back then peter was seeing that statute of that perfect man he was seeing the holy ghost working through your life that's why you think the pastor's just saying it just to be saying it cruz just said no no no no no no no no you see a little bird you want to be like a buzzer you want to be like a bird you know what those little birds do every time they want to go fly they go they got to work so hard they got to work so hard to get out there and work come on now we're in eagle food eagles go whoa whoa ah they feasted on the matter for this age they're getting ready huh getting ready just like brother sean was saying the lord came and bring us the word getting us ready for this showdown that's going on right now this thing is moving fast huh huh businessmen make an agreement with catholicism huh this is close at the door ain't no play play maybe that's why god gave me grace you be sure you got that genuine holy ghost in his hour here right now remember what the pastor said we got the family mean he said don't think you're so strong don't sit up in no stone peter thought he was too didn't he peter cast out devils when peter did what huh they healed the sick god they ran the devil off is that right he opened the eyes of the blind probably huh but then when they came back rejoicing rejoicing that the devil was subject to them but what did he tell what jesus tell them he said well rejoice not the devil because the devil is subject to you the devil is supposed to be subject to you the devil is supposed to back off when he sees you but he said rejoice because what book of life that's why he told him rejoice huh your name is in the book it's been signed by the blood the blood of god that was set on calvary and it can't be taken off is that right because the blood of god who came down and redeemed you no angel couldn't just come and get you the god himself had to come down and fulfill the plan of redemption ah that's right sister hallelujah look what he says hallelujah he says now verse 8 and the scripture foreseen that god would justify the heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto abraham saying in thee shall all nations be blessed look where the gospel was being preached way back then to genesis 12. he said so then they which be of what faith are blessed with what faithful abraham glory be to god keep reading he said now look now there's a vast difference he said the first place there's a there's a christian professed to be a christian he says but if this christian has not yet filled with the holy ghost he's only a process he is professed to be believe it he's working to it but god has not yet given him the spirit of the holy ghost he's not yet reached that goal with god that god has recognized it so let me stop and pause there see when god you got to understand judas and then was right there with them brothers is that right performing the sign performing the wonders brother steve we was all over there the tabernacle there together people would walk together but then they're finding out now when it's time to move forward and get the holy ghost judas showed his colors is that right when they got over there now it's time to perform the big the the book of acts judas showed his colors is that right the bible says who has believed our report and to whom are the arm of the lord been revealed to is that right the arm of the lord has been revealed to the one who believed the report is all based upon faith do you believe god can save your soul do you believe god can heal your body do you believe god can deliver you do you believe god is the one that came down and paid the price for you whom had believed that report huh who i believe the power of the all the power of god do you believe god is able to keep the corona from getting on you do you believe that god is able to keep that bullet from your family if you believe god they're able to keep you from your insurance going up do you ever believe god and believe you from your son going to get delivered not if he's going to get delivered he's going to get the letter who have believed our report is that right this is the real walk this is the hour saints this is the hour what is the holy ghost the holy ghost is power isn't that right hallelujah he said you recognize how god he says now see he is professed to be believe the works but god has not yet given him the spirit of the holy ghost he's not yet reached that goal or with god that god has recognized it so we now know the only one know if you have truly repented don't anyone know if you have truly believed god there's nobody but god god's the only one can give you the holy ghost god the only one come let's turn the attendant in ezekiel 36 it comes to me hallelujah when they get around there ezekiel 36 let's look here verse uh let's look at verse 16. you might have to jump around a little bit ezekiel 36 16. he said moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying see son of man when is that when he says when the house of israel dwells in thy own land so they defiled it by their what their own way it says and by their what on doing see god puts everybody on free more will this is a type here we know he's talking about the jews but brother branham went in this when he started talking about being born again and people understand being truly being born again when he got down there in in ezekiel he talked about this let us keep going just pray with me he said now before me as the unclean of the removed woman verse 18 he says wherefore i poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land and for their idols wherewith they had what polluted it he said then i scattered them among the heathen and they were what dispersed through the countries according to their way and according to their doings i judge judge them see that's what happens to us and then now some of us got in our situations because they recognized the devil recognized you wasn't operating according to the word of the lord is that right he know you wasn't doing what you were supposed to do so the devil be spying on us he watches every little example when you come up here that's why i said brother john you listen in brother say don't say discouraged come in

had one purpose they was all up there for what for they'll get that holy ghost is that right to get the holy ghost to finish the work of god is that right hallelujah look what he says ezekiel 20 he says that when they enter into the heathen he says where do they win they profane my holy name when they said to them these are the what the people of the lord and are going forth out of what ah they left the way of the holy ghost they stopped letting the holy ghost leave the church they stopped praying they stopped shaking his face uh and who was the first one to recognize it was the devil is that right the devil was right in there spying and singing now we got an opportunity to take advantage of them now we got an opportunity to get on them but we're going to show you we got an advocate though is that right hallelujah even when you was yet in my sins i still watched over you is that right when you was yet in your sins i watched over you is that right somebody was signing and crying and still praying because he wasn't going to lose what not a one no matter what condition we was in in that world we had to see down inside of us before the foundation of the world look what he says hallelujah he says now he says verse 21 but i have pity on my holy name which the house of israel has profaned among the heathen he said verse 22 therefore say unto the house of israel thus saith the lord god i do not this for your sakes o house of israel but for my holy name's sake see let me say brother steve the family name is that right god is protecting the family name is that right all names

give you a what a new heart first you got to repent some of you new ones out there that's in the field has been streamlining and you have questions and someone have been telling you about you have the holy ghost and about joining churches the way no no god says a man has to repent once that man repents what is it he's got a changed heart he's got a changed mind and he's sorry he's truly sorry for what he's done is that right this is the hour see you know when i should be in the jails and tell them fellas when when they was in there you still have to reap what you sow is that right and so you have some people that literally deserve to be locked up i didn't go in there crazy now out of my life i realized you had some people that deserve to be locked up what kept me is the love that i had for them you see what i'm saying but the love that i have for them and also but i had to let them know that so you can't give a man on his last leg a gray area you understand what i'm saying this is the end time saints i don't know this is there's no more age out to this age the only thing left is what going what what is going home is that right holy spirit showed us that last wednesday is that

thanks for eternal life you give him thanks for your wife thanks for your husband thanks for your children thanks for saving all of thank you for bringing those into having came in yet not if they're going to come in god's going to bring them in is that right hallelujah because what abraham's prayer he did what didn't abraham's prayer get locked in is that right now our prayer is going to get our family members in is that right we're the royal seed of abraham huh referring prayer of a righteous man a veil of much is that right how about that woman huh and her son and she raised them she raised her son to fear god and she knew her son got caught in a social disease is that right if she got that social disease uh brother brandon was on a flight he had a head on back in this moment she stayed up all night praying sighing and crying for the condition of her son but she had what confidence in there what brother polycarp she had confidence in her prayer when she got around in there she brought what she brought the plane down she brought the man of god down and see that right she had a right to bring that word to him is that right and he walked up and he got there and when he got there is that right to our house he said opossum oh lady sitting back up in there in the wood but had a revelation of jesus christ in revelation who she was and he had a revelation as that woman that went to that unjust judge is that right the same revelation she had it all she knew was consistently prayed she aggravated him she got on what offensive prayer she started thanking the lord she started bringing the promises to god god i raised my child according to your word i trained him up as you said god but y'all saw in your word lord jesus he was out in the world and he got caught in a social disease lord god but i heard about your mercy i heard about your grace i i heard about your power i heard that you was a forgiving god i heard and god what did she do she answered god's prayer and brought the prophet of god to them hallelujah come on saint paul saints the same thing is in us in this hour here we're going to start bringing them in we may not can go out there like we used to

deal with the same thing he says and and a stony heart out of your flesh and i will whoa look what god is doing for us and i will give you a heart of what flesh shot and i will put my what spirit within you because now why because it's a reason last time we were here is it not a cause see god just don't do things just to be doing things god just didn't save you just to save you god chose you for this finished work god the holy ghost was given is that right because the eden covenant was break was broken so he remade the abraham covenant is that right so he had to send a plan of redemption and a plan of redemption now he's chosen you and i in the age of laodicea is that right so in that in that covenant they lost their fellowship with god but god sent the holy ghost in his hour now for what so that we can become one with him is that right so we can have that power in prayer is that right so we can finish what the redemptive plan is that right so he can have fellowship again because
