[25:56] amen
[25:58] amen amen and we also want to say
[26:02] brother Robert happy birthday to

[26:09] amen amen
[26:14] amen we've got um two testimonies
[26:18] tonight
[26:19] from sister zadi and then sister
[26:23] Rosemary then after that we're going to
[26:25] call brother Michael Mar to to um bring
[26:28] before the Lord our prayer request and
[26:31] praise report tonight amen so we invite
[26:35] sister zadi
[26:48] amen God bless you
[26:52] okay um I just want to say um I want to
[26:56] give thanks to the Lord uh for so much
[26:58] that he's been doing um in my life uh
[27:01] but this specific testimony goes along
[27:02] with the testimony that I gave um
[27:06] roughly a month ago or or so um the job
[27:10] that I received that I told you guys
[27:12] about um you know I really believe that
[27:14] was the hand of the Lord providing at
[27:16] the perfect time and you know finances
[27:18] everybody knows how that goes and you
[27:20] know things were getting rough and the
[27:21] Lord just supernaturally provided that
[27:24] job but there was a lot of things that
[27:26] happen with the time that I um have been
[27:29] working there so I just completed my
[27:31] training yesterday uh it was six weeks
[27:33] of uh pure material um I felt like I was
[27:37] in college course at a AP class in
[27:40] college a lot of it was a lot of
[27:43] information to take in you know a lot of
[27:44] tests and quizzes and things that God
[27:46] gave me the strength and Grace to make
[27:48] it through um but the most significant
[27:51] part is this so I have to smile real
[27:53] hard because I said there's no way I
[27:55] could get this testimony because it had
[27:56] nothing to do with me
[27:58] so um of course there's going to be a
[28:00] test for any you know moving up to the
[28:02] next level of any job so there was a 100
[28:05] question test that was supposed to be
[28:06] taken and then there was also a role
[28:08] play test and then there was um uh
[28:10] something called a nap class which
[28:12] basically was um a face to-face training
[28:14] with a group right so the first the the
[28:18] the nap class was supposed to be my
[28:19] second week of training um and somehow I
[28:22] kind of got out of it by things didn't
[28:25] seem you know correct to me of how I had
[28:28] to kind of put out money to to go to
[28:30] this training usually a job will pay for
[28:31] training so I told my manager I said I
[28:33] don't feel like that's appropriate for
[28:35] me to do especially me coming to a job I
[28:36] think they should be compensating me for
[28:38] the time and you know traveling things
[28:40] like that um and so they you know told
[28:43] me I didn't have to go that and I could
[28:44] go to the next class so the next class
[28:47] came around and when the next class came
[28:49] um I got no notifications about about
[28:51] the class coming up and it was actually
[28:52] in Atlanta the first one was in Raleigh
[28:54] and I would have to travel using my car
[28:56] my gas my time and so um with that uh
[29:00] what happened is when we when I went I
[29:03] actually went to a location um to where
[29:05] the training was originally supposed to
[29:07] be and what they would do at the last
[29:08] minute they would change it to um to
[29:11] wherever the most new hires were so when
[29:14] I went to the training I was the first
[29:15] one there at nine o'clock in the morning
[29:16] training was supposed to be at 10: I sat
[29:18] there for 45 minutes and I found out
[29:21] that uh that basically um to make a long
[29:24] story short that they exempt me from the
[29:26] class so that's the first one the second
[29:28] one is that that they um we the written
[29:31] exam I was supposed to take it on Monday
[29:33] to be able to close out my training so
[29:35] we're waiting for the test to show up on
[29:37] Friday my manager tells I'm sorry
[29:39] Thursday she tells me to kind of you
[29:40] know contact the it to get you know get
[29:42] everything going so we think we solve it
[29:44] on Monday comes we're looking for the
[29:46] test we can't find the exam because they
[29:47] switched over to a new system so you
[29:49] know how the Bible says first shall be
[29:51] last and the last shall be first I was
[29:53] the last one in the group but basically
[29:55] I was the first one to get out to get
[29:56] straight to to to training while
[29:58] everybody else was being trained so um
[30:01] basically I didn't have to take the 100
[30:03] question exam I got exempt from that so
[30:05] I want to praise the Lord for that and
[30:06] then lastly I'm supposed to do the role
[30:08] play test which is basically doing a Act
[30:12] of what you're supposed to do when
[30:13] you're selling and um it was supposed to
[30:15] be yesterday and I got Exempted from it
[30:17] yesterday so then I get to my new
[30:19] location today ready got approved for
[30:21] commission um which wasn't supposed to
[30:24] happen it that also was so it's four
[30:26] parts and when I got there today uh the
[30:29] big guy the manager came and did the
[30:31] role play and that one I thought I was
[30:33] exempt from so I was going to give a
[30:35] testimony that was from three tests but
[30:36] that one I had to do but I missed it by
[30:38] one point and he pushed me through so I
[30:41] just want to give glory to God for
[30:42] making a way all the way through that
[30:44] because I know it had nothing to do with
[30:45] me and so I'm so excited and I just pray
[30:47] that I'll be a light in that in that um
[30:49] that job and I'm just appreciative of
[30:51] everything he's doing so I want to
[30:53] give amen and amen amen we're going to
[30:57] invite sister Rosemary
[30:59] amen amen then after that brother
[31:02] Michael will bring before the Lord our
[31:04] prayer request and praise report and
[31:07] then we have one special tonight
[31:13] amen God bless you Saints I um I guess
[31:17] today was a educational
[31:21] testimonies so so I I had asked foray my
[31:26] husband prayers for me to go do a test
[31:30] and uh this was a a specialty
[31:34] certification test and where I'm working
[31:37] took me five years to decide that I was
[31:39] going to take it and so uh two months
[31:43] ago two people younger than me failed
[31:46] the exam two weeks before I did mine
[31:49] somebody else did it and failed so when
[31:52] I heard that I said Lord it's in your
[31:55] hands I'm going to do my part like you
[31:57] expect me to do and I would I'm
[32:00] expecting you to do your part amen so
[32:03] going to the uh it's a three hour exam
[32:06] and I'm a slow reader just you know
[32:09] being brought up from home we we not
[32:11] trained to read as fast as the people
[32:13] here so I read slowly so I knew I had to
[32:16] really do something for me to finish all
[32:18] the exams the the tests I mean the
[32:22] questions so I'm doing the questions and
[32:24] I'm like Lord you have to take this will
[32:27] because what I read is not what I'm
[32:29] seeing and and so I go on and I look up
[32:33] there's a you know a signal and I look
[32:35] up and I see like you have 30 minutes
[32:38] and I still have 40 questions to
[32:41] go I did not the Lord just held me I
[32:44] didn't panic I just say lord it's in
[32:47] your hands for your own glory and to
[32:51] make a difference that I'm your child
[32:53] and I'm believing in you you just have
[32:55] to take control all of this so I
[32:58] continued on I finished with 1 minute
[33:02] and 30 seconds
[33:04] left so but because of the way the
[33:08] questions were abroad even something
[33:10] that you know it's twisted to a point
[33:12] where you just feel like I'm not sure
[33:14] anymore so I said well it's I I leave it
[33:17] to you so I go out and I thought
[33:20] honestly to God I thought I had failed
[33:23] that exam I mean honestly it was I felt
[33:26] like I passed because the Lord just
[33:29] changed my answers and and that's what I
[33:32] believe and that's why I'm giving him
[33:35] all the glory so I I get out of the
[33:39] building and immediately I step outside
[33:43] like just step out of the building and I
[33:46] get my phone you know um shows a signal
[33:50] that I have an email and when I look

[55:23] and he'll come and have his
[55:27] way okay we got uh Second Timothy
[55:31] 3 and let's look at verse
[55:34] 16 once you have it say
[55:36] Amen see page is still turning we l on
[55:40] you
[55:43] we second Timothy
[55:48] 3:16
[55:50] Hallelujah it says all
[55:53] scriptures see not some all
[55:57] scriptures is written by the
[56:00] inspiration huh of who of God is that
[56:05] right so now we by the inspiration of
[56:08] God and it is profitable for Doctrine
[56:12] that's right for reproof that's right
[56:15] for correction that's right for
[56:17] instructions in
[56:20] righteousness now look what it'll do if
[56:22] you follow this now that man of God may
[56:26] be perfect thoroughly furnished unto
[56:30] what all good works may the Lord add a
[56:33] blessing to the reading of his word and
[56:36] then we're going to go to um let's go to
[56:39] Romans
[56:41] 10 we'll read this scripture here Romans
[56:45] 10 and then
[56:47] we'll elaborate on some things and see
[56:50] which way the Lord want wants to go here
[56:53] on tonight
[56:55] because we're looking Saints in this
[56:57] hour here now is it's getting close
[57:00] going home time is that right so let's
[57:04] look at
[57:05] uh verse
[57:08] 17 once you have it say Amen Romans
[57:12] 10:17 it says so then Faith cometh by
[57:16] what hearing hearing the
[57:18] what the word by the word of God now may
[57:23] the Lord add a blessing to the reading
[57:24] of his word see it says faith come by
[57:28] hearing amen hearing the what the word
[57:31] of God okay so faith we talking about
[57:35] inspiration so Faith actually comes from
[57:38] hearing from God is that right it's not
[57:41] just them because the intellectual man
[57:44] can read the word is that right they can
[57:46] read the word but the scripture says now
[57:49] I'm telling you I got the inspiration
[57:52] from when the little girl was over there
[57:54] right right with naming is that right
[57:57] when a little girl there and that quote
[58:00] that when brother brandom said what she
[58:02] did she caught the
[58:05] atmosphere is that right in the
[58:08] inspiration when you're under the
[58:11] inspiration in your position where
[58:13] you're supposed to be at the right time
[58:17] you'll catch the unction you'll catch
[58:20] the anointing you'll catch what the holy
[58:22] spirit is actually saying to you
[58:27] you huh we're talking about on
[58:32] tonight our topic is all scriptures is
[58:36] given by
[58:38] inspiration and cannot be
[58:41] broken if God said it it will come to
[58:45] pass is that right so we have to
[58:49] understand that each time that's why all
[58:52] the promises is yay to the bride is is
[58:54] that right because the promises of God
[58:57] what he promised you is your inspiration
[59:01] because God said it to you is going to
[59:04] happen in God's time is that right amen
[59:08] oh Satan you in trouble you're running
[59:11] up against the wrong child of God now
[59:14] you coming up against the Bride of Jesus
[59:18] Christ
[59:20] amen religion versus salvation religion
[59:24] versus salvation he's got Christ on the
[59:27] scene
[59:29] huh we got the inspiration amen come on
[59:33] Saints you know you got to understand
[59:36] you can be
[59:37] anointed you can be there uh what God
[59:41] called you to
[59:42] do but you could be out of
[59:45] position and when you get out of the
[59:49] position huh things won't happen won't
[59:52] happen the way God planned
[59:55] it to
[59:57] happen remember David wasn't David the
[1:00:01] king then David want to build God a a
[1:00:04] house for the ark he said that oh Lord
[1:00:08] you dwelling in tents uh but why can't
[1:00:12] we build you a house and David went on
[1:00:15] right he was inspired he was under the
[1:00:19] inspiration but he was not in his office
[1:00:23] is that right na was in the land at the
[1:00:26] time he was supposed to consult Nathan
[1:00:29] is that right we got the scriptures the
[1:00:33] enemy says back to the Bible we never
[1:00:36] left the Bible because the scripture
[1:00:39] says uh you wor seek the prophet is that
[1:00:43] right for your day uh especially on what
[1:00:48] what the hidden things are the hidden
[1:00:51] things only had to be revealed to to a
[1:00:56] prophet oh Hallelujah have your way Lord
[1:01:00] all scriptures that are INSP they are
[1:01:03] inspired by God is that right God said
[1:01:07] he do nothing unless he reveal it first
[1:01:10] to his servant the prophet is that right
[1:01:13] so remember you can be anointed and out
[1:01:16] of your position and but if you out of
[1:01:19] your position now you got to understand
[1:01:22] right you got some when you get out of
[1:01:25] that position then the devil I'mma get
[1:01:29] back to the scriptures we just throwing
[1:01:30] it out right now so the devil he'll come
[1:01:34] to you and when he'll come to you the
[1:01:37] one that know that he knows who God is
[1:01:40] dealing with so what he's trying to do
[1:01:44] is get you out of your position that's
[1:01:47] right so we can get you then he can
[1:01:50] confuse you is that right then he wants
[1:01:53] you to reason with them is that right
[1:01:56] but we're all part of this body no big
[1:01:59] eyes no little yous is that right see I
[1:02:02] can't take the pastor's spot and the
[1:02:04] pastor can't take my spot I'm looking
[1:02:07] for some of these young men to rise up
[1:02:09] is that right rise up so the Lord can
[1:02:12] use you God is in the camp you are not
[1:02:15] going to fail is that right God has
[1:02:18] given us a promise in these last
[1:02:23] days let me look let us look at this
[1:02:26] here by the grace of God sir look at
[1:02:29] that scripture here we'll go back to it
[1:02:32] second Timothy 3 he said look what he
[1:02:35] says and you got four things here he
[1:02:40] said the
[1:02:42] lord well thank you Jesus he said all
[1:02:46] scriptures given in Inspiration by
[1:02:48] inspiration of God yes sir she's
[1:02:51] profitable okay I'm not going to go in
[1:02:54] there we just just going to work with um
[1:02:56] inspiration by the grace of God that
[1:02:58] scripture is loaded in there maybe one
[1:03:00] of these ministers or somebody in here
[1:03:02] to picked it up right I'm just up here
[1:03:04] I'm not much of a Preacher I'm just a
[1:03:06] spirit tire on the night is that right
[1:03:09] huh look at what we said here but the
[1:03:12] spirit TI can get anointed and carry you
[1:03:14] where he need to
[1:03:17] go let's see what he say now he say look
[1:03:21] he said is is for what profitable that
[1:03:24] mean if you accept the word you accept
[1:03:27] the scripture you will always be at an
[1:03:30] advantage and not a
[1:03:36] disadvantage somewhere you rejecting the
[1:03:38] word huh there's no way we should be
[1:03:42] lacking anything in this hour here now
[1:03:45] ah he said now look he tell us now imp
[1:03:49] impr profitable For What doctrine is
[1:03:52] that right he's G given you the doctrine
[1:03:55] he said I will bring you in this age
[1:03:57] only the former rain and the latter rain
[1:04:01] is that right we will have the teaching
[1:04:03] rign that it has to come to do what to
[1:04:06] resurrect as the Holy Spirit showed us
[1:04:09] on the board down in the ground is the
[1:04:12] seede is that right that seed is hidden
[1:04:16] so now you got to come with the teaching
[1:04:19] rain and then you have what the
[1:04:21] ministers that come through is to pick
[1:04:24] up what the teacher done laid down for
[1:04:27] the people is that right because it's
[1:04:30] two different anointings on there is
[1:04:32] that right when the spirit of the Lord
[1:04:34] come is that right let me keep going so
[1:04:37] we come there and as prophit for reproof
[1:04:39] offer also if you take the inspired
[1:04:44] word said then it will bring you to a
[1:04:47] proof you will be able to stand withand
[1:04:50] any test or anything that comes up
[1:04:52] against you is that right it's for
[1:04:56] correction that he's brought in his hour
[1:04:58] here
[1:05:01] now but what we want to look at is here
[1:05:05] the
[1:05:06] inspiration
[1:05:08] inspiration that's a
[1:05:10] Divine
[1:05:13] influence because the scripture says
[1:05:16] it's from
[1:05:19] God so when you come
[1:05:22] here guess yall get a little overtime I
[1:05:25] didn't start my timer

[1:05:32] huh
[1:05:34] hallelujah thank you
[1:05:36] Lord he said now we're going to look at
[1:05:39] down the way but it's different
[1:05:42] Inspirations is that right so you can
[1:05:46] once you get in your
[1:05:48] position I'm trying to interpret I'm
[1:05:50] trying to move slow he's trying if you
[1:05:52] get in your position
[1:05:55] then God can use you what he actually
[1:05:58] called you to
[1:06:00] do but so we let's look at job here he

[1:06:21] understand huh he only could attack his
[1:06:23] wife his flesh right but he came up to
[1:06:27] God and God had already identified to
[1:06:31] him about
[1:06:33] job is that right he was a perfect and a
[1:06:38] upright man is that right it was no man
[1:06:42] like him on the earth so Satan God knew
[1:06:46] what he put inside of Satan I mean in
[1:06:49] job is that right he know you are the
[1:06:52] Bride of Jesus Christ is that right is

[1:32:38] God have your way Lord look what he told
[1:32:41] us he said now we're talking about
[1:32:44] Abraham let's look at Abraham here
[1:32:47] Genesis Abraham God promised something
[1:32:50] to Abraham the Lord was sharing that
[1:32:52] with us right out of Genesis 16 then he
[1:32:55] went to Genesis 21 and when he said he
[1:32:58] going to promis he was going to have a
[1:32:59] child is that right when he promised he
[1:33:01] was going to have a child and he was
[1:33:03] going to have that child there and
[1:33:05] Abraham when he got over when he got
[1:33:08] there and it was time to we do a
[1:33:10] sacrifice a sacrifice Isaac is that
[1:33:13] right when he was there about to
[1:33:15] sacrifice Isaac then what he did it was
[1:33:17] an inspiration that came on Abraham is
[1:33:21] that right when the inspiration came to
[1:33:24] Abraham Abraham said y'all wait here the
[1:33:28] lad and I shall what shall return is
[1:33:31] that right is the inspiration of God
[1:33:34] Came Upon Abraham and Abraham did what
[1:33:37] spoke it is that right Hallelujah let's
[1:33:40] give him a clap off help me
[1:33:48] Lord hallelujah he came amen let me look
[1:33:52] at these here help me
[1:33:54] Lord help me Hallelujah some of these
[1:33:58] Inspirations let's look here by the
[1:34:01] grace of God I tell you what we had here
[1:34:03] help us
[1:34:07] Lord thank you Lord we look at here
[1:34:11] let's look at Simeon we know that Simeon
[1:34:13] right he had a promise he had was
[1:34:16] revealed to him to God by God and that
[1:34:19] what he was not going to die die until
[1:34:22] he saw what saw the Christ is that right
[1:34:26] he was looking for a confirmation he
[1:34:28] wanted the Comfort he want to make sure
[1:34:30] that Israel would be all right is that
[1:34:33] right once he came in in he know Israel
[1:34:36] to be all right uh so God promised him
[1:34:39] by the what by the Holy Ghost it was
[1:34:41] revealed to him by the Holy Ghost Saints
[1:34:44] you got to understand when something is
[1:34:46] revealed to you by the Holy Ghost uh you
[1:34:49] can hold on to it you can hold and beted
[1:34:52] it it's going to come to pass uh in that
[1:34:55] time uh you know your heart is clear you
[1:34:58] know you got confidence with God is that
[1:35:00] right come on Saints you can hold on to
[1:35:03] that promise of God he God said it God
[1:35:06] told Simeon he didn't have to worry
[1:35:08] about anything why he probably thought
[1:35:10] Simeon was crazy he thought he was old
[1:35:12] man and he was getting old there but he
[1:35:15] had a promise he had a promise from God
[1:35:17] is that right and the promise that he
[1:35:19] had from God that he was not going die
[1:35:21] until he saw the consolation is that
[1:35:24] right what are you waiting on Saints uh
[1:35:27] whatever you promise uh if it's your
[1:35:29] father if it's your mother if it's your
[1:35:32] sister if it's your brother if you hold
[1:35:35] him up under the altar you held them up
[1:35:37] under the blood uh you don't have to
[1:35:39] worry about if it's your son uh if it's
[1:35:41] your daughter uh you just keep claiming
[1:35:44] it Saints uh it's going to happen is
[1:35:47] that right you know last time we is all
[1:35:49] under inspiration is that right if God
[1:35:52] said it I believe it you stand on it
[1:35:55] it's going to come to pass Saints but
[1:35:57] you got to understand though God told
[1:36:00] him he made a promise and the promise
[1:36:02] that he made to Abraham what did he say
[1:36:05] uh Abraham knew is that right that he
[1:36:07] couldn't he couldn't persecute Isaac is
[1:36:10] that right he could not persecute Isaac
[1:36:13] because uh God made a promise to him in
[1:36:16] Genesis 21 is that right you should have
[1:36:19] a seed uh you had to bring a seed forth
[1:36:22] uh what he say Pastor he had to pick it
[1:36:24] up is that right then he looked at uh he
[1:36:27] said father I see the wood uh and I see
[1:36:31] that sacrifice but where is that
[1:36:33] sacrifice is that right uh what did the
[1:36:36] Holy Spirit tell us Abraham he spoke at
[1:36:39] he said the lamb and I I mean Isaac and
[1:36:43] I are going to do what Worship the Lord
[1:36:47] uh now he knew the order of God is that
[1:36:51] right
[1:36:51] so it had to be a sacrifice Saints it
[1:36:54] had to be a sacrifice so Isaac knew
[1:36:58] where is the sacrifice is that right so
[1:37:01] he said in his our here now he says God
[1:37:04] himself will do what provide what the
[1:37:08] sacrifice is that right come on Saints
[1:37:11] uh Abraham knew his position with God uh
[1:37:15] he was able to put God on the spot uh he
[1:37:18] was able to bring God down uh you tell
[1:37:21] him father my mother need to be saved uh
[1:37:25] my father need to be saved uh my sister
[1:37:28] need to be saved uh my son need to be
[1:37:30] saved uh my daughter need to be saved uh
[1:37:34] father I've been obedient to your word
[1:37:37] uh father I'm looking for you to bring
[1:37:40] it to pass have your way Lord uh Abraham
[1:37:44] brought God down uh and became a
[1:37:47] sacrifice
[1:37:50] Hallelujah
[1:37:55] hallelujah look what he says we know in
[1:37:58] this hour it's real saints this word
[1:38:01] that is come why because God said in Leo
[1:38:05] the SE a church age he said I would do
[1:38:08] what I he was going to turn the hearts
[1:38:10] of the fathers to the children is that
[1:38:13] right he had to come so that he could do
[1:38:15] what open those seals and once those
[1:38:18] open those seals what it had to come to
[1:38:21] reveal what those Thunders that was
[1:38:24] hidden in those seals is that right so
[1:38:27] we had to know that is what's going to
[1:38:29] give us the rapturing faith that we need
[1:38:32] to get out of here because it was a
[1:38:35] hidden Mystery is that right a mystery
[1:38:38] is a hidden scriptural Truth uh that God
[1:38:42] didn't hide from us God hid it for us uh
[1:38:45] you're in the right place right now now
[1:38:48] he's getting us ready Saints uh just
[1:38:51] hold your loved ones up in prayer God
[1:38:54] was able to perform the Bible said
[1:38:57] Abraham staggered not at the promise of
[1:39:00] God but he grew strong in faith right
[1:39:03] holding on to the promises of God he was
[1:39:06] inspired right by the promises of God he
[1:39:10] was under the inspiration of God
[1:39:13] uh
[1:39:15] Hallelujah help me Lord look what we got
[1:39:19] help me Lord he said look we come down
[1:39:21] here now we go down there look at
[1:39:24] Michelangelo we talked about him right
[1:39:26] we got over there Michelangelo when the
[1:39:29] fellow got there and he had a sculpture
[1:39:31] come on now when he got it a sculpture
[1:39:34] and in that sculpture we know what
[1:39:36] brother brandham said he put his heart
[1:39:38] he put his mind he put his soul in it
[1:39:40] but you know uh where there's no vision
[1:39:43] the people what will perish is that
[1:39:46] right but we got a vision what is a
[1:39:48] vision a vision is a revelation where
[1:39:51] the revelation of the word is uh God
[1:39:54] promis to take you out of here and get
[1:39:57] you ready right by the revealing of the
[1:39:59] word uh so he turned around and he said
[1:40:02] Peter who do men say that I am under the
[1:40:05] inspiration of God uh who do men say
[1:40:08] that I am uh them say you Elijah some
[1:40:12] say you John the Baptist some say you
[1:40:14] one of the prophets but one thing they
[1:40:16] know is that right God says surely I
[1:40:19] will do nothing unless I first reveal it
[1:40:22] to my servant the prophet so he said who
[1:40:25] do men say that I am he said thou he
[1:40:28] said Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[1:40:31] Living God uh he said Peter Peter spoke
[1:40:34] it under their inspiration like that
[1:40:37] little girl uh caught the atmosphere uh
[1:40:40] she caught the mind of God uh he Peter
[1:40:43] caught the mind of God uh he said Upon
[1:40:46] This Rock uh I'll build my church uh and
[1:40:49] the Gates of Hell shall not PR riled
[1:40:51] against it he said Peter is that right
[1:40:54] Flesh and Blood uh this was not revealed
[1:40:57] to you what you're getting what the
[1:40:59] pastor's ministering flesh and blood
[1:41:02] cannot reveal it unto you is that right
[1:41:05] it was revealed from my Father which is
[1:41:07] in heaven he said Peter because you got
[1:41:10] the Revelation he said Peter Upon This
[1:41:14] Rock I'll build my church uh and the
[1:41:16] gates of hell should not Prevail against
[1:41:18] it Peter I'll give you
[1:41:21] the keys to to the heaven he said the
[1:41:24] keys of heaven is what un two grants for
[1:41:27] one the baptism lead them to the baptism
[1:41:30] of the Holy Ghost uh he said what you
[1:41:32] binding on Earth what you binding in
[1:41:34] heaven what you loose on Earth what you
[1:41:36] loose in heaven hallelujah what did he
[1:41:39] say huh what about that sopan woman what
[1:41:42] about that ill Fame woman what about the
[1:41:44] illame woman the ill Fame woman that
[1:41:47] caught it right she caught her uh uh
[1:41:49] going to the well to get some water
[1:41:52] remember ill Fame woman she couldn't go
[1:41:54] to the well with the other women is that
[1:41:56] right she had been married five times
[1:41:59] and the sixth one that she had wasn't
[1:42:01] hers uh but at that time uh Jesus said I
[1:42:05] do nothing unless the father first show
[1:42:07] it to me Jesus moved under inspiration
[1:42:10] also is that right he went there to that
[1:42:14] well is that right but in this time here
[1:42:17] what the God gave us a little more
[1:42:20] understanding in that scripture there uh
[1:42:22] what did she do when she went to the
[1:42:23] well uh Jesus knew the men was hungry he
[1:42:26] knew that they needed to get some food
[1:42:28] uh he sent them on their way but the
[1:42:30] father sent Jesus by the Samarian woman
[1:42:33] is that right at that well and when she
[1:42:35] got there she said Jesus she looked he
[1:42:38] said woman give me a drink of water she
[1:42:41] knew the law she knew it that she was
[1:42:44] Ill Fame and she know she was Samaritan
[1:42:47] and she was not supposed to be
[1:42:49] communicating with that Jew so she
[1:42:51] recognized first of all what the Holy
[1:42:54] Spirit tell us brother Robert first
[1:42:56] thing he say she met him as a Jew is
[1:42:58] that right
[1:43:01] Hallelujah huh we got the legalistic in
[1:43:04] here we got the cabalistic in here they
[1:43:07] got to get moved out is that right this
[1:43:09] message is not dos and don'ts uh huh
[1:43:13] this message is by Grace uh it's the
[1:43:15] grace of God uh that he sent us to is
[1:43:18] that right Jesus Christ uh he's a
[1:43:21] gentleman is that right he's a gentleman

[1:43:35] done stole his message he know he got
[1:43:37] this message he done study this message
[1:43:39] he get in but if you listen to him it's
[1:43:41] the wrong
[1:43:44] anointing it's the wrong anointing you
[1:43:47] can't beat on the people like that God's
[1:43:50] not pleasing with that th we wrestle not
[1:43:52] against flesh and blood but against
[1:43:54] principalities and powers and wickedness
[1:43:57] and rulers in high places so we come
[1:43:59] recognizing we're fighting against a
[1:44:02] organized Army is that right but we got
[1:44:05] the answer for Satan don't we is that
[1:44:07] right if what we bind on Heaven bur on
[1:44:10] Earth God is matching us is that right
[1:44:13] we got all Heaven back in us but now she
[1:44:16] didn't stop there is that right she
[1:44:18] didn't stop there she wasn't just the
[1:44:20] daughter of the Prophet she kept going
[1:44:23] she said Jesus what did Jesus tell her
[1:44:25] now now he was the Christ he wasn't the
[1:44:28] Christ yet no he came there he said we
[1:44:30] know you telling me these things uh how
[1:44:33] many husbands that I have uh she said
[1:44:36] that you know that we haven't seen this
[1:44:39] in over what 400 years is that right now
[1:44:42] she saw him as a what a prophet is that
[1:44:45] right after she saw him as a prophet but
[1:44:48] she recognized here some people came
[1:44:51] into the message all they seen was the
[1:44:53] prophet all they doing is quoting the
[1:44:55] prophet but they trying to mix
[1:44:57] Pentecostal anointing huh with the word
[1:45:01] of God in this hour it will not work you
[1:45:04] have to have the second oil you got to
[1:45:08] bring the second oil now that's what he
[1:45:11] said everybody was sleeping in Slumber
[1:45:13] but God broke those seals brought those
[1:45:16] Thunders is that right that's why he
[1:45:18] told us why because when they had to go
[1:45:21] around Jericho and they went around the
[1:45:23] walls of Jericho is that right it said
[1:45:26] six times first day one time next day
[1:45:29] one time then they came what then it was
[1:45:31] the sixth day right but he said now you
[1:45:34] got to go one more time right but on the
[1:45:37] last time do what they got to shout
[1:45:40] right but he did what if you go there
[1:45:42] brother brandham said he never told him
[1:45:45] but he told he didn't tell Joshua how to
[1:45:48] do it he had to be under
[1:45:51] inspiration he then he told Joshua what
[1:45:55] he was supposed to do because Joshua was
[1:45:57] the prophet he was the man that was
[1:45:59] going to lead him is that right we got
[1:46:02] the Joshua now Jehovah savior here in
[1:46:05] our presence in this time uh so what he
[1:46:08] did 1 2 3 4 five 6 7 on the seventh time
[1:46:15] he said then what when the what kind of
[1:46:17] horn the Ram's Horn not any kind of horn
[1:46:22] the Rams Horn the Rams Horn represents
[1:46:26] the
[1:46:27] Messiah why the Messiah they had the
[1:46:30] word of the hour it was the seventh
[1:46:33] church he come around there the seventh
[1:46:36] angel messenger is the only one that had
[1:46:40] it he had to go around and fill the gaps
[1:46:43] in and once he filled the Gap we the
[1:46:46] only ones could shout and tear down
[1:46:49] Satan's King
[1:46:52] [Applause]
[1:46:59] don't have time to fuss get in your
[1:47:03] position get in your position so God can
[1:47:06] use you so he can use you when that
[1:47:09] anointing comes he come around in there
[1:47:12] what did he do only the seven after the
[1:47:15] seventh Church age then he come down
[1:47:18] open those Seven Seals God name you got
[1:47:21] to go in there that's another lesson you
[1:47:23] I want to trying to do better by staying
[1:47:24] on my point inspiration under the
[1:47:27] inspiration of God uh then the woman
[1:47:30] that was there uh at the well is that
[1:47:33] right she ran by she caught him by what
[1:47:39] inspiration then as he came there and
[1:47:42] then the woman she recognized it wasn't
[1:47:44] going to just stop at what brother
[1:47:46] brandham said is that right brother
[1:47:49] brandham now he brother Brandon was the
[1:47:51] wave sheet he was the wave sheet that
[1:47:54] God sent us he was an example to what
[1:47:57] he's going to use us for is that right

[1:48:05] little sisters he can use you God has
[1:48:08] chosen all of us for a purpose is that
[1:48:12] right you got to understand uh what God
[1:48:15] called you for get before the Lord lay
[1:48:18] before the Lord and see what called you
[1:48:20] for he called you to use you Saints then
[1:48:24] after she recognized when he told her
[1:48:27] these things she said wait a minute she
[1:48:29] said thou are the what the Christ the
[1:48:32] son of the Living God uh he did what

[1:59:58] down just sitting there like he told I
[2:00:01] know the demon was messing with his mind
[2:00:03] I know where it
[2:00:05] was I
[2:00:07] again came back next week we work with a
[2:00:10] little lesson three stages of Grace
[2:00:13] y'all don't realize how blessed you
[2:00:18] are
[2:00:19] you have a time getting past the correct
[2:00:22] baptism with
[2:00:24] them them religious demons is
[2:00:27] rough they got a lock on them like that
[2:00:31] tradition tradition is a terrible
[2:00:35] demon and when he come in there then uh
[2:00:38] he got there and

[2:00:55] Token anything like that I said here's
[2:00:59] justification sanctification set aside

[2:01:07] he said I want that
[2:01:10] token yes
[2:01:12] [Applause]
[2:01:18] sir I thought the man couldn't
[2:01:21] [Applause]
[2:01:22] talk I'm telling you what God is
[2:01:26] doing see Eagles don't fly in
[2:01:30] bunches you don't know what he's going
[2:01:32] to send where he's going to send you at
[2:01:34] what he's going to do but they treated
[2:01:36] with respect and he prayed with him and
[2:01:39] I'm believing I'mma see him on the other
[2:01:42] side I believe that God rich in Mercy
[2:01:46] under the inspiration in God's presence
[2:01:49] is that right that's why the holy spirit
[2:01:51] said you have the grain of the faith of
[2:01:54] a mustard seed is that right when that
[2:01:57] grain grow up it's going to gray up into
[2:01:59] a big tree is that right what's that
[2:02:02] tree is a tree of what tree of life
[2:02:05] that's why he told us in this hour
[2:02:07] brother Brandon showed him what did he
[2:02:09] say Pastor he said I preach what Paul
[2:02:12] preached until what until what after the
[2:02:16] Seven Seals uh and after the Seven Seals
[2:02:19] what did he do then now he gave us an
[2:02:23] example about doing what creating What
[2:02:26] squirrels uh asking for those things
[2:02:28] speaking those things uh he said the
[2:02:31] works that I do but we should do a what
[2:02:34] a greater work is that right what is
[2:02:36] that greatest work that greater work is
[2:02:39] we going to be able to speak things into
[2:02:41] existence that's why he says after he
[2:02:44] got past Paul and he brought it up to
[2:02:47] this time now brother brandham has
[2:02:49] mooved into the Covenant Angel Ministry
[2:02:52] is that right he had to give us an
[2:02:54] example of what we going to do Saints
[2:02:57] that's why it's no longer playing church
[2:02:59] we have to turn the corner it's time to
[2:03:02] get out of here soon and very soon we
[2:03:06] are going to do a see the king I can't

[2:03:26] it another way but that's okay I know
[2:03:29] the Lord did what he was going to do I
[2:03:31] didn't want
[2:03:33] to the Lord really gave me
[2:03:35] strength CU I'm not here to glorify the

[2:11:11] but never his word because his word will
[2:11:14] never be broken amen church we have
[2:11:17] turned the
[2:11:20] cor the time is very treacherous and
[2:11:24] whatever I have taught
[2:11:26] here because I don't teach my
[2:11:30] thought I usually bring you scripture
[2:11:33] and bring you quot to show you what the
[2:11:36] prophet says and what the Bible says if
[2:11:39] there is any interpretation in the
[2:11:41] scripture I have to wait for Malachi 4
[2:11:44] to give me the tools to put into the
[2:11:46] Bible and unlock the the Bible and I
[2:11:48] know that I'm venturing with the
[2:11:50] authority of a Vindicated Prophet amen
[2:11:54] when he says that a woman in the Bible
[2:11:57] means the church then every time I see a
[2:12:00] woman I just unlock church and I keep
[2:12:02] moving because that's the authorized
[2:12:06] spoke man word of God himself th have
[2:12:11] been said I will never back up one
[2:12:16] in in anything
[2:12:19] amen if something is laid out here is
[2:12:22] presented I would never back up one in
[2:12:26] from it because I'm under commission I
[2:12:29] have to deliver what he tght me and I
[2:12:31] have to stay with what he Tau me
[2:12:34] regardless if it's going to cost me your
[2:12:36] friendship so be it if it if if it's
[2:12:40] going to cost me a popularity so be it
[2:12:43] whatever is going to cost me so be it
[2:12:47] amen
[2:12:48] I don't want to face him with anybody's
[2:12:51] blood in my hand amen if you never been
[2:12:55] taught before I will show Grace and I
[2:12:58] will say they don't know I need to bring
[2:13:01] it and show you this is what the word
[2:13:03] say and then we move on even if you make
[2:13:06] a mistake I will still show Grace but I
[2:13:09] have to stay with the word because I
[2:13:11] don't want anyone to call me deceiver in
[2:13:15] a hospital bed no one will do that
[2:13:19] so I'm on the commission I can back up
[2:13:22] especially if I see it in the message
[2:13:25] and in the word of God that say don't
[2:13:27] even negotiate with me I will not take
[2:13:30] it amen I will stay with it if you ask
[2:13:33] me a question I give you what brother
[2:13:34] brandham say what does it mean it means
[2:13:37] what brother Bram say what does it mean
[2:13:39] it means what the scripture says and
[2:13:41] that's what I Su stand amen so learn to
[2:13:46] take our personal stuff away and I
[2:13:50] understand that this is Brother Steven
[2:13:52] we can smile but at a certain time I
[2:13:55] have to straighten the word I have to go
[2:13:58] straight with the word and period I'm
[2:14:00] not going to change it's not anything
[2:14:02] personal I'm not fighting against you
[2:14:06] I'm fighting against a demon that is
[2:14:08] trying to destroy you amen I have people
[2:14:12] that I know that are in very serious
[2:14:15] condition Now situation now they don't
[2:14:17] even know how to to come out it will
[2:14:18] only take God all of that because they
[2:14:21] didn't hear when we told them and
[2:14:24] sometime when they tell you something
[2:14:26] you might not see the result in two
[2:14:29] month in one year in two years it looks
[2:14:32] like everything is working fine because
[2:14:34] you move on your own way but after 3
[2:14:37] years whatever you going to reap there I
[2:14:40] will be the one suffering instead of
[2:14:42] staying with my wife I have to be there
[2:14:45] in the corner she knows praying at night
[2:14:47] 2:00 because you didn't listen to what I
[2:14:50] told you and now I'm staying up till
[2:14:52] 2:00 a.m. in the morning pleading with
[2:14:55] the Lord to make you understand or to
[2:14:57] open your eyes so you can see what I'm
[2:14:59] saying that's why every day after I
[2:15:01] finish preaching I tell you I love
[2:15:04] you love is
[2:15:06] corrective I love you but I won't back
[2:15:09] up I won't back up to the word I have to
[2:15:12] stay with what the prophet say Amen

[2:15:17] consecrate continue to pray continue to
[2:15:20] pray for the question and answer on on
[2:15:22] Saturday and pray for the service
