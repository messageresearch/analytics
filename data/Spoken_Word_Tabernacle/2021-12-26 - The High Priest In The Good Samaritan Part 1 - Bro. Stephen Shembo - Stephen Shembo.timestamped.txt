[31:42] we'll see if we have time
[31:45] that the pastor always tells me
[31:48] we got one service
[31:50] somebody wants to sing
[31:52] amen
[31:56] so i will probably sing the new note
[31:58] second i'm gonna ask brother robert to
[32:00] um
[32:01] sing his song last
[32:04] the song that he sang a couple
[32:06] wednesdays ago really touched my heart
[32:09] so um
[32:11] i thought it might be good to hear it on
[32:12] a sunday morning
[32:24] [Music]
[32:31] i mean i just want you to join with me
[32:33] singing this song
[32:35] just if we just take a look at what's
[32:36] going on around the world
[32:38] around us i mean uh we just sing this
[32:41] song with understanding because
[32:43] a lot of people think they still have
[32:44] enough time on this earth but
[32:47] i just listened to whatever last night
[32:49] and it was talking about how
[32:51] it's even later that we think it is
[32:54] um so let's just not be struck away with
[32:56] the things of the world and the movement
[32:58] or whatever is going on around us but i

[57:20] pretty close
[57:22] just touch it up a little bit
[57:24] at the beginning i didn't hear those
[57:26] stuff now

[57:30] yeah it's a lot of it
[57:32] work with it a little bit brother mike
[57:34] if you can touch up a little bit
[57:36] luke chapter 10 if you're there you can
[57:38] say amen the devil is wasting his time
[57:44] verse 30
[57:48] and jesus answering say
[57:51] a certain
[57:52] man went down
[57:56] from jerusalem
[57:58] do you know that man
[58:02] you might be seated
[58:04] that's why you need a
[58:07] a prophet
[58:09] there is a man
[58:11] the bible says certain man
[58:17] we don't know who that man is
[58:25] there is a bible within this bible
[58:30] [Music]
[58:31] you see this bible there is a bible
[58:33] within the bible
[58:37] so you can read
[58:39] but you don't see the bible
[58:42] but it's in the bible
[58:46] and for you to see that bible
[58:49] you need a prophet
[58:52] only a prophet
[58:54] can pull the bible out
[58:59] amen
[59:00] the old testament was there
[59:02] everybody was holding the old testament
[59:04] and reading the same scripture over and
[59:06] over
[59:07] until paul came
[59:09] in
[59:10] and paul entered to the old testament
[59:13] and begin to extend the bible
[59:18] in other words stretch the bible
[59:21] then the bible is now the old testament
[59:24] and the new testament
[59:27] but still there were some
[59:31] [Music]
[59:33] amen
[59:35] only a prophet
[59:37] can get there and pull it out
[59:41] if not the letter will kill you
[59:48] go read the old testament
[59:50] go under the levitical law
[59:52] you will see their color
[59:55] the color of the high priest and their
[59:57] dressing we're going to go through all
[59:58] of them
[1:00:01] except jesus come
[1:00:02] we're going to go through all of them
[1:00:04] the clothing of the high priest go check
[1:00:06] the catholic church
[1:00:10] look at what they're wearing look at
[1:00:12] that do you think they're doing that
[1:00:13] just by right now
[1:00:15] [Music]
[1:00:17] it's coming from the old testament
[1:00:19] but they missed the point
[1:00:21] [Music]
[1:00:24] hallelujah jesus answering say a certain
[1:00:28] man
[1:00:29] went down
[1:00:30] from jerusalem
[1:00:32] this man was not going up
[1:00:35] everybody
[1:00:36] he was going down
[1:00:38] so if you're going down
[1:00:40] that means you were in a high position
[1:00:45] and you begin to drop down to a lower
[1:00:48] position
[1:00:49] so this man is going down
[1:00:52] everybody
[1:00:54] from where from jerusalem
[1:00:56] why jerusalem
[1:01:01] where is he going
[1:01:05] a certain man went down from jerusalem
[1:01:08] to jericho
[1:01:10] so
[1:01:11] this right here is telling you that
[1:01:14] jerusalem should be up
[1:01:17] amen and jericho
[1:01:19] should be down
[1:01:21] and this man begin to travel
[1:01:24] from a highest point
[1:01:27] but as he's moving
[1:01:29] he's dropping down
[1:01:33] amen
[1:01:35] come on and fell among thieves
[1:01:39] so in this road
[1:01:41] between jerusalem to jericho
[1:01:44] this rome here this road is infested
[1:01:48] with thieves
[1:01:52] not one but many
[1:01:55] we okay now
[1:01:58] just relax
[1:02:00] amen
[1:02:02] and the thief did what the thief which
[1:02:05] strip him
[1:02:06] of his remnant
[1:02:08] in other words this man has a clothe
[1:02:11] he was not naked
[1:02:16] when he left jerusalem he has a clothe
[1:02:20] and he begin his journey but as he
[1:02:23] continued on his journey he was not
[1:02:25] going up
[1:02:26] he was going down
[1:02:28] and back here
[1:02:30] then a few of a bunch of thieves cut him
[1:02:34] and the first thing they did they strip
[1:02:37] off his clothes
[1:02:39] so the first action of a thief
[1:02:42] was to remove or to strip
[1:02:46] his clothes
[1:02:48] how many clothing did they say
[1:02:52] how many
[1:02:54] women how many women
[1:02:59] one
[1:03:00] rainman anybody here
[1:03:03] okay
[1:03:04] yeah amen
[1:03:06] come on
[1:03:07] and
[1:03:08] wounded him
[1:03:10] so the second thing
[1:03:12] that wounded him
[1:03:17] so when these thieves met him
[1:03:20] anybody here
[1:03:22] they didn't wound him
[1:03:24] right away
[1:03:25] first they took the clothing off of him
[1:03:28] amen are you following me
[1:03:32] and then the same thief
[1:03:34] not a different faith
[1:03:37] the same one
[1:03:38] amen
[1:03:39] change
[1:03:46] they changed their action
[1:03:52] everybody here at the beginning they
[1:03:54] just took a jacket off
[1:03:56] but the man is still there
[1:03:58] then on the second level they begin to
[1:04:01] wound him in other words what was only
[1:04:03] taken off of the garment now it's a
[1:04:06] physical
[1:04:07] [Music]
[1:04:08] they are wounding somebody physically
[1:04:11] at the beginning they just took the
[1:04:12] garment off
[1:04:14] somebody can take your garment off
[1:04:16] and you can run away there was a man
[1:04:18] that was following jesus christ
[1:04:20] they took a garment off and he ran away
[1:04:23] naked
[1:04:24] the bible says that america but they
[1:04:27] didn't stop the number one they removed
[1:04:29] the raymond as soon as they removed the
[1:04:31] remnant then they flipped to the second
[1:04:34] thing they begin to catch the man in the
[1:04:36] physical
[1:04:36] [Music]
[1:04:38] wounded man
[1:04:41] amen
[1:04:42] what a road
[1:04:44] camera and departed
[1:04:47] leaving him
[1:04:48] half dead
[1:04:51] back here
[1:04:52] when they wounded him the third thing
[1:04:54] that happened to this man he was left
[1:04:57] half dead
[1:04:59] what does half dead mean
[1:05:02] he was not quite totally dead
[1:05:05] hey
[1:05:07] when they say half
[1:05:09] are we okay
[1:05:10] am i reading a different bubble
[1:05:12] are you sleeping
[1:05:14] so if you take a hole
[1:05:17] there we and you divide it in half
[1:05:20] everybody here part of this is already
[1:05:23] dead
[1:05:26] anybody here
[1:05:27] and there is a part that is still alive
[1:05:31] that's why they say half
[1:05:33] dead
[1:05:40] oh boy
[1:05:42] it is not me to the message
[1:05:45] amen
[1:05:46] verse 31 and by chance
[1:05:51] he was he really by chance
[1:05:55] and by chance
[1:05:58] there came down
[1:06:00] a certain man that way
[1:06:06] who came
[1:06:08] why not a regular man
[1:06:12] why not a normal man maybe
[1:06:15] a farmer
[1:06:16] maybe uh
[1:06:18] a businessman was traveling
[1:06:21] but the one who's telling the story is
[1:06:23] jesus christ
[1:06:25] amen
[1:06:26] and when jesus is talking about the
[1:06:28] story he put the priest there
[1:06:33] so in this road
[1:06:35] there is a priest
[1:06:39] that is also traveling
[1:06:41] let me call him a
[1:06:44] anybody here a priest
[1:06:48] that way
[1:06:50] because when you see a priest and
[1:06:52] somebody's wounded what do you expect
[1:06:56] what do you expect
[1:06:58] so help him
[1:07:01] we okay
[1:07:03] help him
[1:07:06] help him
[1:07:08] through a priest
[1:07:11] so maybe that man when he saw the priest
[1:07:14] because you can tell a priest from
[1:07:15] pharaoh
[1:07:17] when we're going to get into the
[1:07:18] clothing of the high priest and the
[1:07:19] priest you will understand that when you
[1:07:21] look at the priest from far off you can
[1:07:23] tell oh that's a pastor coming up there
[1:07:25] because there was a certain way the
[1:07:28] priest dressed that you can tell from
[1:07:29] pharaoh so when that man was in agony
[1:07:33] right there when he looked he saw the
[1:07:34] priest he said oh thank you jesus
[1:07:37] thank you jesus for sending me a priest
[1:07:40] praise the lord and now i'm rescued
[1:07:44] [Music]
[1:07:45] and when he saw him the priesthood
[1:07:49] he passed by
[1:07:51] on the other side
[1:07:54] [Music]
[1:07:56] it was help
[1:07:57] when the priest saw it
[1:08:00] [Music]
[1:08:04] that behavior you will expect it for a
[1:08:07] neighbor
[1:08:08] you will expect it from a businessman
[1:08:10] you will expect that from maybe a farmer
[1:08:13] but that behavior came from a priest
[1:08:19] let's go to verse 32.
[1:08:21] that's why i told you i need time
[1:08:24] verse 32 and likewise and water
[1:08:28] oh
[1:08:34] what is the difference between the two
[1:08:37] elevate
[1:08:41] who was responsible for the temple
[1:08:44] so when you see a lever coming up what
[1:08:46] do you expect
[1:08:53] see how we can close here and you go
[1:08:54] home you already got it
[1:08:57] amen
[1:08:58] and like was a leaver
[1:09:00] when he was at the place
[1:09:03] came
[1:09:04] and look on him
[1:09:06] the first one saw
[1:09:09] and went away the other one approaches a
[1:09:12] little bit closer to at least look
[1:09:15] so when the man saw him getting closer
[1:09:17] to him he said oh at least this one is
[1:09:19] merciful
[1:09:21] then he approaches but when he looked
[1:09:24] let's see he came and looked on him come
[1:09:27] on and pass by
[1:09:30] on the other side behave just like the
[1:09:33] priest
[1:09:37] so it's done
[1:09:40] if it was a man that was drinking
[1:09:43] smoking that did this we will understand
[1:09:45] we say you know what that's a smoker
[1:09:47] forget about it he's not going to help
[1:09:49] anybody that meant he's always in a
[1:09:51] nightclub he's not going to help anybody
[1:09:53] that man is always a bad man we know him
[1:09:55] the whole neighborhood know him
[1:09:57] but this is a priest
[1:09:59] and this is a leavert
[1:10:03] where we expect to have help but there
[1:10:05] was no help anybody here
[1:10:07] verse 33
[1:10:09] but
[1:10:10] you know when they say but means
[1:10:11] something is going to be contrary to
[1:10:14] what you saw right
[1:10:15] but a certain samaritan do we know him
[1:10:21] a certain man
[1:10:24] we don't know him
[1:10:26] his identity is
[1:10:29] sealed
[1:10:33] and a certain samaritan
[1:10:38] everybody care
[1:10:39] do we know him
[1:10:41] so his identity also is sealed
[1:10:44] this identity and this one both contain
[1:10:48] certain certain
[1:10:50] we don't know them
[1:10:52] but this we can tell who they are
[1:10:56] okay this one we even know that he's a
[1:10:59] samaritan
[1:11:01] this one do we know if he's a jew
[1:11:03] do we know if he's a samaritan do we
[1:11:06] know if he is uh hidden
[1:11:08] or agenda
[1:11:13] but a certain samaritan
[1:11:16] as he journey
[1:11:18] anybody
[1:11:20] so this man when he was journeying there
[1:11:22] was also a samaritan that was journey
[1:11:27] back here the samaritan was journeying
[1:11:31] while this man also was journeying
[1:11:34] anybody here
[1:11:36] as he journey
[1:11:38] came where he was the third one
[1:11:41] so when the men turn he says samaritan
[1:11:43] he said well
[1:11:46] the priest
[1:11:47] left me here
[1:11:49] delivered
[1:11:50] left me here
[1:11:52] this one it's american again
[1:11:56] do you know the woman at the well
[1:11:58] when he met jesus christ just to give
[1:12:01] somebody water
[1:12:02] he said you a jew me a samaritan
[1:12:07] we don't deal together
[1:12:09] just water now think about helping a man
[1:12:13] [Music]
[1:12:15] everybody here
[1:12:16] if the priest could not do it if the
[1:12:19] levite was unable to help how much more
[1:12:23] a water
[1:12:25] if they went to the other the samaritan
[1:12:27] won't even get closer
[1:12:29] he will even turn around and go back
[1:12:31] home
[1:12:35] amen
[1:12:36] why did jesus put a samaritan there
[1:12:39] [Music]
[1:12:41] because a levert is a jew
[1:12:44] a priest is a jew and jesus left the
[1:12:47] jews
[1:12:50] and went into the samaritan
[1:12:53] and took a samaritan and put him
[1:12:56] in uh
[1:12:57] an allegory
[1:12:59] of a man better than the jews
[1:13:03] and not only better than the jews but
[1:13:05] better than the spiritual leaders
[1:13:09] of israel
[1:13:13] better than a priest
[1:13:16] better than delivered the chosen
[1:13:19] generation
[1:13:20] of israel
[1:13:22] that man is better than them
[1:13:25] who is that man
[1:13:29] you know his name
[1:13:31] can you help me
[1:13:33] no brother in jail
[1:13:34] [Laughter]
[1:13:36] amen
[1:13:37] but a certain samaritan as he journey
[1:13:41] came where he was
[1:13:43] and when he saw him amen he had water
[1:13:48] what is compassion
[1:13:53] the key of this samaritan
[1:13:57] is compassion
[1:14:03] amen
[1:14:04] compassion amen
[1:14:06] he had compassion on him
[1:14:09] and went to him
[1:14:11] amen
[1:14:12] and burned him up and burned up his
[1:14:15] water
[1:14:17] the first thing
[1:14:18] the samaritan he began to take care of
[1:14:21] his wounds
[1:14:25] and he was banding them up
[1:14:30] banding up of her wounds
[1:14:32] everybody here
[1:14:34] karma
[1:14:35] pouring in water
[1:14:38] and water
[1:14:39] [Music]
[1:14:41] is he clicking something
[1:14:45] ever here
[1:14:46] so before he burn
[1:14:48] this samaritan have oil
[1:14:51] and wine
[1:14:56] you read your bible
[1:14:58] do you really read your bible if you
[1:15:00] read your bible you will understand
[1:15:04] [Music]
[1:15:06] he was pouring
[1:15:08] oil
[1:15:10] and wine
[1:15:12] not oily only
[1:15:14] not wine only
[1:15:16] but oil and wine
[1:15:19] so when this man was traveling he was
[1:15:21] having oil and wine
[1:15:30] and when he went to him
[1:15:32] and burned his wound
[1:15:34] pouring in oil and wine
[1:15:38] and set him on his own water
[1:15:41] so this man has a beast
[1:15:47] i don't know if we will call this part
[1:15:49] one or what
[1:15:51] this man has his own beast
[1:15:54] do you follow me
[1:15:55] you have to understand this
[1:15:57] so when he was traveling the man was
[1:16:00] using his beast
[1:16:03] and back here and keep singing a
[1:16:05] samaritan and keep going maybe he was
[1:16:07] talking about jacob because their father
[1:16:09] was jacob and he kept moving moving
[1:16:11] moving but when he saw the samaritan
[1:16:14] ah the wounded man
[1:16:16] he left his beast
[1:16:19] do you follow me
[1:16:20] after taking care of the man
[1:16:23] he took the man and the one who was
[1:16:26] riding the beast now was not him
[1:16:33] ever hear the one who was one who was
[1:16:36] riding the beast
[1:16:38] was now the one who was wounded
[1:16:42] he became the driver
[1:16:45] [Applause]
[1:16:46] [Music]
[1:16:47] [Applause]
[1:16:47] [Music]
[1:16:49] ever here
[1:16:51] this man when he was traveling he was
[1:16:54] using his feet
[1:16:56] but here maybe he get tired but at this
[1:16:59] time his feet don't work anymore his
[1:17:02] human effort
[1:17:05] were no longer needed
[1:17:08] for the journey
[1:17:09] but here they put him in the car
[1:17:14] and they put him a new chore
[1:17:16] [Applause]
[1:17:17] and they told him just hang on to the
[1:17:19] beast
[1:17:20] that's all you have to do
[1:17:22] i know the road then the man begin to
[1:17:24] take him
[1:17:25] ever here
[1:17:26] he was the good samaritan
[1:17:29] that begin to lead him where he wanted
[1:17:32] to take him
[1:17:34] amen
[1:17:37] because the man was broken
[1:17:41] he needed a different gps
[1:17:45] a back here
[1:17:47] and went to him and burned him with his
[1:17:49] wound pouring in oil and won and set him
[1:17:53] in his own beast camera
[1:17:56] and brought him to a water
[1:18:02] brought him to an inn
[1:18:04] you know jesus was looking for a name to
[1:18:07] get born
[1:18:08] and there was no place in
[1:18:13] and took care of him
[1:18:16] so when he took him to the inn
[1:18:19] this same samaritan
[1:18:21] took care of him
[1:18:26] so all of this
[1:18:29] is
[1:18:30] an experience
[1:18:33] do you follow me
[1:18:34] an experience
[1:18:37] between
[1:18:38] the unknown man
[1:18:40] and the unknown samaritan
[1:18:43] anybody here
[1:18:44] and if you get closer to an inn

[1:19:16] took him all the way to the inn and got
[1:19:19] there and sat with him all of this is an
[1:19:21] experience on one day

[1:25:00] in other words you
[1:25:03] can be
[1:25:04] a good samaritan
[1:25:08] there is a good samaritan
[1:25:10] but this ministry here can be put on you
[1:25:18] and you can do it because god will never
[1:25:21] ask you to do something that you cannot
[1:25:23] do
[1:25:24] [Music]
[1:25:25] we okay
[1:25:27] let's go to john chapter 12.
[1:25:31] just the reading of the scripture
[1:25:33] he makes it all good
[1:25:37] amen
[1:25:39] john chapter 12 verse 1.
[1:25:42] you stay up stay tight because it's a
[1:25:45] different avenue
[1:25:47] if you're there you can say amen
[1:25:49] we already understand the missed
[1:25:51] generation the generation of melchizedek
[1:25:54] amen
[1:25:56] the lineage is nothing among the human
[1:25:58] being
[1:25:59] and the lineage of his broad also is not
[1:26:02] among human beings
[1:26:04] amen
[1:26:05] john chapter 12 verse 1 then six days
[1:26:08] before the passover
[1:26:11] so the passover was on which day
[1:26:17] did i write the bible
[1:26:19] i'm just reading it
[1:26:21] and six days before the passover meaning
[1:26:23] the passover was on the seventh day
[1:26:26] amen
[1:26:28] came to bethany
[1:26:30] where lazarus
[1:26:33] then jesus six day before the passover
[1:26:35] came to bethany when lazarus was which
[1:26:38] has been dead whom he raised from the
[1:26:41] dead
[1:26:44] power of resurrection
[1:26:46] there they made him a supper
[1:26:48] and marta served it's a whole message
[1:26:51] there but lazarus was one of them that
[1:26:54] sat at the table with him the
[1:26:56] resurrected was now sitting on the table
[1:26:59] that's a different story let's leave it
[1:27:00] alone verse three then took mary
[1:27:03] a pound of ointment of sparcanard
[1:27:07] very costly
[1:27:08] and anointed the feet of jesus
[1:27:11] and wiped his feet with her hair
[1:27:13] and the house was filled with the order
[1:27:16] of the ointment
[1:27:18] then say one of this his disciple
[1:27:23] who his name was who
[1:27:25] judas iscariot
[1:27:27] salmon son
[1:27:28] which should betray him
[1:27:30] why was not this ointment sold for three
[1:27:34] pants 300 pence and given to the water
[1:27:38] you see sometimes somebody does
[1:27:40] something for someone
[1:27:43] and somebody say no we should not have
[1:27:44] wasted that money like that
[1:27:51] we should use this money for this this
[1:27:53] and it sounds good
[1:27:56] when they give the idea the idea usually
[1:27:58] sounds good but the motive behind it is
[1:28:02] not really what they're saying
[1:28:06] they just don't want you to spend that
[1:28:08] money for
[1:28:10] brother hamilton
[1:28:15] amen
[1:28:17] hallelujah
[1:28:18] why was not this ointment sold for 300
[1:28:21] pence and given to the poor verse 6
[1:28:24] this he said
[1:28:26] not that he cared
[1:28:28] for the poor
[1:28:30] this one nobody can see it only god
[1:28:33] that's right no no no no no brother we
[1:28:34] don't have to spend this money it's not
[1:28:36] good but really in the heart that's not
[1:28:39] what they're trying to do
[1:28:41] here
[1:28:42] but
[1:28:43] because he was a
[1:28:47] judas
[1:28:49] was whoa who was who
[1:28:54] you have not caught it yet
[1:28:56] who attacked this man from jerusalem
[1:29:02] now you got it
[1:29:04] who attacked this man from jerusalem
[1:29:11] so this spirit
[1:29:17] anybody here
[1:29:18] here in one man
[1:29:20] over there in many men

[1:32:15] your works what
[1:32:18] perfection cannot come here
[1:32:22] the law could not bring anything to
[1:32:24] perfection
[1:32:27] are you seeing the sermon coming up
[1:32:30] right here
[1:32:31] for i have not found your words perfect
[1:32:34] before god everybody
[1:32:36] now let's pray
[1:32:38] heavenly father lord we thank you for
[1:32:41] your grace your love your mercy father
[1:32:43] and for everything you have been doing
[1:32:45] for us lord thank you for giving us
[1:32:47] another opportunity and time to gather
[1:32:50] together around the revealed word of the
[1:32:52] hour
[1:32:53] lord like we always repeat and we will
[1:32:56] continue to repeat because we understand
[1:32:59] that our sufficiency is not our own our
[1:33:02] sufficiency is coming from thee father
[1:33:04] we have done everything that we can do
[1:33:07] if you have given a man an ability to
[1:33:09] read the scripture that's all he can do
[1:33:12] but when he comes to interpret the
[1:33:13] scripture and to unfold the word and to
[1:33:16] give a personal relation
[1:33:19] revelation to your children only you the
[1:33:21] holy spirit can do it lord father that's
[1:33:24] why we asking that you move us
[1:33:26] completely out of the way may you come
[1:33:28] again and speak to your children lord
[1:33:30] father remember those that are streaming
[1:33:32] online lord i can see some from
[1:33:35] different countries father may you bless
[1:33:37] them and may lord father you be the one
[1:33:39] speaking and not me because there is
[1:33:42] nothing in a human being that he can
[1:33:44] help another human being because we are
[1:33:46] all dependent from thee we committed all
[1:33:49] and ask it in the name of jesus christ
[1:33:52] amen
[1:33:54] god bless you
[1:33:57] all right
[1:33:58] my subject is the high priest
[1:34:02] in the good samaritan
[1:34:04] america
[1:34:06] the high priest
[1:34:08] because we found out who our high
[1:34:09] priestess
[1:34:11] we know that we have a high priest
[1:34:13] under the order of melchizedek and the
[1:34:16] high priest is the lord jesus christ
[1:34:18] but we want to see our high priest
[1:34:22] in the good samaritan
[1:34:24] everybody
[1:34:25] in other words when you leave this
[1:34:27] church
[1:34:28] when you read the good samaritan you're
[1:34:30] not going to see the good samaritan
[1:34:32] anymore
[1:34:33] you will see somebody in the good
[1:34:35] samaritan hey but here
[1:34:38] we have been dealing with the mystery of
[1:34:41] the level
[1:34:42] and this goes together with the mystery
[1:34:45] of the level i could call it part eight
[1:34:47] or something but the reason why i'm
[1:34:49] doing this so it's gonna be easier for
[1:34:51] you down the road if you want to go
[1:34:53] through a reference you can go back and
[1:34:56] find it quickly but here
[1:34:58] when we talk about this we found about
[1:35:01] that the level is something that is
[1:35:04] connected together with the priesthood
[1:35:07] here you can remember the oldest sermon
[1:35:10] amen and once you farm that priesthood
[1:35:13] it will help you to understand a lot of
[1:35:15] stuff
[1:35:17] now when we were in hebrew
[1:35:19] chapter 7
[1:35:21] we unfolded with melchizedek
[1:35:24] the bible says in hebrews 7 verse 5
[1:35:27] and verily
[1:35:29] they
[1:35:30] that are the sons of liver
[1:35:34] who receive the office of the priesthood
[1:35:38] right here
[1:35:40] we can see that paul
[1:35:43] is calling the priesthood in office
[1:35:49] hey berkey
[1:35:50] i want you to follow me carefully keep
[1:35:53] your seatbelt in hey
[1:35:55] he said they that are the son of liver
[1:35:59] who received the office of the
[1:36:01] priesthood so the priesthood has an
[1:36:04] office
[1:36:06] here
[1:36:08] have a commandment to take that
[1:36:11] of the people according to the law
[1:36:14] that is of their
[1:36:15] brethren
[1:36:17] in other words when god chose israel as
[1:36:20] a nation
[1:36:22] everybody in israel were brothers and
[1:36:25] sisters
[1:36:27] anybody care
[1:36:29] they were present together anybody care
[1:36:32] and out of that chunk of brethren
[1:36:35] everybody
[1:36:36] god selected a certain tribe
[1:36:40] did you follow me
[1:36:41] and pulled that tribe and that tribe was
[1:36:44] the tribe of liver
[1:36:47] and that tribe was given the charge
[1:36:51] to take the third from their own brother
[1:36:54] amen so from the beginning all of them
[1:36:57] are the same
[1:37:00] anybody here
[1:37:01] all of them were brothers
[1:37:03] but there was one brother that god
[1:37:06] picked
[1:37:07] and put him a little bit higher
[1:37:10] than the other brother
[1:37:13] i have to go this way amen
[1:37:16] the people according to the law that is
[1:37:19] of their brethren
[1:37:21] though they came out of the launch of
[1:37:23] who
[1:37:24] in other words when we look naturally
[1:37:27] speaking because there is two seeds of
[1:37:30] abraham we have the natural seed of
[1:37:32] abraham you remember and we also have
[1:37:34] the spiritual seed of abraham so when we
[1:37:37] are dealing with the natural seed of
[1:37:39] abraham
[1:37:40] in that seed
[1:37:42] everybody was brother
[1:37:45] but among those brethren there was a
[1:37:48] selected group of brethren
[1:37:51] that was taken up
[1:37:53] and given the office
[1:37:56] of the priesthood everybody
[1:37:58] and when they get the office of the
[1:38:00] priesthood they were responsible for the
[1:38:04] spiritual aspect of the entire nation
[1:38:07] and back here and if you want to give
[1:38:10] your taving
[1:38:11] you're not going to give your taving to
[1:38:15] like abraham did
[1:38:17] you god give your diving to those
[1:38:20] brothers
[1:38:23] [Music]
[1:38:24] hallelujah
[1:38:26] the bible continued he says verse 6
[1:38:30] but he you remember this last sunday
[1:38:33] whose descent
[1:38:35] is not counted from them
[1:38:37] receive type of abraham and bless him
[1:38:41] the head the water
[1:38:44] if you can allow me i believe you
[1:38:45] already got this together
[1:38:48] so we found here that there is
[1:38:50] two lineage hey mark here
[1:38:53] the first lineage is the natural lineage
[1:38:55] of of abraham we already talked about it
[1:38:58] a lot we have abraham with the natural
[1:39:01] lineage and back here and we have which
[1:39:04] goes through isaac we already explained
[1:39:06] this over and over then we have the
[1:39:08] spiritual lineage of abraham and the
[1:39:11] spiritual lineage goes through
[1:39:12] melchizedek
[1:39:14] hey mark here
[1:39:16] no problem so the bible say he whose
[1:39:18] descent is not content from them receive
[1:39:22] god from abraham and bless him the head
[1:39:26] promise every year
[1:39:28] so if the natural seed
[1:39:31] everybody is brother
[1:39:34] everybody here
[1:39:36] and one of the brother
[1:39:38] has been chosen and elevated above the
[1:39:42] brother to receive darting we must see
[1:39:46] the same thing in the spiritual
[1:39:50] brother
[1:39:51] uh
[1:39:52] give me a little bit more let's go to
[1:39:54] hebrew
[1:39:56] chapter 1
[1:39:59] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:40:09] i hope you were not caught up in
[1:40:11] christmas stuff
[1:40:15] that cool you down
[1:40:18] because we spoke about christmas last
[1:40:20] sunday
[1:40:21] we touch up again just reminding you
[1:40:24] so if you do what you're doing you're
[1:40:25] responsible not me
[1:40:27] everybody care
[1:40:29] a preacher gave you the whole counsel of
[1:40:31] god if you understand that praise god
[1:40:35] if you don't i will continue to pray to
[1:40:37] plead so the lord give you a revelation
[1:40:40] and you understand that it's wrong
[1:40:42] anybody care
[1:40:44] let's go to hebrew chapter one verse
[1:40:47] eight if you dare you can say amen thank
[1:40:49] you brother caleb but to the son
[1:40:52] we understand this son
[1:40:53] he says
[1:40:55] your throne oh god
[1:40:58] a son is god
[1:41:00] because a son a child will be born
[1:41:03] his name will be counselor
[1:41:06] prince of peace
[1:41:08] and what
[1:41:09] that son is a mighty god
[1:41:12] how many god do we have
[1:41:14] he oh israel the lord your god is
[1:41:18] your throne oh god
[1:41:21] is forever this son is god amen
[1:41:24] it's forever and ever a scepter of
[1:41:27] righteousness is the scepter of your
[1:41:29] kingdom
[1:41:31] you have love righteousness
[1:41:33] and hated iniquity
[1:41:35] therefore god
[1:41:38] god is talking to the son but he's
[1:41:40] telling him god
[1:41:44] everybody care
[1:41:45] therefore god even your god
[1:41:50] you see why you need a prophet who is
[1:41:52] god
[1:41:53] it looks like two people are talking and
[1:41:56] one is saying god
[1:41:58] god is talking to you god and god
[1:42:00] talking
[1:42:02] anybody here
[1:42:04] therefore god even your god everybody
[1:42:08] ready

[1:42:11] anointed you with the oil of gladness
[1:42:15] above your water

[1:42:27] everybody
[1:42:29] among those children a tribe was picked
[1:42:32] above the brother and in the spiritual
[1:42:35] we find a son but this son has his
[1:42:38] fellow

[1:44:21] shame
[1:44:23] you watching your scripture

[1:44:29] but here
[1:44:31] the sons of liver are you following me
[1:44:35] was pulling that from their brethren
[1:44:38] yet they were brothers
[1:44:40] in the spiritual we also have a brother
[1:44:44] amen
[1:44:45] amen but that brother is our god
[1:44:48] he is a husband
[1:44:50] he is a high priest he is a savior he is
[1:44:55] a redeemer he is everything to us
[1:44:59] [Applause]
[1:45:04] he's just anointed a little bit above us
[1:45:07] so we can pay him our taxes
[1:45:12] ever here
[1:45:14] ever here
[1:45:15] verse 12 saying i will declare your name
[1:45:19] to my
[1:45:21] in the midst of the water
[1:45:24] will i sing again your water
[1:45:26] so the church of the living god the body
[1:45:30] is the brother of this man
[1:45:32] [Music]
[1:45:36] we okay
[1:45:37] according to the natural seed
[1:45:40] there is a brother that is taken above
[1:45:43] the brother to receive tavern
[1:45:45] in the spiritual seed there is also a
[1:45:48] brother that is pulled above the brother
[1:45:52] [Music]
[1:45:54] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:45:56] everybody
[1:45:57] but he whose descent is not counted from
[1:46:01] them receive ties of abraham and bless
[1:46:04] him that had the promises
[1:46:06] and as i may say so leave her
[1:46:10] also who received have
[1:46:14] paid that in who
[1:46:18] [Music]
[1:46:21] abraham
[1:46:23] [Music]
[1:46:25] begot isaac
[1:46:28] do you see leave her there
[1:46:31] liv isaac begat jacob
[1:46:36] and jacob begat the third son which was
[1:46:40] liver
[1:46:41] everybody here
[1:46:42] but when abraham
[1:46:45] meet mercy zedek
[1:46:48] do you follow me
[1:46:49] instead of mercy zedek
[1:46:52] looking for isaac
[1:46:55] because as it was the direct son of
[1:46:57] abraham
[1:46:58] melchizedek
[1:47:00] when you meet him he doesn't go with the
[1:47:04] natural image
[1:47:11] do you follow me
[1:47:12] when you meet a jew
[1:47:14] the jew will go with your trouble paul
[1:47:17] from the tribe of benjamin a pharisee of
[1:47:20] the pharisee that's how it is when you
[1:47:22] reach melchizedek
[1:47:24] merchandise doesn't go by the natural
[1:47:27] image
[1:47:29] melchizedek work with predestination
[1:47:32] [Applause]
[1:47:38] do you follow me
[1:47:39] if you give mercy zedek
[1:47:42] is so and jacob
[1:47:45] here
[1:47:46] naturally speaking
[1:47:48] everybody clear everybody will give
[1:47:51] their birth right to esau
[1:47:53] because his son was born first
[1:47:56] but when he come to melchizedek
[1:47:59] when you give him his soul and jacob
[1:48:01] mercury said before they were born
[1:48:05] before they were conceived in the womb
[1:48:07] of the mother i love jacob
[1:48:10] and i hated his soul
[1:48:13] his son was not even born
[1:48:16] here so when abraham
[1:48:18] begin to pay tax to mercy
[1:48:21] merchandise searched the launch of
[1:48:23] abraham
[1:48:24] and took that target
[1:48:26] and said the one who paid have is river
[1:48:30] not isaac
[1:48:32] not jacob
[1:48:35] anybody here
[1:48:36] are you okay
[1:48:39] verse 10
[1:48:40] for he
[1:48:41] was yet in the launch of who
[1:48:46] was abraham the father of
[1:48:49] liver
[1:48:50] who was the father of liver
[1:48:53] how is he abraham now is the father of
[1:48:56] liver
[1:48:58] we okay now when you're handling
[1:49:01] melchizedek
[1:49:04] when you talk when you open the book of
[1:49:06] melchizedek
[1:49:07] do you follow me
[1:49:09] liver is a child of abraham
[1:49:12] jacob is a child of abraham
[1:49:14] isaac is a child of abraham
[1:49:17] you follow me when you go to the natural
[1:49:20] book of the lineage
[1:49:22] the son of abraham is isaac
[1:49:25] liver is a great great great son of
[1:49:29] abraham
[1:49:30] that's the natural seed but the
[1:49:33] spiritual seed
[1:49:34] all of this together
[1:49:37] but here
[1:49:38] they are children of abraham
[1:49:44] in the spiritual when you ask isaac who
[1:49:48] is your father abraham if you ask jacob
[1:49:51] who is your father abraham if you ask
[1:49:54] any jew
[1:49:55] who is your father
[1:49:58] the book of the generation of jesus
[1:50:00] christ is starred by who
[1:50:03] amen
[1:50:06] let's look at something here if it's
[1:50:08] going to help you
[1:50:09] in first corinthians chapter 4 verse 14
[1:50:13] the bible said i write not these things

[1:55:17] [Music]
[1:55:20] it's the giving of birth of men
[1:55:30] everybody here that's why brother

[1:55:58] the children is not your inheritance
[1:56:02] jacob
[1:56:04] this child doesn't belong to you
[1:56:07] ever here
[1:56:08] joseph went to egypt
[1:56:10] he gave birth to ephraim
[1:56:15] jacob came
[1:56:17] and he looked
[1:56:18] at
[1:56:19] joseph he said who are these children
[1:56:22] he said these are my children this is
[1:56:24] ephraim and manasseh
[1:56:26] amen he said pull them here so i can
[1:56:28] bless them
[1:56:29] when they're bringing the children
[1:56:31] suddenly when he shot his head he goes
[1:56:34] like this
[1:56:35] [Applause]
[1:56:35] [Music]
[1:56:37] ever here joseph said daddy that's not
[1:56:40] the case this is the oldest he said it
[1:56:43] is not me
[1:56:45] melchizedek is talking right now
[1:56:47] [Applause]
[1:56:50] i work here
[1:56:51] i am under melchizedek
[1:56:54] i am not going by the natural image
[1:56:57] according to the natural image you are
[1:56:59] right but according to melchizedek the
[1:57:02] first the younger one he's the one that
[1:57:05] is the first one
[1:57:06] and he crosses the hand and do you know
[1:57:09] what he said he said from today
[1:57:12] joseph
[1:57:13] these two children
[1:57:15] are no longer your children
[1:57:17] [Applause]
[1:57:19] i am no longer grandpa to these two
[1:57:22] when you see me you call me father
[1:57:27] and when you see your father joseph call
[1:57:30] him brother
[1:57:32] [Music]
[1:57:34] [Applause]
[1:57:35] that's why those two children became the
[1:57:39] tribe of israel
[1:57:42] they put them as a tribe because they
[1:57:45] became children of who jacob not by sex
[1:57:50] but by predestination
[1:57:53] [Applause]
[1:57:58] by natural birth they can never be the
[1:58:00] tribe of israel but by predestination
[1:58:04] they are the tribe of israel they open
[1:58:07] the door and say hey you get in here

[1:58:56] went to the sixth dimension brother
[1:58:58] branham said are these all problems
[1:59:03] they say they are not pronouns
[1:59:06] they are the people you preach the
[1:59:08] message

[2:02:16] but from god hour
[2:02:20] amen
[2:02:21] everybody okay so far so we understand
[2:02:24] now when we are dealing with melchizedek
[2:02:28] we are entering into the predestination
[2:02:32] ever here there is a fellow that is
[2:02:34] above his fellow
[2:02:36] verse 11 if therefore perfection were by
[2:02:39] the levitical priesthood
[2:02:42] what father need was there that another
[2:02:45] priest should rise after the order of
[2:02:47] melchizedek and not be called after the
[2:02:50] order of who
[2:02:52] there is two orders
[2:02:54] what happened really what's going on
[2:02:57] keep your seat belted
[2:02:59] when we are looking on the natural side
[2:03:02] are you okay
[2:03:03] are you ready
[2:03:05] when we look at the natural side
[2:03:08] god chose a nation called israel
[2:03:11] and pulled the nation out back here he
[2:03:15] said out of all the nation of the earth
[2:03:17] god look at the egyptian look at the
[2:03:19] syrian look at this look at this look at
[2:03:22] everybody he said out of all of this i'm
[2:03:25] choosing this one
[2:03:27] i pull israel and i'm going to use
[2:03:29] israel as an example
[2:03:32] to make all the nation of the world
[2:03:34] understand how i operate
[2:03:37] everybody here
[2:03:39] when he chose israel
[2:03:41] in exodus 19 the bible say
[2:03:44] now therefore if
[2:03:47] it's under condition
[2:03:49] [Music]
[2:03:51] in the natural seed
[2:03:53] it's conditional
[2:03:55] there is a condition
[2:03:57] if
[2:03:59] if
[2:04:00] ye
[2:04:01] will obey my voice indeed
[2:04:04] i will keep my covenant
[2:04:07] then you shall be a peculiar treasure
[2:04:10] unto me above
[2:04:13] for all the earth is water
[2:04:15] everybody here belongs to me but i pick
[2:04:18] you up
[2:04:18] there is a condition
[2:04:20] if you want me to lift you up above
[2:04:22] everybody
[2:04:23] you keep what i tell you
[2:04:25] anybody here
[2:04:26] and he shall be unto me a kingdom of
[2:04:30] water
[2:04:31] and a holy water
[2:04:33] these are the word which that shall
[2:04:35] speak unto the children of water
[2:04:37] so according to god when he was pulling
[2:04:40] the nation of israel he wants all of
[2:04:43] them to be priests under one condition
[2:04:46] you got to follow what i tell you
[2:04:48] if you don't follow what i tell you
[2:04:50] guess what
[2:04:51] i will take that priest off
[2:04:54] anybody here
[2:04:56] in the natural we continue
[2:04:59] then we found in exodus chapter 12
[2:05:01] verse 12 the bible say
[2:05:04] for i will pass through the land of
[2:05:06] egypt this night
[2:05:08] and will smite all the water
[2:05:11] why was god smiting only the firstborn

[2:05:46] both men
[2:05:48] and beast

[2:15:28] look at you he doesn't see your clothes
[2:15:31] he have like an x-ray machine
[2:15:33] when the prophet looked like this he

[2:15:47] was in a prophet
[2:15:50] [Music]

[2:15:54] when moses saw that the people were
[2:15:57] naked for aaron had made them naked
[2:16:01] unto their shame among their enemies
[2:16:04] then moses stood in the gate of the camp
[2:16:07] and said

[2:16:34] the invitation was given to everybody
[2:16:38] everybody
[2:16:39] everybody could raise their hand and say
[2:16:42] we are all in the lord's son for some
[2:16:45] reason not everybody moved

[2:17:17] didn't the son of rubin come
[2:17:20] for some reason
[2:17:21] something came on the liver
[2:17:24] maybe he was washing his dishes when
[2:17:26] moses spoke
[2:17:28] he just felt like the dishes fell down
[2:17:32] here
[2:17:33] maybe a liver was working on something
[2:17:36] when moses when the voice of the prophet
[2:17:39] spoke
[2:17:42] there was something in liver
[2:17:47] that just dropped
[2:17:49] and rose up and moved straight to moses
[2:17:53] and maybe when you look at the eyes
[2:17:56] the eyes changing
[2:17:59] maybe they were laughing and suddenly
[2:18:01] they turn around where is moses
[2:18:04] and they begin to go everybody here

[2:18:37] dreaming but liver is moving
[2:18:39] [Music]
[2:18:40] ever here
[2:18:42] it is predestination
[2:18:45] [Applause]
[2:18:46] that is no more than natural seed
[2:18:49] because all of them where the natural
[2:18:51] seed of abraham
[2:18:53] but liver move
[2:18:55] not by naturally stent
[2:18:58] [Music]
[2:19:02] brother branham said before the
[2:19:04] earthquake in india
[2:19:09] ever here
[2:19:11] this found out
[2:19:12] that all the animals
[2:19:15] suddenly were moving away from the wall
[2:19:19] and the human being was going in the war
[2:19:22] because nature never sinned
[2:19:25] he became subject to sin automatically
[2:19:28] because he was under man
[2:19:30] and when the earthquake came and began
[2:19:33] to kill the people
[2:19:35] the human being died
[2:19:37] but the animal was safe
[2:19:40] there was something in the animal that
[2:19:43] told them get away from the wall if you
[2:19:46] ask
[2:19:47] a a goat
[2:19:49] what is a wall
[2:19:51] the goat doesn't know he cannot even
[2:19:53] talk
[2:19:54] if you ask a chicken or a pig what is a
[2:19:57] wall he doesn't know but when
[2:20:01] danger is coming
[2:20:02] the chicken knows the difference between
[2:20:05] the world
[2:20:06] and being in a safe place
[2:20:09] nobody teaches the chicken
[2:20:11] nobody teaches the goat
[2:20:13] the god himself knows that this is a
[2:20:16] wall
[2:20:17] it is made out of wood
[2:20:19] this one is concrete this is the danger
[2:20:21] one and then he move out
[2:20:23] nobody taught him the difference between
[2:20:26] wood and concrete
[2:20:31] hallelujah
[2:20:32] brother branham said that is god in
[2:20:34] nature
[2:20:36] ever here
[2:20:38] and he said unto them
[2:20:40] that save the lord god of israel
[2:20:42] put every man his sword by his side
[2:20:46] the leaver came
[2:20:48] he said take your sword
[2:20:50] everybody
[2:20:54] next
[2:20:55] everybody
[2:20:56] and go in and out from the gate
[2:20:59] to get
[2:21:01] throughout the camp and slay every man
[2:21:04] in his water
[2:21:06] can you do that
[2:21:08] can you do that
[2:21:10] and slay every man in his water
[2:21:13] friend and every man is what
[2:21:18] anybody care
[2:21:20] what a commandment
[2:21:22] so if you were laughing with delivered
[2:21:26] you were his friend
[2:21:27] and you were talking about you know did
[2:21:29] you hear the news and everything when
[2:21:31] delivered leave and go to moses when
[2:21:34] he's coming
[2:21:35] he's gonna kill you
[2:21:41] hallelujah
[2:21:42] and the children of liver did according
[2:21:47] to the word of moses
[2:21:49] and their fear of the people that day
[2:21:52] about three thousand men
[2:21:56] no mercy leave i swear wait a minute i'm

[2:22:10] nobody else ever here
[2:22:13] for moses had said
[2:22:16] the truth about it
[2:22:18] consecrate yourself today
[2:22:20] to the lord even every man upon his son
[2:22:24] and upon his brother that he may bestow
[2:22:28] upon you a what
[2:22:31] so when moses was speaking moses who

[2:23:18] are we okay
[2:23:20] i'm letting that sink
[2:23:21] everybody
[2:23:23] so the purpose
[2:23:25] that god
[2:23:26] was claiming the firstborn
[2:23:30] was to give them the priesthood
[2:23:36] here
[2:23:38] and because of sin
[2:23:41] is so lost
[2:23:43] [Music]

[2:24:28] anybody here
[2:24:29] verse one
[2:24:30] now
[2:24:31] the sons of reuben
[2:24:34] the who
[2:24:35] the firstborn of whom
[2:24:38] the first child of jacob was robin
[2:24:41] hey back here
[2:24:42] for
[2:24:43] he was the firstborn
[2:24:46] but for as much as he defiled his
[2:24:50] father's very bed
[2:24:52] hey
[2:24:54] come on
[2:24:56] do you know what reuben did right
[2:24:59] jacob have another wife
[2:25:01] the bible called her a concubine
[2:25:05] you polygamist that's your problem
[2:25:08] anybody care
[2:25:10] i don't know i cannot emphasize how to
[2:25:12] tell people it's wrong
[2:25:14] ever here
[2:25:16] how many wife did jacob have
[2:25:19] four
[2:25:20] two concubine but if the first woman
[2:25:22] that they gave him was who
[2:25:25] lia
[2:25:26] the first child of leah was ruben
[2:25:29] the second the one that he loved was who
[2:25:32] who was the first child of russia
[2:25:36] the firstborn of leah was reuben
[2:25:39] firstborn
[2:25:40] and the firstborn of
[2:25:43] of rapture was who
[2:25:45] now let's read now the sons of ruben
[2:25:48] the firstborn of israel
[2:25:51] who is jacob for he was the firstborn
[2:25:54] but for as much as he defiled his
[2:25:57] father's bed
[2:25:58] his birthright was given to the sons of
[2:26:01] who
[2:26:02] joseph was the firstborn of
[2:26:05] he moved from the firstborn to the
[2:26:07] second firstborn
[2:26:10] you see that
[2:26:11] it was given to the sons of jacob
[2:26:14] they saw the the sons of joseph the son
[2:26:17] of israel and the genealogy
[2:26:20] and the genealogy is not to be reckoned
[2:26:23] after the water
[2:26:25] amen now let's go back here
[2:26:28] i have taken delivered from among the
[2:26:30] children of israel instead of all the
[2:26:34] first born that opened the matrix or the
[2:26:36] womb among the children of israel
[2:26:39] therefore the liver shall be
[2:26:43] he disqualified the firstborn
[2:26:45] and because of what liver did he say
[2:26:49] instead of the first born now from there
[2:26:51] on i switched to liver but that didn't
[2:26:54] happen by any chance
[2:26:56] because in the loans of abraham liver
[2:27:00] already paid out to who
[2:27:03] predestination will prevail ever here
[2:27:07] because all the first born our mind
[2:27:10] for all the day that are smart all the
[2:27:13] first born in the land of egypt
[2:27:15] are hallowed in other words are
[2:27:17] consecrated unto me all the first born
[2:27:20] in israel because they were slaying the
[2:27:23] lamb and the lamb was consecrating the
[2:27:26] firstborn of israel when you put the
[2:27:28] blood
[2:27:29] god already claimed your firstborn when
[2:27:31] you put the blood god claimed your
[2:27:33] firstborn so everybody that got the
[2:27:35] blood of the lamb was already claimed
[2:27:38] everybody
[2:27:39] i hallowed unto me all the firstborn in
[2:27:42] israel both men and women
[2:27:45] man shall there be i am the lord
[2:27:48] verse 40 and the lord said unto moses
[2:27:51] number or the firstborn of the man of
[2:27:54] the children of israel from a month old
[2:27:57] and upward and take the number of their
[2:27:59] name
[2:28:00] and that shall take delivered for me
[2:28:04] i am the lord instead of all the
[2:28:07] firstborn among the children of israel
[2:28:10] and the color of delivered instead of
[2:28:13] all the first links among the cattle of
[2:28:16] the children of water
[2:28:17] the consecration was to consecrate man
[2:28:20] and the beast god rejected the nation of
[2:28:23] israel he said i need the tribe of liver
[2:28:26] i want you to take all the firstborn and
[2:28:29] i want you to take all the firstborn of
[2:28:31] the animal of the liver not the other
[2:28:33] animal
[2:28:35] ever here
[2:28:37] we're heading somewhere blessed be the
[2:28:39] name of the lord in deuteronomy 10 the
[2:28:42] bible says wherefore liver had no part
[2:28:46] nor inheritance with his brethren god
[2:28:48] separated him
[2:28:50] the lord is his inheritance
[2:28:53] according us the lord that god promised
[2:28:56] him
[2:28:57] ever here

[2:29:36] the daughter of liver whom her mother
[2:29:40] dared to live in egypt and yoke bed
[2:29:43] bear
[2:29:45] unto aram who
[2:29:48] and who
[2:29:49] and who
[2:29:50] [Music]

[2:29:54] so
[2:29:55] out of the family of delivered
[2:29:58] god pulled horror
[2:30:01] and at the time of the exodus he found a
[2:30:05] family and he pulled moses out of it
[2:30:08] but moses was not the firstborn
[2:30:12] but here
[2:30:13] the firstborn of aaron was named who's
[2:30:16] who
[2:30:17] do you want a scripture
[2:30:19] it's in exodus 7 7.
[2:30:23] exodus chapter 7 verse 7.
[2:30:26] amen aaron was bigger was greater was
[2:30:30] older than moses
[2:30:31] the bible said aaron was 83 and moses
[2:30:34] was 80.
[2:30:36] everybody here so the firstborn of amram
[2:30:39] was
[2:30:40] aaron
[2:30:42] what did god do to air on
[2:30:44] them first born first of all first of
[2:30:47] all

[2:30:54] and present them before who
[2:30:57] and under who
[2:30:59] that they may minister unto him
[2:31:03] we okay now
[2:31:05] so
[2:31:05] israel rejected
[2:31:08] god picked the tribe of liver everybody
[2:31:11] but inside the tribe of liver because
[2:31:15] there is only one office
[2:31:17] you follow me
[2:31:18] it's about the office but here inside
[2:31:21] the tribe of liver
[2:31:23] god picked
[2:31:24] aaron
[2:31:26] and he said i need the house of aaron
[2:31:29] the firstborn of amran
[2:31:32] he's the priest
[2:31:34] remember the first high priest was who
[2:31:36] aaron ever here

[2:31:52] aaron
[2:31:54] back here there is a brother but there
[2:31:56] is a brother that goes higher
[2:31:59] and back here there is one brother that
[2:32:02] goes higher and the other remain but
[2:32:04] they are brother

[2:32:11] and they shall be in the charge of the
[2:32:14] whole congregation before the tabernacle
[2:32:16] of the congregation to do the service of
[2:32:18] the tabernacle and they shall keep all
[2:32:20] the instrument of the tabernacle of the
[2:32:23] congregation these are evil and the
[2:32:25] charge of the children of israel to do
[2:32:27] the service of the tabernacle and that

[2:33:03] even though the priests themselves are
[2:33:05] livered
[2:33:07] but here
[2:33:09] because the first man that saw the man
[2:33:11] falling on the road to jericho
[2:33:14] was a priest
[2:33:17] [Music]
[2:33:18] we okay now we okay now and the second
[2:33:22] man that saw him was there
[2:33:25] are we okay now
[2:33:27] my time is already up
[2:33:30] amen
[2:33:31] we okay though
[2:33:33] okay now that shall give delivered
[2:33:37] unto aaron and to his son remember that
[2:33:39] priesthood
[2:33:41] they are wholly given unto him out of
[2:33:45] the children of israel
[2:33:47] and that shall appoint aaron
[2:33:50] the high priest and his children the
[2:33:53] children of the high priest and his son
[2:33:55] and they shall wait on the priesthood
[2:33:58] so the office of the priest was given
[2:34:00] only to aaron and his children period
[2:34:04] all the other levat
[2:34:07] are helpers to iran
[2:34:09] and this entire one and two
[2:34:12] make what they call the levitical
[2:34:14] priesthood
[2:34:19] everybody here so when they say
[2:34:21] levitical priesthood they are priests
[2:34:24] who held the office and they are leaver
[2:34:27] that helped the priest
[2:34:30] amen
[2:34:31] but here so not all leave at a priest
[2:34:35] but all priests are livered
[2:34:39] you want me to
[2:34:41] decide again
[2:34:45] to be a priest you must be a leaver
[2:34:50] but to be a priest you must be a child
[2:34:52] of aaron
[2:34:54] make sense
[2:34:55] make sense
[2:34:57] but to work in the tabernacle all you
[2:34:59] have to be is a levator but to go into
[2:35:02] the holy place and the holy of holiest
[2:35:06] only aaron
[2:35:08] and his family
[2:35:10] back here so all priests are leaving
[2:35:14] but not all levites are priests
[2:35:17] the priests are only aaron and his
[2:35:20] family
[2:35:22] now your bible changed from today
[2:35:24] hey and that shall appoint aaron and his
[2:35:28] son and shall wait on the priest's
[2:35:30] office so on the natural side here
[2:35:34] we find out that there is the firstborn
[2:35:36] has been chosen
[2:35:38] and they have given them the preached
[2:35:40] office
[2:35:42] what happened in the spiritual side
[2:35:44] and maybe we can stop here because time
[2:35:47] is up everybody here
[2:35:50] before the deaf angel comes
[2:35:54] there must be a what
[2:35:56] a killing of the lamb
[2:36:00] anybody here
[2:36:02] revelation 13 verse 8
[2:36:05] and all that dwell upon the earth
[2:36:09] shall worship him
[2:36:11] whose name
[2:36:12] are not written
[2:36:14] in the book of life of who
[2:36:17] the lamb slain where
[2:36:23] so before you were born
[2:36:27] before you come to your mother
[2:36:30] before you travel from your great great
[2:36:34] great great great great great great
[2:36:36] great great great great father
[2:36:38] and right here
[2:36:40] a lamb
[2:36:42] was slain
[2:36:43] [Music]
[2:36:45] before they even created the earth
[2:36:49] before they created anything
[2:36:52] before they even talk about you here
[2:36:56] there was another name
[2:36:58] not a natural lamb but there was a
[2:37:01] spiritual lamb
[2:37:03] that was slain
[2:37:05] in the mind of god
[2:37:07] before the foundation of the world
[2:37:12] but here
[2:37:13] because the levitical priesthood was
[2:37:16] only a reflection of the tree priesthood
[2:37:20] which was the melchizedek episode
[2:37:24] and if the blood was shed under the
[2:37:28] levitical priesthood we need also the
[2:37:31] blood
[2:37:32] not the human blood but the blood of god
[2:37:35] himself
[2:37:37] a bloodbath
[2:37:40] must be also shed
[2:37:43] for the spiritual seed
[2:37:48] and when the blood is shed
[2:37:50] he consecrates the firstborn
[2:37:54] who is the firstborn
[2:37:57] amen
[2:37:58] hallelujah
[2:38:00] for unto
[2:38:02] which of the angel
[2:38:03] said he at any time
[2:38:06] die out my son
[2:38:08] this day have water
[2:38:11] and again i won't be to him here
[2:38:14] and he shall be to me air
[2:38:17] and again when he bringing the first one
[2:38:21] into the water
[2:38:23] and he said let all the angel of god do
[2:38:26] whatever
[2:38:28] so we also have a first born
[2:38:31] [Music]
[2:38:34] and right here
[2:38:36] colossians 1
[2:38:38] 14 in whom we have redemption through
[2:38:42] his water
[2:38:43] the lamb even the forgiveness of water
[2:38:47] who is the image of the invisible god
[2:38:50] the what
[2:38:52] of what
[2:38:53] [Music]
[2:38:57] the priesthood was given to the
[2:38:59] firstborn
[2:39:01] you are a priest for heaven
[2:39:03] under the order of who
[2:39:06] he must be given to the firstborn
[2:39:11] hallelujah
[2:39:13] revelation 30. i'm going to stop
[2:39:15] somewhere here
[2:39:16] and until the angel of the church of
[2:39:18] what
[2:39:20] why now this year

[2:39:25] why not smear now why not pregnancy the
[2:39:29] bible says right this feeds the water
[2:39:33] the finality
[2:39:35] the faithful and the true water the
[2:39:38] water
[2:39:39] of the water
[2:39:41] i thought god already created
[2:39:48] do you follow me i thought god already
[2:39:51] created everything
[2:39:53] and on the seventh day god did what
[2:39:57] he rested because everything was water
[2:40:00] but why is he created what is he
[2:40:02] creating again
[2:40:11] he is standing in the midst of the
[2:40:14] church
[2:40:14] as he stand there revealing who he is
[2:40:19] is in this last stage

[2:40:50] multiplication was by sex
[2:40:53] but this is a new creation
[2:40:59] this has to do with that
[2:41:03] this is a special
[2:41:05] designation of himself
[2:41:09] he is the creator of that
[2:41:13] [Music]
[2:41:15] they have a new blood groom
[2:41:17] [Music]

[2:47:23] break you and take the same and start
[2:47:25] over again
[2:47:27] that's nothing

[2:48:44] it is new creation it is another
[2:48:47] creation distinct
[2:48:50] from the old one
[2:48:52] no longer is he dealing by waves of
[2:48:55] water he have nothing to do with sex
[2:48:58] anymore it's another multiplication it's
[2:49:02] another breath
[2:49:03] [Music]
[2:49:06] that was how he dealt with israel in the
[2:49:10] nature he chose abraham in the nature
[2:49:13] and of abraham issued through uh you
[2:49:16] know from abraham issue through the
[2:49:18] godly as a clan natural but now

[2:49:31] it's a purpose in melchizedek he's the
[2:49:35] first of that creation he was god
[2:49:39] created in the form of what
[2:49:46] when they created jesus christ
[2:49:49] they bypassed sex
[2:49:52] because that's the serpentine so if the
[2:49:55] first one is created without sex
[2:49:58] every child that come from him
[2:50:01] will come with that sex
[2:50:03] [Music]
[2:50:04] [Applause]

[2:50:09] creating water
[2:50:12] unto himself god the creator created
[2:50:15] himself a part of his creation this is
[2:50:19] the true revelation of god this was his
[2:50:23] water
[2:50:24] this purpose took form through what
[2:50:28] i love jacob i hated his song

[2:50:49] and innumerable company of angel
[2:50:52] to the general water
[2:50:55] of the church of who
[2:50:58] [Applause]
[2:51:00] [Music]
[2:51:02] so the firstborn have a church
[2:51:04] [Music]
[2:51:06] and that church is his bread
[2:51:09] that's why on calvary
[2:51:11] the peace him on his side
[2:51:14] like the priests adam because he is the
[2:51:17] second adam
[2:51:19] and he must give breath
[2:51:21] that's why when the prism
[2:51:23] water and blood came out

[2:51:30] because he's buffing his ears
[2:51:36] let's stand

[2:51:41] let's stand here
[2:51:42] [Applause]
[2:51:45] let's stand here
[2:51:49] why did water and
[2:51:50] blood came up together
[2:51:57] to the general assembly to the church of
[2:52:00] the water
[2:52:02] which are written where
[2:52:05] which are written where
[2:52:07] which book do have the name of the
[2:52:09] people
[2:52:11] the book of life
[2:52:13] this church is written in the lamb's
[2:52:15] book of life which is written in heaven
[2:52:18] and to god the water
[2:52:22] the cloud
[2:52:23] and to the spirit of just man-made water
[2:52:29] take galatians for
[2:52:32] hallelujah
[2:52:34] don't want to linger here
[2:52:39] brother david you will call this part
[2:52:40] one
[2:52:44] take galatians 4
[2:52:46] and we can pray
[2:52:50] hallelujah
[2:52:52] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:52:55] take galatians 4
[2:52:58] you there
[2:53:00] you there
[2:53:02] go to verse 22
[2:53:04] are you there
[2:53:08] so it is written
[2:53:10] that abraham
[2:53:12] had water
[2:53:14] the one by water
[2:53:17] and the other by water
[2:53:20] but he
[2:53:21] who
[2:53:22] was of the bound woman was born after
[2:53:26] the water
[2:53:28] that's ismail
[2:53:30] it's a desire of sex
[2:53:32] but he of the fruit with the free woman
[2:53:35] was born by water
[2:53:37] isaac was a promise
[2:53:40] ever here
[2:53:42] everybody
[2:53:43] verse 24 which things are an allegory in
[2:53:48] other words it was a tap
[2:53:51] it was just a shadow
[2:53:52] god was giving a message yes that's
[2:53:55] right everybody here it was our allegory
[2:53:58] for these are the two covenant
[2:54:02] so when you're reading you're reading a
[2:54:04] story but actually it's not a story
[2:54:05] you're reading two covenant these are
[2:54:08] two covenants the one from mount sana
[2:54:11] where they lock him
[2:54:13] which gender the bondage because the law
[2:54:15] put us in prison
[2:54:17] which is who edgar the son of ishmael
[2:54:21] the mother of ishmael for this edgar is
[2:54:25] mount sana
[2:54:26] in arabia
[2:54:28] and answers to jerusalem which is now
[2:54:32] the jews and he's in bondage with her
[2:54:35] children
[2:54:36] in other words ishmael
[2:54:39] represented the jews today
[2:54:41] which are of ego
[2:54:45] so if ishmael represented the jews that
[2:54:48] we are afraid of
[2:54:50] who is now isaac
[2:54:52] everybody here
[2:54:54] verse 26 but jerusalem which is where
[2:55:01] if there is a jerusalem above
[2:55:04] that jerusalem this jerusalem have a
[2:55:07] king
[2:55:09] if there is a jerusalem above the
[2:55:11] jerusalem above must have also a king
[2:55:15] and what is that name of that king
[2:55:18] melchizede the king of water
[2:55:21] selem which is water
[2:55:23] in other words there is another
[2:55:25] seed that comes from melchizedek
[2:55:32] jerusalem which is above is what
[2:55:35] you see
[2:55:36] is free
[2:55:38] which is the water
[2:55:40] do you see your mama
[2:55:43] do you see your mama
[2:55:44] do you see your mama
[2:55:46] so when you are giving birth by the new
[2:55:48] birth
[2:55:49] the one who delivered you
[2:55:53] your mother is up there
[2:55:55] and the king over there the father is
[2:55:58] melchizedek
[2:56:00] in other words when you are born that's
[2:56:02] why you heard jesus saying
[2:56:05] when a sinner come to repentance what
[2:56:07] happened over there
[2:56:09] what happened over there what happened
[2:56:12] over there
[2:56:14] joy
[2:56:15] joy where
[2:56:16] in other words there is a party of you
[2:56:18] in heaven
[2:56:19] they are singing and dancing in heaven
[2:56:22] when you are born over there the
[2:56:24] jerusalem your mother in heaven
[2:56:32] keep this we will continue on this
[2:56:34] because if i continue things continue to
[2:56:36] come up let's pray
[2:56:38] heavenly father
[2:56:40] lord we thank you
[2:56:42] i again father for your grace
[2:56:45] your love your mercy
[2:56:46] father and for everything
[2:56:48] you are still and have been doing for us
[2:56:51] lord everything that was in tapper
[2:56:54] we are now the reality we are the
[2:56:57] anti-top of those things lord
[2:57:00] now we understand why
[2:57:02] you could lay everything in your glory
[2:57:06] because you are looking for a special
[2:57:08] species
[2:57:09] we can understand why
[2:57:11] father you say father not my will but
[2:57:14] that will because when you look through
[2:57:17] the time
[2:57:18] you saw us
[2:57:19] you saw your children lord and father
[2:57:22] you were ready to lay everything to be
[2:57:25] stripped by human being and to accept
[2:57:28] lord father to die a death of a sinner
[2:57:31] because you knew that through that death
[2:57:34] he was only going through birth pain
[2:57:36] because you are giving birth
[2:57:38] to a child to your own brother just like
[2:57:42] adam because you didn't want to be
[2:57:44] lonely anymore
[2:57:45] father may we understand who we are may
[2:57:49] we understand lord father the revelation
[2:57:53] no wonder paul could say how great this
[2:57:55] man melchizedek is may lord father the
[2:57:59] church catch the revelation on who they
[2:58:02] really are not by the natural image not
[2:58:06] by their birth
[2:58:08] not even by the family they were birthed
[2:58:11] here under the earth because we could
[2:58:13] hear your prophet saying that i'm no
[2:58:15] longer the child of ella and charles
[2:58:18] branham it's not that he was rejecting
[2:58:21] his earthly parent but father you
[2:58:23] brought him to a higher revelation to
[2:58:26] understand that the earthly parent were
[2:58:28] not truly his parent their true parent
[2:58:32] was the one that started with us from
[2:58:34] before the foundation of the world when
[2:58:37] you were laying the foundation of the
[2:58:39] world and the sons of god was shouting
[2:58:42] for glory father we were there with you
[2:58:45] and we were eternal in your thought and
[2:58:47] may we understand that there is nothing
[2:58:50] that can step there is no death there is
[2:58:52] no height there is nothing that can
[2:58:54] separate us from the love of god which
[2:58:57] is in jesus christ because we are we
[2:59:00] have been sparse we are the bride of the
[2:59:03] very living god and we came out from the
[2:59:06] very launch of god not again by sex but
[2:59:10] it's a spiritual multiplication that can
[2:59:13] never be defiled again where we know
[2:59:15] lord father that we're gonna reach
[2:59:17] perfection for certainty because you who
[2:59:20] start the work you will finish it until
[2:59:23] the day of jesus christ lord we thank
[2:59:25] you for the grace that i have been given
[2:59:28] to even move to this time father i know
[2:59:30] time went to lord be upload but i thank
[2:59:33] you for the sacrifice you given to your
[2:59:35] children to bear up to this time lord
[2:59:38] may you continue with them father
[2:59:40] continue to open up this world beyond
[2:59:42] what was spoken here so that that can
[2:59:45] get a grasp and the people will begin to
[2:59:48] understand
[2:59:49] how to behave because they're coming
[2:59:52] from a different world just like the
[2:59:54] slave even though he was in a different
[2:59:56] land he could behave differently because
[2:59:59] he understood what he came where he came
[3:00:01] from may this church father and whoever
[3:00:04] he's gonna listen to this letter may
[3:00:07] they be realized father who they are and
[3:00:10] from there on all the christmas will be
[3:00:12] dropping all the the the drinking all
[3:00:15] the smoking everything else will begin
[3:00:18] to drop because they will realize that
[3:00:20] there is a father that is greater than
[3:00:23] we think and like the prodigal son may
[3:00:26] the one that is out of the way can drop
[3:00:28] everything and begin to come back to the
[3:00:30] house knowing lord father that in my
[3:00:33] father house even the servant are living
[3:00:35] better than what i'm living here even
[3:00:38] lord father lord the servants that are
[3:00:40] there are sleeping in a better place
[3:00:42] than we are and father you spoke to us
[3:00:44] that angel our servant lord but we are
[3:00:47] not servant we are higher than ange lord
[3:00:50] and what about if we come back from home
[3:00:53] what privilege what is a wedding out by
[3:00:56] the wedding band of marriage lord father
[3:00:58] reminding us that our position was never
[3:01:01] lost because you spoke in your word
[3:01:03] that's all that the father have given
[3:01:05] you you have lost none of them father we
[3:01:08] ask you and commit everything unto the
[3:01:10] hand if somebody's sick this morning
[3:01:12] father may you touch them and heal them
[3:01:15] if somebody's struggling lord you're the
[3:01:17] high priest lord that can be touched by
[3:01:19] the feeling of the infirmity may you
[3:01:22] touch them and heal them as we commit
[3:01:24] them unto the hand in jesus precious
