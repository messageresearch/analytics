[20:21] we vacated everything from our being
[20:24] outside of you and your word Lord
[20:26] we're here to meet with you father as
[20:28] you met with us in the Garden of Eden
[20:30] when you come down the cool of the
[20:32] evening of father and you'd ask us how
[20:34] was your day
[20:35] and we would tell you how nice it was to
[20:37] walk with Leo the Lion and how pretty
[20:39] the flowers were and the sisters may not
[20:42] have liked the arrangement just like
[20:44] that the way it was so they would speak
[20:45] to it and say just move over here and
[20:48] and and grow right here and they would
[20:50] do it they would just do it and then the
[20:52] one flower would be leaning a little bit
[20:53] this way and they say no no no you lean
[20:55] back this way and and it would do it
[20:58] Lord this is a reality
[21:01] we're coming to know by the revelation
[21:03] of the word Who We Are
[21:04] and we're so thankful Lord God that you
[21:07] determined in your mind that we would be
[21:11] with you in the end you're the one that
[21:13] said all the father has given me will
[21:15] come you're the one lord said that you
[21:18] wouldn't lose a one of them
[21:20] father it's not by my it's not by power
[21:23] it's by your spirits saith the Lord
[21:27] father we know that your word is truth
[21:29] and you've come to speak to us in the
[21:32] word of Truth this morning which is
[21:34] spirit and it is life Saint John 6 63
[21:37] Lords father we so grateful to you Lord
[21:40] God to think that you've lifted us up
[21:43] out of this Murray clay and put us on a
[21:45] rock of Revelation Lord never to be
[21:47] moved again
[21:48] never to be despondent never to be in
[21:51] despair
[21:52] always have a joy and a heart a song on
[21:54] our lips father and it's all because of
[21:57] you father and we're here to cry worthy
[22:00] and we're here to thank you Lord for
[22:01] healing our brother Lord who is long
[22:04] time served you father and now is in
[22:06] need of a healing touch but Lord there's
[22:08] nothing too difficult for you Lord we
[22:10] claim it done in the name of Jesus
[22:12] Christ as your bride and the authority
[22:15] that invested Us by the Kingdom of
[22:17] Heaven father we Proclaim it healed
[22:20] father we believe it Lord that's what
[22:22] believers do as they believe father and
[22:25] Lord for the for for those that are the
[22:27] mourning the loss of loved ones father
[22:29] or every one of us have lost loved ones
[22:30] we know it is what it is to mourn but
[22:34] father as your children we have a
[22:36] promise that you would comfort all that
[22:39] mourn
[22:40] father he was the one that told us to
[22:42] lift up our hands to hang down
[22:44] Lord Jesus and we want to remember
[22:46] Sister Lillian and brother Zach
[22:51] oh my
[22:52] one of the the very first institution
[22:55] that was ever instituted in the Bible
[22:57] was marriage and they're going to
[22:59] experience that today as brother Charles
[23:02] and sister Kayla did yesterday what a
[23:05] beautiful atmosphere
[23:07] oh what a joy Lauren to see Lord God how
[23:11] you've lifted them and placed them into
[23:13] a body Lord Jesus the invisible Union
[23:17] Lord and by this Lord Jesus will all men
[23:20] know that you're my disciples that you
[23:23] have a loved one for another
[23:25] and Lord God the thing that we need
[23:26] healing of more than anything else is
[23:29] our soul
[23:30] and that comes by the hearing of the
[23:32] word father it comes by Revelation and
[23:36] so father we just pray that you'll give
[23:38] us an ear to hear this morning the
[23:40] things that the spirit would speak to
[23:43] our soul lord that we can grow Lord God
[23:47] because we're going to shed these
[23:49] Earthly temples soon anyways but father
[23:51] if the same spirit that raised up Christ
[23:54] from the dead dwell in us then he who
[23:58] quickened that mortal body will Quicken
[24:02] our mortal Body by The Same Spirit that
[24:06] dwells
[24:08] this is a reality Lord and so father we
[24:12] come not to hear a man this morning but
[24:14] we come to hear you we pray that you'll
[24:16] bless him anoint him let him speak what
[24:20] you would have us to hear and let our
[24:23] hungry Hearts pull on the gift of God
[24:25] lord may not one Soul go out of here
[24:27] hungry this morning Father and we do
[24:30] know by the anointed prophet of this age
[24:32] that we who came in cannot leave the
[24:36] same way we came in we'll either go out
[24:38] be closer to you or further away that's

[45:13] amen glory to God and he's getting very
[45:17] very good you need to listen to the
[45:19] sermon he will wake you up
[45:22] [Laughter]
[45:24] glory to God one more thing I know there
[45:28] are people waiting for counseling that I
[45:30] need to talk to there was a question
[45:34] that was uh brought to me about when are
[45:36] we going to have the marriage uh married
[45:39] people uh meeting I already have seven
[45:43] questions
[45:44] so just give me some time we need the
[45:46] orchestrate everything and make sure all
[45:49] is well amen when I say the last Sunday
[45:52] that I can close the door there and
[45:55] close the door here and handle it I'm
[45:57] not talking about whooping people
[46:00] we cannot whoop you
[46:03] you know my heart amen because I've seen
[46:07] a lot
[46:08] in the message
[46:09] I've seen a lot of abuses
[46:12] and if there is something I cannot stand
[46:14] it's when children and women are abused
[46:18] I cannot stand that and usually they put
[46:21] it under the pretense of the message
[46:24] when brother Branham didn't preach it
[46:26] like that
[46:27] amen they will say the woman the woman
[46:29] the woman the woman the by-product and
[46:31] stuff like we corrected many of those
[46:33] stuff brother Branham was not talking
[46:35] about the things the way they were
[46:37] presented and when they are presented
[46:39] wrong people will take that wrong
[46:41] teaching and then begin to either abuse
[46:43] the husband or abuse the wife or abuse
[46:46] the children and I cannot stand that
[46:48] amen so when I say that I need to sit
[46:51] and talk to the married people is to
[46:53] iron certain things and make sure
[46:55] everything is clear and we understand
[46:57] one another better because we under a
[47:00] channel that we are dealing now where
[47:02] God is male and female so you need to
[47:05] know if you're hitting your wife you're
[47:07] just destroying yourself and we don't
[47:09] even believe in Believers hitting their
[47:11] wives
[47:12] amen that's not even to be Christian
[47:22] are you awake
[47:27] if you think that's not the case go
[47:30] ahead and try make sure they don't call
[47:32] me
[47:35] make sure they don't call me
[47:38] amen because I won't take your side
[47:42] regardless
[47:44] of what damage was caused I won't take
[47:46] your side
[47:49] amen
[47:54] any way everything is good thank you
[47:58] brother Kalima for the song and brother
[48:00] delario everything went special so
[48:03] remember I'm gonna go a different
[48:05] direction with this
[48:07] we're still under the same thought
[48:09] stay tight
[48:11] everything is okay if I use this as a
[48:14] reference in the future
[48:16] a man down the road I will put on the
[48:19] church chat
[48:21] group I will load quotes
[48:25] there for every member of this church to
[48:29] have it for reference
[48:31] amen so whenever you're talking to
[48:33] somebody or you're hearing something you
[48:36] don't have to call me or you don't have
[48:38] to go online and search for it you're
[48:40] going to have it so it's going to be
[48:41] your responsibility to take those court
[48:43] and to keep it somewhere and keep it
[48:46] handy because it's very very very
[48:49] important so if you are behind on the
[48:52] counseling we have not met yet or I have
[48:54] not responded to your email yet or to
[48:56] your text yet or to your phone call yet
[48:59] I had a very busy loaded weekend if I
[49:02] tell you what the devil is throwing on
[49:04] my way you will even be surprised for me
[49:07] sending right here amen so those that
[49:10] are international I see email coming up
[49:12] but I cannot open them and deal with
[49:16] them amen because I have certain things
[49:19] so you be patient sometimes I say prayer
[49:22] I say Lord help whoever is struggling
[49:24] because I do not have time to go through
[49:26] an email in detail and most of the time
[49:29] I cannot respond quicker to certain
[49:32] question because we under a divine order
[49:36] amen we don't act like Pentecostal
[49:41] we don't get a weapon and start shooting
[49:44] left and right that's not the ministry
[49:46] of brother Branham amen could line up
[49:50] people
[49:51] Billy Graham could line up people oral
[49:53] Robert they could line the people up and
[49:55] bring them up and just pray and move
[49:57] forward that was not the ministry of
[49:58] brother Branham amen the ministry of
[50:01] brother Branham you need to know what is
[50:03] the very cause
[50:05] is
[50:06] and the Very source of the problem amen
[50:09] if not you will pray for somebody they
[50:12] will feel better in the presence of the
[50:14] anointing but as soon as they leave the
[50:17] anointing the demon come back again
[50:19] amen and that's what we've seen over in
[50:22] the message young people being prayed
[50:23] for therefore being prayed for the fall
[50:26] being prayed for therefore and we keep
[50:28] doing the same thing no if we pray three
[50:31] times it's not working we need to sit
[50:33] down
[50:36] can you give me more microphone so I
[50:38] don't worry about who says a man give me
[50:40] more volume amen amen
[50:43] so we don't have to wait for who's doing
[50:46] what uh who's doing whatever
[50:50] amen so the ministry of brother Branham
[50:52] you need to find the cause of the
[50:55] disease
[50:56] just like you go a good doctor just
[50:58] doesn't see you and gives you a
[51:00] prescription and hand it to you you go
[51:02] back
[51:03] sometimes it won't work we need to do
[51:06] the diagnosis
[51:07] to find out what is causing this
[51:10] repression
[51:11] what is causing this problem and most of
[51:14] the time when You Dig Down Deeper it is
[51:18] not what you see
[51:19] it is something way down sometimes that
[51:23] happen in the childhood that you have to
[51:26] pick it up from there and once you serve
[51:29] it everything else is gone
[51:34] the way the intelligence goes to war now
[51:37] they send a drone
[51:40] and the John is working
[51:42] so when you ask me question and I don't
[51:45] answer you quickly I have just
[51:47] dispatched the spiritual drone
[51:50] they are still retrieving information
[51:52] for me and once I get the information
[51:54] pretty good I have the target zeroed in
[51:58] and nowhere to shoot when I shoot one
[52:01] time I'm shooting to kill
[52:04] [Applause]
[52:05] you
[52:07] everybody okay so far
[52:10] do you remember how long Paul was having
[52:12] a woman talking following them
[52:15] why didn't Paul turn around and say I
[52:17] rebuked you
[52:20] Paul left that woman keep following them
[52:22] and keep talking and keep talking the
[52:25] woman did not know that the spiritual
[52:27] drone were already dispatched they were
[52:30] studying the disease they were studying
[52:32] the condition when they had called they
[52:34] got everything zeroed in they pushed the
[52:36] button they say Paul go ahead and shoot
[52:38] it
[52:39] amen when he gathered that was it
[52:43] and do you know what kind of spirit was
[52:45] it
[52:45] he was a big snake
[52:47] he was a person but what the python was
[52:51] speaking was true
[52:56] he was saying these are the servant of
[52:58] the Living God
[52:59] that was right but it was a demonic
[53:02] spirit
[53:04] So speaking good things doesn't make
[53:09] doesn't tell us it's coming from God
[53:11] [Applause]
[53:16] amen amen
[53:20] I get among minister they ask me
[53:22] questions and I know what they're trying
[53:24] to say because the Drone is already
[53:25] getting them
[53:29] [Music]
[53:30] one look at me he said were you in
[53:32] Commons church and I know where he was
[53:35] coming from
[53:39] I say brother I never seen the brother
[53:42] I've never been in his church I only
[53:44] heard about him he thought I was under
[53:47] the Thunder movement
[53:51] he didn't know that John got it and it's
[53:53] a Minister doing that and I know what
[53:56] they're talking
[54:00] I'm just waiting for the signal when I
[54:04] was shooting
[54:12] let's go to Joshua chapter 4.
[54:17] no you might be seated still I'm sorry
[54:20] this is not what we're reading this is
[54:22] something different
[54:26] so I don't know which direction I'm
[54:28] going
[54:30] amen
[54:32] amen
[54:34] Joshua chapter four if you're there you
[54:37] can say Amen
[54:39] verse 5. we dealt with it before we talk
[54:43] about the seal evidence and the open
[54:45] evidence and I'm begging you
[54:49] stay up
[54:51] okay
[54:52] we cannot continue to repeat over and
[54:54] over
[54:56] okay
[54:58] amen
[55:00] verse 4.
[55:02] you know this is pretty good
[55:04] then Joshua called the 12 men
[55:07] whom he had prepared you know that
[55:10] of the children of Israel Joshua chapter
[55:12] 4.
[55:14] out of every tribe and Joshua said to
[55:17] them pass over before the Ark of the
[55:20] Lord your God into the midst of Jordan
[55:23] everybody remember this
[55:25] and take you up every man of you a stone
[55:29] upon his shoulder according to the
[55:32] number of the tribe of the children of
[55:34] Israel
[55:36] that this may be a water
[55:38] yes my brother you can start now that
[55:41] this can be as water sign a son among
[55:45] you when they say a son
[55:48] it means a memorial
[55:52] amen
[55:54] they want this to be a son
[55:57] or a memorial
[56:00] a memorial for what
[56:04] a sound for what
[56:07] amen verse 6 that this may be a son
[56:11] among you
[56:13] so when you go to Israel the head signs
[56:18] everybody okay
[56:20] nobody have seen the stone of the Jordan
[56:24] before
[56:25] right they probably heard stories that
[56:27] they are down deep this River we got
[56:30] stoned but nobody's seen it
[56:33] so for some reason God separated and
[56:36] opened the water of the Jordan when God
[56:38] did it they went to pick up the stone
[56:41] and they brought something that was
[56:42] hidden
[56:45] are you following me are you following
[56:47] me something that was hidden before was
[56:50] brought up to the surface so that the
[56:52] naked eye can see it at the beginning
[56:55] you can look through Jordan but you
[56:58] won't see anything
[57:01] everybody here so the evidence that was
[57:04] sealed oh the invisible evidence of
[57:08] Jordan was picking up and put outside as
[57:12] a son
[57:13] and a memorial
[57:15] [Music]
[57:17] so if you never seen Jordan
[57:21] in the Deep you don't have to go down
[57:24] there
[57:25] there is a dividend that you can look up
[57:28] and say this came from Jordan everybody
[57:31] okay
[57:32] glory to God
[57:34] verse 6 that this may be a son among you
[57:38] that when your children
[57:41] ask their fathers in terms to water in
[57:46] other words the generation that I have
[57:48] seen that will die
[57:50] amen
[57:52] but we want to live in evidence
[57:58] so that they all come in New Generation
[58:00] even though they were not there when the
[58:03] things happened they can look at
[58:06] something and know that this is a
[58:09] reference to what our father spoke to us
[58:13] amen
[58:16] use this sermon today as your reference
[58:19] for this church
[58:21] everybody okay
[58:23] the Bible continue he says saying what
[58:27] mean you by water still stones so the
[58:30] stone will be there
[58:32] so one of these things the children will
[58:35] come and say Daddy
[58:37] what is this
[58:39] so there is a story behind the story
[58:43] everybody okay
[58:45] verse 7 then you shall answer them that
[58:49] the waters
[58:51] of Jordan were cut off
[58:54] before the Ark of the Covenant of the
[58:57] Lord when he passed over Jordan the
[59:00] Waters of Jordan were cut off and this
[59:03] Stone shall be for a water Memorial a
[59:06] memorial that the children of Israel
[59:08] forever
[59:10] to the children of Israel forever
[59:13] and the children of Israel did so as
[59:16] Joshua commanded and took up to of stone
[59:19] out of the midst of Jordan as the Lord
[59:22] spoke to Joshua according to the number
[59:24] of the tribe of the children of Israel
[59:26] and carry them over with them to the
[59:29] place where the lodge and lay them down
[59:32] there and Joshua set up 12 stone in the
[59:35] midst of Jordan you know what this means
[59:36] in the place where the feet of the
[59:38] priests which bore the Ark of the
[59:40] Covenant stood they are there to this
[59:43] day in other words when something
[59:45] happened
[59:47] amen amen God gave him a memorial
[59:50] and that Memorial will not was not for
[59:53] that generation only
[59:55] he was for that generation and the
[59:58] generation to come
[1:00:03] why are you saying all of this
[1:00:07] somebody gave me two pictures
[1:00:10] for this church
[1:00:12] as a gift
[1:00:14] and those picture has been here in my
[1:00:17] office for a long time
[1:00:19] and we never put them up
[1:00:22] the person even reminded me quite some
[1:00:25] time and sometimes I don't do things
[1:00:28] just like that I have to wait for the
[1:00:30] signal from the boss to tell me what to
[1:00:33] move because these are the children of
[1:00:35] God
[1:00:36] amen I don't want a person directing me
[1:00:40] I want God in that person directing me
[1:00:44] in other words not you but God in you
[1:00:47] speaking to me and I know how to
[1:00:49] recognize God in you
[1:00:51] amen amen
[1:00:53] so when brother Andrew Glover preached
[1:00:56] here
[1:00:57] he mentioned about those pictures
[1:00:59] [Music]
[1:01:01] and when he mentioned personally I got
[1:01:04] my signal

[1:09:09] it is the picture of his son
[1:09:13] amen
[1:09:14] so when they ask you why do you keep
[1:09:17] this picture on your church
[1:09:24] what is the purpose of of us cherishing
[1:09:27] this picture because brother Branham has
[1:09:30] a ladder picture
[1:09:31] we don't put them in our church
[1:09:35] there is a lot of picture in brother
[1:09:38] Branham album
[1:09:39] go ask his family they have another
[1:09:41] picture but we don't need this picture
[1:09:44] we only need this one why do we need
[1:09:48] that picture
[1:09:50] it is not the picture of brother Branham
[1:09:53] [Applause]
[1:09:57] are you following me
[1:09:59] because brother Branham himself says
[1:10:02] that it's the picture of his son what is
[1:10:06] brother Brian I'm doing in the picture
[1:10:08] of his son
[1:10:11] he said that one one night at Houston
[1:10:14] Texas God permitted his picture of his
[1:10:17] water son in the same form Saint Paul
[1:10:22] sent him to be water photographed and
[1:10:25] God George G Lacey of the FBI
[1:10:28] fingerprint and document to come from
[1:10:30] California to Houston Texas to put it
[1:10:34] into the shell building into the map
[1:10:38] God you're somebody who was criticizing
[1:10:41] brother Branham firmly
[1:10:45] [Music]
[1:10:47] in other words you who hate brother
[1:10:49] Branham come right here and look at this
[1:10:53] picture so in other words when a Critic
[1:10:55] look at you they look at you to find a
[1:10:59] fault so that they can disqualify you
[1:11:05] everybody okay
[1:11:07] glory to God he said and shook my hand
[1:11:11] and say water brother the light did
[1:11:14] water he was water yeah he said the
[1:11:17] mechanical eye of this camera won't take
[1:11:20] water then light was water in other
[1:11:24] words that really confirm that the light
[1:11:28] was water
[1:11:29] he didn't confirm brother Branham was
[1:11:32] there
[1:11:34] the problem was not brother partner the
[1:11:37] problem was the light on the picture
[1:11:43] do you follow me do you follow me the
[1:11:47] man already knew brother Branham the
[1:11:49] problem was not to to vindicate brother
[1:11:51] Branham it is to vindicate the owner of
[1:11:55] the picture
[1:11:55] [Applause]
[1:11:59] if you knew in the message pay attention
[1:12:03] everybody okay brother Branham say our
[1:12:05] heavenly father we thank you for your
[1:12:08] mercy oh God May the people just with us
[1:12:11] they are in the same order angel that
[1:12:15] led them in the water natural is leading
[1:12:18] us water in the water here is the water
[1:12:22] even the scientific word has done water
[1:12:26] took his picture it is with whom us
[1:12:30] everybody okay
[1:12:32] why does brother Branham appear there
[1:12:37] if it's not his picture
[1:12:39] why
[1:12:41] because message Believers are ashamed of
[1:12:45] this picture
[1:12:46] [Applause]
[1:12:50] and understand sometimes it's ignorance
[1:12:54] because you were taught wrong
[1:12:56] you didn't know what was the picture all
[1:12:59] about
[1:13:00] this picture is not about brother
[1:13:02] Branham it is a bad invisible God that
[1:13:07] is made visible
[1:13:08] [Applause]
[1:13:13] glory to God
[1:13:16] why do we have brother Brown I'm dead
[1:13:18] brother Branham he said Mr air Mr
[1:13:22] kipperman the night that the camera
[1:13:25] proved that he was not telling anything
[1:13:27] that was wrong it was water the truth
[1:13:29] and when the mechanical eye of the
[1:13:32] camera cut the vision not the vision the
[1:13:34] water reality
[1:13:36] the water Christ that we preach and so
[1:13:40] love was with us he promised to be with
[1:13:44] us and the camera did what took his
[1:13:47] picture a picture of who Christ do you
[1:13:49] see brother but I'm saying it's his
[1:13:51] picture no
[1:13:55] many times I have stayed in the past
[1:13:58] that has seen that light all the time
[1:14:00] but sometimes people will be a little
[1:14:04] water skeptic which you could believe
[1:14:07] they could be that way but that night
[1:14:16] since then
[1:14:20] it's been taken how many times several
[1:14:23] times in Germany just recently coming
[1:14:25] down when the anointing was and when he
[1:14:28] went back again
[1:14:30] and those things
[1:14:33] those pictures
[1:14:34] are not water magnifiers some water
[1:14:38] human being
[1:14:41] so if somebody pick up this picture here
[1:14:45] and begin to defy brother Branham that
[1:14:49] is his problem
[1:14:51] [Applause]
[1:14:53] the picture was not to magnify a man
[1:14:58] is a wrong approach it doesn't make the
[1:15:02] picture wrong
[1:15:05] or face must come but wow to him the
[1:15:10] offense come from
[1:15:11] [Applause]
[1:15:16] glory to God
[1:15:18] glory to God
[1:15:20] brother Branham if it's not to magnify
[1:15:23] some human being what is the purpose of
[1:15:26] this picture
[1:15:27] but it is water indicate the presence of
[1:15:31] who Jesus Christ among his water people
[1:15:34] so when they ask you why do you put this
[1:15:37] picture it is a vindication
[1:15:40] at the Jehovah of the Old Testament
[1:15:44] that God that led Moses the one that was
[1:15:48] with Saint Paul he is with us here and
[1:15:52] he is here this morning
[1:15:54] [Applause]
[1:15:59] why do we have that picture up there
[1:16:02] why a minister is shame of it
[1:16:07] let me ask you a question
[1:16:09] that picture now belongs to her
[1:16:13] and when you take that picture from the
[1:16:16] church
[1:16:17] you taking the picture of who God
[1:16:21] when you are rejecting the picture you
[1:16:24] are rejecting who God
[1:16:30] [Applause]
[1:16:35] what I'm giving you is John

[1:16:40] begin to play with this picture

[1:16:47] [Applause]
[1:16:49] everybody here everybody here everybody
[1:16:52] here
[1:16:54] if you look at chapter 19 Paul met this
[1:16:59] light
[1:17:01] he met the pillar of fire and the pillar
[1:17:04] of fire talked to him and after that
[1:17:06] experience God called a man by the name
[1:17:09] of ananias he said ananias go to Paul
[1:17:12] listen to me carefully he said then
[1:17:15] ananias answered Lord I have heard by
[1:17:18] many of this man
[1:17:21] how much evil he had water done to that
[1:17:24] Center Jerusalem and here he has
[1:17:26] Authority from the chief priest to bond
[1:17:29] all that coal underwater name God
[1:17:32] corrected
[1:17:35] amanias
[1:17:37] and he gave ananias the reason why him
[1:17:41] and Paul must meet together
[1:17:44] you know
[1:17:47] not only God and Paul meeting but God in
[1:17:52] the form of the pillar of fire meeting
[1:17:55] simple
[1:17:57] what was the purpose
[1:18:00] he said but the Lord said unto him God
[1:18:03] our way for he is the water chosen
[1:18:06] vessel so the pillar of fire came to
[1:18:10] identify the chosen vessel
[1:18:12] [Music]

[1:26:09] they don't even use their thinking
[1:26:11] anymore
[1:26:11] [Music]
[1:26:14] because they already were looking for a
[1:26:16] way out of the message
[1:26:19] everybody okay he said to you who are
[1:26:22] water trouble do what rest with us
[1:26:26] Lord Jesus shall be water revealed from
[1:26:29] water Heaven stop he didn't say the Lord
[1:26:32] Jesus will be coming from heaven
[1:26:36] everybody okay this is not the coming of
[1:26:40] the Lord
[1:26:43] are you with me yes this is the
[1:26:45] revealing
[1:26:48] they're revealing of God
[1:26:52] in what in heaven
[1:26:57] but who's gonna reveal him from heaven
[1:27:00] everybody okay
[1:27:02] he said when the Lord who Jesus so if
[1:27:07] that revealing is done in heaven when
[1:27:11] you look at that you must see Jesus
[1:27:13] [Applause]
[1:27:15] do you follow me if you don't see Jesus
[1:27:18] there it is not his revealing
[1:27:22] are you following me
[1:27:23] so they're he feeling is the revealing
[1:27:26] of Jesus
[1:27:29] where in heaven but who's going to make
[1:27:33] that picture
[1:27:34] who will give us that picture
[1:27:39] this message
[1:27:41] brother Branham say uh the Bible said
[1:27:43] when the Lord Jesus shall be watered
[1:27:46] from water heaven with his water so the
[1:27:51] mighty angels of God will reveal Jesus
[1:27:55] Christ in the heaven
[1:28:01] the revealing in Heaven by Angel
[1:28:05] s are singular or plural plural so we
[1:28:09] must have more than one angel
[1:28:11] everybody okay
[1:28:13] in water flaming fire
[1:28:16] so it gotta be a light
[1:28:20] everybody here so they're revealing in
[1:28:23] heaven must be done by a light
[1:28:28] I have a quote I didn't put it up see me
[1:28:30] after church
[1:28:31] he said in flaming fire taking water
[1:28:35] Vengeance if he's a lamb he is merciful
[1:28:39] if he's a lion he's coming as a church
[1:28:45] so that revealing must bring the judge
[1:28:48] outside
[1:28:50] [Applause]
[1:28:56] this message in the Bible
[1:29:00] I'm giving you this so you have your
[1:29:03] foundation in the Bible
[1:29:09] everybody okay he's coming as a judge to
[1:29:13] bring venges he's a lion
[1:29:16] that's why in Revelation 10 he can roll
[1:29:19] like a what
[1:29:20] and he said take advantage on them that
[1:29:23] know not God and that obeyed not to his
[1:29:26] water Gospel of gospel of who Lord Jesus
[1:29:29] so according to Second Thessalonians
[1:29:32] Paul prophesy
[1:29:37] everybody okay Paul prophesied about the
[1:29:41] coming of Jesus Christ
[1:29:42] but here Paul is prophesying not of the
[1:29:47] coming
[1:29:48] but after revealing of Jesus Christ by
[1:29:54] Mighty angel in heaven and he's going to
[1:29:58] bring him as a church
[1:30:03] what are you trying to say who will your
[1:30:06] mind brother

[1:30:11] I could see those Water Angels
[1:30:14] you know when we if I write a book even
[1:30:18] this Bible you can play around with it
[1:30:23] you can change it
[1:30:25] yeah amen but when something is on video
[1:30:28] or on tape you cannot end insert
[1:30:32] something on tip and manipulate it it is
[1:30:35] an absolute reverse reference
[1:30:38] brother Branham said those shaped back
[1:30:41] Wings traveling faster than than sand
[1:30:44] could travel they come from where
[1:30:47] eternity in a split like a water
[1:30:49] twinkling of an eye I won't touch those
[1:30:52] 62 because he could tell you something
[1:30:57] in the three kingdom of an eye so it's a
[1:31:00] speed that is connected to the rapture
[1:31:08] [Applause]
[1:31:09] everybody okay so whatever come here

[1:33:17] in Revelation 1 verse 20
[1:33:21] the Bible said the mystery of the Water
[1:33:23] Seven Stars which that soweth in my
[1:33:26] water right hand and the Seven water
[1:33:28] golden candle the Seven Stars are white
[1:33:31] angels
[1:33:34] our water seven are the Angels of the
[1:33:38] water seven churches so the Seven Star
[1:33:41] means how many angels seven angels and
[1:33:44] how many Angel brother Brian I'm saying
[1:33:45] seven
[1:33:49] I'm out of it
[1:33:50] let me continue Revelation 3 verse 1 the
[1:33:54] Bible said and unto the angel of the
[1:33:56] church in Sardis right these things say
[1:33:59] he that has how many seven spirits of
[1:34:02] God and the Water Seven Stars now John
[1:34:05] take the seventh Spirit and the seventh
[1:34:08] star and connect both of them together
[1:34:13] we have Seven and Seven Stars
[1:34:16] which are seven angels
[1:34:20] which John connected to water
[1:34:22] what does it mean seven spirit
[1:34:27] Oh Glory to God brother Branham said
[1:34:30] seven spirit
[1:34:31] the servant Spirit and the Water Seven
[1:34:35] Stars that Spirit towards the water
[1:34:38] angels that went to the Water Stars
[1:34:41] which were water Messengers
[1:34:46] so when power was working
[1:34:50] that's why Paul said the angel of the
[1:34:53] Lord who must serve talk to me
[1:34:57] it was one of them who have to work with
[1:35:00] her all along
[1:35:03] but because we are in the last stage
[1:35:06] in the seven churches you don't only get
[1:35:10] one
[1:35:12] [Music]
[1:35:12] [Applause]
[1:35:16] Generico they turn around the city
[1:35:19] faster
[1:35:21] second time third time fourth but on the
[1:35:25] seventh day they have to turn the city
[1:35:27] how many times seven times
[1:35:30] thank you
[1:35:32] I hope you're paying attention
[1:35:35] because I don't want to come back to
[1:35:36] this again
[1:35:42] Amen brother Branham says that seven
[1:35:46] times seven different times the water
[1:35:50] will anoint the water a messenger which
[1:35:53] was a star in his water today a spirit
[1:35:56] is water Eternal and the star that was
[1:35:58] made for a purpose to reflect the light
[1:36:01] in the water the dark of this church
[1:36:03] ages where candles and star out and star
[1:36:07] are representing the angel
[1:36:10] that Spirit was the one that went to the
[1:36:14] star and reflect the light of the water
[1:36:17] Holy Spirit through the star through
[1:36:20] that Water Church in that the word God
[1:36:23] told me have seven spirit
[1:36:30] everybody okay
[1:36:32] when you say God
[1:36:34] is a set
[1:36:37] of seven spirit
[1:36:40] everybody here everybody okay so through
[1:36:43] every Church ages God use one of the
[1:36:47] spirit as an angel
[1:36:50] and the angel Heavenly will leave heaven
[1:36:54] do you follow me and come to the angel
[1:36:57] on Earth
[1:36:59] and give him the message of that day
[1:37:04] everybody okay
[1:37:06] when he finished God sent the second one
[1:37:09] and the third one and the fourth one
[1:37:11] until the what seven one
[1:37:16] glory to God he says that he says the
[1:37:20] star reflected that age that wonder who
[1:37:23] the seventh Spirit are it is the seven
[1:37:26] messenger of the seven Water Church and
[1:37:29] each time that the star come in on the
[1:37:32] same the Holy Spirit come down and
[1:37:35] anoint that star and keep it just
[1:37:38] exactly like water
[1:37:41] in the Book of Revelation chapter 4 the
[1:37:45] Bible said out of the throne proceeding
[1:37:47] lightning and thundering and voices
[1:37:49] there were seven lamps of fire doing
[1:37:52] water burning before who the throne
[1:37:55] which are the water seven spirits of God
[1:38:00] so if you have a problem for me saying
[1:38:03] God have seven Spirit you got the
[1:38:04] scripture
[1:38:06] Revelation 5 Verse 6 I beheld in law in
[1:38:10] the midst of the throne and the four
[1:38:11] beasts and in the Beast of the Elder
[1:38:13] stood the water lamb as he has been
[1:38:16] watered it's a bleeding lamb
[1:38:19] you following me comma heavy water seven
[1:38:23] horns and what seven eyes which are the
[1:38:26] water seven spirits so the lamb himself
[1:38:30] is not one spirit for you to have the
[1:38:34] complete lamb you must have the seventh
[1:38:37] Spirit which are the seven angels so
[1:38:41] when the seven Angel comes
[1:38:44] [Music]
[1:38:46] to reveal Jesus Christ in the heaven
[1:38:50] huh everybody okay Paul said the
[1:38:54] revealing of Jesus Christ in the heaven

[1:39:09] Moon is the church the Sun is
[1:39:12] Christ and the light of the Sun
[1:39:16] shall be housed Sevenfold

[1:39:26] will have seven
[1:39:28] times

[2:00:17] we already went through this
[2:00:20] we already going through this we already
[2:00:22] went through this we already went
[2:00:25] through this we are here brother Branham
[2:00:27] said he is those seals for the whole
[2:00:31] word of God is what Christ and Christ is
[2:00:34] what there was water open so when you
[2:00:37] talking bad about the 70. you talking
[2:00:40] bad about who Jesus Christ do you see
[2:00:43] what Minister are doing
[2:00:45] when you say we don't need those seven
[2:00:48] seal
[2:00:51] what are you talking about
[2:00:54] he said what is the opening of the seal
[2:00:57] that revealing who Christ remember Jesus
[2:01:01] Christ we will be revealed in the heaven
[2:01:04] by Mary angels
[2:01:09] [Applause]
[2:01:10] brother Branham say brother Branham say
[2:01:13] the wise shall know but the water
[2:01:16] foolish foolish the water and why the
[2:01:19] unwise version would what wouldn't know
[2:01:22] they shall know their God now now how he
[2:01:25] shall appear not coming not coming not
[2:01:29] coming how he shall water appear in the
[2:01:32] water is to bring the people backwards
[2:01:35] so that the bride will know her what her
[2:01:38] husband know her water May well mate is
[2:01:41] the water revealed word
[2:01:44] what's up
[2:01:47] did I lost anyone
[2:01:51] brother Stephen if you done that picture
[2:01:55] like this and look you can probably set
[2:01:59] from the audience it is Hope Christ why
[2:02:03] because the Revelation in the Heaven
[2:02:06] Must show us crossed
[2:02:10] when the angel come and they do the
[2:02:13] picture they do the thing online or or
[2:02:17] on the sky when you look at that thing
[2:02:19] you must see Christ
[2:02:21] because Jesus Christ must be revealed in
[2:02:24] the heaven by Mary Angel so when Mighty
[2:02:27] Angel grouped together you must see who
[2:02:33] brother Branham said see his eyes
[2:02:36] looking here just as perfectly as he
[2:02:39] could be wearing the water wide way
[2:02:42] because he's coming for judgment for
[2:02:45] water Supreme deity a judge
[2:02:48] Heaven and Earth you can see his what
[2:02:51] eyes his water no he's what mouth he is
[2:02:54] the Supreme water judge there is none by
[2:02:57] water him that is a perfect
[2:03:01] can you read it again that is a perfect
[2:03:03] what identification again and the water
[2:03:07] Vindication that this message is what
[2:03:10] the truth this is the water truth it is
[2:03:13] what so this picture
[2:03:17] is a Vindication that the message your
[2:03:21] brother Branham is true amen
[2:03:24] [Applause]
[2:03:28] what
[2:03:30] go ask the people that are leaving the
[2:03:33] message what trouble them
[2:03:36] it's always this picture
[2:03:41] amen amen
[2:03:43] it is a new revelation
[2:03:46] it is on tape in 1963. they took a uh in
[2:03:51] 1962 and then on 63 they took the
[2:03:54] picture and the people still have a
[2:03:56] problem with that
[2:03:58] why do we put that picture there because
[2:04:01] it's a Vindication that this message is
[2:04:04] true
[2:04:07] and if you done that who do you see all
[2:04:10] right when you look over there who do
[2:04:12] you see Christ
[2:04:14] amen that's right you okay
[2:04:18] you okay
[2:04:21] why do we put this picture here why do
[2:04:23] we put that picture there
[2:04:26] but we have another one here
[2:04:32] [Music]
[2:04:33] I would change maybe the title everybody
[2:04:36] okay
[2:04:37] why do we have this then
[2:04:39] this picture
[2:04:43] is in 1962
[2:04:46] this picture was well well before that
[2:04:51] it is a picture that was done by an
[2:04:54] artist
[2:04:56] called Huffman
[2:05:01] this picture here vanity catch this
[2:05:05] picture
[2:05:06] but before I got there brother Branham
[2:05:09] say it is just like this comparing the
[2:05:12] waters Seven Seals when God used Martin
[2:05:15] Luther for the coming out of the first
[2:05:17] church or that church and when he used
[2:05:20] John Wesley and he gradually brought
[2:05:22] them out and was revealing in them that
[2:05:25] churches everybody okay but in this
[2:05:28] water
[2:05:29] the reason that that was such a
[2:05:33] tremendous thing
[2:05:34] everybody okay that he spoke it of it he
[2:05:38] spoke of it here
[2:05:40] and showed us what seven Thunders
[2:05:47] and in which magazine look and what life
[2:05:51] water magazine
[2:05:56] so this picture brother Branham called
[2:05:59] that the seven pandas
[2:06:02] he said they took the picture of the
[2:06:05] seven Thunders
[2:06:06] [Music]
[2:06:08] because the seven Thunder where the
[2:06:11] Revelation contained in the water
[2:06:13] so when you are joking with the seven
[2:06:16] Thunders
[2:06:18] when you are joking with the seals
[2:06:20] we don't need those standards we don't
[2:06:22] need those seals you are rejecting the
[2:06:25] very message that you think you are
[2:06:28] preaching
[2:06:31] everybody okay everybody okay because
[2:06:34] this picture here is a Vindication of
[2:06:38] this picture
[2:06:43] this picture was way before brother
[2:06:47] maybe before brother Prana was born that
[2:06:50] picture existed
[2:06:52] amen so why did we have this picture in
[2:06:55] the message churches
[2:06:58] [Music]
[2:07:00] picture was made by men
[2:07:03] it can be good or it can be wrong
[2:07:08] picture was not drawn by a man
[2:07:12] this were brought on by angels how can
[2:07:15] they nature picture where you dear
[2:07:18] matches this picture here
[2:07:22] try with your rocket
[2:07:28] [Music]
[2:07:29] brother Branham there is not an artist
[2:07:32] in the world that could take that in the
[2:07:36] world could paint his picture
[2:07:37] the character of his water face the best
[2:07:41] which year is this 55. this is on tip
[2:07:45] nobody can play with the tapes he said
[2:07:48] the best I have seen is the water
[2:07:52] 1955 brother Branham saw Jesus Christ in
[2:07:55] a vision
[2:07:57] when brother brought them look at Jesus
[2:08:00] in the vision
[2:08:01] brother Branham came out from division
[2:08:03] he began to look how to describe Jesus
[2:08:06] Christ
[2:08:07] they brought him pictures of Jesus
[2:08:10] Christ that were thrown from this man
[2:08:12] from this man from this man from this
[2:08:15] man when brother Branham look at the
[2:08:17] picture
[2:08:18] he said the one that look like the Jesus
[2:08:22] I saw in the vision is this one in 1955
[2:08:32] brother Branham I got it on all what and
[2:08:37] everything I do what when brother
[2:08:39] Branham saw this picture he took this
[2:08:41] picture he began to print it and put it
[2:08:44] in his Bible in a home and everything
[2:08:46] what about why do you need this picture
[2:08:48] he's often a Christian that's not my
[2:08:51] problem I'm looking at what is going on
[2:08:53] because God can give a vision to pharaoh
[2:08:57] God can give a vision to Nebuchadnezzar
[2:09:03] can give a vision to Balaam
[2:09:06] that's not my problem
[2:09:08] father Branham kept this picture
[2:09:11] why brother Branham say that is because
[2:09:14] that looks just like water
[2:09:17] so I'll pray the water as close as is
[2:09:21] good water
[2:09:24] in 19 water 55 now when the seals were
[2:09:29] open they took this picture that you saw
[2:09:31] them
[2:09:33] Amen brother Branham now comes back in
[2:09:36] 63. you can make the math he said I
[2:09:40] never did care for water salesman's
[2:09:42] picture sauce man had a picture of Jesus
[2:09:44] Christ brother random look he said not
[2:09:46] this one
[2:09:49] which one this one why do you love this
[2:09:52] one because that's the Jesus I saw
[2:09:55] do you have a proof we don't have a
[2:09:57] proof brother Branham never took a
[2:09:59] picture in the vision you have the
[2:10:01] vision for himself now God moved the
[2:10:04] vision from the prophet so that the
[2:10:06] entire world
[2:10:08] will understand that what brother
[2:10:10] Branham saw what he speak what he spoke
[2:10:14] is exactly the truth
[2:10:17] brother Branham say I like water
[2:10:20] Horseman's picture can you give him more
[2:10:23] volume
[2:10:24] he said I like Huffman picture they had
[2:10:28] the title 33. why 33
[2:10:35] why water
[2:10:40] at 33 you know and I have got a big
[2:10:44] water picture of it because when I seen
[2:10:47] him in the vision that time that is just
[2:10:51] the way he watered looked there he was a
[2:10:54] gathered fixed so he will be looking
[2:10:56] well right at me when I was water
[2:10:58] praying in water this picture brother
[2:11:01] took even he made sure when Jesus is
[2:11:03] looking he looked the way he prays
[2:11:05] all right
[2:11:07] why
[2:11:09] brother problem he said he is weak
[2:11:12] before he ever happened I say that this
[2:11:15] is in 65 and that day when that happened
[2:11:18] it went up and then you turned that
[2:11:21] picture sideways
[2:11:23] if you got to if you get Luke magazine
[2:11:26] or what Life Magazine you look and you
[2:11:29] leave start sideway there he is just
[2:11:33] what perfectly like water Houseman head
[2:11:36] of Christ looking water right there why
[2:11:38] he was standing there looking water
[2:11:41] right back roof exactly the Revelation
[2:11:44] was what correct this picture Vindicated
[2:11:48] the picture of husband
[2:11:50] how can you remove this picture how can
[2:11:53] you remove this picture and you are
[2:11:55] keeping this picture in the church
[2:11:58] who taught you about this picture
[2:12:01] where did you learn about this picture
[2:12:03] you learned it from Brother Prana how
[2:12:06] can you keep this one and you are
[2:12:08] removing that one
[2:12:10] [Applause]
[2:12:12] why do we put this picture
[2:12:15] why do we put this picture why do we put
[2:12:17] this picture
[2:12:23] everybody okay everybody okay
[2:12:26] let's Rush quickly I have 15 minutes and
[2:12:29] I stop
[2:12:30] stand with me in the scripture
[2:12:36] it's the groom's oil and the great
[2:12:38] mystery it is 43.
[2:12:42] you okay or you want to go home
[2:12:45] let me strike this and we go home
[2:12:47] everybody okay everybody okay
[2:12:50] everybody okay yes sir
[2:12:54] we are still on the trashing floor with
[2:12:56] roof and then from the threshing floor
[2:12:59] we are dealing with the second oil
[2:13:02] now in our reading
[2:13:05] when you look in the Book of Ruth we are
[2:13:07] with roof down into the holiest
[2:13:11] and Boaz when he met Ruth he said the
[2:13:14] Lord recompense that work
[2:13:17] and the full reward not a partial a
[2:13:20] complete seven
[2:13:23] are you following me a seven reward a
[2:13:26] complete reward a complete reward be
[2:13:30] given thee of the Lord God of Israel
[2:13:36] what are the wings of God
[2:13:41] [Music]
[2:13:43] I'm gonna strike one portion that is
[2:13:46] connected to what I spoke
[2:13:49] so we can stop right there everybody
[2:13:51] okay
[2:13:52] everybody okay
[2:13:54] he says in some verse uh chapter 61
[2:13:59] David say I will abide in that water for
[2:14:03] whatever what is the Tabernacle of God
[2:14:07] he said I will water trust remember have
[2:14:11] to do what trust in the water wings and
[2:14:15] David say that I will abide not get in
[2:14:18] and come out the Tabernacle but when I
[2:14:21] get in the Tabernacle I will stay there
[2:14:23] everybody okay and when I abide I will
[2:14:27] abide there forever why I will trust in
[2:14:31] the water cover of the water so the
[2:14:34] wings of God is the Tabernacle of God
[2:14:39] amen
[2:14:40] amen everybody okay so when Boaz was
[2:14:44] telling roof that you have come and you
[2:14:47] have trusted in the wings of God he was
[2:14:50] telling him that you are entering the
[2:14:52] Tabernacle that's why when we are going
[2:14:55] with roof we found out that the walk the
[2:14:59] step of roof are exactly the step of the
[2:15:02] Tabernacle everybody okay because roof
[2:15:05] entering the wings of Jehovah she was
[2:15:07] entering the Tabernacle but she got to
[2:15:10] go to roof deciding roof working roof
[2:15:13] all the way to roof resting Where We Are
[2:15:15] everybody okay now roof was working not
[2:15:19] alone
[2:15:20] roof was the last woman to be hired
[2:15:25] by boys
[2:15:28] are you following me if you tired I stop
[2:15:31] here and we can pick up when you're
[2:15:33] fresh
[2:15:35] already have some other women
[2:15:38] some other made it
[2:15:41] those Maiden were already working in the
[2:15:44] field
[2:15:46] glory to God where am I at
[2:15:49] Lord help me
[2:15:51] I'm trying to skip okay
[2:15:53] boys already have some mate
[2:15:56] some made it they were already working
[2:15:58] on the field
[2:15:59] they were already under salary
[2:16:02] the last one go as hired
[2:16:06] because roof was working under the
[2:16:09] Commandment of God that if you're a
[2:16:11] widow you can go through uh through the
[2:16:13] field and get whatever you want when
[2:16:15] boas met roof he said no no no no no I
[2:16:18] don't want you to go everywhere I want
[2:16:20] you to stay on this field but at that
[2:16:22] don't want you to be coming here on the
[2:16:25] widowhood
[2:16:26] and now
[2:16:28] everybody okay I don't want you to come
[2:16:31] here and still behave under the
[2:16:33] scripture of a widow amen I want you now
[2:16:36] to consider yourself as a maid
[2:16:39] you are now an employee
[2:16:42] everybody okay so the last woman
[2:16:48] that was hired
[2:16:51] amen the last woman that was hired among
[2:16:55] the maidens was roof
[2:16:57] so now the group of women of Boas have
[2:17:01] the maidens
[2:17:03] plus roof
[2:17:06] all of them were female
[2:17:11] or they were women
[2:17:14] everybody okay
[2:17:16] keep this pretty good
[2:17:18] so under the field of boas which was
[2:17:22] under the Reapers
[2:17:24] because we know the whippers are the
[2:17:25] Angels under the messenger
[2:17:29] amen the work that was done was the
[2:17:34] working of women
[2:17:39] in other words it was female spirit that
[2:17:43] were working
[2:17:47] everybody okay

[2:18:15] of the male
[2:18:17] of the man's spirit
[2:18:20] was working
[2:18:25] everybody okay so we are moving from the
[2:18:28] field of Boaz into the trashing floor
[2:18:31] but when they moved from the field into
[2:18:35] the trashing floor all the maidens were
[2:18:38] disqualified
[2:18:40] right
[2:18:43] are you okay
[2:18:45] they work for boas
[2:18:47] but none of them became the wife of Boaz
[2:18:51] the only one that moved with the further
[2:18:55] part
[2:18:57] with the new
[2:18:58] unfolding with the change of the
[2:19:02] ministry

[2:21:28] everybody okay
[2:21:30] the first journey started from the
[2:21:33] beginning
[2:21:36] all the way
[2:21:38] to a place where every virgin slumbered
[2:21:43] and slept
[2:21:45] everybody okay
[2:21:46] they all slumbered
[2:21:50] and they slept
[2:21:52] until the midnight
[2:21:57] everybody okay
[2:21:58] the second Journey started after
[2:22:02] midnight
[2:22:06] amen and that Journey went from Midnight
[2:22:11] to meeting the groomer
[2:22:16] everybody okay
[2:22:18] what are you trying to say by that
[2:22:21] the journey that began here began at
[2:22:25] night
[2:22:31] because the Bible says in Matthew 25
[2:22:34] verse 1 that then they shall the Kingdom
[2:22:37] of Heaven be thy come to how many
[2:22:39] virgins which took the water why do you
[2:22:42] need a lamp for in the day
[2:22:46] what do you need the lamp in a day so
[2:22:48] the journey started the water
[2:22:50] before the midnight up in Roman 13.
[2:23:00] I'm gonna hit the hyper life we stop you
[2:23:03] go chew on it
[2:23:06] if you're there you can say Amen
[2:23:09] pages are still turning
[2:23:18] everybody okay
[2:23:21] glory to God
[2:23:23] Romans 13 verse 11 if you dare you can
[2:23:26] say Amen
[2:23:28] but Angel is there yes sir okay praise
[2:23:31] God he said and that knowing the time
[2:23:36] that now it is high time to do work
[2:23:41] is he there
[2:23:43] okay it's a hard time to do what
[2:23:46] it's in Roman 13 verse 11 my brother
[2:23:50] it's a high term to a work
[2:23:53] when somebody needs to awake what are
[2:23:56] they doing
[2:23:58] okay it is hard time to awake out of
[2:24:02] water
[2:24:04] you must say brother Stephen they could
[2:24:05] have been sleeping in the day let's see
[2:24:08] what time they're sleeping
[2:24:09] for now is our Salvation near than we
[2:24:13] believe
[2:24:14] the water now is water for Spain when
[2:24:19] Paul started preaching it was already
[2:24:21] night
[2:24:24] am I reading a different Bible That's
[2:24:27] why throughout the seven Church ages God
[2:24:30] have to use the star
[2:24:34] the star means that their son is no
[2:24:37] longer there so you need to use the
[2:24:40] light of the sun oh the light of the
[2:24:43] star to illuminate the night
[2:24:48] why do you use Seven Stars
[2:24:51] it's telling you that the sun is no
[2:24:53] longer we are in night time that's why
[2:24:56] Paul in his time as the first messenger
[2:24:59] Paul said that the night is already fast
[2:25:02] when Paul started he was the night when
[2:25:05] the Virgin started they started the
[2:25:07] night
[2:25:08] everybody okay yes sir let's continue he
[2:25:11] said the night is first pet
[2:25:14] the day is a water Paul thought the
[2:25:17] Rapture is going to happen in his day
[2:25:19] everybody okay
[2:25:21] let us therefore do what
[2:25:24] cast off the work of darkness and let us
[2:25:27] put on the water the armor of water why
[2:25:31] the armor of light because it's dark
[2:25:35] everybody okay so the Virgin that
[2:25:39] started this journey started the journey
[2:25:41] before midnight
[2:25:43] everybody okay and the first journey
[2:25:46] went from there before midnight all the
[2:25:50] way to midnight but by midnight all the
[2:25:52] virgins were already slumbering
[2:25:55] and the journey the first portion of the
[2:25:58] journey you following me this Fortune
[2:26:01] was
[2:26:04] illuminated by the first oil
[2:26:08] I'm gonna go slowly give me a little bit
[2:26:11] of time if I can strike what I need to
[2:26:13] strike because it's connected to what
[2:26:15] you just spoke
[2:26:18] big night
[2:26:19] the first one was no longer working
[2:26:29] if you lost to raise your hand
[2:26:33] Knight day the second oil kicking
[2:26:37] everybody okay
[2:26:39] so on the first journey every virgin
[2:26:42] qualified
[2:26:46] yeah
[2:26:47] everybody okay
[2:26:50] get no oil wash the oil that determine
[2:26:53] who will be married and who's not gonna
[2:26:57] be married
[2:27:00] everybody okay because the second oil
[2:27:03] could determine who was wise and who was
[2:27:07] not twice
[2:27:10] in other words the second word is the
[2:27:14] all of marriage and divorce
[2:27:16] [Music]
[2:27:18] [Applause]
[2:27:20] Hallelujah
[2:27:23] [Music]
[2:27:25] let's go slowly my friend
[2:27:27] according to the Bible according to the
[2:27:31] Bible when a woman is engaged she is
[2:27:34] considered to be married
[2:27:36] that's why they told Joseph that refused
[2:27:40] not to take Mary the water because they
[2:27:43] were already married when you give the
[2:27:44] vow you are hooked you already married
[2:27:46] even though you are not intimate yet in
[2:27:50] the physical everybody okay so these
[2:27:53] women the 10th version all of them were
[2:27:56] married by being espoused to the groom
[2:28:00] [Music]
[2:28:01] everybody okay but the one that entered
[2:28:04] into the true marriage where only those
[2:28:08] that have the second one so the second
[2:28:10] one brought marriage
[2:28:15] and he also brought divorce
[2:28:21] where is marriage
[2:28:24] Matthew 25 verse 10 and while they want
[2:28:27] to buy the bridegroom did water
[2:28:31] my brother is up there the bridegroom
[2:28:33] came and days that were water ready went
[2:28:37] in with him into water marriage those
[2:28:39] that were already were those that had
[2:28:41] the second oil so the secondary bought
[2:28:44] water marriage but he also bring water
[2:28:47] divorce open Matthew 25
[2:29:01] if you did you can say Amen
[2:29:04] Matthew 25 verse 11.

[2:29:26] and while they went to buy the
[2:29:28] bridegroom came and they that were ready

[2:30:12] that the foolish virgin took
[2:30:16] their attitude

[2:36:48] what yeah back water back there the life
[2:36:51] is water moving on Peter can you feed
[2:36:53] the water bride of Jesus Christ
[2:36:57] foreign
[2:37:02] [Applause]
[2:37:06] you know I was telling somebody
[2:37:09] that people in this message a really
[2:37:12] miss brother brother
[2:37:15] when brother Branham was talking about
[2:37:17] Luther
[2:37:18] and Presbyterian and Wesley brother
[2:37:21] Branham was picking a sample
[2:37:24] to demonstrate or to manifest the
[2:37:28] denominational spirit
[2:37:31] if I tell you
[2:37:33] you know a man you know a man you know
[2:37:36] men are big men are bulky men are these
[2:37:39] you still have an illusion but if I turn
[2:37:42] around I say a man who look like brother
[2:37:43] Charles then you have an idea I say man
[2:37:46] look like brother Angelo now your idea
[2:37:48] becomes more clear so if brother Branham
[2:37:51] just say denomination denomination you
[2:37:53] won't get it brother Branham have to go
[2:37:55] where that Spirit was operated to show
[2:37:58] you that look at what they're doing
[2:37:59] they're doing clicks that is
[2:38:02] denomination they are breaking our
[2:38:04] Brotherhood that is denomination they
[2:38:07] are separating the Christian that is
[2:38:09] denomination they pass through our
[2:38:10] detail that is denomination and then
[2:38:13] brother Branham have to demonstrate all
[2:38:15] of him
[2:38:16] amen so the message believer when they
[2:38:19] came they kept their eyes on the Baptist
[2:38:22] on the Pentecostal and on the metal this
[2:38:25] and they missed
[2:38:28] brother Branham used them to demonstrate
[2:38:32] the denomination of spirit
[2:38:35] the denomination of spirit was already
[2:38:38] working with them so leave them alone
[2:38:42] come into the message now
[2:38:45] [Applause]
[2:38:48] do you follow me
[2:38:49] that denomination of spirit when the
[2:38:53] life left the shark he also entered the
[2:38:56] message ring
[2:38:59] everybody okay now you need to leave the
[2:39:02] Baptist alone leave the metal this alone
[2:39:05] leave the Pentecostal alone leave the
[2:39:09] Presbyterian Alone brother brother I'm
[2:39:11] already dealt with them let's see the
[2:39:14] Baptist in the message
[2:39:26] that's where your problem is
[2:39:28] that's
[2:39:30] why you go to a Baptist Church you live
[2:39:34] you go to a message you feel the same
[2:39:37] spirit
[2:39:38] it is not a message Church it is a
[2:39:42] Baptist Church under the pretest of the
[2:39:44] message
[2:39:48] [Music]

[2:48:33] calling
[2:48:33] bringing back to God through a water
[2:48:36] channel that he water promise to bring
[2:48:39] it water bad so God in every age have a
[2:48:43] specific Channel
[2:48:49] in the day of Pentecost they have to
[2:48:52] wait for the Holy Ghost
[2:48:54] brother Branham say after Pentecost we
[2:48:57] don't wait for the Holy Ghost so if I

[2:49:35] there is water that is our way or water
[2:49:39] his ways God has a way for water today
[2:49:44] for he is always made a way for
[2:49:46] everything God at the beginning nor the
[2:49:49] hand so he has laid out his water
[2:49:52] scripture for water each age and that
[2:49:55] age when he comes now don't fail to see
[2:49:59] this damage when he come along usually
[2:50:02] the Water mystery is so water mixer into
[2:50:06] water isms and water so forth till they
[2:50:09] are water Mills and miles away from the
[2:50:11] word that's why it's hard to move
[2:50:14] message Believer from a Pentecostal
[2:50:17] tradition
[2:50:19] amen
[2:50:23] everybody okay he said God has made a
[2:50:27] way for us God love his children he
[2:50:29] loves his people he wants to help them
[2:50:31] he wants to help you more than you want
[2:50:33] to help
[2:50:35] if you can get that in your heart that
[2:50:37] God is more willing to help you than you
[2:50:40] are to help yourself but he has the
[2:50:42] water wait and that is the only way that
[2:50:46] he will work is through his way you must
[2:50:50] come to water his terms
[2:50:54] what are you trying to say when God
[2:50:57] opened the message of Luther
[2:50:59] do you follow me you can never find God
[2:51:03] but we're looteries
[2:51:06] do you get what I'm saying yes sir you
[2:51:09] get what I'm saying if you found God in
[2:51:12] that age that God will bring you back
[2:51:14] where looteries
[2:51:17] and when God moved to Wesley age
[2:51:21] if you want to thank God you must find
[2:51:24] him where we're slaves
[2:51:27] when God moved into the Pentecostal age
[2:51:30] you must find God in the channel he's
[2:51:33] operating
[2:51:36] if not you're gonna miss God
[2:51:43] help me he said you must come to his
[2:51:46] term not your turn
[2:51:48] his turn you wanted a water certain way
[2:51:53] but he gives you water his way
[2:51:59] God said this is my messenger you are
[2:52:02] taking the messenger you rejected and
[2:52:04] you're going with your own thinking yeah
[2:52:06] you want to get your own Holy Ghost
[2:52:09] right now
[2:52:12] amen
[2:52:14] Lord help me finish here
[2:52:17] how am I he said but each age has its
[2:52:21] part of the water gospel already what
[2:52:23] predicted this bubble is the complete
[2:52:26] revelation of Jesus Christ they can no
[2:52:29] more add to it or anything taken away
[2:52:32] from it the person who does it is Curse
[2:52:34] we cannot add nothing to it take nothing
[2:52:37] from it we must look in here and see
[2:52:40] what is Promised for water this age and
[2:52:42] see what you and then see it what
[2:52:44] happened that is water God interpreting
[2:52:47] his own water world that's why when
[2:52:50] brother Branham says this
[2:52:53] let's just ring the bell now we found
[2:52:56] that in each age When God Says certain
[2:52:59] things will happen here come thy man
[2:53:01] along and manifest that here come thy
[2:53:04] people along and live that that was God
[2:53:06] himself living in the people because he
[2:53:08] was answering of he was answering of his
[2:53:11] word now God's only provided way and
[2:53:16] only provided what plan today is water
[2:53:19] his son through his word for what this
[2:53:22] age
[2:53:23] amen that's the only provided way that's
[2:53:26] why we cannot take you back to Luther we
[2:53:29] cannot take you back to Wesley we cannot
[2:53:31] take you back to colomba that is not
[2:53:33] God's program for today

[2:55:46] spirit of God in this water last day
[2:55:49] that we are not living in a fully

[2:56:13] faith
[2:56:17] what gives you rapturing faith it is not
[2:56:20] the seven Thunder is it not the third
[2:56:23] pool so why are you playing with the
[2:56:25] Thunders why are you playing with the
[2:56:27] seals why are you playing with the pools
[2:56:30] give me the entire message
[2:56:33] don't tell me what is inspired on what
[2:56:36] is notified don't tell me what is not
[2:56:38] necessary and what is necessary I need
[2:56:41] the whole thing I need the entire
[2:56:43] message the whole things belong to me
[2:56:46] let's stand
[2:56:47] [Applause]
[2:57:06] eat it
[2:57:09] which token do you need
[2:57:14] you want to go get the TD Jake
[2:57:17] you want to go get it a Joel Austin you
[2:57:19] want to go get it at the Methodist
[2:57:22] you need to find where the life is
[2:57:28] people brought their own Baptist idea
[2:57:31] into the message they brought their own
[2:57:34] Pentecostal idea into the message the
[2:57:37] one who came from Presbyterian Church
[2:57:38] bring Presbyterian tradition in the
[2:57:41] message and if you go to that message
[2:57:43] they behave like press we tell you you
[2:57:45] go to the message they behave like
[2:57:46] Pentecostal because the pastor came from
[2:57:49] a Pentecostal chain you will see them
[2:57:51] all the way just move it Just watch
[2:57:53] where the person came from
[2:57:55] but we take everything
[2:58:07] we're looking for another search of the
[2:58:09] Holy Spirit into the church for water
[2:58:12] just before we come and everything is
[2:58:15] sitting straight in order for that and I
[2:58:17] believe that we are now at the time that
[2:58:21] the word should have water preeminine I
[2:58:23] believe that the time to lay aside our
[2:58:26] what Creed and our water and come back
[2:58:29] to water the word which word are you
[2:58:31] coming back to Jesus Christ
[2:58:33] and Jesus Christ is water
[2:58:39] the seals that were open because the
[2:58:42] seals were
[2:58:43] Christ
[2:58:45] that seal is not the book
[2:58:48] it is not intellectual it is a person
[2:58:56] amen now it's beginning to pull away
[2:58:59] their weights begin to be seen this is
[2:59:02] not a Pentecostal age this is the latter
[2:59:06] day this is the
[2:59:08] this is the this is when water
[2:59:11] must be water to follow God this is Luke
[2:59:17] to be water this is the second hey I
[2:59:22] won't say it you fill it up yourself you
[2:59:25] fill it up yourself you fill it up
[2:59:28] yourself
[2:59:29] this is the second one
[2:59:31] [Applause]
[2:59:37] this is water
[2:59:39] I have heard the Lord and I was coming
[2:59:42] but now I can see with my water
[2:59:51] use it
[2:59:52] for a reference
[2:59:55] sometimes Minister here for mother
[2:59:58] Minister and they just repeat what they
[3:00:00] heard not knowing they are blaspheming
[3:00:02] the message
[3:00:04] because a big preacher says that the
[3:00:08] seals are not revealed you will see
[3:00:10] Minister under him all of them will
[3:00:12] preach the seals are not revealed not
[3:00:14] even taking time like Paul to sit down
[3:00:16] and to pray God and to read the message
[3:00:19] and to look at the Bible and to study
[3:00:22] for themselves and ask Elders like
[3:00:25] Elders I don't understand this I don't
[3:00:27] understand to see what is going on but
[3:00:30] we just copy copy one another copy copy
[3:00:33] one another and before you know it we
[3:00:35] got clicks
[3:00:38] this convention clicks these convention
[3:00:40] clicks this convention the people over
[3:00:42] there don't go in this way the people is
[3:00:44] that the Holy Ghost
[3:00:46] is that the Holy Ghost and we claim to
[3:00:49] believe the same message
[3:00:52] no we're not in the same message we got
[3:00:56] the message and denomination under the
[3:00:58] message
[3:00:59] but it's time to come out of those
[3:01:01] denominations
[3:01:03] let's go back to the work
[3:01:06] where we can fellowship with our brother
[3:01:08] fellowship with her sister even if they
[3:01:10] don't understand we understand them we
[3:01:13] bear with them show a good attitude let
[3:01:16] me show you maybe something you don't
[3:01:17] know
[3:01:18] Apollos was a preacher but he didn't
[3:01:22] know everything he took power as krita
[3:01:25] and Priscilla a brother and a sister to
[3:01:27] show a preacher
[3:01:29] [Applause]
[3:01:37] [Music]
[3:01:39] Lord willing we will continue next time
[3:01:41] brother David let me talk to the boss
[3:01:44] and see I might change this subject
[3:01:47] the title and this third out for today
[3:01:51] need to go for next week let's pray
[3:01:53] Heavenly Father
[3:01:55] Lord we are approaching you again humbly
[3:01:57] this morning Father thanking you for
[3:01:59] your grace
[3:02:00] for your love for your mercy and for
[3:02:03] everything you have been doing for us
[3:02:05] father I thank you for the grace that
[3:02:08] the people have given us to go some
[3:02:11] extra mile so that we can lay the
[3:02:13] foundation not only for the people here
[3:02:16] in spoken word Tabernacle but they are
[3:02:19] people worldwide that are confused that
[3:02:22] have questioned they are Minister that
[3:02:25] have copied one another and never had a
[3:02:28] chance to sit down and some of them
[3:02:30] don't mean bad but probably they don't
[3:02:32] have access to the whole material to
[3:02:36] know certain quotes that they were not
[3:02:37] exposed to or sometimes just as you use
[3:02:41] the far form Ministry we need one
[3:02:43] another to Fellowship to talk so that we
[3:02:46] can share different views that the other
[3:02:49] doesn't want to see does not have seen
[3:02:52] yet except if the attitude is bad then
[3:02:55] we have to rely in prayer so that you
[3:02:57] can sweeten the temper and then father
[3:03:00] we can open our heart to see what is
[3:03:02] going on Father this is to stabilize the
[3:03:05] church this is to unders to make your
[3:03:08] children understand Father Paul was
[3:03:11] fighting against you not even realizing
[3:03:14] that he was persecuting you because he
[3:03:17] was under the leadership of men under
[3:03:20] the leadership of the Sanhedrin under
[3:03:23] the leadership of the high priest and he
[3:03:25] thought what they were talking in the
[3:03:27] hasah engine that was the absolute but
[3:03:30] father Your Grace reveal itself unto him
[3:03:34] Lord showing him that power you are
[3:03:37] persecuting me and he realized that the
[3:03:40] very thing that he was attacking was the
[3:03:43] very life that could have changed and
[3:03:45] save him and father if you did it for
[3:03:48] Paul the time is later the people in the
[3:03:51] message has suffered under many Doctrine
[3:03:54] and the many move and the many pools
[3:03:57] here and there until the younger
[3:04:00] generation That Grew didn't even have
[3:04:02] any ground on the scripture they just he
[3:04:05] quote quote quote but don't know how to
[3:04:07] trace things in the scripture but father
[3:04:10] you left us some Elders that could
[3:04:12] direct us Lord father you are bringing
[3:04:14] up a new crop that is Lord father
[3:04:17] bringing things clearly so that your
[3:04:19] children can see Delight because you are
[3:04:22] not the author of confusion Lord may you
[3:04:25] Enlighten your children may you bring
[3:04:27] them Revelation May those that have been
[3:04:30] struggling may they see the light may
[3:04:33] they understand where we need to take
[3:04:35] the people to because if we take them
[3:04:37] back to the nomination father we will
[3:04:39] fail
[3:04:41] the church fair the individual power
[3:04:43] went into the raft went into the rest
[3:04:46] and the wedding for the Rapture but they
[3:04:49] without us
[3:04:50] they cannot be made perfect and Paul
[3:04:53] could even say that when that which is
[3:04:55] perfect to his God he knew he didn't
[3:04:58] have the complete revelation
[3:04:59] father now it has been now open and that
[3:05:03] Revelation in the brother will Quicken
[3:05:05] and bring the dead to rise again it
[3:05:08] takes more than what we have in the ages
[3:05:10] that's why you came yourself and opened
[3:05:13] the seals now that no one could open it
[3:05:17] was not brother Branham that opened them
[3:05:19] because when they look for the King's
[3:05:21] Men with him and brother Branham was
[3:05:23] nothing even John himself was weeping he
[3:05:26] only took the lamb himself to come and
[3:05:29] take the book and break it and when you
[3:05:31] came down you put one foot on the earth
[3:05:33] one foot on there on the on the sea you
[3:05:36] are mastering the two beasts with an
[3:05:38] open book where the seals are broken
[3:05:41] make those that don't understand these
[3:05:43] seals may you help them Lord may you
[3:05:46] take this congregation may they go home
[3:05:49] each one of them may they come back and
[3:05:52] they appointed all the time at home and
[3:05:55] review this sermon and open the
[3:05:57] scripture and search the scripture and
[3:05:59] go quote by code and communicate with me
[3:06:02] if they need more
[3:06:04] because I have more court that I could
[3:06:06] have provided than this
[3:06:08] but father may you help them we thank
[3:06:10] you for everything we prayed for those
[3:06:12] that are sick father there has been a
[3:06:15] virus on demand making children and
[3:06:17] people sick and if anybody has been
[3:06:19] affected father may you touch them may
[3:06:22] you remember brother John as they are
[3:06:24] Lord father in The Wedding of her sister
[3:06:26] living father may you help them so that
[3:06:29] everything goes well and may they come
[3:06:31] here safely father protect us throughout
[3:06:34] the week help us and strengthen our body
[3:06:36] as we thank you and commit everything
[3:06:38] unto the hand in the name of Jesus
[3:06:41] Christ amen God bless you church we love
