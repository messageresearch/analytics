[29:37] we had to
[29:39] have a contract on the use of the
[29:40] building between four and nine pm
[29:43] so you want to be on time
[29:45] um
[29:46] we'll need everyone who can come
[29:49] to bring
[29:50] drinks

[29:54] meal
[29:55] um we also need help with serving the

[31:10] so that takes care of sister jane's
[31:11] memorial service wanna of course keep it
[31:14] in prayer that everything will be
[31:15] handled in order and um
[31:18] to be a blessing
[31:19] keeping the family in prayer constantly
[31:22] um the other thing we want to
[31:25] bring to the church this is dumb
[31:28] from our last deacons meeting we thought
[31:30] we would
[31:31] just bring a reminder of church order
[31:34] with regards to
[31:36] testimonies in the song series
[31:39] now we want every testimony
[31:42] because we know the
[31:44] believers overcome by the blood of the
[31:46] lamb and by the word of their testimony
[31:47] amen
[31:49] so we're not
[31:51] the holy spirit is not trying to we'll
[31:52] never quench testimonies
[31:54] but we thank god for the messenger he
[31:57] has given us
[31:58] and putting things in order
[32:00] is a beautiful thing if we have nothing
[32:03] to put in order we need help but we have
[32:05] something so if you can put it in order
[32:07] it all comes it all works much better
[32:09] so i just want to read like three places
[32:12] here from the
[32:13] church order
[32:15] message
[32:17] prophet was saying he said in answering
[32:19] questions this will be in your conduct
[32:21] order and doctrine book as well
[32:23] he said then you know
[32:25] people will get up and say well i tell
[32:27] you let's have a good testimony meeting
[32:29] see
[32:30] i don't mean any critics on this
[32:33] i just mean to tell you the truth i mean
[32:35] to tell you the truth see
[32:37] i found testimony meetings
[32:41] of
[32:42] they do more harm sometimes than good
[32:46] see they really do
[32:48] now if somebody
[32:50] would have a red-hot testimony in time
[32:52] of a revival you know
[32:54] you're having a revival on
[32:57] you know a meeting and somebody got
[32:58] saved and just wanted to say a word well
[33:00] bless god
[33:02] let him unload his soul
[33:05] and see if he if he wants to to do that
[33:07] see
[33:08] just in the time of our revival i just
[33:10] want to say thank god for what he has
[33:12] done for me he saved me last week and my
[33:14] hearts are burning up with the glory of
[33:16] god thanks be to god set down amen
[33:19] that's fine go on that's all
[33:22] right but when you say
[33:25] now we come on who's next who's next
[33:28] now let's let's hear a word let's hear a
[33:31] word a testimony now
[33:33] if we got a meeting set aside
[33:35] a certain night for that see you're
[33:38] going to tonight next wednesday night
[33:40] instead of praying meeting it's going to
[33:42] be a testimony meeting we want everybody
[33:44] to come in
[33:45] and it's going to be a testimonial
[33:47] meeting
[33:48] and then
[33:50] when they come to
[33:51] to the place to give testimonies read
[33:53] the word have prayed and then say now
[33:56] we have announced this it's a testimony
[33:58] night
[33:59] so let's testify for that hour and 45
[34:02] minutes or 30 minutes whatever it is
[34:04] and then go ahead see
[34:06] what i mean
[34:08] and i think it will help your
[34:10] congregation
[34:11] it will help everything all together
[34:16] amen
[34:18] amen that is good word amen
[34:21] the holy spirit likes to put things in
[34:23] order
[34:24] um
[34:26] and then
[34:27] the guideline the prophet gave about
[34:29] testimonies and even to praying we want
[34:32] to like watch our
[34:34] going into details sometimes it could
[34:37] take away from the testimony
[34:40] um
[34:43] and don't let this be cold water let us
[34:46] be
[34:46] refreshing amen
[34:50] in paragraph 167
[35:04] 167.
[35:06] so he said now
[35:07] many times that we ruin our service by a
[35:09] dragged out
[35:11] testimony meetings
[35:13] which i know i'm guilty of doing it
[35:18] and you get out when we used to have a
[35:19] street meeting
[35:21] and then we have some old brother stand
[35:22] up there and he'll stand out
[35:24] and ask him to offer word of prayer
[35:27] and he pray for the mayor of the city
[35:29] for the governor of the state for the
[35:31] president of the union and everybody
[35:33] like that and all the pastors are wrong
[35:35] you know
[35:36] everyone
[35:38] by number and sister jones in the
[35:40] hospital and things like that and people
[35:42] standing walking by on the street
[35:44] meeting
[35:45] just just keep walking you see he just
[35:46] wore them out well
[35:48] see the main thing we want
[35:50] and then he goes into the prayer um
[35:53] but we just wanted to be guided by this
[35:56] amen
[35:57] praise god
[36:02] god bless you
[36:04] as you all make your way up
[36:07] we appreciate our deacons for helping us
[36:09] come in order right we need to be in
[36:11] order
[36:12] and if i mean that's me too amen how
[36:15] many y'all need three

[1:03:03] it's an electronic tongue
[1:03:10] it's an electronic tongue
[1:03:12] and it created as much damage
[1:03:15] as the tongue you use
[1:03:20] what did you text
[1:03:21] [Music]
[1:03:23] that caused fire
[1:03:27] i didn't say anything
[1:03:33] luke chapter 16
[1:03:35] verse 22.
[1:03:37] we're laboring here
[1:03:39] once we move out of here then we get to
[1:03:41] the lake of fire then we pull up to the
[1:03:43] resurrection
[1:03:45] amen
[1:03:47] wow the ship were going this way
[1:03:50] i tried to pull it up the boss is
[1:03:51] sinking
[1:03:53] it's like in the referendum brother
[1:03:54] kelly i tried to go to red for them he
[1:03:57] pulled me to the black dog
[1:03:59] i just surrendered
[1:04:01] he turned the sheep wow
[1:04:05] amen 22 and he came to pass that the
[1:04:08] beggar died you know the story now clear
[1:04:11] now
[1:04:13] and he was and was carried by the angels
[1:04:16] into abraham's bosom you know what he
[1:04:18] means now paradise amen
[1:04:21] the rich man also died and was water
[1:04:24] the body were buried all of them stay in
[1:04:27] the earth because they came out of the
[1:04:29] earth
[1:04:30] the 16th element of the earth did the
[1:04:32] body so when you die the earth say give
[1:04:34] me what belongs to me and they keep it
[1:04:37] here then whatever goes there handle it
[1:04:40] amen
[1:04:42] verse 23 and in what in heaven
[1:04:45] so in hell
[1:04:47] not here
[1:04:48] in the sermon
[1:04:50] and in hell he lift up his eyes being in
[1:04:54] torment now you understand the hell is
[1:04:56] not burning like i wish it hurt him it's
[1:05:00] a different kind of fire when you get to
[1:05:02] the lake of fire you will understand
[1:05:04] that fire
[1:05:05] being in torment and sees abraham a
[1:05:08] pharaoh so abraham was not close
[1:05:12] abraham was somewhere there
[1:05:14] and he sees abraham
[1:05:16] and lazarus in his bosom
[1:05:19] and he cried the reason why he cried
[1:05:21] because abraham is far right
[1:05:24] and he cried and said
[1:05:27] father abraham so this is not a hidden
[1:05:29] that's a jew
[1:05:31] because the jews were claiming abraham
[1:05:32] to be their father
[1:05:34] he said father abraham naturally he can
[1:05:37] claim that spiritually it's a different
[1:05:39] story
[1:05:40] what he was claiming abraham for was in
[1:05:43] the tomb
[1:05:46] the body
[1:05:47] through the body that's abraham
[1:05:49] but through the gene he was not abraham
[1:05:52] because not all israelis
[1:05:55] you remember
[1:05:56] okay now abraham father abraham have
[1:06:00] water
[1:06:02] he's this man
[1:06:04] is in hell
[1:06:07] and in hell
[1:06:09] he's seeking for mercy
[1:06:15] to have mercy you must be a vessel of
[1:06:18] mercy you remember that to begin with
[1:06:21] and there should be a certain place
[1:06:23] where you get mercy
[1:06:25] not in hell
[1:06:26] but how does he interpret
[1:06:29] mercy in hell
[1:06:31] amen
[1:06:33] he said have mercy on me
[1:06:36] what kind of mercy do you need from
[1:06:38] abraham in hell
[1:06:40] what is mercy in hell
[1:06:44] what is the definition of mercy
[1:06:47] in hell
[1:06:48] come on
[1:06:49] and sandhu
[1:06:51] said lazarus
[1:06:53] that he may dip
[1:06:55] the tip of his finger
[1:06:58] not even a glass but just the tip you
[1:07:01] know what a tip is right just a little
[1:07:03] bit like this
[1:07:05] the tip
[1:07:06] of his finger in water
[1:07:09] and cool my
[1:07:12] so mercy for him in hell
[1:07:16] is
[1:07:17] to get water
[1:07:23] father abraham if you want to show me
[1:07:25] mercy this is what i interpret mercy in
[1:07:28] hell
[1:07:29] mercy in here i need water
[1:07:33] if you can send lazarus to get me water
[1:07:36] not a glass of water
[1:07:38] just in the tip
[1:07:41] it's it's it won't be interpreted to me
[1:07:44] as mercy
[1:07:48] let me read it again
[1:07:51] at the opening of the seven seal
[1:07:53] [Laughter]
[1:07:55] the bible become anew
[1:07:58] have mercy on me and send lazarus that
[1:08:02] he may dip the tip of his finger in
[1:08:05] water
[1:08:06] in water and drink
[1:08:12] do what do you have your bible
[1:08:14] everybody got a rubber and do water
[1:08:18] so the water he's looking is not even
[1:08:20] for drinking
[1:08:24] it is a water not to drink
[1:08:26] anymore
[1:08:28] because he passed the time of drinking
[1:08:35] we okay
[1:08:36] now it's the time only to cool
[1:08:43] water to cool
[1:08:45] to cold water
[1:08:47] why he didn't want to cool his head
[1:08:54] why he didn't want to call his body
[1:08:58] what is in the tongue
[1:09:00] that is most important than the head
[1:09:06] what is in the tongue that is most
[1:09:08] important than your hand
[1:09:10] what is in the tongue that is most
[1:09:12] important than the entire body
[1:09:16] his whole body was in torment his all
[1:09:19] spirit into man and the only member that
[1:09:22] he can remember is only the tongue
[1:09:29] whether it's a natural or your
[1:09:31] electronic
[1:09:32] tongue you're going to remember it in
[1:09:35] hell
[1:09:35] [Music]
[1:09:37] keep talking
[1:09:39] keep proving
[1:09:40] keep showing people who you are
[1:09:43] keep bragging
[1:09:44] you're going to brag in hell
[1:09:51] amen
[1:09:52] to cool my tongue for i am tormented in
[1:09:56] this flame i'm not burning
[1:09:58] everybody clear tormented it needs for
[1:10:01] but abraham said son
[1:10:04] remember that you in your lifetime
[1:10:06] receive your good things
[1:10:08] and likewise lazarus evil things in
[1:10:11] other words everybody got their portion
[1:10:14] but now
[1:10:15] in this circumstance
[1:10:17] he is comforted
[1:10:18] so in paradise you get comfort
[1:10:21] and you are tormented in hell there is
[1:10:24] no comfort it's torment
[1:10:27] and beside all this between us and you
[1:10:31] there is a great goal fixed it's an
[1:10:34] extension
[1:10:35] so that death which will pass from here
[1:10:39] to you cannot neither can they pass to
[1:10:41] us that would come from there in other
[1:10:44] words the mercy you're looking for in
[1:10:47] hell
[1:10:48] doesn't exist
[1:10:51] why because there is no communication
[1:10:54] that's why you far over there and if you
[1:10:56] look between us and you
[1:10:58] there is a line a separating line there
[1:11:02] is a gulf i cannot come there you cannot
[1:11:04] come here in other words hell have no
[1:11:07] mercy
[1:11:11] everybody clear
[1:11:13] let's go to first peter chapter 3 that
[1:11:16] we're going to pray
[1:11:18] hallelujah

[1:20:36] and if the lamb gets you pretty good you
[1:20:39] say forgive him
[1:20:41] because he doesn't know what he's doing
[1:20:46] let's go back to first peter
[1:20:52] why the tongue in hell

[1:21:10] tongue
[1:21:12] you need a coat to see me
[1:21:14] amen
[1:21:18] all right
[1:21:19] verse 9 not rendering evil what i'm
[1:21:22] saying here i wish you can go back again
[1:21:25] and listen to this over again that's the
[1:21:27] behavior in this church
[1:21:30] not rendering evil for evil
[1:21:34] or rolling for railing but contraries
[1:21:37] doing water
[1:21:41] knowing that you are
[1:21:43] there unto water
[1:21:45] so you are called to do what
[1:21:50] what is your calling to do what
[1:21:53] blessing amen
[1:21:55] that you should inherit the water
[1:22:00] call for blessing to bless to inherit
[1:22:03] blessing
[1:22:04] so you are blessed
[1:22:07] verse 10
[1:22:08] for he
[1:22:09] that will love water
[1:22:11] how many want to leave
[1:22:14] let me see your hand
[1:22:16] anybody want to leave
[1:22:18] some people want to die
[1:22:20] who want to leave

[1:22:30] for he that will love life come on and
[1:22:33] see water
[1:22:34] how many want to see good days

[1:22:51] can you read your scripture
[1:22:52] let him do what
[1:22:54] refrain water
[1:23:00] did they say refrain his eyes
[1:23:03] let him refrain water
[1:23:05] why the tongue in hell

[1:23:12] hold the key to a good life
[1:23:18] the key to good days
[1:23:22] the key to blessings

[1:24:23] father if we stuck
[1:24:26] in our intellect
[1:24:28] we can miss your message
[1:24:31] and don't even understand
[1:24:33] that there is no rebuke
[1:24:35] it is just a love
[1:24:37] and sometimes it appear in the form of a
[1:24:40] rebuke
[1:24:41] if your children can only understand
[1:24:44] that no one is rebuked
[1:24:46] it is the love of the father telling
[1:24:48] them this morning
[1:24:50] that look at this area
[1:24:53] i want you to watch this area
[1:24:55] and i want you to correct this area
[1:24:58] because most of your trouble are coming
[1:25:00] from this area
[1:25:02] if they can only understand that that
[1:25:04] way
[1:25:05] and take me off the scene
[1:25:08] father
[1:25:09] granted unto them the blessing that is
[1:25:12] connected to that obedience
[1:25:14] lord be the alpha and the omega of this
[1:25:18] service
[1:25:19] father speak to us may you seal the
[1:25:21] devil completely out

[1:25:26] going to be ministering to your children
[1:25:29] i rebuke every demonic spirit that is
[1:25:32] trying to bother the mind of the people
[1:25:34] even those that are going to listen to
[1:25:36] this sermon later on father may you
[1:25:38] protect their mind may they be able to
[1:25:41] discern and catch the man of christ and
[1:25:44] understand that the judge who come is
[1:25:47] not coming to judge them but he want to
[1:25:50] judge the sin that have been bordering
[1:25:53] them for years
[1:25:55] father are committed unto the hand in
[1:25:58] the name of jesus christ
[1:26:00] amen amen
[1:26:02] you already been seated
[1:26:05] we are dealing with the second banquet
[1:26:07] of esther
[1:26:09] we on part 14 we still under the second
[1:26:12] death
[1:26:13] because to understand the second death
[1:26:15] you must understand the lake of fire and
[1:26:18] go to hell and understand hell and the
[1:26:21] best way to understand here
[1:26:23] you have to go through the lake of fire
[1:26:24] everybody clear
[1:26:26] my subject today is the tongue and hell
[1:26:31] because we see this morning the young
[1:26:33] rich ruler is in hell but he also
[1:26:36] unfolded to us something in hell which
[1:26:40] is the tongue
[1:26:41] we know now when you die when you go if
[1:26:43] you're sinner or if you're a scent we
[1:26:46] understand that part we understand where
[1:26:48] the body goes we understand where the
[1:26:50] spirit and the soul goes we understand
[1:26:52] all this part that hell is not burning
[1:26:55] but hair is a torment place it's the
[1:26:58] chance of darkness it's the chance of
[1:27:01] circumstances it's a dimension that you
[1:27:04] are caught between the earth and between
[1:27:06] heaven everybody clear so far
[1:27:08] now as we begin to go
[1:27:11] we are again back again in this story of
[1:27:14] the rich young ruler hey barclay
[1:27:17] brother robert pointed this to me
[1:27:19] that when you pull this picture that you
[1:27:22] see here
[1:27:23] the hoffman head of christ here
[1:27:26] this picture is just a snapshot
[1:27:29] of this picture right here anybody clear
[1:27:33] so the whole plain view of this photo
[1:27:37] this picture is right there
[1:27:39] so it's really was painted
[1:27:43] as jesus christ
[1:27:45] and the rich young ruler
[1:27:47] amen
[1:27:48] so what they did they just cut the head
[1:27:51] of christ and pull it up and that's what
[1:27:53] you have
[1:27:54] but if you pull the whole picture the
[1:27:56] panoramic view
[1:27:58] it belongs to the rich young ruler
[1:28:03] and for some reason this painter by the
[1:28:06] name of offman
[1:28:07] painted the rich young ruler
[1:28:11] he didn't paint moses
[1:28:14] he didn't parent abraham
[1:28:17] the inspiration struck this man
[1:28:20] only to paint the witch young ruler
[1:28:23] and the amazing part on this picture
[1:28:26] we know that the rich young ruler went
[1:28:28] to hell
[1:28:30] and in hell there was no mercy
[1:28:32] anybody clear so far when you look at
[1:28:35] the head of christ
[1:28:37] you will notice that the direction he's
[1:28:39] looking at the rich young ruler is to
[1:28:42] the left
[1:28:43] [Music]
[1:28:46] are you awake
[1:28:48] are you awake
[1:28:49] are you awake because remember in the
[1:28:52] judgment of the white
[1:28:54] throne some people will be on the right
[1:28:57] side
[1:28:58] and other people will be on the left
[1:29:01] side
[1:29:02] and those on the right side will be as
[1:29:04] lamb
[1:29:06] and those on the left side will be as
[1:29:08] good and when he was talking to the
[1:29:12] young witch ruler it seems like his head
[1:29:15] was turned to the left side
[1:29:18] ever here
[1:29:19] but in this end time when he came down
[1:29:24] hallelujah his head was looking to the
[1:29:27] right
[1:29:28] [Applause]
[1:29:31] hallelujah so the coming of the crowd
[1:29:34] is not to go after the seed of satan but
[1:29:38] god is looking for the predestinated
[1:29:41] seed that was predestinated before the
[1:29:44] foundation of the world
[1:29:49] hallelujah
[1:29:50] brother branham said that when he came
[1:29:53] down he was looking to the right at the
[1:29:56] direction of the fifth that was safe at
[1:30:00] the cross
[1:30:01] in other words god is coming and he's
[1:30:04] seeking his seed
[1:30:06] god is seeking his children
[1:30:08] god is coming to take you
[1:30:11] he's not dealing with the other seed
[1:30:14] anymore but he's dealing with his own
[1:30:16] blood the bride of the lord jesus christ
[1:30:20] we just sons and daughters of god that
[1:30:23] were predestinated before the foundation
[1:30:27] of the world
[1:30:28] everybody here so far
[1:30:30] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:30:34] hallelujah let's give the lord a club
[1:30:37] this morning
[1:30:38] [Applause]
[1:30:43] hallelujah
[1:30:45] everybody cleared so far
[1:30:47] yeah we just left the airport
[1:30:49] we just left the airport now we're going
[1:30:52] up so keep your seatbelt because the
[1:30:54] airplane is like this
[1:30:56] everybody clear so let's climb a little
[1:30:59] bit blessed be the name of the lord we
[1:31:02] found out since we started
[1:31:04] that according to luke chapter 12
[1:31:07] that the bible says that be not afraid
[1:31:10] of them that killed the body
[1:31:13] and after have no more they can do but
[1:31:16] be afraid of whom
[1:31:18] who after he has killed has power to
[1:31:21] cast in water
[1:31:23] depending if you lost you automatically
[1:31:26] go to hell
[1:31:28] but if you are safe like our sister gene
[1:31:32] today she's in the presence of the lord
[1:31:35] everybody so far in matthew 10 verse 28
[1:31:39] and fear not them which killed the body
[1:31:42] but are not able to kill the soul but
[1:31:45] rather feel him which is able to destroy
[1:31:47] both the water
[1:31:49] the soul and the body in water
[1:31:52] you know what the hell mean already
[1:31:53] everybody clear so far as we continue to
[1:31:56] climb we found out that brother branham
[1:31:59] said don't let that be to us
[1:32:01] this is our visitation time that's why
[1:32:03] the cloud came looking at the right
[1:32:06] it is the time of our visitation
[1:32:09] god came down to visit me like he came
[1:32:12] to visit abraham
[1:32:16] hallelujah
[1:32:17] he came one time in genesis 18
[1:32:21] to pay a visit to abraham
[1:32:24] hallelujah and in genesis 18 he never
[1:32:28] used the body of jesus christ
[1:32:31] he borrowed a different body
[1:32:33] to pay a visit to abraham
[1:32:36] and as he was in the day of lord
[1:32:39] so was it in the end time
[1:32:42] when god came to abraham he gave sarah
[1:32:45] the back
[1:32:48] [Music]
[1:32:51] hallelujah
[1:32:52] hallelujah that's why when god came in
[1:32:55] this end time
[1:32:57] he also stood and borrowed a body and
[1:33:00] that's why brother branham said i lose
[1:33:02] myself
[1:33:04] i am out
[1:33:05] he is in and brother branham can turn
[1:33:08] and begin to do the discernment
[1:33:11] telling you the seed of abraham i have
[1:33:14] come to visit you
[1:33:16] i have come to talk to you i have come
[1:33:18] to bring a body change
[1:33:22] [Applause]
[1:33:29] this message is yummy
[1:33:32] [Applause]
[1:33:39] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:33:42] this is our visitation time
[1:33:45] let's remember who
[1:33:50] that he is the water
[1:33:52] the same yesterday today and what
[1:33:55] hebrew 13 8 don't wait till some region
[1:33:59] yonder
[1:34:00] in the damn in that dimension where you
[1:34:03] cannot go in the presence of god and
[1:34:06] your time is up on earth
[1:34:08] in the nightmare of oral
[1:34:11] horror you shall remember
[1:34:13] you had your your opportunity and turn
[1:34:16] it away like the rich young ruler let
[1:34:19] the young people take notice to this
[1:34:22] let's all take notice to it
[1:34:25] because this is our visitation everybody
[1:34:28] here
[1:34:29] then when we enter hell
[1:34:32] we found out that jesus unfolded to us
[1:34:35] that's not only is he torment in hell
[1:34:39] but hell also got warm
[1:34:42] you remember last sunday
[1:34:44] all right
[1:34:45] if
[1:34:46] the hand offended cut it off
[1:34:49] it is better for thee to enter into life
[1:34:52] maimed
[1:34:53] than having two hands to go to hell into
[1:34:56] the fire
[1:34:57] we know that fire
[1:34:59] torment
[1:35:00] that never shall be quenched where the
[1:35:03] worm your own worm
[1:35:05] dies not and the fire is not quenched
[1:35:09] and we found out last sunday that's the
[1:35:12] only way you can block the worm
[1:35:15] you must be taken and put in the
[1:35:17] presence of the king when you are
[1:35:20] entered in the holy of the holy spunk
[1:35:28] and never brought worm those worm was
[1:35:31] forever sealed and never to be activated
[1:35:35] [Laughter]
[1:35:37] hallelujah
[1:35:39] now brother branham said the judgment is
[1:35:42] not now
[1:35:43] it's in the white throne and there is no
[1:35:46] burning hell now now the scripture now
[1:35:48] clearly stated that in her inhale the
[1:35:51] fire or the flame are tormenting they
[1:35:54] are not burning everybody clear
[1:35:56] and somebody tell you the guy is in
[1:35:59] burning hell now that is wrong
[1:36:02] but bottom is correct
[1:36:04] a judge of this earth is just enough to
[1:36:07] never condemn a man until he's brought
[1:36:09] to trial
[1:36:11] and god will never throw a man in the
[1:36:13] fiery furnace which is the lake of fire
[1:36:16] until first he is condemned by god's own
[1:36:20] law
[1:36:21] he rejected water
[1:36:23] there's no mercy in here so you see he
[1:36:26] first have to have a trial and the trial
[1:36:29] is the great white throne judgment but
[1:36:32] now he's in the place called a prison
[1:36:34] water so hair is a prison that you are
[1:36:38] placed temporarily in torment
[1:36:41] everybody clear until the judgment
[1:36:44] before you go into the lake of fire
[1:36:46] everybody clear
[1:36:48] now we found in hell
[1:36:50] here that the rich young ruler is
[1:36:54] talking about the tongue
[1:36:57] what is really going on with the tongue
[1:36:59] in here
[1:37:01] everybody clear
[1:37:03] usually there is three ways
[1:37:07] the bible explains this
[1:37:09] sometimes the scripture called math
[1:37:14] everybody
[1:37:15] sometimes the scriptures say tongue
[1:37:19] sometimes the scriptures say lips
[1:37:24] all three
[1:37:25] are speaking about the same thing
[1:37:29] everybody clear
[1:37:32] hallelujah
[1:37:33] in the book of luke
[1:37:35] chapter one
[1:37:36] when the angel gabriel came to zechariah
[1:37:40] the angel came and spoke to zechariah
[1:37:44] and said you're gonna have a child and
[1:37:46] zechariah and elizabeth were old
[1:37:49] and zechariah began to doubt
[1:37:52] the angel's message
[1:37:54] and when zechariah began to doubt
[1:37:58] something happened and the angel told
[1:38:00] him or brought a judgment on him
[1:38:04] the bible said and behold
[1:38:07] that shall be what
[1:38:11] let's look at the word dumb
[1:38:13] in the scripture
[1:38:17] hallelujah
[1:38:18] and behold that shall be done
[1:38:22] definition from the scripture from the
[1:38:25] message from the scripture from the
[1:38:26] message
[1:38:28] the the word interpreting the word
[1:38:31] [Music]
[1:38:32] and behold that shall be dumb
[1:38:35] and not be able to do whatever so a dumb
[1:38:38] man doesn't speak
[1:38:42] if you don't speak what is it block
[1:38:46] your tongue
[1:38:48] your mouth
[1:38:49] your lip
[1:38:50] let's continue
[1:38:52] until the day that these things shall be
[1:38:55] performed
[1:38:56] because that belief is not
[1:38:58] my word which shall be fulfilled in this
[1:39:01] season
[1:39:02] a message right there
[1:39:04] you drop down to verse 63
[1:39:08] when john the baptist was born
[1:39:10] they came and they asked
[1:39:12] what is the name of the boy
[1:39:14] remember zechariah was not speaking at
[1:39:17] all
[1:39:18] amen
[1:39:19] and elizabeth
[1:39:21] when he was talking to zachariah
[1:39:23] zechariah was a zekra
[1:39:28] that's the way he was talking
[1:39:30] anybody here
[1:39:32] for a long time through the whole
[1:39:34] pregnancy
[1:39:37] are you okay
[1:39:38] mm-hmm we're going to church
[1:39:42] what do you do
[1:39:42] [Music]
[1:39:44] that's it
[1:39:48] so the child is born they say who is
[1:39:51] what is the name of the child
[1:39:53] elizabeth say his name is what
[1:39:56] let me ask a question where did that
[1:39:58] name come from
[1:39:59] [Music]
[1:40:02] because that name was given to zechariah
[1:40:06] by the angel
[1:40:08] elizabeth was not there
[1:40:14] are we okay
[1:40:16] one elite when zechariah left
[1:40:19] his mouth
[1:40:20] was how did he communicate
[1:40:24] with elizabeth the name
[1:40:26] [Music]
[1:40:29] you can talk you don't know how to
[1:40:31] communicate with your wife
[1:40:33] [Music]
[1:40:38] a dumb man
[1:40:40] knows how to communicate with his wife
[1:40:43] until his wife understands that the name
[1:40:46] of the child is john
[1:40:48] [Music]
[1:40:52] she doesn't understand me she doesn't
[1:40:54] understand me
[1:40:56] how are you communicating
[1:40:59] when you have a tongue
[1:41:05] let me stay on the highway
[1:41:07] [Laughter]
[1:41:09] are you there
[1:41:11] are you there
[1:41:12] are you there to show you a perfect
[1:41:15] marriage
[1:41:18] when the husband is weak
[1:41:20] they know how to communicate
[1:41:29] the sickness
[1:41:30] of the husband
[1:41:32] the condition of the husband never broke
[1:41:35] the intimacy
[1:41:39] he was not a hindrance to their marital
[1:41:42] life
[1:41:44] they managed to find a way
[1:41:46] to communicate under the circumstances
[1:41:57] hallelujah
[1:41:58] so one they brought the child
[1:42:01] say john they said
[1:42:04] we never heard such a name in our family
[1:42:07] ask daddy
[1:42:09] daddy you're the head
[1:42:10] tell us what is the name they're asking
[1:42:13] a dumb man
[1:42:14] what does he do what can he do
[1:42:18] [Music]
[1:42:20] he says oh he looks like he needs
[1:42:21] something to write
[1:42:23] and he asked for a writing table
[1:42:26] and wrote saying his name is who
[1:42:29] perfectly with his wife
[1:42:31] so when you go to the wife you ask john
[1:42:34] you go to the husband john you cannot
[1:42:36] get between that marriage
[1:42:43] same language
[1:42:45] not the wife doing this and the husband
[1:42:48] doing this
[1:42:51] hallelujah
[1:42:52] and they marvel all
[1:42:55] now they got a confirmation
[1:42:57] and his water
[1:42:59] so damn
[1:43:01] affect the mouth
[1:43:05] here
[1:43:07] his mouth was open immediately and his
[1:43:11] water
[1:43:12] was water and he did water so to speak
[1:43:16] you need all these three here
[1:43:21] [Music]
[1:43:22] close your mouth and try to speak with
[1:43:24] your tongue
[1:43:26] go ahead try right now
[1:43:28] close your lips and try to speak with
[1:43:30] your tongue
[1:43:31] i can't get it so your mouth needs to
[1:43:34] operate
[1:43:35] and your lips need to operate and your
[1:43:38] tongue to operate then you produce
[1:43:40] speech
[1:43:44] i leave the other part
[1:43:47] because your teeth need to be involved
[1:43:48] too
[1:43:53] and his back and praise god so when we
[1:43:57] talk about the tongue
[1:43:59] we're referring to not only the tongue
[1:44:02] itself but we're looking at the mouth
[1:44:05] the lips and the tongue together
[1:44:07] everybody clear so far
[1:44:09] now in the natural the bible say in
[1:44:11] isaiah when the poor and me the sick
[1:44:15] water
[1:44:16] and there is none and their tongue fell
[1:44:19] for what
[1:44:21] i the lord will heal them and i i the
[1:44:25] god of israel will not forsake them so
[1:44:28] naturally speaking here we found out
[1:44:31] that when somebody's tested thirsty for
[1:44:34] water he affects their tongue
[1:44:38] anybody okay so far
[1:44:40] now the problem is
[1:44:43] the rich young ruler is not on the earth
[1:44:48] everybody here his body
[1:44:51] stay on the earth
[1:44:53] that's where he was back buried on the
[1:44:55] earth
[1:44:56] what one to have
[1:44:59] is his spirit
[1:45:01] and his water
[1:45:04] can a spirit drink water
[1:45:07] can a soul drink water
[1:45:09] what kind of water was he looking for
[1:45:14] [Music]
[1:45:16] we okay
[1:45:17] continue to keep your seat belt
[1:45:19] everybody here
[1:45:21] in luke chapter 24 verse 36 the bible
[1:45:24] said and as they got speak
[1:45:27] jesus himself stood in the midst of him
[1:45:30] and said unto them peace be unto you but
[1:45:33] robert jumped to the inland
[1:45:35] but they were terrified and a frightened
[1:45:38] and supposed that they have seen a
[1:45:42] water they have seen a spirit
[1:45:47] what is the characteristic of a spirit
[1:45:51] ever here and he said unto them why are
[1:45:54] you troubled and why do thoughts arise
[1:45:57] in your heart
[1:45:58] behold my hand
[1:46:00] and my feet
[1:46:01] that is i
[1:46:03] myself
[1:46:04] handle me
[1:46:06] and see for a while
[1:46:08] has water
[1:46:10] and water
[1:46:12] so if you see a spooky spirit you hit
[1:46:14] him
[1:46:16] he has flesh and bone it's not a spirit
[1:46:19] by the word
[1:46:23] no bones
[1:46:25] no flesh
[1:46:27] so in hell
[1:46:30] no born
[1:46:32] no flesh
[1:46:35] when you have born and flesh what does
[1:46:37] he do to you
[1:46:38] for a spirit has no flesh and bone as he
[1:46:41] must have you may see me have and when
[1:46:45] he that spoken he showed them his hand
[1:46:48] and his feet
[1:46:49] why his hand and his feet
[1:46:51] because they were
[1:46:54] they were
[1:46:56] scars so spirits do have scar
[1:47:03] and while they yet believe not
[1:47:07] for joy and wonder he
[1:47:09] said unto them have ye here any water
[1:47:13] and they gave him a piece of water a
[1:47:16] broad fish and off a water
[1:47:19] and he took it and
[1:47:21] to prove to them that a spirit cannot
[1:47:24] eat
[1:47:27] the young rich ruler looking for water
[1:47:30] but what he is in here he is in here
[1:47:34] wrong theophany
[1:47:36] which is housing his spirit and his soul
[1:47:40] because when we die in our tabernacle
[1:47:43] dissolve here we get into another car
[1:47:46] and then you have to ride whether you're
[1:47:48] going to ride in heaven or you will be
[1:47:50] riding on the highway of hell
[1:47:53] everybody
[1:47:54] so water in the scripture have two
[1:47:58] meanings
[1:48:00] when we talk about god
[1:48:02] water
[1:48:03] sometimes speak of the spirit
[1:48:06] and water speak of the world
[1:48:10] everybody here i will pour out my spirit
[1:48:13] amen remember in referendum moses have
[1:48:16] to take the road and smart the rock and
[1:48:19] what and water came out of it
[1:48:21] ever clear
[1:48:23] or by the washing off the water by the
[1:48:26] world
[1:48:27] so
[1:48:28] inhale here
[1:48:30] what is it the spirit
[1:48:33] or is it the word
[1:48:36] everybody here so far
[1:48:38] blessed be the name of the lord brother
[1:48:40] of adam said there was a time that the
[1:48:42] people didn't go in the presence of god
[1:48:45] when they die they justify right
[1:48:50] that was in the water
[1:48:52] not now our sister straight in the
[1:48:55] presence of god
[1:48:56] amen
[1:48:57] so if somebody comes and tell you they
[1:48:59] seen her
[1:49:01] they see somebody else
[1:49:03] not here
[1:49:05] amen you can't see her the only way you
[1:49:07] can see her you must be there
[1:49:13] they went into a place called water
[1:49:16] paradise the bosom of abraham and there
[1:49:20] the souls of the just wedded in paradise
[1:49:24] but paradise was a place where god kept
[1:49:28] the souls
[1:49:29] like in the water
[1:49:31] because christians sleep
[1:49:36] every year that's why when they wake up
[1:49:39] at the resurrection they are waking up
[1:49:42] like out of sleep
[1:49:44] like oh and if you tell her sister
[1:49:47] gene you died so and so she said no
[1:49:50] i remember it was yesterday i just came
[1:49:52] up
[1:49:55] when she was going she enter into her
[1:49:59] into a stream
[1:50:00] and she goes back and she sits into a
[1:50:03] sweet dream
[1:50:06] your time doesn't affect her anymore
[1:50:09] [Applause]
[1:50:10] when she woke up at the resurrection
[1:50:13] it's like when you went to bed at
[1:50:16] 11 o'clock and you woke up at in the
[1:50:18] morning that's the way she's waking up
[1:50:21] she'll be like oh okay
[1:50:23] you say no you know he was in 2000
[1:50:26] i just went to i remember when i went
[1:50:28] there
[1:50:31] hallelujah
[1:50:32] but paradise was a place where god kept
[1:50:36] the soul like in a dreamland until the
[1:50:38] water
[1:50:40] the blood of jesus christ was shed
[1:50:43] why for the blood of bulls and goats
[1:50:46] would not take away sin he only covered
[1:50:50] sin but jesus blood take away water
[1:50:55] what does he mean the blood of bulls and
[1:50:57] goats
[1:51:00] what does he mean
[1:51:02] hallelujah
[1:51:03] in john 7 verse 37 the bible said in the
[1:51:07] last day
[1:51:08] the great day of the feast
[1:51:10] jesus stood jesus living
[1:51:13] and christ saying if any man person
[1:51:16] let him come unto me and do what
[1:51:19] the only time you can drink you must be
[1:51:21] alive
[1:51:22] [Music]
[1:51:26] don't wait till you get to hell
[1:51:29] because in hell there is no more
[1:51:31] opportunity to drink
[1:51:35] everybody here
[1:51:37] he that believes on me
[1:51:40] as the scripture have said
[1:51:42] out of his water
[1:51:45] not this berry
[1:51:46] you know that belly right
[1:51:49] out of his belly shall flow water
[1:51:52] reverse your foot
[1:51:54] so if you receive jesus christ
[1:51:58] do you follow me
[1:52:00] do you follow me out of your heart
[1:52:04] you have rivers of water
[1:52:08] that's why he says
[1:52:11] where was lazarus getting the water
[1:52:21] they were in hell where was water
[1:52:24] [Music]
[1:52:26] it was dealing with the spirit and the
[1:52:28] soul
[1:52:29] your soul
[1:52:31] becomes a river
[1:52:35] of water
[1:52:37] temporary or
[1:52:39] permanently cooling your tongue
[1:52:45] [Music]
[1:52:49] are we okay
[1:52:50] is it too much
[1:52:52] can we continue to come keep your seat
[1:52:54] belt i'll tell you where to take it
[1:52:56] off are you there
[1:52:59] he that believes on me as the scripture
[1:53:02] has said out of his belly shall flow
[1:53:04] rivers of water
[1:53:06] but
[1:53:07] this speaking of the water
[1:53:10] which day that belief on him should
[1:53:13] water
[1:53:14] so water speaking of the water
[1:53:17] for there
[1:53:19] was not yet water
[1:53:24] so this water that he was looking for
[1:53:28] could not be this
[1:53:31] because christ was not dead yet
[1:53:34] he was in paradise
[1:53:38] are we okay now are we clear now
[1:53:41] so now he's left with one option
[1:53:43] which is the water
[1:53:47] for the holy ghost was not yet given
[1:53:49] because jesus was not yet water
[1:53:52] that's why when he was glorified he said
[1:53:54] now go wait in the upper room i am
[1:53:57] coming down bringing now though
[1:54:04] continue with your question

[2:01:27] the heat in the head
[2:01:29] the hit on the feet
[2:01:30] the hit on his arm
[2:01:32] why the heat of the tongue was the
[2:01:35] highest heat

[2:01:40] the whole body is wet
[2:01:45] everybody follow me
[2:01:47] everybody follow me
[2:01:51] i'm gonna drop something here
[2:01:54] brother branham says this
[2:01:56] how much faith can you use
[2:01:59] the trouble of it is today
[2:02:01] that i have found i said the other night
[2:02:05] two different classes of people
[2:02:08] one of them is a fundamental
[2:02:12] fundamentalist
[2:02:14] who is a fundamentalist
[2:02:16] i want you to stay awake i'm pleading
[2:02:19] with you
[2:02:20] are you there
[2:02:21] a
[2:02:22] a fundamentalist is who
[2:02:25] a fundamentalist positionally
[2:02:29] they know what they are
[2:02:34] and one who's fundamentalists know who
[2:02:37] they are
[2:02:39] are you there
[2:02:41] the next is the pentecost
[2:02:45] the fundamentalist and the pentecostal
[2:02:49] the pentecost don't have the faith
[2:02:53] the fundamentalists
[2:02:55] have the position truth
[2:02:58] so one have faith
[2:03:01] one
[2:03:02] knows the position
[2:03:05] but he doesn't have faith
[2:03:07] the other one have faith
[2:03:10] but he doesn't know who they are
[2:03:14] [Music]
[2:03:15] hallelujah
[2:03:17] they believe it
[2:03:19] now but the fundamentalist does not have
[2:03:22] any faith to operate what they believe
[2:03:25] they are
[2:03:26] they pentecostal has it but don't know
[2:03:30] who they are
[2:03:34] take your eyes off the denomination
[2:03:37] this happened in the message
[2:03:41] [Music]
[2:03:45] hallelujah
[2:03:46] it's just like a man
[2:03:49] who has a lot of money in the bank
[2:03:52] but he can't write a what
[2:03:54] that's the fundamentalist
[2:03:58] he's just bragging
[2:04:00] he's just bragging i have a lot of money
[2:04:02] i have a lot of money i have a lot of
[2:04:04] money i have a lot of money okay prove

[2:04:16] christ we are the bride of jesus christ
[2:04:19] prove me your brother
[2:04:20] [Music]
[2:04:21] [Applause]
[2:04:32] are you there
[2:04:34] are you there
[2:04:35] the second one
[2:04:37] is the other one can write a check but
[2:04:40] he ain't got water
[2:04:43] he always brag about power
[2:04:47] how the lord did this that i did this to

[2:04:56] gonna have bmw this this this this this
[2:04:59] no money
[2:05:00] credit low
[2:05:10] credit low that's why they have a
[2:05:13] tendency to go under depression
[2:05:16] because they brag too much and when they
[2:05:19] don't get what they were bragging they
[2:05:21] go like am i doing something wrong
[2:05:25] they told me to do this to do this to do
[2:05:27] this i did all of them i spoke in tongue
[2:05:29] i cried we cried we we i was rolling on
[2:05:32] the floor but
[2:05:34] i don't i can't get what i'm looking for
[2:05:40] before you know it you're going to go
[2:05:41] after people
[2:05:43] oh so i saw his power
[2:05:45] so i saw him power so and so her power
[2:05:48] so it's over oh over there they have
[2:05:50] power you go there over there they have
[2:05:52] power pentecostal don't know no money in
[2:05:55] their car
[2:05:56] in the message church
[2:05:58] the other one a lot of money don't know
[2:06:01] how to operate what he's talking about
[2:06:07] if i could ever get them together
[2:06:12] brother the millennium was started
[2:06:16] why this old nation will see something
[2:06:20] shaking like he never seen before
[2:06:23] sun and wonder will appear from
[2:06:26] everywhere
[2:06:27] if i could ever get fundamental faith
[2:06:30] and pentecostal people or pentecost of
[2:06:34] faith and fundamental water if you can
[2:06:37] bring those two together
[2:06:41] it's an explosion
[2:06:45] hallelujah
[2:06:47] i have often said i found two classes of
[2:06:51] people and being kind of a tutor as a
[2:06:54] baptist and make me just a little
[2:06:57] calvinist
[2:06:58] so they're not the extreme side but i
[2:07:00] said i found two type of people and one
[2:07:03] of them is pentecostal or full gospel
[2:07:05] it's called and the other is
[2:07:07] fundamentalist now the fundamental is
[2:07:10] positionally
[2:07:12] knows where he is placing christ jesus
[2:07:15] but he has not went
[2:07:19] it's more clarity now
[2:07:21] deep enough to have water
[2:07:24] he stopped at the intellectual knowledge
[2:07:29] never get deep enough so that
[2:07:33] intellectual knowledge become a reality
[2:07:40] with what we got and the pentecostal has
[2:07:43] went far enough
[2:07:45] to the born-again experience and the
[2:07:47] holy spirit but he is not fundamental
[2:07:50] enough to know his position
[2:07:53] he's shooting everywhere
[2:07:56] you demon of this you demon of this i
[2:07:59] catch you go
[2:08:00] back to the job places that's what
[2:08:02] pentecostal do
[2:08:04] you abandon you
[2:08:06] i bind you i release you to hell
[2:08:13] because he doesn't know who he is
[2:08:16] did you see jesus saying abandon devil
[2:08:18] abandon abandon and are taking you now
[2:08:21] now i'm carrying you now i'm throwing
[2:08:23] you to death did you see jesus doing
[2:08:26] that
[2:08:27] jesus knew who he was
[2:08:31] one word
[2:08:33] god
[2:08:42] [Music]
[2:08:44] you see what you have in the message i'm
[2:08:46] speaking this i'm speaking this i'm
[2:08:48] speaking this enthusiasm all the time
[2:08:51] before you know it depression
[2:08:58] church i'm helping you
[2:09:00] i'm taking all those further away
[2:09:05] check somebody who's sleeping beside you

[2:09:13] everybody
[2:09:15] are you there
[2:09:17] are you there
[2:09:18] blessed be the name of the lord brother
[2:09:21] branham continue he said but the only
[2:09:24] thing i have found as i travel
[2:09:26] i found two type of different type of
[2:09:29] people one of them is the fundamentalist
[2:09:32] the other is pentecostal the
[2:09:33] fundamentalist positionally
[2:09:36] knows their place in water
[2:09:40] by what
[2:09:41] why did we teach you origin
[2:09:49] why did we teach you origin in this
[2:09:52] church
[2:09:53] why did the holy ghost want you to know
[2:09:55] your origin
[2:09:57] so that you can be fundamentally
[2:10:00] anchor in the world
[2:10:02] [Applause]
[2:10:06] [Music]
[2:10:08] but they don't have too much water
[2:10:11] now a second step is often opening the
[2:10:14] pentecostal have a lot of faith but i
[2:10:16] don't know there
[2:10:18] what a promise
[2:10:20] in dealing with the pentecostal people
[2:10:23] if god willing when coming back i have
[2:10:25] found a weak spot of pentecostal people
[2:10:29] by god's help
[2:10:31] that is you are waters
[2:10:33] [Applause]
[2:10:35] i thought the pentecostal had faith
[2:10:38] so truly it is not faith
[2:10:41] the faith with scare is an intellectual
[2:10:44] faith
[2:10:49] you have the brain
[2:10:51] and you have the heart
[2:10:53] when they say somebody have faith and is
[2:10:55] scared faith is here
[2:10:58] and here it's fear
[2:11:01] all uncertainty
[2:11:03] and this is the one that drove the sheep
[2:11:07] so he can say i believe it brother i
[2:11:09] believe it brother i believe it but i
[2:11:11] believe it brother
[2:11:12] but that day
[2:11:16] did you hear what the doctor said
[2:11:19] so go ahead and go ahead and fill up the
[2:11:21] prescription first

[2:11:26] fill up the prescription then keep
[2:11:27] taking we know god will heal you
[2:11:30] hallelujah
[2:11:33] that's you are scared that's right that
[2:11:35] is true you are just scared to do it
[2:11:40] keep that in mind and you don't know who
[2:11:43] you are

[2:11:48] so knowing who you are
[2:11:52] help you
[2:11:53] understand your father
[2:11:55] [Music]
[2:11:58] and help you take your father at his

[2:12:58] they have to break that horse not that
[2:13:00] they're breaking their bond but they
[2:13:02] have to master
[2:13:03] go see when they're trying to master a
[2:13:05] horse sometime

[2:17:49] hallelujah
[2:17:51] watch this
[2:17:54] in genesis 17.
[2:17:57] let me give you a background you need to
[2:17:59] stay awake
[2:18:02] in genesis 16
[2:18:06] 15
[2:18:07] god called abraham and god was talking
[2:18:11] to abraham and god spoke to abraham
[2:18:14] abraham said god you gave me everything
[2:18:17] but i'm lacking
[2:18:18] in air
[2:18:19] are you going to take this heavy essay
[2:18:21] of damascus
[2:18:22] to be the one that's going to be there
[2:18:25] god look god said no
[2:18:27] not eliezer of damascus he said abraham
[2:18:30] come assad
[2:18:32] abraham came outside he said look at the
[2:18:34] star you remember we went to that
[2:18:36] when abraham looked at the star he said
[2:18:38] you see her the star
[2:18:40] that's how your seed will be
[2:18:43] so the promise of the seed of abraham
[2:18:46] was given in genesis 16
[2:18:49] 15. anybody follow me i'm saving time
[2:18:52] you can go review this at home
[2:18:55] in genesis 16
[2:18:58] something happened
[2:19:00] the promise was taking longer
[2:19:04] sarah came
[2:19:06] the voice of sarah
[2:19:08] and say abraham
[2:19:10] this is taking too long
[2:19:12] i i don't know your interpretation but
[2:19:15] to me
[2:19:16] i don't know why you keep wasting your
[2:19:18] time
[2:19:19] don't you see something around you
[2:19:21] abraham say what i'm looking at my
[2:19:23] property
[2:19:24] he said i'm talking i'm talking about
[2:19:26] women
[2:19:28] open your eyes shine your eyes
[2:19:30] abraham say what
[2:19:33] he said you never noticed this young
[2:19:35] lady going around here abraham said yes
[2:19:37] she's your servant so what's wrong
[2:19:40] say she can have a baby
[2:19:42] maybe what god wanted to say you can
[2:19:44] have a baby from her
[2:19:47] and the bible said abraham listened to
[2:19:50] the voice of sarah
[2:19:52] and went to edgar and produced ishmael
[2:19:56] after god gave him the promise in
[2:19:59] genesis 15. everybody clear
[2:20:04] each my old bond begin to bring trouble
[2:20:06] to the home
[2:20:07] say i turn around he says
[2:20:10] abraham i can't stand this boy hell and
[2:20:12] her mother must go
[2:20:15] abraham one said no no no that's my own
[2:20:17] blood god said ah uh go ahead and take
[2:20:20] them out
[2:20:22] he took them out
[2:20:24] so abraham looked like he struggled from
[2:20:27] the promise of god in genesis 16.
[2:20:32] everybody clear so far
[2:20:33] now god comes in genesis 17.
[2:20:39] what is god talking to abraham first one
[2:20:42] and when abraham was what
[2:20:44] 90 years older nine
[2:20:48] the lord appeared to abraham and said
[2:20:51] unto him i am water
[2:20:54] abraham i am powerful
[2:20:58] why did god unfold to abraham i said
[2:21:00] almighty

[2:21:31] promise before

[2:22:19] you i am the one who brought the
[2:22:22] separation so that i can bring you to a
[2:22:25] different level

[2:22:49] and god talked with him saying as for me

[2:22:55] shall be what
[2:23:00] are you there

[2:51:43] the spitting on him the taking clothes
[2:51:47] of him

[2:53:30] for taking too long
[2:53:32] [Music]
[2:53:34] but father i'm just
[2:53:37] trying to obey you
[2:53:40] and doing what you want me to do
[2:53:45] lord you have loved this church so much
[2:53:49] you have loved that so
[2:53:50] much we could be continuing through all
[2:53:53] kind of ignorance
[2:53:55] and continuing to make the same mistake
[2:53:59] and being subject
[2:54:01] to spirit
[2:54:02] without understanding
[2:54:05] this walk
[2:54:07] but lord your grace on your mercy is
[2:54:10] coming
[2:54:11] even when we think
[2:54:13] we don't deserve this
[2:54:15] even when we think
[2:54:17] maybe it's so and so against me father
[2:54:20] we don't understand that you're just
[2:54:22] working in our life
[2:54:24] in a mysterious way
[2:54:26] not as a lion
[2:54:28] but as a lamb father
[2:54:31] trying to bring us to that perfection
[2:54:34] where father we're gonna fully manifest
[2:54:37] today like your prophet said the
[2:54:39] millennium will start
[2:54:41] no wonder he could say that the seventh
[2:54:43] seal
[2:54:44] usher even into the millennium
[2:54:47] because what you're trying to do here
[2:54:49] and what you will accomplish because
[2:54:51] it's your word
[2:54:52] will lead us all the way to the
[2:54:54] millennium when we're going to be back
[2:54:56] again to eden to fulfill that one day
[2:55:00] that adam was not able to fulfill
[2:55:03] father you spoke in your word that it's
[2:55:05] not by might
[2:55:07] it is not by power
[2:55:09] but it's by the holy spirit
[2:55:12] father may you give people
[2:55:14] enough humility
[2:55:16] to humble themself
[2:55:18] to understand
[2:55:20] that there is no man in this church
[2:55:23] it is god only
[2:55:26] who's trying
[2:55:27] to do his will
[2:55:29] according to his own plan
[2:55:32] may father we submit ourselves to the
[2:55:34] word
[2:55:35] not only to be only hears of the word
[2:55:39] father but to be doers of this world
[2:55:42] so that when we leave out of this place
[2:55:44] we might be light
[2:55:45] to the people on the outside
[2:55:48] reflecting the very gospel that has been
[2:55:51] preached to us here
[2:55:52] father how can we meet somebody in the
[2:55:55] world
[2:55:56] and behave differently and maybe one day
[2:55:59] they can sneak out on our youtube
[2:56:01] channel and watch what has been preached
[2:56:04] here and wonder how can you be seated
[2:56:07] under a ministry such as this
[2:56:09] and you behaving like this
[2:56:11] how can you be sitting and all knowing
[2:56:14] all these things and continue to do this
[2:56:16] kind of things on whatsapp and facebook
[2:56:19] how can you be under such an anointed
[2:56:22] word of the hour sent by such a mighty
[2:56:25] powerful prophet
[2:56:26] and still living the kind of
[2:56:28] hypocritical life you live in
[2:56:30] father may you bring a conscience like
[2:56:32] you did to the prodigal son that your
[2:56:35] children can come to me to themselves
[2:56:38] and understand that they are children of
[2:56:40] god they are father seeds of abraham and
[2:56:43] you are calling them not to judge them
[2:56:46] but father to show them where they are
[2:56:49] their weakness their position their
[2:56:52] their place where they are now
[2:56:54] in their thermometer their temperature
[2:56:57] their spiritual temperature so that they
[2:56:59] can realize that they need you more than
[2:57:02] anything and further they need to move
[2:57:04] up higher to that high calling that you
[2:57:07] have called us lord father help this
[2:57:10] church lord give us the anointing and
[2:57:12] give us a special grace lord father to
[2:57:15] implement this word lord we commit
