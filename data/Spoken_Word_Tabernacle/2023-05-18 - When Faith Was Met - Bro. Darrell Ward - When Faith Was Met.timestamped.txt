[29:03] testimony
[29:04] um you know last night there was some
[29:05] bad weather came through and we found
[29:08] out just a little while ago we knew
[29:10] there was a lot of damage in Cherryville
[29:12] and I look they said that there is a
[29:14] Taco Bell in there that they thought it
[29:16] was a tornado
[29:18] um and I could hear it it didn't sound
[29:20] like you know they always say it sounds
[29:22] like a hundred trains this didn't sound
[29:24] like that but I looked on the map and
[29:27] we're only three miles from that Taco
[29:29] Bell so we just learned on the on the
[29:31] right here that it was what they call a
[29:33] microburst
[29:35] and uh it flipped cars it tore up a car
[29:38] wash it tore up the um the Taco Bell
[29:41] it's just a burst of air they said two
[29:43] and a half miles usually two and a half
[29:45] miles in diameter we were we're three
[29:48] miles from this thing
[29:50] so it's just a big thing of air that
[29:54] just comes downward and just just boom
[29:55] and it just tore the place up
[29:58] um
[29:59] I think Chris wrote up there to see what
[30:02] see what was going on but there was a
[30:03] lot of traffic because people were I
[30:05] think being nosy and the rescue people
[30:07] they were having to bring people out and
[30:09] rescue them
[30:11] our power went out for a little while
[30:12] and we prayed and prayed and prayed and
[30:14] it finally came on it finally we were
[30:16] blessed in that aspect besides being
[30:18] blessed that we were not affected by
[30:21] this thing I could see it and I could
[30:23] hear it uh it wasn't like a tornado but
[30:26] it was very devastating and the good
[30:28] Lord spared us we've had yeah we're very

[42:23] redemption and I'm like oh my God I
[42:26] thought the Original Seed I'm gonna use
[42:27] the second bullet and here is again the
[42:30] day of redemption amen oh my God how
[42:33] many got clear with the voice of the
[42:36] Archangel and the Trump
[42:38] everything clear the whole church clear
[42:41] nobody was lost somewhere okay because
[42:44] people come up and say okay when Jesus
[42:46] is descending he's doing all three in
[42:49] one shot
[42:50] if you put it like that whatever
[42:52] happened on Sunset Mountain should have
[42:54] raised the dead and change everybody and
[42:57] most of you were not even born
[43:00] so how can the Rapture happen in 1963
[43:03] and you still around here
[43:05] then we're going to come up with a
[43:06] doctrine of millennium you in a
[43:09] millennium getting married
[43:11] you don't understand what you're doing
[43:13] amen
[43:14] amen that's not the case so I have to
[43:17] just open those Gap and show you that
[43:19] God may speak something one time but the
[43:22] way it's fulfilled because the way he
[43:24] interpret the word that is the way the
[43:27] way he fulfilled his word that is his
[43:29] own interpretation amen so don't push
[43:32] the interpretation just go he say Elijah
[43:35] Elijah you're going to do this but when
[43:37] he comes up Elijah only did one the
[43:39] remaining was done
[43:41] and there is the shot there is the voice
[43:43] of the Archangel there is the trumpet of
[43:45] God brother Branham only did one he
[43:48] delivered the shout and that was it but
[43:50] when it comes to the voice of the
[43:52] Archangel and the trumpet of God that
[43:55] will bring the resurrection of the Dead
[43:56] Brother Branham is waiting on us
[43:59] to fulfill that part that is the
[44:02] ministry of Elijah the two remain to
[44:04] Elijah Elisha and the first one remained
[44:08] to Elijah so the first one remained to
[44:10] brother Branham to blow the trumpet but
[44:12] the remaining of the ministry he needs
[44:14] to go sit down while the bride is
[44:16] preparing so you pray for me because
[44:19] they pulled the Original Seed and we
[44:21] need to go back to the seed and see how
[44:23] we are having our body changes but there
[44:26] is a power with that seed remember that
[44:29] seed is another you that is forming
[44:31] amen now we need to understand how to
[44:34] distinguish you and you
[44:36] there is to use
[44:38] amen amen if you know how to work with
[44:42] that guy you will see how powerful you
[44:44] can be
[44:45] because we usually say you can create
[44:46] word who create word
[44:49] who does it is it you or you
[44:54] amen is he you or is it you
[44:57] you need to know who who can make world
[44:59] to come up
[45:01] if you don't know that's why you speak
[45:02] and nothing happened
[45:04] because who's speaking is he you or you
[45:08] now you need to know how is you or when
[45:11] is he you or when is you
[45:15] only
[45:17] that I lost someone
[45:21] so you pray for me if I'm gonna start
[45:24] there or I need to pull the shout
[45:26] because Matthew 25 have a layer that is
[45:29] connected right there but I don't know
[45:32] the song leader got me
[45:35] move forward so let's see maybe the
[45:37] preaching of the word will tell me which
[45:39] direction to go with amen glory to God

[46:59] [Music]
[47:09] oh
[47:11] they believe
[47:15] [Music]
[47:24] all things possible
[47:32] make yourself more my brothers
[47:36] Lord I believe
[47:40] Lord
[47:42] I believe
[47:48] [Music]
[47:55] all these
[47:57] are possible
[48:02] [Music]
[48:10] Lord
[48:12] I believe
[48:18] Lord

[48:25] all things are possible
[48:32] [Music]
[48:33] Lord I believe
[48:40] amen praise the Lord
[48:43] you know that's the only thing he ever
[48:46] asked us to do
[48:49] was to believe
[48:51] if those can believe
[48:54] all things are possible
[48:57] you know the Bible says with man it
[48:59] shall not be possible but then it says
[49:02] with man it can be possible
[49:05] what's the difference
[49:07] because one man believes
[49:11] that thoughts can't believe all things
[49:13] are possible with God and all things are
[49:15] possible with you is that is that the
[49:17] scripture amen amen if you have your
[49:21] Bibles this evening the service of the
[49:22] book of Acts when we read from Acts
[49:24] chapter 28 starting at verse one we're
[49:26] greach in the name of the Lord Jesus and
[49:28] counted an honor to be with you once
[49:30] again we always enjoy coming this way
[49:32] certainly enjoyed the song service and
[49:34] as our brother said there sure is a lot
[49:37] of talent here among God's people amen
[49:41] and praise the Lord I'm so glad you know
[49:43] we're living in a time that the the
[49:45] world has absolutely lost its mind
[49:51] they've just lost their mind
[49:53] and the prophet told us it would be that
[49:56] way and it's that way
[49:58] amen we're not just reading the quotes
[50:01] anymore we're living them
[50:03] [Applause]
[50:04] yeah amen and I'm so glad that I'm with
[50:08] a group of people tonight who has also
[50:10] lost our minds
[50:11] [Applause]
[50:15] because we've got the mind of Christ
[50:20] we know what he wants done with his word
[50:22] amen praise the Lord so what a privilege
[50:25] it is tonight to have the mind of Christ
[50:29] amen so may the Lord richly bless you
[50:31] just believe tonight whatever you have
[50:33] need of that he's certainly able to meet
[50:35] it in this service you know a crowd this
[50:37] size we know there's needs but there's
[50:40] not a need here greater than our Lord
[50:41] amen so we just Look to Him Acts chapter
[50:44] 28 starting at verse 1 we certainly
[50:47] appreciate brother Stephen allowing us
[50:49] to come and may the Lord bless you be
[50:51] our prayer
[50:52] the Bible says this
[50:54] and when they were escaped then they
[50:56] knew that the island was called Melita
[50:58] and the barbarious people showed us no
[51:00] little kindness for the Kindle the fire
[51:02] and received us every one because of the
[51:05] present Reign and because of the cold
[51:08] and when Paul had gathered a bundle of
[51:10] sticks and laid them on the fire there
[51:11] came a viper out of the Heat and
[51:13] fastened on his hand
[51:16] and when The Barbarians saw that the
[51:18] venomous beasts hang on his hand they
[51:19] said among themselves no doubt this man
[51:23] is a murderer
[51:25] whom though he hath escaped the sea yet
[51:28] Vengeance suffereth not to live
[51:31] and it's something that people always
[51:33] think the worst
[51:35] amen
[51:37] but Paul he shook off the Beast Into the
[51:40] Fire and felt no harm and how Beth they
[51:45] looked when he should have swollen or
[51:46] fallen down dead suddenly but after they
[51:49] had looked a great while and saw no harm
[51:51] come to him they changed their minds and
[51:56] said that he was a god
[52:01] how fast their opinion of Paul changed
[52:04] from being a murderer to a god
[52:07] which snaked in him met faith
[52:11] [Music]
[52:12] [Applause]
[52:15] and that's what we want to speak on this
[52:16] evening
[52:17] When Faith was met Amen Let Us bow our
[52:21] heads
[52:22] Heavenly Father Lord we counted such a
[52:26] privilege to gather here with your
[52:27] children this evening
[52:29] father I pray that you'd come and take
[52:32] these thoughts dear God and Quicken it
[52:33] to the hearts of your children that we
[52:36] can rise up and receive that Lord which
[52:38] you've already done for us
[52:40] father God I pray that tonight that your
[52:43] spirit would just move among your
[52:45] children and those that dear God that
[52:47] would maybe be weak or tired Lord or
[52:50] maybe depressed or maybe sick or
[52:52] whatever the need would be Lord may they
[52:55] look to you tonight father we pray and
[52:57] Lord you see this need of sister Erica
[53:00] Lord as once again we bring her name
[53:02] before you father God may you just touch
[53:05] our sister Lord
[53:06] knowing dear God that you're the Healer
[53:09] and the sustainer of Our Lives Lord we
[53:13] commit this congregation and ourselves
[53:15] into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus
[53:17] name and the bride says
[53:20] God bless you Saints you may be seated
[53:23] now brother Branham told us that perfect
[53:26] Faith Masters all circumstances
[53:30] perfect Faith Masters all circumstances
[53:33] no matter what it is it Masters it he
[53:38] says now just watch when you believe
[53:40] anything or do anything you've got to
[53:43] have faith in what you're doing and
[53:46] Faith Masters that circumstance
[53:49] when you believe anything or do anything
[53:52] you've got to have faith in what you're
[53:54] doing then when we come through these
[53:56] doors here to have church we need to
[53:58] come with the understanding that we
[54:00] didn't come to see what's happening we
[54:02] come because we are what's happening we
[54:05] need to come with the understanding that
[54:07] I'm not here by accident that God put me
[54:10] here he could have put me in Luther's
[54:12] day or Wesley's day or the restoration
[54:14] of the gifts but God in his great wisdom
[54:16] chose this day this time this season
[54:19] amen this ain't Luther's day he's had
[54:22] his day this ain't Wesley's day they've
[54:24] had their day but this is the bride time
[54:26] Bride season bride light the
[54:28] manifestation of the Sons and Daughters
[54:30] of God come on somebody this is the hour
[54:33] Hallelujah when the prophet of God said
[54:35] that the bride is bone and flesh of
[54:38] Jesus Christ amen this is the hour this
[54:41] is who we are we're not going to be but
[54:43] we are now Sons and Daughters of God the
[54:46] prophet said I didn't come to mix up a
[54:48] Doctrine but I come to straighten one
[54:49] out to get away from this fear and the
[54:52] scare that you don't know who you are he
[54:54] said you're not going to be but you are
[54:56] now Sons and Daughters of God you always
[54:59] were Sons and Daughters of God and we
[55:02] need to come through those doors by
[55:03] faith believing that God put us here to
[55:06] tear Satan's kingdom down
[55:10] hallelujah we're not here to lose we're
[55:13] not here to actually survive but we are
[55:15] here for a rapture
[55:18] yes sir I said we are here for a Rapture
[55:21] amen
[55:22] and Faith Masters that circumstance you
[55:25] see faith is not a Hocus Pocus
[55:28] it's not a magic wand that you wave over
[55:31] somebody
[55:32] faith is not what you feel
[55:34] it's what you believe
[55:36] and faith has to have a resting place
[55:40] and the word of God is the foundation
[55:42] that Faith rests upon the Bible says the
[55:46] Romans 3 4 let God be true and every man
[55:49] a liar the Bible said Heaven's the nurse
[55:52] shall pass away but not one word of God
[55:55] will fail then we can sit here this
[55:57] evening with this confidence that God's
[56:00] word does not lie
[56:03] [Applause]
[56:05] God will do what he said he will do amen
[56:08] Nations will lie to us governments will
[56:12] lie to us politicians
[56:17] they'll lie to us and sometimes even
[56:20] people who are close to us will lie to
[56:23] us
[56:25] our feelings will lie to us our emotions
[56:28] will lie to us Sensations will lie to us
[56:32] but the word of God will never lie to us
[56:37] and every word of God is just as true as
[56:41] every word of God it's either all true
[56:43] or none of it's true
[56:48] God said let there be light is there
[56:50] light
[56:51] did God keep his word that same God said
[56:54] behold I send you Elijah did he do it
[56:57] did he keep his word that same God said
[57:00] I am the Lord thy God who heals all thy
[57:03] diseases
[57:06] Hallelujah he is the Healer amen
[57:09] or you say I go to the doctor you break
[57:12] your arm the doctor can said it but who
[57:14] does the healing
[57:16] oh healing comes from God
[57:19] now how does God prove his word god
[57:22] proves his word by bringing it to pass
[57:27] hey the father said oh hell I love him
[57:30] God always keeps his word he will keep
[57:34] his word every time
[57:36] [Applause]
[57:38] not 99 times out of 100.
[57:41] think about that 99 times I bet Vegas
[57:44] would like to have those odds
[57:47] that every time you pull that handle 99
[57:49] times out of 100 you're going to win
[57:52] that might be something for Vegas but it
[57:54] ain't good enough for God
[57:56] for the prophet said not 99.
[58:00] not 99 times out of 100 but 100 times
[58:04] out of a hundred God will keep his word
[58:08] and Faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[58:11] by the word of God when you hear what
[58:14] the word is saying to you
[58:17] [Applause]
[58:19] [Music]
[58:21] [Applause]
[58:25] what the word is saying to you
[58:29] you see it's got to be a personal
[58:31] revelation
[58:33] what is the new birth brother Venom it's
[58:35] Christ revealed to you personally
[58:39] you have met this person
[58:44] amen you say I believe the message the
[58:46] devil believes the message
[58:49] you've got to have the experience not
[58:51] enough to prophesake just to talk about
[58:53] the token but the hour has come that we
[58:56] must apply the token
[58:59] Hallelujah
[59:01] Hallelujah
[59:02] do you love him
[59:04] [Applause]
[59:06] when you hear what the word is saying to
[59:09] you when the word becomes to like the
[59:12] little boy the prophet talked about had
[59:14] never saw a mirror
[59:16] and he went there to his grandma's house
[59:18] or this aunt's house or wherever and
[59:21] there was the mirror and when he first
[59:22] saw it he thought he had to play me
[59:25] he waved and the boy waved back he
[59:28] smiled and the boy smiled back and he
[59:30] got closer and closer and closer and
[59:32] finally he touched the mirror and the
[59:34] Revelation struck him
[59:37] he said well Mama it's me and we need to
[59:40] look into the mirror of the word and get
[59:43] closer and closer and closer and closer
[59:46] till you come to the understanding it's
[59:48] me the word is speaking of me amen
[59:53] Hallelujah
[59:56] Hallelujah that moment that Mary
[59:58] realized that Isaiah was prophesying a
[1:00:02] virgin shall conceive that moment that
[1:00:04] the Revelation struck her I am the
[1:00:07] prophecy of Isaiah made flesh and let me
[1:00:09] say this bride hallelujah it's the
[1:00:12] manifestation of the prophets prophecy
[1:00:14] concerning the bride
[1:00:16] [Applause]
[1:00:19] well you think there'll be a bride I'm
[1:00:21] looking at her
[1:00:23] Hallelujah
[1:00:25] Hallelujah
[1:00:27] [Music]
[1:00:32] then no matter what the circumstance is
[1:00:35] that's not what that don't have one
[1:00:37] thing to do with it
[1:00:38] well the doctor says it's bad the
[1:00:40] situation is impossible circumstances
[1:00:43] has nothing to do with it
[1:00:46] [Applause]
[1:00:47] Faith Masters that circumstance
[1:00:51] Faith beliefs that God will work it out
[1:00:55] I don't know how he's going to do it but
[1:00:58] you see I don't have to know how he's
[1:01:00] going to do it
[1:01:01] many times she don't ask us to
[1:01:03] understand he just asked us can you
[1:01:06] trust me
[1:01:08] the Bible said that all things weren't
[1:01:10] too good then no matter what you're
[1:01:12] facing right now no matter what you're
[1:01:14] dealing with right now it's for your
[1:01:16] good
[1:01:17] how do you know that the word said so
[1:01:20] and God's word does not lie
[1:01:25] I think no matter what we're dealing
[1:01:27] with in our life it's bringing us to
[1:01:29] that place oh God it's bringing us to
[1:01:31] that image that God had of us in his
[1:01:33] mind before there was a woman
[1:01:35] [Applause]
[1:01:37] amen
[1:01:39] see Faith Masters you see
[1:01:41] Faith Masters all circumstance
[1:01:44] and faith and love is a relation
[1:01:48] because you can't have faith unless
[1:01:50] you've got love
[1:01:53] because your faith is in a God Who is
[1:01:55] the very essence of love and faith and
[1:01:59] love works together
[1:02:01] you see if he loved me enough to die for
[1:02:03] me
[1:02:04] then he loves me enough to heal me he
[1:02:06] loves him enough to save me he loves me
[1:02:08] love to deliver me to forgive me to
[1:02:10] Rapture me and you have faith in The God
[1:02:12] Who Loves You Hallelujah do you have
[1:02:15] faith in the God who loves you and in
[1:02:17] faith in what the word is saying about
[1:02:19] you
[1:02:20] [Applause]
[1:02:22] [Music]
[1:02:23] you've got to read the Bible like a love
[1:02:26] story
[1:02:26] [Applause]
[1:02:33] Faith Masters every circumstance
[1:02:37] because it's not what you feel it's not
[1:02:40] what you see it's not what you
[1:02:42] understand or what you reason out it's
[1:02:45] what you believe
[1:02:47] [Applause]
[1:02:49] when you hear what the word is saying
[1:02:52] about you then that word takes
[1:02:54] preeminence
[1:02:56] the word takes preeminence over every
[1:02:59] circumstance
[1:03:02] when you see yourself
[1:03:05] in the scriptures
[1:03:07] [Applause]
[1:03:10] like Paul
[1:03:11] in Acts 23 10 when thy Rose the great
[1:03:14] dissension and the chief Captain
[1:03:15] Fearless Paul should be pulled into
[1:03:17] pieces of them commanded the soldiers to
[1:03:19] go down and get him and take him by
[1:03:21] force from among them and bring him into
[1:03:23] the castle and the night following the
[1:03:26] Lord stood by him
[1:03:28] had said be of good cheer
[1:03:30] Paul for as thou has testified of me in
[1:03:33] Jerusalem so must thou be witness of me
[1:03:36] and Rome
[1:03:40] so where is Paul headed he's headed to
[1:03:43] Rome
[1:03:44] why God said so
[1:03:47] how's it going to get there
[1:03:50] circumstances does not matter
[1:03:53] he'll get there because the word said
[1:03:56] he'll get there well how do we go to the
[1:03:58] Rapture brother Daryl it's looking so
[1:04:00] bad it's looking so dark will Rapture
[1:04:02] Hallelujah because the word sadly will
[1:04:06] circumstances has nothing to do with it
[1:04:12] Hallelujah
[1:04:16] we'll get there because God said so
[1:04:20] and on his way there arose a great storm
[1:04:23] and 14 days and nights no man ate
[1:04:27] anything
[1:04:29] now this must have been some kind of a
[1:04:31] storm
[1:04:31] because you know how we like to eat
[1:04:37] 14 days and nights
[1:04:40] but after a long absences Paul stood
[1:04:43] forth in the midst of them and said sirs
[1:04:45] you should have hearkened unto me and
[1:04:47] not have loose from clay to have gained
[1:04:49] this harm and lost and now I exhort you
[1:04:52] to be of good cheer
[1:04:54] for there shall be no loss of any man's
[1:04:56] life among you but of the ship for there
[1:04:58] stood by me this night this angel of God
[1:05:01] whose I am and whom I serve
[1:05:04] saying fear not Paul thou must be
[1:05:06] brought before Caesar and lo God hath
[1:05:09] given thee all them that sell with thee
[1:05:13] so what did the angel do the angel
[1:05:15] didn't come and bring him a new word he
[1:05:17] just come and reminded him of what God
[1:05:19] already said
[1:05:20] [Applause]
[1:05:22] foreign
[1:05:25] Hallelujah the angel messenger that came
[1:05:28] to us didn't come to bring us something
[1:05:30] new but to restore us back to the
[1:05:32] original word amen
[1:05:36] Hallelujah not a new doctrine but to
[1:05:39] take the Loose Ends and bring it all
[1:05:41] back together that you could see the
[1:05:43] picture and what does the word make it
[1:05:46] makes Christ
[1:05:49] Hallelujah
[1:05:51] [Music]
[1:05:53] [Applause]
[1:05:56] Hallelujah fear not Paul
[1:06:00] you're not gonna die
[1:06:02] why God's word said you must go to Rome
[1:06:04] you're going to be a witness of me at
[1:06:06] Rome
[1:06:07] Paul said we're forcers be of good cheer
[1:06:12] for I believe God

[1:06:19] then be happy
[1:06:22] what are you worried about
[1:06:29] poop they gonna do one thing but what
[1:06:32] God allows him to do
[1:06:34] well he's threatened a nuclear war but
[1:06:36] the prophet of God said if they push
[1:06:38] that button before one bomb hits this
[1:06:40] nation we will be gone
[1:06:43] what are you worried about be of good
[1:06:46] cheer
[1:06:47] for I believe God
[1:06:49] [Applause]
[1:06:55] and the ship finally broke up from the
[1:06:57] storm just like they said
[1:06:59] and taking pieces of the ship Paul and
[1:07:01] the others went to shore
[1:07:04] now Paul didn't say now look boys I'm
[1:07:06] the church age messenger I'm the man of
[1:07:08] the hour I'm a prophet of God so I'm
[1:07:11] going to lay back here now you all go
[1:07:12] out there and get that wood be careful
[1:07:15] no
[1:07:16] you see Paul had a correct revelation
[1:07:20] he was a servant to the people
[1:07:23] and let me say the ministry Hallelujah
[1:07:25] the bride
[1:07:27] is not a servant to the ministry but the
[1:07:30] ministry is the servant to the bride
[1:07:33] the gift that's in a man's life is not
[1:07:36] for himself it's for you
[1:07:39] and if God is placed the gifted behind
[1:07:42] her at this pulpit in our brother you
[1:07:45] should respect it and honor it because
[1:07:47] God placed it here
[1:07:49] he placed it come on somebody he placed
[1:07:52] it here to bring us to perfection
[1:07:57] God chose man to preach the gospel he
[1:08:00] never chose the Stars he never chose the
[1:08:02] moon he never chose tape players
[1:08:05] [Applause]
[1:08:06] [Music]
[1:08:11] he chose man
[1:08:12] [Applause]
[1:08:15] how do you know that brother Daryl the
[1:08:17] prophet said so
[1:08:18] [Applause]
[1:08:21] Paul goes out gathers up some wood
[1:08:25] to so they could get warm and when he
[1:08:27] goes up together some kindling and as he
[1:08:30] goes to put the fire the wood into the
[1:08:32] fire a snake struck him right on the
[1:08:34] hand
[1:08:35] now this snake was so deadly that they
[1:08:38] just sat down to watch him die
[1:08:42] they never even offered a Band-Aid
[1:08:45] there ain't no need to get no first aid
[1:08:47] kit you'll be dead before you get it
[1:08:49] open
[1:08:52] this snake was so deadly
[1:08:55] that they sat down to watch him die
[1:08:58] and they said this man must have done
[1:09:00] some kind of evil
[1:09:03] to escape the storm and now be struck by
[1:09:06] this snake
[1:09:07] you see the Venom of the snake it
[1:09:09] attacks the nervous system
[1:09:12] and though it would it's they start to
[1:09:14] lose the the inability to breathe and
[1:09:17] then they start swelling up it shuts
[1:09:19] down the nervous system and then it
[1:09:21] shuts down the breathing and then they
[1:09:23] swell up
[1:09:24] they no need to call 9-1-1 you'd be dead
[1:09:27] before you got the one dog
[1:09:29] so they just sat down to watch it
[1:09:36] sat down to watch him die
[1:09:42] he must have done some kind of evil
[1:09:46] and the Venom did it body it absolutely
[1:09:49] bitty
[1:09:51] and the Venom started up his arm
[1:09:54] just like it done to every person that
[1:09:56] it bit
[1:09:57] the Venom was doing what it was designed
[1:09:59] to do but all at once the Venom met
[1:10:03] faith
[1:10:05] and with the Venom met faith
[1:10:08] faith in the word that says you've got
[1:10:10] to go to Rome you've got to appear
[1:10:12] before Caesar
[1:10:14] and when Paul took God's word over the
[1:10:17] Venom
[1:10:20] God took the poison out of the Venom
[1:10:26] and when the Venom met Faith there was
[1:10:29] no more poison
[1:10:32] ball took the word of God over the fear
[1:10:35] of a deadly snake bite
[1:10:39] [Music]
[1:10:40] the word of God cast out fear
[1:10:46] he just pitched it over into the fire
[1:10:49] and gathered more wood and the people of
[1:10:52] the island said
[1:10:53] this man ain't a murderer
[1:10:56] he's a god
[1:11:00] you see it wasn't Paul saying I'm a God
[1:11:04] it was them saying it
[1:11:06] [Applause]
[1:11:10] so you mean to tell me when a Son of God
[1:11:12] by faith takes the word of God into his
[1:11:16] heart and speaks it back upon his lips
[1:11:18] it's just the same as dearly speaking
[1:11:23] deity God in flesh
[1:11:27] you see God just didn't want to be above
[1:11:30] us nor did God just want to be with us
[1:11:32] but God's ultimate desire was to be in
[1:11:35] US
[1:11:36] it's no longer Christ in a major it's
[1:11:38] Christ in you
[1:11:40] [Applause]
[1:11:46] they said this man's a god
[1:11:51] so when a man believes the word of God
[1:11:53] the spoken concerning him and manifests
[1:11:56] that word
[1:11:57] it's just the same as deity
[1:12:02] did not Jesus say if you can if you
[1:12:05] can't believe me believe the works that
[1:12:07] I do
[1:12:09] for they tell you who I am
[1:12:10] [Applause]
[1:12:13] the three Hebrew children stay true to
[1:12:15] God's word and would not bow their knee
[1:12:17] to the king's commandment so what did he
[1:12:20] do he heated up the furnace seven times
[1:12:23] hotter than it ever been heated
[1:12:26] so hot that it killed the men who threw
[1:12:30] them in it
[1:12:33] think of the insanity they burned their
[1:12:37] own men trying to kill Shadrach Meshach
[1:12:39] and Abednego
[1:12:41] and let me say tonight the devil will
[1:12:44] destroy his own kingdom trying to stop
[1:12:46] this bride but he will never stop this
[1:12:50] bride
[1:12:51] [Applause]
[1:12:53] she is unmovable she is Unstoppable she
[1:12:57] is undefeatable come on somebody
[1:12:59] [Applause]
[1:13:07] those three Hebrew Boys in that fire
[1:13:09] they testified our God is able to
[1:13:12] Deliver Us from this furry furnace
[1:13:18] they were the Seed of Abraham and they
[1:13:21] had a promise of God that his seed would
[1:13:24] possess the enemy's Gates
[1:13:25] [Applause]
[1:13:27] and when the king's fiery furnace meant
[1:13:30] faith in what God told their father
[1:13:32] Abraham
[1:13:36] well let me say that again when the
[1:13:38] Kings fiery furnace that faith Faith
[1:13:42] took the Heat and the smoke out of the
[1:13:45] fire
[1:13:51] you see the fire was still there
[1:13:57] I said the fire was still there because
[1:13:59] see if the king had looked in and saw no
[1:14:02] fire he'd have just lit it again
[1:14:06] but when he saw the fire and they wasn't
[1:14:08] burning
[1:14:10] he couldn't understand it but they
[1:14:12] understood it
[1:14:14] that faith in God's word can take the
[1:14:17] Heat and the smoke out of the fire
[1:14:19] [Music]
[1:14:20] [Applause]
[1:14:23] [Music]
[1:14:25] [Applause]
[1:14:27] oh Hallelujah
[1:14:29] oh Hallelujah
[1:14:32] I want to be where the waters cannot
[1:14:36] overturn me in the presence of God
[1:14:41] [Applause]
[1:14:43] I want to be where the Blazing Flames
[1:14:47] cannot burn me
[1:14:49] in your presence oh God hallelujah
[1:14:54] in his presence amen
[1:14:57] Hallelujah
[1:15:02] what about Daniel thrown in the Lion's
[1:15:04] Den and the Lions knew they had an easy
[1:15:06] meal
[1:15:07] ain't nowhere for the man to go
[1:15:12] no doubt they thought this is a Happy
[1:15:14] Meal
[1:15:17] you see no doubt they had eight humans
[1:15:19] before and they had an appetite for
[1:15:21] human flesh
[1:15:25] and when they saw him
[1:15:27] with nowhere to go
[1:15:29] they said yum yum here we come
[1:15:34] but when the Lions
[1:15:36] met faith
[1:15:38] [Applause]
[1:15:40] Faith locked their jaws amen
[1:15:44] when the pillar of fire stood between
[1:15:45] Daniel and those Lions the Lions went
[1:15:48] off into the corner and meowed like
[1:15:50] kittens
[1:15:55] [Applause]
[1:15:56] they went from the Roar of the line to
[1:15:59] meow
[1:16:00] meow
[1:16:02] that's not the bible say that Satan is
[1:16:05] as a roaring lion
[1:16:08] but we've got the Revelation he's just a
[1:16:11] kitten
[1:16:15] Hallelujah
[1:16:16] [Applause]
[1:16:24] Hallelujah
[1:16:26] and when faith
[1:16:28] when the Lions meant faith it locked
[1:16:31] their jaws when the woman with the blood
[1:16:33] issue 12 years of bleeding
[1:16:36] and it would not stop
[1:16:40] when she went into the town she had to
[1:16:42] yell unclean unclean
[1:16:45] humiliated embarrassed
[1:16:48] spent over money
[1:16:50] and after she spent all her money the
[1:16:52] doctor said we can't help you
[1:16:55] wouldn't have been nice if they told her
[1:16:56] that the first visit
[1:17:02] instead of taking her money and then
[1:17:04] confess it
[1:17:07] come on somebody
[1:17:09] brother you believe in doctors yeah I
[1:17:11] believe in doctors but when they say
[1:17:13] they can't help us I know somebody who
[1:17:15] can
[1:17:16] [Applause]
[1:17:16] [Music]
[1:17:18] [Applause]
[1:17:23] when my daughter was hurt in the
[1:17:24] accident two of my family was killed and
[1:17:26] the doctor said they couldn't help her I
[1:17:28] said I know somebody who can
[1:17:31] oh Hallelujah
[1:17:35] she spent all of her money but she saw
[1:17:38] Jesus and pressing through as her sister
[1:17:40] sang about and pressing through the
[1:17:42] cloud
[1:17:45] she believed that Jesus was the Christ
[1:17:47] and she said if I can only touch the
[1:17:50] hill of His Garment
[1:17:52] she believed if she touched him she'd
[1:17:54] get what she asked for
[1:17:56] and she slipped through the crowd
[1:17:58] [Applause]
[1:18:00] she must have been smaller stature
[1:18:02] because notice she never touched him on
[1:18:04] the shoulder she never touched him on
[1:18:06] the arm
[1:18:07] [Music]
[1:18:08] so no doubt she could even reach over
[1:18:10] the crowd to touch him so she had to
[1:18:12] Humble herself down that's what we need
[1:18:14] to do we need to Humble ourselves down
[1:18:17] sometimes we just need to admit I need
[1:18:19] help
[1:18:20] [Applause]
[1:18:22] come on somebody sometimes you just got
[1:18:24] to be honest and say God I need you
[1:18:29] she was willing to Humble herself down
[1:18:32] and maybe reach through their legs just
[1:18:34] to Touch the Hem of His garnish
[1:18:40] and when she touched him Jesus Stood
[1:18:42] Still
[1:18:43] [Applause]
[1:18:50] she believed if she touched him she'd
[1:18:52] get what she asked for
[1:18:54] believing that what she said would
[1:18:56] happen
[1:18:57] notice Jesus never said if you touch me
[1:19:00] you'll get well
[1:19:02] Jesus never said it
[1:19:04] Peter Peter never said listen come here
[1:19:07] I see you've got a need but I've been
[1:19:10] walking with the master and I know how
[1:19:12] to get his attention
[1:19:14] Peter never said it Jesus never said it
[1:19:17] who said If I Could Touch His Garment
[1:19:20] not Jesus not Peter her
[1:19:24] [Applause]
[1:19:28] her faith that he was the Christ brought
[1:19:31] her own words into manifestation
[1:19:35] and her words her words became the very
[1:19:39] word of God we read
[1:19:42] Hallelujah
[1:19:44] Hallelujah Faith Hallelujah faith in
[1:19:48] them said Christ being the Son of God it
[1:19:51] brought her words into manifestation
[1:19:53] [Applause]
[1:19:56] and with a blood issue that eluded the
[1:19:58] doctors for 12 years meant Faith the
[1:20:01] bleeding stopped why Faith Masters every
[1:20:04] circumstance
[1:20:06] [Music]
[1:20:09] I think of Joshua
[1:20:12] God told Joshua I want you to March
[1:20:15] around the walls of Jericho and they'll
[1:20:17] fall before you
[1:20:18] now the walls of Jericho they say some
[1:20:21] say that they were 46 foot high and 80
[1:20:25] foot wide that you can race chariots
[1:20:27] around the top of it and if you Bible
[1:20:29] readers know rahab's house was setting
[1:20:32] on top the wall
[1:20:35] so that's how big these walls were 46
[1:20:38] foot high 80 foot thick and God said now
[1:20:41] Joshua I want you to go up there March
[1:20:44] around it so many times sound a trumpet
[1:20:46] and you all let out a shout and the wall
[1:20:49] is going to fall down
[1:20:52] [Music]
[1:21:00] you want us
[1:21:02] to March around the walls
[1:21:04] blow a trumpet
[1:21:06] let us Shout
[1:21:08] and the walls are going to fall down
[1:21:13] [Music]
[1:21:21] do we need a record bar
[1:21:24] nope backhoe
[1:21:26] bulldozer case of dynamite
[1:21:30] what do I need just obedience to my word
[1:21:35] March blow a trumpet Shout
[1:21:40] that is so silly to the carnal mind
[1:21:44] [Applause]
[1:21:46] you see Joshua knew how thick those
[1:21:48] walls was because he built plenty of
[1:21:50] them in Egypt
[1:21:52] he knew what went in them he knew how
[1:21:54] tight they were he knew how thick they
[1:21:56] were so Joshua had to lean not to his
[1:21:58] own understanding
[1:22:00] not to his medical knowledge
[1:22:03] no sir he could not lead to that or
[1:22:06] Hallelujah he had to lead to God's word
[1:22:09] [Applause]
[1:22:16] he did not lead to his own understanding
[1:22:18] he believed that what God Said was the
[1:22:20] truth and he obeyed his word
[1:22:23] and the walls fell down
[1:22:26] Lena not to his own understanding Joshua
[1:22:29] looked at the Unseen he walked around
[1:22:31] the walls believing it would happen
[1:22:33] you see it all depends on what you're
[1:22:36] looking at
[1:22:39] you see if you get the correct
[1:22:41] Revelation you can shout the victory
[1:22:44] before you ever have it
[1:22:46] [Applause]
[1:22:50] [Music]
[1:22:53] you know you take a football team
[1:22:57] when it's Fourth and 40.
[1:23:00] fourth down 40 yards for a touchdown
[1:23:03] ain't too many of them shouting
[1:23:05] because they don't know if they're going
[1:23:06] to make it or not but when they throw
[1:23:08] that Hail Mary and the guy tipped it
[1:23:10] tipped it and pulls it in the place Goes
[1:23:13] Wild
[1:23:14] because they scored a touchdown
[1:23:18] but you see we're different
[1:23:20] we could shout the victory before we
[1:23:22] ever score
[1:23:34] see
[1:23:35] when I was in the army
[1:23:37] they gave me a steel pot
[1:23:39] they gave me an M16 rifle with a banana
[1:23:42] Cliff that held 18 rounds they gave me
[1:23:44] them 203 you may know what a 203 is
[1:23:46] there you thinking m-203 was a grenade
[1:23:49] launcher and they gave it to me because
[1:23:51] I was on the firing range shooting the
[1:23:53] rifle and I took one shot and he said
[1:23:55] you'll be the grenade carrier
[1:23:57] because you don't have to be accurate
[1:23:59] just close
[1:24:06] so I carried it the whole time I was in
[1:24:08] the Army and M16 with the m203 and you
[1:24:11] with the the grenade it looked like a
[1:24:13] big shotgun shell and you stick it in it
[1:24:14] put it under your arm and go Boop
[1:24:18] and I carried it they gave me combat
[1:24:20] boots they gave me a helmet they gave me
[1:24:22] we called it a steel pot they gave me an
[1:24:24] M16 an m203 I was on a 155 Hauser that

[1:24:39] 18 miles they gave me all this to defend
[1:24:42] this nation
[1:24:43] they gave me this to fight battles but
[1:24:46] there's one thing they never gave me
[1:24:48] they never gave me the promise of the
[1:24:50] victory
[1:24:51] [Applause]
[1:24:54] but when I got into God's Army he gave
[1:24:58] me
[1:24:59] a helmet of salvation he's shot in the
[1:25:01] feet with the preparation of the Gospel
[1:25:03] he gave me the shield of Faith the sword
[1:25:05] of the word but God gave me the promise
[1:25:07] of the victory he said look at the back
[1:25:10] of the book you win then we can stop the
[1:25:13] victory before we ever have the battle
[1:25:18] Hallelujah
[1:25:20] Hallelujah
[1:25:24] with walls 46 foot high and 80 foot
[1:25:27] thick met Faith the walls came down
[1:25:31] [Applause]
[1:25:41] jairus's daughter lay dead and the
[1:25:43] mourner said trouble not the master
[1:25:45] anymore
[1:25:47] your little girl is dead just a
[1:25:50] there's something about that word that's
[1:25:52] so final
[1:25:54] but always remember we serve a God who
[1:25:56] raises the Dead
[1:25:58] [Applause]
[1:26:02] but that word is so final and when they
[1:26:05] told him trouble not the master your
[1:26:07] little girl is dead you're too late
[1:26:13] but Jesus gave Jairus the remedy to
[1:26:17] every bad report
[1:26:21] when he touched him on the shoulder
[1:26:24] and said only
[1:26:25] believe
[1:26:27] [Applause]
[1:26:33] Jesus standing at the grave of Lazarus a
[1:26:36] man that had been dead four days
[1:26:37] corruption had done set in even his
[1:26:40] sister said Lord he stinks
[1:26:43] but when a dead man met a man who had
[1:26:45] faith in what the word said he was
[1:26:48] death gave way to life when he cried out
[1:26:51] lies with come forth
[1:26:54] the maniac of kadera demons had him
[1:26:57] bound the Bible said he lived among the
[1:26:59] tombs
[1:27:00] cut himself with stones and they tried
[1:27:03] to chain him and they tried to tame him
[1:27:05] they tried to make him a good Baptist or
[1:27:07] a Methodist
[1:27:09] gave him a few quote books in a picture
[1:27:11] [Music]
[1:27:13] and he would do good for a while then
[1:27:15] that would come upon him and he'd tear
[1:27:17] off his clothes and go back among the
[1:27:19] Dead
[1:27:21] the Bible said he broke the chains and
[1:27:24] the feathers and no man could tame him
[1:27:26] but what man couldn't do Faith could
[1:27:34] what brought Jesus to the gallerians it
[1:27:37] wasn't the mayor yeah
[1:27:40] it wasn't an organization that invited
[1:27:43] you it wasn't the pig Farmers they asked
[1:27:46] him to leave
[1:27:48] what brought Jesus to the gallerience it
[1:27:52] was a maniac
[1:27:56] who was living in the tombs cutting his
[1:27:58] flesh ripping off his clothes but he
[1:28:01] wanted help and that needy Soul was
[1:28:03] crying out for deliverance at Jesus on
[1:28:06] the other side of the sea heard his
[1:28:09] invite of faith
[1:28:12] and Jesus crossed the stormy sea to get
[1:28:16] to one
[1:28:17] for the sake of one's soul and he's the
[1:28:20] same one tonight he'll come from glory
[1:28:22] to One sneedy Soul sitting in this
[1:28:26] humble church tonight he's the same
[1:28:28] yesterday today and forever he'll come
[1:28:30] every time where he's wounded he'll come
[1:28:33] every time where he's wounded
[1:28:35] [Applause]
[1:28:40] but he will never come where he's
[1:28:42] doubted
[1:28:43] [Applause]
[1:28:44] [Music]
[1:28:45] he'll come every time where he's wanted
[1:28:48] but he never come comes where he's
[1:28:50] doubted so if you doubting him just
[1:28:52] remember he'll never be
[1:28:55] at your door
[1:28:57] you see that's why some people see Jesus
[1:28:59] every time they come to church
[1:29:01] because their faith declares he's here
[1:29:05] others come and never seen
[1:29:10] because they lean to their own
[1:29:12] understanding to their feelings well I
[1:29:14] don't feel nothing so
[1:29:19] feelings got nothing to do with it
[1:29:22] you can get a goosebump from the air
[1:29:24] conditioner
[1:29:25] come on somebody
[1:29:28] and I'm not against those things but I'm
[1:29:30] just telling you that's
[1:29:31] we don't base it on that
[1:29:36] he never said did you feel it he said
[1:29:38] did you believe it
[1:29:43] you see Jesus heard this Maniacs Cry of
[1:29:46] faith and if you heard his Cry of Faith
[1:29:48] he's no respect of persons he'll hear
[1:29:50] your cry
[1:29:52] and that great storm could not stop
[1:29:55] Jesus from coming it could not drowned
[1:29:58] out that cry of Faith there is no hope
[1:30:00] thank you Lord there is nothing that
[1:30:02] Satan has that can stop Faith from
[1:30:05] touching Jesus
[1:30:09] touching Jesus is all that really
[1:30:13] matters and then your life will never be
[1:30:17] the same there's only one way to touch
[1:30:24] you you must believe when you call on
[1:30:29] his name
[1:30:38] brother Ben said when Faith from an
[1:30:40] honest heart meets God them cogs just
[1:30:44] comes together like that something has
[1:30:46] to take place
[1:30:48] I challenge this audience in the name of
[1:30:51] Jesus Christ let your faith connect with
[1:30:53] God like that and in a few minutes
[1:30:55] you'll have another Pentecost there'll
[1:30:57] be such a Revival breakout in this town
[1:30:59] there won't be enough cops in the
[1:31:01] country to keep them down
[1:31:03] there'll be a real Revival when your
[1:31:06] faith from an honest heart meets God
[1:31:16] and hold on to your false teeth
[1:31:19] this is a good one right here
[1:31:21] the prophet said you don't go to hell
[1:31:23] because you're a sinner
[1:31:28] you don't go to hell because you're a
[1:31:30] sinner
[1:31:31] we was born in sin shape of the iniquity
[1:31:33] we had nothing to do with it
[1:31:36] come on somebody if we'd had a choice
[1:31:38] we'd have never been born that way but
[1:31:40] we didn't have a choice
[1:31:43] Eve got us into this mess
[1:31:45] I believe I will
[1:31:47] [Applause]
[1:31:50] you don't go to hell because you're a
[1:31:52] sinner you go to hell because you refuse
[1:31:55] to accept the way away from hell
[1:31:58] there's a bypass and that's Christ
[1:32:02] there's a bypass from your sickness a
[1:32:04] quick death a premature grave and that's
[1:32:06] through Christ
[1:32:08] you sinned in the beginning but Christ
[1:32:10] died for your sins therefore he saved
[1:32:13] you when he died he saved you and he
[1:32:15] healed you when he died for he took your
[1:32:19] place
[1:32:20] [Applause]
[1:32:25] so he saved me and healed me at the same
[1:32:28] time
[1:32:31] and all you have to do is accept it by
[1:32:34] faith and you'll receive it
[1:32:37] there's nothing more to be done because
[1:32:39] your healing is already paid for
[1:32:41] you can have it right this afternoon you
[1:32:43] can have it right now this very minute
[1:32:46] when you believe it
[1:32:49] when your faith meets God's requirements
[1:32:54] now I was in a restaurant the other day
[1:32:58] and the waitress come by and she said
[1:33:00] will there be anything else and I said
[1:33:01] no ma'am just just to check
[1:33:03] she said well somebody saw you in here
[1:33:06] and they paid for it
[1:33:09] and I said well let me leave a tip and
[1:33:10] they said no no they left the tip too
[1:33:14] she said so if you don't need nothing
[1:33:15] else
[1:33:16] you can go
[1:33:21] so you see I could have done one or two
[1:33:23] things
[1:33:25] I could have accepted that it was
[1:33:27] already paid for
[1:33:29] or I could have argued
[1:33:32] [Music]
[1:33:34] I could have said ma'am I don't see
[1:33:35] nobody in this restaurant
[1:33:38] that I know
[1:33:40] are you sure you've got the right table
[1:33:43] [Applause]
[1:33:47] are you you're not pulling my leg you
[1:33:50] want me to go out that door so that
[1:33:51] Bella Ding and you can holler he stole
[1:33:53] the stake
[1:33:56] I could have sat there and argued all
[1:33:59] evening
[1:34:01] I could have demanded no ma'am I'm
[1:34:03] paying for it
[1:34:05] or I could have accepted it and walked
[1:34:09] out with a belly full of steak
[1:34:13] well if that's true for the restaurant
[1:34:15] that's true for that quote
[1:34:17] it's already paid for it you don't have
[1:34:20] to argue about it you don't have to
[1:34:22] reason it out you don't have to try to
[1:34:23] figure it out you can just accept it
[1:34:26] he's my healer he's my deliverer
[1:34:28] Hallelujah he's my son
[1:34:31] he's my brother he's my king he's my
[1:34:35] physician he's my comfort he's my joy
[1:34:37] he's my Beast
[1:34:41] Hallelujah
[1:34:43] I said Hallelujah
[1:34:48] yeah
[1:34:49] I say accept it tonight I say receive it
[1:34:52] tonight
[1:34:53] [Music]
[1:34:56] I say Let's Take God at his word
[1:35:02] [Applause]
[1:35:04] gonna have just a few more minutes
[1:35:05] [Applause]
[1:35:07] now I want to look at this before I
[1:35:09] close
[1:35:09] because I I think this is very good
[1:35:19] I want you to listen to this
[1:35:21] [Applause]
[1:35:23] hope versus faith
[1:35:28] no listen to this hope will agree with
[1:35:32] the Bible
[1:35:35] hope will say it's true
[1:35:38] hope will say I believe every bit of it
[1:35:41] hope will say I believe that's the word
[1:35:44] of God
[1:35:45] hope will say I believe that God keeps
[1:35:47] his promise
[1:35:49] hope believes all that
[1:35:52] now everything I read everybody in this
[1:35:54] building we believe that
[1:35:57] hope believes that
[1:36:01] the prophet said hope believes all that
[1:36:04] but hope then says now I believe God
[1:36:07] will heal
[1:36:09] but look at my condition
[1:36:13] that's the difference between Hope and
[1:36:16] Faith
[1:36:17] [Music]
[1:36:18] hope and believe God till you see the
[1:36:20] X-ray
[1:36:23] hope and believe God till you get that
[1:36:25] pain again
[1:36:27] come on somebody but not faith Faith
[1:36:30] don't look at none of that
[1:36:33] Faith stands out there with power on his
[1:36:36] chest muscles come on somebody and faith
[1:36:39] says I believe regardless of the
[1:36:41] condition
[1:36:43] yeah
[1:36:46] faith says I don't care nothing about
[1:36:48] condition Faith Masters every
[1:36:50] circumstance
[1:36:54] when you believe it and take God in his
[1:36:56] word and say it so and believe it so God
[1:36:59] will bring it to pass
[1:37:04] if ye shall say
[1:37:06] if ye shall say
[1:37:08] what is it when you're out from under
[1:37:10] Babylon when you're out from under
[1:37:12] unbelief when you're out from under
[1:37:14] superstitions when you after under all
[1:37:16] these things and you're filled with
[1:37:18] God's own life
[1:37:20] your voice
[1:37:22] is his voice
[1:37:25] you are
[1:37:27] I spoke
[1:37:32] Jesus promised he would heal us if you
[1:37:35] ask anything in my name I'll do it when
[1:37:38] you pray believe that you receive what
[1:37:40] you asked for and you shall have it
[1:37:44] it's yours believe it comes to pass
[1:37:48] [Applause]
[1:37:49] [Music]
[1:37:50] [Applause]
[1:37:53] Faith believes it'll come to pass no
[1:37:56] matter how long
[1:37:57] it takes
[1:38:02] I was in a meeting in Ohio
[1:38:05] and a brother came up we had a mass
[1:38:07] prayer at the order for everybody and
[1:38:09] this brother came up he had a bleeding a
[1:38:11] tumor in his ear had it for three years
[1:38:13] and he told me he was always embarrassed
[1:38:15] because it always looked like his ear
[1:38:16] was dirty he put all kinds of essential
[1:38:19] oils and all these ointments which I've
[1:38:20] got nothing against that but he had used
[1:38:22] all those things and he said it would
[1:38:24] scab over and then it would come off and
[1:38:25] then it would bleed and then it would
[1:38:26] just over and over and over and over and
[1:38:29] he came up for that night and all the
[1:38:31] saints laid hands on one another and the
[1:38:33] brother goes back to his room lays down
[1:38:35] goes to sleep gets up the next morning
[1:38:38] and it's gone
[1:38:40] [Applause]
[1:38:45] that's our God
[1:38:47] that's what God does
[1:38:49] there's a sister in Cottonwood I was
[1:38:51] telling brother Stephen before serving a
[1:38:53] sister down in Cottonwood Arizona had a
[1:38:54] tumor on her chest and she was putting
[1:38:56] ointments and stuff on it and that not
[1:38:58] in the meeting was just just for this
[1:38:59] like you all doing just worshiping and
[1:39:01] enjoying the presence of God and she
[1:39:03] goes home said she took off her blouse
[1:39:05] and that tumor was gold
[1:39:09] that's our God
[1:39:12] does that
[1:39:14] [Applause]
[1:39:17] [Music]
[1:39:20] but God also
[1:39:22] there's a difference between a miracle
[1:39:24] and a Healer
[1:39:29] amen you see the outside world wants you
[1:39:32] to believe as soon as you come up here
[1:39:33] to be prayed for and you've got a Twist
[1:39:35] It Up arm that immediately that arm must
[1:39:37] straighten out well sometimes it does
[1:39:39] that's a miracle
[1:39:42] but whether it does or whether it don't
[1:39:44] it don't change God's word
[1:39:47] and the prophet said the outside world
[1:39:49] wants you to believe as soon as it's
[1:39:50] prayed for it's just straighten out he
[1:39:51] said but the trouble of it is Jesus
[1:39:53] never said that
[1:39:55] he said lay hands on the sick and they
[1:39:57] shall recover but he never said when
[1:40:02] [Applause]
[1:40:04] [Music]
[1:40:06] I was in Alton Missouri
[1:40:07] sister Vera Frost I didn't know her at
[1:40:09] the time since then I've known she just
[1:40:11] went to Glory about six months ago but
[1:40:13] sister very suffered a major stroke and
[1:40:14] the whole right side of her body was
[1:40:15] paralyzed and she walked like this right
[1:40:18] here and her mouth her lips was drawn up
[1:40:20] towards her ear
[1:40:21] and she came up for prayer and she said
[1:40:23] I want you to pray for me I've had a
[1:40:28] stroke
[1:40:31] so we prayed for the sister
[1:40:33] she turned around she drug herself off
[1:40:35] just like that and Satan said you see
[1:40:37] there she came up for help and you
[1:40:40] couldn't help her
[1:40:41] you know what I told the devil I'm not
[1:40:44] the Healer
[1:40:46] Jesus Christ is the Healer he told me
[1:40:49] lay hands on the Sith they shall recover
[1:40:51] I did what he told me to do the rest is
[1:40:55] up to him
[1:40:58] come on somebody
[1:41:01] and about a year later I was back down
[1:41:04] there and this sister come in and
[1:41:05] carrying deer me and she went upcoming
[1:41:07] carrying green beans
[1:41:08] she came in carrying something I said do
[1:41:11] I know you she said yes you do I said
[1:41:13] was you here last year when when I was
[1:41:16] preaching she said yes I was I said
[1:41:17] wasn't you paralyzed on your right side
[1:41:19] she said yes I was I said you're doing
[1:41:22] real good now she said yes I am
[1:41:27] he is the Healer
[1:41:34] when you're praying for it and you asked
[1:41:36] God sincerely we're a unit we're
[1:41:38] together if we ask God sincerely then
[1:41:41] God's obligated to take care of what we
[1:41:43] asked for if you ask anything in my name
[1:41:46] I'll do it
[1:41:48] is that true then take your faith and
[1:41:52] meet whatever it is that's bothering you
[1:41:54] in Jesus name
[1:41:57] when a demon-possessed man who lived
[1:41:59] among the tubes and cut himself day and
[1:42:01] night with the bondage of change and the
[1:42:03] afflictions met the Cry of Faith freedom
[1:42:06] and deliverance came when snake venom
[1:42:08] that Faith the poison was gone when
[1:42:11] Lions meant Faith they purred like
[1:42:13] kittens when fire meant Faith the Heat
[1:42:15] and smoke was nilated when death meant
[1:42:18] Faith Life come forth when sickness
[1:42:19] meant Faith the bleeding stuff when
[1:42:21] walls meant Faith they fell down when
[1:42:24] bondage meant Faith the chains were
[1:42:26] broke then I asked you friends whatever
[1:42:28] it is that's bothering you whatever's in
[1:42:30] your way whatever the circumstance may
[1:42:32] be whatever the bondage is whatever the
[1:42:34] sickness may be whatever the Furious
[1:42:36] what's gonna happen when it meets your
[1:42:39] faith
[1:42:42] all right
[1:42:43] Faith In The God Who made the promise
[1:42:45] Hallelujah I am the Seed of Abraham and
[1:42:49] he promised me that Abraham's seed shall
[1:42:52] possess the gates of his enemies
[1:42:54] [Applause]
[1:42:57] but your faith
[1:42:59] we serve the same God Daniel sir we
[1:43:01] serve the same God Joshua sir we serve
[1:43:04] the same God he has not lost his power
