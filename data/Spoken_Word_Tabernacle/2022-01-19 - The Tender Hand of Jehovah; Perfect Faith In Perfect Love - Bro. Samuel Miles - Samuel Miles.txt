there is three of them i even picked the shortest one amen one was like 75 and i picked the shortest one i say let me give them the shortest one so nobody fall asleep amen if you have not you need to catch up on that one i know some won and some who didn't i know it clearly not here they might be online streaming amen so make sure you get it because on the next two weeks coming up you will need the sermon amen if you want to do yourself a good favorite good treat you can listen to all three if you do it then you're really really really getting ready for the fight amen blessed be the name of the lord i got a new year present i call it new year present i was not aware but i got a beautiful board now amen blessed be the name of the lord the one who bought it doesn't want to say his name they don't even want to tell me who that was they just brought it and put it there so whoever did it god richly bless you but i really really really love it amen if you don't like it that's your problem i really love it it goes up and down you see okay blessed be the name of the lord [Laughter] amen so now we got plenty rooms that we can feel some information in amen there said i believe probably we can use the bug i believe yeah there is yeah so i got four boards in one [Laughter] amen you better get prepared because there's a lot of material coming up amen they are calling for snow i believe on friday brother robert so you stay on the lookout for a message we see we already spray the parking to the best of my understanding so if you're praying to stay home it's not going to happen except if the roads are bad but we already sprayed the parking stay on the look i believe by uh saturday lords willing we will let you know as far as having service here amen blessed be the name of the lord my sister is here tonight with her husband wow what a surprise she's back there god bless you amen blessed be the name of the lord our house meeting for question and answer was supposed to be this saturday i believe you all receive a text message that we push it to next saturday number one there is a weather issue number two brother dwayne thomas funeral will be on saturday morning so if you want to attend the funeral just let one of the deacon know we can give you the information how you can get there it's probably an hour and 30 minutes from charlotte to the best of my understanding so if you want to be there you want to know the information and everything just talk to one of the deacon and we will give you the information to get there and also brother kelly will be traveling probably on uh friday he lost his niece in florida and he will be going there for the funeral amen so lord willing he probably will be the one speaking in the funeral so you keep them in prayer keep the family in prayer and brother dwayne's family in prayer for travel mercy so the lord can go with them and bring them back safe here man so just suffer a little bit so we can push question and answer toward next saturday lord's willing amen so the house meeting question and answer is for the 29th if you still have your question please put them on the box and then we can handle them i have not seen new questions yet i still have some of the old left all i saw was the sisters the young sisters meeting question and answer they got very good question and answer compared to the young boys the boys acted like they know everything we know good and i know they don't know everything or everybody want to act cool the first time like let me see the first one who's on the job that's a boy's attitude they just you go first you go first but the sisters praise god it's good question we will dig into it and then come up with something if you have more we have not set up the day today just go ahead and put your question there this is your opportunity i'm here we're going to go through the word we're gonna go through the message and come up with everything and give it to you whatever you have for question put it there before you get on youtube and google and amazon and start buying books and everything we don't want that amen we're there to help you up remember that amen yeah internet is a is a deadly ground very deadly ground so if you don't want to get in trouble just stay out of him amen blessed be the name of the lord and lord's willing i believe i was supposed to preach tonight and thank god brother sam was handy to help me especially with my voice i needed some arrest and get the voice back again so brother sam is going to be preaching tonight and lord's willing pray for me so everything is well and we can pick up on sunday morning amen i know people travel people comes back i don't have any problem with that i understand it but if you can stay put in the next three weeks it will be very good amen we gotta help you up amen if you out because i know people that don't come on wednesday they won't listen to them when's the message amen i know they might ask a question did you listen no and probably they won't even listen to it amen so try your best if you can stay around it will be better because we need to get you out of confusion amen yeah the message is not a religion the message of brother branham is not a religion amen when we started at a hotel i know brother john kept uh reminded me this brother john is probably streaming he said brother stephen you stopped a ruth you remember that and brother robert it was the second one you stopped a roof and then from roof we went through refereed them brother kelly and we stopped in resident then we went to the black dog territory because the lord want to clean you up amen we started with the unchanging pattern of god right we laid the foundation for malachi 4 then we started with the book of esther and stop and went to roof and stop and when to the black dog god every time god bring a message to you if you very careful about it in that message there is a power to deliver you did you get that if god preached to you about the high heel automatically there is power in that message to deliver you because before you didn't know it was bad now when the lord is coming it's like a light that is shining and showing you the imperfection when you see it if you just take it and apply it god will back you up and get that stuff out of your life amen but if you don't then that grace is passing and he's moving again picking up somebody else amen that's why you see we going through a direction we stop and we drop into something and he went through the type of love and smoking and cigarette i mean cigarette and drinking all the stuff we went through it was just the holy ghost cleaning the church up of everything amen but some of you didn't get clean up amen so he comes back again and because he wanted to take one of her sister home did you see what he did he began to preach about the first death the second death the mystery of death and position the church and when the sister is taken out the pen is not too strong and he stabilized the church then he move up and he goes again a different way that's the wisdom of the holy spirit he have nothing to do with me amen but what is important and i promise to enter this and i saw it in the tabernacle god spoke to us about our origin amen origin is good because you gotta know where you come from amen if you a pope in this world you came straight from hell i can prove to you by the scripture amen there's no way you can be a child of god period that's it amen so there is you must know where you come from you got to know if you coming from god or if you're coming from hell because they are the children of god you remember and they are also children of the devil so knowing that is very important because it takes the anxiety off of you first so the devil won't be playing with your mind amen but the next step is the one that is very very important you already know you're a child of god that's okay praise god the next question is where are you in your work with god that's where the tabernacle now is gonna unfold you where you are amen you must know where you are this have nothing to do with how many years you're in the message anybody here anybody here because if you're in the message for 20 years and you are still cussing you don't have the holy ghost anybody care i don't care how many people told you you have the holy ghost you don't have the holy ghost i'm not saying you are not a child of god did you get me i'm not saying you don't have you are not the child of god you are a child of god but the problem is you are in a step that you do not understand this is the problem all along in the message that's why people struggle in the message for years because you don't know where you are anybody care is fever something good one way fever is bad one-way fever is good it depends on where you know or how you look in it we don't want fever but fever is just something telling you something is wrong anybody care everybody if not you will continue to take tylenol and motrin but you don't solve the problem did you hear me did you get what i'm trying to say amen if you look at fever as something that is bad you will go for motion and take motion and take spiritual tylenol and you're going to feel better a while and then after a while the fever will come back again you hear me that's why you feel better in church and after a while you see the habit pop up back again after a while in other words your life is going up and down everybody care someday you feel like ah i really gather i have the anointing i feel good after two three months you down again and you see the old stuff keep coming back up again you don't understand and the devil likes it because the people don't understand where they are keep thinking you're a child of god and you keep spitting yourself around amen amen so if you understand that fever is just a sign telling you that something is wrong in your body then you on different road then it's going to take you to the hospital and they're going to diagnose what it is and give you the appropriate medication probably you don't even need much tylenol because you can damage your liver but if you take some antibiotics straight ahead you can solve the problem did it make sense you see what i'm trying to say so you can be in this message for five years 10 years 15 years and your life doesn't change anybody care you are a child of god but you're not progressing everybody a habit is lingering in your life for 10 years something is wrong everybody the station of god the way god plays his station those stations have deliverance if you reach the first station it's going to do something in your life then you gotta leave that station quickly and move to the second one if you don't move to the second one you're gonna stay there for 25 years in the message and the message became a religion everybody that's why you see people going to church in the message coming back but there is no difference between them and somebody who doesn't believe the message the only difference is they don't drink don't smoke but if you check their life there is no difference yet they're in the message but you cannot be satisfied if you don't see the supernatural in your life do you hear me you hear me don't be satisfied to hear god talk to abraham god must talk to you you must walk up someday in the morning and say okay that god is real i heard him talking to me not talking to joseph that's fine not talking to david that's fine that god must speak to you personally not somebody telling you the lord told me to tell you you and god talking amen you need that if not you are just presuming and when trials come you back again to where you came from and then before you know it it's a depression it seems like you have to be in church all the time to be maintaining a certain atmosphere so try to stay in church for the next one month amen so we will show you where you are not me the holy ghost will show you where you are and then from there you will try to find out where should i be amen and then your life will change anybody care we cannot continue with you spinning around it's not going to help you amen when trial comes you down and then tomorrow you happy then you down then you happy then you die then it becomes like a habit like a episode in your life no something is wrong amen you have not detected or decoded the sounds very good you are giving tylenol and motion it's not helping you need to know who you are you need to know where you are in your work are you in step one or step two or step three or step four if you on one then you gotta wake up so don't fool yourself if you on one don't fool yourself you got the holy ghost don't fool yourself just acknowledge i don't have the holy ghost then you stop pushing everybody here the problem is we are one and we say i have the holy ghost i have it praise the lord your life is proving to you that you don't have it everybody here fruit is fruit when they look at fruit it's fruit they don't manufacture them it's there if you don't have it it means that life is not there it's it's easy everybody did that burst your bible amen it is god bringing deliverance to you everybody remember so remember this it's not something to condemn you it is the grace of god that is trying to show you where you are because the hour is late so we can get our life line up together and we can be ready for the rapture you don't want to be caught off guard thinking you were right when you are not gift and calling are without repentance anybody care you follow your gift you might be not having the holy ghost and you're going to get lost everybody care we want you to have your gift but we want you to know for sure whether you have the holy ghost or not and if you have the holy ghost where are you what are you supposed to do which station do you have to move in the tabernacle amen i'm thinking to you this is serious have peter walk in the water pee the walk in the water did he have the holy ghost you didn't answer did he have the holy ghost go to a pentecostal who walk in water tell him you don't have the holy ghost he's not going to believe you he will say i have the holy ghost look at the lord walking with me on the water but peter walked on the water without the holy ghost until jesus looked at him and say when you get converted did did peter preach the gospel you need to read your bible did peter preach the gospel how can jesus tell him to be converted he was already a minister you see now you see now you see now so standing on the pulpit is not enough anybody care you got to know where you are with the lord until you come out from the upper room like peter then it's a different peter amen then peter is willing to die for the lord jesus christ everybody here because peter preached the gospel peter prayed for the sick people they got healed peter walked on the water but when they put pressure on him are you the one identify with this message of the hour do you know what peter did the bible say he even curse i have the scripture if you want to why because when the showdown comes your color will show up telling you that peter you another it took brother branham to unfold all the disciples stages brother branham opened them all up like this that's why we need a prophet brother branham came and say all of them were in this stage that's the reason why they were all struggling when they came to arrest jesus christ who stood with jesus christ you see now you don't want people to come to this message and you don't want to stand for the message you see why we need to get closer with god sorry i took some time it's a preview to prepare you to pray to listen to the word to get ready so the lord can bring a deliverance and get a get you from one to two whoever is in two to three whoever is in three to four amen let's sing only believe sorry about the same only believe oh we believe all things are possible [Music] me [Music] all things are possible lord i believe [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] my [Music] jesus is here is [Music] jesus [Music] oh [Music] [Music] amen we're counting on that amen i bet you'll be seated just for a minute before we read the scripture i just want to thank brother polycarp for that wonderful message going beyond the camp going beyond the camp brother seth i'm not going to try to sing tonight if i was i'd ask for your help i i won't i won't try to sing while my brother says we certainly do appreciate our musicians don't we amen and our singers that zade is a wonderful singer so many good singers so much talent amongst the bride of jesus christ and we're so glad that we're part of this great family that god has allowed us to be but i i was so impressed with that message that brother polycarp brought the other day i wanted to read this quote out of going beyond the camp and it's in it's on paragraph 48 he said you know i was told some time ago that they had a jet plane now that can make them noises where we hear around here that shakes windows it's when the plane has got so fast that it crosses its own sound called the sound barrier you're familiar with that brother polycarp yes amen and when it goes beyond the sound barrier it's almost unlimited to what it'll do and he said and i think in there that we get a great lesson when we go beyond our own sound barrier into the word of god then it's unlimited what god can do with a man that's ready to go beyond the camp the camp of man that is now we see that going beyond the camp going beyond this oh how i do appreciate that message that our brother brought i've i've feasted on it for a long time i've always liked that message going beyond the camp you go beyond the camp of your reasoning you go beyond the camp of your imaginations of your memories of your affections of what you can see what you can feel what you can taste and now you understand what you're doing when you're going beyond the camp of what you can do you're entering into the camp of what he can do and that's where we want to get to it's not about us it's about what jesus christ can do when we as a body of jesus christ completely yield ourselves and we're no longer living by what our five senses tell us whether to be the five senses of the flesh or the five senses of the spirit amen amen and we sure do appreciate uh the lord jesus and i'd like to speak tonight on a message that the lord put on my heart the tender hand of jehovah the tender now if you think you know what a tender hand is we're about to get educated the tender hand of jehovah and for a subtitle i like to use this perfect faith in perfect love the tender hand of jehovah and we're talking about perfect faith in perfect love it's one thing to know god know all about god but if you don't have faith in god it will profit you nothing let's turn in our bibles if we could stand just for a minute to hebrews chapter 3 and verse 12 hebrews chapter 3 and verse 12. if you're there say amen give just another minute or two i like brother steve because he likes for his audience to be where he's at caught up he wants them to understand what's being said and the message is clear and our god is no mumble jumble he says what he means and he means what he says and because that he says what he means and he means what he says it's easy for believers to have faith in god and the reason that people don't have faith in god is because truly they are not believers let's see what this example is before us here and uh hebrews everybody hebrews chapter 3 and verse 12. he says take heed brethren lest there be any of you lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief unbelief is the worst disease a human being can have it's worse than leprosy excuse me oh you're wasting your time praise the lord take heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living god but exhort one another daily while it is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin for we are made partakers of christ if if's a big word it's only two letters but it's a big word we are made partakers of christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end now that word confidence is a very same word as faith if you have confidence in something you have faith in something and so what he's saying if we are made partakers of christ if we hold the beginning of our faith steadfast to the end while it is said today if you will hear his voice and remember hear the voice doesn't just mean that you hear it with your ears it means that you understand what the voice said and when you understand it and then you believe it that means that you have faith in it and you watch where all the doubt will go when you simply can take god at his word harden out your heart as in the provocation for some when they heard did provoke how be it not all that came out of egypt by moses but with whom he was grieved forty years was it not with them that had sinned whose carcass carcasses fell in the wilderness and to whom swear he that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believe not so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief all right here we go verse chapter 4 let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest his rest any of you should seem to come short of it for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them they had the gospel preached to him what was the problem they didn't hold their confidence steadfast to the end and when the trials came the heartaches came the sorrows came they didn't know the tender hand of jehovah was just leading them to the promised land and therefore they fainted in the way and because of that god was not pleased we're going to get into it in a minute for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it amen let's turn if we could over to um uh ephesians chapter 4 again i like the book of ephesians you know brother branham said that uh ephesians parallels joshua ephesians chapter four we know that faith comes by and hearing the and how can we hear without a and how can a preacher preach except he be oh we got bible readers here today amen i like that so now let's go over to hebrews chapter 4 and we're going to pick it up in verse 11 again and let's just see the gifts that god gave see because i just see in this message that there that people want to eliminate the word you cannot take one word out of the book all the words he said if you take one word out of the book he said your name will be taken out of the book of life if you add one word to the book he said the plagues that are in the book will be added unto you so we cannot shine light on on malachi 4 and not shine light on ephesians 4 they work hand in hand amen and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come in the unity of the faith are we in the unity of the faith all in the unity of the faith we're not quitting until they we all go we're not leaving one hoof behind we're not leaving one child behind we're not leaving our sisters behind we're not leaving our brothers behind we are going to edify each other we're going to build each other up until we all come in the unity of the faith and watch this this is where we're coming to right now i'll come in the unity of the faith unto end of the knowledge of the son of man unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ that we henceforth brother stephen are no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love now what do we have we've got perfect faith in perfect love and that perfect faith and perfect love will always bear the perfect fruit of the spirit and it's by your fruit that jesus said that they would know you it's not by what you think you know it's by the fruit that you bear let's just pray lord jesus now we have done all that we can do father we've spent time lord today in your presence lord and we just feel like you have a message something that you want to say to the people tonight and father now we just ask you lord that you allow us to step aside to get out of the way and to allow you lord jesus to to help us to come in behind the veil let the curtain drop behind us lord god and may we just feast on the on the ever present word water from the rock we ask it in jesus christ's name amen god bless you you can be seated amen let's talk about the tender hand of jehovah the tender hand of jehovah in a message called the third exodus on paragraph 45 brother branham uses this term the tender hand of jehovah but when i first read it brother uh stephen it just shook me i thought wow who could ever look at the holocaust and call it the tender hand of jehovah but that prophet knew exactly what he was talking about and and he was able to bring it into such a light that that you could look at it and you could say i was in i was in germany and when we were in germany sister teresa and i had a chance to go to dachau and daca was one of the concentration camps where they burned so many bodies of the jews that they couldn't burn them fast enough they just kept piling up and they couldn't burn them fast enough and it's a horrible as you walk into the gates of dachau even to this time now they burnt all the barracks down to the ground and the only thing that they have left on there is the uh is the foundations where the barracks were at and where and they they still have the ovens there where that they burned these bodies of of these jewish and why just because they were jews just because they were jews and you say well how then can let's read this quote here he says as it was in germany and in up into russia and italy and the people raised up josephson hitler and stalin and mussolini who hated the jews they had to go back to their homeland god yes got ways of doing things that we don't understand and you press them no home in germany everything taken away from them and let me just clue the you clue this into it happened overnight it happened almost instantaneously they were living their everyday lives yes there was pressure coming pressure coming pressure but when the actual hammer fell as it were it was the night of broken glass and it was brown shirts nazi brown shirts that was going through the cities breaking glass out of store windows they turned around and blamed it on the jews and then god got the jews up in the middle of the night and made them walk even barefooted across the broken glass and blamed them the jews for what had happened that night and the jews had nothing to do with it so the thing of it is when satan springs his trap he springs it very quickly and we who have our eyes on the word of god will not be caught unawares but people that are just lingering around lingering around waiting for for for noah to get into the ark and then they they stayed on the outside so well the ark hasn't left yet the rain doesn't come and they just waited on the outside but they didn't realize god shut the door there was no more way back in that's the way satan does it every time and so now he says you press them no home in germany everything taken away also in italy and russia no place to go and they were sent back to their homeland just to fulfill the word oh brother branham says the loving hand of god how sometimes it looks cruel of the way people suffer but it's still it's the tender hand of jehovah leading his children we thank you lord amen see we have to be children of understanding and faith comes by hearing hearing the word god did not send us the gifts that he sent us in this church just for us to sit back in our laurels and say we're christians i don't want to look like a christian walk like a christian talk like a christian that's not my goal i want to die i want everything about me to be dead and i want jesus christ to resurrect the literal life of jesus christ to come into my body possess my body and live himself out through me i don't want to be religious i don't want to be a message person i want to be a believer of this message i want to have faith in this message and when it says things that i don't understand look at this this is an uncertain sound brother braham said this in 1961 and he said it about four or five times from 1957 on up to 61. he says now we're living in a day of uncertainty we live in the day where there's everything almost that we can put our hands on on the natural is uncertain you think he was reading our morning newspaper i mean everything's uncertain you go to the grocery store you say wait a minute those shelves used to be full and now they don't even know why they're not full yet theresa rides down the road she says she says sam we've got all these tractor-trailers going up and down the road how come i don't have groceries on my shelf i said i don't know that's a good question right but it's uncertainty everything is uncertain but listen the uncertainty is not for the children of god because our eyes are not our faith is not controlled by what we see our faith is not controlled by our emotions i told teresa i hope when that day comes when we go to reach something in our cupboard and there's nothing in our cupboard i hope that we'll have the faith to sit down at our table and thank god pray over an empty plate and thank god for the food that he [Applause] provided no doubt hold faster confidence steadfast to the end we cannot waver we cannot but if our faith if we have time to get over in the numbers 13 we'll find a group of men that was that was being uh uh led around by what they could see with their eyes and then when that when they came back to give a report they gave an evil report but there was other men of another spirit but let me finish reading this here i hope we can get on into that we'll see how the lord leads okay so we live in a day where everything's uncertain almost almost that we can put our hands on is uncertain there's so much uncertainty till the nations are quaking there's uncertainty in our national security for sure for sure how many feels comfortable with our president and our vice president i don't sleep good at night because of my president or my vice president i sleep well at night because my god is jehovah [Applause] national answer there is no nation safe anymore we could either be the victims of russia now this is in 1961 he's saying this we could be the victims of russia by midnight tonight or either be in bits it depends on what russia wants to do about it we're talking about our scientists he said they have men that they can put 200 miles in the air in a little machine to come right over set them right down on top of this nation and send the message out and say either surrender or we'll pull the lever and that's all of it they don't have to wait till tomorrow to do it they can do it right now this is in 1961 he said that i'm going to read you an article in a minute i'm going to read you an article about what putin said the first of last year now watch this he said if we were sensible what would we do what would the pentecost what would the nation do it would surrender they would have to uh they would have then then what would happen wave after wave of russian soldiers would climb into our country taking your homes kicking you out into the street shoot you kill your children before you and take over the nation that's in 1961. anybody but think this brother wasn't a prophet listen to what uh putin said in in november mr putin himself suggested this is november of 2021. he said mr putin himself suggested russia could deploy submarine based hypersonic missiles within close striking distance of washington he has said repeatedly that the prospect of a western military expansion in the ukraine poses an unacceptable risk because it could be used to launch a nuclear strike against moscow within a few minutes warning russia he made clear could do the same from the from the beginning of the year we will have in our arsenal a new sea-based missile hypersonic one mr putin said referring to a weapon that travels at more than five times the speed of sound and could likely evade existing missile defenses it's an apparent reference to the american capital he added the flight time to reach those who give orders will be five minutes can you imagine washington make a decision in five minutes not likely not not likely he also said this in reference to that remark and in 1957 he said let me tell you he said the church won't see that she's going to be gone she's going to be gone when that time comes i hope nobody was getting nervous when i read all that hold fasts your confidence even when it looks like god is opposed against us and it looks like everything is going crazy we maintain our faith in god because we believe what god said and that's all that we need to know about it now what did god say god said he make everything work together for our good are you called according to his purpose he said that that he wouldn't allow anything to come upon you but what you are able to bear amen why do you think job wasn't shaken why do you think when joe woke up and all of his children was gone and his cattle was gone and didn't shake job a bit he probably wondered what was going on he probably stood back and looked at it you know job was slow to speak he was slow to anger he just watched things as they was unvalued saying well lord what's going on probably he probably was doing some praying but you know what the bible said job did it said that he got down on his hands and knees and he worshipped god he said naked i came into the world and naked i'll go out of the world blessed be the name of the lord and what we are able to see because we've got the bible to open up that other dimension is what was going on in heaven which was producing what was going on in earth and there in the heavens satan was saying if you let me have job i can get him to curse you and god said no i don't think you can do it he said so you can go ahead and touch job touch all that he has but don't you take his life amen jehovah was in control the whole time and you know that the trials from job chapter 1 got him ready for the trials in job chapter 2 because there came a second plate and satan came up before god and god said wow my goodness gracious what do you think about my servant job he's a perfect and upright man he issues evil and and satan said the whole skin for skin he said you let me touch everything but you won't let me touch him you let me touch him and i'll get him to curse you to your face you see and god once again said okay you can do all that you want but don't you kill him don't you kill him and that's exactly what job what satan did he went in and he attacked but you see it was it was god preparing his servants and brother branham gave us the illustration of the big old oak tree and when the winds come and they blow against that tree and it looks like the tree is getting ready to be blown over and we don't understand what's going on but what's going on is that the roots down underneath the ground are loosening up and then the rains come and get down in there and it feeds that tree and it grows a little taller and the roots grow deeper and that's what's going on in your life when say when god allows satan god doesn't tempt anybody but god allows satan to tempt us you see and try to push us and test our faith but all he's doing is he's causing our faith to go deeper get more rooted and grounded what's your faith rooted and grounded in who said it love being paul said being rooted and grounded in love love my friends is what's binding the church together we we we have so much love for each other that when one has a heartache we all shed a tear amen amen and so with job just being an example to us of what it is for satan to keep a pushing and trying and and and and and it's not going to hurt us it's not god is is is is working things out together for our good but see what happened here is that the the children of israel when they were tempted and tried they didn't have faith in what god said let's turn over to the book of numbers let's just go over to the book of numbers we'll do a little bible study here for a few minutes amen oh my numbers chapter 13 the tender hand of jehovah just think about the eagle when she stirs her nest the eagle when she stirs her nose when those babies are born what does mama eagle do she goes out and she gets all these uh rabbit skins and furs and she lines that that nest all nice and comfortable and the babies are born the little eggs to hatch out and and and and mama feeds those little birds just as as keeps them just as comfortable she can be but then there comes a time when mamba eagle knows that it's time for those little chicks to leave the nest and what does she do she pulls all that rabbit fur out they was sleeping on a real nice comfortable uh what they call a sort of perfect uh uh sleeper and all of a sudden now they got nothing but thorns and you go through life and everything going so smoothly oh it's so nice to be a christian and then all of a sudden you run into a few trials a few tribulations [Music] and if you're living by what you can feel you'll be shaken but if you're anchored in faith it won't shake you a bit you'll know do you know that peter peter came to such a place in his walk with god that when he thought about his trials he said that the trying of his faith was more precious than gold tried in a fire have you come to that point have you come to a point in your walk with god that when things start going upside down you say oh my what is god doing for me today what is god trying to work out in my life today i like the uh the the analogy that brother stephen brought us of of uh michelangelo when he went out and he got the was it michelangelo or got the sculpture got that block went down to the quarry and then he brought that that block up and set it up there and he just kept chipping away and chipping away and chipping away you see and some days is rougher than others some days the holy ghost sees a big chunk on there's got to come out and he just and you're going what in the world is going on but the only thing he's doing is going down to the corridors of your conduct and he's walking down into the chambers of your of your character and he's rooting out and he's getting everything out inside of there that is not christ the lord spake unto moses saying send thou men that they may search out the land of canaan which i give the children of israel of every tribe their father shall ye send them in every one a ruler among them and moses by the commandment of the lord sent them from the wilderness of piranha all those men were heads of the children of israel and then he goes and he lists all of the men that went there was uh 12 of them and if you'll notice in verse 8 he sends from the tribe of osh of of ephraim o shia the son of nun oshia is actually hosea i thought it was joshua let's read verse 16. and these are the names of the men which moses sent to spy out the land and moses called the name of ushia the son of nun joshua see he had a name change hosea means salvation but joshua means jehovah is salvation there comes a time where you stop trusting in your abilities and all of a sudden it's jehovah is what's important and it doesn't matter if jehovah is stirring your nest or if he's making you comfortable it doesn't matter your faith in jehovah is not dependent on on your physical condition it's dependent on one thing he said it i believe it and that settles it amen i like that [Music] in verse 17 it says moses sent them out to spy the land of canaan and said unto them get you up this way southward and go up into the mountains and see the land that it what it is and the people that dwell therein whether they be strong or weak few or many and what the land is that they dwell in whether it be good or bad and what the cities there be that they dwell in whether they be tents or strongholds and what the land is whether it be fed or lean whether it be wood therein or not but be of good courage and bring the fruit of the land now the time was the time of first ripe groups grapes so they went up and searched the land and went into the wilderness of zinn under rohab as men they come from amoth and they ascended up by the south and came to hebron where ahaman and shishei and tamai and the children of enac were now hebron was built seven years before zoan of in egypt and they came to the brook of ishkol and they cut down fence a branch it says a branch with one everybody say one cluster of grapes a branch one cluster and they bear it upon a they bear it between two upon a staff those were some kind of grapes i wouldn't want to buy those grapes by the pound mercy goodness can you imagine if you had to pay a dollar a pound for those grapes mercy and they buried between two upon a staff and they brought the pomegranates and the figs and the place where the uh and and the place was called the brook eshkol because of the cluster of grapes which the children of israel cut down from fence now friends the pastor was talking earlier in his exhortation that it's the fruit the fruit that that if if we could understand all the mysteries of god would that make us anything what if we had faith to move mountains would that make us anything oh we got bible readers what if i bestowed my body to be burned as a sacrifice would that make me anything if you read in first corinthians 13 you can do all those things but if we don't have love now i want to stretch our imaginations a little bit because brother branham said that we should live for the person who would kill us if they could so love is not just doing good for people that do good for us amen teresa and i was having a discussion this morning when brother stephen called and we just got through thinking and i said theresa i said think about the person that just agitates you the most think about the person that irritates you the most and so i happen to know one that kind of irritates both of us i mean i know juan that i know kind of irritates both of us she just they just have that way brother kelly you can kind of crawl up underneath your skin you know just when they come around you just you wanna you wanna hide i would really appreciate this board because i could hide and so i said well let me name one and she said okay and so i named i'm like a name and now this goes out on youtube and i found out that a lot of people listen to youtube i ain't falling into that trap oh no it's not you kathy i promise kathy's listening tonight i'll know now if she listened because she'll tell me about this and so i mentioned the name to teresa and i know sooner mentioned in her smile she just went ear to ear with a grill gun yes that's right and i said now from your soul from your soul do you love that person friends amen think about it for a minute the anointing of jesus christ if we had time to read all of chapter 13 i could get into 14 you would find out that the that that that that the that these people came back with a good let me just let me just summarize it for you can read it yourself i don't want to take the time reading it but but but the the but but the children of israel went up into the the promised land they brought back the grapes they brought back the figs they brought back the pomegranates and they proved that it was a goodly land amen there was 12 of them went up 10 of them came back saying there's no way we can take the land the giants in the land the cities are walled they're too big for us the cities are fortified there's no way that we can take the land and it said that they went and they stirred the people up and caleb who who had uh was of another spirit the scripture says went over and he tried to calm him down and say oh but we're more than able to take the land jehovah's with us jehovah's already given us the land don't even consider the obstacles we can do it but that didn't settle the people and they got to the point they got so riled up let me read you this quote if i can find it quickly it's out of a message called stand still and see the salvation of god he says when god gets ready to do anything the people is all tore up the reason they're tore up in their journey is because there went out a mixed multitude now look we've been thinned out here after that last episode and and we're thinned out but everybody in here believes william branham was a prophet they got no problem you know everything brother branham said wasn't thus saith the lord and if if you feel that way it's okay with me i'm not going to argue with anybody but and everything that brother branham said was not does saith the lord if everything he said was thus saith the lord then when he said he made mistakes that was thus saith the lord i heard it come from a very renowned person in jeffersonville i'm not mentioning any names we're on youtube but people will know who said this that know him he said god doesn't make mistakes and neither does his prophets which prophet didn't make a mistake can anybody name one prophet that didn't make a mistake jesus jesus he was born a prophet they were humans they had their own opinions they had said things there's things that brother branham said that i cannot find that that would would ring true but i'm not throwing brother branham away there's such a richness there's such a such a uh uh uh uh a a treasure trove brother steven and i was talking about it earlier there's such a such a treasure trove of inspiration in their messages but this is its friends he said when god gets ready to do anything the people is all tore up the reason they were tore up in their journey is because there was a mixed multitude that went up and the testing time came oh i want you to notice this that every time that god makes a move there's usually a mixed multitude it attracts the attention of all and creates a mixed multitude when god makes a move you'll find all kinds of isms and everything moving with it but the testing time came and god tests every son or daughter that comes to him no exceptions at all god gives them the testing time to prove them hebrews chapter 12 every child that comes to god must first be tested and if you're without chastisement the bible says that you're illegitimate amen oh my god oh it's nothing but the truth anyways it's all right amen and so now the the here's the thing so so now getting back to my thought the the the the children of israel was bringing back an evil report they were stirring up the congregation and you know it came to the point to where they actually want to stone moses and aaron and god pulls moses off to the side and says to moses just separate yourself he said i'll make of you a great nation and i'll destroy this people now can you imagine what did moses do did he say okay fine i'll just step out of the way he put himself in the breach for them people and he said no he said you take me and save them alive now you think about the person that just gets your goat and agitates you more than anything else if it came to a point to where that you knew that their life was in in jeopardy and you could put yourself in their place and they could be saved do you see brother branham said that was christ in moses amen amen it was christ the same anointing in jesus as he hung on the cross and the very people that nailed him to the cross and he cried out and said father don't lay the sin to their charge amen and it doesn't stop there some years later there were stephen all he was doing was having a bible study trying to explain things to people and draw them out of their of their legalistic hebrew ideas and they got angry and they threw them out in the street and they start to cast stones at him was he bitter was he angry it was it was christ that was inside stephen who prayed for him and said lay not this sin to the church amen now this christ remember the text it's the tender hand of jehovah and perfect faith in perfect love perfect love is the bond of perfectness perfect love casts out all fear so if you're fearful and you're afraid then get back in communion with perfect love commune in the beginning it said god created right is that what your bible says in the beginning god created now we know according to john 4 24 that god is a what a spirit and according to john first john chapter 3 god is love so would we be wrong to read the scripture to say this brother robert in the beginning perfect love created the heavens and the earth see we have to be identified with what god is and this god he's so gentle he doesn't barge into in on us and and and and and tell us what he's going to do in our lives a gentle knock just a gentle knock and we open up our hearts and we invite him to come in perfect love taking up residence in our mortal beings now we're going somewhere so stay with me perfect faith in perfect love brother branham said when he went beyond the curtain of time and he saw those people in that other dimension and they were all young in the prime of life and they were all running at him and they were saying my precious mother my precious brother my precious brother what did he say you had to have to get into that land perfect love so it's perfect love in the beginning it's perfect love in the end and it's perfect love right now and a person that is possessed of perfect love is not easily shaken they have an understanding that god knows what he's doing and when it doesn't appeal to our natural five senses see tastes feel smell or here it doesn't shake us a bit and paul told us that we should cast down reasonings and imaginations and anything that exalts itself above god and let me give you this too paul himself an apostle filled with the holy ghost and he made this statement he said i have to bring my body into subjection least when i preach to others i myself become a castaway oh the message of the black dog when we realize that your that our flesh has got nothing to do with god it's an enmity to god it's a carnal nature to god and the only thing that we can do with our flesh is to bring it in subjection and that's why paul said in in romans 6 16 he to whom you yield your members servants to obey his servants you are and so bringing ourselves into subjection is is to the spirit of god is what makes us the servants of god amen oh my friend we're on a journey from mortal to immortal is that right and there's only one thing that i know of in the scripture that will take our mortal bodies and make them immortal and that's perfect love perfect love now listen here the bible said in romans 8 11 it said if the spirit of him who raised up christ from the dead can we all agree that it was the spirit of perfect love that raised up christ from the dead if the spirit of him that raised up christ from the dead dwell in you then he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken that is make alive your mortal bodies by the spirit of him that's dwelling in you and it's an everyday rugged walking talking fellowshipping with jesus christ is what brings us into a perfect communion with him and you will know that you're in that perfect communion with him when you have love for those that despise you would you like to read that in the scripture let's turn to luke chapter 6. it's all about jesus it's all about jesus it's all about letting jesus this is not religion let's read verse 35 635 he said but if you love your enemies and do good and lend hoping for nothing again and your reward will be great and you shall be [Music] the children of the highest to me that's pretty simple that's pretty straightforward right there can we read it again let's read it again listen this is not natural to human to human nature we must be completely surrendered to jesus christ this is something that only jesus can do don't try to do this on your own it'll it'll come out it'll come out fake it'll come out phony this takes the holy ghost this takes a hunger this takes a thirst blessed are you that you hunger and thirst after righteousness for you shall be filled but love you your enemies and do good lend hoping for nothing again and your reward shall be great it doesn't say anything about you shall be called the children of the highest it says and you shall be the children of the highest for he and we're talking about the highest brother robert when i read this it just spun me around there's nothing worse than an unthankful person i think i will it's truth how many has ever done something for somebody and you thought oh they're gonna be so grateful yes sir and you don't even get a thank you did you ever do that you ever you ever do something for somebody i don't even say thank you they don't even appreciate it but look what melchizedek does we're talking about melchizedek here we're talking about the highest we're the children of the highest we're talking about the tender hand of jehovah we're talking about perfect faith and perfect love look at this for he is kind to the unthankful and to the evil it's kind i don't know if that pinches your toes but it pinches mine you know i i've got i got more moving up to do brother robert look i ain't pointing my fingers at nobody but i have one learned one thing i'm not making uh my comparison to brother shambo or brother robert or any other brother i've got my eyes stayed on jesus christ and brother kelly i found out that when i find a flaw there's nothing that i can do to correct it but i found a source that when i come to that source and i say father i need to move closer [Music] he says son i was just waiting for you to ask come up a little higher read the message how shall i overcome and see if the prophet i can call him what he wants to to me he's a prophet in simplicity a little kentucky hillbilly that could talk in a way that i could understand and he said do you want to know how you overcome he said a little child tries to put on his coat and you hand him his coat he says i can do it daddy and he goes and he puts his coat on and he comes back and you know what's all inside out said daddy i got my coat on and your papa god i hope you know him as papa god we're not talking about somebody that's trying to put his thumb on us we're talking about somebody that loves us that once they hear from us that cares about us and he wants us all to be fruit inspectors but he doesn't want me inspecting your fruit he don't even want me inspecting your fruit or yours or my wife's i told her i said i ain't inspecting your fruit we're fruit inspectors judge yourself and you won't be judged it's nothing but the truth a man amen isn't god good i forgot what i was saying but it's okay god's still good what's that thank you not only is a good preacher and a good dentist but he's a good friend see when you're with family you don't have to worry if i was a bunch a bunch of if i was amongst a bunch of religious people i'd be up here saying oh my god what am i going to do i lost my thought i lost my time but one with your family you say anybody help me out i lost my tongue and so so the little boy had the coat and he tried to put it on and he and and he gets it on all backwards and then he finally turns around and looks at his daddy and says daddy will you help me put my coat on that's how you overcome that's how you overcome just we're trying to put on perfect love but when you look into your soul and you see yourself coming up short there's no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus who don't walk after the flesh but they walk after the spirit but now we can turn to our father and we say father i'm having trouble with this or i'm having trouble with that and you know what's going to happen you're going to come into the service the next week because the pastor said make sure you're here for the next three to four weeks and god's going to give him a message that's going to address exactly what you have need and you're going to go away and you're going to say thank you lord jesus friends we're talking about a god that loves us we're talking about perfect faith and perfect love we're talking about the tender hand of jehovah and when everything looks like it's going upside down friend it's just god working something together for your good don't worry don't be afraid don't be frustrated god is still in control do you believe it amen let's just stand to our feet and go to him in a word of prayer lord jesus we're just your children and we're so grateful lord that you gave us the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father and lord we know lord jesus christ that we're waiting lord for the red for for that adoption to come to full fruition which we know lord god is the redemption of these bodies and lord then we'll have a spirit and a body that will be matching together and so will ever be with the lord there'll be no more frustration no more heartache no more sorrow no more tear and lord i pray father for every one lord jesus that will hear this message whether it be by the way of of being here in person or by the way of youtube or or or some other way if they hear it lord god i pray that you go out and bless them with understanding so that they can see how short this life is and lord if we save our lives we're going to lose it but if we give our lives for the cause of christ then we'll save it until life eternal and lord jesus christ there's nothing that we could gain in this world that would be worth it if we were to lose our soul father i pray lord god that you'll speak conviction into the heart of the hearer lord that they'll hunger and thirst and that they will see that the when the spirit of jesus christ is in them that they want to have a kindness to people that are unthankful lord god when i think of you lord god the night lord before your betrayal and judas iscariot himself is there in the upper room and you got down on your hands and knees and you washed the feet of the son of perdition the very one who the next day was gonna go out and betray you lord but you humbled yourself and you washed his feet father god oh lord jesus christ and then i think father about the spirit lord god that dwells in me and i just ask myself father would i be able to wash the feet of somebody that i knew was going to betray me to such a hateful death but lord god if indeed it is your spirit that dwells in me then lord not i as paul said i'm crucified with christ i'm crucified with christ yet i live enough in the life that i now live i live by the faith of the son of god lord help us as your children to have perfect faith in perfect love and understand that the tender hand of jehovah is leading us to the promised land and any heartaches that we come and and have to withstand along the way lord god it's just you working something together for our good help us lord god take these broken up words and lord what the word that's preached is supposed to do is to build the faith of the saints because faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word lord jesus i pray father i pray that you'll build up the most holy faith of those that have heard this word tonight lord we present it lord to you lord and that you'll take anything that was said that was that was misquoted and lord just straighten it up father like the little boy father didn't know how to pray so he was just saying his abcs lord we throw it up to you father and we believe lord god that you'll take the intention of our heart and you'll put it all together and lord god what will come out of this service is there'll be people who have deeper love uh richer a joy more peace lord peace that passes all understanding that they'll know the love of god the heights and the depths and the lengths and the breadth and to know the love of god that passes knowledge lord and that we all might be filled with all the fullness of god we commit this church and our way unto you in jesus name amen [Applause] to amen the message tonight blessed be the name of the lord the tender hand of jehovah do you really know what it means it's really the trials and the tribulation and the persecution but it depends on who you are that's all if you're a child of god all things work together for good all things brother brad i'm saying if not god will be an author of frustration and not an author of love amen so there is nothing that can come in your life that god have no measure amen god looked at your level and he said she is on level five then he look at the child if the trial is eight god decrees it so you go 4.9 amen so you are above the trial amen so when the trial comes you just don't know who you are that's the problem amen that's the problem there is no better children god could have given you than the children he gave you did you get me did you get me god could not give you my children god knows what he put in you and he knew that you can handle these kind of children amen and we get discouraged because we don't understand who we are amen if you understand that these kids belong to me this is the best that god saw in heaven to give it to me so there is nothing that this child cannot can do that i cannot handle all this child is out of control no you let it go under out of control amen if you take your token as a parent and you go before god not as anybody as the parent of that child amen god will remember you he will recognize that you're the one that gave that child if you just understand and you go deep before god coming boldly unto melchizedek that high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities you will see what god will do to that child amen amen if it's a prodigal son god will reach out all the way there god let him spend all the money and put him all the way to the pig pen who preached him the gospel in the pig pen can a pig preach the gospel who preached him did they say a preacher went there to preach him the gospel no he himself came to himself why he didn't come to him to himself all this time amen because daddy was waiting right there amen when he was coming daddy was not in the house who told daddy he was coming amen amen that's why you heard moses saying to pharaoh not even a hoof amen the hoof moses didn't birth a hoof but what moses is telling pharaoh is if he gave me this hoof i'm not going to leave this in egypt so whatever god gave me i would go out with it amen so never give up on a child never never never never never give up on a child oh my child i cannot control no look at yourself there is something in you if you turn it on you're going to control that child amen you just don't understand who you are or you have been compromising somewhere amen but if you line up yourself with the north star you line up with the word automatically certain things will be taking care of themselves amen the trials that god brings in your life is not to destroy you god is just trying to bring you closer if god preaches something hard that hurts you he just want to get that devil off of you amen amen amen because god doesn't want you to be in the world that's all he just loves you so much more than you can even think because the love of god we can never comprehend it amen amen you say the love of god the bible says that who gives you the love of god it's in roman father the love of god is shared in your heart by the holy ghost that's why you need to get the holy ghost and automatically the love of god comes to you you don't have to force anything you're forcing things because there is a step you are in you're not somewhere that's why you're forcing things the day you're going to drop in that level that we're talking about you will see that's it's a neutral level you don't do anything anymore god will take care of of everything amen somebody will say something and you feel the black dog begin to move and suddenly somebody shut the black dog down and you feel like you know what just let him go and you don't know where he came from and you turn around you say that was me yes it's you but it's not really you it's christ that i live in you it's the crust that he got amen amen so stay closer to the word god knows exactly what he's doing don't get discouraged no matter what is happening no wonder what comes out in your life god have everything under control all things in your life will work together for good amen amen any questions so far do you love the message of the hour amen amen i don't know why people keep bordering themselves about brother brother i'm brother brother no brother brother brother either you believe brother brother no more just leave him alone [Music] right amen amen it's the word of god the problem is the gentile never was trained for prophet that's where we got the problem the jews knew what a prophet is the samaritan knew what a prophet is that's why when the woman at the well met jesus christ even being a prostitute yet she can recognize a prophet because they were trained on the prophet but the gentile do not understand prophet if you bring him a prophet first of all it's it's like something spooky why is this man coming up with things like this what's wrong what's wrong look at this look at this because we were not trained to profit amen that's why the ministry of brother brandon is very hard for people to understand you remember the quote i gave you last time where brother branham said that's why you're having a hard time you don't know how to separate me from him i am just standing there he's the one doing these things amen amen it's a different ministry if you don't understand that you're going to go left and right left and right left and right and you hear people but when i'm saying this but what i'm saying you're just wasting your time the prophet look at the way the bible is written and you're going to understand the ministry of a prophet amen amen amen was moses saying that saith the lord all the time was he saying that saved the lord all the time can you remove the word of moses that was not that saved the lord from the bible [Music] say what you see now you see now brother branham say if the bible was a book of a man they would have hide the error of the jews but put it there so that god is showing you that abraham lied but that abraham lied you want to chew it do you want to chew it it's the word of god amen but it's showing you something that abraham did and how grace is coming over to rescue abraham but it's still the word of god amen amen that's why when james comes and he say those men were the men of like passion like us you begin to understand what like passion means means there was a time brother branham run and told his wife tell them i'm not there they put it in the in the in the tape so you remember it's there so when you're going through trial something would knock this will happen to brother branham i see now i'm not gonna lie then you go around they use somebody else to bring you a stepping stone so you jump out that's how the prophets are in the scripture that's why you see david doing something wrong you don't understand because somebody down the road will do something wrong and they will go back to david and look and say if he did this to david how can you get a prisoner in the jail to preach the gospel show him moses kill somebody and moses preached the gospel then the prisoner rose up he said i killed somebody the lord can forgive me he he can go outside and preach the gospel because god used moses who killed somebody you see now amen that's a prophetic world he goes like that god put everything there he knows what he's putting there if he hides then we found out did you find no brother brother was not hiding anything brother brother was not hiding everything he put everything up there he told you what he did he told you he told the lawyer he told you how he repented to the lawyer it's clear what else do you want to show me this ministry is the ministry of christ amen the more i get in the message the more i love my bible the more i lo i read my bible and the message put me more in the bible than anything else so i don't see how the message can take you off the bible so you got the wrong message oh let's go back to the bible where were you the message was putting us back to the bible where were you the message was sending us back to the bible we've been going to the nomination doing crazy things somebody came and said look in the bible look in the scripture look in first corinthians this is not the evidence of the holy ghost look at the word of baptism look at this back back to the bible amen who can point you to the bible like that when they challenged brother branham did he bring any any brochure what did he put on the pulpit he just took the bible like this he put it up like this he said you come touch this bubble and challenge me he didn't put a tape he put the bible to tell you that what i'm bringing was not coming outside of this word he was coming here take this word and disprove me that i'm wrong i was only pointing you to jesus christ until when you read the bible you look at the tabernacle you look at this you see jesus christ everywhere amen and you get so close to jesus christ until you know we now go at the rapture what did john do in revelation 10 when he got the book he did what he ate the book amen when we go to the when i'm gonna be taken out of the rapture this bible here will stay you don't believe it when i'm going in the rapture this bible will stay amen but what is going in the rapture if me is the living bible the tape will stay but the tape that was in me will go with me in the rapture amen so the message is a person it comes into you it's a person when they take you off they're taking you it's not like we're gonna take the bible and start eating the bible that's not wait men shall not live by every word faith cometh by what what brother hearing hearing what the word of god when he get into the word it's no more a page it is a life now it is no more a coat of perfect love by the time it is perfect love in life where is the wealth revival did they point up to somebody he said i am the wealthy verb where is the message of the year oh you need the the message of the hour i am the message of the house amen i am the message of the hour amen stay with me leave with me you're going to ask me a question why do you behave like this because i am the message of the hour amen amen oh my god it gets so rich and so good don't be discouraged no matter what is going on god is working in your life he looks cruel sometimes he looks hard it is just the tender hand of jehovah everything that you're going through you got the power to overcome it
