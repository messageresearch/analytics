[0:00] persist and have faith in God. Little
[0:02] Micah in the presence of all them 400
[0:05] trained prophets were persistent when he
[0:07] had a vision from God. Though they he
[0:09] was contrary, they met him and told him,
[0:11] "Now we'll put you back in the
[0:12] association if you say the same thing
[0:14] you they say." He said, "As the Lord
[0:16] lives, I'll only say what he tells me to
[0:18] say." And his vision was examined with
[0:21] the word of God. And he pronounced this
[0:23] prophecy no matter what. They said with
[0:25] throw him into the inner cells and give
[0:26] him sorrow, bread of sorrow and waters
[0:29] of sorrow. And when they come back, he
[0:31] said he'd deal with you. Ahab did. He
[0:33] said, "If you come back at all, God
[0:34] hasn't spoke to me." He was persistent.
[0:37] He knew where he was standing. The blind
[0:39] man that had been healed by Jesus could
[0:40] not argue their theology. They said,
[0:43] "Who opens your
[0:44] eyes?" He said, "A man called Jesus of
[0:47] Nazareth." He said, "This man's a
[0:49] sinner. We know which he come from. Now
[0:52] he gave them a good answer. He said,
[0:54] "You are the religious leaders of this
[0:56] day. And this man has given me my sight
[0:58] and yet you don't know where he come
[1:00] from." He had a pretty good theology of
[1:02] his own. He could not argue with them,
[1:04] but he knowed one thing. He could see
[1:06] and he wasn't ashamed. His father and
[1:08] mother was ashamed to say something
[1:09] about it, but not him.
[1:12] He had seen it. He had felt it. He had
[1:14] the results of it. Something had told
[1:16] him, and he was persistent. Philip as
[1:20] soon as he seen last night's lesson what
[1:22] that when come up in the presence of
[1:24] Jesus Christ when he saw Simon's son or
[1:28] Andrew's f um brother Phil Peter come up
[1:32] in the presence which was Simon then
[1:33] come in the presence of Jesus Simon had
[1:35] been taught as a child that Messiah
[1:37] would be a prophet when he walked into
[1:39] his presence and he told him your name
[1:41] is Simon and you are the son of Jonas he
[1:46] was persistent he was ready then become
[1:48] the head of the church. When Philip saw
[1:50] it, he knowed another good Bible reader
[1:52] that knowed the truth. He was
[1:54] persistent. He went around the mountain
[1:55] and got him. And when Nathaniel come, a
[1:58] man of renown, a real Hebrew indeed, a
[2:02] man staunched Hebrew, real fine man,
[2:06] fine integrity. He was a great man. But
[2:08] in the presence of his priest and
[2:10] presence of every one of them, when
[2:12] Jesus looked upon him and said, "Behold,
[2:14] an Israelite in whom there's no God," he
[2:16] said, "Rabbi, how did you know me? I've
[2:18] never seen you before. How did you know
[2:20] who I was?" He said, "Before Philip
[2:22] called you, when you were under the
[2:23] tree, I saw you." He fell at his feet
[2:26] and said, "Thou art the Christ, the son
[2:28] of the living God. Thou art the king of
[2:30] Israel." Why? He was persistent
[2:33] regardless what anybody else thought. He
[2:35] had met the thing he had read about.
[2:37] What he had expected to find in Jesus.
[2:40] He had found a little prostitute woman
[2:42] come out the well one day to get water.
[2:44] There said Jesus, an ordinary man
[2:45] dressed in ordinary clothes, eating
[2:47] ordinary food, talking ordinary
[2:49] language. Just common street language
[2:51] like anyone else talking. And she spoke
[2:53] to him. He spoke to her. He found where
[2:56] her fault was. He said, "Go get your
[2:58] husband and come here." She said, "I
[2:59] have no husband." Said, "You said 12.
[3:02] We've had five and the one you're living
[3:03] with now is not yours. quickly. That
[3:06] predestinated seed in her heart struck
[3:08] life. When it has struck the Pharisees,
[3:10] it just turned the whole thing black.
[3:12] They said, "This man's beubb. He's a
[3:14] fortune teller." But she knew the word
[3:17] was sharper, more powerful than a
[3:18] two-edged sword and a desert of the
[3:20] thoughts of the heart. She said, "Sir,
[3:22] what
[3:28] [Music]
[7:55] [Music]

[8:10] you. Amen. Praise God. Can we be

[35:24] Amen.
[35:26] Amen. Amen.
[35:42] God bless you, saints.
[35:45] Forgive me. I'm so tired.
[35:48] Um, but I did want to give this quick
[35:50] testimony. Um, just to I guess encourage
[35:54] somebody or
[35:56] um I don't know. I guess God knows. But
[36:00] um so it's a small testimony. Um this I
[36:03] think it was Mother's Day weekend or
[36:06] Mother's Day week. Um I'm currently new
[36:08] at this school that I'm working. Um and
[36:12] so the same week of Mother's Day was
[36:14] also teach teacher appreciation week. Um
[36:17] but I haven't worked there enough. So I
[36:18] didn't expect like gifts, you know, from
[36:20] parents and stuff like that. I was only
[36:22] there for like a month. But I saw that,
[36:24] you know, all the little ones, you know,
[36:25] like they loved me. So I knew something
[36:27] was coming. But um so that same week we
[36:31] had to do like a um a gift for the
[36:33] mothers since Mother's Day was coming up
[36:35] that same um Sunday. And like we were
[36:38] missing a supply in the school. So I was
[36:41] just thinking, okay, maybe because
[36:43] because you know we're missing the
[36:44] supplies, let me just maybe run to
[36:46] Walmart during break and just grab the
[36:47] supply. But at the same time, I was kind
[36:49] of like fighting myself. I'm like I feel
[36:50] like if I buy the supply for the school,
[36:53] it's going to kind of be like a habit
[36:55] type of thing. And I was like I was like
[36:56] the supply was only like $8, but I'm
[36:58] like should I just I was like I it just
[37:00] didn't feel right for me to buy the
[37:01] supply and then bring it back to the
[37:02] principal and be like hey I bought this
[37:03] for the students for I was like let me
[37:05] just I was like guys guys guys are
[37:07] gentlemen it's it's it's just $8. You
[37:09] know I'm not going to worry too much
[37:10] about
[37:11] it. But um in the same time you know
[37:14] after I got the supplies I was just know
[37:15] looking at house stuff because you know
[37:17] we're renovating our house. So I was
[37:18] just, you know, walking around and then
[37:20] later on I came back to the school and
[37:23] then that same day um it was a Friday. I
[37:25] remember um one of the parents um gifted
[37:28] me um the same a Walmart gift card. So
[37:32] the things was like $8, but the Walmart
[37:33] gift card that she gifted me was $75
[37:36] Walmart gift card. And I was just like,
[37:37] "Oh my goodness, look at God." Like I
[37:39] just literally just spent $8. I didn't
[37:41] really I just knew in my spirit God was
[37:43] just like, "Just do it. Just do it." And
[37:45] I was kind of like fighting myself. I
[37:46] was like, "You don't really have to do
[37:47] it. They got money in the school, you
[37:48] know." But um but I just wanted to give
[37:51] that to us just just to show how
[37:53] sometimes God is such a gentleman and
[37:54] sometimes it's so important for us just
[37:56] for us just to do the right thing, you
[37:58] know, and God's going to pay us back.
[38:01] Amen.
[38:03] Amen.
[38:05] Amen. Amen. Brother Micah has a
[38:07] testimony. Amen. Brother Micah daily.
[38:10] Then after that, Brother Michael pray.
[38:12] Amen. Thank the Lord.
[38:15] Amen.
[38:16] Uh he's real, isn't he? He's a on time
[38:20] god.
[38:22] It says, "I will declare his name in the
[38:24] in the congregation of the gods." That's
[38:27] what the psalm said. Well, um Monday I I
[38:31] picked up my load and um I stopped at
[38:33] the fuel stop, got me a coffee and a
[38:36] donut or whatever, told my wife and
[38:39] um uh paid for it and I got to my
[38:43] destination which was in Grier and I got
[38:46] out the truck and I unstrapped my load
[38:48] and getting ready and I put my hand like
[38:50] this and I always carry my my wallet in
[38:53] whichever pocket I pants I have right
[38:56] here. So I touched myself and no wallet.
[39:00] So you know you got all your pertinent
[39:02] things in the wallet and I says but you
[39:04] know when you put God first
[39:07] I think God wants us to put him first.
[39:10] So without thinking of anything I said
[39:12] Lord let me find my wallet. So I looked
[39:16] in the truck and I don't see it in the
[39:18] truck and I I looked outside on the
[39:20] floor and I said well well that was the
[39:21] last place I had it and I got into the
[39:23] truck so where could it be? So I called
[39:26] my wife and said, "Look like the the
[39:28] wallet fell out my pocket." Which it
[39:30] did. So I was coming out the truck again
[39:32] and I looked down and it fell right into
[39:35] the pocket of the door. So I just want
[39:37] to give him praise. It could have fell
[39:38] out anywhere else, you know. So I give
[39:40] him praise. Amen. And amen. Amen. Amen.
[39:43] We just bless the Lord for this
[39:45] testimony. Amen. And and just to add a
[39:48] little testimony is not a little one,
[39:50] but while on our way coming, my my wife
[39:52] was feeling some pressure in her head.
[39:55] Amen. And she just said, "I rebuke
[39:57] this." And instantly it just went off
[39:59] like it was magic. So we just want to
[40:02] thank the Lord. Amen. Amen. So, Brother
[40:05] Michael March.
[40:07] Amen. Amen. After that, we have Sister
[40:12] Lely, Sister Yok. Amen. Invite the
[40:16] minister to pop. Amen.
[40:19] God bless you. Amen.
[40:22] Happy. Yes. All right. Amen. This is the
[40:26] best place to be.
[40:28] Yeah. To be happy.
[40:31] And there's a little song which is
[40:33] saying that if you're happy and you know
[40:36] Yeah. Please show it.
[40:41] Okay. All
[40:44] right.

[42:20] testimony. There's a preacher who said
[42:23] God cares about our little things. Oh
[42:26] God, that really encouraged me one time,
[42:28] Father, because we can rely on you on
[42:32] small things and on big things, oh God.
[42:36] Lord, there are many needs in in the
[42:39] hearts of your children here. Lord, take
[42:42] care of it. Those who are here and those
[42:44] who are online, oh father, bless us now
[42:47] as we prepare to
[42:49] receive the preacher, Father, may you
[42:51] prepare him, oh God, take him out of the
[42:54] way as you have always done, oh Father,
[42:56] and may you speak to us, Father. Father,
[42:59] take take the tithes and and offerings,
[43:02] oh God. May we use them for the benefit
[43:05] of the gospel. Father, at the end of the
[43:07] day, and the end of this evening, let us
[43:10] go home ready to serve you again, oh
[43:13] God. Thank you, Lord Jesus. In Jesus

[56:20] messaged brother said that I wanted to
[56:22] sing this song. Uh he told me to make a
[56:24] recording for the key. So, I was in the
[56:27] car driving on the way home and I
[56:30] started singing and I'm rejoicing and
[56:31] singing and I'm coming onto the 85 and
[56:35] there are two vehicles in front of me
[56:36] and they're merging but they came to an
[56:38] abrupt stop and right as I said the time
[56:40] of my life is over. I was about to ram
[56:43] straight into the back of a car. I say a
[56:47] devil. And brother Stephen, I said,
[56:50] "Lord, I know I'm rejoicing and I'm
[56:52] singing this song, but if my life was
[56:54] over at this moment, I knew exactly
[56:56] where I was going. But I just want to
[56:58] say thank God for sparing my life
[57:01] today."
[57:07] And remember one thing, no devil can
[57:10] take you until the purpose of God is
[57:14] fulfilled in your
[57:17] life. Amen. Brother John, do you have a

[58:07] when I preach, I have to sit home and
[58:09] listen to the whole sermon over again.
[58:11] When I begin to listen to the whole

[59:38] altar. Then under the altar then we go
[59:40] back again and begin to get the book of
[59:42] remembrance. After the book of
[59:44] remembrance we keep climbing until we
[59:47] come out of pifa house then we move down
[59:50] there. So there is a traffic on the
[59:54] road. It's this word is so I don't know
[59:58] this message is something. Amen. Amen.
[1:00:03] Just just people talking messages are
[1:00:05] breaking up. Brother Michael was saying
[1:00:07] something. He didn't know even what he's
[1:00:08] saying. B. And you saw me tapping over
[1:00:10] there because when he comes I have to
[1:00:12] tap it quickly so that I can go home and
[1:00:14] pull the quote. He's reminding me a
[1:00:16] quote or something. He didn't even know
[1:00:17] what he's saying. So God is with us.
[1:00:23] God is with us. It's unbelievable, but
[1:00:26] God is with us. Thank you very much
[1:00:28] everybody that could make it to the
[1:00:30] funeral of Sister Pam. God richly bless
[1:00:33] you. All the support from the food, from
[1:00:35] the phone call, your presence being
[1:00:37] there. I know some could not make it on
[1:00:40] Monday, but I know throughout the week
[1:00:42] you were there on Sunday, on Saturday.
[1:00:44] Whatever you did for our sister, it
[1:00:46] showed really that we are a true family.
[1:00:49] We are together and God richly bless you
[1:00:52] and sister Pam, God bless you and
[1:00:54] continue to comfort you. But I know one
[1:00:56] thing,
[1:00:58] that man is in the right place.
[1:01:07] And I believe God pull to give you a
[1:01:10] peace that Sunday. Amen. But God knows
[1:01:12] exactly that man is in the right place

[1:01:17] when we exhort a little bit on Sunday
[1:01:20] for those that were there God that boy
[1:01:22] is in peace. So God knew exactly his
[1:01:24] purpose was finished and and I said
[1:01:27] sister Pam he say that was a real father
[1:01:30] and brother Brandham say a father is one
[1:01:32] of God's purpose. He fulfilled it. He
[1:01:36] went home, fixed everything and straight
[1:01:39] into the arm of the master. You are
[1:01:41] sure, guarantee you're going to see him.
[1:01:44] Amen. This is what we want. So, we greet
[1:01:47] you all in the precious name of our Lord
[1:01:49] and Savior Jesus Christ. Both visible
[1:01:53] and invisible audience continue to pray
[1:01:55] for her because usually when everybody's
[1:01:57] gone, you get you begin to get lonely.
[1:01:59] That's when things and thoughts and
[1:02:01] memories begin to come. But God know
[1:02:03] exactly that sister Pam can take it and
[1:02:06] God will give her the appropriate
[1:02:07] strength for it. Amen. Any family member
[1:02:10] here, God richly bless you and welcome
[1:02:12] to our convention tonight. And I believe
[1:02:15] we clear with Mama Zebedee now,

[1:02:24] and God open up other things that she
[1:02:27] was not away and guarantee her children
[1:02:30] to receive the Holy Spirit. Amen.

[1:06:16] choice but to believe.
[1:06:20] That's all we know how to do is believe.
[1:06:24] And and and they say this, they say
[1:06:27] that, but we we believe because we know
[1:06:29] what God says. And this this song has
[1:06:32] been on my heart because and I heard
[1:06:36] testimony after testimony and the world
[1:06:39] don't they don't know what we're
[1:06:41] experiencing here as a believer and they
[1:06:44] can only go off a man's word you know
[1:06:47] whatever a man says and and and that's
[1:06:49] why they always have that talk they say
[1:06:52] but we say God say and and we believe in
[1:06:55] every word that that he says
[1:06:59] so y'all I'm just going to sing a little
[1:07:00] bit of this song if you want to stand
[1:07:02] you can if you if you want to see it

[1:07:23] tonight.
[1:07:24] [Music]
[1:07:26] And the song
[1:07:30] says, "They say this mountain can be
[1:07:37] moved. They say these chains will never
[1:07:44] break. But they don't know you like we

[1:15:17] to take care of some things on that end,
[1:15:18] and they wanted to be here tonight,
[1:15:20] but you know, they they're online in

[1:15:34] Let's go to the word.
[1:15:39] Um, you know, sometimes I I like I say,
[1:15:42] I fight back through song. You know, you
[1:15:45] have to you have to use whatever you can
[1:15:48] use. And and and
[1:15:50] and when when you when you find out what
[1:15:53] works,
[1:15:54] [Applause]
[1:15:55] you stay right there.
[1:15:58] You stay right there.
[1:16:01] And and you know, everybody has a gift.
[1:16:04] And and and some people have a gift of
[1:16:06] praying. Some people have a gift for
[1:16:07] singing or playing music, but whatever
[1:16:10] you find what works.
[1:16:13] You stay right there.
[1:16:15] Stay right there.
[1:16:17] Yes, sir.
[1:16:24] For the book of Matthew,
[1:16:27] chapter 22:14.
[1:16:30] And I I tried to move on from this, but
[1:16:33] the Holy Spirit say, "Stay right there.
[1:16:36] Stay right there. So, he got he got more
[1:16:38] he want to say. Um, and the scripture
[1:16:42] says, "For many are called, but few are
[1:16:45] chosen." And if you don't mind, go to
[1:16:48] the book of
[1:16:49] Matthew, the 11th
[1:16:54] chapter, verse 28. We're going to start
[1:16:57] at verse 28. Amen.
[1:17:01] And it reads, "Come unto me
[1:17:04] all ye that labor
[1:17:07] and are heavy laden, and I will give you
[1:17:10] rest." That's right. And he says, "Take
[1:17:13] my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I
[1:17:17] am meek and lowly in heart, and you
[1:17:20] shall find rest unto your souls." That's
[1:17:24] right. Verse 30 say, "For my yoke is
[1:17:26] easy and my burden is light." Amen. Let
[1:17:30] us pray. Dear heavenly father, oh God,
[1:17:33] we have did what you asked us to do, oh
[1:17:36] God, we have assembled ourselves
[1:17:38] together, oh God, in believing and
[1:17:41] touching and agreeing, oh father, that
[1:17:43] the Holy Spirit in the midst, oh God,
[1:17:44] will come down and speak to us tonight,
[1:17:46] oh Father. Lord God, we depending on you
[1:17:48] tonight, oh God, and we're leaning on
[1:17:50] you, God, for all understanding, oh God,
[1:17:52] for your knowledge and your wisdom, oh
[1:17:54] Father, we pray that you will move me
[1:17:56] out of the way, oh God, and open up the
[1:17:58] scriptures, oh God, oh God, and speak to
[1:18:00] your bride, oh God, tonight, oh father,
[1:18:02] in the mighty name of Jesus Christ, we
[1:18:04] pray. Amen.
[1:18:06] You don't mind, you can be
[1:18:10] seated. So my title tonight, of course,
[1:18:13] would be the chosen ones, part three.
[1:18:17] And we will be we will be dealing with
[1:18:18] favor
[1:18:20] and the promise of rest in the Holy
[1:18:23] Ghost.
[1:18:26] Favor and the promise of rest in the
[1:18:29] Holy Ghost.
[1:18:31] If you go back to the book of Genesis in
[1:18:33] the beginning, you know, where
[1:18:36] everything was at peace and and we was
[1:18:38] at rest, you know, Adam didn't have to
[1:18:42] do anything. You know, he he all he had
[1:18:44] to do was just rest, right? and and and
[1:18:46] God God would even when it came down to
[1:18:48] naming the animals or whatnot, God
[1:18:51] brought them to him. If you read the
[1:18:53] scripture, God brought them to him. So,
[1:18:55] Adam didn't even have to do anything but
[1:18:56] rest. And and when he made Eve, he
[1:19:00] brought Eve to him.
[1:19:03] Adam was in a resting state. That's
[1:19:05] right. And and he and and and that's
[1:19:09] what I want to deal with tonight is is
[1:19:11] is favor with God.
[1:19:14] and that promised rest that he promised
[1:19:16] us.
[1:19:18] So if we possess the Holy Ghost
[1:19:22] and we know that the Holy Ghost is
[1:19:25] eternal
[1:19:26] and and and brother Brenham was talking
[1:19:29] about in the let me go ahead and read
[1:19:31] this this quote. This is this is a quote
[1:19:34] I've been reading and I've been holding
[1:19:36] on to this one and it question and
[1:19:38] answering page 123. He said before there
[1:19:41] was a world you were in God's thoughts
[1:19:46] to give you the Holy Ghost
[1:19:49] because he knew that you be wanting it.
[1:19:53] So the reason that you are wanting the
[1:19:55] Holy Ghost tonight brother because
[1:19:58] that's where you come from.
[1:20:01] You came from God. You go back to God.
[1:20:03] So that desire to receive the Holy Ghost
[1:20:06] is nothing but the attributes of where
[1:20:07] you came from.
[1:20:09] So you you came from God, so you have no
[1:20:12] choice but to want and desire that Holy
[1:20:15] Ghost.
[1:20:17] And he says he knew that you would be
[1:20:20] wanting it. And he chose you himself
[1:20:23] before you desired. That's right. Amen.
[1:20:26] So right there, I'm finding out that we
[1:20:28] already had favor with God.
[1:20:31] So So fa favor is not something that I
[1:20:34] developed when I got here. Come on. Come
[1:20:37] on. The Holy Ghost is not a gift that I
[1:20:39] had to work for when I got here. It was
[1:20:41] I was already entitled to that cuz
[1:20:44] that's where I came from. I already had
[1:20:45] the Holy Ghost. I already had favor with
[1:20:48] God. I already had joy. I already had
[1:20:51] peace. I already had happiness. So, I
[1:20:55] already had rest. I was already in a
[1:20:58] resting place from the foundation of the
[1:21:00] world. And that's what I want you to get
[1:21:02] to understand tonight. You and I were
[1:21:05] already resting before the foundation of
[1:21:08] the world.
[1:21:11] And he says, "Yes, my brother." And he
[1:21:14] sent Jesus to die to prepare the way
[1:21:17] That's right. to send the Holy Ghost. To
[1:21:20] bring you to himself. H Oh, that just I
[1:21:23] know this is the church, he says. So,
[1:21:25] I'm at home now. You see, oh, that is so
[1:21:28] rich to me to think it's not what I
[1:21:30] wanted. It It wasn't my desire. It
[1:21:33] wasn't my will. It wasn't my choosing. I
[1:21:36] had not one thing to do with it. He
[1:21:38] said, "But before the world ever
[1:21:39] started, God saw us and he put our name
[1:21:42] on the lamb's book of life. Before there
[1:21:44] even was a world talk about God."
[1:21:48] So my my my problem is tonight, why
[1:21:52] aren't we resting?
[1:21:53] [Applause]
[1:21:55] Why are Christians, we true believers of
[1:21:58] God, why are we not resting? Amen. We
[1:22:01] come from rest.
[1:22:03] Rest is already inside of us. And why
[1:22:06] why we're not rested tonight as true
[1:22:07] believers? There should be not nothing
[1:22:09] going on in this world that should pull
[1:22:11] us out of that rest. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:22:16] Glory to God. In the message, God keeps
[1:22:19] his word.
[1:22:21] Yes, sir. No, I'm sorry. Let's Let's
[1:22:23] move up a little bit. In the message,
[1:22:25] what was the Holy Ghost given for?
[1:22:28] What was the Holy Ghost given for? 1959
[1:22:31] paragraph 139 and brother Brennan says
[1:22:35] and then again he says you may be full
[1:22:38] of the Holy Ghost. Amen. He said I hope
[1:22:42] you are. He said if you're not I hope
[1:22:46] you get full. And he says and if you're
[1:22:49] full of the Holy Ghost and he asked a
[1:22:52] question what you got? He says you got
[1:22:54] power.
[1:22:56] You got love.
[1:22:58] You got peace. That's right. He said,
[1:23:00] "My peace I give unto you." Not as the
[1:23:03] world giveth thy you. He says, "You got
[1:23:05] peace. You are sealed. You got a sign."
[1:23:09] Amen. He says, "You got rest." He say
[1:23:12] you got joy. That's right. Unspeakable
[1:23:15] and full of glory. That's right. He said
[1:23:17] you are anchored. Then he says, "Oh my,
[1:23:20] that's what you are with the Holy Ghost.
[1:23:24] If you got full of the Holy Ghost, you
[1:23:25] have passed from death unto life,
[1:23:28] waiting for the general resurrection in
[1:23:30] the last day. So why we're not resting.
[1:23:35] And in the message, God keeps his word.
[1:23:38] 1957, paragraph 213. Yes, sir. He says,
[1:23:42] that's the word of God. He said, dare I
[1:23:45] rest. He said, "Not on whether I jumped
[1:23:49] or whether I shouted, whether I spoke
[1:23:51] with tongues, whether I had the oil in
[1:23:54] my hands or whether I preached or what I
[1:23:57] doing." He said, "I'm resting on that
[1:24:00] promise."
[1:24:02] He said, "Satan can beat me around the
[1:24:04] stump on my feelings." He said, "But he
[1:24:07] but he can't." He said, "But he can't on
[1:24:10] the word cuz it's thus said the Lord."
[1:24:13] That's where Jesus defeated the devil
[1:24:15] right there. He said, "It is written,
[1:24:17] man should not live by bread alone." He
[1:24:20] said, "Stay with the word." That's
[1:24:22] right. And and and I and I was thinking
[1:24:24] about how how it's so easy for us to
[1:24:26] take a man's word. Right. And and and I
[1:24:30] get and if I was to ask each one of
[1:24:31] y'all tonight, you you could probably
[1:24:33] name one or two people that you believe
[1:24:35] in that that if they came to you and
[1:24:38] told you they going to do something, you
[1:24:40] would go to sleep sleeping good cuz you
[1:24:43] you had developed a relationship with
[1:24:44] that person and you know this person
[1:24:46] never lied to you and and and you got
[1:24:49] trust in his words. The only thing you
[1:24:51] can trust is his words for the next time
[1:24:53] that he going to do what he say he going
[1:24:55] to do. So my my thing is we can take a
[1:24:58] man's word and rest off of it. What
[1:25:00] about the word of God? What about the
[1:25:03] words that are written in this book
[1:25:04] right here? We should be resting on
[1:25:06] every promise in the book. We should be
[1:25:08] resting on every word in the book. Why?
[1:25:10] Because God said it. And that should put
[1:25:12] us in the rest and we should be at
[1:25:14] peace.
[1:25:18] Amen. Amen.
[1:25:20] Turn to Psalms 55. Yes, sir. That's it.
[1:25:23] Psalms 55.
[1:25:25] verse
[1:25:28] 22 and you get it. Just say amen. Amen.
[1:25:32] Psalms 55 verse 22.
[1:25:38] And the scripture says in Psalms Uhhuh.
[1:25:41] it said,
[1:25:42] "Cast thy burden upon the Lord." That's
[1:25:45] right. And he shall sustain thee. He
[1:25:49] shall never suffer the righteous to be
[1:25:51] moved.
[1:25:54] Now that first word said cast
[1:25:58] that mean to give him your burdens.
[1:26:01] And and I'm a victim of that and and uh
[1:26:04] we find ourselves sometimes praying and
[1:26:06] and you know we we got a PhD with
[1:26:09] telling God what's going on. You know we
[1:26:12] got a PhD with with all the details.
[1:26:14] Lord this is going on from A to Z. But
[1:26:17] the fatal mistake that we make we get up
[1:26:19] and take the burden back with us.
[1:26:22] We take the burden back with us and the
[1:26:23] word say you're supposed to cast your
[1:26:25] burdens unto God. So that mean all your
[1:26:28] problems, all your fault, you need to
[1:26:29] leave them there with him. So that
[1:26:32] allows you to enter into that rest when
[1:26:35] you leave your burdens with God.
[1:26:38] [Applause]
[1:26:40] And and and let's go to the book of John
[1:26:43] chapter 14. Yes, my brother verse 26.
[1:26:50] St. John 14 26. Yes sir.
[1:26:55] And he says, "But the comforter, yes
[1:26:58] sir, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the
[1:27:01] father will send in my name, he shall
[1:27:05] teach you all things."
[1:27:08] Why we Why do we worry?
[1:27:12] He said, "The Holy Ghost is able to
[1:27:14] teach you all things." Amen. So we don't
[1:27:18] have to worry about these things.
[1:27:20] And then then he said, "And it brings
[1:27:22] all things to your remembrance." That's
[1:27:24] right. So So it even going bring to your
[1:27:28] remembrance even the things that you
[1:27:29] forgotten. That's it. That's it. So So
[1:27:31] whatever God has told you and and you
[1:27:34] know what he said later on down the
[1:27:36] road, if you forget, the Holy Ghost is
[1:27:38] going to remind you when when you get in
[1:27:40] that test or that trial, he gonna pop up
[1:27:42] and remind you. So So we should be
[1:27:45] resting.
[1:27:46] [Music]
[1:27:48] He said, "It will bring all things to
[1:27:50] your remembrance whatsoever I have said
[1:27:53] unto you." And let's go back to the book
[1:27:56] of Psalms, chapter 139.
[1:27:59] Amen.
[1:28:02] Book of Psalms, chapter 139, verse one.
[1:28:07] Yes sir. The book of Psalms, the first
[1:28:09] verse, chapter 13. Now, it says, "Oh
[1:28:12] Lord, thou has searched me.
[1:28:16] and known me. That's right. Say, "Thou
[1:28:19] knowest my down city and my uprising."
[1:28:23] Say, "Thou understandest my thoughts are
[1:28:26] far off."
[1:28:28] Say, "Thou compasseth my path and my
[1:28:31] lying down, and are acquainted with all
[1:28:34] my ways,
[1:28:36] for thou for there is not a word in my
[1:28:39] tongue. But lo, oh Lord, thou knowest it
[1:28:43] all together.
[1:28:44] Thou hast besat me behind and before and
[1:28:48] laid thy hand upon me. And he say such
[1:28:51] knowledge is too wonderful for me. It is
[1:28:54] high. I cannot attain unto it. Say
[1:28:58] whether shall I go from thy spirit or
[1:29:01] whether shall I flee from thy presence?
[1:29:04] If I ascend into heaven, thou art there.
[1:29:08] He said, if I make my bed in hell,
[1:29:11] behold, thou art there. See, David got
[1:29:14] to a point where if if I had to make my
[1:29:16] bed in hell, I still will be resting.
[1:29:18] Yes, sir. I will still find rest in the
[1:29:21] midst of hell. And that's what David is
[1:29:24] saying. And you as a believer or not,
[1:29:25] you got to find rest in the in the midst
[1:29:28] of your trials. You got to find rest in
[1:29:30] the midst of your testes. It don't
[1:29:32] matter what's going on, you got to find
[1:29:34] a place of rest.
[1:29:37] Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:29:39] And verse 9 say, "If I take the wings of
[1:29:41] the morning and dwell in the uttermost
[1:29:44] parts of the sea." He said, "Even there
[1:29:46] shall thy hand lead me and thy right
[1:29:49] hand shall hold me." He said, "If I say,
[1:29:52] surely the darkness shall cover me, even
[1:29:55] the night shall be light about me."
[1:29:58] Amen. Are you talking about a
[1:29:59] revelation?
[1:30:00] This man know who he know God is with
[1:30:02] him. everywhere. He said, "Yay, the
[1:30:05] darkness hideth not from thee, but the
[1:30:07] night shining as the day." Said, "The
[1:30:10] darkness and the light are both a light
[1:30:11] to thee." See, he done got so far behind
[1:30:15] the veil to the darkness and the night
[1:30:16] to look the same. And that's how you got
[1:30:18] to get no matter how tough the trial
[1:30:20] get. No matter how tough the test get,
[1:30:23] you got to still be in the same
[1:30:24] condition. You got to be still acting
[1:30:26] the same way. You know, God is with you.
[1:30:29] We are believers. We come from God, we
[1:30:31] go back to God. There's no doubt in my
[1:30:34] mind that God is not with me. So, I'm
[1:30:36] just going to rest in assurance on the
[1:30:38] word of God, knowing that whenever I
[1:30:40] need him, he going to show up. Whenever
[1:30:42] I fall, he going to pick me up. Whenever
[1:30:45] I'm hungry, he going to put food on my
[1:30:47] table. Whenever I lost, he going to give
[1:30:49] me direction. And that's the way you got
[1:30:51] to serve God or not. You got to serve
[1:30:54] him like that tonight. No matter what
[1:30:56] you need tonight, God is more than able.
[1:31:00] We the bride should we should be resting
[1:31:02] tonight.
[1:31:04] We got all these promises.
[1:31:07] I I know the devil is going to poke on
[1:31:09] the outside, but on the inside we have
[1:31:11] the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost is rest
[1:31:15] and we should be resting.
[1:31:17] [Applause]
[1:31:29] Verse 13 says, "For thou has possessed
[1:31:31] my reigns. Thou has covered me in my
[1:31:34] mother's womb."
[1:31:36] He said, "I will praise thee, for I am
[1:31:40] fearfully and wonderfully made.
[1:31:43] Marvelous are thy works, and that my
[1:31:45] soul knoweth right well." He said, "My
[1:31:48] substance was not hid from thee when I
[1:31:51] was made in secret." He said, "And
[1:31:53] curiously wrought in the lowest parts of
[1:31:55] the earth." Thine eyes did see my
[1:31:57] substance. Yet being unperfect in thy
[1:32:01] book all my members were written, which
[1:32:04] in in continuence were fashioned, when
[1:32:07] as yet there was none of them. How
[1:32:10] precious also are thy thoughts unto me.
[1:32:14] How precious also are thy thoughts unto
[1:32:17] me. Oh God, how great is the sum of
[1:32:20] them. If I should count them, there are
[1:32:23] more in number than the sand when I
[1:32:25] awake. I am still with thee. You see,
[1:32:28] you see what God think about you. Do you
[1:32:31] see what he feel about you? We ought to
[1:32:34] be resting knowing that how he feel
[1:32:36] about us.
[1:32:39] We ought to be resting in the Holy Ghost
[1:32:41] tonight, knowing that we got a God that
[1:32:44] knoweth everything about us. He knows my
[1:32:47] thoughts. He knows my sitting down and
[1:32:49] my coming up. He knows my every natural
[1:32:52] being.
[1:32:55] Why we're not resting tonight?
[1:32:59] [Applause]
[1:33:06] In the book of Matthew,
[1:33:09] chapter 6, verse 25, the book of
[1:33:11] Matthew.
[1:33:14] Matthew says, "Therefore I say unto you,
[1:33:18] take no thought for your life,
[1:33:22] what you shall eat or what you shall
[1:33:25] drink, nor yet for your body, what you
[1:33:29] shall put on is not the life more than
[1:33:32] meat and the body than raignment." He
[1:33:35] says, "Behold the fowls of the air, for
[1:33:38] they sow not, neither do they reap, nor
[1:33:41] gather into barns." He said, "Yet your
[1:33:44] heavenly father feedth them, and ye not
[1:33:48] ye not much better than they." He said,
[1:33:51] "Which of you by taking thought can add
[1:33:53] one cubit into his statue." God don't
[1:33:57] want your
[1:33:58] [Applause]
[1:34:01] thoughts. That just how much he want you
[1:34:03] to rest in tonight. He don't even want
[1:34:05] you to think,
[1:34:07] but he want you to trust his word and
[1:34:09] lean on his word and believe in his
[1:34:11] word.
[1:34:13] He He cares so he cares so much about
[1:34:15] you tonight that he don't even want you
[1:34:18] thinking.
[1:34:20] [Applause]
[1:34:27] In verse 28 he says, "And why take ye
[1:34:30] these thought for ramen? Consider the
[1:34:32] liies of the field how they grow. They
[1:34:35] tore not neither do they spin." It says,
[1:34:39] "And yet I say unto you, that even
[1:34:41] Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed
[1:34:44] like one of these." Then he says,
[1:34:46] "Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass
[1:34:48] of the field, which today is, and
[1:34:51] tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall he
[1:34:54] not much more clothe you, oh ye of
[1:34:57] little faith." He said, "Therefore take
[1:34:59] no thought, saying that, what shall we
[1:35:02] eat, or what shall we drink, or where
[1:35:05] shall we be clothed? For all these
[1:35:08] things do the Gentiles seek. He say,
[1:35:10] "For your heavenly Father knoweth that
[1:35:12] you have need of all these things." He
[1:35:15] said, "But seek you first the kingdom of
[1:35:17] God, and in his righteousness, and all
[1:35:20] these things shall be added unto you.
[1:35:22] Take therefore no thought for tomorrow.
[1:35:25] For tomorrow shall take thought for the
[1:35:27] things of itself, sufficient unto the
[1:35:30] day, is the evil thereof."
[1:35:34] This is how much God think about you.
[1:35:37] And and and and God is he's not pleased
[1:35:40] when he see a Christian not resting when
[1:35:42] he when he already equipped you with the
[1:35:45] mechanism and everything you need to
[1:35:47] rest. And God saying I I done laid the
[1:35:50] word out. Your your rest is in my word.
[1:35:53] All you got to do is take me at my word.
[1:35:56] And when you take me at my word, then
[1:35:57] you'll find rest.
[1:35:59] [Applause]
[1:36:02] Let's let's go to the this message. Why
[1:36:05] are people so tossed about?
[1:36:08] In 1956,
[1:36:10] paragraph 60.
[1:36:13] Brother Bernham says, "Now our faith
[1:36:16] cannot rest upon nothing."
[1:36:19] A Christian has to have his faith. He
[1:36:22] has to have a solid resting place. You
[1:36:25] know that. Yes, sir. And the only
[1:36:27] resting place that a Christian, a true
[1:36:30] bornag again Christian can rest, his
[1:36:32] faith or hers is upon the unmovable word
[1:36:35] of God. It isn't built upon the shifting
[1:36:38] sands of men's theology and doctrines.
[1:36:41] Yes, sir. And upon some church
[1:36:43] affiliation, he says, "But a true
[1:36:45] believer, Yes, sir. has faith." Amen.
[1:36:48] And it rests solidly. Yes, sir.
[1:36:51] Unshifting, Amen. as he approaches the
[1:36:53] word of God. That's right. and and he
[1:36:56] says, "I was saying somewhere maybe here
[1:36:58] a few nights ago." He said, "I wanted to
[1:37:00] preach so bad." He said, "I preached to
[1:37:02] my wife in bed to 12:00."
[1:37:07] Just telling her of how glorious Jesus
[1:37:09] was. He said, "A text come in my heart
[1:37:12] and it kept burning me so great."
[1:37:15] He said, "Till I just couldn't rest with
[1:37:17] it." He saying, "I just said, "Honey, I
[1:37:19] want to preach to you a little while."
[1:37:24] Yeah, I used to feel bad cuz I used to
[1:37:26] keep my wife up
[1:37:27] sometimes, you know, that the closest
[1:37:29] thing to us and and when we get that
[1:37:31] that that itch, we know we want to
[1:37:33] preach to somebody, they right there,
[1:37:35] you know. So, I got to start I start
[1:37:36] preaching to her
[1:37:38] sometimes. He said, and he say he saying
[1:37:41] she rose up and by grace she listened.
[1:37:47] Yes, sir. And he said he said I said the
[1:37:49] Christian faith Uhhuh. is based solidly
[1:37:52] Uhhuh. upon rest. Yes, sir. He said
[1:37:55] that's right. Yes, sir. A Christian is
[1:37:57] not tossed about. No sir. He said a
[1:38:00] Christian doesn't run from place to
[1:38:01] place. No sir. A Christian doesn't fuss
[1:38:04] and fume and worry about things. He
[1:38:07] said, "A Christian rest is all over.
[1:38:11] It's all finished for the believer at
[1:38:13] Calvary." That's right. Oh, sickness may
[1:38:16] comes and disappointment, but the
[1:38:18] Christian is at rest.
[1:38:23] So, he didn't he didn't say we're not
[1:38:25] exempt from sicknesses, you know. We're
[1:38:27] not a sentence from disappointment.
[1:38:29] We're not exempted from these things. He
[1:38:30] said, "But we should be able to find
[1:38:32] rest in the midst of
[1:38:34] all. Yes.
[1:38:37] Amen. Glory to God. Say, but the
[1:38:40] Christian is at rest knowing this.
[1:38:43] Uhhuh. That God is able Yes, sir. to
[1:38:46] keep that which he has performed. Yes,
[1:38:48] sir. knowing that no matter what the
[1:38:50] thing is
[1:38:52] and how it looks, there is neither
[1:38:54] sickness, sorrow, death, there is
[1:38:58] neither starvation or anything that can
[1:39:02] separate us from the love of God that's
[1:39:04] in Jesus Christ. Yes, sir. And he says
[1:39:06] we are at rest. He said just let that
[1:39:10] old ship toss any way she wants to. The
[1:39:12] anchor holds and the word of God, the
[1:39:15] Holy Ghost is our anchor tonight. We
[1:39:18] don't it don't matter how rough it get
[1:39:19] on the outside, but we have an anchor on
[1:39:21] the inside that will stabilize us in the
[1:39:24] time of a storm. It will give us peace
[1:39:26] in the midst of the storm.
[1:39:30] In paragraph 193, he says, "And when the
[1:39:32] trial of the enemy comes up, it'll be so
[1:39:35] far away outside the veil that they
[1:39:39] don't even hear it." That's it. He said,
[1:39:41] "A Christian be so h behind the veil."
[1:39:44] That's right. that when trials and
[1:39:45] tribulations come up, they'll be so far
[1:39:47] that they will they won't even be able
[1:39:48] to hear it. He said they'll just only
[1:39:51] see Jesus.
[1:39:53] So it don't matter what the enemy do,
[1:39:55] I'm going to see Jesus.
[1:39:59] The guy spit in David face, David saw
[1:40:02] Jesus and spit. He saw Jesus. He said,
[1:40:05] he said, "Leave him alone. God had it
[1:40:07] done." He saw Jesus and spit. Now if
[1:40:10] David could see Jesus and spent, how
[1:40:12] much more mean you can see him in all
[1:40:14] things?
[1:40:16] [Applause]
[1:40:20] Amen. Amen. Amen. Glory to God. Noah
[1:40:25] found grace with God. He found favor.
[1:40:27] Yes, sir. And and and he was anointed to
[1:40:30] build a ark. That's right. And in that
[1:40:32] ark was his place of safety. That was
[1:40:34] his place of rest. Right? So, we as
[1:40:38] believers, we we already have favor in
[1:40:41] God. That's what I'm trying to get you
[1:40:43] to understand. These things already
[1:40:45] belong to us. We we already have favor
[1:40:47] with God. And we already have the Holy
[1:40:50] Ghost because he saw us with it before
[1:40:52] the foundation of the world. So, that
[1:40:54] Holy Ghost possessed that rest that we
[1:40:56] ought to be in when these when the when
[1:40:58] the storm comes. That's right. When the
[1:41:00] pressure comes, we should be resting.
[1:41:02] Yes, sir. The world should be in turmoil
[1:41:04] right now because they don't know what's
[1:41:06] going on. They don't know the end. But
[1:41:08] you and I know our end. So that's why we
[1:41:11] should be resting. It don't it don't
[1:41:13] matter what what tomorrow what going to
[1:41:15] happen tomorrow. We already know who
[1:41:16] holds tomorrow. So that why we can rest
[1:41:19] on the unfellable word of God.
[1:41:26] Hallelujah. Let's turn to the book of
[1:41:28] Genesis. Hallelujah. Wonderful.
[1:41:32] Yes, my brother. Book of Genesis. Yes,
[1:41:34] sir. Chapter 39.
[1:41:38] Yes, sir.
[1:41:42] Yes, my brother. A believer
[1:41:45] is so equipped with attributes of the
[1:41:48] Holy Ghost. Like I say, it's not
[1:41:50] something you can turn on and it ain't
[1:41:52] nothing you can turn off because it's a
[1:41:55] gift. And some sometimes a believer can
[1:42:00] be a victim of finding rest sometimes
[1:42:02] and God have to send pressure and
[1:42:04] trouble just to move you along because
[1:42:07] it's not it's not our fault that we're
[1:42:08] equipped and and some somehow we'll
[1:42:11] always find rest no matter how bad it
[1:42:13] get. A believer will always find rest
[1:42:17] in in chapter 39.
[1:42:20] Verse one,
[1:42:23] the Bible says, "And Joseph
[1:42:26] was brought down to Egypt." Yes, sir.
[1:42:29] And Pontifher, an officer of Pharaoh.
[1:42:31] That's right. Captain of the guard. Yes,
[1:42:33] sir. An Egyptian
[1:42:35] bought him of the hands of the
[1:42:37] Israelites,
[1:42:38] which had brought him down the other.
[1:42:42] And the Lord was with Joseph. And he was
[1:42:45] a prosperous man, and he was in the
[1:42:47] house of his master, the Egyptian. Yes,
[1:42:50] sir. And his master saw that the Lord
[1:42:53] was with him.
[1:42:56] And that the Lord made all that he did
[1:42:58] to prosper in his hand. Yes, sir. And
[1:43:01] Joseph found grace. See, there's that
[1:43:04] favor.
[1:43:06] A believer always going to find favor
[1:43:08] with God because because we possess
[1:43:10] favor.
[1:43:12] It's something that he already gave us.
[1:43:14] We're going to always find favor with
[1:43:15] God. Yes, sir. He said, "And Joseph
[1:43:18] found grace in his sight and he served
[1:43:20] him and he made him overseer over his
[1:43:24] house and all that he had he put into
[1:43:26] his hands." Yes, sir. Now, this at at
[1:43:29] the beginning, this seemed like to be a
[1:43:31] bad thing. When when when Joseph was put
[1:43:34] in the well and they sold him and he end
[1:43:36] up in he end up in Polifer's house, it
[1:43:39] seemed like a bad thing. But see, Joseph
[1:43:41] taught Christ and and it's a true
[1:43:43] example how a believer will always find
[1:43:46] rest. And when Joseph found grace in his
[1:43:50] sight, he served him and he made him
[1:43:52] overseer. See, in a bad situation,
[1:43:56] Joseph was able to find rest.
[1:43:59] He was able to find rest. And and and
[1:44:03] like I said, it looked like a bad thing,
[1:44:05] but they put him they put him in his
[1:44:06] house and he found rest. Yeah. And and
[1:44:09] that's the reason God had us in trouble.
[1:44:11] He had to create a lie. Yes, sir. To
[1:44:14] come down and push him from that
[1:44:15] position because he would he hadn't
[1:44:16] reached his final destination yet. But
[1:44:19] because he was a believer and he found
[1:44:21] favor in God. And after he found favor,
[1:44:24] he found a place of rest. So, Joseph got
[1:44:27] comfortable.
[1:44:29] [Music]
[1:44:31] He found he found rest in the midst of
[1:44:33] trouble. And God said, "Hold my my my
[1:44:36] son. I I know I equip you with rest and
[1:44:39] you found that rest, but you hadn't
[1:44:40] quite reached your final destination
[1:44:42] yet. So, I need to send some trouble to
[1:44:44] move you over a little bit.
[1:44:50] [Applause]
[1:44:53] Skip skip over to verse 20. I I want you
[1:44:56] to see every time the music seat
[1:44:58] changed, Joseph was able to find rest.
[1:45:02] In verse 20, it says, "And Joseph master
[1:45:05] took him and put him into the prison."
[1:45:08] Uhhuh. A place where the king's
[1:45:10] prisoners were bound. Uhhuh. And he was
[1:45:12] there in the prison. Uhhuh. But the Lord
[1:45:15] was with Joseph. And showed him mercy.
[1:45:18] There go that favor. Amen. It's that
[1:45:20] favor just hanging around. It It don't
[1:45:22] go nowhere. It can't go nowhere. God
[1:45:25] gave it to you. He can't take it back.
[1:45:27] It just following him. It belongs to
[1:45:30] you.
[1:45:31] That's why I'm trying to tell you this
[1:45:33] rest belongs to you. You were able to
[1:45:35] rest. God can't take that rest back from
[1:45:37] you.
[1:45:41] It say, "But the Lord was with Joseph
[1:45:43] and showed him mercy." Amen. That's that
[1:45:45] favor. And gave him favor in the sight
[1:45:47] of the keeper of the prison. And the
[1:45:49] keeper of the prison committed to Joseph
[1:45:52] hand all the prisoners that were in the
[1:45:54] prison. And whatsoever they did there,
[1:45:57] he was the doer of it. Uhhuh. And and
[1:46:00] and not if you notice, not only Joseph
[1:46:02] was at rest, but because of him,
[1:46:04] everything around him
[1:46:07] was at peace. Everything around him was
[1:46:10] at rest. Because of who Joseph was, they
[1:46:13] was able to be blessed because of him.
[1:46:16] So when they was being blessed, that put
[1:46:18] them in a state of rest. They was able
[1:46:20] to rest based off of Joseph's rest.
[1:46:25] And and and that's what God does. He get
[1:46:27] on the inside of you and he he needs a
[1:46:30] place to lay his head. He want to rest
[1:46:32] inside of you. And once you let him in,
[1:46:34] he begin to rest. And then because of
[1:46:36] that, you begin to rest. Resting on the
[1:46:39] inside, resting on the outside. It's
[1:46:42] just a state of rest.
[1:46:46] That's why he says in chapter 40:14,
[1:46:49] he said, "But think on me when it shall
[1:46:51] be well with thee while you're resting."
[1:46:53] and think on me and show kindness while
[1:46:56] you're resting. He say, I pray thee unto
[1:46:59] me and make mention of me.
[1:47:02] That's the part where the test and
[1:47:03] trials are at. God say be at rest in
[1:47:06] that stage. Be at rest in that stage.
[1:47:08] And he say when I bring you out of this
[1:47:10] house, when I deliver you, then you
[1:47:12] reach that that rest, that eternal rest.
[1:47:15] See, you got to you got to realize this
[1:47:16] rest is eternal.
[1:47:18] This this is this is not something that
[1:47:20] God give you rest on one day like this
[1:47:22] like the the day of the Sabbath. But
[1:47:24] this is an eternal Sabbath. This is an
[1:47:26] eternal rest. You this rest has no end
[1:47:29] to it. It has no certain day to it. You
[1:47:33] can rest for from Monday to Sunday 24/7
[1:47:37] 365. This is an eternal
[1:47:40] rest. It came from God and it going back
[1:47:42] to God. It has no beginning and no end
[1:47:45] to it.
[1:47:49] Amen.
[1:47:52] Hallelujah.
[1:47:54] Glory to God. In the book of Hebrews.
[1:47:56] Yes, sir. Chapter 3. Amen. Verse one.
[1:48:00] Glory to God.
[1:48:02] [Music]
[1:48:08] The Bible says, "Wherefore, holy
[1:48:11] brethren,
[1:48:12] partakers of the heavenly calling." Yes,
[1:48:15] my brother. Consider the apostle and the
[1:48:17] high priest of our profession. Yes sir.
[1:48:19] Christ Jesus sir who was faithful to him
[1:48:22] that appointed him. Yes sir. As also
[1:48:25] Moses was faithful in all his house. Yes
[1:48:27] sir. Say for this man was counted worthy
[1:48:30] of more glory than Moses. And as much as
[1:48:33] he who have built the house have more
[1:48:35] honor than the house. Say for every
[1:48:37] house is built by some man. But he that
[1:48:40] build all things is God.
[1:48:43] And Moses verily was faithful in all his
[1:48:45] house as a servant for a testimony of
[1:48:47] those things which were to be spoken
[1:48:49] after. It said, "But Christ is a son
[1:48:52] over his own house, whose house are we?"
[1:48:55] If we hold fast the confidence and the
[1:48:57] rejoicing of the hope, firm unto the
[1:48:59] end. Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith
[1:49:02] today, if you will hear his voice,
[1:49:04] harden not your hearts as into pro
[1:49:07] provocation in the day of temptation in
[1:49:09] the wilderness. said, "When your father
[1:49:11] tempted me, proved me and saw my works
[1:49:13] 40 years, said wherefore I was grieved
[1:49:16] with that generation, and said, they do
[1:49:18] always er in their heart, and they have
[1:49:21] not known my ways. So I swear in my
[1:49:23] wrath, that they shall not enter into my
[1:49:25] rest." That's right. Take heed,
[1:49:27] brethren, lest there be any of you an
[1:49:29] evil heart of unbelief is departing from
[1:49:31] the living God. Amen. And God God is
[1:49:35] saying when you don't take him at his
[1:49:37] word that that that's an attribute of
[1:49:39] unbelief. And so and and because of you
[1:49:42] not taking him with his word, you don't
[1:49:45] get to enter into that rest. That's it.
[1:49:47] Amen. That's the rest is only on the
[1:49:51] word of God. And and if you can't take
[1:49:53] him at his word, you can't enter into
[1:49:55] that rest. And and and it's because of
[1:49:57] unbelief.
[1:49:58] And and and I think about the word
[1:50:00] anxiety. I I hear that word so much.
[1:50:04] It seems like it's common now. They
[1:50:06] trying that that devil trying to make it
[1:50:07] common. Anxiety is a common thing. But
[1:50:10] anxiety is nothing but fear.
[1:50:13] It's just a devil of fear. That's all it
[1:50:16] is. And and the enemy has crept into the
[1:50:19] believers and trying to convince them
[1:50:22] that anxiety is common and all it is is
[1:50:24] a cover up for fear. And when you when
[1:50:27] you possess fear now, you have unbelief
[1:50:29] in the word of God.
[1:50:32] [Applause]
[1:50:39] Verse 12 says, "Take heed, brethren,
[1:50:42] lest there be any of you an evil heart
[1:50:44] of unbelief and departing from the
[1:50:46] living God." Said, "But exhort one
[1:50:48] another daily while it is called today,
[1:50:50] lest any of you be hardened through the
[1:50:52] deceitfulness of sin."
[1:50:54] say, "For we are made partakers of
[1:50:56] Christ, that we hold the beginning of
[1:50:58] our confidence, steadfast until the end.
[1:51:01] While it is said, today, if you hear his
[1:51:03] voice, harden not your heart, as in the
[1:51:05] provocation. For some, when they heard,
[1:51:08] they provoked." How about not all that
[1:51:10] came out of Egypt by Moses? But with
[1:51:12] whom was he grieved 40 years? Was it not
[1:51:15] with them that had sinned, who carcasses
[1:51:17] fell in the wilderness? That's right.
[1:51:19] And to whom swear he that they should
[1:51:21] not enter into his rest, but to them
[1:51:22] that believe not. So we see that they
[1:51:25] could not enter in because of unbelief.
[1:51:30] [Music]
[1:51:38] lest they promise being left us of
[1:51:40] entering into his rest. Any of you
[1:51:42] should seem to come short of it. He
[1:51:44] said, "For unto us was the gospel
[1:51:46] preached as well as to them, but the
[1:51:49] word preached did not profit them."
[1:51:51] That's not being mixed with faith and
[1:51:53] them that heard it. He said, "For we
[1:51:56] which have believed do enter into rest."
[1:51:59] That's us tonight. As he said, as I have
[1:52:02] sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter
[1:52:04] into my rest, although the works were
[1:52:06] finished from the foundation of the
[1:52:08] world, from the foundation of the world.
[1:52:11] Amen. It say for he spake in a certain
[1:52:13] place of the seventh day on the wise and
[1:52:16] God did rest the seventh day from all
[1:52:18] his works and in this place again if
[1:52:20] they shall enter into my rest seeing
[1:52:23] therefore it remainth that some must
[1:52:25] enter therein and they to whom it was
[1:52:27] preached first preached enter not in
[1:52:30] because of unbelief again he limited a
[1:52:33] certain day saying and David today after
[1:52:35] so long a time as it is said today if
[1:52:38] you will hear his voice harden not your
[1:52:40] hearts For if Jesus had given them rest,
[1:52:43] then will he not afterward have spoken
[1:52:44] of another day, there remained therefore
[1:52:47] a rest to the people of God. For he that
[1:52:51] is enter into his rest, he also have
[1:52:53] ceased from his own works, as God did
[1:52:56] from his, let us labor therefore to
[1:52:59] enter into that rest, lest any man fall
[1:53:02] after that same example of unbelief.
[1:53:04] That's right. Yes, my brother. Yes, sir.
[1:53:08] Yes, sir. Let's turn to the book of
[1:53:12] Matthew think chapter 12 I think. Let me
[1:53:14] see man.
[1:53:25] Yes sir. Matthew 12:43.
[1:53:31] Amen. The Bible says when the unclean
[1:53:34] spirit
[1:53:39] is gone out of a man.
[1:53:42] Say he walketh through dry places
[1:53:45] seeking rest
[1:53:47] and he findeth none.
[1:53:50] Say then he
[1:53:52] saith. Listen to what he said. He said,
[1:53:55] "I will return
[1:53:57] into my house."
[1:54:02] So this unsplain, this unclean spirit is
[1:54:04] calling your temple.
[1:54:08] his house.
[1:54:11] [Applause]
[1:54:14] He said, he said, "I will return into my
[1:54:16] house, for hence I came out." He say,
[1:54:20] when he has come, he findeth empty,
[1:54:22] swept, and garnished. Then he goeth, and
[1:54:25] he take with himself seven other
[1:54:27] spirits, more wicked than himself, and
[1:54:30] there enter in and dwell there. And the
[1:54:33] last state of the man is worse than the
[1:54:34] first. Even so shall it be also unto
[1:54:37] this wicked generation.
[1:54:40] So even this this unclean spirit is
[1:54:42] seeking rest. Say, but when he goes out
[1:54:46] and when he comes back to look in there,
[1:54:49] if that Holy Ghost is present, all he
[1:54:52] can do is poke on the outside.
[1:54:55] He can't get in. All he can do is poke
[1:54:57] on the outside.
[1:54:59] You are on the inside resting. Yes sir.
[1:55:03] Yes sir. You you see what the Holy Ghost
[1:55:06] does. You you are you are exempt from
[1:55:10] from him coming back in. You are in a
[1:55:13] resting state. You are in a resting
[1:55:15] mode. Though he may come back though he
[1:55:18] may try to work on your outside. He may
[1:55:20] work on your emotions. He may work on
[1:55:22] your feelings but he can't get on the
[1:55:25] inside. And that ought to be enough to
[1:55:27] make you rest.
[1:55:29] That ought to make you enough to be in
[1:55:31] assurance. That ought to make you rest
[1:55:33] knowing that God fixed this thing. He
[1:55:36] done fixed it so you can't go out and he
[1:55:39] can't come in.
[1:55:40] [Music]
[1:55:41] [Applause]
[1:55:49] Glory to God.
[1:55:52] [Applause]
[1:55:53] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:55:59] Glory to God.
[1:56:02] Let's turn to the book of Daniel,
[1:56:04] chapter 3.
[1:56:18] A believer always find rest.
[1:56:21] Believer always find rest. Chapter
[1:56:25] 12. And these are believers in the Bible
[1:56:28] and they found rest in the midst of
[1:56:30] turmoil. Yes sir.
[1:56:34] Chapter 12. No. Yeah. Chapter two.
[1:56:37] Chapter 3 verse 12. Yes sir. There it
[1:56:40] says there are certain Jews whom thou
[1:56:42] has set over the affairs of the pro
[1:56:44] province of Babylon. Shadrachite,
[1:56:47] Meshach and Abednego. We know this
[1:56:49] story. Say these men, oh king, have not
[1:56:52] regarded thee. They serve not thy gods,
[1:56:56] nor worship the golden image which thou
[1:56:58] hast set up set
[1:57:00] up. Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and
[1:57:03] fury commanded to bring Shadrach,
[1:57:05] Meshach, and Abednego. This is the
[1:57:07] response of believers. Okay. Say, then
[1:57:10] they brought these men before the king.
[1:57:13] Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them
[1:57:14] and say, "Is it true, oh Shadrach, Mach,
[1:57:17] and Abednego, do not serve, do not ye
[1:57:21] serve my gods, nor worship the golden
[1:57:23] image which I have set up." And he says,
[1:57:26] "Now if you be ready that at what time
[1:57:28] you hear the sound of the cornet, the
[1:57:30] flute, the harp, the sackbutt, the
[1:57:33] soldery, and doulamer and all and all
[1:57:36] kinds of music.
[1:57:39] I'm
[1:57:40] leave I'mma leave that
[1:57:43] there. That's another whole avenue
[1:57:46] there. All kinds of
[1:57:49] music. We we don't believe in all kinds
[1:57:52] of music. So, so, so we are we we
[1:57:54] already know who this is right here.
[1:58:00] He he says, "You fall down and worship
[1:58:03] the image which I have made." Well, but
[1:58:07] if you worship not, you shall be cast
[1:58:09] the same hour into the midst of a
[1:58:12] burning fiery furnace. And who is that
[1:58:14] God that shall deliver you out of my
[1:58:16] hands?
[1:58:19] Here go the response of a believer.
[1:58:22] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered
[1:58:25] and said to the king, "Oh,
[1:58:27] Nebuchadnezzar,
[1:58:29] we are not careful
[1:58:31] to answer thee in this matter." Yes,
[1:58:34] sir. So, ba So, basically what they
[1:58:36] saying,
[1:58:38] they they weren't even careful about
[1:58:39] what they was going to say about it.
[1:58:45] [Music]
[1:58:47] God said, "Take take no thought."
[1:58:50] He said, "Take no thought what you will
[1:58:52] say in that hour."
[1:58:55] [Applause]
[1:59:00] He said, "Take no thought what you would
[1:59:02] say in that hour." So, so Shar, Meshach,
[1:59:05] and Abednego say, "We're not going to
[1:59:07] even be careful about how we answer
[1:59:08] this."
[1:59:11] He he he they say if it be so
[1:59:14] our God whom we serve is able to deliver
[1:59:18] us from the burning fiery furnace. And
[1:59:21] he say and he will deliver us out of thy
[1:59:24] hand oh king. This is the example of a
[1:59:28] believer. Yes sir. He say but he say but
[1:59:31] if not come on. Be it known unto thee oh
[1:59:36] king Yes sir. that we will not Yes.
[1:59:39] serve thy gods, nor worship the golden
[1:59:42] image which thou has set has set up.
[1:59:46] Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury,
[1:59:48] and the form of his vision was changed
[1:59:50] against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
[1:59:52] Therefore, he
[1:59:54] spake and commanded that they should
[1:59:56] heat the furnace seven times more than
[1:59:58] it was want to be heated. And they was
[2:00:02] already in a they was already resting.
[2:00:05] and and and basically they were saying
[2:00:06] Nebuchadnezzar, why you disturbing my
[2:00:10] rest? I'm resting in my God. I'm
[2:00:13] enjoying my God. And and here you come
[2:00:16] about the fire. We don't care about the
[2:00:18] furnace. We're resting in our God. And
[2:00:21] he says, "And he commanded the most
[2:00:23] mighty men that were in his army to bind
[2:00:25] Sharite, Mach, and Abednego, and to cast
[2:00:28] them into the burning fiery furnace.
[2:00:31] Then these men were bound in their
[2:00:33] coats, their hosom, and their hats, and
[2:00:35] their other garments, and were cast into
[2:00:37] the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
[2:00:40] Now watch verse 22. It say, "Therefore,
[2:00:42] because the king's commandment was
[2:00:44] urgent, and the furnace was a seeding
[2:00:47] hot, the flames of the fire slew those
[2:00:49] men that took up Shadrach, Mesach, and
[2:00:52] Abednego."
[2:00:53] Now, that should have been a sign right
[2:00:55] there.
[2:00:58] That should have been a sign right
[2:00:59] there. Amen. That should have been a
[2:01:01] sign. See, God always assure his
[2:01:04] believers.
[2:01:05] He always give them a sign that he is
[2:01:08] with them.
[2:01:11] [Applause]
[2:01:14] God don't never see you in the fiery
[2:01:16] furnace without equipping you with a
[2:01:19] sign of assurance that he is with you.
[2:01:22] Yes, sir. And and I and I look at that
[2:01:25] as a sign cuz I I know they saw these
[2:01:27] men get slew and I know Sharite them had
[2:01:29] to look at theirelves and say, "Well, he
[2:01:30] he being slew, but I'm still here."
[2:01:34] Oh, he got to be in here. You know, and
[2:01:36] that's that's an assurance.
[2:01:38] And it says, "And these three men,
[2:01:41] Shadrach, Mach, and Abilneo, fell down
[2:01:44] bound in the midst of the burning fiery
[2:01:45] furnace. Then Nebuchadnezzar the king
[2:01:47] was astonished and rose up in haste and
[2:01:50] spake and said unto his counselors, "Did
[2:01:52] not we cast three bound into the midst
[2:01:54] of the fire?" They answered and said to
[2:01:56] the king, "True, O king." He answered
[2:01:59] and said, "Lo, I see four men loose
[2:02:02] walking in the midst of the fire, and
[2:02:04] they have no hurt, and the form of the
[2:02:06] fourth is like the son of son of God."
[2:02:09] What I want to draw from this is that
[2:02:11] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego was
[2:02:13] resting before the fiery furnace. When
[2:02:16] they went in the fiery furnace, they
[2:02:18] were still resting. And when they came
[2:02:20] out of the fiery fence, they were still
[2:02:23] resting. There's no disturbance in that
[2:02:25] rest. You believer, you should be
[2:02:27] continually resting, constantly resting.
[2:02:30] It don't matter how tough it get, you
[2:02:32] should continually be resting. It should
[2:02:34] be a rotating clock. You should be able
[2:02:36] to find rest.
[2:02:39] [Music]
[2:02:41] Amen.
[2:02:43] Amen.
[2:02:46] Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[2:02:51] And I want to I want to leave you with
[2:02:52] this quote right here. Making a making a
[2:02:54] way.
[2:02:56] Making a way. 1956.
[2:02:59] Brother Benham says, "Our heavenly
[2:03:01] father, hallelujah, we want to thank
[2:03:03] thee from the very depths of our hearts.
[2:03:07] knowing that we are waiting here not
[2:03:10] frustrated at all.
[2:03:13] No matter how many atomic bombs they
[2:03:15] make
[2:03:17] and how many civil service people they
[2:03:19] put out to watch the planes. He said the
[2:03:22] world nervous and shaky. He said but we
[2:03:25] are
[2:03:29] resting s. He said we are resting upon
[2:03:33] this blessed hope that we have. said,
[2:03:36] "We're trusting in the finished work of
[2:03:39] God at Calvary through Christ, knowing
[2:03:43] this that after this earthly tabernacle
[2:03:46] is no more, we got one already waiting
[2:03:49] yonder, more glorious, far more where
[2:03:53] there's no pain, no suffering, no
[2:03:56] suffering, no sickness, suffering, no
[2:03:59] old age, will ever strike it." He says,
[2:04:02] "Never a gray hair." He says never a
[2:04:05] wrinkle. He said, "But we'll be young
[2:04:07] there forever." Yes, sir. He said, "The
[2:04:10] blessed Bible, which cannot tell nothing
[2:04:12] but the truth, has given us the this
[2:04:15] blessed assurance. And the Holy Ghost
[2:04:17] also is a witness, bearing record of the
[2:04:20] same." Yes, sir. Our hearts long for
[2:04:22] that. And we know the Bible tells us so,
[2:04:26] which is the word of God, the seeds to
[2:04:28] be planted upon this fertile ground.
[2:04:31] Amen. to let us rest in this hope. Give
[2:04:35] the Lord a great big hands up

[2:05:38] because you came from God and you were
[2:05:41] predestinated to receive the Holy Ghost.
[2:05:45] Amen. If you unsure, that rest is still
[2:05:48] there. This world is completely in
[2:05:51] turmoil.
[2:05:52] People don't know what to do.
[2:05:55] They trusted so much and things are
[2:05:57] going out of Kaider.
[2:05:59] Amen. You need a solid rest knowing that
[2:06:04] God is in control of your life. And no
[2:06:06] matter what's going on, God knows what
[2:06:09] he's doing. This message is so anointed.

[2:06:43] very simple scripture. I didn't see how
[2:06:45] he was laying there and it take all the
[2:06:47] ages. When you read the Bible, be really
[2:06:50] be careful. Every single I mean every
[2:06:53] numbering, everything that is coming out
[2:06:56] of the without this message, there is no
