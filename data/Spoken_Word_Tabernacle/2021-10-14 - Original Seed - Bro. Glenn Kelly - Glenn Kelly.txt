have to come come up here after uh sunday huh christ i'll tell you what he's doing for us huh opening that word i tell you it's just a blessing to know what the lord those things he had hidden for just his bride and just as elect in this hour here now so we won't prolong the time i tell you it's it's it's just i tell you my heart was just on fire and i just recognized how god is not finished yet because he is eternal right and we won't prolong the time we know it's wednesday night god bless you sister and all those that are not here our prayers are with you let's look at genesis 1 hallelujah and verse 1 she have it say amen in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth may the lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated and we read another scripture over here in psalms 33 and 6. he says by the word of the lord where the heavens made and all the hosts of him by the breath of his mouth amen you know after you look and see what the lord did for us sonny how you how can you get away from the mouth the tongue and the lips i couldn't get away from it if i wanted to i'll tell you i got this inspiration what we're going to look at here tonight is the spoken word is the original seed of god now when you start dealing with the spoken word of the original seed of god you know the ones that study this message i need your prayers tonight because even the prophet it took him six hours he went through this six hours in this message so you have to understand i tell you could take a message a nugget out of this and preach it from now until the rapture take place if you go back and and i beseech you my brothers and sisters go look into that message it's a timely message when god has anointed for this time here now you know we look at because in the beginning we know god created what the heavens and the earth and god he said when he spoke there that's why we're talking about the infallible word of god and then god he came he said god said let there be one light is that right who said let there be light god said it so if god says something then that means it has to happen is that right you don't have to worry about anything in this hour here now okay i'm telling you if god said it he's got a witness from the beginning it's going to happen is that right hallelujah and god saw the light and then it was good and god divided the light from the darkness and god called the light what they god called the light day is that right so god called the light they then it's going to be day is that right the word of god is infallible is that right so we're moving into something when god start talking about opening about your tongue and your mouth and your lips that's a powerful thing what god wants to do now is bring you back into authority that's exactly what he's doing we're talking about the spoken word is that right when you start talking about the spoken word is the original seed now we're going to take our time because i'm not going to get all this done tonight i don't know why the pastor wants this spare tire up here you know that but i'm telling you now we're going to move into it slowly we got scriptures and we're going to move in because what it's bringing you back to is your origin where you come from now we're talking about something that powerful so the spoken word is the original seed is that right so we know that we was not originally supposed to come from sex is that right originally it was supposed to come it was going to happen it was going to come to pass but eve then what she got deceived by the serpent is that right but we were if we were a spoken word we were in the back of the mind of god is that right if we were out there all in the universe and god was out there all alone so god he was what elohim is that right then he became jehovah he said but now once god came and he sought to let there be light and he moved the waters is that right then everything no seed had to do what bring forth of its kind is that right but where were we at we're in the mind of god god created it says in the beginning is that right that's why you got these intellectuals these scientists and the people out here fussing about a time huh let me read something for you here's out of the fourth seal and like i said i don't have the board so i'm have to read it and keep moving he said this is out of the fourth seal remember someone approached the prophet of god about the the number of years it took to make of heavens and the earth is that right he said that uh i said that didn't have anything to do in genesis genesis 1 says in the beginning is that right that we were in the beginning so how can you put a beginning on god [Music] in the beginning now we're moving into the mind of god tonight have your way lord have your way on this we're moving into the mind of god tonight god didn't speak until over the world the third verse is that right so that means you were in the mind of god we were in the rain of god when god said let there be light the logos went out right that was christ the spirit of god went all over the land we're going to look into the scriptures we're going to see why how blessed you are you're going to see that you are the seed of christ you are the seed of god you are the ones that god has saved the best for life we in the real world but we got the victory the victories is our we're taking everything back and not losing the one [Music] that's why god wants you to control your tongue no way no way a man could have opened that god open that up now is the time now he's bringing us into it brother god spoke it we ain't got to the mind yet god spoke it is that right if god said it i believe it then that's it stand on it is that right look what he said he said now in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth said period he said that's all now the world was out of form and void just like it's getting to be a mess now three four dollars of gasoline stocks going down they don't know what to do he said now look he says but now in the world without reforming i believe every seed was laying right there from some other civilization or something as soon as the water lifted off the light struck it and come trees and everything else oh but look at us and the same thing with the human being he said a type when all the myths moved away and revealed truth to the real sea laying there it's still germantized see everybody we're going to show you through the scriptures only the elector he saved the best for last only elect is the one that i have what they're going to be able to see and hear what you're hearing right now okay help me lord he said now he said laying there is still germatized if i don't get through it keep in mind that word dermatized he said now he said in the light of the gospel can strike it by truth in vindication of the word he said it'll live it's got life in it i'll it'll believe see you to believe it'll live the only way you're living here now is because you got life inside of you huh you got it inside of you now you see why i said we should be the happiest people in the land right now all right we know where we come from we know where we're going we know why we're sent here is that right hallelujah he said now look outside of that it can't live it hasn't got life so now we're moving i don't know who's live streaming but you may hear some things tonight and that i hope and shake you and get you right because we're not going to hold any punches we're talking about winning soul we're talking about you in a war we're talking about the authentic word of god it's supposed to produce what it's supposed to produce in this age right now you're not going to turn them god didn't just have you here for no reason at all he hit us and saved the best for last his bride is that right on his precious bride look what he says here we read down there i'm still in the message god spoke the original seed if you're taking your notes and we reverse uh paragraph 30. he said now this word of god is eternal god being infinite cannot speak one thing and then later on change it to something else why are we not taking him and speaking him and believing his word for just what he said [Music] you don't have to be afraid to speak anything is that right if god said it it's a promise under you it's yours don't be afraid god's going to bring it to pass when he sees fit to bring it to pass but he's going to bring it to pass because what we're asking we're asking according to his will not our will [Applause] he said now look he says now god he can change it to something else he can't change it better he can't go to a better decision huh that's right brother no huh he said because every decision of god is what ah he was what perfect right he found what grace and with god is that right because he walked with the white the lord told us sunday what the rain when we spoke he spoke the way now you're walking perfectly with god because you know we can't change life and death lies in the tongue look over to genesis 6. let's go to genesis 6 help us lord he said now look hallelujah who are we walking there uh let's look at verse eight the purpose of the lord in grace he says but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord he said these are the generations noah noah was a just man any what perfect in his generation and noah did what walk with god huh scripture backed it up the word is what perfect is that right we got the what the perfect word is that right we got the infallible word of god is that right we're not going to fail anything is not going to fail is that right god has given us the absolute let me keep going because i got many scriptures i want you to see he said now he said now this he said because every decision of god is perfect he cannot once his word is once spoken it can never die it can never die there's a life in his words look what he says he says now he said that he could never die it lives on and on never dies because why because it's god his word is eternal god is eternal is that right he's a supernatural god he made man in his image is that right he was a superman from the beginning is that right god made him in his image and his likeness because god wanted to do what god wanted to be worshipped is that right look at the hebrew definition we wrote down here beginning he said in the beginning god wanted to be worshipped he said now jesus he said now what if i if i be lifted up from the earth then i'll draw all men unto me look at the hebrew definition if you're writing it down you could go home and check is the hebrew translation is 7 2 18 just bear with me in your strong 72 25 and what he said is what is first what is the beginning the beginning is was first he said that christ the head of the body he says high high he's in authority is that right it's jesus christ he said the source now but it also is the beginning the beginning is your source and your origin amen again you see to lift up the head to restore through what to restore the position okay he was saying that now just bear with me he said now look john said in the beginning was the word the word was god the word was with god and the word was made flesh is that right he said that was the beginning and with his eternal purpose came on over was made flesh and dwelt among us what was it it was god's word is that right in the beginning god was made those that's that's john chapter 1 1 and 14. he says in the beginning was the word the word became flesh is that right so now when the word came on this earth here the word was sent for a purpose is that right so when the logos went out and that little light came down that you see over brother branham's head is that right he came down and small and dwelling what in each and every one of us is that right so that's where he's dwelling that now in the hearts of mankind he said now so out of the heart the abundance does the what the mouth speaketh is that right so god's down in in your heart he got down they put that seed there before the foundation of the world hallelujah let us keep going he said now what the voice of god is perfect we went over that so if a man if you get there and you say something wrong we're not like god we don't own this earth we got five contacts see taste fill smell and hear so we can contact this earthly body is that right so we know it is our enough then the holy spirit been telling us some people think they don't have the holy ghost and some people think they have the holy ghost you don't have the holy ghost is that right but you don't have to worry about it god promised he's not going to lose not a one is that right we're going to show you the mystery the mysteries that you're sitting under why you think the devil was fighting us and want to fight the pastor and say you don't need you don't need a whole mysteries why they need all those mysteries now why because god promised it and god's word is perfect and so the true seed wants it they want every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god that's what he said is that right hallelujah look what he's telling us so in this hour here now in the bride so how do you get back you do something wrong you just repent huh don't make it difficult just repent and you're back in the will of god is that right devil want to beat you and make you think you don't have the holy ghost that's not true huh huh it's there we all know you're going to make mistakes things are going to happen is that right hallelujah but the bible word is what it's eternal is that right he said it's up to god to it's up to god to make a place for me is that right i know that it's up to god to furnish a place for me if he told us we have to go a certain way then it's up to god to do it so what he's saying in proverbs 3 he said lean not to your own understanding trust in the lord in all thy ways and he will lead and he will guide and he will direct your path is that right we have to just keep fighting the good fight of faith is that all right and you're recognizing this album but god said all you have to do is what acknowledge him in all thy ways is that right then the holy spirit tell us that sunday morning all you want to do is talk about the goodness of the lord around the devil tell the devil what jesus christ did for you on calvary tell him what jesus christ how he shed his blood tell how jesus christ is the healer tell them how jesus christ is the savior tell him how he's the lord of lord the king of kings and the prince of peace talk about jesus let's talk about jesus [Music] i heard the pastor say the price on the gas things out there is going up people losing stocks this is our time to say let me tell you about jesus let me tell you about keep your mind steadfast on things above is that right not worrying about the things here on earth don't worry about the job god said we got to pay tithes is that right did i tell us then that means god will get you a job huh hey what are you wearing about a job for [Applause] huh hallelujah we got a good god i don't have that sister saying the song sunday good god always good the goodness of god huh he said now look what he say about over here he says now god has to furnish the place for us let's turn to john chapter 10. like i said we have many scriptures better get my scriptures in here because last time i was here my time live up i'm not going to keep you long don't worry it's wednesday pray pray with me he said now what i said john 10 hallelujah and let's look at verse 25. he said now look he said let me read this here he says i believe if god be the sovereign god as he is the eternal one he has to see it see to it it's up to him if i want if i want to go to heaven to his place it's up to him to furnish me a place where i know what to do is that right huh you're sitting in a place that god has provided for you in this hour here now is that right you're sitting under the word we're going to show you we have the justification and sanctification of baptism of the holy ghost we have the first pull second pull third paul you're sitting down in the opening of the opening of the word is that right some thought that during the pentecostal restoration ages that right that was going to be it no no no no the latter ain't couldn't come until the teaching reign had to come is that right so now we're looking look up your redemption is so near saints because you see now after there's going to be an explosion in his bride is that right god is making sure he's done restoring his word back to us now he's bringing us bringing us about to what to lift is that right live for life lies in that tongue he's telling you now when they was in tormented they tore me in because what he was spoke on their self is that right why did he say touch my what let me have a drop of water is that right that's my scorching tongue hallelujah that was a nugget hit in there why because now we're getting he rejecting what the water of the world he rejected the word that was brought to him that would have kept him out of hell when jesus said uh we know what you did in your religious spirits but you got one thing to do is what sell all your goods and give your riches to the poor he couldn't do it is that right so he ended up in hell is that right those that are rejecting the word in his hour here now they're not going to get away well i don't want to get ahead of myself i want you to see this he wants you to see him say what the lord is really doing for us how much he loves us how much he's opening his word is that right you tell you he said now look he says this is it he said now this is i know what to do wherever that you can lay your hands and say this is it do you believe this is it this is that's right brother oh yeah this is it is that right because it's producing what the opening of the word now the thing that was hidden there for you before the foundation of the world he said now look what he says he says jesus answered them i told you and ye believe not the works that i do in my father's work name it said they bear what witness of me he says but ye believe not because ye are not of my what sheep as i said unto you we're going to keep rolling we're going to show you there is those seeds out there that's heading to hell is that right so there's a torment help me lord he said now look drop down to 37 and verse 37 and 38 jesus was telling them see if if i do not the works of my father believe me not he says but if i do though ye believe not me believe the works that ye may know and believe that the father is in me and i in him is that right so that's the same we got greater is he that is in thee before what he put the seed in us before the foundation of the world is that right are we going to get to that's why he said put on your whole armor of god still with me now you put on your whole armor of god which is all the word so that you may be able to withstand against the wilds and the trickery of the devil in his time here is that right so now but the word has to be warned by the holy spirit isn't that right we're going to we want to get to that but we want you to see what god is bringing us into in his hour and it's so simple the mysteries are so simple to a believer but it's confounding the ones that's just looking right at it because it's not for them let me keep going he said now look help me lord god had the first he said now today now today we know we're living in a hybrid time it's a really high breaded time you got all these things that's being hybrid out here the food the plants you got all these uh animals you got these things being hydrated out here now it's the same source with the words the words out here is being hybrided but god has given us the spoken word the original word god has given us so you just bear awareness and the spoken word is the original seed it's the original seed keep that in mind as soon as that word the word of god we're going to look at that parable so we had to bring the original back to what it was what it was in the beginning in the beginning was the word when the word was spoken the word created the heaven the the heaven moved in firmament the word did those things is that right that's why we're moving you into the word if you want someone to pray for you and lay hands on you that's fine is that right but jesus demonstrated the spoken word in the in the gospel is that right when many came to him when the woman with the issues of blood is that right he healed the body by the way the spoken word is that right and jairus's daughter he healed her by the spoken word is that right the saturn servant he healed them by the spoken word is that right that was for the gentile that was a sign for the gentiles we're late we'll pray for you but as he spoke these words then the holy ghost fell upon you we're moving into something you got to receive you believe that that you have your healings if you believe that the word is the infallible if you believe the spoken word is going to do what it's supposed to do you got it always in genesis is that right god's word cannot change let there be light there was light the same word jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever the spoken word is the original seed we're moving it to the spoken word he said now look he said because every everything that we have and those that write it down i'm in paragraph 77 it says in everything that we have on earth today in its original form it came from the spoken word huh that's where it came from let's turn to hebrew three i mean hebrews right 11. everything came from the spoken word [Music] hallelujah chapter 11 and let's look at verse three hallelujah i'll start at verse one one and read down to three he says now faith is the substance of things hoped for for the evidence of things not seen he says for by it the elders obtain a good report he said through what faith we understand that the worlds ah were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear it's all by faith is that right that's why we're saying we were in the mind of god abraham's staggering not at the promises god but he grew stronger and stronger in faith at the what the promises of god hallelujah he said now look he said through faith we understand everything was framed he said that's that's what he says now you look at it let's prove it let's turn over to matthew 20 we got 24 35 he says and then you read down there verily verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things will be fulfilled you see heavens and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away now now you see why the holy spirit is getting you to move and speaking the word because you're going to find out the word seed and once the holy spirit comes down in your life now in that german sea dermatitis seed that's down there in your soul what is it now it has to be watered is that right that's why the teaching has to come the first teaching that jesus taught was you must be born again that was the doctrine that he told him everyone couldn't be born again is that right that's why when they asked him into intellectually how can a man be born enter his mother's womb again what we're looking at here is that now god was telling them he must be born again of the what of the water and of the what spirit hallelujah since since that scripture came up let me read this to you what the prophet said about that help me lord we want you to see this i don't want to rush i figured i was going to do it like a sunday school lesson because it's uh god help the word of me now look look at it right here if you're taking the notes and like i said i don't have the board a pair or a powerpoint but it's on um chapter 122 in the uh spoken word of the original seed he says his word is his seed his spirit is the water he says now right to john 3 14. we getting it right from the scriptures i don't have it like the prophet saying i mean like the pastor said line right up with it he got a board up they could show you now you just got to write it down and go home and read it is that now look he said there you get it again you see the spirit lifts the water is the spirit is the water he says now look at john 3 14 we understand what it means he says as moses lifted up the brass serpent in the wilderness so must the son of man be lifted up that's why i said in the beginning if you do your homework you go to bring up beginning the hebrew translation of beginning is lifted up jesus came to lift up god he let them know he was worshiping he said i do nothing unless the father show it to me is that right in the name he said i come in my wife my father's name is that right so now in the name of jesus there's salvation in the name of jesus this healing in the name of jesus is his deliverance in the name of jesus so now we bring it that's the word is that right let me finish let me take my time i want you to see what the prophet was saying here it had to be something important he was showing him this was his purpose he believed this was the purpose he came here he had to battle those denominations those organizations and he he split this message up with two three hours on once in the first part and three hours on the second part he was getting the point you go you study this is so much i'm not even touching the surface of it he said you look he says now as moses lifted up the bad serpent in the wilderness so must the son of man be lifted up he said see if moses lifted up the brass serpent for the same cause christ was lifted up remember they was there in the wilderness and it was out there and they got the merman and complaining is that right you think the holy ghost don't tell us who mermaid ain't complaining you can marry me and complain you better stay away from that mixed multitude huh that was the mixed multitude that was with them that started murmuring and complaining trying to pull the righteous man away from their blessing telling them you don't need these mysteries and things and that like that huh then you know dig in it because there was a mixed multitude let me keep going he said now what is it moses lifted up the brass serpent and so that the people that was perishing might have water for life huh how did he get the breast serpent they knew moses had to do what they repented to moses is that right then moses went and prayed and when moses got there and prayed that water they'd have to what they needed a word is that right they had to have a word from the prophet when the word had to come from the prophet of god so we have to line it up with the scriptures so moses was that what he was the pastor to the world to the age at that time see william marion brandon is the pastor to this age is that right huh he's a pastor to this age but he's coming to show them that what christ was back on the scene is that right remember he was telling us what you're getting had to what you're getting had to come let me read this to you just just struck me amen it came of the resume this out of the resume of the church ages he said now look here god help me get over there and he says uh and for the sake of time so you can understand and those that are looking in and visitors you can understand we're not just lifting up a man he was the prophet that was sent to the age that's why the pastor tell you to go tell them about christ go out and tell them about the word go tell them about these hidden nuggets and then seed is going to ask you anyway is that right they gonna ask you then you let them know about malachi 4. luke 17 30. revelations 10 7. is that right he said now this age started just after the turn of the 20th century he says as it was beginning the age with the true church which turned being what the bride she was at pentecost she know that there must in the necessity be a return of the what of the dynamic power he's got to come he said the believer says this in their spirits and the believer see you're sensing it in your spirit he said if you sensing it in in their spirits begin crying to god for a new outpouring such as was in the first century bear with me now he said what seemed to be the answer such as was in the first he said came as many began to speak in tongues manifest the gifts of the spirit and it was believed that this was indeed the long-awaited restoration this is what they thought it was supposed to be but it wasn't is that right because the devil was still hiding in pentecost is that right so when you come up and sitting up in here you're trying to bring over where you come from but you i'm getting ready to read something to you you won't be able to hide that's why the pastor was saying sunday morning he's not rebuking you it's like the eagle stirs her nest he's shaking those loose leaves off of you is that right he glad now you're moving into the eagle food is that right you're moving it to the manifestation of the sons and the daughters of god this word is more powerful and this only word that can protect you from any kind of bomb that they make out there is that right hide me in the craft of the rock the cleft was the whole you're a new creature in christ jesus huh there's no condemnation that can come against you walk not after the flesh but after the spirit hallelujah look what he says he says now it was not it was not it was just restoration it was not the latter rain can come only after the former rain which is the spring or the what teaching ring ah let it sink in see what god given you with god bringing you and how could this be the real thing when the teaching reign had not come he said the prophet messenger who was to be sent to teach the people and turn the hearts of the children back to the pentecostal fathers he said we're looking at so we're bringing you in to now is the teaching that's coming down god is come with malachi 4 to tie in tie up all the loose things is that right open all the mysteries is that right so now is christ back on the scene in the holy ghost spirit form open the word to each and every one of us help me lord let me keep going he said now look he says now what is moses lifted up the brass serpent and so the people that was perishing might have water for life he says jesus jesus is the word of god he said now we're going to laminate down he said jesus is the word of god and he was burned and he was burst open that life still with me now he says the life is inside the seed huh you got that seed inside of you you've got the life of god inside of you you've got christ inside of you you're [Music] let me keep going he said look he says now jesus is the word the life is in the seed that this life which is spirit water flowing over it says water flowing over the spirit over the seed of god it will bring forth the life of the seed still with me just bury me with me now the spirit of the holy ghost when it comes now it comes when it comes down in there when you come in here it's something you're looking for and it's something you enter in his gates with thanksgiving because you know you're going to receive what you need if you're in the right place is that right so that's why the worship service has to be in order they has to be in order but because so god so the story can be pleasing to the holy spirit and when it is pleasing to the holy spirit and then the holy spirit will come down and word in the word of the seed is that right now is someone this is we have been praying remember a testimony the last time we were saying when where last time i was here i was saying that when were left we've seen someone slain and rejoicing and delivered in the spirit is that right when the god used our sister that's visiting to sing that song the holy ghost was pleased the folks came down they started getting slaying rejoicing screaming and hollering when you got to singing the song when our brother seth was singing the song they started singing and rejoicing and replacing so god showed me that all we have to do is keep the order and the holy ghost is pleased [Music] [Applause] then he comes down and water that seed that's inside of you what you need what you expecting what you come expecting he'd come in and he'll order it for you is that right because he's pleased and now they rejoice the praises go up the blessings come down look what he said help me lord he says now the seed he said will bring forth the life of the seed and if it brings forth some and if it brings forth something else there's some other kind of seed there well i ain't calling you serpent seed but i'm just reading what he said you either got a fail you either got a faith scene or you got a doubt see down in there is that right you're here because god you got the right seed inside of you no man can come to me unless who the father draw you so god drew you here is that right you just keep speaking it testifying telling them whatever you pray for if you have migraine headaches testified deliverance of your migraine headaches if you got backache testify your delivery of your backache if you've got feedback testify your deliverance of your feeling if you have this child all the demons that's troubling you testify your healing is that right because the lord said with these stripes you are here is that right blessed be the name of the lord so who had the arm of the lord been revealed to whom had believed thy report the arm of the lord had been revealed to who believe the report do you believe you're in the right place do you believe that christ is there give him the praise give him love give him the glory he's the one that deserved it all [Music] the spoken word is the original see that ah [Music] honey it's inside of you whatever you're buying on earth you'll be buying in heaven whether you loose on earth shall be loose in heaven the condition has nothing to do with the promise of the conclusion it has nothing to do with it don't look at it with your natural eye is that right god came around in it when god spoke that word let me keep going help me lord he said look he said now he says produce the life he says it's the water god's spirit if the spirit of god comes forth to water the seed if it's the seed it's watering it'll produce the life of the seed see see how simple it is you just have to believe that the seed is inside of you that's all you have to do you just have to believe that is there i am bride i am going in the rapture i believe this word up i'm looking for is coming i know who i am i know where i come from i know what you promised me i know what i'm getting setting up in here i can stand on that teaching i can stand on the word of god [Applause] don't be afraid to speak it huh it's your promise [Music] [Applause] the spoken word is the original seed of god ain't no hybrid ain't no hybrid you haven't been born again for the word of another spirit every word you can say ain't meant to you see speak the word they're like god god gonna bring you when you see fit you just stand on it keep confessing it is that right [Applause] hallelujah he gave us the sign he vindicated us to sign is that right stay away from the negativity i heard the holy ghost say sunday morning the holy ghost is positive huh [Applause] we got got the house he just didn't make good he made what very good in the beginning he was in his mind you were an attribute he saved the best for last now he's getting ready to manifest he's getting ready to bring up the path before we leave out of here we have to get this teaching we have to get this teaching before what that rain come that ladder rain come he said now look he says the word the the i believe the bible is the word the whole truth and jesus is the word manifest and he he and his word is one and the same what was he now look let's turn to john 17 the gospel of john john 17. let me give you some scriptures so you want to get around there and say ah brother kelly let's see because the bible said that every man would be a liar like god's be true he said let's look at 17-3 uh for the sake of time we're going to jump around chapter 17. now we know this here is what the lord's prayer when christ is talking about the lord's prayer is that right he said now look he says and this is this is life eternal that they might know the the only true god and jesus christ whom whom thou has sent he said now have verse 4 i have glorified thee on the earth i have finished the work which thou gavers me to do he said o man o father glorified like me with thy own self with the glory i had with thee when before the lord he said let us let us only want to remember back there is christ is that right ah so now that we christ see that we are with him also is that right it's the seed of christ that's inside of you it's being water the works that i do you shall do also [Music] he said look he said verse six he said i have manifested thy name unto the men he says which thou gavers me out of the world he says done they were and thou gave us them me and they had what kept thy word kept thy word is that right brother steve i pray for you we all want to keep praying for you by any devil that's come against you because it's a famine in the land of hearing the word you ought to be blessed to be thankful for what you're getting you're getting because you're pulling and you're pulling and that's why god is blessing you continue to pour don't get caught up with the mixed multitude help me lord that's what it's all about the word it's the word of god in the beginning was the word don't you want to hear about your father the word was god the word was with god and the word was made flesh quit your thinking like men you got to stop thinking like god we just pass them through you don't have to fear no devil one of them double shot jesus coming in there that was in the pigs you come to torment us before our time huh spoken word huh cast them demons out of them pigs is that right by the what by the spoken word is that right all they wanted to hear was a word is that right they were too late for the rich young ruler right it was too late for him the word came to him is that right even the woman that was living ill fame that they wanted to stone her to death is that right they wanted a stone head of death and they knew they were coming up but they didn't know they was coming up against the world the anointed word eye for the day of this hour the supernatural anointed word for this hour here now god has brought in us and when they brought her they knew they were supposed to have a witness is that right the word can't offend the word so we got them they were supposed to bring a witness is that right but they missed it and jesus wrote in the same and said what he have not sinned do what cast the first stone when he looked up they were what they were going is that right they're going to be right there with that young rich ruler because the ill-fating woman that was struggling in her life she brought him to eternal life and they walked away from eternal life is that right that just like ray had she was packing right what the spies needed is that right a woman prostitute living on the wall but she recognized that god was with him she was not only concerned about herself you want to see someone that truly got the holy ghost he said she said i'm not going to help you unless you help my father my mother my brother my sister you see that's someone with the holy ghost who's living for others is that right he said look what he said look at verse 5 he says oh that father thyself drop down the verse i'ma jump a little bit verse six he says i have manifest thy name unto the men which thou has gave us out of the world he says none they were and thou gave us them me and they have kept thy word god bless you he said now look let's go to verse 8 for i have given unto them he says the words which thou gave it to me and they have received them you see glory be to god ah it can't be love could probably because christ don't pray for you is that right he doesn't pray for you he don't pray to the father you're the testimony you're the christ seed that was hiding in there he gave you the road test and you received the word you kept on the word you're standing on the word for your day is that right hallelujah he said now look help me lord he says for i have given unto them the words which thou gaveth me and they have received them and have surely surely that i came out from thee and they have believed that thou this what sent me glory be to god you believe and you know this message come from god god send a vindicated prophet is that right he sent him to recognize he was the one that came and got vindicated to the whole world and let them see the pillar of fire that a man in the world in a stadium 1950 is that right vindicated this was his servant and they he didn't even want to go down there and fuss with them but god gave him grace to go down in there why because god had a hidden nugget in the nugget that god hid down in there he wanted the whole world to see this is my servant this is malachi 4 this is luke 17 30. revelation 19. is that right he's our receiver prophet receive a prophet's reward [Music] help me lord he said the believers down this he says i prayed for them i pray not for the world hallelujah but for them which thou has given me for they are thine help me lord i'm gonna drop down a little bit so we can jump a little bit look at the enemy they are dying and are mine and i am glorified in them thank you jesus and now i am no more in the world but these are in the world and i come to thee holy father keep through thine own name those who thou has given me that they may be one as what we are one is that right now god's molding you when the holy ghost come you become one you become partnership with god finish the plan of redemption we walk in the life the character that's inside of us each day he's molding us and molding us more and more like him is that right because you're going to be the spoken word he's giving us grace when he came down suddenly start telling you about that tongue and start talking about the lip and the mouth he showed us life and death lies in the what in the tongue is that right god hid these things from us so now saints do you have to realize the heart is changing the heart is that all you have to do is repent what is repentance someone out there tell them about the good news you say you just got to repent young lady you just got to turn to christ what is it to return from your ways it's a changed heart and a changed mind you no longer have a desire to do the things that you once did let us keep going help me lord he said now look he says wild verse he says verse 12 while i was with them now verse 13 he says and now come i thee and these things i speak in the world that they might have my one joy for in themselves i have given them thy what word and the world have hated them because they are not of the one of the world he says now look even as i am not of the world he says of glory he said i pray not that thou should take them out of the world but that thou should keep them from the what evil now if the spoken word walking in the flesh showed us as an example what he did now if someone in your family that's struggling with something you pray for them you keep them up in prayer because your prayer is just as powerful as jesus prayer the same prayer because you're becoming one you've got a father that's struggling you got a mother that's struggling you got a brother that's struggling your brother you got a child that's struggling you got a husband that's struggling hold him up in prayer jesus know that his prayer would be answered jesus no because he proved it and he testifying that your prayer was going to be answered and stand in the gap with someone you know why because you received the word they received the word they received the word he said now look look at verse 17 he says sanctify them through thy what truth thy word is truth let's drop down to 23 for the sake of time in them and thou in me that may be made what in what ah ah huh brother robert the holy the holy ghost revealed that sunday morning ah how is he perfect he said they received the word ah is that right you receive the word you keep receiving the word that makes you one with god in the beginning was the word the word was god the word was with god the word was made flesh now if you truly truly truly believe it the holy ghost would come down and anoint it is that right and what are the words and he'll unfold more and more to you let me keep going i'm trying to get to somewhere he says thou has sent me and has loved them as thou has loved me he said now look jesus was the seed jesus was the seed that eve had produced is that right that the eve should have produced that was the seed it was going to be that's why we say the spoken word was the original seed is that right let's turn it back to luke eight let me show you luca luke 8 and we're about to round it down because i know by the grace of god it's wednesday and we thank god for his grace and and and his mercy let me see where that was help me lord yeah luke 8 and i tell you what let's uh of course for the sake of time let's look at uh five first five i think it was well let's start at verse 4. he says now look help me lord he says and his disciples answered him from hints and the man said no i don't want to go there let's drop down to um 10. okay i'm in mark i'm sorry i'm in mark i'm in mark hallelujah okay here we go thank you jesus let's look at four he says and when and when much people were gathered together and would come to him out of every city and and musicians shouldn't come forth he said and much people were gathered together and would come to him out of every city he says he spake a parable he said the sower went out to sow the what the seed and as he sowed and fell upon the wayside and tried them down and the fowls of the air and devoured it he said now look now remember the prophet of god worked this here he was working it in the same message but he was just showing how the denominations and the organizations just come and steal the word out of it people trying to bring their organization thinking their organization teaching they're trying to bring it over until the unadulterated words it's not going to work that's right brother it's not it's not going to work and that's why i don't have time to go to all that you have to pull it up and and and look in it he was working and he was showing them this is what was taken from they was trying to bring the traditions in their ways and their teachings that's why jesus said you must have been what born again born of the water in the spirit and so the water in the spirit because why in the time now the first doctrine that he brought you is because it was only for the original seed the original seed is the only one that can be born again here you see hallelujah let's keep going he says now look at verse nine jump over here to verse nine he says and his disciples asked him said and said what might be this parable be he said and he said unto it it is given to know the what ah ah i thought the mysteries were just in the seven cells i thought the mission was just in the church huh why'd the prophet keep talking about the gospel why the brother branham always would bring the gospel the preaching of the cross it's foolishness to a man that powers but his power until a man is saved roll the blood roll the blood the blood of god has signed my name it can't be taken off god signed my name [Music] god said it let it be so the spoken word is the original seed of god we're getting back to the original [Music] the miracle he said all such faith jesus saw the faith even though he was not yet sent to the gentiles gentile but he's seen how great faith the gentiles had they would just receive the word because why because they recognized god was on the scene [Music] it was god came down in the body that's why you young ladies when you have a baby when the baby gets to be about six months and then to start moving start singing songs to that baby huh reading scriptures to that baby blaming that baby world of light talk to him because it hears and it'll calm down if you sing a good christian song to that baby it'll be comfort why because gee we have a high priest that cannot can be touched by the feelings of what our infirmities is that right he planted the seed the word seed and what was planted in mary is that right he knows everybody infirmities he knows what you go through having a child because he was inside of that body is that right jesus so let it be help me lord he said now look he said look he says unto you it is given to know the what the mysteries of the kingdom of god he says but to others in parables that seeing they what see not and the hearing that they might what you know brother branham said that was the mystery he said that mystery was the opening of that word it was the word they couldn't receive the word so he brought it to him in parables but you could receive the word now you see why the devil don't want you to get these mysteries huh the opening of this word and want to rush and say go home and say you don't need these things huh let me read god help me if i can i can read it to you what he said help me lord he said now help me jesus when he worked that he said that's the that was the mystery the mystery was then when the opening of the word came they couldn't receive it he says now the reproduction god help me he said he was he was that seed that eve should have produced he says he was the seed that he was produced but but the hybrid believing i read that already help me lord here's the word he says the word seed but god there is a germ life come from the real seed that god proved it was his seed he proved it was a seed when he what when he rose again out of that grave now in the resurrected christ he's living here again look what he says he says now unto you it is unto you it is given it's given it's given it's given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of god he said but to others it's parables that sin they might not see and hearing that they might not understand he says now the parable is this the seed is the what the word of god may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word hallelujah let me stop let me stop i'll tell you i tell you saints i don't know which way to go brother steve when the holy ghost opened that up when the holy ghost opened that up sunday morning i tell you i i i tell you i'm just sitting there and sitting there and sitting there just looking and the holy ghost just kept opening and kept opening you go look into that message now since when he opened up sunday morning that spoken word the original seed is going to be a new life to you let us bow our heads hallelujah thank you jesus thank you father lord god we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy thank you lord god for touching my body lord god because you know lord god what it was what it was going through but i give you praise i give you on i'll give you glory lord

name of the lord how many enjoy the service tonight [Music] amen hallelujah brother sam i can't wait for you to be here amen i can't wait for you to be here so you feel what we all feel here and sometimes it's strong it's a very very strong anointing in this place amen wow you know brother branham was a professional very very professional to even try to preach the spoken word is the original seed in six hours do you know what brother branham spoke about the seals do you know brother branham say if he preached one seal he will preach a three month so he preached it in one service so what is in there part one part two part three part four he said three months how many parts he he takes a message and preached six hours and brother kelly you want to jump into that hallelujah you're going to be shooting everywhere because of the the the material that is in there it is so rich so powerful amen that you can barely touch the surface of what the prophet was trying to really bring out amen my god my god [Laughter] this word is something let's just stand let's stand before i get into something amen do you know when they say when god says something it doesn't change do you know what i mean do you know what i mean when they say when god says something it will be eternally true do you know why you know why right how many knows okay do you know why we call this eternity right amen eternity is like a circle you don't know where he start you don't know where he stopped it is like a ring he keep going eternity eternity and god and eternity blended together so when you look at god and eternity they are confused amen you don't know what is the beginning what is the end because melchizedek have no father no mother know what nor even water so when you look it's just you don't know where to start how can this man get that amen how can this man get that so inside this state that we call eternity this is where god program everything this is where god says brother rabbit amen will be married to [Music] sister lauren he gave that answer quick amen so when god says this he spoke this in eternity make sense so god before he comes up with this decision do you get it god search all eternity to see what is the problem that can block brother robert from getting married to sister laurel in eternity not in time does it make sense so in eternity god already searched and he searched his search and he programmed everything in eternity when he finished he seals the book and he take his stamp and he put it and he say but robert life is finished put it there on the shelf who's next [Music] is he helping you is he helping you why are you surprised about what happened to you why are you surprised do you want me to continue [Laughter] when he finished those decisions then god shrank make sense when he shrank he shrank into a pillar of fire right because there was no space eternity is just blocking him so he has to shrink now is left now he's god he can float now on eternity he's the pillar of fire right you remember when he did this he created a negative pressure which we call emptiness all right all right if you take this circle right here i hope you're getting it if you take this circle right here and you stretch it straight do you hear me did i lose somebody if you up if you break the circle here and you stretch it and you stretch it and you put it in a line do you hear me it becomes like this okay this is what science call negative two we okay now we okay now now this circle is stretched make sense okay then this negative pressure here okay if you want to put it on this line what it does it does a loop like this this loop is a negative loop where we call time make sense make sense okay so everything that we are here is ready everything that happened to you here your birth you're growing you're going to school everything is happening here about here you remember brother chad sermon and brother branham say one of this day when we finish god will take this loop and pull the rub back up and then we back again too do you see what happened but your decision here was not taken here okay your decision was taken here okay so when god said brother rabbit will get married to sister gloria he was in eternity right so when god take this decision and bring it here god cannot change this one is 1949 1946 1950 2001 2003 it have nothing to do with this so god cannot bring a new decision because this is like a perversion right his decision was taken in perfection so god cannot bring something if something is already perfect what else can you do to that which is perfect what else it's something that is not perfect that you're trying to make perfect but the decision of god was taken when he was perfect amen that's why god when he spoke he doesn't change anything when he spoke his word is spoken in eternity eternity means he already looked at everything the whole story so when brother robert enter here in time okay you can take brother robert and put him in australia you can take sister royal you get her way way way down in south america amen this condition here have no obstacle to eternity hallelujah hallelujah so it's just a matter of time anybody here when the time of marriage come even if there is corona virus even if they close their borders are you there the laws of nature will give away that this decision will always have to happen are you there god will open up a certain way for sister royal to meet brother robert somehow are you there that's why when god said something you catch it amen because it would not change that's why he said heaven and earth shall not pass away but this word here whatever i have in my mind when he spoke before he spoke he's gonna look he say what is brother robert problem but robert problem is gonna be this one two three he said okay if it's gonna be one two three i need to give him something stronger than three but the robert is gonna made in caliber five then he sent brother rabbit so when brother robert come to the world when you put one he just knock it that's why he cannot give you any trial beyond your caliber that caliber was already measured it was measured in eternity so when you're coming if there is an obstacle your caliber is different than brother evil caliber and you gonna knock it down even though you feel like this is too much it is not too much he cannot put something in you without you being able to knock at him amen that is why the word the word the word the word is important and god created the world by them if god spoke who can stop him amen who can stop him do you know what he was trying to do to the uh roman centurion do you know he wanted to go lay hand right right the laying on hand delaying on hand i'm going to let you go home he's a jewish faith [Music] amen he was trying to get a jewish faith and pull it introduce it to the gentler and they don't say stop you're forgetting something you're forgetting something over there they need to touch your hand they need to touch your clothes the hem of your garment we don't need those things we just need though we are interested in because we understand authority authority doesn't lie on touching clothes he doesn't lie on laying hand he lies in there that's why jesus said ouch i remember i remember this kind of thing is not in israel what is the purpose of the message then you got your answer is the message complicated if i continue we're going to stay here longer when he mentioned about the the the the woman that was caught in adultery what brought that woman to jesus have you thought about it can i give you homework what brought her to jesus do you know what brought her to jesus somebody will say it's adultery correct can i help you with something else open galatian 3 sorry my brother you the one causing all of this you heard brother sam in other words blaming on me galatians 3 24. sorry brother kelly you started you see that did you see galatian 3 do you see 24 can somebody read it the lord did what wherefore the law was what to do what to what let me stop who brought the woman to christ they bought her based on water and they didn't know that the law was made to bring us to who and when they bring the predestinated say to christ what does christ do you thought you're gonna corner me see how the devil thought he caught you in sin [Music] born in sin shaping iniquity coming into the world speaking lies down low the ordinance that was condemning you that the devil keep reminding you of you remember what you did in 1949 you remember what you did in 1950 you remember what you did in 2000 it was that that brought you [Music] and when you come to christ with that condition you make christ more potent because jesus christ said the sick only search for the doctor if you are not sick his medication doesn't work good because you're healthy so the more sick you are the more powerful you can sense his medication and when you sense his medication you say ah that medication really really work and you can tell somebody if they got sick you said go to that doctor i remember the prescription he gave me that prescription really really working me all things work together for depending on your origin god richly bless you brother kelly already prayed for you to go home brother lead us with one song then we can go home may god bless you and protect you you can lead us with one song and you can go home you don't have anything to be worried in this christian life the deed of all all for you amen go ahead whatever [Music] the original life the original sin the original word is [Applause] the original sea let's do that again is [Applause] is we are the word made flesh today this is what the scriptures say and our names are seen and inspired by our god [Applause] is [Applause] [Music] is [Applause] responded to our god the original last sing it as you're dismissed this evening is [Applause] adoption [Applause] how is
