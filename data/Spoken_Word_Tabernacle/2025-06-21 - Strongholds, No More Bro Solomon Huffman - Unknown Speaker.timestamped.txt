[30:28] just want to give this testimony cuz uh
[30:31] I believe it wasn't a coincidence. Amen.
[30:34] Amen. Um so I came here yesterday
[30:39] um sat down and waiting for the
[30:42] inspector to come and um do his normal
[30:45] inspections on on our building. And
[30:48] whilst I was sitting um the one who was
[30:51] scheduled to come wasn't picking our
[30:53] phone calls, he wasn't answering our
[30:55] messages, nothing. Um the time that he
[30:58] gave to us, he he didn't show up. So,
[31:02] whilst I was sitting there,
[31:04] I was just pondering over the building
[31:06] project.
[31:08] And then um something just uh struck my
[31:11] heart. Amen.
[31:13] And I was like, God, you're going to
[31:16] bless somebody to give us like $20,000
[31:21] just to support this project.
[31:24] So, while that was going on, I was like,
[31:27] you know what? I can multiply that by 10
[31:29] times.
[31:30] So my mind went to $200,000.
[31:35] Amen. So I I I believe that God is able
[31:39] to to do it. Amen.
[31:42] And then um when inspect a different
[31:45] person showed up here to do the
[31:47] inspection and then to our surprise he
[31:49] just passed us for everything and then
[31:52] asked us to go on with the project.
[31:54] Amen. were not really expecting that but
[31:57] he just looked at things and then said
[31:59] just go ahead and do it. Amen. So that
[32:02] in itself was a praise report. Amen.
[32:06] But then the striking thing Amen. Two
[32:10] inspections. Two inspections were
[32:13] passed. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[32:17] The striking thing was that when I left
[32:20] this place,
[32:22] a a a brother sent me a message.
[32:26] Amen. Now remember the number was two
[32:30] 20,000 and 200,000. Right? So the
[32:34] brother sent me a message and I'm not
[32:36] going to uh mention his name. Amen.
[32:39] I said, "God bless you, brother Seth. I
[32:41] believe you're doing well." said, "I
[32:43] have a praise report for you to read on
[32:46] Wednesday that I know you will love.
[32:50] I want to thank God for allowing me to
[32:53] find some money that I lost this week."
[32:58] After almost 5 and a half hours, I was
[33:03] able to go back to QT and check through
[33:07] their dumpster.
[33:09] And after about three or four garbage
[33:13] bags, I was able to recover the $2,000
[33:18] that I accidentally threw into one of
[33:21] their garbage cans earlier.
[33:27] Do you know what I did with the money? I
[33:30] gave it to the church building fund
[33:34] to help with the projects in the back
[33:36] and the side of the church. All praises
[33:39] be to our God.
[33:49] And then he continued to say, they said,
[33:52] "Make sure you let brother Steven know
[33:54] too. I know he will be happy to see me
[33:57] mixing faith with works."
[34:00] [Applause]
[34:03] Amen. And amen. Amen. So, this was me
[34:08] pondering over somebody being touched by
[34:10] the Lord to give 20,000 and the Lord
[34:13] gave a token of $2,000. And I believe
[34:17] that the Lord himself is the builder of
[34:20] this church project.
[34:27] Amen. And amen and amen. Amen. So it's
[34:31] just something I just wanted to share
[34:33] with the church that no matter the
[34:36] challenges we are facing, the Lord
[34:38] himself is the master builder. Amen.
[34:41] Amen and amen. Amen.
[34:45] Um apart from that praise report. Amen.
[34:48] Uh I don't have any other praise report
[34:50] tonight. Amen.

[35:13] have a lot to say. Amen. But um I just
[35:18] want to keep I just want to keep it not
[35:20] to say too much. Amen. We all know we
[35:23] all understand what I want to say. Amen.
[35:25] Amen. U so we we want to call brother
[35:29] Khalima amen um to thank the Lord for
[35:32] our lives and to thank the Lord for a
[35:34] finished project

[35:46] Let's all stand. What a wonderful
[35:49] testimony. Let's bow our heads.

[36:26] Steven.
[36:28] Dear Jesus, she's the one that cooks for
[36:30] him. She's the one that, oh, Father God,
[36:33] washes his clothes, keep the house clean
[36:36] so that your minister can do the work.
[36:39] Oh, Father God, study. She watches over
[36:42] the children. There's many things that
[36:44] we can say about our precious sister.
[36:46] May you bless her, oh father god, you
[36:49] know the desires of her heart. Lord, may
[36:52] you take each and every one of them. Now
[36:54] take this service, Father God, as we
[36:56] continue to bless thee, Lord. You see
[36:59] the building back there. Truly, truly,
[37:01] you are the one that have established
[37:04] this church and you are the one that's
[37:06] going to bring it through. There's no
[37:08] witchcraft,
[37:10] no enchantment.
[37:12] No divination,
[37:15] no devil, father God will stand in your
[37:18] way. Will stand in the way of your
[37:21] people on duty, Father. As Moses of old,
[37:25] the Red Sea was before him, Father. But
[37:28] it was a prophet who had a Oh, Father
[37:32] God, who had a work to do
[37:36] and you opened up the Red Sea for him.
[37:38] May you do the same for our soul, Father
[37:40] God. As we see these things, we want to
[37:42] bless your holy name. Take the tithes,
[37:44] the offering, Father God. Bless the
[37:47] giver, Lord Jesus. And those that desire
[37:49] to give, don't have, Father, may you
[37:50] place something in their hands, oh
[37:52] Father God, that they may worship thee
[37:54] in this way. Bless especially the
[37:56] ministering of your word. our precious
[37:58] brother when he stands here may might
[38:00] not be him father but may it be you
[38:03] father god I speak to your people and

[39:06] harsh
[39:08] and sweet
[39:10] [Music]
[39:11] of one who gave all he had for me.
[39:19] I felt the passion
[39:22] of
[39:24] his death
[39:26] and the forgiveness
[39:29] of his final breath.
[39:34] Now I can never
[39:37] be
[39:39] the same.
[39:41] My heart has been
[39:44] forever
[39:47] changed.
[39:49] I want to live
[39:52] and love and give the way he gave.
[39:59] [Applause]
[40:04] Now I'm giving my life
[40:08] away.
[40:13] Laying it down on the altar.
[40:18] Now I'm giving my life away.

[41:00] No sacrifice
[41:03] too much to make.
[41:07] No way of measuring
[41:11] the cost
[41:14] next to the blood of Calary's
[41:18] cross. Oh. So if I live, I live for him.
[41:27] Or if I die, I count it gain.

[51:33] the shout of the king is in the camp.
[51:37] Amen. We don't just have the Bible. We
[51:40] have the Bible and the message of the
[51:42] hour, which is the shout of the king.
[51:44] Amen. Oh, glory, glory, glory.
[51:48] Hallelujah. What an atmosphere. By the
[51:51] time I got here, the song service was

[52:02] precious name of our Lord and Savior
[52:04] Jesus Christ, both visible and invisible
[52:07] audience. Amen. Any new subscriber
[52:10] online, numbers keep coming up, going
[52:12] up. God richly bless you and welcome to
[52:14] Spoken Word Tabernacle and any family
[52:17] members here. God bless you. Josie, I
[52:20] saw you somewhere. God bless you. Good
[52:22] to see you, Josie. How are you doing?
[52:25] Amen. Amen. Amen. Good to see you.
[52:31] Praise God. Praise God. And welcome to
[52:34] spoken word convention on Wednesday.
[52:36] Amen. Now you see how God loves you that
[52:39] even somebody's praying something wrong
[52:41] toward you, God keep changing that. Look
[52:44] how many time Bum went to pray to pray
[52:46] to pray trying to curse somebody and God
[52:49] keep changing
[52:51] the curses into the blessing because he
[52:54] love Israel. And when I was reading the
[52:58] the scripture on Sunday where the Bible
[53:00] say and that people will rise up like a
[53:03] lion, he hit me on the pulpit but I left
[53:05] it alone. If you watch the news,
[53:09] Israel attack Iran
[53:13] and the attack of Israel toward Iran.
[53:16] Benjamin
[53:18] Nachau called that rising lion
[53:21] operation.
[53:26] So Benjamin is doing a rising lion
[53:28] operation.
[53:31] But the true lion.
[53:34] Yes, sir. I don't know if you my friend
[53:38] it is homegoing town. If you want to say
[53:41] stay in this world that's your problem.
[53:44] I'm getting ready to go. Pope Leo lion
[53:50] Benjamin Natanu rising lion operation
[53:54] and the lion is the second coming of the
[53:56] lord. So what do you think we are?
[54:00] If Benjamin is rising up, remember his
[54:03] name is Benjamin, which is 144,000 and
[54:07] he's working for the Jews. So if the
[54:09] Jews are rising
[54:11] as a lion, what about the bride of Jesus
[54:14] Christ?
[54:16] Amen. The one who will meet is not a
[54:19] lamb.
[54:21] Uh come on now. The one you will meet in
[54:25] the air is not a lamb. We will meet the
[54:28] lion because he's coming as the lion of
[54:31] the tribe of Judah. If he's a lion, then
[54:34] we are lion.
[54:41] My friend, it's homegoing time. If you
[54:44] look it, it's crazy all over the world.
[54:48] Amen. Now, Israel war with Hamas the
[54:51] hood is shooting. How can they kill so
[54:54] many I mean like 20 top military? What
[54:58] intelligence have Israel?
[55:01] It's even farther than the CIA.
[55:05] And if Israel have such intelligence
[55:09] [Applause]
[55:09] [Music]
[55:12] in the natural what intelligence has the
[55:16] bride?
[55:18] I don't know if you get it because
[55:19] brother Brandham said the eyes was the
[55:21] prophet. Yes. He says the mouth was the
[55:24] Pentecostal. Brother Brandham, we say we
[55:26] pass the eye. We are in the mind which
[55:30] is the intelligence which has been
[55:32] reflected by the coming of the cloud
[55:34] because the intelligence has come. So
[55:37] our intelligence even it's even superior
[55:40] than what Israel has because we have the
[55:43] supreme intelligence of God. Amen. Amen.
[55:49] [Laughter]
[55:52] Oh, glory to God. A minister, a minister
[55:56] made me laugh. He says, "Brother Steven,
[55:59] there is a a nuclear site in uh in
[56:02] Iran." It's all over the news. So, I'm
[56:05] not saying something like it's new.
[56:07] There's a nuclear site in Iran that is
[56:10] way deep, way deep, deep, deep into the
[56:13] into the mountain. So, there is nothing
[56:16] that can destroy it bunker bomb.
[56:20] And America is the only one that carry
[56:22] that because that one will go 90
[56:26] what me or 90 mile or whatever down and
[56:29] that's the only one that can destroy
[56:30] that once for all. And he said brother
[56:33] Steven
[56:34] evangelist can go and shoot other demon
[56:38] left and right but we need the teacher
[56:40] for the banker buster to get deep into
[56:44] the pen to penetrate the
[56:52] Hey, I didn't say that. I got this. I
[56:54] got the text. I'm just repeating the
[56:56] text. He said we need the teacher to go
[56:59] deeper into the and and and and enter
[57:03] the depths of Satan to bust everything
[57:06] down there. You see what God is doing
[57:09] with a purpose? It's releasing any
[57:11] tension because I know somehow there is
[57:14] a reason. There is a time, there is a
[57:17] season, and there is a purpose. Period.
[57:18] I'm going to sleep. Amen. Because no
[57:22] enchantment, no divination, nothing can
[57:24] do anything to Israel. Once you are in
[57:28] Christ, there is nothing nothing.
[57:32] Hallelujah. You will say, okay, you're
[57:34] saying that because it's a teacher.
[57:36] Yeah, I have the text. He send it to me.
[57:38] I'm just telling you what he sended to
[57:40] me. And I and I and I send him aside and
[57:43] I say bullseye. So sometime we need to
[57:45] go deep deep deep deep and get that
[57:47] stuff out because uh superficially
[57:49] you're just killing devils that fun you
[57:52] just destroying but it's on the surface.
[57:54] Sometime we need to go deep with a
[57:57] bunker buster bomb. It goes way deep and
[58:01] destroy everything. Amen. If you notice,
[58:05] I don't know if you noticed. Do you know
[58:06] where they killed
[58:08] uh uh I mean chief? They use a bustler
[58:12] banker bomb. He was way down. It looks
[58:14] like these folks built cities
[58:17] underground.
[58:21] So the only way to get them, you need to
[58:22] go underground.
[58:24] So if naturally the folks are
[58:26] underground,
[58:30] if you want to get the devil in this
[58:31] town,
[58:34] let's go deep. I already sent you the
[58:37] code, but I'm saying we need to learn
[58:38] deep. Let's go deep. Amen. Not just we
[58:42] cast out the devil and the devil come
[58:44] back. No, no, no, no. We need to go to
[58:46] the root and uproot everything. Amen.
[58:50] That's why John the Baptist said that
[58:51] the axe is at the root, not at the
[58:54] branches. You cut the branches and now
[58:56] the branch come out. But if you go to
[58:57] the root, you take the life out. Amen.
[59:00] Which brother preach total deliverance.
[59:03] Not partial, total. So we need to be
[59:05] delivered completely once for all. Amen.
[59:09] Glory to God. Wonderful. Wonderful. And
[59:11] once again, happy birthday, sister
[59:13] Sharon.
[59:19] Sister Sister Sharon birthday is very
[59:21] complicated to celebrate. It's a church
[59:24] birthday. It's my birthday. It's a
[59:26] pastor. So, it's very complicated. So, I
[59:28] got to put it here and there. So, I got
[59:30] all area covered.
[59:35] Amen. Man, you can bypass
[59:40] [Laughter]

[59:48] tonight. It's a convention. So, we got
[59:50] brother Solomon line up to preach
[59:52] tonight. So, you know, brother Solomon,
[59:55] he help us with the building up there
[59:57] and may God richly bless him for his uh
[1:00:00] work. When they say inspection, it's not
[1:00:02] a little thing. If it doesn't pass, we
[1:00:04] stuck. So, when he pass, we can move on.
[1:00:07] So, his inspection passed without any
[1:00:09] problem. When I was talking to him, he
[1:00:10] said, "But Stephen, usually they will
[1:00:12] find at least something." Boom. And they
[1:00:14] say, "You need to redo this." But for
[1:00:15] some reason, he did it. Everything pass
[1:00:17] in one shot. So God richly bless him for
[1:00:20] all the sacrifice and what he did for
[1:00:22] us.
[1:00:25] Amen. He saved us a lot of money from
[1:00:29] the first coat to his coat. It's a big
[1:00:31] difference. And we appreciate the
[1:00:33] brother for doing that. Amen. So let's
[1:00:35] sing only believe. He's at home. He
[1:00:37] preach like home and we pull like home.

[1:03:49] this quote to you. It's not actually a
[1:03:50] quote, but here in Souls that are in
[1:03:52] prison, uh I was just listening to a
[1:03:55] tape earlier and just begin to stir into
[1:03:57] my spirit some. I'd like to read it to
[1:03:59] you if that'd be okay. Uh but there is a
[1:04:02] tongue and interpretation that's given
[1:04:04] there at the end of that sermon when
[1:04:05] Brother Brandham gets done preaching.
[1:04:07] And my just be to uh stir me up. I'd
[1:04:10] like to share it with you. I'm sure
[1:04:11] you're familiar with it. Uh but here in
[1:04:14] souls that are in prison, uh the prophet
[1:04:16] got done preaching a sermon there and
[1:04:18] this brother gives an interpretation and
[1:04:20] this is the interpretation. My children
[1:04:22] today I say unto thee, yay, even I, the
[1:04:25] almighty God has looked upon the earth
[1:04:27] today. I've seen the evil that this
[1:04:30] creation has been brought to. And yay, I
[1:04:33] see the sin that man this day is
[1:04:35] dwelling within. And yay, dust thou not
[1:04:38] know that I have done a great thing for
[1:04:40] thee? Yay, I have sent forth a man in
[1:04:42] this last day. Yay, he might be a
[1:04:46] mouthpiece unto this generation. But I
[1:04:49] say unto thee, this day, my people, many
[1:04:51] have scoffed at this name, and yay,
[1:04:53] they've turned their backs upon the
[1:04:55] things that he has spoke. I want you to
[1:04:56] notice this. But I say unto thee that
[1:04:59] those that shall hear these words, who's
[1:05:03] he talking about? those that shall hear
[1:05:05] these words, I shall cause great
[1:05:08] blessings
[1:05:09] to fall upon them. I am the Almighty
[1:05:12] God. And I got to thinking on that. I
[1:05:15] thought that's me right there. Amen.
[1:05:18] I'll cause great blessings. And brother
[1:05:20] Steven just began speaking before I came
[1:05:22] up. I thought he said exactly what I
[1:05:24] wanted to say. You cannot curse what God
[1:05:26] has blessed. God said, "Those that hear
[1:05:29] this message, I'm going to cause great
[1:05:32] blessings to fall upon thee." And I
[1:05:34] don't know about you, but I look at that
[1:05:36] and I say, "Lord, I receive my blessing.
[1:05:39] I receive my blessing. I receive what
[1:05:42] you have for me." Amen. I believe that
[1:05:44] that was speaking about you and I. So, I
[1:05:46] just wanted to share that with you. It
[1:05:48] was a great blessing to me. Uh, but I
[1:05:50] wonder if we could just pray together
[1:05:52] before we look to the word. We just want
[1:05:54] to invite the author of the word to come
[1:05:55] and speak to us. So, let's just bow our
[1:05:57] heads together. Lord, Lord, we thank you
[1:06:00] for your grace and mercy on our lives,
[1:06:02] Lord, to assemble together one more time
[1:06:04] on this side of eternity. Lord, you
[1:06:06] know, we're living in a world that's
[1:06:08] falling apart right now as we even
[1:06:10] speak, Lord. But we're so glad that
[1:06:12] you've got a bride upon this face of the
[1:06:13] earth. And as the world is falling apart
[1:06:15] around us, you've got a people that are
[1:06:17] not falling apart, Lord, but they're
[1:06:19] falling into the place that you've
[1:06:21] called them to be. And Lord, we thank
[1:06:23] you for the word that you've sent in our
[1:06:24] age. Lord, none of these things are
[1:06:26] catching us by surprise or offguard, but
[1:06:29] Lord, you sent us a a great and
[1:06:32] wonderful message, Lord. And we know
[1:06:34] what our future holds. And Lord, for the
[1:06:36] world, their future's dark, but for the
[1:06:38] bride, it is very bright. And we thank
[1:06:40] you, Lord, for your word and for your
[1:06:43] promise that you've given us in the end
[1:06:44] time that we're living in. Lord, we pray
[1:06:47] that you would just speak to our hearts
[1:06:48] and lives here tonight. Lord, we did not
[1:06:51] come to see one another, as great as
[1:06:52] that may be. But Lord, we've come to see
[1:06:54] and to hear from you tonight. Lord, we
[1:06:56] know this service would be in vain if
[1:06:58] you wasn't here. Lord, it would be in
[1:07:00] vain if it was a man doing the
[1:07:01] preaching. Lord, it would be in vain,
[1:07:03] Lord, if all of this was just the works
[1:07:05] of a man. But I pray, Lord, that you
[1:07:08] would just anoint the gift you put in me
[1:07:09] tonight. Lord, I pray that your word
[1:07:12] would be sent forth and the power and
[1:07:13] the demonstration of the Holy Spirit.
[1:07:16] Lord, may your word be as a seed and may
[1:07:18] our hearts be as a soil. And Lord, may
[1:07:20] you plant your word deep within us,
[1:07:22] Lord. And I pray it would become Christ
[1:07:24] in us, which is the hope of glory. Lord,
[1:07:26] we just give you this meeting tonight.
[1:07:28] And we we invite you to this platform to
[1:07:30] come, Father. Lord, we pray that you
[1:07:33] would get all the glory and get all the
[1:07:34] honor and get all the praise. Lord,
[1:07:36] we'll be sure to give it to you and you
[1:07:38] alone. We pray in the most mighty name
[1:07:40] of Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. Amen.
[1:07:44] If you have your Bibles, I want to turn
[1:07:46] straight into the scripture. We don't
[1:07:47] want to hold you very long being a
[1:07:48] midweek service. Uh but we want to read
[1:07:51] here in 2 Corinthians the 10th chapter.
[1:07:54] We'll begin reading at the third verse
[1:07:56] and also in the book of Ephesians in the
[1:07:58] sixth chapter. As you're turning there,
[1:08:00] I just want to greet you tonight in the
[1:08:01] name of the Lord. And it's certainly a
[1:08:03] great honor to be here. And I appreciate
[1:08:05] brother Steven uh giving me the
[1:08:07] invitation to come and speak to you here
[1:08:09] tonight. account of the great
[1:08:10] responsibility and I appreciate the
[1:08:12] confidence he's put in us to be here.
[1:08:15] Amen. We just want to put our shoulder
[1:08:16] to the wheel. Amen. We're all on one
[1:08:18] great journey and uh we want to help how
[1:08:20] we can in the kingdom of God and uh we
[1:08:23] certainly appreciate this church here
[1:08:24] and your friendship and uh we're we're
[1:08:27] all just message believers. Amen. I
[1:08:30] believe it. You believe it. We believe
[1:08:31] it. And we just want God to have his way
[1:08:33] tonight. Amen. One thing I've come to
[1:08:35] find out is that God is a sovereign God.
[1:08:38] And you can't make God do nothing. But
[1:08:40] he said you can't ask that your joy
[1:08:42] might be made full. So I'm just asking
[1:08:44] for God to speak. And I'm asking for God
[1:08:47] to have his will. And whatever he wants
[1:08:49] to do tonight, I just want to be
[1:08:51] standing near when he does it. That's
[1:08:52] right. Amen. That's my heart's desire. I
[1:08:54] know it's yours. Let's read together if
[1:08:56] you will in 2 Corinthians 10 and the
[1:08:58] third chap or or the 10th chapter and
[1:09:00] the third verse. Familiar reading of
[1:09:02] scripture here. The Bible would say
[1:09:04] this. For though we walk in the flesh,
[1:09:07] we do not war after the flesh. For the
[1:09:10] weapons of our warfare are not carnal,
[1:09:13] but they're mighty through God to the
[1:09:16] pulling down of strongholds. I want you
[1:09:18] to notice the Bible says that our
[1:09:20] weapons are mighty. And by these
[1:09:22] weapons, it'll be to the pulling down of
[1:09:25] strongholds. So, in other words, what
[1:09:27] God has given us is enabling us to pull
[1:09:30] down strongholds. You believe that
[1:09:32] tonight? You said, "What he give us?" He
[1:09:34] gave us his word and casting down
[1:09:37] imaginations. I I think it's a beautiful
[1:09:39] scripture there. Casting down
[1:09:41] imaginations. You know, we talk about
[1:09:43] predestination and we believe it with
[1:09:45] all of our hearts. We believe it how the
[1:09:47] prophet said it. But you've got to
[1:09:48] understand that there's a part that you
[1:09:50] have to do in the scripture. See, the
[1:09:53] Bible don't say God's casting down
[1:09:55] imaginations, but this scripture is
[1:09:57] saying you're casting down imaginations.
[1:09:59] casting down imaginations and every high
[1:10:03] thing that exaltth itself against the
[1:10:05] knowledge of God. So the Bible's telling
[1:10:08] you very clearly there's going to be
[1:10:10] things that come your way that are going
[1:10:12] to try to exalt themselves against the
[1:10:15] knowledge of God. The Bible says
[1:10:18] bringing into captivity
[1:10:20] every thought to the obedience of
[1:10:23] Christ. Amen. Amen. Bringing every
[1:10:25] thought into captivity to the obedience
[1:10:27] of Christ. Let's turn also in Ephesians
[1:10:30] the 6th chapter
[1:10:32] and the 12th verse. How many wants to
[1:10:34] break every stronghold of the devil
[1:10:36] tonight?
[1:10:38] Amen. That should all be our heart's
[1:10:40] desire. Ephesians 6 and 12, the Bible
[1:10:43] reads this. For we wrestle not against
[1:10:45] flesh and blood, but against
[1:10:47] principalities,
[1:10:49] against powers, against the rulers of
[1:10:52] the darkness of this world, against
[1:10:54] spiritual wickedness in high places.
[1:10:57] That's right. Amen. We ask that God will
[1:10:59] bless his word. You can be seated
[1:11:01] tonight. I'd like to take a title from
[1:11:03] this and speak to you on pulling down of
[1:11:05] strongholds. Amen. Strongholds no more.
[1:11:08] In other words, amen. But so we see here
[1:11:10] in the scripture that our battles that
[1:11:12] we are facing that uh they're not
[1:11:14] fleshly battles. And see, I believe that
[1:11:17] God sent us a message in this end time
[1:11:19] to expose all of the works of the enemy.
[1:11:21] And I I believe that if you're ignorant
[1:11:24] how Satan's working, it's because you
[1:11:26] decided to be ignorant. It's not because
[1:11:28] you have to be ignorant of Satan's
[1:11:30] devices, but it's because you decided to
[1:11:32] be ignorant of Satan's devices. I don't
[1:11:34] believe uh that the bride of Christ
[1:11:36] should be ignorant of how Satan is
[1:11:39] working. But we should all know exactly
[1:11:41] how the devil's working. Amen. See, the
[1:11:44] prophet taught you and I, he said, see,
[1:11:45] the thing of it is is that we want to
[1:11:48] try to keep all the punches off of us as
[1:11:50] much as we can. So, we know we're in a
[1:11:53] great battle, and we know that the devil
[1:11:55] on every hand is trying to trap and
[1:11:58] trying to snare the believer. And that's
[1:12:00] why we've always got to be fortified
[1:12:03] behind the word of God. And and I
[1:12:05] believe that God sent us a prophet like
[1:12:07] unto Elijah in the Old Testament. We
[1:12:09] read there in the Old Testament when he
[1:12:12] would go and begin to tell the secrets
[1:12:14] of the Syrian army and and the Syrian
[1:12:16] army said, "We've got a traitor in our
[1:12:18] midst because every time we go to do
[1:12:21] something, somehow the children of
[1:12:23] Israel, they're figuring out our battle
[1:12:25] plan and they're figuring out where
[1:12:27] we're going to hit, what we're going to
[1:12:29] do. Is that the truth?" And they said,
[1:12:31] "There's a there's a traitor amongst
[1:12:32] us." us. But then a man rose up and
[1:12:34] said, "No, there's not a traitor amongst
[1:12:36] us, but they've got a prophet on their
[1:12:38] side. And every time we go to do
[1:12:41] something, they've got a sear that's
[1:12:42] over there. And he's revealing the
[1:12:45] secrets in the bed chambers." And so
[1:12:48] every time we try to do something, the
[1:12:50] children of Israel know and they're
[1:12:52] waiting because they know what we're
[1:12:54] going to do. Now, I believe it's the
[1:12:56] same way with the bride of Christ.
[1:12:58] Listen. Amen. It don't shock me on
[1:13:00] Monday morning when I wake up and I got
[1:13:02] the devil knocking on my door. It don't
[1:13:04] shock me on Tuesday when I'm in the heat
[1:13:06] of a battle. I'm looking for it. Amen.
[1:13:09] You That's just the truth. Amen. I I'm
[1:13:12] looking for the next battle. If I'm not
[1:13:14] in one, I'm getting ready to go in one.
[1:13:16] If I'm not see it a It ain't surprising
[1:13:19] to the believer because we ain't here
[1:13:21] for a picnic. We're not here to take it
[1:13:23] easy. Amen. The prophet said, "Our rest
[1:13:26] ain't here. Our rest is on the other
[1:13:28] side.
[1:13:31] Amen. While we're here, we've got to
[1:13:32] fight every single day. Let me just tell
[1:13:35] you, if you don't plan on fighting,
[1:13:36] you're probably in the wrong game. If
[1:13:38] you don't plan on waring, Amen. You're
[1:13:40] probably in the wrong place. But listen,
[1:13:42] God has called us all to be fighters and
[1:13:44] warriors. Amen. I know people like a
[1:13:47] easy belieism Christianity and they
[1:13:50] don't like talking about this, but
[1:13:51] listen. Amen. We're here in a great war
[1:13:54] today. Amen. And we're here to overcome.
[1:13:56] And it's not going to be just by by God
[1:13:59] pushing us through a tube and we get on
[1:14:02] the other side and say, "Bless God,
[1:14:03] overcome." But it'll be because we
[1:14:06] fought to win the prize.
[1:14:09] It's exactly right. But I I don't want
[1:14:11] to get ahead of myself in preaching on
[1:14:12] this, but but I want to show you some
[1:14:14] things here in the scripture. We
[1:14:15] understand that the devil is constantly
[1:14:18] trying to get you and I trapped in a
[1:14:20] stronghold.
[1:14:22] Isn't that right? Now, now a stronghold,
[1:14:24] it may not be something that that
[1:14:26] happens overnight, but it's something
[1:14:28] that starts somewhere. The prophet
[1:14:30] preached an entire sermon called from
[1:14:32] that time on. May preached it more than
[1:14:34] once, but he went to show you that that
[1:14:36] that the condition you get in, it
[1:14:39] started somewhere. It started from a
[1:14:42] decision you made. It started it started
[1:14:44] where you said, "Well, you know, I I
[1:14:46] know there's a scripture against that,
[1:14:48] but I don't really think it means that."
[1:14:50] or or you or you lay the scripture aside
[1:14:52] and say, "Well, I know that's there, but
[1:14:54] I really want to go do this." Amen.
[1:14:57] Listen, it's because you made a decision
[1:15:00] that you wanted to do what you wanted to
[1:15:02] do instead of doing what the word of God
[1:15:06] said to do. And then when you find
[1:15:08] yourself in a mess and you start blaming
[1:15:10] God when God had nothing to do with your
[1:15:13] condition, but you had everything to do
[1:15:16] with your condition. Amen. See, what
[1:15:18] does the Bible say? Amen. That you get
[1:15:20] into that condition when you're drawn
[1:15:22] away by your own lust.
[1:15:26] That's what got you in the stronghold to
[1:15:28] begin with. But see, before you go down
[1:15:30] the wrong path, it starts out as a
[1:15:32] thought. Before you make a wrong
[1:15:34] decision, it starts out as a thought.
[1:15:37] Amen. You first think about it and you
[1:15:39] begin to reason in your mind. Before you
[1:15:42] ever get in a backsliden condition,
[1:15:45] you've already got backsliden in your
[1:15:47] mind. Before you've left church, I've
[1:15:50] seen it many of times, but Amen. before
[1:15:52] somebody's left church, they they've
[1:15:54] already left in their mind. They're
[1:15:56] sitting in the house of God and they're
[1:15:58] already gone. And people say, "Brother,
[1:16:00] I tell you, I just didn't see it coming.
[1:16:02] I didn't see that he would were leaving
[1:16:04] back." I say, "What are you talking
[1:16:05] about? He left two months ago. He'd
[1:16:09] already left in his wife." See, and
[1:16:11] that's where the devil works. He's
[1:16:12] working in the mind. And then it's a
[1:16:16] matter of time before what is in here
[1:16:19] begins to manifest through your life.
[1:16:22] Now, let me tell you, Amen. The prophet
[1:16:24] taught you and I, Amen, that the at the
[1:16:27] womb of the spirit's the mind, right?
[1:16:29] The womb of your spirits in your mind.
[1:16:31] That's why you be careful what you
[1:16:33] listen to. You be careful the things you
[1:16:36] listen to, the music you listen to.
[1:16:39] Well, I don't think there's a harmon
[1:16:40] there. That's what the devil wants you
[1:16:42] to say. Amen. Can I just say this? Why
[1:16:44] don't you just stick with the
[1:16:45] oldfashioned Holy Ghost music?
[1:16:50] I'm going to get in trouble, but I I
[1:16:52] might as well just preach here for a
[1:16:53] moment. Amen. Listen, you've got to
[1:16:56] guard yourself. See, that's what the
[1:16:58] devil wants you to do. Well, you know
[1:17:00] that ain't going to hurt much. And you
[1:17:02] know that ain't that big of a deal. But
[1:17:04] see what it is. These things are written
[1:17:06] under inspiration.
[1:17:08] And before you know it, you're in a
[1:17:10] stronghold and you're gloomy and doomy.
[1:17:13] Let me just share this with you. I may
[1:17:14] have told it to you before. There's a
[1:17:16] sister battling with depression. She got
[1:17:19] prayed for. The devil got cast out. She
[1:17:21] came back battling with depression. The
[1:17:23] Bible talks about when the spirit goes
[1:17:25] from you, you walk in dry places. It's
[1:17:27] scriptural. And the prophet showed you
[1:17:29] and I that he said you got to get the
[1:17:31] good man of the house to keep it clean.
[1:17:34] And you've got to do your part to stay
[1:17:35] away from those things. don't get
[1:17:37] entangled again. And this sister kept on
[1:17:39] going in a horrible cycle of in and out
[1:17:42] and in and out of this depression spell.
[1:17:44] And they finally sat down with her and
[1:17:46] began to talk to her said, "Sis, you
[1:17:48] know what? Are you doing at home? Are
[1:17:49] you are you doing anything wrong?" She
[1:17:51] said, "Well, I I'm not living in sin.
[1:17:53] I'm not doing this." And they said,
[1:17:54] "What kind of music you listening to?"
[1:17:56] And come to find out, she was listening
[1:17:58] to this soft, mellow piano music, but it
[1:18:02] was a gloomy and it was a sad and it was
[1:18:04] a Amen. Depress. Yeah. You know what I'm
[1:18:06] talking about. You a a sad song made you
[1:18:09] want to cry and it was inviting a spirit
[1:18:12] from hell.
[1:18:14] It was inviting a spirit and she found
[1:18:17] herself in a stronghold and she had to
[1:18:20] keep running back to the ministry to
[1:18:22] pray for her. But the whole time she was
[1:18:25] getting entangled with something that
[1:18:28] she had the power to cast it down the
[1:18:31] whole time. And they said, "Sis, turn
[1:18:33] that junk off and stop listening to it."
[1:18:36] And she turned it off and she was
[1:18:38] completely and totally delivered once
[1:18:42] you find out the root cause. Amen. You
[1:18:45] can kill the root and you can be on your
[1:18:48] way to deliverance.
[1:18:50] Well, it's just the truth. You say,
[1:18:52] "Well, I don't think it's that
[1:18:53] important." That's exactly what the
[1:18:55] devil wants you to think. I don't think
[1:18:57] music like that's bad. That's what the
[1:18:59] devil wants you to think.
[1:19:01] But before you know it, you're entangled
[1:19:04] in depression. You're entangled in
[1:19:06] suicide. You're entangled in all of
[1:19:09] these things. And you wonder how you got
[1:19:11] there. You wonder how you got there.
[1:19:14] Amen. It was a trap of the devil the
[1:19:16] whole time, but you didn't realize it.
[1:19:19] And this stuff was getting into the womb
[1:19:21] of your spirit, which is your mind.
[1:19:24] Amen. If I plant a tomato seed and I put
[1:19:27] sun and water and I know it's a good
[1:19:29] seed, why am I going to be shocked when
[1:19:32] I see that thing growing? Hey, I planted
[1:19:34] it and I'm watering it. I'm not
[1:19:37] surprised that it's growing. So why in
[1:19:39] the world do you get shocked when you've
[1:19:41] been planting the wrong seed and you've
[1:19:43] been planting the wrong thing and you've
[1:19:45] been watering it and it begins to grow?
[1:19:48] You say, "How'd the devil get there?
[1:19:50] You've been feeding and watering that
[1:19:52] old dog." I tell you what you need to
[1:19:54] do. You need to kick the food out and
[1:19:56] kick the water out and say, "Devil, you
[1:19:58] ain't living here no more. Devil, you
[1:20:00] ain't working on me no more. Devil,
[1:20:03] you're not staying in my mind no more.
[1:20:05] You're not staying in my home no more."
[1:20:07] Amen. Stop feeding that old dog and kill
[1:20:10] that old dog. Amen. And walk in your
[1:20:13] freedom as a son and daughter of God.
[1:20:18] It's just the truth, church. You might
[1:20:20] as well say amen. You keep on putting
[1:20:22] food on the porch. All the stray dogs in
[1:20:25] town are coming to your house and you
[1:20:27] want
[1:20:30] Hallelujah to God. Y'all know it's the
[1:20:33] truth.
[1:20:36] Praise the Lord. It's just the truth.
[1:20:39] You're inviting him those things. And
[1:20:41] listen, you can put that in the
[1:20:42] negative, but what about in the
[1:20:44] positive? What about when you're
[1:20:46] planting seeds of God and you're
[1:20:48] planting the word of God? You're
[1:20:50] planting the message of the hour. Amen.
[1:20:53] You're sewing good seed. You say,
[1:20:54] "Preacher, I tell you, I I've been
[1:20:56] sewing the seed. I've been doing the
[1:20:58] right thing, but I ain't seeing the
[1:21:00] plant grow." It ain't up to you to see
[1:21:02] the plant grow. Amen. You just got to
[1:21:04] leave it alone. Hey, if you can plant
[1:21:07] the wrong thing and it'll grow and and
[1:21:10] create a stronghold around you, what
[1:21:12] about when you plant a good and
[1:21:14] righteous seed?
[1:21:17] I tell you what you got to do. You got
[1:21:19] to stop digging that thing up and you
[1:21:21] got to plant the promise and you got to
[1:21:23] water it with praise.
[1:21:26] You got to water it with praise. Let me
[1:21:29] just give you a little secret in here.
[1:21:31] When you planted a promise of God and
[1:21:34] you ain't seeing it happen and you ain't
[1:21:36] seeing it the next day, once the devil's
[1:21:38] come to, he comes to your mind and he
[1:21:40] knocks. See, I told you God don't answer
[1:21:43] prayer. I told you God don't heal the
[1:21:45] sick. I told you God don't bring fruit
[1:21:47] to a barren womb. I told you God don't
[1:21:49] do this. And see what you do. You're
[1:21:51] letting the seed of doubt grow in your
[1:21:53] mind. But stop it right then and grab a
[1:21:57] hold of that thought that is trying to
[1:21:59] exalt itself against the knowledge of
[1:22:02] God. And the Bible commands you to cast
[1:22:05] that thing down. Hey, I tell you what I
[1:22:08] say. I think it's time that we stop
[1:22:10] letting these thoughts have their way in
[1:22:12] our mind, but let's grab a hold of them
[1:22:15] and cast them down.
[1:22:18] Are you with me tonight? Now, I'm not
[1:22:20] talking about a good sermon. I'm talking
[1:22:22] about lift your hand and grab a hold of
[1:22:25] that saw. See, see, I I I love literal
[1:22:27] preaching. I love a preacher that don't
[1:22:30] just tell me what to talk about it, but
[1:22:33] tell me what to do.
[1:22:35] [Applause]
[1:22:38] Tell me what to do. You You talk about
[1:22:41] deliverance, but tell me what to do.
[1:22:43] Amen. Next time you feel that spirit
[1:22:45] coming to you, just raise your hand and
[1:22:48] say, "Devil, in the name of Jesus
[1:22:50] Christ, I'm grabbing a hold of you and
[1:22:53] I'm pulling you down." Hey, I got to
[1:22:56] tell the devil tonight. Amen. Satan,
[1:22:59] your kingdom's coming down. And Jesus,
[1:23:02] your kingdom is rising up.
[1:23:06] Amen. Pull down the strongholds. Amen.
[1:23:08] Pull down the thoughts that are trying
[1:23:11] to exalt themselves against the
[1:23:13] knowledge and the word of God.
[1:23:17] That's the truth.
[1:23:20] Amen. You're letting those things exalt
[1:23:22] theirelves.
[1:23:23] You've got to cast them down. Amen. Your
[1:23:26] weapons are mighty through God to the
[1:23:29] pulling down of strongholds.
[1:23:32] Pull down the stronghold. Amen. Can I
[1:23:34] tell you this? Amen. God told the
[1:23:36] children of Israel in the Old Testament,
[1:23:38] the book of Numbers, Numbers 33, that
[1:23:41] when you go into the land, there's going
[1:23:42] to be Amalachites in the land. There's
[1:23:45] going to be children. Amen. Maybe a
[1:23:47] different scripture that I quoted there,
[1:23:48] but there's a scripture in Numbers 33
[1:23:50] talks about to pluck down and tear down
[1:23:52] the graven images. But there's a word
[1:23:55] concerning the Amalachites that's in the
[1:23:57] land. And God tells them to kill all the
[1:23:59] children, kill all the adults. And you
[1:24:02] think, "Well, brother, that that sounds
[1:24:04] very cruel. Why would you kill a child
[1:24:06] Amalachite? Because the Amalachites were
[1:24:08] a they were they were an enemy against
[1:24:11] the children of Israel. And any chance
[1:24:13] they got, they were attacking Israel.
[1:24:16] They were waring against Israel. And God
[1:24:19] said, "While they're a baby, go ahead
[1:24:20] and kill them." And let me tell you
[1:24:23] this, amen. A baby Amalachite is a whole
[1:24:26] lot easier to deal with. Amen. Than a
[1:24:30] than a 25year-old Amalachi that is in
[1:24:33] the prime of his youth. And that's why
[1:24:35] the devil says, "Well, you know, ju just
[1:24:37] leave it alone. It ain't a big deal. You
[1:24:39] just just deal with it tomorrow." Amen.
[1:24:42] Kill that thing before it has a starting
[1:24:45] chance.
[1:24:46] [Applause]
[1:24:48] [Music]
[1:24:49] [Applause]
[1:24:51] Preach, my brother. Glory to God. Amen.
[1:24:55] I hope that's okay. But see, that's what
[1:24:58] the devil's doing. Amen. He's trying to
[1:25:01] trap us and get us into a stronghold.
[1:25:05] And see, before you do before you do the
[1:25:07] wrong thing, first you're laying aside
[1:25:09] the word of God.
[1:25:11] And you're going on your own road. And
[1:25:13] God will let you do it. God will let you
[1:25:16] do the wrong thing. He'll let you go
[1:25:18] down the wrong road. God don't make you
[1:25:20] do anything, but he will give you his
[1:25:22] word.
[1:25:24] He'll give you his word, and it's up to
[1:25:26] you what you do with that word. And see,
[1:25:28] that's why the devil is constantly
[1:25:30] attacking the word because if you don't
[1:25:33] got confidence in the word, then you'll
[1:25:36] just do whatever you want to do. The
[1:25:38] prophet said here in Satan's Eden, he
[1:25:40] says, "Certainly, Satan has had a
[1:25:41] marvelous success in carrying out his
[1:25:44] threats by the people letting him
[1:25:46] explain away in every age the value of
[1:25:51] God's promised word to that age." He
[1:25:54] said, "See, that's exactly how he's done
[1:25:56] it. He's explained away the value of the
[1:25:59] word." He says, "Well, well, that that
[1:26:02] ain't that important. I don't think it's
[1:26:04] that important." And that's what the
[1:26:06] devil wants to do to you. Amen. See,
[1:26:09] that's the devil preaching his own false
[1:26:11] doctrine to you. And he wants you to eat
[1:26:14] on that. Do you realize that? Amen. Look
[1:26:16] at the church world today. It ain't
[1:26:18] nothing more than a bunch of
[1:26:20] motivational speeches.
[1:26:21] [Applause]
[1:26:23] They ain't using the word of God. It's
[1:26:25] health, wealth, and prosperity. Your
[1:26:27] best life now. That's the that that's
[1:26:30] the fake gospel that this world is
[1:26:32] preaching. And it makes you feel good
[1:26:35] and it makes you it makes you pay tithes
[1:26:38] good and makes you do all of these
[1:26:40] things good. Amen. But see what it is.
[1:26:42] It's the devil's gospel. The devil wants
[1:26:46] you to feel good about yourself. He
[1:26:49] wants you to feel comfortable. He wants
[1:26:51] you to feel all of these ways. Amen. But
[1:26:53] listen, that is not the gospel of this
[1:26:55] Bible.
[1:26:59] That's the truth. That's not the gospel
[1:27:01] of this Bible. That's a different
[1:27:03] gospel.
[1:27:04] And see, that's what the devil's trying
[1:27:06] to do is preach a different gospel to
[1:27:08] you and I.
[1:27:10] Amen. See, that's what the prophet said.
[1:27:12] He said, "See, it's a spiritual womb and
[1:27:13] a physical womb. And the mind is the
[1:27:15] womb of the spirit." See, that's why you
[1:27:18] don't listen to your mind. You listen to
[1:27:21] the word. Don't listen to what you
[1:27:24] think. That's what he did. Listen to the
[1:27:27] word. When you listen to what you think
[1:27:29] or your own ideology or what you think
[1:27:32] sounds good, you're going to get led a
[1:27:34] million miles away. You got to lay aside
[1:27:36] your own thinking and cleave only to the
[1:27:40] word of God. Listen, it don't matter if
[1:27:42] you understand it all. You just got to
[1:27:45] believe it all. It don't matter if you
[1:27:47] can make everything make sense. God is
[1:27:50] not calling understanders. God is
[1:27:52] calling believers of his word. And I
[1:27:56] don't believe cuz I understand. I
[1:27:59] believe cuz I am a believer. And it's in
[1:28:02] me to believe. If I only believe cuz I
[1:28:05] understood, I'd only be a Pharisee. But
[1:28:08] I believe because I am a believer.
[1:28:13] And see, the devil wants you to listen
[1:28:14] to your mind. But see, that's where you
[1:28:16] got to understand that's where the devil
[1:28:18] works. See, don't listen to your mind.
[1:28:21] Listen to the word. Now, now I believe
[1:28:24] this is a battle that started in heaven.
[1:28:26] I believe when Lucifer, he desired to be
[1:28:28] worshiped as God and he didn't think it
[1:28:30] was fair that God was getting all the
[1:28:32] glory and God was getting all the
[1:28:34] praise. And so what he do? He went about
[1:28:36] preaching. The book of Revelation tells
[1:28:39] you that the tail of the dragon, it drew
[1:28:42] a third of the angels.
[1:28:45] It was not the It was not the T A I L.
[1:28:48] It was the T A L E. See, let me tell you
[1:28:52] this. The devil is the most wonderful,
[1:28:54] polished preacher that you'll ever hear.
[1:28:57] Amen. Well, listen. We're talking about
[1:28:59] a being that don't know any sin. But
[1:29:02] Lucifer was such a good preacher that he
[1:29:05] got into the mind of an angelic being
[1:29:08] and so deceived them that he drew a
[1:29:12] third of them out of heaven with him.
[1:29:15] Don't you tell me the devil ain't a good
[1:29:17] preacher. And don't you tell me the
[1:29:19] devil ain't behind the media pull pits
[1:29:21] today.
[1:29:22] Amen. Let me just preach here for a
[1:29:24] moment.
[1:29:26] It's going to open up a whole big
[1:29:28] channel if I don't stop. Amen. But see,
[1:29:30] that's the that that's the ministry of
[1:29:32] Lucifer.
[1:29:34] Amen. I don't know how many angels it
[1:29:35] was, but the Bible says a third. Amen.
[1:29:38] It could have been thousands. Could have
[1:29:39] been. We don't know how many it was. But
[1:29:41] let me tell you this. The devil is not
[1:29:43] okay having a small platform. He don't
[1:29:47] want a small platform in the world. He
[1:29:49] don't want to just get one or two. Amen.
[1:29:51] He wants to deceive nations and as many
[1:29:55] as he can. Amen. See, see what the devil
[1:29:57] want. He wants to be worshiped as God.
[1:30:00] And let me tell you what he was back
[1:30:02] then is what he is today. And that has
[1:30:06] not changed one bit
[1:30:08] as to truth. Amen. Now, the prophet will
[1:30:10] run this through the Bible and show you
[1:30:13] how a heavenly battle became an earthly
[1:30:15] battle. And he'll show you the
[1:30:17] descendants of Cain. And then he'll show
[1:30:19] you all through Noah and Ham, Sham, and
[1:30:21] Japheth. And then he'll show you with
[1:30:23] the Nimrod. Amen. That created the city
[1:30:25] of Babylon. And then you got the Tower
[1:30:28] of Babel. Amen. And then the prophet ran
[1:30:30] that same spirit and showed you where
[1:30:33] idolatry began. Amen. Was in Babylon.
[1:30:37] The city of Babylon. Direct quote. The
[1:30:39] prophet said that's where idolatry began
[1:30:42] was in Babylon. Amen. What is it? The
[1:30:45] devil getting worship unto a false
[1:30:48] image. Amen. See, Amen. I think it's
[1:30:50] beautiful. The prophet breaks into that
[1:30:52] Babylon. He said, and I meant the gates
[1:30:54] of heaven, but God turned it into the
[1:30:57] gates of confusion.
[1:31:00] Babylon. The devil thought, I tell you
[1:31:02] what, I'm going to make a tower into
[1:31:04] heaven and everybody's going to see how
[1:31:06] great it is and how wonderful it is.
[1:31:09] See, the prophet said them Canaanites,
[1:31:11] they were they were good at at
[1:31:12] instruments and they was good at
[1:31:14] buildings and they were scientific and
[1:31:16] smart. And you've got the Abels just out
[1:31:19] there in the garden. And the Canaanites,
[1:31:21] they're so beautiful and wonderful and
[1:31:23] great and big. And the prophet ran that
[1:31:25] city of Babylon into the book of
[1:31:28] Revelation and showed you it's now not a
[1:31:30] city, but it's now a woman, that great
[1:31:34] And it was written on her mystery
[1:31:37] Babylon. And the Bible says that she sat
[1:31:40] on the face of many waters. And the
[1:31:43] prophet said, "What is it?" It's many
[1:31:45] people. And the Bible records, Abram,
[1:31:48] that there is kings and nations that are
[1:31:51] drunk on the wine of her fornication.
[1:31:55] The prophet said, "What was it?" It was
[1:31:57] the doctrine that she preached and they
[1:32:00] was drunk from the wine of her
[1:32:02] fornication. And the prophet showed you
[1:32:05] it was the Antichrist all the way
[1:32:07] through. And it was the devil that was
[1:32:10] deceiving millions upon millions of
[1:32:13] people by the gospel that he preached.
[1:32:17] [Applause]
[1:32:18] Is that the truth? Hey, I don't have
[1:32:21] time to get into it. It's just far too
[1:32:22] deep to get into. But the prophet showed
[1:32:24] you and I on this. He said, "What was
[1:32:26] that?" Amen. Who was it that started the
[1:32:29] Hail Marys? It was the Antichrist
[1:32:30] spirit. He said Paul didn't start an
[1:32:33] organization. Peter didn't start an
[1:32:35] organization. Amen. It was the Catholics
[1:32:38] that started that organization.
[1:32:41] Amen. And the Bible says it was a mother
[1:32:43] that had daughter harlots. He said
[1:32:46] a harlot is not a boy. It is a girl. And
[1:32:50] that's written upon her blasphemous
[1:32:52] names. See what you're seeing. Amen.
[1:32:54] You're seeing the greatest stronghold
[1:32:57] that the devil listen friends. We're
[1:33:00] talking about the religion of the world
[1:33:02] is Catholicism. And her daughters have
[1:33:05] got amen. Her daughters have got
[1:33:06] churches set up all over this world and
[1:33:10] she's got blasphemous names written on
[1:33:12] her as Methodist and Baptist and
[1:33:14] Presbyterian and Lucia and he's
[1:33:17] preaching to the masses of people and
[1:33:19] the people are in bondage and they're
[1:33:22] tied down and they're lost as lost can
[1:33:24] be and they are drunk on the wine of her
[1:33:28] fornication. But I heard another voice.
[1:33:35] I said I heard another voice. Amen. That
[1:33:38] be to cry out, "Come out of her, my
[1:33:41] people." The prophet said, "The message
[1:33:43] of the hour said, come out of her, my
[1:33:47] people, and be not partaker of our pl."
[1:33:50] I want to tell the devil, there may be a
[1:33:52] lot of kings drunk on your wine. There
[1:33:54] may be a lot of churches drunk on your
[1:33:56] wine, but I am drunk on a different wine
[1:33:58] tonight. It's a wine that the devil
[1:34:01] don't got. I'm intoxicated by the Holy
[1:34:04] Spirit that came down on the upper room.
[1:34:08] Amen. Listen, devil. You may have a cup,
[1:34:11] but that ain't my cup. You may have a
[1:34:13] drink, but that ain't my drink.
[1:34:19] Ain't that the truth? That's why the
[1:34:21] prophet preached sermons about why I'm
[1:34:24] against organized religion. He said,
[1:34:26] "I've come amongst you people and you
[1:34:28] say the days of miracles are passed and
[1:34:30] there ain't no divine healing and Jesus
[1:34:33] Christ ain't the same yesterday, today
[1:34:34] and forever." And you wonder why is the
[1:34:37] prophet preaching things like that. It's
[1:34:39] because those daughter harlots was
[1:34:42] saying that Jesus is not the same. He
[1:34:45] don't do that no more. That was only for
[1:34:47] the apostles. But I thank God, Amen,
[1:34:50] from Malachi 4 and5. Amen. that restored
[1:34:54] us back to the original. Amen. Word of
[1:34:57] the Bible, not the word of the church,
[1:35:00] not the word of the pope, but the word
[1:35:02] that came out of this Bible.
[1:35:06] It's just a truth. Amen. You can study
[1:35:08] it all out. Amen. The prophet said the
[1:35:11] book of Genesis is a seed chapter. You
[1:35:14] can trace everything. You can trace all
[1:35:16] these evil spirits. You Amen. You can
[1:35:18] trace Babylon through through the Old
[1:35:21] Testament. all of these things. I tell
[1:35:23] you what, amen. We're not ignorant of
[1:35:25] Satan's devices.
[1:35:28] Amen. We're drinking tonight, but we're
[1:35:30] drinking from a different cup.
[1:35:32] Hallelujah to God. Amen. I'm drunk on a
[1:35:35] different kind of wine. Amen. It's the
[1:35:37] same wine that they got in Acts the
[1:35:39] second chapter. Amen. You ought to tell
[1:35:41] the devil tonight. Devil, I'm not
[1:35:43] drinking from your cup. You know, I got
[1:35:45] to pondering on that. I thought, my why
[1:35:47] do the Bible say they are drunk on the
[1:35:49] wine of her fornications? The prophet
[1:35:51] showed you it was her doctrine. You
[1:35:53] think about this new age church
[1:35:54] movement. It's a bunch of feelgood. It's
[1:35:57] a bunch of emotion. They they try to get
[1:36:00] you to feel good about who you are.
[1:36:02] They're not condemning you. They're not
[1:36:04] preaching against sin. And the prophet
[1:36:06] said, "What's the devil do? He'll preach
[1:36:09] this and he'll preach that, but he ain't
[1:36:11] going to tell you to live right. He
[1:36:13] ain't going to preach your clothesline
[1:36:14] religion. He ain't going to preach going
[1:36:16] to Pentecost religion. He's going to
[1:36:19] preach a superficial,
[1:36:21] shallow, feel-good gospel. Listen, if
[1:36:24] the gospel don't spank you a little bit,
[1:36:27] it probably ain't the right gospel. If
[1:36:29] the gospel don't step on your toes a
[1:36:31] little bit, it probably ain't the right
[1:36:33] gospel.
[1:36:35] It's the truth. I mean, the devil just
[1:36:38] wants to patch you and you feel, oh, you
[1:36:40] know, I'm just a me I'm just a starch
[1:36:42] methodist. I'm just a start. and he'll
[1:36:44] creep into the message churches. I'm
[1:36:47] just a message believer. I believe God
[1:36:50] sent a prophet. I'm okay. And the
[1:36:52] prophet said, "That's what the devil
[1:36:54] wants you to do." He said, "Being a
[1:36:56] Baptist don't mean you're okay." He
[1:36:58] said, "Being a Pentecostal don't mean
[1:37:00] you're okay." Amen. You got to go all
[1:37:03] the way to the same experience that they
[1:37:05] received in Acts the 2 chapter
[1:37:09] and don't settle for anything less.
[1:37:13] Amen. See, all these things start
[1:37:15] somewhere. You and you can trace it all
[1:37:17] the way in the Old Testament and show
[1:37:19] you. Amen. The prophet talked about with
[1:37:21] Eve, he said before she ever conceived
[1:37:23] physically,
[1:37:25] she conceived spiritually in the womb of
[1:37:28] her mind,
[1:37:30] my brother. There it is. That's the
[1:37:31] truth. And the prophet showed you and I,
[1:37:34] he said, see, the battleground begins in
[1:37:36] the human mind. That's where the battle
[1:37:38] starts. So, so that's why the devil is
[1:37:41] waring in your mind as hard as he is.
[1:37:44] because it's the womb spoken word was
[1:37:46] the original seed. Brother was set this
[1:37:48] way. He said see what it is. It's both
[1:37:50] physical and spiritual. He said with Eve
[1:37:53] first that came to the that came to the
[1:37:56] spiritual womb then the physical. He
[1:37:58] said and anytime that a woman takes the
[1:38:00] wrong step, I'm talking about Christ and
[1:38:01] the bride. He said anytime a woman takes
[1:38:04] the wrong step, she first has to receive
[1:38:06] that into her mind.
[1:38:08] He said some slicker has to persuade her
[1:38:11] and she listens to it against her own
[1:38:14] better judgment. He said and then the
[1:38:17] wrong act is committed.
[1:38:20] He said see first Satan hit Eve's mind
[1:38:23] and in the womb of her mind she doubted
[1:38:26] God's word and then came the actual act.
[1:38:29] And the prophet said and the only way
[1:38:31] that we can ever be born again is first
[1:38:34] in the womb of the mind. He said,
[1:38:37] "Receive the word." And then the spirit
[1:38:40] comes in on top of that and brings that
[1:38:42] word to life. He said, "There you are.
[1:38:45] What does it?" He said, "It's real
[1:38:47] gospel teaching."
[1:38:50] He said, "I believe if St. Paul was
[1:38:52] standing here today, he would teach the
[1:38:54] same thing that I do in this hour." He
[1:38:58] said, "What is it?" It was a virgin
[1:38:59] mine. He talks about Mary there. He
[1:39:01] said, "It was a virgin mind. A virgin
[1:39:03] womb." He said a virgin womb for that
[1:39:06] baby to Amen. He said and what brought
[1:39:08] forth? It brought forth results.
[1:39:12] Amen. See, so it all starts in the mind.
[1:39:14] That's where the devil Amen. See, before
[1:39:16] you're ever defeated, it started in your
[1:39:19] mind. As I said already, before you're
[1:39:22] ever backsliding, it starts in your
[1:39:24] mind. Amen. Before before something
[1:39:26] happens, you first have believed it in
[1:39:28] your mind. And see, that's what I want
[1:39:30] to get across to you here tonight.
[1:39:32] You've got to grab a hold of those
[1:39:34] things and to cast them down. Amen.
[1:39:37] Don't even let failure come into your
[1:39:39] mind. Don't even let fear take root into
[1:39:43] your mind. But before it even starts
[1:39:45] there, grab a hold of that thing and do
[1:39:48] yourself a favor and cast it down. I
[1:39:51] know what the devil does. He's coming to
[1:39:54] you all the time and he's trying to get
[1:39:56] you to doubt and trying to get you to
[1:39:58] disbelieve and say you're not able to do
[1:40:01] it and you don't have power over me.
[1:40:04] Amen. And that's a stronghold of the
[1:40:06] devil. And if you believe that devil's
[1:40:09] lie, then he's exactly right. When you
[1:40:12] believe he has power over you, then he
[1:40:15] has power over you. But see, the Bible
[1:40:17] tells you in the New Testament that we
[1:40:19] are kings and priests unto our God.
[1:40:24] Amen. Now, a priest in the Old
[1:40:26] Testament, there is nothing higher,
[1:40:28] Amen. Levitical order than a priest. And
[1:40:31] a king, Amen, and a king in world order,
[1:40:34] there's nothing higher than a king. So
[1:40:37] what God was telling you that you're
[1:40:39] kings and priests unto God, he's letting
[1:40:42] you know, hey, there ain't nothing that
[1:40:44] is above you. Amen. There is nothing
[1:40:47] that is higher than you, but you are
[1:40:49] kings and you are priests unto God.
[1:40:53] Amen. Why don't you remind the devil
[1:40:55] tonight? Amen. Devil, you are not above
[1:40:58] me, but I am above you. Devil, you are
[1:41:01] not higher than me, but I am higher than
[1:41:04] you.
[1:41:08] And what's the devil trying to say? No,
[1:41:09] you're not.
[1:41:11] No, you're not. You You just think you
[1:41:13] are. Say, "Devil, it's right here in the
[1:41:15] word. And I believe what God has said
[1:41:17] over it. I don't care what you've got to
[1:41:20] say." And see, that's the thing about
[1:41:21] it. God's word is God's word. No matter
[1:41:23] what condition you're in, if you're
[1:41:26] weak, you're still a king and priest. If
[1:41:29] you're discouraged, you're still a king
[1:41:30] and priest. If you're backsliding,
[1:41:35] If you're backsliding, you are still a
[1:41:38] son of God. You are still above the
[1:41:40] devil.
[1:41:43] It don't matter what condition you're
[1:41:44] in. You say, "I need a scripture for
[1:41:47] that." Look at the prodal. Look at the
[1:41:49] prodal. He said, "I know. All I've got
[1:41:52] to do is go home and my father will
[1:41:56] still be there.
[1:41:58] Shake yourself tonight.
[1:42:01] Your kings and priests unto God. Amen.
[1:42:04] There ain't a devil that's above the
[1:42:06] church of the living God. Amen. Let me
[1:42:08] just proclaim tonight. You're above
[1:42:10] every spirit of this world. You're above
[1:42:13] every devil in hell. Amen. Every spirit
[1:42:16] you want to name, you're above it.
[1:42:19] [Music]
[1:42:21] What the angels say, not even cancer
[1:42:23] will stand before your prayer if they
[1:42:25] believe. Let me tell you. Amen. There
[1:42:28] ain't a devil in hell that can stand
[1:42:30] before your prayer if you believe.
[1:42:36] That's right. Amen. Amen. Who you going
[1:42:38] to listen to?
[1:42:40] Are you going to listen to what the
[1:42:41] devil's telling you? I know this is
[1:42:43] simple, but it's what God's put on my
[1:42:44] heart. You going to listen to what the
[1:42:46] devil's telling to you tonight? Listen,
[1:42:48] can I tell you what the prophet said? He
[1:42:49] said, "You can't help them crows flying
[1:42:52] over.
[1:42:54] I can't help it. You can't help it."
[1:42:56] Amen. Remember in that meeting, there
[1:42:57] was a man that came to Brother Brandham.
[1:42:59] He said, "Brother Bram, listen. I was
[1:43:00] having all these bad thoughts about you
[1:43:03] and I was having these negative
[1:43:04] thoughts. Amen. Criticizing you." He
[1:43:06] said, "Brother Bram, I just want to
[1:43:08] apologize for that." Brother said, "Sir,
[1:43:10] listen, that was not your thoughts. But
[1:43:13] there was another man that was in that
[1:43:16] meeting and he was criticizing what God
[1:43:19] was doing. And that spirit that was on
[1:43:21] him got on you. That is not your socks.
[1:43:27] Listen, the devil's been bringing
[1:43:29] thoughts to your mind and all of these
[1:43:31] things. Listen, those are not your
[1:43:33] thoughts. That's what the devil's
[1:43:36] putting into your mind and he's trying
[1:43:38] to get you to think that those are your
[1:43:40] thoughts, but they're not your thoughts.
[1:43:43] That's what the devil's trying to do.
[1:43:46] That's the truth. Amen. That's why the
[1:43:48] prophet said you're a spirit. He said,
[1:43:51] you come into the house of God, let me
[1:43:52] just preach for a moment. I mean, you
[1:43:54] get a negative spirit on you or you get
[1:43:57] I tell you what, I just ain't entering
[1:43:59] into the service tonight. I don't care
[1:44:00] how they sing. I don't care how they
[1:44:02] preach. I'm not lifting my hands. I'm
[1:44:04] not amening. I'm not Amen. Sour, sour,
[1:44:07] sour. And you walk into the house of God
[1:44:10] in that condition. Amen. You realize
[1:44:12] you're a spirit.
[1:44:14] You're a spirit. And if you're not
[1:44:16] careful, that influence will jump onto
[1:44:19] another person. And now the song leader,
[1:44:22] the song leader's got to pay for it and
[1:44:25] the preacher has to pay for it and the
[1:44:29] church has to pay for it.
[1:44:33] That's the truth. Listen, I don't want
[1:44:35] you to have to pick up my slack. I don't
[1:44:38] want the song to have to pick up my
[1:44:40] slack because I realize, Amen. I don't
[1:44:43] have to be the prophet. I can be the
[1:44:44] minstrel.
[1:44:46] A direct quote actually. He said, "If
[1:44:49] you can't be the prophet, be the
[1:44:51] minstrel." Amen. Watch the minstrel, the
[1:44:53] musician. Amen. And put your parts.
[1:44:57] Amen. Put your part. Amen. See what the
[1:44:59] Bible says in Acts. That they were in
[1:45:01] one mind and they was in one accord.
[1:45:04] Everybody was there to hear from God.
[1:45:07] Everybody was there, Amen, to see God
[1:45:10] move in the power of his resurrection.
[1:45:13] It was all in one mind and one accord
[1:45:16] and had one objective. And that was to
[1:45:19] see him in the power of his
[1:45:21] resurrection. And the prophet said if we
[1:45:25] can get in one mind and one accord, he
[1:45:28] said you can see a repeat of the day of
[1:45:31] Pentecost.
[1:45:33] That's what he said. He said you can
[1:45:35] have a repeat of Pentecost.
[1:45:39] So take them critical spirits and go
[1:45:41] shoe them out the door.
[1:45:44] I don't get why it's got to be. Just go
[1:45:46] shoe that out the door. I just wish they
[1:45:48] would do it different. Just go shoe that
[1:45:50] out the door.
[1:45:52] Oh, it's just the truth. It's a
[1:45:55] stronghold that the devil's trying to
[1:45:57] bring into the church and it'll turn
[1:46:00] brother against brother and brother
[1:46:02] against pastor and sister against this
[1:46:05] one and that against that one. And what
[1:46:07] is it? It's the stronghold of the devil.
[1:46:10] Amen. Let me just preach here for a
[1:46:12] moment. The devil has got the church
[1:46:14] world out there. Amen. He's got the
[1:46:17] denominational system. He's got
[1:46:19] deception by the hundreds of thousands.
[1:46:22] But there's a little group of people
[1:46:24] that's on the face of the planet. And
[1:46:26] he's got every target aimed on you and
[1:46:30] I.
[1:46:32] I tell you what, church, that's
[1:46:35] powerful. He's got every church, and
[1:46:38] that's why he's aimed his crosshairs on
[1:46:41] your life. Amen. You wonder why you're
[1:46:43] battling so much? It's because the devil
[1:46:46] realizes who you are. Even if you don't
[1:46:49] realize who you are,
[1:46:51] the devil realized when Messiah was born
[1:46:55] in the manger and he moved upon Herod
[1:46:58] and said, "Go kill all the babies. Hurry
[1:47:00] and stop the program of God." But the
[1:47:03] prophet said, "God is always a step
[1:47:06] ahead of the devil." Let me tell you
[1:47:09] something, church. It don't matter what
[1:47:11] crosshair is on you. It don't matter if
[1:47:14] every devil in hell is against you. If
[1:47:17] God is for you,
[1:47:20] who can be against you? I say the
[1:47:23] devil's in hell. They can howl and they
[1:47:25] can scream and they can do what they
[1:47:28] want to. I mean, and the devil says we
[1:47:30] won't make it. I say, "Watch me.
[1:47:35] The devil says there ain't going to be
[1:47:36] no rapture. You're not good enough." I
[1:47:38] say, "Watch me." The devil says, "You
[1:47:40] can't do the greater works." I say watch
[1:47:43] me. The devil says you won't be able to
[1:47:45] overcome every spirit that is in hell. I
[1:47:48] say devil, Amen. Watch me do it because
[1:47:51] greater is he that is in me.
[1:47:57] Don't watch me do it, but watch him in
[1:48:00] me do it. Let me tell you what, Jesus
[1:48:03] has got no problem living according to
[1:48:06] his word. And the more that I can
[1:48:09] surrender, the more he can live through
[1:48:12] my life.
[1:48:14] It is Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[1:48:16] It's Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[1:48:19] It's Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[1:48:22] What is the hope of the church? Christ
[1:48:24] in you. What is the hope of the
[1:48:27] ministry? It's Christ in you. What is
[1:48:30] the hope of the rapture? It's Christ in
[1:48:33] you.
[1:48:35] I say, what do we do? We surrender,
[1:48:37] amen, to the power of the Holy Spirit.
[1:48:42] That's the purpose of God. Not to have
[1:48:44] preeminence in the world, but to have
[1:48:47] preeminence in his church.
[1:48:51] What house will you build me? But a body
[1:48:54] hast thou prepared for me? Where is the
[1:48:57] place of my dwelling? Where is the home
[1:48:59] of my habitation? I say, "King Jesus, it
[1:49:02] ain't much. But this is all I've got to
[1:49:05] offer. This house may be broken. This
[1:49:08] house may be beaten. This house may be
[1:49:10] weak. But Lord, you're welcome to live
[1:49:12] in this temple." And Jesus responds
[1:49:15] tonight and says, "I don't care what
[1:49:17] shape it's in. I don't care if it's
[1:49:19] broken. I don't care if it's
[1:49:21] discouraged. I don't care if it's sick.
[1:49:23] If you'll surrender to me, I will gladly
[1:49:26] inhabit that house.
[1:49:31] [Applause]
[1:49:33] You said, "Brother S, you you you just
[1:49:35] don't know what I'm going through." Get
[1:49:36] Jesus in the house.
[1:49:39] And he'll just start cleaning.
[1:49:42] But brother, my life ain't perfect. Just
[1:49:43] surrender and get him in the house.
[1:49:46] He'll just start cleaning. And before
[1:49:48] you know it, the living room is clean.
[1:49:51] All the strongholds are broken off.
[1:49:53] Hallelujah. And the fragrance of your
[1:49:56] life begins to pour out of you.
[1:49:59] Hallelujah. Amen. The fragrance from the
[1:50:02] crushing and all of the battles and all
[1:50:05] of the struggles. Amen. It begins to
[1:50:07] free. Amen. Begins to freely push out on
[1:50:11] the outside.
[1:50:14] Hallelujah.
[1:50:17] Amen. Beat that devil down and say,
[1:50:20] "God's got it in control."
[1:50:23] Amen. Tell that devil, "Get out of
[1:50:25] here." Amen. God's got it in control.
[1:50:28] Amen. Listen. Break the strongholds of
[1:50:30] the devil tonight. Amen. Who told you
[1:50:33] you couldn't do it? Was that God or the
[1:50:36] devil? Who told you you couldn't make
[1:50:39] it? Was that God or the devil? Who told
[1:50:42] you you wasn't able? Is that God or the
[1:50:44] devil? Who told you the bride can't do
[1:50:47] the greater works? Is that God or the
[1:50:49] devil? Who told you you're not good
[1:50:51] enough and you won't be able to
[1:50:53] withstand it? God or the devil? Y'all
[1:50:56] know what I'm talking about. Amen.
[1:50:59] Discern between it. Amen. See, I heard a
[1:51:02] saying from Amen. I I know he had
[1:51:04] partial light, but Amen. the prophet
[1:51:06] mentioned his name, Charles Spurgeon
[1:51:07] made a powerful quote. I saw he said,
[1:51:09] "True discernment ain't realizing. It's
[1:51:11] not discernment between right and
[1:51:13] wrong." He said, "It's discernment
[1:51:15] between right and almost right."
[1:51:18] I thought that's pretty good
[1:51:21] between what's right and almost right.
[1:51:22] See, the devil will bring you an offer.
[1:51:25] He'll bring you something that sounds
[1:51:27] kind of good. You can keep preaching if
[1:51:29] you just accept what we do. You You can
[1:51:31] keep pre you can keep the church doors.
[1:51:33] You can keep the church doors open.
[1:51:35] You'll come underneath organization and
[1:51:37] and the devil will make you an offer.
[1:51:40] He'll make you an offer. I tell you
[1:51:42] what, y'all can go out and go worship.
[1:51:44] Y'all can go out outside of Egypt and go
[1:51:47] worship, but just stay where I can see
[1:51:49] you.
[1:51:51] Y'all know what I'm talking about. Book
[1:51:52] of Exodus. Just stay where I can see
[1:51:54] you. Amen. Moses said, "Listen, we we're
[1:51:57] no deal. We're not doing that." See, the
[1:52:00] devil will let you go so far, but he
[1:52:03] always wants to keep his his hands on
[1:52:05] you a little bit. You can go worship,
[1:52:07] just don't go too far.
[1:52:10] See what it is? He wants to keep a
[1:52:12] stronghold on your life. Amen. If I was
[1:52:15] you, I'd look to the devil and say,
[1:52:17] "Devil, no deal." I'm not tell you you
[1:52:20] know what you you can go to the house of
[1:52:22] God, but just don't get too free. No
[1:52:25] deal. You can go to the house of God,
[1:52:27] but just don't enter into the word and
[1:52:29] enter into the worship. No deal, devil.
[1:52:32] I'm not taking your deal cuz you always
[1:52:34] got strings attached.
[1:52:37] [Music]
[1:52:39] That's the truth. Amen. That's what
[1:52:41] Moses told him. That's we're not doing
[1:52:44] that. Well, y'all can go, but but you
[1:52:47] know, just just leave just leave some of
[1:52:49] the hooves and leave some of, you know,
[1:52:50] leave some of the cattle here for us.
[1:52:53] Moses said, "Listen, we're leaving this
[1:52:55] place. We're taking all the cattle.
[1:52:58] We're taking all the children. We're
[1:53:00] taking all the elderly. We're taking our
[1:53:02] children. We're taking our loved ones."
[1:53:05] Amen. Listen, I think it's time we get
[1:53:06] some more Moses's. And let's make a
[1:53:09] declaration tonight. Amen. I'm not
[1:53:11] leaving my children behind. I'm not
[1:53:14] leaving my loved ones behind. I refuse
[1:53:16] to let go. I refuse to lose hope. But
[1:53:20] I'm going and I'm taking them with me.
[1:53:25] And confess it with your mouth.
[1:53:29] Amen. Don't just think about it, but
[1:53:31] confess it with your mouth and say, "I'm
[1:53:33] bringing my children with me. I will not
[1:53:36] lose them, but I claim them in the name
[1:53:39] of Jesus. I claim my family. I claim my
[1:53:43] loved ones. I claim my brothers and I
[1:53:45] claim my sister." You say, "Oh,
[1:53:47] preacher, I don't know about that."
[1:53:49] Well, let me tell you about amen. A
[1:53:51] sister of the name of Rahab.
[1:53:56] You just put a scarlet cord outside of
[1:53:59] your house and it'll be a token to you
[1:54:02] and I'm going to break down all the
[1:54:04] walls that's surround you. In other
[1:54:06] words, all of the past life that you had
[1:54:08] in this city, all of the strongholds
[1:54:11] that you've got, every every temptation,
[1:54:14] every trial, I'm going to take all of
[1:54:16] that around you and you just set forth
[1:54:19] the token.
[1:54:22] You just put out the token and you and
[1:54:24] your household will be I just love the
[1:54:27] Bible said it that way. Not just you,
[1:54:29] brother John, but you and your
[1:54:32] household.
[1:54:33] You and your household. And you know the
[1:54:36] Bible says that her house was the only
[1:54:39] thing standing. And let me just tell
[1:54:42] you, brother, sister, amen, those that
[1:54:44] have the token applied, which is the
[1:54:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost, this world
[1:54:50] may be crumbling or falling apart, but
[1:54:53] your household will remain.
[1:54:58] Amen. You believe that tonight?
[1:55:00] Amen. We'll turn a corner here and bring
[1:55:02] it to a close shortly. But see, Amen.
[1:55:04] Cast down those imaginations.
[1:55:07] Amen. Cast it from your mind.
[1:55:10] Amen. There was a story I heard one
[1:55:11] time, maybe you're familiar with it.
[1:55:12] There was a story of a man had termites
[1:55:15] coming to his home or he had a friend
[1:55:17] over, actually had a friend over. How
[1:55:19] the story went and there was a termite
[1:55:21] in his home and the friend noticed a
[1:55:22] termite. Ain't it something that your
[1:55:24] neighbors normally notice something
[1:55:26] before you notice it? And you may think
[1:55:29] you don't, but your pastor notices stuff
[1:55:31] before you think you notice it.
[1:55:34] [Applause]
[1:55:36] Sorry, but it's the truth.
[1:55:38] Amen. You think that you're slipping by
[1:55:40] and it's easy and nobody's seeing.
[1:55:42] Nobody's noticing. People people notice.
[1:55:46] Your neighbor notices. Your friends
[1:55:48] notice. Anyway, you take that and do
[1:55:51] something with it, I guess. But this man
[1:55:53] said, "Hey, you got a termite in your
[1:55:55] home. You better call somebody and get
[1:55:56] this taken care of." And the man said,
[1:55:57] "Well, you know, I guess I'll call the
[1:55:59] exterminator and see what he says." Had
[1:56:01] the exterminator come out to the home
[1:56:02] and he said, "Well, sir, I tell you
[1:56:04] what, you just got two termites here.
[1:56:06] It's not infestation, but but you you
[1:56:08] need to deal with this because if you
[1:56:10] don't, you'll have to pay for it later.
[1:56:12] That's it. If you don't, you'll have to
[1:56:14] deal with it later. And he said, you
[1:56:16] know, it's just two little termites. It
[1:56:18] ain't going to hurt nothing. And I'll
[1:56:20] just keep an eye on him and just watch
[1:56:22] him and be sure nothing bad happens. And
[1:56:24] so this man, of course, like any of us
[1:56:25] will would have completely forgot about
[1:56:27] it. And so the man completely forgot
[1:56:29] about it. And then one day, he was
[1:56:31] walking through his home and the and the
[1:56:32] floor began to give out from underneath
[1:56:34] him. He thought, "What in the world's
[1:56:35] going on?" And this be to creek and this
[1:56:37] be to pop. He thought, "I've got crazy
[1:56:39] problem. Let me let me call that
[1:56:41] exterminator back." Called the
[1:56:42] exterminator back and all the floor
[1:56:44] joist was rotten out and the wood had
[1:56:46] been eaten out. And the exterminator
[1:56:48] looked at him and said, "Sir, I told you
[1:56:50] to deal with this thing while there was
[1:56:53] only two termites and now you've got to
[1:56:55] get a whole entire house rebuilt because
[1:56:59] of your negligence.
[1:57:01] because you didn't deal with this while
[1:57:03] it was minor. Now that it's major,
[1:57:06] you've got just a catastrophe of a
[1:57:09] problem on your hand. You say,
[1:57:10] "Preacher, what are you saying?" I'm
[1:57:12] saying that's how the devil works in
[1:57:14] your life. He'll take something so small
[1:57:18] and so innocent. But see, it's a
[1:57:21] stronghold waiting to happen. And before
[1:57:24] you know it, the whole house is caving
[1:57:26] in. And before you know it, Legion was
[1:57:29] out there cutting himself. And Legion
[1:57:31] was out there, amen, living amongst the
[1:57:33] tombs. And the prophet says, see what
[1:57:35] Legion did as he told a lie one day.
[1:57:39] Then he took a social drink one day. He
[1:57:41] said, "A devil came. A devil came." And
[1:57:44] before you know it, he said he was so
[1:57:46] overtaken by devils. Amen. He was so
[1:57:50] tied down by strongholds,
[1:57:52] he was beyond help.
[1:57:55] He was beyond help. But I tell you what,
[1:57:58] there was a seed of God that was in that
[1:58:00] man. And Jesus said, "Hey guys, I've got
[1:58:03] a need to go by Gera." And Jesus went
[1:58:06] into that city because there was a man
[1:58:09] that was tied down by all kinds of
[1:58:12] strongholds. But Jesus knew who he was.
[1:58:15] And he went down to that man that could
[1:58:18] not help himself. Amen. And and them
[1:58:20] devils begin to cry out and said, "Why
[1:58:22] have you come to torment us before our
[1:58:24] before the time?
[1:58:26] Don't just cast us out, but give us
[1:58:28] somebody else to work through.
[1:58:31] That's right. The devil always wants
[1:58:34] somewhere to go. And then what did Jesus
[1:58:37] do? He did an all night prayer meeting.
[1:58:39] And that's not what he did. But Jesus
[1:58:41] said, "Go." And all the devils left the
[1:58:44] man. And the prophet said that that man
[1:58:46] went home to his family and he was in
[1:58:49] his right mind.
[1:58:52] But see, where did it start from? It
[1:58:54] started from this thing. Yes, sir. This
[1:58:56] thing and this thing. See, see what the
[1:58:59] Bible says. It's the little foxes that
[1:59:01] spoil the vine.
[1:59:04] It's the little things. Listen. Amen.
[1:59:06] When you're just
[1:59:08] I'm just going to obey the Lord for a
[1:59:09] moment. When you're just dating it, it's
[1:59:11] one thing.
[1:59:14] When you're just dating it, you know
[1:59:16] it's not that big of a deal. But when
[1:59:17] you're married to it,
[1:59:21] it's a world of iniquity.
[1:59:23] It's a world of problems. Amen. When
[1:59:26] you're just dating, you know, it's not
[1:59:28] that serious, not that big of a deal.
[1:59:30] But when you're married to it, and see
[1:59:33] that's what the devil Can I just quote
[1:59:34] to you, prophet? He said, "A believer
[1:59:37] under no circumstances should marry an
[1:59:42] unbeliever." See, if the devil can't get
[1:59:45] you here to try to get you here, you
[1:59:48] say, "Oh, but he's so nice and he's
[1:59:50] this.
[1:59:52] I don't care how nice he is. Amen. If he
[1:59:56] don't live his life according to the
[1:59:57] word, you don't want that kind of man.
[2:00:00] [Applause]
[2:00:01] You don't want that kind of person. If
[2:00:04] she don't live her life according to the
[2:00:06] word, oh, but she's so pretty and he's
[2:00:09] so nice and and that's exactly what the
[2:00:11] devil wants you to be like.
[2:00:15] That's exactly what the devil wants you
[2:00:17] to see just on the outside. Amen. But
[2:00:20] see, the Bible says her pits are the
[2:00:22] pits of hell.
[2:00:24] And the see see what the devil does.
[2:00:27] He's trying to get you in a stronghold.
[2:00:29] Listen, the devil has led to hell many
[2:00:32] and many of the sons of God.
[2:00:35] Ain't that right? Amen. Look there in
[2:00:37] the Old Testament. Amen. It was the sons
[2:00:39] of God went after the daughters of man
[2:00:41] and took unto them wives being led
[2:00:43] astray. Led astray and led astray. Amen.
[2:00:47] led astray by silly women according to
[2:00:49] the Bible. Amen. See, the devil will use
[2:00:52] your emotions and he'll get into your
[2:00:55] emotions. Amen. Now, listen, I'm not
[2:00:57] trying to preach something off on that,
[2:00:59] but the true elect will the true elect
[2:01:01] will not be deceived. We know that
[2:01:03] you're not going to be led astray if
[2:01:05] you're a true, a true gene seed of
[2:01:07] almighty God. Don't misunderstand what
[2:01:08] I'm saying. Amen. But see what the
[2:01:10] devil's trying to do? He'll try to work
[2:01:12] into your emotional realm
[2:01:15] and conscience and Amen. reasons and
[2:01:17] affections and imagination. And you say,
[2:01:19] "But I just feel in my heart. She's the
[2:01:22] one. I just feel. I feel. I feel. I
[2:01:24] feel." That's what the devil wants you
[2:01:27] to do is to feel. But the word don't
[2:01:30] care about feelings. The message don't
[2:01:32] care about feelings. And there was a man
[2:01:35] one time. He said, "Brother, I tell you
[2:01:36] what. God led me to go mar" A woman been
[2:01:39] married two or three times. He said,
[2:01:40] "Brother, I tell you what, God led me.
[2:01:42] He led me to go marry that woman. And I
[2:01:45] tell you, I had a dream and a dream and
[2:01:47] a dream and God led me to go do it. What
[2:01:49] planet do you live on? God ain't leading
[2:01:53] you to do anything that is outside of
[2:01:55] his word.
[2:01:58] You can have dreams and visions and
[2:02:01] lightnings and thunders, but if it don't
[2:02:03] go across this germ of Sommon, it's the
[2:02:07] devil in the lightning. It's the devil
[2:02:08] in the dream. It's the devil in the
[2:02:11] vision. It's the devil in the sign. It's
[2:02:14] the devil in the Janice jambers. If it
[2:02:17] don't line up with this word, throw it
[2:02:20] away, young man. Throw it away, young
[2:02:23] woman. It is the devil trying to snare
[2:02:26] your soul and trying to drag you to
[2:02:29] hell. And he'll do it if you let him.
[2:02:34] Say, "No, sir, devil. I'm not ignorant
[2:02:36] of that. I will not be moved by emotion.
[2:02:40] I will not be moved by fear. But I just
[2:02:42] don't know if I'll meet anybody else. I
[2:02:45] just don't know if there's another fish
[2:02:46] in the sea. I just don't there's a once
[2:02:48] and the devil does that to you. That's
[2:02:52] what the devil wants to do to you. So
[2:02:54] he'll wreck your whole life up and it
[2:02:58] turns into a stronghold of the devil.
[2:03:02] But see, if you just go back to the
[2:03:04] word,
[2:03:06] if you just run that thing back to the
[2:03:08] word, you'll find you'll find what's
[2:03:10] right and wrong.
[2:03:12] You'll say, "Hey, that's the devil doing
[2:03:14] that." That's it. See, the prophet made
[2:03:17] it super simple. He said, "There's only
[2:03:18] two spirits in the world today. It's
[2:03:21] either God or it's either Satan."
[2:03:24] If it don't line up with this word, see
[2:03:26] what the prophet preached a whole sermon
[2:03:28] called thinking man's filter. He said,
[2:03:29] he said, pass that doctrine through the
[2:03:31] filter. He said, and if it gets caught,
[2:03:34] throw that thing away.
[2:03:36] Cast your Amen. Amen. Pass your clothes
[2:03:39] line through the Amen. through the
[2:03:40] filter. And if it gets caught, then
[2:03:43] throw the thing away.
[2:03:45] [Applause]
[2:03:46] Amen. It's just the truth. See, it all
[2:03:49] starts out somewhere.
[2:03:52] Amen. All starts out somewhere. As I
[2:03:54] said, amen. You can't help the birds
[2:03:55] from flying over. You can't help these
[2:03:57] things come to you, but you can stop
[2:03:59] from building a nest.
[2:04:02] Amen. You can stop them things from
[2:04:03] building the nest in your home. And
[2:04:04] listen, let me tell you, maybe there's a
[2:04:06] nest there in your mind already. But
[2:04:08] there was a good man of the house here
[2:04:10] tonight, and he can clean out that nest.
[2:04:13] Amen. He can wash out that nest by the
[2:04:15] water of his word. Amen. Maybe you're so
[2:04:17] jumbled up in your mind and you're going
[2:04:20] in and out and in and out and you're in
[2:04:22] a vicious cycle with your walk with the
[2:04:24] Lord. The Lord can change that thing.
[2:04:27] Amen. He can break that stronghold and
[2:04:30] get you where you need to be. Amen.
[2:04:33] What's the devil say? Amen. Constantly
[2:04:35] bringing lies to you. You went too far
[2:04:38] from God. Grab a hold of that thing and
[2:04:41] cast it down. God ain't hearing your
[2:04:44] prayer. Amen. Grab a hold of that thing
[2:04:46] and cast it down.
[2:04:48] God God don't care about you. Grab a
[2:04:51] hold of that thing and cast it down.
[2:04:53] Amen.
[2:04:55] Hallelujah.
[2:04:57] Don't let the devil bind you.
[2:05:00] Amen. See, the prophet said here in the
[2:05:02] message, God talked to Moses. He said,
[2:05:03] God said, completely destroy that thing.
[2:05:06] He said, what we need today, he said,
[2:05:08] see, you're a baby and you play around
[2:05:10] with a whole lot of things that you
[2:05:11] should be destroying.
[2:05:14] He said, "Well, I'm afraid to testify of
[2:05:16] my healing." He said, "You know what?
[2:05:18] God said, "Destroy that thing." He said,
[2:05:21] "Get that out of your mind and get that
[2:05:24] out of your way."
[2:05:27] Amen. Don't compromise. Don't Don't back
[2:05:30] down to it. The prophet said, "Destroy
[2:05:32] that thing." And we'll preach here for a
[2:05:34] moment, then we'll close. But see, what
[2:05:36] the devil's trying to do to you is to
[2:05:38] bring something to you and plant it in
[2:05:40] your mind. But the prophet said,
[2:05:42] "Destroy your enemy before your enemy
[2:05:46] destroys you."
[2:05:48] Amen. I love it. See, Amen. The prophet
[2:05:50] ran that through Joshua and Caleb. Very
[2:05:52] beautiful. I love that scripture in the
[2:05:54] Bible. Amen. Caleb, the Bible says it
[2:05:56] was of another spirit. I just read that.
[2:05:58] I said, "That's the bride of Christ
[2:06:00] right there. She was of another spirit."
[2:06:03] Amen. And they went in and saw the same
[2:06:05] giants that the rest of the spy saw. Saw
[2:06:08] the same battles. saw the same trials.
[2:06:11] But them other spies, what was their
[2:06:13] report? They said, "We're not able.
[2:06:15] There's too many giants. There's too
[2:06:17] many this. There's too many that." But
[2:06:19] there was two spies that came back with
[2:06:21] the correct report. And they said,
[2:06:23] "Listen, I don't know about what they're
[2:06:24] saying, but all I know is we are more
[2:06:27] than able to take the land. We are more
[2:06:31] than able to possess everything that God
[2:06:35] has promised to us. And we're not going
[2:06:37] to stop short. And we're not going to
[2:06:39] back down. And we're not going to give
[2:06:41] in until we inherit everything that God
[2:06:46] has given us.
[2:06:50] Amen. I don't know about you, but that's
[2:06:51] my heart's desire. Amen. I know there's
[2:06:54] men that try to take these things away
[2:06:56] from the church of God and they try to
[2:06:58] say, "This ain't for the bride. It was
[2:07:00] only for brother Brandham." And my issue
[2:07:02] was with that is where did the prophet
[2:07:04] say that?
[2:07:06] Amen. Men come along and say the greater
[2:07:08] works is not for the bride. I say where
[2:07:11] do the prophets say that? Signs and
[2:07:14] wonders. They you know that was just for
[2:07:16] the prophet. Where do the prophets say
[2:07:17] that? Amen. Our pastor, brother Joshua
[2:07:20] Hol was preaching a sermon and it
[2:07:21] stirred my soul up so much. He began to
[2:07:24] talk about Hannah there in the Old
[2:07:25] Testament how Hannah was barren and the
[2:07:28] Bible says that she refused to be
[2:07:30] comforted until God came on the scene
[2:07:34] and answered her prayer. I thought, "My
[2:07:37] God, what a what a testimony that is."
[2:07:39] Amen. Refuse to be comforted until God
[2:07:43] has came on the scene and answered that
[2:07:45] prayer. Listen, I don't know about you
[2:07:48] all, but I am looking for the
[2:07:49] manifestation of the literal life of
[2:07:52] Jesus Christ in my life.
[2:07:58] In my life, I'm not looking at somebody
[2:08:00] else. In my life, amen. And if I'm not
[2:08:04] seeing it, it is not God's fault. It is
[2:08:06] my fault. It is because I need to die
[2:08:09] out a little bit more. And I need to
[2:08:11] surrender a little bit more. And my
[2:08:13] testimony is like, Hannah, I refuse to
[2:08:16] be comforted.
[2:08:18] Don't try to comfort me. Don't don't try
[2:08:20] to say, "Oh, brother, it'll be okay. You
[2:08:22] know, it'll be all right." I say, "God,
[2:08:24] I want to see the manifestation of the
[2:08:26] life of Christ
[2:08:29] in my life.
[2:08:31] Amen.
[2:08:33] You say, "Preacher, how's that going to
[2:08:34] happen?" By surrendering.
[2:08:39] By surren Let me tell you this. Amen.
[2:08:40] The prophet said, "And musicians, go
[2:08:42] ahead and come."
[2:08:44] Amen. The prophet said, "You take a
[2:08:46] sheep, you don't have to ask him
[2:08:50] to manufacture wool."
[2:08:53] The prophet said, he said, "See what it
[2:08:54] is? It's in his nature.
[2:08:57] It's in his nature. He just puts out
[2:09:00] wool." Amen.
[2:09:02] You said, "Why' the prophet share that?"
[2:09:03] He was to show you you're not
[2:09:04] manufacturing bride.
[2:09:07] You're not manufacturing bride material.
[2:09:10] You are bride material.
[2:09:14] You are bride material.
[2:09:16] And you're going to produce the life of
[2:09:18] Christ. But see, the prophet preached
[2:09:20] sermons and he talked about getting all
[2:09:22] the getting all the channels unclogged
[2:09:24] and getting all the pipes cleaned out.
[2:09:26] He says, "See, ain't no problem with the
[2:09:28] water, but sometimes water gets damned
[2:09:29] up a little bit. What to get damned up
[2:09:31] by by strongholds. Exactly right. The
[2:09:34] biggest stronghold I believe amongst the
[2:09:36] church of the living God is unbelief.
[2:09:39] That's right. Is unbelief.
[2:09:42] You say, "How can you say that?" Well,
[2:09:43] look at the scripture. Lord, I believe,
[2:09:45] but help my unbelief.
[2:09:48] We all Amen. We're all in the constant.
[2:09:51] Lord, I believe. Help my unbelief.
[2:09:55] Lord, I believe that the that that your
[2:09:57] life can so manifest through my life.
[2:09:59] See what the prophet said. He said that
[2:10:01] we are the bride body. He's the head.
[2:10:05] Amen. And the body will do whatsoever
[2:10:07] the head commands. Amen. Do you realize
[2:10:10] that that that Christ and the bride will
[2:10:12] be so close together.
[2:10:15] That's what I don't know about you all
[2:10:16] in this church, but that's what I want.
[2:10:19] I don't want to have the most perfect
[2:10:21] preaching or the most perfect theology
[2:10:23] or the most I I want to be able to show
[2:10:25] the the life of Christ on manifestation
[2:10:30] more than anything. Brother Richard
[2:10:31] Douglas, he's always just a younger man.
[2:10:33] I'm a young man now, but as a younger
[2:10:35] man, he said something that always stuck
[2:10:36] with me. He said, "I'm not worried about
[2:10:38] being the best preacher. I'm worried
[2:10:40] about being the best Christian."
[2:10:43] I said, "Lord, let that be me. I ain't
[2:10:46] worried about all that. Lord, I'll be
[2:10:47] what you want me to be. I don't care. I
[2:10:49] don't care about being the best. I'll be
[2:10:51] what you want me to be and I'll work.
[2:10:52] I'll work in the capacity you let me
[2:10:54] work in. But I know one thing. I want to
[2:10:57] reflect your life as the moon reflects
[2:11:00] the sun. Lord, let me reflect
[2:11:03] everything. Let me reflect your
[2:11:05] sternness on the word. Let me reflect
[2:11:08] your justice. Let me reflect your grace.
[2:11:11] Let me reflect your mercy. Amen. Amen.
[2:11:14] Listen, true spiritual maturity is not
[2:11:17] your knowledge of the message. No, sir.
[2:11:20] It's not your knowledge of the Bible.
[2:11:22] Amen. That's not true spiritual
[2:11:24] maturity. If it was, the Pharisees would
[2:11:26] have us all whipped a million miles.
[2:11:29] True spiritual maturity for the bride of
[2:11:32] Christ is manifesting
[2:11:35] this message. It's manifesting the
[2:11:39] literal life of Jesus Christ on display.
[2:11:43] You say, "What is a mature Christian?"
[2:11:45] It's a Christian full of love. It's a
[2:11:48] Christian full of grace. It's a
[2:11:50] Christian full of mercy.
[2:11:53] Now, I know people think the message is
[2:11:55] legalism, but this is a message of
[2:11:57] grace. And actually, when the headstone
[2:11:59] came down, it came crying grace, grace
[2:12:01] unto it. It was a message of pardon. It
[2:12:04] was a message of grace. And see the
[2:12:07] thing about it is is grace will write
[2:12:09] you in when everybody else wrote you
[2:12:11] out.
[2:12:12] Grace will write you back in when
[2:12:14] everybody else wrote you out. And see
[2:12:16] that's the grace I want to have and the
[2:12:18] mercy I want to have.
[2:12:21] I don't want to be tied and bound down
[2:12:23] by strongholds of the devil. I say,
[2:12:26] Lord, I want to surrender to you
[2:12:27] tonight. Amen. Stand to your feet if you
[2:12:29] will.
[2:12:31] Amen. I believe he's here tonight to
[2:12:33] break any stronghold. You believe that?
[2:12:35] Amen.
[2:12:38] Amen. I believe he's here tonight.
[2:12:40] No matter what the stronghold is. Amen.
[2:12:43] Let me just let me just say this. Don't
[2:12:45] get there in the first place.
[2:12:48] Don't get in that condition in the first
[2:12:50] place. Don't get to where you're Amen.
[2:12:52] You got a ministry here to help you. You
[2:12:55] got a ministry here that that wants to
[2:12:57] see you spiritually prosper.
[2:13:00] Don't get yourself into into a condition
[2:13:02] to where you just don't know where to
[2:13:04] turn and what to do. While you're
[2:13:05] dealing with something, the Bible says,
[2:13:07] "Today is the day of salvation."
[2:13:10] While you're dealing with something,
[2:13:11] let's Amen. Let's enter into prayer
[2:13:13] together. You ain't got to go into
[2:13:15] detail. Say, "Brother, I I need you to
[2:13:17] pray for me. I'm going through
[2:13:18] something, sister. I need you to pray
[2:13:20] for me. I'm going through something."
[2:13:23] Amen. Listen, I I'm on your side. I'm on
[2:13:26] your pastor's side. We're We're all on
[2:13:28] each other's side as the universal bride
[2:13:30] body of Christ. And most of all, he's on
[2:13:33] our side. And let me tell you this, he's
[2:13:35] going to see this thing through.
[2:13:38] Amen. He's going to see this thing
[2:13:40] through on your best days, on your worst
[2:13:42] days. This is our unstoppable bride.
[2:13:47] Amen. God bless you tonight. I I pray I
[2:13:50] pray this. I know it's all scattered
[2:13:52] out. I tr I trust you take something
[2:13:54] home with you tonight.
[2:13:57] Amen. God bless you tonight.
[2:14:05] Amen. If there's anything to take home
[2:14:07] with you, grab a hold of that
[2:14:09] imagination and cast it down. See, it's
[2:14:13] easy when you're in an atmosphere like
[2:14:14] this to talk about it. But see, when you
[2:14:16] go home and you're by yourself and
[2:14:18] nobody's around and that old man devil
[2:14:20] come, y'all know what I'm talking about.
[2:14:22] that old shadow begins to move around
[2:14:24] you, just lift your hand and say, "In
[2:14:27] Jesus Christ's name,
[2:14:29] I grab a hold of you, spirit of fear,
[2:14:32] you spirit of anxiety, you spirit of
[2:14:35] worry, and I cast you down in Jesus
[2:14:37] Christ's name."
[2:14:39] Amen. Brother Steven, come. God bless
[2:14:41] you tonight.
[2:14:43] [Applause]
[2:14:52] Praise God. Praise God. I don't know
[2:14:55] what he's calling scatter sermon,
[2:14:58] but to me, when you're preaching under
[2:15:01] the direction of the Holy Spirit, that
[2:15:03] is the best sermon. Amen. Amen. You
[2:15:07] didn't even hear what I preach on
[2:15:09] Sunday.
[2:15:11] The Holy Spirit took us to Bellum into a
[2:15:14] different channel showing the difference
[2:15:16] between the bride and denomination. And
[2:15:19] here the spirit is coming back again
[2:15:22] clarifying that we are not like the like
[2:15:26] like the denominational churches. Amen.
[2:15:30] Amen. It is clear
[2:15:33] as clear can be. Amen. That's why you
[2:15:36] need to watch what you're listening.
[2:15:40] Watch what type of music you are playing
[2:15:43] because you would say well they're
[2:15:45] playing I feel the anointing. Of course
[2:15:47] Bellam could bring God down. Amen. But
[2:15:50] that is not our music. And brother and
[2:15:53] and the brother preached tonight he say
[2:15:55] it start a little bit a little bit. A
[2:15:58] little bit. Brother Brandham say when
[2:16:00] they put the the the the what feast of
[2:16:02] Balp, brother Brandham say it was a
[2:16:05] feast of worship. Yes. So they invited
[2:16:08] Israel into a worship of denomination
[2:16:12] and brother Brandham say Israel thought
[2:16:14] well we need to go there to witness to
[2:16:16] them. And when they got there they found
[2:16:18] out that the women are dancing different
[2:16:21] than sister Victoria.
[2:16:24] They dancing different than Sister
[2:16:26] Yoken. They dancing different than
[2:16:28] Sister Olivia. In other words, they
[2:16:29] found a different type of women. Amen.
[2:16:33] And before you know it, Israel was drawn
[2:16:35] into a last. You must say, "Brother
[2:16:38] Stephen, I don't go to the it it's even
[2:16:41] a shame when I see message believer
[2:16:44] going into Pentecostal uh I mean
[2:16:47] concert.
[2:16:48] It's even a shame.
[2:16:51] I'm sorry my friend. If we have to stay
[2:16:53] two people in this church, we will stay
[2:16:55] two people. But in the word, it is even
[2:16:58] a shame. You see message believer going
[2:17:01] to I mean I mean a denominational I mean
[2:17:04] you're going to pick up a spirit.
[2:17:07] Amen. Amen. You might not even go to
[2:17:10] their concert but you are so much
[2:17:12] exposed to their uh I mean clips until
[2:17:17] you begin to get used to women dancing a
[2:17:20] certain way, shaking their hips and
[2:17:22] everything. And before you know it, a
[2:17:24] lust will rise into a young man until
[2:17:28] our young sister won't attract you
[2:17:30] anymore. You will begin to be attracted
[2:17:33] by women of the world. And you wonder
[2:17:35] where did you get that spirit? It came
[2:17:37] from what we call Pentecostal music.
[2:17:41] I was coming with my wife on the road
[2:17:44] and I told her I say all the sacredness
[2:17:47] Pentecost remove it. When you come to
[2:17:50] preach, we used to dress nice. You dress
[2:17:52] with a tie as a responsible young man.
[2:17:55] When you come to play the instrument,
[2:17:56] you look responsible. But now they got
[2:17:59] groups that came up where you can preach
[2:18:01] like you going to Walmart.
[2:18:04] I mean I mean I mean a pastor is
[2:18:06] preaching with uh sport clothes with a
[2:18:09] t-shirt. So all the sacredness has been
[2:18:12] removed. And if it's a Christian
[2:18:14] concert, guess what? This one is coming
[2:18:17] with shirt.
[2:18:19] I mean which which style is it of you
[2:18:22] wearing a I mean uh I mean I mean a
[2:18:24] shirt and it have to be unbutton
[2:18:27] when we grew up that was a a ghetto we
[2:18:31] knew that if we see you with shirt
[2:18:34] please listen to me if you struggling
[2:18:37] with the world don't come here to sin
[2:18:41] don't even play any instrument here
[2:18:43] don't even come here with a I mean I
[2:18:46] mean I mean any type of style that you
[2:18:49] saw on uh on uh on YouTube and whatever
[2:18:52] and you rep because before you know it
[2:18:54] you begin to get used to it and you
[2:18:56] begin to copy after and you think we
[2:18:58] don't know we've seized that we just sit
[2:19:00] and looking around you we know
[2:19:01] somebody's already struggling my friend
[2:19:04] it is time to go there is a clear
[2:19:07] difference between the bride and
[2:19:10] denomination
[2:19:13] even when you want to pick up a song put
[2:19:15] the song through the filter
[2:19:17] It's a shame you I mean you look it it's
[2:19:21] very a you look at what message believer
[2:19:24] are dancing and you listen to the
[2:19:26] content of the music they dancing you
[2:19:30] ask them you say is this a message
[2:19:32] believer really because you don't even
[2:19:34] pay attention to what they're singing
[2:19:36] what are they singing that is connected
[2:19:38] to Jesus Christ what are they singing
[2:19:41] that is reflecting the message of
[2:19:43] brother Brham
[2:19:45] Amen Amen. Amen. It start like a little
[2:19:48] game. On the clip, on the clip, on the
[2:19:51] clip, on the clip. Before you know it,
[2:19:53] they're normal. Before you know it, you
[2:19:55] get caught into it. Before you know it,
[2:19:57] you begin to dress like them. Before you
[2:19:59] know it, you begin to act like them. And
[2:20:01] when we coming down on that, you're
[2:20:03] like, "What have I done?" Of course, you
[2:20:07] just drifted away. Amen. And because we
[2:20:10] love you, we won't let you go. That's
[2:20:12] right. We will come and strike the devil
[2:20:14] and pull you back up again. Amen. Amen.
[2:20:18] Young people, watch the music you are
[2:20:20] listening to.
[2:20:23] What type of music is only um I mean put
[2:20:26] accent in dancing
[2:20:29] all the time is just joy, joy, joy, joy,
[2:20:32] joy. Come on. What's wrong with you?
[2:20:36] Amen. Amen. You listen to the beat.
[2:20:39] Right. Right. What kind of music you
[2:20:42] start listening to it and you begin to
[2:20:44] go back on. You need to stop and say
[2:20:46] what? Because the beat is the one doing
[2:20:48] that.
[2:20:51] It's saying Jesus Christ, but the beat
[2:20:52] is the one making you shake. But what is
[2:20:55] that kind of beat that make you shake?
[2:20:57] And before, oh no, it's a Christian. So
[2:20:59] it says a devil
[2:21:02] in disguise.
[2:21:05] Amen. Amen. I already have a reputation
[2:21:08] of being tough. So it's no more a
[2:21:10] problem. I'm already have a dire
[2:21:12] reputation. Song leader tighten up.
[2:21:17] Amen.
[2:21:18] No world because brother Brandham say
[2:21:20] Hollywood got into the church through
[2:21:23] musician.
[2:21:25] Do you want me to send you the quote? Do
[2:21:27] you want me to send you the quote?
[2:21:29] Brother Brandham say he got into the
[2:21:31] church through musician through talented
[2:21:33] men. We're not here reproducing uh
[2:21:36] whatever it is. We're here to worship
[2:21:39] Jesus Christ. If my st if our stand

[2:22:38] the end of the day, we all will go into
[2:22:40] the rapture and live forever. If you go
[2:22:43] into the rapture, I'm going to the
[2:22:44] rapture. So, you will never be separated

[2:23:19] warning from God. Amen. Amen. Cling onto
[2:23:24] the word. That's it. Even you don't
[2:23:27] understand it, obey the word. Believe
[2:23:30] the word. Brother said it because later
[2:23:33] on that little termite, that's what you
[2:23:37] use. That little termite that you see
[2:23:39] going slowly, before you know it, you're
[2:23:42] going to find out you have a house full
[2:23:44] of it.
[2:23:46] And now you wonder why. What is going
[2:23:48] on? Watch the music you are listening
[2:23:51] to. Watch the demon that you're
[2:23:53] struggling. God brought that here
[2:23:55] tonight. I have depression. I have this
[2:23:58] this. Watch the beat that is going on.

[2:24:11] phone. Please. God has spoken once. He's
[2:24:15] spoken twice again. Amen.
[2:24:18] Remove all the junk, every thought that
[2:24:22] exalted itself above the knowledge of
[2:24:25] Christ. In other words, you are judging
[2:24:26] that by the knowledge of God. Take it,
[2:24:29] cast it down. Amen. Amen. Let's go back
[2:24:33] again. Let's zeroed in. Brother Solomon,
[2:24:35] that was a wonderful sermon. It is God
[2:24:39] talking.
[2:24:43] Amen.
[2:24:45] Young sister, take your clothing. Put
[2:24:48] that to the filters. Take your shoes.
[2:24:52] Put that through the thinking.
[2:24:55] We need to go home. Amen. We need to go
[2:24:59] home. Amen. You cannot change your
[2:25:02] hairstyle with every hairstyle that is

[2:25:19] many days and some of them are in the
[2:25:21] instrument. They're playing in the
[2:25:23] church. I said please put that man down.
[2:25:26] I mean cut your hair nice.
[2:25:30] They came up with a style. You need to
[2:25:32] leave your beard like that. Then
[2:25:34] tomorrow when they shave the beard what
[2:25:36] are you going to do? And then you go
[2:25:38] ahead and you start shaving. No. If you
[2:25:40] have a style that you leave your beard,
[2:25:42] stay like that.
[2:25:44] So we know you that's the way you are.
[2:25:46] If you shave, shave, stay like that. But
[2:25:48] don't go with the move.
[2:25:51] Today is this. You change. Tomorrow you
[2:25:53] change. Tomorrow you change. How many
[2:25:55] style are you going to change?
[2:25:58] Amen. Amen. How can a hair that look
[2:26:02] kinky and whatever you call it for a man
[2:26:05] and you leave it like that and a woman
[2:26:07] say it's cute.
[2:26:10] Something is wrong. You need to look
[2:26:13] like a clean gentleman. I seen a message
[2:26:16] believer with jeans that are torn and
[2:26:18] they posting it. Married.
[2:26:23] What is wrong? Where are we going? Where
[2:26:26] are we going? There is a difference
[2:26:28] between the bride and Jesus Christ. God
[2:26:31] gave you the power to destroy that
[2:26:33] thing. Cut it off. Throw it away. If
[2:26:37] it's a little child or I I don't know
[2:26:40] how innocent it is, kill it.
[2:26:43] Because if it grows, it's going to be a
[2:26:45] bigger problem to solve than when it's
[2:26:47] little. Are we together? Watch your
[2:26:50] friend. How many friends do you have?
[2:26:53] I'm a doctor. I have colleague, I have
[2:26:57] no friend.
[2:27:00] I'm going to repeat it again. I'm a
[2:27:02] doctor. I have colleague. I have no
[2:27:04] friend because I know if I get among
[2:27:09] with friendship, I know where they hang
[2:27:11] out.
[2:27:13] As doctors, they hang out in night I
[2:27:16] mean I mean in downtown and stuff. I
[2:27:18] cannot hang out there. So I have to stay
[2:27:20] separated and we keep relationship
[2:27:22] between treating people. That's it. My
[2:27:25] friend are the people of the church. So
[2:27:27] what type of friend do you want?
[2:27:31] What type of friend do you want? Amen.
[2:27:34] We look at your friend. They have uh uh
[2:27:36] dresses and all kind of stuff. I will
[2:27:39] wonder because brother Brandham say I
[2:27:41] wonder watch who you hang out with. It
[2:27:43] tells me what the spirit brother
[2:27:45] Brandham say you cannot take two dog and
[2:27:46] one with a flea and you expect the other
[2:27:48] one to be clean. Before you know it,
[2:27:50] this is what you heard tonight. a spirit
[2:27:52] upon somebody and it's going to pick you
[2:27:54] up.
[2:27:56] Amen. Amen. Amen. Stay with the word.
[2:28:00] Amen. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord,
[2:28:04] we are approaching you humbly tonight.
[2:28:06] Father, thanking you for your grace,
[2:28:09] your love, your mercy, and father
[2:28:11] destroying again this thing that were
[2:28:14] trying to attack this church left and
[2:28:17] right. Lord entering through young
[2:28:20] people.
[2:28:22] Father, we thank you for watching over
[2:28:24] us and we thank you for watching over
[2:28:26] our young people because if it was not
[2:28:29] for grace, we don't know where we would
[2:28:31] go be. But your grace have provided the
[2:28:34] word that is coming wave after wave
[2:28:37] destroying the devil completely until
[2:28:40] the whole thing has been rooted out.
[2:28:42] Lord, Father, I claim the blood upon the
[2:28:45] church and I commit each one of us unto
[2:28:48] thy hand and brother Solomon for the
[2:28:50] sacrifice. Lord, may you bless him. May
[2:28:53] Lord, Father, you strengthen him. Lord,
[2:28:55] we rebuke every spirit of worldliness,
[2:28:58] every spirit of denomination, every
[2:29:01] influence that came from a uh a
[2:29:04] so-called contemporary gospel music that
[2:29:07] affect the life of the young one. We
[2:29:10] rebuke that back to hell in the name of
[2:29:13] Jesus Christ. Every spirit of
[2:29:15] resentment, I rebuke it in the name of
[2:29:18] Jesus Christ. Father, may your children
[2:29:20] be totally free.
[2:29:24] Lord, may you protect us and give us
[2:29:27] travel mercy. Father, if that Terry to
[2:29:29] come, may we meet again to fellowship
[2:29:32] around the things of the kingdom. We
[2:29:34] thank you and commit it all unto the
[2:29:36] hand in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:29:40] Go ahead.
