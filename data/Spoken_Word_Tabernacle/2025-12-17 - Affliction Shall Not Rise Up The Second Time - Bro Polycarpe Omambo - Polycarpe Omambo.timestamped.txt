[49:57] My God. Sister Lily. Where was this song
[50:00] all along,
[50:02] &gt;&gt; brother John?
[50:04] &gt;&gt; For five years. Where was this song?
[50:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; These are the song when the building is
[50:12] finished. Jesus the mighty one.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; You know what? Let's put this on Sunday.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Since it's uh it's cold on Sunday,
[50:24] it's usually during winter. We're going
[50:26] to say Jesus the mighty one. You don't
[50:28] know why I rejoice. The devil just
[50:31] attacked the sand and the sand is back
[50:33] again to normal. Who did it? Jesus the
[50:36] mighty one.
[50:40] Wow.
[50:42] Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory.
[50:44] Anointed. God bless you. God bless you.
[50:47] God bless you. Amen.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you all consecrate yourself
[50:52] because on Sunday I don't want to hear
[50:54] any problem. I want to hear Jesus the
[50:56] mighty one from the the the drum from
[50:59] the the the what? Because last Sunday he
[51:02] plays a little bit with the devil and
[51:04] everything and we get back again. No, no
[51:06] more Jesus the sovereign one.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus is doing so many things. So much
[51:17] so
[51:21] &gt;&gt; let me just leave it. Amen.
[51:24] Amen.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; Jesus is doing great great great thing.
[51:31] You see what's going on out there,
[51:33] right?
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; And they told
[51:38] they told me we need to bring because
[51:41] they need to bring the insulation and
[51:42] drop it. These are unexpected bills that
[51:45] are coming. Boop boop. It looks like the
[51:48] devil heard that $18,000. So, he's
[51:50] upset.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:53] And they told and they send a message
[51:55] today. They said they need to deliver
[51:56] the insulation, but they need money
[51:58] right away. We need to give them $12,000
[52:00] something right away. I'm like, woo,
[52:05] after all the great recovery we did,
[52:08] what am I going to do again? I say,
[52:11] okay, no problem. I say, you know what?
[52:12] We got to do what we got to do.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; And then when I came out, but Robert
[52:17] gave me a testimony. There is somebody
[52:19] from the invisible audience who's
[52:21] looking for the address to send money
[52:26] &gt;&gt; to send $5,000.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; You don't know how to clap for God.
[52:39] You don't know how to clap for God.
[52:43] You see what God is doing. Do you see
[52:46] what God is doing? When my mind is
[52:48] spinning trying to figure what to do,
[52:50] someone is calling boop and want to send
[52:53] money.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; So if from 12,000 five is already
[52:58] coming, what do you think the other one?
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; When I see five, I begin to glorify God
[53:04] for 12.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; When I see 12, I glorify him for the
[53:09] next step. Amen. God is teaching you on
[53:14] the pulpit and he's teaching you by an
[53:16] example right there in your face what he
[53:20] can do not only for the church building
[53:22] but he can do for your individual life
[53:26] that how can God take care of the
[53:28] building
[53:29] &gt;&gt; and he doesn't take care of the true
[53:31] building he's he's dwelling in
[53:35] &gt;&gt; if he's taking care of this building
[53:37] what about this building
[53:39] &gt;&gt; what about your housemen
[53:41] Amen.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; Lift up your faith, my friend.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the midst of chaos, people are
[53:48] crying, whatever is going on, I'm not
[53:51] looking at what the national economy is
[53:53] going. I'm looking at the economy of
[53:55] God.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; We greet you all in the precious name of
[54:00] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Both visible and invisible
[54:06] audience. Amen. Any family members here?
[54:10] God richly bless you. And the new
[54:12] subscriber online, God bless you.
[54:14] Invisible audience, I got you uh taken
[54:17] care of. The invisible audience
[54:20] complain.
[54:21] You got a bigger church than this. They
[54:24] says that uh after service they cut the
[54:28] the the streaming too quick and they
[54:31] want to continue worshipping with
[54:33] brother John and whoever is uh leading
[54:36] the song. So I told that I already
[54:38] instructed the technician after service
[54:40] give them at least 15 20 minute they
[54:42] want to continue. Some of them say we
[54:44] want to pray while brother John is
[54:46] singing or brother Tony or whoever is
[54:49] singing. So let's keep them alive.
[54:53] Amen. Give them another 20 minute or so
[54:57] or whatever the Lord lead so they can
[54:59] continue to uh be part of the service.
[55:02] Amen.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Some of them are even coming to
[55:05] visit the church.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; I won't I won't say other thing. I need
[55:08] to block some of them. Let's just leave
[55:10] it alone. You will see it what God is
[55:12] doing. Amen. God is using you to bless
[55:16] people all over the world.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; So you have been blessing people when
[55:19] you pull the word right here. Somebody's
[55:22] getting healed in Australia. Somebody's
[55:24] getting healed in Europe. Somebody's
[55:26] getting healed in America somewhere. You
[55:28] you have no clue until eternity will
[55:30] tell us exactly what is going on. Amen.
[55:33] Because we are in the season of the
[55:35] thunders.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; Now the seven thunders are clear to
[55:39] everybody.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; You see that the thunders are not
[55:41] complicated sir
[55:42] &gt;&gt; until they say thunders. Thunders you
[55:44] wonder what is a thunder. A thunder is
[55:46] the voice of God.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; It is God speaking to us.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why do we follow the message?
[55:54] Because God was veiling a man
[55:56] &gt;&gt; and God was using a man voice to speak.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:03] Uh
[56:05] when when you hear when you listen to
[56:07] the tape
[56:08] &gt;&gt; and the sister prophesy,
[56:10] &gt;&gt; did you ever hear that voice coming a
[56:13] voice of a man?
[56:14] &gt;&gt; What do you hear? You will hear, "Yay,
[56:16] the Lord speak." And it's a woman
[56:18] speaking,
[56:19] &gt;&gt; but it's not a woman.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; It is God.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; Ah, because I say woman, some of you are
[56:27] quiet.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is God who's speaking, who's
[56:31] prophesying through a sister. He's going
[56:34] to use the sister's voice,
[56:36] &gt;&gt; but we know it's not the sister.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; The tone is a woman voice, but it's God.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; So, when we listening to the tape, we're
[56:45] listening to the voice of God.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; It is God who use a vessel. But we know
[56:50] that there is no way a man can interpret
[56:53] the Bible the way brother Brham is
[56:55] interpreting. It must be God. Amen.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; If you begin to discern God not only on
[57:01] a pulpit and on a tape, you will see God
[57:04] on one another.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; You will be talking to a sister and the
[57:07] sister didn't know what is going on and
[57:09] the sister begin to tell you something
[57:11] like you know what I was meditating and
[57:12] it's exactly things that you were
[57:14] pondering at home. How did that sister
[57:16] know what you were pondering at home
[57:18] when you were not when she was not even
[57:19] there with you? It is God confirming you
[57:22] through another sister that I'm there. I
[57:25] was I was hearing I I I was looking at
[57:28] all your meditation and I'm confirming
[57:30] to you that I'm there. Amen.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Learn to see God beyond the veil. Amen.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; So, welcome to our convention. It's a
[57:39] Wednesday one. I'm not preaching. It's
[57:41] brother Polycarp who's going to preach
[57:43] and brother Albert who will be
[57:45] translating. I will be sitting there
[57:47] enjoying and as a backup. So, I told him
[57:49] I say you should be on fire today. Amen.
[57:52] When brother Polycap is here, you are
[57:54] over there. Amen. Amen. So let's sing.
[57:58] Only believe.
[58:08] Oh,
[58:11] believe
[58:16] all things are possible.
[58:23] All
[58:27] believe
[58:46] all things are possible. Ever
[59:03] I
[59:11] believe
[59:16] Jesus.
[59:22] Lord I
[59:25] believe
[59:31] I believe
[59:38] I believe
[59:42] that all
[59:59] Thank you to Miss.
[1:00:02] May God bless you richly.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; For the Bible says
[1:00:08] when you lift the son of man,
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; that's when you'll know who he is.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Who is he?
[1:00:19] He is the one that resurrect the dead.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Who is he?
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; He is the one that changes the
[1:00:27] situation.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; He changes the circumstance.
[1:00:31] He changes the problem.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Just when you lift up his name, the name
[1:00:37] of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.
[1:00:41] When the people heard that name
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; without laying of hand,
[1:00:47] people were receiving the Holy Ghost.
[1:00:51] Those that were sick
[1:00:55] and healed from their sickness.
[1:00:58] That's why it's in our advantage
[1:01:01] to lift up that name,
[1:01:04] the name that knows no failure,
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; the name that does not go back.
[1:01:13] The name of Jesus Christ,
[1:01:16] the name that brings life to what was
[1:01:19] dead.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; May God bless you.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; May God be worshiped.
[1:01:27] greet you all in the name of the Lord
[1:01:29] Jesus Christ.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Even those that follow us online,
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; may God bless you all that we love you.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; I thank the pastor
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; for this opportunity
[1:01:47] that he gave us to make a little bit of
[1:01:49] noise for the Lord.
[1:01:51] May God bless you all.
[1:01:56] If we can read a little bit of something
[1:01:58] as you're all standing.
[1:02:03] Go to the book of Naom chapter one.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Naom
[1:02:10] chapter one.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; In the book of Naom chapter one.
[1:02:20] Verse
[1:02:24] nine.
[1:02:28] We read in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:02:29] Christ.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; What do you imagine against the Lord?
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; He will make an utter end.
[1:02:45] If affliction shall not rise up the
[1:02:48] second time, the second.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; If we could pray.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father,
[1:02:58] creator of heaven and earth,
[1:03:01] you're the one who just came for
[1:03:05] will not appear twice.
[1:03:08] It doesn't matter the circum
[1:03:11] doesn't matter what the enemy
[1:03:14] doesn't matter. the Red Sea
[1:03:17] army of Pharaoh behind.
[1:03:20] Christian shall not arise up.
[1:03:24] You're the one who creates.
[1:03:27] There's someone here. They need to
[1:03:31] create a real
[1:03:34] doesn't matter how squeezed the person
[1:03:36] is.
[1:03:39] They're capable of all things.
[1:03:42] And that's why we're standing here
[1:03:47] lifting my hand
[1:03:50] to show presence that I am
[1:03:53] representing your people.
[1:03:57] This hand represent those that have
[1:04:00] intercession for you
[1:04:04] that needs a conference with you
[1:04:07] that need to talk with you.
[1:04:10] That's why Lord
[1:04:13] wherever when we hear you
[1:04:17] recite your name the Lord
[1:04:20] they accept
[1:04:22] when you bring the solution to the
[1:04:24] problem
[1:04:25] to all your children.
[1:04:28] Lord we're a man.
[1:04:30] Without you we could do nothing.
[1:04:33] May you remove us from the way. You may
[1:04:35] speak to your people.
[1:04:37] May not be our thoughts. may comfort for
[1:04:41] it is written that the evil
[1:04:46] are nurtured from mountain.
[1:04:48] We also want to be nurtured in the name
[1:04:51] of Jesus Christ.
[1:04:53] Cast out any type of evil in the name of
[1:04:56] Jesus Christ
[1:04:58] to be cast
[1:05:01] TO BE REMOVED FROM CAST IN THE NAME OF
[1:05:04] Jesus Christ
[1:05:07] to remember that
[1:05:09] It is the 17th.
[1:05:11] We see the numbers
[1:05:14] and we see the
[1:05:16] for when we add it
[1:05:18] in eternity before
[1:05:21] God may manifest yourself.
[1:05:24] It's not by happen
[1:05:28] when we're presented before.
[1:05:31] May you bless
[1:05:33] to the last room.
[1:05:37] give us the energy pro
[1:05:40] to do your work for we ask in the name
[1:05:44] of Jesus Christ.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.
[1:05:50] Our
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; subject this evening
[1:05:58] affliction shall not rise up the second
[1:06:00] time.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:06] All it takes maybe you went through a
[1:06:08] trial,
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; you went through a problem,
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; but the affliction will not rise up the
[1:06:16] second time.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; That is not a man's word.
[1:06:22] But it's the word of God, the creator,
[1:06:25] the author of life,
[1:06:28] the master of circumstance and time.
[1:06:33] He is capable of all things
[1:06:38] like
[1:06:40] of affliction.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; It's a feeling of abandonment
[1:06:47] of solitary
[1:06:52] of being in powerless in front of a
[1:06:55] situation that we find difficult
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; of a danger or a suffering. Amen. Amen.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; So, it's a place where you feel
[1:07:08] abandoned. That's right.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; A desperate situation. That's right.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; A great pain in the spirit. That's
[1:07:21] right.
[1:07:23] A pain in the heart
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; caused by excessive pressure
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; and difficult
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; of circumstance
[1:07:35] that are traumatizing or heartache
[1:07:38] heartaching.
[1:07:48] And usually that's also spoken of when
[1:07:50] we see boats or airplanes.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; When those when their agents are in
[1:07:59] dangerous situations, dangerous places,
[1:08:05] imagine there's an airplane up in the
[1:08:07] air and there's a situation.
[1:08:09] people are inside
[1:08:12] or they may feel in that
[1:08:16] they'll find themselves in distress.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; Same thing also with the boat in the
[1:08:21] water.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; That you do not know when you may go.
[1:08:30] You find yourself in a difficult
[1:08:31] situation.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:35] That's why the Lord is telling
[1:08:38] it doesn't matter what situation you
[1:08:40] find yourself in
[1:08:43] affliction shall not rise up the second
[1:08:46] time in your life.
[1:08:56] The book of Jonah chapter one.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; Jonah chapter one.
[1:09:13] Jump or
[1:09:15] I'll read a little bit fast.
[1:09:24] Now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah
[1:09:26] the son of Amiti
[1:09:28] saying
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Arise and go to Nineveh that great city
[1:09:39] and cry against it for their wickedness
[1:09:42] is come up before me.
[1:09:46] Fore!
[1:09:48] Foreign! Foreign!
[1:10:05] But Jonah But Jonah rose up to flee unto
[1:10:08] Tarses from the presence of the Lord,
[1:10:11] and went down to Jopah, and found a ship
[1:10:13] going to Tarses. So he paid the fair
[1:10:16] thereof, and went down into it to go
[1:10:19] with them unto Tarses from the presence
[1:10:22] of the Lord.
[1:10:33] But the Lord sent out a great wind into
[1:10:36] the sea, and there was a mighty tempest
[1:10:38] in the sea, so that the ship was like to
[1:10:40] be broken.
[1:11:03] Then the then the mariners were afraid
[1:11:06] and cried every man unto his God and
[1:11:09] cast forth the words that were in the
[1:11:11] ship into the sea to lighten it of them.
[1:11:15] But Jonah was gone down into the sides
[1:11:17] of the sheep, and he lay and was fast
[1:11:20] asleep.
[1:11:33] So the shipmaster came to him and said
[1:11:35] unto him, "What meanest thou, oh
[1:11:38] sleeper? Arise, call up, call upon thy
[1:11:41] God, if so be that God will think upon
[1:11:44] us that we perish not."
[1:11:56] And they said everyone to his fellow,
[1:11:59] "Come and let us cast lots that we may
[1:12:01] know for whose cause this evil is upon
[1:12:04] us." So they cast lots, and the law fell
[1:12:07] upon Jonah.
[1:12:21] In verse eight, then say they unto him,
[1:12:24] tell us, tell us, we pray thee, for
[1:12:27] whose cause is this evil upon us? What
[1:12:30] is thy occupation?
[1:12:32] And when comest thou? What is thy
[1:12:35] country? And what people art thou?
[1:12:47] And he said unto them, "I am a Hebrew,
[1:12:50] and I fear the Lord, the God of heaven,
[1:12:53] which have made the sea and the dry
[1:12:55] land.
[1:13:08] Then were the men exceedingly afraid,
[1:13:10] and said unto him, Why hast thou done
[1:13:13] this? For the men knew that he fled from
[1:13:16] the presence of the Lord because he had
[1:13:18] told him.
[1:13:29] Thus say they unto him, what shall we do
[1:13:32] unto thee, that the sea may become unto
[1:13:36] us? For the sea wrought and was temp
[1:13:40] tempted.
[1:13:54] And he said unto them, "Take me up and
[1:13:56] cast me forth into this into the sea. So
[1:13:59] shall the sea become unto you, for I
[1:14:02] know that for my sake this great tempest
[1:14:05] is upon you."
[1:14:10] May God add more blessing to the lecture
[1:14:13] of his word.
[1:14:17] Our
[1:14:20] subjection are subject that the
[1:14:22] affliction shall not rise up the second
[1:14:24] time. Amen.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; We just came from reading in Jonah.
[1:14:36] We just came from seeing that Jonah is a
[1:14:38] prophet.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Who is Jonah?
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; He's a prophet.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; He's a servant of God. He's a pastor.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; He's an evangelist.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; He's a deacon in the church.
[1:14:52] He's a singer.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; He's a brother in the church.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; HE IS A CHRISTIAN. BUT NOW,
[1:15:01] he has a mission
[1:15:03] and he ran away from the mission from
[1:15:04] God AND HE WAS CALLED UPON.
[1:15:08] He was called over here the the doors of
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; of curses.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Now in this context that Jonah a man of
[1:15:22] God
[1:15:26] now he became a door of curses.
[1:15:32] a pastor, an evangelist,
[1:15:34] a Christian
[1:15:37] BECOME A STUDENT FOR HIS BRETHREN.
[1:15:44] There was a lot of sin in Nineveh
[1:15:48] and God had mandate him.
[1:15:52] God cannot judge a man
[1:15:56] if he does not PRESENT YOU HIS WORDS
[1:15:58] FIRST.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; IF HE does not WARN YOU FIRST,
[1:16:03] BECAUSE GOD IS JEALOUS OF HIS SIGNATURE.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS THAT HIS SON OR HIS daughter
[1:16:12] is representing him.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; So when his daughter or his son
[1:16:19] does something WRONG OR
[1:16:22] GOD IS jealous of his savior,
[1:16:26] he will do everything so he can save.
[1:16:30] That's exactly how God described
[1:16:33] Jonah to Nineveh.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; But the surprising thing is
[1:16:41] Jonas took Jonah took from his affair
[1:16:46] and pay the ticket
[1:16:49] to run away
[1:16:52] from the presence of the Lord. Amen.
[1:16:55] Amen.
[1:16:58] went into the boat.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Now, open parenthesis. A boat
[1:17:09] that I'm preaching by the grace of God.
[1:17:14] A boat represents a family.
[1:17:18] It represents a church.
[1:17:22] It represents um affairs.
[1:17:26] It represents a job or business.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; And you will notice
[1:17:36] it was only men of businessmen.
[1:17:41] Meaning there was families that was
[1:17:43] there. Amen. Amen.
[1:17:47] Now when Jonah enter into the boat,
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; there were temp there was storm. Amen.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; There was storms in the boat.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; When Jonah enter into your life,
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; THERE will be storms that will come.
[1:18:08] There the storms of misunderstanding.
[1:18:17] There will be a storm of loss in your
[1:18:20] merchandises.
[1:18:23] It will play WITH YOUR HEALTH.
[1:18:26] WHY? BECAUSE there's a storm.
[1:18:30] AND what caused the storm?
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; The presence of Jonah in your life.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; And you notice that
[1:18:38] Jonah had hidden.
[1:18:41] And when the people noticed that there
[1:18:43] was a storm,
[1:18:45] everyone started to pray upon their God.
[1:18:49] Everyone started taking conference WITH
[1:18:51] THEIR GOD.
[1:18:52] TO START EXAMINING THEIR LIFE.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; JONAH,
[1:18:59] was carefree WAS CALM,
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; HE hid himself in a corner.
[1:19:10] But because the people were in a
[1:19:12] conference with God,
[1:19:17] the pastor was looking UPON HIS SHEEP.
[1:19:22] HE WENT AND FOUND JONAH
[1:19:26] WHO WAS HIDING IN THE CORNER WHO WAS
[1:19:29] ISOLATED.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; You will see Jonah
[1:19:34] and you bring Jonah into your family.
[1:19:38] But when you notice IN A FAMILY,
[1:19:42] SOMEONE THAT'S ALWAYS ISOLATED,
[1:19:44] YOU DON'T KNOW what type what type of
[1:19:46] affairs that they're doing
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; or YOU'RE IN A FAMILY
[1:19:52] OR IN A RELATIONSHIP.
[1:19:54] IF SOMEONE IS ALWAYS RETRACTING
[1:19:56] THEMSELVES,
[1:19:58] maybe you're married, for example,
[1:20:02] and then you'll see, YOU'LL SEE YOUR
[1:20:04] partner
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; with the with THEIR PHONE.
[1:20:08] ALWAYS WITH THEIR EARBUDS.
[1:20:11] BUT what do you NOT WANT
[1:20:14] FOR YOUR WIFE TO LISTEN?
[1:20:17] What conversation
[1:20:21] there are? ARE YOU HAVING
[1:20:24] TO KNOW OTHER THAT
[1:20:26] WHY? Because there's A
[1:20:29] ENTERED SOMEWHERE
[1:20:31] PEOPLE HAD noticed Jonah. That's right.
[1:20:37] all the way to the prophet till to the
[1:20:39] shipmaster
[1:20:41] discovered Jonah.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Our pilot this EVENING IS THE LORD.
[1:20:48] DOESN'T MATTER what situation they are
[1:20:49] IN THE FAMILY. HE WILL HE will uncover
[1:20:53] it. Amen. Amen.
[1:20:56] Because he wants peace for his people.
[1:21:00] Because there was A JONAH THAT WAS
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; WHO IS JONAH?
[1:21:05] He's the open door of curse.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; He's the one who was supposed to bring
[1:21:11] the THE
[1:21:13] IN THE BEHALF OF GOD
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; to bring on the orders of God.
[1:21:21] But you'll find Jonah
[1:21:24] perverting the WORD OF GOD
[1:21:27] TO twist the word of God
[1:21:31] to change it into
[1:21:34] into something wrong.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Into something wrong. Amen. Amen.
[1:21:41] That was Jonah.
[1:21:43] You notice in the life in this manner,
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; we'll speak a little bit about
[1:21:52] something in Isaiah.
[1:21:55] Isaiah chapter one
[1:22:03] Isaiah chapter 1 verse 18.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; Listen to what the Lord says here.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; It says, "Come now and let us reason
[1:22:18] together.
[1:22:20] says the Lord,
[1:22:22] for your
[1:22:24] scarlet,
[1:22:28] they shall be as white as snow.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; Though they be red like crimson,
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; they shall be like woe. Amen.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Here the Lord is
[1:22:44] a conference saying
[1:22:46] come.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; And let us reason.
[1:22:50] Come and let us reason no matter your
[1:22:53] come before the Lord
[1:22:56] there and he will find the solution.
[1:22:58] Amen.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:01] of the prophet Jonah
[1:23:03] that it was a open door
[1:23:07] in the business
[1:23:10] in a door of curse in
[1:23:14] a door of curse in the family.
[1:23:19] Jonah enter into the boat
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; paying his affair.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; A lot of people that enter into our life
[1:23:31] It's by a code.
[1:23:34] It's us that are giving them a code for
[1:23:36] them to enter
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; or they may enter into your family
[1:23:42] to destroy you
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; or to cause a
[1:23:47] to cause a disaster in your life.
[1:23:54] When Jonah enter into your life
[1:23:57] or into your relationship,
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; he will he will look for a isolated
[1:24:04] corner.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; You need to pay close attention.
[1:24:11] When someone is retracting the self
[1:24:14] when you're in a family, amen.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:19] When you're a couple
[1:24:22] must pay close attention
[1:24:25] know that Jonah is somewhere else.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; Jonah can retract himself from his own
[1:24:36] house
[1:24:38] to do whatsoever
[1:24:41] to do things in secret. Amen. Amen.
[1:24:47] Because when it happens, when you notice
[1:24:49] it,
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; he will bring betrayal.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Jonah, the servant of God,
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; who became the the door of curses,
[1:25:03] the door of curses for the family.
[1:25:11] A lot of men of God became a door of
[1:25:13] curse for the church, for the family.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Last week in my house, I received a
[1:25:24] couple.
[1:25:26] I was with my wife
[1:25:28] and they had to buy a little bit of
[1:25:30] something
[1:25:32] and we were speaking to them about the
[1:25:33] word of God.
[1:25:41] They said it been a long time that
[1:25:42] they've been here. It's been about 13
[1:25:44] years that they've been here. But
[1:25:47] why are you not going
[1:25:52] the time of the church?
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; I'm denying the time of the church
[1:26:00] misinterpreted it.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; You misunderstood it.
[1:26:06] You don't need to go attach yourself to
[1:26:08] a church.
[1:26:12] Your your journey is to GO ALL THE WAY.
[1:26:15] WHEN YOU ENTER INTO the church,
[1:26:17] you're listening to the word of God.
[1:26:21] Don't limit yourself to have a
[1:26:23] relationship with God.
[1:26:26] Don't limit yourself TO BE SEEN BY
[1:26:29] YOUR WORKS. So you MAY BE SEEN BY GOD.
[1:26:34] YOU must be vaccinated.
[1:26:38] People are falling left AND RIGHT
[1:26:41] BECAUSE they had NOT RECEIVED THE DOSE.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; THE DOSE OF HEAVEN.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE not vaccinated.
[1:26:50] That's why they're falling.
[1:26:53] They're limiting THEMSELVES IN THE
[1:26:56] INSTEAD of doing a journey all the way
[1:26:57] to Christ
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; who is the truth and the life and the
[1:27:02] way.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:06] talking to sad and then
[1:27:10] I was saying
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; they live to the uh service of our
[1:27:16] pastor
[1:27:18] and they were shocked.
[1:27:21] Why? Because
[1:27:24] they may have a situation.
[1:27:27] They may pass their problem to a
[1:27:29] brother, to a sister, to a pastor
[1:27:33] or to whosoever,
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; to officer IN THE CHURCH.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; AND THAT person would TAKE
[1:27:41] WOULD TAKE
[1:27:44] to communicate it to someone else,
[1:27:48] someone that cannot bring a solution.
[1:27:51] Someone who can even pray for that
[1:27:52] person.
[1:27:54] So now when the person
[1:27:57] they they
[1:28:00] run away from the church
[1:28:03] and they cast themselves from the
[1:28:04] church.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Why? Because they heard
[1:28:10] that day that they trust the public to a
[1:28:12] man of God
[1:28:14] and after they go find it, they go hear
[1:28:16] it else. Amen.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Now in the sense
[1:28:25] A lot of men of God
[1:28:29] have spurs for the people of God
[1:28:33] because they have their parents of holy
[1:28:44] Others
[1:28:49] even have the audacity to target
[1:28:56] a lot of couragees and zeal
[1:28:59] to do sin to do sin
[1:29:03] using the word of God
[1:29:06] like Satan in the garden of Eden.
[1:29:11] Sound himself
[1:29:14] In the churches that are dead,
[1:29:17] they are not manifest in the power of
[1:29:19] God. That's right.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; You will notice a deacon
[1:29:27] like me and my wife were watching
[1:29:31] who was married
[1:29:33] with a wife
[1:29:36] and they did five years without
[1:29:37] children.
[1:29:39] Now this deacon
[1:29:46] And this deacon became a newly
[1:29:49] Christian.
[1:29:54] this this um this deacon pregnant a
[1:29:57] newly Christian um
[1:30:03] and that she was telling
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; she was telling this woman that you're
[1:30:09] my friend
[1:30:11] that
[1:30:13] I was never your friend but
[1:30:18] we start thinking that in church that's
[1:30:19] where we're really the true brothers and
[1:30:22] sisters
[1:30:25] This woman says, "I'm in need of a house
[1:30:29] and that your husband may go.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; What am I going to do?"
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Now, you will notice this type of deal.
[1:30:38] You're protected by THE PASTOR.
[1:30:41] AND IN CHURCHES LIKE THAT,
[1:30:43] there's no power of the HOLY GHOST
[1:30:45] THAT'S
[1:30:47] EVEN detect the evil
[1:30:50] detect the sin.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; May God help us.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; May God help us.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Here. Join us. The servant of God
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; had accumulated evil
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; in the business of businessmen.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:20] He attracted evil.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; And when they found Jonah,
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; what did they say?
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; They asked him, "What do you want us to
[1:31:33] do after?"
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; So this storm can be calm.
[1:31:39] HE SAID, "TOSS me in the WATER IN THE
[1:31:41] SEA."
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; LIKE, LIKE ALL
[1:31:46] the Jonah in your life,
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; YOU must cast HIM TO THE SEA.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; IF YOU HAVE,
[1:31:54] IF YOU HAVE PITY FOR THEM, THAT'S
[1:31:57] IT. Doesn't matter the time that he TOOK
[1:32:01] the Jonah and toss HIM IN THE SEA.
[1:32:05] THE JOINER THAT'S BRINGING YOU
[1:32:08] THAT'S BRINGING YOU PROBLEMS, you must
[1:32:09] toss them. Amen. Amen.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Because when you'll notice those
[1:32:15] businessmen,
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; they toss AWAY THEIR MERCY.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; THEY toss away THEIR JOY.
[1:32:23] They toss away their
[1:32:26] their
[1:32:28] trust.
[1:32:31] WE WERE TAUGHT Their hopes were tied
[1:32:37] because of Jonah. Amen.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; That's why they started to have
[1:32:44] God.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; They started having to everyone started
[1:32:50] praying to God
[1:32:52] and the shipmaster
[1:32:56] discovered Jonah is
[1:33:00] but you had to call out to God.
[1:33:03] Maybe he will remember
[1:33:06] he will have pity for us
[1:33:12] what we will do with you.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; And they saw
[1:33:18] upon Jonah,
[1:33:23] where do you come from? Who are you?
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; And he says, I AM A HEBREW SACRIFIC. I
[1:33:30] AM A HIGH PRIEST.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; I AM A PROPHET.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; I AM A DEACON.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; I am an evangelist.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; That's why they asked for HIS IDENTITY.
[1:33:42] NOW what do you want us to do with you?
[1:33:46] Say cast me into the sea
[1:33:49] in our family.
[1:33:51] There are wrongs THAT COME, EVIL.
[1:33:54] IF YOU DON'T PRAY,
[1:33:58] Jonah will not be discovered.
[1:34:02] AND WHEN HE'S NOT DISCOVERED,
[1:34:04] IT'S DEATH.
[1:34:06] IT'S DEATH THAT WILL ENTER
[1:34:09] death that will ENTER INTO THE FAMILY.
[1:34:11] WHY? BECAUSE JONAH is hidden.
[1:34:16] Conference with God,
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; God will intercede
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; to detect Jonah. Amen.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; We read something in Exodus chapter 14.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; We read something.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; Exodus chapter 14. I'll start in verse
[1:34:46] 13.
[1:34:50] And Moses said unto the people, "Fear ye
[1:34:53] not, stand still
[1:34:57] and see the salvation of the Lord,
[1:35:03] which he will show
[1:35:06] this evening that are listening this
[1:35:07] evening.
[1:35:11] For the Egyptian that you
[1:35:14] have seen today,
[1:35:17] no more forever.

[1:36:15] Prophet We'll read the prophet
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; a little bit. We continue.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; But you must remember like we're in
[1:36:30] John.
[1:36:34] If Jonah had already entered into your
[1:36:36] life
[1:36:39] like they did in a boat,
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; we'll take him and toss him in the sea.
[1:36:45] Amen. Amen.
[1:36:49] We'll take him and toss him in the sea.
[1:36:55] Issue to this businessman.
[1:37:00] Maybe he toss away the
[1:37:03] projects of PEOPLE IN THE
[1:37:06] FINANCE of people.
[1:37:10] When those people were tossing,
[1:37:12] IT WAS THEIR FIN.
[1:37:14] IT WAS THEIR HOPE.
[1:37:18] It was their life
[1:37:20] into the water because of that
[1:37:23] and
[1:37:25] all of that. But
[1:37:27] I GIVE YOU POWER
[1:37:30] TO WALK UPON
[1:37:32] UPON SNAKES,
[1:37:34] all type of powers of
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; and nothing will do. Amen.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Nothing will harm you.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; And we'll use that power this evening.
[1:38:04] We'll start from the message the
[1:38:06] conference
[1:38:12] of 63. Three
[1:38:21] city.
[1:38:24] Uh, the conference
[1:38:27] 1963 0608
[1:38:30] paragraph
[1:38:32] 193
[1:38:37] 107
[1:38:39] 197
[1:38:44] Okay.
[1:38:55] There Moses was given authority.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; He went down there and did miracles.
[1:39:14] And here they are right in the line of
[1:39:17] duty. And there's the
[1:39:20] Moses called a conference.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; God must have selected a place over
[1:39:27] behind the rock.
[1:39:32] Moses goes over there and says, "Lord,
[1:39:42] paragraph 197. If you walk, if you're
[1:39:44] walking in the line of duty
[1:39:47] like us this evening
[1:39:52] mandate by the to stand here
[1:39:57] in the exercise of
[1:40:00] I am calling a conference
[1:40:06] that's why we came. That's why we've
[1:40:08] come to pray for.
[1:40:12] That's why we're sent to the hospital.
[1:40:17] That's why we go to the sick bed for
[1:40:25] call a conference.
[1:40:31] Oh my, I feel religious right now. Call
[1:40:34] conference.
[1:40:38] That's what the Pentecost people need
[1:40:40] today
[1:40:42] IS CALL A CONFIDENCE. WHAT'S THE MATTER
[1:40:46] UP? There's a wedge in the there's a
[1:40:50] wedge in the
[1:40:54] conference.
[1:40:58] MOSES CALLED THE CONFERENCE SAID, "LORD,
[1:41:07] I've did just as you told me."
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; And when where we just get from read
[1:41:16] reading, you've noticed this book about
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; uh something that's forbidden.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:30] It's like they found Jonah in the boat.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; He was a dog person that could not be
[1:41:41] among businessmen.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; But here the prophet speaks about the um
[1:41:55] the forbidden
[1:41:58] When God forbid to touch something,
[1:42:02] you need to observe his law.
[1:42:06] When someone touches the forbidden,
[1:42:11] that is what the forbidden is.
[1:42:15] And that's what brings.
[1:42:17] That's what brings trials, storms into
[1:42:19] the congregation. That brings death.
[1:42:21] Amen.
[1:42:26] Now Moses had called for a conference.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Jump a little because of time.
[1:42:40] Moses called the conference
[1:42:43] said, "Lord,
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; and here we're death is coming,
[1:42:55] moving upon us
[1:42:59] like a patient with
[1:43:02] death is moving
[1:43:04] and Moses
[1:43:08] and Moses stood there till they had
[1:43:13] stayed there until God spoke.
[1:43:16] He knowed his voice.
[1:43:19] He was the prophet,
[1:43:22] meaning me and you
[1:43:25] were also capable.
[1:43:28] Moses when he saw that things weren't
[1:43:30] working out
[1:43:33] for a conference with God,
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; he didn't HE DIDN'T UM
[1:43:40] HE DIDN'T MOVE until he obtained the
[1:43:42] solution
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; for that problem.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; He didn't retract himself.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:53] But here today
[1:43:56] 199
[1:44:01] I GIVE YOU AUTHORITY.
[1:44:03] TAKE THOSE PEOPLE.
[1:44:05] GOD gave you AUTHORITY
[1:44:09] POISON TO SOMETHING GOOD.
[1:44:12] GOD GAVE YOU AUTHORITY
[1:44:14] TO REFUSE SICKNESS.
[1:44:16] GOD GIVE YOU AUTHORITY
[1:44:19] TO CREATE A WAY WHEN THERE'S
[1:44:22] GOD GIVE YOU AUTHORITY
[1:44:24] TO CHANGE.
[1:44:26] GOD GIVE YOU THE
[1:44:28] CHANGE ALL THE SITUATION. WHY ARE YOU
[1:44:31] CRYING? WHY ARE YOU CRYING?
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; You need a call.
[1:44:38] You need to CALL FOR VIOLENCE.
[1:44:41] You're lacking.
[1:44:45] Amen.
[1:44:47] He was the one who ordained
[1:44:50] the mandate for fish to bring
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; to bring money so they can pay their
[1:44:55] debt. He's capable this evening. He's
[1:44:58] the same this evening. He can do
[1:45:01] something.
[1:45:03] It doesn't matter whatsoever, whatsoever
[1:45:05] the situation, he's cap, he's capable
[1:45:08] this evening.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; Only if you could believe.
[1:45:15] Only if you could believe
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; now this evening
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; I'm bringing you so you can have
[1:45:31] conference with God
[1:45:36] in the book of Genesis.
[1:45:40] Genesis chapter 3
[1:45:44] that was when God did his first
[1:45:46] conference.
[1:45:49] It was God alone who called for that
[1:45:50] conference.
[1:45:53] What purpose did God call that
[1:45:54] conference
[1:45:56] to save his children?
[1:45:59] He gave an order. He said don't touch
[1:46:02] this. Don't do this.
[1:46:05] When you do this,
[1:46:07] you shall die.
[1:46:10] But because he was jealous of HIS OWN,
[1:46:14] HE WAS JEALOUS OF HIS OF HIS
[1:46:17] MASTERPIECE, THE THE MAN HE CREATED.
[1:46:20] HE'S JEALOUS OF YOU WHO
[1:46:22] GOD IS JEALOUS OF
[1:46:25] he descending to the into the
[1:46:29] unto the trees
[1:46:32] and had conference with his children.
[1:46:35] That's why he has slain them
[1:46:38] and he gave them as a covering
[1:46:40] and he saved them. Amen.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; That shows us THAT EVERY SINGLE TIME
[1:46:47] when we have a problem, we need to have
[1:46:50] a conference
[1:46:52] like we read in Isaiah
[1:46:54] chapter one.
[1:46:57] God has said,
[1:46:59] "Let us
[1:47:02] THE ONE WHO'S CALLING THIS CONFERENCE.
[1:47:05] He said even if your sin
[1:47:10] is there to render it
[1:47:13] only if you would
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; recognize your faults.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:24] Just keep on talking about the first
[1:47:26] conference.
[1:47:29] We were in second
[1:47:32] with God
[1:47:33] December the 20th
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; paragraph.
[1:47:44] Then I can call in my memory another
[1:47:46] conference of running prophet that had
[1:47:52] decision.
[1:47:55] is talking about Moses and he thought
[1:47:57] that pray and he had run away
[1:48:02] and married him
[1:48:04] and got back into the wilderness
[1:48:07] and been there FOR 40 YEARS
[1:48:10] PROPHET ANOINTED
[1:48:12] GREAT commission
[1:48:16] in the world a PROPHET
[1:48:20] but yet at the very
[1:48:22] of his mistake
[1:48:25] he had
[1:48:27] take it in his own hands
[1:48:32] in his in his own hands.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; Instead of following the instruction,
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; he killed a man
[1:48:41] and the threat of the fear.
[1:48:44] He ran he run into the wilderness
[1:48:50] and there was 40 years
[1:48:56] And the and the slaves of Egypt,
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; the test was so great.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Their backs were so sore.
[1:49:08] Their hearts were so broken
[1:49:12] until their cry.
[1:49:15] So he was forced to to a conflict.
[1:49:20] There was a way TO PROVOKE A CONFLICT.
[1:49:24] There's a way of forcing a conference.
[1:49:26] You can do it in your life. The showdown
[1:49:28] the prophet is telling you that it's in
[1:49:30] you that you also can do it.
[1:49:34] You can also have a conference. You can
[1:49:37] have a you can have a conference with
[1:49:39] God.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter your situation.
[1:49:44] The burden
[1:49:46] and the cries was so
[1:49:49] had to be forced to come. It cost
[1:49:52] When God makes a decision,
[1:49:55] it's got to be that way.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; So he had already
[1:50:00] before the foundation of the world
[1:50:03] had po's
[1:50:06] book of life
[1:50:10] for the perm
[1:50:15] people.
[1:50:20] All things was pre-planned by God. That
[1:50:23] man said to Moses, his servant.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, jump certain things.
[1:50:38] Moses was chosen to deliver his people.
[1:50:42] And Moses had failed God.
[1:50:47] lost confidence and courage.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; The prophet is saying,
[1:50:52] "You think you failed?"
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; Well, Moses also had failed.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; He who had
[1:51:01] the time of intimate with God, but he
[1:51:04] failed.
[1:51:07] He saw the miracles operate.
[1:51:10] God operating miracles.
[1:51:13] But he failed God.
[1:51:16] But he did. He wasn't tired
[1:51:20] to give you also courage.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; So come have conference with God.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; We who have found
[1:51:33] who have hope
[1:51:36] as a church
[1:51:39] people
[1:51:43] call a conference.
[1:51:46] it over with.
[1:51:48] See what he'll
[1:51:50] see what decision will der will derive
[1:51:54] at.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; I'll jump a little.
[1:52:05] God has sent Moses
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; because he heard the cries of his
[1:52:10] people.
[1:52:14] In paragraph,
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; in paragraph 76, Moses had his words
[1:52:25] back with God.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; He was a man
[1:52:30] like you and I.
[1:52:33] when you're in a class
[1:52:36] if YOU CANNOT DO ANYTHING
[1:52:38] BUT RETURN TO THE altar tell him
[1:52:43] what can I do in this situation I'm in
[1:52:45] FRONT OF A SITUATION
[1:52:47] WHAT CAN I DO WHAT CAN I say and he will
[1:52:51] orientate
[1:52:54] this ask the question
[1:52:56] who am I
[1:52:59] WHAT'S WHAT
[1:53:01] ARE THE EVIDENCE
[1:53:03] Just like you CAN ASK ME, I am a
[1:53:06] Christian.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; Do I have the Holy Ghost? Who is that?
[1:53:11] DO YOU HAVE THE EVIDENCE?
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; NO. IT'S A PROMISE THAT IS FOR YOU TO
[1:53:17] YOUR CHILDREN
[1:53:19] and
[1:53:21] that and many are called
[1:53:25] and Moses,
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; he was a man,
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; he said,
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; but who am I?
[1:53:32] I can't talk
[1:53:35] in this conference
[1:53:37] Moses
[1:53:39] the mouth of men
[1:53:43] to talk
[1:53:46] to come.
[1:53:48] You who are
[1:53:51] this is God.
[1:53:53] It doesn't matter.
[1:53:56] It doesn't matter if you're a member of
[1:53:57] God
[1:53:59] WHOEVER IS
[1:54:04] IF YOU'RE NEAR HIM, TOUCH HIM SPEAK AND
[1:54:07] HE WILL SPEAK.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; HE WILL LISTEN
[1:54:11] because when you say
[1:54:14] the name OF JESUS CHRIST,
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; he will listen. HE WILL
[1:54:19] THIS
[1:54:22] MAKES THE DEATH.
[1:54:24] ONE TIME JOHN WAS IN PRISON.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; The one who represented Christ.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; HE REPRESENTED CHRIST. CHRIST TO THE
[1:54:34] people
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; that he was the people. HE WAS THE
[1:54:38] PERSON.
[1:54:39] BUT JOHN BAPTIST IS in prison. HE WAS
[1:54:42] PRAYING.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; HE WAS IN DISTRESS. He was praying.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; He was discouraged. Amen.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; Because he said,
[1:54:55] The evidence of prayer
[1:54:58] is the result.
[1:55:00] Just pray, pray, pray. And there's no
[1:55:02] resolve. He took his disciples.
[1:55:06] He sent them to Jesus.
[1:55:09] He said, "Go ask."
[1:55:11] Is he the one that we must wait for or
[1:55:15] is it someone else?
[1:55:18] Someone else. Why? Because he was the
[1:55:20] he could not see the fruit.
[1:55:23] and listen.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said,
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; "Go tell them."
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; The the blind see,
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; the deaf hear,
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; the dumb are listening,
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; the the um paralyzed are walking.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; Those that limp are walking.
[1:55:51] the sick of
[1:55:53] the good news is being ministered. Amen.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; The disciples returned.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; And John Baptist understood that
[1:56:08] the same thing with you or with me.
[1:56:12] If there's no evidence in your prayer,
[1:56:15] there must be evidence.
[1:56:18] There must be fruits. There must be
[1:56:20] fruits.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; And here
[1:56:25] it doesn't matter.
[1:56:27] It doesn't matter who
[1:56:32] Christ gives you the authority. Amen.
[1:56:36] It doesn't matter the degree of
[1:56:38] I give you the authority. It doesn't
[1:56:41] matter the degree of the situation. I
[1:56:43] give YOU AUTHORITY.
[1:56:45] DOESN'T MATTER THE DEGREE OF THE
[1:56:46] SITUATION. I GIVE YOU THE POWER.
[1:56:51] It doesn't MATTER THE DEGREE OF POVERTY.
[1:56:53] I GIVE YOU THE POWER.
[1:56:55] IT DOESN'T MATTER THE DEGREE OF I GIVE
[1:56:57] YOU THE POWER.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; It's Jesus who I said.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; May God be praised.
[1:57:04] May God be praised.
[1:57:16] And Moses still
[1:57:19] see God's glory.
[1:57:21] And he said, "Moses, if you want to know
[1:57:23] who I am,
[1:57:25] I am a miracle
[1:57:28] from God."
[1:57:30] Throw your stick down on the ground and
[1:57:33] you turn into a serpent. He said,
[1:57:37] "Take your hand in your body and pull it
[1:57:39] out."
[1:57:41] And he was lepous
[1:57:46] out. It was healed.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; He was It was healed.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; You know who I am.
[1:57:53] You know who I am.
[1:57:56] I am the God
[1:57:58] that performs miracles.
[1:58:01] I AM THE GOD THAT HEALS THE SICK AND THE
[1:58:05] AFFLICTED.
[1:58:07] I am Jehovah God. Moses said,
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; "I SEE YOUR GLORY one more thing. I want
[1:58:15] to know before this
[1:58:19] is closed,
[1:58:21] will I tell
[1:58:23] that sent me?" He said
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; tell him
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; that I am.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; NOT I WILL TODAY.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; It's today.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; I am
[1:58:36] I WILL BE
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; BUT always
[1:58:41] the same yesterday and forever.
[1:58:44] I am.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; I am

[1:58:53] Now it takes future
[1:58:58] past tense.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; I am has sent you.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:04] Lord,
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; may God be praised
[1:59:14] jump a lot of things.
[1:59:29] paragraph.
[1:59:32] He says, "List
[1:59:36] 29.
[1:59:44] I I want you to notice something over
[1:59:46] here.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; It's very
[1:59:52] Moses had ordained to take
[1:59:58] to take the hands and put in the um the
[2:00:01] blood of the lamb
[2:00:05] to redeem this one in the in the door.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; The blood evidentially represented
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; the blood of Christ.
[2:00:21] the was a common weed.
[2:00:25] You could find it anywhere.
[2:00:28] Pick it up. Just pick up
[2:00:32] that blood so simple to apply
[2:00:36] to protect faith.
[2:00:45] GOD IS SAYING FOR FORMULA JUST JUST
[2:00:49] faith
[2:00:51] just take faith only if you could
[2:00:53] believe
[2:00:56] apply the blood in your heart

[2:01:05] it to your heart
[2:01:07] amen Amen.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; I'll jump a little.
[2:01:25] were on their march after being
[2:01:27] separated and called out and they came
[2:01:32] across the Red Sea
[2:01:34] and they had
[2:01:37] they couldn't cross
[2:01:40] Joshua had
[2:01:42] sound a trumpet to stop quit marching
[2:01:48] there's an obstacle before us
[2:01:51] I'm jumping
[2:01:56] about Joshua in the march
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; during the march
[2:02:03] like you a Christian
[2:02:06] they're coming every day to
[2:02:08] your you're
[2:02:11] missing this
[2:02:13] you see something
[2:02:16] the great general
[2:02:18] when he saw obstacle he said stop
[2:02:23] and the process is when you stop.
[2:02:26] That's when the
[2:02:29] problems begin.
[2:02:31] Never stop.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, I did this. Oh, I HAVE FAILED. THE
[2:02:37] PROPHET SAID, "DON'T STOP. LOOK, look in
[2:02:41] front of you. Keep moving.
[2:02:44] MAKE A CONFERENCE. PRONOUNCE THE WORD
[2:02:47] AND CONTINUE TO MARCH. DON'T STOP.
[2:03:04] OKAY. Paragraph 81 where spirit
[2:03:08] Christian soldiers sold knowing the
[2:03:10] strateg
[2:03:18] when they saw the
[2:03:20] the distance from their margin.
[2:03:24] There was the Red Sea
[2:03:26] perhaps two or three.
[2:03:29] There was a high mountain. They could
[2:03:32] there would be like there would be like
[2:03:34] sheep scattered a target
[2:03:38] and behind them before stop come the
[2:03:41] enemy
[2:03:43] is
[2:03:45] friends.
[2:03:46] the march today
[2:03:49] towards the promised land. The enemy is
[2:03:52] just a or two behind you. WE CAN'T STOP
[2:03:56] at this revival.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "Don't stop."
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:05] We can't stop at this revival.
[2:04:10] Yesterday you had the sensation. You you
[2:04:13] spoke in tongue and you stopped there.
[2:04:17] You have to keep moving forward.
[2:04:22] Paul,
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; just keep moving.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; Go on.
[2:04:31] Presence of the Holy Spirit with you
[2:04:34] that night before last night.
[2:04:38] Now continually move on into that. Don't
[2:04:41] call.
[2:04:44] Don't call no hope for the enemy is
[2:04:45] close behind you.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; Well, John,
[2:04:56] very good things. What can we do?
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:05:23] He was
[2:05:28] I don't know if
[2:05:33] someone present here is sick. Amen.
[2:05:44] is probably like one of you who's
[2:05:45] suffering from cancer
[2:05:51] like our brother here in the wheelchair.
[2:05:53] Like maybe you sitting there with cancer
[2:05:55] or with a heart trouble.
[2:06:10] or something that you know you're just
[2:06:12] going to die right now.
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; The enemy has stopped you.
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; He brought you to a halt.
[2:06:27] Maybe you come to a halt before the
[2:06:29] enemy cause you to halt.
[2:06:36] Maybe there's something in your life
[2:06:40] that caused you to halt.
[2:06:45] Whatever it is,
[2:06:49] you still have the privilege to have a
[2:06:51] conflict. Maybe you did something. Maybe
[2:06:54] you're reproaching something and because
[2:06:56] of what you've done,
[2:06:59] you cannot you can no longer comprehend.
[2:07:01] You can't pray because of this course,
[2:07:03] because of the thing that you've done.
[2:07:06] The prophet is telling you, you still
[2:07:09] have a privilege
[2:07:11] conference.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; You have a conference with your father.
[2:07:16] Let's find
[2:07:19] something about no matter what the enemy
[2:07:22] is.
[2:07:25] He's never too great for our God.
[2:07:28] We need a constant So Moses went up
[2:07:32] behind a certain place
[2:07:36] and held a conference with God. He
[2:07:38] didn't know what to do. You don't know
[2:07:41] what to do.
[2:07:44] Maybe you're a sinner.
[2:07:47] You've done so much.
[2:07:52] Maybe you smoke
[2:07:54] so you can't smoke more.
[2:08:07] and can't quit it
[2:08:10] and you can't stop.
[2:08:12] Maybe you've drank
[2:08:17] till you can't drink no more
[2:08:20] and you can't drink.
[2:08:23] You have come to a place
[2:08:26] where you're so full of sin
[2:08:30] and lost.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; So you had to look upon every woman you
[2:08:35] see wrong.
[2:08:41] Every woman you see wrong
[2:08:46] OR MAYBE YOU'VE EVEN OWN natural
[2:08:50] resources.
[2:08:52] Maybe you've come
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; to a block.
[2:09:00] I don't care where you are.
[2:09:03] God is still ready to come to you in a
[2:09:06] conflict and talk it over with you.
[2:09:12] Maybe you broke your home.
[2:09:16] Maybe you've left your husband
[2:09:19] or your wife.
[2:09:22] Maybe you run off from
[2:09:27] there. There might be things in this
[2:09:29] life the enemy has tried you into.
[2:09:36] But remember my brother, my sister,
[2:09:39] you still have the right. You have a
[2:09:42] conference with God.
[2:09:45] Yes, sir. Talk over with
[2:09:50] time of trouble.
[2:09:52] Then we see
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; perhaps this
[2:10:03] great leader of Israel.
[2:10:06] I have done all this
[2:10:09] at your command.
[2:10:11] I have led
[2:10:13] just as you have told me to do.
[2:10:16] I have called people by the blood.
[2:10:20] brought them down
[2:10:22] of the plagues.
[2:10:26] I've done everything that you've told me
[2:10:28] to do.
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; And he was trapped.
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; What must I do, Lord?
[2:10:38] This conference with you.
[2:10:49] Let's
[2:10:59] take probably this paragraph.
[2:11:11] See the problem of the church today.
[2:11:14] Paragraph 101.
[2:11:17] That's what's the matter with the church
[2:11:19] today.
[2:11:21] And he wants to give you gift after gift
[2:11:24] organization and grace after gift. But
[2:11:27] you organize yourself again
[2:11:31] because the church won't see there's
[2:11:36] there's no
[2:11:38] God
[2:11:40] for denomination.
[2:11:43] There's no
[2:11:45] any certain
[2:11:49] the
[2:11:50] go forward God's word
[2:11:54] just keep on going keep moving. God says
[2:11:57] it's right.
[2:12:00] If God says,
[2:12:02] "You've got your permission." If they
[2:12:04] say, "Well, I went to my church and they
[2:12:07] told me
[2:12:09] to have to that church
[2:12:13] now about whether I should have the Holy
[2:12:16] Ghost or not." The promise is yours
[2:12:21] to you and to your children. Amen.
[2:12:25] Amen.
[2:12:27] Honestly, we must close.
[2:12:32] must come down because of time.
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; God be praised.
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter the situation.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; God is capable this evening.
[2:12:58] If you bring him, call him to a
[2:12:59] conference.
[2:13:02] If you call him to a conference,
[2:13:05] he will be there
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; to answer you. He will be there.
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; He will be there.
[2:13:14] It takes that you might be
[2:13:17] that you might be trapped
[2:13:20] without a way out. The enemy is behind
[2:13:23] you
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; and the rest see before you.
[2:13:28] had mountains in both sides.
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; It's exactly.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; That's where Israel was also. Amen.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; Before the Red Sea,
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; it's probably where you are.
[2:13:43] It's probably where you find yourself
[2:13:45] blocked by sickness.
[2:13:49] Broken by sinitized
[2:13:52] by the situation that are impossible and
[2:13:55] discouraged.
[2:13:57] But there exist a way
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; to force God
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; TO INTERVENE
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; NOT BY FORCE
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; BUT BY A CONFERENCE. AMEN.
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; By a conference
[2:14:12] when you feel powerless
[2:14:15] in all domain
[2:14:17] in all aspect OF YOUR LIFE. WHEN THE
[2:14:20] ENEMY has locked
[2:14:23] and all the doors resembles to be
[2:14:24] closed.
[2:14:26] There's only one thing left to do this
[2:14:28] evening
[2:14:30] and it is to call a conflict. Speak to
[2:14:33] the altar.
[2:14:36] Oh, you're tired. I don't know the
[2:14:37] situation. Maybe the children are sick.
[2:14:40] Remember the family is sick.
[2:14:44] The merchandise is not working. Maybe
[2:14:46] the circumstance is not working.
[2:14:50] Remind you one thing.
[2:14:53] Peter had fished all night.
[2:14:57] He didn't catch any fish.
[2:15:00] But in the word of the Lord,
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; FISHES CAME IN THE SAND. GOD is
[2:15:09] fish in the net of Peter
[2:15:13] sand.
[2:15:15] He's capable to send money into your
[2:15:17] business. He's capable.
[2:15:21] It doesn't matter your
[2:15:24] matter your situation
[2:15:26] capable deceiver
[2:15:29] is coming
[2:15:33] the man of God is coming forward.
[2:15:37] Stand up.
[2:15:39] Stand up
[2:15:41] or in your heart
[2:15:43] or you may lift up your hand.
[2:15:46] So it may signal your prayer before God.
[2:15:50] You are in need of a conference.
[2:15:53] In need of a conference with him
[2:15:56] while the man of God is coming.
[2:15:59] No matter your situation.
[2:16:02] The commission has been given.
[2:16:05] The commission has been given.
[2:16:08] And that these are the signs
[2:16:11] that will accompany
[2:16:14] those that believe.
[2:16:17] They will pray for the sick
[2:16:20] and the sick shall heal.
[2:16:23] No matter the degree of situation, no
[2:16:25] matter the degree of the situation,
[2:16:29] we don't know exactly what Jonah went
[2:16:31] through in the bedroom.
[2:16:34] We don't know who is Jonah in your life.
[2:16:37] Maybe you are the Jonah,
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; but there is a way out.
[2:16:44] &gt;&gt; God spoke
[2:16:47] that affliction shall not the second
[2:16:50] time. No matter what
[2:16:52] may be deception,
[2:16:55] maybe you had a relationship
[2:16:58] and then everything didn't work out.
[2:17:01] Remember, affliction shall not rise.
[2:17:04] All you have to do
[2:17:06] is call for a conference with God.
[2:17:11] When Adam sinned,
[2:17:13] God himself came and he had a
[2:17:16] conference.
[2:17:18] When the people of God when they were
[2:17:20] trapped in Egypt,
[2:17:22] God called for a conference, Moses had a
[2:17:25] conference with God in Gethsemane.
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; GOD HIMSELF,
[2:17:31] BROTHER, BROTHER OF GOD THAT GOD himself
[2:17:34] had a conference
[2:17:36] and the comfort
[2:17:38] and God
[2:17:40] and
[2:17:42] DELIVERANCE CAME.
[2:17:44] NO MATTER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, the
[2:17:46] situation you're going through,
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; no matter the situation tonight,
[2:17:58] we are calling for comfort with our God.
[2:18:02] Lord God,
[2:18:04] we are lifting up our hand and this hand
[2:18:08] is representing our presence before your
[2:18:11] presence.
[2:18:12] You know that in your presence
[2:18:16] sick people are healed.
[2:18:18] If somebody's dead,
[2:18:22] no matter which part is life will come
[2:18:26] because every time YOU DIE FROM THE
[2:18:28] DEAD, life always coming because you
[2:18:31] have because you are the resurrection.
[2:18:35] every part of the body that was dead
[2:18:37] quickly.

[2:18:42] going to look at THE SITUATION OF YOUR
[2:18:46] CHILDREN.

[2:18:50] school,
[2:18:52] those that ARE IN OUR FAMILIES,

[2:19:01] speaking
[2:19:04] difficulties. difficulty,
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; those that have difficulty.

[2:24:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:33] &gt;&gt; This is not the word of a man.

[2:24:37] Polycarp.
[2:24:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:39] &gt;&gt; It is written in the Bible.
[2:24:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:24:41] &gt;&gt; How many times did you read the Bible
[2:24:44] &gt;&gt; and you never pay attention to that
[2:24:46] statement
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; until it's read tonight.
[2:24:49] &gt;&gt; Many of you read Jonah.
[2:24:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; Many of you have read the prophet Naom.
[2:24:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. But how many remember that it was
[2:24:57] spoken that affliction would not come.

[2:25:15] deep fast.
[2:25:16] &gt;&gt; It's a deep sleep. Amen.
[2:25:18] &gt;&gt; And you notice people that cause trouble

[2:25:41] &gt;&gt; He seems like he's not even caring.
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; If he doesn't come to church, he's fine.
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; If he miss a meeting, that's fine.
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; If he doesn't pray, that's fine. He's
[2:25:51] more comfortable
[2:25:53] &gt;&gt; than those that around.
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; Those that around are seeking for
[2:25:57] solution.
[2:25:58] &gt;&gt; But the one who caused the problem is
[2:25:59] usually the one who doesn't even seek
[2:26:01] for solution.
[2:26:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:08] &gt;&gt; You know, I was thinking today about our
[2:26:11] friendship,
[2:26:12] &gt;&gt; our associate.
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; Who do we associate with?
[2:26:18] &gt;&gt; Who hang around with you?
[2:26:21] Who's your body?
[2:26:23] &gt;&gt; And tonight God is bringing Jonah.
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; I was thinking about it. Amen.
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; You see people deviating, people backs
[2:26:34] leading. Watch carefully. Watch who's
[2:26:36] around.
[2:26:37] &gt;&gt; Watch who's connected to that person.
[2:26:41] &gt;&gt; Either they have a worldly friend
[2:26:44] &gt;&gt; that begin to pull on them.
[2:26:46] &gt;&gt; They have a friend that is taking them
[2:26:47] to sport. or they have a so-called
[2:26:50] message believer friend that does not
[2:26:53] live the life correctly
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; because when I say the world many will
[2:26:58] rise up. Let me leave the world.
[2:27:00] &gt;&gt; Let me go in the message.
[2:27:02] &gt;&gt; Let me go in the message.
[2:27:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Your child is misbehaving all the
[2:27:09] time.
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; Push the brake. Watch who is hanging
[2:27:12] with your child.
[2:27:15] &gt;&gt; Uh we will get into this. Amen.
[2:27:19] &gt;&gt; We will get into this time is already
[2:27:21] gone. We will get into this. But you
[2:27:22] need to be careful who you hang out
[2:27:24] with.
[2:27:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:27:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:29] &gt;&gt; You can get yourself in big trouble in
[2:27:32] this message.
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; When I'm saying this, you having a hard
[2:27:35] time to understand.
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown, I'm saying get among
[2:27:39] preachers.
[2:27:42] &gt;&gt; H Now, now I shock you with that one
[2:27:44] &gt;&gt; because you didn't believe that one. Do
[2:27:46] you need a quote for that one? He said
[2:27:48] get among a bunch of preacher.
[2:27:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Brand I'm saying and you get in
[2:27:52] trouble.
[2:27:53] &gt;&gt; If if if among a bunch of preacher there
[2:27:56] is trouble, what do you think?
[2:27:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; Sit down and examine who hang out with
[2:28:05] you.
[2:28:06] &gt;&gt; What is their spiritual life?
[2:28:08] &gt;&gt; That's it. That's it.
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; How is their life?
[2:28:11] &gt;&gt; A man that is already complicated.
[2:28:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; A sister complicated. Everything don't
[2:28:17] work in your life. Everything is
[2:28:19] blockage. And this is the person you
[2:28:21] hang out with
[2:28:23] &gt;&gt; to be the savior.
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; Let's leave it alone, my friend. Amen.
[2:28:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:28:33] &gt;&gt; If something your boat is rocking left
[2:28:36] and right, rocking left and right, storm
[2:28:39] after storm, you need to push the brake
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; and begin and get the light and begin to
[2:28:46] shine all over your house to see where
[2:28:49] is the problem coming from. Is it myself
[2:28:53] who's causing the problem
[2:28:55] &gt;&gt; or is it somebody in the family or
[2:28:57] somebody in my surrendering
[2:29:00] &gt;&gt; that has been the author of all the
[2:29:03] trouble that I'm going through?
[2:29:05] &gt;&gt; Because as long as Jonah is not taken
[2:29:08] care of, you're going to lose the the
[2:29:10] the where
[2:29:13] &gt;&gt; all the merchandise
[2:29:14] &gt;&gt; that was in the boat was in the sea.
[2:29:17] Everything that you took to go make
[2:29:19] business in the sea.
[2:29:21] You begin to lose after one thing after
[2:29:24] the other trying to lighten up the boat.
[2:29:27] &gt;&gt; The problem was not to lighten up the
[2:29:29] boat. There was only one solution to
[2:29:31] lighten up the boat. If they would have
[2:29:33] pick up Jonah quickly, everything else,
[2:29:36] the merchandise could have been saved.
[2:29:38] But the longer we take, the more we keep
[2:29:40] losing. The longer we take, the more we
[2:29:43] keep losing. The longer I know what I'm
[2:29:45] saying is strong, but I don't have any
[2:29:47] choices. Amen. It's impossible for you
[2:29:50] to be way up here and suddenly boom. No,
[2:29:53] no, no, no, no. Something is wrong in
[2:29:55] your life. If you want to pro to
[2:29:57] progress in your life, seek really true,
[2:30:00] good Christian, solid people.
[2:30:04] &gt;&gt; People that would tell you the truth.
[2:30:06] &gt;&gt; People that would not compromise with
[2:30:08] you.
[2:30:09] &gt;&gt; People that would look at you in the
[2:30:11] face and say, "Brother, dare you were
[2:30:13] wrong."
[2:30:14] &gt;&gt; People that would tell you, "Brother,
[2:30:15] this is time to go to church. We need to
[2:30:17] quit." Amen.
[2:30:18] &gt;&gt; People that would tell you, "Hey, I
[2:30:20] didn't see you in church. We need to go
[2:30:21] to church. Where were you at?"
[2:30:24] &gt;&gt; People that would tell you, "Listen, my
[2:30:25] friend, this is church time. I'm going
[2:30:28] to church."
[2:30:29] &gt;&gt; People that would tell you, "The pastor
[2:30:30] spoke six months about this meeting. I
[2:30:33] am not going to miss. IF YOU STAY, I'M
[2:30:35] GOING TO BE THERE." THESE ARE THE people
[2:30:37] that you hang out with.
[2:30:40] &gt;&gt; Not people that are pulling you back.
[2:30:43] &gt;&gt; SINCE YOU GOT THAT FRIENDSHIP, now you
[2:30:45] drop in your spiritual life. You need to
[2:30:48] push the brake and come out quickly.
[2:30:52] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me.
[2:30:53] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me.
[2:30:55] &gt;&gt; You didn't understand me.
[2:30:57] &gt;&gt; Watch who you trying to associate.
[2:31:00] &gt;&gt; Watch who you trying to hook.
[2:31:04] &gt;&gt; Watch who you are hooking with.
[2:31:06] &gt;&gt; Your new discovery that you love
[2:31:10] &gt;&gt; that is keeping you on the telephone all
[2:31:12] the time. that is keeping you busy with
[2:31:15] others people life
[2:31:17] &gt;&gt; and never talk about the message of the
[2:31:19] hour
[2:31:22] &gt;&gt; take Jonah put them in water
[2:31:25] &gt;&gt; ah God will take of the God will take
[2:31:27] care of them in the water put them in
[2:31:29] the water
[2:31:32] &gt;&gt; you didn't get me God will take care of
[2:31:34] them in the water they will have the
[2:31:37] conference in the belly of A WELL
[2:31:40] &gt;&gt; BUT AS LONG AS YOU HANG OUT YOU GOING TO
[2:31:42] BE IN TROUBLE OH,
[2:31:47] &gt;&gt; you I I I don't I I don't know if you
[2:31:50] understand what I'm saying.
[2:31:52] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you understand what I'm
[2:31:53] saying. You a married woman. Your friend
[2:31:55] are divorced.
[2:31:58] &gt;&gt; What? What? What is What do you think
[2:32:00] you're going to do?
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:32:03] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? Are we
[2:32:06] together? You're a married woman and
[2:32:08] you're going through marital problem.
[2:32:11] surrender yourself with people that are
[2:32:13] strong in marriage.
[2:32:14] &gt;&gt; So, YOU BEGIN TO SUCK ANOTHER ENERGY.
[2:32:18] &gt;&gt; You begin to suck a different anointing
[2:32:20] that will push you through and move on.
[2:32:23] Not some Have you ever seen somebody who
[2:32:26] is uh who went through a problem? They
[2:32:29] will usually hang out with a person who
[2:32:31] went through the same problem and they
[2:32:33] think they helping each other. No, they
[2:32:35] have been like uh crabs.
[2:32:40] Are we together?
[2:32:42] &gt;&gt; No. They are condoning, they are
[2:32:44] comforting one another in that level. So
[2:32:46] whenever you call, it's about the same
[2:32:49] conversation. Ah, you know how people
[2:32:51] are. We don't we don't believe anyone.
[2:32:54] We don't believe church people. I was
[2:32:56] disappointed. And this one say yes. I
[2:32:58] was disappointed. No, God cannot live
[2:33:01] without a witness. We got to find a true
[2:33:04] Christian, a true believer, somebody
[2:33:07] that reflect the word.
[2:33:09] &gt;&gt; Look at who you are associating with.
[2:33:13] &gt;&gt; Young sister, look at who you are
[2:33:15] associating with.
[2:33:17] &gt;&gt; Young brother, look at who you are
[2:33:18] associating with.
[2:33:20] &gt;&gt; Married people, look at who you are
[2:33:23] associated with.
[2:33:24] &gt;&gt; Look at which couple are you hanging
[2:33:26] around with.
[2:33:28] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Look at the one that is
[2:33:31] positive, THAT IS FULL OF ENERGY.
[2:33:34] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY THAT SISTER, PRAISE A LOT, I
[2:33:36] NEED TO LEARN ABOUT THAT SISTER. I NEED
[2:33:38] TO BE CONNECTED to that sister.
[2:33:40] &gt;&gt; I must, you must come in my life to
[2:33:42] bring ME UP.
[2:33:44] &gt;&gt; NOT COME IN MY LIFE TO BRING ME DOWN.
[2:33:47] &gt;&gt; IF SOMEBODY OH,
[2:33:51] &gt;&gt; you don't understand what I'm saying.
[2:33:53] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:33:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:33:56] &gt;&gt; Surrender yourself with people that are
[2:33:58] strong. You say that a pastor, I will
[2:34:01] call the pastor. I will ask the pastor
[2:34:03] question because when I talk to him, he
[2:34:05] talked to me about God. He talked to me
[2:34:07] about this one. I'm going to call
[2:34:09] brother so and so. Because every time
[2:34:10] you sit with him, when you come out from
[2:34:12] his presence, it feels like you are
[2:34:14] charged. You were talking about this. I
[2:34:17] learned something I didn't know. Those
[2:34:19] are the people that you surrender with.
[2:34:22] The hour is late.
[2:34:24] &gt;&gt; He's my friend. Especially young sister.
[2:34:28] is my friend. We need to show love.
[2:34:31] &gt;&gt; You need to show love.
[2:34:33] &gt;&gt; How many times have you shown love
[2:34:36] &gt;&gt; with your love? Your love. Your love. We
[2:34:38] need to show support.
[2:34:40] &gt;&gt; If they struggling, BRING THEM TO THE
[2:34:42] PASTOR.
[2:34:44] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me well. If they
[2:34:46] struggling, bring them to the deacon.
[2:34:51] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:34:52] &gt;&gt; There was a young man, now he's married
[2:34:54] with children. He was hanging around
[2:34:57] with someone. I say, "What are you doing
[2:35:00] with that woman?" Oh, no. We are uh I
[2:35:04] mean witnessing to the woman and
[2:35:06] everything. I say, "How long are you
[2:35:08] going to witness to the woman?"
[2:35:11] &gt;&gt; Because you keep hanging around this
[2:35:12] woman.
[2:35:13] &gt;&gt; If you already told them you are going
[2:35:15] to church and they know the church, take
[2:35:17] the woman and turn her to the deacon
[2:35:20] &gt;&gt; and let the deacon hang off. I mean take
[2:35:22] over because you are struggling. He
[2:35:24] ended up sleeping with the woman. See
[2:35:27] there. See there.
[2:35:28] &gt;&gt; And now it was a problem OF PRAYING TO
[2:35:31] PULL HIM OUT FROM THE WOMAN.
[2:35:32] &gt;&gt; Trying to do things that you don't even
[2:35:35] know what you're trying to do. If
[2:35:37] somebody is struggling, hey, your love,
[2:35:40] your sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love.
[2:35:41] Forget it. Call the deacon. You say,
[2:35:43] "Please, please see the deacon. Please
[2:35:46] see somebody that we can pray for you
[2:35:48] and get this thing out of it."
[2:35:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. This message is not psychology.
[2:35:55] No,
[2:35:56] &gt;&gt; this is not a psychology to be
[2:35:57] comforting the people. We need to show
[2:35:59] support. Everybody left him. No, SHE GOT
[2:36:02] A PASTOR. GO TALK TO YOUR PASTOR.
[2:36:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:36:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:36:08] &gt;&gt; You cannot carry your own burden. How
[2:36:09] are you going to carry 20 people's
[2:36:11] burden? You are young and before you
[2:36:13] know it, ah a lot of stuff are going
[2:36:15] because you carrying stuff that are not
[2:36:16] yours. YOU TOO YOUNG. FOCUS ON YOUR
[2:36:19] LIFE.
[2:36:20] &gt;&gt; PRAY FOR THE SISTER. FOCUS ON YOUR LIFE.
[2:36:25] ARE we together?
[2:36:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together? BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY,
[2:36:28] "SHOW ME WHO YOU HANG OUT WITH.
[2:36:31] &gt;&gt; I will tell you who you are."
[2:36:35] &gt;&gt; Bird of the same water.
[2:36:38] &gt;&gt; They flock. How
[2:36:40] &gt;&gt; you are spiritual like this? Your friend
[2:36:42] is low.
[2:36:44] &gt;&gt; And you want me to believe you
[2:36:45] spiritual? Both of you are together.
[2:36:51] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together?
[2:36:54] &gt;&gt; Examine your life. See what's going on.
[2:36:57] If you are Jonah, my friend, call for a
[2:37:00] conference and get everything out before
[2:37:03] you causing disaster to the family.
[2:37:05] &gt;&gt; If somebody is a Jonah, say, "My friend,
[2:37:08] I see that we've been friend for a long
[2:37:10] time. But I believe the problem that
[2:37:12] you're going through, you need a
[2:37:13] spiritual leader to go handle this
[2:37:15] problem."
[2:37:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. You are not qualified to have a
[2:37:19] doctorate degree and give prescription.
[2:37:22] &gt;&gt; So quit giving your prescriptions.
[2:37:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:37:28] &gt;&gt; I even have sister blocking another
[2:37:30] sister from going to the pastor.
[2:37:33] &gt;&gt; Don't bring your stuff to the pastor. I
[2:37:35] say no problem. Whatever happened to
[2:37:37] that sister, you will pay for it
[2:37:39] &gt;&gt; because you are the psychologist of the
[2:37:42] message. Where sister will call you to
[2:37:44] tell you what is wrong.
[2:37:46] You are not there. When a sister come
[2:37:48] and begin yeah you say
[2:37:52] you see brother Steven he can talk with
[2:37:54] you four hours me I will pray for you
[2:37:58] but go see brother Steven over there. Go
[2:37:59] see the deacon over there. Amen. Amen.
[2:38:03] Because when they go God provided way
[2:38:05] God is under obligation
[2:38:08] &gt;&gt; to s to to come and surrender. Amen.
[2:38:11] Amen. Make your job easy in this life.
[2:38:14] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:38:16] Yes sir.
[2:38:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. You are not built for it. Don't
[2:38:19] touch it.
[2:38:19] &gt;&gt; Don't touch it.
[2:38:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. A complain a complain. You say you
[2:38:23] see those type of complaint you start
[2:38:25] here. It can cause problem in the
[2:38:27] church.
[2:38:28] &gt;&gt; So before we go forward and tomorrow
[2:38:30] brother Stephen call me. Did you hear?
[2:38:32] You go deal with that person and call
[2:38:34] the deacon and you pull back and you
[2:38:37] start praying
[2:38:38] &gt;&gt; before you find yourself in the middle
[2:38:40] of a mess that you don't know what
[2:38:43] you're doing. And that mess cause you
[2:38:44] problem when you were climbing up
[2:38:46] spiritually on Tuesday you pray on
[2:38:49] Tuesday you pray on Tuesday you pray you
[2:38:51] begin to clam with the Lord and suddenly
[2:38:53] a Jonah
[2:38:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:59] &gt;&gt; Call on for a conference. Examine your
[2:39:01] life well. Check your family. Check what
[2:39:04] is going on. Quit your how you are
[2:39:07] spiritual. Whatever. Put it down. You
[2:39:09] say, "Hey, this situation has been going
[2:39:11] on for a long time. We don't see any
[2:39:13] problem here getting resolved." What is
[2:39:15] the problem?
[2:39:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:21] &gt;&gt; All right. Uh, somebody want to go home.
[2:39:24] Let's stop here.
[2:39:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm just helping you summarize
[2:39:30] everything and putting together so you
[2:39:32] understand what the Holy Spirit want to
[2:39:34] tell you because God cannot speak like
[2:39:37] this and affliction come back again.
[2:39:39] Affliction must now rise up again the
[2:39:42] second time. Whatever you going through
[2:39:44] will be one shot and you come out of it
[2:39:46] and you go. Amen. But remember,
[2:39:49] surrender yourself
[2:39:51] &gt;&gt; with people that are spiritual
[2:39:53] &gt;&gt; people that can help you in life,
[2:39:55] &gt;&gt; not negative energy under the name of
[2:39:58] the message.
[2:40:00] &gt;&gt; I don't care how bad they are. I don't
[2:40:02] care how they are. I don't care how much
[2:40:04] message they look outside. If what they
[2:40:07] producing is not true, just know you're
[2:40:10] going to work twice to try to build them
[2:40:12] to your position. And if you try, then
[2:40:15] they cannot come to your level. You will
[2:40:17] be the one dragging down because they
[2:40:20] will suck all your energy. Every time
[2:40:22] you leave them, you have to repent.
[2:40:24] After you stop the communication with
[2:40:26] them, you must ask forgiveness because
[2:40:28] you murder yourself in the things that
[2:40:30] were not yours.
[2:40:32] Cast that Jonah into the water. Amen.
[2:40:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, and those that are
[2:40:39] online and those that miss tonight and
[2:40:41] those that will listen to this,
[2:40:44] get Jonah out in the water. Let Jonah go
[2:40:48] back to Nineveh to preach the gospel
[2:40:51] over there

[2:42:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42:38] &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[2:42:41] are approaching you humbly tonight.
[2:42:43] Father, thanking you for your grace,
[2:42:45] your love, your mercy, and for
[2:42:47] everything you have been doing for us.
[2:42:50] Father, thank you for speaking to us all
[2:42:53] tonight, Lord, and pointing unto us
[2:42:56] things that we need to do in our life,
[2:42:58] things that we need to get rid of that
[2:43:01] are causing us problem in our lives.
[2:43:04] Father, Lord, your prophet stated that
[2:43:07] no one knows what is in the mind save
[2:43:10] the spirit which is in the mind. And
[2:43:13] when you sent your word, your word will
[2:43:15] always come to bring healing and it
[2:43:17] would never return unto the void.
[2:43:20] Father, I don't know who, but I believe
[2:43:23] all of us somehow one way of the other
[2:43:27] we going through some affliction. Maybe
[2:43:29] somebody is troubling us. Maybe an
[2:43:32] affliction in finances, maybe an
[2:43:34] affliction in marriages, maybe an
[2:43:36] affliction at work, maybe an argument,
[2:43:39] maybe a situation, a sickness or
[2:43:42] whatever it is. But your word stated
[2:43:44] that that affliction shall not rise
[2:43:46] again, rise up again the second time.
[2:43:49] Lord, I pray that the Holy Spirit again
[2:43:52] anoint this word and interpret them in
[2:43:54] our life because the only one that can
[2:43:57] interpret and bring things to come is
[2:43:59] the Holy Spirit Lord. Father, may you
[2:44:02] interpret this in the life of your
[2:44:04] children both visible and invisible
[2:44:06] audience so that Lord Father your
[2:44:08] children can be delivered and what seems
[2:44:11] to be Lord Father a trial today can turn
[2:44:14] to a testimony that never we will go
[2:44:17] back that road Lord. Father, I didn't
[2:44:20] see a time when David was Lord attacked
[2:44:23] by the bear the second time. It was one
[2:44:26] time and he used it as a testimony.
[2:44:28] Father, Lord Jesus Christ, I pray that
[2:44:30] whichever battle and suffering and
[2:44:32] affliction your children are going
[2:44:34] through, Lord, as you send your word,
[2:44:37] may you give us grace so that this will
[2:44:39] be the one time we are going through.
[2:44:42] May nobody fail the test, but may we
[2:44:44] come out victorious so that it will be
[2:44:47] classified as a testimony and never to
[2:44:50] be visited again. Lord, we are
[2:44:52] committing the remaining of the weak
[2:44:54] unto their hand. Lord, may your blood
[2:44:56] continue to protect us. May you give us
[2:44:59] travel mercy. May you protect this
[2:45:01] property and everything that is within.
[2:45:04] May you take the ongoing work unto the
[2:45:06] hand and may you strengthen your servant
[2:45:08] that you use tonight. We commit it all
[2:45:10] and humbly ask it father in the name of
[2:45:14] Jesus Christ.
[2:45:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:16] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.

[2:45:27] me,
