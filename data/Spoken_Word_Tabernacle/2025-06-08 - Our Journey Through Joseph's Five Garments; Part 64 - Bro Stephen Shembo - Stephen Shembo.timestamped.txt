[0:00] God will hear you. He always hears a
[0:02] desperate soul. That's what I'm trying
[0:03] to tell you about. Hallelujah. Our dear
[0:06] Lord, Jesus himself in the world's
[0:10] greatest
[0:11] battleground,
[0:13] Gethsemane, he cried out in
[0:17] despair. Should he take the sins of the
[0:20] world or should he just remain on earth
[0:24] with his beloved disciples what he
[0:26] wanted to do? But watch his humility as
[0:29] he humbled himself. Not my will but
[0:32] thine be done. Humbled himself to the
[0:35] word, the promised word of the God of
[0:37] heaven. Notice then he went a little
[0:40] further. And if he went a little
[0:42] further, how much more ought we to go a
[0:45] little farther? See, and notice the
[0:47] scripture says here in Luke that he
[0:50] prayed earnestly.
[0:53] Brother and
[0:54] sister, if Jesus had to pray earnestly,
[0:57] how much more have we got to pray
[0:59] earnestly?
[1:02] If Christ the God of heaven made flesh
[1:07] had to pray earnestly, then how much
[1:09] more are we sinners saved by grace? Pray
[1:12] earnestly.
[1:16] If if the
[1:19] decision throw the son of God into
[1:22] despair,
[1:26] [Music]
[3:48] Heat. Heat.
[3:58] [Music]
[4:41] We stand.
[4:44] Y'all help me out. Something just hit my
[4:47] throat. On
[4:50] holy ground.
[4:54] Hallelujah.
[4:57] And I
[5:00] know that
[5:02] there are
[5:06] angels all around.

[5:24] Jesus now

[5:35] in his presence.

[7:10] Lord is
[7:12] near and
[7:14] where he
[7:17] is is holy.

[47:15] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. There are little

[48:17] again to Spoken Word Tabernacle. We
[48:19] believe everybody is good and I believe
[48:22] you are all up to date with the sermon
[48:25] and we are reading our Bible twice a
[48:27] day. Our cood book church ages 70 weeks
[48:30] of Daniel the seals adoption or somebody
[48:34] is listening to the message of the hour.
[48:38] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[48:41] Whatever we do in our life we mind the
[48:46] message of the hour. Amen.
[48:50] Ask the young uh young brother, brother
[48:53] Joshua can tell you very well. Amen.
[48:56] We had a wonderful young man's meeting
[48:58] yesterday and we started in courtship
[49:02] and brother Paul, brother Joe, that was
[49:04] the first time brother Paul now
[49:07] graduated to be part of the young man
[49:09] and he started with
[49:13] courtship. But I told him he's young
[49:16] enough to even get engaged into
[49:19] courtship because yesterday we gave them
[49:22] the five crucial point of God with men
[49:26] before giving him a wife.
[49:29] Five crucial point. They all know what
[49:31] it is. There are five crucial point God
[49:35] have with a man before he give him a
[49:38] wife.
[49:40] If I break it down, we won't preach
[49:42] anything.
[49:46] Amen. Five of them. And I went one, two,
[49:50] three, four, five. And I ask a question.
[49:53] How many people are ready for courtship?
[49:56] Nobody.
[50:00] It's it's there. The deacon were there.
[50:03] It's recorded. I asked them a question.
[50:05] I say, "Okay, these are the five point,
[50:08] five criteria
[50:10] God have before he give you a wife."
[50:12] I say who is ready for courtship? No
[50:15] one.
[50:18] I said before I talk to you about how
[50:20] which family you have to look at and the
[50:23] woman is let leave all of that. Let's
[50:26] deal with man.
[50:29] What is a man? And before God even think
[50:33] of man being alone, what are the five
[50:36] criteria God have? They all know about
[50:39] it. you ready for courtship? None of
[50:43] them.
[50:46] So they were loaded and I told them you
[50:48] go ahead sit down and ponder and
[50:51] meditate on
[50:52] this. Brother Paul, meditate on
[50:55] this and then when it's soaking in
[50:58] pretty good courtship sheep part two
[51:01] then we continue. Amen. This is
[51:04] different than young sister. This is
[51:06] something you don't have any clue about
[51:08] it. This is only for boys. Yes sir. For
[51:11] men because they the patriarch. They the
[51:14] one that will start family. They are the
[51:16] one initiating the courtship.
[51:18] Five things that a man should have. And
[51:22] they are
[51:24] lacking because we didn't have
[51:26] this. We only survive
[51:31] by the grace of God.
[51:33] Some of some of our marriages we just
[51:37] rammed on each other maybe at the
[51:39] nightclub
[51:42] and then we got married and the grace of
[51:44] God was so strong
[51:47] until we stand together and then we
[51:49] became Christian then we gave our life
[51:52] to the Lord and we begin to understand
[51:55] what marriages are but that won't be the
[51:57] case for you
[52:01] no father can be a drunker and then
[52:05] converted and want his children to go to
[52:07] the same path. Amen. We're not preaching
[52:09] you so you go back again and suffer the
[52:12] things that we suffer before we get
[52:15] married. You have all the choices before
[52:19] you to begin right and to enjoy your
[52:22] life until we meet you into the air.
[52:26] Amen. Amen. If you want to learn the
[52:28] hard way, be my guest. I told them, "I
[52:31] will still be your pastor. You will be
[52:33] calling me all the time. And I'm going
[52:35] to remind you the young men meeting. I
[52:38] say, do you remember what I was telling
[52:39] you? This is exactly what you're going
[52:41] through." Amen. Because one error is
[52:44] going to be fixed on the other side.
[52:47] Hello. You didn't get me? Can you give
[52:50] me some volume? One error is going to be
[52:53] fixed on the other side because a bad
[52:56] woman won't die quickly.
[53:02] You can put all life insurance on her.
[53:05] She won't die quickly.
[53:08] God will make sure you pay for it
[53:11] because you didn't listen to the
[53:13] warning.
[53:15] Are we together? So parent, let's stick
[53:18] with the message of the hour.
[53:21] If you have any question, see the
[53:23] deacon. They can give you what we spoke
[53:25] about. Amen.
[53:27] So we see you brother who organized it
[53:30] brother Enoch or brother Joshua because
[53:32] you you order now uh compared to the
[53:35] other one please talk to brother Enoch
[53:37] and the deacon and tell me when is part
[53:39] two so we continue to sore even if he
[53:41] take part 10 I would take part 10
[53:43] because you are boys amen and I don't
[53:47] play with boys
[53:50] because one thing wrong we will be all
[53:52] suffering the whole family will suffer.
[53:55] Are we together? Amen. All right. How
[53:57] many people read the message I send in
[53:59] the church group? Shot. Two messages.
[54:03] Praise God. If you didn't read it, I
[54:05] will hold you
[54:06] accountable of the message. Amen.
[54:10] Everybody's clear. We establish the
[54:13] legacy in this church. And our legacy is
[54:16] on the word of God. What the Bible says,
[54:20] and what the message of the hour says.
[54:22] Amen. Outside of that, there is nothing
[54:25] else that I will comply with you. Any
[54:28] question? Any question? No, sir. So,
[54:31] make sure parent, let's stick together
[54:34] with the word of the hour. Young people,
[54:37] let's stick with the word of the hour.
[54:41] Children, let's stick with the message
[54:43] of the hour. This message has no legacy
[54:46] for foolishness.
[54:50] Amen.
[54:51] Amen. Amen. until I become so nervous
[54:54] when they talk about a young people
[54:56] gathering
[54:58] because 80% of the time it's a recipe
[55:02] for disaster.
[55:05] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Can you
[55:09] say amen my brother? Amen. Ah so let's
[55:11] stick with the message of the hour.
[55:15] Amen. Amen. Musician, let's stick with
[55:18] what? The message of the hour.
[55:19] Technician, let's stick with what? The
[55:21] message of the hour. spoken word. Let's
[55:23] stick with what the message of the hour.
[55:25] If what I'm preaching here is too strong
[55:28] for you
[55:30] and you cannot stand it,
[55:33] find another pastor
[55:36] who will let you do whatever you want to
[55:38] do
[55:40] and he doesn't care about it. But as for
[55:43] me, I care for my sheep.
[55:45] As for me, I want to know what you're
[55:47] doing.
[55:48] As for me, if you in trouble, I'm going
[55:51] to be there and I'm going to watch what
[55:54] is going on. Whether you like it or not,
[55:57] I'm going to use even my force to make
[56:00] sure I save you because I love you. Love
[56:04] is disciplined.
[56:06] Love is strict and love is corrective.
[56:10] So, let's stick with the message of the
[56:12] hour. If you have a problem you don't
[56:14] understand, come and sit with me. Come,
[56:17] let's talk. If you don't understand
[56:19] something that was taught, it's online.
[56:22] Go back and review music. Go back and
[56:24] review what we talk about. Amen. Amen.
[56:27] Unless you say that I'm going off to
[56:29] another church, that's fine. But as long
[56:31] as you hear, my friend, I'm going to
[56:33] stand toeto toe with you until you get
[56:37] married.
[56:40] Are we together? Are we together? So
[56:43] wherever you going, reflect the message
[56:46] that you have been preached here.
[56:50] If I don't preach what I need to preach
[56:52] today, that's fine. Because you're not
[56:55] responding the way I'm waiting. Let's go
[56:57] to 1 Corinthian 11.
[57:05] I was trying to spare you this.
[57:10] Amen. Amen.
[57:17] A pastor is not a pastor that will let
[57:19] you do whatever you want to do. Yes,
[57:21] sir. If you got one like that, leave
[57:24] that church. Yes, sir.
[57:26] You didn't get me. Leave that church.
[57:29] That man doesn't care about your soul.
[57:32] He care about your tithing
[57:35] and your offering.
[57:38] You can go kill yourself. He's fine.
[57:44] Amen. Amen. 1 Corinthianap 11 verse 2.
[57:48] You there? Amen. Young men's understand
[57:51] this because I thought I touched with
[57:52] them this yesterday. The Bible say, "Now
[57:56] I praise you."
[57:58] You might be
[58:00] seated. Now I do what? I praise you.
[58:03] Who's praising people? Paul. Paul is
[58:05] praising them. Paul say I praise you
[58:08] brethren that you remember me in some
[58:12] things in all things.
[58:15] Paul is praising this believer. Why?
[58:19] Because this believer they remembering
[58:21] Paul when in all things. So there is
[58:24] nothing in the lives of this believer.
[58:28] That they were doing without first
[58:31] remembering Paul. Amen. This Paul here
[58:34] is not the man Paul. But is Paul the
[58:38] messenger?
[58:41] It is Paul the message.
[58:44] Because the message and the messenger
[58:47] are one at the same. In other words,
[58:50] Paul can be taken off the scene. But
[58:53] till today we are reading Paul. And this
[58:56] believer whatever they do, they always
[58:59] first remember Paul.
[59:02] Brother Stephen, everything you do, you
[59:04] want to have a quote for it because of
[59:06] this.
[59:09] Amen. You want to do this, what does
[59:12] Paul say? You want to do this? What did
[59:15] Paul say? You want to get married? What
[59:17] did Paul say? You want to travel? What
[59:19] did Paul say? You want to eat?
[59:23] What did William Bran say?
[59:26] [Applause]
[59:28] And Paul say, "I praise you. I praise
[59:30] you. Why?" Because everything you doing
[59:32] in all things you are thinking about me
[59:35] first
[59:38] because he was not Paul he was God in
[59:41] Paul
[59:43] and Paul say if I if somebody comes
[59:47] and preach something that is contrary to
[59:51] what me Paul are saying you call that
[59:53] person a curse and Paul say even if an
[59:57] angel come from heaven angel and come
[1:00:00] down and say something different than
[1:00:02] me. Call that angel a curse. That's why
[1:00:06] whatever this believer were saying or
[1:00:09] were doing, they always remember Paul.
[1:00:12] You want to receive the praises of God,
[1:00:15] remember what William Marion Pranam
[1:00:18] says. Whatever you want to do in your
[1:00:20] life, what did the message says about
[1:00:22] this?
[1:00:26] I praise you brethren that you're
[1:00:30] remembering me when in all things and do
[1:00:33] what? And keep the ordinances as I
[1:00:35] delivered them to what to you. So this
[1:00:39] believer kept the word pure
[1:00:43] repeat what brother Brham said and keep
[1:00:46] what brother Brandham said and remember
[1:00:48] what brother Brandham said because when
[1:00:50] you believe his prophet You are
[1:00:54] guaranteed to succeed.
[1:00:57] Learn that from today young people.
[1:01:01] You want you you are trying to do
[1:01:03] something. What does the message say
[1:01:04] about it? Amen.
[1:01:08] Amen. We're not just living like people
[1:01:11] who don't have uh any guidance.
[1:01:15] We are children of the light.
[1:01:18] And not any kind of light, the evening
[1:01:20] light. Amen. So the light came to shine
[1:01:23] our path. So we know how we are going
[1:01:27] and where we are going and how we need
[1:01:30] to walk.
[1:01:32] If not, you going to be ever learning
[1:01:35] and never come to the knowledge of the
[1:01:36] truth. It's a disaster. Amen. Amen.
[1:01:41] Amen. Amen. Amen. I told the young man,
[1:01:45] I say before God gave Adam, Eve, God
[1:01:51] gave the word
[1:01:53] to Adam.
[1:01:55] God didn't give the word to Eve.
[1:01:59] He gave the word to Adam and that was
[1:02:01] it. Because God knew that if the word is
[1:02:06] in Adam, Adam would take the word and
[1:02:09] give it to Eve. And if you go to Genesis
[1:02:12] 3, you will see Eve repeating the
[1:02:15] commandment that God gave to Adam when
[1:02:18] Eve was not there. Who taught Eve that?
[1:02:22] I say, young man, are you ready to teach
[1:02:24] a young woman at home, the word of God?
[1:02:28] You want to get married? Are you ready
[1:02:29] to sit with your wife and to talk to her
[1:02:32] about the mysteries of God? Are you
[1:02:35] ready? Because you don't read the
[1:02:36] message yourself. You don't listen to
[1:02:39] the tape yourself. You don't read the
[1:02:41] Bible to yourself. A leader blind trying
[1:02:44] to lead somebody.
[1:02:51] Amen. I gave them an example.
[1:02:54] Zechariah was the only one in the
[1:02:56] temple.
[1:02:58] With Gabriel, women did not get inside
[1:03:01] the temple.
[1:03:03] And Gabriel spoke to Zechariah. And
[1:03:07] Zechariah doubted and he became dumb.
[1:03:10] But he got the message. The message was
[1:03:13] you're going to have a child and his
[1:03:14] name is going to be John. Amen. When he
[1:03:17] came out, he was dumb. He was unable to
[1:03:21] display or unable to communicate
[1:03:25] the message that he receive. Do you
[1:03:27] follow me? But God already gave it to
[1:03:30] him the message. But the day John the
[1:03:33] Baptist was born,
[1:03:37] They can show you the scripture.
[1:03:39] They ask, "What is the name
[1:03:42] of the baby?" It was not Zechariah that
[1:03:46] answered.
[1:03:47] The Bible say it was Elizabeth
[1:03:50] that answer and say the name is John.
[1:03:54] Are we together? How did Elizabeth know
[1:03:58] that the name of the child is John? In
[1:04:01] other words,
[1:04:05] Zechariah, even though he was dumb, he
[1:04:08] managed to take the word, the message
[1:04:11] and to convey the message to his wife.
[1:04:15] And the Bible said they brought him
[1:04:17] something he have to write on. So he
[1:04:19] write so he wrote the message on the
[1:04:22] table to make sure his wife speak the
[1:04:26] same language. If you ask Zechariah, the
[1:04:29] name is John. You ask Elizabeth, the
[1:04:32] name is John. A husband and a wife must
[1:04:35] speak the same language.
[1:04:37] [Applause]
[1:04:42] You want to get married,
[1:04:44] you need courtship,
[1:04:46] how much of the message do you know?
[1:04:52] Are we together? Are we together? Amen.
[1:04:55] So give me the next date my friend then
[1:04:57] we can move on. But as for me and this
[1:05:01] church, this church doesn't belong to
[1:05:03] me. This church belong to the Lord Jesus
[1:05:06] Christ. I'm put here as a manager. Amen.
[1:05:10] As a steward, so I must obey the master
[1:05:15] and I must stay true to my to my
[1:05:18] position. Amen.
[1:05:25] Whatever cost come, I'm willing to take
[1:05:27] it
[1:05:29] because of this message. Because we
[1:05:31] already got separated from there. It was
[1:05:34] tough and we got used to it. So now I
[1:05:36] have zero tolerance.
[1:05:41] Are we together? Amen. I have what?
[1:05:45] I want to know where my children are
[1:05:46] going. Amen. I want to know where the
[1:05:48] young people are going. I want to know
[1:05:51] where they are. If you ask me right now,
[1:05:53] where is Charles Hamilton? I will tell
[1:05:55] you. Amen. Because he told me where he's
[1:05:57] going.
[1:05:59] If something happened, I can dispatch a
[1:06:01] deacon. Amen. I'm a shepherd.
[1:06:04] Hallelujah.
[1:06:09] Are we together? Amen. Okay. Our
[1:06:12] question and answer will be on July the
[1:06:14] 19th. Shake somebody's hand. say, "I I

[1:06:44] good stuff. everything

[1:08:00] as far as we are outside. If we have not
[1:08:03] baptized somebody, let's stay with the
[1:08:05] atmosphere of the church. Once we
[1:08:07] finish, then you can check your friend

[1:09:39] Okay. So, let's go to the reading of the
[1:09:42] word.
[1:09:46] Say it again.
[1:09:48] Go. Praise

[1:10:13] [Music]
[1:10:15] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. New in the
[1:10:19] message. She will be baptized today
[1:10:22] after service. So I'm expecting you
[1:10:25] older sister, older younger sister to be
[1:10:28] a testimony and an example for her.
[1:10:33] Amen. Amen. Oh, now let's stand for the
[1:10:36] reading of the word. Now you can turn
[1:10:38] your clock on.
[1:10:41] Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:10:49] Praise God. Amen.
[1:10:53] I apologize.
[1:10:57] I say on Wednesday, brother Brandham say
[1:10:59] something on Wednesday and then it shift
[1:11:01] me because my way of hearing God is
[1:11:04] different than your way. I'm very
[1:11:07] sensitive especially to the voice of
[1:11:09] brother Brana. And then it shifted me
[1:11:12] and then I was puzzled between two
[1:11:14] messages. I say, "Okay, should I go with
[1:11:16] the season or should I leave Hezekiah
[1:11:19] and Paul?" And I sat down. I sat down
[1:11:21] until the spirit gave me clarity. Then I
[1:11:24] settle down. I cannot skip Hezekiah.
[1:11:29] I need to go by Hezekiah and pick up
[1:11:31] Paul and then we can go. What do you do
[1:11:34] in season and out of season? And I sat
[1:11:37] down and I work work all night. I tried
[1:11:40] to put Paul and Hezekiah together. It's
[1:11:42] not working. Hezekiah, open up. Open up.
[1:11:46] Open up. Open up until there is no way I
[1:11:48] can even touch Paul. One one scratch on
[1:11:51] Paul. So we are dealing purely with
[1:11:54] Hezekiah. This could be a very difficult
[1:11:57] lesson. So pay attention and stay on
[1:12:01] board. Are we together? Amen. Decrease
[1:12:04] the moving because this could be
[1:12:05] difficult. Amen. Praise God.
[1:12:09] Amen. Amen. Praise God. I spoke to
[1:12:12] brother Malcon from Canada. God richly
[1:12:15] bless him. He greeted the church and uh
[1:12:19] he had some meeting that are going on in
[1:12:21] Canada uh with the young people. So he
[1:12:24] called me he say I just want you to know
[1:12:27] the speaker so you make sure if somebody
[1:12:29] want to come there you comfortable with
[1:12:31] those minister because he doesn't
[1:12:33] believe in young people going everywhere
[1:12:36] that's what he told me. So you want to
[1:12:37] go there you see me but he greeted the
[1:12:40] church he greeted brother Freddy he
[1:12:42] knows you very well. So, uh, just want
[1:12:45] to pass on if he's taking care of his
[1:12:47] sheep, I need to take care of mine.
[1:12:49] Amen. Because I will be answering before
[1:12:52] God because of you. Amen.
[1:12:56] So, you don't love me here. It's good. I
[1:12:59] will when we get over there. Oh my God.
[1:13:02] We will be hugging each
[1:13:05] other. We will be hugging each other
[1:13:07] without any problem because you can't
[1:13:10] get there without perfect love.
[1:13:14] Unless you stay here with a world that
[1:13:17] is in confusion when Elon and Trump are
[1:13:20] batting heads. Stay here yourself.
[1:13:24] Suit yourself.
[1:13:26] Flight attend and prepare for takeoff.
[1:13:29] Amen. Let's go to Jeremiah 29.
[1:13:36] Make America great. Make America great.
[1:13:38] Make America great. There is no great
[1:13:40] America.
[1:13:44] We have a kingdom that is coming. That
[1:13:47] is the great kingdom.
[1:13:50] Hallelujah.
[1:13:54] People want to stay here.
[1:13:56] [Music]
[1:13:57] [Laughter]
[1:14:00] My subject this morning is our life
[1:14:03] journey through Joseph 5 garment part
[1:14:07] 64. Amen.
[1:14:10] My theme today is the divine purpose.
[1:14:16] This is completely gone. But rub
[1:14:19] it, please. Divine
[1:14:26] purpose. Divine
[1:14:29] purpose. And
[1:14:33] Hezekiah's prayer.
[1:14:40] because I'm unable to touch Paul. If I
[1:14:43] touch Paul, you stay here five hours.
[1:14:46] Amen. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord,
[1:14:50] we approaching you humbly this morning.
[1:14:52] Father, we thank you for your grace,
[1:14:54] your love, your mercy, and for
[1:14:56] everything you have been doing for us.
[1:14:58] Father, this is as far as I can go with
[1:15:01] the ability you have given me when it
[1:15:03] come to speaking your word, especially
[1:15:05] this precious message. We are unable to
[1:15:08] even touch it because Lord, Father, this
[1:15:11] is so sacred that only the Holy Spirit
[1:15:14] can come and maneuver your word yourself
[1:15:17] because you are the author of this word,
[1:15:19] Lord. Father, may you move me and the
[1:15:21] audience completely out of the way. May
[1:15:23] you come and bless our soul, touch and
[1:15:25] feel us and those that are online in
[1:15:28] Jesus precious name. Amen.
[1:15:32] Jeremiah
[1:15:40] 29. You need to have your Bible.
[1:15:43] Jeremiah 29 verse 11. The Bible says,
[1:15:47] "For I know, we know who knows, right?"
[1:15:50] Amen. The thoughts that I think toward
[1:15:54] you says the
[1:15:57] Lord thoughts of peace. Now you begin to
[1:16:00] understand that and not of evil. It
[1:16:04] doesn't mean you won't go through trial.
[1:16:06] You understand this now? To give you an
[1:16:10] expected end. So the beginning good, the
[1:16:14] ending guaranteed to be good. We clear?
[1:16:18] Let's go to John chapter nine. You might
[1:16:20] be
[1:16:22] seated. John chapter
[1:16:26] 9. Glory to
[1:16:34] God. John chapter
[1:16:41] 9. I want you to keep a couple of things
[1:16:43] in mind as we are
[1:16:45] soaring. Amen.
[1:16:48] The first one these things comes from
[1:16:50] brother Brham. The first one is in the
[1:16:53] exposition of the seven church ages in
[1:16:56] sardisian
[1:16:57] churches. Brother Brham say but as
[1:17:02] usual when one regard a verse how
[1:17:06] superficially
[1:17:08] he will come up with a what? A
[1:17:09] superficial understanding. That's why
[1:17:11] brother Brandham say it's a shallow
[1:17:13] mind. Yeah. And brother Brandham say
[1:17:15] when a pope come from the United States
[1:17:18] the shallow man will go to the
[1:17:20] ecumenical council. Those that say
[1:17:22] superficially with the message and you
[1:17:25] can't catch really because the beast you
[1:17:27] need to get under the thunder to see
[1:17:30] what the devil is doing. Without the
[1:17:33] thunder the devil will go around you. It
[1:17:35] is the thunder that shows you exactly
[1:17:38] sir how the devil operate and you can
[1:17:41] block the devil and get away from it.
[1:17:43] Amen. If not, you'll find yourself
[1:17:45] swallowing something that look like
[1:17:47] Christianity,
[1:17:49] but it's purely from the devil.
[1:17:52] Are we together? Brother Brham says in
[1:17:55] the message, "This day, this scripture
[1:17:57] is fulfilled." Number two, he say
[1:18:00] history always does what? Repeats itself
[1:18:03] and scripture has a what? A compound
[1:18:06] meaning to it and a compound what?
[1:18:09] Revelation. So the Bible some a
[1:18:11] scripture can say one thing and a
[1:18:14] scripture can turn around and say
[1:18:16] another thing. Amen. That's what render
[1:18:20] this word almost unlimited
[1:18:23] because you can look at different angle
[1:18:25] but you looking at the same thing.
[1:18:28] Everybody okay? If you stand outside of
[1:18:31] this church and you look this way you
[1:18:34] are looking at the church. You will see
[1:18:37] things about this church over there.
[1:18:39] Amen. But you didn't see everything.
[1:18:41] Make sense? If you go back here, you're
[1:18:44] going to see something about this
[1:18:45] church. And if you go around the other
[1:18:47] side, you will see something. In other
[1:18:49] words, it depend on which angle you
[1:18:51] taking.
[1:18:53] Amen. We clear? Amen. So keep those two
[1:18:56] things in mind as we soaring. John
[1:18:59] chapter 9 verse uh one. If you dare, you
[1:19:03] can say amen. Amen. The Bible say, "And
[1:19:06] as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which
[1:19:10] was blind from his
[1:19:13] birth." This man was not a baby
[1:19:18] because he could talk before the
[1:19:19] Pharisee himself. This was a grown up
[1:19:22] and adult man. Amen. And but he was a
[1:19:26] man that was blind and his blindness was
[1:19:29] from his birth. Amen. What we trying to
[1:19:32] draw there is he had an illness
[1:19:39] that have been with him for a long time.
[1:19:42] Amen. Keep that in mind, my friend.
[1:19:45] Amen. He was suffering for something.
[1:19:48] Amen. Amen. For a long time.
[1:19:54] It is something that started from birth.
[1:19:57] Until the man became an adult.
[1:20:00] He was still struggling with it. Amen.
[1:20:04] And he got used to it.
[1:20:07] Amen. And he already develop how to live
[1:20:11] his daily life still carrying that
[1:20:14] illness.
[1:20:18] Until him and the illness became one.
[1:20:24] Are we together? Amen. until he was
[1:20:29] identified
[1:20:32] by the illness.
[1:20:35] So if they see him instead of calling
[1:20:37] him by his name, they will call him the
[1:20:40] blind man that sit over there. If they
[1:20:43] want to give a reference to him, they
[1:20:45] say the blind man that sit at the
[1:20:47] corner. And he also accepted that
[1:20:50] identity
[1:20:52] as a blind manise because everybody knew
[1:20:54] that he was blind. It was something that
[1:20:58] came to his life, a tragedy
[1:21:01] that happened to his health.
[1:21:04] Amen. For a long time.
[1:21:08] Are we together? Are we together? Praise
[1:21:11] God. Verse two. and his disciple asked
[1:21:15] him. So his tragedy had already
[1:21:20] theory that were coming
[1:21:23] up. Some people look at his situation
[1:21:26] for a long time and begin to try to find
[1:21:28] answer in the word.
[1:21:31] What did brother Brham says about this?
[1:21:36] And some find
[1:21:37] answers. They say according to the
[1:21:40] message of the hour,
[1:21:43] are we together? According to the
[1:21:45] message of Moses,
[1:21:48] these type of things happen when the
[1:21:51] parent sin.
[1:21:55] Are we together? Because according to
[1:21:58] the law, there are certain disease,
[1:22:02] certain plague, certain curses, that
[1:22:06] will follow the family all the way
[1:22:08] through the fourth generation.
[1:22:11] So you might be completely innocent of
[1:22:13] something, but your great great grandpa
[1:22:16] did something and because of what he
[1:22:19] did, you are receiving the whooping.
[1:22:24] Are we together? Amen. So by the word
[1:22:27] for a moment of time these people were
[1:22:30] right. Amen. Amen. Amen. We know the
[1:22:34] mystery.
[1:22:36] We know why they suffering like that.
[1:22:38] Because somebody did something in their
[1:22:40] family and they carried that into their
[1:22:43] family. That's the reason why they are
[1:22:45] suffering this. Are we clear so far?
[1:22:48] Amen. But thank God it was Jesus that
[1:22:51] saw him. Amen.
[1:22:54] Everybody saw him but could not bring a
[1:22:56] solution.
[1:22:58] But one day another man saw him. By the
[1:23:01] name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And the
[1:23:03] disciple turned to Jesus Christ. They
[1:23:05] say wait a minute this thing has been
[1:23:07] here for a long time. We all got
[1:23:10] question about this boy. So since we
[1:23:12] have access to the supreme intelligence
[1:23:16] since we have access to we have access
[1:23:19] to the prophet himself. Amen. The one
[1:23:22] who can tell you what happened
[1:23:23] yesterday, today, and forever. Let's go
[1:23:26] quickly and take opportunity and say,
[1:23:28] "Father,
[1:23:31] what's wrong with this boy right here?"
[1:23:33] Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Amen. And they begin
[1:23:36] to guide Jesus Christ
[1:23:40] in the answer already. They didn't say,
[1:23:43] "What happened to this boy?" No, they
[1:23:45] say, "What happened to this boy? Did his
[1:23:47] father sin?" So in other words they say
[1:23:50] Jesus go this way this way. We know the
[1:23:52] word is already there. You are the word
[1:23:54] follow this way.
[1:23:57] Are we together? Amen. Are we together?
[1:24:00] Amen. The Bible says in verse two and
[1:24:02] his disciple asked him saying
[1:24:06] who did sin?
[1:24:10] In other words we want to know who sin.
[1:24:17] comma this man
[1:24:21] or his what parents that he was born
[1:24:24] what blind. So if they got that
[1:24:26] information, they can tell everybody,
[1:24:28] "No, no, no. It was him that sin. The
[1:24:30] Lord spoke to us."
[1:24:33] The reason why he's going like this, it
[1:24:35] was his parent.
[1:24:38] Amen. Because they already have the
[1:24:40] word.
[1:24:42] The maker now is answering. Amen. Amen.
[1:24:45] Verse three. And Jesus answered, saying,
[1:24:48] Jesus answered, sorry, neither has this
[1:24:52] man seen. Hallelujah. the only one who
[1:24:55] can put an end to that theory
[1:25:00] because let every man's word be a lie
[1:25:04] only God's word can be the truth in
[1:25:07] other words the Supreme Court Amen is
[1:25:10] giving the verdict
[1:25:12] amen who sin not this man
[1:25:16] okay so he might be his parent now
[1:25:19] continue continue
[1:25:22] master Jesus Okay. He was near there.
[1:25:25] Neither has this man seen nor who? His
[1:25:29] parents. Ah.
[1:25:32] So, how many people seen in this
[1:25:33] neighborhood?
[1:25:38] I ask you a question. In this
[1:25:40] neighborhood, how many people sin? No.
[1:25:42] Nobody. No. No. No. No. How many people
[1:25:44] told lies? Because they were gossiping
[1:25:47] about the young man. They say he was his
[1:25:49] parent and some say he was himself. All
[1:25:52] of them were wrong. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:25:55] Amen.
[1:25:58] Amen. So, it's a problem that have
[1:26:01] nothing to do with you. Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:26:04] Amen. And it's a problem that have
[1:26:07] nothing to do with your family.
[1:26:09] Hallelujah. Yes, sir. A trouble that
[1:26:12] have nothing to do with you.
[1:26:15] Even though you spent so many times
[1:26:18] thinking you did something. Amen. You
[1:26:21] corrected this. Did you correct it? Did
[1:26:22] you correct it? It's not going.
[1:26:25] [Applause]
[1:26:28] Yes, sir. Amen. Your parent went and
[1:26:31] repented to church and sleep on the
[1:26:34] floor and cry and cry. It's not going.
[1:26:41] It has nothing to do with you. It has
[1:26:44] nothing to do with your parent. But
[1:26:46] where is the origin of this?
[1:26:49] Amen.
[1:26:51] Wow. Amen. Can I continue? Amen. Jesus
[1:26:55] said, "Neither has this man sin nor his
[1:26:58] parent,
[1:27:01] but what a mystery."
[1:27:04] That the works of God
[1:27:08] should be made what? Manifest in him. So
[1:27:12] this trouble hit this boy for a purpose.
[1:27:18] Amen.
[1:27:20] Is he too strong? No. And that purpose
[1:27:23] has nothing to do with his father.
[1:27:27] It has nothing to do with himself.
[1:27:31] It was God's purpose that open up an
[1:27:35] illness.
[1:27:36] Yes, sir.
[1:27:38] to strike the boy for a long period of
[1:27:42] time because God wanted to display.
[1:27:49] God wanted to use that boy as an example
[1:27:53] to show his power.
[1:27:56] [Applause]
[1:27:58] In other words, you going to change from
[1:27:59] a problem into a testimony.
[1:28:06] I don't know if you you understanding
[1:28:07] me. There was a time they say the woman
[1:28:11] that goes to dialysis
[1:28:13] but there came a time they said the
[1:28:15] woman that was delivered from dialysis.
[1:28:21] It is no longer dialysis but it became a
[1:28:24] testimony against dialysis. In other
[1:28:27] words, you become the word that people
[1:28:30] can use. to get blessing.
[1:28:36] [Applause]
[1:28:38] Are we together, my friend? Are we
[1:28:40] together, my friend? Are we together?
[1:28:46] Illness, suffering for a long time for a
[1:28:51] divine
[1:28:55] purpose. Ah,
[1:28:58] what a consolation. Amen. What a
[1:29:01] consolation
[1:29:03] because I suffer so much.
[1:29:07] Amen. Amen. Amen. I don't know why this
[1:29:10] came.
[1:29:13] Let's s my friend. Amen.
[1:29:16] As we are in this subject right
[1:29:19] here. We found out that under the heaven
[1:29:23] we got three element my friend.
[1:29:27] Under heaven we dealing with time. Yes,
[1:29:29] when it come to our prayer. The second
[1:29:32] one we dealing with season and the third
[1:29:35] one we are dealing with purpose and this
[1:29:39] is where we are with our purpose.
[1:29:43] Everybody clear so far? Amen. Now,
[1:29:45] brother Brham says this
[1:29:47] again. He say I ask him for something
[1:29:51] sometime and he shake his head and he
[1:29:54] says what? No. Brother Brandham say I
[1:29:57] just much I just rejoice so much about
[1:30:00] that as if I if he can as if as I can if
[1:30:06] he said yes because we always ought to
[1:30:10] ask what thy will be done you begin to
[1:30:13] understand this one in other word God we
[1:30:16] are clear with this have two answers
[1:30:20] that's why he said neither cold or hot
[1:30:23] not in the middle not lukewarm God have
[1:30:26] two answers. Either the answer is yes or
[1:30:29] either the answer is what? No. If the
[1:30:32] answer is yes, you match his will, you
[1:30:35] match his purpose. If the answer is no,
[1:30:38] you did not match his purpose.
[1:30:42] Or it's not time yet. Or it's not the
[1:30:45] season yet. Amen. And this no is better
[1:30:48] than if God would have told you yes. We
[1:30:51] clear my friend. Amen. This yes is
[1:30:54] different than this yes. That's right.
[1:30:57] Amen. Are we together? This yes is the
[1:31:01] perfect will of God.
[1:31:04] Are we together? This one is the
[1:31:07] permissive will of God. Yes sir. Yes
[1:31:10] sir.
[1:31:13] Amen. Amen. And brother Brham say when
[1:31:16] God tells you no he say if that is his
[1:31:20] will it's a whole lot better than what
[1:31:23] his yeses if it is his will to what to
[1:31:26] do it that is when you really love him.
[1:31:29] Amen. God test your love when he says
[1:31:33] no.
[1:31:35] Amen.
[1:31:37] Put your seat belt my friend.
[1:31:40] God test your love when he says no.
[1:31:44] A parent usually test the child. When
[1:31:48] the parent says no,
[1:31:52] mama, can I have this? Mama, can I have
[1:31:55] this? Mama, can I have this? This is the
[1:31:58] best mother ever. But when mama say no,
[1:32:03] this is when we need to see your
[1:32:04] reaction.
[1:32:07] Brother Steven, pastor, can I have this?
[1:32:10] Pastor, can I have this? But there will
[1:32:12] come a time pastor will say no. Show me
[1:32:15] that you love me. When I say no
[1:32:21] because our
[1:32:22] relationship have been
[1:32:24] always established by yes.
[1:32:28] Our relationship are established by
[1:32:31] approbation.
[1:32:34] Oh that's a nice man. That's a nice
[1:32:36] brother. That's a nice sister. That's a
[1:32:39] nice family. Because they always say yes
[1:32:42] to you. Because they are always there
[1:32:45] for you. But when you call and they are
[1:32:48] not there for you, this is the time you
[1:32:51] show how much you love them.
[1:32:53] [Applause]
[1:32:54] [Music]
[1:32:56] [Applause]
[1:32:59] Amen. Amen. Amen. If you stop on the
[1:33:03] street and you see a beggar, a bum and
[1:33:07] you lower your window, and you give him
[1:33:10] a $100 bill, he will tell you, "God
[1:33:13] bless you." He's not a message believer,
[1:33:16] but he knows better to tell you, "God
[1:33:18] bless you." Because he's receiving
[1:33:20] favor.
[1:33:22] But tell him that I'm not going to give
[1:33:24] you money. You will get a curse
[1:33:27] from the same man.
[1:33:30] [Applause]
[1:33:31] [Laughter]
[1:33:35] Is it too strong to handle? Our
[1:33:37] relationship should not be based on yes.
[1:33:43] Because sometime we do things against
[1:33:46] the word of God.
[1:33:49] When you do things for the word of God,
[1:33:52] we will praise you. We will clap hands
[1:33:54] for you. But when you do things contrary
[1:33:57] to the word of God, I cannot clap my
[1:33:59] hand. You need a whooping.
[1:34:03] And you should be happy with the
[1:34:05] whooping because it's love.
[1:34:10] [Applause]
[1:34:14] Say amen, my friend. Amen. Are we
[1:34:16] together? So God test your love by what?
[1:34:21] By you saying yes. By him giving you
[1:34:24] everything? No, he want to see when he
[1:34:26] blocked
[1:34:28] if you would go to church.
[1:34:33] Lord, I pray I pray I pray you don't
[1:34:35] give me this. I don't go to church. You
[1:34:37] don't love him. Though he slay me,
[1:34:42] yet I trust him. Nothing can separate me
[1:34:46] from the love of God. Amen. Whether I
[1:34:48] receive it or not, that's not my
[1:34:50] problem. Amen. But King Nebuchadnezzar,
[1:34:53] we are not going to bow down. If God
[1:34:56] deliver us, son, if he doesn't deliver
[1:34:59] us, son,
[1:35:01] that is the true love of God.
[1:35:06] Are we together? Are we together? Are we
[1:35:09] together? I asked God for something, he
[1:35:11] didn't give it to me. So and so asked
[1:35:13] for something, he gathered. I got upset.
[1:35:19] Do you love God? Yes. No, you love the
[1:35:22] material of God.
[1:35:25] You love the benefits of God. It's like
[1:35:28] a woman who love a man for money.
[1:35:32] But he doesn't really love the man.
[1:35:35] You should love the man whether he has
[1:35:38] money or not. You love the man.
[1:35:41] [Applause]
[1:35:43] Seek ye first the kingdom of God and
[1:35:46] everything else will be added unto you.
[1:35:48] Because what we are today was not
[1:35:51] revealed when we were younger.
[1:35:53] My wife didn't know I'm going to be a
[1:35:55] pastor. It revealed as time goes along.
[1:35:59] So love the man, not the possession of
[1:36:02] the man.
[1:36:06] [Applause]
[1:36:07] Are we together? Young sister, are we
[1:36:10] together? Are we together? Amen. Look at
[1:36:12] the character of a man.
[1:36:15] Look at the character of the young man.
[1:36:19] Don't look at which car he's driving.
[1:36:22] You can change car. You can go get a
[1:36:25] loan yourself. But look at the
[1:36:27] character. Character will give you
[1:36:30] everything.
[1:36:33] [Applause]
[1:36:35] Are we together? Amen. Are we together?
[1:36:38] Amen.
[1:36:40] God test your love when he says no. And
[1:36:45] God is watching
[1:36:46] you. If you really love him, this is
[1:36:49] what brother Brandham is saying. And
[1:36:51] brother Brandham continue. He say it is
[1:36:54] best to do what? Have God's will. That
[1:36:57] is what we he taught us. He taught us
[1:37:00] what thy will be done. Thy what? Kingdom
[1:37:02] come. Thy what? Will be done. We must
[1:37:05] submit.
[1:37:07] It's not a may, a must. Submit oursel to
[1:37:11] what? His will. And what? His word.
[1:37:13] Don't question it.
[1:37:18] Amen. Don't worry, my friend. Don't
[1:37:21] question it. What do you do? Believe it.
[1:37:24] Don't try to find a way around it.
[1:37:28] In other words, don't try to find a
[1:37:29] shortcut.
[1:37:31] God says this. But what about if I
[1:37:35] do? Stay where God say something because
[1:37:38] that's where safety is. Amen. Amen.
[1:37:41] Father Brandham say don't try to find a
[1:37:43] way around it. Just take it the way you
[1:37:46] want it is. So many wants to go
[1:37:49] around get some other way. And when you
[1:37:52] do, you find yourself doing what? Going
[1:37:55] on. You found God doing what? Blessing
[1:37:58] you. But you are working in his water.
[1:38:00] Permissive will and not in his perfect
[1:38:04] divine will. Will. Oh, it's working.
[1:38:07] Nothing happened to me. It's just a
[1:38:08] matter of time.
[1:38:10] [Music]
[1:38:11] It's just a matter of time before you
[1:38:14] cry. And you're going to cry for a long
[1:38:17] time.
[1:38:21] Hallelujah. Are we together? Amen.
[1:38:23] Because God purpose is supreme.
[1:38:27] Follow me my friend. The Bible say in
[1:38:29] whom also we have obtained what?
[1:38:31] Inheritance. Being predestinated
[1:38:34] according to what? The purpose of him
[1:38:36] who does what? who workketh all things
[1:38:38] after the council of his own what will
[1:38:41] because his purpose is his will. Amen.
[1:38:43] In other words, God purpose for your
[1:38:46] life will dictate your life. It will
[1:38:50] manipulate your life. Amen. It will
[1:38:53] influence your life. Amen. It will
[1:38:55] dominate your life. Amen. Whether you
[1:38:57] like it or not, God will block you
[1:39:00] everywhere until you stay in his
[1:39:02] purpose.
[1:39:04] Yes, sir.
[1:39:05] [Applause]
[1:39:08] Are we together? Are we together? Let's

[1:39:47] lost quickly. Chapter 18, verse
[1:39:51] one. If you dare, you can say, "Amen."

[1:40:03] that who? Hezekiah, the son of Ahaz,
[1:40:07] king of Judah, begin to reign. We're
[1:40:10] trying to understand who is a
[1:40:13] Hezekiah because we're dealing with
[1:40:15] Hezekiah. Before you deal with Hezekiah
[1:40:18] prayer, we need to know who is Hezekiah
[1:40:22] because some of us don't want to read
[1:40:24] the book of the kings.
[1:40:26] They always love the
[1:40:31] psalm. They are full of psalm in the
[1:40:33] head.

[1:46:23] he broke what in pieces the what? The
[1:46:26] brazen serpent, the who that Moses had
[1:46:28] made
[1:46:33] a 25 years old young man
[1:46:37] look at idolatry in the message
[1:46:41] [Applause]
[1:46:43] [Music]
[1:46:44] read it with me please if I have to
[1:46:47] preach this five sermon I don't have any
[1:46:49] problem let's go my friend he says he
[1:46:52] broke in pieces the present serpent that
[1:46:56] The greatest prophet Moses met the
[1:46:58] brother and serpent. This boy came and
[1:47:01] took the breath and serpent and destroy
[1:47:04] it and nothing happened to him. Why did
[1:47:08] he destroy it? Break it down.
[1:47:11] Do you follow me my friend? The Bible
[1:47:13] say he broke in pieces the present
[1:47:15] serpent who Moses had made. For those
[1:47:19] days, for to those days the children of
[1:47:22] Israel did burn water incense to it. And
[1:47:25] he call it And he call it what? Neustan.
[1:47:28] He who call it. No. Who call it?
[1:47:32] Hezekiah. Hezekiah call it what?
[1:47:35] Neustan. Do you know what that means? It
[1:47:37] means a thing of of bronze. In other
[1:47:41] word, when people begin to burn ence to
[1:47:43] it, Zechariah Luke, he say that's a
[1:47:46] thing. Exactly. You missed the
[1:47:48] revelation.
[1:47:50] He was not meant to be worshiped. There
[1:47:53] was a preview of Jesus Christ. This is
[1:47:56] just a thing of bronze. He took it and
[1:47:58] broke it. And brother Brandham called
[1:48:01] him a prophet.
[1:48:06] [Applause]
[1:48:10] You need a quote. See me after church.
[1:48:12] A young man who is so inclined with God,
[1:48:17] a 25 years old who knows how to detect
[1:48:20] idolatry
[1:48:22] and say we am brother, he's our brother,
[1:48:25] but he's God messenger. We don't worship
[1:48:28] brother prana. We worship Jesus Christ.
[1:48:31] A young man who knew how to discern good
[1:48:35] from evil. 25 years old. Look at your
[1:48:39] age today.
[1:48:39] [Applause]
[1:48:41] Amen.
[1:48:45] Amen. Swallow everything.
[1:48:49] Destroy the serpent of Moses.
[1:48:52] Destroy idolatry.
[1:48:56] Anything before God.
[1:48:59] Can I continue? Amen. Verse uh five. He
[1:49:05] trusted in the Lord of God. in the in
[1:49:09] the Lord God of Israel. So that what
[1:49:12] after him was what? None like him among
[1:49:16] all the kings of what? Of Judah. Nor any
[1:49:19] that were before him.
[1:49:24] [Laughter]
[1:49:27] Can I continue? Israel started together
[1:49:31] as the nation of Israel. Yes.
[1:49:34] We clear
[1:49:36] in here. The first king was who? If you
[1:49:39] got a problem. No, no, no. The first
[1:49:41] king. Saul. Then after Saul, after
[1:49:44] David,
[1:49:46] after Solomon, the kingdom split. Are we
[1:49:50] together? The kingdom became the kingdom
[1:49:52] of Israel and the kingdom of what?
[1:49:56] And then he continue. Are we together
[1:49:59] now? So the Bible say of all the king of
[1:50:02] Judah. So from the time this kingdom
[1:50:06] started all the way to the time it
[1:50:08] finished, everybody that was before
[1:50:12] Hezekiah and everybody that was after
[1:50:15] Hezekiah, no one could be compared to
[1:50:17] Hezekiah.
[1:50:23] Are we together? Amen. This boy trusted
[1:50:26] in the Lord so much until he excelled
[1:50:29] everybody.
[1:50:31] My God. And the Bible say everybody that
[1:50:33] was before him and after him, no one
[1:50:36] could be compared to him at 25 years
[1:50:39] old. Show me young men
[1:50:42] in this message. Show me young people,
[1:50:45] show me young sisters in this message
[1:50:47] that people will look at you and say, "I
[1:50:50] never seen a Christian like this.
[1:50:55] Oh, we looking at foolishness.
[1:50:59] Amen. Amen.
[1:51:04] I hope everybody was here.
[1:51:06] Can I continue? Yes. Can I continue?
[1:51:09] Yes. Verse five. He trusted what? In the
[1:51:12] Lord God of Israel. Of Israel. So that
[1:51:14] after him was what? None like him.
[1:51:17] Remember this was spoken to Solomon.
[1:51:21] Amen. about his wisdom. Solomon has a
[1:51:24] wisdom that before him and after him no
[1:51:26] one. The only one that defies Solomon
[1:51:29] was was uh was uh Jesus Christ. He said
[1:51:32] there is a greater than Solomon right
[1:51:34] here. But as far as trusting in the Lord
[1:51:38] before him and after him no one.
[1:51:41] Amen.
[1:51:43] Amen. Amen. Verse six. For he clung to
[1:51:47] cling to attach. He clung to the Lord
[1:51:53] and departed not from following him, but
[1:51:56] did what? Kept his commandments which
[1:51:58] the Lord commanded unto what? Moses. So
[1:52:02] this boy was tight with the message.
[1:52:06] You cannot deviate this boy from the
[1:52:08] message. Follow me my friend. Verse
[1:52:11] seven. And the Lord was with him.
[1:52:16] And he did what? And he prospered. Why
[1:52:18] was he prospering?
[1:52:21] Why was this young man prospering? You
[1:52:24] want to prosper in this message? You
[1:52:25] want the Lord to be with you. This is a
[1:52:28] solution right there. Trust in the Lord.
[1:52:31] Cling unto the Lord. Stick to the word.
[1:52:38] Even if your peers are compromising,
[1:52:41] you stand by the word.
[1:52:45] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. I have family
[1:52:50] member who are not message believer.
[1:52:53] A lot of them my friend and they call me
[1:52:55] sometime to the reception the wedding
[1:53:00] as a member of the family. I will show
[1:53:02] up with my wife. Yes sir. Sometime I
[1:53:04] don't even get my children. Uhhuh.
[1:53:06] Because I know what I'm getting into it.
[1:53:09] It's a Pentecostal territory. When I get
[1:53:12] there I show up my face. When
[1:53:15] foolishness begin to start,
[1:53:18] when the music begin to get frenzy, my
[1:53:21] wife knows my signal. We just stand. We
[1:53:25] already showed up. We already give you
[1:53:27] the gift. I am out because I got to
[1:53:30] stand true to what I believe.
[1:53:34] Why do you stay in an environment that
[1:53:37] is wrong?
[1:53:38] [Applause]
[1:53:41] Oh, my friend from high school invited
[1:53:43] me. If they are drinking beer, get out.
[1:53:49] [Music]
[1:53:50] [Applause]
[1:53:54] We were just invited. Why are you
[1:53:55] staying there? It's getting out of
[1:53:58] order. Why are you staying there?
[1:54:02] No, you want to see that it pleases you.
[1:54:07] And before you know it, that spirit will
[1:54:09] leave. I have a parent who confessed to
[1:54:13] me, I took my children to a party and a
[1:54:16] spirit picked up on the children. Now
[1:54:17] the parent is suffering to remove that
[1:54:20] spirit from the children.
[1:54:22] [Music]
[1:54:25] We are a separate people. We are not a
[1:54:28] mixer. We are a separate people.
[1:54:33] [Music]
[1:54:35] [Applause]
[1:54:37] Denomination cannot cling with the
[1:54:39] message. The message is separate from
[1:54:42] denomination.
[1:54:44] Our work are separate. Our music are
[1:54:47] separate. Our dances are separate. Our
[1:54:51] talk are separate. Our entertainment is
[1:54:54] separate.
[1:54:59] Amen.
[1:55:01] Under the name of worship.
[1:55:04] Young people are worshiping. Worshiing
[1:55:06] who? Worshiing who? Worshiing who? And
[1:55:11] moving your hips and everything.
[1:55:13] Worshiing God.
[1:55:16] Amen. Under the message of the hour. And
[1:55:19] you want the pulpit to remain quiet. Not
[1:55:22] this pit. I was sent to deliver the
[1:55:25] message. Amen.
[1:55:32] Why did this young man prosper?
[1:55:36] Why? Look at the way he cling to the
[1:55:38] Lord.
[1:55:40] Amen. 25 years old.
[1:55:45] Amen. And the Lord was with him. Verse
[1:55:48] seven. And he prospered wherever he
[1:55:50] went. And he rebelled against the king
[1:55:53] of Assyria and served him water. So now
[1:55:56] we have an image
[1:55:59] who this Hezekiah is.
[1:56:02] Follow me my friend. This is the
[1:56:05] introduction to Hezekiah. So from today
[1:56:08] you know Hezekiah is a good young man.
[1:56:11] Fear the Lord. Stay with the message and
[1:56:14] God bless him for it.
[1:56:17] Amen. Amen. Let's go to chapter 20 now.
[1:56:21] That was 18. Let's go to chapter 20.
[1:56:34] The devil kill you like a frog.
[1:56:42] The devil knows that if he bring
[1:56:44] wilderness, you will kick it out. The
[1:56:46] devil start slowly. That's right.
[1:56:48] Slowly. Contemporary gospel.
[1:56:52] Contemporary. Contemporary.
[1:56:54] contemporary mavericks and then you get
[1:56:58] to this rock band and before you know it
[1:57:00] the devil say whatever he's doing now
[1:57:03] then he opened the world
[1:57:06] because you got so used to the beat and
[1:57:09] it's the same beat.
[1:57:12] It's the same beat. The same beat.
[1:57:15] Everybody do the same beat.
[1:57:20] [Applause]
[1:57:21] Go to message reception. Listen to the
[1:57:24] song.
[1:57:26] Not one message song. Every song
[1:57:29] denomination
[1:57:31] and the people are waiting for the song.
[1:57:34] They're not waiting for the evening and
[1:57:35] every No, no, no. They're waiting for
[1:57:37] the song. As soon as the song,
[1:57:38] everybody's up because that's where they
[1:57:40] came from. The devil gave you a
[1:57:43] religious nightclub
[1:57:46] to entertain your passion.
[1:57:51] [Applause]
[1:57:53] You listen to the song, you don't hear
[1:57:55] anything.
[1:58:03] Glory. Glory. Glory.
[1:58:09] [Applause]
[1:58:12] This is what it is.
[1:58:16] [Applause]
[1:58:19] This is what it is, my friend.
[1:58:23] Amen.
[1:58:26] Are we together? Amen. Are we together?
[1:58:29] Amen.
[1:58:31] Why did I come to church today? Good
[1:58:33] luck.
[1:58:35] Verse chapter 20. You there? Amen. Verse
[1:58:38] one. In those day was who? Hezekiah was
[1:58:42] what? Sick unto death.
[1:58:45] This righteous man here. This young man,
[1:58:49] this man who served the Lord sickness
[1:58:52] struck him.
[1:58:57] It is not unusual.
[1:59:00] Even if you a Christian sometime to have
[1:59:04] a cough,
[1:59:06] it doesn't mean God left you.
[1:59:11] Sickness unto death. In other word, a
[1:59:14] bad sickness
[1:59:17] like the sickness of Lazarus.
[1:59:21] Are we going together? Are we together?
[1:59:24] This boy got sick.
[1:59:29] Sat down. Lord, I'm doing everything
[1:59:32] that is right. I am clinging to the
[1:59:34] word. But this sickness came. What
[1:59:38] happened? He begin to pray.
[1:59:41] The sickness is there. Are we together?
[1:59:45] Amen. Huh? And the prophet Isaiah,
[1:59:48] Isaiah, the book of Isaiah, that's the
[1:59:50] prophet. And the prophet Isaiah, the son
[1:59:53] of Hmons, came to him and said to him,
[1:59:56] "What?" Thus sayeth the Lord. So the
[1:59:59] message is coming from who? The Lord.
[2:00:03] And which prophet? Isaiah himself. Amen.
[2:00:06] So Isaiah is coming to tell this young
[2:00:10] man the mind of God for his solution for
[2:00:15] his situation. I hope we are together.
[2:00:20] Are we together? Are we together? Amen.
[2:00:24] Set your house in order.
[2:00:28] Ah with everything that I done. I
[2:00:32] thought Isaiah is coming. that saith the
[2:00:35] Lord, rise up and walk.
[2:00:38] But Isaiah is coming. He says, "Set your
[2:00:41] house in order."
[2:00:44] In other words, it was time
[2:00:48] for this house
[2:00:50] to be set in order.
[2:00:57] Brother Glenn, I need some amen from
[2:00:59] there.
[2:01:02] Are we together? In God doesn't tell you
[2:01:06] wake up if it's not time to wake up.
[2:01:09] When God says set your house in order,
[2:01:10] in other words, that is the time to do
[2:01:12] it.
[2:01:15] In other words, the hour has come.
[2:01:20] To do what? Set your house in order.
[2:01:26] Lord, help me. Set your house in order.
[2:01:30] For you shall die
[2:01:33] and not live.
[2:01:40] Put your seat belt. Please make sure you
[2:01:43] buckle up.
[2:01:45] God doesn't change his purpose.
[2:01:51] God doesn't change his mind.
[2:01:57] William Marion Brham. Hallelujah.
[2:02:00] Brother Brham say in the infallible
[2:02:02] proof of his resurrection he says now
[2:02:05] the devil has fought after he seen that
[2:02:09] he thought he destroyed the water
[2:02:12] righteous seed at Calvary. So when the
[2:02:14] devil nailed Jesus at the cross the
[2:02:17] devil thought he say I got him. I got
[2:02:19] him. He's
[2:02:21] dead. The devil was so in frenzy that he
[2:02:27] forgot that Jesus was built with the
[2:02:30] resurrection
[2:02:33] because every child of God is built with
[2:02:36] the death and resurrection
[2:02:44] a child of God when you bring him low
[2:02:47] after a while he will come up but he
[2:02:50] will come better than the last Amen.
[2:02:55] I don't know if we together. You put
[2:02:57] Joseph at the pit, he comes up in piper
[2:03:00] house. You put him in the prison, he
[2:03:03] come back, he's at the right hand. So he
[2:03:05] goes in more power and power. So your
[2:03:08] trial is only a channel towards your
[2:03:11] elevation.
[2:03:13] [Applause]
[2:03:16] When Jesus went to her hell, when he
[2:03:19] came out, he received a name that is
[2:03:21] above every name. Are we together? And
[2:03:25] the devil thought he said, "You know
[2:03:26] what? I got him.
[2:03:29] I destroy God."
[2:03:32] Amen. And let's stand. Let's stand by
[2:03:36] just a moment. Let's stand by just a
[2:03:38] moment and watch what something take
[2:03:41] place. What a display. Could you ever
[2:03:44] imagine the omnipotent God,
[2:03:48] omnipresent God,
[2:03:50] omnisient God, the God that is so
[2:03:53] powerful,
[2:03:55] the God that is Jehovah Shama, the God
[2:03:58] that knows everything,
[2:04:01] infinite God ever let the devil defeat
[2:04:04] his purpose. Brother say not God, he
[2:04:09] will never do it.
[2:04:13] [Applause]
[2:04:14] Hallelujah. What you think is a defeat
[2:04:17] is not a defeat. It is a temporary road
[2:04:20] toward
[2:04:22] exaltation.
[2:04:23] The devil can never defeat it. My
[2:04:26] brother, follow me. Brother Brandham
[2:04:28] says in God hiding himself in
[2:04:30] simplicity. Now as we read the word and
[2:04:34] study the word of God, we found out that
[2:04:36] the way God we found out the way God
[2:04:38] does what? He cannot sir never change
[2:04:44] his program.
[2:04:47] No sir. What God
[2:04:50] says he can never go back on his word.
[2:04:57] In other words, God doesn't speak and
[2:05:01] take his word back.
[2:05:03] Then he spoke by mistake.
[2:05:06] But God doesn't make mistake. Follow me
[2:05:08] my friend. Amen. We clear on that one.
[2:05:11] God doesn't change his program. God
[2:05:14] doesn't change his mind. God doesn't
[2:05:16] change his purpose. God doesn't take it
[2:05:19] back. It will happen.
[2:05:24] The prophet Isaiah came, you shall die.
[2:05:28] Set your house in order. That is God's
[2:05:31] program.
[2:05:33] It is that says the Lord.
[2:05:37] Amen. Amen. I hope we are together. I
[2:05:41] hope we are together.
[2:05:43] Verse uh
[2:05:45] two. Then he turned his face to the wall
[2:05:53] and did what? And prayed unto the Lord.
[2:05:55] Ah in other words, Hezekiah said
[2:06:03] he got th say the Lord. Amen. That's
[2:06:06] right. Follow me, my friend. I told you
[2:06:09] this could be difficult. That say the
[2:06:11] Lord. And the boy turned around and
[2:06:13] said,
[2:06:17] kneel down.
[2:06:19] Lord God of Israel,
[2:06:22] are we together? Amen. Verse three, I
[2:06:25] beseech you. In other words, I beg you,
[2:06:28] oh Lord, remember now
[2:06:31] how I walk before you
[2:06:34] in what? In truth and with a what?
[2:06:37] Perfect. At 25 years old.
[2:06:41] And God could never argue with him.
[2:06:48] God could not come and say what you're
[2:06:49] saying is not the truth. So he knew
[2:06:52] which token he's pulling to God.
[2:06:58] In other words, father, I don't know if
[2:07:00] you got the right address.
[2:07:03] It is me.
[2:07:06] You know how I stood with your word. You
[2:07:10] know what I did?
[2:07:12] Amen. Are we together?
[2:07:14] I walk with a truth. Walk before you in
[2:07:18] truth and with a what? A perfect heart.
[2:07:20] and have done that which is good in your
[2:07:22] sight. And Hezekiah did what? Wet sword.
[2:07:27] In other words, this prayer was a nonest
[2:07:30] prayer.
[2:07:32] This was not Lord
[2:07:38] God. The Bible say he wiped soul
[2:07:44] earnestly praying. Yes sir.
[2:07:50] God listened to the
[2:07:55] [Laughter]
[2:07:58] praising verse four and it came to
[2:08:01] pass before Isaiah was gone out. So the
[2:08:06] prayer was very quick
[2:08:09] when Isaiah is still going up and
[2:08:11] telling people. Brother Brandham say
[2:08:12] Isaiah was telling people your king will
[2:08:15] die. Prepare your king is dying. Your
[2:08:18] king is dying. The anointing struck him.
[2:08:23] Go back. Go back to do what? To change
[2:08:27] that save the Lord.
[2:08:31] But God doesn't change his mind. I I
[2:08:35] that's why I told you back all up.
[2:08:39] God doesn't change his program. God
[2:08:42] doesn't take his word back. That's what
[2:08:45] brother I'm saying.
[2:08:46] [Music]
[2:08:48] He's the Holy One of Israel. Are we
[2:08:51] together? Amen. Follow me, my friend.
[2:08:54] Amen. Amen. And it came to pass, verse
[2:08:56] four, before Isaiah was gone out in the
[2:08:59] middle of the court, that the word of
[2:09:01] the Lord came to him, saying, "Turn
[2:09:02] again,
[2:09:05] and tell Hezekiah the captain of my
[2:09:08] people, thus serve the
[2:09:12] Lord. Oh
[2:09:17] the God of David, your father,
[2:09:20] I have heard your prayer.
[2:09:25] I have seen what? So God so hard because
[2:09:29] the man wept, sorry, I have seen your
[2:09:33] tears. Behold, I will do what? Heal
[2:09:37] thee. On the third day, you shall go out
[2:09:40] to the house of what? The Lord. And I
[2:09:43] will add to your days what? 15 years.
[2:09:47] Why only 15 years? Let's hold on. Hold
[2:09:51] right there. We will get to 15 years.
[2:09:54] Okay. I will add to because God Why Why
[2:09:57] didn't God say two years? Why didn't he
[2:10:00] say 50 years? Why didn't he say 20
[2:10:03] years? Only 15. Hold right there. Amen.
[2:10:06] Amen. He says, "And I will deliver you
[2:10:10] and this city out of the hand of the
[2:10:12] king of Assyria, and I will defend this
[2:10:14] city for my own sake and for my servant
[2:10:17] David." What? And Isaiah say, "Take a
[2:10:21] lamp of fig." And they took and laid it
[2:10:24] on the boil, and he did what? He
[2:10:26] covered.
[2:10:28] Now, we got a problem right
[2:10:31] here. God doesn't change his mind. Amen.
[2:10:35] God doesn't change his program.
[2:10:38] God when he speak, he doesn't take it
[2:10:41] back.
[2:10:45] For some reason, God spoke.
[2:10:48] God deliver his mind.
[2:10:51] God deliver his will.
[2:10:54] God deliver his purpose.
[2:10:58] For Hezekiah, that the time has come.
[2:11:02] Hezekiah, I must take you back to
[2:11:04] myself.
[2:11:06] Set your house in order and I'm going to
[2:11:09] take you back to myself.
[2:11:11] Hezekiah took prayer and push God.
[2:11:19] Are we are we together? Amen. And God
[2:11:22] went to the comment and God say, "Hey,
[2:11:24] hey, hey, hey, hey, that says the Lord.
[2:11:27] I'm adding 15 years." Jesus.
[2:11:32] I thought God doesn't change his mind.
[2:11:38] Don't get quiet, please. And let's
[2:11:40] preach together.
[2:11:43] Let's do this, my friend. Brother
[2:11:45] Brandham say prayer will even change the
[2:11:48] what? Program of God.
[2:11:53] [Music]
[2:11:56] You see how the message is a hot potato,
[2:11:59] brother. Brandham say prayer doesn't
[2:12:01] change the brother Brandham say God
[2:12:03] doesn't change his program
[2:12:06] now brother Brandham say prayer changes
[2:12:09] the program what do we accept
[2:12:14] are we together are we together amen
[2:12:17] brother Brandham say prayer even change
[2:12:19] what the program of God there is a
[2:12:22] prophet one time went to a king what
[2:12:24] Hezekiah and told him to put his house
[2:12:27] on in order he was going to do die for
[2:12:30] what? Thus sayith the Lord
[2:12:37] expectation. So we believe that prayer
[2:12:40] is what? The most powerful weapon that
[2:12:43] was ever put in the care of what a human
[2:12:47] being.
[2:12:48] Hallelujah. Amen. So brother Brham is
[2:12:51] showing you what you have.
[2:12:54] He said it is the most
[2:12:57] not the most powerful the most. In other
[2:12:59] words, a most the top
[2:13:03] God first give you his word. And after
[2:13:06] the word, he give you prayer. Follow me
[2:13:09] if I can get where I'm trying to go. And
[2:13:11] then the most prayer,
[2:13:14] the most weapon powerful is prayer.
[2:13:20] Follow me, my friend. Follow me, my
[2:13:22] friend. He says you not pray a one time
[2:13:25] change what the mind of God.
[2:13:32] Hallelujah. God say go to the left. You
[2:13:36] pray and God say okay go to the right
[2:13:43] by prayer. Are we together? Prayer
[2:13:46] change what? The mind of God. Did you
[2:13:49] know that?
[2:13:51] It sure did.
[2:13:53] Hezekiah was told by the Isaiah the
[2:13:56] prophet that he was going to die on what
[2:13:58] that
[2:14:01] prayer will ever will even change the
[2:14:04] program of
[2:14:05] God. Let me go back again. Brother
[2:14:08] Steven. Where are we at? He cannot never
[2:14:12] change his program. Amen.
[2:14:19] Please please you will you will make two
[2:14:23] two sermon out of this if you continue
[2:14:25] the way you continue. Brother Branam say
[2:14:28] he can never what change his program.
[2:14:31] Brother Branam says prayer can do what?
[2:14:34] Even change the program of God. And to
[2:14:36] make it worse,
[2:14:40] brother Steven, God is not a man.
[2:14:44] [Applause]
[2:14:47] that he should lie. Neither a son of man
[2:14:51] that he should what? Repent.
[2:14:55] Hallelujah. We are in the heart surgery.
[2:15:00] Are we together? Amen. The word repent
[2:15:03] is not what you thinking.
[2:15:07] The word repent doesn't mean that God
[2:15:09] sin and God is going to ask forgiveness.
[2:15:12] He's going to ask forgiveness to who?
[2:15:14] He's himself God. The word repent
[2:15:16] doesn't mean that.
[2:15:20] The word repent means this. Brother
[2:15:23] Brandham say the exposition of the seven
[2:15:25] churches. It says there was no other way
[2:15:27] to get back to God than there is no
[2:15:30] other way. What now? It is what? Repent.
[2:15:33] Repent means what? Change your mind. It
[2:15:36] means what? Turn around. Repent for we
[2:15:39] so so why will you what? Die. They
[2:15:41] needed to do what? Repent. And they must
[2:15:44] what? Repent. They need to have a what?
[2:15:46] A change of mind and turn toward what?
[2:15:49] Truth. So when they say God doesn't
[2:15:51] repent, it means God doesn't change his
[2:15:55] mind.
[2:15:58] But in the same Bible, God change his
[2:16:01] mind.
[2:16:02] [Music]
[2:16:06] Amen.
[2:16:08] He says he has said shall he what? Do
[2:16:12] it. Not do it. Do you know what it
[2:16:14] means? In other words, what God say he
[2:16:17] will do it. Amen.
[2:16:20] Oh, has he what? Spoken. He shall not
[2:16:23] what? Make it good. So he says thus
[2:16:25] sayith the Lord, you going to die.
[2:16:29] Amen.
[2:16:32] Behold, I have received a commandment to
[2:16:34] do what? To bless. And he has what?
[2:16:37] Bless. And I cannot what? Reverse it. In
[2:16:39] other words, God cannot reverse.
[2:16:42] That's right. Amen. I'm reading the
[2:16:45] Bible, my friend. But God spoke and
[2:16:49] reverse.
[2:16:56] What are we doing then? Then the Bible
[2:16:59] have contradiction.
[2:17:08] William. Therefore, if there is any
[2:17:11] what? Contradiction that anyone will
[2:17:13] think that the scripture contradict each
[2:17:16] other, that is what an error.
[2:17:24] Everybody alive enough.
[2:17:27] There is no scripture what contradicts a
[2:17:30] scripture. The contradiction is where
[2:17:33] that maybe it contradict our way of
[2:17:37] looking at it.
[2:17:40] But it doesn't contradict what itself. I
[2:17:43] have been in the what ministry going on
[2:17:46] how many years? 26 years. I have never
[2:17:49] one time found one thing in the Bible
[2:17:52] that contradict anything else that was
[2:17:54] written where in the Bible. I just know
[2:17:56] it is not there.
[2:18:02] [Music]
[2:18:06] [Applause]
[2:18:08] Are we together?
[2:18:12] Ah, with your marion bra. There is your
[2:18:16] contradiction. Looks like it. Now if you
[2:18:20] are what? Reading with a carnal mind and
[2:18:23] not a what? An open heart. It shall be
[2:18:26] what? A contradiction. Uh-huh. But if
[2:18:28] you shall read with what? Open-minded.
[2:18:31] The Holy Spirit has hid it from what?
[2:18:35] The eyes of the wise and prudent. Jesus
[2:18:37] say he thanked God for it and has
[2:18:39] revealed it to who? Babe, such as would
[2:18:41] learn. If you got a mind and not a what?
[2:18:44] A selfish mind by the what? A willing
[2:18:47] heart to learn. The Holy Ghost will
[2:18:49] teach you these things.
[2:18:51] [Music]
[2:18:54] In other words, what me and you now are
[2:18:57] pasing our mind. There is no puzzling.
[2:19:01] There is no contradiction. The message
[2:19:04] cannot contradict itself. Because the
[2:19:07] message came from the Bible. Amen. And
[2:19:10] the Bible doesn't contradict itself.
[2:19:12] Amen.
[2:19:14] It is our way of looking at You need a
[2:19:18] prophet.
[2:19:20] You need God to put it together.
[2:19:25] [Applause]
[2:19:27] Are we together? But remember, every
[2:19:30] scripture have a what? Compound meaning
[2:19:33] and a compound revelation. Amen.
[2:19:37] [Applause]
[2:19:38] Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Are we together?
[2:19:41] Amen. Are we together? Amen. What is the
[2:19:44] first meaning of this quote, this
[2:19:46] scripture that we read? God gave that
[2:19:49] save the Lord, right? And God changed.
[2:19:52] Now it's appearing like God is
[2:19:55] contradicting himself. What is the key?
[2:19:58] What is God hiding there
[2:20:02] that his children need to understand
[2:20:05] because Esther say if he pleases the
[2:20:08] king if I find favor before the king
[2:20:12] Jesus say if it is
[2:20:14] impossible nevertheless ah not my will
[2:20:17] but thy will in other words we don't
[2:20:20] want to change your mind we don't want
[2:20:21] to push you to reverse that's right
[2:20:26] what is going on brother Even yes sir.
[2:20:29] William Marion brother Brana my friend
[2:20:31] he say Hezekiah was told to make water
[2:20:35] ready and he get ready because he had to
[2:20:38] meet who? His maker. So his appointment
[2:20:40] came his flight was ready. Follow me my
[2:20:44] friend. Now Hezekiah was what? A king. A
[2:20:47] what? And a great man. Did you notice
[2:20:49] his plea here? Lord I beseech you
[2:20:51] consider I have walked before you with a
[2:20:54] what? A perfect heart. What the
[2:20:55] testimony that is to us today
[2:20:59] and it should be a man that walk who
[2:21:01] walks before God. Even death was
[2:21:05] pronounced upon the man. And yet God did
[2:21:07] what? Changed his mind about him.
[2:21:09] William Marion
[2:21:11] Bran. You again using the word change
[2:21:13] the mind.
[2:21:16] Ah brother Branam because Hezekiah
[2:21:19] wanted to do something and God say he
[2:21:23] would give us the desire of what our
[2:21:25] heart and Hezekiah time has come. He got
[2:21:30] cancer on him.
[2:21:36] Only a prophet.
[2:21:41] It's written in your Bible. It doesn't
[2:21:44] say cancer in the Bible. He give the
[2:21:46] description that he had boiled the
[2:21:48] bastard. And when brother Brandham begin
[2:21:51] to look, he said no, he was cancer. So
[2:21:53] cancer is not new. No sickness is new.
[2:21:58] Amen. Amen.
[2:22:02] Brother has a commission with cancer. Oh
[2:22:05] yeah. He came in the cancer age and they
[2:22:08] told him not even cancer. So if somebody
[2:22:11] who knows cancer better, it's brother
[2:22:13] prana. More than a doctor.
[2:22:19] Are we together my friend? This is not
[2:22:22] the milk. Ah okay. And he says brother
[2:22:26] Brandham say he got a what? a cancer on
[2:22:28] him or something another and they call
[2:22:30] it a what? A boil in that day. That was
[2:22:33] the terminology. But we know boil don't
[2:22:36] raise any water kill you. They just
[2:22:39] what? Get well. But he wants perhaps a
[2:22:41] cancer and he open up like a what a
[2:22:43] boil. God told Isaiah go up there and
[2:22:46] tell him he's going to do what? Die. And
[2:22:49] Hezekiah had something he wanted to do
[2:22:52] yet.
[2:22:55] He had an agenda.
[2:22:57] We will get to that my friend. Brother
[2:22:59] Brham said, "And God never say, "No,
[2:23:02] Hezekiah, you didn't do it." In other
[2:23:04] words, God never contradict him. But he
[2:23:07] admitted he do it. He did do it. He say,
[2:23:10] "I'm going to spare you a little um I
[2:23:14] mean um your life a little longer. I'm
[2:23:16] going to give you your request." See,
[2:23:18] because he had been a what? A just man.
[2:23:21] And he has been a what? A real servant
[2:23:23] to Christ. So the first lesson that we
[2:23:27] learn, if you are a just man
[2:23:31] and a righteous man and you are trusting
[2:23:34] in the Lord with all your heart and you
[2:23:37] living a Christian life, God will not
[2:23:40] withhold something from you.
[2:23:45] Amen. Are we together? Amen. Brother
[2:23:48] Brham says this. He says when you plead
[2:23:51] anything to God, you got to be you got
[2:23:54] to be a what? A reason for it. It's just
[2:23:57] like the scripture that I often refer
[2:24:00] to. If you say to this mountain, do
[2:24:02] what? Be moved and don't doubt but
[2:24:04] believe that what you have said will
[2:24:06] come to pass. You can have what you
[2:24:08] said. Now that is all together control
[2:24:11] on the what motive and what objective.
[2:24:14] See if he want what happen. In other
[2:24:17] word, when you serve the Lord and your
[2:24:20] motive and objective are right, you have
[2:24:23] a right to go before God and pray and
[2:24:27] God must give you what you need.
[2:24:34] Are we together? First revelation. If
[2:24:38] you serve the Lord, you cling to his
[2:24:40] word, you give God preeminence, you are
[2:24:44] minding God in everything that you do,
[2:24:46] if something happened to you as a
[2:24:49] righteous Christian, you have a full
[2:24:51] right
[2:24:53] to approach the throne of God boldly
[2:24:57] and ask God for whatever you want. If
[2:25:00] your motive and objective are right, God
[2:25:03] is duty bound to give it to you.
[2:25:06] [Applause]
[2:25:13] Because God will never withhold anything
[2:25:16] to those that love him.
[2:25:18] Are we together? Are we together? Are we
[2:25:22] together? That's why Hezekiah prayed and
[2:25:25] he wept so because the Bible says in the
[2:25:29] book of James, Elias was what? A man of
[2:25:33] what? Subject to like passions as we
[2:25:35] are. He pray how? Earnestly. He just
[2:25:38] didn't pray. He prayed earnestly.
[2:25:40] Uh-huh. Not just a prayer, but an
[2:25:44] earnest prayer. A sincere deep prayer.
[2:25:49] Amen.
[2:25:51] He earnestly prayed. Amen. That in my
[2:25:55] might not rain. And he reigned not on
[2:25:57] the earth by the space of what? Three
[2:25:59] years and six months. In the message
[2:26:01] Elijah which is Elias, brother Brandham
[2:26:03] said now he was a man just like we are.
[2:26:07] He was not an angel not more than what
[2:26:10] you and I. He had his differences and
[2:26:13] what things. And he has his what? Ups
[2:26:15] and downs in life. His life like we do.
[2:26:18] But God answered his what? Prayer.
[2:26:22] Because he did what? Prayed earnestly
[2:26:24] and sincerely. And before that kind of
[2:26:27] prayer can be made for the sick or for
[2:26:30] the end of drought or for anything that
[2:26:33] we have need of there must be a what a
[2:26:36] perfect understanding that we are
[2:26:39] praying in the will of God.
[2:26:42] I hope we are together. Make sure you
[2:26:45] are in his will. It must happen.
[2:26:48] Amen. We clear together. Are we clear
[2:26:52] together? Are we clear? Amen. Are we
[2:26:55] clear?
[2:26:57] Hezekiah prayed. God gave him the desire
[2:27:00] of his heart. Brother Steven, we
[2:27:03] understand the first lesson. A righteous
[2:27:06] man when he get in trouble, he can call
[2:27:09] 911
[2:27:12] of heaven and 911 of heaven will come
[2:27:16] and rescue him because he's a good
[2:27:18] citizen. He pay his taxes.
[2:27:25] Are we together? Are we together? But
[2:27:28] brother Stephen, the question is still
[2:27:29] lingering.
[2:27:32] God doesn't change his mind. This man
[2:27:35] came, they changed that save the Lord
[2:27:38] and they gave him what he want.
[2:27:41] What is that? We are still in second uh
[2:27:44] king. Right. We are still in verse 20 on
[2:27:48] chapter 20. Right. Right.
[2:27:51] Job to uh verse
[2:27:54] 12. Lord help me. Lord help
[2:27:58] me. If I can finish
[2:28:01] Hezekiah. Are we there? Are we there?
[2:28:06] You there? Amen. Verse 12. We on 20
[2:28:10] verse 12.
[2:28:12] And I mean at that
[2:28:16] time Beladan the son of Beadan king of
[2:28:20] Babylon send
[2:28:22] letter and present. You follow me?
[2:28:27] To Hezekiah for he had heard that
[2:28:30] Hezekiah has been what?
[2:28:33] In other words, the testimony went out
[2:28:37] and people say the king is
[2:28:40] healed and the king of Babylon.
[2:28:44] Follow me my friend. In other word, God
[2:28:48] didn't kill Ezekiah.
[2:28:51] Hezekiah survived.
[2:28:54] Now, we are talking about the life after
[2:28:57] his healing,
[2:28:59] after he got what he was asking for.
[2:29:01] Amen. Follow me. Spoken word. Then the
[2:29:05] king of Babylon came, not any king, the
[2:29:10] king of Babylon,
[2:29:12] came to visit you after you receive a
[2:29:16] testimony of changing the mind of God.
[2:29:21] Ah please, please. After you receive
[2:29:25] your testimony, you change the mind of
[2:29:28] God. God say no. You say, "Lord, please,
[2:29:31] I love this man. I love this man. I love
[2:29:33] this man." The parents say, "No, I love
[2:29:35] him. I love him. I love him." God say,
[2:29:37] "Take it." The next one who's coming is
[2:29:40] the king of Babylon.
[2:29:44] Have I ever Have I Oh, is my Bible
[2:29:46] different than you? Ah, please preach
[2:29:48] with me. Who's coming? The king of what?
[2:29:52] The king of Jerusalem. The king of
[2:29:54] Israel. Which king? Why only Babylon?
[2:30:00] The king of Babylon is sending
[2:30:01] messenger.
[2:30:03] We heard that the Lord has delivered
[2:30:06] you. We heard the great testimony. We
[2:30:08] brought you present. Ah the king of
[2:30:12] Babylon is bringing me present when
[2:30:16] Jehovah healed me.
[2:30:22] [Laughter]
[2:30:25] Can I continue? Please help me
[2:30:27] preaching. Can I continue? Amen. My
[2:30:30] friend, I have to preach this way so you
[2:30:32] soak it. If not, you will read the
[2:30:35] Bible, you don't understand. The king of
[2:30:38] Babylon came.
[2:30:40] My enemy
[2:30:43] suddenly has become a friend.
[2:30:46] God bless you.
[2:30:49] We appreciate your work and what you're
[2:30:51] doing for the kingdom of God. We brought
[2:30:54] you a contribution.
[2:30:56] We heard that you are sick. You know
[2:30:58] things happen in this world. But the
[2:31:01] Lord healed you. So he came to say good.
[2:31:04] And Hezekiah say finally the king of
[2:31:08] Babylon now begin to rem to recognize
[2:31:11] me. Follow me now. Follow me my friend.
[2:31:14] Follow me.
[2:31:17] Brother Tony say amen from there
[2:31:21] please. You there. Amen. Verse 12. And
[2:31:24] he came and heard. Verse 13. And
[2:31:26] Hezekiah hearkened to them. In other
[2:31:28] words, Hezekiah paid attention.
[2:31:33] Amen. Amen. And showed them all the
[2:31:36] house of his wife.
[2:31:40] Are you following me?
[2:31:44] the silver, the gold, the spice, the
[2:31:48] precious onment, and all the house of
[2:31:50] his armor, and all that was found in his
[2:31:53] treasure. There was nothing in his
[2:31:56] house, nor in all his dominion that
[2:32:00] Hezekiah have not watered. Show them a
[2:32:03] king of Babylon is coming trying to show
[2:32:06] friendship
[2:32:08] instead of verifying.
[2:32:10] [Applause]
[2:32:13] Follow me carefully.
[2:32:16] Amen. Hezekiah got so
[2:32:20] excited.
[2:32:22] Finally, the king of Babylon remember
[2:32:24] me. Come look at my kingdom. Look at
[2:32:28] this. He took them to the Pentagon. He
[2:32:32] opened the Pentagon. He said, "Look." He
[2:32:34] opened the CIA. He said, "Look." He
[2:32:36] opened this. He said, "Look." He opened
[2:32:39] this. He said, "Look." It was better for
[2:32:41] him to stay or die.
[2:32:46] Spoken word, we are moving now. Spoken
[2:32:49] word, we moving now.
[2:32:54] There is a portion in this sermon. I was
[2:32:57] trying to get into it, but it looks like
[2:32:59] the way you operating. I'm going to put
[2:33:01] that with Paul.
[2:33:04] Are we together? Because this thing is
[2:33:06] loaded. Are we together? Amen. The Bible
[2:33:08] said there was nothing in his house. In
[2:33:10] other words, Hezekiah say ah I'm so
[2:33:13] proud of you. Come well Fargo.
[2:33:17] Use a name password.
[2:33:20] Bank of America
[2:33:24] password 50 trulian.
[2:33:28] What else again? First citizen bank.
[2:33:32] You see you see the Lord bless me. The
[2:33:36] Lord prosper me. Come you who love to
[2:33:40] visit.
[2:33:47] Yes sir. If you notice Isaiah the
[2:33:50] prophet is not there.
[2:33:53] Isaiah is somewhere.
[2:33:56] God spoke to Isaiah. Say go see the
[2:33:59] king.
[2:34:01] Can I continue please? Where are we at?
[2:34:04] Verse 14. Then came Isaiah the who? The
[2:34:08] prophet to who? The king Hezekiah and
[2:34:10] said to him, "What says this man?" The
[2:34:13] prophet came.
[2:34:16] Hezekiah.
[2:34:18] Has when you already got in trouble and
[2:34:20] the pastor is around. God bless you,
[2:34:23] brother
[2:34:24] Stephen. It's good to see you today.
[2:34:27] It's not about good to see me. You see
[2:34:29] me every day.
[2:34:34] Isaiah say who are these?
[2:34:38] In other words, what is the identity of
[2:34:40] this?
[2:34:42] [Laughter]
[2:34:45] Hey, and from where came they to you?
[2:34:48] Where is the origin? And Hezekiah say
[2:34:52] they came from a a far country.
[2:34:57] Uh the detour of lies.
[2:35:02] When you catch your daughter, your son,
[2:35:04] what were you
[2:35:05] doing? I was
[2:35:08] going.
[2:35:10] Hey, they came from a far. We know they
[2:35:13] came from a far country. Where are they
[2:35:14] from? Where are they from? Where are
[2:35:17] they coming from? They came from a far
[2:35:20] country. Which far country? We want to
[2:35:22] know the country. We need Where they Oh,
[2:35:24] did I ask you the distance? I asked you
[2:35:27] where they came from.
[2:35:29] Can I continue? Can I continue my
[2:35:32] friend? Help me continue to the airport.
[2:35:35] He says they came from a far country
[2:35:37] even from what? Babylon.
[2:35:42] Are we there? Verse 15. And he say what
[2:35:46] have they seen in your house? How did
[2:35:47] Isaiah know?
[2:35:49] [Applause]
[2:35:51] How did Isaiah know? He said they came
[2:35:54] from Babylon. The prophet narrow his
[2:35:56] eyes. What did they see in your house?
[2:36:04] Amen. What have they seen in your house?
[2:36:07] And Hezekiah answer, "All the things
[2:36:09] that are in my house have they seen.
[2:36:12] There is nothing among my treasure that
[2:36:15] I have not showed them." Remember
[2:36:18] Hezekiah only show his material
[2:36:22] possession. But look how far Babylon is
[2:36:25] going.
[2:36:26] you there.
[2:36:28] And Isaiah said to Hezekiah,
[2:36:32] "Hear the word of the Lord, you who
[2:36:34] wanted to stay in this world."
[2:36:39] Amen. Behold the days come. In other
[2:36:43] words, look at what is happening in the
[2:36:45] future.
[2:36:47] That all that is in your house and that
[2:36:50] which your father have laid, even the
[2:36:53] inheritance, your grandpa left you.
[2:36:57] Do you follow me? Your money and what
[2:37:00] your daddy gave you. What your grandpa
[2:37:03] gave you, Amen. have laid up in store to
[2:37:08] this day shall be carried there? Into
[2:37:11] what? Babylon. Nothing shall be left. In
[2:37:15] other words, as far as you show Babylon,
[2:37:18] this is as deep as Babylon will wipe
[2:37:21] everything.
[2:37:24] Yes, sir. I want 15 more years. Can I
[2:37:28] continue? Can I continue? Says the Lord.
[2:37:31] And of your sons. Hey.
[2:37:34] Oh. Oh. Oh. Please can you read with me?
[2:37:37] Verse 18. And of your what? Sons.
[2:37:40] So his
[2:37:43] error affected his own children.
[2:37:47] Parent.
[2:37:48] Put your house in order.
[2:37:51] Parent. Put your house in order.
[2:37:54] parent put your house in order. Your
[2:37:56] error will go far than you think.
[2:38:01] Do you follow me? He says, "And of your
[2:38:04] sons that shall issue from you,
[2:38:09] these sons shall what? Which thou shalt
[2:38:12] beget?"
[2:38:14] Uhhuh. That Let's go. The sons that you
[2:38:18] have are the sons that I shall issue. So
[2:38:22] even the future children you have not
[2:38:25] give to birth yet you will have more
[2:38:28] children and the children that are
[2:38:30] coming up are already doomed.
[2:38:38] Remember those children was in in his
[2:38:41] lungs. Follow me carefully. If Hezekiah
[2:38:44] die, he died with them.
[2:38:48] My friend these are in the thunders. If
[2:38:51] Hezekiah die, he died with them and they
[2:38:54] are saved. But now Hezekiah ring, those
[2:38:57] children are coming up. And God was
[2:38:59] trying to remove them. I'm going to show
[2:39:02] you. I'm going to I have not entered
[2:39:04] brother Brham yet.
[2:39:07] Are we to please my time is gone. Work
[2:39:10] with me, my friend. Work with me, my
[2:39:13] friend. Those children were not born
[2:39:15] yet, and God wanted to take them to go
[2:39:18] together. Now, Hezekiah, the children
[2:39:21] are coming up. And God said, "The
[2:39:23] children that are coming up,
[2:39:27] can I continue? Which you shall father
[2:39:31] in the future shall they take away?
[2:39:35] And they shall be unique in the palace
[2:39:38] of the king of what? Babylon. Your
[2:39:40] children that you will be having from
[2:39:42] today, those children, they will be
[2:39:44] slave in Babylon.
[2:39:48] Amen. Amen. Amen. If you tell a normal
[2:39:52] parent that how will be the reaction of
[2:39:55] the parent?
[2:39:57] Will will the parent be happy? No. The
[2:40:00] parent will be how let's see Hezekiah.
[2:40:05] Verse verse 19. Then say Hezekiah to
[2:40:09] Isaiah, good is the word of the Lord
[2:40:12] which you have spoken. And he said, "Is
[2:40:15] it not good if peace and truth be in my
[2:40:18] days?"
[2:40:21] Do you know what it means? Do you know
[2:40:23] what it means? In other words, h in my
[2:40:26] time living here, me I will be good and
[2:40:28] when I will go and those curses will
[2:40:31] happen to my children.
[2:40:35] Now you begin to understand something
[2:40:37] different.
[2:40:39] Can I continue? Can I continue? Oh, but
[2:40:42] me my life is there. If they don't want
[2:40:44] to listen there themselves, they will
[2:40:46] reap what they want.
[2:40:49] Can I continue? Can I continue? Let's
[2:40:53] see the scene of Ezekiah. Go to 2
[2:40:56] Chronicles 32. And we're going to stop
[2:40:59] here. 2 Chronicles 32. If you can hurry,
[2:41:02] so we can stop here. 2 Chronicles
[2:41:06] 32 verse
[2:41:09] 24. And some of people's
[2:41:11] prayer of Hezekiah will be answers.
[2:41:15] Those who want to quit.
[2:41:21] You there. 2 Chronicles 32 verse 24. If
[2:41:26] you can go there, we can finish.
[2:41:28] We there. The same story because the
[2:41:31] king and the chronicles tell you the
[2:41:33] same story, but one give you more
[2:41:34] detail. Follow me and I'm heading to the
[2:41:37] airport. Buckle up. Verse 24. In those
[2:41:40] day Hezekiah was sick to death. Now you
[2:41:42] understand what it means. And prayed to
[2:41:44] the Lord and he spoke to him and gave
[2:41:46] him a water a but Hezekiah handled not
[2:41:50] again
[2:41:51] according to the benefit done to him.
[2:41:55] Yes sir.
[2:41:57] For his heart was what? Lifted up. So
[2:42:01] after God gave him that saved the Lord
[2:42:05] that changed the mind of God, a proud
[2:42:08] spirit.
[2:42:10] [Applause]
[2:42:13] Do you follow me? A proud careless
[2:42:16] spirit
[2:42:18] enter Hezekiah. When God say, "Hey, my
[2:42:22] time has come. Leave the earth right
[2:42:25] now." Hezekiah say I need to stay.
[2:42:29] God say really you crying like this?
[2:42:33] Okay, get it. As soon as that say the
[2:42:37] Lord was reversed, a proud care callous
[2:42:40] spirit came, sat down on Hezekiah.
[2:42:44] I'm going to hear the brother Brandham.
[2:42:46] The Bible says verse uh uh 25, but
[2:42:51] Hezekiah rendered not again. In other
[2:42:53] words, he didn't return back
[2:42:56] according to the benefit of in other
[2:42:58] words, God did him good, but he's not
[2:43:01] returning to God good anymore.
[2:43:05] How can a righteous man now cannot
[2:43:07] return good? Because he went past the
[2:43:11] divine purpose. He crossed the divine
[2:43:14] purpose. He entered the permissive will
[2:43:17] of God. Now the devil have a right.
[2:43:20] [Applause]
[2:43:22] Follow me, my friend. When I say things
[2:43:26] stay away, stay away because you're
[2:43:28] going to cross in bad territory.
[2:43:31] He says he says uh and and and for his
[2:43:35] uh for his heart was what? Lifted up.
[2:43:37] Therefore, there was rough upon him and
[2:43:41] upon Judah. And upon what? Jerusalem.
[2:43:44] So, everybody begin to suffer because of
[2:43:47] Hezekiah. Now the nation is suffering.
[2:43:51] The cities are suffering. God is angry
[2:43:54] with everybody because he stay alive.
[2:43:59] Amen. Can I continue? I'm almost done,
[2:44:02] my friend. Verse 26. Not withstanding,
[2:44:06] Hezekiah did what? Humbled himself for
[2:44:09] the proud of what? Of his heart. Both he
[2:44:12] and the inhabitant of what? Jerusalem.
[2:44:14] So his influence influence even the
[2:44:16] nation.
[2:44:19] Now everybody begin to behave like him.
[2:44:22] Amen. So that the wrath of God came not
[2:44:25] upon them in the days of who?
[2:44:29] You there. And Hezekiah had exceeding
[2:44:33] much water, riches and water and honor.
[2:44:35] He made himself treasure for water,
[2:44:37] silver, and for water. for gold toward
[2:44:39] Babylon for water. Precious stone toward
[2:44:41] Babylon for water. Spices toward Babylon
[2:44:43] for water toward Babylon and all manner
[2:44:46] of water, pleasant jewels toward
[2:44:48] Babylon. Storehouse also for the
[2:44:50] increase of water toward Babylon and
[2:44:52] wine and oil and store for all manner of
[2:44:55] beast and f for water flocks. Moreover,
[2:44:58] he provided him cities and possession of
[2:45:00] flock and heard in abundance. For God
[2:45:03] has given him what substance very much
[2:45:05] the substance that could be kept for his
[2:45:08] kingdom. Everything is going to Babylon.
[2:45:11] Are we there? Verse 30. This same
[2:45:13] Hezekiah also stopped the upper water
[2:45:16] course of Ghon and brought it straight
[2:45:18] down to the west side of the city of
[2:45:20] David. And Hezekiah prosper in all his
[2:45:23] water works. Watch. However, in the
[2:45:27] business of the ambassadors
[2:45:29] of the princes of what? Babylon. Do you
[2:45:32] see what I'm saying? You just read that.
[2:45:35] Who sent who sent to him to inquire of
[2:45:38] the wonder? So they came like ah we
[2:45:41] heard God did something big for you. Of
[2:45:45] the wonder. Amen. That was done in the
[2:45:48] land. God left him. Follow me. God have
[2:45:53] left him to do what? to try him that he
[2:45:56] man know all that was where in his
[2:45:59] heart. So when the king of Babylon sent
[2:46:03] people God was watching Hezekiah now
[2:46:07] and the pride that was in him a a spirit
[2:46:10] rose up and because of that he now put
[2:46:15] his entire seed
[2:46:17] his entire nation in jeopardy because of
[2:46:21] what he wanted to do. Let's finish with
[2:46:23] William Marion Brham. Brother Brham say
[2:46:27] yet he grant you permission for to make
[2:46:30] permit your will a permissive what will
[2:46:34] knowing what is in your heart. Follow me
[2:46:36] my friend. Buckle up. Yet he did what?
[2:46:40] Prospers. You say you can't believe that
[2:46:43] by prosperity. You can't judge God by
[2:46:46] what? Prosperity. The world prosper. Bam
[2:46:50] prosper. But brother, you judge God how?
[2:46:53] By his word. He keep his word and
[2:46:56] identify it what? The truth. So remember
[2:46:58] friend, as long as you live, don't never
[2:47:01] forget this. God does not change what?
[2:47:05] His mind. Yet he will what? Bless. He
[2:47:09] will let you go his permissive will, but
[2:47:11] he won't change his mind. He won't
[2:47:14] change his plan. He won't change his
[2:47:16] word for you. No, sir. You've got to
[2:47:19] change. Amen. You can't have God's word
[2:47:22] to match your experience.
[2:47:25] You got to have your experience to match
[2:47:27] what? God's word. Are we together? I'm
[2:47:30] going to the airport, my friend. Brother
[2:47:32] Brandham said, Hezekiah, as soon as he
[2:47:35] knew he was a good man, but God say your
[2:47:38] time has come, Hezekiah, I must take
[2:47:41] you. I want you. I'm going to take you
[2:47:44] out. Put all your househ how in order.
[2:47:48] He said the only one who can tell us the
[2:47:51] prayer of Hezekiah is brother Brham. Now
[2:47:55] brother Brham say Hezekiah said to God
[2:47:58] it shall take me 15 years to do that.
[2:48:04] [Music]
[2:48:08] So where is the 15 years coming from
[2:48:10] Hezekiah?
[2:48:12] [Music]
[2:48:15] Brother Steven, that is brother Brham. I
[2:48:18] don't see that in the scripture. Take
[2:48:21] Isaiah because I was sitting down and
[2:48:23] the Holy Spirit I say where is this
[2:48:26] thing with Hezekiah brother is talking
[2:48:28] about and finally
[2:48:31] you there you there take Isaiah 38 my
[2:48:34] friend last scripture Isaiah 38 where is
[2:48:38] the because Hezekiah was with Isaiah the
[2:48:41] prophet you remember? So you can find
[2:48:42] him in Isaiah. Isaiah 38. Let's go one

[2:48:57] You there? You there?
[2:49:00] Yes. Amen.
[2:49:03] Verse four. Let's go forward. I read it
[2:49:05] to then came the word of the Lord to
[2:49:07] who? Isaiah. Saying go and say to who?
[2:49:10] Hezekiah. Thus sayith the Lord the God
[2:49:12] of David. Your what? Thy father. I have
[2:49:15] heard what? Thy prayer. I have seen your
[2:49:18] tears. Behold, I will add I will add to

[2:49:31] what was Hezekiah asking in prayer? 15
[2:49:34] years.
[2:49:36] It takes brother Bran my friend. Are we
[2:49:39] together? So who was praying for 15
[2:49:41] years? Hezekiah. So Hezekiah went to God
[2:49:43] and said please give me how many years?
[2:49:45] 15 years. But God say now put your house
[2:49:48] in order. Hezekiah say 15 years. And
[2:49:51] brother Brandham is describing us.
[2:49:54] Brother Brandham say I will it will take
[2:49:56] me what? 15 years to do that Lord to do
[2:49:59] what? Set your house in order. God say

[2:50:04] me how many years? 15 years. How many
[2:50:06] times have I seen people, you need to be
[2:50:08] baptized now? Oh no, I need to wait a
[2:50:11] little bit. I'm too young. I'm too young
[2:50:13] to get baptized.
[2:50:15] Good luck. He says, "It shall take me
[2:50:18] how many years?" 15 years. You need to
[2:50:20] give your life to the Lord now. No, I
[2:50:23] need to wait a little bit.
[2:50:26] To do that now. I know I'm going. I know
[2:50:30] I'm going, Lord, but it's going to take
[2:50:32] me 15 years to put my house in order. I
[2:50:34] can't do it right now. I have not got
[2:50:36] the time to do it. I just can't get it
[2:50:39] done. Lord, let me live another 15 years
[2:50:42] so I can get this thing done. I can put
[2:50:44] my wife. See, God's commission was what?
[2:50:48] Put your house in order. He's saying how
[2:50:50] many years does he need? 15. Don't
[2:50:52] worry. I'm s I'm finishing with brother
[2:50:54] Brandham. Hezekiah say I can I can do it
[2:50:58] in this year. It's going to take me
[2:51:01] time.
[2:51:02] It looks like God is your friend.
[2:51:07] God, I understand, but I need my time.
[2:51:13] It's I take this back and make this up
[2:51:17] and take it over there to this fellow
[2:51:19] here. It shall take me 15. In other
[2:51:21] words, I need to fix with this. I need
[2:51:22] to go fix this. I need and all of that
[2:51:24] need 15 years. Wow.
[2:51:28] It shall take me 15 years to do it. Just
[2:51:30] spare me to do it. Give me a little time
[2:51:33] to do it. See, then God say, I'll be
[2:51:36] what? Lenion. Do you know what lenient
[2:51:38] mean? I'll be permissive. I'm going to
[2:51:40] tolerate but the demon is coming on you.
[2:51:44] But he had to die what? Anyhow, even
[2:51:47] after 15 years, you will die.
[2:51:50] And you asking God for 15 years when the
[2:51:53] perfect time was thus say the Lord.
[2:51:56] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He
[2:52:00] says, "And then again he took his time.
[2:52:03] He backsliding."
[2:52:05] This is brother Brandham. During that
[2:52:06] time,
[2:52:08] follow me my friend. He would be better.
[2:52:13] If he would have went on without it
[2:52:16] being set in order.
[2:52:19] Brother Brham say it was better. Leave
[2:52:22] the house. You go because you carrying
[2:52:25] your children. Go with your children.
[2:52:30] Amen. Hallelujah. That's right. But he
[2:52:33] gave him 15 years longer to put his
[2:52:36] house on order because quickly what he
[2:52:38] did, what did he do? He said, "Lord, I
[2:52:41] am slow. I need 15 years to do it. You
[2:52:44] got commissioned me to put my house in
[2:52:46] order. I can't do it for 15 years
[2:52:47] because I got a loan here."
[2:52:52] [Music]
[2:52:54] Ah, shake somebody's head. We going to
[2:52:57] the
[2:52:59] airport. Shake somebody's head. We going
[2:53:01] to the airport.
[2:53:06] [Applause]
[2:53:14] Can I continue? You need to get prepared
[2:53:18] for the rapture. Oh, I got a loan. I got
[2:53:22] a car loan. I'm still too young. I need
[2:53:25] to enjoy my time. God need to wait for
[2:53:29] me to get married so that the rapture
[2:53:32] can come.
[2:53:35] [Applause]
[2:53:38] Fix your house. No, I need to pay a
[2:53:40] loan. Start being on church. Oh no, I'm
[2:53:44] still having a lot to say.
[2:53:50] Spare me time. God is speaking to you.
[2:53:53] He said, "I got the Lord what here and I
[2:53:56] got this way over here. I got this way
[2:53:59] over here to do." Now, he was a godly
[2:54:01] man. And God's word got to happen
[2:54:04] anyway. It's going to come to pass
[2:54:06] anyway. But he stayed for a little
[2:54:08] while, hold it off. Then he done a sin
[2:54:12] during that time. He said, "He won't
[2:54:15] make it come upon me, but he shall visit
[2:54:17] upon my children after him."
[2:54:22] So selfish. Are we together? We
[2:54:25] finishing here. All right. God spoke to
[2:54:28] the prophet. He said, "Go back and tell
[2:54:31] him I did what?" I heard him. And what
[2:54:33] did he do? He brought disgrace.
[2:54:36] Please help me. Give me five minutes. He
[2:54:39] brought what? Disgrace to the water. The
[2:54:41] whole nation. He kindled the anger of
[2:54:44] God until he would have killed him.
[2:54:47] That's why do you know that he did what?
[2:54:49] Backslid on God. He would have been far
[2:54:52] better on his will.
[2:54:56] Amen. Of nation, king and all if he
[2:55:00] would have went and took God first what
[2:55:03] thing to him. The first ticket God give
[2:55:05] take it.
[2:55:08] But he didn't see eternal life that he's
[2:55:11] going to live with God on and on and on
[2:55:12] and on. He want to spend give me 15
[2:55:15] years so I can enjoy myself before I
[2:55:17] leave this world. Amen. Amen. But he
[2:55:22] look hard on the prophet when the
[2:55:23] prophet had to go back and speak the
[2:55:25] word to God of God to him after he done
[2:55:27] this. But God say do what? Go ahead. But
[2:55:30] you see he brought what? A disgrace.
[2:55:32] That's why brother Brandham says this. I
[2:55:36] was just waking up and laying there a
[2:55:39] little bit directly. I heard something
[2:55:42] coming into the room and I look and
[2:55:44] there was something moving in the room
[2:55:46] and I jump up and I say Lord what would
[2:55:49] you have your servant know God say do
[2:55:52] not rebuke that that is the hand of the
[2:55:55] Lord
[2:55:58] they brought brother Brham a situation a
[2:56:00] message believer believing brother Brham
[2:56:03] with all his heart the baby was dying
[2:56:06] and mama pleaded and brother Brham was
[2:56:09] praying and God came. God said, "Do not
[2:56:12] rebuke that. That baby need to die.
[2:56:16] Follow me. I'm going to the airport. If
[2:56:18] you look over here, you're going to see
[2:56:20] the city of Shalot Desad on the window."
[2:56:22] Amen. Amen. God came to brother. He
[2:56:25] said, "Don't rebuke. Let that baby go."
[2:56:28] Matter of fact, baby goes to heaven.
[2:56:31] Amen.
[2:56:34] Do you follow me? Brother say, "Do not
[2:56:37] rebuke that." So I got her on the phone.
[2:56:40] I say no, God has called your baby. And
[2:56:44] so when she come over to see us, the
[2:56:47] baby died. The woman came to visit
[2:56:50] brother because I need to know. I was a
[2:56:54] good woman. I believe the message. God
[2:56:56] took the baby. He told the prophet
[2:56:58] that's the Lord take the baby. When she
[2:57:00] came to see us the night, left her at
[2:57:03] the house. When I left yesterday, she
[2:57:05] said, "What was it, brother?" Brandham,
[2:57:08] my weakness of faith.
[2:57:11] Was I weak in faith that God took my
[2:57:13] baby? Follow me. Spoken word. I said you
[2:57:16] have great faith.
[2:57:20] You pray for your baby. You and your
[2:57:23] husband hold on to it. God to raise that
[2:57:26] baby and he refused to do it because he
[2:57:30] knows what is best.
[2:57:33] [Music]
[2:57:37] I hope we are together because he knows
[2:57:40] what is what best and you still love
[2:57:43] him. That is real faith.
[2:57:55] Anybody when the mountains are moving
[2:57:58] and things can have what? Faith. But let
[2:58:01] it go backward one time. Let God say no.
[2:58:06] Amen. And see how he works. That is when
[2:58:10] you prove whether you got faith or not.
[2:58:15] [Applause]
[2:58:18] Are we together? Are we together? Well,
[2:58:21] I went out and pray again. I was in the
[2:58:24] woods that night. Then of course the
[2:58:26] little baby had to be taken care of. And
[2:58:28] then just as I was coming in the Lord
[2:58:31] Jesus, a vision strike standing in front
[2:58:33] of me and I heard his voice say, "Don't
[2:58:35] rebuke that." That is the hand of the
[2:58:37] Lord. So I knew then that God for some
[2:58:41] reason had taken her baby where to
[2:58:44] glory. And it was certainly against the
[2:58:47] will of the Lord for me to say anything
[2:58:50] contrary to it. Amen.
[2:58:53] Amen.
[2:58:55] Divine purpose and Hezekiah prayer.
[2:58:59] That's why when you pray, you say, "Thy
[2:59:02] will be done." Because God knows what is
[2:59:05] best.
[2:59:07] Hallelujah. God stop something. You keep
[2:59:10] pushing. You keep pushing. You keep
[2:59:12] pushing. You can get yourself in
[2:59:14] trouble. Amen. Amen. Let's stop here.
[2:59:19] Then we're going to pick up Paul and
[2:59:21] show you another angle.
[2:59:24] Let's stand.
[2:59:26] [Applause]
[2:59:35] Are we together? Are we together? Are we
[2:59:39] together? Keep this story in mind
[2:59:43] because without this you will have a
[2:59:45] problem understanding Paul. Yes, sir.
[2:59:48] because I know there is something
[2:59:50] lingering but we will solve it next
[2:59:52] Sunday Lord's willing when we pick up on
[2:59:55] Paul and now you're going to see what
[2:59:57] goes in because I know your
[3:00:00] question. So how do I know when a
[3:00:02] sickness is the will of God or not? Keep
[3:00:04] it in keep it keep it. How do I know
[3:00:08] when the sickness is of God or
[3:00:12] not so that I know not to pray? We'll
[3:00:16] get to that now next Sunday because this
[3:00:19] have to be put place because you going
[3:00:21] with a demand. God say no. So how do I
[3:00:27] know? Because I have not even touched
[3:00:30] the man that was born in John 9. We have
[3:00:34] not touched that man yet.
[3:00:37] Because that man was sick. We have not
[3:00:39] touched that sickness yet. Now you're
[3:00:41] going to see how do you know what can we
[3:00:45] do not to fall under Hezekiah's error
[3:00:50] next Sunday.
[3:00:52] Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[3:00:55] are approaching you humbly this
[3:00:56] afternoon. Father, thanking you for your
[3:00:59] grace, for your love and your mercy, and
[3:01:02] for everything you have been doing for
[3:01:04] us. Father, this is as far as you wanted
[3:01:07] us to go. And we thank you for speaking
[3:01:09] to our soul and touching somebody
[3:01:12] because you spoke specifically to
[3:01:15] someone this morning.
[3:01:17] Father, the time is late.
[3:01:20] Prophecy are going every single year.
[3:01:23] Things that the prophet spoke for
[3:01:26] years, they are happening
[3:01:29] simultaneously, one after the other,
[3:01:31] showing us that we don't have much time
[3:01:34] in this world. You are coming to take
[3:01:37] your bride out. Lord, may you be
[3:01:40] merciful to the young people. May you
[3:01:43] remove that spirit of rebellion and
[3:01:46] stubbornness and worldliness.
[3:01:49] May you remove any unclean spirit from
[3:01:52] them. May father you come and bring them
[3:01:55] to their conscience so that they can
[3:01:57] realize how late the hour it is. Not
[3:02:01] only young people but even adult even
[3:02:04] young children all of us together
[3:02:07] bring us to a conscience father that we
[3:02:10] can see the seriousness of the hour and
[3:02:13] lay aside like Hezekiah everything that
[3:02:16] is contrary to the word every adult that
[3:02:19] is contrary to this message and lay it
[3:02:21] aside completely so that we can trust
[3:02:24] you and serve you and not
[3:02:27] fall into the trap of Babylon.
[3:02:31] Babylon was lurking for Hezekiah because
[3:02:35] he seen how the Lord blessed Hezekiah.
[3:02:38] Babylon saw how Hezekiah gave his life
[3:02:41] to the Lord. Babylon saw the dedication
[3:02:44] of Hezekiah with the Lord and he was
[3:02:46] waiting for an opportunity. And father,
[3:02:49] there is another Babylon today, a
[3:02:51] mystery Babylon that is watching this
[3:02:54] brother that is looking around, that is
[3:02:57] investigating message churches to see
[3:02:59] what are we doing. Lord, Father, may
[3:03:02] spoken word wake up. May the young
[3:03:05] people wake up. May the parents wake up.
[3:03:10] May the adult wake up, the older wake
[3:03:12] up, the younger wake up so that we can
[3:03:14] see
[3:03:17] that Babylon is lurking. It is the time
[3:03:20] of Babylon. The pope is right there in
[3:03:23] full power. May we become serious with
[3:03:26] your word and may we give nothing way
[3:03:30] but that safe the Lord and the perfect
[3:03:33] will of God because that is what will
[3:03:35] save us. So that when the time will come
[3:03:38] that we have to depart from this world
[3:03:41] into the rapture, we won't have anything
[3:03:43] that would tell us to ask you to linger
[3:03:46] the rapture. We will be ready because
[3:03:48] the spirit and the brat say come
[3:03:52] father help us up and help us up into
[3:03:55] the water of baptism outside of so that
[3:03:57] you may touch sister Diana in a
[3:04:00] supernatural way. Father, come down and
[3:04:03] break everything. Every tie from the
[3:04:05] world, every tie from the family, every
[3:04:08] unclean spirit, everything that the
[3:04:10] devil attack her, remove it from her
[3:04:13] life and may heaven be open up and the
[3:04:15] spirit of the Lord fill her in the name
[3:04:19] of Jesus Christ.
[3:04:21] Amen. God bless you. We love you. What
[3:04:24] is your
[3:04:27] [Applause]
[3:04:31] We do have choir practice after uh the
[3:04:34] water baptism.

[3:04:43] things

[3:04:50] made me worthy of them all.
