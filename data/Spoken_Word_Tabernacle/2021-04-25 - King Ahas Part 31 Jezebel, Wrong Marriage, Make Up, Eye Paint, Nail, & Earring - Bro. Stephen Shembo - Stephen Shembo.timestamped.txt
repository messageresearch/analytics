[5:10] Above all power, followers,
[5:15] above all kings,
[5:17] [Music]
[5:19] above all nature
[5:22] and all created things,
[5:28] above all wisdom
[5:31] and all the ways of man.
[5:39] You were here before the world began.
[5:45] [Music]
[5:46] Above all kingdoms,
[5:50] above all thrones,
[5:55] above all wonders
[5:58] the world has ever known.
[6:03] Above all wealth
[6:06] and treasures of the earth,
[6:13] there's no way to measure what your word
[6:22] crucified,
[6:26] laid behind a stone.
[6:30] You live
[6:32] to die.
[6:35] Rejected and alone. Oh, like a road.
[6:42] Trembled on the ground.
[6:47] You took the fall
[6:50] [Music]
[6:51] and thought of me
[6:53] [Music]
[6:56] above all crucified. Hallelujah.
[7:01] Crucified
[7:05] and lay behind a stone.
[7:09] You live
[7:11] to die,
[7:14] rejected and alone. Oh, like a rose
[7:20] trampled on the ground.
[7:26] You took the fall.
[7:30] and thought of me
[7:35] above.
[7:39] Let's let's go to him this morning.
[7:42] Lord, what a wonderful song, Lord Jesus.
[7:45] It expresses exactly, Lord, what your
[7:48] plan was, Lord. Because you are above
[7:52] all kings, Lord, and powers and nature,
[7:55] and you are the wisdom, Lord. You're
[7:58] above all kingdoms and thrones, Lord
[8:00] Jesus, yet you sacrificed every bit of
[8:04] it, Lord, because you thought we were
[8:07] above that.
[8:10] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[8:12] We can't thank you enough, Lord God, for
[8:15] that sacrifice that you made, Lord
[8:17] Jesus.
[8:19] We ask now, Lord God, that you would
[8:21] make your presence known among us this
[8:23] morning, Lord God. That you would
[8:25] vindicate the word, Lord, as it comes
[8:27] forth, Lord. Anoint our pastor, Lord,
[8:30] that nothing hinder the word from coming
[8:31] forth as you have planned, Lord Jesus.
[8:35] Lord,
[8:38] in all that is said and done, Lord,
[8:42] let us remember, Lord, that it won't do
[8:45] us any good, Lord, unless we have that
[8:46] Holy Spirit in us, Lord.
[8:49] Lord, I could use a refilling, Lord God.
[8:53] If there's someone here that doesn't
[8:54] know you that way, Lord God, they might
[8:56] know and remember everything brother
[8:58] Steven says, Lord, and that you have
[9:00] given him, Lord, but without that Holy
[9:02] Spirit, Lord,
[9:04] please come, Lord Jesus, and give of
[9:07] yourself as you have have need in our
[9:09] midst, Lord, this morning. Walk the
[9:11] aisles, Lord. Touch every spirit and
[9:13] every soul here, Lord.
[9:16] [Music]
[9:17] Let Satan depart, Lord, in the name of
[9:19] Jesus Christ this morning. Nothing
[9:22] hinders you, Lord God.
[9:25] Have your perfect will, Lord Jesus. Let
[9:27] it lift, let us lift our voices to
[9:28] heaven and sing the songs of Zion and
[9:31] praise your name, Lord, this morning
[9:32] that we can create an atmosphere with
[9:34] which you are welcome. We believe you're
[9:36] here, Lord. We just want to make you
[9:38] feel welcome this morning. Come and have
[9:41] your way, Lord. We give you thanks with
[9:43] joy, Lord, in our heart that we can meet
[9:45] together once again in the name of Jesus
[9:47] Christ. Amen. And amen and amen. Let's
[9:51] give him a clap offering this morning.
[9:53] Hallelujah.
[9:56] Hallelujah.
[10:00] Praise God.
[10:05] I don't have a long song service this
[10:07] morning. I want to give opportunity to
[10:09] anybody that may have a song on their
[10:10] heart
[10:12] that may be with us. Amen.
[10:16] So, if anybody has anything, y'all can
[10:18] start thinking about it as we sing our
[10:19] couple of three songs. Amen. Praise the
[10:22] Lord. We're going to stay in a G.
[10:26] [Music]
[10:28] Amen. If you're in the battle for the
[10:32] Lord and the right, you just keep on
[10:35] that firing line.
[10:39] And if you win, my brother, surely you
[10:43] must fight. You must keep on the firing
[10:48] line.
[10:50] There are many dangers that we all must
[10:54] face. And if we die of fighting, it is
[10:58] no disgrace.
[11:01] Coward in the service, he will find no
[11:05] place. So keep on that firing line.
[11:11] You must fight. Be brave against all
[11:16] evil and never ever run or even lag
[11:21] behind.
[11:23] If you would win for God,
[11:28] just keep on the firing line
[11:33] and God will only use a soldier he can
[11:38] trust. You must keep on that vir.
[11:43] [Music]
[11:44] And if you wear a crown, then bear the
[11:47] cross. You must you must keep on that
[11:52] firing line.
[11:56] Life is but to labor for the master,
[12:00] dear. Help to banish evil and to spread
[12:05] good cheer. Great you'll be rewarded for
[12:09] your service here. So keep on that fiery
[12:15] line.
[12:17] You must fight, be brave against all
[12:22] evil and never ever run nor even lag
[12:27] behind.
[12:29] If you would find
[12:32] God in the right, you must keep on that
[12:36] firing line.
[12:40] And now when we get to heaven, brother,
[12:43] we'll all be glad.
[12:46] Keep on that firing line.
[12:52] I will praise the Savior for the call
[12:55] we've had. You just keep on the firing
[13:00] line
[13:03] when souls that we have helped to win.
[13:08] Leading them to Jesus from the path of
[13:12] sin.
[13:14] With the shout of welcome, we will all
[13:17] march in. So keep on that fiery line.
[13:25] You must fight. Be brave against all
[13:29] evils and never rip around nor even lag
[13:35] behind.
[13:36] If you would win for God and right, you
[13:42] just keep on the firing line. One more
[13:46] time. You must fight, be brave against
[13:51] all evil, and never ever run or even lag
[13:57] behind.
[13:59] If you would win for God and the right,
[14:04] you just keep on.
[14:07] [Music]

[15:00] land, there is a friend who walks with
[15:04] me.
[15:06] He leads me safely through the sinking
[15:11] sand. It is the Christ of Calary.
[15:18] Now this would be my prayer, dear Lord.

[16:31] that I may see thy blessed way.
[16:37] And keep me that I may be holy thine and
[16:43] sing redemption
[16:45] song someday.
[16:49] Now I will be a soldier brave and true

[18:20] I have put my faith in thee, dear Lord,
[18:25] that I may reach the golden strength.

[20:22] something or do something. And I'm not
[20:23] sure about this.

[20:41] Yeah, that sounds better. I'm going to
[20:43] sing this a little bit slow. We're not

[20:47] but I heard it the other day while I was
[20:49] mowing some grass and uh and it just

[20:54] you know.
[20:56] So, let's sing this. Amen.

[26:08] Does anybody have a praise report they'd
[26:10] like to give this morning?
[26:11] Yes, sir. Come on up.
[26:14] We'll let you give it on the microphone.
[26:16] Okay.
[26:17] Good morning, church.
[26:18] Um,
[26:20] I would like to give God the glory for
[26:23] helping me this year. I've been
[26:25] struggling with math, especially since
[26:28] it being virtual. It's been a lot like a
[26:31] lot harder and through the beginning of
[26:34] the year I kind of struggled and then
[26:37] when we took like the midterm test in
[26:40] the middle of the year I didn't I didn't
[26:42] do good at it on math at all. So um
[26:48] last quarter um I started bringing my
[26:50] grade my grade up. I did I was doing
[26:52] very well and
[26:55] about a week ago or I want to say a week
[26:59] ago I was in class and a teacher was
[27:02] telling us she said you know we're
[27:04] making failless and I was like failless
[27:07] you know so she said she said about 90%
[27:10] of everyone like in our grade was
[27:12] failing our classes and so I checked my
[27:15] grades and my teacher hasn't put my
[27:17] grades in so last night I took a test
[27:21] and
[27:23] like dur I was supposed to take the test
[27:25] Friday but I gave myself time I studied
[27:28] a little bit more for the test and I
[27:30] just I was praying very hard because I
[27:33] didn't want to fail the test because
[27:34] it's a important test so I talked to my
[27:38] parents and you know they told me you
[27:40] know to pray consecrate myself and don't
[27:43] let the the pressure get to me so I took
[27:47] the test and like this whole week I was
[27:50] studying for the test and I opened the
[27:52] test. I was like, "Huh?" It was like
[27:54] real simple. I was like, "No way." So, I
[27:56] I took the test, I kept taking it and
[27:59] when I I finished the test early and
[28:02] because she my teacher, she times our
[28:04] test and I usually don't finish on time,
[28:07] but this time I finished on time and I
[28:11] finished taking the test and it said I
[28:13] did real good on the test. I said I got
[28:15] some questions wrong, but I looked back
[28:17] on like uh it was like the paper where I
[28:19] took the test on. I looked back on it
[28:21] and had some typos on it. So, I told my
[28:23] teacher and then I checked my grade and
[28:28] I have like a awesome I have a A in the
[28:30] class and I was so happy. So,
[28:33] I
[28:36] [Applause]
[28:38] just wanted to give God the glory for,
[28:40] you know, pushing me through this year
[28:42] and helping me
[28:48] [Applause]
[28:50] Okay. Well, I have a 153 in my math
[28:54] class.
[28:54] That's good. That's good. 15. Good.
[29:00] Hallelujah.
[29:02] Glory. That's awesome. You know, a lot
[29:05] of people I mean, my kids are all out of
[29:07] school now, but I do try to remain
[29:09] conscious, you know, that our kids,
[29:11] they've been having it rough for the
[29:12] last year trying to do this at home. I
[29:15] mean, you know, I mean, we tried
[29:17] homeschooling ours, but we put their
[29:19] teacher on a screen, you know, and and
[29:21] had a like streaming uh the class and
[29:24] and uh and it's tough doing that because
[29:26] they, you know, you turn your back on
[29:27] them and they they watching cartoons or
[29:30] something, you know, got another tab up,
[29:32] you know. So, but that's great. That's
[29:34] awesome, brother. That's that's great.
[29:36] Anybody else have anything this morning?
[29:38] Yes, sir. Come on up, Brother Kimma.
[29:42] God bless you, church. Um, I just wanted
[29:46] to thank God for his healing power.
[29:50] Last week when brother Steven came up
[29:53] here um he started singing only believe
[29:57] and my back was just like somebody took
[30:01] a the hammer that brother
[30:05] um was destroying that church over there
[30:07] just whacked me in the back. What
[30:10] happened was that my job we I have an
[30:13] account. It's called Senior Solution.
[30:16] It's like meals on wheel. And so some
[30:20] days I'll do it by myself. Some days the
[30:22] guys they have this forklift. It'll come
[30:25] raise up and be right behind my truck.
[30:28] And they bring a pallet. So I bring the
[30:30] milk in six high stack six high. And I
[30:34] pull it, place it on the um on the
[30:37] pallet. And now I'm like up here off the
[30:41] ground. And this happened on Monday
[30:44] about two or three weeks ago. the guy on
[30:48] Friday. You see those um those
[30:52] equipments, you can kind of move the the
[30:55] forks. If you want to transport a
[30:58] smaller pallet, you move the forks in.
[31:02] And for the large pallet, you move them
[31:04] back. Well, whoever worked on that
[31:07] forklift on Friday forgot to move it
[31:09] back. And I was the first client. And
[31:13] so, my pallet was kind of huge.
[31:16] And so when he brought it up, he forgot
[31:19] to bring it back in. So I brought the
[31:21] first stack of milk, put it in the
[31:24] center, and when I was bringing the
[31:26] second one, it jerked. And it was the
[31:30] grace of God that I mean, I should have
[31:34] been on the ground. The milk should have
[31:35] been on the ground, but he the holy the
[31:38] the the angel kept that thing steady.
[31:42] But so I twisted my back a certain way
[31:45] and I didn't feel it right then.
[31:48] So Sunday when I took my flight back on
[31:50] Saturday from the funeral, got to the
[31:53] church,
[31:55] it just I I started feeling it and I
[31:58] came up here. I said, "Brother Stephen,
[32:01] I'm hurting pretty bad." So we prayed
[32:05] and when we left, didn't feel a single
[32:08] thing. We went out went out to eat. When
[32:10] I got home,
[32:13] it fired back up again to the point
[32:16] where I had to lay on the floor. My
[32:19] little daughter here, she had to come
[32:20] and stand to make it pop on my back. I
[32:24] was on the floor. It was hurting so bad.
[32:27] I did not sleep that night. And so I had
[32:30] to get up early in the morning. My wife
[32:32] was like, "You cannot go to work like
[32:35] this." And I'm a type of person I
[32:39] hate staying away from work. I can't
[32:42] call in. I never call in. I said, "I got
[32:44] to go."
[32:47] The back aching. She said, "You're not
[32:49] going." I said, "Honey, I got to go."
[32:51] No, you better call your manager and
[32:53] tell him you're not going. So, we fought
[32:55] it. I guess what? I went.
[33:00] As soon as I got there, the back
[33:03] stopped.
[33:04] Wow.
[33:05] Amen.
[33:06] It was lifted.
[33:10] I mean, I was walking like this.
[33:13] Couldn't even get off out the bed. I got
[33:15] there, it was gone.
[33:18] Gone. Completely gone.
[33:21] You talking about this church. God is
[33:25] moving in this. I want y'all to hear me
[33:27] real well on the internet. God is moving
[33:30] in this church.
[33:33] Let's get ourselves together. We will
[33:35] see the glory of almighty God among us.
[33:39] Amen.
[33:40] Wonderful.
[33:42] I'll call you back.
[33:44] Hallelujah.
[33:47] Glory. Anybody else got anything?
[33:51] Yes, sir. Brother Abel,
[33:56] I wasn't going to say it, but after he
[33:58] gave that testimony, I was like, "Okay,
[33:59] I got to say it." So, a couple weeks
[34:01] ago, I gave a testimony about my ankle
[34:03] when I sprained my ankle. It swelled up.
[34:05] It got purple and I uh was limping on it
[34:08] and I was like, "Devil is a liar." And I
[34:10] went about my life. Well, last week I
[34:13] rolled it off of like off of something.
[34:15] I rolled over and I fell flat on my face
[34:18] and I went to get up and I couldn't even
[34:19] walk on. I was like, "Oh man."
[34:21] Immediately it started to swell up again
[34:23] and the next day it was purple and
[34:25] swollen again to where I wouldn't even
[34:26] wear my shoe. I went to work in
[34:28] flip-flops and I was kind of limping on
[34:30] it and I was like, you know what, devil
[34:32] is a liar. I went to my car, I got my
[34:34] tennis shoes out, I put them on and I
[34:36] jog two miles and the next day nothing
[34:39] and today nothing.
[34:41] Great. Amen. Amen.
[34:44] Praise the Lord.
[34:47] Praise the Lord.
[34:49] Well, I got one.
[34:52] The Lord gave me a suit.
[34:55] Okay,
[34:56] [Applause]
[34:58] that's all I'm going to say.
[35:01] And I I love it.
[35:04] I'm hot, but I love it.
[35:09] All right. Anybody got any prayer
[35:11] requests this morning? I got one I want
[35:13] to give, but I want um Brother Devin to
[35:15] tell his first.
[35:17] Um I want y'all to keep me in prayer
[35:18] because I think was Thursday morning.
[35:21] Um, I woke up, went to school virtually,
[35:24] then I took a nap in class cuz I don't
[35:26] know, I was just tired. Then I don't
[35:30] know. Um, I seen like I figured I
[35:34] thought it was my brother cuz he didn't
[35:35] go to work that morning. I thought he
[35:36] was coming in my room, but like it was
[35:39] like half of my face was covered by the
[35:41] blanket so I could I could I could see
[35:43] the body. So I came I seen him walking
[35:45] down the hallway and coming in my room
[35:48] and uh which I thought it was my brother
[35:50] but then
[35:53] I couldn't move. I was trying to speak
[35:54] to him see if it was my brother but like
[35:56] it was like I couldn't move my muscles
[35:58] or like I couldn't move anything. I I
[36:01] was trying to say something. The only
[36:02] thing I could move was my eyes and my
[36:04] lips. I was I was trying to move my
[36:07] mouth but the only thing I could move
[36:08] was my lips. I was trying to speak. Then
[36:10] I couldn't move and like it felt like a
[36:12] pressure was on me. Then I don't know
[36:18] like then I just snapped out of it. Then
[36:21] everything was gone again. I think it
[36:22] was a de demonic attack cuz it keeps on
[36:24] happening to me like this. People are
[36:26] telling me sleep paralysis and it just
[36:28] happened and it's normal. So I don't
[36:30] know what's happening. Uh so just keep
[36:31] me in prayer.
[36:34] Amen.
[36:40] Rebuke it. Okay.
[36:41] That happened to my wife when she when
[36:44] we got married. It was happening to her
[36:45] in Panama and I was stationed in North
[36:48] Dakota when we got married. It followed
[36:50] her to North Dakota. Uh she would
[36:53] sometimes find herself sleeping under
[36:55] the bed. When I I would have to leave
[36:57] our house for three days to work in the
[36:59] military. So she was there by herself.
[37:01] Didn't know anybody. Couldn't speak
[37:02] English. So she would find herself under
[37:05] the bed trying to find, you know,
[37:07] comfort from this thing. And uh I think
[37:11] I think it was there we started trying
[37:13] to, you know, get into church some. And
[37:16] she rebuked that thing and it has never
[37:19] followed her again. So throw the name of
[37:22] Jesus on him and see what happens. Okay.
[37:24] Praise the Lord. Um anybody else got
[37:29] anything? Yes, ma'am.
[37:34] What's her name?
[37:36] Cor McNair for surgery.
[37:47] Okay. So, Cora McNair, you said for
[37:51] surgery for her heart on Thursday. Okay.
[37:55] Wednesday. Okay. All right. Um, anybody
[37:59] else got anything?
[38:02] I start my new job tomorrow. I'm a
[38:04] little bit nervous about that, but I
[38:05] think I'll, you know, it's just the
[38:07] jitters because it's all new, but I am
[38:09] thankful that I have have a job as well.
[38:12] So, Brother Kimma, do you mind coming
[38:14] back up and praying over these things
[38:15] for us, please, sir? I've got a couple
[38:17] of announcements to make and then we'll
[38:18] Yes, sir.
[38:22] Brother Todd. Okay.
[38:26] Blockages. Is he going to have to go in
[38:28] for stance or anything?
[38:30] Okay. What's his last name? Do you know?
[38:35] Okay. God knows. Yeah. Okay. Let's let's
[38:38] just bow heads.
[38:41] Gracious heavenly father,
[38:44] has our precious brother uh Polycar
[38:47] preached one Wednesday night
[38:52] on Thanksgiving.
[38:54] Dear Jesus, how much that sermon touched
[38:57] me.
[38:58] You didn't even have to pray to multiply
[39:01] the bread.
[39:02] All you did was you gave thanks to
[39:05] Almighty God and the thanksgiving
[39:09] brought forth the miracle.
[39:11] Help us as a church to start giving you
[39:14] thanks.
[39:15] Dear Jesus, that you may move on the
[39:18] scene. Oh father,
[39:19] help us to raise our voices, oh God, to
[39:22] give you thanks.
[39:24] I give you thanks, Lord. Oh dear Jesus,
[39:28] thank you Lord for all that you have
[39:30] done. Sometime we ask, we ask but we
[39:34] never give you thanks.
[39:37] Help us as our Lord has showed us,
[39:39] Father, to be a a grateful people to be
[39:43] a people that return thanksgiving to
[39:45] you. And we shall see we we already are
[39:48] seeing the glory of God move among us.
[39:52] the glory of that shikina that your
[39:54] prophet spoke of. We see it here in our
[39:57] midst. Thank you, Lord. Thank you for
[39:59] your healing power. Thank you for your
[40:01] salvation. Thank you for all that you do
[40:04] for us, Lord. We we cannot say it's by
[40:08] our own might, by our own merit, but
[40:10] it's by your grace and your loving,
[40:13] tender mercy. And this morning, Father,
[40:16] we are coming again to raise our voices
[40:19] to you, Lord. You heard the request that
[40:22] went before you, our precious sisters,
[40:24] auntie. Lord, may you take her that
[40:26] surgery that's taking place before the
[40:28] doctors even touched their heart. We
[40:30] bind, oh father god, our faith together.
[40:33] As your prophet said, the third pole is
[40:36] here. May we see, oh father god, the
[40:38] third poe move among us before even the
[40:41] doctor's knife touch that heart. We
[40:44] believe you to be there, Father, to
[40:48] touch the heart, oh God, that thy heart
[40:50] may be made well, Lord. Our brother here
[40:53] who's been bothered by this demon,
[40:56] Father, we rebuke it in the name of
[40:58] Jesus Christ. You've given it power to
[41:01] your church, Lord, in the name of Jesus
[41:04] Christ. May that thing go back to hell
[41:07] in the name of Jesus Christ. Take the
[41:09] service now, Lord. continue to bless us,
[41:12] oh father, and all the other requests
[41:14] our brother Todd, oh God, may you go, oh
[41:18] father god, wherever he is, Lord, and
[41:21] may you unblock, oh father god, the
[41:23] blockages, Lord, who built the body,
[41:26] Lord Jesus, who created the body, the
[41:28] heart, if it's not you, Lord, oh God, if
[41:32] you can
[41:34] in Genesis, Lord God, 18, it is said
[41:37] there that you took dust from the earth,
[41:40] Lord, and You made three bodies.
[41:43] He only need a heart, Lord. May you
[41:45] grant it to him, Father, in the name of
[41:48] Jesus Christ. Take the offerings now,
[41:50] the tithe. May you bless it, oh Father
[41:52] God, for your kingdom.
[41:54] Bless the giver, Lord God. And those
[41:56] that don't have, may you place something
[41:57] in their hand for you do love a cheerful
[42:00] giver. In the name of Jesus Christ, we
[42:03] pray. Amen.
[42:05] God bless you.
[42:07] Hallelujah.
[42:11] Um today will be the last day um that
[42:14] you can you know give your information
[42:16] about the COOD books. So, if there's
[42:19] anybody that um has not had an
[42:21] opportunity yet and um
[42:28] yeah, building fun day at the end of the
[42:30] service. Um I was, you know, like I
[42:33] mentioned earlier, I was cutting grass
[42:35] and I listened to Brooklyn Tabernacle
[42:38] Choir Pandora Station when I do that.
[42:41] And uh that song uh Psalm 34 came on.
[42:44] You know, it was one of the songs the
[42:47] one of the last songs we sang at the
[42:48] convention, the last convention that we
[42:50] had at the previous church. And uh it
[42:52] just breaks my heart when I hear the
[42:54] song
[42:55] because I want to sing it.
[42:57] I want to sing it with a group of
[42:58] people.
[43:00] So I want to ask, you know, I mean,
[43:03] we're we're preparing
[43:05] to move into a church and but we don't
[43:08] have to wait. we can try to get together
[43:11] and if there's anyone interested, that's
[43:13] what I'm asking. If you want to sing in
[43:16] a in a group, um, let's let's get
[43:19] together. Just let me know. And and it
[43:22] doesn't have to be that song, but that's
[43:23] a wonderful song. We don't we we don't
[43:25] even need a 30 people to sing it. We
[43:28] just, you know, just a few if you're
[43:30] interested. So, um,
[43:34] just want to get get that out there
[43:36] because there's some other songs that,
[43:38] you know, that I hear and it's just it's
[43:40] it's a little bit heartbreaking. Does

[43:45] opportunity before we turn brother
[43:48] Steven Loose. Come on up, Sister

[48:16] Brother Stephen, Brother Devin has a
[48:18] song on his heart. Is that okay, sir? We
[48:20] got time. Come on up, brother.
[48:23] Praise the Lord.
[48:27] Amen.
[48:35] Um,
[48:37] C, maybe. I'm not sure. I'm not sure
[48:41] [Music]
[48:44] when the music fades
[48:49] all that stripped away
[48:53] and I simply come
[48:58] [Music]
[49:01] longing just to bring
[49:06] something that's worth
[49:09] that will bless your heart.
[49:16] I'll bring you more than a song.
[49:21] For a song in itself
[49:24] is not what you have required.
[49:29] [Music]
[49:32] You search much deeper within
[49:37] through the way things appear. You're
[49:41] looking into my heart.
[49:49] I'm coming back to the heart of worship.
[49:56] When it's all about you,
[50:00] it's all about you, Jesus.
[50:04] I'm sorry, Lord, for the things I've
[50:09] made it. When it's all about you,
[50:15] it's all about you, Jesus.
[50:21] King of endless worth.
[50:26] No one could express
[50:29] how much you deserve.
[50:33] [Music]
[50:37] Though I'm weak and bored
[50:41] and all I have is yours.
[50:45] Every single breath.
[50:50] [Music]
[50:51] I'll bring you more than a song.
[50:56] For a song itself is not what you have
[51:02] required.
[51:07] You search much deeper. If
[51:12] through the way things are, you're
[51:15] looking into my heart.
[51:22] I'm coming back to the heart of worship.
[51:29] And it's all about you.
[51:33] It's all about you, Jesus.
[51:38] I'm sorry, Lord, for the things I've
[51:43] made.
[51:45] And it's all about you.
[51:49] It's all about you,
[51:52] Jesus. I'm coming back to the heart of
[51:58] worship.
[52:00] When it's all about you,
[52:04] it's all about you, Jesus.
[52:10] give back to the heart I made.
[52:15] And it's all about you.
[52:19] It's all about you, Jesus.
[52:23] [Music]
[52:32] Hallelujah.
[52:36] [Music]
[52:39] I'm coming back to the heart of worship.
[52:46] It's all about you.
[52:50] It's all about you, Jesus.
[52:55] I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I made
[53:00] it. It's all about you.
[53:05] It's all about you, Jesus.
[53:14] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[53:17] It's all about you, Lord.
[53:20] It's all about you.
[53:23] It's all about me.
[53:25] It's all about you, Lord.
[53:29] It's all about you, Lord.
[53:32] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[53:36] Hallelujah.
[53:38] Hallelujah.
[53:40] All about you.
[53:43] Hallelujah.
[53:45] Hallelujah.
[53:49] When can we get that in our heads?
[53:53] It's not about us.
[53:55] Hallelujah.
[53:59] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[54:04] Let's sing Only Believe again this
[54:06] morning.
[54:08] [Music]
[54:12] We got others here who have God-given
[54:15] talents to sing and maybe to play other
[54:18] instruments
[54:20] and they're not using them.
[54:23] Let's pray for them. I'm not calling any
[54:25] names. I believe that everybody knows
[54:28] what gift they have. And it might not be
[54:31] singing and it might not be playing an
[54:32] instrument. It may be speaking in
[54:33] tonesues. It may be interpreting
[54:34] tongues. It may be other gifts. Even
[54:37] preaching whatever.
[54:40] Ask God to cultivate that.
[54:43] It's unprofitable to put it in the
[54:44] backyard and bury it.
[54:46] It's for the glory of him. It's all
[54:50] about him.
[54:54] Amen.
[54:55] Let's have a seat.
[54:58] Now, this is important. We have to
[55:00] believe that right?
[55:01] That's right.
[55:02] Only
[55:04] [Music]
[55:06] believe.
[55:09] Only
[55:12] believe.
[55:16] All things are possible.
[55:23] Only
[55:26] believe.
[55:28] [Music]
[55:36] All
[55:38] we believe,
[55:43] all things are possible
[55:48] when all
[55:52] me. Lord, I believe it.
[55:55] Lord,
[55:57] I believe. Amen.
[56:02] Lord,
[56:04] I believe.
[56:08] All things are possible,
[56:14] Lord. I
[56:17] believe
[56:20] Lord.
[56:23] I believe.
[56:27] Lord,
[56:29] I believe.
[56:33] All things are possible.
[56:39] Lord, I
[56:43] one more time. Jesus is here. Jesus
[56:48] is here. That's exactly right. Jesus
[56:55] is here.
[56:58] All things are impossible.
[57:04] Oh, Jesus
[57:07] is here.
[57:12] Jesus is here. Yes, Lord.
[57:16] Jesus
[57:19] is king.
[57:23] All things are possible.
[57:29] Jesus
[57:32] is.
[57:34] Amen. You believe he's here this
[57:37] morning. Hallelujah.
[57:40] We thank you Lord. We thank you for your
[57:43] presence and we thank you for your
[57:45] anointing this morning.
[57:47] Thank you musician. That will be all
[57:49] about the music. God richly bless you
[57:52] and it's good to see everybody this
[57:54] morning. Those that are present here and
[57:57] those online.
[57:59] I believe we got some family members.
[58:01] Brother Gautier from Atlanta. I seen you
[58:03] and your wife. You're welcome. Amen.
[58:07] Amen.
[58:09] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[58:14] I believe we will be taking the building
[58:16] fund offering today if I'm not mistaken
[58:19] at the end of the service. Trustees
[58:22] handle that. The next house meeting will
[58:25] be on May 22nd.
[58:28] I already received questions coming up.
[58:31] You're talking about question.
[58:34] Somebody drop a question about the
[58:36] baptism being baptized in the word or in
[58:40] the body of the Lord. I'm trying to get
[58:43] the question pretty good. So if you can,
[58:45] you didn't write your name, so I don't
[58:47] know how to talk to you. So if you write
[58:49] your name, I will go and ask you to give
[58:51] me more clarification about the
[58:53] question. So if you put it about being
[58:56] baptized into the body in the word. So
[58:58] just go ahead and rewrite it for me so I
[59:01] know exactly just trying to catch your
[59:04] mind and make sure we address it
[59:06] appropriately. Amen. But it's wonderful
[59:08] the question that is coming up. It's
[59:10] telling me that people mind are now
[59:12] sucked into the word. Amen. You're
[59:15] thinking more about what about this,
[59:16] what about this, what about this. That's
[59:18] how you grow and we want to grow. Amen.
[59:21] Blessed be the name of the Lord. At the
[59:23] end of the service, Sister Lorel and the
[59:26] deacon will be talking to the sisters
[59:29] for 15 minutes. Just 15 minute of
[59:32] fellowship. All the sisters is no
[59:35] exception. Nobody excluded. We have
[59:38] family church here. Amen. Everybody's in
[59:41] there. Sister Lurel is more specialized
[59:44] on the cooking. So what I learned
[59:46] according to brother Brandham, when you
[59:48] see a talent into somebody, just pass
[59:50] the ball and let them score. It's for
[59:53] the entire team. Amen. So when it comes
[59:56] to cooking and everything, I don't want
[59:58] to put a burden on the whole church. So
[1:00:00] we put more weight on sister L'Oreal
[1:00:02] because of that specialty. She does the
[1:00:05] big bulk of it, the body of it. Then you
[1:00:08] can bring on the little dessert back and
[1:00:11] forth. So you got more relaxed at home
[1:00:13] and then the church take care of it and
[1:00:15] then we move forward. Amen. But we don't
[1:00:18] want to put too much on her because we
[1:00:20] in the body. We don't want to burn her
[1:00:21] up completely. So we want to share the
[1:00:24] burden a little bit to all the sisters.
[1:00:27] Even if you 15 years old, you can share
[1:00:29] the burden. Amen. We want every family
[1:00:33] to participate onto this. Amen. Sister
[1:00:35] Lurel will be doing the big cooking, but
[1:00:38] to p to participate as far as showing
[1:00:41] what to do, handling the stuff, putting
[1:00:43] stuff appropriately. So, some people
[1:00:45] rest and some people are rotating, some
[1:00:48] people are resting, some people are
[1:00:49] rotating. So, it might take you a month
[1:00:51] before you come back. So, you might take
[1:00:53] a month going there and being relaxed
[1:00:56] before somebody else take over. So, if
[1:00:58] we do it once a month, it might take you
[1:01:00] maybe three months before you even come
[1:01:03] back. Amen. So it's not going to be
[1:01:05] something that is going to be heavy.
[1:01:06] It's just we want to share the burden.
[1:01:09] We want everybody to participate. We
[1:01:11] don't want a certain group only
[1:01:13] participating and other feels like they
[1:01:16] are not part of it. Or I don't feel like
[1:01:18] I need to do anything. They never ask
[1:01:20] me. No, we want to open that door. If
[1:01:23] you have a talent, bring it. If you can
[1:01:24] be a blessing, do it. If you can uh
[1:01:27] support the church every way you want to
[1:01:30] cook something that we don't know that
[1:01:31] is a specialty for your home come and
[1:01:33] bring it. Amen.
[1:01:35] So you feel like everybody has been
[1:01:37] given opportunity to participate.
[1:01:40] Everybody clear so far?
[1:01:41] So that is under the deacon because it's
[1:01:44] spiritual question and answer and it
[1:01:46] involve food. Anything that is spiritual
[1:01:49] anything that goes with food goes under
[1:01:51] the deacon. That's why the two deacon
[1:01:53] will be there where you're talking to.
[1:01:55] So the head is the deacon. Amen.
[1:01:58] So sister Lurel is just there to kind of
[1:02:01] help on the food and everybody else is
[1:02:03] welcome to bring your thought, bring
[1:02:04] your idea, share with sister Lorel and
[1:02:07] call her. You know her numbers. I don't
[1:02:09] have to give it to you here. So you know
[1:02:11] what to do, sister. I'm off from there.
[1:02:13] Amen.
[1:02:15] Blessed be the name of the Lord. So
[1:02:17] remember that. Only 15 minute and
[1:02:19] everything should be okay. Everybody
[1:02:21] clear so far?
[1:02:22] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Let's
[1:02:24] go to our sermon.
[1:02:26] Exodus chapter 34. How many
[1:02:32] listen to the sermon on Wednesday?
[1:02:36] Amen. Thank you, Jesus. Because on
[1:02:39] Wednesday, we touched the prostitute on
[1:02:42] a spiritual level. Amen. We went through
[1:02:46] every characteristic that I can I can
[1:02:50] get on a prostitute on a spiritual
[1:02:52] level. I wanted to put a foundation
[1:02:55] spiritually, then we come back on the
[1:02:57] black dog naturally. Amen. So what you
[1:03:00] see spiritual is going to be manifested
[1:03:02] on the natural. Everybody clear so far?
[1:03:05] So if somebody is sleeping, I hate to be
[1:03:08] saying this, if you're sleepy, sit on
[1:03:10] the back, stand there, we will be okay.
[1:03:13] Amen. Because sometime it's like it's
[1:03:15] contagious. It start from one person. If
[1:03:18] you start yawning and the next person
[1:03:20] start yawning. So we don't want that. If
[1:03:22] you're sleeping, just go ahead there.
[1:03:24] Don't contaminate somebody.
[1:03:28] We want people to stay awake. I'm giving
[1:03:31] scripture and quote because I don't want
[1:03:33] you to be in the air.
[1:03:35] Amen.
[1:03:36] I don't want this church to be in the
[1:03:38] air and say in the message we just do
[1:03:40] see this. In the message we just don't
[1:03:42] wear uh makeup. No. No. I don't want you
[1:03:45] to ask like that. I want you to say, "I
[1:03:47] do not wear makeup because I see it in
[1:03:49] the scripture and I see where brother
[1:03:51] Brandham say it." Period. Amen. Not just
[1:03:54] in the message, we don't do this. We
[1:03:56] don't wear a pant because we in the
[1:03:58] message. No. No. I do not wear a pen
[1:04:00] because the Bible says and brother
[1:04:03] Brandham says that's it. No more in the
[1:04:06] air.
[1:04:07] Amen. No more I'm just doing this
[1:04:09] because mama told me to do it. No. Every
[1:04:12] scripture, hearing scripture, whatever.
[1:04:14] High heel scripture. This scripture.
[1:04:16] This scripture. This scripture. This
[1:04:18] scripture. So when you fight, you don't
[1:04:20] talk to people. My pastor say
[1:04:23] if somebody say why do you do this? You
[1:04:25] say take your Bible.
[1:04:27] Open here.
[1:04:28] Open here. Open here. Open here. And you
[1:04:31] back off. When they say what? So who how
[1:04:34] do you know this? Then you pull Malachi
[1:04:36] 4.
[1:04:37] Amen.
[1:04:38] Amen. Then you pull Malachi 4.
[1:04:41] Then you tell them God send a prophet.
[1:04:45] Now it's a different story.
[1:04:47] Amen.
[1:04:49] Remember, put the scripture first. He
[1:04:51] catches it. When he comes back, he say,
[1:04:53] "Where do you get all this stuff?" Then
[1:04:54] Malachi 4 comes up because when he
[1:04:57] comes, he can slay the prophet of Ba.
[1:05:02] Exodus 34.
[1:05:04] Amen.
[1:05:06] You got me going. I will be checking on
[1:05:09] the time.
[1:05:12] Exodus 34:E14.
[1:05:15] If you dare, you can say amen.
[1:05:16] Amen.
[1:05:18] Remember in the book of Proverb, my son,
[1:05:21] you need to be connected to wisdom.
[1:05:23] Amen. It's a man connected to Christ.
[1:05:27] Christ, the wisdom of God, into
[1:05:29] marriage, into the bride of Jesus
[1:05:31] Christ. Then you are baptized into that
[1:05:33] body and you become part of uh part of
[1:05:36] the bride. Then that will protect you
[1:05:39] from a strange woman. Amen.
[1:05:42] Exodus 34:14.
[1:05:45] For you shall worship no other god. For
[1:05:49] the Lord whose name is who?
[1:05:52] You see how your God is. He doesn't want
[1:05:55] anybody to touch you.
[1:05:57] He doesn't want no preacher to touch
[1:05:58] you.
[1:05:59] He doesn't want no pastor to touch you.
[1:06:02] Amen.
[1:06:03] He want only himself.
[1:06:05] He can't share his bride with somebody
[1:06:07] else.
[1:06:09] Amen. Yes.
[1:06:11] He can't share his bride with anybody
[1:06:13] else.
[1:06:13] Your God is jealous.
[1:06:16] Amen.
[1:06:17] He can turn the whole world upside down
[1:06:21] if you touch to his brother.
[1:06:23] Amen.
[1:06:25] Amen. I hope ministers understand that.
[1:06:29] Hallelujah.
[1:06:30] He say whose name is jealous
[1:06:33] is a jealous God.
[1:06:35] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:06:37] Unless you make a covenant
[1:06:40] with the inhabitant of the land. You
[1:06:43] might be seated. God does not want you
[1:06:47] to make a covenant with the inhabitant
[1:06:50] of the land that are not part of your
[1:06:53] country. God is talking to Israel. He
[1:06:56] say you are Israel. I'm taking you to
[1:06:58] the promised land. When you get to the
[1:07:00] promised land, I don't want you to
[1:07:02] interact with the people in the promised
[1:07:04] land. And matter of fact, we already
[1:07:06] know that the people in the promised
[1:07:08] land came from the lineage of the
[1:07:10] serpent.
[1:07:11] It was the serpent lineage that went
[1:07:13] there and sat there. In other words, I
[1:07:16] don't want a repetition of what happened
[1:07:18] in Eden.
[1:07:19] Because in Eden, it was the serpent
[1:07:22] going to the woman.
[1:07:23] Then I separated them together. I say my
[1:07:26] lineage will stay in the land of Eden.
[1:07:29] And then I'm going to take the other
[1:07:30] lineage to the land of Nod. Then in
[1:07:33] Genesis 6, the daughter uh the sons of
[1:07:36] God begin to go back again to the land
[1:07:39] of Nod and begin to go to the lineage of
[1:07:42] K and begin to get married to those
[1:07:44] lineage to the women from the can
[1:07:47] lineage. And that's where Ham got his
[1:07:49] wife.
[1:07:51] That's right.
[1:07:53] Okay.
[1:07:54] That's why that's where Ham got his
[1:07:57] wife. That's why his wife committed
[1:07:59] adultery and pulled the serpent seed and
[1:08:02] crossed the ark.
[1:08:05] Amen.
[1:08:08] Hallelujah.
[1:08:10] Unless you make a covenant with the
[1:08:13] inhabitant of the land and they go a
[1:08:17] waring after their water,
[1:08:19] it's not going to be you who's going to
[1:08:22] go after their God first.
[1:08:24] It's going to be them going to their
[1:08:27] god.
[1:08:29] Watch carefully. Amen.
[1:08:31] Going after their god and do sacrifice
[1:08:34] to their god. And what and one called
[1:08:38] you and you eat of his what? Sacrifice.
[1:08:41] In other word, it's not going to be you.
[1:08:43] You getting married to them, they're
[1:08:45] fine. But they're going to tell you, you
[1:08:46] know what? I have a god.
[1:08:48] And before you know it, when they go
[1:08:50] worship their god, you're going to be
[1:08:52] invited. So the devil work with you
[1:08:54] slowly before you find yourself into
[1:08:57] idolatry without knowing what is going
[1:09:00] on. Amen.
[1:09:01] Verse 16. And that take of their water.
[1:09:06] God does not talk about the women here.
[1:09:09] He's talking about the son, the sons of
[1:09:12] God.
[1:09:13] Remember in Proverbs 7, the sons of God
[1:09:18] taking the daughter of men. Amen.
[1:09:21] Genesis 6. Now then verse 16 and that
[1:09:26] take off the daughters of the daughters
[1:09:29] their daughters to your son and their
[1:09:33] daughter go worrying after their what?
[1:09:37] So those daughter of the land those
[1:09:41] daughter which are the lineage of Cain
[1:09:44] which are which are Canaanite have a
[1:09:47] strong connection with their gods.
[1:09:52] In other word, they have a relationship
[1:09:56] with their God.
[1:09:58] Amen.
[1:09:59] Just like you need a relationship with
[1:10:02] Christ,
[1:10:03] they also have a relationship with their
[1:10:06] God or their religion. So what God is
[1:10:09] saying, if you take a daughter of the
[1:10:12] world
[1:10:13] and you bring it into Israel,
[1:10:16] that daughter of the world still have a
[1:10:18] relationship with the God of the world.
[1:10:22] Make sense so far?
[1:10:23] And if you do that, they have an impact
[1:10:26] on your sons.
[1:10:29] Amen.
[1:10:30] And go a waring after their gods. Come
[1:10:33] on. And make your sons, you see that?
[1:10:36] Yeah. go a waring after the what? After
[1:10:41] their God. They didn't say here that
[1:10:43] their daughter will follow you.
[1:10:46] That's right.
[1:10:47] Do you understand young people? The
[1:10:49] women of the world will not follow you.
[1:10:53] They want you to go over there. I seen
[1:10:56] young men backsleading in the message,
[1:10:58] going outside, pulling the women and
[1:11:01] bringing them up. Before you know it,
[1:11:03] you will see that woman have a tendency
[1:11:05] to go back. Amen.
[1:11:08] You thought you going to change them.
[1:11:10] Let's go to Deuteronomy chapter 7.
[1:11:15] Remember the daughter of Canaan. God
[1:11:17] doesn't want any relationship because
[1:11:20] they are connected to their gods. Their
[1:11:23] gods are pagan gods.
[1:11:25] Pagan gods.
[1:11:27] Hidden gods.
[1:11:28] Yes sir.
[1:11:29] Anybody clear?
[1:11:31] He's God. Pagan's god. And God is
[1:11:34] telling you that they are closely tight
[1:11:37] with their religion.
[1:11:39] So don't think you're going to bring
[1:11:41] them to Israel. They actually have power
[1:11:44] by the scripture to take you away from
[1:11:47] God.
[1:11:49] By the scripture
[1:11:51] because the scripture cannot be broken.
[1:11:54] Deuteronomy, you need to understand the
[1:11:57] laws of God.
[1:11:58] You don't put yourself in trouble and
[1:12:00] you say, "I know I have the Holy Ghost."
[1:12:03] No. the laws of God will kick in and
[1:12:05] you're going to find yourself in
[1:12:06] adultery.
[1:12:09] Amen.
[1:12:10] Don't presume too much.
[1:12:13] Your fortification is behind the word.
[1:12:16] If you stay behind the word, then God
[1:12:18] back you up. You don't go outside the
[1:12:21] word and then expect the angel to back
[1:12:23] you up.
[1:12:24] Hallelujah.
[1:12:26] Deuteronomy chapter 7 verse one. When
[1:12:29] the Lord your God shall bring you into
[1:12:31] the land when you go to possess it and
[1:12:35] has cast out many nation before you, God
[1:12:38] is going to kill them.
[1:12:40] That's a prayer answer. Brother Jimmy, I
[1:12:43] pray for you last night. I say, "I want
[1:12:45] to see you in church." And here he is in
[1:12:46] the church.
[1:12:50] Amen. I was praying last night. I
[1:12:53] prayed. I pray and he came in my mind. I
[1:12:55] pray. I say God if he can come to church
[1:12:57] and here he is this morning. Blessed be
[1:12:59] the name of the Lord. Amen. Thank you
[1:13:03] Jesus. And he said, "And when the Lord
[1:13:06] your God shall bring you into the land
[1:13:08] when you go to possess it, and has cast
[1:13:10] out many nation before you, the Hitat,
[1:13:14] you know that lineage, and the Gegoshat,
[1:13:16] you know where they come from. And the
[1:13:18] Amorite and the Canaanite, you see that?
[1:13:21] and the Perizzat and the Havite and the
[1:13:24] Jebusite, seven nation greater and
[1:13:27] mightier than you. And when the Lord
[1:13:30] your God shall deliver them before you,
[1:13:34] you shall smite them. God want you to
[1:13:37] kill them.
[1:13:39] Why? And utterly destroy them. I don't
[1:13:43] want anything to be done with them.
[1:13:46] Amen.
[1:13:47] You shall make no what? No covenant with
[1:13:52] them. No show what?
[1:13:55] Don't show mercy to the God of this
[1:13:58] world.
[1:13:59] He won't show you mercy when he get a
[1:14:02] hold of you.
[1:14:03] If he get a hold of you, he's going to
[1:14:05] slay you.
[1:14:06] That's right.
[1:14:07] Don't show mercy.
[1:14:09] No corporation to them. Verse three.
[1:14:12] Neither shall you make what?
[1:14:15] Marriages.
[1:14:17] Marriages. Young people, marriages,
[1:14:21] don't bring me one and say, "Brother
[1:14:23] Steven, I need to get married." No.
[1:14:26] You're going to find another pastor.
[1:14:29] Clear? Did you hear me?
[1:14:31] Did you hear me?
[1:14:33] Did you hear me?
[1:14:35] You're going to find another pastor.
[1:14:39] Play too much.
[1:14:41] Neither shall you make marriages with
[1:14:43] them. Your daughter you shall not give
[1:14:48] to what? His son. Now you young sister,
[1:14:51] you don't go out. Everybody clear?
[1:14:55] Nor his daughter shall you take to your
[1:14:58] son. It looks like both ways, but watch
[1:15:02] where God is insisting.
[1:15:04] Not too much on the women. Watch where
[1:15:06] he's insisting because there is a power
[1:15:09] in the woman to pull the man.
[1:15:13] Okay? There is a power in a woman to
[1:15:16] pull the man. That's why the scripture
[1:15:18] say by your life you can convert a
[1:15:21] husband that is not Christian because
[1:15:24] there is a channel in a woman that can
[1:15:26] pull a man.
[1:15:30] That just drop fresh.
[1:15:32] Amen.
[1:15:33] That's why he's insisting on the man
[1:15:36] going after women.
[1:15:40] Watch again verse four. For they will
[1:15:44] turn away your daughters.
[1:15:49] Why he's insisting on the son?
[1:15:51] They will turn away your son from
[1:15:55] following who?
[1:15:56] They have a power to remove religion
[1:15:59] away from you.
[1:16:03] Amen.
[1:16:04] That they may serve other water. Not
[1:16:07] only did they stop your relationship
[1:16:09] with God, they don't stop there. Once
[1:16:12] they cut off your relationship with God,
[1:16:14] they're going to take you to worship
[1:16:16] their God.
[1:16:19] You want to get married,
[1:16:21] you need to pray.
[1:16:24] Amen.
[1:16:26] Amen. That they may serve other God, so
[1:16:29] will the anger of the Lord be kindled
[1:16:32] against you and destroy you. How?
[1:16:36] This is what Bellam did. Just being the
[1:16:39] woman pull Israel and the fire struck
[1:16:42] Israel. Everybody clear?
[1:16:44] Go to Deuteronomy 17:17.
[1:16:48] Hallelujah.
[1:16:49] Blessed be the name of the Lord. I will
[1:16:52] try to push. I have two stops. I will go
[1:16:55] all the way to the first stop and see if
[1:16:57] I have time. If I have time, then I
[1:16:59] drive to the high heels.
[1:17:06] Deuteronomy 17:17. Everybody there?
[1:17:10] God is giving the criteria to a king in
[1:17:13] Israel. You can read this at your own at
[1:17:17] home, but I just want to
[1:17:20] get something here. This is God talking
[1:17:23] about a king.
[1:17:26] Deuteronomy 17:17.
[1:17:29] You know what? Let me give it to you.
[1:17:32] I don't want to take that time. Let's
[1:17:34] go. 15. You shall in any way set him
[1:17:39] king.
[1:17:41] Go to 14. When you are come to the land
[1:17:44] which the Lord your God gives you.
[1:17:47] I I run away from this because he's
[1:17:49] going to open a channel right there. But
[1:17:51] I will try to stay away. When you come,
[1:17:54] you are come to the land which the Lord
[1:17:56] your God gives you, and shall possess
[1:17:59] it, and shall dwell therein, and shall
[1:18:02] say, I will set a king over me, like as
[1:18:06] all the nation that are about me.
[1:18:09] That question pop up now. That's why I
[1:18:12] was running away from it because you're
[1:18:14] going to say, why did God
[1:18:17] was mad at Samuel over there when Israel
[1:18:19] requested this?
[1:18:21] There is a key mystery hidden there. I
[1:18:24] can't get into it. I was trying to run
[1:18:26] away from it. Amen.
[1:18:28] You shall in any wise set him king over
[1:18:32] you whom the Lord your God shall choose.
[1:18:34] Everybody clear?
[1:18:36] One from among your brethren shall you
[1:18:38] set king over you. So when they came to
[1:18:41] Samuel, it looks like they have a backup
[1:18:43] scripture.
[1:18:45] And God was mad at them. How can God be
[1:18:47] mad you bringing him the scripture? You
[1:18:50] see the channel?
[1:18:52] It is written,
[1:18:53] the devil bringing it.
[1:18:57] Amen.
[1:18:58] You may not set a stranger over you
[1:19:01] which is not your brother.
[1:19:03] Verse 16. But this is the king. He shall
[1:19:08] not multiply horses to himself,
[1:19:11] nor cause the people to return to Egypt
[1:19:14] to the end that he should multiply
[1:19:17] horses. For as much as the Lord has said
[1:19:20] to you, you shall hereafter return no
[1:19:23] more that way. When you go, you burn
[1:19:25] bridges. You don't go back that way.
[1:19:27] 17 is the key. Now, neither shall he
[1:19:30] multiply what?
[1:19:32] This is a king, a man do not multiply
[1:19:36] women.
[1:19:37] Why?
[1:19:40] Neither shall he multiply wife to
[1:19:42] himself that his water
[1:19:46] turn not water.
[1:19:48] The women still have the power to even
[1:19:51] take a king of Israel and turn his heart
[1:19:54] away from God.
[1:19:57] You see defenses, you see wisdom.
[1:20:00] Protect yourself behind the word.
[1:20:02] Amen.
[1:20:04] Neither shall uh that his heart turn not
[1:20:07] away. Neither shall he greatly multiply
[1:20:10] himself silver and what? Gold. Everybody
[1:20:13] clear so far? No marriage with the
[1:20:15] Canaan nothing. Everybody clear? Let's
[1:20:19] go now to one more. Then the other one
[1:20:22] I'm going to give it to you on the
[1:20:23] pulpit on our screen. When we put the
[1:20:26] screen, if you would online sometime you
[1:20:29] put double screen, put a single bigger
[1:20:31] one so they can see or somebody after
[1:20:34] church goes to review the sermon, they
[1:20:36] can follow the quotes and everything. If
[1:20:38] you would please. First Kings chapter
[1:20:41] 11.
[1:20:44] Everybody clear?
[1:20:46] Verse one.
[1:20:48] If you dare, you can say amen. Amen.
[1:20:50] But King Solomon
[1:20:53] love many water
[1:20:57] many water.
[1:20:59] You remember in the book of proverb
[1:21:02] Solomon keeps saying wisdom will protect
[1:21:05] you from a what?
[1:21:07] A strange woman. These women are
[1:21:11] strange.
[1:21:15] They are foreigner.
[1:21:20] They are not part of you.
[1:21:22] They have their own religion. Amen. King
[1:21:26] Solomon loved many strange women
[1:21:30] together with the daughter of Pharaoh.
[1:21:32] Stranger, women of the Moabites. You
[1:21:36] see,
[1:21:37] Ammonite, Edidomite,
[1:21:40] Zadonian. Remember that one. Keep in
[1:21:44] mind Zidonian. You're going to see where
[1:21:46] Jezebel came from.
[1:21:48] Okay, somebody caught it. And heat of
[1:21:52] the nation concerning which the Lord
[1:21:54] said to the children of Israel, you
[1:21:57] shall not go into them,
[1:22:00] neither shall they come into you, for
[1:22:04] surely they will do what?
[1:22:07] Turn away your water.
[1:22:10] After the water,
[1:22:11] what do you expect
[1:22:14] to happen to Solomon?
[1:22:18] What do you think?
[1:22:19] It's the law. It's going to happen.
[1:22:22] Amen.
[1:22:23] Solomon clung to these who love in love.
[1:22:27] I love her so much. And he had 700
[1:22:30] wives. They say don't multiply. He
[1:22:34] multiply. Don't go after them. He went
[1:22:37] after them.
[1:22:38] Amen.
[1:22:40] 700 wives, princesses, and 300 concuban.
[1:22:45] and his wife turned away his water,
[1:22:49] the law kick him.
[1:22:53] For it came to pass when Solomon was old
[1:22:58] that his wife turned away his heart
[1:23:00] after
[1:23:02] and we and his heart was not perfect
[1:23:05] with the Lord his God, as was the heart
[1:23:08] of David his father. For Solomon went
[1:23:11] after Asharov, the goddess of the
[1:23:14] Zidonians.
[1:23:15] and after Malcolm the abomination of the
[1:23:18] Ammonites. And Solomon did evil in the
[1:23:22] sight of the Lord and went not fully
[1:23:25] after the Lord as did David his father.
[1:23:28] Then did Solomon built a high place for
[1:23:31] Kimosh.
[1:23:33] Not only did he worship, he begin even
[1:23:35] to erect the temple for for God. The
[1:23:38] same men that built the temple of God
[1:23:41] now begin to build the temple of devils
[1:23:44] because of women.
[1:23:47] What power was in these women
[1:23:50] to maneuver a child of God?
[1:23:53] Lord, give me time.
[1:23:56] Amen. And Solomon did did uh verse 7.
[1:24:01] Then did Solomon build a high place for
[1:24:03] Kimosh, the abomination of Moab, in the
[1:24:06] hill that is before Jerusalem, and for
[1:24:09] Molech the abomination of the children
[1:24:12] of what? Ammon. And likewise did he for
[1:24:16] all his what?
[1:24:19] Strange wives which burn incense and
[1:24:22] sacrifice to their water. If he have 300
[1:24:26] 700 strange wives, how many altar did
[1:24:30] Solomon build? He built 700 churches
[1:24:35] for the God of the hidden
[1:24:38] because God you don't play with him.
[1:24:41] When he say do not touch the tree, don't
[1:24:44] touch the tree. 2 Corinthians chapter
[1:24:47] 6:14,
[1:24:49] "Be ye not an iniquity together with
[1:24:52] who?"
[1:24:54] These women do not believe the the God
[1:24:57] of Israel.
[1:24:58] They are unbelievers.
[1:25:01] Everybody clear
[1:25:03] for what fellowship?
[1:25:07] This relationship,
[1:25:10] this marriages
[1:25:12] brings fellowship.
[1:25:16] Make sense? What fellowship has
[1:25:19] righteousness with what?
[1:25:21] On this side is righteousness.
[1:25:25] Everybody clear? This is our
[1:25:27] righteousness.
[1:25:30] Clear?
[1:25:31] And what communion? These marriages
[1:25:34] bring you into communion.
[1:25:38] What communion has light with? What?
[1:25:43] Light is on this side because God is the
[1:25:45] light of Israel. This one is darkness.
[1:25:49] Remember Wednesday.
[1:25:52] And what conquered this marriage bring
[1:25:54] you in conquered?
[1:25:58] You got blend. And what conquered has
[1:26:02] crushed with who
[1:26:04] on this side is crushed. The wisdom of
[1:26:07] God with fear bion wickedness.
[1:26:14] Everybody clear? And what agreement? A
[1:26:17] marriage is an agreement.
[1:26:22] What agreement has the water.
[1:26:28] These sons of God are temples of God.
[1:26:35] If they are temple of God, who are these
[1:26:38] women?
[1:26:41] No. And what agreement has the temple of
[1:26:45] God with? Who?
[1:26:47] These women are adults made flesh.
[1:26:55] You seen them that they are human
[1:26:56] beings.
[1:26:58] You think they are human just like you.
[1:27:01] They actually the adult made flesh
[1:27:06] because you are the temple of God.
[1:27:08] Yes sir. They are adults.
[1:27:12] So when you get in agreement with them,
[1:27:15] you are already joining to idolatry.
[1:27:18] That's right. That's right.
[1:27:21] For ye are the temple of the living God.
[1:27:24] That's you. As God has said, I will
[1:27:28] dwell in them and walk in them, and I
[1:27:31] will be their God, and they shall be my
[1:27:33] people. Wherefore come out from among
[1:27:36] them
[1:27:38] and be ye water.
[1:27:40] I don't like this kind of marriages.
[1:27:43] Amen. Say the Lord. And touch not the
[1:27:46] water. These women are unclean.
[1:27:52] They are prostitute.
[1:27:55] The well is not a running well of water
[1:27:59] because a running well of water is
[1:28:01] self-cleansing.
[1:28:02] Amen. and touch not the unclean thing
[1:28:06] and I will receive you and I will be a
[1:28:09] father unto you and ye shall be my sons
[1:28:12] and what daughters say the lord almighty
[1:28:16] let's pray heavenly father lord we thank
[1:28:19] you again for your grace your love your
[1:28:21] mercy father and for everything you have
[1:28:24] been doing for us lord we have done what
[1:28:27] every man here might do s lord but
[1:28:31] father to come interpret the word and
[1:28:33] bless your children. That is an action
[1:28:36] of the supernatural work of the Holy
[1:28:38] Spirit. Lord, may you move me completely
[1:28:41] out of the way. May you come and speak
[1:28:43] to your children, Father. May you touch
[1:28:45] those that have sickness in their body.
[1:28:48] May you heal them. May you break every
[1:28:50] spirit of resentment, every spirit of
[1:28:54] rebellion, every spirit of unbelief,
[1:28:57] every demonic spirit that will try to
[1:28:59] block the reception of this word in the
[1:29:03] heart of your children. Father, may the
[1:29:05] devil and his army be completely sealed
[1:29:08] out. And may only the Holy Spirit, Lord,
[1:29:11] be shut in with your children this
[1:29:13] morning. We commit it all unto the hand
[1:29:16] in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. God
[1:29:19] bless you. Let's go to part 31. Amen.
[1:29:25] On Wednesday, we talk about this
[1:29:27] prostitute.
[1:29:29] We got here from Revelation 17 and from
[1:29:32] Revelation 18. On Revelation 17, if you
[1:29:36] recall, John was taken or carried away
[1:29:39] in the spirit.
[1:29:41] In other words, it was the spiritual
[1:29:43] aspect of this woman. Then when we went
[1:29:46] in Revelation 18, we found that same
[1:29:50] woman in a natural version of her. Amen.
[1:29:54] But in the natural version of her, she
[1:29:57] had fine linen which is a form of
[1:30:00] godliness. When we went to chase after
[1:30:03] this woman, her name was a mystery. And
[1:30:06] through the prophet, because a mystery
[1:30:08] required the teaching of the spirit,
[1:30:10] brother Brham unfolded to us. And we
[1:30:13] demonstrated this on Wednesday by the
[1:30:15] quote and the scripture that the name of
[1:30:18] the woman was Jezebel.
[1:30:20] And by Jezebel, she was the great
[1:30:23] Babylon or the woman that is bringing
[1:30:26] the Babylonian Empire back again into
[1:30:30] existence. That empire that started with
[1:30:33] Nimrod was again revived in the end time
[1:30:37] by this woman. Everybody clear? And that
[1:30:40] woman according to revelation 17 is a
[1:30:43] church which we know clearly that that
[1:30:47] church have seven foundation just like
[1:30:49] the bride have seven pillars. She have
[1:30:51] seven also mountain and she sit on seven
[1:30:55] mountain. And we found out on Wednesday
[1:30:57] that the city that have seven mountain
[1:31:00] was the Vatican which is Rome talking
[1:31:03] about the Catholic church and the pope.
[1:31:05] Everybody clear so far? Now the key
[1:31:08] spiritually about this woman is this.
[1:31:12] Brother Brham says in the message the
[1:31:14] revelation of Jesus Christ. He said take
[1:31:17] the holy scripture and see if there was
[1:31:20] anybody in the Bible ever baptized using
[1:31:23] those title name father son and holy
[1:31:26] ghost. It denotes three gods. In other
[1:31:29] word here you here here you Israel the
[1:31:32] lord your god is one god. Now this is
[1:31:36] bringing three gods. Brother Brandham
[1:31:38] say it is for a pagan ceremony.
[1:31:42] Remember these women are pagans.
[1:31:44] Everybody clear? And Catholicism
[1:31:48] is nothing else in the world but a pagan
[1:31:52] form of water.
[1:31:55] So the whole in revelation 17. Jezebel
[1:32:01] is a woman that makes paganism.
[1:32:06] Everybody clear?
[1:32:07] Which we call hiddenism,
[1:32:11] which we call the life of unbelievers
[1:32:16] plus Christianity.
[1:32:19] Everybody clear? She won't kick
[1:32:22] Christianity completely away from you.
[1:32:25] Amen. Solomon, you will continue to go
[1:32:29] in the temple of your God, but you will
[1:32:31] also worship other God. She blends them
[1:32:35] together.
[1:32:37] Everybody clear?
[1:32:38] Yet God want you to kick completely
[1:32:41] Babylon out of your life.
[1:32:43] Catholicism means nothing else in the
[1:32:46] world but a pagan form of Christianity.
[1:32:49] And from the Catholic Church came Martin
[1:32:52] Luther and John Wesley Baptist
[1:32:56] Presbyterian and so forth. Those are the
[1:32:59] harlot which is the daughter of the
[1:33:01] prostitute. Everybody clear so far? Now
[1:33:04] the historian says that all evidence
[1:33:07] that Jesus was born in the month of
[1:33:10] April when all other life comes forth
[1:33:13] but they have changed it back to the
[1:33:16] 25th day of December. We already clear
[1:33:18] Christmas
[1:33:20] five days after after the pagan god so
[1:33:24] they could put their ceremony how
[1:33:28] it is still a mixing of the pagan custom
[1:33:32] the pagan lifestyle the pagan worship
[1:33:37] form of worship mixed together with
[1:33:39] Christianity.
[1:33:41] Brother Brandham say paganism and
[1:33:44] Christianity
[1:33:45] and c and catholicism is nothing in the
[1:33:49] world but a bunch of what?
[1:33:52] Pagan superstition and what?
[1:33:56] Christianity of cast.
[1:33:59] In other words, the stuff that you
[1:34:01] already abandon in your life. The stuff
[1:34:05] that was from your old worldly life.
[1:34:09] Catholicism have a power to bring that
[1:34:12] in your religion and mix it with
[1:34:15] paganism. Everybody clear?
[1:34:18] Put it together. That's right. That's
[1:34:20] true. And the Protestant the daughter
[1:34:23] that knock to it is just exactly the
[1:34:27] daughter of the mother prostitute. That
[1:34:30] is exactly the key. I want you to
[1:34:33] remember here. Jezebel in the spiritual
[1:34:36] mix paganism with Christianity.
[1:34:40] Everybody clear so far? Blessed be the
[1:34:42] name of the Lord. Since we checked the
[1:34:45] spiritual aspect on Wednesday, let's go
[1:34:48] now into the natural aspect. And the
[1:34:50] reason why we do this is for this.
[1:34:54] Everything in the natural taps the
[1:34:57] water. So what you see people doing in
[1:35:00] the natural, it is nothing else but a
[1:35:03] reflection of the spiritual. Everybody
[1:35:05] clear? Are you aware of that? Everything
[1:35:09] in the natural taps the spiritual
[1:35:13] regardless
[1:35:15] anything.
[1:35:16] Amen.
[1:35:17] You just watch the way the women act and
[1:35:22] it shall show you where the church is.
[1:35:26] The women morals is in Laia in the
[1:35:31] world. How
[1:35:33] brother Brandham say physically the
[1:35:35] morale of the women not in the spiritual
[1:35:38] in the physical in the natural aspect.
[1:35:42] It is nothing else but in the world in
[1:35:46] the cosmos which we already explained to
[1:35:48] you that the fashion of the world.
[1:35:51] Everybody clear? And that morale
[1:35:54] physically it brings the women to be
[1:35:56] howaked
[1:35:58] naked miserable blind and don't know it.
[1:36:02] Amen. The people the women of the world
[1:36:06] and the church is in the same stage.
[1:36:11] Watch the natural tap the spiritual
[1:36:14] right through each time. Everybody clear
[1:36:17] so far? So, as we getting into the
[1:36:20] natural, let's go back to Proverb 7.
[1:36:27] Everybody clear so far?
[1:36:30] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:36:32] Hallelujah. Proverb chapter 7. If you
[1:36:35] dare, you can say amen.
[1:36:37] Hallelujah.
[1:36:39] Verse one. My son, the sons of God.
[1:36:43] Again, clear. Keep my word and lay up my
[1:36:48] commandments with you. Keep my
[1:36:50] commandments and live and my law as the
[1:36:53] apple of your eyes. Bind them upon your
[1:36:55] fingers. Write them upon the table of
[1:36:58] your heart. Say to wisdom, you are my
[1:37:02] sister. We already explained you this.
[1:37:04] And call understanding your king's
[1:37:07] woman. Get in the bride. Everybody
[1:37:09] clear?
[1:37:09] Amen.
[1:37:10] Why? That day may keep you from a what?
[1:37:15] Strange.
[1:37:16] These women that Solomon went after them
[1:37:19] were strange women. Get into Christ is
[1:37:23] going to protect you from worldly women.
[1:37:26] Everybody clear
[1:37:28] that they may keep you from strange
[1:37:31] women, from the stranger which flareth
[1:37:34] with her words. The Catholic Church does
[1:37:37] the same thing. I can prove it to you in
[1:37:39] the book of Daniel.
[1:37:41] If you need that scripture, you see me.
[1:37:43] Now watch verse six. Now for at the
[1:37:47] window of my house I look through my
[1:37:49] caveman and I beheld among the simple
[1:37:54] one. The naive.
[1:37:57] Amen. Among the naive one. I discern
[1:38:02] among the who?
[1:38:04] The youth. A what?
[1:38:07] A young man. A son of God. a young man,
[1:38:14] a son of God, a youth,
[1:38:17] but that youth is naive.
[1:38:21] He have not been exposed to the world.
[1:38:24] He have not tested the world.
[1:38:27] He have not tested sex.
[1:38:30] He doesn't know anything about it. He's
[1:38:32] blind. He's naive.
[1:38:35] I watch among the and among the naive,
[1:38:39] there were many youth But among the
[1:38:42] youth, one of them draw the attention of
[1:38:46] Solomon. What is wrong with this youth?
[1:38:50] Amen. I beheld among the naive, the
[1:38:54] simple one. I discern among the youths a
[1:38:58] young man void of what? A young man
[1:39:02] without the proper protection.
[1:39:06] A young man without Christ. a young man
[1:39:10] without the proper equipment to handle
[1:39:13] life.
[1:39:14] And because of lack of that equipment,
[1:39:18] what happened to this young man?
[1:39:20] Everybody clear? Remember on Wednesday
[1:39:22] the prostitute is calling and the bride
[1:39:25] also is calling. Everybody clear?
[1:39:27] Remember the prostitute sit on the way
[1:39:30] and the bride also sit over there and
[1:39:32] everybody's calling. Wisdom is calling
[1:39:34] her children and the prostitute also is
[1:39:36] calling her children. But they found out
[1:39:38] that among those youth, one of them did
[1:39:41] not have Christ. And by lacking Christ,
[1:39:45] something attracted him to a prostitute.
[1:39:49] Everybody clear?
[1:39:51] Verse eight, passing through the street
[1:39:54] near her corner. So she already in the
[1:39:57] path of this woman. And he went the way
[1:40:00] to her house
[1:40:03] because there is no protection,
[1:40:05] no blockage. In the twilight, in the
[1:40:09] night, this is when it happened. Even
[1:40:12] though you don't go in downtown, you can
[1:40:14] do it on your computer.
[1:40:16] Everybody clear? In the night, in the
[1:40:19] evening, in the black, in the dark
[1:40:22] night, brother Brandham say at 2:00
[1:40:25] a.m., that's why the activity of devils
[1:40:29] are in the top.
[1:40:32] Young people, at 2 a.m., shut your
[1:40:34] computer.
[1:40:36] Amen.
[1:40:38] Amen.
[1:40:38] Young people, at 2:00 a.m., shut your
[1:40:41] computer. Glory to God.
[1:40:47] Hallelujah.
[1:40:48] In the twilight, in the evening, in the
[1:40:52] black, and the dark night, and behold,
[1:40:56] there met him a water
[1:40:59] with the water.
[1:41:02] The word attire means the clothing.
[1:41:08] This woman is a holot but naturally
[1:41:13] she's portraying something. She have a
[1:41:17] message different than the message of
[1:41:20] the lamb.
[1:41:21] Remember when God clothe Adam and Eve,
[1:41:24] he clothed them with a lamb skinin. But
[1:41:28] this woman have a different attire and
[1:41:31] her garment or her clothing is a
[1:41:35] clothing of a whole lot.
[1:41:39] So by just the look you can tell this is
[1:41:43] not a good woman.
[1:41:46] Everybody clear?
[1:41:47] With the attire of a harlot and a saddle
[1:41:51] of heart. The heart is the heart of
[1:41:53] Satan, the heart of Jezebel. But the
[1:41:56] attire, the natural way this woman
[1:42:00] present herself is inappropriate.
[1:42:04] Everybody clear?
[1:42:06] 1 Thessalonians 5:22.
[1:42:10] Abstand from all appearance of what?
[1:42:14] So when you see a woman that is bringing
[1:42:17] a bad appearance, you don't have to
[1:42:19] think twice.
[1:42:23] You don't have to look twice. You need
[1:42:25] to turn around and run away.
[1:42:29] Abstand from all appearance of evil and
[1:42:33] the very God of peace sanctify you holy.
[1:42:37] And I pray God your whole what?
[1:42:39] Spirit.
[1:42:40] Spirit and soul and body be preserved
[1:42:44] blameless unto the coming of the Lord
[1:42:46] Jesus Christ. Everybody clear so far? So
[1:42:49] the appearance, the natural look, not
[1:42:52] the spiritual. The natural look of this
[1:42:56] woman is a harlot because the the
[1:42:59] anointing upon the churches is the
[1:43:02] anointing of a harlot of Jezebel. So the
[1:43:06] women of the world being under the great
[1:43:09] prostitute that sits under many waters,
[1:43:12] under many people are going to be
[1:43:14] reflecting that anointing of
[1:43:16] prostitution. Everybody clear so far?
[1:43:18] Amen.
[1:43:18] There are three major keys naturally
[1:43:22] speaking with this woman Jezebel.
[1:43:26] The first key is that the induction
[1:43:31] or the interest of Jezebel into Israel
[1:43:36] is through a forbidden marriage.
[1:43:40] Do you follow me? God say, "I don't want
[1:43:43] my children to get married with strange
[1:43:46] women." Amen. But for some reason,
[1:43:50] Jezebel enter into Israel being a
[1:43:54] strange woman.
[1:43:56] What is going on, brother Stephen? The
[1:43:59] first and the very important things
[1:44:03] thing that we learn about Jezebel is
[1:44:06] that she is not a daughter of what? Any
[1:44:11] woman that is not part of your church,
[1:44:15] part of the bride, part of Christ, is
[1:44:18] considered a strange woman.
[1:44:23] Hallelujah.
[1:44:25] Nor is her induction, her entrance into
[1:44:29] the tribe of Israel one of the spiritual
[1:44:34] admission as as was that of who? Ruth de
[1:44:39] Moab. So, brother Brham is saying that
[1:44:43] the entrance of Jezebel into Israel is
[1:44:47] different than the entrance of Rof. Yet
[1:44:51] Rof was also a stranger.
[1:44:57] Hallelujah.
[1:44:59] Blessed be the name of the Lord. In the
[1:45:02] book of Ruth, chapter 1 verse 14, the
[1:45:06] Bible says, "And they Rof and Opa lift
[1:45:10] up their voice and wept again. And Opa
[1:45:15] kissed her mother-in-law, but Rof did
[1:45:18] what?
[1:45:19] Cleave unto her." One kissed goodbye and
[1:45:23] left. One cleave unto her. What does he
[1:45:27] mean?
[1:45:29] And she said, "Behold, this is Naomi.
[1:45:34] That sister-in-law
[1:45:36] is gone back unto her what?"
[1:45:39] Do you follow me?
[1:45:41] Who are the people of Orpa? The
[1:45:43] Moabitete.
[1:45:45] And unto her what?
[1:45:49] So the rejection
[1:45:51] of Orpa from following Naomi has a
[1:45:55] meaning. Oppa loved the God of Moab.
[1:46:00] That's right.
[1:46:02] Are you following me? And O love the
[1:46:05] people of Moab.
[1:46:08] Oppa love the gods of Moab. And O love
[1:46:14] the people of Moab. There was a strong
[1:46:18] spiritual relationship between Oah and
[1:46:21] her God. Oah and her nation. Opa was
[1:46:26] under the national spirit of Moab which
[1:46:30] was a demon.
[1:46:32] Do you follow me?
[1:46:34] Praise be the name of the Lord. Return
[1:46:37] there after that sister. In other words,
[1:46:39] follow her. You want me to explain you
[1:46:41] what she did? She's not just going back
[1:46:44] because she love her father. No, she
[1:46:47] love her God
[1:46:48] and she knows the way I'm going, we're
[1:46:51] going to worship a different God. and
[1:46:53] she didn't want to be part of that.
[1:46:55] Amen. She could be my my daughter-in-law
[1:46:59] as long as we stay in Moab. And she
[1:47:02] killed and my children got killed in
[1:47:04] Moab.
[1:47:05] Now I'm training her. If you truly love
[1:47:08] me, let's go all the way. She said,
[1:47:10] "Huh, I will be a part of your family.
[1:47:14] Only Naomi, if you stay in Moab, if you
[1:47:18] move from Moab, I am not going to move
[1:47:20] with you."
[1:47:22] Amen.
[1:47:22] Everybody clear?
[1:47:24] Return thy sister-in-law, and Ruth say,
[1:47:28] entreat me not to leave thee.
[1:47:32] Oh, return from following after thee.
[1:47:35] Are you ready?
[1:47:37] For whether thou goest, I will do what?
[1:47:42] Where was Naomi going?
[1:47:45] In other words, I am willing to go to
[1:47:48] Israel. Amen.
[1:47:49] Yes, sir.
[1:47:52] Come on. Everybody clear?
[1:47:55] And where thou do what?
[1:47:57] Not only do I want to go where you are
[1:48:00] going, but I want to go there and be a
[1:48:03] resident of Israel.
[1:48:05] Amen.
[1:48:06] In other words, Rof is cleaning up her
[1:48:10] life completely. Rof is rejecting Moab
[1:48:14] by her confession.
[1:48:18] Do you follow me?
[1:48:19] Is it clear so far?
[1:48:21] So I am where you go, I will go. In
[1:48:24] other words, I am renouncing Moab.
[1:48:28] Do you follow me?
[1:48:30] I am renouncing my resident as my
[1:48:34] citizenship as a Moabitete.
[1:48:37] I want to get a citizenship of Israel.
[1:48:42] Read between the line.
[1:48:44] Come our Lord th
[1:48:48] I want to also I don't want to just go
[1:48:53] and get into Israel and be a resident of
[1:48:56] Israel but I want to be part of the
[1:48:59] people of Israel.
[1:49:01] I want to blend into your people. I want
[1:49:04] to learn their lifestyle. I want to
[1:49:07] behave like them. I want to be one of
[1:49:09] them. Hallelujah.
[1:49:12] Hallelujah.
[1:49:13] The people will be my people. Come.
[1:49:17] You ready for the next one?
[1:49:20] You ready for the next one?
[1:49:21] And thy what?
[1:49:23] Will be what?
[1:49:25] I am refusing all the gods of Moab. And
[1:49:29] I'm going to take Jehovah as my God.
[1:49:34] That's the way a woman enter into
[1:49:37] Israel.
[1:49:39] Are you there? If somebody is in the
[1:49:42] world, they must become they must
[1:49:44] repent. They must be baptized. They must
[1:49:48] clean up all of the worldly habit. All
[1:49:51] of the denomination habit. Clean up
[1:49:54] everything. Accept the God of the
[1:49:57] prophet William Marion brother.
[1:50:02] Hallelujah. Then they become part of
[1:50:04] you.
[1:50:07] And the God of William Bion Brham, his
[1:50:10] name is who?
[1:50:11] The Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:50:14] Did you finish?
[1:50:16] No. Let's continue. Ruth,
[1:50:19] where the do
[1:50:22] don't even bury me back over there.
[1:50:27] [Music]
[1:50:28] Are you there?
[1:50:30] This is a Moabitete.
[1:50:33] When Jacob was taken into Egypt,
[1:50:38] before Jacob died,
[1:50:41] he said, "Don't bury me here.
[1:50:44] Take my bones to the promised land."
[1:50:47] When Joseph was about to die, he said,
[1:50:50] "Take my casket to the promised land."
[1:50:52] Who gave her a revelation to be buried
[1:50:56] in the promised land because the
[1:50:58] resurrection will happen in the promised
[1:51:01] land? I want to be part of the
[1:51:04] resurrection.
[1:51:06] Yes, sir.
[1:51:08] Hallelujah. I want to be part of the
[1:51:10] rapture.
[1:51:12] I don't just want to go in Israel and
[1:51:14] lodge in Israel. Accept your people. I
[1:51:17] accept your God. I accept the quickening
[1:51:20] power.
[1:51:22] I want to be part of that rapture.
[1:51:25] Hallelujah.
[1:51:26] Where that dest will die.
[1:51:29] And there will be what? bury in the
[1:51:32] promised land with Abraham.
[1:51:34] So when you pull Abraham, I'm also
[1:51:37] coming.
[1:51:38] Hallelujah. And the Lord do so to me.
[1:51:41] And more also if ought but death part
[1:51:45] the me
[1:51:46] when she saw
[1:51:50] when she saw that she was steadfastly
[1:51:54] minded.
[1:51:55] This was not a pleasant word.
[1:51:57] This was coming from the heart.
[1:51:59] Amen. She really mean it to go with her.
[1:52:02] Then she left speaking unto her. In
[1:52:05] other words, that's it.
[1:52:07] Let's go over.
[1:52:08] You know what happened to Ruth, right?
[1:52:10] So coming back again, Jezebel her
[1:52:14] induction into the tribe of Israel
[1:52:18] into the tribe of Israel. One one of
[1:52:20] spiritual admission was that of Ruth the
[1:52:24] Moabites. No sir, this woman was the
[1:52:27] daughter of Eshbah.
[1:52:30] King of Sodom.
[1:52:33] First Kings 16:31 who was the priest
[1:52:37] unto Austertity.
[1:52:39] He had gained the throne that is his
[1:52:42] father by murdering his predecessor
[1:52:46] Phelis.
[1:52:48] So we see right away that she was the
[1:52:52] daughter of a what?
[1:52:55] Does he click?
[1:52:56] Jesus look at the Pharisee. He said you
[1:52:58] are of your father the who?
[1:53:01] He was a murderer from the beginning.
[1:53:04] She was a daughter of a murderer. This
[1:53:07] certainly remind us of what?
[1:53:11] In other words that anointing of the
[1:53:13] canite
[1:53:16] women. That's the anointing on Jezebel.
[1:53:20] That's the anointing on women that are
[1:53:23] on the world
[1:53:24] in the world.
[1:53:26] Everybody following me? And the way she
[1:53:29] became part of Israel was not through
[1:53:32] the spiritual channel that God had
[1:53:34] ordained for gentile admission, but she
[1:53:38] came in by what?
[1:53:40] Forbidden marriage. And add to Ahab, the
[1:53:43] king of the how many tribes?
[1:53:46] 10 tribes.
[1:53:47] Number 10 is a good number.
[1:53:50] It's a bad number. Brother Brham say
[1:53:52] when the tribe were 10, they were conno.
[1:53:56] So she went to the corner part of Israel
[1:54:00] to the brother that are backsliding
[1:54:03] to the brothers that got conno to the
[1:54:07] young people that are sucked into the
[1:54:09] world. That's where that anointing is
[1:54:11] moving.
[1:54:15] The 10 tribe of Israel. Now this union
[1:54:18] as we have seen was not spiritual. It
[1:54:22] was political. And so this woman who was
[1:54:26] steep in what?
[1:54:29] The love of their gods did not have the
[1:54:32] least desire to become a worshshiper of
[1:54:37] one true God.
[1:54:39] They don't want it. Solomon, you want to
[1:54:42] marry me? I will give you what you want,
[1:54:44] but keep my temple in Israel.
[1:54:47] Everybody clear?
[1:54:48] But rather she came with the avow
[1:54:52] intention. Brother Kelly, of turning
[1:54:55] Israel away from the water. When you get
[1:54:58] married to them, they will remove you
[1:55:01] from the message.
[1:55:04] When a preacher got married to them,
[1:55:06] they will remove that preacher from the
[1:55:09] message.
[1:55:12] Hallelujah.
[1:55:14] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:55:16] Brother says, "These sons of God
[1:55:20] was the sons of Seth, the lineage of of
[1:55:24] uh of Adam. So the daughters of the
[1:55:28] Canaanite, the Caines that they were
[1:55:31] what?
[1:55:32] Beautiful." Because the sons of Seth
[1:55:35] came was the son of Adam who was the son
[1:55:38] of God. But the son, the daughters of
[1:55:42] Cain, who was the son of who? Satan. Now
[1:55:46] notice they noticed just at the end
[1:55:49] before the anti-olivian destruction that
[1:55:52] the daughters of the canat were what?
[1:55:56] Pretty and what there was something
[1:55:58] about these women that they are
[1:56:01] different than the women of Israel.
[1:56:05] They are different than the women of the
[1:56:07] lineage of Adam. There is something
[1:56:10] about these women that makes them
[1:56:13] beautiful.
[1:56:17] There is something in these women that
[1:56:20] makes them attractive.
[1:56:24] There is something these women do to
[1:56:27] make them look fair.
[1:56:32] Hallelujah.
[1:56:33] Now Jesus saying as he was in the days
[1:56:37] of Noah so shall I be in the so shall he
[1:56:40] be in the coming of the son of man.
[1:56:42] Women how?
[1:56:44] What makes them attractive?
[1:56:48] What kind of women? Canaanite.
[1:56:52] See taking the sons of God. Sons of God
[1:56:56] taking the cana to
[1:56:59] praise the name of the Lord. What is
[1:57:02] wrong with a canite woman?
[1:57:04] You ready?
[1:57:06] Okay. Now, what a difference in this
[1:57:09] day. In this day of conception, instead
[1:57:13] of him being her ruler,
[1:57:17] you follow me?
[1:57:18] When you are clinging to the women of
[1:57:21] the world,
[1:57:22] she's going to take the leadership of
[1:57:25] your home.
[1:57:29] Do you follow me? You now going to be
[1:57:31] the head of the house.
[1:57:33] She will be the one to rule your house
[1:57:36] because Jezebel was the one ruling the
[1:57:40] house of Ahab and ruling the nation of
[1:57:43] Israel together.
[1:57:44] Yes, sir.
[1:57:46] It's in the natural now.
[1:57:48] Amen. She has become his what?
[1:57:53] Paul say that they are what?
[1:57:56] Why you are what? Do you follow me?
[1:58:00] You are temple of God.
[1:58:02] But Paul didn't say that they are temple
[1:58:05] of Satan.
[1:58:07] Paul says that they are ador.
[1:58:12] You're going to worship a woman.
[1:58:17] You're going to worship the woman.
[1:58:20] Are you following me?
[1:58:21] Yes, sir.
[1:58:21] How are they though?
[1:58:24] Lord,
[1:58:27] father help me.
[1:58:29] She rules him.
[1:58:31] Sure. She rules him. Now you can
[1:58:34] probably well understand what I have
[1:58:37] been hitting it
[1:58:39] by her what?
[1:58:47] Come on. And her what?
[1:58:54] And by what
[1:58:57] this beauty face?
[1:59:00] You follow me?
[1:59:02] The face
[1:59:04] this form
[1:59:06] the rest of the body.
[1:59:10] Amen. By her beauty, by her sex control,
[1:59:15] her shape that was given to her by who?
[1:59:19] So these women are going to control you
[1:59:23] by their beauty.
[1:59:27] They're going to control you by the sex
[1:59:30] control. Because as a daughter of Adam,
[1:59:35] as a as a son of Adam, as a son of
[1:59:38] Israel, you are not equipped enough
[1:59:42] to handle a worldly woman.
[1:59:45] Amen. You are not experienced in sex
[1:59:48] enough to know how to satisfy a woman in
[1:59:53] the world.
[1:59:56] I am talking to this church. Leave me
[1:59:58] alone.
[1:59:58] Amen.
[2:00:00] Are you there? She's controlling by her
[2:00:03] beauty, by her sex, and by the form. If
[2:00:07] you ask a young man, why do you love
[2:00:09] that woman?
[2:00:12] Why do you love that woman? It is not
[2:00:15] because of her character. You fell
[2:00:18] either for beauty or you fell because of
[2:00:22] a shape that look like a Coca-Cola bon
[2:00:26] or you fell because of a sexual desire,
[2:00:30] but you are not equipped enough to
[2:00:34] handle her.
[2:00:39] You are not sufficiently equipped enough
[2:00:43] to handle her young lady. You are not
[2:00:46] sufficient enough to handle a man that
[2:00:50] smoke marijuana
[2:00:52] and that smoke whiskey
[2:00:54] because I prove to you by brother
[2:00:56] Brandham that marijuana and whiskey
[2:00:59] raises the passion of men.
[2:01:01] You're going to have a beast in your
[2:01:03] house
[2:01:04] until he's going to make you do sodomy
[2:01:06] with him.
[2:01:10] Do you follow me?
[2:01:12] Should I repeat again?
[2:01:14] Should I repeat again?
[2:01:15] You are not equipped enough to handle a
[2:01:20] worldly man.
[2:01:22] He is more specialized than you. He's
[2:01:25] going to make you do stuff in the
[2:01:27] bedroom that your mind will be
[2:01:29] perverted.
[2:01:31] Amen.
[2:01:33] Because it's a different kingdom. That's
[2:01:35] why God say don't associate with them.
[2:01:38] They coming from the lineage of Cain.
[2:01:41] They coming from the serpent. They are
[2:01:43] more specialized than you. I don't want
[2:01:46] you to get entangled there.
[2:01:48] That's why when Israel went to all do
[2:01:51] you follow me?
[2:01:52] And bring the women sir.
[2:01:54] Moses got angry. Moses say every woman
[2:01:59] that have been touched by a man kill her
[2:02:02] because you cannot reach her level.
[2:02:06] You can't do it.
[2:02:09] Do you follow me? You cannot reach her
[2:02:12] level.
[2:02:12] Amen. Amen.
[2:02:14] You're going to be tormented
[2:02:16] because she was touched by man that is
[2:02:19] not your caliber.
[2:02:20] Are you there? And you're going to have
[2:02:22] trouble in the marriage.
[2:02:24] Amen. You're going to find trying to do
[2:02:26] this and this and try to get all kind of
[2:02:29] surgery. You don't need surgery.
[2:02:34] You don't need surgery.
[2:02:38] Do you hear me?
[2:02:39] Brother Brandham went to a stadium one
[2:02:42] time.
[2:02:45] I don't know how brother Robert coded
[2:02:47] quickly.
[2:02:48] Brother Brandham went to a s to a
[2:02:50] stadium one time and as he passed down
[2:02:54] he see something written there.
[2:02:57] You think brother Brandham was telling
[2:02:59] stories.
[2:03:00] Brother Brandham say what I saw written
[2:03:04] was saying it is not the size of the dog
[2:03:09] in the fight.
[2:03:13] Do you understand me? But is the size of
[2:03:17] the fight in the dog.
[2:03:22] Do you follow me?
[2:03:23] You don't need any surgery.
[2:03:27] Do you follow me? It is not the size of
[2:03:30] the fight.
[2:03:35] We are dealing with the black dog.
[2:03:37] It is not the size that matter, young
[2:03:40] people.
[2:03:41] It is the fight that matter.
[2:03:46] Do you follow me?
[2:03:48] Can you read me?
[2:03:49] Do you follow me?
[2:03:51] That's why it is wrong for a young man
[2:03:54] to masturbate.
[2:03:58] Do you follow me?
[2:04:00] Because you are training your brain a
[2:04:02] different way.
[2:04:04] Amen.
[2:04:04] You are giving a different timing to
[2:04:07] your brain.
[2:04:08] Yes sir. And when it will come time that
[2:04:10] you are needed, your body is responding
[2:04:14] according to your masturbation. You
[2:04:17] destroy your fight.
[2:04:20] [Applause]
[2:04:22] Hallelujah.
[2:04:23] Do you get me what I'm saying?
[2:04:26] Stop doing what you do in your bedroom.
[2:04:28] Amen.
[2:04:29] Stop doing what you do under your
[2:04:31] blanket.
[2:04:32] Amen.
[2:04:32] Stop doing what you do in your bathroom.
[2:04:35] You are destroying the fight.
[2:04:37] Amen. It is not the size. Brother,
[2:04:41] brother Brandham say that is the paradox
[2:04:43] with Samson. He say that Joe Samson as a
[2:04:47] big man with a muscle. He says Samson
[2:04:49] was not a big man. He was a slain man.
[2:04:53] But the difference with Samson was the
[2:04:56] fighting Samson.
[2:04:58] Do you understand me? That's why David
[2:05:00] said he renew us. He renew our youth
[2:05:04] like a what?
[2:05:08] Hallelujah.
[2:05:09] Do you follow me?
[2:05:11] Do you know what Samson did to the gates
[2:05:13] of Gaza?
[2:05:14] Do you know what he did?
[2:05:16] When the anointing came on him, Samson
[2:05:18] pick up the gate of Gaza. Where did he
[2:05:21] go?
[2:05:25] Where did Samson go?
[2:05:28] He went there was a hill.
[2:05:31] Samson picked up the gate.
[2:05:34] And he went all the way
[2:05:36] and he went all the way to the hill.
[2:05:40] Do you follow me?
[2:05:41] When he reached the hill, what did he
[2:05:43] do?
[2:05:44] He dropped the gate.
[2:05:46] The hill is the highest point,
[2:05:50] which is the climax.
[2:05:57] It's not the size of the dog. It is the
[2:05:59] size of the fight that can take you all
[2:06:02] the way here.
[2:06:03] You not specialize to handle that.
[2:06:06] Stay away.
[2:06:07] I hope you got it.
[2:06:09] By the byproduct that Satan,
[2:06:13] she is sent to deceive sons of God
[2:06:16] and she can sway more of them to hell
[2:06:19] than any other instrument Satan got.
[2:06:24] That's exactly right. I'm talking of
[2:06:26] immoral now.
[2:06:28] Not you sisters.
[2:06:30] We shall give your place right place in
[2:06:33] a few minute in the word of God. Stop
[2:06:37] reading all kind of nonsense.
[2:06:41] Amen.
[2:06:42] Hallelujah.
[2:06:44] Benam teaching
[2:06:46] came down among Israel and they invited
[2:06:50] all the Israelite up to a big feast. The
[2:06:54] big blood they had. Oh, some big party
[2:06:58] sh uh shending of a thing up there they
[2:07:02] had. And when they got up there, these
[2:07:05] Israelite people begin to see these
[2:07:08] pretty how
[2:07:10] sexy
[2:07:11] sexy dressed moabitete women.
[2:07:15] Yes. Was not like the common girls down
[2:07:20] there.
[2:07:21] [Applause]
[2:07:22] There is a difference with a daughter of
[2:07:25] God
[2:07:26] and a daughter of the world.
[2:07:29] Amen.
[2:07:29] Yes, sir.
[2:07:30] Oh, they look so pretty. My how they
[2:07:35] were made the shepherd and how they
[2:07:38] could show themselves and they fell for
[2:07:41] it and begin to commit what
[2:07:45] was in these women that bring a man out
[2:07:49] and the daughter of Israel could not do
[2:07:51] it.
[2:07:53] Just the same as Bum's teaching that he
[2:07:57] calls the pretty intellectual scientific
[2:08:01] women of Moab with their fli
[2:08:05] her
[2:08:07] and pers
[2:08:09] perfume to entice the sons of God
[2:08:13] against their own water
[2:08:16] that worked and had water
[2:08:20] in the water. They are working mothers
[2:08:24] and their hands are hard. Those that are
[2:08:28] that do not work, they don't cook, they
[2:08:31] don't like the kitchen, the hands are
[2:08:34] soft.
[2:08:38] When you compare, you say this one is
[2:08:41] soft.
[2:08:42] Bring air. You're going to eat in a
[2:08:44] restaurant out every day.
[2:08:46] Are you there? with no makeup on ent.
[2:08:52] Let us marry one another because we are
[2:08:54] all the same. What?
[2:08:56] Equal.
[2:08:56] That was a lie.
[2:08:59] It was a lie. An achievement of the
[2:09:03] to get the sons of God to marry the
[2:09:06] daughter of what?
[2:09:07] That's what this anointing is all about.
[2:09:11] Everybody following me so far? The
[2:09:13] second key to Jezebel
[2:09:16] is when Jezebel enter into your life.
[2:09:22] When a young man or a young woman get
[2:09:26] connected to a worldly man or a worldly
[2:09:29] woman, it doesn't stop there.
[2:09:34] Do you follow me? Jezebel has her second
[2:09:38] stage that she takes you into.
[2:09:41] The second stage is she revive the
[2:09:45] pollution that you escape.
[2:09:50] I'm going to explain it together.
[2:09:52] When you start coding a woman of the
[2:09:56] world, automatically it shows you are in
[2:09:59] a backslaving condition.
[2:10:03] Are you there? You are not where you are
[2:10:06] supposed to be with God.
[2:10:08] That's why you get attracted over there.
[2:10:10] And once you get attracted there and you
[2:10:13] start having a relationship with that
[2:10:16] woman,
[2:10:17] you start having a relationship with
[2:10:20] that man, what's going to happen to you
[2:10:22] is everything you did bad in the past
[2:10:26] will be revived again.
[2:10:31] Amen.
[2:10:32] Where do you get that?
[2:10:35] First Kings chapter 16 verse 31. And it
[2:10:39] came to pass as if he had been a light
[2:10:43] thing
[2:10:44] for him Ahab to walk in the sins of
[2:10:47] Gerobam the son of Nebath
[2:10:51] that he took to a wife who
[2:10:53] we in the natural. The daughter of who?
[2:10:57] Eth. Do you see where brother Brandham
[2:10:59] got it?
[2:10:59] Yes.
[2:11:00] King of the what?
[2:11:02] I told you.
[2:11:02] Do you remember? I told you to remember
[2:11:04] Zidonian.
[2:11:05] Yes, sir.
[2:11:06] And went and serve who?
[2:11:09] And worship who?
[2:11:11] So by being John to Jezebel. By default,
[2:11:16] by the laws of God, automatically Ahab
[2:11:19] is going into idolatry.
[2:11:22] Does he stop there? No. Because she's
[2:11:25] controlling you by her beauty,
[2:11:28] by her attractiveness, by her beauty, by
[2:11:31] her sex control, and by the form of her
[2:11:33] body. That's why she must wear tight
[2:11:35] clothes
[2:11:36] to accentuate or to expose her shape.
[2:11:41] When I see her, I'm dead.
[2:11:44] Yeah, you are going to be dead.
[2:11:46] Are you there?
[2:11:48] Worship him. And he will up for who?
[2:11:52] Just like Solomon did,
[2:11:54] built a church for Bale in the house of
[2:11:57] B, which he had built in Samaria.
[2:12:01] And Ahab made a grove. Ahab did more to
[2:12:05] provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger
[2:12:10] than all the kings of Israel that were
[2:12:13] before him.
[2:12:14] Why?
[2:12:17] Why is this woman when she enter into
[2:12:20] you, she make you spit on the prophet?
[2:12:28] Why is this woman when she catches
[2:12:31] somebody,
[2:12:32] she will make that person even curse
[2:12:35] brother Brham?
[2:12:37] You're going to do stuff that even the
[2:12:40] people that were before you could not
[2:12:42] do.
[2:12:46] It is Jezebel.
[2:12:48] In other words, renounce that God.
[2:12:51] Renounce everything.
[2:12:52] Don't go to that church anymore. Don't
[2:12:55] be part of that church anymore.
[2:12:57] If you want to stay with me, if you love
[2:12:59] me, you stay here. I'm not going to your
[2:13:02] church because your preacher is always
[2:13:04] preaching against me.
[2:13:05] Yeah, that's it.
[2:13:08] Watch now. In his what?
[2:13:11] The days of who? Ahab.
[2:13:14] The days of Jezebel. In his day. Because
[2:13:18] Jezebel was the one ruling. In his day
[2:13:22] did Hel the Bethleheat
[2:13:25] built what?
[2:13:30] When Israel was coming from Egypt,
[2:13:35] they first the city of Jericho.
[2:13:38] Yes, sir.
[2:13:38] You follow me?
[2:13:40] Jezebel will revive Jericho.
[2:13:43] Do you understand me? And God told
[2:13:46] Israel, "Destroy everything in Jericho."
[2:13:50] And when they destroy it, uh Joshua came
[2:13:53] and put a curse on the city like nobody
[2:13:56] rebuilt this.
[2:13:57] That's right.
[2:14:01] Let me go here. Indeed, in his day did
[2:14:05] hya the Bethl built Jericho. He laid the
[2:14:09] foundation thereof in Abraham his first
[2:14:12] son. When he laid the foundation, his
[2:14:14] first son died.
[2:14:15] Why?
[2:14:18] And set up the gate thereof in his
[2:14:21] youngest son. He put the gate. His
[2:14:24] youngest son died
[2:14:26] according to the word of the Lord which
[2:14:29] he spake by who?
[2:14:31] Joshua the son of Nana.
[2:14:33] The Holy Spirit type of Joshua.
[2:14:36] And the young men thou spies went in and
[2:14:40] brought out Rahab. Who was Rahab?
[2:14:44] A prostitute. Who was Jezebel?
[2:14:48] Rahab living in Jericho was a prostitute
[2:14:52] until she left Jericho.
[2:14:55] Do you follow me? When she was in
[2:14:57] Jericho, she live as a prostitute. When
[2:15:00] God deliver her, God destroy her past
[2:15:05] completely
[2:15:06] and wipe her record completely
[2:15:10] so that he cannot chase where Herab was.
[2:15:15] Are you there? God wipe everything
[2:15:18] completely. But Jezebel revived Jero
[2:15:23] back again.
[2:15:27] Are you there?
[2:15:28] Her father, her mother, her brethren,
[2:15:31] and all that she had, they brought out
[2:15:34] all her kindred and left them without
[2:15:36] the camp. And they did what?
[2:15:39] They burned the city with what?
[2:15:42] Because the wall was already destroyed
[2:15:44] by God. They burned the city with fire,
[2:15:47] and all that was there in only silver,
[2:15:52] gold, and the vessel of brass and iron,
[2:15:55] the four element of the image of Daniel,
[2:15:58] which is the world.
[2:15:59] Everybody clear?
[2:16:01] They put it in the treasury of the house
[2:16:03] of the Lord. And Joshua saved who?
[2:16:06] The Holy Spirit save her
[2:16:10] out of the hollow house.
[2:16:13] Come on. out of the Jezebel anointing he
[2:16:17] saved her about
[2:16:21] the hall and her father's household
[2:16:25] and all that she had and she dwelt in
[2:16:28] Israel even unto this water she became
[2:16:31] part of Israel just like Ruth
[2:16:34] because she accepted the spies because
[2:16:38] she hid the water
[2:16:41] which Joshua sent to spy to
[2:16:44] Brother Brandham say those two messenger
[2:16:47] play tapes for her.
[2:16:50] Now
[2:16:55] Hallelujah.
[2:16:58] The messenger were human beings
[2:17:02] but brother Brandham said they play
[2:17:04] tapes.
[2:17:05] How did they play tapes?
[2:17:09] The tape become a human being.
[2:17:12] [Music]
[2:17:14] Are you there?
[2:17:15] And when you play a tape, you don't
[2:17:18] change something.
[2:17:19] Yes sir.
[2:17:19] You are only repeating what the tape
[2:17:22] say.
[2:17:23] So it was preacher that swallow the
[2:17:26] message and repeat the message according
[2:17:29] to the way the message was given.
[2:17:32] Yes sir. And Rahab received that
[2:17:35] preaching
[2:17:36] and that preaching loosed her from the
[2:17:39] house of prostitution.
[2:17:41] And Joshua destroyed the city.
[2:17:44] Hallelujah.
[2:17:45] And Joshua adjourned them at that time,
[2:17:47] saying,
[2:17:48] "Cursed be the man before the Lord that
[2:17:52] rise up and built this city of water.
[2:17:55] He shall lay the foundation thereof in
[2:17:58] his firstborn, and his youngest son
[2:18:00] shall he set up the gate." That's why
[2:18:02] that man tried and they killed his
[2:18:04] firstborn and his youngest one. But
[2:18:07] Jericho was revived. What was Jericho?
[2:18:11] Hallelujah. Oh Lord, help me.
[2:18:14] Hallelujah.
[2:18:16] This poor blind man sitting outside of
[2:18:19] the big wicked city. Always was a what?
[2:18:24] A wicked city. As far as I know, still a
[2:18:27] what?
[2:18:28] In the Bible. It is represented as the
[2:18:31] road to what?
[2:18:33] The way of the prostitute in the book of
[2:18:36] proverb was the road to what?
[2:18:43] Jezebel is remove is resurrecting your
[2:18:47] old life that prepare you to go to hell.
[2:18:53] Amen. That's why a brother backsliding.
[2:18:57] When you begin to quote a woman of the
[2:18:59] world, before you know it, you begin to
[2:19:01] drink beer.
[2:19:05] You before you know it, you begin to
[2:19:06] drink wine.
[2:19:07] You're going back to the old life
[2:19:10] because those women will revive the life
[2:19:13] that you left.
[2:19:16] You're going with a man of the world.
[2:19:19] Before you know it, to please him, you
[2:19:21] must put makeup. You must wear high
[2:19:23] heel. You must put sexy dresses because
[2:19:26] that's what pleases him. It was the
[2:19:28] stuff that you left before you going
[2:19:30] back to them.
[2:19:33] Are you there?
[2:19:34] Jerusalem sat on the hill. Jericho sets
[2:19:38] in the valley. And the good Samaritan
[2:19:41] found a man coming from Jerusalem down
[2:19:43] to Jericho. He fell among thieves. Think
[2:19:46] of it. He was what?
[2:19:49] A brother who caught a woman outside is
[2:19:52] a backsliding brother.
[2:19:55] When you see a sister begin to talk to a
[2:19:58] man that is not a message believer, he
[2:20:00] is she's backsliding.
[2:20:02] That's right.
[2:20:03] Coming from the heavenly to the water
[2:20:06] curse. Jericho is a cursed city.
[2:20:10] Jerusalem is a blessed city. He was on
[2:20:13] his road backsleading when he fell among
[2:20:16] thieves and robbers. This is why when
[2:20:19] you take a wrong way, when you begin to
[2:20:21] go down Jericho, when Jero is revived,
[2:20:25] if you had a good credit, your credit
[2:20:27] bad, you begin to get in depth, your
[2:20:29] money begin to go, you begin to lose a
[2:20:31] car, you begin to lose a house. All of
[2:20:33] these things happen with a prostitution
[2:20:35] with women.
[2:20:37] Your record increase, ticket today,
[2:20:39] ticket tomorrow because you are you you
[2:20:41] are falling. You are vulnerable to
[2:20:43] thieves because that's the road to
[2:20:45] Jericho.
[2:20:47] Yes.
[2:20:47] You want to get in trouble, you can come
[2:20:50] back, but your record in the states is
[2:20:52] going to take seven years to clean you
[2:20:54] up.
[2:20:56] Hallelujah. And robbers that strip him.
[2:21:00] And that is when you shall fall among
[2:21:02] thieves and robbers. When you start
[2:21:05] backsliding away from God, just expect
[2:21:08] the enemy to be along the road. Jericho
[2:21:11] was always a cursed city since the Jews
[2:21:14] possessed Palestine. Joshua said, "Curs
[2:21:17] is the man that shall build this city."
[2:21:19] Jericho always represented what?
[2:21:23] Blacksing. Jerusalem set above Jericho,
[2:21:26] the heavenly. And at and as he left
[2:21:30] Jericho going down, you were going away
[2:21:32] from who?
[2:21:34] Jezebel. Revive the escape pollution.
[2:21:37] Everybody clear?
[2:21:38] In Ezekiel 23, we found out a hol. And
[2:21:44] as soon as she saw them with her eyes
[2:21:47] and dotted lusted upon them, she sent
[2:21:51] messenger onto the water. This woman
[2:21:55] begin to love the man of Calin, the man
[2:21:58] of Babylon.
[2:22:00] Right?
[2:22:01] Remember when a Babylonian
[2:22:03] spirit get into you,
[2:22:06] it doesn't stop there.
[2:22:08] When it get into you, it destroy you
[2:22:10] first, then it's going to revive your
[2:22:12] old life.
[2:22:14] These women got a problem in Egypt.
[2:22:18] They lost their virginity in Egypt.
[2:22:20] That's right.
[2:22:20] You remember the story? We already went
[2:22:22] through this. And God rescued them and
[2:22:25] brought them to the promised land. When
[2:22:27] they enter to begin to have a
[2:22:30] relationship with the Babylonian women,
[2:22:33] watch how that spirit of Babylon is
[2:22:36] going to revive the spirit of Egypt.
[2:22:41] And the Babylonian man, the Babylonian
[2:22:44] came to her into the bed of love and
[2:22:47] they defile her with their whoredom and
[2:22:50] she was polluted with them and her mind
[2:22:53] was alienated from them.
[2:22:55] 19 Yet she did what?
[2:22:59] You think she's going to change? No,
[2:23:01] she's just going from one dep of Satan
[2:23:04] to the next one.
[2:23:06] She multiply her wardom in calling to
[2:23:09] water.
[2:23:11] What makes her remember Egypt back?
[2:23:14] Because she got connected to the Babylon
[2:23:17] spirit. They did to her certain things
[2:23:21] that in order to keep that relationship
[2:23:24] in oil change, you need that old life
[2:23:31] in calling to remembrance the days of
[2:23:34] her water
[2:23:35] where she played the water
[2:23:38] in the land of water. A connection with
[2:23:41] Babylonian spirit will always bring your
[2:23:45] past back again to life. Amen.
[2:23:48] That's good.
[2:23:49] Amen.
[2:23:50] Are you there?
[2:23:52] For she dotted upon their params whose
[2:23:55] flesh is as the a flesh of the water
[2:23:58] and whose issue is like the issues of
[2:24:00] water.
[2:24:02] You are not trained young woman. Don't
[2:24:04] go in the world. You're going to meet
[2:24:06] one of these and you're going to get in
[2:24:08] trouble. And furthermore, that she sent
[2:24:11] for men to come from far off unto whom a
[2:24:14] messenger was sent. And they came of
[2:24:17] whom you did wash yourself and painted
[2:24:20] the water. Now to please those men, you
[2:24:23] must put a makeup because they are not
[2:24:25] used to the women of Israel.
[2:24:27] They are used to the women of their
[2:24:29] caliber. You must fit those women to
[2:24:32] please those men. That's why you begin
[2:24:35] to put high heels. That's why you begin
[2:24:37] to put nails. I'm going to get into that
[2:24:39] in a few minutes. Are you there?
[2:24:42] Pet the second.
[2:24:45] I'm still okay. So chill out.
[2:24:48] Don't put pressure. We okay. So when
[2:24:51] they speak great swelling word this
[2:24:53] preacher of vanity they alo
[2:24:58] they seduce
[2:25:00] through the lust of the flesh. This
[2:25:02] preacher through much wantedness
[2:25:05] those that were what?
[2:25:08] Clean escape from them who who live in
[2:25:12] what?
[2:25:13] This kind of anointing when it comes and
[2:25:18] touch a preacher,
[2:25:20] follow me very carefully.
[2:25:21] It will make that preacher begin to
[2:25:25] preach through your lust.
[2:25:28] You follow me?
[2:25:29] And then begin to bring you back again
[2:25:33] to the life that you already escape.
[2:25:38] Let me go slowly.
[2:25:39] While they promised them what?
[2:25:43] That preacher will begin to tell you
[2:25:46] that I want to free the woman from
[2:25:48] bondage.
[2:25:54] I want to give the women in the message
[2:25:56] liberty.
[2:25:58] It's in the scripture.
[2:26:00] It's in the scripture. I want to give I
[2:26:03] want to promise liberty to the women. We
[2:26:06] have been so tight to the women. We mean
[2:26:08] to free the women.
[2:26:10] It is the Babylonian spirit that enter
[2:26:13] in and want to revive back the things
[2:26:18] that you left.
[2:26:19] Because before you came to the message,
[2:26:22] you were wearing high heel. You were
[2:26:24] wearing earring. You were painting your
[2:26:26] faces. You were wearing all the pants.
[2:26:30] You were wearing mini skirt. When you
[2:26:32] came in the message, you were free from
[2:26:35] that one. But when a preacher backslid,
[2:26:39] that anointing will begin to want to
[2:26:41] give you a liberty. Not truly a liberty,
[2:26:45] but to bring you back again to where you
[2:26:48] came from.
[2:26:49] Because who the son has free is free
[2:26:52] indeed. They free you from pagan not to
[2:26:55] free you to go back to pagan.
[2:26:58] Amen.
[2:27:00] Brother, brother,
[2:27:01] here was one of our Christian sister
[2:27:05] painted up like a water.
[2:27:08] I said, "What's the mother?"
[2:27:10] She said, "Well, glory to God." My who
[2:27:15] told me it was a what?
[2:27:23] Sister were not putting makeup. They
[2:27:25] begin to put the makeup. Why did you
[2:27:28] change sister? My pastor is liberating
[2:27:31] women. You are not wearing pent. Why are
[2:27:34] you wearing pent again? My pastor say he
[2:27:36] was okay
[2:27:37] promising you liberation but actually
[2:27:41] bringing you back again the old life.
[2:27:44] It's a Jezebel spirit.
[2:27:46] Liberation of women. What's the matter
[2:27:49] with you? No such a thing as that.
[2:27:52] Christ liberated you from what? Christ
[2:27:56] destroy your Jericho.
[2:27:59] What kind of freedom do you want again?
[2:28:05] Christ liberated you from sin.
[2:28:07] Then act like it, dress like it.
[2:28:11] About time the church get built up and
[2:28:14] get a good start, then something like
[2:28:16] that set in. In the time we think
[2:28:19] message believer are already on the top,
[2:28:22] something like this start back up. Amen.
[2:28:25] She said, "Well, I tell you, my pastor
[2:28:28] told me I could do all of this
[2:28:30] and had enough paint on to paint a barn.
[2:28:33] Her fingers look like she has been
[2:28:36] eating raw beef steak
[2:28:38] and blood over her water."
[2:28:41] She painted her long fingernails. I
[2:28:44] thought, "Woman, you don't look like a
[2:28:47] Christian to me." Listen lady, don't you
[2:28:50] let that kind of nonsense be poured down
[2:28:54] your throat. A good old fashioned case
[2:28:57] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost will do
[2:29:00] what?
[2:29:01] Take that out.
[2:29:03] Take that out of you. Just exactly.
[2:29:07] Remember, you lost some ground
[2:29:09] somewhere.
[2:29:10] When you are finding yourself into
[2:29:12] something like that, you losing ground.
[2:29:15] Do you follow me? Now Peter continue
[2:29:18] while they promise liberty they
[2:29:21] themselves are servant of corruption
[2:29:24] for of whom a man is overcome of the
[2:29:27] same is he brought to order it he it
[2:29:29] shows that the preacher has been taken
[2:29:31] over by a spirit
[2:29:34] for if after they have escaped the
[2:29:37] pollution of the world
[2:29:39] through the water
[2:29:41] the knowledge of the Lord and savior
[2:29:43] water
[2:29:44] God came and free you from Jericho
[2:29:47] free you from the world. You already
[2:29:49] escaped the pollution. You already
[2:29:51] destroy your Jericho.
[2:29:54] They are again entangled there in
[2:29:57] overcome the latter end is worth with
[2:30:01] them than what
[2:30:03] somebody who does that is hard for you
[2:30:05] to win and back again.
[2:30:07] Don't waste your time.
[2:30:08] They're not going to listen to you. For
[2:30:10] if they for it had been better for them
[2:30:14] not to have known the way of
[2:30:17] righteousness,
[2:30:18] it was good for them not to be part of
[2:30:20] the message.
[2:30:23] Then you have a chance.
[2:30:25] Then after they have known it to turn
[2:30:29] from the holy commandment, deliver unto
[2:30:32] them. But it is happen unto them
[2:30:35] according to the true proverb. They are
[2:30:37] fulfilling the word. The dog, the black
[2:30:40] dog is turned to his own
[2:30:44] and they saw to that was washed her to
[2:30:48] her wallowing into the water.
[2:30:50] The one who reactivate that is Jezebel.
[2:30:54] Everybody clear? The third one,
[2:30:58] Jezebel bring hiddenism
[2:31:03] and paganism to your new Christianity
[2:31:07] lifestyle.
[2:31:11] 2 Kings chapter 9:30. And when Ju was
[2:31:15] come to Jezrael, Jezebel heard of it,
[2:31:19] and she did what?
[2:31:23] Hallelujah.
[2:31:25] Three things she did in the scripture.
[2:31:28] Number one, she did what?
[2:31:30] She painted her face. Why does she
[2:31:33] painted her face? They control by
[2:31:35] beauty. face by sex control and by the
[2:31:39] form. She painted her face. Come on. She
[2:31:42] did what?
[2:31:44] Which brother Brandham explained that
[2:31:46] it's cutting her hair.
[2:31:48] Why do you leave the message? You start
[2:31:50] cutting hair.
[2:31:53] What is the cutting hair doing?
[2:31:57] It's making you sexy. And look out at
[2:32:00] the water.
[2:32:02] Look out at the window.
[2:32:06] Hallelujah.
[2:32:08] This window, can I raise this? This
[2:32:12] window,
[2:32:13] this is the house of Jezebel, her
[2:32:16] palace. Everybody clear? There is a
[2:32:19] window.
[2:32:20] Do you follow me?
[2:32:22] Jezebel is here.
[2:32:25] Amen. She never went to the window.
[2:32:30] Only after she did something.
[2:32:38] Do you follow me?
[2:32:40] The only time she appear
[2:32:43] on the window
[2:32:45] on the internet window.
[2:32:53] It's in your scripture.
[2:32:56] Is after she painted her face
[2:33:00] and she cut her hair. After she fix
[2:33:03] herself up, that's when she take a
[2:33:07] picture to post.
[2:33:12] She never post when she's natural.
[2:33:16] She always post when she have big
[2:33:20] glasses. She fix her hair a certain way.
[2:33:23] Then you see a sister.
[2:33:27] That's right.
[2:33:28] Why you didn't post before?
[2:33:32] That's it.
[2:33:34] If she doesn't look good enough, she's
[2:33:36] going to airbrushing.
[2:33:38] That airbrushing is like a notificial
[2:33:42] makeup to give you an appearance you
[2:33:45] don't have naturally
[2:33:47] to post on the window.
[2:33:49] It is an anointing of Jezebel.
[2:33:54] You will hate me. You will love me in
[2:33:56] heaven. Yes.
[2:33:58] This is the territory of Jezebel.
[2:34:02] Number one, she painted her faces.
[2:34:06] William Marion Brham. Oh, you old rock
[2:34:09] and roll and boogie woogie. Where did he
[2:34:12] come from? Somebody say, "Preach on the
[2:34:15] black dog and music." Out of the heart
[2:34:18] of Africa.
[2:34:20] I just left Africa. You young women with
[2:34:24] that penton. You know where he came
[2:34:26] from. That is a mark of what?
[2:34:29] Hiddenism.
[2:34:34] Everybody clear.
[2:34:36] It is a mark of hiddenism. They paint
[2:34:40] their face. That is where you get it
[2:34:43] from. Hidden doesn't Christian wash
[2:34:46] their face. Amen. That's right. That
[2:34:48] they must scorch a little brother. That
[2:34:50] must scorch a little kind of kind of
[2:34:53] scorch a little brother. You better be
[2:34:55] scorched here than burn somewhere else.
[2:34:58] Brother Brham say the reason why if you
[2:35:01] need the code to see me that they pent
[2:35:03] their face the painting of their face
[2:35:06] was an act of worship to their god. They
[2:35:10] were doing that to worship their god.
[2:35:16] Oh and I don't blame many women to look
[2:35:20] your best or whatever. be clean and lady
[2:35:24] that's all right but I just hate to see
[2:35:27] somebody disfigure themsel these women
[2:35:31] don't even look like human
[2:35:33] but look clean be like a lady and men
[2:35:36] don't be sloppy
[2:35:38] that is not humble
[2:35:40] wearing all kind of clothes I'm just a
[2:35:42] humble
[2:35:44] no sir
[2:35:45] go get a suit
[2:35:48] don't try to do things like that just Be
[2:35:51] an ordinary brother. You see, and just
[2:35:54] be yourself. I hate to see anybody
[2:35:58] trying to put on something they are
[2:36:00] really not.
[2:36:01] The picture people post on the Facebook,
[2:36:05] you must see them bright. The day you
[2:36:07] see the person, she's not bright.
[2:36:09] That's right.
[2:36:10] Because they remove all the stuff that
[2:36:12] they have
[2:36:13] to appear on the window
[2:36:16] to please people.
[2:36:18] Are you there? the territory of Jezebel.
[2:36:22] The nails, you ready?
[2:36:26] We talk about the nails with
[2:36:27] Nebuchadnezzar
[2:36:29] in the book of Daniel.
[2:36:31] Brother Brandham say now there is a
[2:36:33] place when you get this amnesia. You
[2:36:36] already left the word. You might get
[2:36:38] like Nebuchadnezzar
[2:36:40] who exalted himself one time and God let
[2:36:44] him think he was a what?
[2:36:47] An animal. He lived out in the
[2:36:49] wilderness and ate grass like an ox. His
[2:36:53] hair grown down his body like eagle
[2:36:55] feathers. Those those haircut you see
[2:36:58] young men African-American have they
[2:37:01] don't want to comb the hair. He had
[2:37:03] become the heart of a beast. That was
[2:37:06] amnesia because he had forgotten that he
[2:37:09] was a king. He had forgotten that he was
[2:37:12] a what?
[2:37:13] A human being. And he thought he was an
[2:37:15] animal. So he acted like an animal
[2:37:18] because she forgot she was a water.
[2:37:22] That's what make her grow her nail.
[2:37:25] Let's continue. Brother Stevening
[2:37:29] spirit. Me
[2:37:32] I went to church. Nebuchadnezzar was a
[2:37:34] great man. But because he got holy, God
[2:37:38] give him the spirit of Phox and let him
[2:37:41] eat grass for seven years. And his what?
[2:37:46] fingernails grow out like some of these
[2:37:48] what
[2:37:50] women do around here. That is what and
[2:37:53] he got demon what
[2:37:55] a man in the Bible made his finger grow
[2:37:59] because of a demonic
[2:38:02] possession.
[2:38:05] Do you follow me?
[2:38:07] We are not only engaged but we are
[2:38:11] married. The church is married to
[2:38:13] Christ. We are the wife of Christ being
[2:38:15] reinforced children. How would you like
[2:38:18] to come home for a night for your
[2:38:20] devotion to your wife? And she's got a
[2:38:22] bunch of little children. You find that
[2:38:25] when she comes in her nail may be
[2:38:27] painted. That is if you are of the what?
[2:38:34] Everybody clear?
[2:38:38] Deuteronomy 21 sees among the captive.
[2:38:42] God told Israel,
[2:38:44] if you go to war and you win a country
[2:38:48] and you bring captive and those captive
[2:38:51] are women,
[2:38:52] number one, you only marry those that
[2:38:54] were virgin.
[2:38:55] That's right.
[2:38:56] I can show you the scripture. You see
[2:38:57] me? Everybody that was not virgin, you
[2:38:59] kill them.
[2:39:00] That's what God say.
[2:39:01] Marry the virgin. But you don't just get
[2:39:04] that virgin and bring her in.
[2:39:06] Do you follow me? You don't just get Rof
[2:39:09] and bring her in. Ruth must go through
[2:39:11] the process. She must forsake her God,
[2:39:15] her country, her people, her land,
[2:39:18] everything must be forsaken. Then she's
[2:39:21] part of you.
[2:39:22] God say if you find among the captive a
[2:39:25] beautiful woman
[2:39:27] and has a desire unto her that thou west
[2:39:31] have her to a wife, then you shall bring
[2:39:35] her home to thy house.
[2:39:38] That's it. No. And she shall do what?
[2:39:44] A shaving of a woman hair. Meaning she's
[2:39:48] refusing the first headship she has.
[2:39:53] Do you follow me? That's why Ruth say
[2:39:56] your God must be my God.
[2:39:59] I'm renouncing the first headship that I
[2:40:02] have.
[2:40:02] I am taking that off. I am becoming part
[2:40:06] of Israel.
[2:40:07] Don't stop there. We need more clean up.
[2:40:10] What is the next clean up and and pale
[2:40:13] her what?
[2:40:15] Trim her nail.
[2:40:18] I'm bringing you the scripture.
[2:40:21] So you don't say it's a law. Are you
[2:40:23] there?
[2:40:23] Amen.
[2:40:24] Because the pairing of nail the nail the
[2:40:28] women that were having long nails were
[2:40:31] the women of the pagan the Canaanite.
[2:40:35] So when you enter the congregation of
[2:40:38] Israel, cut off, remove those nails.
[2:40:44] And she shall put the remnant of her
[2:40:48] captivity from what?
[2:40:50] Those dirty clothes that held you
[2:40:53] captive. You must take them off. You
[2:40:56] must change your apparel.
[2:40:57] You must change your attire.
[2:40:59] Are you there? and shall remain in thy
[2:41:03] house to do what?
[2:41:06] To be well her who
[2:41:08] and her
[2:41:10] for what? She just have to think a
[2:41:15] separation
[2:41:16] that her father and her mother are dead.
[2:41:20] In other words, her birth is destroyed.
[2:41:23] She's born again.
[2:41:26] Her natural birth is destroyed.
[2:41:28] Wow.
[2:41:30] Are you following me?
[2:41:31] Remove your hair.
[2:41:34] Remove your nails.
[2:41:37] Remove change your way of dressing.
[2:41:40] And then renounce to your first birth.
[2:41:43] Are you there? And after that, you shall
[2:41:46] go into her and be a husband
[2:41:48] and she shall be your wife.
[2:41:50] If not, don't get there.
[2:41:53] The process of Ruth,
[2:41:56] brother Stephen, I'm not doing this.
[2:42:00] This is not what I'm doing.
[2:42:03] This is what I'm doing. Message
[2:42:05] believers, many of them. It is a clear
[2:42:08] coat.
[2:42:10] I'm not getting long hair. I'm just
[2:42:12] doing small nail like this.
[2:42:16] Get the marriage picture of message
[2:42:18] believer.
[2:42:19] Watch all of this.
[2:42:22] I didn't put a red color. I didn't put a
[2:42:25] green color. I didn't put a pink color.
[2:42:27] I just make a clear quote and just a
[2:42:30] little bit longer, not too long,
[2:42:39] the territory of the black dog,
[2:42:42] brother Brham, the spirit that went out
[2:42:46] of that man that drove him like a maniac
[2:42:50] does the same thing today in people.
[2:42:54] It is them spirit thousand times
[2:42:58] thousand.
[2:42:59] The devil comes in with just a little
[2:43:03] opium.
[2:43:06] You follow me?
[2:43:07] If you're sleeping, wake up.
[2:43:09] You follow me?
[2:43:11] It is just like they take a little
[2:43:15] school girl. The first thing they will
[2:43:18] do is get her smoke a
[2:43:20] cigarette.
[2:43:22] They don't give you marijuana.
[2:43:25] Not yet. See, they get her what
[2:43:29] and the next things they do, they shall
[2:43:31] get her a little water.
[2:43:34] Next step. And then the first thing he
[2:43:37] ends up into water
[2:43:39] and then from them into the water.
[2:43:43] What does he do? He drive them insane.
[2:43:46] Just go crazy and the devil guts them.
[2:43:51] What are you saying brother Steven?
[2:43:53] The devil is in smoking cigarette.
[2:43:58] That is his leader.
[2:44:01] Can you read it again?
[2:44:04] M form
[2:44:05] cigarette.
[2:44:06] Cigarette.
[2:44:07] Now if he sees you are pretty smart and
[2:44:12] going to catch that, he shall never let
[2:44:16] it go any further than what?
[2:44:18] Cigarettes.
[2:44:22] If the devil God say catch your nail
[2:44:27] you following me
[2:44:28] and the devil make you think like I'm
[2:44:31] not painting them red I'm just putting a
[2:44:34] clear coat I'm not just growing them
[2:44:36] longer I'm just growing them a little
[2:44:38] bit brother Brandham say it's a mild
[2:44:41] form if he understand that if I push her
[2:44:45] to putting red she will catch up that
[2:44:49] I'm going under a demon. He will let you
[2:44:52] there
[2:44:53] and never let you move to the next
[2:44:55] thing.
[2:44:55] That's why you sister are bound by this
[2:44:58] spirit.
[2:44:59] You can't progress. If somebody tells
[2:45:01] you, "No, no, no. I didn't put any P."
[2:45:03] It's the devil holding you there.
[2:45:05] Why did he keep you on the mouth form?
[2:45:07] Because he knows you pretty smart
[2:45:09] enough. You're going to catch him. But
[2:45:11] what is that mouth for going to do?
[2:45:16] If he sees you are pretty smart and
[2:45:19] going to catch that, he shall never let
[2:45:22] it go any further than cigarette. See,
[2:45:24] as long as he can just hold you dead
[2:45:28] long enough till he can take get your
[2:45:31] life snap out. That's it.
[2:45:33] Don't think because your nail are short,
[2:45:36] because you putting a clear pant,
[2:45:39] you're going to be all right.
[2:45:40] You're already against the word of God.
[2:45:43] And that's why you struggle.
[2:45:45] That's why you have problem. That's why
[2:45:47] you have difficulty because something is
[2:45:49] holding you. The devil doesn't want to
[2:45:51] get you to the next step
[2:45:53] because you're going to wake up.
[2:45:55] Yes, sir.
[2:45:57] That's why you have all of this
[2:45:59] in the message.
[2:46:01] And you paying money to go do this.
[2:46:04] Come on.
[2:46:07] Hallelujah.
[2:46:09] Another territory
[2:46:11] of the black dog, the earring.
[2:46:14] Let me look at the time.
[2:46:18] Yeah, I got to stop. Let me finish by
[2:46:20] this. Hallelujah. The earring. Why is
[2:46:23] hearing wrong?
[2:46:26] Genesis chapter 35. And God say unto
[2:46:30] Jacob, Arise, go up to who?
[2:46:34] And dwell there, and make there an altar
[2:46:37] unto God, that appear unto thee, when
[2:46:40] thou fled from the face of Esau, thy
[2:46:42] brother. And Jacob say unto his
[2:46:45] household, and to all that were with
[2:46:48] him, Put away the what?
[2:46:50] God. Jacob in his own house has strange
[2:46:54] God.
[2:46:56] Question, where did those strange god
[2:46:58] come from? From Jacob or from the wives?
[2:47:05] Can you answer?
[2:47:08] Who was hiding?
[2:47:10] Who was hiding the gods?
[2:47:15] Do you see?
[2:47:16] Yes, sir.
[2:47:17] Jacob go there get a wife. But as he's
[2:47:21] bringing Rachel back, Rachel is hiding
[2:47:25] stole the idol of her father. What love
[2:47:28] has Joe have Rachel to the adults? Not
[2:47:32] her adult, the adult of her father. She
[2:47:34] picked it up and hide it. His father
[2:47:37] came to take ad away, but she keep
[2:47:40] holding
[2:47:42] and lied. Want to get with Ador to the
[2:47:45] promised land.
[2:47:49] That's right.
[2:47:50] Are you there?
[2:47:51] In the scripture,
[2:47:53] Jacob said unto his household, to all
[2:47:56] that were with him, put away the what?
[2:47:58] God,
[2:47:59] the strange god that are among you, and
[2:48:01] be what?
[2:48:02] Those gods have a spirit of uncleanness.
[2:48:05] Amen.
[2:48:06] Are you there?
[2:48:07] And change your water.
[2:48:09] Remember the woman that you get captive,
[2:48:12] she must remove her garment of
[2:48:14] captivity. She must trim. She must cut
[2:48:16] her hair completely to show that she's
[2:48:19] under a different headship. And then she
[2:48:21] must be well, refuse her birth, natural
[2:48:25] birth,
[2:48:26] and be born again. Are you there?
[2:48:28] Who answer? Oh, right here. And be clean
[2:48:31] and change your garment and let us arise
[2:48:35] and go up to water.
[2:48:37] In other words, we cannot go to Bethl,
[2:48:39] brother Caleb.
[2:48:41] We cannot go to the house of God.
[2:48:45] We cannot go to that temple
[2:48:48] without me cleaning you up,
[2:48:52] Jesus.
[2:48:53] Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[2:48:55] You cannot enter into the house
[2:48:58] until I clean up the strange God from
[2:49:01] you.
[2:49:02] I clean up the wrong dresses from you.
[2:49:05] I clean up the all the uncleanness, the
[2:49:08] pollution from you.
[2:49:09] I want you get clean up
[2:49:12] before I put you in the house.
[2:49:15] Let us arise and go up to bed. I'm going
[2:49:18] to the airport. This was my first stop.
[2:49:22] And it worked. And I will make thee an
[2:49:24] altar unto God. Who answered me in the
[2:49:27] day of my distress? And who was with me
[2:49:29] in the day which I went? And they gave
[2:49:32] unto Jacob all the water
[2:49:35] which they were in the hand and all the
[2:49:38] water
[2:49:39] stop. Did Jacob told them to give them
[2:49:41] the earring?
[2:49:42] No. Why did they give the earring with
[2:49:44] the god?
[2:49:47] Why did they accompany their god with
[2:49:49] the earring? Why did they connect the
[2:49:52] god with the earring? Why did they
[2:49:55] couple the god with the hearing?
[2:49:57] It goes together.
[2:49:59] It's for the worship of hidden.
[2:50:04] Hallelujah. Oh strange god which were in
[2:50:07] the hand and all the earring which were
[2:50:10] in the what? And Jacob hid them under
[2:50:13] the oak which is shaken. If you follow
[2:50:17] the next verse, the Bible says the fear
[2:50:19] of the Lord came and begin to protect
[2:50:21] Jacob.
[2:50:22] That's it.
[2:50:24] Are you there,
[2:50:26] brother Brandham? I can prove to you
[2:50:29] that come from the devil. I can prove
[2:50:32] you that nothing in it. The originate of
[2:50:35] it was what?
[2:50:37] And as long as you wear it, it's a mark
[2:50:39] of water.
[2:50:41] Now I just came back from Africa. I have
[2:50:44] been in the hotels jungle and found out
[2:50:47] exactly where what
[2:50:50] did brother Brandham give you a
[2:50:51] scripture?
[2:50:53] Brother Brandham connect earring with
[2:50:55] the God of the hidden
[2:50:56] and in the scripture Jacob shows you
[2:50:59] earring connect with the gods.
[2:51:02] Why you don't wear earring in a message?
[2:51:04] Not because it's a law
[2:51:06] because it's a pagan worship.
[2:51:08] Why you don't wear makeup? because it's
[2:51:10] a pagan worship. Why you don't wear high
[2:51:13] heels? I will get to that not today. Are
[2:51:16] you there? And all that stuff come a lot
[2:51:20] of water.
[2:51:22] That's why when you give your wife, it's
[2:51:24] going to be simple.
[2:51:25] Not a lot of water because you're going
[2:51:28] back again to water. Glory to God.
[2:51:34] A lot of Jews wrap around your neck and
[2:51:37] ears and everything. Where that come
[2:51:39] from? It is the what?
[2:51:41] And the Bible don't want a Christian to
[2:51:44] be a what?
[2:51:47] I don't say that you are hidden because
[2:51:49] you do it. But you are making yourself
[2:51:52] look like one,
[2:51:53] a woman with the attire of a harlot.
[2:51:58] It's because your pastor didn't tell you
[2:52:01] the truth.
[2:52:03] The Bible said,
[2:52:05] where is the scripture, brother
[2:52:06] Brandham?
[2:52:08] Did he lie?
[2:52:09] No sir.
[2:52:10] Did he lie?
[2:52:11] No sir.
[2:52:12] If she has not got any fingernails,
[2:52:16] you who let your fingernail grow because
[2:52:18] you don't have it.
[2:52:20] Come on.
[2:52:21] God already gave you
[2:52:23] the God of variety.
[2:52:25] He made you wonderful, beautiful just
[2:52:27] the way he wanted to.
[2:52:30] Are you there?
[2:52:31] And want to put someone if she has not
[2:52:34] got any teeth, you already got them. and
[2:52:37] need some have not got any arm and you
[2:52:40] need one. Have not got any hair hair and
[2:52:43] you need one. We already went with the
[2:52:44] hair. You have not got any those things
[2:52:46] that's different. But when you pull out
[2:52:48] the real good teeth
[2:52:50] because they are just not as bright as
[2:52:52] they should be, then you done wrong. If
[2:52:54] you got red hair and you want black and
[2:52:58] you go down here and color it black just
[2:53:00] because you done wrong.
[2:53:03] I think so. There is no scripture for
[2:53:05] that. only bob hair.
[2:53:08] Hallelujah.
[2:53:09] Amen.
[2:53:10] Let me finish it. If you didn't have any
[2:53:12] hair, you wanted to wear some hair and
[2:53:15] be all right, but wear one that look
[2:53:17] like
[2:53:18] human.
[2:53:20] If you didn't have any fingernails and
[2:53:23] want to get some fingernail, don't get
[2:53:25] them like what?
[2:53:27] Horse of a navy beans. Get real
[2:53:30] fingernail. If you have not got any of
[2:53:32] those things, who doesn't have
[2:53:34] fingernails here?
[2:53:36] Everybody have them. What else do you
[2:53:38] need?
[2:53:40] What else do you need? If you have not
[2:53:43] got any teeth, get you some that make
[2:53:45] you that make you some. Get them. But
[2:53:47] don't pull your God-given teeth just
[2:53:50] because they are little crooked and they
[2:53:52] are good teeth to get some. Don't dye
[2:53:54] your hair or something look like
[2:53:56] something that come out of a meer
[2:53:58] somewhere. If you are colorless, you
[2:54:00] want to make yourself look like you got
[2:54:02] some color. It's all right. I imagine.
[2:54:04] But don't make yourself look like a
[2:54:08] Don't make yourself look like a
[2:54:11] physical. Don't make yourself look like
[2:54:13] a
[2:54:14] like a born somewhere being what?
[2:54:18] Hallelujah. Any people that is really
[2:54:22] wanting to find God, they won't let no
[2:54:24] church dictate to them the things that
[2:54:27] they can't leave.
[2:54:28] That or the other. If you got the nature
[2:54:31] of God in you, you shall go to what?
[2:54:35] You shall go to the right thing. You
[2:54:37] shall stand for the right thing. You
[2:54:39] shall do the right thing. You shall
[2:54:41] think the right thing. You shall live
[2:54:43] the right thing.
[2:54:44] If you are a duck, you like water. If
[2:54:46] you are a Christian, you like Christ. If
[2:54:49] you are devil, you like the things of
[2:54:51] the devil. If you are bazard, you eat
[2:54:53] the dead things. If you are a pig, you
[2:54:55] eat manure. Where you are today, you
[2:54:58] claiming to be up there eating the
[2:55:00] things of the Lord. Then go down at the
[2:55:03] root with the devil. There is something
[2:55:05] wrong with it. Quit listening to them
[2:55:07] spirit. They are devil. No matter if you
[2:55:10] have to stand alone, my sister. Men and
[2:55:14] women that ever amounted to anything
[2:55:17] nearly had to be men and women who stood
[2:55:21] alone with who?
[2:55:25] Amen.
[2:55:27] Let's stand.
[2:55:31] [Applause]
[2:55:37] I'm sorry. I promise I can get to high
[2:55:40] heel. It says it's in the next stage,
[2:55:42] but I can't get no more. We need to stop
[2:55:45] here. We need to pick it up again. What
[2:55:48] is the take-h home message? You are sons
[2:55:51] and daughters of Abraham.
[2:55:54] You are sons and daughter of the end
[2:55:57] time bride that has been redeemed by the
[2:56:00] end time message. That message came to
[2:56:03] clean you up from paganism,
[2:56:06] from hedenism,
[2:56:07] from unbelieving, from all these
[2:56:10] lifestyle that we had. And God don't
[2:56:13] want you to go back again to that same
[2:56:16] lifestyle. You want to get married, pray
[2:56:20] for God to give you a Christian woman
[2:56:22] that look like a Christian. You want to
[2:56:24] pray, get married, pray for God to give
[2:56:27] you a godly young man that looks like a
[2:56:30] godly young man. But don't go and mix
[2:56:33] yourself into a fellowship, a communion,
[2:56:35] an agreement, into marriages with
[2:56:38] strange women.
[2:56:39] You're not going to be able to control
[2:56:41] them. They're going to control you by
[2:56:43] the beauty, by the sex, and by the form.
[2:56:47] Don't think you can go get any kind of
[2:56:49] man up there and bring it here. sister,
[2:56:52] you're not going to be able to control
[2:56:53] them. I know a sister, the parents said
[2:56:56] no, no, no, no, no, no, no. She refused.
[2:57:01] She got married. The man got into the
[2:57:04] message and struggle with women for
[2:57:07] years.
[2:57:09] Amen.
[2:57:09] Amen.
[2:57:10] Today they both divorce.
[2:57:13] The woman is out back. The man is out in
[2:57:17] his own way. The children backslid.
[2:57:20] If that woman would have listened to her
[2:57:23] father 30 years ago, she would not be
[2:57:26] into the same situation. She thought she
[2:57:29] can handle that man. You cannot handle
[2:57:32] that man. That man was going on with
[2:57:34] women while being married.
[2:57:36] You want a man that's going to stay at
[2:57:38] home, seek for a son of God.
[2:57:41] Those up there, you're not going to fit
[2:57:43] them.
[2:57:44] You're not going to be to their level.
[2:57:46] You're not going to satisfy their
[2:57:47] passion because the fools of devils
[2:57:50] until they get clean up from the devil.
[2:57:53] Then it's a different story. But don't
[2:57:55] put yourself into a risk. Some people
[2:57:57] was in the world, they came into the
[2:57:59] message. That's a different story. You
[2:58:01] are born in a message already. Stay
[2:58:04] away. Amen.
[2:58:06] You who are under makeup, under all this
[2:58:09] kind of things and nail and things,
[2:58:11] those that are online, just remember it
[2:58:14] is not against brother Steven. It is
[2:58:16] against the word. God doesn't want any
[2:58:19] trait, any attire of hidden women.
[2:58:24] It is God against hedaism. all these
[2:58:27] things, Christmas, all these uh uh uh
[2:58:31] what uh uh Passover, Easter stuff,
[2:58:34] pagan
[2:58:36] because Jezebel bring paganism into
[2:58:39] Christianity. Mix it together. When you
[2:58:42] swallow that pretty good, they're going
[2:58:44] to revive your old life and you find
[2:58:47] yourself back again backsliding. Let's
[2:58:49] pray. Heavenly Father,
[2:58:51] Lord, we thank you again for your grace,
[2:58:53] for your love, and your mercy. Father,
[2:58:56] like the house of Jacob who you gave a
[2:58:59] commandment to go back to the promised
[2:59:01] land in order to build you a house.
[2:59:04] Father, they could not go back to the
[2:59:06] promised land. They could not build that
[2:59:08] altar of beta which was the house of God
[2:59:12] until Lord the things that was in the
[2:59:14] camp got clean up.
[2:59:16] Lord, you took me down this road and we
[2:59:20] went all the way down deep. what I
[2:59:23] usually refer to the deep the midlife
[2:59:25] zone of the ocean into the territory of
[2:59:28] the black dog just to clean up the life
[2:59:31] of your children to remove all kind of
[2:59:34] nonsense that was read on the on the
[2:59:37] magazine on the internet about having
[2:59:40] sizes having this or getting two surgery
[2:59:43] you must boost your breast all this kind
[2:59:45] of stuff it is to please the men of the
[2:59:48] world
[2:59:48] we don't need no surgery we don't need
[2:59:51] anything all we need is to be connected
[2:59:53] with you Christ.
[2:59:55] Father we preach there is a lot of
[2:59:57] material have been delivered but may the
[2:59:59] Holy Spirit continue to work Lord and to
[3:00:02] unfold to give revelation and to free
[3:00:05] your children.
[3:00:06] Father if there is any on the internet
[3:00:09] any that is present here any that is
[3:00:11] streaming Lord that think that they have
[3:00:14] a right to continue to do what they're
[3:00:15] doing. Father, may you be merciful to
[3:00:18] them because we just present to them the
[3:00:20] word and now they are duty bound either
[3:00:23] to accept it or to reject it. But
[3:00:26] Father, may you give grace enough Lord
[3:00:28] that every rebellion, every spirit,
[3:00:31] every love of the world that is helping
[3:00:33] that is binding them to be cling to
[3:00:36] those things may be completely taken
[3:00:38] away. May father they go to that step
[3:00:41] where Ruth reach Lord where she renounce
[3:00:43] the God of Moab. She renounced her
[3:00:46] country. She renounced who she was. She
[3:00:49] renounced her citizenship. She renounced
[3:00:51] her God. She renounced everything. And
[3:00:54] she was willing to go the extra mile to
[3:00:57] be part of the commonwealth of Israel.
[3:00:59] Father, we come from different ways of
[3:01:02] life, Lord. We come from different
[3:01:03] continent. We come from different
[3:01:05] background, Lord. Father, but may we
[3:01:07] understand that we have been called to
[3:01:09] be daughters and sons of God. May we
[3:01:12] renounce all our country, all our
[3:01:14] custom, all our habit, all our all our
[3:01:18] citizenship. But father, may we come
[3:01:20] under the citizenship of the Holy
[3:01:23] Spirit, Lord, under the headship of the
[3:01:25] word so that over there we all can look
[3:01:28] like your son and your daughter. Father,
[3:01:30] may you touch the young people. May you
[3:01:32] touch the adult, Lord. May you touch the
[3:01:35] sick among us. May you heal them
[3:01:37] completely. Lord, may you deliver those
[3:01:39] that has been bound by this demon, this
[3:01:42] spirit, Lord, that is blocking them,
[3:01:44] Lord. Father, Lord Jesus Christ, this
[3:01:47] seducing spirit that is blocking them
[3:01:49] into the nails, into the painting, into
[3:01:52] the hearing, into the things of the
[3:01:54] word. Father, may you deliver them,
[3:01:56] Lord, completely from that bondage, from
[3:01:59] the lands of the hidden in the name of
