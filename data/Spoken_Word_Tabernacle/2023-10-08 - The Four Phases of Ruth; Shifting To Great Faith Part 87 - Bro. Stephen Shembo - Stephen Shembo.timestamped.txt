[1:04:12] compromise I
[1:04:14] want amen am amen amen glory to God
[1:04:18] let's go to theonomy chapter 2 verse one
[1:04:21] thank you my friend I callot is on so uh
[1:04:24] he just gave me a
[1:04:26] [Laughter]
[1:04:29] signal so we're doing great wonderful
[1:04:34] service song service it was wonderful I
[1:04:38] cut off a lot of stuff because I need to
[1:04:40] go straight to the material because
[1:04:42] there's many laying in this scripture a
[1:04:44] whole lot yes so praise God H I wonder
[1:04:50] why
[1:04:51] Joseph had the B right
[1:04:54] and I was dealing with someone yesterday
[1:04:57] just uh my counseling I like family
[1:05:00] member talking and then the Holy Spirit
[1:05:02] drop that on me and I want to hide it
[1:05:05] and the person say hey if he drop when
[1:05:07] I'm talking to you it means he belong to
[1:05:09] me you need to deliver that so that
[1:05:12] person already knows the Revelation and
[1:05:15] finally I understood why Joseph have to
[1:05:17] get the birth
[1:05:23] right
[1:05:25] do you know that the birth R was given
[1:05:27] to Joseph you know that
[1:05:31] right do you know
[1:05:37] that if you don't know it's in first
[1:05:40] Chronicle 5 that's verse 1 and 2 the
[1:05:43] Bible say the birthright was removed
[1:05:45] from Ruben and given to Joseph because
[1:05:48] of what Robin did amen but before I
[1:05:52] start the scripture I'm sorry I got to
[1:05:54] Dr this okay if you notice if you read
[1:05:58] the story The Bible
[1:06:00] correctly Jacob never loved
[1:06:06] Leah you know that right Leah was force
[1:06:10] they play a trick and they put Leah into
[1:06:13] him but he never loved Leah he always
[1:06:16] loved
[1:06:18] Rachel everybody okay and the first born
[1:06:21] of Rachel was Joseph
[1:06:27] so so technically speaking Joseph should
[1:06:31] be the oldest
[1:06:32] [Applause]
[1:06:34] son amen but for some reason Leah was
[1:06:38] pushed before and the son of Leah became
[1:06:41] the firstborn which was
[1:06:44] Ruben and he did a mess and God removed
[1:06:49] the birth right and went with it and
[1:06:52] never gave to anybody else but he went
[1:06:54] went back and give it to Joseph because
[1:06:56] it belonged to Joseph to begin
[1:06:59] with Hallelujah yes sir in other word
[1:07:02] what God has for
[1:07:04] [Applause]
[1:07:09] you it doesn't matter how many politics
[1:07:12] will go around God will take a r back
[1:07:15] and give it back to
[1:07:22] you yes so don't give
[1:07:30] up let's go to the thron of me too glory
[1:07:34] to God you there amen you there amen
[1:07:38] then we turned and took our journey into
[1:07:40] the Wilderness by the way of the Red Sea
[1:07:43] we read this last Sunday as the Lord
[1:07:46] spoke to me and we did what compass in

[1:08:16] circle
[1:08:20] around Israel was supposed to pass by
[1:08:23] the mountain and continue straight but
[1:08:26] there is like a wheel
[1:08:30] pool like a
[1:08:32] Vortex around this mountain when you get
[1:08:35] closer to that mountain it suck you into

[1:10:11] around because they could be in a s
[1:10:15] mode in the relaxed mode in the mode
[1:10:19] that they don't need any more
[1:10:21] progression but God is De with you
[1:10:25] differently I'm talking to the young
[1:10:28] people in this church so don't be
[1:10:30] looking at adult and people who linger
[1:10:32] so long in the message because you don't
[1:10:35] know whether they are progressing or
[1:10:37] they got
[1:10:38] settle if you hang around them too much
[1:10:42] you will begin to turn
[1:10:47] around amen
[1:10:52] amen
[1:10:54] the Bible say you have compassed this
[1:10:56] mountain

[1:11:05] long enough turn you what so brother
[1:11:10] Bram we read this last Sunday said that
[1:11:13] Monir belonged to Esau that's what the
[1:11:16] scripture says and brother BR I'm say
[1:11:18] mon was a
[1:11:21] denomination amen am brother Bram say
[1:11:24] when something become a
[1:11:27] denomination it is
[1:11:30] dead and it will never rise anymore
[1:11:33] brother Bram Say Never in other word
[1:11:36] there is no more hope never it will rise
[1:11:39] again everybody okay so this walk of
[1:11:43] going around something and coming back
[1:11:45] on the same spot brother Bram called
[1:11:48] this the death
[1:11:52] walk
[1:11:54] everybody okay if you go around and you
[1:11:57] come back on the same spot and you're
[1:11:59] not progressing brother Bram say you hit
[1:12:01] the death work brother Bram said the
[1:12:03] only way you can get out of this you
[1:12:05] must have a
[1:12:07] guide and thank God Israel had a god
[1:12:11] which was the pillar of
[1:12:15] fire everybody okay a denomination can
[1:12:20] be a church in the
[1:12:22] message
[1:12:26] a denomination can also be a
[1:12:30] [Applause]
[1:12:33] person in other word when you come
[1:12:35] around this brother he doesn't strive
[1:12:38] for growing with the
[1:12:40] [Applause]
[1:12:42] Lord they develop what they call
[1:12:45] religious
[1:12:47] spirit the church is no longer something
[1:12:50] for progression but it's something to
[1:12:52] keep them warm enough
[1:12:55] and if you get along them too long you
[1:12:57] will find yourself you going in a
[1:13:00] circle because they will never talk
[1:13:02] about the promised
[1:13:08] land but you were not meant for mon you
[1:13:12] were meant to go beyond
[1:13:14] [Applause]
[1:13:17] Jordan everybody good jump to verse four
[1:13:22] and command and you the people saying
[1:13:25] you are to pass through the coast of
[1:13:28] your
[1:13:30] who God is calling him
[1:13:34] Brethren just like we call one another
[1:13:36] God bless you
[1:13:37] brother not one brother but Brethren
[1:13:40] they
[1:13:41] plural so who I'm talking to is somebody
[1:13:45] that you call
[1:13:47] brother I don't deal with denomination
[1:13:50] outside the message I deal with denom
[1:13:53] ation in the
[1:13:55] message that person that you call
[1:13:58] Brother you need to watch where is he at
[1:14:01] is he in the
[1:14:02] motion or is he settle if it settle they
[1:14:06] could have been deatha have struck
[1:14:09] them and he become a hindrance for you
[1:14:12] you're not moving forward you're just
[1:14:14] going around in a
[1:14:19] circle everybody okay we clear brother
[1:14:23] the Bible says that when you go through
[1:14:25] your brethren the children of Esau which
[1:14:28] dwell in s and they shall be afraid of
[1:14:30] you we talk about this last Sunday take
[1:14:33] your goodhead to yourself therefore and
[1:14:36] do what verse five not with them don't
[1:14:39] content with them don't start any
[1:14:41] argument the era of argument in this
[1:14:44] message is
[1:14:46] over the era of fighting with Doctrine
[1:14:49] is over yes sir amen amen m not with
[1:14:52] them
[1:14:53] amen m not with them for I will not give
[1:14:57] you of their land no no such much as a
[1:15:01] what fo bread not even a little bit
[1:15:03] don't even try amen amen because I have
[1:15:06] given man say to who es for what
[1:15:10] possession so give who gave Esau that
[1:15:19] possession so Esau received something
[1:15:22] from God yes sir but that which he
[1:15:25] received doesn't belong to
[1:15:26] [Music]
[1:15:28] you even though he come from
[1:15:33] God you got to know where you going you
[1:15:36] need to know your destination if you
[1:15:38] have not reach your destination yet it
[1:15:40] doesn't belong to you that belong to
[1:15:43] Esau that's why Esau is in a relaxed
[1:15:48] mode in other
[1:15:50] word this is the further Esau can
[1:15:57] go in other word don't try to bring new
[1:16:00] revelation to
[1:16:02] [Music]
[1:16:02] [Applause]

[1:16:09] anymore Esau has
[1:16:14] Plateau Esau is stretched to his
[1:16:22] limit listen to what brother Bram say
[1:16:24] brother Bram say see that you don't go
[1:16:28] over on man now because I give that to
[1:16:32] who es that is all the father he
[1:16:36] supposed to
[1:16:42] go so people are stuck in
[1:16:46] doctrines they can't move anymore in
[1:16:48] other word there is no fresh
[1:16:52] revelation
[1:16:56] when you start bringing them up they're
[1:16:57] like where you getting those stuff they

[1:17:58] Territory they got used two months
[1:18:04] here everybody okay everybody okay
[1:18:08] everybody okay if you linger long enough

[1:18:12] same
[1:18:15] [Applause]
[1:18:17] thing if you go to the meeting it's like
[1:18:20] a
[1:18:21] routine

[1:18:27] people are tired they already know
[1:18:29] what's going to
[1:18:32] happen I'm preaching to this
[1:18:34] [Applause]
[1:18:38] church there is no more fresh
[1:18:42] anointing that is coming to push the
[1:18:45] people
[1:18:46] [Applause]
[1:18:49] [Music]
[1:18:51] forward
[1:18:56] brother brandham say oh we are so and so

[1:20:22] that you do what and you shall also buy
[1:20:25] water of them for what money that you
[1:20:27] may do what we already explained this
[1:20:30] for the Lord your God has blessed you in
[1:20:33] all the work of your hand he knows
[1:20:36] you're working through this Great
[1:20:39] Wilderness uh this Great Wilderness this

[1:20:44] God has been with who the you have
[1:20:47] lacked what nothing they lack nothing
[1:20:49] but they were not in the promise 9 yet
[1:20:53] [Music]
[1:20:55] they lack nothing but they were not
[1:20:57] where God want them to be
[1:21:01] yet so you got to know what is in the
[1:21:04] promised land that right now I'm eating
[1:21:08] the
[1:21:09] Mana right now my clothing are not wor
[1:21:12] now my shoes are still the same but God
[1:21:15] is saying you have not reach
[1:21:18] yet and this isau brother Bram say they
[1:21:21] were B
[1:21:24] line they were very close to the
[1:21:27] promised land but they were not in the
[1:21:29] promised land so no matter how much you
[1:21:32] can bring out Esau will never swallow it
[1:21:36] because that's the further he can
[1:21:40] see if you sarch his eyes he get
[1:21:47] blurred he can't launch into the
[1:21:51] deep are we together are we together
[1:21:55] let's go to
[1:21:58] Joshua Joshua chapter
[1:22:02] 5 everybody
[1:22:05] okay we need to move
[1:22:08] northward sir if you look at verse 29
[1:22:12] North word was you have to cross
[1:22:15] Jordan you can read it at home Joshua 5:
[1:22:19] 6 if you thereare you can say amen amen
[1:22:22] the Bible says for the children of
[1:22:24] Israel walk 40 years in the
[1:22:28] wilderness until till all the people
[1:22:31] that were men of what war they love to
[1:22:34] fight all the time which came out of
[1:22:37] what Egypt were consumed because they
[1:22:40] obey not the voice of the Lord to whom
[1:22:43] the Lord saw that he would not show them
[1:22:45] the land which the Lord SW to their
[1:22:47] father that he would give us a land that
[1:22:50] flows with what milk and honey so every
[1:22:53] Fighters
[1:22:56] dead everybody okay verse seven and
[1:22:59] their
[1:23:00] children not the fighters the children
[1:23:02] of the fighter that new generation come
[1:23:05] on that third
[1:23:08] generation amen whom he raised whom they
[1:23:12] raised up whom he raised up in their
[1:23:15] stead who raised them up
[1:23:18] Joshua go back read God God raised them
[1:23:22] up so God brought a new
[1:23:25] crop amen instead them Joshua did what
[1:23:30] circumcised we already went through this
[1:23:32] right so they were not even circumcised
[1:23:35] they were so busy on the fight until the
[1:23:38] children were not even
[1:23:40] [Applause]
[1:23:42] circumstanced and we wonder why are
[1:23:44] children leaving the message why are
[1:23:46] children having all this kind of stuff
[1:23:48] in the
[1:23:50] message the daddy were in a
[1:23:57] fight sit down to argue about the
[1:24:00] doctrines for they were
[1:24:02] uncircumcised because they had not
[1:24:04] circumcised them by the water so what
[1:24:07] were they doing what kept them
[1:24:13] busy verse 8 and it came to pass when
[1:24:16] they had done circumcising all the
[1:24:19] people that they abor in their place in
[1:24:22] the camp till they were whole in other
[1:24:24] word heill and the Lord said to Joshua
[1:24:28] this day have I roll the way the
[1:24:31] reproach of Egypt from off of you that
[1:24:34] worthiness is taken off from the
[1:24:36] church with a new circumcision of
[1:24:39] Joshua amen wherefore the Holy Spirit
[1:24:43] wherefore the name of the place is
[1:24:45] called gilar to this
[1:24:47] day and the children of Israel encamp in
[1:24:51] gilga and did what kept the Passover on
[1:24:54] the 14th day of the month at evening in
[1:24:57] the plains of Jericho they are in the
[1:24:59] promised land and they did eat of the
[1:25:03] what old corn of the land on the morrow
[1:25:07] after the Passover and leav cakes and
[1:25:12] porch corn in the self same day and the
[1:25:16] Mana did what on
[1:25:21] the
[1:25:23] so when the corn
[1:25:25] come it turned off the
[1:25:29] Mana the Mana help for 40 years but when
[1:25:32] you enter in the promised land they turn
[1:25:35] off the
[1:25:38] Mana you need to eat the
[1:25:44] cornbread you cannot continue with a
[1:25:47] faith of
[1:25:51] manner you cannot continue with the
[1:25:54] faith of Mana that's right the faith of
[1:25:57] Mana we've been fighting all along no
[1:25:59] more Mana Faith
[1:26:04] cornbread I'm reading the Bible I'm
[1:26:06] reading the Bible in other word Israel
[1:26:10] progress and the cornbread is in the
[1:26:12] promised land when you get there no more
[1:26:14] Mana the Mana was Angelic food the Mana
[1:26:18] was good but it's no longer good in the
[1:26:21] Promised Land
[1:26:23] [Applause]
[1:26:26] can I say it again the Mana was good he
[1:26:29] kept Israel all along but when you enter
[1:26:33] to the promised land you cannot eat
[1:26:36] Mana you need to change
[1:26:39] [Applause]
[1:26:44] diet in other word as much as the man
[1:26:47] help you he can no longer help you in
[1:26:50] the Promised Land
[1:26:54] H so you better as long get used to the
[1:26:58] new
[1:26:59] diet because you won't see Mana no
[1:27:05] more but isau was in the wildness over
[1:27:09] there that's the territory of the
[1:27:17] Mana as we enter the promised land amen
[1:27:22] amen no more
[1:27:25] Mana this very good food this Angelic
[1:27:28] food was very good it kept us going on
[1:27:32] for 40 years but when you enter the
[1:27:35] promised
[1:27:37] land you got to leave
[1:27:42] Mana how can you leave something that
[1:27:44] God was giving
[1:27:46] you I'm just asking you a question the
[1:27:49] one who was rning Mana was God so how
[1:27:52] can you leave something that God was
[1:27:54] giving
[1:27:57] you the one who was sending Mana is God
[1:28:01] when they were in the wilderness if you
[1:28:03] refuse Mana you in trouble but when you
[1:28:05] enter in the promised land if you keep
[1:28:08] Mana you in
[1:28:09] [Applause]
[1:28:13] trouble in the promised landine you
[1:28:15] cannot eat Mana the diet of the promised
[1:28:19] land require
[1:28:21] corn
[1:28:27] Jesus say your father ate mana and they
[1:28:30] were all
[1:28:32] de so you can eat mana and
[1:28:36] [Applause]
[1:28:38] die and brother Bram say dead means
[1:28:41] eternally separated with
[1:28:46] God so in other word somehow in The
[1:28:50] Exodus the diet must
[1:28:57] change we got to leave the baby
[1:29:01] [Music]
[1:29:05] [Applause]
[1:29:09] diet the way you looking at me it's like
[1:29:12] I'm reading a different
[1:29:13] [Laughter]
[1:29:16] Bible
[1:29:18] amen amen am verse 12 and mana seiz on
[1:29:23] the morrow after they have eaten of the
[1:29:26] old corn of the land neither had the
[1:29:30] children of Israel Mana how anymore who
[1:29:33] turned off the
[1:29:36] Mana why didn't God leave the Mana and
[1:29:39] the corn
[1:29:40] together the two cannot work
[1:29:47] together the two food don't work
[1:29:50] together as much as we appreciate the
[1:29:54] Mana but we must
[1:29:57] transition we must
[1:30:02] shift he says anymore but they did eat
[1:30:06] of the water fruit of the Lamb of who
[1:30:09] came in that year and it came to pass
[1:30:13] when
[1:30:15] Joshua was by Jericho that he lift up
[1:30:19] his eyes and look and behold
[1:30:22] there stood the pillar of
[1:30:27] fire you know that man was the pillar of
[1:30:29] fire right do you know that right you
[1:30:33] don't know that man okay slow down okay
[1:30:36] let's see that man he says and stood a
[1:30:40] man when we say a man we're thinking
[1:30:42] about me and you we stood a man opposite
[1:30:45] him with what his
[1:30:48] sword so in the promised land when the
[1:30:51] man es a man came and that man had a
[1:31:01] sword you need to know who that man is
[1:31:04] so you will know who the sword of the
[1:31:07] what kind of Sword is
[1:31:11] there that sword was never shown in the
[1:31:15] [Applause]
[1:31:16] wilderness I'm reading the Bible
[1:31:19] my did you see Moses a sword
[1:31:27] [Music]
[1:31:29] today amen amen and Joshua went to him
[1:31:33] and said to him are you for
[1:31:35] us or for our adversary and he says nay
[1:31:41] but as the who captain of the host of
[1:31:44] Who the Lord I am now how
[1:31:47] come let's identify this man before I
[1:31:50] move forward and Joshua fell on his face
[1:31:54] to the Earth and did what worship here
[1:31:58] oh Israel the Lord your God is how many
[1:32:00] God you shall worship only
[1:32:03] who so who is that
[1:32:08] man who is that man so that sword is the
[1:32:12] sword of
[1:32:18] [Applause]
[1:32:20] who
[1:32:23] so that s so okay let me read it again
[1:32:27] let me read down and he did worship and
[1:32:29] say to him what says my Lord do you see

[1:42:29] yet God won't eat a green
[1:42:33] bread you must be well wrapped
[1:42:38] mature because he is

[1:51:57] need your physical being I just need one
[1:52:01] thing only there is not in other word
[1:52:04] after that I don't have anything else to
[1:52:06] ask
[1:52:08] you sir so if you asking God one thing
[1:52:12] make sure that one thing covers

[1:53:03] out everybody okay and to another one
[1:53:06] come and he comes and to my servant do
[1:53:09] this and he doesn't when Jesus Heard
[1:53:14] It In other words somebody begin to
[1:53:17] teach Jesus that all along here you were
[1:53:19] dealing with Father
[1:53:22] caliber but I'm going to make you know
[1:53:24] also who you
[1:53:26] are I know that in you you have more
[1:53:29] than just laying
[1:53:30] [Applause]
[1:53:32] hands and let me activate that that
[1:53:36] more the way I know it is because myself
[1:53:40] I'm under the authority when I'm under
[1:53:42] Authority I use my word I use
[1:53:46] command and command move stuff without
[1:53:50] me being
[1:53:56] involved in other word if I want to
[1:53:58] build a building I don't need to be
[1:54:00] there I can just speak the word and the
[1:54:03] building will be there if I want my car
[1:54:06] to be washed I don't need to be there if
[1:54:09] I speak the word I go to sleep I'm
[1:54:11] expecting to come out that car need to
[1:54:13] be
[1:54:16] washed I don't need to supervise who is
[1:54:20] there to make sure they're doing the
[1:54:25] work can I continue glory to God he says
[1:54:30] verse uh 11 10 when Jesus heard it he
[1:54:33] did what Marvel and said to them that
[1:54:35] follow him verily I say to you I have
[1:54:39] not found so great faith no not in what
[1:54:44] Israel so there are two things here we
[1:54:48] already understand this number number
[1:54:49] one this Roman Centurion refuses a
[1:54:53] physical
[1:54:57] contact sir everybody okay and number
[1:55:01] two Jesus is saying clearly that this
[1:55:04] kind of faith is not at the Jewish
[1:55:11] people in other word this Faith you will
[1:55:14] always found it at the
[1:55:18] Gentile
[1:55:20] amen because we found out that this
[1:55:23] faith can happen in man which is the
[1:55:26] Roman Centurion and this faith will
[1:55:28] happen also in woman which was the Saran
[1:55:32] woman both of them were not
[1:55:36] Jews amen the Saran even tried to
[1:55:40] approach like a Jew and Jesus kept
[1:55:42] silence in other words God was giving
[1:55:45] you a signal that you are you are
[1:55:48] shooting lower than what I made
[1:55:50] [Applause]
[1:55:54] you I don't know if you get me she was
[1:55:57] coming as son of David Son of David and
[1:56:01] Jesus look he say a gentile trying to be
[1:56:04] a Jew if she knew who she
[1:56:07] [Applause]
[1:56:12] is everybody
[1:56:15] okay everybody okay everybody okay and
[1:56:19] the woman keep begging Bing Jesus say
[1:56:23] how can I activate this thing he turned
[1:56:26] around he said you
[1:56:28] [Applause]
[1:56:32] dog that Faith only look for the word of
[1:56:37] Jesus if Jesus ever speak something he
[1:56:41] put himself in
[1:56:43] [Applause]
[1:56:44] [Music]
[1:56:45] [Applause]
[1:56:48] trouble
[1:56:53] as soon as Jesus spoke something she
[1:56:56] didn't use anything else but what Jesus
[1:56:59] spoke she said ah you using dog let me
[1:57:04] get dog you know what dog is dog eat the
[1:57:09] crumbs of the children table Jesus look
[1:57:12] he said that's what I was looking
[1:57:15] for I know you can do better than
[1:57:18] that
[1:57:21] everybody okay and Jesus say for this
[1:57:27] say the woman never use the word Jesus
[1:57:32] [Music]
[1:57:33] Christ everybody okay for this saying
[1:57:37] the devil over there is
[1:57:40] gone the woman never say Satan now you
[1:57:43] can leave my children what she spoke
[1:57:47] take care of the devil
[1:57:50] everybody okay everybody okay so it's a
[1:57:53] faith that Jewish people don't have it
[1:57:57] takes gentile people but the danger of
[1:57:59] the sarof phenician woman she was a
[1:58:02] gentile but she's trying to approach God
[1:58:05] in a Jewish way which way was also
[1:58:13] working everybody okay everybody good
[1:58:17] everybody good so the major two I'm
[1:58:19] handling today is she refus any physical
[1:58:23] contact with God the man and it's a
[1:58:26] faith that lays within the Gentile and
[1:58:29] Jesus called this great
[1:58:33] faith and Jesus says this in verse 11 he
[1:58:37] says and I say unto you that many shall
[1:58:40] come what from the East and West and sit
[1:58:43] down with who Abraham and who Isaac and
[1:58:47] who Jacob in the king om of what heaven
[1:58:50] he didn't say
[1:58:54] Israel he said
[1:58:56] Jacob amen Israel was not born
[1:59:00] yet in other word it's in other word
[1:59:03] these people identify with Abraham
[1:59:07] before he became a
[1:59:09] [Applause]
[1:59:10] [Music]
[1:59:12] Jew sir everybody okay and that's why
[1:59:16] they will sit with Abraham with Isaac
[1:59:18] with he stop because after Jacob Israel
[1:59:22] start but you cannot find that faith in
[1:59:24] Israel you have to be outside of the
[1:59:27] band of
[1:59:29] [Applause]
[1:59:29] [Music]
[1:59:32] Israel everybody clear everybody clear
[1:59:36] so it's a faith that refuse any physical
[1:59:40] contact and it's a faith that you only
[1:59:43] find at the
[1:59:45] Gentile everybody okay listen to brother
[1:59:48] Bram now
[1:59:50] brother Bram say the seven Angel message
[1:59:54] under the same what trumpet everything
[1:59:58] exactly the same seal is to what in
[2:00:01] other word what is he going to do he's
[2:00:04] to call the people the bread out of the
[2:00:09] what Pentecostal and what world
[2:00:12] tradition stop so the message of brother
[2:00:16] Bram is a message that would do
[2:00:19] something to
[2:00:23] us everybody okay everybody okay when he
[2:00:27] does something to us whatever that
[2:00:30] message does it will pull you from two
[2:00:37] tradition he will remove you from
[2:00:41] Pentecostal tradition and he will remove
[2:00:45] you from the tradition of the
[2:00:48] world
[2:00:49] amen but if you are pulled from a
[2:00:52] Pentecostal tradition and from the word
[2:00:54] where is he bringing you
[2:00:56] to brother Bram say the BR out of the
[2:01:00] Pentecostal and word tradition to the
[2:01:03] genuine what which is what the
[2:01:08] word so this message have to take you
[2:01:11] all the way to the
[2:01:13] [Applause]
[2:01:17] word he bring you to the word because
[2:01:20] the Roman sanio say speak the what
[2:01:26] word everybody okay he said to the word
[2:01:30] which is Crist how impersonated in his
[2:01:33] what word made flesh among who us listen
[2:01:37] to brother BR I'm cramming my friend he
[2:01:40] says so it is with the church that
[2:01:44] refuses to become
[2:01:46] pregnant in the age that we live living
[2:01:50] to bring forth children of this what
[2:01:53] age we are not
[2:01:58] Lutheran we are not
[2:02:01] wling neither are we P so if somebody
[2:02:06] get in the message church we should be
[2:02:09] different than
[2:02:11] [Applause]
[2:02:14] Pentecostal a mess a church should be
[2:02:16] different than a
[2:02:17] Lutheran should be different than a
[2:02:20] prian church it should be different than
[2:02:24] a Baptist Church in other word The
[2:02:27] Message Church is a unique
[2:02:29] [Applause]
[2:02:33] Church the only way you can compare a
[2:02:37] message Church a message church is
[2:02:39] compare with the
[2:02:41] [Applause]
[2:02:44] word everybody clear brother Bram say we
[2:02:48] we got to be children of this age
[2:02:52] through what the pregnancy of the
[2:02:54] pregnancy of the word of God to bring
[2:02:56] forth what a child of this age a what
[2:02:59] the sea child amen I hope you understand
[2:03:03] could not be pregnant no so what did he
[2:03:06] do he did what put her away into what
[2:03:09] divorc but she Dar put him away he did
[2:03:12] what put her away brother Bram say God
[2:03:15] put all this church in
[2:03:17] divorcement like the king did to
[2:03:20] V amen and brother Bram say the reason
[2:03:24] why God did that they did not want to
[2:03:27] move with the further part of the
[2:03:30] [Applause]
[2:03:31] word everybody okay everybody okay so
[2:03:35] our church should be
[2:03:37] different that's when you get into a
[2:03:39] message Church it should be different
[2:03:42] than any
[2:03:45] denomination different in our way of
[2:03:48] dressing
[2:03:49] different in our way of talking

[2:21:48] our father worship where in this
[2:21:51] mountain and you say that in Jerusalem
[2:21:54] is the place where men ought to do what
[2:21:56] worship Jesus said to her woman believe
[2:21:59] me the hour coming when
[2:22:03] neither in this mountain nor yet where
[2:22:08] at Jerusalem worship the what father you
[2:22:12] worship you know not what we know what
[2:22:15] we worship for salvation is of the what
[2:22:19] Jews so salvation is of the Jew
[2:22:24] salvation came from the
[2:22:27] Jew salvation came from the Jew but the
[2:22:31] Jew had a
[2:22:35] tradition and their tradition was the
[2:22:37] laying on on hand and all Apostle were
[2:22:46] Jews
[2:22:47] [Music]
[2:22:47] [Applause]
[2:22:50] say Amen every apostle was a Jew so the
[2:22:54] Apostle and Jesus Christ carry a
[2:22:58] tradition that they bled into the
[2:23:01] [Applause]
[2:23:03] church and brother Bram say it is
[2:23:06] Apostolic because all of them were Jews
[2:23:08] and salvation came from the Jew so not
[2:23:11] only did salvation come but the
[2:23:14] tradition of the Jew were also
[2:23:16] introduced into to the
[2:23:21] church hold on my friend I know you
[2:23:24] waiting on Mark 16 that don't worry I'm
[2:23:27] loaded everybody okay verse 22 but the
[2:23:31] hour cometh and now is when the true
[2:23:35] what worshipers shall worship the father
[2:23:38] where in spirit and in what truth for
[2:23:41] the father seeketh what such to worship
[2:23:43] so we found out here that brother Bram
[2:23:46] says that the apostolic way is of laying
[2:23:50] on hand because all Apostle were Jew so
[2:23:53] They Carried that even Jesus Christ
[2:23:55] adopted that but the same Jesus say uh
[2:23:58] uh uh uh uh uh uh when I look at this
[2:24:01] kind of faith I don't see this faith in
[2:24:04] Israel but Salvation came from the Jew
[2:24:08] but how do you deal with Mark 16 brother
[2:24:10] stepen let me answer you now brother
[2:24:13] Steven brother Bram says this I want you
[2:24:17] to remember this and I try to go I try

[2:42:52] everything you're doing for

[2:42:59] program this is your program you're the
[2:43:02] one that set this program and you built
[2:43:05] us for this program and you are just
[2:43:07] coming now to let us know that this is
[2:43:11] what I have been longing for this is the
[2:43:14] reason why I you inent time this is the
[2:43:18] reason why I chose you to be in this age
[2:43:21] of laia because I knew what caliber of a
[2:43:24] word I'm sending that's why your Prophet
[2:43:27] told us that the way you using the
[2:43:30] messenger is just an example to the way
[2:43:34] you will use every Believers of that
[2:43:37] Church Father Lord may you touch
[2:43:40] everybody yes L may you see where we are
[2:43:43] in our different level of faith
[2:43:46] and may you help us grow as the Apostle
[2:43:49] Paul say so that we can increase and we
[2:43:53] can match our Gentile
[2:43:55] dispensation where
[2:43:59] father we can take you by your word yes
[2:44:02] Lord Lord when you want to manifest the
[2:44:05] Messi son you did it in your
[2:44:09] flesh because he was Jewish you did it
[2:44:12] in your flesh to the Samaritan because
[2:44:15] of their tradition but when you look at
[2:44:18] the Gentile you say I don't need to be
[2:44:20] there physically am because the faith of
[2:44:23] the Gentile don't need my physical being
[2:44:26] father that's why you came in the person
[2:44:28] of MEC and you impersonate yourself
[2:44:32] again to produce the mic son without
[2:44:35] your physical body because you knew we
[2:44:38] were able to recognize those sign
[2:44:41] because we are Abraham's seed father may
[2:44:44] we recognize them power of the word and
[2:44:47] cling onto the word because the word
[2:44:49] will take us all the way through father
[2:44:51] I pray for every family the word has
[2:44:55] been spoken you know the need you know
[2:44:57] what they're struggling you know where
