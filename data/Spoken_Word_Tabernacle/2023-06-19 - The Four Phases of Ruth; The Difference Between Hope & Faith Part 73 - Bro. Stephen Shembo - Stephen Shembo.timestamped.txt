[25:30] Hallelujah
[25:32] praise the Lord
[25:34] a little quick update on my wife this
[25:37] I'm going to turn it I had it wrote down
[25:39] under Praises but I moved it over to
[25:41] prayer
[25:42] she went to a doctor and got an x-ray
[25:44] and
[25:46] um probably all of us in here uh have I
[25:49] guess it's called the sternum the lower
[25:51] back we all have five discs in the lower
[25:54] back
[25:55] yeah I don't know what it's called
[25:57] sternums in the chat in the yeah okay I
[26:00] y'all forgive me
[26:03] so
[26:04] she has six
[26:06] she was born with six discs back there
[26:09] so there's an extra one that's the the
[26:11] clicking and the moving and I don't
[26:13] think it's completely the source of any
[26:15] pain that she's going in that's why I
[26:17] moved it over because we're going to
[26:19] speak to that disc a lot I mean he can
[26:22] dissolve it everything else looks good
[26:25] the you know between the disc and
[26:26] everything else
[26:28] um
[26:29] so we want we want it to go we want it
[26:32] to go away
[26:34] but she made there may be some other
[26:36] concerns that's causing the problems
[26:37] that we're still checking into so I
[26:39] moved it to prayer so please keep it
[26:41] please keep your um in your prayer amen
[26:44] she works very hard you know on our
[26:46] little farm that we're trying to build
[26:48] and uh
[26:49] probably harder than the rest of us
[26:51] except on the weekends when everybody's
[26:53] home but hers is daily so
[26:56] you know we're thinking God gave us this
[26:58] little place where I would you know
[27:00] why would she have problems in her body
[27:03] if we can't maintain it so I'm going to
[27:06] keep it right here this morning and go
[27:08] to the Lord does anybody have we got an
[27:10] unspoken requests yes ma'am

[40:05] that are here
[40:06] and the future fathers
[40:10] amen Happy Father's Day
[40:19] amen
[40:20] do you know that a pastor is a father
[40:23] you know that
[40:27] butter brother
[40:29] Branham says sometimes I preach pretty
[40:33] rough
[40:34] because I see that somebody is getting
[40:36] out of line
[40:40] can you say Amen
[40:42] you see you are supposed to do that
[40:46] when somebody's getting out of line you
[40:49] come up and preach hard a real daddy
[40:52] will
[40:54] if somebody's getting out of line a true
[40:56] daddy we correct it
[40:59] brother Brian I'm saying why he shake
[41:02] you and say here get back here in line
[41:05] if he is a what
[41:07] a real true water
[41:10] so sometimes your pastor has to weigh
[41:14] down on something
[41:16] just just do it
[41:20] because he is a water
[41:23] to you you see trying to keep you water
[41:27] because he's watching over you which the
[41:30] Holy Ghost has made him the overseer of
[41:33] the and you must always watch
[41:37] so if I don't correct you when you go in
[41:39] other line something is wrong
[41:42] amen so a true father will always always
[41:46] try to do that amen
[41:48] so it's Father's Day and it's my wife's
[41:51] birthday
[41:54] foreign
[41:59] and we appreciate everybody I bought
[42:02] some cake and the young sister and the
[42:05] whole VIP ancestor were able to come so
[42:09] they started the party yesterday in my
[42:11] house so after the young sister's
[42:13] meeting we went home and Cut the Cake
[42:16] and sing Happy Birthday and the gift and
[42:18] everything so I am saturated
[42:22] and I told them that even though even if
[42:25] I don't receive any gift your presence
[42:27] is already a gift so just seeing you
[42:30] being there it's what's matter amen you
[42:33] know my wife told me a story this
[42:35] morning that her uncle one of her uncle
[42:37] told her
[42:38] my father-in-law
[42:40] took so long before he can have a baby
[42:44] so everybody thought something was wrong
[42:46] and people were making fun of him and
[42:49] everything so the first one that came up
[42:52] was my wife
[42:54] amen so when that came up it was like a
[42:58] miracle because everybody could not
[43:01] believe that this doctor finally is
[43:03] going to have a baby so the day she was
[43:05] born people were bringing gift
[43:07] amen so my uncle my uh uh big brother to
[43:14] my father who was really really really
[43:16] close to my father he also was around
[43:19] there so he came later I don't know if
[43:22] it's two weeks later or something he
[43:24] came to see the baby because everybody
[43:26] was talking about this baby this man was
[43:28] not having a child and finally he came
[43:30] so when he came he bought also his gift
[43:34] can I continue
[43:36] can I continue but when he bought his
[43:39] gift
[43:41] he brought the gift and he spoke to my
[43:44] father-in-law my parent-in-law and tell
[43:47] them that I'm not bringing the gift for
[43:49] the baby
[43:53] everybody okay
[43:54] he says that I'm bringing madari
[43:58] and I'm claiming this baby that one of
[44:02] my children will marry her
[44:11] may his soul rest in peace because he's
[44:15] already passed away but later on Dad the
[44:19] Lord
[44:20] I was born in another city she was born
[44:23] in another city down the road whatever
[44:26] he spoke happened
[44:28] [Applause]
[44:36] the way we grew up we were catholic
[44:41] if a Catholic can say something
[44:46] [Applause]
[44:50] and later on it happened how much more
[44:54] message believer
[45:00] everybody okay
[45:02] [Applause]
[45:03] oh my God it's getting juicy
[45:06] amen
[45:08] Glory Glory Hallelujah I'm sending I'm
[45:12] bringing greetings from Brother Brian
[45:14] Nadu
[45:15] some of you knew that he was around here
[45:18] so we communicated with him
[45:21] I believe it was an April and I told him
[45:24] by the time he get here on April he need
[45:27] to let me know so that he will be able
[45:29] to minister for us but by the time he
[45:31] got here his schedule was already booked
[45:34] to preach everywhere so there was no
[45:36] opportunity for him to do it I tried to
[45:38] see if there could be any changes in his
[45:41] schedule no he had to leave on Friday so
[45:43] he he was booked to preach everywhere
[45:45] except here so he sent greetings brother
[45:49] Kelly sent me the message so he's
[45:51] greeting the church and Lords willing
[45:53] maybe in the next opportunity when the
[45:55] Lord opened up the way he will be able
[45:57] to minister to us so the reason why I'm
[45:59] saying that somebody might have a
[46:01] question why he preached here he didn't
[46:03] preach here I know how to shoot the
[46:05] devil
[46:06] everybody okay so I'm giving you what
[46:08] happened so maybe God's willing if the
[46:10] Lord Terry and he doesn't come in the
[46:13] near future when he come back
[46:15] orchestrate everything the best way amen
[46:18] blessed be the name of the Lord how many
[46:21] are up to date with the sermon how many
[46:24] listened to the sermon on prayer
[46:26] everybody clear on prayer now you know
[46:28] how to pray
[46:30] you know how to pray
[46:32] so there is a strong pull for me to
[46:34] continue because we stopped at Hallowed
[46:36] be that name
[46:38] now we need to get to that Kingdom Come
[46:40] that will be done because that was the
[46:43] mother prayer so you need to negotiate
[46:45] with the deacon
[46:47] to find out when I can come up quickly
[46:50] to do it because my schedule is getting
[46:52] really really loaded quickly with with
[46:55] things that we have to do concerning the
[46:57] church amen

[48:28] you want to know what we talk about sure
[48:31] do you wanna
[48:36] do you want to know
[48:37] we talk about sexuality
[48:41] more than four hours because I don't
[48:43] want to have any problem down the road
[48:46] with what I see across the message we
[48:49] got this cell phone in the hand of
[48:51] children
[48:54] amen
[48:56] the 11 years old they got this
[48:58] they're 10 years old they got this
[49:00] whatever they're doing here you don't
[49:03] know
[49:05] everybody okay so when they start
[49:07] pornography at 10 years old
[49:10] and they get married at 30 or 25 there
[49:14] is a lot of stuff that have been
[49:15] downloaded in their mind
[49:18] amen we talk about going to heaven we
[49:21] talk about this we talk about that but
[49:23] we don't touch what is really needed for
[49:26] them to go to marriage
[49:28] like I said yesterday we usually tell
[49:31] the young sister to keep themselves
[49:32] virgin
[49:34] but we don't tell the boys
[49:36] and I gave you the quote brother Branham
[49:38] say even boys
[49:41] Brother David increase my my volume
[49:45] please
[49:46] everybody okay even boys are supposed to
[49:51] remain virgin
[49:52] [Applause]
[49:53] can you say Amen
[49:56] because the majority of the time it's
[49:59] the boys that Baxley
[50:01] and they go into the world and they do
[50:04] all kind of stuff over there
[50:06] everybody okay when they finish they
[50:09] don't come back empty
[50:12] to learn a lot of garbage over there
[50:15] everybody okay and they'll say brother
[50:18] Stephen I need to rededicate my life and
[50:22] we're gonna re-baptize them when they
[50:24] came out of the water they still have
[50:26] that knowledge over there
[50:28] and they're going to take that knowledge
[50:30] and bring you to our young sisters
[50:35] we need to know what we need to do and
[50:39] what we are not supposed to do
[50:42] we are different in our talking
[50:45] we are different in our living
[50:50] we are different in our Behavior
[50:54] we are even different in our sexual
[50:57] relationship
[51:04] I gave every quote and every scripture
[51:08] what brother Branham spoke about it amen
[51:11] I took the scripture I took the message
[51:14] and I took science and I mixed them
[51:17] together
[51:19] brother Branham and I gave you two
[51:21] quotes yesterday there was one that I
[51:23] didn't give you brother Branham say he
[51:26] took science the scripture and the
[51:28] message and mixed it together and bring
[51:30] the subject
[51:33] everybody okay I went I downloaded that
[51:37] in detail because we need to know what
[51:40] we're doing especially people that get
[51:42] married nowadays
[51:44] if you meet your wife in a nightclub
[51:47] what kind of Life were you living
[51:49] when you get converted
[51:52] your heart changed but the thing you
[51:54] learned there did you remove them what
[51:57] was right what was not right
[52:01] because the knowledge of sex was
[52:03] introduced by the serpenter
[52:07] so you need to we need to gauge up
[52:12] don't worry
[52:14] go to Second Timothy
[52:22] I don't play a game with the Devil
[52:26] yeah
[52:28] I don't play a game with the Devil
[52:33] if your pastor don't touch these things
[52:35] fine not me
[52:40] second Timothy no you can be seated
[52:42] that's not the scripture for it
[52:44] I'm sorry I appreciate the second
[52:46] Timothy chapter 3.
[52:48] let me lose somebody's feather
[52:53] if you dare you can say Amen
[52:56] second Timothy chapter 3 job to verse
[52:59] 16.
[53:02] because when we start talking about this
[53:04] kind of stuff somebody's blushing
[53:06] somebody's trembling somebody's holding
[53:09] the chair
[53:10] somebody say Pastor leave it leave it
[53:13] leave it leave it and the people are
[53:15] suffering
[53:17] I have people even outside this message
[53:21] and many people you know do you know how
[53:23] many people struggle with pornography
[53:33] second Timothy chapter three if I don't
[53:35] get to my message fine at least this one
[53:37] will help you

[53:52] all water scriptures is Water by water
[53:57] inspiration of Hope in other words every
[54:01] scripture that is written in this Bible
[54:03] comes from who
[54:06] so there is no scripture
[54:09] in this Bible that doesn't come from God
[54:14] can you say Amen
[54:15] the difference is God gave it to men
[54:18] and men put it down so everything that
[54:22] is written in this Bible you are under
[54:25] obligation to say Amen
[54:27] [Applause]
[54:29] everything
[54:31] everything
[54:32] even a Karma
[54:35] even a punctuation you are supposed to
[54:38] say Amen

[54:43] every scripture is given by inspiration
[54:47] of God and it's profitable for water in
[54:51] other words for teaching
[54:52] karma for water
[54:54] Kama for water and for water instruction
[54:59] how

[55:19] bishop

[55:28] given what is the purpose of that
[55:29] scripture verse 17 that who

[56:28] good works so everything that is written
[56:32] in this Bible is how
[56:35] inspired from who
[56:37] who spoke about it
[56:40] open Leviticus 15.
[56:47] I've been in this message for a while
[56:50] and I know the religious spirit in the
[56:53] message
[56:55] a religious hypocrite spirit
[57:03] are you there
[57:04] Leviticus 15 verse 18.
[57:09] I can give you more scripture than this

[57:39] they shall both bathe themselves in
[57:42] water and be unclean until the water is
[57:46] this scripture inspired yes or not
[57:49] [Applause]

[57:57] word he talked about sex

[1:03:51] problem with the messenger
[1:03:52] [Music]
[1:03:57] you want me to put that code back again
[1:04:01] let's go to mark 11.
[1:04:07] I'm not playing games
[1:04:13] if you think you know everything wait
[1:04:16] till I rip the scripture open
[1:04:19] and you would notice
[1:04:21] God made the difference between his
[1:04:25] people and those that were not his
[1:04:27] people
[1:04:29] even the Jews in their Anatomy
[1:04:32] were different than the Gentiles because
[1:04:35] they were circumstances
[1:04:38] oh
[1:04:41] thank you very much
[1:04:43] let's go to mark 11.
[1:04:48] there is capillary I forgot yesterday he
[1:04:51] came this morning you remind me when we
[1:04:53] start the next young sisters with it and
[1:04:56] you tell me and I will add them up
[1:05:01] amen
[1:05:02] Mark chapter 11 verse 12. if you dare
[1:05:05] you can say amen I kept the same
[1:05:07] scripture because we did it we were
[1:05:09] unable to touch anything I mean on any
[1:05:12] of them
[1:05:14] and on the moral when they were come
[1:05:17] from who from Bedtime from Bethany he
[1:05:21] was hungry you might be seated
[1:05:28] Jesus was not looking for something
[1:05:31] spiritual
[1:05:40] uh no problem
[1:05:43] and on the moral when they were come
[1:05:45] from Bethany he was hungry
[1:05:50] this hunger is not a spiritual hunger
[1:05:57] this is a desire that is natural
[1:06:01] it is a desire that is connected to the
[1:06:05] body
[1:06:06] everybody okay he was not looking for he
[1:06:09] was not hungry for the word because he
[1:06:12] was the word
[1:06:14] amen he was not looking for spiritual
[1:06:17] food that's not what the Bible said
[1:06:19] Jesus was looking for something natural
[1:06:23] something that can perish
[1:06:26] something
[1:06:28] something that can perish
[1:06:30] something that is temporal something
[1:06:33] that if you put it on the table you wait
[1:06:36] two days it will rot
[1:06:38] that's what Jesus was looking for
[1:06:42] what I'm trying to say is the need that
[1:06:45] Jesus had was not a spiritual need amen
[1:06:53] amen
[1:06:54] you ain't going in the rapture
[1:06:57] if you don't get to what I'm trying to
[1:06:59] say
[1:07:00] and I'm saying that by the prophet
[1:07:06] you will understand me
[1:07:08] verse 13 and seeing a fig tree a pharaoh
[1:07:14] having leaves
[1:07:16] he came
[1:07:17] if happily in other words perhaps he
[1:07:20] might find anything they're wrong
[1:07:23] and when he came to it he found nothing
[1:07:27] but water leaves for the time of fig was
[1:07:32] not yet
[1:07:35] so Jesus has and had the need
[1:07:39] but it was not according to the season
[1:07:42] [Applause]
[1:07:42] [Music]
[1:07:50] if he was the season of
[1:07:53] figs
[1:07:55] amen Jesus would just went
[1:08:00] take the Fig and go what power is it
[1:08:05] if our God there is an apple and I pull
[1:08:08] an apple did that demonstrate any power
[1:08:11] God made it made sure
[1:08:14] that there is no fig
[1:08:18] in other words are you okay
[1:08:21] because if Jesus goes and it's the
[1:08:23] season of food and he found fruit and he
[1:08:26] eat
[1:08:27] he doesn't impress anybody
[1:08:29] it is normal
[1:08:30] there is no miracle
[1:08:33] everybody okay but the time that Jesus
[1:08:37] went was not the time it was not the
[1:08:40] season
[1:08:42] so the desire came out of Caesar
[1:08:46] [Applause]
[1:08:49] are you following me are you following
[1:08:52] me in other words the desire the natural
[1:08:57] desire
[1:08:58] came when the condition are not met
[1:09:06] am I reading a different Bible
[1:09:10] you will have desire
[1:09:12] and the condition I met
[1:09:17] I have 500 in my bank account
[1:09:20] I'm hungry there is a McDonald is that
[1:09:24] do I need to pray
[1:09:25] what do I need to do swap my card
[1:09:29] and suck my card why am I ordering
[1:09:32] because I know I got the money but there
[1:09:34] will come a time when you're hungry
[1:09:39] and you don't have money
[1:09:41] but you need a solution
[1:09:45] the condition are not appropriate
[1:09:54] did you sleep well
[1:09:57] did you sleep well
[1:10:05] I have a good credit
[1:10:07] never messed up anything
[1:10:09] my credit is 845.
[1:10:13] my income is three hundred thousand
[1:10:16] dollars and I want to buy a house of two
[1:10:19] hundred thousand do you need the miracle
[1:10:22] do you need a miracle what do you have
[1:10:25] to do go apply and get a house and move
[1:10:28] on are you gonna come back and say
[1:10:30] praise the Lord the lord gave me a new
[1:10:32] house
[1:10:33] you won't probably remember that
[1:10:38] unless you're more spiritual then you
[1:10:41] will say thank God for giving me a house
[1:10:43] and giving me the money but if your
[1:10:45] credit is bad
[1:10:51] and you don't have the money
[1:10:53] and you don't have a good job
[1:10:56] but something in you
[1:11:00] [Applause]
[1:11:02] is pulling for the house
[1:11:04] [Applause]
[1:11:15] the conditions are not met in other
[1:11:18] words it is out of season
[1:11:24] what do you do
[1:11:28] verse 14.
[1:11:30] and Jesus answered and said to eat
[1:11:34] no man eat fruit of you hereafter
[1:11:38] forever and his disciple did what
[1:11:43] so this power
[1:11:46] was released when the condition were not
[1:11:50] met
[1:11:57] that's why I tell you please read your
[1:12:00] Cod book
[1:12:01] when brother Branham created Square
[1:12:08] the word there was very bad
[1:12:11] I have the code
[1:12:14] and brother Branham say under that
[1:12:17] wedding no squirrel can come out
[1:12:22] that's the weather
[1:12:24] that God loses
[1:12:27] [Music]
[1:12:28] to produce Square
[1:12:34] in other words this power works when
[1:12:38] things are impossible
[1:12:41] [Applause]
[1:12:47] when you reach your limit
[1:12:51] and you don't know what to do and you
[1:12:54] are stuck
[1:12:55] that's when the power works
[1:12:57] [Applause]
[1:13:00] [Music]
[1:13:02] job to verse 19. oh my God
[1:13:06] Jesus Christ we can even stop here you
[1:13:09] go home
[1:13:14] 19 and when the evening come came he
[1:13:19] went out of the city verse 20 and in the
[1:13:22] morning
[1:13:23] as they pass by they saw the fig tree
[1:13:27] dried up from the water The Roots
[1:13:30] you remember last Sunday
[1:13:32] Jesus spoke and went away
[1:13:36] somebody was taking care of the tree
[1:13:40] it was not Jesus
[1:13:42] Jesus didn't put the camera there or a
[1:13:45] John and he went to his bed and put a
[1:13:48] camera and watched her the tree is uh is
[1:13:51] dying
[1:13:52] foreign
[1:13:57] ate his supper and wake up in the
[1:14:00] morning and continue to go he said these
[1:14:02] guys I know them let's go this way come
[1:14:04] this way again come this way again
[1:14:08] I know these guys I know this guy come
[1:14:10] this way again and when Jesus was
[1:14:12] passing he even probably was looking
[1:14:14] somewhere else
[1:14:15] and say do you remember when we went to
[1:14:17] Galilee and someone said
[1:14:19] hold on
[1:14:22] don't go too far
[1:14:24] watch this watch what
[1:14:30] verse 21 and Peter calling to remember
[1:14:33] us say to him Master behold the Fig Tree
[1:14:37] which you curse is water whether the way
[1:14:40] why Peter
[1:14:44] do you know that Peter represented Faith
[1:14:46] yes
[1:14:49] see me if you need the quote
[1:14:53] let's go let's go to verse 22 and Jesus
[1:14:57] answering to them have water safe in God
[1:15:01] what does he mean
[1:15:03] hmm
[1:15:05] you showing me something and instead of
[1:15:09] Jesus saying wow
[1:15:11] Jesus look he said have faith in God
[1:15:16] what does he mean
[1:15:17] in other words
[1:15:20] the result of what the disciples saw
[1:15:27] amen was caused by faith
[1:15:32] I don't know if you're kidding me in
[1:15:35] other words Jesus was telling them it is
[1:15:39] first that did this
[1:15:46] I might drop this If I Stumble you
[1:15:48] that's okay
[1:15:50] okay
[1:15:51] he was not demand Jesus that did it
[1:16:01] brother Branham said Jesus was 100
[1:16:05] and 100.
[1:16:10] everybody okay
[1:16:11] everybody okay so Jesus was telling the
[1:16:14] disciple what you see there amen it is
[1:16:18] not human nobody came at night and
[1:16:21] sprayed some uh some chemical to kill
[1:16:25] the tree no
[1:16:27] faith can kill a tree
[1:16:31] [Music]
[1:16:34] what you saw is a result of what
[1:16:38] that's why he say have water in who God
[1:16:44] in other words I'm teaching you a lesson
[1:16:46] if you want to do what I just did there
[1:16:49] is one thing to do have water faith in
[1:16:52] God
[1:16:55] the disciples say okay so what is the
[1:16:58] next tree I'm gonna try Jesus say that
[1:17:02] was an example
[1:17:04] amen okay let me show you what that
[1:17:08] faith can also do
[1:17:10] we okay verse 23 for water
[1:17:14] verily I say unto you that water
[1:17:18] whosoever shall send Twitter
[1:17:21] Jesus remove it from the tree into the
[1:17:24] mountain
[1:17:26] because if he says tree the disciple
[1:17:29] will begin to hunt for trees
[1:17:31] he said let me let me show them that the
[1:17:35] same thing that can be applied to a tree
[1:17:38] you can you can change direction it's
[1:17:41] like a cannon you can turn it and give
[1:17:43] him a different Target
[1:17:45] and you send him where you want him to
[1:17:47] go
[1:17:52] if you say to this mountain
[1:17:55] be you remove and be you cast into the
[1:17:58] sea and shall not doubt in your heart so
[1:18:03] where did that Faith came out
[1:18:09] I hope somebody is getting that
[1:18:12] so it is not the one we diagnose that
[1:18:17] it's a faith
[1:18:19] amen one is a faith
[1:18:23] but we need to know where is that safe
[1:18:25] coming from
[1:18:26] now Jesus is giving us the clear
[1:18:28] description of the location where the
[1:18:31] faith is coming from number two he says
[1:18:34] that faith is where in the heart
[1:18:39] what is in the heart
[1:18:42] we okay but shall believe that those
[1:18:45] things which he shall say come to pass
[1:18:48] he shall have
[1:18:51] whatsoever he says

[1:35:18] let's read it again now Faith is the
[1:35:22] word substances of things what hope for
[1:35:26] before I go there

[1:35:31] three parts
[1:35:33] are we okay please please follow me
[1:35:38] make not my life your life easy
[1:35:42] by following destruction
[1:35:45] the human body has a soul
[1:35:50] then he has a spirit
[1:35:54] amen then he has a body
[1:35:58] everybody okay this body has five senses
[1:36:03] everybody okay we have C
[1:36:06] we have tests
[1:36:08] we have touched
[1:36:10] we have uh smell and we have also a
[1:36:15] hearing
[1:36:17] everybody okay the spirit also have five
[1:36:20] senses
[1:36:22] amen we have conscience
[1:36:26] we have imagination and so forth
[1:36:29] everybody okay
[1:36:31] they saw we found out that it's only one
[1:36:34] it's either Faith or it's what unbelief
[1:36:39] amen but if we talking if we question
[1:36:43] we must talk about faith
[1:36:46] and I'm gonna show you if I can reach
[1:36:48] where I'm going okay when we are born we
[1:36:51] born in sin shaping iniquity with Adam's
[1:36:54] belief
[1:36:56] everybody okay but there is a time where
[1:36:59] it swap unbelief must go away
[1:37:02] and you become a believer
[1:37:04] and then Faith enter everybody okay
[1:37:07] so let's put here Faith so there is one
[1:37:11] sense
[1:37:12] let me call it this way we got so we got
[1:37:15] spirit and we got body now let's read
[1:37:18] Hebrew one uh for Hebrew 11 1.
[1:37:22] now Faith
[1:37:25] where is faith
[1:37:28] faith
[1:37:30] is in the soul
[1:37:33] everybody okay
[1:37:35] fifth is the substance of things hoped
[1:37:40] for
[1:37:41] the evidence of things not water sin C
[1:37:46] is which sense
[1:37:50] are we okay
[1:37:52] so we see that Hebrew 11 chapter 1 is
[1:37:57] dealing with an element of the Soul
[1:38:02] are we okay it's also dealing with an
[1:38:05] element of the body
[1:38:08] so we must find out what is the element
[1:38:11] of the spirit
[1:38:18] if I lost you raise your hand
[1:38:23] we get the soul we got the spirit we got
[1:38:26] the body
[1:38:27] the Bible say faith belongs to the soul
[1:38:31] the Bible said the evidence of things
[1:38:34] not so we are talking about the body
[1:38:38] the Bible That's why when brother
[1:38:40] Branham described this brother Branham
[1:38:42] say the evidence of things you have not
[1:38:45] seen test in other words brother Branham
[1:38:48] say it is the five senses but Paul
[1:38:50] picked C and put it here the site
[1:38:55] everybody good so far now let's read
[1:38:57] over again the same Passage
[1:39:00] now Faith is the substance of things
[1:39:04] water hopeful there is a word they are
[1:39:07] called hope
[1:39:12] everybody okay
[1:39:15] we already got the body let me put hope
[1:39:17] here
[1:39:20] okay let me put here see
[1:39:23] everybody okay so Hebrew 11 1
[1:39:27] is talking about your whole being
[1:39:33] Hebrew 11 1 is talking about you
[1:39:36] [Music]
[1:39:37] and it's attaching your soul
[1:39:41] your spirit and it's touching also your
[1:39:45] body
[1:39:47] have I lost anyone
[1:39:49] I'm reaping a layer buddy
[1:39:52] listen to this Lord help me
[1:39:55] brother Branham says that nowaday
[1:40:00] When you pray for anyone in a water
[1:40:04] humanistic
[1:40:08] we know that the soul
[1:40:10] is in the heart
[1:40:13] everybody okay and we know that the
[1:40:16] conscience the imagination and the and
[1:40:20] the affection all of that are found in
[1:40:22] the brain
[1:40:25] you remember you remember
[1:40:28] you remember
[1:40:29] thank you Jesus
[1:40:31] brother Branham say it
[1:40:33] even mistake
[1:40:34] we say well do what I hope you shall get
[1:40:39] it well see I'm open I'm believing with
[1:40:43] you do you see the way we talk
[1:40:48] brother I believe God will do for you
[1:40:52] hope you feel good
[1:40:54] so really you're not believing
[1:40:58] I'm trying to help you
[1:41:01] the word that you say doesn't come out
[1:41:05] just like that it is from the abundance
[1:41:08] of the that's what
[1:41:11] he said I'm hoping I'm believing with
[1:41:14] you trying to use all the water I can
[1:41:18] that is how humans when you say I'm
[1:41:21] gonna try with all my faith it shows you
[1:41:24] don't have faith
[1:41:25] if you have faith you don't try anything
[1:41:29] [Applause]
[1:41:32] everybody okay
[1:41:35] brother Branham say in the fundamental
[1:41:37] Foundation of for Faith he said remember
[1:41:40] last night the water
[1:41:42] the human and the water that's faith and
[1:41:46] the water Vision the human this is water
[1:41:49] oh
[1:41:54] don't worry let me help you out my
[1:41:56] friend
[1:41:57] in the interesting Spirit follow me
[1:41:59] carefully
[1:42:00] God has nothing to substitute faith
[1:42:06] faith is faith
[1:42:09] there is nothing you can swap for faith
[1:42:12] if you do either you have it or you
[1:42:15] don't have it
[1:42:17] Faith had no substitute
[1:42:20] hope
[1:42:24] are we together we will never
[1:42:29] take the place of water Faith so there
[1:42:33] is a clear difference between Hope and
[1:42:36] Faith
[1:42:37] but faith is the substance of things
[1:42:41] helpful let's go slowly my friend
[1:42:48] fifth is how
[1:42:50] instead how
[1:42:52] hope can never take its place hope is
[1:42:57] the substance of things hope for the
[1:43:00] evidence of fixed notes it all Faith
[1:43:02] water brother
[1:43:04] I'm not talking about faith I'm talking
[1:43:06] I'm hope I'm talking about faith
[1:43:08] hope is what

[1:43:51] son by the name of Isaac
[1:43:53] is that a problem
[1:43:59] as much as he's a father he doesn't have
[1:44:02] Isaac
[1:44:08] hope is one thing faith is another hop
[1:44:12] hops for it Faith does what has got it
[1:44:16] in other words one is imaginary

[1:44:53] saying
[1:44:55] amen is intellectual faithful and to let
[1:44:59] your faith is another name for hope
[1:45:02] [Music]

[1:47:54] how do you want me to preach this
[1:47:57] everybody okay
[1:47:59] the Bible says self is the substance
[1:48:04] because hope have no substance
[1:48:07] hope is the imagination
[1:48:11] but hope is an imagination that become
[1:48:15] crystallized into a substance
[1:48:19] but it is not yet seen by the body
[1:48:29] everybody okay everybody okay
[1:48:32] in other words you usually start first
[1:48:36] by hope
[1:48:38] then you must go by faith
[1:48:40] then faith will bring it to the human
[1:48:43] body can see it
[1:48:47] let's read the Hebrew now now Faith is
[1:48:51] the substance of things
[1:48:53] the evidence of things you have noticed
[1:49:00] everybody okay so your first Department
[1:49:03] you start with hope
[1:49:06] then you ship it towards faith
[1:49:08] and faith will bring it where you can
[1:49:12] see in other words Faith materialize
[1:49:16] [Music]
[1:49:20] Faith bring it to pass
[1:49:26] listen to this
[1:49:27] Lord help me Romans 8 24 the Bible said
[1:49:32] for we are saved by water oh
[1:49:38] the Bible said we are saved by faith
[1:49:42] it's inefficient now Paul is saying we
[1:49:45] are saved by water
[1:49:47] my brother Branham say hope is
[1:49:48] intellectual
[1:49:50] you need to read the Bible clearly
[1:49:54] please verify open Roman 8 I don't want
[1:49:58] you to think I'm reading something
[1:49:59] different open
[1:50:02] open Roman 8 please
[1:50:06] by the Kelly I'm still reading the
[1:50:08] scripture
[1:50:13] let me try it if you dare you can say
[1:50:15] Amen
[1:50:16] can you read it the Bible said we are
[1:50:19] saved by what
[1:50:23] in Ephesians the Bible said we are saved
[1:50:26] by faith
[1:50:28] and we say Amen now the Bible Paul is
[1:50:31] saying we are saved by what you need to
[1:50:33] know what kind of Hope Paul is talking
[1:50:34] about
[1:50:36] can we continue now watch what Paul says
[1:50:39] we are saved by water oh
[1:50:42] before I read this let me remind you
[1:50:45] faith is the substance of what things
[1:50:48] that are what and the evidence of things
[1:50:51] that are water in other words forever is
[1:50:55] the substance of the hope you have not
[1:50:58] seen
[1:51:02] everybody okay everybody okay Faith is
[1:51:06] the substance of something you hope but
[1:51:09] you have not seen yet
[1:51:12] they hope you have not seen yet its
[1:51:15] substance is faith
[1:51:18] is it complicated
[1:51:21] let's go back now Paul say for we are
[1:51:24] saved by water but hope that is what is
[1:51:28] not water oh so what is Paul talking
[1:51:31] about
[1:51:33] let's continue let's continue the Bible
[1:51:36] doesn't contradict itself
[1:51:39] for what a man
[1:51:41] why why does he yet hopeful
[1:51:45] are you ready but if we oh for what we
[1:51:50] want us I hope that you don't see it is
[1:51:53] called water hey so we are saved by
[1:51:56] water
[1:51:56] [Applause]
[1:52:01] if I lost you raise your hand
[1:52:03] [Music]
[1:52:06] but where if we hope for that which we
[1:52:10] have not see the hope of faith not sin
[1:52:12] is what
[1:52:13] so Paul is not talking about hope he's
[1:52:16] talking about faith a faith that have
[1:52:19] not been seen yet it is called a hope
[1:52:22] that I have not been seen yet it's
[1:52:24] called Faith then do we wait with water
[1:52:27] hey
[1:52:30] another word
[1:52:32] [Applause]
[1:52:34] you ready you ready another word when
[1:52:39] something leave the Hope Department
[1:52:42] everybody okay and get into the first
[1:52:45] Department
[1:52:47] Faith usually have something for backup
[1:52:51] it is so precious
[1:52:56] [Applause]
[1:53:02] you want me to stop
[1:53:07] faith is not just pure faith
[1:53:11] Faith inside of his software he usually
[1:53:15] have patience
[1:53:17] why because if you begin to get tested
[1:53:22] safe up and patience
[1:53:25] to quieten you down
[1:53:32] [Applause]
[1:53:38] let me explain it to you if you have a
[1:53:42] desire in your heart and you pray for it
[1:53:45] but you don't have patience you don't
[1:53:48] have faith
[1:53:49] [Applause]
[1:53:52] Hallelujah
[1:53:54] imagine the word faith doesn't only give
[1:53:58] you what you want
[1:53:59] no first one he get he first cool you
[1:54:03] down
[1:54:07] in other words faith when he entered he
[1:54:09] said what's the problem

[1:54:17] then
[1:54:19] we'll ask you
[1:54:21] you are quiet and your son is sick
[1:54:25] the reason why you quiet is not because
[1:54:27] you're strong

[2:09:18] my subject this morning
[2:09:24] [Applause]
[2:09:29] you want to go home
[2:09:31] it's the four phases of roof
[2:09:33] the seed
[2:09:35] full coverage
[2:09:37] [Applause]
[2:09:44] you want me to go or you want me to stop
[2:09:48] [Applause]
[2:09:51] you ready
[2:09:52] you ready you ready
[2:09:55] you promised me you're ready
[2:10:02] Joe you ready
[2:10:03] praise God
[2:10:05] let's go we are deep
[2:10:08] very deep in roof chapter four we're
[2:10:12] dealing with the last phase which is the
[2:10:14] rewarding of roof
[2:10:15] which roof is in the holiest getting
[2:10:18] ready to disappear
[2:10:20] everybody okay
[2:10:22] and what we're dealing with is something
[2:10:25] that must happen to the children of God
[2:10:28] before the rapture
[2:10:31] [Applause]
[2:10:33] because John said now
[2:10:37] we are sons of God and he has not
[2:10:40] appeared what we shall in other words
[2:10:42] before the translation there is
[2:10:45] something that will happen to the
[2:10:46] children of God
[2:10:51] last week we demonstrated that we
[2:10:55] usually bring out our Redemption into
[2:10:58] part
[2:10:59] number one we bring the Redemption of
[2:11:02] the Soul
[2:11:04] everybody okay
[2:11:07] and then number two we're looking for
[2:11:10] the rapture
[2:11:12] which will bring the Redemption of the
[2:11:15] body
[2:11:16] and the changes of the body
[2:11:18] amen and according to Roman it's the
[2:11:21] same spirit
[2:11:23] that Rose crashed from the dead dwelleth
[2:11:26] in
[2:11:27] it shall also do what
[2:11:29] so when you get the Holy Ghost you
[2:11:32] already have the guarantee for the
[2:11:34] translation
[2:11:36] but the problem is between your time
[2:11:39] that you got the Holy Ghost
[2:11:42] everybody okay and the time that Jesus
[2:11:46] will come you still in this earth
[2:11:51] struggling
[2:11:52] with your body and having things that
[2:11:56] need to be taken care of
[2:11:58] so is the Holy Ghost come only to
[2:12:01] Quicken your soul and stay quiet until
[2:12:05] the rapture
[2:12:06] what else can the Holy Ghost do to you
[2:12:11] be sad sealing your soul
[2:12:15] brother Branham says
[2:12:17] he says that but brother brother I'm
[2:12:20] saying and that is what's the matter
[2:12:22] with you people what is the matter with
[2:12:25] the world they are living under the
[2:12:27] water because they think when they were
[2:12:30] born again
[2:12:34] people in position for every Divine
[2:12:39] promise the water God made so when you
[2:12:41] receive the Holy Spirit you are studying
[2:12:46] it is the beginning
[2:12:49] of your new exploration
[2:12:59] when you were born the one that was
[2:13:02] working on you is your human part
[2:13:05] your God
[2:13:07] seething you was always laying dormant
[2:13:09] when the Holy Spirit Come he will awaken
[2:13:14] the seed and that seed is awake now it
[2:13:18] is a New Journey for your seed to begin
[2:13:21] to experience the Natural Things of this
[2:13:25] world
[2:13:29] father help your children
[2:13:33] that's why John said beloved
[2:13:37] those that are in Christ

[2:13:40] the wife of God
[2:13:42] I wish above water of things that you

[2:46:00] the devil had got a hold of many things
[2:46:02] in our lives

[2:46:51] and you care us for every aspect of
[2:46:54] their lives
[2:46:55] father you heard their prayer
[2:46:58] you heard the expression of the desire
[2:47:00] of the heart
[2:47:02] harder long and they are looking at you
[2:47:05] because you are the author and you are
[2:47:08] the finisher of that faith you're the
[2:47:11] one that sparked that faith in our heart
[2:47:13] and you're the one that take us all the
[2:47:15] way and you're the one that give
[2:47:17] patience to endure because you don't
[2:47:19] want us to lack anything
[2:47:21] father may they take those words that
[2:47:23] was spoken May the Holy Spirit continue
[2:47:26] to water yes continue to unfold continue
[2:47:29] to strengthen continue to reveal more
[2:47:32] and more until father they will reach
[2:47:36] that point where they see clearly what
[2:47:39] you're trying to tell the church and
[2:47:41] which stage you're trying to bring them
[2:47:43] in Father may you bless each one those
[2:47:46] that are here and those that are
