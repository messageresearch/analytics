TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[bell] [music] Sister Lily, Sister Bridgen, I don't see Brother Michael and then Sister Yok. If I forget you, Sister Charlene and everything, I understand it's the devil. Amen. When I wake up this morning, I tried to move something and he goes boom. I say, "Oh my god." I say, "I'm drinking water." Like Sister Rosemary say I know if I say something wrong. Uh because she want my kidneys to be uh fine. Flash completely. I say, "Where is this thing coming up?" I say, "You know what? I'm going to start praying. I'm going to pray and I'm going to go to church &gt;&gt; and I'm here and I'm fine and completely here. &gt;&gt; [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when you sick and you can stay home, I understand that that's no problem. You can stay home. If you're sick, you can stream. Amen. But be careful. &gt;&gt; I wanted to avoid this. This is not a rebuke. Uh let me let me clarify this because I know this is not a rebuke. &gt;&gt; Whoever stay at home that was legitimate. &gt;&gt; Even brother Micah who's at home. Brother Micah this is legitimate. &gt;&gt; Ah so let's remove the devil. Whoever sister bridging it to everybody that was legitimate. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Because you got a conscience. You don't want to get give it to somebody else and things like that and we appreciate it. No problem. Amen. But let me balance uh uh things uh a little bit a different way. Amen. So don't go with a gun to a sister or whoever was not there. You are already immune. You are vaccinated. Are we &gt;&gt; you taking my time? We need to go to the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So all of you are vaccinated and you are immune. If somebody come to you just give me a call. &gt;&gt; We clear so far? &gt;&gt; We clear so far. But I just felt from the Holy Ghost that I need to say this &gt;&gt; that sometime you need to be careful &gt;&gt; when you sick. Where do you go? &gt;&gt; To the hospital. &gt;&gt; Do you worry about the nurse getting your sickness? &gt;&gt; No problem with those that stays. Do you worry about the security guy getting sick? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Do you worry about the doctor getting sick? You are you are you you have enough faith &gt;&gt; to believe that when I'm getting to the hospital, &gt;&gt; I will be free, but nobody will get sick. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; It is okay to go to the hospital &gt;&gt; when you don't feel all right. &gt;&gt; Some of you are afraid. William Marion Brham. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. The Bible, brother Brham says in the principles of divine healing, he said the first thing a person does when they get what to say maybe around home you have a few remedies and thing you try. &gt;&gt; Some have ginger. Are we together? Some have Advil code and sness. &gt;&gt; Some have all type of a a a a a small pharmacy &gt;&gt; that you have at home and you go quickly or benadril or whatever. It's all right. &gt;&gt; OH, YOU DON'T WANT TO SAY AMEN. &gt;&gt; BROTHER SAID THE FIRST THING WHEN YOU GET SICK, WHAT DO you do? Go to your home pharmacy. So everybody should have a pharmacy at home. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Where you keep your vicks and uh &gt;&gt; have I say something wrong? &gt;&gt; Uh you're not helping me. &gt;&gt; You need to go open up your cabinet and get a Tylenol &gt;&gt; and get a Advil &gt;&gt; because God heals by medicine. &gt;&gt; Now, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Thank you very much. [laughter] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRHAM SAY THE NEXT THING. &gt;&gt; When we say the next thing, it means your ginger didn't work. &gt;&gt; It means your magic solution didn't work. &gt;&gt; Have I say something wrong? &gt;&gt; If not, we continue. We close. We go straight to the brother. Brother said in OTHER WORDS IF YOUR STUFF DOESN'T WORK &gt;&gt; if your taleno your robbitum &gt;&gt; your day quill &gt;&gt; your n YOUR TERRA FLU &gt;&gt; YOUR TUMMY FLU &gt;&gt; ALL YOUR FLU medication [laughter] &gt;&gt; if it doesn't work &gt;&gt; what should we do with your brand brother Brham said the next thing is maybe you do What? &gt;&gt; Call your doctor. &gt;&gt; SO THERE IS NOTHING WRONG ABOUT GOING to the hospital. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Uh he say YOU CALL YOUR DOCTOR. THAT IS a what &gt;&gt; sensible thing to do. &gt;&gt; So it's normal, it's reasonable &gt;&gt; for you to call the doctor. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So I'm giving you faith for your medication. Faith for the doctor right there. &gt;&gt; But I'm going to move to a faith to a different realm. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say, "AND IF THE DOCTOR can do you no good." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then you got a RIGHT TO GO TO WHO? &gt;&gt; GOD. &gt;&gt; THAT IS WHAT YOU SHOULD DO. CALL ON WHO? &gt;&gt; GOD. &gt;&gt; And God IS THE AUTHOR OF WHAT? &gt;&gt; CIRCUMSTANCE. &gt;&gt; He can do what nothing else can do. WHEN MAN COMES TO THE END OF THEIR LAND, God can too. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you sick, get your medication at home. If you sick, GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. If you seek, go to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRHAM SAYS in the message, it is I be not afraid. AND NOW YOU CRY. THE SENSIBLE THING, the what? &gt;&gt; Reasonable thing. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU GET SICK IS GO TO WHO? &gt;&gt; The doctor. &gt;&gt; That is right. When your doctor fails, then you say, "I got to go somewhere else." &gt;&gt; SO THERE IS NOTHING WRONG GOING TO THE HOSPITAL. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT THE RAPTURE IS APPROACHING. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; THE RAPTURE IS APPROACHING AND AS THE RAPTURE IS APPROACHING OUR FAITH NEED TO be higher. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; THAT'S IT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S IT. COME ON. COME ON. &gt;&gt; WHEN you go get uh your terra flu, do you spend money? &gt;&gt; When you go to the emergency room, you know why you crying in the emergency room? Yes. &gt;&gt; You're not crying for the medication. &gt;&gt; You crying for for what is going to follow &gt;&gt; two weeks &gt;&gt; after your visit. &gt;&gt; YOU CRYING FOR $2,000 THAT IS COMING in the mail. BUT THERE IS ONE THAT CAN HEAL YOU [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; WITHOUT A PENNY &gt;&gt; BECAUSE BY HIS TRAP YOU WERE HERE. [applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? [cheering] &gt;&gt; I am not rebuking anyone. &gt;&gt; I am I told you I have to preach [music] 10. &gt;&gt; I won't stay with YOU IN SIX. I HAVE TO PUSH you all the way to 10 all the way to what this message is supposed to produce. [cheering] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; HOW MANY PEOPLE WANT TO GO TO the rapture? &gt;&gt; Now listen to brother Brham. Brother Brham is saying this. Brother Brham say I truly believe when &gt;&gt; before &gt;&gt; not after &gt;&gt; before the church can have what? &gt;&gt; The rapture. WE GOT TO HAVE water &gt;&gt; rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; WE CAN'T EVEN HAVE FAITH FOR DIVINE HEALING &gt;&gt; LET ALONE WATER &gt;&gt; RAPTURING FAITH. &gt;&gt; SO DIVINE HEALING IS ELEMENTARY FAITH. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Don't worry. Don't worry. Even if you don't want to climb, I will put uh something and then go and pump you up until you continue to go up. Are we together? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY BEFORE YOU EVEN GET TO RAPTURING FAITH, &gt;&gt; divine healing must be normal. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; That's correct, brother. &gt;&gt; I know. I know very well. And we will continue with faith because we stop in faith. I know. Exactly. Brother Brham say got to have a faith that shall change what &gt;&gt; and quicken this body &gt;&gt; and what &gt;&gt; be taken away. How can you believe your body can be changed? &gt;&gt; Do you think it's an easy thing? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says, he says, I believe there is a church &gt;&gt; on its road tonight, &gt;&gt; a power of what? &gt;&gt; The living God &gt;&gt; that [cheering] man will do what? &gt;&gt; Speak the word. &gt;&gt; Where? &gt;&gt; Here and there. &gt;&gt; AND IT SHALL FLASH LIKE WATER. &gt;&gt; LIGHTNING. &gt;&gt; NOT GOD SPEAKING THE WORD. YOU SPEAKING THE WORD. &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; NOT GOD. YOU TALKING &gt;&gt; LIFE AND DEATH IS WHERE? &gt;&gt; IN THE POWER OF THE TONGUE. &gt;&gt; WHO TONGUE? &gt;&gt; William Marion Brham. GLORY TO GOD. BROTHER BRHAM SAID, "BUT LOOK FRIEND, THE TIME IS COMING &gt;&gt; THAT WINTER IS DOING WHAT? &gt;&gt; It's rising up a church. IF WE CAN'T HAVE FAITH for what &gt;&gt; divine healing, &gt;&gt; HOW ARE WE GOING TO HAVE FAITH FOR THE RAPTURE? IF YOUR FAITH IS ALWAYS your remedy, &gt;&gt; if your faith is always urgent care, &gt;&gt; if your faith is always the hospital, &gt;&gt; WHICH DAY IT'S A SENSIBLE THING TO DO, &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO CLIMB &gt;&gt; TO A FAITH THAT YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND YOU SAY, "HEADACHE, MOVE &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; YES SIR. &gt;&gt; Without medication, &gt;&gt; WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT MOTIN AFFECTING MY KIDNEYS, WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT TYLENOL AFFECTING MY LIVER, &gt;&gt; A MEDICATION WITHOUT SIDE EFFECT. &gt;&gt; Are we together?
