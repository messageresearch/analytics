[48:36] exodus chapter 25.
[48:39] whoever is working on the computer just
[48:41] be really tight with the screen
[48:44] because we need everything to be
[48:47] lined up
[48:49] somebody told me say make sure you have
[48:52] enough fuel stay up there in the air
[48:55] so if i can't see the airport
[48:59] you need to blame that person
[49:04] amen
[49:05] i won't tell you his name
[49:09] but it's beautiful when everybody is
[49:11] thinking about the word and this one is
[49:13] picking up something this one is sending
[49:15] me a text this one doesn't understand
[49:18] anything all of that makes it beautiful
[49:20] amen
[49:21] exodus chapter 25
[49:26] and the lord spoke to
[49:28] moses everything we're going on now
[49:32] is building from the liver
[49:35] amen
[49:36] we're still connected to the liver
[49:39] the liver send us into the good
[49:41] samaritan
[49:43] and we we seen the priesthood in the
[49:46] level and then we move on into the good
[49:48] samaritan to see the high priest there
[49:51] now we're back again and it's the lever
[49:53] that is keep opening all of this stuff
[49:56] here so if you miss what we have been
[49:59] teaching all this time you're going to
[50:01] get in trouble amen
[50:04] and the lord spoke to moses saying
[50:07] speak to the children of israel that
[50:10] they bring me an offering
[50:12] of every man that give it willingly with
[50:16] his heart you shall take my offering
[50:20] you might be seated brother david can
[50:22] you boost me up a little bit
[50:24] can you imagine god is asking you for an
[50:26] offering
[50:29] i thought god own everything
[50:32] he even own you
[50:33] whether you like it or not whether you
[50:36] realize it or not
[50:38] he is your creator the bible said the
[50:40] heaven and earth everything belonged to
[50:42] him and that great being is coming down
[50:45] and say
[50:46] i need an offering
[50:48] what do you want
[50:50] this offering is coming from the
[50:52] children of god amen
[50:55] verse three and this is the offering
[50:58] which you shall take of them
[50:59] so not any kind of offering
[51:02] because at the beginning cain went and
[51:05] did his own thing
[51:06] everybody
[51:07] and brought the wrong offering able went
[51:10] and brought the offering
[51:12] with revelation so now god is playing
[51:15] he's speaking clearly this is the kind
[51:17] the only problem god is requiring here
[51:19] is make sure you're giving the offering
[51:22] willingly not like somebody's forcing
[51:24] you but you need to come out of your
[51:26] heart that's the way you should give
[51:28] your offering that's the way you should
[51:31] give your building fund that's the way
[51:33] you should be giving your tithing
[51:35] with a willing heart then god will bless
[51:37] you if you don't do it that way and you
[51:40] are doing it because of duty or because
[51:43] you are afraid god will whoop you
[51:45] then you don't have a revelation yet
[51:47] anybody care
[51:49] verse 3 and this is the offering which
[51:52] you shall take of them
[51:55] gold
[51:56] now you understand chapter 26 now
[51:59] right
[52:00] if you read it you will understand
[52:02] and silver
[52:04] and brass
[52:05] you can understand chapter 26
[52:08] and blue
[52:11] is it clicking now
[52:12] did you read your bible on 26
[52:15] karma and what
[52:17] you remember

[52:20] and purple and what
[52:22] you remember chapter 26
[52:24] amen and water

[52:29] everybody clear now if you didn't read
[52:31] it you're going to get lost amen
[52:33] and goat's hair you remember chapter 26
[52:37] and rem skin die red you remember
[52:39] chapter 26
[52:41] and bad your skin you remember chapter
[52:43] 26 about here
[52:47] oil for the light
[52:49] spices for the anointing oil and for
[52:52] sweet incense
[52:53] onyx town
[52:55] my god
[52:56] onixton and stone
[52:59] to be set in the effort and in the
[53:01] breastplate
[53:03] this is what god asked for what are you
[53:06] going to do with this god
[53:09] what are you going to do with this
[53:10] offering
[53:11] verse 8 and let them make me a
[53:15] sanctuary
[53:16] so the offering god was looking for was
[53:19] for the building of the sanctuary
[53:22] he said let them make me a sanctuary
[53:25] that i may dwell among
[53:28] them so there is something in god here
[53:32] that he was not satisfied to be the way
[53:35] he was
[53:36] amen
[53:38] because he was the pillar of fire
[53:40] and after a while he was not satisfied
[53:43] to stay in the state he wasn't in
[53:46] so god long
[53:48] to dwell
[53:49] among his people
[53:51] but he doesn't want to dwell any kind of
[53:54] way and back here god wanted to dwell in
[53:58] a certain type of a house
[54:01] not any kind of house
[54:03] it have to be a specific house
[54:05] built with specific material
[54:08] not any kind of material do i m that
[54:11] material have to be a certain kind of
[54:13] material
[54:15] hallelujah
[54:16] verse 8 9 verse 9
[54:19] according to all that i showed you you
[54:22] remember this now after the pattern of
[54:25] the tabernacle and the pattern of all
[54:28] the instruments thereof even so shall
[54:31] you make it so he went into the mountain
[54:34] god gave him a movie
[54:36] he looked at the movie he seen something
[54:38] in heaven god said this is my habitation
[54:41] in heaven i want you to copy that and to
[54:44] bring it back down here but when you do
[54:46] it here on the earth
[54:48] i don't want you to build it any kind of
[54:50] way
[54:51] everybody here even though you have the
[54:54] plan if and though you have everything
[54:56] that has been set up in heaven i want
[54:58] you to build it with a certain type of
[55:01] material
[55:02] not just going and pick up concrete and
[55:05] begin to build it no i don't need
[55:07] concrete the concrete will go with
[55:09] solomon
[55:10] not you
[55:12] hallelujah
[55:14] let's go to acts chapter 7.
[55:18] lord help us
[55:21] just be calm
[55:22] you'll be all right
[55:26] amen
[55:27] amen
[55:29] hallelujah
[55:31] act chapter 7 verse 44. if you're there
[55:34] you can say amen
[55:35] [Music]
[55:38] our father had the tabernacle of witness
[55:43] the first dwelling place of god
[55:46] was a tabernacle
[55:48] hey
[55:50] in the wilderness
[55:52] in exodus our father had a tabernacle of
[55:56] witness in the wilderness
[55:58] as he has appointed
[56:00] speaking to who
[56:02] this tabernacle was built by moses
[56:09] hallelujah
[56:11] amen
[56:13] that he should make it according to the
[56:16] fashion that he had seen everybody clear
[56:18] now we're coming from 20 uh exodus 25
[56:22] you can see it here verse 45
[56:24] which also our fathers
[56:27] that came after
[56:28] brought in with jesus that name jesus is
[56:32] joshua
[56:33] everybody
[56:34] in other words moses built the
[56:36] tabernacle in the wilderness
[56:38] and then moses died and we know the
[56:40] mystery about his death his resurrection
[56:43] and god took him everybody but the
[56:45] tabernacle remained and joshua picked up
[56:48] that tabernacle and entered with that
[56:51] tabernacle into the promised land that's
[56:53] what stephen is explaining here he said
[56:56] verse 45 which also our fathers that
[56:59] came after brought in with jesus meaning
[57:01] joshua
[57:03] into the possession of the gentile
[57:06] whom god drove out before the face of
[57:09] our father to the days of david in other
[57:12] words we stay with this tabernacle from
[57:15] the time of moses all the way to david
[57:18] you know why david right we went through
[57:21] this verse 46
[57:23] david who found favor before god
[57:26] and desire to find a tabernacle for the
[57:30] god of jacob so that if it was not
[57:32] pleased with that tabernacle he want to
[57:34] build a temple anybody care
[57:37] but
[57:38] solomon built him a house so we moved
[57:42] right here from the tabernacle
[57:45] into the house or the temple
[57:50] the temple was built by solomon
[57:54] so the first dwelling place of god is a
[57:56] tabernacle built by moses then from the
[57:59] tabernacle god moves into a temple which
[58:03] is a more a stronger structure everybody
[58:05] clears so far verse 47 but solomon built
[58:09] him a temple a house
[58:11] however
[58:15] who built this tabernacle
[58:18] was moses a human being
[58:20] who built this tabernacle
[58:23] was solomon a human being
[58:26] who asked
[58:28] the people to build the tabernacle
[58:32] who gave
[58:33] david the inspiration to build the
[58:36] temple
[58:38] who did it it's god
[58:42] hallelujah
[58:44] however
[58:45] verse 48
[58:47] the most high
[58:49] america the most high who dwell in the
[58:52] tabernacle
[58:53] the most high who dwell in the temple
[58:56] the most high who requested
[58:59] to have a house
[59:01] and they built the house for him
[59:03] however
[59:04] even though the inspiration came from
[59:07] him
[59:08] everybody
[59:10] however
[59:11] the most high dwells not
[59:15] in temple made with water
[59:22] that's why you need a prophet
[59:24] anybody here
[59:26] anybody here
[59:27] did god dwell in the tabernacle
[59:30] yes did god dwell in the temple
[59:32] but god is saying he doesn't dwell in
[59:34] the tabernacle made with him
[59:40] you see now
[59:42] he said here he said here it's a
[59:43] contradiction what are you going to do
[59:45] with this amen
[59:47] however the most high dual not in tempo
[59:50] made with hand as says the prophet
[59:54] why heaven is my throne
[59:57] and earth is my footstool what house
[1:00:01] will you build me
[1:00:03] what house
[1:00:05] who gave the instruction about the
[1:00:07] material god
[1:00:09] what house will you build god
[1:00:12] amen
[1:00:13] says the lord oh what is the place of my
[1:00:16] water
[1:00:17] so by house god was looking for a rest
[1:00:26] i thought god rested on the seventh day
[1:00:28] when he when he made the heaven and
[1:00:30] earth
[1:00:33] he was not resting
[1:00:36] god was trouble
[1:00:40] amen
[1:00:41] what is the place of my rest
[1:00:44] verse 50 has not my hand made all these
[1:00:48] things
[1:00:49] i am the one who created all of this
[1:00:51] i am the one who told you to build me a
[1:00:53] temple you built me a temple i lived
[1:00:55] there however
[1:00:59] that is not my perfect will
[1:01:03] is it clear now
[1:01:05] that is not really my perfect way
[1:01:07] however amen
[1:01:09] this is a permissive will
[1:01:11] let's go to romans 1 then we pray
[1:01:17] hallelujah
[1:01:19] if you dare you can say amen
[1:01:23] genesis exodus 26 we got the material of
[1:01:26] the temple
[1:01:27] here we found from the tabernacle
[1:01:30] to the temple but still god is not
[1:01:33] satisfied
[1:01:34] in other words god need another temple
[1:01:40] this is temple number one
[1:01:43] this is temple number two
[1:01:45] and back here
[1:01:47] i need another temple
[1:01:49] but make sure this temple
[1:01:52] we don't have input from human beings
[1:01:56] i don't want a human being to bring
[1:01:58] anything
[1:02:00] back here i don't need your concrete i
[1:02:03] don't need your offering i don't need
[1:02:05] anything from you
[1:02:07] that's the temple i want to do early
[1:02:08] ever here
[1:02:10] roman 1
[1:02:11] verse 20. if you dare you can say amen
[1:02:14] for the invisible things
[1:02:17] of
[1:02:18] who the invisible thinks of god
[1:02:22] the invalid the invisible things of him
[1:02:25] from the creation of the world
[1:02:28] are clearly seen how do you see it
[1:02:32] things are invisible how do you see it
[1:02:34] karma
[1:02:35] being understood
[1:02:38] by the things that are water
[1:02:40] so god
[1:02:42] in himself have things that are
[1:02:45] invisible
[1:02:46] and god himself is invisible
[1:02:49] everybody and paul is saying that
[1:02:52] the invisible things of god are seen
[1:02:56] through the things that are visible
[1:02:59] everybody
[1:03:00] so not only do you see them
[1:03:03] everybody care
[1:03:05] but you also understand them
[1:03:10] anybody here so if you don't have a clue
[1:03:14] what is god
[1:03:15] you need to look at some material amen
[1:03:19] we okay
[1:03:20] that material
[1:03:22] is telling you god
[1:03:27] are we okay i'm just helping you
[1:03:30] everybody here
[1:03:31] so if this is a material
[1:03:34] if you look at this you should see god
[1:03:38] and you should understand god
[1:03:41] just by looking at nature
[1:03:45] in other words when you look at the tree
[1:03:48] the tree is talking
[1:03:52] the tree have a message
[1:03:55] the tree is reflecting something
[1:03:59] that was originally invisible
[1:04:03] and if you get the revelation of the
[1:04:05] tree
[1:04:06] you will see god
[1:04:08] anybody here
[1:04:10] so the invisible things of him from the
[1:04:13] creation of the world are clearly seen
[1:04:16] being understood by the things that are
[1:04:19] made
[1:04:21] even his eternal what
[1:04:24] how can you understand the power of god
[1:04:29] how
[1:04:30] god said to understand my power look in
[1:04:33] nature
[1:04:34] you're going to see my power amen
[1:04:36] even his eternal power and water
[1:04:41] in other words the attributes of god
[1:04:45] are we okay
[1:04:46] are also displaying material
[1:04:51] we okay
[1:04:53] so if you look at the material clearly
[1:04:56] you can see god being expressed through
[1:04:58] that
[1:05:01] i hope you understanding where i'm going
[1:05:04] anybody
[1:05:05] even his eternal power and godhead so
[1:05:09] that they are without excuse
[1:05:13] so even if you never read the bible
[1:05:15] before
[1:05:16] if you look at nature
[1:05:19] you will see god
[1:05:20] anybody
[1:05:22] that's why people wanted to worship god
[1:05:25] and they didn't have the revelation and
[1:05:28] they begin to come up with ideas
[1:05:30] one say maybe he looks like this maybe
[1:05:33] he looks like a bear maybe he looks like
[1:05:35] an iron because they knew somehow they
[1:05:38] got to be a power that is orchestrating
[1:05:40] everything here but how to decode the
[1:05:44] material
[1:05:45] and to see god through a material
[1:05:48] that's the problem let's pray
[1:05:52] heavenly father
[1:05:53] lord we are approaching you humbly again
[1:05:55] father this morning thanking you for
[1:05:58] your grace your love and your mercy and
[1:06:00] for everything you have been doing for
[1:06:02] us father i have done what any man that
[1:06:05] you give ability to do can do by your
[1:06:09] grace and this is where i can stop but
[1:06:12] where when it comes to interpreting your
[1:06:14] word and to bring a revelation to your
[1:06:17] children it is only an action of the
[1:06:20] holy spirit father may you move me
[1:06:22] completely out of the way may you speak
[1:06:24] to your children this morning may you
[1:06:27] neutralize and destroy every kind of
[1:06:30] sickness every virus
[1:06:33] whether they call it kovid or or macron
[1:06:36] or whatever
[1:06:37] father in your presence those things
[1:06:39] cannot stand if somebody came that has
[1:06:42] been exposed or something father may you
[1:06:44] heal them by the power of the holy
[1:06:46] spirit may the devil and his entire army
[1:06:49] be completely out of this place and may
[1:06:52] only the holy spirit come down and
[1:06:55] further shower the blessings of
[1:06:56] redemption upon your children in the
[1:06:59] name of jesus christ
[1:07:01] amen
[1:07:02] god bless you
[1:07:05] hope you're staying awake
[1:07:08] when we were dealing with the mystery of
[1:07:10] deliver
[1:07:12] we were in exodus chapter 40.
[1:07:16] devil really at this time
[1:07:18] wasting time we were in exodus chapter
[1:07:21] 40
[1:07:22] and the bible say and that shall anoint
[1:07:26] the letter
[1:07:27] and his foot and sanctify it
[1:07:31] and that shall bring aaron you
[1:07:33] understand this language now because we
[1:07:35] went through this and his son
[1:07:38] unto the door of the tabernacle of the
[1:07:40] congregation and wash them with water
[1:07:46] this water was not just regular water
[1:07:49] anybody care
[1:07:51] it was a water from an anointed level
[1:07:55] and right here in other words it was an
[1:07:57] anointed water
[1:07:59] anybody care so far
[1:08:01] john 3 verse 5 jesus said and jesus
[1:08:04] answered verily verily i say unto thee
[1:08:08] except a man be born of water
[1:08:11] everybody here there and off the water
[1:08:14] everybody there
[1:08:15] he cannot enter into the kingdom of god
[1:08:19] that's why the lever must be anointed
[1:08:21] first
[1:08:23] to represent the holy ghost and then the
[1:08:25] water is there so now it's the water and
[1:08:28] the holy ghost mixing together that's
[1:08:31] the water you wash the high priest and
[1:08:34] his children
[1:08:35] anybody care so far
[1:08:37] and then dasha put upon aaron the holy
[1:08:41] garment
[1:08:42] we already talked about aaron we already
[1:08:44] found out our high priest that our high
[1:08:47] priest is the lord jesus christ and
[1:08:49] aaron we found out that he was washed by
[1:08:51] moses
[1:08:52] but we have not gotten into who washed
[1:08:54] jesus christ
[1:08:56] about here
[1:08:58] now you shall put upon the air on the
[1:09:01] holy garment
[1:09:03] what is a holy garment
[1:09:05] it's very easy to read and to pass
[1:09:07] through say okay they watch aaron and
[1:09:10] then they put a holy garment
[1:09:12] what is that holy garment
[1:09:14] anybody care
[1:09:15] and anoint him
[1:09:18] and sanctify him in other words
[1:09:19] consecrate him that he may minister unto
[1:09:22] me in the priest office and that shall
[1:09:25] bring his sons remember now the high
[1:09:28] priest and his son melchizedek our high
[1:09:30] priest and his son and clothe them with
[1:09:34] coat
[1:09:35] right here it says the high priest have
[1:09:38] holy garment plural
[1:09:42] and the sounds which are plural have
[1:09:45] coats
[1:09:47] what is the difference
[1:09:48] between a holy garment
[1:09:50] and a coat
[1:09:51] about here
[1:09:52] because i can tell you your high priest
[1:09:54] you already know him it's the lord jesus
[1:09:56] christ that is clear no problem amen so
[1:09:59] what is the garment that they're going
[1:10:01] to put on jesus christ
[1:10:03] before they anoint him
[1:10:06] because the first high priest they pull
[1:10:08] him they wash him
[1:10:10] after finishing washing him they put a
[1:10:12] garment on him and they anointed him and
[1:10:15] they brought his children they washed
[1:10:17] them put a garment on them and anointed
[1:10:20] them and the anointing represented the
[1:10:23] holy ghost everybody know that anybody
[1:10:25] here so when we brought jesus christ who
[1:10:28] wash him
[1:10:30] what kind of garment did they put on
[1:10:32] jesus christ
[1:10:34] and what kind of anointing did jesus
[1:10:36] receive
[1:10:37] everybody
[1:10:39] if the high priest is having a holy
[1:10:41] garment
[1:10:42] his son are not having holy garment
[1:10:46] but they have in courts
[1:10:48] what is the difference between a holy
[1:10:49] garment and a court
[1:10:52] to understand this
[1:10:56] we need to go back in the temple
[1:10:59] amen now buckle up as we begin to
[1:11:01] clamber
[1:11:02] everybody here i need your undivided
[1:11:05] attention anybody here so far so when we
[1:11:08] look at the tabernacle here
[1:11:11] everything in the tabernacle
[1:11:14] doesn't have life
[1:11:19] everything
[1:11:20] that made the tabernacle
[1:11:22] was just material without life
[1:11:26] everybody here
[1:11:27] we got clothing we got wood we got gold
[1:11:32] we got brass and everything there is no
[1:11:34] life
[1:11:35] if i bring gold here and i put it here
[1:11:38] that gold will stay here without moving
[1:11:41] anybody
[1:11:42] the only
[1:11:43] thing that had life
[1:11:46] in the tabernacle
[1:11:48] was the pillar of fire
[1:11:50] everybody here and the priest that were
[1:11:54] entering in
[1:11:56] everybody here
[1:11:57] to do the service of the tabernacle
[1:12:00] the tabernacle itself was made out of
[1:12:03] material physical material and the
[1:12:06] tabernacle have to be carried by
[1:12:08] somebody and move and pitched
[1:12:11] and organized everybody
[1:12:13] but the only living thing that was
[1:12:16] living in the tabernacle was the pillar
[1:12:18] of fire or the priest that entered every
[1:12:22] day and the high priest that were moving
[1:12:24] left and right they were the only living
[1:12:27] people everybody
[1:12:29] so we also knew when we look at the
[1:12:32] priesthood that the priest himself was a
[1:12:35] tabernacle
[1:12:37] you remember that
[1:12:39] because the tabernacle have how many
[1:12:41] portals
[1:12:43] three parts what is it
[1:12:45] the court
[1:12:47] the holy place
[1:12:50] and the holiest anybody care and as
[1:12:53] human beings how many parts do we have
[1:12:56] the body
[1:12:58] their the spirit
[1:13:00] and the soul
[1:13:02] so we are all temples
[1:13:04] we are all tabernacle anybody here but
[1:13:08] when you look at the human tabernacle
[1:13:10] the human tab and alcohol wear clothes
[1:13:16] the high priest have clothing
[1:13:19] everybody
[1:13:21] the sons of the high priest have also
[1:13:23] clothing
[1:13:24] everybody
[1:13:25] and the tabernacle itself have clothing
[1:13:31] are we okay
[1:13:32] are we okay
[1:13:34] hallelujah and if you notice the
[1:13:37] clothing of the high priest this is a
[1:13:40] physical material no life this is human
[1:13:43] the clothing of the high priest look
[1:13:46] like the clothing of the tabernacle
[1:13:53] because when we are born
[1:13:55] we are born with our clothing
[1:13:58] somebody must take clothing and put on
[1:14:00] us
[1:14:01] here and the tabernacle when you examine
[1:14:04] the tabernacle you look at the material
[1:14:07] of the tabernacle it looks like the
[1:14:09] clothing that the priests are wearing
[1:14:14] anybody okay
[1:14:15] so to understand the clothing of the
[1:14:18] high priest
[1:14:21] to understand the clothing of the priest
[1:14:24] or the sons of the high priest
[1:14:27] you must understand the clothing of the
[1:14:30] tabernacle first
[1:14:33] anybody okay
[1:14:36] god
[1:14:37] our subject
[1:14:39] is the tabernacle's curtains
[1:14:44] not one curtain
[1:14:46] but many curtains
[1:14:48] if you read exodus 26 you'll find this
[1:14:51] curtain of fine liner
[1:14:53] you find the goat hair
[1:14:55] you find the rem skin and you find the
[1:14:57] badger skin all of that covered the
[1:15:00] tabernacle
[1:15:03] anybody okay
[1:15:05] all right brother branham said god can't
[1:15:08] give a first revelation
[1:15:11] then a second revelation
[1:15:13] if he did he will be changing his mind
[1:15:17] he can give a revelation
[1:15:20] then do whatever
[1:15:22] add to it
[1:15:24] as he did in the garden of eden when he
[1:15:27] promised the seed to the woman and then
[1:15:29] later designated that seed had to come
[1:15:32] through abraham and then later said it
[1:15:35] will come to a blood line in water
[1:15:39] so the more information god gives you
[1:15:43] the more specific
[1:15:45] what he's telling you is clearly seen
[1:15:50] if they say a virgin shall conceive
[1:15:53] which virgin
[1:15:55] many people are virgins
[1:15:56] here but if he said bethlehem now it's
[1:16:00] not in every city we need to go back in
[1:16:02] bethlehem about here so it's more it
[1:16:05] brings everything to a convergence so
[1:16:08] that you can see exactly what he's
[1:16:10] talking about
[1:16:11] brother branham said when he added to it
[1:16:13] he said it was the same revelation
[1:16:16] but he only gave the people more water
[1:16:20] to help them do water
[1:16:23] and water
[1:16:24] so when god gives more revelation
[1:16:28] of when god gives more instruction
[1:16:32] it is not to worry with you
[1:16:35] anybody care
[1:16:36] when god gives more detail
[1:16:40] the details of god
[1:16:42] are not to
[1:16:45] make you tired
[1:16:47] the detail of god
[1:16:49] are to help you
[1:16:51] understand what he's saying
[1:16:54] and recognize what he's trying to do
[1:17:00] anybody care
[1:17:01] so when god say four qubit
[1:17:04] five cubit
[1:17:05] he's saying something
[1:17:07] and but here the problem is we do not we
[1:17:10] do not understand how to decode that but
[1:17:13] behind the numbers
[1:17:15] behind the material
[1:17:17] behind the people behind everything that
[1:17:21] is in the scripture there is a message
[1:17:25] everybody okay so far
[1:17:27] where are we going my brother we found
[1:17:30] that in eternity
[1:17:33] eternity was filled with the spirit of
[1:17:36] god
[1:17:38] god filled the spirit completely because
[1:17:40] what branham said he was this fountain
[1:17:43] of seven colors of the rainbow anybody
[1:17:45] care so far
[1:17:47] then we already explained it to you that
[1:17:48] god immorphy
[1:17:50] or changed from this and god shrank
[1:17:53] himself
[1:17:54] into a light
[1:17:56] that was called the pillar of fire
[1:17:59] anybody care
[1:18:00] what is this light the pillar of fire
[1:18:03] stay awake please
[1:18:05] in psalm
[1:18:07] chapter 104 verse 1 and 2 the bible say
[1:18:11] bless the lord
[1:18:13] o my soul
[1:18:14] o lord my god
[1:18:17] they are very great
[1:18:19] they are clothed with water
[1:18:22] and water
[1:18:24] can you see honor
[1:18:27] can you see majesty if i tell you show
[1:18:29] me majesty what is majesty
[1:18:31] what is honor
[1:18:33] is still invisible
[1:18:35] everybody
[1:18:36] but the invisible attribute of god
[1:18:40] are understood by the things that are
[1:18:43] visible
[1:18:45] did that lose anybody
[1:18:47] did that lose anybody
[1:18:49] hallelujah
[1:18:51] defeat continue he said who conferenced
[1:18:55] that self
[1:18:56] with what
[1:18:58] can you see light
[1:19:00] there is a light here
[1:19:01] can you see light there is a light right
[1:19:03] here if you go outside the sun is
[1:19:05] shining you can see the light now it's a
[1:19:08] little bit more clear
[1:19:10] anybody here
[1:19:11] who covered that self
[1:19:13] with light as a garment so the first
[1:19:17] government god used was the pillar of
[1:19:20] fire
[1:19:27] everybody okay
[1:19:29] anybody okay
[1:19:30] so god veiled himself oh the spirit of
[1:19:34] god fell itself
[1:19:36] in a light
[1:19:38] because god is a spirit and nobody can
[1:19:41] see a spirit
[1:19:42] when you say god where is god
[1:19:44] now god there himself in a light
[1:19:48] so when you see the light moving you
[1:19:50] know that inside the light god is there
[1:19:53] anybody here that's why when paul was
[1:19:56] going on the road to damascus the pillar
[1:19:59] of fire met him and that pillar of fire
[1:20:01] was talking
[1:20:03] there was somebody inside the pillar of
[1:20:05] fire that could talk to paul
[1:20:08] everybody okay so the first garment of
[1:20:11] god was a pillar of fire which we
[1:20:14] already know we went through many times
[1:20:16] was the logos
[1:20:19] or the theophany
[1:20:22] everybody okay
[1:20:24] in daniel chapter 2 verse 22
[1:20:27] he revealed the deep and secret things
[1:20:31] he know if what is in the darkness and
[1:20:34] delight dwell with him
[1:20:37] that's the first garment of god anybody
[1:20:40] care
[1:20:41] in the garden of eden
[1:20:43] we found god living there
[1:20:45] when he lived there he was still in the
[1:20:47] pillar of fire at the end of the day he
[1:20:50] comes and talked to adam and he
[1:20:52] continued all adam and eve can tell you
[1:20:55] if you say where's your god they say
[1:20:57] wait in the evening how is it he's like
[1:21:00] a light that is moving you will see the
[1:21:03] light that him if you stay with adam
[1:21:05] after a while adam would say come come
[1:21:07] come look at that light that's him he's
[1:21:09] coming and he comes adam adam how are
[1:21:12] you doing how was your day today when
[1:21:14] you look it's a light blazing everybody
[1:21:17] here
[1:21:19] then he called abraham
[1:21:21] when he met abraham at least through
[1:21:23] abraham
[1:21:24] this light here in more fair into a man
[1:21:30] anybody care
[1:21:32] but the material of that man
[1:21:34] was still a light
[1:21:36] and that man was called melchizedek
[1:21:42] america
[1:21:43] so when abraham saw him he saw a man
[1:21:45] walking
[1:21:46] he said oh that's finally god
[1:21:49] so bring food
[1:21:51] you want to give mercy that food he said
[1:21:53] i don't eat this
[1:21:55] i can give you food you cannot give me
[1:21:57] food
[1:21:59] everybody
[1:22:00] it's only in genesis 18
[1:22:03] when melchizedek came
[1:22:05] he fabricated a human being
[1:22:09] are you following me
[1:22:10] and mercy zedek entered the human being
[1:22:13] and went to abraham
[1:22:16] when abraham cooked he said give it to
[1:22:18] me i can eat now
[1:22:19] because i have a body on top of my body
[1:22:24] anybody okay
[1:22:26] we found out that this right called the
[1:22:29] pillar of fire
[1:22:31] paul says in festivity he said that that
[1:22:35] keep this commandment with that spot
[1:22:38] unrebukable until the appearing of our
[1:22:41] lord jesus christ because when paul
[1:22:44] spoke to the light he said who are you
[1:22:46] and the light answer and say this is
[1:22:49] jehovah
[1:22:51] no the light says this is oh
[1:22:53] so jesus was speaking in the light
[1:22:56] everybody
[1:22:58] and until the appearing of our lord
[1:23:00] jesus christ which in his time
[1:23:04] he shall show who is the blessed
[1:23:07] and the only potent
[1:23:10] the king of kings
[1:23:11] and the lord of lord
[1:23:13] who only has immortality that
[1:23:16] melchizedek everybody care
[1:23:19] dwelling in the water
[1:23:21] we already seen that
[1:23:24] in the light
[1:23:25] which no man can approach
[1:23:31] even though
[1:23:32] god veil himself in the garment
[1:23:35] when you try to approach him he says
[1:23:37] stay away
[1:23:39] amen
[1:23:41] i'm going slowly
[1:23:42] it's a light
[1:23:44] but it's a light that you cannot touch
[1:23:48] are we okay
[1:23:49] it's a light that you cannot approach
[1:23:53] when you talk to him you must stay away
[1:23:56] i thought he was my friend
[1:23:59] i thought he wanted fellowship
[1:24:02] you need fellowship
[1:24:03] i come to your house you say thank you
[1:24:05] for your fellowship but stay there
[1:24:08] how are you doing
[1:24:09] i'm doing okay
[1:24:11] how was your day do you like the
[1:24:13] fellowship
[1:24:14] that was the fellowship
[1:24:17] god long to have a family
[1:24:19] god long to have friends god loves to
[1:24:23] have children his children are up
[1:24:26] and he fill himself with a light that
[1:24:28] when you approach say stand back
[1:24:31] stay there
[1:24:33] go ahead and talk what do you want
[1:24:35] you say i taught you my father
[1:24:37] he said yes i'm your father but you stay
[1:24:39] away there
[1:24:40] hallelujah
[1:24:42] he dwell in a light which no man can
[1:24:45] approach
[1:24:47] whom no man has seen
[1:24:49] nor can see to whom be honor and power
[1:24:53] everlasting amen
[1:24:55] we found out that when his children were
[1:24:58] in egypt
[1:24:59] and he came to rescue the children
[1:25:02] he met moses
[1:25:05] the bible said in exodus 3 and the angel
[1:25:08] of the lord
[1:25:09] appeared unto him in the flame of fire
[1:25:12] out of the midst of the bush and he look
[1:25:16] and behold the bush was burning with
[1:25:18] fire and the bush was not consumed
[1:25:21] and moses said
[1:25:23] i would turn aside and see this great
[1:25:25] sign why the bush is not burned
[1:25:28] it's a fire but when it gets into the
[1:25:31] bush it doesn't burn the bush
[1:25:33] what kind of fire is this one moses
[1:25:35] turned he said i never seen this before
[1:25:38] there is no smoke the fire is there and
[1:25:41] the bush is intact
[1:25:43] let me approach and see who is this fire
[1:25:46] embark here
[1:25:48] and when the lord saw
[1:25:50] that he turned aside to see he begin to
[1:25:53] get interested in the things of god
[1:25:56] god call unto him out of the midst of
[1:26:00] the bush and say
[1:26:01] moses
[1:26:02] moses and he say here am i
[1:26:05] and he said
[1:26:07] draw water
[1:26:10] stay away
[1:26:13] i'm coming down to talk to moses
[1:26:16] you did the supernatural and moses so
[1:26:19] moses said okay he want to talk to me
[1:26:21] say stay away
[1:26:23] what kind of light is this amen
[1:26:26] joe not nigh he'd
[1:26:28] put off that shoe from off that feed for
[1:26:31] the press wear on that standard is holy
[1:26:34] ground
[1:26:35] because i came down in this mountain i
[1:26:38] already changed this mountain here
[1:26:40] anybody here matter of fact take your
[1:26:42] shoes away and stay away from there i
[1:26:45] just want to talk to you but you cannot
[1:26:47] approach me
[1:26:49] cares so far
[1:26:51] even when he met israel at mount sana
[1:26:55] god gave the instruction
[1:26:58] because he lives
[1:27:00] in a garment
[1:27:01] in the light
[1:27:03] that no man can approach
[1:27:06] i hope you follow him
[1:27:08] amen
[1:27:10] in exodus 19 verse 11
[1:27:12] the bible say and be ready against the
[1:27:15] third day for the third day the lord
[1:27:18] will come down
[1:27:19] in the sight of all the people upon
[1:27:22] monsanto
[1:27:23] god told moses i want to talk to my
[1:27:26] children consecrate them
[1:27:28] clean them up in three days i want to

[1:34:25] egypt and i have heard their groaning
[1:34:28] and i am come down to deliver them and
[1:34:31] now come i will send you into egypt
[1:34:35] this is the moses which said unto the
[1:34:38] children of israel a prophet shall the
[1:34:41] lord your god raise up unto you of your
[1:34:45] brethren like unto who
[1:34:47] he him shall you heal
[1:34:50] and this is he that was in the church in
[1:34:53] the wilderness
[1:34:55] what i want you to see here
[1:34:57] is when israel was in egypt
[1:35:01] god called them my people

[1:35:17] god told moses i want to dwell among you
[1:35:21] anybody care
[1:35:23] i see you having skin
[1:35:26] i see you with hair

[1:35:36] god say you want to see me

[1:35:45] moses said i saw him he looks like a
[1:35:47] back of a man but you cannot approach
[1:35:49] him the man moses saw was melchizedek
[1:35:54] everybody cares so far
[1:35:56] so now god is tired of staying in the
[1:36:00] light
[1:36:03] he said i am among my children
[1:36:06] but they cannot approach me i am too
[1:36:09] supernatural

[1:36:16] i don't have a clothes beside this light
[1:36:19] i wanna be clothed
[1:36:20] [Music]
[1:36:22] and god gave a promise
[1:36:25] through moses he said one day
[1:36:29] the lord your god
[1:36:32] will send you a prophet
[1:36:35] do you follow me
[1:36:37] that prophet is god
[1:36:40] but it's gonna be a prophet that look
[1:36:43] like you
[1:36:47] it's gonna be a god that you can talk to
[1:36:52] a god that can eat
[1:36:55] a god that can cry
[1:36:58] a god that can run
[1:37:01] a god that is 100 percent human
[1:37:06] [Music]
[1:37:09] everybody okay
[1:37:11] but before that god come
[1:37:14] let me already start dwelling
[1:37:17] just like you i see you l are wearing
[1:37:19] clothing
[1:37:21] your clothing is material
[1:37:23] this is silk
[1:37:25] this is what let me see this this is
[1:37:27] wool
[1:37:28] i don't have wool
[1:37:30] can you please
[1:37:31] make me a a a tent
[1:37:36] do you follow me
[1:37:38] can you make me a body
[1:37:41] can you people fabricate me a body
[1:37:45] that i'm gonna step in
[1:37:46] i know it's not time for me to be
[1:37:49] manifested in flesh yet
[1:37:52] anybody okay
[1:37:54] but at least i can't wait till that time
[1:37:57] it is taking too long
[1:38:00] please give me something now
[1:38:02] that i can feel a little bit comfortable
[1:38:06] everyone here
[1:38:07] so when you touch that thing you touch
[1:38:09] me
[1:38:13] are you following me
[1:38:15] are you following me
[1:38:17] if god dwell in a human being
[1:38:20] if you touch that human being you touch
[1:38:22] god
[1:38:23] but that promise was way down in the
[1:38:26] future
[1:38:27] and god said it is taking too long
[1:38:30] please fabricate me something
[1:38:33] that i can get in and when i'm dwelling
[1:38:36] in that thing if you touch that you
[1:38:38] touch me
[1:38:40] because when god dwells
[1:38:44] in the burning bush
[1:38:46] he told moses take your
[1:38:49] shoes off
[1:38:50] everything here change
[1:38:51] and back here when he dwell in the
[1:38:54] mountain
[1:38:55] he said not everybody touch
[1:38:58] this mountain now is charged differently
[1:39:01] anybody here i don't want to dwell in
[1:39:03] the mountain anymore i don't want to
[1:39:05] dwell again into a light anymore
[1:39:08] fabricate me a temporary body now
[1:39:12] that at least i can enjoy myself
[1:39:15] to be among you
[1:39:17] everybody okay so far
[1:39:20] hallelujah
[1:39:22] that happened when israel became the
[1:39:25] church brother branham said god
[1:39:27] has always
[1:39:30] in every age
[1:39:32] has hid behind the air
[1:39:35] all ages
[1:39:36] but he's been god all the time but he's
[1:39:40] kept himself
[1:39:42] hid from the world
[1:39:44] and reveal himself to his elect
[1:39:47] like the apostle and that day
[1:39:49] now that was god speaking in christ
[1:39:52] now man
[1:39:54] has always it's been the nature of a man
[1:39:58] he sought to see physically
[1:40:01] the god amen
[1:40:03] god
[1:40:04] want to dwell with human being human
[1:40:07] being is trying to see how god look like
[1:40:10] hey but here
[1:40:11] he always wanted to see it
[1:40:14] man has made creatures that look like
[1:40:17] him
[1:40:18] they think the indian worshiped the sun
[1:40:21] the african different form of animals
[1:40:24] they told them paul in alaska and
[1:40:26] different from
[1:40:27] that they think this god is
[1:40:30] as paul spoke there at athens that time
[1:40:33] on mars here and told them that they
[1:40:36] were superstitious concerning this
[1:40:38] unknown god they know he was there but
[1:40:41] yet they didn't know him
[1:40:44] everybody okay so far
[1:40:46] blessed be the name of the lord then
[1:40:48] being the church of god not the people
[1:40:51] of god
[1:40:52] god ordained a certain place for these
[1:40:56] people to meet in where they will be
[1:40:59] fellowship
[1:41:00] because god longs to fellowship with his
[1:41:03] people and among his people
[1:41:06] then god took moses up in the mountain
[1:41:09] of fire where the lightning was flashing
[1:41:12] and the thunder roaring and he showed
[1:41:14] him what kind of a dwelling place he
[1:41:17] desire to dwell in on earth for moses
[1:41:21] pattern the earthly tabernacle after
[1:41:24] what he has seen in heaven a sanctuary
[1:41:27] of the lord
[1:41:28] oh i think that is so beautiful to think
[1:41:31] that god before he would let a church
[1:41:34] building be built
[1:41:36] that that building had to be pardoned of
[1:41:39] his heavenly abode
[1:41:41] moses made all things after the pattern
[1:41:44] of the heavenly everybody okay
[1:41:47] now we're gonna drop there
[1:41:50] when moses made
[1:41:53] first he made the tabernacle anybody
[1:41:55] care
[1:41:56] then later on
[1:41:58] moses move on and we found that solomon
[1:42:01] built the temple everybody okay
[1:42:04] in exodus chapter 40 the bible says this
[1:42:09] in verse 33 so moses finished the work
[1:42:13] of the tabernacle then a cloud cover the
[1:42:17] tent
[1:42:18] of the congregation and the glory of the
[1:42:21] lord filled the tabernacle
[1:42:25] if you look
[1:42:26] on the first tabernacle
[1:42:29] everything was single
[1:42:32] i'm going down
[1:42:33] deeper
[1:42:35] they only had one altar
[1:42:38] everybody okay
[1:42:40] one eleven anybody okay
[1:42:43] one
[1:42:45] candlestick everybody okay
[1:42:48] one ark everything was one one one one
[1:42:51] one and they finished the tabernacle
[1:42:53] everybody care
[1:42:55] and when they dedicated that tabernacle
[1:42:58] the only person that was ministering at
[1:43:02] the dedication was one man
[1:43:05] his name was moses
[1:43:08] amen are we okay
[1:43:10] everything in the tabernacle involves
[1:43:14] one person
[1:43:16] even
[1:43:17] for the atonement
[1:43:19] in the year
[1:43:20] only one high priest
[1:43:22] have to enter that's a
[1:43:25] not too high priest
[1:43:27] everything in the tabernacle was won
[1:43:32] everything in the tabernacle spoke about
[1:43:36] number one
[1:43:37] everybody okay so far
[1:43:39] hallelujah and then moses was not able
[1:43:43] to enter into the tent of the
[1:43:45] congregation
[1:43:47] because the cloud above their own and
[1:43:49] the glory of the lord filled their
[1:43:51] tabernacle the one who was prevented to
[1:43:54] enter was only one man because the only
[1:43:57] one who can approach god was moses
[1:43:59] everything in the tabernacle won
[1:44:03] we clear now
[1:44:05] what is going on when we move into the
[1:44:08] temple of solomon
[1:44:10] in the time and i call each only moses
[1:44:12] we found that the tabernacle the temple
[1:44:16] involved many people
[1:44:20] hallelujah
[1:44:21] in fact in ii chronicle chapter 5 the
[1:44:24] bible says on the day of the dedication
[1:44:27] of the temple
[1:44:28] that delivered which were single all of
[1:44:32] them are self of assaf of heaven of
[1:44:35] genitum with their sons and their
[1:44:37] brethren being arrayed in white linen we
[1:44:41] get that later having symbols and sultry
[1:44:44] and harp
[1:44:45] stood at the east of the end of the
[1:44:47] altar
[1:44:48] and with them a water
[1:44:51] and water
[1:44:53] sanding the water
[1:44:55] in the dedication of the tabernacle we
[1:44:58] only have one man moses
[1:45:01] at the dedication of the temple how many
[1:45:04] priests did we have
[1:45:10] are you there
[1:45:12] in the tabernacle one
[1:45:15] candlestick
[1:45:17] if you go in the scripture in the temple
[1:45:20] they had ten
[1:45:22] candidates
[1:45:24] in the top and ankle they have one level
[1:45:27] in the temple of solomon they have ten
[1:45:31] it looks like the temple of solomon
[1:45:34] is multiplying the tabernacle
[1:45:38] amen
[1:45:40] everybody okay
[1:45:42] hallelujah the bible says it came even
[1:45:46] to pass
[1:45:47] as the trumpeter and the singer whereas
[1:45:50] one
[1:45:51] in unity
[1:45:52] to make one sound to be heard
[1:45:55] in praising and thanking the lord and
[1:45:57] when they lift up their voice with the
[1:45:59] trumpet and symbol an instrument of
[1:46:02] music and praise the lord saying for his
[1:46:04] good for his mercy endure forever then
[1:46:07] the house was filled with a cloud even
[1:46:11] the house of dog
[1:46:13] in other words the same scenario that
[1:46:15] happened in the tabernacle happened now
[1:46:18] in the temple but in the tabernacle when
[1:46:21] it happened the bible say moses could
[1:46:23] not minister one man
[1:46:26] anybody okay but when it happened in the
[1:46:30] temple the bible says that the priest
[1:46:33] no more one man could not stand to
[1:46:36] minister by reason of the water for the
[1:46:40] glory of the lord has filled the water
[1:46:42] in the tabernacle everything was worn
[1:46:46] but in the temple
[1:46:48] it was
[1:46:50] 120 people
[1:46:52] and on the day of pentecost
[1:46:55] everybody okay when the holy ghost came
[1:46:59] and filled the temple
[1:47:02] how many people were there
[1:47:04] in other words the temple of solomon
[1:47:08] represent the bride
[1:47:10] [Applause]
[1:47:10] [Music]
[1:47:13] and the tabernacle of moses represented
[1:47:20] christ did i lose anybody
[1:47:23] in the tabernacle everything is single
[1:47:27] it is christ himself
[1:47:29] we okay
[1:47:30] in the temple the christ is multiplied
[1:47:34] it is no more one priest moses
[1:47:37] but now it is 120 priests
[1:47:40] [Music]
[1:47:43] everybody okay
[1:47:44] everybody okay
[1:47:46] the material of the tabernacle came from
[1:47:50] one nation
[1:47:52] from the jews only
[1:47:53] but the material of the temple came from
[1:47:57] many nations
[1:48:00] [Applause]
[1:48:05] hallelujah
[1:48:06] the bible said the house when he was
[1:48:09] building was built of stone made already
[1:48:12] before he was brought to the so that
[1:48:14] there was needed water
[1:48:17] no
[1:48:18] no any tool of iron heard in the house
[1:48:22] while he was let in water so when they
[1:48:24] were building the temple of solomon they
[1:48:27] didn't use a hammer
[1:48:29] everything was precise but everything
[1:48:33] came from different nations when they
[1:48:35] bring it from africa
[1:48:37] when they bring it from america when
[1:48:39] they bring it from asia when they put it
[1:48:42] together it fits perfectly

[1:48:53] america
[1:48:54] people from africa people from jamaica
[1:48:58] people from trinidad
[1:49:00] people from zimbabwe in one church and
[1:49:04] they all fit together
[1:49:06] and no problem among them
[1:49:09] [Applause]

[1:49:22] brother branham say
[1:49:24] we can all drink
[1:49:26] from this fountain we can all drink
[1:49:28] together and i'm so happy for this and
[1:49:31] believing that someday that god will
[1:49:34] bring us all together
[1:49:37] all people
[1:49:39] of our denomination
[1:49:41] god's work
[1:49:42] in one great ransom church
[1:49:45] you know solomon temple when he was cut
[1:49:48] out it was cut out in different parts of
[1:49:50] the world
[1:49:51] the trees the cedar of lebanon flooded
[1:49:55] down to joppa and from there to oxgarde
[1:49:58] to jerusalem and so forth and the
[1:50:00] stonemason in the years of cutting the
[1:50:03] different stone they shaped different
[1:50:05] way but when they come together there
[1:50:08] was not a freakstone among them every
[1:50:11] stone laid right to each water
[1:50:13] and i think that is what god is doing
[1:50:17] he's just cutting us out of the
[1:50:19] methodist
[1:50:21] out of the baptist out of the
[1:50:23] presbyterian and the pentecostal but
[1:50:26] when jesus come we shall all go stone to
[1:50:30] stone
[1:50:31] cemented with the water
[1:50:34] and god will take up his water
[1:50:37] the point i'm driving
[1:50:39] the temple of solomon is the bride of
[1:50:42] jesus christ
[1:50:43] it is god
[1:50:44] multiplied in many members
[1:50:47] and those members are coming from
[1:50:49] different countries but yet they fit
[1:50:52] together as one house of god but the
[1:50:55] tabernacle is one person and the
[1:50:58] material came from one nation and fit
[1:51:01] only one person
[1:51:02] everybody okay
[1:51:04] praise be the name of the lord did i
[1:51:06] lose somebody
[1:51:08] hallelujah
[1:51:10] but
[1:51:11] will god
[1:51:13] indeed dwell on the earth
[1:51:15] behold the heaven and the heaven cannot
[1:51:18] contain thee how much less this house
[1:51:20] that i have built
[1:51:22] the question of solomon i built a house
[1:51:25] can god really dwell in this house
[1:51:28] and brother branham say
[1:51:29] stephen spoke of solomon temple and the
[1:51:32] most high don't dwell in temple made
[1:51:35] with hands for heaven is my throne and
[1:51:38] the earth is my footstool
[1:51:39] a body has that prepared me god dwell in
[1:51:43] the stature of a man
[1:51:46] reflecting himself into that being
[1:51:49] perfect worship
[1:51:51] god in us being his tabernacle god
[1:51:54] manifesting notice that god has always
[1:51:58] at all time reflected himself in who
[1:52:04] hallelujah
[1:52:05] let's just take a look at this
[1:52:08] what moses must have saw he made it
[1:52:11] first out of earthly material which was
[1:52:14] made of water and sheepskin we call it
[1:52:18] tabernacle or tent meaning air dwelling
[1:52:21] place and in this tabernacle tent there
[1:52:24] was three separate compartment that
[1:52:26] surely is the way it is in glowing
[1:52:29] all these pointed to her
[1:52:32] and even the furniture
[1:52:34] that was inside its wall everything
[1:52:37] spoke of who
[1:52:39] that's the reason that cross in christ
[1:52:42] dwelt the fullness of god because all
[1:52:45] things led to him and christ was god
[1:52:48] manifest made flesh god tabernacle on
[1:52:52] water
[1:52:54] if this temple
[1:52:55] this tabernacle represented christ
[1:52:59] and this represented the
[1:53:02] the brother in this tabernacle we see
[1:53:06] that god told moses to get some clothing
[1:53:12] anybody care

[1:59:58] god is calling the second curtain a
[2:00:02] covering of the he didn't say cover the
[2:00:06] first curtain

[2:00:14] is what they call the tabernacle itself
[2:00:20] anybody care in other words if you want
[2:00:24] to get to the last section
[2:00:27] of this tabernacle
[2:00:29] this is the curtain you found

[2:00:33] this curtain is the tabernacle every
[2:00:37] other curtain

[2:00:46] do you follow me
[2:00:47] do you follow me
[2:00:49] god told israel
[2:00:52] make the first tabernacle
[2:00:55] then get out the curtain

[2:01:15] god
[2:01:16] give the first revelation
[2:01:21] you remember my quote
[2:01:22] but he doesn't change it then every
[2:01:25] other thing that is coming
[2:01:28] it is more information
[2:01:30] to understand the first revelation
[2:01:34] that's why the first curtain is the
[2:01:37] tabernacle everything else is just
[2:01:40] covering it
[2:01:44] did you get it did i lost someone
[2:01:48] thank you jesus when this

[2:01:58] discovering but if they ask you what is
[2:02:01] really the tabernacle it's the first
[2:02:03] layer
[2:02:05] anybody care
[2:02:07] but to understand the first layer better
[2:02:10] you need the other layer
[2:02:14] so when

[2:06:54] of israel
[2:06:56] and them was all water
[2:06:59] so can
[2:07:01] express a carnal nature
[2:07:07] everybody okay

[2:07:29] when he closed his hand
[2:07:31] so to bring a blessing
[2:07:34] out of a tenor

[2:08:30] joseph but ten is a bad number ten
[2:08:34] express the carnal nature of a man

[2:08:45] moses make me a tabernacle
[2:08:48] take 10 curtains in other words moses i
[2:08:51] am bringing a tabernacle that's going to
[2:08:55] deal with the carnal nature
[2:09:04] romans 7 verse 14
[2:09:06] for we know that the law is spiritual
[2:09:11] but i am what
[2:09:13] sold unto us
[2:09:18] number 10
[2:09:20] number 10 we are all carnal
[2:09:23] anybody here
[2:09:25] born in sin
[2:09:26] shaping iniquity coming into the world
[2:09:30] roman 8
[2:09:31] for to be carnally minded is water
[2:09:38] so 10
[2:09:40] not only is he dealing with the count of
[2:09:43] nature it is dealing with death
[2:09:48] everybody okay
[2:09:50] but to be spiritually minded is life and
[2:09:53] cast
[2:09:54] because the kind of mind is water
[2:09:59] time is a memory between you and god
[2:10:06] anybody care so bring a tabernacle
[2:10:10] that's gonna remove the enmity
[2:10:14] bring a tabernacle that's going to

[2:10:20] alcohol that's going to remove death
[2:10:22] out of my people
[2:10:28] anybody here
[2:10:30] for
[2:10:31] it is not subject to the law of god
[2:10:34] neither indeed can it be
[2:10:36] that's why he was a light that you
[2:10:38] cannot approach
[2:10:39] because your nature cannot approach him
[2:10:42] anybody care you are corner
[2:10:45] but bring me a tabernacle when that tab

[2:10:55] james ford
[2:10:57] yeah adulterer and adulteress
[2:11:00] knowing not that friendship
[2:11:03] of the world is enmity with god
[2:11:10] we were enemy
[2:11:12] with god
[2:11:13] whosoever therefore will be a friend of
[2:11:16] the world is the enemy of god
[2:11:20] he that committed sin is of the devil
[2:11:24] for the devil sinning from the beginning
[2:11:27] for this purpose the son of god was
[2:11:30] manifested
[2:11:32] that he might destroy
[2:11:34] the worker
[2:11:38] moses
[2:11:39] make 10 curtains
[2:11:41] i want to deal with the carnal nature of
[2:11:44] israel
[2:11:46] i want to remove the carnality out of
[2:11:48] israel i want to remove death from
[2:11:51] israel i want to remove enmity
[2:11:55] i'm not pleased with my people being
[2:11:58] away
[2:11:59] from me and they cannot approach me
[2:12:01] there is a nimity between me and them
[2:12:05] i don't like it
[2:12:06] i want to be a god that they can
[2:12:08] approach
[2:12:09] i want to be a god they can put their
[2:12:11] hand on i want to be a god that can
[2:12:14] understand them i want to talk to them
[2:12:17] but there is a nimity
[2:12:19] there is a death
[2:12:21] there is a counter nature that is
[2:12:23] blocking me god
[2:12:24] to approach them
[2:12:26] make me a tabernacle
[2:12:29] make me a body
[2:12:31] that's gonna take care of this problem
[2:12:34] anybody okay
[2:12:36] did i lose anybody
[2:12:39] hallelujah
[2:12:41] when you make
[2:12:42] this body
[2:12:44] when you bring in the tent curtain don't
[2:12:47] keep 10
[2:12:49] because 10 is a bad number
[2:12:51] split it in two
[2:12:52] and marquis
[2:12:54] use the number of redemption and go
[2:12:57] split the ten and two and make five
[2:13:00] and when 10 is split into it brings to
[2:13:04] grace
[2:13:06] and back here
[2:13:07] you bring your first grace and the
[2:13:10] second grace
[2:13:11] you need both grace
[2:13:13] to deal with number 10
[2:13:20] you need first grace and second grace
[2:13:23] but the first grace and the second grace
[2:13:26] is the same person
[2:13:29] [Music]
[2:13:31] it is the same tabernacle
[2:13:34] are we following
[2:13:37] hallelujah
[2:13:39] joshua here is a book
[2:13:42] a book of redemption of the old
[2:13:44] testament joshua we would have to
[2:13:47] consider it to be
[2:13:49] that the book of redemption because we
[2:13:51] dabs and had how many parts
[2:13:54] split into
[2:13:56] split the curtain into
[2:13:58] anybody here
[2:13:59] this curtain is the body that god wants
[2:14:02] to enter and live on
[2:14:04] take that body
[2:14:06] split into
[2:14:10] everybody here because redemption has
[2:14:13] two parts
[2:14:14] redemption anywhere has worked
[2:14:18] that's why they have to split into grace
[2:14:20] here
[2:14:21] that is out of
[2:14:24] and into
[2:14:26] so one grace will take you out of
[2:14:29] something
[2:14:34] do you follow me
[2:14:35] but the second grace will put you into
[2:14:38] something
[2:14:44] hallelujah
[2:14:45] he said it takes two parts
[2:14:48] to make redemption out of
[2:14:51] into
[2:14:52] moses represented the law which brought
[2:14:55] them out of egypt whereas joshua
[2:14:59] represented grace that took them into
[2:15:01] the water
[2:15:03] in other words the law and grace were
[2:15:06] two different aspects of god's command
[2:15:08] the law brought them out
[2:15:11] and joshua took them water
[2:15:13] he also represented something for water
[2:15:18] for our day
[2:15:20] for our day he represents
[2:15:23] as they were in germany coming from
[2:15:26] egypt
[2:15:27] into the promised land so have we come
[2:15:30] out of the water
[2:15:32] of water
[2:15:34] chaos
[2:15:35] on our road to the water
[2:15:38] in my father's house our many mentioned
[2:15:41] if he was not i would have water
[2:15:44] coming out and going water
[2:15:46] in other words the grass take you out
[2:15:50] from the world
[2:15:52] anybody here it is a grace that takes
[2:15:55] you out from a canadian
[2:15:58] out from the death
[2:16:00] out from the enmity
[2:16:02] and there is the grace that will put you
[2:16:05] in the promised land
[2:16:08] [Applause]
[2:16:10] everybody okay
[2:16:12] anybody okay
[2:16:13] i hope i didn't lose somebody
[2:16:16] redemption has two different parts
[2:16:19] come out of and entering into him first
[2:16:22] you have to come out
[2:16:24] some people want to bring the world in
[2:16:26] with them
[2:16:27] but you got to come out of the world
[2:16:29] you got to stop that cigarette you gotta
[2:16:32] stop that whiskey you gotta stop that
[2:16:34] fornication you gotta stop that adultery
[2:16:37] you gotta come out
[2:16:38] it take a grace to pull you out
[2:16:42] but when you are out you need the second
[2:16:45] grace
[2:16:46] [Music]
[2:16:49] anybody care
[2:16:50] anybody here
[2:16:52] you have to come out of unbelief
[2:16:55] to enter into faith
[2:16:57] there cannot be one thing in your way to
[2:16:59] you to really have genuine faith you
[2:17:02] must absolutely leave everything
[2:17:05] that is contrary to water
[2:17:08] behind to enter into water
[2:17:10] now we found out that we have to come to
[2:17:14] another vision
[2:17:16] in other emphasis now
[2:17:18] anybody here
[2:17:19] in our intellectual denomination and so
[2:17:22] forth all our education program has come
[2:17:25] to its jordan in other words its death
[2:17:28] then we must have an efficient again we
[2:17:30] must have a message
[2:17:33] coming out and going into further
[2:17:37] so one grace
[2:17:41] one five
[2:17:42] must deliver you from a sin
[2:17:46] from unbelief
[2:17:48] about here but the second grace must put
[2:17:51] you in the rapture
[2:17:58] are we okay
[2:17:59] did i lose anybody
[2:18:00] [Music]
[2:18:02] it's strange that some of you are
[2:18:03] sleeping
[2:18:05] david says this in psalm 63
[2:18:08] epsom absorbed david when he was in the
[2:18:11] wilderness of jose of judah
[2:18:13] oh god die out my god
[2:18:16] early will i seek you my water
[2:18:19] taste for thee
[2:18:21] my water
[2:18:23] longer for the in the dry and thirsty
[2:18:25] land with no water
[2:18:27] if you remember when we talked about the
[2:18:30] black dogger
[2:18:32] we found that man was made by the other
[2:18:35] man
[2:18:38] and
[2:18:39] in a man anybody care
[2:18:42] you have a black dog here

[2:18:50] do you follow me remove the black dog
[2:18:53] from the inside
[2:18:57] do you follow me
[2:18:58] but the black dog
[2:19:00] is staying on the outside
[2:19:03] you need the second grace
[2:19:07] ever here the second grace is coming not
[2:19:11] to kick the black dog on the inside
[2:19:14] because you already have a white dog
[2:19:16] there is to kick the black dog from the
[2:19:19] other man or from your body
[2:19:27] david says this that's why he said my
[2:19:30] soul
[2:19:31] is testing for thee and my flesh also
[2:19:34] you remember that
[2:19:35] my soul longeth yeah even fainted for
[2:19:39] the court of god
[2:19:40] my heart and my flesh cries out for the
[2:19:43] living god
[2:19:44] paul said in romans 7 for are delighting
[2:19:47] the law of god after the water
[2:19:51] because the inward man already received
[2:19:53] the first grace
[2:19:55] now i'm born again
[2:19:57] but still i have trouble
[2:19:59] in my body
[2:20:01] redemption is not done yet you need the
[2:20:03] second grace
[2:20:04] the second grace he comes to redeem you
[2:20:08] on your body
[2:20:09] everybody here
[2:20:10] battle scene another law in my member
[2:20:14] not on the inside man
[2:20:16] the law of sin now is on my body
[2:20:20] worrying against the law of my mind it's
[2:20:23] a war

[2:20:27] law of sin which is in my member oh
[2:20:30] righteous man that i am
[2:20:32] who shall deliver my soul
[2:20:36] because the soul is already redeemed
[2:20:40] who shall deliver am i
[2:20:42] of this water so paul is saying when you
[2:20:46] are born again
[2:20:48] on the inside you are a new creation
[2:20:53] but the outside you still have struggles
[2:20:58] still have the corner nature because you
[2:21:00] have the corner nature on the inside
[2:21:04] and on the outside
[2:21:06] the first grace take the corner nature
[2:21:08] out
[2:21:09] on the inside but the outside remain you
[2:21:13] need the second grace to remove that
[2:21:15] that's why the two grace have to be
[2:21:18] split
[2:21:20] everybody okay
[2:21:22] matthew 21 jesus said unto them did you
[2:21:26] never read in the scripture the stone
[2:21:29] which the builder rejected the same is
[2:21:32] become the head of the corner this is
[2:21:34] the lord's doing and it's marvelous in
[2:21:36] our eyes
[2:21:37] therefore say unto you the kingdom of
[2:21:40] god shall be taken from you and given to
[2:21:43] uh
[2:21:44] not many nation one
[2:21:46] the bride
[2:21:47] bringing forth the fruit water
[2:21:50] and paul explained it he said
[2:21:52] that the church is built upon the
[2:21:55] foundation of the apostle
[2:21:58] and the prophet and jesus christ himself
[2:22:01] being the water
[2:22:03] so the ministry of jesus christ
[2:22:06] that he came first on earth was a
[2:22:09] cornerstone ministry

[2:23:30] verse 10
[2:23:32] of which salvation
[2:23:34] the prophet have inquired
[2:23:36] and searched diligently
[2:23:38] who prophesied of the grace
[2:23:42] that should come unto you
[2:23:44] anybody okay
[2:23:45] peter is saying that the old testament
[2:23:48] prophet was prophesying that there was a
[2:23:50] grace that is coming up
[2:23:53] everybody here a virgin shall conceive
[2:23:55] this one said that shall i call him
[2:23:57] emmanuel uh uh i mean a prince of peace
[2:24:00] mighty god they were all prophesying of
[2:24:02] a grace that will come and that grace
[2:24:05] when he came he was expressed on jesus
[2:24:08] christ
[2:24:09] as a ministry of the cornerstone
[2:24:14] okay
[2:24:16] searching what or what manner of time
[2:24:19] the spirit of christ which was in them
[2:24:21] did signify when he testified beforehand
[2:24:25] of the suffering of christ and the glory
[2:24:27] that he should follow
[2:24:29] the prophet spoke about christ and the
[2:24:32] glory that would follow jesus christ
[2:24:35] after his death something will follow
[2:24:37] jesus christ everybody here unto whom he
[2:24:40] was revealed to those prophets that not
[2:24:43] unto themselves but unto us they did
[2:24:46] minister defense which are now reported
[2:24:49] unto you by them that have preached the
[2:24:51] gospel unto you with the holy ghost sent
[2:24:53] down from heaven which thing the angel

[2:24:58] so peter is saying there was a grace
[2:25:00] that was prophesied even the angel
[2:25:03] themselves wanted to see their grace
[2:25:06] and when digress came we already know
[2:25:08] about it it came in the man called jesus
[2:25:11] christ

[2:48:05] brother branham took the second portion
[2:48:09] the scripture has been split in two
[2:48:12] one has a jubilee
[2:48:15] and that jubilee is not a jubilee of a
[2:48:18] priest

[2:48:47] you are not feeding on my word you're
[2:48:49] feeding on god there is a divine element
[2:48:54] a 50 golden element
[2:48:56] that makes the ministry of bodhibranam
[2:49:00] and the ministry of jesus christ one
[2:49:03] what makes them one is the deity element
[2:49:07] the golden ring
[2:49:09] that bring the two jubilee together

[3:00:18] go home and review this
[3:00:20] let's pray
[3:00:21] heavenly father
[3:00:23] lord we thank you again father for your
[3:00:25] grace
[3:00:26] for your love and for your mercy
[3:00:29] father
[3:00:30] who can unfold this kind of stuff
[3:00:33] but only you
[3:00:35] never and will never have anything to do
[3:00:38] with me father
[3:00:39] it is you the almighty god
[3:00:42] that heed these things in the scripture
[3:00:44] and because of the opening of the seals
[3:00:47] father you drop an anointing that is
[3:00:50] making the bible a new book
[3:00:52] and it's bringing us to fall more and
[3:00:55] more in love with you because without
[3:00:57] you we can do nothing
[3:00:59] father thank you for sending us this
[3:01:01] second grace lord
[3:01:03] thank you for opening these numbers lord
[3:01:06] whoever was in struggle now they can see
[3:01:08] perfectly the mathematics of god father
[3:01:11] you came with a second jubilee lord no
[3:01:14] wonder your prophet could come and
[3:01:16] preach the year of jubilee because that
[3:01:18] jubilee was a golden jubilee it was not
[3:01:22] a jubilee that was given by an old
[3:01:23] priest but it's the high priest himself
[3:01:26] after the order of melchizedek that is
[3:01:29] bringing that jubilee to free your
[3:01:31] children from any captivity
[3:01:33] father many are here and many are also
[3:01:36] streaming online
[3:01:37] i don't know who is in a captivity
[3:01:39] father but you know who is struggling in
[3:01:41] his body
[3:01:43] who is struggling with a certain
[3:01:44] weakness
[3:01:45] maybe to women
[3:01:47] maybe it's proud maybe it's stubbornness
[3:01:50] maybe it's ignorance maybe father it's a
[3:01:54] dominating spirit
[3:01:55] maybe it's a sickness somewhere maybe
[3:01:58] it's not a female trouble maybe it's a
[3:02:01] complex or a depression father but
[3:02:03] whatever it is even those that have been
[3:02:06] exposed to kovid father there is no
[3:02:09] mountain that can stand between before
[3:02:11] is a robber
[3:02:12] they all will become a plane father
[3:02:15] praying and sending the jubilee lord of
[3:02:18] this message under the name of jesus
[3:02:21] christ that you free your children this
[3:02:24] morning from every demonic
[3:02:26] bondage that the devil have brought upon
[3:02:29] them
[3:02:30] father may you bring deliverance not a
[3:02:33] man deliverance but a divine deliverance
[3:02:36] because who that you set free father
[3:02:38] shall be free indeed lord we thank you
[3:02:41] for the grace you have given us lord to
[3:02:43] even reach this point we are committing
[3:02:45] one another unto the hand may look god
[3:02:48] do you continue to unfold your word to
[3:02:50] your children and bless us out together
