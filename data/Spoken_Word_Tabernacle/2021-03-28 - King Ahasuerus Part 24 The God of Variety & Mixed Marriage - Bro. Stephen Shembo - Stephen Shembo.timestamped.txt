[52:42] amen and those that have their gift
[52:44] already activated
[52:46] you're going to be seeing something more
[52:48] clear and clear
[52:50] and clear and clear either you take part
[52:53] of it or you're going to be a spectator
[52:55] i don't want to be a spectator i want to
[52:57] be right in the middle of it
[53:00] amen let's go to isaiah chapter 3. we
[53:03] read this last week could not even get
[53:05] into it
[53:07] amen my god
[53:10] i wish the entire church was here
[53:14] because i'm going to lay a principal
[53:16] here that's going to help you up through
[53:18] all the avenues of the black dog
[53:21] amen yeah i could continue
[53:24] we we stopped at their pants at the eyes
[53:28] how many listen to that sermon okay
[53:31] praise god
[53:32] yeah if i continue the devil might make
[53:35] you struggle a little bit so let's lay
[53:37] down the foundation
[53:39] so you understand everything will blend
[53:41] into what we're going to speak
[53:43] amen isaiah chapter 3.
[53:49] there is something that those who are
[53:52] going to stay in tune with catching
[53:59] and when you catch it it's going to help
[54:02] you
[54:03] get that road easy because i can't speak
[54:06] that on youtube
[54:08] before brother robert put me in order
[54:11] [Laughter]
[54:15] he's usually the one that put me in the
[54:16] order in that one amen
[54:20] praise be the name of the lord remember
[54:22] we have the building fund today
[54:24] the building fund offering at the end of
[54:26] the service
[54:28] we are overdue for our house meeting
[54:31] so you need to start working on your
[54:34] question and answer
[54:35] there are certain question and answer
[54:36] answered is somebody who asked me a
[54:38] question i told him to
[54:39] make a time to talk to me because i
[54:42] cannot answer that
[54:44] over the phone or through texting i want
[54:46] to go through but what i'm going to lay
[54:49] down today is going to
[54:50] automatically help you up i can preach
[54:53] it here i'm not
[54:54] afraid of it but brother spoke about it
[54:57] but there are certain things that are
[54:58] going to be
[54:59] local i am not an international pastor
[55:04] amen the ministry is for the broad
[55:08] international
[55:10] but the office is local amen
[55:13] yeah if i preach that the way i see it
[55:17] before i leave here the links are will
[55:20] fly away
[55:24] but i will nail it with the scripture
[55:26] amen
[55:29] so some of those questions we gotta talk
[55:32] somebody asked me last week i believe
[55:35] if we can put a theme to
[55:38] our titles on youtube so i would talk to
[55:42] brother david
[55:43] in other words we're going through part
[55:45] 23 24 25 and we keep going
[55:48] but sometimes if you want to go back and
[55:50] refer to
[55:51] certain things that we spoke you have to
[55:54] search it all around
[55:56] so what they asked me see they say but
[55:58] stephen if there is a possibility
[56:00] maybe uh part 23 you can call it
[56:04] nail and high heel so when you
[56:07] put that team there
[56:09] [Laughter]
[56:13] don't worry my brother
[56:16] don't worry my sister just stay in tune
[56:19] we're going to help you out
[56:20] i i just came nailing high heels amen
[56:23] so when you're searching for some quotes
[56:26] or
[56:26] some scripture about it instead of going
[56:28] through 10 sermons you can go straight
[56:30] ahead and say
[56:31] the team is there this is what we talk
[56:33] about all this is about the black dog or
[56:35] something like that it would take a
[56:36] little time but brother david
[56:38] can work it up everybody clear
[56:41] i hope i didn't scare somebody
[56:44] isaiah 3 we're going back to the
[56:47] foundation of the fathers
[56:50] you don't want power without character
[56:53] isaiah 3 verse 8.
[56:56] sorry just understand me you feel better
[56:58] to be here
[57:02] you don't know what i was feeling at
[57:04] home and how i'm feeling now
[57:07] completely here amen
[57:10] blessed be the name of the lord verse 8
[57:12] for jerusalem
[57:14] is roon and judah
[57:17] is fallen because their tongue
[57:20] and their doings are against the lord
[57:23] that's why they're failing
[57:25] to provoke the eyes of his glory
[57:29] verse 9 they show off their countenance
[57:32] in other words if you look at the look
[57:34] of their face
[57:35] that's weakness against them and they
[57:39] declare
[57:40] they're seen as sodom right here you can
[57:42] see that the scene of sodom
[57:44] was not a scene that was done in secret
[57:47] it was done
[57:48] publicly like i say back in the day when
[57:51] somebody was homosexual they used to
[57:53] hide
[57:54] they don't want anybody to know but now
[57:56] transgender homosexual they don't hide
[57:58] nothing they're just coming up straight
[58:01] ahead and this is fulfilling the
[58:03] prophecy
[58:04] amen they hide it not
[58:08] in other words they're not even ashamed
[58:09] of it they think it's normal and they
[58:12] want to poke that normality
[58:14] in our children in our wives in our
[58:17] family
[58:18] but we refuse it because it's against
[58:21] the word of god
[58:24] amen i'm not refusing it because it's my
[58:28] opinion
[58:29] we need to make a difference with that i
[58:32] am not against it because it's my
[58:34] preference
[58:35] i am not against it because it's against
[58:37] my feeling
[58:38] i am against it because it's against the
[58:41] world
[58:43] amen once you zero everything to the
[58:46] word to the message of the hour
[58:48] then that word will be above your
[58:50] feelings
[58:51] above your preference above your opinion
[58:55] because some people take their opinion
[58:57] about the word of god
[58:59] their only vindicated opinion is the
[59:02] opinion
[59:03] of brother branham
[59:08] not your opinion only the message of the
[59:10] hour
[59:11] because he's god's mouthpiece
[59:14] everybody clear verse 16 moreover the
[59:18] lord said because
[59:19] the daughter of zion can you imagine i
[59:23] was at home i
[59:24] i took a drink to get some energy
[59:27] and the drink caused me more trouble now
[59:30] i'm thirsty
[59:32] [Laughter]
[59:34] let me drink water
[59:39] that devil don't worry the black dog
[59:43] moreover the lord said because the
[59:45] daughters of zion you might be seated
[59:49] those daughters are hardy you know what
[59:51] it means they are proud
[59:54] and walk we've stretched forth next
[59:57] so there is something that make this
[1:00:00] daughter of
[1:00:01] zion walk differently there is something
[1:00:04] that the daughter of zion have that make
[1:00:07] their
[1:00:08] neck being outstretched
[1:00:13] i hope you're going to open your heart
[1:00:15] and be humble enough to
[1:00:19] release whatever you have as a right
[1:00:23] and let the world change you amen
[1:00:26] if not he's going to bump and go back
[1:00:28] again
[1:00:29] but he will not return void when he
[1:00:32] bumps against you he goes back
[1:00:33] it turns into judgment everybody clear
[1:00:39] and stretch forth their next and one
[1:00:42] turned
[1:00:42] eyes in other words seductive eyes
[1:00:46] we talked about that last week i'm going
[1:00:48] to start from there and take off
[1:00:50] what makes the eye seductive
[1:00:53] everybody clear walking and messing
[1:00:57] as they go how can somebody without
[1:01:00] shoes
[1:01:00] walk and mess or twist no there is
[1:01:03] something
[1:01:04] that is making this woman twisting
[1:01:08] that's in between the land it takes a
[1:01:10] profit to reach out to that and pull it
[1:01:13] out
[1:01:14] amen and messing as they go
[1:01:17] and making a tinkling with their
[1:01:20] feet if you take your shoes off and you
[1:01:24] walk here sister even if you walk on a
[1:01:26] parking lot are you going to make noise
[1:01:29] no there is something that if you put
[1:01:31] while you're walking
[1:01:32] it's going to make noises you will hear
[1:01:36] kaka
[1:01:38] and the second thing will be the
[1:01:40] bracelet of the ankle
[1:01:44] it's in description amen
[1:01:48] let's go to first thessalonians 5.
[1:01:54] we under the territory of the black dog
[1:01:58] just bear with me once we finish this
[1:02:01] then we're going to stop
[1:02:02] backing up to the surface
[1:02:07] first thessalonians 5 22 you should be
[1:02:10] even remembering this
[1:02:14] everybody clear you there
[1:02:19] verse 21 prove water
[1:02:22] are you proving all things how do you
[1:02:25] prove all things
[1:02:27] what is your caliber what is your
[1:02:30] measurement
[1:02:32] it's strange you're telling somebody i
[1:02:34] do everything by the way they say well
[1:02:36] do you tell me you do everything by the
[1:02:37] word
[1:02:38] yes yes
[1:02:42] prove all things hold fast
[1:02:45] that which is what so if it's not good
[1:02:48] what do you do to it
[1:02:50] put it in the trash
[1:02:53] let it go verse 22
[1:02:56] abstain from all appearance of water
[1:03:01] so god does not want you to look like
[1:03:04] evil what
[1:03:07] determines what is evil and what is not
[1:03:10] evil
[1:03:11] because when you are living in your old
[1:03:14] life
[1:03:15] you thought what you were doing were
[1:03:17] good
[1:03:18] it took the light of the world to show
[1:03:21] you that what you were doing was evil
[1:03:24] so the one determining what is evil is
[1:03:28] not you
[1:03:29] it is the word it is the message of the
[1:03:32] hour
[1:03:32] that's going to tell you what is evil
[1:03:35] and what is not evil
[1:03:36] because that is god provided way for the
[1:03:39] day
[1:03:42] amen let's go to hebrew chapter 11 then
[1:03:46] we're going to pray
[1:03:49] oh my god blessed be the name of the
[1:03:52] lord
[1:03:54] it feels good to be in church you seek
[1:03:57] come to church you're going to get here
[1:04:02] amen
[1:04:06] hebrew chapter 11 if you dare you can
[1:04:09] say amen
[1:04:11] verse eight few people still few people
[1:04:16] okay now we're fine by what
[1:04:20] by faith abraham remember abraham left
[1:04:23] the land of the caldins you remember
[1:04:26] by faith abraham when he was called
[1:04:29] to go out into a place which he should
[1:04:33] after received for an inheritance it was
[1:04:36] a future inheritance
[1:04:38] he obeyed obeyed and he went out
[1:04:42] not knowing where he went
[1:04:46] how can god tell you leave your family
[1:04:48] leave your country
[1:04:50] leave everything go you don't even know
[1:04:51] where you're going
[1:04:54] it takes revelation verse 9
[1:04:57] by faith his sojourn in a land
[1:05:01] of promise as in a strange
[1:05:04] country so when god told abraham live
[1:05:07] where you
[1:05:08] are go to where i'm going to show you
[1:05:11] the lord directed the foot of abraham to
[1:05:14] the promised land
[1:05:16] when abraham reached in the promised
[1:05:18] land
[1:05:19] everybody can even imagine that oh
[1:05:22] abraham can say well
[1:05:23] this is the place that god wants me to
[1:05:25] live so i can rest here
[1:05:27] but there was something in the life of
[1:05:30] abraham
[1:05:31] even though he reached the promised land
[1:05:34] abraham walk in that promised land
[1:05:37] as a stranger
[1:05:41] anybody clear as in a strange country
[1:05:46] dwelling in water tabernacle instead
[1:05:50] of abraham getting there and building a
[1:05:52] building of concrete
[1:05:54] abraham was acting like he have not
[1:05:57] reached the place yet
[1:06:00] or god told him to leave from egypt to
[1:06:03] canaan
[1:06:04] he get to canaan but abraham was living
[1:06:07] in canaan
[1:06:08] like he have not reached his objective
[1:06:11] yet
[1:06:12] are you following me he was in the world
[1:06:16] in egypt in egypt 100
[1:06:20] black dog 100 black dog
[1:06:24] you understand then he moved to the
[1:06:26] promised land
[1:06:28] when he reached the promised land 100
[1:06:32] on the inside white dog
[1:06:35] and the outside is still black dog
[1:06:38] that's why abraham was living like he
[1:06:41] was a stranger
[1:06:43] because there was another place that
[1:06:46] abraham need to get
[1:06:48] in that place it's a hundred percent
[1:06:51] white dog
[1:06:52] and a hundred percent white dog
[1:06:55] do you want me to repeat it again did i
[1:06:59] lose anybody
[1:07:01] okay praise the name of the lord let me
[1:07:03] say it
[1:07:04] somebody might be struggling i would add
[1:07:07] a man
[1:07:08] in a man can you see that okay
[1:07:11] when you are in egypt in the world you
[1:07:13] are sinner
[1:07:15] on the outside black dog on the inside
[1:07:19] black dog 100 when god
[1:07:22] called you out amen he's separating
[1:07:26] first the inner man
[1:07:29] are you there then he bring you to the
[1:07:31] promised land
[1:07:33] which is the message of the hour
[1:07:37] when you get into canaan in the promised
[1:07:40] land
[1:07:41] then the outside is still black dog
[1:07:45] but the inside is a white dog
[1:07:48] you still have to fight in the promised
[1:07:51] land
[1:07:52] that's why brother branham said the
[1:07:54] promised land is not the millennium
[1:07:57] because in the promised land the black
[1:07:59] dog is still
[1:08:00] dead which is a type of the baptism of
[1:08:04] the holy ghost
[1:08:05] but your body is still struggling that's
[1:08:09] why abraham was
[1:08:10] living as a stranger in other words
[1:08:13] even though abraham is confronted
[1:08:16] but he is careful about the land he's
[1:08:19] living around
[1:08:21] are you following me even though you are
[1:08:24] born again
[1:08:25] you must be careful about the kingdom of
[1:08:28] the world
[1:08:30] because there is another land that you
[1:08:32] must go
[1:08:33] but in thailand for you to go the black
[1:08:37] dog must be kicked out
[1:08:39] so when you enter into that land
[1:08:42] everything else will be white and white
[1:08:45] then you can get in the millennium then
[1:08:48] you can get in the new jerusalem
[1:08:51] everybody clear so far
[1:08:54] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:08:56] hallelujah
[1:08:58] he should not even have bothered me
[1:09:02] amen verse 9 by
[1:09:08] his surgeon in the land of water
[1:09:11] how can you live in a printer land or
[1:09:13] promise as a stranger
[1:09:15] you should be resting you should say oh
[1:09:17] this is my finality abraham understood
[1:09:21] that was not
[1:09:22] funnel that was just a process
[1:09:25] into finality where is the process
[1:09:28] as in a strange country dwelling in
[1:09:32] water
[1:09:32] tabernacle with isaac and jacob
[1:09:36] the hair with him of the same water
[1:09:39] so everybody that is connected to that
[1:09:42] promise
[1:09:43] whether it's jacob whether it's isaac
[1:09:47] they always live in the tent
[1:09:52] everybody that is joined into the
[1:09:55] baptism of the holy spirit
[1:09:57] because by one spirit we are all
[1:10:00] baptized into one body
[1:10:02] once you get in the promised land
[1:10:05] automatically the world becomes stranger
[1:10:09] to you
[1:10:13] everybody clear why was he
[1:10:17] dwelling like that abraham verse 10
[1:10:20] for he did what
[1:10:23] abraham why do you look for something
[1:10:26] else
[1:10:27] when god brought you in the promised
[1:10:29] land
[1:10:33] god said leave aye
[1:10:36] god to be abraham left
[1:10:39] a went to be god say i'm gonna give you
[1:10:42] b
[1:10:42] as your promised land what else do you
[1:10:44] look for
[1:10:48] you need a prophet you need a prophet
[1:10:53] at the opening of the seventh hill
[1:10:56] this bible become anew
[1:11:00] let's go verse 10 for he did what
[1:11:04] for what he was looking for a cd
[1:11:10] why do you look for another city abraham
[1:11:15] why there was a city here
[1:11:18] that was called jerusalem
[1:11:23] that existed already but when abraham
[1:11:27] got into this city
[1:11:29] he met the king of jerusalem
[1:11:32] who was melchizedek
[1:11:36] are you there when abraham talked to
[1:11:39] melchizedek
[1:11:40] they said mckinsey was the king of salem
[1:11:44] so melchizedek had the city
[1:11:48] but that city was not an earthly city
[1:11:54] because melchizedek was a theophany
[1:11:57] [Applause]
[1:12:01] are you there jerusalem existed already
[1:12:06] when mercy i came he was the king of
[1:12:08] what jerusalem
[1:12:10] so abraham probably thought oh so you're
[1:12:12] the king of that city
[1:12:13] mechizadek said no that is not my city
[1:12:17] then abraham begin to look for a water
[1:12:21] a city what kind of city
[1:12:25] hallelujah verse 10 for he look for what
[1:12:30] a city which has water
[1:12:38] who's what and what
[1:12:42] is what the new jerusalem jerusalem that
[1:12:46] was existing here
[1:12:48] was built by men
[1:12:51] but abraham was looking for a city
[1:12:55] that is not touched by men
[1:12:58] the making of the city and the entire
[1:13:01] building of that city is made by who
[1:13:10] in other words when abraham was here his
[1:13:13] eyes opened here are you following me
[1:13:18] once you are called from egypt
[1:13:21] it's gonna open the mystery of the
[1:13:24] promised land
[1:13:26] when you are in the promised land the
[1:13:29] holy ghost will open
[1:13:31] a mystery to a different direction
[1:13:38] the holy ghost will never make you feel
[1:13:41] like you homer he will always remind you
[1:13:46] that this world is not your home
[1:13:51] amen when trouble comes
[1:13:54] when politic disappointed you when your
[1:13:58] friend disappoints you when your family
[1:14:01] disappoints you
[1:14:02] when everybody disappoints you then the
[1:14:05] holy spirit says
[1:14:06] the reason why it happened because we
[1:14:09] are not
[1:14:09] there yet
[1:14:15] are you there a city
[1:14:18] which has foundation this is a message
[1:14:22] laying
[1:14:22] right here that is lingering because
[1:14:25] there is 12 foundation to that city
[1:14:27] it's in the book of revelation and they
[1:14:30] have the name of the apostle
[1:14:31] and the name of the patriarch which
[1:14:33] gives you the 24 elders
[1:14:36] it's laying right here
[1:14:39] hallelujah they've seen who's building
[1:14:43] and maker is who verse 11
[1:14:46] through faith also sarah
[1:14:49] herself received strength to conceive
[1:14:53] seed
[1:14:54] and was delivered of a child when she
[1:14:57] was past
[1:14:57] age because she did what
[1:15:00] she considered she judged him who
[1:15:04] who had the part the promise drop now to
[1:15:08] verse 13.
[1:15:10] hallelujah these all
[1:15:13] all these people died in water
[1:15:18] so some of them slept
[1:15:22] but in this age not everybody was
[1:15:25] sleeping
[1:15:31] some will not sleep at the
[1:15:36] trumpet of god the voice of direct angel
[1:15:40] some people will be alive that are not
[1:15:43] going to slip
[1:15:47] these all died in water
[1:15:51] where did they get that faithful
[1:15:57] anybody clear not having received the
[1:16:01] water
[1:16:02] the promises but having water
[1:16:07] vision they understood there is a city
[1:16:09] somewhere
[1:16:10] there is an objective we need to reach
[1:16:14] and where persuaded of them
[1:16:17] indeed what how did they impress it
[1:16:22] they were looking far off
[1:16:27] hallelujah indeed what
[1:16:30] and confess that they were water how can
[1:16:34] you be
[1:16:34] stranger in the promised land
[1:16:41] you see now there were stranger and what
[1:16:45] how can you be a temporary resident
[1:16:49] in your inheritance
[1:16:54] you see now and pilgrim on the water
[1:16:58] so they understood something else
[1:17:02] verse 14 for today
[1:17:05] there had such things which means
[1:17:08] the people that are having their mindset
[1:17:13] the people that have caught the vision
[1:17:17] the people that understood that we are
[1:17:21] not at the final point yet
[1:17:24] you understand when those
[1:17:27] that have such things declare
[1:17:31] plainly that they seek a weapon
[1:17:35] so by having the vision you are
[1:17:38] actually testifying to people that i am
[1:17:41] looking for my destination
[1:17:46] verse 15 and truly
[1:17:49] if there have been water of
[1:17:52] the country from where they were
[1:17:56] in other words when you leave egypt
[1:18:00] you follow me you must burn the bridge
[1:18:06] remember holy bar in our holla you
[1:18:09] understand
[1:18:11] so when they left egypt
[1:18:14] and they came in the promised land
[1:18:17] their mindset their
[1:18:20] thinking was constantly
[1:18:24] about this city
[1:18:29] do you follow me this city
[1:18:32] was calling for them
[1:18:36] are you there because in here
[1:18:39] they have mentions
[1:18:45] are you there they have physical mention
[1:18:50] and spiritual mention
[1:18:53] theophany and tiofani
[1:18:56] are calling
[1:19:01] are you following me are you following
[1:19:03] me and
[1:19:04] paul is saying that if their thought
[1:19:08] was about this this is why israel get in
[1:19:12] trouble
[1:19:14] when they move in the wilderness we
[1:19:16] remember the fishes we ate in egypt
[1:19:19] when they moved a little bit we remember
[1:19:21] the water in egypt
[1:19:23] so their mind was completely from the
[1:19:26] country
[1:19:27] where they came from let's go back
[1:19:32] and truly if they had been mindful
[1:19:36] of that country from where they came out
[1:19:39] right here if they were always thinking
[1:19:43] about it
[1:19:45] if you are always thinking about the
[1:19:48] world
[1:19:51] if you are always thinking about that
[1:19:54] church
[1:19:57] from where god pulled you out
[1:20:04] do you understand me do you understand
[1:20:07] me
[1:20:09] do you understand me that's why you
[1:20:12] must burn the bridges
[1:20:15] you must separate them
[1:20:19] if constantly you are still tempering
[1:20:23] with the dog church from where god
[1:20:27] pull you out
[1:20:32] okay i hope you are catching them
[1:20:39] and truly if they had been mindful
[1:20:43] of that country from where they came
[1:20:47] out it might be the world
[1:20:52] it might be denomination
[1:20:55] it might be a
[1:21:00] a message church
[1:21:03] inverted cameras
[1:21:07] are you there if they were mindful
[1:21:11] of that country from where they came out
[1:21:14] because every country have a spirit
[1:21:17] by principalities you remember
[1:21:21] they might have water had the
[1:21:24] opportunity to do water
[1:21:27] so when you are constantly thinking
[1:21:30] about where you came out
[1:21:33] actually you are listening to the black
[1:21:36] dog
[1:21:37] pulling you back again while god is
[1:21:40] moving forward
[1:21:43] somebody is pulling you back
[1:21:46] there is a city calling you backward
[1:21:50] and there is also a new jerusalem
[1:21:53] calling you forward
[1:21:59] galatians 4 verse 26
[1:22:02] but jerusalem which is what
[1:22:10] not this jerusalem but the one where
[1:22:13] melchizedek is the king so there was
[1:22:17] enough free jerusalem and uh
[1:22:21] anybody clear that jerusalem
[1:22:24] which is above his water that's why you
[1:22:27] have
[1:22:27] freedom by the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:22:31] it cuts you completely loose
[1:22:34] come on which is the word
[1:22:38] so that seed is your mother
[1:22:44] a city is a woman
[1:22:47] a city is a church ephesus is a woman in
[1:22:51] church
[1:22:52] come let me show you the bride the city
[1:22:56] when you look at that bride it was a
[1:22:57] city
[1:22:58] but that seed is your mother it is
[1:23:01] giving birth
[1:23:02] so when you get birth here
[1:23:07] born again here something happened
[1:23:10] in that city
[1:23:14] go in the church ages of sardis
[1:23:19] go read the name put on the book of life
[1:23:23] you're gonna see that there is a record
[1:23:25] in psalm 89
[1:23:26] if i'm not mistaken where they are
[1:23:28] taking record of those that are born
[1:23:31] in zion god's church your message
[1:23:36] but jerusalem which is above his word
[1:23:40] which is the mother of water the mother
[1:23:44] of azor so when you are
[1:23:45] born from here into jerusalem
[1:23:49] you are born by your mother jerusalem
[1:23:51] birthed you
[1:23:52] by the baptism of the holy spirit and
[1:23:55] then that jerusalem
[1:23:57] is not represented here
[1:24:00] it is a heavenly jerusalem not this
[1:24:03] earthly
[1:24:04] so that city is pulling is calling you
[1:24:07] back
[1:24:08] because that's where you belong and one
[1:24:11] of this day there will be a city coming
[1:24:13] down
[1:24:14] from heaven to sit then you're gonna
[1:24:16] find your
[1:24:17] house there you're gonna find your
[1:24:20] address
[1:24:21] your house furnish and everything that's
[1:24:24] where you're gonna live for eternity
[1:24:26] let's pray heavenly father
[1:24:30] lord we thank you again father for your
[1:24:32] grace
[1:24:33] for your love for your mercy and also
[1:24:36] for your deliverance

[1:24:45] hand
[1:24:46] father may you take all the glory may
[1:24:48] the devil be completely sealed out
[1:24:51] may only the holy spirit and the angel
[1:24:54] of the lord be sealed in
[1:24:56] father may you give revelation to your
[1:24:58] children
[1:24:59] those that are present here and those
[1:25:01] that are streaming lord
[1:25:03] father may you break every spirit of
[1:25:05] rebellion
[1:25:06] every spirit of resentment every spirit
[1:25:09] of unbelief
[1:25:11] all kind of spirit that's going to block
[1:25:13] the word lord for being effective
[1:25:15] into the life of your children lord we
[1:25:18] embrace it and commit everything unto
[1:25:20] the hand
[1:25:20] in the name of jesus christ amen
[1:25:24] god bless you we are on port 24 we're
[1:25:27] gonna find out
[1:25:28] about the team later on
[1:25:32] in the message who do you say this is
[1:25:36] okay brother brother say
[1:25:39] here is a woman standing here i am a
[1:25:42] young man
[1:25:44] waiting to get married she meet my
[1:25:47] specifications
[1:25:48] in every way she is a lovely christian
[1:25:52] she looks like one she looks like one
[1:25:58] she looks like one she dresses
[1:26:02] like one
[1:26:05] brother not only the look of the face
[1:26:09] she must look like a christian she must
[1:26:13] dress like a christian and she must act
[1:26:16] like water
[1:26:17] like a christian because you must
[1:26:19] abstain from
[1:26:20] all appearance of what evil
[1:26:24] she lives like one i shall admit
[1:26:29] she'd make me a good wife
[1:26:32] but she's not mine
[1:26:36] until i take her for mine
[1:26:39] so you can't claim her to be your wife
[1:26:42] until you get married to her
[1:26:44] then you can call her this is my wife
[1:26:47] and then she can call you
[1:26:48] this is my husband brother branham say
[1:26:52] that is the way the message is
[1:26:59] are you there you can say
[1:27:02] the message is beautiful
[1:27:06] you can say the message is good
[1:27:09] you can say the message makes sense
[1:27:12] you can say that you like the message
[1:27:15] until you get in union with the message
[1:27:19] the message is not yours yet
[1:27:25] that is the way with the they made the
[1:27:28] way
[1:27:29] the message is you can do it
[1:27:33] you can sympathize with it and say
[1:27:36] it's right but you got to
[1:27:40] take it yourself to become water
[1:27:45] part of it then you
[1:27:48] and the message become water so what we
[1:27:51] are preaching here
[1:27:54] that is coming from the bible and that
[1:27:57] is coming from the
[1:27:59] message of the hour it will not help you
[1:28:02] if you don't take it
[1:28:09] when then you and the message become one
[1:28:14] when you and the message become one what
[1:28:16] happened
[1:28:18] then the anointing is with you
[1:28:23] do you follow me as it is with the water
[1:28:28] in other words when they are preaching
[1:28:31] the word
[1:28:32] and you are receiving that word
[1:28:35] the anointing that comes with that word
[1:28:38] will also come on you
[1:28:40] and make you become what that word has
[1:28:44] been preaching
[1:28:46] are you there because the spoken word
[1:28:49] is the original water and every seed
[1:28:53] must reproduce
[1:28:54] according to its own so for you to
[1:28:58] become the message
[1:28:59] you must receive the message then the
[1:29:03] spirit of the message
[1:29:04] will come and help you be the message
[1:29:09] you become what you eat
[1:29:13] ever clear if you open your mouth to
[1:29:16] swallow it
[1:29:19] let's go to ezekiel 23 when we were
[1:29:23] last week amen
[1:29:28] hang tight and you're going to get it
[1:29:34] i wish those that are missing will come
[1:29:38] and get this because it's going to avoid
[1:29:40] them a lot of headache
[1:29:42] in the future especially those that are
[1:29:45] not married
[1:29:50] ezekiel 23
[1:29:53] are you there when we went to ezekiel 23
[1:29:58] we already talked about a hola we went
[1:30:00] to a holy bar
[1:30:02] and from a holy bar we dropped down to
[1:30:04] verse 36
[1:30:06] let's go to verse 40. to save time
[1:30:09] because you already know the other one
[1:30:12] verse 40.
[1:30:13] and furthermore
[1:30:17] remember holla and a holy bar left egypt
[1:30:22] and they went to the promised land but
[1:30:24] they never forgot about egypt
[1:30:28] are you there then when the thinking of
[1:30:32] egypt was constantly in their mind
[1:30:36] the devil gave them another substitution
[1:30:40] for egypt which was the assyrian
[1:30:43] that was close neighbor and the assyrian
[1:30:47] took them
[1:30:48] and pulled them back again to where they
[1:30:50] came from
[1:30:51] starting at zero verse 40.
[1:30:54] and furthermore after they got polluted
[1:30:58] and everything
[1:31:01] and furthermore that you have sent for
[1:31:04] men
[1:31:06] to come from far these men that are
[1:31:08] coming from far
[1:31:10] are the sabbaths i can give you a
[1:31:12] scripture you need it you see me after
[1:31:14] church
[1:31:15] there is a scripture where the bible say
[1:31:17] the serbians are the people that live
[1:31:19] far off
[1:31:20] so she called for sabbats because
[1:31:23] her mind she had the egyptian in mind
[1:31:27] and the bible says that the egyptian was
[1:31:30] man
[1:31:30] of great flesh
[1:31:33] here in other words the anatomy the
[1:31:36] morphology of the egyptian
[1:31:38] were more prone to sexuality
[1:31:42] so she must match somebody she must find
[1:31:45] somebody else even though egypt is a
[1:31:48] little bit far off
[1:31:49] she's going to find somebody else that's
[1:31:51] going to replace
[1:31:52] what she had in the past
[1:31:56] and if you study the scripture you will
[1:31:58] see that the savage were
[1:31:59] men of great stature they were giant
[1:32:04] i have the scripture if you want me to
[1:32:07] to whom she sent
[1:32:08] a message a messenger was sent and lord
[1:32:11] they came
[1:32:12] for whom you did wash yourself
[1:32:16] everybody come on
[1:32:19] painted your eyes and deck yourself with
[1:32:23] what
[1:32:24] ornament so right here we can see that
[1:32:27] the purpose of this birth taking
[1:32:31] the purpose of painting her eyes
[1:32:34] and the purpose of decking herself with
[1:32:38] all kind of
[1:32:39] was because she wanna meet a lover
[1:32:45] anybody clear the purpose
[1:32:48] of her other appearance
[1:32:53] their purpose they aim their vision
[1:32:57] is to please man
[1:33:02] everybody clear you follow me so
[1:33:05] sometimes you might be
[1:33:06] putting something on you innocently
[1:33:10] but that those things are made
[1:33:13] by the devil to attract men
[1:33:22] lord help me and take yourself with
[1:33:26] ornament
[1:33:27] and sat upon a stately bed very luxury
[1:33:31] and a terrible prepared before me where
[1:33:34] upon you
[1:33:35] whereupon you have set my incense and my
[1:33:38] old
[1:33:39] and a voice of multitude being at ease a
[1:33:42] party going on
[1:33:42] was with her and with men of common
[1:33:45] sword
[1:33:48] a well-brought serbians if you look at
[1:33:51] the word serbians they are drunkers
[1:33:54] so she brought drunkers everybody clear
[1:33:58] from the wilderness which put bracelet
[1:34:01] upon their hand we already told you
[1:34:03] young people
[1:34:04] men don't put bracelet and beautiful
[1:34:07] crown
[1:34:08] upon their heads right here we can see
[1:34:12] that there is a door
[1:34:14] that has been opened to worldliness
[1:34:16] ahola and a holly bar
[1:34:19] were pulled out of the world now they
[1:34:22] are back into the world
[1:34:24] the daughter of zion were already living
[1:34:27] in israel
[1:34:28] but the prophecy of isaiah 3 is saying
[1:34:31] that those daughters
[1:34:33] will begin to behave like sodom
[1:34:37] brother branham said we read this last
[1:34:39] week
[1:34:40] this is the major sin of our days
[1:34:43] it's the major sin among our people
[1:34:46] which is what
[1:34:47] wilderness as the bible says laodicea
[1:34:51] said she is welcome
[1:34:53] so we are dealing with an age of
[1:34:55] worldliness
[1:34:57] now let's go to proverbs chapter 6 this
[1:34:59] is where we stopped last week
[1:35:02] if you dare you can say amen proverb
[1:35:05] chapter 6
[1:35:06] then we're going to take off if you can
[1:35:10] allow me tom

[1:35:14] you there verse 24 if you dare you can
[1:35:17] say amen
[1:35:18] to keep you from the water
[1:35:23] so in proverbs chapter 6 there is a
[1:35:26] woman
[1:35:28] and that woman is what she's evil
[1:35:33] she's not a good woman she doesn't act
[1:35:35] like a christian
[1:35:37] she doesn't live like a christian she
[1:35:39] doesn't even look like one
[1:35:43] am i clear because the bible calls her
[1:35:45] evil
[1:35:47] all right to keep you from the evil
[1:35:50] woman
[1:35:51] from the flattery of her tongue of the
[1:35:55] tongue of a strange water
[1:35:57] so not only is she evil but she
[1:36:00] covered this evil
[1:36:05] with
[1:36:09] everybody flattery she's so sweet
[1:36:14] but she's not really sweet she's
[1:36:17] bad she's gonna be bad when she is in
[1:36:21] your home
[1:36:24] then you're gonna see her colors she's
[1:36:27] gonna be bad when you leave your parents
[1:36:30] house
[1:36:31] and you begin to live on your own
[1:36:33] apartment
[1:36:34] and you begin to live with her as a
[1:36:36] boyfriend and girlfriend
[1:36:38] then you're gonna see her color but when
[1:36:41] she's looking for you
[1:36:43] she's covering herself that bad
[1:36:46] character
[1:36:47] with flattery everybody clear
[1:36:51] mama is straight she's sweeter than mama
[1:36:56] anybody clear verse 25
[1:36:59] what is that word lust
[1:37:03] we have read a lot of time where the
[1:37:06] bible say
[1:37:06] lust and daughter lust and daughter it's
[1:37:09] the same word
[1:37:11] lust is not to appreciate
[1:37:20] are you there there is a difference
[1:37:23] between
[1:37:24] lust and appreciation
[1:37:28] are you there you can look at the flower
[1:37:31] and you say that's a beautiful flower
[1:37:35] you can look at a sister and you've
[1:37:38] never seen her
[1:37:39] and you seen her the first time you say
[1:37:41] wow that sister is beautiful
[1:37:43] you are not lasting anybody
[1:37:47] many times women sisters will see
[1:37:50] a younger sister coming from another
[1:37:52] church they can look at her and they say
[1:37:55] wow she's beautiful you're gonna hear
[1:37:57] she's gorgeous
[1:37:58] look at her she's pretty that is not
[1:38:01] lasting
[1:38:03] everybody lasting is usually connected
[1:38:08] with a sexual desire
[1:38:12] are you are you following me what
[1:38:15] can a woman wear
[1:38:18] [Music]
[1:38:20] instead of you appreciating her
[1:38:26] what she put on turn you on
[1:38:34] if you don't understand this you won't
[1:38:36] understand what the scripture is saying
[1:38:39] if a sister is beautiful
[1:38:42] she wear a beautiful dress and she goes
[1:38:46] back and forth you can put her in front
[1:38:49] of a
[1:38:49] nightclub you can put her everywhere you
[1:38:52] want to
[1:38:54] if a man look at that woman they will
[1:38:56] tell you why
[1:38:57] she's praying and that's it
[1:39:01] amen when man appreciate
[1:39:04] that they have no desire
[1:39:08] to have sex with her everybody
[1:39:12] there is something a woman must
[1:39:15] do to turn
[1:39:19] men from appreciation to lust
[1:39:23] are you following me because there are
[1:39:26] four types of love
[1:39:29] we have a gap in love remember that
[1:39:33] we have failure love we have
[1:39:36] lust full of and we have what
[1:39:40] filthy love young sister when you want
[1:39:44] to get
[1:39:44] married are you there
[1:39:47] don't attract your husband through this
[1:39:52] door you following me
[1:39:55] make sure what attract men towards you
[1:39:59] is not the lustful love
[1:40:03] are you there man must attract you
[1:40:06] by failure do you follow me
[1:40:10] when somebody look at you she's a
[1:40:13] beautiful woman
[1:40:15] then the thoughts come
[1:40:18] she can i can get married to her the man
[1:40:21] is right here
[1:40:23] everybody follow me then he goes to a
[1:40:26] girl payloaf
[1:40:27] you follow me and he's going to ask
[1:40:30] agape love
[1:40:32] agape love is this the right woman for
[1:40:36] my life
[1:40:37] you follow me you follow me then agape
[1:40:42] will give you his family whether that is
[1:40:46] the myth of your life or not
[1:40:49] if agape say no you still love her
[1:40:54] but not to be your wife
[1:40:58] are you following me you're not going to
[1:41:00] hate her
[1:41:02] every time you see her you say man that
[1:41:04] woman is beautiful
[1:41:05] you are not even ashamed to tell your
[1:41:09] wife
[1:41:10] that that woman is beautiful
[1:41:14] are you following me when our gap say
[1:41:17] yes this is your wife then you go back
[1:41:21] and you talk to her are you there
[1:41:24] but an immoral woman
[1:41:28] an evil woman is
[1:41:31] on this category here everybody clear
[1:41:35] so the door she open is not
[1:41:38] a door to a gap in love that's why
[1:41:42] your boyfriend and girlfriend
[1:41:45] relationship
[1:41:46] fell are you there
[1:41:50] because they were based on to last for
[1:41:52] love
[1:41:54] are you there let's go back to the
[1:41:57] scripture
[1:41:59] last not after her what
[1:42:02] can you see a natural woman beautiful
[1:42:05] and when you see her you begin to laugh
[1:42:07] stuff for her
[1:42:09] go even call a drunker and tell him to
[1:42:11] look at the sister
[1:42:13] which is well dr well dressed and
[1:42:14] everything
[1:42:16] it doesn't click in their mind to last
[1:42:19] after a woman like that
[1:42:21] are you there last not after her beauty
[1:42:25] in your heart why in your heart
[1:42:28] remember matthew 5 28
[1:42:31] who so looked upon a what a woman and
[1:42:35] lasted after her in a water
[1:42:38] how can you look at a woman and lasted
[1:42:41] after her
[1:42:42] brother branham said the reason why it
[1:42:45] happened
[1:42:46] is because that woman presents herself
[1:42:49] a certain way to cause men
[1:42:53] not to appreciate her but to laugh stuff
[1:42:57] to her
[1:42:59] one day brother brandon asked me that me
[1:43:02] to ask brother branham
[1:43:04] she said brother branham you were
[1:43:06] married before
[1:43:08] with hope hope died and you got married
[1:43:11] to me
[1:43:12] when we go to heaven are you there
[1:43:15] between me and hope who is gonna be your
[1:43:19] wife
[1:43:20] sister mida was thinking about filio
[1:43:24] because here there is jealousy
[1:43:28] everybody clear she want to hold brother
[1:43:30] branham to herself
[1:43:32] she said now when we go to heaven we're
[1:43:34] going to be two people
[1:43:36] with you so who is going to be us
[1:43:40] brother branham say let me give you an
[1:43:42] example
[1:43:43] brother obama said if you see a woman
[1:43:46] coming and hugging me a sinner what are
[1:43:50] you gonna do
[1:43:50] she said i won't like it feel it
[1:43:54] filio are you there brother branham said
[1:43:57] take me out of the picture
[1:44:00] and put jesus christ if mary magdalene
[1:44:04] comes and fell in the feet of jesus
[1:44:08] and begin to hug and kiss jesus would
[1:44:11] you like it or not
[1:44:14] yes you're gonna like it he said now you
[1:44:16] are no more in philly
[1:44:18] you are now in agape because in agape
[1:44:21] you don't think again the same way are
[1:44:24] you there
[1:44:25] you don't you will be even appreciated
[1:44:27] like okay she came to her maker
[1:44:29] are you following me now what is going
[1:44:32] to make a man
[1:44:33] look at a woman and last brother branham
[1:44:35] say it is because of
[1:44:37] the way the woman present herself
[1:44:43] there are almost four to five things
[1:44:46] that a woman can do to cause a man
[1:44:50] to last after her you ready
[1:44:54] number one she must expose
[1:44:58] part of her flesh
[1:45:02] everybody following me anybody following
[1:45:05] me
[1:45:06] number two a woman
[1:45:09] have to wear something that is tight
[1:45:16] her shape
[1:45:19] or her form are you following me
[1:45:24] number three she can wear something that
[1:45:27] cover
[1:45:28] her body but you can see through
[1:45:32] that that is what you have like
[1:45:35] laces sister
[1:45:39] you see a sister in a message wearing a
[1:45:42] long lessons here
[1:45:43] but you can see through the lessons all
[1:45:46] the way here
[1:45:48] when the garment you are wearing
[1:45:52] is like a veil somebody can see through
[1:45:55] you must put something
[1:45:56] under it do you follow me
[1:46:00] it is not a matter of being long
[1:46:03] but your body must be protected
[1:46:08] everybody following me the fourth thing
[1:46:12] is to wear high heel
[1:46:16] just relax high heel
[1:46:20] will give a woman a temporary shape
[1:46:29] that is not the shape she was born with
[1:46:32] i'm gonna prove to you just relax with
[1:46:35] me
[1:46:35] everybody clear and number five
[1:46:39] is when a woman wear a garment
[1:46:42] that pretend to men
[1:46:47] you want me repeat it again when a woman
[1:46:51] does these kind of things she is
[1:46:54] automatically dropping under
[1:46:57] restful love you follow me
[1:47:01] when men look at you because
[1:47:04] you expose your breasts because
[1:47:08] you expose your time automatically
[1:47:12] it is no longer an appreciation
[1:47:15] it turned into a lust because what you
[1:47:19] did
[1:47:20] is creating a sexual appetite
[1:47:23] to the man the man begin to long to have
[1:47:27] sex with you
[1:47:28] not longing to have you as a wife
[1:47:32] it's just that the traveler came
[1:47:35] straight on
[1:47:37] and he's trying to appease the travelers
[1:47:40] but he doesn't want anything to do with
[1:47:42] you that's why you see people
[1:47:45] changing women one after the other today
[1:47:48] he's here
[1:47:48] he broke a relationship he changed broke
[1:47:51] a relationship he changed
[1:47:52] broke a relationship insurance because
[1:47:54] he has been provoked
[1:47:56] by women anybody understanding me
[1:48:00] let's go to verse 25 last not after her
[1:48:03] beauty
[1:48:04] in your heart neither let you let her
[1:48:07] take you with her water how can a
[1:48:10] normal woman i lead take you
[1:48:14] that's why a holla and a holly bar
[1:48:17] when men are coming to them they have to
[1:48:20] paint their eyes
[1:48:22] to cause men to last after them because
[1:48:25] they already lasted
[1:48:27] after the men so they wanted
[1:48:30] those men to be turned on as soon as
[1:48:33] they get on
[1:48:34] because they are already burning
[1:48:38] and they want to satisfy their burning
[1:48:41] so they must wear something that can
[1:48:44] cause a man to drop
[1:48:46] in their category do you follow me
[1:48:50] hallelujah jeremiah

[1:51:32] god

[1:54:39] never missed because
[1:54:42] it's a gift of infallibility
[1:54:46] because brother branham was entering
[1:54:49] into the database of god
[1:54:56] brother prophet has access to the mind
[1:55:00] of god
[1:55:01] that's why brother branham can enter and
[1:55:04] see you
[1:55:05] and come back and call your name even
[1:55:07] though he never met you
[1:55:10] are you following me
[1:55:13] my god job
[1:55:16] chapter 10 verse 8 and 9.
[1:55:20] that hand which hang on
[1:55:24] the hands of god that hand
[1:55:27] has done what and do what
[1:55:32] fashion me together round about
[1:55:37] job is saying that what i am today
[1:55:42] i am not a product of my father
[1:55:47] i am not a product of my mother
[1:55:51] because maybe your father wants you to
[1:55:53] look like him
[1:55:54] but god said you're going to look like
[1:55:56] your mother
[1:55:58] maybe your father wants you to look like
[1:56:00] him
[1:56:01] and god said you're gonna look like your
[1:56:04] uncle on your mother's side
[1:56:06] and when mama look he said this is like
[1:56:08] my brother
[1:56:09] it is not mommy or daddy it is god that
[1:56:14] fashioned you like that
[1:56:17] are you there there knows that you have
[1:56:24] michael jackson
[1:56:31] are we okay i'm laying a foundation for
[1:56:34] you
[1:56:35] forever forever my brother forever
[1:56:39] i wish all the young people were here
[1:56:41] today
[1:56:42] the nose that you have
[1:56:45] the way your nose looked like
[1:56:49] mama did not do it
[1:56:51] [Music]
[1:56:53] maggie jackson it is not mama
[1:56:56] god made your nose like that
[1:57:07] are you following me
[1:57:10] michael jackson when you change
[1:57:14] their mouth you are actually
[1:57:18] telling god that the blueprint
[1:57:22] he made is wrong
[1:57:26] you are actually insulting god
[1:57:33] you are telling god you made a mistake
[1:57:39] the human category you are under
[1:57:44] whether you are a black man
[1:57:49] i told you some of you will control will
[1:57:52] will catch the message whether you are
[1:57:54] white men
[1:57:57] whether you are an indian whether you
[1:58:00] are chinese
[1:58:02] whether you are mexican whether
[1:58:06] you are in panic it is god
[1:58:09] that shows that color
[1:58:19] you must be proud of your color
[1:58:26] you must appreciate your color
[1:58:30] you must appreciate your tone
[1:58:34] you must be proud to be a white man
[1:58:37] you must be proud to be a black man
[1:58:41] you must be proud to be a hispanic
[1:58:44] you must be proud to be an agent because
[1:58:47] it's not
[1:58:48] you that chose it it is god
[1:58:51] that chose you to be that way
[1:58:53] [Music]
[1:59:01] i told you i can preach a message if i
[1:59:03] preach it it will go all around
[1:59:06] but it's for this church by young people
[1:59:08] you understand what i'm saying
[1:59:10] don't change your tone
[1:59:17] because the picture god have for you
[1:59:20] is maybe a lighter complexion
[1:59:23] or a dark compression all you need to do
[1:59:27] is maintain it keep
[1:59:30] it clean keep it acceptable
[1:59:34] but don't change anything
[1:59:38] because you are going against what the
[1:59:41] creator said
[1:59:46] young people go back to this and go
[1:59:49] listen to it
[1:59:51] and some of your marriage problem will
[1:59:53] be answered

[2:01:04] if you put double screen they don't see
[2:01:06] it okay
[2:01:08] their hands have made me and did what
[2:01:12] fashioned me now you understand what it
[2:01:14] means

[2:11:36] water
[2:11:37] that we should do what who was he

[2:11:56] he is the fairest of what
[2:11:59] to what

[2:59:11] and no doubt there were maybe material
[2:59:15] or faces going all around the floor of

[2:59:29] planted some rope your prophet told us

[2:59:35] them
[2:59:36] to tell them that this is the house of
[2:59:38] prayer
[2:59:39] and the temple of the lord should not be
[2:59:41] tempering that way

[2:59:45] temple made by men's
[2:59:47] father you are living in the body temple
[2:59:49] that you make

[2:59:56] we take care
[2:59:57] of our home how should we take care of
