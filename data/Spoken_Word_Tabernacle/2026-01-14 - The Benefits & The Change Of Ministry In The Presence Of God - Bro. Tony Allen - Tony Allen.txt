TRANSCRIPT
========================================
enemy of fire. They found out when they went right down to the end staying on God's word, they possessed the gate. &gt;&gt; That's right. After Daniel, there had been a proclamation went forth and signed by the needs of Persians that could not be changed that if anybody prayed to any other god, let him be thrown into the lion's den. And Daniel knew that God's word was to pray to him on me. So he just opened up the windows and prayed anyhow. Now he never got back in a corner. He opened up the windows towards the temple. He wasn't ashamed of it. And we don't want to practice our religion on Sunday and Monday do something else or believe in our heart one thing, come before somebody else and say, "Well, I don't know. I Yeah, I think YOU'RE RIGHT." BE WHAT YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; You're not. Get out of the pull pit. Get out of the church. That's right. Because you're INDEBTED TO BOTH. SAY WHAT YOU ARE. SAY WHAT YOU BELIEVE. THEN YOU HAVE NOTHING to back up from. You're standing just exactly what's true. Everybody knows your colors. &gt;&gt; MAN WILL APPRECIATE YOU. ANY MAN, A WOMAN MIGHT BE AS UGLY AS ALL get out. She might be big, fat, little, skinny, blackheaded, browneyed, blue-eyed, grayeyed one one way and one THE OTHER. BUT IF THAT WOMAN IS clean lady in a man or country to take off his hat and he's got an ounce of man, &gt;&gt; right? Because she's SHE PRODUCES WHAT SHE is &gt;&gt; and man appreciate it. &gt;&gt; SO GOD APPRECIATE A MAN THAT'LL BE WHAT HE IS. OR MAN THAT PROFESSES CHRISTIANITY, LET'S BE A CHRISTIAN FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST, WITH THE WORD of God or forget about it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? Cuz otherwise you become hypocrisy and living a different life and people seem to run out there to dances and smoking and things like that and claiming to be a Christian and see you put a stumbling block in the other's way. See you women sometimes how they cut their hair and dressing act in these little dresses don't look like a skinned down weenie or something going out there on the street walking around a heels about that high mincing down the street. Is that Pentecostal? And the the other churches say they claim they've got something that they haven't. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE SEALED AND MARKED BY THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; You're not a dance hall tonight and hugged up in some man's arms that's not your husband the next night and come back to church and dance all over the place. That's not Pentecostal. That's hypocrisy. Phil, &gt;&gt; I'm not so much saying it to you, but you realize these tapes has made here goes over the world. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; So, I just preached like this to the whole world. &gt;&gt; When I feel God saying, "Say something." He just say it because I don't know where it's going to. That's up to him to take care of that. Just stay with the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. All right. No, Daniel would not bow down to their proclamation. Whether you stood out of the organization or not, &gt;&gt; he stayed RIGHT AT THE WINDOW AND STAYED WITH THE WORD OF GOD. HE WASN'T ASHAMED of it. What happened? They throw him into a lion's den, but he possessed the gates of the lion. &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. &gt;&gt; WHY? &gt;&gt; GLORY. GLORY TO GOD. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD SAID HIS seed shall possess the gate of the enemy. &gt;&gt; For what the enemy is, you got the gate. Oh, how many times can we look at Moses following in the line of God's commandments, went out into Egypt, LOOKED LIKE EVERYTHING WAS CONTRARY. He had some impersonators that went with him. He went out with a couple of signs to show that he was sent. Throw down a serpent and so forth like that. And here come the impersonators along, sold theirs down. WHAT COULD HE DO? NOTHING. GOD never told him to go to do that. He wanted to test Moses. He was the one who permitted Jambish and Jamus to throw down their serpents or their robbed. So there Hallelujah. Hey baby. Amen. Can be upstanding tonight. Amen. We just want to bless the name of the living God. Amen. But before then we just want to commit the service into the hands of the Lord and asking that he take preeminence tonight. We commit ourselves into his hands that he prepare our hearts even as he about using his vessel to speak onto us and also commit those on their way coming that the Lord will lead them safely into our midst. Let us pray. Father in the name of Jesus, we just want to bless you. We just want to give you all the glory. We just want to give you all the honor, the praise you deserve, Lord. Father, we thank you for our lives. We thank you for everything you've been doing, Lord. We lift your name on high tonight, Lord Jesus. Oh God, and we want to bless you, Lord.

There is a house that is gathered here, Father, that you have provided for yourself in this age, oh God. Lord, we thank you for this group of people that love you. That no matter what the weather is, oh Lord, they will come to meet with us. Oh God, Lord, we want to glorify your name. We want to bless you, oh God, for your grace, for your mercies.

Oh God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we want to thank you also for the preachers that you have raised to stand behind this word. Oh God, and support the message that was given by our prophet. Oh father. I remember when the prophet said, "Young people will raise up, oh God, and take this message forward. We believe you have blessed us with one in this church. And Lord, this may the glory and honor return back to you. I remember the mother and the baby. Father, &gt;&gt; Father, you can stop the bleeding. &gt;&gt; You can heal them all.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. &gt;&gt; So, we got a special from Sister Yubed and Sister Lily. through the fire. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you saints. Amen. So many times I've questioned certain circumstances or things I could not understand. Many times in trials, weakness blurs my vision and my frustration get so out of hand. Oh, it's then I am reminded I've never been forsaken. I've never had to stand one test alone. And as I look at all the victories, the spirit rises up in me. It's through the fire my weaknesses made strong. And oh, he never promised that the cross would not get heavy and the hill would not be hard to climb. No, he never offered our victories without fighting. But he said help would always come in time. Oh, just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary said give in just our God will show up. Oh, and he will take you through the fire again. Oh, I know within myself that I will surely perish. Oh, but if I trust the hand of God, he'll shield the flames again. Again. He never promised that the cross will not get heavy and the hill will not be hard to he never offer. Our victories will come fighting but he said help would always come.

Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord, let's come to you. &gt;&gt; Today is really my anniversary.

Let's go again. &gt;&gt; I will &gt;&gt; I will annex that testimony and say I came to church with no special. Brother Seth asked in the back. He was like, "Does anybody have a special?" And my mouth just opened and say, "Sister Lily and I will sing a song." What song? No idea. Through the fire. &gt;&gt; That was God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Lord, I come to you.

When you see the goodness of God and what he's doing in the life of his children, every single day in this church, testimonies, little little even in the little tiny detail things on our life, God is showing up. A very insignificant thing that we don't even think God is there. And here we go. He always showed up on time. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, we appreciate what the Lord is doing. Amen. Stay encouraged church. He disclosed to us faith in the way that even myself who was preaching never seen it. Amen. &gt;&gt; I I don't understand how a small scripture like that can hold so much things in it that you keep pulling, you keep pulling, you keep pulling, you keep pulling. God gave us the most essential the main thing and left faith in our hand because with faith we can create we can draw we can even buy purchase the Holy Spirit with faith. Amen. Amen. With faith you can even pull the Holy Spirit toward you. All it takes is faith. Faith for everything. And faith is our victory. The victory that overcometh the world is in faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; The world was created by faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you go to the stature of a perfect man, you look at the beginning, you see right there, faith. And once faith is there, everything is p is built on faith by revelation to revelation. There is not even anything you need to add. &gt;&gt; You don't have to add longsuffering. You just have faith for longsuffering. And after a while, you will see longsuffering happening in your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. We greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. both visible and invisible audience. Amen. Any family member here, God richly bless you. New subscriber online, God bless you and welcome to Spoken Word Tabernacle in our convention on a Wednesday. Amen. &gt;&gt; Keep praying this prayer is doing great things. &gt;&gt; Amen. Refreshing our soul, changing our life and the Holy Spirit is moving in a supernatural way. Amen. So keep praying. Everything is well. God is giving my wife a special strength. I know it's not easy in the body, but uh God knows and God knew that exactly she can take it at this time. Amen. Because if she would have take it last year, it could have been uh a different story and God hide everything since last year. They just come to find out this year something that already happened last year because he was in the war zone. Amen. So just continue to hold the family. She's here tonight very strong. We love you. The church support you. Stay strong. All is well and all it takes is a little bit of time and we will meet on the other side. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say there will be more surprises. There will be surprises over there. &gt;&gt; So it doesn't matter how or where people were just leave it alone in the hand of God. &gt;&gt; Sometime we act like we don't believe our own prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. We pray God to save our family member &gt;&gt; and then when the Lord take them out because of our way our conception of the way they're supposed to be saved. &gt;&gt; You want them to come to the altar to be baptized and to do this to do this. That's the way we want them to be saved. &gt;&gt; But nobody knew the thief of the cross have to go a certain way. &gt;&gt; So you think they're going to go in the Broadway. But if if it was not written about the thief of the cross, nobody would have known. We would have seen two criminals going to hell. Didn't know that that one never was baptized. Brother Brandham say that he was there now and he dropped from there and went where Abraham was. &gt;&gt; And where you didn't get me where &gt;&gt; he didn't go where the at the criminal where no he went where Abraham was without water baptism without being preached the gospel. And brother Brandham say himself he was a preacher. &gt;&gt; I gave you I have five quote. Brother Brandham say he himself was a preacher. So the only opportunity he have to preach he was preaching now as a criminal. &gt;&gt; And that's his sermon right there. &gt;&gt; If it's me and you, we would have think he need to step on the pulpit to preach. Church, our mind are so narrow. &gt;&gt; Amen. God has many ways. All you have to do claim your family. whether they are in church or outside the church. Claim your family. Believe your family. And then at the end of the day, guess what? If you believe, faith will put them there. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; I have a pro I have a question for you. Did Moses get into the promised land? &gt;&gt; According to the Old Testament, &gt;&gt; Moses died outside the promised land. And the Bible says that the angel buried him. But in the New Testament &gt;&gt; on more transfiguration, Moses entered the promised land and was sitting right there in Israel. To you, he was lost. &gt;&gt; But the true reality, he entered the promised land through the blood of Calvary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The children of Arty Wright were making fun of brother Brana. Yes, sir. And the Holy Ghost didn't wait for them to repent. &gt;&gt; You didn't get, maybe you don't get me. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost didn't wait for those children to repent first &gt;&gt; and to be baptized to get there. The Holy Ghost in them, whatever they were doing, the Holy Ghost bypass everything &gt;&gt; and burn everything that was bad and got in their soul and sealed them without a repentance. Brother Brham didn't say they those children stop and they begin to repent and the Holy Ghost came. Uh-uh. The Holy Ghost bypass repentance. &gt;&gt; Go read the message yourself. &gt;&gt; This message is powerful. &gt;&gt; And this message got benefit. &gt;&gt; There is a benefit to follow this message. &gt;&gt; The benefits is not just to get in heaven. &gt;&gt; The benefit of the message started from here. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All you have to do claim your loved one, put them there, take your hand off and let God pull them the way God knows that is best to bring them to heaven. &gt;&gt; Sometime God knew that that boy needed the cross to get where he's supposed to be. &gt;&gt; We wanted him a church. God say no, he's not going to come to church. He's going to come through the cross through that suffering as he's dying as a criminal. That is his entrance toward heaven. &gt;&gt; Take your hand off your faith. Lose up your faith. This faith is unlimited &gt;&gt; and there is nothing that is impossible to God. No matter even if your brain got stuck, stop. &gt;&gt; Look at the faith. Just believe. Remember you say, "Father, I there is one day I prayed and I claimed this boy and I claimed this daughter of me. I know that you told me whatever I put in your hand, no one can plug them out. &gt;&gt; I don't care what the devil is doing, what the devil is showing me doing in their life, &gt;&gt; that's not my problem. My problem, I'm looking at the cross. Either we going to be like that father that was uh uh that that look at the nurse and say you are looking at the machine right there. Me I'm looking at the promise. So you have two choices depending on how you're looking at either you going to look at the circumstances and see what your son or what your loved one is doing or you're going to look at the cross and say that is not my problem. All I know I saw things happening in the life and the very last minute people are entering into heaven. the seed of God. Just know one thing, God will lose none of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Maybe you don't understand why you grew up in a certain family. Maybe you are the Joseph of the family. &gt;&gt; And it's going to take your faith &gt;&gt; to pull everybody into the family. &gt;&gt; So never neglect your faith. You could be the very Joseph of the family, the one that is there, the very centerpiece that will change everything in the family and God will work more with you to do a lot of things and you keep using your narrow mind because you want things the way you were preached or the way preacher so and so told you unlimited. God is unlimited. Amen. Claim and believe. Faith is your victory. Amen. When we are crying, we crying with hope. Why? Because one day we at least pray for that loved one. That's it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say they are mother that don't gone in glory and their prayer will answer when the mothers are in glory. How can you explain?

Let me see the &gt;&gt; wave your hand if &gt;&gt; that mean you depending on him tonight. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; But whatever it is you need tonight, we depending on him tonight. If you need scrimp tonight, he's here to deliver that. &gt;&gt; I believe he's here. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; We just want to say that we're glad to be here tonight on convention night. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. Um, like the like the prophet says, the Holy Ghost, you got the Holy Ghost, you can't wait for the church doors to open. &gt;&gt; You know, we we may can't get up here every Wednesday, but every chance I can is is I count it all joy. &gt;&gt; I count it all joy. If you can get your Bibles and turn to the book of Exodus, Exodus chapter 3, &gt;&gt; and we're going to start at verse 18. And when you get it, just just say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads for a moment of prayer before we read the scriptures. Dear heavenly father God, we just we come to you humbly tonight, oh father, knowing, oh Lord God, that you have met us here tonight, oh father, Lord God, we want to lay all our burdens out on the altar tonight, oh Father, oh Lord God, that whatever the needs of your people that's in this building tonight, oh Father, we trust and believe that you will meet every need tonight, oh Father, we pray, oh Lord God, that you will get me out of your way, oh Father, and let your Holy Spirit speak to your children tonight and Lord God, and bless the remaining of this service and we Lord God I have the ability that you have given me to open up this Bible oh Lord but it's going to take you to unfold these words oh Lord oh Lord God we give it back to you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen &gt;&gt; amen the book of Exodus chapter 3 verse 18 and it says is let me see what we can it says now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law this might this verse one I'm sorry I'm sorry chapter um chapter 3 verse one it said now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law the priest of Midian and he led the flock to the side of the desert and came to the mountain of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even to Heler. &gt;&gt; You can have your seats. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, if I look at the scripture tonight, I don't think it's by chance that Moses happened to be leading the flock of Jeff. Now, I I believe tonight that Moses was already going into his position. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And God was already training him to lead to be in a leading position. &gt;&gt; Now, believe that tonight. &gt;&gt; And it says that he led the flock to the backside of the desert. &gt;&gt; And he came to the mountain of God, &gt;&gt; even to Her. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And I want you to know notice tonight that without God, this is just an ordinary mountain. &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Without the presence of God, right? &gt;&gt; This is just an ordinary mountain. &gt;&gt; And my subject tonight is the benefits and the change of ministry in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The benefits. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And the change of ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we take that for granted and you know, we we we can come so complacent sometimes and get and get content when we're in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; And sometimes when the trials of lives come on us, we forget where we at. &gt;&gt; And and sometime God, like we say, we're leaning on God cuz he's right there. But sometimes tests and trials makes us forget that we're still in his presence. &gt;&gt; That we're still in his presence or not. So it don't Sometimes we get tripped up on our journey, &gt;&gt; but we are still in his presence. &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "All you got to do IS JUST GO GET BACK home where you got off at." &gt;&gt; So So we want to look at this tonight. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And it says, "And the verse two say, "And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him, &gt;&gt; and a flame of fire, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; out of the midst of a bush, &gt;&gt; and he looked &gt;&gt; and behold, the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Like I say it again, &gt;&gt; without the presence of the pillar of fire, this was just an ordinary bush. This was just an ordinary bush that me and you see from day to day. But because of the presence of the pillar of fire, this is not an ordinary pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; So we found out that this God was inside of this bush. &gt;&gt; So th this bush if if you want to if you want to look at the big picture, this bush was packing deliverance. &gt;&gt; Inside of this bush lay deliverance. &gt;&gt; INSIDE OF THIS BUSH ALSO LAID A WAY MAKER. INSIDE OF THIS BUSH WAS THE PRESENCE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; So I want to let you know tonight that God lives in YOU TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; SO INSIDE of you LAYS DELIVERANCE. &gt;&gt; BESIDE INSIDE OF YOU LAYS A WAY MAKER. &gt;&gt; DELIVERANCE IS THE CLOSEST SOMEBODY going to get to deliverance is through you right now. YOU GOT THE POWER TO GIVE OUT DELIVERANCE. WHY? BECAUSE GOD LIVES IN YOU TONIGHT. And verse three said, "And Moses said, &gt;&gt; I would not turn aside &gt;&gt; and see this great sight &gt;&gt; while this bush is not burnt." First of all, when God when God begin to call this man, he already started working on Moses. &gt;&gt; He already started working on Moses, and we know that's how God worked. But when you look at this scripture right here, &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Moses turned aside. &gt;&gt; So it was no coincidence that Moses turned aside because God God did something extraordinary. &gt;&gt; That's exactly &gt;&gt; to grab the attention of Moses. &gt;&gt; It's not every day that you walking around and see a a pillar of fire burning inside of a bush and the bush don't consume. &gt;&gt; Let let's get that straight tonight. This is not something you see every day while you out. So, first thing God wanted to do was get Moses' attention. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; So, he he used a sign to get Moses attention. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And he and he said, "And then that caused Moses to turn aside." Moses said, "I I think I'll turn aside and look at this burning bush that won't consume." &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And God called unto him &gt;&gt; out of the midst of the bush &gt;&gt; and said, "Moses, Moses." And he said, "Here am I." Now here comes the voice right &gt;&gt; behind the sign right &gt;&gt; and he said draw not knock not hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; For the place wherein thou standing is holy ground. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So the presence of God made made this ground holy. &gt;&gt; Like I said without the presence of God it was just an ordinary ground. &gt;&gt; So it's the presence of God tonight THAT MAKES THIS SANCTUARY holy tonight. It's the presence OF GOD IN YOUR LIVES THAT MAKES YOU holy tonight. &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus said, "There's no good in me but the father." &gt;&gt; In verse six, he says, "Moreover," he said, "I am the God of thy father, &gt;&gt; the God of Abraham, &gt;&gt; the God of Isaac, &gt;&gt; and the God of Jacob." &gt;&gt; And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God. Now God know exactly what he doing. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. &gt;&gt; First he gave Moses a sign. That's right. &gt;&gt; A a extraordinary sign &gt;&gt; to grab his attention. &gt;&gt; And then when Moses turned to the side, God give him a voice to confirm &gt;&gt; that it's him that's speaking to him. So what do we do? He he quotes the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Look look and see what he does. He quotes the scriptures. He said, he said, "I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." And Moses hid his face because he he RECOGNIZED THAT GOD QUOTED THE SCRIPTURES. HE SAID, "THIS GOT TO BE GOD." &gt;&gt; SEE, THE DEVIL IS NOT GOING TO QUOTE THE SCRIPTURES. &gt;&gt; And if he do quote it, he going to quote IT OUT OF CONTEXT. &gt;&gt; HE CAME to Jesus after his 40-day fast and he said, "IS IT NOT WRITTEN?" BUT BUT Jesus said IT ALSO WRITTEN THAT YOU SHALL NOT TEMPT THE LORD THY GOD. &gt;&gt; SEE he used the scriptures on Jesus but he didn't use it the right way. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says YOU GOT TO ALWAYS CATCH THAT VOICE BEHIND the sign. &gt;&gt; He say God ALWAYS GIVE YOU A SCRIPTURE VOICE BEHIND THAT SIGN TO VINDICATE IT. THAT IS HIM THAT'S SPEAKING to you. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Come on. Yes sir. In verse 7, he says, "And the Lord said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people, yes sir, &gt;&gt; which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their task masters, for I know their sorrows." &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So right there, there's deliverance just speaking out of a bush. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Deliverance. He's saying to bring them up out of the land into a good land &gt;&gt; and a large Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; into a land flowing with milk and honey. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Unto the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Parasites and the Hivites and the Jebusites. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is coming to me." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppressed them. And he tells them in verse 10, he said, "Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, watch this. Watch. Moses is going to be a natural man. He's going to respond like a natural man. He says, "And Moses said unto God, who am I that I should go into Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?" And he says, "Certainly, I will be with thee, &gt;&gt; and this shall be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee, when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God upon this mountain." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Moses said unto God, "Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, the God of your fathers have sent me unto you, and they shall say to me, what is his name? What shall I say unto thee?" See, Moses already know he was going to have problem with these people when he went down there. He already know that he had to he had to have something to God had to back him up when he go down there. He can't just go down there and say, "God sent me." &gt;&gt; He he already know it's going to take more than that. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And he said, he says, u what shall I say unto them? And and God said unto Moses, I am that I am. And he said, "Thus shall thou say unto the children of Israel, &gt;&gt; I am have sent me unto you." &gt;&gt; And I want you to catch this. Then God says, "Moreover, unto Moses." So God God remembered the promise that Joseph made to him. He's saying moreover until Moses that thou shall say unto the children of Israel, the Lord God your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob has sent me unto you. This is my name forever and this is my memorial unto all generations. &gt;&gt; And and see God knew that um Joseph made a oath and he told him that God was going to visit them. &gt;&gt; So So God was telling Moses that when you go to f first of all, let's back up. The signs that God gave Moses, they weren't just for Pharaoh. These signs was also for the children of Israel. So, so the signs that God gave Moses to perform when he went down, it it just want to prove to Pharaoh that God sent him down there, it was also to prove to the people. &gt;&gt; So, it had he had two reasons for the signs. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In verse 16, he said, "Go and gather the elders of Israel together." Watch what he says. and say unto them, the Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt. &gt;&gt; And he says, and I have said, I will bring you up out of the afflictions of Egypt, unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Parasites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, and to a land flowing with milk and honey. That's the promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. and they shall hearken to thy voice and thou shalt come thou and the elders of Israel and to the king of Egypt. He said, "And you shall say unto him, the Lord God of the Hebrews have met with us, and now let us go." See, God never addressed Pharaoh the way that he addressed the children of Israel. He said, "You tell Pharaoh that the Lord God of the Hebrews had met with us." He said, "Now let us go. We beseech thee three days journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God. Now in the message the angel of the Lord parag 1951 paragraph 26 but a Brandon say all right notice now he said that when God spoke to him he attracted his attention &gt;&gt; Yes sir &gt;&gt; by a pillar of fire &gt;&gt; that fell into a bush &gt;&gt; and he began to burn and pop and burn. He says, he said, "Now it looks like if it was fire, it would have scorched the bush or burned it." &gt;&gt; He said, "But it was a supernatural fire &gt;&gt; who could burn the bush and yet it will still be there." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'M THINKING TONIGHT OF A SUPERNATURAL, &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; GOD'S FLAME OF fire who could come down in the human heart, &gt;&gt; burn out all the sin, unbelief, and don't harm the person." He said, "But it purges him, &gt;&gt; make him grow greater, &gt;&gt; BE STRONGER, &gt;&gt; MORE FAITH." &gt;&gt; AND HE COMES TONIGHT IN THAT WAY. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; He says he come DOWN INTO A HUMAN BODY, DRIVE OUT THE POWER OF CANCER, &gt;&gt; a tumor, a cataract, &gt;&gt; tuberculosis with fire. He say heavenly holy spirit fire falling from God of heaven. &gt;&gt; He said why mine? That's no mystery. He say if he can burn imbre sin out, how much more can he burn cancer OUT BY THE SAME HOLY SPIRIT? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; He said we got witnesses on both sides, men and women who were once sinners, lost in sin. &gt;&gt; Come to the world speaking lies shaped in iniquity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now go to Exodus chapter 4. We're going to jump. I'm I'mma jump to save time. Go to Exodus chapter 4, &gt;&gt; verse one. Yes. &gt;&gt; And Moses answered and said, "But behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice, for they will say, the Lord have not impered thee." And see, he's telling him what the children of Israel were going to say. &gt;&gt; Cuz his first his first job was to convince the children of Israel that God sent him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That was his first mission. So when the Lord said unto him, "What is what is that in thine hand?" And he said, "A rod." And he said, "Cast it on the ground." and he cast it on the ground and it became a serpent and Moses fled from before it. See, now this is the beginning of Moses' ministry. &gt;&gt; This is the beginning of Moses ministry right here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God began to show him the signs that he would he would begin to perform once he got down there. &gt;&gt; And the Lord said, "Put forth thine hand and take it by the tail." And he put forth his hand and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand. that that may believe that the Lord God of th their fathers, the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob have appeared to thee. So God is saying they they're going to believe you when you do these signs when you go down there. And he said, "And the Lord said furthermore to him, put not thy hand into thy bosom." &gt;&gt; And he put his hand into his bosom. And when he took it out, behold, his hands were lepous and snow. And he said, "Put thy hand into thy bosom again." And he put his hand into th his bosom again, and he plucked it out of his bosom, and behold, it was turned again as his other flesh. &gt;&gt; And verse eight said, "And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, &gt;&gt; neither hearken to the voice of the first sign." &gt;&gt; He said, "That they will believe the voice of the latter sign." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He's saying, "It shall come to pass if they will not believe also these two signs. Neither hearken unto thy voice that thou shalt take the water of the river and pour it upon the dry land. He saying, "And the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land." That's right. &gt;&gt; Then in verse 10, he says, "And Moses said unto the Lord, oh my Lord, I am not eloquent." Moses making excuses. &gt;&gt; He said, "Neither here to hear for nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant, but I am slow of speech and of a slow tongue." So you can come up with all excuses you want, but when God chooses man, there's nothing you going to carry out the orders. &gt;&gt; There's no coincidence that you in this message. There's nothing that you can do to get away from this message. If this message is for you tonight, there's nothing that you can do to get out of it. YOU CAN TRY TO QUIT IF YOU WANT TO, but there's nothing that you can do to get out of it. &gt;&gt; And skip down to verse 15. He said, "And thou shalt speak unto him and put words in his mouth, and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what you shall do." &gt;&gt; He said, he says, "And and he shall be the spokes spokesman unto the people." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And he shall be even he shall be thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God. &gt;&gt; He said, "And thou shalt take this rod in thy hand wherewith thou shalt sign do signs." And Moses went and returned. Verse 18 said, "Moses went and returned to Jethro, his father-in-law, and said unto him, let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive." And Jethro said to Moses, "Go in peace." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "And the Lord said unto Moses and Midian, go return into Egypt, for all the men are dead which sought thy life." And Moses took his wife and his sons, and he and he set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the rod of God in his hand. Now the scriptures say Moses took the rod of God. &gt;&gt; Now in the beginning, this rod was was just an ordinary rod that Moses had. But because this rod went in the presence of God BECAUSE THIS ROD WAS LAID IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD, NOW IT'S no longer Moses Moses's rod. IT'S THE ROD OF GOD. SO ANYTIME YOU COME INTO THE PRESENCE OF GOD, WHATEVER YOU LAY BEFORE HIM, IT DON'T BELONG TO YOU ANYMORE. IT'S GOD. SO THAT'S WHY WE COMMITTED NOW TO LAY OUR BURDENS, ALL OUR PROBLEMS IN THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD. CUZ ONCE WE LAY THEM THERE, THEY NO LONGER BELONG TO US. &gt;&gt; ALL YOUR TESTES, ALL YOUR TRIALS, THEY NO LONGER BELONG TO YOU. SO ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS JUST LAY THEM IN HIS PRESENCE. Just put him in his presence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Put it in his presence. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the message, take the rod and gather the people. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. &gt;&gt; 1950 paragraphs 21. &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham saying that in that and the rod that Moses had in his hand, &gt;&gt; he said it was not the rod of Moses. &gt;&gt; He said it was the rod of God. He said it was God's judgment rod. &gt;&gt; He said Mo Moses held it out over Egypt and flies came up. He said he held it out and fleas came up. He said wherever he dumped this rod, it was a judgment rod. He said it brought judgment upon a disobedient people and the rod was Christ, the substitute for sin and sickness. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He said Moses took the judgment rod and smoked the rod to bring forth water. He said, "Therefore, it was the judgment rod of God that smoked Jesus and killed him." &gt;&gt; He said, "The innocent one and brought from him flowed the Holy Spirit to a perishing people." Now, he said, "That we have life." &gt;&gt; He said, "NO MORE DO WE SMITE the rock, but we speak to the rock." &gt;&gt; He said, and watch the nouns and pronouns. He said, if he said, "Speak to the rock, and it shall bring forth his water." &gt;&gt; Speak to the rock and it shall bring forth his water. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the book of Exodus 7:9, &gt;&gt; the Bible say, "When Pharaoh shall speak to you, when Pharaoh shall speak unto youhu, &gt;&gt; saying, show a miracle for you, then thou shall say unto Aaron, take the rod and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent." He says, "And Moses and Aaron went unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the Lord commanded." Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; And Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and he became a serpent. And we know and we know this story, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Janice and Jammers impersonated. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; This sign. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; And they went to the second sign and God um Moses began to call the frogs. He called he called the frogs out of the river and they impersonated these things. But what I want you to get tonight, as long as you in the presence of God, &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. and you a believer tonight. &gt;&gt; Somehow down the road, God is going to change your ministry. That's right. &gt;&gt; He's going to change your ministry. &gt;&gt; It's impossible for you to be stuck on the first and second pull. &gt;&gt; It's impossible FOR YOU TO STAY THERE. If you a believer tonight and you in THE PRESENCE OF GOD, AT SOME POINT OF YOUR LIFE, GOD IS GOING TO ELEVATE YOU AND PULL YOU UP HIGHER into the third pull BECAUSE THAT'S THE BRIDE OF CHRIST IS THE ONLY ONE THAT GOT A THIRD GEAR. ONLY THE IMPERSONATORS CAN GO NO FURTHER THAN THAT SECOND GEAR. BUT THE BRIDE OF CHRIST HAS AN EXTRA GEAR TONIGHT. AND GOD IS GOING TO MAKE SURE HE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU MAKE IT TO THAT THIRD LEVEL. WHY? BECAUSE HE SAW YOU GETTING THERE. &gt;&gt; SO WHY YOU IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD OR NOT? WHY ARE WE SO BASED TONIGHT? WHY YOU WON'T JUST ASK FOR WHATEVER YOU NEED TONIGHT? WHY YOU WON'T JUST SPEAK what you need tonight? THE ENEMY HAS TRAPPED US FOR SO LONG TILL WE DONE GOT CONTENT BELIEVING THAT WE GOT TO GO PRAY FOR EVERYTHING THAT WE GOT TO WE GOT TO GO FAST AND PRAY FOR EVERYTHING. BUT GOD SAY SPEAK. &gt;&gt; GOD SAY SPEAK TO THE ROCK. HOW LONG IT GOING TO TAKE YOU TO SPEAK TO THE ROCK? &gt;&gt; WE ARE IN HIS PRESENCE RIGHT NOW. HOW MANY OF Y'ALL POSSESS THE HOLY GHOST TONIGHT? IF YOU POSSESS THE HOLY GHOST, RAISE YOUR HAND TONIGHT. WELL, YOU ARE ETERNALLY IN GOD'S PRESENCE TONIGHT. SO YOU ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS JUST SPEAK TONIGHT. WHATEVER IT IS YOU NEED, YOU JUST SAY THE WORD TONIGHT. GOD IS RIGHT HERE IN YOUR PRESENCE. HE'S RIGHT HERE IN YOUR PRESENCE. IF YOU NEED DELIVERANCE, YOU SPEAK IT TONIGHT. IF YOU NEED TO BE HEALED, YOU SPEAKING TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; HE'S RIGHT HERE. &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT SO FAR-FETCHED OUT. &gt;&gt; REAL ETERNALLY IN HIS PRESENCE. I DON'T HAVE TO WAIT TILL I GET TO CHURCH TO BE IN HIS PRESENCE. I DON'T HAVE TO WAIT TILL I GO ON MY KNEES AND PRAY TO BE IN HIS PRESENCE. WHEN I GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT, I'M IN HIS PRESENCE. WHEN I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING, I'M IN HIS PRESENCE. WHEN I'M RIDING DOWN THE ROAD IN MY CAR, I'M IN HIS PRESENCE. WHEN I GO ON MY JOB, I'M IN HIS PRESENCE. SO THAT MEAN I CAN SPEAK WHEREVER I'M AT. &gt;&gt; WHEREVER YOU AT, YOU CAN JUST SPEAK THE WORD. &gt;&gt; AND SEE WHAT WE WAITING ON IS A SPECIAL ATMOSPHERE. &gt;&gt; YOU CREATE THE ATMOSPHERE. &gt;&gt; IF YOU WILL HUMBLE YOURSELF TONIGHT, YOU CREATE THE ATMOSPHERE. GOD GOD IS VEILED INSIDE OF YOU. &gt;&gt; THAT MEANS WHEREVER YOU GO, HE'S THERE. SO &gt;&gt; SPEAK TO HIM. TALK TO HIM LIKE A MAN. &gt;&gt; Talk to him like a man. &gt;&gt; And see this is the pressure of the en that the enemy puts on the believers cuz he brings so much pres pressure to he want you to forget that you were still in his presence. &gt;&gt; That's right. You may have tripped up and fall or failed today or or did something out the ordinary and he tells you that you you know you God left you or something. No, you're still in his presence. You just you just make it right. &gt;&gt; You just repent and MAKE IT RIGHT. BUT GOD IS ALWAYS THERE. HE'S RIGHT THERE. &gt;&gt; He's always there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's always there. And we begin when they begin to do the signs, we we notice that the impersonator, they they went so far, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They went so far. And we and we've seen in the scriptures that when when God God told u Moses to the dust &gt;&gt; and and and and they tried to imitate this and they found out they couldn't do that and they they said this is surely this got to be the finger of God. So, so God is God is not going to linger around too long with impersonators. &gt;&gt; He going to let them hang around for so long and after a while he going to shift gears because he got we are peculiar people tonight. We are different. WE GOT TO BE SEPARATED FROM THAT GROUP. &gt;&gt; We got to be separated from that group. &gt;&gt; And if you notice all the plagues that came in Egypt, &gt;&gt; the magi were never able to reverse the plagues. &gt;&gt; No. I'm going to stay right here for a minute. &gt;&gt; THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE POWER TO HEAL. &gt;&gt; THEY CALLED THE FROGS UP OUT OF THE RIVER, but it took MOSES TO SEND THEM BACK IN the river. &gt;&gt; And see, that's how the enemy do. He can put He CAN PUT YOU IN A CORNER, BUT HE CAN'T BRING YOU BACK OUT. SO THAT'S SO THAT'S WHERE GOD COMES IN AND HE TAKES US TO THAT NEXT level &gt;&gt; into a level THAT THEY CAN'T IMPERSONATE. &gt;&gt; And I look through the scriptures, I say, MOSES CALLED GOD CALLED THE FROGS OUT of the river. &gt;&gt; They did the same thing, but they couldn't make them return. So all they did was made their problem worse. &gt;&gt; All they DID WAS BRING MORE PROBLEMS UPON THEMSELVES. &gt;&gt; SO SO AN IMPERSONATOR, THAT'S ALL HE DOING IS BRINGING MORE MORE PROBLEMS ON THE SELF. THEY BRINGING MORE PROBLEMS ON ITSELF. &gt;&gt; ALL THEY doing is making his life miserable. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; These do not have the power to heal. &gt;&gt; Now we and now we're looking at this ministry of Moses. This this this ministry went down there and it did two things. It did two things. It delivered &gt;&gt; the children of Israel. &gt;&gt; It opened their eyes &gt;&gt; that he was the deliverer. But it also blinded Pharaoh and the Egyptians. That's right. &gt;&gt; So, so this this ministry that went down there, it had a two-fold purpose. &gt;&gt; It saved his people, but it also blinded the enemy. &gt;&gt; And and thanks for the Holy Ghost Sunday through, Brother Stephen. I I I was looking I like PHARAOH TRIED. &gt;&gt; HE TRIED TO LET THE people go, &gt;&gt; but his heart was hardened. And and I and I looked through the scripture and I asked God, I said, "Lord, why didn't he just LET HIM GO, &gt;&gt; BUT I FOUND OUT SUDDENLY THROUGH THE HOLY GHOST, 10 WAS A BAD NUMBER &gt;&gt; and 10 was the NUMBER OF THE ENEMY." SO GOD HELD THAT THING OUT TO 10 PLAGUES. &gt;&gt; 10 PLAGUES &gt;&gt; CUZ HE COULD HAVE LET HIM GO. &gt;&gt; WHY 10 PLAGUES? &gt;&gt; WHY 10 PLAGUES? &gt;&gt; AND THE HOLY SPIRIT OPENED THAT UP. I SAID, "OH, NOW I SEE WHY IT HAD TO BE 10 place cuz Pharaoh WANTED TO LET HIM GO BEFORE THAT." SO WHY DID GOD HOLD THIS THING GOT TO 10 PLACE? &gt;&gt; Brother Bren, &gt;&gt; I never seen that quote. Brother Brandon say, "It's a bad number. It's the number of the enemy." &gt;&gt; And Pharaoh was the enemy. &gt;&gt; He tried to let him go. He went and and and Pharaoh was crying and he would ask Moses to go back and retreat to God. He would tell God to take the curse off. &gt;&gt; Every every plague, &gt;&gt; he would go to Moses, tell Moses to go to God and remove it because God is the only one that can heal. That actually was that actually was a demonstration of healing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was a demonstration of healing. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; In the message shalom &gt;&gt; 1964 &gt;&gt; paragraph 173 &gt;&gt; brother Baron said when when we hear the symphony beating &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; changing &gt;&gt; fixing to change. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; He said it's a junction time. &gt;&gt; He said we notice as he began to beat &gt;&gt; and we seen the works that I do shall you do also. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; And greater shall you do. &gt;&gt; He says greater &gt;&gt; he promised it. We wonder how it could be. &gt;&gt; He said, "But you notice when he performed his first miracle, sir. &gt;&gt; He took water and turned it to wine." &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; He said he took water, which potentially someday might have been wine. &gt;&gt; He said, "But it was water first." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said, "And when he fed 5,000, &gt;&gt; what did he do?" &gt;&gt; He took something that had been like water. HE TOOK A FISH THAT ONCE swam &gt;&gt; and was born from an egg. &gt;&gt; He said he broke it &gt;&gt; and another fish grow into the creation &gt;&gt; that was the original creation. &gt;&gt; He said he took the bread that once was wheat. &gt;&gt; He said it was a seed and be and it became bread and he broke from this bread and the creation only multiplied. &gt;&gt; He said but in the woods there HE SAID THERE WAS NOTHING THERE TO MAKE A SQUIRREL. WATCH THE CHANGING OF THE MINISTRY. &gt;&gt; He said THERE WAS NOTHING THERE TO MAKE a squirrel. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "LET THERE BE." &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "AND THERE WAS." &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "WITHOUT ANYTHING TO BREAK IT FROM." &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "WHAT IS IT?" He He say IT'S THE SAME JESUS CHRIST. SEE, &gt;&gt; greater things than this will you do. He said, "For I go to my father, &gt;&gt; NOT TAKE SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN CREATED, break something from it, and multiply a creation." He said, "But absolutely create." &gt;&gt; HE SAY, SHOWING THAT HE'S THE SAME JEHOVAH THAT STOOD BACK THERE AND SAID, "LET THERE BE." &gt;&gt; HE SAY, "AND THERE WAS." HE SAY HIS WORD WAS MADE MANIFEST. He said when he was made flesh on earth, he took his original creation. HE SAY HE BROKE IT BACK and multiplied it. He said now but in the last days &gt;&gt; WHEN HE COMES DOWN AMONG US again he said he said that same LIGHT THAT MOVED DOWN SAID LET there be light. &gt;&gt; See he just speak the creation into existence. HE SAID GREATER THAN THIS WILL you do. &gt;&gt; FOR I GO TO MY FATHER REMEMBER. &gt;&gt; He said REMEMBER WE ARE AT THESE TIMES. And if you notice when mo when Moses went down to Egypt, God never revealed himself in Egypt in the form of the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; He He never did it there. He waited till he called his people out. He separated them. He took him back to the mountain. THAT'S WHEN HE FIRST SPOKE. THAT'S WHEN HE delivered a pillow of fire. He spoke out of the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Believe you must &gt;&gt; in the message show us the father and it suffices. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 51 in 1950. He said he was a god man. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; He said I believe he was the infinite son of God. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. born of the Virgin Mary. &gt;&gt; That's right. He said everything the Bible said he was, I believe he was. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He said he was on earth. He looked like God. &gt;&gt; He talked like God. &gt;&gt; He preached like God. &gt;&gt; And he rose like God. &gt;&gt; He ascended like God. &gt;&gt; God was in him. &gt;&gt; God manifested here in a body of flesh. &gt;&gt; On the earth in a form, &gt;&gt; his son Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And brother Bon say notice. He said God was in his son. &gt;&gt; He was always He said God deals back there in the beginning when he was with the Israelites coming through the wilderness. He said there was a rock going along there following them. A spiritual rock. That's right. &gt;&gt; He said GOD TOLD MOSES SMITE the rock &gt;&gt; and it'll bring forth water. &gt;&gt; Now brother B say what was it? He said he smoked it with the rod that was in his hand. &gt;&gt; He said that rod wasn't Moses rod. That that was God's rod. the judgment. &gt;&gt; He say and he smoked the rock and the rock brought forth the water. &gt;&gt; Now this is the same rock that he smoked with the judgment rock with the judgment rod. This is the same rock that Christ was standing upon. &gt;&gt; He say and when one time they wanted a drink, they went to the rock. &gt;&gt; He said when they wanted something to eat, they went down and a bunch of bees had a hive in there. He say in the rock there was a cliff. God stood in the cliff. The bees had their nest in the cliff. He says, he said, "Anything that had anything they had need of, they went to the rock." And the Bible clearly teaches that Christ was that rock that was in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; He said, "If you're thirsty tonight, go to the rock." &gt;&gt; He said, "If you want honey, sweetness, go to the rock." He said, "IF YOU WANT LIFE, GO TO THE ROCK." He said, "If you want to believe God was in his son, go to the rock." He was in the rock. SPEAK TO THE ROCK. HE SAID, "IT'LL BRING FORTH this waters." He said, "There you are, God and his people." &gt;&gt; Yes, SIR. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; God and his people. &gt;&gt; In the book of St. John chapter 14, &gt;&gt; verse 17, the Bible says, "Even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive &gt;&gt; because it seeth him not, neither know of him." He said, "But ye shall know him, for he dwelleth with you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; "And shall be in you." Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what I was talking about earlier. If he dwelleth in you, that mean you eternally forever in his presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And verse 18 say, I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you. Yet a little while and the world seeth me no more, but you see me. &gt;&gt; He said, because I live, you shall live also. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the message fellowship 1960 paragraph 122 brother but Brenham says Jesus once for all one time he was perfected forever &gt;&gt; that's that have come into that fellowship with an eternal blessing &gt;&gt; eternal fellowship with the eternal presence of God &gt;&gt; with the power of the Holy Ghost not in a symbol out yonder or in some word or in some theology but the Holy Ghost in you. He said the power of God that raised Christ from the grave is made alive in you &gt;&gt; and you are a new creature &gt;&gt; then you are a son and daughter of God oh brother that's it he said and it takes the blood of Jesus Christ to stare it takes the power the life that was in that blood sir in the book of Ephesians chapter 3 verse 20 he says it says now unto him that is able to do is seeding &gt;&gt; that's abundantly &gt;&gt; above all THAT WE ASK OR THINK. &gt;&gt; ACCORDING TO THE POWER THAT WORKKETH in us, &gt;&gt; it say unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To him that is that is able to do exceedingly abundantly. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So he he's telling you what he's able to do. He's he's exceedingly and he can he can do it abundantly &gt;&gt; ABOVE ALL THAT YOU CAN ask for. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and and we we know the scripture mean that mean you can't even think of nothing &gt;&gt; that he can't exceed. &gt;&gt; So whatever you can grasp your mind on tonight, God said he can go higher than that. &gt;&gt; SO WHY WHY WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO SPEAK TONIGHT? &gt;&gt; Why wouldn't you want to speak in the presence of GOD TO A GOD LIKE THAT THAT TELLS YOU THAT WHATEVER YOU ASK FOR TONIGHT THAT HE CAN exceed that. &gt;&gt; SO SO YOU MIGHT ASK FOR A LITTLE PORTION BUT GOD MAY GIVE YOU DOUBLE. AND SO WE FOUND OUT THAT WHEN ELIJAH WHEN ELISHA WAS IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD, ELISHA ASKED FOR A DOUBLE PORTION. SO NOW THAT I LOOK IN THE SCRIPTURE TONIGHT, IF IF ELISHA IS ABLE TO ASK FOR A DOUBLE PORTION, THAT MEAN I CAN ASK FOR MORE THAN that cuz there's no limit. &gt;&gt; ELISHA WAS LED TO ASK FOR A DOUBLE PORTION. NOW I ASK YOU A QUESTION TONIGHT. WHAT ARE YOU LED TO ASK FOR TONIGHT? WHAT are you LAYING TO ASK FOR TONIGHT? WHAT ARE YOUR HEART TELLING YOU THAT YOU CAN HAVE TONIGHT? &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOUR HEART SAYING THAT BELONGS TO YOU TONIGHT? I SAY SPEAK THE WORD TONIGHT. You speak what you need tonight. GOD GOD IS DOING SOMETHING RIGHT NOW. AND WE WE GOT TO GET TO THIS LEVEL. WE GOT TO GET TO THIS THIRD PULL LEVEL. THERE'S NO COINCIDENCE THAT GOD IS KEEP TALKING ABOUT THE third pull. THAT MEANS SOMEBODY IT'S TIME FOR SOMEBODY TO SHIFT GEARS. IT'S TIME FOR SOMEBODY TO PUT THEIR FAITH INTO ACTION. IT'S TIME FOR SOMEBODY TO TAKE GOD AT HIS WORD. IT WE ARE THE BRIDE OF CHRIST. WE THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN TAP INTO THIS. &gt;&gt; SO GOD GOT ANGRY. GOD GOT ANGRY WITH Moses &gt;&gt; when they came back to the rock &gt;&gt; and and and Moses went to crying and complaining because the children of Israel wanted something to drink again and brother Bren say you would have think &gt;&gt; that the children of Israel would have mentioned to Moses say why don't you just speak &gt;&gt; to the rock BECAUSE YOU DONE DID ALL THESE SIGNS why don't you just speak to the rock &gt;&gt; but the truth is they couldn't go no further than what it was being led &gt;&gt; see everything that Moses did down in Egypt Moses spoke spoke what God told him to speak. &gt;&gt; There's a difference. &gt;&gt; There's a difference. God spoke to Moses. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And Moses delivered to Aaron. &gt;&gt; But the original voice came from God himself. &gt;&gt; So this is a change of the ministry for Moses. &gt;&gt; So So Moses was sitting there waiting on God. &gt;&gt; And brother Bren say he KNOW GOD JUST PROBABLY GOT FED UP WITH MOSES. He say, "Why is you crying and complaining? Why don't you just speak to the rock? &gt;&gt; But but the truth is THAT WAS A CHANGE in Moses ministry. That was something new to Moses. Moses was JUST REPEATING WHAT GOD SAID. BUT NOW GOD IS GOD IS SAYING, "I WANT YOU TO JUST SPEAK TO IT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME to me no more, Moses. YOU DON'T HAVE TO SPIKE THE ROCK WITH THE ROD NO MORE, MOSES. ALL FROM HERE ON OUT, MOSES. ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS JUST SPEAK TO THE ROCK, MOSES. AMEN. SO, so we look and and and even with sickness and and things, we we we change ministry with with how we look at things and how we handle it. That's right. &gt;&gt; If if if we go to the doctor and the doctor says, "You got this problem, you got that problem, we're going to have to do surgery." &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; And and that's not the way it got to go. I mean, just because he say you got to have surgery don't mean it got TO GO OUT THAT WAY. &gt;&gt; SO, so I'm like I'm thinking ABOUT JOSHUA WHEN HE WAS IN THE BATTLE. &gt;&gt; And Joshua say he had a battle to fight and he had a battle to win. &gt;&gt; SO JOSHUA DIDN'T JOSHUA DIDN'T PRAY TO GOD. &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO PRAY TO GOD. HE DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO FAST. SO, SO I'M THINKING IN JOSHUA MIND AT SOME POINT JOSHUA HAD TO SAY WITHIN HIMSELF, WHAT DO I have need of right now? WHAT DO I HAVE NEED OF RIGHT NOW IN THE MIDST OF this battle? And when JOSHUA BEGAN TO THINK ON THESE THINGS, WHAT DO I HAVE NEED OF? I SEE THE SUN IS GOING DOWN AND THIS BATTLE IS NOT OVER WITH. I NEED MORE DAYLIGHT. HE BEGAN TO THINK WHAT HE NEEDED TO WIN THE BATTLE. &gt;&gt; AND BUTTER AND BUTTER SAY SOMETIMES YOU CAN JUST SAY THE RIGHT THING. &gt;&gt; HE SAID SOMETIMES YOU CAN JUST SAY THE RIGHT THING and and it would trigger God to come ON THE SCENE LIKE HAD IT RIGHT. SHE SAID THE RIGHT THING. HE SAID he said then Joshua just begin to speak to the son. HE SAID SON STAND STILL AND SAY NOT ONLY JUST STAND STILL BUT HE looked back at the moon and say you stay WHERE YOU AT. SEE, JOSHUA BEGAN TO SPEAK BECAUSE HE KNOW WHAT HE had need of. &gt;&gt; AND WHY? WHAT LED UP TO him beginning to speak like that? Because Joshua know that God made him a promise. He knew that the pro that that land was over there flowing with milk and honey. And he knew that God was going to take him over there. &gt;&gt; But catch the concept. At some point in that in that battle, Joshua had to think, "What do I need?" Right. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So I ask you tonight, what you what do you need tonight? &gt;&gt; What do you have need of? &gt;&gt; THAT'S THAT'S WHERE IT ALL STARTS AT. WHAT DO YOU HAVE NEED OF? &gt;&gt; And then once you can LAY THAT OUT BEFORE GOD AND THEN you can begin to speak that whatever it is you need to make THAT THING COME TO PASS, &gt;&gt; THEN YOU BEGIN TO move things, YOU GOT THE POWER TO MOVE THINGS OUT OF THE WAY. &gt;&gt; I call I call it customization. You can customize. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE YOUR DELIVERANCE. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE YOUR DELIVERANCE. I DON'T CARE HOW SO AND SO GOT DELIVERED. I DON'T CARE HOW THIS BROTHER GOT DELIVERED, BUT I CAN CUSTOMIZE MY OWN DELIVERANCE. &gt;&gt; If the IF THE DOCTOR SAY I GOT TO HAVE SURGERY, I CAN CUSTOM I CAN MOVE THAT THING AROUND. &gt;&gt; SAY NO, I CAN BE HEALED WITHOUT SURGERY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; If if you need if you need anything from God and sickness, LIKE I CHALLENGE YOU TONIGHT. IF YOU NEED A A new heart tonight, if you need a new kidney tonight, &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE WHAT IT IS YOU NEED. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN BEGIN TO CUSTOMIZE THAT THING. &gt;&gt; You You CAN BEGIN TO CUSTOMIZE IT. MY BIBLE TELL ME THAT GOD SAID HE WILL RESTORE. &gt;&gt; SO WHO SAID YOU GOT TO GO THROUGH SURGERY? GOD PROMISED RESTORATION. &gt;&gt; SO I BELIEVE &gt;&gt; THAT GOD CAN TAKE THAT SAME KIDNEY. &gt;&gt; GOD CAN TAKE THAT SAME HEART AND BEGIN TO RESTORE. &gt;&gt; It's what you believe tonight. &gt;&gt; It's what you believe tonight. IT'S WHAT YOU BELIEVE tonight &gt;&gt; there. THERE THERE'S NO BLUEPRINT WHEN IT COME DOWN TO YOU AND YOUR LIFE WITH GOD. EVERYBODY EVERYBODY EXPERIENCE WITH GOD IS DIFFERENT. &gt;&gt; SO THERE SO DON'T DON'T FOCUS ON WHAT GOING ON WITH EVERYBODY ELSE. You look down in your heart AND YOU ASK YOURSELF WHAT IT IS THAT YOU NEED. WHAT do you need GOD TO DO? HOW YOU NEED GOD to do it? when you need God to do it AND YOU BEGIN TO SPEAK OFF OF THAT. YOU BEGIN TO SPEAK IT OUT THERE. &gt;&gt; SPEAK IT OUT THERE. PUT IT OUT THERE. &gt;&gt; PUT IT OUT THERE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; There's benefits being in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we don't take advantage of it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You in you're in his presence right now. Every time you you walk in here, you you walk into his presence and and and we don't take advantage of it. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; WHILE he's here tonight, &gt;&gt; this is the time to to lay it out. &gt;&gt; This is the time to lay it out. When that inspiration strikes you, &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHEN YOU LAY IT OUT. &gt;&gt; BROTHER B SAID, "WHEN THAT inspiration hit you, that's when YOU SAY THE RIGHT THING. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHEN YOU SPEAK THE RIGHT THING. And then IT THEN IT'LL HAPPEN JUST LIKE YOU SAID IT THAT you wanted to happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; In the book of Mark, &gt;&gt; chapter 11, &gt;&gt; yes, sir. Verse 23. &gt;&gt; The Bible say, "For verily I say unto you, &gt;&gt; that whosoever &gt;&gt; shall say unto this mountain, &gt;&gt; be thou removed &gt;&gt; be removed, &gt;&gt; and be thou cast into the sea, &gt;&gt; AND SHALL NOT DOUBT &gt;&gt; IN HIS HEART, &gt;&gt; BUT SHALL believe that those THINGS WHICH HE SAYING SHALL COME TO PASS." &gt;&gt; He said, HE SHALL HAVE WHATSOEVER HE SAITH. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "THEREFORE I SAY UNTO YOU, YEAH. &gt;&gt; WHAT THINGS SOEVER YOU DESIRE? &gt;&gt; I ASK YOU THAT TONIGHT. WHAT THINGS THAT YOU DESIRE TONIGHT? &gt;&gt; What do you desire tonight? &gt;&gt; He said, "WHEN YOU PRAY, BELIEVE THAT YOU RECEIVE them &gt;&gt; and you shall have them." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the message, Conference with God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; 1959, paragraph 101. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "That's what's the matter with the church today." HE SAID GOD CALLS you and he wants to give you a gift after gift &gt;&gt; and power after power &gt;&gt; and grace after grace. &gt;&gt; He said but you organize yourself then. He said I CAN'T GO ANY FURTHER. &gt;&gt; He said but he said BECAUSE THE CHURCH WON'T let me see. He said there's no halting place in God. &gt;&gt; No place for denomination. He said there's no place for any certain standard. He said the thing of IT IS IS GO FORWARD. HE SAID, "SPEAKS GOD WORD AND GO FORWARD." &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "JUST KEEP ON GOING. &gt;&gt; Keep moving." HE SAID, "GOD SAYS IT RIGHT. IT'S RIGHT." &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "YOU GOT YOUR COMMISSION." So the B commission is just to speak the word and move forward. &gt;&gt; That's all you obligated to do tonight is just speak the word and move forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that WAS THE THAT THAT'S ALL GOD WAS trying to tell Moses in his ministry. He went down there with the signs. But eventually after a certain period of time, God had to change the music seat. &gt;&gt; He's like, "I can't let you stay here. &gt;&gt; You you you must go higher." &gt;&gt; Because because to get raptured in faith &gt;&gt; and to get in the position for you to be in your um positionally placed, &gt;&gt; then you got to tap into this. &gt;&gt; And and and all it is is you knowing who you are. knowing that the same God &gt;&gt; that split the Red Sea that he lives in you. &gt;&gt; And that's what God was telling Moses. No longer that you have to come to me and ask me to do this thing. I'm trying to get you to understand that I am in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now I'm looking through the through the message now. Even even the prophet even brother Brennham say he struggled with this scripture. &gt;&gt; Even brother Brandham said he struggled &gt;&gt; with with this scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm trying to I'm trying to skip the same time. &gt;&gt; Oh man. as uh in the message my new ministry &gt;&gt; brother Bernham says &gt;&gt; he said blessed be the kingdom of our father David that cometh in the name of the Lord hosana in the highest &gt;&gt; he said and Jesus entered into Jerusalem and into the temple and when he had looked around upon all things and now evening time was come he went out into Bethany with his 12. He said, "And on the tomorrow when they would come to Bethany, he was hungry, &gt;&gt; and he seen a fig tree fall off having leaves. &gt;&gt; He came if happily he might he might find anything there on &gt;&gt; and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, &gt;&gt; for the time of figs was not yet." &gt;&gt; So Jesus answered and said unto him, "No man eatth fruit of thee hereafter forever." &gt;&gt; And his disciples heard it. He's saying they came to Jerusalem and Jesus went into the temple and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrow the tables of the money changers and the seats of them that sold does. And he says it will not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple. He said and he taught saying unto them, "Is it not written, my house shall be called of all nations, no the house of prayer?" He said, "But you have made it a den of thieves." He say, "And the scribes and the chief priests heard it and sought how they might destroy him, for they feared him because all were astonished at his doctrine." And we going, we're going to go down, skip down to when he says, he says, "For verily I," he he read the scripture. He said ver for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he said &gt;&gt; therefore I say unto you what things soever you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them &gt;&gt; now brother Benham say what a gracious promise &gt;&gt; he said and it is absolutely the truth &gt;&gt; absolutely &gt;&gt; now listen what Butter Ber say Ber say this stumped in me. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God say this scripture stumped him. &gt;&gt; He said for as I shall use that expression for a long time. He say how could that be? &gt;&gt; He said one time when I first started preaching here at the tabernacle many years ago. He said he said I run into the word of hell. He said I run into the reference to it many times and I referred to the Hades and the Greek which meant the grave. He said I don't know what to say. He said, "Because I do not want to be responsible for men's souls at the day of the judgment." He said, "So I searched it and I searched until I found that it was just the truth." He said, "About four or five years, I would not touch that subject of hell until I found what was the truth about." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He said, "And then this scripture stumped me." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He said, "Even more because I was outstanding such a promise. It was an outstanding promise." He said, "Being made by one other than Jesus Christ." He said, "And when he had said to his disciples, what things soever you say you can have," he said, "If thou shall say to this mountain, be plucked up and removed into the sea, and will not doubt in your heart, but shall believe that what you have said will come to pass." He said, "You can have what you said." And brother Bren say, "Oh, oh, if we could weigh those words," &gt;&gt; he said, "You can have what you say." &gt;&gt; He said, "Now what I say, not what I say, but what you have said." He said you can have what you say. &gt;&gt; And brother Bernham say for years &gt;&gt; he say I lingered over that. That's right. &gt;&gt; He said I went to every Lexon commentary every translation. He says even to the Dewey version he says and every translator translates it the same. He said you can have what you say. &gt;&gt; He say so I know if it's written in the scripture &gt;&gt; to me. He said all scripture is true. He said, HE SAID, "IF I CAN'T RIGHTLY DIVIDE IT, it's still the truth." &gt;&gt; So even if you don't believe it or not, it's still the truth. &gt;&gt; If you don't believe that you can have what you say you want tonight OR NOT, IT'S STILL THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; That's what Butter Brenam is saying. He He's saying IT'S STILL THE GOD WORD IS STILL THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; But it's only true to you if you can take hold of it and believe &gt;&gt; and have faith in it. So butter benom believe he at one point he struggled with that scripture sir &gt;&gt; that you can have whatever it is that you say &gt;&gt; he he he he he struggled with that before the atonement he got that down in there he said he could he struggled with that because he looked on the other side of the atonement and he noticed that disciples were doing these things say but he came to a realization that it was God in God was stepping inside that body &gt;&gt; and it wasn't him speaking &gt;&gt; THAT IT WAS GOD SPEAKING And he SAY GOD GOD DEALT WITH HIM with that for a while. And he say and and he said he his first part of his ministry he came to pray for the sick &gt;&gt; and he he began to do those same two signs that Moses had on the mountain. &gt;&gt; Same two signs. He said God spoke to him out of a bush. When he was in the woods he said God spoke to him out of bush. &gt;&gt; And when God spoke to him out of the bush the same thing that God did. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. When he spoke to him, he gave him a scripture. A voice came out and it was a scripture that he quoted. &gt;&gt; Say what it is. He said, "Ask whatever you need." He quoted that scripture to brother Banner. &gt;&gt; And brother Brener knew that it was him because the scripture that he quoted was in the scriptures. &gt;&gt; And he and brother Bham said he began to look over his ministry and he asked God and say, "Are you getting ready to change my ministry?" &gt;&gt; He said, "Are you getting ready to change my ministry?" &gt;&gt; And and and you know the story. From there on out, God began to deal with him and he began to speak. &gt;&gt; He began to speak. &gt;&gt; I think the first time is um God told him to um there was going to be a resurrection of a of a small animal &gt;&gt; and he told him to speak to the fish, little fish. And from there, he went to speak to squirrels into existence. &gt;&gt; So God was changing his ministry. &gt;&gt; So if you brought to Christ or not, &gt;&gt; God is going to change your ministry. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what I want. That's what I That's what I want to drive tonight. God is going to If he hadn't changed it yet, you it's impossible for you not to be changed. He's going to change it. &gt;&gt; IF YOU HAVE NOT TAPPED INTO THAT, &gt;&gt; he's going to get you there. &gt;&gt; He's going to get you there. &gt;&gt; You get ready because you got to get there &gt;&gt; because he saw he saw us at this level and and we're going to get there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Y'all bless the word. Let's stand as we pray. Come on, brother Stephen. &gt;&gt; It's benefits in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; His benefits in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't go home like that. You need to go home with something. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The benefit and the change of the ministry. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is something whether you believe it or not, it's going to happen. &gt;&gt; Uh the bride cannot be 50, 40, 60 years like this and keep doing the same thing over and over and we keep being cry babies and things like that. Uh-uh. It's not going to happen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. the level God open up the word, it's already telling you where God is &gt;&gt; because the word because the word is the measuring thing. &gt;&gt; So when when God open up the word, it tells you which level God is moving. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; First pool, how long are you going to stay under the first P? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They taught brother Brham that his wife need to have surgery. &gt;&gt; But brother Brham never stopped praying. That's correct. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham never say, "Okay, she's going to have a surgery. Let me leave it alone." No, Brother Brandham keep praying while the date of the surgery was approaching. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The dirt of I mean the date of the surgery was approaching and he was praying until the inspiration hit him &gt;&gt; and brother Brandham spoke &gt;&gt; and when he spoke they took his wife all the way to surgery. That's right. &gt;&gt; They even prepare his wife &gt;&gt; when they were getting ready &gt;&gt; to bring the surgical knife. That's when God came and removed that thing right there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Because somebody already spoke. &gt;&gt; The doctor can continue to do what they want to do all the checkup or the test whatever. You hold on to what you spoke &gt;&gt; and let God meet the doctor somewhere and prove to the doctor that he is still the same yesterday, today, and forever. Be ready somehow in your life. There got to be a change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you don't know what a change is, remember you were a baby. &gt;&gt; And remember, today you're not a baby anymore. So something happened to you. &gt;&gt; Maybe you had a little voice, now you got a big voice. Something happened to you. If you don't understand what a change is, look at you today. Many of us, we were skinny and everything. Look at us today. A change happen. Something happened. Whatever something happened. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, whatever, a change will happen. &gt;&gt; So, just be ready for the change. Amen. And this is a spiritual change. God is getting ready to do something. It's a shift in a ministry. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it tells you how deep you are going with God. &gt;&gt; The deeper you going with God in your relationship, the more you're going to see God unfold himself in a supernatural way. At the beginning, your faith was, I need to kneel down a certain way and pray, then God will hear me. After a while, you don't have a time to kneel. You begin to pray. Even though when you're driving your car, after a while you begin to understand God more and you begin to develop an experience or a relationship with God where a certain point, how are you going to kneel down when you're fighting? &gt;&gt; How are you going to talk to God when you're in the midst of the battle? &gt;&gt; How are you going to do it? Joshua didn't have any way to stand there and begin to kne the I mean sword and uh and uh and arrows are flying every day. There is no time to sit down and to look for I mean a I'm in a certain uh position to start. No, you got to speak &gt;&gt; and you move on. If you don't want to speak, God will push you to a corner where you will speak. Where you will sit down and you say, "I'm tired of this situation. Enough is enough. I'm going to speak and then I'm going to believe God no matter what happened. I'm going to move forward and from this day my life is going to change." Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; This this sermon is too deep than even you think. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It came in a different way the way God wanted it to come but it's too deep. Amen. &gt;&gt; This can be even apply in the marriages. &gt;&gt; It can even apply in your life. &gt;&gt; There is a shift that happen in marriages. &gt;&gt; But we are usually not aware of it. We behaving with our husband like we were married with them the way we were married 50 years. &gt;&gt; All right, it's time to go home. Amen. Amen. Because the woman or the sister never understood the shift of the ministry. &gt;&gt; The man that you live with him for that you live with him for five years is no longer the same man. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Things have shifted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you're still living like he was the same man. &gt;&gt; And sometime he shows you sign but you still don't catch sign. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ah let's go home. Amen. We will deal with this one day. You will understand the shift of this thing in a marriage. And what if if you catch the shift, &gt;&gt; you will begin. You won't have to argue with your husband. &gt;&gt; You don't even have to insist to make your point. &gt;&gt; If you understand the shift, &gt;&gt; if you understand that this time this man has shifted, what our relationship have shifted, all you have to say will be I wish I have the water of Jerusalem &gt;&gt; and that's it. uh he will be the one pulling the sword &gt;&gt; and fighting through &gt;&gt; and they will bring it to you. But you don't believe it. You don't even believe it yourself first. The problem is you don't believe it. You got stuck with my husband. Whenever I tell him something, he won't do it. You miss the shift. &gt;&gt; You didn't understand. And he's waiting for you to Men are different. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. A man will leave $200 because God is a man. &gt;&gt; A man will leave $200 on the on the on the counter &gt;&gt; and then when you come you say who is this $200? He say it's mine and it depends what you're going to do. &gt;&gt; And it depend on which level of the shift you are. &gt;&gt; One will pick up and say you know what I take it. It's mine. &gt;&gt; And find out if he will come to pick it up. He won't. But if you leave that, he will take it. &gt;&gt; All right, let's go home. If you leave it right there, he will take it back and he will find a bill to pay. &gt;&gt; But if you take it, he won't come back to you and say, "Get it." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he's already aware that you're the one that took it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And sometime he did it purposely. And God does the same thing. &gt;&gt; He walk with you on Emas and he act like he's gone. &gt;&gt; Is up to you to understand and say, "Hey, he told them he's leaving." &gt;&gt; But so when they told him when they constrained him stay, why did he say if he was going? &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm asking you a question. Why did he stay? &gt;&gt; He said he was leaving. So why did God stay when they constrain him? He should have said, "No, no, no. Me, God, when I speak, I don't take my word back. I'm God. &gt;&gt; You see now, you see now, &gt;&gt; you see now understand this. Put that in the spiritual level and you will see what God want." &gt;&gt; We want God to push every button for us and we will be a lazy people sitting can do nothing. God is standing waiting on you until you understand that you need to put your hand and take what belongs to you and walk out. And when you do that, you will hear God clapping hands say finally they understood what I was trying to say. For five, six years, I was trying to tell them they can do this themselves. They don't understand. That's the reason why Brandham say God got angry toward Moses. That's right. &gt;&gt; A prophet that come to ask for help and God is yelling at the prophet. Why? because he keep doing things, keep doing things and he thought okay this time Moses will understand that he doesn't need to come back because he already did so many miracle he doesn't need to ask me and Moses keep coming back but keep coming I say the only way he can understand is a yet he yell at Moses and Moses say oh so what should I do he say what do you ask me you need to do you already know what to do this is where we are now this is where we getting with God is going to hand everything back he already delivered the faith God is handing everything back to you &gt;&gt; to do what you got to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what the word of God say? Do do it. &gt;&gt; Don't sit there and say okay let me hear that voice. When that voice will say go and I will go. There is a time you have to do that. After a while you already understand God is with me. My husband love me. I know that he love me. I know that this is my husband. He's not going nowhere. I don't have to do anything. All I have to do in shoot a text and say, "Bring me Chick-fil-A." And that's it. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's a Oh. Oh, don't worry. Don't worry. You will understand me later. I'm somewhere ahead of you. You will understand me later. If you begin to do that, you will see. Even if he say now there's traffic on the road, before you know it, Chick-fil-A the re what what is pushing Chick-fil-A? It's not you. Your marriage already changed. That man have you in his mind. God have you in his mind. &gt;&gt; God is thinking about you. God is watching over you. God is caring for you. God is with you. Everywhere you going, it is God. Don't suffer like a woman that doesn't have a head &gt;&gt; because we got our head. A head that will never divorce you. &gt;&gt; It is God. You married eternally with him. &gt;&gt; Take that to a spiritual level. You will see exactly what God is trying to say. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's not there somebody who's holding things for you and let you suffer and he see suffer. A normal man will not even do that. And God say if we who are bad &gt;&gt; evil we know how to good give good give to our children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the way we behaving we make God look even bad. &gt;&gt; Like a man who's making his people suffering. No the problem is us. Understand the shift in the ministry. You've been in this message for so long. God has already been shifting in your life. It is up to you to catch up to the shift and behave accordingly. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we are approaching you humbly tonight. Father, thanking you for your grace, your love, your mercy, and for speaking to us tonight. Father, I pray that you bring a special revelation so that each one of us both invisible and visible audience can realize who we are in your eyes &gt;&gt; and the way you are looking in us. And once that revelation struck our heart, We won't even have a trouble asking you something and we would never look at our trial and our difficulties the same way. Father, you are shifting ministry. The hour is late. You changing ministry all over the world. We can see what is happening all over the broad. There is a new surge of energy that have come and it's pushing the word with such a powerful anointing all over the world because the ministry have changed. The time have changed. The people need a real and a true God. A living God that can walk in the midst of them that can do things for them. That can deliver them that can be a reality to their life. So that that will boost the for a a a I mean a faith in a higher level until rapturing faith will be so simple to grasp and to understand that for truth we will change and we will be transformed. If God can make it cancer disappear I'm no longer will doubt of a body change. Father, I pray that you give that revelation and open up the eyes like you did for Ghazi. For those that have still blindness in their eyes, may their eyes be completely open so that we can see where we are and at which stage we are in the ministry. Father, may you strengthen your man's servant that you use tonight. Bless us and give us mercy. Lord, we are committing the weekend unto the hand. Lord remove any evil and bad weather away from us. Protect us and protect your children father in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. I'll say yes. I'll say yes. Yes. I'll say yes, Lord. I'll say yes, Lord. I'll say yes. &gt;&gt; I'll say I'll say yes. Yes. I'll say yes. Yes. I'll say yes Lord. I'll say yes Lord. I'll say yes. Yes. Lord, I'll say yes, Lord. I'll say yes, Lord. I'll say yes, Lord. I'll say yes. &gt;&gt; I'll say I'll sing. Yes. I'll say yes. I'll say yes, Lord. I'll say yes, Lord. I'll say yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; One more time. I'll say yes. I'll say yes. Yes. I'll say yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I'll say yes, Lord. I'll say yes, Lord. I'll say yes. &gt;&gt; I'll say yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'll say yes, Lord. I'll say yes, Lord. I'll say yes. One last time. Oh, I'll say yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'll say yes, Lord. I'll say yes, Lord. Lord, I'll say yes. Yes. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat.
