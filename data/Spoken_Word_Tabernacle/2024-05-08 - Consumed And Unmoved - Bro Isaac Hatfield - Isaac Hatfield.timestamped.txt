[25:20] in the basement there was water sipping
[25:24] through the tiles into the room and we
[25:27] had sent you um a video to see how they
[25:30] were scooping literally scooping water
[25:33] with buckets and pouring outside because
[25:36] it was just you know coming into the
[25:38] room um so we were hoping that maybe if
[25:42] there was time you could see the
[25:43] difference um so anyway when we received
[25:46] that it was night time over there it was
[25:48] daytime over here was around 100 p.m.
[25:52] and when I read the message for some
[25:54] reason the Lord just held my heart I
[25:56] wasn't I didn't fry or anything my
[25:59] husband was at work and I was also at
[26:01] work and I just standed and I prayed I
[26:04] said Lord you've done this before you
[26:07] can do it again just dry up the water
[26:11] don't dry the B holes but just dry up
[26:13] the water that is sipping through and I
[26:15] let it I let it be I didn't do anything
[26:18] I didn't even call my husband and so
[26:20] when we arrived home from work we talked
[26:23] about it I said I just prayed and he
[26:25] said he also prayed and I told him I
[26:27] said I believe that what will be dry by
[26:29] tomorrow and we just let it be like that
[26:32] so in the morning uh when I woke up it
[26:35] was already midday over there uh I
[26:38] called my sister um no I actually called
[26:42] the lady that helps her and I asked
[26:44] about the water he said oh it stopped
[26:47] and I asked her what time did it stop
[26:49] and she said oh it just stopped at night
[26:52] and I and and I of course you know I
[26:54] thanked God and I said send me a video
[26:57] and so she sent me me a video in the

[59:18] Amen
[59:21] to Hebrews
[59:23] 12:25 to 29 says see that ye refuse not

[59:31] not who refused him that spake on Earth
[59:35] much more shall not we escape if we turn
[59:37] away from him that speaketh from Heaven
[59:40] whose voice then shook the Earth but now
[59:43] he hath promised saying yet once more I
[59:46] shake not the Earth only but also heaven
[59:49] and this word yet once more signifieth
[59:52] the removing of those things that are
[59:54] shaken that's right as of things that
[59:56] are made that those things which cannot
[59:58] be shaken may may remain therefore we
[1:00:02] receiving a kingdom which cannot be
[1:00:03] moved let us have Grace where whereby we
[1:00:06] may serve God acceptably with reverence
[1:00:09] and godly fear for our God is a
[1:00:12] consuming
[1:00:13] fire amen and one more text out of the
[1:00:16] Book of Matthew 17 sorry to keep you
[1:00:19] standing and uh how many loves the
[1:00:23] Lord amen
[1:00:26] Matthew
[1:00:28] 17 it says in the first eight verses
[1:00:32] here and after six days Jesus taketh
[1:00:36] Peter James and John his brother and
[1:00:38] bringeth them up into an high mountain
[1:00:40] apart and was transfigured before them
[1:00:43] and his face did shine as the sun and
[1:00:46] his reignment was white as the light and
[1:00:48] behold there appeared onto them Moses
[1:00:50] and Elias talking with him then answered
[1:00:54] Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is
[1:00:56] good for us to be here if thou Wilt let
[1:00:59] us make here three Tabernacles one for
[1:01:01] the one for thee one for Moses and one
[1:01:03] for Elias but while he yet spake Behold
[1:01:06] a bright Cloud overshadowed them and
[1:01:08] behold a voice out of the cloud which
[1:01:10] said this is my beloved Son in whom I am
[1:01:12] well pleased hear ye him and when the
[1:01:15] disciples heard it they fell on their
[1:01:17] face and were sore afraid and Jesus came
[1:01:20] and touched them and said arise and be
[1:01:22] not afraid and when they had lifted up
[1:01:24] their eyes they saw no man Sav Jesus
[1:01:27] only am amen if we could bow our

[1:01:40] brother Brandon taught us how when
[1:01:42] sometimes a Christian's going through

[1:01:47] visitation and so whatever trial you've
[1:01:50] been going through maybe not just to get

[1:03:07] to take a a thought out of that for a
[1:03:09] few moments on consumed and
[1:03:12] unmoved amen we want to be consumed and
[1:03:15] that it would make us unmovable and amen
[1:03:18] and brother Brandon preaches the message
[1:03:20] hear ye him many times and he he begins
[1:03:23] to express to us that it's a type of the
[1:03:25] coming of the Lord Lord and and he says
[1:03:27] here that he takes his disciples up into
[1:03:29] the mountain to see the order of his
[1:03:31] coming and there stood Moses Elijah and
[1:03:34] Jesus and he said Moses represented the
[1:03:37] dead Saints and Elijah represented the
[1:03:39] living Saints and and then there stood
[1:03:41] Jesus glorified and and if you go back
[1:03:44] one verse to the previous chapter in
[1:03:47] Matthew 16:28 it says verily I say un
[1:03:49] you there be some standing here which
[1:03:52] shall not taste of death till they see
[1:03:54] the son of man come coming in his
[1:03:56] kingdom and and brother Brandon would
[1:03:58] explain to us that that is what the Lord
[1:04:00] was doing he says it wasn't that the
[1:04:02] apostles were going to live to see his
[1:04:04] coming in its fullness because he didn't
[1:04:06] say all of you standing here he said
[1:04:08] there be some standing here and the some
[1:04:11] standing there would be Peter James and
[1:04:13] John that he was fixing to take up onto
[1:04:16] this mountain and show him a picture of
[1:04:18] his coming and and there they would see
[1:04:20] him and clothed in the cloud and his
[1:04:23] face shining like the sun and and and
[1:04:25] what what a wonderful thing it was for
[1:04:27] them to see that and I I brother Brandon
[1:04:30] would say how the Bible ties together
[1:04:33] how you can take scriptures and out of
[1:04:35] one scripture you could preach healing
[1:04:37] you could preach uh Deliverance you
[1:04:39] could because it all ties together and
[1:04:42] so here he was showing that it's a type
[1:04:44] of the coming of the Lord he said it's
[1:04:46] also would begin to show that it's a
[1:04:48] type of adoption and he said I'm going
[1:04:51] to take it in a little different sphere
[1:04:53] and he began to show that there they
[1:04:55] were up on a holy mountain and he said
[1:04:57] it wasn't so much that the mountain was
[1:04:59] holy but that there was a holy God up on
[1:05:01] the mountain and there stood Peter James
[1:05:04] and John and and Peter called it a Holy
[1:05:06] Mountain but there was Jesus and and
[1:05:09] Jesus there he was as the Son of God and
[1:05:12] he wasn't about to become a son he was
[1:05:14] already the son but God was fixing to
[1:05:16] adopt him for he had been obedient he
[1:05:18] hadn't just been ging about about all
[1:05:21] kinds of other business but he had been
[1:05:22] about the father's business he had been
[1:05:25] obedient here here he was bringing him
[1:05:27] up onto this mountain to to adopt him as
[1:05:29] the Son of God and there stood three
[1:05:32] Earthly Witnesses Peter James and John
[1:05:35] which represent faith hope and
[1:05:37] charity and three Heavenly Witnesses
[1:05:40] Moses Elijah and Jesus which represent
[1:05:43] the law the justice and the mercy and
[1:05:46] here stood Peter as Moses and Elijah
[1:05:49] begin to appear and and as as the face
[1:05:52] of Jesus begin to shine as like the sun
[1:05:55] there stood Peter and he got excited at
[1:05:57] the
[1:05:58] Supernatural and reasonably so I mean
[1:06:01] can you imagine seeing that with your
[1:06:02] own eyes it was a powerful moment but
[1:06:04] Peter got excited and said Lord I would
[1:06:07] that we could build three Tabernacles
[1:06:09] one for you one for Moses and one for
[1:06:12] Elijah but but the problem was that
[1:06:15] Moses represented the law and the law
[1:06:18] was a policeman the law could only
[1:06:20] condemn you the law could only put you
[1:06:22] in jail it had no Redeeming Grace
[1:06:25] because Grace came through Jesus Christ
[1:06:27] but but but but the law was only one
[1:06:30] that could condemn you and and the law
[1:06:32] had its place because brother Brandon
[1:06:34] would use out of Deuteronomy 4 I believe
[1:06:36] in the message the world falling apart
[1:06:38] and and there was a time where the Lord
[1:06:40] spoke on Mount Si there was a time where
[1:06:43] he gave forth the Ten Commandments there
[1:06:45] was the time where the law had a place
[1:06:47] but but here there's becoming to be a
[1:06:50] transition and showing that the law
[1:06:52] would have a shadow of good things to
[1:06:54] come he was coming one on the scene a
[1:06:58] priest after the order of MDC not made
[1:07:01] after the law of carinal Commandments
[1:07:03] but after the power of an endless life
[1:07:05] and here he would come on the scene and
[1:07:07] here Jesus would say it is said of Old
[1:07:09] Times Thou shalt not kill but he said I
[1:07:12] say unto you that whosoever is angry
[1:07:14] with his brother without a cause has
[1:07:15] already killed and thou shalt not commit
[1:07:18] adultery but whosoever lookth upon a
[1:07:20] woman and he wasn't changing the law for
[1:07:23] God doesn't change his word but he was
[1:07:24] magnifying
[1:07:26] here was the greater one coming into
[1:07:28] their midst and he represented Moses
[1:07:31] represented the law and brother Brandon
[1:07:32] would say that Elijah represents God's
[1:07:34] justice and brother say I don't want
[1:07:37] God's justice I want God's mercy and one
[1:07:40] time Elijah was up on a hill under a
[1:07:42] commission and the King wanted him to
[1:07:44] come down off the hill so he would send
[1:07:46] armies of 50 to come and get him off the
[1:07:49] hill but Elijah wasn't ready to come
[1:07:51] down off the hill at the command of the
[1:07:53] king but he said if I be a man of God
[1:07:55] fire fall from Heaven and consumed them
[1:07:58] and fire fell and consumed the army of
[1:08:01] 50 and the King thought well maybe it
[1:08:03] was just a lightning storm and so he
[1:08:05] sent another Army of 50 and fire he said
[1:08:08] if I be a man of God let fire fall and
[1:08:10] fire would fall and consume armies of 50
[1:08:13] until the king got tired of sending 50s
[1:08:16] brother Bron would say and that was
[1:08:18] God's justice that would that would that
[1:08:20] would consume armies of the enemy
[1:08:24] through his Justice and and and and
[1:08:26] Peter was about to say let's build three
[1:08:28] Tabernacles but thank the Lord before he
[1:08:30] could ever get those words out he was
[1:08:32] interrupted by a voice that said this is
[1:08:34] my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased
[1:08:38] hear ye him and when they looked up
[1:08:41] Moses was no longer standing there and
[1:08:43] Elijah was no longer standing there but
[1:08:45] they looked up and they saw Jesus only
[1:08:48] they saw God's love and God's mercy
[1:08:51] expressed to Mankind and that's the
[1:08:54] problem so many times with individuals
[1:08:56] is that they get their eyesight wrong
[1:08:59] and they never get their eyes off of the
[1:09:00] law and they never get their eyes off of
[1:09:02] the justice and even around this message
[1:09:05] you see people fall away because they
[1:09:07] never saw the reality of the message
[1:09:09] they never saw Christ in this message
[1:09:12] all they saw was a bunch of dos and
[1:09:13] don'ts and a bunch of dress codes and a
[1:09:16] bunch of religion and a bunch of of Acts
[1:09:19] and carnal Commandments but if you ever
[1:09:21] get your eyes pass the law and the
[1:09:24] justice have their place but if that's
[1:09:27] all that you ever see you'll live a
[1:09:29] you'll live
[1:09:30] a brother Brandon say a person that
[1:09:32] lives as a Halfway Christian is the most
[1:09:34] miserable person that there is because
[1:09:36] they're just living under the law and
[1:09:39] may be afraid of God's justice that
[1:09:41] might come upon them but if you ever get
[1:09:43] past that and see Jesus it'll bring a
[1:09:46] reality into your life you'll no longer
[1:09:48] just serve the Lord out of a out of a do
[1:09:50] or out of a religious act but it'll be a
[1:09:53] love that comes into your heart that'll
[1:09:55] make you dress right that'll make you
[1:09:57] live right that'll make you act right oh
[1:09:59] you won't have a self-righteous IND you
[1:10:02] won't have a a holier than thou attitude
[1:10:05] it'll put a humility in your heart you
[1:10:07] won't lift yourself up but it'll humble
[1:10:09] you to live the word for your hour and
[1:10:12] for your day amen oh but you got to get
[1:10:15] your eyes on the right thing and see
[1:10:18] Jesus uh some people maybe brother BR
[1:10:21] talk about how how there was an eagle in
[1:10:24] the chicken yard and some people may
[1:10:25] hear it and they think brother bram's
[1:10:27] calling him a chicken that's all that
[1:10:29] they can see but when you hear the word
[1:10:31] you hear it differently brother was
[1:10:33] calling me an eagle because I've heard
[1:10:36] another voice hear ye him the voice of
[1:10:39] the Lord that has called you out of your
[1:10:41] conditions and called you into a love
[1:10:43] relationship with him oh it's a powerful
[1:10:46] thing to hear the voice of the Lord amen
[1:10:50] and that's what you got to see and
[1:10:52] that'll bring a liberty to your life
[1:10:54] because it's it's it's not a bunch of
[1:10:56] legalism the legalistic dispensation
[1:10:59] ended when Jesus Christ came and bore
[1:11:02] our sins on the cross and he brought us
[1:11:04] into a Grace and he brought us into the
[1:11:06] unfailing promises of God and salvation
[1:11:10] is not Jesus plus your works and if
[1:11:13] that's the way you see it and sometimes
[1:11:15] it's easy to see it that way sometimes
[1:11:18] there's a voice in your
[1:11:19] head that that you feel like you haven't
[1:11:22] done enough you feel like you haven't
[1:11:23] done enough to earn it feel like you
[1:11:25] haven't uh maybe read your Bible enough
[1:11:28] that week and if God is in you he will
[1:11:30] live right The Works will follow but
[1:11:33] that is not what your salvation is
[1:11:35] depending on your salvation is depending
[1:11:37] on the blood of Jesus Christ that was
[1:11:40] shed on Calvary he shed a blood for your
[1:11:43] healing he shed a blood for your
[1:11:45] salvation amen if you could ever get a
[1:11:47] hold of the power of that blood that you
[1:11:50] are saved you are saved beyond the
[1:11:53] shadow of a doubt oh and say can't do
[1:11:55] anything to destroy that oh because it's
[1:11:58] a blood oh it's not the blood plus your
[1:12:01] conduct conduct it is Jesus only only
[1:12:05] the blood of Jesus amen that's the kind
[1:12:09] of Jesus only I believe in only the
[1:12:12] blood only the power of God my brother
[1:12:16] oh brother random say I would hate to
[1:12:17] try to go to heaven on my preaching or
[1:12:20] on my Visions but I'm going to heaven
[1:12:23] because I hold his grace my heart oh
[1:12:27] that's what you got to come to and
[1:12:29] that'll bring a liberty to your life
[1:12:31] brother oh but but but once that love is
[1:12:33] in your heart sir oh The Works will
[1:12:36] follow and that's what God's election is
[1:12:39] for a real believer election isn't just
[1:12:42] uh that you let go and you don't worry
[1:12:44] about anything because I'm elected and
[1:12:45] I'm going to make it anyway so I don't
[1:12:47] even have to try but I believe a True
[1:12:49] Believer that's been elected will try
[1:12:51] with everything that's in him to please
[1:12:53] the Lord and do right because God's love
[1:12:56] has been projected on your life and
[1:12:58] chose you before the foundation of the
[1:13:00] world and it's in you to want to please
[1:13:02] them amen oh but when you fall and make
[1:13:05] a mistake there's a trust and a blood to
[1:13:08] get back up yes my brother amen take
[1:13:11] there was a woman in adultery one time
[1:13:13] that's right and and they caught her in
[1:13:15] the very act and and they come to Jesus
[1:13:17] and said Moses in the law commanded us
[1:13:19] that she should be stoned but what
[1:13:21] sayest thou and he began to ride in the
[1:13:24] sand and say he that is without sin cast
[1:13:27] the first stone and Jesus was left alone
[1:13:30] after all those men were convicted and
[1:13:32] walked off Jesus was left alone with the
[1:13:36] woman and and when Jesus had lifted up
[1:13:39] himself John wrote and saw none but the
[1:13:41] woman he said unto her woman where are
[1:13:44] those thine accusers hath no man
[1:13:46] condemned thee that's it mean in the
[1:13:48] presence of Jesus the law had passed
[1:13:50] away the Justice had passed away her
[1:13:54] accusers had gone and there was a man
[1:13:57] whose blood was worthy to loose her of
[1:14:01] her condition yes my brother yes oh hear
[1:14:04] ye him brother Brandon would say it's a
[1:14:06] small text but it's a powerful text it
[1:14:10] brother Brandon said in obedience to
[1:14:11] those three words tonight you'll see a
[1:14:13] repeat of Pentecost in this building he
[1:14:16] said it's just small but there's enough
[1:14:18] power in there that the rest of the
[1:14:21] Bible would connect to it that's right
[1:14:23] why would you hear him because if you're
[1:14:25] sick tonight he's the only one that can
[1:14:27] heal if you're bound tonight if you're
[1:14:30] lost he's the only one that can save
[1:14:33] that's why you would hear him because
[1:14:34] he's the only one it's a word of
[1:14:37] Salvation to everyone who will believe
[1:14:39] that no matter what's the situation
[1:14:41] you're going through that there is a
[1:14:43] word a promise over your life and it's
[1:14:46] the authoritative word there's a lot of
[1:14:48] voices there's a lot of isms there's a
[1:14:51] lot of Creeds but we have a word of
[1:14:53] authority we have the final say over the
[1:14:57] situation and it's the word of the Lord
[1:15:00] It's the final say it's the
[1:15:02] authoritative word amen but brother
[1:15:05] Brandon would teach us that that there
[1:15:07] was a boy one time who had gotten some
[1:15:09] trouble and that he needed a part un
[1:15:11] lest he would die but but he would show
[1:15:14] us that that Abraham Lincoln could even
[1:15:17] write a note on a piece of paper and
[1:15:19] send it to that boy but the boy didn't
[1:15:22] accept it because it wasn't on fancy
[1:15:24] letterhead he didn't think it could be
[1:15:26] true and so he refused the know of his
[1:15:29] pardon and so they decided that a pardon
[1:15:32] is only a pardon if received as a pardon
[1:15:36] and brother BR said hear ye him it's a
[1:15:38] challenge it's a command it's a pardon
[1:15:41] it's all that you have need of if you'll
[1:15:43] accept it in that way but if you do not
[1:15:45] accept it that way it's just another
[1:15:48] piece of paper yes sir and so we read it
[1:15:50] in Hebrews see that she refuse not in
[1:15:53] that speaketh it's a pardon his voice is
[1:15:57] a pardon his voice is healing his voice
[1:16:00] is Deliverance but you must accept it in
[1:16:02] your heart and hide that word in your
[1:16:05] heart and hold on to it oh that it would
[1:16:08] be a pardon to you personally amen for
[1:16:11] it is a pardon and you can accept it in
[1:16:14] Mercy but God never sends judgment until
[1:16:16] he first sends his Mercy that's right
[1:16:19] and after his Mercy brother said it's
[1:16:21] bound to be judgment and so it it it
[1:16:24] would pay pay us to take heed to the
[1:16:27] voice of the Lord yes sir the voice of
[1:16:29] authority yes my brother see one time
[1:16:31] there was a boy who had committed a
[1:16:33] crime and he was in jail and he was
[1:16:35] going to be punished under capital
[1:16:37] punishment and taken and hung but the
[1:16:40] mother had such compassion on her child
[1:16:44] that she went before the governor and
[1:16:46] she crawled in on her hands and feet and
[1:16:49] plad for the life of her son so the
[1:16:51] governor said okay well I'll see what I
[1:16:54] can do and so he went and talked to the
[1:16:56] boy and the boy wouldn't even
[1:16:57] acknowledge Him the boy sat there in the
[1:16:59] jail said can't you see that I'm nervous
[1:17:02] and he wouldn't even acknowledge the
[1:17:03] governor the governor would say I'm
[1:17:05] trying to tell you and the boy would say
[1:17:07] no I I'm going to die can't you see that
[1:17:10] that I'm nervous and so the governor
[1:17:11] said well he made his choice and the
[1:17:14] governor had to walk out of that cell
[1:17:16] and the boy had to go and hang on The
[1:17:18] Gallows because he wouldn't take heed to
[1:17:21] the voice it's a voice of authority
[1:17:24] that's right in the Book of John Jesus
[1:17:27] was preaching and he was speaking to the
[1:17:29] people how he was the door how he was
[1:17:32] the Good Shepherd he said I have power
[1:17:34] to lay my life down and I have power to
[1:17:37] take it up again and then a few verses
[1:17:40] later the Bible says in the Book of John
[1:17:42] 10 that there was a division therefore
[1:17:45] again among the Jews for these thingss
[1:17:48] and many of them said he hath a devil
[1:17:51] and is mad why hear ye him said these
[1:17:55] are not the words of him that hath a
[1:17:57] devil can a devil Open the Eyes of the
[1:17:59] blind you see there was Jesus speaking
[1:18:02] to the people and there was a division
[1:18:05] amongst the people some said why hear ye
[1:18:07] him and some said how could a man do
[1:18:10] this in his own ability and and how
[1:18:12] could a man Open the Eyes of the blind
[1:18:15] these are not the words of him that hath
[1:18:16] a devil could a devil Open the Eyes of
[1:18:19] the Blind and there was a division on
[1:18:21] the authority of the words of Jesus
[1:18:23] Christ God in his grace and mercy has
[1:18:27] sent a message to us in this hour and he
[1:18:30] came like a mighty Angel clothed in a
[1:18:32] white wig which represented supreme
[1:18:35] authority and he gave us a message
[1:18:37] through the voice of the seventh angel
[1:18:39] and yet the devil still works amongst
[1:18:41] people today saying why should we hear
[1:18:44] him he's a man that has Devils he's be
[1:18:47] above he speaks hard things and they
[1:18:49] turn down the message their very pardon
[1:18:52] their very word of authority That Could
[1:18:55] set them free it's a voice of authority
[1:18:58] it was more than the voice of brother
[1:18:59] brandom it was the voice of the Lord
[1:19:01] speaking out in this generation but it's
[1:19:04] only a pardon if received as a pardon oh
[1:19:07] and there was a division amongst the
[1:19:09] people but you got to come to the place
[1:19:11] where you decide who which day choose ye
[1:19:14] this day who you will serve and what
[1:19:16] side of the division will you be on this
[1:19:18] message is not the voice of just a man
[1:19:21] this message is not the opinion of a man
[1:19:23] brother brandom this message came from
[1:19:25] God this message was sent from heaven
[1:19:28] and it's for me and I will not cast my
[1:19:30] lot with the accusers but I will say how
[1:19:33] could a man with a devil bring such a
[1:19:35] word as this but this message is my
[1:19:37] pardon this message is my Liberty this
[1:19:40] message has set me free because I
[1:19:43] received it in my heart oh that's the
[1:19:45] side I'm on I'm on the side of the
[1:19:47] critic I'm on the side that was seen
[1:19:50] beyond the curtain of time saying I'm
[1:19:52] resting on it it's nothing but the truth
[1:19:55] because you preached what Paul preached
[1:19:57] sir oh God's had many servants
[1:19:59] throughout the ages God's had an Oral
[1:20:02] Roberts God's had a Billy Graham and I
[1:20:04] thank the Lord for them they have their
[1:20:06] place but that was not the messenger he
[1:20:08] sent to me he sent to me the seventh
[1:20:11] angel to set me free from my condition
[1:20:14] and loose me and pardon my life and
[1:20:17] splash his blood across me that I could
[1:20:20] be free to Worship the Lord that I could
[1:20:23] be free to go in the rapture that I
[1:20:25] could be free to live an overcoming life
[1:20:27] and I receive it as a word of authority
[1:20:31] oh it was more than an opinion oh I
[1:20:34] wouldn't want to stand Before the Throne
[1:20:35] of God of judgment saying that this was
[1:20:38] just an opinion it was not an opinion it
[1:20:41] was the voice of the Lord what other
[1:20:43] Ministry had a voice come behind it and
[1:20:45] say I am just using Brother brandom's
[1:20:48] voice this is not him who was it
[1:20:50] standing on the river that day who was
[1:20:53] it that commissioned this message
[1:20:55] oh this is not the words of a Kentucky
[1:20:57] hillbilly this is the word of the Lord
[1:21:00] oh and it has power to deliver it has
[1:21:03] power to loose you it has power to set
[1:21:05] you free oh don't reject it oh brother
[1:21:09] Brandon would sing the song what then
[1:21:11] what then for those that have rejected
[1:21:13] the message for those that have rejected
[1:21:16] the Savior what then oh if you spurn
[1:21:19] Mercy judgment is coming but if you
[1:21:21] receive it if you receive this message
[1:21:24] the power of a word sent from the Lord
[1:21:28] oh it has power to Pardon yes sir it has
[1:21:30] power to heal yes sir oh my glory to God
[1:21:34] I know brother Brandon was a man and you
[1:21:36] don't have to drive the same truck he
[1:21:38] did you don't have to wear the same
[1:21:39] brand of clothes he did but when it
[1:21:41] comes to the word that was influenced by
[1:21:44] the angel of the Lord it would pay us to
[1:21:47] take heed for if they would not survive
[1:21:50] who refus the voice that spake from
[1:21:51] Earth how much more would you survive to
[1:21:54] refuse the voice that spoke from Heaven
[1:21:57] oh it's a Heavenly voice oh it would pay
[1:22:01] us to hear it that we might go free I
[1:22:05] know what side I'm onall I'm not
[1:22:07] confused about what voice has been sent
[1:22:10] to me oh it's been laid out in the
[1:22:13] scripture and so we're not here to lift
[1:22:16] up the problems we're not here to lift
[1:22:19] up the situations God's already sent a
[1:22:21] voice there's already a word yes all we
[1:22:24] got to do is hear it and lift it up
[1:22:27] above every situation lift it up above
[1:22:29] every problem brother Brandon said he's
[1:22:32] the one that can save you he's the one
[1:22:34] that can heal you he's the one that
[1:22:36] responsible for this he's the one
[1:22:38] responsible to his word and if I be
[1:22:40] lifted up I'll draw all men unto me oh
[1:22:44] I'm not responsible to fulfill it I'm
[1:22:47] just responsible to preach it you're not
[1:22:49] responsible to fulfill it you're just
[1:22:51] responsible to believe it you're
[1:22:53] responsible amen it and if I be lifted
[1:22:56] up amen we're here to lift up Jesus
[1:22:59] Christ he's the mighty one amongst us
[1:23:02] he's the great one amongst us he's the
[1:23:04] one that spoke it and the god that spoke
[1:23:07] it is the god that will perform it oh
[1:23:10] it's not by might it's not by power but
[1:23:12] it's by my spirit sayeth the Lord the
[1:23:15] one that spoke the promise he's the one
[1:23:17] that will perform it just take heed to
[1:23:20] the word hide it in your heart oh if you
[1:23:23] have need of healing tonight take heed
[1:23:25] to the voice of the Lord he spoke it
[1:23:28] he'll perform it he said you could have
[1:23:30] the Holy Ghost he'll give it just start
[1:23:33] thanking him for it just start praising
[1:23:35] him for it just start claiming your
[1:23:37] children in the presence of the Lord in
[1:23:40] the presence of the one that spoke it oh
[1:23:43] what are you doing brother Isaac I am
[1:23:44] lifting up the one that is able to take
[1:23:47] care of every problem that is able to
[1:23:49] take care of every situation oh it's the
[1:23:52] authoritative voice of the word of the
[1:23:53] Lord not a voice of yesterday but a
[1:23:56] present voice oh he's responsible
[1:24:01] because oh brother brandham taught us
[1:24:04] sir that a real Mount Transfiguration
[1:24:06] experience only glorifies Jesus Christ
[1:24:09] it didn't glorify Moses it didn't
[1:24:11] glorify Elijah it didn't glorify
[1:24:14] themselves it didn't glorify nothing
[1:24:16] else but Christ and so that's why we're
[1:24:19] here not to establish ourselves but to
[1:24:22] establish the word of God in the hearts
[1:24:25] of the people oh if I establish myself
[1:24:28] it may hold for a few seconds if that
[1:24:31] but eventually it'll fall but there is a
[1:24:33] kingdom which cannot be moved that we
[1:24:35] are Desiring to be established from the
[1:24:38] hearts of his people oh we are commanded
[1:24:42] Paul said I didn't come to you with
[1:24:43] enticing words of man that your Fai
[1:24:46] might Faith might rest up in the
[1:24:47] knowledge of man but I come to you in
[1:24:50] power and manifestation of the Holy
[1:24:52] Ghost that your faith might rest in God
[1:24:56] he said see they're trying to establish
[1:24:58] themselves every man I did this me I
[1:25:01] mine my denomination me this
[1:25:03] establishing themselves brother BR said
[1:25:05] what are we preaching about ourselves or
[1:25:08] the kingdom of God but we are meant to
[1:25:11] take the unbelief out and establish the
[1:25:13] word of God in the hearts of the people
[1:25:16] amen God has sent to us a message he
[1:25:19] wasn't showing them to join the Baptist
[1:25:21] he wasn't showing them to join the
[1:25:23] Methodist he was isn't showing them to
[1:25:25] join a certain church but to draw them
[1:25:27] onto him to draw them onto a body onto a
[1:25:31] kingdom unto a body of
[1:25:34] Believers amen that by one Spirit they
[1:25:37] could be baptized into one body and that
[1:25:40] Spirit of Truth would lead them into all
[1:25:43] truth oh to be about the father's
[1:25:46] business and the father's business is
[1:25:48] not just to to build churches or to
[1:25:51] establish kingdoms on this Earth but the
[1:25:54] father business is to vindicate the word
[1:25:56] to vindicate the words that have been
[1:25:58] spoken over our lives as his bride
[1:26:01] there's some words spoke over us and
[1:26:03] we're not here just to build a kingdom
[1:26:05] onto ourselves but we're here to work
[1:26:07] for the kingdom of God Amen we've got
[1:26:10] one objective wi Souls one motive love
[1:26:14] one objective mind the father keep the
[1:26:16] word one desire to see Jesus Christ
[1:26:19] glorified to lift up Jesus in the midst
[1:26:22] of the people brother amen that's our
[1:26:25] desire yes sir amen and and and because
[1:26:28] that's the kingdom we're born of that's
[1:26:30] exactly and if that's not your desire
[1:26:32] you check your heart and say Lord what
[1:26:35] kingdom am I really working for you see
[1:26:38] no matter how much you could make soup
[1:26:40] suppers you could bring all kinds of
[1:26:42] activities we see it in the world they
[1:26:45] they have to bring fog machines and all
[1:26:47] kinds of bands in that play music that's
[1:26:49] not even Christian at all and they have
[1:26:51] to bring in all sorts of attractions but
[1:26:54] the bride is attracted to the word and
[1:26:57] if you lift up the word and you preach
[1:26:59] it in power and demonstration it'll
[1:27:01] attract to people that are attracted to
[1:27:04] it the Deep calls to the deep and the
[1:27:07] word connects with the word and because
[1:27:09] the word is in you make fles you
[1:27:12] connected with this message oh it wasn't
[1:27:14] the color of the pews or the carpet it
[1:27:17] wasn't the bigness of the building or
[1:27:19] how much money it was but it was the
[1:27:22] reality of Jesus Christ that draw you
[1:27:25] onto this message oh it's another
[1:27:28] kingdom that we are associated with oh
[1:27:31] because the church does not come to life
[1:27:33] on Traditions but brother Rand said you
[1:27:35] might bring members by the millions but
[1:27:37] you'll never bring down the power of God
[1:27:39] until we get back to the original word
[1:27:41] again back to the foundational Faith
[1:27:45] back to the blood back to Jesus Christ
[1:27:48] back to oldfashioned prayer meetings and
[1:27:50] back to God brother oh that's why we
[1:27:52] don't believe in justy
[1:27:54] build
[1:27:55] numbers on carinal things because
[1:27:58] because we're not working for an
[1:28:00] organization we're working for the
[1:28:02] kingdom of God and our desire is to see
[1:28:05] individuals birst into that Kingdom amen
[1:28:07] whether they come to church here whether
[1:28:09] they come to church in Ohio whether they
[1:28:12] go to church in in Australia that
[1:28:14] doesn't matter to me just get birthed
[1:28:16] into a kingdom which cannot be moved
[1:28:19] because you could come here today and
[1:28:21] you could fall tomorrow if all your
[1:28:23] build on is is religion but if you ever
[1:28:25] get into Christ it'll hold you it'll
[1:28:28] hold you through every Church trouble
[1:28:30] it'll hold you through every trial and
[1:28:32] tribulation oh that's what we're working
[1:28:35] for amen we're not here to
[1:28:37] argue our Creeds our politics we're here
[1:28:41] to work for the kingdom of God brother
[1:28:44] amen oh but you don't have to put down
[1:28:47] your weapon entirely you just got to
[1:28:49] learn which kingdom to fight for for
[1:28:52] Paul said we wrestle not against flesh
[1:28:54] and blood but against principalities and
[1:28:56] Powers against the rulers of the
[1:28:58] darkness of this world against spiritual
[1:29:00] wickedness in high places yes sir Amen
[1:29:03] brother Brandon was preaching hear ye
[1:29:04] himm and he said you know the reason we
[1:29:07] can't run everybody it's not in an arena

[1:29:20] this Arena we want to make it the Church
[1:29:23] of God Amen brother brandom as a man of
[1:29:26] God can convert an arena into a church
[1:29:29] but the danger is that we never want to
[1:29:31] do is to convert the church into an
[1:29:33] arena and turn it fight for the wrong
[1:29:36] Kingdom and turn your sword on your
[1:29:38] brother or your sister and turn your
[1:29:40] weapon on your neighbor but we've
[1:29:42] wrestled not against flesh and blood but

[1:29:47] ahead but we're in a battle Satan is a
[1:29:50] liar and he's come to Rob your joy he's
[1:29:52] come to Rob your victory but I've got a
[1:29:55] sword tonight of the word of the Lord
[1:29:57] and we've come to hack away at every
[1:29:59] Spirit of condemnation every spirit of
[1:30:01] fear every Spirit of unbelief that will
[1:30:04] try to hold you in your cage of defeat
[1:30:06] and darkness oh that's not where you
[1:30:08] belong daughter of God you don't belong
[1:30:11] in a cage you belong in the heavenlies
[1:30:13] with the Eagles of almighty God oh so

[1:30:19] kingdom of God oh we've got a lot to
[1:30:22] fight for we got of needs sir oh but

[1:30:28] prayer we turn to the word and watch
[1:30:31] devil scatter as the people of God yes
[1:30:35] my brother oh it's no wonder the devil
[1:30:36] fights your prayer life it's a powerful
[1:30:39] weapon placed into the hand of Believers
[1:30:41] when the weakest Christian gets on their
[1:30:43] knees the devil trembles and so he tries
[1:30:46] to keep you from that prayer life
[1:30:48] because he knows it's effective but oh
[1:30:50] if we just if you fight through that and
[1:30:52] you press through that and you press
[1:30:54] through the the hindrance oh watch the
[1:30:57] visitation come watch the victory come

[1:31:12] need it oh it may look like the darkest
[1:31:14] hour but watch Jesus come on the scene
[1:31:17] and turn the situation around he's
[1:31:19] asleep in the boat sometimes but he
[1:31:21] hasn't left you he said I'll never leave

[1:31:26] boat but you might have to go down there
[1:31:28] and wake him up maybe you have to wake
[1:31:30] him up with your faith sometimes say

[1:32:01] Day Too Late oh he sees you toiling he
[1:32:05] sees you struggling he sees you in the
[1:32:07] middle of your battle oh but he knows
[1:32:11] and in that darkest hour then Jesus

[1:32:31] Lord yes my brother it cannot fail take
[1:32:33] your time oh Mount Transfiguration yes
[1:32:36] my it ended the struggle because God was
[1:32:39] establishing a kingdom a Vindicated word
[1:32:43] that it would no more just be the words
[1:32:44] of the law and the prophets but that
[1:32:46] which they had spoken of they had spoken
[1:32:48] of a messiah coming but now Messiah was
[1:32:51] here and he was he he he the word had
[1:32:54] come to light and he was the light of
[1:32:56] the hour and brother BR want say about
[1:32:59] it was going from partial realization to
[1:33:02] perfect realization here here the
[1:33:05] Israelites had Mana from heaven but here
[1:33:07] Jesus was the true bread from Heaven
[1:33:09] that's exactly they had had partial
[1:33:11] salvation under the blood of blls and
[1:33:14] goats but here was the whole of
[1:33:16] Salvation you know Israel had light in
[1:33:19] the days of Egypt but here was true
[1:33:21] light here was the Fulfillment of light
[1:33:24] Moses was a prophet Jesus was the
[1:33:27] prophet David was a king of Israel Jesus
[1:33:30] was the greater David am the king of
[1:33:33] kings yes sir yes my brother and Peter
[1:33:36] wrote about this Mount Transfiguration
[1:33:39] that's right and he said more ever I
[1:33:40] will endeavor yes sir that you may be
[1:33:43] able after my decease to have these
[1:33:44] things always in remembrance always for
[1:33:47] we have not followed cunningly devised
[1:33:49] fables when we made known unto you the
[1:33:52] power and coming of our Lord Jesus
[1:33:53] Christ but were eyewitnesses of his
[1:33:56] majesty for he received from God the
[1:33:59] Father honor and Glory when there came
[1:34:01] such a voice to him from the excellent
[1:34:03] Glory that's right this is my beloved
[1:34:05] Son in whom I am well pleased yes sir
[1:34:07] and this voice which came from heaven we
[1:34:09] heard when we were with him in the Holy
[1:34:11] Mount now here this we have also a more
[1:34:13] sure word of Prophecy that's it where
[1:34:16] onto you do well that you take heed so
[1:34:19] see that you refuse it not as onto a
[1:34:21] light that shineth in a dark place yes
[1:34:24] until the day Dawn and the day star rise
[1:34:26] in your hearts knowing this first that
[1:34:28] no that no Prophecy of the scriptures of
[1:34:31] any private interpretation that's exact
[1:34:34] there may have been a period of time
[1:34:36] where that men had come up with private
[1:34:38] interpretations of how the Messiah would
[1:34:40] come and maybe there was a period of
[1:34:42] time where they didn't know if that was
[1:34:44] the true interpretation or not because
[1:34:47] it hadn't come to pass yet but God God
[1:34:49] interprets his word by bringing it to
[1:34:51] pass and here come the true
[1:34:54] interpretation of the word into their
[1:34:56] midst and say they no longer had to
[1:34:57] wonder if the private interpretation was
[1:35:00] right they had a true interpretation in
[1:35:03] their midst they were walking in the
[1:35:05] light of the Vindicated word that day
[1:35:08] star that would shine upon their paths
[1:35:10] amen oh in a falling apart World God
[1:35:12] sent them a messiah yes my brother amen
[1:35:15] and we can walk in the light of the
[1:35:18] Vindicated word yes my brother glory to
[1:35:20] God and let it consume Our Lives yes sir
[1:35:23] see something's going to consume you
[1:35:25] amen you'll be consumed by something
[1:35:27] maybe certain hobes consume your lives
[1:35:31] or or certain habits consume your lives
[1:35:34] or even in the positive things can cons
[1:35:36] consume your time they may not always be
[1:35:39] bad but but you're constantly being
[1:35:41] consumed by one thing or another and
[1:35:44] something will have the first place in
[1:35:46] your life but thank God that that it was
[1:35:49] written in Hebrews that our God is a
[1:35:52] consuming fire amen See Fire is the most
[1:35:55] consuming thing that there is brother B
[1:35:58] said certainly we just need the fire he
[1:36:01] said let the fires go out in the church
[1:36:03] brother and the church is gone they said
[1:36:05] there was an old Baptist brother that
[1:36:07] got saved one time and they told him if
[1:36:09] he didn't quit quit preaching like that
[1:36:11] that he was going to kill his church and
[1:36:14] that brother got up and he said look
[1:36:15] here Elder he said any church that ever
[1:36:17] dies with the Holy Ghost fire in it he
[1:36:20] said I'll climb the old Vines out there
[1:36:22] to the top of this pinnacle and lay my
[1:36:24] hands and say blessed is the law the
[1:36:26] dead defying the law he said they don't
[1:36:29] die they just get alive they died the
[1:36:32] things of the world in order to come to
[1:36:34] life in Jesus Christ am amen because
[1:36:37] brother brandom one time he was with his
[1:36:39] brother and they went out and they found
[1:36:41] a turtle and that Turtle when they come
[1:36:44] up to it it tucked its head into it
[1:36:46] shell he they like those old mossback
[1:36:49] Christians sometimes and so they took
[1:36:51] the turtle and they took a stick and
[1:36:53] they tried to beat it to get its head to
[1:36:55] come out and it didn't work they took it
[1:36:57] and they tried to drown it in water and
[1:37:00] just a few bubbles come up but it it
[1:37:02] didn't do anything then they went and
[1:37:05] they lit a fire under that turtle and
[1:37:07] that caused that Turtle to move that put
[1:37:10] something under him to move and if you
[1:37:12] want to see a church move forward you
[1:37:14] don't beat them up with a bunch of Law
[1:37:16] and a bunch of legalism oh it's not that
[1:37:19] you baptize them Face Forward backward
[1:37:21] but let the fire of God Loos in the
[1:37:24] house of God that will do more than
[1:37:26] every stick that'll do more than every
[1:37:29] carnal commandment let the power of God
[1:37:32] loosen the church to set children of God
[1:37:35] free from the habits that have consumed
[1:37:37] them from the world that has consumed us
[1:37:40] but there is a fire of God that can
[1:37:42] consume greater than any devil could
[1:37:44] ever consume you greater than every
[1:37:47] habit could ever consume you but if you
[1:37:49] ever lay your life on the altar of God
[1:37:52] as a living sacrifice with a genuine
[1:37:55] heart there is a fire that is still in
[1:37:58] the midst of the church today that can
[1:38:00] fall down upon your life burn out the
[1:38:03] world and you can be consumed as a pig
[1:38:06] and bed as a lamb of God oh you won't
[1:38:10] love the world or the things of the
[1:38:11] world anymore I'm talking about an
[1:38:13] experience on the backside of the
[1:38:16] deserts you oh I'm not talking about a
[1:38:19] handshaking I'm not talking about
[1:38:21] putting your name on a book no sir
[1:38:23] talking about a reality I'm talking
[1:38:26] about a consuming fire oh it's the fire
[1:38:29] that led the children of Israel it's the
[1:38:31] fire that was had his picture taken with
[1:38:33] brother brandom it's the fire that was
[1:38:36] with Moses it was the fire that was in
[1:38:38] the Lion's Den with Daniel that fire
[1:38:41] hasn't left the church it can still
[1:38:43] consume your life it can burn out every
[1:38:45] habit every addiction every drug
[1:38:48] addiction every every religious
[1:38:51] addiction every unbelief
[1:38:54] oh there is a consuming fire that is
[1:38:56] able to burn out everything contrary to
[1:39:00] this word and birth you forth yes sir oh
[1:39:03] it's still God's Avenue you see in
[1:39:07] Genesis there was a fiery cherums
[1:39:09] guarding the tree of life and they had
[1:39:11] it come by the way of fire but there was
[1:39:14] a time when those cherums were keeping
[1:39:16] from entering into that Garden that's
[1:39:18] right but those choms are not keeping us
[1:39:20] from entering now now they're ushering
[1:39:22] us in but still brother brandom said the
[1:39:25] Holy Spirit fire guarding the gate he
[1:39:28] said and today that's what guards the
[1:39:30] gate if you're scared of Holy Ghost and
[1:39:33] Fire you'll never get in that's it fiery
[1:39:36] the sword of God God is a consuming fire
[1:39:39] watching that tree yes my brother glory
[1:39:43] to God it it's the power of God oh those
[1:39:46] lines wouldn't come to Daniel when that
[1:39:48] fire was there that's it cuz like
[1:39:50] brother Brandon sang that song it's the
[1:39:52] old time Holy Spirit and the devil won't
[1:39:55] go near it that's the reason people fear
[1:39:57] it but it's good enough for me and if it
[1:40:00] was good enough for brother brandom it's
[1:40:02] good enough for me yes sir oh God can do
[1:40:05] a work in your life amen amen it's a
[1:40:08] consuming fire and sometimes it's
[1:40:11] consuming in judgment yes sir you know
[1:40:14] in Genesis 19 was the first time fire
[1:40:17] was mentioned and it said then the Lord
[1:40:19] reigned upon Sodom and gomorra brimstone
[1:40:22] and fire that's right and Jude picked it
[1:40:24] up in Jude one and he's talking about
[1:40:27] the the Angels which kept not their
[1:40:29] first estate but left their habitation
[1:40:32] Heath reserved in Everlasting chains
[1:40:34] outer Darkness under the Judgment of the
[1:40:36] great day and then he says even as Sodom
[1:40:38] and gomor and the cities about them in
[1:40:41] like manner giving themselves over to
[1:40:43] fornication going after strange flesh or
[1:40:46] set forth for an example suffering the
[1:40:48] Vengeance of Eternal fire and brother
[1:40:51] Brandon picks up that Eternal fire and
[1:40:53] says to be completely consumed and done
[1:40:56] away with for for he would show us and
[1:40:59] someone would ask him a question and
[1:41:01] question and answers on Hebrews about
[1:41:04] how how if they do not burn eternally
[1:41:06] cuz we know he would taught us that it
[1:41:08] wasn't an eternal hell that's exactly
[1:41:10] but for a space of time he said then
[1:41:12] What Becomes of them and he's explaining
[1:41:15] this and and we're just showing the
[1:41:16] contrast here he said will it be just
[1:41:19] like regular Brimstone he said I believe
[1:41:21] it'll be a million times worse that I
[1:41:24] believe you couldn't describe it by fire
[1:41:26] by aital fire but the only reason it's
[1:41:28] put by fire that fire is the most
[1:41:31] consuming thing that we have exactly
[1:41:33] right and he said that it absolutely
[1:41:35] consumes and destroys everything sir
[1:41:38] fire does he said well then it'll be in
[1:41:41] there but you have a soul that'll have
[1:41:42] to be punished through some kind that's
[1:41:44] it and then he says now you have to
[1:41:47] watch the word fire because the Holy
[1:41:49] Ghost is used the Holy Ghost in fire
[1:41:52] amen because Holy Ghost Fire Burns Out
[1:41:55] sin and makes clean so you see there is
[1:41:59] a point in your life where you'll have
[1:42:00] to come in contact with fire and you'll
[1:42:04] either be saved by fire or destroyed by
[1:42:07] fire but here is showing us there is a
[1:42:09] contrast there is a judgment fire but
[1:42:12] there is a Holy Ghost Fire which just
[1:42:15] like God is going to cleanse this Earth
[1:42:18] with Holy Fire so that we might dwell in
[1:42:20] it in the future home and in in the in
[1:42:23] the eternities with him there is a holy
[1:42:26] ghost fire that cleans out the
[1:42:28] individual so that God might dwell in
[1:42:31] that individual it'll have to be more he
[1:42:33] he'll give you a new spirit he'll begin
[1:42:35] to change you but then he'll put his
[1:42:38] spirit in you but it's got to cleanse
[1:42:40] out the habits he got to cleanse out the
[1:42:42] the humanity and the carnal desires and
[1:42:46] put inside of you a transformation that
[1:42:49] his life might dwell in you amen just
[1:42:52] like Elijah on Mount Carmel that they he
[1:42:55] could say let the god that is God answer
[1:42:58] by Fire and Fire could fall and consume
[1:43:01] the sacrifice on the altar yes sir amen
[1:43:04] and there is a fire that can roll off
[1:43:07] the Altar and consume your life yes sir
[1:43:10] oh and it and I've got a a powerful
[1:43:14] something that encourages me is that if
[1:43:16] you're ever once saved by fire then you
[1:43:19] can't be destroyed by fire if the fire
[1:43:21] of God ever once consumes you then
[1:43:24] brother there's not enough devils in
[1:43:25] hell to destroy you there's not enough
[1:43:27] judgment to destroy you you can't burn
[1:43:30] it out of the of the people of God they
[1:43:33] couldn't burn it out of the Hebrew
[1:43:34] children and said the fire would have no
[1:43:37] power over their bodies and they didn't
[1:43:38] even smell like fire and that's a true
[1:43:41] believer that comes through the trials
[1:43:43] and the tribulations of life and Satan
[1:43:46] is shooting his fiery darts at you but
[1:43:48] fire cannot burn out fire they cannot
[1:43:51] burn it out of the Hebrew children
[1:43:53] and they cannot burn it out of the Sons
[1:43:55] and Daughters of God for the Holy Ghost
[1:43:58] is fire itself and Fire Can't burn fire
[1:44:01] and the fire couldn't boil fire when
[1:44:04] they tried to put John in a vat of oil
[1:44:06] they couldn't boil it out because there
[1:44:08] was something in John there was a
[1:44:10] keeping power there was a fire of the
[1:44:13] Holy Ghost that burned inside of them oh
[1:44:16] and it kept them through every trial
[1:44:18] amen and Satan cannot blow it out God
[1:44:21] has lit a fire in the church of the
[1:44:23] Living God that cannot be blown out by
[1:44:26] any Winds of opposition by any Winds of
[1:44:30] torment and any Winds of Trials there is
[1:44:32] not enough wind that the devil has to
[1:44:35] blow out the fire that's been lit in the
[1:44:38] life of a son and daughter of God
[1:44:40] because brother random showed us as the
[1:44:42] children of Israel followed that great
[1:44:45] Pillar of Fire he said there was a wind
[1:44:47] that followed and that wind opened up
[1:44:49] that Red Sea and he said when men walk
[1:44:52] in the light the winds follow and the
[1:44:55] winds that follow this light of God that
[1:44:58] we walk in those winds are greater than
[1:45:01] any Winds of doctrine that the devil has
[1:45:04] Winds of doctrine that have come in and
[1:45:06] destroyed homes Winds of doctrine that
[1:45:08] have destroyed lies Winds of doctrine
[1:45:10] that have destroyed churches oh come on
[1:45:13] you've maybe felt some of those winds
[1:45:15] and why are you still here because you
[1:45:17] are walking in the light of the
[1:45:18] Vindicated word you're walking in the
[1:45:21] light of the day star you're walking in
[1:45:23] the light of the message of the hour the
[1:45:25] evening light has come and as you walk
[1:45:28] in the light there is a mighty rushing
[1:45:30] wind that follows behind you and it's a
[1:45:33] greater wind than every wind of Doctrine
[1:45:35] than every wind of opposition oh it's
[1:45:38] the wind of God Amen oh you which have
[1:45:40] been saved by fire you will not be
[1:45:43] destroyed by fire yes my brother oh yes
[1:45:46] my brother there is no place in the L of
[1:45:49] fire for me there is no place in hell
[1:45:52] for for me that's it because I've been
[1:45:55] consumed by another fire and I'll just
[1:45:58] read this one for you brother brandom
[1:46:00] said a man who would say could believe
[1:46:03] that the church will go through a
[1:46:04] tribulation period he said I wonder
[1:46:06] where you'd ever get a siege for that
[1:46:08] and man this is a refrigerator quote
[1:46:10] when even will you say I believe it says
[1:46:12] this that the that's all right did you
[1:46:14] notice back there yonder where the rains
[1:46:15] fell in the other time where did it fall
[1:46:17] Noah was in the ark before judgment
[1:46:20] struck and he would say that Sodom l was
[1:46:23] out of Sodom before it taken place is
[1:46:25] that we ain't going through no
[1:46:26] tribulation period you're going in the
[1:46:28] Rapture one of these days certainly why
[1:46:30] do you have to be judged he stood my
[1:46:32] tribulation Jesus Christ that's where my
[1:46:35] tribulation taken place right there I
[1:46:37] accepted him and free when I see the
[1:46:39] blood I'll pass over you that's right
[1:46:42] Moses was safely protected from is with
[1:46:44] Israel while the tribulation fell what
[1:46:47] is it friends oh you can identify
[1:46:50] tribulation is either in your future
[1:46:53] it's in your past but tribulation is not
[1:46:55] in my future tribulation is in my past
[1:46:58] because Jesus Christ already bore my
[1:47:00] tribulation on Calvary and when I
[1:47:03] accepted that blood sacrifice and the
[1:47:05] fire of the Holy Ghost came back upon my
[1:47:08] life I've been set free my future is
[1:47:11] clear the future of this bride is clear
[1:47:14] tribulation is not in your future
[1:47:16] tribulation is in your past because you
[1:47:19] cannot be destroyed by judgment fire a
[1:47:23] fire will have no harm on those that
[1:47:26] have been born into the Heavenly Kingdom
[1:47:28] it's a kingdom which cannot be moved
[1:47:31] it's a kingdom that's going to last
[1:47:34] through all generations and ages oh it's
[1:47:37] a loosing power it's a consuming fire oh
[1:47:41] why because he that heareth my words and
[1:47:44] believeth on him that set me hath
[1:47:46] everlasting life and shall not come into
[1:47:49] condemnation but is passed from Death
[1:47:51] unto life he that heareth my words hear
[1:47:55] ye him and receive it as a voice of
[1:47:58] Pardon receive it as a voice of
[1:48:01] Deliverance oh you don't have to live in
[1:48:03] that battle of fear any longer he has
[1:48:05] not given you the spirit of fear but of
[1:48:08] power and of love and of a sound mind
[1:48:10] brother oh that devil of fear is no
[1:48:13] match to the consuming fire of almighty
[1:48:16] God and I pray that God's fire will come
[1:48:19] by your mind and cleanse it oh and wash
[1:48:22] of every
[1:48:24] fear every mind battle every complex
[1:48:27] every inferior complex that you're not
[1:48:30] good enough and nobody loves you oh let
[1:48:32] the fire of God consume you tonight
[1:48:36] Glory oh and take all your habits from
[1:48:38] glory to God hallelujah amen oh hear his
[1:48:43] voice it's the same fire that always was
[1:48:46] this is not a new fire this is the fire
[1:48:49] that God lit his sacred altar with this
[1:48:51] is the fire that dwelt in those
[1:48:54] candlesticks which John saw on the aisle
[1:48:57] of patmas this is the fire that the
[1:48:59] priest took and he lit the first candle
[1:49:02] and they took the first candle and they
[1:49:04] lit the second candle to the third to
[1:49:06] the fourth to the fifth to the sixth to
[1:49:09] the seventh oh and God had seven
[1:49:12] Messengers to tend the flame throughout
[1:49:15] Seven Ages oh you have not been consumed
[1:49:19] with a strange denominational fire fire
[1:49:22] that consumed your life it's the fire
[1:49:25] from the altar of God that has been
[1:49:27] poured out in this generation it's the
[1:49:29] message of the hour it's the flame of
[1:49:32] the hour and it's the flame that's in my
[1:49:35] heart oh it's not confusion it's a voice
[1:49:39] that has Set Me Free oh and this fire
[1:49:42] does not make Fanatics this fire takes
[1:49:45] Fanatics and it makes Saints out of them
[1:49:48] oh we are not scared of wildfire we are
[1:49:50] not scared of this fire it is the fire
[1:49:53] of God it is the fire from the Throne of
[1:49:56] God oh but God is going to need some
[1:49:59] people that'll keep that flame alive oh
[1:50:03] because they denominated in every age
[1:50:06] they denominated and that fire would go
[1:50:08] out and they would have to pass the
[1:50:10] torch light to the Next Generation but
[1:50:13] friends there's not another age coming
[1:50:15] there's not another church age coming
[1:50:17] but every True Believer your life the
[1:50:20] wick of your life has been dipped into
[1:50:22] that tame oil you've been put on fire by
[1:50:26] the fire of God you've got oil in your
[1:50:28] lamp it's been lit by God you are
[1:50:31] manifesting the word for your day and
[1:50:34] there is a bride who will not add to
[1:50:36] this word who will not take from this
[1:50:38] word and God has sent us a message that
[1:50:41] cannot be
[1:50:42] denominated oh brother say that usually
[1:50:46] after 3 years a message will go into
[1:50:48] organization and he would say this one's
[1:50:50] been going up for 20 years and it's
[1:50:52] still going and that was about 60 years
[1:50:55] ago so it's been about 80 years and the
[1:50:58] same fire that was there in brother
[1:50:59] brandom's day it is still burning in the
[1:51:02] hearts of his believing children oh
[1:51:04] don't let it go out take this word and
[1:51:07] hide it in your hearts oh we're not here
[1:51:09] to quench the fire we're not here to add
[1:51:12] to what the prophet said we're not here
[1:51:14] to take away from what the prophet said
[1:51:16] we're here to take the message of the
[1:51:18] hour and fan the Flames of the fire of
[1:51:21] God The Winds of the Holy Ghost would
[1:51:24] blow behind it and pick up our young
[1:51:26] people and fill them with the Holy Ghost
[1:51:29] and set free every captive oh it would
[1:51:32] pick up the elders that have been bound
[1:51:34] in religion and never got a reality but
[1:51:36] there is a holy ghost in the building
[1:51:38] tonight oh that you can be changed I'm
[1:51:41] talking about a change I'm talking about
[1:51:43] a reality you don't have to stay where
[1:51:45] you're at oh you may have struggled with
[1:51:47] that habit for years oh but let the Holy
[1:51:50] Ghost oh say Lord I'll be a Living
[1:51:53] Sacrifice oh burn it out of me Lord It's
[1:51:56] the fire of God it's the fire from the
[1:51:59] Throne of God oh it won't go out it
[1:52:02] can't go out it's God's purpose that
[1:52:05] this flame will burn under the coming of
[1:52:07] the lord it's a torch light of freedom
[1:52:11] and it's burning in my heart and it's
[1:52:13] burning in your heart yes my brother
[1:52:16] take your time I don't know about you I
[1:52:18] want to be a keeper of this flame take
[1:52:20] your time I I don't want to add to it I
[1:52:23] I want to keep it burning am oh by
[1:52:26] staying with the word of God God is
[1:52:29] establishing a kingdom that's on the
[1:52:32] wordu oh it's a kingdom which cannot be
[1:52:34] moved and that kingdom is Christ oh and
[1:52:37] anything will fall if it's not on the
[1:52:40] word of God but God has a kingdom
[1:52:43] Hallelujah you see when the king had
[1:52:46] lost his wife Ashy and and she had done
[1:52:49] what she did and she had fallen he was
[1:52:51] going to have to look for somebody else
[1:52:53] to establish his kingdom with and so he
[1:52:56] could look out across the kingdom and
[1:52:58] say who will it be and and one could
[1:53:00] maybe be a little prettier and one could
[1:53:02] maybe look a little nicer according to
[1:53:05] the world standards but there was an
[1:53:07] Esther in the land and Esther only
[1:53:10] required what Hagi appointed she didn't
[1:53:12] want anything more she didn't want
[1:53:14] anything less and whatever the tutor
[1:53:16] appointed she would just say be it onto
[1:53:19] me that's what I want I don't want
[1:53:21] anymore I don't want any less and when
[1:53:23] Hagi could go back to the king I could
[1:53:26] imagine that he would bring back a good
[1:53:27] report that Esther was following
[1:53:30] whatever he appointed whatever he
[1:53:32] desired that's what she would take and
[1:53:35] so when God would send a messenger into
[1:53:37] this age and he would look out across
[1:53:39] all the denominations and all the
[1:53:41] churches and he would see that that
[1:53:44] there was some that were very pretty and
[1:53:46] that very big buildings but they would
[1:53:48] not only require what Hagi appointed but
[1:53:51] there was a bride who only wanted what
[1:53:54] the message appointed who only wanted
[1:53:56] what the word said they said I don't
[1:53:58] want to add to it I don't want to take
[1:54:00] it away it's good enough for me and when
[1:54:03] Esther humbled herself to that word she
[1:54:05] found herself not dead in the presence
[1:54:08] of the king but exalted to ad join there
[1:54:11] and she requested that her and her
[1:54:14] family would be saved oh and there is a
[1:54:17] bride that is on the scene that only
[1:54:20] required what this elaser appointed
[1:54:23] she's been dressed in the garments of
[1:54:24] the word and she's been exalted to join
[1:54:27] HS she's been lifted up into a kingdom
[1:54:30] oh that cannot fall away and she's been
[1:54:32] trusted with ask what you will and it
[1:54:35] shall be given unto you oh as we draw to
[1:54:38] close oh let's catch this there was a
[1:54:40] Hatty ride and the first time that new
[1:54:43] ministry was ever used on an individual
[1:54:45] it was used on a little water woman it
[1:54:48] wasn't even in a church it was in a home
[1:54:51] but as her voice rang out out brother
[1:54:53] brand that's nothing but the truth there
[1:54:55] came a creative power that swept over
[1:54:57] brother Brandon and told her to ask what
[1:54:59] you will and it shall be given unto you
[1:55:02] and like Esther she had a desire for the
[1:55:04] Salvation of her family that they
[1:55:06] wouldn't be destroyed and so he spoke
[1:55:09] for her two sons and that she received
[1:55:12] what she asked for but why did God send
[1:55:15] it to her because he knew what she would
[1:55:18] ask he knew if she ever sent it to the
[1:55:20] aristocrats and those man they would ask
[1:55:23] things that would build a kingdom onto
[1:55:25] themselves they would ask things that
[1:55:27] weren't right but he sent it to a little
[1:55:29] humble widow woman who would ask
[1:55:31] something that would not exalt herself
[1:55:34] but would exalt the kingdom of God
[1:55:36] because this bride her desire is a true
[1:55:39] Mount Transfiguration experience to only
[1:55:42] glorify Jesus Christ and oh there there
[1:55:46] why did God trust you with this message
[1:55:48] why did he ever send this anointing upon
[1:55:50] your life because he knew you would do
[1:55:52] with it he knew that you wouldn't use it
[1:55:55] to build a kingdom onto yourself he knew
[1:55:57] that you wouldn't use it to exalt
[1:55:59] yourself but he said I can trust them
[1:56:01] with this message they'll only use it to
[1:56:03] live for me there'll be a join a
[1:56:05] there'll be a queen that I can reign
[1:56:07] with and Rule with for all eternity oh
[1:56:11] there's a prde that's been lifted up
[1:56:13] into a join a position that's been
[1:56:16] established with the father oh and he
[1:56:19] chose you according to his good pledge
[1:56:22] meure and we are not ashamed of this
[1:56:25] message like that young girl that stood
[1:56:28] on those train steps and looked at her
[1:56:31] mother burned in a fire and she was
[1:56:33] ashamed of her mother but you know the
[1:56:35] reason that this bride is so beautiful
[1:56:38] is because this word had to become ugly
[1:56:41] Jesus had to go he had to hang on a
[1:56:44] cross he had to bled he had to die he
[1:56:47] had to be whipped with stripes 39 till
[1:56:50] he was bleeding till
[1:56:53] he he he he was there in such Agony and
[1:56:56] such pain and there come a prophet who
[1:56:59] was rejected he was laughed at scorned
[1:57:02] and made fun of but this message took on
[1:57:05] that form so that I might be beautiful
[1:57:07] so that I might walk in a pure spotless
[1:57:10] garment and I am not ashamed of it I'm
[1:57:13] not ashamed of this voice I'm not
[1:57:15] ashamed to be identified with this
[1:57:18] message it's a kingdom that cannot fall
[1:57:21] apart
[1:57:23] amen as the musicians come in the
[1:57:26] prophecy of his
[1:57:27] coming Isaiah said the grass withth and
[1:57:31] the flower fadeth but the word of the
[1:57:33] God shall stand
[1:57:35] forever and when Isaiah was prophesy uh
[1:57:39] brother BR tells that God made it
[1:57:40] fragile so that it would break God made
[1:57:44] these things all these denominations and
[1:57:45] all these things were made fragile so
[1:57:48] that they could and would break but
[1:57:50] remember we got to Kingdom that's solid
[1:57:54] and that kingdom is in you as a Believer
[1:57:57] that's been born
[1:57:59] again it's a kingdom that but the Bible
[1:58:02] would say that except a man be born of
[1:58:04] water and spirit he cannot enter the
[1:58:06] kingdom but but but but you which have
[1:58:09] been born again into this Kingdom it's a
[1:58:11] kingdom which cannot be moved it's a
[1:58:14] kingdom which cannot fall apart and so
[1:58:17] if that kingdom is in you then you
[1:58:20] cannot fall apart you are a people that
[1:58:23] that cannot be moved your mind you may
[1:58:26] go back and forth and sometimes in your
[1:58:29] spirit you may be encouraged and
[1:58:31] sometimes discouraged but there is a
[1:58:33] soul that is anchored to the Rock of
[1:58:36] Ages and cannot be moved by any wind of
[1:58:40] the Devil by any fiery trial and that's
[1:58:44] why you're still here because before
[1:58:46] there ever was a world to fall apart
[1:58:49] before there ever was a denomination to
[1:58:52] fall there was a God and I was in him
[1:58:55] before the foundation of the world I I I
[1:58:58] wasn't just created Out of the Dust of
[1:59:01] this Earth but but there was a soul that
[1:59:03] was put into that dust and that Soul
[1:59:06] came from God oh a part of an immovable
[1:59:10] God an immovable
[1:59:13] Kingdom oh we can't fall apart We Won't
[1:59:16] Be
[1:59:17] Shaken so we're going to remain because
[1:59:21] we can't be
[1:59:22] shaken it says in Hebrews this word yet
[1:59:25] once more signify the removing of those
[1:59:28] things that are shaken as of things that
[1:59:30] are made that those things which cannot
[1:59:33] be shaken May
[1:59:35] remain oh why are you still here through
[1:59:40] all the trials through all the
[1:59:42] tribulations there is a kingdom which
[1:59:44] cannot be
[1:59:45] moved and so we're going to remain and
[1:59:48] to those that are alive and remain under
[1:59:50] the coming of the Lord oh there will be
[1:59:53] a change for God's people that have been
[1:59:56] established on this Kingdom oh between
[1:59:59] now and then the winds may blow and the
[2:00:02] winds may come but there is a
[2:00:05] stability oh he started the work and he
[2:00:08] can finish it would you stand to your
[2:00:11] feet amen we've received a word to end
[2:00:15] the
[2:00:16] struggle uh uh you know that in the
[2:00:19] first coming of the Lord there was a
[2:00:20] Jordan River and then his second coming
[2:00:23] there was an Ohio River in this first
[2:00:26] coming there was a mount Transfiguration
[2:00:28] but in this second coming there was a
[2:00:30] mount Sunset oh and there there was a
[2:00:33] mighty Angel clothed with a cloud and
[2:00:36] brother Brandon was up in that mount
[2:00:38] having a a having a conference with that
[2:00:41] Mighty Angel and he come back he seen he
[2:00:44] seen that vision of those constellations
[2:00:46] of birds and of angels and there was a
[2:00:49] blast that went off
[2:00:52] loud that was almost like he would
[2:00:53] describe it as kind almost like a sonic
[2:00:55] boom like something breaking the sound
[2:00:58] barrier and he would come back even
[2:01:00] thinking that maybe it was his own death
[2:01:03] but what was going on up in that
[2:01:04] mountain God was adopting his son he was
[2:01:09] coming back with a message oh that would
[2:01:12] end the struggle oh we no longer have to
[2:01:15] wander if we're baptized right we don't
[2:01:17] have to wonder what the correct Doctrine
[2:01:20] is on serpent seed and in the Trinity we
[2:01:23] have the answer that has ended the
[2:01:25] struggle oh we don't have to worry about
[2:01:27] private interpretations we have the true
[2:01:30] interpretation of the word and so what
[2:01:32] should you do just hear ye him oh let
[2:01:35] that word consume your life let that
[2:01:38] Vindicated word consume your mind and
[2:01:40] throw out every other thought say no
[2:01:43] Satan I've already heard another voice
[2:01:45] it says I'm free it says I'm going to
[2:01:48] make it it says I can have the Holy
[2:01:50] Ghost
[2:01:52] Mount what Mount Sunset wasn't the end
[2:01:54] of brother brandom no it was the end of
[2:01:56] my struggle that's it oh that like that
[2:01:59] that Paul that was chopping down that
[2:02:01] tree trying to trying to get it back to
[2:02:03] camp and he said why are you struggling
[2:02:05] just roll it into that river that river
[2:02:07] goes all the way down to Camp oh and
[2:02:09] you're struggling struggling with with
[2:02:12] the word trying to fuss with it and
[2:02:14] fight with it don't fuss with it just
[2:02:16] ride on it it's a kingdom which cannot
[2:02:18] be moved it's a Vindicated word yes oh
[2:02:22] and if you just just let it consume your
[2:02:24] life oh let it take you home back to
[2:02:28] Camp where we came from amen glory to
[2:02:32] God hallelujah amen amen amen amen may
[2:02:36] we just bow our heads for a word of
[2:02:38] prayer amen we just so love you
[2:02:41] Hallelujah so appreciate your
[2:02:43] attentiveness Hallelujah and we thank
[2:02:45] the Lord for allowing us to gather
[2:02:47] hallelujah amen and maybe it would be
[2:02:50] for the last time the Lord knows what
[2:02:51] he's doing but but he has a way of doing
[2:02:54] things and if he saw fit to T and have
[2:02:58] this meeting then I believe he had a
[2:03:00] purpose for it and maybe there be
[2:03:03] someone here tonight that you be in a
[2:03:05] struggle oh you've been trying to fight
[2:03:07] with it you've been trying to press into
[2:03:10] it but brother Brandon would say that we
[2:03:12] press and we quiver and we get in
[2:03:14] frustrations and doubts thinking I must
[2:03:17] press and he said it isn't that it's
[2:03:19] just yielding realizing that you're
[2:03:21] nothing
[2:03:22] just let him completely take you over
[2:03:24] take over your thinking take
[2:03:26] over you see maybe that fire has
[2:03:30] consumed your your flesh and you you've
[2:03:33] started to dress right you started to to
[2:03:37] put on the right kind of clothes and you
[2:03:40] come to church and maybe the fire has
[2:03:43] consumed your spirit caused you to act
[2:03:46] right cause you to have a brotherly
[2:03:49] kindness and bear the fruits of the
[2:03:50] spirit but in your soul maybe you're
[2:03:53] still struggling with this word maybe
[2:03:56] you're still struggling with the message
[2:03:58] is it even true oh that devil is no
[2:04:01] respector of persons that's right he'll
[2:04:04] attack the young people he'll attack the
[2:04:07] elders but but there is a fire it's a
[2:04:10] dissolver of all doubts and Moses could
[2:04:14] spend five minutes in the presence of
[2:04:16] that fire and be completely different
[2:04:19] you know they say a residence can be
[2:04:22] totally engulfed within 5 minutes oh and
[2:04:26] you are a three compartment person
[2:04:29] you've got a body a spirit and a soul
[2:04:33] amen but what do we need is that fire to
[2:04:36] totally consume amen every compartment
[2:04:39] of Our Lives oh the body the spirit and
[2:04:44] the Soul am all that you could have an
[2:04:47] overcoming life then you'll be able to
[2:04:50] keep the victory Hallelujah then you
[2:04:52] then you'll fall down sometimes maybe
[2:04:54] but you'll get back up if you've got a
[2:04:57] need tonight maybe you need a the
[2:05:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost maybe you need
[2:05:03] a refilling I believe we still have a
[2:05:06] high priest which can come by and refill
[2:05:09] those lamps with that oil like they did
[2:05:13] on that sacred
[2:05:15] altar Heavenly Father lord lord your

[2:06:27] take your word and fan those Flames
[2:06:29] tonight Lord and ask that that fire
