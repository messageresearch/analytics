[52:04] trusting that uh you are doing
[52:09] fine you know only a Wednesday night
[52:11] that's when the devil
[52:12] fights with traffic and things but I'm
[52:15] so thankful that today we didn't have
[52:17] traffic the Lord smiled upon us tonight
[52:20] am but nothing is going to keep us from
[52:23] church some people to to be killed to
[52:26] get a new Bible just to get a Bible I
[52:29] mean for me going through traffic it's
[52:32] that's the little that I can do I won't
[52:34] be able to stand with the people in the
[52:37] Dark Ages that were killed for for
[52:40] coming together I may not be able to
[52:43] stand with those they have a greater
[52:45] testimony the only thing I can do is to
[52:47] sit in my car and go through the
[52:50] traffic Hallelujah that's the little
[52:53] that I can do praise be to the the Lord
[52:55] amen you may uh stand and let us read
[52:58] the Bible at this
[53:02] time
[53:04] amen uh we're going to read from Genesis
[53:07] chapter 5 if you have your Bibles
[53:10] Genesis chapter 5 and we we'll start
[53:14] reading from verse
[53:17] 21 amen if you have it you can say amen
[53:21] amen Genesis is the first book in the
[53:24] Bible
[53:26] you all of you know that but we have
[53:28] little ones in church and they have to
[53:31] hear it also
[53:33] right Genesis chapter
[53:36] 5 verse 21 and Enoch lived 60 and5 years
[53:42] yes sir and begat
[53:44] Methuselah and Enoch walked with God
[53:47] after he had begat Methuselah 300 years
[53:52] and beget sons and daughters and all of
[53:55] the days of Enoch were 365
[53:59] years and Enoch walked with God and he
[54:02] was not for God took him amen you may
[54:07] have your seats amen for a little time
[54:10] tonight we want to talk about the
[54:13] patriarch Enoch and for our subtitle
[54:16] it's our walk into translation amen amen
[54:21] Enoch is indeed a patriarch yes the
[54:25] prophet spent a lot of time talking
[54:27] about the patriarch Abraham that's right
[54:30] because a patriarch is the uh he's the
[54:35] the one that begins that that starts
[54:37] something he like a Pioneer that becomes
[54:41] a patriarch you know or a family Elder
[54:44] so Abraham was the father of Faith as as
[54:48] you know as Bible readers would call him
[54:50] sir he was he was not the only one with
[54:52] faith but he he reached a certain level
[54:56] where God said you're going to be the
[54:58] father of Nations up until now we are
[55:01] called the Sons of Abraham and he was a
[55:05] patriarch because everyone traces their
[55:07] roots to Abraham that's right the the
[55:09] Muslims they say Abraham is our father
[55:12] the Christians they say Abraham is our
[55:14] father the Jews they say Abraham is our
[55:18] father so Abraham that makes Abraham a
[55:22] patriarch and his wife was a
[55:25] matriarch amen sometimes we talk about
[55:28] Patriarchs but we forget about
[55:30] matriarchs they are there in the Bible
[55:33] because God was very
[55:36] specific he says you will have a son by
[55:40] your wife
[55:41] Sarah it was not just random God was
[55:45] very specific when God called Abraham he
[55:50] also called Sarah so so so we are
[55:53] thankful for the great women of of the
[55:55] Bible who knew how to support their
[55:58] husband in the ministry and tonight we
[56:00] are also thankful for the sisters that
[56:02] we have in church you know people think
[56:05] that you know we as as message Believers
[56:08] we look down upon women no we are the
[56:10] people that respect women more than any
[56:13] other group in the world we respect
[56:16] women to an extent that we don't want
[56:18] them to go naked we don't we respect
[56:22] women right that we are willing to work
[56:25] five six jobs just to keep them at home
[56:29] so that they can enjoy and then don't
[56:31] have to worry about bills so if you are
[56:35] married by a
[56:36] Christian you are married to
[56:39] royalty
[56:41] hallelujah praise be to
[56:46] God we respect women that's why we
[56:49] believe in making a vow to one and
[56:52] forsake all others we are the only only
[56:55] people that makes that vow Hallelujah up
[56:59] until death so if somebody says message
[57:02] believers they don't respect women he
[57:04] doesn't know what he's talking
[57:07] about they he does not know we are the
[57:11] only institution that does not
[57:13] administer
[57:17] divorce we do not administer
[57:21] divorce brother Steven is a marriage
[57:23] officer that's it is not a divorce
[57:28] [Applause]
[57:31] officer Hallelujah am this is just so
[57:35] that I can warm up the sisters to get
[57:36] their
[57:41] amens I like I like the sisters in this
[57:45] church because they they they say
[57:48] amens praise be to God so Brothers make
[57:52] sure that the sisters are not leading
[57:53] with the amens
[57:58] so
[58:00] Enoch was walked with God until he was
[58:04] not that's right so you when you walk
[58:07] with God yes sir you are walking towards
[58:10] a certain
[58:11] goal you are not just walking with God
[58:16] you there's a Target when God is working
[58:19] with you it's a journey it's it's it's
[58:22] not it's not like a dog walk where
[58:25] you're just walking around you know
[58:27] where just loitering around when you are
[58:30] walking with God you are going somewhere
[58:34] he may not tell you where he's taking
[58:37] you to but he's taking you somewhere
[58:41] that's why he said unto Abraham leave
[58:44] thy mother and thy father yes sir and go
[58:47] to a place yes that I shall show you he
[58:51] did not know where that place was but he
[58:54] knew that God was taking him somewhere
[58:56] yes my brother and tonight we know that
[58:58] God is taking us somewhere amen
[59:01] hallelujah yes sir we are on a journey
[59:03] to go somewhere friend my brother and by
[59:06] the grace of God by the opening of the
[59:08] seals yes sir we have an idea what that
[59:10] somewh is amen although we know that eye
[59:13] has not seen Ear Has Not Heard sir what
[59:17] God has in store to Those whom he love
[59:21] that's right praise be to God Amen so
[59:23] when you walk with God you are going
[59:26] somewhere amen amen amen so in the verse
[59:29] that we read Enoch was going somewhere
[59:33] somewhere yes my brother and the end of
[59:36] Enoch's Journey take your time was
[59:40] translation Hallelujah yes my brother
[59:43] that was the end of Enoch's Journey amen
[59:46] right yes sir so this is God he calls
[59:49] Enoch yes sir and he takes him on this
[59:51] journey yes sir to translation amen amen
[59:55] amen is that
[59:57] right we know what you're talking
[1:00:01] about we know what you're preaching
[1:00:06] about praise be to
[1:00:11] God Amen so you see that God was taking
[1:00:15] Enoch towards translation amen so when
[1:00:18] God called Abraham he had a place where
[1:00:20] he was taking him to yes sir so every
[1:00:23] one of us when God called us calls us he
[1:00:26] is taking us somewhere God does not take
[1:00:29] people call people in vain and they just
[1:00:32] are sitting around and not doing
[1:00:34] something when God calls you he takes
[1:00:39] you
[1:00:40] somewhere you might not know but he's
[1:00:42] got a plan for you and God has a plan
[1:00:46] for every specific person that CA amen
[1:00:50] he's got a plan for brother Greg right
[1:00:52] here he's got a plan for brother Seth
[1:00:54] plan for brother Kelly God takes us on a
[1:00:59] journey and God loves to
[1:01:03] walk he would come in the cool of the
[1:01:05] evening time and he'd come in the garden
[1:01:09] and he would walk with Adam amen because
[1:01:12] God loves to walk with his people yes my
[1:01:15] brother Hallelujah yes my brother so so
[1:01:18] so so Enoch was the seventh from Adam
[1:01:22] yes my brother how many knows that
[1:01:24] according to the genealogies of the
[1:01:26] Bible yes sir and we remember when Adam
[1:01:29] when when when men fell when Adam fell
[1:01:32] the Bible says that be the day that you
[1:01:35] shall eat you shall surely die that's
[1:01:38] right so everyone began to die and when
[1:01:41] you read from chapter five in from
[1:01:43] chapter one it tells you that Seth lived
[1:01:46] this these many years and he died that's
[1:01:49] and Enos lived 1200 years and died
[1:01:51] that's and Canaan lived uh for for these
[1:01:54] many years and died and Halo and Jared
[1:01:58] lived all these years and died but when
[1:02:00] you come to Enoch there's a change in
[1:02:04] the
[1:02:05] pattern Hallelujah when it comes to
[1:02:08] Enoch the 7th the pattern
[1:02:12] changes God takes a corner because
[1:02:15] remember God is a builder and he's a
[1:02:18] wise master builder and he's not
[1:02:20] building a straight line he's building a
[1:02:23] building so you you have to watch the
[1:02:25] corners when God takes a
[1:02:31] corner and Enoch had so much faith that
[1:02:35] he broke
[1:02:37] precedent Enoch had so much faith that
[1:02:41] he broke the pattern of his
[1:02:44] family and I believe tonight that by
[1:02:48] Faith by faith even if you say my
[1:02:51] grandfather had asthma my father had as
[1:02:54] you can break the pattern by
[1:02:57] [Applause]
[1:03:00] faith
[1:03:02] Hallelujah you can say oh my grandmother
[1:03:05] had temper my mother had temper but by
[1:03:08] faith I overcame that
[1:03:11] temper Faith breaks
[1:03:16] patterns that's why I don't believe in
[1:03:19] inheriting
[1:03:20] diseases I don't believe in inheriting
[1:03:23] problems I believe in inheriting
[1:03:27] Solutions
[1:03:29] Hallelujah the devil will tell you oh
[1:03:32] your grandfather did this all the
[1:03:34] negative things but he would never come
[1:03:36] to you and tell you your dead your
[1:03:38] grandfather was a great entrepreneur so
[1:03:40] you are going to be a great
[1:03:42] entrepreneur sir the devil never tell
[1:03:44] you your father was a great peaceful man
[1:03:46] so you're going to be a peaceful man he
[1:03:49] comes with the
[1:03:51] negatives and because people believe it
[1:03:54] it they accept it then they live in that
[1:03:58] but Enoch was
[1:04:01] different even if God said You shall die
[1:04:05] but Enoch
[1:04:08] defied Hallelujah when you have faith
[1:04:11] you can set a new
[1:04:14] president preach preach my
[1:04:17] brother Hallelujah because everyone else
[1:04:21] that was dying was operating at a
[1:04:23] certain level fath that's exactly right
[1:04:26] that's exactly the lutherans were
[1:04:28] operating at a certain level of Faith
[1:04:30] right John Wesley was at a level of
[1:04:33] Faith Columba was at a level of Faith
[1:04:36] but when Elijah comes he brings a new
[1:04:39] level of faith that breaks the CT of
[1:04:46] death that's why we cannot do the things
[1:04:49] the same way the denominations are doing
[1:04:52] because we have got a higher calling
[1:04:55] we have got a higher mission to
[1:04:58] accomplish we cannot be you know
[1:05:00] repeating the same messages that the
[1:05:02] denominations are preaching we cannot be
[1:05:05] running after the same things the
[1:05:07] denominations are running
[1:05:09] after because when Israel was moving yes
[1:05:12] sir God says this is Mount SE and it
[1:05:15] belongs to Esau and that is not your
[1:05:18] mountain and I not going to give you
[1:05:21] that mountain that is not your
[1:05:23] inheritance that's
[1:05:25] EXA that's exactly so you have to know
[1:05:28] your
[1:05:29] inheritance and what is not your
[1:05:33] inheritance because remember Abraham had
[1:05:36] many sons that's right but the Bible
[1:05:39] says he gave them gifts and he sent them
[1:05:42] away but unto Isaac he gave him all his
[1:05:47] [Applause]
[1:05:50] substance and when when brother Bram
[1:05:52] walked into or Robert's office
[1:05:54] remember I told you before he says Lord
[1:05:56] you gave him this highrise building you
[1:06:00] gave him all these wonderful things I
[1:06:01] only have one sister who my secretary
[1:06:04] she's an old type
[1:06:06] writer and the Holy Ghost said look
[1:06:09] up I am your portion this is not your
[1:06:13] Mountain I am your
[1:06:15] [Applause]
[1:06:18] portion sometimes you know we get
[1:06:20] carried away by things that we see but
[1:06:23] that may not be your
[1:06:25] God has a better portion for you up
[1:06:27] there God has a better price for you up
[1:06:30] there
[1:06:32] Hallelujah don't get envious when you
[1:06:34] see the unbelievers driving around with
[1:06:37] super cars and say oh
[1:06:40] Lord if only I can have a
[1:06:43] Lamborghini that may not be your portion
[1:06:45] my brother maybe your portion is playing
[1:06:48] the guitar and God gives you a price up
[1:06:51] [Applause]
[1:06:53] there am am
[1:06:57] am so God is the portion of his
[1:07:02] people he says he says Abraham I'm your
[1:07:05] exceedingly great reward I am your
[1:07:08] portion and your exceedingly great
[1:07:11] reward which means our portion in this
[1:07:14] age yes sir is God our portion is God
[1:07:20] it's the Holy Ghost it's the word
[1:07:24] because the word and the Holy Ghost is
[1:07:25] the same
[1:07:27] thing the Pentecostals they have their
[1:07:30] portion the hypocrit the Jesus Christ
[1:07:33] said they receive their reward in
[1:07:37] food but we have a different price than
[1:07:41] the Hypocrites how many knows that and
[1:07:44] that's why our life and our conduct is
[1:07:46] different because we have got a
[1:07:48] different
[1:07:52] calling
[1:07:57] Hallelujah I see people trying to run
[1:07:59] after the Pentecostals that's not your
[1:08:01] portion we are egos
[1:08:05] friends
[1:08:07] now Genesis chapter 17 verse1 let's
[1:08:11] let's open that that scripture yes
[1:08:14] brother when is the night of teaching
[1:08:17] yes take your time how many love
[1:08:20] teaching amen amen amen
[1:08:25] teaching stabilizes the
[1:08:28] church as I was reading a a quote with
[1:08:32] brother saying I want to have a teaching
[1:08:35] Revival says all all you allers how many
[1:08:37] remembers when we used to take the book
[1:08:39] of Exodus and would spend weeks on it
[1:08:42] amen if you look at brother bram's
[1:08:44] meetings it was teaching if you look at
[1:08:48] the great you know Hebrews series The
[1:08:52] Prophet was teaching and that's a
[1:08:54] wonderful message amen you think about
[1:08:56] adoption he was teaching on Ephesians
[1:08:58] you think about the seals he was
[1:09:00] teaching amen you see that was the
[1:09:02] climax of of of his
[1:09:04] ministry we love healing campaigns and
[1:09:07] we will continue to have them out there
[1:09:09] when we are trying to to to win souls
[1:09:12] right but when we come here we still
[1:09:15] pray for the sick but that's not the
[1:09:17] main event
[1:09:21] friends we still healing is part of the
[1:09:25] word we cannot take healing out of the
[1:09:28] word the prophet says healing is the
[1:09:31] children's
[1:09:33] bread but now you cannot give your child
[1:09:36] inheritance for bread
[1:09:39] only when you if you are a wealthy
[1:09:41] father you can't say my children I'm
[1:09:44] Only leing You
[1:09:45] bread friends you give them your
[1:09:49] estate Hallelujah you give them your
[1:09:51] stocks you give them your l you give
[1:09:54] them your estat and then you give them
[1:09:56] bread it's part of the
[1:09:59] package but the children cannot just be
[1:10:01] satisfied by
[1:10:04] [Music]
[1:10:07] Bread you said you have to have a
[1:10:10] balance that's right because having a
[1:10:12] balance that's why you see Priests of
[1:10:15] oath they were ordained by God to to
[1:10:19] have the right kind of measurements
[1:10:22] because measurements bring balance am
[1:10:25] God was very specific he would say an e
[1:10:28] of flour that's right a heel of oil
[1:10:31] that's right right you you cannot put 16
[1:10:35] teaspoons of salt in a cake uh uhuh
[1:10:41] uh it's no longer a
[1:10:45] cake we put 10 cups of
[1:10:48] flour and a pinch of sugar no are you
[1:10:52] going to have a cake no
[1:10:54] are they the correct ingredients yes are
[1:10:57] they the right quantities
[1:10:59] no so someone will say no brother it's
[1:11:02] in the word yes it's in the word but it
[1:11:05] has to be placed
[1:11:08] right you have to place it
[1:11:11] right pre pre is is this a
[1:11:16] microphone I'm going to put it here take
[1:11:19] your
[1:11:20] time
[1:11:22] goad
[1:11:30] micone pre preach the microphone has to
[1:11:35] be placed right right
[1:11:39] friends yes sir you can have a a guitar
[1:11:42] a microphone but if you don't place them
[1:11:44] right that's right no
[1:11:47] Harmony take your time take your
[1:11:52] time
[1:11:54] preach imagine you walk into a home and
[1:11:57] you're in the kitchen there you find
[1:11:59] toilet paper in the
[1:12:01] kitchen something is wrong friends
[1:12:05] preach my
[1:12:06] brother preach you say Pastor can you
[1:12:09] pray for that
[1:12:10] sister I think she's going through a lot
[1:12:13] that's exactly because things are not
[1:12:15] properly placed amen amen
[1:12:18] amen amen but but when the right
[1:12:21] teaching comes that's right places
[1:12:24] positionally places everything there's a
[1:12:27] place for musicians there's a placing of
[1:12:30] deacons there's a placing of evangelist
[1:12:33] there's a placing of of of gift that's
[1:12:35] exactly right Hallelujah we want gifts
[1:12:38] in the church but they have to be placed
[1:12:40] right amen amen amen amen amen
[1:12:45] preach but when you have somebody taking
[1:12:48] one hour trying to speak in a tongue
[1:12:52] it's not properly placed
[1:12:54] the Holy Ghost would just say something
[1:12:56] and then we write it down the elders who
[1:12:58] know what it is in its right
[1:13:01] place yes brother Hallelujah so Genesis
[1:13:05] 17 God says yes sir when Abraham was 90
[1:13:08] years old the Bible says the Lord
[1:13:10] appeared to Abraham and said unto him I
[1:13:13] am the Lord
[1:13:16] Almighty walk before me am and be thou
[1:13:22] perfect
[1:13:24] so so when you walk with God you are
[1:13:26] going towards something so God to
[1:13:29] Abraham he says after you walk with me
[1:13:33] you are going to be
[1:13:35] perfect remember we we we told you what
[1:13:38] Perfection is perfection is
[1:13:42] maturity because you cannot you cannot
[1:13:45] have it harest something unless it's
[1:13:48] perfect or it's mature but when
[1:13:51] something is mature then you can put it
[1:13:54] in the Garner so God said unto
[1:13:57] Abraham walk before me or walk with me
[1:14:01] in other words then you shall be perfect
[1:14:05] so to reach Perfection we have to walk
[1:14:08] with
[1:14:11] God so now now remember sir the old
[1:14:15] Saints the Bible says that they without
[1:14:18] us that's right could not be made what
[1:14:21] perfect so which means we have the
[1:14:24] promise of coming to
[1:14:28] Perfection Hallelujah we have the
[1:14:31] promise of coming into
[1:14:34] Perfection oh
[1:14:38] my because our Perfection it triggers
[1:14:41] the
[1:14:42] resurrection because when we meet the
[1:14:44] Lord in the air sir but we cannot hinder
[1:14:47] those that are asleep that's right but
[1:14:50] that process for it to come we which are
[1:14:53] life and remain have to come to
[1:14:57] Perfection but for us to come to
[1:14:59] Perfection we have to walk with
[1:15:03] God now God is a
[1:15:07] spirit and they that walk with God they
[1:15:09] walk in the spirit and the Bible says
[1:15:12] the sons of God are led by the spirit of
[1:15:16] God now if we are walking in the flesh
[1:15:19] we are not walking with God if we have
[1:15:22] to walk with God
[1:15:24] we have to walk in the
[1:15:26] spirit so when we say Enoch walked with
[1:15:30] God we are saying Enoch was working in
[1:15:33] the
[1:15:34] [Applause]
[1:15:39] spirit yes of course there are times
[1:15:42] when God would physically come God can
[1:15:44] do that the prophet says he loves to
[1:15:47] manifest himself to his people that's
[1:15:49] exactly but if but but if you want to
[1:15:51] read it correctly it's working in the
[1:15:56] spirit so when you see children's book
[1:15:59] you you know walking and and and and God
[1:16:02] walking that's fine you know but but
[1:16:05] really when you walk in the word when
[1:16:08] you walk in the spirit of God then you
[1:16:11] are walking with
[1:16:16] God yes my brother so so so Abraham was
[1:16:20] being called to a walk of Faith yes my
[1:16:22] brother for him to be perfect
[1:16:26] amen because
[1:16:28] remember one thing I'll tell you is this
[1:16:31] we are men of the Flesh and we have
[1:16:33] natural senses but God says if you want
[1:16:36] to be perfect you have to walk in the
[1:16:39] spirit and bypass your senses so Enoch
[1:16:43] worked with God now let's continue
[1:16:46] reading
[1:16:48] here the prophet talks
[1:16:51] about I'm laying it Foundation yes in
[1:16:54] the message testimony says and all of a
[1:16:56] sudden something happened it seems like
[1:16:58] in every principle I was a young boy
[1:17:00] again I didn't know what mentally taken
[1:17:03] place or what it was and I looked
[1:17:06] standing in front of her and there in
[1:17:08] front of me and they stood just the way
[1:17:10] she was when I married her so this
[1:17:13] Prophet had this experience sir he would
[1:17:16] G to have you know a memorial of his
[1:17:19] marriage a honeymoon trip right you know
[1:17:22] anniversary trip so he was walking in
[1:17:25] this forest and he said he caus it a
[1:17:27] virgin Forest now all these things are
[1:17:29] symbols friends yes my brother you know
[1:17:31] he was walking in this virgin
[1:17:35] forest and a voice said to him yes sir
[1:17:39] do you want to walk with me Hallelujah
[1:17:42] and he says of course Lord it would be
[1:17:45] my greatest pleasure to walk with you
[1:17:48] and remember when God comes Hallelujah
[1:17:51] when God would come to Adam he would
[1:17:54] come as a voice that's exactly because
[1:17:57] Adam says I heard your voice walking so
[1:18:01] when God is walking it's a voice so when
[1:18:04] we are walking in Christ we become
[1:18:06] walking voices of
[1:18:09] God so the voice comes to the prophet am
[1:18:13] and he says don't you want to walk with
[1:18:15] me because he was in another way another
[1:18:20] you know adopted son that's exactly and
[1:18:22] God says I want to walk with you because
[1:18:25] God always long to walk with his
[1:18:29] people and he says and and and and and
[1:18:32] the prophet was walking with God in that
[1:18:34] forest and tears were going down his
[1:18:37] beard Hallelujah and as he was walking
[1:18:40] says something happened says I don't
[1:18:42] know what it isad it was as if I was
[1:18:46] young again and my wife was young again
[1:18:50] Hallelujah he was showing us the mystery
[1:18:54] yes sir that this bride yes because
[1:18:57] remember the wife of a minister or of a
[1:19:00] prophet sometimes they typify the
[1:19:04] church how many knows that if if you
[1:19:07] read Ezekiel if you read all the
[1:19:09] prophets of old God would even if you H
[1:19:12] Hosea God said to Hosea go and marry a
[1:19:15] prostitute because it's supposed to be a
[1:19:21] type how many knows that yes that hosas
[1:19:24] married
[1:19:26] GMA that's right a prostitute right
[1:19:29] because it was supposed to be a type and
[1:19:32] by by Hosea Maring a
[1:19:34] prostitute he was declaring the word of
[1:19:38] the
[1:19:39] Lord now the prophets they they declare
[1:19:42] the word by speech but they also declare
[1:19:45] the word by their life brother
[1:19:48] Hallelujah brother because the the
[1:19:51] message and the messenger out one yes my
[1:19:54] brother take your time take your time so
[1:19:57] when when HOSA was marrying GMA yes that
[1:20:00] was the word that was the word of
[1:20:02] [Applause]
[1:20:04] God when God said to to to Jeremiah your
[1:20:08] wife is going to die don't weep that was
[1:20:11] the word of the
[1:20:13] Lord when Moses married Zora that was
[1:20:16] the word of the
[1:20:17] [Applause]
[1:20:19] Lord when Jonah was in the belly of the
[1:20:22] fish
[1:20:23] that was the word of the Lord the life
[1:20:26] of the Prophet is thus says the
[1:20:28] [Applause]
[1:20:34] Lord
[1:20:36] hallelujah praise be to
[1:20:39] God glory I mean that's a bit deep but
[1:20:42] it's fine some people say brother you're
[1:20:45] becoming a
[1:20:47] fanatic but that's Bible
[1:20:50] friends that's the Bible amen amen amen
[1:20:54] amen amen because you
[1:20:57] see because prophets of God yes yes
[1:21:02] remember there was a brother Bram prayed
[1:21:04] for two boys one got healed that's right
[1:21:07] and the other one was sick and dying and
[1:21:11] he saw a vision and the prophet go and
[1:21:13] the angel told him for this one to leave
[1:21:16] you have to eat this that's exactly
[1:21:18] right by eating that it was a symbolic
[1:21:21] that this one will Al be healed that's
[1:21:24] exactly so prophets of God they also
[1:21:27] leave the word of God that's exactly
[1:21:30] right that's why yes we emulate the
[1:21:33] prophets
[1:21:35] 100% but there's a difference between me
[1:21:37] and the prophet exactly the prophet
[1:21:40] could take a cigarette and the angel
[1:21:43] would take it from his hands right if I
[1:21:46] take a cigarette nobody will take it out
[1:21:49] of my hands I am not a prophet
[1:21:53] [Applause]
[1:21:57] PR Hallelujah when I came to the message
[1:22:02] I received Christ yes sir that's when I
[1:22:04] started to sanctify my life the Holy
[1:22:06] Ghost working through me but a prophet
[1:22:09] is Sanctified from birth that's
[1:22:11] exactly yes brother God sanctifies a
[1:22:15] prophet from
[1:22:17] birth you don't you don't you don't you
[1:22:20] don't come out of nowhere and say well
[1:22:23] God has called me to be a prophet I've
[1:22:25] stopped playing with women that doesn't
[1:22:28] work like that if God makes you a
[1:22:30] prophet he cleanses you from
[1:22:34] birth
[1:22:36] [Applause]
[1:22:38] preach
[1:22:40] Hallelujah that's why I don't believe
[1:22:42] this modern day
[1:22:43] prophets someone just comes from from
[1:22:45] prison says I'm now a prophet no it
[1:22:48] doesn't work like
[1:22:50] that GL to God
[1:23:00] Hallelujah now the word
[1:23:03] Enoch means dedicated
[1:23:06] am it means trained
[1:23:10] Hallelujah Enoch for him to come into
[1:23:14] translation he had to be
[1:23:19] dedicated he had to be
[1:23:21] dedicated
[1:23:23] and he had to be trained yes sir Journey
[1:23:27] pre my brother preach and he had to be
[1:23:32] what now who trains the son before
[1:23:34] adoption go ahead my brother go ahead go
[1:23:38] ahead who trains the son before
[1:23:41] adoption it's the tutor which is the
[1:23:43] Holy Ghost so Enoch had to walk with the
[1:23:46] Holy Ghost am from here to here
[1:23:51] hallelujah he had to be under training
[1:23:54] and he had to be
[1:23:55] dedicated Enoch was not a man who was
[1:23:58] coming to church every
[1:24:00] once in six
[1:24:02] months Enoch was was not a man who would
[1:24:06] open his Bible once a year no Enoch was
[1:24:11] dedicated Enoch was trained by the Holy
[1:24:16] Ghost AM was not a man who say oh I
[1:24:20] don't know what happened I ended up
[1:24:21] going to the Club no no no no no you
[1:24:24] know was trained by the power of the
[1:24:27] Holy Ghost yes my brother yes my
[1:24:30] brother so for us to come into
[1:24:34] translation which is the rapture goad
[1:24:36] which is our Perfection sir the Holy
[1:24:38] Ghost has to take us through the same
[1:24:41] Journey friend yes my brother because
[1:24:45] remember let's go back to Genesis
[1:24:47] chapter 5 now I may not be able to
[1:24:49] finish but we don't preach to finish
[1:24:51] part two my brother we preach to speak
[1:24:54] the
[1:24:55] truth the prophet was I was listening to
[1:24:57] the message the Rapture the prophet says
[1:25:00] I've got 10 pages left you We Don't
[1:25:03] Preach to
[1:25:05] finish now the Bible says now Enoch
[1:25:08] lived 65 years yes sir and he begat
[1:25:12] Methuselah Hallelujah yes sir so Enoch
[1:25:14] was just a manh and he beget what methus
[1:25:18] right right Hallelujah yes sir so so
[1:25:21] Enoch yes sir now I want you to I want
[1:25:24] you to stay with me very closely yes my
[1:25:26] brother Enoch was the son of Jared who
[1:25:29] was the son of you know Mahal Enos and
[1:25:32] so on and Adam so Enoch was in the right
[1:25:37] lineage and Enoch had had a seat of
[1:25:40] eternal
[1:25:41] life amen hallelujah brother because for
[1:25:46] because when you come to the world even
[1:25:48] before you you have that seed of eternal
[1:25:50] life in sh yes you have that city of
[1:25:53] eternal life because if you are Eternal
[1:25:56] you always Eternal am am but what
[1:26:00] happens with Enoch when he when he was
[1:26:02] 65 years old go ahead now he beges
[1:26:06] methus right which was a type of the new
[1:26:10] birth because methos was the eighth
[1:26:14] because Enoch was the seventh that's
[1:26:16] right so so so methus being the eth
[1:26:19] because remember eight is the number of
[1:26:21] new begin
[1:26:23] yes sir so when when when when Enoch be
[1:26:25] methus which is the eighth from Adam
[1:26:28] that was a type of Enoch becoming Born
[1:26:32] Again standing again yes Hallelujah so
[1:26:36] when Enoch was born
[1:26:38] again he started to walk with God
[1:26:41] because the prophet says when you are
[1:26:43] born again that is not the end of the
[1:26:47] journey that's the beginning of the
[1:26:50] journey so when Enoch be
[1:26:54] meus that was his new
[1:26:56] birth in a type then he walked with God
[1:27:00] for 300 years yes my brother until he
[1:27:04] was not
[1:27:05] found and this translation hallelujah
[1:27:09] how many knows that the Rapture is is is
[1:27:12] is is is the translation that's exactly
[1:27:14] and how many knows that the Rapture is
[1:27:16] the adoption Naturally Speaking because
[1:27:19] the Bible says in the Book of Romans
[1:27:21] that we are growing
[1:27:23] we are Longing To Be
[1:27:25] clothed because remember we are
[1:27:27] predestinated unto the adoption of sons
[1:27:31] so we are adopted spiritually and we are
[1:27:34] also adopted naturally which is the
[1:27:38] rapture when God takes us to
[1:27:41] himself but when we are here the spirit
[1:27:43] is crying out AB father exactly
[1:27:48] right so methus yes sir the name methus
[1:27:51] means
[1:27:54] Hallelujah take your time let me see if
[1:27:56] I have it here on the slide now meth
[1:27:59] means you know when when when he after
[1:28:03] you know when he's gone then it comes
[1:28:05] right so so methus was speaking of the
[1:28:08] coming
[1:28:09] judgment Hallelujah yes sir because
[1:28:12] remember Enoch was a prophet right was
[1:28:14] the prophet in the message the Rapture
[1:28:18] he says the first Rapture was Enoch and
[1:28:21] the word of the Lord came to Enoch
[1:28:22] that's right and and Jude said right
[1:28:25] Enoch prophesied that's exactly right of
[1:28:28] these men that's exactly Enoch was a
[1:28:31] prophet that's exactly so when he be
[1:28:33] methus he CAU a revelation right because
[1:28:37] remember Enoch was living in a day that
[1:28:40] is similar to our day that's exactly
[1:28:43] right because God would not have sent no
[1:28:46] yes sir and the flat if the people were
[1:28:50] not Wicked that's it exactly right but
[1:28:52] the Bible says that the Earth was
[1:28:54] wickeded that's right and there was
[1:28:55] violence that's right and people were
[1:28:57] eating and drinking that's right but it
[1:29:00] did not start in the days of Noah no sir
[1:29:03] it started in the days of Enoch amen and
[1:29:06] then Noah was the one that brought the
[1:29:09] Judgment that's exactly right how many
[1:29:11] knows that that's exactly right because
[1:29:13] the prophet says Noah was a type of the
[1:29:16] church that went through the tribulation
[1:29:18] how many knows that sir but Enoch was
[1:29:21] the type of the Bride the rapt but Enoch
[1:29:24] was living in an evil time that's right
[1:29:28] how do we know you said brother Aron how
[1:29:30] do we know that because God sent
[1:29:32] judgment and why would Enoch let's go to
[1:29:35] Jude chapter one yes my brother
[1:29:38] yes why would Enoch
[1:29:41] prophesy of evil man yes my brother if
[1:29:46] you go to Jude chapter one yes sir right
[1:29:48] the Bible talks about you know Jude is
[1:29:50] the second book from
[1:29:52] Revelations right yes sir one chapter
[1:29:56] yeah chapter one which verse is that
[1:29:58] someone can shout it shout it to
[1:30:00] me verse 14 verse 14 right thank you
[1:30:03] brother and Enoch also the seventh from
[1:30:06] Adam you know Jude had to
[1:30:09] specify you know other people they would
[1:30:12] say so and so but they he had to be very
[1:30:18] specific the seven from Adam prophet
[1:30:22] side of these saying behold the Lord
[1:30:23] cometh with 10 thousands of his Saints
[1:30:27] so so Enoch was preaching the second
[1:30:30] coming of
[1:30:31] Christ because remember Enoch was a
[1:30:35] type of the later day messageer of the
[1:30:39] hour and Enoch had to preach the coming
[1:30:43] of the Lord so here Jude is
[1:30:46] saying Enoch prophesied behold the Lord
[1:30:50] cometh he's preaching the coming of the
[1:30:52] Lord because remember the Bible it spoke
[1:30:55] it spoke more of the second coming of
[1:30:57] Christ than the first coming of Christ
[1:31:00] amen that's why the seals are very very
[1:31:03] important because they are talking about
[1:31:05] the coming of the Lord amen amen amen
[1:31:08] amen
[1:31:10] am saying behold the Lord cometh with 10
[1:31:13] thousands of his Saints yes sir to
[1:31:16] execute judgment yes sir upon all the
[1:31:18] Earth and to convince all that are
[1:31:20] ungodly among them all of ungodly Deeds
[1:31:25] which they have ungodly committed
[1:31:27] Hallelujah so Enoch was talking about
[1:31:30] the coming of the Lord and he was
[1:31:32] talking about judgment yes sir because
[1:31:34] Enoch was living in an evil time right
[1:31:37] but although Enoch was living in an evil
[1:31:40] time he was dedicated he was trained he
[1:31:44] was the type of the Church of the Bride
[1:31:47] that would come in the last days that
[1:31:49] though we are living in laia that's
[1:31:52] right yet will be dedicated unto the
[1:31:54] Lord that's right yes my brother yes my
[1:31:58] brother Hallelujah yes sir praise be to
[1:32:01] God Amen can I can I take can I go
[1:32:04] slowly uhhuh take your time now the
[1:32:07] prophet says I was born under a Nazarite
[1:32:10] birth that's exactly of course it's just
[1:32:13] a little different and so many things I
[1:32:15] do in my life I wouldn't ask other
[1:32:18] people to do it goad brother I wouldn't
[1:32:20] say they had to do it be Christians
[1:32:23] because it was different all together
[1:32:26] the prophet was a Enoch was a type of
[1:32:29] the Prophet or the prophet was the
[1:32:31] antitype of Enoch right and he is coming
[1:32:34] now as the as the seventh angel that's
[1:32:37] right Hallelujah yes sir was Enoch we
[1:32:39] can type him as the bright but we can
[1:32:41] also type him as Elijah the prophet our
[1:32:45] Prophet brother Brenham right yes and he
[1:32:47] says I was born under a Nazarite vow
[1:32:51] that's right
[1:32:52] what is the na it's a vow of Holiness
[1:32:54] right so he says I don't I wouldn't ask
[1:32:57] other people to do it so Enoch had
[1:33:00] brothers and sisters that were going to
[1:33:03] church but Enoch's walk was a little bit
[1:33:06] different yes brother but Enoch did not
[1:33:10] ask other people to be like him Enoch
[1:33:13] had a revelation that he was
[1:33:17] different preach my
[1:33:20] brother preach
[1:33:22] amen and the prophet says you see and
[1:33:25] her hair is given to not a hat lady her
[1:33:28] hair is given the Bible said right shows
[1:33:32] she's a Nazarite unto the Lord that's
[1:33:34] right says the sisters the reason why
[1:33:36] they keep their long hair it's a nazer
[1:33:37] right vow unto the Lord because they
[1:33:40] remember our sisters oh praise be to God
[1:33:43] in the preview of the Bride the prophet
[1:33:46] says I saw the ladies and I could see
[1:33:49] their hair long and they Walking In step
[1:33:53] like onwards Christian Soldier and they
[1:33:55] were going up into heaven am but there
[1:33:59] was another church which was decked in
[1:34:02] Gray and they had fig leaves they
[1:34:06] covering they part with fig leaves and
[1:34:08] the prophet says they were dancing to
[1:34:10] rock and roll they were dancing to f a
[1:34:14] POA Hallelujah you didn't think I was
[1:34:17] going to say that I said
[1:34:20] it my brother they were temping to room
[1:34:25] yes to rock and draw that's right but
[1:34:27] this other bride was walking in Step yes
[1:34:31] Hallelujah yes yes he never
[1:34:37] promised Hallelujah yes my brother they
[1:34:40] were singing the Christian songs going
[1:34:42] up to heaven that's right but this other
[1:34:45] one in one quote the prophet says I saw
[1:34:49] a being led by a witch ahuh yes sir
[1:34:53] Hallelujah yes my brother anyway that's
[1:34:56] a different subject because remember
[1:34:58] Jezebel was a witch how many knows that
[1:35:01] she Bewitched the people right because
[1:35:04] Jezebel Bewitched the people because
[1:35:06] remember there were three things that
[1:35:08] destroyed the church that's right
[1:35:10] Jezebel nikans and bism that's right how
[1:35:13] many knows that that's right praise be
[1:35:15] to God yes sir so a witch is not what
[1:35:18] you see in in in you know in children's
[1:35:20] books of somebody on on on on his sck
[1:35:24] no it's a foolish Galatians who has Beed
[1:35:28] you that's witchcraft when you are taken
[1:35:31] from the word amen amen and you are
[1:35:34] plunged into creat that's right that
[1:35:37] spiritual witchcraft that's exactly
[1:35:40] right that's exactly don't be afraid of
[1:35:43] the
[1:35:43] village that's not going to send you to
[1:35:46] Hell Beware of the Witchcraft that
[1:35:49] Bewitched the Galatians amen amen amen
[1:35:52] amen don't say oh I don't go to The
[1:35:54] Village at night during the day because
[1:35:57] they will see me with my card go to the
[1:35:59] Village my brother you are a Christian
[1:36:02] yes yes yes it's people that are not
[1:36:05] properly taught that's exactly right oh
[1:36:09] she was manifesting a witchcraft friends
[1:36:11] that's childish very very Hallelujah
[1:36:15] before you yes
[1:36:17] sir amen preach it God Hallelujah the
[1:36:23] prophet says and he said how glorious
[1:36:25] would that little branch that escapes
[1:36:28] this isn't the flashing red light uhhuh
[1:36:30] these things it will be Holiness unto
[1:36:32] the Lord amen because remember Enoch we
[1:36:35] said he was dedicated yes sir and he was
[1:36:37] living in Holiness now now remember in
[1:36:41] the in the in the Bible the priests they
[1:36:44] had a
[1:36:45] golden uh they they had a Golden Crown
[1:36:48] right right right I I think I have a
[1:36:50] picture just just it's just a symbolic
[1:36:52] it's not the way it was but just so that
[1:36:55] you'd understand you know God would tell
[1:36:58] them H you know take take take a golden
[1:37:00] plate that's right right and write
[1:37:02] Holiness unto the Lord that's right and
[1:37:04] tie it with a blue cord now you are
[1:37:06] properly taught I'm sure you know these
[1:37:07] things right and the high priest the
[1:37:11] priest would wear this upon his forehead
[1:37:13] that's exactly right because remember
[1:37:15] the Holy Ghost yes also affects your
[1:37:18] forehead because your forehead is a of
[1:37:21] your Revelation that's why the mark of
[1:37:24] the beast the Bible says it's on your
[1:37:25] forehead right what what you are doing
[1:37:28] with your hands right because your
[1:37:30] Revelation affects your life that's
[1:37:32] exactly right right it's a mark you
[1:37:35] receive on your forehead that's right
[1:37:37] but it's also on your hand it's your
[1:37:38] daytoday life and remember also the Holy
[1:37:41] Ghost affects your what because in
[1:37:44] Ezekiel chapter 9 right those that were
[1:37:47] sealed uhhuh the angel with the rightous
[1:37:50] inor sir he was writing something yes
[1:37:53] sir Hallelujah so we also have a writing
[1:37:56] Upon Our foreheads that's right but it's
[1:37:57] a spiritual writing amen amen and the
[1:38:01] priest had a writing that said Holiness
[1:38:03] unto the Lord yes sir and a true
[1:38:06] revelation of Christ that's right brings
[1:38:08] Holiness automatically my friend
[1:38:11] automatically you cannot say oh brother
[1:38:14] we just preached deep things and people
[1:38:15] are living in
[1:38:17] fness the Holy Ghost brings Holiness
[1:38:20] amen holy hly it's a holy walk hlyh
[1:38:25] Hallelujah so Enoch was dedicated unto
[1:38:28] the Lord and we as the Bride As the
[1:38:30] church we also have our vow of the
[1:38:33] Nazarite of Holiness that's right and we
[1:38:36] have Holiness Upon Our forehead like the
[1:38:38] high priest yes my brother yes my
[1:38:42] brother the prophet would somebody would
[1:38:44] come in the prayer line the prophet says
[1:38:45] I feel a welcoming Spirit uhhuh you are
[1:38:48] a Christian that's exactly right because
[1:38:50] they a light around them you may not see
[1:38:53] it but you have a light around you if
[1:38:56] you are a Christian amen amen and the
[1:38:58] prophet will say you're an unbeliever
[1:39:01] there's Darkness around you or you are
[1:39:03] dying there's Darkness you're shattered
[1:39:04] to death right how many knows that yes
[1:39:07] now let me keep R rushing here my time
[1:39:09] is
[1:39:10] running now Enoch had a revelation and
[1:39:13] let's see what Enoch's Revelation was
[1:39:16] the prophet says in the message question
[1:39:17] and answers yes sir says just like the
[1:39:20] pyramid m mhm as Enoch built right so
[1:39:26] Enoch was the servant uhhuh and in know
[1:39:29] the message and he he he put his message
[1:39:34] in a pyramid in a pyramid so Enoch had a
[1:39:38] pyramid
[1:39:40] message Enoch was the seventh and he had
[1:39:43] a pyramid
[1:39:47] [Music]
[1:39:49] message Hallelujah yes so we as the
[1:39:52] Bride As the church we also have a
[1:39:55] pyramid message amen which is the
[1:39:57] Capstone The Headstone right
[1:39:59] amen because Enoch also
[1:40:03] knew that in Blasphemous names right but
[1:40:06] when once you have all these virtues
[1:40:08] then Christ kepts up your virtues with
[1:40:11] Divine love amen how many knows that
[1:40:13] amen the true teaching of of stat of a
[1:40:16] perfect man not the movement the true
[1:40:18] teaching of it friend uhhuh once you
[1:40:21] draw the pyramid some people start
[1:40:23] to preach my
[1:40:26] brother preach my
[1:40:29] brother hallelujah
[1:40:32] amen now we as Saints now the the high
[1:40:35] priest he was given this golden plate
[1:40:39] yes sir but we as the church the prophet
[1:40:41] says that the Bible says that we receive
[1:40:43] a crown of life amen how many knows that
[1:40:47] of course when we get over Yonder we
[1:40:48] receive a crown of life but you cannot
[1:40:51] receive a crown there if you don't have
[1:40:54] a life here because it's a crown of life
[1:40:58] amen amen you got to have a life amen
[1:41:03] because the Bible says in the book of
[1:41:05] Hebrews yes sir that Enoch by faith
[1:41:09] Enoch now the word faith means
[1:41:11] Revelation amen so Enoch had a
[1:41:14] revelation that's right that's why he
[1:41:16] was putting it in a pyramid that's
[1:41:18] exactly right Enoch was preaching the
[1:41:20] pyramid message that's exactly he was
[1:41:22] preaching the second coming of Christ
[1:41:24] exactly and he was preaching judgment
[1:41:26] that's right so Enoch by faith in other
[1:41:29] words by Revelation because faith is a
[1:41:32] revelation that's
[1:41:34] right worked with God Amen and Paul says
[1:41:39] uhhuh for before his translation that's
[1:41:42] right he had the testimony yes my
[1:41:45] brother he had a testimony that's right
[1:41:48] that he pleased God Amen before he
[1:41:50] translation amen he had a what a
[1:41:53] testimony a testimony that he pleased
[1:41:56] God that he pleased God Amen because
[1:41:58] remember we Are Witnesses how many knows
[1:42:00] that yes sir how many knows that we as
[1:42:03] Christians Christ said t in Jerusalem
[1:42:05] from the promise of my father and you
[1:42:08] shall be Witnesses unto me in Judea in
[1:42:11] Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of
[1:42:14] the earth yes sir I'm I apologize I'm
[1:42:16] going very slowly today that's fine cuz
[1:42:19] I want the teaching to sink in my
[1:42:21] brother now for you to be a witness
[1:42:23] right you have to have a testimony
[1:42:25] that's exactly right you cannot be a
[1:42:27] witness without a
[1:42:30] testimony testimony of so before you are
[1:42:33] translated you have to have a testimony
[1:42:36] because Enoch had a testimony that he
[1:42:38] pleased God that's right and without
[1:42:41] faith it is impossible to please God
[1:42:43] that's right and what is faith faith is
[1:42:45] a revelation that's right so inoc it is
[1:42:47] a revelation that pleased God Amen amen
[1:42:51] amen amen amen so we have many people
[1:42:55] today that call themselves Christians go
[1:42:58] ahead now but only a few will please God
[1:43:01] that's exactly because God is looking
[1:43:03] for a specific testimony amen he is
[1:43:06] looking for a specific Revelation that's
[1:43:09] right and it's a pyramid Revelation
[1:43:11] that's right Hallelujah yes my brother
[1:43:14] when we say a pyramid we are not talking
[1:43:16] about just one sermon we're talking
[1:43:18] about the whole message of the hour
[1:43:20] whole message of the hour that's the
[1:43:21] pyramid Christ yes sir yes
[1:43:25] sir yes my brother so
[1:43:29] Enoch had a testimony that he pleased
[1:43:31] God Amen because remember first John
[1:43:33] says that which was from the beginning
[1:43:35] right that which our hands have handled
[1:43:38] which our eyes have seen this is what we
[1:43:40] declare unto you yes sir in other words
[1:43:44] they the testimony that listen we
[1:43:46] handled it we touched it we felt it but
[1:43:50] you know what we are declaring that unto
[1:43:52] you Amen in other words you have no
[1:43:54] right to witness unto Christ unless you
[1:43:56] have met him amen amen because remember
[1:44:00] friends sir I will take you back to
[1:44:03] this okay to bring forth methus as a
[1:44:06] type right and then he had to walk with
[1:44:08] God until he was adopted that's right
[1:44:10] now the Holy Ghost you receive the Holy
[1:44:13] Ghost it quickens the life that is
[1:44:16] already existing in that's exactly right
[1:44:18] but you cannot say well I'm adoped all I
[1:44:21] only just believe and then that's it the
[1:44:25] prophet says that that's a Baptist
[1:44:26] Doctrine how many knows that he says
[1:44:29] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[1:44:32] you believed amen so you have to believe
[1:44:35] God Amen yes the evidence of the Holy
[1:44:38] Ghost is believing the word of your day
[1:44:41] that's right but you for you to that but
[1:44:44] the the faith has to be accepted by God
[1:44:47] that's exactly because the prophet says
[1:44:49] Abraham believed God right and it was
[1:44:52] given to him for righteousness that's
[1:44:54] right but God gave him the sign of
[1:44:56] circumcision to show that he accepted
[1:44:59] his faith that's exactly right because
[1:45:01] you cannot make the scriptures
[1:45:03] contradict one another no sir no sir no
[1:45:07] sir no sir what the prophet says it's
[1:45:09] like someone says I believe Jesus if you
[1:45:11] ask people today how many believe Jesus
[1:45:14] the whole world will say that are they
[1:45:16] saved uhh that's the question today you
[1:45:18] have people who say I believe the
[1:45:20] message do they all have the Holy Ghost
[1:45:22] you have to have the Holy Ghost since
[1:45:25] you believe amen amen amen amen amen
[1:45:29] amen and today we are we are taking the
[1:45:31] Holy Ghost and making it something for
[1:45:32] the Youth Camp yeah the Holy Ghost is
[1:45:35] for the church am it's not for the Youth

[1:46:25] brother my brother and it's not a
[1:46:28] tongue it's not a tongue no a tongue is
[1:46:31] just a gift that's any hypocrite can
[1:46:34] have a tongue that's right the Holy
[1:46:35] Ghost is the Holy Ghost a tongue is a
[1:46:38] tongue these two things are separate
[1:46:40] that's right that's
[1:46:42] [Applause]
[1:46:45] right you can go into a a
[1:46:48] dumpster and find some carets
[1:46:51] but that doesn't mean you found a
[1:46:53] [Music]
[1:46:55] car these things exist in a car but
[1:46:58] doesn't mean that whenever you see a a c
[1:47:01] thrown everywhere you have seen a car no

[1:48:10] can go in the Rapture that's it that's
[1:48:12] it and let's not forget why we are here

[1:50:33] Candlestick when God takes away the
[1:50:36] Candlestick that's he is removing the
[1:50:38] messenger amen you just become a church
[1:50:41] with no Direction because the
[1:50:43] Candlestick has been taken out amen amen

[1:50:56] to the message of the hour and we have
[1:50:58] to come to the main thing to the main
[1:51:00] line that's that's why the prophet says
[1:51:03] stay in line stay in line stay in line
[1:51:06] stay in Hallelujah yes my
[1:51:09] brother where is thy strength going or
[1:51:12] Samson uhhuh and remember when when
[1:51:14] matthus died Bible scholars know this
[1:51:19] you Brothers know this that's when the
[1:51:20] flood came that's right because methus
[1:51:23] lived 969 years and methusa was the
[1:51:27] longest living man that's exactly it was
[1:51:30] showing God's longsuffering that's it
[1:51:33] but you know what scoffers will come
[1:51:35] right say ever since the days of his
[1:51:37] pyramids what came about that ever since
[1:51:40] Enoch's prophecies says the Lord is
[1:51:42] going to come we've been here for all
[1:51:44] these years uhhuh that's why they were
[1:51:46] scoffing Noah that's ex they saying you
[1:51:48] are a son a grandson of of of of of of
[1:51:51] of of Enoch we know you people you are
[1:51:53] branhamites you are
[1:51:56] fanatics but they didn't know that it
[1:51:58] was the longsuffering of God Amen that's
[1:52:01] why methusa lived long amen because Adam
[1:52:05] God was going to send judgment after
[1:52:07] methos because methosa almost lived a
[1:52:10] thousand years ex but God could not
[1:52:13] break his word no sir because it says
[1:52:15] the day that you shall eat you shall die
[1:52:17] and ever since there's no man that has
[1:52:20] lived a thousand years the Millennium is
[1:52:23] when we are for the first time in known
[1:52:25] history Hallelujah we will be living a

[1:53:28] and I don't intend to finish it We Don't
[1:53:31] Preach to
[1:53:34] finish the Bible says and Enoch walked
[1:53:37] with God verse 22 Genesis
[1:53:39] 5:22 and Enoch walked with God after he
[1:53:42] beget Methuselah yes sir 300 years MH
[1:53:46] and
[1:53:48] beget Sons and daugh which means that
[1:53:52] Enoch was working with God Amen but it
[1:53:54] was not something extreme like oh he was
[1:53:58] living in a cave with long beard long
[1:54:01] beard and and bow hair and eating
[1:54:05] vegetables vegetarian he was living a
[1:54:08] normal life friend normal life heaven
[1:54:10] and wife yes sir he was going to
[1:54:12] Chipotle and and
[1:54:13] ordering camole and chips yes sir he had
[1:54:18] Sons and Daughters yes he had a school
[1:54:20] run he had homeschooling he had to go he
[1:54:23] had to go to parents meetings Enoch was
[1:54:26] a normal man when the prophet say oh I'm
[1:54:29] going to be a man of the mountains God
[1:54:31] said you become a bomb in your life your
[1:54:33] wife will leave you how many knows that
[1:54:35] standing in the Gap yes sir the prophet
[1:54:38] says you are called higher higher you
[1:54:40] are like Enoch you're going to live a
[1:54:43] normal life normal life because remember
[1:54:45] friends take your time Hallelujah can I
[1:54:48] have 5 minutes my brother you see when
[1:54:51] when the seals were open the Bible
[1:54:53] became a new book that's exactly right
[1:54:56] it it hit me this week when I you know I
[1:54:58] kept my Bible in in covers right so this
[1:55:01] week I just said let me just take out my
[1:55:04] the covers and you know I've got many
[1:55:05] prayer requests that I just people give
[1:55:07] me and I put them there I pray for them
[1:55:09] put them there you know so I said let me
[1:55:11] just take out my Bible when I took it
[1:55:13] out I said oh it looks beautiful and
[1:55:15] nice it's a new book oh I love my Bible
[1:55:19] what changed is that I took out the
[1:55:21] covers yes my brother so when the
[1:55:23] prophet came go ahead he he he anointed
[1:55:26] our eyes yes sir and the Bible became a
[1:55:29] new book he did not write a new Bible no
[1:55:33] sir he took the covers from our eyes by
[1:55:36] giving us I house that's it that's
[1:55:41] it so Enoch lived a man a life like a
[1:55:45] man with sons and daughters which means
[1:55:48] that for him to have sons and daughters
[1:55:50] he had a
[1:55:52] wife and he would have time with his
[1:55:55] wife amen amen so so people say Walking
[1:55:59] with God makes you extreme
[1:56:02] no how would why would he have sons and
[1:56:05] daughters if he was not having time with
[1:56:07] his family friends read between the
[1:56:10] light he was living a normal life
[1:56:14] brother normal some people become
[1:56:16] extreme when they come to the message of

[2:00:32] Bram because the woman want the man to
[2:00:35] to to joke with her and all this kind of
[2:00:37] stuff and he was complaining to brother

[2:01:07] remaining how can brother BR make a
[2:01:09] statement that okay if I tell you that
[2:01:15] in two
[2:01:16] hours Jesus is coming and it's true some
[2:01:20] will begin to call their boss and say
[2:01:25] bye-bye I won't come tomorrow I
[2:01:27] quit some will say
[2:01:30] that if you have to work tonight 12:00
[2:01:33] p.m. you would say I won come because
[2:01:35] Jesus is coming but brother brandham say
[2:01:37] if I
[2:01:39] know that Jesus is coming do you follow
[2:01:42] me he will go and prepare the sermon to
[2:01:47] preach no knowing that Jesus is coming
[2:01:50] why do you prepare the sermon if Jesus
[2:01:52] is
[2:01:53] coming that's why this message please
[2:01:56] friend when you read the prophet be very
[2:02:00] careful we made brother Branham speak
[2:02:02] things he didn't
[2:02:04] speak because we didn't sit down under
[2:02:07] the anointing of the spirit and pray to
[2:02:09] get really what is the spirit trying to
[2:02:13] say by this messenger what is brother
[2:02:15] brandham trying to talk really amen am
[2:02:18] why because you continue to live a
[2:02:21] Christian life but the main focus is the
[2:02:25] rapture but even though we looking at
[2:02:27] the rapture we got to put the kids in
[2:02:29] bed we got to do this we got to go to
[2:02:31] work and be good citizen and be good to

[2:02:37] is whenever the trumpet s the Jubilee
[2:02:40] trumpet what do you have to do you drop
[2:02:42] whatever you doing and you go so if the
[2:02:45] Rapture catches you at work you're not
