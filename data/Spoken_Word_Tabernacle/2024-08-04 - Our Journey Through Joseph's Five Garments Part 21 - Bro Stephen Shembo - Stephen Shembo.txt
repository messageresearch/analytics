load you with qu about amen yeah so just say amen and everything worked out amen you say Amen to the word of God not to brother Steven amen should be a good thing H the name of God is amen one of the name of God Amen and what we trying to do is to help you because brother Bram did it with the young man I gave you a quote here before brother Bram took the young man and spoke with them about sex he took the young sisters and did it and spoke with it and there was no problem at all amen but sometime we wonder why why why no problem there's no problem but we would let the prophet talk brother Bram says this ah glory to God in the message communion brother Bram was uh talking and explaining about communion and he says now reason I'm saying this it's all right brother Perry and brother Perry green answered sure he said that the reason I'm saying this so that you would understand what you are doing so brother Bram was explaining communion and he begin to explain it and he says the reason why he is explaining all of this so you understand what you are doing amen then brother BR made a statement this was given to me at Night by the Lord Brother Branda made a statement he say if you walk into anything how blindly anything means anything amen this Pulpit is anything this church is anything your marriage is anything can you say amen amen can you say Amen brother Bram say if you walk into anything how blindly ah now you're responding praise God you don't know where and what you are doing don't don't look at me say Amen to the word brother Bram say if you walk into anything how blindly you don't know what where and what you are what doing you can't even have confidence if you don't know what you're doing how do you know you know what you're doing glory to God don't worry my friend he says but you must do what understand what you are doing and why you doing it we must understand why do we get married oh we just get married because everybody get married amen oh two people get married two people make married push the break why do we get married why should I leave my mother my mother is cooking for me she's nice with me she's taking care of me she does everything for me why should I leave my mama why should I leave my father and go leave with you why I must know what I'm doing because if I get blindly brother Bram say you won't even have confidence amen you got to know what you doing and why you doing it amen why are we doing what we doing are we together are we together are we together this is why we brought religion in the message that's it right there why we don't wear hearing why why why you got to prove it to me why why we don't wear hearing no we don't wear heing because mama said no so the day I get off from mama I put hearing because I never understood why why why women don't wear pant no because somebody say don't wear pant that's the problem in the message and the people are under the prison for lack of Revelation you need to know why you doing it why should I believe this message and not any other message the day you understand that that's it you will be confident in the message and nobody will move you from the message even if everybody leave the message I know what I'm doing in the message I know why I'm believing the message I know why I'm standing for the message I know what I'm doing in this message I know where the message is going to take me to there was a church back home that had a piano player the piano player was the only one in the church so he played piano according to his own way the same song and one day there was a brother that came from another church who was a myestro in the piano when the brother came he asked for for uh uh what do you call it like uh special song and they put him on the piano he was still the same piano but when the brother touched the piano the whole church got a different sound like every day we never hear that piano play like that because somebody knew what they were doing you might have that instrument for a long time but you don't know what you're doing the day you will know what you're doing you will begin to receive different [Applause] SS are we together my people suffer for what lack of knowledge God bless you spoken word let's stand and read the word I was sitting meditating and this court came boom and say my God blessed be the name of the Lord amen when a quot come from Brother Bram I'm already free because the message is already Vindicated amen amen you got from the world drinking smoking come back we put you in the [Music] water come out from the water we call you brother and we take a nice sister come on now brother and we say that's your wife go ahead and get married it's better for them to marry it's better to better to marry good luck blindly correct amen you don't know what you're doing preach brother amen amen my subject this morning is our life journey through Joseph 5 garment part 21 I will try to give you the theme by God's grace let's go to our scripture this morning Judges chapter 6 Oh Glory to God Amen you can read this message and it doesn't do anything to you and if somebody else come and read it for you you wonder is that the same is the same book because now you begin to know what is going on the very content of the message amen amen amen if not we get somewhere in despair that's right say this is what was marriage so why why are they [Music] shouting that's all that's all that's it no that's not all the Bible says who found a wife found what good thing so a wife is what a good thing so why is your wife not a good [Applause] thing can you say amen amen what is wrong did God lie we make God look like a liar but his word is always true where is that good wife you hear that Judges chapter 6 glory to God the Bible says in verse one you know the story very well and the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord and the Lord delivered them into the hand of Midian how many years seven years you might be seated so do we expect the Deliverance in the first year no in the second year no in the third year no in the fourth no no in the fifth no in the sixth no in the seven yes Deliverance in the seven years praise God verse two and the Hand of Midian let's go back in verse one he says and the Lord delivered them into the hand of who median pray is God amen amen he says verse two and the Hand of Midian prevailed against Israel and because of the medanite the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains and caves and what strongholds so this oppression develop a new lifestyle correct he was not there before they were not living in the caves or in the den or in the mountain but because of the oppression they develop a second lifestyle and that lifestyle became normal that's how we live when you work you go to the mountain and you hide stuff that's how we live and amen amen amen even if you forget somebody will remind you hey remember we need to go to the mountain and to the caves right remember amen and so it was when Israel had sown that the midianite came up and The Who Am malachit stop did God deliver Israel in the hand of the amalik sir he delivered them in the hand of what medanite but why is the amalik coming certain demon are not single they go in P you begin to play around with women poverty will hit you that's what the Bible say and then lying spirit will come because you got a lie to cover up what you're doing so it's not one demon it's one that started but he he goes in the combo are we together are we together the Bible say he was Midian but now it's no longer Midian Midian doesn't come along when he comes he bring am malachite come on Amen the Bible says and so it was when Israel head soon that the medanite came up and the what amalekites come and the what the children of the everybody's coming up amen even they came up against them and they encamp against them and did what destroyed the increase of the earth until you come to Gaza and left no no sust sustainance sustenance for Israel neither sheep nor a ox nor what they destroy everything they only come when the paycheck comes when there is no paycheck they out because dare you suffering when the direct deposit come when they come that's a better way to make you understand amen and they begin to take everything until you overdraft then they leave you then they're waiting for the next paycheck amen amen verse five for they came up with their cattle and their tents and they came as what grasshoppers for what multitude for both they and their camel were without number and they enter into the land to do what destroy it what a great Army if you start counting them they don't have a number correct you're going to run out of the number that's right coming against Israel how can we take care of this situation are we together verse 6 and Israel was greatly impoverished not just impoverished greatly in other words they really handle Israel greatly impoverished because of the medanite but they were not alone it was the amalik and the children of the East because of the median and the children of Israel cried to the Lord amen an enemy without number an enemy that have other enemy that are coming against you amen now job to verse 11 the Bible says and there came an angel of the Lord and sat under an oak which was in offra that pertained to joash the abizer and his son Gideon Tres weat by the winepr to hide it from the median become a custom a way of living you get used to something that is bad but you just get used to it it's the normal way of life that's how people live if you want to make a living that's what you have to do you work you go hide it somewhere if you don't hide something bad will happen to you amen because sometime when years take too long we develop complexes that's it of a bad situation right amen amen until it's very hard to get somebody out of it are we together are we together you get used to it so much until when they come and they show you this is the right thing you begin to have a hard time accepting what is right that's right because of the way denomination or handle you for a long time amen amen amen the Pharisees so indoctrinated Israel until when Jesus come now Jesus is having a hard time there is no way for God to even break through and convince his people that I am the one that they were preaching because you came with a different tune we already got used to this tonee yours is strength John the Baptist what's wrong taking people draing them into the water where are you coming from with this kind of stuff who did this in the past where do you bring this new doctrine amen amen sometime Deliverance is not easy amen you got to bump against a lot of walls to get people people out brother Bram spoke about Johnny the crow he was tired for so long until his state became a way of living to the point that when they cut even the the the what uh the tag he cannot even fly even if you tell him you lose is's still there because he got used so much at the beginning he was trying fighting trying to get up after a while he get tired because there is a situation you fought for a long time trying to resolve it's not giving you a good answer then you begin to cooperate you begin to manage yourself you begin to transform yourself to accept that situation as a normal situation and you Incorporated that situation in your life and you begin to live like that praising God with a tie in a boot and they say Johnny let's praise the Lord he praised the Lord until his time remand him stop right there and when they cut the tie he remember the boundaries that they tie already determined in his life even though there is no tie he still think he have a tie we need to lose you my [Applause] friend those legalistic stuff in the message when got to lose you amen got to break you lose amen where you can be free to worship God Amen free to praise God free to clap hand amen free to jump for God Amen amen free to dance for the Lord amen ah glory to God where are we at my friend you know what let's just pray because it looks like the airplane is moving Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly this morning Father we thank you for your grace for your love for your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father we are committing this service unto th hand may you move us completely out of the way Lord may you come and be the one speaking and the one hearing and interpreting your word we rebuke every demonic spirit away from this place may only the Holy Spirit have a preeminence in this service may you bless us Lord and be with us in the name of Jesus Christ amen am amen so over time we develop complexes we develop second nature we think that's the way things should be and we okay with it have you seen somebody who fell and broke his leg have you seen it before if you try to straighten up their legs what do they do ah Don't touch don't touch leave it like that yes sir sir because trying to put the leg back to the normal it's now a problem but what you have is a crooked leged so I don't have any choice I got to get you some anesthetic and tomorrow you will be happy amen amen now Midian was oppressing Israel Gideon here preparing the wheat to go hide it verse 12 and the angel of the Lord which is the Lord himself did what said unto him no appeared to him verse 12 and say to him the Lord is with you that's right amen thank you Lord you Gideon son of Jo yes yes sir we talking about Gideon when the Lord appear he look at Gideon he said the Lord is with you you Gideon read your Bible can we read together can we read together there was a Gideon that was coward a Gideon dagger used to be hiding stuff a Gideon that he moral his Spirit his mind was already oppressed by the enemy until he never thought he can be somebody that's it am but when God come he doesn't even call him Gideon sir because gide is associated with all the failure when you say brother Steven somebody will remember when I was preaching someone else will remember when I was hard on them somebody will remember when I fired them everybody okay because the name is associated with a lifestyle so when God is coming to Gideon he doesn't call his name but he called Gideon by a name are we together sir are we together are we together yes sir God is saying verse 12 and the angel of the Lord appeared to him and say to him the Lord is what with thee you Gideon you what Mighty Man of Valor he doesn't even mention his name so he's coming in a situation of a man depressed that's right a man that is under bondage a man that is under fear a man that is even preparing stuff to go hide and God look at that man and say the Lord is with you am am am am when you were hiding your stuff the Lord is with you when you were trembling the Lord is with you and God look at him how he's hiding stuff he say you mdy man of Valor who says the truth God or man the Bible say let every word of a man be alive now God is looking at a coward man and he's telling the coward you Mar man of B who is God talking to in other word the might man of Valor was in

so God was a Awakening who in Gideon because when God wake up he doesn't have a limit that's why God say go with the might that you have where did you get that M Hallelujah jum to verse six my friend he says I have said that you are what we already understand this now right you don't tell your children you my children they already know they your children so if you begin to tell them you my children it's a child Maybe that was raised by your uncle then you got to recuperate the child and reprogram the child to explain the child that truly your uncle that you call Papa is not your uncle I am your papa so there is an identity crisis right here with the children of God so that God have to train them back again that ye are Gods amen and all of you are what children of what why does God I mean God with his child and God is telling his child that you are the a child of the most high why let me put it together this way brother Charles Hamilton is talking to Elijah and he's telling Elijah you are the child of Charles ham Hamilton Jr why why so those children don't know stuff amen amen what caused their Amnesia what put them in that state that when they see God they don't know their relationship to the being that they looking at something must have happened to these children until God have to remind them or God have to awaken them to the fact that they are his children and they are God what happened to these children what caus it verse seven but you shall do it die like men these children according to verse six God say they are gods in verse six God declared them as gods and God declared them as children amen of the most high I have to read the Bible slowly like this so you can grasp it amen then in verse seven we found out that the Bible say they would die like men are we together in other word these gods are men if I lost you you tell me if I lost you raise your hand thank you mama let me start it again in verse six God look at his children he said you are God and all of you are children of the most high amen something must happen for God to have a a meeting with his children to tell them that uh today meetings is about telling you who you are all of you are gods and all of you are children of the most high maybe the children of maybe those Gods can look each other they say we already know we're God so what's problem with this no God now unveil in verse S he say you will die like men amen amen in other words these Gods amen am men they are men they are human being amen subject to death amen if you have a hard time understanding what I'm saying in Genesis 1:26 when God created men he created him in his own what in his own what brother Bram say his whole F was God even his intelligence was like God Amen and God put those children in the Garden of Eden and God tell tell them eat everything now we begin to S but there is one thing do not touch if you touch it you will die a God that die is a god that is human are we together are we together Adam was God but Adam was subject to death right if they do something that is contrary to what God told them amen so this subject God is telling them you are a human being you are dying in other word this prophecy concern the sons of God God after the [Applause] fall because before fall the gods were not dying Adam was not dying Adam was not getting sick Adam could not fall and break his leg but when death was introduced now Adam may die and God said that remember you are God even though you die like men so it's a prophecy that came after the fall because after the fall the children of God lost their identity are we together and then they are subject to death and as they dying they think they are mortal come on brother amen amen amen then God is coming he say hey don't pay attention to the Grave even though you get sick you are [Applause] God even though you might have a little back pain remember you are a child of the most high God in other words don't let your Humanity blur your godship I don't know if we are together don't let your senses take over who you are don't let your family status poor in man take over the M man of Valor don't let your status the list off the family take over M man of Val remember it is time for M man of it is no long a time for the poor in the family the bad person in the neighborhood the one that was rap in the past taken advantage by my uncle forget about that one remember you are [Applause] God you are a child of the most high God because the devil will always point you to that one and as long as he keep your attention there he keep you

and God is telling me them I know you got an enemy yes and that enemy frighten you so much his name is death but remember even though you going through death amen amen remember you are God now let's see what happened to the true God the Lord Jesus Christ Hebrew chapter 2 because here God is telling his children let's look at God himself amen Hebrews 2:5 if you there you can say amen for to the angel has he not put in subjection the world to come in other word the future world will not be ruled by Angel it is for God Amen but we know the Throne of God is not for God himself I I already gave you the scripture amen so the word to come belong to somebody in other word God is telling the angel there is none of you here that I have reserved the right to take care of the future world are we together are we together if you respond we're moving my friend yeah because if you don't I'm giving you time so the material is soaking in because some we got to pack pack pack pack and give some space for the next one amen word he said for the angel for to the angel he has not put in what the world to come whereof we do what but one in a certain place that was David testify saying what is man that you are mindful of him or the son of man that you do what it is man and being mindful of man and visiting the son of man that's right that's right amen verse seven you made him a little what lower than the Angels stop the angels are not given the right to rule yes sir amen it means that this person here is above the angel he's here that person let's call him person one and Below him they are angels amen so he's the top person over there amen now when God begin to manufacture this person amen he begin to make him a little lower than the angel yeah God but you are dying like what Angel dies are we together are we together are we together all right let's go now he says you made him how a little lower than what so when this person they finish him amen amen amen when he become one let me call him B one below amen the angel now are on top of him right over here follow me carefully when he walk the angel does this all the angel back up because he's above of them but now he's made a little lower than what so now if an angel come to him he's frightened he trembles open the door why you why you why are you running away I saw a light over there I don't know if you getting me please put your seat belt so we can clam good I don't know if you're getting what I'm saying amen this man when he was here amen when the angel are coming to him they even put their wings like this say most high most high he said what do you want who are you I am Gabriel amen even the Carib have to fold their knees fold their body and fold even their just and and you know by the way they are in his presence but they cannot look at him they have to keep singing Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy amen but this person here amen when they made him a little lower than the angel he's singing Holy are you God and and and her face is looking like this and his face is looking like this they don't cover their faces [Music] [Applause] were you in church this morning did you see them singing Holy are we God [Music] Almighty are we together are we together are we together but because they were made lower than the angel they are afraid of angels when they pray they're praying they're praying they're

little than what are we together are we together let's go now and you made him a little what lower than the angel and you did what crown him with what glory and what and honor and did set him over the what the works of thy hands follow me carefully I didn't plan none of this amen when God manufactur this person and made this person a little lower than the angel amen amen God didn't make his identity lower than the angel even though he was lower than the Angel God still crown him with glory and with honor and God give him the responsibility of everything that is over the Earth so if you look at him he's lower than the angel but if you try to touch him you will hear [Applause] God let me help somebody if you look at him you will see him lower than the angel you will see him lausus friend I remember when we went to Burger King and if you get caught up with him too much you will see him after while he say hey remove the son remove the son because he was crowned with glory and

made so who created everything God God who word clear John 1:14 easy and the Word was made flesh the word was made flesh this word flesh means human it means man this word made means Beth Amen in other words the word made flesh the word become FLH they Untouchable becomes touchable are we together they visible became visible God became human God became are we together God became human God became man that's what he means Paul uh John say and the Word was made what flesh and did what dwelt among us and we behad the what his glory so when Jes so when people were looking at Jesus was Jesus shining that was the glory amen so what is the glory of God you thinking you look at him like this it's a glory of God so when they say Glory you look in at but they say we beheld the glory of God can you see his glory look at me where I am now can't you see his glory what Glory are you looking at me shining hold on my friend he said we beheld his what Glory the glory as the only begotten of what the father full of grace and truth so when they say where is the glory of God they say he's right yes God this is the glory of God but he has a beer he he's human yeah that's the glory of God full of grace so where is the grace bring a woman caught in adultery you will see his grace all he does he step on and begin to write with his finger that's right that's right is this the gra yes that's the grace of God so God became human amen God was made flesh and that was the glory of God Amen so where is the problem this is the problem I go back here one thought two word amen three flesh amen this flesh is called human it's called man this one is called God Jesus did this touch word Word Flesh Jesus Is God God became man God became human amen God became flesh the word became flesh we clear on that amen everybody will say amen amen but the problem that God is saying to his children that year God all of you children of the most high but you shall die like men is because something happened to

move from thoughts follow me to what flesh and and we bypass One Step which is what the word or which is what let me go back again so somebody get a sink me and you left the thought of God and drop into the flesh so you don't know who you are do you follow me the step that we skip is the step of the word but this word is God in other word we skip the step of [Music] God Amen are we together in the case of Jesus he was the word made flesh oh God becoming human oh God be coming amen but in our case it's now becoming flesh becoming [Applause] God human becoming man [Music] becoming and the devil doesn't want you to do this because everything was created by this one if you want to create you got to go back here let's go back again in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was what God all things were made by who him and there is nothing that was created that was created by who by him amen so this level here amen is where creation is are we together and we

father for which one of those work do you water in other word I did many you never ston me so from all the miracle I did which Miracle upset you to be to the point that you want to kill me what is really upsetting you to be to the point that you you you are determined that let take off his life amen amen amen the Jews es for him saying for what good work we Stone thee not so the devil can tolerate your [Applause] [Music] Miracle can you say amen amen but for what for blasphemy and because thou being what a man make thyself God when you being a what amen if you make yourself God that one the devil do like why do why is the devil hating that amen he said Jesus answered them is not is it not written inw I said ye are what God if you call them Gods unto whom the word of God came and the scripture cannot be broken say ye of him whom the father have Sanctified and send into the word that Blasphemous because I said I am the Son of God brother give me more clarity on this scripture brother Bram tell me brother Bram say you ready my friend let's go for Healing The Sick for preaching the gospel for making the blind to receive their sight or perceiving their thought in uh in the in the audience when the woman touch water my garment and I could not tell who he was and look around and the father let me know what her trouble was and she was what heal do you Stone me for that do you Stone me for the vision that I saw when I did what looked over the audience and perceived the thought which of those wordss do you sto me for brother Bram say now listen brother Bram says what now listen he say now listen and they answer him and say for not these good works but because that did what blashe now that's the reason being a man you make yourself God now watch watch what the principle is what God in the people how could God being what supernatural being this man how can the great God be this man this woman God ah come on man come on man huh he say they never heard of that what before but Jesus was what opening a g a what a door to to the race of what of Adam being what being the son of God [Applause] so when Jesus Christ begin to tell human being that me and my father

the gate and say come out my [Applause] friend oh God he says the Pentecostal has received what the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that makes them a part of what Fellowship in relationship with God that is what that's born again and a son and a what daughter of God tell them out that the Bible and they shall do what believe it but they think of it is they forgot what who they are they think think well I don't know oh brother you that is what born again you are what Sons and Daughters of God how co-equal with Jesus Christ in his presence you are co-equal with Jesus Christ in his presence that's why he's not ashamed to call you brother that's why we are joined her that's why King aerus could th Esther up to the of my kingdom not the fullness the half because he got to keep a half and another half oh my that is what make the devilry it is to let the church realize who they are oh you great church you great Living Church of the Living God you who claim to have done what kiss the blessings off of the rim of the cup sometime I wonder if if God could ever take this gospel and Shake you to a place until you realize who you are and the right that you have and God giv what privileges shake you shake [Applause] you so that you understand you are God [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah he does not lay in the individual he lays where in God he didn't lay in Christ Jesus he

today he lays within God it is not you it's God in [Applause] you let me stop here my friend let me stop here my friend brother Bram says that same power that same Christ Hallelujah let the fundamentalist let them people who deny the power of God say it is wrong but that same power that did what spoke the world into existence is in those people that got what the Holy Ghost that's right

you what in other word my light my light why did you go but in the resurrection morning that light came [Applause] back and enter into Jesus and took Jesus to heaven and dropped Jesus in heaven and the light unzip Jesus and came out of Jesus and ziped Jesus and left him on the throne and come on [Applause] Pentecost and when the light came on Pentecost he counted the audience 120 and the light begin to chop 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 120 he finishes the light continue he said where is Paul and the same light that was whisper is Vindicated with [Applause] malach the pillar of fire returning to the church to make the human becomes God let's stand my [Applause] friend Mighty Man of Val Mighty Man of H the pillar of Fire thank you Lord because that word is the pillar of [Music] fire if he finishes on the day of Pentecost how did Paul see him because he's a f without limit an exhaust Fountain of water he's the bread that can cut and keep bullying bread until they F until the children are filled the
