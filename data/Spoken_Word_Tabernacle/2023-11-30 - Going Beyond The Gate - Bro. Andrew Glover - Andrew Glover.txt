everyone got to go there amen but you cannot stay there because there's more to the journey than just justification or sanctification but there's a baptism of a holy ghost but let me go and say it you can't even stay there amen there's more to the believer there's a there there is the word itself come on lot was the time for the Lorn believer but Abraham wasn't because he was air Amen to lot was Lot was air to a lukor condition that Abraham was air to everything that God had given him in the Covenant let me just say it to you tonight Church there's a bride on the earth tonight and denomination has gone as far as they can go they have settled down with tradition they have settled down with dogness and settle down but just having church services amen but there's a bride on the earth tonight who is a Seed of Abraham and she's not anointed just to go to the gates she is Anointed to go to the door and to go through the door because she's an air to all F theet of God establishes what lot was he was a type of a luk forign Believer again 1959 he said as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the coming of the son of man he said now does your spirit deser this right remember lot was a type of America now lot is a type of the Lorn believer he's also a type of America so a Lorn believer can only go so far and America can only go so far he said it's proven it what was the sin of Sodom it was perversion in this American country of ours the women has degraded themselves so much until natural men sources has been perverted and so now we have a lot as a type of the lukor believer right yes sir we have as a type of America 1964 the prophet of God says he been down there in Sodom we've seen what taking place he said now there was Lot a type of the church natural am been down in Sodom the organization so now we have him as the Lorn believer as a type of America and now as a type of the organization amen he said but they got a messenger down there he said that was a Billy Graham and or Roberts now don't forget this that Billy Graham could only take his people so calm Billy Billy Graham did a good job at preaching repentance he preached the salvation but he can only take him so far and then there was an Oral Roberts that would move him from Billy Graham's time am into the Pentecostal seed but there was more to it than just the Pentecostal seed and then but there was a word seed that had to be sold into the heart of the Bride he said see lot one of the world Amen so God tore up his world and separated Abraham and lot he said and lot being type again of a carinal Believer amen he's a Lor believer he's a type of America he's a type of the organization he's a type of a carnal believer who didn't think these things were true so he just went on down in the sorrow and then lot did not believe the things that Abraham was talking about so he settled for Sodom amen and he didn't have the real spunk to stand out amen and call what was right right and what was wrong wrong can I sit to you like this God does not want MI amen God wants separators Abraham was a separator amen lot was a mixer that's why lot amen could go into Sodom and could be happy with the conditions of Sodom that it fed Abraham and then because he knew he was more and then he knew he was air to more than what Sodom had let me just tell you Bri I tell you why you cannot get satisfied in way I see tell why this world is not satisfied hunger of your soul it's because we are citizens of another C we are seeking a city foundations the C is the maker of the dev let me said f as I know how we will not back up we will not lay down and we will not be satisfied with temporary conditions when there's a Perfection our there a the L but something Beyond this convention and call to the Bride of Jesus Christ come up high come on up high up of the America come up out of lukew condition come up out of carnality God called Abraham Amen to a total separation because God requires amen a complete separation from the world yes sir God requires a complete separation from the world now can I can I share something with you tonight and then don't forget this okay sometimes advancement requires separation that's right yes sometimes requires separation don't just suggest it no sir it's not a recommendation no sir it's not an option it's a requirement yes sir said no matter what the world says they still want bow to the Modern Trend of modern religion no social gospel for them men some that still believe God's holy they believe he requires Holiness he requires the new birth and he requires a separation from sin that is not a suggestion my friend that is a requirement that's a holy God that requires Holiness he requires a new birth and he requires a separation from sin when you separate can I say this when you separate you are separating from something amen amen to go into something you are separating from something to something so you're not just separating yourself to be Idol and standing alone but you're separating yourself because there's a higher call there a higher calling upon your life and I tell you what for the devil wants to put a pressure on message people say well you all are just trying to be something you're just trying to preach something deep and you're just trying to be some revelated something no you don't understand we're not lck where Abraham a city and our name and we can St here and the only way to get there is by Revelation so we're willing to separate from everything contrary to God's word to walk in the provisions of jeah when you separate you separate from something Amen to something don't ever forget that I'm I'm laying some Foundation advancement requires separation and when you separate you separate from something to something said the first man separated himself he said that was Adam and he separated himself from the word to go with his wife so Adam left the word to follow his wife that question whether God kept his word or not he said what a perfect type of the lukor carnal minded believer today that still wants to clean with that their tradition says instead of taking what the word says and then there's your problem tradition the of the word stand with tradition he said he was separated to his wife he said and the carnal believer is separated amen from the word to the church the caral believer is separated from the word to the church the genuine believer Abraham believer is separated from the church to the word preach for seal I'm no longer going to call you church I'm call you CH no going to call you church I'm going to call you bride so that you will understand listen your name is not miss church your name is not miss your name is Jesus Christ is Jesus Christ the prophet said that the name of God interpreted is the manifestation of the name of God we have not been separated we been from the word to the church we have been separated from the church to the word the church lives by tradition but the bride lives by Revelation separation said always the word requires total and complete separation every one of us here tonight we're on a journey right amen and there are steps in our journey amen we are on a journey of grow can I say that we're on a journey of growth as long as we are here amen we are growing in Christ there is always room to grow that's why you need the revelation of this message spoken over your life on a continual basis is because you're in a journey and you got to grow into the fullness of what God has called you to be now you all know that the natural types the spiritual right and then there's a natural human journey and there's a spiritual journey and the natural human Journey began in your life when you was born amen as an infant and then you grew into a baby and then you grew into a toddler and then you grew into a child and then you grew into a preeing and then you grew into a teenager then you grew into an adult then you grew into an elder see there's a journey and you don't stop growing because there's a fullness that you're headed to Paul says in Ephesians 4:13 he says do we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God to a perfect man but to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ watch what Paul says that we henceforth be no more children listen friends you you cannot be born and Skip childhood you got to go to childhood but you can't stay in childhood a calling you to it am let me be no more children toss to and fro yes sir carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the Slate of men and CUNY craftiness whereby they lie and waight to deceive amen but speaking the truth and love Paul says that we may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ then don't you ever forget church that God sent a prophet in the AG to preach a sermon called the stature of a perfect man and he built a pyramid and at the bottom of the pyramid it was really wide there was a lot of room but the closer you got to the Capstone the more narrow the pyramid become because the only thing that go can go to H you is perfection PA said amen L not again the foundation of dead work water baptism and repentance under God let us go all un of perfection still not preaching tonight I want to announce to America I want to announce to I want to announce to the organization I want to announce to the caral Believers there is an abrahamic PR who knows she is a to all things that God has is hers she will not lay down she will not quit growing and she will not back up because she knows her potential is in Jesus Christ amen that we may grow look at this word grow it means to cause to grow it means to augment it means to increase to become greater I love what the brother says Born Again Christians amen grow into the stature of Christ as they live they're born again and their lives begin to shape like a baby that's right there it takes form and begins to grow the first thing you know here they are in the full stature amen there you are day after day year after year they stay the same see now they come back to the word and he shows you the place of growth is in the word he say if you abide in me and my words abide in you he said you cannot expect a baby to be born to man it's got to grow to it and we grow in Christ to the full stature not somebody get converted tonight and tomorrow preach the gospel but we grow up somebody say grow up we grow up into manhood into the stature of Christ see that's why Pentecostal babies even could not take this message it was told Beyond a birth it was moving into adoption it was moving beyond gifts it was moving beyond ttimes it was moving beyond emotion it was bringing a stability come on Paul said I ain't got time to teach all this I got to preach it Paul said amen that we be not children talk to and fro with every wind of Doctrine don't get mad at me but somebody that follows every new doctrine that comes around the message is not a manifested son there still a child there still an in there's still a baby what they need to do is settle down somewhere the word of God begin to cause him to come to stability in the message of the hour and we're always talking about how bad the world's getting right but the God said while we're talking about how bad the world is getting he said we're forgetting how powerful the church is at the same time at the same time the world is getting worse the bribe is getting stronger like this he said the church is growing each age is aot in the scripture come through the Holy Spirit Reveals His word by manifesting it and vindicating it his s showing it's his word being brought to pass in the day it's been promised to be brought to pass in listen God is not bringing Noah's promised to pass because this is not Noah's day he's not bringing Moses has promised to pass this is not Moses's day but he's bringing the promise of eloh to this generation it's the age that Elohim will return to the church for the manifestation I preacher watch the manifestation of the word of God is the Vindication that it is the word that's right don't you ever forget that if God's word is God's word and manifested the same one that manifested is the same one that'll vindicate it prove it to you in Genesis 1 he said let there be light let there be light he spoke his word and said let there be light he said then there was light he said see had there been no light then we would have automatically known that it was not God's word that's right he would automatically known that it was not God's word but because there was l was the vation the manifestation of the word of God I heard Prophet say let there be a bride let be a messiah be Prophet say let there be a squirrel give me your two sons because the two sons was because the squir was there call the CR is here have an incredible God day we're not looking for the word but we are looking at you are the indication and the manifestation of the spoken word of God in age that you're living in I'm want to say this plain as I know how God is going to have a mature bride yes hell won't stop won stop unbeliever won stop stop stop it's going to be [Music] ad we withy in this age yes I believe as the prophet said we have been children long enough God is going to turn his church into manhood now yes we've been babies long enough we been having be t on the back long don't get mad at me but it's time to grow up I said it's time to grow up on church it's time to grow up we ought to be be shoes we be makeup be we be we be we run off we all this N I know you don't watch it but I we give it's time to grow up it's time to move on it's time to come to [Applause] stability God said we play and we have thr it as children but now we're going to have to put away childish things and take on manhood which is maturity that's where lot could not go he could not go to maturity he can not go to responsibility he can not go to manhood he stayed inside but there was an Abraham was air to the world he was going all the way if he had to struggle he would struggle if he had to pray he would pray what had to do he was willing to do it because he was anointed to go all the way now can I take two minutes can I take two minutes and break down to you real easy the difference in childhood and manhood go ahead my brother take your time childhood is a kid that wakes up on Thursday morning and they got a scratchy throat and they got a little cough and they don't feel the greatest so they go in the in the living room and they say mom they say Mom I don't feel like going to school m says okay just go back to bed see there's no responsibility what he going to miss a test recess lunch there's no responsibility you take a man that's right that wakes up with the scratching FL and a bad headache he still goes to work you know why because there's a responsibility car yes when responsibility it separates the childhood from a man running from the presence of God because in the presence of God is where man finds responsibility prophets that were always prone Amen to serve responsibility but you know what I say I say what a prophet said we' been babies long enough go right but come on we might as well preach and we might bring that right on in church and then we wake up on Sunday morning and break a fingernail and the car won't start we go back in the house and we'll say well I guess it just God's will for me to go to church today you spiritual baby that's right you spiritual baby I'm an of a spiritual baby and a son of God you let a Son of God wake up on Sunday morning and the car won't start he'll start calling people and he'll start walking the church he knows there a responsibility has L up his life to come to the St HEB over for said we play his children long enough he said when I was a child I spake as a child because he f as a child amen but now it's time we begin to think like men and women should for we got to get down to this I believe I believe in the spiritual growth of the believer I believe what Peter said when he said we desire as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that she may grow thereby yes sir said you know the Holy Spirit feeds on the word that's exactly man shall not live by bread alone word that proceed out of the mouth of God you just take each day not as just a routine but I'd say just to make that your heart crav for just to sit down each day and read so much out of your Bible you would be surprised what it would do for your spiritual growth devil pushing back against me I'm too busy I'm too busy well if you got time for ESPN you got time for soccer and football if you got time for everything but the house of God your problem is not having time you're telling us where your heart is your heart whatever your Treasures are there is your heart also this may not be what you want to hear but I on my heart get some around this message to be [Music] again time some fathers to start doing the praying instead the mama to do all get some fathers go to the house of God M was beging seeit condition St the grow of the church I ain't got time for prayer time but you got time to keep up with everything in the world you got time for ESPN you got time for the message of the got remember we got to grow up and realize bun of babies play in church we're Sons and Daughters of God am am God desires spiritual growth in his church amen more than he does natural growth now don't get mad at me but God is more pleased with spiritual grow is natural grow because he walked off and left the BST who was hollowing a million more in 44 and come to a VI that was Abraham's time and the promises of the now I'm going to say it to his as I know how go ahead Israel's Journey had stages Israel in Egypt Israel in the wilderness Israel in the promise land Israel in the homelands look at Deuteronomy 2 verse1 it said we turned and took our journey into the Wilderness by the way of the Red Sea that's right the Lord spake unto me and said we've compassed this m many days and the Lord spake unto me saying he have compassed this mountain long enough turn [Music] you it's time to turn on Church in other words be on this mountain more to your this m more to your journey saying the Red Sea was a part of their Journey but Sten they had to go there but they couldn't stay there that's right they had to go to G but they couldn't stay there they had to go to the Wilderness but they couldn't stay there it was ordained to go to the promised land but the was C now think about this Israel was on a journey and brother said by automobile they would have been there in tre in an hour and a half that's right automobile would have had him there in an hour and a half he said by foot they would have been there in tre 4 days yes sir right but instead he said what did they do they wandered for 4 ear pre my they were shouting at the Red Sea that's right they were dancing at the Red Sea that's right the test Masters was dead behind and God said you got to go on I mean come on brother we're shouting brother we're dancing surely we found made it God said that's a stage but there's more to it let me just tell what a problem say he said a short Journey amen turned into years of wanding in the wilderness see all because they chose law over Grace he said Grace had provided them a great faith he said it provided them a Passover Lamb right it provided them a prophet that's right and it provided them an Angel that's right the Passover L was for their sins the prophet was their instructor and the angel was their gu his grace had oh godone but Grace had provided them an escape out of Egypt before they had any law that's right yes before there was a law there was a Grace yes sir before there was a law there was a Grace So before they come in the law and they stopped at the law God had a message of Grace that was provided for them them in the greatest Revival ever seen this revival they seen the powers of God they seen the sunshine mother the rest of the world darkless they seen the mighty hand of God deliver the innocent people they seen all this thing and they still chose law over Grace prise God I'm just going to say what a Propet said he said Israel's journey is a perfect time of the church today he said this children of Israel starting on their Journey perfect time for the church today making its way to the glory land don't you believe that we're each day gain a little ground as we go along come on don't get at me you be you ought to be you ought to be three steps ahead of where you were right you ought be three steps ahead of where you are Sunday amen come on Church am and tomorrow youall to be a step ahead of where you are tonight and by the time you get here Sunday y'all be four steps ahead of where you are right come on this is not a journey where we stop and we make temporary places perent we are going in the Revelation I said he said we're moving up we're not going down we're moving up see I want to say this as plain as I know now God's church is not going down we are moving up you know how I can say that it's because God foreen he ordained a church that was to appear before him in other words he's not going to come down amen for you to appear before him he's going to come down and appear and his appearing is going to be the food that's going to cause you to grow up to meet him come on Church he's not going to put a foot back on this Earth he said we will meet him in the air he said I'm going to come down he's already come down the shout is the descension of the might Angel Christ I got the message now come on friend we're not looking for the ladder we got the ladder for you ever forget this your objective is the rapture don't misunderstand me the message is not your objective the Rapture is your objective the message is God's provided way to get you to your objective come on church that message is the only way to get from here intera amen amen amen Mark Luther had a part but then he moved on to Wesley them said long come the Pentecostals moving up into the higher Heights and now he says when the Brethren receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost they said this is the summit this is all of it but Breen that's wrong see there is no Summit to God's power he just Mo on and on and on it's the unlimited resources of God it's never been T yet there's blessings and power that we know nothing about that's never even been revealed to archangels it's never been revealed to archangels is laying just aead for his church that will believe yes correct quote so let's move up and claim our rights that's right that's let's believe this plus how much more we can hear from God Amen we are the adoption people we are the adoption people it's not in the future we are the people that God has prepared and anointed to believe all things look at Romans 8:19 for the earnest expectation of the creature a been waited for what sir the manifestation of the sons of God down to read this powerful quote he said God hid it from the eyes of to the wise and prudent and promised to reveal it to the sons of God in the last days when the sons of God would be made manifest when God's sons that Rejoice with him before the foundation of the world when the Great revelation of the godhead and things would be brought down in the last days he would manifest those things to the sons of God you know the scripture teaches that and here we are it's no longer in the future here we are that's the reason God is opening the things to us God is bringing his sons into manifestation oh God I'm going to preach here he's going beyond the limitations he's going beyond the limitations of any human knowledge been way into the spiritual Revelations and then bringing it down amen come on don't get mad at me that you manifested Sons is what is pulling the Revelation out of your pastor out of the ministry we're seeking for a city that has Foundation whose buer and maker is God little bride you come from God and you got to go back to God come from God and you got to go back to God and this message is the transportation that's right [Music] do in these Services you breaking the own limitations breaking the own denominations breaking the own you're breaking beyond the ideas and you're breaking the mind of God and you're ping the Revel pouring for Revelation into your body [Applause] not [Music] she's the Revelation to change your body is in your body I know what s's desire is his desire is to stunt your growth and hinder your progress cuz he does not want you to go into the full promise right of the full land now Paul in Hebrews 13 goes all the way back to the Old Testament go ahead my brother preacher and he pulls a top yes sir from the Old Testament yes sir and shows that the sacrifice sir of the blood and bulls and goats I don't have time to get into all powerful thing here and then Paul writes about he in Hebrews 9 he writes about the blood right are you hearing me and the book of Hebrews is the most debated book in the entire Bible on who wrote it they believe Moses wrote Genesis more than they believe Paul wrote Hebrews but in the end God would send a prophet would say listen oh god listen I believe that Paul wrote the book of Hebrews now some people even around the message brother Steven they said well I've been reading this philosopher and I've been reading this kind but but I'm that a prophet [Music] was PA put my voice the you know why because the book of I'm pring another Ser the book of Hebrews has the key it's the key book of all Paul said the key to the entire C of scripture is found in the book of Hebrews the 13th chapter you know what he said he said it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today [Applause] a few years ago a few years ago we was up in psylvia brother Sean and I for some meetings and we was on the campground and this Church of Christ preacher come to brother Sean and he said sir you all believe in miracles brother Sean said we sure do he said he we don't believe in miracles he said there are no more miracles wow he said well what do you believe he said we believe the Bible he said well your Bible says that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever you know what that man looked at him and said he said that scripture don't even make sense he said go read the book of Hebrews the 13th chapter right he said and you'll be reading through there and I did it he said you'll be reading through there about about all different kinds of things and then all of a sudden out of nowhere Paul just says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today brother Sten if you're reading it it seems like it don't even fit in [Music] there you know why because it took a prophet theet yes yes the prophet brings the key to the generation now come on y'all if you want somebody to get in your house and you're not there you leave them a key you don't take the key and walk through the neighborhood saying on the front porch of under the m is the king under the front porch under the m is the king you yourself you take the and you call the person that you want [Music] to the whole world don't know where the neighborhood 2000 years been trying to get in God's [Music] house in the of Hebrews Jesus Christ is the yesterday [Music] up the walk to the door the she's in the house she's in the house house and when she opened the door she found the three room house she found the living room where you relax she found the kitchen that's right where you eat but then she found the bedroom she was not [Applause] [Music] a she was not brushing Brown she went to the living room she went in the kitchen she went all the way to the bedroom to the bedroom com the relationship when she's no longer a headless woman she has now got head she's Notting of her head she's not dating her head she is [Applause] married come on o SE there more than the G there more than the [Music] yard yall know I'm telling the truth it was misplaced until a prophet found it thank you Lord wonderful was here in there yes but he said here's the Keystone of the entire body can I prove it to you my brother can I prove it to you Church Hebrews 13 he writes about social duties he writes about marriage how it's sacred he writes about how there's duty to ministers and then right between writing about the duty of ministers and the doctrinal stability he says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever now don't get mad at me okay Luther didn't find that right didn't find thaten Charles Spurgeon didn't find that I'm this close to prach Charles Spurgeon did F so somebody tell me why that we got message preachers studying in Spurgeon Charles spon was a cigar smoking preacher he smoked AIG home I'll smoke a p as an incense of God he was a cigar smoking Prater yes he had lot of good things to say he was still a part of a camp of unclean living but in time God sent you [Music] a under a separation [Music] you can't be joined to something and separate somebody from it you cannot be joined to something and separate a group of people from it don't get mad at me don't get mad at me not far from here we've seen that nonsense we've seen it all over the world oh we believe the message we preach the message but down in their hearts they married to some Roman sister no wonder they can't F bring you it's because they themselves haven't come out with [Music] r do what you want to you never Le a bride to protection Maring in denominations we might as well preach for this the only reason this Prophet could take you out is because he himself come out he he was not with he was not da he was not looking at them and saying they got a lot more than we got they got more miracles than we got no he was saying come out and you got to to preach this message say what a [Applause] prophet I don't know I'm here I'm might well preach you hear me a prophet escaped it he got out of it remember brother said the little girl got off the bus and she met her friend and he said her friend and her walked off and ignored her mama remember that he said the reason she ignored her mama was because her mama had scars on her face her mama had scars on her face and she walked by her mama and brother said the bus driver could p young woman get over here he said you realize when your mama was your age she was twice as pretty as you are she was twice as pretty as you because of you he said do you know what happened we're not your house called on fire and she ran out of the fire she separated herself she St but when she got out there she you still she gra she wrapped her head in it and she ran back in the fire and found you when she found you she realized she had nothing to wrap you in so in order for you not to be starved she uned her [Applause] face she went you in the in the in the in the tow and she escaped the fire and today she Bears the scars so that you can be beautiful the Stars so that you can be beautiful you know where I'm going it's not just a story there was a prophet at the last days that knew the fire was coming upon our fire was bur and he escaped it out you remember was a in there so he put the word himself in the [Music] word denomination when he you he realized there was nothing to W you in he could come out unar so he loved you so much he B the Stars toeach the God he B the Stars to the he Stars GL GL GL out

away yes my brother my words shall never pass away my brother said take your time they you see they go beyond the camp of God's word to find their answer they go Bey on the camp of God's word to find their [Music] answer people are persuaded to their dogmas and Creeds without the camp in their Camp of dogma and Creed they have a camp that puts him in a camp he is the camp of Education theology Works doctor's decrees brother preach my brother thank I remember I remember when they told me as a young man brother what you need to do is you just need to go to college you know you you you young preachers you get inspired for the moment forget about the future you need to go to college and my god well then I heard a prophet and he said go spend years and let your fire die and then come talk about it he said it's minut if the candle get lit you going to run and tell everybody about it I may notet my know I may not have a lot my know but there's one thing I have and I can say with 100% Assurance I have the answer to the devil's question I have to the devil's question it's not education it's not psychology it's not modern worship it's not religious [Music] TR [Applause] [Music] dangerous people because we're one man Invasion going read you the quotes I'm going preaching to you Moses had to get out of the camp of the Egyptians that's in order to fulfill God's will for his life so God went to Moses's camp and Called Moses out of the camp called out called him out of the camp and made him in the form of the p that's right Moses met God and he ran and got his wife and baby and saddled up a mle and took off to Egypt and they said where you going Moses he said going to Egypt to take over they said it's a oneman Invasion well them said the difference was he said he had met God am and there was a people that was trapped in Egyptian confusion and here comes Moses with a pit of fire and announces to them the I am that I am has met me and there's more to your life than being baptized in titles than there's more to your life than follow women preachers there's more to your life than just put your name up are you hearing come on Church don't you forget this Israel Israel met God by the way of a Vindicated Prophet his name mes what the prophet of God said yes sir remember sometimes advancement this is me Advan require separation and God told Moses separate yourself and then he just swallowed up to naan and chorus he said now watch all the signs and wonders Vindicated his presence he said now the man made himself a camp a camp of creed are y'all ready for this can you take this quote a camp of GED and tradition not God's Camp of his word a camp of Their Own god brother says God speaking of God he had to leave them for he is the word amen don't you ever forget this part yes he cannot stay where people are taught out of his word so the minute you bring psychology to a pit it the minute you bring religious ideas to a pit apart from a Vindicated Prophet is the minute you put God outside of the C exactly right my he cannot stay in the camp he can't he never did he must stay exactly where his word is amen when God come among them he walked in but their Traditions had so took his place among them that he was a stranger to them the traditions of the fathers are you ready for this they were washing pants and they were grooving their hair and they were wearing certain buttons on their coat so they were no longer just called Christians they were wearing tape boy pins come on and I'm I'm a this and I'm a that no no but said this he said one said I'm a ston Pharisee and the other one's a sad and that had all taken the place of the word of God Among those men till when God come to Vis that he was a foreigner may I say this with love and respect but to drive it home it's the same thing today it hasn't changed a bit when he comes among the people in his power and manifestation to prove that his word is the same as today and forever that's right cuz he is the word what people says fortune tell else about Jesus only something like that some class you somewhere but it has to be that way amen amen can I can I leave you this go ahead my traditional teaching preach my brother preach my from the word crucifies the effect of the manifested Vindicated word of the hour traditional teaching apart from the word crucifies the effect of the manifested and Vindicated word let it speak for itself God God when the light shown up they didn't have to stand there explain it does God keep his word well there's the light that's it and Jesus said am you make the word of God of n effect through your tradition amen amen look at this word effect ter render void are you ready for this to deprive the force and Authority so tradition literally deprives the message of its force and Authority that's exactly right that's exactly right well I'm this exactly right they desired a denomination tradition instead of the true word being manifested and prove that it's God amongst the people are y'all ready for this by science through pictures a the same Angel of the Lord with pill of fire so they take this down my and they put up hofman's head of Christ confusion now don't get mad at me I believe in hman head of Christ but a prophet said that's a painting that is a painting to what he looked like when I saw him in the sa field his blow in the wind right he said that's the closest thing so what they do brother is they take the Vindicator down and they put up a painting and say now let's all just focus on Jesus so what they do is they take the fire out of the church and they replace it with a pain in time but don't you ever forget this we're not following a pillar of us it's a pillar of time it's AIC manifestes [Applause] [Music] the same one that on the earth in the body of Jesus Christ come upon his people last day were scientists took the picture of it the church is seeing it it's identified by TS and everything around and around yes sir yes sir GL they I'm closing they think the Traditions is of God but it won stand up with a word and neither does God vindicate it to be [Music] right the Jews did when the veil was written and brought brought God into Plain View hanging on the cross he was in plain view but they couldn't see it could it be possible amen that the Gentiles has did the same thing when they had the church ages of the Son of God but with now the veil of this denomination and things the veil of tradition that we've got since Pentecost with the Church Traditions has been rent things that people saying days of Miracles has passed and God has took the veil off of it and brought in plain view am amen and they're ready to crucify it again yes sir so 2,000 years ago he walked up Mount Calvary Lord do off his Hill laid down on a cross give up his life right they nailed his hands they nailed his feet they driven his side they crowned of thorns on his head hung him up and said crucify yes yep Hallelujah today yep they bring the message of the hour and the word of God look said they lay it on a wooden pit and with those denominational Creed nails they crucify the word of [Music] [Applause] God why because their Camp has set its boundary it wouldn't let them it wouldn't let him in the camp and it wouldn't let anybody watch this the reason they hated him is he was a breaker of their tradition he was an upet their churches exactly right to me he was a fortune teller he said and I believe if he come among us today he would be the same thing to us for we have tradition we have denomination we can't even get along with one another why there's only one place that a man can get along that's under the shed [Music] blood don't get mad at me Jesus walked to the Feast of Passover they're holding kosher bread in commemoration of what God done for him brother said like this he said this was at the Feast of Passover and Jesus walked in their midst and they were drinking from a fountain and holding the culture in commemoration of the man that F in the wilderness and Jesus cried right out in the midst and said I am the bread of life your fathers drank Mana or drank water out of the Rock and they're every one dead right right see what was once a blessed symbol had become a blinding tradition that's right there can I can I can I leave your F and I'm going home don't ever let anybody put any pressure on you when your righteous indignation Rises up when the message is being crucified in your presence come on Church well people now now I'm not against stream not okay the people get on stream and do and say things and send it in churches and then pastors like brother Steven have to get and corrected and then all of a sudden they've got the wrong Spirit they don't love right right no I tell you why it's because you're not sending your tradition EXA into the Bride of Jesus Christ and the Bethlehem dwellers holding their peace we've held our peace long enough we've taken a back long enough we get say well we need to get people to Christ to not the message long enough we're done with them Traditions let the word of God re in power and manifestation ration and dation in the midst of the church musicians we will not back up to the Miss no sir we will bow our need to tradition we're not Baptist we're not Pentecostal we're not Methodist we're Believers we have a right to this [Applause] word says why do y'all get up there and hark about the message we ain't harking we're preaching get it right Hallelujah can I tell you why that when somebody begins to crucify the effect of this message in your presence something Rises up within you can I proe it to you by the Bible because Revelation 18 the same voice of Revelation 18:4 is in Malachi 4 is in Revelation 10:7 is revelation 3 AM the voice of the seventh angel on Earth echoing the message from Heaven and the message from Heaven is come out of her my people right can I tell you the very next chapter from Revelation 18 is Revelation 19 and the prophet says when he comes he's going to be called the word of God riding upon a white horse and the followers of heaven will be behind him see that's why we can't hold our peace it's cuz we've got Captain Jesus's J inside of us and the prophet said what he done we'll do what he done we'll do you know what he done he broke the denominational Veil he broke the veil of tradition he broke the veils that was H for you he broke the veil of PR Kings like it he broke every no matter what PhD ml says if it's contrary to that Bible he broke that Veil we cross the Rhythm Veil we're on the other side now and you will see if you'll just do that break those old traditions and things and come to him you will see him standing Mighty conquer the Word of Promise to this age made manifest you'll see the Mighty God unveiled you'll see him right here Among Us unveiled the Mighty God am unconquered by tradition he's not conquer my tradition and neither is his Bri [Music] it's a powerful message I believe it's a powerful message are you hearing me tonight it's a powerful message exactly right the message of the hour is the plum line for the [Music] Bri can I can I ask you something yes sir brother how hard would it be to just get back to saying what a prophet said how hard would it be to just getting back to saying what a prophet said and just moving [Music] on don't just say what he said and just move [Music] on I know what you saying you what are you talking about I tell you what I'm talking about I'm talking about that tradition from denomination is trying to creep in the ranks of this [Music] message that's exactly right come we ought to get out of these camps we got to get back in the camp of God's word and say what a prophet said amen and move on Amen we don't need you to explain it why he said it how he said it who he said it to the reason why you think he said it people people get all brother brother Sten they get all watered up about people shouting and dancing in church and forget we literally got a picture of a prophet with his leg hanging over the pull pit if you want to see it I got with his leg hanging over the pull pit shouting and dancing in the service preacher God we don't need a bunch of pictures around the church and literally forget we got a prophet standing in Brandon Tabernacle with that picture behind you listen Friends unconquered by tradition amen unconquered by tradition I'm y'all forgive me I got a I got a whole message here I didn't get to it but I'll say this it's a new land and we ain't doing things in this land like you did your denomination sir no sir it's a new land amen it's changed our way of thinking am it's changed our way of talking amen it's changed our way of preaching it's changed our church we look at different we' gone Bey on the gates we've gone beyond your limitations we've gone beyond your hindrances for S un uned [Music] manif all father we

father I pray that you would increase the courage of every word here father there's such a pressure in these last days thank you Lord Lord men have through the years have blazed Trails for new revelation they've left the confines of the word of God and what a prophet T and Lord because they think that things brother said are a little too radical or they're a little too far out there they're trying to find a more refined and Polished way to approach the people of God but Lord we're not compromisers we're not chicken-hearted Eagles we're Eagles through and through and we'll hunt for our man we'll dig through 47 to 65 we're not ashamed of anything we find if a prophet said it we'll stand with it because Lord we're riding behind you the word of God lord we have an altar thank you Lord

Revelation and they begin to walk they begin to walk walking in power walking in Authority father I pray for every believer here tonight Lord father I know what this church has come through and what they' had to stand against but father you didn't separate them and leave an idle out of the Wilderness but Lord you separated them from something to something Lord you separated them from something to something and that's this unlimited BR Revival Lord the devil's done everything he could have shut this pastor up in this church but they're still sounding Out the voice of Revelation they're still digging to the word of God and establish in their hearts and lives under what a prophet has taught father may they never lose the ability to be taught by the message of the hour father I pray Lord you
