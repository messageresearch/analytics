gracious heavenly father lord we come at thanksgiving to you this evening time father we thank you for a place that you have prepared for us we thank you for this place we thank you for a place in your own body that you've placed us by your spirit father we thank you for your word we thank you for the gifts you've placed among us lord you have used to reveal yourself to us father lord continue to mold us and shape us lord father you know the hearts the night and the needs we have come with and lord you've already promised to supply all our needs according to your riches in glory let that

it was good to be in the house of the lord we commit the offerings and the tights into your hands father lord bless our fellowship together with you in the name of our lord jesus christ amen thank you lord brother robert has a special for us as well i'll call him back up in a second but before i do i want to make a couple announcements as i take the offering you may be seated so brother john wanted me to mention to the church about the fellowship at his house this saturday um parking spaces are limited um so if there's any way you could possibly carpool um that would be that would be great to limit the amount of vehicles that are there at the house and um they'll uh there'll be somebody there kind of orchestrating the parking if you not if you don't know what to do maybe just uh have one of your kids run up to the house and get brother john and he can tell you exactly where to park but we'll be parking like along the road we just want to try to make sure traffic can get through so we want to make sure that there's no blockages in the road so if you have any questions about that reach out to a deacon or brother john if you're still needing his address reach out to a deacon as well or myself or brother john and we can uh we can give you the address for the gathering on saturday also um i was speaking to brother chango and he wanted me to mention the meetings that are going on in virginia brother sean martin is having meetings and i have a pamphlet for it i believe it's at the end of the month the end of april going into may and it's going to be wednesday thursday friday our evening services and there'll be two services on saturday and a service sunday morning so if anybody's interested in that and wants any more details just come and see me and i can i can get the pamphlet over to you about the details for that meeting so if anybody's interested in that just let me know and we can get that over to you and brother robert if you're ready thank you praise the lord it's good to be back the lord has has been good to us this week we had a visit out west and um i really want to thank god for his grace and revealing himself to us we tuned into the service on sunday and um it just just been on my heart all week about how the father is seeking fellowship with us um and you know it's sometimes we are more privileged than you realize there's some people that you know god sent a man and a word to them because he had called them out for fellowship but when the man spoke they were just hearing the man and they missed what god was calling them for but i pray that doesn't happen in here amen it's a little song in my heart how can he desire to have fellowship with me pictures and photographs memories of old stories in every frame that have never yet been told and there's a picture in my kitchen that displays a supper scene and there's a meaning within those words that from now i've never seen how can he desire to have fellowship with me there must be something more within that only he can see i pray dear lord take all my life i give it all to thee grant that every day you'll commune with me on the road to emails three men walked one day as they reached their destination the two men begged the third to stay and as they shared together breaking bread and pouring wine i finally now realize the simplicity of this sign how can he desire to have fellowship with me there must be something more within that only he can see i pray dear lord please take my life i give it all to thee and grant that every day you will commune with me oh how could he desire to have fellowship with me there must be something more within that only he can see i pray dear lord please take my life i give it all to thee and grand that every day you will commune with me grand that every day lord [Music] amen it's a revelation psalm says how could he how could he desire to have fellowship with me and and the revelation is is worth his bride and he wants that fellowship with his bride it's so hard for us to wrap our human mind around how he could choose us and we could even look around us at maybe even some other denominational uh churches or people and think oh well they might be a better person than i am but he chose us he chose us to be his bride and that's that's the secret that's the revelation and we're so grateful that he desires to have fellowship with us and it's gonna happen we're not far from it so we just uh we look forward to that day we're close friends don't don't be sleeping because he's coming soon key qfc [Music] and that goes right along right in line with this song as well if you wanna know [Music] where i'm going oh where i'm going [Music] someday soon oh and if anybody asks you where i'm going where i'm going someday soon [Music] i'm going up beyond [Music] oh i'm going up beyond [Music] i'm going up beyond her oh i'm going up beyond her to be with my lord amen oh and i can take the pain the heartaches that it brings comfort is endowing the church i'll soon be gone oh and as god gives me grace i'm gonna run this christian race oh until i see my savior oh [Music] oh going up beyond earth church i'm going up beyond to be with my lord now sing it like this say i'm going in a rapture oh i'm going in a rapture amen i'm going in a rapture oh i'm going in a rapture to be with my lord we're going to do that again i wonder if you can stand with me and sing it say i'm going in a rapture oh i'm going in a rapture [Music] oh i'm going in a rapture [Music] oh i'm going in a rapture to be with my lord i can take the pain oh i can take the pain the heartache that it brings oh the comfort is and very soon as god gives me grace i'm gonna run this christian race [Music] and as our pastor comes this evening sing it one more time say i'm going in the rapture i'm going in the rapture oh i'm going in the rapture oh i'm going in the rapture to be with my lord oh i'm going in the rapture there's no doubt in my mind i'm going in the rapture oh i'm going in the rapture to be with my lord i'm going up yonder say we're going up yonder oh we're going up yonder oh we're going up oh beyond going up beyond to be with our lord we're going in a rapture oh we're going interaction we're going in a rapture [Music] amen amen how many are going to the rapture how many are going to the rupture okay and nobody want to stay here this world is not our home we got to go up and come back in the millennium and go up again and stand on the breath of the earth and when they destroy everything then our city our future home over there you don't have to pay a mortgage you don't need approval it's already paid and furnished and everything is ready amen you just enter there and you're going to see your address because we will have that knowledge when you enter you know this is my house this is my house this is my house it's going to be fitted for you feed it at your test just like the way you want it everything just the way you want it because he's the king he knows exactly what we need amen blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah good to see you all tonight we praise the lord for another opportunity there was a prayer request that was sent online by brother kalima he will be flying on friday for his brother-in-law funeral and he will be coming back so lord willing he'll be here in the morning uh on our own regular service so just please remember him in prayer so that he goes and comes back and everything will be fine amen blessed be the name of the lord i believe brother abel already spoke about brother sean martin if you need information brother abel is there he can uh help you on that this coming saturday i believe brother robert the way there is good to the best of my understanding amen so we will be at brother john porter house amen what is the time three o'clock american time [Laughter] amen three o'clock unless you have uh the legitimate reason be there on time amen because remember we got service in the morning if you get there at seven i don't know whether you're gonna see us on question number 13 or number 20 or something like that some of the questions i cannot answer them here because of youtube i'm gonna answer them there so if you miss it you just got to make up no recording it's for the local church amen even if we record his stay for the local church amen i have received quite a few questions but i will advise and i talked to brother robert about this but what i believe we can do except if your trustee says no because they're the boss to deal with it amen i will order if the trustees say yes so you plead with the trustee go beg them and ask them hey man if the trustee agree with it i would like to order the cod book church its conduct order and doctrine i believe volume one and volume two is twelve dollars a piece so we might try to order fifty of them so to make sure every family get one and every young people get one if you need an additional one if you want to help the church you want to purchase it fine it's in the voice of god it is 12 i will strongly recommend that because some of the questions that are asked are coming straight they are straight in that cod book if you open you read it you're going to see your question and your answer plan so i'm not going to give you a different answer than what the bible says and what brother bradham says amen but i will strongly encourage the church if possible if you get that book at least one day per day just read one question if i say two it's going to be a problem then i have kids then i got to work and all kinds of stuff so i'm just saying just one if you want to read two three that's fine but at least every day just read one question and one answer and then you close if you have time you can go two just do it every day so per month you should have 30 question and 30 answer if you do that for two months you're gonna see how spiritually you're gonna grow most of your question doctrine and everything is straight they ask brother brother usually if you go on the table all these things are scattered so somebody pull all of them together and put it in one book if you go to the end it tells you page number so and so brother branham is dealing with the hair praise number page number so and so brother branham is dealing with the millennium everything is line up if everybody can get it at least one question before we go three months you're gonna find your spiritual levels showed up like that amen then some of the stuff we say won't be strange everybody clear now let's go to our service tonight thank you for the musician so you beg the trustee if they say no you're in trouble [Laughter] sorry brother micah let's go to genesis chapter 39. if you need the quote why i say the trustee you see me i will give it to you i believe i already gave it to the church but it's something very spiritual it's gonna help a lot i want you to get in the word you come here the bible say brother brother i'm saying the bible say brother branham say you go home you're thinking about it you go to work you're thinking about it and you read it for yourself amen if you want to glean all of these things yourself sometimes it takes a long time to put it together and when you read a question and if you have difficulties then you're welcome to call the pastor amen then we can go ahead and talk several questions they already answered right there so we're going to try to give it to you for free if you know you're not going to read it just let me know i give it to somebody else but if you don't read it you're going to lag behind we don't want it genesis chapter 39 when you come in the meetings stay prayed up we go into bloody john porter because it's going to be question and answer and some of them are really good it's telling me people's mind now is thinking about the law their work and everywhere amen and one more thing when we sing we're not singing to a man when you get here be free amen brother abel is singing i'm going on beyond he's expecting the congregation to respond but it's only few voices so if you have that habit of getting to church and standing like this or just clapping hand make sure you talk amen make sure you can sing amen we want to hear loud voices if you need a scripture you see me amen yeah so there is no religious spirit here you should be free genesis chapter 39 we talk about the sister the sister we're gonna shift a little bit to the brother i believe i hope every young man was here in church tonight that could be very good genesis chapter 39 verse 7 if you're there you can say a man amen and he came to pass after these things that his master's wife is talking about potiphar's wife so if you notice this wife this woman is a married woman amen his master's wife cast her eyes upon joseph that's a spirit of adultery and she said lie with me because joseph was a handsome man but joseph accepted right no he's the one that started then gave away you might be seated amen amen we heard a lot i went i fell i went i fell i went i fell there is an example here of somebody who was there and did not fall amen so where are our joseph nowadays where you can come here and give us a testimony say i was almost gone but the lord protected me not i'm sorry i already did i'm sorry i already did we're going to forgive you but we want those great testimony like joseph amen but joseph refused and say unto his master's wife behold my master what if not what is with me in the house and he has committed all that he had to my hand in other words look at the trust your husband has given to me everything he has given to me there is none greater in this house than i neither had he kept back anything from me but who the only thing that potiphar could not share was his own wife we don't share wives we don't share husbands amen because thou art his wife it's a possession how then can i do this great water wickedness it's something bad adultery is a bad thing and sin against who you are sinning against the husband and you are also singing sinning against god double verse 10 and he came to pass as she sped to joseph howe you see she's persistent so brother stephen because she insisted day by day then i gave away you see that he heard can not answer her he still refused to lie by her or to be with her and he came to pass about this time that joseph went into the house to do his business just a normal word and there was water you see why you don't have to be alone with a woman you see why you don't have to be alone with a man and there was none of the men of the house there with in other words it happened one day no worker was there beside joseph so this time the devil increased he moved from level a to level b level b now he's on level c amen and she caught him by his water what i want you to keep here is this is a married woman amen the houseman is not home amen she's anointed with an adultery spirit anybody clear and then she has the courage to catch joseph with his with her hand in other words you don't engage i'm going to do it amen and she caught him by his gum and saying lie with me and he left his garment in her hand and fled and got him out he was locked up being innocent amen let's go to proverbs chapter seven an immoral woman a wicked woman brother branham say one place that potiphar knew that her her wife was not good his wife was not good amen blessed be the name of the lord proverbs 7 verse 21 are you there you know how i preach if not i increase the volume proverbs 7 verse 21. we're going to come back to proverbs 7. i believe several weeks ago i gave you proverbs 7 proverbs 7 proverbs 7 and we never touch it now tonight i thank god we have a little bit of time so let's dig onto it amen verse 21 with a much fair speech it's a bad woman we already explained you this she caused him to yield with joseph day by day she continued she insisted that joseph refuse but for some reason this boy gave up she caused him to yield with the speech with the flattery of her lips she did water she forced him with the flattery of the lips day by day by her speech and her flattery we already explained you this her word are sweeter than a honeycomb anybody clear verse 22 he goes this young man not like joseph this is an opposite he goes after her immediately as water as a knox goes to the water you go into your death and as a fool to the correction of the stocks till a water there was a narrow somebody was waiting there amen when you give up when you give in to this woman there is somebody ready to kill you amen and who has the power of death the devil amen till a dog struck through his liver as a bird hastened to the snare and knows not that it is for his life verse 24 hearken to me now therefore owe you water children young people and attend to the words of my mouth let not your heart decline to her ways go not astray in her path for she has cast down many wounded amen yeah many strong water men have been slammed by her by her 27 her house this woman has a house we're going to go natural and we go spiritual her house is the way to water you see why they kill you so the house of this woman is a way to help if you get under this woman you have your ticket to hell come on going down to the chambers of water the chambers of death the chambers of death do you want to go there amen how many remember when we talk about the mystery of the pyramid you remember that you remember the descending way pathway all the way to the subterranean how many remember that oh my god i might have to revisit that again do you remember this pyramid do you remember this you remember the descending passage because in the pyramid when you enter you don't go up you go first down then you begin to go up because the way up is down amen then if you notice there is a point right here where when you go down there is an ascending passage everybody clear but instead of going on the ascending passage that descending passage continued down the way down there everybody remember then it get to the subterranean chambers do you remember that oh you forgot how many remember that okay please be the name of the lord then when you leave the subterranean chamber you're going up to the ascending channel when you go to the ascendant channel then that opened the door to the queen chamber do you remember that because jesus christ came went down down all the way to hell then he resurrected then jesus ascended after he ascended he opened the door to the church at pentecost you remember that again then when the church started the broad chamber opened up he started the seven church ages which is the seventh uh step of the prophet chamber in a great gallery everybody remember then when you get to the last step which is the great step or the introductory prank that's where malachi 4 take you into the king chamber and when you enter the king chamber there is an empty tomb which was speaking about the resurrection do you remember amen but we are right here on the subterranean chambers these chambers are called the chambers of death make sense so when you get into this woman house if you follow her path you're going straight to hell and the subterranean chamber when you go there there is a place that was unfinished because when christ came down he brought an atomic bomb and he destroyed an empty paradise amen that's why that place looks like a wall happened there anybody clear so far that's your territory of the black dog right here you follow there but the problem is when brother branham went to hell he found everything that the women are doing on their eyes on their makeup everything was in hell and when he went to jesse penny he found everything that he saw in hell back in jesse penny why because hell open her door and pour itself upon the earth amen and when you look at the pyramid the holy ghost shows me that before coming to church there is a message that was explained right there if you look up there there is an escape water there is an escape shaft everybody clear so when the broad age started here pentecost with the church when god sent the holy ghost and the holy ghost came down on the day of pentecost the spirit that left judah that black dog escaped right here and came back again and poured itself down on pentecost as well you see that everything was written in a pyramid you need a prophet you see now so that black dog escaped right here by the escape shaft and went up and when the holy ghost poured down the antichrist spirit also poured on and paul have to begin to fight with it so now hell has been back again on earth everybody clear so far did you get it if not we might have to go to those channels let's go to song of solomon chapter one so this woman have the chambers of death i never understood that escape shaft until before church amen song of solomon chapter 1 if you dare you can say amen let's go to verse four join me we already explained that we will run after you these are the virgins connected with christ the king has brought me into his water these are different chambers you see that in the song of solomon they are chambers of the king which are chambers of life because he is life the other one are the chambers of death anybody clear amen and if you notice it's plural there and in the proverb is also plural it's just a perversion by the devil and the king has brought me into his chambers plural you don't want to go to the chambers of death but you want to go to the chambers of life here the king has brought me into his chambers we will be glad and rejoice in you we will remember your love remember that because he put a mark on you that's your first marriage your first relationship with christ we will remember your love more than wine the one of babylon the upright love you in other words the just people love you everybody clear let's go to chapter 4 of song of solomon then we're going to pray you need to stay up because we're going to travel some avenues chapter 4 if you dare you can say amen verse 12 a garden enclosed is my water in the book of the song of solomon the king is a man follow me and the the queen or the tsunami she's a woman and the garden encloses my water this woman is a sister brother kelly amen she is a sister she is a garden that is enclosed you see when they say garden in the garden of eden you know what it means now my sister my water so before salomon put the word spars he first put the word what she must be converted first and believe the message just like you before she become your wife my sister then my spouse that's why paul said that we also have the right to marry a sister not a woman amen my sister karma my spouse and a spring that is water and a fountain that is water in other words this woman is a virgin woman anybody clear the king is a man and the queen is a woman and this is a relationship between god and his bride amen a virgin bride let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy father and for everything you're doing for us father thank you for giving us another opportunity tonight to gather together around the revealed word of the hour lord i have done what every man on planet earth can do if you give them an ability to do it lord but to come into interpreting your word and feeding your people father this is not a work of a man you are the great shepherd and we just a shepherd under the great shepherd father may you move me completely out of the way and may the holy spirit the inside teacher himself come down lord father and minister to your children heal those that are sick bond i have the broken hearted and father answer the question to your children father we commit this service unto the hand sealing the devil out completely of this place and his army and only the holy spirit and the angel of the lord may they be welcome in this building lord as we committed all in jesus precious name amen and amen god bless you we're still working on your team so bear with me and we will see with brother david how we can do it because we're on part 28 so the team will help you remember part one we are dealing with this part two we were dealing with this if you want to go back and look at that amen when we saw on sunday according to ezekiel chapter 16 the bible indicated unto us the area where you get uh tempted when you're a teenager everybody remember that we talked about the fashion the other appearance your home care your diet your jewelry and your jewels everybody clear now let's go to first timothy chapter two because we touch on this but there is more into his and the holy spirit opened something more to me this morning and now i understand why sarah called abraham my lord i used to wonder why now i got it this morning i was just opening first corinthians and begin to read that boom it came up but it's dealing with her first timothy chapter two verse nine in like manner also that who we're dealing with women women adorn themselves in modest appearance the word modest over there means respectable everybody understand because sometimes they say modest people don't get it something that when they look at you they respect you amen the women must be uh uh master don themself in modest apparel come on with shamefestness that word shame fateness means decency everybody clear decency and with water sobriety sobriety means appropriate everybody clear sobriety karma not with water breaded hair the second part now he's going to the second part this one is one woman the second is a different woman braided hair brother steven should we braid hair karma or water gold i want you to remember this gold what else pearl should i wear my wing and what costly array everybody clear now when we look on festivity we found out that paul if you look spiritually paul is describing two women because if you just go by not breaded hair then african american ladies are in trouble for breading their hair amen and they got to stop it that's why you need a prophet amen if i just stopped right there i said no bread in there all the african-american sisters are in trouble amen what does it mean braided hair anybody here if you look right here paul is describing two women anybody here the first woman that paul is describing is a woman that wears her clothes in a respectable way can you say amen her clothes are decent and her clothes are appropriate when you wear your clothing you must make sure i wish this was sunday and everybody was here you must make sure that when you wear your clothes your clothes through your clothing somebody when they look at you they must respect you that's why a woman cannot wear a cloth that is showing her cleavage of her breast because when people see your breasts they don't respect you you are portraying something different so sister before you come to church make sure you look at your mirror and make sure you check yourself if your breasts are exposed you must put something under to make sure you cover your breast everybody clear so far make sure your clothing are respectable your clothing are decent they are not provoking people they are not tight they are not short in a way that is going to provoke somebody to last after you and your clothing must be appropriate this goes for the men and the women you cannot wear clothes that look like a gangster you cannot be a man wearing tight clothing it is giving a wrong message like you a homosexual you cannot wear any kind of jean you can wear your jeans but make sure your jeans don't look like crazy they don't have all kinds of stuff put around them amen because somebody when they look at you wearing your gym or your suit your suit must be respectable it must be decent and it must be appropriate you don't wear stuff like star of the hollywood we are not star of the hollywood we are star from the kingdom of god can you say amen [Applause] the second woman that paul is talking about is an immoral woman where do you get that paul says that bat which becomes to woman professing water the first woman with water good work remember in ephesians chapter 2 we have created for what good works in 1st peter chapter 3 verse 1 peter says likewise you wives talking again to women be in subjection to your own husband that if any obey not the word they also made without the word so we need more your life than your preaching be won by the conversation that word conversation means life of the wives why they behold your chest life in other words they're gonna observe you and see how the way you behave why they behold your chest conversation coupled with water with respect whose adorning let it not be off the water out there in other words outside adorning of water playing her back again to the same thing pulsing instead of calling that breaded peter is calling that plating everybody clear bleeding hair camera and of wearing water you see the same thing here paul say gold camera and of putting water and putting on apparel that putting on our prophet peral in another translation it's talking about those expensive clothes which is costly which paul explained here let it be the hidden man in other words peter when he started describing peter begin to develop the second woman make sense now peter is going back to the first woman paul started by the first woman then he explained you the second woman but peter started from the second woman and begin to explain to you the first woman one is a christian woman one is not anybody clear verse 4 but let it be the water the hidden men of the water so this first woman here is talking about the inside man the man of the heart which speak of the word so everybody clear let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not water so this inner man here is not corruptable it's an eternal person anybody clear a person that has been born again a person that does not die it's not corruptable everybody creates so far blessed be the name of the lord even the ornament of the water this is not a natural ornament make sense it's an ornament of a milk and water and a quiet water a meek and quiet spirit are the characteristic of a lamb follow me that's why when adam and eve saw themselves fig leaves when god came he condemned their appearance he condemned their government and god took a lamb and kill a lamb and cloth them with a lamb because the clothing of a lamb has a message of a meek and a quiet spirit that's why the dogs can come and sit on the lamb because the lamb is a meek beast everybody clear the dove will never sit on a wolf anybody clear so peter said that let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptable and eternal even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of god a water so god when he looks at you god is more interested on your inner person anybody clear this is the person that value much that's why brother branham said that a soul of a man worth ten thousand world your soul is more precious in the eyes of god that's the reason why it took the creator of heaven and earth to come down and died on the cross and shed his blood just to redeem your soul because your soul is precious to him everybody clear so far come on verse 5 for after this manner this is the way in the old time that the holy water women who trusted in who adorned themselves so they all christian people focus more on the inside person than the outside person the bible didn't say they didn't wear clothes the bible didn't say they didn't take a shower but their focus is what is first seek you face the what do you remember on sunday that's the gentle focus more on here versus over there the christians start here before we get there amen now what about the breaded of hell because paul is introducing something him and peter about the hair which is a territory of the black dog but if you go to the book of ezekiel ezekiel never says something about her paul and peter introduced the hair what is going on with braided hair brother stephen brother branham brother branham question and answer does this first timothy 2 9 everybody clear now mean a woman cannot break her water that's why i want you to have the cod book because it's going to be clear does broad hair means water breaded hair brother brandon answer now look sister i'm glad that followed this i never fix it there but it just followed that good if you go back to the previous question and answer you're going to understand why brother branham says that notice a breaded hair in that day that's why you need a prophet amen you are saved by this pentecostal get through this and they get in trouble the breaded hair in that day in other words in the time of paul and the time of peter when they spoke about breaded hair breaded hair in that day was a son of water a street woman so this woman right here is a christian woman but this woman here is a street woman or a prostitute makes sense so when paul is instructing the church and when peter is instructing the church they are both giving the same answer the same recommendation to the church they are telling the church that look at your women when you dress yourself make sure you don't copy on a prostitute make sense make sure you don't copy on the hollywood star because brother branham said hollywood star by kissing men and women on television it is a sign of prostitution some of them are married women but you can get their movie when they're having sex with other men everybody clear yet they are married amen so paul and peter are telling you don't copy after a street or a prostitute anybody clear make sense now now you can braid your hair but don't braid it like a prostitute make sense let's continue now braided hair in that day was a son of a street woman that is what she done braided her hair and paul said to who makes sense the christian now that are dawning not let it be over breaded or breaded and breaded it is the water so that answered that question already anybody clear now to break the hair because it looked like the rest of the water so the message key here make sure when you dress yourself make sure young man when you dress yourself don't look like the world because the world is under hedonism clear now you must make sure that your government is respectable is decent it's appropriate amen if you want to wear a hat that's normal but don't go and have a big heart that look like a crown that is not appropriate for a christian do you hear me a man can wear a hat but make sure your heart is appropriate amen that just dropped and i had to deliver it now you are supposed not to look like the water or act like the world see the women are supposed to be different there anybody following me praise god now breaded hair now today bread and hair is welcome everybody clear now are you free now praise the name of the lord amen breaded hair is pretty and it's a long ways from the water so when you dress yourself when you fix your hair young sister young man make sure you are not fixing your hair after the fashion of the world because that's a territory of the black dog your hair gives a message everybody clear if you cut your hair like a like a hip-hop star you don't know why they're cutting the hair like that amen now brother branham continues he says it is long ways from the fashion of the world now you see the women the way they do the hell today just keep your hair in anyway just don't look like the water don't look or dress like it if they were short ever clear you were working so no shot for a sister ever clear if they do their hair cut it all off and bob it and do them ever you just let yours work alone because the bible says that a woman should not cut her hair everybody clears so far let's continue brother branham the question was does breaded means blood that means breading yes that's right now on the street now i looked that up to find out years ago what the braided hair meant see the woman actually the woman of old they just pulled their hair back and tie it more inner ponytail today so what you call ponytail today that's what they used to do that in a long time by holy women back here and the bad women were the ones that were breaded hell but today you can bread your hair it won't do any problem because the stem have changed are you following me praise the name of the lord and they went around they had robots like that but the women on the street took their hair and braided it all across their head and wrap it around like that and put flowers in it and things like that and that was kind of a flapper on the street just like we would see a flapper today the way she does what she dresses so the message that paul and the message that peter are giving here is when you wear your clothing make sure your clothing are water respectable they are decent they are appropriate don't copy after the prosthetic don't copy after hollywood don't copy after the world don't copy after the fashion of the world if every woman in america is doing the hair a certain way don't do it that time because you are going after the fashion of the world ever clear make sure when you want to fix your hair you check your muddies and your objective if you are doing your hair to look like a certain star you are getting a wrong spirit on yourself amen you must make sure when you wear your hair when you wear your clothing when you wear your suit when you wear your paint when people see you they are not too much attracted by your outer appearance but there is an atmosphere of a meek and quiet spirit that attract them what are you talking about brother stephen look the bible says don't act like the water now you understand what hidden means amen dewitt unbeliever don't yoke yourself with them come out from among them don't be this way if you love the water can you preach with me if you love the water the word all the things of the world which is the water the fashion that word come from the greek word cosmos which means the what the fashion of the world if you after every fashion that is coming up on television and you want to make sure you on the page you under a wrong spirit everybody clear the word there is not earth it's a greek word is cosmos which means the world order if we love the fashion of the earth the world if we love the trend of the water that's why paul in the day he condemned the women that was bred in hell but today we're gonna condemn the trend of this world according to the message of the hour ever here they do this you do that they do this you do that they change suit you change suit they change shirt you tension you under a demonic spirit everybody clear when people see you you will notice that your clothing is talking more than your character you become like a star you have a repetition on clothing versus having your reputation on your character that is wrong your character must speak more than your clothing everybody care blessed be the name of the lord think this is a wonderful time we have all these things if you think that it's because you are thinking wrong it is it is pervaded by the devil if you love the lord if you love the world i'm sorry order and the things of this what present world it is because the love of god is not even in water remember that oh god look what we are looking into what are you trying to copy yourself who do you want to be who do you want to be you want to be a hollywood star you want to be like who who do you cop your hair amen blessed be the name of the lord if you want to get close to god just get close to love just love god with all your heart with all your soul and we follow your mind with all your strength just wrap yourself in a bundle of love watch that man that you didn't like like you did you ever get around anybody you have seen nice people you couldn't hardly stand to be around them now you know that's right isn't it and i have seen people that maybe you just love to be in their presence haven't you seen people like that do you realize that you are sons of god the atmosphere everybody clear and the air that you live in you create a water a situation around you that either do water or it does water so the spirit that you have if you have a last spirit on you is going to just certain kind of men to you amen it is a make and a quiet spirit that is more important damn meek and the quiet spirit comes by the atmosphere you have around you amen that atmosphere must take over your clothing when somebody see you she said so and so she's dressed good but there is something about that spirit that is good that's what you want not them sitting at your clothing and they can't go to your personality then it's a problem then your clothing are speaking more amen better leave that subject alone and read what i'm going to because i'm afraid you are not getting that you see that is what deeper things that the church has yet got to do what that's right deeper things but when you come into the real it's not something way off you can understand it's just as close as your hand is to you you just look over the top of it it's so simple till you look over it and that is what does it in other words your clothing must be a clothing that is appropriate that is respectable that is decent that reflect a meek and quiet spirit that reflect the lamb that speak about redemption when people see you they see more a christian versus what you put on everything clear so far brother pronoun in isaiah chapter five which we will get on sunday lords willing i believe it is talk about women how they will work changeable apparel and everything like that but there was water pride and welcome do you hear me that was pride and stuff put on if you do that for prague then it is what no matter how good your clothing is no matter how respectable how decent how appropriate your clothing is you must make sure you check the spirit in you if you wearing clothing to chef that is wrong you under a demonic spirit you run away from here but the black dog will catch you here with a proud religion demon ever clear i'm not wearing like a prostitute i'm roaring my clothing pretty good but i'm wearing that for people to see me then you in trouble you still under the black dog amen you run from here but he caught you here under a proud spirit that's the reason why you want to show off that's the reason why you wear a cloth you can't wait to be taken a picture and post it on whatsapp because those that miss them must see you on the clothing and you acting shy you think we don't pick it up amen you acting like god bless you happy summer oh happy vacation happy birthday but when we look at that picture we see a proud spirit she just want to show off her clothing she got a brand new clothes she want to show off her blind bag she got a brand new cam and some of them will pull here so they make sure it is gucci or it's so-and-so so that you see it very clear the spirit is wrong amen they want you to see their brain and make sure you check their brain you see sister talking and they put it like this to make sure you see the brand that is a demonic spirit it is a religious spirit it is wrong the devil got you under good clothing with the wrong spirit if you do that for proud then it's what examine your heart before god if there is no scripture for it and the way the spirit leads you you go ahead and do water everybody clear so far let's go to revelation 17. anybody clear so far people act on social media like we are blind it is a shame i can look at your facebook and know that you're in war with somebody by just the thing you're posting i can tell you have a problem with somebody else give me your phone number don't block me i will send you a message amen give me your phone number don't block me i'll send you a message you won't take too long i'll tell you look at this amen you are fooling nobody you're fooling yourself amen what does a married woman have to put portraying what is wrong you already married what do you want who do you want to say check mark let your husband do that what else do you want so you want us to be complimenting you something is wrong something is wrong revelation 7 10 first one and there was and there came one of the seven angels everybody knows that angel right you know him right we went through this if you don't know him you go back to the sermon had seven vows and talked with me saying to come here ever clear i will show you the water the judgment of a great water now brother branham is inviting the bride to come and see a woman that is what a prostitute ever clear this one caliber 2. make sense everybody clear paul presented that woman and paul say braided hair in my day gold pill costly expensive everybody peter presented that woman say plated hair gold pale costly everybody here now brother branham is going to present to us the woman now it's our day watch that paul and peter describe the hair you ready verse two verse one i will show you the judgment of the great whole that sits upon many waters with whom the king of the earth has committed water this woman has a spirit of fornication america and the inhabitant of the earth has been drunk with the wine of her fornication so he carried me away in the water so this vision that brother branham is giving to us is a spiritual sight not a natural in other words come with me in the spirit i'm going to show you how a prostitute on the end time will look like make sense spiritually anybody clear amen and i was he carried me in the spirit into the wilderness and i saw a woman sit upon a scarlet color robe a beast full of name of blasphemy having seven heads and ten holes you won't see this naturally this is the spirit it's showing you the beast the evil spirit that is there it is an evil woman verse four and the woman was arrayed in water and water purple and scarlet very costly array make sense now look at your board this one check everybody here spiritually speaking she's coming back to the description of paul and peter ember clear praise the name of the lord karma and deck with water watch your board here everybody kill you now check you there come on and then precious stone and water look at your board again what is here how are these people lining up how are they lined up paul peter now it's the ministry of brother branham he's pointing you costly array purple scarlet he says god and what pearl and he added even precious stone now this is the end time hey but here having a golden cup in her hand full of the abomination and filthiness of her fornication and upon her forehead was a name written water mystery water babylon the great the mother of water heart and abomination of the water this babylonian spirit is now spiritually in the end time your hollywood your fashion your world everything hidden is man that's why he bring it to christia to christmas and easter egg and rabbit we show you that it's a babylonian spirit anybody clear verse six and i saw the woman drunken with the water remember when you follow this woman she's gonna kill you you get killed and go into the chambers of what you follow me now he said is he clear now she's drunken with the blood of the sand she kills and with the blood of the mortal of jesus christ she destroyed christian and when i saw her i wonder with great water she looks beautiful despite all of this and john said wow how can a beautiful woman be so evil be so cruel she was in purple no wonder brother branham said there will be a woman beautiful in purple evil do you think those things came up just like that scriptural the message is scriptural anybody clear job to revelation 18 chapter 18 if you're there you can say amen verse seven that woman how much she glorify herself she's proud look at her on facebook how much she glorify herself and live deliciously so much torment and sorrow give her for she says in her heart i see a water you remember queen vasa so this woman is a queen she's also married remember the wife of potiphar is everything blending on on wednesday get really yummy is everything blending okay she sits as a queen and i am no what we do and shall see no water i am no widow because i am married she still claims she is married but her life is a life of a prostitute party for wife was still married but she was living a life of a prostitute trying to kill joseph if joseph would have consumed her they would have killed him but joseph refused and joseph went to prison and joseph was locked up innocently are you there and by being locked up innocently into the prison god brought a burden of a prison ministry you gather then when he got into the prison his ministry was for two things to save some of them and some of them to be a judgment and a condemnation so when you go to your prison ministry you're going to preach the word some people will believe some will not believe but your sermon will be for condemnation that's what god will use it but he got to be locked up innocently to bring that burden everybody clear revelation 18 verse 7 jump to verse 16 and saying hellas hellas let's go to verse 15. the merchant of these things which were made reached by her shall stand a fire off for the fear of her determine whipping and wailing this is now naturally when she's gonna be destroyed the people will be sitting and watching her remember in revelation 17 there was a spiritual insight now it is on the natural when you look on the natural you don't see a beast with seven heads and ten horses that's not what you see you see something different verse 16 and saying allah says that great city that was clothed in water in the natural this woman have fine linen and fine linen means what the righteousness of water she has a form of godliness she can talk to you about church stuff but she will kill you young people she can talk to you about church stuff before you know it you're under fornication america young sister he can talk to you yes i believe god i believe the bible before you know it both of you under in a hotel in a bed amen then you're gonna see whether he's a christian or not everybody clear verse 16. that was cloth in fine land and camera and water purple costly array checked everybody clear on the board costly already come on and scarlet costlier checked everybody clear natural come on and deck with water everybody see this check camera it's your bible anybody clear come on deck with god and what precious stone and what all of this but if you notice brother branham don't talk about hell make sense because the breaded head that paul gave will not apply in the end timer make sense you need a ministry of brother brandon to point it to you if brother branham used the same word that peter and paul use peter and paul used the hair of the time so when brother pranam is describing a prostitute in the end time he doesn't use the terminology of peter and and and john paul because this is a different time this won't apply hallelujah jump to verse 23 and the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in you and the voice of the broad groom and of the blood shall be heard no more all in you for your merchant were the great man of the earth for by your sorcery that spirit sorcery where all the nations deceived and in her was found the blood of the water and of what and of all there that were slain upon the water she's a killer she's a prostitute she kills let's go back to proverbs 7. amen everybody okay blessed be the name of the lord proverbs 7. if you dare you can hold her amen now listen carefully because this is a different avenue you need your bible if you don't have your bible you can get lost easily you need your bible i insisted you need your bible if you don't have it you're going to get lost sooner nobody come and help me here they put the wrong way you need to be hooked there on the back anybody there a few people everybody there proverbs seven verse one my who we're not talking about a woman remember that he was the daughter of donna going out it is a woman in ezekiel paul spoke about a woman peter spoke about a woman now we're talking about a son that's why i say i wish all the young men were here dealing with a son watch now how the scripture move my son keep my words and lay up my commandment with you keep my commandment and do what and my law as the apple of your eyes bind them upon your fingers write them upon the table of your water heart say to who the first word is wisdom i want you to stay awake because it's a different avenue say to wisdom in the book of proverbs the virgin loves the king now it's a man it's a boy what is the boy going to do say to wisdom you are my water he didn't say brother cross wisdom your water sister when god speak about a woman in the book of the song of solomon he shifted he is a kingdom everybody when he begin to talk to man he shifted and he said call wisdom your sister he's not a homosexual okay say to wisdom you are my water and call understanding you are my water he's talking to a man called understanding you know what king's woman not king's men make sense here we got two words let me read a little bit that they may keep you from the strange water we have described to you a prostitute according to paul we describe to you a prostitute according to peter we describe to you a prostitute in the end time you follow me then solomon is saying to keep you from a prostitute i want you to call wisdom your sister and call understanding your king's woman or your ultimate friend in the book of the song of solomon amen the shunammite was a sister and a spouse to the kingdom here wisdom is a sister and a king's woman to a son we okay that they may keep you from the strange woman from the strange which flatter with her water we know who flatters with her word for at the window of my house i looked through my casement and i me head among the water simple mean naive you follow me this woman was a seal garden she was a virgin this son right here was a boy that is naive a voice that doesn't know sex you follow me okay i beheld among the simple ones the naive one they don't know anything yet they're more french to their mother the mom means bodies anybody clear a discern among the old people we are in teenager are designed among the who among the youth so this son is a teenager back again make sense are discerned among the youth a what a young man he's not an old man he's a young man which means he's on a teenage age makes sense now not a young woman a young man void of water he is first naive number two no understanding everybody here passing through the street near her corner who's here who is that strange woman a prostitute her corner and he went the way to her house anybody care let's stop here there is two words here one is wisdom the second is understanding what is the difference between the two are you there what is the difference between the two amen blessed be the name of the lord go to proverbs chapter 9 and we're gonna go back to chapter seven go to chapter nine if you're there you can say amen verse 10 are you there the fear of the lord is the beginning of what if you feel god it is just the beginning it gets yummy now you ready now are you okay you say yeah me brother stephen men shall not live by bread alone not your food but by every spiritual food that's why it's yummy he is spiritual so chill out anybody clear the fear of the lord is the beginning of what it is not wisdom yet but it's just the beginning of wisdom stay awake come on and knowledge of the holy is what so the knowledge of god is called water understanding brother stephen i still can't catch this follow me and buckle up you ready are you ready blessed be the name of the lord are you ready a few people come and help me here brother are you ready what is the difference between wisdom and understanding the word understanding means intelligence can you say amen the word understanding speaks of intelligence and it's also called the knowledge we just read it with you right the word understanding here deal with your spirit realm are you following me when you are born in this world in your head there is what we call a brain you follow me the brain is the software that god put in your body to help you contact the earth through the five senses amen james said that the body without the spirit is what in other words even if you are born if your spirit don't enter your body you'll be dead so when your spirit enters your body at birth everybody clear your spirit goes and unite with your brain do you follow me you follow me and begin to operate your brain as the as as the electricity into your computer everybody here do you follow me when you wear the stroke follow me your computer get damaged are you there but the electricity is still there you follow me you are still there but you are not able to communicate properly because part of your software is destroyed that person can talk to you but in order to use the brand to talk to you he cannot because part of the brain is damaged by stroke are you there but the knowledge he has the intelligence he have is still there do you follow me that is what understanding means lean not upon that understanding means lean not upon your entire intelligence lean not upon your intellect anybody following me now when it comes to wisdom wisdom is the body that is required for intelligence to operate chill out i told you it's a different avenue wisdom deal with the realm of the heart or the soul a living word we showed you a picture of a brain and of a heart are you there when we deal with wisdom wisdom comes from the heart follow me very carefully are you there understanding uses your brain you follow me but understanding without wisdom is deadly [Applause] [Music] hallelujah lord help me if you have not got love to accompany that what good does the sun do you god tried to do it across the nation but it would not work the greatest of all the gift is what even in the nine gift of the spirit the top one is wisdom follow me carefully at which the whole church was here are you there the second is water knowledge understanding you follow me hallelujah if you have not got knowledge you have not got wisnes a way of wisdom or if you have not got wisdom how to control your knowledge what is good your knowledge going to do do you follow me understanding comes from your brain if you deliver understanding with that veiling understanding by wisdom you you're gonna cause damage do you follow me do you follow me understanding look sister so and so wear a wrong dress if you deliver understanding understanding will say sister so-and-so why do you come with a wrong dress like this and it causes damage understanding must go through wisdom and wisdom will take understanding and give him the appropriate channel to uh to bring your message god bless you sister can i talk to you a little bit this is now understanding with wisdom how are you doing today i was doing good you know you're a lovely sister i love you a lot have you noticed i saw you moving over there but uh part of your clothing was oh i'm sorry daddy's understanding do you follow me you follow me when god spoke to israel when israel sinned israel won the sin god came and spoke to moses and said moses move up i'm going to start a new nation with you let me destroy israel completely are you there that is the supreme intelligence of god he want to bring judgment and destroy israel it was god that redeemed israel how does he want to destroy israel then moses enter and say if you want to touch israel you go ahead and kill me first are you there then god back up again and say ah it looks like moses is right are you there and brother branham used to wonder how can a man give god a better idea brother branham said no he was not moses he was christ in moses are you there intelligence wanna destroy but wisdom come and say this is not the way to do it do you follow me do you follow me that's why he came up and said i was the lord your god we send you a prophet like unto who and to moses he's the one that's gonna swallow that judgment are you there do you follow me do you follow me if you face god's strength you can get killed god have to veil himself into something in order to deal with you hallelujah the world is dying for love that is the fountain that god's got open the greatest of our gift that is in the local body if we put so much emphasis on speaking with tongue or interpretation and the first is water is that right the next is water how are you going to operate the knowledge when you have not got wisdom to operate with it if you got you have not got no wisdom you can operate your work if you have not got knowledge you won't know how to have water you need both of them my son you need wisdom and you need understanding you need understanding fail with wisdom what is wisdom pastor hallelujah go to proverbs 21. blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah wisdom versus understanding a lot of people have understanding can get you a job and it can get you fired amen amen understanding is right here it's your intellect you can graduate with a phd but you act like a maniac are you there proverbs 21 verse 22. if you dare you can say amen anybody there a water a wise man scared the city of the water and cast down the strength of the water so a man that is wise his wisdom is able to destroy a city of the mighty people what destroy is not the understanding the power is in the wisdom what is wisdom take ecclesiastic chapter now just give me a few minutes and i will let you go home and meditate on this this young man solomon say seek wisdom and seek understanding because those two will protect you from a harlot spiritually and naturally it will protect you from babylon and he also protects you from a natural woman let's go to ecclesiastes hallelujah if you there ecclesiastic i believe it follows proverb ecclesiastes chapter 9 if you dare you can hold on amen i already told you in this church bring your bible ecclesiastes 13 if you dare you can say amen this wisdom have a sin also under the sun and it seems water solomon said that there is a wisdom and notice on the earth and it's a great one what is the wisdom verse 14 there was a water look the city is very little i want to show you the power of wisdom okay there was a little city and few men inside so when you look at the city it's a small church when you look at the people they are not too many so by number and by natural force you can destroy them what is going to protect this city are you there and there came a great king against him poor city we are little city we don't have a lot of people in us we don't have a big army here comes a big army with a great king to destroy us so when you look at the scene automatically we are gone everybody clear come on and besiege it and built great book work against it verse 15 now there was found in it a water a poor man a poor water the man was poor but the man had wisdom follow me very carefully young people anybody clear and he by his intellect by his what by his wisdom delivered the city how can a small city with small men being delivered by wisdom not a shot a fight they didn't engage into a fight they just used wisdom and he brought the army down and delivered the city yet no man remember that same poor man verse 16. then say that wisdom is better than what anybody care if you can't wish them you can pull anybody down hallelujah come on nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised and his words are not heard the words of a wise man are heard in the in quiet more than cry more than the cry of him that rules among fools they make much noise verse 18 wisdom is better than what weapon of what but once sinners destroys much water your wisdom is a better weapon you can heaven you have wisdom you are deadly what is wisdom go to second samuel chapter 20. hallelujah the problem is when you open a chain and you open another one amen and you keep digging on the subterranean chambers everybody there second samuel chapter 20 if you're there you can say amen verse 1 and there happened to be there a man of belia a bad man a wicked man whose name was shiva the son of bakery a benjamin and he blew a trumpet and said we have no part in david neither have we inheritance in the son of jesse any man to his tent or israel a man rebel against david and say don't follow david anymore come out israel everybody go to their own place and everybody went to their own place job to verse six and david said to abisha now shashiba the son of bakery do us more harm than indeed absalom take you your lord servant and pursue after him lest he get him thanks city and escape us and then went out after him jawab's men and the keratite and the pelletile and all the mighty men and they went out of jerusalem to pursue after sheba the son of bakery david say follow after him because he causes a lot of damage just like absalom let's go to verse 13. everybody clear verse 13 and when he was removed out of the way all the people went after joab to pursue after sheba the son of bikri and he went through all the tribe of israel to abel and to bet uh makkah and all the buried and they were gathered together and went also after him and they came and besieged him in abil of bedmaker and they cast upon then they cast up a bank against the city and he stood in the trench and all the people that were with joab batted the wall to throw it down in other words they found the man he was inside the city and they came and joab said you know what we're going to destroy and wipe the city and kill this man
