[48:09] amen yeah this is a scripture that
[48:12] slipped me off
[48:14] completely and uh sister Angela sent me
[48:17] the scripture I don't see her this
[48:19] morning she sent me that she's in the
[48:22] back okay okay Wherever You Are amen she
[48:26] sent me the scripture and I was like my
[48:28] God how did I miss this and she was like
[48:32] brother Stephen look at this and this
[48:33] and this and this I say you don't know
[48:35] what you're doing actually the holy
[48:37] spirit is using you to remind me of
[48:40] something that I forgot amen and I
[48:43] really like it because I can see the
[48:44] working of the spirit through the church
[48:46] how it's working left and right that's
[48:49] wonderful we not in nicolan Era where
[48:52] the spirit work with the the preachers
[48:55] and not the congregation that's wrong
[48:57] that's right the spirit in this church
[48:59] work with
[49:00] everybody amen Genesis 21 verse uh 12
[49:06] you there you can say
[49:08] amen and the Bible says you know the
[49:10] background about this and God said to
[49:13] Abraham let it not be Grievous in your
[49:16] sight because of the Lord you know the
[49:18] story Sarah told Abraham kick ishma out
[49:23] amen and because of your bond woman and
[49:26] all that Sarah has said to you hearken
[49:30] to her voice amen amen for in Isaac
[49:35] shall your seed be C in other word the
[49:37] promise is not connected to Ishmael amen
[49:41] everything will come through Isaac so
[49:44] take is take him off from the home amen
[49:48] and also of the son of the Bor woman
[49:52] will I make a
[49:53] nation because he is your what SE you
[49:57] might be seated so we found out that
[50:00] Ishmael is not the son of the
[50:04] promise according to the scripture are
[50:07] we together but he's still the Seed of
[50:11] Abraham according to the promise of God
[50:14] if you look at the economy of God
[50:16] Ishmael is not
[50:17] there but Ishmael carries the Blood of
[50:22] Abraham so if you go get the DNA of
[50:25] ishma you check the DNA you find out
[50:27] that he came from Abraham but in the
[50:30] God's DNA according to the promise it's
[50:33] Isaac but it's not actually connected to
[50:37] Ishmael at all so the child have to
[50:39] leave and to be kicked out
[50:41] completely but look at
[50:43] this this is where I'm getting you verse
[50:47] 14 and Abraham rose up early in the
[50:50] morning and he took what
[50:54] bread
[50:57] we okay
[50:58] now he took bread because he doesn't
[51:02] want somebody to get hungry
[51:04] right
[51:06] right for
[51:09] Hunger but Rober can I get a new one
[51:12] please he took
[51:16] bread amen you know there is two
[51:19] essential things for living right it is
[51:22] bread and water water so Abraham must
[51:25] water right let's see the scripture the
[51:28] Bible says and Abraham rose up early in
[51:30] the morning and took what bread and a
[51:32] bottle of what water a true
[51:36] father bread and for
[51:41] thirst Abraham take
[51:45] H2O water a bottle of water and give it
[51:49] to
[51:50] hegar putting it on her
[51:52] shoulder there could be messages laying
[51:55] here but let me stay focused cuz if you
[51:58] trying to peel off this thing and we
[52:01] going Sid track
[52:03] amen and gave it to Hagar put it on her
[52:07] shoulder and the
[52:09] child and sent her way and she departed
[52:14] and wandered where in the wilderness why
[52:18] all these things happen only in the
[52:21] wilderness thank you
[52:23] amen she got water
[52:26] and she wander where in the wilderness
[52:29] in the
[52:30] wilderness in the
[52:33] desert
[52:34] so they both are covered because there
[52:38] is no food there is no water in the
[52:39] wilderness so they're covered amen let's
[52:43] see what happened in that
[52:44] Wilderness the Wilderness of Barba verse
[52:48] 15 and the water was spent in the bottle
[52:52] in other word the water is finished
[52:55] yeah amen amen and she cast the child
[53:00] under one of the shrub so something
[53:03] begin to happen to the child there is no
[53:06] more water brother Bram say that the
[53:10] tongue of Ishmael began to
[53:12] swell I have the quat if you want me I
[53:15] can give it to you no water the child
[53:18] begin to cry but remember this is not
[53:20] the child of a
[53:24] promise
[53:26] this is not a child of the
[53:28] promise God say do what Sarah did kick
[53:31] the child out but nevertheless in that
[53:34] child there is a Blood of
[53:38] Abraham we
[53:40] okay
[53:42] now the mother look at the baby the baby
[53:45] the child is crying the child is crying
[53:47] the child is about to die the mother say
[53:49] you know what I'm going to take him and
[53:50] find a little shra there and went and
[53:53] put the child there and live the child
[53:55] there to die because his tongue was
[53:57] already swelling brother Bram say
[53:59] something begin to happen with uh his
[54:01] lips and things because of thirst amen
[54:04] verse 16 and she went and sat her down
[54:08] opposite him a good way of as he were a
[54:11] bow shot for she said let me not see the
[54:15] death of what the child because Ismael
[54:17] was dying was dying because of thirst
[54:21] lack of water and mother say I'm not
[54:23] going to sit to watch my baby die ding
[54:25] let me drop him somewhere and run far
[54:28] away so when he dies there I do not keep
[54:31] the memory of this thing amen and uh
[54:35] verse 16 and she sat opposite him and
[54:38] lifted up her voice and did what we so
[54:42] Hagar was
[54:45] weeping
[54:47] Hagar was
[54:49] weeping when you look at this scripture
[54:53] like this you need a prophet
[54:55] amen actually she was
[54:59] crying she was not just weeping like
[55:01] that actually brother Bram say she was
[55:04] speaking certain
[55:07] things Hagar amen the bond Woman verse
[55:12] uh 17 and God heard the voice of Hagar
[55:23] no we okay now yes God heard the voice
[55:27] not the voice of
[55:29] Hagar God was not listening to the
[55:32] prayer of
[55:33] Hagar
[55:36] amen amen God heard the voice of who is
[55:42] is so the crying of Ishmael of
[55:47] thirst affected God
[55:50] Amen The Thirst of Ishmael pull God down
[55:55] yes
[55:56] amen
[55:58] amen not the thirst of hear Ishmael why
[56:03] only Ishmael and not Hagar God didn't
[56:07] say I'm looking at your weeping
[56:09] uh I'm hearing the lad over there so
[56:13] when that boy was crying over there
[56:16] something was in that boy that was
[56:19] reaching out
[56:22] heaven and God answered not Hagar
[56:26] brother Bram say before God mind Hagar
[56:29] he need to First respond to
[56:33] Ishmael we clear verse 17 and God heard
[56:37] the voice of the lad the voice of
[56:42] Ishmael amen when I say Ishmael we need
[56:47] to understand really who Ishmael is who
[56:50] is this God this child that God is
[56:53] attending to
[56:55] okay let's go slowly this way just keep
[56:59] your Bible right there let's go to
[57:01] Genesis
[57:03] 16 so we really get the
[57:08] picture Genesis 16 if you dare you can
[57:11] say amen
[57:14] amen let's see who is
[57:18] ishel verse
[57:20] 17 if you dare you can say Amen Hagar
[57:24] was pregnant with
[57:26] ishma and
[57:30] uh
[57:34] 16 let me
[57:36] see Genesis 16 verse 7 I'm sorry not 17
[57:42] verse 7
[57:44] m Hagar was pregnant with Ishmael she
[57:48] run
[57:50] away because Sarah was mistreating her
[57:54] and the Bible says in verse 7 and the
[57:57] angel of the Lord found
[57:59] her by a fountain of water in the what
[58:04] Wilderness this is
[58:06] Hagar by the way by the fountain in the
[58:09] way to Shore and he said the angel of
[58:12] the Lord hegar Sarah has made your
[58:16] position where you can where where came
[58:19] you and where will you go in other word
[58:22] where you going and she said I flee from
[58:25] the face of my mistress Sarah and the
[58:28] angel of the Lord said to her return to
[58:31] your
[58:32] mistress and do what submit thyself
[58:35] submit in other word obey submit
[58:37] yourself under her hand and the angel of
[58:40] the Lord say to her I will multiply your
[58:44] seed this is Ishmael
[58:48] exceedingly that he shall not be
[58:50] numbered for
[58:52] multitude we clear amen and the angel of
[58:56] the Lord said to her behold you are with
[58:59] with child and shall bear a son and
[59:02] shall call his name what Ismael because
[59:06] the Lord has heard your
[59:09] Affliction but verse 12 he will be a
[59:13] what a wild
[59:19] man he will be a wild man his hand will
[59:23] be against every man and every man's
[59:27] hand against him it's a troublemaker
[59:30] exactly
[59:32] right so that's why when he goes through
[59:34] trouble his system work
[59:37] fine his system always work with trouble
[59:43] wow I hope you're reading between the
[59:46] line and he shall dwell in the presence
[59:50] of all his what Brethren so let's go
[59:53] back now to our scripture on Genesis 21
[59:56] so we talking about a wild man a wild
[1:00:00] child who's not connected to the promise
[1:00:03] but when he's
[1:00:06] thirsting because he had the Blood of
[1:00:09] Abraham right God came down exct right
[1:00:14] thirst bringing God down God didn't come
[1:00:19] down until Ishmael begin to thirst and
[1:00:22] cry out for thirst amen
[1:00:25] amen
[1:00:26] amen jum to verse uh 17 and God heard
[1:00:31] the voice of the Lord and the angel of
[1:00:34] God this is God himself yes called to
[1:00:37] Hagar out of heaven and say to her what
[1:00:41] H you Hagar fear not for God has heard
[1:00:44] the voice of the L not the voice of
[1:00:47] Hagar where he
[1:00:50] is Aras lift up the Lord and hold him in
[1:00:54] your your hand for I will make him a
[1:00:56] what a great nation and God opened her
[1:01:01] eyes and she s a well of water and she
[1:01:06] went and filled the bottle with water
[1:01:09] and gave the Lord to drink brother Bram
[1:01:14] says that Hagar searched through this
[1:01:18] place and she didn't see any
[1:01:22] water in other word there was no water

[1:04:57] are more Abraham's seed than
[1:05:00] Ishmael because Ishmael is fighting
[1:05:03] Abraham's seed but we are praying for
[1:05:06] the Peace of
[1:05:07] Jerusalem we are not against the Jews we
[1:05:10] are for the Jews so if God can heal the
[1:05:14] enemy of the Jews and create a well for

[1:05:41] Jesus
[1:05:43] Christ amen The Thirst of Ishmael
[1:05:48] brought him a
[1:05:52] blessing are we together amen are we
[1:05:55] together let's go to Matthew 12 we read
[1:05:57] this last
[1:06:01] timeall so what happened to be a
[1:06:05] tragedy what happened to be like
[1:06:07] something bad that was happening to
[1:06:10] Israel was what was actually the key to
[1:06:15] bring the angel of the Lord down am so
[1:06:20] thirst in
[1:06:23] Ishmael
[1:06:24] amen brought God
[1:06:30] down amen and when God broke came down
[1:06:35] God
[1:06:42] created third
[1:06:45] four amen amen came by thirst remember
[1:06:51] we started thirst and hunger last week
[1:06:54] Matthew 12 just a refresh if you dare
[1:06:57] you can say Amen at that time Jesus went
[1:07:02] on the Sabbath day you understand this
[1:07:04] now yes through the corn you understand
[1:07:06] the laws now and his disciple were
[1:07:11] how The Hunger of the disciple on the
[1:07:15] Sabbath
[1:07:16] day the
[1:07:20] hunger of the disciple the followers of
[1:07:24] Jesus Christ
[1:07:26] amen and began to plug the ears of corn
[1:07:29] according to the law and to eat but when
[1:07:33] the Pharisees saw it they said to him
[1:07:37] behold your disciple do that which is
[1:07:40] not lawful to do upon the Water Sab day
[1:07:43] in other word they can go get the food
[1:07:45] but not on the Sabbath day but hunger
[1:07:48] doesn't look whether it's the Sabbath
[1:07:50] day or not the Sabbath day when you're
[1:07:52] hungry on the Sabbath day you
[1:07:54] hungry amen amen but he says to them
[1:07:59] have you not read what David did in
[1:08:02] other word what David did if Jesus is
[1:08:06] pulling this like this it means David
[1:08:09] did not
[1:08:10] sin that's right that's why brother Bram
[1:08:13] said Jonah was not outside of the will
[1:08:15] of God because Jesus would not have
[1:08:17] refer back to him and say the miracle of
[1:08:20] Jonah Amen in other words David what did
[1:08:24] was
[1:08:26] inspired because Jesus is using that to
[1:08:29] defend himself in other word if David
[1:08:32] never have done that the Pharisee would
[1:08:35] have cornered Jesus Christ and found him
[1:08:38] with a
[1:08:39] fault
[1:08:42] amen have you not heard what David did
[1:08:46] when he was hungry and they that were
[1:08:49] with him had he enter into the house of
[1:08:52] who God
[1:08:55] Y and did eat the what the showbread
[1:08:59] which was not lawful for him to do what
[1:09:03] eat this is Christ
[1:09:06] himself the hunger of David give him a
[1:09:10] right to eat something that doesn't
[1:09:11] belong to
[1:09:13] him amen no one has tasted that bread
[1:09:17] beside
[1:09:18] delived the first one from an another
[1:09:21] tribe that touched that bread is David
[1:09:24] and nothing happened to him and God
[1:09:26] doesn't kill him amen the hunger of
[1:09:29] David open him to the
[1:09:34] showbread without the hunger no
[1:09:37] showbread without the hunger not the
[1:09:39] sword of Goliath
[1:09:41] back amen hunger to
[1:09:47] David amen guide him the
[1:09:51] showbread and the sword
[1:09:57] amen it happened by
[1:10:00] hunger remember last week thirst and
[1:10:03] hunger are
[1:10:05] painful that's
[1:10:08] right painful what
[1:10:11] desire painful desire open up
[1:10:15] stuff amen that is not lawful for him to
[1:10:19] eat neither for them which were with him
[1:10:23] so not only David he opened the door for
[1:10:26] somebody else but only for the
[1:10:29] what hunger open this door not only to
[1:10:33] David but even to those that were
[1:10:36] following David and Jesus Christ
[1:10:38] entering the field because he's the
[1:10:41] master the lord of the Sabbath his
[1:10:43] disciple also become Lords of the
[1:10:46] Sabbath amen they can transgress the
[1:10:50] Sabbath and nothing
[1:10:51] happen amen what gave them their power
[1:10:55] it's hunger we clear let's go to Luke 15
[1:10:58] and then we
[1:11:00] CL Luke
[1:11:02] 15 very familiar scripture if you dare
[1:11:06] you can say amen
[1:11:08] amen Luke 15 verse
[1:11:17] 11 so we're going to pick up where we
[1:11:22] stop and see if we you can wind this up
[1:11:24] amen amen Luke
[1:11:27] 15:1 the Bible says a certain man has
[1:11:31] two son you know this there is a lot of
[1:11:34] type in this story there is Jews and 144
[1:11:37] Ty all of them he didn't hear amen and
[1:11:41] the younger of them say to his father
[1:11:45] father give me the portion of good that
[1:11:48] THS to me and he divided them he's
[1:11:52] living and not many days after the young
[1:11:55] son gathered all together and took his
[1:11:58] journey into a far country and there
[1:12:02] wasted his substance with righteous
[1:12:05] living amen and when he had spent all
[1:12:10] there arose a what a mighty famine not
[1:12:13] just a famine but it was a severe one a
[1:12:16] mighty famine in that land and he begin
[1:12:19] to be in water
[1:12:22] water so famine brought
[1:12:26] want
[1:12:29] famine brought want this want is called
[1:12:34] need amen the need that was generated
[1:12:38] from the famine and he begin to be in
[1:12:41] want and he went to join himself to a
[1:12:44] citizen of that country and he sent him
[1:12:47] into his field to do what feed swine and
[1:12:51] he would Fain in other word he would
[1:12:53] Glide L have filled his belly with the
[1:12:56] HK that the son that the swan did eat
[1:12:59] and no man gave to him and when he came
[1:13:03] to himself he didn't come to himself
[1:13:07] just like that
[1:13:08] no because all this time he was not
[1:13:11] coming back to himself when the famine
[1:13:14] started he didn't come to himself amen
[1:13:18] when he got the job he didn't come to
[1:13:20] himself when he was feeding the swan he
[1:13:22] didn't come to himself
[1:13:24] something happened to him that trigger a
[1:13:28] revelation we clear and when when he
[1:13:31] came to himself he said how many hired
[1:13:35] Servants of my fathers have what bread
[1:13:39] enough enough to spare and I perish with
[1:13:42] what hunger so what brought him that
[1:13:45] Revelation
[1:13:51] hunger fine brought need it brought
[1:13:55] hunger amen and hunger brought a
[1:14:01] revelation in other word hunger brought
[1:14:05] the mind of this boy
[1:14:09] back because the Bible say he came to
[1:14:12] himself so he was not
[1:14:17] himself the mind that he had first was
[1:14:20] lost so what brought him back to the
[1:14:24] man what Resto back
[1:14:28] theand is
[1:14:31] hunger and when he came back to himself
[1:14:34] he begin to think about his fathers and
[1:14:38] the potential that his father
[1:14:40] have he never thought about that when
[1:14:43] everything else was going
[1:14:45] on so hunger is a blessing to this
[1:14:50] boy just like hunger was a blessing to
[1:14:54] David just like thirst was a blessing to
[1:14:58] Ishmael amen that's right amen but we
[1:15:01] look at hunger in a different
[1:15:03] perspective amen the Bible says on verse
[1:15:07] uh uh 18 I will arise and go to my
[1:15:12] father so this hunger is bringing him
[1:15:16] back to the father because he he he cut
[1:15:19] off the relationship and he left his
[1:15:22] father he was separated from his father
[1:15:24] but this hunger is bringing him to a
[1:15:27] revelation that is restoring him
[1:15:33] back back to his
[1:15:38] father remember it took the famine to
[1:15:41] restore is uh I mean uh Egypt back to
[1:15:43] Pharaoh that's right you got it and I
[1:15:46] will arise and go back to my father and
[1:15:49] I will say to him who's teaching him

[1:16:27] Jesus verse 19 and I am no more worthy
[1:16:31] to be called your son make me as one of
[1:16:34] your highed water servants and he arose
[1:16:38] and came to his father but when he was
[1:16:41] yet a great way off his father saw him
[1:16:45] and had compassion and ran and fell on
[1:16:49] his neck and kissed him and the son said
[1:16:53] to him father he's repeating the
[1:16:55] Revelation he got through
[1:16:59] hunger he's repeating the Revelation he
[1:17:01] got through hunger he said father amen I
[1:17:05] have sinned against heaven and in your
[1:17:07] sight and I am no more worthy to call to
[1:17:10] be called your son but the father said

[1:20:24] amen
[1:20:26] amen and when his mind was back all
[1:20:30] these doors begin to open
[1:20:34] up why because of hunger quick one Luke
[1:20:39] verse 4 I'm just going to read this
[1:20:41] quickly Jesus being full of the Holy
[1:20:44] Ghost returned from Jordan and was led
[1:20:48] by the spirit where Into the Wilderness
[1:20:51] again the wilderness being 40 days
[1:20:54] tempted of the devil and in those day he
[1:20:56] did itat what nothing and when they were
[1:21:00] and when they were ended he after all
[1:21:02] did what hungry and the devil said to
[1:21:05] him if thou be the Son of God command
[1:21:08] this stone that he be made to what pray
[1:21:11] this power was available only after
[1:21:14] Jesus
[1:21:15] hungered we clear last one in Mark 11
[1:21:20] the Bible say and on the mor when they
[1:21:23] were come to Bethany he was how hungry
[1:21:25] so the third pull the power of the
[1:21:28] spoken word Came Upon Jesus Christ when
[1:21:30] he was hungry
[1:21:33] amen The Thirst of Ishmael brought the
[1:21:36] creative power The Thirst the hunger of
[1:21:39] David gave him access to the showbread
[1:21:41] and to the sword the feminine this boy
[1:21:44] did all this kind of stuff and even
[1:21:46] Jesus Christ himself only when he
[1:21:49] hungered that's when things happened
[1:21:52] what is is going on what are we talking
[1:21:54] about today my subject this morning is
[1:21:58] teach us to pray
[1:22:01] blessing through thirst and hunger amen
[1:22:06] when you begin to thirst about something
[1:22:08] am when you begin to really hunger amen
[1:22:12] am amen amen it is not a curse
[1:22:16] amen there is something that is coming
[1:22:19] up amen am am every body okay remember
[1:22:24] man is natural and man is also spiritual
[1:22:29] and we found out that man naturally
[1:22:32] hunger and thirst using the
[1:22:35] brain you remember that the hypot from
[1:22:39] last Sunday but spiritually speaking man
[1:22:43] when he hunger and thirst he does it by
[1:22:45] the soul amen that's what brother
[1:22:47] brandham say brother Bram say there is a
[1:22:50] thirst on the nature and there is a
[1:22:51] thirst on the the soul because man shall
[1:22:55] not live by bread alone but by every
[1:22:58] what word the word of God doesn't go to
[1:23:00] your belly amen the word of God doesn't
[1:23:04] go to your stomach the word of God goes
[1:23:07] into your soul amen it is the inside men
[1:23:10] that get fed by the word of God Amen
[1:23:12] everybody okay amen and we find out that
[1:23:15] we are still in the Lord's Prayer where
[1:23:17] the Bible says give us this day our
[1:23:21] daily bread or give us day by day our
[1:23:25] daily bread before you ask for bread you
[1:23:28] must be in
[1:23:31] need oh you must be in want amen you
[1:23:35] don't ask if you have it you ask because
[1:23:38] you don't have it amen so when we are
[1:23:42] going to the father and say give us this
[1:23:44] day our daily bread we don't want to
[1:23:47] fall in other words it is hunger that is
[1:23:50] pushing us back to the father amen
[1:23:52] everybody clear so far according to the
[1:23:56] Book of
[1:23:57] James verse one chapter 1 verse 17 the
[1:24:01] Bible says that every good gift and
[1:24:05] every perfect gift is from who above and
[1:24:09] cometh down from the who father of light
[1:24:12] the father of light he's the father of
[1:24:15] light he's a father of light if he is a
[1:24:18] father that generate light he himself
[1:24:20] must be a light amen
[1:24:24] amen the Bible says in 1 John
[1:24:27] 1:5 this then is the message which we
[1:24:31] have heard of him and declare unto you
[1:24:34] that God is what
[1:24:36] light that's why he's the father of
[1:24:38] light and the in the Book of Revelation
[1:24:41] 21 the Bible says the city has no need
[1:24:44] of the son neither of the moon to shine
[1:24:47] in it for the glory of God did lighten
[1:24:51] it and the L L is the what so the lamb
[1:24:55] is the light God is light and he is the
[1:24:58] father of light amen he's the father of
[1:25:01] your theophany amen because he himself
[1:25:05] is a theophany he is the Loos he is the
[1:25:09] pillar of fire am that's why on the day
[1:25:12] of Pentecost when the disciple wanted to
[1:25:15] get the new birth the pillar of fire
[1:25:17] separated himself into 120 light he was
[1:25:22] the father of light he was the one
[1:25:25] giving birth to new lights everybody
[1:25:28] clear but my point I want you to keep
[1:25:30] here is every good gift every perfect
[1:25:33] gift come from who from God we clear
[1:25:37] amen now we went through this in Matthew
[1:25:39] 7: 7 the bible say ask uhhuh and it
[1:25:44] shall be what given you before you ask
[1:25:47] you must be in need amen amen are we
[1:25:51] together amen seek and you shall find
[1:25:54] what do you seek if you already found
[1:25:56] something so when you seeking it means
[1:25:58] you don't have it
[1:25:59] amen are we together yes sir knock and
[1:26:02] it shall be open to you why do you knock
[1:26:05] because you are looking for something
[1:26:07] amen everybody okay amen for everyone
[1:26:11] that do what ask it he does what receive
[1:26:14] it so your asking is only an expression
[1:26:18] of the need that you have amen you
[1:26:21] already have a need that's the reason
[1:26:23] why you
[1:26:24] ask are we together you are after
[1:26:28] something that's the reason why you
[1:26:29] seeking you want something that's the
[1:26:32] reason why you knocking everybody okay
[1:26:35] everyone that ask receiveth and he that
[1:26:38] seeketh do what find it and to him that
[1:26:40] knth it shall be how open and Jesus say
[1:26:44] or what man is there of you whom if his
[1:26:48] son ask for what

[1:39:54] through
[1:39:55] hunger amen amen praise be to the name
[1:39:59] of the Lord act chapter 10 very familiar
[1:40:03] story if you there you can say amen
[1:40:08] amen verse
[1:40:10] 9 on the tomorrow as they went on their
[1:40:14] Journey God met the angel of the Lord
[1:40:17] came and talked to
[1:40:18] Cornelius and say your prayer are answer
[1:40:21] and everything go send and go get Peter
[1:40:24] and bring Peter to your home amen verse
[1:40:27] 9 on the tomorrow as they went on their
[1:40:30] journey and Drew near the city they were
[1:40:34] going to get Peter Peter went up where
[1:40:38] upon the Housetop to do what pray to
[1:40:41] pray about the what the sixth hour we
[1:40:44] clear verse 10 and he became how very
[1:40:49] hungry is my Bible different than yours
[1:40:52] sir why are this thing happen when
[1:40:54] people are
[1:40:56] hungry I'm reading the Bible when David
[1:40:59] was hungry something happened when Jesus
[1:41:02] was hungry something happened when Jesus
[1:41:04] was hungry in the wilderness something
[1:41:06] was happened when Ismael is thirsty
[1:41:08] something is happened now Peter is very
[1:41:11] hungry very
[1:41:14] hry
[1:41:17] amen and he became how very hungry verse
[1:41:22] 10 and would have what e but while they
[1:41:26] make ready he did what he fell into a
[1:41:29] the vision never came to Peter until he
[1:41:34] begin to
[1:41:37] hunger I don't know if you're getting
[1:41:39] what I'm saying that's why fasting
[1:41:42] sometime open up
[1:41:46] [Applause]
[1:41:49] doors right there everybody okay
[1:41:52] everybody okay because when God took
[1:41:55] opportunity not when Peter was F only
[1:41:58] when Peter begin to hunger that's when
[1:42:01] the Holy Spirit came to give him a
[1:42:04] message only when he was
[1:42:08] hungry
[1:42:11] amen verse 11 if you thereare you can
[1:42:14] say amen amen and so how Heaven open he
[1:42:18] saw heaven open when he was hungry For
[1:42:21] the First Time Peter is seeing Heaven
[1:42:24] open through hunger Hallelujah he see
[1:42:27] Heaven open and a certain water vessel
[1:42:30] descending to him as he had been a great
[1:42:32] sheet knit at the Four Corners and let
[1:42:35] down to the Earth wherein were what all
[1:42:38] manner of four-footed beasts of the
[1:42:40] earth and wild beasts and creeping
[1:42:42] things and what vows of the air and
[1:42:44] there came a voice to him rise Peter and
[1:42:47] do what kill and eat but Peter said not
[1:42:50] so Lord for I have never eaten anything
[1:42:53] that is what common or what and the
[1:42:56] voice spoke to him again the second time
[1:42:58] what God has cleansed th call not what
[1:43:01] Thou come God used the hunger of Peter
[1:43:05] to break a tradition from
[1:43:10] Peter because the Commandment of Jesus
[1:43:13] Christ was nobody can preach to the
[1:43:16] Gentile but Peter was given the keys
[1:43:20] amen because Jesus told him that he gave
[1:43:22] him the key and on the day of Pentecost
[1:43:25] he was the first one to preach the
[1:43:27] gospel now who's going to bring the
[1:43:29] gospel to the Gentile he must be Peter
[1:43:32] but Jesus Christ locked the door Lo but
[1:43:35] to open the door to the
[1:43:37] Gentile P must be
[1:43:41] hungry and God used his hunger to break
[1:43:45] to give him a revelation about you and
[1:43:48] me so that the Holy G ghost can come to
[1:43:51] you and me without the laying on
[1:43:54] [Applause]
[1:43:57] hand
[1:43:59] huah are you following me yes are we
[1:44:02] together jump to verse 24 glory to God
[1:44:06] the Bible says and the tomorrow after
[1:44:09] they enter what into cesaria they they
[1:44:12] already got Peter they went with Peter
[1:44:14] to the house of Cornelius and Cornelius
[1:44:16] was doing what waited for them Cornelius

[1:45:27] thing for a man that is what a Jew to
[1:45:30] keep what company or come to one that is
[1:45:33] what another Nation but God has shown me
[1:45:36] when I was hungry that I should not call
[1:45:39] any man how coming or what clean
[1:45:42] therefore came out to you without again
[1:45:45] saying as soon as I was sent for I asked
[1:45:48] therefore For What in 10 you have sent
[1:45:52] me in other word why did you send me why
[1:45:54] why did you call for me watch verse 30
[1:45:57] and Cornelius say 4 days ago I was doing
[1:46:01] what all right now so the angel of the
[1:46:05] Lord came to P to to Cornelius after
[1:46:11] what after what after FAS thing the
[1:46:15] angel of the Lord drop

[1:46:27] until the what hour and at the 9 hour I
[1:46:30] pray in my house and behold the water
[1:46:32] amen so when did the angel come after he
[1:46:35] finish his
[1:46:38] fasting we clear and brother Bram told
[1:46:41] us when you finish your fasting what
[1:46:43] happened how do you know you finish your
[1:46:45] fasting when you begin to do what
[1:46:48] hry that's when the angel came amen and
[1:46:51] the choice the vision came to Peter when
[1:46:54] he was hungry hungry
[1:46:57] hunger in these two cases is creating
[1:47:01] expectation that's right praise God amen
[1:47:05] amen let's go quickly to verse uh
[1:47:11] uh let me go to verse 33 for time
[1:47:15] immediately therefore I send to you and
[1:47:18] you have well done that you are come
[1:47:21] now therefore are we all here what
[1:47:24] present before who God to hear what all
[1:47:28] things everything that are commanded you
[1:47:31] of what God in other word we are sitting
[1:47:34] right here we are waiting we want you to
[1:47:36] speak we are already under expect we are
[1:47:40] hungry we want you to speak we are
[1:47:42] already expecting and because of that
[1:47:46] hunger the Holy Spirit never waited for
[1:47:49] Peter to finish the
[1:47:52] sermon Glory Glory brother say because
[1:47:55] they were already ready ready how
[1:47:57] hungering for God and the Holy Spirit
[1:48:00] automatically came down what are you
[1:48:03] trying to say brother Steven brother
[1:48:05] Bram say that's right no what waiting no
[1:48:08] what teing the apostolic way God has no
[1:48:11] what set R when the heart is H hungry he
[1:48:15] shall give you what what hungering for
[1:48:18] if you want the Holy Ghost he can fall
[1:48:20] on you when right
[1:48:21] now so the key to receive the Holy
[1:48:24] Spirit you must hunger amen you must
[1:48:27] thirst after it and if you really me it
[1:48:30] it will pull the Holy Spirit toward you
[1:48:34] amen are we together am praise be to the
[1:48:37] name of the Lord the brother brandham
[1:48:40] says this you know when real faith
[1:48:43] strick into a heart they begin to do
[1:48:46] what hunger
[1:48:49] am amen let's read it again you know
[1:48:53] when real faith strick into their heart
[1:48:55] they begin to do what hunger so when you
[1:48:59] hungering by the soul it is an
[1:49:02] expression of Faith
[1:49:05] [Applause]
[1:49:07] amen there is a big trouble in this
[1:49:10] message that we don't understand what
[1:49:13] really faith is we have been taught so
[1:49:16] much about faith but we really don't
[1:49:19] understand faith is but what I'm trying
[1:49:22] to make you understand is Faith is
[1:49:25] different than what you think the hunger
[1:49:28] that you feel toward something all the
[1:49:31] thirst that you feel towards something
[1:49:33] it is actually
[1:49:35] Faith that's the reason why he have the
[1:49:39] potential to pull that thing towards you
[1:49:42] it is not your desire it is Faith
[1:49:45] pulling what Belong To You toward
[1:49:48] you am amen

[1:49:54] saying I'm going to show you what
[1:49:56] brother brandham says but we know when
[1:49:58] real Faith struck Into the Heart they
[1:50:01] begin to do what hunger and they want to

[1:50:10] what getting Hunger and what thirsting
[1:50:13] for God he shall receive it amen amen
[1:50:18] the trouble of it is that the church is
[1:50:21] now what hungry
[1:50:24] enough hungry enough to what for who
[1:50:28] God is the reason the holy spirit is now
[1:50:32] moving into the church tonight that's

[1:56:26] that brother BR say if there is if there
[1:56:29] was no Bible to tell us so still it
[1:56:33] would have to be a what a reality
[1:56:37] because there is something in you that a
[1:56:40] what a creator has what has created amen
[1:56:44] and before they can be a what that's
[1:56:47] what I was getting to you they there has
[1:56:49] to be something to do what to fulfill
[1:56:53] that desire did you ever have something
[1:56:56] you were hungering for and you just
[1:56:59] could not get the taste of it after a
[1:57:02] while you got
[1:57:07] iten I want you to read can you read it
[1:57:09] over my friend um from did you ever go
[1:57:13] ahead uhhuh did you ever have something

[1:57:19] just couldn't get the taste of it and
[1:57:21] you just could not get the taste of it
[1:57:24] and after what what you got it in other
[1:57:26] words you were Desiring something and
[1:57:28] you knew it was impossible for you to
[1:57:30] reach it and even sometime you even try
[1:57:33] you say you know what I I will never
[1:57:35] reach your I will never get something
[1:57:38] like this and after a few years you
[1:57:40] begin to have what you thought you
[1:57:42] cannot
[1:57:45] qualify
[1:57:48] sir
[1:57:51] [Applause]
[1:57:57] let me explain to you
[1:57:58] this have you ever look at something and
[1:58:01] you look you say I cannot afford
[1:58:07] it can you check somebody else
[1:58:12] [Applause]
[1:58:15] hand
[1:58:17] Hallelujah come on
[1:58:22] Jesus so we can drop this thing very
[1:58:26] good amen amen amen have you ever
[1:58:31] watched few years in your
[1:58:33] [Music]
[1:58:34] life amen let me just take an example
[1:58:37] okay I'm taking an example you look at
[1:58:40] the house and you and you look and you
[1:58:43] ask the price and they say this is the
[1:58:45] price you say no we cannot afford it and
[1:58:47] after 2 years you found out you are are
[1:58:49] living in the
[1:58:51] house how did you get in the
[1:58:55] house because at the beginning you say
[1:58:58] you cannot afford it at the beginning
[1:59:01] when you are looking you say no this is
[1:59:03] something I cannot reach this is for so
[1:59:06] and so but not for me I don't qualify
[1:59:09] for it only takes it few years and you
[1:59:12] begin to justess like brother
[1:59:17] Steven and at the beginning you thought
[1:59:20] brother Steven was
[1:59:22] higher have you ever thought about it
[1:59:26] what was pushing you to touch for
[1:59:28] [Applause]
[1:59:32] that I took myself as an example so I
[1:59:35] don't get anybody in trouble amen amen
[1:59:37] have you ever thought
[1:59:40] that when you get to the store you go to
[1:59:43] certain section and you avoiding those
[1:59:45] section you say we cannot go to that
[1:59:47] section we need to go to this section
[1:59:49] and after a few years you don't even
[1:59:51] realize that you already getting into
[1:59:54] those section and you don't know how it
[1:59:56] happened this is what brother Bram is
[1:59:58] saying here he says that did you ever
[2:00:01] have something you were hungering for
[2:00:04] and you just could not get the what the
[2:00:06] taste of it and after a while you do
[2:00:08] what you got it it seems like something
[2:00:10] happened out of somewhere you got it how
[2:00:12] did you got it because the one that was
[2:00:15] creating that was not true am it was God
[2:00:19] creating that in you
[2:00:22] amen and because he was God God must
[2:00:25] bring it to pass uh hallelujah
[2:00:29] hallelujah because he was faith in
[2:00:33] disgust in other word your desire was
[2:00:37] only a faith
[2:00:43] Amen in other word that hunger was only
[2:00:47] an indication
[2:00:49] that God is telling you what you
[2:00:53] qualify but your cor of thinking was
[2:00:57] fighting over it like I do not qualify
[2:01:01] when God is telling you this is what I'm
[2:01:03] showing
[2:01:05] [Applause]
[2:01:08] you father help me

[2:01:23] this is Brother BR I'm asking not me the
[2:01:26] power of w God thank you look before
[2:01:30] they can be a creation there has to be a
[2:01:34] Creator to create what that creation is
[2:01:37] that right well as long as you are
[2:01:40] hungering for what Divine Healing and
[2:01:43] the what power of God there's got to be
[2:01:46] a what a fountain open somewhere is that
[2:01:49] right if there is not Divine Healing you
[2:01:52] will not have that in your heart amen
[2:01:56] hallelujah in other word what you
[2:01:59] hungering is telling you it's
[2:02:02] existed if it was not existed you will
[2:02:06] not have hunger for
[2:02:12] it spoken word what is your message do

[2:02:19] do not beler your cting
[2:02:25] amen whatever your heart is bringing up
[2:02:29] you need to embrace it because it's God
[2:02:33] indicating you
[2:02:36] [Applause]
[2:02:39] something yes sir yes sir let me let me
[2:02:42] go I'm going with simple things am okay
[2:02:46] because when we go this right people
[2:02:47] would say he's talking about material
[2:02:49] things all the time but I have to go
[2:02:52] that way so you understand amen am amen
[2:02:55] amen have you ever thought about buying
[2:02:57] an
[2:02:59] airplane he won't come to your mind
[2:03:01] right he won't come to your mind right
[2:03:04] right it won't come to your mind but if
[2:03:06] you go to somebody else they have that
[2:03:08] in their mind that's and when they talk
[2:03:12] to you you will see them crazy you will
[2:03:15] see them like the pride no it's the way
[2:03:17] God built them
[2:03:25] you can talk to somebody that I want you
[2:03:27] to live in the city they say no we don't
[2:03:29] want to live in the city I love to live
[2:03:31] in the country over there that's the way
[2:03:33] they were built and their heart will
[2:03:36] begin to pull something toward the
[2:03:43] country and you will find out then we
[2:03:45] end up buying a house in the
[2:03:47] country in other words that t will
[2:03:50] create that
[2:03:54] house and that t will Evacuate the the
[2:03:59] the the tenant that is there for some
[2:04:02] reason that tenant will sell that home
[2:04:05] because somebody's looking for that
[2:04:13] home amen because the reason why I ask
[2:04:17] you airplane is to show you that there
[2:04:20] are many thing that never cross your
[2:04:21] mind because they don't probably belong
[2:04:24] to you or maybe it's not your time yet
[2:04:27] but when the time begin to draw near
[2:04:29] then they begin to come don't be little
[2:04:34] it because if there was none of them
[2:04:37] there you would not have thirst for it
[2:04:40] the reason why you thirsting for it is
[2:04:43] because it's
[2:04:45] [Applause]
[2:04:46] there the reason why you are going to

[2:05:23] way if there is not Divine Healing you
[2:05:27] will not have that in your what heart so
[2:05:29] if you have it it means it's there the
[2:05:32] Creator God has to do what create in

[2:05:38] think of such a thing so when you
[2:05:40] thinking of

[2:06:36] thinking what I'm

[2:08:38] heart what am I trying to say the
[2:08:40] craving of your heart is a very proof
[2:08:44] that whatever you are craving is already

[2:44:46] God is dealing with your heart we are
[2:44:49] not just a church we are the BR of Jesus
[2:44:52] Christ and God is whispering things to
[2:44:55] his
[2:44:57] brother don't look at who in your family
[2:45:00] is the first one who is the last one
[2:45:03] don't look at who have accomplished this
[2:45:05] in church first that's not your problem
[2:45:07] don't look at who did this in the
[2:45:09] message that's not your problem look at
[2:45:11] yourself and God God will do something
[2:45:15] with you that he can do with you only
[2:45:18] there is one Moses to deliver Israel
[2:45:21] it's Moses and it's going to be Moses
[2:45:26] period if it's David it's David period
[2:45:30] he had big brother God left the big
[2:45:31] brother and went straight to him use
[2:45:34] what God is telling you if David would
[2:45:36] have stopped and say huh if I do
[2:45:39] something here they would say that I'm
[2:45:40] trying to show up let me just leave it
[2:45:41] alone he would have missed his
[2:45:44] opportunity amen amen David thought he
[2:45:47] was going to the battle to give food
[2:45:51] that's what he thought he was bringing
[2:45:52] food he didn't know he's going into
[2:45:55] something amen wake up my
[2:45:59] friend it is not just a simple thought
[2:46:03] before that thought was there God
[2:46:05] created let's
[2:46:08] [Applause]
[2:46:14] stand
[2:46:15] [Applause]
[2:46:28] Hallelujah I don't know what the Lord
[2:46:30] put in your
[2:46:31] heart I don't know what has been
[2:46:33] troubling
[2:46:36] you that's why it's important to stay
[2:46:39] away from distraction
[2:46:41] that's because the enemy put all the
[2:46:44] social media on you so that your mind is
[2:46:47] constantly bombarded with something else
[2:46:50] and you don't listen to the thoughts of
[2:46:52] God when they are pading your
[2:46:55] mind amen get some quiet time and
[2:46:58] meditate on him and you will begin to
[2:47:01] see things than because it's God
[2:47:07] language you go through a situation
[2:47:10] tight and suddenly it's like an nidea
[2:47:13] spark Clap That doesn't come like that
[2:47:17] it is God
[2:47:18] whispering but we got used to the movie
[2:47:22] where we think God is a big voice that
[2:47:24] say Abraham Abraham that's what we are
[2:47:27] waiting
[2:47:28] for and we miss
[2:47:31] God God is very
[2:47:33] simple those four lepers would have
[2:47:36] blocked the entire change of their life
[2:47:39] they could have stayed leper the
[2:47:43] entire life right but that opportunity
[2:47:47] changed their life they were not just
[2:47:50] leper normal leper they were Leopard
[2:47:52] with silver and
[2:47:54] gold with Remnant and all this kind of
[2:47:57] stuff and they become hero until they
[2:48:00] put them in the Bible and we begin to
[2:48:03] read them and they become part of the
[2:48:05] word of God am they didn't look at their
[2:48:08] condition and say we are leopard we
[2:48:11] don't qualify in Israel we already
[2:48:14] reject said according to the Lord that's
[2:48:16] why we stand outside of the city amen if
[2:48:18] God want to use somebody he would have
[2:48:20] used somebody in the city not us they
[2:48:22] didn't look at that break your complexes
[2:48:26] no matter situation that you went
[2:48:27] through or where you were or what
[2:48:29] happened to your life that you got into
[2:48:31] a certain situation that are stuck with
[2:48:33] you break that away it doesn't stop God
[2:48:37] from working with you it would not block
[2:48:40] God from accessing you amen if RAB did
[2:48:45] not move with the possession of her
[2:48:47] heart she would have died with her
[2:48:49] entire family she Follow by
[2:48:53] faith and she saved her entire family
[2:48:56] and she saved herself because Rahab
[2:49:00] operated with what came up it was a risk
[2:49:03] for her yes he almost cost her life but
[2:49:06] he saved her and put her
[2:49:09] here and before she goes she said give
[2:49:11] me a true token that's right in other
[2:49:13] way you're not going like this
[2:49:15] who told her when they give you the
[2:49:17] Scarlet tra they're going to save
[2:49:18] you why didn't the coming down of the
[2:49:22] wall bring down her house can a Scarlet
[2:49:25] thread protect the building what kind of
[2:49:28] protection is that one who was
[2:49:30] protecting the building just a little
[2:49:32] thread that was hanging on like this can
[2:49:35] protect the
[2:49:37] building so the little act that you're
[2:49:39] doing it's pulling almighty God there
[2:49:42] let's pray heavenly father thank you
[2:49:44] Lord
[2:49:45] Lord we approaching you humbly this
[2:49:47] afternoon father once again we thank you
[2:49:50] for your grace for your love and for
[2:49:53] your mercy and for revealing yourself in
[2:49:58] Simplicity father I've been in this
[2:50:01] message for a while and I heard the talk
[2:50:04] of the people before even I became a
[2:50:07] pastor we heard many sermon until we got
[2:50:12] so confused about the operation of the
[2:50:16] gift about the way you deal with your
[2:50:19] children and this is what was the cause
[2:50:22] of so much confusion about the evidence
[2:50:25] of the holy spirit because some testify
[2:50:29] that they roll on the floor some testify
[2:50:33] that they spoke in tongue some testify
[2:50:36] that A Light Came Upon them some felt
[2:50:39] this and that and other don't feel
[2:50:41] nothing until they don't know whether
[2:50:43] they got the holy ho Spirit or not
[2:50:45] they're not even sure whether you deal
[2:50:48] with them or not because ad have
[2:50:50] testified to see a vision or to see an
[2:50:53] angel but they have never received any
[2:50:55] encounter in their life but father you
[2:50:58] brought us back to the common
[2:51:00] denominator which is the word of God
[2:51:03] that heaven and earth may pass away but
[2:51:06] your word is will never pass away and
[2:51:08] now you are bringing your children to
[2:51:11] the very
[2:51:13] Simplicity of the gospel of a Christian
[2:51:16] Life and walk so that they can be
[2:51:19] aware that you are always there and you
[2:51:22] even mind the very little thing in their
[2:51:25] life father may you give us this
[2:51:28] alertness of the spirit so that we can
[2:51:31] seize Our Moment so that we can seize
[2:51:35] our possession so that we can seize our
[2:51:39] opportunity that little SP of moment
[2:51:43] that you send an information
[2:51:45] to take us from a bad situation into a
[2:51:48] complete and total Deliverance Lord we
[2:51:52] spoke here and there but you the great
[2:51:54] teacher may you take what was spoken
[2:51:57] Lord and put them together and continue
[2:52:00] to unfold your word to your children so
[2:52:02] that they can realize that all this time
[2:52:06] you have been working in their life and
[2:52:08] they were not just being aware of it and
[2:52:10] now that you brought this to light Lord
[2:52:13] may we become more aware
[2:52:15] and more sensitive of the spirit so that
[2:52:17] we can see your glory in this year 2024
[2:52:21] and be delivered completely from all our
[2:52:24] trouble we thank you and commit
[2:52:26] everything unto the hand may you
[2:52:28] continue to bless and protect them Lord
[2:52:31] in the name of Jesus Christ amen God
[2:52:35] bless you church we love you brother
