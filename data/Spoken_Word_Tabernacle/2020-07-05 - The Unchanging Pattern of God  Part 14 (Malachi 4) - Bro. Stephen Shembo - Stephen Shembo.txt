a few minutes we're not gonna take too long just to give a briefing of where we are and where we are today oblation this morning what Amore's would you adjust this light for me it's a way you can make it brighter it's already max okay no problem everything okay brother Marcus is he working now the camera was waiting on the pastor praise the Lord yeah just like everybody knows we have a pastor now and he's the one standing in front of you talking his name is brother Steven you want to praise the Lord and as we mentioned the pastor is only one man there is no way I can carry this job myself we have brothers and sister here and we have many brothers and sister also that are online so if everything comes back to normal and everybody is here you're gonna see that it's a big church so a big church big Souls good people and we need to make sure we do everything according to the with Hema I have my cpa I have my lawyer I have my mentors I have mentors in the industry and this and this and this I am surrounded with a team that helped me do what I do but this is not my job this is not my business this is the Lord job and this is the Lord's business so I cannot bring my team to work with me here I need to go with the team that the Holy Spirit have provided for his own church brother Branham says this he says that we believe in church government everybody clear so it's not the political policies and government it's a church government he's and the government is ordered of the Holy Spirit in the Bible so our government have a foundation in the scripture he doesn't have a foundation in the Constitution of the United States or any other countries Constitution it is funded in the scripture meaning we have a deacon we have trustees we have song leaders we have treasure we have Sunday School Superintendent all these are the government that have been put in place for God to equip his church in order to move forward in right direction and what a Branham say the government is ordered of the Holy Spirit in the Bible they say the pastor is always the head of the church the pastor is always that God's elder in organization not here Assad in organization you have to come through the bishop we don't have a bishop here we only have a pastor we will have a higher headquarter the higher headquarter is the Holy Spirit Weimar consult with the brother if we have question but every church is sovereign so there is no higher order in the Bible than the elder of the church just tell me where where it is it there is no higher order in the Bible for the church the elder will cheese the pasta the highest order of the bubble so what I'm trying to draw here is there is a government for the church and that government has been established by the Holy Spirit and we have to follow what the Prophet have stated so a second coat here just to get to what I'm about to say brother Branham say look the way we used to do it years ago he says sister Gerty was the pianist when I pastored here so brother Branham was a pastor as well but random saying when I pastored here I had to be pastor deacon trustee everything else at once see but I had to do it but a Branham start a church from scratch but a Branham had to preach people bring the people from the street all the way to the church this is not the way this church started this church we didn't preach anybody here to receive the Lord Jesus Christ and to come here and then to believe the message of the hour this church started with believer who took a standard took a position for the message of the hour so it's just a fragment that have been detached from living word Tabernacle and that took everything together so brother Steven are you going to be the trustee are you going to be the deacon are you going to be doing everything no because I have not started a church from scratch everybody clear so far H but what a Branham say now we don't have to do it that way why he said because you got men to carry this out in other world have to be a pastor a deacon and do everything at once and we have brothers we have sisters here we have men that are already mature in the world we have men die have the Holy Spirit we have men that are already establishing the Word of God that can carry this job there for a to be a pastor deacon pastor trustee pastor decent ease and gesture but we needed men to carry this job now brother Branham when he continued he said but when day I had ashes he didn't say Deacon because Deacon need to be voted him and voted in by the church what about him say that I had asher's brought a c-word and all of them at the door they had books parlor on there at the door setting in the chair or something another and when someone come in you show them a place to hang your coat and help them to their seat give them a songbook and ask them to be in prayer in other word the Asscher is a temporary deacon the Asscher and the job of a deacon is pretty much the same but a deacon is somebody who is voted by the church but an usher is a person that has been a poor Church sanctioned that person then that person will be a deacon everybody clear so far and what random say that and then everybody set in their seat and silently prayed until studying tom so we have a pastor but we need brothers to carry this job so those brothers are going to be Usher's first and then we need to give the church time to move on stay in prayer until we see an usher can be put up today and tomorrow he can be changed there is no problem but a deacon once he is elected if you want to remove a deacon we must give an explanation to the church why the deacon have been removed everybody clear we can now remove a deacon just like that if you remove a deacon you need to come back to the church and give the church explanation why the Deacon was removed and that explanation must be clear in the scripture it's not going to be because the pastor doesn't like the difference because the deacon was not appointed by the pastor the deacon was appointed by the congregation so you must convince the congregation that I'm removing this deacon because of this dis dis dis dis and then we go if the explanation is not valid the Deacon is tear into position everybody clear so far so before we get to deacon there is a step where we're gonna take is Usher so I asked two brothers I know we might have four deacons we might have three deacons we might have two deacons but at this point we need to go with two and those brothers were brother Robert Fabi who is here and I also asked brother Abel who's right here working on a computer so before we go into deep deep into this song leader is not voted and song leader is appointed so basically for his church as a pastor as a felid brother John Porter is our song leader so brother John Porter will be the one leading the song here but brother John Porter had backup just in case he's sick he's not feeling good we have brother Abel who's an usher who has been leading our song on Wednesday those who have been on a youtube you seen him and we also have brother Robert Fabi who also layered our song in Living Word Tabernacle those two Usher's can back brother John Porter as song leader everybody clear so far no so now we transfer pretty much everything and we thank God for the cooperation of brother Maurice helping us through the entire process of transferring and getting everything but to us now brother Stephen D a sure we understand it you're going to have Asher's it's going to be brother Robert and brother Abel what about the money part are you going to be the trustee handling the money or what because we know that they test belong to the pastor so before I get into that I'm going to give you the account of what we receive from the committee what I found into the offering account and what I found into the task on this is your one time report the only report of my goes into the church is the Sunday School offering but as far as the account whoever is going to be trustee whoever is going to be a treasure there will be the one handling the account I believe in that because brother Branham say trustee are the one who is possible for the finances I have caught after coat but later on we might clarify on these things little by little five thousand six hundred sixty five dollars and 22 cents that's what we are starting with clear so far in the task they count what we receive after the transfer was fifty two thousand five hundred forty seven dollars and twenty five cents that's where I am and that's what we're going to be starting with now brother Steven are you going to be using your tot money at this point no because we need a building we need a church it is the truth brother Branham say tat belong to the pastor but God has blessed me with a job that I can take care of myself without touching this money so I would dedicate that money completely entirely to find either a spot or a church and handle that so whatever will be coming into the tithing or this time until we get into the building will be completely dedicated for the building so if you pay your tab today or tomorrow or after tomorrow all of that we will keep it to find a place where we will be fellowshiping because we spending a lot of money here and we need a place where we like we can call our home so that I have been said are you going to take all the time brother Branham is my example you say brother branham your example Paul say follow me as I follow Christ so brother branham follow Christ and I am following brother branham everybody clear so brother branham even though he spoke and he said that the path belonged to the pastor brother branham took a salary and if we reach a point where I need to take a salary I would do it but at this point no all the money goes for the building brother Steven you a pastor you working do you pay tithe brother branham is my example I have a code brother branham was a pastor and vada Branham was working and brother Branham was paying tasks so as a pastor working I will be paying Tata I have to abide with Tata except I stop my work that's when I don't have to pay it out but as long as I'm working my business need to pay tithe and I need to pay Todd and those money will go for the building everybody clear so far now as far as handling the money of the church I'm going to say this brother branham say in the message by faith Moses he says as he brother Egon and many and some of the trustees setting here we just talked about the usher now we want to talk about the money he say I see some of the trustees setting here after we had our trustee meeting the other night it is true I publicly before the church that each of each one of you all are no longer appointed trustees so trustees are also appointed everybody clear they are no longer appointed trustees you are elected trustees and your name on the book all right so at this point we are not electing trustees but we are appointing trustees who sanction those trustees it's going to be you the congregation voting whether you like those men or not but those men have high integrity they are honest men I believe that they are Christian I believe that brother John Potter is a Christian I believe that brother Abel brought a Robert and whoever is going to be handling the money our question at this point they are appointed but as we move on down the road we need to continue to pray until we find out that we are more comfortable the church is stabilized then at that point we will elect and once the elect they're not going to be appointed trustees but they're going to be elected trustees any question so far clear so those brother that I spoke to one of this day so when we transfer our account I took those brother and I'd put them into the account because I don't wanna handle money I wanna be focusing on the preaching of the word the reason why the office of the Deacon was open in the scripture if you go read it in the book of fact the Bible says that they opened the office of the deacon so that they apostle will spend their time in prayer and into the preaching of the word so I want to be spending my time in prayer in preaching of the word and in taking care of God sheep but as far as handling the money those brother have their own online username they know these in the account I'm gonna be there overseeing as a pastor but I'm now going to be there make the transaction when you put your money here the end of that they have the checkbook they have everything I'm completely out of it everybody clear so those brother are only appointed at this time but they need to be elected by the church and we need to give the church the time to pray until which if we need to add one more trustee we're going to Adam if we need to add it we're gonna add them if we need to add a sunday-school superintendent we're gonna have it but at this point is just uh sure to take care of us when you come here or to take care of the problem and we're gonna have trustees to take care of the transaction when I say trustee is appointed we nee we are looking for a building so when you hear something about a building it's not only those two brothers give them a call give me a call if you hear that there is a place there or a land where they are selling there we are all in this together so whatever you hear bring it to us we will work together and we will try to figure it out so those brother are going to be the one responsible at this plant brother Stephen is now using any task your Todd is going to go to the building we are a new church we don't have a credit we need to build more found in order to find our own building so we dedicated all those fund except the offering where we need to pay these bills and everything that is going on by the tight money is going to be solely dedicated to fund a building every church is sovereign that's my way that I felt led at this point if you want to add your money for a building fund that is up to you you can do it but at this point that's the direction we will be going everybody clear so far so for the brothers that I have just called their name here I was trying to call them here but I believe everybody knows brother Abel I believe everybody knows brother John Porter everybody knows brother Jim Kelly but I Robert if you don't mind for one minute let's just stand here so the church sees you we're not going to lay a hand on you we're not going to pray for you yet because we need to go through the process but at least everybody knows who is responsible who do they need to contact what to do and what to go from there brother David is not here he went into a funeral but he's the man one responsible for the computer the sound system and he got help already brother Marcus and the other brothers those are the brother that are fair led to move phone with them and we have brother John Porter we have brother Jim kebaya there we have brother Micah deli we have brother Abel and we have brother Roberts over there so these are the men that are going to be working as a team and there will be the one taking some of the part of the Lord and I'm gonna be focusing more into the word you see them and God bless you thank you God if you have any question you can call me we can talk because sometimes we don't have time to ask question like this but I'm open to question for those brothers that I have just brought here on a pulpit this is what I'm gonna say in front of the church Radha Branham say may every officer of the church fill his post of duty knowing this that God is going to hold you as possible for how you held your office in the church each one will have to give an account so this is my code to the brothers everybody will have to give an account for what they're doing it's not gonna be blame on me everybody will have to give an account on what they are doing so at this point continue to pray for us as we continue to find places and to work on this together and I don't want anybody to feel like they are laid out they are lay back or they feel like they are they're here just doing nothing this is family if you feel like you need to help rudder able or brother David to work or put up the equipment or something come on time here twenty thirty minute early you can do it if you feel like you need a same thing if you feel like you need a piano play and anybody in this church especially young people that feel like you can play an instrument I will strongly encourage you find a place where you can learn it tell us she's gonna cost and the church is gonna take care of it but under one condition if you choose to do it you must be serious with it if you not gonna be serious with it don't do it so if you want to do it go learn the piano go learn the keyboard go learn the organ go learn the guitar whatever you want to learn learn it and maybe by the grace of God within three mouths we should have all these equipment here and everybody playing music so if you have a voice use it not for sure but for glory of God if you feel like you can do it parent let us know let us know how much is gonna come and we're gonna look at the budget in the offering now they task the task is for the building and then we can see if we can afford it we put it together if we can we can use our own money put it there so that the church can be built any questions so far so that's what I hate God which we bless you you might be spending as we read the Word of God god bless you if you can get your Bible first King chapter 17 I hope some of you have been listening to the sermon of on Wednesday if you missed it because a lot of people were not here on Wednesday so if you didn't listen to the sermon you need to really really pay attention and I encourage you if you are not here on Wednesday make sure you listen to the sermon and the Holy Spirit's just brought this back to me right now brother Stephen you have been preaching alone do you believe in far for ministry absolutely a hundred percent for some time you must see me pastoring a lot of it but after a while once I feel the signal from the Holy Spirit we're going to open the door and begin to bring brother back and forth because we believe in far for industry so do you believe you wanna be having preachers here yes got some contact I will get more contact and we're going to open the door case somebody had a question so you're not going to have your pastor every day you will have a flavor of other ministry for the edifying the building up of the church everybody clear now first in chapter 17 verse 10 if you dare you can say Amen we are dealing with the two pools the last Sunday we dealt with the widow part and the Holy Spirit already gave me signal to deal with one particular subject I am so nobody's overwhelming or crowded so we started with the pools though first and a second pool and we're going to continue with them until God help us to clear that so you will see because brother Brahim in history it brought the terminology of pools so you might be wondering what is the pool what is the pool what is that in the Bible that's a reason why we want you to understand the ministry the reason why we're preaching this we don't want any more doubt about the message we want you to be grounded in the message and once we begin to soul we don't have to be questioning the message or going back and forth you know where this is coming from so verse 10 so he arose Elijah and went to zurafa and when he came to the city to the gate of the city everybody understand my voice clearly to the gate of the city behold the widow woman we already explained this was their gathering of sticks you might be seated and he called to her and say bring me I pray you a little water in a vessel if you notice here when Elijah approaches the widow woman Elijah asked the older woman to bring him order in a vessel so this water must be in a vessel when Eliezer met Rebecca Rebecca had a vessel he was a preacher and eliazar asked for water but the order must be in a vessel when Jesus met the woman at the well the woman had well had a vessel so when Jesus asked for water water must be in the vessel either the vessel might be apart the vessel might be a pitcher the vessel might be something but water must be in a vessel brother Branham said the reason why Jesus asked that give me a drink he said he was engaging into a conversation he was opening a door to the conversation so asking the water from the pitcher was a way to engage into a conversation everybody clear so far now that I'm a drink verse 11 and as she was going to bring it he called to her and say bring me I pray you a morsel of bread in your hand and she said as the Lord your God lives lives I have not a cake so this woman explained to Elijah that what she has is a cake and we saw the other time that that cake was milk makes you fall and they make a cake so there are two things that Elijah is interacting with this woman number one is the water in a vessel and the first thing Elijah asked for bread and the woman had a cake and very clear a cake but a handful of meal in a barrel and a leader all in a cruise and behold I am gathering two sticks and we know the two sticks were to make fire so we found that there is a water vessel here there is a cake and they will also fire that is made out of wood everybody clear those three element the to stick that I may go and dress it for me and my son and we may eat it and die verse 13 Elijah enter into the terminology of the woman he say and Elijah said to her fear not go and do as you have said I'd make me there of a leader cake everybody clear first and bring it to me and after make for you and photo son we have a water in the vessel we have a cake and we have fire in the wood that's how Elijah interrupted with this little woman let's go to chapter 19 of first king if you dare you can say Amen chapter 19 verse 5 everybody there the Bible says that and as he lay and slept this is Elijah under a juniper tree behold then an angel touched him who is that angel right here we don't know yet an angel touched him and said to him arise and eat verse 6 and he looked and behold the walls al everybody clear everybody here can you look at your board the angel spoke about Earth okay behold there is a cake baked under did you see fire here everybody clear okay there is a cave was a cake baked on the coast who created the cake the angel who created the cause the angel everybody thank you and a cruse of what water water email so when the angel is interacting with Elijah he also brought those three elements together everybody clear water at his head and he did eat and drink and lead done four seven angel of the Lord so the one who was doing this was the angel of the Lord and we know that the angel of the Lord is of the Covenant so we found out that these three elements are the element of the angel of the Lord so whatever was going on between Elijah and this woman the angel of the Lord equip Elijah with those things because the Ministry of Elijah when he's approaching he must approach with the water a vessel not just water in a vessel Elijah when he's approaching there must be a cake what is a cake Elijah when is approaching there must be fire on the wood and those three element of the angel who was found not on the Jews women on ingenta Widow a very clear and the angel of the Lord came again the second time so we found out that Elijah have a first touch our there and then I can touch from the angel of the Lord and the third touch was in Mount Horeb either no problem and the angel of the Lord came again the second time and touch him and say arise and eat because the journey is too great for you and he rose and did eat and drink and went in the strength of the meat forty days and forty nights to Horeb the Mount of God over there he received an experience which was his third touch through touches from the angel of the Lord and the third one is an experience in Mount Horeb which we saw all sunset mantle so let's go to Colossians chapter 3 and we're going to be praying if you dare you can say Amanda Colossians chapter 3 verse 14 pages are still turning coalition is after Philippian and Tessa Union everybody there verse 14 and above all things put on charity we know charity means love which is the capstone are their charity love which is the bond of perfectness so if you want perfection if you want to bond things correctly if you want to bond things in a proper way if you want to bind things correctly in the church you need the capstone you need love are there with the capstone you can put everything that was in disorder in order everything that was loose and throughout the edges can be put back together in perfection with the capstone ministry everybody clear let's pray then Heavenly Father Lord we thank you again for your grace you love your mercy for giving us another opportunity to be gathered together around your world Lord we are committing this service again unto the handle may the Holy Spirit may the asad teacher may you come Lord and teach your word and stabilize this church and pastor it Lord for the glory of your name father we we buek every demonic spirit away from us may all our mind be completely sent focused around the word of command god bless you brother Marcus and brother Abel for working together to help our brother David is out god bless you now we are dealing with this part here the unchanging pattern of God part 14 now we and we began in this particular session we found that Elijah was first fed close by bread and we found old bread means divine healing and by divine healing in Malachi for the Ministry of Elijah was prophesized that there will be a Sun of righteousness that is coming up and that Sun of righteousness will bring healing into his wings so on Wednesday as a quicker recall when we talked about healing how will that will how will the healing or the gift of healing under the Ministry of Elijah be expressed into the gentle and we found out on Wednesday quickly that we there was a man by the name of Moses and Moses was given three sons Moses had a son of miracle where he threw the road and the road was turned into a snake and he pulled the road back and it was back again into a road and we also found out that Moses had the second son in hand where he put the Sun in honor on his heart and when he pulled the son out we found that sin came out leprosy came out and what Branham say leprosy was a tap of sin in other words the second son of Moses was the son that revealed the sin of the heart when the hand went on it was a clean hand when he entered into the people sin he reveal sin he exposed sin and when sin is atoned or dealt with when they put the hand back again the hand came back normal showing that the heart was already clean and the third sign holds that God told him that if they don't follow the first son the voice of the first son the voice of the second son then you want to go be like the third son which is you're gonna take the water from the now and you want to pour that on the ground and that water will be turned into blood and we found out that there is two ways you can pour water you can use a vessel to carry water and you pour that on the ground or you can use the power of the spoken word where you can just speak to this mountain and the mountain will be displaced without an effort so we found out that those three son Moses or the Bible refer to them as sons but we express to you that when God works in or when God is moving on in his kingdom the characteristic of God remained the same their form might change the name might change but the characteristic still the same if you look at John the Baptist you're going to call him John the Baptist but even when Jesus came when Jesus Christ came he look at John the Baptist he called him Elijah so what you call John the Baptist according to the scripture is Elijah if you go back in the Bible you will never find the word John the Baptist in the Old Testament if you go back in the Bible you won't find the word Jesus Christ in the Old Testament yet Jesus was in the Old Testament but his name was just hidden but when he came in he had to work with sons and by the son he was a way to attract the people to make them believe who the messenger is in order to point them into a certain direction so what was called son in the Ministry of Moses we found out that in our ministry he got a different terminology brother Branham said that if they didn't believe the son then the third son really gathered all ministries has three sons well is whatever I'm getting that in the Bible Moses had three sons are you there the brother Branham gives you the scripture no was he lying no idea all right if it is sent from God Jesus had three sons Moses had prisons no ahead prisons Elijah had three son everything comes in three sons so if we expect brother branham to be the elijah of this end time we must have also three sons everybody clear but those son are not called sons they are called in a ministry something different brother branham say word that the son do what is the purpose of asana why everybody here he said the Sun is to attract the attention the Sun is to pull somebody else so we can call it an attraction we can call it a Sun we can call it a pool because the concern of Moses was I am growing there by the people will not believe me so God helped to equip Moses with croissant and by the treason is gonna attract the elect is going to remove the elect from the destruction of the world from the destruction of the denomination from the destruction of the pentecostal to attract the left like what is really going on over there are we there it is to attract the attention and get the elect ready so the Sun is to attract you and to prepare you that you're approaching the woman have to go through these three things to prepare the woman because something was coming and very clear praise the Lord and get there electri D and out of the way before judgment struck that's what Noah did got the elect ready the rest of them and what does he do the Sun and the voice of the Sun condemns the unbeliever and get him ready for judgment he gets the elective ready for the escape because we have three Exodus the first Exodus was Moses the second Exodus was Jesus Christ but the third Exodus is the rapture one was taking Israel from one nation the other one who formed denominational out but this Exodus is what son is that's what son are given for for the coming judgement to the elect deceit let the leader woman with a pure heart a default body and the Pharisee with pure body and a devourer heart it takes the second ministry or the second son to dig into the heart of the Pharisee and to bring back the scene that was under there but if you remember the angel that spoke to Eleazar was the same angel that spoke to Rebecca you know the pillar of fire that follow Moses follow Israel the pillow fire the follow brother branham is also with the blood the woman at the well even though she was a prostitute but she had a representation in glory in other word hell and Jesus Christ was of the same species are you deaf praise God he say a pure heart and a defier body he condemned one and save the other and the very judgment has saved Moses condemned the world he is preaching he gets the elect ready what is the elect level when they see a god-sent son they look back endure that's why the Bible said brother Branham say the Bible say brother Branham say whatever happened in the ministry of brother Branham if you want to challenges to me and I'm going to say it I didn't brother Branham so many people had the picture of Jesus Christ he said Othman had a picture he said Saul's men have the picture brother Branham said they did it by the inspiration that they had but who could say this one is right and this one is wrong are you there when brother branham had a vision of Jesus Christ when brother Branham Luke Edge's trust brother Branham said that between everybody that had the picture of Jesus Christ the one that matches what also is the future of Earth man are you there when brother Branham said that nobody saw it you didn't see didn't see it he was brother Branham himself who saw it but the problem is in 1963 when the cloud came the cloud unveiled the picture of man over there the cloud confirmed that brother Branham was right the cloud was not drawn by brother Branham the cloud was not joined by element he was right there in the sky and the picture of the cloud much as the picture of Earth man so if you want to destroy the picture of the cloud you cannot all the picture of Earthmen [Applause] it's a confusion it's a spirit of confusion either earth man confirm the cloud if you keep earth man in your church you must keep the cloud because the cloud confirm it's a spirit of confusion you are creeping off man and you are rejecting the cloud and the cloud when decay to the Prophet and off man [Music] hallelujah we say the Olay get the elect ready what is they literally fall when they see God's and Sun they look back in the scripture and see if that is supposed to be dead why everything must be proven by the scripture are you there so what was cause son in the ministry of moses it is called pool in the ministry of brother Branham but the pools in the Bible are sons to do what to attract their elect and just like Moses had proposed brother Branham also had word triple and the first pool brother Branham called that healing we saw it on Wednesday the second pool brother Branham called prophecy and sometime brother Branham called that discernment we gave you those two code so the second pool brother Branham code that prophecy and brother Branham called that discernment we did whatever Adam called that there are you there but we know under the second pool is the Sun where the hand is put and he reveal the scene of the heart because sometimes they were praying for people and they don't get here so God have to dig in their life and to find out what is the sin that he have done in their life and once this scene is clear then the man is a pill are you there but brother Branham called that prophecy does prophecy discern the heart brother Branham called discernment does discernment desert the heart said Tech first Corinthians chapter 14 I'm going to go slowly just be patient with me I can now rush with these things we don't want any question around this ministry so if I take part 14 part 15 understand me either I can load you in five hours and you are lost or we can go slowly as a pastor and go clearly everybody there like brother Abel says he want to take it a little bit of the time you didn't know God was talking 1st Corinthians chapter 14 you don't know how many times God is talking to me through people in this church they calling me they ask me question they don't know the question mean something I might be talking to a brother he said something he didn't know another brother told me the exact same thing my wife can tell you that over and over all over it's happening somebody just asked a question do we need to do this and that's and it's exactly in line I was talking to a sister yesterday with my wife and while we were talking I said sister if I show you my computer run out what we talk right now is the sermon for tomorrow everybody there first Corinthians chapter 14 verse 24 but if all prophesy everybody clear did you see that I want you to make sure you seen it if our prophesy it's prophecy and they come in one that believe not or one unlearned he is convinced of all he is judged of all verse 25 and that's our the secret of his so that's why because the second pool was unveiling the secret of the heart brother Branham called up who prophesy everybody clear did brother Branham ever give you a scripture when you see brother Branham saying something just believe it and the saddle it are you there let's go to the book of Ephesians chapter 5 chapter 6 if you dare you can say Amen I don't have too many scriptures Ephesians chapter 6 verse 17 everybody there and like the helmet of salvation and the sword of the so the spirit have a sword everybody in that and the sword of the Spirit which is there so the Word of God is the source we fill the secret of the heart now we undetermined either the sword of the Spirit is the Word of God let's go to Hebrews chapter 4 somebody has already seen that Hebrew chapter 4 verse 2 verse 12 you should be coding that already everybody there for the word of God which is the sword of the Spirit very clear the Word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged everybody clear piercing even to the dividing asunder of the soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and a discerner everybody clear off dead and intent after that's why brother Branham called the second pull prophecy and he called that discernment because discernment and prophecy revealed the secret of let's go to Luke chapter 2 for an appetizer everybody there Luke chapter 2 verse 35 then we continue Luke chapter 2 verse 35 everybody there talking to Mary shall pierce through your own we know that the heart is the occupation of the soul remember that important living word and the sword shall pierce through your own soul also that did thoughts it was a prophecy upon Mary for the Ministry of Jesus Christ and the thoughts of many hearts may be it may be Revere what is revealing a sword going into the are you there I'm going to get ahead of myself let's go to the book of Judges because I felt led by the Holy Spirit to go Dada I kept it later but let's deal with Scripture and then we move on straight everybody there the book of judge judges verse seven now you understand when brother Branham said prophesy discernment is the second poll from today you understand that put the book of Judges chapter 9 chapter 7 everybody there Gideon was going to face an army of Nabila and Gideon was afraid and I want you to go there and you're going to hear something in the camp of the enemy that's going to be comforting or strengthening you because in the camp of the enemy one person was there they had a gift of vision you said the enemy has a gift of vision yes gift and calling out without repentance are you there Judah had a gift Caiaphas prophesy brother branham's he was of the devil are you there and not only was somebody with the gift of prophecy over there also with the gift of interpretation of dreams 7 verse 9 everybody there and he came to pass the same not that the Lord said to him it was get you down to the hosts for I have delivered it into your hand but if you feel go down if you feel to go you go with pora your servant down to host and you shall hear what they say and afterward you shall after all shall your hands be strengthened to go down to the host so god instead of giving this vision to the prophet of Israel God gave the vision to the enemy from the mouth of your enemy they will be confessing what God is doing in your life either God gave the vision to Pharaoh God gave the vision to nabuchadnezzar God gave the prophecy to Caiaphas and one of this day every knee shall bow every tongue should confess whether they like Jesus or not that Jesus is God are you there so God said go there everybody following me now let me drop down to 13 and when Gideon was come he went to the hosts the all the world's he meant that Todd a dream to his fellow and brother branham say a dream when he happened or one it is interpreted it's a vision are you there that's why I say vision I'm saying that because I'm looking with the seals the seals are breaking that up you know you need you need the seals for this book he said there was a man that taught him to his fellow and say behold a dream a dream and no L a what a cake of barley remember Elijah met the woman she had what a cake the angel of the Lord when he produce food for Elijah he brought what we are talking about the sword of the Spirit but clear okay there is there was a cake of barley bread tumble into the host of median and came to attend and snorted that he fell and overturn it that détente lay along what was destroying the camp of Midian he was a cake what does that cake mean are you then verse 14 the other fella is giving the interpretation and his fellow answered and saying this is nothing else after either serve the sword so a cake represented a soul and the soul is the designer of the intent of the so when Elijah mated with the woman she must have her cake when the angel of the Lord bring the equipment he must be a Ministry of the sword to discern everybody clear and his fellow said this is nothing else says the sword of Gideon the son of Jewish a man of Israel for into his hand has got the liver media and all host so the interpretation was the sword of who did job to verse 18 when I blow with a trumpet I am all data with me then blow you the trumpet so every sad all of all DCAM and say the sword of who I thought he was the sword of Gideon they sought after and of who the sword of God and His Messenger that's why under the third pool when brother Branham was praying the sword of the king struck his head and brother branham said his hand not the sword of water problem but it's the sword of the Lord and brother branham his feet his head are you there the angel of the Lord took his and put on somebody's shirt and went abroad and random took his own and put it there any matches the sword of the Lord and Gideon are there why we need the second pool first there is water that's why brother brother have to engage into a discussion how do you do sister how are you doing he's bringing he's asking for order he's asking for order and suddenly he said you know there is somebody between me and you the angel of the Lord is there pulling the sword and before you know it what about himself I see you twenty years I see you walking over there it is the sword that is dividing it is in a scripture in the Ministry of Raja and he only happened to the widow woman of the Delta the first full healing second poor prophecy or discernment word and we found out that they turn pool with healing we have healing by miracle we explained that on Wednesday and we also have healing by casting out of Devils are you there now brother branham say take this thick turn it into a snake we already seen Bassam they won't listen to that then your hand in your bosom that's a second son pull it out here yourself of leprosy then they shall believe it and then if they were here then waters out of the now down there pour it on the dry land and all of the waters who become glad there was a National Sun that's why the cloud has to be taken by somebody else because the cloud must be a national Sun the people who believe it when them that's ready to receive it David when they see the Son of God moving but the nation has to have something different that life he have to be on the newspaper because it is a National Sun and we found out that those two sons were under the atonement we say we explained that always did what about the third son is the third son under the atonement well that oh I just can't say nothing about it for I can't place it in the atonement that's all brother branham whosoever say it shall come to pass you can have what you say what about him say I don't see that in the atonement because Jesus give that amendment before he died are you there and I have stood here at the same pulpit and try and run on the scripture and we frame through it and go back because I was afraid to use it dan brother branham begin to think about that scripture he say and he got after I was speaking there for a while inside myself just thinking till I became so conscious of something near til he was talking to said I was talking to someone and something said to me that is in the atonement the torture for if a man or a woman it is so consecrated and surrendered to God and that God just moving and uses their voice and it is not men speaking it is God that is in him speaking so the third son is also under the atonement and the son of speaking to it if you go to the book of Matthew you'll find that when Jesus entered the earth a Roman centurion that came to him he was not a Jew and as I say I will go and heal your servant and the men say no no no no no we Gentile we don't operate like that the laying of a lease for the Jewish people we gentle I am a military man when I say go the men go when I say come the men come I'm gonna tell you I want you to use the power of the spoken word and one Jesus Luke Israel I have not found this face these Pharisees for the Delta either he was in the pool is also in the atonement and what the panel said everything that is in the atonement is a personal property of every leader [Music] healing is the children's bread we realize that it's in the atonement and the atonement first is applied to us oh I am the God I forgive you your sins and heal you your disease soul and healing sin right and healing has always fallen every lesson the Sun of righteousness arise with healing meaning there is a message are there and it's also been a meant to get the people together that's why brother Branham called that a pool are you deaf okay let me drop down divine healing and singing and festival I've brought a ball for it used to say it's their bed on the hook and you should officially bid not the hook because there is a rainbow trout that God is looking but in order to gain the attention God hook the first pool when you begin to heal people then suddenly you turn around you say there's a preacher day they have a strong gift of healing when you approach him he opened the second pool and when you enter you say your name is Colima yo did you know me before Abraham before before your friend caught you when you are playing under the fig tree I'll show you there oh you are the Messiah that was a that was it are you there and he says that that is just the thing to get the people to listen a while till you can really free your so to focus your attention get your Facebook get you off this get you off this until you have really focused then he fire one Tom are you there and he gets you wantem and your salvation is secure eternally are you know he said God has did that in every age through every age there has always been a healing campaign and if it's a genuine healing campaign behind our campaign always is a message there never is a son given just for son it is for running a message are you there everybody clear so far but random continually said divine healing is just like going fishing ever sure they fish the hook if you notice the bait is a food I read they cat is a food okay I hope you get that one I hope you get that one are you okay when Jesus met the be subtle after his conversation with the woman at the well the disciple brought food from the city they said master you must eat you say no I want it they say wait a minute who gave you food Jesus say I have meat I have food that you don't understand my food is not your natural it is to do the will of the Father the Bible is written in symbols you need their prophet to unlock the symbols are you there and he grabbed the bear you just show him the babe he grabs the bait and get the hook that's the way it is with divine healing it's attractive poo because it demonstrates and prove that there is a God that lives and is interested in you you know there is a healing coming up there is a man who's interested in you he begin to give you gift he's trying to pull your attention are you there okay and the believer the unbelievers see that quickly his eye catches it and knows there is a living God and then he's on the land of what salvation now he begin to follow after God can go to controlling him dead and winding him in so that's what divine healing is for merely for the sake everybody clear so on Matthew 7 we found out that both the first and the second pool was impersonated because Jesus say many shall come in my name this I said have we not cast on never have will not prophesy this and this so in other word the first and the second pool be impersonated that's what Jesus was saying because casting out Devils doing miracle it's the first full prophecy is the second pool and Jesus say many will come to me say have we not prophesy in your name second pool have we not cast our devil in your name first pool have we not one miracle in your name first pool I said and I will answer them I don't know you in other words the first and the second pool will be impersonated everybody here now what we what we call son in the Bible through Moses in our prophet ministry it is called pools are you there for there Brad that is called the gifts to the spirit relax are you there check first Corinthians chapter 12 probably there might be one or two or one more scripture and we know we're gonna read anymore unless the Lord directed are you there 1st Corinthians chapter 12 you gonna read the Bible and you follow the board everybody clear please verse 7 the Bible says four to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom there is a gift called the word of wisdom it is called God gift we going through the non gift that gift is under the office of prophecy watch your color blue blue are you there I'm going slowly verse 7 verse 7 let me go by verse 7 I jump into it but the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit with us so every man have access to this are you there some are born but even if you're not born for for the gift you have the right to the gift are you there I have a code for that one is given the gift of the word of wisdom the add-in added the word of what knowledge I put the word of knowledge under prophesy brother Branham helped me up but you are just trying to learn how to write the check for your healing well now if he might do something that would speak to you of something that has been that he had to have a have be the spirit of prophecy or a gift of the word off everybody clear that would go back down through your life journey and find something down through there and bring it back to your memory so a gift of knowledge the world of knowledge works like prophecy everybody here he could take the profit with the gift of what everybody here and first show them what was going to be and there could speak it because it's a word of knowledge that God gives to his prophet and he'd foretell it before he come to pass because God knows all things so that's why the word of knowledge is under prophecy everybody clear let's continue now first heed for one the spirit of the word of wisdom another the word of knowledge by the same spirit to another faith faith to do what miracle if I have all the faith to move the mountain if I have not charity first to do what miracle faith fall under the first pool I'm going slowly okay let's go now verse 9 first by the same spirit to another the gift of word healing under the first pool we clear by the same spirit it's the same spirit to another they're working off mirakl under the first pool everybody there no problem let's go and to another prophecy under the second pool everybody clear to another discernment of spirit under the second pool to another deference kind of tongue to another interpretation of tongue when you speak in tongue and the reason interpret it is prophecy are you there both of those days everybody there so right here you can see that all you're not gift are under the first and the second pool are we there that's why the devil can impersonate all of those gift because the first and the second who can be impersonated let's go there Delta who make us impersonate every gift why did brother Branham say that could make us go out lay hand on the secret Facebook and then would recover could make us speak in tongue second pool could make us interpret tongue second pool could make us have wisdom second pool knowledge second pool but that doesn't take it Lord you say look how brother branham is hooking that with matthew seven you say many will come in there do you see how brother branham is taking the gift of the Spirit and this scripture and putting them together I didn't fabricate that either many will come in that day and say Lord Lord have we not done these things in your name he said depart for me working often so brother branham take this first pool and the second pool that Jesus was put and combined them with the gift of the Spirit and left it alone you need the Spirit that work with brother Branham to understand the message of brother Branham are you there why are people toast about take all your gift that you have in the scripture the devil can impersonate every one of them but he can impersonate love you remember love is the bond of what perfection love is the capstone he can play around with those gifts is that but not love are we clear now okay because love is genuine the devil can love are you then that's one thing he can do and when you get to a place that you love one another and all the world is dead I'm going slowly I will imply in you of Pentecostal idea into the message of the hour are you there love is what they turn pool cannot be passionate all that I'm going slowly now what about you efficient for all your form Ministry of Ephesian are under the second pool that's what Branham a seer a vision seer or a prophet whatever you want to call it a prophet is a compound word okay just like sanctification is a compound word means clean and set aside service and there is many word and especially in our English words are compound but the Prophet means to give personal experience under inspiration or foresee things another code word random say and I stood still if people call me prophet many time because they prophet in English Testament is just a apostle preacher evangelist preacher teacher preacher pastor preacher and all all the faithful ministry preacher therefore under see second pool a little professor foretelling of the world identification of crust the English word profit PR o th et means earth preacher just anybody preaching under the under prophecy so if this gift whatever is under the first book and the second book can be impersonated the faithful ministry also can be impersonated let's go to 2nd Corinthians chapter 11 don't be after preacher don't be after gift go first to love and then after love you go back now to creatures are you there verse 11 everybody there that happy 11 verse 13 for such are false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into a postal off and no Marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light verse 15 therefore it is not great things if his ministers also be transformed as ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to the work that's why preacher need to be very careful preaching the message does not qualify you you might be preaching the message but your heart is like a devil get into the world of preacher and you have a stumbling block the people that stand on a poopy talking they can tell you one thing today tomorrow they say something different they like here the under pornography they under this and this they forget that the file for ministry can be personated are you there what do we need to do brother Steven I will rather have a church that knows nothing about any spiritual gift so brother Steven we don't need non spiritual gift hold on let me look this and kill the church and I just and just be so in love with each other and with Christ I rather have that than every spiritual gift operating in the church whatever Adam doesn't say we don't need spiritual gift he's bringing a point and I'm gonna let him say I don't want to explain it then you will say that's brother Steven explanation no let him himself explain are you there now that might sound hard in a Pentecostal group but I would I would rather have it where there is gift there shall fail right that's why per se when that which is perfect to come it even come in the day of power you need to come in the end time are you deaf okay now where there is gift there shall bring confusion where there is gift they can be questioned but where there is love it is perfect and God is love that's what the Bible say are you there that's right if you have perfect love you would have perfect gift in other words be united first with your husband be united first will crush your first husband must die once you are united with your correct husband then automatically your gift bus because love is the bonds of perfection that's the capstone to correct the gift to put their gift in life to put the minister in life to put your life in line are you there and if you had perfect love you had perfect deep that's why so work first with love that brings fellowship is love between you and God it brings fellowship and fellowship brings what when you consecrate your life landing your own business not being on the telephone about people consecrating yourself before you know it you'll find a vision pop up you'll find yourself speaking in tongue at work you'll find yourself the angel visiting you the problem is we only follow all the trauma no love no fellowship no consecration and the gift is locked because if God opened up with the life you are living now it's going to be a mess it's going to encourage you to do bad things I lied and I pray for the sick and he got healed it's not going to help you to repent that's a problem with preachers they say one thing today tomorrow they change they do something bad they don't repent and they go pray and the anointing fall and they think like what they did is right but what you see Pentecostal people you are going after this in his field of death Giver come back to God get the real divine love in your heart your fellowship that you just love him with all your heart brother the gift you will take care of itself we made the gift but be careful it's a dangerous ground so to have your gift in order you need perfect bond and perfect bond comes from the love of God which is the message of the hour that's why I would not by God's grace deviate from the message I won't give you alfalfa here and you go crazy are you there you just love him with your heart brother give to a take care of itself just let that alone another one consequent mark to your husband the more you love your husband your husband gets so crazy until when he is coming from work he stopped we say let me stop a bell let me get some chocolate let me get something like this and before you know it you open the door hear this oh why did you answer me because love is flowing and heaps take care of themselves since your husband being your husband be close to him and before you know it you will have to serve that check when he gets so drunk not with whiskey Belov he's gonna tell you that the credit card incorporated gives our medical they won't get mad at you because you work out with the groceries that's a pastoral message this is a man God will bless in the church the press that he sees you after he is adopted you in the family he will call you someday in a later prayer meeting the first thing you know and place their robe upon you and say now son I have sent you to preach the gospel the whole world will know about it that's right he will call you out and say son I have send you to pray for the sick in other words the more you consecrated one day God will come directly and speak to you and say brother LeMond the reason why I put you in my kingdom I want you to do this clear you don't have to push anything but random continually say the people that believe in him knows him unless they are constantly in the word to know what you is if you are not constantly in the world how are you gonna know what your husband is telling you are you there now now he shall appear in the last day is to bring the people back to the world so that Brad so that the bride would know her husband know her met the reserved world your husband is the reveal get in the message and the gift will operate automatically every age he was the same cry he what he says the speech say if you are Christian you will get back to what the Spirit is teaching that is the word of this age every messenger to every edge will preach that word every fresh and true revival will be because men have gotten back to the world of death that's why I must keep the message fewer because if the message is not pure brother branham said the revolver dies but if we keep the message pure you want to see automatically in your life one after the other gives to begin to pop up in this church are you there are you there from the first book I got you brother Maurice the Bible Genesis to the last book revelation there is only one reason for God displeasure live in the world and there is only one remedy to began his favor back to the world you are the favor of God back to the message but woe unto that congregation when an anointed man of God tries to bring them to the word and they won't line up with it how is he going to have a church that all denali-- gift is operating in and so forth day and that and the church won't even live decently and morally won't learn their ABCs of the gospel then say if I had a better preacher it's not the preacher why it's your fault we want the clean life consecrated with the word and automatically the gifting so confused by the evidence of the Holy Ghost and so forth Saturn can impersonate any kind of gift that God has God but he cannot bring them word word by word that's where he fell in the Garden of Eden that is where he always fell your husband is the revealed word so the woman of the world had water the word a widowed woman water and cake and there was two times that the angel of the Lord touch Elijah by bringing him cake in water which we already explained --'tis and those two touch are the first and the second two are you there and the third one he goes from Horeb why there is a rainbow trout which have a rainbow a covenant it shad any left of God then God need to hook you but to hook he used the bait to use their bed and then he opened up with the second pool to prepare your heart husband comes and uh but the husband is Bob Oh God richly bless you you might say you may be standing as a summary brother Steve and what are you talking about we're talking about the pools the sons in the ministry of the entire God the angel of the Lord work with brother branham with three sons and brother branham say if I die that angels stay with the brand but when the Angels stay with the Brad do we still have the first and the second and the third cool yes we have them not do we going to be holding people like brother branham no but the gift of the Spirit have been placed displayed to you for God to continue to use you to heal you but before you get there make sure you pay attention to your husband get connected to your husband and the gift would take care of itself get in love with God pray pray consecrate yourself before you know it you sleep and God give you a dream before you know it you are home and something tell you go up in your daughter's bedroom you open your door that you say what are you doing mama how did you know because you in contact with somebody who can watch over your kids who can watch over your kids what are they in school your kids might be out somewhere and something tell you call him you pick up the phone you say where are you at you say mama I'm coming home you didn't know that call stop him from doing something are you there why because you in contact you in contact with him fellowship with him first search first the kingdom of God give him first the preeminence then everything else will be taken care of it automatically you don't have to push you don't have to pull you don't have to touch I want to be a deacon automatically by the banham say he will appoint you to his place he will say this one need to be here this one need to be here this one needs to be here you don't have to fight you fought a lot you work a lot you put too much energy to fix your marriage to fix your life to fix your team to fix your job you work too much this is the time to relax when Ruth brought his case to go as Naomi say relax it is the responsibility of men to take care of you take your burden unto the Lord and leave it there put that son say father you gave it to me what am I gonna do that woman stood and say I am the widow woman this boy our Tita taught him right I didn't tell him to go do crazy things that weren't happening I don't know so on the scripture and the with the woman where is Raja God turn around and say what is for Adam and the angel said he's over there in airplane trouble the weather brought Dyer plane over the land the airplane and the manager come he said I believe the only hotel available is the one over there why was every hotel closed except the one close to the Naboo why was ever even close in a day Jesus was born because the lab have to be born in the stable so God
