[58:24] part two
[58:25] Genesis 39 verse
[58:29] 23 so this is like the Capstone of
[58:33] everything we have been talking about
[58:36] the cring this is dy the Capstone so
[58:40] follow me
[58:42] carefully because somebody must be
[58:45] delivered okay your life is going to
[58:49] change okay follow me very
[58:53] carefully Genesis 39: 23 if you dare you
[58:58] can say amen
[59:01] amen The Keeper of the
[59:04] prison look not to anything that was
[59:07] under his hand the hand of
[59:11] Joseph amen amen because the Lord was
[59:15] with
[59:17] him and that which he did the Lord made
[59:21] it
[59:22] [Applause]
[59:23] what this is not a
[59:26] Prosperity at your
[59:30] home you might be seated this is not a
[59:33] prosperity in a good
[59:37] Palace Joseph Prosper in the prison
[59:42] in they took somebody they put him in a
[59:45] dungeon in a prison do you follow me
[59:49] this is the capping my
[59:51] friend okay and in that condition there
[59:55] in the prison that's where he Prosper
[59:59] he's not prospering in the land he's not
[1:00:02] prospering maybe in a big beautiful
[1:00:04] palace he's prospering in prison so
[1:00:08] there is a potential a possibility when
[1:00:11] you are in prison to prosper inside that
[1:00:14] prison am follow me carefully my
[1:00:21] friend
[1:00:23] Joseph amen Joseph
[1:00:28] prospered
[1:00:33] where I wish all of you were here
[1:00:36] because I have to learn this thing let's
[1:00:38] go to chapter 40 verse one if you
[1:00:41] thereare you can say amen amen I'm going
[1:00:43] to go slow because this thing has to
[1:00:46] drop okay amen chapter 40 verse one and
[1:00:51] it came to
[1:00:52] pass after this these things that the
[1:00:58] battler of the king of Egypt do you know
[1:01:01] what a battler
[1:01:03] is everybody
[1:01:07] knows if you don't know raise your
[1:01:11] hand thank
[1:01:13] you a king usually have a big cup that
[1:01:18] he drink his wine and there is a person
[1:01:21] that is responsible for that he goes and
[1:01:24] take the grape and presses the grape and
[1:01:27] everything and put it in a cup and bring
[1:01:29] it to the king that person is called the
[1:01:34] battler sometime they would tell him to
[1:01:37] drink it first first yes sir so that if
[1:01:40] something if there is poison there he
[1:01:42] dies first and the King doesn't die so
[1:01:46] it's a great job with a big
[1:01:48] responsibility because whatever the
[1:01:50] battler is bringing is going to the king
[1:01:52] bellies we okay now
[1:01:54] the Bible says and he come to pass
[1:01:57] everybody can hear me
[1:01:58] okay he come to pass
[1:02:01] Hallelujah after these things that the
[1:02:03] battler of the king of Egypt and his
[1:02:07] Baker had offended their lord the king
[1:02:11] of Egypt so they did something bad I'm
[1:02:15] going to focus on the
[1:02:17] battler okay the
[1:02:21] battler the battler
[1:02:27] the
[1:02:32] butler
[1:02:34] offended the
[1:02:37] king in other word the butler was
[1:02:44] guilty amen but Joseph was not
[1:02:49] guilty that's true are we together so
[1:02:52] this battler had the POS
[1:02:56] position we don't know his name he has a
[1:02:59] position and from his position he messed
[1:03:05] up and what happened when he messed up
[1:03:10] amen verse uh two and Pharaoh was angry
[1:03:15] against the two of his
[1:03:17] officers against the chief of the
[1:03:20] Battlers everybody okay the chief the
[1:03:23] top one and against the chief of the
[1:03:26] Bakers I'm not going to touch the
[1:03:29] baker amen because the baker will be
[1:03:32] killed you know the story I'm staying
[1:03:34] with the battler
[1:03:36] okay verse three and he put them in word
[1:03:40] in other word in confinement in plain
[1:03:43] word in
[1:03:44] prison in the house of the captain of
[1:03:48] the Guard into the prison follow me
[1:03:52] carefully the place where who Joseph was
[1:03:59] bound so we got a prisoner right here
[1:04:03] and in this prison Joseph arve
[1:04:08] first are you following me when he
[1:04:11] arrived first Joseph
[1:04:14] lived in this
[1:04:18] prison and not only did Joseph live in
[1:04:21] the prison Joseph prospered
[1:04:26] in the prison condition do you follow
[1:04:30] me and Joseph begin to take care of the
[1:04:35] affair of the prison yes you know the
[1:04:38] story amen and the battler when he
[1:04:42] offend the king they don't send him to
[1:04:45] any kind of
[1:04:47] prison they took him and put him on the
[1:04:51] in the prison that Joseph was there why
[1:04:57] bre why was he only directed to a
[1:05:00] specific prison and they made sure that
[1:05:03] prison Joseph is there so Joseph and the
[1:05:06] batt who have more experience on the
[1:05:11] prison praise be to the name of the Lord
[1:05:15] verse four and the captain of the Guard
[1:05:18] charge Joseph with them they give Joseph
[1:05:21] their
[1:05:22] responsibility and and he served them

[1:05:34] didn't get to prison today and come out
[1:05:37] tomorrow so there was a season that he
[1:05:40] was locked up in the prison locked

[1:47:46] and they lied to him and they sold him
[1:47:48] for almost 30 pieces of silver and they
[1:47:51] saw Jesus Christ for almost what 30
[1:47:54] pieces of silver and when they took
[1:47:56] Joseph they remov his remant and they
[1:47:59] put Joseph into a dungeon and they took
[1:48:02] his Remnant and they send it back to his
[1:48:04] father because when Jesus Christ was
[1:48:06] dying going to hell he have to send his
[1:48:09] Spirit back to
[1:48:12] God are we together are we together are
[1:48:15] we together are we together and when
[1:48:18] they took him falsely accus they put him
[1:48:20] in the prison he found the battler and
[1:48:23] the baker one was hang and one was Sav
[1:48:26] at the cross Jesus Christ one was hang

[1:48:46] [Applause]
[1:48:48] Christ are we together are we together
[1:48:51] are we clear together are we clear
[1:48:54] together and notice now that before the
[1:48:58] battler get into the
[1:49:00] prison Joseph went
[1:49:03] first it in the prison and he went into
[1:49:07] the prison accused
[1:49:12] falsely everybody okay everybody okay
[1:49:15] before your trouble happened Jesus
[1:49:19] Christ already went
[1:49:22] [Applause]
[1:49:27] there is a difference of being in prison
[1:49:31] guilty or being in prison non
[1:49:35] guilty everybody okay if you did
[1:49:38] something wrong and they put you in
[1:49:41] prison you know what you did and you
[1:49:43] know what you deserve but if you didn't
[1:49:46] do anything wrong and they put you in
[1:49:49] prison then it is
[1:49:52] [Applause]
[1:49:54] painful in other word chist pain is
[1:49:58] greater than your
[1:50:00] pain Christ suffer more than you that's
[1:50:04] why water and blood
[1:50:07] separated brother Bram say he died of
[1:50:10] grief he was not the spe but he was the
[1:50:14] grief it was the
[1:50:16] regret that his own people sold him for
[1:50:20] something he never done they even
[1:50:22] manufactur li to condemn him he went to
[1:50:27] prison non guilty we were guilty but the
[1:50:31] good thing he went before you were
[1:50:37] born there is nobody in this church or
[1:50:42] internationally listening to me that was
[1:50:44] born before Jesus
[1:50:47] Christ everybody after Jesus Jus Christ
[1:50:51] in other words the trial you have to go
[1:50:53] into it Christ experience that trial
[1:50:58] first he knows the
[1:51:02] prison he knows the smell of the prison
[1:51:05] he knows the color of the prison he's a
[1:51:08] high
[1:51:09] priest that understand you
[1:51:13] [Applause]
[1:51:17] better Lord help me in Hebrew 2 verse 16
[1:51:22] the Bible say for verily he
[1:51:25] what in him the nature of what because
[1:51:29] if he takes the nature of an Angel he
[1:51:31] won't understand
[1:51:34] you an angel can cross here me and you
[1:51:38] we cannot cross if we tell an angel we
[1:51:40] cannot cross he doesn't
[1:51:42] understand so if Jesus would have taken
[1:51:45] the nature of an
[1:51:48] Angel he would not have understand me
[1:51:50] and you so he have to take your nature
[1:51:54] he has to come to your
[1:51:56] [Applause]
[1:52:02] prison he says but he took on him
[1:52:06] what human being wherefore in what all
[1:52:10] it behooves him to be made what like un
[1:52:14] not different than you and
[1:52:16] [Applause]
[1:52:18] me the PRI
[1:52:20] that they put Joseph and the prison they
[1:52:23] put the B is the same
[1:52:28] prison are we together are we together
[1:52:31] your body and the body of this man same
[1:52:41] material the same way we struggle with
[1:52:45] even lasting everything his body was
[1:52:48] subject to that
[1:52:52] one day he was even
[1:52:55] hungry and he cursed a
[1:53:00] tree so in everything he looks like you
[1:53:04] your Tri and his trial were the same but
[1:53:09] he was just trying non
[1:53:11] guilty he was innocent but we were
[1:53:16] guilty he says that in off things he beh
[1:53:21] him to be made like whatto his why that
[1:53:24] he might be a merciful and faithful high
[1:53:27] priest that he might be a what merciful
[1:53:30] and what faithful high priest in things
[1:53:33] pertaining to what God because if the
[1:53:36] high priest is not made in the same
[1:53:40] element as you he will not understand
[1:53:43] you if a pastor is not human he will be
[1:53:47] condemning you for everything
[1:53:50] but God put a pastor to be like you so
[1:53:54] when you come and talk to the pastor his
[1:53:57] heart is like your heart he understand
[1:54:01] things
[1:54:02] also he can
[1:54:05] S as a human being because he's also
[1:54:11] human do you follow me do you follow me
[1:54:14] he says that he might be what merciful
[1:54:17] and what faithful in things pering to
[1:54:20] who God to make what for the what of
[1:54:24] people so when you understand the people
[1:54:27] when you are on the same nature and the
[1:54:29] high priest himself fail when he sees
[1:54:33] the people coming with their failure the
[1:54:36] high priest won't judge too much because
[1:54:38] he remember what happened to
[1:54:41] him because Jesus Christ was in
[1:54:45] heaven in heaven he was a
[1:54:48] spirit and he turned into a logos but
[1:54:52] you cannot kill
[1:54:54] God everybody okay so Christ have to be
[1:54:58] very in flesh so he can understand you
[1:55:02] and me so when you say headache Jesus
[1:55:05] knows when you say hungry Jesus
[1:55:08] knows so your prison is the same prison
[1:55:12] he went through but he went through
[1:55:15] first that's right and he prosper in
[1:55:18] that prison
[1:55:22] there was no temptation that knocked
[1:55:24] Jesus Christ down Jesus Master every
[1:55:28] Temptation in his body he overcome
[1:55:32] everything yes sir before you were born
[1:55:36] for a purpose because he knew you're
[1:55:38] going to leave your position and you're
[1:55:40] going to go down into the dungeon when
[1:55:42] you get there you see him there and he
[1:55:45] said don't worry I was here before huah
[1:55:47] I understand your problem in three days
[1:55:50] you going to come
[1:55:52] [Applause]
[1:55:56] outall are we together he says for in
[1:56:01] that the message in that he himself has
[1:56:05] what suffer being being how temp he's
[1:56:09] able to do what that are
[1:56:13] what the way we portray Jesus Christ in
[1:56:17] Galilee it's like when Jesus was going
[1:56:20] some Holiness was sweeping the whole
[1:56:23] land the Bible says that he was tempted
[1:56:27] the same way you are tempted Jesus
[1:56:30] Christ also was tempted so Jesus didn't
[1:56:33] sin because he was the word made flesh
[1:56:36] and we byass at the
[1:56:38] offering sir but he was tempted just
[1:56:41] like you and the Bible says the reason
[1:56:45] why he was tempted like you is so that
[1:56:48] he would know how to come in your help
[1:56:52] how to secure you so when you in trouble
[1:56:55] Jesus understand that trouble and he
[1:56:58] knows when you say
[1:57:00] 911 he knows what happened to you he
[1:57:03] comes quickly to rescue you because he
[1:57:07] went there
[1:57:09] first listen to this my friend in
[1:57:12] Hebrews chapter 4 verse 14 the Bible
[1:57:15] says seeing then that we have what a
[1:57:18] great high priest that is how pass into
[1:57:20] the heav what is his name Jesus the son
[1:57:23] of God let us do what hold our
[1:57:26] confession for we have not a high priest
[1:57:29] that cannot be touched by the
[1:57:31] what but in
[1:57:34] what how many
[1:57:37] point so in other word there is no
[1:57:42] temptation that can happen to you that
[1:57:45] Jesus doesn't
[1:57:48] know amen amen
[1:57:52] internet was not in the time of Jesus
[1:57:55] uhuh but the demon of internet was there
[1:57:59] with Jesus
[1:58:03] Christ so if you struggling with inet
[1:58:06] Jesus understand the demon behind
[1:58:09] it because he was tempted in all point
[1:58:13] in other way no matter how many things
[1:58:17] the devil will manifest
[1:58:20] and bring new to make you fall none of
[1:58:24] them is new to
[1:58:26] [Music]
[1:58:27] Christ in all point two ter all teren
[1:58:32] Jesus already covered the whole
[1:58:36] Space listen to this he was tempted like
[1:58:40] who as we are yet what let us therefore
[1:58:44] come how unto the what of because the
[1:58:49] one who's sitting on the throne
[1:58:51] understands you that's why you don't go
[1:58:54] to the throne of grace like this no no
[1:58:56] no because you don't know him the one
[1:58:59] who sitting there is a human being he
[1:59:02] understand my struggle that's why devil
[1:59:04] if you think this is what is going to
[1:59:06] make me
[1:59:07] down I'm going to the throne of
[1:59:10] [Applause]
[1:59:13] grace I am going to the throne of grace
[1:59:17] how I say father look at that demon he's
[1:59:21] the one he's troubling me every day you

[1:59:27] Big Brother come and do it
[1:59:29] [Applause]
[1:59:31] again because you are the
[1:59:35] same and
[1:59:37] forever so when we approach the throne
[1:59:39] of grace how do we go B boldly that we
[1:59:44] may obtain how mercy and find what Grace
[1:59:48] to help to up
[1:59:50] [Music]
[1:59:52] when so prayer should be a
[1:59:56] privilege when you are struggling prayer
[1:59:59] is a privilege prayer is your phone call
[2:00:03] to call
[2:00:04] 911 and say big brother somebody's right
[2:00:08] here I have been battling with him I
[2:00:11] can't overcome him but I remember you
[2:00:13] were tempted in no point you remember
[2:00:17] this demon he says what is name and
[2:00:20] Jesus look he say I remember I knock him
[2:00:22] off when I was in Galilee tell him I'm
[2:00:25] coming to the rescue and the demon will
[2:00:27] walk away when he understand that the
[2:00:30] big boss is

[2:01:26] in the

[2:01:31] Bram said the reason why they give him
[2:01:32] 39 because there is 39 short of diseases

[2:01:38] of disease was on him so there is no

[2:13:40] give you the glory of the Kingdom that's

[2:14:45] from God God spoke one place in the
[2:14:48] Bible something on this line he said
