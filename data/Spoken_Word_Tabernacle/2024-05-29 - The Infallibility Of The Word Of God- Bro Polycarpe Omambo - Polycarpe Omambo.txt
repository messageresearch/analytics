you need to believe brother Bram says this someone ask him a question does it happen that after you pray for someone and the person is healed and after a while they get sick again with the same illness what does it mean and brother Bram replies as long as you have your faith if they pray for you you are healed but if you get away from Faith you must start over again that's why when we come into the house of the Lord as we approaching the Lord tonight must keep faith in the word of God amen amen amen as you standing let's go straight to our scripture in the book of act chapter 28 1-6 the book of act chapter 28 verse 1 through six can everybody okay okay the last chapter of the book of act let's read in the name of Jesus Christ [Applause] and when they were escaped then they knew that the island was called mea and the his people showed us no little kindness for they kindled a fire and receive as everyone because of the present rain and because of the cold and when Paul had gather a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire there came a viper out of the Heat and fasten on his hand and when The Barbarians saw the venomous Beast hang on his hand they said among themselves no doubt this man is a murderer whom though he has escaped the sea yet Vengeance suffer not to leave he shook off the Beast Into the Fire and felt no harm how be the look when they should have swld that when he should have sold and fallen down dead suddenly but after they had looked a great while and saw no harm come to him they change their minds and say that he was a god let's pray Heavenly Father creator of Heaven and Earth Here We Are Tonight in your presence we come to hear from thee Lord all these people came to you hear the even we ourself as Minister here we are expecting to hear from because it's written that there is no good in man so we are waiting upon so that you can do whatever you want to so that you can correct us so that you can edify us so that you can encourage us you can assist us in everything we commit this service unto the hand and we are asking for your grace we don't have any Merit on our own but we know that you took our place Lord that's why we call upon your grace tonight so that you can take the and you can speak to your people father we read your word because we went to school and we know how to read but when it come to the interpretation it's only the author may you come down and speak to your people because there are some people that have been stuck or beaten by a snake I don't know in which category of Life they have been touched and tonight they need your healing Lord Jesus we thank you for everything be with us from the beginning to the end and we rebuke every spirit that is contrary to your word may you alone take the full preeminence we also thinking about our to our sister Joan You Are the Healer for our sister the wife to our precious brother healing take place in her body no matter the case that she is in father they are those that have traveled in Africa wherever they are as they coming back we commit them onto the hand in the name of Jesus Christ amen God richly bless you you might be seated tonight I would like to speak on a subject that are titled the infallibility of the word of God amen amen amen the word of God is infallible am amen the word of God has an objective a purpose to teach to correct to instruct to build up in a good way that is the purpose of the word of God if you go to the Book of John chapter 6 verse 66 these are the word of Jesus himself after he had done so many Mir miracles did so many wonders things he gave so many advices and now he's talking to his disciples and I'm going to read it to you blessed be the word of the Lord John 6 63 the Bible says us this it is the spirit that Quicken the flesh profit nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life amen amen so there is only one place where you can find life life dwells in in the words of Jesus in the word of God am amen and the word have as a purpose as I already mentioned to teach to correct to instruct and to edify or build up that is the purpose of the word of God blessed be the name of the Lord there are certain things in our lives that you can receive from Elders you might receive it from an adult or maybe from your parents maybe you may learn it in school or among friends but other things only the word of God can give it to you only the word of God can give it to you only the word can give it eternal life only the word of God can it to no one can give you eternal life only the word of God in the book of Psalm chapter 107 verse 19 and 20 I'm going to read it quickly the Bible says this blessed be the name of the Lord Psalm 107 verse 19 listen to what God is speaking through David then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble and he said them out of their distresses now listen carefully he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions so when you have problems when you are crying unto the Lord when you are praying unto the Lord oh when you go consult a man of God he will give you the word and it's that word that will bring healing because in the word there is power in the word of God there is Deliverance amen amen that's why when they were in trouble the Bible said they cry to the Lord they did whatever they could do God never send weapon God never send money but God sent his word and the word brought Deliverance that's why I read this Psalm 107 blessed be the name of the Lord remember title the infallibility of the word of God if you just uh take such as this in the time of Noah God spoke and he instructed Noah to build an ark amen but now remember inent time also God also spoke to Noah to also build an arc in this in other words they need to store up the they need to store up the word that word that we have as the message of the glory to God so that he can deliver the people from sin so when God spoke to Noah to build an ark the people never pay attention Noah was building the ark it took years so many years and people are making for we're making fun of him it's a story that you all are with but all I wanted to point out is the infallibility of the word of God so since God already spoke that one of these days it's going to rain rain came down and God destroy everything except Noah and his family and the Beast that the lord gave instruction to preserve that species amen amen the word of God will never fail that's why Jesus could even says that everything can pass away but the word of God will never fail amen amen in the time of Abra when God visited Abraham God gave a promise to Abraham but it was not the same day he gave the promise that Abraham have a baby it took a while and Abraham was patient and the word of God was fulfilled in his own time and we are under the teaching of Joseph if you remember Joseph had dreams he had Visions it's the Lord that gave those Vision to him when he took those vision and went and spoke about when he he told about them to his brothers and to his parent believe unto those and he brought jealousy even his own father rebuke him so really you talking about me and your mother kneeling down before you amen amen and Joseph CL onto those Vision to what God showed to him he was always happy and you will notice my brother that the jealousy of his brother they could have taken him and put him in a pit try to make the word of God fair but he never worked they tried to kill him never worked they sold him he went to Egypt and from there you know the rest of the story they even took him to prison that would didn't shake his faith at all he knew what God showed him amen glory to God Amen they took him to prison and from the prison he came out he never even took him away from his path Vision when they were seeking for someone to interpret the dreams they call on to him but notice as the prophet stated somebody who has Faith he's unmovable amen amen the answer of Joseph was whoever can interpret the dream It's Only God Can inter the dream amen but now notice now the god that presented in front of Phar the god that will interpret the dream it is a man by the name of Joseph but Joseph said no one knows about the dream Only God Can interpret the dream my brother my sister when you have the word of God God you are a God God spoke in the book of Psalm that I told you that you are God even though you die like men the word of God is God himself the word of God is God himself am amen and Joseph interpreted the dream dreams which shows that he became God himself can you tell your neighbor that I'm a God because God already declared that you are a god a little C of a lion how do you call him it's a lion but if you a child of God so who do you think you are you don't know who you are you are more than able tonight you can displace every even a big even whatever is before you let me go back to my subject glory to God in the word of God we got Mir Miracles everything lays in the word of God let me read brother Bram let me read the prophet in the sermon jiah and Divine Healing 1954 February 16th paragraph 38 GL let me read brother Bram says this now you say about the GRE on on the hand well one day PA the Lord the Lord told Paul he had to go down and appear before Caesar and got a shipwreck out there and the Lord God gave him a vision the Lord told him what was going to happen 14 days and nights no star no moon nor he didn't worry Paul because he know what the Lord said Paul say I saw a vision last night a man stood by me and told me that I was going to be taken before Caesar and said the ship was going to be wreck on a certain Island but said they ain't going to be nobody's life Paul say the Lord don't told me so and Paul say we are going to be of good brother say I can see that little Jew shaking his hand and screaming to the top of his voice the Sheep just pitching as hard as he he didn't bother him he know what the Lord you see Paul have Assurance so when they got on the [Applause] shore there was a big storm being on there and the rain and he was cold and Paul was picking up some sticks and he throw some in the fire and a big dangerous snake grab him right through the hand sometime we find ourself in dangerous places you are you can find yourself in a place where there is a lot of danger but you not even aware there is a danger around you amen amen as we're going to show it to sooner grab him to the hand why he never scared Paul he look at it like that so full of the Holy Ghost all inner body was charged with the power of God he looked at it he shook it off in the fire like tonight you going to shake that snake whatever Venom of your life whatever snake of your life in every do they have beaten you they have to go back to the fire because we're going to call the holy fire tonight Hallelujah glory to God and then he shook it off and shook it off in the fire and Paul say he spoke to the snake he said I got to go before why are you bothering me Paul have the Assurance Paul got already a vision and he knows that God cannot lie God already talked to Paul Paul you will appear over there in Rome but look at what happen on the road and Paul knew everything when people were troubled in the boat Paul was calm because he knew where he was standing he knew his creator he already believe his creator and the word of creation was already in him meaning the Creator was so Paul could be shaken am amen that's why he was not afraid knew that no matter the storm tonight my brother my sister no matter the storm no matter the wind just know that your creator the creator of the storm he knows that you are in that storm knows that you are already in a strong wind he was with Peter one time when the storm was shaking the boat but Jesus was in the boat Jesus was sleeping even though the disciple were afraid but Jesus was still there he was the master the creator of the wind so just know that the wind that are happening to you it is just bringing you somewhere because brother Bram says brother Bram speak about the eego that the eego uses storm there is a lot of stor that is when the eego take off and the more he go the more he can see clearly so you are an eagle use your wing use your storm your storm of your life whatever you see as difficulty maybe in your health maybe sickness just know that God is there God is just beside you God is in you never give up and don't say anything negative from you only believe you will see the glory of God you will be healed you will come out of it blessed be the name of the Lord amen God Prov [Music] way we will read God provided way of healing paragraph 23 brother Bram says [Music] this there you are no matter how dark he got no matter how dark he got the well might have come up to turn the Sheep over the Sharks following them by hundreds by hundreds that would not Face Paul no sir he knew what God had said he believed what God has said he said well brother be of good courage for I believe God that he just be as he showed it to me there is Faith got out of the island out there and he pick up a bunch of sticks to throw on the fire and the heat got to the stick a big old snake came out and you know those kind of snake when they hit you you die only in two or three minutes you will happen it's like an African M I think you leave about two or three minutes after one B after one bite it's about as long as you can live serum or no serum and that snake grab on the hand and Paul look at it and say the Lord say I must be brought before why you couldn't hurt me and he shook him off in the fire and Paul went over and got some more stick and turn around and got warm as if nothing had ever happened see what I mean see what I mean God told Paul you are going to be brought before not yet been before so nothing fa he knew he was going on now that is fath you got your course and you know exactly where you standing now when an individual can pray till you struck that place brother there is not enough doctors in Chicago to tell you you're going to remain sick in other word when you pray so long amen amen because you know where you standing and you know unto whom you have believed blessed be the name of the Lord [Music] amen in question and answer in 1964 the 30th August the 30th brother Bram says this he said now watch Paul picking up stick on the island of I believe he was he was in chance a snake perhaps a m that is a death bite he should have fallen down right quick dead I don't know of no the snake that would kill you that quick unless it be a m and so he pick up this m we know that it's a deadly B it just got about just a few breath when a m hit you or Cobra you got the 5050 chance 50 to live with live with the cobra with a yellow Cobra you got about 80% to die and about 20% to leave but with a member you have no per you are just dead at all that's it because you don't take but just few breaths paralyzes the nerve system the blood system and everything else and you are gone see but when this m in the hand they say that man is a wicked man perhaps a murderer even though he escaped the sea he could not escape death the gods is going to Revenge him like him being a murderer Paul looked and this snake hanging on his hand he just shook it off not all excited oh Lord help me to do it no look at it shook it shook it off in the fire and went on up picking up like nothing had happened they say he shall die just in a minute because when the snake bite you you are gone but after a while time pass Paul didn't die or no effect they changed and they said he is a god that is come down in the form of a man amen see blessed be the name of the Lord tonight my brother my sister no matter your situation people also will change their opinion about you amen amen they will change their [Applause] opinion if you notice was in the island of M when he came out of the boat the Sheep he went in a people a barbarus people that's what we read tonight when he went there bar the barbarus people here it's like some country B people or the people sometime they could they could be not liking strangers or people that are not nice that are not good and when we look at the book of act 28 verse2 the Bible says and the barbar people showed us no little kindness so when Paul got there they were not too really happy the way they receive these people I don't know maybe because he was raining and he was called and that's why they didn't take care of him that's why the Bible says no little kindness and they took us closer to a fire and it was the fire that they because it was raining and it was cold now listen closely now Paul had gathered a b and lay them on the fire there are certain obligation brothers and sisters of life that put us to live in a in in a places that you find people that are barar in other words you must find yourself among people that you never desire God put that in your path when you going to work do you only have Mage there when you are in the hospital do you have message when you going to school only Christian are in school so those are the obligation of life God always some put us there in our life to go through that and Paul found himself in such a place he was among barbarous people and everybody was trying to warm themselves up and when Paul when Paul look he looked at the fire the fire was not too strong and he was not strong enough for everybody in other word I cannot be among I mean benefit from the fire without bringing my own input to it bring my own contribution to the fire so Paul went and got some stick to and watch what happened now it is not the snake or I mean the stick that Paul brought that had it glory to God those people were there when Paul put the sticks in the fire got bigger and the heat got really strong and the serpent the snake came out from the fire and now notice with me those people were living with a danger right there they never knew that a m was there were not long enough to decode that member maybe they were not praying enough brother say You must read your in you must read it in the night before you go to bed you must you must when Paul Paul begin to bring his contrib and we can tap it as the input of Prayer of prayer into the fire when the prayer of fire come demon cannot stand and the demon is a snake the devil here is a snake in other words the sickness you have it's a demon you have a demon probably you not aware you seek and these people have a danger they were not aware of the danger they had a m right there only Paul have to come to find it and when Paul put his contribution and then the fire went up then the snake pop up that's why we saw this and Paul have GA of and laid them on the fire and a VAP out of the heat fasten on his hand like tonight I don't know which sickness you have by the fire of Pray by the heat of the word of God that snake must come out my snake must leave your body that snake must leave your life I don't know which domain of your life that there is a hidden snake maybe it's in your business maybe it's on your marriage is a snake hidden

swallow your work you going to apply here and there you are very smart but nobody pick you up and the people that you are more intelligent than them they hire them but not you but they can't hire you because there is a snake somewhere that there is a m sitting there there is a danger right there that you're not aware of and that danger it might be in your family it might be in your life but so I don't know where they are hiding what that but tonight you must increase the fire so that the snake can leave he must live that snake he was a danger and those people were not aware of a permanent danger it's like people are living with a lot of danger around them they don't even they are not aware if Paul was not there maybe that's sake would have caused a lot of Damages hallelujah hallelujah a Viper came out of the heat the prate trouble that you have must come out by the fire of God Amen if it's a female trouble he must come out by the fire PR you will read with you in PSM when they cry unto the Lord God never sent a weapon he never sent money but God sent his word and that word deliver tonight where you are the word must reach you and deliver you from sickness amen amen hallelujah and fasten unto his hand here there is a snake that came and clung unto the hand of PA maybe your Works maybe your business a certain maybe in your engagement something is stuck maybe you going through a coach and suddenly for some reason somebody turn around and go get somebody else what happen again there is a snake sitting right there there is a snake right there all he's doing is swallowing everything because what a snake does is just swallowing you do something after a while money goes and you're not going nowhere let's go to prayer let's get some sticky so that that snake can come out and he can be burned that snake it's probably eating something from you you get pregnant somewhere miscarriage miscarriage uhh there is a snake somewhere who's trying to destroy I don't know where that snake you know where the snake is so tonight let's get to business so that we can send some fire because Paul Paul Kindle the fire and the snake came out and look and the Snake look at where is the origin of my trouble that's why he identifi Paul that's why he went to Paul and clung unto him many trouble and fight you have in your life in your life maybe you are the person that God chose to take in charge the family in prayer and you will realize you will be the one being fought the most our fight comes only to you all the fight are directed to you let me tell you tonight you are on the good path feel not all I can tell you is get into prayer Everything Will Change the seed will be changed Hallelujah glory to God [Applause] I'm in verse four when the Barbarian saw the venomous being beast hung on they say among themselves no doubt this is a murderer whom though he has escaped the sea yet Vengeance suffer not to leave you will notice people around you they always wait on something wrong to happen in your life these people were with Paul instead of securing or coming to help for them they are sitting watching so that they can see the distru of sometime in your life when you start a business to think are your friend they are waiting for you to fall they are waiting for you to fail am amen you will notice I believe it's in the book of Luke I believe Luke n or maybe 10 I'm not sure now uh it's spoken of that sometime enemy in enmity might come from your family amen amen and that's where people get their enemies sometime sometime it's the people of your own family amen so what happened bad friends amen amen they were waiting for Paul to die they forgot that I believe it's in the book of Luke 10 Jesus says this as you also you forget says this I gave you the power to walk upon the snake and the Scorpion and upon all the power of the enemy and nothing should harm you amen amen amen amen it's already written this people but Paul knew in Psalm 91 verse 10 the Bible says this they shall no evil be theee neither shall any plag come nigh th dwelling amen [Music] amen you might be in a wind or in a storm as Paul found himself in God already gave us some prescription and those prescription are his word when you cling to those prescription nothing will harm you amen amen nothing will happen to you let me move a little bit forward Glory blessed be the name of the Lord I'm going to read verse five and he shook off the Beast Into the Fire and felt no harm as I said it the serpent looked at who caused my trouble and he attacked the man to the hand of Paul and Paul never stood still but he shook his hand so you are so must shake your hand you know the part of the body that the snake have bit you you know the area that have been affected that the snake attack you amen amen you must shake that area you must shake it off because he will go back to the fire he will go back to the fire verse six they look when he should have swen or fallen down dead suddenly that's what I told you you might be around people you think they're friend or maybe your family sometime they are the one waiting for a curse to happen to you how can they be in the same place but for them they were expecting to see Paul falling dead so that he can die because as we read brother brother with the vness of this snake only two three few breath you go but let me tell you this my brother I don't know what no matter that sickness that problem that you have even if your problem usually kill people you have a different prescription your prescription is you will not die even if other that sickness usually kill people it's a death sentence it's not going to be a death sentence for you amen even if there sicknesses in you I don't know the condition it is maybe it's a maybe it's a cancer even some many people die with you will not die just as Paul was not dead we see an exception Paul was an exception when the snake beat him he left the Venom so why was not the same thing will happen to you if you are in the hospital even you are in Affliction or maybe you here you sick or maybe a family member sick just bring your faith just lift up your hand and this hand will represent the the stick you going to throw in the fire it is showing the power of God it's going to be remember as a prayer that's an offering unto the Lord that God is able to burn everything even if it's in your body in your soul in your spirit I don't know what kind the venomous you have in your body maybe you are walking smelling medication all over even when you go to the bathroom you smell medication even when you eat you still smell medication too because they put you under a lot of medication when everybody is cold you are always hurt because of something in your no matter what is happening in your back God is able tonight to heal you to deliver you you are not that race that can be dying with that sickness you not any kind of race that can be taken off by any situation you're not that kind of that can take you because of such a problem whatever problem is I don't know what it is remember you don't belong to that race that can be taken off by trouble amen you won't die your enemy will change their opinion they will change their opinion what are they saying here but after they had looked great for a while and so no harm come to to him they change their minds your enemy will change their mind in whichever domain when they see you failing here you're not able to do this you're not able to do that they will change their language because you have a God the god that we have it's a god of Miracle meaning God does things that we are not able to do where we are St that is where God start let me tell you something many time we fa because of this do you know why usually we look at our own intelligence we look at our own finan when we look at what we have we say okay I'm I'm able to do this I can reach this and as long as you are believing or or depending on yourself and you are not depending on God you will fail that's why we fail but as the pastor always say put your car in you meaning [Applause] what we on the grace of God just say this Lord I'm not able to do this I'm not able to reach this but I'm waiting for thee and I'm depending on your grace when you depend on the grace of God the way God will come and change the SC to take you from where you are to where you could never expect it will be a testimony for you tonight because he's a god of mirac God will do things that we are not able to do he will do things that we are not able to do musician you can come in I'm sorry because I went up on my time I don't think so he is the same God tonight your enemy will change their language they will change their language what is the problem the PE these people when they were living with this danger they never kindled the fire in Isaiah 42 verse 22 and Isaiah 5721 the Bible says there is no peace say my God to the wicked am amen but how can the wicked be in peace Bes you it means something is not correct because the snake was there in peace and The Barbarians were living but the snake was already a danger living there it took Paul to be in that place and what did Paul do he increased the intensity of the fire of the fire like tonight in your life tonight begin to increase the fire increase your pray your your and you will see that snake coming out that snake that is sitting in your life in the domain of your life on your business on your in your children or whatever it is sitting in or what is troubling you that snake will come out that snake will come out and he will be burned because the Bible says the Bible says that the fire consum the fire will burn continually upon the altar upon the altar so meaning upon the altar of the lord we must have fire continually in other words in the morning you read your Bible you start praying and then you get some fire at no you pray no matter where you are you just remember to pray anytime you going to be on fire and when the fire is kindled the enemy cannot stand the enemy cannot come near that tonight you must remember that you are a child of God you are a God and your enemy must change your testimony they must say that this is a god they spoke for Paul that Paul was a god God bless [Applause] [Music] you amen amen glory be to the name of the [Music] Lord Glory to God I believe the Lord spoke to each person tonight amen Paul got into this island he never planned about it they got a shipwreck and he didn't know he was going to that island and if you read the rest of the story Paul even ministered to the people in that island and the people begin to get healed it was God path to take him through that it looks like it's a shipwreck it looks like it's trial after trial we got the vision we're going to appear before Caesar but 14 days no night no moon no star under a storm and a shipwreck and after shipwreck you are saved you say Lord let me breathe a little bit and you get there you find some barbarus people that were nice the Bible says and they Kindle the fire for you you say praise be to the name of the Lord you are Jehovah Jara you provided a company the people that don't know me look how they treating me I got a flat tire in this neighborhood look at how this person is coming bringing me everything asking me do you need water do you need this can I call my husband can we jump you you say God thank you very much and you want to bring your contribution to that and guess what a member have I done something wrong have I se somewhere that's right that's right maybe there is a sin that I have not confessed but I remember confessing everything I remember even telling you God that if there is anything that I forgot that I don't remember forgive me because I can't recall everything that I have done you have not done anything God is in control amen that snake was a danger and that snake is taken care of tonight because the Lord sent his word and when his word come it's to bring healing so Take 5 minute because I believe he finish on time pray for yourself L get some stick tonight increase that prayer a little bit tonight don't be just quick to leave and to Fellowship outside when an anointing like this come take an opportunity point to him those snake those trouble area those difficulty that domain don't worry about me pray for
