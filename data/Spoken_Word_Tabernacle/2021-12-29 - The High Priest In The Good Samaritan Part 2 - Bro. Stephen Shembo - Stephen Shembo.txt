sitting there i couldn't really i was in pain i was feeling pain around my body i could barely stand up so when i got up i went outside and i was still in pain and always anything everything that was going on my mind was asking god to help me and when i asked god to send someone to help me when i was outside by myself it it did a deacon came and he brought me inside and when right before when the service ended the pastor was preaching um the pastor came and he started praying for me and everybody else that was there also started praying i started felt feeling my pain started to multiply multiply and my pain got extremely bad then all of a sudden i felt something in my stomach just dropped then after church we went to the emergency um based on what everybody else was telling me i could have ended up having a surgery but each time i kept drinking water and can't go into the bathroom the pain kept getting lighter and lighter and i wasn't feeling pain each time i went at first i couldn't even get up when i went to the emergency but as time went by when i was praying in my heart jesus made it so my pain can diminish little by little until the point where they did um a test on my blood on my urine and everything and everything came out negative i only had one issue but that wasn't something it wasn't a big deal so i stayed inside the hospital since service was done all the way till midnight but it took them forever before they can call me so i can go over there and so they can treat me and so they can tell me what i have but thanks to the lord god he's he helped me while they were busy helping other people he put me first while they were helping other people so i just want to thank god for that because he spared me from having to take surgeries and i want to thank everybody else who kept me in prayers amen brother freddie could you come least in a word of prayer this evening i didn't receive any written request yeah brother freddie sister um amen pray for traveling mercy's there did anybody else have a pr unspoken request amen we believe god can heal through surgery but we also believe he can heal without surgery so and we like that option better it's cheaper and easier right so uh if anybody has a prayer request on their heart this evening they could just make it known by the uplifting of their hand an unspoken request you all may be seated as they come angela you know i'm grateful for uh to be in church this evening and and i say that almost every wednesday but i see a lot of churches are canceling again and they're starting to go remote or they had meetings scheduled and they cancel them because it's like the new wave of coveted and different things and i'm grateful to be able to gather together with my brothers and sisters and to

preaching sing all the way until we enter the new year amen we have a lot to thank god for amen blessed be the name of the lord let's go to our scripture tonight i believe the kids are out of school right so no pressure amen amen let's go to first samuel amen [Laughter] chapter 22 how many are up to date with the sermon let me see your hand okay okay amen if you're missing something i am not to blame it's on youtube amen yeah because everything we're going through now it's building one after the other in other words if you miss one you're gonna have a trouble on the second one if you miss three three four three four five sermon then you really really really really in trouble amen then you'll be sitting here and wondering what are we talking about first samuel chapter 22 if you're there you can say amen david we know about david right about the temple and the priesthood and everything now you're already clear david therefore departed from there and escaped to the cave a dylan and when his brethren and all his father's house heard it they went down there to him you might be seated so we found david here escaped from seoul and there is something strange about david that we already spoke about it we know that the priesthood came through the lineage of liver but for some reason we seen david behaving in a different way david went and built the temple and god didn't do anything against that david went and then ate the showbread nothing happened and later on down the road you will notice that david also went and wore even the line and effort in other words he went and put up the priestly garment and nothing happened to him amen what is wrong with david because the priest should come through liver but this is a man from judah amen but in the new testament when we went through melchizedek we found out that the priesthood would have to come through judah amen now we understand what's going on so david here departed from israel when he escaped from israel the bible says that his brethren and all his father house heard it and they went down there to him verse two and everyone that was in water not everybody that was healthy everybody here everybody that was in distress come out and everyone that was in depth were you in debt before were you in debt you thought you were not in debt because you don't owe the bank you had a big big big debt that you owe and you could not pay you needed someone to take care of that debt amen so everybody that was in debt come on and everyone that was discontent in other words bitterness of soul bitterness of soul everybody that was not happy discontent amen gather themselves to him and he became a captain over them and they were with him about 400 men so beside his family some other people came in but it seems like everybody that followed david was in trouble everybody here everybody amen you will think it's healthy people it's people that are wealthy people that don't have any problem people that have 800 points in their credit score [Music] those are not the people that follow david they stay in israel those that follow david have bad credit bad debt not happy with the government the people in trouble they're suffering people why only the tribal people are attracted to david what is in david that attract people that have trouble amen amen this david that built the tabernacle this david that went and ate the showbread that he was not allowed for um he was not lawful to eat this david that was the priest government this david i even received the revelation of melchizedek abraham met melchizedek but the one who knew that jesus christ is going to be the high priest was david this man is the man that when he leave israel when he was in israel he was working for saul he was uh faithful with soul he did everything that was fine still they didn't like him amen but when he left israel going to the gender amen anybody here i hope you're awake as he's going to the gender for some reason his anointing is attracting people that are in trouble amen amen not good people those people that go to church every time amen his anointing attracted the smoker amen amen his anointing is attracting the drunkard there is something about david ever here that when a drunker see him he feel like i can talk to david [Music] let's go to matthew amen [Music] put your head in the bubble my friend if you don't read your bible you'll be lost every time you get here we say something your gps is already lost is it saying me you're not reading the bible amen and i taught somebody when you're reading the bible don't be reading the same place over and over because some people have a tendency up in the bible and do this and do this and they keep falling on the same spot amen that's not the way you read your bible take a decision you say i'm going to read the book of roman go roman 1 roman 2 roman 3 roman 4 roman 5 all the way to roman 10 i mean 16 you finish it then you say check let's go back what else tatters take titles and then you move on you say exodus if you do that you will discover things that you never thought was written in the bible but if you only read the psalm to pray i know some of you are i know what i'm talking about amen i'm like david i know amen you only read the psalm when you tie it psalm everybody some only the new testament they don't understand what's going on and we showed you that god hide himself in numerology in numbers in genealogy if even if you don't understand it just read it anybody care when we will get to the priest in the temple i will let you read certain scripture at home and when you read your head will be spinning like what does this mean amen and when you're going to be sitting here lord's willing and we begin to afford the scripture you will never see the old testament the same way amen when they say five cubit to cubit eight cubit you'll begin to remember that there is a message he did if a piece of lever can bring all this priesthood out just one piece of furniture we're still unloading what do you think is in the entire tabernacle but you don't want to read about it amen oh my matthew it looks like i'm on sunday matthew 9. brother kerry bear with me matthew 9 verse 9. if you're there you can say amen david departing from israel david because david was a light amen amen do you know that amen one time david went into battle and he fainted about here and the enemy wanted to kill him then his guard appear and rescue him and they told him that from now on no more you go into war let us go to war you stay there because we don't want to go read your scripture and give me the answer ever here everybody here we don't want to put out something from israel amen so when he departed because the anointing of god already left soul okay that anointing was put on david anybody here then an evil spirit went to seoul and back here so when that anointing was put on god was going with david so now that anointing of the king left israel the kingly anointing hey america the king of the jews his anointing left israel and as his anointing is going out everybody that is in trouble amen love that anointing amen matthew chapter 9 verse 9 amen and as jesus passed forth from there he saw a man named matthew sitting at the receipt of custom in other words in a tax office and he says to him follow me and he arose and followed him verse 10 and he came to pass as jesus sat at meat he said a table to eat everybody start to eat as jesus sat and meet in the house behold few publicans somebody's awake thank god how many republican [Music] many publicans many publicly publicans are good people right you need to raise your bible [Laughter] many publicans and christians came a message has already been preached many publicans and who [Music] what is in jesus that attracted these guys [Music] many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciple so when you look at him you say that's god in human flesh so when you look around god in human flesh you hardly see christian you see the people that rob you the people that lied the people that cheated the people that were prosecuted [Music] amen is this really a holy man amen amen and when the pharisee in the message saw it they say to his disciple i say to the message don't say but it's even added because somebody's looking for trouble when the pharisee saw it they say to his disciple why eat your master with publicans and sinners can a priest eat with a publican based on description can a levat eat with publicans there's only one person remember we're in the good samaritan amen only one person can approach him nobody else anybody here why eat your master with and sinners but when jesus heard that he said to them day that be whole in other words the people that are healthy everybody here they that behold need not a physician in other words the healthy people do not go to the doctor amen but dead that are water so according to jesus publican and sinners are sick people people in trouble hey mark here verse 13. but go you and learn what that means i will have mercy mercy this is a scripture jesus is telling them go to the old testament and open the old testament if you search the old testament in hosea chapter 6 verse 6 i gave you the scripture you will see over there there is a scripture that hosea the prophet said and hosea said ever here i will have mercy and not water there is two things here one of them is mercy hey marquee versus sacrifice anybody care sacrifice is speaking about the law are we okay which is speaking about the levitical priesthood showing you that this priesthood is already in trouble because christ came amen i will have mercy and not sacrifice for sacrifice for i am not come to call the who but who to water [Music] amen my ministry when i'm moving i'm there to catch sinners people that are in trouble those are the people that follow david amen let's go to luke chapter 10. this is our man scripture and i'm going to read portion of it because that's where we're going to try to reach tonight if you're there you can say amen look chapter 10 verse 30. amen hallelujah and jesus answering say a certain man you remember this on sunday went down he was not going up because when you going up you are progressing right when you're moving from level one to level two level three all the way we're saying that you are growing up but this man is kind of backsliding going backward a man was going down from jerusalem to jericho and fell among thieves you remember sunday which number one strip him of his when men come out and wounded him come on and departed leaving him half dead remember sunday and by chance there came down a certain priest you remember now remember sunday a certain priest that way and when he saw him he passed by on the other side a marquee and likewise a leaver we have a priest now and a leaver you remember on sunday now right you know who is a priest who is a leaver and a leaver likewise when he was at the place came and looked on him and passed by on the other side but a certain samaritan amen why is samaritan the first group is a christian oliver the second group the second man that came in is the samaritan because the priest and the levite behave the same way their behavior ever care was the same this look go to the other side look go to the ass they repeated the same thing amen but a certain samaritan as he journey came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him what is compassion amen this man no mercy no mercy but this one shows compassion there is something in this man that attract him to bad cases but these two don't handle bad cases this one love bad cases this one love bad cases amen in other words when it's a mess that's when his anointing begin to work did you hear me when everything is fine he's choked [Music] brother branham said god love to display his power [Applause] amen here brother branham said he usually was had a tendency to take his children and put him on his lap and then he showed them his muscles and they say look daddy you have big muscles but i'm saying he loved that everybody and he said god also wanted to show his muscles but to show myself they got to be a fight so when fight comes then god is jumping because it's an opportunity for him to display his power [Music] why should i give you a healing anointing when you see you're here when you are healthy anybody here wait when brother jm get sick then when the lord heal him you will never teach him about divine healing nobody can take that away everybody here he would never knew the power of god in that aspect until troubles come let's pray heavenly father lord once again we are approaching you humbly tonight father thanking you for your grace for your love and your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father you have given us another opportunity to be here tonight with sense of like precious faith lord father to share the things that belong to the kingdom of god lord we have done everything that a man can do this is the best that i can based on the ability you have given me but when it comes to interpret your word to bless your children and to give a revelation that takes the supernatural act of the holy spirit father therefore i ask that you move me completely out of the way may you come down and you speak to your children bless them and remember the sacrifice they have done father to drive tonight coming to your house wow there could be many reason that could befriend them and make them sit home lord we commit them unto the hand may you be the beginning and the ending do you find the omega of this service father in the name of jesus christ amen god richly bless you we are dealing with the high priest in the good samaritan on sunday that was part one because we could not finish now we are on part two everybody clear we saw on sunday that when we talked about the priesthood we had two lineage in the priesthood we have the natural lineage in the priesthood which was the levitical priesthood el barca and then in the spiritual side we have what we call the melchizedek priesthood every case so far we establish on sunday based on the scripture that the levitical priesthood have priests which is from which are from the lineage of aaron amen and leave that which were giving to aaron as an offering to help him so they leave out were the helpers of the priest and we say that every priest is a leaver remember that but every level is not a priest because to be priest number one you must be a leaver and number two you must come from the lineage of aaron alone if you are from another family you are still a levite you can help into the tabernacle but you are not a priest ever here so far now we moved and we saw that first of all god wanted the entire nation of israel to be preached then god pulled the firstborn from there and because of the sin of israel god rejected the firstborn and went into the family of liver and then pulled from there the priesthood so going with the natural lineage we have israel first that was given the chance then from israel he moved to the family of liver and back here then inside the family of liver he pulled aaron amen ever here so from israel they pull liver from liver they pull aaron and aaron became the first high priest amen ever here which was a type of jesus christ ever care so far in psalm chapter 1 37 uh chapter 135 the bible says this in verse 19 bless the lord o house of israel ever here bless the lord o house of who ever here bless the lord o house of hope anybody okay anybody okay god is requiring he need worship and god is bringing a commandment and when he's bringing the commandment he said you house of israel ever care bless the lord and back here are you in israel are you a jew then he move on he said house of who aaron bless the lord were you born from the family of aaron he turned around he said house of liver ever here bless the lord [Music] bless the lord house of israel bless the lord house of liver bless the lord house of aaron where are we me and you [Music] did you see that did you see that somebody catch it bless the lord house of israel jews bless the lord house of aaron jews bless the lord house of liver jew ever here so these three is telling you we are dealing with the levitical priesthood but there is another priesthood which is the priesthood of melchizedek and the mercedes-area there is no jews and there is no gender ever here melchizedek works with predestination as long as you have a predestination seed it doesn't matter whether you are a jew whether you are an american whether you are an african whether you are a european whether you are an indian merchandise doesn't go by the bloodline merchandiser that goes by the spiritual bloodline the predestinated seed that was planted in you before the foundation of the world ever here so bless the lord have of israel jews house of aaron jews house of liver jews but watch this he that do water bless who how many feel the lord [Applause] ever care so far so right here you can see the two priesthood locked ready and the opening of the seven seal the bible became a new book in acts 2 verse 5 the bible says and they were dwelling in jerusalem jews devout men god fearing men everybody out of water out of every nation under heaven so under heaven out of every nation jews were scattered already so they came for the feast now when this was noise abroad when the holy ghost came on the day of pentecost the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language so some of the jews departed from israel they went into gentile country and the children were born there and when those children were born they were jew by blood but the language that they grew up with was no more the jewish language it was the language of the country that they were born in everybody so far and all they were um and they were all amazed and marveled saying one to another behold are not all these which speak galileans these are true jews everybody here and how here we every man in our own tongue where when we were born that's the country they were born portion and midis illamites and the dwellers is made in mesopotamia and in judea in cappadocia in pontus and asia francia pamphilia in egypt in the part of libya which is in africa about sarin in africa and strangers of rome jews and who a proselyte is a gentile that have believed the jewish religion anybody no problem and queen is an arabian we do hear them speak in our tongue the wonderful work of who [Music] at the beginning over there everybody spoke one language everybody okay we came from adam and dada may even even go back fourth and fourth and set all the way there everybody spoke one language so when god brought the flood and destroyed the entire world ever here after that noah came out from the ark and noah was speaking one language with his entire family then from now the earth began to multiply again so nimrod came and the nimrod came with the idea that maybe one day again if we do something that is wrong god is going to punish us again with the flood and brother branham said that's why he came up with a plan to build the tower of battle in order that when the flood comes everybody will go into the tower climb up there and when the flood is finished we become back against sinner you go up sinner you come back sooner and god haraf is going to destroy is not going to reach you everybody here so when god look at the unity of man a wrong unity to accomplish something god came and confronted the language everybody here so you can speak you think you are speaking in your language but the one who's understanding you is understanding another language everybody here in other words god disturb the interpretation amen i'm going slowly are we okay are we okay because there was a false unity under a force head which brought confusion and it was something that was against the word of god but on the day of pentecost because jesus said it is expedient for me to go because if i stay here i cannot send the holy ghost back into you i cannot send melchizedek back into you ever here when melchizedek came there ever here when merchandise enter into the disciple you don't need the translation anymore amen ever here the disciples were speaking in galileans everybody but when they speak in english the one whose understanding does not understand english he is understanding english translated by the holy ghost in their own language that's why if you die today and you go to the sixth dimension don't worry about english if you don't speak english if you see brother branham there you won't need the translation over there [Music] ever here you will be speaking just the language you think you are speaking and brother branham will hear you just as you speak in english [Applause] [Music] oh my god blessed be the name of the lord brother branham say and then division left he had a patient a spanish lady and the little girl turned to the interpreter and said in spanish i thought he could not speak spanish so brother branham had a girl sitting there speaking spanish and brother branham had an interpreter so brother branham was speaking to the interpreter and the vision broke and brother branham was sucked into the vision completely and when brother branham got into the vision under the anointing of the holy spirit brother branham began to speak in spanish everybody but the interpreter of brother branham heard brother i'm speaking in english do you hear me amen are we okay about the spanish girl heard brother branham speaking in spanish then the girl turned to the interpreters say wait a minute i thought you told me the prophet doesn't speak spanish jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever ever here now you understand the background i thought he could not speak spanish and the interpreters say you spoke english didn't you brother branham i said i did he said well she said you spoke spanish i said brother branham stop the recorder anybody here all along the road and they stop and we play it back and every word was and then we had her to repeat what i said when they listen to the tape english they say wait a minute you say you heard me speaking in spanish right sit down there write everything that i spoke in spanish anybody here and then we heard her to repeat what i said and as long as the vision was going on she heard every word in water why i hear we every man in our own tongue where when we were in other words back again to pentecost god is still god now when i begin to say word within myself she didn't understand that at all but the holy spirit speaking english was interpreting it to her in what god is good he's a good god as aura robert blessed certainly is water so if you have a problem with translation go back to that god he is still in power to open your ears to open your heart so you can understand the language of god [Applause] everybody here you won't you don't have to worry in the rapture when we meet one another in a rapture you will be talking a language and abraham will hear you jacob we hear you jesus we hear you brother branham we hear you because the language that unity is back again under the headship of the holy spirit ever cares for that is the image of melchizedek and everybody that was in jerusalem feared god and back here there were jews and they were also gentile in act 10 first one there was a certain man in caesarea called cornelius a gentile a centurion of the band called the italian man a devout man and one day of the water was he a jew yeah fear god praise the lord hey back here under melchizedek you have jews and you have also who you have gentiles ever here and the man filled god with all his house which gave much arm to the people and prayed to god always a gentile man everybody here now in hebrew on sunday we stopped here we found out that paul said but year come unto mount zion and unto the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem not the earthly the heavenly because melchizedek is king of jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angel to the general assembly and the church of the first remember the priesthood here aaron was the firstborn everybody here you remember on sunday but on our side on melchizedek the firstborn of god the beginning of the creation of god was jesus christ now the church not of the first borns plural but singular the church of the firstborn one the firstborn in other words the church of jesus christ here because jesus is the firstborn he is the beginning of the creation of god and the firstborn is what god was looking for in egypt he said bring me the firstborn that's going to be my priest here now the bible said the church of christ or the church of the firstborn which is the bread of jesus christ it's a birth by a man just like adam gave birth to evil ever here by another way not a natural way so join the church of the firstborn comma which are written in heaven [Music] lord help me when we say written in heaven what does it mean the bible said in luke 10 verse 20 notwithstanding in this rejoice not jesus called the disciple and gave them the power of unclean spirit and he sent them go preach the gospel and he sent them including judah so they went and began to cast out devils and do all kind of miracles so when they came back everybody was rejoicing lord you know what we see miracle devils were going left and right and everything they were rejoicing and jesus look at them he said i understand but let me tell you something do not rejoice on this about here notwithstanding in this rejoice not that the spirit has subject unto you that's not what is really important because the anointing at the end time can do the same thing but here lord have we not cast devil in your name have we not prophesy in your name that's not what is matter because somebody can do that and go to hell that one don't measure on that one back here because when nicodemus came to jesus christ he said lord we heard we know we heard that you are doing all the miracles jesus never comment on that he looked at him he said you must be born again don't talk to me about miracle we need to talk about the birth about here so he said in that the spirit are subject unto you we just none but rather we just because your name are written well in heaven brother brother interpret this scripture he says the book of life is definitely located in heaven and will appear at the great white throne judgment in these verses jesus says that their name were written in water in heaven they were written in the book of life for that is where names are so the book in heaven that contained name is the book of life because there are many books in heaven but the one that keeps the name of the people is the book of life so when they say your name are written in heaven it doesn't mean that when you go to heaven you're going to see your name everywhere it's telling you that in heaven there is a book and the book have name and inside that book your name is there ever here so brother branham said so the book were written in the book the name were written in the book of life for that is when names are placed jesus was speaking to the 70 verse 17 but he was also speaking to the 12 verse 23 these had all been rejoicing that devils were subject to them to them in jesus name christ with john there was rejoice not that spirit are subject to you but rather that your name are written in heaven where the book of life paul branham pulled something now he said you will not hear that judah was one of those who are casting out devils in jesus name but we know that he was a devil the son of water so when we come back here they say to the general assembly and the church of the firstborn which are written in heaven but in heaven judah also was written there is judah part of the church of god [Music] watch the scripture and to god the judge of all and the spirit of water made water so you must be part of the just people that god brought unto perfection [Music] hallelujah brother branham say don't you see it is the holy ghost brother that is when you enter into the finished work if you have been justified that's all right that's good if you've been sanctified that's good but when you receive the water the holy ghost it's a finished work and god has completed his plan of salvation and seal it with the baptism of the water amen oh my how many believe it the holy ghost in every place in the bible is a finnish worker and god completed his work he called his disciple by justification he sanctified them in john 17 17 gave them power against unclean spirit they went out and cast out devils and come back rejoicing he said don't rejoice because you cast out devils and they are subject to you but rejoice that your name is written in water i want to ask you something now my brother if your name is written in heaven is that still good no sir no indeed judas was right with water so your name being written in heaven doesn't finish the trouble anybody care the only way your name can be other trouble is in the book of life there is two sections there is the book of life marquee and the lamb's book of life and the lamb's book of life is the section that only contained the bride of jesus christ america so having your name in heaven that fan by having your name in the lamb's book of life it is telling you that you came out of jesus christ ever here so far blessed be the name of the lord he said to the general assembly the church of the firstborn the church of jesus christ which is the brother ever here how do you enter into that brother hebrew are ephesian too for through him jesus christ we have both accessed by water one spirit unto the water now therefore you are normal stranger and foreigner but fellow citizen with the saint and of the household of water you're getting the spirit of god that's what determined that truly you are a son of god but here for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body where they will be what melchizedek amen here ever here that's under melchizedek everybody here if leviticus you got to be a jew a one body whether we be jews or gender whether we be water or water paul is saying jews and gentile and he used bond and free go to galatians 4. go to galatians 4 22. oh my god this is wednesday's surgery galatians 4. verse 22 we wear this on saturday bond and free everybody here if you dare you can say amen so it is written that abraham had how many sons two sons they won by her bond made they added by water watch here bond and what now you understand what paul is saying in other words the bond were the jews and the free were the gentiles the jews or the gentiles or those that were bond in bondage and those that were free listen closely verse 23 but he who was of the bound woman was born after the those are the jews but he of the free woman was by water no sex everybody here verse 24 which thing where an allegory it was just only a tap was an allegory for these are the two covenant the one from de monsana the jews the law which gender the bondage the lord put you in prison in bondage which is ego verse 25 for this edgar is most sana in arabia an answer to jerusalem natural which is now which now is and is in what bondage with her water the jews are in bondage today but we are not in bondage anybody here verse 26 but jerusalem which is what which is above is what this is not a new job it's a heavenly jerusalem the church of the firstborn the heavenly jerusalem the general assembly because the gathering must be in shallow he said jerusalem which is above is free which is the mother it's a city of us oh about here the bible says here that by one spirit we are all baptized into one body the body of christ the church of the first born whether we be jew or gentile whether we be burned the jews or free the gender and have been all made to drink into water one spirit not two different holy ghosts ever here and grieve not the holy spirit whereby your water until the day of water so this spirit not only do you drink of it but it serves you it tells you that your work with god is finished everybody cares so far so brother branham saying the message test he said now notice jerusalem the word jerusalem is from above right back here the bible said which is the mother of us all and christ is our what who carried the pregnancy of evil who birthed the church back here because to pull if they have to cut adam and pull him out and to pull the bread they have to put jesus to sleep at the cross and cut jesus and open up because jesus is your mother he's the one that gives birth to you that's why paul say i'm traveling in pain remember on sunday ever here he said christ is our mother jesus is everything to you he is your redeemer he is your god he is your king he is your mother he is your protector he is your lamb he's your sacrifice he's your temper he's everything [Applause] ever here christ is our mother we realize that god is our water for we are born of him and if the sun therefore shall make you free you shall be water that's why you are free because the sun have met you and has free you that's why you are not under bondage anymore but you are of the free woman ever cares of her blessed be the name of the lord brother branham said he could not be held with ishmael the seed of bronze woman because of the doubting sarah doubted god's word that god was able to keep it notice abraham you see what i'm building on for sunday morning abraham did not water abraham married to sarah who doubted the promise so the child came from which birth isaac came from who from a man faith not a woman's faith back here because sarah doubted the promise now the man is giving birth amen amen by faith and back here sarah did daddy she was the one he was not adam that doubted he was if that doubted the second adam is christ here it is a birth by the spoken word about here so then we shall find more about those as we pick it up sunday morning neither can the spiritual the natural behavior with the spiritual no more can ishmael children be here with the children of isaac with the as a children and no more that then the colonel can bear with the spiritual brother branham continue he said church natural church spiritual there is a church natural that these women here type and there is a church spiritual also so the natural church and the spiritual church cannot be aired together they are two different separate times two different separate people under two different separate water that is why the rapture is different [Music] and will only be for the water it cannot come by the natural corner seed of the church is i have to be the royal seed of the word of god through who the royal seed that is why the rapture has to be water and then the foolish virgin will come later amen right here because the first one that goes out is the bread of jesus christ the other one will come after we already finished after a thousand years and the rest of the dead leave not for a thousand water because they don't go in the honeymoon only the bride goes in the millennium everybody here so far i hope you're soaking this therefore they will not be held together they shall not be in the rapture together there is absolutely a church natural and a church spiritual a church colonel and a church spiritual there is no judgment to the royal spiritual predestinated seed of abraham for they are predestinated to water they have accepted god provided sacrifice and that sacrifice which was hoped the water so when you receive the message of the hour you are justified never to be judged anymore straight to god to the heaven and you are a candidate for the rapture hallelujah hallelujah the bible said in john 21 but when the morning was now come jesus stood on the show after the resurrection but the disciple knew not that he was jesus then jesus said unto them disciples why is he calling the disciple children how many disciples jesus have one of them was judah judah was whom a devil and jesus said to all that the father gave me i have lost none of them except one his name is judah the son of perdition so when judah went and killed himself when jesus came back to the disciple he began to call them children he didn't call them children when judah was there because judah was not his child he did it after the resurrection after he paid the price he went to hell he came back up went to heaven the sacrifice accepted he came down the remaining are correct he said now children they didn't become children they were already children but he unfolded that revelation after his sacrifice was accepted in heaven judah is no more there now i don't call you disciple children children have ye any meat and they answer him no in romans 8 verse 17 the bible say if children then we are water heirs of who enjoyed hair with who brother the bride you and your husband joint amen are you filing your taxes joint joint joint but here john tell with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be water for whom he did he also did water to be water to the image of whom that he might be the water among many water any question the firstborn among many brethren hallelujah therefore peter said you also as lively stone i'll build up a spiritual house a holy prison to offer up spiritual sacrifice acceptable to god by jesus christ but you're a chosen water a royal water a holy water a peculiar water that you should show forth the presence of him that has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light everybody here which in tampa were not a people the gentile but are now the people of god and the melchizedek which have now or not obtained mercy at the beginning but now we have obtained water under the mercury priesthood dearly beloved i beseech you as strangers like abraham and pilgrim like abraham abstain from water which war against the water because your soul has been redeemed the black dog is in your flesh now be careful of the black dog because your soul is with him that's what paul is saying now paul uh brother branham say have made us priests did you ever know what a priest is what his office is a priest is to make sacrifice to make intersection and over in hebrew it says that we the church is a royal priesthood a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people a holy nation peculiar people royal priesthood offering here it is now offering spiritual sacrifice every man and woman that comes to god enter into the water we all become priests let me look at the time amen we good ever here in hebrew 5 verse 1 the bible say for every high priest taken among men is ordained for man in things pertaining to god evacuate that he may offer both gifts and sacrifice for sin when they pull a high priest like aaron god is giving him the office of a priesthood and the reason why god is giving him the office of the priesthood is so that he can do the service to the other children of god remember here that's what paul is saying in plain language where are we going who can have compassion we okay now put a seat belt a high priest one of his characteristics he must have what amen we okay now levitical priesthood mercy said that priesthood under the levitical priesthood for you to be a high priest you must be a man that must have compassion oh my god everybody okay levitical priesthood everybody here and melchizedek prison because the law was a shadow it was a tap so when you see the law you can tell what is coming up when we see a high priest it's telling you there is a true high priest somewhere because what moses was doing was a copy so if the high priest were the human temple and and the bonnet jesus christ must wear the same thing but when you look at jesus christ you don't see it naturally the high priest have to display them naturally jesus have them spiritually amen here hallelujah i'm preparing you for the oncoming sermon down the road here so levitical priesthood if a man is a high priest this man must have compassion so if you are born under liver you are born on the aeron and you are harsh they cannot put you to the high priest because when you get there you're going to get the machine gun and shoot the entire church everybody here because the people that approaches david are in distress we okay now are we blending things together the people that come to david have debt so if they put you there and all you want in the office is everybody to have 800 point in their credit score nobody can come to the office because it's fear it's judgment all the time when we come he's looking at you by the credit score when he sees you what is your credit 500 bad boy out what is your credit 600 bad boy out what is your credit 800 good boy you have been doing the good stuff sit down here that's not the high priest hey barker because brother said might have 500 in his credit score but how did he get 500 did he really wasted or did the circumstances of life happen to him and he lost his job or maybe he got sick in the hospital and because of sickness he lost his job and he could not afford to pay his car and that's why he has a bad credit or maybe he lost his wife and he went through a depression and because of depression he lost everything but if you calibrate him by this call you're going to put him out not understanding that he was an honest man anybody okay are we okay now a high priest who have compassion under who i thought compassion is from said the people that really know to qualify for it now for high priest you must have compassion on an ignorant somebody who doesn't know somebody who didn't know better anybody here somebody who grew up in a ghetto somebody who grew up in the street he grew up with a mother that was changing boyfriend like clothing that's all he saw he never been in church [Music] every day they're cussing in the house from the morning to the evening everybody's cussing and when you see him he's displaying where he grew up his language is bad he cannot speak without cussing a high priest must be able to reach to that person and to to test that person and to pull him out do you understand do you understand because according to the law if a priest have a uh what do you call it like a club foot or he have an infirmity he's disqualified he cannot be a priest they gotta check you up perfect credit score curriculum vitae never violated never have a ticket never have a problem with a police officer qualify that's the law anybody here and those people when jesus christ came and look at those perfect people he said you race of vipers that's john the baptist how can you say race of vapors to the people that are perfect in the law paul from the tribe of benjamin from this this this pharisee of the pharisee everything perfect and then look they say paul say i was a cheap sinner everybody here when jesus came he looked at them he said you who devoured the widow i thought he was the publican that devoured the widow are we okay [Laughter] where is my clicker hallelujah a high priest who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way [Music] i came not to seek the healthy people amen you remember reading i came to seek the sick one because i am a doctor i am a physician for me to display my talent somebody must be sick if somebody is sick then i can treat him and then my reputation can go that there is a good doctor somewhere else the reputation of a doctor goes by the cases a doctor you bring a sick man he brings you a healthy man you bring a sick man he bring you a healthy man they say that's a good doctor that's what makes my reputation amen but if all i have is yearly checkup good cholesterol good cholesterol good out everybody can do that every care so for the ignorant and for the one that is out of the way this samaritan had compassion amen is he really a samaritan is he really a samaritan amen who can have compassion on their ignorant and on them that are out of the way for he for that he himself also is compassed with water in other words the high priest must be human amen we cannot have a high priest in the old testament that is an angel amen because an angel they don't feel what we feel but here they can appear and disappear i cannot disappear until the rapture comes everybody but the high priest must be 100 percent human amen amen anybody here so that when a human being approach him he can understand you from which standpoint you're coming from but here when you say i'm sick the high priest understands you when you say to the angel i am sick the angel doesn't know what you're talking about amen hallelujah where are we going brother stephen verse 3 and by reason here of he this is the old testament as for the people so also for himself the water so when the high priest was going into the temple for the atonement of the entire nation because the high priest was taking the sin of everybody everybody give me my time what the high priest was doing he come here and collect what did you do wrong five you 20 you 15 you he correctly collected he have a big bag like this and when he carried that it's the sin of the people everybody so when he's approaching god he doesn't approach god like he is good they are the bad one amen i'm taking time here he's approaching god like me and them we messed up as much as i am pleading for them before even i plead for them i must plead for myself because i have done the same thing that they are doing amen so number one the high priest have to offer the lamb for himself here he's seeking mercy for himself then he goes and pick up the congregation and bring mercy and kill the second lamb for the congregation amen and levitical pursuit the law was a shadow of things to come what happened under melchizedek are we okay amen the bible say verse 7 for such a high priest becomes us in other words is feeding for us everybody who is water and water and water separated from water and the melchizedek our high priest is holy our high priest is separated from sinner he cannot sin who can convince me of sin there is no way our high priest can sin when he comes he was god in human flesh god cannot sin [Music] but paul is saying we need a priest that is god it's a good one he said our priest is harmless he's undefiled he's pure he's separated from sinner and made higher than heaven who need not daily as those high priests to offer up sacrifice first for his own sin and then for the people for this he did was when he offered up water in the old testament under the levitical priesthood the high priest himself offered sin for himself then for the people but under melchizedek the one who came doesn't have sin amen what did god do anybody care number one god became human amen everybody in the man called jesus christ ever here and jesus was the name of god america but the problem with jesus jesus was 100 percent human and 100 percent god do you follow me i hope we on the algebra right he must be good because only god can pay the penalty of god ever here he must be human because he must understand us the way we are ever here ever here that's why when they brought him before the tomb of lazarus he expressed both sides ever here before he resurrected lazarus he first cried just like you crying [Applause] ever here ever here he came first an express human being jesus never went to lazarus and got there and said lazarus comes off we cannot do that all we're gonna do is wow look at his power wow he have some kind of power i don't have that one i cannot do that that's not a high priest everybody jesus when he came he first began to act like you amen when he looked he wasn't yes just like you just like you in other words i understand you i know the pain that you have i understand you're suffering i understand your loss i am i am separatizing with you amen i am not here to act like i am insensible of your trouble i am not here to show you that i don't have feelings i do have feelings i understand you after he finished crying then he said seed of abraham we are not only human being but we are also god when the situation comes don't be only crying after you cry shake yourself remember you are god rise above your situation look at the problem change the gear from human gear into god's gift when you put that gift you say take off the stone lazarus [Applause] [Music] you want to go home hallelujah hallelujah in other words i understand your situation and i was in your place it is normal for you when it hits you to cry that's normal i understand that but don't link your day that's not the end remember who you are remember you are just like me let demand that was in me be also in you remember before situation [Applause] do you believe god knows everything when the disciple were to trouble in the boat do you think jesus didn't know he was sleeping do you think he didn't know he let them do what they can do but here then they went do this let's go borrow money here this this it doesn't work let me add this one get a kosana try everything and he's still sleeping he's still sleeping he was aware of everything that was going on when you got tired and somebody said where is it he's sleeping in the boat and brother branham preached the message go awake that jesus is in you he sits just like this [Applause] and he let you handle your problem the way you want to handle it [Applause] everybody here until you get tired then when you wake him up he said that's what i was waiting for then he put his foot like this he said peace [Music] how much headache would have they saved themself how much headache that's the kind of high priest we need [Music] are we okay my god somebody's pulling very hard amen for their love make men high priests which have water they have weaknesses but the word of us which was since the law because he already existed maketh the son who is consecrated for water it's a different kind of high priest amen for he has made him to be water you okay jesus when he was going he was 100 men and 100 percent god meaning if they tempt you they were also tempting jesus you follow me when they tempt you you look and you fell for temptation you become guilty you follow me but jesus was not falling for temptation amen are you following me so jesus was guiltyless [Music] so when you approach jesus he can feel your temptation but he cannot become what you are amen do you follow me because he's still pure but here when you come you are guilty you don't want to look at his eyes back here because you were tempted and you fail and you consume the temptation and you're coming to him even when he's tempted he doesn't consume the temptation so he's still a little bit different than you ever care the guiltiness do you follow me the shame that you feel christ could not really feel it he can feel your temptation i'm going slowly i know i'm pushing different gears but it's going to help you okay but to be guilty like he did something bad jesus have not done because there was no sin in him amen amen let me read that again for he has made him water he was not seen they made him sin for us who knew what that we might be made the water in other words god look at jesus and say the way you are still like this you won't understand my children very good i have to do something do you follow me do you follow me because when they approach you the guilty you can sympathize but you don't feel their guiltiness everybody care amen so god god in jesus christ pull off do you follow me in gethsemane god came off i'm going slowly so the elementary you can get it god came out of jesus ever here he came out and he left jesus alone my father my father why have thou what what and then he took your sin you follow me he took your sin and he put it on jesus christ do you follow me now the feeling that jesus has is like he did it but he didn't do it you the one that did it he bore your guilt he bore your shame ever here he will help you love jesus more he will help you love jesus more are you in this audience this afternoon sinners god hates him but he loves them he loves you so much that he gave his only begotten son that he might drink the bitter cup for you remember he became water that human became water in other words god exchanged you and him he said you feel temptation but you don't feel the guilt let me make you feel the guilt of my children [Music] so when they're coming guilty after they have done something wrong you can also understand them in that standpoint amen hallelujah remember he became you that you might become him he became a sinner as separated from the water when he screamed my god why is that water he was separated from god in his death that you in your death might have god's water he became a child of water your sins not his own yours that you might become a child of water he took your place as a time creature that you might take his place as an eternal water and water amen hallelujah but with the precious blood of christ as they lab without water and without water who verily was for of them before the foundation of the world but was manifested in this last time for whom god say i'm gonna make you a good high priest you don't feel any temptation you must feel everything that they felt anybody here when they just coming from prostitution their guiltiness the feeling take that one put it on christ ever here so christ was loaded pretty good with your old sin amen uh i hope i'm talking to the seed of god amen the same jesus god is you were not even born do you follow me what you did today was already in christ [Music] all god was looking for is your representation and he look at everything you are done everybody here even what you gonna fail tomorrow [Music] amen he put everything and summarize in other words if you're gonna leave 45 or 10 or you're going to live 60 or 70 years god look at 70 years and look at every scene you're going to commit in 70 years and gather everything up and say this one is for brother greg this one is for brother kelly this one is for brother robert this one is for so the more jesus is saying you are here brother kelly here brother able here sister uh uh chair on here sister who is so the entire body is just completely filthy until when the heaven look the sun closed the eyes and the sun became dark too much too much a human being cannot be that bad even the fifth of the cross there whatever he did was there amen amen whatever abraham did what david did what jacob did all of them god gather up and put it in him because a high priest must understand the ignorant and those that are out of the way anybody here so when you are sinner jesus is just laughing because he already understood you when you are coming you're crying head over he doesn't surprise him he already understands it's surprising you because of spiritual amnesia you forgot that you were a child of god you were born in sin but he already knew that in 1940 something he's gonna come to the altar [Applause] hallelujah that's why he doesn't blame you let me continue you will get that lady everybody here so far what is compassion i'm over two minutes brother branham said he went into the temple we call him a mick man he was but many times we misunderstand what meekness is are we okay he was a man of compassion but yet we felt some time to understand what compassion is not human sympathy is not compassion but compassion is water relax relax you're gonna see who you are compassion is doing the will of god our compassion the way we understand compassion is different our compassion we want to even save judah [Music] did you get it did you get it our compassion for you to be really compassionate if you see judah take him to heaven that's not compassion compassion goes always with melchizedek here and back here compassion is doing the will of god listen what he's saying verily verily i say unto you the son can do whatever in himself but what he sees the water the father do there is the compassion come on knowing the water and what so compassion is not just doing the will of god compassion is first knowing the will of god and then doing it that's compassion hallelujah see the sun can do nothing in himself but what he sees not his what he sees the father doing that does the son likewise that's why in the pool of bethesda when he entered how many people were there multitude how many did he heal why if i ask you you're going to say that's bad he has the power why he didn't heal everybody melchizedek is different he's chasing the predestinated scene do you see how you special when he enter he has a commission he's entering he say where is he wake up out and that's it that's compassion our compassion is cmc presbyterian november everybody out and when you're bringing them out they go straight to the nightclub because you heal the sinner [Music] the bible say in hebrew 10 i'm going to search word to land wherefore when he cometh into the world jesus christ he said sacrifice and offering the word is not about here i desire mercy rather than water sacrifice and offering the word is known but a what the body of jesus christ that we just explained you god loaded with everything but a body has not prepared me everybody in burnt offering and sacrifice for what sin that has no pleasure he's erasing the law completely now anybody clear now he's going on the mercury then as then said uh i lo akam in the volume of the book it is written of me to do what that will oh compassion the body came to do the will of god he came for compassion and back here the body of christ came for compassion because of the names that were written in the book of life everybody here mark 14 36 and he said about father all things are possible and today take away this cup from me nevertheless not what are but what that what compassion he look he said if i ask him he's going to deliver me but when he look he say sister hadassah i cannot i cannot let her go i cannot help it go father not my will people are there i cannot let them go my will is all the father giving me our laws ever here when we talked about compassion we are looking at not human compassion but doing the will of god so the high priest ever care must know god will and must do it anybody here he must know god's will and he must execute the will of god back here that's compassion and number two he must also be compassionate to the ignorant let me get ignorant so we can stop everybody here when we talk about ignorance let me clarify compassion everybody compassion is doing the will of god the will of god is that every child of god that is predestinated and that was in the mind of god based on their origin before the foundation of the word jesus will lose none of them amen amen america so when god comes to you amen to save you it's actually him doing the will of god you will gather later when we talked about ignorance let me get here and then i'll let you go home and the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sin is how when he sinneth by ignorance before the lord to make an atonement for him and he shall be forgiven him so ignorance didn't start here he started in the old testament amen anybody care you shall have one love for him that sinneth through ignorance how many love you shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance but for him that is born among the children of israel and further that's a journey among water how many law one for the jews and for their in the old testament one law for ignorance anybody care no separation let me get here that you knew the word of god right they heard the law the gentile did not have the word of god how can a jew be ignored you see now you see what ignorance is but in acts 3 verse 14 but he denied the holy one and the chest and desire murderer to be granted unto you this is peter probably speaking he says they gave you barabbas and jesus you guys shouted for barabbas and you wanted to kill jesus christ he said and killed the prince of life whom god has raised from the dead whereof we are witnesses and now brethren i want that through water he did it as did also yo but those things which god before had showed by the mouth of all his prophet that christ should suffer he has so done what repent ye therefore and be converted that your sin through ignorance may be water blotted out when the time of refreshing shall come from the presence of who is showing that the jews knew the law but yet by knowing the law they killed the messiah and when peter looked he said you did it through ignorance a high priest must understand the ignorant one we okay amen i'm going to celebrate here probably and i thank christ jesus our lord who has enabled me for that he counted me faithful this is paul putting me into the ministry in other words after every damage that i caused to the church of the living god i have arrested them i whooped them i took them i put them to prison but something is blowing my mind what is blowing your mind paul what blows my mind is that after everything had done bad to his children he still comes and take me paul a bad man and he put me into the ministry how can he do that he takes the distress to go to david he take the beater soul to go to david he takes the public and the sinner those are the ones he's looking for paul said the way i am i am disqualified because i persecuted the church i have blaspheme i did everything that is bad i thought when i met him he's going to say not you ever hear but melchizedek doesn't look at that he knows that he was not you that did it everybody here when he looked at paul he said paul begin to say i'm sorry you know i persecuted the church you know uh when they were killing steven there i was there i consented paul said god said enough he said so you say enough i don't want you to talk anymore okay christ so what do you want so you're going to send me to hell he said i want you to preach the gospel [Music] me do you understand what you say me paul say yes you paul nobody else you you got peter not peter matter of fact when you come you're gonna be above all of [Music] them amen but they slept with you they were helping you i understand you the very very bad one you are the one i was looking for because paul you were a chosen [Music] do you know that in act 9 you were a chosen vessel ananias go pray for paul father you know that man that's a bad man he is arrested ananias calm down i know what i put in him that bad man go over there and go pray for him that's why before he even get the holy ghost ananias came he said brother saul the brother have not received the holy ghost yet but they gave ananias the revelation by melchizedek that before the foundation of the word you and him were playing over there and i said oh so he was my brother yes in eternity there you two were fellowshipping over there and then i asked him and then asked be careful he might have a gun brother he takes a high priest to make ananias understand that he take a high priest to make paul understand it and let me stop here we're going to pick up the bible say who was before a blasphemer and a persecutor and an injurious but i obtained what i desire what versus what but i obtained mercy because i did it in water i thought paul was trained under the feet of gamalia he knew the law left and right but still under unbelief i did it ignorantly and the grace of our lord was water and water with water and water which is in who this is a faithful water and worthy of all acceptation that christ jesus came into the world to save who of water if they give you the law are you going to choose paul [Music] are you going to choose paul are you going to entrust paul and matter of fact the grace that was in jesus christ jesus took it and handed to paul you remember we saw it and paul took that grace and begin to go with the jew and that you begin to reject the paul and you go to roman nine you will see paul grieving for the jew that i wish that meepo was cursed and the jews entering why paul became christ amen he is now accepting to be destroyed so that israel entered that's why moses said if you want to destroy them come and destroy me the high priest and the melchizedek because moses began to understand things differently and the people that wanted to stone moses moses say you want to kill them kill me and moses even tell god go in the book of life take my name off and god scratch his head he said moses you're right but when i'm saying no he was not moses he was melchizedek in moses let's stand up [Music] so today you understand the priesthood the people that follow david the people in trouble it's an anointing that comes to bring compassion to the ignorant and to those that are out of the way that's why jesus said i didn't come for sacrifice if i came for sacrifice i could be in the temple amen waiting for sacrifice i came for mercy i came to seek the sinner the republican those that are sick that's what i came for not the levitical priesthood that's why the samaritan when he's coming what the priest fell what the levat fell the good samaritan came in and fulfilled it who is this good samaritan who is it ah my god let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly tonight father once again thanking you for your mercy for your grace and for your love that you have lord display into christ the lord father the more we go deep into these things the more we can now see further the love that you have for us that father despite everything that we have done and sometimes we have acted foolishly sometimes we knew better and we did things wrong but still because of predestination father you have not let any of us go father when we didn't even understand the message when we didn't have even understood this revelation when lord father we had questioned puzzling our mind but there was a supernatural element that was still holding on to our lives lord father pulling us and we know that somebody is watching over us and that somebody is no other than the savior himself the creator of heaven and earth who is a husband who is a father who is a mother who is everything to us father as you continue to unfold yourself and display yourself in such a way lord the more we can see you in this light the more now we can live for you not by constrain or by a law or by a commandment but now we want to live for you out of love out of appreciation because how can we hurt somebody that gave so much for us how can we do something bad to a man that took a shame that took our guilt that took our pain that took our suffering even before we were born before we even sin that man took our sin upon him why do we want to disappoint such a man by going astray why do we want to do things bad further to make your heart against suffering because when you pull your prophet outside father you show him that every time he was sinning his sin was striking your face and blood was gushing out of you and you are still screaming and you say father forgive him lord and father many times we do things that are right that are not right things that are wrong things that we have been preached we have been taught in this church not to do and we still do it lord father and lord you are still there father lord jesus christ interceding and pleading lord father with blood gushing over your face and saying father forgive them they have not come to the understanding yet but lord may everybody turn their eyes father in this church and those that are streaming to look at that picture and to see what we have been doing all the time and then from there on we can learn not as a law not as feeling going to hell but further as a matter of love and appreciation to live for you and to do everything that we can by the power of the holy spirit father to please you lord lord we thank you lord father for unfolding these things lord we are committing your children unto the hand and those that are sick those that are struggling those that will be lord father traveling back lord the father may you protect them under the great wings of jehovah may you protect your children as they going home lord and may you continue to unfold your revelation more and more until an ankle will be grasping their soul and father don't never let them go until we meet you into the air lord father we humbly ask it and commit everything unto the hand in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you church we love you [Applause] amen amen when the seas are raging in the boat in the bible and the disciples were worried and they turned to the master and he said peace be still we know that same that same jesus and flesh is here with us and he's in our hearts so when the storm is raging in your life you can just just ask the lord to calm calm the storm whatever it may be in your life he's with us the same master that was in that boat is here with us in each one of us in our hearts [Music] sails on the troubled sea and ever there's a wind in myself oh but i have a friend who watches over me when the breeze turns into [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] and make the sun again [Music] [Music] and make the sun shine again [Music] oh sometimes my soul can be found [Music] it may bring me low oh and he can come [Music] you're dismissed this evening god bless you [Music] [Applause] shine again [Music]
