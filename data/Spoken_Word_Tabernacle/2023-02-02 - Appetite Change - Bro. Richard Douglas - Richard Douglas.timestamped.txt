[27:15] amen so invites his daddy to give us a
[27:18] testimony then by the Charles Hamilton
[27:20] amen
[27:25] so I just wanted to give this testimony
[27:27] for the glory of God
[27:28] um I'm going to be brief I just wanted
[27:30] to read the scripture Revelations 12 11
[27:32] it came to me just a moment ago and it
[27:34] says and they overcame
[27:36] him by the blood of the lamb and by the
[27:39] words of their testimony and they love
[27:40] not their lives unto death
[27:43] I just want to give glory to God because
[27:46] um on Friday
[27:48] um on Wednesday when we were leaving out
[27:51] um we got to Florida and
[27:54] um we got some food I believe we took
[27:57] some got some shrimp from a Jamaican
[27:59] place and I believe the shrimp wasn't
[28:02] well I didn't notice at the time and by
[28:06] the time I woke up the next morning to
[28:07] get on the flight to go to Jamaica I had
[28:09] a rash in my back I thought it was um
[28:11] maybe like fake jewelry poisoning or
[28:13] something like that so I took my jewelry
[28:14] off by the time I got to Jamaica the
[28:17] rash had gone all over my back and the
[28:19] next morning by the time I was there for
[28:22] a day my skin started to get irritated
[28:24] and then my rash came all the way up to
[28:25] my face
[28:26] um and it swole up and I wasn't sure
[28:28] what happened being in the third world
[28:30] country a lot of times you don't really
[28:31] want to go to a hospital in those places
[28:34] because they don't have the best care
[28:35] and I remembered the reason my main
[28:38] reason for giving this testimony is
[28:39] because I thought lightly of prayer at
[28:42] that moment I wasn't looking to the Lord
[28:43] for help I was looking just for help and
[28:46] my mom simply just put her hands on me
[28:48] and spoke the word and within two days
[28:50] and I would say through the things of
[28:52] that God through God's creation he
[28:55] allowed natural healing to come to my
[28:56] body I went to the Mineral Springs in
[28:58] Jamaica and it's a place where the water
[29:01] is infused with all these minerals and
[29:03] within 30 minutes after leaving the bath
[29:05] my my swelling went down and my skin
[29:08] started to heal and I went back the next
[29:09] morning and it was completely gone so I
[29:11] just wanted to thank the Lord for that
[29:13] natural way and prayer for being
[29:15] combined to heal my body to come back
[29:17] with nothing to deal with and now I have
[29:20] nothing so I'm so grateful
[29:22] [Applause]
[29:27] and it's super charge after um the
[29:31] testimony if he can bring our prayer
[29:32] requests to the Lord amen amen I just
[29:35] want to give the testimony for the glory
[29:37] of God as well and
[29:38] I am on
[29:42] Tuesday Tuesday I believe it was I was
[29:45] on the job site and um
[29:47] the pump is really I operate a concrete
[29:50] pump and um
[29:52] I lost the remote I lost the remote
[29:55] because my Outriggers were falling in
[29:57] the ground and I almost I kind of
[29:58] panicked because I had to swing the boom
[29:59] around which is very heavy it would turn
[30:02] over hurt somebody probably kill
[30:03] somebody
[30:04] so I had to hurry up and get back around
[30:06] to get everything situated and I left
[30:10] the remote on a mixer truck
[30:13] and the mixer truck took off he gave me
[30:15] the grout and he took off
[30:17] and I said I I didn't know where it was
[30:19] at I'm looking around for it I'm like oh
[30:21] my God I was on the mixer truck so I'm
[30:24] in panic mode I'm calling I'm calling
[30:26] everybody say can somebody call them on
[30:27] the phone or something like that and I
[30:29] remember normally brother John is at
[30:31] work at that time on dispatch
[30:33] so I ran and got my phone I said brother
[30:36] John let it know I was waking him up I
[30:38] said brother John that that driver that
[30:40] was here can you call him to make sure
[30:43] he give me the uh the remote back so
[30:45] don't break or something and brother
[30:46] John said but I'm not at work I said
[30:49] Lord have mercy I said okay he said well
[30:51] brother what's wrong and I told him what
[30:52] was wrong he said okay brother he said
[30:54] I'll check I'm not in for another hour
[30:56] he said I'll come I'll call back and
[30:57] check on you so by that time I'm walking
[30:59] to the end of the road and I'm looking
[31:01] for it and I'm praying the other um
[31:03] gentlemen are looking for it as well and
[31:05] I'm like Lord Lord I don't know what to
[31:07] do I don't know what to do Lord I don't
[31:08] understand why this is happening now I
[31:10] said Lord I need your help I said I need
[31:12] your help Lord I don't know where this
[31:14] remote is at the remote is about fifteen
[31:16] thousand dollars just for the remote I
[31:18] said Lord I need this remote so I'm
[31:21] getting frustrated I'm getting upset I'm
[31:23] like I don't understand this now this is
[31:25] the second time that happened
[31:26] so I'm like Lord what is going on you're
[31:29] trying to tell me something here because
[31:30] I remember the Lord had brother Stephen
[31:32] say when the situation happened stop or
[31:35] you'll miss God
[31:37] I stopped
[31:39] and I said Lord you've been preaching to
[31:41] speak the word I said Lord I don't know
[31:43] what to say I said Lord but I need that
[31:45] remote back and by the time I lift my
[31:47] head up the driver was coming over
[31:49] saying hey he found it on the road
[31:52] and he came back but the driver came
[31:54] back with it it was Jimmy and he came
[31:57] back with it and he said well you just
[31:58] owed me breakfast
[32:00] but I but I thank the Lord for it
[32:02] because I was in panic mode but at that
[32:04] time brother John told me he said him
[32:06] and him and uh his wife was praying for
[32:08] me so it was it was a unified thing and
[32:10] I thank the Lord

[53:58] given him a commission here he's giving
[54:01] him one of his Commandments he commanded
[54:02] him saying of every tree of the garden
[54:06] thou must eat freely
[54:09] but of the tree
[54:11] knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt
[54:14] not eat of it for in the day you eat
[54:17] that
[54:18] in the in the day that thou eatst
[54:20] thereof
[54:22] Thou shalt surely die
[54:25] amen
[54:26] let us pray
[54:28] father
[54:29] God oh Jesus
[54:32] father we are humbled by your presence
[54:34] Lord
[54:35] father we realize Lord as your Apostle
[54:38] told us he said I ain't seating me quake
[54:42] in your presence
[54:44] father Lord is the reverence we have for
[54:47] you father it's the honor we have for
[54:49] you Lord is the the love we have for you
[54:53] Lord knowing that father without you we
[54:56] can do nothing Lord
[54:58] Father Here I am once again Lord and a
[55:02] place Lord no man can do any more Lord
[55:05] but oh God fathers you sent your
[55:08] disciples one day said go loose the coat
[55:13] tonight Lord God that you might be the
[55:17] rider of god father you said the master
[55:19] have need of him go loose him oh God I
[55:24] pray you'd lose your power here tonight
[55:25] God I pray you lose your mercy Lord
[55:29] loose your grace Lord father I pray
[55:31] you'd lose this father God that we might
[55:33] receive your ungrafted word Lord hear
[55:36] this this evening God and Lord that we
[55:38] may leave with this in our heart Lord
[55:40] did not our hearts burn within us as you
[55:43] spoke to us along the way oh God grant
[55:46] it to us Lord and we'll be so quick to
[55:48] give you all the praise honor and Glory
[55:50] before we ask it in the name of Jesus
[55:52] Christ the righteous one our savior amen
[55:55] and amen you may be seated
[55:57] amen I love this
[56:00] as we look at this we look at God and
[56:02] he's here he is he's telling them to go
[56:04] ahead and eat
[56:06] whatever you hungry you know whatever
[56:07] you desire here whatever you because see
[56:10] that there hadn't been no sin there'd
[56:13] been no no attachment to nothing but him
[56:15] and and we see that Satan and when he
[56:19] come he had to change he couldn't he
[56:21] couldn't take away the hunger they had
[56:24] because he can't take away your hunger
[56:26] but he can pervert your appetite
[56:29] amen and we see here that he told him he
[56:32] said you can eat anything you want here
[56:34] but of the tree of the knowledge of Good
[56:37] and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in
[56:39] the day that thou eatst therein Thou
[56:42] shalt surely die let's go to chapter
[56:45] three and start right here look Satan
[56:48] had to get into so he had to have an
[56:50] agent to work with
[56:52] Satan knew he could not work with Adam
[56:55] or Eve unless he had an agent to get
[56:57] into the to this to this way to in order
[57:01] to change man's desire to change man's
[57:05] appetite to change the way he looked at
[57:08] God to the way he approached God the way
[57:10] he he worshiped God and we see Satan's
[57:13] still using the same tactic says now the
[57:16] serpent was more subtle than any beast
[57:20] of the field which the Lord God hath
[57:22] made and he said unto the woman yea God
[57:25] hath God said You shall not eat of every
[57:29] tree of the garden and the woman said
[57:31] unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit
[57:34] of the Trees of the garden but of the
[57:36] fruit of the tree which is in the midst
[57:38] of the garden God has said You shall not
[57:41] eat of it neither shall you touch it
[57:43] least you die
[57:45] so he wanted her to see what her
[57:47] response was there's no telling how long
[57:49] he he worked on her no longer no telling
[57:52] how long he approached her either that's
[57:54] the way he is with me and you his first
[57:56] approach is not he's not his he's not he
[58:00] knows he's not going to weaken you with
[58:01] you with his first approach all he's
[58:03] wanting you to do is is to catch your
[58:06] attention just for a little bit and and
[58:08] get and cause you to stop your time and
[58:11] and to come in reason with him and and
[58:14] try to figure out what God wants to
[58:16] wants you to do and he see here he
[58:19] begins to preach to the woman he begins
[58:21] to tell her and then she then she gets
[58:24] anointed and she begins to preach back
[58:26] to him huh I see both of them was out of
[58:30] their position
[58:31] and both of them began to speak
[58:34] and but an amazing thing about it is
[58:36] that that when this was happening that
[58:39] the first thing you'll see that the
[58:40] appetite was beginning to change the way
[58:43] she looked at the word of God was no
[58:45] longer the same the way she looked at it
[58:47] first
[58:48] because all through the scriptures as we
[58:51] go through the first two chapters of
[58:52] Genesis it says the Lord God hath said
[58:55] the Lord God has said the Lord God but
[58:58] right here they started calling God
[59:01] and anything can be God
[59:04] see Satan knew that Satan knew that he
[59:07] knew I have to has to be very crafty I
[59:11] have to be very wise with her
[59:13] she's she's a creative being God has
[59:16] created her she's she's come right out
[59:18] of Adam so she's not going to be easy to
[59:21] deceive but seeing that she's the weaker
[59:24] vessel I'll have to work on her
[59:26] I'll have to work on her for a while
[59:30] and he began to tell it to him Sheen
[59:32] again instead of saying the Lord God she
[59:34] began saying God has said You shall not
[59:38] eat of it neither shall you touch it at
[59:41] least you die
[59:42] and the serpent said unto the woman you
[59:45] shall not surely die for God does know
[59:47] in the day that you eat thereof then
[59:50] your eyes shall be opened and you shall
[59:52] be as Gods knowing Good and Evil
[59:57] they had never had the appetite to want
[1:00:00] to understand between Good and Evil
[1:00:04] until the serpent had to inject this the
[1:00:07] prophet said it wasn't the act that was
[1:00:10] the thing it was what happened at first
[1:00:13] he he had to bring the ACT to the mind
[1:00:17] already took place in her mind
[1:00:22] in order for the action to come That's
[1:00:24] what Satan knows about you for it to
[1:00:26] happen Brother Sam it has to start here
[1:00:28] first
[1:00:30] Satan said I've got to sow here first
[1:00:32] I've got to change the appetite of her
[1:00:35] thinking I have to change the way she
[1:00:38] thinks
[1:00:39] I got to change the way she looks at God
[1:00:43] I got to change the way she speaks to
[1:00:46] God
[1:00:48] and she began to talk differently she
[1:00:50] began to act different and he was
[1:00:52] offering her something she already was
[1:00:55] because of Satan because the serpent had
[1:00:58] no power
[1:01:00] had no power
[1:01:02] he had no Authority
[1:01:05] but he was wanting her to trade hit
[1:01:07] their Authority for his knowledge
[1:01:11] hmm
[1:01:13] he wanted he wanted them to step down
[1:01:16] into a lower position
[1:01:18] because when you're in this in that
[1:01:20] position Satan is powerless
[1:01:24] so Satan wants us to step back and get
[1:01:29] out of our position that's why the
[1:01:31] prophet of God come to tell us when you
[1:01:33] get in your position and recognize Who
[1:01:36] You Are
[1:01:37] oh glory be to God
[1:01:39] then Satan becomes powerless
[1:01:42] [Applause]
[1:01:42] [Music]
[1:01:44] but as long as he changed the appetite
[1:01:49] when he changed their approach brothers
[1:01:52] and sisters see how crafty Satan is see
[1:01:56] how dangerous it is with the ministry
[1:01:58] brother John a man that's all he has to
[1:02:01] do is just change one word
[1:02:03] then if you listen
[1:02:05] and you react
[1:02:07] and you eat
[1:02:09] then you respond
[1:02:12] then you become
[1:02:14] another being
[1:02:15] [Music]
[1:02:16] you're taking lower position because
[1:02:19] you've took the oh my goodness you've
[1:02:22] took it the appetite of another
[1:02:25] oh glory be to God
[1:02:27] glory be to God
[1:02:29] said you'll be gods
[1:02:31] now already was God's they didn't need
[1:02:34] to be opened they was already opened
[1:02:37] they were spotless they was blameless
[1:02:40] they were sinless whatever possessed
[1:02:43] where we're at right now through the
[1:02:45] blood of Jesus Christ
[1:02:50] glory be to God
[1:02:53] well I love the prophet of God said the
[1:02:55] number six is the number of man
[1:02:58] it just didn't happen in verse 6 for a
[1:03:02] reason
[1:03:03] it showed that they had lost their
[1:03:04] position
[1:03:06] they had lost their position they
[1:03:09] started catering to the flesh then
[1:03:12] no longer responding to the spirit of
[1:03:15] God the the hunger in their heart had
[1:03:18] changed
[1:03:19] oh glory be to God
[1:03:22] listen what he says what she says here
[1:03:24] and when the woman saw
[1:03:27] when she saw
[1:03:30] that the tree was good for food
[1:03:32] and was pleasant to the eyes and a tree
[1:03:36] to be desired to make one wise
[1:03:40] she took of the fruit thereof and did
[1:03:42] eat and gave also unto her husband with
[1:03:46] her and he didn't eat
[1:03:48] and the eyes of both of them were opened
[1:03:52] and they knew that they were naked
[1:03:55] and they sowed fig leaves
[1:03:58] together and made themselves aprons
[1:04:02] see what happened
[1:04:04] they didn't need a covering then
[1:04:08] because they was under that Holy Veil
[1:04:11] not on her lust Veil as long as they was
[1:04:15] on that Holy vehicle they didn't look at
[1:04:17] each other like that
[1:04:19] but when this happened they began to
[1:04:21] look at one another like that they begin
[1:04:23] to oh that's what happens we can tell
[1:04:25] what you're eating because the way you
[1:04:26] look at one another
[1:04:28] oh glory be to God
[1:04:31] oh my see that's why you could say that
[1:04:34] he says you're say you're rich and
[1:04:36] increased and goods and have needed
[1:04:38] nothing but I say to you you're
[1:04:41] miserable blind and naked and north at
[1:04:45] night
[1:04:46] right back to the same position in the
[1:04:50] wrong position
[1:04:51] oh glory be to God
[1:04:54] Hallelujah
[1:04:57] Oh What a Mighty God
[1:04:59] the first thing man does when he sins he
[1:05:03] has to cover up
[1:05:06] he has to cover up
[1:05:09] he looks for a covering
[1:05:11] he didn't need a covering until he
[1:05:14] sinned
[1:05:15] he didn't need the blood until he sinned
[1:05:18] he didn't need Mercy till he sinned
[1:05:21] he didn't need healing until he sinned
[1:05:25] when he changed her appetite
[1:05:28] she probably said her desire
[1:05:30] and change their desires to speed on
[1:05:33] this
[1:05:34] oh glory be to God look at us look over
[1:05:37] here first John chapter 2 verse 16.
[1:05:39] let's look at this he said for all that
[1:05:42] is in this world
[1:05:44] the lust of the eyes I mean the lust of
[1:05:48] the flesh
[1:05:49] the lust of the eyes and the pride of
[1:05:52] life
[1:05:53] is not of the father so what she took
[1:05:57] was not of the father
[1:05:59] [Music]
[1:06:01] so her appetite had changed from feeding
[1:06:03] on the word of God
[1:06:06] to satisfying the desires of the flesh
[1:06:10] oh glory be to God I'm glad the prophet
[1:06:13] told us taught us this he said he said
[1:06:16] you want to know where a man stands he
[1:06:19] said you'll give him the word test
[1:06:20] [Applause]
[1:06:23] you tell me you believe this message and
[1:06:25] you reject it
[1:06:27] you say you believe the word of God and
[1:06:28] you reject it
[1:06:30] you say what the Bible says to him and
[1:06:32] you tell them and they reject it and you
[1:06:34] tell me you're a son and daughter of God
[1:06:36] no your appetite's wrong
[1:06:40] we cannot just take one quote from here
[1:06:42] one scripture from there and make it
[1:06:45] satisfy that's what it is they want
[1:06:47] satisfaction
[1:06:50] we need Redemption
[1:06:52] we need the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:06:58] we need Deliverance
[1:07:03] he said it's not of the world
[1:07:05] but look at this or what she how she
[1:07:07] does it look I'm it's wonderful how the
[1:07:09] scriptures are so beautiful how they tie
[1:07:11] together and he here it goes we know
[1:07:14] Genesis is the sea chapter
[1:07:16] where everything was planted and John's
[1:07:19] here's telling him it's coming up
[1:07:21] let's come up now
[1:07:23] and I'm telling you these things are not
[1:07:25] of God
[1:07:27] I'm telling you that that the lust of
[1:07:29] the flesh is not of God
[1:07:32] what does desire desire to be popular
[1:07:35] desire to be recognized
[1:07:38] desires to have a position That's what
[1:07:41] Satan wanted
[1:07:43] and only the way he could take his
[1:07:44] position because he'd already been cast
[1:07:47] down was they had to step back
[1:07:50] they had to step back
[1:07:53] in order for him to get try to get in
[1:07:55] their position
[1:07:57] the only way Satan can get in your
[1:08:00] position is you have to step back
[1:08:03] and let him step down
[1:08:05] that's what he wants he wants you to
[1:08:07] take a side road
[1:08:09] he don't want you to stay in the highway
[1:08:13] he don't want you to stay in the middle
[1:08:14] of the road that's why we got so many
[1:08:15] people going off on this side and we've
[1:08:17] got so many going off on that side
[1:08:19] because they're failing to hear
[1:08:21] they hear the word of God
[1:08:26] Hallelujah
[1:08:30] she said the first thing she said that
[1:08:33] the tree was good for food
[1:08:34] the less of the flesh unless they're the
[1:08:37] fish
[1:08:38] he created a different hunger
[1:08:41] he knew he could not abolish that hunger
[1:08:43] for The Fellowship Of God so he had to
[1:08:46] change
[1:08:47] Oh my he had that Oh my he had to give
[1:08:50] her an appetite suppressant
[1:08:56] Satan is a very shrewd man but he has to
[1:08:59] give you a suppressant
[1:09:01] you know what a suppressant is is
[1:09:04] something that satisfies you that ain't
[1:09:06] real
[1:09:11] that's why we see the natural world is
[1:09:14] always after diets things and they won't
[1:09:16] suppressants
[1:09:18] what the suppressant is you must just
[1:09:20] suppress the desire to want to feed the
[1:09:24] flesh
[1:09:25] same way in the natural as it is in the
[1:09:27] spiritual you have to you have to
[1:09:30] control the desire of it you don't need
[1:09:32] to suppress it you need an impression of
[1:09:36] the Holy Ghost
[1:09:37] [Applause]
[1:09:40] glory be to God
[1:09:43] he said
[1:09:44] listen this
[1:09:46] then here comes the Lusty eyes
[1:09:48] it says
[1:09:49] and that it was pleasant to the eyes
[1:09:53] Satan said I got her looking
[1:09:55] I got her feeding I got her wanting
[1:09:57] something else besides the voice of God
[1:10:02] oh Hallelujah he said I'm gonna I'm
[1:10:06] gonna suppress
[1:10:09] that's why you come to a lot in a lot of
[1:10:11] churches and the people are so
[1:10:13] damn priced and cold and formal
[1:10:20] because they're not doing what the word
[1:10:22] of God's saying
[1:10:23] he said take the book John and eat
[1:10:28] eat the book John it's the book John
[1:10:34] says well I give them a little religion
[1:10:37] make them feel good we're not here to
[1:10:41] feel good
[1:10:42] we're here to we're here that God might
[1:10:44] change us to good
[1:10:47] Governor said every time we come to
[1:10:49] church we have two choices we leave
[1:10:52] better or we leave worse it's according
[1:10:55] to what your appetite is when you come
[1:10:57] in if you're looking at your watch
[1:10:59] saying well you know the time is running
[1:11:01] out I'm hungry you're feeding the flesh
[1:11:05] come on now he said Revelation
[1:11:09] ought to be more to you than meat and
[1:11:12] bread on your table
[1:11:14] [Music]
[1:11:17] I feel like shouting glory be the god
[1:11:22] the supernatural power of God to
[1:11:26] transform
[1:11:29] glory be to God she said it's the luster
[1:11:32] yeah oh it looked
[1:11:34] look what she said that it was pleasant
[1:11:36] to the eyes
[1:11:38] and look at this the lust
[1:11:40] oh my the pride of life
[1:11:44] she said to make one
[1:11:51] I don't want your wives
[1:11:53] he wants you humble
[1:11:56] hey he said he hid it from the wise
[1:12:00] and the prudent
[1:12:02] and revealed it to beige such it would
[1:12:05] eat
[1:12:09] oh glory be to God
[1:12:11] the first thing they did was they said
[1:12:12] we're still Christians
[1:12:15] but we need a religion
[1:12:18] we need to approach we need to cover up
[1:12:22] no they needed the cleaning up
[1:12:25] they need a cleaning up
[1:12:28] I see that so much they say well I'll
[1:12:30] just sweep it on the rug but the rug
[1:12:32] still got dirt
[1:12:34] it's just dirt under the rug but that's
[1:12:37] worth it that's where the inspection
[1:12:39] comes that's why the Holy Ghost come
[1:12:42] he said he was a discerner of the
[1:12:45] thoughts in the intend the heart he dug
[1:12:47] down under the rug
[1:12:50] he said you look nice on the outside but
[1:12:52] on the inside he said you speak well of
[1:12:55] me with your mouth
[1:12:56] but your heart far from me
[1:13:00] I've seen many speak well of this
[1:13:03] message but their heart was far from it
[1:13:05] [Applause]
[1:13:08] it's the desire
[1:13:10] you're just a hunger it's the appetite
[1:13:14] he said blessed are they who hunger and
[1:13:17] thirst for righteousness they shall be
[1:13:21] filled
[1:13:23] foreign
[1:13:24] you got to come back to that
[1:13:27] forget about your Earthly needs
[1:13:31] that's why the scripture said I pray
[1:13:33] that you prosper and be in good health
[1:13:35] as your soul
[1:13:38] prospers
[1:13:39] for the Bible said the soul that sinneth
[1:13:42] shall surely die
[1:13:47] glory be to God
[1:13:51] to make one wise
[1:13:54] wow that's what's setting you that's
[1:13:56] what he used on her
[1:13:57] she wanted to be like the serpent more
[1:14:01] septum
[1:14:03] take my position he said
[1:14:05] then I'll take yours
[1:14:07] oh see when you take your position
[1:14:09] against the word then you take Satan's
[1:14:13] position
[1:14:15] and then you become a powerless dead
[1:14:18] Church
[1:14:25] and look
[1:14:27] when their eyes opened it didn't bring
[1:14:28] them to repentance
[1:14:31] because they'd done took a lust of hell
[1:14:33] right they said when their eyes open
[1:14:35] they sew together thickly
[1:14:38] I like what people say oh they ate an
[1:14:40] apple then why didn't they put leaves
[1:14:42] over their mouths
[1:14:50] why didn't he
[1:14:52] ain't your glad God sent us a prophet
[1:14:55] I like what Birdman says he said if it
[1:14:56] was Apples let's pass out the apples
[1:14:58] it's the Holy Ghost
[1:15:00] that opens the eyes to the unbeliever
[1:15:03] it's the holy ghost that brings all
[1:15:06] things to us he said behold I'll sin
[1:15:09] unto you a god
[1:15:12] what did we receive in this earth a god
[1:15:16] sent us a son of man to reveal these son
[1:15:19] of man to restore us back to the
[1:15:22] appetite of the fathers
[1:15:26] not the appetite of a denomination but
[1:15:30] the appetite for God
[1:15:32] down
[1:15:35] see when David said my soul thirsteth
[1:15:40] after thee Oh Lord
[1:15:43] for a living God
[1:15:46] see
[1:15:48] Satan wants to worship a dead God
[1:15:51] look what happened in Rome's Romans 1
[1:15:54] . that's what happened their appetite
[1:15:55] was changed
[1:15:57] he said they worshiped the creation more
[1:16:00] than the Creator that's what Adam and
[1:16:02] Eve did
[1:16:04] they worshiped The Serpent and didn't
[1:16:06] even know it why because they took his
[1:16:08] word over God's word
[1:16:12] shows you where you're at
[1:16:16] right oh I like the old saying you are
[1:16:18] what you eat
[1:16:21] I can tell if you eat your word because
[1:16:24] you received the word
[1:16:27] and that is a paradox in this age when
[1:16:30] the Bible tells me and you there'd be a
[1:16:32] hunger
[1:16:34] for the hearing
[1:16:36] not that it wouldn't be preached but
[1:16:38] when they reject it their ear is bored
[1:16:40] and they can no longer hear
[1:16:43] so they no longer hunger they're
[1:16:46] hungering for something but it's not God
[1:16:53] because when the word of God comes it
[1:16:56] sets you free he says you shall know the
[1:16:58] truth and the truth shall make you free
[1:17:04] and he said who the son is set free is
[1:17:07] friend dead
[1:17:10] but Satan wants to suppress that do you
[1:17:13] know within yourself
[1:17:14] there's three kind of believers
[1:17:17] no you know the prophet preached in an
[1:17:19] audience but right here
[1:17:22] body
[1:17:23] Spirit soul
[1:17:25] that's why you got to have the
[1:17:27] born-again experience because these two
[1:17:29] other Albert courts are ruling
[1:17:33] if there's not a king on the inside
[1:17:36] there's a devil on the outside
[1:17:39] come on now
[1:17:40] [Music]
[1:17:42] we're not here to have a form of
[1:17:44] godliness
[1:17:45] That's what Satan wants you to have
[1:17:48] he said they had a form of godliness but
[1:17:50] denied the power thereof to be changed
[1:17:57] he said don't be conformed to this world
[1:17:59] but be he transformed by the renewing of
[1:18:03] your man
[1:18:06] [Music]
[1:18:08] for as a man thinketh in his heart so
[1:18:11] easy
[1:18:12] [Music]
[1:18:12] [Applause]
[1:18:15] glory be to God
[1:18:17] this man is the
[1:18:19] you've heard
[1:18:22] nobody says you cannot convert him
[1:18:25] until immortality takes over
[1:18:30] because of the Fall the old glory be to
[1:18:32] go because of the Fall they bypassed
[1:18:35] immortality to take on mortality
[1:18:39] they bypass Incorruptible to take on
[1:18:43] corruptable
[1:18:44] that's why God said I got one on you
[1:18:47] Satan I got one on you I Gotta See
[1:18:51] I have a c
[1:18:53] and that seed will hunger for my word
[1:19:02] [Music]
[1:19:05] glory be to God
[1:19:07] we see that we see the scriptures being
[1:19:10] fulfilled right here in verse eight
[1:19:13] after their eyes were open
[1:19:16] they still heard the same voice
[1:19:20] huh
[1:19:21] he says and they heard the voice of the
[1:19:24] Lord God the Lord God
[1:19:27] not God the Lord God
[1:19:31] Walking In The Garden in the cool of the
[1:19:34] day
[1:19:35] and Adam and Eve
[1:19:37] hid themselves from the presence of The
[1:19:41] Voice
[1:19:43] oh
[1:19:47] glory be to God
[1:19:50] the Bible says the spirit and the bride
[1:19:54] said come
[1:19:56] the same voice walking in the garden is
[1:20:00] in the bride now
[1:20:02] that's what the Prophet come to do is
[1:20:04] say tell us that the voice is not only
[1:20:06] in me it's in you that's why Paul said
[1:20:09] get your eyes off Paul it's Christ in
[1:20:13] you the hope of glory
[1:20:16] [Applause]
[1:20:17] glory be to God
[1:20:20] hid themselves from the presence
[1:20:22] hmm that's why people don't want to see
[1:20:24] the spirit of God moving this church
[1:20:26] because they got sin
[1:20:29] hides
[1:20:32] the preacher's preaching let me let me
[1:20:35] put my head down
[1:20:36] let me let me look like I'm reading
[1:20:44] see he's got your eyes focused on
[1:20:45] something besides what God is saying
[1:20:48] it's not the man I'm just a donkey it's
[1:20:52] the rider on the donkey that's speaking
[1:20:55] through the Donkey
[1:20:58] it wasn't the power of the donkey that
[1:21:01] rebuked Balaam it was the power of God
[1:21:03] that spoke to the donkey to forbid the
[1:21:06] madness
[1:21:12] it's amazing how man was called for 120
[1:21:16] years and it still wouldn't come and the
[1:21:19] Animals was called one time and they
[1:21:21] started lining up
[1:21:24] caused their aperture their appetite
[1:21:27] never changed for the voice of God
[1:21:32] thank you
[1:21:38] that's why brother Bram said a man
[1:21:39] without the holy spirit is nothing more
[1:21:41] than a brute Beast
[1:21:43] what was what was the serpent he was a
[1:21:46] brute Beast
[1:21:47] he was knowledgeable but he was a brute
[1:21:50] Beast
[1:21:52] and he wanted them to want got them to
[1:21:55] where they wanted to eat like he eat
[1:21:57] he eat from his own desires
[1:22:01] not from the word of God
[1:22:04] that's where it shows where we're at
[1:22:06] what you're eating home brother now say
[1:22:08] do you want you want me to know where
[1:22:09] I'll know where a man is living bring me
[1:22:13] to his house brother John let me sit
[1:22:15] down in this table let me look at the
[1:22:17] books about his reading
[1:22:19] why can't we say this look at the thong
[1:22:22] let's go back and scan the phones
[1:22:26] he's pulling over on you again huh
[1:22:31] he's pulling one over on you again he
[1:22:34] said I'll give him a cell phone
[1:22:37] I'll give them contact to the Book of
[1:22:40] Knowledge
[1:22:42] and they'll eat that more than they'll
[1:22:44] eat with me
[1:22:48] he said I'll still have fooled them I
[1:22:51] have changed their appetite
[1:22:55] I have given them ever learning and
[1:22:58] never coming to the knowledge of the
[1:23:00] truth
[1:23:03] but brother Stephen I know everything
[1:23:06] now I know what how it is to that a
[1:23:09] tadpole has formed into a frog
[1:23:12] you know more about the life of a frog
[1:23:14] than you do about the life of God
[1:23:18] huh what do we want to know about what
[1:23:21] did the prophet said he said you want to
[1:23:22] get closer to God he said read your
[1:23:25] Bible and pray read your Bible and pray
[1:23:28] read your Bible and pray
[1:23:29] [Applause]
[1:23:37] oh but that's too simple
[1:23:40] too simple huh
[1:23:42] what do you want you want you want to
[1:23:45] show your intelligence
[1:23:47] there it is
[1:23:48] oh you want to show how magnificent you
[1:23:51] can speak
[1:23:52] before Paul shut that down if anybody
[1:23:55] could have come with words of wisdom and
[1:23:58] all those things because he was eaten
[1:23:59] off the tree of knowledge and thought he
[1:24:01] was eating off the tree of God
[1:24:03] because he was listening to the wrong
[1:24:05] voices
[1:24:07] It produced the wrong nature
[1:24:11] it made him want to persecute
[1:24:13] the church
[1:24:15] to death
[1:24:20] glory be to go
[1:24:25] I would love that brother
[1:24:28] elect
[1:24:29] does never
[1:24:31] persecute
[1:24:34] if you run your brother down
[1:24:36] if you belittle your sister if you talk
[1:24:39] about him you're not eating off the tree
[1:24:42] of life
[1:24:43] [Applause]
[1:24:45] that shows me you have no prayer life
[1:24:48] because the prophet told us brother that
[1:24:50] when you get in that presence you can't
[1:24:52] talk about anybody
[1:24:53] all you can do is say how dirty I am God
[1:24:57] help me in my condition and help my
[1:24:59] brother help my sister
[1:25:02] [Applause]
[1:25:02] [Music]
[1:25:10] notice they hid themselves
[1:25:14] do you know that's when man first
[1:25:16] started lying
[1:25:18] that's when life of knowledge of Good
[1:25:21] and Evil drunk lies
[1:25:24] and the Bible said a liar will have his
[1:25:26] part in the Lake of Fire
[1:25:28] he said Satan was alive from the
[1:25:31] beginning and the truth's not in him
[1:25:36] why oh my why did they hide
[1:25:40] and then tell a lie why the head
[1:25:45] and the Lord called unto Adam and he
[1:25:49] said unto him where art thou
[1:25:52] and he said I heard thy voice in the
[1:25:54] garden he never hid before
[1:25:57] they never hit before
[1:25:59] a change of appetite
[1:26:01] now they they used to walk with him hand
[1:26:06] in hand
[1:26:07] let's go let's go father let's walk hold
[1:26:11] your little children's hand you know why
[1:26:12] how I can tell when a man's walking a
[1:26:14] gun he's holding on to God's hand
[1:26:16] you know why you see so many people
[1:26:18] falling because they've let go of God's
[1:26:21] unchanging hand
[1:26:23] [Music]
[1:26:27] oh glory be to God hallelujah
[1:26:32] the appetite changed
[1:26:35] what did he they begin to make excuses
[1:26:39] and he said I heard thy voice in the
[1:26:40] garden and I was afraid
[1:26:44] first time man ever had fear on him
[1:26:47] Brother John
[1:26:51] this was not a reverence fear anymore
[1:26:54] this was a fear because they was wrong
[1:26:59] remember when the one man said in
[1:27:02] Martin's day in the prophet told us
[1:27:03] about I said I've got it I've got it
[1:27:07] I've got it he said there's a white robe
[1:27:09] that comes on me
[1:27:11] I'm the one that speaks the word of God
[1:27:13] he said then talk to Martin oh no no no
[1:27:15] no no no no no no no no no no no no no
[1:27:17] no why because Martin was the
[1:27:20] urethaneman to them
[1:27:22] guess what they made him go before him
[1:27:25] and the road vanished
[1:27:27] if it would have been of God it would
[1:27:29] have still been there
[1:27:30] see he was robed in his own
[1:27:32] righteousness
[1:27:33] and he was not robed into righteousness
[1:27:35] of God
[1:27:37] amen your own righteousness will not
[1:27:39] stand before God he will make you naked
[1:27:42] once again
[1:27:47] oh Hallelujah
[1:27:49] so I hit myself
[1:27:50] and he said who told thee thou was naked
[1:27:55] hast thou eaten of the tree where have I
[1:27:58] commanded thee that thou shouldest not
[1:28:00] heat he already knew what that was going
[1:28:01] to do when they ate it that's why he put
[1:28:03] out a word don't eat that one I'll give
[1:28:05] you everything right
[1:28:07] to eat them
[1:28:09] right this one here is probably the
[1:28:11] prettiest tree in the garden the tree of
[1:28:13] knowledge
[1:28:14] of good name it's just beautiful
[1:28:16] because he said it was one
[1:28:19] it was one to make one why
[1:28:22] it was one to make one desire it was one
[1:28:26] to make them hunger by the sand
[1:28:28] it was one that changed their appetite
[1:28:32] then their their attitude oh glory be to
[1:28:35] God their attitude when your appetite
[1:28:37] changes your attitude changes
[1:28:41] because your attitude determines your
[1:28:44] altitude
[1:28:46] we say we're up here we say we're up
[1:28:48] here but we're still on the runway
[1:28:52] we've got the vehicle but we can't crank
[1:28:55] it
[1:28:58] glory be to God
[1:29:00] he said and the man said
[1:29:03] the woman whom thou gavest me to be with
[1:29:06] me she gave me of the tree and I did
[1:29:12] we do the same thing we get caught when
[1:29:15] these little Johnny did it
[1:29:18] Fred made me do it Susie was doing that
[1:29:21] and I just followed her
[1:29:24] but I love the way James caught that he
[1:29:27] said you did that because of the lust
[1:29:29] of your flesh
[1:29:32] you can't say the devil made you do it
[1:29:34] it's because you yielded your flesh to
[1:29:37] his desire
[1:29:38] you fed your flesh that's why you got in
[1:29:42] trouble
[1:29:44] oh Hallelujah
[1:29:46] glory be to God
[1:29:50] listen to this
[1:29:51] and God and the Lord God he's trying to
[1:29:54] show him look this is where I want you
[1:29:56] to keep me I'm going to I want you to be
[1:29:58] but I said everybody wants you to be the
[1:30:00] healer
[1:30:01] the savior
[1:30:03] but very few wants him to be Lord
[1:30:06] you know what that means he's in control
[1:30:09] that's why so many people are out of
[1:30:11] control because they've not yielded to
[1:30:13] him to be controlled by
[1:30:17] oh my goodness what we needed to do is
[1:30:20] we needed to have our GPS reprogrammed
[1:30:25] Satan put our destination hail and Jesus
[1:30:29] said wait a minute
[1:30:31] all I'm going to ask him to do is push
[1:30:34] the button I agree
[1:30:36] see you never agreed to go where you was
[1:30:39] going you was tricked to go where you
[1:30:41] was going but God said if you agree what
[1:30:43] do you say he said
[1:30:44] total obedience to every word of God
[1:30:46] entitles you to the Holy Ghost
[1:30:49] please
[1:30:50] what's that degree means means ah
[1:30:55] he's trying to get him back to agree
[1:30:57] with him
[1:30:59] and then oh they could do this instead
[1:31:01] of agree and said Lord we made a major
[1:31:03] mistake
[1:31:04] a real Christian when he messes up he
[1:31:07] repents
[1:31:10] he don't hide it
[1:31:12] under a bushel he don't sweep it under a
[1:31:15] road
[1:31:18] he said let's clean it off
[1:31:21] let's get it all out let's be pure and
[1:31:22] holy before God you know why people
[1:31:24] don't see God anymore because he said
[1:31:27] blessed are the pure in heart for they
[1:31:29] shall see God
[1:31:30] you know why people didn't see God
[1:31:32] working through brother now because
[1:31:33] their heart was not pure
[1:31:40] glory be to God called
[1:31:44] then she said the serpent
[1:31:47] he gave up
[1:31:49] she didn't did he did he hold a gun on
[1:31:51] her you do this Eve I'm going to cut you
[1:31:54] I'm going to take this rope and I'm
[1:31:55] gonna choke you to death if you don't do
[1:31:56] this
[1:31:59] he had to change her appetite she
[1:32:01] desires it it's one to make one wise
[1:32:04] she wanted to have the ability that the
[1:32:07] serpent did
[1:32:09] subtle knowing all things but yet not
[1:32:12] knowing god
[1:32:17] glory be to God that's my brother I
[1:32:20] preached that message why we're so
[1:32:21] tossed about because this but it's
[1:32:23] unbeliever you'll never convert him he
[1:32:26] said he'll be a cuckoo bird
[1:32:27] Paul said he's a thorn in my flesh Paul
[1:32:30] said when I go to do good Evil's always
[1:32:32] present he was not talking about Silas
[1:32:34] he was talking about him
[1:32:37] this the flesh and see the spirit of man
[1:32:41] it works under conditions
[1:32:46] it's stormy today
[1:32:48] I don't know if I'm going to make it I
[1:32:50] don't know if I'm a Christian I don't
[1:32:52] know when the sun shines oh I got it I
[1:32:55] got it and the storm comes in the wind I
[1:32:57] don't know if I'm going to make it
[1:32:58] um
[1:33:00] but when you get it on the inside he
[1:33:02] says cast down all those senses
[1:33:07] cast down every imagination and bring
[1:33:09] every thought
[1:33:11] under the openness of Jesus Christ
[1:33:14] and let this mind
[1:33:16] that was in Christ be also in you
[1:33:20] I'm going to change your thinking so
[1:33:22] your attitude your appetite will change
[1:33:25] and with the attitude change your
[1:33:27] attitude changes
[1:33:29] he don't hate your brother no more
[1:33:33] hmm
[1:33:35] well the prophet said this is the way I
[1:33:36] love what brother Peter Paul said he
[1:33:38] said I couldn't tell my dad's enemies
[1:33:40] because he treated them the same as he
[1:33:42] did his friends
[1:33:47] help us help us Lord we need help
[1:33:51] we need help
[1:33:53] Jesus did that what did he tell Judas
[1:33:57] he said friend go do what you got to do
[1:34:00] he didn't say that yes there's that lie
[1:34:02] that's the one that's the devil he said
[1:34:05] go do what you got to do and do it
[1:34:06] quickly
[1:34:11] he said Judas thou betray us the son of
[1:34:14] man with a kiss
[1:34:20] be careful who you let kiss you
[1:34:29] glory be to God
[1:34:31] many have come up to the messaging
[1:34:36] but yet did betrayed the very life
[1:34:40] of the message
[1:34:42] saying yes I believe this message but I
[1:34:45] live so Unholy
[1:34:49] having a form of godliness and denying
[1:34:51] the power
[1:34:54] their appetite changed
[1:34:56] let's look over in in Matthew chapter
[1:34:58] six just for a minute amen I'm trying to
[1:35:01] go I'm trying I'm trying
[1:35:02] just be patient with Jesus
[1:35:06] Matthew 6.
[1:35:09] let's start at verse 26.
[1:35:13] and look at G
[1:35:15] trying to get across to them
[1:35:19] what is the main thing the main source
[1:35:22] he told him he said don't rejoice
[1:35:25] because the Devils is subject to you
[1:35:28] don't Rejoice because you've cast out
[1:35:31] devils
[1:35:33] don't Rejoice because you prayed for
[1:35:34] people and they've been healed he said
[1:35:36] but Rejoice because your name is in the
[1:35:38] books that means you're my seed see
[1:35:41] Jesus was talking and people was not
[1:35:43] listening because they didn't have the
[1:35:45] appetite for the voice of God
[1:35:48] they seen him as an illegitimate child a
[1:35:51] heretic a a vampire
[1:35:55] an illegitimate child but the seed seen
[1:35:58] him as God
[1:36:02] he tells them look Jesus said and
[1:36:05] answered him and said verily I say unto
[1:36:07] you you seek me not because you saw the
[1:36:10] Miracles but because you did eat
[1:36:13] of the Loaves and were filmed my
[1:36:16] goodness you know what brother Stephen A
[1:36:19] lot of people come to church and they
[1:36:20] just want their flesh son
[1:36:24] amen
[1:36:26] that shows what is the greatest appetite
[1:36:28] in your life
[1:36:30] preach me happy preacher
[1:36:34] Don't Preach on my life preacher don't
[1:36:37] walk in that room don't open the door of
[1:36:40] Pride preacher Holy Ghost don't go there
[1:36:43] make my flesh happy
[1:36:47] make me happy you know what makes me
[1:36:49] happy when God gets down in there
[1:36:53] and he sees the dirt
[1:36:55] in the corners and he begins to sweep it
[1:36:58] out
[1:36:59] [Applause]
[1:37:02] that's what's wrong we need a house
[1:37:04] cleaning
[1:37:06] and a soul feeling
[1:37:09] and a god revealing
[1:37:12] word
[1:37:17] but we're so full of Facebook and and
[1:37:20] and so full of our phones and we're
[1:37:22] looking at this and we're looking at
[1:37:24] that and then we wonder why we come to
[1:37:25] church and say oh brother Stephen preach
[1:37:28] me happy
[1:37:31] make me happy
[1:37:34] I say oh God lord if I'm not happy
[1:37:37] because of your word then God take me to
[1:37:40] the altar
[1:37:44] that I might be happy at your voice
[1:37:47] again
[1:37:51] he said labor not for the meat which
[1:37:54] perisheth but for the meat which
[1:37:56] endureth unto everlasting life which the
[1:37:58] son of man shall give unto you
[1:38:01] for him hath God the Father sin
[1:38:06] he's saying you need a ceiling
[1:38:08] you need a ceiling that's why you'll be
[1:38:11] able to understand the revealing
[1:38:15] that's why I told him he said
[1:38:17] he said Peter
[1:38:19] James
[1:38:20] somehow
[1:38:22] no more
[1:38:26] you need a Feeling
[1:38:28] you need an appetite desire they were
[1:38:30] saying oh lord lord who's going to be
[1:38:32] the greatest when you go will it be me
[1:38:34] John will it be James
[1:38:37] just not for me to give
[1:38:39] well we see that around the message
[1:38:40] everywhere who's the greatest preacher
[1:38:42] it's easy
[1:38:44] it's the Holy Ghost
[1:38:47] [Applause]
[1:38:55] Satan has deceived many by personalities
[1:39:00] they're looking at the personality of a
[1:39:03] man and failing to see the personality
[1:39:05] of the Holy Ghost he said if you don't
[1:39:08] believe me but believe the works I do
[1:39:10] but they are they that testify me
[1:39:13] search the scriptures for in the end you
[1:39:16] think you have eternal life and they are
[1:39:19] they that testify me
[1:39:24] appetite
[1:39:28] what you've been feeding on
[1:39:30] huh
[1:39:31] oh glory be to God
[1:39:34] he said heed it hungress and thirsteth
[1:39:37] for righteousness shall be filled
[1:39:41] they thought because look Jesus warned
[1:39:43] him he said don't be like this and then
[1:39:45] he explained it to him with great wisdom
[1:39:48] and if they wasn't able they wouldn't be
[1:39:50] able to catch it he said many will come
[1:39:52] to me in that day
[1:39:53] and cry Lord Lord
[1:39:56] did not we cast out devils in your name
[1:40:00] did not we heal the sick in thy name
[1:40:06] he said depart from me
[1:40:07] I never knew you you never received my
[1:40:11] word you never was born in my spirit you
[1:40:15] didn't have Oh Glory people get people
[1:40:17] get offended we've got so many doctrines
[1:40:21] around the message
[1:40:22] so many attitudes around the message one
[1:40:25] man says you don't you don't receive the
[1:40:27] seed till you go to the altar when the
[1:40:30] Bible said the seed he cannot sin for
[1:40:33] his seed remaineth in him
[1:40:35] the seed is what had to be quickened
[1:40:37] brother Bram told us non-seed cannot be
[1:40:40] quickened that's why when they go to the
[1:40:43] altar they get nothing they get her
[1:40:45] appeasement of their flesh they wake up
[1:40:48] and they get up and they have their own
[1:40:50] little rights
[1:40:54] look at me
[1:40:58] robed in embarrassment but not robed in
[1:41:01] humility
[1:41:02] instead of coming to him and said Lord
[1:41:04] we could have done nothing right
[1:41:07] except you would have done it to us
[1:41:09] father we are no more than the burning
[1:41:11] bush
[1:41:12] when your presence left the Bush was
[1:41:15] still a bush
[1:41:17] but when he was there it was Holy Ground
[1:41:23] Hallelujah
[1:41:25] glory be to God you love the Lord
[1:41:28] you love his word
[1:41:31] Pete John I mean
[1:41:33] Paul warns us in second Corinthians 11
[1:41:36] 3. he said but I fear
[1:41:39] right leashed by any means
[1:41:42] as the serpent he's taking it back to
[1:41:45] Genesis as the serpent
[1:41:47] the same serpent was there with Paul
[1:41:49] when he was there he was battling the
[1:41:51] church then
[1:41:54] he said that Antichrist spirit will come
[1:41:56] and already is working
[1:41:59] he'll be in full fruition right
[1:42:02] right he'll be in full maturity at one
[1:42:04] time
[1:42:05] that's why people can't hide stuff no
[1:42:07] more
[1:42:08] you know why
[1:42:09] because it's Harvest Time
[1:42:12] what did the son of man come to do to
[1:42:15] reveal
[1:42:16] thoughts and the intents of the home
[1:42:19] oh God
[1:42:20] he said at least by any means as the
[1:42:23] serpent beguiled Eve through his
[1:42:26] subtility your mind should be corrupted
[1:42:29] from the simplicity
[1:42:32] come on and I thought it was supposed to
[1:42:35] be wise I thought we're supposed to say
[1:42:37] things and people just like
[1:42:42] that's just too that's too simple
[1:42:43] brother Steve
[1:42:44] when you you bring it out so that's too
[1:42:47] simple you got to make it big or we can
[1:42:50] never get it
[1:42:52] it's like the horse chasing the carrot
[1:42:54] you never can't get it
[1:42:59] what we got to do is give the horse the
[1:43:01] carrot
[1:43:03] thank you
[1:43:04] that's what God does when you receive
[1:43:06] the Holy Ghost he rewards you to eat
[1:43:15] luring them away with deception that's
[1:43:18] Satan's greatest weapon is deception
[1:43:23] Paul said I don't come to you with
[1:43:25] enticing words of men and wisdom but I
[1:43:28] come to you in the power and the
[1:43:31] demonstration of the Holy Ghost
[1:43:34] I come to you to see to let you see a
[1:43:36] real living God
[1:43:39] that's why he said you'll be written
[1:43:41] Epistles
[1:43:43] red of all me
[1:43:46] you know why they they can say oh they
[1:43:48] want to about us but you know what they
[1:43:50] read Jesus
[1:43:51] when they really look
[1:43:57] Hallelujah
[1:43:58] that's just thankful for the grace of
[1:44:00] God
[1:44:03] oh my turn went to St John 6.
[1:44:06] just for a minute
[1:44:11] verse 35
[1:44:15] your attitude your appetite toward the
[1:44:17] word shows
[1:44:18] you know what we didn't come here
[1:44:21] for the for the song leader to work us
[1:44:24] up
[1:44:28] we didn't come here for the preacher to
[1:44:30] work us up
[1:44:31] we got to be like David he said I was
[1:44:34] glad when they said
[1:44:36] David said I was I'm already prepared
[1:44:38] for the house of God I've already been
[1:44:42] eating
[1:44:43] I've already been drinking
[1:44:45] maybe Jesus is going to come by my way
[1:44:48] and he's going to be thirsty and I'll
[1:44:50] have to give him some of my life some of
[1:44:53] some of the spirit back I may give him
[1:44:56] an offering of love and peace and joy
[1:44:59] and happiness
[1:45:01] instead of turning my back on him
[1:45:06] glory be to God
[1:45:09] he said then Jesus said unto them I am
[1:45:12] the bread of life
[1:45:14] he that cometh to me
[1:45:16] shall never hungry see right here he had
[1:45:19] to change their Hunter
[1:45:21] they was hungering for the desires of
[1:45:23] the flesh see the blood oh can I say it
[1:45:25] like this see the blood of bulls and
[1:45:27] goats could not take away this appetite
[1:45:32] it could cover it
[1:45:33] it could cover it but it could not
[1:45:35] remove it
[1:45:38] until the spirit of God comes
[1:45:41] I can tell if you receive the holy
[1:45:43] spirit because of your appetite
[1:45:47] he said he that coming to me shall never
[1:45:50] hunger oh I love the Lord but
[1:45:54] but what
[1:45:56] the what
[1:45:58] what he's not gonna take your cane
[1:46:01] offering
[1:46:02] by the fruits of your false praise in
[1:46:06] your false altar your flowery outward
[1:46:09] appearance
[1:46:10] Cain thought that would get him by he'll
[1:46:13] say look I just give him
[1:46:15] fruits and the vegetables and I'll give
[1:46:18] you this how it'll be so much more
[1:46:20] prettier than Abel's we know he'll love
[1:46:22] the beauty
[1:46:25] he said I don't want an altar of one to
[1:46:28] be desired I want a bloody lamb
[1:46:33] I need a blood
[1:46:38] oh Hallelujah that's why they had to
[1:46:39] take their hand and lay it upon the lamb
[1:46:43] giving all of their SI all of their sins
[1:46:47] and their iniquities and their
[1:46:49] transgressions upon him
[1:46:52] oh Hallelujah
[1:46:54] but it becomes so ritualistic to them
[1:46:58] God said I see they need me
[1:47:04] because they then no longer did they
[1:47:07] bring in Lamb that they had raised
[1:47:09] that they had fed brother Stephen
[1:47:12] they said we'll come
[1:47:14] and buy
[1:47:15] from the priests

[1:51:35] that say that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:51:36] yesterday today
[1:51:39] and forever
[1:51:41] he gave us a GPS that said I'm the Lord
[1:51:43] thy God here ye o Israel
[1:51:45] I'm the Lord thy God and I change not
[1:51:50] but you have to change him a little bit
[1:51:53] to draw the people
[1:51:57] now you know brother Stephen we have to
[1:51:59] cater to these young people
[1:52:02] we have to have certain programs that'll
[1:52:04] draw them that'll keep them in church
[1:52:15] let's give him a certain music
[1:52:20] a certain beat
[1:52:23] that makes their flesh Rejoice but yet
[1:52:26] they don't want the Holy Ghost
[1:52:28] [Music]
[1:52:30] [Applause]
[1:52:34] oh glory be to God
[1:52:38] but you know what I see when people
[1:52:39] desire the contemporary music and the
[1:52:42] things and that I see they've never had
[1:52:44] a nature change
[1:52:48] [Applause]
[1:52:52] let me tell you what Satan does he wants
[1:52:54] you to worship him under the umbrella of
[1:52:58] religion
[1:53:00] [Music]
[1:53:02] he wants you to feel it
[1:53:07] did you feel that
[1:53:09] it's not my feelings oh leave me I
[1:53:12] believe
[1:53:13] and when God does something to your
[1:53:14] heart
[1:53:15] hey when I used to get drunk I felt
[1:53:18] something
[1:53:20] I felt something
[1:53:22] I felt something when I partook of the
[1:53:24] wine when I took of the strong drink I
[1:53:27] felt something you know why guess what
[1:53:29] happened to them
[1:53:31] when they actually got to drink to
[1:53:33] change their nature and receive the Holy
[1:53:35] Ghost they thought they was drunk
[1:53:41] hey you know what Jesus didn't take my
[1:53:44] staggering out when the oil of the water
[1:53:47] when the when the when the oil when the
[1:53:49] wine of the word come I steal wobble
[1:53:52] when he comes
[1:53:57] it's not stimulating this it's
[1:53:59] stimulating this
[1:54:01] [Applause]
[1:54:05] he said we'll give him a modern music
[1:54:09] something that'll try
[1:54:11] you know we have to pay
[1:54:13] by thousands
[1:54:16] we must make a program
[1:54:19] for the people we must cater to them
[1:54:23] let's don't say everything God says
[1:54:25] anymore
[1:54:28] oh that kind of sounds like the the
[1:54:30] serpent doesn't it
[1:54:33] please
[1:54:34] come on that's why the Bible said try
[1:54:36] out the spirit
[1:54:38] and know whether it's of God or not
[1:54:40] then brother Brown said he seen the
[1:54:42] Prelude of the American bride
[1:54:44] she was being led by a witch to the beat
[1:54:47] of rock and roll twisting turning
[1:54:51] um
[1:54:53] the Holy Ghost knows how to present
[1:54:56] itself
[1:54:57] the Holy Ghost is a gentleman the Holy
[1:55:00] Ghost does not make us dance
[1:55:02] provocatively
[1:55:05] the Holy Ghost let's get there
[1:55:08] Hallelujah I feel the spirit of God to
[1:55:11] say this we're not here to entice our
[1:55:14] Lord
[1:55:15] we're not here to make the music sensual
[1:55:18] sexual
[1:55:21] perverted
[1:55:22] we're not here working to make love to
[1:55:26] God with a natural flesh
[1:55:29] we're here to make love to him through
[1:55:32] the spirit of God to the praise of God
[1:55:35] [Applause]
[1:55:39] you see those people they they sing so
[1:55:42] sensual
[1:55:44] [Music]
[1:55:48] what is the world what did President say
[1:55:50] when the man when they got the Holy
[1:55:51] Ghost those people in Africa that know
[1:55:54] nothing they didn't know the clay said
[1:55:55] they covered themselves
[1:55:57] and guess what the church world's doing
[1:55:59] she's uncovering herself she's showing
[1:56:01] she's a testimony of just what
[1:56:03] Revelation said she'd be miserable
[1:56:05] wretched blind and naked in North
[1:56:08] they're so happy at their tattoos
[1:56:12] they're so happy with their earrings
[1:56:14] have you heard this song brother Richie
[1:56:16] no I have not
[1:56:19] don't do something for you I said yes it
[1:56:22] makes me sick
[1:56:27] [Music]
[1:56:28] if sin does not make you sick I can see
[1:56:32] you're still have the appetite of the
[1:56:34] flesh
[1:56:35] if you walk and see perversion and it
[1:56:38] doesn't bother you
[1:56:40] now you need a change
[1:56:43] of appetite
[1:56:45] you know what our problem is we've let
[1:56:48] the world become so common to us that we
[1:56:50] can't determine what's God and what's
[1:56:52] the world
[1:56:55] you can't tell me you're a daughter of
[1:56:57] God and shack up with Satan all week
[1:56:59] [Music]
[1:57:03] people don't even know it and they're
[1:57:04] under the spirit of leprosy
[1:57:06] because their appetite is the flesh why
[1:57:09] did the leprosy attack the flesh because
[1:57:11] that's where the weakness begins
[1:57:16] door record
[1:57:18] Jesus said you'd been better off you
[1:57:20] hadn't known
[1:57:21] what about people that do know and
[1:57:22] they're still doing it
[1:57:24] do we not understand that is Iniquity he
[1:57:27] that knoweth to go good and doeth it not
[1:57:34] God help us brother you know the only
[1:57:36] way we're going to line up we got to be
[1:57:39] born again
[1:57:43] we don't need a modern music
[1:57:46] what's wrong with the music we already
[1:57:48] have Brother John
[1:57:50] let me ask you this question
[1:57:52] I'm going to ask you a question now
[1:57:54] let's say brother Stephen
[1:57:56] you love this certain kind of candy bar
[1:57:58] maybe it's a Mars we'll say it's Mars
[1:58:00] candy bar
[1:58:01] and you you'd eat it if I give it to you
[1:58:04] because that's what you like that's what
[1:58:05] that's what you have this let's just say
[1:58:07] it's something good I mean it won't hurt
[1:58:10] you ain't no seeing anything
[1:58:12] but here I'm going to wrap it in in full
[1:58:14] and I'm going to drop it in the port of
[1:58:17] John
[1:58:18] and I'm going to tell you
[1:58:21] is brother Stephen it's in there
[1:58:24] but you're going to have to keep
[1:58:25] reaching out and get it if you want it
[1:58:29] think about it think about it when you
[1:58:31] reach into those CDs
[1:58:36] to pull those songs out and you come to
[1:58:38] church and say Pastor pray for me I'm
[1:58:42] depressed
[1:58:45] where did you reach
[1:58:47] what did you obtain when you reached was
[1:58:51] it worth the reach
[1:58:53] [Applause]
[1:58:58] was it worth it then you come to church
[1:59:01] and you stink
[1:59:05] you come smelling like the table of
[1:59:08] vomits
[1:59:10] and you expect my God to sit down and
[1:59:12] eat with you
[1:59:16] didn't David tell us he said he'd
[1:59:19] leadeth me
[1:59:20] Miss dad still waters
[1:59:24] Steel Waters cause a lamb gets nervous
[1:59:31] Troubled Waters
[1:59:33] I can't drink from there
[1:59:37] to move too fast too and everybody wants
[1:59:40] to speed everything up
[1:59:42] then brother Graham said they'll speed
[1:59:44] up not us
[1:59:46] huh
[1:59:48] we'll get right in there
[1:59:52] oh Hallelujah
[1:59:56] you gotta cross and the dimensions at
[1:59:58] the rights the same speed is the only
[2:00:00] thing that'll bring you in there don't
[2:00:02] be too fast don't be too slow
[2:00:05] just stay steady
[2:00:08] Reverend said I love the more oak trees
[2:00:10] they stay steady when the storm comes
[2:00:15] oh Hallelujah
[2:00:16] praise be to God as you're thankful for
[2:00:19] the truth
[2:00:20] oh my listen to this in The Thirst I'm
[2:00:22] gonna try to let you go trying to I'm
[2:00:25] trying to try and hand it up here he
[2:00:28] said
[2:00:28] and there's nothing can satisfy that
[2:00:32] thirst that's in the human being
[2:00:34] serpent knew that look we just talked
[2:00:36] about that nothing can satisfy that
[2:00:38] amen I don't care what you do when I was
[2:00:40] out in the world nothing satisfied me
[2:00:43] I look for it in drugs brother Stephen I
[2:00:45] look for it in alcohol I look for it in
[2:00:48] rock and roll I look for it in Soul
[2:00:50] music I look for it in jazz music but I
[2:00:53] could not find Jesus
[2:00:57] no I didn't
[2:01:00] you know why the people say you're so
[2:01:02] hard but originally because I used to
[2:01:04] worship Him
[2:01:06] I know what he's like brother Steve I
[2:01:08] never forgot what he desires
[2:01:11] he desires worship hmm
[2:01:15] do you know music was the only thing
[2:01:18] that was created in heaven for worship
[2:01:22] and he put Satan over it
[2:01:29] Satan says I know I can't stop them from
[2:01:31] worshiping him but we're going to
[2:01:33] worship him like I do
[2:01:37] foreign
[2:01:42] God help us
[2:01:45] oh my then we got another one that wants
[2:01:47] to change the appetite we're going to
[2:01:49] jump in I'm in the water now I like it
[2:01:54] I like swimming in the truth
[2:01:58] it's up to us to swim or sink
[2:02:02] you know why many drown because they
[2:02:05] never learned how to swim
[2:02:09] you didn't God didn't taste the fish how
[2:02:12] to swim he just put him in the water
[2:02:16] God has not taught us to believe he's
[2:02:19] created the believer in US
[2:02:23] oh Hallelujah Hallelujah my goodness
[2:02:26] thank God Hallelujah but we got one
[2:02:30] Spectrum
[2:02:31] but just listen to tapes
[2:02:36] hey I am if you get to the place where I
[2:02:40] have to tag you my brother Stephen has
[2:02:41] to tell you to listen your appetite's
[2:02:44] messed up
[2:02:47] but see you don't really know he takes a
[2:02:49] good thing like listen to it we
[2:02:50] shouldn't listen
[2:02:51] we should ask how we know
[2:02:53] the word because we needed a teacher
[2:02:56] we need to profit
[2:03:01] ain't you thankful for the truth
[2:03:04] we needed somebody to tell us
[2:03:07] scriptures Never Lie
[2:03:09] he said I'll not reveal nothing
[2:03:13] until I reveal it to my servants to
[2:03:15] Prophet first
[2:03:20] but we got this spectrum and brother
[2:03:22] Stephen as I begin to look at that you
[2:03:24] know what it is
[2:03:26] it takes away the value
[2:03:34] just don't like people don't make people
[2:03:37] happy birthday makes people mad but I'm
[2:03:39] going to tell the truth and if it makes
[2:03:41] you mad then get right
[2:03:43] [Music]
[2:03:46] because the truth don't make people mad
[2:03:49] if you're not doing right you could do
[2:03:51] right
[2:03:54] he took away the value and then when
[2:03:56] they do preach
[2:03:58] they put it in they sit there like
[2:04:02] they're looking and listening to a tape
[2:04:04] they lose the ability to pull from the
[2:04:08] Life Ministry
[2:04:11] Satan does this
[2:04:12] have to stay home and listen to tape go
[2:04:14] ahead
[2:04:15] you can't do it and be a real Christian
[2:04:17] you'll die
[2:04:19] the longer you lay in the water the
[2:04:21] rotner you get
[2:04:23] until you learn to swim
[2:04:26] you're rot
[2:04:30] that's the truth
[2:04:33] a good thing brother Stephen see how
[2:04:35] crude he is how subtle he said I'll just
[2:04:38] change their appetite and they say
[2:04:41] you've got to put brother Brown back in
[2:04:43] the Pulpit God took him out how can man
[2:04:45] put him in
[2:04:47] foreign
[2:04:55] the fivefold ministry is the prophet to
[2:04:57] the bride
[2:05:02] that's exactly right the revelation of
[2:05:06] the word we're just repeaters of the
[2:05:08] word I know they say oh you're just a
[2:05:10] parrot I'd rather be a parent than a
[2:05:12] death mute
[2:05:19] you know what we're doing what did the
[2:05:22] prophet say he said just say what I say
[2:05:24] he said you preachers you take this
[2:05:27] message
[2:05:28] which was the Bible
[2:05:31] show me where he missed it in the Bible
[2:05:35] show me
[2:05:36] show me I can't find it
[2:05:38] [Music]
[2:05:41] then I'll show you where you missed it
[2:05:43] in the Bible
[2:05:44] [Music]
[2:05:50] oh Hallelujah
[2:05:53] it has to come that way
[2:05:55] but it takes away the value yeah I'm
[2:05:57] against that
[2:05:58] if you don't want to listen to the tapes
[2:06:00] I don't care who you are if it ain't in
[2:06:02] your heart to do it you're not going to
[2:06:03] do it
[2:06:05] I mean if I and after Pastor tell you
[2:06:08] you want to listen this because I just
[2:06:10] want to preaching on that's all right
[2:06:13] I mean we we did a man that's ordained
[2:06:15] of God to do things
[2:06:17] you're supposed to do it
[2:06:19] I know this
[2:06:21] God help me say it in the word it's
[2:06:22] balanced not to where it throws you off
[2:06:25] to one side or the other
[2:06:27] I'm staying in the middle of the road
[2:06:29] I'm Walking the Tightrope
[2:06:32] I'm coming The Razor's Edge
[2:06:35] I like what brother Neville said one
[2:06:37] time he said unless you've been can
[2:06:38] become a spiritual tapeworm you'll never
[2:06:40] ever be able to walk across the sword of
[2:06:43] the word
[2:06:45] because it will cut you off one way or
[2:06:47] the other
[2:06:50] you must know how to walk
[2:06:52] when you're crossing the word
[2:06:55] because the word Cuts going
[2:06:58] and coming
[2:06:59] well and I heard a brother one time he
[2:07:02] said man I'm gonna throw that out there
[2:07:03] I'm just gonna cut that people up I said
[2:07:04] brother it's a boomerang
[2:07:07] I said you throw it out there I said
[2:07:09] it's coming right back at you
[2:07:13] we don't throw it out there
[2:07:14] [Music]
[2:07:16] we let God use the sword
[2:07:20] but we got to have a balance
[2:07:22] yes we should listen and I listen to him
[2:07:24] nobody has to tell me to listen to it
[2:07:26] God might move on brother Stephen listen
[2:07:28] to this message he might move on me to
[2:07:29] listen to this other message
[2:07:31] but when we come together we're saying
[2:07:33] the same thing
[2:07:36] that's the paradox
[2:07:38] is the spirit and the bride are saying
[2:07:40] the same thing
[2:07:43] when the Bible tells us do not stay home
[2:07:47] but assemble yourselves together even
[2:07:49] more so
[2:07:49] [Applause]
[2:07:51] oh my God I almost want to read
[2:07:52] something right here can I go here
[2:07:54] no Satan's running my time I see him
[2:07:56] jumping on that on that clock because
[2:07:58] he's a creature of time I told him and I
[2:08:00] said Satan you know what
[2:08:02] I'm glad you are a creature of time
[2:08:05] I really am because I don't have an
[2:08:07] expiration date and you do
[2:08:11] because you're going to decrease
[2:08:14] and I'm increasing
[2:08:25] the Holy Spirit
[2:08:27] speaking in the scriptures tonight said
[2:08:29] we might serve him all the days of our
[2:08:31] life in Holiness before him that
[2:08:34] cleanliness and Holiness but today you
[2:08:36] can mention the word holy and people
[2:08:39] laugh at it
[2:08:40] that's the first thing they do they tell
[2:08:42] you
[2:08:43] you think you're better than you than I
[2:08:45] am because you don't cut your hair
[2:08:48] you think you're better than me because
[2:08:49] you don't wear pants
[2:08:51] you think you're better than me no I
[2:08:53] don't
[2:08:54] I'm a sinner saved by grace
[2:08:59] really
[2:09:01] that's their appetite
[2:09:03] he said without Holiness no man shall
[2:09:05] see God
[2:09:07] that's why people don't see
[2:09:09] that's why they don't see Brothers then
[2:09:12] he said laugh at it see how Satan's got
[2:09:15] the people all wrapped up I love what he
[2:09:18] said he said you are a slave
[2:09:20] and if you are a Christian you're a
[2:09:22] spawn slave to the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:09:27] what does that mean when you become a
[2:09:28] slave
[2:09:30] that shows that he
[2:09:33] he has become Lord over your life
[2:09:37] Paul said I'm not my own
[2:09:39] I've been bought with us with a price
[2:09:41] that means I don't have a say coming
[2:09:45] I don't have a word
[2:09:46] in myself I am a eunuch
[2:09:50] I have been circumcised of all my
[2:09:52] thinking
[2:09:54] all of my reasoning
[2:09:56] all my abilities to interpret the word
[2:09:59] under my own
[2:10:02] but only speak the word as it's
[2:10:03] interpreted to us
[2:10:06] you know what the fivefold ministry is
[2:10:08] it's dietitians
[2:10:15] you know when you're all messed up and
[2:10:17] your body's messed up they had to put
[2:10:19] you on a certain diet
[2:10:22] foreign
[2:10:23] not a suppressant
[2:10:26] never wants you to stop eating
[2:10:29] God don't want you to become bulimic
[2:10:32] he wants you to eat the right thing
[2:10:36] what is a dietitian it's a professional
[2:10:38] who has this special training in diet
[2:10:41] and nutrition
[2:10:45] that's what he made John he said eat the
[2:10:47] book John
[2:10:49] then you become the book John
[2:10:54] what are dietitians they're just ones
[2:10:58] that gives the nutritions that God has
[2:11:01] for us gives us the real vitamins we
[2:11:03] need to eat and the right kind of food
[2:11:06] to eat to make sure you're eating the
[2:11:07] right diet
[2:11:09] why people are so spiritually dead is
[2:11:11] because their diet
[2:11:13] is ruined
[2:11:15] look in Ephesians 4 11 and he gave some
[2:11:18] apostles
[2:11:20] some Prophets
[2:11:22] some evangelists I thought brother
[2:11:24] Stephen was going to get on my topic
[2:11:26] tonight and some pastors and some
[2:11:28] teachers
[2:11:29] for what for the perfecting of the
[2:11:31] Saints for the work of the ministry for
[2:11:34] the edifying of the body of Christ turn
[2:11:37] women to Second Timothy can we let's
[2:11:39] just show if we really think you know
[2:11:43] how bad we need to find full ministry
[2:11:45] let's just look
[2:11:47] um
[2:11:48] oh my goodness praise God second Timothy
[2:11:51] 3. amen let's just look at the diet that
[2:11:55] Paul told Timothy to feed the people
[2:11:59] oh glory be to God
[2:12:01] verse 14.
[2:12:03] let's go with verse 13. he said but evil
[2:12:05] men
[2:12:07] and seducers shall wax worse and worse
[2:12:10] deceiving and being deceived
[2:12:15] he said oh I love I read a quote the
[2:12:18] Abraham said I'm right here and I know I
[2:12:20] know time's running but you know what he
[2:12:22] said he'll let you brother Stephen
[2:12:25] he'll make you believe a lie when you
[2:12:27] reject the truth and he'll damn you for
[2:12:29] believing it
[2:12:32] said he turned you over to a reprobate
[2:12:34] mind
[2:12:37] oh look at this verse 14 he says but
[2:12:41] continue thou continue thou in the
[2:12:43] things which thou has learned
[2:12:47] and has been assured of
[2:12:49] knowing of whom thou Hast learned them
[2:12:54] don't repeat to God this was not a man
[2:12:56] it was God speaking through a man
[2:13:01] he said and that from a child that thou
[2:13:05] know the holy scriptures
[2:13:07] which are able to make the wise unto
[2:13:11] salvation through faith which is in
[2:13:14] Christ Jesus all scripture is given
[2:13:18] by inspiration of God
[2:13:20] it is profitable for Doctrine for
[2:13:24] reproof for correction for instruction
[2:13:27] in righteousness that the man of God may
[2:13:32] be perfect
[2:13:33] thoroughly Furnishing unto you all good
[2:13:38] works
[2:13:45] in Ministry
[2:13:46] that we might Supply God may give us
[2:13:50] the understanding of the word to give to
[2:13:53] you
[2:13:54] that you might know the instructions of
[2:13:56] God
[2:13:58] he said do what I have instructed you
[2:14:01] with
[2:14:03] have you noticed
[2:14:05] let's check our appetite before we go do
[2:14:08] you know when a woman
[2:14:09] brother Abram when your wife pregnant
[2:14:11] and she she has a strained appetite for
[2:14:14] things sometimes
[2:14:15] huh because there's a vitamin in there
[2:14:18] one day she may want pickles and ice
[2:14:20] cream that sounds crazy to you but
[2:14:23] there's a certain vitamin in that pickle
[2:14:25] and there's a certain vitamin in that
[2:14:27] ice cream that that baby wants
[2:14:30] [Music]
[2:14:31] um
[2:14:32] just obey the appetite of the spirit and
[2:14:36] feed not the appetite of the flesh
[2:14:39] the Bible tells us no no man after the
[2:14:41] flesh
[2:14:42] not even the man Christ Jesus
[2:14:46] we have to know one another by the
[2:14:48] spirit he said try the spirit in the
[2:14:50] words of God your appetite is what shows
[2:14:53] you are in the message perseverance this
[2:14:56] is it I'll let you go he said now that's
[2:14:59] the way to get something done
[2:15:02] he said now that's the way you
[2:15:03] congregation out there
[2:15:06] ought to be about your pastor
[2:15:08] that's when God will answer
[2:15:10] he said that's when God will answer
[2:15:12] that's right you've got to approach
[2:15:14] God's gifts the right way
[2:15:18] you cannot give a gift unless you know
[2:15:21] how to approach the gift
[2:15:25] Hallelujah
[2:15:27] he said that's right you've got to
[2:15:29] approach God's gifts the right way with
[2:15:32] reverence
[2:15:33] where's the reverence for the message
[2:15:34] anymore what's the reverence for the
[2:15:36] final four Ministry God help us oh
[2:15:39] that's just brother Stephen that's
[2:15:41] Brother Sam is it
[2:15:43] is it
[2:15:45] that's what they say oh it was just
[2:15:46] brother Brown's opinion
[2:15:49] I guess it was just Paul's opinion too
[2:15:52] I guess it was just Matthew's opinion
[2:15:55] Isaiah's opinion
[2:15:59] I guess it was Moses opinion when he
[2:16:01] told when God spoke and said write this
[2:16:04] I said on that same old devil brother
[2:16:06] Stephen
[2:16:09] he said reverence and the ministry is
[2:16:12] Minister gifts
[2:16:14] their gifts in the body five spiritual
[2:16:17] gifts
[2:16:18] that's predestinated and foreign of God
[2:16:22] to the church he said I know there's
[2:16:24] nine local gifts there's gifts anybody
[2:16:26] don't disrespect those either
[2:16:30] but these are God's office gifts I love
[2:16:34] how he says that the office of Apostles
[2:16:38] prophets teachers pastors and
[2:16:41] evangelists and we must respect them if
[2:16:45] we expect something from God let us
[2:16:48] stand
[2:16:49] that's where Satan is wanting to get us
[2:16:51] to do to disrespect
[2:16:53] the word of God
[2:16:55] and this if he can't get you to
[2:16:57] disrespect the word of God it just to
[2:17:00] get you to disrespect the man of God
[2:17:03] then when you disrespect the man of God
[2:17:05] little do you know you're disrespecting
[2:17:08] the word of God
[2:17:11] he said give double honor I'm not trying
[2:17:14] to get honor to me or brother Stephen or
[2:17:16] any of that ministers he said give
[2:17:17] double honor to those who labor in the
[2:17:20] house

[2:17:34] do you know what brother Brown said
[2:17:35] we're missing out on the Vitamin Power
[2:17:38] of the Holy Ghost
[2:17:41] that's the greatest vitamin you have
[2:17:44] need of
[2:17:45] oh Hallelujah in the message countdown
[2:17:48] he said when a when a man is filled with
[2:17:50] the Holy Ghost
[2:17:52] something's in him

[2:17:56] vitamins
[2:17:58] he said makes him praise God shout and
[2:18:02] get and act different
[2:18:04] because why he's no longer Earth bound
[2:18:10] Ary he is a he is setting in Heavenly
[2:18:13] places in Christ Jesus

[2:21:08] over and over and over it is telling me
[2:21:12] they're already struggling
[2:21:15] amen because when the word your attitude
[2:21:22] shows the level of your spirituality
[2:21:26] amen there is things about Christians
[2:21:29] that when we speak we click quickly
[2:21:31] and we agree and we move on and we see
[2:21:34] okay I see
[2:21:35] if you're wrong you just say I was wrong
[2:21:38] and that's it amen but when the word is
[2:21:41] being brought and you are wrestling and
[2:21:44] you're fighting and you're fighting all
[2:21:46] I'm seeing is you have exalted something
[2:21:51] above the word of God that's why you
[2:21:54] don't submit anymore you're trying to
[2:21:56] reason it out
[2:21:59] amen

[2:22:04] the angel in Jacob
[2:22:06] and I have to find a uh uh a correct
[2:22:10] spot to punch you pretty good heart
[2:22:13] so
[2:22:15] I'm speaking spiritually I'm not going
[2:22:17] to punch anyone
[2:22:19] I'm speaking spiritually
[2:22:21] let me say this way the holy spirit will
[2:22:24] show me where to strike pretty hard
[2:22:27] and to bring you a little bit
[2:22:31] to make you a little bit weaker so you
[2:22:34] can receive the word of God
[2:22:36] amen don't fight with the word
[2:22:40] humility
[2:22:41] is the ability
[2:22:43] to be able to humble yourself before the
[2:22:46] word
[2:22:47] when I say the ability
[2:22:50] to humble yourself before the word it
[2:22:54] doesn't means when the word come all the
[2:22:56] time you will say Amen
[2:22:59] sometimes when the world comes it's
[2:23:01] contrary to what your flesh is craving
[2:23:04] okay now that's where the true Son of
[2:23:08] God is now brought to a test
[2:23:11] now you need to rise above and say
[2:23:13] father I'm still struggling with this
[2:23:16] but
[2:23:18] because your word said
[2:23:20] let me humble myself
[2:23:23] maybe I don't understand why
[2:23:25] I don't understand why we go in this
[2:23:27] direction I don't understand why it's
[2:23:30] going this way but in obedience to your
[2:23:33] word
[2:23:34] let me stop down and step down as soon
[2:23:37] as you do that the devil is powerless
[2:23:41] everybody okay
[2:23:43] everybody okay so don't struggle with
[2:23:45] the word

[2:23:51] amen if staying at home missing church
[2:23:54] is wrong when somebody bring you the
[2:23:57] word and say staying at home is wrong
[2:24:00] don't wrestle with it
[2:24:03] don't begin to explain anything just say
[2:24:06] Lord help me
[2:24:08] the Lord knows my heart brother I'm
[2:24:10] trying the best that I can but I know
[2:24:12] what I'm doing is wrong but don't try to
[2:24:15] push to push to push
[2:24:17] because before you know it we get in a
[2:24:19] habit if you miss one Wednesday service
[2:24:22] you miss the second Wednesday service
[2:24:23] the third one is the service the fourth
[2:24:26] if you miss two months there is more
[2:24:28] chances you will never come to Wednesday
[2:24:31] and the devil will always convince you
[2:24:33] that you right to stay and to stream
[2:24:37] he will do that on Sunday he will do
[2:24:39] that for one month for two months and
[2:24:41] you will see people missing services for
[2:24:44] just a little bit of reason

[2:25:05] work because you're not feeling good but
[2:25:07] you will cancel church because you don't
[2:25:09] feel good
[2:25:11] if you're wrong don't wrestle
[2:25:15] amen when the word comes when you see
[2:25:17] the scripture coming the first time the
[2:25:19] second time the third take your hand off
[2:25:22] amen because you might find yourself
[2:25:25] fighting against God
