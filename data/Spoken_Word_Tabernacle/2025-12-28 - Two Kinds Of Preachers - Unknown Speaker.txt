TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[music] WE FOUND OUT THAT IN JOHN CHAPTER 6, buckle up my friend. &gt;&gt; Verse 70, THE BIBLE SAY JESUS SAY JESUS ANSWERED THEM AND SAY, "HAVE I NOT WHAT? &gt;&gt; Chosen you 12." &gt;&gt; JESUS CHOSE 12 disciple &gt;&gt; and he SAY AND ONE OF THEM is what? &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL. SO CALL IS NOT THE END. &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; MANY ARE CALLED [screaming] &gt;&gt; BUT the chosen. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; HE CHOSE 12. &gt;&gt; BUT ONE OF THEM WAS A DEVIL. &gt;&gt; SO THE TRUE BREAD AMONG THE DISCIPLE WAS ONLY 11 PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; But be careful. This one here preached the gospel. &gt;&gt; No, that's that's easy for you. &gt;&gt; Jesus say, "I have not chosen you." What? &gt;&gt; One of you is what? &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL. &gt;&gt; THAT DEVIL PREACHED THE GOSPEL. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Can you SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; THAT DEVIL PRAYED FOR THE SICK. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND THE SICK GOT HEALED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS A DEVIL. ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; SO THE MINISTRY OF THE SON OF MAN, &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; USUALLY PULL TWO KINDS OF PREACHER. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE USUALLY PULL TWO KIND OF MINISTRY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU WILL SEE PREACHER THAT ARE TRUE BRIDE &gt;&gt; AND THEY WILL BE ADDED THAT ARE DEVILS. IT'S HARD TO SAY, &gt;&gt; PREACHER, &gt;&gt; BUT BE CAREFUL. THOSE DEVIL WILL PREACH THE MESSAGE FOR A WHILE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. [screaming] &gt;&gt; THOSE DEVIL WILL DO MIRACLES. &gt;&gt; UH-HUH. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; UNTIL A CERTAIN LEVEL. &gt;&gt; UH-HUH. &gt;&gt; SO, BE CAREFUL WITH MIRACLE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND HEALING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; LORD, LORD, HAVE WE NOT CAST THAT DEVIL? THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; HAVE WE NOW PROPHESIED &gt;&gt; AND THE LORD SAY I NEVER KNEW YOU. &gt;&gt; SO THE MINISTRY OF THE SON OF MAN &gt;&gt; OR IN PLAIN WORD THE [screaming] MESSAGE OF BROTHER BRAHAM HAVE TWO KIND OF PREACHERS. [cheering] HE HAS PREDESTINATED PREACHERS [cheering] &gt;&gt; AND DEVIL PREACHER. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY YOU WATCH WHICH CHURCH YOU GOING TO. [cheering] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; JUDAH MAY PREACH THE GOSPEL AND AFTER A WHILE HE WILL DEVIATE. AFTER A WHILE, HE WOULD DETACH &gt;&gt; from the group. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEM that was already it's obvious. &gt;&gt; If you detach from the from the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. You collapse. &gt;&gt; So, a new invention is coming. &gt;&gt; It's already on &gt;&gt; where we detach from the message, but we stay IN THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; THE P THE FIRST THE FIRST LINEAGE OF JUDAH &gt;&gt; WAS LEAVING THE MESSAGE AND WHEN THEY LEAVE THEY COLLAPSE. &gt;&gt; THEY LOSE EVERYTHING &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE MESSAGE IS WHAT BUILD THEM UP. SO ARE THEY THAT ARE STILL AMONG THE GROUP ALREADY CAUGHT THEIR VISION &gt;&gt; THAT IF YOU PUBLICLY DENOUNCE THE MESSAGE YOU WILL LOSE YOUR PAYCHECK. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Can you SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; SO BECAUSE OF THAT WE WILL STAY IN THE MESSAGE &gt;&gt; BUT DON'T GET THE PEOPLE TOO DEEP. [cheering] GIVE THEM ENOUGH RELIGION, &gt;&gt; BUT DON'T TAKE THEM IN THE THIRD POOL. &gt;&gt; You don't get me, my friend. &gt;&gt; Preach, brother. &gt;&gt; I don't know. &gt;&gt; PREACH TO THEM LIKE BAPTIST. &gt;&gt; PREACH TO THEM LIKE PENTECOSTAL. &gt;&gt; PREACH TO THEM LIKE METHODIST. BUT DON'T GET INTO THE MYSTERIES &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE MYSTERIES IS WHERE LIFE IS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; KEEP THEM WARM [screaming] UP. &gt;&gt; MICROWAVE THE CONGREGATION. MICROWAVE THE CONGREGATION. KEEP THE CONGREGATION WARM [screaming] UP. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? BUT DON'T TOUCH THE STAFF. &gt;&gt; Am I reading a different Bible? &gt;&gt; Who chose Judah &gt;&gt; who gave Judah the ministry? &gt;&gt; Jesus himself &gt;&gt; AND HE HIMSELF SAID, "BUT IT'S A DEVIL." &gt;&gt; SO IF SOMEBODY DON'T LIKE THE MESSAGE, DON'T WORRY. IT'S ONLY AN INDICATION THAT THE MESSAGE IS RIGHT. &gt;&gt; You don't understand me. &gt;&gt; IF EVERYBODY THAT THAT believe the message, no one have refused the message, something is wrong with the message &gt;&gt; BECAUSE JESUS CHRIST IS THE SAME. &gt;&gt; WHATEVER THEY DID TO HIM, THEY MUST DO IT NOW. WHEN THEY BEGIN TO LEAVE THE MESSAGE, WE SAY GOOD STUFF. &gt;&gt; NOW WE KNOW WHAT WE GOT. [cheering] &gt;&gt; NOW WE GOT THE SON OF MAN. &gt;&gt; NOW WE KNOW FOR SURE WE ARE IN THE RIGHT PLACE BECAUSE WHATEVER JUDAH DID NEVER INFLUENCE OTHER DISCIPLE. [cheering] &gt;&gt; I hope we together. &gt;&gt; I hope we together. IN JOHN CHAPTER 6 VERSE 666, IT WAS NOT ONLY THE MINISTER, THE CONGREGATION, &gt;&gt; THE DISCIPLE, MANY OF THEM LEFT JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE HE SAYING EXCEPT THE MAN EAT WATER &gt;&gt; AND DRINK WATER. &gt;&gt; THEY HAD A PROBLEM WITH THAT MYSTERY. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? AND THEY BEGIN TO LEAVE ALL OF THEM. &gt;&gt; AND JESUS TURNED AROUND. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE DIDN'T WORRY ABOUT LOSING PEOPLE IN THE CONGREGATION. &gt;&gt; HE LOOK AT THE 11. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "WHAT ARE YOU DOING? &gt;&gt; YOU ARE SO [screaming] GOOD." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT THE SPOKESMAN PETER CAME OUT. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "WHY DO WE GO &gt;&gt; IN ETERNITY? ME AND YOU, [cheering] WE'RE DANCING TOGETHER. We came with you. WE CAME FROM YOU. WHERE DO [screaming] WE GO? [cheering] &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together. &gt;&gt; I don't know if we're together. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORD, IN OTHER WORD, what Peter was telling Jesus Christ, he said, "DO YOU KNOW WHERE OUR ADDRESS IS? &gt;&gt; OUR ADDRESS IS IN HEAVEN." YES. &gt;&gt; SO WHERE DO WE GO IN HELL? WE DON'T HAVE AN ADDRESS THERE. &gt;&gt; WHERE ELSE SHOULD WE GO? &gt;&gt; YOU [screaming] THE ONLY ONE &gt;&gt; THAT HAVE ETERNAL LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; CAN YOU SWALLOW THIS? &gt;&gt; I'm just appetizing. Can you swallow this? &gt;&gt; PETER SAID THAT WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST, DID I SAY SOMETHING WRONG? &gt;&gt; PETER GOT THE HOLY GHOST ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST. IN OTHER WORDS, EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT BORN AGAIN YET, [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; NO ONE CAN MOVE YOU FROM THIS MESSAGE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S A MATTER OF THE SEED. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; I DON'T UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING. I DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING. BUT I JUST KNOW ONE THING. THERE IS SOMETHING IN ME &gt;&gt; THAT LOVE THIS MESSAGE. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. [cheering] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? I have chosen you 12. &gt;&gt; One of you is a devil. &gt;&gt; So don't be surprised in the group that is called from God, &gt;&gt; devils are there. &gt;&gt; I didn't call them devil. Jesus say devil. &gt;&gt; Son of hell, &gt;&gt; son of predestination. Are we together? And if you notice, he always attached to money. &gt;&gt; ALL HE WORRY ABOUT IS [screaming] TI AND OFFERING. [cheering] &gt;&gt; IT'S A PAYCHECK, &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT THE SOUL. &gt;&gt; HE'S WARMING THE MESSAGE BECAUSE OF A PAYCHECK. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? IN JOHN 13, &gt;&gt; Jesus looked at Judah. He said, "Whatever you want to do, &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't say, "Brother, why are you leaving the message, &gt;&gt; BROTHER? YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS TRUTH." HE SAY, "NO, &gt;&gt; I know what you want to do. &gt;&gt; Do it." &gt;&gt; And do it how? &gt;&gt; In other words, make your show quickly. &gt;&gt; AMEN. PUT IT ON YOUTUBE QUICKLY. &gt;&gt; PUT IT ON YOUTUBE QUICKLY. WHEN YOU FINISH WITH ALL YOUR EVIDENCE AND STUPIDITY, THEN THE WORD UNFOLD. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; NOW WHEN JUDAH IS OUT, &gt;&gt; GO VISIT. &gt;&gt; Go search your Bible. Jesus never called the disciple children. Only when Judah was out, &gt;&gt; when Judah was out, HE SAID, "CHILDREN," &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE KNEW NOW THESE ARE MINE. &gt;&gt; "ALL THAT THE FATHER GIVEN ME, I WILL LOSE NONE &gt;&gt; EXCEPT JUDAH." &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; SO WHEN JUDAH LEFT THE MESSAGE, &gt;&gt; yes sir. [cheering] &gt;&gt; WHEN HE LEFT THE MESSAGE, NOW JESUS CAME BACK AGAIN. &gt;&gt; YES. He says that YE HAVE NOT WHAT &gt;&gt; CHOSEN ME &gt;&gt; BUT I HAVE WHAT &gt;&gt; CHOSEN YOU. &gt;&gt; WHY IS HE REPEATING CHOSEN AGAIN? &gt;&gt; HE ALREADY SAID CHOOSING IN JOHN 6. &gt;&gt; NOW HE COMES BACK AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DIDN'T choose me. &gt;&gt; I am the one that look at the at the at the at the whole sheet and I cut you off. &gt;&gt; And I say I pull this. &gt;&gt; This is the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. I am the ONE THAT CHOSE YOU AND did what? &gt;&gt; Ordained you &gt;&gt; that you should do what? &gt;&gt; Go bring forth fruit. &gt;&gt; Bring forth water. &gt;&gt; Fruit. &gt;&gt; If you are bringing fruit, where is the fruit? &gt;&gt; Inside of you. &gt;&gt; The fruit only come out. &gt;&gt; The fruit must be first in you &gt;&gt; for you to bring fruit. &gt;&gt; And the fruit is a seed. &gt;&gt; And the seed tells your nature. &gt;&gt; Are we together? So when you bring in THE FRUIT, IT SHOWS the nature of the tree that you are. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BROWN SAID THE FRUIT WAS THE WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO YOU MUST BE THE WORD TO PRODUCE THE WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE EVERY SEED MUST REPRODUCE AFTER ITS OWN KIND. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We clear so far now. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to Luke 19.
