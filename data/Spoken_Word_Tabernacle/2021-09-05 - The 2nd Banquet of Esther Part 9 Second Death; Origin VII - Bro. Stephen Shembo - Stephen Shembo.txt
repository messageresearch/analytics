it's true it kind of changed truth amen are there any praise reports i mean sorry other praise reports yeah yeah brother you wanna thank you um so the day my mother and father got in an accident like literally two minutes before like literally like two minutes before i got an email from google the internship i've been trying to get in since like the middle of the summer and first the first evil they sent me was saying i was put on the waiting list and so i just prayed about it and you know i'm on a waiting list that does not mean i'm not accepted right so two minutes before they called me i got an email and i was i was in the middle of the class like class was still going and it was like yo i was accepted i was i just jumped i said thank you jesus i was so happy like i'm like oh my god so then like i was like i was about to call him was like the the missile dismissal bell ring and we were leaving and i was going to call them they caught me first and then my mom was like we got an accident with you know 18 wheels like a truck okay you know but it's just a guy who works in mysterious ways so i just want to give him the glory and the praise and just he's an awesome guy hallelujah amen praise god praise god [Applause] god bless everyone this morning um when i went out to kentucky it was actually a covet outbreak um but what uh my wife gave the testimony part way last week but the fullness thereof was that the um the individual on my team that caught the virus i actually sat next to him for two hours didn't catch it but before i before i actually went the um there's an app that i read a message app called family alter and you know there's a lot of inspiration given in that what i normally do is sometimes if my day gets too far gone you know i can pray every day and i can read my script but in the app it gives you a quote and it gives you scripture so you know you're really killing two birds with one stone so when i went there i had when i read it the scriptures told me that the lord was with me just an anointing came over my heart and i didn't know why but i said okay lord you're with me out here but unbeknownst to me he said he got the shot the vaccine he was raving about the vaccine shot you know but he still caught it every day this gentleman bought me food from from hand to hand bought me food every day i was there not only did he buy me the food every day but when when you uh on a big job like like as such when you're placing a lot of concrete you know you're there for i mean that job i was just pouring concrete for 12 hours straight so there's times with out of you just restroom he had to come and take the controller from me to operate it still nothing you know so i'm i'm and on top of that as i was there throughout that week i had a chance to testify to some of the individuals out there and i didn't know jeffersonville was less than an hour away from me so as i spoke to the individual and started testifying to him he started to inquire now when i come back we get in this accident there's a lot of other things going on so in my mind i'm like okay lord you're doing something and when i checked the book of acts you know when when the lord started moving to demonstrate his power it was always uh persecution done to his people now they told me that i needed to go back so i believe i'm going back to deal with that soul so just just keep us in prayer but i just wanted to give god praise because to see a supernatural move like that to where that that virus didn't touch me and i was next to him and there's no reason that i shouldn't have caught it mentally thinking but by god's grace was about the power of god i didn't catch him that's just a testimony to the power that we're entering into right now and i thank the lord for it praise god amen praise god praise god amen i totally relate to your testimony brother charles amen was there anyone to put their hand up brother yes bro god bless your sense i just wanted to thank the lord for his protection over me uh my family usually every day like four days a week i go pick up my mom from work we live near huntersville and her job is in south carolina near rock hill so it's about an hour drive my job doesn't require me to really doesn't really allow me to get that tired because it's very easy so for some reason i think last thursday last wednesday after church i was really tired so after i came coming into church i would head back home i tried to get some sleep but when i woke up around two in the morning to go get her i was still extremely tired so i put myself a coffee i had a guy into the car i prayed just a quick prayer father protect me from going into coming back amen so i got into the highway around 1 in 1 588 and the whole drive from my house from the highway to her workplace which is about 45 50 minutes i fell asleep there is nothing that i remember for that moment for those minutes from entering the highway to her place i didn't know how i made it to work to her work the next thing i know i was in the parking lot and she was knocking on a door to get in so she got in the car i was surprised how i made it there and i didn't know what happened but in my heart the entire time i was playing the gospel song in the car and the entire ride i was saying thank you god and i wanted to thank him for his protection over me and my praise god family amen amen amen thank you lord god is true amen are there any prayer requests that you want to bring before the lord at this time as we ask that the offering be picked up at this time

who's gonna make one another doing do it you who he's gonna make you what he wants you to be not you making yourself what you want to be not you making yourself what he wants you to be no it is him making you what he wants you to be aren't you happy for that in other words you have nothing to do nothing brother david give me more thank you very much musician amen god bless you hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord amen i'm glad he can make us what he wants us to be amen so my hands are not supposed to be in i need to get my hand off amen yeah don't worry you wake up before i forgot the scripture thank you all right let's go to psalm chapter 69 we appreciate everybody this morning if there is a family member god richly bless you we appreciate you all and we greet you all in the name of jesus christ how many are on board with the sermon everybody on board nobody behind anybody behind okay blessed be the name of the lord we don't want anyone to lag behind nobody we must fight be brave you know that all right can't ride a neither okay ah you heard brother robert [Laughter] amen psalm chapter 69 we read this psalm before and we're going to dig into it because we need to pull judah out of here amen anybody understood the abiliter okay blessed be the name of the lord 22 let their table became become a snare in other words a trap before them you know david's prayer now you understand why he was praying like this not for the elect and he was doing that under the inspiration of the holy spirit so it was not actually david but it was the holy spirit because david one time was crying at his palace in his palace my father my father well i have that forsaken me the soldier thought like what is going on somebody abandoned the king say uh-uh it's not me somebody was coming down the road who's gonna cry amen he says verse 22 and that which should have been for their welfare let it become a trap so god sent something to them for their good for their welfare david said take that turn it into what into a trap the stone that was precious to somebody else but that same stone can be a a trap in other words a stumbling block to someone else depending on your origin you might be seated amen let their eyes be darkened the word make them blind labor day weekend a lot of folks out [Laughter] let their eyes be darkened that they see not and make their lawns continually to shake pour out your wrath your indignation upon them and let your wrathful anger take hold of them if you notice here it's not one person it is many people them them them their means the many plural a lot of people amen verse 25 let there not his habitation let their habitation be desolate so right here david is praying and he wants there i want you to keep that in mind there it is many people maybe millions amen their habitation be what they want that to be desolate amen blessed be the name of the lord let their habitation be dazzling and let none dwell in their tent again their tent is plural not singular so they will have tents they will have habitation they're gonna dwell in those tent they will dwell in those habitation but after a while that habitation need to be voided of them in other words that habitation need to be empty amen and nobody is supposed to dwell there hallelujah why for they persecute him whom you have smitten who was meeting of god christ they persecuted him was he one person day day day there amen for they persecuted him whom you have smitten and they talked to the grief of those whom you have water wounded add iniquity to their iniquity there and let them plural not come into your righteousness in other words block them so that they will never be able to come to righteousness because if you come to righteousness you are saved in other words do not save them holy spirit you don't want some other people to be saved when we want to save everybody amen let them be blooded out of the book so right here not only are their habitation going to be desolate but what happened is they are blocked to salvation everybody clear they are blocked to salvation and not only are they blocked to salvation because of their transgression their name have to be removed from the book of life anybody clear amen why they persecuted christ and by doing that they're losing their right to salvation and they also having their name removed from the book of life to have a name removed from the book of life it means your name was there the problem is the name will not remain amen abide like a biafra you remember amen let them be bloated out of the book of the living and not be written with the so the book of life is truly the book of the righteous you see that but among the righteous among the good seed somebody planted a wrong seed but it will come a time when the wrong seed need to be removed so that the righteous will no longer dwell with the one who is a wicked amen in other words some people will have their name in the book of life but their name will be removed and those people will never be able to reach salvation amen because of what because of where they came from amen the book of life will not hold their name they cannot remain in the book of life their name have to be taken out of the book of life amen so everybody who's among theirs number one their habitation will be desolate number two they won't reach salvation they can be in the group but they won't reach salvation and number three their names are gonna be taken out i'm going this way because that devil outside of the message is very wicked amen and if somebody comes and begin to question you and corner you now you have a devil answer that you can give it to them amen so before i continue i want you to always keep this principle especially young people in the book of matthew chapter 26 verse 17 and it's very important if not you're going to be blurred in a scripture and the message will be tough for you the bible says in chapter 17 here in verse 17 now the first day of the feast of our library of eleventh bread the disciple came to jesus saying unto him where will thou that we prepare for thee to eat the what the passover so right here in matthew it's talking about the first day of the first of the feast of 11 bread and it's a preparation for the passover everybody clear now when you go to the book of mark on on chapter 14 verse 12 the bible repeat again the same thing but now it's not matthew because matthew is a lion he's an apostle hey but here and mark is a pastor because he's the oxen is a knox of the team go check your website you're going to see that quote there and the first day of the 11th bread when they killed the water the same thing his disciples said unto him where will da that we go and prepare that that may eat the water same scripture here same story everybody clear in the book of luke who is now a teacher because luke was a doctor he was an m.d dan kim you need that scripture you let me know i will give it to you and then came the day of the water unleavened bread unleavened bread unleavened bread window passover passover passover must be water so if you want to understand this story very well you need to put those three scriptures together make sense if you only get one scripture you're not gonna get the full picture of it why are you pointing to this we already understand it's the same story number two eighteen and he said go into the city who will go into the city how many based on that scripture do you know their name do you know their number so based on matthew we know that he sent disciple we don't know who whether it's bar tell me whether it's peter whether it's andrew or john we don't know whether it's look amen and how many disciples we don't know whether it's two whether it's three or four or five we don't know so if you stuck with matthew with an apostle he's gonna give you a blur vision he's giving you the vision but it's not too clear everybody clear so if we only preach you matthew are we okay if we continue with the church and every day in the church matthew is the one preaching you will get a panoramic view of the message you can grasp the message but it's going to be in a general way when they ask you about the message your answers are going to be general god sent the disciple that's all i know because you've been preached by matthew okay let's continue to search a man and say unto him the master said if my time is at hand i will keep the passover at that house with my disciple and they what they disciple how many disciple what are their name my few can only stop there and they disciple we don't know who they are and we don't even know their name their number and they disciple because they were 12. so with matthew preaching to you brother uh enoch can say that god sent maybe 12 disciple brother mickey will say god sent for disciple he's still right because he says disciple 4 is plural 12 is plural 2 is plural three is plural hallelujah and the disciple did as jesus had appointed them and they made ready the water the passover now let's go to the pastor mark and see what's wrong with the pastor the pastor said in verse 13 and he sent forth how many do you want to have matthew alone or you want to have matthew and mark now [Applause] if brother mickey said four his answer is no longer good he was good under matthew everybody clear church i'm trying to shake away the loose feather amen so no more game in a message okay now whoever said three who has they say four or five or whoever say more than two is not correct now the pastor stabilizes you [Music] okay the pastor granted you more now you're a little bit stable amen we know now each disciple praise the lord plural praise the lord how many disciples two who are they we don't know it's too disciple somebody can say brother hamilton can say it was luke and john but a defense might say it was about telling me an angel they're right it's only two so you can pick two the devil still play around with you make sense now you will understand why a ministry can be attacked by the devil and not the other ministry did you get what i was saying do you get what i'm saying you're gonna see one ministry there are five four ministries but you see the devil attacking one more you will see the devil always try to destroy one to put a a bad test to one and the other one he can leave them alone [Music] the same scripture now we know it's true let's go to look mr doctor what's going on then came the day of the unleavened bread when the passover must be killed and he sent who and who now is clear and is precise anybody clear now ever clear now i'm going to say it because i'm among the people in my church that's why brother branham say when a pastor mark is a look you need that quote you see me can i say it again when pastor mark is luck brother branham said when a pastor is a teacher he said the gates of hell will do nothing toward that church amen everybody here thank you lord when jesus do you know the story of blind bartimaeus was he alone or were there many he was alone right after church see me or shoot me a text i'm gonna take you to matthew and i'm gonna show you the story of blind baltimore's that there were two blind men have you heard about it have you ever heard about it you see me after church ask me it's in the book of matthew who's saying the truth both of them are saying the truth everybody clear if you want see me after church ask me do you know the maniac that was living into the to on in the tombs how many maniacs were they one let me go with you in the book of matthew i'm gonna give you the same story and there were two maniacs did you know that i must shake you up now in the message anybody clear so when somebody came brother branham say here brother brandon say here matthew say to blind man matthew said to maniac the other gospel say one one who is contradicting the other who's saying the truth who are you gonna reject which gospel is true you see now everybody clear so if i bring you my few two blind man if i bring you matthew to maniac if you go to the other one it's one and it gives you more precision that this name was blind by the emails clear see what i'm saying keep that key you want to understand that story it's brand biotimes this is what you grow up with it in the message now you can chew out the food it was not bland bartimaeus alone there were two why did one say two one say one anybody clear so keep in mind this the key i'm trying to make you understand over and over god can't give a revelation uh can't give a first revelation than a second revelation if he did he will be changing his mind he can give a revelation and then add to it he's not changing the first as he did in the garden of eden when he promised the seed to the woman and then later designated that seed had to come through abraham and then later say it would come by the same bloodline in heaven but he was the water the same revelation he only give the people more information to help them and water but god's word can everybody clear one said the disciple once said to disciple and the other say peter and john now we understand it better and the devil cannot play with us anymore he cannot play with the numbers he can no longer play with the name because now we are precise [Music] based on what i said let's go to matthew chapter 10. everybody clear oh he's bringing one ministry above the other side go get the court out you wish i would not even seen that anybody clear if you see the devil attacking something you better wake up if the devil attacked your life a lot you better wake up you better understand that there gotta be something in me because this guy don't usually bother people like this if he's bothering me all the time there must be something in me that i have not discovered yet because some people they are quiet but they are attacking only one ah matthew chapter 10 are you there is everybody awake [Laughter] matthew 10 verse 1 keep everything in perspective and when he had called to him his water how many disciples did he call 12 disciples according to matthew the bible said he called 12 disciples anybody clear i'm gonna see the description he's talking to this disciple if i don't do this you won't understand where i'm traveling amen and he called to him his twelve disciple he gave them power against water unclean spirit to cast them out and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease including coronavirus is not a new demon [Applause] it is new to you he was already existed and the good news he has a beginning and it's going to have an end it is not eternal everybody clear the lake of fire is coming amen now the name of the disciple the 12th apostle in the beginning they say disciple now they're saying apostle apostle means somebody who they sent everybody here because they're sending them this their scripture flip to apostle now you're clear amen the 12 apostles are these first salmon who was called peter why was he put there the first an angel his brother james james the sons of zebedee and john his brother philip and bertelemy thomas and matthew the publican james the son of affairs and liberals whose surname was status summoned the canaanite and judas iscariot who also betrayed him so among these people we found out that who was also there judah number one they gave them power to cast out devils everybody clear and to heal all manners of sickness everybody clear number two we found out that among this disciple judah was there with reading matthew now verse 5 these 12 jesus sent forth and commanded them saying go not in the way of the gentile one into the city of the samaritan two enter not but gather go to the lost ship of the house of water three that's why brother branham said there is three group the jews the gentile and the samaritan did brother branham give you a scripture the message and the bible are perfectly in line anybody care let me continue and verse seven and as you go do what preach he told him when you go verse three third point go ahead and preach he said preach saying the kingdom of heaven is at hand heal the sick he already told them preach the leper raise the dead cast out devils freely you have received freely give provide neither gold nor silver nor brass in your purse in other words when you go you go with an empty purse because he's jehovah jarrah [Music] everybody clear i will provide i will take care of that journey i am the one sending you i must provide for your luggage don't even get money somebody will bring you money amen verse 10 know what strip for your journey neither two coats just take one suit i'm gonna be

inquire who in it is worthy you remember those words the son of peace you remember who is worthy and dare a bad till you go there and when you come into a house saluted and if the house be worthy what makes you worthy let your peace come upon it but if it be not worthy let your peace return to you remember the other time we show that if the son of peace in the house is in the house it is the son of peace that makes the house worthy if there is no son of peace we can give you peace anybody clear because he is our peace he is jehovah shalom and if you are a child of god you must be also a shalom amen and whosoever shall not receive you nor hear your word not read the word of jesus when you depart out of that house or city shake off the dust of your feet so according to matthew 12 disciple go ahead in every city cast out devils heal cleanse the leper judas was there preach the gospel do not take any script any bed go empty i'm gonna be taking care of it so if we preach to you matthew jesus only sent 12 disciples and he told them to preach that's a that's matthew anybody here you ready now let's go now to the book of luke chapter 10 matthew 10 and luke 10. the mathematics [Laughter] of god amen matthew say 12. brother robert already gathered okay brother calima got it did somebody else somebody else got it okay somebody else got it oh sister that's a guy who else natured okay let me help you up first one after these things the lord appointed at the water he didn't say the lord appointed 70. i'm i'm going this route because there is quote they are caught in a message if they corner you you will be spinning you don't know how to come out of it and this is your vaccine everybody here after these things the lord appointed other 70 the bible didn't say the lord appointed 70. clear he appointed other god had already 12 disciple then he appointed other makes sense so much so this apart from the 12 these were added make sense now so now according to luke he appointed how many according to luke he appointed them 70 who's saying the truth okay he appointed 70 also and sent them two and two look he's very detailed he doesn't play he doesn't want you to be in the air amen before his face into every city and place where he himself will come anybody clear therefore say he to them the harvest truly is great but the laborers are few pray you therefore the lord of the asbestos that he will send forth laborers into his harvest go your way behold i send you forth as lamb among wolves they are lambs among wolves go your ways behold i send you forth as lambs among wolf carry neither everybody clear now carry neither person or nor and salute no man by there i thought jesus said the 12th right now it is to the 70. can we no press no script check anybody clear did you see judah here brother branham said judah was here you see now your brother brother let's go and in in whatsoever house you enter first say peace be to this house you remember over there they just say if somebody's worthy now luke is giving you more detail because over there they if somebody is worthy give them your peace here luke is not talking about the twelve look he's talking about the other matthew only said twelve luke say ah twelve plus others now we got a picture anybody clear and if the son of peace now you see that here matthew didn't give you that if the son of peace be there your peace shall rest upon it if not it shall turn to you again in the same house remain eaten drinking such things as they give for the labor is worthy of his water your salary i just showed you that on my view go not from house to house and into whatever city you enter and they receive you each such things as are set before you and do what do what everybody see the world everybody see the board hear the sick check everybody clear heal the sick that are daring and say to them the kingdom of god is come near you what are they doing thank you brother anybody clear preaching check are you there but in whatever city you enter and they receive you not go your way out in the street of the same and say even the very dust of your city which cling on us we do wipe off against you notwithstanding be you sure of this that the kingdom of god is come near you everybody clear amen let me try to drop down on verse 17 and 70 return did he say the 12 and the 70 return with joy saying lord even the water anybody clear even the word the devil everybody here casting out devils even the devil are subject to us through your name everybody matthew say it's 12 disciple luke say it is 12 and other 70 but when jesus is coming back luke says he's talking to the 70. yet brother branham said he was also talking to the 12. show me that in the scripture america verse 18 and he said to them i beheld satan as lighting lightning fall from heaven that's why you see the rock and roll star when they they have a new album some of them will put like a lightning on top of the album they're not telling you the truth they're actually showing you lucifer because he came down like a lightning you'll see the rock and roll people putting a lightning it is talking about satan you see now and lightning from the heaven behold i give you power to thread on the serpent and scorpion and overall the power of the enemy he's adding now and nothing shall be by any means nothing shall by any means hurt you notwithstanding in this just not i don't want you to get happy when you start casting out devils that's not the main thing that's the third pool that's the first pool amen notwithstanding in this rejoice not because many shall come into me saying lord lord have we not done what caster devils in your name and jesus will say our never knew you so jesus said don't dwell there because it's still a mixed multitude it will be around that area anybody clear okay notwithstanding in this rejoice note that the spirit are subject to you but rather rejoice with yourself what because your names are written in what that's the main thing everybody here anybody clear he was talking to the seventy brother branham said he was talking to judah also therefore the name of judah was written my brother stephen where is that scripture that he was talking to judah he was talking to 12 here he was talking to 70. if you put it together he was talking to 82 people [Music] anybody clear brother stephen help me more job to verse 23. job 2 verse 23 oh brother robert betray me again job to verse 33 you found it and he turned him to his water are you okay he turned to his water and say perfectly blessed are the eyes which see these things that you so he was talking to the 70 and 12. brother branham was right the message is perfectly in line with the scripture but god hid it a certain way so that if you're not predestinated he's gonna block you so that you won't see it anybody clear so when you don't understand something again relax keep praying god knows how to unfold it if you come to argue against it god will block it everybody understand i read this same quote and i read the scripture and i say wait a minute he's talking to the twelve lord would you help me understand why brother branham says he was talking to judah i don't get it but your prophet is right it didn't take less than an hour then the lord opened everything i'm showing you here if i came with arrogancy against the prophet of god god will block it and let you go [Music] you got it now now let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy father and for everything you have been doing for us father we thank you for the holy spirit leading your children and leading this church lord i have done what every man that you give an ability can do but now it takes the holy spirit to unfold your word and bring it to the heart of your children father i commit this entire service unto the hand we rebuke the devil and his army and if anybody has been exposed or anybody's sick and didn't even know father upon the presence of the holy angel and the holy spirit in this place father may you touch them and heal him lord we rebuke every demonic spirit of virus we rebuke every slumbering spirit lord that is making people sleep in church in the name of jesus christ father made the power of the holy spirit job may you come lord and relax your children and speak to us lord in a mighty way in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you as you already been seated ever clear we on part nine of the second banquet origin it's part seven anybody clear on wednesday we demonstrated to you that there are two group we already know that and we says that the group on the right side because they came out of god they are eternal just like god is eternal everybody clear and on the left side it's the group of the devil and jesus already showed us that there is no connection no gene connection between him and the devil and his children ever care that's why christ said that of all that you have given unto me i have lost no one except the son of perdition because he doesn't belong to me he's not ma'am my child in other words amen and that group was not eternal but it's temporarily temporal and brother branham said the devil is not eternal everybody clear this origin is important not only to understand the second death but to understand who you are and this origin also shows you that if you came from the right origin you're gonna remain in the world the origin or your lineage will determine whether you can continue in the world or not we seen abiator on wednesday how he helped david he carried the ark of the covenant he was there consulting god but because of the wrong lineage abiado was not able to remain with david he have to rebel against david because the man was victim of his origin everybody clear brother branham say hungry people every man is trying to look beyond behind the curtain to see where he comes from amen and where he's going if you know where you're coming from it's going to tell you where you're going if you come from hell automatically you have a visa back to hell if you came from god you're going to go back to god and brother branham say everybody hungry people are trying to know where they come from and where they are going where they are going is not a big deal really if you know where you come from everybody clear if you won't teach it to your church and give the salvation that he need to his soul he is a son of god in his fallen state yet he is a son of god and he wants to see out yonder he long to see it so brother branham is showing here that sons of god wanted to know up beyond what is in the mortal womb they want to know where they came from and brother branham said you need to be taught to the church [Music] everybody fear god help we ministers to get to the place where we can do it introduced to them to the children of god the true and living god and they think that they're so hungerful after they have confessed and became water so when somebody is converted and become christian we need to bring the proper food that's going to satisfy your soul you cannot be 40 years old and continue to drink milk amen something is wrong ever clear but banham says here in the god who's reaching mercy he said now we are part of god you always was remove that pressure that you have to go somewhere amen where i need to preach quickly so you can leave now we are part of god you always was you don't remember it because you were only an attributing god you were only in his thinking we already explained you this your very name if it ever was on the book of life he was put there before the foundation of the world he knew what you were i am only saying this i'm only teaching this why not to mix up doctrine but to strengthen it out that we must get away from this fear and what so to remove faith from the children of god that uncertainty am i a child of god or not i got mad against my husband or maybe i should not do this because a christian is not supposed to do this yes a christian is not supposed to do this but that doesn't determine whether you're a child of god or not [Music] brother branham said the pharisees have the fruit of the spirit ten times more than jesus christ [Music] there were people that you thought believed the message more than you there were more bias to the message they were more long just to the message but when the test came they could not stay in the message they rejected the message so what is really showing who is the son of god [Music] when you were close to these people you thought they were more set than you and today the same people are wearing pants why are you not wearing pants why are you not wearing paint and somebody is wearing paint and you thought they were more spiritual than you hallelujah it is to remove this fear and scare you don't know who you are you are not going to be but now you are something god see you always wear the sons of god i am bringing you to the state to stop looking at yourself look at what god put in you and focus on the inside man if the inside man is line up with god it will bring the outside automatically in line with god the problem in the message we work with the outside man and we left the inside men and people became a bunch of hypocrites [Applause] 20 years in the message racist 20 years in the message can't get anything straight in line they don't understand nothing they don't want nothing from god yet they claim to be message believers start from your heart start from the inside prepare the heart malachi 4 came to turn there the heart of the children back to the pentecost once their heart is turned their body automatically will be aligned to the world it won't be a striving anymore it's gonna be a pleasure to serve god [Applause] if not you put a bunch of legalistic underprison i'm doing this if i don't do this they will say this hallelujah if you want to get upset get upset amen and let god clean that temple out of you [Applause] after you got upset you said father i don't like this nature i don't know how to get rid of it may you come and remove it when god remove it who does the sun have set free is free indeed [Applause] [Music] the message is not a religion hallelujah you always were a son of god jesus said if he abandoned me and my word in you saint john 15 if he abandoned me see have faith in him he abide in me and my word abide in you but for your word for his word to abide in you you must have a receiver you remember you must have an absorbent if not your his word have no place in you so if his word is already abiding in you it is telling you you are child of god hallelujah a bad in my word then you ask what you will now see he knew who he was therefore he had what self could produce when he knowed what he was if he abandoned me and my word in you then you know who you are and when you know who you are ask what you will and it shall be given to you the original help you understand who you are and when you know who you are it gives you faith and confidence and when you are approaching god you're not approaching a man who's always angry at you you're not approaching a man who is always disappointed at you because you got mad to your husband you are approaching a man who understands you a man who's your father a high priest that can be touched by your infirmity he understands you more than yourself because perfect love casts out what happened amen hallelujah we found out that in jude chapter uh verse five the bible said i will therefore put you in remembrance though you knew this once how did the lord having served the people out of the land of egypt after all destroyed them that believe not we found that on wednesday there were no faith no they were baptized under moses into the cloud drunk water everything but there was no faith to be mixed with the sermon but faith is a gift of god and it's given by grace how are you going to receive it save them first brought them out of egypt and then had to destroy them because they didn't continue with their message anybody clear this thing started by their father the devil had the position in heaven but for some reason he served god he was the right hand man of god just like airmen was the right-hand man of king hazaris but for some reason there is something in the devil that he cannot abide in the truth why because there is no truth into him amen so he could not stay on his throne on his position he need to go to a different position anybody clear now let's get into judah the bible says man and brethren this scripture must need have been fulfilled which the holy ghost by the mouth of who so the psalm was written by who ander the holy ghost by the mouth of david speak before concerning who go in the psalm and show me the name of judah open the book of psalm and show me the name of judah remember your name are written a certain way you remember in the bible you remember the bible so how can you chase brother branham by 11. come on the holy spirit spoke about who judah god showed me where the holy spirit said judah the holy spirit spoke about john the baptist god in the old testament show me john the baptist john the baptist could only tell you i am isaiah 40. so his name was written in symbols so when you say isaiah 40 something in john the baptist begin to bubble and only john the baptist will be quickened with that scripture hallelujah hallelujah that's why you heard jesus say this day this scripture has been worked he identified himself in the scripture [Music] hallelujah the holy ghost spoke spake in the mouth of david concerning who which was guide to them that took jesus he became a guide another guide four he was numbered with us and had obtained part of this ministry judah number one he was numbered not all israel is israel he was among the very disciples of jesus christ among these 12 judah was there judah was also there and his name was written in the book of life anybody clear what does he mean by stephen in john chapter 13 verse 10 and 11 the bible said jesus said to him he that is washed needed not safe to wash his feet but is clean every week the language of jesus is very complicated if you don't have the holy ghost jesus was actually washing the disciples feet everybody so the disciple was sucked into the feet washing as he was watching their feet they were talking about defeat jesus already left that dimension he was already in a different dimension and jesus taught them he said you are clean but not all so that he was probably talking about maybe somebody here didn't take a shower you see you are clean but not all jesus are you talking about somebody have their defeat or somebody didn't take a shower because we are washing our feet but jesus was already talking about the origin in faith washington [Music] said fall he did what he knew who should betray him therefore he said you are not all the children of god are clean children amen peter and all 11 disciples when god look at the gym they are clean not clean on the outside but cleaned by the insider yet jesus speak the word and say my word is truth he sanctified them jesus said i sanctify you by my word it's in john 17 17. so you thought everybody was clean but jesus came down again and said you are all clean there is one of you that is not clean yet i watch all of you but one of you even though i watch you one of you is not clean that clean is not in the physic that clean was of the insider of the origin i speak not of you all and i know whom i have chosen who chose judah jesus but that the scripture might be fulfilled he that it is prayed with me and had and has lift up his heel against me so he's talking about the disciple judah was among the disciples but he was the unclean one john 6 jesus answered them have i not chose you how many he didn't say 11. so to be called in the ministry it's not enough amen to be chosen by god it's not enough that's why preachers get in trouble preaching the gospel doesn't mean your origin is right so from today don't be stumble when a preacher does not leave the word of god don't be stumble if a preacher is still battling prejudice don't be stumble if a preacher is a big liar don't be stumble if a preacher is a big hypocrite until jesus said when you come to the pharisees you listen to what they preach but don't follow their example because year of your father did therefore [Music] judah judas unclean ever clear yet chosen by god yet preaching the gospel yet casting our devil my god jesus answered them saying have i not charged you 12. and one of you is a sinner how can a human being be a devil [Music] so judas was the devil that's why jesus said he is not clean make sense now because he was the devil in human flesh i'm gonna get to your angelic beings and you're gonna see who you were anybody clear one of you is the devil he speak of the spirit of judah he spoke of judah is carried the son of sermon for he he was that should betray him being one of the water but he was not clean because he was a demon by origin he was a son of perdition means he was a son of hell that's why he was not clean and the other was sons of weapon heaven that's why jesus said you're clean not they didn't make mistake not they took a shower or not [Music] anybody here john 17 while i was with them in the world i kept them in there the bible says in the book of revelation that there is a man that is coming on white horse right now in revelation 19 and his name was called the weapon i keep them in there so you don't keep yourself in the world that's why those that you taught were more spiritual than you left and you who thought of yourself being less spiritual you still remain in the world somebody is keeping you i kept them in that name those that that gave us me are kept i have kept and none of them is water but the son of who because he is unclean if he gave me somebody they're gonna i'm gonna keep them in the world and they're gonna be lost america let's continue with judah john 17 12 brother branham say while i was with them in the world i just read it i have kept them in that name those who that gave me i have kept and none of them is lost but the son of perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled brother branham explained he says now if language means anything at all we must admit that judas was chosen by jesus yet he was not because he was a devil judah was also given to jesus by the father let it be noted here that the choosing and the giving is the exact parallel as in the illustration of moses and who jacob and who for thou issue and pharaoh were both foreign they were predestinated what while the end of moses and jacob was due was glorification one vessel of mercy the other vessel of water [Music] for this cause i bound my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ of whom the whole family in heaven and of his work name who we okay this ministry that he gave them was actually the sharing of his own ministry with them so the ministry that judah received was but he is a devil trying to help you yes sir for he says in matthew 9 35 38 and jesus went about all cities and villages teaching in their synagogue and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every sickness and every disease among the people remember the same thing he told them right that's why he shared the part of the ministry anybody here but when he saw them melted he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd then say he unto his disciple they have a stool his plaintiffs but the laborers are few pray he therefore the lord of the harvest that he will send forth labor into his harvest so the part of the ministry that judas obtained is a correct ministry the birth of judah that judah obtained among the 12 and then lost was neither inferior to the ministry of the other eleven nor was he a devilish foreign ministry interjected among the ministries of the other judah said devil lost a god-given holy ghost ministry judah never lost the holy ghost judah lost their holy ghost ministry judah never lost the holy ghost he lost the ministry of the holy ghost hallelujah lost a god given holy ghost ministry and killed himself and went to his own place his name was even in there but his name was what blotted out ever clear notice judah spirit never got to pentecost you understand now he cannot receive the holy ghost anybody he never went up to receive the holy ghost he could not because he's unclean he's a devil the holy ghost cannot baptize a devil [Music] everybody clear but what did that judah spirit go forth he went for the bag of gold he loves money and still loves him if he goes about in the name of jesus doing mighty things and holding great meetings he still makes more money and buildings and education and everything with a material concept just watch the spirit that is upon them and don't be fooled judas was a judas went about one of the twelve and he did miracle too but he did not have the spirit of god as his own [Music] make sense he did have a ministry he never got to pentecost as he was not he was not a true child of god hallelujah the bible says for it is written in the book of psalms let what let what so among deaths one of them is judah let if judah is here therefore judah will be blocked to salvation therefore judah's name must be what [Music] that's why brother branham said he have his name in the book of life let his habitation be desolate let no man dwell therein and his bishopri let another take that he may take part of this ministry an apostleship from which judah by transgression did what that he might go to his own place let them preach salvation and deliverance through the power of god just like judah with a ministry imported by christ but because they are wrong seed origin consequently they have a wrong spirit motivating them what's wrong with their motives and the objective behind ministers [Music] religious oh my they outshine the electing every and what that's why they could do things more than you until you feel like you're not a christian hallelujah but it is the audition not of christ for he looks for big crowds big programs and straddling sons among them they preach the second coming of christ but deny the advent of the prophet messenger though in power and son and true revelation he eclipsed them all brother problem is beyond them ah yes this false spirit that in the last day is so close to the real can be distinguished only by it what it cannot remain in the word it's deviation from the and whenever it is caught [Music] in being entered it falls back on one argument not two we have already shown this to be false what is that argument we got the result don't we we have to be of god i pray for the sick they were healed you want to tell me god is now with me i cast out devils i was here you want to tell me god is now with me what do you do with the world because the devil cannot abide in the world oh i have a dream i saw this decent dream i don't care what your dreams say i don't care your revelation i don't care your sermon i want to see your life based by the word [Applause] what did the lord say what are you doing that's why jesus said marvel not on casting out devils but i want you to make sure your name is in the book if your name is in the book your behavior will show who you are check yourself examine yourself whether you are in the world in the faith ever here brother branham says this now i am sure that you have noticed that those whose name were in the book of life were a part of the religious order of that day that center around the true god and worship of him in other words if judah was in the book of life and his name was blotted out his habitation became jesuit if some other people have their name in the book of life what does it mean brother banham said to have the name in the book of life means whenever god is gonna do something religiously in a time you gonna be part of it but don't stop there you must make sure if your name will remain or your name will be blotted out you might be part of it but later on you're going to live hallelujah like judah that didn't go all the way all the way i'm going all the way see how judah was chosen of god he was instructed in truth they preached him everything they taught him the high heel they taught him the makeup they taught him the nails everything he shared the knowledge of the mysteries he had a ministry of power granted unto him and he healed the sick and cast out devil in jesus name not in the name of devils but when they showdown came he sought out for gold and political power he did not go up to pentecost to receive the spirit of god he was devoid of the spirit make no mistake about it spoken to him a person that is truly baptized brother michael by the holy ghost into the body of christ receiving the fullness of the spirit will be in the word [Music] who got the holy ghost then we gave so many people holy ghost he will be in the world all the way that is the evidence of being baptized with the judah fell multitude fell right there and when they fell they go on in that word their names are taken off the book of life everybody a true seed of god a correct origin from god will always remain in the world take john chapter 6. hallelujah take john chapter 6. are you there let's look at someone verse 6 if you're there you can say amen many therefore of his what a few people you're still looking at open your scripture many therefore of his disciples when they had heard this say 60 john 6 60. are you there many therefore of his work not his enemy those that were in the message of the hour many therefore of his disciple when they have heard this say this is a a hard saying who can in other words who can understand this what he's preaching is too difficult do you think i preached something hard christ preached more harder than me and you pretend you can stand for jesus christ amen brother brother say he never even explain it [Music] here the holy spirit is coming with grace to unfold it to you here no explanation take it or not america verse 6 61 when jesus knew in himself that his disciple murmured at it they begin to grumble he's preaching stuff we don't understand he said to them does this offend you [Music] preaching is offending someone what is your origin [Music] amen what if you see in other words he makes another one complicated again instead of oh is it difficult for you let me explain it to you no let me make it harder again this is christ not brother stephen jesus himself what if you see you shall see the son of man ascending up where he was before it is the spirit that quickens the flesh prophet nothing the word that i speak to you their spirit and their water as hard as my messages as difficult as my message is to understand yet what seems to be hard and difficult is spirit and its life if it's spirit in its life what is your responsibility just say amen are you there but the reason why you remembering but there are some of you some of his disciples there are some of you that believe they are following jesus they are called the disciple of jesus but they never believe jesus but they are going with jesus everywhere he's going but they were never convinced of what they are following never believe for jesus knew from the word you see the god of the beginning he knew from the beginning who they were that believed and who should two groups that believe not many betray him judah anybody verse 65 and he said therefore he said therefore said that to you that no man can come to me except you were given to me of my water jesus is now teaching them the origin you crumbling at the message you say it's complicated you say you don't understand i know where it's coming from some of you already did not believe it is not because i preach you this that is hard from the beginning you already struggle with it amen i know you who are not believing everybody everybody understand but one thing that i know if you come to me you must be send by the father you must be from the correct origin but some of you got mixed into it i understand let me help you up verse 66 john 6 66 6 6 6 john 6 66 the mark of the beast from that time many of his what all know many of the sinners brother you thought he was only judah many of his disciple the people that were in the message went and walked so they were walking before what no more with him watch then say jesus to the twelve jesus never followed them and said they left the church let me go see them brother what's going on what is hard on my sermon that you don't understand that i can help you up is there anything wrong i did nobody so what is wrong brother come on now he didn't say that then say jesus to the twelve will you also help in other words what are you wearing follow them not please you are start with you don't leave me look at everybody's forsaking me please stay with me no go oh you're sitting here why are you not going [Music] are you there why are you not leaving go ahead and leave go do what everybody else did leave the church did jesus put ropes on them [Music] did jesus say no please i'm gonna be paying you salary so you stay here [Music] go ahead go you ready oh i wanna have an empty church go the origin you want to see the origin you want to see the origin verse 68 dan simon peter a man that denied him three times [Music] a man that one time was filled with the devil until jesus turn around and say get thee behind me satan talking to peter [Music] a man that is ready to fight his temper is always up you touch jesus i cut you off a man that seemed to be bad a jacob are you there so bad until satan go and pleaded with god he said give me peter so i can shift him it's in the book of luke i'm going to read it to you amen damn without understanding like the other disciple he looked his origin spoke yes yes what did his origin speak then someone peterson lord to whom shall we go [Music] so you are chasing me you don't understand where am i gonna go you forgot me i'm not going nowhere i'm sticking with you to whom shall we go you have the words of water did peter had the holy spirit amen [Music] was peter baptized with the holy ghost yet the holy ghost is just a confirmation just putting a seal that you are mine until the day of i meet you in the air he said you have word of eternal life and we believe in our water that you are that the son of water even though god pushing everybody out he could not push other out don't he slay me yet i do not i'm not running away we're not going out whoever needs to go out can go out not me because the true seed will go with the word all the way take a look chapter uh luke chapter 22 and i'm gonna head quickly
