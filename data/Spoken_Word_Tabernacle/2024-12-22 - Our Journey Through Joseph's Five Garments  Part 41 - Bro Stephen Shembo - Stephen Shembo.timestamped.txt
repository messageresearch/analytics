[55:56] answer sir Lord's willing uh brother
[55:58] Glenn is working on the venue so we'll
[56:00] let you know in the future for recap
[56:03] next week service on Tuesday 7:30 here
[56:07] December 31st Tuesday New Year's Eve
[56:11] service 8 p.m. on February 1st young men
[56:15] February 22nd young sisters March 22nd
[56:19] married C of meeting part five are we
[56:24] clear praise God there was a question
[56:28] that was placed in the question box and
[56:30] I miss it and it was about the young
[56:34] sister's meeting so I thought about
[56:38] answering that because we took courtship
[56:40] one we took courtship two and then we
[56:42] finished now we're getting prepared for
[56:44] the engagement but somebody put a
[56:46] question and I miss it so I didn't get
[56:48] it but I thought it's good for me to
[56:50] answer that question from the pulpit so
[56:53] that the parent knows where we stand
[56:56] standing because when I give instruction
[56:59] according to the prophet and the word if
[57:01] you are going different than your
[57:03] children you getting you are confusing
[57:06] them and it create tension at home we
[57:08] don't want tension and the question was
[57:11] I believe it's a young sister she put a
[57:13] question she say a young man approach
[57:17] her and ask for her
[57:20] number so that he will know her
[57:25] better should I give the number or
[57:29] not according to what we taught you amen
[57:34] do not give the
[57:38] number can you say amen amen H don't
[57:41] give the number to that young man that
[57:45] young man need to be bold enough amen
[57:49] come
[57:50] on are we together to go see your parent
[57:55] amen come ony come on parent can you say
[58:00] Amen that young man need to come home
[58:03] and see your father and your mother and
[58:06] talk to them and ask permission there
[58:10] first before he start talking to you are
[58:15] we together are we together so no
[58:18] communication should exist without the
[58:22] parent being
[58:24] aare and the parent will have to monitor
[58:28] you both of you during your courtship
[58:32] during your engagement until you get
[58:37] married and the pastor should be aware
[58:40] of that so I can send my
[58:44] drones are we together and investigate
[58:47] that man very well which church he's
[58:50] coming through which Ministry has he
[58:52] been under what kind of parent did he
[58:55] live with so I will know clearly where
[58:58] you going because you are my
[59:01] [Applause]
[59:06] children are we together are we together
[59:10] in one sense I will blame the pulpit
[59:13] amen because brother Bram say it's
[59:15] Pulpit
[59:17] delinquency we didn't take time to teach
[59:19] the young people what they are supposed
[59:22] to do we bind on them on the Holy Ghost
[59:25] the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost the Holy
[59:27] Ghost and we left all the other aspect
[59:29] of life amen amen so sometime do not be
[59:35] too hard on the young
[59:37] man I'm going to go slowly my friend
[59:40] sometime don't be rude toward the young
[59:43] man the young man might not have the
[59:46] same teaching that you have here are we
[59:50] together but I'm going to hold you
[59:53] responsible if you don't stand on your
[59:56] ground in other word if the young man
[59:59] comes do you follow me this is the best
[1:00:03] that he knows sometime he doesn't mean
[1:00:06] bad this is what he knows give me your
[1:00:09] number so it's your responsibility young
[1:00:12] sister to recalibrate the young man I

[1:00:37] will advise you to talk to my parent
[1:00:40] come and talk to my parent and then you

[1:00:53] Christian a true young man he will
[1:00:56] humble himself to the word are we

[1:33:22] offering of Israel
[1:33:24] as a
[1:33:25] congregation so when it come to the case
[1:33:28] of ignorance both the Brad amen and
[1:33:35] Israel get the same sin offering which
[1:33:38] is a
[1:33:41] bulock or a
[1:33:43] c amen so the one who changes
[1:33:48] atonement is not the Brad the Brad
[1:33:52] atonement remain the same
[1:33:55] are we together but the one that changes
[1:33:57] the atonement is
[1:34:00] Israel if the sin of ignorance is placed
[1:34:04] on Israel and somebody comes and make
[1:34:07] Israel know their sin then Israel will
[1:34:12] move are we together from an old
[1:34:17] atonement follow me my friend of a
[1:34:21] goat Amen in to a new
[1:34:25] atonement are we together of a new
[1:34:30] atonement of a calf but what is new for
[1:34:35] Israel it's old for the
[1:34:39] Brad amen it is an atonement that always
[1:34:43] has been there for the Brad but it was
[1:34:45] never expressed to
[1:34:48] Israel are we together and when this
[1:34:51] atonement of Cal was given
[1:34:54] unto the bride or the priesthood we
[1:34:57] found out that the sin of Aaron amen was
[1:35:01] a golden calf that's right in other
[1:35:04] words God
[1:35:05] anticipated on the sin of Aaron before
[1:35:10] Aaron even
[1:35:12] sin are we together because the golden
[1:35:15] because the calf offering was given to
[1:35:18] Aaron before he produced the calf so God
[1:35:22] pre L already worked and provided the
[1:35:27] sacrifice before sin was
[1:35:31] expressed are we together and we found
[1:35:34] out that in our life before we were
[1:35:38] born because God say in Roman that I
[1:35:42] love
[1:35:44] Jacob and I hated es God loved Jacob
[1:35:49] before Jacob was born amen the Bible say
[1:35:52] before the children does anything good
[1:35:55] or bad God already spoke I love Jacob am
[1:35:59] in other word god already have a
[1:36:01] sacrifice for Jacob God knew Jacob will
[1:36:05] lie he knew Jacob is going to teach Che
[1:36:10] and he knew the message Jacob is going
[1:36:12] to do so God already provided a
[1:36:15] sacrifice so your sacrifice came before
[1:36:21] you are we together am are we together
[1:36:25] are we together that's why the Bible say
[1:36:27] the lamb was slain before the foundation
[1:36:33] of the world are we together am before
[1:36:36] you come in your natural realm to
[1:36:39] experience sin and fall the lamb was
[1:36:42] already slain that's why God say I say
[1:36:47] hallelujah that you are God in other
[1:36:50] words I already provided your in your
[1:36:55] protection I already have the
[1:36:57] antidot I already have the solution to
[1:37:00] your fa before you even fall amen that's
[1:37:04] why I say you are God in other words you
[1:37:07] will never lose your Divine
[1:37:11] position no matter how deep the devil
[1:37:14] can get you he won't change God
[1:37:18] declaration he won't change God's
[1:37:20] statement for you what God Said you
[1:37:23] going to be you will be
[1:37:25] [Applause]
[1:37:28] it are we together this is why brother
[1:37:32] Bram came up with statement and saying
[1:37:34] if the Lord send me to
[1:37:38] Hell brother Bram say that he say I will
[1:37:41] go to hell loving
[1:37:43] [Applause]
[1:37:45] him didn't say I won't go he say I will
[1:37:48] go to hell but I will still love him are
[1:37:51] we together how can that love enter in
[1:37:56] hell are we together because God sent
[1:38:00] Jesus himself in
[1:38:04] hell are we together God took Jesus and
[1:38:08] sent him to hell did Jesus remain in
[1:38:11] hell so there is no place you can enter
[1:38:14] that you cannot be rescued amen you are
[1:38:18] redeemable amen God loves you with a
[1:38:22] system of redeem
[1:38:24] [Applause]

[2:08:15] me read this my
[2:08:17] friend my friend I don't know if it
[2:08:19] started here it's when I pulled C that's
[2:08:22] when he went out in the message I'm
[2:08:23] going to give you the reference because
[2:08:25] I don't have it on a computer in the
[2:08:27] message the results of
[2:08:29] decision preaching
[2:08:32] 1955 October the 8th paragraph 12 I'm
[2:08:36] going to repeat it again the result of
[2:08:39] decision preaching
[2:08:41] 1955 October the8th paragraph 12 the
[2:08:45] Bible says brother Bram say you have
[2:08:48] fine ministers all through here who are
[2:08:52] preacher they can preach the gospel to
[2:08:55] you just going back but just going back
[2:09:00] as he was like a Sunday school lesson
[2:09:03] and I am a
[2:09:06] prospector brother Bram is calling
[2:09:09] himself a prospector follow me my friend
[2:09:12] he say you didn't know that did you he
[2:09:16] said yeah I go down in the Bible and dig
[2:09:23] up these
[2:09:26] gems let me make sure because you won't
[2:09:28] say you didn't get my accent these gems
[2:09:32] amen and dig up these gems and clean
[2:09:36] them off a little you know look at them
[2:09:39] and I like to dig in the book of Exodus
[2:09:43] amen because you find plenty game in
[2:09:48] there
[2:09:50] amen amen
[2:09:51] and if you happen to look every one of
[2:09:55] them was cheap off of the Lord
[2:09:59] Jesus in other word brother Bram say
[2:10:01] when I when I dig dig dig when I pull
[2:10:04] back I see Christ when I pull back I see
[2:10:07] Christ when I pull back I see Christ
[2:10:10] that's why brother Bram say if you read
[2:10:12] the Bible and you don't see Christ in
[2:10:15] every scripture you read the Bible wrong
[2:10:18] you must see Jesus Christ completely
[2:10:21] because Jesus is the whole revelation of
[2:10:24] God are we together remember when he dig
[2:10:28] he sees who when he dig he sees who
[2:10:31] Christ so Christ is in many
[2:10:36] places yet it one
[2:10:40] Christ no problem my friend in the
[2:10:43] message perfect Faith preaching
[2:10:46] 1963 in uh August the 25th in the
[2:10:49] evening paragraph 32 brother brandham
[2:10:53] say now these are real deep
[2:10:59] lessons these are
[2:11:02] deep amen they are deep
[2:11:07] lessons amen am he says and I shall
[2:11:12] catch I shall catch the top of it follow
[2:11:17] me my
[2:11:19] friend then you dig down in
[2:11:22] [Applause]
[2:11:25] it I wish this projector was working my
[2:11:28] friend I wish this projector was working
[2:11:32] amen this is the problem with minister
[2:11:34] in the
[2:11:36] message let me read it again brother
[2:11:38] Bram say in paragraph 32 now these are
[2:11:43] real deep
[2:11:45] lessons and I brother Bram will catch
[2:11:49] the top of it right are we together then
[2:11:54] you dig down in
[2:11:59] it that's why brother Bram could not
[2:12:02] preach every verse in the Bible what
[2:12:05] brother Bram did he opened the lead for
[2:12:11] us are we together when brother Bram
[2:12:14] opened the lead it is US minister to get
[2:12:18] inside and begin to dig
[2:12:21] [Applause]
[2:12:26] this message is not
[2:12:28] superficial this message was given to be
[2:12:35] digging we are repeating the prophet
[2:12:38] repeating the tap by digging into the
[2:12:44] tap if not your church won't be
[2:12:48] stable it will be an evangelic church
[2:12:52] but it's not really seated founded on
[2:12:55] the solid
[2:12:56] foundation that's right are we together
[2:13:00] are we together are we together so will
[2:13:04] Marion Bram this is why when we go to
[2:13:06] mered Caple meeting your mind is blown
[2:13:09] because when you read brother Bram you T
[2:13:11] something when we read in a in in a in a
[2:13:15] married couple with you you begin to see
[2:13:17] something else because brother Bram only
[2:13:19] open the lead and all I needed was
[2:13:22] somebody to open the lead once you open
[2:13:25] and the lead that's say then it's my
[2:13:29] [Applause]
[2:13:30] [Music]
[2:13:32] responsibility listen to me very
[2:13:35] carefully if this church is
[2:13:37] locked is sealed you need a code to get
[2:13:40] in you call Brother set you say brother
[2:13:43] set you the truste do you have the code
[2:13:47] and brother set give you the code are
[2:13:49] you it together and then you go you
[2:13:51] punch the code and you open the door and
[2:13:53] you stand right there you will not know
[2:13:56] what is in this
[2:13:57] [Music]
[2:13:57] [Applause]
[2:14:03] church all you will do is just explain
[2:14:06] us the door the door look beautiful and
[2:14:11] then the window look beautiful and then
[2:14:13] the color look beautiful this is what we
[2:14:16] have been doing that's not what the
[2:14:19] message came from message open the lead
[2:14:22] of the Bible hallu so that when you read
[2:14:26] the prodal song you need to enter in the
[2:14:29] prodal S and begin to enter in the
[2:14:32] bathroom and you enter in the pastor's
[2:14:35] office and you enter in the S booth and
[2:14:38] you go to the nursery and you begin to
[2:14:40] know the structure of the

[2:32:24] was a kid and the angel of the Lord told
[2:32:27] Gideon take that offering and put it on
[2:32:30] the rock you remember that Sunday you
[2:32:33] remember that Sunday he said put that on
[2:32:35] the Rock Amen and Gideon took the
[2:32:39] offering it is so deep here but I cannot
[2:32:42] get it he say Gideon get the kid or the

[2:32:49] Amen
[2:32:50] with un Le
[2:32:52] cake we will get into this next Sunday
[2:32:56] because I can't get into all of these as
[2:32:58] Sy he get the kid or the goat and Gideon

[2:33:47] one and then consume the broth and
[2:33:50] consume the cake and the angel of the
[2:33:52] Lord
[2:33:53] disappear so the angel of the Lord
[2:33:57] sanction that offering right he was okay
[2:34:02] with that offering but if he's okay in
[2:34:06] the same night this is what the Bible
[2:34:09] says in the same night God comes again
[2:34:13] the angel come again and say
[2:34:16] Gideon go get another offering and built
[2:34:21] an
[2:34:23] altar do you follow me yes sir and put

[2:34:48] stop there
[2:34:50] he moved Gideon from the old atonement

[2:34:56] one are we together because the one who
[2:34:59] said to offer a kid was God right are we
[2:35:03] together but the time came that the
[2:35:06] offering has to be
[2:35:08] changed so you got to move toward the
[2:35:11] new
[2:35:12] offering what are you trying to say this
[2:35:15] is why brother Bram could not deny
[2:35:18] Luther
[2:35:19] [Applause]
[2:35:22] are we together FL attend and prepare
[2:35:24] for for landing this is why brother
[2:35:27] brother could not deny
[2:35:29] wle because he was God at that time he
[2:35:34] sanctioned them he he acknowledged them
[2:35:37] he recognized them he recognized Wesley
[2:35:41] he recognized Pentecost but that's not
[2:35:44] our
[2:35:45] offering that is not our message that's
[2:35:49] why the people that have a problem when
[2:35:51] brother Bram is coding this and this and
[2:35:54] this and this and say what is you are a
[2:35:56] Smith and everything everything that was
[2:35:59] God before even in portion brother Bram
[2:36:03] have to say Amen to that but that is not
[2:36:06] our day
[2:36:07] message we got to move from Luther from
