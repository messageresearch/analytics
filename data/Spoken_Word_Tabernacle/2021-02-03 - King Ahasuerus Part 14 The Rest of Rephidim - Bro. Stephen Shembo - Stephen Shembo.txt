the name of the lord if you want to go where he wants you to be you need to make sure you drunk water from referendum because those that are the children of god they are led by the spirit of god in other words we want to be led by the spirit amen good to see everybody tonight i hope you're not tired from work if you are may the holy spirit give you strength because he is el shaddai let's go to a scripture i don't know if you hook it appreciate you making your way on wednesday it is a great sacrifice except especially nowadays and the lord will be mindful to you for everything you're doing genesis chapter 26 we read it on sunday i'm going to read one verse there as we continue on our subject praise the lord brother robert already mentioned that just continue to remember brother mike holloway we are in communication with him so that the lord can intervene and do a miracle amen he is the lord that can give us a new heart also remember sister benita some of you know her here she lost her aunt in charlotte so just continue to remember the family in prayer so that the lord can comfort because he is the comforter amen on sunday for those that are going to be streaming later on we will have our church vote for the officer so we will appreciate if you dare and you can do it in person but if for some reason you're not there make sure you check on the mass text message it's going to give you instruction about how to vote if you are a member of this church or you consider this church to be your home church you will be given instruction how to vote any have to be done during the service we cannot get your ballot four hours later or in the evening and you say you want to vote that won't happen amen if you want to do it you stay streaming online stay online we do it and our appointed trustees and deacon will no longer be appointed they're going to be voted in amen blessed be the name of the lord let's go to genesis chapter 26 if you're there you can say amen yeah we need some fire tonight don't worry we'll get there on sunday we went through a lot of scripture and dig deep on the redemption of the soul and having the rest tell you what the devil was really mad you should be on monday with me but that's a good sand though so i know you really struck home amen if you shoot in a dark and nothing say ouch so if you did you miss it when i hear ouch then i know really where that was a bull's-eye genesis chapter 26 verse 22 and here we move from there brother mike uh david give me more and he removed from there and dug another well that's the third one which we saw on sunday was the baptism of the holy ghost amen and for day for and for that destroy of note in other words there was no fight no struggle over there once you get the holy ghost there is no more fighting amen no more fighting with yourself there is a different fight that you get in and he called the name of it ryoboth and he said for now the lord has made room for us that was referred them there is a lot of rest not a resting place for one person but for many people everybody clear so there is room for everybody for now the lord has made room for us and we shall be fruitful in the land you might be seated so when they reached the third step here which is real about which gave them more room that was the place that jacob explained or expressed that they're going to be fruitful now in the land in other words once you reach the third one once you get or you enter into the rest then you can begin to produce fruit or you can become fruitful everybody clear so far let's go to john chapter 15. john chapter 15 verse 1. if you dare you can say amen jesus says that i am the true vine and my father is the husbandman in other words the fine dresser every branch in me so that branch must be in christ you cannot be outside and expect to be fruitful amen to be fruitful you need to be connected or grounded in christ you need to drink from the water from the rock that was stricken by the prophet everybody clear every branch in me that bear not fruit again we're talking about fruit okay every branch in meat that bear not fruit he takes it away and every branch that bears fruit he purges it that he may bring forth more fruit everybody clear verse 3 now you are clean through the word which i have spoken to you so right here you can see that sanctification comes by the word anybody clear if you're a little sleepy just shake your hand wake up amen verse 4 a body in me and i in you in other words remain there as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can you expect except you abide in me so there is no way you can bear fruit if you are not grounded in christ amen you must reach the third well of jacob at that point you become fruitful in the land verse 6 verse 5 i am divine you are the branches he that abides in me and i in him the same brings forth much fruit for we that mean you can do what so you must be connected to christ without christ you can do nothing amen verse six if a man abide not in me he is cut he's cut forth as a branch and he's withered and men gather them and cuts them into the fire and they are burned if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you verse 8 herein is my father glorify or honor that you bear much water so that you shall be my disciple if you are a true disciple you must manifest the fruit of god if there is no fruit in your life you need to stop your car and go back to the shop anybody clear so something is wrong job to verse 16 you have not chosen me that's what i like about it your car is neutral you have not chosen me but i have chosen you whether you like it or not you have been chosen by god amen and oh damn you or predestinated you or i have appointed you and ordain you that you should go and bring forth water so those fruit you don't have to manufacture them you just need to be connected to christ and automatically by predestination you're going to begin to bring the fruit that god ordained you to bring forth amen and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should what remain it's eternal that whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name he may give it to you over there he says that his word have to abide in you amen once his word abiding you then you can ask and here he says that if you are fruitful you can ask in other words to get to that point you need the holy spirit you need the rest of god let's go to romans 7 then we're going to pray amen hallelujah romans 7 verse 2. we gave you the scripture a lot of time if somebody is not receiving text message and need to vote you need to contact me or contact one of the deacon or the trustees so we make sure we clear that up we don't want anybody feel like they were left behind and they were not given opportunity to speak because you speak by your vote romans 7 verse 2 for the woman which have a husband is bound by the lord to her husband so long as he lives but if the husband be dead she is losed from the law of her husband that's the reason why david have to kill uriah verse three so then if while her husband leaves she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead that first nature she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress does she be married to another one so to be married with christ your first husband must die amen verse 4 wherefore my brethren you also are become dead to the law by the body of christ by being identified in the body of christ you become dead to the lord amen that you should be married to another one to a new husband even to him that's the husband even to him who raised from the dead and the husband that rose from the dead his name is who okay jesus that we should bring forth water unto her if you're not married with him there is no way you can bring fruit anybody clear verse 5 for when we were in the flesh in other words living in a flesh because paul was still in the flesh when we were in the flesh the motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit to die to death so they are fruit and unto life and fruit unto death when we were married with our first husband which is the world we were bringing fruit unto death things that were not good we were cussing lying cheating stealing doing all those kind of stuff but once you are married with christ you must bring a different kind of fruit in other words when you call yourself christian we are expecting something different than what you had before you cannot be a christian and continue to lie you cannot be a christian and continue to cheat a christian everything is dead and you become a new creation ever clear let's pray then heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace you love your mercy father and for everything you have been doing for us lord thank you for giving us another opportunity to gather together in your house around the revealed word of the hour lord this is a mid-week service where your children have been at work and from work they made their way all the way lord father to this house lord our body are tired but you know lord that our spirit are still yearning to hear from the lord father you the god that gives strength you are else shadow lord father may you give strength and energy to your children lord may you remove every spirit of tiredness lord every spirit lord of sleepiness lord may you observe an anointing tonight lord that can lord father geared our mind our heart has so lord to be centered into the word of life lord that can produce fruit lord father we committed unto the hand be the alpha and the omega the beginning and the end of the service lord as we ask it in the name that is most powerful name which is the name of jesus christ amen god bless you you already been seated we are continuing for where we left on on sunday on king ahazares three fists and esther's two banquet we already seen the first fist the second the turn we finished the first banquet this is in preparation to the second banquet because if we enter there without these elements it's going to be difficult for you to catch what is hidden in symbol in the scripture because the bible is written in mysteries on sunday we stop in referendum and we say that referendum means rest or resting place and there were not only one rest but there were many rest or many resting places which spoke about rio above which is a place where there is room for everybody because the promise of the holy spirit is not only for one person amen he came in jordan but jesus says that it is expedient it is better for me to go because if i don't go there is no way that i can send the holy spirit amen and when peter spoke in the day of pentecost he says that the promise is unto you to your children and as many as the lord your god shall call so until the lord shut the way i mean the door like he did the ark of noah there is still room for everybody and that everybody means the predestinated seed of god everybody clear so far now when we spoke in referendum moses went to horrible when he went to all to horeb he struck the rock and when the rock was squeaking we know that that rock spoke about christ we gave you the scripture on sunday water came out of that water and brother branham explained to us that the water was the holy spirit which was quenching the thirst of the soul because david have two tests to thirst he says that my soul was testing after the living god and we also demonstrated to you that not only was the soul testing but the body also was testing for their living god so there was a test for the soul and it turns for the body there is a redemption for the soul and there is also a redemption for your body that's the reason why even though you have the holy spirit you are subject to sickness you are subject to pain you are subject to aging you are subject to many different temptations because your body is not redeemed yet everybody clear no problem so the holy spirit or the drinking of the water in referendum deal with the inner man which is the soul and complete the redemption of the body or the redemption or the redemption of the soul or the redemption of the inner man the first part is completely done but it is not finished you still have one more step to go anybody clear praise the name of the lord now how this does this process of the holy spirit get into you amen we spoke about we need to drink water from refuge we understand that we need to drink that spiritual water so that we can receive rest for our soul so how does that rest happen you ready let's go to ephesians chapter one now we are moving ephesians chapter one you really need your bible you need the scripture ephesians chapter 1 verse 13 we preach you need the holy ghost you need the word ghost you need the holy ghost how does it happen you need the holy ghost you need the holy ghost you need the holy ghost how do we get the holy ghost amen young people you need the holy ghost how do you get the holy ghost ephesians chapter 1 verse 13 if you dare you can say amen in whom let's go to verse 12 so you get the background that we should be to the praise of his glory everybody get me pretty good clear honestly okay that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in who so we are talking about christ anybody clear that rock that was moving that living rock amen in whom in christ in whom you also did what so the first thing there is a trust into christ everybody clear we are going deeply here come on after that you heard the word of water so number one when we are talking about the holy spirit you must first hear the word of truth clear and when you hear that word of truth you must trust in that word everybody clear i'm giving you the bible prescription this is before the door of the gentile closed in whom you also trusted kama after that you heard the word of truth what is the word of truth comer the gospel of your salvation so this word is the gospel and this gospel is meant for your salvation are you following me praise the name of the lord in whom also the same man christ after that you what so we are talking not only a trust in god but this choice goes deeper to the point that you must believe amen praise the name of the lord come on you are what with the holy ghost of what so there is a promise of the holy spirit amen that promise must be preached unto you amen we must present unto you the plan of god or the purpose of god for your life god does not want you to work for christianity god does not want you to labor for your christian life god doesn't want you to struggle to be able to live a christian life god have a remedy for you god have an answer for you and the answer somebody must present you the promise and that promise is for everybody that promise is in referendum that promise spoke about robot there is room for everybody but when the promise comes it comes in the form of the word of the truth which is the gospel of your salvation and once the word is preached unto you your responsibility is number one you must trust into christ are you following me then you must believe the world amen once you believe that word according to paul then you gonna be what still with the holy spirit amen if they preach the word and you are not sealed so something is wrong in this process if the car doesn't crack there is something missing somewhere there is a glitch somewhere either you heard the word intellectually but you never believe or trusted in that world and if you don't believe you can never be sealed because the ceiling is the recognition of your faith abraham believe god amen amen god spoke to abraham then abraham believed god and it was what imputed unto him for what then they gave them the seal of what see concession is that clear from the bible if you miss the holy ghost it's going to be on you amen how do we get the holy ghost how do we receive this rest go to james chapter 1. hallelujah we're going to deal with this redemption then we go to the body and we enter your second banquet because there there are symbols the king is mad the king getting and the king get out and they can come and hang a man there's a lot of stuff there you need to be prepared so once we begin to open those symbols it click like we get it james chapter 1 verse 8 if you dare you can say amen hallelujah i'm trying to get it here i hope i wrote it right give me a minute and i'm going to try to find it pretty good chapter 1 verse 20 one i hope i wrote this correctly james let's go to verse seven or six actually if you're there you can say amen but let him ask in what you see that nothing weathering for he the weather is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed for let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the lord anybody clear praise the name of the lord job to verse 18 17 actually every good gift and every perfect gift is from water ever clear you shall receive the gift of the holy spirit it's a perfect gift it's a good gift it is a gift that brings you rest everybody clear every good gift every good gift and every prophet gift is from above and comes down from the father of lights plural with whom is no variableness need a shadow of what turning verse 18 of his own water everybody clear of his own will father he has with water are you looking in that of his own will the will of the father he works everything according to his own will of his own will further he in other words he buffs us everybody clear father he has with the word of what so our birth depend on the word of what everybody clear here that's why paul said that first you heard the word of truth because you are giving birth by the word amen but that word is not the letter it is a living word that is preached unto you everybody clear verse 18 of his own will father he has with the word of truth that we should be the kind of first fruit of his what creature ever clear so james is again insisting to us here that when we get birthed by the father we our birth comes from the word of truth which we know it's the gospel of our salvation everybody clear praise the name of the lord let's go to first peter chapter one amen if you dare you can say amen peter follow james first peter chapter one verse two polish peter is talking to him first two can you read with me it's a chosen one not everybody elect anybody clear he left according to what the full knowledge of god the father amen predestination through sanctification of the water are taught to hear they say sanctification of the world amen let's continue through sanctification of the spirit to obedience and speaking of the blood of jesus christ grace to you and peace be what multiply drop to verse 22 now amen seeing you have seen you have purify your water so this is speaking about the purification of your soul in other words the redemption of your soul your soul you were born in sin shaping iniquity coming into the world speaking lies by nature you heard a wrong nature that's why david said my soul percept for the living god amen by the purifying of the soul everybody clear saying you have purify your soul in obeying water do you see right here amen so believe here goes with obedience if you don't have the holy ghost keep checking those amen saying you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit you see that to unfair love of the brethren genuine love see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently watch verse 23 being water born again not of what corruptible seed but of what incorruptible by there we are back again right here amen by the word of god but that word brother stephen just told you it is not a letter that word come out from the by the word of god which what so it's a living word it is a word that move it is a word that can talk it is a word that can jump it is a living being by the living word amen by the word of god which lives and what a bad for ever in other words by the logos clear that's why it is important to keep the word of god pure amen when we preach the word of god the word of god must be delivered the way it is intended by god to be delivered because the birth of god children depend on the word of god hallelujah romans 10 verse 17 so faith cometh by what we're talking about belief here right are we okay believe it you got stressed it goes deeper belief believe speaking about faith faith cometh by what hearing what we're back again at number one everybody clear faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of god so that's why the word delivering this pupil must be pure the bible says brother branham says if you mix it with something you're gonna cause a mess to the birth of the children of god why do until we see the holy ghost the way it's supposed to be amen second corinthians chapter 2 verse 17. for we are not as what there are many not few we are not as many which do what so there are many people that are corrupting the word of god and by corrupting the word of god you are closing or you are inhibiting the channel of birth by the holy ghost which corrupts the word of god but as of sincerity but as of god in the sight of god speak within christ ii corinthians chapter four verse two but have renounced to the hidden things of dishonesty not working in craftiness not handling the word of god what to deceive the people it will never bring birth but by manifestation of the truth commanding ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of god first thessalonians chapter 2 verse 3 for our exaltation was not of what nor uncleanness nor in what paul is insisting on the word because the word is very important if god say hey you must deliver a if god say be you must deliver be that's why we must repeat the prophet when i say when brother branham said come on we put camera people got where is he taking us to because of this amen i am not talking about the grammatic call error of the message or the grammar of the message i am talking about the message as christ the concept the channel of inspiration of brother problem repeat it the way he was given i'm not going to stand here and brother branham says 700 and i'm going to repeat 700. that is not what i'm saying amen when brother brother says 700 i'm not better and i'm gonna tell you seven thousand and he already corrected it amen but what i'm saying to stay with the word is to repeat it according to the aspiration he was given because if you change the inspiration you are affecting the birth of the children of god amen oh i have to give that rope so somebody can hang himself up i'm not going to listen to him anymore thank god amen in the message the greatest brother ever thought but your mind accepted in other words when we are preaching the word we showed you in the church where we came out that in our body we have the brain everybody following me and the brain who explained it to you we gave you code that is operated by the spirit anybody clear then we have the heart which is the occupancy of your soul amen if i stand on a pulpit here and i say blah blah blah blah blah blah it doesn't make sense you don't understand what i'm saying that's why paul said when i pray or what i see when i sing i can sing in tongues but i also have to sing with what understanding and paul said that if there is no translator don't say anything because we don't get the message the trumpet must give a clear sound so we know what to do whether it's for war or something else anybody following me so when we come and say but we don't know what you're talking about but when i say jesus love you the first line inside your body that grasp the word is your brain amen that's why we have translator so that we make sure what was preached in french is translated in english so that the one in english can catch it first by the brain you understanding what they are saying but it is not mad for the brain are you following me because the spirit have father let he have memory he has imagination he has conscience all of that faith ever clear so you don't send the word in the intent to hit the brain i'm gonna go slowly so it's gonna help you brother branham say your mind accepted that's where it comes from look he hit you i see what he's talking about amen he grasped it what is your man controlled by your spirit we are right here the wombo and your spirit catches the word of god anybody following me and that is the things that has got life in it it's the word remember there is life there it's living it is blinking like i'm here i'm here i'm here i'm coming amen it brings life east into you oh brother when that takes place when life comes down that channel into you the word of god is manifested in what so brother brother doesn't say that that word when it comes it stop here brother branham said you catch it here then you need to drop it all the way down there are you following me thank god if you abide in me am i you see now you see now a bad in you then ask what you will and it shall be done for you then what does that do from the middle of the heart right here anybody clear which is the we already explained to you from there god's fault feeding what every channel brother branham is saying when we preach the word it comes and you grasp it if you lay it here it's not gonna do anything are you following me if that word drop down here this channel is another mission amen whatever you put in the soul he puts it up amen they soul doesn't reason like the brain the soul just take what you gave to him and he just gave it to you amen i gave you the top of the boat i don't know how many remember that brother branham said usually there were somebody on top of the boat they were looking over there he says but the the the pallet of the boat was laying down here somewhere so he is the one that have the steering wheel and brother branham say this man right here is the soul amen and the man on the top right here is the spirit your spirit amen so when this dark man here give direction the one ander doesn't see what is going on over there he just goes according to the orders that are coming from above if the man on top of the boat say to the right he just take his boat and he moved to the right amen if he said to the left he moved to the left are you with me so the man right here only take instruction to what you give him that's why brother problem say many people have intellectual mind of faith when you ask him you say do you believe yes he's believing here but this man doesn't believe this man is afraid he's gonna die so no matter what you tell this man you can tell him we pray for you yes do you believe yes but down here he's scared the boat is going to ship to where you are scared everybody here and when brother branham saw that in john ryan he understood that john ryan is a catholic and he need to get grasp to something brother branham said don't worry if he said not to mention there is a way to go over that automation amen it is the power of the widow woman just keep begging the judge back the judge go over and over and over and over until the judge get tired and the judge will say you know what let me take care of this widow then she won't come again and disturb me that's why brother branham told john ryan he said go ahead and begin to confess because with your mouth you confess right here everybody there that's your mouth but with your heart you believe are you there so when you start confessing praise the lord i'm here praise the lord i'm healed praise the lord i'm healed praise the lord i'm here praise the lord i'm here automatically this person begin to get the message one two one two one two after one he wakes up he said oh okay you're talking about healing all okay let's go ahead and do the healing amen and that's the way the healing happened everybody clear so as long as this man doesn't get the message nothing is going to happen to you we can pray as we want it yes mommy understand what you're talking about no you have not understood yet once you understand if you drop in the heart that's say a man you can look at a woman you say oh she looks beautiful and nothing happened you are right here amen but let this man strike amen once you see the young sister and you're trying to get married and once this man goes boom that's it they can bring twenty thousand sister you don't see none of them this man have even the ability to blind you when you sleep he's the one that wake up he doesn't sleep he's your other medical the one that dreams is this one because this one comes with a headache he need to rest then this is the automation god put it there to preserve you that's why even in fire you can be sleepy and and they tell you in the morning do you know that we brought the fire and you did this you won't remember but that man was awake i'm not gonna get there i'm just gonna pull to a point everybody clear so far now brother branham said the spirit catches the word of god and then the things that is get life which is the word bring it unto you he says when that takes place when life come down down that channel into you the word of god is manifested into you i'm dropping down here he said then what does that do from the middle of the heart which is the soul from there god's forfeiting every channel the trouble of it is we are standing in here you following me now if you don't get this you won't understand what brother branham is saying you are standing here with a lot of doubt you follow now the doubt is here everybody here watch the next trying to accept what is out faith is here it's a discrepancy yes amen you are here with a loud adapter trying to accept what is out there you got to stop that and come down to that channel with a true water word of god and then it goes outward automatically there is an automation here once the word jump here automatically you get breath you don't live for yourself anymore somebody take over it is what is under the inside man of the boat everybody clear let's continue brother branham he said so many people not few lots of time has misconstrued the water handled the word wrong and i have been misunderstood by this by making altar calls i say i was not much on altico but when i didn't really like it why he didn't like it not meaning that you should not make an article but when i'm saying i'm not against it but i had a point by saying i don't want autism what is the point but somebody gets somebody by the arm say oh brother john you know what me and you being nervous all this time come up here at the altar do you see that get down what is he doing wish i had a black here you already got one amen i could show you what he's doing he's trying to work through his what are you following me through his soul on what which is a part of the spirit anybody there so when people say come your father is calling you your daddy is a pastor you need to come you saw he preaches you see what i'm saying you need to come your mother died all that are doing they are doing something wrong to you they are trying to bring the word of god and mix it with affection and send it to the soul using the wrong door amen he is trying to work through his soul on what in other words you bagging the wrong door amen that don't work that is not the avenue certainly it is not let's continue brother branham he said maybe he's working in the what uh memory do you remember how you fell do you remember how you went into a car wreck you need to give your life to christ amen through the senses of his soul memory is the sense of the spirit oh brother john you had a wonderful mother she died a long time ago maybe when your mother will see you in heaven she's gonna be happy then for the love of your mother not the love of god you're going to the altar you're not going to be born again a memory see you can't do that it's got to come down the line of water free moral urgency in other words we gotta bring the word straight to you and you have a right to either reject the word or accept it just like it is hallelujah you yourself let the word of god you don't come because your mother was a good woman you don't come because you are a good neighbor you come because that god caused you to come amen you cannot be saying that i did that because my mama wanted me to do that i went there because all the young people went there if i don't go there i'm gonna look bad don't come stay where you are we're trying to copy one another oh mom is there in church so i'm gonna act like a christian that's why you were there the way you are amen come because that god called you to come and accept him on the basis of what no feeling that word is what means what that's why paul would say we don't handle the word deceitfully amen you don't give the word by trying to please the people like if i said this they're gonna leave the church give it to them let them leave the church that word if you can get everything out of the way all conscious spirit all senses and just let the word coming that word will produce just what because the spoken word is the original everybody clear so far praise the name of the lord we continue death was not only the seed of a false vine but even in the true vine there was a creeping paralysis and impotence because they had already drifted from what an adulterated truth of the first few years after what and no true believer is any stronger and spiritually healthy and alive than his knowledge of and adherence to the what pure word praise the name of the lord amen in every age we have exactly the same pattern that is why the lord come through some god-given messenger in a certain area and then from that messenger there spread the light through the ministry of others who have been what faithfully taught but of course all those who go out with the message don't always learn how necessary it is to speak only what the messenger has what spoken don't change it the landing was not unto you right to the angel of ephesus the letter is to the angel to the messenger not you the messenger just take it and give it to you just read it the way he was given remember paul won the people to say only what he said first corinthians 14 37 if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that are right unto you are the commandments of the lord what can the word of god add from you oh came it on to you only they add here you see now and take away there and soon the message is no longer what and the word so the the fire of revolver is connected on the purity of the message how careful we must be to hear one voice for the spirit has by water which is the period the bible says brother branham says amen god gave the reverend of elijah an instruction there was famine in the land everybody was starving and god gave the reverend the ability to take bread and to bring it to elijah there was famine in the land there was no rain but the raven respected the brethren are you following me it could be a temptation for that raven to take that bread and eat it amen but the raven took the bread just as he was given and delivered the bread to elijah without tempering with the bread are you following me david took a letter and wrote the death of uriah and gave it to uriah and uriah took the letter of his death but never tempted to open the letter but to deliver the lady where he was and he produced exactly what the letters say must come to pass if uriah would have opened the letter and said let me change the word what david intended for him would never happen amen david said kill uriah you pick up the letter deliver to job job look and they kill you amen he ordered the heaven his servant you see those raven bless them bird his servant that keep the voice of what elijah alive during the time of his isolation from the so as servant of god we must always strive to keep the word of god pure why because the birth of the children of god depend on the purity of the word of god brother branham say there is something about a child of god that went once that when you once are born into the spirit of god receive the baptism of the holy spirit there is something about the person that can cease the enemy you can take a man when he's taking the scripture and reading the scripture and try to what inject something to that scripture that is contrary to the scripture a man that is filled with death can says that right quick that's why you need the holy ghost amen there is something out of the way when he gets into a place that leads a certain sense in there that it's done to protect you you must not you must never go for anything unless it's exactly the word of god you must stay right exactly with that word and now and we are secure with that says as long as we are in the holy spirit everybody clear so far many times we subject it we substitute so much instead of the word especially today we are substituting phenomenals we are substituting a lot of other things that should not be after all church each folder you understand now the preaching of the word testimonies are fine and different things we do is wonderful but we must give the word first place you understand now because it is further number one come on and for the people that has their holy spirit also those that are born again and those that are not born again the holy spirit feeds on the word of god he takes the word and places it into your and it makes you grow in strength good baba exposit i love to sit and hear a good bible teacher who can take the bible and lays it out then the spirit of kindness in and meekness with it where it takes root in good soft ground and goes to what growing everybody clear so far okay now you are you said a while ago you were a christian what made you a christian because god called you before the foundation of the world to be christian and you become a christian then you get saved filled with the holy ghost you got eternal life why did he give you the holy ghost as a seal of your word you remember abraham believed god everybody clear you had faith what so once the word of god comes number one you must believe that word just the way it's given now if you say well you said a while ago about billy graham and them hollering well how many want to accept christ as personal server has you up your hand is that all right certainly that's all right that's good but that is just the beginning then if you really believe you see now and really have what you open the door anybody clear believe it and accepted it in your heart and now what you see the problem in the message can i read it loud believe it and really accepted it and taught right you thought wrong hinder the birth misplace the word hinder the birth then the holy spirit will come as a circumcision that he give abraham after his faith er confirmation that your faith is okay i put my seal on it then you are born again everybody clear if that is it what about this faith you talking about brother stephen hebrew 3 you remember last sunday but with whom was he grieved 40 years was he not with them that had seen whose carcass fell in the wilderness and to whom sure he that you should not enter into his head but to them that believe you see that you see that now so we see that they could not enter in because of what the word was preached to them and they never receive it they never believe it for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them israel but the word i'm here number one the word preached did not work he didn't help them why not being mixed with what they never moved from the first one to the second part that's why you are not born again not mixed with faith in them that did what because faith cometh by what hearing what their but you don't stop at their hearing you must believe it and accepted it hallelujah for we which have believed do enter into what paul is telling you that we which heard the word and believe it we enter into what which is the ceiling of the holy ghost everything clear first corinthians 10 but with many of them god was not what we're talking about the word please hallelujah i read it to you that you must be taught right so let's go slowly amen please he didn't please god right yes with many of them not few god was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness the same one that were overthrown there how do you please god take hebrew chapter 11 hallelujah if you dare you can say amen it's impressive how time goes quicker hebrew chapter 11 if you dare you can say amen everybody there verse six everybody there but without what we back again on part two you see that you see this i imagine just letting the scripture speak to yourself but without faith it is what there is no way you can please god impossible i'm reading the bible without faith it is impossible to do what with many of them the lord was not what pleased to please god you must have what and with that faith it is impossible to please god that's why there is no holy ghost without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must what believe that he is and that he is the what rewarder of them that diligently seek what so when you are approaching god you must believe him and not only do you believe him you must believe that he is able to give you for that which you gonna ask him are you following me brother stephen if to please god it takes faith how do i get faith you ready praise the name of the lord go to galatian 3. hallelujah let me go back there galatians 3. if you dare you can say amen galatians 3 verse 2 amen all right verse two this only would i learn of you this is paul receive you the what we're talking about the holy spirit the rest of the soul receive you the spirit by the works of the law what you are doing come on oh by what do you see that again do you see that again the hearing of faith everybody clear job to verse five he therefore the minister to you the spirit in other words he that provides or gives you the holy ghost amen he therefore that provides or minister to you the spirit and work miracle among you so the giving of the holy ghost and the working of miracle how does it come you see that he therefore diminished to you the spirit and work miracle among you does it by the works of the law or thereby the hearing of what so both the holy spirit and the miracle comes from the hearing of faith everybody clear job to verse 8 and the scripture forcing that god will justify the hidden through what faith preached before the gospel to abraham saying in you shall all nation be what blessed job to verse 14 that the blessing of abraham might come on the gentile the hidden through jesus christ the atonement that we might receive the what promise of the spirit through what the only channel the blockage to part three is still the faith how do you get to that faith brother stephen take ephesians chapter two take ephesians chapter 2 if you're there you can say amen ephesians 2. what time is it yeah i gotta hurry up i'm not even in the third everybody there ephesians two verse one and you he has he what quickened somebody was dead you were made alive okay who were dead in trespasses and sin that was their first husband okay wearing in town past in your old life you walk according to the course of this world lust of the flesh lust of the eyes pride of life according to the prince of the power of the earth the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience under satan among whom also we all had our conversation we were part of that life in time past in the last of the flesh i already explained it to you fulfilling the desire of the flesh and of the what the brain and the body okay and where by what nature by birth you see children of wrath even as other in other words by birth we were not different than the men on the street okay but god who is reaching mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sin has quickened us together with whom so when jesus christ died on the cross and jesus rose again you were already represented then all you need to do by birth is to join back your representation in christ your work is already finished that's why when they present salvation they tell you to accept the work of the cross because you are identified there even when we were dead in sin has quickened us together with christ by what grace are you saved and has raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus why that in the urges to come in the future he must show the exceeding riches of his grace and his kindness to others through christ jesus in the future he's going to show you how much of a great love that was verse 8 for by grace are you saved through what oh my god i'm back again at number two anybody there you hear the word we insisting on unbelief and faith by grace are you served through what brother stephen how do we get this faith you ready now by faith through faith let me start again for by grace are you served through what and that not of yourself that faith it is not your faith it is not a fifth that you manufacture [Music] it is manifest that you produce in other words from start to finish you have nothing to do all you have to do is surrender to god isn't this life easy we want to complicate it faith are you saved through faith and that not of yourself it is what i'm giving you the scripture with that need to give it to you pure it is the gift of god do you pay for a gift come and buy without money without price because it's already been paying calvary it is the gift of god all you have to do is lord help man believe amen lord help man believe do you believe lord remove that unbelief let god bring his own faith and god always will believe his word and automatically you are born again do you have something to do no put your car in your chair not of yourself it is the gift of god verse 9 not of what you don't work for it i'm going to believe i'm going to believe oh that's where the pentecostal miss it i begin to feel so fire fire fire fire fire fire fight they come out living like devils and then finally you get discouraged it's like i did everything they told me to do and it's still not working amen not of work verse 9 lest any man should water god block it to himself so when you get to heaven nothing but amazing grace amen verse 10 for we are his what created in what to what you were already being ordained to bear fruit you are built built for that to good work which god has what before or them that we should do what so if you want to walk a christian life it's already been predestinated there is a program just receive the word of god the way he comes don't play game with the word if brother branham said this is wrong i'm just going to tell you exactly like brother brad i'm saying if i see a scripture i'm just going to give the scripture just like it is it might hurt you but it's gonna do you good because if we play with the prescription we have a trouble amen is it difficult to be born again take second timothy chapter one young people is it difficult to receive the holy ghost was paul praying for the holy ghost i'm just asking you when paul was going on the road to matthew to damascus was he saying that oh lord this is my time i feel the pool i need to get saved did paul do that he didn't even know they caught him off guard amen and he got there and and he became blind and he was praying to get his vision back and by getting his vision back he also give him the holy ghost because the one who give the spirit and work miracle give the spirit and work miracle by the hearing of faith and he told ananias he is a chosen vessel i already programmed him to be saved second timothy chapter one oh my god i need to hurry and stop somewhere then we're gonna pick up on sunday second timothy chapter one you there you can say amen everybody there knowing this hallelujah that the law is not made for the righteous man but for the loneliness and disobedience for the ungodly and for sinners for our holy and profane for murderers of fathers and murderers of mother for men slayer for warmonger for them that defile themselves with mankind for men stealers for liars for perjured person and if there be any other things that is contrary to sound doctrine anybody there everybody there i'm in first timothy oh i'm reading second timothy my god second timothy chapter one you there verse 9 you there let's go to wait be not you therefore ashamed of the testimony of our lord know of me his prisoner that's paul but be you partaker of the affliction of the gospel according to the power of god watch verse 9 who has what and what with holy not according to our you see that not according to our work but according to his own purpose and grace which was giving us in what before the world what the whole program of your salvation from start to finish was already programmed you don't have to work for it nothing go to titus chapter 3 titus chapter 3 verse 3. for we ourself if you dare you can say amen also we're sometime what foolish disobedient deceived serving diverse lust and pleasure living in malice and envy our first husband hateful and hating one another verse four but after that the kindness and love of god i will save you toward men did what it appeared to paul you clear now verse 5 we on tatters three first five not by what work of righteousness which we have there is nothing you have to do that's why brother branham said there is nothing you have to do to be saved amen not of work of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he did what served us by the washing of what and renewing off the world with that price without money let's head somewhere then we're going to stop once the holy ghost entered from the word of truth the gospel of your salvation you accept the word receive it accept it obey what the word say repent be baptized in the name of jesus christ go under the obedience of the word automatically he comes to you you are sealed with the holy spirit once the holy spirit seals you your first part of your job your redemption is finished because you are still until the day of your redemption that takes care of the enemy now when you get into that the second part is activated the first part was not a problem to you because you are a sinner on the inside you are black dark on the outside you are dark so everything you do is correct you're a sinner you drink you still you go home sleep wake up in the morning continue casting duels all kind of stuff amen so by the new birth you move from this stage which is sinner in a man sin assad sin you move into the second stage where the enemy now is right are you following me but the outside man is now still dark here nothing bothers you because he was your nature are you there the american was fine the devil was quiet because you were doing his work you were manifesting fruit unto death everything you were doing was a reflection of the kingdom of satan that's why satan was quiet keep drinking come still do whatever you do no problem but once you receive the word of god you believe into the gospel that is presented to you and you are born again that first nature the first husband died are you following me then you are married to the second husband as soon as you get married to the second husband this man is a different nature than this man war is declared amalek pool disorder makes sense now because we're going to deal with amalek in the book of esther are you following me now let's head home once watch that we talk to you about the engine chief since he got served received the holy spirit they asked him to say chief what's going on he said pretty good pretty bad what's going on there is a fight why there is two dogs we have a white dog and the dark dog the white dog is right here on the inside the black dog is still up there over here you have black dog black dog they all get along together on the east on the second stage you kick the inside black dog out and you put the white dog in then the two nature begin to fight i thought rest means no war it seems like i got in rest now i'm in trouble a paradox amen let me hit something here and then we go home go to uh roman chapter seven where is it yeah few minutes and i'm going to stop and we pick up on sunday if you dare you can say amen romans 7 verse 15 this is paul filled with the holy spirit job to verse 18 to save time for i know that in me that is in ma you see right here you see everybody clear now that is in my flesh dua no good thing he already started from your birth here no good thing no good thing any flesh for to will is present with me the good will is now on the inside it's present with me but how to perform that which is good i found not in other words paul is talking about the state of a restful christian he said i paul i'm born of the holy ghost i met christ i had experience they prayed for me i received the holy spirit but since i got the holy spirit like the indian chief i found myself in trouble amen now when i checked myself i found out that in me within the same framework of the church brother greg there's two spirits that are fighting amen on the inside i am trying to live for god but sometimes i feel like i need to bite his finger amen jump to verse 19 for the good that i would i do not but the evil which i would not that i do now if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin that dwells in what that sin is not in the soul of paul you got to say now don't say that i'm a christian i can sin no that sin is on the outside man amen job to verse uh job to verse 21 i found them a law that when i will do good evil is what you are going with that amalekite all the time you sleep with him you wake up with him we gotta see how we gonna destroy him amen amen verse 22 for a delight in the law of god after the word because the inner man have the holy ghost the holy ghost feeds on the word you see now let's go down to verse 23 but i see another law in my members that is doing what now america to begin his war you see now after you have drunk from the water of rephidim that's when amalek attacked you amen praise god now warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into what captivity to the law of sin which is in my in other words the sin that is in the body is trying to pull you back to the old life amen and then the new nature is trying to pull you back to be transformed into the image of god watch verse 24 oh what that time who shall what for the what now paul which were david walls paul begin to cry for the redemption of the body you see now paul said who can deliver me not from the inside man but from this my soul thirst after the living god my soul already satisfied resting now i got in trouble paul begin to groan like david now my body also lord is wretched everybody clear watch verse 8 chapter 8 verse 1 and we stop here there is therefore what call is telling you when you get that stage don't be condemning yourself don't be like uh since i'm a christian don't do that don't do that there is a way we're going to teach you now how to leave from there on amen because once the american comes you need to call joshua you don't do the fighting hallelujah you get into all but it's not your world it is the war of the white dogger just give the place to the white dog and let him handle the black dog all that you do continue to give the white dog more food the more food you give him the more he's slain verse 1 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in what who walk not after the but after the for the love the spirit of life in christ has made me free from the law of what if you found yourself under this pressure in life it's not a state of condemnation because on the inner man you are trying the best that you can to live for christ that's why he's an advocate so when you do something wrong just repent and go back in line and live joyfully don't repent and then you go down like this because once you repent he takes her put it on the sea of god forgetfulness even though you remember he doesn't remember you can remember all you want god does not remember therefore you are free from what condemnation it is not a life that puts you in sadness it is a joyful life because your faith rests death on christ let's stand [Music] if it's a life of condemnation why do we why are we christian because we're living more uh in wilderness and sadness than what we wear it seems like when we were in a nightclub we had fun and when you become a christian it becomes a problem like there is no fun no there is a true fan in christianity in a nightclub there was a perversion because when you were going home you are regretting on the life that you are living but you don't regret if you are born again amen the one who's born again is groaning that paul said we in this body we grown why are you groaning because you are pulling god to bring the second redemption amen so once you get the second redemption the devil will not have anything to do with you anymore the second redemption takes away sin all your sickness all your trouble all your heartache all your white hair forever to be younger we urging because of death and the devil bagged just that it's like a cocker bird the devil just heaven as you move out amen let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy and father for giving us an opportunity to lay around the lord these things father you prophet studied spoke that these things must be taught right lord all that we are doing is presenting the word as pure as we can to the best of our ability so that the holy spirit himself in your sovereignty you know who are your seed lord and you will quicken them father we thank you for unfolding these things to us where christianity is not a work it's not a labor it's not a forceful work that we have to do to please you lord but the only thing that we have to do in this life is just to put ourselves in the hand of the living god and surrender our life surrender our right surrender our ability surrender our body our soul our spirit and lord father give you the full authority to do that which you have predestinated to do in our life because the plans that you have for our life is a good cleanse lord it's a plan to give us a hope lord not the plans of destruction lord father we can see from the time we were born from the many different ways that we grew up in our life and where we are today lord we can truly testify that for sure the hand of the lord is in my life i can see from where i started where i am i am not the same man i was i am not the man i wanted to be but for sure i'm going somewhere lord father may you give a revelation to your children lord about this walk lord because the time is gone we are in the long suffering time lord and sooner you're gonna close the door lord father of mercy and you will turn to the jewish people
