[0:00] enemy of fire. They found out when they
[0:02] went right down to the end staying on
[0:04] God's word, they possessed the gate.
[0:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[0:09] After Daniel,
[0:12] there had been a proclamation went forth
[0:14] and signed by the needs of Persians that
[0:16] could not be changed that if anybody
[0:22] prayed to any other god,
[0:25] let him be thrown into the lion's den.
[0:27] And Daniel knew that God's word was to
[0:31] pray to him on me. So he just opened up
[0:34] the windows and prayed anyhow. Now he
[0:37] never got back in a corner. He opened up
[0:38] the windows towards the temple. He
[0:41] wasn't ashamed of it. And we don't want
[0:44] to practice our religion on Sunday and
[0:46] Monday do something else or believe in
[0:47] our heart one thing, come before
[0:49] somebody else and say, "Well, I don't
[0:51] know. I Yeah, I think YOU'RE RIGHT." BE
[0:53] WHAT YOU ARE.
[0:55] &gt;&gt; You're not. Get out of the pull pit. Get
[0:57] out of the church. That's right. Because
[0:59] you're INDEBTED TO BOTH. SAY WHAT YOU
[1:02] ARE. SAY WHAT YOU BELIEVE. THEN YOU HAVE
[1:05] NOTHING to back up from. You're standing
[1:06] just exactly what's true. Everybody
[1:08] knows your colors.
[1:10] &gt;&gt; MAN WILL APPRECIATE YOU. ANY MAN, A
[1:13] WOMAN MIGHT BE AS UGLY AS ALL get out.
[1:16] She might be big, fat, little, skinny,
[1:18] blackheaded, browneyed, blue-eyed,
[1:20] grayeyed one one way and one THE OTHER.
[1:23] BUT IF THAT WOMAN IS clean lady
[1:29] in a man or country to take off his hat
[1:31] and he's got an ounce of man,
[1:33] &gt;&gt; right? Because she's SHE PRODUCES WHAT
[1:36] SHE is
[1:38] &gt;&gt; and man appreciate it.
[1:41] &gt;&gt; SO GOD APPRECIATE A MAN THAT'LL BE WHAT
[1:44] HE IS. OR MAN THAT PROFESSES
[1:46] CHRISTIANITY, LET'S BE A CHRISTIAN
[1:48] FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST, WITH THE
[1:50] WORD of God or forget about it. Amen.
[1:53] &gt;&gt; Right? Cuz otherwise you become
[1:55] hypocrisy and living a different life
[1:57] and people seem to run out there to
[2:00] dances and smoking and things like that
[2:02] and claiming to be a Christian and see
[2:04] you put a stumbling block in the other's
[2:05] way. See you women sometimes how they
[2:08] cut their hair and dressing act in these
[2:10] little dresses don't look like a skinned
[2:13] down weenie or something going out there
[2:15] on the street walking around a heels
[2:17] about that high mincing down the street.
[2:19] Is that Pentecostal? And the the other
[2:21] churches say they claim they've got
[2:22] something that they haven't.
[2:26] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE SEALED AND MARKED BY THE HOLY
[2:29] GHOST.
[2:32] &gt;&gt; You're not a dance hall tonight and
[2:34] hugged up in some man's arms that's not
[2:36] your husband the next night and come
[2:38] back to church and dance all over the
[2:39] place. That's not Pentecostal. That's
[2:41] hypocrisy.
[2:43] Phil,
[2:46] &gt;&gt; I'm not so much saying it to you, but
[2:48] you realize these tapes has made here
[2:49] goes over the world.
[2:51] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[2:53] &gt;&gt; So, I just preached like this to the
[2:55] whole world.
[2:57] &gt;&gt; When I feel God saying, "Say something."
[2:59] He just say it because I don't know
[3:00] where it's going to. That's up to him to
[3:02] take care of that. Just stay with the
[3:03] word.
[3:04] &gt;&gt; That's right. All right. No, Daniel
[3:08] would not bow down to their
[3:10] proclamation.
[3:12] Whether you stood out of the
[3:13] organization or not,
[3:14] &gt;&gt; he stayed RIGHT AT THE WINDOW AND STAYED
[3:16] WITH THE WORD OF GOD. HE WASN'T ASHAMED
[3:18] of it. What happened? They throw him
[3:21] into a lion's den, but he possessed the
[3:23] gates of the lion.
[3:26] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD.
[3:27] &gt;&gt; WHY?
[3:28] &gt;&gt; GLORY. GLORY TO GOD.
[3:30] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD SAID HIS seed shall possess
[3:35] the gate of the enemy.
[3:37] &gt;&gt; For what the enemy is, you got the gate.
[3:40] Oh, how many times can we look at Moses
[3:43] following in the line of God's
[3:45] commandments, went out into Egypt,
[3:47] LOOKED LIKE EVERYTHING WAS CONTRARY. He
[3:49] had some impersonators that went with
[3:51] him. He went out with a couple of signs
[3:53] to show that he was sent. Throw down a
[3:55] serpent and so forth like that. And here
[3:57] come the impersonators along, sold
[3:59] theirs down. WHAT COULD HE DO? NOTHING.
[4:02] GOD never told him to go to do that. He
[4:04] wanted to test Moses.
[4:07] He was the one who permitted Jambish and
[4:09] Jamus to throw down their serpents or
[4:11] their robbed. So there
[4:20] [Music]
[4:26] [Laughter]
[4:30] [Music]
[4:40] [Laughter]
[4:43] [Music]

[6:31] want to bless the name of the living
[6:33] God. Amen. But before then we just want
[6:35] to commit the service into the hands of
[6:37] the Lord and asking that he take
[6:40] preeminence tonight. We commit ourselves
[6:42] into his hands that he prepare our
[6:44] hearts even as he about using his vessel
[6:48] to speak onto us and also commit those
[6:51] on their way coming that the Lord will
[6:53] lead them safely into our midst. Let us
[6:55] pray. Father in the name of Jesus, we

[32:34] like to hold back some of this money, so
[32:37] I want him to give me back." So he when
[32:39] I hand him the money, he said, "Here you
[32:40] go. I'm giving you something back." I
[32:42] say, "Thank you, Jesus."
[32:45] &gt;&gt; So I want to say, "Praise the Lord."
[32:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:51] &gt;&gt; And we say, "Thank you, Jesus."
[32:54] &gt;&gt; And praise the Lord. Amen. Amen.
[32:59] &gt;&gt; It might look like it was a $100, but I
[33:02] believe in a God that multiplies.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. So whatever he did for sister
[33:08] Laura, he has the power to multiply.
[33:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. Amen.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Michael M. Amen.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[33:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; Happy. Yes, sir.
[33:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us all pray.
[33:37] Heavenly Father, one more time we come
[33:39] before you in this place that is
[33:42] dedicated and we call it your house, oh
[33:44] Lord. But just like the Bible says, you
[33:47] don't live in houses built by me. There
[33:51] is a house that is gathered here,
[33:54] Father, that you have provided for
[33:55] yourself in this age, oh God. Lord, we
[34:00] thank you for this group of people that
[34:02] love you. That no matter what the
[34:05] weather is, oh Lord, they will come to
[34:08] meet with us. Oh God, Lord, we want to
[34:12] glorify your name. We want to bless you,
[34:13] oh God, for your grace, for your
[34:16] mercies.
[34:17] You have done so much for us, oh Lord.
[34:20] How we thank you for the heaven of
[34:23] rest that you have given us in this last
[34:25] day, the message of the hour. Once you
[34:28] are in, you are settled up. Father, we
[34:31] are so thankful, Father. We can never
[34:33] take it lightly. Lord, this is the
[34:35] greatest thing you have done in this
[34:36] age. Oh God.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; And we want to thank you also for the
[34:40] preachers that you have raised to stand
[34:42] behind this word. Oh God, and support
[34:46] the message that was given by our
[34:47] prophet. Oh father. I remember when the
[34:50] prophet said, "Young people will raise
[34:52] up, oh God, and take this message
[34:55] forward.
[34:56] We believe you have blessed us with one
[34:58] in this church. And Lord, this may the
[35:00] glory and honor return back to you. I
[35:03] remember the mother and the baby.
[35:05] Father,
[35:06] &gt;&gt; Father, you can stop the bleeding.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; You can heal them all. Father,
[35:12] &gt;&gt; thank you Lord
[35:13] &gt;&gt; for blessing our dear sister L'Oreal
[35:15] with a deer and $100.
[35:18] Father, you're giving her back $100.
[35:21] Father, how we thank you for the simple
[35:24] faith. Just taking you at your word, oh
[35:26] Lord.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; And practicing in your father.
[35:29] &gt;&gt; Yes Lord.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; I remember sister Sharon. Oh God in your
[35:33] hand.
[35:33] &gt;&gt; Yes Lord.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; Father you are the greatest comforter.
[35:38] &gt;&gt; Father we come before trusting in you as
[35:41] you have done before. You'll do it for
[35:43] us. Father.
[35:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:44] &gt;&gt; Now we come to the moment that is more
[35:49] important. Father bless the tithes.
[35:52] Bless the preacher. God give him
[35:54] strength.
[35:56] &gt;&gt; Let him speak from you, Father. And
[35:59] Lord, we shall not be forgetful to thank
[36:02] you when we finish to say, Lord, thank
[36:04] you for speaking to us, Father.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. We ask these things,
[36:08] Father, believing in Jesus name. Amen.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen.
[36:16] &gt;&gt; So, we got a special from Sister Yubed
[36:19] and Sister Lily.
[36:21] through the fire. Amen.
[36:26] [Music]
[36:36] [Music]
[36:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you saints. Amen.
[36:47] [Music]
[36:52] So many times I've questioned
[36:55] certain circumstances
[36:58] or things I could not understand.
[37:05] Many times in trials,
[37:09] weakness blurs my vision and my
[37:13] frustration get so out of hand.
[37:18] Oh, it's then I am reminded
[37:22] I've never been forsaken.
[37:26] I've never had to stand
[37:29] one test alone.
[37:32] And as I look at all the victories,
[37:36] the spirit rises up in me. It's through
[37:40] the fire my weaknesses made strong.
[37:45] [Music]
[37:46] And oh,
[37:50] he never promised that the cross would
[37:54] not get heavy and the hill would not be
[37:59] hard to climb.
[38:03] No,
[38:04] he never offered
[38:07] our victories without fighting. But he
[38:10] said help would always come in time.
[38:15] Oh, just remember when you're standing
[38:20] in the valley of decision
[38:23] and the adversary said give in just
[38:33] our God will show up. Oh, and he will
[38:37] take you through the fire again.
[38:47] Oh, I know within myself that I will
[38:52] surely perish. Oh, but if I trust the
[38:56] hand of God, he'll shield the flames
[38:59] again.
[39:02] Again.
[39:07] He never promised that the cross will
[39:10] not get heavy and the hill will not be
[39:14] hard to
[39:20] he never offer.
[39:23] Our victories will come fighting but he
[39:26] said help would always come.
[39:30] Church, just remember,
[39:32] just remember when you're standing in
[39:36] the valley of decision.
[39:39] The adversary says give in. Just hold
[39:46] on.
[39:48] Our Lord will show up. Yeah. He will
[39:53] take you through the fire again.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, he never promised.
[40:00] He never promised that the cross will
[40:03] not get heavy and the hill would not be
[40:08] hard to climb.
[40:13] Oh, he never offered. Oh, our victory
[40:17] without fighting. But he said hell would
[40:21] always
[40:23] die.
[40:26] Just remember when you're standing in
[40:29] the valley of decision and the adversary
[40:35] says give it. Church, hold on.
[40:42] Our Lord will show up
[40:45] and he will take you through the fire
[40:49] again. Hold on, church. Hold
[40:54] on.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; And he will take you through the fire
[41:03] again.
[41:09] [Music]
[41:19] We take it again.
[41:22] over. Oh, I've been street fighting, but
[41:27] he said he'll put over
[41:30] time.
[41:32] Oh, just remember when you're standing
[41:37] in the valley of decision
[41:40] and the adversary says give
[41:46] just
[41:50] our God has showed up.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he has take you through
[41:55] the fire again.
[41:59] [Applause]
[42:01] Hallelujah.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:05] &gt;&gt; Lord, let's come to you.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; Today is really my anniversary. And I
[42:12] said, Lord,
[42:13] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; But I didn't GET IN TOUCH WITH HER and I
[42:20] left it alone. And you see, God is so
[42:23] fault.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's go again.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; I will
[42:30] &gt;&gt; I will annex that testimony and say I
[42:33] came to church with no special. Brother
[42:35] Seth asked in the back. He was like,
[42:37] "Does anybody have a special?" And my
[42:39] mouth just opened and say, "Sister Lily
[42:41] and I will sing a song." What song? No
[42:43] idea. Through the fire.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; That was God.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; Lord, I come to you.
[42:54] Let my heart be changed.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.

[43:08] that I found
[43:11] in

[43:22] Lord, I've come to know
[43:26] [Music]

[43:29] I see
[43:33] in me.

[48:58] &gt;&gt; And let the Holy Spirit do what he

[49:33] When you see the goodness of God and
[49:34] what he's doing in the life of his
[49:36] children, every single day in this
[49:38] church, testimonies, little little even
[49:41] in the little tiny detail things on our
[49:44] life, God is showing up. A very
[49:47] insignificant thing that we don't even
[49:49] think God is there. And here we go. He
[49:52] always showed up on time. Amen.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, we appreciate what the Lord is
[49:56] doing. Amen. Stay encouraged church. He
[50:00] disclosed to us faith in the way that
[50:02] even myself who was preaching never seen
[50:05] it. Amen.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; I I don't understand how a small
[50:09] scripture like that can hold so much
[50:11] things in it that you keep pulling, you
[50:13] keep pulling, you keep pulling, you keep
[50:15] pulling. God gave us the most essential
[50:18] the main thing and left faith in our
[50:20] hand because with faith we can create we
[50:24] can draw we can even buy purchase the
[50:26] Holy Spirit with faith. Amen. Amen. With
[50:31] faith you can even pull the Holy Spirit
[50:33] toward you. All it takes is faith. Faith
[50:35] for everything. And faith is our
[50:37] victory. The victory that overcometh the
[50:40] world is in faith. Amen.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; The world was created by faith. Amen.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; If you go to the stature of a perfect
[50:47] man, you look at the beginning, you see
[50:49] right there, faith. And once faith is
[50:52] there, everything is p is built on faith
[50:54] by revelation to revelation. There is
[50:57] not even anything you need to add.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; You don't have to add longsuffering. You
[51:02] just have faith for longsuffering. And
[51:04] after a while, you will see
[51:06] longsuffering happening in your life.
[51:07] Amen.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. We greet you all in
[51:11] the precious name of our Lord and Savior
[51:13] Jesus Christ. both visible and invisible
[51:16] audience. Amen. Any family member here,
[51:19] God richly bless you. New subscriber
[51:21] online, God bless you and welcome to
[51:23] Spoken Word Tabernacle in our convention
[51:26] on a Wednesday. Amen.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; Keep praying this prayer is doing great
[51:31] things.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Refreshing our soul, changing our
[51:35] life and the Holy Spirit is moving in a
[51:37] supernatural way. Amen. So keep praying.
[51:40] Everything is well. God is giving my
[51:42] wife a special strength. I know it's not
[51:45] easy in the body, but uh God knows and
[51:48] God knew that exactly she can take it at
[51:51] this time. Amen. Because if she would
[51:53] have take it last year, it could have
[51:55] been uh a different story and God hide
[51:58] everything since last year. They just
[52:00] come to find out this year something
[52:03] that already happened last year because
[52:05] he was in the war zone. Amen. So just
[52:08] continue to hold the family. She's here
[52:10] tonight very strong. We love you. The
[52:13] church support you. Stay strong. All is
[52:15] well and all it takes is a little bit of
[52:18] time and we will meet on the other side.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say there will be more
[52:22] surprises. There will be surprises over
[52:24] there.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; So it doesn't matter how or where people
[52:28] were just leave it alone in the hand of
[52:30] God.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; Sometime we act like we don't believe
[52:33] our own prayer.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. We pray God to save our family
[52:37] member
[52:38] &gt;&gt; and then when the Lord take them out
[52:40] because of our way our conception of the
[52:42] way they're supposed to be saved.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; You want them to come to the altar to be
[52:46] baptized and to do this to do this.
[52:48] That's the way we want them to be saved.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; But nobody knew the thief of the cross
[52:53] have to go a certain way.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; So you think they're going to go in the
[52:57] Broadway. But if if it was not written
[53:00] about the thief of the cross, nobody
[53:02] would have known. We would have seen two
[53:04] criminals going to hell. Didn't know
[53:06] that that one never was baptized.
[53:08] Brother Brandham say that he was there
[53:10] now and he dropped from there and went
[53:13] where Abraham was.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; And where you didn't get me where
[53:21] &gt;&gt; he didn't go where the at the criminal
[53:24] where no he went where Abraham was
[53:27] without water baptism without being
[53:30] preached the gospel. And brother
[53:32] Brandham say himself he was a preacher.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; I gave you I have five quote. Brother
[53:39] Brandham say he himself was a preacher.
[53:42] So the only opportunity he have to
[53:43] preach he was preaching now as a
[53:46] criminal.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; And that's his sermon right there.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; If it's me and you, we would have think
[53:50] he need to step on the pulpit to preach.
[53:53] Church, our mind are so narrow.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. God has many ways. All you have to
[53:58] do claim your family. whether they are
[54:01] in church or outside the church. Claim
[54:04] your family. Believe your family. And
[54:07] then at the end of the day, guess what?
[54:10] If you believe, faith will put them
[54:13] there.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[54:16] &gt;&gt; I have a pro I have a question for you.
[54:19] Did Moses get into the promised land?
[54:21] &gt;&gt; According to the Old Testament,
[54:23] &gt;&gt; Moses died outside the promised land.
[54:26] And the Bible says that the angel buried
[54:29] him. But in the New Testament
[54:33] &gt;&gt; on more transfiguration,
[54:35] Moses entered the promised land and was
[54:38] sitting right there in Israel. To you,
[54:41] he was lost.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; But the true reality, he entered the
[54:47] promised land through the blood of
[54:49] Calvary.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; The children of Arty Wright were making
[54:54] fun of brother Brana.
[54:57] Yes, sir.
[54:59] And the Holy Ghost didn't wait for them
[55:01] to repent.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; You didn't get, maybe you don't get me.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost didn't wait for those
[55:07] children to repent first
[55:09] &gt;&gt; and to be baptized to get there. The
[55:12] Holy Ghost in them, whatever they were
[55:14] doing, the Holy Ghost bypass everything
[55:18] &gt;&gt; and burn everything that was bad and got
[55:21] in their soul and sealed them without a
[55:23] repentance. Brother Brham didn't say
[55:26] they those children stop and they begin
[55:28] to repent and the Holy Ghost came.
[55:30] Uh-uh. The Holy Ghost bypass repentance.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Go read the message yourself.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; This message is powerful.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; And this message got benefit.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; There is a benefit to follow this
[55:46] message.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; The benefits is not just to get in
[55:49] heaven.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; The benefit of the message started from
[55:51] here.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Amen.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; All you have to do claim your loved one,
[55:58] put them there, take your hand off and
[56:01] let God pull them the way God knows that
[56:04] is best to bring them to heaven.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; Sometime God knew that that boy needed
[56:10] the cross to get where he's supposed to
[56:13] be.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; We wanted him a church. God say no, he's
[56:16] not going to come to church. He's going
[56:18] to come through the cross through that
[56:19] suffering as he's dying as a criminal.
[56:23] That is his entrance toward heaven.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Take your hand off your faith. Lose up
[56:35] your faith. This faith is unlimited
[56:38] &gt;&gt; and there is nothing that is impossible
[56:40] to God. No matter even if your brain got
[56:43] stuck, stop.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; Look at the faith. Just believe.
[56:47] Remember you say, "Father, I there is
[56:50] one day I prayed and I claimed this boy
[56:53] and I claimed this daughter of me. I
[56:56] know that you told me whatever I put in
[56:58] your hand, no one can plug them out.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; I don't care what the devil is doing,
[57:02] what the devil is showing me doing in
[57:04] their life,
[57:06] &gt;&gt; that's not my problem. My problem, I'm
[57:08] looking at the cross. Either we going to
[57:10] be like that father that was uh uh that
[57:13] that look at the nurse and say you are
[57:15] looking at the machine right there. Me
[57:18] I'm looking at the promise. So you have
[57:20] two choices depending on how you're
[57:21] looking at either you going to look at
[57:23] the circumstances and see what your son
[57:25] or what your loved one is doing or
[57:27] you're going to look at the cross and
[57:29] say that is not my problem. All I know I
[57:32] saw things happening in the life and the
[57:34] very last minute people are entering
[57:37] into heaven. the seed of God. Just know
[57:39] one thing, God will lose none of it.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Maybe you don't understand
[57:48] why you grew up in a certain family.
[57:52] Maybe you are the Joseph of the family.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; And it's going to take your faith
[57:57] &gt;&gt; to pull everybody into the family.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; So never neglect your faith. You could
[58:03] be the very Joseph of the family, the
[58:05] one that is there, the very centerpiece
[58:07] that will change everything in the
[58:09] family and God will work more with you
[58:12] to do a lot of things and you keep using
[58:14] your narrow mind because you want things
[58:16] the way you were preached or the way
[58:19] preacher so and so told you unlimited.
[58:21] God is unlimited. Amen. Claim and
[58:25] believe. Faith is your victory. Amen.
[58:28] When we are crying, we crying with hope.
[58:31] Why? Because one day we at least pray
[58:33] for that loved one. That's it.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say they are mother
[58:39] that don't gone in glory and their
[58:41] prayer will answer when the mothers are
[58:43] in glory. How can you explain? Only a
[58:45] prophet can go to glory and see that and
[58:48] come back and tell her. All of those
[58:50] things were put in our life in the tape
[58:52] to remove anxiety from us. Put it in the
[58:56] hand of the Lord and let's God handle.
[58:58] Amen.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. You happy now?
[59:02] &gt;&gt; If you happy and you know it, clap your
[59:04] hand.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Praise
[59:10] God. A whole exhortation has been given.
[59:13] So, let's pull on the gift of the Lord.

[1:07:23] scrimp tonight, he's here to deliver
[1:07:25] that.

[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; We just want to say that we're glad to
[1:07:33] be here tonight on convention night.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. Um, like the like the
[1:07:37] prophet says, the Holy Ghost, you got
[1:07:39] the Holy Ghost, you can't wait for the
[1:07:40] church doors to open.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; You know, we we may can't get up here
[1:07:43] every Wednesday, but every chance I can
[1:07:46] is is I count it all joy.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; I count it all joy.
[1:07:51] If you can get your Bibles and turn to
[1:07:54] the book of Exodus,
[1:08:00] Exodus chapter 3,
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; and we're going to start at verse 18.
[1:08:11] And when you get it, just just say,
[1:08:12] "Amen."
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads for a moment of
[1:08:17] prayer before we read the scriptures.
[1:08:19] Dear heavenly father God, we just we
[1:08:22] come to you humbly tonight, oh father,
[1:08:24] knowing, oh Lord God, that you have met
[1:08:27] us here tonight, oh father, Lord God, we
[1:08:29] want to lay all our burdens out on the
[1:08:31] altar tonight, oh Father, oh Lord God,
[1:08:33] that whatever the needs of your people
[1:08:35] that's in this building tonight, oh
[1:08:37] Father, we trust and believe that you
[1:08:38] will meet every need tonight, oh Father,
[1:08:41] we pray, oh Lord God, that you will get
[1:08:42] me out of your way, oh Father, and let
[1:08:44] your Holy Spirit speak to your children
[1:08:46] tonight and Lord God, and bless the
[1:08:48] remaining of this service and we Lord
[1:08:50] God I have the ability that you have
[1:08:52] given me to open up this Bible oh Lord
[1:08:54] but it's going to take you to unfold
[1:08:56] these words oh Lord oh Lord God we give
[1:08:59] it back to you in the name of Jesus
[1:09:00] Christ we pray amen
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:09:05] the book of Exodus chapter 3
[1:09:08] verse 18
[1:09:13] and
[1:09:16] it says is
[1:09:20] let me see what we can
[1:09:25] it says now Moses kept the flock of
[1:09:27] Jethro
[1:09:29] his father-in-law
[1:09:32] this might this verse one I'm sorry I'm
[1:09:34] sorry chapter um chapter 3 verse one it
[1:09:37] said now Moses kept the flock of Jethro
[1:09:40] his father-in-law
[1:09:43] the priest of Midian and he led the
[1:09:45] flock to the side of the desert and came
[1:09:49] to the mountain of God.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Even to Heler.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; You can have your seats.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:05] Now, if I look at the scripture tonight,
[1:10:08] I don't think it's by chance that Moses
[1:10:11] happened to be leading the flock of
[1:10:12] Jeff.
[1:10:15] Now, I I believe tonight that Moses was
[1:10:18] already going into his position.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; And God was already training him to lead
[1:10:25] to be in a leading position.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Now, believe that tonight.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; And it says that he led the flock to the
[1:10:33] backside of the desert.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; And he came to the mountain of God,
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; even to Her.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And I want you to know notice
[1:10:42] tonight that without God, this is just
[1:10:45] an ordinary mountain.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying?
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Without the presence of God, right?
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; This is just an ordinary mountain.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; And my subject tonight is the benefits
[1:11:00] and the change of ministry in the
[1:11:02] presence of God.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; The benefits.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; And the change of ministry.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. in the presence of God.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we take that for granted
[1:11:14] and you know, we we we can come so
[1:11:17] complacent sometimes and get and get
[1:11:20] content when we're in the presence of
[1:11:21] God.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; And sometimes when the trials of lives
[1:11:24] come on us, we forget where we at.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; And and sometime God, like we say, we're
[1:11:29] leaning on God cuz he's right there. But
[1:11:31] sometimes tests and trials makes us
[1:11:33] forget that we're still in his presence.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; That we're still in his presence or not.
[1:11:38] So it don't Sometimes we get tripped up
[1:11:40] on our journey,
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; but we are still in his presence.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "All you got to do IS
[1:11:45] JUST GO GET BACK home where you got off
[1:11:48] at."
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; So So we want to look at this tonight.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And it says, "And the verse
[1:11:54] two say, "And the angel of the Lord
[1:11:56] appeared unto him,
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; and a flame of fire,
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; right,
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; out of the midst of a bush,
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; and he looked
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; and behold, the bush burned with fire
[1:12:08] and the bush was not consumed."
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Like I say it again,
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; without the presence of the pillar of
[1:12:17] fire, this was just an ordinary bush.
[1:12:21] This was just an ordinary bush that me
[1:12:23] and you see from day to day. But because
[1:12:25] of the presence of the pillar of fire,
[1:12:27] this is not an ordinary pillar of fire.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; So we found out that this God was inside
[1:12:32] of this bush.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; So th this bush if if you want to if you
[1:12:36] want to look at the big picture, this
[1:12:39] bush was packing deliverance.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Inside of this bush lay deliverance.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; INSIDE OF THIS BUSH ALSO LAID A WAY
[1:12:47] MAKER.
[1:12:49] INSIDE OF THIS BUSH WAS THE PRESENCE OF
[1:12:51] GOD.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; So I want to let you know tonight that
[1:12:54] God lives in YOU TONIGHT.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; SO INSIDE of you LAYS DELIVERANCE.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; BESIDE INSIDE OF YOU LAYS A WAY MAKER.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; DELIVERANCE IS THE CLOSEST SOMEBODY
[1:13:04] going to get to deliverance is through
[1:13:05] you right now. YOU GOT THE POWER TO GIVE
[1:13:08] OUT DELIVERANCE. WHY? BECAUSE GOD LIVES
[1:13:10] IN YOU TONIGHT.
[1:13:11] [Applause]
[1:13:17] And verse three said, "And Moses said,
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; I would not turn aside
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; and see this great sight
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; while this bush is not burnt."
[1:13:28] First of all, when God when God begin to
[1:13:31] call this man, he already started
[1:13:33] working on Moses.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; He already started working on Moses, and
[1:13:36] we know that's how God worked. But when
[1:13:38] you look at this scripture right here,
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Moses turned aside.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; So it was no coincidence that Moses
[1:13:47] turned aside because God God did
[1:13:50] something extraordinary.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; That's exactly
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; to grab the attention of Moses.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; It's not every day that you walking
[1:13:57] around and see a a pillar of fire
[1:13:58] burning inside of a bush and the bush
[1:14:01] don't consume.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Let let's get that straight tonight.
[1:14:04] This is not something you see every day
[1:14:05] while you out. So, first thing God
[1:14:08] wanted to do was get Moses' attention.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; So, he he used a sign to get Moses
[1:14:13] attention.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; And he and he said, "And then that
[1:14:17] caused Moses to turn aside." Moses said,
[1:14:19] "I I think I'll turn aside and look at
[1:14:21] this burning bush that won't consume."
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; And God called unto him
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; out of the midst of the bush
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; and said, "Moses,
[1:14:31] Moses." And he said, "Here am I." Now
[1:14:34] here comes the voice right
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; behind the sign right
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; and he said draw not knock not hither
[1:14:41] put off thy shoes from off thy feet.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; For the place wherein thou standing is
[1:14:46] holy ground.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; So the presence of God made made this
[1:14:50] ground holy.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Like I said without the presence of God
[1:14:53] it was just an ordinary ground.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; So it's the presence of God tonight THAT
[1:14:58] MAKES THIS SANCTUARY holy tonight. It's
[1:15:01] the presence OF GOD IN YOUR LIVES THAT
[1:15:03] MAKES YOU holy tonight.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus said, "There's no good
[1:15:07] in me but the father."
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; In verse six, he says, "Moreover,"
[1:15:13] he said, "I am the God of thy father,
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; the God of Abraham,
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; the God of Isaac,
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; and the God of Jacob."
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; And Moses hid his face, for he was
[1:15:26] afraid to look upon God.
[1:15:29] Now God know exactly what he doing.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; First he gave Moses a sign. That's
[1:15:35] right.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; A a extraordinary sign
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; to grab his attention.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; And then when Moses turned to the side,
[1:15:42] God give him a voice to confirm
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; that it's him that's speaking to him. So
[1:15:48] what do we do? He he quotes the
[1:15:49] scriptures.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Look look and see what he does. He
[1:15:53] quotes the scriptures. He said, he said,
[1:15:55] "I am the God of thy father, the God of
[1:15:58] Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God
[1:16:01] of Jacob." And Moses hid his face
[1:16:03] because he he RECOGNIZED THAT GOD QUOTED
[1:16:06] THE SCRIPTURES. HE SAID, "THIS GOT TO BE
[1:16:07] GOD."
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; SEE, THE DEVIL IS NOT GOING TO QUOTE THE
[1:16:10] SCRIPTURES.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; And if he do quote it, he going to quote
[1:16:12] IT OUT OF CONTEXT.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; HE CAME to Jesus after his 40-day fast
[1:16:16] and he said, "IS IT NOT WRITTEN?" BUT
[1:16:20] BUT Jesus said IT ALSO WRITTEN THAT YOU
[1:16:22] SHALL NOT TEMPT THE LORD THY GOD.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; SEE he used the scriptures on Jesus but
[1:16:27] he didn't use it the right way.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says YOU GOT TO ALWAYS
[1:16:32] CATCH THAT VOICE BEHIND the sign.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; He say God ALWAYS GIVE YOU A SCRIPTURE
[1:16:36] VOICE BEHIND THAT SIGN TO VINDICATE IT.
[1:16:39] THAT IS HIM THAT'S SPEAKING to you.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Come on. Yes sir. In verse 7,
[1:16:44] he says, "And the Lord said, I have
[1:16:47] surely seen the affliction of my people,
[1:16:49] yes sir,
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; which are in Egypt, and have heard their
[1:16:52] cry by reason of their task masters, for
[1:16:54] I know their sorrows."
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; And I am come down to deliver them out
[1:17:00] of the hand of the Egyptians.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; So right there, there's deliverance just
[1:17:04] speaking out of a bush.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Deliverance. He's saying to bring them
[1:17:08] up out of the land into a good land
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; and a large Yes, sir.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; into a land flowing with milk and honey.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; Unto the place of the Canaanites and the
[1:17:17] Hittites and the Amorites and the
[1:17:19] Parasites and the Hivites and the
[1:17:21] Jebusites.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now therefore, behold, the cry
[1:17:26] of the children of Israel is coming to
[1:17:28] me."
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; And I have also seen the oppression
[1:17:31] wherewith the Egyptians oppressed them.
[1:17:33] And he tells them in verse 10, he said,
[1:17:35] "Come now therefore, and I will send
[1:17:37] thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest
[1:17:39] bring forth my people, the children of
[1:17:42] Israel, out of Egypt."
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Now, watch this. Watch. Moses is going
[1:17:47] to be a natural man. He's going to
[1:17:48] respond like a natural man. He says,
[1:17:50] "And Moses said unto God, who am I that
[1:17:53] I should go into Pharaoh, and that I
[1:17:56] should bring forth the children of
[1:17:57] Israel out of Egypt?" And he says,
[1:17:59] "Certainly, I will be with thee,
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; and this shall be a token unto thee,
[1:18:03] that I have sent thee, when thou hast
[1:18:06] brought forth the people out of Egypt,
[1:18:08] you shall serve God upon this mountain."
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; And Moses said unto God, "Behold, when I
[1:18:15] come unto the children of Israel, and
[1:18:18] shall say unto them, the God of your
[1:18:20] fathers have sent me unto you, and they
[1:18:23] shall say to me, what is his name? What
[1:18:26] shall I say unto thee?" See, Moses
[1:18:29] already know he was going to have
[1:18:30] problem with these people when he went
[1:18:31] down there. He already know that he had
[1:18:33] to he had to have something to God had
[1:18:35] to back him up when he go down there. He
[1:18:37] can't just go down there and say, "God
[1:18:39] sent me."
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; He he already know it's going to take
[1:18:41] more than that.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; And he said, he says, u what shall I say
[1:18:47] unto them? And and God said unto Moses,
[1:18:51] I am that I am. And he said, "Thus shall
[1:18:54] thou say unto the children of Israel,
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; I am have sent me unto you."
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; And I want you to catch this. Then God
[1:19:01] says, "Moreover, unto Moses." So God God
[1:19:06] remembered the promise that Joseph made
[1:19:08] to him. He's saying moreover until Moses
[1:19:11] that thou shall say unto the children of
[1:19:12] Israel, the Lord God your fathers, the
[1:19:15] God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and
[1:19:18] the God of Jacob has sent me unto you.
[1:19:22] This is my name forever and this is my
[1:19:24] memorial unto all generations.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; And and see God knew that um Joseph made
[1:19:30] a oath and he told him that God was
[1:19:33] going to visit them.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; So So God was telling Moses that when
[1:19:38] you go to f first of all, let's back up.
[1:19:40] The signs that God gave Moses, they
[1:19:43] weren't just for Pharaoh. These signs
[1:19:46] was also for the children of Israel. So,
[1:19:48] so the signs that God gave Moses to
[1:19:51] perform when he went down, it it just
[1:19:52] want to prove to Pharaoh that God sent
[1:19:54] him down there, it was also to prove to
[1:19:56] the people.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; So, it had he had two reasons for the
[1:20:00] signs.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; In verse 16, he said, "Go and gather the
[1:20:04] elders of Israel together." Watch what
[1:20:07] he says. and say unto them, the Lord God
[1:20:09] of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of
[1:20:11] Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me,
[1:20:14] saying, I have surely visited you, and
[1:20:17] seen that which is done to you in Egypt.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; And he says, and I have said, I will
[1:20:21] bring you up out of the afflictions of
[1:20:23] Egypt, unto the land of the Canaanites,
[1:20:26] and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and
[1:20:28] the Parasites, and the Hivites, and the
[1:20:30] Jebusites, and to a land flowing with
[1:20:32] milk and honey. That's the promise.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. and they shall hearken to thy
[1:20:35] voice and thou shalt come thou and the
[1:20:38] elders of Israel and to the king of
[1:20:40] Egypt. He said, "And you shall say unto
[1:20:42] him, the Lord God of the Hebrews have
[1:20:45] met with us, and now let us go." See,
[1:20:48] God never addressed Pharaoh the way that
[1:20:50] he addressed the children of Israel. He
[1:20:52] said, "You tell Pharaoh that the Lord
[1:20:54] God of the Hebrews had met with us." He
[1:20:57] said, "Now let us go. We beseech thee
[1:20:59] three days journey into the wilderness
[1:21:00] that we may sacrifice to the Lord our
[1:21:03] God. Now in the message the angel of the
[1:21:06] Lord parag
[1:21:09] 1951 paragraph 26 but a Brandon say all
[1:21:13] right notice now he said that when God
[1:21:15] spoke to him he attracted his attention
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; Yes sir
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; by a pillar of fire
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; that fell into a bush
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; and he began to burn and pop and burn.
[1:21:25] He says, he said, "Now it looks like if
[1:21:27] it was fire, it would have scorched the
[1:21:30] bush or burned it."
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; He said, "But it was a supernatural fire
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; who could burn the bush and yet it will
[1:21:37] still be there."
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'M THINKING TONIGHT OF A
[1:21:41] SUPERNATURAL,
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit,
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; GOD'S FLAME OF fire who could come down
[1:21:47] in the human heart,
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; burn out all the sin, unbelief, and
[1:21:52] don't harm the person." He said, "But it
[1:21:54] purges him,
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; make him grow greater,
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; BE STRONGER,
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; MORE FAITH."
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; AND HE COMES TONIGHT IN THAT WAY.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; He says he come DOWN INTO A HUMAN BODY,
[1:22:07] DRIVE OUT THE POWER OF CANCER,
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; a tumor, a cataract,
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; tuberculosis with fire. He say heavenly
[1:22:15] holy spirit fire falling from God of
[1:22:17] heaven.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; He said why mine? That's no mystery. He
[1:22:21] say if he can burn imbre sin out, how
[1:22:24] much more can he burn cancer OUT BY THE
[1:22:27] SAME HOLY SPIRIT?
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; He said we got witnesses on both sides,
[1:22:33] men and women who were once sinners,
[1:22:35] lost in sin.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Come to the world speaking lies shaped
[1:22:39] in iniquity.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Now go to Exodus chapter 4. We're going
[1:22:44] to jump. I'm I'mma jump to save time. Go
[1:22:46] to Exodus chapter 4,
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; verse one.
[1:22:50] Yes.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; And Moses answered and said, "But
[1:22:54] behold, they will not believe me, nor
[1:22:56] hearken unto my voice, for they will
[1:22:58] say, the Lord have not impered thee."
[1:23:01] And see, he's telling him what the
[1:23:02] children of Israel were going to say.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Cuz his first his first job was to
[1:23:06] convince the children of Israel that God
[1:23:08] sent him.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; That was his first mission. So when the
[1:23:11] Lord said unto him, "What is what is
[1:23:13] that in thine hand?" And he said, "A
[1:23:16] rod." And he said, "Cast it on the
[1:23:18] ground." and he cast it on the ground
[1:23:20] and it became a serpent and Moses fled
[1:23:22] from before it. See, now this is the
[1:23:24] beginning of Moses' ministry.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; This is the beginning of Moses ministry
[1:23:29] right here.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; So God began to show him the signs that
[1:23:34] he would he would begin to perform once
[1:23:36] he got down there.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; And the Lord said, "Put forth thine hand
[1:23:41] and take it by the tail." And he put
[1:23:42] forth his hand and caught it, and it
[1:23:44] became a rod in his hand.
[1:23:47] that that may believe that the Lord God
[1:23:49] of th their fathers, the God of Abraham
[1:23:51] and the God of Isaac and the God of
[1:23:53] Jacob have appeared to thee. So God is
[1:23:55] saying they they're going to believe you
[1:23:57] when you do these signs when you go down
[1:23:59] there. And he said, "And the Lord said
[1:24:01] furthermore to him, put not thy hand
[1:24:03] into thy bosom."
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; And he put his hand into his bosom. And
[1:24:06] when he took it out, behold, his hands
[1:24:09] were lepous and snow. And he said, "Put
[1:24:12] thy hand into thy bosom again." And he
[1:24:14] put his hand into th his bosom again,
[1:24:16] and he plucked it out of his bosom, and
[1:24:18] behold, it was turned again as his other
[1:24:20] flesh.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; And verse eight said, "And it shall come
[1:24:23] to pass, if they will not believe thee,
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; neither hearken to the voice of the
[1:24:29] first sign."
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; He said, "That they will believe the
[1:24:31] voice of the latter sign."
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; He's saying, "It shall come to pass if
[1:24:35] they will not believe also these two
[1:24:37] signs. Neither hearken unto thy voice
[1:24:40] that thou shalt take the water of the
[1:24:42] river and pour it upon the dry land. He
[1:24:44] saying, "And the water which thou takest
[1:24:46] out of the river shall become blood upon
[1:24:48] the dry land." That's right.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Then in verse 10, he says, "And Moses
[1:24:52] said unto the Lord, oh my Lord, I am not
[1:24:54] eloquent." Moses making excuses.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; He said, "Neither here to hear for nor
[1:25:00] since thou hast spoken unto thy servant,
[1:25:02] but I am slow of speech and of a slow
[1:25:04] tongue." So you can come up with all
[1:25:06] excuses you want, but when God chooses
[1:25:08] man, there's nothing you going to carry
[1:25:11] out the orders.
[1:25:12] [Music]
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; There's no coincidence that you in this
[1:25:15] message. There's nothing that you can do
[1:25:17] to get away from this message. If this
[1:25:19] message is for you tonight, there's
[1:25:21] nothing that you can do to get out of
[1:25:22] it. YOU CAN TRY TO QUIT IF YOU WANT TO,
[1:25:24] but there's nothing that you can do to
[1:25:26] get out of it.
[1:25:27] [Music]
[1:25:30] [Applause]
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; And skip down to verse 15. He said, "And
[1:25:34] thou shalt speak unto him and put words
[1:25:37] in his mouth, and I will be with thy
[1:25:39] mouth, and with his mouth, and will
[1:25:42] teach you what you shall do."
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; He said, he says, "And and he shall be
[1:25:46] the spokes spokesman unto the people."
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; And he shall be even he shall be thee
[1:25:52] instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to
[1:25:54] him instead of God.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; He said, "And thou shalt take this rod
[1:25:58] in thy hand wherewith thou shalt sign do
[1:26:00] signs." And Moses went and returned.
[1:26:03] Verse 18 said, "Moses went and returned
[1:26:05] to Jethro, his father-in-law, and said
[1:26:07] unto him, let me go, I pray thee, and
[1:26:09] return unto my brethren which are in
[1:26:11] Egypt, and see whether they be yet
[1:26:14] alive." And Jethro said to Moses, "Go in
[1:26:16] peace."
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; He said, "And the Lord said unto Moses
[1:26:20] and Midian, go return into Egypt, for
[1:26:22] all the men are dead which sought thy
[1:26:24] life." And Moses took his wife and his
[1:26:26] sons, and he and he set them upon an
[1:26:28] ass, and he returned to the land of
[1:26:30] Egypt. And Moses took the rod of God in
[1:26:32] his hand. Now the scriptures say Moses
[1:26:35] took the rod of God.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Now in the beginning, this rod was was
[1:26:40] just an ordinary rod that Moses had. But
[1:26:44] because this rod went in the presence of
[1:26:47] God
[1:26:48] BECAUSE THIS ROD WAS LAID IN THE
[1:26:50] PRESENCE OF GOD, NOW IT'S no longer
[1:26:52] Moses Moses's rod. IT'S THE ROD OF GOD.
[1:26:56] SO ANYTIME YOU COME INTO THE PRESENCE OF
[1:26:58] GOD, WHATEVER YOU LAY BEFORE HIM, IT
[1:27:00] DON'T BELONG TO YOU ANYMORE. IT'S GOD.
[1:27:04] SO THAT'S WHY WE COMMITTED NOW TO LAY
[1:27:06] OUR BURDENS, ALL OUR PROBLEMS IN THE
[1:27:10] PRESENCE OF THE LORD. CUZ ONCE WE LAY
[1:27:12] THEM THERE, THEY NO LONGER BELONG TO US.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; ALL YOUR TESTES, ALL YOUR TRIALS, THEY
[1:27:19] NO LONGER BELONG TO YOU. SO ALL YOU GOT
[1:27:22] TO DO IS JUST LAY THEM IN HIS PRESENCE.
[1:27:26] Just put him in his presence.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; Put it in his presence.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; And the message, take the rod and gather
[1:27:40] the people.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; 1950 paragraphs 21.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham saying that in that and
[1:27:47] the rod that Moses had in his hand,
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; he said it was not the rod of Moses.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; He said it was the rod of God.
[1:27:54] He said it was God's judgment rod.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; He said Mo Moses held it out over Egypt
[1:28:00] and flies came up. He said he held it
[1:28:02] out and fleas came up. He said wherever
[1:28:05] he dumped this rod, it was a judgment
[1:28:07] rod. He said it brought judgment upon a
[1:28:10] disobedient people and the rod was
[1:28:13] Christ, the substitute for sin and
[1:28:15] sickness.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; He said Moses took the judgment rod and
[1:28:18] smoked the rod to bring forth water. He
[1:28:20] said, "Therefore, it was the judgment
[1:28:22] rod of God that smoked Jesus and killed
[1:28:24] him."
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; He said, "The innocent one and brought
[1:28:27] from him flowed the Holy Spirit to a
[1:28:30] perishing people." Now, he said, "That
[1:28:32] we have life."
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; He said, "NO MORE DO WE SMITE the rock,
[1:28:36] but we speak to the rock."
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; He said, and watch the nouns and
[1:28:40] pronouns. He said, if he said, "Speak to
[1:28:42] the rock, and it shall bring forth his
[1:28:45] water."
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Speak to the rock and it shall bring
[1:28:48] forth his water. That's right.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; In the book of Exodus 7:9,
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; the Bible say, "When Pharaoh shall speak
[1:28:59] to you, when Pharaoh shall speak unto
[1:29:01] youhu,
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; saying, show a miracle for you, then
[1:29:04] thou shall say unto Aaron, take the rod
[1:29:06] and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall
[1:29:08] become a serpent." He says, "And Moses
[1:29:10] and Aaron went unto Pharaoh, and they
[1:29:13] did so as the Lord commanded." Uh-huh.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; And Aaron cast down his rod before
[1:29:17] Pharaoh and before his servants, and he
[1:29:19] became a serpent. And we know and we
[1:29:21] know this story,
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; Janice and Jammers impersonated.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; This sign.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; And they went to the second sign and God
[1:29:31] um Moses began to call the frogs. He
[1:29:33] called he called the frogs out of the
[1:29:35] river and they impersonated these
[1:29:38] things. But what I want you to get
[1:29:40] tonight,
[1:29:41] as long as you in the presence of God,
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. and you a believer tonight.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Somehow down the road, God is going to
[1:29:49] change your ministry. That's right.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; He's going to change your ministry.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; It's impossible for you to be stuck on
[1:29:56] the first and second pull.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; It's impossible FOR YOU TO STAY THERE.
[1:30:01] If you a believer tonight and you in THE
[1:30:03] PRESENCE OF GOD, AT SOME POINT OF YOUR
[1:30:06] LIFE, GOD IS GOING TO ELEVATE YOU AND
[1:30:08] PULL YOU UP HIGHER into the third pull
[1:30:12] BECAUSE THAT'S THE BRIDE OF CHRIST IS
[1:30:14] THE ONLY ONE THAT GOT A THIRD GEAR. ONLY
[1:30:17] THE IMPERSONATORS CAN GO NO FURTHER THAN
[1:30:19] THAT SECOND GEAR. BUT THE BRIDE OF
[1:30:21] CHRIST HAS AN EXTRA GEAR TONIGHT. AND
[1:30:24] GOD IS GOING TO MAKE SURE HE GOING TO
[1:30:26] MAKE SURE THAT YOU MAKE IT TO THAT THIRD
[1:30:28] LEVEL. WHY? BECAUSE HE SAW YOU GETTING
[1:30:31] THERE.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; SO WHY YOU IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD OR
[1:30:35] NOT? WHY ARE WE SO BASED TONIGHT? WHY
[1:30:38] YOU WON'T JUST ASK FOR WHATEVER YOU NEED
[1:30:40] TONIGHT? WHY YOU WON'T JUST SPEAK what
[1:30:42] you need tonight? THE ENEMY HAS TRAPPED
[1:30:45] US FOR SO LONG TILL WE DONE GOT CONTENT
[1:30:47] BELIEVING THAT WE GOT TO GO PRAY FOR
[1:30:49] EVERYTHING THAT WE GOT TO WE GOT TO GO
[1:30:52] FAST AND PRAY FOR EVERYTHING. BUT GOD
[1:30:53] SAY SPEAK.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; GOD SAY SPEAK TO THE ROCK.
[1:30:58] HOW LONG IT GOING TO TAKE YOU TO SPEAK
[1:31:00] TO THE ROCK?
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; WE ARE IN HIS PRESENCE RIGHT NOW. HOW
[1:31:04] MANY OF Y'ALL POSSESS THE HOLY GHOST
[1:31:05] TONIGHT? IF YOU POSSESS THE HOLY GHOST,
[1:31:08] RAISE YOUR HAND TONIGHT. WELL, YOU ARE
[1:31:10] ETERNALLY IN GOD'S PRESENCE TONIGHT. SO
[1:31:13] YOU ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS JUST SPEAK
[1:31:15] TONIGHT. WHATEVER IT IS YOU NEED, YOU
[1:31:17] JUST SAY THE WORD TONIGHT. GOD IS RIGHT
[1:31:20] HERE IN YOUR PRESENCE. HE'S RIGHT HERE
[1:31:22] IN YOUR PRESENCE. IF YOU NEED
[1:31:24] DELIVERANCE, YOU SPEAK IT TONIGHT. IF
[1:31:26] YOU NEED TO BE HEALED, YOU SPEAKING
[1:31:28] TONIGHT.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; HE'S RIGHT HERE.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT SO FAR-FETCHED OUT.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; REAL ETERNALLY IN HIS PRESENCE. I DON'T
[1:31:38] HAVE TO WAIT TILL I GET TO CHURCH TO BE
[1:31:40] IN HIS PRESENCE. I DON'T HAVE TO WAIT
[1:31:42] TILL I GO ON MY KNEES AND PRAY TO BE IN
[1:31:43] HIS PRESENCE. WHEN I GO TO SLEEP AT
[1:31:45] NIGHT, I'M IN HIS PRESENCE. WHEN I WAKE
[1:31:47] UP IN THE MORNING, I'M IN HIS PRESENCE.
[1:31:49] WHEN I'M RIDING DOWN THE ROAD IN MY CAR,
[1:31:51] I'M IN HIS PRESENCE. WHEN I GO ON MY
[1:31:53] JOB, I'M IN HIS PRESENCE.
[1:31:58] SO THAT MEAN I CAN SPEAK WHEREVER I'M
[1:32:00] AT.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; WHEREVER YOU AT, YOU CAN JUST SPEAK THE
[1:32:03] WORD.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; AND SEE WHAT WE WAITING ON IS A SPECIAL
[1:32:08] ATMOSPHERE.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; YOU CREATE THE ATMOSPHERE.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; IF YOU WILL HUMBLE YOURSELF TONIGHT, YOU
[1:32:16] CREATE THE ATMOSPHERE. GOD GOD IS VEILED
[1:32:19] INSIDE OF YOU.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; THAT MEANS WHEREVER YOU GO, HE'S THERE.
[1:32:24] SO
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; SPEAK TO HIM. TALK TO HIM LIKE A MAN.
[1:32:29] [Applause]
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Talk to him like a man.
[1:32:36] [Music]
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; And see this is the pressure of the en
[1:32:43] that the enemy puts on the believers cuz
[1:32:45] he brings so much pres pressure to he
[1:32:47] want you to forget that you were still
[1:32:48] in his presence.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; That's right. You may have tripped up
[1:32:52] and fall or failed today or or did
[1:32:55] something out the ordinary and he tells
[1:32:57] you that you you know you God left you
[1:32:59] or something. No, you're still in his
[1:33:00] presence. You just you just make it
[1:33:02] right.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; You just repent and MAKE IT RIGHT. BUT
[1:33:06] GOD IS ALWAYS THERE. HE'S RIGHT THERE.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; He's always there.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; He's always there.
[1:33:17] And we begin when they begin to do the
[1:33:19] signs, we we notice that the
[1:33:21] impersonator, they they went so far,
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; They went so far. And we and we've seen
[1:33:25] in the scriptures that when when God God
[1:33:28] told u Moses to the dust
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; and and and and they tried to imitate
[1:33:34] this and they found out they couldn't do
[1:33:36] that and they they said this is surely
[1:33:38] this got to be the finger of God. So, so
[1:33:40] God is God is not going to linger around
[1:33:43] too long with impersonators.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; He going to let them hang around for so
[1:33:47] long and after a while he going to shift
[1:33:49] gears because he got we are peculiar
[1:33:52] people tonight. We are different. WE GOT
[1:33:54] TO BE SEPARATED FROM THAT GROUP.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; We got to be separated from that group.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; And if you notice all the plagues that
[1:34:02] came in Egypt,
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; the magi were never able to reverse the
[1:34:08] plagues.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:34:10] I'm going to stay right here for a
[1:34:11] minute.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE POWER TO HEAL.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; THEY CALLED THE FROGS UP OUT OF THE
[1:34:16] RIVER, but it took MOSES TO SEND THEM
[1:34:18] BACK IN the river.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; And see, that's how the enemy do. He can
[1:34:22] put He CAN PUT YOU IN A CORNER, BUT HE
[1:34:25] CAN'T BRING YOU BACK OUT.
[1:34:27] SO THAT'S SO THAT'S WHERE GOD COMES IN
[1:34:29] AND HE TAKES US TO THAT NEXT level
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; into a level THAT THEY CAN'T
[1:34:34] IMPERSONATE.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; And I look through the scriptures, I
[1:34:37] say,
[1:34:39] MOSES CALLED GOD CALLED THE FROGS OUT of
[1:34:41] the river.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; They did the same thing, but they
[1:34:44] couldn't make them return. So all they
[1:34:46] did was made their problem worse.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; All they DID WAS BRING MORE PROBLEMS
[1:34:52] UPON THEMSELVES.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; SO SO AN IMPERSONATOR, THAT'S ALL HE
[1:34:57] DOING IS BRINGING MORE MORE PROBLEMS ON
[1:34:59] THE SELF. THEY BRINGING MORE PROBLEMS ON
[1:35:01] ITSELF.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; ALL THEY doing is making his life
[1:35:04] miserable.
[1:35:06] Yes sir.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; These do not have the power to heal.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Now we and now we're looking at this
[1:35:20] ministry of Moses. This this this
[1:35:22] ministry went down there and it did two
[1:35:24] things. It did two things. It delivered
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; the children of Israel.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; It opened their eyes
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; that he was the deliverer. But it also
[1:35:35] blinded Pharaoh and the Egyptians.
[1:35:37] That's right.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; So, so this this ministry that went down
[1:35:41] there, it had a two-fold purpose.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; It saved his people, but it also blinded
[1:35:46] the enemy.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; And and thanks for the Holy Ghost Sunday
[1:35:49] through, Brother Stephen. I I I was
[1:35:51] looking I like PHARAOH TRIED.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; HE TRIED TO LET THE people go,
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; but his heart was hardened. And and I
[1:36:00] and I looked through the scripture and I
[1:36:01] asked God, I said, "Lord, why didn't he
[1:36:03] just LET HIM GO,
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; BUT I FOUND OUT SUDDENLY THROUGH THE
[1:36:06] HOLY GHOST, 10 WAS A BAD NUMBER
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; and 10 was the NUMBER OF THE ENEMY." SO
[1:36:11] GOD HELD THAT THING OUT TO 10 PLAGUES.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; 10 PLAGUES
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; CUZ HE COULD HAVE LET HIM GO.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; WHY 10 PLAGUES?
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; WHY 10 PLAGUES?
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; AND THE HOLY SPIRIT OPENED THAT UP. I
[1:36:26] SAID, "OH, NOW I SEE WHY IT HAD TO BE 10
[1:36:28] place cuz Pharaoh WANTED TO LET HIM GO
[1:36:31] BEFORE THAT." SO WHY DID GOD HOLD THIS
[1:36:33] THING GOT TO 10 PLACE?
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Bren,
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; I never seen that quote. Brother Brandon
[1:36:42] say, "It's a bad number. It's the number
[1:36:44] of the enemy."
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; And Pharaoh was the enemy.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; He tried to let him go.
[1:36:51] He went and and and Pharaoh was crying
[1:36:54] and he would ask Moses to go back and
[1:36:56] retreat to God. He would tell God to
[1:36:58] take the curse off.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Every every plague,
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; he would go to Moses, tell Moses to go
[1:37:02] to God and remove it because God is the
[1:37:06] only one that can heal. That actually
[1:37:07] was that actually was a demonstration of
[1:37:09] healing.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; That was a demonstration of healing.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes sir.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; In the message shalom
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; 1964
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; paragraph 173
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; brother Baron said when when we hear the
[1:37:25] symphony beating
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; changing
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; fixing to change.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; He said it's a junction time.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; He said we notice as he began to beat
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; and we seen the works that I do shall
[1:37:38] you do also.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; And greater shall you do.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; He says greater
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; he promised it. We wonder how it could
[1:37:45] be.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; He said, "But you notice when he
[1:37:48] performed his first miracle, sir.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; He took water and turned it to wine."
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; He said he took water, which potentially
[1:37:56] someday might have been wine.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; He said, "But it was water first."
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; He said, "And when he fed 5,000,
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; what did he do?"
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; He took something that had been like
[1:38:08] water. HE TOOK A FISH THAT ONCE swam
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; and was born from an egg.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; He said he broke it
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; and another fish grow into the creation
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; that was the original creation.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; He said he took the bread that once was
[1:38:23] wheat.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; He said it was a seed and be and it
[1:38:26] became bread and he broke from this
[1:38:29] bread and the creation only multiplied.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; He said but in the woods there
[1:38:35] HE SAID THERE WAS NOTHING THERE TO MAKE
[1:38:37] A SQUIRREL.
[1:38:40] WATCH THE CHANGING OF THE MINISTRY.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; He said THERE WAS NOTHING THERE TO MAKE
[1:38:45] a squirrel.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "LET THERE BE."
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "AND THERE WAS."
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "WITHOUT ANYTHING TO BREAK IT
[1:38:53] FROM."
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "WHAT IS IT?" He He say IT'S
[1:38:57] THE SAME JESUS CHRIST. SEE,
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; greater things than this will you do. He
[1:39:02] said, "For I go to my father,
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; NOT TAKE SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN CREATED,
[1:39:07] break something from it, and multiply a
[1:39:09] creation." He said, "But absolutely
[1:39:12] create."
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; HE SAY, SHOWING THAT HE'S THE SAME
[1:39:15] JEHOVAH THAT STOOD BACK THERE AND SAID,
[1:39:18] "LET THERE BE."
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; HE SAY, "AND THERE WAS." HE SAY HIS WORD
[1:39:22] WAS MADE MANIFEST. He said when he was
[1:39:25] made flesh on earth, he took his
[1:39:28] original creation. HE SAY HE BROKE IT
[1:39:30] BACK and multiplied it. He said now but
[1:39:33] in the last days
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; WHEN HE COMES DOWN AMONG US again he
[1:39:38] said he said that same LIGHT THAT MOVED
[1:39:41] DOWN SAID LET there be light.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; See he just speak the creation into
[1:39:46] existence. HE SAID GREATER THAN THIS
[1:39:48] WILL you do.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; FOR I GO TO MY FATHER REMEMBER.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; He said REMEMBER WE ARE AT THESE TIMES.
[1:39:57] [Applause]
[1:40:07] [Music]
[1:40:09] And if you notice when mo when Moses
[1:40:11] went down to Egypt, God never revealed
[1:40:14] himself in Egypt in the form of the
[1:40:17] pillar of fire.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; He He never did it there. He waited till
[1:40:22] he called his people out. He separated
[1:40:24] them. He took him back to the mountain.
[1:40:27] THAT'S WHEN HE FIRST SPOKE. THAT'S WHEN
[1:40:28] HE delivered a pillow of fire. He spoke
[1:40:30] out of the pillar of fire.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; Believe you must
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; in the message show us the father and it
[1:40:44] suffices.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 51 in 1950. He said he was a
[1:40:50] god man.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; He said I believe he was the infinite
[1:40:53] son of God.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. born of the Virgin Mary.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; That's right. He said everything the
[1:40:58] Bible said he was, I believe he was.
[1:41:01] Yes, sir.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; He said he was on earth. He looked like
[1:41:04] God.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; He talked like God.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; He preached like God.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; And he rose like God.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; He ascended like God.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; God was in him.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; God manifested here in a body of flesh.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; On the earth in a form,
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; his son Christ Jesus.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; And brother Bon say notice. He said God
[1:41:24] was in his son.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; He was always He said God deals back
[1:41:28] there in the beginning when he was with
[1:41:30] the Israelites coming through the
[1:41:32] wilderness. He said there was a rock
[1:41:34] going along there following them. A
[1:41:37] spiritual rock. That's right.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; He said GOD TOLD MOSES SMITE the rock
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; and it'll bring forth water.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; Now brother B say what was it? He said
[1:41:46] he smoked it with the rod that was in
[1:41:47] his hand.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; He said that rod wasn't Moses rod. That
[1:41:51] that was God's rod. the judgment.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; He say and he smoked the rock and the
[1:41:56] rock brought forth the water.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; Now this is the same rock that he smoked
[1:41:59] with the judgment rock with the judgment
[1:42:01] rod. This is the same rock that Christ
[1:42:03] was standing upon.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; He say and when one time they wanted a
[1:42:07] drink, they went to the rock.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; He said when they wanted something to
[1:42:10] eat, they went down and a bunch of bees
[1:42:12] had a hive in there. He say in the rock
[1:42:15] there was a cliff. God stood in the
[1:42:17] cliff. The bees had their nest in the
[1:42:20] cliff. He says, he said, "Anything that
[1:42:22] had anything they had need of, they went
[1:42:24] to the rock." And the Bible clearly
[1:42:26] teaches that Christ was that rock that
[1:42:29] was in the wilderness.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; He said, "If you're thirsty tonight, go
[1:42:33] to the rock."
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "If you want honey, sweetness,
[1:42:36] go to the rock." He said, "IF YOU WANT
[1:42:38] LIFE, GO TO THE ROCK." He said, "If you
[1:42:41] want to believe God was in his son, go
[1:42:43] to the rock." He was in the rock. SPEAK
[1:42:46] TO THE ROCK. HE SAID, "IT'LL BRING FORTH
[1:42:48] this waters." He said, "There you are,
[1:42:50] God and his people."
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, SIR.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; God and his people.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; In the book of St. John chapter 14,
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; verse 17,
[1:43:05] the Bible says, "Even the spirit of
[1:43:07] truth whom the world cannot receive
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; because it seeth him not, neither know
[1:43:13] of him." He said, "But ye shall know
[1:43:15] him, for he dwelleth with you."
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; "And shall be in you." Amen.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; And that's what I was talking about
[1:43:20] earlier. If he dwelleth in you, that
[1:43:22] mean you eternally forever in his
[1:43:24] presence.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; And verse 18 say, I will not leave you
[1:43:28] comfortless. I will come to you. Yet a
[1:43:31] little while and the world seeth me no
[1:43:33] more, but you see me.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; He said, because I live, you shall live
[1:43:37] also.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the message fellowship 1960
[1:43:42] paragraph 122 brother but Brenham says
[1:43:46] Jesus once for all one time he was
[1:43:48] perfected forever
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; that's that have come into that
[1:43:52] fellowship with an eternal blessing
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; eternal fellowship with the eternal
[1:43:57] presence of God
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; with the power of the Holy Ghost not in
[1:44:01] a symbol out yonder or in some word or
[1:44:04] in some theology but the Holy Ghost in
[1:44:06] you. He said the power of God that
[1:44:09] raised Christ from the grave is made
[1:44:10] alive in you
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; and you are a new creature
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; then you are a son and daughter of God
[1:44:17] oh brother that's it he said and it
[1:44:20] takes the blood of Jesus Christ to stare
[1:44:22] it takes the power the life that was in
[1:44:24] that blood sir in the book of Ephesians
[1:44:28] chapter 3 verse 20 he says it says now
[1:44:33] unto him that is able to do is seeding
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; that's
[1:44:38] abundantly
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; above all THAT WE ASK OR THINK.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; ACCORDING TO THE POWER THAT WORKKETH in
[1:44:44] us,
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; it say unto him be glory in the church
[1:44:47] by Christ Jesus throughout all ages,
[1:44:50] world without end. Amen.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; To him that is that is able to do
[1:44:56] exceedingly abundantly. Yes, sir.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; So he he's telling you what he's able to
[1:44:59] do. He's he's exceedingly and he can he
[1:45:02] can do it abundantly
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; ABOVE ALL THAT YOU CAN ask for. Amen.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; And and and we we know the scripture
[1:45:09] mean that mean you can't even think of
[1:45:11] nothing
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; that he can't exceed.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; So whatever you can grasp your mind on
[1:45:16] tonight, God said he can go higher than
[1:45:18] that.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; SO WHY WHY WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO SPEAK
[1:45:21] TONIGHT?
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Why wouldn't you want to speak in the
[1:45:23] presence of GOD TO A GOD LIKE THAT THAT
[1:45:25] TELLS YOU THAT WHATEVER YOU ASK FOR
[1:45:27] TONIGHT THAT HE CAN exceed that.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; SO SO YOU MIGHT ASK FOR A LITTLE PORTION
[1:45:32] BUT GOD MAY GIVE YOU DOUBLE.
[1:45:35] AND SO WE FOUND OUT THAT WHEN ELIJAH
[1:45:36] WHEN ELISHA WAS IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD,
[1:45:39] ELISHA ASKED FOR A DOUBLE PORTION. SO
[1:45:41] NOW THAT I LOOK IN THE SCRIPTURE
[1:45:43] TONIGHT, IF IF ELISHA IS ABLE TO ASK FOR
[1:45:45] A DOUBLE PORTION, THAT MEAN I CAN ASK
[1:45:47] FOR MORE THAN that
[1:45:51] cuz there's no limit.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; ELISHA WAS LED TO ASK FOR A DOUBLE
[1:45:56] PORTION. NOW I ASK YOU A QUESTION
[1:45:58] TONIGHT. WHAT ARE YOU LED TO ASK FOR
[1:45:59] TONIGHT?
[1:46:02] WHAT are you LAYING TO ASK FOR TONIGHT?
[1:46:05] WHAT ARE YOUR HEART TELLING YOU THAT YOU
[1:46:06] CAN HAVE TONIGHT?
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOUR HEART SAYING THAT BELONGS
[1:46:10] TO YOU TONIGHT? I SAY SPEAK THE WORD
[1:46:12] TONIGHT. You speak what you need
[1:46:14] tonight.
[1:46:18] GOD GOD IS DOING SOMETHING RIGHT NOW.
[1:46:20] AND WE WE GOT TO GET TO THIS LEVEL. WE
[1:46:23] GOT TO GET TO THIS THIRD PULL LEVEL.
[1:46:25] THERE'S NO COINCIDENCE THAT GOD IS KEEP
[1:46:27] TALKING ABOUT THE third pull. THAT MEANS
[1:46:30] SOMEBODY IT'S TIME FOR SOMEBODY TO SHIFT
[1:46:31] GEARS. IT'S TIME FOR SOMEBODY TO PUT
[1:46:34] THEIR FAITH INTO ACTION. IT'S TIME FOR
[1:46:37] SOMEBODY TO TAKE GOD AT HIS WORD.
[1:46:43] IT WE ARE THE BRIDE OF CHRIST. WE THE
[1:46:46] ONLY ONE THAT CAN TAP INTO THIS.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; SO GOD GOT ANGRY. GOD GOT ANGRY WITH
[1:46:54] Moses
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; when they came back to the rock
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; and and and Moses went to crying and
[1:47:00] complaining because the children of
[1:47:02] Israel wanted something to drink again
[1:47:04] and brother Bren say you would have
[1:47:06] think
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; that the children of Israel would have
[1:47:08] mentioned to Moses say why don't you
[1:47:10] just speak
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; to the rock BECAUSE YOU DONE DID ALL
[1:47:12] THESE SIGNS why don't you just speak to
[1:47:14] the rock
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; but the truth is they couldn't go no
[1:47:17] further than what it was being led
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; see everything that Moses did down in
[1:47:21] Egypt Moses spoke spoke what God told
[1:47:24] him to speak.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; There's a difference.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; There's a difference. God spoke to
[1:47:30] Moses.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; And Moses delivered to Aaron.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; But the original voice came from God
[1:47:36] himself.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; So this is a change of the ministry for
[1:47:40] Moses.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; So So Moses was sitting there waiting on
[1:47:45] God.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; And brother Bren say he KNOW GOD JUST
[1:47:48] PROBABLY GOT FED UP WITH MOSES. He say,
[1:47:50] "Why is you crying and complaining? Why
[1:47:52] don't you just speak to the rock?
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; But but the truth is THAT WAS A CHANGE
[1:47:59] in Moses ministry. That was something
[1:48:02] new to Moses. Moses was JUST REPEATING
[1:48:05] WHAT GOD SAID. BUT NOW GOD IS GOD IS
[1:48:07] SAYING, "I WANT YOU TO JUST SPEAK TO IT.
[1:48:10] YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME to me no more,
[1:48:11] Moses. YOU DON'T HAVE TO SPIKE THE ROCK
[1:48:14] WITH THE ROD NO MORE, MOSES. ALL FROM
[1:48:16] HERE ON OUT, MOSES. ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS
[1:48:18] JUST SPEAK TO THE ROCK, MOSES.
[1:48:24] [Music]
[1:48:26] AMEN. SO, so we look and and and even
[1:48:29] with sickness and and things, we we we
[1:48:31] change ministry with with how we look at
[1:48:34] things and how we handle it. That's
[1:48:35] right.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; If if if we go to the doctor and the
[1:48:38] doctor says, "You got this problem, you
[1:48:40] got that problem, we're going to have to
[1:48:41] do surgery."
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; And and
[1:48:47] that's not the way it got to go. I mean,
[1:48:50] just because he say you got to have
[1:48:52] surgery don't mean it got TO GO OUT THAT
[1:48:54] WAY.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; SO, so I'm like I'm thinking ABOUT
[1:48:58] JOSHUA WHEN HE WAS IN THE BATTLE.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; And Joshua say he had a battle to fight
[1:49:03] and he had a battle to win.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; SO JOSHUA DIDN'T JOSHUA DIDN'T PRAY TO
[1:49:07] GOD.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO PRAY TO GOD. HE
[1:49:10] DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO FAST. SO, SO I'M
[1:49:12] THINKING IN JOSHUA MIND AT SOME POINT
[1:49:15] JOSHUA HAD TO SAY WITHIN HIMSELF, WHAT
[1:49:18] DO I have need of right now?
[1:49:22] WHAT DO I HAVE NEED OF RIGHT NOW IN THE
[1:49:24] MIDST OF this battle? And when JOSHUA
[1:49:26] BEGAN TO THINK ON THESE THINGS, WHAT DO
[1:49:29] I HAVE NEED OF? I SEE THE SUN IS GOING
[1:49:31] DOWN AND THIS BATTLE IS NOT OVER WITH. I
[1:49:34] NEED MORE DAYLIGHT.
[1:49:37] HE BEGAN TO THINK WHAT HE NEEDED TO WIN
[1:49:39] THE BATTLE.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; AND BUTTER AND BUTTER SAY SOMETIMES YOU
[1:49:43] CAN JUST SAY THE RIGHT THING.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; HE SAID SOMETIMES YOU CAN JUST SAY THE
[1:49:47] RIGHT THING and and it would trigger God
[1:49:49] to come ON THE SCENE LIKE HAD IT RIGHT.
[1:49:51] SHE SAID THE RIGHT THING. HE SAID he
[1:49:53] said then Joshua just begin to speak to
[1:49:56] the son. HE SAID SON STAND STILL AND SAY
[1:49:59] NOT ONLY JUST STAND STILL BUT HE looked
[1:50:00] back at the moon and say you stay WHERE
[1:50:02] YOU AT. SEE, JOSHUA BEGAN TO SPEAK
[1:50:05] BECAUSE HE KNOW WHAT HE had need of.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; AND WHY? WHAT LED UP TO him beginning to
[1:50:12] speak like that? Because Joshua know
[1:50:13] that God made him a promise. He knew
[1:50:16] that the pro that that land was over
[1:50:17] there flowing with milk and honey. And
[1:50:19] he knew that God was going to take him
[1:50:21] over there.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; But catch the concept. At some point in
[1:50:26] that in that battle, Joshua had to
[1:50:27] think, "What do I need?" Right.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; So I ask you tonight, what you what do
[1:50:31] you need tonight?
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; What do you have need of?
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THAT'S WHERE IT ALL STARTS AT.
[1:50:39] WHAT DO YOU HAVE NEED OF?
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; And then once you can LAY THAT OUT
[1:50:43] BEFORE GOD AND THEN you can begin to
[1:50:45] speak that whatever it is you need to
[1:50:48] make THAT THING COME TO PASS,
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; THEN YOU BEGIN TO move things, YOU GOT
[1:50:52] THE POWER TO MOVE THINGS OUT OF THE WAY.
[1:50:54] [Applause]
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; I call I call it customization. You can
[1:50:58] customize.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE YOUR DELIVERANCE.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE YOUR DELIVERANCE.
[1:51:11] I DON'T CARE HOW SO AND SO GOT
[1:51:13] DELIVERED. I DON'T CARE HOW THIS BROTHER
[1:51:14] GOT DELIVERED, BUT I CAN CUSTOMIZE MY
[1:51:16] OWN DELIVERANCE.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; If the IF THE DOCTOR SAY I GOT TO HAVE
[1:51:22] SURGERY, I CAN CUSTOM I CAN MOVE THAT
[1:51:24] THING AROUND.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; SAY NO, I CAN BE HEALED WITHOUT SURGERY.
[1:51:27] AMEN.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; If if you need if you need anything from
[1:51:35] God and sickness, LIKE I CHALLENGE YOU
[1:51:37] TONIGHT. IF YOU NEED A A new heart
[1:51:39] tonight, if you need a new kidney
[1:51:41] tonight,
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE WHAT IT IS YOU NEED.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN BEGIN TO CUSTOMIZE THAT THING.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; You You CAN BEGIN TO CUSTOMIZE IT.
[1:51:56] MY BIBLE TELL ME THAT GOD SAID HE WILL
[1:51:59] RESTORE.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; SO WHO SAID YOU GOT TO GO THROUGH
[1:52:04] SURGERY? GOD PROMISED RESTORATION.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; SO I BELIEVE
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; THAT GOD CAN TAKE THAT SAME KIDNEY.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; GOD CAN TAKE THAT SAME HEART AND BEGIN
[1:52:17] TO RESTORE.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; It's what you believe tonight.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; It's what you believe tonight.
[1:52:26] IT'S WHAT YOU BELIEVE tonight
[1:52:28] [Music]
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; there. THERE THERE'S NO BLUEPRINT WHEN
[1:52:34] IT COME DOWN TO YOU AND YOUR LIFE WITH
[1:52:36] GOD. EVERYBODY EVERYBODY EXPERIENCE WITH
[1:52:39] GOD IS DIFFERENT.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; SO THERE SO DON'T DON'T FOCUS ON WHAT
[1:52:43] GOING ON WITH EVERYBODY ELSE. You look
[1:52:45] down in your heart AND YOU ASK YOURSELF
[1:52:46] WHAT IT IS THAT YOU NEED. WHAT do you
[1:52:49] need GOD TO DO? HOW YOU NEED GOD to do
[1:52:52] it? when you need God to do it AND YOU
[1:52:55] BEGIN TO SPEAK OFF OF THAT. YOU BEGIN TO
[1:52:57] SPEAK IT OUT THERE.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; SPEAK IT OUT THERE. PUT IT OUT THERE.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; PUT IT OUT THERE.
[1:53:06] [Applause]
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; There's benefits being in the presence
[1:53:20] of God.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Yeah.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we don't take advantage of
[1:53:24] it.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; You in you're in his presence right now.
[1:53:27] Every time you you walk in here, you you
[1:53:29] walk into his presence and and and we

[1:53:41] that inspiration strikes you,
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHEN YOU LAY IT OUT.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; BROTHER B SAID, "WHEN THAT inspiration
[1:53:47] hit you, that's when YOU SAY THE RIGHT
[1:53:49] THING. AMEN.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHEN YOU SPEAK THE RIGHT THING.
[1:53:53] And then IT THEN IT'LL HAPPEN JUST LIKE

[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you,
[1:54:05] Lord.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; In the book of Mark,
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; chapter 11,
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; yes, sir. Verse 23.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; The Bible say, "For verily I say unto
[1:54:14] you,
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; that whosoever
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; shall say unto this mountain,
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; be thou removed
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; be removed,
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; and be thou cast into the sea,
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; AND SHALL NOT DOUBT
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; IN HIS HEART,
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; BUT SHALL believe that those THINGS
[1:54:29] WHICH HE SAYING SHALL COME TO PASS."
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; He said, HE SHALL HAVE WHATSOEVER HE
[1:54:34] SAITH.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "THEREFORE I SAY UNTO YOU,
[1:54:39] YEAH.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; WHAT THINGS SOEVER YOU DESIRE?
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; I ASK YOU THAT TONIGHT. WHAT THINGS THAT
[1:54:44] YOU DESIRE TONIGHT?
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; What do you desire tonight?
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; He said, "WHEN YOU PRAY, BELIEVE THAT
[1:54:51] YOU RECEIVE them
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; and you shall have them."
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; In the message, Conference with God.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; 1959, paragraph 101.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "That's what's
[1:55:06] the matter with the church today."
[1:55:08] HE SAID GOD CALLS you and he wants to
[1:55:11] give you a gift after gift
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; and power after power
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; and grace after grace.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; He said but you organize yourself then.
[1:55:19] He said I CAN'T GO ANY FURTHER.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; He said but he said BECAUSE THE CHURCH
[1:55:23] WON'T let me see. He said there's no
[1:55:25] halting place in God.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; No place for denomination. He said
[1:55:30] there's no place for any certain
[1:55:32] standard. He said the thing of IT IS IS
[1:55:35] GO FORWARD. HE SAID, "SPEAKS GOD WORD
[1:55:38] AND GO FORWARD."
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "JUST KEEP ON GOING.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; Keep moving." HE SAID, "GOD SAYS IT
[1:55:44] RIGHT. IT'S RIGHT."
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "YOU GOT YOUR COMMISSION." So
[1:55:47] the B commission is just to speak the
[1:55:49] word and move forward.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; That's all you obligated to do tonight
[1:55:54] is just speak the word and move forward.
[1:55:58] [Music]
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that WAS THE THAT THAT'S ALL
[1:56:06] GOD WAS trying to tell Moses in his
[1:56:08] ministry. He went down there with the
[1:56:10] signs. But eventually after a certain
[1:56:13] period of time, God had to change the
[1:56:15] music seat.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; He's like, "I can't let you stay here.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; You you you must go higher."
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; Because because to get raptured in faith
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; and to get in the position for you to be
[1:56:25] in your um positionally placed,
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; then you got to tap into this.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; And and and all it is is you knowing who
[1:56:32] you are. knowing that the same God
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; that split the Red Sea that he lives in
[1:56:38] you.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; And that's what God was telling Moses.
[1:56:40] No longer that you have to come to me
[1:56:42] and ask me to do this thing. I'm trying
[1:56:43] to get you to understand that I am in
[1:56:46] you.
[1:56:48] [Applause]
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; Now I'm looking through the through the
[1:56:59] message now. Even even the prophet even
[1:57:02] brother Brennham say he struggled with
[1:57:04] this scripture.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; Even brother Brandham said he struggled
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; with with this scripture.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm trying to I'm trying to skip
[1:57:15] the same time.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; Oh man.
[1:57:24] as uh
[1:57:28] in the message my new ministry
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; brother Bernham says
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; he said blessed be the kingdom of our
[1:57:36] father David that cometh in the name of
[1:57:38] the Lord hosana in the highest
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; he said and Jesus entered into Jerusalem
[1:57:43] and into the temple and when he had
[1:57:45] looked around upon all things and now
[1:57:48] evening time was come he went out into
[1:57:50] Bethany
[1:57:51] with his 12. He said, "And on the
[1:57:54] tomorrow when they would come to
[1:57:55] Bethany, he was hungry,
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; and he seen a fig tree fall off having
[1:58:00] leaves.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; He came if happily he might he might
[1:58:05] find anything there on
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; and when he came to it, he found nothing
[1:58:09] but leaves,
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; for the time of figs was not yet."
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; So Jesus answered and said unto him, "No
[1:58:14] man eatth fruit of thee hereafter
[1:58:17] forever."
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; And his disciples heard it. He's saying
[1:58:20] they came to Jerusalem and Jesus went
[1:58:21] into the temple and began to cast out
[1:58:24] them that sold and bought in the temple
[1:58:25] and overthrow the tables of the money
[1:58:27] changers and the seats of them that sold
[1:58:29] does. And he says it will not suffer
[1:58:32] that any man should carry any vessel
[1:58:34] through the temple. He said and he
[1:58:36] taught saying unto them, "Is it not
[1:58:38] written, my house shall be called of all
[1:58:40] nations, no the house of prayer?" He
[1:58:42] said, "But you have made it a den of
[1:58:44] thieves." He say, "And the scribes and
[1:58:46] the chief priests heard it and sought
[1:58:47] how they might destroy him, for they
[1:58:49] feared him because all were astonished
[1:58:54] at his doctrine."
[1:58:56] And we going, we're going to go down,
[1:58:59] skip down to when he says, he says, "For
[1:59:02] verily I," he he read the scripture. He
[1:59:04] said ver for verily I say unto you that
[1:59:06] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[1:59:08] be thou be thou removed and be thou cast
[1:59:11] into the sea and shall not doubt in his
[1:59:13] heart but shall believe that those
[1:59:15] things which he saith shall come to pass
[1:59:17] he shall have whatsoever he said
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; therefore I say unto you what things
[1:59:22] soever you desire when you pray believe
[1:59:24] that you receive them and you shall have
[1:59:26] them
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; now brother Benham say what a gracious
[1:59:28] promise
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; he said and it is absolutely the truth
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; absolutely
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; now listen what Butter Ber say Ber say
[1:59:35] this stumped in me.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God say this scripture
[1:59:38] stumped him.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; He said for as I shall use that
[1:59:42] expression for a long time. He say how
[1:59:44] could that be?
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; He said one time when I first started
[1:59:48] preaching here at the tabernacle many
[1:59:50] years ago. He said he said I run into
[1:59:52] the word of hell. He said I run into the
[1:59:55] reference to it many times and I
[1:59:57] referred to the Hades and the Greek
[1:59:59] which meant the grave. He said I don't
[2:00:01] know what to say. He said, "Because I do
[2:00:03] not want to be responsible for men's
[2:00:05] souls at the day of the judgment." He
[2:00:07] said, "So I searched it and I searched
[2:00:09] until I found that it was just the
[2:00:11] truth." He said, "About four or five
[2:00:13] years, I would not touch that subject of
[2:00:15] hell until I found what was the truth
[2:00:18] about."
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; He said, "And then this scripture
[2:00:21] stumped me."
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; He said, "Even more because I was
[2:00:24] outstanding such a promise. It was an
[2:00:26] outstanding promise." He said, "Being
[2:00:28] made by one other than Jesus Christ." He
[2:00:30] said, "And when he had said to his
[2:00:32] disciples, what things soever you say
[2:00:35] you can have," he said, "If thou shall
[2:00:37] say to this mountain, be plucked up and
[2:00:38] removed into the sea, and will not doubt
[2:00:41] in your heart, but shall believe that
[2:00:43] what you have said will come to pass."
[2:00:45] He said, "You can have what you said."
[2:00:47] And brother Bren say, "Oh, oh, if we
[2:00:49] could weigh those words,"
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; he said, "You can have what you say."
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now what I say, not what I
[2:00:56] say, but what you have said." He said
[2:00:59] you can have what you say.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; And brother Bernham say for years
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; he say I lingered over that. That's
[2:01:05] right.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; He said I went to every Lexon commentary
[2:01:08] every translation. He says even to the
[2:01:11] Dewey version he says and every
[2:01:13] translator translates it the same. He
[2:01:15] said you can have what you say.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; He say so I know if it's written in the
[2:01:20] scripture
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; to me. He said all scripture is true. He
[2:01:24] said, HE SAID, "IF I CAN'T RIGHTLY
[2:01:26] DIVIDE IT, it's still the truth."
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; So even if you don't believe it or not,
[2:01:32] it's still the truth.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; If you don't believe that you can have
[2:01:35] what you say you want tonight OR NOT,
[2:01:37] IT'S STILL THE TRUTH.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; That's what Butter Brenam is saying. He
[2:01:44] He's saying IT'S STILL THE GOD WORD IS
[2:01:46] STILL THE TRUTH.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; But it's only true to you if you can
[2:01:49] take hold of it and believe
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; and have faith in it.
[2:01:54] So butter benom believe he at one point
[2:01:57] he struggled with that scripture sir
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; that you can have whatever it is that
[2:02:00] you say
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; he he he he he struggled with that
[2:02:04] before the atonement he got that down in
[2:02:06] there he said he could he struggled with
[2:02:07] that because he looked on the other side
[2:02:09] of the atonement and he noticed that
[2:02:11] disciples were doing these things say
[2:02:13] but he came to a realization that it was
[2:02:16] God in God was stepping inside that body
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; and it wasn't him speaking
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; THAT IT WAS GOD SPEAKING
[2:02:24] And he SAY GOD GOD DEALT WITH HIM with
[2:02:26] that for a while. And he say and and he
[2:02:28] said he his first part of his ministry
[2:02:30] he came to pray for the sick
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; and he he began to do those same two
[2:02:34] signs that Moses had on the mountain.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; Same two signs. He said God spoke to him
[2:02:40] out of a bush. When he was in the woods
[2:02:42] he said God spoke to him out of bush.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; And when God spoke to him out of the
[2:02:45] bush the same thing that God did. He's
[2:02:47] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[2:02:50] When he spoke to him, he gave him a
[2:02:51] scripture. A voice came out and it was a
[2:02:54] scripture that he quoted.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; Say what it is. He said, "Ask whatever
[2:02:57] you need." He quoted that scripture to
[2:02:59] brother Banner.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; And brother Brener knew that it was him
[2:03:01] because the scripture that he quoted was
[2:03:03] in the scriptures.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; And he and brother Bham said he began to
[2:03:07] look over his ministry and he asked God
[2:03:09] and say, "Are you getting ready to
[2:03:10] change my ministry?"
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; He said, "Are you getting ready to
[2:03:13] change my ministry?"
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; And and and you know the story. From
[2:03:16] there on out, God began to deal with him
[2:03:18] and he began to speak.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; He began to speak.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; I think the first time is um God told
[2:03:25] him to um there was going to be a
[2:03:26] resurrection of a of a small animal
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; and he told him to speak to the fish,
[2:03:31] little fish. And from there, he went to
[2:03:33] speak to squirrels into existence.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; So God was changing his ministry.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; So if you brought to Christ or not,
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; God is going to change your ministry.
[2:03:42] Amen.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; That's what I want. That's what I That's
[2:03:45] what I want to drive tonight. God is
[2:03:47] going to If he hadn't changed it yet,
[2:03:49] you it's impossible for you not to be
[2:03:51] changed. He's going to change it.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; IF YOU HAVE NOT TAPPED INTO THAT,
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; he's going to get you there.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; He's going to get you there.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; You get ready because you got to get
[2:04:06] there
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; because he saw he saw us at this level
[2:04:09] and and we're going to get there.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Y'all bless the word. Let's
[2:04:13] stand as we pray. Come on, brother
[2:04:15] Stephen.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; It's benefits in the presence of God.

[2:04:36] Amen.
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; You can't go home like that. You need to
[2:04:41] go home with something.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; The benefit and the change of the
[2:04:47] ministry. Amen.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; This is something whether you believe it
[2:04:51] or not, it's going to happen.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; Uh the bride cannot be 50, 40, 60 years
[2:04:57] like this and keep doing the same thing
[2:05:00] over and over and we keep being cry
[2:05:02] babies and things like that. Uh-uh. It's
[2:05:04] not going to happen. Amen.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. the level God open up the word,
[2:05:09] it's already telling you where God is
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; because the word because the word is the
[2:05:14] measuring thing.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; So when when God open up the word, it
[2:05:18] tells you which level God is moving.
[2:05:20] Amen.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; First pool, how long are you going to
[2:05:24] stay under the first P?
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; They taught brother Brham that his wife
[2:05:31] need to have surgery.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; But brother Brham never stopped praying.
[2:05:36] That's correct.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham never say, "Okay, she's
[2:05:38] going to have a surgery. Let me leave it
[2:05:40] alone." No, Brother Brandham keep
[2:05:42] praying while the date of the surgery
[2:05:44] was approaching.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; The dirt of I mean the date of the
[2:05:49] surgery was approaching and he was
[2:05:51] praying until the inspiration hit him
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; and brother Brandham spoke
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; and when he spoke they took his wife all
[2:05:58] the way to surgery. That's right.
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; They even prepare his wife
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; when they were getting ready
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; to bring the surgical knife. That's when
[2:06:10] God came and removed that thing right
[2:06:14] there.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Because somebody already
[2:06:18] spoke.
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; The doctor can continue to do what they
[2:06:21] want to do all the checkup or the test
[2:06:23] whatever. You hold on to what you spoke
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; and let God meet the doctor somewhere
[2:06:29] and prove to the doctor that he is still
[2:06:32] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[2:06:36] Be ready somehow in your life. There got
[2:06:39] to be a change.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; If you don't know what a change is,
[2:06:44] remember you were a baby.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; And remember, today you're not a baby
[2:06:48] anymore. So something happened to you.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; Maybe you had a little voice, now you
[2:06:52] got a big voice. Something happened to
[2:06:54] you. If you don't understand what a
[2:06:56] change is, look at you today. Many of
[2:06:59] us, we were skinny and everything. Look
[2:07:01] at us today. A change happen. Something
[2:07:04] happened. Whatever something happened.
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; So, whatever, a change will happen.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; So, just be ready for the change. Amen.
[2:07:13] And this is a spiritual change. God is
[2:07:16] getting ready to do something. It's a
[2:07:19] shift in a ministry. Amen.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it tells you how deep you are
[2:07:24] going with God.
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; The deeper you going with God in your
[2:07:28] relationship, the more you're going to
[2:07:29] see God unfold himself in a supernatural
[2:07:32] way. At the beginning, your faith was, I
[2:07:34] need to kneel down a certain way and
[2:07:36] pray, then God will hear me. After a
[2:07:38] while, you don't have a time to kneel.
[2:07:40] You begin to pray. Even though when
[2:07:42] you're driving your car, after a while
[2:07:44] you begin to understand God more and you
[2:07:47] begin to develop an experience or a
[2:07:49] relationship with God where a certain
[2:07:51] point, how are you going to kneel down
[2:07:52] when you're fighting?
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; How are you going to talk to God when
[2:07:57] you're in the midst of the battle?
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; How are you going to do it? Joshua
[2:08:02] didn't have any way to stand there and
[2:08:04] begin to kne the I mean sword and uh and
[2:08:07] uh and arrows are flying every day.
[2:08:10] There is no time to sit down and to look
[2:08:12] for I mean a I'm in a certain uh
[2:08:16] position to start. No, you got to speak
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; and you move on. If you don't want to
[2:08:21] speak, God will push you to a corner
[2:08:23] where you will speak. Where you will sit
[2:08:25] down and you say, "I'm tired of this
[2:08:28] situation. Enough is enough. I'm going
[2:08:30] to speak and then I'm going to believe
[2:08:32] God no matter what happened. I'm going
[2:08:34] to move forward and from this day my
[2:08:36] life is going to change." Amen. Amen.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; This this sermon is too deep than even
[2:08:43] you think.
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah. It came in a different way the way
[2:08:47] God wanted it to come but it's too deep.
[2:08:50] Amen.
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; This can be even apply in the marriages.
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; It can even apply in your life.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; There is a shift that happen in
[2:09:00] marriages.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; But we are usually not aware of it. We
[2:09:05] behaving with our husband like we were
[2:09:07] married with them the way we were
[2:09:09] married 50 years.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; All right, it's time to go home. Amen.
[2:09:18] Amen. Because the woman or the sister
[2:09:21] never understood the shift of the
[2:09:24] ministry.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; The man that you live with him for that
[2:09:28] you live with him for five years is no
[2:09:30] longer the same man.
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; Things have shifted.
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; But you're still living like he was the
[2:09:38] same man.
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; And sometime he shows you sign but you
[2:09:41] still don't catch sign.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; Ah let's go home.
[2:09:55] Amen. We will deal with this one day.
[2:09:57] You will understand the shift of this
[2:09:59] thing in a marriage. And what if if you
[2:10:02] catch the shift,
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; you will begin. You won't have to argue
[2:10:06] with your husband.
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; You don't even have to insist to make
[2:10:11] your point.
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; If you understand the shift,
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; if you understand that this time this
[2:10:17] man has shifted, what our relationship
[2:10:20] have shifted, all you have to say will
[2:10:23] be I wish I have the water of Jerusalem
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; and that's it.
[2:10:31] uh he will be the one pulling the sword
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; and fighting through
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; and they will bring it to you. But you
[2:10:39] don't believe it. You don't even believe
[2:10:40] it yourself first. The problem is you
[2:10:42] don't believe it. You got stuck with my
[2:10:44] husband. Whenever I tell him something,
[2:10:46] he won't do it. You miss the shift.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; You didn't understand. And he's waiting
[2:10:50] for you to
[2:10:53] Men are different.
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. A man will leave $200 because God
[2:11:02] is a man.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; A man will leave $200 on the on the on
[2:11:10] the counter
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; and then when you come you say who is
[2:11:13] this $200? He say it's mine
[2:11:18] and it depends what you're going to do.
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; And it depend on which level of the
[2:11:24] shift you are.
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; One will pick up and say you know what I
[2:11:27] take it. It's mine.
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; And find out if he will come to pick it
[2:11:31] up. He won't. But if you leave that, he
[2:11:34] will take it.
[2:11:37] [Music]
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; All right, let's go home.
[2:11:41] If you leave it right there, he will
[2:11:43] take it back and he will find a bill to
[2:11:45] pay.
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; But if you take it, he won't come back
[2:11:50] to you and say, "Get it."
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; Because he's already aware that you're
[2:11:55] the one that took it.
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And sometime he did it
[2:11:58] purposely. And God does the same thing.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; He walk with you on Emas and he act like
[2:12:05] he's gone.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; Is up to you to understand and say,
[2:12:10] "Hey,
[2:12:12] he told them he's leaving."
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; But so when they told him when they
[2:12:16] constrained him stay, why did he say if
[2:12:18] he was going?
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm asking you a question. Why did
[2:12:21] he stay?
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; He said he was leaving.
[2:12:25] So why did God stay when they constrain
[2:12:27] him? He should have said, "No, no, no.
[2:12:29] Me, God, when I speak, I don't take my
[2:12:31] word back. I'm God.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; You see now, you see now,
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; you see now understand this. Put that in
[2:12:40] the spiritual level and you will see
[2:12:42] what God want."
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; We want God to push every button for us
[2:12:47] and we will be a lazy people sitting can
[2:12:50] do nothing. God is standing waiting on
[2:12:52] you until you understand that you need
[2:12:54] to put your hand and take what belongs
[2:12:56] to you and walk out. And when you do
[2:12:58] that, you will hear God clapping hands
[2:13:00] say finally they understood what I was
[2:13:03] trying to say. For five, six years, I
[2:13:06] was trying to tell them they can do this
[2:13:08] themselves. They don't understand.
[2:13:09] That's the reason why Brandham say God
[2:13:12] got angry toward Moses. That's right.
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; A prophet that come to ask for help and
[2:13:16] God is yelling at the prophet. Why?
[2:13:19] because he keep doing things, keep doing
[2:13:21] things and he thought okay this time
[2:13:23] Moses will understand that he doesn't
[2:13:25] need to come back because he already did
[2:13:26] so many miracle he doesn't need to ask
[2:13:29] me and Moses keep coming back but keep
[2:13:30] coming I say the only way he can
[2:13:32] understand is a yet he yell at Moses and
[2:13:34] Moses say oh so what should I do he say
[2:13:37] what do you ask me you need to do you
[2:13:39] already know what to do this is where we
[2:13:41] are now this is where we getting with
[2:13:44] God is going to hand everything back he
[2:13:47] already delivered the faith
[2:13:50] God is handing everything back to you
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; to do what you got to do.
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; You know what the word of God say? Do do
[2:14:00] it.
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; Don't sit there and say okay let me hear
[2:14:03] that voice. When that voice will say go
[2:14:05] and I will go. There is a time you have
[2:14:08] to do that. After a while you already
[2:14:10] understand God is with me. My husband
[2:14:12] love me. I know that he love me. I know
[2:14:15] that this is my husband. He's not going
[2:14:17] nowhere. I don't have to do anything.
[2:14:19] All I have to do in shoot a text and
[2:14:22] say, "Bring me Chick-fil-A." And that's
[2:14:24] it.
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's a Oh. Oh, don't worry. Don't
[2:14:30] worry. You will understand me later. I'm
[2:14:32] somewhere ahead of you. You will
[2:14:34] understand me later. If you begin to do
[2:14:36] that, you will see. Even if he say
[2:14:40] now there's traffic on the road, before
[2:14:42] you know it, Chick-fil-A
[2:14:44] the re what what is pushing Chick-fil-A?
[2:14:47] It's not you. Your marriage already
[2:14:50] changed. That man have you in his mind.
[2:14:54] God have you in his mind.
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; God is thinking about you. God is
[2:14:59] watching over you. God is caring for
[2:15:02] you. God is with you. Everywhere you
[2:15:04] going, it is God.
[2:15:07] [Applause]
[2:15:09] Don't suffer like a woman that doesn't
[2:15:11] have a head
[2:15:15] &gt;&gt; because we got our head. A head that
[2:15:18] will never divorce you.
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; It is God. You married eternally with
[2:15:22] him.
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; Take that to a spiritual level. You will
[2:15:25] see exactly what God is trying to say.
[2:15:27] Amen.
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; He's not there somebody who's holding
[2:15:30] things for you and let you suffer and he
[2:15:32] see suffer. A normal man will not even
[2:15:35] do that. And God say if we who are bad
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; evil we know how to good give good give
[2:15:42] to our children.
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; So the way we behaving we make God look
[2:15:46] even bad.
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; Like a man who's making his people
[2:15:49] suffering. No the problem is us.
[2:15:52] Understand the shift in the ministry.
[2:15:54] You've been in this message for so long.
[2:15:57] God has already been shifting in your
[2:15:59] life. It is up to you to catch up to the
[2:16:02] shift and behave accordingly. Let's
[2:16:05] pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we are
[2:16:07] approaching you humbly tonight. Father,
[2:16:10] thanking you for your grace, your love,
[2:16:12] your mercy, and for speaking to us
[2:16:14] tonight. Father, I pray that you bring a
[2:16:17] special revelation so that each one of
[2:16:20] us both invisible and visible audience
[2:16:24] can realize who we are in your eyes
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; and the way you are looking in us. And
[2:16:30] once that revelation struck our heart,
[2:16:34] We won't even have a trouble
[2:16:37] asking you something and we would never
[2:16:40] look at our trial and our difficulties
[2:16:42] the same way. Father, you are shifting
[2:16:45] ministry. The hour is late. You changing
[2:16:48] ministry all over the world. We can see
[2:16:51] what is happening all over the broad.
[2:16:54] There is a new surge of energy that have
[2:16:57] come and it's pushing the word with such
[2:17:00] a powerful anointing all over the world
[2:17:03] because the ministry have changed. The
[2:17:06] time have changed. The people need a
[2:17:09] real and a true God. A living God that
[2:17:12] can walk in the midst of them that can
[2:17:15] do things for them. That can deliver
[2:17:17] them that can be a reality to their
[2:17:20] life. So that that will boost the for a
[2:17:23] a a I mean a faith in a higher level
[2:17:26] until rapturing faith will be so simple
[2:17:30] to grasp and to understand that for
[2:17:32] truth we will change and we will be
[2:17:34] transformed. If God can make it cancer
[2:17:37] disappear I'm no longer will doubt of a
[2:17:40] body change. Father, I pray that you
[2:17:43] give that revelation and open up the
[2:17:45] eyes like you did for Ghazi. For those
[2:17:48] that have still blindness in their eyes,
[2:17:51] may their eyes be completely open so
[2:17:54] that we can see where we are and at
[2:17:56] which stage we are in the ministry.
[2:17:58] Father, may you strengthen your man's
[2:18:00] servant that you use tonight. Bless us
[2:18:03] and give us mercy. Lord, we are
[2:18:05] committing the weekend unto the hand.
[2:18:08] Lord remove any evil and bad weather
[2:18:10] away from us. Protect us and protect
[2:18:13] your children father in the name of
[2:18:16] Jesus Christ. Amen.
