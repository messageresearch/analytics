[52:56] following me online impossible for me to
[53:00] attend all of them so we'll try the best
[53:03] that we can so as soon as I got a

[53:07] it to the Deacon so they can post it on
[53:09] the board there and if you got a chance

[54:00] and uh whoever is not here who is uh
[54:05] following me or who will be following
[54:08] later
[54:09] try your best to get into this because I
[54:13] don't have any choice but we gotta turn
[54:15] the corner
[54:17] in other words there is no way if you
[54:19] hear you cannot still study this church
[54:23] would never put you comfortable
[54:25] as soon as you reach a certain level we
[54:27] push you back up again
[54:29] amen and sit as you get to that level
[54:32] you say thank God I'm there before you
[54:34] know it brother Stephen is pushing you
[54:35] back up again
[54:37] amen the end is the rapture when you get
[54:40] into the Rapture then we reach it but as
[54:43] long as we hear the Rapture is not here
[54:45] body will continue to push you back and
[54:48] for keep moving keep moving until we
[54:50] reach the destination amen so if you do
[54:55] not understand what I'm gonna get into
[54:58] it go home
[55:01] review slowly
[55:03] and read the scripture slowly because
[55:06] it's going to help everybody Where We
[55:08] Are
[55:09] depending on your level it will help you
[55:11] out and if you were a minister of the
[55:14] gospel and you ended up getting into
[55:17] this material
[55:19] make sure you look into it and you know
[55:22] my heart
[55:23] I'm not fighting against face and blood
[55:27] I'm fighting against demonic Spirit and
[55:30] the worst one is the religious spirit
[55:33] and usually it's hidden under doctrines
[55:35] and it's holding people hostage and
[55:39] spirit demonic Spirit has been hovering
[55:41] on people's life for years
[55:43] so when I'm moving I'm not against any
[55:46] camp or whatever because I don't even
[55:48] belong to any camp
[55:50] amen I'm inter-denominational
[55:54] in the message I'm not talking about
[55:57] outside in the message I'm into
[55:58] denomination
[56:00] in either way that you won't find me in
[56:02] any camper the only Camp you find me is
[56:05] the word of God so I'm free to deliver
[56:07] whatever the Lord put in my heart
[56:10] so if you don't understand this before
[56:12] you start fighting slow down
[56:16] listen correctly my way of speaking is
[56:18] direct I'm not a politician listen
[56:21] carefully because I have more than what
[56:24] I'm gonna pull up here
[56:26] so understand my heart
[56:28] but I have no choice I gotta deliver
[56:30] this message and I trust God will help
[56:33] me to reach where I'm trying to reach
[56:36] let's go to a scripture this morning
[56:38] Genesis 22.
[56:44] yeah there is no way I can see people in
[56:46] the bondage and keep my mouth shut
[56:49] thank you
[56:51] anyway if a Ministry can be destroyed by
[56:54] the word it needs to be destroyed
[56:59] if a Ministry can be destroyed by the
[57:01] World by the word that Ministry need to
[57:03] be destroyed because it automatically
[57:06] enter World
[57:09] amen
[57:11] the message is never complicated
[57:14] we twist and do this and this and this
[57:17] until we confuse the people
[57:20] that time is over
[57:23] amen
[57:25] Genesis 22.
[57:28] remember you don't get me please slow
[57:31] down
[57:35] please slow down
[57:39] don't get me wrong
[57:41] slow down
[57:44] please
[57:45] Genesis 22 verse 1.
[57:49] and he came to pass after these things
[57:52] that God
[57:54] detempt
[57:59] I'm reading the Bible it is not me
[58:03] watch out
[58:04] because somewhere they say God Don't
[58:06] Tempt people
[58:09] I'm just reading the Bible
[58:10] [Laughter]
[58:13] in other words God test
[58:16] God test or tempt Abraham and say to him
[58:22] Abraham not Abraham Abraham
[58:27] and he said behold here I am so the one
[58:31] who initiated the test is God
[58:35] you might be seated
[58:37] the one who initiated the test for job
[58:39] was God
[58:44] so if God start your test
[58:48] is that a problem
[58:50] because who started
[58:54] we can close here and just go home
[58:58] the one who started the test
[59:00] amen
[59:02] he is God himself
[59:04] just like he did for job
[59:07] and he comes Abraham was quiet
[59:11] amen this temptation is not for Abraham
[59:15] to drink whiskey
[59:20] the Temptation Of God it's not for you
[59:23] to fall down
[59:27] God was after something
[59:29] he was not tempting Abraham so Abraham
[59:32] can go commit something wrong or rob a
[59:35] bank that's not it
[59:39] [Laughter]
[59:42] verse 2 and he said
[59:45] if you were here on Wednesday you will
[59:47] understand how what was going on
[59:51] it was like a convention
[59:53] amen
[59:55] and he said
[59:57] take now your son
[59:59] which son your only son
[1:00:03] who Isaac specific
[1:00:05] so there is no more question you say
[1:00:07] okay maybe he was talking about Ishmael
[1:00:10] Isaac amen
[1:00:13] whom you love
[1:00:16] so not something you don't love
[1:00:19] [Music]
[1:00:20] because if you don't love it you give it
[1:00:22] up quickly
[1:00:25] amen
[1:00:26] whom you love and get you into the land
[1:00:30] of Moriah
[1:00:32] this is where the temple was built
[1:00:36] and offer him there for a burnt offering
[1:00:39] upon one of the mountain which I will
[1:00:43] tell you of
[1:00:44] the one who started this is God
[1:00:47] the one who came up with the project is
[1:00:49] God and the one who delivered
[1:00:51] instructions is God and a destruction is
[1:00:54] hard
[1:00:56] it's about going to worship God
[1:00:58] but wakanda worship
[1:01:01] you're going to worship God where God is
[1:01:04] asking you for something that is almost
[1:01:06] impossible for you to give up
[1:01:11] give out Isaac
[1:01:13] so I'm going to worship with my son
[1:01:18] amen
[1:01:20] thank you Jesus
[1:01:22] and Abraham rose up early in the morning
[1:01:25] and sadder Is Us
[1:01:28] and took Sarah
[1:01:36] thank you and took two of his young men
[1:01:40] with him
[1:01:42] and Isaac his son
[1:01:45] and split the wood for the burnt
[1:01:47] offering and Rose up and went to the
[1:01:50] place of which God has told him
[1:01:54] so maybe Sarah is looking at Abraham in
[1:01:56] the morning splitting wood he said oh
[1:01:58] okay maybe they're going with his son uh
[1:02:01] go ahead hang out with your father
[1:02:04] I'm fine so I can take a little break
[1:02:06] here
[1:02:07] didn't know what was going on
[1:02:09] verse 4 then on the third day
[1:02:13] Abraham lift up his eyes and saw the
[1:02:16] place a far off
[1:02:17] and Abraham said to his young men
[1:02:20] so at home he left Sarah
[1:02:24] have to stay home
[1:02:26] but when he reached a certain level he's
[1:02:29] looking at the mountain he looked at the
[1:02:31] two guys he say this is as far as you
[1:02:34] can go
[1:02:35] you stay here
[1:02:37] so everybody is staying according to
[1:02:40] their faith
[1:02:47] Have I Lost somebody
[1:02:50] Have I Lost somebody Sarah have to stay
[1:02:53] home
[1:02:54] Sarah cannot go there
[1:02:59] Sarah home
[1:03:02] amen
[1:03:03] as they move on they reach a point where
[1:03:07] they see more Moriah afarov the two
[1:03:10] servant
[1:03:11] have to stay there
[1:03:13] amen
[1:03:15] here
[1:03:17] amen
[1:03:18] but it's not the place yet
[1:03:22] then Abraham himself
[1:03:25] and Isaac but Isaac now is not Isaac
[1:03:29] Isaac is a sacrifice
[1:03:36] who indicated the sacrifice
[1:03:40] don't do me like this
[1:03:42] we're reading the Bible together so
[1:03:44] Abraham begin to move alone
[1:03:48] with his sacrifice Isaac
[1:03:56] amen
[1:03:57] amen
[1:04:01] verse 5 and Abraham said to this to his
[1:04:06] young man about you here
[1:04:08] you know that Moses did that
[1:04:11] when he was going up the mountain he
[1:04:13] reached a certain prayer he say only
[1:04:15] Joshua can go with me he reached a point
[1:04:17] he said you Josh are you stay here I'm
[1:04:20] gonna move on over there over there is
[1:04:22] when you see God face to face
[1:04:26] amen and Abraham said to his young man
[1:04:29] about you here with the US
[1:04:33] and I and the Lord will go up and will
[1:04:36] go Yonder and do what
[1:04:42] so they were going to worship
[1:04:44] with a test
[1:04:47] you worshiping God under a test
[1:04:54] God is giving you something and he's
[1:04:56] asking you something very high he's
[1:04:58] watching you but it's under worship
[1:05:02] he want to see what you're gonna do
[1:05:04] you will cling to that which you love or
[1:05:07] you're gonna give him the first place
[1:05:10] it's a test in the line of worship
[1:05:14] a test in the line of worship
[1:05:18] amen
[1:05:20] whether you're going to stay ready
[1:05:23] with him in the land of worship he says
[1:05:26] me and the Lord I and the Lord will go
[1:05:29] Yonder and do water
[1:05:32] and do what

[1:05:52] thank you
[1:05:54] amen
[1:05:55] he says and I and the Lord will go
[1:05:59] Yonder and do water
[1:06:01] that's not a problem
[1:06:03] everybody can believe that because
[1:06:06] they're going somewhere and we know the
[1:06:08] worship is one one comeback
[1:06:14] yeah you can worship what you want but
[1:06:16] one one come back but look at the
[1:06:18] problem Kama
[1:06:19] and daughter come again to you
[1:06:24] who told you they're gonna come again
[1:06:30] amen Abraham didn't say I am going to
[1:06:34] worship and I'm going to come back
[1:06:37] Abraham say me and my son
[1:06:41] we too we're going together
[1:06:45] but just know the same way you saw us
[1:06:48] going
[1:06:54] that's the same way you're gonna see us
[1:06:56] coming
[1:06:59] but what is going to happen there will
[1:07:01] take the life of Isaac
[1:07:05] who was talking here
[1:07:09] which Abraham is talking here
[1:07:14] because the normal Abraham knows that
[1:07:16] he's going to slay his son
[1:07:18] but another Abraham begin to talk amen
[1:07:26] amen so he got two Abraham
[1:07:32] we got the outside of Abraham
[1:07:35] and we got the inward the Abraham by the
[1:07:39] Andrew reminded you very well on
[1:07:40] Wednesday we got the inward Abraham amen
[1:07:44] when we reached this point and Abraham
[1:07:48] spoke
[1:07:52] and Abraham said I am going
[1:07:55] and I am coming back with the Sun in
[1:07:58] other words Abraham spoke about the
[1:08:01] resurrection
[1:08:06] everybody okay
[1:08:08] he spoke about the resurrection because
[1:08:10] what he was going to do there was to
[1:08:13] kill Isaac
[1:08:16] he was going to kill Isaac
[1:08:20] amen but he say me and Isaac we're
[1:08:24] coming back in other words somehow
[1:08:28] that I don't know
[1:08:30] God must raise this body
[1:08:35] [Applause]
[1:08:37] we okay
[1:08:38] we Okay we okay
[1:08:41] we good Isaac himself did not even
[1:08:44] understand what Abraham was saying
[1:08:49] this Abraham did not understand what
[1:08:53] Abraham was saying
[1:08:55] [Music]
[1:08:57] this Abraham did not understand what
[1:09:00] Abraham was saying
[1:09:04] maybe if you know they say now you're
[1:09:07] the way you know it now you would say
[1:09:09] poor Abraham
[1:09:12] he's just comforting himself
[1:09:15] amen
[1:09:16] it's word spoken during a painful time
[1:09:22] [Applause]
[1:09:30] did you get my message
[1:09:32] did you get my message
[1:09:33] so when you are squeezed
[1:09:40] when you under desperation
[1:09:43] when we were on a tight corner
[1:09:46] in a very difficult situation
[1:09:50] certain words come out of your mouth
[1:09:55] and they'll usually look impossible
[1:09:58] [Applause]
[1:10:05] it is word that usually comes in tight
[1:10:10] situation
[1:10:14] when you are desperate
[1:10:19] when we are done
[1:10:24] when you are finished
[1:10:28] may not know how
[1:10:37] when you are just giving up
[1:10:43] amen you would deliver a certain world
[1:10:47] word when the word comes up
[1:10:51] you yourself
[1:10:53] you yourself
[1:10:56] because this is in a hope mode
[1:11:01] but this one lays on a faith mode
[1:11:04] you will deliver a certain word
[1:11:07] in other words you are just delivering
[1:11:10] that to God like you know what you do
[1:11:13] what you want
[1:11:17] everybody good
[1:11:19] everybody good
[1:11:20] that's the first thing Abraham spoke
[1:11:24] amen
[1:11:26] let's go to verse six and Abraham took
[1:11:29] the wood
[1:11:30] of the burn offering and laid it upon
[1:11:33] Isaac his son and he took the fire in
[1:11:36] his hand and a knife and they went both
[1:11:38] of them together
[1:11:40] and Isaac spoke
[1:11:42] to Abraham his father and say my father
[1:11:47] and he said here I am my son
[1:11:49] and he said behold the fire the boy is
[1:11:53] looking left and right he doesn't
[1:11:55] understand the equation here
[1:11:58] he said wait a minute here is the fire
[1:12:01] and the wood
[1:12:03] but are not the way we worship
[1:12:06] if we worship with you many times I seen
[1:12:09] you at home the way you worship but this
[1:12:11] kind of worship is strange
[1:12:15] Maybe daddy you missed something did we
[1:12:18] forget something
[1:12:22] so Isaac knew the order of worship amen
[1:12:27] [Applause]
[1:12:30] because Isaac saw his father the way he
[1:12:33] was worshiping
[1:12:36] we change the way you worship God your
[1:12:40] children are watching you
[1:12:44] if you don't pray at home your children
[1:12:46] knows
[1:12:47] and it's going to affect your children
[1:12:50] that's why brother Branham say it is not
[1:12:53] children delinquency but his parents
[1:12:56] delinquency if you train your child the
[1:12:59] correct way
[1:13:00] then somehow your child is watching you
[1:13:03] and when you begin to drift away from
[1:13:06] the word your child can even remind you
[1:13:09] back
[1:13:10] like Daddy you missing something this is
[1:13:14] Wednesday this is Sunday it's time to go
[1:13:17] to church amen because I know that every
[1:13:20] Sunday we go to church every Wednesday
[1:13:22] we go to church every time before we go
[1:13:25] to bed we read the Bible have we
[1:13:28] forgotten something
[1:13:30] [Music]
[1:13:31] that's why God say I know Abraham will
[1:13:35] teach his children
[1:13:36] that's what the Bible says I know
[1:13:39] Abraham will teach his children that's
[1:13:41] why I must unfold everything to Abraham
[1:13:46] so when God open up himself to you he
[1:13:49] trusts you
[1:13:52] [Applause]
[1:13:53] because he know you're gonna do the
[1:13:55] right thing
[1:14:00] you are worthy
[1:14:03] amen
[1:14:04] amen amen glory to God verse 8 and
[1:14:08] Abraham say
[1:14:10] my son
[1:14:11] water will provide himself God will
[1:14:14] provide himself for Land wait a minute
[1:14:17] Isaac say where is the sacrifice
[1:14:20] leading to Abraham know the sacrifice
[1:14:24] God told Abraham the sacrifice he said
[1:14:27] for this worship the sacrifice is Isaac
[1:14:30] why didn't he turn around until uh and
[1:14:33] uh and told Isaac that they sacrifices
[1:14:36] you
[1:14:39] he was not a guessworker we know who's
[1:14:42] going to be slain here we know who's the
[1:14:45] sacrifice but for some reason when
[1:14:47] Abraham turned around
[1:14:49] instead of saying you are the sacrifice
[1:14:52] Abraham releases something
[1:14:56] [Music]
[1:14:58] and what is he releasing
[1:15:01] he say my son God
[1:15:07] will do whatever
[1:15:08] in other words that sacrifice doesn't
[1:15:11] exist I'm happy
[1:15:16] that's why Isaac said where is the
[1:15:18] sacrifice in other words there is no
[1:15:21] sacrifice in that area
[1:15:23] amen Isaac say I'm looking around here I
[1:15:27] don't see any
[1:15:29] I don't see any lamb here I don't see
[1:15:32] anything in this area what is going on
[1:15:34] he said don't worry what you're looking
[1:15:36] for
[1:15:37] God Who provided
[1:15:41] Amen in other words God will created
[1:15:50] because it's not available there
[1:16:01] Jehovah Jireh
[1:16:05] it's a god of the third pool
[1:16:10] go see how many times brother Branham
[1:16:13] preached Jehovah Jireh
[1:16:14] God has many name why did Brother
[1:16:17] Branham stick only on Jehovah
[1:16:25] hard to help me verse eight and Abraham
[1:16:28] said my son God will provide how himself
[1:16:34] not for me
[1:16:36] he's the one that's looking for
[1:16:38] sacrifice
[1:16:39] he himself
[1:16:42] himself
[1:16:45] provide for himself a water
[1:16:50] so there was no lamb there now Abraham
[1:16:53] pushed God to the edge
[1:16:54] God put Abraham to the corner Abraham
[1:16:57] turned around and put God to the corner
[1:17:00] [Music]
[1:17:02] the game changed
[1:17:06] Abraham said I know My Sacrifice

[1:23:50] Abraham have a right to protect the
[1:23:53] promises

[1:34:57] is written our deed water and therefore
[1:35:01] have I spoken we also did water and
[1:35:05] therefore do we do water
[1:35:08] it's in the Bible
[1:35:13] in other words that faith of Abraham is
[1:35:16] just an example but we have the same
[1:35:19] Spirit of Faith just like Abraham spoke
[1:35:23] because he believed we also believe and
[1:35:27] we speak
[1:35:29] because from our mother womb we were
[1:35:31] created like that
[1:35:35] if you go to heaven you have not spoken
[1:35:38] you have not fulfilled your mission yet
[1:35:42] we are not in the age of flute
[1:35:47] Sage the level
[1:35:50] that God is bringing us you must speak
[1:35:54] if you're afraid you can even speak to a
[1:35:57] fish
[1:35:58] come on
[1:36:04] [Music]
[1:36:06] the Bible says this in Mark 11 for
[1:36:10] verily I say unto you that water
[1:36:12] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[1:36:15] be water remove and be that cast into
[1:36:18] water and shall not doubt well in his
[1:36:21] heart but shall believe that those
[1:36:23] things which he say Hussein
[1:36:28] who was talking in Genesis
[1:36:31] Abraham
[1:36:34] amen which he said shall come to pass he
[1:36:38] shall have water
[1:36:40] did they put something there
[1:36:42] specifically
[1:36:44] Abraham in his situation he needed a ram
[1:36:49] I don't need a ram to eat I have some
[1:36:52] other stuff
[1:36:55] [Applause]
[1:36:59] brother Branham was looking for square
[1:37:04] if I don't hunt
[1:37:07] that's why the Bible said whatsoever
[1:37:10] amen
[1:37:12] amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we
[1:37:16] are approaching you humbly again this
[1:37:18] morning Father we thank you once again
[1:37:21] for your grace for your love your mercy

[1:37:35] Omega of this service in the name of

[1:37:40] my subject this morning
[1:37:45] is the four phases of roof
[1:37:49] faith
[1:37:50] in categories
[1:37:53] all levels
[1:37:56] faith in categories
[1:37:59] in other words they are categories of
[1:38:01] faith
[1:38:03] that's why I told you if you don't
[1:38:05] understand you don't understand me go
[1:38:07] back and listen
[1:38:08] they are different categories of faith
[1:38:14] and there are different levels
[1:38:17] of faith
[1:38:19] so we will pick you up wherever you are
[1:38:21] we're gonna pick you up
[1:38:25] if you in one we pick you up if we're in
[1:38:28] two we pick you up we okay amen we okay
[1:38:32] we are still in the four phases of roof
[1:38:36] part 85.
[1:38:40] there is enough
[1:38:43] everybody okay in the Tabernacle we are
[1:38:46] in roof before she departs from the
[1:38:48] earth we must reach a certain level you
[1:38:51] don't leave the earth going just like
[1:38:53] that we must reach certain level last
[1:38:55] Sunday we read this code Brother Branham
[1:38:58] say so hold
[1:39:01] hold the key
[1:39:03] comma what is the key faith in the word
[1:39:07] if you notice that faith is not in a man
[1:39:14] amen
[1:39:16] it is not the faith in a man
[1:39:20] it is not a faith that is in the church
[1:39:25] it is not the faith that is in the
[1:39:28] organization it is a faith that is in
[1:39:31] the world
[1:39:33] and the word of God the Bible say heaven
[1:39:35] and earth will pass away but the world
[1:39:39] will remain forever
[1:39:42] and faith in that word is the key
[1:39:47] what are you talking about brother
[1:39:48] Branham brother Branham saying and every
[1:39:52] bit of faith that you believe
[1:39:54] and don't doubt one spec
[1:39:57] you can do water unlock every door you
[1:40:00] can unlock water
[1:40:02] not some door
[1:40:04] in other words it's one kid that work in
[1:40:07] every door amen
[1:40:13] you can unlock every door that stand
[1:40:17] between you
[1:40:22] and the water
[1:40:24] the blessing that God has water for you
[1:40:27] so there is a blessing that God have for
[1:40:30] you and there is you in between you and
[1:40:33] the blessing there is a door there is an
[1:40:35] obstacle there is something that is
[1:40:38] preventing you from reaching what
[1:40:41] belonged to you that's right
[1:40:43] what God has for you he already found
[1:40:46] you worthy to receive it
[1:40:50] everybody okay but to remove the
[1:40:53] obstacle brother Branham say You must
[1:40:56] have the key and the key is faith in the
[1:40:59] word that's right
[1:41:02] brother brand I'm saying may God help us
[1:41:05] to have the keys is my prayer
[1:41:09] amen
[1:41:10] brother Branham says this he says
[1:41:13] I wish to read just the first tonight
[1:41:15] out of second Corinthians the fourth
[1:41:17] chapter the 18th verse while we look not
[1:41:20] at the things which are sin
[1:41:24] my subject tonight is looking at the
[1:41:27] Unseen
[1:41:29] we are told that we have an outward man
[1:41:34] and an inward man
[1:41:37] the outward man look by his eyes
[1:41:43] we okay
[1:41:44] and the inward men walk by faith in
[1:41:48] other words he doesn't use your eyes
[1:41:49] that's right amen
[1:41:51] so we have to be led by one of these two
[1:41:55] persons
[1:41:56] outside out on man is who so
[1:42:00] inward man is who
[1:42:05] [Applause]
[1:42:08] can you see clear
[1:42:09] can you see clear can you see clear my
[1:42:13] brother over there makes you a please
[1:42:15] the the this court stayed there
[1:42:18] the inward man is who
[1:42:23] the inward man in you is God whether you
[1:42:27] don't want to believe it that's fine but
[1:42:29] it's God
[1:42:31] because who else can create
[1:42:35] so if Abraham spoke and something was
[1:42:38] created who was creating God in who
[1:42:41] Abraham
[1:42:45] everybody good brother Branham say the
[1:42:49] inward man is who
[1:42:51] you see we do not see with our eyes
[1:42:54] though many times we thought that we saw
[1:42:56] with our eyes we only look with our eyes
[1:43:00] we see with our heart
[1:43:03] are we okay
[1:43:04] are we okay your eyes only gather
[1:43:07] information
[1:43:10] but somebody need to interpret the
[1:43:12] information and say that is brother
[1:43:14] so-and-so amen everybody okay glory to
[1:43:18] God brother Branham says this he says
[1:43:21] here it is watch and if God if you are
[1:43:25] enough swing of him and God is in you
[1:43:30] he will believe his own word that's
[1:43:32] right that's right
[1:43:37] question who is believing ahead of the
[1:43:40] word god way
[1:43:43] [Music]
[1:43:45] if God believe his word
[1:43:49] is it going to happen or it won't happen
[1:43:54] 100 bullseye
[1:43:58] because it's not you
[1:44:00] it is God so God in you and God
[1:44:03] believing his own word amen
[1:44:09] amen amen
[1:44:11] no problem my friend he says though he
[1:44:15] can be seen
[1:44:19] anything You Shall Believe It
[1:44:23] because the one who's believing it is
[1:44:25] not you
[1:44:26] that's right
[1:44:30] you see what I mean for God in you will
[1:44:34] believe his own
[1:44:41] I'm standing Assad so you don't say that
[1:44:43] I was blocking
[1:44:45] amen is that right congregation says
[1:44:48] water amen
[1:44:49] then you don't look at things you see
[1:44:54] you look at things that God said
[1:44:57] [Music]
[1:45:00] amen
[1:45:03] in other words when God already believes
[1:45:06] his word for you don't trouble him
[1:45:11] don't disturb God by your unbelief
[1:45:16] because God is saying it is for you you
[1:45:18] look you say I'm not worthy
[1:45:20] that's why he dealt with you on
[1:45:22] Wednesday but worthiness that's right
[1:45:24] because we too humble in this message we
[1:45:27] are always not worthy that's why he took
[1:45:30] the false humility out
[1:45:31] [Applause]
[1:45:33] Ernie
[1:45:36] not worthy on ourself Worthy on the road
[1:45:40] because of what he did on Calvary
[1:45:44] amen
[1:45:46] that's why Paul said I boast in the Lord
[1:45:50] [Music]
[1:45:52] bursting in the Lord is not boasting in
[1:45:55] me it is a burst of faith
[1:45:58] [Applause]
[1:46:02] amen we clear as we climbing brother
[1:46:06] Branham say the principle here is God in
[1:46:11] the people
[1:46:14] in other words the bottom line is God in
[1:46:17] the people how could God being
[1:46:20] supernatural being this man Jesus Christ
[1:46:25] you look at Jesus Christ he's talking
[1:46:27] like man
[1:46:28] he's eating like man he gets tired like
[1:46:31] man he sleep
[1:46:34] maybe he's even snoring
[1:46:40] because maybe we think God don't know
[1:46:42] maybe he's snoring they say by his story
[1:46:45] like us
[1:46:46] maybe Jesus was going one day and he hit
[1:46:49] the stone and he begin to bleed they say
[1:46:52] wait a minute God don't bleed but this
[1:46:54] one is bleeding how can this man be God
[1:46:59] size amen
[1:47:01] but he was God in human flesh
[1:47:05] he was Emmanuel in him do I left the
[1:47:09] fullness of the godhead badly Jesus was
[1:47:13] God Amen Jesus told the devil you shall
[1:47:17] not tempt who
[1:47:19] in other words Army of God you don't
[1:47:21] tempt me amen said that you went too far
[1:47:25] how can you tell me I'm the one who
[1:47:27] created you the Bible said you cannot
[1:47:30] tempt the Lord your God
[1:47:32] it is time for you to talk to the devil
[1:47:34] like that
[1:47:37] [Applause]
[1:47:41] I will check you my friend don't worry
[1:47:43] you need to test that you say listen
[1:47:45] listen stop playing I'm God that's right
[1:47:50] when God was creating I was with him
[1:47:56] you are a creature of time I am a
[1:47:59] creature of Eternity
[1:48:02] I am in the lineage of Melchizedek I
[1:48:05] don't have a beginning I don't have an
[1:48:08] end you don't accept God
[1:48:11] laughs
[1:48:12] [Applause]
[1:48:17] spoken word I don't have any children
[1:48:20] I'm gonna turn the corner you gotta turn
[1:48:22] that corner with me if you have to hold
[1:48:25] on the car like this hold on to it I'm
[1:48:27] gonna go with you
[1:48:29] when I turn the corner I'm gonna
[1:48:31] stabilize you but I won't leave you
[1:48:33] behind nobody will stay behind not even
[1:48:37] a hoof now
[1:48:40] if God put you in this church you will
[1:48:43] stay behind us
[1:48:44] [Applause]
[1:48:50] even if you stay behind I will come back
[1:48:53] and pull you back amen turn around and
[1:48:57] say let's go let's go let's go you are
[1:49:00] staying here
[1:49:02] [Applause]
[1:49:07] amen Amen
[1:49:09] brother Branham says they had never
[1:49:12] heard of that before
[1:49:15] but Jesus was doing water
[1:49:20] come up which gated to who
[1:49:29] in other words that that gate that was
[1:49:33] closed in Genesis Jesus came and said
[1:49:38] [Applause]
[1:49:45] he was opening a door to the race of
[1:49:48] Adam him being the water Son of God
[1:49:51] listen Jesus 24 34 Jesus answered is it
[1:49:55] not written in your water lord himself
[1:49:58] being the Son of God yet said I said Sid
[1:50:03] the personal pronoun in it I said yeah
[1:50:07] you yourself are God is he written in it
[1:50:12] is written is it written in your law
[1:50:14] that I said here
[1:50:16] back to water
[1:50:22] they could not water understand one time
[1:50:26] he was hooked
[1:50:29] one time he was who
[1:50:34] next time it was who Jesus speaking and
[1:50:38] he was a water
[1:50:42] so one time Abraham spoke and another
[1:50:46] time he was another Abraham that spoke
[1:50:48] that's right to know the difference
[1:50:50] watch the result amen
[1:50:55] [Applause]
[1:50:57] everybody okay everybody okay now Pastor
[1:51:01] can we have different level of faith
[1:51:04] where are you coming with this stuff
[1:51:09] [Music]
[1:51:11] where where do you get this stuff let's
[1:51:13] go to Romans 12.
[1:51:16] we're in the middle of a surgery my
[1:51:18] friend
[1:51:21] brother Robert I wish they can give me
[1:51:23] four hours to preach
[1:51:32] somebody get filled up quickly
[1:51:39] I have a quote brother Branham say when
[1:51:41] you eat it stretches your thumbs
[1:51:44] amen you there you there can we have
[1:51:48] different categories of it can we have
[1:51:51] different level of Faith Pastor where
[1:51:53] are you coming with this staff
[1:51:57] Roman chapter 12. you there amen you
[1:52:00] there amen let's go to verse three my
[1:52:02] friend for I say
[1:52:05] through the grace
[1:52:07] given to me
[1:52:10] to every man that is among you
[1:52:13] not to think of himself
[1:52:17] more highly
[1:52:19] than he ought to think
[1:52:21] Amen in other words evaluate yourself
[1:52:25] you know what you are don't fool
[1:52:28] yourself
[1:52:30] amen
[1:52:31] I'm picking I told you I'm going to pick
[1:52:33] you wherever you are if you are in
[1:52:35] kindergarten in elementary where we just
[1:52:38] gonna move together
[1:52:40] amen
[1:52:42] he says not to think of himself more
[1:52:45] highly than he ought to think but to
[1:52:48] think house
[1:52:49] comma according as God has dealt to what
[1:52:54] every man
[1:52:56] the measure of water
[1:53:02] so Every Man Has a measure amen is my
[1:53:07] Bible different than yours
[1:53:12] according to the measure of faith
[1:53:17] so faith has measured
[1:53:22] according to the way God will deal with
[1:53:24] you
[1:53:25] we clear
[1:53:27] why verse 4 for us we have many members
[1:53:32] in one body and no members have not the
[1:53:36] same water
[1:53:39] [Music]
[1:53:41] so depending on your office God knows
[1:53:44] how much to supplier
[1:53:47] but remember all of that is Faith amen
[1:53:51] [Music]
[1:53:53] all of it is faithful the measure is
[1:53:57] different but it's your faith
[1:54:02] let me go slowly because I can jump
[1:54:04] quickly up first of all so we being many
[1:54:08] our water one body in Christ and every
[1:54:13] one member of one another we clear
[1:54:16] verse 6 having then gift water differing
[1:54:21] differing according to the water Grace
[1:54:24] stop
[1:54:27] so that measure of faith is connected to
[1:54:31] Grace
[1:54:34] are we together yeah
[1:54:36] yeah according to the magic to the grace
[1:54:39] that is given to us where the water
[1:54:42] prophecy comma let us prophesy according
[1:54:47] to the water proportion of faith
[1:54:51] so faith has proportion amen
[1:54:57] faith has measure
[1:55:00] faith has proportion
[1:55:03] amen
[1:55:04] so brother Stephen you you are saying
[1:55:06] that some people have big faith and some
[1:55:09] people have little faithful slow down
[1:55:12] to begin with faith have measures
[1:55:15] faith has proportion
[1:55:19] faith has categories
[1:55:26] where did Brother Branham say this
[1:55:29] slow down I'm going by the scripture
[1:55:32] first then I'm gonna climb up through
[1:55:34] Malachi 4 because that's the perfect
[1:55:36] interpretation of the Bible today amen
[1:55:40] absolute
[1:55:41] everybody okay let's go to Matthew
[1:55:43] chapter 6. Lord help me
[1:55:48] because we spoke so much about faith
[1:55:51] we talk about your faith your Revelation
[1:55:54] your vision faith in God faith in action
[1:55:56] faith in work but somebody still may be
[1:55:59] struggling or lingering somewhere now
[1:56:01] let's pick you up
[1:56:03] amen amen
[1:56:05] amen let's go to Matthew chapter 6. if
[1:56:10] you dare you can say amen amen verse 25
[1:56:12] glory to God
[1:56:14] for I said to you take no thought
[1:56:17] for your life what you shall eat
[1:56:20] or what you shall drink not yet for your
[1:56:23] body what you shall put on
[1:56:26] is not the life more than meat and the
[1:56:29] body then remnant

[1:56:34] soul not

[1:58:09] thought in other words
[1:58:12] can add one cubic to water his statue
[1:58:17] and why take your thought for remnant
[1:58:21] consider the lilies of the field how
[1:58:23] they grow date or not they do not they
[1:58:27] neither do they spin and yet I say to
[1:58:31] you that even who
[1:58:33] in all his glory was not array like one
[1:58:37] of these
[1:58:38] wherefore if God so clothed the grass of

[1:59:08] always worry about tomorrow

[2:00:02] is characterized by worry
[2:00:04] by taking thoughts about tomorrow
[2:00:10] a doubt that don't know that God
[2:00:12] provided
[2:00:14] and that that is unconscious of the
[2:00:17] Providence of God

[2:01:42] Amen brother Brian I'm saying remember
[2:01:45] your pastor he's a man
[2:01:47] if you need the coach you ask me
[2:01:51] Matthew 8 Elizabeth verse 22 if you
[2:01:55] there you can say amen amen
[2:01:57] are you there amen
[2:01:59] Oh Glory to God Matthew 8 to verse 23
[2:02:02] the Bible says this
[2:02:05] and when he was entered into the ship
[2:02:07] his disciple followed him and behold
[2:02:10] there arose a great Tempest in the sea
[2:02:14] in so much that the ship was covered
[2:02:17] with the wave but he was how
[2:02:21] and his disciple came to him
[2:02:24] and they woke him up saying Lord
[2:02:27] save us we do water
[2:02:31] can I read the Bible verse 26 and he
[2:02:36] said to them why are you how therefore
[2:02:39] are you of water and neither faith is a
[2:02:43] faith that is fearful amen foreign
[2:02:52] in other words the faith of Jesus and
[2:02:54] the faith was different
[2:03:00] are we together faith in categories he
[2:03:03] said what money of man is this
[2:03:07] that even the water
[2:03:10] and the water the water obey him so
[2:03:13] there is a faith that you can stop to
[2:03:16] cease
[2:03:17] there is a faith that you can speak to
[2:03:19] Nature that's right
[2:03:23] [Music]
[2:03:26] the Sea and the wind there is a faith
[2:03:30] that can affect nature
[2:03:32] amen
[2:03:34] it can affect the element of this Earth
[2:03:39] in other words even if a storm is rising
[2:03:42] up
[2:03:43] [Music]
[2:03:45] you can speak to the song
[2:03:48] you can say you storm go back over there
[2:03:51] and you son you need to shine for three
[2:03:54] days
[2:03:55] [Music]
[2:03:58] I hope you reading the message
[2:04:01] and I hope you know what I'm talking
[2:04:03] about because somebody spoke to the wind
[2:04:06] in this time if you don't know his name
[2:04:09] is William Marion Branham
[2:04:11] [Applause]
[2:04:12] and the wind obey him and the wind went
[2:04:16] back and sat quiet
[2:04:18] [Applause]
[2:04:24] lead the faith
[2:04:27] amen let's go to Matthew 14.
[2:04:32] father help me
[2:04:35] you dare you can say Amen faith in
[2:04:38] categories
[2:04:40] if I don't finish it my brother you call
[2:04:42] this faith in categories then the next
[2:04:44] time we say faith in the level so we
[2:04:46] keep it balanced
[2:04:48] or in type maybe we can give it like
[2:04:51] this Matthew 14 let's go to verse 25. if
[2:04:55] you're there you can say amen amen we
[2:04:57] there
[2:04:58] we there amen and in the Fourth Watch of
[2:05:02] the night Jesus went to them I'm still
[2:05:05] in Matthew I have not changed to look so
[2:05:07] you can see the sequence
[2:05:11] Jesus went to them doing water walking
[2:05:14] on the
[2:05:16] hmm
[2:05:18] come on Amen
[2:05:20] everybody okay Jesus faithful
[2:05:25] is like a 96.
[2:05:29] come on brother amen slow down
[2:05:33] amen
[2:05:34] She's Every surface as normal
[2:05:39] if a ant come here he will enter to
[2:05:42] church just like you but when the earth
[2:05:44] hit this wall
[2:05:46] the aunt doesn't sit like a wall you
[2:05:49] will see the Earth entering and going
[2:05:51] this way
[2:05:52] that's right
[2:05:53] and when the earth hit the ceiling you
[2:05:56] won't see him falling he will be on the
[2:05:58] ceiling keep moving like this
[2:06:05] everybody okay because his perception is
[2:06:08] different from you and that perception
[2:06:11] give him the law against gravity
[2:06:17] [Applause]
[2:06:24] the vision of in it give him power over
[2:06:28] gravity
[2:06:29] [Applause]
[2:06:34] you said the Earth doesn't have weight
[2:06:36] even the Geico does it
[2:06:42] everybody good so when Jesus is walking
[2:06:46] Jesus can be coming and you see him
[2:06:49] going to the Sea and he goes like this
[2:06:52] and then he entered the sea somebody say
[2:06:54] well you're going to the Sea Jesus said
[2:06:56] what they see
[2:06:59] before you know it Jesus is walking on
[2:07:02] the water
[2:07:06] so Jesus had a certain level of faith
[2:07:09] that can even walk on water
[2:07:16] hahaha
[2:07:18] walk on what the H2O my friend
[2:07:21] amen what faith is that what kind of man
[2:07:24] is this one
[2:07:27] a man that can speak to the Sea a man
[2:07:30] that can speak to the to the wind a man
[2:07:33] that can even walk in the water and yet
[2:07:35] he was opening the gate for the rest of
[2:07:38] Adam
[2:07:39] [Music]
[2:07:42] he was bringing us back where we are
[2:07:45] supposed to be
[2:07:46] I am
[2:07:48] I know if I get where I'm getting it
[2:07:51] will challenge a lot of folks
[2:07:54] I know
[2:07:55] everybody okay everybody okay so when he
[2:07:59] begin to walk what happened
[2:08:03] please follow me carefully I'm gonna
[2:08:06] pick you up wherever you are
[2:08:08] if you're in kindergarten we're picking
[2:08:10] you up
[2:08:11] okay because your faith might be in
[2:08:13] kindergarten
[2:08:14] but it's still Faith but I'm gonna show
[2:08:17] you what do you do with a kindergarten
[2:08:19] faith
[2:08:20] amen
[2:08:22] amen
[2:08:24] let's go we are there and then verse 26
[2:08:27] and when the disciples saw him walking
[2:08:29] on the sea they were trouble saying it
[2:08:32] is water spirit you see
[2:08:35] we watch Harry Potter too much
[2:08:38] we got Halloween Halloween store
[2:08:40] everywhere so anything Supernatural is
[2:08:44] spooky
[2:08:45] [Music]
[2:08:48] when they give a testimony oh brother we
[2:08:50] better have the doctor stuff
[2:08:52] we don't believe too much
[2:08:55] but if you say no they give me
[2:08:57] medication and they work okay that
[2:08:58] medication is powerful I remember my
[2:09:01] grandma took a citromason and he works
[2:09:03] very well
[2:09:05] [Applause]
[2:09:10] you need to be careful
[2:09:14] I am a supernatural being that's right
[2:09:19] I'm just discovering what the Earth
[2:09:22] feels like
[2:09:24] [Music]
[2:09:26] [Laughter]
[2:09:26] [Applause]
[2:09:29] amen amen they say it is a spirit and
[2:09:33] they cry out for what fear
[2:09:36] we clear we clear
[2:09:39] we clear
[2:09:41] but immediately Jesus spoke to them and
[2:09:44] say what they
[2:09:46] it is
[2:09:50] and pay the answer to him and say Lord
[2:09:54] if it be you do water
[2:09:56] beat me to come where unto thee on the
[2:10:00] water
[2:10:04] we okay
[2:10:05] which Faith did this be they use to get
[2:10:10] on water
[2:10:11] let's go slowly amen beat me to come on
[2:10:14] the water and he said what
[2:10:17] account
[2:10:19] amen come on Peter sacrificed you tell
[2:10:22] me to come on the water too Jesus said
[2:10:25] oh somebody has uh audacity come
[2:10:30] he didn't give him no inspection
[2:10:33] because no one else spoke
[2:10:35] only Peter
[2:10:39] we okay are we okay and then when Peter
[2:10:43] he said come and when Peter was come
[2:10:46] down out of the ship he did what walked
[2:10:49] on the water so Jesus is not the only
[2:10:52] one that walk on water that's right
[2:10:56] because Jesus was virgin born but Peter
[2:11:00] was not virgin born so a man that is
[2:11:03] born out of a man and a woman can also
[2:11:06] walk on water
[2:11:07] thank God for people like Peter amen
[2:11:14] I can move on Unfaithful and give us a
[2:11:18] grant that we can claim amen
[2:11:21] amen and then he says and then he walk
[2:11:25] on the water to go to Jesus
[2:11:28] but when he saw the water when
[2:11:32] boisterous the wind posturates he was
[2:11:34] power
[2:11:36] and begin to do water he cried saying
[2:11:40] water lord save me and immediately Jesus
[2:11:43] stretched forth his hand and caught him
[2:11:46] and say to him owe you water a little
[2:11:50] faith wherefore did you utter now so a
[2:11:53] little faith can also walk on the water
[2:11:57] amen
[2:12:05] cannot stop here so you can chew this at
[2:12:08] home and we can come back later
[2:12:11] huh
[2:12:14] when when they say spoke when they say
[2:12:17] walk on water you thought he was a big
[2:12:19] fish now Jesus is saying Peter has a lot
[2:12:24] of faithful because he felt he was
[2:12:26] doubting Jesus never doubt
[2:12:29] that's right the faith of Jesus never
[2:12:31] doubt
[2:12:33] the faith of Jesus was not faithful and
[2:12:36] Jesus walked in the water the faithful
[2:12:38] Peter even though he was small but he
[2:12:41] can get the result
[2:12:44] amazing
[2:12:47] because when they say lead the faith
[2:12:50] worrying with the people before you know
[2:12:52] it you begin to to despise the Lord of
[2:12:55] faithful Lord of faith can walk on the
[2:12:58] water
[2:12:58] that's right
[2:13:00] [Music]
[2:13:02] I'm gonna pick you up where you are my
[2:13:04] friend
[2:13:05] amen because it is still faithful that's
[2:13:09] right
[2:13:11] Jesus Christ
[2:13:13] amen amen amen amen
[2:13:17] glory to God let's go to Matthew 16.
[2:13:22] father help me
[2:13:27] Jesus Christ
[2:13:32] you see all of this we just moved from
[2:13:34] here to here
[2:13:37] so for me to get here I don't know
[2:13:41] everybody okay Matthew 16 if you dare
[2:13:45] you can say amen amen let's go to verse
[2:13:47] 5 my friend he says and when this
[2:13:51] disciple will come to the other side
[2:13:53] they have forgotten to do water break
[2:13:55] bread to take bread and then and no then
[2:13:59] Jesus there is no end I don't want to
[2:14:01] add anything
[2:14:03] then Jesus said to them take it and be
[2:14:06] aware of the leaven of the Pharisee and
[2:14:09] of the sad you see and the reason among
[2:14:12] themselves corner
[2:14:14] saying it is because we have taken water
[2:14:17] no bread
[2:14:19] which when Jesus perceived he says to
[2:14:23] them oh
[2:14:24] year of water
[2:14:26] why reason you among yourself
[2:14:30] it is a faith that have a lot of
[2:14:33] reasoning
[2:14:43] why reason ye among yourself because you
[2:14:47] have brought water a worry of the bread
[2:14:51] Jesus said do you not yet understand
[2:14:55] neither remember the Five Loaves of five
[2:14:58] thousand and how many baskets you took
[2:15:01] up needed the seven loaves of the four
[2:15:03] thousand and how many uh baskets you
[2:15:06] have took up in other words Jesus did
[2:15:09] this miracle twice
[2:15:13] two times my friend and then on the
[2:15:16] third time they begin to question again
[2:15:21] in other words you are sick God rescue
[2:15:24] you
[2:15:25] you were sick God rescue you now you get
[2:15:28] sick again and you begin to worry and
[2:15:30] God say you don't understand do you
[2:15:33] remember you were in the hospital I hit
[2:15:35] you don't you remember the second time I
[2:15:38] did that why you don't understand
[2:15:41] [Applause]
[2:15:48] it is a baby face
[2:15:51] a faith that one to be part of the time
[2:15:54] Jesus look he said you don't know in
[2:15:56] other words when I'm doing miracle on
[2:15:58] your life don't you know that I'm giving
[2:16:00] you a lesson
[2:16:03] amen so that next time when something
[2:16:06] happened you ought to remember
[2:16:10] because remember last Sunday when an
[2:16:13] experience come in your life it's also
[2:16:15] seed for the future that's right that's
[2:16:18] right
[2:16:18] [Applause]
[2:16:20] you're gonna enjoy the present time but
[2:16:23] keep it as a bullet for the future
[2:16:25] that's why David said the god that
[2:16:27] deliver me from the lion from The Bear
[2:16:30] now he can do it for this and
[2:16:31] circumcised your lion could be
[2:16:34] coronavirus your bear could be pneumonia
[2:16:37] but if today something else rise up
[2:16:40] remind that devil
[2:16:42] just like your brother coronavirish and
[2:16:46] your brother pneumonia and your brother
[2:16:48] kisses just as I destroyed them I'm
[2:16:52] gonna cut off your head
[2:16:53] [Applause]
[2:16:54] [Music]
[2:16:55] [Applause]
[2:16:55] [Music]
[2:16:58] because you are of the same lineage and

[2:26:25] bring something closer to him
[2:26:30] are we together
[2:26:32] this faith can bring something far away
[2:26:35] from you

[2:27:18] like this amen by your faith
[2:27:22] [Music]
[2:27:28] amen amen Jesus
[2:27:31] and say to them that water in other
[2:27:35] words he stopped he said hey
[2:27:38] he even left the one he turned to the
[2:27:41] disciple
[2:27:42] he said this is what I was trying to
[2:27:43] teach you boy
[2:27:46] all of you wake up
[2:27:49] who's there are you there tell the other
[2:27:51] one who's looking at the restaurant over

[2:28:01] you trying to tell them Jesus say verily
[2:28:05] I say unto you
[2:28:07] I have not found
[2:28:10] saltwater
[2:28:14] we're not in leadership now now we are
[2:28:17] in water great thing
[2:28:22] so there is a little faith
[2:28:24] and there is also a water great thing
[2:28:26] and great faith only Targets this
[2:28:30] way that's right
[2:28:35] it's a faith that can bring something
[2:28:37] closer I'll put something away
[2:28:43] it's a faith that doesn't care about the
[2:28:46] distance
[2:28:47] it's a fifth to understand its own
[2:28:50] authority
[2:28:54] amen
[2:28:56] verily I have not found no faith not in
[2:29:00] water Israel
[2:29:01] this Faith Jesus didn't find it in
[2:29:04] Israel
[2:29:09] Jesus Christ he had the word it's a
[2:29:12] specie of faith
[2:29:19] that lives on the Jetta
[2:29:22] [Applause]
[2:29:24] [Music]
[2:29:26] [Applause]
[2:29:28] because brother Branham says
[2:29:32] brother Branham says that we have seven
[2:29:36] churches
[2:29:37] you okay wait for me
[2:29:39] we have Ephesus
[2:29:42] we have Smyrna
[2:29:44] we have pergaments we have tatarian we
[2:29:48] have Sardis
[2:29:49] we have Philadelphia and we have
[2:29:51] laodicea
[2:29:53] amen brother brought them safe from here
[2:29:57] to here the majority of the people were
[2:30:00] Jews
[2:30:04] because Jesus told them go into all the
[2:30:07] word preach beginning at Jerusalem all
[2:30:11] the church started with the apostle and
[2:30:14] he was moving on brother but I'm saying
[2:30:16] when he reached that Italian age amen
[2:30:19] this is when the church flipped
[2:30:21] completely
[2:30:22] from a Jews amen into the Gentile
[2:30:28] everybody okay
[2:30:29] everybody okay and it looked like at the
[2:30:33] very end when because right here you
[2:30:36] might maybe have leftover
[2:30:38] of juice
[2:30:40] right here you might have maybe a little
[2:30:42] little bit so at the very end when there
[2:30:46] is purely Jetta
[2:30:49] that's when God sent the spoken word
[2:30:52] amen
[2:31:00] and Jesus said this faithful I have not
[2:31:03] funded nowhere in nature in other words
[2:31:05] every time I deal with the Jews they
[2:31:07] come up with something else
[2:31:09] but this boy
[2:31:13] where did you get this stuff
[2:31:17] and Jesus called that the water great
[2:31:20] thing all this terminology are coming
[2:31:22] from the mouth of Jesus I'm not the one
[2:31:24] producing it
[2:31:27] fifth in categories amen
[2:31:30] Jesus said on 11 and I say unto you that
[2:31:34] many shall come from water
[2:31:37] and shall sit down with who
[2:31:43] with Abraham and water
[2:31:46] and who in the Kingdom of water but the
[2:31:50] children of the Kingdom the Jews shall
[2:31:52] be how cast out into outer Darkness
[2:31:55] there shall be water
[2:31:57] in other words the Jews will be in the
[2:32:01] tribulation period under the Sixth Seal
[2:32:04] with Moses and Elijah but we will find a
[2:32:08] generation
[2:32:10] that will sit with Abraham
[2:32:12] [Music]
[2:32:14] with Isaac and Jacob
[2:32:16] Abraham the father of our favor and the
[2:32:19] father of our faith when he's in
[2:32:21] difficulty he said things and he creates
[2:32:24] something
