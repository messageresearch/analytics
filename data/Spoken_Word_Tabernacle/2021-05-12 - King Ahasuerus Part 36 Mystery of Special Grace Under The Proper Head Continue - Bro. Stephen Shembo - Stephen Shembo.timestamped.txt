[13:54] the god jesus christ's name we pray amen
[13:59] you know may be seated
[14:02] i was just thinking on the way to church
[14:04] this evening
[14:05] the craziness with the the gas shortage
[14:08] because of
[14:09] a virus i don't know how many of you are
[14:12] aware of exactly what happened but
[14:14] someone had a virus somewhere that they
[14:16] led into the network
[14:18] of the of the company and that virus
[14:20] spread throughout their entire network
[14:23] and and brought the network down and
[14:26] caused you know the flow of gas and and
[14:29] everything we're dealing with but i was
[14:30] thinking about it on the way to church
[14:31] and
[14:32] brother braham talked about a virus a
[14:34] root of bitterness being like a virus
[14:36] in the body of believers and i thought
[14:38] about how a root of bitterness will get
[14:39] into one person
[14:41] and if you don't recognize that virus
[14:43] that virus can spread and it can spread
[14:45] throughout the whole body of believers
[14:47] and then you know all it takes is
[14:49] activating that virus and it could it
[14:50] could shut everything down
[14:52] so i was just thinking that i'm like let
[14:54] no root of bitterness be in the church
[14:56] rather replace it with the holy spirit
[14:58] let that holy spirit come in as a virus
[15:00] spread throughout the body of believers
[15:02] and that we can just
[15:04] you know be all in unity and love one
[15:07] another
[15:07] but i was just thinking that it's just
[15:09] something small and if satan can slip it
[15:11] in
[15:12] then it'll cause it'll cause a pandemic
[15:15] so we just want to be sure that we we
[15:18] love one another and that that holy
[15:19] ghost is
[15:20] is here and flowing and i believe it is
[15:22] i believe it is so we're thankful for
[15:24] that this evening
[15:25] does anyone have a special on their
[15:26] heart this evening brother robert
[15:30] and sister shannon
[15:42] amen god bless you all i've had this
[15:46] special in my heart for about two weeks
[15:48] and
[15:48] i keep putting it off and someday i had
[15:52] to repent said lord i should not be
[15:55] putting it off i just want to
[15:57] sing it for his glory
[16:00] something was preached two weeks ago and
[16:03] it reminded me of
[16:05] our position as kings and priests
[16:08] in this end time and how we have to
[16:11] intercede for our loved ones
[16:15] [Music]
[16:17] i also want to do mine please i just
[16:20] want to give the lord a
[16:23] lot of praise today i was feeling really
[16:25] um

[16:29] heaviness i'm trying to get some work
[16:31] done

[16:33] just so heavy to start
[16:35] but i got going and uh my mind went back

[16:40] service and um as i began to think about
[16:43] that i
[16:44] really felt a strong presence coming to
[16:46] the building and
[16:48] it was the presence of the lord and was
[16:50] he just i just began to weep and worship
[16:53] him and

[16:57] such an experience just thank god for
[16:58] encouraging
[17:00] couraging us that way praise god
[17:05] the cry went out and the destroyers
[17:10] gathered in
[17:14] each one with his weapon
[17:18] in his hand
[17:21] [Music]
[17:23] to slay both young and old
[17:30] destroyers
[17:32] the command had come for

[40:30] proper head
[40:32] because there is a grace there is an
[40:34] equipment that is loaded there
[40:36] amen and that equipment is handy
[40:40] you need it when in extreme situation
[40:44] if not we can make it amen
[40:49] but thank god for predestination
[40:53] i have to bring this example one by one
[40:55] so you
[40:56] anchored ready
[41:00] you remember jesus gave a test a parable
[41:03] in the scripture he says there's there
[41:05] were two men that were building houses
[41:08] but one of them had to dig until he
[41:11] reached the rock
[41:13] he have to dig so sometimes we gotta dig
[41:16] into the world
[41:19] the message has been digged from the
[41:21] bible
[41:23] it was hidden esther chapter eight you
[41:26] already know this
[41:29] but i want to make a point there so we
[41:31] move on
[41:32] if you're there you can say amen esther
[41:35] chapter eight verse one
[41:37] on that day did king a hazardous
[41:41] give the house of heaven the jew's enemy
[41:45] to esther we already explained you this
[41:47] the house of amen
[41:49] that power that was coming everything
[41:52] was under the jurisdiction of esther
[41:55] which is the top of the brother
[41:57] we already demonstrated to you esther is
[41:59] the bride and mordecai
[42:01] is brother brother the seven ninja who's
[42:03] working with the bride
[42:04] and bringing the bride all the way to
[42:06] the presence of the king amen
[42:08] he said the house of the jew of heaven
[42:11] the jews enemy to esther the queen
[42:14] and mordecai came before the king
[42:18] for esther had told what he was to her
[42:22] and the king took off his ring
[42:26] remember that ring was the one heyman
[42:29] wrote
[42:31] and hold the letter and seal it
[42:34] and once that ring goes there it is
[42:37] irrevocable
[42:39] amen but let's see to whom god is gonna
[42:43] our
[42:44] king a hazaris or god he's gonna give
[42:46] darien
[42:47] and the king took off his ring the wing
[42:50] of the king
[42:51] which he had taken from heaven
[42:54] temporarily
[42:56] and gave it to esther
[43:01] why he didn't give it to esther
[43:04] the power of the headship
[43:08] the power of the headship that ring
[43:12] is given to modica you remember zorobel
[43:16] he's a signet amen that ring is given to
[43:21] the
[43:21] messenger he's the one that have the
[43:23] ring
[43:24] if he says something the king
[43:27] automatically
[43:28] will have to approve because the
[43:30] approval the seal of the king is with
[43:32] him
[43:33] if he writes something he put a seal
[43:36] it's going to pass
[43:38] but it's given to the head because
[43:40] remember mordecai was the legal
[43:43] guardian to forfest esther didn't have
[43:46] his father
[43:47] mother they all died so she was under
[43:49] the jurisdiction
[43:50] of monica amen so our old natural family
[43:55] that we were born under we are now
[43:58] reborn
[43:59] by the bread into the blood by the son
[44:02] of god
[44:03] who free us from our old nature now are
[44:06] being born
[44:07] you wonder the jurisdiction of malachi
[44:10] 4.
[44:14] amen and there is a grace that goes
[44:17] under malachi 4.
[44:19] you got to stay under the amen
[44:23] let's go to verse uh
[44:27] let's go to verse seven
[44:30] then king then the king a hazaris said
[44:34] to esther after she pleaded the queen
[44:36] and tomorrow they caught the jews behold
[44:39] i have given esther the house of heaven
[44:42] and him they have hanged upon the carlos
[44:47] because he laid his hand upon the jews
[44:50] we know what the jews are
[44:51] in the new testament they are the
[44:53] children of god paul explained to us
[44:55] who a true jew is verse 8
[44:58] write you also for the jews
[45:01] as he likes you in other words
[45:05] as he wishes you whatever you wanted
[45:09] you write it amen
[45:13] in the in the king's name
[45:16] you see where the power comes from under
[45:19] the headship of the king and the
[45:21] headship of monika
[45:23] now monica can say something in the
[45:26] king's
[45:26] name with the signal and it will be
[45:30] approved
[45:31] and seal it with the king's ring
[45:35] for the writing which is written
[45:38] in the king's name and sealed
[45:42] with the king's ring may no man do water
[45:46] so once they seal it it is completed
[45:50] amen verse 9 then
[45:54] were the king's crab called at that time
[45:57] in the third month you might be seated
[45:59] that is the month
[46:00] seven and the three
[46:04] and twentieth day thereof it was written
[46:07] according to all
[46:09] that esther commanded
[46:12] who's writing makes sense
[46:16] to all that mordechai commanded to the
[46:19] jews
[46:20] and to the lieutenants and the deputies
[46:24] and the rulers of the provinces which
[46:26] are from
[46:27] india to ethiopia a hundred and twenty
[46:30] and seven provinces
[46:32] to every province according to the
[46:34] riding thereof
[46:35] and to every people after the water
[46:38] that's why they have to translate the
[46:40] message
[46:42] in many languages so he can be carried
[46:46] away
[46:47] amen every language and to the jews
[46:51] according to the writing
[46:53] according to the water language the seal
[46:56] was given to mordecai because he's the
[46:59] head
[47:00] and that still have a power in a
[47:03] difficult situation like the one a man
[47:06] already got permission to destroy the
[47:08] jews they had the right to reverse that
[47:10] situation
[47:12] if you stay under the proper headship
[47:16] amen let's go to matthew chapter 10.
[47:20] the headship the hair of a woman what a
[47:23] mystery
[47:27] what a mystery no one the brother
[47:29] brother i'm saying go home
[47:30] and study amen
[47:35] if somebody's really really
[47:38] catch it it seems like we are preaching
[47:42] marriage and divorce
[47:43] have you caught that have you got it
[47:47] since we started our headship go take
[47:50] the tape of marriage and divorce and put
[47:51] it and go back to 33 34 35
[47:55] it's like we're preaching marriage and
[47:56] divorce
[48:00] matthew chapter 10 verse 5. if you're
[48:02] there you can say amen
[48:04] these 12 jesus sent forth
[48:08] and commanded them saying god not
[48:11] into the way of water number one
[48:14] the gentile
[48:18] gentile one gentile
[48:23] amen kama and
[48:26] into any city of the samaritan
[48:30] enter you not number two the samaritan
[48:35] how many time have you heard brother
[48:38] brown i'm telling you
[48:39] jew gentile samaritan jew gentiles
[48:42] and he never gave you a scripture
[48:46] you thought he was lying
[48:50] amen enter you not verse six
[48:53] but go rather to the lordship of the
[48:56] house of water
[48:58] your coat is ready
[49:02] next time somebody say where is that in
[49:03] the scripture you know where it is
[49:05] the gentile the samaritan and the jew
[49:08] three classes brother branham keep
[49:11] repeating them
[49:12] it is in the scripture the message is
[49:14] perfectly in line
[49:16] with the scripture amen but the key here
[49:21] is jesus told the disciple don't go here
[49:26] anybody here do not go there
[49:30] ever here the only door that is open
[49:33] right now
[49:34] is the door of the jew
[49:38] it is that safe the lord let's go to
[49:41] chapter 15.
[49:45] that says the lord in other words if a
[49:48] gentile want to come in do they have an
[49:50] acceptance
[49:52] if a samaritan want to come in do they
[49:54] have an access
[49:56] let's see what proper headship does
[50:01] amen you will really appreciate the
[50:04] message
[50:04] if it was not for this message we will
[50:07] be cornered
[50:08] in denomination and doomed to the
[50:11] slaughter
[50:13] 15 verse 21 if you dare you can say amen
[50:18] then jesus went from there and departed
[50:21] into the coast of water and water
[50:24] are those israelites okay
[50:28] it's not empty territory for israel and
[50:31] behold
[50:32] a woman of canaan came out of the same
[50:37] coast and cry
[50:39] to him saying have mercy on me
[50:42] o lord you son of water
[50:45] why did he do why did she call son of
[50:48] david because the door
[50:50] that was opened was water israel
[50:53] son of david so she's using the jewish
[50:56] law
[50:59] okay she didn't know
[51:04] you must show your id amen
[51:09] and cried to him saying have mercy on me
[51:12] o lord
[51:13] you son of david my daughter
[51:16] is grievously fixed with the devil
[51:19] but he answered her not
[51:24] why that woman was a sorrow phoenician
[51:28] anybody clear the door is not open to
[51:31] the gentile
[51:33] lock the woman could turn around and say
[51:37] you know what there's no need for me to
[51:39] do anything let me go ahead
[51:40] amen but he answered her not a word
[51:44] and his disciple came and besought him
[51:47] saying
[51:48] send her away for she cries after so
[51:51] somebody was persistent
[51:53] even though the door is closed to the
[51:56] gentile
[51:57] still that person is persistent because
[52:00] they
[52:00] understood the head amen
[52:04] but he answer and say i am not sent
[52:09] back to the lordship of the house of
[52:12] water
[52:13] in other words the only available door
[52:16] right now
[52:17] is only the jewish door so there is
[52:19] nothing i can do for this woman
[52:22] because she's not a jew
[52:28] amen i'm just reading a scripture
[52:31] verse 25 then can she and do water
[52:35] and worship him saying water was that
[52:38] the time of the gentile yet
[52:40] [Music]
[52:42] but that woman pushed that door out like
[52:45] abraham
[52:47] and say lord remember lot the first time
[52:51] say my lord and he got in trouble
[52:55] by the second time when lord said lord
[52:58] then an anointing drop
[53:00] amen when she said she worshiped and
[53:02] said my
[53:03] lord then even though it's not the time
[53:12] there is a power and appropriation
[53:15] then comes here and worship him saying
[53:18] lord
[53:19] help me oh so this
[53:22] is working so now because he worshipped
[53:25] jesus jesus is going to tell her
[53:27] now i understand sweetheart come on now
[53:29] and tell me what is going on
[53:31] let's see what's happening amen
[53:34] but he answer and say it is not
[53:37] meat it's not fitting
[53:40] to take the children bread the children
[53:43] were
[53:43] israel and to cast it to her
[53:48] in other words you were dug i cannot
[53:51] take again what belonged to the children
[53:54] and give it to you i already told you
[53:56] that this
[53:57] door is only to the jewish people
[54:05] amen even if the message
[54:09] call you a buzzard because of the life
[54:12] you are living
[54:13] don't go out stay with the message
[54:18] even if the message rebuke you stand
[54:22] with the message
[54:26] this is a proof to show who is
[54:28] predestinated
[54:30] if you back off you were not meant for
[54:32] it
[54:33] [Applause]
[54:35] brother branham is hard on the system
[54:37] right one of his wire hard on the sister
[54:39] sister stand with the message as
[54:42] hard as it seems to be stand with the
[54:45] message
[54:46] [Applause]
[54:50] hallelujah and she said truth
[54:54] in other words what you say is right
[54:57] truth lord
[54:58] yet the dogs who gave her the resolution
[55:03] who told her that yet the dogs
[55:07] eat of the crumbs which fall
[55:10] from their master's table
[55:14] what an aspiration in other words your
[55:18] door
[55:18] is closed but remember there is a grace
[55:22] that usually owes out
[55:24] underneath the table i am not looking
[55:27] for the door
[55:28] i can get that small club of grace
[55:31] that's all i need to make it to my
[55:34] destination
[55:35] hallelujah hallelujah all i need is
[55:39] a crumb of grace just tell the crimes
[55:43] just a little dropping the priest on
[55:46] brother kelly
[55:47] just that last job that's all i need
[55:51] to take me to heaven hallelujah
[55:55] oh truth lord yet dogs eat of the crumbs
[55:59] which fall from their master's table
[56:02] then jesus
[56:03] answered and said to her oh woman
[56:08] great is your water what faith
[56:11] open a gentile door before the time your
[56:16] faith be it to you even as you water
[56:21] in other words whatever you wanted
[56:26] whatever that woman had in her mind
[56:30] no matter the difficulty no matter the
[56:33] situation
[56:34] no matter how big the issue is
[56:38] whatever was inserted that grace was
[56:41] sufficient
[56:42] to grant her request amen
[56:46] and her daughter was made all from that
[56:49] very
[56:50] hour everybody clear so far let's go to
[56:53] luke chapter 7 then we pray
[56:55] blessed be the name of the lord
[56:58] understanding proper headsheet that had
[57:02] sheep might be tough
[57:03] sometime but you stay with it
[57:06] because grace will always come there
[57:09] remember on sunday
[57:10] that's why david said let me fall in the
[57:13] hand of god
[57:15] if he want to slay me let me fall in his
[57:17] hand then his mercy
[57:19] something will come out there and rescue
[57:21] me from his hand
[57:23] amen and matter of fact if you're in the
[57:25] hand of god nobody can pluck you out
[57:29] you see david you see david
[57:32] in other words put me there and i'm
[57:34] gonna see who's gonna pluck me out of
[57:36] there
[57:39] luke chapter 7 verse 1.
[57:42] you there you can say amen now when he
[57:45] had
[57:46] ended all his saying in the audience of
[57:49] the people
[57:50] he entered into capernaum and a certain
[57:54] centurion
[57:55] servant who was dear to him was sick
[57:59] and ready to die and when he heard
[58:02] faith of jesus he sent to him the elders
[58:07] of the jew remember the door was the
[58:10] door to him
[58:12] so this one understands a little bit he
[58:14] said hey let me get the jews
[58:16] and bring my request to the jew and let
[58:19] the jew goes and the jew can enter
[58:21] and they can bring on my request because
[58:23] the door is the door to the jew
[58:27] amen he sent him the elders of the jew
[58:31] beseeching in other words begging him
[58:33] that he would come
[58:35] and heal his servant and when they came
[58:38] to
[58:38] jesus they besought him instantly they
[58:41] are pleading
[58:43] saying that he was worthy for whom
[58:46] he should do this in other words this
[58:48] person is worthy
[58:52] hallelujah for he loves our
[58:55] nation like ruth
[58:58] remember your people will be my people
[59:00] remember
[59:01] rahab i want to go with you i don't want
[59:03] to die here
[59:04] he loves our nation and he has built
[59:08] us a welcome he even built a church
[59:12] he's not just like any other gentile
[59:15] that is up there
[59:16] that is still worshiping adult this one
[59:19] is a proselyte to the god of israel
[59:22] he is part of our commonwealth amen
[59:26] then jesus went with them if you notice
[59:30] jesus never refused
[59:32] because they used the jew to insert
[59:36] the petition
[59:39] amen then jesus went with them
[59:43] and when he was now not far from the
[59:46] house the house of who
[59:49] of the centurion a house of a gentile
[59:53] he's bringing the jews but going to the
[59:56] gentile
[59:56] but the gentiles have a lock
[1:00:01] amen the centurion said who now
[1:00:07] friends we don't know who they are to
[1:00:10] him
[1:00:11] saying to him lord
[1:00:15] not son of david lord
[1:00:19] trouble not yourself
[1:00:22] for i am not what the jews said he was
[1:00:26] worthy
[1:00:27] but when he's approaching he said i am
[1:00:30] not worthy
[1:00:32] hallelujah i am not worthy that you
[1:00:35] should enter
[1:00:36] under my water i am a gentile
[1:00:40] the gentle door is closed you only came
[1:00:43] for the lordship of the house of israel
[1:00:46] i am not worthy for you to enter here
[1:00:49] i don't want to deviate to your program
[1:00:51] but i'm looking for something
[1:00:55] amen wherefore neither thought i
[1:00:58] myself worthy to do what
[1:01:01] are not even worthy to come to you our
[1:01:05] door is closed
[1:01:07] amen to come to you but
[1:01:11] say in a word and my servant shall be
[1:01:14] healed
[1:01:15] for i also am a man
[1:01:18] set under water i understand
[1:01:22] headship
[1:01:23] [Applause]
[1:01:26] [Music]
[1:01:29] in the scripture i understand
[1:01:32] hardship i understand authority
[1:01:37] and because i understand authority
[1:01:40] i understand what is going on amen
[1:01:44] for i am a man set under
[1:01:48] authority having under me water
[1:01:52] soldiers and i say to one go and he goes
[1:01:56] and to another calm and he comes and to
[1:01:59] my servant do this
[1:02:01] and he does this when jesus
[1:02:04] heard these things amen
[1:02:07] he marvel at him and turn
[1:02:10] him about and say to the people that
[1:02:13] follow water
[1:02:15] i say unto you i have not found so
[1:02:19] great faith no not in water
[1:02:23] was it the time of the gentile he can
[1:02:27] pull the door open
[1:02:29] amen and they that were sent
[1:02:32] returning to the house found the servant
[1:02:36] hole
[1:02:36] that had been watered when every hope
[1:02:40] seems to be
[1:02:40] closed if you understand proper headship
[1:02:45] a door of mercy a door of grace can be
[1:02:48] opened
[1:02:49] just to rescue the predestination let's
[1:02:52] pray heavenly father
[1:02:55] lord we thank you again for your grace
[1:02:57] your love your mercy father
[1:02:59] and for everything you have been doing
[1:03:01] for us

[1:03:48] your children

[1:03:58] strengthen our body lord father
[1:04:00] enlighten our faith more and more
[1:04:02] into the depths of christ as we humbly
[1:04:05] ask it
[1:04:06] in the name of jesus christ amen
[1:04:09] god bless you you've already been seated
[1:04:12] we're going to continue where we left
[1:04:14] off
[1:04:14] on sunday we're on part 36.
[1:04:17] everybody clear so far we established by
[1:04:21] the
[1:04:22] understanding of the hair of a woman
[1:04:25] the headship we found that the headship
[1:04:28] of the entire bride
[1:04:30] the the headship of everything was
[1:04:33] crushed
[1:04:34] which is the chief shepherd or the chief
[1:04:36] pastor
[1:04:37] then for every age according to the
[1:04:39] gentile dispensation
[1:04:41] there is seven columns upon which the
[1:04:44] wisdom of god set
[1:04:45] and a column remember and a column
[1:04:48] represented a man which shows the
[1:04:50] seventh
[1:04:51] messenger through every seven church
[1:04:53] ages and they have the door
[1:04:55] to the entrance into the blood and those
[1:04:58] seven messengers brother branham said
[1:05:00] that every messenger was a pastor to his
[1:05:03] church that was the head
[1:05:05] of the church ages amen then after the
[1:05:08] messenger
[1:05:09] come the local pastor which should be
[1:05:12] under the messenger of his age
[1:05:15] then under that local pastor who is
[1:05:17] following the messenger
[1:05:19] who is following christ should be the
[1:05:22] husband
[1:05:22] and the father or the legal guardian
[1:05:25] amen
[1:05:26] and we found out that with the headship
[1:05:29] goes
[1:05:29] a special grace that we demonstrated on
[1:05:32] sunday
[1:05:33] in the life of abraham lincoln when that
[1:05:35] boy was
[1:05:36] declared guilty but a pardon could be
[1:05:39] issued regardless of the decision of the
[1:05:42] court
[1:05:43] the boy rejected and he was fired and
[1:05:46] killed
[1:05:46] and the supreme court said pardon is a
[1:05:50] pardon
[1:05:50] only when it's received as a pardon amen
[1:05:53] but to receive as a pardon you must
[1:05:55] recognize
[1:05:56] and understand the proper head shift
[1:05:59] there is a special grace
[1:06:01] and that special grace bring a special
[1:06:04] bring
[1:06:04] a special pardon amen when we say
[1:06:07] a special grace and a special pardon
[1:06:11] this grace here is not a door
[1:06:14] to disgrace
[1:06:18] amen because it's very easy when the
[1:06:21] door of grace is open
[1:06:23] that somebody bring it as a disgrace
[1:06:27] let's go to genesis chapter 12.
[1:06:33] before you know it somebody will say hey
[1:06:35] i'm the head i can do this i can do this
[1:06:37] so you miss grace
[1:06:39] it is a grace that comes under emergency
[1:06:42] when everything is tight
[1:06:44] whenever thing is completely gone all
[1:06:47] hope are gone
[1:06:48] no more mercy everything is gone it
[1:06:51] comes
[1:06:52] in tight situation under emergency and
[1:06:55] it usually comes
[1:06:56] simple amen genesis chapter 12 if you're
[1:06:59] there you can say amen
[1:07:01] verse 10 and there was a famine in the
[1:07:04] land
[1:07:04] a tight situation happened to abraham
[1:07:07] anybody clear
[1:07:09] and abram went down into egypt he left
[1:07:12] the promised land
[1:07:14] a child of god and elect of god
[1:07:17] under pressure because of the touch
[1:07:20] situation
[1:07:21] left the promised land and went outside
[1:07:24] into the world
[1:07:27] to sojourn the day in other words to
[1:07:29] stay there temporarily
[1:07:31] for the famine was grievous in the land
[1:07:34] it's a test and he moved out
[1:07:37] and he came to pass when he was come
[1:07:39] near to enter
[1:07:40] into egypt that he said to sarah his
[1:07:44] wife
[1:07:44] behold now and know that you are a fair
[1:07:48] woman to look upon
[1:07:50] that beauty was on the face we're going
[1:07:52] to see that later on
[1:07:54] therefore it shall come to pass when the
[1:07:57] egyptians shall see you
[1:07:59] that they shall say this is his wife
[1:08:02] and they will kill me but they will save
[1:08:05] you alive
[1:08:06] or all these manipulations all these
[1:08:10] uh preparation of lies
[1:08:13] happen because somebody moved out of a
[1:08:16] position
[1:08:17] amen say i pray you
[1:08:20] you are my sister that he may be well
[1:08:24] remember
[1:08:24] i have a certain percentage of truth
[1:08:28] amendment that he may be well with me
[1:08:31] for your sake and my soul shall live
[1:08:33] because of you
[1:08:35] and it came to pass that when abraham
[1:08:38] was coming to egypt
[1:08:40] the egyptian beheld the woman that she
[1:08:42] was
[1:08:43] fair job told us what i fear is what
[1:08:46] happened to me
[1:08:47] amen the priest is also a pharaoh saw
[1:08:52] her
[1:08:52] and commanded her before pharaoh and the
[1:08:55] woman was taken in pharaoh's house
[1:08:59] and he treated abraham well
[1:09:02] for his sake and he had ship and
[1:09:05] oxen and he asses and men
[1:09:08] servants and made servants and she asses
[1:09:12] and camel prospering under a lie
[1:09:17] amen and the lord did water
[1:09:21] even though abraham is found in a tight
[1:09:25] corner
[1:09:28] amen he already messed up
[1:09:31] he already brought open a door to a
[1:09:34] spirit of life to his home
[1:09:37] even under that circumstances
[1:09:40] the promise of the covenant of god still
[1:09:43] stands sure
[1:09:47] amen the head of abraham responded
[1:09:51] and the lord plagued pharaoh and his
[1:09:54] house
[1:09:55] with great pledge because of who sarah
[1:09:58] abraham's wife and pharaoh called
[1:10:01] abraham
[1:10:02] and said to him what is this that you
[1:10:05] have done to me
[1:10:07] why did you not tell me that she was
[1:10:09] your wife
[1:10:10] why said you she is my sister so i might
[1:10:14] have taken her to me as a wife
[1:10:16] now therefore behold your wife take care
[1:10:20] and yo and go your way god protected
[1:10:23] sarah
[1:10:25] despite the error of abraham
[1:10:28] everybody so far go to genesis chapter
[1:10:32] 20.
[1:10:36] amen it's a special grace
[1:10:40] but it's not a door for disgrace
[1:10:43] amen genesis chapter 20. if you dare you
[1:10:47] can say amen
[1:10:49] i believe abraham learned from this
[1:10:51] mistake and he would not do that again
[1:10:55] amen and abraham journeyed from there
[1:10:58] toward the south country
[1:11:00] and dwell between kaddish and shu
[1:11:04] and sergeant in guerra and
[1:11:07] abraham said to who the second time
[1:11:11] again you thought he learned
[1:11:16] say to sarah his wife she is my sister
[1:11:20] and i'll be malek who
[1:11:23] so abimelech was a king
[1:11:29] as a king he was the head
[1:11:32] anybody in front of me of his country
[1:11:38] when the head move out opposition this
[1:11:41] is what happened
[1:11:42] an abimelech king of geralt said
[1:11:46] and took sarah but
[1:11:50] god came to abimelech in a dream
[1:11:54] by night and said to him be all you are
[1:11:57] but
[1:11:58] what god still come down
[1:12:01] to protect
[1:12:06] what a love for
[1:12:09] the woman which you have taken for she
[1:12:12] is
[1:12:13] a man's wife somebody else my wife in
[1:12:16] other words she's married
[1:12:18] but abimelech had not come near to work
[1:12:22] so god protected sarah
[1:12:25] right at the edge abraham already
[1:12:29] gave sarah out
[1:12:34] amen and
[1:12:38] had not come near here and he said lord
[1:12:41] will you slay also a water
[1:12:45] so the nation of abimelech was a water
[1:12:56] let's see what's going on amen
[1:13:00] say he not to me she is my sister
[1:13:03] and she even she herself said he is my
[1:13:07] brother in other words they both
[1:13:09] agreed to lie when ananias and sapphira
[1:13:13] did this god kill both of
[1:13:17] that's them but in the case of abraham
[1:13:20] god is lingering
[1:13:22] [Music]
[1:13:26] it's a grace not a door to disgrace
[1:13:30] amen
[1:13:32] he is my brother in the integrity of my
[1:13:36] heart
[1:13:37] and innocency of my hands have i done
[1:13:40] this
[1:13:41] verse 6 and god said to him in the dream
[1:13:45] yeah in other words god confirmed the
[1:13:48] heart of ability
[1:13:50] he said yes i know that you did this
[1:13:53] in the integrity of your heart for i
[1:13:57] also did whatever
[1:14:00] look at grace blocking protecting sarah
[1:14:03] i withheld you
[1:14:05] from sinning against me therefore
[1:14:08] allow i not to touch her
[1:14:12] now therefore restore the man his wife
[1:14:16] for he is a worker
[1:14:21] you don't play with prophets amen
[1:14:25] for he is the prophet and he shall pray
[1:14:28] for you
[1:14:29] and you shall leave and if you restore
[1:14:32] her not
[1:14:33] know you that you shall surely do what
[1:14:37] you and all that are
[1:14:40] therefore abimelech rose early in the
[1:14:42] morning
[1:14:43] and called all his servants and throwed
[1:14:46] all these things in their ears
[1:14:48] and the men were so refrained greatly
[1:14:50] afraid
[1:14:52] then abhimarra called abraham and said
[1:14:54] to him
[1:14:55] what have you done to us and what have i
[1:14:58] offended you
[1:14:59] that you have brought on me and on my
[1:15:02] kingdom a great water
[1:15:04] you have done deeds to me that ought not
[1:15:07] to be done you behave
[1:15:09] like like a sinner amen
[1:15:12] and air and abimelech said to abraham
[1:15:16] what saw you that you have done this
[1:15:20] thing
[1:15:22] amen in other words what is the reason
[1:15:24] why you did this
[1:15:26] tell me a little bit you come you lied
[1:15:27] to us now are we in trouble
[1:15:30] i just want to understand what happened
[1:15:31] why did you do this to me
[1:15:33] let's hear what abraham says amen
[1:15:37] this is where we sin many times amen
[1:15:40] and abraham said because i
[1:15:45] no benefit of that because i
[1:15:49] thought surely the fear of god is not
[1:15:54] in this this nation was a nation that
[1:15:58] was how
[1:16:03] i thought you look at me bad
[1:16:06] i touched you were angry to me i thought
[1:16:09] you didn't like me
[1:16:11] i thought and then you open the door and
[1:16:13] do something wrong
[1:16:15] presume i'm in the presumption
[1:16:19] amen that's why david said forgive me
[1:16:22] for presumption
[1:16:23] see amen you adventure
[1:16:27] without proof without authority
[1:16:30] amen i thought you were the fear of god
[1:16:34] is not in this place
[1:16:35] and they will slay me for my wife's sake
[1:16:39] and yet indeed she is my sister the
[1:16:42] little percentage
[1:16:44] she is the daughter of my father but not
[1:16:47] the daughter of
[1:16:48] my mother and she became my wife now the
[1:16:50] explanation is clear
[1:16:52] but you already told lie ever clear job
[1:16:55] to verse 17.
[1:16:56] so abraham prayed to god that god healed
[1:17:01] who
[1:17:02] so abhi malek was already sick
[1:17:05] god struck abimelech
[1:17:10] let me continue to hear abimelech
[1:17:15] and he's worked he was already married
[1:17:18] and still looking for another woman and
[1:17:20] got in trouble
[1:17:24] and his wife and his mad servant
[1:17:29] and they bought water not only was god
[1:17:33] angry to abimelech but god
[1:17:36] locked the seed of abimelech
[1:17:39] in case sarah is touched
[1:17:43] like will not function
[1:17:48] look how great it is for the lord
[1:17:52] has first closed up all the water
[1:17:56] warmth of the house of who because of
[1:17:59] sarah abraham walker
[1:18:02] when the head of the nation sinned
[1:18:05] amen that sin propagates all over
[1:18:13] amen it is a grace but it's not a great
[1:18:17] disgrace brother branham if you have
[1:18:21] time
[1:18:22] please explain matthew 10 verse 41
[1:18:26] i would like you to know what is a
[1:18:29] prophet he wrote
[1:18:31] jesus said whosoever receive a prophet
[1:18:35] in the name of a prophet receive the
[1:18:38] water
[1:18:40] a prophet rewards there is something
[1:18:43] loaded under that ministry a prophet
[1:18:46] reward is to be friend with them
[1:18:50] whosoever receive a righteous man in the
[1:18:53] name of a righteous man
[1:18:55] receive a righteous men's reward is that
[1:18:58] right
[1:18:59] and if they want to know what a prophet
[1:19:02] reward is
[1:19:03] is to be friend to the prophet see that
[1:19:06] is a reward he is your friend
[1:19:10] like the sunumat woman it might come
[1:19:13] handy sometime sometimes
[1:19:16] you're gonna find yourself in a tight
[1:19:19] corner
[1:19:20] and if you under a correct head
[1:19:24] under the proper message of your time
[1:19:28] if grace was granted to the messenger
[1:19:31] you have a right to claim that grace
[1:19:37] blessed be the name of the lord if this
[1:19:40] woman
[1:19:40] and i who never have seen each other
[1:19:44] in our lives if the holy spirit will
[1:19:46] reveal
[1:19:47] what the woman therefore what the woman
[1:19:50] is there for
[1:19:51] you know it shall have to be
[1:19:53] supernatural then
[1:19:56] if you believe it is a work
[1:19:59] you shall receive a worker
[1:20:04] if you call this message a devil
[1:20:08] if you disgrace the message you're going
[1:20:12] to receive the devil reward
[1:20:16] amen if you believe it is god
[1:20:20] you shall receive god's reward
[1:20:23] it is the way you approach a gift
[1:20:27] how many believe this message is from
[1:20:29] god
[1:20:30] may god grant you god's reward
[1:20:33] amen now here is the woman
[1:20:37] we are not the same age first time we
[1:20:40] have ever met
[1:20:41] never met you in my life know nothing
[1:20:44] about you
[1:20:44] and if god will reveal the secret in
[1:20:47] your heart to me
[1:20:48] then i shall have to come it shall have
[1:20:50] to come through some power
[1:20:52] but up to you too if you say it's the
[1:20:55] devil
[1:20:56] in other words when i'm discerning
[1:20:59] amen when god is giving me inspiration
[1:21:02] if you blaspheme against that
[1:21:08] then you get his reward you say it's god
[1:21:12] you shall get his reward so there is two
[1:21:14] rewards
[1:21:15] either you get the devil reward or you
[1:21:18] get god's
[1:21:19] reward amen we already read this let me
[1:21:22] skip this
[1:21:23] brother branham said the thing surprises
[1:21:25] me is the grace of god
[1:21:27] i have exhausted his mercy many times
[1:21:32] but i never can exhaust his grace
[1:21:36] and i'm so glad of that everybody clear
[1:21:39] so far
[1:21:40] where was he abraham blacks leader
[1:21:43] a little lion shasta is that right
[1:21:46] oh no there are no little white lies
[1:21:50] they are either black lives or they are
[1:21:52] not lies at all
[1:21:53] the man is sitting out there telling a
[1:21:56] pine blank lie
[1:22:00] saying that was his sister when he was
[1:22:02] his wife
[1:22:04] beating around the bush and backslid
[1:22:06] because he left the promised land
[1:22:08] and here was a righteous man standing
[1:22:11] before god
[1:22:12] and say lord you know my heart
[1:22:16] but i shall not hear your prayer
[1:22:18] abimelech
[1:22:20] take her back and let him pray for you
[1:22:23] he is my weapon i shall hear
[1:22:27] him not you yeah a
[1:22:30] best leader liar but that is
[1:22:33] my prophet
[1:22:38] hallelujah
[1:22:41] that's truth that is the bible
[1:22:45] now don't go plum too far over here
[1:22:49] on the calvinistic side wants in grace
[1:22:53] always in grace because you shall get in
[1:22:56] water
[1:22:57] don't get this as an open door to commit
[1:23:00] sin
[1:23:01] because an emergency grace is open to
[1:23:04] you
[1:23:05] that emergency grace you don't prepare
[1:23:08] for it
[1:23:10] you are trapped into something then god
[1:23:13] come down to rescue you
[1:23:16] hallelujah but i don't think just
[1:23:20] because you've done something wrong
[1:23:22] that you are gone forever you are a
[1:23:24] child of god
[1:23:25] you are born of the spirit of god you
[1:23:28] are sons and daughters of god
[1:23:30] and the fruits will bear record of
[1:23:32] itself
[1:23:33] there you are amen that's why paul
[1:23:36] in romans 6 said that what
[1:23:39] shall we say then shall we continue in
[1:23:42] sin
[1:23:43] that grace may abandon god forbid how
[1:23:48] shall we
[1:23:49] that are dead to sin live any longer
[1:23:52] therein in other words once you serve
[1:23:55] the worship and once purge have no more
[1:23:58] desire
[1:23:59] for sin but you can find yourself
[1:24:02] in a difficult situation where you are
[1:24:06] pushed under pressure to make a wrong
[1:24:08] judgment
[1:24:12] to get to a wrong option to go to a
[1:24:14] wrong
[1:24:15] door if you are predestinated then a
[1:24:18] special grace
[1:24:20] will be released to rescue you from that
[1:24:22] situation
[1:24:23] everybody here so far amen on sunday
[1:24:27] we talked about adam and eve
[1:24:31] we explained abraham and sarah we
[1:24:33] explained moses standing in the gap you
[1:24:36] saw that
[1:24:37] we spent moses and the letter of
[1:24:39] divorcement
[1:24:40] which paul was granted also the
[1:24:42] permission and brother branham came
[1:24:44] under the crowd and said for those that
[1:24:46] follow him
[1:24:48] amen that follow his message that have
[1:24:51] been messed up here is grace that came
[1:24:53] up amen blessed be the name of the lord
[1:24:56] we explain you joshua in the battle when
[1:24:59] the situation was tight
[1:25:00] joshua spoke to the son and god answered
[1:25:02] because he was in the line of duty
[1:25:05] now let's go on six with david and the
[1:25:08] shoe brain everybody clear so far
[1:25:10] look in the town and matthew 12 verse 1
[1:25:14] at that time jesus went the water
[1:25:19] the day of the sabbath in other words
[1:25:20] nobody's supposed to work
[1:25:23] through the cone and his disciples
[1:25:26] were hungry the law in the old testament
[1:25:30] says
[1:25:31] that if you hungry in israel if you
[1:25:34] passing through a field you have a right
[1:25:36] to enter that field
[1:25:38] and eat but don't pack anything home
[1:25:42] amen even if it doesn't belong to you if
[1:25:44] you're hungry
[1:25:45] you enter somebody else's field get the
[1:25:48] fruit eat
[1:25:48] the only thing don't pack it home what a
[1:25:51] god that provided things
[1:25:53] amen and his disciples were hungry
[1:25:56] and begin to plug the ear of god and to
[1:25:59] eat
[1:26:00] so the problem is not displacing and
[1:26:03] eating
[1:26:04] the problem is the sabbath day
[1:26:07] but when the pharisees saw it they say
[1:26:10] unto him
[1:26:11] behold that disciple do that which
[1:26:14] not allow food to do upon the water
[1:26:18] so they should be starving
[1:26:22] but he said unto them have ye
[1:26:25] not read what david did
[1:26:29] when he was working and
[1:26:32] they that were with him david
[1:26:36] was anointed by the prophet samuel
[1:26:40] as king of israel
[1:26:44] david was god anointed and saul was
[1:26:47] rejected
[1:26:48] in other words a new head of israel
[1:26:52] according to god was david
[1:26:56] but david was not alone he had
[1:27:00] people that were following him
[1:27:04] are you there so when david got in
[1:27:06] trouble
[1:27:08] into a that situation that he was hungry
[1:27:12] him and the people that follow him
[1:27:15] what happened how he entered
[1:27:18] into the house of who and did
[1:27:22] it the worker was devi the priest
[1:27:27] david was a prophet and a king not a
[1:27:30] priest
[1:27:31] and the showbread was only given to the
[1:27:33] priest
[1:27:34] but something opened the door that david
[1:27:38] entered there pulled the bread eat and
[1:27:40] nothing happened to david how he entered
[1:27:47] into the house of god
[1:27:48] and did eat the show bread which was
[1:27:51] not loveful for who this is jesus
[1:27:55] talking this is god telling you
[1:27:58] that what david did was not right
[1:28:05] which was not lawful for him to eat
[1:28:08] neither for what so it was not
[1:28:12] only good for david but for the people
[1:28:16] under david
[1:28:20] amen for them which were with him
[1:28:23] but only for the water so david was not
[1:28:27] a priest
[1:28:28] door closed the people that followed him
[1:28:31] were not preached door closed they in a
[1:28:33] type situation
[1:28:37] amen oh have you not read in the lord
[1:28:42] how that on the sabbath day the word
[1:28:46] over here the priests were justified
[1:28:49] and david was guilty over here
[1:28:52] the priests also are guilty
[1:28:57] have you not read in the lord how that
[1:29:00] on the sabbath day
[1:29:01] the priests in the temple do work
[1:29:05] profane the sabbath and i welcome
[1:29:08] a special grace was given to the priest
[1:29:12] that even if it's sabbath day he can do
[1:29:16] work and nothing happened to him
[1:29:18] amen a special grace was given to david
[1:29:22] that even though he's not qualified
[1:29:25] to eat the shortbread because he's under
[1:29:28] emergency
[1:29:30] he's followed by soul god open a grace
[1:29:33] not only for him but for the people
[1:29:37] that are following him that's why
[1:29:39] brother branham said for those that
[1:29:41] follow
[1:29:42] me and paul said
[1:29:45] follow me as i follow christ
[1:29:49] when paul gets a reward that's why
[1:29:51] brother branham said
[1:29:52] if those of paul entered my nose
[1:29:56] my center
[1:29:57] [Applause]
[1:30:01] hallelujah the priest on the sabbath day
[1:30:06] they also prophet the summer
[1:30:10] look at this case here brother branham
[1:30:13] if a man has been married and what
[1:30:18] i told you it's like i'm preaching
[1:30:19] marriage and divorce
[1:30:21] and divorce isn't that lawful
[1:30:25] see so many now i'm not saying nothing
[1:30:27] against the people
[1:30:29] just that is on the people's mind
[1:30:32] this is what i'm talking sure they are
[1:30:35] working
[1:30:36] the rapture people use not to think so
[1:30:40] much about that
[1:30:42] it was not so much of it but now
[1:30:45] it is just plastered the world
[1:30:48] it just plastered the world and the
[1:30:51] people
[1:30:52] read these things in the and
[1:30:55] people who elected
[1:30:59] out there is coming in to look at it
[1:31:02] and they see it and they are working
[1:31:05] brother branham is saying that the time
[1:31:08] of the coming of the lord is joy near
[1:31:10] the rapture is at hand and the elect of
[1:31:14] god
[1:31:15] has found themselves in some difficult
[1:31:18] time situation that they don't know how
[1:31:21] to get out of it
[1:31:22] now they look at the scripture and it
[1:31:25] looks like the scripture
[1:31:26] is condemning them yet something in them
[1:31:30] is yearning for god it looks like
[1:31:33] grace is finished for them it looks like
[1:31:37] their situation of marriage
[1:31:39] have cornered them to the point that
[1:31:41] they qualify to go to hell
[1:31:43] now they're coming to brother branham to
[1:31:46] ask
[1:31:47] questions and understanding the proper
[1:31:51] head
[1:31:51] of brother brother as a messenger of the
[1:31:55] age
[1:31:55] as the correct head of the edge
[1:31:59] he must give an answer

[1:32:04] zeloped
[1:32:06] do you remember them they went to moses
[1:32:08] they say
[1:32:09] our father was not in the company of
[1:32:12] quran

[1:32:20] we never rejected your message we stood
[1:32:24] by you
[1:32:24] we have a situation moses went back to
[1:32:28] god
[1:32:28] and god opened the door and granted to
[1:32:31] those daughters

[1:32:56] they want to know that is the reason
[1:32:59] i want to answer it but branham is not
[1:33:01] answering this for the serpentine
[1:33:04] he's answering this for the what for the
[1:33:06] elect
[1:33:08] amen now as an elect approaches
[1:33:11] an answer must be given to amen they
[1:33:14] want to know
[1:33:15] that's the reason i want to answer it
[1:33:17] just as
[1:33:18] with much sense to it as i can give it
[1:33:21] to you
[1:33:22] brother branham now answers no he
[1:33:24] continued reading the
[1:33:26] the question has been married and
[1:33:28] divorced
[1:33:29] and then remarried a woman who has also
[1:33:32] been married
[1:33:33] and divorced and then married to him and
[1:33:35] they and these two
[1:33:37] married in god's side are they married
[1:33:39] in god's side
[1:33:40] how can both of both or one of them be
[1:33:43] in the rapture
[1:33:46] i'm going to explain you this the man
[1:33:49] was married
[1:33:51] a man divorced the woman was married
[1:33:57] divorced they already troubled both of
[1:34:00] them
[1:34:01] then they met together and they're
[1:34:03] married
[1:34:06] the curse is easy because you can break
[1:34:09] this marriage
[1:34:10] and everybody goes free but in their
[1:34:12] cases
[1:34:13] they already have children
[1:34:16] you gets more complicated if you
[1:34:19] separate this marriage
[1:34:21] where are the kids gonna go because the
[1:34:24] kids
[1:34:25] the woman is under adultery married two
[1:34:28] men again living under adultery
[1:34:30] their kids and the adultery if you split
[1:34:33] this to say
[1:34:34] go back go back what about the children
[1:34:37] they are born under
[1:34:38] adultery how can we rescue such a
[1:34:41] situation
[1:34:44] that's why you need a proper head amen
[1:34:48] brother brandon help us how now brother
[1:34:51] branham mentioned
[1:34:53] i don't know this is the message of the
[1:34:56] head
[1:34:58] i don't know i could not tell you the
[1:35:01] question is
[1:35:02] can they be in the water why
[1:35:05] are they asking that because they look
[1:35:08] they find that based on the scripture
[1:35:10] there is no way we can be in the rapture
[1:35:13] because we already messed up we messed
[1:35:15] up and we messed up again
[1:35:20] divorce each one of them divorced
[1:35:23] each one of them has a living companion
[1:35:26] then they're married again both of them
[1:35:29] married again
[1:35:30] now is that woman still alive yes
[1:35:34] is the man still alive yes oh my god if
[1:35:37] they were dead
[1:35:38] no problem so you you're free they're
[1:35:40] still alive and sometimes they take
[1:35:41] longer before they die
[1:35:50] hallelujah brother branham say a crow
[1:35:52] lives longer
[1:35:54] he lives longer you wear that you say
[1:35:57] lord let him die so
[1:35:58] so so i can marry they don't die that's
[1:36:01] why young people before you get married
[1:36:03] make sure you pray
[1:36:07] are you there the woman has a living
[1:36:10] husband
[1:36:11] the man a living one and now they got
[1:36:14] children
[1:36:15] and so forth and want to come to water
[1:36:18] when they look at their situation it's
[1:36:20] like the devil is telling me
[1:36:21] them don't even fool to go to church you
[1:36:24] better stay at home because you will
[1:36:25] never go to heaven but something in
[1:36:28] them like the sorrow phoenician woman
[1:36:31] that tag is is kind of pulling
[1:36:36] amen can they go
[1:36:39] in the rapture that shall be up to the
[1:36:42] heavenly father
[1:36:44] i could not answer that see i saw one
[1:36:47] thing
[1:36:47] look how the prophet cornered them i saw
[1:36:50] one thing
[1:36:51] the bible say that they shall be called
[1:36:54] enough
[1:36:56] brother branham is condemning them
[1:36:59] as a messenger amen he's not going to
[1:37:03] condone or compromise
[1:37:06] amen jesus never said that the woman was
[1:37:10] not caught in adultery
[1:37:13] he never said that because the evidence
[1:37:16] is there and the word always will
[1:37:18] correct the error
[1:37:20] so brother branham must acknowledge that
[1:37:22] first of all they are due
[1:37:24] [Music]
[1:37:26] are you there this message
[1:37:30] if you don't understand that just pray
[1:37:31] accept it and move forward
[1:37:33] it is not complicated amen the bible
[1:37:37] says that they shall be called an
[1:37:38] adulterer and the bible said also
[1:37:42] an adulterer will work not
[1:37:45] enter in the kingdom of in other words
[1:37:48] the man that put the question say oh my
[1:37:50] god that's exactly what i was thinking
[1:37:53] the man that we thought is gonna tell us
[1:37:55] something he's cornering us
[1:37:57] amen that is all
[1:38:00] that i can say about here remember the
[1:38:04] sorrow venetian woman
[1:38:05] when she approached jesus jesus called
[1:38:08] her first as a dog
[1:38:10] but she have to accept
[1:38:16] have to accept the category
[1:38:20] god put her under if god
[1:38:23] said you are a dog don't call yourself
[1:38:26] something and say yes master
[1:38:28] i accept the dog
[1:38:32] do you understand so brother branham is
[1:38:34] telling them that you are
[1:38:36] doomed according to the scripture there
[1:38:38] is no way you can get to heaven
[1:38:43] yes lord accepted amen
[1:38:46] that's all i can say i know that just
[1:38:50] kills me i'm preaching marriage and
[1:38:53] divorce almost if you take these three
[1:38:55] three sermons and the one following you
[1:38:56] will see all marriage and divorce
[1:38:58] preaching
[1:38:58] amen that just kills me to say that
[1:39:03] but i can't say but what the water
[1:39:07] i must stay with water i cannot
[1:39:10] compromise
[1:39:11] i must tell you the truth that you are
[1:39:13] doomed
[1:39:16] that's the first phase watch william
[1:39:19] marion branham
[1:39:20] pulling the emergency bullet now
[1:39:24] you want to read it you want to see that
[1:39:27] you want to see the emergency bullet
[1:39:29] watch that he continued
[1:39:33] i'm not advising you please let me just
[1:39:36] give you a little scripture
[1:39:40] i thought he condemned them
[1:39:43] please please don't if you are living
[1:39:47] happy with your this is 64.
[1:39:52] he have not preached marriage and
[1:39:53] divorce here

[1:40:00] if you are happy with your husband
[1:40:04] living happy with your wife please
[1:40:07] remain what
[1:40:10] which authority are you using brother
[1:40:12] brother
[1:40:14] with you just for because i told you
[1:40:17] that
[1:40:18] don't leave them leader the complexity
[1:40:21] is the children
[1:40:23] when brother brother gave the scripture
[1:40:25] it looks like
[1:40:26] both of them need to separate them but
[1:40:28] the kids are locked where are they going
[1:40:30] to go
[1:40:30] they're trying to live godly amen
[1:40:33] brother branham now he's saying no no no
[1:40:35] no stay there
[1:40:36] because of the kids which scripture do
[1:40:39] you have brother brother
[1:40:40] amen don't leave them lead the children
[1:40:43] without a home
[1:40:45] and things like that god
[1:40:48] has made the restitutions in places for
[1:40:52] people
[1:40:53] that did things water
[1:40:56] you remember jesus said emergency bullet
[1:41:01] of david when he was what
[1:41:04] you see the scripture how it's used now
[1:41:08] you see now when david when he was
[1:41:11] hungry
[1:41:11] he enter into the temple of god
[1:41:14] and eat the shoe bread which is only
[1:41:17] lawful for the priest
[1:41:19] and found work the priest also
[1:41:22] blasphemed the sabbath upon the sabbath
[1:41:25] day
[1:41:25] and i found water and a greater than the
[1:41:29] sabbath was there
[1:41:32] let's just leave it up to god and go
[1:41:35] ahead
[1:41:36] and just leave that way just leave for
[1:41:39] water
[1:41:41] there might be a chance of you getting
[1:41:44] water
[1:41:46] you see that that's why when he preached
[1:41:49] marriage and divorce he said
[1:41:51] he forgave you like they give moses a
[1:41:53] permission
[1:41:54] they give paulie permission they also
[1:41:57] give me a permission
[1:41:58] only thing teach your children not to do
[1:42:01] that again but that's for you that's
[1:42:04] because you are an elective you gotta be
[1:42:06] rescued
[1:42:09] there might be a chance of you getting
[1:42:12] in dog
[1:42:13] two wrongs will never righten you just
[1:42:15] go on and live the way you are
[1:42:17] if you are happy together you might have
[1:42:19] the wrong companion
[1:42:21] if i i shall say this one thing if you
[1:42:24] got the wrong companion in this wife in
[1:42:28] this life
[1:42:29] you shall never have it in the other
[1:42:32] all wrong will be water it's a tough
[1:42:35] situation
[1:42:36] hang on with the husband when we go to
[1:42:38] the rapture
[1:42:39] you're gonna understand who you are
[1:42:40] supposed to marry
[1:42:45] are you there are you there we saw on
[1:42:48] sunday david
[1:42:50] and the three choices when god told him
[1:42:52] to
[1:42:53] to to choose one of them david
[1:42:56] never chose any he said let me fall in
[1:42:59] the hand of god
[1:43:00] now let's go with david and nathan and
[1:43:03] look at what's going on
[1:43:04] in second samuel chapter 11 verse 2
[1:43:08] we good and it came to pass in the
[1:43:11] evening todd we know this that david
[1:43:13] rose from office bed and walked up on
[1:43:16] the roof of the king's house
[1:43:17] and from the roof he saw a woman washing
[1:43:20] herself
[1:43:21] by shiva and the woman was very
[1:43:23] beautiful to look on
[1:43:25] when the scripture said beautiful they
[1:43:27] always say look on
[1:43:28] look on look on look on look on
[1:43:32] and you're gonna see why jezebel painted
[1:43:34] her face
[1:43:36] amen and david sent
[1:43:40] an inquirer after the woman and once
[1:43:43] said
[1:43:44] it is this is not this bathsheba
[1:43:47] in other words they warn him just like
[1:43:49] the other time
[1:43:50] when he won a number he's a job warning
[1:43:53] he seems like david have a problem with
[1:43:55] hard-headed amen
[1:43:57] the daughter of helium the wife of uriah
[1:43:59] at the high time
[1:44:00] and david sent messenger and took her
[1:44:03] and she came in unto him
[1:44:05] and he lay with her and she was purified
[1:44:07] from her uncleanness and she returned
[1:44:09] onto her
[1:44:10] house everybody so far second samuel
[1:44:13] chapter 12
[1:44:15] nathan came the woman got pregnant
[1:44:18] nathan came and give a parable he says
[1:44:21] there was a rich man
[1:44:22] you know the parable and the poor man
[1:44:24] and this is what happened
[1:44:25] and david anger kindled he didn't know
[1:44:28] what he was watch what's going on amen
[1:44:32] and david's anger was greatly kinder
[1:44:36] against the water who was the man
[1:44:42] okay and he said to nathan
[1:44:46] as the lord of the lord the man
[1:44:51] who is the man that has done
[1:44:54] these things that surely what
[1:44:58] who was david the king of israel the
[1:45:02] head of israel he consented
[1:45:05] for his own death the first penalty
[1:45:09] of this man is death
[1:45:12] anybody clear verse six
[1:45:16] and he shall restore the water
[1:45:19] the lamb how many times if he killed one
[1:45:24] he he he's gonna have four
[1:45:27] of his family killed
[1:45:33] we understand okay
[1:45:36] where was daddy he shall restore the
[1:45:39] lamb
[1:45:39] thoughtful because he did things
[1:45:43] and because he had no pity and david
[1:45:47] verse 13 nathan turned around he said
[1:45:50] you know the man
[1:45:51] it is you and david verse 13
[1:45:55] and david said unto nathan i have sinned
[1:45:58] against the law
[1:46:00] and nathan say unto david
[1:46:03] the lord also has put away that
[1:46:07] that shall not work
[1:46:10] god erased the first one
[1:46:14] he left this the son
[1:46:18] that was born from that

[1:46:24] emon died
[1:46:27] absalom died i don't know
[1:46:33] four
[1:46:36] amen david was supposed also to die
[1:46:42] message of grace david said the man will
[1:46:45] pay for
[1:46:46] his life that dog prophet
[1:46:49] the head of the agent that's all
[1:46:53] prophet them eyes narrow down
[1:46:57] brother branham now is looking at the
[1:46:59] scene and he says
[1:47:01] when david was so angry the prophet
[1:47:04] luke and david said he doesn't
[1:47:06] understand what he's doing
[1:47:08] he's condemning himself and because the
[1:47:12] prophet was the prophet of the age
[1:47:14] nathan the prophet reached out to his
[1:47:17] bed
[1:47:18] and pulled the emergency bullet quickly
[1:47:20] for david
[1:47:26] them eyes narrowed down he said
[1:47:29] devin surely you shall not die
[1:47:33] watch what
[1:47:37] quick the spirit struck the prophet
[1:47:42] self-device life when david pronounced
[1:47:46] judgment an anointing came and told me
[1:47:49] quickly save death itself does it
[1:47:52] quickly and let them use the bullet and
[1:47:54] say oh you're not going to die
[1:47:59] watch dress go out to work work with the
[1:48:01] spirit struck the prophet save david's
[1:48:04] life

[1:48:09] sword will not leave your house
[1:48:11] till it's totally purged your heart for
[1:48:13] you are the rich man
[1:48:15] oh it was a different then wasn't it
[1:48:18] what saved david when his own judgment
[1:48:22] say the man will die he shall pay to the
[1:48:25] other most
[1:48:26] and he shall pay for it with his life
[1:48:28] then and the prophets say
[1:48:31] surely what you shall not
[1:48:34] you shall not die david grace has saved
[1:48:37] you
[1:48:38] he was graced to death that saved him
[1:48:42] oh my if he had not been for grace
[1:48:45] where would we all be it's certainly
[1:48:49] right
[1:48:49] it's that right certainly when
[1:48:52] david already pronounced himself dead
[1:48:56] grace stepping and watch you dabbing
[1:48:59] from there
[1:49:01] amen it's a grace under the head
[1:49:05] only nathan have that bullet because
[1:49:07] he's the messenger to the age
[1:49:09] let's look at the lever and the passover
[1:49:13] are you there still a few minutes and
[1:49:16] then
[1:49:16] ii chronicle chapter 30 verse 17 and
[1:49:19] there were
[1:49:20] many in the congregation that were not
[1:49:24] israel they were trying to put things in
[1:49:26] order in the book of the chronicle
[1:49:28] they must eat the passover when they
[1:49:30] want to eat the passover
[1:49:32] many people were still unclaimed they
[1:49:34] were not sanctified what are we going to
[1:49:35] do because israel is trying to
[1:49:37] correct its way into uh toward god
[1:49:42] and there were many in the congregation
[1:49:44] that were not sanctified
[1:49:46] therefore the levite had the charge of
[1:49:48] the killing of the passover
[1:49:50] for everyone that was not clean to
[1:49:52] sanctify them unto the lord so the
[1:49:54] leaver took charge to make sure the
[1:49:56] people are clean
[1:49:58] for a multitude of the people even many
[1:50:01] of
[1:50:01] ephraim and manasseh issachar
[1:50:04] and zebulun had not cleaned themselves
[1:50:08] yet you follow me did they eat
[1:50:12] the water otherwise
[1:50:15] then it was written normally
[1:50:18] they were not supposed to take the
[1:50:20] lord's supper
[1:50:22] you follow me but they look at the
[1:50:25] circumstances
[1:50:27] and they take time that was there they
[1:50:30] say
[1:50:30] allow the people to go ahead and get it
[1:50:33] yes
[1:50:33] brother kevin look at this grace yet the
[1:50:37] day
[1:50:37] is the passover otherwise then it was
[1:50:39] written
[1:50:40] but hezekiah who was hezekiah
[1:50:44] the head prayed for them
[1:50:47] saying the good luck do what
[1:50:51] remember when a woman take a power under
[1:50:54] her
[1:50:55] father her father have a right to
[1:50:57] disallow the vow and god will do what
[1:51:00] pardon when a husband a wife taken foul
[1:51:03] the husband has a right to cancel that
[1:51:06] and the god will do what
[1:51:08] hezekiah use that partner
[1:51:12] because they don't know what to do
[1:51:14] they're in the tax situation
[1:51:15] the people are in the city consensus
[1:51:17] where they are they must honor the
[1:51:19] passover
[1:51:20] he said lord forgive them
[1:51:23] their heart they try to make things
[1:51:25] right but the situation is tight
[1:51:28] just come on up lord pound on everyone
[1:51:32] that prepare his work the condition
[1:51:36] is here
[1:51:39] you got a minute from your heart
[1:51:43] amen in other words the mistake you find
[1:51:46] yourself in
[1:51:47] is by ignorance the mistake you found
[1:51:51] yourself
[1:51:51] in is something that you were under
[1:51:55] pressure
[1:51:55] like the man he could not stand before
[1:51:58] the bullet brother branham said that's
[1:51:59] why he run
[1:52:01] the mistake is under pressure you don't
[1:52:03] mean it's not
[1:52:04] iniquity
[1:52:09] to prepare prepare his heart to seek god
[1:52:13] the lord god of his father though he be
[1:52:16] not what
[1:52:17] according to the purification of the
[1:52:20] sanctuary
[1:52:21] and the lord did what to whom
[1:52:25] and did what they took the passover
[1:52:28] without being totally clean
[1:52:30] because they had to use an emergency
[1:52:32] bullet say god
[1:52:34] you know their heart they're just trying
[1:52:36] the best that they can
[1:52:38] they're struggling but please help them
[1:52:41] god say i understand there's a kaya let
[1:52:42] them take it
[1:52:46] hallelujah jesus said the adulterous
[1:52:49] woman we already explained this
[1:52:52] jesus said the fifth of the cross the
[1:52:55] fifth of the cross
[1:52:56] was there you know the story the other
[1:52:59] fifth was mocking jesus
[1:53:01] he looked he said wait a minute you
[1:53:03] cannot mock this man
[1:53:04] me and you we are guilty we did things
[1:53:07] that were wrong
[1:53:08] but not this man but just what he
[1:53:11] said he turned around he said lord
[1:53:16] do whatever can i have a crumb of mercy
[1:53:23] father i'm already doomed in few minutes
[1:53:26] i'm gonna die because the roman will
[1:53:28] come
[1:53:29] pack experience to me break my legs i
[1:53:32] will die
[1:53:32] but please before i go would you please
[1:53:36] have a club
[1:53:37] maybe a small grace maybe that small
[1:53:40] bullet
[1:53:41] and when jesus was dying he was dying as
[1:53:44] a sinner and the peanut of fire already
[1:53:47] left him
[1:53:48] that's why he was crying my father my
[1:53:51] father
[1:53:51] well why have that forsaken me even in
[1:53:55] that stage
[1:53:56] jesus kept a bullet in his pocket
[1:53:59] amen when he was at the last time
[1:54:02] he looked he said wait a minute this is
[1:54:05] a predestinated seat
[1:54:07] he said no wonder i kept a bullet he
[1:54:10] pulled the bullet
[1:54:11] he said today me and you we're going
[1:54:14] into water
[1:54:16] normally normally a
[1:54:19] man that was safe in that time should be
[1:54:21] baptized
[1:54:23] because john the baptist already
[1:54:25] introduced baptism
[1:54:27] but at the cross it's an emergency case
[1:54:30] there is no way to get involved baptized
[1:54:34] so right where you are just take follow
[1:54:37] me
[1:54:37] get it this way don't open and open the
[1:54:40] door upgrade
[1:54:42] amen
[1:54:43] [Applause]
[1:54:46] hallelujah recognizing the head
[1:54:50] jesus christ by recognizing the head
[1:54:53] even in that agony there was still a
[1:54:56] bullet
[1:54:56] to save somebody and bypass the world of
[1:54:59] baptism
[1:55:00] and get him to heaven hallelujah
[1:55:04] because there was no time brother
[1:55:05] branham said to get that man prepared
[1:55:07] again
[1:55:08] and go to the water baptism that time
[1:55:10] was he's he's in the death
[1:55:12] in the hospital he gotta die we cannot
[1:55:14] take him from the
[1:55:15] from the icu and put him in the water
[1:55:17] right there going to heaven
[1:55:20] hallelujah paul and othnesimos let's go
[1:55:24] to pharlemon
[1:55:25] then we're going to finish
[1:55:29] i have seven minutes left according to
[1:55:32] my time
[1:55:35] amen let's go to phalemon
[1:55:39] taliman if you go to second team until
[1:55:44] you finish
[1:55:45] you're going to go to tardis after
[1:55:46] tardis falling on
[1:55:48] just to help somebody get it quickly
[1:55:53] amen you there
[1:55:58] if you don't know where it is go to
[1:55:59] second timothy if you found timothy
[1:56:01] first second
[1:56:02] after second timothy status after titus
[1:56:05] it's parliament
[1:56:06] that's why you need to train yourself in
[1:56:08] a scripture
[1:56:10] amen funny moment everybody there
[1:56:14] verse uh there is only one verse there
[1:56:18] one chapter there let's go to verse 10.
[1:56:22] as a background
[1:56:26] phallemon had a slave
[1:56:32] that slave was called on azimus
[1:56:37] and that slave ran away from his master
[1:56:42] and probably he he stole something or
[1:56:44] what and run away
[1:56:46] then when he ran away he went away from
[1:56:49] his master
[1:56:50] in rome or something he met paul and
[1:56:53] paul preached the gospel
[1:56:55] and the man got converted
[1:56:58] now in in the way of correcting his life
[1:57:02] paul told him go back to your master
[1:57:06] just like hagar disrespecting sarah
[1:57:09] the angel of the lord said go back stay
[1:57:12] home and respect
[1:57:13] sarah amen so paul said go ahead
[1:57:17] and go back over there but the master is
[1:57:20] probably angry
[1:57:22] because you stole something and you ran
[1:57:23] away so
[1:57:25] paul now as the messenger is pulling
[1:57:28] a bullet to help on the zimmers go back
[1:57:31] to his
[1:57:32] normal estate clear now
[1:57:35] verse 10 i beseech you he's talking to
[1:57:38] falima
[1:57:39] who was the owner i beseech you
[1:57:43] for my
[1:57:44] [Music]
[1:57:46] was on a zemo's son to paul
[1:57:50] he was son in the gospel
[1:57:53] now paul uses my son
[1:57:57] he's loading his bullet pretty good
[1:58:00] he said philemon i'm sending somebody
[1:58:03] but that person is my son i beseech you
[1:58:06] for my son onesimus
[1:58:08] whom i have begotten in my water
[1:58:12] in other words i got him to the lord and
[1:58:14] he's born again while i'm in prison
[1:58:17] he's my son in the gospel which in time
[1:58:20] passed was to you whatever
[1:58:24] he was not useful to you anymore you
[1:58:27] already doomed with he
[1:58:29] i mean him to your presence he's doomed
[1:58:32] if he alimon probably found him he can
[1:58:34] kill him
[1:58:37] doom who in time passed was to you
[1:58:40] i'm profitable but now profitable to who
[1:58:45] to you and who he associated him
[1:58:49] remember moses when israel got in
[1:58:52] trouble
[1:58:53] moses said to the lord before you killed
[1:58:56] if you don't forgive them kill me take
[1:58:59] my name out of the book of life he knew
[1:59:01] his name was in the book of life god
[1:59:03] won't take it
[1:59:04] take my name out and then god repented
[1:59:08] so paul is saying if i send on the
[1:59:10] symbols it's going to be tough for him
[1:59:12] let me use my signet let me use
[1:59:16] the ring of the king and let me put that
[1:59:19] connect that to honesty must so when he
[1:59:21] sees
[1:59:22] that ring is telling him something amen
[1:59:26] which in time passed was to you
[1:59:29] unprofitable
[1:59:30] but now profitable to you and me
[1:59:34] whom i have sent again you therefore do
[1:59:38] what
[1:59:39] receive him that is my own water
[1:59:43] whom i would have returned with me
[1:59:47] that in your stead he might have
[1:59:49] ministered to me
[1:59:51] in the bonds of the gospel normally he's
[1:59:54] a good boy now
[1:59:55] i should have kept him with me so that
[1:59:57] we can preach the gospel with him
[1:59:59] but i am sending him back to you he's
[2:00:02] youthful in other words
[2:00:04] amen but verse 14 without your mind
[2:00:08] will not not do nothing i cannot do
[2:00:11] something like this without telling
[2:00:12] anybody
[2:00:15] amen that your benefit should not be as
[2:00:19] aware of necessity but water
[2:00:22] i don't want you to do this as a duty i
[2:00:25] want i'm i'm calling to your heart
[2:00:27] for you to understand i want this to
[2:00:29] come from your own heart or the
[2:00:31] pharma amen for perhaps
[2:00:35] he therefore departed for a water
[2:00:39] that you should receive him for what
[2:00:42] paul is telling philemon
[2:00:44] this prisoner could have depart from you
[2:00:47] forever
[2:00:48] so god allowed him to go like that
[2:00:51] because god wanted him to serve you
[2:00:55] for the whole life but god sent in on
[2:00:58] azimus
[2:00:59] a wrong spirit so for god to preserve
[2:01:03] your worker
[2:01:04] he allowed him to go so that me paul can
[2:01:08] handle him
[2:01:09] clean him up for you prepare him
[2:01:12] correctly
[2:01:13] and bring him to you so that at this
[2:01:15] point he's going to remain
[2:01:16] faithful to you all the way to death
[2:01:20] sometimes some have to go and get
[2:01:23] prepared and come back radically
[2:01:28] hallelujah for perhaps
[2:01:31] he therefore departed for a season that
[2:01:34] you should receive him forever
[2:01:37] not now as a worker but
[2:01:40] above a servant a brother
[2:01:43] beloved especially to me
[2:01:47] look how he's bringing a orders
[2:01:50] but how much more to you buff in
[2:01:54] flesh and in the water now he's not just
[2:01:57] your servant he believes the same god
[2:01:59] like you
[2:02:00] so in a different way he's also your
[2:02:02] brother so you can sit down
[2:02:04] and fellowship with him the things that
[2:02:06] you were not supposed to fellowship with
[2:02:08] him before
[2:02:09] amen if you can't meet there for a while
[2:02:14] look how moses is inserting himself
[2:02:18] if you can't meet there for a partner
[2:02:21] receive him as what i'm pulling now paul
[2:02:25] is now
[2:02:25] putting himself out like philemon go
[2:02:28] ahead and refuse me
[2:02:31] you know what i did for you right you
[2:02:33] know how i save you
[2:02:34] you know how i preach you the gospel you
[2:02:36] know how i handle you
[2:02:37] so treat me bad if you can
[2:02:41] amen if you can't meet there for a
[2:02:45] partner
[2:02:46] receive him as myself if he had done
[2:02:50] what
[2:02:51] wrong you or all you water
[2:02:55] anything put that on my water
[2:02:59] this is the spirit of christ
[2:03:05] the door of all the symbols to the house
[2:03:08] of philemon was
[2:03:09] closed but paul under the anointing of
[2:03:13] christ
[2:03:14] is approaching saying if there is
[2:03:16] anything they did father
[2:03:18] lay those charge on me i died there the
[2:03:21] cross for them
[2:03:22] i took their penalty put that on me go
[2:03:24] ahead and kill me
[2:03:25] strip me at the cross put me naked over
[2:03:29] there in the cross but at least
[2:03:30] let this one pass amen
[2:03:34] if he has wronged you i owe you anything
[2:03:37] put that on my account
[2:03:39] i paul have written it with my own work
[2:03:43] the signet of mordecai i put myself
[2:03:46] i want to see how you're going to refuse
[2:03:48] this
[2:03:49] amen i'm writing this with my own hand
[2:03:53] i will do what do you think philemon had
[2:03:56] the gut to tell paul
[2:03:57] go ahead and pay me my money back
[2:04:02] do you think so paul will tell him that
[2:04:05] if i preach you the gospel
[2:04:07] your your belonging you ought to share
[2:04:10] with me
[2:04:12] so you actually owe me because i'm
[2:04:15] working as a tent maker
[2:04:16] i don't want to get that
[2:04:21] amen apple have written it with my own
[2:04:26] hand
[2:04:26] i won't repay it i'll beat i do not say
[2:04:29] to you how you owe me what
[2:04:31] what for how you owe me even your own
[2:04:36] normally you will you you belong to me
[2:04:40] i didn't claim you that now for what you
[2:04:44] owe me
[2:04:44] remember put that on there in other
[2:04:46] words let's cancel the card
[2:04:48] let's cancel that i cancel yours you
[2:04:51] cancel the one i send you right so zero
[2:04:53] zero get him
[2:04:54] amen brother
[2:04:57] let me have joy of you in the water
[2:05:01] refresh my power in the lord having
[2:05:04] confidence in your work
[2:05:07] remember the man that was approaching
[2:05:09] abraham lincoln
[2:05:10] he said i know you don't want to condone
[2:05:12] the death of a man
[2:05:14] amen paul say i know your obedience in
[2:05:17] other words
[2:05:17] you're going to do what i'm telling you
[2:05:18] to do amen having confidence in your
[2:05:21] opinion
[2:05:22] i wrote to you knowing that you will
[2:05:24] also
[2:05:25] do more than what

[2:05:33] mother factor i will come to visit you
[2:05:35] to make sure you treat him pretty good
[2:05:41] what do you think honestly will do

[2:05:49] one time
[2:05:50] was with sister media amen
[2:05:54] and media under pressure joseph did
[2:05:57] something
[2:05:58] media was chasing joseph coming up there
