[31:49] The Duality of the word of God Amen The
[31:53] Duality with Jesus Christ The Duality
[31:56] with brother brandham now The Duality
[31:59] for you and me people need to see Jesus
[32:02] reflecting through US amen when I woke
[32:06] up this morning I open my bible and I
[32:08] fell in U Psalm 67 and I was reading and
[32:12] it looks like I saw something new this
[32:14] Bible keep changing every day amen I'm
[32:17] going to just read couple of them the
[32:19] Bible says maybe three of them let the
[32:22] people praise thee Oh God let all the
[32:26] people praise the
[32:28] then after the Praises shall the Earth
[32:32] yield her
[32:33] increase and God even our own God shall
[32:38] bless us praise am Praise Him you praise
[32:43] him you praise him then as you praising
[32:45] him amen the Earth whatever you have
[32:49] will begin to grow and God even your own
[32:52] God will bless you amen and the Bible
[32:55] says God shall bless bless us and all
[32:58] the ends of the Earth shall fear
[33:03] him so one way for the fear of the Lord
[33:06] to be upon the people is the way God is
[33:08] blessing you I'm reading the Bible it's
[33:11] in Psalm 67 verse uh five all the way to
[33:15] verse 7 the way God blesses you he
[33:19] brings the fear of the Lord upon the
[33:21] people then the people knows that these
[33:23] people that we call Brat even though we
[33:25] are not brat by those people God is
[33:28] blessing them we can see the power of
[33:31] God in their life and the people begin
[33:33] to respect God because of the way God is
[33:35] dealing with you because there is a
[33:37] duality of the word amen when the people
[33:41] see you they begin to wonder where they
[33:43] you either Jesus or not yes we are
[33:46] Messiah we are Jesus in the female
[33:49] version amen so don't forget your
[33:51] Praises when you praise when you praise
[33:53] the God your God will bless you amen

[41:49] hour has arrived that when we must bring
[41:53] his word to a
[41:54] showdown ah
[41:57] huh you don't have to back off of no
[41:59] devil no demons no sickness is that

[42:16] it on us he said now we got to bring he
[42:20] says bring God to a test as it is
[42:23] written in the Book of Malachi say the
[42:26] Lord prove me say God what a challenge
[42:30] said what a challenge look at what
[42:32] brother Brandon was saying it what a
[42:34] challenge prove me it is written that we
[42:37] should prove all things is that that and
[42:40] we read in the Bible that it is written
[42:43] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[42:46] today and forever and that he promised
[42:50] the church that what he did they would
[42:53] do after him oh my he says we are told
[42:58] by the prophets that there would be a
[43:00] day that would not be day nor night will
[43:03] be called neither a dismay but a dismay
[43:07] but in the evening time it shall be what
[43:10] light you see that Rise and Shine for
[43:13] the light have come is that right we
[43:16] come in this hour he said it's not just
[43:18] darkness but it's gross Darkness that's
[43:21] on the people and we got the answer for
[43:24] the Devils what he's putting on the
[43:25] people people is that right we are the
[43:28] ones that now have to move forward and
[43:30] let them know that Jesus Christ is the
[43:33] same yesterday today and forever because
[43:38] his word cannot fail is that right so
[43:41] we're talking about now is that God is
[43:44] saying prove me is that right huh in the
[43:48] storehouse uh let's look at the
[43:50] storehouse this Storehouse is wide open
[43:53] I won't be able to get into all this on
[43:55] a Wednesday night night maybe the pastor
[43:57] or one of these ministering Brothers to
[43:59] pick it up some just look at the
[44:01] storehouse but it was working with that
[44:03] daily bread when the lord gave you that
[44:05] Daily Bread the storehouse just kept
[44:08] touching me and touching me and touching
[44:10] my spirit so we want you to look at this
[44:14] here A Storehouse we're turning around
[44:18] first let's look at Webster Webster say
[44:20] it's a building for storing goods and
[44:24] abundant supplies is that right
[44:28] uhoh come on there's only one Storehouse
[44:31] right now is that right let me keep
[44:34] going he said now let's look at the
[44:36] Hebrew definition of it he says it's a
[44:39] house it's a home of what of
[44:43] royalty uh-huh it's a
[44:46] palace of
[44:48] deity huh it's the it's a temple is that
[44:53] right so we're talking about now so he
[44:56] not saying you just a d we are the what
[45:00] the temple of God is that right and
[45:03] inside of us God planted a seed when
[45:06] before the foundation of the world is
[45:08] that right so this Temple though
[45:11] consists of three portions is that right
[45:14] Body Spirit and soul is that right so we
[45:18] know the seed takes fi smell and here
[45:21] was given to us just to contact the
[45:23] Earthly thing is that right
[45:26] and so many people get thrown off when
[45:29] they get to the spiritual realm is that
[45:32] right they sitting up there and with the
[45:34] religious demons is that right but we
[45:37] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[45:39] against principalities and powers in
[45:42] wickedness in rulers in high places is
[45:45] that right but God did what he's given
[45:47] us the word to do what cast down every
[45:50] demon cast down every imagination and
[45:54] try to exalt itself against the word of
[45:56] God so so many Believers get thrown off
[46:00] or believe that they're there because
[46:02] they still move to the spiritual real
[46:04] the imagination memory reasoning
[46:07] conscience and affection is that right
[46:10] but you're not there yet is that right
[46:13] come on now we still moveing three
[46:15] stages of Grace uh but down inside God's
[46:18] giv us a what a soul is that right and
[46:22] down in that soul is either Faith or is
[46:25] either death out but we got the faith
[46:27] seed the Abraham seed the Royal seed
[46:31] that God put it
[46:33] there
[46:35] Hallelujah we getting somewhere God help
[46:38] us we're talking about when God sent us
[46:41] out on a mission we're talking about the
[46:44] storehouse the storehouse is the word of
[46:47] God and when you go in that Storehouse
[46:50] you go into the word everything you need
[46:53] is where at in the word is that right in
[46:56] the beginning was the word the Word was
[46:59] God the word was with God and the Word
[47:02] was what made F flesh and it dwelt among
[47:06] us is that right we're going to get
[47:08] somewhere you just bear with us we got a
[47:10] lot of reading but that's okay it's the
[47:13] end of the year is that right you come
[47:15] to hear the word you didn't come to hear
[47:17] me is that right you want to hear from
[47:19] Christ we want to get into the word so
[47:21] we can grow that's why he said he said
[47:24] prove me now it's time to come on up
[47:27] hither is that right we about to come
[47:29] out of here Saints it should be no
[47:31] sickness it's power in the Church of God
[47:35] God gave us power and authority in his
[47:39] church is that right is what you speak
[47:42] if something if the devil come at you
[47:44] the prophet of God said it's your
[47:47] attitude how you receive it when the
[47:49] devil come at you you know what I Know
[47:52] The Enemy tried to come at this flesh
[47:54] here but you know what I wasn't claiming
[47:56] nothing is that right because the Bible
[47:59] say in the storehouse with his stripes
[48:02] I'm already healed is that right come on
[48:05] Saints we're claiming nothing we're
[48:08] moving into a new year Saints

[1:40:38] knows where the storehouse of God is is
[1:40:42] that right when the devil came at Jesus
[1:40:45] is that right not because Matthew 4 he
[1:40:48] said for what he came at him what Pastor
[1:40:51] cuz he was hungry is that right he knew
[1:40:55] the pattern he knew the pattern of the
[1:40:57] flesh he said because if thou be the
[1:41:00] Christ what turn these Stones unto what
[1:41:04] bread is that right Jesus went I tell
[1:41:06] you what turn to Luke for hallelujah

[1:41:27] that what it said was it Luke no I'm
[1:41:28] sorry Luke 4 I think I got the other
[1:41:31] Luke 4 thank you Jesus look what he says
[1:41:36] he's going in the
[1:41:37] storehouse we're talking about the
[1:41:40] storehouse he says now look we know when
[1:41:43] the and Jesus being full of the what
[1:41:46] Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and was
[1:41:48] led by the spirit Into the Wilderness
[1:41:51] see you got to be led there by the
[1:41:53] spirit that's why you just can't speak
[1:41:55] the word you could speak it yeah it be
[1:41:57] you speaking it ain't the Holy Spirit
[1:41:59] speaking through you speaking it huh
[1:42:01] that's why it don't come to pass and
[1:42:03] then you got around that's why he said
[1:42:05] when understanding come understanding is
[1:42:07] what the Lord taught us is revelation
[1:42:09] when the Revelation come where there's
[1:42:11] no vision the people what perish where
[1:42:13] there's no Revelation the people what
[1:42:15] perish is that right look what he says
[1:42:18] he went into the storehouse he said
[1:42:20] being 40 days tempted of the devil and
[1:42:22] in those days he did what he did eating
[1:42:26] nothing and when they had entered he he
[1:42:29] afterward was what hry hungry see he
[1:42:32] said now the devil said unto him if thou
[1:42:35] be the what Son of God can can command
[1:42:38] these stones that it be made what bread
[1:42:41] is that right he says and Jesus answered
[1:42:44] him saying it is what written that man
[1:42:47] should not live by what bread and long
[1:42:50] but by what every word of God is that
[1:42:54] right and we know that I want to just
[1:42:56] show you went into the storehouse is
[1:42:58] that right but to go to the storehouse
[1:43:00] we know now that Storehouse is being we
[1:43:03] at in Christ but one more scripture come
[1:43:05] to me go to Ephesians he went to the
[1:43:08] word he went to the storehouse is that
[1:43:11] right you got to understand in this hour
[1:43:14] here and now Ephesians is parallel to
[1:43:16] Joshua is that right Ephesians let's
[1:43:19] look at six cut it short here Ephesians
[1:43:22] 6 once you say Amen when you got it he
[1:43:26] said now look Ephesians 6 and 4 now this
[1:43:29] is what the prophet of God was working
[1:43:30] with he was trying to show them and
[1:43:32] bring them in this end time is that
[1:43:35] right you had to store up because
[1:43:37] remember he had a dream and in that
[1:43:39] dream then he didn't understand it at
[1:43:42] first he said in that dream he started
[1:43:44] packing lettuce and and cauliflower and
[1:43:47] all those things in the dream he was
[1:43:49] telling you had to store up he had to
[1:43:51] store up in the storehouse but he was
[1:43:54] telling them in that dream that you know
[1:43:56] he had to go he said but they go that he
[1:43:59] said but the boat that he had to go in
[1:44:01] he said but they love you so they'll get
[1:44:03] in a little what canoe is that right and
[1:44:06] they'll die right because he had not got
[1:44:08] that from the seals yet he had not given
[1:44:11] yet so he had a dream is that right and
[1:44:13] when he got in there this is the
[1:44:15] scripture that he used he said then
[1:44:17] after he came back I'm going to read it
[1:44:19] in a minute help me Lord he said there
[1:44:21] when he came there he was showing him in
[1:44:24] that dream there what he was really
[1:44:26] showing him that he had to store up the
[1:44:29] word and the only Storehouse is was the
[1:44:32] only Storehouse in America was there at
[1:44:35] the time except for their Brethren
[1:44:38] that's why some of you misinterpret it
[1:44:41] is because we won't do certain things we
[1:44:43] won't go certain places it's not that
[1:44:45] we're against the brethren we pray for
[1:44:48] the brethren we always go there and well
[1:44:50] in in in Fellowship but you got to
[1:44:53] understand we wrestle not against flesh
[1:44:55] and blood but it's principalities and
[1:44:58] powers and wickedness and rulers in all
[1:45:00] places so he was telling them in that
[1:45:03] dream that you was going to have to put
[1:45:05] on the whole armor of God
