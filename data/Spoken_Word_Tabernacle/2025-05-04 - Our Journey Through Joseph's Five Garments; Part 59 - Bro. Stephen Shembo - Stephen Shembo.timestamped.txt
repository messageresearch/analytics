[7:59] [Music]
[8:03] Lord. You are my
[8:10] Lord. Lord God, we thank you father.
[8:14] We thank you, Lord, for your presence
[8:17] this morning, Lord
[8:19] Jesus. We thank you for your spirit,
[8:23] Lord. We thank you for the power that
[8:25] you've had in our lives, Lord God. So
[8:29] many stories in this room, Lord, of how
[8:30] you've changed lives, Lord God, by the
[8:34] power and the strength of your word,
[8:36] Lord God, in this time.
[8:39] Lord, we're here for another portion.
[8:42] Lord, that you can further the work in
[8:44] us, Lord
[8:46] God. We want you to finish the work,
[8:48] Lord. You said you would, Lord. You
[8:50] wouldn't leave us uncomplete, Lord
[8:53] God. So, we want to lay before your feet
[8:56] this morning, Lord God, in a humility,
[8:58] Lord, and just ask that you feed us this
[9:00] morning, Lord God. Feed us of that
[9:03] precious word, Lord God.
[9:06] For we know that you are your word, Lord
[9:09] Jesus. Give us this day, Lord, our
[9:13] bread.
[9:14] Lord, we thank you,
[9:17] Father. How grateful are we, Lord God,
[9:20] for what you do for us,
[9:22] Lord. We can't sing a song strong enough
[9:25] to express ourselves, Lord, because
[9:27] there's no
[9:28] words, especially in this time
[9:32] of the end. Lord, I don't think there's
[9:36] even been a song written, Lord, that
[9:37] could
[9:38] express how we feel about the revelation
[9:41] of the word in this end time, Lord, and
[9:44] what you're showing us,
[9:45] Lord, that we are gods, Lord, as sons
[9:49] and daughters, we are
[9:52] gods. We want to give this service to
[9:54] you this morning, Lord Jesus, with
[9:56] everything that's in our bodies, Lord,
[9:58] our heart, our mind, our strength. We
[10:01] just want to place it all before you,
[10:03] [Music]
[10:04] Lord. Lord, bless our musicians this
[10:07] morning, Lord, and our
[10:09] singers. Bless our technicians, Lord,
[10:12] are very diligent, Lord, about making
[10:14] sure the service is just right,
[10:17] Lord. We thank you, Father, as we stand
[10:20] before the precious purchase of the
[10:22] blood of this congregation.
[10:25] Lord, we just ask that you would have
[10:28] your will once again, Lord, and bless
[10:30] this
[10:31] people. Go to that little front room
[10:33] once again, Lord. Bless our pastor,
[10:37] Lord, and let him bring forth the meal
[10:39] that you've prepared for us with him,
[10:41] Lord. Let nothing hinder it, Lord. Let
[10:45] every evil spirit that might try to
[10:46] hinder just go ahead and get up and
[10:48] leave, Lord, that you may have your
[10:51] perfect will in this house this morning.
[10:54] Bless those who might not have been able
[10:55] to make it, Lord, if they stay home and
[10:58] stream or if they're streaming from
[10:59] another country. Bless them, Lord. May
[11:02] the anointing
[11:03] overflow. And may you give travel mercy
[11:05] to those that are in route still,
[11:08] Lord. You know, you said you wouldn't
[11:11] lose a one, Lord, and that includes this
[11:14] morning's service. So, we thank you,
[11:17] Father. Bless the songs, bless
[11:20] everything, Lord. Bless the preaching.
[11:22] We don't want to be here in vain, Lord.
[11:24] For without you, it would be
[11:27] vanity. Have your will, Lord. We thank
[11:30] you. Give you all glory, honor, and
[11:32] praise in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And
[11:35] amen. Let's give him a big clap offering
[11:38] this morning. What a mighty God we
[11:41] serve. Amen. Turn around and greet your
[11:44] neighbor and say, "Welcome to the house
[11:46] of the Lord.

[27:15] this weekend for their tent meeting and
[27:17] I was planning on coming home last night
[27:20] after the service and the service ended
[27:22] around 11:00 p.m. and I was going to be
[27:25] on my way home, but then my phone was
[27:27] dying and I wasn't worried about it um
[27:30] cuz I I said I'm just going to go to a
[27:32] gas station, get a charger and charge it
[27:34] on my way home. But I had I went to
[27:36] three different gas stations to find
[27:38] trying to get a charger and none of them
[27:40] would work. Um because my phone was
[27:42] saying that there was water in the port
[27:45] and I know that there was not water in
[27:46] the port. So I was like I don't know
[27:48] what's happening. I tried so many
[27:50] different ways. I was blowing into it. I
[27:52] was um one of the workers at the gas
[27:55] station gave me some canned air to blow
[27:57] into the port to see if I can get the
[27:59] water out and nothing was working. Um I
[28:03] was sitting in the gas station. I was
[28:04] like, I have two choices. I can either
[28:06] sit here and wait until my phone starts
[28:09] uh charging or I can just get on the
[28:12] highway and go home. And I was 2 and a
[28:15] half hours away from home and I was
[28:17] like, I'm just going to get on the
[28:18] highway and find my way home. So, I got
[28:21] I say I'll just drive until I see one of
[28:23] the road signs here says Charlotte,
[28:25] North Carolina, and I'm just going to
[28:26] go. I was like, phone or not, I'm not
[28:28] staying here. So, I got on the road and
[28:31] praise the Lord, I'm here. And the road
[28:34] was very hard. It was raining and foggy,
[28:36] but I made it here.
[28:38] [Applause]
[28:41] Amen.
[28:43] Amen. Amen.
[28:47] GPS. Amen. Come on up, my brother. Let's
[28:51] stand as we go to the Lord this morning.
[28:52] If you have a if you have a a burden on
[28:55] your heart this morning, raise your hand
[28:57] to the Lord and let him know. I'm sure
[28:59] he knows already. Amen. God bless you.
[29:03] All right family, let us pray.
[29:06] Lord Jesus, we thank you, Father, Lord,
[29:08] for hearing testimonies, Lord God, that
[29:10] Lord, it proves, heavenly father, that
[29:12] without the electronic devices, Father,
[29:15] Lord, you still know how to guide your
[29:16] children, Father. Lord, you are the
[29:19] north star, Lord God. And with you
[29:20] reigning in our hearts, Lord God, you
[29:22] know how to lead and guide us, Lord God.
[29:24] For you are that everpresent compass,
[29:25] Lord Jesus.
[29:27] Father, we thank you, Lord, for another
[29:29] opportunity, Lord God, to rejoice with
[29:31] one another, Lord, to praise your name,
[29:32] Lord God, and to hear your word of
[29:34] instruction, Lord, your word of
[29:35] correction. Your word that's going to
[29:37] take us, Lord, another step higher, Lord
[29:39] God. We give you thanks for it, Lord
[29:40] God. For there's many, Lord God, that do
[29:42] not have this opportunity, Lord God,
[29:44] because they're blinded, Lord God. So,
[29:45] we give you thanks for it, Lord God. We
[29:47] don't ever want to become complacent,
[29:49] Lord God, and just be another service,
[29:51] Lord God, where we can shout and praise,
[29:53] Father, but the master speaking, Lord
[29:55] God. And that's the most important thing
[29:57] is to cleave unto every word, Lord God,
[29:59] for your prophet said, "Stay with the
[30:01] word." Father, we thank you, Lord God.
[30:04] Father, we have requests, Lord God, that
[30:06] you know all about, Father. But I
[30:07] believe if we all pray on one accord,
[30:09] Lord God, that the healing of our
[30:11] brother's knee, Lord God, and the
[30:13] headache demon, Father, Lord, that I'm
[30:15] having a battle with as well, Lord God.
[30:17] I know, Father, that you're able, Lord
[30:18] God. And the sister, Lord God, that has
[30:21] the cancer on the breast, Father, Lord,
[30:22] you came in a cancer age, Lord God, to
[30:24] prove, heavenly Father, that there's no
[30:26] demon, there's no devil, Lord God,
[30:28] there's no thought that can be
[30:29] expressed, Lord, above your thought,
[30:31] Lord God, and by your preeminence, Lord
[30:34] God. Lord, we know, Father, that you can
[30:35] bring everything under subjection, Lord,
[30:37] to your power, Lord God. And Father, we
[30:39] ask these things, Father, because you
[30:41] promised in this hour here, Lord, that
[30:42] you would prove, heavenly Father, that
[30:44] the impossible is possible, Lord God.
[30:47] So, Lord, we believe that you can take
[30:48] away the cancer, Lord God. Lord, I
[30:50] believe you can restore the breast, Lord
[30:52] God, because your prophet said that
[30:53] there will come a time, Lord God, where
[30:55] limbs will be restored, Lord God. And if
[30:57] this is not the time Lord God, then when
[30:59] Lord Jesus, Father, we pray, Lord God,
[31:01] for the remainder of the service, Lord
[31:03] God, that you bless the tithes and the
[31:04] offerings for the furtherance of your
[31:06] kingdom, Lord. Father, we pray, Lord
[31:08] Jesus Christ, for the addition, Lord,
[31:10] that we are endeavoring in, Lord God,
[31:12] that you continue to bless, Lord, the
[31:13] hands that are preparing it, Lord God.
[31:15] Keep them from sickness, Lord. Keep them
[31:17] from distractions, Lord God. And keep
[31:19] the progression moving forward, Lord
[31:20] God. We believe, Lord, that you're able,
[31:22] Lord, to do a supernatural work, Lord
[31:24] God, with the things we commit unto
[31:25] thee, Lord God. Father, we pray Lord God
[31:27] for the pastor Lord God and just that
[31:29] you keep everything Lord God and the
[31:30] subjection Lord to your perfect will in
[31:33] Jesus Christ's precious name we pray.
[31:35] Amen.
[31:43] Amen. Brother Ben, we're just going to
[31:46] call you up to sing, my brother. You
[31:48] ready? Okay. Don't be going nowhere.

[53:51] glory to God. I told sister Cheron again
[53:53] this morning. I say you look
[53:56] beautiful. With those colors sparkling,
[53:59] I said I say this is for me. Really?
[54:02] Okay, don't worry. We'll take about it
[54:04] in a couple's meeting. But at least
[54:09] have I said something wrong. Okay.
[54:11] Praise be to the name of the Lord. I
[54:13] believe you are all up to date with the
[54:16] sermon. We're reading our Bible twice a
[54:18] day. Our cood book church ages 70 weeks
[54:22] of Daniel the seals adoption or sabbandi
[54:26] is listening to the message of the hour.
[54:28] Amen. Sister Sharon hand up to be
[54:31] fortunate to be my wife. So if you have
[54:34] a problem hearing her name on the pulpit
[54:36] that's your problem because me and her
[54:39] we are one.
[54:43] So you can't talk about me without
[54:45] talking about her.
[54:50] So that was just a tommo missile that
[54:53] was flying somewhere. Amen. To just make
[54:57] sure we quieten the atmosphere. Amen.
[55:00] The question and answer. I'm still
[55:02] waiting on the deacon for our next
[55:03] quarterly meeting. And Lord's willing,
[55:05] our married couple part six will be on
[55:08] May 10th, which is going to be next uh
[55:11] Saturday. And if you got a guest and
[55:13] they want to come, just let us know
[55:15] ahead of time so we make sure we give
[55:16] them a a warm welcome and uh uh make
[55:20] sure they're comfortable and they don't
[55:22] feel like they knew or the visitors or
[55:24] something like that. And if there is any
[55:26] question, just do the best if you can
[55:28] put it by Wednesday. So I make sure as
[55:30] I'm going through the series and we will
[55:32] go ahead. I will see what I will do by
[55:34] the grace of God. My purpose is to get
[55:36] in birth control and start it from the
[55:38] scripture and lay it down completely so
[55:41] we can see what does the prophet say
[55:43] because we got too uh uh sad in the
[55:46] message. One say no, one say yes. We
[55:49] need to put it together and then find
[55:51] out what does not what a preacher say.
[55:54] What does the Bible and the message of
[55:56] the hour say? What does the prophet say?
[55:59] Enough with what preacher says or
[56:01] preacher so we want to hear the word.
[56:04] the word and nothing but the word. Amen.
[56:08] And then on June the 7th which will be
[56:11] the youngsman meeting and we will pick
[56:13] up right there and start on courtship. I
[56:16] believe I got everything clear. Brother
[56:17] Robert, brother Tony, brother Glenn, we
[56:20] got a baby dedication this morning.
[56:25] The baby was born, but the doctor asked
[56:27] for the baby to stay a little bit longer
[56:28] at home because of allergies and
[56:30] everything. But by the grace of God, now
[56:32] he's free to come to service. And now
[56:35] the baby's here this morning. It's uh uh
[56:38] the son of brother patient and sister
[56:40] Isabella. So it has been a while since
[56:43] you've seen sister Isabella. Now she's
[56:45] here this morning and the baby name is
[56:47] William.
[56:50] [Applause]
[56:55] So the musician are not here. I forgot
[56:57] about it. So you all the congregation
[56:59] will sing bring them in as they coming
[57:03] in. So let's go. Bring them
[57:06] in. Bring them
[57:10] in. Bring them in from
[57:16] the
[57:19] Br. Bring them in.
[57:23] Bring the little one to
[57:28] Jesus. Brother Patient and sister
[57:30] Isabella, you can turn so the
[57:32] congregation can see you. They look
[57:34] good.
[57:35] Beautiful. A little bit
[57:38] closer. A little bit.
[57:42] Ah, that's the way we want it. It looks
[57:45] like he want to renew the marriage vow
[57:47] again because you look so great. Let me
[57:50] read something in the scripture. And
[57:52] according to the message of the hour, so
[57:54] we we we you you have an anchorage.
[57:58] According to the book of Luke 18 verse1
[58:01] 15, the Bible says, "And they brought
[58:03] unto him also what?" You got one right
[58:06] there. That he would touch them. But
[58:09] when his disciples saw it, they rebuked
[58:12] them. But Jesus called them unto him and
[58:15] say, "Suffer little children to come
[58:18] unto me and forbid them not for of such
[58:22] is the kingdom of God." Amen. And
[58:26] brother Brown, I mean the message, the
[58:27] token after the opening of the seal, he
[58:30] says, "You know, when I see little
[58:32] fellows like that, he always take me
[58:35] back when I was a little boy. And now
[58:37] the old saying is you know they on
[58:41] your feet now and your heart later. I
[58:44] don't believe in that curse. Brother
[58:47] Brandham say but I don't believe it.
[58:50] It shall be so when we dedicate them to
[58:54] the Lord.
[58:56] How many believe in dedication of
[58:58] babies?
[59:00] So a dedication is a protection. It's a
[59:04] covering. You are taking the baby back
[59:07] to the original owner. You taking the
[59:10] baby and telling God, "This is your
[59:11] baby. We appreciate your gift, but we
[59:14] know that we cannot control what is
[59:16] going on in this life. He only take the
[59:19] supervision of the Holy Spirit to make
[59:21] sure they keep the baby in line with the
[59:24] word." Brother Brandham say, "I don't
[59:26] believe it shall be so when we dedicate
[59:28] them to the Lord." We have a
[59:30] responsibility here and God placed this
[59:33] in your hand. He made a preacher out of
[59:37] you. He made a preacher out of you. I

[59:56] internet working. And you got a
[59:59] responsibility. God bless you both. You
[1:00:02] got a fine little family. Amen. This is
[1:00:07] not the only baby I'm dedicating. There
[1:00:10] is more to come.

[1:00:46] again, baby
[1:00:48] William. Man, I don't want my wife to

[1:00:58] wonderful. Praise
[1:01:00] God. You okay, buddy? Okay, let's go
[1:01:04] ahead and you pray with me. Heavenly
[1:01:07] Father, Lord, we are approaching you
[1:01:09] humbly again. Father this morning
[1:01:12] thanking you for your grace, your love,
[1:01:14] your mercy that have provided such a
[1:01:17] wonderful bundle of love. A gift that is
[1:01:20] coming from thee Lord to bless this
[1:01:22] family and bless the church. Lord, as
[1:01:24] you spoke to us through your word, you
[1:01:26] gave it to us and now we are bringing
[1:01:29] baby William Bbe onto the hand, Lord.
[1:01:32] Father, we pray that the angel that was
[1:01:34] ordained to oversee this baby be always
[1:01:37] there, Lord. Father, may your blood
[1:01:40] protect him because these are seed that
[1:01:42] have come in the end time when the world
[1:01:44] is completely in turmoil, Lord. But
[1:01:47] Father, we believe there is a purpose
[1:01:48] for this child to be born in such a
[1:01:51] time, Lord. Father, may you bless him
[1:01:53] and bless not only him, but bless mama
[1:01:56] and daddy, Lord. Father, grant unto them
[1:01:58] the wisdom they need, Lord. Father, to
[1:02:00] raise this child in the fear and
[1:02:02] admonition of the Lord. Father, we
[1:02:05] rebuke every spirit of sickness, any
[1:02:07] attack from the world of darkness,
[1:02:09] anything that the devil will try to
[1:02:12] sabotage this gift. Lord, let that this
[1:02:14] gift stand as a testimony to declare
[1:02:17] again, Lord, Father, that you are still
[1:02:19] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:02:22] Lord, bless him and give him a good
[1:02:24] health. We commit him unto their hand
[1:02:27] and bless this family in the name of
[1:02:29] Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. God richly
[1:02:33] bless you.
[1:02:34] Congratulation. All right, baby. It's so
[1:02:37] quiet. Praise
[1:02:39] God. Congratulation again. God bless
[1:02:42] you. Let's give the Lord a big clap
[1:02:52] offering. The last time I baptized,
[1:02:55] brother Robert told me that I was a
[1:02:57] professional already. So now I don't
[1:02:59] know about baby dedication where I am at
[1:03:01] in a mast's or PhD. I'm not sure yet.
[1:03:04] Oh, somebody say PhD. Oh, praise be to
[1:03:07] the name of the Lord. Brother Glenn, I
[1:03:09] believe we got everything covered. So, I
[1:03:11] will try the best if you do good today,
[1:03:14] the next time, then next Wednesday, the
[1:03:17] next Sunday, we will get where we
[1:03:19] supposed to be doing. Okay. Yeah. There
[1:03:21] was something popping up in the night. I
[1:03:24] keep pushing. I say somebody will try to
[1:03:25] pull again today. So, we need to rush
[1:03:28] like leave me on the highway so we can
[1:03:30] move on forward. Amen.
[1:03:32] Glory to God. So let's stand now for the
[1:03:34] reading of the word. My subject this
[1:03:38] morning is our life journey through
[1:03:40] Joseph's five garment part 59.
[1:03:46] Praise God. Amen.
[1:03:50] My theme this morning is a
[1:03:53] multi-purpose life.
[1:03:57] Is the word difficult?
[1:04:00] Okay. A
[1:04:03] multi a
[1:04:05] multi-
[1:04:08] purpose
[1:04:12] life. In other word, it's a life that
[1:04:15] doesn't have only one purpose.
[1:04:18] It's a life that have several many
[1:04:21] purposes. Amen. A multi-purpose life.
[1:04:25] Because when we say purpose, we always
[1:04:27] look at one thing
[1:04:30] and now we want to broaden that. Now
[1:04:34] it's a bundle of purposes
[1:04:37] put together into one purpose. Amen.
[1:04:41] It's not just about Joseph ruling. It's
[1:04:43] Joseph ruling, Joseph interpreting
[1:04:46] dream, Joseph saving people from Canaan
[1:04:49] all over the land. And Joseph also
[1:04:52] displaying Jesus Christ.
[1:04:55] So there is more to Joseph than just
[1:04:58] Joseph. We clear on that one. So flight
[1:05:01] attendant prepare for takeoff. Heavenly
[1:05:04] Father, Lord, we approaching you humbly
[1:05:06] this morning. Father, we thank you for
[1:05:09] your grace. You of your mercy and for
[1:05:11] healing baby William, Lord. And to see
[1:05:13] him healthy and looking good. It is
[1:05:16] nothing but an expression of love from
[1:05:18] thee. Lord, we have done the best that
[1:05:20] we can do with the ability you have
[1:05:22] given us. But when it comes to
[1:05:24] ministering your word, Lord, to speak to
[1:05:27] your children and interpreted, he only
[1:05:29] take the supernatural action of the Holy
[1:05:31] Spirit. Father, may you move me
[1:05:34] completely out of the way. May you move
[1:05:36] the audience, both visible and
[1:05:38] invisible, out of the way. May you be
[1:05:40] the one speaking, the one interpreting,
[1:05:42] the one filling, blessing, healing, and
[1:05:44] the one doing everything because we
[1:05:46] depend upon thee. We commit everything
[1:05:48] be the alpha and the omega. the
[1:05:51] beginning and the ending of this service
[1:05:53] in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[1:05:57] Let's go to Jeremiah
[1:06:01] 29. Glory to God.
[1:06:09] Everybody slept good.
[1:06:12] Okay. Praise God. I slept late. Woke up
[1:06:15] early for some reason and start praying.
[1:06:18] So God knows there's a purpose for that.
[1:06:24] Jeremiah 29, this is where we have been
[1:06:27] there. You know what it is, right? We
[1:06:30] clear. Glory to God. Let's go to verse
[1:06:34] one. I will skip certain verses and
[1:06:37] those that I'm going to skip down the
[1:06:39] road, we will pick them up because if I
[1:06:42] touch them now, we gone. I'm not going
[1:06:45] to touch anything. So let's see if we do
[1:06:48] good. So what I skipped today, we pick
[1:06:51] it up next Sunday and we see because
[1:06:53] there are many stuff laying here. Now
[1:06:56] according to verse one, the Bible says
[1:06:58] that
[1:06:59] now these are the words of the letter
[1:07:03] that Jeremiah the prophet sent from
[1:07:06] Jerusalem to the residue or the rest of
[1:07:10] the elders which were carried away
[1:07:13] captive and to the priest and to the
[1:07:15] prophet and to all the people whom
[1:07:18] Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive
[1:07:21] from Jerusalem to Babylon. You may be
[1:07:24] seated. So clearly here we find out that
[1:07:27] Jeremiah stayed in Jerusalem. He did not
[1:07:32] go to captivity. Are we clear? So there
[1:07:35] was a residue. There was a a certain
[1:07:38] group of people that were taken captive
[1:07:40] by Nebuchadnezzar all the way to
[1:07:42] Babylon. Now Jeremiah sent them a
[1:07:45] letter, a letter of a prophecy of what
[1:07:49] God is trying to say to those people
[1:07:51] that are there. Because over there they
[1:07:54] got priesthood, they got prophet and
[1:07:56] things were happening there. And
[1:07:57] Jeremiah already prophesied that it's
[1:07:59] going to take how many years? 70 years.
[1:08:01] 70 years. But he sent them a letter. We
[1:08:04] clear? Job to verse
[1:08:06] four. In verse four, the Bible says,
[1:08:10] "Thus says the Lord of host, the God of
[1:08:13] Israel, to all that are carried away
[1:08:17] captive." We clear? Amen. Come on. whom
[1:08:22] I have
[1:08:24] caused to be carry away to be carried
[1:08:28] away from Jerusalem to Babylon. So who
[1:08:33] caused that carrying away?
[1:08:37] Who initiated it? God caused it. We
[1:08:42] clear? So if God calls
[1:08:45] something, ask God before you move.
[1:08:50] Amen. God is the one that moved them and
[1:08:53] put them there and God say you will stay
[1:08:56] there for 70 years.
[1:09:00] Then preacher priest begin to come up
[1:09:03] and begin to pray. They say no no no no
[1:09:05] you're going to go early.
[1:09:08] Wow. We clear verse eight. This is why
[1:09:12] God is sending this letter. I will I
[1:09:14] have skipped uh verse 56. will pick it
[1:09:17] up. Verse 8, he says, "For thus sayith
[1:09:20] the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel,
[1:09:24] let not your prophets,"
[1:09:26] we understand now, "
[1:09:32] you deceive you."
[1:09:34] Neither hearken to your dream, which you
[1:09:37] cause to be dream. You so much under
[1:09:40] pressure, you think about something all
[1:09:43] day. Guess what? You going to dream
[1:09:46] about it? I have a question and answer
[1:09:49] about a dream for my like two years. The
[1:09:51] Lord doesn't give me a chance to get
[1:09:53] there. But we will get and you will
[1:09:54] understand how dreams operate. Are we
[1:09:57] together? Are we together? The Bible
[1:10:00] says verse n for they prophesy falsely
[1:10:04] to you in my name. I have not sent them
[1:10:08] say the Lord. For thus says the Lord,
[1:10:11] that after, not before, my friend. In
[1:10:15] other word, any prophecy
[1:10:19] that is contrary, any dream that is
[1:10:23] contrary to the prophecy of Jeremiah
[1:10:26] doesn't come from God.
[1:10:30] That's right.
[1:10:31] That's why Paul say if any one of you
[1:10:34] think you're spiritual remember that
[1:10:36] word I'm saying it's a commandment from
[1:10:39] the Lord
[1:10:43] it's a letter that was sent right it was
[1:10:46] written in a letter
[1:10:49] in tracks
[1:10:51] and it was sent in tracks whatever is
[1:10:54] contrary to the tracks come on of the
[1:10:57] prophet God didn't Amen.
[1:11:00] Are we clear? Easy. Praise God. He says,
[1:11:05] "For after 70 years be accomplished at
[1:11:09] Babylon," we on verse 10, brother uh
[1:11:12] Benjamin, "I will visit you and perform
[1:11:17] my good words toward you in causing you
[1:11:20] to return to this water." Are we clear?
[1:11:24] Amen. So go ahead and start fasting
[1:11:27] before 70 years.
[1:11:33] You will see a kidney doctor, my friend.
[1:11:37] Amen.
[1:11:40] Relax in your life. Don't stress up your
[1:11:42] life. Okay? It's not how much you doing
[1:11:46] the work. Relax, my friend. All is well.
[1:11:49] Are we together? Amen. For I know
[1:11:54] They thought that I think toward you.
[1:11:57] How can you tell somebody in captivity I
[1:11:59] know? I'm already suffering and you
[1:12:02] telling me I know. And you are telling
[1:12:05] me I have to wait 70 years. Then you
[1:12:07] come, you say I know. So what am I doing
[1:12:09] right here? The 70 years was to give the
[1:12:13] land remember rest. Because they abuse
[1:12:18] the land. They overwork the land. Yes,
[1:12:21] they were working till Sunday.
[1:12:25] Don't worry about it. Okay, they were
[1:12:27] working till sun. They overwork the land
[1:12:30] until God say, "Uh-uh, I need the land
[1:12:33] to recover 70 years." So when you go
[1:12:37] back, the land will be so fresh,
[1:12:40] full of stuff for 70 years.
[1:12:45] Amen. Because if God sent you before,
[1:12:47] the land is not recovering yet.
[1:12:51] By you praying, you say you want to go
[1:12:52] there. God where? In an in an abused
[1:12:55] land.
[1:12:58] Verse 11. For I know the thoughts that I
[1:13:02] think toward you, says the Lord.
[1:13:05] Thoughts of what? Peace. You know that
[1:13:07] what it means now, right? And note of
[1:13:10] what? Evil. To give you an expected end.
[1:13:14] We clear on that one. So the thinking,
[1:13:16] the plans of God was good. Yes. Even
[1:13:20] taking them to Babylon. Amen.
[1:13:25] He was good.
[1:13:27] He had a purpose. Are we together? God
[1:13:31] say, "Stay there. I know what I'm
[1:13:33] doing."
[1:13:34] After 70 years, you don't have to worry
[1:13:37] about it. I'm I am the one who carry you
[1:13:39] away.
[1:13:41] After 70 years, the same way I took you
[1:13:43] away, I'm coming to pick you up.
[1:13:48] No problem. my friend. Verse 12, then
[1:13:51] shall you call upon me.
[1:13:54] You see, when you start calling upon
[1:13:56] him,
[1:13:58] sir, you can call before, but if you
[1:14:02] call before, just know you're staying
[1:14:04] right there. You have to pray a
[1:14:06] different prayer before 70 years. I will
[1:14:09] show you that next Sunday. If you do
[1:14:11] good today,
[1:14:13] you cannot pray to leave. No, sir. You
[1:14:16] have to pray a different prayer. Amen.
[1:14:20] Because the purpose is dictating the the
[1:14:23] the answer of prayers.
[1:14:26] Are we okay? He said then shall you call
[1:14:30] upon me and you shall go and do what?
[1:14:33] Pray unto me and I will do what? Hearken
[1:14:36] unto you. At that point when you pray I
[1:14:38] listen. Amen.
[1:14:41] Before if you pray to leavem
[1:14:45] Israel have to say 400. Right. Amen.
[1:14:48] It's not going to work my friend. If you
[1:14:51] don't understand these things, you will
[1:14:53] be a Pentecoster in this message and
[1:14:55] you're going to stretch your life for 10
[1:14:57] years. And after 10 years, everything is
[1:15:00] delivered and you already have a high
[1:15:02] blood pressure. Wow. Amen. Amen. And now
[1:15:06] you need to start praying to remove the
[1:15:07] high blood pressure. Because you didn't
[1:15:10] understand those element.
[1:15:13] Are we together?
[1:15:15] All right. Let's go to Matthew 13.
[1:15:18] You're doing good, my friend.
[1:15:23] This is not milk.
[1:15:26] Amen.
[1:15:28] Amen. Amen. Yeah. You ate long enough,
[1:15:32] then you can begin to get some stuff.
[1:15:38] Amen. You can begin to crack some bones.
[1:15:42] Amen. Amen. Amen. Matthew
[1:15:46] 13. If you think this is strange, wait
[1:15:48] for what is coming up.
[1:15:51] Matthew 13. If you dare, you can say
[1:15:53] amen. Amen. Verse
[1:15:56] 24. You there? Amen. All right. Another
[1:16:01] parable put he forth to them. We already
[1:16:04] prayed.
[1:16:06] Saying, the kingdom of heaven is like to
[1:16:10] a man which seweth water. good seed in
[1:16:14] his field. Okay, before I continue, we
[1:16:17] need to clarify this thing so it makes
[1:16:19] sense. If not, we will be moving without
[1:16:21] knowing how we going. Job to verse 37.
[1:16:24] Then we come back again.
[1:16:27] You there? Amen. He answered and said to
[1:16:30] them,
[1:16:33] he that sawth the good go to verse 36.
[1:16:37] Then Jesus sent the multitude away and
[1:16:40] went into the house and his disciple
[1:16:43] came to him saying, "Declare to us the
[1:16:45] parable of the tears of the field." If
[1:16:48] you read Matthew 13 from the beginning,
[1:16:51] Jesus spoke about other parables. That's
[1:16:53] right. But the disciple never asked
[1:16:56] about the other one. Only this one.
[1:16:59] That's right. We clear now? Verse 37. He
[1:17:02] answered and said to them, he that seth
[1:17:07] the good seed is who? The son of man. So
[1:17:10] the swer here, the swer is who? Son of
[1:17:14] man. The son of man.
[1:17:17] And who is the son of man?
[1:17:20] The one that was talking.
[1:17:23] It is Christ himself.
[1:17:26] We clear? Amen. So now when we read, we
[1:17:29] know who is the ser. We clear? Amen.
[1:17:31] Verse 38. The field is what? The world.
[1:17:35] We understand now. This world here is
[1:17:38] the field of the son of man. We clear.
[1:17:42] Come on. The good seed
[1:17:49] are the what? Children of the kingdom.
[1:17:53] But the tears are the children of what?
[1:17:55] The wicked one. So the good
[1:17:59] seed, the good seed here are people.
[1:18:04] [Applause]
[1:18:07] I told you about what was coming up.
[1:18:10] Okay, let me go your way. They are
[1:18:12] children.
[1:18:16] Children of who?
[1:18:20] Children of who? The kingdom. Kingdom of
[1:18:23] God.
[1:18:24] And the tears are who? Children of the
[1:18:27] wicked one. Children of the devil.
[1:18:35] So now we clear about the parable.
[1:18:37] Right? We all clear. Now let's go back
[1:18:40] to verse 24.
[1:18:43] Now another parable put he forth to them
[1:18:46] saying the kingdom of heaven is like
[1:18:49] unto a man. We know that man now. It is
[1:18:53] who? The son of man. A man which saw
[1:18:58] water good seed in his field. If you
[1:19:01] notice the seed is good.
[1:19:05] Amen.
[1:19:08] The seed is good.
[1:19:10] Are we clear? And we know that good
[1:19:15] in the Bible means what?
[1:19:21] You you have a problem with that? No.
[1:19:23] You know the rich young ruler, right?
[1:19:25] Good master. God said there is no one
[1:19:27] who is good but what?
[1:19:29] So good sir in the Bible is who? So this
[1:19:34] God seed
[1:19:38] [Applause]
[1:19:42] are we together? Amen. This God seed are
[1:19:46] the children of God.
[1:19:50] Are we together?
[1:19:52] Are we together? Let's make it a little
[1:19:55] bit harder.
[1:19:56] Go back up to verse
[1:20:01] three. Go to verse three of Matthew uh
[1:20:05] Matthew 13. If you there, you can say
[1:20:06] amen. Amen. The Bible say, "And he spoke
[1:20:09] many things to them in parable,
[1:20:12] saying, behold, a
[1:20:15] ser now, went forth to sow." We clear?
[1:20:19] Amen. And when he
[1:20:23] saw some seeds, if you notice, seeds is
[1:20:27] plural.
[1:20:31] Are we together? The seeds are plural.
[1:20:34] My God. The Bible say seeds,
[1:20:39] it's plural.
[1:20:41] Amen. Some
[1:20:43] seed fell by the wayside and the father
[1:20:48] and the fouls came and devoured them up.
[1:20:52] Are we together? Amen. Down the road we
[1:20:55] know that the seeds are the children of
[1:20:57] the kingdom. But here they are also
[1:21:00] seeds.
[1:21:04] We clear? And we need to know this seed
[1:21:07] here is who?
[1:21:09] Amen. We clear. Amen. If you turn, do
[1:21:13] not do it. I save you some time. If you
[1:21:16] turn into Luke 8 verse 5, Luke repeat
[1:21:21] the same parable. And Luke say a
[1:21:25] ser is went out to sow what? Seed. It is
[1:21:31] the seed of the swer. Amen. But the swer
[1:21:34] is the son of man. That's right. And if
[1:21:36] you notice here, Luke put seed singular.
[1:21:42] Are we together?
[1:21:44] Are we together? Uh he says some the
[1:21:49] seed that was singular becomes plural.
[1:21:52] He say his seed singular and as he swed.
[1:21:57] Wow. Amen. You understand? Amen. Some
[1:22:00] the seed now is multiply.
[1:22:03] Amen. Yes sir. Amen. So all the seed
[1:22:07] make one seed.
[1:22:10] Are we together? Are we together? He
[1:22:13] says some fell by the wayside and he was
[1:22:16] what? Down. And the fouls of the air did
[1:22:19] what? power. And when you drop to Luke
[1:22:23] 8:1, Jesus said that
[1:22:26] now the parable is this the seed is
[1:22:32] what? The word of God.
[1:22:37] Now the seed
[1:22:40] is what? The word of God.
[1:22:47] But the seed was what? children of God.
[1:22:51] And the seed is what? The word of God.
[1:22:53] And it's a good seed. It is a God seed.
[1:22:58] And a God seed is a person.
[1:23:01] And that person is also the word.
[1:23:06] Yes, sir.
[1:23:07] If I lost you, you raise your hand. My
[1:23:09] friend, let me start it again. My
[1:23:11] friend, according to Matthew 13, good
[1:23:16] deity seed are people. Amen.
[1:23:21] It's a children of God. A child of God
[1:23:24] is a good seed. It's a God seed.
[1:23:29] But a seed also is the word.
[1:23:33] So a child of God is a word.
[1:23:37] Yes, sir.
[1:23:40] Have I lost somebody? Okay. Praise God.
[1:23:44] Brother Robert, if you notice in first
[1:23:47] Peter 1 verse 23, the Bible say that
[1:23:50] when we are born again, you follow me?
[1:23:55] Being born again, not of what?
[1:23:57] Corruptible seed. But what?
[1:23:59] Incorruptible by what? The word of God,
[1:24:02] which does what? Liveth and abideth
[1:24:04] forever.
[1:24:06] So there is another word of God that
[1:24:09] liveth. Yes. Amen. And that word ab
[1:24:13] forever. It's a word that can talk.
[1:24:17] That's right. Amen. Amen. A word that
[1:24:20] doesn't
[1:24:21] die forever. And that word is
[1:24:25] incorruptible.
[1:24:27] And it's called the law go. That's
[1:24:29] exactly what it is. So when you are born
[1:24:32] again, Peter is saying that you are born
[1:24:36] again by the word of God that is coming
[1:24:39] toward you. Amen. But my question is you
[1:24:43] are already the word.
[1:24:47] So what is the new birth then?
[1:24:52] [Music]
[1:24:54] Have I lost somebody? So what is the new
[1:24:57] birth now? There is a pillar of fire who
[1:25:00] is the word of God that liveth forever.
[1:25:04] But you also you are the word of God.
[1:25:07] There is a word of God, Jesus Christ.
[1:25:10] And there is a word of God, Tony
[1:25:13] Thompson.
[1:25:16] [Applause]
[1:25:22] Is that hard? There is a word of God
[1:25:25] called Jesus Christ. But there is also a
[1:25:28] word of God.
[1:25:30] Yes, sir. That is called Christy.
[1:25:34] Amen. That's right, brother.
[1:25:37] And when you are born again, one come
[1:25:40] toward the other.
[1:25:44] Yes,
[1:25:46] brother. Glory. Glory. Glory. Are we
[1:25:49] together? Are we together?
[1:25:55] Glory to God. Brother Steph,
[1:26:00] these are two separate parable. How do
[1:26:02] you put them together? Because I got a
[1:26:04] prophet. Brother Brham says, "A swer
[1:26:07] went forth and did what?" Sow seed. And
[1:26:10] while he slept, another ser came by
[1:26:12] water. Sow tears. He went ahead and told
[1:26:15] the parable. The disciple could not
[1:26:17] understand it. Jesus did water. Explain
[1:26:19] to them. He said the ser is who? The son
[1:26:22] of man and the field is water the earth
[1:26:24] and the seed is the water word of God.
[1:26:27] Now brother Brandham put the two parable
[1:26:29] together. Brother Brandham say amen. The
[1:26:32] seed is water. The word of God. Whatever
[1:26:35] God's word say it is water. Seed. And
[1:26:38] you also you are a seed.
[1:26:41] But let's solve this problem once for
[1:26:43] all. Okay. Please keep your seat belt
[1:26:47] because I'm going to take off from the
[1:26:48] airport. Brother Brham says in the God
[1:26:51] who is rich in mercy. He says many of
[1:26:54] you can fellowship with me on water.
[1:26:57] Yes. In other words, many of you can
[1:26:59] find yourself in this same situation
[1:27:03] like brother Brham.
[1:27:06] What is that situation?
[1:27:10] The situation brother Brandham say when
[1:27:13] you was a little boy
[1:27:17] or a little water girl. So both of you
[1:27:20] are together. You would walk around and
[1:27:22] there will be certain things that would
[1:27:25] just where it would not bother the kids.
[1:27:32] Amen. I'm putting everything together.
[1:27:35] It seems like there was something where
[1:27:38] in you.
[1:27:41] That thing is where? In you.
[1:27:46] Amen.
[1:27:48] Hallelujah. When you were fighting with
[1:27:50] your friend, there was something in you.
[1:27:53] Yes, sir. When you were drinking
[1:27:55] alcohol, there was something in you.
[1:27:59] Where you were smoking
[1:28:03] marijuana? Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord.
[1:28:08] Yes, sir. There was something in you
[1:28:11] when you were watching that pornography.
[1:28:14] There was something in you that didn't
[1:28:17] like it.
[1:28:19] It is a good son.
[1:28:25] Are we together? Are we together? Are we
[1:28:29] together? He says there was something in
[1:28:32] you that did what? Cried out.
[1:28:36] Brother Brandham say there was a God
[1:28:39] somewhere.
[1:28:41] Yet you were a what? Sinner.
[1:28:45] Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory.
[1:28:47] Amen. Amen. Amen. So when you were a
[1:28:50] sinner, you were God.
[1:28:53] [Applause]
[1:28:58] [Applause]
[1:29:03] That's right. When you were a sinner,
[1:29:06] you were the word of God.
[1:29:12] Hallelujah.
[1:29:13] Thank you, Jesus. Amen.
[1:29:16] Today internet will fly. Amen. He says
[1:29:20] there were a god where? Somewhere.
[1:29:23] Somewhere where? There were a god
[1:29:26] somewhere yet you were what? A sinner.
[1:29:28] You remember that? Congregation stay
[1:29:32] quiet. Amen.
[1:29:37] Congregation says what? Amen. H if you
[1:29:40] don't find yourself that's your problem.
[1:29:42] He said congregation says what? Amen.
[1:29:45] Certainly. Now, what was that?
[1:29:50] Praise your holy name. Can we read?
[1:29:53] That was the leader form of life where
[1:29:57] in you then.
[1:30:02] Hallelujah. Did you have eternal life?
[1:30:06] You see how you have a problem
[1:30:07] answering?
[1:30:09] He says, "And then after a while, you
[1:30:12] heard what the gospel." Maybe you went
[1:30:14] to what? Church. You picked up this and
[1:30:17] that and went from what? Denomination to
[1:30:20] denomination. But one day, you being
[1:30:22] part of who? You had to be part of what?
[1:30:26] The word.
[1:30:29] In other words, you are a a a fragment
[1:30:31] of the word. You are a portion of God.
[1:30:36] You are a piece of God.
[1:30:39] He says you you you have to be part of
[1:30:41] the word. And when you heard what the
[1:30:43] word, you know where you come from. You
[1:30:46] know what was what? True. You were
[1:30:49] always
[1:30:51] always when you were sinner. Always
[1:30:54] what? The seed.
[1:30:57] The seed was where? In you always. The
[1:31:00] seed is what? The word of God. Word of
[1:31:03] God.
[1:31:05] The word of God was where? In you
[1:31:08] always. When? Always he say you was you
[1:31:12] were always the seed was in you how
[1:31:15] always the word
[1:31:18] seen the word that was in you
[1:31:24] [Applause]
[1:31:26] sir is it complicated where is
[1:31:29] brotherham getting this stuff
[1:31:32] now today you understand that's why
[1:31:34] never challenge a prophet because the
[1:31:36] prophet is perfectly in line with the
[1:31:38] Bible
[1:31:39] Brother Brandham said, "The word sees
[1:31:42] the word in you. The pillar of fire saw
[1:31:45] the word in you. The seed sees the seed
[1:31:48] in you." Because you are the word and
[1:31:51] God is the word. The word son of man saw
[1:31:54] the word set.
[1:31:59] The word Jesus Christ saw the world.
[1:32:01] Michael
[1:32:05] the word Jesus Christ saw the world
[1:32:07] Olivia. And then the word married the
[1:32:11] word.
[1:32:14] Are we together? The word seen the word
[1:32:17] that was where that was before the
[1:32:20] foundation of what? He saw the word and
[1:32:24] you come to it.
[1:32:26] [Music]
[1:32:28] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. When you were a
[1:32:31] sinner, where was that devil?
[1:32:36] Now that you become the word, Amen.
[1:32:38] Right, brother? What is the devil?
[1:32:41] Because when you were ignorant of your
[1:32:43] weapon, he could not do anything. Amen.
[1:32:47] Now you are aware of your weapon. What
[1:32:50] do you think happened?
[1:32:57] Let me continue. Let's go back to our
[1:32:59] scripture. We on Matthew 20, Matthew 12.
[1:33:03] Which verse, my friend? Uh Matthew 13.
[1:33:06] Which verse are we at?
[1:33:10] 25. 24. We there. Amen. The kingdom of
[1:33:14] heaven is likened unto a man which seth
[1:33:16] what? Good seed in his field. Now we
[1:33:18] understand what it means. Now
[1:33:21] remember it's good seed. Good means God.
[1:33:25] So you are the word of God. That's why
[1:33:27] the word could come to you.
[1:33:30] The word come to the word.
[1:33:35] Amen. We understand now the Bible says
[1:33:39] but while men slept
[1:33:42] his enemy
[1:33:45] so this son of man already have an enemy
[1:33:50] amen.
[1:33:52] Are we together? Yes. Remember the son
[1:33:55] of man is sowing good seed. Amen. The
[1:33:58] project
[1:34:01] of the son of man is for the seed to
[1:34:04] reproduce
[1:34:06] themsself according to their own
[1:34:09] identity.
[1:34:10] So the son of man sowed God
[1:34:14] and he was expecting for God to come
[1:34:17] out.
[1:34:17] [Applause]
[1:34:21] The son of man sold the word. So the
[1:34:24] crop that is coming up will be nothing
[1:34:27] but the word.
[1:34:29] Are we together? The son of man sold
[1:34:32] God. The crop that is coming is a divine
[1:34:36] crop. So the plan of the son of man is
[1:34:40] for good crops.
[1:34:45] We together. We together. Verse 25. But
[1:34:50] while men slept, his enemy came and did
[1:34:52] what? So tear among what? To wheat. And
[1:34:56] went what? His way. Why didn't the enemy
[1:34:59] sow the tear before
[1:35:02] the wheat? Come on now, brother. Come on
[1:35:06] now, brother. Come on, brother. When the
[1:35:09] field was empty, the enemy doesn't do
[1:35:12] anything. I hope we are together. Are we
[1:35:15] together? When the son of man pulled the
[1:35:18] seeds and begin to sow
[1:35:22] divine s. Amen. And so Charlene,
[1:35:27] and so brother patient and so Tramen and
[1:35:31] so brother Tony when the se when the son
[1:35:34] of man begin to sow. Are we together?
[1:35:37] Amen. He was sowing good good seed.
[1:35:42] You follow me? The presence of good seed
[1:35:47] trouble the enemy.
[1:35:53] [Music]
[1:35:56] The one who called the enemy to come is
[1:35:59] the nature of the seed.
[1:36:03] Because the seed is good.
[1:36:06] It can only develop with evil.
[1:36:09] [Applause]
[1:36:12] [Music]
[1:36:16] Amen. If this is too strong, you tell
[1:36:19] me. But I don't have any choice. I'm
[1:36:21] going to sh this into you, my friend.
[1:36:24] Are we together? Are we together? The
[1:36:27] thoughts of God are not evil.
[1:36:32] They are for good to give you an
[1:36:34] expected end so that at the end time you
[1:36:37] going to become a god but that thought
[1:36:41] to always pull something
[1:36:44] the nature of the crop is what bring the
[1:36:46] trouble the enemy when he saw you
[1:36:53] and he knew who you were
[1:36:57] amen Amen. Amen.
[1:37:00] The enemy say I cannot leave this crop
[1:37:02] like this. I need to put some trouble
[1:37:05] maker in the church.
[1:37:09] [Music]
[1:37:11] [Applause]
[1:37:15] Let me leave it. Amen. Can I continue?
[1:37:18] Can I continue? We clear. We getting
[1:37:20] somewhere. Verse 26. Go ahead, my
[1:37:24] friend.
[1:37:26] But when the blade was what?
[1:37:30] Sprung up and brought forth what? Ah,
[1:37:34] there appear what?
[1:37:38] Amen. If this son of man knew that he
[1:37:42] has his enemy. Why didn't he protect his
[1:37:46] field?
[1:37:48] Yeah, brother. Amen. Good question.
[1:37:50] Amen. Because his enemy always is there
[1:37:52] to sabotage you.
[1:37:55] But the son of man left the field open
[1:38:00] to the enemy and the enemy say ah now
[1:38:04] he's not around. He's sleeping. Men are
[1:38:07] sleeping. Okay, let me go ahead and now
[1:38:10] begin to throw certain things there so
[1:38:12] he will be surprised.
[1:38:14] We clear verse 27. So the servant of the
[1:38:19] householder came and said to him,
[1:38:22] "Sir, did you uh did not you sow what?
[1:38:26] Good seeds. Good children
[1:38:28] in your field. From where then cometh
[1:38:32] what tears?" So who attracted the tears?
[1:38:40] Don't worry, we will get there. Who
[1:38:42] attracted? Remember it's the attribute.
[1:38:44] You remember that Sunday that pull
[1:38:46] trouble.
[1:38:48] It's it it's what God is trying to
[1:38:50] accomplish in your life that is what
[1:38:53] pull trouble
[1:38:56] [Music]
[1:38:57] no trouble nothing
[1:39:01] you don't worth anything we clear are we
[1:39:04] together oh God help me verse uh uh 28
[1:39:09] he says to them a what an enemy how did
[1:39:12] he know he was an
[1:39:14] enemy so if you know that he was an
[1:39:16] enemy me. Why didn't you protect the
[1:39:19] field? Amen.
[1:39:23] And you are putting good seed. Would you
[1:39:26] leave good seed to the mercy of
[1:39:28] everything? No.
[1:39:31] The good seed work somewhere. Can I
[1:39:34] continue? He says he says to them, "An
[1:39:37] enemy has done it." The servant said to
[1:39:40] him, "Will you then that we go and do
[1:39:43] what?" Gather them up. In other word, so
[1:39:47] these things are going to cause trouble
[1:39:49] to your seed. Yes, sir. Amen. We want
[1:39:52] your seed to grow easily. Amen.
[1:39:57] Prospering.
[1:40:01] Amen.
[1:40:02] Without trouble, a quiet environment,
[1:40:08] everybody loving you.
[1:40:11] If you bump here, it's a seed. You bump
[1:40:13] here, it's a God. You bump there, it's a
[1:40:15] God. You go here, it's a God. You move
[1:40:18] for backward, God. You go forward, God.
[1:40:20] You sleep, God.
[1:40:23] So, let's go ahead and remove the tears
[1:40:26] so we can clean up the environment. It
[1:40:29] looks good.
[1:40:31] But it's contrary to the purpose.
[1:40:37] [Music]
[1:40:37] [Applause]
[1:40:39] My friend, are we together? I hope we
[1:40:42] don't have stairs here. Amen. Amen.
[1:40:46] Because brother Brandham said the word
[1:40:48] tear means brier.
[1:40:51] It means we
[1:40:53] and brother Brandham give all type of
[1:40:55] terms that he knows. There are many of
[1:40:57] them but they are put there to
[1:41:04] okay let me continue. The Bible says and
[1:41:08] then he says verse 9 29 but he says to
[1:41:12] them what nay means what
[1:41:17] Lord there is trouble with the good seed
[1:41:21] let's go remove the trouble so the seed
[1:41:24] will go good
[1:41:26] the son of man say
[1:41:34] why not
[1:41:36] He says, "Nay, lest water you gather up
[1:41:40] the tears while you gather up the tears,
[1:41:44] you root up also the wheat with them."
[1:41:49] So trying to remove that evil,
[1:41:54] I'm reading the Bible. It will cause you
[1:41:56] also trouble.
[1:41:59] Amen.
[1:42:01] In other word, your
[1:42:03] development. Right.
[1:42:06] Require those tears.
[1:42:13] Amen. Lord, remove those tears. Remove
[1:42:16] those tears. Remove those TH.
[1:42:20] Okay. Don't worry. Don't worry, my
[1:42:22] friend. Anyway, I don't even expect amen
[1:42:25] on this because I know when we are
[1:42:27] cramming, right? Read there. Verse 30.
[1:42:31] Let both
[1:42:33] do what? Grow together.
[1:42:38] This is hard stuff, my friend. So when
[1:42:40] the son of man is coming with his
[1:42:43] irrigation, he's watering. Take your
[1:42:46] time, brother. He's watering. What is
[1:42:49] the purpose of the son of man? To water
[1:42:51] who? His own seed. His own seed. But
[1:42:54] guess what? Who else is getting the the
[1:42:55] the water?
[1:42:59] Take the tower. So when the anointing is
[1:43:01] coming down
[1:43:02] [Applause]
[1:43:04] Yes sir. Yes sir. That's why I have to
[1:43:08] be me because I don't know who you are.
[1:43:11] Yes sir.
[1:43:14] Because the anointing is sent for me.
[1:43:18] Are we together? Are we together? The
[1:43:21] intent of the rain, of the water, of the
[1:43:25] irrigation is not for the te but the
[1:43:28] tear being under the same field also get
[1:43:32] the blessing.
[1:43:34] [Applause]
[1:43:39] Is that complicated? But the only
[1:43:42] problem is the wit change toward
[1:43:46] and become more God. But the thing won't
[1:43:50] change
[1:43:54] [Applause]
[1:43:56] [Music]
[1:43:57] if you sit under an atmosphere like this
[1:44:02] for a long time and you don't change.
[1:44:04] Watch out.
[1:44:06] [Applause]
[1:44:14] Five years you still mean. Watch out
[1:44:18] because the water is coming so you can
[1:44:21] become God.
[1:44:25] [Applause]
[1:44:26] But if you don't change, something is
[1:44:29] wrong. Because the water doesn't change
[1:44:32] the nature.
[1:44:34] You become bad.
[1:44:39] Yes sir. Are we together? Are we
[1:44:42] together? Are we together? Amen. Are we
[1:44:45] together? Jesus said, "Don't don't
[1:44:47] remove it. Leave them together." Because
[1:44:50] if you remove one, you cause trouble to
[1:44:52] the other. When do we remove them? Verse
[1:44:55] 29, he said, uh, verse 30, let both of
[1:44:59] them do what? Grow together. Until when?
[1:45:02] The harvest. Do you know what the
[1:45:04] harvest means? The harvest means you
[1:45:07] have reached maturity.
[1:45:12] Amen. So when you reach maturity that's
[1:45:14] when they come and remove the tear. In
[1:45:17] other words, the tear,
[1:45:20] you must love the
[1:45:23] love your enemy.
[1:45:28] Love your enemy. The one who does bad
[1:45:31] for you, he's actually
[1:45:34] fertilizing.
[1:45:35] [Applause]
[1:45:38] He's there as a fertilizer.
[1:45:41] [Applause]
[1:45:43] until maturity.
[1:45:45] [Applause]
[1:45:47] So enemy do your job. Me I do my job.
[1:45:52] You keep troubling the church. Me I'm
[1:45:54] moving forward with the church.
[1:46:00] [Applause]
[1:46:01] [Music]
[1:46:02] [Applause]
[1:46:03] Are we together? Either you going to
[1:46:06] move with the church or you going to do
[1:46:08] the daddy job. But remember your daddy
[1:46:10] job made spoken word prosper.
[1:46:19] [Applause]
[1:46:20] Are we together? Are we together?
[1:46:26] I didn't write the Bible. I'm only
[1:46:28] reading the Bible. Brother Tony, are we
[1:46:30] together? He says you leave them till
[1:46:33] the harvest. In other words, it is very
[1:46:36] important for your maturity. Amen.
[1:46:46] Remember the field is what? So in this
[1:46:50] world your maturity require
[1:46:55] the devil is working for you my friend.
[1:47:00] All the headache
[1:47:03] sir. All the pain,
[1:47:06] everything that is going on, it is
[1:47:08] shaping you up to become more God.
[1:47:12] [Music]
[1:47:14] Remember, you won't change. You will you
[1:47:16] you will always be God. But to bring God
[1:47:20] out of you, you need a Pharaoh with a
[1:47:23] heart that is hardened.
[1:47:29] An unconverted
[1:47:32] Pharaoh. Because the more Pharaoh
[1:47:34] hardened, the more the miracle multiply.
[1:47:38] Can I continue? The Bible say, "Let both
[1:47:41] of them do what?" Grow together until
[1:47:44] what? The harvest. And in the time of
[1:47:47] the harvest, I will gather. I will say
[1:47:49] to the reapers, do what? Gather, gather
[1:47:52] together first the water, the tears. And
[1:47:54] do what? Bind them in the bundle to be
[1:47:57] water. Burn them. This is another
[1:47:59] mystery. But gather the wheat into
[1:48:01] water. in my barn. So we clear now? The
[1:48:04] good seed is what brought the bad seed
[1:48:07] because the bad seed are important to
[1:48:10] fertilize the soil so that the good seed
[1:48:13] can grow very good.
[1:48:15] Are we together? Now let's go to
[1:48:17] Ephesians
[1:48:21] 2. I'm almost going to be finished with
[1:48:23] the reading of the
[1:48:27] Bible. Ah yeah yeah
[1:48:30] yeah. When you go to heaven, that's
[1:48:32] where there is no tears.
[1:48:36] But in here, you need tears.
[1:48:42] That's why Joseph could go and say,
[1:48:44] "Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ, this
[1:48:47] spirit upon pifer house, go back to hell
[1:48:51] in Jesus name. You need that
[1:48:55] to tell a lie. So you move you to the
[1:48:58] next station.
[1:49:06] I cast the devil. It's not going out.
[1:49:08] Jesus say some devil need to go by
[1:49:09] fasting. Uhhuh.
[1:49:13] Mrs. Matifa in Jesus name. You see her
[1:49:16] tomorrow. Hey cutie.
[1:49:20] [Music]
[1:49:24] You must stand as a child of God to
[1:49:28] prove to her that I don't bow down to
[1:49:30] this type of spirit.
[1:49:33] [Applause]
[1:49:39] Are we together? Are we together? Uhhuh.
[1:49:42] Where are we at? Ephesians 2 verse uh
[1:49:46] uh 10 if you
[1:49:47] there. Glory to God.
[1:49:50] If you don't understand this thing, you
[1:49:52] will be suffering.
[1:49:54] Amen.
[1:49:56] For we are what? His workmanship. You
[1:49:59] know what it means, right? We are his
[1:50:02] masterpiece.
[1:50:04] Amen. We are his workmanship. The
[1:50:06] workmanship of God. We are his
[1:50:09] workmanship created where? In Christ
[1:50:12] Jesus.

[1:50:17] the work. Good works.

[1:50:25] And your work that you were created for
[1:50:27] are what? Good works. Good works. And
[1:50:30] good means what? God. So your work is
[1:50:33] the work of who? God. Because you are
[1:50:36] who? God.
[1:50:40] [Music]
[1:50:43] Created unto good work. Amen.
[1:50:47] Let's see when those work was put in you
[1:50:50] created unto good works. You there which
[1:50:54] God
[1:50:58] had what? Before before ordained before
[1:51:01] what? Ordained. In other words, God
[1:51:04] already plan
[1:51:07] that we should do what? Walk with them.
[1:51:10] So those work you you pray in them or
[1:51:13] you walk in them.
[1:51:17] Do you have to do anything?
[1:51:23] That's why that's why that's why you
[1:51:27] will see people treated you bad. And you
[1:51:31] make decision. You sign paperwork. You
[1:51:34] finish your whole war from this time,
[1:51:37] from that time. I would never do this,
[1:51:39] this, this. And after a while, you just
[1:51:41] feel like I need to help them.
[1:51:44] You just can't help being bad because
[1:51:47] you were predestinated to good work.
[1:51:50] [Applause]
[1:51:54] Even if you want to be bad, you will
[1:51:56] feel something in you say uh just
[1:51:59] forgive them. Give them what they want.
[1:52:01] It means you are God.
[1:52:04] [Music]
[1:52:05] Amen. Because your father sent the rain
[1:52:09] on the just and the unjust. So you can't
[1:52:12] help but to be God because you were
[1:52:14] ordained to be God and to show off the
[1:52:18] work of God.
[1:52:20] [Applause]
[1:52:21] [Music]
[1:52:24] Are we good? So you are good seed and
[1:52:29] you were predestinated for good work. So
[1:52:32] in you it is good.
[1:52:36] Amen. Amen. Amen. But when you are too
[1:52:39] good like that, there is a problem.
[1:52:43] Let's go to Romans 7.
[1:52:46] Amen. What is the problem of you being
[1:52:49] good and predestinated for good work?
[1:52:53] Let's go to Romans 7, my friend. We
[1:52:56] almost there, my friend. Romans 7 verse
[1:52:59] 18. If you dare, you can say amen. Amen.
[1:53:02] For I know
[1:53:04] that in me that is where
[1:53:08] dwelleth water
[1:53:11] because inside you you are good. Take
[1:53:15] your time brother. Take your time. Take
[1:53:19] your time. Mr. Eva must come a little
[1:53:22] bit closer to help the good in you grow.
[1:53:33] Is that okay?
[1:53:36] Flesh.
[1:53:38] This is you.

[1:53:43] Remember the attribute of good pull
[1:53:45] somebody
[1:53:50] it brings evil
[1:53:53] because good develop in the midst of
[1:53:55] evil.
[1:53:57] Paul say in me in my flesh I found that
[1:54:02] there is evil.
[1:54:07] Why is evil in the flesh?
[1:54:12] Amen. Verse uh 18 he say for I know that
[1:54:16] in me that is where in my flesh dwelleth
[1:54:19] what? no good thing for to will is
[1:54:22] present with me. But how to perform that
[1:54:26] which is good, I do what? I find none.
[1:54:28] So somebody's troubling Paul. Amen.
[1:54:31] Verse 19. For the good
[1:54:35] that I would do, I do not. But the what?
[1:54:39] The evil which I would not that I do. In
[1:54:41] other words, I don't want to do it, but
[1:54:44] I find myself trapped.
[1:54:47] Amen. That's why Paul is crying Christ
[1:54:49] remove this
[1:54:55] stand Paul stay with him take him till
[1:55:00] full redemption
[1:55:02] show to him that you are God
[1:55:05] bring him under subjection let him obey
[1:55:08] you teach him a lesson
[1:55:13] teach thy evil a lesson tell him when I
[1:55:16] speak you quiet because I am God.
[1:55:23] When he doesn't want to go to church,
[1:55:25] you tell him you you going to church and
[1:55:28] you going to praise God and I'm going to
[1:55:31] show you you will obey me. Before you
[1:55:33] know it, he begin to obey because he

[1:55:40] [Applause]
[1:55:42] Are we together? Are we together? Are we
[1:55:46] together my friend? This help our
[1:55:48] Christian walk to go to become now easy
[1:55:52] to become something that we enjoy
[1:55:54] because we know which button to push
[1:56:03] [Music]
[1:56:08] if you look at something if you're going
[1:56:10] on the road and there is a billboard
[1:56:14] that is bad and you do this and you do
[1:56:16] this Yeah, brother. The one who did this
[1:56:18] is not you.
[1:56:22] You don't ask forgiveness for that.
[1:56:26] Because he was trapped by the devil.
[1:56:30] Amen. Even though the devil say you saw
[1:56:32] it, you say, "Hey, he was on my way and
[1:56:36] my auto medic moved.
[1:56:39] I will ask forgiveness if I go back
[1:56:41] again but I won't go back because we are
[1:56:45] trouble too much with petty little
[1:56:48] things. You need to understand who you
[1:56:51] are
[1:56:53] because those little stuff make our walk
[1:56:55] like it's too
[1:56:57] burdensome every day. It's like a
[1:56:59] problem. No, be free. I didn't put that
[1:57:04] billboard. I was walking by it. My head
[1:57:08] move. That's your problem.
[1:57:10] [Music]
[1:57:13] If not, you will be all the time. Jesus.
[1:57:18] Jesus. Look at the way women are
[1:57:20] dressed. It is summer. I didn't tell
[1:57:23] them to dress like that.
[1:57:30] I won't be repenting all day. I know who
[1:57:32] I am. I didn't leave my house to last.
[1:57:37] Yes sir. Amen.
[1:57:41] I hope somebody's coming.
[1:57:45] Where are we at, my friend?
[1:57:48] Which one?
[1:57:50] 19. For the good that I would do, I do
[1:57:54] not. But the evil which I would not,
[1:57:56] that I do. Now, if I do that, I would
[1:57:59] not, it is no more I
[1:58:06] This take bones to crack this. It is no
[1:58:10] more I that do it, but what
[1:58:13] that dwelleth where? In me.
[1:58:17] Can I continue? Verse
[1:58:19] 21. I found then a law that when I would
[1:58:24] do what? Good. Evil is what?
[1:58:28] You were predestinated to do good work.
[1:58:31] But when you want to do good,
[1:58:36] evil is present.
[1:58:39] Yes sir. Amen.
[1:58:42] With Nem,
[1:58:44] we would know it today as the law of
[1:58:47] what? Contrast.
[1:58:49] That where there is good,
[1:58:52] there is what? Evil. Where there is
[1:58:54] right, there is what? Wrong. And we will
[1:58:57] never
[1:59:02] No matter what environment may be ever
[1:59:06] be able to do what? Shake ourselves from
[1:59:09] the presence of Ed.
[1:59:14] Amen. Don't worry my friend because Paul
[1:59:17] say when I do what good then what evil's
[1:59:20] present the sinner will never be able to
[1:59:23] shake away from the Christian and the
[1:59:26] Christian from what the sinner there
[1:59:28] will be a witness there of right and a
[1:59:31] witness of what wrong how many times
[1:59:34] always and you make your choice you have
[1:59:37] to take the side one side or what but
[1:59:41] you got to stand for what is right
[1:59:44] Because you know you are a good seed for
[1:59:47] orained for good work. So God sent you
[1:59:51] here for a purpose to manifest who is
[1:59:54] God. Amen.
[1:59:57] Are we together? Are we together? Oh my
[2:00:02] God.
[2:00:03] Oh praise God.
[2:00:06] Glory to God. Amen. Brother Brham says
[2:00:09] this that I ask him for something
[2:00:11] sometime he shake his head and he says
[2:00:14] what? And I just rejoice as much that as
[2:00:17] I can. If he says what? Yes. Because if
[2:00:20] he knows if it's his will it's a whole
[2:00:22] lot of better than what? Yes. If it's
[2:00:25] the will to do it that is when you
[2:00:27] really do what? So now at this point we
[2:00:30] understand that our prayer goes with
[2:00:32] time. He goes with season and he also
[2:00:36] goes with purpose because according to
[2:00:39] Ecclesiastes 3:1 to everything there is
[2:00:43] a what and a time to every purpose where
[2:00:47] under the heaven remember those
[2:00:49] principle my friend and you will uh uh
[2:00:52] stay away from brother pressure. Brother
[2:00:54] Brham gave us an advice. He say never be
[2:00:57] hasty. See, do what?
[2:01:00] Take your time and have what? Faith. If
[2:01:03] we have asked God for what? Anything.
[2:01:05] Remember, God answers what? Prayer. But
[2:01:09] he's going to do it in his time, in his
[2:01:12] season, and according to his purpose.
[2:01:15] Amen. Are we together? He does it in his
[2:01:17] time. The way that is what? Best. And
[2:01:20] makes a work just right for what? Us. So
[2:01:23] we know that the your purpose can never
[2:01:25] be defeated. You know that right?
[2:01:28] Brother Brandham says this my friend. He
[2:01:30] says Satan could not take them. He could
[2:01:34] not drawn Noah in the flood. Until what?
[2:01:38] The purpose of God has been fulfilled.
[2:01:40] He could not burn up the Hebrew children
[2:01:43] until what? The purpose of God had been
[2:01:45] finished. He could not kill Job with
[2:01:48] boil and trouble until what? The purpose
[2:01:50] of God had been finished. Neither could
[2:01:53] the lion eat Daniel. Until what? God's
[2:01:56] purpose had been finished. Neither could
[2:01:58] death an old age take Abraham. Until
[2:02:01] what? The purpose of God had been
[2:02:03] finished. And neither can he take you.
[2:02:06] Amen.
[2:02:13] Come on. Or can he take who? Me. until
[2:02:18] what? The purpose of God of our life is
[2:02:21] what? Finished. So if God already took
[2:02:24] brother Brham, what does he mean? The
[2:02:27] purpose is finished. Where is your
[2:02:29] return ministry standing for?
[2:02:32] [Applause]
[2:02:37] You waiting for brother Brham to open
[2:02:39] the seals. Brother Brham cannot die
[2:02:42] without fulfilling that which God sent
[2:02:44] him to do. Amen.
[2:02:48] Amen. Are we together? Amen. So we
[2:02:50] gather from there a what? Consolation.
[2:02:53] That that was paragraph 42 43. Brother
[2:02:57] say and why does God let trouble come?
[2:03:04] Are we together? He says God does what?
[2:03:09] Trouble. In other words, he controls
[2:03:11] trouble.
[2:03:12] put a bit in the mouth and makes it
[2:03:15] water. Obey him. And those trouble bring
[2:03:18] us into a water a fellowship with God.
[2:03:22] The test are important.
[2:03:26] Amen. Are we together? Amen. Are we
[2:03:29] together? God uses the fire of the
[2:03:32] trouble to cook you well
[2:03:36] to prepare you well to light your
[2:03:40] candle. Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:03:43] To develop you more. Because there is a
[2:03:47] key with trouble.
[2:03:49] Glory to God. Brother, I mean the church
[2:03:51] ages say think it not strange concerning
[2:03:54] what the fiery trials that are and that
[2:03:57] are to try you. That is what Peter did.
[2:04:00] What sir? Isn't strange that God want us
[2:04:04] to develop a what? Christlike character
[2:04:07] that comes through what? Suffering. No
[2:04:09] sir. And we all have what trials. We are
[2:04:13] all water. Trials and water chasing. Not
[2:04:16] one but goes through water. That the
[2:04:19] church that is not suffering. Uhhuh.
[2:04:22] Come on. Yes sir.
[2:04:25] Remember you are a church. Remember you
[2:04:28] are church. The church that is not
[2:04:30] suffering. Amen. And is not being what?
[2:04:34] Try. Has not got it. Got it. Amen.
[2:04:42] Amen. Let me read it again. My friend,
[2:04:45] the church that is not what suffering
[2:04:48] and is not being watered has not
[2:04:51] gathered. It is not of God. Amen.
[2:04:54] [Music]
[2:04:56] [Applause]
[2:04:58] And I got a news for you. Spoken word
[2:05:01] 100% from God. That's right. Amen.
[2:05:06] Because this church has been tried and
[2:05:09] has suffered. It is a proof that it came
[2:05:12] from God. Amen.
[2:05:18] Your suffering and your and your trial
[2:05:21] is a proof of where you coming from.
[2:05:23] That's right. Because your development
[2:05:26] requires that. Amen.
[2:05:30] [Applause]
[2:05:34] Hallelujah. Yeah, we talking about a
[2:05:37] multi-life purpose. Brother Steven, you
[2:05:39] have not even start touching on it. Oh,
[2:05:42] glory to God. What? H how do we get in
[2:05:45] the purpose? Brother Brandham say when
[2:05:48] we are expecting saying this guy, he's a
[2:05:51] great person.
[2:05:53] This is a great person in the message. I
[2:05:56] shall lean upon him.
[2:05:59] That does what? Displeases God when you
[2:06:02] do that. Uhhuh. We must lean what? On
[2:06:05] God. And what? God alone. We must not
[2:06:08] trust the ability of what? Ourselves or
[2:06:11] what? Any man name. We must completely
[2:06:13] do it. We yield to God. Amen.
[2:06:16] Amen.
[2:06:18] [Applause]
[2:06:26] You soak it. I was drinking water. You
[2:06:29] soak it. Amen. Brother say no what? No
[2:06:32] ability, I don't care what whose it is,
[2:06:35] will never be used where usable in the
[2:06:38] sight of God. God has to get what? All
[2:06:41] of our abilities where how out of us
[2:06:44] before he can achieve what? His purpose.
[2:06:48] Amen.
[2:06:51] You got to get to the corner. Uh-huh.
[2:06:54] Uhhuh. When you tired and God say now I
[2:06:58] can take him out of water. Amen. Amen.
[2:07:00] Because at the beginning when you still
[2:07:02] have triumph, you are doing your own
[2:07:04] purpose. That's right. But not God
[2:07:06] purpose. That's right. But when you
[2:07:08] tired, then God can achieve his purpose.
[2:07:11] Amen. Of good works that he forain you
[2:07:14] to do. Amen.
[2:07:18] He say if he's got something for us to

[2:13:17] their home so that sickness can strike
[2:13:19] Lazarus. Are we together? And Mary and
[2:13:23] Martha being strong believer they pray
[2:13:25] and they send the request to Jesus. They

[2:14:26] yesterday.
[2:14:28] Somebody else already took the job.
[2:14:31] What's the purpose? I don't need a

[2:15:41] verse 8, the disciple are giving us a
[2:15:45] clue on what Jews are.

[2:15:52] word, based on this verse, Jews
[2:15:57] are bad. Amen.
[2:16:02] Bad boys.
[2:16:04] They're trying to stone the master. Why

[2:17:05] that the son of God might be glorified.
[2:17:07] That the son of God to glorify

[2:17:24] problem. Maybe I didn't fast enough.
[2:17:26] Maybe I left her. I stopped listening to

[2:17:32] these allergies.
[2:17:40] That sickness is not because Lazarus did
[2:17:43] something on. No, it is for the glory of
[2:17:46] God. Amen.
[2:17:49] And because the purpose is the glory of
[2:17:52] God. Amen. And the glorification of the
[2:17:55] son of God, the answer to prayer is
[2:17:58] changing. Amen. Jesus is ignoring that.

[2:19:50] We know that four is the number of the
[2:19:54] earth. That's right. And we know that
[2:19:56] four is the number of deliverance.
[2:20:00] And Jesus waited four days. Let's slow

[3:09:35] what? Reformers. And there have been a
[3:09:37] day that is just a day that can call day
[3:09:40] or what? Nine. Because how many beasts
[3:09:43] do we have? Four. We have four beasts.
[3:09:46] We got a day of a lion. Uhhuh. We got a
[3:09:49] day of an ox. That's right. We got a day
[3:09:52] of the reformer. That's right. But the
[3:09:54] fourth day is the day of an evil. Come
[3:09:56] on. That's when the resurrection,
[3:09:59] comes. Come on. Amen.
[3:10:02] Amen. Are we together? Because the earth
[3:10:06] is the last messenger. That's right. The
[3:10:09] last anointing. The anointing of an
[3:10:11] eagle is the one that brought the dead
[3:10:14] back to life. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[3:10:18] Everybody that went through corruption
[3:10:21] is waiting for the eagle anointing.
[3:10:22] Amen. It is the eagle anointing. Amen.
[3:10:25] The capstone ministry that will pull the
[3:10:28] dead. Amen. From Amen. Come on. God
[3:10:31] bless you.
[3:10:32] Let's God bless you. Amen.
[3:10:40] My friend, time is gone. I got to stop.
[3:10:44] No, I got to stop. I appreciate you
[3:10:48] returning the the minute, but I got to
[3:10:50] let you go home. I don't know where we
[3:10:53] stop. You need to remind me. Thank you,
[3:10:56] Lord.
[3:11:01] Oh, glory to God.
[3:11:04] Martha and Mary.
[3:11:07] Today you have a different perspective
[3:11:09] of Martha.
[3:11:11] Amen. Martha is important.
[3:11:14] Mary is important. You need both of
[3:11:17] them. There are situation it's going to
[3:11:19] be Mary who's going to be strong and
[3:11:21] there are certain situation Mary will be
[3:11:23] slow. But if you a martyr, pick Mary up.
[3:11:27] Give him the secret message of the
[3:11:30] thunder.
[3:11:31] Right. Amen. boost her faith up. You
[3:11:35] say, "I know, sister. You always strong.
[3:11:37] You the one that encourages us. When we
[3:11:39] see you, we get courage. Don't be down.
[3:11:43] Stand up. We are with you together."
[3:11:47] Hallelujah. Let's pray. Heavenly Father,
[3:11:49] Lord, we are approaching you humbly this
[3:11:52] afternoon. Father, we thank you for your
[3:11:54] grace, for your love and your mercy, and
[3:11:57] for everything you have been doing for
[3:11:58] us. Father, I appreciate the church
[3:12:01] giving me the minute to go over, but
[3:12:03] Lord, we felt led to stop here because
[3:12:06] the material continued to go and we want
[3:12:09] your children to soak it in pretty good.
[3:12:11] Father, you spoke to us about a
[3:12:14] multi-purpose even though we have not
[3:12:16] finished the other purposes. But Lord,
[3:12:18] we can see that one thing that looks
[3:12:21] bad, one thing that looks like sorrow,
[3:12:24] something that looks like it's Lord
[3:12:26] tormenting us, but there is a
[3:12:28] multi-purpose behind that one thing.
[3:12:30] Amen. If this event never happened to
[3:12:34] Lazarus, we would not have known the
[3:12:37] true identity of Martha. We have not
[3:12:39] have known your glory as a resurrection.
[3:12:42] We would not have known that the
[3:12:44] disciples still needed encourage so that
[3:12:47] someone who has been in this walk for a
[3:12:49] while and still found himself weak at
[3:12:51] time can refer to this and say that I
[3:12:54] know he can do something to stabilize my
[3:12:57] faith more. Lord, many things has been
[3:13:00] spoken. May you take that which was
[3:13:02] spoken and give it to your children in a
[3:13:04] more abundant revelation. Bless us all
[3:13:07] together. Father be with us for the
[3:13:09] remaining of the day and the oncoming
[3:13:12] week. We commit everything unto their
[3:13:14] hand in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[3:13:17] God bless you church. We love you.

[3:13:22] you. Thank you
