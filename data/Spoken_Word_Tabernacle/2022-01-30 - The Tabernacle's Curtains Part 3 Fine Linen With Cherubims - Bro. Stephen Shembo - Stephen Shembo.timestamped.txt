[40:29] how many are up to date with the sermon
[40:32] let me see your hand
[40:35] somebody's lacking
[40:37] ah man oh my god so if you get lost your
[40:41] gps is lost it's not my fault it's on
[40:44] youtube how many red x of this chapter
[40:46] 26 yesterday
[40:49] okay quite a few people praise the name
[40:51] of the lord if you didn't read it we
[40:53] send a text if you're not receiving text
[40:56] it is not my fault
[40:58] it is your fault to go see the deacon or
[41:01] the trustees and make sure of brother
[41:03] david and make sure you are listed in if
[41:06] you're not receiving the text amen we
[41:08] sent you a text letting you know that
[41:10] the meeting was cancelled because of the
[41:12] snow and then that you should read
[41:14] exodus 26 this is a difficult chapter
[41:17] and if you don't read it you don't have
[41:19] a background it's going to be
[41:20] very easy for you to get lost amen so by
[41:24] this time since we went to the first
[41:25] curtain you should be
[41:27] clear of what is going on amen
[41:30] so amen
[41:32] don't worry we'll turn you out
[41:35] the meeting that we have question and
[41:37] answer was cancelled because of the
[41:38] weather we were
[41:40] not sure whether it's knowing how many
[41:42] inches this one say one two we don't
[41:44] want to put anybody on the risk so just
[41:46] be patient lord's willing we will work
[41:48] out with the deacon and see when we can
[41:50] postpone it and give you a date so if
[41:53] you still have questions god give you a
[41:55] door of mercy bring your question and we
[41:58] will handle it amen
[42:00] i have questions for the young sisters
[42:02] they have not set up a date yet for
[42:05] their meeting they have some really good
[42:08] burners question
[42:10] amen
[42:11] the problem is they don't put their name
[42:16] the only problem i have
[42:17] there is one question that is really
[42:19] really really deep
[42:21] but if the person who they have put the
[42:22] name he would have helped me out
[42:25] but they didn't put the name now
[42:27] i tried there were
[42:29] four of them three of them i used an
[42:31] emergency bullet
[42:33] i loaded and the discernment pop up and
[42:36] told me who did it
[42:38] so the second one
[42:40] i'm still having a hard time to decode
[42:42] who that person is
[42:45] i contacted the person i said did you
[42:47] put the president say yes i say okay no
[42:49] problem the emergency bullet work so the
[42:51] other one is a little bit harder it's a
[42:54] question that is like merit question
[42:57] like
[42:58] non-merit question it's right blending
[43:00] in
[43:01] it's about birth control
[43:05] so when i put my hand on i thought it
[43:08] was something quick and i found myself
[43:10] in the ocean deep there in other words
[43:13] it opened up in the message woo
[43:16] i say oh my god what is going on here
[43:19] before you know it the scripture came
[43:20] out
[43:21] and i say wait a minute how can i find
[43:24] this where did did brother brother give
[43:26] a scripture and a quote came back to my
[43:28] mind
[43:29] and i searched the quote and when i
[43:31] opened that code i found it but i'm
[43:33] giving the scripture in that code
[43:36] so now it's a whole sermon that opened
[43:38] about it i can give you an answer but if
[43:41] a
[43:42] wrong seed somebody is not mature yet
[43:44] they can pick it up and cause damage
[43:47] so i'm just thinking whether i need to
[43:49] tell the young sister plainly and then i
[43:52] have to probably get the married people
[43:54] plainly i can just tell you what brother
[43:56] branham said but probably you won't get
[43:58] it because the message has a back part
[44:00] man
[44:01] when the prophet is saying something
[44:02] there is something behind that if you
[44:04] don't catch it then you don't catch the
[44:06] message then you can repeat the message
[44:08] like a parrot
[44:09] but you're not really repeating the
[44:11] message but if you catch the mind in
[44:14] other words if you catch the message in
[44:16] the message
[44:18] then your sound
[44:20] is different then you will understand
[44:24] why his brother random saying this and
[44:26] this
[44:27] so
[44:28] the way the technology is going on in
[44:31] this world you are exposed to everything
[44:35] until there is not even hardly anything
[44:37] to hide anymore
[44:39] what you think a child doesn't know they
[44:41] already know
[44:42] because they're on youtube
[44:44] they have electronic devices
[44:46] so that have been said upon the
[44:49] authority
[44:50] of the local church i might have to open
[44:53] the fire
[44:54] and just
[44:56] give it up plainly to the young sister
[44:58] the young brother is still cool
[45:00] so you wait
[45:02] amen until somebody opened now you open
[45:05] up then i open up if you cool i wait
[45:07] till you drown then i pull you from the
[45:09] water then i shake you up a little bit i
[45:12] say next time
[45:13] remember okay ask me okay
[45:16] amen
[45:18] i told a young man
[45:20] i say don't go on the internet to learn
[45:23] about women
[45:28] do you hear me
[45:29] do you hear me i told the young man i
[45:32] said if you have a question
[45:35] about a woman
[45:36] come
[45:37] come to me
[45:39] let me sit with you
[45:41] and when you're coming bring your bible
[45:43] then i'm gonna open the bible and i'm
[45:46] going to open brother branham ask me any
[45:49] question you want
[45:52] i say don't go learn
[45:54] don't google it
[45:56] come google in the message
[46:01] amen
[46:03] i spoke to a young man i told him i say
[46:05] i understand you growing up now
[46:08] now you start having puberty the black
[46:10] dog is wide open
[46:12] i say but don't go in the internet come
[46:14] sit with me ask me questions i will tell
[46:16] you
[46:17] let me teach you i'm a doctor also
[46:20] so let me help you out but i don't want
[46:23] you to learn on the internet because
[46:25] what you're learning is perverted
[46:28] amen and you're going to bring spirit
[46:32] and i can show you even a quote where
[46:34] birth control caused trouble to a child
[46:39] and brother branham discern it so you
[46:42] got to know what you're doing
[46:43] especially those that are married
[46:46] recently or the younger one and they're
[46:49] the one not being in church correctly
[46:52] and missing services

[1:00:30] that you go to church
[1:00:32] and call it your
[1:00:35] church
[1:00:37] you cannot have two churches
[1:00:41] all three churches

[1:01:24] and somewhere that you help support the
[1:01:27] cause
[1:01:29] take your church your choice
[1:01:31] but then don't never disfellowship the
[1:01:35] other man because you don't belong with
[1:01:37] your group
[1:01:39] that's why we call them sisters churches
[1:01:42] that's why we meet together we can go to
[1:01:45] one another convention and we can
[1:01:47] fellowship together
[1:01:50] especially when they are in the message
[1:01:52] [Music]
[1:01:54] i have learned a little better than that
[1:01:57] now every person that is saved
[1:02:01] how many are saved
[1:02:02] [Music]
[1:02:04] so some of you are not saved i didn't
[1:02:06] see your hand how many people are saved
[1:02:08] [Music]
[1:02:10] okay if you now save that fire and i'm
[1:02:12] going to teach you how to get saved
[1:02:15] proud will kill you
[1:02:17] every person that is saved or to have a
[1:02:21] church home
[1:02:22] [Music]
[1:02:23] they ought to be in church
[1:02:28] and there
[1:02:31] sometimes
[1:02:35] every time that church has a service
[1:02:40] can you say amen
[1:02:42] or every time you pass it
[1:02:45] go in
[1:02:46] open the doors and go in and pray or do
[1:02:50] something
[1:02:52] how many of you have felt that
[1:02:59] you're not here did you stream
[1:03:03] you're home you're not streaming
[1:03:06] brother branham say i believe that every
[1:03:09] person should join the church
[1:03:12] i absolutely believe that every person
[1:03:15] should stand at their post of duty when
[1:03:18] there
[1:03:22] when their where the pastor is there
[1:03:25] preaching
[1:03:31] no there is a birthday going on over
[1:03:33] there
[1:03:34] there is a party going on over there no
[1:03:36] there is a friend that is coming to meet
[1:03:38] me over there
[1:03:42] and when there are pastors there
[1:03:44] preaching or evangelists or something i
[1:03:47] think they ought to stand at their post
[1:03:50] of duty i'm not a deacon i'm not a
[1:03:52] trustee that's not what he's talking
[1:03:54] about
[1:03:55] they ought to support that church with
[1:03:58] everything they got in them
[1:04:06] with their tithing
[1:04:08] why should i preach again tardy
[1:04:11] when i preached to you in a hotel and
[1:04:12] demonstrated and you still stubborn
[1:04:18] you're not cheating me
[1:04:22] i'm going to get taught and give it to
[1:04:24] the poor brother brandon i'm said no no
[1:04:26] you need the code come and see me
[1:04:33] ask the trustee where your task goes
[1:04:36] ask the treasurer
[1:04:38] they will tell you
[1:04:40] amen
[1:04:42] they got
[1:04:43] them with their tithing
[1:04:45] with their offering
[1:04:48] with anything that they are called on to
[1:04:51] do
[1:04:52] be willing and happy
[1:04:54] if your pastor asks you to do something
[1:04:57] in your church you should do it
[1:05:00] that is good
[1:05:02] but don't let that
[1:05:04] just be the only thing get inoculated
[1:05:07] first
[1:05:08] that is what i'm trying to tell you get
[1:05:11] the water
[1:05:12] do you see your problem
[1:05:15] it's a lack of a holy ghost in the
[1:05:17] message
[1:05:19] believers

[1:14:48] verse one
[1:14:50] moreover
[1:14:52] you shall make the tabernacle with ten
[1:14:55] curtains
[1:14:57] of fine twine lining you already know
[1:15:00] what it means now the righteousness of
[1:15:02] the sand
[1:15:03] and blue the spirit of truth
[1:15:05] the spirit of perfect fellowship
[1:15:08] and purple royalty
[1:15:10] adoption and scarlet redemption
[1:15:14] royalty
[1:15:16] with kerry beams of cunning work shall
[1:15:19] you make them you might be seated
[1:15:25] this curtain
[1:15:27] of fine linen
[1:15:31] is made
[1:15:34] of blue
[1:15:35] you know what it means
[1:15:37] of purple
[1:15:39] we already checked that one
[1:15:41] of scarlet
[1:15:43] and now we're going to deal with kerry
[1:15:45] beams
[1:15:48] remember this curtain
[1:15:50] is what we call the tabernacle
[1:15:54] hey mark here
[1:15:55] so when you call tabernacle this is the
[1:15:57] curtain
[1:15:58] anybody clear job to verse seven
[1:16:02] and you shall make
[1:16:04] curtain of god's hair
[1:16:07] we will get to this
[1:16:09] to be a covering upon the tabernacle in
[1:16:13] other words the goat hair curtain
[1:16:16] is the curtain that covered this curtain
[1:16:20] everybody okay
[1:16:21] upon the tabernacle eleventh curtain
[1:16:24] shall you make
[1:16:26] so this curtain
[1:16:29] when you look from the outside you won't
[1:16:31] see it
[1:16:34] anybody okay
[1:16:35] because the tabernacle when it was built
[1:16:38] it was built with wood
[1:16:46] america that's the way the tabernacle
[1:16:49] was built everybody here this side here
[1:16:53] the back side of the tub and across the
[1:16:55] west
[1:16:58] everybody okay
[1:16:59] then we have the
[1:17:00] north then we have the south
[1:17:04] then we have the east
[1:17:06] the door was on the east so when you
[1:17:09] entered the tabernacle you were entering
[1:17:12] brother
[1:17:14] charles
[1:17:15] from the east
[1:17:18] anybody here
[1:17:19] so if i take this and flip it
[1:17:22] you have something like this
[1:17:25] north
[1:17:27] west
[1:17:29] south
[1:17:31] and east
[1:17:32] so the door was coming this way okay so
[1:17:36] first they put the wood
[1:17:39] the framing
[1:17:40] when they finish the framing that's when
[1:17:43] this first curtain the tabernacle come
[1:17:46] and come over it
[1:17:48] and cover it
[1:17:50] when they put it you can see it
[1:17:52] if you go around the tabernacle you will
[1:17:54] see that curtain
[1:17:56] everybody
[1:17:57] but when they brought the second curtain
[1:18:01] and they put it on top of this curtain
[1:18:04] this curtain became invisible
[1:18:08] anybody here
[1:18:10] because after the second curtain they
[1:18:12] put the third one and they put the
[1:18:14] fourth one so you can go all around the
[1:18:18] tabernacle here you will never see this
[1:18:20] curtain
[1:18:23] everybody okay so far
[1:18:26] but there was one way to see that
[1:18:28] curtain
[1:18:30] everybody knows
[1:18:31] for you to see that curtain
[1:18:34] you must go inside
[1:18:36] the tabernacle do you follow me
[1:18:39] so when you enter the tabernacle if you
[1:18:42] look on the side it's wood
[1:18:44] overlay with gold you still don't see
[1:18:47] the curtain
[1:18:48] if you look on the back it's wood
[1:18:50] overlay with curt uh we we with gold you
[1:18:53] don't see the curtain if you look over
[1:18:55] there it's wood because the curtain was
[1:18:58] going on the outside of the wood
[1:19:00] everybody
[1:19:01] so when you enter here you look it's
[1:19:03] gold you look there it's gold you look
[1:19:06] over there it's gold so over here you
[1:19:09] got gold
[1:19:10] over there gold
[1:19:12] over here gold
[1:19:14] where is that curtain
[1:19:16] the only way you can see that curtain is
[1:19:20] when you enter the tabernacle
[1:19:22] and when you look up
[1:19:25] [Music]
[1:19:27] everybody okay
[1:19:28] everybody okay
[1:19:30] so this stubborn across the roof
[1:19:36] the inside roof
[1:19:39] of the tabernacle itself
[1:19:43] so when you enter the holy the other
[1:19:46] court you won't see it
[1:19:48] anybody okay
[1:19:49] you have to enter in the holy place
[1:19:52] then when you look up you will see that
[1:19:54] beautiful purple scarlet blue you say
[1:19:58] wow
[1:20:00] i never knew there is something like
[1:20:01] this
[1:20:02] anybody here when you come outside you
[1:20:05] look you don't see it because it's
[1:20:07] covered
[1:20:08] everybody okay so far
[1:20:10] let's go to chapter 27
[1:20:14] hallelujah
[1:20:16] verse 20.
[1:20:18] relax
[1:20:20] we're gonna drop somewhere
[1:20:21] amen
[1:20:23] chapter 27 verse 20
[1:20:26] and you shall command the children of
[1:20:28] israel that they bring you pure oil
[1:20:32] olive beaten for the light
[1:20:35] to cause the lamb to burn
[1:20:39] so the
[1:20:40] the those lamps are supposed to be
[1:20:42] burning all the time
[1:20:46] i tried to get in those lamp and
[1:20:48] something open up
[1:20:50] the prayer
[1:20:51] and understood the quote brother branham
[1:20:53] gave on the time of prayer
[1:20:55] i said my god how can you how can
[1:20:57] brother brother and be so accurate verse
[1:21:00] 21 in the tabernacle of the congregation
[1:21:04] outside the veil which is before the
[1:21:06] testimony aaron and his son
[1:21:10] the high priest and his son
[1:21:11] shall order it from evening to morning
[1:21:14] not from morning to evening
[1:21:18] we'll get maybe down the road
[1:21:20] from evening to morning before the lord
[1:21:23] it shall be a statute forever to their
[1:21:27] generation on behalf of the children of
[1:21:29] who israel what i'm trying to draw there
[1:21:33] is the light the candlestick
[1:21:36] inside the tabernacle
[1:21:39] where maintained
[1:21:43] by

[1:22:15] days
[1:22:16] there was no open water
[1:22:19] why

[1:22:35] and before the lamp of god
[1:22:38] everybody okay
[1:22:40] went what
[1:22:42] so there was a possibility that this
[1:22:45] lamp can go out
[1:22:49] if the priest
[1:22:51] is not careful
[1:22:56] because the tabernacle have three lamps
[1:23:04] when they built the tabernacle they

[1:24:29] candlestick
[1:24:32] and this light have to be maintained

[1:24:47] that's all
[1:24:49] here was the ark on top of the ark was
[1:24:52] the mercy seat and on top of the mercies

[1:28:41] yet in other words what is still missing
[1:28:45] that i feel like
[1:28:47] i don't have eternal life
[1:28:49] so despite all of this
[1:28:52] the young the rich young ruler
[1:28:54] understood that something is missing
[1:28:59] christ i did what the preacher say
[1:29:02] but i'm still missing something
[1:29:05] what am i missing
[1:29:06] let's pray heavenly father lord we thank
[1:29:10] you for your grace your love your mercy
[1:29:12] and for everything you have been doing
[1:29:14] for us father this is what a man can do
[1:29:17] if you given him ability to do is just
[1:29:20] read the scripture but when he comes to
[1:29:22] interpret and blessing your children he
[1:29:24] only take an action from the holy spirit
[1:29:27] father may you move me completely out of
[1:29:29] the way
[1:29:30] may you come and speak to your children
[1:29:33] may you remove every demonic spirit that
[1:29:35] is trying to attack and bring resentment
[1:29:38] to this service father will rebuke them
[1:29:40] back to hell in the name of jesus christ
[1:29:43] be the alpha and the omega of this
[1:29:46] service in jesus precious name amen
[1:29:49] god bless you put your seat belt and let
[1:29:51] it go
[1:29:52] amen
[1:29:53] we are on the tabernacle curtains
[1:29:57] part three we are still dealing with the
[1:30:00] fine linen
[1:30:01] when we started with the lever
[1:30:04] we found out that the level involved the
[1:30:06] high priest
[1:30:08] and his family amen
[1:30:10] because god chose aaron and his son and
[1:30:14] god chose them to give them the priest
[1:30:17] office
[1:30:19] anybody okay so far
[1:30:21] but
[1:30:22] we found out that the government of
[1:30:24] aaron
[1:30:25] was different than the garment of his
[1:30:28] children
[1:30:29] yet the anointing of aaron
[1:30:33] was the same as the anointing of his
[1:30:36] children
[1:30:37] the bible says and that shall anoint
[1:30:40] them the children of aaron
[1:30:43] as that did anoint their father
[1:30:46] that they may minister unto me in the
[1:30:49] priest's office so the priest office was
[1:30:51] given to aaron and to his children
[1:30:55] and the anointing that was upon aaron
[1:30:58] was the same anointing upon his children
[1:31:01] but yet their garment was different
[1:31:05] anybody okay
[1:31:07] a priest
[1:31:08] could approach the tabernacle and enter
[1:31:11] here and nothing happened to him
[1:31:14] anybody
[1:31:17] a priest a son of aaron could approach
[1:31:20] and enter here and nothing happened to
[1:31:22] him
[1:31:23] everybody
[1:31:25] but a son of aaron
[1:31:27] could not enter right here
[1:31:32] even though he was chosen
[1:31:34] even though he had the same anointing as
[1:31:38] aaron his father
[1:31:39] he was forbidden to enter here
[1:31:43] if he enter here god kill him
[1:31:48] we got the anointing
[1:31:50] but we still have an access of god that
[1:31:53] is blocked
[1:31:55] yet we are the sons of the high priest
[1:31:57] the only person that was able to enter
[1:32:00] here
[1:32:01] was aaron
[1:32:03] aaron could pass here
[1:32:05] no problem
[1:32:06] here no problem
[1:32:08] here once a year no problem with the
[1:32:11] blood and god doesn't kill him in other
[1:32:14] words the high priest have certain
[1:32:16] privilege more than his children
[1:32:20] yet they were anointed the same way
[1:32:25] how can we solve this problem
[1:32:31] hallelujah
[1:32:32] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:32:34] when we spoke about the first curtain
[1:32:37] we found out that curtin was called the
[1:32:40] tabernacle like i told you the
[1:32:42] tabernacle was framed
[1:32:44] with wood that was overlaid with gold so
[1:32:47] when they put the first curtain you have
[1:32:49] to enter inside to see it from the
[1:32:52] inside
[1:32:53] anybody care and that curtain was made
[1:32:56] of fine linen
[1:32:57] blue
[1:32:58] purple scarlet now we are dealing with
[1:33:01] the caribbeans
[1:33:04] anybody okay
[1:33:06] so
[1:33:08] the first time they put this curtain on
[1:33:10] the tabernacle
[1:33:13] if you look
[1:33:14] you say oh that's a beautiful curtain
[1:33:18] when you look where they ask you a
[1:33:20] question what do you see you say i see a
[1:33:23] blue color
[1:33:25] i see a scarlet color i see a purple
[1:33:28] color
[1:33:29] but i see some creatures there
[1:33:33] what are those creatures doing there
[1:33:36] anybody okay
[1:33:37] anybody okay
[1:33:38] so when they put
[1:33:40] the other curtain all over the
[1:33:42] tabernacle this curtain disappear
[1:33:46] from the outside view
[1:33:48] the only way you can see that curtain
[1:33:51] you have to enter into the tabernacle
[1:33:53] brother branham says this that god has
[1:33:56] made it so wonderful
[1:33:58] that in the old testament
[1:34:01] he
[1:34:02] were usually i go to for refuge for a
[1:34:05] text once in a while
[1:34:07] he's made the old testament in parable
[1:34:11] and in symbolic form
[1:34:13] to express himself
[1:34:16] and his doings that the simple-minded
[1:34:20] might be able to have a conception of
[1:34:23] his will on what he's doing god has a
[1:34:27] will
[1:34:28] he want to do something
[1:34:30] but god made the old testament so that a
[1:34:33] simple man can look through the old
[1:34:36] testament and begin to understand how
[1:34:38] god operated
[1:34:41] brother branham said in the old
[1:34:43] testament being a top of the new the
[1:34:46] works
[1:34:49] of the inward cuts
[1:34:51] of the tabernacle
[1:34:54] so when you go in the tabernacle
[1:34:57] you see the tub and alcohol the
[1:34:59] tabernacle have three places
[1:35:02] one two and three and brother branham is
[1:35:05] saying
[1:35:06] that their works
[1:35:08] are the action
[1:35:09] because works is faith expression
[1:35:12] everybody
[1:35:13] the works that you see the priests doing
[1:35:16] in the tabernacle
[1:35:18] have a message
[1:35:22] so when your priest entering the
[1:35:24] tabernacle there is something he was
[1:35:26] doing here there is something he was
[1:35:28] doing there there was something they
[1:35:30] were doing there and brother branham
[1:35:32] said their works the actions
[1:35:35] of the priest
[1:35:36] had a message
[1:35:39] brother branham said the inward cult of
[1:35:42] the tabernacle was a beautiful picture
[1:35:45] of god's plan of water
[1:35:48] so when you look at what the priests
[1:35:51] were doing here
[1:35:52] he was talking about the plan of god
[1:35:58] amen
[1:35:59] to save
[1:36:02] mankind
[1:36:08] so when the priest bring
[1:36:11] a lamb
[1:36:12] and he's entering with a lamb the priest
[1:36:15] was telling israel something
[1:36:19] israel didn't understand it
[1:36:21] anybody clear
[1:36:23] brother branham say if we can only learn
[1:36:27] that's why we're learning
[1:36:29] by this now
[1:36:30] and how to get ourselves in the
[1:36:33] condition to receive what god has in
[1:36:36] store for us it shall just sweep the
[1:36:39] whole valley here
[1:36:42] my people suffer
[1:36:44] for lack of knowledge everybody here so
[1:36:46] far so when you enter into this
[1:36:49] tabernacle
[1:36:51] you look
[1:36:52] you don't see that curtain if somebody
[1:36:55] tells you there is a curtain that is
[1:36:57] blue scarlet purple you can look around
[1:36:59] you won't see it
[1:37:00] the only way you can see that curtain is
[1:37:03] you got to go inside the tabernacle when
[1:37:06] you enter the tabernacle
[1:37:08] like i said you look right here gold
[1:37:12] you look right here gold
[1:37:14] you look right there gold
[1:37:16] the only way you must look up
[1:37:23] are we okay
[1:37:24] i'm still going with the airplane like
[1:37:26] this
[1:37:26] anybody okay
[1:37:28] so when you look up
[1:37:30] you will see a blue color you will see a
[1:37:33] scarlet column you will see a purple
[1:37:35] color but there is a creature that look
[1:37:37] at you
[1:37:38] [Music]
[1:37:43] why a creature
[1:37:45] that creature is called a caribbean
[1:37:49] anybody okay
[1:37:51] let's handle it
[1:37:52] in genesis chapter 3
[1:37:55] that's the first time
[1:37:57] the word caribbean appear in the
[1:38:00] scripture
[1:38:03] everybody okay
[1:38:05] hallelujah
[1:38:06] brother the bible say and the lord god
[1:38:09] say

[1:38:23] and now lest he put forth his hand
[1:38:27] and take also of the tree of life and
[1:38:30] eat and leave water

[1:38:42] earth
[1:38:44] everybody okay

[1:38:59] and in eden here that's where god
[1:39:02] created man
[1:39:04] everybody okay
[1:39:06] then on the east side of eden
[1:39:09] god planted a garden

[1:39:18] then inside that garden on the east side
[1:39:22] of that garden

[1:39:55] and the garden of eden was the horniest
[1:40:01] because in the garden of eden that's
[1:40:03] where god was coming all the night
[1:40:06] god was not coming here god was not

[1:45:50] so this other code here was planned with
[1:45:54] polygamy
[1:45:56] and science here
[1:46:00] education
[1:46:03] everybody okay
[1:46:05] the second layer in eden people remain a
[1:46:08] little spiritual
[1:46:10] but man was kicked out from the garden
[1:46:13] of eden which was the holy place
[1:46:16] where man was meeting god
[1:46:19] and when he was kicked
[1:46:21] as a holy person
[1:46:23] god brought soldiers
[1:46:32] so
[1:46:32] he drove out man
[1:46:35] and he placed at the east
[1:46:38] of the garden there is a problem there
[1:46:41] that's where the altar was
[1:46:43] at the east of the garden of eden water
[1:46:47] and the water
[1:46:49] which turned where
[1:46:51] to keep the water
[1:46:53] the tree of water so in the garden of
[1:46:56] eden there was life
[1:47:02] how may i enter into life good master
[1:47:06] life was there the tree of life was
[1:47:09] there
[1:47:10] men have access to that tree of life but
[1:47:14] when men sin
[1:47:16] god moved men out
[1:47:18] and back here and he put carry them
[1:47:22] back here so when you want to go get
[1:47:25] eternal life
[1:47:26] when you look
[1:47:28] you see a caribbean's
[1:47:29] he's looking at you
[1:47:31] like don't get here
[1:47:36] everybody okay
[1:47:38] he put kerry beams
[1:47:40] and a sword
[1:47:46] he put carry beams
[1:47:48] and a sword how many caribbeans
[1:47:54] you will see the jehovah's witness i
[1:47:56] don't know who who put two caribbeans
[1:47:58] there is a reason why they put two
[1:48:01] hallelujah when god told moses
[1:48:05] he said make the ark of the covenant
[1:48:08] and they begin to make the ark of the
[1:48:10] covenant god told them make two
[1:48:13] caribbeans
[1:48:16] and put the caribbeans upon the ark of
[1:48:19] the covenant
[1:48:21] that is in exodus 25 and thus have met
[1:48:24] two caribbeans of gold
[1:48:26] and beaten work shall that make them
[1:48:29] into end of the mercy seat
[1:48:32] why are we having four caribbeans but
[1:48:35] moses was told to put two
[1:48:40] at chapter 1 7 verse 44 the bible says
[1:48:44] our father had the tabernacle of water
[1:48:49] two or three witnesses
[1:48:52] let everybody be established
[1:48:55] in the wilderness as he appointed
[1:48:58] speaking unto moses that he should make
[1:49:00] it according to the faction he had seen
[1:49:02] in heaven
[1:49:04] so the tabernacle was only a testimony
[1:49:08] [Music]
[1:49:10] a witness
[1:49:12] that's why moses only put two caribbeans
[1:49:17] bad caribbeans are full
[1:49:23] amen oh my god
[1:49:25] brother branham
[1:49:27] so he drove out the men and placed at
[1:49:31] the east of the garden of eden
[1:49:33] caribbeans and a flying sword a sword a
[1:49:36] flaming sword which turns every way
[1:49:40] see the water
[1:49:42] there is only
[1:49:44] four ways you can go
[1:49:47] every way four ways that's why you need
[1:49:50] a profit
[1:49:51] east
[1:49:52] north
[1:49:53] west
[1:49:54] south these caribbeans had a flaming
[1:49:57] sword at the gate of the garden to keep
[1:50:01] the way
[1:50:03] of the tree of life because if man ever
[1:50:07] get a hold of the tree of life then he
[1:50:10] could leave hell
[1:50:11] so the first curtain of the tabernacle
[1:50:16] that curtain that have our redemption
[1:50:19] that curtain that has our adoption
[1:50:23] that curtain that have our holy spirit
[1:50:26] that curtain was blocked
[1:50:34] when you want to approach it he tells
[1:50:36] you the caribbeans are on this curtain
[1:50:44] and when you enter the tabernacle you
[1:50:46] look up you see caribbeans
[1:50:49] in other words the way up was blocked
[1:50:56] do you follow me
[1:50:57] that's why everybody who died in the old
[1:51:01] testament
[1:51:03] could not grow up
[1:51:07] everybody was going down to paradise
[1:51:11] abraham down
[1:51:13] job down
[1:51:15] david down solomon down mosey all of
[1:51:19] them that down
[1:51:21] why because the way up
[1:51:24] was blocked by caribbeans
[1:51:28] [Music]
[1:51:31] blessed be the name of the name
[1:51:34] in ezekiel 10
[1:51:36] the bible said in verse 14 and everyone
[1:51:39] had four faces
[1:51:41] the first face was the first of a
[1:51:44] caribbean which means an
[1:51:47] and the second verse was the face of a
[1:51:49] man
[1:51:50] and the third first was a lion and the
[1:51:53] fourth verse was a water
[1:51:56] it's in the book of revelation john saw
[1:51:58] the same thing
[1:51:59] verse 15 and the kerry beams
[1:52:03] will lift up this is the living water
[1:52:07] so the caribbeans have three names in
[1:52:10] the bible
[1:52:13] hallelujah
[1:52:15] they are called
[1:52:17] caribbeans
[1:52:21] they are also called a living creature
[1:52:25] and they are also called
[1:52:27] beasts
[1:52:30] the four caribbeans the four living
[1:52:32] creature or the four beasts
[1:52:35] everybody okay
[1:52:36] in verse 20 the bible says this is the
[1:52:40] living creature
[1:52:42] that are so under god
[1:52:44] the god of israel by the river of quebec
[1:52:47] and i knew that they were what
[1:52:50] so cherubims and living beings are the
[1:52:53] same
[1:52:54] that's the same thing that john saw in
[1:52:57] the island of patmos everybody okay so
[1:53:00] far
[1:53:01] what is wrong with these caribbeans
[1:53:04] brother branham say these caribbeans
[1:53:07] that john saw here
[1:53:09] must have been interested in keeping the
[1:53:12] tree of life
[1:53:13] so they must be interested in human
[1:53:16] beings
[1:53:17] or read genesis getting back to genesis
[1:53:20] again they kept the tree of life
[1:53:25] guarded
[1:53:26] the way
[1:53:28] of life
[1:53:29] the way
[1:53:30] of life
[1:53:32] why is the way jesus say i am the water
[1:53:42] everybody okay
[1:53:43] so the tree of life
[1:53:45] was a person
[1:53:49] everybody here
[1:53:51] everybody here and the caribbeans were
[1:53:54] blocking people
[1:53:56] to access that person
[1:54:00] that's why the rich young ruler
[1:54:02] leaves all the law that he could but he
[1:54:06] figured out
[1:54:07] i cannot get access to eternal life
[1:54:11] then he came he said good master how
[1:54:13] cannot get into the tree of life
[1:54:20] hallelujah
[1:54:21] hallelujah
[1:54:22] he said i am the one
[1:54:24] i am the bread that come down from
[1:54:27] heaven
[1:54:28] from god out of heaven if a man eats
[1:54:31] this bread he shall live what
[1:54:33] in other words i am the tree of life
[1:54:36] if somebody eat me that's it
[1:54:39] everybody okay
[1:54:40] now
[1:54:41] there is a way back to that tree of
[1:54:48] life the carribeans
[1:54:52] in the tabernacle were on the mercy seat
[1:54:56] which was the throne
[1:54:57] because when moses saw in heaven he saw
[1:55:00] god sitting on the throne and he saw
[1:55:03] four caribbeans guarding god
[1:55:06] so when the throne of god came in the
[1:55:09] tabernacle they have to put caribbeans
[1:55:12] to garden amen
[1:55:14] but god have three thrones
[1:55:17] [Music]
[1:55:19] brother branham
[1:55:21] i need more battery for tripoli
[1:55:24] the first throne was in heaven
[1:55:27] that's what moses saw
[1:55:29] the judgment seat
[1:55:31] the second throne was in christ
[1:55:37] everybody here that's why the rich young
[1:55:39] ruler could come to christ
[1:55:42] because he knew good master jesus said
[1:55:44] if you call me good master you know that
[1:55:47] i'm god
[1:55:49] you already understand that but good
[1:55:51] master how can i get to the tree of life
[1:55:55] everybody okay
[1:55:56] and the third john was in what
[1:56:01] hallelujah
[1:56:03] what is wrong with these caribbeans
[1:56:06] brother the bible says
[1:56:09] these caribbeans here were placed to
[1:56:12] block people from accessing the tree of
[1:56:16] life or accessing god in other words man
[1:56:20] that was sent out here when you want to
[1:56:22] go back again to the garden of eden the
[1:56:26] kerry beams are blocking you
[1:56:29] anybody care
[1:56:30] not only kerry beams but the caribbean's
[1:56:33] plus a sword
[1:56:37] and that sword have flame
[1:56:40] because it's judgment
[1:56:42] anybody here
[1:56:44] brother branham say anyhow
[1:56:47] when the angel
[1:56:49] begin to pull his flaming sword
[1:56:52] out
[1:56:53] to god this water
[1:56:56] the bible says there was an angel there
[1:57:01] the bible says there were caribbeans
[1:57:03] and a sword flaming and you would see
[1:57:06] people putting
[1:57:07] pictures of a sword flaming on its own
[1:57:11] brother branham said no
[1:57:13] there was an angel there
[1:57:18] where did brother branham get that
[1:57:21] in the message end time brother branham
[1:57:23] say
[1:57:25] i imagine they come to the east side of
[1:57:28] the gate
[1:57:29] and there is where the angel
[1:57:31] stood with this flaming sword
[1:57:35] grabbing the tree of life by the way
[1:57:38] he was guarding the people away from the
[1:57:41] tree of life
[1:57:44] brother brother is saying
[1:57:46] that the caribbeans were not alone
[1:57:52] okay
[1:57:52] we have four caribbeans and there was an
[1:57:56] angel there
[1:57:57] with a sword the bible only said sword
[1:58:01] but hide the angel
[1:58:06] brother branham what is happening
[1:58:09] in number 22
[1:58:11] the bible says about balaam that the
[1:58:14] earth saw the angel of the lord
[1:58:17] standing in the way
[1:58:19] and his water
[1:58:21] joining his hand
[1:58:27] this message
[1:58:29] is perfectly aligned with the bible
[1:58:36] everybody here
[1:58:37] in joshua 5 13 the bible said it came to
[1:58:42] pass when joshua was by jericho that he
[1:58:46] lift up his eyes and look and behold
[1:58:48] this to the man
[1:58:50] over against him with water
[1:58:54] brother branham said he was the peanut
[1:58:56] of fire that became a man
[1:59:04] hallelujah
[1:59:05] and he said but as the captain of the
[1:59:09] host of the lord i am now come and
[1:59:12] joshua fell on his face to the earth and
[1:59:16] did what
[1:59:18] so this angel is who

[1:59:33] and his sword was flaming
[1:59:38] hallelujah
[1:59:39] hallelujah
[1:59:41] and then
[1:59:42] he says what says my lord unto his
[1:59:45] servant and the captain of the lord of
[1:59:48] hosts
[1:59:48] lord source say unto joshua lose the

[2:07:05] between this veil
[2:07:06] and this curtain
[2:07:11] what is the difference
[2:07:15] zero everybody here so this veil
[2:07:19] is exactly
[2:07:22] like this curtain
[2:07:25] and this verb have also what
[2:07:29] meaning is what
[2:07:31] that's why nobody could enter the holy
[2:07:34] place
[2:07:35] the holiest
[2:07:38] so when you enter god put the caribbeans
[2:07:41] so when you see the caribbeans even if
[2:07:43] they preach for god he said
[2:07:46] kerry beams means
[2:07:47] don't get there
[2:07:48] when aaron comes
[2:07:51] aaron must make sure he have blood
[2:07:54] for his sin
[2:07:56] and he have to tremble
[2:07:58] because if you put your foot bad you're
[2:08:00] dead
[2:08:01] so aaron have to go slowly with the
[2:08:04] blood for himself and for the people and
[2:08:07] they put
[2:08:08] a bell on aaron so that if something
[2:08:12] happened and he died inside there
[2:08:15] nobody got to pick him up
[2:08:19] because they were putting ropes on the
[2:08:21] high priest when he's entering if he
[2:08:24] dies there you don't get there you pull
[2:08:26] him you pull his body
[2:08:28] from the rope and you get him off
[2:08:35] because of the caribbeans
[2:08:40] this veil
[2:08:42] is exactly so when you enter the
[2:08:44] tabernacle you look up
[2:08:47] and you look straight to you
[2:08:49] god block up
[2:08:51] and god block to the holy place
[2:08:54] that's the first veil
[2:08:57] job to exodus to verse 26
[2:09:01] now

[2:09:05] called the door

[2:20:50] that's very good that's still under the
[2:20:53] law

[2:21:01] it's something in you
[2:21:04] doing it for you
[2:21:05] the holy spirit in your water

[2:21:16] put your seat belt
[2:21:20] when you enter the gate
[2:21:23] we will deal with this gate
[2:21:25] because there is four doors
[2:21:27] that curtain when you lift up you have
[2:21:29] four doors
[2:21:30] and the second one you've lift up you
[2:21:32] have four things yes
[2:21:34] there is a reason why it's four four
[2:21:36] four
[2:21:36] anybody okay
[2:21:38] so even though
[2:21:40] you have never seen
[2:21:44] the east side of the tabernacle and see
[2:21:48] upstairs
[2:21:49] to see that veil
[2:21:51] the gate of the tabernacle looks like it
[2:21:56] you okay now
[2:22:00] if you see the gate you already see the
[2:22:02] veil
[2:22:05] if you see the door you already seen
[2:22:08] that there
[2:22:09] if you see this there you already seen
[2:22:12] that veil
[2:22:17] what is this what is this what is this
[2:22:19] anybody okay
[2:22:21] now
[2:22:22] when you enter into here into the gate
[2:22:25] the first things it's a brazen altar
[2:22:29] brass means judgment
[2:22:32] that don't there he will come with your
[2:22:35] sheep
[2:22:36] because the sheep represent you
[2:22:38] you are the one that they need to kill
[2:22:40] by god
[2:22:41] anybody okay
[2:22:42] but god gives you a substitute because
[2:22:45] when god told i told abraham go kill
[2:22:48] isaac isaac should be killed god said
[2:22:51] don't touch it get a beast in other
[2:22:53] words i'm replacing something for you to
[2:22:56] use the perfect isaac is coming down the
[2:22:58] road you can kill him not this one
[2:23:01] anybody okay so you bring the animal
[2:23:05] and you're gonna prey on the animal
[2:23:08] you follow me
[2:23:10] your adultery leave you
[2:23:12] and enter the animal you're lying leave
[2:23:15] you and enter your animal everything
[2:23:17] that you did wrong
[2:23:18] enter an animal and that lab must be
[2:23:21] perfect
[2:23:22] everything bad goes into the animal so
[2:23:25] the animal innocent become guilty
[2:23:27] because of you
[2:23:29] and the you bring that animal
[2:23:32] and you put him on the altar and you put
[2:23:34] your hand there
[2:23:36] anybody okay so the priest bring the
[2:23:38] knife
[2:23:40] and begin to cut the throat of the
[2:23:42] animal so when the animal is trembling
[2:23:46] is
[2:23:46] speaking a different language
[2:23:51] because there was also a man who was
[2:23:54] dying at the cross and he began to speak
[2:23:56] in tongues
[2:24:04] it's a different language
[2:24:06] because the lamb have to speak a
[2:24:08] different language that you don't
[2:24:10] understand
[2:24:14] this message
[2:24:16] this message my friend
[2:24:18] is something else
[2:24:20] so when you cut the lamb the lamb is
[2:24:22] speaking in tongues
[2:24:24] you don't understand it
[2:24:26] everybody okay the lamb is trembling
[2:24:30] blood is going all over
[2:24:32] everybody
[2:24:33] the lamb is killed in your place

[2:24:52] grace and perfection
[2:24:54] he was in that altar
[2:24:58] everybody okay
[2:24:59] so that president there represented your
[2:25:03] cross
[2:25:09] everybody okay
[2:25:11] the next that follow
[2:25:13] was
[2:25:15] the level
[2:25:16] the level was where you take and you
[2:25:19] take the whole animal
[2:25:21] and you do what you dump it into the
[2:25:24] water
[2:25:29] are we okay did that know somebody
[2:25:31] your baptism follow
[2:25:36] okay
[2:25:37] the entrance in the tabernacle was a
[2:25:40] message for god how to save men
[2:25:44] so when you enter into the tabernacle
[2:25:46] the brass and altar is looking at you
[2:25:50] when you cross the brass and alter then
[2:25:53] you got to get in the water

[2:30:17] the same thing
[2:30:18] ever here nobody knows
[2:30:20] god say for me to see
[2:30:23] move to the level
[2:30:27] go baptized
[2:30:30] anybody okay
[2:30:32] when you get baptized
[2:30:34] brother branham is saying everything
[2:30:36] that you've done in the past
[2:30:39] is chop off
[2:30:40] it's taken off
[2:30:43] hold on
[2:30:46] the people suffering the message because
[2:30:48] of this
[2:30:49] anybody okay
[2:30:51] what is baptism
[2:30:53] the light filled you were unto even
[2:30:56] baptism does also now save us
[2:31:00] not the putting away of the filth of the
[2:31:03] flesh
[2:31:04] but the answer of a good conscience
[2:31:06] toward water
[2:31:09] paul is peter is saying here that when
[2:31:12] you baptize
[2:31:13] you are not cleaning your body
[2:31:18] the baptism
[2:31:20] when you are approaching god at the
[2:31:22] present altar
[2:31:24] you feel guilty
[2:31:26] because you are committing fornication
[2:31:29] you are living with a boyfriend for
[2:31:31] three years
[2:31:32] you have been lying you have been
[2:31:34] cheating you have been smoking you have
[2:31:36] been
[2:31:37] doing all kind of stuff so when you
[2:31:40] approach god there is like a guiltiness
[2:31:42] in you like you feel like you are
[2:31:44] unworthy
[2:31:46] follow me very carefully
[2:31:47] if you miss this what is following i'm
[2:31:50] soaring higher than this everybody okay
[2:31:52] so you feel like you're guilty in other
[2:31:55] words this is the feeling that when you
[2:31:57] come to the church the message church at
[2:32:00] first you feel like you're dirty
[2:32:02] you look at everybody the long sister
[2:32:04] long dresses and you feel like you're
[2:32:06] the one with a short dress or you're the
[2:32:09] one with a tight dress you feel like
[2:32:11] uh these people are holy i am guilty
[2:32:15] that's what you feel
[2:32:17] that's what when you're coming to the
[2:32:18] brazen altar about here so when god
[2:32:21] opened the gospel and the gospel struck
[2:32:24] you like peter in the day of pentecost
[2:32:27] something pricked your heart
[2:32:29] everybody
[2:32:30] then you repent
[2:32:33] you repent means you are truly sorry
[2:32:38] of what you've done
[2:32:40] and you are taking a decision to change
[2:32:44] everybody okay
[2:32:46] you cannot repent chewing gum
[2:32:54] in this church we don't chew gum in the
[2:32:56] church
[2:32:58] i seen two people doing it
[2:33:00] and the holy ghost just brought it here
[2:33:02] stop chewing gum in the church
[2:33:06] get your gum put it in your pocket when
[2:33:08] you leave here put your gum back in your
[2:33:10] mouth
[2:33:12] everybody

[2:33:16] there you don't use chewing gum to keep
[2:33:18] you awake in the church
[2:33:20] everybody okay

[2:36:30] for your sin

[2:36:35] because if you don't repent by the
[2:36:38] problem say what happened is your soul
[2:36:40] get tired
[2:36:42] of reminding you
[2:36:44] and your soul get quiet
[2:36:46] and let you alone
[2:36:48] oh
[2:36:49] if i was doing something wrong why am i
[2:36:51] prospering
[2:36:52] the lord gave me a new job they don't
[2:36:55] give me this
[2:36:56] prosperity is not a sign that god is
[2:37:00] with you
[2:37:01] musician in the world
[2:37:04] are you following me they are not paying
[2:37:06] that they're prospering
[2:37:12] musicians in the world they don't go to
[2:37:15] church they're prospering but there is a
[2:37:17] different kind of prosperity
[2:37:25] i'm adjusting my lenses everybody okay
[2:37:29] everybody okay if you don't the holy
[2:37:31] ghost left you and then when you
[2:37:33] continue it will wake you up when you
[2:37:35] want to die
[2:37:37] that's when you're going to wake up like
[2:37:39] i'm lost
[2:37:41] because you were playing games
[2:37:43] but if your repentance is genuine
[2:37:47] do you follow me

[2:37:51] out of you
[2:37:53] that unworthiness leave you
[2:37:56] anybody follow me

[2:38:02] toward god
[2:38:04] becomes clean
[2:38:05] do you follow me
[2:38:07] the answer to that clean conscience is
[2:38:11] what would take you to be baptized
[2:38:15] so when you are being baptized you are
[2:38:18] telling people that i have made peace
[2:38:20] with god
[2:38:22] in the altar my conscience is clean i
[2:38:26] made everything right the way i'm
[2:38:28] supposed to make right now me and god we
[2:38:31] don't have any problem
[2:38:35] i'm gonna stop somewhere because you
[2:38:37] need to go through this
[2:38:39] what am i trying to say
[2:38:41] when you go through that you follow me

[2:39:20] what adam done

[2:50:15] but it doesn't condemn you because the
[2:50:19] clean conscience keeps you religious
[2:50:23] why after we preach about the
[2:50:26] the water the what's good you happen
[2:50:29] with a split that is showing
[2:50:32] this what is wrong
[2:50:34] why is that split not getting away from
[2:50:36] you the black dog is fighting his
[2:50:39] territory
[2:50:41] and he doesn't want you to move further
[2:50:44] that's why you hit people i don't want
[2:50:45] to marry spiritual brothers
[2:50:48] that's fun get a bad brother
[2:50:53] get a man that is worldly
[2:50:55] the sex that you think
[2:50:57] it's only few
[2:50:58] a few days after marriage after one
[2:51:01] month
[2:51:02] you get used to one another you're gonna
[2:51:04] see the real deal i'm sorry i gotta talk
[2:51:07] plan
[2:51:08] do you follow me
[2:51:10] do you follow me you're gonna get used
[2:51:12] together you're gonna wish you have
[2:51:15] married somebody that have the holy
[2:51:16] ghost
[2:51:21] [Music]
[2:51:23] you don't know how many times i've seen
[2:51:26] married people crying
[2:51:28] you don't know
[2:51:29] you don't know what they put on facebook
[2:51:32] is fake
[2:51:33] what you see people hugging on me and my
[2:51:35] husband that's nothing
[2:51:41] are you following me
[2:51:42] that's not that's why you
[2:51:44] did they show you a spiritual
[2:51:47] man you will see your eyes he's going to
[2:51:49] it another one no no he's too he's too
[2:51:52] he's too strict there is something that
[2:51:54] doesn't want you to go there maybe
[2:51:57] that's the husband that's gonna break
[2:51:59] you and help you up and pull you toward
[2:52:02] god
[2:52:03] but the black dog
[2:52:06] when when when jesus approaches a demon
[2:52:09] the demon knew from another person that
[2:52:11] this is jesus christ
[2:52:13] that's why this get you away oh no no no
[2:52:16] that's a two strict man that's the place
[2:52:18] you need to go but this one
[2:52:21] the old nature is still there
[2:52:24] watch your behavior
[2:52:26] how do you give god
[2:52:28] the preeminence in your life
[2:52:30] how many times do when they say we're
[2:52:32] going to church what does it mean to you
[2:52:37] oh no it's sunday we need to go to
[2:52:39] church
[2:52:40] you're here
[2:52:43] you hear because david said when they
[2:52:46] tell me to go in the house of god i am
[2:52:48] what
[2:52:49] but when they wake you up you like
[2:52:54] the reason why you do uh
[2:52:57] because you're here
[2:52:59] and you become a denomination
[2:53:02] because it took longer
[2:53:04] and you never move from that state
[2:53:07] but here
[2:53:09] watch your friend
[2:53:13] how many christian friends do you have
[2:53:16] how can you be one message believer you
[2:53:19] have 10 friends and none of them are
[2:53:21] worldly
[2:53:24] because you're distinct here
[2:53:26] no no
[2:53:27] they're not bad people
[2:53:29] they're just clean people
[2:53:31] even better than some of the message
[2:53:33] believer
[2:53:34] [Music]
[2:53:37] he's a nice man he doesn't cast we just
[2:53:40] friend
[2:53:40] there is something here that draw you to
[2:53:43] that friend
[2:53:44] you can look at somebody singing with
[2:53:47] tight dresses
[2:53:49] and cutting pants like this you don't
[2:53:51] see anything wrong
[2:53:53] and you have enough gut to even post it
[2:53:56] so people can see because you taken up
[2:53:59] with the song
[2:54:00] but you don't see the outside
[2:54:03] the reason why you are blended to the
[2:54:05] outside is because you are here
[2:54:11] you don't believe in women wearing paint
[2:54:15] why do you post a woman wearing paint
[2:54:17] saying speaking about jesus christ
[2:54:20] the reason why you are blinded
[2:54:23] because you are right here
[2:54:29] what motivates you
[2:54:31] what touches you
[2:54:33] do you go the whole day and something
[2:54:36] struck you like i didn't read my bible
[2:54:39] oh you are reading off the bible is like
[2:54:42] you hit the ground
[2:54:43] oh there is a bible that i'm supposed to
[2:54:45] read
[2:54:46] or when you wake up something tells you
[2:54:48] read your bible
[2:54:50] where is that thing that people speak
[2:54:52] but i don't hear
[2:54:54] the reason why is your cosmos so
[2:54:56] everything that goes in the world in the
[2:54:59] politics in the drinking in the in the
[2:55:03] musician all the new words oh the drip
[2:55:06] that this you know you are all up to
[2:55:08] dated with all of that but your
[2:55:10] conscience is clean the reason because
[2:55:12] you want to go to university and look
[2:55:14] cool
[2:55:15] it is this this is this state here
[2:55:19] the one who's here

[2:55:39] tomorrow you find in church
[2:55:41] not even seeing the seriousness of their
[2:55:45] sex act that you have done there
[2:55:47] the reason why you're not guilty and you
[2:55:50] keep doing that years after years
[2:55:53] because you are still stuck right here

[2:57:04] light are you living under let me stop
[2:57:07] here

[2:57:17] movie the first time people kiss you

[2:57:24] breast the next movie they show a naked
[2:57:26] person oh no i'm married that's nothing
[2:57:28] to me there is something that is feeding
[2:57:30] you to movie all the time it is this
[2:57:33] state here because the old nature is
[2:57:35] still there
[2:57:43] let's bow ahead
[2:57:46] heavenly father
[2:57:49] lord we thank you
[2:57:51] for your grace for your love for your
[2:57:53] mercy father
[2:57:54] and for everything you have been doing
[2:57:56] for us
[2:57:57] father this is the hour of deliverance
[2:58:01] your children all over the message
[2:58:04] has been stuck for years
[2:58:08] and most
[2:58:09] are like the rich young ruler
[2:58:12] where the religion was a law
[2:58:15] they grew up in the home
[2:58:17] when they told them that you should
[2:58:19] dress with a long skirt
[2:58:21] they grew up in their home where they
[2:58:24] taught them
[2:58:25] how to talk
[2:58:27] how to dress
[2:58:28] but the nature
[2:58:30] have never been out
[2:58:32] they don't drink
[2:58:34] they don't smoke
[2:58:36] some never even touch marijuana
[2:58:39] some never even been in a nightclub
[2:58:41] they only watch it in a movie
[2:58:43] and father they don't even know which
[2:58:45] state they are
[2:58:47] and they think by staying too long they
[2:58:49] have the holy ghost
[2:58:51] and after a while
[2:58:53] they're going up and down
[2:58:55] and finally realizing like the rich
[2:58:57] young ruler
[2:58:59] that what
[2:59:00] lacquer yet
[2:59:03] after everything that i have done
[2:59:06] after all the youth meeting i have been
[2:59:08] after all the convention i have been
[2:59:11] after all the preacher i'm listening in
[2:59:13] the message
[2:59:15] after all the anointing i've i cried
[2:59:17] that's a jump i fell down on the floor
[2:59:20] still i'm not where i'm supposed to be
[2:59:24] still when i listen to brother branham
[2:59:26] it seems like i'm far away
[2:59:29] from what really this message is
[2:59:31] portraying people to be
[2:59:34] father
[2:59:35] i know the black dog is fighting back
[2:59:38] i know what kind of war i go through
[2:59:41] when i go through this kind of sermon
[2:59:44] father the people don't understand
[2:59:48] that it's out of love
[2:59:50] that we're going through all this kind
[2:59:52] of stuff
[2:59:53] some are caught up into a carnal mind
[2:59:57] they're looking at me as a man
[2:59:59] some are looking at me and saying he
[3:00:01] already got a lot of money
[3:00:03] that's why he's saying what he's saying
[3:00:05] some are looking and they say he doesn't
[3:00:07] understand what we're going through
[3:00:09] some are looking at us as oh we were
[3:00:12] together with him he used to be a deacon
[3:00:14] oh he's that old deacon that we have
[3:00:17] they don't understand
[3:00:20] further the transition that we're going
[3:00:21] through because the blood
[3:00:24] is sooner gonna leave the altar
[3:00:27] and father your children have been
[3:00:29] trapped for years
[3:00:30] under stubborn spirit
[3:00:33] how can you have a stubborn spirit
[3:00:37] towards your parents
[3:00:39] and still that clean conscience telling
[3:00:41] them they are right
[3:00:43] they have the holy ghost
[3:00:45] some are arrogant
[3:00:47] some don't see they don't want to listen
[3:00:49] to anybody
[3:00:50] their way
[3:00:51] is that way
[3:00:53] some are dominating for years
[3:00:56] until the holy spirit have no room to
[3:00:58] work
[3:00:59] but because of the cleanness of that
[3:01:02] conscience
[3:01:03] they don't have any guiltiness to
[3:01:05] realize what they're doing is wrong
[3:01:07] they can get in the midst of a
[3:01:09] congregation where everybody's dressed
[3:01:12] right they are the only one with split
[3:01:14] tail and they are calm
[3:01:16] they are the only one with high heel and
[3:01:18] they are calm they are the only one
[3:01:20] wearing makeup and they are calm and
[3:01:24] they are the only one
[3:01:25] having long nails and they are calm they
[3:01:28] are the only one having crazy haircut
[3:01:34] but their conscience is good it doesn't
[3:01:36] bother you
[3:01:38] and most of the time when you talk to
[3:01:39] them they say i didn't see anything bad
[3:01:41] on that
[3:01:42] i didn't see anything bad on that
[3:01:44] what is portraying what is pushing you
[3:01:46] where you are father
[3:01:49] it takes the holy spirit
[3:01:51] may you be merciful to this congregation
[3:01:55] may father you give them grace
[3:01:57] to understand that the place of
[3:01:59] justification is a deadly ground
[3:02:03] lord
[3:02:04] i commit everything unto the hand
[3:02:07] i have done what i can do
[3:02:09] but i know i have a great shepherd that
[3:02:12] is watching over the sheep lord may you
[3:02:14] give sufficient grace
[3:02:16] to help your children wake up
[3:02:19] wake up from the sleepiness to help the
[3:02:22] mothers
[3:02:23] wake up
[3:02:27] and don't put the responsibility on the
[3:02:29] preachers only
[3:02:31] to work each one of us
[3:02:32] to take responsibility of our families
[3:02:35] of our children
[3:02:37] of her husband of our wife of our holy
[3:02:41] daily devotion
[3:02:43] father to be right with you lord i thank
[3:02:46] you
[3:02:47] and commit them unto the hand may you
[3:02:49] work on this
[3:02:50] congregation and may you change them and
[3:02:53] bring them closer to you lord
[3:02:56] and father bring them into the holy of
[3:02:58] holies
[3:03:00] so that the message can no longer be a
[3:03:02] burden
[3:03:03] no longer be a religion but the message
[3:03:06] will be a life
[3:03:08] that they will be enjoying and no matter
[3:03:11] what is going outside the one that is in
[3:03:13] the innerval don't care because he's not
[3:03:16] even affected
[3:03:17] father we humbly ask it and we commit
[3:03:20] them unto the hand
