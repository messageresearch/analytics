[24:52] [Music]
[24:59] i just want to thank the lord teresa and
[25:01] i this morning we were in bible study
[25:03] and we got to talking about that vision
[25:04] that brother branham had beyond the
[25:06] curtain of time and how there was
[25:08] nothing there brother stephen but
[25:10] perfect love and i was telling her i
[25:12] said theresa we got to get rid of
[25:14] anything that does not respect perfect
[25:17] love in this life if there's going to be
[25:20] any change it's going to be now and it's
[25:22] got to be quick we've got to be like
[25:24] that little lady who lost a silver coin
[25:27] and if you see something that you're
[25:28] missing you better get desperate start
[25:31] sweeping the floor and throwing out all
[25:33] the trash and getting nothing but pure
[25:35] love in there because there ain't gonna
[25:37] be nothing but perfect love there
[25:39] and so we're sitting in the service
[25:41] tonight and that didn't sound like the
[25:43] tape we was listening to last week but
[25:45] whoever put the adoption number four on
[25:49] you were perfectly in the will of god
[25:51] because i played exactly the part that i
[25:54] was telling therese about this morning
[25:56] and brother was brother brandon was
[25:57] confirming there won't be anything but
[26:00] perfect love over there

[26:30] and you'll break to us again the bread
[26:32] of life lord jesus which will bring
[26:34] healing lord both to our bodies

[54:37] religious demons that's out there that
[54:39] got the people bound up and brother
[54:41] steve when you you'll see it was
[54:43] appropriate when you start saying a sign
[54:45] in assignments a commandment you'll see
[54:48] what the lord gave his eye i won't go
[54:50] the way that we went early this is just
[54:53] resting in my spirit so we better go
[54:55] under the leadership under the lord
[54:57] let's turn to the book of jonah
[55:03] and we thank you for your patience and
[55:05] standing here i'll tell you but we had a
[55:08] glorious time but uh
[55:10] sister when the lord anointed you to
[55:11] sing that song brother john just gave me
[55:13] strength huh
[55:15] hallelujah
[55:18] those who have jonah chapter 1 say amen
[55:22] amen and now the word of the lord came
[55:25] unto jonah the son of amitaya
[55:28] saying
[55:29] arise go to nineveh that great city and
[55:33] cry against it for the wickedness has
[55:35] come upon upon me may the lord have a
[55:38] blessing to the reading of his word you
[55:40] may be seated
[55:42] you know we got the inspiration by the
[55:44] grace of god
[55:45] from um
[55:46] uh running from the presence of god but
[55:49] we're not going to go that way tonight a
[55:51] little topic that was put on our heart
[55:53] is
[55:54] responsibility cry out
[55:59] responsibility cry out
[56:02] you know we come here
[56:04] it is our here now
[56:06] everyone has a responsibility
[56:11] everyone that god has saw me saw you
[56:15] before the foundation of the world we
[56:18] all have a responsibility
[56:21] so you'll see why it wasn't just the
[56:24] pastor it was the lord now i see we
[56:27] always look for a confirmation we don't
[56:29] want to come just in your presence just
[56:32] to be coming
[56:34] so you know we're looking at our hair
[56:36] now and god
[56:37] sent the message in this hour for us
[56:41] so that we can be live a victorious life
[56:44] but you know everyone has a
[56:46] responsibility of a father has a
[56:49] responsibility
[56:51] a man you know in that responsibility
[56:54] when he take on a wife
[56:56] when he takes on a wife and then they
[56:59] have children and when they have their
[57:01] children now he's there raising a family
[57:04] is that right
[57:05] but he's following in the order of the
[57:07] lord he said be fruitful and multiply is
[57:10] that right so god has given every one of
[57:13] us a responsibility
[57:16] and that man ahead of that household
[57:18] he's ready he's training his child up
[57:20] and where they should go when they grow
[57:22] old they won't depart from it is that
[57:24] right
[57:25] you will not have any problems there
[57:28] between father and mother and the
[57:29] children if the head of the household is
[57:32] leading his wife and his children
[57:35] according to the way of the lord
[57:38] okay so it's going to be is no excuse
[57:40] for this generation is that right so the
[57:44] wife has a responsibility
[57:47] and the responsibility that the wife she
[57:49] has she has there is to train those
[57:52] children she's there to be a wife and a
[57:55] good mother to a wife to the husband and
[57:58] the mother to the children is that right
[58:00] and not only that the lord say that the
[58:03] wife that mother is the fifth gospel is
[58:06] that right so she's that fifth gospel
[58:08] she's not just what letter only is that
[58:11] right
[58:12] she has uh
[58:13] her gospel is being ministered through
[58:16] her life and not only through her life
[58:18] she can do what she can pray for her
[58:20] children she can lay hands on her
[58:22] children she can move against the devil
[58:25] she can speak the word with authority
[58:27] when it's necessary is that right we're
[58:30] talking about everyone has a
[58:32] responsibility
[58:34] the hour is late saints and by the hour
[58:37] being late we're in a war and in his
[58:40] ward and sin we're in a real war
[58:42] but you know in this war the enemy has
[58:45] been coming in like a flood is that
[58:47] right but the lord said i will lift up
[58:50] the standard is that right he cannot
[58:53] lift up the standard unless you speak a
[58:56] word is that right god told us you must
[58:59] speak it right and for him to move you
[59:02] got to speak at them you can't look at
[59:05] your condition and not look at the
[59:07] promises of god is that right we have a
[59:11] responsibility
[59:13] cry out against this generation
[59:16] god has called us to let them know that
[59:19] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[59:23] and forever we has a resurrected christ
[59:27] and that resurrected christ he's not
[59:29] dead but he's alive is that right
[59:32] god came down he was pleased when you
[59:35] sing the songs of zion she sang the song
[59:39] heroin crisis won he came down she was
[59:42] pleased she was singing to her lord is
[59:45] that right and god anointed her broke
[59:48] some yokes off the people everyone has a
[59:51] responsibility
[59:53] the musicians you have a responsibility
[59:58] where you come you come early you get

[1:00:03] anointed and you recognize god will

[1:00:15] the lord of lord the prince of peace the
[1:00:18] almighty god

[1:00:23] when you're singing is breaking those
[1:00:25] yokes under the anointing the first sin

[1:23:20] wife no man you didn't put her in place

[1:23:55] got over there you know they had the
[1:23:56] lion brother sam and that lioness and
[1:23:59] when they got over there the lions uh
[1:24:02] got there and uh they were hunting oh
[1:24:04] boy boy was rough to bring down so that
[1:24:07] sort of the male lions don't grew up
[1:24:10] and they grew up and they had to hunt
[1:24:13] so when they got out there they ran
[1:24:14] across a ball and they couldn't get that
[1:24:16] bull down they couldn't bring that ball
[1:24:18] down
[1:24:19] so when they got over there
[1:24:21] mama uh mama had to go get the bulls she
[1:24:24] went they got the bull and got on the
[1:24:26] juggler they ain't killed the bull and
[1:24:28] they ran over there and ate
[1:24:30] and after that last time mama killed
[1:24:33] something for me here come daddy
[1:24:37] get out of here go get your own food
[1:24:39] ella just tried you gotta go from up
[1:24:42] under this roof
[1:24:46] how long are you going to stay under
[1:24:48] that roof
[1:24:50] when you're going to grow up
[1:24:55] lord have your way
[1:24:57] hallelujah anyhow
[1:25:02] adam knew
[1:25:03] he had that responsibility
[1:25:06] but soon as adam there when adam fell
[1:25:09] what happened god
[1:25:11] who's rich in mercy
[1:25:13] didn't forget
[1:25:15] he didn't forget him
[1:25:17] so we went and slew that land
[1:25:20] but the first thing adam ran to was
[1:25:22] religion
[1:25:25] see when they get over here they don't
[1:25:27] want this here
[1:25:28] brother branham said in the end time
[1:25:29] they're going to say it's too strict
[1:25:32] too hard
[1:25:33] that's what they're saying
[1:25:35] so they're not sure they're straddling
[1:25:37] the fence
[1:25:38] you know it's something good
[1:25:40] but you can't go anywhere anyway
[1:25:42] it's because god put a seed inside of
[1:25:44] you before the foundation of the world
[1:25:47] you were only sitting here because god
[1:25:49] drew you hand you were sons and
[1:25:51] daughters of the most high god
[1:25:55] adam
[1:25:57] hallelujah
[1:25:59] adam he got there
[1:26:01] help me lord he said now look
[1:26:05] this is uh around paragraph 78
[1:26:09] he said christie christianity is an
[1:26:11] everyday rugged life
[1:26:14] that's what he said brother sam
[1:26:18] it's an everyday
[1:26:20] it's an everyday rugged life living for
[1:26:22] god in this present world
[1:26:25] he said it's a constant burning of fire
[1:26:29] and love of god in the heart that sets
[1:26:32] you a fire and puts you out yonder with
[1:26:35] the people and making converts to christ
[1:26:39] responsibilities
[1:26:42] he said but it's easy to go the way
[1:26:44] of the world is easy to flow with the
[1:26:46] downstream see some people don't want to
[1:26:48] be talked about some people don't want
[1:26:50] to be put down well you know a living
[1:26:52] god is godly for christ you're going to
[1:26:54] have persecution
[1:26:55] he's going to come to you can't dodge it
[1:26:58] is that right so many saints want to
[1:27:00] dodge
[1:27:02] you can't die
[1:27:14] because of love love is what's driving
[1:27:16] you
[1:27:17] love is what's pushing you
[1:27:19] not the affiliated love the agape love
[1:27:22] that's what's pushing you that's what
[1:27:24] allows you to tolerate these things let
[1:27:26] me keep going he says go he says go out
[1:27:29] there and said
[1:27:30] he says when when things are flowing
[1:27:32] easy remember
[1:27:34] that going to a cataract down
[1:27:37] you're going towards the falls
[1:27:40] it won't be long you'll be going over
[1:27:42] that fall
[1:27:44] just floating with the world
[1:27:46] see
[1:27:47] remember you got a responsibility you
[1:27:50] wake up every day
[1:27:51] what god put you on his earth for what
[1:27:54] did god choose you for
[1:27:56] your call make sure you're calling and
[1:27:57] your election is sure
[1:27:59] know what god called you for he's called
[1:28:01] you for something he's called you to do
[1:28:04] the work you're part of this kingdom
[1:28:06] you're part of the kingdom of god god is
[1:28:09] now has given us a word he's opened up
[1:28:12] the whole bible to us we cannot fail
[1:28:16] jonah could not fail on that mission
[1:28:18] because god sent jonah on that mission
[1:28:22] god's chosen you
[1:28:24] he said look
[1:28:26] help me lord when he says now yeah he
[1:28:29] says judge floating with the world
[1:28:31] easy the way it goes you don't want that
[1:28:35] no sir
[1:28:36] but we must accept you must accept your
[1:28:40] responsibility
[1:28:42] he said no no this is from our prophet
[1:28:45] he says now you believe it
[1:28:48] you think it's the truth it's the truth
[1:28:51] he says and the responsibility
[1:28:54] he said that god has given us in this
[1:28:57] day to bring this message
[1:29:03] now you see why the devil's fighting so
[1:29:04] much up against it
[1:29:06] to bring this message and as i get and i
[1:29:10] know my days are shortening up i feel
[1:29:13] the responsibility
[1:29:15] greater than i ever felt before
[1:29:18] the pressure's on us like it's never
[1:29:21] been before saints
[1:29:23] god is showing us why because there's so
[1:29:25] much gross darkness on the land it's
[1:29:29] pressure coming on you you got to
[1:29:31] understand we know it's getting tougher
[1:29:33] to read your bible it didn't take to
[1:29:36] pray it's getting tough to do the things
[1:29:38] that you're supposed to do for the lord
[1:29:41] but we can say i look unto the hill to
[1:29:44] where my strength and my help come from
[1:29:48] the lord all you have to do is just
[1:29:51] start singing the song wait and say
[1:29:53] sister here comes the bride
[1:29:56] huh and god has said put a bride here on
[1:30:00] this earth that will not fail we are
[1:30:03] over achievers we are god has put trials
[1:30:06] and tests in front of us but he said we
[1:30:10] shall possess the gates of the enemy
[1:30:13] when after the trials is that right
[1:30:17] after the trial you have to be tried and
[1:30:20] tested you're not going to just cadillac
[1:30:22] out of here isn't that right no way
[1:30:26] hallelujah let me keep going
[1:30:29] you got to realize you're in the war

[1:30:35] got finished when he got there brother
[1:30:37] steve when he got in he was he was a
[1:30:40] great mighty warrior before he left here
[1:30:43] oh lord is that right you had to fight
[1:30:46] the good fight of faith
[1:30:48] but you have to realize god is able to
[1:30:51] raise these what stones up is that right
[1:30:54] we the seed of abraham he has raised
[1:30:57] these stones up he's raised up drug
[1:31:00] addicts he's raised up prostitutes he
[1:31:02] raised up the alcoholic he's raised up

[1:31:11] raised up lesbians he's raised up
[1:31:13] alcoholics he raised up drinkers he
[1:31:16] raised them up he's able to do it all
[1:31:19] you have to do is trust in the lord in
[1:31:22] all thy ways lean not to thy own
[1:31:24] understanding leave he will lead and
[1:31:27] guide and direct thy path acknowledge
[1:31:30] him in all thy ways
[1:31:34] it's all about jesus
[1:31:37] huh
[1:31:38] every knee shall bow every tongue shall
[1:31:41] confess
[1:31:44] earnestly contending we're contending
[1:31:47] for the faith that was once delivered
[1:31:50] unto the saints look what he said said
[1:31:52] help me lord
[1:31:54] he said now look
[1:31:56] i'm jumping back to paragraph 55 57
[1:32:00] then we'll look at some of these heroes
[1:32:03] you know responsibility
[1:32:06] he says being bought
[1:32:08] in the presence of god and seeing when
[1:32:10] god made a promise
[1:32:12] and god is obligated
[1:32:15] to that promise
[1:32:17] and when and when he brings that promise
[1:32:20] to pass
[1:32:21] then people are afraid to face up to the
[1:32:25] responsibility
[1:32:26] of coping with the message of the hour
[1:32:32] man
[1:32:36] they're gonna fight you every the devil
[1:32:38] gonna fight you every way he can for you
[1:32:41] not to get these mysteries that were
[1:32:43] promised to you
[1:32:48] some are falling away because some are
[1:32:51] dropping seeds on
[1:32:52] people huh you think the holy ghost
[1:32:55] don't know
[1:32:57] huh
[1:32:58] god is bringing us a plan
[1:33:00] the plan of redemption the holy spirit
[1:33:03] been saying now we're in the holiness of
[1:33:06] holy
[1:33:09] it's allowed me to go out and minister
[1:33:12] and show them the plan of redemption the
[1:33:15] tabernacle the fashion the design that
[1:33:18] was given to moses
[1:33:21] every age he showed us suddenly it was
[1:33:24] always a battle it was always a war he
[1:33:27] came in the false teaching but god
[1:33:30] always sent us a word to combat that
[1:33:34] false teaching in every age
[1:33:38] [Music]
[1:33:41] [Applause]
[1:33:42] we come in there first when you get
[1:33:44] there you have when we go to institution
[1:33:47] they say who have made a decision
[1:33:50] they didn't understand the decision
[1:33:52] but when god
[1:33:54] who rich in mercy
[1:33:56] would demonstrate to us ruth
[1:33:59] when he showed us ruth a true decision
[1:34:02] and we see how a true decision are
[1:34:05] designed in the scriptures not just
[1:34:08] accepting christ
[1:34:10] but the messenger of the hour came and
[1:34:12] told us
[1:34:14] that you accept jesus christ as your
[1:34:16] personal savior
[1:34:18] but you are not a christian yet you are
[1:34:21] a potential christian
[1:34:26] now when you go in among the religious
[1:34:28] demons and you sharing these kind of
[1:34:31] things with someone that wondered why
[1:34:34] they up they down and falling backwards
[1:34:37] in and out of the institution they back
[1:34:39] and forward because they never caught
[1:34:42] the true revelation of repentance
[1:34:47] a godless sorrow
[1:34:50] that brings a godly repentance
[1:34:52] that you will have to be repented of no
[1:34:55] more
[1:34:56] when god
[1:34:57] has bringing us those mysteries
[1:35:00] it's like a puzzle you got one piece
[1:35:02] missing
[1:35:08] and when they bring it to you
[1:35:10] and then you can fill it in guys fill in
[1:35:13] that gap that was missing out of
[1:35:15] someone's life about true repentance
[1:35:19] they don't want to be that way
[1:35:21] people don't want to be that way they
[1:35:23] don't want to be struggling with those
[1:35:25] things of the flesh
[1:35:27] but they need a word from the lord
[1:35:30] that's why they say a godless sorrow you
[1:35:33] can only have a godless sorrow when you
[1:35:35] get a word from the lord it got to be a
[1:35:38] revelation word from the lord
[1:35:43] god the truth corrects the error
[1:35:48] when you show them a true decision
[1:35:52] is a true repentance
[1:35:54] at the altar
[1:35:56] catching the revelation
[1:35:58] of calvary
[1:36:00] let the lord have been
[1:36:02] no longer under the leviticus law
[1:36:05] but we're under the melchizedek
[1:36:08] and god bring you grace and you can show
[1:36:11] them how to exodus 28 times you can show
[1:36:14] them the simplicity of the gospel it's
[1:36:17] not complicated now you can show them
[1:36:20] right there under the simplicity of the
[1:36:23] gospel you got to go first to the brazen
[1:36:26] old time when you get to the brazil note
[1:36:28] to what you got to truly repent first
[1:36:31] when you cry out you start telling
[1:36:34] people about the lord is about to come
[1:36:38] and they need their salvation
[1:36:40] you gotta have a word from the message
[1:36:43] of the hour to keep them
[1:36:50] so you have to realize now you can show
[1:36:52] that brazen old time that's where the
[1:36:55] sacrifice was made
[1:36:57] once you make it you make it once for
[1:36:59] all because now you got a true
[1:37:01] revelation of calvary at the cross at
[1:37:04] the cross where i first saw the light
[1:37:07] and the burdens of my heart rode away
[1:37:10] it was there by faith i received my
[1:37:13] sight now i'm happy all the day
[1:37:20] we move straight uh straight to earth
[1:37:23] straight into the world the labor is
[1:37:25] that right straight to the baptism come
[1:37:28] on now you can share these things with
[1:37:30] people you can help them show them the
[1:37:32] simplicity
[1:37:34] justification
[1:37:35] sanctification
[1:37:38] baptism of the holy ghost and now we are
[1:37:40] moving to the what the adoption
[1:37:44] once you catch the revelation of the
[1:37:46] adoption you know you are predestinated
[1:37:50] you know you come from god
[1:37:52] we should be the most happiest people on
[1:37:55] the earth
[1:37:57] [Music]
[1:37:59] that's why parker said death where's thy
[1:38:02] sting oh grave where's thy victory glory
[1:38:05] be to god is that right we're talking
[1:38:08] about a responsibility
[1:38:10] paul had his responsibility when it came
[1:38:13] iranis has his responsibility
[1:38:16] columbus had his responsibility
[1:38:19] martin has his responsibility
[1:38:21] luther had their responsibility but in
[1:38:24] each age why god showed us it came with
[1:38:27] the lion is that right when they're
[1:38:29] lying paul but god gave paul a message
[1:38:33] during the lions time is that right
[1:38:36] come on saint john you don't have to
[1:38:39] speak the word
[1:38:40] then he can move in when the enemy come
[1:38:43] in like a flood he understanding god can
[1:38:46] raise the standard to stand in the what
[1:38:48] the standing of the word that come out
[1:38:51] of your mouth
[1:38:56] speaking the truth in love
[1:39:01] then he came along
[1:39:02] when he came around luther's age
[1:39:05] he came in that age there with the ox is
[1:39:07] that right he had to have luther luther
[1:39:10] had the cane be pulled away from the
[1:39:12] catholic church the just shall live by
[1:39:14] faith is that right so what god is
[1:39:17] bringing us giving us the revelation
[1:39:20] of this plan of redemption you can show
[1:39:22] them by the scriptures how god defeated
[1:39:26] the enemy he had a remnant in every age
[1:39:29] that's why he's talking about the
[1:39:31] virgins
[1:39:32] is that right five lives five food it
[1:39:35] was really more than ten it was just a
[1:39:36] parable that's all it was when you go in
[1:39:39] there and you realize because it was
[1:39:41] virgins out of every age is that right
[1:39:44] and so he was gonna use that there so we
[1:39:46] have to come in his hour here now that's
[1:39:49] why the holy ghost went and we were
[1:39:51] showing them and we showed them today
[1:39:53] what the holy ghost brought sunday
[1:39:55] morning i was able to share with some
[1:39:58] men today and set them free and they
[1:40:00] accepted christ as their personal savior
[1:40:03] i said because look god you got to
[1:40:05] realize there's only one god not three
[1:40:08] gods i'm not afraid to tell them you
[1:40:11] keep you look at that trinity that's why
[1:40:14] you're muslim and that's why a jew he
[1:40:17] could twist your mind up he know that
[1:40:20] it's only one god you're not going to
[1:40:22] give them no three gods out but when i
[1:40:25] told them jesus said uh matthew 28 18 19
[1:40:29] go ye all the world preach the gospel in
[1:40:32] the name of the father son and holy
[1:40:35] ghost and then you can show them jesus
[1:40:37] is the father jesus is the son jesus was
[1:40:40] the holy ghost is that what we're
[1:40:42] talking about come on saint son then we
[1:40:45] show them is no promise there now we
[1:40:48] tell them you can grab information i'm
[1:40:50] not knocking hebrewing definition i'm
[1:40:53] not knocking arabic definition i'm not
[1:40:56] knocking those things but but
[1:40:58] information is not revelation
[1:41:01] information can lead to revelation but
[1:41:04] information is not revelation you need a
[1:41:07] prophet for your age to bring the
[1:41:09] revelation
[1:41:14] that's what i'm fighting against when i
[1:41:16] go out there but you know what god has
[1:41:19] given me the victory
[1:41:21] i'm standing for the message of the hour
[1:41:25] by his grace
[1:41:30] you go against him a muslim brother said
[1:41:33] who he said who is jesus
[1:41:37] who's jesus
[1:41:39] i say he's the son of god and he's god
[1:41:43] he said what you say i say he's the son
[1:41:45] of god and he's god
[1:41:48] he said who told you that
[1:41:50] i said god told me
[1:41:56] he walked away
[1:41:57] he said no more
[1:41:59] man now they got this thing on this see
[1:42:01] the younger generation when they go out
[1:42:03] there on the crew that's why i said

[1:43:26] i could tell you where i was at
[1:43:29] i said i was in the mind of god
[1:43:31] there's no religion older than
[1:43:34] christianity no religion
[1:43:37] [Music]
[1:43:50] deliberate i said okay
[1:43:53] what's the revelation of it
[1:43:56] i said deliverer
[1:43:58] salvation there's only one name upon
[1:44:00] heaven and earth a man could be saved by
[1:44:03] i said yeshua is jesus christ hallelujah
[1:44:10] that's what you're fighting against out
[1:44:12] there
[1:44:13] religion
[1:44:15] intellectual religion
[1:44:18] that's why they got a mess in the
[1:44:19] message
[1:44:23] because now god is unfolding it
[1:44:26] he's unfolding and bringing it to him
[1:44:28] they are responsibility
[1:44:30] i don't have that responsibility
[1:44:33] moses had a responsibility the
[1:44:35] responsibility that was given to moses
[1:44:38] son is that right and moses no they was
[1:44:41] in bondage for over 400 years but god
[1:44:45] said he was going to send a deliverance
[1:44:47] and a deliverer that he was going to
[1:44:49] send to and he said moses son and moses
[1:44:52] had to go but moses was like panasonic
[1:44:54] brother john that commercial slightly
[1:44:56] ahead of his time
[1:44:58] is that right
[1:44:59] god was going to use him but he got
[1:45:02] around in there and when he got there
[1:45:04] and he had to realize him so moses had
[1:45:06] to go to a strange land but moses had a
[1:45:09] responsibility he was going to bring
[1:45:12] god's people out is that right moses
[1:45:15] couldn't get out of his responsibility
[1:45:18] god told moses moses met the pillar of
[1:45:21] fire moses came before the burning bush
[1:45:24] moses had a responsibility
[1:45:27] moses was going to stand there on the
[1:45:29] word of god
[1:45:31] and moses went down there and when the
[1:45:33] anointing came on him is that right
[1:45:35] moses was against all sorcery moses was
[1:45:38] fighting against all witchcraft and we
[1:45:41] are fighting today younger generation
[1:45:43] third generation you're going to be
[1:45:46] powerful you're going to be tough you're
[1:45:48] not going to be able to be moved with

[1:45:53] be moved out of just to those children
[1:45:55] to be powerful keep the word in them
[1:45:58] third generation children rising up they
[1:46:01] have nothing in them but the word is
[1:46:03] that right nothing but the pure
[1:46:05] unadulterated word is coming out of
[1:46:12] moses

[1:54:23] you have to realize
[1:54:25] when joshua came
[1:54:27] look what he says
[1:54:28] lutheran let's bring it on up to our
[1:54:31] time
[1:54:32] luther
[1:54:33] we lose the
[1:54:35] he had a responsibility
[1:54:38] they wanted they had to move
[1:54:39] but the ones that didn't want to move to
[1:54:42] wesley and then they stayed there
[1:54:44] and then at the wesley they had
[1:54:46] pentecostal when the pentecostal lord
[1:54:48] showed shoulders not the pentecostal
[1:54:50] denomination not the pentecostal
[1:54:52] organization nobody moved us into that
[1:54:55] pentecostal experiences that's right and
[1:54:58] then that they came now it's the message
[1:55:00] of the hour and those that is in the
[1:55:02] message of the hour then they don't want
[1:55:04] to move now until the mystery to the
[1:55:06] seals and to the thunders to the ages is
[1:55:09] that right
[1:55:12] it's always been that way it's nothing
[1:55:14] nude it's up under the sun so now we
[1:55:17] have to understand we had a
[1:55:19] responsibility jesus had a
[1:55:21] responsibility when jesus came here on
[1:55:24] earth god said a child shall be born a
[1:55:26] son shall be given his name shall be
[1:55:28] called counselor the mighty god the
[1:55:30] prince of peace he had to fulfill the
[1:55:32] scriptures is that right it had been
[1:55:35] those in the old testament when they got
[1:55:37] there and jesus he went to the cross
[1:55:40] those old testament saints there was
[1:55:42] some righteous it was some wise they did
[1:55:45] present the sacrifices righteously they
[1:55:48] did present those things because jesus
[1:55:51] had to go to calvary and die and when he
[1:55:53] went down to the grave he had to
[1:55:55] resurrect those dead saints is that
[1:55:57] right old testament saints and so when
[1:56:00] we're talking about now in this hour
[1:56:02] here now we got a message and the
[1:56:04] message we are to tell them christ is
[1:56:06] soon to come and at the crisis soon to
[1:56:09] come we have to realize that only the
[1:56:12] thing is going to save them is the
[1:56:14] baptism of the holy ghost repent be
[1:56:17] baptized every one of you in the name of
[1:56:20] jesus christ for the remission of your
[1:56:22] sins and ye shall ye shall receive the
[1:56:25] gift of the holy ghost it's a promise
[1:56:27] unto you and your children and those
[1:56:29] that are called afar off we have to cry
[1:56:32] out saints we got the plan of redemption
[1:56:35] god has gave it to us he's brought it in
[1:56:37] every age we have to stand for this
[1:56:40] message the message of the hour that god
[1:56:42] has given up he said look here he says
[1:56:45] now
[1:56:47] he says what about you pentecostal that
[1:56:50] received the restoration of the gifts
[1:56:52] help me lord he said when the baptism of
[1:56:54] the holy ghost come out with speaking in
[1:56:56] tongues and gifts of the spirit coming
[1:56:59] back into the church he says why the
[1:57:01] method is wanting to kick you out and he
[1:57:03] says but you but you faced up to it it
[1:57:05] was something you had to do it's
[1:57:08] something we have to do in this hour

[2:20:17] into ungratefulness
[2:20:19] you're not even grateful of what the
[2:20:21] lord is doing for you
[2:20:26] until they ask you have you been in a

[2:20:31] all the time but they are happy you
[2:20:34] never been in a hospital for since

[2:20:52] problem will be solved but before that
[2:20:55] problem is solved the devil will add
[2:20:57] three mores
[2:20:58] and when that one is solved you can't
[2:21:00] have happiness because you are
[2:21:02] conditioning you in other words your
[2:21:04] happiness doesn't look at the
[2:21:07] circumstances you're going through

[2:26:50] 90 of people don't even know why they
[2:26:52] put courtship before marriage
[2:26:56] have you ever wondered why
[2:26:58] we call it courtship but what we do in
[2:27:00] courtship is not courtship
[2:27:03] we are under infatuation

[2:27:17] what you when you're getting married
[2:27:19] you're not really getting married you're
[2:27:21] actually getting into a
[2:27:23] courtship
[2:27:24] that's why you start the fight
[2:27:27] because you miss your courtship
[2:27:30] have you ever thought about it
[2:27:32] do you know what i'm saying
[2:27:34] [Music]
[2:27:36] they gave you why why does the bank have
[2:27:39] to spend so much time with the
[2:27:41] underwriter
[2:27:43] before they approve you alone
[2:27:47] because the bank doesn't want to play
[2:27:49] with their money
[2:27:51] they want to make sure they trace
[2:27:53] everything
[2:27:55] before the bank can send you a letter
[2:27:57] and say they approve you
[2:27:59] because the underwriter will pull stuff
[2:28:01] and then he comes back you say thank the
[2:28:03] lord the lord is done you you bought
[2:28:05] houses you know what i'm talking about
[2:28:08] before you know it you see him shooting
[2:28:10] an email he need this this this and then
[2:28:12] you get mad you say this underrated what
[2:28:14] does he want again he's doing his due
[2:28:17] diligence
[2:28:19] because the decision they're trying to
[2:28:21] get is a serious decision that's the
[2:28:23] reason why the answer android
[2:28:26] the underwriter is pulling a lot of
[2:28:28] string to make sure the bank is
[2:28:30] protected do you think marriage is a
[2:28:32] game
[2:28:38] continue to think let's pray heavenly
[2:28:40] father
[2:28:42] lord we are approaching you again humbly
[2:28:44] tonight
[2:28:45] father once again thanking you for your
[2:28:48] grace
[2:28:49] for your love your mercy and for
[2:28:51] everything you have been doing for us
[2:28:54] father
[2:28:56] you speaking so much in this church
[2:29:00] until you can go home and sit and see
[2:29:03] things that we didn't even catch while
[2:29:06] you were speaking because you unfolded
[2:29:09] your words so
[2:29:11] in a great way
[2:29:13] that it's almost overwhelming
[2:29:17] to realize that we
[2:29:19] unworthy people can be lord
[2:29:23] father exposed to such a great benefit
[2:29:26] in this end time
[2:29:28] father we thank you for it
[2:29:31] and tonight father you spoke about
[2:29:33] responsibility
[2:29:35] and responsibility goes everywhere
[2:29:38] he goes in every aspect of our lives
[2:29:41] he started from our home all the way to
[2:29:44] our jobs
[2:29:45] further everywhere even on the road we
[2:29:48] have a responsibility we gotta follow
[2:29:50] the traffic we gotta do all of this
[2:29:53] everything
[2:29:54] have responsibility
[2:29:56] father may you continue to minister to
[2:29:59] your children
[2:30:00] to give them revelation
[2:30:02] of what the responsibility is
[2:30:05] because when you send us here on earth
[2:30:08] there is a specific purpose that you
[2:30:10] send us
[2:30:11] and further you have programmers
[2:30:14] and kept us for the last age
[2:30:16] because you knew lord father what you
[2:30:18] put in us
[2:30:20] that is gonna be only developed under
[2:30:22] the message of the hour in the last day
[2:30:25] father may the holy spirit lord father
[2:30:28] drop again
[2:30:29] and shower that predestinated seed to
[2:30:32] unfold again more and more lord father
[2:30:35] the very purpose
[2:30:37] that you send us on earth because your
[2:30:40] prophet told us that your will in our
[2:30:42] life is a mystery and he said that each
[2:30:44] one should pray
[2:30:46] to know the will of god for their own
[2:30:48] life lord and once we know it clearly we
[2:30:51] can wrap our life around it lord and see
[2:30:54] everything moving just like moses when
[2:30:57] he went to egypt whatever was on his way
[2:31:00] he could knock everything out
[2:31:02] father because he knew that he was in
[2:31:05] his line of duty when joshua lord father
[2:31:08] went into the battle you didn't tell him
[2:31:10] that he will be speaking there to the
[2:31:12] sun and the moon but lord father because
[2:31:15] he went he was under his duty his call
[2:31:19] his calling lord and he fell under his
[2:31:22] responsibility when saul when lord
[2:31:25] trouble arose he didn't think twice an
[2:31:28] inspiration dropped quickly that could
[2:31:30] remove completely the trial because he
[2:31:33] was under his his responsibility father
[2:31:36] may we understand lord the importance of
[2:31:39] staying under our responsibility and
[2:31:42] wrapping our life together because our
[2:31:45] success in this life cannot be fulfilled
[2:31:48] if we are not connected to the purpose
[2:31:51] that you send us in this earth lord
[2:31:53] that's why lord father we don't want to
[2:31:55] waste time anymore spinning and going
[2:31:57] around the mountain left and right but
[2:32:00] father we want to stay center father put
[2:32:03] lord
[2:32:04] straighten our responsibility and lord
[2:32:07] father make our journey for the last
[2:32:09] push
[2:32:10] a lot to be easy lord because we have
[2:32:13] found the purpose lord father that you
[2:32:15] send us on this world in this world lord
[2:32:17] i pray that you protect your children
[2:32:19] and give them travel mercy and if that
[2:32:22] terror to come may you continue to
[2:32:24] consecrate us and to prepare us for the
[2:32:26] service on sunday we commit everything
[2:32:29] lord unto the hand and humbly ask it in
[2:32:32] the name of jesus christ
