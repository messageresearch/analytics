[47:06] church so spoken word I greet you I pass
[47:09] your greeting from Brother ch's lamb and
[47:11] brother Chad whenever you hear this
[47:13] you're going to hear a spoken word

[47:21] what so by God grace we will continue to
[47:25] work he thought he would make it the
[47:27] last time he was here but he was down in
[47:29] South Carolina and he had to take a
[47:31] flight so for him to drive all the way
[47:35] there to hear was a little bit difficult
[47:36] so one of these day you will see him
[47:39] here ministering for us amen a true
[47:42] friend and a deep teacher and a
[47:44] wonderful Minister uh I I told him when
[47:49] I met him I said where were you all this
[47:51] time I was in United States they never
[47:54] even heard about you but God knew the
[47:56] right time that we had to meet and when
[47:58] I sit down I listen I say my goodness
[48:02] praise God a wonderful Ministry amen so
[48:04] I believe everything is clear brother
[48:07] Kelly if I forgot something you tell me

[48:11] reading of our scripture you need to
[48:13] stay really in
[48:16] tune and uh I told brother Robert I
[48:19] don't know why how far we will go

[48:25] your Bible
[48:27] I believe you have a lot of time to
[48:29] sleep and to relax better than me my
[48:33] wife can tell you what time I went to
[48:35] bed so you should be on fire
[48:38] amen okay we finished yesterday with the
[48:44] prenup

[1:05:10] was his suffering he didn't he never
[1:05:11] done anything
[1:05:13] wrong so suffering doesn't mean you did
[1:05:16] something
[1:05:22] wrong sometime we do things wrong but
[1:05:25] some time you didn't do anything
[1:05:30] wrong but God want to show
[1:05:33] [Applause]
[1:05:36] something let's go to Luke 15 verse 11
[1:05:40] if you thereare you can say amen
[1:05:44] amen praise God the Bible says and he
[1:05:49] said a certain man had two sons
[1:05:57] ah this story is unbelievable two sons
[1:06:01] we got the Elder
[1:06:03] one and we got the
[1:06:06] younger
[1:06:08] amen the Elder is
[1:06:11] who or
[1:06:15] what according to the sons of Joseph the
[1:06:18] Elder is who Ephraim or Manas man man
[1:06:23] Manas
[1:06:25] where are you heading
[1:06:27] again chill out my
[1:06:30] friend this is the Gentile according to
[1:06:33] the sons of Joseph it is
[1:06:36] Ephraim amen amen glory to God he says
[1:06:41] and the younger one of them which is the
[1:06:44] Gentile said to his father father give
[1:06:48] me the portion of goods that falls to
[1:06:52] me and he refused
[1:06:57] what did he
[1:06:58] do why didn't he
[1:07:03] refuse because he knew what the son
[1:07:05] would
[1:07:07] do why didn't he say no no no no no no
[1:07:09] no no I know if I give it to you he you
[1:07:11] you will messed up the father look he
[1:07:14] said get
[1:07:16] it and the devil say get
[1:07:20] you amen he says and he divided to he's
[1:07:26] what how can you give a son something
[1:07:30] that you know he would go and
[1:07:34] Destroy because brother Bram says this
[1:07:36] brother Michael Deli he says and I can
[1:07:39] see this child now he's feeding
[1:07:43] Hogs here he's done in the pig pen
[1:07:47] slopping the Hogs and eating from the
[1:07:50] same slop backet feeding the Hogs think
[1:07:54] of it what he had left and what he had
[1:07:58] then that and the portion that he spent
[1:08:01] was really his fathers that he had
[1:08:06] earned but here he was in the pig pen
[1:08:10] and all all he could hear was a granting
[1:08:13] of H hogs in other words he was
[1:08:17] God's inheritance that we abused and
[1:08:21] destroyed and God knew that we would do
[1:08:24] it he knew that he's going to give us
[1:08:27] life and he knew that we going to take
[1:08:29] the body God will give us we will take
[1:08:32] the intelligence God will give us we
[1:08:35] will take the life God will I mean uh
[1:08:38] have given us and we will abuse it but
[1:08:42] despite that God gave it to us and
[1:08:45] sometime when you a sinner you don't
[1:08:47] even get
[1:08:54] sick why that William Marion Branham
[1:08:58] brother Branham says in Revelation
[1:09:01] chapter 5 God knowing that man will
[1:09:05] fall yet he could not make men
[1:09:09] fall God knowing man will be
[1:09:12] lost though he did not want anybody lost
[1:09:18] but to order that the great display of
[1:09:23] the attribute of God might be manifested
[1:09:26] to all men that he could be a what
[1:09:29] Redeemer he could be What A Savior man
[1:09:33] had to
[1:09:34] fall so your fall is
[1:09:40] important I know these are hard stuff to
[1:09:43] swallow so as long as my man can say
[1:09:45] Amen I'm okay amen you had to
[1:09:49] fall your fault was
[1:09:53] necessary your mistake was
[1:09:56] [Applause]
[1:10:01] important this is why some of the people
[1:10:04] that grew up not doing anything wrong
[1:10:06] God will shock you with
[1:10:09] something because you you you will begin
[1:10:12] to build a
[1:10:14] [Applause]
[1:10:15] self-righteousness so God will allow you
[1:10:18] to make a mistake and that bring
[1:10:20] guiltiness on you so you get humble
[1:10:24] [Applause]
[1:10:29] because I never done this I never done
[1:10:31] this I never done this I never done this
[1:10:33] in other word you saying there is
[1:10:34] nothing in you that you need to
[1:10:36] repent God say
[1:10:38] uh-uh uhuh that's not the way you work
[1:10:41] if there is nothing on you to repent the
[1:10:43] atonement doesn't have power the power
[1:10:47] of the atonement is when the atonement
[1:10:49] find you in a mess then they
[1:10:53] [Applause]
[1:10:57] I have a question uh brother Greg do you
[1:11:00] have a headache now if I give you taleno
[1:11:03] what do you need if you take taleno what
[1:11:06] will happen to you would you even
[1:11:09] understand the power of taleno because
[1:11:11] you don't have a headache but if you
[1:11:13] have a headache and I give you Talent
[1:11:16] now you will appreciate and have
[1:11:18] confidence in tal amen I don't know if
[1:11:22] that is okay now so the trial you go in
[1:11:25] your life amen he will make God display
[1:11:30] his
[1:11:31] power what the devil thought he's
[1:11:34] destroying it is now time for God to
[1:11:37] restore
[1:11:38] back and he will restore with something
[1:11:42] [Applause]
[1:11:48] better oh my god brother Bram
[1:11:52] say he was in him in man to do what then
[1:11:57] he was in God to do what redeem him
[1:12:01] again so God has a responsibility to
[1:12:03] redeem man and man has a responsibility
[1:12:06] to fall so do your fall and God will do
[1:12:09] his part
[1:12:12] amen I'm not preaching to you I'm
[1:12:14] preaching to the
[1:12:15] devil we did our
[1:12:19] part now it's God time to do his part in
[1:12:23] our life
[1:12:26] [Applause]
[1:12:29] you thought you were deceiving us you
[1:12:31] are not deceiving us you actually help
[1:12:34] us do our part so that the blame won't
[1:12:37] be on me but the blame will be on the
[1:12:41] devil even though I am the one who did
[1:12:44] [Applause]
[1:12:47] it is that a fair
[1:12:50] judge it is a fair judge because God
[1:12:54] judges according to his
[1:13:00] word praise God he says we have to have
[1:13:04] night time yes that's it to make what
[1:13:08] day right we have to have what sickness
[1:13:12] to make us enjoy what health everything
[1:13:16] a pro and a what a con so the pro and
[1:13:19] the C goes
[1:13:21] [Applause]
[1:13:24] together in other word if a c come in
[1:13:27] your life just be assured that as long
[1:13:30] as he came there must be a
[1:13:32] [Applause]
[1:13:35] pro are we together there is no trial
[1:13:39] that will happen on your life in your
[1:13:41] life that does have an attribute from
[1:13:44] God to supply that
[1:13:47] [Applause]
[1:13:49] trial I don't know if we together I
[1:13:52] don't know if we get whatever will come
[1:13:55] in your life just know there is already
[1:13:57] an answer for it he won't come if there
[1:14:00] is no answer because there is a cure
[1:14:03] medication that's why it's coming so
[1:14:06] when he comes just go back to God you
[1:14:08] say where is that
[1:14:09] [Applause]
[1:14:15] pill if it's a father says I am the god
[1:14:19] that supplier all your needs amen
[1:14:26] [Applause]
[1:14:32] are we together are we together when it
[1:14:35] happen don't be
[1:14:37] surprised don't be upset just say down
[1:14:41] you say no problem I know I know brother
[1:14:43] Stephen you don't know how hard it is
[1:14:44] God knows the harder one the harder the
[1:14:51] antibiotic the harder the trial the
[1:14:54] harder it means you are really
[1:14:58] [Applause]
[1:15:01] strong if you you you need to let me
[1:15:04] continue with the sermon so we can go if
[1:15:07] I'm dealing with a 5 years old
[1:15:11] amen how much strength do I need to
[1:15:14] punch
[1:15:14] him just a little bit so the strength of
[1:15:19] your trial tells you the level you are
[1:15:22] in your growth
[1:15:24] [Applause]
[1:15:25] [Music]
[1:15:29] because to knock an adult you need a
[1:15:31] really hard PCH so when the devil is
[1:15:34] punching hard it means that I am in a
[1:15:37] higher
[1:15:40] level wake up Church shut yourself you
[1:15:44] are somewhere with
[1:15:48] God this is not motivational speaking
[1:15:53] this is that the Lord
[1:16:03] [Applause]
[1:16:06] amen
[1:16:12] amen the two Thief were crucified
[1:16:16] because they were
[1:16:18] guilty the one who suffered the most was
[1:16:21] Jesus because Jesus was crucified not
[1:16:24] being guilty that's why brother Bram say
[1:16:27] what really killed Jesus was not the
[1:16:30] spear it was the
[1:16:33] grief so the punch of Jesus was greater
[1:16:37] because Jesus was the greatest sin on
[1:16:39] the cross
[1:16:44] right but when he did punch that was the
[1:16:47] greatest
[1:16:49] eror because he opened up the attribute
[1:16:52] he actually let the blood of the lamb to
[1:16:56] [Music]
[1:16:58] to the blood now was shed you can in
[1:17:03] other word it was good to keep the blood
[1:17:05] of Jesus in him if the devil was smart
[1:17:09] he should have keep the blood of Jesus
[1:17:11] in him he made a mistake and made a c
[1:17:14] now the blood is shed too late too late
[1:17:18] too late spoken word is Doom for Success
[1:17:22] amen
[1:17:29] are we
[1:17:31] together are we
[1:17:32] [Applause]
[1:17:38] together let's go to verse 13 because if
[1:17:41] I continue this way we won't we won't
[1:17:43] get to the
[1:17:45] subject let's go to verse 13 let's go my
[1:17:48] friend and not many days after the
[1:17:51] youngest son gather what all together
[1:17:54] and and took his journey into a what a
[1:17:57] far
[1:17:58] country Lord help me if I can reach this
[1:18:00] word far
[1:18:02] country amen far country and there
[1:18:07] wasted his substance with what righteous
[1:18:10] living he was no longer the father
[1:18:12] substance he BEC his
[1:18:14] substance amen Okay jump now to verse uh
[1:18:19] uh
[1:18:22] 17 and when he did what came to
[1:18:27] himself I might shock you but I don't
[1:18:29] have any
[1:18:32] choice the Bible say when he came to
[1:18:35] what his
[1:18:37] senses
[1:18:39] so everything that he
[1:18:45] [Applause]
[1:18:49] diden you
[1:18:51] guys spoken word spoken
[1:18:55] word spoken
[1:18:57] [Applause]
[1:18:58] [Laughter]
[1:19:01] word I'm giving you time to vent if you
[1:19:04] need a shout
[1:19:05] [Applause]
[1:19:11] shout do you have his record yes do you
[1:19:15] have his video yes do you have his first
[1:19:19] book account which prostitute women yes
[1:19:25] he was not
[1:19:27] [Applause]
[1:19:32] him I told you this will free
[1:19:35] [Applause]
[1:19:41] you we read the scripture over and over
[1:19:44] like almost 3 month we read the
[1:19:46] scripture over and over so who so who
[1:19:50] was doing those
[1:19:52] things hey answer me
[1:19:55] who was doing those
[1:19:58] [Applause]
[1:20:07] things in our in our
[1:20:11] fancy uh life
[1:20:13] way we believe that this candidate here
[1:20:17] that has been brought to our trial need
[1:20:20] to have a psychological test because he
[1:20:23] was not in the right mind when he
[1:20:26] perform everything so that his case can
[1:20:29] be
[1:20:37] dismissed he was sick he did it not in
[1:20:41] himself so how can you blame
[1:20:47] him why didn't you take him to the
[1:20:50] hospital because you didn't take him to
[1:20:52] the hospital that's why he did all the
[1:20:54] things he did now I'm talking like a
[1:20:57] lawyer why didn't you take him to the
[1:20:59] hospital if you knew he had a problem so
[1:21:02] how can you blame him in something he
[1:21:04] didn't know now that he got his right
[1:21:06] man give him a chance so we see if he's
[1:21:09] going to make a mistake again but he
[1:21:11] [Applause]
[1:21:19] won are we together are we
[1:21:22] together Hallelujah
[1:21:26] [Applause]
[1:21:30] so he came to
[1:21:37] what he came to
[1:21:40] himself amen meaning everything that he
[1:21:45] has
[1:21:47] done everything that he has done
[1:21:52] amen amen
[1:21:55] out of his
[1:21:59] mind because somebody lost his
[1:22:07] mind so if somebody lost their mind and
[1:22:10] he does something wrong do we blame the
[1:22:13] person or the sickness sickness so let's
[1:22:15] blame the
[1:22:18] sickness yes sir are we together yes sir
[1:22:21] are we together yes sir
[1:22:25] man
[1:22:26] lost man
[1:22:29] lost but I will give you a new name for
[1:22:32] this if I can reach where I'm going are
[1:22:35] we together now we clear now okay
[1:22:39] because when he came back to his mind he
[1:22:42] didn't even want to stay
[1:22:46] there when he came to his mind he didn't
[1:22:48] want to stay there he and and and he
[1:22:51] look he say wait a minute was that me
[1:22:53] who did this
[1:22:56] I was not supposed to be doing this as a
[1:22:59] son of my father this is not my
[1:23:03] behavior in other word the one that was
[1:23:06] doing that was uh Psalm 82
[1:23:10] ver7 now Psalm 82:6 woke up and said no
[1:23:15] no no no that was not
[1:23:16] [Music]
[1:23:19] me I'm not even
[1:23:21] worthy I mean to be doing things like
[1:23:24] this
[1:23:25] let me go back to father and let me
[1:23:28] repent and say father I'm
[1:23:33] sorry what a right
[1:23:36] man amen jump to verse 20 my
[1:23:45] friend I believe now we we are getting
[1:23:48] the picture Okay verse 20 and he
[1:23:53] arose why he was not he didn't ER rise
[1:23:56] all this time because he was not in the
[1:24:00] right the Holy Spirit just dropped
[1:24:02] something straight to me right now
[1:24:05] because maybe somebody is struggling so
[1:24:07] you who are who is struggling maybe here
[1:24:10] on online listen closely who here can
[1:24:13] eat food from the pig pen raise your
[1:24:17] hand now if somebody is eating food from
[1:24:21] the pig pen how is his mind I'm saying
[1:24:25] how is his
[1:24:26] mind so whoever was struggling you
[1:24:30] gaed he lost his man that's why he could
[1:24:33] even eat with the pig because his mind
[1:24:36] was no longer
[1:24:39] right but when he came to himself nobody
[1:24:44] pray for
[1:24:45] [Applause]
[1:24:48] him they coming back to himself begin to
[1:24:52] remove the pig pen
[1:24:55] begin to remove everything and begin to
[1:24:57] turn him toward the right
[1:24:59] [Applause]
[1:25:03] direction I don't know if we together
[1:25:06] coming back to himself break
[1:25:09] [Applause]
[1:25:10] demons he break every chle in other word
[1:25:14] the devil have so bind this boy until
[1:25:19] the devil said this one I got him he
[1:25:21] will never come out of this but as soon
[1:25:24] as he came to
[1:25:26] himself remember Samson one day was put
[1:25:29] with B but when the spirit of the Lord
[1:25:32] came Samson just did
[1:25:35] this and the Bible say they broke like
[1:25:38] they were burned or something so when
[1:25:40] you come to yourself when you recognize
[1:25:43] who you
[1:25:47] [Applause]
[1:25:51] are are we together he Shake therefore
[1:25:54] away from
[1:25:59] you because brother Bram say he was
[1:26:01] hearing the granting of the pigs maybe
[1:26:04] the pigs are looking they say oh we got
[1:26:06] a human being companion after a while
[1:26:09] the human being became human being and
[1:26:11] the pig remain in the Lower State
[1:26:15] remember devil enter Pig so the devil
[1:26:18] will remain lower but you can get back
[1:26:21] up again
[1:26:25] in other way you have a power to go down
[1:26:28] and to rise back up again but the devil
[1:26:31] cannot back up again they remain on the
[1:26:37] pig and when they want to go somewhere
[1:26:40] they ask Jesus Christ let's go into the
[1:26:46] pig I hope somebody's clear now we clear
[1:26:49] now okay where are we at thank you
[1:26:53] Lord jum to verse 20 and he arose and
[1:26:57] came to his
[1:26:59] father but when he was yet a what a
[1:27:03] great way off his father did what saw
[1:27:05] him so when the father sees him coming
[1:27:07] home he already spoke it's a message
[1:27:10] that's
[1:27:11] right there was no phone call there
[1:27:14] there was no letter that was going and
[1:27:16] say son you need to come home amen if
[1:27:19] the son is coming home seemingly by
[1:27:22] himself the father already know that
[1:27:24] something took
[1:27:26] place amen and then the father saw him a
[1:27:29] gray off and his father saw him and had
[1:27:34] compassion not anger and ran and fell on
[1:27:38] his neck and did what kissed
[1:27:41] him did he kiss a clean
[1:27:44] son
[1:27:47] no did he say wait a minute you are full
[1:27:49] of
[1:27:50] germs go take a bath first and shave
[1:27:55] yeah so the father for the joy lost also
[1:27:59] his
[1:28:00] [Applause]
[1:28:09] mind ah don't worry let's continue my
[1:28:13] friend where are we at verse 21 and the
[1:28:16] son said to him
[1:28:18] father I have sin against Heaven who
[1:28:20] taught him and in your sight and I'm no
[1:28:24] more worthy to be called your son but
[1:28:28] the father who is already seemingly out
[1:28:30] of
[1:28:32] himself because the other son was trying
[1:28:35] to bring the father back to his himself
[1:28:38] like you are acting like you don't know
[1:28:41] what happened sir you need to get back
[1:28:43] remember this is the criminal one and
[1:28:45] the father is still in another one in
[1:28:49] other word the attribute of a father was
[1:28:52] Quicken
[1:28:54] amen he was a father amen but when he
[1:28:59] saw his son that he thought was dead
[1:29:02] came back he open up a different level
[1:29:05] of
[1:29:06] [Applause]
[1:29:08] fatherhood the first father was you
[1:29:11] reward a child only when they do good
[1:29:15] but this type of attribute expresses
[1:29:18] love when something wrong has been done
[1:29:21] amen it's a highest typ of love a love
[1:29:25] that love your enemies and those that
[1:29:29] did things wrong toward you and you
[1:29:31] still respond
[1:29:33] [Applause]
[1:29:38] good Jesus thought the the people he say
[1:29:42] if you do good to those who do good to
[1:29:44] you even The Sinner do it so to make a
[1:29:47] difference between you and a sinner you
[1:29:49] would do good to somebody who did
[1:29:53] wrong it's the highest STP of
[1:29:56] [Applause]
[1:30:00] love when the brother of Joseph are
[1:30:02] coming Joseph said do not worry I'm not
[1:30:04] going to kill you God Did It for a
[1:30:10] [Applause]
[1:30:14] [Music]

[1:36:04] don't work with
[1:36:05] [Applause]
[1:36:12] you are we together remember last Sunday
[1:36:16] on the consecration of the priest the
[1:36:19] consecration was how many days it was
[1:36:22] seven days and each day what
[1:36:25] happen they have to kill a bullock a
[1:36:28] young
[1:36:29] Bullock every single
[1:36:34] day so the Bullock that was kill on
[1:36:36] Monday cannot be used on Tuesday the one
[1:36:39] that was pulled on Tuesday cannot be
[1:36:41] used on Wednesday but my time is the
[1:36:43] seven one so I must find the seven
[1:36:47] Bullock that have to be freshly killed
[1:36:51] where there is blood because eag suck on
[1:36:55] [Applause]
[1:36:58] blood I gave you that scripture before
[1:37:02] are we together are we together are we
[1:37:05] together are we
[1:37:07] together let me slow down right there
[1:37:10] jum to verse
[1:37:12] 29 and he answering said to his father
[1:37:15] Lo what many years this is the youngest
[1:37:20] son I serve you Nether transgress
[1:37:24] at any time your commandment and yet you
[1:37:27] never gave me a you know a kid is a goat
[1:37:31] so the younger brother I mean the older
[1:37:34] brother is
[1:37:36] claiming a kid based on his
[1:37:39] work
[1:37:42] right I don't know if you're getting me
[1:37:44] his work is righteousness it says
[1:37:48] righteousness by his work amen and he's
[1:37:51] claiming a kid amen but the younger one
[1:37:54] doesn't claim anything because he's
[1:37:56] Unworthy of anything his life looks
[1:38:00] messed up on any other angle compared to
[1:38:03] the oldest one but he's getting the
[1:38:07] [Applause]
[1:38:11] best spoken word help me my friend no
[1:38:14] matter how much a goat will grow it will
[1:38:18] never be the size of a cow
[1:38:22] [Applause]
[1:38:25] even if the go even if the goat have so
[1:38:28] many Long Horn that have already curve
[1:38:32] like this it will never reach the level
[1:38:35] of a
[1:38:36] [Applause]
[1:38:39] calf are we together are we together so
[1:38:43] no matter what's going to happen your
[1:38:44] level is so
[1:38:46] [Applause]
[1:38:51] high where are you going brother Steven
[1:38:54] with all of this where are you going
[1:38:56] where are you taking us
[1:39:00] amen last Sunday we found out that
[1:39:04] according to Exodus 40 I'm putting this
[1:39:07] you can take a screenshot or whatever we
[1:39:09] move on according to Exodus 40 we found
[1:39:12] out that the
[1:39:14] priesthood amen am was given to
[1:39:19] Aaron and to his son I'm trying to help
[1:39:22] somebody quickly so we go amen amen amen
[1:39:26] and then we found out that when it was
[1:39:29] time to consecrate the priesthood or the
[1:39:32] priest of the lord god require a certain
[1:39:37] offering for the SE offering of the
[1:39:41] priest now back up my friend okay and
[1:39:45] that offering was a young Bullock or a
[1:39:50] calf so we found out that a young
[1:39:54] bulock or a calf yes amen was a sin
[1:40:02] offering are we
[1:40:04] together a sin offering for the
[1:40:10] priest for the priesthood amen and this
[1:40:14] was in Exodus 29 keep that in mind amen
[1:40:21] are we clear there we found out that
[1:40:25] according to Leviticus 4 amen God made a
[1:40:31] difference between the priesthood and
[1:40:35] the congregation of Israel amen the
[1:40:39] priesthood every time they sin the
[1:40:43] offering must be a
[1:40:46] c are we together or a young bulock we
[1:40:51] together but when the congregation of
[1:40:55] Israel or the people of
[1:40:59] Israel the children of Israel all the
[1:41:05] congregation of Israel all the people of
[1:41:10] Israel when they sin the offering was a
[1:41:15] kid or a
[1:41:17] goat so God May set a difference between
[1:41:22] the line of the priest are we together
[1:41:26] and the line of the normal
[1:41:29] people are we together and this
[1:41:32] difference was so great until the priest
[1:41:36] or the L didn't have even a
[1:41:40] land let's go to number chapter
[1:41:44] one you need to keep your Bible I'm
[1:41:46] going to try to speed here let's go to
[1:41:49] number chapter 1 verse 45
[1:41:53] father help me let me see where we are
[1:41:56] we are very good my friend God amen amen
[1:42:00] okay number one if you dare you can say
[1:42:04] Amen verse 45 so where all those that
[1:42:09] were numbered of the children of who
[1:42:12] Israel by the house of
[1:42:15] what from 20 years old and upward all
[1:42:20] that were able to go forth to war in
[1:42:22] what Israel God told Moses number all
[1:42:27] the trouble and Moses begin ruing so
[1:42:30] many Judah so many isach so many and he
[1:42:34] number all of them even manasse Ephraim
[1:42:37] all of them but there was one tribe that
[1:42:40] was not touched follow me my friend
[1:42:43] verse 46 even all that were numbered
[1:42:46] were
[1:42:47] 600,000 and
[1:42:51] 3,550 and they live but after the tribe
[1:42:54] of their their father were not number
[1:42:58] among
[1:42:59] them so when they are talking about the
[1:43:01] congregation of Israel they will number
[1:43:05] everybody but God said do not number the
[1:43:08] that's right in other words there is a
[1:43:11] separation follow me between the leat
[1:43:14] and the rest of the congregation are we
[1:43:17] together verse 4 uh8 for the Lord has
[1:43:22] spoken to for Mo uh to Moses saying only
[1:43:26] you shall not number the tribe of who
[1:43:29] Levi Nei take of take the some of them
[1:43:34] among the children of what Israel so
[1:43:36] when you dealing with Israel Li was
[1:43:40] taken
[1:43:42] out Li was
[1:43:45] special are we together you can number
[1:43:49] Israel but don't number don't mingle
[1:43:52] Israel with leave Amen in other word do
[1:43:55] not mingle the priesthood with the rest
[1:43:57] of the congregation amen are we together
[1:44:00] yes are we together let's go to
[1:44:03] Deuteronomy Verse
[1:44:05] 18 Deuteronomy
[1:44:07] 18 Deuteronomy comes after
[1:44:11] Numbers Deuteronomy 18
[1:44:15] verse1 if you there you can say amen
[1:44:18] amen so God set a difference
[1:44:23] between the
[1:44:25] L where the iron and his priesthood are
[1:44:29] you remember last Sunday and the
[1:44:33] congregation amen if you seen you from a
[1:44:37] congregation go get a good if it's a
[1:44:41] l get a

[1:44:47] younger brother give me a
[1:44:50] goat the older brother give me my kid
[1:44:53] yes sir but when it's the younger
[1:44:56] brother who sins kill the FED Cal I hope
[1:44:59] we are getting together I don't know if
[1:45:01] you get what I just say somebody did it
[1:45:05] yes sir there was a difference in the
[1:45:08] offering when you see and you are under
[1:45:11] the priesthood your offering is a
[1:45:14] cal are we together when you see you are
[1:45:17] in the congregation of Israel your
[1:45:20] offering is a goat are we CLE now and we
[1:45:24] find out in the story of the prodal son
[1:45:27] when he's coming home the father say
[1:45:30] kill the
[1:45:31] calf but when the younger brother is put
[1:45:34] the elder brother is putting claims he's
[1:45:37] he's putting clim on a
[1:45:39] [Applause]
[1:45:40] goat and we know that the older brother
[1:45:43] is
[1:45:45] Israel and the younger brother is the
[1:45:49] Gentile are we together they go the go
[1:45:53] goes to Israel but the go is for the
[1:45:57] priesthood it's for the
[1:46:00] Gentile I hope we are getting
[1:46:03] together are we together in the back are
[1:46:06] we together are we
[1:46:10] together let's go to Deuteronomy 18
[1:46:13] these things you go slowly and as we
[1:46:16] enter in Demon are flying
[1:46:18] away
[1:46:20] am when you go home whatever was was in
[1:46:23] a home you will be find out they already
[1:46:25] flew a home you will feel a peace at
[1:46:27] home hallah like you feel like I need to
[1:46:31] sleep are we together Deuteronomy 18
[1:46:36] verse1 if you thereare you can say amen
[1:46:38] amen the priest The Who Levites so now
[1:46:41] we clear now right the priest The Who
[1:46:44] Levites so we talking about the
[1:46:46] priesthood and all the tribe of who Levi
[1:46:50] shall have no part this is God talking
[1:46:54] no inheritance with who
[1:46:57] Israel so if you go to Israel where is
[1:46:59] the land of deliver there is no land of
[1:47:01] deliver so God was hiding something
[1:47:06] there that there is a separation between
[1:47:09] the priesthood and the rest of Israel
[1:47:12] you cannot mix them
[1:47:14] together I hope we are okay now the
[1:47:18] Bible says they shall eat of the what
[1:47:24] offering of the Lord made by what in his
[1:47:28] what remember the fatted C when he was
[1:47:31] killed they have to eat it and only
[1:47:34] livei itat
[1:47:37] [Applause]
[1:47:40] sacrifices when you bring your sacrifice
[1:47:42] to the altar in Israel you let it there
[1:47:45] and you go it is the liver that kill it
[1:47:48] and they eat
[1:47:51] it nobody else can eat it only a
[1:47:54] l are we together when you kill a cal
[1:47:58] the L will eat
[1:48:01] it thank you my friend let me continue
[1:48:05] verse uh uh two therefore shall they the
[1:48:10] priest deliver have what no inheritance
[1:48:13] among the who Brethren the Lord is their
[1:48:20] inheritance if you look in and
[1:48:23] translation it means the Lord is their
[1:48:31] portion so the responsibility of
[1:48:35] the belongs in the hand of the
[1:48:38] Lord I don't know if you get
[1:48:41] it if you ask the Lord if you ask a
[1:48:44] where is where are your asset he said go
[1:48:48] ask God all the asset of deliver even
[1:48:53] the nourishment of the L even the
[1:48:56] restoration of the L were provided by
[1:49:00] God everybody else will work but the L
[1:49:04] don't
[1:49:06] [Applause]
[1:49:07] work the Liv work in the sanctuary amen
[1:49:12] and as they work that's the way they eat
[1:49:15] [Applause]
[1:49:20] amen leave don't need to have flocks you
[1:49:25] keep the flocks but you will bring it to
[1:49:28] [Applause]
[1:49:31] deliv so the portion of delivered is the
[1:49:35] Lord amen because one day pram
[1:49:40] stood and look at or
[1:49:42] [Applause]
[1:49:45] Rober and saw the big building of Ora
[1:49:48] robit and then he look at Billy Graham
[1:49:52] and saw the big building of Billy Graham
[1:49:55] he said Lord what have I done that you
[1:49:58] don't trust me with such a big things
[1:50:02] the Lord came down say William Bram I am

[2:03:11] [Music]
[2:03:13] calf I don't know if we together sir in
[2:03:17] other word the offering of sin of Aon

[2:03:37] we on
[2:03:39] 32 amen amen so there are three chapter
[2:03:43] in between my friend are we together God
[2:03:48] before Aaron did anything God said hey
[2:03:51] call Aon and his
[2:03:53] son call the priesthood call the lad
[2:03:57] call the
[2:03:59] Brad amen and make a sin offering for
[2:04:02] the
[2:04:03] Brad and the sin offering was given of a
[2:04:07] calf then later on in the life of Aon
[2:04:11] Aon make a mistake and the mistake he's
[2:04:15] making is a cal which is exactly the
[2:04:19] offering of sin that God gave before his
[2:04:24] [Applause]
[2:04:28] sin are we together are we together let
[2:04:32] me start it
[2:04:34] again school is
[2:04:36] on are we together in Exodus 29 Aaron
[2:04:41] didn't do anything
[2:04:43] wrong God say bring Aaron to consecrate
[2:04:46] him they brought Aon God say he need a
[2:04:49] sin offering which offering he said get
[2:04:52] a
[2:04:53] calf a calf what about a lamb a
[2:04:58] calf they brought a calf kill it for
[2:05:01] Aaron so Aaron is
[2:05:04] covered are we together then in the life
[2:05:08] of Aaron down the road Aaron make a
[2:05:13] mistake because of the pressure of the
[2:05:17] congregation are we together and his
[2:05:20] mistake came
[2:05:24] accidentally a
[2:05:26] calf so God s the
[2:05:30] calf before Aaron made the
[2:05:35] mistake I hope now you're getting it in
[2:05:38] other word the sacrifice of sin for
[2:05:40] Aaron was
[2:05:43] slain before the act of
[2:05:46] [Applause]
[2:05:49] SE now you begin to understand now you
[2:05:52] begin to understand so when Aaron is
[2:05:55] making a mistake he doesn't surprise God
[2:05:59] God say I already slew a car for AR in
[2:06:03] other word your
[2:06:06] sacrifice was slain the lamb was slain
[2:06:11] before the foundation of the world
[2:06:18] am so before you make any mistake God
[2:06:22] already slew your sacrifice so when you
[2:06:25] making a mistake the sacrif the
[2:06:28] atonement is already
[2:06:30] [Applause]
[2:06:33] sing I don't know if we together I don't
[2:06:36] know if we together why was their
[2:06:39] sacrifice a CF and when he make a
[2:06:41] mistake he brings a CF and a CF is what
[2:06:45] Aton his sin and a calf was for the sin
[2:06:48] offering and the sin of Aaron was a calf
[2:06:51] golden cast God atoned his sin before
[2:06:56] even he made
[2:06:58] [Applause]
[2:07:00] it that's why in so to he said remember
[2:07:05] ye God even though you going to fall
[2:07:08] like man but remember you are God
[2:07:11] because God already flew the sacrifice
[2:07:14] he knows the mistake you going to make
[2:07:17] but there is already an atonement that
[2:07:20] is flying and follow in your
[2:07:22] [Applause]
[2:07:28] life are we together are we together are
[2:07:32] we
[2:07:35] together have i l someone when we look
[2:07:39] at the
[2:07:40] ignorance amen we found out that Gentile
[2:07:44] were
[2:07:46] ignorant we didn't have God we read this
[2:07:50] last uh Sunday amen and the Bible say
[2:07:53] God
[2:07:55] winked God closed his
[2:07:58] eyes he doesn't want to see and he just
[2:08:02] suffer
[2:08:04] say just leave him alone am amen why is
[2:08:09] he linking is he winking we found out
[2:08:12] that later on the levitical priesthood
[2:08:14] was change and put into
[2:08:17] melkisedek because Christ was the end of
[2:08:20] the law follow me my friend Paul say in
[2:08:23] Galan he said but before Faith
[2:08:27] came amen we were kept under the law
[2:08:32] shut up unto the faith which should what
[2:08:35] afterwards be revealed so Faith was
[2:08:37] coming in the future wherefore the law
[2:08:40] was only
[2:08:42] what to bring us unto who that we might
[2:08:46] be justified by faith are we together
[2:08:50] but after after that faith is
[2:08:53] come we are no longer under a what a
[2:08:57] school master so when Jesus Christ came
[2:09:00] the law must be
[2:09:02] abolished because the priesthood now
[2:09:04] need to change from liver unto
[2:09:08] MEC that's why Jesus have to face the
[2:09:11] high
[2:09:17] priest are you together are we together
[2:09:21] are we together do you know what
[2:09:23] disqualified the priesthood of Li do you
[2:09:27] know what disqualify
[2:09:29] him do you know what he
[2:09:32] wasas asked Jesus Christ he said don't
[2:09:36] you hear everybody had they accusing you
[2:09:38] and Jesus was already sitting like
[2:09:41] this and CA say I commend you iure you
[2:09:47] by the Living God you need to answer
[2:09:49] when he say that he said tell us if you
[2:09:52] are the Son of God the Messiah it's
[2:09:55] written in your Bible but we know now
[2:09:57] what Son of God means because according
[2:10:00] to John 5 when Jesus say I'm a Son of
[2:10:04] God it means he was what equal with who
[2:10:08] so he asked Jesus Christ tell us if you
[2:10:11] are the Son of God if you are the
[2:10:14] Messiah if you are God as a human being
[2:10:19] tell us and Jesus say you said
[2:10:23] it in other words I am that God when he
[2:10:28] said that K took his
[2:10:30] clothes and T them down and it was a law
[2:10:35] in the levitical PRI that a high priest
[2:10:38] cannot tellar clo so before meis
[2:10:41] priesthood the levitical was completely
[2:10:45] disqualified and he was
[2:10:47] disqualified by the Revelation that God
[2:10:50] became a am
[2:10:52] men
[2:10:55] hallu Hallelujah and I believe we need
[2:10:58] to tell some levitical priesthood in
[2:11:02] this message and my way of telling is
[2:11:06] God told me I am God so you can tell
[2:11:11] your
[2:11:12] [Applause]
[2:11:17] clothing he start preaching the people
[2:11:19] that they are god of
[2:11:22] you say that I am what he said I am God
[2:11:26] if he going to tell your theology Let It
[2:11:30] [Applause]
[2:11:36] Be Moses under the blood of bulls and
[2:11:40] goat God told him you are God but me
[2:11:43] under the blood of the Lamb not the typ
[2:11:47] but the antip how can I doubt
[2:11:53] [Applause]
[2:11:56] are we together are we together are we
[2:11:59] together so the levitical priesthood
[2:12:02] gave away and the Mec took over and when
[2:12:05] he took
[2:12:07] over because we Gentile were far
[2:12:10] away the Paul say whereby that in the

[2:49:19] afternoon Lord thanking you for your
[2:49:22] grace for your love and your mercy and
[2:49:24] for helping us through this sermon
[2:49:27] because Lord we are very
[2:49:29] Unworthy of receiving all of this you
[2:49:33] only took Calvary so that we can be
[2:49:35] beneficiary of these things that's right
[2:49:38] Father I remember years that we were
[2:49:40] reading the Bible and not understanding
[2:49:42] anything we can read a story and don't
[2:49:44] know what we are reading and we wonder
[2:49:47] why is this calf this Bullock but today
[2:49:50] Father this Bible became a love book to
[2:49:54] us a book that when we can read we can
[2:49:57] see between the line and we can
[2:49:59] understand the Plan of Redemption of our
[2:50:02] life yes the
[2:50:05] sacrifice of the fatted calf for the
[2:50:08] younger child have to free him
[2:50:11] completely a sin offering that cut down
[2:50:15] idolatry a sin offering that remove
[2:50:18] everything that we did when we were
[2:50:21] blind a sin offering that pleaded for
[2:50:24] our ignorance
[2:50:27] Lord and bring us perfect in your sight
[2:50:30] Lord may you help the
[2:50:34] congregation and everyone streaming
[2:50:36] online and those that will stream to go
[2:50:39] home and to pray so that you will
[2:50:41] continue to unfold to them that before
[2:50:44] we made any mistake we can name on this
[2:50:47] Earth our sacrifice was already given
[2:50:51] our lamb was slain before even the
[2:50:54] foundation of the world thank you Father
[2:50:57] before you created this Earth that we
[2:50:59] living in you already slew the lamb
[2:51:02] knowing everything that we will do why
[2:51:05] would you slay the lamb when nobody have
[2:51:07] seen why would you give Aaron a
[2:51:10] sacrifice of a of a cal when he has not
[2:51:13] done the golden calf yet because you a
[2:51:16] God that have preemptive struck father
[2:51:19] you moveing before the enemy can see you
[2:51:22] declared the the end from the beginning
[2:51:25] you saw exactly what going to happen and
[2:51:27] that sacrifice that's why when we were
[2:51:30] yet
[2:51:31] sinner you even died for us Lord on
[2:51:34] Calvary when you died on Calvary many of
[2:51:37] us were not even born none of us that is
[2:51:40] here was born but that atonement is
[2:51:42] following us and when we make a mistake
[2:51:45] we find out that there was already an
[2:51:47] atonement that respond to the mistake we
[2:51:49] will make father may you free any guilty
[2:51:53] [Music]
[2:51:54] person so that they can be free to
[2:51:58] approach the throne of grace with
[2:52:00] boldness knowing that as long as they
[2:52:03] claiming on that sacrifice father you
[2:52:06] can never see them as a sinner and don't
[2:52:08] even remember what they did before Lord
