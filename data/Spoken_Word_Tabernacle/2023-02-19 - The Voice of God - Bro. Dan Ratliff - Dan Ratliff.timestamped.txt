[23:13] everything he has done for my family and
[23:15] myself
[23:16] on Thursday Lord's running go on sorry I
[23:21] had to drop off an order for someone
[23:25] so I was hustling to get it done
[23:28] as I got it done I thought I turned the
[23:30] stove off
[23:31] to me I love and entrepreneur there was
[23:34] no fire
[23:35] so I packed up everything and I rushed
[23:38] out and I came all the way up to
[23:39] Charlotte we had some other rungs to
[23:41] make
[23:42] and I did everything and on the way back
[23:45] home we were out for six hours
[23:48] when we got in normally I would go in
[23:51] first and when I go in I would always
[23:53] put the light on in the house
[23:55] Hadassah came in before me and that's
[23:58] something that don't happen
[24:00] and as she went in she turned around and
[24:02] she came running back out she said mom
[24:04] move move get back get back I said what
[24:07] is it she said get back so I just ran
[24:09] back together with her she said
[24:10] apparently I left the stove on and it's
[24:13] a gas stove she said and the entire
[24:15] house is smelling of gas
[24:17] so we came back out and
[24:20] I sort of opened the door to let the air
[24:24] out and standing there the whole yard is
[24:27] smelling of gas
[24:29] so we had a light on in the hallway
[24:33] there was a light on on the steps to
[24:36] come up from the the downstairs and the
[24:40] pilot light for the fireplace was on
[24:43] I called brother Robert I said Robert
[24:46] this is what happened
[24:47] the first question he asked was did the
[24:49] house blow up I said no he said did you
[24:52] and Hadassah get hurt I said no so I
[24:55] called Freeman gas which is a gas
[24:57] company that deals with the house he
[24:59] says Miss Valley
[25:00] stay outside but while I was speaking to
[25:03] Robert I said Lord you protect the house
[25:05] I believe you protect me I'm going to go
[25:07] in and open the doors to get the scent
[25:09] out
[25:10] and the Lord said to me hold your skirt
[25:13] so no static forms touching anything go
[25:16] in don't put any light out or any light
[25:19] on
[25:20] and you just opened the doors and come
[25:23] out the back door and move away from the
[25:25] house so we did that we reversed the car
[25:28] and put the car up by the grass closer
[25:31] to the road
[25:32] so I called Fremont gas he walked me
[25:35] through
[25:36] he said I'm going to take you to the
[25:37] main
[25:39] Outlet the big tank he said I'm I'll
[25:42] guide you to turn it off and you'll stay
[25:45] as far away from the house as possible
[25:48] so I said to him okay and we did that he
[25:50] said
[25:51] yes somebody somebody in your area and
[25:54] we're gonna send him over right away so
[25:57] in like in 20 minutes time he came he
[26:00] checked to make sure the tank was off he
[26:02] went in he says how long were you all
[26:04] going for us in six hours he said and
[26:07] these lights was on I said yes you said
[26:09] Andrew
[26:10] pilot lights on I said yes
[26:15] so I don't know what to say
[26:18] I just don't know what to say
[26:21] you know he checked everything he said
[26:23] it wasn't any leaps or nothing and
[26:26] Saints you know we heard of the couple
[26:27] and you know it was very sad the guy
[26:30] sneak and what happened to them and the
[26:33] Lord protected our own we they just
[26:36] filled a tank and the tank was at a
[26:38] hundred percent and 10 of the the tank
[26:43] escaped at that time the Lord kept the
[26:46] house the pilot light was on the light
[26:49] was on I just want to say
[27:03] I'm crying but it still tears of joy
[27:06] because when we realized how much God
[27:08] loves us and how much he protects us you
[27:12] know because it was six hours gas is on
[27:15] pilot light is on lights are on and the
[27:18] Lord kept the house and I want to say
[27:20] thank you Lord Jesus
[27:22] [Applause]
[27:30] praise the Lord everybody
[27:33] woke up this morning got out of bed and
[27:36] um as I got out of bed I just kept
[27:38] heading to the right
[27:40] and again when I put my shoes on and
[27:43] then lower I could feel my head spinning
[27:45] and lose
[27:47] religion
[27:48] I was talking to a brother
[27:51] to brother Greg there and he prayed for
[27:54] me
[27:55] and I I can feel just this pressure in
[27:58] my head this morning as I came up here
[28:00] all of that left me this morning
[28:03] so I just want to use a testimony that
[28:05] we were talking about in the message how
[28:08] the lives of
[28:09] um uh what's his name again
[28:12] the with the whistle
[28:14] Brother Bird how God used the whistle
[28:18] and and the deer line shooting just as
[28:21] an example it was
[28:23] that's right and I just want to use John
[28:27] Ryan from mine thank you Lord for
[28:29] healing me thank you Lord for healing
[28:34] Hallelujah
[28:37] I have a quick one too brother Stephen
[28:40] if that's okay we I don't know what
[28:42] possessed me to um you know we moved out
[28:44] to Kings Mountain we got a little bit of
[28:45] land we already bought a couple of goats
[28:48] and I I don't know what was asking but
[28:51] last uh last Saturday week ago we
[28:53] purchased a couple little bottle fat
[28:55] calves
[28:56] and you know I'm looking at YouTube and
[28:58] I'm like I can do this
[29:00] even with two of them
[29:02] well it's a little harder than you might
[29:04] think because they pull these little
[29:06] calves off their mamas after their
[29:07] colostrum like day one or day two
[29:10] day two and uh ours are three weeks old
[29:12] now but we've had a pretty rough week
[29:15] we've had one that's been dehydrating
[29:17] you know pretty bad since about I don't
[29:20] know Wednesday or Thursday
[29:23] a lot of Tears a lot of praying over
[29:25] just a little baby cow she's a sweet got
[29:28] a sweet nature
[29:29] so um I mean I even brought it up to
[29:31] brother Stephen and he he says he went
[29:33] to prayer for her as well
[29:36] So Yesterday we've been trying to give
[29:39] her a little bit of electrolytes because
[29:40] she is dehydrated and she wouldn't take
[29:42] a milk they drink about her
[29:44] uh two quarts of milk twice a day and
[29:47] she wouldn't take that and she wouldn't
[29:49] take the electrolytes it was like she
[29:51] didn't drink anything at all yesterday
[29:52] and I just thought well this is it can't
[29:54] get any liquids in her you know
[29:56] so I woke up this morning
[29:58] um thinking you know I'm gonna have a
[30:00] little dead calf on my hands or
[30:02] you know when she's laying there
[30:04] um you know she's in pain she had little
[30:07] tears running out of her eyes yesterday
[30:08] and when she breathes she just kind of
[30:11] goes You Can Tell She's agonizing I'm
[30:14] thinking well if she's not any better
[30:16] you know I'm gonna have to just go ahead
[30:18] and put her out of her misery and I'm
[30:20] thinking oh my goodness well I got up
[30:22] this morning I have to feed them before
[30:23] five o'clock in the morning so I got up
[30:25] and I only took one bottle down for the
[30:28] other calf I wasn't anticipating
[30:31] being in you know doing anything with
[30:33] this little sickling
[30:34] and I got up and uh they got a clock
[30:37] inside of them too
[30:39] because this little sick calf was
[30:40] standing at the edge of the pen waiting
[30:43] for me to come with her bottle
[30:45] and I fed I went ahead and fed the other
[30:47] one because I was there with the bottle
[30:49] warm and that little sicken was nudging
[30:51] me because she was wanting her bottle so
[30:53] I rushed up to the house fixed her a
[30:55] bottle she drank the whole bottle this
[30:58] morning the whole thing
[31:02] so
[31:04] we haven't decided if we're going to
[31:07] call her Miracle or Victory or Overcomer
[31:10] yet or something but she's got a name
[31:12] coming amen
[31:13] so I do not have any prayer requests yes
[31:17] sir
[31:20] I I don't mind if we got
[31:22] we don't want to make too much into the
[31:24] preacher's time but amen go ahead go
[31:26] ahead well this this kind of goes along
[31:30] with the story you just said but it
[31:33] involves my wife let me tell you not
[31:36] trying to save my wife as a cow okay I'm
[31:38] not trying to do that
[31:40] laughs
[31:47] no we're not doing that we're not doing
[31:49] it because I know she's listening in
[31:54] but anyway uh you know she had that
[31:57] surgery uh what four weeks ago
[32:00] and she was doing good up till about two
[32:03] weeks ago and she shredded some chicken
[32:05] and she ate that and then it's just like
[32:09] it relapsed
[32:11] to before she had the surgery
[32:14] and now the last two weeks she's been
[32:18] back on a liquid diet
[32:21] and just in pain and we don't know
[32:24] what's going on
[32:26] so anyway
[32:28] um
[32:29] uh
[32:30] this morning on the way here I was
[32:33] listening to a greater than Solomon it's
[32:35] here from 1963.
[32:38] and um
[32:41] um
[32:42] he got to the end of the message and he
[32:45] called he he was praying for people and
[32:46] one of the people he called for was
[32:49] stomach issues
[32:52] and I'm thinking Lord if he calls three
[32:54] people
[32:55] that'll be a witness to me that this
[32:58] thing is over with
[33:02] he called three people
[33:06] so and on the way on the way down here
[33:10] I'm thinking well we didn't read the
[33:12] scripture and we didn't pray before I
[33:14] left
[33:15] because I was trying to beat brother
[33:16] Lamont here
[33:20] but anyway so when I got here I called
[33:23] her I said you know we didn't pray and
[33:25] we didn't read the scriptures so I read
[33:27] the scripture and we prayed on the phone
[33:28] and while I was praying you know I told
[33:32] her about the the three Witnesses on the
[33:34] tape that I heard before I told her
[33:37] about that first and then while we were
[33:39] praying
[33:40] it hit me here is the same situation
[33:45] brother Branham when he was in Louisiana
[33:48] and his wife in Arizona with the tumor
[33:54] and I said here is the same situation or
[33:57] miles apart
[33:59] you got this situation going on we're on
[34:02] the telephone and here it is repeating
[34:04] again
[34:05] so I just wanted to get and it's over
[34:07] with
[34:08] it's done
[34:14] come up and play this morning okay
[34:17] Let's uh let's stand I don't have any
[34:19] prayer requests we're going to ask
[34:21] brother Charles to pray this morning
[34:24] that is creepy Heavenly Father we thank
[34:27] you Lord God
[34:28] so much to thank you for in this hour
[34:30] Lord God
[34:32] and Lord we are taught by Your Word Lord
[34:34] and your Prophet Lord that when a word
[34:36] is preached Heavenly Father Lord your
[34:38] spirit has to come behind it Lord
[34:42] and Lord this is the gospel Lord God
[34:43] it's not just a word father
[34:46] the lord it's you father it's it's
[34:48] Elohim it's the logos Lord God that is

[1:06:40] because I'm sure that most of you don't
[1:06:43] know who I am
[1:06:44] but I uh as brother Stephen said on many
[1:06:48] men brother Chad Lamb's Church in Lima
[1:06:51] Ohio there and I knew right away
[1:06:53] something was very unique about that man
[1:06:57] just the way he spoke out the the
[1:07:00] confidence that he had I knew I said
[1:07:02] Lord there's something special about
[1:07:04] this man
[1:07:05] and you certainly are a blessed people
[1:07:08] here in Gastonia North Carolina we we
[1:07:12] certainly are envious I just want to
[1:07:14] come down here and go to this church
[1:07:15] [Laughter]
[1:07:18] [Applause]
[1:07:21] well I would be the best amenor brother
[1:07:24] Stephen I I you probably wouldn't get me
[1:07:27] to sit down
[1:07:31] my wife she unfortunately couldn't make
[1:07:34] the trip this time but uh
[1:07:37] she said you know honey why don't you
[1:07:39] just be a good uh Pew message believer
[1:07:42] and just sit there I said don't you
[1:07:45] think I want to I it's so much easier
[1:07:48] right brother Stephen then to just sit
[1:07:51] there I I
[1:07:53] the greatest thing I have in my life is
[1:07:56] to listen to this message to read this
[1:07:59] word to spend time praying unto the
[1:08:02] father amen
[1:08:06] better
[1:08:08] it's like icing on the cake to be able
[1:08:10] to sit where you're sitting and feast on
[1:08:12] this kind of manna
[1:08:14] oh my
[1:08:17] we are certainly blessed that's for sure
[1:08:21] my name is Dan Ratliff and I Pastor a
[1:08:24] small Church in Gregory Michigan and
[1:08:27] I've only I'm a young I might be old but
[1:08:30] I'm a young pastor
[1:08:33] but don't let the white hair fool you uh
[1:08:37] I'm just going to call it wisdom brother
[1:08:41] you know that's what I say
[1:08:44] now
[1:08:46] if if you ask my wife she'd say
[1:08:49] sometimes I may not be able to agree
[1:08:51] with that but
[1:08:54] praise God I'm thankful for uh my wife
[1:08:59] her name is Sister Lynn and she God
[1:09:05] predestinated her to be my wife before
[1:09:08] the foundation of the world
[1:09:10] and I know you husbands here will argue
[1:09:13] with me and that's okay I don't don't
[1:09:16] don't look any or just look up here now
[1:09:19] Brothers

[1:09:41] that's all you got to do
[1:09:44] we don't want to make any enemies before
[1:09:46] we get started
[1:09:48] praise God
[1:09:51] I was uh
[1:09:53] I was born and raised in this message
[1:09:57] but you know there comes Growing Pains
[1:10:01] there comes learning curves we'll call
[1:10:04] it that that's the politically correct
[1:10:06] way to say it I guess
[1:10:09] look we'll just go out and say it until
[1:10:12] you're born again
[1:10:13] [Music]
[1:10:16] [Applause]
[1:10:18] God don't have any grandchildren that's
[1:10:20] for sure no no no
[1:10:24] but he he's got sons and daughters
[1:10:27] [Laughter]
[1:10:30] praise God yes my brother let me tell
[1:10:32] you what when you've had the new birth
[1:10:34] yes sir
[1:10:36] nobody has to tell you I swear that you
[1:10:40] have it or not
[1:10:42] isn't that right brother Stephen yes my
[1:10:45] brother you don't have to manufacture no
[1:10:48] sir what the prophet say the Sheep do
[1:10:52] they bear wolf aha
[1:10:55] it's in them
[1:10:57] they just can't help but manifest the
[1:10:59] wolf
[1:11:02] praise God glory to God I am just so
[1:11:05] thrilled in my heart to you know uh what
[1:11:08] God is doing here in spoken word
[1:11:10] you have no idea
[1:11:12] maybe you do maybe you don't I don't
[1:11:14] know
[1:11:15] but let me tell you up in Michigan
[1:11:18] up in Michigan a long ways from here
[1:11:21] amen where it's nice and cool
[1:11:26] I called he said

[1:11:33] you are privileged family of God
[1:11:36] you are blessed with a servant of God a
[1:11:40] pastor that I believe was ordained by
[1:11:43] God
[1:11:44] to take you to a body change
[1:11:47] amen
[1:11:49] you know brother Branham said I
[1:11:52] I want to give him his roses now
[1:11:56] uh-huh
[1:11:59] I'm not lifting up a man because the
[1:12:01] prophet also said this is important to
[1:12:04] catch
[1:12:05] the prophet also said that to say thank
[1:12:08] you to no man aha
[1:12:11] go take a look at it
[1:12:13] [Laughter]
[1:12:14] because no man receives his glory
[1:12:19] now we're thankful for the gifts
[1:12:23] and we appreciate oh I might get myself
[1:12:26] in trouble here brother Stephen
[1:12:28] but we appreciate
[1:12:30] the gift from God
[1:12:34] we appreciate the gift from God Amen
[1:12:40] amen just like
[1:12:42] your wife appreciates her husband amen
[1:12:47] amen now she doesn't worship or bow down
[1:12:50] to him is this okay
[1:12:52] preach my brother preach
[1:12:55] she don't bow down to him
[1:13:00] okay yes
[1:13:03] but but husbands
[1:13:08] you know
[1:13:10] there there was an old German man
[1:13:13] that said honey I told you I loved you
[1:13:17] at the altar
[1:13:20] oh he just brothers just looked right
[1:13:23] here
[1:13:27] he said if that changes I'll let you
[1:13:30] know now let me tell you how that worked
[1:13:32] out for him
[1:13:36] your wives need to hear you love her
[1:13:41] just like our lord Jesus likes to hear
[1:13:44] you love him
[1:13:47] he knows
[1:13:49] he he knows your heart
[1:13:54] he knows your thoughts
[1:13:56] they speak louder but he wants you to
[1:13:59] tell him I love you Lord
[1:14:01] I love you Lord
[1:14:04] oh wow
[1:14:06] my goodness yes sir
[1:14:09] isn't God good to us
[1:14:14] you know
[1:14:14] [Applause]
[1:14:18] now the unfortunate thing is is that
[1:14:20] this is being streamed
[1:14:22] and and my wife's gonna say no honey
[1:14:28] do you tell me you love me
[1:14:29] [Laughter]
[1:14:31] you know we got to be transparent that's
[1:14:34] right
[1:14:37] I just say Lord help me
[1:14:40] [Laughter]
[1:14:42] praise God
[1:14:44] wow yes sir
[1:14:47] we are blessed God wants us to enjoy our
[1:14:51] salvation
[1:14:52] he said I would that you would prosper
[1:14:54] in health yes
[1:14:57] he doesn't want you to be sick
[1:15:03] oh somebody's pulling brother Stephen I
[1:15:06] I I'm trying to go back to my my sermon
[1:15:08] here
[1:15:12] yes my brother
[1:15:13] look I I I did a little study on the
[1:15:17] choices we make
[1:15:21] yes my brother yes sir yes sir the
[1:15:27] choices we make
[1:15:30] unfortunately
[1:15:32] we put them bad choices on our father
[1:15:38] [Applause]
[1:15:40] oh God's putting me through this trial
[1:15:43] God's doing this to me
[1:15:49] and and then here's the bad thing
[1:15:52] brother Stephen is the link my father
[1:15:55] and the devil in the same category
[1:15:57] because they say the devil made me do it
[1:16:01] Now isn't that silly
[1:16:04] God didn't make you do anything
[1:16:07] the devil didn't make you do anything
[1:16:11] you made the choice
[1:16:14] I made the choice
[1:16:18] the new birth yes
[1:16:21] uh-huh
[1:16:22] the new birth is not on the body
[1:16:27] not even in the spirit
[1:16:32] but it's in the soul
[1:16:36] you don't have a choice there
[1:16:40] you
[1:16:42] you just either believe
[1:16:44] are you don't believe
[1:16:46] [Applause]
[1:16:47] [Music]
[1:16:49] it is either word
[1:16:52] or not word
[1:16:55] there's no
[1:16:57] black white in God's economy
[1:17:00] there's no gray area we call that a pale
[1:17:03] area that's a dead area isn't it
[1:17:08] glory to God
[1:17:11] the choices we make
[1:17:13] [Music]
[1:17:16] and it will have ramification it's like
[1:17:19] when you throw a pebble in the pond
[1:17:22] you get the ripple effect
[1:17:28] so maybe if I could just uh this is from
[1:17:31] a pastor's heart can I just share a
[1:17:33] pastor's heart
[1:17:35] yes sir
[1:17:37] don't misunderstand me
[1:17:40] Satan will bring thoughts to your mind
[1:17:43] not your soul
[1:17:46] he can't touch that
[1:17:52] but if he can get you to destroy
[1:17:55] yourself
[1:17:58] my goodness
[1:18:01] why do you think he hates you so much
[1:18:05] because he can't touch it
[1:18:07] he can't get that soul that came from
[1:18:10] God
[1:18:12] um yes
[1:18:14] sir you every one of you could spend
[1:18:17] hours giving me a testimony sharing your
[1:18:19] your testimony of your life this morning
[1:18:21] amen and even in through the times uh
[1:18:25] that the enemy has attacked you as a
[1:18:27] body try to destroy you as a body we got
[1:18:31] news for the enemy this morning you
[1:18:33] can't destroy God
[1:18:38] now you're too late for that
[1:18:41] you can try to tell me there was no
[1:18:43] Bridge Vision you can try to tell me
[1:18:45] that this didn't happen and that didn't
[1:18:47] happen that doesn't move me
[1:18:50] glory to God I didn't mean him on a
[1:18:53] bridge
[1:18:53] [Applause]
[1:18:57] I didn't even meet him at an altar oh
[1:19:03] I met him before the foundation of the
[1:19:06] world
[1:19:08] before there was ever anything
[1:19:11] I you the bride was in his thoughts yes
[1:19:19] and the devil knows that
[1:19:22] [Laughter]
[1:19:26] and the devil knows things
[1:19:29] you're going to make mistakes
[1:19:33] because of your choices
[1:19:36] because of your emotions that's it
[1:19:39] but it doesn't unsave you that's it
[1:19:43] so when the Devils I don't know who's
[1:19:45] pulling but when the Devil comes to your
[1:19:48] door
[1:19:50] [Applause]
[1:19:52] when the Devil comes knocking at your
[1:19:55] door and said there's no hope for what
[1:19:58] you did yesterday
[1:20:01] [Applause]
[1:20:02] there's no hope for you because you have
[1:20:05] anxiety or depression
[1:20:07] that means that you must be
[1:20:09] demon-possessed come on somebody preach
[1:20:11] with me
[1:20:13] it just means you have an enemy
[1:20:15] that's trying to work in that Spirit
[1:20:17] Realm
[1:20:19] that's the emotional Realm
[1:20:22] that's not where we serve God no sir
[1:20:25] we serve God just like I said before I
[1:20:29] love you amen I we are one Jesus prayed
[1:20:33] father I pray that day and I are one yes
[1:20:37] sir like you and I are one
[1:20:39] all right
[1:20:41] Oh Glory to God
[1:20:44] praise God
[1:20:49] wow
[1:20:53] that just makes you want to sit down in
[1:20:55] a corner and cry
[1:21:02] remove your name amen from the book
[1:21:07] you didn't put it in there to begin with
[1:21:11] that's it
[1:21:14] brother Brandon said get the Holy Ghost
[1:21:16] before Satan does what
[1:21:20] takes your mind
[1:21:23] not your soul
[1:21:27] mine nothing
[1:21:29] you were sealed before the foundation of
[1:21:31] the world
[1:21:32] this is a subject I've been studying
[1:21:35] deeply yes
[1:21:37] yes I haven't had the time to and I
[1:21:39] don't think I could ever exhaust that
[1:21:41] study
[1:21:43] but I believe one of the most
[1:21:45] misunderstood and let me just make a
[1:21:47] disclaimer before I start
[1:21:49] if I say anything contrary to what your
[1:21:52] pastor says you stay with what your
[1:21:55] pastor says
[1:21:57] is that the word way
[1:21:58] is that what we're taught
[1:22:01] we just had to get that out of the way
[1:22:04] so the Devil Couldn't try to throw
[1:22:06] something up
[1:22:08] we just family that's
[1:22:10] we just want to serve God
[1:22:16] but the most one of the most
[1:22:19] misunderstood
[1:22:22] Revelations that was revealed in the
[1:22:24] seals right right was election and
[1:22:27] predestination the prophet called it I
[1:22:30] know it's a big word
[1:22:33] and that's what the prophet said
[1:22:35] he said predestination I know that's a
[1:22:37] big word for you Pentecostals are for
[1:22:40] you Baptists
[1:22:43] yes
[1:22:46] so I know when I've learned through the
[1:22:48] School of Hard Knocks brother Greg
[1:22:50] that when the enemy is attacking me on a
[1:22:53] certain point
[1:22:55] God must really have something important
[1:22:57] to say
[1:22:59] [Applause]
[1:23:00] so when God is coming into your private
[1:23:03] life or when Satan's coming into your
[1:23:05] private lives attacking you behind
[1:23:07] closed doors on a certain subject you
[1:23:11] just know this God knows
[1:23:13] that's it and you can be assured that
[1:23:17] his bride is going it God's going to
[1:23:20] expose the enemy
[1:23:26] one of the greatest misunderstood
[1:23:28] teachings yes sir is election yes
[1:23:32] predestination I'm not going to bring
[1:23:34] Doctrine to another man's Pulpit he's
[1:23:36] well gifted
[1:23:38] you have a very good teacher uh we give
[1:23:42] we give praise to God for the gift in
[1:23:44] the church amen
[1:23:47] my goodness can I get started yes my
[1:23:50] brother I didn't start my time clock
[1:23:53] [Laughter]
[1:23:56] maybe we could just stand together and
[1:23:58] to rest our bodies for a moment and turn
[1:24:01] to First Corinthians chapter 12.
[1:24:04] First Corinthians chapter 12.
[1:24:10] we're just going to read a verse here
[1:24:12] verse 3.
[1:24:17] I wish to speak to you this morning by
[1:24:19] the grace of God the voice of God
[1:24:22] the voice of God
[1:24:25] praise God
[1:24:29] First Corinthians chapter 12 verse 3.
[1:24:36] I hear a few pages turning so we'll just
[1:24:39] be patient
[1:24:42] I like how brother Stephen says I want
[1:24:44] you to see it in the Bible
[1:24:47] I want you to see it for yourself so you
[1:24:50] know I'm just not telling you something
[1:24:55] First Corinthians 12 and verse 3.
[1:24:59] wherefore I give you
[1:25:01] to understand
[1:25:03] as Paul speaking now
[1:25:05] that no man speaking by the spirit
[1:25:08] listen carefully now
[1:25:10] by the spirit not of man
[1:25:14] of God
[1:25:16] calleth Jesus a curse now that's really
[1:25:20] important
[1:25:21] there's no way I can finish this
[1:25:24] this teaching this morning
[1:25:27] but maybe if I can just share a little
[1:25:29] bit of my heart with you
[1:25:32] and then you can go back and study and
[1:25:34] search this out would that be okay
[1:25:37] I appreciate your kindness and welcoming
[1:25:40] Spirit here this morning Paul saying
[1:25:44] that no man speaking by the spirit of
[1:25:47] God calleth Jesus a curse
[1:25:50] now here's the other side of them
[1:25:53] that no man can say that Jesus is the
[1:25:58] Lord
[1:25:59] but by the Holy Ghost
[1:26:04] amen by the Holy Ghost
[1:26:08] may the Lord bless the reading of his
[1:26:10] words you may have your seats
[1:26:17] now I want to just uh give you a little
[1:26:20] bit of an example before I get started
[1:26:23] and that is I want to take you to the
[1:26:26] scene
[1:26:27] where Jesus is asking his disciples
[1:26:31] who he is
[1:26:34] but the first question is who do men say
[1:26:39] yes my brother yes sir yes Paul caught
[1:26:43] that vision
[1:26:44] are you with me
[1:26:48] preach
[1:26:49] that this this word is it works
[1:26:53] we we just
[1:26:55] we just got to let the word do what the
[1:26:58] word does amen
[1:27:01] God didn't ask my opinion about it
[1:27:04] he certainly didn't ask me should he or
[1:27:06] should he not write this or that he had
[1:27:09] that all figured out
[1:27:13] if somebody tells you that there's
[1:27:15] contradiction in the scripture that just
[1:27:18] tells me they ain't got the new birth
[1:27:25] I mean I'm not I'm not down in that
[1:27:27] person I'm just saying they they must be
[1:27:29] born again
[1:27:31] we must be born again that's it each one
[1:27:34] has to have that new birth yes
[1:27:37] yes sir without the new birth you can
[1:27:40] never recognize
[1:27:42] who your father is
[1:27:46] are you with me don't don't get confused
[1:27:48] on that no because there's uh oh here we
[1:27:51] go there's a seed down inside of you
[1:27:54] brother Branham said it was the Deep
[1:27:56] call us to the Deep
[1:27:59] so that
[1:28:01] that's the voice of God
[1:28:04] calling to the voice of God
[1:28:10] if I get to the end of this it'll be a
[1:28:13] miracle
[1:28:16] preach my brother listen to Paul's
[1:28:18] letter again
[1:28:20] wherefore I give you to understand in
[1:28:25] other words listen carefully
[1:28:27] I got something important to say to
[1:28:30] it that no man he'd left
[1:28:32] no question
[1:28:34] that no man
[1:28:36] speaking by the spirit of God now
[1:28:39] there's man
[1:28:41] that's it that's it that's it that
[1:28:43] handle the word of God is this okay yes
[1:28:47] that handle the word of God
[1:28:50] that are not called to handle the word
[1:28:53] of God
[1:28:55] neither do they have the what
[1:28:58] the spirit of God
[1:29:02] I
[1:29:05] yep yes
[1:29:06] [Applause]
[1:29:15] yes
[1:29:16] [Applause]
[1:29:17] yes
[1:29:18] perfect so I guess I'll make myself at
[1:29:21] home ah
[1:29:22] [Laughter]
[1:29:25] praise God
[1:29:29] and we could die just turn over to II
[1:29:32] Timothy
[1:29:36] second Timothy three I will again want
[1:29:39] to lay a scriptural Foundation to what
[1:29:41] I'm telling you
[1:29:43] so now you uh now you will see it for
[1:29:46] yourselves
[1:29:48] and you'll say no man told me this but
[1:29:51] God himself that's exactly
[1:29:53] exactly yes sir second Timothy chapter
[1:29:55] three
[1:29:57] now keep this in mind what Paul has said
[1:30:02] that no man
[1:30:05] no man except by the spirit of God Amen
[1:30:09] amen yes sir
[1:30:11] second Timothy chapter three
[1:30:14] if you're there say amen amen
[1:30:18] I like how this starts out
[1:30:21] verse one this no also yes
[1:30:26] it's it's fun to read the word of God to
[1:30:29] me
[1:30:29] it's a joy to me
[1:30:32] this no also so now
[1:30:35] on to the word like okay tell me tell me
[1:30:38] right
[1:30:39] I'm not saying I'll have to read so when
[1:30:42] brother Stephen asked me if I read
[1:30:45] um I read it
[1:30:48] I read it because it constrains me to
[1:30:51] read that's my brother it brings me joy
[1:30:54] yes sir
[1:30:55] praise God
[1:30:57] trust me I learned that through Hard
[1:31:00] Knocks
[1:31:02] this no also
[1:31:03] that in the last days we are there
[1:31:07] that this was prophecy
[1:31:11] and this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:31:16] amen amen
[1:31:18] he says that
[1:31:19] in the last days
[1:31:22] perilous times shall come
[1:31:25] so we wonder why
[1:31:27] say father why why is this happening why
[1:31:29] is it I told you why
[1:31:32] I told him
[1:31:36] I warned you this was going to come
[1:31:40] Hallelujah can I go on
[1:31:44] my brother that in the last days
[1:31:45] perilous times shall come but let's go
[1:31:48] to verse 2.
[1:31:50] can we read verse two yes
[1:31:53] for men
[1:31:58] also now we're finding
[1:32:00] we're finding the deception of the enemy
[1:32:03] that's it he likes to hide
[1:32:06] but he needs a body to hide in that's
[1:32:10] that boy
[1:32:12] oh boy
[1:32:14] I don't know about you
[1:32:16] but he ain't got no room in the end here
[1:32:19] [Music]
[1:32:22] because this room's full
[1:32:25] this this room's full
[1:32:27] of the Holy Ghost
[1:32:29] [Applause]
[1:32:30] full of the spirit of God
[1:32:33] so now I can recognize brother Kelly who
[1:32:36] Christ is
[1:32:38] and I can identify not only who Christ
[1:32:41] is
[1:32:43] but who I am
[1:32:46] because we are one
[1:32:49] there's no room for the enemy
[1:32:52] brother Brandon said you can't help when
[1:32:54] the thoughts come over you
[1:32:59] but don't let them take a nest
[1:33:03] don't sit there and ponder about that
[1:33:05] thought
[1:33:07] the prophet taught us take it to the
[1:33:09] word
[1:33:12] be good bereans and and study and show
[1:33:15] yourself approved
[1:33:17] oh boy
[1:33:20] glory to God
[1:33:23] for men
[1:33:25] shall be lovers so if the first verse is
[1:33:28] true yes
[1:33:31] the second verse is true also
[1:33:34] amen
[1:33:36] for men shall be lovers of their own
[1:33:40] selves
[1:33:42] that's the problem
[1:33:45] that's the problem
[1:33:48] so you know the Bible tells us that
[1:33:51] there are three things
[1:33:56] that stand in our way
[1:34:01] now let's be careful it's not three
[1:34:03] other people
[1:34:05] it's not your neighbor
[1:34:09] lust of the flesh yes lust of the eyes
[1:34:12] and the pride of life yes
[1:34:16] it seems so simple
[1:34:21] but what happens is
[1:34:23] we start listening to another voice
[1:34:27] other than the voice of God
[1:34:30] amen
[1:34:32] amen
[1:34:35] we listen to our own voices
[1:34:41] nobody
[1:34:43] nobody knows this like I do
[1:34:49] a sectarian is
[1:34:53] it's when they say this little group
[1:34:56] right here
[1:34:59] this little group right here we have the
[1:35:01] voice of God
[1:35:03] and if you aren't in this little group
[1:35:05] right here
[1:35:09] that's it
[1:35:10] that's it
[1:35:11] what you effectively have done is
[1:35:15] silence the voice of God
[1:35:18] because you have your own voice
[1:35:23] now you can read the scriptures
[1:35:26] you can quote the quotes
[1:35:29] but that doesn't mean that you can call
[1:35:32] him Lord Jesus
[1:35:34] pray to my brother
[1:35:37] that just means you're educated that's
[1:35:40] [Music]
[1:35:41] it that means you just have the ability
[1:35:43] to read words that's it and remember
[1:35:45] them and make notations
[1:35:47] uh-huh
[1:35:49] but when the spirit of God moves upon
[1:35:52] you
[1:35:53] when the anointing comes upon brother
[1:35:57] Bynum said a man shouldn't handle this
[1:35:59] word unless he's met the pillar of Fire
[1:36:07] yes sir I have to leave that there
[1:36:10] preach about that
[1:36:13] can I go on one step further
[1:36:16] Paul said First Corinthians 12 3 that
[1:36:20] you can't even sit there and receive the
[1:36:23] word
[1:36:24] without meeting him the Holy Ghost
[1:36:28] without the spirit of God do you do you
[1:36:31] understand what I'm saying
[1:36:33] otherwise
[1:36:35] star benchwarmer
[1:36:38] but when it's life to you
[1:36:41] when it's life to you
[1:36:46] it'll metamorph you it'll change you you
[1:36:50] become a new creature in Christ Jesus
[1:36:54] your old things are passed away
[1:36:57] now the devil doesn't forget about your
[1:36:59] old things though that's right
[1:37:02] but God
[1:37:06] according to the message doesn't see
[1:37:09] them no more
[1:37:12] oh win win confessed
[1:37:16] when a true repentance not that we got
[1:37:18] caught
[1:37:19] not not that somebody called us on the
[1:37:22] carpet about it but that the pillar of
[1:37:25] fire personally came to you
[1:37:29] because it's hard and as I would
[1:37:32] preaching as much as I would teach her
[1:37:34] as much as brother Stephen uh would
[1:37:36] would a tremendous teacher of this word
[1:37:39] and gift it would hand it over to you we
[1:37:41] can't give you revelation neither can
[1:37:44] the prophet give you Revelation but the
[1:37:47] Holy Ghost
[1:37:49] he will lead you to all truth
[1:37:53] that's that's the simple as it gets yes
[1:37:58] that's as simple how do I know because
[1:38:01] I'm more witness of that
[1:38:04] I'm a very uneducated man
[1:38:07] I didn't like school
[1:38:10] apparently graduated
[1:38:13] at a young age God called me at 13 years
[1:38:17] old God put a poll in my life
[1:38:21] but the last thing I wanted to do
[1:38:25] was preach this message
[1:38:31] first for for a couple of reasons if I
[1:38:33] just might be honest with you preach my
[1:38:34] brother
[1:38:36] one is
[1:38:38] um no
[1:38:40] I
[1:38:41] huh I can barely read and write
[1:38:45] how are you
[1:38:47] how are you going to have me stand in
[1:38:49] front of people and read that's kind of
[1:38:51] embarrassing
[1:38:55] I can't even say my words right A lot of
[1:38:57] times
[1:39:00] by two that's the problem
[1:39:04] I've seen a lot of hypocrisy
[1:39:12] so how can
[1:39:13] I'm young
[1:39:16] even now I'm young
[1:39:19] remember I said don't let the white hair
[1:39:21] fool you yes
[1:39:22] but at the age of 13.
[1:39:26] I could hear what's being said
[1:39:31] then I go home
[1:39:34] or I go over to such and such home we
[1:39:37] don't need to say names or anything like
[1:39:39] that that's not important the point is
[1:39:41] right when I don't see a Living Word
[1:39:49] that's it my brother
[1:39:51] that's it my brother
[1:39:55] yes my brother
[1:39:57] yes sir so let me even just start right
[1:40:00] here at the pulpit if we may uh-huh
[1:40:02] if I preach this message yes sir
[1:40:05] and leave here and go live a different
[1:40:08] life there's no confidence not in me but
[1:40:12] in the word that's
[1:40:16] do you see why Satan took chapter or
[1:40:19] verse 2 of chapter three here in second
[1:40:22] Timothy
[1:40:23] except for men shall be lovers of their
[1:40:25] own selves that's right
[1:40:27] self-motivation motives that drive the
[1:40:31] choices we make that's
[1:40:33] the choices we make
[1:40:36] but let me just tell you if you ever
[1:40:38] meet that Pillar of Fire if you ever
[1:40:40] come in contact with the spirit of God
[1:40:43] it'll change your life you won't have to
[1:40:46] seek God brother Brenda preached a
[1:40:48] message called discernment yes
[1:40:52] oh here we go
[1:40:54] [Music]
[1:40:56] I'm just gonna come
[1:40:58] get right down here
[1:41:00] and just talk with you
[1:41:02] share a pastor's heart maybe yes my
[1:41:04] brother
[1:41:06] you know
[1:41:08] when when a man
[1:41:11] stands behind a Pulpit right
[1:41:14] let's even go a little bit further
[1:41:17] when a husband
[1:41:19] comes to church
[1:41:22] and he says Amen to the word
[1:41:26] and on the outside he's looking really
[1:41:28] good uh-huh
[1:41:30] you might even see him hugging his wife
[1:41:33] right
[1:41:35] holding her hand maybe as they go
[1:41:37] through the mall or whether sitting at
[1:41:40] the restaurant huh
[1:41:44] but let that can't get rubbed backwards
[1:41:47] one time
[1:41:50] yes my brother and you'll see what that
[1:41:52] man's made of that takes
[1:41:58] when perilous
[1:42:01] every home
[1:42:03] you find out whether that man is
[1:42:05] familiar with the voice of God
[1:42:07] or the voice of the enemy
[1:42:12] you'll find out which one
[1:42:15] he's been listening to really yes my
[1:42:18] brother maybe even saying amen too
[1:42:23] yes
[1:42:25] you understand yes sir pretty soon
[1:42:30] it's manifesting time
[1:42:34] there was a former Reign the teaching
[1:42:36] rain
[1:42:37] now the latter rain which is the Harvest
[1:42:40] rain which is now the manifesting or the
[1:42:43] Gathering of the fruits yes
[1:42:47] yes it's a gathering of the crops if I
[1:42:49] can say it that way
[1:42:51] the spirit of God is brooding over the
[1:42:54] Earth
[1:42:56] is brooding down through the Earth
[1:43:00] collecting the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:43:03] pulling it out of this one here pulling
[1:43:06] it out of this one here pulling this
[1:43:08] little group out of this one right here
[1:43:10] and he said she will be without spot or
[1:43:13] ring
[1:43:14] [Applause]
[1:43:17] she'll be there'll be no blemish
[1:43:21] but to the onlooker
[1:43:24] to the outside oh you can't come in here
[1:43:27] because you don't think like us
[1:43:29] you don't see it like us have you ever
[1:43:32] been there
[1:43:34] and then you begin to doubt your own
[1:43:37] walk
[1:43:38] you begin to doubt your own
[1:43:40] revelation
[1:43:43] but Jesus said to the question he said
[1:43:47] who do men say that I am
[1:43:50] right something
[1:43:54] oh no now here's where the rubber meets
[1:43:56] the road
[1:43:59] but who do you say I am
[1:44:01] I'm in I'm in
[1:44:05] glory to God
[1:44:07] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:44:10] said to Peter
[1:44:13] blessed are thou yes sir
[1:44:16] because flesh and blood in other words
[1:44:18] men with motives
[1:44:23] men with false doctrines
[1:44:26] men with false preaching amen didn't
[1:44:29] show you that
[1:44:30] [Laughter]
[1:44:33] you see where Paul caught that
[1:44:37] Paul said oh under the inspiration of
[1:44:39] God
[1:44:40] right yes so it was the revelation of
[1:44:43] God the spin the spirit of God that
[1:44:45] moved upon Paul to write the word of God
[1:44:48] the letters of God to write the New
[1:44:49] Testament Brothers
[1:44:51] right amen
[1:44:53] to catch that and to hand it because now
[1:44:57] this letter ate the Corinthian Church
[1:44:59] was a believing church that poor brother
[1:45:02] Pastor Paul uh having to deal with that
[1:45:05] Corinthian Church
[1:45:06] I I say praise God I can't wait to shake
[1:45:09] his hand
[1:45:12] can you say Amen
[1:45:15] I know we have some Corinthian churches
[1:45:17] around here but just know this God has
[1:45:19] sent a message in this day to call a
[1:45:22] brine out of denominationalism to call a
[1:45:25] bride out of confusion
[1:45:29] to call a bride out of verse two second
[1:45:32] Timothy chapter three
[1:45:35] men lovers of themselves right
[1:45:40] but he said blessed are thou yes
[1:45:44] Flesh and Blood didn't reveal anything
[1:45:45] amen
[1:45:47] but my father
[1:45:49] which is in heaven yes he has to reveal
[1:45:52] and now here's the key part that Upon
[1:45:55] This Rock the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:46:01] and let me go one step further it's the
[1:46:04] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[1:46:08] you
[1:46:10] in this hour yes
[1:46:12] yes it's the same spirit of God but it's
[1:46:16] in a different time
[1:46:18] so there's a message that doesn't work
[1:46:21] for that time but there's a message that
[1:46:23] works for this time
[1:46:24] are you with
[1:46:29] so the prophet will teach us in that
[1:46:31] message to German if you haven't heard
[1:46:33] that I encourage you go listen to it it
[1:46:35] will really change uh some some of our
[1:46:38] perception of different things it's very
[1:46:40] correcting
[1:46:42] let me say that
[1:46:44] yes sir if I might just share it I
[1:46:45] didn't put any of the quotes up here for
[1:46:47] it but you can go back and take a look
[1:46:49] at it uh and I encourage you to like I
[1:46:51] said I don't want you to take my word
[1:46:53] for it but the prophet said not to look
[1:46:56] at the person right
[1:47:02] right yes sir
[1:47:03] but to discern the spirit
[1:47:08] you are called you each and every one of
[1:47:11] you the members of the body of Jesus
[1:47:14] Christ is called to discern the spirit
[1:47:18] of men
[1:47:19] even if they are of another belief that
[1:47:23] come on now I'm just preaching message
[1:47:25] to you
[1:47:26] these these aren't my ideas I ain't that
[1:47:28] educated
[1:47:32] but to discern the spear
[1:47:35] that's in them they may be a Baptist
[1:47:38] right
[1:47:40] I'm just trying to let you have some
[1:47:42] peace about some things so we knock down
[1:47:44] this cult thinking
[1:47:46] that's exactly right you hear me
[1:47:51] when you're able to discern the spirit
[1:47:54] in a man yes
[1:47:57] then you can find out they have the same
[1:47:59] motive as you do
[1:48:03] let me go another step further and quote
[1:48:05] the prophet it's still the spirit of God
[1:48:07] in them
[1:48:08] [Applause]
[1:48:10] that's why the prophet would call them
[1:48:12] brother
[1:48:15] but he would go one step further and say
[1:48:18] now let's bring you home how about
[1:48:20] Discerning the spirit that's in me
[1:48:25] oh
[1:48:28] it's easy to look and see somebody else
[1:48:33] it's easy to hear the voice of God for
[1:48:35] somebody else
[1:48:36] exactly right but let's start calling on
[1:48:38] the name of Jesus for ourselves
[1:48:41] because the scripture said if your heart
[1:48:44] condemns you what
[1:48:46] then ask
[1:48:50] so if there's no condemnation in me I
[1:48:52] can hear there's a Clear Channel between
[1:48:55] me and the father
[1:49:00] it's pretty simple to me
[1:49:04] it's so simple I just believe it
[1:49:07] I'm very thankful
[1:49:10] God didn't make me an intelligent man
[1:49:21] you asked some of my family they'll say
[1:49:23] he's dumb as rock but you know I forgive
[1:49:26] them for that but
[1:49:30] there's no big eyes little use in this
[1:49:33] economy
[1:49:34] we are brothers and sisters
[1:49:39] I can love you just like I can love my
[1:49:42] own immediate family my own biological
[1:49:44] DNA
[1:49:47] because I see and can discern the spirit
[1:49:49] of God in Me and the discernment of the
[1:49:52] spirit of God in you and know that in
[1:49:55] this place
[1:49:57] the Master's welcome
[1:49:59] [Applause]
[1:50:00] there's no hindrances here
[1:50:06] I I think maybe maybe
[1:50:09] the devil tried to show up to church
[1:50:13] but when the spirit of God where there's
[1:50:16] unity in the spirit of God
[1:50:20] there's power
[1:50:22] amen
[1:50:25] Discerning the spirit of God
[1:50:30] [Music]
[1:50:34] wow
[1:50:36] what a message that is
[1:50:39] there you go brother Stephen
[1:50:42] it just makes me want to go back and
[1:50:44] listen to it again
[1:50:46] amen amen praise God what time of day is
[1:50:50] it anyhow
[1:50:52] can I read to you uh
[1:50:56] out of the church age book
[1:51:03] s
[1:51:05] now if I stumble
[1:51:08] you can laugh it'll be all right
[1:51:12] it's the very last page
[1:51:15] the very last page
[1:51:18] of the church age so now if you've
[1:51:20] gotten through the church age book you
[1:51:22] get to the icing on the cake
[1:51:25] can I read it to you now
[1:51:30] not for one moment do I bring a message
[1:51:32] to the people that they may what
[1:51:36] follow me
[1:51:42] so now we have a servant of God a
[1:51:44] Vindicated prophet of God
[1:51:48] all right
[1:51:49] that is not fulfilling verse 2.
[1:51:54] [Music]
[1:51:58] speak to God if God wouldn't even allow
[1:52:00] him to smoke a cigarette come on
[1:52:03] if God wouldn't even allow him to take a
[1:52:06] drink because of his emotions
[1:52:10] you know the life story I'm sure you've
[1:52:11] heard it
[1:52:13] I don't have to labor there
[1:52:15] if God won't allow wouldn't allow that
[1:52:18] office to be polluted in that way
[1:52:24] certainly he would keep him from
[1:52:26] self-motivation
[1:52:30] this messenger
[1:52:32] for this day had no motive but to point
[1:52:36] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:52:39] to the author and finisher of our faith
[1:52:41] it's the alpha omega principle yes my
[1:52:44] brother
[1:52:46] do you understand the alpha omega
[1:52:48] principle
[1:52:51] it doesn't include about me I'm just
[1:52:54] included in that principle
[1:52:57] [Music]
[1:52:58] all praise God
[1:53:03] not for one moment do I bring this just
[1:53:06] kills all the critics
[1:53:09] you had a motive brother brainer you
[1:53:12] were point he sat in the seals he said
[1:53:15] in the seven seal he said now when this
[1:53:17] gets out it's going to cost me ten
[1:53:19] thousand of my friends
[1:53:24] he called them friends oh that's another
[1:53:27] subject let's stay away from that one
[1:53:31] praise God I'll leave it for one of
[1:53:34] these evangelists how about that
[1:53:36] he says do I bring a message to the
[1:53:39] people that they may follow me or join
[1:53:45] you folks are well taught
[1:53:48] that's amazing
[1:53:52] brother Stephen
[1:53:54] you've got a wonderful Church
[1:54:00] so when you have a minister saying or a
[1:54:02] pastor let's just put it in my lap
[1:54:05] when you have a pastor saying come to my
[1:54:07] church we teach this
[1:54:10] come come to my church
[1:54:13] we have the full truth
[1:54:16] yeah red flags are going every direction
[1:54:21] but when you have somebody say to you
[1:54:24] have you ever heard the voice of God
[1:54:28] what what do you mean is there a voice
[1:54:30] of God
[1:54:32] it's kind of like when the question was
[1:54:35] asked have you been baptized
[1:54:39] we know not whether there be any baptism
[1:54:42] how are you baptized
[1:54:45] have you heard the voice of God in this
[1:54:47] day
[1:54:49] yes my brother you might get some funny
[1:54:51] looks
[1:54:54] you might get some strange responses at
[1:54:56] first but as long as you're not pointing
[1:54:59] to yourself
[1:55:00] Jesus said take no thought of what you
[1:55:03] shall say
[1:55:05] for in the hour I will speak through
[1:55:09] so when there's no motive
[1:55:12] when there's no objective but Christ
[1:55:15] when we just want to point others to
[1:55:18] Christ
[1:55:22] then he can freely use you
[1:55:25] but if you find yourself struggling to
[1:55:28] witness to somebody
[1:55:30] we still believe in that right
[1:55:32] we
[1:55:36] I got a few we still believe in
[1:55:38] witnessing
[1:55:39] wasn't that the commission going to all
[1:55:42] the world
[1:55:45] now you don't have to stand back open
[1:55:47] and preach brother
[1:55:49] your life brother Bynum said yes sir the
[1:55:52] greater preacher greater Ministry than I
[1:55:55] could have standing behind us yes
[1:55:57] because you only get to hear me for an
[1:55:59] hour and Lord bless you for that but
[1:56:03] it's your life that people will see let
[1:56:05] me just bring it at home with you it's
[1:56:07] your life that your wife will see
[1:56:09] it's your life that your children will
[1:56:12] see yes my brother oh my
[1:56:16] God
[1:56:19] listen to these words
[1:56:24] to follow me or join my church or start
[1:56:27] some fellowship
[1:56:30] and organization
[1:56:35] um
[1:56:39] [Music]
[1:56:42] I I think God's cleaning the house
[1:56:45] not not here but around the world
[1:56:51] it didn't just start yesterday
[1:56:57] you know God's words are eternal
[1:57:02] ah
[1:57:04] he said I have never done that and will
[1:57:08] not do that now
[1:57:15] well I can have confidence
[1:57:18] in a man like that that you discern the
[1:57:21] spirit it's not a human being yes
[1:57:24] yes I don't worship the human being
[1:57:28] I discern the spirit that's in the man
[1:57:34] praise God
[1:57:37] I mean you you can read this book
[1:57:41] we know it was inspired by God but you
[1:57:43] know
[1:57:44] it came through a voice of a prophet
[1:57:48] can can you imagine brother Stephen
[1:57:52] being in the prophet shoot I I don't
[1:57:54] even want to try to imagine that
[1:57:57] I've literally heard people say I wish I
[1:58:00] had what he had or I wish you'd be
[1:58:02] careful what you're wishing for
[1:58:05] when God calls a man
[1:58:08] he ordains that man he equips that man
[1:58:11] I'm I'm preaching now to the family here
[1:58:13] when when
[1:58:15] God calls a family
[1:58:19] he equips that family
[1:58:21] now there will be perilous times
[1:58:22] there'll be trials let me tell you this
[1:58:26] God never tempts you
[1:58:31] [Applause]
[1:58:34] that that Temptation comes from the
[1:58:36] Devil
[1:58:37] exactly like
[1:58:38] are you with me brother Burnham said
[1:58:41] that God will allow trials to come
[1:58:43] for testing and and it's not now this is
[1:58:47] where we got to catch this by the way
[1:58:49] this all has to do with the voice of God
[1:58:51] if you haven't caught that already
[1:58:55] but what God will do is he'll allow this
[1:58:59] to take place
[1:59:01] but it's not so remember job right
[1:59:04] remember Joe
[1:59:06] God knew
[1:59:09] God knew
[1:59:11] who Joe was
[1:59:14] before
[1:59:15] God knew exactly what job was going to
[1:59:18] do
[1:59:21] some will say God sent job up for
[1:59:23] failure Maybe
[1:59:24] [Music]
[1:59:26] what God was doing was manifesting
[1:59:29] himself in job
[1:59:32] because there will come false accusers
[1:59:36] with men of their self-motives
[1:59:40] they will strongly accuse you they will
[1:59:44] strongly tear you down they tried to
[1:59:47] destroy the testimony in your lives but
[1:59:51] sometimes God allows that do you hear me
[1:59:54] Church's spoken word
[1:59:56] you are
[1:59:58] can I maybe say that the Church of job
[2:00:01] God has allowed testing maybe if I could
[2:00:04] give you a message this morning
[2:00:06] God has allowed the testing to manifest
[2:00:10] himself in the pure unadulterated work
[2:00:14] in Gastonia North Carolina
[2:00:16] [Applause]
[2:00:20] not because he had confidence in you but
[2:00:23] he had confidence in the spirit of God
[2:00:25] that was in you
[2:00:28] the prophet would call it the fullness
[2:00:31] the Fulfillment of God in you in this
[2:00:35] hour
[2:00:36] praise God
[2:00:38] praise God
[2:00:40] praise God
[2:00:42] [Applause]
[2:00:45] I don't care what the devil throws at
[2:00:46] you
[2:00:47] [Applause]
[2:00:48] God knows yes yes sir yes so don't be
[2:00:54] discouraged if one's battling depression
[2:00:56] or anxiety
[2:00:59] God will never leave you nor forsake you
[2:01:02] God will never let you go
[2:01:06] yes my brother he's here to tell you
[2:01:08] this morning it's okay maybe he's here
[2:01:11] to tell you it is well it Is Well with
[2:01:15] My Soul

[2:01:20] Glory
[2:01:21] to glory to God
[2:01:23] can you say that this morning yes from
[2:01:26] the bottom of your heart
[2:01:28] [Applause]
[2:01:32] blessed be the day
[2:01:35] I'm trying not to cut up right now
[2:01:39] there's language coming from all
[2:01:41] different directions but let me tell you
[2:01:43] what he deserves my praise and my glory
[2:01:46] because it is well inside my soul
[2:01:52] he transformed me from Darkness into
[2:01:55] life
[2:01:56] the things that I used to desire I
[2:01:58] desire them no more
[2:02:01] you may remember my past but my heavenly
[2:02:04] father the Alpha and the Omega he never
[2:02:08] remembers it
[2:02:10] I'm free
[2:02:13] I'm free
[2:02:15] let me just say this the prophet of God
[2:02:17] you know the story about the man the
[2:02:19] soldier that was bound by homosexuality
[2:02:21] spirit
[2:02:25] it just took the word friends
[2:02:28] it just took the voice of God
[2:02:31] not the voice of a man but the voice of
[2:02:34] the god and that demon had to walk out
[2:02:38] and I had no choice he didn't stand can
[2:02:41] somebody hear me
[2:02:43] he didn't say you have to come to the
[2:02:45] altar
[2:02:46] he didn't say it's not going to work
[2:02:48] unless you come up here and put a show
[2:02:50] on
[2:02:52] he just took a walk with the prophet
[2:02:56] [Music]
[2:02:56] [Laughter]
[2:02:59] he took a walk with the messenger of
[2:03:02] this hour
[2:03:04] and the spirit of God that was upon that
[2:03:07] messenger let me even say this that was
[2:03:09] in that messenger
[2:03:11] protruded out of him
[2:03:15] it was the spirit of God the voice of
[2:03:17] God do you hear me
[2:03:19] that came out of the messenger and that
[2:03:22] demon had to leave and what did he say
[2:03:29] I'm free if you're bound this morning
[2:03:33] the voice of God is here in this room
[2:03:35] it's not me it's the voice of God in
[2:03:38] this room telling you you can be free
[2:03:42] you don't have to come to an altar I'm
[2:03:45] not against altar calls
[2:03:48] but you can get it right in your seat
[2:03:52] it works
[2:03:54] it works
[2:03:56] yes my brother praise God
[2:04:00] praise
[2:04:03] [Music]
[2:04:07] to my brother preacher
[2:04:11] he that the spirit is set free is free
[2:04:15] indeed
[2:04:16] [Applause]
[2:04:20] oh my goodness
[2:04:23] praise God
[2:04:28] what a wonderful presence of God
[2:04:35] preach my brother
[2:04:39] can I give you a little testimony
[2:04:43] I was bound by cigarettes
[2:04:49] do I have any former smokers
[2:04:53] so you know what I'm talking about
[2:04:56] do I have any former drinkers
[2:05:01] well I'm right at home
[2:05:05] nine nine among amongst alcoholics not
[2:05:08] amongst Sinners but the redeemed
[2:05:12] [Applause]
[2:05:15] you see we have a unique Fellowship
[2:05:18] we understand one another
[2:05:20] [Applause]
[2:05:23] it's like the little boy went to buy
[2:05:25] that dog right
[2:05:27] and he said I'm gonna take that one and
[2:05:29] that one had a bum leg
[2:05:31] and the owner said why why son why would
[2:05:33] you buy that dog it's all broken leg
[2:05:36] and he pulled up his leg
[2:05:38] and he had a prosthesis hunt
[2:05:41] he said we understand one another
[2:05:44] [Music]
[2:05:45] we understand what you have a heavenly
[2:05:48] father that came down embodied in a
[2:05:51] Corporal body
[2:05:52] [Music]
[2:05:54] that whether you're 12 years old and
[2:05:57] you're fighting a pornography addiction
[2:05:58] whether you're 13 years old fighting
[2:06:01] suicide for uh oppression whether you're
[2:06:04] a 15 year old trying to find your
[2:06:06] identity he knows can you say he knows
[2:06:11] he knows
[2:06:20] the redeemed of the Lord say so
[2:06:25] amen my favorite song
[2:06:29] it is well
[2:06:32] I wish I was a good singer
[2:06:36] oh praise God
[2:06:39] um
[2:06:44] I was bound
[2:06:46] by nicotine demon
[2:06:50] [Music]
[2:06:53] look you know I I I like giving God the
[2:06:56] glory
[2:06:58] But Not only was I bound when I told you
[2:07:01] that God called me and I ran into the
[2:07:03] world let me tell you
[2:07:05] I put it like my mother-in-law told me
[2:07:08] she she told my wife she said look as
[2:07:11] hard as he served the devil
[2:07:14] that's as hard as he's going to serve
[2:07:16] God
[2:07:17] because it's in his nature pray to my
[2:07:20] brother
[2:07:22] so when I was bound by the enemy let me
[2:07:24] just say I was bound by a lot
[2:07:28] but to give God the glory it was one day
[2:07:32] and I was driving truck
[2:07:35] I think there's another truck driver in
[2:07:37] the church here yeah
[2:07:42] I knew I'm in good company
[2:07:47] I told you I wasn't a rocket scientist
[2:07:53] you know when I
[2:07:55] brother Stephen when when I went to uh
[2:07:59] when when God spoke to my heart
[2:08:01] and said this is your last chance
[2:08:04] it got my attention
[2:08:06] he knows just what to do
[2:08:11] that was his love
[2:08:13] I said okay I give up
[2:08:16] I stopped running
[2:08:18] but I had a lot of baggage
[2:08:21] I have a lot of scars
[2:08:29] I can't take those scars away but my
[2:08:32] father
[2:08:33] he has a new body
[2:08:37] right
[2:08:39] it's never had a taste of cigarette
[2:08:42] a drink of alcohol doesn't have a tattoo
[2:08:45] that you hear me
[2:08:48] it's perfect like his own body
[2:08:53] so when I felt that pull this is why I'm
[2:08:56] telling you I know at work I'm not
[2:08:57] speaking from the outside looking in I'm
[2:08:59] not telling you something that I'm
[2:09:01] guessing at I'm living in shoe leather
[2:09:04] walking in shoe leather to testify to
[2:09:07] the Bride of Jesus Christ in this hour
[2:09:10] it works
[2:09:13] it works you can write that down on a
[2:09:16] magnet put it on your refrigerator and
[2:09:19] every time the enemy comes by just say
[2:09:21] it works
[2:09:23] praise God
[2:09:25] you see I had to be honest with God and
[2:09:28] he likes you to talk to him and be
[2:09:30] honest that's the key
[2:09:33] I said you know father
[2:09:39] my body really enjoys these cigarettes
[2:09:42] read to my brother
[2:09:46] my body really enjoys that alcohol
[2:09:50] that's the way to praise
[2:09:53] I'm not hiding anything at that point
[2:09:58] I need a friend
[2:10:00] there's no friend like Jesus
[2:10:03] I need help
[2:10:05] I need a Deliverance I couldn't I
[2:10:07] obviously proved I couldn't deliver
[2:10:09] myself
[2:10:10] if he let me go guess where I'm going
[2:10:12] preaching my brother
[2:10:15] that's why the new birth works
[2:10:20] when I told my pastor then that I was
[2:10:24] going to go into the truck driving world
[2:10:26] and I can't say that I blame him he said
[2:10:29] that's ridiculous
[2:10:31] you
[2:10:33] going into the truck driving and if you
[2:10:35] don't know the truck driving world you
[2:10:36] ain't missing anything
[2:10:39] but there ain't nothing good out there
[2:10:40] let me tell you
[2:10:43] [Laughter]
[2:10:46] you want to meet Devils aha
[2:10:51] God will have a witness everywhere
[2:10:52] though
[2:10:54] amen
[2:10:56] when I said to follow I said father my
[2:10:59] body really likes these
[2:11:01] it really enjoys those
[2:11:04] but I don't want to smoke
[2:11:07] I I don't have a desire to drink no more
[2:11:11] my body does and I sounded ridiculous to
[2:11:13] myself because you know I didn't even
[2:11:15] know how to really pray right
[2:11:19] I wasn't all fancy with my prayers like
[2:11:22] the publicans right
[2:11:26] I like the prophet he wrote a letter
[2:11:28] put it on a tree yes
[2:11:32] praise God
[2:11:35] listen I just said I need your help
[2:11:38] because I can't quit these things that's
[2:11:40] it that's it that's the key my brother
[2:11:42] you didn't uh oh here we go
[2:11:45] you didn't make me start
[2:11:52] I did that myself
[2:11:57] I can take you to the day I started
[2:12:00] and why did I do it
[2:12:02] because it was the cool thing to do
[2:12:06] it was popular with the ladies
[2:12:09] and we were big and cool
[2:12:13] thank you brother
[2:12:17] God likes a contrite heart
[2:12:23] he knows that's
[2:12:25] he knows
[2:12:28] so when you confess
[2:12:32] now repentance
[2:12:37] can I start my message now
[2:12:39] [Applause]
[2:12:41] my my repentance
[2:12:44] was true
[2:12:48] I never tried to hide anything from
[2:12:51] anybody
[2:12:53] that's not that it never works
[2:12:57] right
[2:13:01] let me tell you I was in Pulaski
[2:13:04] Tennessee anybody know where Pulaski
[2:13:07] Tennessee is there we go
[2:13:10] uh maybe Cornersville Tennessee area
[2:13:14] and I was getting unloaded
[2:13:17] and let me tell you what I understood my
[2:13:19] pastor's heart
[2:13:21] that he said that's not good for you but
[2:13:23] it's exactly where God wanted me why
[2:13:26] because I need to hear the message in a
[2:13:28] pure form amen and I had lots of hours
[2:13:32] to listen to the message can I just be
[2:13:34] honest with you now
[2:13:35] [Music]
[2:13:36] I would stop the message
[2:13:39] to smoke a cigarette
[2:13:47] look I know it works
[2:13:50] I didn't want to disrespect the message
[2:13:53] while I was smoking I had enough sense
[2:13:56] about that
[2:14:03] [Laughter]
[2:14:07] I would never speak against the prophet
[2:14:10] because I knew that was truth
[2:14:14] even though I didn't surrender myself to
[2:14:17] it
[2:14:18] I knew it was true
[2:14:21] I couldn't explain anything to you
[2:14:23] somebody asked me what the godhead was
[2:14:25] I'd be like I have no idea
[2:14:27] somebody I remember I was raised in a

[2:20:02] of anxiety and depression huh
[2:20:05] pray to my brother
[2:20:07] I'm not speaking from an office
[2:20:12] I was one
[2:20:17] in my mid-30s
[2:20:19] a married man
[2:20:22] I was on my mother's couch curled up
[2:20:25] like a little baby
[2:20:28] feeling I had lost my mind
[2:20:33] I would go to work and have to turn
[2:20:35] around and come back home
[2:20:38] because I would feel like I was going to
[2:20:40] die
[2:20:42] I would feel like
[2:20:44] I just overwhelming if you unless you've
[2:20:46] been there you don't understand
[2:20:48] but my father's been there
[2:20:51] he understands he knows
[2:20:57] it was horrible
[2:21:00] I can't tell you how many trips I made
[2:21:02] to the hospital
[2:21:04] friends look demonic bondage is horrible
[2:21:09] run for your life
[2:21:12] don't see how close you can get to it

[2:21:17] just just get shot in with Jesus it'll
[2:21:20] be okay
[2:21:22] [Applause]
[2:21:23] I would go to the hospital
[2:21:26] on a regular basis
[2:21:29] my whole life would be brother Steve
[2:21:31] informed around
[2:21:33] that I was close enough to a hospital
[2:21:35] that if I had a heart attack I could get
[2:21:38] there get in there within four minutes
[2:21:41] hold on
[2:21:42] I spent a lot of time of course we
[2:21:45] didn't have Google there
[2:21:48] they still had medical dictionaries
[2:21:51] an uneducated person trying to read
[2:21:55] but I was trying to to know and
[2:21:57] understand think for God
[2:22:00] I knew better than the doctors
[2:22:03] they would say you have perfectly good
[2:22:05] health no no you're missing some I have
[2:22:07] a heart attack or something
[2:22:10] it's a real bondage friends
[2:22:17] preach my brother
[2:22:20] it works
[2:22:23] they had me on Xanax and then of course
[2:22:26] that's such I don't know if any of you
[2:22:27] know what that is but it's such a
[2:22:30] powerful drug yes sir
[2:22:32] super addictive
[2:22:38] addiction and you know
[2:22:39] the enemy knows what he's doing uh-huh
[2:22:44] but one day yes
[2:22:48] the voice of God come speaking
[2:22:51] amongst all that confusion
[2:22:56] it's kind of like Jonah was
[2:23:00] whenever you're in trouble
[2:23:03] look East

[2:23:31] [Music]
[2:23:35] they don't call it depression for
[2:23:37] nothing
[2:23:39] because you're always looking down
[2:23:47] oh when there's freedom
[2:23:50] when there's freedom
[2:23:53] and there's joy in the joy of the Lord
[2:23:55] what happens to your hands

[2:24:27] I know him as my savior
[2:24:30] My Healer
[2:24:32] and my restore
[2:24:35] because that's what he said in Malachi
[2:24:37] 4.
[2:24:38] I come to restore the hearts of the
[2:24:41] children back to the father let me just
[2:24:43] say it this way I come to restore the
[2:24:46] seed back to its original position
[2:24:50] Christ is a mystery of God revealed his
[2:24:52] threefold purpose
[2:24:53] [Applause]
[2:24:58] great
[2:25:01] I don't even know why I put this up here

[2:25:16] let's read this together I'm going to
[2:25:19] close here okay can we open the airport
[2:25:21] brother
[2:25:21] [Laughter]
[2:25:24] foreign
[2:25:26] I thought I was a quiet pastor
[2:25:30] look what you did to me
[2:25:33] you know brother Tim cross warned me of
[2:25:35] you
[2:25:38] [Applause]
[2:25:42] I like to see the joy of the Lord
[2:25:47] all right let's let's read this before
[2:25:50] although we aren't worried about any
[2:25:52] chicken burning are we or any roast beef
[2:25:56] Lord Jesus not for a show or not to do
[2:26:00] that but that your word might be
[2:26:06] listen carefully to this this is
[2:26:08] beautiful
[2:26:09] you never heal the people just because
[2:26:12] to show your God
[2:26:15] but it was the fulfilling
[2:26:18] it was fulfilling
[2:26:20] the word
[2:26:21] and that's the way
[2:26:23] why I do this
[2:26:27] father is my faith
[2:26:31] to believe listen to this careful let's
[2:26:33] let's just let the prophet say what he
[2:26:36] said
[2:26:37] don't think
[2:26:40] right I tell the church back home don't
[2:26:42] think Carnival
[2:26:44] we're in Heavenly places now
[2:26:48] father is my faith
[2:26:51] to believe that this good woman
[2:26:55] can be healed of what
[2:26:59] so a good woman
[2:27:02] uh-huh I'm just letting you see yes my
[2:27:05] brother I'm just letting you see
[2:27:09] don't never let the devil tell you
[2:27:12] you're not a good person
[2:27:14] okay
[2:27:16] yes
[2:27:17] yes it's not about your looks
[2:27:21] we don't go by looks it's in you're well
[2:27:24] taught you're well taught spoken word
[2:27:26] you understand there's a body realm
[2:27:28] there's a spear around and there's a
[2:27:30] soul realm we understand what the
[2:27:33] prophet said about the spirit Realm
[2:27:36] can can I can I continue with this
[2:27:39] right
[2:27:41] the prophet said
[2:27:43] that you don't think with your brain
[2:27:48] go look at it
[2:27:52] I'm not a physician I'm just telling you
[2:27:54] what the problem says
[2:27:58] he said it's just a bunch of muscle and
[2:28:00] cells
[2:28:02] listen to me carefully
[2:28:05] now I don't know why God's going this
[2:28:07] direction but we're just going to go
[2:28:09] he just did a 180 degree turn with the
[2:28:12] plane
[2:28:16] listen your brain
[2:28:21] sends signals to your body
[2:28:24] that's that's its function yes sir right
[2:28:27] yes
[2:28:29] God designed this body
[2:28:32] I think he did a good job
[2:28:39] the prophet of God said now listen
[2:28:40] carefully
[2:28:43] the prophet of God said that a doctor
[2:28:45] can set a bone
[2:28:49] but he can't heal you that's exactly
[2:28:52] right that's exactly we thank God for
[2:28:54] doctors
[2:28:56] they have their place right
[2:28:59] that's what the prophet said right
[2:29:03] now if God uh chose to use a physician
[2:29:06] to remove a tumor
[2:29:08] and they get all that tumor out of there
[2:29:09] then good the life has to leave right
[2:29:12] right it doesn't have something to dwell
[2:29:14] in right but your brain now look the
[2:29:18] devil is very smart
[2:29:21] he's good at his job
[2:29:24] he studies you
[2:29:26] right right
[2:29:31] he listens to your conversations
[2:29:41] right now
[2:29:42] he can't hear what you think
[2:29:45] but he hears what you confess
[2:29:48] [Applause]
[2:29:52] yes my brother
[2:29:54] so if you think one thing you know I'm
[2:29:57] quoting a prophet now
[2:29:59] and you do another what
[2:30:02] you better stop that
[2:30:06] [Music]
[2:30:07] yes my brothers
[2:30:09] he said you don't think with your brain
[2:30:12] but the devil studies you because he's
[2:30:15] got to know how to attack you that's
[2:30:17] right
[2:30:18] so he's looking for your weakness
[2:30:22] he's looking to find the weak spot the
[2:30:25] prophet said you got to cover that weak
[2:30:27] spot how do you cover that with the word
[2:30:30] with the voice of God
[2:30:33] it works
[2:30:36] my brother
[2:30:39] so when you have a psychology oh
[2:30:43] trying to tell you that you have a part
[2:30:45] of your brain
[2:30:47] that wasn't developed and this is why
[2:30:50] you're depressed or this is why that's a
[2:30:52] lie
[2:30:54] that goes back to the devil
[2:30:58] now I'm not saying that that physician
[2:31:02] is trying to be wrong
[2:31:05] but I got to just stay with what the
[2:31:06] prophet says that's it
[2:31:09] it's not a brain issue
[2:31:15] your emotion your memory your reason
[2:31:18] your imagination your conscience is in
[2:31:22] the spirit Realm
[2:31:24] amen that's where you think with
[2:31:27] that's where you have a memory of amen
[2:31:30] that's where you reason amen
[2:31:33] amen
[2:31:35] amen and brother Stephen it's also where
[2:31:39] you can sear your conscience
[2:31:46] listen to me carefully the devil can't
[2:31:49] seal your conscience
[2:31:51] but if he can get you
[2:31:54] to do it
[2:31:55] what does that mean
[2:31:58] preaching my brother take your time
[2:32:02] can I just break that down just a little
[2:32:04] bit break it down
[2:32:08] look I thought about it a bunch of times
[2:32:10] of putting a circle up there but we're
[2:32:13] just gonna roll with it
[2:32:16] at home I wouldn't
[2:32:19] listen thank you brother
[2:32:23] listen
[2:32:24] God doesn't deal with you in your spirit
[2:32:27] Realm
[2:32:32] but you have to be able to take it in
[2:32:35] exactly right exactly right it has to
[2:32:39] come through the inlets the five senses
[2:32:41] has to drop in through the spirit
[2:32:44] through the spirit that
[2:32:48] listen we're looking at seer in your
[2:32:50] conscience
[2:32:53] but if you stop it right there
[2:32:55] [Applause]
[2:32:57] if you stop it right there
[2:33:01] it's an intellectual understanding
[2:33:04] that's it
[2:33:10] and I'm afraid
[2:33:13] there's been a lot of intellectual
[2:33:14] preaching that's exactly
[2:33:19] but when it drops past the spear around
[2:33:21] brother
[2:33:23] and it strikes that soul
[2:33:28] ah
[2:33:30] you want to know what the sign of the
[2:33:32] new birth the evidence of the new birth
[2:33:33] is
[2:33:35] is that you say Amen to every word
[2:33:40] not that you reasoned it out in your
[2:33:42] mind and it was correct
[2:33:45] you're too late to tell me that nonsense
[2:33:49] amen that was the whole issue in the
[2:33:52] beginning
[2:33:59] but when it strikes the soul
[2:34:02] and there's a seed of God there it can't
[2:34:05] help but say Amen
[2:34:08] I don't understand it all but amen
[2:34:11] [Applause]
[2:34:13] that's it my brother I can put it on the
[2:34:17] shelf of my heart
[2:34:19] do you hear me
[2:34:20] if somebody wants to make fun because I
[2:34:22] say I have to put on the Shelf of my
[2:34:24] heart that's not going to sway me
[2:34:26] anywheres because I'm looking and
[2:34:28] pressing towards the mark of the high
[2:34:30] calling in Christ Jesus
[2:34:32] [Music]
[2:34:35] I'm Not Looking Back
[2:34:38] but I'm looking forward
[2:34:44] if we stay that's right
[2:34:47] the frogs that Look Backwards right
[2:34:50] yes sir
[2:34:53] but she they follow the shepherd
[2:34:58] hey don't worry he he's got me
[2:35:01] amen
[2:35:03] but when the voice of God
[2:35:05] it gets through all the physical
[2:35:13] and it gets through all the spiritual
[2:35:17] it has this wonderful tendency by the
[2:35:20] correct to clear up all this fogginess
[2:35:25] and some that has been sitting right
[2:35:27] next to you for all their life will say
[2:35:30] why is it so clear to you and so foggy
[2:35:33] to me
[2:35:37] do you understand now how it works
[2:35:41] you it's not complicated
[2:35:44] we just have to get past verse two of
[2:35:48] second Timothy 3.
[2:35:51] amen amen wow
[2:35:56] when it strikes the soul that's it
[2:36:00] it doesn't have any senses it's got one
[2:36:04] sense
[2:36:05] the prophet of God would call it the
[2:36:07] what
[2:36:09] faith
[2:36:10] now can I preach
[2:36:12] amen
[2:36:18] Hallelujah it was fulfilling the word
[2:36:23] and that's the way why I do this tonight
[2:36:26] father is my
[2:36:29] friend so it wasn't emotion
[2:36:33] do I have a little Freedom I'm in
[2:36:36] that's the problem with many youth camps
[2:36:42] [Applause]
[2:36:46] I'm sorry brother Stephen you will
[2:36:48] probably get some backlash for that one
[2:36:50] I get to go home
[2:36:52] but but he's got big shoulders so
[2:36:56] God's equipped him well
[2:37:02] okay
[2:37:06] wow
[2:37:07] yeah I did I went there sorry not sorry
[2:37:15] look
[2:37:16] unless music
[2:37:24] but that's where it starts
[2:37:25] [Applause]
[2:37:28] why don't you know
[2:37:31] you start to find pastors
[2:37:35] song leaders youth leaders joining in
[2:37:38] with denominational
[2:37:41] oh
[2:37:44] so if you have denominational seats
[2:37:48] you're going to have denominational
[2:37:49] babies
[2:37:52] [Applause]
[2:37:56] let me go one step further
[2:37:58] it's because they're afraid of the word
[2:38:00] but let me tell you what it works
[2:38:04] you don't have to make somebody come to
[2:38:06] Jesus you
[2:38:09] [Applause]
[2:38:10] you don't have to work them up to come
[2:38:12] to Jesus
[2:38:14] you don't have to try to discern them
[2:38:17] [Music]
[2:38:18] [Applause]
[2:38:19] the word says he's a discerner of the
[2:38:22] thoughts and the intents of the heart
[2:38:23] you don't have to put on a show
[2:38:26] just let the word work
[2:38:29] then it has a solid foundation
[2:38:31] [Applause]
[2:38:34] and I'm afraid there's been too many
[2:38:37] denominational babies been hatched
[2:38:40] they'll have to give an account for that
[2:38:42] friends
[2:38:43] that's between them and God my purpose
[2:38:46] today is to bring you a pure message
[2:38:49] from almighty God
[2:38:51] [Applause]
[2:38:52] to tell you it works brother
[2:38:55] it works yes my brother
[2:38:58] this message works
[2:38:59] [Applause]
[2:38:59] [Music]
[2:39:01] I'm the recipient of it
[2:39:07] [Applause]
[2:39:10] I believe it was the prophet that said
[2:39:13] [Music]
[2:39:16] to sing a few songs
[2:39:19] is this okay
[2:39:21] to create a right atmosphere
[2:39:24] [Applause]
[2:39:27] to create a right atmosphere
[2:39:30] not a spiritual atmosphere
[2:39:34] but a soul-changing atmosphere
[2:39:37] [Music]
[2:39:40] where he will be welcomed
[2:39:43] where he will be walking
[2:39:46] and it starts at home
[2:39:48] [Applause]
[2:39:50] [Music]
[2:39:51] when you know Wednesday night service is
[2:39:54] coming up tonight
[2:39:57] stop right
[2:39:59] start seeking God
[2:40:04] you'll get what you expect
[2:40:08] but it transforms right from the home
[2:40:13] right from the vehicle outside
[2:40:15] into the sanctuary
[2:40:17] [Music]
[2:40:19] this this is the house of God
[2:40:23] right here
[2:40:27] but it's not for a show
[2:40:32] is that what your Prophet said
[2:40:34] it's not for a show but for the glory of
[2:40:38] God
[2:40:39] because there's really truly people that
[2:40:42] are bound by addictions
[2:40:45] that are too scared to come out and say
[2:40:47] I need help
[2:40:50] because of what somebody might say about
[2:40:52] them
[2:40:56] we've got our own families kicking
[2:40:58] children out of their families because
[2:41:01] they don't dress right because they
[2:41:03] don't act right
[2:41:04] but instead of Discerning the spirit of
[2:41:07] God that's down inside that individual
[2:41:09] and letting the word do its work
[2:41:13] foreign
[2:41:15] call me to be a savior he did that
[2:41:18] do you hear me
[2:41:20] he called me to be a dad
[2:41:23] he called me to be a husband
[2:41:25] he called me to be a brother he called
[2:41:28] me to be a friend
[2:41:30] and a preacher that'll get up here and
[2:41:33] try to save you is in the wrong motive
[2:41:36] friends
[2:41:40] glory to God but when you have a man
[2:41:43] that's yielded to this move of God
[2:41:47] that doesn't care what God says just let
[2:41:50] the word and it lines up from Genesis to
[2:41:52] revelation
[2:41:55] [Music]
[2:41:58] and it lines up from the entire message
[2:42:04] it works
[2:42:06] it works
[2:42:08] I promise you it works
[2:42:11] we get our youth together what is the
[2:42:14] purpose of that is it for a show
[2:42:18] is it to make money oh
[2:42:25] it's to introduce Jesus Christ look we
[2:42:28] don't get him the Holy Ghost one day and
[2:42:31] they get it another no no no no no no no
[2:42:32] no no that's not how it works
[2:42:35] [Music]
[2:42:37] once you've been born again you can't be
[2:42:41] unmarred
[2:42:48] now that's from an uneducated man
[2:42:52] that's coming fresh from the Throne of
[2:42:54] God
[2:42:56] the new birth works
[2:42:59] it works
[2:43:03] preach my brother if we can just get
[2:43:05] ourselves out of the way
[2:43:08] let me say this you notice how God's
[2:43:10] moving lately
[2:43:12] he's bringing people that you've never
[2:43:15] heard of before
[2:43:19] what the prophet say there'll be those
[2:43:21] there that you do
[2:43:25] don't ever give up on your children
[2:43:27] don't ever give up on your husband or
[2:43:29] your wife don't ever give up on yourself
[2:43:31] [Applause]
[2:43:34] it works
[2:43:36] it works I want every one of you to be
[2:43:39] able to say I
[2:43:41] am
[2:43:42] en I'm free to worship Him
[2:43:45] I'm free When I Call On the name of the
[2:43:48] Lord he's going to hear my prayer
[2:43:50] [Applause]
[2:43:52] amen
[2:43:54] amen praise God
[2:43:55] praise God
[2:43:58] the prophet never
[2:44:01] displayed a show no sir no sir he never
[2:44:05] your Liberty to show me
[2:44:07] pointed to himself
[2:44:14] matter of fact
[2:44:16] there come a point in time he wanted to
[2:44:18] go hide in the mountains
[2:44:23] now does that sound like oh does that
[2:44:25] sound like somebody that wants to do a
[2:44:27] public show
[2:44:29] he said this will not be a public show
[2:44:34] yes my brother
[2:44:45] this isn't a public show
[2:44:50] the voice of God is personally Christ's
[2:44:53] submission God revealed to you
[2:44:59] you just bring your little lick of fire
[2:45:01] amen
[2:45:03] thank you
[2:45:04] and when you bring your liquefier and
[2:45:07] your liquefier we got a bonfire
[2:45:10] [Applause]

[2:45:16] Fire
[2:45:19] praise God Amen
[2:45:21] preach my brother
[2:45:23] [Music]
[2:45:25] I gotta stop with these handles you guys
[2:45:27] are pulling weight
[2:45:35] God knows what he's doing
[2:45:38] if we can just set our motives aside
[2:45:42] let him have his perfect work in our
[2:45:44] life
[2:45:46] you'll be okay
[2:45:48] let's let's finish this up Lord help me
[2:45:52] father is my faith
[2:45:54] to believe that this good woman can be
[2:45:57] healed of this demon
[2:46:01] are you ready yes
[2:46:05] Satan
[2:46:08] I charge you
[2:46:10] in the name of William Brown
[2:46:14] so now we're looking
[2:46:17] in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:46:20] who triumphed Over All
[2:46:27] sicknesses come from the Devil
[2:46:32] clinical depression is a demon
[2:46:36] it comes from the Devil
[2:46:42] and it's under his feet
[2:46:46] and his servant I take
[2:46:51] I take the initiative in Jesus name
[2:46:54] Leave The Woman come out of her
[2:46:59] now let me ask you
[2:47:01] do you think that demon was just gonna
[2:47:04] maybe say wow
[2:47:07] he knew when he had to go
[2:47:10] now listen carefully
[2:47:12] listen very carefully to this
[2:47:15] this is I wanted to come to this
[2:47:20] and the message what is the attraction
[2:47:21] on the mountain
[2:47:22] he said what's the attraction
[2:47:25] that's what the attraction is the
[2:47:27] predestinated seed of God who can't do
[2:47:30] nothing else but follow it
[2:47:34] means more
[2:47:36] than life to us
[2:47:41] [Applause]
[2:47:44] does that sound like somebody reasoning
[2:47:46] to you
[2:47:48] take our lives
[2:47:51] but you don't take that
[2:47:54] what is the attraction
[2:47:57] God
[2:47:58] as usual
[2:48:00] [Laughter]
[2:48:01] you know it was common to the prophet
[2:48:04] brother Stephen
[2:48:06] to see the usual things of God
[2:48:09] because he dwelt in the atmosphere of
[2:48:11] God and let me just say you tell you
[2:48:14] this this morning I hope it's still
[2:48:15] morning
[2:48:16] but then you can have that same
[2:48:19] indwelling
[2:48:20] you can dwell in that atmosphere just
[2:48:23] like the prophet did
[2:48:27] let me take you to the message that is
[2:48:29] the rising of the sun he said it's the
[2:48:31] first fruits
[2:48:33] it's the first wave Chief offers
[2:48:37] what is he waving above the Bride of
[2:48:39] Jesus Christ not William Branham
[2:48:42] but the message
[2:48:45] he's waving the Harvest the first fruits
[2:48:48] the son of man Ministry fulfilled this
[2:48:51] day
[2:48:53] he never waved himself he waved it was
[2:48:57] the message
[2:49:03] the Fulfillment
[2:49:06] the Fulfillment
[2:49:10] amen write this down
[2:49:13] put it put it in your soul
[2:49:17] you won't for David said hide it in my
[2:49:20] heart I hide you I hide the word in my
[2:49:22] heart I won't forget
[2:49:25] listen carefully
[2:49:27] Hallelujah
[2:49:28] true repentance yes
[2:49:33] opens the door
[2:49:36] for the Fulfillment
[2:49:39] are you with me
[2:49:42] true repentance
[2:49:46] opens the door yes not emotional
[2:49:49] repentance
[2:49:51] so why would I want to lead you to an
[2:49:52] emotional repentance
[2:49:56] why would I want to lead you to an
[2:49:58] emotional response
[2:50:01] but if I can point you to the word
[2:50:06] it works
[2:50:10] and when a true repentance because the
[2:50:12] prophet of God said don't come up here
[2:50:14] with what
[2:50:16] sin in your life
[2:50:24] he didn't say attributes
[2:50:26] he said don't come up here with sin
[2:50:30] and what it said
[2:50:32] so don't come up here
[2:50:37] because it's going to get exposed
[2:50:39] [Applause]
[2:50:42] it it'll get exposed
[2:50:46] I gotta stay away from those Trails
[2:50:48] let's just focus here and close this
[2:50:55] so look we're not dwelling on healing
[2:50:57] that is a gift that's a promise from God
[2:51:00] first
[2:51:02] it worked
[2:51:07] it's there for for you for the believer
[2:51:12] because he knew you were going to need
[2:51:13] it
[2:51:15] right
[2:51:17] but it all starts with the principal
[2:51:20] Foundation of God's word
[2:51:23] is you have to be free from condemnation
[2:51:29] when you're free from condemnation
[2:51:33] you can receive the fullness
[2:51:35] of the spirit of God
[2:51:38] because then you can say
[2:51:42] to this mountain
[2:51:44] be removed
[2:51:46] uh are you with me yes
[2:51:50] so you without the fullness
[2:51:53] of the Holy Ghost
[2:51:56] you open yourself up
[2:51:58] to unbelief
[2:52:01] because you'll start working in that
[2:52:03] Spirit Room
[2:52:09] the prophet wasn't kidding
[2:52:11] when he said
[2:52:13] well there's a reason why that demon
[2:52:16] won't leave
[2:52:18] right because he has a right to stay
[2:52:20] there
[2:52:23] but when he's exposed
[2:52:28] it's really pretty simple
[2:52:31] right
[2:52:32] but if you want to follow
[2:52:36] but if you want to be bound by that
[2:52:39] there comes a point in time you worship
[2:52:42] that sickness
[2:52:48] why do people worship sickness
[2:52:53] oh
[2:52:54] [Music]
[2:52:59] because they receive attention
[2:53:06] oh
[2:53:15] yes
[2:53:21] [Applause]
[2:53:23] yes my brother
[2:53:26] now on yes my brother
[2:53:30] yes sir
[2:53:34] yes
[2:53:35] well I can tell you that devil didn't
[2:53:37] like that
[2:53:40] but we're going to expose him anyhow
[2:53:43] that's it my brother
[2:53:45] oh my
[2:53:50] God look
[2:53:52] the reason why people seek attention
[2:53:55] is because they're lacking it somewhere
[2:53:59] [Music]
[2:54:00] continue to move on
[2:54:08] that's why the prophet said it's not
[2:54:10] child delinquency that's exactly like it
[2:54:13] keep pressing you're getting ready get
[2:54:15] it it's apparent delinquency
[2:54:19] now look here let me tell you something
[2:54:21] you can't go back and undo what we did
[2:54:25] as parents
[2:54:28] my daughter and my son bear scars from
[2:54:31] my poor choices notice what I said there
[2:54:33] my poor choices
[2:54:37] I was selfish
[2:54:39] I didn't care about anybody else but
[2:54:41] myself
[2:54:42] and would do anything to get what I
[2:54:44] wanted
[2:54:51] I know none of you have ever felt that
[2:54:55] right
[2:54:57] but I'm I'm just here to stand as a
[2:55:00] testimony
[2:55:03] that he took a selfish nature
[2:55:06] he took a one that just wanted to please
[2:55:09] self
[2:55:10] so I'm not speaking as a novice to
[2:55:12] Second Timothy 3 2.
[2:55:16] but from experience
[2:55:20] I know what that demon is
[2:55:23] look
[2:55:25] what it is is you never see really what
[2:55:28] the devil is setting the trap for you
[2:55:31] about that's exactly right that's
[2:55:34] exactly right
[2:55:35] he's not just going to put up a neon
[2:55:37] sign he's not just going to put it up on
[2:55:39] a PowerPoint slide and preach to you
[2:55:41] with it
[2:55:44] he's going to find the weakness right
[2:55:47] right and where does he find that now
[2:55:48] this is a pastor's heart where does he
[2:55:51] find that weakness family stream
[2:55:54] I'm just telling you what the prophet
[2:55:56] says
[2:56:01] but you don't have to keep using that as
[2:56:04] an excuse
[2:56:05] [Applause]
[2:56:08] because there's a word in this hour that
[2:56:11] come to exposed
[2:56:12] [Applause]
[2:56:15] not only a family strength but a
[2:56:18] national string amen amen
[2:56:22] we are not other we're we're here in
[2:56:25] this world but we're not of this world
[2:56:27] exactly right we're of a Heavenly
[2:56:29] Kingdom amen amen and in the Heavenly
[2:56:32] Kingdom it's not about you and I no sir
[2:56:35] it's about him
[2:56:38] so the devil will come and ever so
[2:56:41] slightly use a strain use a weakness
[2:56:43] here yes use a weakness there and the
[2:56:46] next thing you know he's setting that
[2:56:49] young daughter of yours up to find a man
[2:56:52] that'll come along and fill Daddy's
[2:56:54] spine preach my brother
[2:56:56] oh
[2:56:59] that's exactly right
[2:57:05] and are you hearing me yes sir and the
[2:57:08] next thing you know she got pregnant by
[2:57:10] that guy
[2:57:12] and then because she's ashamed because
[2:57:15] when that devil gets what he wants he
[2:57:18] pulls back that's it and you realize
[2:57:20] what you just did
[2:57:26] [Music]
[2:57:27] now you're in a peculiar predicament
[2:57:33] the intelligent people say about curious
[2:57:35] or however they say
[2:57:39] preach my brother
[2:57:41] so then they're going to get abortion or
[2:57:43] they go and do this and now on social
[2:57:46] media you have you have the devil
[2:57:50] anointing people to say if you have
[2:57:52] abortion you're not in this preach a
[2:57:55] sectarian it's a cop mentality preacher
[2:57:58] and some reason people find the
[2:58:00] necessity to try to defend against that
[2:58:03] right really what's happening they're
[2:58:05] battling the same thing themselves
[2:58:07] that's exactly right
[2:58:12] so instead of somebody getting on
[2:58:14] Facebook or Twitter or Instagram or
[2:58:17] whatever and saying here's what the
[2:58:19] prophet said
[2:58:20] first seek ye first the kingdom of God
[2:58:23] it
[2:58:25] I don't have to argue whether the
[2:58:27] prophet was right or wrong seek ye first
[2:58:30] the kingdom of God
[2:58:32] and all his righteousness
[2:58:36] the prophet of God in the seventh seal
[2:58:38] said the bleach of the blood of Jesus
[2:58:41] Christ cast us all it's as if it never
[2:58:44] happened
[2:58:45] [Applause]
[2:58:47] I don't ever see anybody on social media
[2:58:50] saying that
[2:58:55] because it's not popular
[2:58:58] it doesn't win many congregations to
[2:59:01] build a big church but it works
[2:59:04] it works
[2:59:06] that individual that's going through
[2:59:08] those trials you have no idea unless
[2:59:12] you've been there what kind of Torment
[2:59:14] each one is going through
[2:59:18] [Applause]
[2:59:19] brother Brandon said discern the spirits
[2:59:24] not to rebuke them
[2:59:27] not to kick them out of your church
[2:59:30] not to make them feel like there's no
[2:59:33] hope
[2:59:34] but there is hope
[2:59:37] that Daddy does love you
[2:59:41] even though you've done this daddy does
[2:59:43] love you it doesn't matter whether you
[2:59:46] did I don't agree with that
[2:59:48] but Daddy loves you
[2:59:51] because there has to be like The
[2:59:53] Prodigal Son
[2:59:56] he went and killed the fighter cat
[3:00:00] got the best dress on now does that sin
[3:00:02] sound like a father that had disrespect
[3:00:06] that didn't care have perfect love
[3:00:13] on Target's brother wow
[3:00:17] the devil's good at his job
[3:00:21] but God is better
[3:00:25] it works
[3:00:28] it works
[3:00:31] oh praise God
[3:00:33] [Music]
[3:00:39] glory to God
[3:00:42] I want to come to a point and then we'll
[3:00:44] close
[3:00:46] now without getting too involved in the
[3:00:48] subject of the sovereignty of God
[3:00:51] for that would take a book in itself
[3:00:55] let me
[3:00:59] he was honest
[3:01:02] let me point out and I like when he says
[3:01:04] this so so not paying attention he's got
[3:01:06] my attention
[3:01:08] out here that according to these verses
[3:01:12] these verses Jesus Christ is choosing
[3:01:15] his own brother
[3:01:17] just the same as men choose their Brides
[3:01:28] don't pull just hold on let the pastor
[3:01:33] take care of that
[3:01:47] you've got to stop because I keep
[3:01:49] wanting to go there but it's ah
[3:01:54] Lord you take care of this now
[3:01:58] okay
[3:02:01] you don't pull it out of me
[3:02:06] I I let me just say this
[3:02:09] the prophet said
[3:02:11] to us men
[3:02:13] that we have a place in our chest
[3:02:26] now we can move on there's only one that
[3:02:30] can fulfill that imprint
[3:02:33] now he said just as a man would choose
[3:02:37] his bride listen carefully
[3:02:40] the thoughts of God are eternal
[3:02:43] so the election
[3:02:46] [Applause]
[3:02:50] the election was in his mind
[3:02:55] [Applause]
[3:02:57] so before Oh Brother Stephen you have to
[3:03:00] clean this up so before the fall
[3:03:04] [Applause]
[3:03:05] [Music]
[3:03:08] [Applause]
[3:03:09] en
[3:03:11] the Bible invites us to go back to the
[3:03:15] beginning
[3:03:16] there's your quote marriage and divorce
[3:03:19] go back to the beginning because before
[3:03:22] the beginning
[3:03:24] it wasn't so
[3:03:25] [Applause]
[3:03:27] God had an imprint of your help me
[3:03:31] [Applause]
[3:03:35] nobody else
[3:03:37] could fulfill that empress
[3:03:40] nobody else so don't try
[3:03:43] [Applause]
[3:03:45] now how do we know what that imprint is
[3:03:48] go back to the beginning
[3:03:54] when I was one of everything
[3:03:58] uh-huh see it
[3:04:00] the polygamy Spirit crept right in
[3:04:07] yes
[3:04:12] [Applause]
[3:04:17] see if I could write as fast as you I
[3:04:19] could have wrote that
[3:04:28] are you proud of yourselves you just
[3:04:30] pulled me right off of that
[3:04:33] [Music]
[3:04:34] oh
[3:04:40] well that's what he said
[3:04:44] it works
[3:04:47] he didn't say it was going to be a bed
[3:04:49] of roses
[3:04:52] without forms anyhow
[3:04:59] oh we got to stop
[3:05:02] the bride today
[3:05:03] does not simply decide she's going to
[3:05:06] take
[3:05:07] oh
[3:05:13] he said it I didn't
[3:05:15] but I just believe it
[3:05:18] amen I can say Amen with a pure heart
[3:05:22] I just believe it
[3:05:26] it's it's really it's really simple
[3:05:29] you just can't operate after the
[3:05:32] beginning because he said he invites us
[3:05:34] to go back look marriage and divorce
[3:05:40] was 90 some percent spiritual
[3:05:48] can I say something
[3:05:50] that's why men with motives will tear
[3:05:54] down marriage and divorce
[3:05:58] because they don't
[3:06:03] they can't go back to the beginning
[3:06:07] [Applause]
[3:06:09] their motives
[3:06:12] they're motive
[3:06:14] their motives prevent them so what do
[3:06:18] they do then
[3:06:19] attack it
[3:06:22] let's go no sir
[3:06:25] it's the groom who decides that's it
[3:06:29] the natural types
[3:06:33] and chooses a certain woman for his
[3:06:37] scripture John 15 16. ye have not chosen
[3:06:40] me
[3:06:41] but I
[3:06:44] personal pronoun Prophet would say
[3:06:47] have chosen you
[3:06:51] [Music]
[3:06:52] amen not after the beginning
[3:06:56] but before the beginning
[3:07:00] praise God
[3:07:03] now according to the word of God
[3:07:07] we believe that
[3:07:09] the bride was chosen before the
[3:07:11] foundation of the world
[3:07:16] go ahead my brother
[3:07:18] this choosing of the bride was purposed
[3:07:29] do you see yes
[3:07:32] so the new birth
[3:07:35] according to Paul
[3:07:38] First Corinthians 12 3.
[3:07:41] can call no man can call the Lord
[3:07:45] Jesus Christ without the spirit of God
[3:07:50] so in other words unless that spirit of
[3:07:53] God chooses you
[3:07:56] calls you
[3:07:58] puts a desire in you that's it you can't
[3:08:02] respond to a pure word that's not me
[3:08:05] saying that
[3:08:08] because it's a choosing of a bride
[3:08:14] praise God
[3:08:16] now why why
[3:08:19] that the purpose
[3:08:22] of God according to election
[3:08:26] so there must have been something that
[3:08:28] fell
[3:08:32] related with husband and wife
[3:08:36] [Music]
[3:08:38] amen amen
[3:08:40] I like how brother Stephen says it and
[3:08:43] I'm gonna have to uh to borrow it from
[3:08:45] him this message is yummy
[3:08:52] it sure is
[3:08:58] you can't read it any other way
[3:09:02] the heart purpose the Eternal purpose of
[3:09:06] God was to take a bride of his own
[3:09:09] choosing
[3:09:11] and that purpose was in himself
[3:09:18] we're gonna have to have a part two to
[3:09:20] this
[3:09:22] and being Eternal listen carefully
[3:09:25] being Eternal was decreed before the
[3:09:30] foundation of the world watch carefully
[3:09:34] watch carefully
[3:09:41] before there was ever a speck of
[3:09:43] Stardust before God was God
[3:09:48] is an object of adoration
[3:09:51] and no one was there to worship him let
[3:09:56] me stop you just for one second
[3:09:59] so you see what the devil tries to do
[3:10:02] take the worship and adoration from God
[3:10:07] and put it in yourself
[3:10:12] so there's where I said
[3:10:15] people don't want to be healed because
[3:10:17] it brings attention
[3:10:20] it's a form of worship
[3:10:28] so you may not be bowing down to to an
[3:10:30] idol of Lucifer
[3:10:32] but yourself
[3:10:34] full of yourself if he can get you to
[3:10:37] not worship God
[3:10:38] who are you worshiping
[3:10:41] all right here we go
[3:10:46] so he was at the time he was at that
[3:10:49] time only potentially though
[3:10:52] and he was known only as eternal spirit
[3:10:57] the bride was already now you know it
[3:11:00] wasn't me saying it
[3:11:02] the bride was already in his mind
[3:11:05] yes she was
[3:11:07] she was existing in his thoughts
[3:11:11] now in the Physical Realm excuse me in
[3:11:15] the spiritual realm that won't make no
[3:11:17] sense to you
[3:11:19] but if you can just digest this
[3:11:23] and let it drop down into your soul
[3:11:28] it'll come to life
[3:11:31] amen
[3:11:33] so and what about these thoughts of God
[3:11:36] they are Eternal are they not the
[3:11:38] Eternal thoughts of God let me ask you
[3:11:41] are the thoughts of God eternal
[3:11:45] this is powerful watch this
[3:11:57] that's it what a powerful quote
[3:12:01] what a powerful statement friends
[3:12:05] if you can see this
[3:12:10] not with your spirit
[3:12:13] if you can see this
[3:12:16] you will see many things see what
[3:12:19] the eternal
[3:12:21] Spirit
[3:12:23] thoughts of mind
[3:12:26] election of God
[3:12:32] are you ready
[3:12:35] so what did he do
[3:12:38] he sent you almost 1200 messages
[3:12:42] I call them love letters
[3:12:43] [Music]
[3:12:45] to me personally
[3:12:51] he said Dan
[3:12:53] I got something I want to share with you
[3:12:57] amen
[3:12:58] it's my voice that's it that's it I want
[3:13:02] you to hear my voice
[3:13:06] not politic voices
[3:13:09] not Church voices
[3:13:13] my voice
[3:13:16] personally to you
[3:13:18] I'm writing you a letter
[3:13:22] it's gonna be recorded from 1947 to
[3:13:25] 1965.
[3:13:31] I'm gonna make it to where you can even
[3:13:33] put it on a PowerPoint slide
[3:13:36] and share the good news with others
[3:13:43] amen amen
[3:13:45] amen
[3:13:46] you see this letter isn't to anybody
[3:13:49] else
[3:13:53] so when I make it personal then it's I'm
[3:13:56] not making it about me
[3:13:57] I'm making it to me
[3:14:01] so if I'm making his word to me then I'm
[3:14:05] not trying to make anything to you
[3:14:09] you understand
[3:14:12] the lust of the flesh the lust of the
[3:14:15] eyes
[3:14:16] and the pride of life
[3:14:19] it's really that simple
[3:14:22] the choices we make friends
[3:14:25] let's finish this quote
[3:14:28] if you can see this
[3:14:31] you will see many things
[3:14:34] God is unchangeable
[3:14:38] in both Essence and behavior
[3:14:41] we have studied that and proven that
[3:14:44] already God is infinite in his ability
[3:14:47] so therefore he as God must be Omni
[3:14:51] mission
[3:14:53] if he's on the mission
[3:14:55] then he is not now learning
[3:15:03] do you understand what he just said
[3:15:07] it's not like Lucifer is just learning
[3:15:09] you uh
[3:15:11] your father
[3:15:12] knows you
[3:15:16] there's a song that says he knows my
[3:15:18] name
[3:15:20] amen amen amen
[3:15:24] Oh my he is then he is not now learning
[3:15:28] nor is he taking counsel even with
[3:15:30] himself
[3:15:31] nor is he at any time adding to his
[3:15:33] knowledge no sir
[3:15:35] if he can add to his knowledge then he
[3:15:37] is not Omni mission
[3:15:38] the best we could say is that sometime
[3:15:41] he will be
[3:15:45] amen amen
[3:15:48] amen
[3:15:50] amen sure
[3:15:54] Let It Drop just Just Let It Drop amen
[3:15:58] the best
[3:16:00] First Corinthians 12 3 now
[3:16:03] the best that somebody could say yes
[3:16:06] because they don't have the Eternal
[3:16:09] revelation
[3:16:13] if you can see this
[3:16:15] you will see many because they're
[3:16:17] looking from a dead position that's how
[3:16:20] do you hear it yes sir let's close
[3:16:26] but that is not spiritual or scripture
[3:16:28] I'm sorry he is Omni Mission he has
[3:16:31] never had a new thought about anything
[3:16:33] because all his thoughts he has oh he's
[3:16:37] talking to me is he talking to you this
[3:16:39] morning
[3:16:40] he has always had and always will have
[3:16:43] and knows the end
[3:16:46] from the beginning because he is God
[3:16:49] thus the thoughts of God are Eternal
[3:16:52] that's it they are real that's it they
[3:16:55] are not simply like a man with the
[3:16:57] blueprint
[3:17:03] II Timothy
[3:17:06] now he has drawn up and which one day
[3:17:09] will be translated into substance and
[3:17:11] form but they are already
[3:17:17] Eternal and part of God
[3:17:23] so when Dan was doing the things that
[3:17:25] Daniels were doing that's it
[3:17:29] when you were doing the things that you
[3:17:31] were doing those were not the Eternal
[3:17:33] thoughts of God Amen amen amen
[3:17:38] amen
[3:17:40] the Eternal thoughts of you of God were
[3:17:43] election in you so now it's the
[3:17:46] manifestation of the Sons and Daughters
[3:17:49] of God that's exactly right why why is
[3:17:52] it that this time why couldn't it be in
[3:17:53] Luther's time why couldn't it be in
[3:17:55] Wesley's time because that was in part
[3:17:59] yes my brother that was a Reformation
[3:18:01] that's it but it took a restoration what
[3:18:04] does that mean yes sir you go back yes
[3:18:07] for the beginning yes sir yes my brother
[3:18:12] and it took the voice of God yes my
[3:18:15] brother
[3:18:16] it took the voice of God that's my title
[3:18:18] yes it took the voice of God yes said
[3:18:21] take you back to the beginning yes sir
[3:18:24] to Eternity yes sir Christ is a mystery
[3:18:26] God reveals Yes
[3:18:28] Man together if you get a chance listen
[3:18:31] to that message it's amazing
[3:18:34] it's amazing
[3:18:36] the voice of God
[3:18:38] can you say Amen
[3:18:42] praise God
[3:18:44] praise God
[3:18:47] praise God

[3:20:06] something

[3:20:12] pray that you would bring up all I bring
