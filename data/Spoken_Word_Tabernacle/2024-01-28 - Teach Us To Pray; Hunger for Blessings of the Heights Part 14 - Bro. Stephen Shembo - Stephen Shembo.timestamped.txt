[0:00] denominational stuff to him he's got to
[0:03] have Eagles food that's the freshness of
[0:05] the meat not what Moses done not what
[0:08] somebody else done not what sanki finny
[0:10] Knox Calvin but right now the meat
[0:12] that's killed for this day that's the
[0:14] part of Christ that died to make this
[0:16] word be confirmed that's what they eat
[0:18] on get
[0:22] it not what Noah done what Moses done
[0:25] they're examples we seen read what they
[0:26] did but it's what he promised to do now
[0:29] he was was a word back there that was a
[0:31] carcass for that day the day of of uh
[0:35] Wesley was a carcass for that day the
[0:38] day of Luther was a carcass for that day
[0:41] but they don't go back to that that's
[0:43] already contaminated what was left over
[0:46] must be burned to the communion even
[0:48] don't leave it for the Next
[0:50] Generation the Bible said when you're
[0:52] taking the communion what's left over of
[0:54] it don't even let it lay the morning
[0:57] burn it amen so refer back to that no
[1:01] we got fresh food today that's the word
[1:03] that's promised to this hour be made
[1:05] manifest in this hour that's where the
[1:08] Eagles are where the carcass
[1:11] is we can stay a long time on that but
[1:13] I'm sure you understand what I mean all
[1:16] right fifth question will the bride be
[1:19] gathered together in one place at the
[1:22] Rapture and will it be in the west no
[1:27] don't have to be
[1:28] there yeah the bribe will be gathered
[1:30] together in one place that is true but
[1:34] not until the
[1:37] resurrection see for we which are alive
[1:40] and remain until the coming of the Lord
[1:43] Ephesians uh uh uh second Thessalonians
[1:46] the 5th chapter I believe it is we which
[1:49] alive and remain until the coming of the
[1:50] Lord shall not prevent or hinder those
[1:54] which are asleep universally for the
[1:56] trumpet of God shall sound and the dead
[1:58] in Christ shall rise and we shall be
[2:00] caught up together with them to meet the
[2:04] Lord in the air therefore the bribe will
[2:07] all be together when it goes to meet the
[2:10] Lord see it will be together but it
[2:12] don't necessarily mean that we they all
[2:14] have to be set in one place like this
[2:16] because the bride is sleeping in the
[2:18] dust of the Earth around the world from
[2:21] the Arctic to the tropics and from from
[2:24] the East to the west from North to the
[2:26] South Jesus said when the son of man
[2:29] shall appear
[2:30] well I said it it be like the light that
[2:32] shines from the East even into the West
[2:34] the whole thing there will be a
[2:37] resurrection Rapture and away it'll go
[2:40] and before it ever go up to meet him
[2:43] watch the wisdom of the Lord now let's
[2:46] say for instance in talking this I'm
[2:49] saying this through thoughts of Grace
[2:51] and Faith in the word that I say we I'm
[2:55] throwing myself in with you all and uh
[2:58] and with the whole body of Christ Christ
[3:00] universally I I believe that when I say
[3:03] we then I mean by Grace I I believe it
[3:08] by faith I believe it in his grace that
[3:10] we will be among those people that'll be
[3:13] caught up now the first thing happens
[3:17] when we're resurrected the ones which
[3:18] are living will just still remain the
[3:21] resurrection will set in
[3:25] first the resurrection of those that are
[3:27] asleep there will be Awakening time
[3:31] and those which are asleep in the dust
[3:33] now not those that are asleep in sin
[3:35] because they sleep right on they don't
[3:37] awake for another thousand years but
[3:39] those who are are sleeping in the dust
[3:42] will be awakened
[3:45] first and they'll these corruptible
[3:47] bodies will put on
[3:50] incorruption in the rapturing grace of
[3:52] the Lord and then we'll all get together
[3:57] and when they begin to get together then
[3:59] we wish alive and remain shall be
[4:02] changed these mortal bodies will not see
[4:05] death but just of a sudden they'll be
[4:07] like a sweep go over
[4:10] us and you're changed you're turned back
[4:14] like Abraham was from an old man to a
[4:17] young man from an old woman to a young
[4:19] woman what's this Sudden Change after
[4:21] while you you're traveling like a
[4:23] thought and you can see those then who
[4:26] are already
[4:28] resurrected oh oh what an hour then
[4:32] we'll gather with them and then be
[4:34] caught up with them to meet the Lord in
[4:37] the air it's not necessary if your uncle
[4:40] is buried down in Southern Kentucky he
[4:42] has to be brought up in Indiana or a
[4:44] buried in Indiana has to be taken to
[4:45] Southern Kentucky no matter where he
[4:49] is them are dead in the sea shall rise
[4:52] from the sea those that were destroyed
[4:55] in that Arena and eat up by
[4:58] lines those who are thrown into fiery
[5:01] furnaces and not even the bones will be
[5:03] left or the dust they shall still
[5:07] rise whether they was in Rome the arena
[5:10] at Rome or whether they were in the
[5:11] Tropic jungles of the South or in the
[5:13] Frozen regions of the north they'll rise
[5:16] from the dead and be changed and be
[5:19] brought up and the living shall be
[5:21] changed in a moment of twinkling eye be
[5:23] caught up together look at the
[5:24] missionaries has died down there in the
[5:25] fields of Africa look at them has died
[5:28] up there in the in the the Frozen
[5:30] regions of the north look at them that
[5:32] died in the arena all over the world in
[5:35] the Congo all around across the world
[5:37] they've died everywhere in China Japan
[5:40] around the world and the coming of the
[5:42] Lord will be Universal this Rapture will
[5:45] watch the changing there will be two in
[5:48] the bed I'll take one and leave one the
[5:51] same moment there will be two in the
[5:52] field I'll take on leave one one on the
[5:55] dark side of the earth and one on the
[5:56] light side of the earth it'll be a
[5:58] universal Rapture yes the church will
[6:01] all be together but after after the
[6:06] resurrection and uh Rapture has set in
[6:10] now if that is not way you see it well
[6:13] that's all right now I'm not exactly
[6:15] talking I say that we're taping this you
[6:17] see and it might be other ministers who
[6:19] disagree with that that's all right dear
[6:22] brother brandham my question is on
[6:26] baptism when is a person saved
[6:31] I have heard it was when a person
[6:35] believed some say that when you receive
[6:38] the Holy Ghost you are
[6:40] saved even though you haven't been
[6:43] baptized in water as in the case of
[6:47] Cornelius at acts
[6:50] 10:47 some say Paul was saved on the
[6:53] road to
[6:55] Damascus but in Acts

[1:01:29] amen glory to
[1:01:32] God good to see you sister
[1:01:37] Chambers and welcome again to spoken
[1:01:40] word
[1:01:41] Tabernacle the Bible says speaking about
[1:01:43] Israel he says
[1:01:46] behold the people shall rise up as a
[1:01:51] what a great
[1:01:52] lion let me see
[1:01:54] okay as a great
[1:01:59] lion you need to stay tight because I
[1:02:02] will get to an Avenue and we take off
[1:02:05] amen he said the people shall rise up as
[1:02:08] a great lion and lift up himself as a
[1:02:12] Young Lion he shall not lie down until
[1:02:16] he does what eat of the prey you might
[1:02:18] be seated so this lion eat flesh we know
[1:02:23] that eat
[1:02:25] flesh from a
[1:02:27] prey amen shall eat of the prey Kama and
[1:02:32] do what drink the blood of the
[1:02:35] slain we clear so the lion eat flesh and
[1:02:39] do what drink the blood of the
[1:02:43] slame is my Bible different than
[1:02:46] yours a lion has two
[1:02:49] diet the lion can eat the Flesh and do
[1:02:52] what drink the blood
[1:02:55] it is that save the lord it's coming
[1:02:57] from the Bible so the lion eat the flesh
[1:03:01] or eat the meat or whatever you want to
[1:03:03] call
[1:03:04] it and also do what drink
[1:03:10] blood so the eagle and the lion have the
[1:03:14] same
[1:03:16] diet amen you remember that
[1:03:20] right so the eagle and the lion have the
[1:03:25] same diet the ego eat the
[1:03:29] Flesh and also drink the blood yes
[1:03:34] sir glory to God let's go to job 39
[1:03:38] where we were talking about the
[1:03:41] eagle so today we got another one a
[1:03:45] lion eat the Flesh and drink the
[1:03:49] blood Job chapter
[1:03:53] 39 verse
[1:03:55] 27 if you dare you can say amen yeah
[1:03:59] this is where we will base our thought
[1:04:03] and fly from there the Bible says that
[1:04:07] does the eagle Mount up at your
[1:04:10] command and make her nest where on high
[1:04:14] so the nest of an eagle is never
[1:04:19] below amen an eagle always have a nest
[1:04:24] on high the nest of an eagle yes is
[1:04:29] always on high
[1:04:32] amen amen if you an eagle you know where
[1:04:36] your nest should be not below we must go
[1:04:40] on high we clear we
[1:04:44] clear verse 28 she dwells and abides on
[1:04:50] what
[1:04:52] rock so not only is the nest high but we
[1:04:55] need to know specifically where is that
[1:04:58] Nest Lord that Nest is not in the bush
[1:05:01] somewhere or in a forest somewhere she
[1:05:04] abide in a specific place which is
[1:05:07] called a rock and a rock in the message
[1:05:11] means what Revelation it means
[1:05:13] Revelation and also a rock means Christ
[1:05:17] because Christ was the rock that was
[1:05:19] following
[1:05:20] Israel we gave you the scripture on that
[1:05:22] amen so she dwell and abide on the Rock
[1:05:29] upon the
[1:05:30] Water the CRA of the rock do you know
[1:05:33] what it means the crack is the
[1:05:37] peak so the if if you have uh a mountain
[1:05:42] like this the eagle won't put a nest
[1:05:46] here the eagle will not put a nest here
[1:05:49] the eagle will go all the way to the
[1:05:53] peak there amen right that's where the
[1:05:56] eagle put the nest there where he looks
[1:05:59] like a
[1:06:02] pyramid amen so the ego goes to the
[1:06:08] peak which is called the
[1:06:10] crck or the cliff or the highest part of
[1:06:16] the mountain that's where the eagle put
[1:06:18] a pig um a nest there the Bible says she
[1:06:21] dwells and abide on the rock upon the
[1:06:25] crack of The Rock and the Strong place
[1:06:28] in other words that's where she that if
[1:06:32] you look in another translation the
[1:06:34] Strong place is interpreted as an
[1:06:37] inaccessible place in a place where
[1:06:40] nobody can reach no one no Predator can
[1:06:44] get there at the peak of the rock that's
[1:06:47] where the ego stays there amen so if you
[1:06:50] want to find an eagle according to the
[1:06:53] scripture
[1:06:54] you must go
[1:06:56] high you must go to the
[1:06:59] Rock but the rock must be the peak of
[1:07:01] the rock that's where you're going to
[1:07:03] see that eagle amen so the position of
[1:07:07] an eagle is on the peak of the rock or
[1:07:10] the crack of the Rock
[1:07:13] Amen verse 29 from
[1:07:17] there from
[1:07:20] where from where the crack of the Rock
[1:07:23] from the crck of the Rock from the peak
[1:07:26] of the Rock
[1:07:28] Amen from the crck from the peak of the
[1:07:31] Rock from there she does
[1:07:34] what she seek the pray in other words
[1:07:37] She searches she spes so the eego
[1:07:42] doesn't seek the prey down
[1:07:45] here are we together the eagle doesn't
[1:07:49] seek his pray right here the eagle goes
[1:07:53] all the way to the peak there and when
[1:07:56] he stop on the peak right here this is
[1:07:59] the position that the ego use to see the
[1:08:05] prey in other words the ego have to go
[1:08:09] so
[1:08:10] high to see the
[1:08:16] food are we together the eagle have to
[1:08:19] climb so high on the peak of The Rock
[1:08:23] and from that position that's the
[1:08:25] position he uses or he uses as a radar
[1:08:30] to spy out and to search its own food or
[1:08:34] its own prey amen so the food of an
[1:08:38] eagle depend to the
[1:08:44] height depend to the
[1:08:47] altitude amen the higher the ego goes
[1:08:52] the better the ego can
[1:08:57] see so ego don't search food below they
[1:09:01] search food from on high when they are
[1:09:03] on high on the peak on the crack on the
[1:09:07] Rock that's when they're searching for
[1:09:09] food so the food is found on the
[1:09:14] peak the food of an eagle is found up
[1:09:22] there the food
[1:09:24] is on the valley here amen but for the
[1:09:28] ego to see what's going on in the valley
[1:09:31] he have to go to the peck when it's on
[1:09:33] the peck then the eyes Is 2020 it's
[1:09:39] working because the scriptures say from
[1:09:41] here from The Rock from the peak that's
[1:09:45] where he searches the food so the food
[1:09:48] that search from a Peak from a high from
[1:09:52] the highest point Point that's where you
[1:09:55] can find your
[1:09:57] food if you have not reached that point
[1:09:59] yet you don't see
[1:10:03] good praise God you will catch up my
[1:10:05] friend the Bible says in verse 29 from
[1:10:09] there she seeks the pray and her eyes do
[1:10:13] what Behold a far off so the eyes of an
[1:10:17] eagle see far off where from the crack
[1:10:20] of the Rock from the crack of the rock
[1:10:22] so the crack of The Rock
[1:10:25] here give the
[1:10:28] food and also works for the eyes of an
[1:10:33] eagle amen glory to God verse uh 30 her
[1:10:39] young one also do what suck up blood we
[1:10:43] should have it right there and where the
[1:10:45] slains are you remember

[1:11:21] of the Rock Let's go to Vision one then

[1:29:05] the same diet
[1:29:07] [Applause]
[1:29:08] amen are we together are we together a
[1:29:12] nox cannot drink blood a human being
[1:29:16] cannot drink blood because you're going
[1:29:18] to be a vampire but there is only two
[1:29:21] anointing
[1:29:22] that can handle the Flesh and that can
[1:29:25] also drink the blood that anointing
[1:29:28] started at the beginning and the other
[1:29:31] one is cing the
[1:29:34] amen are we together have I lost
[1:29:37] somebody glory to God before the lion
[1:29:41] anointing started in the age of Ephesus
[1:29:44] the ministry that follow that was the
[1:29:47] ministry of Christ himself Christ as the
[1:29:51] son of am men
[1:29:53] amen everybody okay and brother Bram say
[1:29:57] everything that was in God he pulled
[1:29:59] away in Christ and everything that was
[1:30:02] in Christ he P where he he be ped that
[1:30:06] in the church on the day of Pentecost so
[1:30:10] what the church receive on the day of
[1:30:12] Pentecost is an anointing that came from
[1:30:16] the son of man
[1:30:17] amen amen are you following me if a son
[1:30:22] man is sending an
[1:30:24] anointing everybody okay you must be
[1:30:27] careful who's there to be a
[1:30:29] goalkeeper to catch that
[1:30:34] anointing a teacher cannot catch that
[1:30:37] anointing an evangelist cannot catch
[1:30:40] that anointing a pastor cannot catch
[1:30:43] that anointing that anointing goes to
[1:30:45] son of man from son of man to son of man
[1:30:50] so the one who m be a messenger must be
[1:30:53] a son of man
[1:30:57] am everybody okay what I'm trying to say
[1:31:01] is the messenger to this age must be a
[1:31:06] prophet because the anointing coming up
[1:31:10] is coming from a prophet only a prophet
[1:31:13] has an ability to catch a
[1:31:16] [Applause]
[1:31:19] prophet everybody together
[1:31:24] let's go my friend let's read this in
[1:31:27] the fifth year brother Bram says this
[1:31:30] that when that Antichrist was doing what
[1:31:32] riding with his false teaching with his
[1:31:35] false teaching God sent his what
[1:31:37] teaching out so God have to send a
[1:31:40] teacher but that teacher must be a
[1:31:43] prophet amen that's why Paul was a
[1:31:46] teacher and a prophet
[1:31:49] amen glory to God Amen H let's go to the
[1:31:53] book of
[1:31:56] act
[1:31:58] Hall we got a new generation my
[1:32:02] friend where did Brother Bram is brother
[1:32:05] Bram say Paul is a prophet brother Bram
[1:32:07] say Paul is a prophet where is that
[1:32:10] written in the
[1:32:11] Bible
[1:32:13] amen if you thereare you can say amen
[1:32:16] amen act chapter 13 I want to nail this
[1:32:20] it's a kind of quick r you if you dare
[1:32:22] you can say amen amen now they were in
[1:32:25] the church that was where at Antioch
[1:32:29] certain what prophets and what teachers
[1:32:33] so these people are what prophet prophet
[1:32:35] and what
[1:32:37] teachers are we clear yes sir we need to
[1:32:40] know them okay these people are prophet
[1:32:44] and what teachers if you find them they
[1:32:47] prophet and teacher who are they amen
[1:32:50] amen as who Barnabas and the second one
[1:32:53] Simeon and the third one Niger
[1:32:58] Simeon called Niger and the third one
[1:33:01] Lucius of sirene and then who Manion and
[1:33:05] then who that's which had been brought
[1:33:08] man which has been brought up with who
[1:33:11] Herod Herod the chch and
[1:33:14] who that's it so Saul is a prophet and a
[1:33:20] teacher but let me clarify the S jum to
[1:33:24] verse
[1:33:25] 9 so we make sure we get it correct
[1:33:29] thing glory to God you verse n then who
[1:33:35] who also was called who so Paul is Saul
[1:33:39] everybody clear yes sir so Paul is both
[1:33:42] a teacher and he's also a prophet amen
[1:33:46] and brother Bram is saying here that
[1:33:48] when the Antichrist was riding with his
[1:33:51] fault teaching God sent this teaching
[1:33:54] out he sent what word the word the what
[1:33:59] the lion of the tribe of Judah give him
[1:34:00] more volume my friend the lion of the
[1:34:03] tribe of Judah which is the word made
[1:34:07] manifest in the Holy Spirit and the Holy
[1:34:10] Spirit there to manifest himself which
[1:34:13] is the what word that is the reason the
[1:34:17] early church had what healing because
[1:34:20] the one handling that was a
[1:34:24] prophet amen that's the reason why they
[1:34:28] have what healing healing and they have
[1:34:30] What miracles and they had what Visions
[1:34:33] because the one that was there was a
[1:34:35] prophet and they had power is because he
[1:34:38] was the Living Word in the form of the
[1:34:41] Lion of the tribe of Judah riding out to
[1:34:45] combat that amen now you got it he sent
[1:34:49] his power Antichrist
[1:34:52] God sent his the word Antichrist false
[1:34:55] teaching the true teaching went with it
[1:34:58] to combat it now that was the first one
[1:35:02] now this was the first church Apostolic
[1:35:05] that went to meet him everybody clear
[1:35:08] let's go with the second one in the
[1:35:10] fifth seal in paragraph 141 brother
[1:35:13] brandham say now the first that was the
[1:35:17] first was the lion that r that pure what
[1:35:23] unadulterated word Paul had the pure
[1:35:26] unadulterated word in an anointing of a
[1:35:30] lion amen so everybody that was in the
[1:35:33] first church of Ephesus had to be a lion
[1:35:37] but we are not
[1:35:41] lion amen he says in the days of Paul
[1:35:46] the angel of the Church of what Ephesus
[1:35:49] Paul finding this church being the
[1:35:52] messenger to it remember Paul was
[1:35:54] finding the church at Ephesus became the
[1:35:58] messenger to that church and the spirit
[1:36:01] was in that land was a lion Spirit and
[1:36:04] the lion is the lion of the tribe of
[1:36:07] Judah coming from Christ which is Christ
[1:36:10] and Christ is the word Paul with the
[1:36:13] word for that age amen everybody okay so
[1:36:17] Paul started the Ephesian Church AG amen
[1:36:21] and Paul was both an Ephesian uh teacher
[1:36:25] and Ephesian prophet and everyone that
[1:36:28] was under the PA have to behave with the
[1:36:31] anointing of a lion and as an anointing
[1:36:34] of an Ison the first church was eating
[1:36:37] the Flesh of the son of
[1:36:39] man am and the PO and they were also
[1:36:42] drinking the Flesh of the son of man
[1:36:45] that's why the Antichrist could do
[1:36:46] nothing to the first church age amen
[1:36:49] that's why they resisted the niol spirit
[1:36:52] because the one who was there was a
[1:36:54] prophet am but later on he changed from
[1:36:57] a prophet to other people then the
[1:37:00] church fell amen but thank God there is
[1:37:03] another creature amen that was prepare
[1:37:06] for the last one everybody clear
[1:37:09] everybody clear that's why brother Bram
[1:37:12] say there will be another Ephesian
[1:37:15] Church
[1:37:19] AG Hallelujah amen are we together have
[1:37:23] I lost you William Marion Bram he says

[1:37:41] friend there must come a what in
[1:37:44] Ephesians why do we need another
[1:37:45] Ephesian in the end time because the
[1:37:48] first Ephesian was drinking the blood

[1:37:54] word the must come and the son of man
[1:37:58] am are we together are we together he

[1:49:44] that feed by the water the be in other
[1:49:46] word he feed by his mouth he
[1:49:51] and that's a good thing to liken God
[1:49:54] unto the Eagen because God feed his
[1:49:57] church by what his word his word comes
[1:50:00] by what his mouth men shall not live by
[1:50:03] what bread alone but what by every word
[1:50:06] that proceedeth out of the mouth speak

[1:50:20] glory to God listen to this brother Bram
[1:50:23] say the church is starving today for
[1:50:27] some of that word there is nothing will

[1:50:33] place to the eagle amen but the real
[1:50:37] food eego food and we are what Eagles so
[1:50:41] we have to have what eag food not social
[1:50:44] what
[1:50:46] Gatherings not political what speeches

[1:50:52] thisit we must have the eager
[1:50:56] food not political speeches or no some
[1:51:00] what little Stitch and so party but we
[1:51:03] need what some Eagle food said from the
[1:51:06] water mouth of Jehovah Eagle that is why
[1:51:09] he lack us onto what e eego eat eego
[1:51:13] food amen ego do not get social media

[1:51:21] they don't get motivation
[1:51:24] [Applause]
[1:51:27] speaking Glory Glory Glory Glory I think
[1:51:31] that one of the main thing that cause us
[1:51:34] to miss the blessing and remember Faith
[1:51:38] cometh where by hearing hearing what of
[1:51:40] the word of God continue my friend and
[1:51:42] the reason that we miss it is because we
[1:51:44] don't feed on it enough uh-huh Jesus
[1:51:47] says what man shall not live by bread of
[1:51:50] alone but by what every word that
[1:51:52] proceedeth out of the mouth of God Amen
[1:51:55] man shall have his what Daily Bread give
[1:51:58] us this day by the what word of God but
[1:52:01] we try to make it more or what less for
[1:52:04] some of what far off promise way away in
[1:52:08] some other ages but the Bible says now
[1:52:11] amen we are what the sons of God not we
[1:52:14] will be but we are what now follow me
[1:52:17] carefully as we claming brother Adam say
[1:52:20] this we know that sin is unbelief no
[1:52:24] matter how holy we are what we all do if
[1:52:27] we still disbelieve we are what Sinners

[2:03:58] Long snowcat
[2:04:03] Mountain huah and brother Bram say I

[2:04:13] second pool was right there and the
[2:04:15] third pool is the highest one am the
[2:04:17] great lodge but brother Bram say e when

[2:04:43] The Nest where it is
[2:04:47] inaccessible where no pray that you can
[2:04:49] get
[2:04:50] there if you put your nest on the first
[2:04:53] pool denomination will match
[2:05:00] you Lord Lord have we not cast that

[2:05:33] church so the position of the prad is on
[2:05:38] the third pool on the opening of the
[2:05:42] [Applause]
[2:05:46] word a message Church must be based not
[2:05:50] on
[2:05:51] Miracle not on Prophecy but on the
[2:05:56] word Heaven and Earth will pass away but
[2:06:00] the word will never pass
[2:06:03] away if I need to place you on the
[2:06:07] word because that's your
[2:06:10] position that's where no pray that you
[2:06:12] can get

[2:06:17] Capstone
[2:06:19] [Applause]

[2:06:40] preaching how can you help miracle and
[2:06:43] prophecy and women are preaching wearing
[2:06:47] pants amen amen you can't handle that
[2:06:51] one Amen brother Bram says this my
[2:06:54] friend that is what many times that we
[2:06:58] do in the spiritual realm I'm good in
[2:07:00] time my friend very good in time you see
[2:07:04] each day we got to commune with who
[2:07:07] Christ we got to talk with him how many
[2:07:09] days each day we got to settle it with
[2:07:12] him how many days each day Paul say I
[2:07:15] die each day each day I do what I die
[2:07:18] let I live not me but who Christ lives
[2:07:21] in me so if your physical body needs
[2:07:24] food each day and drink each day to
[2:07:27] survive your spiritual body needs what
[2:07:31] spiritual food and what communion with
[2:07:34] the Lord how many days each day to do
[2:07:37] what survive yes Jesus says what man
[2:07:40] shall not live by bread alone but by
[2:07:42] every word that proceed out of the mouth
[2:07:44] of God so each day we got to study the
[2:07:48] Bible
[2:07:49] am not read the Bible you got to study
[2:07:54] the Bible because a ego when he's on the
[2:07:57] word that's when he's pying his food am
[2:08:01] that's when you are looking for the
[2:08:03] promise of the day what is in this Bible
[2:08:07] that God can do for me
[2:08:10] today I'm not reading the Bible because
[2:08:13] brother Steven say read your Bible I'm
[2:08:15] reading the Bible because I'm spying my
[2:08:18] foodall I'm trying to find a cat for the
[2:08:21] day a rabbit for the day a meat for the
[2:08:26] day I need to do some
[2:08:29] hunting a promise that I don't know
[2:08:33] something that I have not reach yet your
[2:08:36] expectation should be
[2:08:38] higher oh
[2:08:41] God he say so each day we got to do what
[2:08:45] study the Bible some people doesn't
[2:08:47] study it at all
[2:08:49] some picks it up every two or three
[2:08:51] times a year but a what a real real
[2:08:55] believer that is how really spiritually
[2:08:57] built up he reads his Bible how every
[2:09:00] day and talks to the Lord that's right
[2:09:03] that's right man shall not live by bread
[2:09:05] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[2:09:08] what out of the mouth of God listen to
[2:09:11] this brother Bram say how many in days
[2:09:15] past and even in this day how they
[2:09:18] misjudge things by not taking it from
[2:09:21] the word of
[2:09:22] God amen amen he says whatever Val
[2:09:27] mistake England made then whatever Val
[2:09:32] mistake they give by giving back Indian
[2:09:35] her rights but they don't realize those
[2:09:38] things because they do not read the
[2:09:43] Bible amen and if that be true among
[2:09:48] nations
[2:09:49] how much more is it among mankind
[2:09:52] tonight who do not value their what life
[2:09:55] how day by day to do what read the Bible
[2:09:59] so if you don't read your Bible every
[2:10:01] day brother Bram say you don't value
[2:10:03] your
[2:10:06] life because your Survivor depend on the
[2:10:09] word it depends on the word of God
[2:10:12] that's where your food
[2:10:15] is brother Bram say and
[2:10:18] and to read the Bible and see what what
[2:10:22] God has laid where in his word for who
[2:10:26] every man and your attitude toward what
[2:10:29] God and toward what his word so the
[2:10:32] eagle when he stand all the way here
[2:10:35] he's not just standing wasting time he's
[2:10:38] standing there spying searching for food
[2:10:43] so when you are listening to the tap you
[2:10:45] are looking for food
[2:10:50] you are looking for something that will
[2:10:53] St your heart for the day so when you
[2:10:57] leaving home you leaving home with a
[2:11:02] promise you living home with a
[2:11:06] [Applause]
[2:11:08] cat this Bible you can read it and read
[2:11:13] it every day but one day you read it you
[2:11:16] see something strick you you say huh and
[2:11:20] you feel like that scripture is talking
[2:11:23] to you that
[2:11:24] day that is your meat for the day you
[2:11:29] need to cling onto it because once an
[2:11:31] eagle see the meat then he take off and
[2:11:35] when he's coming he will get that deer
[2:11:39] and get him have you seen an eagle
[2:11:42] hunting when they get the deer the eagle
[2:11:45] and the deer both are flipping but he
[2:11:47] doesn't leave the meat he's flipping
[2:11:50] flipping until he get it and do you know
[2:11:53] what the eagle does he take his meat to
[2:11:55] the
[2:11:58] height everybody okay if it's a snake he
[2:12:01] pick up the snake and begin to go higher
[2:12:04] the higher the altitude the snake cannot
[2:12:07] breathe
[2:12:09] anymore so take that devil that is
[2:12:13] causing you
[2:12:16] trouble CL with him clim up with him
[2:12:20] clim up with him until he choke before
[2:12:24] you know it you will see him taking his
