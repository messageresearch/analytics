[5:57] seven letters my prophet there's nothing

[6:04] is god unfair
[6:08] god forbid
[6:11] is god unjust
[6:14] do you know who you are
[6:18] that's why you heard brother keep saying
[6:20] all these years you could be dead
[6:23] you could be gone you could be lost you
[6:26] could be dead
[6:27] when you were dancing on the nightclub
[6:30] and if you are dead right there you will
[6:32] go to hell
[6:36] they put you on a ventilator you came
[6:38] out
[6:40] [Music]
[6:43] when you were smoking the devil was
[6:45] unable to kill you because if you are
[6:49] dead right there you go to hell but
[6:51] because of the unmerited
[6:54] the band of predestination
[6:56] [Music]
[6:57] [Applause]
[6:57] [Music]
[7:01] when you dancing in the nightclub god is
[7:04] quiet
[7:05] [Music]
[7:12] do you now know who you are
[7:15] you are more than what you think you are
[7:18] you are the bride of jesus christ
[7:21] and there is no way god is going to lose
[7:25] have you ever thought about god
[7:27] wrestling with moses
[7:30] moses i'm going to send you moses said
[7:31] no i don't know how to speak
[7:33] and god come and say no no no i already
[7:35] provided somebody with you go moses say
[7:38] okay but before i go no you need you got
[7:40] to show me i need to see who am i going
[7:42] gonna tell israel
[7:46] why is god doing everything moses wanted
[7:49] to do
[7:50] in other words it's like it's like god
[7:53] is begging moses
[7:57] gideon are you going there uh-uh i'm
[8:00] afraid
[8:01] okay god give somebody a vision explain
[8:03] to gideon gideon saying i'm still not of
[8:06] the uh convicted okay i'm gonna okay i'm
[8:09] gonna take this flea and put it here if
[8:12] water is there and water is not in the
[8:14] ground and the god say yes i'm gonna do
[8:16] it and kill your comeback again and say
[8:18] no no no let's make a difference put
[8:20] water all around and get why is god
[8:23] pleading he can just kill gideon and
[8:25] create another gideon and use it
[8:31] do you know what i'm saying because in
[8:33] the book of life there was only one
[8:36] gideon
[8:37] [Applause]
[8:39] [Music]
[8:40] and god doesn't have a plan to be on
[8:44] gideon
[8:45] there is only one gideon so he must do
[8:47] everything to convince that gideon
[8:52] [Music]
[8:54] you don't understand me
[8:56] but here if you send somebody else in
[8:59] egypt
[9:01] israel will not be delivered
[9:03] according to the book of life the one in
[9:06] the program of egypt is moses
[9:09] so whatever it takes to convince moses
[9:13] god must do it
[9:16] [Applause]
[9:20] [Music]
[9:22] do you see why he chased you
[9:24] because you have no option
[9:26] [Music]
[9:29] you tried to run he put sickness he put
[9:31] you on the hospital everybody say you
[9:34] die he doesn't let you die your sickness
[9:37] is to whoop you then he hit you back and
[9:39] say understand what i'm saying
[9:43] why he didn't kill you
[9:45] because you have a purpose to fulfill
[9:49] if the quicker you understand that
[9:52] he stopped all the whooping cough
[9:55] [Music]
[9:58] the quicker you understand that oh i was
[10:01] in a car wreck to die that was not dead
[10:04] so there is a language
[10:06] right there
[10:08] you don't understand no i'm not going to
[10:09] church i'm not going to church you run
[10:11] away from church he whoop you he whoop
[10:13] you whoop you you come back again to
[10:14] church but somebody else ran away and
[10:17] they never came back and god don't even
[10:19] care
[10:21] [Music]
[10:26] he have no option
[10:28] do you understand who you are
[10:35] you think i orchestrated to bring him
[10:38] here
[10:39] no it's not me
[10:40] it is him who's watching he says i need
[10:44] on the 24th brother keith from jamaica
[10:47] move on from there because my children
[10:50] are there he need to deliver them a
[10:51] message
[10:57] amen
[11:00] maybe brother keith was going somewhere
[11:02] else
[11:03] and god moved him differently
[11:07] do you understand me
[11:09] do you know that jesus was going to
[11:10] jerusalem and god moved
[11:12] him he said i must need to go back by
[11:17] why
[11:18] did he find a believer in samaria
[11:21] who did he fund in samaria a prostitute
[11:27] because she already have six husbands
[11:29] the seven one is time
[11:32] so god made sure before they crucified
[11:35] jesus that he deal with the prostitute
[11:39] because she was in the plan of
[11:41] redemption
[11:44] the quicker you understand that
[11:47] the quicker you start getting away from
[11:49] the things of the world like brother kev
[11:52] say and you begin to give him your life
[11:54] quickly and consecrate your time and
[11:56] stop foolishness
[11:58] the quicker you're gonna see say that's
[12:00] it that's all i was looking for now open
[12:02] the windows of heaven
[12:03] [Music]
[12:05] god have no other bride
[12:08] but you god have no other option
[12:12] what did he see in you to love you when
[12:15] there are people better than us
[12:18] the angel cannot understand that
[12:21] amen
[12:22] it is a matter of choice i might look
[12:24] back to you but to him i'm handsome
[12:30] anybody here
[12:32] you don't discuss that he it's his
[12:35] sovereign choice
[12:36] amen that's why boaz was locked and
[12:39] could not get married
[12:42] because the wife has to come from
[12:43] somewhere else
[12:46] he had money
[12:47] he had property all he needed was a wife
[12:51] but for some reason he's not getting
[12:52] married
[12:53] because his wife was predestinated
[12:56] until roof come then the revelation of
[12:59] marriage quickened into boaz clear my
[13:02] friend
[13:04] what a privilege do we have
[13:07] to take a minister
[13:09] a great elder in jamaica and move him
[13:11] out of here
[13:13] just for you to understand something do
