amen so you're all welcome and those that are streaming online may god richly bless you amen so if you would let's turn to our bible we thank the musician for everything they're doing and the effort may god richly bless you amen we mentioned something last week [Music] and i say i don't want anybody to be to feel like they are left out amen and i say that if you left up it's your fault what truly we want to mean is we don't want anybody being neglected amen sometime we pick what is going on with you sometime we can so if something is going on you need any help anything don't hesitate to reach out to me to reach out to the deacon and to everybody it's going to hurt me if i know that someone is in the hospital and we were not aware of it's going to hurt me if i know that you didn't have any money to buy gas to come to the church and you didn't even reach out to your brother not only the pastor to your brother and your sister to express like hey i'm going through something in other words let's be open as a family let's talk as a family making sure we back one another app amen and the second thing i have to mention this because we might we need to be considerate sometimes the service on sunday are longer than the service on wednesday not even sometime the majority of the time amen we don't have sunday service sunday school we don't have sunday night service amen if we have sunday school we have sunday night it's going to be a different story we only have two services because of the hotel here other churches are already having sunday morning sunday night but it's difficult for us with what we pay in the hotel to come back here sunday night again that's going to be a lot on us but we only have one service on sunday no sunday school no sunday night so if please we can make a little sacrifice and let's make sure we are grounded in the world the hour is late the president is shooting for a shutdown if they shut down you won't even have to worry about being here you're going to be at home probably you have to listen to your own tape amen so while the hour is here something is burning yearning within me to do the best that i can to redeem the time it's on one service you can please bear with us making sure we're going to be mindful but we don't want to do 30 minutes and we go home you need to be grounded we came out from something that was big we thought everybody was in a message we thought all the young people were in the message and come to find out there were people that were not even in the message they have people that i have even a lot of questions didn't even were not even grounded in the scripture somebody can take the scripture and twist it just a little bit and they are lost can't even think so that really hurt me that's why i say young people you got cell phone get yourself unhooked make sure when we send the reading you are reading those those verses those message thing because we don't want to go through what we went again we don't want anybody lagging behind amen we don't want to pretend like we know the message and we found out we don't even know and no matter how much scripture you're giving somebody doesn't want to understand i don't want to play game again it's a bada war it's a battleground we are in the war amen so if we go a little bit up i'm just trying to redeem the time we only have one service amen we don't have sunday school we don't have sunday night we want to be considerate i just don't want to be like i'm not paying attention to your time it's just something is burning let's be grounded in the word amen because we don't know which wave is coming up again it might come up again within our own frame in a message what are you going to do are you going to try to figure it out again where the brother branham is malachi 4 or not that's a problem amen we're going to bring it in the word until you sit down you say this message is nothing but the truth amen and god might hello allow another wind to come back again to check if you are grounded amen so take this time we don't know what biden is coming with amen praise the name of the lord exodus chapter 17 love you church we don't want to overburden you but i have a responsibility before god and i must make sure i do what is necessary amen exodus chapter 17 verse 18. those who got the reading the text young people you read it all the young people are hooked pretty good amen exodus chapter 17 verse 8 and moses said to joshua you might be seated if you were worrying about he always had me too long so now you're good and moses said to joshua choose out choose us out men and go out fight with amalek this is israel coming out of egypt they had a war with pharaoh something happened with pharaoh and by the grace of god god delivered them they came out crossed the red sea the enemy was destroyed and it seems like everything was fine they were they are heading straight on the highway toward the promised land the first nation the first enemy that attacked israel after the battle after the victory over pharaoh the first nation the first enemy that attacked israel after leaving egypt his name is amalek where are you going with amalek amen tomorrow i will stand on the top of the hill with the road of god i thought it was the road of moses with the road of god in my hand so to fight amalek the battle is with amalek to fight amalek moses must first climb into the hill amen you don't fight tama like any kind of ways verse 10 hallelujah so joshua yeah it's coming it's coming amen so joshua did as moses have said to him notice moses never thought the bible because moses is the type of christ amen the one who engaged in nevada is joshua this is the first time joshua is appearing on the scene and joshua did as moses had said to him and fought with amalek and moses aaron and er went up to the top of the hill so to the top of this hill we have moses there we have aaron [Music] which is delivered amen which represented the levitical priesthood you already know that and we have somebody there called er yes a stranger amen [Music] and he came to pass verse 11 when moses held up his hand so when moses climbed on the top of the hill he was not standing like this he had to put his hand like that with the road of god and brother branham told us that that road was the judgment road so moses went on top of the hill with a judgment stick amen it's coming hallelujah and it came to pass when moses held up his hand that israel prevailed and when he let down his hand amalek prevailed so amalek is not a game amen it depends on what moses is doing amen if moses dropped his hand amalek is wiping you amen so we must make sure the hand of moses are up for you to overcome amalek what is stephen we're talking about este what is wrong with amalek amen verse 12 but moses hand were heavy he got tired and they took a stone and put it under him and he sat there on and aaron and earth stay up his hand so when moses hand got heavy aaron stood and hold one hand and er on the other side we will find we will find out who's here amen throne and aaron and earth stayed up his hand the one on the one side and the other on the other side and his hand were steady until the going down of the sun so air and aaron help the hand of moses to stay up like this amen it seems like the nail of the hand of moses came from aaron and earth come on it's jumping what is the name of the lord verse 13 and joshua disconfited amalek and his people with the age of the sword the word 14 and the lord said to moses write this for a memorial there was something about this battle that god said listen joshua fought this battle i want you to make sure you put this this battle into the law are you there when you are writing the law make sure joshua's story with amalek is written in the law as a memorial i want all israel as the time progress to refer to this battle as a memorial amen write this for a memorial in a book and he hears it in the ears of who he was showing you that joshua already will replace moses right there in the ear of joshua just like esther was put in the best place already showing you she was the queen for i will orderly put out the remembrance of amalek from under heaven so there is something that amalek did to israel that when god look god say put that in the book i will make sure i wipe completely the seed of amalek from undead earth what is inaudible that god hated them so much until god want to make sure no amaleka to remain on earth verse 15 and moses built an altar and called the name jehovah so jehovah nisi speak about amalek among the seven redemptive name of jehovah one of that name contains amalek verse 16 for he said because the lord has sown that the lord not moses not joshua not israel but god the lord will have woe when you look at this world it looks like it's joshua fighting amen against amalek but god is saying that this is not the battle of joshua this is not the battle of moses this is not the battle of israel this is my battle meet the lord the battle is not yours the battle is the lord [Music] amen god is engaged in the battle like david said on wednesday i'm coming in the name of the lord actually it is not david it is god amen because when david threw the stone the jehovah pick up the stone and make sure he drove the stone into the line [Music] put your car in neutral amendment because the lord has sown that the lord not moses will have war with who so this war on generation is gonna be a war between amalek and god amen from what generation to show perpetually generation after generation god will war with amalek until he makes sure amalek is completely wiped out let's go to roman chapter 15 i gave you exodus 17 on the reading so you should be good amen romans 15 verse 1. if you're there you can say amen we then that are strong ought to bear the weaknesses the infirmities of the so among the in the church you're going to have people that are strong and people that are weak and the scriptures say if you strong make sure you watch over the week why why do we need to watch over the week god have a war with amalek what did amalek do to god that god say i'm gonna deal with amalek [Music] and paul is coming he say watch out in the church you who are strong make sure you watch on the week amen and not to please ourself and know the message you know the message help the young people you know the message reach out to somebody let every one of us please his neighbor for he's good to edification not to put them down because they're already weak it is for you to use the word to reach out to them and pull them back up because you are strong for even christ please not himself but as it's written the reproaches of them that reproaches you fell on me he took the burden for whatsoever things were written before time you already know this we're waiting for our learning that we through patience and comfort of the scripture might have hope remember the first feast of king hazaras now the god of patience and consolation grant you to be like-minded one toward another according to christ jesus support one another that you may with one mind and one mouth how can you have one mouth you're speaking the same thing glorify god even the father of our lord jesus christ everybody clear last one revelation 3 then we pray amen revelation 3 verse 10 because you have kept the word of my patience those who remember i believe brother nathaniel preached on this nathaniel barrett on zoom amen okay behold because you have kept the word of my patience i will also i also will keep you from the hour of temptation something is coming up which shall come upon all the world everybody is going to go through this pressure and it's coming already amen to try them that dwell upon the earth so there will be a pressure that's going to come on the world and that pressure will try everybody whether you are christian or not whether you believe the message or not everybody is going to go through that pressure amen verse 11 behold i come quickly when you see that tension when you see the pressure coming up remember the rapture is getting ready amen remember i am coming quickly hallelujah hold that fast which you have what do you have the message of the hour hold fast into the message of the hour when that pressure comes make sure you hold into the message because i am coming quickly hold that first which you have that no what no preacher no man no preacher take your crown let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you for your presence right here in this building and we thank you for giving us an opportunity to gather together when this great temptation is setting up lord to come upon the inhabitant of the earth lord we are committing this service unto the hand father asking you that you come down and speak to us move me completely out of the way lord father let you speak to these people because they come to me not brother stephen but to listen from the lord be the alpha and the omega the beginning and the end of this service father as we committed all in the name of jesus christ amen god richly bless you we are continuing with the king king ahazaris three fists and esther to banquet we spoke about the first feast everybody should know what it is we spoke about the second feast and we finished it up last sunday and we keep we picked up the for uh the third one someone asked me a question this week and i felt led by the holy spirit that i need to stress into something it seems like somebody missed something before we get into that question brother branham say in the hand writing on the wall he says any bible reader here knows that all scripture has a compound meaning every prophecy so not only a scripture but a prophecy some most all of it has a duo a time there or two times or more that it will be answered as a revolving of history in other words history repeat itself what happened in the time of queen vashta happened again today over there they sent seven chamberlain on this time they sent seven angels amen there was a memo there there is a brother branham here history is repeating itself because the old testament is a shadow of the new testament amen history always repeat itself and scripture has a compound meaning to it and a compound revelation everybody clear last sunday when we finished it up with the second feast of king ahazaris we ended up with esther in the house or the custody of hedging and we found out that if you miss the custody of hege which was the top of the holy spirit you're going to go into the tribulation period under the custody of chess gas everybody clear now up here a revelation unfolded of the book of life but before we get into that and stress that a little bit and enter into our subject this morning i want to recall that esther brother david asked me this question and i felt that it's the lord esther first of all was an orphan she was separated from her mother and she also was separated from her father and we know that when we come in this world god uses mom and dad in order to bring you forth in this world so mom and dad represented your natural birth amen but even though you are born from mom and dad no matter how christian they are brother branham explained to us that we are all born in sin shape in iniquity coming into the word speaking lies that's why our children in the message must be born again even though daddy have the holy spirit even though [Music] mama have family believe the message but they must have their own personal experience with jesus christ and jesus when he met nicodemus he told nicodemus you must be born again and nicodemus said wait a minute should i go back again to the womb of my mother or in the womb or oh in the womb of man for nine months again to be reborn jesus said that's not what i'm talking about what i'm talking about is the new birth your father and your mother that birth you that birth was a mess and you must be separated from that birth and be reborn again that's why her father and mother must be separated from her she must be first separated from that first influence that came from her family in the power of transformation brother barnum says sometime you have to separate from everything that is dear on earth her mother was dear to her her father was dear to her but she must separate it from them amen to you to take your position that god has called you to she had to be separated from mom and dad and be transferred under the custody of mordecai which is brother barnum you must be separated from the custody of your natural breath and come under the influence of the messenger of your time because to that messenger was given the message for your day amen sometime the very dearest person on earth you have to shake hand with them and take your position with christ to where god has called you but what is god doing why did he allow mom to die why did he allow papa to die he's transforming you to what she was maybe a daughter or a son or whatever it is from a lovely family sometime like esther but they have to take her away from that family amen like joseph god had a purpose for joseph joseph was loved by his father but god must cause something to happen and to remove joseph from that comfort zone because god have a purpose for joseph amen from a lovely family sometime he blesses you somewhere else because it's the way it's his way of doing it by the renewing of your to obey the word of god regardless of what the price is rebecca have to be separated from mom and dad to go to a husband that she never even saw amen mom and dad want to keep praying for 10 days but rebecca said no don't keep me here i must go i must go to a man that i never seen a man she had to be separated from her family esther have to be separated from her parent sometimes god lets the very props be knocked from andreas the people you are leaning upon the people you have like a backup the people that have your influence more than the word of god that preacher that pastor that you love above the word of god god sometimes removes those crutches because he wants you to be somewhere amen sometimes god let the very prop be knocked from under us sometimes he let sickness struck us he let disappointment heard the extractors sometimes he does that to get you where you will be influenced by the people i have to catch it don't be stupid enough to walk away from it amen i didn't use that word stupid it's a pro word but random music amen be wise enough and understand what god is trying to achieve in your life why did god bring that chaos because you have that chaos as your crutches and god knock off the crutches so you might lean upon himself amen so from the house of the of the custody of a guy we found out that there was a house called the house of women and there was a mystery to the house because that house was divided in two parts one part was the best part and the other part was the regular part and we found out that esther was placed on the best part and every other virgin even though they were virgins they were placed on the regular party and that when that part or the house of the woman was based upon a record when you come your name have to be written when you come your name have to be written but your name is written according to your compartment whether you are in room 20 room 245 room number 20 5 room number 38 but there was one room amen that was a special room and that room was given to esther that's where we unfolded the book of life and i gave you the reading because the book of life contained name amen and based on the category you are in it's gonna orient your life amen the life that you are living right now is all connected under the mystery of your neighbor i will unfold that mystery not unfold but repeat brother branham under that mystery later on amen and we found that that section that was the best part was the lamb's book of life amen thus he gave us four category of people amen the first category was a bread which is the lamb that sheared herself amen and being that the la uh the bread goes into the presence of the king as a bride she's gonna be picked and because the bride is picked she will never go into the house of shaskas that's why brother branham keeps saying and the scripture said that the bride will not go into the tribulation period you are picked and you go into the house of the king amen and when esther was picked we found out that a feast was organized which was the third fist of king a hazaris i'm just stressing this for somebody who missed it amen and that feast was called esther's fist because it's all about the bread which was speaking about the marriage supper of the bread amen after that virgin were called again which we saw was the jews the 144 000 amen the second category was the foolish virgin the foolish virgin will go into the tribulation period but they're gonna be saved they're gonna be safe they're gonna be caught man going to be called by name because the king delighted on them but they're not going to be the bride the third part was the mix multitude that their name was on the record so now when we say that the name is the ways on the book of life it doesn't mean that they take uh an eraser and they erase it the name being erased in the book of life means that your name is gonna be spoken in the history of christianity but there will come a time when it's time to save the people you're going to be missing there amen there is a record of the history of christianity and there is a record of the saved people your name can be here but if your name is not here that's a problem so the foolish virgin their name are here and they are there the name of the bread is here and they are there but the name of the mixed marketed is right here like judah but when you check the book of life where it's speaking about who's going to be saved judah is missing amen because before pentecost judah killed himself he never could make it to pentecost because pentecost gives them eternal life and eternal life was given to them that was ordained before the foundation of the world to be saved does that have the love of the truth amen if you die you are not there it means your name was in the book but your name was erased everybody clear so those will go into the hearts of chess guys and never to be called by the king the story is finished they remain conquer man forever and there was another group that we saw that was never even selected their name was not even written in the book of life that's why the bible says all those that will worship the beast because under the history of christianity they have nothing to do with religion that's why i gave an example you will see somebody born initiated into voodoo or initiated into free medicine or whatever and they get more deeper into it and they become magician and they die magician they've never been in a church they have nothing to do with a church they don't want to go to church their name was not even written in the book of life amen so when you go back again into those uh the house of the women you're gonna find that esther is put on the lem's book of life never to be raised the foolish virgin is in the book of life the mixed multitude is in the book of life they're going to speak about them but after a while their name will be removed they're not going to call them again amen and then there is another category that will never even been involved under choosing amen when god called god will never call them amen some of them they're going to be called and they're going to depart with a falling away everybody clear if somebody missed that one that was your part so let's go to esther chapter three if you need more clarification i gave you the reading in the book of the church in the church book you can review that and lord willing down the road if we have time we will preach on the book of life itself esther chapter 3 if you dare you can say amen few people you there praise the name of the lord now let's buckle up after these things did king ahazarus promote him the son of hamedata the agar guide we already explained to you who herman is the right hand of the king like lucifer we gave you scripture from esther the scripture here is calling him and a naga guide thank you jesus amen and advance him and set his seat above all the presses that were with him that's lucifer above right and all the king's servants that were in the king's gate bowed and reverenced him for the king had so commanded so the commandment to fall down to worship heaven came from the king brother stephen i thought you said that king represented the lord amen okay but mordecai bow not even though it seems like the lord permitted that but mordecai said no there is a great temptation coming up upon the people of the earth begin together okay then the king's servant which were in the king's gate said to mordechai why transgress you the king's commandment it is written in the bible amen why you don't do it hallelujah praise the name of the lord verse 4 now we came to pass i gave you three and four but this book is unfolding i don't even know what to do now he came to pass when they spoke daily to him somebody begin to put pressure on mordecai why is mordecai not trying to bow down or maybe he hated him no no it's a problem heyman is persian he's a jew so he has a prejudice problem it is not about that amen now he came to pass when they spoke daily and how can not to them that they told him to see where the mordecai's mother would stand in other words let's go tell it with him and we're going to see where he's going to stand with his decision whether he's going to stick to his decision or he's going to give away there is a great temptation coming upon all the people of the earth i'm preparing you you better get this we don't know what is coming up ahead amen four he had told them that he was huh so the problem with mordechai is not mordecai i send you reading you remember i told you to read the jew right the jew means what who is a jew amen because the jews were the people of judah amen but paul says that the jew is not the one outwardly it's the one it is not those that are of the flesh that are children of war so paul begin to explain to us that the true jew are christian amen so the problem with mordecai is not a feeling problem it is not a personality problem it is not a prejudice problem the reason why he is resisting a man is because he is jew everybody is bowing is a jew a jew in the scripture it's a genuine christian i send you all scripture amen brother brother and the scripture says when we are dead in christ we became our abraham seed paul speak of it and that which is june is not you what it's not about the country now that by jews inwardly therefore if you are born of the spirit of god you are abraham and hell with abraham according to the promise therefore every promise that god gave abraham is what because spiritually you are abraham we are going slowly i'm still moving the airplane up we already left the airport you are more of a jew than you would be if you were born in the in other words as a christian you have more right than the jewish that are in israel because you are of the royal seed of abraham [Music] amen you are more of a jew because you are a jew that is what born of a promise from which god gave abraham and abraham accepted it by and that is what made him what he so you also by faith you are identified with abraham that's why the jews say we are abraham's seed abraham our father says jesus said if you were abraham's seed you would have liked me too because abraham desired to see me but you are hurting me that means you are not children of who because every seed must reproduce according to its own kind you are of your father there he was a murderer that's why you're gonna kill me on the cross after all a jew is just separation and crossover hebrew and so forth like that now it seems like the state is backing up this commandment combined meaning it seems like king hazares is the one backing up the worship of heaven brother stephen so you mean god is pushing us into this take detroit number 13 we're going slowly amen deuteronomy 13 verse one always bring your bible whether in the ipad i poured i what just bring your bible deuteronomy 13 verse 1. everybody ready [Music] if they rise among you or a dreamers of dreams and give you a sign and a wonder somebody do miracle and the sun or wonder come to pass in other words somebody stand here and prophesy tomorrow this this happened and tomorrow it happened people have a tendency whoa the scriptures say if a prophet says something and what he said comes to pass you must what listen to this prophet but let's relax here amen and the son and the wonder come to pass where of he spoke to you saying let us go after other gods which you have not known and let us serve them so no matter how much miracle this prophet is doing watch him on the word amen watch him on the word if his miracle happened but his teaching is deviating you from god into something else what does he mean verse 3 you shall listen to the word of that prophet i thought god say if a prophet speak something happened listen to him you shall not hearken to the word of that prophet oh that dreamer of dreams for who not satan i'm going slowly the commandment came from king a hazard okay for the lord your god prove you you okay now stay with the message stay with the world [Music] no matter how good the pastor is how good the preacher is if his preaching is not according to the message watch out because it's god proving you it is the lord your god proves you to know whether you love the lord your god we for you and we follow you everybody clear there we clear there so the pressure that comes upon you god permitted but it's a test amen but mordecai you don't follow the king's commandment mordecai said no brother stephen you mean god is doing something like this go to matthew chapter 4. we are traveling now you can unbuckle because i got the altitude the plane is now stable we are not like this now amen matthew chapter four verse one if you're there you can say amen this is jesus the son of god then was jesus led up of the devil [Music] who was leading jesus christ oh so the spirit of god david said he's gonna lead me to green pasture he's going to lead me to steal water that's what david said so if the spirit of god is leading jesus christ it's going to lead him to steal water he's going to lead him to green pasture then once jesus led up of the the holy ghost into the to be what of who the holy ghost pushing jesus christ toward the devil amen amen jesus can say ah it's not me it's the holy ghost that brought me here amen but when the devil came instead of jesus god saying well because the holy ghost brought me here i must leave it alone when the devil came jesus pulled the sword it is written it is written it is written it is [Applause] to written that every christian when you take god and his word you can defeat the devil anywhere anytime under any circumstances why didn't jesus say oh i am led by the spirit so it means that i'm gonna let it go amen young people why did joseph say well if god didn't want me to go to this temptation why did he put this woman around me amen amen joseph said ha even though god permitted that nobody is a humble i'm gonna speak to the world leave me alone leave me alone if you don't listen take my shirt but i'm not going to transgress the king commandment [Applause] amen the commandment was coming from the king hallelujah was only a few years later when the trials come and the church got all shooked up as it's so easy for a congregation of people to do when something john don't just seems to happen the way that it's supposed to be god makes it that way god brings tension into the church not the devil king are hazardous amen the religion of mordecai was not a problem before mordecai was living his life amen but the pressure of the king put pressure on the religion amen the tension that is coming upon you is not pressing you it is pressing the message that is in you amen the world is not israel the war is between amalek and god [Applause] hallelujah praise the name of the lord he let sickness stretch you he let diseases come upon you to do what and to do what to show there god wants to show the people of pleasure that i have mordechai in your midst mordecai was going to walmart nobody knew him nobody knew what he was believing nobody knew his religion people saw him like a good man a good neighbor a good co-worker but when pressure comes then people begin to know about the religion of mordechai no more the name of more the time no more the address of mordechai no more the degree of modicum but the religion of mordecai the is of lord the time hallelujah to show the word that you are truly there i thought people already know he was a jew but god want to show who is the jew amen he permitted by his own will he permitted he permits them to turn against you he promised all those things and turned there to tempt you and he shall do all but take your life there is a limitation in the book of job so much my day will happen in your life not that you won't take my life he could throw you on the bed of affliction he could turn your neighbor against you he could turn the church against you he can do most anything it's god's will for him to do it we are taught that these that it is more precious than god to us but stephen in a message who is this mercy see we have bypassed that brother wanna explain that when jesus was born jesus came from the thought of god into the logos and from the logos in flesh brother branham called this the regular line he said but when me and you we came we bypassed our teopany we left from the thought to flesh that's why we forgot our identity so for god to bring your identity out amen he brings a love to bring the true you out [Laughter] to be what tempted by what like adam but when testing of duh it is not your testing they are not testing you they are testing the message in you hallelujah then we are taken up to this body that we are prepared that was prepared for us before the foundation of the world it is the word there that we skip to come right around down here to be tempted and ah my god take first corinthians chapter 10 hallelujah bear with me my friend first corinthians chapter 10 if you dare say amen verse 13. ah brother robert there was no in other words there is no exception here temptation is included in this verse right here in other words all temptation there is no temptation taking you but such as common to men but god is what who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are so when that pressure comes on you just remember you have something in you that is built to take the pressure [Applause] we are preparing you amen you think the wife you have you have her by any chance pastoria you think that husband you have him for by any chance if they give somebody else that husband she goes to the menstrual institution but there is something in you that can take that man he can go up and down and you still stable you are on cruise control and sometimes you wonder you say how did i live with this man 20 years you were built for that [Applause] [Music] who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able but with that also make a way too that you may be able to so when pressure comes it is a packaging it is a combo not only a combo from the devil but the combo in you let by then bring it on let him bring it on whoever is going to be the president bring it on go to second period [Music] don't be scared don't be scared oh i believe we're gonna go through her damn chill out put your car in neutral you are built for this age you are built for this age hallelujah god could have put you in a different age when god looked at you he said ah this is not for paul ah polycarp paul this uh not arrhenius move forward ah not columba ah no no this caliber not here see that jessie i know now this yes put him there amen let's go to second peter chapter two [Music] this church have a different anointing my god ii peter chapter 2 verse 9 hallelujah let politics fulfill description let them do whatever they want to do you consecrate yourself when the pressure comes watch they turn through them [Applause] amen just chill out is coming they're going to shut the country down come calm down calm i down my wife she look at me you sleeping i say i don't have to worry about anything i'm not sitting on my bed and then begin to think i'm thinking about work tomorrow brother branham said even if jesus is coming this afternoon i will be preparing my sermon god to work ii peter chapter 9 the lord knows how to do what the out of temptation heaven did not know this and to reserve the unjust unto the day of what so we understand here that that pressure came from the king of hazaris now everybody's clear now amen that preacher didn't happen only here because first there was the kingdom of babylon then babylon fell unto the hand of the media and persian as there was under media and persian but if you go back to babylon you find that same pressure again amen they were again jews amen and the king nebuchadnezzar raised an image if you study that image you're gonna find that that image was the image of daniel religious amen like it's the spirit leading you oh it's a prophet so we can bow down to it because the image is the prophet amen it is god putting you into a test and it's backed by the state it's a law mandatory mandatory you hear that all the time a mandate a mandate a mandate they are getting you used to mandate amen to prove who are the true jew amen and what happened let's go to daniel chapter 3. hallelujah praise the name of the lord daniel chapter 3 verse 8. if you dare you can say amen they thought mordecai he didn't want it what did they do they went to accuse him amen daniel three verse eight wherefore at the time certain kill things came near and did what do you see that history repeat itself you remember their accused who mordecai was they accused the jew let me jump to verse 11. and who saw fall down and worship that he should be cast into the midst of the fiery furnace they are certain whom you have set over the affair of the province of babylon shadrach meshach abednego do you think they were the only jews there were many jews why were their names steady because god wanted to show who are the true jew amen there were many jews but not all jews are jew the jew is not outward the jewish minority all kings have not regarded you deserve not your god nor worship the golden image which you have set up then nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring shadrach meshach and abednego then they brought these men before the king they burned this man they put them into the fire when they put them in the fire what happened god showed up amen god never showed up where the pressure started [Applause] amen because he must test you he must prove you to see whether you love him amen he must let abraham go abraham walk abraham take his son put his son tie his son pull the knife not faking with the genuine intention is in his heart to kill isaac when that intention came and was genuine in other words isaac was already killed in the mind of abraham god said stop now abraham i know that you love me amen there was a way of escape there was a lamb that's going to be created by the third pool amen the lamb will be created but before the third could create the lamb you must be pushed to the corner amen then abraham stop it's enough i know i know now you love me now look over there the third pool created the remnant amen god put remember he opened the third pool on the greatest temptation of abraham because when temptation come there will be a way of escape it's not going to be above your power these got into the fire and when they got into the fire god stepping [Laughter] [Applause] shutdown melchizedek are canezza called this man the son of god it's written in your bible amen and brother branham said the son of god means to the lord god the pillar of fire amen shadrach heard about the pillar of fire [Music] meshach heard about the pillar of fire all of them heard but they never seen it it took pressure for them to see the god that they were worshiping amen there is a temptation that is coming upon all the people of the world behold i come i am the kiss at the entrance i am now they look do you know what the fire did to them he only broke the bench that they put because when they put them they were bound the fire just broke the band and they begin to worship and talk with ever talk with god in the fire [Applause] amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah same thing happened to daniel [Music] they went to the lord push the lord make a mandate and then just say they say you know what we're gonna take you to the lions then no problem do you want to change do you want a chance when they put daniel in the lunch then who came the pillar of fire came down [Applause] he never came down when daniel was praying he waited until in the lion then then he stepped there he said now daniel i know that you love me amen praise the name of the lord they told him he didn't listen what did that do to him they went and accused him take matthew chapter 10 hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord when i saw this i said my god no wonder you drifted away from uh the mystery of the two staves because somebody needs a preparation matthew chapter 10 verse 17. if you dare you can say amen [Music] but be aware of who preaching the people in the message the false brethren for they will deliver you up to the council and they will scourge you in their synagogue and you shall be brought before who and kings for my sake for a testimony against because god want to prove to you against them and but when they deliver you up watch the third pool take now put your car in your chair don't even try to figure it out in other words when they are taking you up don't even think when i get there if the judge asked me this i would ask him no you go blank because god is watching you move you move you move you move at a certain time god takes over the period of fire take over but take no thought how or what shall you speak amen shall you speak for it shall be given you in that same hour what you shall what for it is not you [Music] not your battle you are involved into it but it's not you it is not you that speak but who the spirit of your father will speak in the third pool and the brother shall deliver upo people in the message the father the child the children shall rise up against the parent and cause them to be put too and you shall be headed of all men for my name's sake but he doesn't do it to thee shall be what if you stay tight like daniel i'm gonna come you stay tight like shadrach i'm gonna come you stay tight like abraham i'm gonna come it is a guarantee i am coming oh my god the gear is so tight that i don't know if i need to turn to the airport amen so the batter is about a religion not the man your faith is put to test but agag we found out that haman is a nega guide we understand the jew now what is the negative what do we have to do with this take first samia if somebody's failed you shout and we stop and we continue again amen i want you to say whoa he preached three hours didn't preach three hours it's included your music and your song and your song special [Music] take that man it's minus minus then you see your pastor is something [Laughter] first samuel chapter 15 verse 1. buckle up here samuel also said to saul the lord sent me to anoint you to be king over his people over israel now therefore how can you to the voice of the word of the lord can you close that i don't know why is that popping up no no no not the script oh brother david can you close the screen go ahead and click that uh-huh not the second one yes the devil is wasting his time amen that says the lord i remember that which who we okay the first bad i was with who so when saul came god remember amalek because he said put it in the book now i remember malek hallelujah did to israel how he laid wait for him in the way when he came up from egypt so amalek is a spirit that always lays in weight it's important when israel came out of egypt so when you're coming from a trial listen very carefully you need to be taught this when you're coming from a battle when you're coming from a hard situation be careful amalek always lay weight for you why does amalek wait for you after a battle amalek always wait for you to be going through a hard situation when you come out from that battle you are tired that's when amalek approaches be careful jump down to verse three now go and smite the malek and elderly destroy i thought the lord said it was his battle why is he sending soul you see now smite and destroy all that they have and spare not if you notice here god say not only do you destroy a malek but destroy everything that belongs to amalek in other words amalek and his belongings are cursed do me a favor keep your finger right here okay keep your finger right there it's important go to esther chapter now we're going to come back here go to esther chapter 9 keep your finger right there you need to understand this thing because something is coming up you there esther chapter nine keep uh first samuel chapter 15. let's go to esther chapter nine are you there take the first five somebody's still flipping pages you okay roof we okay are you alive you okay okay thus the jews smote all the enemies with the stroke of the sword and slaughter and destruction and did what they would to those that hated them everybody clear job two verse 10 the ten sons of heaven the son of hamadeta the enemy of the jews saluted but under laid not there so when they kill the son of a man they don't touch their belonging i'm going slowly why go to verse 15. for the jew that were in shushan gathered themselves together on the 14th day also of the martha and slew 300 men at shushan but under prey they laid not there everybody clear jump to verse 16. but the other jews that were in the king's province gathered themselves together and stood for their life and had rest from their enemy and slew off their foes 75 000 but they lay not their hand on there why the jews in the time of esther when they are killing the enemy they don't touch their stuff are you there now let's go back to saying i'll give you a test of the future so you remember first samuel chapter 17 verse 3 15 verse 3 now go and smite him like and not only destroy what so the staff of amalek are cursed and that they have and spared them not but slave of what and woman infant and oxen and camel and destroy everything everybody there verse five and saul came to a city of amalek and laid in the valley why is seoul in the valley drop down to verse seven and so smart they are malacat from havilah until you come to sure that is opposite egypt and he took who he took ag king of what heaven was who are we okay now are we okay now the very king of amalek the title of the king of amalek is a gag amen but do you know that the jews are the royal seed of israel you got that agag is the royal seed of amalek [Music] we okay now now the battle of amalek started with joshua god said i'm going to have war with amalek from generation to generation that brother open up with mordechai are we okay now so it is not mordecai and emma is hiding are you there it is god and i am elect fighting praise the name of the lord edgard the king of emma like so it's royal seed striking here his name of the king of amalek let's go to chapter 18. i'm skipping certain things here if you watch the video down you can read it at home chapter 18 verse 15 then probably i'm gonna head to the airport so you suck what you have amen verse 15 samuel is dead soul is in the prophet nobody speaks so he pulled samuel out the reason why they pulled samuel out because he was under the blood of bugs and goat if somebody today is pulled by a witch that person is not saved he is in hell once the blood of jesus christ was poor the devil had no access to believing so you got that caviar let's go to verse 15 and then samuel came up and began to speak to saul he said wherefore when so saw they behaved himself wisely he was afraid of him i'm trying to see where am i maybe i got the wrong scripture brother micah daly if he's there usually he gets me the good scripture amen i might have to give it to you later on but what happened is when when samuel came out samuel when he came out he reminded so that what you did that was wrong was god told you to destroy amalek and instead of destroying amalek you preserve america amen because david had to face them at the amalekite again you thought seoul destroyed them he did it amen now god is against you because of amalek so god hated amalek so much what is in amalek god hates him brother branham help me when joshua enter in the land of canaan don't you let he say don't you let one of them leave if it's a cute little baby a little what oh and i'm all right kill it you remember he shall go to beer namalika he shall pollute the camp and when those little things come back like that disagreeing with the get rid of that we're trying to figure out what is amalek i don't care what denomination it belongs if they are contrary to that word get the thing out of you it is air growing little malachite looks cute looks innocent looks like it's all right brother micah deli but don't you have anything to do with it you stay away from it you just remember an amalekite come on anything that does what are we clear now we clear now that's why god said destroy amalek stay away from it had nothing to do with it at all how many beliefs that's the truth sure it is see stay away from it if it denies the word what is it you are of the devil your father for he is the one that what you okay now amalek lucifer if whatever it takes to begin with and whatever god gives them to begin with that's what he ever remains and the tactics of reasoning is what satan used that's what he ever use is reasoning any enemy that written against or any person any church any organization any individual that was that reason against one punctuation not the word one punctuation of god's word is yours it takes the word to defeat there amalek denies the word because anything that is against christ is what and anything that is against the word is against because christ is though i don't care what it is if it's against god's words be a guest that's you all anything that is against the world is yours our luck is your enemy remember for he said because the lord has sown that their lord will have war with who from generation two so amalek spoke about the devil who incarnated heaven are you there so the battle is not about mordecai and heaven the battle is between god and the devil that's why brother branham preached in the book of faith brother preach conflict between who and who that's the battle hallelujah [Music] but do you realize that there is only two powers in the old universe of all our differences between nation are differences between each other and everything it's all mount up two there is only there is only two powers and two kingdoms and those power is what god's power and every world every disorder everything that comes along it is controlled by god's power all because that is the only true power there is amen this word is not standing in the grip of two great spiritual forces and they are both religious forces and i believe that these great forces are soon coming to ah both of these great forces were represented in the two sons of who keep that in mind because i'm heading to the airport people who follow the pillar of fire will certainly have ah don't worry it's not to be above you but they are ready for that so when that rough time is coming translation also is coming and that damn that's right just ready to go for the lamb overcame them and them that follow him because they were called chosen to the faithful the elected of god the spirit of the world hates the spirit of god and because he can overcome the spirit of the lord he tries to do what destroy mordechai okay destroy mordechai in whom the spirit of the truth because monica is a jew a jew is one who is born again persecution and trials are what put your car in neutral normal part of christian life there is only one thing you can do about them committed them all to judge not and live there out working and final judgment to who put your car in neutral when it comes are you there i will also keep this from the hour of what which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the world the earth this verse is not declaration that the true church will go into the tribulation if it meant that he would have said that but he said i will keep thee from the hour of work this temptation is exactly like the temptation is needed it will be a very inviting proposition held up in direct opposition to god's commandment commanded world because according to the jews you cannot bow before anyone except god amen and yet it seems like it's the king that said it and yet from the standpoint of what human reasoning it will be very it is king of hazards that saved it you see now so enlightening and life-giving asked to fool the world it is coming they want to tell you don't go to church oh no no no it makes sense it makes sense you see they're just trying to do this this god is testing you only the very left will not be full the temptation will come as follows at the bottom the ecumenical move that has started on what seems such a beautiful and blessed principle fulfilling christ's prayer that all might be one religious become so strong politically it's getting a momentum already until america that she bear pressure upon the government to cause us to join with her either directly or through a difference to the principle enough in law uh uh daniel all of them under the law shadrach so that no people will be recognized as actual churches unless under direct or indirect domination of this what it seems like it's a good proposition as this pressure increase abraham taken to the corner daniel taking to the corner shadrach meshach abednego taking to the corner are you there as this pressure increases and it will i'm just telling you it will be harder to resist god is pushing you to the corner but i'm coming quickly are you there for to resist this to lose what and so many will be what to go along it comes from king of hazards for the feel it is better to serve god in the framework of this organization than not to serve god at all but they but they want to believe the devil's lies is to serve satan even though you may want to call him jehovah but the elect will not be what it's going to be a pressure that appear good but it's god testing you let's go to the airport what is going on with family overcomes means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks so we need to understand amalek i'm going to probably touch on two and we later so you can soak in amalek by definition means the dweller in the valley take number 14 and i'm gonna head to the airport now yeah i got my cell phone here and i'm getting ready i tried to put myself on so i stay to bear the weak the the week amen number 14. verse 25 then we're going to head to the airport are you there if you there you can say amen all right yeah that's a good prayer yeah i'm gonna land the plane that's it i got it okay now the amalekite and the canaanite dwelt in there do you remember me telling you that saul was in the valley when he was attacking the amalekite because the american dwell in there remember amalek lay wait when you come out of a battle are you there when you just went through a hard situation a hard experience when you are still in the valley you okay now that's when amalek ambushes you lord help me jump to verse 45 hallelujah jump to verse 45 14 45 go to verse 40 verse 40. and they rose up early in the morning and got them into the top of the mountain saying lo we'll be here and we'll go up to the place which the lord had promised for we have seen a background israel murmur you can read this chapter at home god told israel that moses all the people that murmur novel none of them will enter to the promised land and because the murmur i'm going to leave them into the desert for 40 years and i'm going to kill all of them except joshua and caleb are you there the sin that's why israel say we sin so israel woke up he said ah we sin but lord we're gonna go to the promised land regardless we're gonna go to the promised land watch carefully verse 41 and moses says wherefore now do you transgress the commandment of the lord but he shall not what the lord already rejected you don't try to go in the promised land because you already do not to god verse 42 god not up why father is not among you what now that you might you'll be not smitten before you are remember on verse 25 there are malachite wars in that valley israel sin and israel's presumed brother branham use this for presumption like i'm going to go regardless moses said don't go because your relationship with god is bad god is not in your life don't go let's go to verse 43 why moses for they are malachi you see that and the canaanites are there before and you shall fall by them because you are not you are turned away from the lord therefore the lord will not be with but they did what a venture without authority they presume to go up to the hilltop nevertheless there are the ark of the covenant of the lord and departed not out of there so when israel went to this battle he was lacking three things and i'm gonna land the plane the first thing he lacked god with it you there the second thing he lacked the ark of the covenant are you there which is the word your bible are you there the third thing he lacked moses which is the prophet your message you need god you need the bible says and you need blood random things are we okay israel adventure without god without the scripture without the prophet amalek said i got it watch verse 45 and i land the plane then the amalekite came down and the canaanite which dwelt in the hill and smoicked them and disconfeded them even to what you cannot attack amalek without this element are you there don't fight amalek if god your relationship with god is messed up you must come back to the altar and renew your relationship with god you must reconsequent your life again if you want to resist alex you must come back to the world and you must come back to the message if you want to fight amalek god bless you yet stand here yep 32 i was supposed to stop at 1 30. i'll pass two minutes that's a new discipline let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you for your grace your love your mercy father for giving us opportunity to come into your house lord there are many dangers that is laying ahead difficult and perilous time are coming lord a great temptation really deceiving lord coming upon this world that's going to

color it is a temptation to bring the best out of us it is a temptation that is gonna give us an opportunity that we can surrender our life surrender our will surrender everything and begin to depend completely upon you you spoke to us that you are going to be taken to the governor you're going to be taken to the king do not worry because i will be there you proved to us lord father that you were with shadrach meshach abednego and daniel you were lord father with abraham in his hardest temptation and you proved to us this morning that no matter how much is going to be put upon us we were built for it lord and the hour is coming lord where you want to show who are the true christians who is this bride that have believed your prophet that i have taken your word and buried that word into the heart father thank you for this training that you are putting us on the lord father knowing that the battle is not ours but the battle is your slow father we thank you for this word of comfort we
