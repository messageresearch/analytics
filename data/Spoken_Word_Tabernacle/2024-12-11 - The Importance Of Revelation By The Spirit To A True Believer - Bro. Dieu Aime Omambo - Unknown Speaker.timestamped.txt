[55:27] you all Saints thank you
[55:29] musicians aren't you glad to be in the
[55:32] house of the
[55:33] Lord I was reading the book of um Psalms
[55:37] and I was read I was looking at the and
[55:39] also Samuel looking at David whenever he
[55:43] went he was always happy to go to the
[55:45] house of the Lord and when he came to
[55:46] worshiping God he would always worship
[55:49] with all his might and when I was
[55:51] thinking about that I was like well if
[55:54] David at his time if he would take him
[55:56] to bring him to our time and then we
[55:58] would have like let's say a worship um
[56:02] competition or whatever I truly believe
[56:04] that us would be able to out worship
[56:07] David amen mainly because of the
[56:10] Revelation that we have is greater than
[56:11] the one that he had
[56:17] amen now if we could all go to our
[56:21] scripture I also want to thank the
[56:23] pastor although he's not here
[56:26] for giving me this it's a privilege to
[56:29] be here before the body of
[56:31] Christ amen and I pray that God may be
[56:34] with
[56:38] him if we could all go to Matthew
[56:40] chapter
[56:48] 16:13 now the Bible says in Matthew 16:3
[56:52] says when Jesus came into the coast of
[56:56] kariah kesaria Philippi he asked his
[57:00] disciples saying whom do man say that I
[57:04] the son of man am and they said some say
[57:08] that thou art John the Baptist some say
[57:10] Elias and others Jeremiah or one of the
[57:14] prophets he said unto them but whom say
[57:17] ye that I am and Simon Peter answered
[57:20] and said Thou Art the Christ the son of
[57:24] the Living God and Jesus answered and
[57:26] said unto him blessed art thou Simon
[57:29] bjah for Flesh and Blood have not
[57:32] revealed it unto you but my Father which
[57:36] is in heaven and I say also unto thee
[57:38] that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I
[57:41] will build my church and the Gates of
[57:45] Hell shall not Prevail against it and I
[57:48] will give unto thee the Keys of the
[57:50] Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever Thou
[57:53] shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in
[57:56] heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt loose
[57:59] on Earth shall be Loos in heaven Lord
[58:01] Heavenly Father we come before you Lord
[58:03] Jesus Christ I come before you so you
[58:05] may take me out of the way and just use
[58:07] me Lord God I pray Lord Jesus Christ
[58:09] that the treasure that you put Within Me
[58:11] Lord Jesus Christ that you may bring it
[58:12] out so he may speak and not me Lord
[58:15] Heavenly Father Lord Heavenly Father the
[58:17] hours have come the hour has come for
[58:19] you to speak Lord God I all I did my
[58:21] part Lord Jesus Christ was was reading
[58:23] the scripture and I pray that you may
[58:25] take control and and I pray Lord
[58:26] heavenly father that you may be with my
[58:28] pastor and brother Freddy where they are
[58:29] Lord heavenly father and protect them
[58:31] Lord Jesus Christ so they may come over
[58:33] here I B Remain the service unto you in
[58:35] Jesus Christ's name I pray
[58:38] amen you may be seated now my subject
[58:41] for tonight would be the importance of
[58:45] Revelation by the spirit to a True
[58:48] Believer because the f um the full
[58:51] sentes when in the church age if you
[58:53] look at it it says the importance of a
[58:55] revelation
[58:57] by the spirit to a True Believer can
[58:59] never be overemphasized and that's what
[59:00] I will be speaking today and to start
[59:04] off in the exposition Church age
[59:06] exposition of the seven Church ages it
[59:09] says the time is at hand the time was
[59:11] not at hand previously in the wisdom of
[59:14] the economy of God this Mighty
[59:16] Revelation thou fully know to th th
[59:19] fully known to God could
[59:24] not could not though fully known to God
[59:27] could not come forth heither to thus we
[59:31] immediately learn a principle the
[59:33] revelation of God for each Age come in
[59:37] that age only and at a specific time
[59:40] look at the history of Israel the
[59:42] revelation of God to Moses came only at
[59:46] the specific time of history and even
[59:48] more specifically it came as the people
[59:50] cried onto God Jesus himself came at the
[59:53] fullness of time he being the complete
[59:57] revelation of God of the godhead and in
[59:59] this age Lan the revelation of God will
[1:00:03] come in its due time it will not falter
[1:00:06] neither will it be premature think on
[1:00:09] this and heed it well for we are in the
[1:00:11] end time today and if you notice it said
[1:00:15] that the Revelation when the revelation
[1:00:19] of God when he came to Moses he came
[1:00:20] when the people cried and if you look
[1:00:21] throughout the seven Church ages there
[1:00:24] was a period of time where the Chris
[1:00:26] were being persecuted and it said the
[1:00:28] fullness of the Revelation the fullness
[1:00:30] of God will come and it came only after
[1:00:33] the people cried out after the Christian
[1:00:34] were persecuted and at the last age the
[1:00:37] fullness of it had came now in
[1:00:40] Revelation brother Brenham said he typed
[1:00:42] it to a sculpture when a sculpture draws
[1:00:44] um when a sculpture takes a statue or a
[1:00:48] drawing that he has done and after he
[1:00:50] covers it up and after reveals it again
[1:00:52] that's what brother brandham tpes it as
[1:00:54] a revelation because it is revealing
[1:00:56] what is hidden and he also in the church
[1:01:00] ages if you read your books as brother
[1:01:02] step says read your church age books if
[1:01:04] you read it a revelation is not
[1:01:06] something that could just be explained
[1:01:08] or taught through teaching although
[1:01:12] studying and teaching are good what your
[1:01:13] teachers your pastors and all teachers
[1:01:16] you are good but the
[1:01:18] revelation of Jesus Christ of who Jesus
[1:01:21] Christ is that has to be revealed to you
[1:01:24] by God and it's an individual revelation
[1:01:26] it's not just something that you learn
[1:01:28] off of someone else it's something that
[1:01:29] comes to you
[1:01:32] personally in the in
[1:01:34] 54 the seven Church ages it says blessed
[1:01:37] is he that reth and they that hear the
[1:01:40] words of the prophecy and keep those
[1:01:42] things which are written therein for the
[1:01:45] time is at hand now the scripture gives
[1:01:47] us a start here it is the Revelation or
[1:01:51] the word revelation means something
[1:01:53] that's revealed the revelation of Jesus
[1:01:56] Christ
[1:01:57] given given to John and an angel was
[1:02:01] sent to Bear record or to signify it you
[1:02:04] have to get you have to you have to get
[1:02:07] the spirit of God or
[1:02:10] say or you say I can't understand how
[1:02:13] people say amen get in the spirit once
[1:02:16] that's right because a lot of people
[1:02:17] will be in church and some won't
[1:02:20] understand why other people are shouting
[1:02:22] praising rolling and all that and over
[1:02:24] here it says that if you want to
[1:02:26] understand why people do that you have
[1:02:27] to get into the spirit of God you have
[1:02:29] to be in the presence of God so you can
[1:02:31] feel and sense what they're feeling amen
[1:02:34] and it says that the um in Exposition
[1:02:37] Church it says the Roman Catholics say
[1:02:40] that the church is built upon Peter now
[1:02:43] that is really carnal how could God
[1:02:45] build the church Upon A man so unstable
[1:02:48] that he deny the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:02:50] cursed while doing it God cannot build
[1:02:53] his church upon any man born in in sin
[1:02:56] and it wasn't some rock lying there as
[1:02:59] though God had hollowed the ground at
[1:03:01] the spa and it isn't as the pro the
[1:03:04] Protestants say that the church is built
[1:03:07] upon Jesus it was the Revelation read it
[1:03:10] the way it is written flesh and blood
[1:03:13] that Flesh and Blood hath not revealed
[1:03:16] it but my father have revealed it and
[1:03:18] Upon This Rock which is a revelation I
[1:03:21] will build my church the church is built
[1:03:24] on Revelation on they th save the Lord
[1:03:27] now as I was reading this and uh when I
[1:03:30] reached the point where it says that it
[1:03:31] wasn't built upon Jesus I was a b
[1:03:34] puzzled that was like but because when
[1:03:37] you read it it says read it as it is and
[1:03:38] if you read it as it is it says Flesh
[1:03:40] and Blood he has not revealed it to you
[1:03:42] then it says it was my father who has
[1:03:45] revealed it to you and he said Upon This
[1:03:47] Rock because rock is revelation but
[1:03:50] which Revelation was it because it said
[1:03:52] this Revelation which was the revelation
[1:03:53] of Jesus Christ so I decied to ask um my
[1:03:58] Bishop because I remember Sunday when he
[1:04:02] said that a bishop is someone since he's
[1:04:04] our Bishop we supposed to come to him
[1:04:06] and seek for help you know and me as a
[1:04:09] Christian as a Believer when you give
[1:04:11] out your word like that you give a
[1:04:13] promise I will take it and I will hold
[1:04:14] you to it now the thing is when it came
[1:04:18] to the Revelation I asked him about it
[1:04:20] so he sent me quotes and um citations
[1:04:23] when I looked at it then I remember Paul
[1:04:25] has said that if any man come to you and
[1:04:27] preach to you a different gospel than
[1:04:30] the one that he preached to you if he
[1:04:31] preach to you a different Jesus than the
[1:04:33] one that he preached you then let him be
[1:04:35] a curse let it be a lie you see and when
[1:04:37] I started looking at that
[1:04:39] and um listening to also what my Bishop
[1:04:42] had told me it was that because many
[1:04:45] people also believe in Jesus Christ many
[1:04:47] people believe in the physical Jesus
[1:04:49] Christ and it's not the revelation of
[1:04:51] Jesus Christ it's not just Jesus Christ
[1:04:53] or the man Jesus Christ but it's the
[1:04:55] godhead of Jesus Christ that Jesus
[1:04:57] Christ is the godhead itself you
[1:05:00] see and the and the prophet says in 1916
[1:05:04] in the Patmos Vision it says the
[1:05:06] greatest of all Revelation that mean
[1:05:08] there's no greater Revelation the
[1:05:10] greatest of all Revelation is the deity
[1:05:13] the Supreme deity of our Lord Jesus
[1:05:15] Christ you can't get the first base
[1:05:17] until you believe that walk out that's
[1:05:20] what Peter said repent repent and then
[1:05:23] see the deity
[1:05:25] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:05:27] for the remission of your sins and then
[1:05:30] you you're ready to go in the spirit see
[1:05:32] it says you're ready to go in the spirit
[1:05:34] you can only go in the spirit after you
[1:05:36] repent and be baptized and after it will
[1:05:38] be revealed onto you you see the first
[1:05:41] thing you have to know is the deity of
[1:05:43] Christ I am the Alpha and the Omega I am
[1:05:46] the A to Z there is no more but me I was
[1:05:50] at the beginning I'll be at the end and
[1:05:54] um and it says I'm he that was which is
[1:05:57] and shall come the
[1:05:59] mighty think of it what the trumpet said
[1:06:03] but he said these I am going to direct
[1:06:06] you to send this message that I show you
[1:06:09] who is I'm the first and the last the
[1:06:12] the Supreme one I'm the almighty one and
[1:06:15] I have come to tell you that I'm giving
[1:06:17] you a message to seven churches I want
[1:06:20] you to write it get it ready see the
[1:06:24] seven churches are in Asia now they were
[1:06:28] churches there then with the nature in
[1:06:31] them that represent these Church ages
[1:06:34] today see it says that the greatest
[1:06:36] Revelation there is is the revelation of
[1:06:38] Jesus Christ
[1:06:40] and and as because I remember um what's
[1:06:44] it called as I was meditating because
[1:06:48] when it comes to the the deity of Jesus
[1:06:52] Christ that's like one of my favorite
[1:06:53] Parts in the Bible to like break it down
[1:06:56] and know about it and how it says that I
[1:06:58] the one that was in eternity and brother
[1:07:00] Brandon had also said that God himself
[1:07:03] is eternal God himself is eternity and
[1:07:06] and there's many things hidden into
[1:07:09] there and just by understanding that
[1:07:11] Revelation you would
[1:07:13] know you would know like so many things
[1:07:16] you could do with that Revelation
[1:07:17] because when something is revealed to
[1:07:18] you that mean like I said when when my
[1:07:21] pastor came over here and said oh he's a
[1:07:23] bishop then we supposed to go to him and
[1:07:25] ask him him a question when he brought
[1:07:27] that to me and I understood that I
[1:07:28] caught that Revelation I went to him and
[1:07:30] asked him a question now if you
[1:07:32] understand the revelation of who Jesus
[1:07:33] Christ is that means when the Bible
[1:07:36] comes in and tells you that you are
[1:07:38] God's and you are connected with him
[1:07:40] youall become one with him that mean you
[1:07:42] know exactly what Jesus Christ did what
[1:07:45] is Jesus Christ who is Jesus Christ that
[1:07:47] mean you you'll be able to find who are
[1:07:49] you and what are you you see that's why
[1:07:52] I want to talk about the true a True
[1:07:54] Believer the part of the true believer
[1:07:55] it says now to be a true Christian you
[1:07:58] have to be the same the same as what the
[1:08:01] same as God we don't want to forget that
[1:08:04] all that he was I'm identified with him
[1:08:07] I'm identified with him notice he is in
[1:08:10] me and I in him notice every Christian
[1:08:14] that's a real genuine Christian
[1:08:16] Christian was with
[1:08:18] him was with him when the morning Stars
[1:08:21] sang together the sons of God shouted
[1:08:24] for Joy before their was a foundation of
[1:08:26] the world we were identified in The
[1:08:29] Immortal Realm with God 10 Millions
[1:08:33] years before the world was ever formed I
[1:08:36] was back there with him if I got eternal
[1:08:39] life I was there with him because if you
[1:08:42] look the definition of etern Eternity or
[1:08:44] Eternal it's something that doesn't have
[1:08:45] a beginning nor end that mean if you
[1:08:47] have eternal life in you that mean you
[1:08:49] also don't have a beginning that mean
[1:08:50] when God was eternal when he was Elohim
[1:08:54] you were in him you were his attribute
[1:08:56] inside him you see and and I was
[1:08:59] identified with him when the morning
[1:09:02] Stars sang together and the sons of God
[1:09:05] shouted for
[1:09:06] Joy now over here it says in 1963 Christ
[1:09:10] is the mystery of God revealed brother
[1:09:12] bam says look Christ in you makes him
[1:09:16] the center of revelation of the
[1:09:19] Revelation Christ's life in you makes
[1:09:22] him the center of of the revelation
[1:09:25] Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the
[1:09:27] complete revelation of Christ Christ in
[1:09:30] you makes you the complete revelation of
[1:09:33] the whole thing you see and see God is
[1:09:36] trying to do see what God is trying to
[1:09:38] do what is the new birth you'd say well
[1:09:41] brother brandom what is the new birth it
[1:09:44] is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:09:46] personally to you see you don't have the
[1:09:48] new birth until you get that personal
[1:09:50] revelation see you can't even even when
[1:09:53] you go um you go take the baptism of the
[1:09:57] Holy when you go take the baptism of
[1:09:59] water you're not going to receive the
[1:10:02] Holy Ghost until you get that spiritual
[1:10:05] Revelation by the spirit of God himself
[1:10:07] God has to reveal it to you and once he
[1:10:09] reveal it to you that's when he's going
[1:10:11] to step into you also you
[1:10:13] see not not you joined the church you
[1:10:17] you shoke a hand you done something
[1:10:19] different you say decreed you promise to
[1:10:21] live by a code of rule Christ the the
[1:10:25] Bible he is the word that was revealed
[1:10:27] to you and no matter what anybody
[1:10:31] says what takes place it's Christ
[1:10:35] pastor Pastor priest whatever it might
[1:10:37] be it's Christ in you that is the
[1:10:40] Revelation that church was built upon
[1:10:43] the new birth is Christ is a revelation
[1:10:47] God God has revealed to you this great
[1:10:50] mystery that's the new
[1:10:52] birth and the thing about a True
[1:10:55] Believer because a lot of people ask
[1:10:57] themselves what are a True Believer and
[1:10:59] sometimes you could be leaving in the
[1:11:01] world because lately we've been um going
[1:11:03] through
[1:11:04] the the um our divine record and our
[1:11:10] Earthly record and if you rely too much
[1:11:13] because a friend of mine had asked me um
[1:11:15] what makes you so special than everybody
[1:11:17] else and I was like because he he likes
[1:11:19] accusing me of um being a narcissis so
[1:11:21] he asked me what makes you different
[1:11:23] than everybody else and I was like well
[1:11:26] what makes me different than everybody
[1:11:27] else is the fact that I'm me because me
[1:11:30] being me makes me different then he ask
[1:11:32] me what why do you have so much
[1:11:34] confidence why are you so confident and
[1:11:36] I was like as I was typing he was like
[1:11:39] and don't say God and I was like if you
[1:11:41] remove God out of the equation why would
[1:11:43] I be confident about because God is the
[1:11:45] center of my life God is what makes me
[1:11:47] confident you know when whenever I'm
[1:11:49] facing through trials God is the same
[1:11:51] he's the person that gives me the
[1:11:53] strength to go forward and move forward
[1:11:55] amen because if I if I were to rely on
[1:11:58] my on my Earthly record because like we
[1:12:03] have Americans we have uh Africans and
[1:12:05] all that I remember I was with um one of
[1:12:08] my friends at the store and my friend we
[1:12:10] were talking and after man came in he
[1:12:12] was also African and I could tell he was
[1:12:14] African when he he walked in then he was
[1:12:16] looking my friend because my friend is
[1:12:18] African and he was looking at me it's
[1:12:20] like he couldn't tell what am I if I was
[1:12:22] American or African so he started
[1:12:24] talking to my friend while undermining
[1:12:26] me was still staring at me and as he
[1:12:29] walked away my friend started laughing
[1:12:30] he was like these people don't
[1:12:32] understand they're looking at you
[1:12:33] they're like they they can't understand
[1:12:34] if you're African or Christian I mean if
[1:12:37] you're African or um American and when
[1:12:40] I'm in front of Americans sometime
[1:12:42] they're like I thought you were American
[1:12:44] and sometime they're like well I could
[1:12:46] tell you're African and when I'm with um
[1:12:47] congales they're like well you're an
[1:12:49] American now but that's besides the
[1:12:52] point if I had to rely on those I won't
[1:12:55] I wouldn't even have an identification
[1:12:57] you see but when I rely on my eternal
[1:13:00] when I rely on my eternal my heavenly
[1:13:03] record that mean I can always tell them
[1:13:04] that I am Christian they can always tell
[1:13:06] that I'm Christian they don't have to
[1:13:08] question if I am a Christian or not you
[1:13:12] see and the power of transformation
[1:13:16] because the other thing about Revelation
[1:13:18] the Revelation also brings the Rapture
[1:13:20] you know because the Rapture itself is a
[1:13:22] revelation and even if you look back in
[1:13:26] two Sundays ago when the pastor was
[1:13:28] preaching he had said something he had
[1:13:29] said that the Rapture is a revelation to
[1:13:32] us but to the world is just waiting to
[1:13:34] be manifested and I remember I was
[1:13:36] pondering upon that and I was like the
[1:13:38] the Revelation brings a Rapture and I
[1:13:39] will get into that now brother brandham
[1:13:42] over here says that to be transformed
[1:13:44] which is like the translation to be
[1:13:45] transformed to be
[1:13:47] changed is to be changed and made
[1:13:49] something different like a tadpole it's
[1:13:51] transformed from a tadpole to a frog see
[1:13:54] once he look like a catfish he swims
[1:13:56] around he got a head and his tail and
[1:13:59] everything looks just like a fish like a
[1:14:02] catfish then after a while he begins to
[1:14:04] lose he loses his tail and he
[1:14:08] transformed from one species to another
[1:14:11] you see a True Believer when they're
[1:14:14] growing in their faith they're growing
[1:14:16] in their walk and they're receiving
[1:14:17] Revelation as as the more they grow the
[1:14:20] more they're being transformed you see
[1:14:22] they're losing parts of them until one
[1:14:24] day they will transform into a new
[1:14:26] species a they would have their
[1:14:29] theophany because theophany is like a
[1:14:30] whole different species you see
[1:14:32] different than the one that we are right
[1:14:34] now we'll be one with God now in
[1:14:38] spiritual Amnesia 1964 the prophet of
[1:14:41] God says I was mostly sure with him at
[1:14:44] Calvary I must
[1:14:46] identify I must be identified with him
[1:14:49] at Calvary I must be there to a place
[1:14:52] that where not also was I identi ified
[1:14:55] with him at Calvary I died with him at
[1:14:58] Calvary every Christian must die with
[1:15:01] him at Calvary if you don't die with him
[1:15:04] at Calvary you can't be none of his you
[1:15:07] see I was there when he died I died with
[1:15:11] him and I was there with him when he
[1:15:14] raised up from the dead I came up on
[1:15:16] Easter morning with him in the
[1:15:19] resurrection whatsoever he did I was
[1:15:21] right there with him every believer was
[1:15:24] the same you see even back in eternity
[1:15:27] we was with him you see even when he
[1:15:29] became flesh we were with him also and
[1:15:32] now I find myself in this last days with
[1:15:36] the many with the many of the believing
[1:15:39] Christians identified in his ministry he
[1:15:42] said the same yesterday today and
[1:15:44] forever I find myself in this day
[1:15:47] identified in his ministry do you find
[1:15:49] yourself that way believing it walking
[1:15:52] with it notice the works that he did
[1:15:55] he said the believer would do the same
[1:15:58] the same thing you see that's why I had
[1:16:00] said when my Bishop had said something I
[1:16:02] grab it and the Bible said the same
[1:16:04] thing that he did we will do also and
[1:16:06] anything that God said because the Bible
[1:16:09] says Jesus prayers are yay and amen you
[1:16:13] see everything he prays everything that
[1:16:14] he says happens his word cannot return
[1:16:16] to him void that mean if he says that
[1:16:18] every work that he done you shall also
[1:16:21] do if you just hold on to that that mean
[1:16:23] it will come to reality you
[1:16:26] see and he say you must identify
[1:16:28] yourself with
[1:16:34] him now in the exposition of the seven
[1:16:38] Church ages again it says Christ is the
[1:16:41] true church is the true church
[1:16:44] is Christ in the true church is a
[1:16:47] continuation of the book of Acts but the
[1:16:49] Book of Revelation shows how that the
[1:16:52] Antichrist Spirit would come into to the
[1:16:55] church and Def follow make it look warm
[1:16:57] formal and Powerless it exposes Satan
[1:17:00] revealing his work attempted to destru
[1:17:03] attempted destruction of God's people
[1:17:05] and the dis discrediting of God's word
[1:17:08] right down to the time he is cting into
[1:17:10] the Lake of Fire he fights that he can't
[1:17:13] stand it he knows that if the people get
[1:17:16] the true revelation of the true church
[1:17:20] and what she is what she stands for and
[1:17:24] and that she can do the greater the
[1:17:28] Greater Works she will be an
[1:17:31] invisible Army if they get a true
[1:17:34] revelation of the true Spirit within the
[1:17:36] framework of the of the Christian Church
[1:17:39] By God's discernment and
[1:17:41] withand and withstand the Antichrist
[1:17:43] Spirit Satan will be powerless before
[1:17:47] him before her because the Revelation
[1:17:49] what the Revelation does is just it's
[1:17:51] it's like an Awakening because it's
[1:17:53] someone that's um someone that's
[1:17:56] sleeping in a sense because when someone
[1:17:58] is sleeping you're basically powerless
[1:18:00] there's nothing you can do but when
[1:18:01] you're awake that's when you can
[1:18:02] actually do work you see and when
[1:18:05] something is revealed to you um like
[1:18:08] usually I like to tell my brother
[1:18:10] everything that I can do I truly believe
[1:18:12] you can also do the exact same thing
[1:18:14] physically everything that I can do you
[1:18:15] can also do it now if that if what I say
[1:18:19] to him does if he doesn't receive the
[1:18:21] revelation of what I say to him that
[1:18:23] mean I could be doing something and to
[1:18:25] him it would be like that's beyond me I
[1:18:27] can't do what he's doing that mean to
[1:18:29] certain Christians when God came and
[1:18:31] said everything that I do you can do
[1:18:34] also the reason why they can't do it is
[1:18:37] because they have not received that
[1:18:38] personal revelation to themselves
[1:18:39] because if they received that personal
[1:18:41] revelation to them themselves they will
[1:18:42] also be doing the Greater Works they
[1:18:44] will also be doing what Jesus did and
[1:18:46] greater you
[1:18:48] see and it says no man knows the things
[1:18:51] of God say the spirit of God and he
[1:18:55] and he to whom the spirit of God reveals
[1:18:57] them we need to call on God for
[1:19:00] Revelation more than anything else in
[1:19:03] the world we have accepted the Bible we
[1:19:06] have accepted the great truths of it but
[1:19:09] it is still not real most
[1:19:12] people it is still not real to most
[1:19:15] people because the Revelation by the
[1:19:17] spirit is not there the word has not
[1:19:20] been quickened the Bible says in 2
[1:19:22] Corinthians 5:21 that we have become the
[1:19:25] righteousness of God by our own by our
[1:19:29] Union with Jesus Christ see that mean
[1:19:32] without without us God is Not righteous
[1:19:34] God cannot be righteous without us
[1:19:36] that's what it says that's what it's
[1:19:37] saying over here that mean we're the
[1:19:39] very righteousness of God by God coming
[1:19:41] down and saving us that made him
[1:19:42] righteous you see did you did you get it
[1:19:45] it says we are the very righteousness of
[1:19:48] God himself by being in Christ you see
[1:19:51] it says that he Jesus came in sin for us
[1:19:55] it doesn't say that he became sinful but
[1:19:59] became sin for us that by our Union with
[1:20:03] him we might become the righteousness of
[1:20:06] God if we accept the fact and we must
[1:20:09] and he literally came he literally
[1:20:11] became sin for us by his substitution
[1:20:15] for us then we must also accept the fact
[1:20:18] that we by our Union with him have
[1:20:22] become the very righteousness of God
[1:20:25] to reject one is to reject the other to
[1:20:28] accept one is to accept the other now we
[1:20:30] know the Bible says that it can't be
[1:20:32] denied but the Revelation but the
[1:20:35] revelation of it is missing it is not
[1:20:37] real to the majority of God's children
[1:20:40] it is just it's just a good verse in the
[1:20:43] Bible but we need to have it made alive
[1:20:46] to us and that will take a revelation
[1:20:49] you see like I said a revelation is
[1:20:50] something that will awaken you a
[1:20:52] revelation is something that will make
[1:20:53] you know who you are are because if you
[1:20:55] know you're the righteousness of God and
[1:20:57] you're traveling through trials and and
[1:20:59] you're suffering you wouldn't just be
[1:21:01] down and beat and whatever you will go
[1:21:03] to God you say God you came down to save
[1:21:05] me so why am I still going to trial you
[1:21:07] would tell God that you said that you
[1:21:09] were made righteousness because of me so
[1:21:11] you need to come down and take care of
[1:21:12] me you
[1:21:13] see and it says in the exposition Church
[1:21:16] it says but when the church disbel Satan
[1:21:19] and believes the spirit's revelation of
[1:21:21] the word the gates of hell can Prevail
[1:21:25] against her and in this Revelation he
[1:21:27] tells us what the end of the devil is he
[1:21:30] tells us how he's going to deal with the
[1:21:32] devil and cast him into the Lake of Fire
[1:21:35] he reveals the end of the wicked the
[1:21:38] wicked ones who follow Satan and Satan
[1:21:41] hates that Satan hates the Revelation
[1:21:43] that's why he he always tries to block
[1:21:45] your Revelation through television
[1:21:48] through distractions through little
[1:21:49] minor things that keep popping up Satan
[1:21:51] that's how Satan's block and keeps a
[1:21:53] hold of a child of God you
[1:21:56] see because a
[1:21:58] revelation because if a Christian
[1:22:00] because there's many things that I used
[1:22:02] to he when when people say that oh your
[1:22:06] uncles cursed you and stuff like that
[1:22:08] you see as long as you're in the right
[1:22:11] order as long as you're right with God
[1:22:13] you see as long as you're right with God
[1:22:15] doesn't matter if your uncle curses you
[1:22:16] or even if your father curses you you
[1:22:18] see it's not going to work the only time
[1:22:21] it will work is if you accept it as such
[1:22:24] but if you have the revelation of who
[1:22:26] you are that mean you're not one you're
[1:22:28] not going to accept if you have the
[1:22:30] revelation of who you are and when you
[1:22:32] have that revelation of who you are and
[1:22:33] you don't accept it that's not going to
[1:22:35] happen like brother Brenham said a
[1:22:39] pardon is only a pardon if you accept it
[1:22:41] just like the Revelation a revelation is
[1:22:43] like a pardon to a Believer you see and
[1:22:46] when people are sending curses your way
[1:22:48] and stuff if you have the revelation of
[1:22:50] who you are you will deny it
[1:22:51] automatically you're not going to let
[1:22:53] them affect you automatically
[1:22:55] because there's many people nowadays
[1:22:57] that that will automatically just say
[1:22:59] certain things to you or say oh well you
[1:23:02] can't do this you can't do that who are
[1:23:04] they to say you can't do this because
[1:23:05] the Bible says only God judges the
[1:23:07] Christian only God judges among the gods
[1:23:10] you
[1:23:11] see now earlier I was talking about how
[1:23:15] the Rapture the translation is a is a
[1:23:19] revelation you see and when I was
[1:23:22] reading in the Book of Revelation it
[1:23:23] says I in the spirit on the Lord's day
[1:23:26] because the Lord's Day is when God
[1:23:28] himself comes you see and what happened
[1:23:31] Paul um John entered into the spirit and
[1:23:34] when he entered into the spirit that was
[1:23:35] a type of rapturing because he had
[1:23:37] raptured and he was being revealed what
[1:23:40] uh what is to come you see and heard
[1:23:43] behind him a great voice of the
[1:23:46] trumpet to him to him that overcometh
[1:23:50] will I grant to sit with me in the
[1:23:52] throne even as I I also overcame and am
[1:23:57] set down with the father in his throne
[1:24:00] and immediately I was in the spirit and
[1:24:02] behold a throne was set in heaven and
[1:24:04] one sat on the throne see the importance
[1:24:07] of a revelation the reason
[1:24:10] why Revelation is so important because
[1:24:13] sometime when you read scriptures like
[1:24:14] this you say the throne when you go sit
[1:24:15] in the throne and you're like how can
[1:24:18] two people sit in one Throne you see but
[1:24:20] when you look back when brother Brandon
[1:24:22] was preaching and he said that God
[1:24:23] himself is Eternal God himself is
[1:24:25] eternity and you will even find certain
[1:24:27] part brother BR said that the seven
[1:24:29] Dimension is eternity the seven
[1:24:31] Dimension is God himself that mean when
[1:24:33] you go sit down in the throne what
[1:24:35] happened is the moment you sit down
[1:24:36] you're slide you're sliding into
[1:24:38] eternity you're you're automatically
[1:24:40] going to a different dimension you're
[1:24:42] going into God because God is eternal
[1:24:45] and that's why when people come in and
[1:24:47] they try to look for you once you slay
[1:24:49] into eternity they cannot find you why
[1:24:51] because you're in a different dimension
[1:24:52] than they're in you see that's why even
[1:24:54] when witches and Sorcerers when they
[1:24:57] come seeking for you and they're trying
[1:24:59] to catch you as long as you're within
[1:25:02] the Revelation as long as you're within
[1:25:04] Christ which Christ is eternal they will
[1:25:06] not be able to see you because
[1:25:07] spiritually you have entered into that
[1:25:09] seven dimmension spiritually you have
[1:25:11] entered into Christ into eternity so
[1:25:13] when they're looking at you they cannot
[1:25:14] see you all they see is God himself just
[1:25:17] like when John went up in heaven and was
[1:25:19] looking at the throne he was like
[1:25:21] there's no man worthy in heaven or on
[1:25:23] Earth or under the Earth there's no one
[1:25:25] worthy to take the book but within that
[1:25:28] Throne within eternity came out the Lamb
[1:25:30] of God who took the book you
[1:25:34] see rad undetected on radar and the same
[1:25:39] thing in because the Book of Daniel and
[1:25:41] the Book of Revelation are like parallel
[1:25:42] to each other you see and when I was
[1:25:44] looking at that also it says that he
[1:25:46] also went up in the spirit and he said
[1:25:48] then I lifted up my eye and looked and
[1:25:50] behold a certain man clothed in fine
[1:25:52] lenen whose loin were
[1:25:55] we find we find gold
[1:25:58] of you see and if you look at Revelation
[1:26:02] you look at Daniel you'll see that
[1:26:04] everything that Daniel was doing John
[1:26:07] was also going through the same thing
[1:26:08] and watching the same vision that mean
[1:26:10] if John going into the spirit was a type
[1:26:13] of rapture that mean when Daniel also
[1:26:15] lifted up his eyes he was also in he was
[1:26:18] also raptured his Spirit was raptured
[1:26:20] you see he was raptured by Revelation
[1:26:22] you see
[1:26:24] and in 1916 the Patmos Vision says be
[1:26:28] careful John you've entered into the
[1:26:31] spirit something something's going to to
[1:26:34] be revealed to you what is it a trumpet
[1:26:37] sound the first thing I am Alpha and the
[1:26:40] Omega the first of all
[1:26:42] Revelation that's why the Bible says
[1:26:44] that he is he Upon This Rock that mean
[1:26:47] he's the foundation the first of all
[1:26:48] Revelation he's the foundation of all
[1:26:50] Revelation and that's why it's also the
[1:26:52] greatest that's why the brother BR has
[1:26:53] said it's the greatest of all Revelation
[1:26:56] oh sinner bow repent now before the time
[1:27:00] is too late I'm I'm Alpha and Omega
[1:27:04] that's the first thing that he let him
[1:27:06] know who he was who's who's this
[1:27:09] approaching is this King Jesus king god
[1:27:14] king Holy Ghost he said I am all of a I
[1:27:17] am from A to Z I am the beginning and
[1:27:19] end and I am the immortal Eternal God
[1:27:23] you see just a little later we watch him
[1:27:26] in his Sevenfold person personage watch
[1:27:30] what he is then I am the beginning and
[1:27:32] the end I am the Alpha and the Omega the
[1:27:34] first and the last I was before there
[1:27:36] was a first and after there was no
[1:27:40] there's no more last I'll still be there
[1:27:44] in other words the first and the
[1:27:47] last and I was see concerning this one
[1:27:51] when it says that God is the first and
[1:27:53] the last he is eternal he's Immortal and
[1:27:56] the scripture where it says you are you
[1:27:58] are Gods when God when God say you are
[1:28:01] God doesn't matter even if you're like.
[1:28:04] 1% of God even if you're like 1% of God
[1:28:07] see if God is eternal right because if
[1:28:10] you take 1% of 10 it's like 0.1 if you
[1:28:14] take 1% of 100 it's 10 you see but if
[1:28:18] you take 1% of infinity it's still
[1:28:19] Infinity you see if you take 1% of
[1:28:21] Eternity it's still eternity that mean
[1:28:24] doesn't matter how you look at it you're
[1:28:26] still God regardless because some people
[1:28:28] when you tell them you are God they're
[1:28:29] like no I am not God but 1% of Eternity
[1:28:32] is still God 1% of God is still God you
[1:28:34] [Applause]
[1:28:38] see now in Revelation 5 it says that no
[1:28:42] man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under
[1:28:45] the Earth was able to open the book
[1:28:47] neither to look upon it
[1:28:50] because and I WEP much because no man
[1:28:53] was found worthy to open open the open
[1:28:55] and to read the book neither to look
[1:28:57] thereon and I beheld and I beheld and lo
[1:29:00] in the midst of the throne out of the
[1:29:01] four beasts and in the midst of the
[1:29:03] elders sto a lamb as it had been slain
[1:29:07] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[1:29:11] are the seven spirits of God sent forth
[1:29:13] into all the Earth and he came and took
[1:29:15] the book out of the right hand of him
[1:29:18] that sat upon the throne and and when he
[1:29:20] had taken the book The Four Beast and
[1:29:22] the four and 20 elders fell down before
[1:29:25] the lamb having every one of them Harps
[1:29:28] and golden vows full of order order and
[1:29:32] um which are the prayers of the saint
[1:29:35] which is back to what I was saying when
[1:29:37] John went over there he didn't see
[1:29:38] anyone he he got scared because with the
[1:29:42] judgment and everything happening he he
[1:29:46] he got scared because there couldn't be
[1:29:47] any hope for Humanity until the lamb
[1:29:50] which was Jesus Christ himself which is
[1:29:52] like the fifth Beast that came out
[1:29:54] which was Jesus Christ himself by him
[1:29:56] coming out that gave John hope that's
[1:29:58] when he felt at
[1:29:59] ease now in thirst for Life 195 U
[1:30:05] 57 because we've got his life in Us by
[1:30:08] the new birth and we're just as Eternal
[1:30:11] as God is eternal we cannot perish Jesus
[1:30:14] said he that heareth my words believeth
[1:30:17] on him that sent me have eternal life
[1:30:20] shall never come into judgment but it's
[1:30:24] passed from Death unto life and in 1957
[1:30:27] our faith once delivered to Saints he
[1:30:29] says we believe that God is eternal and
[1:30:32] anything that has a beginning and
[1:30:35] anything that has a beginning has a end
[1:30:37] see and God doesn't have an end like I
[1:30:39] said earlier when if you 1% God then
[1:30:43] you're still God that mean if God didn't
[1:30:45] have a beginning you also don't have a
[1:30:49] beginning and if we could go to Second
[1:30:53] Timothy
[1:31:08] second Timothy chapter 2 verse
[1:31:19] 24 amen
[1:31:24] now verse 24 it says this in second
[1:31:27] Timothy second Timothy it says and the
[1:31:30] servant of the Lord must not strive but
[1:31:33] be gentle unto all men up to teach
[1:31:37] patient in meekness instructing those
[1:31:40] that opposes themselves if God
[1:31:42] pre-venture will give them repentance to
[1:31:45] the acknowledging of the truth and that
[1:31:48] they may recover thems out of the snare
[1:31:51] of the devil who are taken captive by
[1:31:54] him at his will you see if you pay
[1:31:57] attention it says that in meekness
[1:31:59] instructing those that opposes thems
[1:32:01] themselves if God preventure give them
[1:32:03] repentance which is Grace if God gives
[1:32:04] them Grace to acknowledge which is like
[1:32:07] Revelation to have a revelation of the
[1:32:10] truth and that they may recover
[1:32:13] themselves that mean there it's in a
[1:32:14] sense it's kind of like they're coming
[1:32:15] back to them themselves kind of like um
[1:32:19] the the prodigal son coming back to
[1:32:22] himself you see because coming back to
[1:32:24] yourself is a type of Revelation because
[1:32:27] when in this world that we live in
[1:32:29] people are so far gone they're basically
[1:32:32] lost and dead how in Luke
[1:32:35] 15:32 he said that there were that his
[1:32:38] son was lost but now found he was dead
[1:32:41] now alive that mean if you don't have
[1:32:43] the Revelation in you that mean you're
[1:32:45] dead you're lost that mean you're not
[1:32:47] you're out of the will of God because
[1:32:49] God himself is life he is the way the
[1:32:51] truth and the life that mean if you're
[1:32:52] not in God you don't have the revelation
[1:32:54] of God that mean since you're since
[1:32:56] you're not inside God and you're outside
[1:32:58] God that mean you're dead you're lost
[1:33:01] you
[1:33:02] see exactly and it says it was a
[1:33:05] revelation from God that made the
[1:33:07] difference and gave Abel eternal life
[1:33:10] now you might take what the pastor says
[1:33:13] or what the seminar Seminary teaches and
[1:33:17] th it might be Tau to you with eloquence
[1:33:21] until God reveals to you that Jesus
[1:33:24] Christ that Jesus is the Christ you see
[1:33:27] and it is the blood that cleanses it
[1:33:30] that cleanses you and that God is your
[1:33:33] savior you will never have eternal life
[1:33:35] it is the spiritual Revelation that
[1:33:37] gives eternal life and in this day like
[1:33:40] I said a lot of people are lost because
[1:33:43] the Bible says
[1:33:45] that people by abounding in iniquity
[1:33:48] their lovees gets cold you see their
[1:33:50] love gets cold and if you look brother
[1:33:53] brandham said that what is perfect it's
[1:33:56] love and what is love love is God that
[1:33:58] mean that mean if their love gets cold
[1:34:00] that mean they don't have love they
[1:34:01] don't have God God in them gets cold
[1:34:03] that me they they're too they're
[1:34:06] sleeping there's some people their seed
[1:34:08] are end dorant and they need to be
[1:34:10] quickened and some people simply don't
[1:34:12] have it and in this last age
[1:34:15] because throughout the year I had
[1:34:17] noticed there was a theme that was going
[1:34:18] around about first you have to feed on
[1:34:20] the word then I started seeing the
[1:34:23] preachers and ministers started talk
[1:34:24] about marriages and stuff and I was
[1:34:28] wondering why all of a sudden there was
[1:34:31] this little shift that was happening and
[1:34:33] I even noticed when you look in the web
[1:34:35] there was there were people
[1:34:38] promoting marriages in the wrong sense
[1:34:41] and some people were promoting
[1:34:42] singleness and I was just wonder I was
[1:34:44] like Lord God why is this and at the
[1:34:46] same time in our church we started
[1:34:48] having couples meeting and stuff and I
[1:34:49] was like I was still wondering why but
[1:34:52] then till later a friend had U we were
[1:34:55] speaking about shorts and stuff A friend
[1:34:57] had asked me about scriptures about it
[1:34:59] so I decided to do my own research I
[1:35:02] brought the scriptures I brought the
[1:35:03] quotes the quotes and as I was reading
[1:35:05] the quotes brother Brena has said that a
[1:35:08] certain level when your shorts or your
[1:35:11] sces at a certain level it's revealing
[1:35:13] your nakedness and you don't have shame
[1:35:15] you see and in Revelation it speaks
[1:35:17] about how we're naked and blind and we
[1:35:19] can't see and if you look at the age
[1:35:21] that we're living in they're naked and
[1:35:23] they're blind and they cannot see you
[1:35:25] see because a a woman in the Bible even
[1:35:29] in the message if you look at it it
[1:35:30] represent a church it represent a group
[1:35:32] of people and if it says that their they
[1:35:35] their their love gets cold and they're
[1:35:37] blinded and if you look at the
[1:35:38] atmosphere of the world how it's going
[1:35:40] right now that there when it comes to
[1:35:42] marriage and love they don't have it
[1:35:44] they lack it's gone cold and they're
[1:35:46] blinded by lust because brother Brandon
[1:35:49] has said that they're blinded by the
[1:35:51] veil of lust if you read the um the
[1:35:53] message he said they're blinded by the
[1:35:55] veil of lust and because they're blinded
[1:35:57] by the veil of lust everything that they
[1:35:58] do is usually contrary to God and most
[1:36:01] of them they they talk
[1:36:02] about how you you can live by yourself
[1:36:06] but the scripture said that it's better
[1:36:08] for you to have someone to live with
[1:36:10] that way it won't be plain vanity if you
[1:36:12] need a scripture I will give it to you
[1:36:14] that way it won't be plain vanity you
[1:36:16] you can live with someone and it says
[1:36:18] two heads are better than one you see
[1:36:26] Lord excuse
[1:36:29] me because it says it's better to live
[1:36:32] like with a family to with a loved one
[1:36:34] that way you're when you're going to
[1:36:35] work you're going to work for someone
[1:36:37] when you're doing something you're doing
[1:36:38] something for someone you're not just
[1:36:40] doing it haphazardly you
[1:36:43] see exactly and in question and
[1:36:48] answer first um concerning that uh when
[1:36:51] I had read the scriptures concerning the
[1:36:54] shorts and the nakedness and a
[1:36:56] revelation came to me saying that this
[1:36:58] age since he's naked and he has no shame
[1:37:01] what they need is also an Awakening they
[1:37:03] need a revelation because the reason why
[1:37:05] this world is so far gone is because
[1:37:08] they don't have a revelation they don't
[1:37:10] have that Revelation by the spirit
[1:37:13] because you can also have a revelation
[1:37:14] the wrong thing you can also have a
[1:37:17] revelation but if it's not by God it's
[1:37:20] meaningless as the scriptures say
[1:37:22] because you could people can teach you
[1:37:24] people can tell you and you can feel
[1:37:25] like you have a revelation because even
[1:37:28] scientists calls it it's like a Eureka
[1:37:30] moment for them you see but to a
[1:37:32] believer in Revelation changes the whole
[1:37:35] perception on life it changes even the
[1:37:37] way that they talk the way that they
[1:37:38] walk and the way that they act you see
[1:37:40] because when God had came down to
[1:37:42] Abraham and he was talking to Abraham he
[1:37:44] told Abraham be ye perfect and Abraham
[1:37:47] he wasn't Perfect by some intellectual
[1:37:49] knowledge he was perfect by the way he
[1:37:50] spoke because he received that
[1:37:52] Revelation he accepted it and when he
[1:37:54] accepted that Revelation he started
[1:37:56] walking in Perfection you see he started
[1:37:58] walking in Perfection and if we could go
[1:38:02] um really quick because
[1:38:05] in in Matthew
[1:38:08] chapter
[1:38:11] 25 I believe verse 24 it said 24 it says
[1:38:17] that you be perfect as my father is also
[1:38:20] perfect you see but if we could go to
[1:38:23] Matthew chapter
[1:38:26] 24 if we can go
[1:38:34] to actually pardon me I meant to say
[1:38:36] First
[1:38:39] Corinthian 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:38:45] 2 yes sir if you're there you can say
[1:38:48] amen amen 1 Corinthians chapter 2 and if
[1:38:51] you could go to verse starting at
[1:38:55] verse starting at verse six it says how
[1:38:59] be it we speak wisdom among them that
[1:39:02] are perfect ye not the wisdom yet not
[1:39:06] the wisdom of this world nor the nor of
[1:39:10] the prince the princes of this world
[1:39:13] that come to not but we speak the wisdom
[1:39:16] of God in the mystery even the hidden
[1:39:19] Mystery which God ordained before the
[1:39:21] world unto our Glory
[1:39:23] you see when I was reading this
[1:39:24] scripture because I read I read this
[1:39:26] scripture earlier and I was thinking to
[1:39:29] just skip it to just I was thinking to
[1:39:31] just skip this scripture and not put it
[1:39:33] into my note or something like that then
[1:39:36] later on the pastor had came in and shot
[1:39:37] me this scripture he shot me the
[1:39:40] scripture and I was like I guess since
[1:39:42] he sent it to me that's God telling me
[1:39:44] that I need to go back and dig into it
[1:39:45] and reread it and as I was read as I was
[1:39:48] rereading it it says how be it we speak
[1:39:50] wisdom and I decided to look at it what
[1:39:52] did it mean by we speak wisdom and they
[1:39:55] that are them that are perfect it says
[1:39:57] we we preach wisdom and if you look at
[1:40:00] proverb we find that wisdom is Christ
[1:40:02] wisdom is Jesus Christ so it's saying we
[1:40:04] preach Christ among them that are
[1:40:06] perfect which are believers because a
[1:40:08] True Believer is the same as God and God
[1:40:10] is perfect you see we preach we preach
[1:40:14] Christ among them that are perfect yet
[1:40:16] not the Christ or the knowledge or the
[1:40:19] wisdom of this world because people of
[1:40:21] this world they also have their own
[1:40:22] Christ also have their own knowledge
[1:40:24] they also have their own understanding
[1:40:26] and the Bible is saying not the
[1:40:27] understanding not the knowledge not the
[1:40:29] wisdom not the Christ of people of this
[1:40:32] world and it
[1:40:34] says nor of the princes of this world
[1:40:38] that come to n because we find out
[1:40:41] princes are humans because say not nor
[1:40:43] of the humans of this world because it
[1:40:44] says you are Gods you are the children
[1:40:46] of the most you shall fell like one of
[1:40:48] the princes which is speaking about
[1:40:50] humans then verse seven says but ye
[1:40:52] speak the wisd wiom of God in the
[1:40:54] mystery in a mystery then you you preach
[1:40:57] the wisdom you preach Christ the Christ
[1:41:00] of God You Preach Jesus the Jesus of God
[1:41:03] in a mystery yes sir even the hidden
[1:41:06] wisdom which is like the hidden seals
[1:41:08] the Hidden Mysteries which God ordained
[1:41:10] before the world unto our Glory which is
[1:41:13] predestinated which none of the princes
[1:41:16] of this world knew for had they knew it
[1:41:19] they would not they would not have
[1:41:21] crucified the Lord of Glory yes because
[1:41:24] if the princes of this world if if the
[1:41:26] children of Israel knew it they would
[1:41:28] not have crucified Jesus and that Grace
[1:41:30] would not have fall upon us the Gentiles
[1:41:32] you
[1:41:33] see but as it is written I have not seen
[1:41:38] nor Nor Ear heard neither have entered
[1:41:41] into the heart of men the things which
[1:41:44] God have prepared for them that love him
[1:41:48] but God have revealed them unto us by
[1:41:51] his Spirit see it's God revealed
[1:41:53] God is the one who's revealing those
[1:41:55] Secrets those Mysteries he's revealing
[1:41:58] himself because Jesus himself is those
[1:41:59] Mysteries because if you look at the
[1:42:01] Book of Revelation it starts by the
[1:42:03] revelation of Jesus Christ it's himself
[1:42:05] it's God revealing himself you
[1:42:08] see and it
[1:42:11] says but God have revealed them unto us
[1:42:14] by his spirit for the spirit searches
[1:42:17] all things yeah the Deep things of God
[1:42:22] that mean if you're if you find yourself
[1:42:24] longing for the Deep things of God that
[1:42:25] mean you have God in you longing for
[1:42:27] those you see for what man knoweth the
[1:42:31] things of men say the spirit of man
[1:42:35] which is in
[1:42:36] him even so the things of God knoweth no
[1:42:39] man but the spirit of God now we have
[1:42:43] received not the spirit of the world but
[1:42:46] the spirit which is of god that we might
[1:42:49] know the things that are freely given
[1:42:51] unto us you see we're it's the spirit of
[1:42:55] God that's given unto us that makes us
[1:42:57] know God more and by us knowing god more
[1:42:59] we we also learn and know ourselves
[1:43:02] better because earlier as we were
[1:43:04] reading as we were reading earlier it
[1:43:06] was talking about
[1:43:07] how how God himself was revealing
[1:43:11] himself and brother Bren had actually
[1:43:13] spoke about this he said God was
[1:43:15] revealing himself and as he was he said
[1:43:18] Jesus Christ is the revelation of the
[1:43:19] Bible and if Jesus Christ is the
[1:43:20] revelation of the Bible then you are the
[1:43:22] revelation the whole thing and and if
[1:43:25] you read over here it says that we have
[1:43:27] received not the spirit of the world but
[1:43:29] the spirit of which is of god that we
[1:43:32] might know the things that are freely
[1:43:35] given unto us of God see since it's
[1:43:38] freely given unto us and the spirit of
[1:43:40] God is the one that's given unto us
[1:43:41] that's why brother brandham said we are
[1:43:43] the revelation of the whole thing you
[1:43:46] see which things also we speak not in
[1:43:49] the in The Words which men wisdom
[1:43:52] teacheth but which the Holy Ghost
[1:43:55] teacheth comparing scri spiritual things
[1:43:57] with spiritual but the natural man
[1:44:00] receiveth not that the things of the
[1:44:02] spirit of God for they are fool foolish
[1:44:05] for there are foolishness unto them
[1:44:07] neither can he know them because they
[1:44:10] are spiritual discerned they're
[1:44:12] spiritually discerned you see it takes
[1:44:14] the spirit of God to reveal it takes the
[1:44:17] spirit of God to reveal what's in God's
[1:44:19] mind he takes the spirit of God to
[1:44:20] reveal God to you
[1:44:23] Hallelujah but he that is spiritual
[1:44:26] judges all things yet he himself is
[1:44:29] Judge of no man for who have known the
[1:44:32] mind of the Lord that he may instruct
[1:44:36] him but we have the mind of Christ that
[1:44:38] mean we have the spirit of God and
[1:44:39] that's the spirit that's that's
[1:44:41] revealing unto us daily
[1:44:44] am now in question and
[1:44:47] answer um it says there will come a time
[1:44:52] a Time now that the bride will will that
[1:44:55] rejects the the head the head's part of
[1:44:58] the Bride will have to suffer for her
[1:45:01] rejection because the gospel was made
[1:45:04] plain to them back then like it's made
[1:45:07] plain to you today see see it's so plain
[1:45:11] you don't had all of those years
[1:45:15] examples the seals open the church ages
[1:45:18] laid out and everything like that it's
[1:45:21] just so plain you can't miss it see and
[1:45:23] then if you fully reject it there's only
[1:45:27] one thing to do which is suffer that
[1:45:30] mean if you reject the Revelation
[1:45:31] there's only one thing left it's suffer
[1:45:33] because if you look at Cain and Abel
[1:45:36] when God had told them because God had
[1:45:39] told them to give them a give him a
[1:45:40] sacrifice and both Cain and Abel heard
[1:45:44] the same story that that that happened
[1:45:46] to Eden and through Revelation Abel gave
[1:45:50] a better sacrifice through revelation
[1:45:53] was able to please God with his
[1:45:54] sacrifice but Cain wasn't then God came
[1:45:57] down and told Cain be careful the enemy
[1:46:00] is at the door and that was God
[1:46:03] revealing what was to come to Cain but
[1:46:06] Cain did not receive it Cain rejected it
[1:46:08] just like this age is rejecting the
[1:46:10] revelation of Jesus Christ and because
[1:46:13] he rejected it he had to go through
[1:46:14] tribulation he had to go through
[1:46:15] suffering you see just like this world
[1:46:17] since they're rejecting the revelation
[1:46:19] of God they're rejecting who God is
[1:46:22] there will also suffer as the scripture
[1:46:25] says now in the prodigal son I will try
[1:46:29] to close in the prodal
[1:46:33] son of 1950 it says think of my father
[1:46:37] that has all the wealth that he has and
[1:46:41] all things that he has given to me here
[1:46:45] I am laying here dying of hunger laying
[1:46:48] in a hog pan eating the Bible said he
[1:46:52] came to himself
[1:46:53] that mean he he had he received the
[1:46:55] revelation of who he is you see because
[1:46:58] the scripture that we had read it said
[1:47:00] if God give you Grace and after you come
[1:47:02] to yourself you will take yourself out
[1:47:04] of you will free yourself from the devil
[1:47:07] it didn't even say God will come down
[1:47:08] and come and free you you will free
[1:47:10] yourself from the devil you see because
[1:47:12] revelation will free you from the devil
[1:47:14] that's that's why Revelation is so
[1:47:17] important to a True Believer because it
[1:47:18] gives you the power to Free Yourself it
[1:47:20] gives you the power to be like you see
[1:47:24] and it says and that's what the church
[1:47:26] needs to do today to come TOS to realize
[1:47:30] who who is who is your father for
[1:47:34] sometimes we act as though we have no
[1:47:35] heavenly father because if you know who
[1:47:37] your father is that that mean you know
[1:47:39] everything that your father is you're
[1:47:41] also the same thing you're the
[1:47:42] inheritance you're the hair of it you
[1:47:44] see for all the
[1:47:46] goodness of Heaven belongs to the church
[1:47:50] Divine Healing salvation freedom from
[1:47:53] worrying or anything all belongs to the
[1:47:56] church Jesus died and we are we are
[1:48:00] inherit and we inherit all that all that
[1:48:04] God has all that God has through him
[1:48:07] hers of the Kingdom Rich my father is
[1:48:11] rich in in houses and lands that's right
[1:48:14] he holds the wealth of the world in his
[1:48:16] hand that's
[1:48:17] right that's how we are if we would just
[1:48:21] come to ourself or I can see him as he
[1:48:24] began to come to himself and say oh if I
[1:48:27] could just go home but I've sinned and
[1:48:30] I'm no no more worthy to go home so what
[1:48:33] can I do see they the um prodigal son
[1:48:36] had built up a complex because he went
[1:48:38] to the world just like us because we
[1:48:39] were brought up and raised up we were
[1:48:42] birthed in the world we also built up a
[1:48:44] complex that put us in spiritual Amnesia
[1:48:46] you see that's why we we don't that's
[1:48:48] what we need a revelation so we can know
[1:48:50] who we are that's why God had to come
[1:48:52] down reveal himself to us and brother
[1:48:55] Brenham says in question answer of 1953
[1:48:57] he says that he was laying there
[1:49:00] speaking about Adam he was laying there
[1:49:02] I can have many pictures of it I can see
[1:49:04] Adam standing let's take this let's take
[1:49:07] this way see him standing like a tree
[1:49:10] God had made him he was dead as he could
[1:49:13] be his toes like the roots sticking in
[1:49:16] the ground and God said let there be or
[1:49:19] breathe the breath of life into him and
[1:49:22] he jumped he jumped and came to himself
[1:49:25] you see he was a breathed the breath of
[1:49:30] life into him he became a living soul
[1:49:32] and he began to move on and on you see
[1:49:36] he because if you look at look when he
[1:49:39] look chapter 15 when he had said that
[1:49:42] when he had said that my son was lost
[1:49:44] then found he was dead then alive
[1:49:47] because he was he because he didn't have
[1:49:50] the Revelation because he was um he
[1:49:52] forgot who he was he because he was even
[1:49:55] eating the um with pigs where he wasn't
[1:49:58] supposed to be but by him coming to
[1:49:59] himself he came to life and you see here
[1:50:01] brother Brenham saying that by
[1:50:04] um by Adam by the Breath of Life
[1:50:07] entering Adam he came to himself and
[1:50:10] that's when he became alive so if the
[1:50:13] breath that mean the Revelation itself
[1:50:16] when you come to yourself is also the
[1:50:17] Breath of Life entering you you
[1:50:20] see it's also the Breath of Life
[1:50:22] entering you
[1:50:24] yes
[1:50:27] amen
[1:50:35] amen and just trying to close because of
[1:50:39] time in
[1:50:41] 1965 The God Who is rich in
[1:50:44] Mercy brother Brenham talks in paragraph
[1:50:47] 52 all the way to 55 he says I heard a s
[1:50:51] I heard a simil a similar little story I
[1:50:54] hope it don't sound sacrilegious about a
[1:50:57] little dog being born under a h one time
[1:51:01] he couldn't understand a funny looking
[1:51:03] little fellow odd guy and he couldn't
[1:51:05] understand the dust and everything they
[1:51:07] were playing in the barnyard but one day
[1:51:10] the old hand led the little Brad out
[1:51:13] behind the barn and he got a smell of
[1:51:16] water well he took out towards the water
[1:51:19] as hard as he could go why he had never
[1:51:22] been on the pound before he had never
[1:51:25] been in in the water but he was a dock
[1:51:28] to begin with only thing he had to do
[1:51:31] was come to himself you see just like a
[1:51:34] True Believer a True Believer in this
[1:51:36] last age when they come to them
[1:51:38] themselves when they hear the word the
[1:51:39] word will make them come to themselves
[1:51:41] and when they come to themselves they
[1:51:42] will crave for more of the word and they
[1:51:44] will run more towards the word to so
[1:51:46] they can eat more of the word you see so
[1:51:48] God can continuously keep revealing
[1:51:50] himself to them you see
[1:51:53] that's the same thing the believer is
[1:51:56] there is something in him that when he
[1:51:58] meets God face to face he comes to
[1:52:01] himself the seed is in him and it's
[1:52:05] quickened by that's right he flies away
[1:52:09] from the things of the world just like
[1:52:11] John when he would when he entered into
[1:52:13] the spirit he flew away from the things
[1:52:15] of the world you see he flies away from
[1:52:18] the things of the world they be they
[1:52:20] become dead to him you see my I remember
[1:52:23] we all had our life in the past in those
[1:52:26] things of the world but once we got a
[1:52:29] hold of the real thing something that
[1:52:32] quickened us a little seed that come to
[1:52:36] life then all the things of the world
[1:52:39] rotted right there we had no more desire
[1:52:43] of it you see because when you receive
[1:52:45] the the Revelation by the Holy Spirit
[1:52:48] the desire of the world will also go
[1:52:50] away you see you're not going you're not
[1:52:51] going to be confound by the by the laws
[1:52:53] of the Earth by the desires of this
[1:52:55] world you're not going to be confound by
[1:52:57] that because when when when a kid is is
[1:53:00] growing up when they don't know
[1:53:02] something and something is taught onto
[1:53:03] them and after that they finally realize
[1:53:05] it because certain times you can tell a
[1:53:07] kid serveral time they're still not
[1:53:09] going to understand it you see it has to
[1:53:11] be revealed to them because if it's not
[1:53:12] revealed to them they're going to
[1:53:14] continue making the same mistake you see
[1:53:16] and when when it's revealed to them
[1:53:17] that's when they're going to start
[1:53:19] getting away from those things that are
[1:53:20] bad that are harming them
[1:53:23] the same thing here with a Believer when
[1:53:24] you receive the revelation of God when
[1:53:27] you receive the revelation of who you
[1:53:29] are it will make you live right act
[1:53:31] right speak right and be right you see
[1:53:34] it will make you not desire the things
[1:53:35] of the world anymore and it will just
[1:53:37] make you move
[1:53:38] forward am
[1:53:41] am I'll read a closing scripture if the
[1:53:44] musician could come
[1:53:46] up a closing verse um quote in 1961
[1:53:51] December 31st at the evening brother
[1:53:53] brandham says and if God be with us then
[1:53:56] where is all the Miracles brother Bram
[1:53:59] says Jonah in the belly of the well
[1:54:02] acted first upon the word of God he
[1:54:05] knowed he was gone as far as physical
[1:54:09] his hand was bound his feet was
[1:54:12] bound this preacher to the Gentiles was
[1:54:15] thrown out of the ship into the Well's
[1:54:18] belly and down to the bottom of the sea
[1:54:21] now what a condition he is in but first
[1:54:24] he turned himself over in the bottom of
[1:54:27] the well seaweed was wrapped around his
[1:54:30] neck where the well had been eating
[1:54:34] these these weed and things to put
[1:54:36] vitamin in his body his vitamin pills
[1:54:39] and then he got a preacher in there but
[1:54:43] but this preacher came to himself you
[1:54:45] see Jonah had came to himself oh brother
[1:54:49] preacher come to yourself tonight get
[1:54:51] away from them them old Creeds and
[1:54:54] things and come back to a living God to
[1:54:58] a Living Word he came to himself he
[1:55:00] rolled over he Can't Hide You Can't Hide
[1:55:04] a saint from his prayer you turned over
[1:55:07] and he looked everywhere was Well's
[1:55:10] belly all around him east north west and
[1:55:13] south and he realized that he was in the
[1:55:16] Well's belly and down in the bottom of
[1:55:18] the sea the and the storm on the sea all
[1:55:21] hopes were gone all hopes was gone when
[1:55:23] he was in the ship and now he was in the
[1:55:26] Well's B belly farther farther away from
[1:55:29] Hope than ever and when only he
[1:55:33] could when only he could see the belly
[1:55:37] of the well he said there are lying
[1:55:40] vanities I won't believe them anymore
[1:55:43] but I'll look towards your Holy Temple
[1:55:47] Lord the Holy Temple wasn't looking down
[1:55:51] he said it's up there so I'm looking
[1:55:54] towards it so tonight I just telling
[1:55:57] youall to believe and receive the
[1:55:59] Revelation by the spirit and telling you
[1:56:01] the importance of a revelation to their
[1:56:03] Revelation by the spirit to a Believer
[1:56:05] is because once you receive it it will
[1:56:07] change your whole entire way of viewing
[1:56:09] reality even when you're listening to
[1:56:12] songs and music that's why earlier I
[1:56:13] started by saying that in this age if
[1:56:16] David if you were to take David from his
[1:56:18] time when he was dancing with all his
[1:56:21] might and bring him to our time and
[1:56:23] after you say let's have a dance
[1:56:24] competition our age people from this
[1:56:26] time real true message believer should
[1:56:29] be able to dance harder than David
[1:56:31] because we have a higher Revelation that
[1:56:33] he did he had a closed book but we have
[1:56:35] an open book we have an open Revelation
[1:56:38] you see that God himself came down and
[1:56:40] he revealed himself and he even
[1:56:42] Vindicated that he revealed himself and
[1:56:44] gave it to us and if you yourself has
[1:56:47] received the Revelation that mean the
[1:56:49] Greater Works that God spoke of you will
[1:56:51] do and you will realize that that God in
[1:56:54] you because God had called us a peculiar
[1:56:57] people A peculiar treasure and he had
[1:56:59] placed the treasure in us and if that
[1:57:02] the revelation of what that treasure is
[1:57:04] and of who you are is it will even bring
[1:57:07] you to the translation of your own body
[1:57:09] because you're not going to have the
[1:57:10] translation of the body without first
[1:57:12] having the Revelation by the spirit you
[1:57:15] see the world is just waiting for the
[1:57:17] manifestation of of the sons of God you
[1:57:20] see the world is waiting for that
[1:57:21] manifestation
[1:57:22] animals are groaning for that for the
[1:57:24] manifestation of the sons of God but the
[1:57:26] reason why it's not happening right now
[1:57:28] is because the sons of God are too busy
[1:57:30] sleeping they're too busy in Amnesia
[1:57:32] they need to be revealed they need to be
[1:57:34] they need to receive a revelation to
[1:57:36] wake them up and once they receive that
[1:57:38] Revelation and what they're awake that
[1:57:40] will cause that will trigger their
[1:57:42] Rapture and that will bring God down and
[1:57:44] the Rapture will happen and and the
[1:57:45] Earth wouldn't be gring
[1:57:49] anymore amen amen
[1:57:52] if we can bow our head Close Our
[1:57:56] Eyes Lord heavenly father I come to you
[1:57:59] this evening to thank you Lord Jesus
[1:58:00] Christ for everything that you've done
[1:58:02] Lord heavenly father to thank you for
[1:58:03] the word that you had brought forth Lord
[1:58:05] heavenly father I pray Lord heavenly
[1:58:07] father that you may come down and reveal
[1:58:09] more unto your people later on as they
[1:58:11] review it Lord Heavenly Father may you
[1:58:13] reveal the importance of the Revelation
[1:58:16] even greater to them and don't just stop
[1:58:18] and revealing their partners of
[1:58:19] Revelation to them but reveal revelation
[1:58:22] ations and Revelations more Revelations
[1:58:24] onto them Lord heavenly father so they
[1:58:25] can know what they're capable of may you
[1:58:28] give them a revelation of each and every
[1:58:31] Department of each power that you have
[1:58:33] placed in them Lord heavenly father
[1:58:35] because if they were just to receive
[1:58:36] that Revelation they would speak Lord
[1:58:37] heavenly father just like you did with
[1:58:39] your Prophet Lord Lord God you came down
[1:58:41] and you told him to speak to this srel
[1:58:43] he was looking around asking and after
[1:58:45] you told him you told him weren't you g
[1:58:47] weren't you seeking for a game and after
[1:58:49] that he started repenting and after you
[1:58:51] said just speak when he spoke it
[1:58:54] creation came squirrel came Lord
[1:58:55] Heavenly Father only if you can give us
[1:58:57] the Revelation and may you speak to us
[1:58:59] and reveal yourself onto US Lord God and
[1:59:01] so that way we may speak that way we may
[1:59:03] walk right talk right and just hold your
[1:59:05] word because if we were to receive your
[1:59:08] Revelation tonight Lord God we wouldn't
[1:59:10] be able to struggle we wouldn't be
[1:59:12] thinking of anything else but you Lord
[1:59:15] God and we'll just be walking in your
[1:59:17] footstep we'll just be walking and
[1:59:19] following you Lord God and we'll just do
[1:59:21] the greater works that you told us to do
[1:59:23] so I pray Lord God give us the
[1:59:25] revelation of yourself give us the
[1:59:27] revelation of who you are and continue
[1:59:29] to reveal yourself unto us and continue
[1:59:31] to help us Lord Jesus Christ to reveal
[1:59:34] Lord Jesus Christ what a true Christian
[1:59:36] is and what a true Christian is supposed
[1:59:38] to do because a true Christian is
[1:59:39] someone that stays with the word and
[1:59:41] doesn't deviate away from the word and
[1:59:43] if you stay with the word Lord God if we
