[41:15] the Lord because I don't want you to say
[41:16] brother Stephen say I want you to say
[41:19] the Lord have said amen
[41:21] brother Robert ask me a question and it
[41:24] was quite interesting I didn't want to
[41:26] put my my hand on there because I know
[41:30] if I put my hand on there I'm gonna get
[41:31] lost
[41:32] but eventually I put my hand on it so
[41:37] and I realized that he was not brother
[41:38] Robert he was the Holy Spirit
[41:41] open Matthew chapter 5 verse 3.
[41:48] when you get quiet
[41:51] it's not good
[41:54] it makes the devil nervous
[41:57] not me
[42:00] my brother you there on time you got
[42:02] your microphone
[42:03] okay
[42:07] When you pray at home before service you
[42:09] pray like me because we're preaching
[42:11] together
[42:13] if not you're gonna get some fight
[42:17] because I get fight
[42:19] so whoever brother Angelo whoever maybe
[42:22] one day Brother David whoever will be
[42:24] preaching with me make sure your prayer
[42:27] over David is looking left and back
[42:29] maybe brother Isaac whoever is here the
[42:33] patriarch
[42:36] he's checking his hand like oh my God
[42:39] foreign
[42:42] let's go to Matthew chapter 5 verse 3.
[42:46] yeah is that what you asked me brother
[42:48] Robert
[42:50] Matthew 5 verse 3 yeah that was
[42:53] yesterday I tried to run away from it
[42:56] but it seems like it's something we need
[42:59] to deal with it
[43:00] amen
[43:03] amen
[43:05] you understand Prosperity now right
[43:09] right
[43:11] if you don't I will push it back again
[43:17] uh
[43:19] uh everybody there
[43:21] let's read my friend
[43:23] blessed are the poor in water spirit for
[43:28] theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[43:31] what does he mean
[43:36] the Bible say blessed are you when you
[43:39] are poor in spirit
[43:40] so you must be poor in spirit
[43:45] do you see the way we interpret the
[43:46] scripture
[43:52] the Bible say blessed are those that are
[43:55] how who are in what Spirit ah so we must
[43:59] have a poverty mind
[44:01] sir
[44:02] no sir
[44:04] do you see how we interpret the
[44:06] scripture
[44:10] what does it mean poor in spirit
[44:15] because I'm saying the majority of
[44:17] Christians are poor
[44:20] I have the code
[44:22] brother Branham say God's children also
[44:25] are rich
[44:27] let's take both of them
[44:31] but the Bible say blessed are those that
[44:34] are poor in the spirit
[44:37] so you must be poor
[44:39] and then we get more anointing
[44:47] don't get quiet
[44:49] I didn't read my word Matthew 5 verse 3
[44:52] the Bible say blessed are the poor in
[44:57] spirit
[44:59] for theirs is the kingdom of water
[45:01] heaven
[45:04] the Bible didn't say blessed are the
[45:07] poor in money no sir
[45:15] did the bible say that
[45:18] we the one that put that
[45:20] when we say blessed are the poor in
[45:22] spirit we put poor and money
[45:30] the Bible say blessed are the poor
[45:37] naughty money
[45:42] I put it on the board you have it on
[45:45] your lap not in money that's us who
[45:48] interpret that the Bible is very
[45:50] specific
[45:51] poor in spirit
[45:56] so in the spirit you must be poor what
[45:59] does it mean
[46:05] poor in spirit
[46:08] amen
[46:10] we know that man has three parts
[46:15] everybody okay
[46:18] we have the body
[46:21] we have the soul and we have water
[46:24] spirit and God say I want you to be poor
[46:27] in spirit
[46:33] everybody okay everybody okay in other
[46:36] words
[46:37] we know that the spirit direct the brain
[46:44] can you say Amen
[46:47] say just a man
[46:49] if you say Amen you will understand it
[46:54] hi everybody okay and we know that the
[46:57] soul is in the heart
[47:00] everybody okay amen and the Bible said
[47:02] blessed are those that are poor away in
[47:05] spirit
[47:07] [Applause]
[47:09] everybody good
[47:11] why because the way God created man Man
[47:16] was created to be dependent
[47:21] Man was created to depend on someone
[47:28] amen
[47:31] even though Adam was the God of this
[47:34] Earth he had to stay in connection
[47:37] that's right
[47:39] when Adam cut his connection everything
[47:42] fell
[47:44] because man must be in depth not
[47:47] independent but dependent
[47:52] yes sir
[47:54] if I don't get to what I want to preach
[47:56] that's fine because some of you take a
[47:59] long time to crank
[48:02] everybody okay yeah I have to push push
[48:05] push push that's why you need to pray
[48:06] yourself at home so when I'm here we are
[48:09] moving correctly because you're dragging
[48:12] me back everybody okay Jeremiah 10 verse
[48:16] 23 oh Lord I know that the way of a man
[48:20] is not in water himself it is not in men
[48:24] that walketh to do water direct his
[48:27] steps you have to be dependent that's
[48:29] right
[48:33] no matter how smart you are you need to
[48:37] be dependent that's right
[48:38] [Applause]
[48:42] the Bible say in Proverbs 21 verse 2
[48:45] every way of a man is how right in which
[48:49] I his own eyes that's why you need to be
[48:52] poor in the spirit
[48:55] Hallelujah
[48:57] everybody okay a poor in spirit is
[49:01] somebody who is depressed or he's
[49:05] lacking something
[49:07] in the spirit
[49:09] in other words it's somebody who
[49:11] recognize
[49:13] how much is unable
[49:17] on himself amen
[49:21] it's
[49:23] is it complicated no sir it's somebody
[49:26] who understands that spiritually
[49:29] speaking if he doesn't get help he's
[49:32] gonna be in trouble that's right
[49:35] it's a man that is humble in his own
[49:38] eyes
[49:40] it is a man that has a humble opinion
[49:44] about himself amen it is a man that
[49:48] reckon us his poverty in his ability
[49:54] oh man
[49:57] it doesn't mean poor in money
[50:02] I know I'm shaking message Believers I
[50:05] know how you believe
[50:07] but since I'm independent
[50:10] according to the church I depend on the
[50:13] big boss but I don't have a bishop the
[50:16] only Bishop is the Lord Jesus Christ
[50:18] amen so I don't have to preach something
[50:20] to please a preacher no sir okay brother

[59:03] each kind whose seed is in itself upon
[59:08] the Earth and he was so you might be
[59:11] seated
[59:13] glory to God so God
[59:17] before he created the trees
[59:20] all the fruit trees
[59:23] God spoke to the Earth
[59:27] amen
[59:28] because those things were in the Earth
[59:33] and God spoke to the Earth and say you
[59:35] Earth

[59:39] and they came out of the Earth
[59:41] in other words the fruit trees and

[1:00:13] so I can't fly with this
[1:00:15] especially when you take a long time to
[1:00:17] say Amen
[1:00:20] then I have to wait until you say Amen
[1:00:25] we need a battery bar together verse 20
[1:00:28] and God said let the waters
[1:00:31] bring forth abundantly the moving
[1:00:35] creature that his life
[1:00:37] and found that may fly above the Earth
[1:00:40] in the open firmament of water heaven
[1:00:44] I have another scripture that the fly
[1:00:47] the bird and everything came from the
[1:00:49] Dust
[1:00:50] but the dust that was in the water

[1:01:31] Earth
[1:01:32] so the tree came from the Earth
[1:01:35] right the animal came from the Earth
[1:01:38] the bird the fish is everything came out
[1:01:42] of something
[1:01:43] now verse 26. thank you my brother
[1:01:47] and God say let us make how man
[1:01:52] in our own image and our own likeness
[1:01:56] which material did God spoke to
[1:02:00] him
[1:02:04] to create the trees God spoke to the
[1:02:07] Earth
[1:02:08] to create the the fishes God went and
[1:02:12] spoke to the water to create the Beast
[1:02:15] of the field God went and spoke to the
[1:02:17] Earth but when he was time to create man
[1:02:27] God begin to talk to himself
[1:02:32] in other words the material that
[1:02:34] produced man amen
[1:02:37] oh
[1:02:39] man
[1:02:41] I'm not talking about this no sir I'm
[1:02:44] talking about
[1:02:46] but you know you know my language right
[1:02:47] not this bad
[1:02:49] you know my language right now
[1:02:51] to produce man God went to himself
[1:02:57] to find a material in him
[1:03:00] [Applause]
[1:03:08] the real you never came from the Earth
[1:03:12] [Applause]
[1:03:14] the one that we bury in the cemetery
[1:03:17] never came from that that's not you
[1:03:21] that's a vehicle
[1:03:23] say closing but the real youth you came
[1:03:27] from a deity material amen
[1:03:35] that's why Jesus say I come from and I'm
[1:03:39] going backwards
[1:03:41] [Applause]
[1:03:44] [Music]
[1:03:44] [Applause]
[1:03:46] everybody okay everybody okay and this
[1:03:49] species let me ask you a question
[1:03:51] there's an elephant look like God
[1:03:54] does a tree look like God
[1:03:56] does a fish look like God but man when
[1:04:01] they pull him not only is he having the
[1:04:04] same material like God but he must look
[1:04:07] like God
[1:04:09] not only the image even the likeness
[1:04:14] [Applause]
[1:04:20] everybody okay verse 26 let us make man
[1:04:25] in our image after our likeness and let
[1:04:30] them
[1:04:34] Dominion so the man that have dominion
[1:04:38] is not this one
[1:04:40] [Music]
[1:04:42] am I reading a different Bible
[1:04:47] everybody okay dominion over the water
[1:04:50] the fish of the sea over the water the
[1:04:54] and offer the water the Carol of the
[1:04:57] water all the Earth and offer every
[1:05:00] creeping things that creepeth upon water
[1:05:02] the Earth so whatever was created before
[1:05:04] man is on the man
[1:05:08] follow me
[1:05:10] [Music]
[1:05:13] so God created man in his own image
[1:05:18] in the image of who God
[1:05:21] I am not in the image of Satan no sir
[1:05:27] when God was created me he put himself
[1:05:30] and he began to look at himself and say
[1:05:38] yes
[1:05:40] sir yeah
[1:05:42] yes sir
[1:05:45] in the image of God created him how male
[1:05:50] and female created he watered them and
[1:05:53] God blessed them
[1:06:00] [Applause]
[1:06:03] the blessing of the Lord does what
[1:06:09] are you afraid
[1:06:12] are you afraid your pastor is not afraid
[1:06:16] so you must be like me
[1:06:18] follow me as I follow right
[1:06:22] everybody okay God bless them amen God
[1:06:27] didn't bless this one
[1:06:29] [Music]
[1:06:33] everybody okay everybody okay amen God
[1:06:37] bless them and say to them
[1:06:42] be water fruitful
[1:06:47] God didn't say you shall be fruitful no
[1:06:51] sir
[1:06:53] when God was blessing them he was in the
[1:06:57] present tense
[1:06:59] so once God said be fruitful other
[1:07:03] medically man is already fruitful
[1:07:05] [Applause]
[1:07:07] instantaneously
[1:07:11] be fruitful now
[1:07:15] but if you notice man didn't have the
[1:07:17] body
[1:07:19] [Applause]
[1:07:22] he didn't have the guardians but he was
[1:07:25] already fruitful in the spirit
[1:07:27] I am here
[1:07:30] so your ability to multiply doesn't
[1:07:34] depend on this
[1:07:35] [Applause]
[1:07:38] it depends on who is inside
[1:07:41] that's the man I'm trying to free amen
[1:07:45] [Applause]
[1:07:51] okay no problem be fruitful and water
[1:07:55] multiply and do what replenish the Earth
[1:07:58] and do water subdue it and have water
[1:08:01] Dominion how is the spirit man going to
[1:08:03] do this
[1:08:08] he doesn't have a body but without a
[1:08:11] body he can multiply he can replenish
[1:08:14] the Earth
[1:08:15] how is he going to do that
[1:08:18] thank you Jesus offer the file of the
[1:08:21] offer the fish of the sea over the fall
[1:08:24] of the year and over every living thing
[1:08:26] that moveth upon the Water the Earth
[1:08:28] verse 29 glory to God
[1:08:31] and God say behold I have given you
[1:08:35] every herb
[1:08:37] bearing seed
[1:08:39] which is upon the face of the Earth
[1:08:42] and every tree

[1:11:11] [Applause]
[1:11:15] are you up to date with the sermon
[1:11:18] if a man is looking for a fruit in a
[1:11:21] tree he is in the perfect will of God
[1:11:24] Amen
[1:11:29] let's go to mark 11.
[1:11:31] [Music]
[1:11:39] advise you many times when you listen to
[1:11:42] the sermon throughout the week go ahead
[1:11:43] and review it
[1:11:48] especially if you battle demon of
[1:11:51] sleeping
[1:11:57] amen
[1:11:58] amen
[1:12:00] Mark 11 verse 12. if you dare you can
[1:12:03] say Amen
[1:12:04] on the moral
[1:12:07] when the when they will come from
[1:12:11] Bethany brother clock
[1:12:15] I have the quote
[1:12:18] he was hungry
[1:12:21] remember the man that was in Genesis as
[1:12:25] a name
[1:12:27] him and his wife both of them have one
[1:12:30] name
[1:12:32] and they call him Adam
[1:12:36] and the Bible called Jesus the last Adam
[1:12:43] so Jesus going around he was hungry
[1:12:50] he didn't go to the restaurant
[1:12:53] look where he's going
[1:12:57] so when a man is looking for a fruit
[1:13:02] on a tree he is in the perfect will of
[1:13:05] God
[1:13:06] [Music]
[1:13:08] he is in the original will of God
[1:13:13] everybody okay
[1:13:14] he will help you in the future
[1:13:17] about the spoken word
[1:13:19] everybody okay
[1:13:20] and seeing a fig tree a pharaoh
[1:13:24] having leaves he came is happily I can't
[1:13:29] cross the description my friend he might
[1:13:31] find anything there on and when he came
[1:13:34] to it he found nothing by leaves for the
[1:13:39] time of fig was not yet
[1:13:42] so Jesus was looking for fruit
[1:13:45] according to the word of God he was
[1:13:47] perfectly back in Genesis
[1:13:51] amen
[1:13:55] this was not the Time of the Season
[1:13:58] right
[1:14:00] right do you think Jesus didn't know
[1:14:02] [Applause]
[1:14:04] Jesus was he was God
[1:14:08] do you think Jesus didn't know so how
[1:14:10] was Jesus looking for fruit in a place
[1:14:14] that fruit are not supposed to be there
[1:14:21] so where was Jesus
[1:14:24] where was his mind
[1:14:27] because in the Book of Revelation
[1:14:30] there is a tree of life
[1:14:32] he bring fruit every month
[1:14:38] you know that scripture right do you
[1:14:41] know that scripture the the tree of life
[1:14:43] doesn't have season
[1:14:45] every month it's bringing food
[1:14:49] so you can go in January you get fruit
[1:14:51] on February you go fruit but Jesus went
[1:14:53] and it was not the season that's
[1:14:56] right so where is the mind of Jesus
[1:15:00] everybody okay
[1:15:02] and Jesus answered and said to it no man
[1:15:06] eat fruit of you Hereafter forever and
[1:15:09] he disappointed water heard it
[1:15:11] why do you curse a tree
[1:15:15] that is not in the season
[1:15:20] and him being in the perfect will of God
[1:15:22] looking for fruit
[1:15:26] but the tree doesn't give him what he
[1:15:28] wants
[1:15:29] so Jesus activates something
[1:15:37] job 2 verse 19.
[1:15:40] and when the evening was come he went
[1:15:42] out of the city and in the morning
[1:15:45] brother Branham say around 11 o'clock I
[1:15:48] have a quote from 8 and 11.
[1:15:51] okay everybody okay
[1:15:53] as they pass by they saw the Fig Tree
[1:15:57] Jada from the root where life was hidden
[1:16:00] and Peter called to remember and say to
[1:16:03] him Master behold the Fig Tree which you
[1:16:06] curse is within the way and Jesus
[1:16:09] answering said to them have what faith
[1:16:12] in God for verily I say unto you that
[1:16:16] whatsoever you whatsoever shall say
[1:16:19] whosoever thank you shall say to this
[1:16:22] mountain
[1:16:24] so Jesus is bringing them to a different
[1:16:27] Realm
[1:16:32] of speaking things
[1:16:35] [Music]
[1:16:37] amen say to this mountain be the room be
[1:16:41] you remove and be cast into the sea and
[1:16:44] shall not doubt in his heart
[1:16:47] but shall believe that those things
[1:16:49] which he say shall come to pass so the
[1:16:53] mouth and the Heart must be in harmony
[1:16:57] I won't get to that today but I will
[1:16:59] show you how it works everybody okay
[1:17:01] whatever you say in your mouth and your
[1:17:03] heart must be in harmony
[1:17:05] if one is saying something else and the
[1:17:07] other one something else it won't happen
[1:17:10] we okay
[1:17:11] shall come to pass he shall have
[1:17:13] whatsoever he says
[1:17:16] therefore I say to you
[1:17:18] whatsoever think you desire when you
[1:17:21] want to pray
[1:17:26] the first time Jesus didn't say prayer
[1:17:31] he says speaking
[1:17:33] and it happened the second time he
[1:17:36] included prayer
[1:17:38] so the third book got two ways
[1:17:44] he can work with our prayer
[1:17:46] [Music]
[1:17:49] did you see Joshua standing and praying
[1:17:52] to talk to the son
[1:17:54] so who told him to talk to the son
[1:17:57] and the son of babe
[1:18:00] did you see him saying guys keep
[1:18:02] fighting the enemy let me kneel down a
[1:18:04] little bit here and search for the Lord
[1:18:09] no problem therefore I say to you what
[1:18:13] things so ever
[1:18:15] desire when you
[1:18:16] believe that you received them and you
[1:18:20] shall have them so he works with our
[1:18:23] prayer and he works also with prayer
[1:18:27] because in the tenth Vision the top
[1:18:30] brother Branham enter into the secret
[1:18:32] chamber
[1:18:33] your father who sees you in prayer
[1:18:35] brother Branham said that was the third
[1:18:37] book
[1:18:37] are we okay
[1:18:39] let's go to Hebrew then we pray
[1:18:44] so we move from Genesis all the way to
[1:18:47] the second hand I'm looking for fruit
[1:18:50] and he didn't find fruit his book
[1:18:53] and when they say look at what is
[1:18:55] happening he say all that Hadith is
[1:18:57] based onto one thing
[1:18:58] faith
[1:19:01] amen
[1:19:03] let's go now Faith in prayer faith in a
[1:19:06] spoken word uh Hebrew chapter 11 verse
[1:19:09] 1. if you dare you can say Amen
[1:19:11] now Faith you understand this now is the
[1:19:15] substance of things hopeful now you know
[1:19:17] the difference
[1:19:19] we went through this the evidence of
[1:19:21] things not see you understand this
[1:19:24] everybody okay
[1:19:25] for buy it by faith
[1:19:29] the Elder obtained a good report
[1:19:32] through faith
[1:19:34] we understand that the world so Faith
[1:19:38] bring understanding
[1:19:40] or revelation
[1:19:43] this is not intellectual
[1:19:46] everybody okay that the world were
[1:19:49] framed by the word of God so that things
[1:19:51] which are seen were not made of things
[1:19:54] which do what appear let me hold on to
[1:19:57] that job to verse uh five
[1:20:01] by faith Enoch was translated that he
[1:20:06] should not see death
[1:20:08] and was not found because God has
[1:20:11] translated him
[1:20:14] watch this for before his translation
[1:20:18] in other words before God come and pick
[1:20:21] him up
[1:20:23] before his translation
[1:20:25] he has this testimony
[1:20:28] what is the testimony that he please
[1:20:31] look God what does pleasing God means
[1:20:34] verse six
[1:20:36] amen but without water faith it is how
[1:20:40] impossible to please who him so before
[1:20:43] Enoch who be taken up to the rapture
[1:20:47] he must have a faith
[1:20:54] that faith that please God in other
[1:20:58] words before the rapture
[1:21:00] about come on now everybody okay the
[1:21:04] brand must be in a state of a faith
[1:21:11] Jesus even said when the son of man
[1:21:13] shall come shall he fan Faith so you
[1:21:17] cannot God you will never go to the
[1:21:19] Rapture if you don't have faith
[1:21:24] you must be at a certain level
[1:21:27] to be picking up
[1:21:29] [Applause]
[1:21:32] God will not take you if you zero
[1:21:36] you must be already living in faith
[1:21:40] [Applause]
[1:21:42] for God to translate you
[1:21:49] everybody good
[1:21:51] everybody good listen to this
[1:21:54] before we pray
[1:21:56] the Bible says this we read it last week
[1:21:59] he said let the word of water my mouth
[1:22:02] and the meditation of what my heart be
[1:22:05] what acceptable in that water thy side
[1:22:08] acceptable means pleasing
[1:22:11] [Applause]
[1:22:13] yes sir but without faith it's
[1:22:16] impossible to do whatever please God so
[1:22:18] the word of your mouth must be the word
[1:22:21] of sex
[1:22:22] [Applause]
[1:22:24] everybody okay
[1:22:27] everybody okay
[1:22:30] David say the word of my mouth what come
[1:22:34] out of my mouth and what is coming from
[1:22:36] the heart amen both of these must be
[1:22:40] acceptable
[1:22:42] in either way they must be pleasing
[1:22:45] and to please God you must have water
[1:22:48] hey so the word that come out of your
[1:22:51] mouth must not be dry word
[1:22:55] that's why what you spoke to happen
[1:23:00] everybody okay you must speak with
[1:23:03] Resurrection
[1:23:06] so whatever you speak and whatever you
[1:23:09] meditate in your heart when we begin to
[1:23:13] bring Faith it is already pleasing to
[1:23:15] the Lord
[1:23:16] [Applause]
[1:23:19] everybody okay I will go slowly until
[1:23:22] even a baby in this church understand
[1:23:24] what I'm saying
[1:23:26] thank you
[1:23:27] Romans 10 verse 8 the Bible say the word
[1:23:30] is where each way even in thy mouth oh
[1:23:34] where in thy heart the word of water
[1:23:38] not just the word a word of faith it is
[1:23:42] a revealed world
[1:23:44] word
[1:23:47] [Music]
[1:23:49] don't worry my friend which we preach
[1:23:51] that if that shall confess with the
[1:23:54] mouth the Lord who Jesus and Shall
[1:23:56] Believe In The Water all right that God
[1:23:59] has raised him from the water and that
[1:24:01] shall be water so what comes in the
[1:24:04] mouth and the heart if they correct the
[1:24:06] result will happen
[1:24:11] as a team this is where we're heading
[1:24:15] John say
[1:24:16] for whatsoever is born of God
[1:24:20] how are you born of God Peter said being
[1:24:24] born again not by corruptible sin but by
[1:24:28] water Incorruptible by the water word of
[1:24:31] God which the water level and water or
[1:24:34] body the word of God which liveth is not
[1:24:38] the Bible
[1:24:41] the Bible is the letter
[1:24:44] they let they kill us
[1:24:46] but the one that by death and lives is a
[1:24:50] Living Word he described the logos
[1:24:55] You Are Born Again by the pillar of Fire
[1:25:00] [Music]
[1:25:00] [Applause]
[1:25:05] because it's incorruptible
[1:25:08] corruptable is our mother and our father
[1:25:12] but the word of God when we are born
[1:25:14] again we are born again from our
[1:25:16] spiritual father
[1:25:19] anything corruptable
[1:25:22] end up and John say who surveys born of
[1:25:27] God not of men of a chemist water the
[1:25:30] world so whatever is in the world if you
[1:25:34] are born again you can overcome it
[1:25:39] because in Genesis everything was under
[1:25:42] men
[1:25:43] [Applause]
[1:25:45] the three and the men The Lion and the
[1:25:49] man the elephant
[1:25:51] deficiency because God said dominate
[1:25:55] everything some do everything
[1:25:58] put it under control
[1:26:02] and who did that a Son of God because
[1:26:05] the Bible said Adam was a Son of God and
[1:26:08] if you are born of God
[1:26:12] because Adam was not only male
[1:26:15] he was man and water female so a Son of
[1:26:19] God here is also a woman and a man
[1:26:22] [Applause]
[1:26:29] is it a problem the Bible said God
[1:26:33] called them Adam
[1:26:34] [Applause]
[1:26:37] Adam was a name for the woman and the
[1:26:40] man
[1:26:40] [Applause]
[1:26:45] created man
[1:26:47] but he said the man there was a woman
[1:26:50] whoever is born of God may be a man or a
[1:26:54] woman
[1:26:57] but if you are born of God you overcome
[1:27:00] the world
[1:27:02] everybody they didn't say you overcome
[1:27:05] the tree of the world
[1:27:07] they didn't say you overcome the the uh
[1:27:11] water the animal of the world God put a
[1:27:15] package
[1:27:17] you overcome the world in other words
[1:27:20] the world
[1:27:22] and what is in the world
[1:27:24] and what is it under the world
[1:27:26] everything that is connected to the
[1:27:29] world I can overcome it
[1:27:36] so how do I overcome those things
[1:27:39] what do I use to overcome
[1:27:42] if I cannot if I need now I understand
[1:27:46] my position
[1:27:47] that who I am I cannot overcome the
[1:27:49] world
[1:27:51] if I touch this is this part of the
[1:27:53] world I can overcome it
[1:27:57] by my birth I can overcome it
[1:28:00] but how do I overcome it
[1:28:03] can I continue yes yes the Bible say
[1:28:06] whosoever is born of God or if they
[1:28:09] cometh water the world and this is the
[1:28:11] water victory that overcometh the water
[1:28:14] the world even our water faith
[1:28:20] so if there is a territory
[1:28:23] in this world that I have not overcome
[1:28:27] yet
[1:28:28] if I take Faith and I push it over there
[1:28:32] I will love it coming
[1:28:37] because the Bible says believe on the
[1:28:40] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:28:42] and you shall be saved you and who your
[1:28:46] house do you know what brother Branham
[1:28:47] say the same fact that you apply to
[1:28:50] yourself
[1:28:52] [Music]
[1:28:55] if you apply it to your children that
[1:28:59] faith will do the same thing
[1:29:01] [Applause]
[1:29:04] Jesus use it on the tree
[1:29:13] whoever is born of God will overcome the
[1:29:17] world how do you overcome the world you
[1:29:20] overcome the word by faith
[1:29:24] so if you use the faith and you put in
[1:29:27] everything that is in the world
[1:29:29] everything in the world must obey you
[1:29:33] that's why Jesus said if you speak to
[1:29:35] their Mountain the mountain is in the
[1:29:37] world
[1:29:42] but sometimes you can even stretch
[1:29:46] because Joshua stretch
[1:29:49] he spoke to the Moon
[1:29:54] Joshua went outside the Earth and spoke
[1:29:57] to the moon and to the Sun and they obey
[1:30:01] him under the Old Testament his
[1:30:04] stretched
[1:30:07] [Applause]
[1:30:08] oh
[1:30:10] [Applause]
[1:30:13] everybody don't care man let's pray
[1:30:16] Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching
[1:30:19] you humbly this morning Father once
[1:30:21] again thanking you for your grace for
[1:30:24] your love and your mercy and for
[1:30:25] everything you have been doing for us
[1:30:27] father we are committing ourselves unto
[1:30:29] the hand may your spirit come and move
[1:30:31] me completely out of the way and may you
[1:30:34] come and teach us and speak to us and
[1:30:37] bless us and fill us and Deliver Us and
[1:30:40] heal us and affect every aspect of our
[1:30:43] life those that are here and those that
[1:30:45] are streaming and will be streaming
[1:30:47] later on in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:30:49] amen
[1:30:52] my subject this morning glory to God
[1:30:56] is the four phases of roof
[1:30:59] faith
[1:31:01] Victory to all
[1:31:06] Faith it's a victory to everything
[1:31:11] if you want to win everything
[1:31:13] use faith
[1:31:15] because Faith overcometh the world
[1:31:18] Faith even stretches
[1:31:23] because the universe belonged to my
[1:31:25] father
[1:31:28] brother Branham say God is the god of
[1:31:31] the universe and man was given the Earth
[1:31:34] but you can stretch it's still your
[1:31:36] father's property you're not trespassing
[1:31:41] even if you spoke to the Galaxy you're
[1:31:44] not trespassing it is your father
[1:31:46] property
[1:31:50] everybody okay
[1:31:52] everybody good everybody good we found
[1:31:56] out that before Enoch was taken out
[1:31:59] Enoch must have a certain condition
[1:32:02] for the Rapture if that condition is not
[1:32:06] met no rapture
[1:32:09] brother Branham say but look friend the
[1:32:13] time is coming
[1:32:14] that when there is rising up a water a
[1:32:17] church if we can have faithful Divine
[1:32:21] Healing
[1:32:22] [Music]
[1:32:23] how are we going to have faith for water
[1:32:25] the Rapture so before we get to
[1:32:28] rapturing Faith Divine Healing must be
[1:32:31] something common
[1:32:38] that's fine
[1:32:40] we got to move our train
[1:32:42] we got together this Earth old and water
[1:32:46] slow Church conditions that we are in
[1:32:49] in message churches
[1:32:51] [Applause]
[1:32:55] do what step out and do what launcher
[1:32:58] cut the water the shoreline and get out
[1:33:01] into somewhere where you lose all your
[1:33:04] senses of water fear and water doubt out
[1:33:07] there where our feets are what possible
[1:33:10] brother just as free as he can be
[1:33:13] [Applause]
[1:33:15] we wish too much
[1:33:19] the time of wishing is over
[1:33:22] I don't need to sit wishing wishing
[1:33:25] wishing wishing wishes doesn't
[1:33:27] accomplish nothing
[1:33:29] it is a time to believe
[1:33:32] [Applause]
[1:33:36] don't worry my friend we'll get there as
[1:33:39] we climbing I truly believe before the
[1:33:43] church can have the Rapture it's got to
[1:33:45] have water rapturing faith we can't even
[1:33:48] have faith for Divine Healing let alone
[1:33:50] water Rapture in faith you see what
[1:33:52] brother bottom is saying
[1:33:54] you got to have a faith that shall
[1:33:57] change and Quicken this body
[1:33:59] and be taken away I believe there is a
[1:34:02] church on its Road tonight
[1:34:05] a power of the Living God that man will
[1:34:09] do water
[1:34:10] [Music]
[1:34:12] speak the word hear and water there and
[1:34:16] he said
[1:34:21] a church is coming out not a
[1:34:24] psychologist
[1:34:25] not some disput on make-believe but a
[1:34:29] real true genuine anointed Holy Ghost
[1:34:33] caller church house amen
[1:34:38] so before we leave
[1:34:40] and go out of this word we must be at a
[1:34:44] certain level
[1:34:46] we cannot be operating under and expect
[1:34:49] the rapture
[1:34:51] because the Rapture is a high faith
[1:34:55] everybody okay everybody good glory be
[1:34:59] to God as we're traveling in the
[1:35:02] Tabernacle we're trying to get roof into
[1:35:04] a different Tabernacle we already

[1:35:36] rapture
[1:35:37] which is the body change
[1:35:40] everybody okay the new birth changed the
[1:35:43] inside
[1:35:45] the Rapture changed the outside
[1:35:48] everybody okay
[1:35:50] but before we are translated we must
[1:35:54] reach a certain state
[1:35:58] amen because this on you put you in
[1:36:01] but this one finishes but before there's
[1:36:05] a in between the starting and the
[1:36:07] finishing there is a journey
[1:36:10] [Music]
[1:36:12] amen and the new birth put you in sad
[1:36:16] crust
[1:36:17] which is their beloved
[1:36:20] that's why John say and now we're
[1:36:22] climbing that beloved I wish that there
[1:36:26] may prosper
[1:36:30] can you say Amen now you should be now
[1:36:32] chewing this building
[1:36:34] amen that you prosper and be in good
[1:36:37] health
[1:36:38] even as the salt water prosperity and we
[1:36:42] understand from last Sunday everything
[1:36:44] must Prosper together Everybody Must Go
[1:36:47] Together
[1:36:49] everybody must leave Egypt nothing stay
[1:36:53] behind not even a hoof
[1:36:55] every aspect of your life must prosper
[1:37:00] as your soul prosper
[1:37:04] some of you love sickness or love
[1:37:08] uh what certain condition I don't know
[1:37:12] but let's deal with this
[1:37:17] listen to this glory to God
[1:37:20] recently a man said to me say brother
[1:37:23] Branham I do not believe in Divine
[1:37:26] Healing
[1:37:30] can you continue brother Benjamin
[1:37:32] I said well it wasn't for you it was for
[1:37:36] believers continue my friend him that
[1:37:39] believeth that's who it's for it wasn't
[1:37:41] for unbelievers in the beginning
[1:37:43] I said so you shall never draw any
[1:37:47] dividend off of it so let's don't worry
[1:37:51] about it
[1:37:53] the man say I believe that sickness is a
[1:37:57] glory to God
[1:37:58] oh
[1:38:01] we usually don't say that in our mouth
[1:38:04] but with our action this is what we say
[1:38:09] [Applause]
[1:38:11] you never said it in your mouth but
[1:38:14] damning to you you already believe it
[1:38:18] that it's normal
[1:38:19] because all my family have blood
[1:38:21] pressure
[1:38:23] [Applause]
[1:38:28] can I continue and brother Branham said
[1:38:32] I said well it is strange you had your
[1:38:35] wife operated on for appendicitis
[1:38:38] you must it must have cut the glory out
[1:38:43] in other words if sickness is for the
[1:38:46] glory of God you should not go to the
[1:38:49] doctor
[1:38:51] because when you go to the doctor you
[1:38:54] are removing the glory of God
[1:38:56] [Applause]
[1:39:06] wants you to be poor right here
[1:39:08] don't go to work
[1:39:10] foreign
[1:39:14] because when you pay bill you are
[1:39:16] removing it
[1:39:18] you need to be behind bills
[1:39:25] can I continue
[1:39:27] can I continue and brother Branham said
[1:39:30] must have cut the glory out so people
[1:39:33] that talk like that there is water
[1:39:36] something wrong God don't get Glory out
[1:39:40] of people being what see

[1:40:27] if you are more blessed when you are
[1:40:30] dead and you can do more for the Lord

[1:41:10] would you rather be in water
[1:41:12] that is water scripture above all things
[1:41:16] that you prosper in water hell the
[1:41:18] rather of the scripture inspired by who
[1:41:21] the Holy Spirit which the scriptures say
[1:41:23] all scripture is given by water
[1:41:25] inspiration so God wants you to prosper
[1:41:28] [Applause]
[1:41:29] and be in good health
[1:41:32] your sickness doesn't glorify God
[1:41:35] [Applause]
[1:41:42] the people see you going to church every
[1:41:44] day and you're the one suffering more
[1:41:45] than them
[1:41:47] is he glorifying God they said she goes
[1:41:51] to church she faster the time she's the
[1:41:53] one to have more problem than us
[1:41:56] [Applause]
[1:41:58] he doesn't glorify God
[1:42:02] it is not the glory of God God wants you
[1:42:06] to be happy
[1:42:07] [Applause]
[1:42:09] yeah amen
[1:42:13] glory to God we have sent you this court
[1:42:17] the scripture the Bible say Delight
[1:42:20] thyself also in the Lord and it shall
[1:42:23] give the water desire if you notice
[1:42:25] desire is not singular
[1:42:33] desire is plural
[1:42:37] we love to put it singularly the desire
[1:42:41] yes of that heart
[1:42:43] so if you want God to give you the
[1:42:46] desire you need to Delight on him first
[1:42:52] everybody okay everybody good so far and
[1:42:56] we found last week that Matthew said but
[1:42:59] seeking water the Water Kingdom of God
[1:43:02] and his righteousness and all these
[1:43:04] things shall be how added unto you what
[1:43:06] is the kingdom of God
[1:43:10] we always say what in the message we are
[1:43:14] big in terms that we don't even
[1:43:16] understand
[1:43:18] please seek ye first the kingdom of God
[1:43:21] somebody say okay let's go to church or
[1:43:22] let's do this what is the kingdom of God
[1:43:26] what does he mean
[1:43:28] the kingdom of God is what
[1:43:32] William Marion Branham hallelujah what
[1:43:35] is the kingdom of God brother Branham
[1:43:37] say God in the future home already took
[1:43:41] up his abode
[1:43:43] how potentially because the New
[1:43:46] Jerusalem have not come down yet
[1:43:50] so potentially God is on Earth
[1:43:53] normally God should come when the New
[1:43:55] Jerusalem come down he's preaching the
[1:43:57] future home and God get in the city and
[1:44:00] go live in his City but potentially God
[1:44:03] is already on Earth
[1:44:05] where is he
[1:44:07] brother Branham say the kingdom of God
[1:44:10] is in the earth now why in the hearts of
[1:44:14] his Saints
[1:44:15] [Applause]
[1:44:18] are we okay it is his attribute
[1:44:23] that he begin in the beginning now his
[1:44:27] attribute is what redeemed what what is
[1:44:30] he wedding to redeem the water the Earth
[1:44:32] to set his attribute on there to fulfill
[1:44:34] exactly the predestinated water so when
[1:44:38] the Holy Spirit come in your life he
[1:44:41] brings God inside of you
[1:44:43] [Applause]
[1:44:47] let's go my friend
[1:44:50] kingdom is not of this Earth
[1:44:53] God's kingdom is in our hearts it is a
[1:44:57] water spiritual Kingdom that we are born
[1:45:00] into it
[1:45:03] Jesus said the kingdom of God comes but
[1:45:07] not with value without Valance and the
[1:45:09] kingdom of God is how within you the
[1:45:12] whiter the Holy Spirit which is water
[1:45:14] God's kingdom moving in the water man
[1:45:17] and governing and controlling him that
[1:45:20] is the water the Kingdom so seek ye
[1:45:23] first the kingdom of God means the Holy
[1:45:27] Ghost
[1:45:28] when I get the Holy Ghost then
[1:45:31] everything will be water added unto me
[1:45:34] [Applause]
[1:45:41] everybody okay
[1:45:43] everybody okay once you get the Holy
[1:45:46] Ghost you need to go back to God you say
[1:45:49] the first step is already checked now
[1:45:51] I'm ready for the next step
[1:45:54] because the new birth put you in the
[1:45:56] start mode
[1:46:01] everybody good
[1:46:03] everybody good
[1:46:05] listen to what brother Branham say a
[1:46:07] glory to God he said but the kingdom of
[1:46:10] God is established where in the heart
[1:46:13] and the water soul of a man by water a
[1:46:16] revelation
[1:46:17] a revelation of Jesus Christ that's why
[1:46:21] brother Branham said the new birth is a
[1:46:24] revelation
[1:46:26] of Jesus Christ personally to you
[1:46:29] he said Upon This Rock
[1:46:32] I shall build my church
[1:46:34] and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[1:46:36] water against upon this water Revelation
[1:46:39] and to have a revelation you become a
[1:46:42] water believer and whatever believing
[1:46:44] this son shall follow them the water
[1:46:46] believe so first the kingdom must be
[1:46:50] establishing you
[1:46:53] amen when the kingdom is in you then
[1:46:58] everything else will be water that's why
[1:47:01] Jesus said if my word abide in you damn
[1:47:06] I
[1:47:09] you don't ask if he does anybody in you
[1:47:13] open John 15.
[1:47:22] I'm giving you the scripture so I can
[1:47:25] lock those devil out
[1:47:29] when they begin to talk to you a
[1:47:31] scripture pop-up a scripture pop-up if
[1:47:33] you dare you can say Amen
[1:47:35] John 15 verse 7 if you dare you can say
[1:47:38] Amen
[1:47:40] you there
[1:47:42] if you abide in me
[1:47:44] and my words the water abide in you and
[1:47:47] brother Branham say him and his word are
[1:47:49] one
[1:47:50] brother Brahman said you cannot have one
[1:47:52] without the other
[1:47:53] so if him abiding in you and his word
[1:47:57] him and his word are one it is the
[1:48:00] revealed word
[1:48:02] it is God the word that liveth and abide
[1:48:06] there forever
[1:48:08] it is a word that does have a beginning
[1:48:10] that's a heaven and it's a badder
[1:48:13] forever
[1:48:14] in the beginning was the word Christos
[1:48:17] Christ the logos if the word abide in
[1:48:21] you me in you the word in you amen so
[1:48:24] number one the word and he must be in
[1:48:27] you abiding how do they abide by the
[1:48:30] kingdom of God come into our life when
[1:48:33] the kingdom is already established in
[1:48:36] your heart then everything else
[1:48:41] above all now I want you to watch them
[1:48:45] now the kingdom must continue to extend
[1:48:50] you don't get in the promised land and
[1:48:52] you stay right there when you get in the
[1:48:54] promised land you start conquering
[1:48:56] that's why brother Branham say the
[1:48:57] promised land is the top of the holy
[1:49:00] spirit because it's fighting started
[1:49:03] you must fight for every entrance you
[1:49:06] must see which territory is not occupied
[1:49:09] yet and you need to attack and launch
[1:49:12] the attack in order to recuperate the
[1:49:15] territory that belongs to you because
[1:49:18] the film is still occupy You by birth
[1:49:21] now it's time for you to draft them out
[1:49:25] foreign
[1:49:26] [Applause]
[1:49:38] [Applause]
[1:49:47] and you can't function well in school
[1:49:50] they need to get up
[1:49:52] you must get possession of everything
[1:49:56] [Applause]
[1:49:59] everybody okay so far everybody good
[1:50:05] the Bible say if my word about you then
[1:50:09] do what ask
[1:50:10] what you
[1:50:12] because you already have the kingdom and
[1:50:15] and it shall be done to you herein is my
[1:50:20] father's house glorified
[1:50:23] so why are you asking you are glorifying
[1:50:26] God
[1:50:27] because your sickness doesn't glorify
[1:50:29] him
[1:50:30] but your headache don't glorify him no
[1:50:32] sir
[1:50:34] your depression doesn't glorify him
[1:50:38] it's bringing reproach
[1:50:44] ES
[1:50:45] [Applause]
[1:50:48] everybody okay that you bear much water
[1:50:52] fruit so you shall be how my disciples
[1:50:55] first the kingdom must be established
[1:50:58] when the kingdom are established seeking
[1:51:01] face the kingdom then what everything
[1:51:04] else must be what so when we receive the
[1:51:07] Holy Spirit I'm insisting it is only a
[1:51:10] starting point
[1:51:12] if you got the new birth praise the Lord
[1:51:14] you need to now investigate your life
[1:51:18] you need to perform an audit
[1:51:21] which area in my life
[1:51:23] is not functioning properly
[1:51:26] because God wants me to prosper
[1:51:29] [Applause]
[1:51:30] in every area
[1:51:32] which area is now receiving God the way
[1:51:35] it should be
[1:51:37] amen because Israel their clothing
[1:51:40] receives God their shoes receive God
[1:51:43] even their peace to a blessed
[1:51:46] no dog was Barren in Israel not even the
[1:51:51] rabbit was buried if you own a rabbit in

[2:03:43] treasure in water heaven and come and do
[2:03:46] what follow me God gave this young man
[2:03:49] an opportunity

[2:04:14] seek me first
[2:04:17] spoken word okay you ready
[2:04:21] but when the young man heard that
[2:04:24] saying he went away how sorrowful for he
[2:04:28] had water great possessions
[2:04:32] so this young man
[2:04:33] loved his possession more
[2:04:38] than Jesus Christ
[2:04:40] let's go slowly I know what you're
[2:04:42] fighting I know don't worry when I sit
[2:04:44] at home I can get your your vibration
[2:04:48] coming up and the Holy Spirit give me
[2:04:49] this is what you talk this is what you

[2:04:54] this one comes give this antibiotic so I
[2:04:57] know okay okay all right he says then
[2:05:01] said Jesus to his disciple verily
[2:05:05] I say to you that a rich man say amen
[2:05:10] amen
[2:05:12] shall hardly
[2:05:14] enter into the kingdom of water Heaven
[2:05:17] say amen amen you see how everybody say
[2:05:20] Amen
[2:05:21] because this one you want to believe
[2:05:23] this quickly yes the rich man ah so let
[2:05:27] me stay where I am so I can get in
[2:05:29] heaven you will be poor going to hell
[2:05:35] the problem is your heart you can be
[2:05:38] poor if you drinking and you're doing
[2:05:40] what is wrong you're going to have
[2:05:44] can I continue
[2:05:46] now let's talk a little bit here this
[2:05:48] young man Jesus asked him for something
[2:05:51] he loved
[2:05:54] please take your filter away let me
[2:05:56] preach and the young man when he looked
[2:05:59] at that he evaluated he looked at what
[2:06:02] he have he looked at Jesus Christ he
[2:06:05] said me losing all of this and following
[2:06:08] Jesus Christ he said no
[2:06:10] I can't do that
[2:06:13] this young man end up in hell
[2:06:18] can I continue
[2:06:20] the problem is that's where we stop let
[2:06:24] me go from before the foundation of the
[2:06:26] world
[2:06:28] H Jesus say father
[2:06:31] all that you have given me
[2:06:34] I have lost none acceptable one who the
[2:06:40] son of tradition the son of hell
[2:06:43] so Judah even though he had the ministry
[2:06:46] he came from hell
[2:06:48] Judah was unredeemable
[2:06:53] even if you take the Holy Ghost you put
[2:06:56] it in Judah the Holy Ghost will come out
[2:06:59] because there is nothing in Judah to
[2:07:02] receive to suck the Holy Ghost follow me
[2:07:06] carefully
[2:07:07] if this Rich Young Ruler went to hell it
[2:07:12] means that to begin with
[2:07:17] let's leave his money alone to begin
[2:07:20] with
[2:07:21] from the origin he was not a child of
[2:07:25] God
[2:07:27] do you follow me
[2:07:29] do you follow me it is not his ma his
[2:07:34] money that put him to hell
[2:07:36] it is the condition of his heart
[2:07:39] from the beginning he was not a child of
[2:07:43] God
[2:07:44] so no matter how much opportunity they
[2:07:46] will give it to him he will reject him
[2:07:49] I know you fighting me but let me help
[2:07:51] you out one day God asked Abraham
[2:07:58] Abraham waited and suffered 25 years to
[2:08:02] have one child
[2:08:04] when he has that child he loves Isaac
[2:08:08] everywhere I say give me mercy give me
[2:08:10] magic god look he said Abraham
[2:08:15] I need something from you
[2:08:17] Abraham said yeah I I have many goats
[2:08:20] there I have many sheep there I have
[2:08:23] many cows there God said
[2:08:26] that's not what I like
[2:08:28] I'm the one who's gonna tell you what I
[2:08:30] like
[2:08:31] Abraham said oh oh go ahead father my
[2:08:34] house you bless me so much go ahead God
[2:08:36] say look what you have behind it
[2:08:40] you mean God say yes
[2:08:44] Isaac
[2:08:45] you say Isaac you say give me Isaac did
[2:08:49] Abraham refuse why didn't Abraham refuse
[2:08:52] and why is the Rich Young Ruler refusing
[2:09:02] everybody okay everybody okay riches you
[2:09:06] can replace it but how are you going to
[2:09:09] replace a child
[2:09:11] [Applause]
[2:09:13] [Music]
[2:09:15] why is zebra come when they say give it
[2:09:18] Abraham that's a reason he said hey take
[2:09:21] it
[2:09:21] take what a child the only begotten
[2:09:28] if he had ten children you say yes I
[2:09:31] understand he got the only one
[2:09:34] why is Abraham yes and the Rich Young
[2:09:37] Ruler no
[2:09:40] which is they can take it away and give
[2:09:42] it back to you but if they take the
[2:09:44] child they kill him how are they going
[2:09:46] to bring him back to life
[2:09:49] so who has more faith
[2:09:51] why did abrahami works
[2:09:54] and they are the one who didn't work why
[2:09:57] why did it work
[2:09:59] and watch Abraham before Abraham gave
[2:10:03] Isaac
[2:10:04] Abraham say something
[2:10:09] are you following me I don't want you to
[2:10:12] miss what I'm about to deliver
[2:10:14] are you following me Abraham said God
[2:10:17] said give Isaac Abraham say Isaac he
[2:10:20] said no problem Abraham pick him up he
[2:10:22] said well he said where I show you
[2:10:25] well I have a GPS just follow Abraham
[2:10:28] said no problem let's go let's go
[2:10:31] Abraham reached there before he looked
[2:10:33] at the mountain he said over there God
[2:10:34] say over there that's where you kill him
[2:10:36] Abraham look he say
[2:10:39] you two wait
[2:10:40] me
[2:10:42] and DC Isaac here
[2:10:44] we are going
[2:10:46] they're going was to kill him
[2:10:49] but we will return
[2:10:53] [Applause]
[2:10:56] in other words Abraham knew that
[2:11:00] whatever he gives to God
[2:11:03] [Music]
[2:11:06] yeah
[2:11:07] he want music
[2:11:09] [Applause]
[2:11:13] because in heaven no more entity
[2:11:16] Abraham understood that he forgive it to
[2:11:19] him I'm not really losing anything
[2:11:24] it is the best insurance
[2:11:27] he's in good hand
[2:11:30] if I give him to God
[2:11:33] don't worry he means I will get it back
[2:11:39] do you follow me do you follow me
[2:11:42] Abraham knew that if I give you Isaac
[2:11:46] take it
[2:11:47] to begin with who gave it to me Isaac
[2:11:49] it's you so you want him take it bad and
[2:11:53] no I will get him back because there is
[2:11:55] a promise connected to this child
[2:11:59] everybody okay everybody good but the
[2:12:02] Rich Young Ruler refuse and God look he
[2:12:05] said
[2:12:06] it is difficult for rich people
[2:12:09] hold on righty I know what you're
[2:12:12] thinking
[2:12:13] where are we at we are in verse 19. Job
[2:12:16] to verse
[2:12:18] job to verse 24.
[2:12:22] and I and again I say to you it is
[2:12:25] easier for a camel to go through the eye
[2:12:28] of a needle then for a water a rich man
[2:12:31] to enter into the water the kingdom of
[2:12:33] God if we stop here I know what you're
[2:12:36] going to go home with it but let me help
[2:12:38] you
[2:12:39] you there
[2:12:40] when his disciple heard that
[2:12:43] follow me they were extremely
[2:12:46] exceedingly how amazing everybody say
[2:12:48] whoa
[2:12:51] I thought the disciple were poor
[2:12:55] why wait they're worrying about the
[2:12:56] Richer
[2:12:58] not getting to heaven
[2:13:01] the disciple were poor they already left
[2:13:03] everything but when Jesus is talking
[2:13:05] that it's hard for a rich man to get to
[2:13:07] heaven the disciples say whoa why are
[2:13:09] you worrying you don't have money
[2:13:11] you should be even happy Oh Praise the
[2:13:13] Lord we will not have money so we will
[2:13:16] be going to heaven the rich go into hell
[2:13:21] can I continue
[2:13:25] but when Jesus beheld they say who then
[2:13:28] can be saved
[2:13:30] why do they question the Salvation if
[2:13:33] they attack the rich
[2:13:36] why
[2:13:37] why watch verse 26 but Jesus beheld them
[2:13:42] and said to them with man it is how
[2:13:45] impossible but With God all things are
[2:13:48] how possible what seems to be hard for
[2:13:51] you

[2:13:55] follow me carefully my friend because

[2:14:16] a rich young ruler came
[2:14:19] and came to God say I need eternal life

[2:14:25] what you have follow me
[2:14:27] put me first before your money the rich
[2:14:30] man say no I cannot do that he turned
[2:14:33] his back Jesus said it is hard for the
[2:14:35] rich people to get in heaven the
[2:14:37] disciples say my God so who's going to
[2:14:39] go to heaven
[2:14:40] Jesus say hey if it's impossible to you
[2:14:43] God nothing is impossible in other words
[2:14:46] it's not your problem
[2:14:48] okay then Pete they say ah as a matter

[2:22:12] in other words God pays back
[2:22:22] let's handle this now let's go to mark
[2:22:24] 10. and let's drop the antatomic bomb
[2:22:27] now
[2:22:29] we already understood this right
[2:22:31] let's go to mark 10.
[2:22:34] I'm good in time
[2:22:37] if you're there you can say Amen
[2:22:39] Mark 10 if you dare you can say Amen the
[2:22:42] same story
[2:22:44] remember in Matthew Jesus said it's hard
[2:22:48] for your what rich man a rich man
[2:22:51] the way we interpreted is somebody who
[2:22:54] has money
[2:22:56] so if you have money you have a hard
[2:22:58] time going to the heaven let's see what
[2:23:01] Jesus say
[2:23:02] okay
[2:23:04] okay are you with me according to
[2:23:07] Matthew
[2:23:08] if you have money you have a hard time
[2:23:10] going to heaven that's what he said
[2:23:12] right let's see what Jesus said
[2:23:15] marks chapter 10 if you dare you can say
[2:23:17] Amen job to verse 21. same story then
[2:23:22] Jesus beholding him love him and say one
[2:23:25] thing you lack go your way sell
[2:23:28] whatsoever you have and give to the poor
[2:23:31] and you shall have treasure in heaven
[2:23:33] and come take up your cross and do what
[2:23:35] follow me and he was sad at that same
[2:23:38] and went away grieved for he had water
[2:23:41] great possession not Abraham watch
[2:23:44] carefully you there and Jesus look
[2:23:48] around about and say to his disciple
[2:23:50] hardly shall dead I have riches enter
[2:23:54] into the kingdom of water God
[2:23:57] and the disciples were astonished at his
[2:24:00] word but Jesus answered again and said
[2:24:04] to them Jesus explained what he said
[2:24:08] in Matthew Matthew didn't give us this
[2:24:12] Matthew only said whoever have riches
[2:24:14] that's it but Mark said I'm a pastor
[2:24:19] I'm the ox of the team I'm gonna tell
[2:24:22] you something that Matthew forgot
[2:24:24] Matthew forgot the part that Jesus
[2:24:26] explained who's rich don't go to heaven
[2:24:31] okay
[2:24:33] everybody okay
[2:24:36] verse 24 and the disciple where
[2:24:38] astonished his word but Jesus answered
[2:24:40] again and say to them children
[2:24:44] my brother you there yes sir yes sir how
[2:24:46] hard it is for them that trust in water
[2:24:51] reaching not just riches
[2:24:54] now we clear
[2:24:55] now we clear say amen amen so the
[2:24:59] problem is not a rich man is a man that
[2:25:02] trusts
[2:25:05] riches
[2:25:07] am I reading a different Bible
[2:25:09] am I reading a different Bible
[2:25:11] the problem was not the richest it was
[2:25:15] trusting in the riches put the stop put
[2:25:19] your finger on your Bible like this go
[2:25:22] to First Timothy six we read it last
[2:25:25] week
[2:25:26] I have to go this way
[2:25:28] First Timothy chapter six
[2:25:31] if you're there you can say Amen
[2:25:33] remember the problem is the rich who
[2:25:35] does what trust in riches okay let's go
[2:25:38] to First Timothy chapter six we read it
[2:25:41] last week if you dare you can say amen
[2:25:43] amen let's go to verse 17. my brother
[2:25:45] full force let's go
[2:25:57] do you see that
[2:25:59] but in water the Living God who does
[2:26:03] what giveth us rich leaves
[2:26:06] enjoy everybody clear everybody clear
[2:26:10] let's go back to Mark now
[2:26:12] now Paul said you who are rich do not
[2:26:16] put your trust in the witches put your
[2:26:19] trust in God but that girl that I'm
[2:26:22] talking about give us richly everything
[2:26:26] to enjoy
[2:26:30] I don't know if you get what I'm saying
[2:26:35] everybody good so the problem with the
[2:26:38] Rich Young Ruler it is not riches Jesus
[2:26:41] explained that it is their trust in the
[2:26:44] riches instead of trusting in them God
[2:26:47] if he was the son of Abraham he would
[2:26:50] have understood that whatever I give
[2:26:52] away I will get it back
[2:26:54] [Applause]
[2:26:56] if I gave Isaac away I'm getting it back
[2:26:59] if whatever job was taken of God doubled
[2:27:05] everybody okay
[2:27:08] um
[2:27:09] verse 24 children how hard is he for
[2:27:13] them that trust in which is to enter
[2:27:15] into the kingdom of water it is easier
[2:27:18] for a camel to go through the eye of a
[2:27:20] needle than a rich man to enter into the
[2:27:23] kingdom of water heaven now let's drop
[2:27:25] to Peter drop to verse 28 to save time
[2:27:28] then Peter begin to say to him after
[2:27:31] that again remember we heard with
[2:27:34] Matthew
[2:27:34] right Peter say ah
[2:27:37] so he refused we didn't refuse
[2:27:41] what do we get verse 28 Peter begin to
[2:27:46] say to him law
[2:27:48] we have left out
[2:27:50] and have followed you
[2:27:53] Jesus answered and said follow me
[2:27:55] carefully now
[2:27:57] verily I say to you there is no man that
[2:28:01] have left water house or water Brethren

[2:28:28] houses and water bread and water and
[2:28:32] water and water children and water land
[2:28:35] push the brick
[2:28:37] what I'm trying to say is this
[2:28:40] because I want you to get me this is
[2:28:43] Jesus giving the promise that if you
[2:28:47] give me something
[2:28:48] and you put me first I must return a
[2:28:52] hundred percent
