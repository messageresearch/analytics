TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we have with the other churches God have mercy on WE poor miserable Pharisees what we need is the power of the Holy Ghost back into the buildings and back into the people that that have the oldfashioned Pentecostal power that clean the church from the janitor to the pastor amen that's what we need but we pray for it and when it comes oh no that interferes with my social standing oh sure cuts down some of the dignity if you don't have it just so and so the people won't come Jesus said no man can come to me except my father draw him notice again all that the father give me will come keep the thing clean we can't never compare with the world we're doing wrong but trying to act like the world we're never can't compare with them and we've got no business out on their grounds bring them over on our grounds we got something they haven't got we go to act like them then they know we we're saying something we have in God let the let the world come to us not us go out a the world let the world you know Hollywood shines but the gospel glows there's a lot of difference between shining and glowing glow not shine with the outward appearance glow on the inside by the Holy Ghost with sweetness meekness gentleness patience and love glow don't shine shines after the world the church is oh like like it was in the days of Esther Esther didn't take the perfuming of of the women she adorned himself with a modest apparel the hidden man of the heart and the King said put the crown on her head Esther was a type of the church today those who are ready to come out and Adorn themselves with the sweetness of the Holy Spirit not the perfuming and the dressing of the world try to compare with them but that hidden man of the heart that's the one notice we find Jesus sitting out there

[Music] all [Music] are believe Lord I believe Lord I believe [Music] Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I believe Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I be amen I greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ God richly bless you all we thank the Lord who have given us this opportunity in this place in his presence my presence here tonight I know that it's God's will that's why I start first by thanking the lord who Inspire your pastor to invite me behind his sacred desk and I thank him from the bottom of my heart sincerely the last time I was here and the pastor and the whole church you really welcome us very well we went back to the con with a great impression from this church and now again we back again as it seems like brother Steven have done something more every time since we here he always call check on us trying to make sure we comfortable and my heart can testify of it may God richly bless him and thank you you also for to the entire church let's start by uh praying heavenly father father you made possible this meeting tonight if you open the door it's because you have something good that you have prepared for your children that's why why Lord we are are giving oursel unto thee surrendering and waiting everything from thee just one word from thee Lord it's more than a thousand word receive somewhere else because in your word there is life there is Deliverance there is a blessing there is an anointing there is everything that could be precious for a Believer that's why we are surrendering ourselves into because we would like from the beginning to the end of this service we want to be totally under the control of the spirit that's why we expecting from you and we are surrendering ourselves unto the hand we want for the Holy Spirit to teach us T father open our understanding so that we can catch your vision your thoughts in all its depth in the name of Jesus Christ we thank you and ask it Lord amen amen God richly bless you you might be seated a little bit first as I said I really thank brother Steven to open the door so that I can Minister tonight when I say this day because it's a special [Music] day it's a day that is followed by a great holiday here in the United States Thanksgiving that's how you usually call it Thanksgiving but in French we say thanksging that's the way we pronounce it in French so it's a fa it's a it's it's a Hool day that we all honored because it's a holiday where we remember the goodness of the Lord throughout the year and I am fully convinced that's it's an attitude of thankfulness toward God because we call that a Thanksgiving and why such a holiday in the United States I know that it's not only to the United States but even in Canada they they honor the same and it's a different date of course because in the United States is the fourth Thursday of the month called the Thanksgiving it's not a surprise to us because we can bring everything back to the word and brother Bram even explained to us that's the United State based its value upon the word of God because since then we always see the president of the United States having enough with his hand upon this the Bible so in the past years it was a Christian Nation but we know that since a certain time drifted a little bit away from the word but even though there is still some ruin some leftover there is still some trace of Christian values in the life of American people you will find it because when you come to the United States everybody is nice kind want to serve one another everybody is ready to say thank you for a Christian this bring you to a meditation it's showing that these people this American people have inherited something even though the nation drifted away but there still something the custom you can see there is something there still values in the United States that Christianity and we really appreciate that personally I'm not here to but when I went to Europe and when I came to the United States and compare the two you can see the difference the attitude here is different here people are very close to the gospel very close to the Christian values here in the United States compared to Europe so you know that to say thanks thank you to Lord that's something that belongs to the children of God to be grateful it's a sign of humility it's also a sign of love amen and for us Christian we don't have a specific day to thank the Lord every day of our life we always express to the Lord our feelings and our thankfulness and then our acknowledgement remember not only every day because each day you can pray three four five times and every time you go to prayer always a Thanksgiving in your prayer amen that's why for us Thanksgiving is every day the simple F the simple thank you Lord you wake up in the morning thank you Lord coming back from work thank you Lord they give you food thank you Lord before you go to bed thank you Lord you wake up in the middle of the night thank you Lord amen amen that's why we Believers we will never thank God enough there won't be a time in your life where you will say I thank the Lord L never every time your heart is beating you should say thank you [Applause] Lord mer Jes thank you Lord Jesus mer thank you when we are thinking about what happened in sometime we behave like uh crazy people that's right why because it's our life that's why our father made us when we think about what we were before message we were like bums but the Lord have picked each one of us and the Lord shaped us and now we become partaker of his divine nature and I would like to say something ungratefulness today it's a sign of the end time ungratefulness because the scripture says that in the last day people will be unthankful they will be without religion they will be enemy of people of good and this is what we are witnessing and in this time that we live brother Bram says that it's rare for you to find love and you will find true love only where true Christian are that's why the true Thanksgiving always come on only from the believer because people will begin to Feast some will be taking beers right some will be drinking alcohol some will go to a prostitute house people will be telling lies we will see women dress ill in know wrong way and it becomes just a custom without but for us when we say thank you to the Lord we are bringing it from the bottom of our heart and God himself can witness that we are expressing unto him our true feeling oh Lord this is where I'm going to base my sermon tonight I'm going to read in the sermon Watchman of and I'm going to use this as a foundation listen to what brother Bram says brother Bram says this I believe you still following Watchmen word of the night November 1958 Jeffersonville in Jeffersonville brother Bram says this in paragraph 98 brother Bram was praying actually he say at this time that darkness is upon the face of the Earth where everywhere is speaking of Destruction Lord God we are we don't even know how to express our feelings our Thanksgiving an an acknowledgement from our heart from the very fact that Christ came down from glory and was made flesh human being like us and he dwelt and live among us and then when he died for our sins he went through paradise and he took the souls that were waiting for him he broke he broke every spiritual powers that the devil was banding the Earth and he opened way that the light of the Eternal grace of God May shine upon those that would like to receive it people that were predestinated to receive that that's why we say thank you Lord and even the sermon that I'm just about to it's a way to express my Thanksgiving to the Lord that's why myself let me start and I'm going to say Thank You Lord thank you Pastor and thank you Church may God richly bless you let's go straight to our scripture let's go straight to the scripture Matthew Matthew chapter 13 verse 10 and 11 Matthew 13 10 and 11 10 and 11 and then 16 17 the disciple came and said unto him why speakest thou unto them in Parables he answered and said unto them because it's given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it's not given this is a privilege the Lord have given to us do you know when you say Amen it means so be it it's another way to say Thank You [Music] Lord parag says verse 16 and 17 but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they he for verily I say unto you that many prophet and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them and to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard them Paul would like to hear what you hear evenes and Elijah all of them he was not given unto them only unto us oh oh Lord Jesus oh oh Jesus sometimes it put you into a sitation where you want to cry sometime you want to roll on the floor because it's so great John chapter 2 The Book of John chapter John Chapter 2 Verse 18 to verse 20 then answer the Jews and say unto him what son showest thou unto us seeing that that does these things Jesus answered and say unto them destroy this Temple and in three days I will raise it up since Coral people will always have a caral understanding watch what they're going to reply then they say the Jews 46 years was this temple in building and will die we it up in three days but he spake of the Temple of his body when therefore he was risen from the dead his disciple remembered that he said this unto them scripture and the word which Jesus has said all of this the words of God the secrets of God it's only for his seed let's go to John 5 the Bible says search the scripture for in them you think you have eternal life and they are day which testify of me and you will not come to me that you might have life let's go to John Chapter 2 uh chapter 12 I'm going to pull them up together as John 12: 20 and there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast the same came therefore to philli which was a bsid of Galilee and desired him saying sir we would see Jesus that's why to see Jesus you must always have someone to lead in this age William Mar Bram l to Jesus that's why the Jesus that we are worshiping it's not the same Jesus that denomination are worshiping they are looking at Jerusalem Jesus that we are worshiping is not he is in the midst of us amen have the letter but we we have the Revelation and the Bible says that the letter kth it's the spirit that make life hallelujah hallelujah Philip cometh and tell Andrew and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus now listen to the answer of Jesus and Jesus saying the hour is come that the son of man should be glorified verily verily and say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die but if he dies he bringeth forth much fruit the Greek that came to see Jesus and then Jesus begin to talk to them about Bad Seeds agriculture if a gra wood if a corn of wheat doesn't fall on the ground and dies they were lost completely but we know what it means amen amen Jesus oh Jesus let's go to Revelation one I'm going to add one more and then I would let you sit we already prayed Revelation 1 verse 6 Revelation 1 verse 6 listen to this I believe you are with me I'm looking for verse six amen and has made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen you might be seated we already prayed the last scripture that I will go is the book of Zechariah at the end at the evening time they should be like you already know that Zechariah 14:7 and my sermon the title tonight is the Golden Age and this title I got it from Brother I was inspired by brother bram's quot and I tried to study in the message brother called this age the Golden Age so tonight together let's discover one brother Bram says this in the book of the church Ages page 34 brother Bram says this we yes page 34 seven Church edes what is brother brandham saying he says he say there are certain truth that we must insist upon it are truth that we must insist on it amen amen and I would like to tell you this that the message about the Seven Seals it's not destinated to the it's not destinated to the denomination for the of the end time that's why brother Bram says in the message God only chosen place that's the of the end time is not from it's true we are in the age of but we are already came out because whatever happened in doesn't matter to us because we receive a message which is a calling what kind of calling it's a calling to come out and this message is taking us out of and it's placing us into a mystery which is the mystery of the going [Applause] away that's why you will well understand why did I use the title The Golden Age event made clear by prophecy brother paragraph 56 we are not living in a Pentecostal age listen to me carefully for the Salvation of the Nations God uh already predestinated seven Church ages from ephes all the way to it's seven but brother that we are not in a pcal age we are living in another age every time God sent the promise on Earth God is always on time to fulfill it but every time God to fulfill his promise God is always his people is the one being that's why to every time it's always a long suffering in over time in Egypt God say 400 years but there was 40 more years because when God is the people was even in this coming of he already passed through why because we were not ready yet I want you to be [Applause] [Music] ready hallelujah amen amen that's why brother say we are not living in a Pentecost it doesn't mean that we have another age that is following pente no because there will we call them the 11 worker those that are coming late the message thatw it is not the message of Pentecost it's the message of the seven SE it is the since the after the seven Church ages this is why we are living in another age it's not a Methodist we are living in another age we are in the Brad age where the church is called to come out and it's gather for the rupture it is the message that is gathering it is the message that is uniting us the ration the body amen amen hallelujah I believe you listening and you're understanding this that's why we are in the period to in a season to come out this is the age we're living in clearly brother I believe this is the truth and in paragraph 62 brother Bram says this he said now with patience we must wait for this because the prophecy that were given all of them must be fulfilled at their time now they have predicted these things because the author did it before do you know the author it's the Lord Jesus Christ and we are expecting him to do it again what kind of time we living in it's like a calendar when you look at the calendar you want to make sure which day you you are living in and the same way you are Consulting the Bible to see in which age you are living in we are not living in a Methodist or a Baptist we are in the broad Age The Calling to bring her back to God through a channel that he promised to use to bring the Brad back what is that channel William Mar [Music] BR that's why when I'm talking I don't have a new message to give [Applause] you the work ofion for letter by letter Willi [Applause] Mar nothing to add nothing to take away if it's a and somebody saying there is you need to swallow that come from Brother take it no one have a right to correct a major [Applause] prophet brother I love not because he's a great he believe everything that is he believe everything that I said even though brother was not understanding he always say amen that's why we here in this time either [Applause] nothing amen amen if you want to agree with me repeat brother this is the only Channel when he had the vision when he had the vision says that the fit his hand and only his hand harmonize with the sword not not me not you only his hand [Applause] fit amen amen amen amen amen amen amen we cannot correct God said that we are living in the calling out time and it's putting us in the mystery of the departure explain that in the Feast of the trumpet listen to me carefully in this Natural Life to respect somebody really good you must know that person first you must have a revelation about that person that's why you might meet the governor of North Carolina if you don't know him you might greet him like anybody else and sometime he will be the one greeting you he will say hey and you say hello and you just walk out walk away why because you don't know who he is but if somebody tells do you know who just pass you back that's the government that's the government of North do you know what you will change your your your behavior quickly you will change your behavior quickly amen amen yes because when you have the revelation of the person it brings confidence at if I knew this I would have explained him or asked him some questions and if you have a chance to meet him again the second time you will change your attitude you will change your attitude do you know why denomination are the way they are brother say domination are against God they are what they are have the true revelation of the God they're worshiping they are in the history but we we are in the actuality the very thing am M if you read the message brother BR was speaking Jesus in the East can you give that to a Pentecost what is the Jesus of the the Jesus of the East is the man that was born out of Mary in that body the fullness of the godhead was B and he only worked in Israel his ministry was only work in isra and he stopped there in but the Jesus that came on the on the west who is it is not the body physical body is the spirit of the Lord that was making that body that the body of Jesus and that Spirit came then begin to seek for other vessels vessels that were predestinated and every time he found one of those vessels dwell in those vessels he would repeat the same thing in those when he was in gilee that's why the ministry of Jesus was only one person min on the West in the evening time it is in many members in you in all over the [Applause] world you cannot worship something you don't know know that in every God change mask God change fail but he doesn't change his character amen amen that's why when you have a revelation about the individual he brings confidence he brings assurance he brings conviction and [Music] determination that's why it's the same for the worship the church that we are we must have the Revelation about yourself you must know who you are when you are in this church no we we are not here because we must be in a certain Church no no that's not the reason why we here we know why we here that's why a church to worship God that church must have a revelation upon upon its message upon a revelation of of his and the revelation of your messenger and you must have also a revelation of the god you trying to worship and we must understand we are living in the most glorious age than any other age since God created heaven and earth in this earth God never sent a prophet like brother no Prophet matches brother the only one that Matti it's only John the Baptist but he was greater than John the Baptist bti because John the he didn't know the Silence of the seven seti John the Bap never even done one miracle he was kept somewhere for a Ministry for 6 month and that was it when he presented the Lord Jesus Christ that was his end God took him away but the one that we got in this end this is the revealer of the Mysteries not only the mystery even Mir even the Revelation all of them were going together amen we are living in a specific age we are living in an age where we have witnessed the Fulfillment of the sueme promise what is the Supreme promise Luke 1730 if you don't understand that Revelation your Revelation is blocked and whatever the devil is doing is to block you to recognize who you are every time the devil want you to doubt yourself that's why you will notice Judas with Jesus three years who called Jesus Lord and then at the end he sold Jesus why why he didn't have the revelation of the person of Jesus Christ he went and sold Jesus because Judah say you know this man he knows how to do miracle I just he will never let anybody stop him he will know how to get himself away he didn't know who Jesus was you might live with somebody without knowing that person you can live with this and you call him pastor but you don't really know him that's why even in a local church you don't have a revelation for your your your Revelation is [Applause] blocked you call him your pastor but you're not the only one even the people online are calling [Applause] him sometime you will see people who are unbeliever will respect him more than [Music] you he was calling AB little brother little brother he was calling him little brother know the worship he didn't have a revelation of worship he had a false Revelation about offering you understand well yes you can worship With all sincerity and yet to be wrong sry I have not even started the sermon I'm just the introduction I don't have because no Pastor ever finish his seron I don't know any Pastor that always sit and say I finish my sermon your pastor here he never finish a sermon he will start a title he preach hee just stop some and then he move on because we cannot finish God if you take God in the face of love you will never finish [Applause] God that's why when we preach we give the best when the chur and we stop glory to God we go home that's why it is not really the act of must worship with [Applause] Revelation you following me God's only chosen place of worship 1965 November the 28the preach where louisan in louisan says in his time spoke to some sincere people only the worshiper of that time sincerity alone is not enough you can be sincerely wrong the worshiper of that in do you worship me him from the bottom of their heart with all sincerity Jesus them you're doing that in vain teing for Doctrine Commandments of man in other word their Creeds from denomination they were sincere full of respect so religious it didn't start with Pharisees only we can see the same attitude today being manifested when we looking at and the first two worshiper that you see was SOC as much sincere as AB was but he lacked Revelation lack of revelation will bring [Music] anger that's why he killed because revelation bring the freshness of deity on an individual upon an individual amen amen are you still following me that's why brother says this when I will start my sermon I'll tell you in the message invisible Union 243 brother say a man born of God a Son of God must have the nature of God he must be like God he honors God he's a part of the word of God and in this last day that this has been formed with the power that he started with at the beginning and that same power went through organization and so forth and has been manifested for the bride and then she can not be anything else but that that's why today a special message we had a special messenger and we also had speci a special brother so now let me start my sermon can I start I'm skipping things so let me start my message I don't have the sermon here but I'm just let me just take what is important brother said that there is seven Junctions yes that's exactly theun the first Junction it's Noah the second Junction it's Abraham the third it's Moses the fourth it's elah of the of the time of and fifth Junction is Jesus Christ that's where I'm starting and Jesus in his he came to deal with the issue of sin that's why he died and he uh pour his blood as a a price for our Redemption listen to me care Jesus never gave us the inheritance because we were from the beginning of the world and the Bible say we are jointed her with Christ so whatever Christ came to do he who was the perfect landet who he was the prophet godet not a prophet of God Jesus was the prophet God he was the god [Applause] Prophet Jesus was not a prophet of God he was the god Prophet or God the prophet because we we we lost that inheritance when Adam gave it to the devil and Jesus when he came he came only to pay the price so that we can go back and get back to our position before the fall and that position God already gave it to us before Jesus became the Son of [Applause] God amen amen amen and the sixth Junction it was the the reformers Luther Worley and so forth and the seventh Junction is the biggest Junction more than even the junction of Jesus this is the crucial things right here how can can a Ministry be bigger because Jesus himself said that he that do greater work and he will do greater work than I do meaning if he resurrect we can resurrect and not only that brother Jesus in his time never added something out of nothing he always has a substance like maybe a bread and then he multiply or maybe some f and he multiply fishes maybe water and he the word hallelujah hallelujah it's the greatest Junction of all [Applause] Junctions that's where we are and just not that the scripture of John 14 is connected to Revelation 10 1-7 Hallelujah that's what I have been ministering somewhere else listen to me carefully the greatest Junction of all time let me read it a little bit are you following me I'm going to the invisible Union back again Canada this was printed from Canada par paragraph 32 until I want you to be very to pay attention I am grateful to God to live in this end time of the last event of this world are you following me carefully I don't know I don't know if I would have have my say before the foundation of the world that God would have given me all his plan saying I want you to preach brother now brother say if the Lord would have in which age would you like to go brother if God would have asked me that question before the foundation the before the foundation of the world and say Bram I would like to send you on Earth to preach tell me which age would you like to go on Earth listen to brother br I would have chosen this age here because I believe it's the golden age can you say [Applause] Amen never chosen the time of Jesus but you you didn't ask God himself took you and put you as a believer of this priv what a great privilege God chose you for this age I listen [Applause] 33 I would truly want to be here at his time when he was here on Earth in fifth Junction but I believe that now this is a greatest time why because this is the time that is coming to get those that he has redeemed those that Jesus redeemed in other word it's a time that the work is completed you know when there is a competition Sports and then your your team reach the final they don't put any kind of player in the final because losing we always they always choose the best in final the best team in the final and when they are making the team for the final they don't need any eror don't give room for error that's why God never by sending brother Bram in this God never made a Mist by Ching you as a brother sister Manifest this message in this time God never made a mistake about [Applause] you that's why brother Bram say today God is waiting and me word God is expecting something from us God is waiting for us amen amen are you following me yes because it's the time that is coming to get his redeem when the resurrection is is is closed the time that all the redeem will come what a glorious opportunity we have to speak to a dying people great time we areed about it it's in this time that God is calling you Christian that you are being called a Christian that's why I was telling you we of this age when we understand our position even if you walking alone you just say thank you Lord thank you Lord thank you Lord and then sin itself will get away from you sin will run away from you when you just say than you God cannot God cannot you God can never call you without being without already being equiping you to win the devil in this time is greater than the time of Jesus in the time of Jesus devil only had an experience of 4,000 but in this timean have an experience for six that's why God reinforce the of this with the word that's why in this we have the fullness of the word that's why brother we have the we we are in the time of the double portion because our Lord know in this devil will be worse than any other age and then to mat the devil God will equip his bride and now we the become the word word listen to me Jesus one time went to the for 40 years and devil went to tempt and brother said when the devil tempted he say he never used a gift to win the devil to overcome the devil he only Ed it's written it's written and in this have sopped the fullness of the word listen to me Care in the beginning was word and the Word was with and the Word was God and the word in the make you God that's why God is on Earth today in human beings yes God is already on Earth you canot have the word without having [Applause] [Music] God listen to me carefully why denomination why because the devil in the in the portion of the word that they lacked and that's why but in this anything we if the devil come here we are there here are if he goes here we are there if he touches here we and we say it's written he goes there we say we reply back it's also written Hallelujah that's why brother this message never be a denomination after this message denomination that's why we are in the mystery of the Rapture the work is already [Applause] done you know what gold means means what always speak about the gold age of [Music] deity they went to see the Child Jesus the ma brought three and every gift have because God was was service and then mer spoke of death service to die that's why in this it's only the in other words it's manifesting himself in human beings that's why brother says that since God came down he never left the Earth say [Applause] that God is because you are on [Applause] earth when we the will leave this it will be a greatest catastrophe brother do never miss the Rapture don't miss the Rapture don't don't be caught up into the things don't be blinded by by worldly pleasure don't be do not be blanded by by men civilization brother Bram was born in he was an americ but he was not living like an American he was living like a Christian in this message there is no americ no French no Eng no Brazilian no African it's only children of God and our nationality we are only heavenly bodies [Applause] amen he say it's a great time we areed about and we know that history is closing out the world history will come to be over going to step into a new day to the great millenum that as one believer I believe in a millennium a millennial Reign Christ for, years Earth phical Return of the Lord Jesus to take a physical people GL glorify by his cleansing blood that's why every child of God that is living in this message you are living in the glorified why because it's the time of adoption Transfiguration it is the time of transformation amen amen now you begin to understand why is it a golden age you begin to understand now yes says this in modern event made clear by prophecy I'm just going to read somewhere here yes I believe that you are ready listen to me carefully more than event made clear by prophecy paragraph 2 and three he say I was expressing like brother Henry says listen to me carefully these men these men that have hair like women should have because this time today we have a world upside down we are men with long hair and women are cutting hairs it's a confusion brother says that's uh earrings all this time of earrings it's a sign of heathenism but today you see even men with earrings it's so complicated to tell is this a man or a woman men want to be like women women want to be like men so confusing yeah they change values you say those men with them hair like women should have you look like I see trying to have their kind of hair they even put those roller curlers around their face I don't know sometime I became discouraged I took my wife and the children to a a shop and and I saw a woman I said I told my wife I said is she naked Pap my my daughter Sarah say daddy you have not seen the worst Yet brother says here you follow me he say I was I became discouraged it look like a true time of perversion because when Grace AB sin also ab ab so just be careful don't be sucked into those foolishness men are trying to wear women's cloth and women wearing men's clothes and Men leaving their hair like women and women having hair like men really the very thread of decency and honor left this nation and these people this world now listen to brother Bram now after he he say this is a horrible time but it is the most glor it is the most glorious time in the world to preach the gospel if it's a glorious it's a message glorious he must be a glorious prophet he must be a glorious bride everything must be glorious and brother say when Jesus himself was there was not even one% in Israel knew that God was on Earth that's Jesus was walking and they were cing they said look at him a Bast child look look a Bast child that that child do you know about his mother he went and she got before she she was married and it's that man that took over the shame the reproach but when Peter was looking and are telling me and Andrew they say you are the Holy One Of [Applause] God that's why us no matter what the world no matter how that much they critici as a matter of fact even reinforce our position because the devil must fight [Applause] him even you even yourself the devil stop fighting you it means he won you but if you are always it means he has not got you [Applause] yet amen amen amen it's the most glorious time to preach the gospel and today how many people in this United States knows that God send a prophet how many people today and that Prophet is an American how many American people know maybe 20% how many American are here let me see your hands please Americans where is your hand you see it's just a few it's showing you that you are in the truth you American who are in this message you are blessed you are blessed and I'm going to tell you something you are no longer even [Applause] American yes brother say paragraph [Music] three if I could have stood before come before he come to existence and the father would have looked at me and say what time done through look through I wanted right now just right now just before he's com that's why you you cannot even you can PA or John the Baptist you cannot even desire mes you cannot even I mean desire to be they are the one to be Desiring being in this time not you if the church does not understand what God have done for the church in this time you will not be able to worship God correctly you know one thing do you know that that it is your worship that God usually uh uh Grant in heaven brother BR says brother said denomination already kick Jesus out of their churches they never done it conscious their world that kick Jesus out but they never even know that Jesus already left that's why they continue to do everything in they are singing in the name of Jesus Christ in Everything Jesus is not even minding their stuff amen and this time this is where you are Christian this is where you Christian watch paragraph 40 says this listen to me carefully I would like to change now just for one [Music] moment and to draw your attention to the king of these Eagles or these prophets all those Watchmen upon the tower when you say eag Prophet Watchmen it's the same thing because prophets are Watchmen and they are also Eagles yes it's the Lord Jesus Christ himself listen this and the day that we are living in are you following me are you following me listen this day that we are living in is more glorious than the day that Christ lived here you don't have to worry to desire to be like Peter or Andrew or the people that walk with Jesus let me tell you something do you know that let me say this do you know that today we know about Jesus Christ more than the Peter knew Jesus In the [Applause] Flesh why because Peter knew him just as on what they saw him doing and what they saw him doing after his resurrection and they stopped there but they didn't know that the spirit of will go through the ages and finish its course in the age of and then a prophet will come on the and bring up that were never been known before in any ages they didn't know about it and I'm going to tell them Jesus today is doing he never done even when he was here on Earth today don't be distracted God have given us a glorious position and we must be really thankful unto him yes says this when he was close to the Cross he spoke more about his second coming than his death if you search the scripture carefully you would notice just before his death he prophesy about things that should come in this time that's why brother Bram says the Lord Jesus Christ have more success in his ministry brother Bram Ministry than his own Ministry and brother Bram says this that what Jesus did in just in without counting other state and other count what Jesus did in Jeffersonville where brother Jesus never done so many but when the Holy Spirit did Miracle regardless of unbelief and did things just in Jeffersonville was greater than what Jesus did in his own Ministry and that it's not me it is Jesus in me that did it hallelujah hallelujah it is Jesus in me that did it amen listen seven Church ages those that come out of the bride only do his will no one can make them do [Music] other they have safe the Lord or they keep [Applause] still when brother Bram doesn't say anything we har we speak when he speak because in thise God thought spoke and the word is the expression of the thought and the word and the spoken word that is the expression of the very thoughts of God [Music] Amen they have that sa the Lord they know that it must be God in them to do the work fulfilling his own word that's why everything that God can do in you you cannot take the glory it is only God's glory why it is not theor it is not me it's not Jesus Christ Jesus in you Jesus in me it was Jesus [Applause] inam amen that's why everything that was fulfilled in the life of it's the glory of Jesus Christ but be careful in this age the bride share the glory with his groom why because today God cannot heal without me God cannot bless without God cannot save without he cannot do anything without me it is not really Jesus pray it is your pastor praying for you but when there is healing you don't go see Jesus even though it's Jesus you go back to the pastor you say thank you Pastor foraying your pray help me God heal me are glorify your [Applause] pastor that's why brother Bram says God want that they can that God desire his children to be glorified more than him Jehovah J 1962 I can give you the paragraph don't be afraid a serious Christian must speak about his must speak about theet must speak about Jesus if you do without speaking Jesus and and your pastor something you backing somewhere why you know brother Bram through your pastor and you know Jesus Through brother receive the revelation of Jesus Christ your receive it from Brother you cannot through the pastor and the prophet the ministry and the prophet and do going one day without saying the name of Jesus Christ who taugh you about Jesus Christ who tgh you about brother Bram your pastor how can you do one day Christian without even think about the P prophet of Jesus Christ how how how that God is using to give you his will he uses the pastor and the pastor present you the prophet and the prophet presented you Jesus Christ it's just a facet he's not the water he's just but you must protect the F because if the you going to have word of spilling [Applause] everywhere it's just a channel it's this guy here it's just a channel you ready uh listen Jesus on Earth never finish his work my Jesus never finished his work what he missed to do we are the one finishing up I'm going to read it to you listen he has not completed his work in his minister in his ministry here on Earth now he's working through the bride and through and that's why God is waiting for for you he's waiting upon you that's why a Christian he's seeking the will of God for his own life ask yourself a question why did God call you in this message why are you in this church why did he give you brother Steven as your pastor why what is God expecting from you if you don't know you have not worshiped [Music] good that the will of God it's a mystery and each person SE God's will for why are you in the message what is God expecting why are you in this church what is God expecting why did he give you this man as a pastor what is God expecting from you I'm sorry I'm not going to finish I'm going to stop let me read this and [Music] stop he's working and he's working through her God want to work but he cannot work without your body ask God what do you want to do I'm surrendering let th will be done and the will of God it's not always our that's why before you will forsake your own will get his will that's why [Applause] brother me the to to to to forsake to get your own will what is God expecting from is that the kind of life you living is that what things you're doing is that what God expecting from you why are you here are you really doing what God is expecting you to do yes she knows because at that time it was not the time yet to do certain things that he have to do now but now he will fulfill through the the work that he has deser reserved for this time amen and in my church I was saying this you can neglect yourself we can neglect you listen to me carefully in your house there is many bedroom uh and there is many uh many Furniture love seat you have bed you have all kind of furniture but but the chair cannot talk to the bed and say bed we don't need you in this house because the bed will and say the one who put is the one that put me also in this house you don't have to tell me anything you chair and chair you don't have to tell me you B each Furniture has it own house that knows the importance of each [Applause] Furniture you can neglect yourself we can neglect you but God knows why he brought you here God will never neglect you God knows that about his work you are important in that's why he brought you to his work amen amen God richly bless you I cannot [Applause] continue we were at the introduction and I say we can never finish even your pastor never finish a sermon may the Lord Jesus Christ richly bless you I believe the pastor will pray for you himself it is his work mer thank you very much let's stand thank you Lord everybody happy everybody happy you cannot have the word without God in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the word is God and when the word is made flesh you become God we spoke about this over and over and the Holy Spirit is coming back to tell you that you must know who you are God didn't put you in this Earth at this time just hophazardly God chose you to be the best but you don't want to acknowledge and to accept that you're the best because you are looking at your failure and you are looking at your physical being and the things that you did in the past stop looking at yourself look through the seed look at what God had in his mind accept the thoughts of God regardless of who you are in other word accept the word because God's word is more true than your thoughts amen you can have an optical illusion about yourself you can look at this carpet and you say it's green because you're suffering until you get healed then you will see correctly and the picture you looking at yourself is not the correct picture you need some glasses and the glasses that you need is the word of God without glasses you have a blur vision of yourself without this message you have a blur vision of yourself look at yourself through the filter of the world Amen through the filter of the word then you will see exactly clearly what God in intended you to do because the glasses will refocus your vision the word of God will refocus your vision and you will be looking at yourself like an overcomer versus a coward or something else because that's what the devil has been using to keep you down amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you again humbly tonight father thanking you for this Thanksgiving service that you have given us us tonight letting us know again that we are your brde we are joined her we have been chosen before the foundation of the world to be partaker of your divine nature in this same time father we didn't have the opportunity to ask you or to be asked by you about which age we should be living in you could have put us with Moses we could be probably part of the scripture tonight being read all over the world like Jonah and the other but father you heed our name even in the scripture so that the devil could not even read our name in the scripture because our name were Mysteries and you by your own counsel you determine and you chose to put us in this end time and you qualified US to be able to overcome in this age father may this Revelation be always fresh in our mind when we going through trial L when we going through our d time when things are complicated that that revelation will always flash like a beacon in the midst of Darkness Illuminating our mind that remember I chose you before the foundation of the word because I know that you can make it I know what I place in you I know the potential I know the struggle that you went through I am the one who chose you in that family I am the one who chose you to be born the way you were born I am the one who picked the trial that you're going to go through because I knew what I put in you and your trial is what will take the potential to be unfolded exactly the way as are planed because nothing will take us of God Luther was taken off God because of the portion of the word that remain mystery to him Wesley the same thing even the Pentecostal were taken down because of the mysterious part that they missed father but Lord you came and you pick all these losing and you unfolded the seals to reveal the entire word so that now there is no mysterious part that the devil can bring without the Brad being able to tackle it that's why Prophet scream and say that we have the devil answered father these things are that are not just cat they are the thoughts of God that were expressed Lord and father we want to say thank you for that and we want to commit ourself unto the hand for the remaining of this week that you continue to protect us protect us in the remaining of this week of Thanksgiving may we always remember what you did on Calvary and what you did on Sunset Mountain because sunset Mountain finished everything when you came down and broke the seals because now we are guarantee for the Rapture Lord give travel Mercy to your children bless them for this special night that they have taken Lord father in the midst of rain and slippery Road father they made it to church Lord give them a special blessing Lord protect us and heal those that are sick strengthen Lord father those that are feeble and father may you bless us exceedingly and abundantly above what we can ask Lord we humbly ask it father strengthen your man servant Lord father that labor Lord father and strengthen me as well Lord father remember this church and those that
