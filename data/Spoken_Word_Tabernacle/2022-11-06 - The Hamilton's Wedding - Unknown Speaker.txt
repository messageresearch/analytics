Genesis chapter 2 verse 7. the Bible says that and the Lord God for men Out of the Dust of the ground what I want you to remember is man of Genesis 2 came out from the dust of the ground the scripture continues and breathed into his nostril the breath of life and Man became a living soul Verse 18 the Bible continues and say and the Lord God saying it is not good that demand should be alone I will make him a help meet for him so the one who saw that God being lonely is not good it's not me and you it is God himself who saw that he was not good for man to be alone verse 19 and out of the ground again the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever Adam call every living creature that was the name thereof if you notice here the body of a man that was formed in Genesis 2 7 and the Beast and the fowl everything came out from the ground amen the Bible continue on verse 20 and Adam gives the name gave names to avocado and to all foul of the air and to every beast of the field but for Adam there was not found in helped made for him and the Lord God calls a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh he never left it open he closed it closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God has taken from man made he a woman and brought hair unto the man it was God who made the woman and took the woman and bring her back to man amen and Adam said this is now born of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh and she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh and they both were naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed from these portion of the scriptures that we read I want to speak briefly on marriage as the reflection of God marriage as the reflection of God if you open your scriptures which I don't want you to do now in the Book of Genesis Genesis started with the genealogy of the Earth it tells us how God begin to create from the first day all the way to the seventh day where God rested himself on the first day we found out that the light came out on the second day God divided the firmament on the third day the ground of the earth came out and out of the ground God began to bring grass begin to bring for our Patrice and all kind of vegetation in other words about in their life and then from there on the fourth day God spoke that there will be lights on the firmament and the Zodiac begin to be expressed on the face of the sky on the fifth day we found out that God progressing in his work and he began to create the cuddle the fishes the fowl fill up the Seas and the air was filled with four kind of birds and he created also the creeping things but I'm gonna stop right there before I can get on the sixth day and everything that God was creating from the first day all the way to the fifth day where only expressions of God the Bible says in Psalm Chapter 19 Verse 1 to 3 that the heavens declare the glory of God and The Feminine showeth his handiwork day unto day order of speech and night unto night is showeth knowledge there is no speech no language where the voice is not heard in other words everything that God created when you look at the sky there is an expression of God through the sky the Apostle Paul in Romans chapter 1 verse 20 says that for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse in other words everything that God was creating whether he was a tree whether he was a fish whether he was a farm whether he was equipping things whether he was an animal everything was only expressing God can you say Amen and then we notice here that in Genesis 2 man was made out of the Dust of the ground and Not only was Man made out of the Dust of the ground but the creeping things the animal the Beast and the fishes and the fowl everything came from the dust of the ground even though one from another are different in their species yes nevertheless everything came from the same source and the same material in Korea in First Corinthians chapter 15 verse 39 that all flesh is not the same flesh but there is one kind of Flesh of men another flesh of Beast another of fishes and another of bird but all these flesh came from one source which is the ground or the dust of the Earth in other words man of Genesis 2 7 was not in the image of God yeah the man of Genesis 2 7 was in the image of an animal the message in question and answering on Genesis in 53 brother Branham says and then he put man in the dust of the Earth which was first man Adam and that was and that man was made after the image this human man here is made after the image of the animal these human bodies are made in the image of animals amen we all are subject to corruption if a man die he wrote we must bury him if a fish die the fish rot if an animal die or a dog dies we must bury that dog if not it will stink because every flesh whether it's a man whether it's a it's a foul of the uh of the heaven whether it's a fish whether if it's creeping things everything came from one source which is the dust of the ground and all those sources are corruptible or subject to corruption in the message in Romans chapter 1 verse 23 Paul says that they change the glory of The Incorruptible God into an image made like corruptable man so man is corruptable he say in the image of a corruptable man and the bird and the four-footed Beast and creeping things so Paul here again in Romans 1 23 he's showing that every flesh is still corruptible man is corruptable animals are corruptable creeping things are corruptable fishes are corruptable birds are corruptible why because they came from the same Source they came from the dust of the earth there was only one man that could defile their law because that man was not you and me that man was the visible image of the invisible God and his name was the Lord Jesus Christ that's why the scripture said that God suffered not his body to see corruption that was the only body that could not rot and he could not rot because that was God himself made flesh in a human being everything else could rot except the body of Jesus Christ so what I'm trying to say here is everything that was created was only an expression of God but it was not the image of God if we go back now in Genesis 1 verse 26 the Bible says that God said let us create man on the sixth day in our own image and in our own likeness that is the man that was created in the image of God the animal expressed God but they were not the image of God the trees expressed God but they were not the image of God Amen the creeping things expressed God the Zodiac Express God but none of them were in the image of God that's why God was not satisfied until he could create something that looked exactly like himself amen and the Bible says in John chapter 4 verse 24 that God is a spirit so if God created man in his own image in his own likeness what kind of man was that man that man was a spirit man so the image and the likeness of God is not the man of Genesis 2 7. they imagine the likeness of God is the man of Genesis 1 26 it is a man that was made in His image in his own likeness and that man was a spirit man amen that's why when Jesus came Jesus said that man shall not live by what bread alone bread is the man of Genesis 2 7 but man shall lead by every word the man that lived by the word of God is not the man of Genesis 2 7 it is the man of Genesis 1 26. amen the image of God was created in Genesis 1 26. that's why Jesus said that woman the hour cometh and now is that the true worshiper must worship God in water in spirit because that is the image of God the true worshiper who worship God in spirit and in truth because the spirit was the image of God and if you look at that image when he came out from its own birth God never created only a man the Bible says that he created man male and female amen so from the very birth of a man out of his own Creator man came as a joint unit as a dual-being as a man that was already connected to his mate in other words from eternity we were already joined together amen what God did in Genesis 2 to take the woman and bring him to the man is only to reflect what already existed in Genesis 1. man was already drawn to his wife man was already connected to his wife mad was not could not be separated from his wife and when in Genesis 2 God separated the woman from a man that's why God instituted marriage why to bring the woman back to her position what is the position is to reflect God because God also is male and female that's why he created man in his own image male and female that's why marriage is an instituted of God everybody that's why marriage started as the first thing in the Book of Genesis and marriage ended the Book of Malachi marriage started in the Book of Matthew on the first chapter and on in the Book of Revelation we also talking about the marriage of the lamb and even the first miracle that Jesus done he made it he completed that Miracle during a wedding day because wedding are special amen the Bible says in the Book of Proverbs verse 18 22 chapter 18 verse 22 the Bible said whoso foundeth a wife foundeth a good thing comma and obtain favor of the Lord so when you find a wife young man there is a favor of God that is connected to a wife that's why sometimes you will notice not only sometimes but most of the time when a man is single it looks like he's spinning around it looks like he cannot save his money he looks like everything he's doing is not stable but let that man find a good wife and you will find that men begin to prosper that man begin to Blossom why because the one who founded for wife foundeth a good thing and he obtained favor from the Lord that's why things begin to work in the marriage quickly you begin to wonder what was I doing with money but now it seems like I have responsibility yet I can still save why because the favor of God will come upon you when you find a good wife why because marriage is a reflection of God marriage is a reflection of almighty God dear beloved we are gathered here in the sight of God and in the face of this company to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony which is commended by Saint Paul to be honorable among all men it is therefore not by any to be entered into and advisably or lightly but advisably soberly and in the fear of God into this holy State this two person sister Keller and brother Charles Hamilton present come to be joined if there is any person here that can show it just cause why they should not be lawfully joined together in this holy matrimony do you now speak or from hereafter in other words forever hold your peace I give you a few seconds so I have not heard anybody so forever hush I will require forever everybody okay I will require and will charge you both as you shall surely answer at the day of judgment when the secret of All Hearts shall be disclosed that if either of you know any impediment why you should not be lawfully joined together in this matrimony do you now confess it for be it assure unto you that any couple that are joined others than God's word to allow their marriage is not lawful but duly believing that you have considered the solemn obligation that you are about to assume then that you have prepared to enter upon the same reverently disgracefully soberly and in the fear of God I shall propose to you the marriage covenant I will require the token of this

Darwin the love of my life where do I begin we met each other in 2009 when we were two broken people not looking for love but somehow the Lord saw fit to put us together we have had our ups and downs but I would do it all over again with you when I was 16 years old I prayed for my husband in specifics and by Godly the Lord Jesus Christ loved me enough he gave me every quality I asked for in you you may not have had our first but we are going to have our present and future together I love how we raise our children with Christ being our headship I love how you see God's face before every decision concerning our lives and family when I think of my Charles Allen I think of how caring you are towards others before your own needs and wants I think of how humble you are even when you should be upset I think of how acceptable you are to to my needs I think of how responsible you are with our family by leaving us to provide in Kentucky I think of how loving you are when you kiss my head as I sleep or as you leave in the middle of the night to go to work I think of how elated you get when we are running around the house playing and cracking jokes on one another during family time I think of how silly you are with us at times and how serious you get when I spend too much I say all of this to say that for the first time in my life I have found true love someone I can truly call my own I see why the Lord put us together he took two broken people and made us whole he made us whole and we are now hold together we get to share this beautiful life together and show our children what a christ-led marriage looks like with Jesus Christ leading the way we cannot fail I love you Charleston praise God [Applause] congratulations sister Kayla that was lovely go ahead brother Charles that's it my brother go ahead you can do it from the first time I met you there was a mystery about you it was an atmosphere that was always around you I could see it the most precious I was just talking and playing board games I would watch you for hours while you would walk and talked while we play games while you left even when you slept and I can never figure out what was learning in why was I so hypnotized why was I so absorbed with you why was I so mesmerized what I've learned about Mysteries is that you cannot figure them out they have to speak for themselves they have to tell you what they are they have to tell you what they mean hmm but from the very first time that you see it in the end you understand it was telling you the whole time and I missed it for years I cannot figure out what was in front of me that great something that always was around you I agree something when I looked into your eyes that great something that had me so mesmerized so hypnotized and so absorbed that great something what's that doing good was that you loved me I've heard about love all my life but now I see it I see it's unconditional and I see it in you for the rest of my life I will express to you the same love and dedication that was hidden to me but was always known to you I will preserve every moment I will shelter each and every moment at each and every memory within my heart I will treasure all of you all of your beauty all of your Joys all of your sadness all of your imperfections all of your battles all of your shortcomings any and everything that involves you I want to be there with you walking with you and embracing every moment I can because all I want is you many people don't live out their dreams or true happiness they fantasize they wish and they dream about what it could be only to realize they're living with regrets the opportunities they missed the courage that they lacked and the know-how to execute I'm living my dreams I'm embracing my happiness in you the things I fantasize and the wife have become my reality in my reality gives me no time to daydream and you have found the courage to execute any and everything that comes my way I have found courage to love beyond our disagreements and my only regrets are the opportunities that I missed to express all of my love to you from this day forward I promise a new to you to be patient when I don't understand your emotions I promise to dedicate myself to give you security and your affections I promise to be more sincere with your passions I promise to answer before you ask in those silent moments when your atmosphere is communicating to me I promise to love you with all joy and sincerity I promise to accept and carefully nurture the changes that you go through in life
