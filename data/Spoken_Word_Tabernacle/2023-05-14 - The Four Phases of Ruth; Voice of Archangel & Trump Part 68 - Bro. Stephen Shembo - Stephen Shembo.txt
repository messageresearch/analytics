her her price is far above rubies the heart of her husband doth safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil she will do him good and not evil all the days of his of her life she seeketh wool and flax and worketh willingly with her hands she's like the Merchant's ships she bringeth food her food from afar she Rises also while it is yet night and giveth meat to her household in a portion to her maidens amen she considereth a field and buy it with the fruit of her hand she planted the vineyard she girdeth her loins with strength and strengtheneth her arms she's perceived that her merchandise is good her candle goeth not out by night she layeth her hands to the spindle and her hands hold the staff she stretches out the her hand to the poor yay she reaches forth her hands to the needy She's Not Afraid of the snow for a household for her house all of her household her clothed with Scarlet she maketh herself coverings of tapestry her clothing is silk and purple hey man find linen and royalty amen her husband is known in the gates when he sitteth among the Elders of the Lamb she maketh fine linen and sellot it and delivereth girdles into the merchant strength and honor are her clothing and she shall rejoice in time to come she openeth her mouth with wisdom and in her tongue is the law of kindness she looketh well to the ways of her household and eateth not the bread of idleness her children arise up and call her blessed her husband also and he prayseth her many daughters have done virtuously but thou the bride excellent them all favor is deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman that fearth the Lord she shall be praised give her of the fruit of her hands and let her own works praise her in the gates let's give the moms a hand one more time this morning amen

ahead with that she fell asleep so uh I just wanted to thank the Lord for the last couple months yeah this is this might be a little lengthy I apologize but the before the baby was born things just started going wrong one after another our HVAC went out in our house we had to get it replaced and then we got it replaced and then um right after that our washing machine went out and then we had to get it replaced and then after we got it replaced then uh our kitchen sink started leaking water and started flooding our sink a little bit and this is all throughout a couple month period and then we fixed it well that was the whole process because it had to be custom made for our you know countertops and stuff whatever we got it fixed and then two days after I fixed the kitchen sink then a refrigerator went out which we haven't had one for a couple days and then after also in the meantime the mower that I have broke down so I couldn't mow my grass it got three foot tall it was just one thing after another after another Destiny was sick with an infection and then she got better and then she had bad allergies which turned into something else for two weeks and then the baby was on and off sick and I was like Lord I don't know what you're you're doing but I'm going to maintain a positive attitude and I'm going to just you know seek you and and just like continue to persevere and not complain not be negative we got a new vehicle and I had to sit in the driveway for two weeks because there was a title issue and it was just I was like Lord I know you know what you're doing and when Andrew Glover came and preached on Wednesday it just something struck my heart and I was like you know throughout all this process I saw myself kind of pull away from the tapes a little bit and because I was busy and stuff and I wasn't like listening the message like I used to and I was like Lord you know get me back in the tapes that I told Andrew after service I was like if that wasn't for anybody else in our church that was for me because the you know the the need for you know those tapes in our lives you know Church our walk with the Lord is in just a Sunday and Wednesday thing but it's a day-to-day thing and I was like war with the busyness of my life and the things going wrong I need to get back into the tapes well after Wednesday we got the car issue figured out we got the same fixed I got my mower started yesterday just everything falling back into place I'm like Lord I don't know why it took me so long to figure out what you were telling me but I appreciate you and God is good through it all I'm thankful for everything he's done for us and for the baby and you know just my wife and I'm just thankful for everything that God's done and just wanted to share that it was burning on my heart I was like Lord I'm not going to forget to thank you so foreign God he is in control I I did not ask permission for about this next prayer request but I was looking what

wanna remember him this morning as we pray amen if y'all could stand we're going to go before the Lord yes ma'am okay let me give you this another praise report that's what we like amen it may seem small but to our family it's great our baby son Elijah has been struggling with reading since last year we've prayed about it as a family but you know sometimes God wants to get us by ourselves and strengthen our prayer life so he got with his dad it was a burden on his heart and he talked to his dad about it and his dad's been praying with him and then he's been praying and you see his little prayer life growing he got his progress report which is fourth quarter this week and I am happy to say that he brought his grade from an F to a b and as God amen I know if I got to be I was happy amen

Tabernacle and we trust that the service will be a tremendous blessing to you Amen Brother John already covered me up but once again happy Mother's Day to all the mothers of spoken away amen amen amen and Happy Mother's Day to my mom I know somehow she will be streaming she's more up to date than many people amen glory to God you know she used to pray when she was a little that if she get a son may one of them be a preacher so being coming from a Catholic background so they took my brother first and send them to be a priest and they didn't work out he came out from there he said no I cannot be a priest and he came out from there so they were looking at me and they began to call me all kind of name they say okay this one is quiet he's probably this is the one that we go to the priest and everything and the kind of you know how parent they kind of work you up trying to go there and he didn't work up amen then I ended up being in a message and when I began to preach she realized she said okay my prayer has been answered not to be a priest but to be now a preacher under the priesthood of Melchizedek amen glory to God how many are up to date with the sermon if you didn't listen to Wednesday you need to go back and listen that was a masterpiece on Wednesday amen we're still reading our question and answer and one question a day we're still reading our Cod book we're still reading our church ages we're still reading our 70 weeks of Daniel I had somebody who is who already started the seals now okay three people started this years praise God glory to God that's what I did you do it will be okay amen it is the message of the hour these things will remove you from the air and stabilize you until you solve it and you know exactly why you believing and many of the questions brother Brian I'm already answering them in question and answer so by going through the question and answer automatically you begin to have question amen our religion is not a Catholic religion in a Catholic religion like brother Abraham explained the priest does everything and then the congregation just sit home and we do your homework in other words you send me a question I give you an answer you send me a question I'll give you an answer you don't do anything no that's not the way you work amen I'm digging the word you also are digging amen so sometime when I need a question or when I need an answer you give me the answer amen because we have the same Bible the same message book the same Cod everything is the same amen and matter of fact how are you going to know that what I'm preaching is right if you don't read the message on your own [Applause] because the disciple in Berea they always verify whether what they were preaching was coming from it that's why when I say open the Bible you all open the Bible so you can verify it for yourself that's why we put the quotes right here so everybody can see clear that this is where it comes from we don't want men opinion we don't want man idea we don't want men explanations we only want the word of God man opinion brought a lot of headache in this message amen I was talking to somebody about the message and they asked me to say what is Stephen but in this message they're preaching this they're preaching I said listen the way I'm training the church is I'm giving you the scripture and I'm giving you what brother Branham said if any preacher I don't care how big he is oh how long he has been in the message if what he says he cannot back it up by the scripture and the message of the hour you have the right to refuse it do not take it if it's his own opinion that him if it's a testimony that somebody met with Brother Branham and that testimony is not in the messages leave it right there stay with what is on the books and what is on the table everybody okay because we don't want after a few years then the testimony change then people were hanging on the testimony if you have something show me that if you give me the scripture I say Amen you give me the quote I say Amen if you don't have it I don't care how big you are I stay with what is what God told me to say amen because that is the message of the hour amen glory to God on May the 20th at 2 30 we gave the young men's meeting it's going to be here in church so please make sure everybody is on time so we can start on time amen amen patriarch okay praise God Amen on May the 27th we got a question and answer I believe brother Kelly our secret place room has been repaired so you know where it is we will send you the address again so that's where we will meet on the 27th what is the time again 2 30 2 30 so 2 30 on the 20th for the young man and two 2 30 on the 27th for question and answer amen glory to God I was talking to somebody asking me a question and I say I answer that question in the question and answer you were not there so you're bringing me question again that I already answering question and answer because you don't show up in question and answer then you come up with the same question again making me work double amen so make sure you there and everything will be okay the Deacon will let me know the next uh Wednesday prayer meeting and then for those that are waiting for music part one and two and three we finally got the software to put everything and upload the the code because it was already uh streamed and it was hard to find how to upload the code again we had to buy it's called electronic passport or something that the technician told me so just give me some time and they will upload the code they never think so we will release it amen so you listen to music part one part two part three and you know what kind of music you need to listen in the message and outside the message so don't say because the message believer the music is right it doesn't make them right you need to go by the same calibration because what is the source of their inspiration where are they getting the music for Who are they trying to imitate when they're singing are they trying to imitate the people of the world the Pentecostal or are they trying to sing Under the inspiration when you're dancing you're dancing for what it's already spoken and everything got clear amen is my volume okay I learned to check on the volume everybody okay I'm not blasting somebody's here so let's go ahead and bless the devil amen the Book of Esther chapter 2. [Laughter] amen we're trying to preach this something coming up we're trying to preach this something came up so it was like a delay going on so today by God's grace it looks like we will lend into it like I said with pilling another layer of Matthew 25 so I will please ask you to stay alert okay okay this is very difficult but if you don't have this element you'll have trouble putting things in a message and you will see brother Branham one time say something here and one time brother Brian I'm saying something else and you don't know how to put them together then one message church will take this side and God with it and another message church will take this side and go with it and we put people under confusion there is no contradiction in the message the contradiction is in our mind there is no contradiction in the Bible if you see something that looks like it's contradicting itself just know it's something you have not caught it yet if you give a time you stay under prayer the Holy Spirit Will Enlighten you amen so Esther chapter 2 if you dare you can say Amen verse one we went deeply in the Book of Esther stop somewhere but I believe you should have a beautiful good background here the Bible says in verse 1 after these things when the Wrath of the King ahazarus was appeased he remembered vastra and what she has done and what was decreed against her you might be seated you need to keep your Bible today and say the king's servant that ministered to him let there be fair young virgins sought for the king so not any woman could be bring that could be brought there she has to be a virgin and Matthew 25 is dealing with the virgin everybody okay praise God he says and let the king appoint verse 3 let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom that they may gather together all the fair young virgins to shushan the Palace to the house of the women to the custody of hege the king's Chamberlain Keeper of the women and let their things for purification be given them so the first qualification they had to be virgin but if you look even though they are picked they cannot be brought into the presence of the king they have to go through a purification so to be picked is not good enough hi everybody okay everybody okay so if they picked you to be a member of the Bride it doesn't means that you made it foreign [Music] because okay let me keep it everybody okay so number one you gotta be picked amen and we know picked mint water everybody okay it means justification because Brother Brad I'm saying justification if it's a glass of water that has been dropped somewhere when you pick it up they justify you they qualify You by depicting it goes with the calling so you have been called you have been selected everybody okay but regardless of how much you are put in the pool of the virgin you still not sure whether you're gonna make it to the king or not everybody okay praise God now from after the picking up you go through the Chamberlain everybody okay in the Chamberlain you go in there for the purification amen glory to God you're going to the purification purification means water are we okay sanctification amen being picked called selected doesn't qualify you being sanctify still doesn't qualify you but you on the right Channel but it doesn't mean you're gonna make it everybody okay everybody okay let me help you with this sanctification job to verse uh job to verse 12 then I will call back again if you dare you can say Amen now when every maid's turn was come to go into the king ahazarus after that she had been 12 months according to the manner of the women for so were the days of their purification accomplished that is six months with oil of Mary we've already went through this and six months with sweet order and with other things for the purifying of the water so you gotta go through the purifying so you are still you are no longer with your parent you are selected they put you in the king Palace you are going through the sanctification but you have not seen the king yet everybody okay everybody okay so you can't stop there you got to move forward we okay now let's go back to verse four and let the maiden which do water please is who the king is God it is the it is a representation of Christ here amen so the problem is you gotta please the king you can be a virgin you can be selected you can be purified you can go through the purification but if you don't please the king everything is gone everybody okay how do you please the king [Music] if the king if king of hazardous is God is Christ and the bread that is coming is going to be the bread of Christ how do you please God because without water it is impossible to do water so being picked is not enough being justified is not enough there is something in you that the king is looking for when the king will see that thing then you will please him [Applause] everybody okay pleasing by faith because with that Faith the Bible say it is impossible to please God it's in uh Hebrew chapter 11. everybody okay and let the maiden which pleases the king big Queen instead of faster and the thing please the king and he did so everybody okay now job to verse 13. Hallelujah amen after the purification of verse 12 verse 13 say then thus came every Maiden to the king whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women to the water King's house so when the purification is finished amen you gotta carry something with you am I reading a different Bible and whatever you desire they will give it to you for you to go there amen the bottom line is you are picked you are purified then you are carrying something with you and that is what puts you in the presence of the king [Music] amen but still even if you get in the presence it doesn't qualify you [Music] what qualifies you in the presence of the king watch verse 15. and now let's go to 14. in the evening she water went so when do you enter into the king's presence you go in the presence of the king when when did roof God see Boaz in the trashing floor everybody okay let's continue in the evening she went and on the morrow so you going in one day but you're gonna come out in another day everybody okay and on the morrow she returned in the second house of the women to the custody of shaskas we went through this in a hotel the king's Chamberlain which kept the water the concubine means you missed it if you miss you're going to be a concubine so you only have one shot you're gonna make it to be a queen if you miss to be a queen you change you are concubine everybody okay she came into the king how no more except the king delighted in her and even if they Delight in you you're not going to be the queen everybody and that she were called by name everybody okay watch verse 15. now when the turn of Esther the daughter of Abigail the uncle of Mordecai who had taken her for his daughter Rose come to go into the king she require water nothing but what who Chamberlain The Keeper of the women appointed so you have a right to pick whatever you want and put on you and go see the king but Esther didn't require anything Esther say you are The Keeper of the house and The Keeper of the House of the women so you have experienced what the king likes and what the Kings doesn't like so I'm surrendering myself into your hand you tell me how to dress you tell me what to put on me amen and whatever you said everybody okay that's what I put on in other words when Esther is appearing before the king her dress is heavy her shoes is hanging the way she looked completely is hanging everybody okay so Esther reflect the taste of Peggy but hege knows the test of the king [Music] [Applause] so to enter the presence of the king you must have what the king like that's it in other words to make it to the king chamber and be selected you must be willing to connect with the Chamberlain everybody okay if you think the Chamberlain is just there to be guarding you you're gonna miss it amen ask the Chamberlain and if you go by what the Chamberlain says that is what gonna make you accepted into the king praises I'm gonna say it whether it's strong without the Chamberlain without the Chamberlain instructions everybody okay with that the Chamberlain instruction you will miss the king you will fail correct because everybody else that went there fail [Music] praise be to the name of the Lord the Bible say she required nothing but what hege the king's Chamberlain The Keeper of the house appointed in other words advised and Esther obtained favor in the sight of all of them that do water were they just looking at her beauty they were also looking at water the dress code when the head gets saved put this you say no no no no no no I don't see why if I put this I'm gonna be old-fashioned nowadays the women dress like this hey they say no problem you had the free will put what you want to put let's go ahead and go over there and when you go there you're gonna turn into a concubine and be no more call into the presence of the king but if you listen to hege if you care your strong opinion [Applause] if you kill your strong will [Applause] this is what I want I don't see anything wrong about this if you kill that and you surrender your will to the will of the Chamberlain you will please the king everybody okay let's go to Matthew 27. stubbornness is a bad thing stubbornness and stubbornness is linked with a high opinion of yourself and it's usually backed up with intellectualism amen Amen in other words if it doesn't make sense to me I won't do it versus if it's the word of God where they make sense to me or not because it's the word of God I'm Gonna Take It but I don't see what is wrong with it [Music] you're in the deadly walk Matthew 27 if you dare you can say Amen I'm gonna go slowly because this is uh something that need to be loaded pretty good verse 50. if you dare you can say Amen Jesus in verse 50 the Bible says Jesus when he cried again with a loud voice he yielded up the ghost so on the cross we found out that Jesus cried and he cried with a loud voice amen so there is a shout everybody everybody okay praise God verse 51 and behold the veil of the temple was renting too from the top to the bottom and the Earth did quick and the Rocks red everybody okay keep those events and the grave were open and many bodies of descent which slept a rose the way we are interpreting this by a denominational understanding and by our movie that we have watched is as soon as Jesus Christ at the cross oh the veil of the temple Pew and then in the cemetery and then the people begin to come out that's why we get in trouble [Applause] amen very important watch verse 53. and came out of the water How can there be a rose so what happened so were they awake and they were waiting wait when are we waiting do you know why I'm saying all of that because brother Branham says this he says but as usual when one regard a verse hell superficially he comes up with a water superficial officially standing everybody okay so let's peel off The Superficial layer let's get a little bit deeper and see what happened verse 53 say and came out of the Grave those that were uh dead that Rose after his water Resurrection in other word in other word when Jesus Christ screamed at the cross those people were still there so you need to watch what you see on the movie or in the cartoons everybody okay according to the way we read the Bible Jesus screamed they went uh there was wet and then the people came out that's not the way Jesus was the firstborn the water so nobody can come before Jesus Christ [Applause] in other words even though they shout was released and that shout did something in Paradise yet the Fulfillment of the opening of the grave didn't happen until Christ Rose I don't know if it's okay in other words between the shout and the resurrection of the sleeping virgin of the sleeping scent everybody okay everybody okay there is a gap there is a gap there is a space of time everybody okay why is space of time because there is a Ministry I'm going slowly I preach all of this roof to get where I'm getting everybody okay it is not that the shout and the people resurrected and they begin to go no no no no no no no no no no Jesus first must go to hell Jesus must preach to the souls that were in prison [Applause] when he finished that's when he have to beat the devil down then he moved from the devil and go to paradise and pick the scent out so there is a Ministry there are something in between if you don't understand what I'm saying today you're gonna have a hard time in this message everybody okay so there is a gap there is a space of time there is a Ministry everybody okay so whenever a shout come amen there will be a break there is a work to do and this is the problem it's gonna be I'm going by the scriptures so we don't go left and right thinking about any opinion we're going by the scripture let's go to verse 53. and came out of the Grave after water his so after the resurrection of Jesus Christ that's when the Sleepy sin came out now the day came out and went to the rapture are we okay are you following me so between the resurrection I'm going slowly everybody okay between the resurrection and the rapture [Music] there is again a gap oh Lord spoken word I know what I'm talking about I don't know why I come across a lot of Doctrine in this message but I want you to get what I'm saying and you would never have a trouble in this message everybody okay so let's read it that's fine let's go to verse 53 and they came out of the Grave after his water Resurrection comma and went into the water holy city and appeared water meaning so the people that Rose never just Rose and took off to Heaven no Abraham and Sarah sat and they went into Jerusalem and they begin to appear to people before they go out because after Resurrection there was another Ministry let me help you up it's a different language I understand it do you know that when Jesus Christ resurrected he multiplied fishes again who doesn't know that raise your hand who doesn't know please raise your hand thank you hold it here let's go to the Book of John everybody okay everybody okay John chapter 21. I'm gonna stabilize You by chapter 21st so it makes sense when I'm asking if you don't know don't be shy we are in the family okay don't pretend to know everything just raise your hand and he helped me know that you need it okay okay go to John 20 verse uh verse uh verse 24. are you there but Thomas one of the 12 called the demos was not with them when Jesus came the other disciple therefore said to him we have sinned the Lord but he said to them except I shall see in his hand the print of the nail and put my finger into the print of his nail and trust my hand into his side I will not water in other words what I'm trying to show you here is chapter 20 Jesus already Resurrected and his appearing and disappearing okay okay now let's go to chapter 21. if you dare you can say Amen are you there job 2 verse uh three Lord help me I don't know which direction we're heading now but I'm going to follow the spirit Simon Peter said to them I'll go a fishing this is after the resurrection remember before the resurrection Jesus multiply fishes he borrowed the boat of Peter and after he finished preaching on the boat he went and he multiplied fishes I'm not talking about multiply the bread of fishes Peter told him that a sale all night I didn't find anything but at that word I'm gonna cast out the net and he put that was before he was there now we are after The Resurrection everybody okay [Music] everybody okay they went forth so Peter told the guys you know boys what are we doing nothing he said come on let's go fish everybody okay day white verse three and enter into a ship immediately and that night they caught water nothing after the resurrection verse 4 but when the morning was now come Jesus stood on the show but the disciple knew not that he was hooked because he has Crew He has resurrected now he got to open your eyes for you to see him everybody okay verse uh Our Father then Jesus said to them children if you notice he's calling them children because Judah is no longer there he doesn't call them children when Judah is there because Judah was not his child [Applause] everybody okay everybody good he said children have you any meat they answer him water no so they thought they were answering somebody and he said verse 6 to them help me up a little bit brother uh David cast the net on the right side of the ship the same thing he did before everybody okay and you shall fund nobody thought he was Jesus they thought maybe somebody saying that they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of water fishes so Jesus created fishes after his resurrection verse 7 therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter John it is the Lord now when someone Peter heard that he was the Lord he gird his fishes quote to him for he was water what a brother a brother and did cast himself into the water see so what happened Jesus multiplied bread when he multiplied I mean fishes after the resurrection so when Jesus Christ Rose he didn't just rise and go to heaven Jesus was doing things and matter of fact he also did miracle I don't know if you get me so if we go back to Matthew 27 verse 53 the Bible say and came out of the Grave after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared water meaning so what I'm trying to say is before the Rapture of Jesus Christ and the Old Testament sent between the resurrection and the Rapture itself there was a gap or a space of time amen and Jesus did certain things again amen so coming back to what we read when Jesus shouted now nothing happened but what was needed already came out but even though it came out the Fulfillment of it doesn't come out at the same time he came here everybody okay let's go to Matthew 28. if you dare you can say Amen verse 1 in the end of the Sabbath as he begin to join to down toward the first day of the week can marry Magdalene and the other Mary to see the Sepulcher and behold there was a great earthquake and for the angel of the lord we went through this did what descended descended from heaven and came and rolled back the Stone from the door his countenance was like lightning and his Remnant white as water no so even though the shout was released amen the resurrection of Jesus Christ needed a descending all right of an Angel everybody okay so between the shout of the Cross and the resurrection of the sand there is a period of time and between the resurrection of the center and the Rapture there is also a space of time if you don't get these gaps this space of time you're gonna get in trouble with William Marion Branham let's go to uh Revelation 19 then we can pray so when you see somebody telling you Jesus shouted in the Old Testament said came out no Jesus shouted something happened with the Old Testament sin but nobody could come out they just like but nobody can come out until Jesus Christ be the first one so that in everything the Bible say he must be he must have preeminence everybody okay because he was the first born from the dead and when he come out before he goes up slow down again what happened Abraham David Jobe all of them say hey let us check stuff Jesus said you know what I have Heron to run you go ahead boys I'm gonna come back I have a quote for that everybody okay so there was a time that they have to fulfill certain things amen why are this time important because this ministry are very powerful I don't know if you get me this Gap that you see here are very powerful and there is a reason why those Gap must happen on the next oncoming sermon if I'm about to get where I'm trying to go you will see what happened here and what happened over here everybody okay the Revelation chapter 19 if you dare you can say Amen verse seven let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come so the marriage comes and his wife has made herself how really how did she made herself ready how did Esther was ready amen in other word the bread will not be surprised when Jesus Christ come you would not come out without his shoes [Music] I don't know if you get me you will be fully prepared when he comes you don't miss nothing and to help you not to miss anything God put gaps [Music] he put bricks because he knows somebody's dragging amen and to her was granted that she should be a ray in water clean and white for the final and then is the righteousness of the saint verse 9 and he says to me right blessed are they which are caught you see the word call to the marriage supper of the lamb and he says to me these are the true sayings of who God so to go to the marriage you must be called you must be invited but we found according to the S to Esther invited is not enough amen you must also be chosen you can be invited but you are not chosen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly again father this morning Lord thanking you for your grace for your love for your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father this is as far as I can go and Lord we are surrendering ourselves and the audience where the visible here and invisible unto their hand so that the Holy Spirit can come and unfold your word Lord may you move me completely Assad may you lock every demonic spirit away from this place but father come as the esad teacher and open your word to your children and bless us touch those that needed a touch whether in the body in the spirit or in the soul in the name of Jesus Christ amen glory to God my subject today this morning is the four phases of roof the voice of the archangel and the Trump everybody okay the voice of the Archangel and the Trump we are very very deep in Ruth chapter four which is the last phase of roof which is roof rewarded when roof will be United in the body because in the threshing floor roof was United in Word with Boaz but in roof chapter 4 now Boaz removed the King's Men Redeemer which was the devil the near one until they can both marry together and have a baby by the name of Obed amen into the Tabernacle we have roof into the holiest where roof is resting and we understand by resting it is when roof received the baptism of the Holy Spirit and the baptism of the holy spirit is the translation of the Soul it is the rapture of the Soul it is the transformation of the Soul it is the glorification of the Soul it is the quickening of the soul and it is the resurrection of the Soul so translation quickening transformation all these words are saying about the same thing because you cannot have redemption in the body without having Redemption into the soul and in the soul it is the earnest of your Resurrection you will receive the down payment you remember that and the down payment started in the saw before you receive your body change which take you from Wonder from one dimension into an invisible Dimension when you go to heaven and you see your Maker Now why are we dealing today with the voice of the Archangel and the Trump because we know that we got three things we got the shelter we got the voice of the Archangel and the chomp but today we are only dealing with the voice of the Archangel and the Trump why pastor let's go to first Thessalonians chapter 4. you need your Bible as we're coming now Hallelujah if you dare you can say a man first Thessalonians chapter 4. beginning with verse 13. Hallelujah amen amen always go to bed on top on Saturday because you got service on Sunday turn yourself on off original can be at two o'clock on the cell phone and you're not preaching [Music] and you're sleeping in a church amen first Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13. if you dare you can say Amen listen carefully why but I would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are water asleep that you saw or not even as other which have water so there are people that have hope and there are people that do not have hope and when we sorrow about a loved one it depends on what you got the one who have sorrow the one who Sorrows so much probably they love the person very well but we want to find out do you have hope because hope will help you how you sorrow everybody okay but Paul is saying here that I want you to be to have knowledge I don't want you to be ignorant about the people that died sleeping trust I want you to know something about them what do we need to know about them everybody okay [Applause] watch verse 14 follow me carefully for if we believe that Jesus did water die and water once again in other words if you believe in the resurrection you already know what the resurrection is now amen if we believe that Christ died and rose again this is a even so them also which water sleep in Jesus who is him Jesus let's push the breaking here what is going on according to this passage of the scripture when Jesus will be coming down he doesn't come alone [Applause] is everybody okay is everybody okay is everybody okay in other words when Jesus is coming to pick you Jesus won't be alone Jesus will be a company am I reading a different Bible accompany with who with the people that died in Christ [Applause] is everybody okay let's read it over [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay you see what people are preaching in the message you see you see what kind of Doctrine the people are preaching in the message for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so then plural also with sleep in water Jesus will God bring with water stop how many believe that brother Branham died in Jesus Christ let me see your hand if you believe it stop so if Jesus Christ is coming [Music] you must see brother Prana come on come on I don't know if you're kidding me I don't know if you okay so when Jesus Christ come Jesus doesn't come alone I will get into the dimension and you will see how he works everybody okay Jesus when he's coming he's picking up everybody that died from the time of power all the way to the end [Applause] let me push the brick right there you heard Jesus Christ came Jesus came in little form and brother Branham is still in his tomb you heard that for years right but we know that there is two coming because there's two form of Jesus his first the word amen and then Jesus is water and we know that the flesh is coming which side and the word is coming where [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay but brother but Paul is saying when Jesus Christ is coming in his second coming he will bring with him everybody that slept in him so when Jesus came on Sunset Mountain where are our loved one who passed away because after 63 brother Branham died so where are they sent you see you see you see so the Jesus that come with the scent will be coming which side everybody okay don't worry my friend we'll be okay let's continue number one verse 15. for this we say to you by the word of the Lord in other words we kept it man here that when Christ is coming he is not coming alone he's coming with people he's coming with a company everybody okay relax my friend I know I will challenge some of the teaching that's okay for this we say to you by the word of the Lord that we which are water and water we mean is Paul alive today Paul was saying that the people who's going to be alive and remain unto remain to the water coming of the Lord in other words when Jesus Christ will come some of the said will be awake some of the people will be alive there are certain people that won't die [Music] Jesus will bring those that were dead but he will find us so those that are in him but they are alive [Applause] everybody okay amen those that are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are water and sleep that word brother Branham explained that we shall not hinder but I won't touch the hindrance today let's keep it amen let's continue to flow watch verse 16. if you dare you can say Amen let me ask you before I read verse 16. When Jesus Christ is coming he's coming alone he's coming with who is coming with the scent okay now let's see verse 16. for the Lord with the scent everybody okay everybody okay come on come on come on come on everybody okay Paul says that when Jesus come he's coming with the sin but in verse 16 Paul sleeps [Music] the Lord how without anybody everybody okay so we just seen that Jesus come how many times he come on the west side as the word and on the east side it will be the Corporal physical Jesus Christ and when he come with the physical form he will come with water but Paul said the wizard saw a coming that the Lord will come out himself which coming is that one [Applause] says something and you don't understand you need to humble yourself this message is perfectly in line with the Bible [Applause] that's why brother Branham said what happened on Sunset mountain is a fulfillment of these things here [Music] the Lord when he comes he comes with water over here the Lord come out [Music] everybody okay everybody okay if you mix these two together this is denominational that's why the people are thinking when Jesus Christ is coming with the Peter and with the gems and with everybody he's gonna face shout and then begin to go Pala and you hear them singing which trumpet is sending which trumpet is standing you hear them singing that's why you need to know what you're singing everybody okay so the Lord how [Applause] so we are aware shall come now we go everybody okay the Lord himself shall do water from water Heaven everybody okay now number one with a water let's go slowly come on verse 2 with water voice of the Archangel the voice of the archangel the voice of the archangel Hallelujah amen the force of the Archangel Karma and with water the Trump of God with the Trump of God I want you to stay with your bubble with the Trump of God everybody okay everybody okay so as the Lord is descending how many elements do we have [Music] the shout the voice of the carcager and the water and the dead in Christ first stop so before the death in Christ last first what should happen can you preach with me what should happen I told you it's a difficult subject what should happen there and then and then if those three things don't happen nobody will come up of the grave then the resurrection remember what we just went through everybody okay have your Bible okay I don't want you to say brother Stephen say everybody okay what is the shout you know what it is what is the voice of the archangel you know what it is what is the trumpet of God you know what it is but let me refresh it to you brother Branham say the third thing is the water which always is at the Feast of water it is calling the people to water why supper the water with the water why where in the sky do you believe that Jesus came down on Saturday are you in the sky let me can you answer me are you in the sky if I take you I put you here you're going to fall down right there when I take my hand off of you what did we preach they shot the Trump brother me say what it is the bread supper everybody okay they brought supper or the lamp supper that happened where in the sky and it's calling into a fist because we got married remember now we go into our reception in our reception please amen everybody okay everybody okay everybody good brother Branham says the first thing that come forth is water his message doing water calling the bride together so the shout is water is a message doing water calling Hallelujah brother Branham say the next thing is the water resurrection of the water sleeping by the one that died back in other ages they are cut out together and then the trumpet the Fists in the heaven in the sky so the voice of the Archangel brings water the resurrection of the water everybody okay everybody okay so when Jesus Christ is descending which form is he coming with he's coming as the word amen and when he's coming ask the word amen the Bible say it goes with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the water but the voice of the Archangel will resurrect the dead in the other edges but we know that the dead are brought when Jesus is coming where everybody okay everybody okay William Marion Branham let me see what I got here amen God with me to First Corinthians chapter 15. Hallelujah let's go to First Corinthians chapter 15. Hallelujah we'll be okay my friend First Corinthians chapter 15. if you dare you can say Amen verse 51 please when Jesus is coming he's doing three things they shout the voice of the Archangel which resurrect the dead and the water and the Trump of God everybody got their Bible let's open the Bible verse 51 if you dare you can say Amen behold I'll show you a water mystery we shall not all walk Us in other words not everybody will die everybody okay but we shall all be out changed dying is not a guarantee to everybody but changing it's a guarantee to everybody so make you aware that you die or whether you stay alive the main thing is you gotta be changing if you stay alive and you not change you doom if you die and you don't change you do so there are people that will die and be changed and there are people that won't die and will be changed because when Jesus Christ is coming Paul say some of the people will be alive and remain everybody go there let's go to verse 52 now Paul just say that we shall not all sleep but we shall be have if you notice after change do you have a Karma or a period what should kill you what do you have a period or a comma it means that whatever started is water everybody okay watch it now now but we shall be all how change in the water so he's continuing the idea in a momentum in the water twinkling of an eye at the last water sure do you see Paul speaking about the shout here do you see the voice of the Archangel here Paul is talking about what according to Paul in First Corinthians 15 the Trump of God follow me carefully is what will bring the change I'm just reading index I told you it's a difficulty Paul say we shall all be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last water so the last job will bring a change in the moment and in the tweaking of an eye are we together are we together the last Trump according to First Corinthians he brings water he brings a change Amen in a moment in a twinkling of an eye amen fine let's continue you there verse 52 in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last water sure the last Trump watch now for the water trumpet not the Trump everybody okay for the water trumpet there is a difference between a trumpet and the Trump everybody okay a trumpet is an estimate and the Trump is the sound of the trumpet [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay now let's go he said for the trumpet the Trump brings the change but for the trumpet shall be water sound but I thought there was already a I mean a sound of the Trump over there that already changed the people why is the trumpet sounding again now according to First Corinthians 15 what is rising the Dead insurance brother Branham say what is rushing the Dead according to First Corinthians 15 the trumpet everybody okay and bring the resurrection of descent everybody okay bring the resurrection of the sand and there will be less Incorruptible and we shall be housed ah so Paul is saying even though we will change we don't change like that first the people must be raising again from the dead then after the rise from the dead that's when we change everybody okay everybody okay I just read it in the scripture let me read it over Paul said and the dead shall raise Incorruptible and we shall be held so the changing happen after the resurrection but the one who caused the change is the Trump but the one who calls the resurrection is the trumpet so in other words in second in first uh uh First Corinthians we have the trumpet and we got the Trump everybody okay the Trump is matching the Trump of first Thessalonians in according to first Thessalonians 4 the resurrection is done by the voice of the Archangel but according to First Corinthians the resurrection is done by the trumpet so which one was the Dead the voice of the trumpet let's go to revelation 1. everybody okay everybody okay [Applause] it's Mother's Day this is meat body everybody okay everybody there if you dare you can say Amen Revelation 1 verse 10 follow me carefully I was in the water spirit on the Lord's water and I heard behind me a water grave voice stop what did John Hurt a water hey how is that voice great of great voice okay John heard the voice let me put it here can I write it here a voice amen we know according to sylvesteronians what raises the dead it's the water The Voice everybody okay let's read it now and I was in the spirit in the Lord's day and I heard behind me a water great voice amen [Music] everybody okay everybody okay let's see job to verse 12. you there you there and I turn to see the water voice can you see a voice I'm asking you a question can you see a voice so the voice is who it is a person and the trumpet is who everybody okay if it's written different in your Bible you raise your hand so no hand raise it everybody okay so the trumpet is the what is a voice what I'm trying to bring here is First Corinthian does not contradict first Thessalonians Paul just use a different terminology but Paul is saying the same thing The Trumpet of the voice is what rides the dead it is also called the voice of the Archangel everybody okay everybody good let's go to revelation 4. if you dare you can say Amen Revelation 4 verse 1. after this I look and behold a door was open where in and the first word of voice which I heard was as he wear and water trumpets everybody okay everybody okay so when you hear it trumpet it is a voice everybody okay what is that trumpet doing watch as a trumpet talking with me which said what come up hither I will show you things which must be water and immediately I was water in the spirit stop so there is a power in this voice Everybody follow me John was down on the Earth in the island of Passmore everybody okay amen and when John looked the heaven opened and a door open and a voice came as a trumpet but when John received that voice do you follow me that voice had the power to take John from the Earth immediately and pull him and put him in heaven everybody okay let's go back now according to first Thessalonians chapter 4 we have the shout which is the message calling the brand we have the voice of the Archangel which is bringing the resurrection of the Dead we have the Trump of God which is the bread supper in the water according to First Corinthians we got the trumpet which is the force that raises the dead and we got the Trump that causes the translation to make you light so you can begin to go up everybody okay everybody okay William Marion brother brother I'm saying the same voice that someone John do what come up the trumpet the same voice that said to John Howe come up it's the same voice that shall summoned the church someday summon the church water amen also the same voice that someone jumped to do what is the same voice that someone who out of the water what happened to Lazarus after the grave the resurrection everybody okay everybody okay you see where brother Branham comes from amen and that same voice of the water now brother Brandon Begin to put this thing here and connected with this one telling you that the voice of the Archangel is nothing different than the trumpet everybody okay brother Branham say Christ because the voice is a person because John said I turned to see The Voice because in the Book of Genesis the Bible said the voice of God was walking in the garden do you remember Genesis okay Christ is the water voice of the Archangel the force of the water that trumpet voice of Christ summon John to the water the same voice someone who in other words the force that bring the resurrection is the voice that also pick you up everybody okay did you not he said the grave of Lazarus he spoke with a water loud voice when Jesus was at the cross he did water not just say Lazarus come forth but Lazarus come for of indeed water he summoned him from the water if you notice he called Lazarus by his name [Music] everybody okay he have to be very specific about who he's calling why William Marion Branham Oh Brother May the Holy Spirit get in our hearts this morning give us the Waters of the heartbeat of the water Holy Ghost and his water power only that that heartbeat will be able to do what survive that sound of water trumpets of God and our heart prepare for this water to know what water to do Paul say if a trumpet give a water we don't know what to do we need to know whether it's War whether it's telling us exit of the building you must have the heartbeat of the spirit you must have the earnest of the Resurrection because a voice will send the signal everybody okay and you must know what to do with the sound you're hearing listen to this we reach our water alive and remain shall not prevent or heal the doors that are water I sleep so the water all those soldiers laying here on the house across through the water but when the trumpet son don't they be dead in water sleep it shall not hinder for the trumpets those unprepared don't know their sound when the sound of the coming of the Lord water bless is sex water heaven and what the hell when he does water but those who are in hell don't know who those who are water no don't know their water they don't know what to do in other words when the sound of the trumpet is released is Shake everywhere even hell will hear it but it's only coded everybody okay it is not a general sound if it's a generous hand everybody will be awakened it is only to the Bride of Jesus Christ those that are sleeping in Jesus Christ they know what to do with that sound those in hell will hear it but they won't move because they have to wait for another sound of the general resurrection that will raise them up that's why the Bible said those that were in the grave heard the sound of the son of man it is no more the bread the bread have a specific sound like Lazarus but your name that God calls you is not the name we carry here everybody okay when you are buried in your husband you pick up your husband name so when Jesus Christ is coming he doesn't have to sit and come one two three four five six seven no when we are baptized we are baptized in the name we pray in that name we bless our food in that name when you are in the name if Jesus call one name everybody that is connected to the name will rise up together because you slept in class how do you enter in Christ by one Spirit are we well into water so when they call Jesus whoever have Jesus in the heart whether you are alive or whether you are working something will ring the bell in you and say that oh the Lord is coming the Lord is coming the Lord is coming to pick me up how do you know something in me just told me that God is coming [Applause] glory to God brother Adam say that same voice that sound when the day did Christ did what wise for the trumpet the water what is a trumpet the voice of who Christ everybody clear now the same one that sounded and summoned him up he heard the voice like water and said the water come up hither see how the resurrection will be it will be how a moment in a twinkling of an eye that clear sounding voice and he shall do water summon the church calling and doing water that great summoning voice God help me to water hear it that day how do you hear it brother Branham say the heartbeat of the Holy Spirit must be in other words a modem must be put in you so when they send the signal from Heaven you have a decoder that can receive and then unfold completely everybody okay we have established three things according to the Cross we have the shout we have the resurrection of descent and we have the Rapture in between them we found out that we got what gaps now according to first Thessalonians we got the shout we got the voice we got the trumpet of God and Paul confirmed the same in First Corinthians by calling the voice of the Archangel the trumpet and the Trump is still keep the same terminology everybody okay now we know we got three elements what is the sequence of those elements I'm good in time everybody okay what is the sequence William William saying no matter he fall asleep in the water first watch second or water fourth or water six or water wherever he fall asleep what shall happen The Trumpet Of God shall do us sound the water last Trump will do what the blast for the same time that the last water Angel is giving his water message and the last water see is how open I told you I know what I'm talking about everybody okay if this is the way brother Branham spoke here so we should see the dead in Christ but they are not there yet brother Branham himself died we see our loved one continue to die everybody okay the last job will do whatever and the Redeemer come forth to take his redeemed possession his church or water blood wash listen to this praying that God will so richly uh richly bless each of you that his grace and mercy will be with you through the coming week and if anything should happen that one of you may sleep Beyond the Veil now remember just remember that it's only a water few hours of sleep and rest until remember that day which are water alive and we men shall not hinder those which are waters for the Trump of God the last water the sixth one has just sounded this is 64 that was 63 and that last trumpet like the water will be the water coming of the Lord is your son and the dead in pressure the water we are just doing water until that time did it happen or did it happen it's in the future everybody okay where are you going brother Stephen this is where we're going brother Branham said the world Rapture in the Bible is not even used at all you can verify that there is no word rupture in the Bible amen we just put that word there the Bible say what kind of being water we read here in second Thessalonians first Thessalonians it is the water of this great Rapture that would take place in the last days now I want you to notice a great thing taking place here now don't miss this sit now notice the word say here in second Thessalonians that there is how many things three things notice from the 30th to the 16th verse we went through that there is three things that has to water happen before the Lord how himself the water appears brother Branham say before Jesus appeared amen how many things do we have to see but these three things are done by who so Jesus first must fulfill these three things before he appeared to us amen and according to brother Branham brother Branham said these three things happen on the same time but if it happened on the same time at the opening of the seals why are they dead no reason yet let's go to first king chapter 19. Oh Glory to God first king chapter 19. if you there you can say Amen the book of first king chapter 19. you follow me carefully Hallelujah what are you driving Pastor you need to know certain keys in the Bible yes if not you're gonna take a cow and put him on top of a tree and confuse the people in the message first king chapter 19 if you dare you can say Amen verse 8. everybody there and heroes Elijah and did it and drink and went in the strength of that meat how many days 40 days 40 days and 49 to Horan Horeb is another name for monsana we went through that the amount of who God and he came there to a water to a cave so ahoreb had the cave everybody okay and Lodge dead and behold the word of the Lord came to him and he said to him what do you hear Elijah and he said I have been very jealous in other words zero for the Lord God of hosts for the children of Israel have forsaken your Covenant throw down your altars and slain your Prophet with the sword and I even I only am left and they seek my life to take it away and he says do what go forth and stand upon the Water if you notice a large Jack when he got to mahoreb first he went and sat under a cave in a cave and God asked him a question what is he doing there and he answered the question and God will not talk to Elijah now in the cave but God told Elijah move from the cave and go stand upon the Mountain so the ministry of Elijah here is moving from a cave Ministry everybody okay into a mountain that he was praying into it under the first pool and the second pool brother Bradham had a cave that he was growing and praying into it but now the ministry is moving from a cave Ministry into a mountain Ministry everybody okay this message is perfectly Lana with the scripture everybody okay what happened when Elijah got into the mountain everybody good Lord help me you there you there verse 11 and he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the Lord and behold the Lord passed by and what happened a great and strong wind did water [Music] everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay in more horrible when Elijah came from the cave Ministry into the mountain Ministry when the Lord is coming toward the larger amen the first thing that come is a whirlwind is coming and wants the mountain everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay from a cave Ministry into a mountain Ministry amen a whirlwind come amen and the world winded water went to the mountain everybody okay what happened when he went to the mountain everybody okay please have your Bible okay verse 11 and behold the Lord passed by and a great and strong wind did water went the mountain when the mountain and broken water this is the rock before water the Lord so they were walked away I mean I mean scattered all of it maybe they had a pyramid ship I don't know I'm just saying maybe everybody okay everybody okay there were Rock there were red because when they bring you this craziness of uh of uh of crazy website to attack the message you need to know how to fight and you need to know where to stand it's like brother Branham was making up stories Ellen are you okay and the great strong wind rent the mountain and broken water The Rock before the Lord but the Lord was not in the wind and after the windward started earthquake Obama Jesus enough quick but the Lord was not in the water earthquake and after the earthquake woke up fire a fire amen that the Lord but the Lord was not in the water fire and after the fire will come up still small voice everybody okay so before the voice of God come we have a whirlwind that went the mountain we have the rock that are renting we got an earthquake we got fire dead the message everybody okay verse 13. and he was so when Elijah heard it that he did what wrap his face in his mentor and went out and stood at the entering in the cave and beyond their coming voice to him and said what do you hear Elijah repeating the same word watch Elijah first repeating the same thing that he spoke in the cave and he said I have been very jealous for the Lord God of host because of the children of Israel because the children of Israel have forsaken your Covenant thrown down your altar and slain the prophet with the sword and I even I only am left and they seek my life to take away everybody okay let's stop there before I go to the next one when God met Elijah the first thing that came was what a whirlwind that is what went the mountain and from there The Rock came up in pieces and it was followed by an earthquake and then a fire then God spoke brother Branham says this in marriage and divorce according to what happened in sunset Mountain brother Branham say and to build record here today of many people sitting here that even saw the sun where in the mountains in the mountain where the angels of the Lord came in the water where we came in the water where the revealing of the seven Mysteries was water unfold the same angel in the same direction on the same Mountain the day that this was how revealed the rapture when you all heard me preach that sermon sir what time is it that morning exactly where he said he will be there stood how many angels seven angels sitting right there from water heaven and as they went up and the water well we're taking them up there we standing watching as they went away science took a picture of it all the way across the nation the nation down into water Mexico so what happened in sunset Mountain had the coming of the Lord in a whirlwind I'm going slowly William Branham brother Branham say that morning when those seven angels came down and did water the Earth flew everywhere is that what happened in horrible seven angels stood there and said return the voice now back to Jeffersonville from where you come from for the seventh seal of the seven mystery will be watered listen to this seven angels just as clear as you are standing here came sweeping down from water Heaven The Rock in the mountain doing water down the hill and the people standing there were water streaming and going on you know and that's flying everywhere and when he was he said Return to your home now will it be its angel will be one of the seventh seal one of the seals of the Seven Seals everybody okay the Whirlwind and The Rock are renting they're rolling down brother Branham continues he says picking up a of an off or a little bald head of my leg like I was there star seven Angel broke through from the sky and shook the place till what what waiting 50 or 60 pounds roll down the hill there stood seven Angel there commissioned me go back to bring this water messages so we found that in sunset Mountain The Rock warrant they were wound came the rock rolled down we need to see the earthquake and the fire everybody okay brother Branham said he told me that I will be a Tucson be early in the morning I'll be picking up a cocoa bear what we call a good header off of my trouser leg there is a mystery to that and seven angel came and did what and the ground did water and everything and rock begin to do water and seven angels stood water the whole earth did watch everybody okay he shook everywhere rock that sasted water that's the flying like that and I look at standing before me stood seven Angel just exactly the way it was I felt like I was standing where way up off the ground hey everybody okay we're going slowly we need to see the fire then we get to the message the other day or about a year ago and told you about that message on what time is it sir and I told you seven angels will meet me out there and be the opening of the water of the seals and there the Life Magazine packed the article of it right there this great water play brother Stephen when I look at that picture there it is a cloud but brother Branham is calling that a flame is a cloud the flame in the Bible my friend when the pillar of fire was leading Israel when he was the daytime the pillar of fire will change into the cloud and when they begin to get dark and night that same clad will turn into a fire so the cloud and the fire are the same thing depending on the time of the day since the Fulfillment of sunset Mountain was during the day that's why the Lord took the form of a cloud but that cloud is a fire by night if the Lord would have come in the night he would have been a circle of Fire foreign everybody clear so what I'm trying to draw here is what happened in horrible is exactly what happened on Sunset Mountain everybody okay everybody okay and we know that in sunset Mountain as the Lord is coming down he's coming himself he's doing how many things which is the shout the voice of the Archangel and the water the problem is the sequence of those things we okay now let's see the message that followed the sons The Rock flu the way we shook the Earth shook with an earthquake what was the message behind everybody okay first king 19 verse 15. lemon I'm gonna wind up let's follow the sequence Lord help me now if you dare you can say Amen verse 15 and the Lord said to him go return on your way God is talking to who he's talking to who Elijah he's commissioning who thank you God is talking to Elijah he's giving Elijah and instruction and a commission brother Branham after all this hand The Voice came and give him instruction go back to Jeffersonville and go preach the seventh here because brother Brown I'm sorry that he won't preach a new message until he goes back in East but he was not brother Brandon because the son of the dollar son the pyramid is on the on the left side and on the right side there is an eagle with a scroll open so he must preach the seals on the east everybody okay everybody okay now let's see the message that follow Elijah brother Branham say that the Bible says this and the Lord said to him go return on your way to the Wilderness of Damascus and when you come do whatever anointed Hazel to be the king of the water Syria the first thing they told Elijah according to God God told him that you Elijah you Elijah not anybody else you Elijah you Elijah you are going to do something for me everybody okay everybody okay the first thing you're going to do in my message that I have for you today after all the sun you must anoint Hazel Amen to be a king we okay what else do you want to say God verse 16 and jehu the son of nimsha shall you are known to be king of the water Israel You're Gonna anoint the king of Syria everybody okay then you will also anoint jihu as the king of Israel everybody okay everybody okay then what else do you have if you notice his message also have three pointers everybody okay first and then you suffer 16 and she who the son of nimsha shall you are known to be king of Israel and Elsa the son of shafat of a bear Hollow shall you are known to be prophet in your water so there is three tasks that Elijah was commissioned not the one he must anoint Hazel to be the king of Syria number two he must anoint jihu to be the king of Israel and number three he must anointed to be the king of what to take the place of Elijah after all the quaking the splitting of the rock the the fire and the earthquake and everything that happened a message came and the message came in three points to Elijah and when the message came in three-point the first point is a larger Master anointed Hazel Elijah must anoint jihu and Elijah must anoint Elisha three anointing has to be released this message was given in one time together as a package everybody okay God didn't speak to Elijah in three days God spoke to Elijah at the same day but he gave him three points anoint this one anoint this one anoint this one and God left door those three points were given in one time in one day but how those dots to repent came to pass question Elijah you know the story went across Jordan and he went there and he left his mantle and Elisha picked up and he picked the double portion so according to what we know Elijah fulfilled this one everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay because Elijah and Elisha were going together Elijah said I need a double portion of your spirit the Cross Jordan he left the mantle and then the anointing Came Upon Elijah so that was fulfilled by who Elijah but God told Elijah he must fulfill one two and three right the problem is do you follow me after Elijah anointed Elisha God took a larger home everybody okay Elijah left but God said it's Elijah who's gonna anoint jihu it's Elijah who will anoint Hazel but Elijah only Anointed The Lasha and went away was the word of God fulfilled yes or no who anointed Hazel who anointed jihu everybody okay when Elijah took his anointing and jumped upon Elisha was she who there was Hazel dead they were they anointed at the same time in other words the instructions come in one time but the Fulfillment have gaps [Applause] [Music] serious ly let's go to second king then I'll Rush quickly to finish let's go to second king chapter eight ah my my amen amen amen okay Shake somebody's hand and say just get prepared amen glory to God second king chapter eight if you dare you can say Amen let's go to verse seven are you there you there and Alaska came to Damascus not Elijah and Ben Haddad the king of Syria was sick and he was told him saying the man of God is come here and the King say to Hazel which was a servant amen remember here's the least they want to become king do you remember right take a present in your hand and go meet the man of God and inquire of the Lord by him saying shall I cover of shall I recover of this disease everybody okay and so as I went to meet him and took a present with him even every good thing of Damascus kill for the camel's burden and came and stood before him and say your son better than king of Syria has sent me to you saying shall I recover of this disease and Elisha said to him go say to him you may certainly recover however the Lord had shown me that he shall surely die for the contradiction hey everybody okay let me leave that alone and he said his countenance steadfastly until he was ashamed and the man of God wept so the king of Syria has a servant by the name of Hazel he took his or he said go the man of God is there go give him present so he can pray for me I want to be healed when the king when the servant went there he gives the present they give him the message and suddenly Elijah begin to look at him and he looked at the Hazel he looks so much and he began to cry everybody okay Hazel data they said why is he crying verse uh verse 12. and heso say why whip my Lord and he answered because I know the evil that you will do to the children of Israel their stronghold will you set on fire and the young man will you say slay with the sword and with and will Dash their children and whip up their women with child and Hazel say but what is your servant a dog that he would do such a great thing in other words me I will stand here as a messenger me doing such big things and ripping and attacking a nation like Israel remember the anointing of Elisha is the anointing of Elijah everybody okay everybody okay and Elisha answered the Lord has shown me that you shall be king of the waters who took the mother of Hazel Elijah or Elisha after Elijah is already gone the remaining of the prophecy is fulfilled with Elisha job to verse 15. and he came to pass on the moral that he took a sickle of Hazel and deep in the water and spread it on his face so he died and Hazel reign in his water so the anointing of Hazel came not by a larger who met but he came with Elisha who followed the message of Elijah the Prophet Elijah only fulfilled one thing but the two other things was not fulfilled by Elijah he was fulfilled by Elijah that received the anointing of a Raja brother Branham saying Elisha is a top of the church [Applause] there is three things that is given to Elijah but Elijah will only fulfill one the remaining of the prophecy will be fulfilled in sequence not with Elijah but we feel Asha what the Lord descended on Saturday he met brother Branham alone [Music] the three things came down but only one have to be handled by William Mayon pranam the other two must be handled by the brother slow down let's go to chapter nine let's go to chapter nine we understood now that Elisha was anointed by Elijah but Hazel was anointed by Elisha not Elijah we need to find out jihu who anointed jihu verse 9. are you there verse one and then last shall the prophet called one of the children of the prophet and said to him gird up your loans and take this box of water in your hand the oil came from who and when you come there look out there for who the son of Jehoshaphat the son of nimshi and going and make him Rise Up from among his Brethren and carry him to an inner chamber then take the box of oil the anointing that is coming from Elisha and pour it on his head and say that says the Lord I have anointed you King Of Who then open the door and flee and tarry who anointed jihu Elisha by the son of the prophet so when we go back to more horrible if you take that prophecy God say Elijah you're going to do three things you will anoint Elisha you will anoint jehu you will anoint Hazel but when God begin to fulfill those things Elijah only does one and the remaining Elisha doesn't touch them it is left to be fulfilled when Elisha is no longer on the scene everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay let me wind up because we have to stop brother brought up say three things happen and Shout a voice and a water has to have happened before Jesus water peace Jesus does water all three of them when he's water descending a shout what is a shout it's not the water going forth first the living bread of life bringing forth water and God has a way of doing things everything happened where are they dead in Christ [Applause] where is Paul where is Peter yeah where is Columbus where is Martin Luther they are still not awake because when something happened there is a sequence that goes with a gap he never changed he's he's an unchanging God in Amos 3 verse 7 he said he will do water nothing on the earth until he first revealed his servant water and just as certain as he promised he shall water do it brother Branham said there are three things amen number one there is a shout and then there is a voice and there is a water and notice that while the problem say what is a shout he explained the water he said he said the shot is there message and when brother Branham speak about the shot being the message he does not explain the voice of the archangel he opened Amos 3. to tell you that that shout is a message and the message is to gather the bread before we move to the voice of the archangel we must first push our break they gotta be a prophet because Jesus said when the son of man will come shall he find Faith how can you bring Jesus if the people don't have faith yet that's why brother Bradham said when the seals are water and the Mystery is how we feel down came water the angel the water oh Christ crushed us water angel setting his foot on the land and upon the sea with a water remember now remember these seven Angel is on water on the time of water the coming of Jesus Christ as a nature because if Jesus Come In the Flesh he's gonna bring death everybody okay why is this Gap important why is the gap important let's close here Matthew 25. and that's it oh God foreign let's close here Matthew 25 I can get deep to this if you dare you can say man you there first one and then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be like an unto ten virgin which took the lamps and went forth to meet the water these were virgin they were selected they also have lamp they had three things but let me leave it because of the time job to verse I have to skip all of this because of the time let me make my point here job to verse uh five because if I open this it's something else it's a different layer first of all what the blood groom Theory they're all slumbered and did what sleep at a midnight there was a cry made below the bridegroom comes meet him but if you notice the blood group never came everybody okay job now job now to verse 10. and while they went to buy they brought them did what came but I thought the bridegroom already was coming so between the coming of the bridegroom that is detected by the messenger and the coming of the bridegroom that will meet the Virgin there is a period of time and that period of time is a period of time that was given as a grace period so that the Virgin can wake up and clean up the lamp and prepare themselves and make sure everything is in order before the bridegroom comes [Applause] everybody okay so the gaps that we are talking here before are between the shout and the resurrection it is a grace period and that grace period is always a trumpet of Jubilee that is blown as a mercy of God to awaken to gather the bride from everywhere in other words God gave you a Grace by putting a Watchman is a messenger there because sometimes you might wait too long I won't touch it because the timing of the bridegroom will change the bride group never came in the time they were waiting I won't touch it today let me leave it alone I won't touch it today I know what it is everybody okay there was a timing that the bridegroom have to come that's why the foolish virgin didn't need the oil they knew that what they have will meet that coming [Music] but the Bible said the blood group Theory in other words Jesus will come more than the correct time he should come I will leave it alone let me leave it alone here everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay so if you see laodicea lingering you need to be careful [Music] you need to be careful I don't know if you're getting what I'm saying let me say yes and then we stop when the Virgin were going to meet the bridegroom Jesus Christ the bridegroom was coming on a specific day in a specific place and on a specific time everybody okay and based on the information that was given the foolish virgin everybody okay didn't see the importance of the second oil everybody okay let me wind up quick because somebody's trying to pull so hard every virgin was now one they were virgin number two they were all chose all called amen and number three they all have lamp and in those lamp there was oil hey everybody okay so there was enough a measure of the holy spirit that was working already and they thought what the heck was a nurse [Applause] tell me yes sir hey everybody okay everybody okay according to the timing of the bridegroom the oil that they have they found out that we don't need an extra if we can get to the people that are saved that's good enough everybody okay so because of the timing they look at the lamp and if you notice do you take the lamp during the day so the Virgin were going at which time evening time because that's when you need the light amen so if you look at the light all of them qualify virgin see all of them qualify called all of them clarify now the less qualification was whether you carry the second oil or not [Applause] [Music] everybody okay everybody okay but according to that time that they have to meet the bridegroom the bridegroom never came in that time man let me now open this up since you wanted to open it everybody okay the bridegroom came at midnight it was no longer the day that they were supposed to meet him he was another day everybody okay everybody okay so Jesus will not come at the day that human being has been given in description [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay whatever they give you in the church ages it's the landmark if you are calibrating that the Lord will link it [Applause] everybody okay he will go a little bit of a timer and the reason for going through the overtime is to make the fish oil run out [Music] so those who despise the second one amen will find out they are missing the bridegroom everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay because if the bridegroom would have come even the Virgin would be lost because all of them were lost but God allowed a gap he give a period of Grace he sent somebody that he put there and tell that person when I'm getting closer I love the bride so that they can get ready because I don't want to find them not being ready so they shout when he comes when the shout is coming the shout doesn't go quickly to the resurrection the shot will open a period of Grace for you to be able to fix yourself to correct your life to make yourself ready before the bridegroom comes and meet you because when the bridegroom comes the bride will make herself who made you ready because God put a Watchman God put an alarming sound there amen because if Jesus would have come and the dead of Saint risen they will find you in a nightclub everybody okay and you will miss the Rapture but the shout is coming the shout is the brother because the shout is the message the message is your mercy seat the message is your blood the messages the giving time that God is giving us today to make sure we correct everything we prepare ourselves before he showed up but remember the whole package is already released if you tell it too long it's gonna pick the voice of the archangel and when you begin Tuesday to see the scent of God begin to rise up just know that you miss it because it's too late so before you see brother Branham one day you need to correct your life let's stop here let's stand the voice of the archangel and the Trump of God you go home and review this slowly I know we have to approach it slowly because of the confusion over the years in the message that's why he preacher in this message preaching that they are in the millennium I heard it they are preaching they are in the millennium and I don't have any problem if they come to me I would take them to the zoo and put them where the lion is and see whether they are in the Millennium or not everybody okay why are we preaching things like this because you never understood the sequence of the scripture the shout came behold the bridegroom cometh yes but where is the bad gum no trim your lamp the midnight shout is streaming left it is a signal fix yourself fix yourself quickly fix yourself quickly because Jesus is coming he will not appear unto you until the three things are done when the last thing is done then you're gonna see your maker but you won't meet him here you're gonna meet him in the sky and the Trump of God will pick you up to pull you up there but between all of these things we got gap between the shot and the resurrection there is a Ministry between the resurrection and the meeting of the Lord in the sky there is also a gap if you put them together you're going to be confused because our loved one are still standing there let's pray this message is not another religion this message is not a cult this message is not about you were born in it and this is the religion that you know from your father your mother this is what you do this is not it if you will have that conception you are missing yourself and you're going to find yourself left here while the remaining of the church is gone this message is an alert this message is a period of Grace yes this message is God in his who is rich in Mercy that I have sent you something a signal to prepare you this message is God who have put hege to make sure he give you all the instruction so that you don't miss the test so that you cannot miss going into the rapture but what we have to do we have to surrender we have too much of ourselves amen for never something that God tells you to do you don't do it it means your opinion is still above the word of God if God shows you something in this church or maybe you're listening to a tape or maybe you're listening to a preacher and God unfold to you that stop doing this this is wrong if you continue to do that it is telling God you are taking your will above his will you know what you're doing that you know you're not supposed to be doing you know what you're doing that you're giving every reason you can give to prove that I cannot do this yet you know it's the things of God amen the time of Mercy is going into overtime amen before you begin to see the dead in Christ Rising please check your life you don't want to stay in this earth because of a skirt you don't want to stay here because of your job you don't want to stay here because of a shoe a high-heeled shoe you don't want to stay here because of your opinion you don't want to stay here because of a makeup or an earringer you don't value your soul you don't want to stay here because you want to please everybody you want to be to every party you want to be to everything and the last thing you have to do is to be in church you are in church when all your agenda are fulfilling there is nothing to do that's when you go to church if there is one thing you drop church you go do it if there is something you drop church you do it if they call you on the cell phone you were reading the Bible you stop the Bible you start going to the phone call for two hours and you won't read the scripture let's humble ourselves when I say pray I don't want you to murmur I want you to talk to him because the Bible said this is the House of Prayer where we come and we talk when I will preach about prayer prayer you must come to church and you must talk to God brother Branham say when we go to church we go to church to talk to him you talk to God you know where you are talk to him a few minutes before we go as they play something Softly thank you Jesus you pray on your own [Music] positions thank you
