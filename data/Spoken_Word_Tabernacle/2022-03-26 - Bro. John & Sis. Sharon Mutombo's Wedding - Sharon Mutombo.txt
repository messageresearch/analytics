is [Music] [Music] yeah the congregation might be stated who give this woman to be wife to this man give her a set from saturn [Music] [Applause] go ahead brother john [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh i would like to read the portion of the scriptures in genesis chapter 2 beginning from verse 20. command [Music] and to every beast of the field yeah today's anniversary but for adam there was not found and help me for him and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept and he took one of his he'll be in the circuit and closed up the flesh instead thereof if you notice the lord never left that door open he and the bible says that and the read which the lord god has taken from men and brought her unto the man so god himself brought his own daughter unto the men remember and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of men pascality pleased the lamb therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh in the message the invisible union brother branham says that marriage is the oldest institution in the world can you say amen he says that it was performed first and instituted in the garden of eden the first is that marriage is very important very very important if you notice the way the holy scripts were placed the first book in the old testament is the book of generals [Music] and it opened up with a series of events in and a succession of events in succession from the world which was void and informed demand and then all the way to the garden of eden and then after god finished that genealogy of the earth which we commonly call evolution and god introduces the first man called adam that was your first adam and if you go to the new testament the first book of the new testament is the book of matthew and we see another genealogy there of the lord jesus christ starting from abraham all the way down and then at the end yeah the genealogy ended with the second adam allegiance he was created male and female so there was one specie that was missing if you go to the book of matthew again in the genealogy of the lord jesus christ the bible says that there were 42 generations but if you can't you will find out that it's only 41 generations and there was another generation that was missing if you notice nobody blessed their marriage so the beginning in the old testament started with marriage hello even the first miracle of the lord jesus christ happened in the day of america i don't have time to go through roof and buzz rebecca and isaac all the way to the book of revelation with the marriage of the lamb and the second point i want to highlight [Music] if we look in genesis chapter one verse 26 when god created man god is male and female masculine feminine god is not homosexual journey homosexuals god is male and female a masculine feminine and we found that those two mates started from eternity [Music] before god initiated their marriage they already were joined together from that when a man loves a woman because i know uh m in the farm and marries her because she's just pretty ella marie pascalis there shall be an end to that you're right but when a man finds a woman that he loves proven from killem he don't know why he nello but he loves her male 1 and she found a man that she loves no matter what he looks like he loves now he loves her she loves him that is an eternal mate in glory [Music] death no nothing else can ever separate them because they are from eternity they step out in the space of time and we from the dust of the uh the earth the bible says that he breathed the breath of life and brother branham said that that breath was god breathing not man brother said that breath was eternal life but what god did you have faith before a young man can get married to a young woman you must settle the question of eternal life and the same applied to the woman as well the resentment that adam has a communion between him and god alone coming your uncle with you and if in eternity have communion between her and her father before anybody can get married you must have a personal relationship or intimacy with your make-up and then put men into that garden and the bible says that god placed men in the garden so that men can take care and dress that in other up god gave him a responsibility before he got married i don't return jeremy donald responsibility no wonder brother branham before he marry a couple he always asks a question whether the man has a job or not because the man must have a responsibility another responsibility in the response and then god initiated the process of evil hello verse 22. whosoever i found the good thing an obtainable favor of the lord [Music] in so much that are regarded that he regarded not the offering anymore the telemaniac in considerably voter fund or receive it with good will at your hand uh there was the woman so god was rebuking israel israel that the altar of the lord were filled with people and because of the people that were crying upon that altar yeah of course they played they just said hotel god refused to listen to the prayer of his people wherefore because the lord has been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth against whom that has dealt treacherously god could not listen to the prayer of israel when they broke the marriage covenant he said [Music] and peter said that your prayers also can be hindered if you don't keep the marriage covenant yes so brother john and sisters [Music] that everything was from the original creation perfect to choose a perfect de la creation original the only species that was created different was a woman farmer she was created as a pro as a byproduct she was created from something that was already created but there is a very key and a mystery that lies with that creation because as long as everything was perfect in the garden of eden god was a redeemer but all those attributes were locked because everything was perfect in the garden of heaven the presence of a woman represents in the presence of a by-product to give god the ability to express his attributes explanations that you read the word the woman unlock the plan of redemption if the woman was created as the original creation because was really an opportunity to god for god to show his strengths because paul said that his strength is made perfect in weakness is that marriage reflect the union between us and jesus christ because god was also male and female basketball uh masculine effeminate in the book of ephesians for it that he must sanctify and cleanse it the short kill the washing of water by the world that he might present to himself a glorious church in atleast glorious not having sparta or any such things but that it should be holy and without blemishes and in the book of revelation chapter 19 verse 7. revelations amen amen blessed be the name of the lord dear beloved appreciate your enemy we are
