[19:31] seal
[19:32] his genealogy the genealogy of
[19:34] melchizedek
[19:36] is not among human beings
[19:38] and the genealogy of jesus christ
[19:41] because melchizedek became jesus christ
[19:43] is not a genealogy among human beings so
[19:47] what do you expect his wife genealogy to
[19:49] be
[19:50] not among human beings
[19:54] amen
[19:55] that's why they hid it
[19:57] and when on on revelation 5 when the
[20:00] seals when the lamb took the book
[20:02] automatically they opened that genealogy
[20:04] they say out of every kindred every
[20:07] tongue every nation and he has made us
[20:10] priest and king
[20:12] and peter say you are the chosen
[20:15] generation royal priesthood king and
[20:20] priest all of them together
[20:22] amen
[20:23] you are special in the eyes of god
[20:27] brother bradham say what gave jesus
[20:29] christ perfect faith is because jesus
[20:32] knew who he was
[20:34] amen
[20:35] so you gotta know who you are
[20:37] amen let this man be
[20:42] that was in who
[20:44] because we and him we are the same seed
[20:48] amen
[20:51] and brother branham say when you see
[20:52] this it will make the devil
[20:55] tremble
[20:56] amen
[20:57] when you see what when you see really
[21:00] who you are then in good time and bad
[21:03] time he's still god
[21:06] amen it doesn't matter what the devil
[21:08] can throw away
[21:10] it's nothing
[21:12] there is much much more to go with this
[21:15] priesthood
[21:17] just a lever is unfolding a lot of stuff
[21:19] like this
[21:21] by the time we get to the curtains of
[21:23] the tabernacle
[21:24] then it's something else
[21:28] amen
[21:29] boy this message is so good and so yummy
[21:33] and if you don't like it
[21:35] keep hanging around
[21:37] you will understand exactly what is in
[21:39] this message
[21:40] a seed shall serve him
[21:43] which is the woman who served the
[21:45] husband
[21:46] and that seed will be counted for a
[21:48] generation that makes it generation from
[21:53] abraham
[21:54] the father of our faith all the way to
[21:56] christ that perfect faith
[21:59] he gave signal with four gentile women
[22:01] one two three four telling you that it's
[22:04] a gentile gentleman tagenta then he hit
[22:06] mary mary shows you the perfect seed
[22:09] which is a multiplication by the spoken
[22:12] word
[22:13] not a pregnancy humanly speaking but by
[22:16] the spoken word that is the true ways
[22:19] that's the spiritual race the spiritual
[22:22] seed faith of abraham
[22:24] amen so you keep staying in prayer and
[22:27] then we're going to dig on that high
[22:29] priest a little bit
[22:30] and see what does the high priest really
[22:33] do
[22:33] beside us knowing him as a high priest
[22:36] what does it mean to us a high priest
[22:39] and you can see that there is nobody
[22:41] that will understand you
[22:43] like the high priest
[22:46] amen
[22:48] nobody
[22:49] amen
[22:50] they saw a short man
[22:52] on the tree and maybe somebody was
[22:55] passing and say what is he doing on the
[22:57] tree
[22:58] and nobody could decode what that man
[23:01] was doing on the tree only the high
[23:03] priest
[23:04] can decode that when he stop when he
[23:07] looked he's not looking at the man on
[23:08] the tree he's looking at something
[23:11] behind the man
[23:14] amen all we know is about that until
[23:16] brother branham comes
[23:18] and brother branham take us into
[23:20] zacchaeus home
[23:23] and brother branham entered in the house
[23:25] of zacchaeus
[23:26] and pulled the name of the wife of
[23:29] zacchaeus
[23:30] it's not even in the scripture
[23:33] he said her name was and so and this is
[23:36] the discussion they have in the morning
[23:38] because a prophet can go far away and
[23:41] get in your house and look and come back
[23:43] and begin to tell us what was going on
[23:46] so brother branham give you the back
[23:47] part of the story that is in between the
[23:50] land that will happen in the morning
[23:52] this is what happened in the house of
[23:53] zacchaeus
[23:55] so it's not just a man sitting on the i
[23:57] mean sitting on the tree it is more than
[24:00] that

[30:57] shall he do see this is perfect for what
[31:00] the lord showed you sunday so you know
[31:02] he's expecting something greater out of
[31:05] this generation is that right much is
[31:07] given much is required is that right
[31:10] hallelujah he said the works that these
[31:13] shall be
[31:14] that you should these shall he do
[31:18] because i go unto my father
[31:20] may the lord add a blessing to the
[31:22] reading of his word you may be seated
[31:25] no we just look in that little thought
[31:26] we got the thought from um
[31:28] the inspiration was um what was the holy
[31:32] ghost given for
[31:34] what was the holy ghost given for just a
[31:36] little simple thought here tonight we
[31:38] want you to you know things have really
[31:40] been pressing on me we can see
[31:42] by the signs by the prophecies time is
[31:45] near
[31:46] and you know we
[31:48] we
[31:49] you want to be sure that you have the
[31:50] goods
[31:52] you know because this is not an hour to
[31:54] be you playing with a devil that he has
[31:57] an organized army and he come to take us
[32:01] out
[32:03] but we know because he come to kill
[32:05] steal and destroy is that right he's the
[32:07] author of confusion but god has told us
[32:10] greater is he that is in thee than he
[32:13] that's in the world
[32:14] he says no weapons formed against us
[32:16] you're prosperous so we're now
[32:19] recognizing that you know the generation
[32:22] i'll tell you that's really special that
[32:24] just opened things up that should take
[32:26] you to a rapturing faith of grace just
[32:29] to re-ready the rapture of up about here
[32:32] god hid that there for years right there
[32:35] you know we've always lining all of them
[32:37] up in that generation is that right well
[32:40] when god showed us that he didn't start
[32:42] with adam who did he start with he
[32:44] started with david and abraham is that
[32:46] right so i tell you those three types
[32:49] with those 14 in there and that 13
[32:52] hidden in there boy i tell you
[32:54] my my my mind we have a total now you
[32:58] know you're of the royal priesthood you
[33:00] know you have roar your blood
[33:02] you notice it's not believing you know
[33:05] it so it should not be no wavering now
[33:08] things we got to be sure that you got
[33:10] that baptism of the holy ghost that
[33:13] right because we're about to get out of
[33:15] here and that's the only thing that's
[33:16] going in the rapture is the message of
[33:19] the hour for your day is that right
[33:22] we're going in so i don't want to
[33:24] by the grace of god
[33:27] let me read this here
[33:34] you know when the holy ghost you know
[33:35] actually
[33:36] you know we're looking at so much and
[33:38] just kill we're actually you're going
[33:40] back but you're going but we're moving
[33:42] forward
[33:43] you know when that labor was opened up
[33:45] you you shrimp was able to see calvary
[33:47] in it is that right
[33:49] it bring you right there all the way to
[33:51] to that blood
[33:52] and you know but we know in calvary that
[33:55] god had came when he defeated the devil
[33:58] there at calvary right
[34:01] all sin was defeated at calvary
[34:04] and so we know that right there when the
[34:06] lord said it is finished it's finished
[34:09] but he also has given us the right down
[34:11] to authority to bind and loose is that
[34:14] right there's no way when the holy ghost
[34:17] come you move forward the joy of the
[34:19] lord is our strength and no matter what
[34:22] satan can throw with you now it cannot
[34:24] bind your thought it cannot take your
[34:27] joy because we are fighting a defeated
[34:30] enemy is that right he's defeated he's
[34:33] the bluff he's a good adversary but as
[34:35] long as we're walking out after the
[34:37] flesh but stay in the spirit is that
[34:39] right and that's why the holy spirit
[34:41] showed us even those that getting thrown
[34:44] off in this message right now he done
[34:46] taught us he said some is looking at the
[34:48] prophet of god as just in the flesh is
[34:51] that right and so if god had told us
[34:54] where we walk in the spirit is that
[34:56] right and then when you walk in the
[34:58] revelation of the word the light of the
[35:01] word uh god will open up and show you
[35:03] war is that right so then he also told
[35:06] us we can walk in the rim of visions is
[35:08] that right so we can move in there so
[35:11] now you know by you being a chosen
[35:14] generation all these things are yours
[35:17] you don't have to worry about it you can
[35:20] look for it is that right we're walking
[35:23] in this hour here by faith now you see
[35:25] why the holy ghost kept anointing the
[35:27] past about walking with boldness i could
[35:30] come to boldness before the throne of
[35:32] god is that right you can go to boldness
[35:35] through the throne of god for your
[35:37] family for your loved ones something
[35:39] that's someone that's suffering you
[35:41] claim him is that right don't give up on
[35:43] anyone you'll find out because the true
[35:46] seed of abraham they fully believe that
[35:49] all things are possible is that right
[35:52] but the prophet of god we're only not
[35:54] saying i heard him say brother branham
[35:56] saying the message not so much as all
[35:58] things are possible but do you believe
[36:01] the words that you say can come to pass
[36:04] if you say to this mountain it shall be
[36:07] moved huh i don't want to get ahead of
[36:10] myself we're talking about all what he
[36:13] did for calvary then he came in he sent
[36:15] what he send us the holy ghost is that
[36:17] right when he send us that holy ghost he
[36:20] come with the lead and guide us into all
[36:23] truth
[36:24] it's the spirit of god it's the what is
[36:27] the melchizedek is that right ah
[36:32] god has given us another anointing in
[36:34] this hour here now he's opening that
[36:36] word up is that right now you got a
[36:39] revelation of who melchizedek really is
[36:42] is that right he had to come the holy
[36:45] spirit told us that jesus christ he had
[36:48] to switch place with jesus christ is
[36:50] that right he had to switch place
[36:52] because he had to come and get in the
[36:54] body he created his flesh he created a
[36:57] sail is that right that seeds sail
[37:00] inside of mary and he had to get in
[37:03] there to do what to perform to finish
[37:05] the work is that right to finish the
[37:08] work he had to fulfill isaiah 9 and 6.
[37:11] is that right he had to come and that
[37:13] seed had to be burned in there and what
[37:16] was he called a child shall be grown a
[37:18] son shall be given he shall be called
[37:21] what the counselor you young children
[37:24] you got the best counselor in the world
[37:26] i you got the holy ghost living inside
[37:29] of you he'll talk to you he'll walk with
[37:32] you he'll sleep with you he'll keep you
[37:36] huh
[37:37] we are not sent to live a defeated life
[37:40] we are more than conquerors you are all
[37:43] retrievers in this generation
[37:48] hallelujah
[37:51] it's true
[37:52] look what we say now we're at what what
[37:54] was the holy ghost sent forth
[37:57] when we're coming in it's out we're here
[37:59] now the holy ghost had a purpose
[38:02] when the holy ghost is there's many
[38:04] things we won't get to all of it tonight
[38:07] i don't want him to say like i did
[38:08] before coming in and said i try to
[38:10] preach a two-hour message in the hour
[38:12] the humble brother saying
[38:15] but all is well he says now
[38:19] he says let's look
[38:20] and see what this holy ghost is sent for
[38:24] and then when you see what this holy
[38:25] ghost is sent for
[38:27] now since god have nailed it i mean open
[38:31] up the words and show you who you really
[38:33] are is that right
[38:35] some have the holy ghost and they don't
[38:38] realize it and some need the holy ghost
[38:41] you see so we are the rig because god's
[38:44] not going to lose not a one said brother
[38:47] kelly we know these things that's okay
[38:49] i'm a preacher anyway because god gave
[38:51] me grace to bring it here tonight
[38:53] because you still have individuals
[38:55] struggling is that right you got people
[38:58] out there struggling and when they're
[38:59] around they're struggling we don't want
[39:01] none of our because god said that he
[39:03] wasn't going to lose neither one of them
[39:05] and it's our hair now so they have to
[39:08] first go back and get a revelation of
[39:11] calvary
[39:12] is that right what the blood has jesus
[39:15] christ has done for you is that right
[39:17] but if you go into acts 10 to tell you
[39:20] it was the blood of god is that right
[39:23] it was god that came down in here he
[39:26] could not send anyone out to you not any
[39:29] other angel god had to come himself is
[39:33] that right he had to come and get his
[39:36] bride when he had to come and get his
[39:38] bride first we were justified he's like
[39:42] what you never did it now you see in
[39:44] your origin why you never did it now you
[39:48] see why brother brahma said you never
[39:50] did it
[39:51] because the revelation of with the blood
[39:53] from the foundation of the world you
[39:56] were in the mind of god you were not
[39:59] part of the other lineage your origin
[40:01] was in the mind of god uh you were the
[40:04] supernatural being that had to come
[40:06] forth and he saved the best for what
[40:09] laodia is that right
[40:12] what was the holy ghost for
[40:14] we had to understand saints you got this
[40:17] you you're battling this battle but you
[40:20] have the victory
[40:21] god doesn't warn us we're going to have
[40:23] to fight for every inch of it and the
[40:25] brother said every inch of it is that
[40:28] right god is doing so much he's getting
[40:31] his music organized okay stay strong
[40:34] brother john that's not about the devil
[40:36] coming at you stay strong brother
[40:38] because god put this together
[40:41] he's the one that started the good work
[40:43] and he's the one that's going to finish
[40:45] it is that right it's not by power it's
[40:48] not by might but it's by the laws is
[40:51] that right says that right huh the
[40:53] spirit of god is coming in he's in this
[40:56] place and he's in you because you
[40:58] brought him with you
[41:00] hallelujah the holy ghost
[41:03] he was sent what he said one he was sent
[41:06] forth one to be with god
[41:09] he wanted us now when he come god and
[41:13] god as he wanted to be with adam he
[41:16] always fellowship with him in the cool
[41:18] of the night is that right so when he
[41:21] cool with fellowship with him in the
[41:22] cool of the night god always wanted what
[41:26] fellowship is that right when he got
[41:28] over there in the sin see when they got
[41:31] in there and they just looked at the
[41:32] natural part of it he said whoa when god
[41:35] looked around he said i had no one to do
[41:38] what tilt the ground is that right but
[41:41] we know the problem of god brother
[41:42] branham told us it was a compound
[41:45] meaning is that right physically tilting
[41:47] it but spiritually he loved what worship
[41:50] is that right i needed someone to
[41:53] worship me that's why he got around he
[41:56] had no one yet but he had to bring a
[41:58] plan of what a redemption it had to be
[42:02] filled we had to move into the adoption
[42:04] part but god always wanted us to be one
[42:07] that's why we're one with him that what
[42:10] jesus prayed in the in the lord's prayer
[42:13] john 17 is that right that was the
[42:17] that was the lord's prayer over in
[42:18] matthew 9 that was your disciples prayer
[42:22] when jesus prayed and that the father
[42:24] that they be one as we are one the one
[42:28] with what one with the word you'll be
[42:30] coming now one back again with the word
[42:34] in the beginning was the word the word
[42:36] was god the word was with god and the
[42:38] word was made flesh is that right you
[42:41] rather hallelujah
[42:43] lord this is a glorious time hallelujah
[42:47] my god my god
[42:49] thank you jesus
[42:51] thank you lord
[42:52] thank you jesus and look and see what he
[42:54] said now he always wanted that one he
[42:57] always wanted that fellowship adam
[43:00] wasn't looking for god he should have
[43:01] been but when he got deceived there i
[43:04] mean when he willfully sinned there in
[43:05] that garden what he should do god came
[43:08] looking for adam is that right because
[43:10] he always wanted that fellowship when we
[43:13] was here in our routy lives and what god
[43:16] had us hidden in in that world is that
[43:18] right he had us in whatever that walked
[43:21] of life that we was in
[43:23] but if god god came looking for his
[43:25] child
[43:26] he came out looking for him he know that
[43:29] you were out there why because he you
[43:31] were in his mind before the foundation
[43:33] of the world saints god wanted us to be
[43:36] one with the word that's why he had to
[43:39] do what restored he said i shall restore
[43:43] what the power worm the cankerworm the
[43:45] caterpillar the locust have eaten up
[43:48] that religious demon he had people bound
[43:51] up with that religious spirit that's a
[43:54] rough demon out there now is that right
[43:56] we're going to walk let us take our time
[43:58] because i want you to see this by the
[44:00] grace of god in this hour here now it's
[44:02] always been it's always been a religious
[44:05] battle is that right
[44:07] then that brother branham said that cain
[44:09] was a believer
[44:10] huh he said cain was a believer
[44:13] he was trying to show us that what and
[44:15] that it was all by election
[44:17] it was by election he chose us before
[44:21] the foundation of the world so you give
[44:23] him praise you give him mind he gets all
[44:26] the glory because god foresaw all this
[44:29] from the beginning up until the end this
[44:31] is all our saints we've been waiting for
[44:34] the opening of the word uh you see what
[44:36] i'm saying he's taking a lot of darts
[44:39] this fellowship is taking a lot of darts
[44:41] the pastor's taking a lot of darts you
[44:44] don't really know what's going on in the
[44:46] spiritual realm that's why he said we
[44:48] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[44:50] against principality and powers and
[44:53] wickedness and rulers in high places but
[44:55] god has given us the victory he said you
[44:58] want to whip him he wanted to be able to
[45:00] withstand the love of the animal he said
[45:02] i said put on the whole arm of god and
[45:06] when you will be able to withstand why
[45:09] all the while all the trickery and what
[45:11] is it now the whole world is only being
[45:14] revealed to his bride
[45:19] anointed by the holy ghost
[45:26] help me lord
[45:27] he said look
[45:29] he said he wanted what he wanted
[45:31] fellowship
[45:32] the holy ghost wanted fellowship
[45:35] he always did had that fellowship he
[45:38] loved to have fellowship with his
[45:40] children that's why when brother branham
[45:42] said he had confidence in job the reason
[45:45] why you have confidence in job is
[45:47] because he had fellowship with joe
[45:49] [Music]
[45:51] see
[45:51] you got fellowship with god you know
[45:55] you know what you're troubling with
[45:57] you know the things that you're
[45:58] troubling witness hour here now he says
[46:00] how can you get to know someone if you
[46:02] don't have fellowship with them is that
[46:04] right we're family is that right we're
[46:07] family we coming out there i'm gonna hit
[46:09] you a little bit is that right huh say
[46:12] you got the holy ghost and the holy
[46:14] ghost lean guide you i thought i heard
[46:16] the pastor say if you if we had some
[46:19] kind of gathering whatever they send to
[46:21] me they send it out to all those are
[46:23] texts is that right
[46:25] i'm getting ready to pinch you now he
[46:27] said you know even if you're not going
[46:29] to come he said do what send a text back
[46:32] and respond to the text is that right
[46:35] because a reservation has to be made if
[46:38] you go into a wedding if you go into
[46:40] some island and you get an invitation
[46:43] you have to send an rsvp is that right
[46:47] because why because they're planning for
[46:49] you to be there they're not if you come
[46:52] there and if you don't you haven't made
[46:54] plans and then you may not be able to
[46:56] have a plate or get something to eat
[46:58] hallelujah anyhow i don't know where
[47:01] that comes from but it's there
[47:07] huh
[47:09] we're a family
[47:10] huh when you come we truly truly love
[47:13] everyone that right god god corrects us
[47:16] is that right
[47:18] hallelujah
[47:19] he come to do what he come to finish the
[47:22] work he come to finish the work of
[47:24] redemption
[47:25] now the holy ghost said he came in here
[47:28] he had to finish that work
[47:30] and to finish that work is through who
[47:32] it's through you and i is that right
[47:34] let's go to john 14. and we'll read a
[47:38] few scriptures
[47:45] hallelujah
[47:53] he said now look he said let not your
[47:56] heart be what
[47:58] did he believe in god
[48:00] he believed also in me is that right huh
[48:03] he said in my father's house or many
[48:05] what manson and if they were not so i
[48:08] would have told you i go to do what the
[48:12] place for you i thought i heard the holy
[48:14] ghost say they're trying to talk about
[48:16] the birth of jesus christ i thought i
[48:17] heard him say a couple sundays ago and
[48:20] that he spoke more of the death than the
[48:21] bearing and resurrection then
[48:23] then the birth is that right huh so we
[48:26] had to understand
[48:28] let me keep going he said look he said
[48:30] i'll go away and prepare a place for you
[48:32] he says if i go and prepare a place for
[48:34] you i would do what come again and
[48:37] receive you unto myself that where i am
[48:40] there you may be with also that's a
[48:43] rapturing scripture that's not the
[48:45] baptist scripture that's our scripture
[48:48] that's why they always holler god is
[48:51] good all the time god is good all the
[48:54] time yeah you bring a correction to ride
[48:56] a correction to them and see how good
[48:58] god's just thrown in they're running
[49:00] pastor out of there huh hallelujah
[49:04] don't let them steal your scripture
[49:06] don't let them steal your scripture
[49:08] that's our scripture god promised he
[49:11] promised he's going away to prepare a
[49:14] place for us is that right but it's
[49:16] going to come again that's why the holy
[49:18] ghost said he had to come and send the
[49:20] resurrection had to come and send the
[49:22] holy ghost he told us the other week
[49:25] that what that's why he didn't call
[49:27] everybody from that grave is that right
[49:29] hallelujah because the chosen generation
[49:33] has got to wait until the end time is
[49:36] that right
[49:37] hallelujah if you bring them up from the
[49:40] other ages
[49:42] help me lord
[49:43] help me lord finish the work their
[49:46] redemption he said now look and whether
[49:49] i go
[49:50] you know and the way you know
[49:52] he says drop down to verse seven
[49:55] he said now look i mean verse
[49:57] he says and whatsoever ye what
[50:01] ask
[50:02] in my name that will i do
[50:05] that the father may be glorified we're
[50:07] at
[50:08] in the son if your mother then objective
[50:10] is to glorify the lord to glorify him
[50:14] whatever you ask
[50:16] in his name
[50:18] you can receive is that right it's your
[50:21] saints you're living below your
[50:24] standards if you believe what you asked
[50:27] do what prepared
[50:29] get prepared
[50:31] is that right then brother brenda
[50:33] preacher message preparation
[50:35] and he was talking about them
[50:37] preparation people can talk about this
[50:40] rapture
[50:41] people know a rapture is coming he
[50:43] talked about the intellectual demon in
[50:45] the end time and they saying these
[50:47] things but we have to understand if you
[50:50] really want to know if they got a
[50:52] revelation
[50:53] of what god is saying they will what
[50:56] prepare
[50:57] is that right we are preparing
[51:00] god is bringing every word that he
[51:03] promised to us is that right he promised
[51:06] the latter rain we're getting it is that
[51:09] right we can't get it without it it has
[51:11] to be the form in the ladder it has to
[51:13] come together the teaching reign has to
[51:16] come is that right it establishes you it
[51:19] puts you in your position that's why he
[51:22] said go ye all the world and do what
[51:24] preach and teach the gospel hallelujah
[51:30] where did jesus come you're going to see
[51:32] why i looked in that scripture when he
[51:35] got over there brother steve you're
[51:36] thinking we don't want to have a prayer
[51:38] line
[51:39] yes we want to have a prayer if that's
[51:41] where god's grace and mercy is but
[51:44] that's not what god is calling for in
[51:47] this hour
[51:52] you have to be careful because the sum
[51:54] in the message knows how to work it
[51:58] listen to what i'm saying they know how
[52:00] to work it
[52:02] that's under the permissive will of god
[52:05] that was for the jews
[52:07] they the one that believed on the laying
[52:09] in hand
[52:11] you gotta ask them show me where they
[52:13] cast out devils
[52:15] but by their what words
[52:18] huh the jews they had to lay hands on
[52:22] not a not a gentile i don't want to get
[52:25] ahead of myself you got to catch what he
[52:26] wanted to do
[52:28] it's the spoken word it's the original
[52:30] seat
[52:31] see they don't want to move them up
[52:32] there the only way you're going to get
[52:34] there you got to be preached up there he
[52:36] sent a five-fold ministry to bring you
[52:38] up there is that right you got to
[52:40] understand who you are you are the sons
[52:43] and daughters of the most high god you
[52:45] come from royal blood uh here now i tell
[52:48] you when george bush was president and
[52:50] his daughters got their self in little
[52:52] jam you know what they said brother
[52:54] steve when the policemen stopped them
[52:56] they looked around and said my daddy is
[52:58] george bush
[53:01] you know what
[53:02] ah
[53:04] devil you trespassing i got the holy
[53:07] ghost
[53:08] my daddy is god i come from the origin
[53:11] of god i'm from the royal blood you can
[53:15] say your name by revelation
[53:21] devil in trouble
[53:23] devil in trouble
[53:25] oh he won't be able to touch this
[53:26] generation huh shout right me shaq and
[53:29] i've been the girl
[53:30] [Laughter]
[53:36] what did he say look at here he says if
[53:39] he ask
[53:41] anything in my name
[53:43] i will do it
[53:44] if you love me
[53:46] keep my commandments
[53:48] see
[53:48] you gotta run in
[53:50] according to the rules of god
[53:53] you'll get what you're supposed to
[53:54] deserve but it's got to be according to
[53:57] god's way when nobody is not going to
[54:00] change it he didn't change it for
[54:02] himself is that right god did not change
[54:05] the word for himself he's not going to
[54:07] change it for you he's not going to
[54:09] change it for me isn't that right but we
[54:12] coming boldly to the throne of god oh
[54:15] saints when you go there that's why when
[54:18] the pastor holy ghost knowing that the
[54:20] pastor brother stephanie said to walk
[54:22] around
[54:23] humble and like that stop acting like
[54:25] your that old religious devil getting on
[54:27] you huh you stand up to that devil
[54:29] sometimes you just you got to stand
[54:31] boldly you understand and one of the
[54:34] things was power and prayer one of the
[54:37] was power and prayer the holy ghost
[54:38] brought when you're down there praying
[54:41] you don't go to their begging you don't
[54:44] go to the god whining you go that way
[54:47] whether you go to him what as a son is
[54:50] that right and a daughter for the most
[54:53] high god
[54:54] what you ask you can't receive you got
[54:56] the word if it's according to the will
[54:59] of god he said they asked they ask a
[55:01] miss is that right they ask a miss
[55:03] because their motive and their
[55:05] projective is not right and they're not
[55:07] believing what they're asking for anyway
[55:09] is that right come on now that's why he
[55:12] asked him have ye received the what the
[55:14] holy ghost since he believed this holy
[55:18] ghost is essential brother branham when
[55:20] he ran that series he said this is some
[55:23] food for the soul
[55:26] he realized that deep down inside some
[55:29] didn't have the holy ghost some
[55:32] need that holy ghost and some have it
[55:34] and don't recognize that they have it so
[55:37] we have to understand every last time we
[55:39] was here we was telling you guys you
[55:42] possess
[55:43] the gates of the enemy after your test
[55:46] after your trial when he got around and
[55:49] then you have to understand that's why
[55:52] when god brought jesus on the scene now
[55:54] his 30 years he had a ministry is that
[55:57] right and he was tested for 30 but those
[56:00] last three years was hard trials and
[56:03] tests is that right so we have to
[56:05] understand that what this holy ghost
[56:08] noun is sent to do after jesus christ
[56:11] had went to calvary
[56:13] and he died there on calvin rose again
[56:16] is that right send back the holy spirit
[56:19] to anoint his word in the end time to
[56:22] finish the redemptive plan of god
[56:26] [Music]
[56:28] he said look what he said
[56:30] hallelujah verse 15
[56:33] if ye love me keep my commandments
[56:35] and i will pray the father and he shall
[56:38] give you another comforter that he may
[56:42] abide with you for what
[56:44] now we're talking about how did he go
[56:46] all he did was pray
[56:48] he said i pray i i heard brother uh to
[56:51] sean in his last
[56:53] wednesday and he was talking about what
[56:55] the holy ghost he was talking about
[56:57] christ and he was talking about prayer
[57:00] remember they was in there praying when
[57:02] peter there he was in jail and when he
[57:05] was there in jail they was there praying
[57:07] all night they just took john's head off
[57:09] is that right and when they got around
[57:11] there so they was after peter um next
[57:14] but the saints was in prayer all night
[57:17] is that right signing and crying but
[57:19] they were going through the throne
[57:21] boldly is that right they didn't have to
[57:24] they they didn't have to back up now you
[57:26] don't have to back up off of any devils
[57:28] one of your weapons that the holy ghost
[57:30] gave you was the power of prayer and
[57:33] when you get around it whatever you bind
[57:36] on earth shall be buying in heaven
[57:38] whatever you loose on earth shall be
[57:40] loose in heaven but we're gonna have to
[57:42] show you but what is greater than that
[57:44] times you won't have to you don't have
[57:46] time near the prayer but he showed you
[57:48] the spoken word can perform in the same
[57:53] worker if you don't have that time to
[57:55] pray we're moving into the spoken word
[57:58] saints
[57:59] bear with me you want to see i mean the
[58:02] word that's what shakes the devil is
[58:04] that right when the devil came at jesus
[58:07] christ there when he was tempted and he
[58:09] was tested and he was trying to get him
[58:11] to use his power his authority for
[58:14] himself but he turned around and then
[58:17] and he said he said to me he says if you
[58:19] be the king of god trust you've turned
[58:22] his breath to stone okay over there
[58:24] matthew 4. he's telling him he said now
[58:26] you let me see you turn these breads to
[58:28] stone
[58:29] jesus said what man should not live by
[58:32] what bread alone but by everyone words
[58:36] that proceedeth out of what
[58:39] ah
[58:40] the mouth the tongue is that right the
[58:43] holy spirit doesn't brought that to you
[58:45] you're moving to another level you're
[58:47] moving into the spoken word
[58:50] but you can't handle the spoken word
[58:52] without the character and without wisdom
[58:55] is that right that's why when you give
[58:58] you got to have the wisdom remember
[58:59] brother branham was in that prayer line
[59:02] and he was there to stay there for i
[59:03] think was an hour and 15 minutes he was
[59:06] praying for a baby
[59:08] and he was praying for that baby and he
[59:10] got around there she pauled and they had
[59:12] zeal but the wisdom of god got
[59:15] got to grow on you that's why you hear
[59:18] the pastor say and that the message
[59:20] isn't in the 40s he's got messages in
[59:22] the 50s he got messages in the 60s he
[59:24] got limited messages
[59:26] they he progressively moved into that
[59:29] ministry in the leadership of the holy
[59:32] ghost is that right so that's why he was
[59:35] saying when questions and answers of
[59:38] what
[59:39] what is the holy ghost on the question
[59:42] and answers i'm trying to slow down for
[59:43] you brother he got over there what he
[59:46] was telling him that his ministry he
[59:49] said first he wasn't he says the uh
[59:52] praying for the sick
[59:54] then he came and he said the discernment
[59:57] is that right he said but what i've
[1:00:00] always been trying to get you to is the
[1:00:03] spoken word
[1:00:04] he said that's what their ministry was
[1:00:06] bringing us to and you are in the age
[1:00:10] that reap all the benefits
[1:00:12] hallelujah
[1:00:14] so that's why it takes wisdom and he was
[1:00:17] saying when he was praying for that baby
[1:00:19] in that hour and 15 minutes but then
[1:00:22] remember he went back to the scriptures
[1:00:25] and started and made an example of the
[1:00:28] prophet that was under the wrong spirit
[1:00:31] when those children called him bald head
[1:00:34] this is the way we're saying wisdom only
[1:00:37] comes from god we come not the wisdom of
[1:00:40] man so he had the gift but he had to
[1:00:43] grow into it and what he was showing and
[1:00:45] remember when he told moses when his
[1:00:48] father-in-law jethro told moses moses
[1:00:52] you need some help you're going to wear
[1:00:54] yourself out and the people too
[1:00:57] so when brother branham spoke that what
[1:00:59] he was referring to actually he made all
[1:01:03] those people wait for an hour and 15
[1:01:06] minutes
[1:01:07] and he said sometimes god is leaving
[1:01:09] things on people
[1:01:11] he said don't be quick to take it what
[1:01:13] he was showing you wisdom only comes
[1:01:15] from god that's where you have to move
[1:01:18] into certain things so that's why we're
[1:01:21] showing you things now god has given us
[1:01:24] what the wisdom of god the mind of god
[1:01:28] all the wisdom that we need is in jesus
[1:01:30] christ
[1:01:34] and then look help us lord
[1:01:37] he said now with that comforter he says
[1:01:40] even the spirit of what truth who in the
[1:01:43] world cannot receive because it seeth
[1:01:45] him not neither knoweth him let me show
[1:01:48] you come to me again before i turn to
[1:01:50] luke god help me 11.
[1:01:54] let me show you where this
[1:01:56] god help me with this spoken word
[1:02:02] hallelujah
[1:02:03] looking for the scripture where
[1:02:05] where he cast out
[1:02:07] uh
[1:02:08] the demons and he came back
[1:02:11] hallelujah
[1:02:13] help me lord
[1:02:14] that was luke 11.
[1:02:19] let me see if i wrote it down lord help
[1:02:21] me
[1:02:22] yeah i want you to see this because
[1:02:24] some field that don't truly
[1:02:27] see where the lord is moving us into
[1:02:30] but remember he says that
[1:02:32] that they had he was clean
[1:02:35] his body was swept clean
[1:02:37] and when he was swept clean
[1:02:39] and then he
[1:02:40] he went about the devil went about the i
[1:02:44] think it was luke nine was it nine
[1:02:49] 11 24
[1:02:51] 11 24. there it is thank you brother
[1:02:54] hallelujah luke 11 24.
[1:02:57] we want you to look at this here and i
[1:03:00] don't have the quote in front of me but
[1:03:02] when i was reading and looking at look
[1:03:04] what brother branham said what happened
[1:03:06] here he said in this scripture here
[1:03:08] that's what sealed it in my heart about
[1:03:11] he wants the spoken word
[1:03:13] he wanted he said here he said when the
[1:03:16] when the unclean spirit is going out of
[1:03:19] the
[1:03:20] is going what
[1:03:22] he do what
[1:03:26] was he cast out
[1:03:29] brother branham said he laughed
[1:03:33] he left because you received the word
[1:03:38] once you receive the word
[1:03:41] and it's mixed with
[1:03:42] faith you see the only way the devil can
[1:03:46] enter back in is doubt
[1:03:50] there's no other way he can come in
[1:03:53] so he didn't go about that's why when
[1:03:55] you hear the pastor saying they're going
[1:03:57] to
[1:03:58] be pentecostal some of you laughed but
[1:04:00] he's trying to move you to another level
[1:04:03] i'll come at y'all in the name of jesus
[1:04:05] christ
[1:04:11] jesus never did that
[1:04:17] you see and so in pentecost
[1:04:19] they think that some they're still doing
[1:04:21] it in this message
[1:04:24] you see where god is moving us to
[1:04:27] look what he said
[1:04:29] he said now
[1:04:30] he never cast them out
[1:04:33] he said when the unclean spirit is going
[1:04:35] out of a man he walketh through dry
[1:04:37] places seeking what rest
[1:04:41] he's looking for rest
[1:04:42] and we're supposed to have the rest
[1:04:44] ah
[1:04:50] because the holy ghost is the power
[1:04:53] that's right brother abel the holy ghost
[1:04:55] is the power the holy ghost is what god
[1:04:57] sent done he leads you to guide you your
[1:05:01] fortress your buckler your protector you
[1:05:04] are sealed grieve not the holy spirit of
[1:05:08] god which is why you are sealed unto the
[1:05:11] day of your redemption
[1:05:15] hallelujah
[1:05:17] i'm going to get through some quotes in
[1:05:18] a minute just bear with me i want you
[1:05:20] look look what he says he says and when
[1:05:22] he coming he finally swept and garnished
[1:05:26] he says then go with he and and take him
[1:05:29] to him seven other spirits
[1:05:32] more wicked than what himself so now
[1:05:36] you're dealing with eight demons
[1:05:40] you can go over to deuteronomy and seven
[1:05:42] and look at and and look at them cain
[1:05:44] tonight paradise hives jebusites
[1:05:47] seven
[1:05:48] demons greater that's right seven
[1:05:51] nations they're spiritual now they're
[1:05:53] demons we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:05:55] blood but against principalities and
[1:05:57] powers and wickedness and rulers in high
[1:05:59] places these are demon forces that's why
[1:06:03] when the pastor came up suddenly when i
[1:06:05] was looking at the service
[1:06:07] he was there saying i can't i hate the
[1:06:09] devil
[1:06:10] i got no use for the devil
[1:06:13] he has right to we got a lot of blood on
[1:06:16] our hands
[1:06:18] and if satan trespasses i have no
[1:06:21] problem unless the lord i need a word
[1:06:24] you said when the enemy come in like a
[1:06:27] flood you will lift up a mighty standard
[1:06:29] against it huh greater is he indeed than
[1:06:32] he that is in the world no weapons
[1:06:35] formed against me shall prosper is that
[1:06:38] right because god has given us the words
[1:06:41] god in his hour here now what did he
[1:06:44] swore by he swerved by nothing greater
[1:06:47] than himself which is the word of god
[1:06:53] speak the word
[1:06:55] and stand on it he's giving you the
[1:06:57] authority what you buying on earth
[1:07:00] should be buying on heaven who sends you
[1:07:02] remitted see that was one of the
[1:07:05] benefits that god gave you also when you
[1:07:08] receive the holy ghost
[1:07:10] you can grant someone eternal life
[1:07:14] that's a powerful statement there's no
[1:07:16] other age that they have that that's why
[1:07:18] peter and john said in the gates called
[1:07:21] beautiful he said silver and gold have i
[1:07:24] none give it he said look upon me i give
[1:07:27] you such as i have he said what if you
[1:07:30] can have faith in the name of the lord
[1:07:33] jesus christ rise up and give up and
[1:07:36] welcome and they could not touch him is
[1:07:38] that right when peter came when the holy
[1:07:41] ghost came peter had the power what
[1:07:44] speak is that right speech let's go over
[1:07:46] to acts 2 saints
[1:07:48] hallelujah
[1:07:51] we're talking about coming to another
[1:07:53] level
[1:07:55] you know you got to understand it has to
[1:07:57] be a test
[1:07:59] i was telling them there's sunday when
[1:08:01] we got over there and played a little
[1:08:03] football there used at a junior high
[1:08:06] junior high school level and you get
[1:08:08] over there you know when you at a junior
[1:08:10] high school level they got around and so
[1:08:12] then they went to the high school level
[1:08:14] and they got down there on the high
[1:08:16] school level um brother benjamin and
[1:08:18] they got down there you know and the guy
[1:08:20] line right up in front on brother steve
[1:08:22] and they got over there he said boom
[1:08:24] boom and when i got up my head was going
[1:08:26] just going like this like welcome to
[1:08:28] high school buddy now you got to
[1:08:31] understand what god is doing here now
[1:08:34] now you got to realize what that you're
[1:08:37] wrestling against 200 million demons
[1:08:40] that's loose out there right now
[1:08:43] this is not this is no play play but god
[1:08:46] has given us the word to take us to rise
[1:08:49] above is that right because god prepared
[1:08:53] a place for us
[1:08:55] we see you know that you have the holy
[1:08:57] ghost you're getting prepared is that
[1:09:00] right just shows that your preparation
[1:09:02] is there you've been justified you've
[1:09:05] been sanctified you're filling with the
[1:09:07] holy ghost
[1:09:09] now you're moving it to the adoption is
[1:09:11] that right when we move until now the
[1:09:13] adoption god is just training you he's
[1:09:16] seen that you worthy he's getting us
[1:09:19] worthy is that right getting us ready
[1:09:21] for the resurrection getting us ready
[1:09:23] for this this one time show that that's
[1:09:26] going to happen saints
[1:09:28] oh
[1:09:29] boy i'm excited look what he said now we
[1:09:32] know here in acts 2.
[1:09:34] and peter we're going to
[1:09:35] just paraphrase it we're going to read
[1:09:37] not all of it but over in acts 2
[1:09:40] peter being the spokes
[1:09:42] remember when peter was over there in
[1:09:44] the book of luke when jesus to be
[1:09:48] praying for him and jesus told peter
[1:09:50] that he was going to deny him three
[1:09:52] times is that right when he got over
[1:09:54] there peter yet he had the affiliated
[1:09:57] love but he did not have the agape love
[1:10:00] yet
[1:10:00] no one can call him the christ only by
[1:10:03] the holy ghost and that's the affiliated
[1:10:06] love you've got to have that seed down
[1:10:08] inside you being worried by the spirit
[1:10:11] that's why he said put on the whole
[1:10:13] armor of god the letter killeth but the
[1:10:16] spirit gave his life is that right so we
[1:10:19] have to understand now god has done
[1:10:21] bringing us to work
[1:10:22] help us lord he said look now peter knew
[1:10:26] god did not tell them to go in the upper
[1:10:28] room he told him to go there galileo
[1:10:31] wait is that right brother branham said
[1:10:33] what they was afraid he said they was
[1:10:36] afraid because the jews would have
[1:10:37] killed them and i'm telling you you

[1:15:11] a sound
[1:15:13] [Music]
[1:15:18] peter and them knew
[1:15:20] they couldn't come down there without
[1:15:21] the holy ghost
[1:15:22] they knew it they knew his dollar here
[1:15:25] now
[1:15:26] that's what he said the baptism of the
[1:15:28] holy ghost and then he doesn't know why
[1:15:30] he sent it he sent it so we could finish
[1:15:34] fulfilling the plan of redemption the
[1:15:36] work of god says look over here in acts
[1:15:40] chapter 2
[1:15:41] peter crane
[1:15:43] see they all got to be on one mind
[1:15:46] one accord
[1:15:48] we all got to be on one mind
[1:15:50] one accord don't let that spirit come up
[1:15:53] in here the devil tried to take away you
[1:15:56] know your benefits just about every
[1:15:58] place i go
[1:16:00] they it's a famine of hearing the words
[1:16:02] huh
[1:16:04] they can sit there and watch a movie for
[1:16:05] two hours
[1:16:06] they can go around in and we talk about
[1:16:09] a ball game for two hours and and being
[1:16:12] good uh i'm
[1:16:13] caught up in the things in it of that
[1:16:15] world and then but think jesus says
[1:16:18] setting out your treasures on things on
[1:16:21] earth and put your treasure on things
[1:16:23] above above things that are what eternal
[1:16:27] that's what happened to the one when
[1:16:28] jesus was looking at the young rich
[1:16:30] ruler is that right he looked at that
[1:16:32] young rich ruler and jesus knowing
[1:16:35] everything and the young rich ruler
[1:16:37] recognized the character jesus had a
[1:16:40] life
[1:16:40] that he didn't have all he had was what
[1:16:43] was religion he hid behind religion for
[1:16:46] a long time but then the one here we
[1:16:49] come the word be able to discern the
[1:16:52] thoughts and intents of the heart looked
[1:16:54] at him and told him what okay master he
[1:16:57] said good master he said why you call me
[1:17:00] my star he only saw jesus as a teacher
[1:17:03] he did not see jesus as being god in the
[1:17:06] flesh why do you call me master he says
[1:17:09] only one good master that's god and he
[1:17:12] came around there he said what must i do
[1:17:14] to inherit eternal life he said what
[1:17:17] must i do he said sell all your good
[1:17:19] give your riches give it to the poor is
[1:17:21] that right it was another thing he told
[1:17:23] me had to do too right pick up the cross
[1:17:26] and follow me he could not why he said
[1:17:29] where your treasures are that's where
[1:17:31] your heart is he turned around and
[1:17:33] looked at him and said what now when you
[1:17:36] look at yourself you're self-examining
[1:17:38] time is that right his heart was not
[1:17:41] totally sold out to the will of god he
[1:17:44] wanted he was selfish he had a selfish
[1:17:47] spirit that's what i'm trying to drive
[1:17:49] these demon forces out here how many of
[1:17:52] you even pick up the phone and call the
[1:17:54] head deacon and ask them what needs to
[1:17:57] be done around the church or call a
[1:17:59] trustee and ask him what needs to be
[1:18:01] done around the
[1:18:11] thank church lord that wasn't in the
[1:18:13] notes lord thank you
[1:18:17] you see what i'm saying every
[1:18:20] whatever we do
[1:18:21] and word indeed
[1:18:23] do it in the what
[1:18:25] name of the lord
[1:18:26] is that right
[1:18:28] hallelujah the footsteps of the
[1:18:30] righteous he's ordered of the lord
[1:18:34] yeah you gotta you gotta hit him you
[1:18:35] gotta get out the way and let him have
[1:18:37] his way he ambushed somebody he ambushed
[1:18:40] somebody
[1:18:41] i'ma tell you tell you about tell you
[1:18:43] tell your boss you ain't coming to work
[1:18:48] don't call in
[1:18:50] on your job
[1:18:53] even if you're staying home
[1:18:57] oh he ain't pushing you now ain't he
[1:18:59] yeah i'm not going to stop have you wait
[1:19:01] lord
[1:19:02] you see see one thing i learned a long
[1:19:04] time ago see when i go into jails in the
[1:19:07] prisons then i i preach a little harder
[1:19:09] than this and if they even put a dagger
[1:19:11] or something in me by now and i say
[1:19:13] thank you jesus you know what i'm doing
[1:19:15] why because one thing they recognize
[1:19:18] sitting in there they recognize two
[1:19:20] things they recognize the devil and they
[1:19:22] recognize if you love them or not
[1:19:25] that's the key you see so when they know
[1:19:28] these things when you come because you
[1:19:30] love them because when you go in there
[1:19:31] is no money there's no popularity
[1:19:34] there's no glory you always dump and
[1:19:36] that's why i thank you humbly when you
[1:19:38] pray for me when you pray for me when
[1:19:40] you're out there god is doing some great
[1:19:42] things we went down there i've been
[1:19:44] going the last three weeks down to the
[1:19:46] jail and it went down in there they got
[1:19:49] a new program they call rest
[1:19:51] re-entry the service support support
[1:19:54] services and then that service down
[1:19:57] there we went down there the first time
[1:19:59] when i went you go and you got a little
[1:20:02] package a care package for the inmates
[1:20:04] and when you go around and you give an
[1:20:06] opportunity to talk to them about the
[1:20:08] lord and tell them if they got the lord
[1:20:10] they don't have the lord and then you
[1:20:12] know give them some directions so we
[1:20:15] turned around when the first time we
[1:20:16] went down there you know it was the
[1:20:18] chaplain
[1:20:19] got down then was talking with her and
[1:20:22] talking there with the chaplain in real
[1:20:24] life started pouring her heart out and
[1:20:27] and she testified
[1:20:30] said i believe your first day here god
[1:20:32] sent you for me
[1:20:34] i'm telling you the lord is good the
[1:20:37] footsteps of the righteousness is
[1:20:39] ordered on the lord and before we left
[1:20:42] it brother steve she said pray for me
[1:20:45] now that's what i'm telling you what god
[1:20:47] is doing he's doing some great things
[1:20:49] wherever that seed is we're not going to
[1:20:52] lose not a one you got to realize what
[1:20:55] god sent this holy ghost for that's why
[1:20:58] he's sending his love when we're telling
[1:21:00] you about this this is a faith that's
[1:21:03] working by love is that right so we have
[1:21:06] to continue to move forward don't let
[1:21:09] the enemy rush try to rush the pastor up
[1:21:12] here in the blue pit he's trying to cut
[1:21:15] you on your blessings
[1:21:17] share it with me you got to realize this
[1:21:20] take your notes and take your notes do i
[1:21:22] catch everything that comes from
[1:21:24] everything no
[1:21:25] i got to go back home and do a little
[1:21:27] digging myself is that right he
[1:21:30] understands that but god is extending it
[1:21:33] giving him grace
[1:21:34] it's not this is not just being a
[1:21:36] blessing just here
[1:21:38] he's going far and wide trust me saints
[1:21:42] when we get on the other side you're
[1:21:44] going to recognize you have front row
[1:21:47] seats so what god is doing hallelujah
[1:21:56] peter
[1:21:57] look what he said
[1:21:58] now we're talking about the power of
[1:22:00] speech when the holy ghost come when the
[1:22:03] holy ghost come and give you power of
[1:22:05] speech that brother's saying look at
[1:22:08] verse 14 when they come in there look
[1:22:11] what pete how peter responded acts 2 14
[1:22:14] but peter standing up with the eleven
[1:22:17] lifted up his voice and said unto them
[1:22:19] ye men of judea and all ye that dwell
[1:22:22] like jerusalem be this known unto you
[1:22:26] and hear and hearken to my what
[1:22:31] he knew where he was then
[1:22:33] ah
[1:22:34] he came down out of that upper room he
[1:22:36] knew what he was who he was then he knew
[1:22:39] why he was here he knew where he come
[1:22:41] from he knew where he was going huh he
[1:22:44] knew it saints he was that spokesman for
[1:22:47] the group that boldness with him peter
[1:22:50] ignorant
[1:22:51] couldn't even read or write his name but
[1:22:54] they recognized he had been with jesus
[1:22:57] hallelujah
[1:22:59] he had been anointed by the holy ghost
[1:23:01] and he had been called by god he had
[1:23:03] been anointed by god have been appointed
[1:23:06] by god doing the work of god by the
[1:23:09] spoken word for his day
[1:23:15] did not cast that devil out
[1:23:17] that devil was not cast out that's why
[1:23:20] the pastor holy ghost kept having the
[1:23:21] pastor say that
[1:23:23] making people think then they're falling
[1:23:25] on out falling out there on the ground
[1:23:28] and still walking around in there just
[1:23:30] like they did when they sacrificed when
[1:23:32] when they sacrificed in the in the old
[1:23:34] testament it was to cover their blood
[1:23:37] you know i mean cover their sins for for
[1:23:39] a year it's like they're making the
[1:23:41] people think they got the holy ghost
[1:23:43] because they can stay speaking in
[1:23:44] tongues this holy ghost you know just no
[1:23:46] speaking in tongues that's the least of
[1:23:48] the gifts it's a manifestation of of the
[1:23:51] holy ghost when this holy ghost is
[1:23:53] powerful this holy ghost is able to save
[1:23:56] your soul stop your lying stop your
[1:23:59] drugging stop your drinking stop your
[1:24:01] smoking stop your gambling stop your
[1:24:04] fooling around stop your stealing stop
[1:24:07] your disobedience this is power in the
[1:24:10] name of jesus christ the devil trembles
[1:24:12] when you hear that name
[1:24:20] we back down off of no devil
[1:24:22] no devil saints
[1:24:23] huh we come to set the captive free
[1:24:27] what do you say brother robert the
[1:24:29] spirit of the lord is upon me he has
[1:24:32] anointed me to preach the gospel open
[1:24:35] the eyes of the blind cast out devils
[1:24:38] heal the sick raise the dead deliver
[1:24:40] them from cancer deliver them from
[1:24:42] leprosy deliver him in the name of the
[1:24:45] lord
[1:24:46] rise up give him his glory
[1:24:53] i just satan
[1:24:55] we chose to stick with the despised few
[1:24:58] as moses he chose not for the riches of
[1:25:01] egypt
[1:25:02] huh but he's chosen to stick with the
[1:25:04] children of god you want to take
[1:25:06] reproach she's saying she got to realize
[1:25:08] this one thing the lord showed brother
[1:25:10] steve a long time ago the name of jesus
[1:25:13] walking with jesus is not popular
[1:25:18] jesus was not popular
[1:25:21] huh he came in there tearing down the
[1:25:23] kingdom of satan
[1:25:25] it's no glory
[1:25:26] that's why when brother branham said
[1:25:28] what he said young man you get out there
[1:25:31] you need to take your wife with you
[1:25:33] huh
[1:25:34] need to keep you is that right don't be

[1:26:12] a blind man know a righteous man
[1:26:16] faith come by what

[1:26:32] the holy ghost
[1:26:36] even if i don't understand it i believe
[1:26:38] it
[1:26:41] the holy ghost because what he preaches
[1:26:44] he backs it with the scriptures
[1:26:47] he says nothing is god saying that
[1:26:54] when they tried to lift jesus up did not
[1:26:56] he run

[1:27:06] speak he told me to speak it and i don't
[1:27:08] speak it
[1:27:09] because it come to set somebody free
[1:27:13] that's what he come to do
[1:27:16] you see because the gift is there i was
[1:27:18] telling a young fellow he got over there

[1:28:05] gift the gift was put in him before the
[1:28:08] foundation of the world

[1:29:20] us what
[1:29:21] and what
[1:29:23] and what
[1:29:25] and what redemption that according as it
[1:29:28] is written he that glorified let him
[1:29:31] glory in the what
[1:29:33] he says and i brethren when i came to
[1:29:36] you came not with excellence of what
[1:29:39] speech or what wisdom declaring unto you
[1:29:42] the testimony of who
[1:29:44] of god for i determine not to know
[1:29:47] anything among you say what jesus christ
[1:29:51] and him crucified he said and i was with
[1:29:54] you in the weakness and in fear and in
[1:29:57] much trembling and my speech and my
[1:29:59] preaching was not with what
[1:30:02] see i don't come here to play with the
[1:30:04] devil
[1:30:05] i got no use for the devil you come here
[1:30:08] for the word of god
[1:30:10] the holy ghost corrects us all
[1:30:13] that's why you hear the pastor say he's
[1:30:15] the boss he's being honest
[1:30:18] he's an honest man you have to try him
[1:30:21] see you got to recognize why you're here
[1:30:24] you've been called for the glory of god
[1:30:28] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:30:31] he's teaching you this is a what this is
[1:30:34] a
[1:30:34] individual walk
[1:30:38] and by this being an individual walk we
[1:30:42] respect that office that's why you tell
[1:30:44] us they talk about trump i said no bro
[1:30:46] don't do that i said i i said don't do
[1:30:49] that because god taught us to respect
[1:30:51] that office
[1:30:52] you just make that office you know why
[1:30:55] i could be right here president of the
[1:30:56] united states four years i'm going
[1:30:59] benjamin could come here he's the
[1:31:01] president of the united states he could
[1:31:03] be going but what is it called see us
[1:31:05] because of authority comes with that
[1:31:09] office in that position is that right
[1:31:12] so we really have to you have to use
[1:31:15] wisdom so you're respecting that office
[1:31:18] that god has put in here to move you
[1:31:21] into perfection
[1:31:23] he said i sent you an apostle a prophet
[1:31:27] pastor teacher and evangelist for the
[1:31:30] perfecting of the saints for the
[1:31:32] maturing of the saints for the working
[1:31:34] of the ministry to edify the body the
[1:31:38] body the body the body of jesus christ
[1:31:44] it's a war
[1:31:45] and you have to be taught
[1:31:47] to use that weapon the right way
[1:31:49] and now you're really changing when you
[1:31:51] go into the military you go in there as
[1:31:53] a civilian
[1:31:55] and when you go in there as a civilian
[1:31:57] now they bring you to boot camp they're
[1:32:00] training you he says he told us by when
[1:32:04] i was putting on the whole armor of god
[1:32:06] to do what he said for what what weapon
[1:32:08] the helmet of salvation is that right he
[1:32:12] didn't teach the corinthians those
[1:32:14] things in episodes he told him what the
[1:32:17] weapons were
[1:32:19] you are getting what you're getting
[1:32:20] through that ministry is because god
[1:32:24] knows you can handle it
[1:32:28] he put you there because he hit him he
[1:32:31] hit him for years
[1:32:36] he was obedient
[1:32:37] he was humble
[1:32:39] he did what he was supposed to do he was
[1:32:41] faithful to his position
[1:32:45] now much more is required through all of
[1:32:48] us let me keep going so i maybe i can
[1:32:50] get to some of some of those quotes i
[1:32:52] know i've been quoting but i want to
[1:32:53] read a few of them he said but look he
[1:32:55] said
[1:32:56] in verse 3
[1:32:58] he says
[1:32:59] and i was with you in weakness and fear
[1:33:02] and they're much trembling and my speech
[1:33:05] and my preaching was not with enticing
[1:33:07] words of man's wisdom but in
[1:33:09] demonstration of the what
[1:33:11] and of the what
[1:33:13] that your what
[1:33:15] not should be standing in the what
[1:33:18] but in the what
[1:33:20] ah
[1:33:25] i heard the holy ghost see there's no
[1:33:27] way
[1:33:28] you move and let the holy ghost work
[1:33:32] through you
[1:33:33] what he put in you
[1:33:35] how he you can operate no other way
[1:33:39] you see so that's what we're moving into
[1:33:41] in in this hour
[1:33:43] so when god has called you he's called
[1:33:46] you for a purpose
[1:33:48] let me keep going hallelujah we can go
[1:33:51] back over to uh
[1:33:53] who's the acts he said now peter peter
[1:33:56] stood up there and he said you men of
[1:33:58] judea verse 14 and all you that dwell at
[1:34:00] jerusalem i'm in chapter 2 and verse 14
[1:34:03] the book of acts he said for these are
[1:34:05] not drunken as you supposed to see but
[1:34:07] the third hour of the day but this is is
[1:34:10] that which was spoken by the prophet
[1:34:12] joel
[1:34:14] and it shall come to pass in the what
[1:34:17] last days say of god i will pour out my
[1:34:20] what

[1:34:23] and your sons and daughters shall what
[1:34:26] prophesies and your young men shall see
[1:34:28] visions and the old men shall dream
[1:34:30] dreams he said and all my servants and
[1:34:33] all my handmaids i will pour out in
[1:34:35] those days of my spirit and they shall
[1:34:38] prophesize now look verse 22 he says ye
[1:34:41] men look at peter the boldness now
[1:34:45] he's the men of israel hear these what
[1:34:53] now you see why the devil keeps trying
[1:34:55] to get them the mix the multitude to
[1:34:58] rush your pastor when he's up there
[1:35:00] trying to give you something
[1:35:03] none of us is no match for satan but the
[1:35:05] holy ghost says
[1:35:10] that he send you here anything that come
[1:35:12] to hinder him you're precious
[1:35:16] as i shared with you before i'm not even
[1:35:18] worthy to stand here for god in front of
[1:35:21] god's royal people
[1:35:24] chosen priesthood

[1:35:30] every one of us god came now hid himself

[1:38:58] among you by miracles and signs and god
[1:39:02] by which him in the midst of you
[1:39:05] as ye yourselves also know
[1:39:08] you're witnessing
[1:39:09] god's opening that word
[1:39:12] unfolding that word
[1:39:14] you know no man can't open that word
[1:39:16] like that
[1:39:17] it's only the god
[1:39:19] is in our midst
[1:39:20] what am i saying give god the glory
[1:39:24] give him the praise give him the honor
[1:39:27] he deserves his things the power of the
[1:39:30] holy ghost was come
[1:39:32] it's sin so you can finish this work
[1:39:36] anyone
[1:39:37] that's struggling
[1:39:39] out there in their life
[1:39:40] we know
[1:39:42] that they're really thirsting for god
[1:39:44] and when they're thirsting for god
[1:39:47] and we have to recognize
[1:39:49] that it's not about us
[1:39:51] it's about christ what he's sending us
[1:39:53] here to do
[1:39:55] whatever you're struggling with
[1:39:57] you judge the lord have already took
[1:40:00] care of it
[1:40:01] you see he's already took care of it
[1:40:04] so when they cast so when the word comes
[1:40:07] you received the word
[1:40:09] and now you're receiving what brother
[1:40:11] greg the holy ghost
[1:40:13] now the word comes you are only
[1:40:17] struggling with these things is because
[1:40:20] you won't let the holy ghost take over
[1:40:25] you won't let the holy ghost do it
[1:40:28] so now you're struggling in your mind
[1:40:31] so those things that satan try to bring
[1:40:34] back to you christ already took care of
[1:40:38] it on calvary
[1:40:39] everything is a finished work and so
[1:40:42] that's why when you're obsession you
[1:40:45] stop receiving the wrong thoughts
[1:40:48] what you gotta receive what did god tell
[1:40:51] you to do he said cast down every
[1:40:55] imagination and try to exhort itself
[1:40:58] against the lord
[1:41:00] brothers did i tell you when the holy
[1:41:02] ghost had you say that that was powerful
[1:41:05] it could only be one priest on this high
[1:41:07] priest on the scene at one time is that
[1:41:10] right but what was the battle going to
[1:41:13] be
[1:41:13] the battle was going to be with the
[1:41:15] words there's going to be in the
[1:41:17] scriptures that's going to be on the end
[1:41:19] time but that's why when it came to
[1:41:21] jesus he came to jesus with the
[1:41:23] scriptures so we have to understand now
[1:41:26] you won't let the devil you won't let
[1:41:29] god just as he says just get put it in
[1:41:32] neutral and just let god take care of it
[1:41:36] because satan is going to fight you he's
[1:41:39] going to come at you first it's going to
[1:41:41] come right at your mind
[1:41:43] but we have to realize now put on the
[1:41:46] whole arm of god
[1:41:48] think of your salvation what the lord
[1:41:51] have already did for you on calvary if
[1:41:54] you had the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:41:56] the holy ghost is going to resurrect
[1:41:58] that word that's inside of you
[1:42:01] that's what he's going to resurrect he
[1:42:03] said he would bring every promise unto
[1:42:05] your what to your remember is that right
[1:42:08] then come on forth musicians come on
[1:42:10] musicians when they come around and we
[1:42:13] just want you to say
[1:42:15] we just want you to realize what the
[1:42:17] lord has
[1:42:18] really really done for us that's why
[1:42:21] sister when you sing that song god is
[1:42:23] good
[1:42:24] huh
[1:42:25] when god is good you meditate on that
[1:42:29] song
[1:42:30] don't let it come just a repetition to
[1:42:32] you
[1:42:33] because you let you sing it to the glory
[1:42:36] of god
[1:42:37] anytime to any enemy come in you got to
[1:42:40] have a song there on your heart and then

[1:54:00] i was sitting there and i can see how
[1:54:02] he's touching the colors of the
[1:54:04] tabernacle one by one
[1:54:07] and he doesn't even know that i have
[1:54:08] been studying on those things in the
[1:54:10] tabernacle amen
[1:54:12] i don't know it depends on the boss how
[1:54:14] he's pushing the brakes
[1:54:16] amen but i can see left and right how
[1:54:18] he's touching the the curtains of the
[1:54:21] tabernacle one by one and say my god
[1:54:24] amen
[1:54:26] he even touched on the message on sunday
[1:54:28] already
[1:54:30] amen
[1:54:31] there's nothing out of control
[1:54:34] that's why first you got to know who you
[1:54:36] are
[1:54:37] where you're coming from who where you
[1:54:38] are then things begin to change in your
[1:54:40] life
[1:54:42] that's the mystery brother branham was
[1:54:44] unfolding under that slave
[1:54:46] that was walking with his chest up
[1:54:50] despite the treatment
[1:54:52] he didn't work anything against him
[1:54:56] amen his attitude was up way up when
[1:54:59] somebody looked at him and said why is
[1:55:01] that person different than all of them
[1:55:03] do you treat them different no
[1:55:05] do you do something different no is he
[1:55:06] sleeping in a different place than they
[1:55:08] are there no so what's happened and uh
[1:55:10] and the buyers say i was also wondering
[1:55:13] myself
[1:55:14] until i come to realize that what
[1:55:17] happened is his origin
[1:55:21] amen his origin make him behave a
[1:55:24] different way
[1:55:25] and that origin gave him power
[1:55:28] to ride over the circumstances of
[1:55:32] slavery without really feeling slavery
[1:55:36] he's working as a slave but he doesn't
[1:55:38] feel it
[1:55:42] amen
[1:55:43] you fishing peter
[1:55:46] but your fishing is a leisure
[1:55:49] to get money out of it
[1:55:52] at the beginning he was working working
[1:55:54] working you go home you tired but this
[1:55:56] kind of fishing is sent by the master
[1:55:58] you go fish
[1:56:00] and open the mouth what do you think
[1:56:03] amen
[1:56:04] i work all night there is nothing take
[1:56:07] the net cast it and you pull it what did
[1:56:09] you do
[1:56:11] what did you do
[1:56:13] no work still doing the same thing
[1:56:15] and then they begin to call the other
[1:56:16] die guys come here come here come here
[1:56:19] why
[1:56:20] that is the that just knowing who you
[1:56:23] are
[1:56:24] changed that slave mentality the slave
[1:56:27] was not worrying about his geographic
[1:56:30] spot location
[1:56:32] that was not his problem as long as he
[1:56:35] understood who he was even if he's in a
[1:56:38] strange land
[1:56:40] he still behave like a child of the king
[1:56:44] when everybody is beat down they depress
[1:56:47] they don't know what to do the economy
[1:56:49] is bad the business begin to run low
[1:56:52] everything it seems to be crushing there
[1:56:55] is another strength that is coming up
[1:56:57] when everybody's
[1:56:59] perplexed
[1:57:00] you see somebody standing up and just
[1:57:02] rejoicing whoa
[1:57:04] that that's what you need to be
[1:57:07] until somebody will ask who's that
[1:57:11] why are you always happy
[1:57:13] why are you not scared why are you not
[1:57:15] worrying about everything that is
[1:57:16] happening all over the world
[1:57:19] and then they will find also your story
[1:57:22] and this time it's a different story you
[1:57:25] say beyond the edges of time
[1:57:28] i came from a lineage
[1:57:30] that lineage is an eternal lineage it's
[1:57:33] a lineage of melchizedek i am from that
[1:57:36] lineage and even though i'm still in
[1:57:39] this world
[1:57:40] going through everything i'm going it
[1:57:43] doesn't change who i am
[1:57:45] and because of that it gives me strength
[1:57:48] of what is going on on the world till
[1:57:50] you numb
[1:57:53] do you know what numbing
[1:57:55] have you been there the doctor and they
[1:57:56] give you a shot and you can't feel
[1:57:57] nothing
[1:57:58] amen
[1:57:59] yet they are operating on you but you
[1:58:01] don't feel anything because something
[1:58:03] numb you
[1:58:04] that's the power of knowing who you are
[1:58:08] amen
[1:58:09] that's the power of knowing who you are
[1:58:12] it doesn't that when when you when you
[1:58:14] receive that revelation that slave was
[1:58:17] not rich
[1:58:20] that slave didn't even have a bank
[1:58:22] account
[1:58:23] but just that revelation was enough
[1:58:26] to give him boldness
[1:58:29] you don't need to have money in the bank
[1:58:31] account to become bolden
[1:58:33] that's proud
[1:58:37] that's proud
[1:58:39] because you're looking at the money now
[1:58:40] you're trying to show off at the
[1:58:42] beginning you were humble that's proud
[1:58:44] but whether i have it or not i'm just
[1:58:47] that's a different thing
[1:58:50] that one is a revelation
[1:58:52] a revelation of knowing who you are what
[1:58:56] is your lineage what is your father so
[1:58:59] i'm not caring about who's there whining
[1:59:02] whining whining over there the other
[1:59:04] slaves are winding that was not his
[1:59:06] problem when they gave him five he start
[1:59:09] working
[1:59:11] he finished boss anything else
[1:59:13] no i finished thank you very much and
[1:59:14] he's going doing the same task but why
[1:59:17] is he not feeling the pain
[1:59:20] there is something about the revelation
[1:59:25] i don't even know how to express
[1:59:28] when you are afraid
[1:59:31] your whole house
[1:59:33] is anointed with that revelation with
[1:59:35] that anointing
[1:59:38] anybody you understand
[1:59:42] do you understand what i'm saying
[1:59:45] if a past if we get caught up
[1:59:48] in what is good happening in this world
[1:59:51] we won't have service in this place
[1:59:54] [Music]
[1:59:57] i will be the only one preaching here
[1:59:59] and everybody at home streaming
[2:00:02] everybody here but if that
[2:00:05] revelation comes differently

[2:00:08] when you get in this place you even
[2:00:10] forgot we're under a pandemic
[2:00:16] you don't even remember there is a
[2:00:18] pandemic going on you don't even
[2:00:20] understand that outside there there is a
[2:00:22] new strain that came up why are you not
[2:00:24] scared
[2:00:26] why you keep shaking hand
[2:00:29] why are you not scared
[2:00:31] because there is something in you and
[2:00:33] when the death that's why you heard
[2:00:34] brother branham say when the devil sees
[2:00:37] that
[2:00:38] when the devil sees that
[2:00:40] the demon themselves back up you don't

[2:02:26] differently you don't feel what is going
[2:02:29] on

[2:02:38] i want to be this
[2:02:40] so even though they are struggling
[2:02:42] studying they don't sleep well but
[2:02:44] because of that vision

[2:02:53] this
[2:02:54] it was that vision that was carrying you
[2:02:57] up

[2:03:47] same thing and they complicate somebody
[2:03:49] and they let you pass somebody come and
[2:03:50] say i want to pass but when they look at
[2:03:52] your face
[2:03:54] he said go ahead where's your id
[2:03:58] why did they make him go there is
[2:03:59] something
[2:04:01] when this man is awakened he anoints you
[2:04:06] and when your family look at you they
[2:04:08] see mommy a certain way and the children
[2:04:11] also get courage
[2:04:13] and the whole house is changing
[2:04:16] and you sitting there you don't even

[2:04:38] and one of this day you're gonna hear
[2:04:40] one of your child speaking in tongues
[2:04:46] because you are creating an atmosphere
[2:04:49] and the devil when the sunset those
[2:04:51] demons themselves go away
[2:04:55] and you can go to sleep without any
[2:04:57] problem

[2:05:59] father for speaking to us again about
[2:06:02] the holy spirit
[2:06:04] lord we know
[2:06:06] that probably some of us are still
[2:06:08] struggling of certain things
[2:06:10] and the only thing is they don't want to
[2:06:12] let it go
[2:06:14] if lord we can self-examine ourselves
[2:06:17] and make sure that between that which we
[2:06:20] are struggling
[2:06:22] and as
[2:06:23] there is not a love connection
[2:06:27] if there is a pure separation in the
[2:06:30] inner man there is no way that demon can
[2:06:33] stand anymore
[2:06:34] because there is no ground
[2:06:37] father
[2:06:38] lord may the holy spirit continue to
[2:06:41] minister to your children
[2:06:43] lord strengthen
[2:06:44] your children
[2:06:46] and let them be enraptured into the
[2:06:49] reigns into the dimension of revelation
[2:06:52] and vision because that is what is
[2:06:54] keeping us moving forward
[2:06:57] despite the opposition despite the trial
[2:07:01] despite the battle we can keep our head
[2:07:04] up knowing lord father that there is a
[2:07:06] hope and a reward on the other side

[2:07:24] even have to scream
[2:07:26] but they know who we are because we are
[2:07:29] that chosen generation
[2:07:32] father may they depart from your
[2:07:34] children and may your children be
[2:07:36] completely free and may lord the holy
[2:07:39] spirit only that you have purpose in
[2:07:41] your heart to work lord and to prepare
