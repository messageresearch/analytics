okay okay okay okay blessed be the name of the lord i believe you reading your cod book the question and answer is for this coming saturday at 2 30 brother robert 2 30 buddy kelly 2 30 so you will receive the text message i believe the last question should be tonight i already have a lot amen i have like 19 questions that was sent to me again and some of them are very good and i could not answer the person i asked the person if i can put it for the whole church because it will benefit i can answer that person but you would not know amen praise be the name of the lord so remember question and answer this saturday at 2 30. so it has been announced over and over so if you don't show up that's your problem amen let's go straight to the scripture if we can what's the devil trying to do again tonight let's go to genesis chapter two [Music] glory to god amen i know it's wednesday i'm trying to push a little bit forward if not we're on the deep honey and it's hard to swim amen blessed be the name of the lord let me know when you're ready if not i already have a backup here genesis chapter 2 verse 20. if you dare you can say amen we read this over and over the bible says and adam gave name to all caddo and to the file of the air you might be seated and to every beast of the field but for adam there was not found a help made for him everybody okay in other words everybody was a pair male and female amen it doesn't mean that adam was really alone right because the animal were there the fishes were there the elephant was there the zebra was there the rhino was there amen adam was not truly alone in that aspect when they say adam was alone it's that he didn't have his help mate amen somebody that looked like him amen so right there there is a difference in the kingdoms glory to god there was not found a help made for adam amen so there is a difference in the kingdom amen we got the fowls we got the fishes everybody care we got the cattle and the beast amen we got the creeping things if you read your genesis you should be good amen and we got man who was created in the image and in the likeness of god everybody okay so these everybody everything in the file was two a pair in a fish is a pair in the car a pair in the creeping things a pair so adam was not really alone he was the god of the earth remember on sunday but what makes him alone is his female part amen hey buddy clear his help mate was missing amen amen praise god hallelujah verse 21 and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh we get to this down the road because there's a lot of things laying there and close up the flesh and instead thereof and the rib which the lord god has taken from man made he a woman you remember it's not if yet it is a woman amen i hope somebody is not tired from work brother kalim is not here some of the folks are not here so you need to compensate amen hallelujah and brought her to man verse 23 and adam say this is now born of my bones and flesh of my flesh and she shall be called a woman because she was taken out of man everybody okay therefore shall men leave his father and his mother and shall cling to his wife and they too and they shall be one flesh sorry and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed in other words the marriage was not consumed i have scripture on that but i don't know how far we can go tonight go to genesis chapter 3 verse 1 now the serpent you understand this now was more subtle the serpent you understand what it means now right he was more subtle amen he was more subtle than any beast you understand his category now of the field which the lord god had made and he said to the woman yea has god said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden we will see what that it means i know you know it i'm going to grind you in the scripture amen let's go to verse 13 and the lord god said to the woman what is this that you have done and the woman said the serpent begot or seduced me and i did eat everybody okay watch verse 14 and the lord god said to the serpent because you have done this you are cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field remember on the fifth day there were three categories that were created you remember we got the caddo we got the beast and we got the creeping things amen but the serpent was removed from this category this sub category amen because he was an upright creature amen amen everybody okay hallelujah the bible says that he was he would be cursed above all cuddle and above every beast of the field upon your belly so he was not walking on his belly anybody care he was an upright creature right here everybody so they move him from here to here everybody okay and since the curse changed him in other words he moved from a standing position here into a fallen position okay back here and since he fell amen there is no redemption for him amen you cannot reverse that back even in the millennium you won't have the serpent anymore the species called the serpent disappear forever you will only have a snake right here he's a serpent but over here he's a snake amen the snake is the cursed version [Music] amen and that's the shall you eat all the days of your life and i will put enmity between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed so both of them have seeds he shall bruise your head and you shall bruise his heel everybody okay let's go to leviticus chapter 18 glory to god [Laughter] amen let's go to leviticus chapter 18 if you dare you can say amen hallelujah so there is one creature that when he fell never can go back again the way he was he fell eternally the serpent fall eternally that's it nothing happened anymore amen leviticus chapter 18 verse 11 if you dare you can say amen [Music] all right the bible says the nakedness of your father's wife's daughter what does he mean we okay that's what you call half sister everybody okay so we take a father right here amen a father have is married to his wife everybody okay amen but he had another child by another woman which we know about polygamy we don't believe in it everybody okay because god opened the flesh he took one and he closed back up everybody okay we know that right adam never i mean abraham never wanted to be a polygamist he was his wife anybody care okay no problem so if he got another child a daughter from another woman amen he's still the daughter of this man [Music] everybody okay this is what the scripture says now so he might have we're talking about another woman here amen do i have a daughter so he might have a daughter right here and another daughter over there both of them belongs to him because the bloodline comes from the man everybody okay okay that's what i want you to understand the bible say the nakedness of that of your father's wife daughter that daughter begotten of your father amen in other words you're under the same blood amen she is your sister even though it's a different mother but she is your sister everybody okay she's your sister you shall not uncover her nakedness in other words you cannot marry a daughter like that [Music] amen amen it is an unlawful relationship okay where are you going with this job to verse 23 i thought we were talking about the serpent verse 23 if you dare you can say amen neither shall you lie with any beast where did they learn this you see that it's in the scripture everybody here neither shall you lie with any beast to defy yourself there with so god calls a relationship between a human and the beast incorrect [Music] everybody okay why is it incorrect because in the garden of eden they are under different category we okay now okay now that's why adam was alone did he make sense now did he make sense now adam was not alone in the sense that there was nothing in the earth no the lion was there the zebra was there amen but adam was alone that there was not another human being like adam who can meet with adam everybody okay so crossing these lines is something wrong everybody okay let me go back again to let me take us my friend amen verse 23 neither shall you lie with any beast to defy yourself there with neither shall any woman clear stand before air beast everybody okay to lie down therefore there are two it is uh so a relationship between a woman and a beast god called that a confusion amen hey in other words you cannot marry the daughter of your father even though she is born from another woman it is a wrong an inordinate passion everybody okay you call her half-sister she's your sister that's what the bible say by the blood everybody okay everybody okay so the unlawful relationship are not only between human and beast but they can be between human and human amen amen am i reading a different bible between human and human if you go home take leviticus 18 and begin to read it they will tell you you can you shall not they could be the i mean uncover the necklace of your mother all of that it's allowful even though it's human anybody here blessed be the name of the lord let's go to the book of acts then we pray again in ended different category because man is made in an image and likeness of god man is the highest specie amen you don't leave that and drop under into a different category you don't cross when you cross god say it's a confusion everybody okay what are you using these tools for act 13 this is what we read on sunday verse six and then we will pray you there and when they had gone through the of paphos they found a certain sorcery you remember this on sunday a false prophet you remember on sunday a jew from the tribe of judah you remember this on sunday whose name was water do you know what he means about jesus simons bar son of jonas so this man is called the son of jesus the son of jesus but this son of jesus is from the tribe of judah can you imagine and he is using sorcery [Music] amen and he is also a false prophet [Music] and jesus was from the tribe of judah and jesus didn't use sorcery he was filled with the holy spirit and jesus was a true prophet everybody okay blessed be the name of the lord verse seven which was with the deputy of the country sergi's palace a prudent man who called for barnabas and saw the messenger and the minister desiring to hear the word of god but elimas this is another name for about jesus the sorcerer for so is his name by interpretation withstood them this man did two things number one he withstood paul [Music] and barnabas paul is the messenger and barnabas is the minister under the messenger we okay now he withstood them seeking to turn away the deputy from water the reason why he's doing this the purpose is to turn someone away from what from the faith amen what is in this man everybody okay that is aiming to turn somebody away from the faith in other words there is a faith that was once delivered to the sand he was already delivered amen and someone is coming to turn someone away from the faith but what is the tool that eliminates what are the tools that god jesus is using [Music] everybody okay let's see the tools then so who also is called poor filled with the holy ghost in other words paul now is not using his natural spirit that's what the scripture is telling you paul was a man but the scripture wants you to understand that now there is an anointing on paul it is not paul anybody okay it is the holy spirit in paul that is working now [Music] paul had something lord jesus had something anybody care in paul it was the holy ghost what was involved jesus the son of jesus the name was given to cover up everybody okay now son filled with the holy ghost set his eyes on him so when paul was looking it was not paul that was looking everybody okay he was the holy ghost through paul because paul was a prophet the holy ghost began to use the prophetic eye of paul to zoom in to zoom in about jesus and to begin to detect or to diagnose what is in blood jesus that he's using to turn somebody away from the faith everybody okay it's wednesday my friend already verse 10 hallelujah and said this is the holy ghost speaking in power oh full of water so the first two this man has is subtlety everybody okay and the serpent was the master everybody okay you already got the answer right [Music] the two he has is subtility thank you jesus amen is full not just ability full of it [Music] amen let's go to first man paul was full you saw it you see it paul was filled with the holy ghost and this man also was filled with something [Music] so it is not paul it is not about jesus there is two opponents we inside one another that are fighting everybody okay glory to god he says subtility and all water he's using mischief amen mischief amen you chad after did you see the devil giving birth to this man i'm going slowly so we can get it did you see the devil telling you i have a child his name is bart jesus so bro jesus the son of jesus is not really the son of jesus he's the son of who let me put a star there he is the son of the devil amen hallelujah son of chad of the devil enemy of all unrighteousness enemy of god amen enemy of all our righteousness will you not cease to do what who perverts god creates god create but somebody take what god has created and do what anybody okay so he's a perverter there is a art of perversion amen hallelujah who not cease to pervert the right ways of who [Music] it's a perversion not just perversion but perversion of the right ways amen of who of the lord amen so this armamentarium is in this man and he uses this to turn somebody away from thee everybody okay let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly tonight father thanking you for your grace for your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father i have done what any man that you give an ability to do can do lord but as far as opening the word blessing your children touching their life and changing them it's a supernatural action of the holy spirit father may you move me completely out of the way may you come and speak to your children may the devil and his army be completely sealed out and may only the holy spirit and the elect angels be in this building to minister to your children father remember those that are streaming online may you bless them and be with us lord father as we committed all and ask it in the name of jesus christ amen i just want to remind you this quick brother branham say you remember this now let this be known scripture does not play with words amen whatever is in the record in the bible is there for the anointed eyes to see it is there for a purpose amen my subject tonight is the four faces of roof from satan to the beast everybody okay part three we on the threshing floor we're dealing with the second oil but on the tabernacle language we are in the holiest brother branham says this that everything just a reminder that is today that is had its beginning and everything that there is begin in genesis remember life beginning genesis we saw that on sunday and life was a person and life was a tree death began in genesis and death was a person and death was a tree remember on sunday and all touch begin in genesis right and wrong or beginning genesis if you study the scripture real closely amen you will find out that even the ism and the quotes of today had their beginning in genesis if you shall watch nimrod then different one in the scripture all them is that we have today begin in genesis now today they polish it up and make it look like something else they can call it about jesus [Music] and right here if you get stuck with the name you're going to be deceived because the name said the son of jesus but the one who was in the son of jesus was the devil amen so do not worry about the name even if they say message believer you need to see who is in that message believer does he have the holy ghost or not if there is no holy ghost put them aside wait until they are filled with the holy spirit everybody cares so far brother branham said but it's still that old spirit evil spirit if you shall watch the nature of it and the way that he acts so remember this as we're moving through this we looked at matthew 25 where we spoke about the virgin we found out that all those virgins was espoused they were not married they were only engaged and them being engaged spoke about the ministry of paul because paul say i have a sparse you into one husband everybody okay in order to present you as a chess virgin so paul was struggling doing everything that he can to keep the church virgin amen why everybody here and those virgins some are foolish some are wise everybody clear and we found out that at midnight on sunday that the midnight cry happened at the seventh watch everybody okay and in the seventh watch brother branham said it was malachi fall which was the second oil everybody okay so far amen and then that oil is what made the wise virgin to be wise that's why we call it the oil of wisdom everybody okay and the wisdom of god we found through the scripture was crossed because the bible said that christ is the wisdom of god everybody okay now we have two wisdom we have the wisdom of god everybody okay which is christ and we have also the wisdom of the devil where do you get this open first corinthians chapter 2 glory to god first corinthians chapter 2 if you dare you can say amen keep your bible handy as we're leaving the airport it's a night flight amen so i'm using the gps amen first corinthians chapter two if you there you can say amen verse six i want you to follow me carefully there are two wisdom we have the wisdom of god which we already went through this and the wisdom of god is who because the bible say christ is the wisdom of god ever here now we're trying to look at the wisdom of the devil or the other wisdom amen how does he operate first corinthians chapter two if you dare you can say amen let's go to verse six the bible says this is paul however we speak what wisdom among them that are perfect everybody okay yet not the wisdom of this world amen here so there is two wisdom that are operating in the world everybody here there is the we we have the wisdom of god and another wisdom which process that it's the wisdom of the world and this word word brother what i'm saying is cosmos amen praise god paul says that however we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the priests of this world that come to water so if you follow this wisdom it would take you to nothing everybody if you follow the world and the things of the world it will bring you on to nothing in other words you're going to hit a dead end amen amen everybody okay what does this wisdom do job two verse seven but we speak the wisdom of god everybody okay we already went through this inner mystery you know what it means now even the hidden wisdom it's hidden which god ordained before the foundation before the world to our glory everybody okay watch now which none of the places of this world know amen everybody okay because there are two camp if you belong to this camp you're going to miss this wisdom ever here because this wisdom is the wisdom of the world the wisdom of the princes of the world amen and none of them receive the wisdom of god anybody okay what have they done with their wisdom everybody okay verse uh eight which none of the princes of this world knew for had they know it everybody okay they will not have crucified the lord of water so if you know the wisdom of god everybody okay you will never crucify jesus everybody okay there is a first crucifixion that happened in israel but in decent time there is a second crucifixion amen but if you are connected to the wisdom of god you will never crucify jesus christ the second time again [Music] in other words you will never blaspheme christ everybody here but if somebody does not have this wisdom amen but he has the wisdom of the world or the wisdom of the devil that person will end up crucifying jesus christ everybody okay what i'm trying to say is this the wisdom of the devil lead to killing everybody okay he leads to crucifixion amen amen everybody okay hallelujah open uh the book of john chapter 8 as we navigate it john chapter 8 if you dare you can say amen amen verse 39 are you there the jews are speaking to jesus and what are they saying pages are still turning john chapter 8 verse 39 you there you can say amen they answer him and say to him abraham is our father [Music] they can take you to the laboratory you can draw the dna test you will find out that it matches abraham remember a lemurs bro jesus was a jew but he was filled with the devil everybody okay amen anybody okay now now the bible says that they say that abraham is our father jesus said to them if you were abraham's children which they were so what kind of child is jesus speaking jesus was not talking about the natural children remember he said if you are abraham children you will do the work of who abraham everybody here so to be a child of abraham you don't have to worry about being born in the nation of israel amen everybody okay you might be born in in whatever nation you are born the problem is we want to see your work [Music] everybody if you do the work of abraham then you are a child of abraham everybody okay let's jump again hallelujah verse 40. but now you seek to do whatever stop a lot of me the wisdom of death this word juarta i'm going slowly we okay you seek to kill me a man that has stole you the water so when you tell people the truth when you preach the truth [Music] and opposition begin to rise up you know who is working on the other hand everybody okay glory to god which i have heard of god this did not abraham in other words help abraham never behave like this everybody we know the children of abraham by their behavior everybody okay verse 41 you do the deeds of your father oh if abraham is not their father who is the father of these people because you can trust them by lineage this one will tell you i was born from the tribe of asher i was born from the tribe of judah i was born from the tribe of robin but jesus said your father is different amen remember a lemur's about jesus was a jew but when paul looked at him through the holy ghost he said you are a child of the devil everybody okay now verse now uh 41 you do the deeds of your father then say dead to him we be not born of fornication they were looking for something to show them which was not even true amen they were propagating a lie and they thought that that is something they can shoot him amen we have one father even who so they are claiming god to be their father [Music] verse 42 you ready now jesus said to them if god were your father you would do what you will love me for i proceeded forth and came from god neither came i of myself but he sent me everybody why do you not understand my what everything i'm saying you can't get it what is wrong you cannot decode my language you cannot decode my wisdom amen amen to decode the wisdom of god you must be a child of god amen that's why when the message come you are not the one decoding the message there is a predestinated seed of you from god that pick up the message and decree the message for you and you say oh now i see it is not you it is the predestinated seed that is recognizing the message of god [Applause] [Music] hallelujah even because you cannot hear my word verse 44 this is where i get you you are of your father the who [Music] did the devil give birth to them what is the connection you are of your father the devil and the lust in other words the desires of your father you will do he was a water [Music] the wisdom of the devil does what everybody okay anybody okay he was a murderer from the beginning amen stop who did satan murder at the beginning [Music] i'm asking you a question go search the scripture and show me where satan killed somebody at the beginning but i know somebody who killed someone at the beginning but here his name was kane but they said your father was a murderer from the beginning amen here if came murder at the beginning which see this came from [Music] you see how easy things are okay not only is he a murderer everybody okay karma you ready and a bird or remain not in the water there is no way you can contain him in the world he must stay for a season after a while he need to go anybody here and he a bad not in the truth because the reason why he doesn't abide is because there is no truth in water so what makes you stay in the message [Music] everybody okay everybody okay it was not you the message was already in you that's why you are staying in the message [Applause] amen you cannot stand in the message if the message was not in you but if the message was in you before the foundation of the word whether you understand it or not you will stick with the message and go all the way to the end [Music] [Applause] [Music] you might testify certain things you never understood them but you stuck in the message amen it was not about an understanding it was about what was inside amen when that is in there whether you understand it or not you just gonna stay put if they ask you what else do you see in this message you say i don't know but i cannot go where should i go you have the world of eternal life where else should i go which church should i go everybody okay he says when he speaks yes ally he speaks it off his own he's a generator of lies amen for he is a liar amen and the father of it so the wisdom of the devil is a wisdom that killeth [Music] everybody okay let's go to mark chapter 15 then i'm going to drive quickly mark chapter 15. if you dare you can say amen why are we dealing with wisdom because the bible says in ezekiel chapter 28 you remember this on sunday the king of paris the name changes he said that silly fab the word the psalm full of water full of wisdom what kind of wisdom and perfect in water so outside it looks beautiful but on the inside it will kill you everybody here if you approach it it will kill you everybody okay and that wisdom was where in eden [Music] we okay now let's go to mark 15. if you dare you can say amen mark 15 verse 7 then i'm gonna drive quick you there and there was one named barabbas which laid banned with them that had made insurrection a bandit with him who had committed water murder in the water so there is a man called barabbas a murderer everybody okay okay okay you okay you okay they bring the holy people and they told them we have two candidates we have a murderer proven by the law and murderer everybody and we have an innocent man which there is nothing else but he's doing healing and doing good things to the people who would you choose your choice is based on what is in it [Music] can i continue verse 8 and the multitude cry aloud began to desire him to do as he ever done to them in other words do what you got to do you usually release one person but pilot as answer them saying will you that are released to you the king of the jews for he knew everybody okay that the chief priest had delivered him for water stop who manifested envy the first time in the bible let me help you up one day god asked two boys bring me the offering one chose his offering according to his revelation they are the one chosen offering according to the revelation when god agreed to one offering the other one rose up with what and did what everybody okay and the chief priests delivered jesus by what let's continue verse 11 but the chief priests you okay they moved the people you see that they move the people that they should rather release barabbas to them and pilate answered and say again to them what will you then that i shall do to him who you call the king of the jews in other words the response of the people was not really the people it was the priest that got into the people and gave them the word and gave them the wisdom and gave them a different wisdom because paul said if they have known the wisdom of christ they would not have crucified the problem everybody okay so there was another wisdom in the priest and that wisdom started with envy but he always end up with a murderer everybody okay praise god and politician uh verse 13 and they cry out again saying water in other words give us the murderer everybody okay but crucify the lord amen it's a different wisdom anybody okay it's a different wisdom amen that's why you need the second oil ever here because the second oil will bring you the wisdom of christ for you to know how to avoid amen getting in trouble with the lord everybody okay so far blessed be the name of the lord if you notice when the virgin left because when the rose they found out that they don't have oil in their lamp amen only the wise virgins have the the oil amen and they ask the foolish say to unto the wise give us of you all for our lamp are going out if you go everybody okay verse 9 the wise virgin told them you go buy it by yourself we cannot share the soil it is a personal oil ever here and they want to buy the oil everybody okay when they want to buy the oil the bible says why they want to buy they were not going to play everybody okay the bridegroom came and did there were water what makes them ready it was the second oil that made them ready to meet the bridegroom but here they were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was water the story never stopped everybody okay the virgin came back everybody okay and they look at the door everybody okay so certainly they receive some oil am i reading a different bible please open matthew 25 [Music] [Laughter] glory to god up in matthew 25 i didn't put it here i don't want you to say brother stephen say the bible says and brother branham say amen amen jump to verse 11. if you're there you can say amen you there afterward came also i'm good in time came also the other virgins the foolish saying lord lord do what they want to buy all right everybody and they came back with oil everybody here but that all came after the midnight zone [Music] amen what are you trying to say after the second oil everybody here end me i'll upcoming all is a tribulation anointing [Music] amen everybody here every all that is separate from the second oil every anointing that is separate from the opening of the seals that come after will only take the people in the tribulation but here because it's only the second one that will make you ready to go meet the bridegroom if you miss that oil every other anointing you can get is a tribulation anointing everybody okay that's why you need to be careful with what you follow in the pentecostal world they might have an anointing but their anointing will never make it to the blood group here they can heal the sick they can prophesy that he will take them through the tribulation everybody here so don't be impressed with pentecostal don't be impressed with baptism don't be impressed with catholics their anointing will take them nowhere only the second only anointing will take you in the rapture [Music] everybody here ever here in genesis 18 in genesis 18 there were three messengers are we okay you want me to stop there were three messengers everybody okay two of them went to saw them they were an anointed angel [Music] everybody okay but the gospel only blinded the people [Applause] everybody here everybody here out of sodom do you know how many people they saved they only save three people do you know that they save a lot and who else those two they are there were they married how are they [Music] open your bible open your body open your bible open your bible open your bible let's go to genesis 19. i don't want you to say brother stephen saying they are saved but under tribulation amen no matter what billy graham did no matter what oral roberts doing the gospel will never make it don't worry my friend there is three seeds brother branham said spoken word he said there is an evangelical seed by billy graham there is a pentecostal seed by over rabbit and there is also the the bread one the seed of the brother the spoken word seed amen you need to know which seed you belong to because the other two will not take you to meet the bridegroom let's go to genesis 18. i don't want you to say brother stephen you there you there [Music] oh glory to god let's go to verse four but before they lay down the men of the city even the men of sodom come pass the house run both old and young all the people from every quarter and they called to lord and say to him where are the men which came into you this night bring them out to us that we may know them amen and lot went out of the door he opened the door slowly and held the door like this then when he was assad close the door so he's protecting the door anybody okay he held the door after him and he said i pray you water brethren the breathing of lord the brethren of lord i pray you brethren do not sow what behold now i have can you say it aloud i have two daughters which water so those daughters were water everybody okay they were virgin amen but when they came out of sodom everybody okay because their mother also died only two virgins came out everybody okay they are not so in other words the message of the two angels could only save two virgins amen but those women even though they were virgins they were foolish virgins because they went and slept with their father they were not wise virgin but here they went and slept with their own father they were not wise virgins even though they were saved so what i'm trying to say is any anointing that is separate from the second oil will take you in the tribulation it is a tribulation anointing amen so don't be impressed in the pentecostal world because the bible say many shall come in my name and they will say have we not prophesied have we not cast our devil have we not done a lot of miracles and jesus said i never knew you because it's a tribulation anointing that the nominal believer like who has got he's going through the water tribulation period and be safe after he was by fire noah went through the tribulation period carried above it came out with him who polluted the earth again lot came out his own water did what you can read it at home and had children by his own water but abraham brought forth the water because somebody was with abraham that was discerning the thought and the intent of the heart that was a separate message that's the brad message [Music] everybody okay he says he brought forth the seed of the promise enoch went to glory in the water just took a walk and went home he never went through the water the other oil even though it's oil you won't make it with it there is only one oil that makes you ready it's the oil that is make you wise and it's all of christ christ who is the wisdom of god everybody okay so far so that's why we understand that it's very important to understand that what we have is more than power [Music] we have power plus you remember on sunday amen because paul said that i know in part so the knowledge of paul was important [Music] and he also prophesied in part so paul was a prophet everybody okay but when that which is perfect is come that which is part is water we already explained you this and we found out that paul was afraid why he was afraid he said i'm afraid i fear because as the serpent began eve through water subtlety subtlety what is sability my friend amen brother problem says this that's the big the beast from the beginning you remember on sunday he was the best at the garden of eden everybody okay and he is the beast at the end and shows that he is a religious person and a denomination everybody okay so far now on sunday we established two adam okay the bible says that the first man adam was made a living soul it's written in genesis and the last adam not the second last so you don't bring another one amen was made a quickening spirit everybody okay paul now explained this he says how bit that was not first which is spiritual in other words the spiritual adam never came first the one who started was a natural adam amen in genesis you would never see jesus there because because jesus is the second adam the one who started is adam the natural man paul said not the first which is spiritual but that which is what nacho adam and after all that which is what so first is start with adam then jesus will follow adam amen the first man is on earth they pull him from the ground hey but here earthly but the second man is the lord from what ever here so on sunday we establish two adam amen we found out that in heaven god was the president you remember amen glory to god and on the earth and the vice president of heaven was lucifer we we gave you all the detail on sunday amen and we found on the earth because adam was the god of the earth we found that the president was adam amen if you didn't catch this you go back on sunday and the first president was who we demonstrated this clearly and we found that the serpent was the vice president amen now that serpent paul was afraid of the subtlety of the serpent amen on sunday we found out that the word subtility means to be smart everybody okay to be crafty everybody here but brother branham added another one he says that the best interpretation the easiest one is to be crafty is to be smart everybody can get that amen but brother branham said the best so subtity first we spoke on sunday that it's smart we spoke on sunday that it's to be crafty we found out that amen because the serpent was the more sadder but brother branham said the best definition is coming from the hebrew word that means maha what does it means it means somebody that is heaven everybody here a chew amen knowledge of what of the principles of life what does it mean [Music] you already understand smart you understand crafty let's get into this a little bit you ready let's go to the book of uh second samuel chapter 13. if i can push this we'll be good on sunday if you dare you can say amen second samuel chapter 13 glory to god if a young sister is here do not sleep if you unlined do not sleep amen you there listen to me carefully [Music] you there let's navigate verse 1. now praise god paul says that i'm struggling all i want to do is i have fiancee you i have engaged you i have inspired you i want to present you to christ as a water chaste virgin amen god introduce eve unto adam as a water chest virgin everybody okay okay praise god verse one and he came to pass after this that absalom we okay now are we okay is he opening or not yet let's dig on absalom the son of david had a fair sister a beautiful one you look everybody all the boys are talking about her anybody here whose name was temer hey margie absalom the bible say he was the son of david amen are we okay [Music] absalom was the son of david can i do this brother robert don't betray me absalom [Laughter] absalom was who the son of david amen and ammon was who son of david anybody here and tema was who daughter of david are we okay you want me to continue oh you got it we got it the daughter of david amen but ammon the son of david loved her this is not a normal love amen let's make this a little bit more clear keep your finger there let's go to chapter 3 because we're gonna see how did the serpent move from satan how did satan move from satan to be the serpent if i can track this quickly let's go to chapter three keep your finger right there second samuel chapter two uh chapter three are you there you're there all right verse two you there and death and to david were sons born in hebrew the firstborn was who of ahinoam the jezreelite so the mother of ammon is a hinohum everybody okay with me everybody okay with me few people everybody okay with me verse three and he second kill him of abigail another wife the wife of neighbor the caramel you know the story everybody okay and the third son was absalom the son of who makkah so absalom and emon did they do were they coming from the same mother everybody okay they were coming from the same father amen absalom and temer have the same matter amen amen so am a temer to amon was the daughter of david's wife do you remember the viticus do you remember the viticus so david has hinohama and david has mecca everybody here mecca produced hima amen and he no ham produced ammon but both of them came from david amen so this is david's wife daughter we okay now and according to leviticus everybody okay we okay now there is no way ammon can marry tema because it's against the law we okay now we okay now praise god now let's go back to second samuel chapter 13 we're there verse one and he came to pass after this that absalom i still i'm so good on time that absalom the son of david had the first sister from makkah whose name was temer and ammon from ahinoham the son of david loved her so right here we have an inordinate relationship everybody okay a love that is out of order anybody care a love that cannot cross together we okay praise god verse two we are studying the word maha subtility what does it mean the principles of life verse two and a man was so vexed this boy got even sick amen he got so vexed miserable that he felt sick what a love people who say that wow he loved his wife that's hollywood love anybody here oh i'm dying for you you are you really dying how are you going to get married to me if you're dying hollywood and when you get home you don't want to die so don't follow those words without you i cannot sleep that's a trouble if we're going to get home you don't sleep anymore liars ever here just to please you let's continue sidetrack stop pulling the way you're pulling leave me on the highway amen and ammon was so fixed that he felt sick for his sister tema for she was a water [Music] power want to present the brother eve was still here what is troubling this man is because his sister is virgin [Music] what is in this man that is after the virginity of her sister let's go slowly i'm reading the scripture amen he felt sick that she was a virgin and ammon taught it hard in other words impossible amen impossible for him to do anything to her so ammon loves tema why because of virginity and she was also a beautiful woman amen but ammon looked you follow me and found out that it is impossible for him to reach them in other words tema is sheltered i'm going slowly in other words tema is protected in other words tema have a fortifying hedge that when ammon try it doesn't work he try it doesn't work how can i break the wall of tamar we okay are we okay we're trying to understand subtility you there verse three but emon had a friend that he loved so much we ready now whose name was john adam the son of shimaya david water everybody okay and jonathan was a very we're going so i have not even finished jonathan was a very wetter so emon tried every corner he cannot penetrate amen therefore the fortification the layer of protection around tamar amen but there was somebody very close in the family he was not outside the family he was a very close cousin that was sitting there but that cousin was very what is the subtitle of this cousin about to do to a virgin everybody okay verse four and he said to him why are you being a king son lean day from day you're a king child you're always miserable like this why you're supposed to be happy your father have everything what's wrong amen will you not tell me and everyone said to him i love them my brother's absalom sister and jordan have said to him lay you down on your bed amen and make yourself sick where is this inspiration coming from amen temer in her home dancing singing religious song amen playing around as a daughter as a virgin happy cooking but the serpent is somewhere [Music] amen eve playing in the garden of eden moving around in a garden of eden is going around looking at flower smelling flower playing with the zebra running around never knew the serpent was right there can i continue can i continue the trail of the serpent everybody okay and john adapt say lay you down on your bed and make yourself sick when your father come to see you say to him say to you the father his name is who a prophet is coming but there is a way to deviate to the prophet david was a prophet the bible says that i already gave you the scripture if you need it go to the book of acts you're going to see it amen but there is a way to deviate in other words stemma was protected by david protected under a prophet [Applause] how can i get around the prophet how can i go around the prophet when i'm on try the prophetic anointing is moving along when i'm on trial the prophetic anointing is moving on then the serpent approach [Music] we okay young sister wake up amen lay you down on your bed and make yourself sick and when your father comes to see you say to him i pray you let my sister tell me come and give me meat and dress me meat in my sight that i may sit and eat it off her hand did he add anything did he say anything else that's over he delivered the message here watch verse six and ammon lay down and made himself sick and when the king was come to see him ammon said to the king who was talking was ammon talking or was jonathan talking jonah in ammon are we okay are we okay [Applause] did you get it [Music] did you get it we got jonathan jonadab amen who's very sad and we got ammon amen amen jonah delivered the message to ammon and over here there is tamar temer who is protected by david amen so john airmon when he is talking you need to have discernment you will think you are talking to a man by you not talking to ammon ammon became jonah that made flesh so when our money is talking you can call ammon [Music] [Applause] don't be caught up with them with the face of ammon don't be caught up with the appearance of ammon don't be caught up with what you know about ammon because john adam is already flesh in ammon how did satan become the beast [Music] [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay so when eve is talking to the serpent and the serpents say have god have already told you that you shall not eat of every tree eve was not talking to the serpent eve was talking to the devil mad flesh in the serpent [Applause] that's why brother branham preached the discernment of the spirit you need to catch the spirit what is the spirit behind because the name might change the mask my change the physiological might change but it's the same old devil it is the same spirit it is the same anointing glory to god i need to land this ship buddy i wish i was on sunday amen let me search for the airport can i continue it's a night amen let me search for the airport i don't know if there is traffic at the airport amen are you there verse six and a month lay down and made himself sick and when the king was to come to him ammon said to the king i pray you let him or my sister come and make me a couple of cake in my sight that i may eat at her hand then david sent everybody okay everybody okay the word the gospel of jonah dab can open the house of david [Music] anybody here john adam never called hima he used a gospel and david himself opened the house i can take this and go to the parent and show how things happen at home because parents are missing discernment and they are opening doors to journal daddy you're opening doors to john adams amen but let me pull from that exit and keep myself on the highway everybody okay i just exit and i'm going back to the exit again everybody okay and then david sent home saying go now to your brother emma house to dress him water so tema went to her brother elmo's house and he lay he was laid down and she took flour and knead it and make cake in his side and did back the cake and she took a pen and poured them out before him but he refused to eat and almonds say have all the men from me and they went out every man from him signal sister i want to meet with you but i don't want nobody to be there you think you can handle the serpent you'll find yourself in a hotel and you don't know how you got in the hotel because you cannot handle the serpent amen and almond said to them bring me the meat into the water everybody okay that i may eat off your hand and tamar took the cake he no scent girl the protection is already down the balls are down which she has made and brought them into the chamber of amnon her brother and when she had brought them to him to eat he took a hold of her and said to her come lie with me my sister which love is this inordinate love it is against the law amen and she answered him name my brother do not force me for no such thing or to be done in israel do not use this word [Music] folly it's fully can i continue and uh and let me drop down to verse for the sake of time let me jump down to verse 15 uh 14. however he will not hearken to her voice but being stronger than she force her and lay with her then ammon can i continue he hated her how exceedingly so that the hatred where with he hated her was greater than the love is this real love well if he had loved her are you there and amman said to her arise and go water and be gone everybody here jump to verse 17 then he called his servant because them say i'm not going nowhere you already did this to me i'm staying here verse 17. then he called his servant that minister to him and say put now tamar [Music] i thought her name was tema but he's calling her uh in the beginning did eve have a name eve was color water [Music] did we get it did we get it now it's no more tema it is ah it was the beast against though [Music] what are you trying to say what i'm trying to say is subtly give the serpent number one the ability to deviate somebody from the faith and number two he gives the ability to break virginity and the serpent was sadder very sad though the native beast of the field everybody here brother branham said the only way for satan to accomplish what he wanted to do was to enter the water because subtlety was already there and if it's shelter everybody care so the only way i can get into and destroy this woman i need subtility and subtility was already in the serpent and subtlety knows how to break the wall of protection and get and destroy virginity everybody okay the trail of the serpent he says and the only way was to enter the serpent in eden even as he entered by evil spirit into the swan of gaga edgardo god does not enter so right here we have now we understand that satan always uses the system of a beast can now continue satan can enter human being but he can also enter animal amen let me continue god does not enter animal but satan can and will to accomplish water he could not have a child directly by eve as did god by mary no creation remember on sunday so he entered into the serpent and then began eve he said use hair and by hair did satan have a child vicariously cain brought the full spiritual characteristic of who and the animalistic essential fleshly characteristic of water now the true relationship between human and beast head cross unlawful in other words subtimity can is professional to unlawful relationship amen everybody here let me get here and finish it no wonder the holy spirit said that cain was off the water that's why the beast satan what branham says this in revelation 11 i can't get to this variable in revelation 13 all of them are locked i can drop into this in revelation 17 there were beasts in other words you go to this three chapter you will see the name beast everybody you go to revelation 11 he spoke about the beast that's the first time the beast is mentioned in the book of revelation you go to revelation 13 there is two beasts one coming out of the water one coming out of the sea you go to revelation 17 you will see also a beast the beast that was which was and which to come which was which was to come there is always beast beast bishops today everybody okay brother branham say his call beast the same way but the beast there the interpretation is theron the greek word is tyralon which means a wild anthem beast because the serpent in the category was in the category of wild animal amen that's why every beast that he uses must be wild everybody okay brother branham say what an antenna beast but soon means a creature or a living creature what brother branham is saying is when you look at the living creature the four anointing one like a lion one like an ox one like a man one like a flying ego the word there is creature but if you go every time they say beast they are telling you it's a savage it's an animalistic world but the creature are not savage the living beings are not savage creature everybody okay he said the four living zone or creature not the best world the tyrion but the zun the living creature the therion is a wide and temp savage in other words if you watch revelation water it's the water we will get that down the road revelation 13 it's the water we will get there down the road the revelation 17 is buff water [Music] the beast at the beginning and they'll be stayed there everybody okay he said of denominational churches consolidated with catholicism make them water water their anointing cannot work you cannot unite them with the broth those are tribulation anointing they are term anointing that's why the bible says that the great dragon was caster that water called the water why is he called the devil while he was a beast he was called a devil because jordan was made flesh in ammon because the devil was made flesh into the serpent now the serpent becomes the devil now satan become the beast any question let's stand [Music] [Applause] i went nine minutes over i'm sorry i could not reach where i wanted to reach but i want you to get that the word subtility use wisdom daddy use wisdom mama use wisdom use wisdom use the word of god discern the spirit behind no matter what the name says even if the name say message of the hour the name say christian the name say bar jesus the son of jesus the son of god all those name watch the spirit behind because you can be fooled by the brother you can because more damage by a brother so-called message believer because you are you are fooled by the name message believer because you never look no matter if you are message believer we need to see your fruit i want to see the working in your life if your working is not lined up with the word no matter how beautiful they look no matter how smart and crafty that boy look stay away amen because if the devil already infiltrated their subtility they know the principle of life they know biology they know how to get around the woman they know what to do how did the serpent in one shot got him pregnant who taught him the circle of a woman because he has the maha he knew the principle of life he understood the sucker of eve eve was innocent she didn't know what she was doing the serpent was looking he said you're a small girl you don't understand yourself amen he knew he understood things better amen let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly tonight father once again thanking you for your grace for your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father these things are unfold for a purpose because your prophet told us that to overcome we must recognize the devil in all his tricks lord father david slept up did not understand did not even question why do you need your sister to come home if you would have stopped and think twice probably this damage could not be made but father we don't know we don't want to go like people to whom the wisdom of god was not expressed in the same time lord you broke the seals you unfolded the trace of the serpent you unfolded all the mystery of the antichrist and you want your children to be aware and to know clearly because eve did not know what we know today lord father the seventh seal in genesis was quiet all that they say was god rested in the seventh day it took the end time to break the seals and because of the locking of the seals for the humanity has been falling one after the other under the trap of the devil but further the center it's a different oil it's a separate oil it's a second oil load it's an oil that is opening your eyes off your children so that they can discern through everything the devil can bring and recognize the devil in his trick lord and not fall for what seems to be fleshy or good in the eyes father may you continue to minister to them and if anybody is sick tonight father lord we pray that you touch their body and may you heal them lord father may you remember the needs of your children in their life lord may you strengthen our elder who's here in the midst of us lord and father touch his body and give him more energy father we commit everything unto the hand may you give travel mercy to your children as they go into their respective place after the worship lord father be with us and keep everything lord under the blood in the name of jesus christ amen yes my brother god richly bless you we love you man amen amen what a wonderful word to as a man i want to take this song amen who i am lord amen if we can have that projected amen oh glorious victory that day he set me free and made my heart is very true my life is too long am i i'm a prisoner of love divine and now i lead [Music] set me free and made my heart is very true my life is [Music] who i am who i am lord who i am i can see [Music] is predestination of who i am who i am o who i am lord who [Music] part of this world it's a revelation predestination of who i am [Music] became my savior [Music] who i am lord o who i am [Music] a part of my savior
