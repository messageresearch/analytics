somebody pulled up something say well when you open the seventh seal do you open the six first and this and this then did you have that question too but somebody heard the question have a seat let's handle that [Laughter] and i'm gonna call the preacher amen you see how the holy ghost knows how to get people amen hallelujah god working six days right the first day was labor the second day labor the third the fourth the fifth and the sixth day in the sixth day he created man amen which was the top of creation and that was it you know the word god was moving if you want to evolution the true evolution this is it right here amen not the one from darwin that comes from hell everybody care so on the seventh day the bible say that god rested so if you go on the seventh day you will see god sitting just the way you're sitting there and you say what are you doing today say nothing why are you not doing anything because i'm resting why are you resting because i work and i label six days everybody so the seventh day it's a quiet day a day of refreshness the bible says in exodus i believe 17 or 31 17 that god reflect let's go to exodus 31. i'm going to take a few minutes quick so don't pull too hard before you turn into 30 minutes amen exodus chapter 31 verse 17. if you're there you can say amen you there let's go by verse 16. wherefore the children of israel shall keep water sabbath means what it means the rest shall keep the sabbath six days in the week you work on the seventh day khan why because somebody did it at the beginning amen wherefore the children of israel shall keep the sabbath to observe the sabbath throughout their generation for a perpetual covenant 17 it is a sign between me and the children of israel forever for in six days the lord made water heaven and earth and on the seventh day he did what arrested karma and did water so not only did god rested according to moses he also refreshed on the seventh day so the seventh day give you the resting and the refreshing everybody okay but this resting and the refreshing god expressed that to israel as a sabbath anybody okay no work no work for who work for god no work for who nobody work in israel but somebody was working do you know who was working the priest in the tabernacle everybody okay so when you're resting on the seventh day in the tabernacle inside there there is a priest working why are you resting anybody okay so this rest have a mystery of a priest still working anybody okay did i lose you okay praise god now when we come to the seal we have the first seal the second seal the third the fourth the fifth the six all the way to the seven the way we explain it to you you have the first seal the first row and the seals there right then the second one then the third then the fourth then the fifth then the six and then the seven which seal everything okay go to revelation 6. making me preach the seals now if you don't get it just relax down the road you're gonna get it amen revelation six chapter 1 i just don't want somebody to linger with a question moving on amen that's not good revelation 6 1 and i saw when the lamb opened how many one of the seals everybody care i heard as the word the noise of water everybody okay so far so when this first seal was broken it broke with a thunder anybody care so if this the breaking of the seal everybody okay if the breaking of the seal releases the thunder everybody here that means that the thunder is inside the seal anybody okay so if you have a package inside this package there is a thunder anybody here and the thunder is the voice of god anybody care and this standard is sealed by a seal anybody care it's like a balloon that is sealed everybody okay when you open the balloon what happened to the air it comes out everybody okay so when the of the break the seal this is what releases the thunder everybody okay so far go to revelation 10. you there very easy amen verse three you there and cry with a loud voice as when a lion aurorath and when he had cry how many thunders if we got seven thunders how many seals do we need if the seals were broken were the thunder reveal you have any more questions with the seven thunders so i already preached the seven thunders everybody okay and seven thunders ordered their voices verse four and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was about to write so the thunder was saying something everybody okay and that thing whatever they were saying could be written anybody okay i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me close up those things the voice say what it didn't say close the voice say what the voice say what say what the things that the thunder ordered everybody care so every seal got a thunder anybody okay and those thunder got the voices of certain instruction of god written not all that are locked in the ceiling anybody okay so when you break this seventh over here anybody care according to revelation seven um i mean according to revelation 10 anybody care how many thunders ordered seven right but we know the book was closed right in other words when you break the seventh seal everybody okay you don't only break one the seventh seal will break every other seal as in a sequence anybody okay that's why brother branham say i went for the blast and he blasted one two three four five six seven like they were spelling something everybody okay so they're breaking off the f of the seventh year doesn't happen in one seal only it goes one two three four five six seven that's why when the angel come down all seven are broken anybody here that's what produced the seven angels in the constellation because brother branham said every angel was a seal that's why they have seven of them meaning the seven thunders has been broken down anybody okay everybody okay now that the book is open now you can begin to read it then on the morning the angel come and tell brother branham let's go to the first seal i am that's hill i know what it means the first cell means this this this this this this and when brother brandon begin to look it is contrary to larkins larkin's got a little glance out there brother branham corrected larkins put me on record brother branham did not copy larkins he corrected larkins and he went even far beyond larkins everybody okay so far on the second day de angel come back again and when brother branham was preaching brother branham say those seven ninja were sitting there making sure that everything that is coming there is exactly perfectly line that's why brother branham said if i ever preach something everything from the seal is totally inspired everybody here brother branham wanted to even make a mistake on the pulpit and the angel anointed somebody and that person talked to brother branham said go ahead and read back again because there is no mistake to that anybody here so for you to have all of this open you need the seventh seal to open that's why brother branham said it was only one blast but seven angels came in other words seven thunders came and when they came they were you open the book then you can start chapter one chapter two chapter three chapter four because the book is open if it's only one seal you're not going to be able to read this so when it's weeping it's ripping the whole book of redemption all the way up and the book is open that's why when the angel came down he came with an open in other words all seals has been water anybody okay so when you go to revelation chapter 8 verse 1 the bible says when we open the seventy what happened nothing why silence somebody's there on the seventh seal he is the one that is coming to open amen why seven angels why seven seals how many spirit of god do we have which is one spirit manifested in water seven different times that's why when all of them gather together the head is who anybody care so this cloud is a great mystery this cloud is your message everybody here that's why brother branham said this cloud vindicate that the message is right everybody okay so far now let me ask you a question why do people always try to attack the cloud why is the devil mad about the cloud everybody here because the cloud is what i'll open the book of redemption and changes you completely amen so your rest is on the seventh day which is a sabbath everybody here the seventh seal which is your rest clear amen when you go in the tabernacle you don't have seven you got three everybody okay this is the other coat right this is the holy place right and this is the water where is the rest in the tabernacle if you ask the holiest why do you rest because god was doing work you went through the present altar you went to the liver you went to the table of the showbread you went through the candlestick you went through the basin to the altar of incense then you enter into rest anybody here you resting here the mystery of this rest is god has been working all along but when you enter the rest you don't do any more work you sit quiet you relax god take over your life and god handle it everybody okay so far did i lose anybody did i lose anybody everybody clear now praise god let's stand we got brother there award preaching for us tonight you know brother darrow that's a body amen wonderful ministry he preached for us before we know him for a long time he has a wonderful ministry praying a lot for the sick amen i told him i said brother there are you homer so you preach like home and i'm gonna add behave like home and be free like home amen so you know what to do pull on the gift of god and you're going to receive a blessing tonight let's go lord i believe lord i believe [Music] lord i believe all things are possible lord i believe hallelujah [Music] oh [Music] hallelujah praise the lord i'm so happy we know what to believe amen the world uh living in such a time of confusion and uncertainty people don't even know what to believe they don't know whether the news is right or wrong but i'm so glad that we've got the good news amen amen vindicated by a pillar of fire an evening light message to turn our hearts back amen to the faith of the fathers amen for what not to make another organization not for but to go home hallelujah amen this this message will produce a body change amen amen you know a lot of people want to change their body but i'm glad i'm glad that we've got the real body change amen praise the lord we greet you in the name of the lord jesus and kind of such an honor to be with you this evening and if you have your bibles turn with us to the book of first samuel we want to read from first samuel chapter 17 starting at verse four to bring you greetings from my pastor brother donnie reagan and the folks are at happy valley and we just counted an honor to be with you this evening amen praise god just a little simple evangelistic thought it's really the only kind i can preach i trust to be a blessing to you the bible says this and there went out a champion out of the camp of the philistines named goliath of gate whose height was six cubics and a span and he had a helmet of brass upon his head and he was armed with a coat of mail and the weight of the coat was 5 000 shackles of brass which is about 78 pounds and he had graves of brass upon his legs and a target of brass between his shoulders and the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam and his spearhead weighed 600 shekels of iron and one bearing a shield went before him and he stood and cried into the armies of israel and said unto them why are you come out to set your battle in a ray am not i a philistine and ye servants to saul choose you a man for you and let him come down to me and if he be able to fight with me and to kill me then we will be your servants but if i prevail against him and kill him then shall ye be our servants and serve us and the philistines said i defy the armies of israel which that word means curse i curse the armies of israel this day that was the wrong thing for him to say give me a man that we may fight together and when saul and all israel heard those words of the philistine they were dismayed and greatly afraid my my the army of god afraid let us bow our heads i want to speak to you for a few minutes this evening on why i believe david won heavenly father thy word is true i give this congregation and myself into your hands for your glory in jesus name amen god bless you saints you may be seated of course in our scripture reading this evening it's very very familiar to all of us and no doubt we've heard it from the time we just wee little things and sunday school teachers just taught us about the story of david and goliath but you know no matter how many times we've heard it it's still just as true david was just a boy facing a giant he was facing opposition much stronger than him much bigger than him and yet he overcame his enemy you see every time the devil produces a goliath god has gone to david somewhere the prophet said always remember that every time there is a goliath god produces a david hallelujah god produces a david and let me say in this day of goliaths a goliath of cancer and goliaths of pandemics and goliaths of evil and critics i woke the devil to know the night that there is a david who will meet the challenge of this hour amen god has always had a david and he's got him today now if you look at human reasoning goliath should have won this battle he was tall david was short he was the warrior david was a shepherd goliath was covered in armor his male coat weighed 78 pounds goliath was covered in armor david was covered in sheepskin who do you think vegas would have voted for who would have vegas put their money on what would have been the odds that vegas would have gave against this battle but you see why is that because the world looks at the natural part they look at what they can see with the eye how could this woman walk how could this man ever get up out of a wheelchair how could this man fixing the dive of heart disease get over it and be made well how can that be how can a little girl blinded in a train accident how can her eyes come open it's unreasonable but you cannot reason it out [Music] god isn't known by reasoning god is known by faith amen you see satan leads a man but what he sees with his eyes but god chose to lead man by his heart the eyes of the heart sees the unseen amen david had a sling goliath had a challenge oh hallelujah but david had a god who could not be defeated and let me say tonight that david's god is my god and there is no god like my god hallelujah [Applause] i said there is no god like our god hallelujah amen now the setting of this showdown was a valley between two hills on one hill was the philistines who served gods and on the other hill was the army of jehovah the army of israel they were trained they were armed they were god's army then why were they afraid [Music] they were the army of god and it came to pass that the philistine army had this challenger a big champion by the name of goliath he was nine foot and four inches tall he had 14 inch fingers from the back of his hand to the end of his fingers was 28 inches long [Music] he could smack you on one side to face and smack you on the other at the same time when you were smacked by goliath you had been smacked amen you see somebody walking with both sides of the cheeks red you can say goliath slap that boy right there he was a giant [Music] and he come out and he made a boast he said they don't need all these armies of suffering loss they don't need everybody sweating and getting all bruised up and just send me out of man you see how the devil is when he thinks he's got you on the edge he can see oh my when he thinks he's got the upper hand that's what he really likes to boast that's when he really likes to poke it into you possibly if he can and then i said let's have it like this send me out a man who'll fight me goliath wanted a man but god gave him a boy oh hallelujah that's my god amen god can take a boy and whoop a giant you see god don't need something big he just needs something yielded if anybody in the whole army of israel should have been able to fight this giant it was saul the bible said he was head and shoulders above every man in his army he was closer to goliath size than any other man in the army the prophet said he knew how to fight he knew how to maneuver a spear he knew how to raise the shield he knew how to knock a lick off he he knew how to train men he was a bishop he knew what he was doing but you see god never chose saul god chose david and if god has chosen you to do something they ain't nobody can take your place [Applause] well i'm just a housewife i'm just a painter i'm just this i'm just that but if god has chosen you for this hour there is nobody that can take your place hallelujah amen god didn't choose us to lose god didn't choose us to be defeated god didn't choose us just to survive but god chose us as overcomers amen they were an army god's army [Music] trained equipped they had tapes and books and pictures and belt buckles but the bible said that when they heard this boast they were dismayed and greatly afraid how could that be because they lacked something that david had listen to me it's not just enough i was in the backfield the other day praying and i was praying for the young people i just had a burden for them and i felt like the lord spoke to me and said go ask them are they just in the message or is the message in them it's not enough just to come to a message church it's not enough just the center of the pictures of a prophet but you must be born again the life of god must be in us amen what did david have he had an experience you'll never know god by education you'll never know god by reasoning out but god is known by experience amen they failed to see who they were in the word [Music] listen the devil don't care if we come and sit here on these pews if we don't know who we are if one day we're bribed and the next day we're not one day we're on fire the next day we're not you don't care if you sit here as long as you've got amnesia you see somebody with amnesia they're pitiful they don't know who they are [Music] and if the devil can keep you confused that's all he wants to do he always puts that little doubt [Music] he even used it against our lord he said if thou be if satan never denied the word he just tried to get jesus thinking maybe that's not him but jesus had perfect faith because he knew who he was in the word that army they lacked what joshua and caleb had what did they have they had a revelation amen what is faith faith is a revelation [Music] think about it these spies left they all went to the same church follow the same prophet was under the same message and they go over to spy off the land that god gave them he had already gave them the land god ain't no indian giver he don't give something and then take it back and ten of them came back and you know what they said we can't do it man there's jots over there they got walled cities it's just too much it's just too hard we can't do it and how fast the bible said that that night that they was weeping and wailing in the whole camp of israel how fast a negative report can spread through a church but there was two in the congregation who did not look to the giants amen they did not look to the walled cities they looked to the promise of god and they said we're more than able to do it gabe stood there with the revelation and he said give me my mountain amen god promised we could do it god said we could do it amen don't look at the walled cities we're not interested in the giants quit looking at the giant start looking at god's word but you see the devil always wants us to get our eyes off the word and look at the giants as long as your eyes sees the size of the giant that's all you'll ever see but god help us not to let situations and circumstances play on our emotions so many people are driven by emotion well i got prayed for i must have got it because i got a goosebump you can't base it on a goosebump you could get a goosebump off the air conditioner [Music] well i went up there got prayed for i didn't feel nothing what's that got to do with it he never said did you feel it but he did say did you believe it if thousand believe all things are impossible well brother daryl you against the motion no i'm not against the motion it's got its place but the word has the preeminence over everything amen we don't serve god by emotion we serve god by faith if you serve god by how you feel the devil will make sure you never feel good but the prophet said when men and women quit looking at their sickness and their disease and start looking to what god said about it you will take over [Music] how many believes all things are subject to jesus christ absolutely but here's the rest of the quote [Music] all things are subject to jesus christ and which is conjunction means something else and all things are subject to you in prayer when you ask in his name is all things subject to christ absolutely but all things are subject to you when you ask in his name there is power in the name of jesus [Music] he said ask what you will in my name and it will be done whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe you receive it and you shall have it god said so god said so let nothing stand in your way stop looking at the things you're looking at here look at the unseen god said we could do it look god gave moses a stick god gave shamgard an ox goat god gave samson a jawbone but god gave us his name [Music] [Applause] every man today knows he can take the name of jesus christ and meet any foe any place anytime and he will be defeated i've met witch doctors i've met demons of all sorts and never seen a time but what they bowed to the name of jesus when you speak the name jesus you are speaking an excellent word at the name of jesus dead babies sleep in the mother's womb at the name of jesus blinded eyes come open at the name of jesus the lame get up and walk amen oh hallelujah the prophet said i tell you friends when the church lost the name and the power of the name of jesus christ they lost it [Music] that first church they baptized in the name of jesus prayed in the name of jesus preached in the name of jesus took communion in the name of jesus so what what was the first thing satan done when he attacked the church he took the name of jesus out and gave them titles when you are baptized in titles you are baptized under a catholic doctrine and what did it through the dark ages they lost that name and they served him under titles and trinitarianism but what has god done for us in the last day he sent a prophet to do what restored the name of jesus to the church and he said i no longer call you church but i call you mistress jesus christ for the god that was in christ is now in his people making him the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah the prophet said when moses went down to egypt if they could have ever got that stick out of his hand they had him whipped but in that stick was where the power laid if they ever got the stick out of his hand they had he whipped it was the stick that smoked the rock it was a stick that he held into the air it was the stinky held over the waters it was god's judgment rod and what the stick was in moses hand the name of jesus christ is to the born again church today lord take the name of jesus with you child of sorrow in the world when temptation round you gathers breathe that holy name and prayer we meet our giants in the name of jesus david said you meet me as a philistine with armor and spear but i meet you in the name of the lord god of israel in the name of the lord god of israel and the prophet said the jesus of the new testament is jehovah of the old he only changed his mask from spirit to man he changed his mass from a spirit to a man called the bridegroom now he's changed his mask again [Applause] [Music] to a bride [Applause] and the same word speaks for the groom speaks also for the bride she's bound of his bone flesh of his flesh spirit of his spirit life of his life she is him expressed on the earth david knew where he was standing david knew how to meet that giant and i say tonight we know how to meet our goliaths in the name of jesus [Music] amen david picked up five stones j-e-s-u-s f-a-i-t-h five stones with five fingers faith in jesus and here he comes something has to happen when you come to meet your giant with faith in jesus [Music] [Applause] when he turned loose of that stone the spirit of god caught it and that stone slew goliath david cut his head off and when the philistines saw their champion laying there without a head they begin to run [Music] and the army of israel took courage and they cut the philistines pumped to the wall that's what it means tonight somebody who's got an experience to stand up and prove the power of the resurrection of jesus christ and the rest of them will take courage oh what we need in this congregation is a david hallelujah who will step out and meet the challenge of the hour amen the prophet said try it once and watch the group follow you somebody to take courage and thank god at his word how's down in oklahoma uh last year i believe it was i believe it was last year and there was a sister there and right at the end of the service she had a tennis elbow anybody ever had that it's painful you put that thing right there to kind of relax that tendon and it's so painful you can't clap but right at the end of the service the sister was standing there and she clapped her hands and she began to yell i'm healed i'm healed she said i couldn't do that but now i'm doing it i'm healed and when she's it's like the door opened when she proclaimed her healing others began to step through the open door this one was healed of arthritis in the neck this one was healed of a tumor on their leg why somebody took courage and drove the enemy to the cutting wall i tell you there's enough of us here tonight to drive every devil out of gastonia oh david do you hear me tonight the reason i believe david wood when david went to meet goliath god looked at him and laughed said am i a dog that you'd come out to meet me like that a little looking boy the prophet said he was a ruddy fella saul called him a stripley that's what saul said about it who is this little stripping out there just a little old kid you know little that probably said looking fella probably shoulders all stooped over goliath's armor probably weighed more than david did and ain't it something that saul and goliath agreed over david's qualifications saul said am i a dog did you send out this ruddy looking fella and saul said who is this who is the stripper what's his qualifications oh friends never take sides with the devil against your brother amen don't look at the size it's all i remember several years ago i was going out to preach and i went down to the barn to feed the horse when i got down there there was this little dog strange looking dog that kind of growled at me i got bit as a boy i've always been just a wee bit scared of dogs so i go back up to the house and i tell my wife i said honey there's a dog down at the barn you all be careful when i get home we'll try to find its owner i said just kind of watch them around the girls now we had an australian shepherd we called duchess when i came back from the meeting that little dog was on the couch and they named it they said can we keep it daddy i said oh no we'll feed it we'll take care of it but we will find its owner so they come us a little snow and the kids went out the sleigh rod and they put duchess up in the sled and they started off the hill here come this little dog after the sled just duchess jumped off the sled there's a fight broke out and i started screaming duchess don't kill the dog it's not ours but it wasn't long at all brochure that i was yelling little fella don't kill my dog and the prophet said it's not the size of the dog that's in the fight but it's the size of the fight that's in the dog oh don't let your qualifications be undermined well i'm not a pastor i'm not an evangelist i'm not a prophet be what god made you he will use you the way he wants to use you [Music] saul said now if you if i can't if i can't talk you into sitting down here you take my armor it's the best of the best i'm the leader around here i've got the best spear best helmet best shield i've got the best armor of anybody well if it's so good saul why don't you use it [Music] and so he tried to put all this on david david said i can't use this it's not been proven to me well you've got to hear my tape you've got to hear my no i'll just stay with what the prophet said amen just stay with what the tape said he never said play what i say he said say what i say [Music] david said i can't use that it don't fit take it off of me let me go with what i know about oh my that's it tonight you don't have to have a great big education to know a whole lot of things the only thing we need to know is the power of the resurrected jesus christ let me go with that amen the power that saved me from sin that killed me from sickness that's all i have to know abraham i know he opens blinded eyes i know he makes the lame walk i see it every day of my life when my daughter walks down the stairs to get something out of the cabinet i know my god opens blinded eyes i know my god makes the lame walk i'll just stay with what i've experienced amen know him in the power of his resurrection be a witness to him i am a witness amen he crossed over that little bridge he reached down and picked up five smooth stones now he didn't get five stones in case he missed four times he got five stones because goliath had four brothers and david said i'll kill them all if i have to i'll take care of the whole family or saints of god that's who we are tonight the prophet of god said god's method is to cast out evil cast down reasoning cast down superstition cast down weariness castile disease cast down sin hey man you're above it resurrected in christ jesus set it in heavenly places with every devil somebody say every devil with every devil under your feet oh hallelujah david wasn't afraid of goliath and he wasn't afraid of his brothers i'm not afraid of the devil or his army amen for the prophet said every devil is under our feet years ago i was preaching up in kentucky my youngest daughter allison is just a wee little thing and we're standing outside after the service talking and allison she's standing beside me and she goes i that up for what in the world so i said something else to the brother she goes i said something else to the brother she goes [Music] this time she had her tongue stuck out i said awesome what are you doing she said it's a bug daddy it's a bug and i look down on they said she was trying to stomp on that bug oh the devil that suffers he ain't nothing but a bug all you need is somebody who'll stomp on his head amen who'll put him in his place oh well the devil said this and the devil said that you need to tell the devil a few things you need to tell him where he come from you need to tell him where he's going we need to tell him that his backbone is broken you need to tell him that he's a defeated being you need to tell him he's nothing but a bluff you need to tell him that hell was created for him it was not made for me it was made for him and his angels when the devil tries to remind you of your past you tell him his future [Music] goliath walked out there said we had a man [Music] who are you david said i'm the last thing you'll ever see [Applause] glasses am i a dog david said bow wow [Applause] here he come with his sling it wasn't a sling it wasn't the rock he knew god amen why i believe david won not because he's a good marksmanship but because he knew god and he knew who he was he was a believer he was elected he was called he was anointed he was placed no matter whether you're young or old tall or short if god has called you for such a time as this you are undefeatable well if we had 500 we don't need 500 we just need one when you realize that god has revealed the truth of this thing to you there's nothing in this world that's going to defeat you in it you're absolutely undefeatable [Music] not you but the god that's in you look friends this right here ain't no match for no devil my it ain't no match for no devil i tell you right now i am not the sharpest knife in the drawer it's not this it's not my intellect but it's the god that's in me it's the god that's in you the prophet said not you but the god that's in you not christ not the body not the man christ but the word that was in him not mary but the word that was born from her they couldn't understand it why that little boy wasn't afraid why that little boy could run after and say this day i'll take your head off they couldn't understand how could he be so bold how could he be so confident [Music] [Applause] he knew where he was at he knew where he was standing goliath made his boast but that's all he had was a boast david had a god that could not be defeated [Music] well god used to do it when brother brennan was here but he don't do it no more that's a lie that's not true if he don't do it no more he's not the same the bible said he's the same yesterday today and forever [Music] it might be the miracles might have been over for the army who didn't know who they were didn't know what they what their position was but not for david he was anointed he knew he was positionally placed in the body he knew where he was at and every david setting here tonight you're positionally in christ god has confirmed it election calling anointing placing he elected you called you anointed place him then he anointed you with the holy spirit and now he's placed you in the body of christ each one of these davids said where is the goliath who's the goliath it's that cancer that's eating you up it's that tumor that's hanging on you it's them cataracts on your eyes it's that arm that everything looks at it and says it cannot be done the devil says you might as well quit believing you might as well settle down you ain't no more going to get well your doctor said so all the rest of them said so the mri said so the ct scan said so the pet scan said so so well my doctor said that my doctor said my doctors look i'm not against doctors i go to doctors don't you go to doctors people put so much faith in what the doctor said but just remember out of 100 doctors that graduate somebody graduated last in their class and it might be your doctor i'm telling you the truth [Applause] the only reason he got his degree because his daddy was the professor [Music] now ask me how i know that i worked with them i worked 18 years in surgery i know a lot about doctors [Music] but i'm not against that but when the doctor said she'll never see again i said sir i've got another doctor by the name of dr jesus and he said he hath anointed me to open the eyes of the blood that's where the anointing lays that's where my faith lays that's where our hope is in christ alone [Applause] the doctor says you can't be healed but god says you're already healed and i say to you whose report will you believe we shall believe the report of the the lord that made us stop drinking that made us stop smoking and lying and stealing that saved us from a life of drunkenness and rowing us from sin and the devil's grave if god can do that for me cannot he save me from cancer can not he heal me from tb cannot he take the arthritis from my body cannot he find my wayward son get out of here find my daughter and bring her back cannot my god do everything. oh glory to god [Music] don't take that boast off that goliath don't take his boats stand your ground you're a child of god you're a son of god you're a daughter of god called chosen elected anointed positionally placed with every devil under our feet challenge him to a showdown god loves showdowns hallelujah god loves to be took at his word we ask god for big things because we believe he's a big god [Applause] [Music] if every believer knew his position in heaven god's great spirit is here and the holy ghost is ready to fall on anybody that'll believe him do you believe that tonight if thou can believe the promise is unto you and to your children even as far off as many as the lord our god shall call election calling anointing placing he elected you brother you've already read that i know i'm going to read it again he elected you and he called you he elected you and called you then he anointed you with the holy spirit and has placed you in his body each one of these davids who is the david of 2022 who is the david of today i'm here to tell you it's you [Applause] well i'm young so is david well i'm small so is david well i ain't got no education neither did david that's got nothing to do with it it wasn't david's ability anyway it was the god david served david stood out there and faced that giant knowing he was anointed by a prophet god is in his word god confirms his word and god keeps his word and god had come to david by a prophet and anointed him and told him things that are to be sound familiar does it sound familiar god sent a prophet to david to tell him who you are where you come from where you're going and he anointed him to meet the challenge of the hour we're on orphans we're not cast away we're not a caulk we are anointed to meet the challenge of 2022. [Music] david was satisfied with the prophet's message he was satisfied with what the prophet had told him when he poured the anointing all upon him a prophet has stood in this generation and has prophesied over you [Music] the things the prophet said would happen we're no longer reading about them we're living them we have become the vision [Music] [Applause] [Music] the word of god was on him the word of god was on david placed there by a prophet anointed by a prophet's message david you will reign as a king [Applause] did not he say that we are kings and priests [Applause] david you're anointed a king david said how can i die by a giant and reign his king it reminds me of paul when he was shipping his prophesied over paul you must go to rome and he put him on a ship and chains and a big storm comes up 14 days you talk about a storm i think 10 days it didn't even eat and men tried to act like they was letting down anchors but they was trying to let down little boats but the angel told paul tell them abide with the ship or perish these people walk away from this message trying to let it down under color well i've just got a few questions i better tell you like paul said you better cut that thing off you better let it fall into the sea stay with the ship the waves broke that ship up and what did they do they took pieces of the ship and it carried them to land and paul got on the shore being the messenger he was a servant to the people you see people get it wrong the bride is not a servant to the ministry but the ministry is a servant to the bride i am your servant and paul goes out and he picks up sticks and the stick was a snake in the sticks was a snake it might have been a a a a a mom bear is that how you say yeah whatever it was you had just a few breaths after he was built and when that snake bit paul the people you know what they said they said this man must have done something awful he survived those storms he survived the shipwreck he got on shore to be bit by the snake the snake was so poisoned they just sat down to watch him die they didn't even call 911. so they just sat down to watch him die i think i preached in that church one time [Applause] [Applause] [Music] that snake bit him on the arm paul looked at it shook it over into the fire and when he didn't die they said he was a god but you see paul took the word of the lord over the snakebite when that venom started crawling up oh that'd be a good message to preach when venom met faith [Applause] when that poison was going up his arm all of a sudden it met the faith that said you must go to rome oh my and the faith annihilated the venom oh don't worry about the snake bout we've got a word from the lord amen we're not going to rome we're going to heaven [Music] paul said how how can i die from a snakebite and go to rome so he took the word over the snakebite and david took the prophet's word over the globs boast [Music] he knew that's he what he was told but that's the reason he wasn't rattled where the people are absolutely scared to death i was at the bank the other day i saw two people in a car with the windows rolled up both of them had on masks scared to death i told my wife i said either they're afraid of coving or they're fixing to rob the bank one of the other the world is gripped in fear but david wasn't afraid you see the rest of them saw a giant oh going to god but david saw a target that was too big to miss it wasn't the sling that he had in his hand that killed goliath it wasn't the stone that he helped in his pocket that did it it was a hidden power you mean brother daryl you mean if we had that hidden power we could do what david did [Music] it was the hidden power that blessing of god that was upon davidson he that receives a prophet in the name of the prophet receives every prophet's reward [Applause] that blessing of god that was upon david when he let loose of that stone when he let loose of what he had when you let loose of what you've got [Music] god took it and blessed it with a hidden power it wasn't david it wasn't the stone it wasn't the slingshot it was that blessing that was on david that slew the enemy of david and david of today you have a hidden power well brother daryl if i had that hidden power i've come to tell you if you've got the holy ghost you've got it the prophet said david of today you have a hidden power the anointing of the holy ghost as david was anointed to meet his job so are we anointed to meet ours every man woman boy and girl that wants to go on with god don't pay any attention to what the world says whether we can or whether we can god promised it god said we could do it and that settles it god said there'd be a third pool god said limbs would be restored god said the dead would be raised god said there'll be a body change god said there'll be a rapture [Applause] god said it and he would never say it if he couldn't do it [Applause] amen hallelujah what we need in this hour his men and women to take the challenge to take the promise of god before the people god promised to pour us out a pentecostal blessing in the last days i mean a real pentecostal pour out a cadis barnea has arrived someone who could say we can do it we can do it we can cast out devils we can lay our hands on the sick and they shall recover we can preach the gospel with boldness we can live an overcoming life why because he lives in us [Applause] do you love him that same holy spirit that was upon christ was his mantle that god gave him the anointing of the holy spirit was his mantle he sent it into the hands of the father and then my into thy hands i commend my spirit and what happened on the day of pentecost god sent the mantle back down and the church was clothed with the same anointing that he had they went up at pentecost and waited in the upper room jesus which was the antitype of elijah was taken up from death and resurrected and he sent back the mantle the same holy spirit that was upon him fell upon the church there's not two holy ghosts there's only one holy ghost it is that hidden power that every believer possesses to meet the giants hey listen to me we slay our giants one at a time [Music] the same holy spirit that was upon him fell on the church he said the things that i do shall you do also and greater than this shall you do a double portion when elijah time to go home he went down to the river elisha was following him do you know how many years elisha followed elijah 10 years during that 10 years god never cut the mantle to fit elisha but he cut and molded elisha to fit the mantle and god will never cut this message to fit our opinions but he will mold us and shape us until we fit the mantle [Music] and he walks down and noticed when they got to the river what was there critics sound familiar didn't see too many of when brother branham was here but now 70 years later all of a sudden we have these critics who want to challenge the message and the authority of the pillar of fire so there at the river was the critics but elijah took the mantle and he struck the water and the water parted and they went over and it closed behind them now they're in a secret place just elijah and elisha jesus and his brother [Music] and elijah said what do you want [Music] what are you wanting i said what do you want he said i want a double portion of your spirit notice he never asked for another spirit i want the same spirit just more of it like the guy eating watermelon he said that's good there got to be more somewhere and elijah said you've asked a hard thing but if you see me when i go you can have what you asked for now what did it cause it caused a singleness of heart a singleness of mind a singleness of eye he had to keep his eye on the promise don't look at the giant look at the promise don't look at the sickness look at the promise and a chair of the fire came down elijah stepped over in it and he went up and elijah said you promised you see the prophet of god said god likes for you to remind him of his word [Applause] you promised if i see you go down out of heaven [Applause] elisha goes over and he picks up the medal he goes back down to the same river with the same mantle with the same anointing with the same god at the same river in front of the same critics and he stuck the water he said where is the god of elijah and the water parted jesus said the things i do shall you do also [Applause] slay your giant slay your giant david [Applause] jesus sent the medal back on the day of pentecost and the church picked it up but what did god say he would do in the last days i will restore [Music] same god same anointing same word same manner notice when ruth laid at the feet of boaz she pulled boaz as the bible said his skirt [Music] which is his wing she came under his wing can i have just a couple of men do you know since this war in ukraine bomb shelters the the selling of bomb shelters has

bomb shelter his is built out of feathers we are under his wings when ruth laid at the foot of boaz she pulled his skirt over her she was covered with the same garment boaz was covered with [Applause] [Music] and he gave her that next morning he gave her six measures of pure barley but notice there's seven days in a week why why did he only give her six because of the seventh day she got the lord
