Amen. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Let's take you can you may take your Bible. Let's go to the book of Colossians chapter 1. Can you hear me? Okay. &gt;&gt; Beginning by the 90th verse. For he pleased the Father, that in him should all fullness dwell. And having made peace through the blood of his cross by him, to reconcile all things unto himself by him, I say, whether they be things in earth or things in heaven, are made peace through the blood of his cross. And you that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works and by wicked works. Yet now has he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight. If you continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not move away from the hope of the gospel, which he have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven, whereof I, Paul, I am made a minister, who now rejoice in my suffering, for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for the body for his body's sake which is the church whereof I made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill The word of God, &gt;&gt; even the mystery which has been heed from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints. to whom God will make known which is what is the riches of the glory to this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus where unto I also labor striving according to his working which workketh in me might modily &gt;&gt; let's go to Roman chapter 8 beginning by verse heavenity because the conom mind is enmity against God. For it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God. But ye You are not in the flesh, &gt;&gt; but in the spirit. &gt;&gt; If so be that the spirit of God dwell in you. Now if a man have not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his. And if Christ be in you, the body truly is dead because of sin. But the spirit is life, because of righteousness. But if the spirit of him that raise up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, &gt;&gt; he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you. Therefore, brethren, we are not debtor not to the flesh &gt;&gt; to live after the flesh. For if you live after the flesh, you shall die. But if ye through the spirit do modify the deeds of the body, you shall live. For as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. For ye have not received a spirit of bondage again to feel, but you have received the spirit of adoption. whereby we cry aba father. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. &gt;&gt; Heavenly father, &gt;&gt; bless this church. &gt;&gt; Bless brother Steven. &gt;&gt; Bless me. &gt;&gt; Bless every believer. Glory. Glory, praise, honor unto you in the name of Jesus Christ. We pray for your glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated tonight. &gt;&gt; I just have a brief message tonight. Christ in you. Make you the complete revelation of the whole thing. May God bless brother Steven Sheambo. You must believe him with all your heart. This is very very crucial &gt;&gt; because a pastor, &gt;&gt; he represented God for his church. &gt;&gt; He represent God for you. And you must believe it. No matter. You must believe it. You must respect it. You must honor him. If you do it that way, God will bless you. Not there is not demon in hell &gt;&gt; that can stand before an anointed man of God. &gt;&gt; When I'm in Ivory Coast in a when I finish preaching in my church automatically I connect to this church and I follow the sermon and I will invite him invite him to come down to Africa. and he will come to preach to us. &gt;&gt; If you believe it, say amen. &gt;&gt; Can I hear an amen? &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says &gt;&gt; in the deity of Jesus Christ in paragraph 82, &gt;&gt; he said, "Brothers and sisters, that deity is in you. &gt;&gt; Just a little while &gt;&gt; and the world will see me no more. But you &gt;&gt; you shall see me &gt;&gt; I will be with you. &gt;&gt; Even in you &gt;&gt; till the end of the world. &gt;&gt; Christ in a manger. No. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Christ in you. &gt;&gt; Christ in you. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; The hope of life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The creator &gt;&gt; himself living in a human being. &gt;&gt; The creator living in a human being. &gt;&gt; If you believe it, &gt;&gt; say amen. &gt;&gt; I want to hear an amen. &gt;&gt; You You cannot cry. &gt;&gt; You cannot shout. &gt;&gt; Just speak the word, &gt;&gt; God. God &gt;&gt; will confirm your word. &gt;&gt; The word of God &gt;&gt; in your life. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; What we will be. &gt;&gt; It's not truly manifested yet. But we will see him as he is &gt;&gt; because we will be like him. the spirit &gt;&gt; in a human body. &gt;&gt; When God created Adam, &gt;&gt; he said, "Let's make manage &gt;&gt; in our own image." &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham say, &gt;&gt; man in his image. &gt;&gt; It's the seven virtues Jesus &gt;&gt; took, &gt;&gt; Peter, &gt;&gt; John, &gt;&gt; and James. And he took them to Mount Transfiguration. And when he came back back from the mountain, &gt;&gt; he asked them a question, &gt;&gt; who do you say that I am? &gt;&gt; And Peter say, &gt;&gt; "You are the Christ, the son of the living God." And Jesus say, &gt;&gt; "I will build my church." &gt;&gt; I want to hear an amen. You cannot cry in your life. &gt;&gt; You cannot lament in your life. &gt;&gt; No matter your problem, &gt;&gt; just speak the word, &gt;&gt; it will happen. &gt;&gt; Who will do it? &gt;&gt; Who will do it for you? Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; the word of God that is in your life. &gt;&gt; Even if you are sick now, &gt;&gt; just speak the word. &gt;&gt; The things will happen, even if you don't have a job. &gt;&gt; Speak the word. &gt;&gt; It will happen. &gt;&gt; It will happen. Brother says this, &gt;&gt; Christ is the mystery of God revealed. &gt;&gt; 233. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say look &gt;&gt; Christ in you. He makes him the center of life of the revelation. You see &gt;&gt; Christ life in you in you makes him the center of the revelation. &gt;&gt; Christ in the Bible makes the Bible &gt;&gt; the complete revelation of Christ. &gt;&gt; Now Christ in you &gt;&gt; Christ in you. &gt;&gt; Christ in you. &gt;&gt; I didn't hear an amen. &gt;&gt; Christ in you. Not in the Bible. makes you &gt;&gt; makes you &gt;&gt; a complete &gt;&gt; revelation &gt;&gt; of the whole thing &gt;&gt; of the whole thing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Christ in you &gt;&gt; make you &gt;&gt; the complete &gt;&gt; revelation &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You cannot feel. You cannot be afraid. &gt;&gt; You cannot cry. &gt;&gt; Speak the word. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; He will accomplish it. &gt;&gt; I'm standing here. &gt;&gt; No matter your sickness. &gt;&gt; Oh, confess that I'm healed. &gt;&gt; I am healed. &gt;&gt; I am healed. No matter your sickness, &gt;&gt; just speak the word. &gt;&gt; Just speak the word. &gt;&gt; It will happen. &gt;&gt; It will happen. &gt;&gt; I don't I can't hear an amen. &gt;&gt; When you say amen, &gt;&gt; you are healed. &gt;&gt; You are healed. &gt;&gt; You are redeemed.

[Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Always Christ. &gt;&gt; Christ is the mystery of God revealed. &gt;&gt; Christ is the mystery of God revealed. &gt;&gt; 234. &gt;&gt; What is the new birth then? Well, brother, &gt;&gt; what is the new birth? &gt;&gt; It is the revelation &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; personally to you, &gt;&gt; personally to you, God himself reveal himself to you reveal himself to you personally &gt;&gt; and your life change. Your life changed &gt;&gt; and you will never cry. &gt;&gt; No matter the problem, &gt;&gt; you will just speak the word. &gt;&gt; Elijah, &gt;&gt; Elijah &gt;&gt; spoke the word. Moses &gt;&gt; spoke the word. &gt;&gt; Joshua said, &gt;&gt; Sam, stand still. And now you &gt;&gt; you can do it. &gt;&gt; You you can do it. &gt;&gt; I don't hear your amen. &gt;&gt; Christ in the Bible. He's the word &gt;&gt; that was revealed. [Applause] Nobody &gt;&gt; what somebody said about you the word &gt;&gt; was already revealed. &gt;&gt; Brother Steven, &gt;&gt; brother Steven Sheambo, &gt;&gt; he's preaching the word, &gt;&gt; he's preaching the word. There is not enough demon here that can stand, no demon, not sickness.
