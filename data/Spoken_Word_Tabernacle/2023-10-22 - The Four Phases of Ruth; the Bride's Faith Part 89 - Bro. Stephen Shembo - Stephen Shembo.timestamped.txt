[22:21] glory is your testimony like a praise
[22:23] report
[22:24] brother let's go ahead and we'll um
[22:27] y'all going be seated a moment brother
[22:30] DM has a um testimony this morning
[22:35] amen right I'll keep it short I want to
[22:39] thank God because if y'all know there
[22:41] was a pastor lost her daughter a few I
[22:44] guess weeks ago my dad went over there
[22:46] to um you know for the for the burial
[22:50] whatever and a lot of people went and I
[22:52] prayed for them and when my dad went
[22:56] directly after he left I felt stressed
[22:58] out on Friday I felt um stressed out but
[23:02] on Saturday I felt the most stressful
[23:04] because my dad wasn't there and
[23:05] everything and I had to look after my
[23:07] siblings I guess so throughout the whole
[23:10] entire day I was stressed out until the
[23:13] evening when I had to go pick him up and
[23:15] my mom was like why don't you call Uber
[23:16] to come pick him up I remember I called
[23:18] Uber yesterday to pick up my um brother
[23:21] but the dude ended up canceling because
[23:24] he couldn't find it so I decided to go
[23:27] and my dad was taking his I mean he
[23:30] wasn't taking his time but it was taking
[23:31] a while for him to come out and I was
[23:33] like I wish I was there so I can guide
[23:35] him to come out faster so he can go so
[23:38] since I wasn't there I started praying
[23:39] in my heart I was like God since you're
[23:40] there with him guide him so he can come
[23:42] we can go because they didn't want me to
[23:44] stay at the um arrival part too long so
[23:48] when he came I didn't see him he said
[23:50] that he was like in the first pole I was
[23:52] all the way in the fourth then as he
[23:54] kept walking I was waiting I was still
[23:55] looking back then when I saw him I felt
[23:57] kind of like Rel
[23:58] and I wasn't stressed anymore so I want
[24:00] to thank God for give him um safe
[24:04] traveling because there was also a girl
[24:06] who tried to delay his fight but thanks
[24:09] to God he made it one more time and is
[24:11] here today so I want to thank God for
[24:20] that
[24:22] amen I have a card here from the um kodo

[54:54] question and question question and we
[54:56] had to just catch up on the second one
[54:58] and I I I really uh preferred if the
[55:03] whole church was there because we deal
[55:05] with marriages between tribes and
[55:08] between nations and between different
[55:11] countries and things like that and we
[55:13] had to review the mixed marriage and the
[55:15] hybrid because there is a an
[55:17] intellectual teaching that is trying to
[55:19] contradict brother Bram and it has been
[55:22] introduced in the message and some of
[55:24] them are coming from even ministers in
[55:26] the message trying to contradict brother
[55:28] brandham when he's explaining
[55:30] hybridation of human beings brother Bram
[55:33] is correct amen I took the scripture I
[55:37] took the message of the hour and I Pro
[55:39] it so I trust that those that were there
[55:42] can explain to the parent We Are One
[55:45] family we come from Heaven if you were
[55:48] here last Sunday we showed you that we
[55:50] are not American we are not African we
[55:53] are not Belgium we are not Switz I mean
[55:55] SS or whoever we are just the Bride of
[55:58] Jesus Christ so when we coming to
[56:00] marriages you need to know how to refer
[56:03] somebody where you need to stop we went
[56:05] through all of that amen so talk to
[56:09] somebody who was there they can tell you
[56:11] exactly the quote and the scripture and
[56:13] you can go with it Lord's willing again

[1:01:28] going on over there amen let's go to our
[1:01:30] scripture this
[1:01:32] morning Genesis chapter
[1:01:40] 22 glory to
[1:01:43] God can you hear me
[1:01:47] well can you hear me well in the
[1:01:50] back few
[1:01:52] people glory to God
[1:01:55] amen
[1:01:59] amen remove all the petty stuff
[1:02:02] away you're going to stay with your
[1:02:05] petty staff
[1:02:07] here let's go to
[1:02:10] heaven Genesis 22 if you dare you can
[1:02:13] say amen
[1:02:16] amen
[1:02:17] amen we going back again to the same
[1:02:20] scripture amen the Bible says and it
[1:02:23] came to pass after these things you know
[1:02:26] these things we went through that God
[1:02:28] told uh uh Abraham to remove Ishmael you
[1:02:33] remember that right he say after these
[1:02:36] things that God did tempt Abraham you
[1:02:40] understand this temptation now I don't
[1:02:42] know he's still coming like a NRA David
[1:02:46] said he did tempt Abraham and say to him
[1:02:49] Abraham and he said behold here I am you
[1:02:53] might be seated we know clearly here
[1:02:56] that the one who start this problem is
[1:02:58] God it was not Abraham Abraham was
[1:03:01] living peacefully God start or
[1:03:05] initiated the scene right here verse two
[1:03:09] and the Bible says and he says take now
[1:03:12] your
[1:03:13] son your only son Isaac whom you love so
[1:03:20] what God is asking here is not something
[1:03:24] that Abraham
[1:03:28] discussed it is not something that
[1:03:31] Abraham doesn't like amen God went to
[1:03:34] something that really have a
[1:03:37] penion has a liking between Abraham and
[1:03:40] whatever he was everybody okay so God
[1:03:44] asked Abraham something that he
[1:03:49] Lov amen something that he loves
[1:03:56] you need to understand these things
[1:03:57] deeply I already turned the corner
[1:04:00] because whatever you
[1:04:02] love is
[1:04:06] important amen they told Brother Bram
[1:04:09] when he went up
[1:04:11] there they told him whatever you
[1:04:15] love it's important to understand what
[1:04:18] you like amen he say whom you love and
[1:04:22] get you into the land of I send you the
[1:04:25] scripture this is where the temple
[1:04:26] supposed to be yes sir and offer him the
[1:04:29] first human sacrifice there for a burnt
[1:04:32] offering upon one of the mountains which
[1:04:36] I will tell you of so what is the
[1:04:39] offering right here who is the offering
[1:04:43] Isaac so the offering is clearly chosen
[1:04:46] identified by God to be his offering so
[1:04:50] the offering or the sacrifice is clear
[1:04:53] according to to this worship right here
[1:04:56] the sacrifice is a human being and that
[1:04:59] human being is Isaac who determine it
[1:05:02] God who chose it God who says to kill
[1:05:06] Isaac God so a death sentence is
[1:05:11] pronounced upon
[1:05:14] Isaac I know how I'm traveling amen
[1:05:19] Isaac has a deaf Pro I mean a deaf
[1:05:22] sentence a death verdict has has been
[1:05:24] put on
[1:05:25] Isaac the problem is had to get Isaac
[1:05:28] out of
[1:05:29] it we clear amen amen and Abraham rose
[1:05:33] up early in the morning and sat on his
[1:05:36] ass and took two of his young men with
[1:05:39] him and ASAC his son and split the wood
[1:05:43] for the burnt offering which is Isaac
[1:05:45] and Rose up and went to the place of
[1:05:48] which God has told him so he took the
[1:05:51] wood he took the fire he took the knife
[1:05:53] and he he also took his sacrifice it
[1:05:56] looked like he's going with his son but
[1:05:58] he's not going with his son the son now
[1:06:00] is called the
[1:06:02] sacrifice then on the third day Abraham
[1:06:05] lift up his eyes you know this already
[1:06:08] and saw the place of far off and Abraham
[1:06:11] say to his young men so he was already
[1:06:14] in the spirit of
[1:06:16] worship to his young man A B you here
[1:06:20] with the ass and I and L will go Yonder
[1:06:26] and worship and come again to you we
[1:06:30] spoke about this clearly that Abraham
[1:06:33] was talking about the
[1:06:35] resurrection because God told him that
[1:06:38] in Isaac Isaac will have S in other word
[1:06:41] Isaac will have children so based off
[1:06:44] that Abraham cling on to it he say okay
[1:06:46] if Isaac is going to have children so no
[1:06:49] matter what's going to happen to USAC
[1:06:50] God have to raise him back up and matter
[1:06:53] of fact the way I receive Isaac I
[1:06:55] receive a resurrection we went through
[1:06:56] that so the first faith of Abraham was
[1:07:01] that was based on the resurrection we
[1:07:05] went through
[1:07:06] this the
[1:07:08] resurrection everybody okay always is
[1:07:12] connected with
[1:07:18] death you cannot have a resurrection
[1:07:21] without a death amen
[1:07:24] are we together did you sleep well
[1:07:28] today you cannot have a resurrection
[1:07:31] without a
[1:07:33] death everybody okay so this faith is
[1:07:38] good but he will not spare
[1:07:42] Isaac amen amen are we together it's a
[1:07:46] good faith but death will still affect
[1:07:50] Isaac everybody okay even though it's a
[1:07:54] good faith we will recuperate Isaac but
[1:07:57] we will go through the pain of death
[1:08:00] first then ISAC will come back up is
[1:08:03] there a
[1:08:06] possibility to avoid
[1:08:10] death everybody okay everybody okay this
[1:08:14] faith is good if you kill Isaac he rise
[1:08:17] back up do we want to see ASAC
[1:08:22] dead
[1:08:25] Lord help
[1:08:28] me verse uh six now that was verse five
[1:08:33] verse 6 Abraham and Abraham took the
[1:08:37] wood of the burnt offering and laid it
[1:08:39] upon Isaac you know what it means his
[1:08:42] son the cross is is going there and he
[1:08:44] took the fire in his hand and a
[1:08:48] knife and they went both of them
[1:08:51] together Isaac is not going going with
[1:08:54] his son he's going with a
[1:08:56] sacrifice verse seven and Isaac
[1:09:00] spoke to Abraham his father and say my
[1:09:03] father we went through this you know
[1:09:04] what it means because the the child
[1:09:07] understood the order of worship he says
[1:09:10] my father and he said here I am my son
[1:09:13] and he said behold the fire and the wood
[1:09:17] but where is the Lamb for the for a what
[1:09:21] burnt
[1:09:22] offering
[1:09:25] according to the story what is the
[1:09:30] sacrifice is as worry about it no so he
[1:09:34] have a right to ask for a lamb because
[1:09:37] he's not in whatever going on between
[1:09:39] him and between Abraham and
[1:09:42] God he also has his own personal
[1:09:45] relationship yes sir everybody good so
[1:09:49] Isaac is asking for a lamb amen amen
[1:09:54] amen where is the Lamb glory to God Amen
[1:10:00] verse 8 and Abraham say my son God will
[1:10:06] provide what himself a lamb stop why
[1:10:11] should God provide the lamb when God
[1:10:13] already have a
[1:10:16] sacrifice why he didn't turn around and
[1:10:18] say
[1:10:19] Hey you the
[1:10:22] sacrifice amen
[1:10:24] why does God need to provide and another
[1:10:26] sacrifice God already said the sacrifice
[1:10:28] is Isaac I just show it to you it's
[1:10:30] coming from the scripture
[1:10:32] amen amen but Abraham is saying God will
[1:10:36] provide himself a
[1:10:39] sacrifice so that switch
[1:10:42] Faith from the first
[1:10:45] level into a different
[1:10:48] level on the first level we got the
[1:10:51] sacrifice but the sacrifice must die now
[1:10:55] another Faith open up and that faith is
[1:11:00] to look for a sacrifice that is not
[1:11:06] there amen they are looking for a lamb
[1:11:11] but the lamb is not there now Abraham
[1:11:14] say you know what God will produce the
[1:11:18] lamb because we are already past the
[1:11:21] threshold we can't go back home
[1:11:24] and go pick up a lamb and come back up
[1:11:26] here because it's going to take three
[1:11:28] days again going back and three days
[1:11:30] coming back it's going to be six days
[1:11:32] somehow in this corner God must do
[1:11:35] something amen amen amen everybody good
[1:11:39] amen this provision of a
[1:11:42] lamb is also a protection to
[1:11:48] Isaac everybody okay if a lamb is there
[1:11:51] why do we have to kill the boy
[1:11:56] that's it everybody okay everybody good
[1:11:59] so this caliber of
[1:12:01] Faith everybody okay it's a faith that
[1:12:05] can rescue a loved one come
[1:12:10] on when even God has condemned a
[1:12:14] [Applause]
[1:12:19] person if I lost you you tell me to
[1:12:22] repeat it again J you have to start
[1:12:25] swallowing Adult
[1:12:27] food if I lost you you tell me God
[1:12:31] determine a death sentence he was that
[1:12:34] save the Lord who can change that save
[1:12:37] the
[1:12:39] Lord I'm asking you a question is is my
[1:12:43] Bible different than your Bible who can
[1:12:46] stop what God has already spoken
[1:12:49] everybody okay according to that say the
[1:12:51] Lord you need to go with the faith of
[1:12:54] Resurrection the faith of Resurrection
[1:12:56] allow that sa the Lord to be
[1:12:59] accomplished then you can rescue back
[1:13:02] but this faith can override that amen
[1:13:06] thank you Jesus because the first Faith
[1:13:08] was based on the
[1:13:10] promise because the promise is in Isaac
[1:13:13] there will be a seed but the second
[1:13:16] faith can override the
[1:13:18] [Music]
[1:13:22] promise
[1:13:24] is he too
[1:13:26] strong I can't give you skim milk I told
[1:13:30] you we turn the corner it is a faith
[1:13:32] that can save a loved one to the
[1:13:37] utmost in other words this faith will do
[1:13:40] things that is beyond your
[1:13:46] brain Jesus amen am let me put it this
[1:13:51] way this faith
[1:13:54] will do things that is beyond your
[1:13:57] religious
[1:13:59] brain
[1:14:01] hallu thank
[1:14:03] youus in other word you can have that s
[1:14:06] the Lord but this faith can go above
[1:14:10] [Applause]
[1:14:15] that I let it soak as you swallow him
[1:14:20] praise
[1:14:22] God

[1:21:41] then on Sunday you begin to reboot
[1:21:44] yourself you're going to have a hard
[1:21:46] time claming but if throughout the week
[1:21:49] you working you listening you working
[1:21:51] you reading your Bible you cooking you
[1:21:53] listening you keep yourself under the
[1:21:55] atmosphere it's very easy to S to take
[1:21:58] off quickly we don't have to do the
[1:22:00] check engine the light all this kind of
[1:22:03] stuff let's go to uh Numbers Chapter
[1:22:07] 12
[1:22:09] amen father be with us verse one if you
[1:22:13] there you can say amen and Miriam and
[1:22:17] Aaron spoke against Moses when they were
[1:22:21] talking against the servant of God he
[1:22:23] was not there that's
[1:22:26] right and they spoke about Moses because
[1:22:30] of the ethopian woman those that were in
[1:22:33] question and answer yesterday I describ
[1:22:35] this
[1:22:38] thing these people were not speaking
[1:22:42] foolishly sir sir they were speaking
[1:22:45] with the scripture that's amen amen
[1:22:49] that's because Moses told them do not
[1:22:51] marry strength
[1:22:53] women if you were there in question and
[1:22:55] answer you know what I'm talking about
[1:22:57] they told them do not marry strange
[1:22:58] women and the same Moses goes and marry
[1:23:01] a strange
[1:23:05] woman you need to be very
[1:23:08] careful very careful especially when
[1:23:12] you're dealing with a Vindicated
[1:23:14] Prophet if you don't understand what the
[1:23:17] prophet is doing it's better to shut
[1:23:20] your mouth shut your mouth
[1:23:24] don't come and begin to challenge
[1:23:26] brother Bram because you don't know what
[1:23:28] brother Bram was
[1:23:30] doing the same Moses that says this the
[1:23:33] same Moses look like he's acting against
[1:23:35] the word of God and I Pro to you
[1:23:38] yesterday that Moses was a type of
[1:23:41] Christ and who was showing that Christ
[1:23:44] will be married to a strange woman he
[1:23:46] will be married to a gentile woman
[1:23:49] because the Old Testament Prophet were
[1:23:51] doing things according to the spirit of
[1:23:57] God who are you to to to argue to
[1:24:03] question a Vindicated
[1:24:08] Prophet who are
[1:24:12] you verse
[1:24:15] 12 vers uh chapter 12 verse 2 and they
[1:24:20] said has the Lord indeed spoken what
[1:24:23] only by Moses do you know what it
[1:24:26] means in other word Moses he's not the
[1:24:29] only one that can feel the
[1:24:31] anointing we also feel the
[1:24:34] anointing the spirit of God also work
[1:24:37] with
[1:24:40] us what does he think because he's the
[1:24:43] pastor God also speak to
[1:24:48] me God speak to you God put the order
[1:24:53] God said this is a prophet you are not a
[1:24:56] prophet even if God speaking to you you
[1:24:59] need to respect the order of
[1:25:01] [Applause]
[1:25:07] God he says in other word is God only
[1:25:11] speaking to Moses Miriam I'm a
[1:25:13] prophetess the anointing also hit me
[1:25:16] Aron I'm also a priest the anointing
[1:25:18] also hit me so what is Moses thinking he
[1:25:21] is
[1:25:23] with your
[1:25:26] anointing has he not spoken also by who
[1:25:31] us so God spoke through Miriam God spoke
[1:25:35] through Aaron they thought because God
[1:25:37] used them they can challenge the
[1:25:40] Vindicated
[1:25:41] Prophet listen to me carefully even if
[1:25:45] you a preacher no matter how much
[1:25:47] anointing you will have on you never
[1:25:50] touch brother Bram
[1:25:53] never touch the prophet of this hour
[1:25:56] never have the audacity to even try to
[1:26:00] change what brother Bram
[1:26:03] say stay in your
[1:26:09] position Ephesian 4 doesn't make you the
[1:26:12] pastor of the age the pastor of the age
[1:26:15] is William Marion
[1:26:21] pram
[1:26:22] [Music]
[1:26:24] Hallelujah
[1:26:25] speak hallelujah amen he say has he not
[1:26:29] spoken also by us and the Lord did what
[1:26:32] heard it did they say Moses heard it
[1:26:35] no watch what you talking in your
[1:26:38] bedroom watch what you talking in your
[1:26:40] homes watch what you talking in the car
[1:26:43] God is listening to
[1:26:45] you and you can get in
[1:26:49] trouble amen am verse three now the man
[1:26:54] Moses was how very Meek very humble
[1:26:58] that's right so because of humility it's
[1:27:00] very easy for people to trample on you
[1:27:02] that's right that's right if they see
[1:27:05] you quiet they say okay this is the one
[1:27:07] we can
[1:27:11] tackle amen amen above all the men which
[1:27:16] were upon the face of what the Earth so
[1:27:18] in other word if you screen everybody in
[1:27:21] the face of the Earth no body was as
[1:27:22] humble as Moses so very easy to stop I
[1:27:27] mean to trample on but very
[1:27:31] dangerous everybody okay everybody okay
[1:27:34] amen and the Lord spoke suddenly to who
[1:27:38] Moses I thought Miriam say the Lord
[1:27:41] speak to her I thought Aaron said the
[1:27:44] Lord speak to him why didn't go God go
[1:27:47] back to speak to them God went back to
[1:27:50] Moses that's right
[1:27:54] he went to Moses and to Aaron and to
[1:27:58] Miriam come out all you three to the
[1:28:01] what Tabernacle of the congregation and
[1:28:04] the three did what came out in other way
[1:28:06] you you you come up here come
[1:28:12] here everybody okay everybody okay verse
[1:28:16] 5 and the Lord came down in the pillar
[1:28:19] of what the cloud and stood in the door
[1:28:22] of the what Tabernacle and called who
[1:28:25] Aaron and Miriam and they both came what
[1:28:27] came forth and he
[1:28:30] said hear now my word in other words
[1:28:33] listen to me
[1:28:34] carefully if there be a prophet among
[1:28:38] you amen I the Lord will make myself
[1:28:41] known to him in a what vision and I will
[1:28:44] speak to him in a what dream my servant
[1:28:47] Moses is not
[1:28:51] so I'm not reading me I'm reading God in
[1:28:54] other word god Moses was a prophet sir
[1:28:58] we all know that and God is taking Moses
[1:29:02] away from the rank of the prophet and
[1:29:04] he's putting Moses above he said Moses
[1:29:07] is not just a prophet like any other
[1:29:10] Prophet he's a prophet that is higher
[1:29:12] than all the
[1:29:16] prophets everybody okay he says more not
[1:29:20] so with Moses who is faithful in all my
[1:29:25] house with
[1:29:27] him Moses will I speak how mouth to
[1:29:31] mouth even how apparently
[1:29:34] openly and not in what dark speeches so
[1:29:37] when God was speaking to Moses God was
[1:29:40] not using symbols no sir like you see a
[1:29:43] white I mean a white horse right right
[1:29:46] there is coming up and he has a sword no
[1:29:48] he was talking to Moses plan this is
[1:29:50] what I'm trying to do this is what is
[1:29:52] going on but if it's another Prophet
[1:29:54] then God begin to give
[1:29:57] symbols amen am he says and the
[1:30:01] similitude of the Lord shall he what
[1:30:03] behold in other word if there is
[1:30:05] somebody that I even gave access to look
[1:30:09] at me how I look like it's
[1:30:13] Moses because Moses one time ask God I
[1:30:16] want to see you and God let him see him
[1:30:19] right am amen
[1:30:23] amen wherefore then were you not afraid
[1:30:27] to speak against my servant who Moses
[1:30:30] you need to be careful what you talk
[1:30:34] about people that's right especially if
[1:30:37] they are used by
[1:30:39] God watch out because the caliber of the
[1:30:44] anointing it's telling you something
[1:30:47] watch out
[1:30:49] amen how can a man take his hand and put
[1:30:54] it where the angel of the Lord touch and
[1:30:57] his hand is matching the angel of the
[1:31:00] Lord and you come and you begin to talk
[1:31:03] again and you are challenging such a
[1:31:08] man
[1:31:11] foolishness amen amen and the anger of
[1:31:14] the Lord was kindered against them and
[1:31:17] he did what departed and the cloud
[1:31:19] departed from off the Tabernacle and
[1:31:22] behold what happened Miriam became
[1:31:25] leprous White as what snow remember last
[1:31:28] Sunday and Aron looked upon Miriam and
[1:31:32] behold she was half
[1:31:35] lepos that leprosy never hit
[1:31:41] Aon he only touched the
[1:31:44] woman let me leave it everybody okay
[1:31:48] everybody okay and Aaron said to Moses
[1:31:53] Ellas my brother no my
[1:31:57] Lord I don't know if you reading the
[1:31:59] Bible with me amen the one that
[1:32:03] disrespected is Moses when God came he
[1:32:08] struck and he struck Miriam and Miriam
[1:32:11] is lepos in other word and that leprosy
[1:32:14] brother Bram say that it was the last
[1:32:16] stage in now word Miriam is
[1:32:20] doomed
[1:32:24] Miriam is doomed with Leprosy at the
[1:32:29] last
[1:32:32] stage is there any
[1:32:39] Mercy Isaac is doomed with death is
[1:32:44] there any
[1:32:47] rescue
[1:32:48] Hallelujah Miriam did what is wrong
[1:32:52] spoke against the man of God is there a
[1:32:56] [Music]
[1:32:58] rescue this faith is a different
[1:33:02] caliber let's see what
[1:33:05] happened and Aaron said to Moses elas
[1:33:09] who my
[1:33:13] Lord who
[1:33:16] Lord who is my
[1:33:20] lordes
[1:33:22] now Moses become a what
[1:33:26] Lord is my Bible different than you no
[1:33:29] sir
[1:33:31] Moses is now called my
[1:33:37] Lord can you say amen amen
[1:33:41] am Aaron is talking to Moses he says
[1:33:45] elas my Lord I beseech who the he's
[1:33:49] begging to who Moses why is he not
[1:33:52] begging to
[1:33:56] god let's continue lay not the sin upon
[1:34:01] us has Moses the right to lay sin upon
[1:34:05] people
[1:34:11] Jesus is Moses at the position to be
[1:34:14] laying sin upon
[1:34:18] somebody Aaron is talking to who Moses
[1:34:22] he's talking to him using the word my
[1:34:25] Lord and he's saying do not lay your sin
[1:34:28] upon in other word you can sin against
[1:34:32] Moses let me help you because so we can
[1:34:35] move on quickly God told Moses when you
[1:34:38] go into Egypt and make you a
[1:34:41] [Applause]
[1:34:43] God we okay now so Moses is God and
[1:34:49] Aaron is addressing him like he's
[1:34:51] addressing God am because Aaron was the
[1:34:54] prophet of Moses God say I make you God
[1:34:58] and Aaron will be your Prophet so the
[1:35:01] prophet is talking to
[1:35:05] God that's why he said my Lord do not
[1:35:08] lay the sin upon this
[1:35:12] one in other word
[1:35:16] Moses have a
[1:35:18] right to exercise his VOR right as
[1:35:24] [Applause]
[1:35:28] God maybe I won't touch what I'm trying
[1:35:30] to preach maybe I won't touch what I'm
[1:35:33] trying to preach Abraham had the right
[1:35:36] to speak something and and and override
[1:35:41] that save the Lord that's right
[1:35:44] am am amen continue to swallow amen amen
[1:35:51] is it to strong if it's too strong we we
[1:35:54] put a rear and I begin to go back again
[1:35:56] to catch you where you
[1:35:58] are the problem is you don't know who
[1:36:00] you are when I told you inside of you
[1:36:03] it's God you don't
[1:36:09] understand everybody okay the faith of
[1:36:13] Abraham can go and change what God want
[1:36:17] and swap the
[1:36:18] sacrifice that's it amen so Aon is
[1:36:22] turning because God revealed to them
[1:36:25] clearly who Moses is and he understood
[1:36:28] that hey Moses is nobody it's God's body
[1:36:32] that's
[1:36:33] correct because God say I speak to him
[1:36:36] month to
[1:36:38] month then I need to go talk to God's
[1:36:41] body but when you talk to God's body
[1:36:43] he's calling him my Lord he said do not
[1:36:46] put the
[1:36:48] sin who can't sin is it Moses of God
[1:36:53] watch what is going on he says wherein
[1:36:57] ye have Sinn let's go to verse 11 and
[1:37:00] Aaron said to oh Moses alas my Lord I
[1:37:03] beseech you lay not the sin Upon Us amen
[1:37:09] wherein we have done foolishly and
[1:37:12] wherein we have what sin who should have
[1:37:15] lay the sin it's it's who God not
[1:37:18] Moses watch verse 12 let not her let her
[1:37:23] not be as one dead and whom the fleshes
[1:37:27] have consumed when he when he comes out
[1:37:30] of his mother's womb in other word a
[1:37:32] still baby that was dead in a mother's
[1:37:35] womb when they come up they come up a
[1:37:37] little bit wiish like somebody who have
[1:37:39] uh what
[1:37:41] leprosy that's what it
[1:37:43] means verse 13 and Moses cried to the
[1:37:48] Lord saying do what heal her
[1:37:52] now oh God Amen so this sentence here
[1:37:59] whatever happened to Miriam that look
[1:38:01] like she's doomed she's in the last
[1:38:04] stage Moses turn
[1:38:07] around despite the fault of
[1:38:11] mam yes sir yes sir despite the fault of
[1:38:16] Miram yes sir I know you you have a hard
[1:38:20] time swallowing some of the stuff that
[1:38:21] is coming out despite the fault of
[1:38:26] Miriam everybody okay and Moses turned
[1:38:29] to God and said heal her
[1:38:34] now who is
[1:38:37] Moses that's if the Lord leprosy last
[1:38:41] stage who are you to change
[1:38:45] God's he says oh God heal her now oh God
[1:38:48] I do what bese thee so who's bleeding
[1:38:52] Moses and the Lord said to Moses if her
[1:38:56] father had but spit in her face should
[1:39:00] she not be ashamed how many days seven
[1:39:05] days let her be shut out from the camp
[1:39:08] how many seven days and after that let
[1:39:12] her be received in how
[1:39:15] again amen so God give the remedy to
[1:39:20] cure M that's
[1:39:23] right based on what Moses
[1:39:26] said and he open up he said put her
[1:39:29] seven days outside and she's going to
[1:39:32] get
[1:39:35] healed Lord help me verse 15 and Miriam
[1:39:40] was shut out from the camp how many days
[1:39:43] seven days and the people did what
[1:39:46] Journey
[1:39:47] n that's it that's it come on

[1:39:59] exodus they have to leave Egypt all the
[1:40:03] way to the promised
[1:40:04] land the case of Miriam put a
[1:40:12] [Music]
[1:40:14] Breck let me go again this way the
[1:40:17] prayer of Moses because of his
[1:40:22] sister stop the program of
[1:40:27] God and delay the program of God s days

[1:40:43] that's are we together are we together
[1:40:47] are we
[1:40:49] together the program of God was running
[1:40:53] but the faith of Moses goes and put a
[1:40:56] push a
[1:40:57] pause and say you cannot continue like
[1:41:00] this you solve this issue then we
[1:41:03] continue in other word you cannot
[1:41:06] continue this Exodus without Miriam
[1:41:09] going in
[1:41:10] hallelujah thank you
[1:41:12] [Applause]
[1:41:14] Lord do you understand what I'm saying
[1:41:17] if Miriam is left over we can not go to
[1:41:21] the promised
[1:41:22] [Music]
[1:41:22] [Applause]
[1:41:23] land the only way we can continue this
[1:41:26] journey M have to go back in
[1:41:31] track but she did something bad against
[1:41:34] the prophet of God that's fine there is
[1:41:36] a faith that can override yes

[1:41:42] will be like

[1:42:07] again amen amen and then the journey
[1:42:10] begin to continue because a leper must
[1:42:13] be outside the
[1:42:15] congregation but Miriam cannot continue
[1:42:17] like that they push the PA pull
[1:42:20] everything thing put her in and the
[1:42:22] journey continued who did that
[1:42:27] Moses who swap the lamb for Isaac

[1:43:15] faith is coming from the Lord girl amen
[1:43:19] jum to verse the remaining you can read
[1:43:22] that at home if you thereare you can say
[1:43:23] amen
[1:43:26] amen and he was so when elishah the man
[1:43:29] of God had heard that the king of Israel
[1:43:33] had rent his clothes that he sent to the
[1:43:36] king saying why have you rent your
[1:43:38] clothes you know what it
[1:43:39] means let him come now to me and he
[1:43:43] shall know that there is a prophet Where
[1:43:45] in Israel remember no one was healed
[1:43:47] from leprosy you remember that no one
[1:43:49] was healed from leprosy
[1:43:51] this is the first case that's going to
[1:43:52] be healed from leprosy and Elisha is
[1:43:55] putting his ministry his Prophet Mentor
[1:43:58] right there if it doesn't work there is
[1:44:00] no prophet in Israel but nobody was
[1:44:02] healed before everybody okay and neon so
[1:44:07] neon came with his horses and with his
[1:44:09] Chariot and stood at the door of the
[1:44:11] House of Elisha and Elisha sent a
[1:44:14] messenger to him saying go and do what
[1:44:17] wash in Jordan seven times seven times

[1:44:34] surely come to me and stand and call on

[1:44:49] and we call over the what leper
[1:44:52] everybody okay jum to verse 13 and his
[1:44:56] servant came near and spoke to him and
[1:44:58] say my father if the prophet had beat

[1:46:02] let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are
[1:46:04] approaching you again humbly this
[1:46:06] morning Father we thank you once again
[1:46:08] for your grace your love your mercy and
[1:46:11] for everything you have been doing for
[1:46:12] us father may you open again the windows
[1:46:15] of Heaven as you spoke in your word that
[1:46:18] when we ask rain you will send rain
[1:46:20] abundantly may you Reign abundantly
[1:46:23] again father in this service and bless
[1:46:25] your children forgive every sin every
[1:46:28] lack of consecration may you move that
[1:46:31] away from us Lord but may your mercy be
[1:46:34] upon us this morning as you speaking to
[1:46:36] us so that we can catch the mind of the
[1:46:38] spirit in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[1:46:42] amen my subject this morning is the four
[1:46:46] phases of rof the bride's faith this is
[1:46:50] where we stopped last week because I
[1:46:53] have to switch the sermon amen the
[1:46:55] sermon title we are still in the last
[1:46:58] phase of rof rof rewarded and we under
[1:47:01] the condition where rof is waiting for
[1:47:04] boas to finish the work of redemption so
[1:47:07] that boas will come and they can be
[1:47:09] United in the body they were already
[1:47:11] United by the word but they need a
[1:47:14] Corporal Union but before the Corporal
[1:47:16] Union something must be roof must be at
[1:47:19] a certain level at a certain State
[1:47:22] before she can meet back boas from the
[1:47:25] finishing of the work of redemption in
[1:47:27] the tabernac or when we transfer our
[1:47:29] data ruie is resting there being going
[1:47:33] into the
[1:47:34] transformation because when you stay in
[1:47:36] the presence of the Lord longer
[1:47:39] enough amen some of the D element begin
[1:47:43] to be transferred to you amen amen Moses
[1:47:47] spoke to God 40 days and when Moses
[1:47:50] begin to come down the face of Moses
[1:47:53] begin to shine so you cannot stay in the
[1:47:56] presence of the Lord and continue to
[1:47:58] remain the same when they took the road
[1:48:01] of Aaron they put that in the holiest
[1:48:03] the road never stay a joy stick when
[1:48:06] they came the next day they found out
[1:48:08] that the road bed he even brought fruit
[1:48:11] in 24 hours so as we staying Under the
[1:48:15] Sun in the presence of the Lord we are
[1:48:19] maturing every single day every Green
[1:48:22] Spot is coming off away and the mature
[1:48:25] spot begin to show in display because
[1:48:28] God is coming to take a bread that look
[1:48:31] like him because we must be like him we
[1:48:35] must be born of his bone flesh of his
[1:48:38] flesh and spirit of his Spirit any
[1:48:41] question so
[1:48:43] far what are we dealing with it today
[1:48:46] amen when we spoke in shifting to a
[1:48:49] great faith it was part 887 we found out
[1:48:53] clearly that brother brandham said that
[1:48:55] there is a problem in America he said
[1:48:58] the problem was on the laying on hand
[1:49:01] which was a Jewish tradition and it was
[1:49:03] not a gentile Faith traveling from that
[1:49:07] line brother Bram is saying
[1:49:11] this brother Bram say everything that is
[1:49:14] under his power and he recognized that
[1:49:18] what give him some more volume my
[1:49:21] brother yes get this
[1:49:23] one let's preach because you you usually
[1:49:27] say Amen yes so if nobody says amen it's
[1:49:32] going to work go ahead and try that
[1:49:35] one go ahead and say something amen
[1:49:38] glory to God okay he recognized that
[1:49:41] sickness and what sin and everything was
[1:49:44] under his what control he's talking
[1:49:46] about the Roman Centurion that he could
[1:49:49] do what control
[1:49:50] brother Bram say now I think that is the
[1:49:53] way we should see it how
[1:49:55] [Applause]
[1:49:57] today everybody okay he say I have tried
[1:50:00] for what years but see what does it
[1:50:04] there is many other brother on the field
[1:50:07] and they do what lay hands on the Seck
[1:50:10] and they have what great
[1:50:12] success brother Bram say he was trying
[1:50:16] to get the people to get to the level of
[1:50:19] speaking the word and something happened
[1:50:22] brother Bram say he tried for years but
[1:50:24] he found out that the people are still
[1:50:27] laying hand on the sick and as long as
[1:50:30] they lay hand on the sick and they
[1:50:31] recover the people still cling to that
[1:50:34] tradition because it is bringing result
[1:50:37] there it is
[1:50:39] Lord Jesus everybody okay if you still
[1:50:43] want me to lay hand on you in this
[1:50:45] church I will do it you will get result
[1:50:48] but that's not what God God is waiting
[1:50:50] for
[1:50:51] [Applause]
[1:50:53] you everybody okay brother Bram say they
[1:50:57] have great success and that way I just
[1:51:00] what broke it down and that and done
[1:51:02] what quit about a year ago brother Bram
[1:51:04] was discouraged he said I'm trying to
[1:51:07] pump them up but they are brother all
[1:51:09] over that keep laying hand and when they
[1:51:12] lay hand people are heal so when you
[1:51:15] come up you say you don't need that
[1:51:16] people don't get it they say so and so
[1:51:18] pray for me and I got here I'm reading
[1:51:21] brother Branham I'm not throwing any
[1:51:24] stone to anyone I'm just reading brother
[1:51:26] Bram so throw Stone to brother brandham

[2:12:24] amen the Bible says this Galatians 2:7
[2:12:28] this is Paul speaking Paul says but
[2:12:31] contras when they saw that the gospel of
[2:12:35] the uncircumcision uncircumcision means
[2:12:37] the Gentile because we were not under
[2:12:40] the law of circumcision it was the Jews
[2:12:42] that were circumstanced you understand
[2:12:44] that right if not you tell me I load you
[2:12:47] with scripture
[2:12:48] he says for the gospel of the
[2:12:51] uncircumcised in other word the gospel
[2:12:53] of the Heathen or the Gentile was
[2:12:55] committed to who me and the gospel of
[2:12:58] the who circumcision the Jews was to who
[2:13:01] Peter so according to the scripture P
[2:13:05] Peter is sent to
[2:13:07] who and Paul is sent to who Gentiles the
[2:13:11] Gentile or the
[2:13:14] hidden this is UN circumstance and these
[2:13:18] are
[2:13:19] circumstance it's two line okay there's
[2:13:22] two lane on this highway there is an
[2:13:25] Highway for Peter and there is a Highway
[2:13:27] for Paul you need to stay on your lane
[2:13:31] because we keep Crossing Lane and it's

[2:13:38] accident if there is a solid yellow line
[2:13:42] in a midle it tell you do not pass stay
[2:13:45] on your
[2:13:46] lane

[2:13:57] that worketh effectually in who Peter to
[2:14:00] be what the apostleship of the
[2:14:02] circumcision the same was m in who me
[2:14:06] toward the who Gentile Paul is saying in
[2:14:09] Peter God is working powerfully but he's
[2:14:13] working powerfully toward the who the
[2:14:15] Jews but in me he's working mly toward
[2:14:17] the who the Gentiles verse n and when
[2:14:21] James seas and who John who seems to be
[2:14:24] what pillars perceive the grace that was
[2:14:27] given to me they gave to me and bar and
[2:14:31] Barnabas the right hand of what
[2:14:34] Fellowship that we should go to the who
[2:14:36] Heathen and day to the who the
[2:14:38] circumcision so when they understood
[2:14:40] Paul they said brother we're doing the
[2:14:42] same work shake your hand we recognize
[2:14:45] that you have uh a Ministry for from the
[2:14:48] Lord you go to the Gentile we will going
