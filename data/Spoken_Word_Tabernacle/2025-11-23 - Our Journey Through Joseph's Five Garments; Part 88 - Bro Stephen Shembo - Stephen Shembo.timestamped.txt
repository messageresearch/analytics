[0:00] to be a servant of God. Billy Graham,
[0:05] we have the statement brother there has
[0:07] IT
[0:08] WHEN IT WAS ASKED BILLY GRAHAM BY
[0:10] CERTAIN WHO WHAT WAS THIS GREAT
[0:15] contradiction about THE TRINITY
[0:18] WAS THERE THREE GODS THREE ACTUAL GODS
[0:21] OR HOW WAS IT ONE PLACE LOOK LIKE THREE
[0:23] GODS AND ONE LOOKED LIKE THIS BILLY GRIM
[0:25] SAID IT HASN'T BEEN revealed nobody
[0:28] knows
[0:31] My
[0:33] &gt;&gt; IF THERE IS THREE GODS, WE ARE HEATHENS.
[0:39] &gt;&gt; LIKE THE JEWS SAID, "WHICH ONE OF THEM
[0:41] IS YOUR GOD? The Father? Is the Son your
[0:43] God? Or is the Holy Ghost your God?"
[0:48] There's only one God.
[0:51] AND THOSE ARE NOT THREE PERSONALITIES.
[0:54] FOR A PERSONALITY HAS TO BE A PERSON.
[0:58] There can't be A PERSONALITY WITHOUT
[1:00] BEING A PERSON. You know that. How can
[1:03] anything be a personality without BEING
[1:05] A PERSON? OH, SAID WE DON'T BELIEVE IN
[1:07] THREE personal gods. We believe in three
[1:09] personalities of the same God. Well,
[1:11] before it can be a personality, IT HAS
[1:13] TO BE A PERSON.
[1:17] What is it then? You'd say it's NOT
[1:19] THREE GODS. IT'S THREE offices of the
[1:22] same God.
[1:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25] He was the father in the beginning that
[1:26] hung over the the wilderness in in the
[1:29] flame of fire, the burning bush.
[1:31] FATHERHOOD,
[1:33] GOD JUST AS IT GOT THROUGH SIN CONDENSED
[1:36] COMING DOWN. THAT WAS THE HIGHEST ORDER,
[1:41] the spirit,
[1:45] the the the
[1:48] goth,
[1:50] THE ZOEY, THE THE LIFE OF GOD HIMSELF
[1:54] MADE IN A FORM OF A PILLAR of fire.
[1:58] AND THAT SAME [screaming] ONE AFTER
[2:00] BEING IN THE fatherhood
[2:02] became the son and the spirit OF THE WAS
[2:07] IN THE BURNING BUSH WAS IN THE MAN
[2:10] CHRIST.
[2:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:13] &gt;&gt; AND IT BROUGHT FORTH THE SAME EVIDENCE
[2:15] THAT THE FIRE did
[2:18] said if I do not the works of MY FATHER
[2:19] DON'T BELIEVE ME.
[2:23] Every tree will bear record of its own
[2:24] fruit.
[2:27] And then actually become man, SEE IT
[2:30] DROP DOWN FROM supernatural into
[2:33] something tangible that could be
[2:34] touched,
[2:37] a body.
[2:39] AND THROUGH THE SACRIFICIAL DEATH AND
[2:42] THE SUPREME SACRIFICE OF THIS ONE God
[2:47] Jesus, HE SAID, I AND MY father are one.
[2:52] &gt;&gt; My father dwelleth in me. Can and no one
[2:56] could read that any planer.
[2:59] THEY SAID, "WHY DON'T YOU SHOW US THE
[3:01] father and it'll it'll satisfy us?" John
[3:04] 14:8. He said, "I've been so long with
[3:07] you, you don't know me."
[3:10] He said, "When you see the f when you
[3:12] see me, you see my father." As a lady
[3:15] once jumped up, she said, "WELL, BROTHER
[3:17] BRANDON, SHE SAID, you the father and
[3:19] the son are one, just like you and your
[3:21] wife are one." I said, "Oh, no, they're
[3:23] not."
[3:24] I said, "Do you see me?" She said,
[3:26] "Yes." I said, "You see my wife?" Said,
[3:28] "No." I said, "Then they're not the same
[3:29] kind of one."
[3:31] Jesus said, "When you seen me, you have
[3:33] seen the father." [music]
[3:36] The father put

[55:05] then it's over. Amen. So, January the
[55:08] 17th, it's our question and answer.

[55:18] married uh married couple meeting, it's

[55:29] on Wednesday.
[55:31] Everybody heard me.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Everybody heard me.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; If you come on Wednesday, we will open
[55:36] up the door and let you come in here and
[55:38] spend some time in prayer. No problem.
[55:41] But remember, we don't have service on
[55:43] Wednesday. We got service on Tuesday at
[55:46] 7:30. So the one who will be preaching
[55:49] will take 30 minute because usually our
[55:51] prayer service is on Tuesday. So we
[55:54] preach 30 minute and we start praying.
[55:56] So we got the sermon and we got the uh
[55:59] prayer together. Now you will be praying
[56:01] in church in Zoom sometime I don't even
[56:04] see who's there now you coming into

[56:23] desperation so when you desperate just
[56:26] come in let's pray and enter in in the
[56:29] presence of the Lord. Amen. So, on
[56:31] Tuesday at 7:30, let's be there. I know
[56:33] it's a it's a little change, but we're
[56:35] trying to give you a f uh a Wednesday to

[56:40] Amen.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Our building project, we catching up on
[56:44] bills. So, please continue to pray,
[56:47] pray, pray and do what you can do and
[56:50] support the best that you can. We poured
[56:53] the concrete over there without
[56:54] finishing their bills. So we pour that
[56:56] by faith and they accepted to even do
[56:59] that because they spend their own money
[57:01] to do that. Now we catching up quickly
[57:04] and we moving on. Amen.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; So congratulation. Anyway, we was uh you
[57:10] remember they came the first time to
[57:12] pour and they could not pour because it
[57:14] was an error that was done and then the
[57:17] cement and everything was already mixed
[57:19] together. So we have to pay for the loss
[57:23] &gt;&gt; and it's $8,000.
[57:28] It's sinking.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Did he hit the bottom yet?
[57:33] [laughter]
[57:34] It's 8,000K. Amen. But God knows
[57:37] everything.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; God will provide.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah. The pouring was the total bill was
[57:42] 67K.
[57:45] So that's why when you give $2 and
[57:47] everything,
[57:50] got be. You remember I showed you how to
[57:53] put a $100 and $200. You remember that?
[57:56] So by God's grace, we we attack this
[57:59] with our tithing, with our offering,
[58:00] with our building fund the best that we
[58:02] can. We have 18K remaining. So
[58:05] congratulation. We're moving from 67 all
[58:08] the way to 80. [cheering]
[58:11] [applause]
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So I still have to clear
[58:18] that one and then get in the next bill
[58:19] for the people that frame over there and
[58:21] pay them and keep moving. So, we
[58:23] catching up, but I'm moving by faith.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; So, hop on with me and let's can
[58:28] continue do the best that we can. By
[58:30] God's grace, everything will be well.
[58:33] The way we're moving, it's a miracle.
[58:35] The way this church operate, it's a
[58:37] miracle. Where the money is coming from,
[58:39] it's a miracle. The strength we have,
[58:42] it's a miracle. So, spoken word from the
[58:44] beginning all the way to eternity, it
[58:47] will always be a miracle. Amen.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is a lot of sacrifice because
[58:53] this is squeezing us to the end. If I
[58:56] show you our bank account, you will be
[58:57] like, how how do you even work with
[58:59] this? That's the way I work. Amen.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; So everything that is entering, we got
[59:04] holes somewhere. We are kind of patching
[59:07] some hole. So continue praying, continue
[59:09] to do what you got to do. Before you
[59:11] know it, you will have your fellowship
[59:13] hall and everything clear. We clear
[59:14] there?
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; Everybody happy?
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; You have a problem with finances again?
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Do you have a problem with finances in
[59:27] this church? After last sermon, sir,
[59:29] &gt;&gt; after last sermon,
[59:31] &gt;&gt; the problem is not those who have
[59:33] riches.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; The problem is those who trust
[59:37] &gt;&gt; in their riches.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; So now you have opened up your mind
[59:41] &gt;&gt; to receive the blessing of God.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; Because you were afraid to even ask God
[59:46] for something.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. Amen.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Until they squeeze you on the bills
[59:53] &gt;&gt; and then you come back crying. You say,
[59:55] "Lord, I don't know why I'm going
[59:56] through trial."
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Go ask your father. You say, "Give me
[1:00:02] money.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Give me money so I can pay my bills."
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Is that a problem? [screaming]
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; The Bible say, "Give your offering and
[1:00:12] your tithing and God will do what?"
[1:00:15] Open up the water
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; and pour what water
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; pour blessing until you have room to put
[1:00:23] them.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; But you still have room
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; and you are comfortable.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Because you spiritual
[1:00:34] because you're spiritual.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Don't worry. Some of you will be
[1:00:37] regretting when we go into the rapture.
[1:00:41] You'll be like, "Ah, I wish I knew."
[1:00:44] [laughter]
[1:00:45] That's why the Holy Spirit is unfolding
[1:00:47] that to you so you know your benefit
[1:00:50] because he died for it. David even say,
[1:00:53] "Forget not."
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; So there is a potential to forget.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; Forget not. Brother Brandham spoke about
[1:00:59] a parable of the mother who had checks.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; And the mother was living poor.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; Why did brother Brandham put that in the
[1:01:08] message? Why did he came in the message?
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; Beautiful pictures.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; And she thought he was beautiful
[1:01:14] pictures.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Just like you looking at the Bible, you
[1:01:17] think it's a beautiful book.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; It's not a beautiful book. It got power
[1:01:22] in it.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; There is power in the Bible. There is
[1:01:26] power in the promises of God
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; to take care of your trouble.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; The woman was suffering
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; with a good relationship with her son.
[1:01:37] didn't know the son was already
[1:01:39] according to the son I'm taking care of
[1:01:41] my mother
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; but according to the mother this son
[1:01:46] goes there he sent me beautiful picture
[1:01:48] so whose fault is it
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; so whose fault is it
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; god or us
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; so don't blame me to god
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; and don't use your covering of I'm going
[1:01:59] through trial as I'm going through trial
[1:02:01] this is the trial this is the burden
[1:02:03] this is the cross how many crosses
[1:02:05] you've been carrying
[1:02:09] You also need a sermon of siren.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Even Jesus. Ah.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Okay. Let's go to our sermon. When you
[1:02:18] start like this, I need to go. Do you
[1:02:20] know that they helped Jesus on the
[1:02:22] cross?
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; He was God. Almighty God, all powerful
[1:02:26] God. Why did they help God?
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; You having hard time? I now understand
[1:02:37] why the Holy Spirit want me to go back a
[1:02:39] little bit on what I spoke last Sunday
[1:02:42] so we can uh burn the last the remaining
[1:02:46] of the
[1:02:48] whoever was lingering let's just remove
[1:02:51] it completely from spoken word. Amen.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; My people suffer from lack of knowledge.
[1:02:56] Amen.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham keeps saying we are
[1:02:58] living below our privileges. Below our
[1:03:01] privileges. All we know about below our
[1:03:03] privileges is spiritual.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; But we are natural people.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; We get used to mediocrity for a long
[1:03:14] time until we call this my sickness.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; And then we push the blessing. We say
[1:03:22] no. When the rapture will come,
[1:03:24] everything will be changed.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; I will not.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Will you need healing in the rapture?
[1:03:32] Amen.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; What are you going to do with strength
[1:03:35] in the rapture? You got to glorify body.
[1:03:39] [applause]
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; Okay. If you having a hard time flat
[1:03:43] attendant, let's prepare for take off.
[1:03:46] Let's go to the reading of our
[1:03:48] scripture.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; It's a really strong noise, sister Roof.
[1:03:52] I don't know where it's coming from,
[1:03:58] but I know it's the devil. Amen.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[1:04:10] are approaching you again humbly this
[1:04:12] morning. Father, thanking you for your
[1:04:14] grace, your love, your mercy, and for
[1:04:17] everything you have been doing for us.
[1:04:19] Father, this is as far as I can go with
[1:04:22] the ability you have given me. But when
[1:04:24] it comes to speaking to your bride, he
[1:04:27] only takes the supernatural action of
[1:04:29] the Holy Spirit. Father, may you move me
[1:04:32] completely out and the audience
[1:04:34] completely out. May you remove any
[1:04:37] attack from the world of darkness. Any
[1:04:40] spirit that is trying to hinder the
[1:04:42] service. Father, we rebuke it away from
[1:04:44] this place. May you protect us. Bless
[1:04:47] your word. Bless this audience visible
[1:04:50] and invisible in the name of Jesus
[1:04:53] Christ. Amen.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; My subject this morning is our life
[1:04:58] journey through Joseph 5 garment part

[1:05:07] 88. 88. Eternity. Eternity.
[1:05:13] How did you make it to 88? Sermon.
[1:05:18] My theme if we can get that
[1:05:22] is season.
[1:05:27] Hopefully if we can get this today
[1:05:30] we will try to begin to maneuver toward
[1:05:33] the surface and get to part of our house
[1:05:37] then we can change the government.
[1:05:39] Season of opportunity for a better or a
[1:05:43] worst future.
[1:05:50] for a better
[1:05:53] or worse
[1:05:59] future.
[1:06:02] Amen.

[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; God cannot send his word and joking.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; Did you hear the testimony of Sister
[1:06:13] Miriam?
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I didn't hear you clap loud
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; because I know how she suffered like
[1:06:21] two, three years
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; to get this house and it's not working.
[1:06:24] It's not working and only now. Why did
[1:06:27] he came only now?
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Because it's the season.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; She got 88k.
[1:06:35] 88. Today it's 88. She said Miriam was
[1:06:39] 88. Majority were working. $88,000
[1:06:44] given to her
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; for $0.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; $88. [applause]
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Some of you are still spinning.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; When I tell you God can give you
[1:06:58] anything, you still struggling in your
[1:07:00] mind. 88.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; You don't remember how the Bible says
[1:07:05] that he give to the sinner the power to
[1:07:07] work and to give to the one who's rich.
[1:07:10] You don't remember all those scripture.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; 88k. Today it's 88
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; 88 $88,000
[1:07:17] given toward the down payment and the
[1:07:20] closing cost. And she didn't pay a
[1:07:22] penny. I told her, I said, "Sister, get
[1:07:24] your down payment and go buy some
[1:07:26] furniture and fill your house."
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; 88.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to help you remove that
[1:07:33] blockage in your mind.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Too much reasoning.
[1:07:39] Too much thinking
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; too much remove that nothing is
[1:07:44] impossible to God.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; If you think I'm preaching a prosperity,
[1:07:52] it's in the message
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; and you will be shocked even today.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; You who are spiritual.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. and stay there that yourself.
[1:08:09] Let's go to 1 Chronicle 12:32. Amen.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Sometime you talk to message believer,
[1:08:17] they act like they are in another world.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; In another world,
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; like they don't even eat.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; They don't even eat.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say true fellowship is
[1:08:29] around what?
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Around what?
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Did he say
[1:08:35] you don't know that quote? Yes.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Was it spiritual food?
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; It was water type of food.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; Do you see how you acting?
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; So when we come to your house, put food.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; And then let's begin to talk about the
[1:08:51] word
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; because men shall not live by bread
[1:08:54] alone, but by every let's have both.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; The brother is stopping in your house.
[1:09:01] He's already tired and hungry. Give him
[1:09:03] some food.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; You keep going. THE SEVEN SEAL WAS OPEN.
[1:09:06] HEY, GIVE SOME FOOD CALLED DOOR DASH.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; AND THEN LET'S CONTINUE WITH THE SEVEN
[1:09:13] SEAL.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; AH, get on the seven seal with food
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; message believe. What's wrong? BE
[1:09:19] NORMAL.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; We have a wonderful fellowship. We have
[1:09:28] a Come on.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Uh don't worry. We will continue to work
[1:09:35] with you.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Until you are a man of like passion.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; But when you pray,
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; God shut the heaven.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter]
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; 1 Chronicle 12:32.
[1:09:53] You know this scripture. If you there,
[1:09:55] you can say amen.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you, my brother. And the children
[1:09:58] of what?
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; It's a car. which were men that had
[1:10:02] understanding of time. You might be
[1:10:05] seated.
[1:10:07] The children of Issach, you already know
[1:10:09] this clearly.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; They were men that have understanding
[1:10:15] of what
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; the times
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; of times
[1:10:19] correctly of season
[1:10:23] and what
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; to know what Israel ought to do.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; And they knew what to do.
[1:10:32] Amen. So number one, you must discern
[1:10:35] the time
[1:10:37] or discern the season. Are we together?
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; And after discerning the season, you
[1:10:42] need to know what to do
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; in that season.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Because if you just discern the season,
[1:10:49] what does he mean?
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; That's why some of you are still calm.
[1:10:53] You have not make some move yet.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. You didn't see the water that is
[1:10:59] trouble. [laughter]
[1:11:01] When the angel is troubling the water,
[1:11:04] it doesn't mean you sitting THERE YOU
[1:11:06] SAY, "WOW, [screaming]
[1:11:07] LOOK AT THAT WATER that is troubling."
[1:11:09] No, indeed you need to jump in the
[1:11:11] water.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; So the wisdom of Isaka, you need to know
[1:11:16] to understand to discern the season and
[1:11:20] know WHAT TO DO IN THAT SEASON.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Because if YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT to
[1:11:25] do in that season, YOU WILL MISS THE
[1:11:27] SEASON.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; If you know that it's harvest and you
[1:11:30] don't know what to do, you will miss
[1:11:31] everything that you need to gather in
[1:11:33] the harvest. Amen.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; So, you need to know the season and know
[1:11:37] what to do.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; If we will get there, I put another one,
[1:11:44] a question mark right there. We will
[1:11:46] find something there. The Bible say and
[1:11:48] know what to do that the heads of them
[1:11:51] were what? 200
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; and all the brethren were what?
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; At their commandment.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Let's go to Proverbs 6
[1:11:59] again.
[1:12:01] You're moving quickly with the scripture
[1:12:02] today. You're doing very good.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:12:12] Amen.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; If you there, you can say amen.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Proverbs 6 verse 6. Somebody got
[1:12:26] it already.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; The Bible say go to who?
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; The end.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; If you don't if you miss what God is
[1:12:36] saying in this church, that is your
[1:12:38] problem. Go to who?
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; The end.
[1:12:42] Feeble people. But they got a wisdom of
[1:12:44] God right there.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said go to the end. So God put
[1:12:49] his wisdom in the end. That's why the
[1:12:51] ant operate the way they operate. It's a
[1:12:53] divine wisdom. The Bible say go to the
[1:12:55] ant you who
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; slugger.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; So they're talking about a lazy person,
[1:12:59] a sloful lazy which is the anointing in
[1:13:02] Laisha.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; You lazy, you slagger and consider its
[1:13:07] ways and be water.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; In other words, go copy.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Go to the ant, observe what the ant is
[1:13:16] doing and do what the ant is doing.
[1:13:19] Learn the wisdom of the ant. Not just to
[1:13:22] learn it, but put it into work. Put it
[1:13:25] into action. Apply the wisdom that you
[1:13:29] are learning from the ant.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Because the ant is successful.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "And go to the ant you
[1:13:37] slagger. Consider its ways and be wise."
[1:13:41] Which have what?
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; No guide
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; or what?
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Overseer
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; or what?
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Ruler. So the ant have nobody to
[1:13:48] supervise them.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; No supervision. In other words, there's
[1:13:55] no boss.
[1:13:58] Amen.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; So they were normally prone to do
[1:14:01] whatever they want to do.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Because nobody's there to ask you for
[1:14:06] some accountability.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; So no one, it's my own work. I come to
[1:14:10] work whenever I want. I go to work
[1:14:12] whenever I want. If I don't want to go
[1:14:13] to work, I just
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; call in. I don't go to work because
[1:14:17] nobody's caring.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; But that's not with the eight.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that no guide, no
[1:14:22] overseer or ruler, verse eight, provide
[1:14:26] her meat when
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; in the summer
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; and gather her food when
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; in the harvest.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; We found out that the ant uses summer
[1:14:33] and fall.
[1:14:37] summer and fall.
[1:14:39] Not only to leave.
[1:14:42] Amen.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Not only to leave but to store,
[1:14:48] to save
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; or to lay in.
[1:14:52] Amen.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; So when this season comes, the end
[1:14:57] number one understand the season. Number
[1:15:00] two, not only understand or discern the
[1:15:03] season they get into. They know what to
[1:15:05] do that this is the only opportunity
[1:15:08] they can prevent the disaster in the
[1:15:10] future because winter is coming down the
[1:15:13] road. Amen.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; And I read this a lot and I'm going to
[1:15:16] read this again because there is a
[1:15:18] purpose if we can get to where we going.
[1:15:21] BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS sometime we find
[1:15:24] oursel prone to do what?
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; Run from work.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; We don't want to we don't want to work.
[1:15:29] Some people just think they can make
[1:15:31] their living water
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; without working.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; But I think Solomon it was that said we
[1:15:37] could find here the answer in watching
[1:15:39] water.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; So the answer of not of working is in
[1:15:44] the end.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; In other word an ant is a true worker.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; So ant are workers.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Because they send the lazy men
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; to go to the ant.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. to go to those that are working.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; And not just working, but they're
[1:16:03] working with objective.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; They're working with a plan. Yes, sir.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; They're working knowing what they're
[1:16:10] doing.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE WORKING TARGETING SOMETHING.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; They're working WITH A FORESIGHT.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE NOT JUST GOING TO WORK AND GET A
[1:16:19] PAYCHECK and that's it.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; No, they are working with plan.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; THEY ARE WORKING FOR THEIR FUTURE.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THEY ARE WORKING FOR THEIR OWN
[1:16:28] COMING SEASON.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; THEY WANT TO MAKE THEIR FUTURE EASIER
[1:16:32] AND BETTER.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Are we clear together?
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham continue. He says, you
[1:16:41] know, a little ant they tell me that if
[1:16:44] any every ant does not work work and
[1:16:47] laying that that ant does not eat that
[1:16:50] winter either. So everybody got to do
[1:16:52] what?
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; Work. So the ant not only is a worker
[1:16:55] but it's a disciplined creature.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; If you don't eat,
[1:17:04] they don't give you food. If you don't
[1:17:07] work, I'm sorry, they don't give you
[1:17:09] food.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; So you can come with all your religious
[1:17:12] stuff. The ant will say no.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; You can come everywhere you want to. You
[1:17:23] say, "Brother, you see what is going
[1:17:25] on?" And the end say, "No, brother. I
[1:17:27] don't have anything to give it to you.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; That brother is mean.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; That sister is mean.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; No, it's not a mean brother or a mean
[1:17:37] sister. It's a it's a it's a ant
[1:17:40] brother.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Are we together?"
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; It's an ant sister. a brother that knows
[1:17:49] how to discipline you.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; If not, you will continue to do the same
[1:17:53] thing over and over.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together? AMEN.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE GOT PARASITE IN THE MESSAGE.

[1:18:22] PROJECT FROM YOUR BACK. [cheering]
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; I don't know where that is coming from
[1:18:29] but I have to deliver.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; WHEN THEY WANT TO ATTEND A PROJECT THEY
[1:18:34] ARE WORKING A PROJECT BASED ON THE
[1:18:36] CHURCH.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; HOW MUCH PEOPLE ARE IN THE CHURCH? HOW
[1:18:40] MANY PEOPLE WILL CONTRIBUTE
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; OR HOW MUCH PEOPLE ARE IN THAT CHURCH
[1:18:45] AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT THEY BEGIN TO GO
[1:18:47] FROM ONE CHURCH TO ONE ANOTHER AND
[1:18:50] COLLECT THE PEOPLE NUMBER BECAUSE THEY
[1:18:52] DON'T WANT TO WORK.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; I seen THIS EVEN AMONG MINISTERS
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; THEY ARE COLLECTING BELIEVERS NUMBER ALL
[1:19:03] OVER THE UNITED STATES.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together?

[1:19:41] to hear about I don't want to depend on
[1:19:44] your amen. SAY AMEN OVER HERE. THEY TAKE
[1:19:46] ONE PICTURE AND THEY GO AROUND WITH ONE
[1:19:48] PICTURE AND IT GOES FROM ONE PASTOR TO
[1:19:51] ANOTHER AND ONE PASTOR TO ANOTHER AND
[1:19:53] THEY MAKE A COLLECTION.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; BUT THE TIME HAS COME
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; FOR PEOPLE to be disciplined.

[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; and let everybody else blessing come

[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; In Genesis 18, he was not the form of
[1:44:46] the angel of the Lord. HE WAS GOD
[1:44:48] HIMSELF IN HUMAN FORM.

[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; To the second he gave what?
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; Two.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; And to another he gave what?
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; One.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; And every man, ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; ACCORDING TO WHAT?
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; His several ability.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; In other word, ACCORDING TO HIS OWN
[1:55:27] ABILITY.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; I hope WE TOGETHER.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN GOD GIVES
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; THIS MONEY HERE THAT WAS given
[1:55:41] A talent.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; A talent
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; in the Bible.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; A talent in the Bible.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; One talent
[1:55:52] equals 6,000
[1:55:55] salary of a day.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you get me.
[1:56:02] SO YOU TAKE THE PAY of one day, you
[1:56:05] multiply that by 6,000. That's one
[1:56:08] talent.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; So if THIS MAN RECEIVE FIVE TALENT,
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; IT MEANS THAT GOD GAVE HIM 30,000.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; I hope we are TOGETHER NOW.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY I SAY THIS MAN GOT MONEY.
[1:56:31] WE WILL GET TO THAT.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; Don't worry. We will get to that.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; HE'S A RICH MAN.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; THIS MAN IS A RICH MAN.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; DON'T WORRY. I WILL GET TO THAT.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT GOING NOWHERE. IF YOU FINISH,
[1:56:48] YOU CLOSE THE DOOR SO NOBODY GOES. YOU
[1:56:50] You handed that. THIS MAN GOT MONEY.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? AMEN. FOLLOW ME
[1:56:56] CLEARLY. ARE WE TOGETHER? AND HE GAVE
[1:56:58] EACH one according to what?
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; Several abilities.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; According to his own. That word several
[1:57:04] means own.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; According to his own what?
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; Ability.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; ABILITY. SO WHEN GOD GIVE,
[1:57:13] GOD ALREADY KNEW THE ABILITY IN YOU.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; Can you help me please?
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, THE TALENT OF GOD HAD A
[1:57:24] MESSAGE. AMEN.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; THE TALENT HAD A MESSAGE.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE WAS YOU GOT THE ABILITY
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; TO DO IT.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; I hope we ARE TOGETHER.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.

[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; THEY GAVE HIM ACCORDING TO WHAT?
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; Seven ability.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; SO THERE WAS AN ABILITY
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE MONEY THAT WAS GIVEN THE
[1:57:52] TOTAL IS ETERNITY.
[1:57:57] AMEN.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.

[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; SO THIS MONEY ALREADY HAVE MONEY
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; THAT NEEDED TO BE MANIFESTED.
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; I hope WE ARE TOGETHER.

[1:58:19] RIGHT. [applause]
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; GOD GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRING IT
[1:58:26] OUT.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; The master COULD HAVE DONE HIS OWN
[1:58:35] investment
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; and BRING EVERYTHING OUT BUT HE CALL

[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, GOD HAS CERTAIN THINGS
[1:59:00] THAT HE WANT TO FULFILL
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; BUT HE WANT TO FULFILL IT THROUGH YOU.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together?

[1:59:32] longer on the bus,
[1:59:36] [cheering]
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; BUT THE WORK HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED

[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; IN WHOM GOD HAVE A TRUST.

[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; THE PROBLEM WAS IT WAS AN OPENING OF A
[2:01:00] NEW SEASON FOR WORK.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; Get the money. And notice verse 15. THE
[2:01:10] BIBLE SAY, "AND to one he gave what?"
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; Five talents.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; And to another he gave what?
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; Two.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; And to another he gave what?

[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; Everybody according to what?
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; His several abilities.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; AND IMMEDIATELY
[2:01:23] WHAT DID he do?
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; TOOK HIS JOURNEY.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; SO THAT SEASON IS A SEASON WHEN THE BOSS
[2:01:29] IS PHYSICALLY ABSENT.

[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE WISDOM OF AN ANT IS THEY ARE
[2:01:55] WORKING WITHOUT THE BOSS PRESENT.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; WITHOUT THE SUPERVISOR.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; SO THE ONE WHO GAVE THE MONEY LEAVE.
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; IT'S A SEASON WITHOUT SUPERVISION.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. AMEN.
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; SO YOU NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL.

[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; IT'S A SEASON WHERE WHEREVER WHATEVER
[2:02:29] YOU WILL MANIFEST, THE BOSS WILL NOT BE
[2:02:32] PHYSICALLY PRESENT.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; And the boss is who?
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; God.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; So, IT'S A SEASON WHERE GOD IS NOT
[2:02:43] PHYSICALLY PRESENT.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; GOD WAS PHYSICALLY PRESENT IN THE MAN
[2:02:48] JESUS CHRIST.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; BUT JESUS CHRIST SAY I GO TO MY FATHER.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN JESUS GOES TO THE FATHER,
[2:02:55] ANOTHER SEASON OPEN UP
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; WHERE THE RESPONSIBILITY IS GIVEN TO THE
[2:03:01] CHURCH.
[2:03:06] Are we together?
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; IT IS TO THE CHURCH
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; TO CARRY THE BUSINESS OF THE FATHER.
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE FATHER IS ABSENT,
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; WHEN JESUS IS NOT THERE PHYSICALLY, THE
[2:03:20] CHURCH MUST CARRY THE FATHER BUSINESS.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; It's a season of work. It's a season
[2:03:32] without supervision.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; It's a season of prosperity.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; It is a season of blessing.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; Because the boss KNEW THAT NOBODY WILL
[2:03:49] FAIL.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; WHEN HE GAVE HIS INVESTMENT, HE'S A GOOD
[2:03:58] INVESTOR. HE ALREADY KNOW NOBODY WILL
[2:04:01] FAIL. EVERYBODY WILL PRODUCE 100.
[2:04:12] AMEN.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; You who want me to go back to the
[2:04:15] spiritual, let me go back to the
[2:04:16] spiritual because I will be navigating
[2:04:18] natural physical. Natural physical. Are
[2:04:20] we together? The boss knew that whatever
[2:04:24] he invested in you,
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; you won't fail.
[2:04:31] Are we together?
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; THE WHATEVER GOD PUT IN YOU, GOD won't
[2:04:34] fail.
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; IT MUST PRODUCE. EXACTLY. IN OTHER WORD,
[2:04:39] YOU ALREADY HAVE THE BLESSING OF GOD,
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; THE FAVOR OF GOD,
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; THE PROTECTION OF GOD TO MAKE SURE HIS
[2:04:48] INVESTMENT DOESN'T FAIL.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF YOU FAIL,
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; HE JUDGES YOU WRONG.
[2:04:56] YOU DIDN'T GET ME well
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; if you fail
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; because he gave according to his own to
[2:05:04] their own ability.
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; If you fail, so his judgment was wrong.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; YOUR FAILURE IS AN INSULT TO HIS
[2:05:12] JUDGMENT.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; BUT THE JUDGMENT OF GOD CANNOT BE
[2:05:16] INSULTED.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; GOD IS ALWAYS RIGHT.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; WHATEVER HE CHOOSE,
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; HE CHOOSES THE BEST.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:05:25] AMEN.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; SO IF GOD ENTRUSTED YOU SOMETHING,
[2:05:32] [cheering]
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; GOD ALREADY TRUSTING YOU MORE THAN YOU
[2:05:35] TRUST ON YOURSELF.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; You didn't get ME WELL. SO MY MESSAGE
[2:05:41] TODAY IS DON'T TRUST YOURSELF
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; THE WAY YOU THINKING.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; TRUST YOURSELF BASED ON THE TRUST GOD
[2:05:51] HAD FOR YOU.
[2:05:56] ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; IF GOD ELECTED [screaming] ME TO BE A
[2:06:01] PASTOR HERE,
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; THEN I KNOW BASED ON GOD THAT THERE GOT
[2:06:05] TO BE SOMETHING IN ME.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; SO I'M NOT GOING TO TRUST ON MYSELF. I'M
[2:06:11] TRUSTING ON HIM
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HIS CHURCH ARE PERFECT.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together?
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; Job 2 verse 16.
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; Then he that receiveth what?
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; The five talents
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; went and do what?
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; Traded with the same.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; So somebody went to work.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; Somebody begin to work.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; Begin to work with and traded the same
[2:06:42] and made what
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; them other five talents.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; So the five produces five. So he
[2:06:48] doubled. He got 100% return.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; You know this.
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; Go ahead my friend. And what?
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; And likewise he that had received two.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; He also gained two.
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; Please follow me very care. Let's let's
[2:07:01] stay focused. Okay.
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. Let's limit the movement. Let's
[2:07:05] go. He that have two did what?
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; Received other also gained other two.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; He gain also two. Right.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; He gained two by working.
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO THE FIRST MAN WORK
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; WHEN HE WORK he produce.
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; THE SECOND MAN WORK AND HE PRODUCE.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; But let's see the third man.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; Let's go with the third who insulted
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; the judgment of the of the creator.
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; But he that had received one
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; went and digged in the earth.
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; He went and did what?
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; Digged in the earth.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; And hid HIS LORD'S MONEY. HE ALSO DID
[2:07:47] SOME WORK.
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; Am I reading A DIFFERENT BIBLE?
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; HE ALSO DID SOME WORK.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; BUT THE WORK HE DID DIDN'T PRODUCE
[2:08:03] ANYTHING.
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; HE ALSO SPENT SOME ENERGY
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; ON SOMETHING THAT IS UNPRODUCTIVE.
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:08:17] YOU didn't get me well.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; It's still coming down.
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; THE LAZY PERSON IS NOT REALLY MESSY.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; A LAZY PERSON OR ADULTNESS USUALLY GOES
[2:08:36] WITH ANOTHER BUSY
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; BUT BUSY IN UNPRODUCTIVE WORK.
[2:08:43] AMEN.
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me well. I'm going to put
[2:08:47] it again.
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; HE SPENDED ENERGY.
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; HE SPARED WORK.
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; BUT WHATEVER he was doing was not
[2:08:55] producing anything.
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; Whatever he WAS DOING WAS ONLY BEARING
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; BEARING THE TALENT.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; SO GOD [screaming] CALL HIM A LAZY.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; AND A WICKED ONE. SO A LAZY PERSON
[2:09:13] DOESN'T MEAN JUST HE'S NOT WORKING. HE'S
[2:09:17] NOT DOING WHAT HE'S SUPPOSED TO DO,
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; BUT HE'S DOING SOMETHING ELSE.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; HE'S BUSY WITH THINGS THAT ARE
[2:09:26] UNPRODUCTIVE. [screaming]
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; WATCH WHAT YOU DOING IN YOUR LIFE.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; WATCH WHAT YOU SPENDING TIME WITH.
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS HE PRODUCING?
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; I hope we ARE TOGETHER.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; If you go to the third person, you will
[2:09:49] see him sweating.
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; You say, "What are you doing?" I'm also
[2:09:53] doing some work.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; But when you ask him, YOU SAY, "WHAT DID
[2:09:58] YOU GET?"
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; The work he did was to hide the talent
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; so he can get a free time.
[2:10:11] TO GO MIND ANY OTHER BUSINESS OTHER THAN
[2:10:15] THE FATHER'S BUSINESS.
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; SO HIS WORK WAS ONLY TAKING HIM AWAY
[2:10:25] FROM THE COMMISSION,
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; AWAY FROM THE COMMANDMENT,
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; AWAY FROM THE WORD OF THE BOSS.
[2:10:34] THE WORD WAS BE GET TO WORK.
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; BUT HIS WORK TAKE HIM OFF THE PATH.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; So when everybody else was busy working,
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; he didn't have anything to do.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; HE WAS JUST CHILLING OUT
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; UNDER THE PRETENSE OF BEING CAUTIOUS.
[2:11:00] [applause]
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; You didn't get ME WELL.
[2:11:03] HE HAS A REASON WHEN YOU ASK HIM WHY YOU
[2:11:07] DON'T WORK. NO, NO, NO. I DON'T WANT TO
[2:11:08] LOSE the money.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; SO, HE'S APPEARING TO BE CAUTIOUS,
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S NOT REALLY CAUTIOUS. HE'S a
[2:11:15] lazy man.
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; BUT HE'S COVERING HIS LAZINESS BY
[2:11:20] CAUTIOUSNESS.
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; IF SOMEBODY NEEDED TO BE CAUTIOUS, WHO
[2:11:29] SHOULD BE MORE CAUTIOUS?
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; HIM OR THE FACT?
[2:11:32] BUT THE FIVE TALENT TOOK RISK.
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. AMEN.
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; THE TWO TALENT TOOK RISK.
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; BUT THE ONE THAT HAVE THE LIST IS THE
[2:11:42] ONE THAT IS WORRYING MORE.
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; I hope WE ARE TOGETHER.
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAYS I FEAR.
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; SO FEAR. THAT'S WHY BROTHER BRANDHAM
[2:11:55] PREACH ALL THE TIME. FEAR NOT. BE NOT
[2:11:57] AFRAID. BE NOT AFRAID. BECAUSE FEAR IS A
[2:11:59] CURSE.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. AMEN.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; AND BEING AFRAID TO PUT THE COMMANDMENT
[2:12:05] OF GOD IN ACTION, IT'S A TROUBLE.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; We clear?
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; Let's jump my friend.

[2:12:27] to be a what?
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; A long time. That's right.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; So from the going of the master to the
[2:12:32] return of the master, it's a long time.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. Amen.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; So there is a going of the master AND A
[2:12:41] COMING BACK OF THE MASTER.
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; In between the going and the coming
[2:12:46] back, it's a long time.
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; In other words, THERE IS A SEASON.
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; THERE IS A PERIOD OF TIME.
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; WHERE THE MASTER WON'T BE THERE.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; We clear.
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. We clear?
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; The Bible says after a long time, THE
[2:13:03] LORD OF THOSE SERVANT did what?
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; Come in.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; And reckon with them. In other word, ask
[2:13:09] them to settle their account.
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says this BEFORE WE SAW.
[2:13:14] HE SAYS NOW BECAUSE WE HAVE WHAT?
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; A RESPONSIBILITY
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; THAT WE GOT TO ANSWER TO GOD SOMEDAY
[2:13:21] FOR.
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; EVERY MAN THAT COME ON THE FACE OF THE
[2:13:25] EARTH HAS TO DO WHAT? answers to God
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; for a responsibility.

[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; Too many of us a stewardship WE HAVE TO
[2:13:36] ANSWER FOR. THIS RESPONSIBILITY IS A
[2:13:39] STEWARDSHIP THAT HAS BEEN COMMITTED TO
[2:13:41] US BY WHO?
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; GOD.
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE WHAT IT IS.
[2:13:46] &gt;&gt; When we read this like this, we usually
[2:13:48] put this in men.
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; Especially preacher. We'll put that in
[2:13:53] the pastor or the deacon or the trustee.
[2:13:56] We say you the one that got
[2:13:57] responsibility. God will tell you what
[2:13:59] to do. But let's continue WITH BROTHER
[2:14:01] BRHAM. BROTHER BRHAM SAY AS I SAID A FEW
[2:14:05] MOMENT A WHAT?

[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; Whatever it is that God HAS PUT YOU TO
[2:14:21] DO,
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT A STEWARDSHIP TO DO THAT. TO
[2:14:25] THAT YOU GOT TO ANSWER TO GOD FOR
[2:14:28] BECAUSE HE TAKE ALL THESE THINGS TO WHAT
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; TO do it.
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; So at the end of the day we got to
[2:14:34] answer before God.
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; Are we clear so far? Amen.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; Let's continue my friend. JOB TO VERSE

[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; five talents
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; and brought water
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; other five talents.
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; He says Lord YOU DELIVER THE FIVE
[2:14:48] TALENT. Behold I have gained beside them
[2:14:51] water
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; five talents more. SO IF GOD GAVE HIM
[2:14:54] 30,000,
[2:14:56] how much did he gain?
[2:14:59] 30,000 more. So how much does he have
[2:15:02] now?
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; We clear.
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; This is the salary of a day.
[2:15:11] Look at how much you make a day.
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me where? Look at how
[2:15:16] much you make in one day.
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; Can you give me a salary for one day?
[2:15:21] Just pick one.
[2:15:23] 92.
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; Okay. 200.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; Okay. Let's go. 92. You were the first
[2:15:29] one. Okay. $92. Take 92 times 30,000.

[2:15:55] &gt;&gt; Two
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; seven.
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; Seven.

[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; 0 0.
[2:16:07] That is the beginning.
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; That is the beginning that the boss
[2:16:13] gave.
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; The boss gave how much?
[2:16:17] 700.
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; So double that. How much did he get?
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; Multiply by two.
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; We took $92. We didn't take a 100
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; because if you make $500 a day, it's a
[2:16:30] problem. Continue. Multiply that by two
[2:16:32] is what?
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; Just spell the number.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; 5520.
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

[2:19:38] &gt;&gt; IF YOU GO TO GOD, YOU SAY YOU GIVE HIM
[2:19:40] FIVE. GOD SAY IT'S FEW THINGS.
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; You give him two, it's few things.
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; YOU GAVE HIM ONE, IT'S FEW THINGS

[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; THAT IS DRINKING. Brother say that and
[2:20:16] and and THE FISH IS SAYING LET ME DRINK
[2:20:19] SLOWLY BECAUSE I'M GOING TO FINISH THE

[2:20:28] EATING SLOWLY BEING AFRAID HE'S GOING TO
[2:20:30] FINISH THE GARDENER. YOU WILL NEVER
[2:20:33] EXHAUST GOD.
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY GOD SAY ASK ABUNDANTLY.
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. IF I ASK HIM FOR
[2:20:49] A HEADACHE, I'M GOING TO ASK HIM FOR A
[2:20:51] SCRATCH.
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; WHATEVER IS GOING ON IN MY BODY, I WILL
[2:20:54] CONTINUE TO ASK BECAUSE IT'S ALL A FEW
[2:20:57] THINGS.
[2:20:59] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:21:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:21:04] &gt;&gt; Job, my friend. Job, my friend. To verse
[2:21:06] uh 24. I'm about to finish my s my my
[2:21:10] reading. Then he which had received
[2:21:12] what?
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; The one talent
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; he says what? Lord,
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; I knew iniquity.
[2:21:18] Continue. I knew
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; that thou art in hard man.
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; So he already know that the boss was a
[2:21:23] strict man.
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; He was a disciplined man.
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; You remember that?
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; You were a hard man doing what?
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; Reaping where thou has not sown.
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; SO THE BOSS WILL NOT SOW. The boss gave
[2:21:35] you give you the responsibility to work.
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; He's just coming to reap.
[2:21:40] &gt;&gt; So work is your privilege. Amen.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; The work that I DO, THE WORK THAT I do,
[2:21:46] you shall DO IT ALSO. WORK is a
[2:21:48] privilege.
[2:21:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; You are reaping where you didn't sow or
[2:21:54] doing water
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; and gathering where thou hast NOT
[2:21:56] STRONG.
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; AND I WAS WHAT?
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; AFRAID
[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; AND WENT AND DID WHAT?
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; Hid thy talent in THE EARTH.
[2:22:02] &gt;&gt; SO, LORD, THERE IS WATER.
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; THOU HAST that is thine.
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; Continue verse 26.
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; His lord answered and said unto him,
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; you
[2:22:10] &gt;&gt; thou wicked and slothful. So without
[2:22:11] putting God's money into action, it's a
[2:22:15] wickedness.
[2:22:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; Without putting the faith of God in
[2:22:18] action, it's a wickedness.
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:21] &gt;&gt; I'm reading the Bible.
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; The Bible say you are wicked and what?
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; And slothful.
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; In other words, LAZY. HE DIDN'T WANT TO
[2:22:27] WORK.
[2:22:28] &gt;&gt; IT'S AN EXCUSE NOT TO WORK.
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS SLOTHFUL SERVANT. YOU KNEW THAT
[2:22:34] I DO WHAT?
[2:22:34] &gt;&gt; I REAP WHERE I sow not.
[2:22:36] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:22:36] &gt;&gt; And gather where I have not straw. VERSE
[2:22:38] 27, HE GAVE HIM ANOTHER OPTION.
[2:22:42] IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO WORK, THIS IS WHAT
[2:22:44] YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO DO.
[2:22:47] &gt;&gt; IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO DO WORK, YOU
[2:22:49] SHOULD HAVE INVESTED.
[2:22:51] &gt;&gt; I HOPE SOME WE are somewhere.
[2:22:53] &gt;&gt; VERSE 27, YOU OUGHT THEREFORE TO HAVE DO
[2:22:56] WHAT?
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; Put my money to THE EXCHANGERS. AND THEN
[2:22:59] AT THE AT MY COMING, THE coming of the
[2:23:03] Lord,
[2:23:05] &gt;&gt; the coming of the Lord, the Lord will be
[2:23:07] coming
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; because THIS MAN IS GOD. AT MY COMING, I
[2:23:11] SHOULD RECEIVE WHAT?
[2:23:12] &gt;&gt; Mine own WITH USER.
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; SO THE BOSS WAS COMING TO RECEIVE
[2:23:16] INTEREST.
[2:23:18] &gt;&gt; SO GOD WHEN HE COME TO PICK UP HIS
[2:23:21] BREAD,
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; HE MUST NOT FIND AN EMPTY BREAD.
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; YES SIR.
[2:23:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:23:28] AMEN.
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me well.
[2:23:31] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me well. IF THE LORD LEFT
[2:23:34] YOU WITH FIVE,
[2:23:35] &gt;&gt; WHEN HE COMES, YOU MUST HAVE 10.
[2:23:38] &gt;&gt; WHATEVER STATE THE LORD LEFT YOU, WHEN
[2:23:41] THE LORD COMES, YOU MUST BE BETTER THAN
[2:23:43] THE STATE YOU WERE LEFT.
[2:23:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; THE BRIDE MUST BE BETTER THAN WHAT THE
[2:23:48] LORD LEFT THE BRIDE.
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.

[2:24:30] bringing forth families
[2:24:32] &gt;&gt; this is a life of the season of mortal
[2:24:34] life.
[2:24:34] &gt;&gt; So we got mortal life and we got what
[2:24:37] &gt;&gt; continue.
[2:24:38] &gt;&gt; But when we have been born of above
[2:24:40] &gt;&gt; the body returns to dust from where it
[2:24:42] come
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; and the spirit goes down to where it
[2:24:44] come from or goes up rather to where it
[2:24:47] come from. to God who gave it. And there
[2:24:50] will come another season.
[2:24:51] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. And that season that will come
[2:24:53] will be what?
[2:24:54] &gt;&gt; The immortal season.
[2:24:55] &gt;&gt; SO WE HAVE A MORTAL season and an
[2:24:58] immortal season. AND RIGHT NOW EVERYBODY

[2:25:25] &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER.
[2:25:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:25:27] &gt;&gt; AND HERE WE FOUND OUT THAT ACCORDING TO
[2:25:29] MARK 10, the Bible say that then Jesus
[2:25:32] says what?
[2:25:33] &gt;&gt; Beholding him.
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; He did what?
[2:25:35] &gt;&gt; Loved him.
[2:25:35] &gt;&gt; The rich young muhul he says unto him,
[2:25:38] ONE THING THOU LACKEST. WHAT DO YOU DO?

[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; THE POOR. AND THOU SHALL HAVE TREASURE
[2:25:46] WHERE

[2:25:47] &gt;&gt; SO DURING THE MOTOR SEASON WHEN YOU GIVE
[2:25:51] TO THE poor
[2:25:53] &gt;&gt; heaven.
[2:25:54] &gt;&gt; WE CLEAR.
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.

[2:26:04] &gt;&gt; IN HEAVEN BECAUSE RIGHT NOW [screaming]
[2:26:06] YOU ARE NOT LIVING IN HEAVEN YET.
[2:26:11] [laughter]
[2:26:13] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE SAYS, "THOU SHALL HAVE TREASURE
[2:26:16] WHERE
[2:26:16] &gt;&gt; IN HEAVEN."
[2:26:17] &gt;&gt; SO IN HEAVEN THERE IS A BANK.
[2:26:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:26:22] &gt;&gt; I know it's hard FOR YOU

[2:26:28] &gt;&gt; We getting somewhere.
[2:26:30] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; PAUL SAYS, [screaming]
[2:26:33] I MEAN JESUS SAYS THIS, "BUT WHEN THOU
[2:26:36] MAKEST WATER,
[2:26:36] &gt;&gt; A FEAST,
[2:26:37] &gt;&gt; CALL WHO?
[2:26:38] &gt;&gt; THE POOR
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; AND THE WATER,
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; the lame
[2:26:40] &gt;&gt; and the water."
[2:26:40] &gt;&gt; The lame
[2:26:41] &gt;&gt; and the what?
[2:26:42] &gt;&gt; THE BLIND.
[2:26:42] &gt;&gt; JOB. AND THAT SHALL BE WHAT?
[2:26:45] &gt;&gt; BLESSED.
[2:26:45] &gt;&gt; FOR THEY CANNOT DO WHAT?
[2:26:47] &gt;&gt; RECOMPENS
[2:26:48] &gt;&gt; FOR THAT SHALL BE RECOMPENSEED WHERE?
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; AT THE RESURRECTION OF the just.
[2:26:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:53] &gt;&gt; At the what?
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; At the REC RESURRECTION OF THE
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; RESURRECTION OF THE JUST IS WHEN OUR
[2:26:59] MORTAL BODY BECOME IMMORTAL.
[2:27:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.

[2:27:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:27:04] &gt;&gt; SO WHATEVER WE DOING NOW IS HAVING AN
[2:27:07] EFFECT ON THE FUTURE.
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:27:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT PROVERB SAYS THIS. SOLOMON
[2:27:14] SAYS THAT HE THAT HAVE PITY UPON WHAT?
[2:27:17] &gt;&gt; THE POOR.
[2:27:18] &gt;&gt; HE DOES WHAT?
[2:27:19] &gt;&gt; Lendeth unto the Lord.
[2:27:20] &gt;&gt; UNTO THE LORD THAT WHICH AND THAT WHICH
[2:27:23] HE HAS GIVEN, HE WILL DO WHAT?
[2:27:24] &gt;&gt; PAY HIM AGAIN.
[2:27:25] &gt;&gt; SO WE FOUND OUT THAT ACCORDING TO THE
[2:27:28] PROVERB, THERE IS NOT ONLY A LAYING OFF
[2:27:31] TO THE FUTURE, THERE IS ALSO A LAW OF
[2:27:35] RETURN.
[2:27:38] &gt;&gt; YES.
[2:27:39] &gt;&gt; ON THIS EARTH.
[2:27:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[2:27:42] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:27:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:27:43] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU GIVING TO THE POOR,
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE ACTUALLY LENDING TO GOD.
[2:27:48] &gt;&gt; AND GOD IS IS WORKING TWO WAYS.
[2:27:52] &gt;&gt; NUMBER ONE, HE'S REPAYING YOU BACK
[2:27:54] [screaming] ON EARTH.
[2:27:56] &gt;&gt; AND NUMBER TWO, HE'S ALSO LAYING THINGS
[2:27:58] FOR YOU ON THE FUTURE.
[2:28:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:28:01] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:28:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:28:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE BIBLE SAYS THIS AGAIN IN LUKE
[2:28:06] 6. GIVE any water
[2:28:09] &gt;&gt; shall be GIVEN UNTO YOU.
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; HOW
[2:28:11] &gt;&gt; GOOD MEASURE
[2:28:12] &gt;&gt; DO WHAT?
[2:28:13] &gt;&gt; PRESSED DOWN
[2:28:13] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT
[2:28:14] &gt;&gt; AND SHAKEN TOGETHER
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; AND
[2:28:16] &gt;&gt; AND RUNNING OVER
[2:28:17] &gt;&gt; SHALL MEN [screaming] GIVE UNTO WHAT?
[2:28:19] &gt;&gt; YOUR BOSOM.
[2:28:20] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:28:21] &gt;&gt; Give and it SHALL BE GIVEN BACK TO YOU.
[2:28:24] HOW A GOOD MEASURE. IN OTHER WORDS, WHEN
[2:28:27] YOU GIVE, WHEN GOD IS BRINGING BACK TO
[2:28:30] YOU, IT IS NOT JUST GIVING YOU. HE MUST
[2:28:33] BE PUT DOWN
[2:28:37] &gt;&gt; SHAKEN TOGETHER
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT?
[2:28:39] &gt;&gt; SHAKEN TOGETHER.
[2:28:40] &gt;&gt; AH,
[2:28:42] CAN WE READ IT TOGETHER?
[2:28:44] &gt;&gt; CAN WE GIVE IT TOGETHER?
[2:28:46] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU GIVE,
[2:28:47] &gt;&gt; YOU GIVE EASILY.
[2:28:49] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN IT'S TIME TO PAY YOU BACK,
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T COME THE WAY YOU GIVE.
[2:28:54] &gt;&gt; GOD SAY IT WILL COME A GOOD MEASURE.
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; THAT IS HOW PRESSED DOWN.
[2:29:00] &gt;&gt; SO THEY BRING IT. THEY SAY, "WHO IS IT?"
[2:29:02] BROTHER TRAMAN. They put it down. THEY
[2:29:04] SAY, "AH, IT'S NOT FINISHED." PRESS IT
[2:29:05] DOWN.
[2:29:06] &gt;&gt; AND AFTER YOU PRESS DOWN, WHAT DO YOU
[2:29:08] DO?
[2:29:08] &gt;&gt; SHAKE IT TOGETHER.
[2:29:09] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU SHAKE IT TOGETHER, SO HE SEE HE
[2:29:11] MAKES MORE ROOM.
[2:29:13] &gt;&gt; Are we together? [cheering]
[2:29:14] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? AND WHEN HE MAKE MORE
[2:29:17] ROOM, YOU FILL IT.
[2:29:18] &gt;&gt; AND HE MUST DO WHAT?
[2:29:20] &gt;&gt; RUN OVER.
[2:29:20] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY DAVID SAY, "MY CUP DOES WHAT?
[2:29:23] &gt;&gt; RUNTH OVER."
[2:29:24] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:29:28] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? SO WHEN YOU giving in
[2:29:31] the mortal
[2:29:33] um in the mortal season when you giving
[2:29:35] to the poor there is a law of return
[2:29:38] first on the earth
[2:29:40] &gt;&gt; before you die.
[2:29:41] &gt;&gt; God cannot owe you something.
[2:29:44] &gt;&gt; Because you LENDED TO GOD.
[2:29:46] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY GOD RETURN A
[2:29:48] THOUSANDFOLD.
[2:29:50] &gt;&gt; GOD MUST RETURN BACK TO YOU.
[2:29:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND WHEN HE RETURNED BACK TO YOU,
[2:29:56] YOU ALSO HAVE A DIVIDEND IN HEAVEN.
[2:29:59] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:30:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:30:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:03] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:30:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:30:04] &gt;&gt; I HOPE YOU GOING TO SWALLOW THIS. THAT'S
[2:30:06] WHY PAUL PUT IT ALL TOGETHER.
[2:30:09] &gt;&gt; YOU READY? PAUL SAY, "CHUDGE THEM THAT
[2:30:12] ARE WHAT?
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; RICH IN THIS WORLD
[2:30:14] &gt;&gt; IN THE MORTAL SEASON THAT THEY BE NOT
[2:30:16] WHAT?
[2:30:16] &gt;&gt; HIGH MINDED.
[2:30:17] &gt;&gt; WE DON'T WANT THEM TO BE PROUD NOR WHAT
[2:30:19] &gt;&gt; TRUST in uncertain riches
[2:30:21] &gt;&gt; like the rich young ruler, BUT IN THE
[2:30:23] WATER. THE LIVING GOD
[2:30:24] &gt;&gt; WHO GIVE US HOW?
[2:30:26] &gt;&gt; RICHLY
[2:30:26] &gt;&gt; WHAT?
[2:30:27] &gt;&gt; All things to enjoy.
[2:30:28] &gt;&gt; THE FIRST RESPONSIBILITY IS FOR YOU TO
[2:30:30] ENJOY.
[2:30:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:30:32] &gt;&gt; AND THEN [screaming] THAT THEY DO WHAT?
[2:30:34] &gt;&gt; GOOD.
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU DO GOOD TO THE POOR, GOD WILL
[2:30:38] REPAY YOU BACK AGAIN. [laughter]
[2:30:41] &gt;&gt; What I'm trying to show you here, it's a
[2:30:44] circle.
[2:30:47] &gt;&gt; You give
[2:30:48] &gt;&gt; God replenish back and put it in heaven.
[2:30:51] When God replenish back, you give again
[2:30:54] &gt;&gt; and God replenish back again and you add
[2:30:57] more in heaven.
[2:30:58] &gt;&gt; IT'S A CIRCLE. EVERY TIME YOU GIVE, HE
[2:31:01] COMES BACK and he deposit in heaven. IT
[2:31:04] COMES BACK AND then it deposit in HEAVEN
[2:31:06] IN. SO YOU ARE PROSPERING IN BOTH WAYS.
[2:31:10] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE PROSPERING ON THE EARTH AND YOU
[2:31:12] ARE ALSO PROSPERING IN HEAVEN.
[2:31:15] &gt;&gt; I KNOW WHERE I'm going, my friend.
[2:31:17] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? PAUL SAID THAT THEY DO
[2:31:19] WHAT?
[2:31:20] &gt;&gt; GOOD. THAT THEY BE THAT THEY BE RICH IN
[2:31:22] WHAT
[2:31:23] &gt;&gt; and good works.
[2:31:24] &gt;&gt; Ready to do what?
[2:31:25] &gt;&gt; DISTRIBUTE.
[2:31:25] &gt;&gt; AND WILLING TO DO WHAT?
[2:31:27] &gt;&gt; COMMUNICATE.
[2:31:27] &gt;&gt; LAYING UP IN STORE FOR THEMSEL A WHAT?
[2:31:31] &gt;&gt; A GOOD FOUNDATION
[2:31:33] &gt;&gt; AGAINST WHICH TIME?
[2:31:34] &gt;&gt; THE TIME TO COME.
[2:31:35] &gt;&gt; Not this time. Here.
[2:31:37] &gt;&gt; Whatever you doing in this time, you are
[2:31:40] laying a good foundation for the time to
[2:31:42] come.
[2:31:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:31:43] &gt;&gt; FOR THE IMMORTAL TIME. ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:31:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:31:46] &gt;&gt; THAT THEY MAY LAY HOLD OF WHAT? ON
[2:31:49] ETERNAL LIFE.
[2:31:50] &gt;&gt; MY QUESTION IS THIS. YOU WHO HAVE A hard
[2:31:53] time and was waiting for brother Brham.
[2:31:55] AMEN. MY QUESTION IS THIS. THE BIBLE
[2:31:58] SAYS HERE THAT BUT IN THE WHO
[2:32:01] &gt;&gt; LIVING GOD
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; WHO GIVE US HOW
[2:32:03] &gt;&gt; richly all things to enjoy.
[2:32:05] &gt;&gt; HOW CAN YOU GIVE RICHLY WHEN YOU ARE
[2:32:07] POOR?
[2:32:12] &gt;&gt; Can you answer my question so we move?
[2:32:19] UHOH.
[2:32:20] &gt;&gt; CAN YOU ANSWER MY QUESTION? HOW CAN YOU
[2:32:23] GIVE HOW?
[2:32:24] &gt;&gt; RICHLY.
[2:32:25] &gt;&gt; IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT.
[2:32:29] &gt;&gt; SO GOD [screaming] MUST BE HOW?
[2:32:31] &gt;&gt; RICH.
[2:32:33] &gt;&gt; Let go. Let go, MY FRIEND. GOD MUST BE
[2:32:36] HOW?
[2:32:36] &gt;&gt; RICH.
[2:32:37] &gt;&gt; TO BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU HOW?
[2:32:38] &gt;&gt; RICHLY.
[2:32:42] &gt;&gt; IF YOU HAVE A HARD TIME, SWALLOW THIS.
[2:32:45] THE BIBLE SAYS IN EPHESIANS 3 THAT HE
[2:32:49] WOULD GRANT YOU WHAT?
[2:32:51] &gt;&gt; According to the riches of his glory.
[2:32:53] &gt;&gt; ACCORDING TO WHAT?
[2:32:54] &gt;&gt; The riches of his glory.
[2:32:56] &gt;&gt; THE RICHES OF WHAT?
[2:32:57] &gt;&gt; HIS GLORY.
[2:32:58] &gt;&gt; THE RICHES OF WHAT?
[2:33:00] &gt;&gt; HIS GLORY.
[2:33:01] &gt;&gt; SO GOD IN HIS GLORY IS NOT POOR.
[2:33:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:33:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:33:07] &gt;&gt; I'm getting somewhere.
[2:33:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:33:09] &gt;&gt; I KNOW IT'S HARD TO SWALLOW.
[2:33:11] &gt;&gt; GOD WILL GIVE YOU ACCORDING TO WHAT? HIS
[2:33:14] RICHES IN GLORY.
[2:33:15] &gt;&gt; HIS RICHES OF WHAT?
[2:33:17] &gt;&gt; OF HIS GLORY.
[2:33:18] &gt;&gt; UH-UH. Not his riches in glory. Let's
[2:33:20] read it correctly.
[2:33:22] &gt;&gt; Let's read it correctly. Can we read it
[2:33:24] correctly?
[2:33:26] &gt;&gt; According
[2:33:28] that he will grant you, God will grant
[2:33:30] to you.
[2:33:31] &gt;&gt; God will give you.
[2:33:33] &gt;&gt; But he give you a certain way
[2:33:36] &gt;&gt; according to the riches of WATER
[2:33:39] &gt;&gt; HIS GLORY.
[2:33:40] &gt;&gt; SO GOD GOT RICHES.
[2:33:44] IN HIS GLORY.
[2:33:45] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN GOD GIVE YOU, HE GIVE YOU
[2:33:47] ACCORDING TO WHAT HE HAVE.
[2:33:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:33:50] &gt;&gt; I hope we are doing IT TOGETHER.
[2:33:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:33:52] &gt;&gt; ACCORDING TO THE RICHES OF HIS GLORY TO
[2:33:55] BE WHAT?
[2:33:56] &gt;&gt; STRENGTHENED
[2:33:56] &gt;&gt; WITH WHAT?
[2:33:57] &gt;&gt; WITH MIGHT.
[2:33:58] &gt;&gt; BY WHAT?
[2:33:58] &gt;&gt; HIS SPIRIT.
[2:33:59] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT?
[2:34:00] &gt;&gt; IN THE INNER MAN.
[2:34:01] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN GOD WANT [screaming] TO GIVE YOU
[2:34:03] SPIRITUAL THINGS,
[2:34:04] &gt;&gt; FOLLOW ME MY FRIEND. GOD GIVE YOU
[2:34:07] SPIRITUAL FAME ACCORDING TO HIS RICHES.
[2:34:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:34:11] &gt;&gt; IN GLORY. AMEN.
[2:34:14] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me. Well,
[2:34:17] &gt;&gt; Ephesians right here is speaking about
[2:34:21] spiritual things.
[2:34:24] &gt;&gt; This is what you want.
[2:34:25] &gt;&gt; Spiritual things. Amen.
[2:34:27] &gt;&gt; And Paul IS SAYING WHEN GOD GIVE YOU
[2:34:30] spiritual things,
[2:34:31] &gt;&gt; HE'S GIVING YOU BASED ON HIS RICHES.
[2:34:35] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD IS NOT POOR.
[2:34:37] &gt;&gt; I'M GOING SOMEWHERE. HE'S GIVING YOU
[2:34:40] ACCORDING TO THE RICHES
[2:34:42] &gt;&gt; OF HIS GLORY.
[2:34:43] &gt;&gt; SO IF GOD WANT TO GIVE YOU THE HOLY
[2:34:45] GHOST,
[2:34:50] &gt;&gt; HE GIVE YOU ABUNDANTLY.
[2:34:53] &gt;&gt; IF GOD [cheering] WANT TO GIVE YOU A
[2:34:55] GOOD HEALTH,
[2:34:56] &gt;&gt; GOD MUST GIVE YOU WHAT?
[2:34:59] &gt;&gt; YOU DIDN'T GET ME WELL.
[2:35:01] &gt;&gt; NOT JUST A HEALTH TO STAND UP,
[2:35:03] &gt;&gt; BUT TO BE ABLE TO JUMP.
[2:35:06] &gt;&gt; I HOPE we are together.
[2:35:12] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:35:14] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me well. When God RESTORE
[2:35:18] SARAH BACK,
[2:35:20] &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T JUST RESTORE HER BACK.
[2:35:23] &gt;&gt; HE RESTORES SARAH BACK
[2:35:25] &gt;&gt; AND CORRECTED THE WOMB.
[2:35:28] &gt;&gt; HE WAS BEYOND.
[2:35:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:35:31] &gt;&gt; I I I hope WE ARE TOGETHER.

[2:44:31] &gt;&gt; The world did what?
[2:44:33] &gt;&gt; Prosper.
[2:44:33] &gt;&gt; And Joseph. EVERYWHERE JOSEPH was
[2:44:38] &gt;&gt; there was what?
[2:44:39] &gt;&gt; Prosperity.
[2:44:41] &gt;&gt; Because that's a word you were afraid
[2:44:42] of.

[2:45:39] to preach what I want to preach because
[2:45:41] I just started.
[2:45:43] &gt;&gt; When Joseph went to the house of Pify,
[2:45:45] &gt;&gt; was Pify a believer?
[2:45:47] &gt;&gt; No.

[2:45:52] &gt;&gt; DID GOD CARE ABOUT HIS RELIGION?

[2:46:21] &gt;&gt; NOT THE HOUSE OF AN EGYPTIAN,
[2:46:24] &gt;&gt; THE HOUSE WHEN YOU GET YOU FOUND THE GOD

[2:52:10] I'M GOING TO LAND this airplane. Are we
[2:52:13] together?
[2:52:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together
[2:52:15] &gt;&gt; from today? That's why he can give you
[2:52:19] richly
[2:52:20] &gt;&gt; because he's rich.
[2:52:22] &gt;&gt; His rich is in glory. His rich is in
[2:52:25] glory.
[2:52:26] &gt;&gt; And now headed.
[2:52:28] &gt;&gt; Look at this my friend.
[2:52:31] &gt;&gt; FOR WE KNOW THE WHAT
[2:52:32] &gt;&gt; the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:52:35] &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus Christ come though he was
[2:52:39] &gt;&gt; rich.
[2:52:42] I just
[2:52:45] &gt;&gt; I told you at the beginning
[2:52:47] &gt;&gt; that the God that was in a parable was
[2:52:50] rich.
[2:52:51] &gt;&gt; You were reserved. I say I will bring
[2:52:53] brother. I told you God give you richly
[2:52:56] because he was rich. Some of you are
[2:52:58] still struggling. I showed you that in
[2:53:00] glory there is riches.
[2:53:02] &gt;&gt; Some of you still struggling. Now
[2:53:05] another scripture the Bible say the Lord
[2:53:07] Jesus Christ who was how? So God is how
[2:53:12] &gt;&gt; precisely the Lord Jesus Christ is how
[2:53:15] &gt;&gt; rich.
[2:53:16] &gt;&gt; This is your problem.
[2:53:19] &gt;&gt; Your problem is here.
[2:53:21] &gt;&gt; Your problem is here.
[2:53:22] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS THOUGH he was what?
[2:53:25] &gt;&gt; Rich.
[2:53:26] &gt;&gt; Yet for your what?
[2:53:28] &gt;&gt; He became what?
[2:53:29] &gt;&gt; Poor.
[2:53:29] &gt;&gt; So who made him poor?
[2:53:32] &gt;&gt; ME.
[2:53:34] &gt;&gt; Now you begin to understand.
[2:53:36] &gt;&gt; AH. SO THE SO originally
[2:53:40] &gt;&gt; originally
[2:53:41] &gt;&gt; originally
[2:53:44] &gt;&gt; JESUS CHRIST is rich.
[2:53:50] &gt;&gt; ORIGINALLY HE'S LLEON.
[2:53:55] [cheering]
[2:53:56] &gt;&gt; HE IS THE SON OF PROSPERITY.
[2:54:00] &gt;&gt; ORIGINALLY HE'S THE ONE THAT SOLOMON
[2:54:05] REFLECTED. HE'S THE ONE THAT JOSEPH
[2:54:08] reflected
[2:54:10] &gt;&gt; originally. HE IS [screaming] RICH.
[2:54:14] &gt;&gt; BUT TO SAVE YOU,
[2:54:21] &gt;&gt; HELP ME GO TO THE AIRPORT
[2:54:23] &gt;&gt; TO SAVE YOU, HE BECAME WHAT?
[2:54:27] &gt;&gt; HIM BECOMING POOR DOESN'T [screaming]
[2:54:29] MEAN HE'S RICH. HE'S NOT RICH.
[2:54:33] THAT POVERTY WAS A HUMILITY.
[2:54:37] &gt;&gt; HE HUMBLE HIMSELF. HE CONDESCENDED.
[2:54:44] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T GET ME WELL.
[2:54:46] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T GET me well.
[2:54:48] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to go to the airport. I got
[2:54:50] to turn around.
[2:54:51] &gt;&gt; This is your God.
[2:54:54] &gt;&gt; This is called rich.
[2:54:57] &gt;&gt; This is your God.
[2:54:58] &gt;&gt; Then they say, "Go pick up brother
[2:55:00] Charles.
[2:55:01] &gt;&gt; He took this
[2:55:02] Amen.
[2:55:03] &gt;&gt; And he put this like this.
[2:55:07] &gt;&gt; And he came.
[2:55:09] &gt;&gt; And this is what we all preach.
[2:55:13] &gt;&gt; We all preach here.
[2:55:15] &gt;&gt; We don't want to talk about THE QUOTE.

[2:55:32] an oven.
[2:55:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:55:38] &gt;&gt; You just give him a bread
[2:55:39] &gt;&gt; and he bypass everything.
[2:55:45] &gt;&gt; That's how rich he is. Where was the
[2:55:47] bread coming from? [cheering]
[2:55:50] &gt;&gt; Where was Oh, answer me. Where was the
[2:55:53] bread coming from?
[2:55:55] WHO WAS CREATING THE WHO WAS COOKING the
[2:55:57] bread?
[2:55:59] &gt;&gt; WHO WAS COOKING THE BREAD? WHERE WAS THE
[2:56:01] BREAD?
[2:56:05] &gt;&gt; WHERE WAS HE PRODUCING THE BREAD? FROM
[2:56:08] HIS RICHES
[2:56:09] &gt;&gt; in glory.
[2:56:11] &gt;&gt; From his riches in glory.
[2:56:15] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS NOT SPIRITUAL BREAD. THEY WERE
[2:56:17] NATURAL BREAD.
[2:56:19] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE NOT SPIRITUAL FISHES. NATURAL
[2:56:22] FISHES. HE WAS NOT A SPIRITUAL SQUIRREL,
[2:56:26] &gt;&gt; A NATURAL SQUIRREL.
[2:56:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:56:32] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:56:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:56:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[2:56:35] &gt;&gt; I'm about to finish, my friend. SO WHEN
[2:56:38] GOD WHEN GOD DECIDED TO COME AND pick
[2:56:42] you up, brother Tony,
[2:56:44] &gt;&gt; he took the jacket of wealth
[2:56:47] &gt;&gt; and he left it and took it off
[2:56:50] &gt;&gt; and he condescended and became poor.
[2:56:53] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:56:55] &gt;&gt; Remember our series our series is our
[2:56:58] journey through Joseph 5 G.
[2:57:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:57:01] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN HE WAS ENTERING THE EARTH
[2:57:04] &gt;&gt; AND JOSEPH STOOD ON. AMEN.
[2:57:07] &gt;&gt; THE MARY, THE HUSBAND OF MARY.
[2:57:10] &gt;&gt; He have TO BE JOSEPH.
[2:57:12] &gt;&gt; JESUS ENTERED THE EARTH WITH A JOSEPH.
[2:57:17] &gt;&gt; I'M GOING SOMEWHERE. I'M ABOUT TO
[2:57:19] FINISH. WHEN HE'S COMING, THERE MUST BE
[2:57:22] A JOSEPH BECAUSE JOSEPH WAS THE SON OF
[2:57:25] PROSPERITY. JOSEPH REPRESENTED JESUS
[2:57:28] CHRIST.
[2:57:33] BROTHER GLENN, I'M TRYING TO CALM DOWN.
[2:57:35] YOU DON'T GET PLEASE LET'S FOCUS
[2:57:39] &gt;&gt; JOSEPH IN THE OLD testament brother
[2:57:41] Brandham say HE WAS THE TOP of the son
[2:57:44] of prosperity and wherever Joseph goes
[2:57:47] it's what
[2:57:48] &gt;&gt; he prosper and it's blessed
[2:57:51] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE WAS REFLECTING JESUS CHRIST
[2:57:53] &gt;&gt; THE SON OF PROSPERITY
[2:57:55] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER SO WHEN JESUS CHRIST WAS
[2:57:58] COMING DOWN
[2:57:59] &gt;&gt; JOSEPH WAS ALREADY THERE
[2:58:01] &gt;&gt; THE HUSBAND OF MARY
[2:58:03] &gt;&gt; HIS NAME WAS JOSEPH
[2:58:05] THERE MUST BE A REASON WHY HIS NAME MUST
[2:58:08] BE JOSEPH.
[2:58:09] &gt;&gt; SO JESUS ENTERED THE EARTH [screaming]
[2:58:11] WITH A JOSEPH.
[2:58:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:58:15] &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. IF YOU DON'T
[2:58:17] HAVE ME, I STOP RIGHT HERE.
[2:58:20] &gt;&gt; I'M HEADING SOMEWHERE.
[2:58:22] &gt;&gt; BROTHER TONY, I'M HEADING SOMEWHERE. HE
[2:58:24] ENTERED THE EARTH WITH A JOSEPH.
[2:58:26] &gt;&gt; A JOSEPH. BUT BECAUSE HE WAS COMING HOW?
[2:58:31] &gt;&gt; THIS POVERTY AFFECTED THAT JOSEPH.
[2:58:37] &gt;&gt; [screaming]
[2:58:39] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT SAYING AMEN.
[2:58:42] &gt;&gt; Let let's shake ourselves.
[2:58:44] &gt;&gt; Let's shake ourselves.
[2:58:46] &gt;&gt; Let's shake ourselves.
[2:58:49] &gt;&gt; JOSEPH IN THE OLD TESTAMENT WAS A RICH
[2:58:52] MAN.
[2:58:53] &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING PROSPERED.
[2:58:55] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN JESUS WAS CONDESCENDING,
[2:58:57] BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY HE STRIP HIMSELF
[2:58:59] FROM HIS GLORY
[2:59:00] &gt;&gt; AND HE BECAME POOR. SO AS HE WAS COMING
[2:59:03] POOR, HE COULD NOT COME TO A RICH
[2:59:06] JOSEPH.
[2:59:07] &gt;&gt; THAT JOSEPH'S LIFE WAS NOW CHANGED TO A
[2:59:11] POOR MAN
[2:59:12] &gt;&gt; TO MATCH THE POOR coming
[2:59:17] [cheering]
[2:59:20] &gt;&gt; this SIDE. I NEED TO HEAR AMEN HERE.
[2:59:23] [cheering]
[2:59:24] &gt;&gt; CAN I CONTINUE? CAN I CONTINUE? BROTHER
[2:59:28] SAYS THIS. BROTHER SAYS THIS. HE SAY
[2:59:32] ANOTHER THING. HE WAS BROUGHT BY WHO?
[2:59:34] &gt;&gt; THE POOR.
[2:59:35] &gt;&gt; MARY AND JOSEPH WAS HOW?
[2:59:37] &gt;&gt; VERY POOR PEOPLE.
[2:59:38] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE WHAT? [screaming]
[2:59:40] &gt;&gt; PEASANTS.
[2:59:40] &gt;&gt; WHY WERE THEY POOR?
[2:59:42] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE ONE COMING IS HOW?
[2:59:44] &gt;&gt; POOR.
[2:59:47] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:59:50] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:59:51] &gt;&gt; WHEN THEY WERE POOR, THEY FOUND A JOSEPH
[2:59:56] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS POOR MAN. BECAUSE THE LORD IS
[2:59:59] CONDESCENDING AS A POOR MAN,
[3:00:01] &gt;&gt; BUT ORIGINALLY HE'S OUT.
[3:00:05] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN he Are we together?
[3:00:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together? [cheering]
[3:00:10] &gt;&gt; To leave
[3:00:11] &gt;&gt; THE HEAVEN

[3:00:14] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[3:00:15] &gt;&gt; To leave heaven
[3:00:17] &gt;&gt; and to COME TO THE EARTH,
[3:00:19] &gt;&gt; HE MOVED from water
[3:00:21] &gt;&gt; to water.
[3:00:22] &gt;&gt; IF HE NEED TO GO BACK,
[3:00:25] &gt;&gt; HE'S HE'S GOING BACK. HOW? TO REACH.
[3:00:27] &gt;&gt; HE'S GOING BACK. HOW?
[3:00:29] &gt;&gt; TO REACH. [cheering]
[3:00:31] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE JESUS CHRIST NEVER WENT BACK THE
[3:00:35] WAY HE CAME IN. HE WENT WITH A GLORIFIED
[3:00:38] BODY.
[3:00:41] [cheering]
[3:00:42] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? ARE WE TOGETHER?
[3:00:45] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:00:46] &gt;&gt; Are we together? ARE WE TOGETHER?
[3:00:49] &gt;&gt; HE CAME POOR,
[3:00:51] &gt;&gt; MET A POOR JOSEPH. BUT BEFORE HE GOES

[3:01:33] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE'S TRYING TO EXIT.
[3:01:37] &gt;&gt; HE CANNOT EXIT PO.
[3:01:40] &gt;&gt; HE CANNOT EXIT PO. HE NEED TO GO BACK TO

[3:06:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The God
[3:06:59] &gt;&gt; that save us
[3:07:01] &gt;&gt; is a rich God.
[3:07:03] &gt;&gt; He became poor
[3:07:04] &gt;&gt; because of the work of the atonement.
[3:07:07] &gt;&gt; That's why he didn't have a place
[3:07:09] &gt;&gt; to lay his uh his head.
[3:07:12] &gt;&gt; He said the bird of the earth they have
[3:07:14] nest. The foxes have den but not the son
[3:07:17] of man. He didn't mean he was poor.
[3:07:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:07:21] &gt;&gt; He didn't mean he WAS POOR. HE SAYS I
[3:07:24] CAN CALL MY FATHER runner
[3:07:26] &gt;&gt; and he can give a legion of angels.
[3:07:29] &gt;&gt; HE WAS NOT POOR.
[3:07:30] &gt;&gt; HE WAS NOT FEEBLE BECAUSE HE WAS ALL
[3:07:32] MIGHTY GOD.
[3:07:34] &gt;&gt; BUT HE CAME AS a feeble.

[3:07:38] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN SOLOMON LOOK HE SAY THE fairest

[3:07:54] &gt;&gt; In his ministry, he became poor
[3:07:58] &gt;&gt; so that we
[3:08:01] &gt;&gt; so that we can stay poor.
[3:08:08] &gt;&gt; Sorry, brother John.

[3:08:32] POOR.
[3:08:34] &gt;&gt; It was because of me.

[3:10:08] &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Heavenly Father,
[3:10:11] &gt;&gt; Lord, we are approaching you humbly this
[3:10:13] afternoon. [music]
[3:10:15] &gt;&gt; Father, thanking you for your grace, for
[3:10:17] your love, for your mercy, and for
[3:10:20] everything you have been doing for us.
[3:10:22] Father, there is no way a man can see
[3:10:25] these things.
[3:10:27] It only takes the supernatural action of
[3:10:30] the Holy Spirit to unfold your word in
[3:10:34] such a way that we can see clarity and
[3:10:38] understand who truly you are Lord.
[3:10:41] Father we have a picture painted many
[3:10:44] ways by Catholic [music]
[3:10:46] by Jehovah witnesses even among the
[3:10:49] message that the picture was not painted
[3:10:52] right. [music]
[3:10:54] But father, you are bringing the right
[3:10:55] angle where we can turn the picture to
[3:10:58] the right and we will see you clearly
[3:11:00] and say that is Christ.
[3:11:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:11:02] &gt;&gt; That is our God.
[3:11:04] &gt;&gt; That's the one that died on the cross
[3:11:06] for us. That the one that took our
[3:11:08] place. That the one that stripped
[3:11:10] himself. The one that sanctify himself.
[3:11:13] That refused to even be married so that
[3:11:17] we can be married. Hallelujah. that
[3:11:19] refuse to have natural children so that
[3:11:22] we can have children. [music]
[3:11:24] He spoke from his mouth that I sanctify
[3:11:28] myself. You sanctify yourself so that
[3:11:31] your children can reap the benefit of
[3:11:34] your sanctification. Father, may we take
[3:11:37] a hold of Calvary of all the benefit
[3:11:40] that you shed the blood for. May you
[3:11:42] help this church and your children all
[3:11:44] over the world so that we can come up to
[3:11:47] the clear understanding and revelation
[3:11:50] of who you are. Amen. Because you are a
[3:11:52] big God that our mind cannot even
[3:11:55] comprehend because you are the one that
[3:11:57] feel space time and eternity. Oh God,
[3:12:00] help us up and take the sermon that was
[3:12:03] preached, Lord. And may Oh God, Father,
[3:12:05] [music] you continue to work on it. And
[3:12:07] if time again, may we come back, Lord,
[3:12:10] and continue to go [music] and continue,
[3:12:13] Lord, Father, to enjoy this blessing
[3:12:16] that you are unfolding to us day by day.
[3:12:18] We commit everything unto the hand and
[3:12:21] humbly ask it, Father, in the name of
[3:12:23] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[3:12:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music]
[3:12:26] &gt;&gt; God bless you, church.
[3:12:28] &gt;&gt; We love you.
[3:12:31] &gt;&gt; [music]
[3:12:41] &gt;&gt; because [music] we didn't get to what I
[3:12:43] was trying to preach.
[3:12:45] Just bear with me. Be patient. We will
[3:12:47] get that. You can call this from Joseph
[3:12:50] to Joseph.
