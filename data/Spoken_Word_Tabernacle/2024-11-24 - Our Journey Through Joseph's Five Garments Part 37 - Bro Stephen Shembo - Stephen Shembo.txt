preaching about Mark 11 and uh and the squirrels tying those together and also the two witnesses from um Deuteronomy and that thing stayed in my heart all week the the main point was don't overemphasize the power of the spoken word it's the faith that it that it increases through patience after you've spoken it because it was instant the first time with that first squirrel but he actually had two instances of Three Squirrels and so that was a big lesson and it was wonderful and that's where we're at they're preaching it everywhere so let's speak Jesus this morning as a

Tabernacle we trust this is going to be a blessing to you this morning amen I believe everyone is up to date with the sermon we're reading our Bible twice a day one chapter in the morning one chapter before you go to bed someone is reading their cood the church ages the 70 weeks of Daniel the seals are option or somebody's listening to the message of the hour amen you cannot be in this message for 20 years and never read the church ages something is wrong let me repeat it again you cannot be in this message 20 years and you cannot even finish the church ages it means your foundation is [Music] zero amen your foundation is zero in the church ages brother Bram give a scripture and he explain a scripture and you explain and if you take the church ages with the the uh with your Bible and you begin to read side by side you will see how much growth you will have spiritually amen especially sisters nobody say that brothers are the only one listening to the message take that out of this church we are all Sons and Daughters of God Amen so read your church ages read the adoption don't wait for me to give you everything amen I had somebody asking me a question a good question recently I said you go listen to the sermon the future home and the future home got the entire answer in detail if not I will just give I mean uh get a quote and give it and he did and he sent me a message and now he's sending me a message with the answers himself that's the way I want you to be amen you got to read the message message for yourself so when you listening to a preacher you say this is not what brother Bram say amen amen not so and so say HH we want to see where brother Bram say we want to see where the Bible say if the Bible didn't say brother Bram didn't say and you keep it to yourself sh [Laughter] so I will always encourage you listen to the message of brother Brandon amen especially when you single this is the best time to accumulate as much message as you can before you get married and children and diaper and this one is screaming emergency room all this kind of stuff this is the best time for you to accumulate everything that you can because one of these day you will begin to regret you say I wish ahead listen to brother Steven amen so always you drive into your car go ahead and cut that tape on and listen to the message even 20 minutes you stop tomorrow 20 minutes tomorrow 20 minutes in 3 days you find out you finish a sermon amen amen you're not too busy I don't know how many are busier than me so if I read the message you should be having more time than me I'm not saying I'm more than you know that's not what I'm saying in other word you should have time right to listen listen to the message amen love is discipline you need that quote again you remember that quote right that's what the prophet say so put your head in the word get your head off from the social media whatever is going on go into the word and listen to the message of the hour amen the young men meeting we're still working on it young Sisters Meeting December 7th Lord's willing question and answer December 14th Lord's willing married couple December 21st same place same time I got more questions in the married couple so I don't know how many session we will take the reason why we keep it back to back is sometime when you start a subject and you wait three month you lose the momentum yes sir amen so when the momentum is there let's just go ahead and deal with this because they are question after question after a question until we get to birth control then we are all of you it's not going to be me and myself we read the Bible and we read brother Bram like we always do all the way until you got your own answer clear and never use my name and say brother Steven say you say brother Bram say and the Bible says amen until somebody ask you who is your pastor and then you can tell my name but if it's not use brother Bram and use the Bible amen am so Lord's willing December the 21st we ride there by God's grace this coming week again remember our service is on Tuesday at 7:30 not on Wednesday if you come on Wednesday you call the Deacon they will open the church you can come in and spend some time praying amen so Tuesday that's when our Thanksgiving services at 7:30 brother John and sister Ed thank you very much for taking care of the young man on the bonfire so somebody took a little load off of me so I say brother John is there he's uh married and uh uh brother Zach is there married brother Chris is there married so they already got three couples there so they don't need me to be there so I can catch up on something else it doesn't mean I didn't want to be there but if I if I have to be everywhere even God have to be in one place you need a court do you need a CT that's brother brandham said the omniscient of God doesn't means god is everywhere that's a Pentecostal understanding God is a man he's a human being he's somewhere but his knowledge is what makes him omnipresent omniscient actually means knowing everything and because he knows everything he looks like he's everywhere amen so by God's grace I am like my maker so I can only be in one place place in one time amen but God can also help us break into a channel and we know what you're doing somewhere in secret and we can tell you you went somewhere and you did this and this and this and this is what happened amen amen so brother John and sister God richly bless you and I trust that you had a wonderful time I saw some picture in the youth chat of somebody was uh having a good time amen am ah I want to hear those that way there amen okay so somebody has a good time so let's go straight to our scripture this morning you need to keep your Bible amen if I tell

heavy hair flight so stay tight with your Bible we will go slowly as we break into the son amen let's go to Psalm 82 glory to God my subject this morning is our life journey through Joseph's five garment part 37 the theme you usually look after service then we see how far we can go with this because this word is so loaded Psalm 82 can you imagine we've been reading a scripture almost going into three month amen I'm a pastor that follow the Holy Spirit my friend where the spirit is saying something that's what I'm going to do if he stays stay there I will stay there until because if I don't follow him then I begin to give you my preferences and I cannot do that amen amen Psalm 82 Satan stop playing again this game H okay you will catch up my friend all right Psalm 82 verse 1 a Psalm of AA the Bible says that God stands in the congregation of the mighty so if the congregation is in the mighty of the Mighty God is there you might be seated it's a church it's a congregation amen and God is always there give me a minute and uh let me work with this because we need to get into something and I trust everybody slept well and everything by God's grace amen Oh Glory to God

I know what to do all right verse six we there verse six the Bible says you got the microphone thank you my brother in verse six the Bible say I have said this is God talking ye are Gods am you should be happy now knowing these kind of things amen I'm going to show you because this body here pulls you down with gravity and there is another body pulling you up I have said that ye are Gods brother Robert please I need another one yes sir we are ye are gods and all of you are children of the most High amen you know the Bible says that the most high dwelleth not in the house made by human by hands amen you know that right if you are God do you really dwell in House made by human men come on now brother amen hallelujah amen I don't know if you get what I'm saying you know what a flight attendant prepare for take off let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we approaching you humbly this morning Father thanking you for your grace your love your mercy and for everything we have you have been doing for us Lord this is as far as I can go with the ability you have given me but when he comes to preach to teach to interpret to feed your flock he only take the Holy Spirit himself to do it may you move me out of the way and the audience Lord may you come and speak and be the one hearing interpreting and giving the Revelation may you begin with us Lord Jesus Christ all the way to the end as we commit it all unto thy hand rebuking every demonic spirit away from this place in Jesus precious name amen the Bible say I have said ye are gods and all of you are children of the most high this one speak about a divine record thank you brother Robert a Divine record amen and this record here have a different nationality glory to God this record goes with a nationality amen let's go to verse seven then we get it the Bible say but it's a contrast so two records but I will show you again this down the road but you shall die like men gods don't die Gods here gods do not die amen amen amen they don't die but these Gods dies what dies it's not the god break it down break it down it is the V the body that house the god you can kill the man Jesus Christ but you cannot kill the God that was in Jesus [Applause] Christ are we together so this God can die amen this is a natural an Earthly yes amen every record amen am and this This Record have nationalities amen This Record here may be an americ amen this one may be an African he might be a European he might be somebody from the Congo somebody from Canada somebody from France somebody from South Africa it's here but this also have another nationality and that nationalities is not in this world are we together are we together and when we are born we are born into this record here first and then we take this record as our nationality we stand for it we fight for it that's right we defend it we are even ready to die for it until this first record is activated when the first record is activated then you find out that you don't belong to this [Applause] world glory to God the Bible says in Hebrew 11:9 that by what sa not by intellect by Revelation by faith what happened he sour in the land this is Abraham he soured in the land of what promise who promised Abraham the land Jesus God who gave him the land god so if Abraham is in the land that God promised and give it to him Abraham should be satisfied that God told me I give you the promised land I'm in the promised land I sit in the promised land that's it but there was something about Abraham even though God gave him a natural land come on brother amen even though God gave him a natural land but Abraham understood that there is more than the natural land the Bible says that he sour in the land of promise as in a what strange country how can you go where God told you go somewhere I give you the land who says God who gave it to you God who fight for you God and you get there and instead of living comfortable like everything is okay I belong this is the ground that God gave me I can fight for it Abraham when he got there he's living like a stranger what makes Abraham Live Like a Stranger even though he's in the promised land even though you are in the place where God wants you to be you are in the country where God wants you to be but still you need to know where you coming from and the only way to know is by Faith by Revelation so Abraham was never satisfied in the Promised Land even though his Blessing ATT tied to the promised land but the promised land was not the end of Abraham America is not our end are we together are we together are we the Seed of Abraham and therefore we need to behave like Abraham Abraham they gave him a country but he was not satisfied he was not comfortable in the promised land how can you be in the promised land and you're not comfortable because there is another record there is another nationality that is calling for Abraham the promised land was only a type it was only a shadow of the true [Applause] nationality are we together are we together he says he live in the promised land as in a what strange country a strange country dwelling in what Tabernacles with Isaac and who Jacob the hair of him of the what the same promise the hair with him of the same promise for for means because the reason why he was living like that is because he looked amen for a what a city which has what Foundation whose Builder and maker is who God Abraham understood that for me to be comfortable I need a house that God himself is the Builder God live in the house built by God you are Gods your future home is a house built by God not by human being because a house built by God is [Applause] bulletproof are we together are we together oh glory to God Amen he said for he look for what a city which what has Foundation the foundation of that City whose Builder and maker is who God that's why we waiting for the future home the one who put the foundation is God so when I get into the city I got in the city of [Applause] gods in the city of gods the lamb himself is a light that's the city that I'm comfortable in that City I don't behave as a Sur I behave like I'm home that's why you will never be comfortable in this area here we will always be comfortable when we reach [Applause] [Music] [Applause] home but enjoy the promised land live in the promised land but remember that's not the end Hallelujah are we together amen Oh Glory to God in John 15 verse 19 the Bible say if he were of what the world ah the world would do what love his own but because you are not of the [Music] world you are not American we are not American am we are not in this world the nation American belong to the world Africa belong to the world it doesn't belong in [Applause] heaven he says if you were of the world the world would do what love his own but because he are not of the world but I have done what chosen you where out of the world therefore the world do what ha you so you going to have a seven but you also have a six you are in this word by you are not of the world you are coming from another planet when I say Planet it's world Amen in John 17:14 Jesus say I have given them Thy word and the world has hated them because they are not of what the world even as I am not of what the world so we en Jesus come from [Applause] [Music] somewhere we have a different record amen and he says they

country a far country sorry and there wasted his substance with what Wiest this is what we did separated from God all the way out away from the common wealth of God we were there and then finally the Lord came to us now we heading back home we clear on that one I'm trying to save time so I can move we clear on that one now jump to verse 17 the Bible says in verse 17 follow me now and when he came to himself he said how many hired servant of my father have bred enough and to spare and I perish with Hunger it's fine that push him there I will arise and go to my father and I will say to him father I have sin against the heaven and before you and I'm no more worthy to be called your son based on what he did he disqualified himself from being a son he say a son of a father like that cannot behave the way I did are we together I'm Amen in other word that father have a certain life uhuh but what was displayed was not really the father's life that's right amen what was that father have

father said to his son he said to who his servant so somehow the servant to where he we already went through this because the Bible say when he was a far off so there is a distance here between home and where the father and the son met but the father didn't go himself are we together because he talked to the servant so there must be certain servant that came down we okay right I'm going slowly my friend and we know who the servants are right we have a number they are okay I'm going to put six amen this is four five six and the seventh one is God himself because there were servant here six of

on the Feet Shoes brother Bram say when this boy was coming he had all clothing was already ragged amen amen but the power to transform him was not given to him he was given to the angel the power of transformation lays with the angel that came with the father I don't know if you get me the power to take the son and change him and clean him up and transform him is already with the constellation so when the constellation comes he doesn't come only to meet you he removes sin but there is more work to do the message has a package he meet you first embrace you remove your sin then begin

doesn't come at the beginning he come at the last oh Lord help me amen and then I will send my beloved Son and maybe they will reverence him when they see him but when the husband men saw him they reason among themselves saying this is the hair so the Beloved son is who the air ah Lord help me This is the End Amen come let us do what kill him that the inheritance may be who ours so they cast him out of the vineyard and kill him what therefore shall the Lord of The Vineyard do to them he shall come and destroy this husband men and shall give give the vineyard to who others follow me carefully he's going to give the vineyard to who others others we need to know who's others amen others amen he will give it to others and when they heard it they say God forbid ah why are they saying God forbid go to verse 19 go go to verse 19 and the who the remember who started and the who scries the same hour sought to lay hand on him and they F the people for they perceive that he has spoken this Parable against who so this Parable was against the scrab the chief priest and the elders and Jesus spoke that Parable against them let's refocus our land very well let's go to Matthew 21 father help me I'm saying help me because my time is running so let's get Matthew 21 my friend if you dare you can say Amen before it gets juicy Matthew 21:23 if you thereare you can say Amen I'm going to start getting there amen amen amen amen verse 23 the Bible says you there amen and when he was come into the temple the who the chief priest in the on the board and the who the Elders of the people came to him as he was teaching and say by what Authority do you do do you these things and who gave you this what Authority the reason why I gave you that is to show you that it's the same story but let's focus now and listen to this jum to verse 33 if you thereare you can say amen amen he and another Parable remember the parable was against them yes sir there was a certain household which planted what a Vineyard so this Vineyard was planted by the owner it's a planted vineard father help me amen amen he was planted by the householder and did what HED HED it planted and put a hedge somebody say surrend or hedge HED I have the King James amen HED round about and did what and dig a wine person planted hedg and digged follow me carefully and dig the wine press in here and built a what a tower and built a tower please follow me built a what to Tower a tower and what else and built a tower and let it out in other way rented to husband men and went into a a far country ah and when the time of the fruit junai let's stop here this Vineyard was planted by the owner the owner planted follow me hedg it follow me dig a wine press we together and built a tower what is this Vineyard amen before we continue Isaiah 5 verse one the Bible say now I will sing to my who well the well beloved of Isaiah a song of my beloved touching his what ven so the Beloved of us they have a vinion please follow me okay he says my well beloved has a what in a very what so the place is fruitful and he did what remember hedge yes sir remember HED he put a first and got out the stone thereof and did what planted it HED it fence it plant it we still have dig a wine press and buil to and then he planted it with the choice Vine and built a what it's already there in the midst of it and also made a what wine press therein and he looked that he should bring forth what and he brought forth what what Grace So now Isaiah is giving us a description of this vinion amen the same thing Jesus spoke Isaiah spoke what is this Vineyard the same verse same chapter verse what for the vineyard of the Lord of host is what the house of Israel are we clear now we clear now we clear now the house of Israel is this Vineyard remember we dealing with the other son we clear now now let's go back to our Bible the Bible says and when the time 34 of the fruit dwai he sent his servant to the husbandman that they might receive the fruits of it and the husbandman took his servant and beat one and did what killed another and did what stoned another these are killers they they kill and stone again he sent another other servant more than the first and they did to them how meaning they kill and stone but last of all he sent to them who his son we need to see how many son does he have but here it's singular his son saying they will reverence my son but when the husband men saw the son they say among themel this is the air come let us do what kill him like they killed the other and let us seize on his inheritance and they caught him and cast him out of the vineyard and slew him when the Lord therefore of the vineyard come what will he do to these husband men they say to him he will miserably destroy those wicked men and will let out his Vineyard to other husband men which shall render him the fruits when in their season so when Israel will destroy the son the last messenger of Israel will be the son God who in San time spoke to Our Father by the in this last days SP To Us by the but when they will kill the son The Vineyard will be removed from Israel and send to other husband men that will give fruit in its season spiritual food in It season so the Gentile will have seasons oh [Laughter] [Applause] god father help me up listen to this my friend who killed the prophet he says D has brought aine where out of Egypt that has cast out the Heathen and did what planted it which is Israel that prepare us room before it and that did cause it to take deep root and he filled what the land he said why has that them broke has then broken down her edges remember it was FC so that all which pass by do plag her and the vine and the vineyard which the right hand has what so Israel was planted by God brother Bram interpret this scripture he says you plucked up a vine out of Egypt which was Israel and you brought it and planted in a water good place that was what Israel God's people was where in Egypt they were what good Vine and they were God's what chosen but if a good Vine is not set in good ground he will not bring forth what good fruits amen if a Son of God is Not planted in a good environment let me put it home is not planted in a good church he will bring bad [Applause] fruit some of the fruit you brought was not you it was because of the ground that you were absorbing Shake somebody my friend I don't know if I will touch the subject the way you going with me I don't know shake somebody say God bless you and let me start it again amen amen brother Bram says my God good f is not set on what good ground but if a good one is not set where on good ground he will not bring forth what good fruits the problem is not Divine the problem is the [Applause] ground you are
