[34:41] us with a song amen
[34:53] amen all right let's just bow our heads
[34:56] before the Lord father we're so grateful
[35:00] so thankful that you have brought us
[35:03] here again one more time
[35:06] lord lord it makes me think of the
[35:08] sermon that your Prophet preached just
[35:11] once more
[35:13] Lord Lord just once more
[35:17] father Lord let us lift up our hearts
[35:20] Lord and our our souls Lord before you
[35:25] father because that soul Lord that lays
[35:29] down within these bodies of
[35:32] Flesh Lord that soul is
[35:36] priceless and that's what you shed your
[35:38] blood
[35:40] for father the suffering that you went
[35:43] through for that soul that lays within
[35:48] us and Lord as you call us Lord and as
[35:52] we hear your word Lord
[35:55] from Sunday to Sunday Monday and
[35:58] Wednesday to Wednesday and as we go
[36:00] through the week listening to going back
[36:02] and listening to these messages Lord and
[36:05] and listen to your Prophet Lord and that
[36:08] word is calling us up little by little
[36:12] coming up a little
[36:14] higher and Lord as that word just like
[36:17] that little caterpillar Lord that's
[36:19] crawling on the
[36:21] ground Lord but something stirs within
[36:25] him to go climb a tree
[36:29] and weave a
[36:30] cocoon because there's something in him
[36:33] that has to come
[36:36] forth and Lord there's something in us
[36:38] that has to come
[36:40] forth we have to break out of these
[36:42] cocoons of
[36:44] Flesh and Lord we have to spread our
[36:46] wings and fly like the eagle Lord we
[36:49] can't be bound to this earth
[36:52] anymore Lord just let our wings Lord
[36:55] soar through the heavenly
[36:59] and Lord we just thank you Father for
[37:02] what you're giving to us Lord this
[37:04] spiritual food father and Lord as I was
[37:07] listening to brother Chad on on on the
[37:10] way here father and the message that he
[37:13] brought Sunday that everything that is
[37:17] contrary to this word is a
[37:22] lie no matter what we feel in our
[37:25] bodies what a doctor May tell us Lord
[37:30] what what Satan may put in our minds
[37:34] it's all a
[37:36] lie the only thing that is true is your
[37:40] word and father that is what we stand
[37:44] upon is your word than because you plac
[37:48] that word within
[37:51] us and father we don't want to
[37:55] forget the destruction father that has
[37:59] engulfed this area all the way up
[38:03] through the western part of the state in
[38:05] Tennessee and Lord the the destruction
[38:09] is
[38:10] unreal and father the people that are
[38:13] suffering because of
[38:15] it and Lord the right now in Florida
[38:19] those people there father that are going
[38:21] through what they're going
[38:23] through but Lord the bottom line is your
[38:27] Prophet pronounced judgment on this
[38:31] land because they have turned their back
[38:34] upon you Lord you offered
[38:38] mercy and when mercy is turned down
[38:41] there's nothing that but
[38:43] judgment but father as humans father we
[38:46] feel for them people and Lord we just
[38:49] ask to Lord if there is any Mercy that
[38:52] can be granted father Grant mercy upon
[38:55] them Lord and we just the service Lord
[38:58] into your hands Lord be the speaker be
[39:02] the hearer bless the tithes and the
[39:05] offering Lord and let our hearts burn
[39:08] within us father as you speak to us
[39:11] along the way we just commit it all into
[39:13] your
[39:14] hands and when we leave here father
[39:17] we'll say it was good to be here amen
[39:20] and we look forward to what you have
[39:22] prepared for us already for Sunday
[39:25] father we're looking so forward to that
[39:28] Lord we just commit it into your hands
[39:31] father bless our pastor Lord he the

[54:10] as you're turning there we just greet
[54:11] you tonight the name of the Lord and
[54:12] always a a great treat and blessing to

[54:17] brother Steven and the invitation to

[54:21] shoulder to the wheel we don't have no
[54:23] new message to bring no new word to
[54:25] bring uh Prophet said it's actually the
[54:27] oldest religion that there is amen and
[54:30] uh we're here just to to be a help to
[54:33] you and encourage you along the way and
[54:35] as the Bible would say stir up your pure
[54:37] Mind by a way of remembrance and so we
[54:40] we just certainly appreciate this church
[54:41] here and uh the open door amen we we're
[54:44] all United under the same word and uh we
[54:47] just appreciate the spirit of the Lord
[54:49] here tonight we just say God bless you I
[54:52] won't prolong the time let's read here
[54:54] in Mark 7
[54:56] and the first verse the Bible says this
[55:00] then came G or then came together unto
[55:02] him the Pharisees and certain of the
[55:04] scribes which came from Jerusalem when
[55:07] they saw some of his disciples eat bread
[55:09] with defiled that is to say with
[55:12] unwashed hands notice that the tradition
[55:15] of the Pharisees there they they said
[55:17] that they're eating food with dirty
[55:19] hands they're defiled they're eating
[55:21] defiled this is to say with unwashed
[55:23] hands and they found they found fault
[55:26] they a that a good
[55:28] Pharisee always finding
[55:31] fa we got some we got some in the house
[55:34] of God always finding fault with
[55:36] something Prophet said if you look for
[55:38] it you'll find
[55:39] it it's just what the prophet said for
[55:41] the Pharisees and all the Jews except
[55:43] they wash their hands off they eat not
[55:46] amen now some of us working people would
[55:49] just throw us out right there they eat
[55:51] not with their hands eat not because
[55:53] they're holding the traditions of the
[55:55] elders
[55:57] and not holding the
[55:58] word but holding traditions of the
[56:01] elders and when they came from the
[56:03] market except they was they eat not and
[56:05] many other things there be which they
[56:07] have received to hold as the washing of
[56:09] Cups and pots Brazen vessels and of
[56:12] tables and then the Pharisees and
[56:14] scribes asked him why not or why walk
[56:18] not with thy disciples according to the
[56:20] tradition of the elders but eat bread
[56:22] with unwashed hands and me notice the
[56:25] question they're asking this is how we
[56:27] do why are you not walking after our
[56:29] tradition why why are your disciples not
[56:32] doing this in other words this is how
[56:34] our church does it why are you not doing
[56:37] it this way and he answered and said
[56:38] unto them well hath Isaiah's prophesied
[56:40] of
[56:41] you Hypocrites as it is written these
[56:45] this people honth me with their
[56:48] lips but their heart is far from me I
[56:51] say God never let me be that
[56:53] person they honored me with their lips
[56:56] good lip service but their heart is far
[56:58] from me how be it in vain do they
[57:01] worship me I wonder how many people are
[57:03] gathered together on on Wednesday night
[57:05] right now worshiping God in vain in vain
[57:09] do they worship me teaching for Doctrine
[57:11] the Commandments of men for laying aside
[57:14] the Commandment of God ye hold the
[57:16] tradition of men as the washing of pots
[57:19] and cups and many other such things like
[57:22] you do and he said unto them full well
[57:25] you reject the Comm commandment of God
[57:27] that you may keep your own
[57:30] tradition let's read also here in
[57:32] revelation 22 yes sir and the 18th verse
[57:37] you're probably already seeing the
[57:38] direction we want to go tonight uh by
[57:40] the help of the Lord uh here in
[57:43] revelation 22 and8 for I testify unto
[57:46] every man that heareth the words of the
[57:48] prophecy of this book If any man shall
[57:50] add unto these things God shall add unto
[57:54] him the plagues that are written in this
[57:55] book it's a dangerous place to add to
[57:57] the word and if any man take away from
[58:00] the words of the book of this prophecy
[58:02] God shall take away his part out of the
[58:05] book of life and out of the holy city
[58:08] and from the things which are written in
[58:09] the book he which testify these things
[58:13] say surely I come quickly amen even so
[58:17] come Lord Jesus we just ask that God
[58:19] will bless his word as you can be seated
[58:21] tonight and uh I want to take a subject
[58:24] and it may be a little strange strange
[58:26] and it was to me as I was first studying
[58:28] these things but I'd like to title it
[58:30] throw away your toid throw away your
[58:33] tomed now some of you that have studied
[58:35] any uh literature and Judaism you know
[58:38] that there's a book that's called the
[58:39] Torah and there's actually several books
[58:42] in Judaism and the one that they would
[58:44] call the first book of Judaism that the
[58:46] Jews would follow would be called the
[58:48] Torah now in simple words what the Torah
[58:50] is it would be the foundation of the
[58:52] Books of Moses so the Torah would be
[58:55] what the the law was given on Mount SII
[58:58] that was given unto Moses the prophet
[59:00] and then it's compiled into a book that
[59:03] the Jews would observe and that was
[59:05] their that was their law book if you
[59:06] would call it that way and the Torah is
[59:09] what the Jews would observe and now
[59:11] another book would be called the kak
[59:13] which is known or the Tanakh which is
[59:14] known as the Hebrew Bible and in that
[59:17] book there would be books of the
[59:18] prophets in it and and different
[59:20] writings and things in it they would
[59:22] take uh books of the prophets and they
[59:24] would take some uh verses out of the
[59:26] Torah and different uh literature of the
[59:29] prophets and they would compile that
[59:30] book which the Jews would study and the
[59:33] one that really grabbed my attention as
[59:35] I was fellowshipping with some brothers
[59:37] about this uh would be called the toid
[59:39] now the Tet is actually a you can study
[59:42] all these things out online if you'd
[59:43] like to pull it up it's very interesting
[59:45] to study uh but you just give me some
[59:48] Grace as we go through some of this but
[59:50] uh the the tment to me really Drew my
[59:52] attention because it's a collection of
[59:55] uh many anent ranic writings that would
[59:58] extend all the way back even before the
[1:00:00] time of Christ and all of these writings
[1:00:03] some of them
