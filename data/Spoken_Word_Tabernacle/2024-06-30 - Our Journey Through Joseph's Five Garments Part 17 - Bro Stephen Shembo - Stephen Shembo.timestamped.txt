[58:15] Genesis chapter
[58:19] 39 glory to
[58:24] God you know where we are
[58:31] right thank you
[58:38] Jesus these sort of teaching covers
[58:42] everything sometime you're trying to
[58:45] stay on the line and it knocks something
[58:47] away somewhere and correct somebody
[58:49] somewhere and then we come back again
[58:52] and we keep moving
[58:54] amen verse one
[58:56] and Joseph was brought down to
[59:01] Egypt and pipar an officer of pharaoh a
[59:05] military man captain of the Guard an
[59:10] Egyptian bought him of the hands of the
[59:13] Israelite which had brought him down
[59:17] there you might be seated so it's clear
[59:20] that this boy was bought not in a
[59:22] civilian
[59:24] home he was taken into a military
[59:28] home amen amen God kept something going
[59:32] on there until they needed a slave for
[59:34] some reason and God knew that the best
[59:37] home for Joseph for his preparation for
[59:40] his training yes he has to be under a
[59:43] military home amen if you take him in a
[59:47] home different than a military home it's
[59:49] not going to work he needed that home as
[59:51] a preparation for his future position
[59:54] amen amen and the Lord was with
[59:58] Joseph is something ringing and he was a
[1:00:01] prosperous man and he was in the house
[1:00:04] of his master the Egyptian and his
[1:00:07] master saw that the Lord was with him
[1:00:10] and that the Lord made all that he did
[1:00:13] to prosper into his hand and Joseph
[1:00:16] found Grace in the in his sight and he
[1:00:20] served
[1:00:24] God he served who
[1:00:28] he was serving his
[1:00:33] master praise God he served
[1:00:38] partar amen he serve his master
[1:00:44] partar but God was in
[1:00:47] him but he must serve
[1:00:50] partar amen
[1:00:53] amen uh I'm inan verse four he served
[1:00:56] him and he made him overseer over his
[1:01:00] house and all that he had he put into
[1:01:05] his hand are we there drop a little bit
[1:01:08] to verse S it's not on your reading but
[1:01:10] let me read something there and it came
[1:01:13] to pass after these things that his
[1:01:15] master's Wife cast her eyes upon Joseph
[1:01:19] and she said lie with me but he refused
[1:01:23] he refused and say to his master 's wife
[1:01:26] behold my master knows not what he is
[1:01:29] with me in the house and he has
[1:01:31] committed all that he has to my hand
[1:01:34] there is none greater in this house than
[1:01:37] I neither has he kept back anything from
[1:01:40] me but you because you are his wife how
[1:01:44] then can I do this great wickedness and
[1:01:48] sin against God so in your training
[1:01:52] you're going to be
[1:01:53] challenged and as you challenge
[1:01:56] the way you react is going to determine
[1:01:59] your future
[1:02:01] position are we there because brother
[1:02:04] brandham says this I'm going to remind
[1:02:06] you this in the message adoption part
[1:02:08] three brother brandham say now placing
[1:02:11] the son first thing after the son was in
[1:02:15] he become a son but then we found out
[1:02:18] his behavior amen is what set him to
[1:02:23] adoption whether he behave right right
[1:02:26] or not so when you're going on the
[1:02:29] training somebody's watching you and
[1:02:32] your behavior will determine your
[1:02:34] adoption you can dodge it but you're not
[1:02:37] going to be adopted the way God wants
[1:02:39] you to be adopted so whenever you go
[1:02:41] through this training make sure you
[1:02:43] check your behavior because God is
[1:02:46] preparing you for something bigger amen
[1:02:49] let's go to the Book of Joshua chapter
[1:02:53] one glory to God
[1:02:57] Joshua chapter
[1:02:59] 1 verse one very familiar
[1:03:05] scripture my translator you there okay

[1:03:11] amen it's always the devil
[1:03:17] somehow he love
[1:03:19] visibility yeah he loves somebody to see
[1:03:22] that he's there or talk about him that's
[1:03:26] the
[1:03:29] problem
[1:03:32] amen visibility is
[1:03:35] a is a terrible
[1:03:39] Spirit he won't keep you sitting on your
[1:03:43] chair in a public
[1:03:46] place it's a spirit that will always
[1:03:49] always push you to be upfront to be
[1:03:52] known and you're going to get in trouble
[1:03:56] in other words you are
[1:03:58] NC you can't be tame it's a visibility
[1:04:05] spirit amen am if they call you
[1:04:08] somewhere you sit down you will go this
[1:04:10] way and go back this way you go this way
[1:04:12] until the whole party knows who you are
[1:04:19] [Laughter]
[1:04:22] visibility amen I don't know why you
[1:04:25] came all always have to deliver what I
[1:04:28] have to
[1:04:30] deliver
[1:04:33] amen Joshua 1 verse
[1:04:37] one glory to God if you thereare you can
[1:04:40] say
[1:04:41] Amen Jesus say when you go somewhere sit
[1:04:45] in the
[1:04:46] back and let the
[1:04:50] the the chief of the party take you and
[1:04:53] say ah you don't sit here you go there
[1:04:56] then everybody look at you they say
[1:04:57] who's that man but if you put yourself
[1:05:00] into another seat Jesus said they will
[1:05:02] come and say I'm sorry sir but this is
[1:05:04] not reserved for you and you have to
[1:05:07] bear the
[1:05:09] shame amen am
[1:05:13] okay all right let me leave visibility
[1:05:15] alone let me go to verse one now after
[1:05:18] the death of
[1:05:20] Moses the servant of who the lord of the
[1:05:24] Lord it came to pass that the Lord spoke
[1:05:29] to who Josh his volume is not there and
[1:05:32] the Lord spoke to Joshua amen the son of
[1:05:37] none come God's minister
[1:05:44] no are we together so Joshua was the
[1:05:47] minister of who
[1:05:53] Moses Joshua
[1:05:57] why is he not the minister of
[1:06:03] God why is Joshua not the minister of
[1:06:06] God they say Moses the servant of the
[1:06:09] Lord but when they say josua they didn't
[1:06:12] say the servant of the
[1:06:16] Lord the servant of
[1:06:23] Moses amen amen
[1:06:28] so before you can become the servant of
[1:06:33] God amen amen you must be the servant of
[1:06:37] Moses
[1:06:44] amen don't worry my friend in Exodus
[1:06:49] 24:3 the Bible says and Moses rose up
[1:06:54] and his Minister uhuh who Joshua and
[1:06:59] Moses went up into the Mount of who of
[1:07:01] God so Joshua was first Moses Minister
[1:07:07] am Amen in number 11: 28 the Bible say
[1:07:13] and Joshua the son of Nan Kama serve the
[1:07:17] servant of God of
[1:07:22] Moses am I reading a different Bible no
[1:07:24] sir so so don't start this way Moses the
[1:07:28] Joshua the servant of who Moses one of
[1:07:31] his young men answered and say my Lord
[1:07:34] Moses forbid them and in judges 2 ver8
[1:07:38] the Bible say and Joshua the son of n
[1:07:42] Kama the servant of the Lord so there
[1:07:46] was a time that Joshua have to be first
[1:07:49] the servant of Moses amen then after a
[1:07:52] while he became the servant of God am
[1:07:55] but even when he was the servant of
[1:07:57] Moses he was still the servant of God
[1:08:00] Amen but he was the servant of God under
[1:08:03] the jurisdiction of Moses that's why
[1:08:06] Paul say follow me as I follow Christ
[1:08:10] amen so he was not really Moses servant
[1:08:13] he was God's servant through the oaces
[1:08:16] of
[1:08:19] Moses before you became the right hand
[1:08:22] of pharaoh you must be party for servant
[1:08:29] amen are we together we clear so far
[1:08:32] let's go back to the scripture now after
[1:08:35] the death of Moses the
[1:08:38] boss
[1:08:40] py the servant of the Lord it came to
[1:08:43] pass that the Lord spoke to Joshua the
[1:08:47] son of Nan Moses Minister yes saying
[1:08:51] Moses my servant is dead in other words
[1:08:54] your mentor yes is dead it is
[1:08:58] time amen amen Moses my servant is dead
[1:09:03] now therefore arise and go over this
[1:09:06] Jordan you and all these people to the
[1:09:10] land which I do give to them even to the
[1:09:13] children of Israel every place that they
[1:09:17] so of your foot no more the foot of
[1:09:21] Moses amen of your foot shall tread upon
[1:09:26] that have I given to you as I said to
[1:09:30] who Moses so the promise came through
[1:09:33] Moses by the possession through Joshua
[1:09:36] amen are we together amen are we
[1:09:39] together amen if you notice here in
[1:09:42] Exodus chap 24
[1:09:45] verse4 the Bible says let me go back to
[1:09:48] 13 so you grab the concept the Bible
[1:09:51] says and Moses rose up and his minister
[1:09:55] josu
[1:09:56] and Moses went up into the Mount of God
[1:10:01] Amen and he said unto the elders Terry
[1:10:06] ye here for who us not for me us for us
[1:10:12] so Moses was not the only person on the
[1:10:17] mountain Moses went on the mountain with
[1:10:20] Joshua
[1:10:25] we got many thing in trouble because of
[1:10:29] Jehovah witness's books and because of
[1:10:33] movies and because of cartoons because
[1:10:37] some of them stay closer to the Bible
[1:10:39] some of them are completely of the Bible
[1:10:42] amen if you notice if you look at
[1:10:45] Jehovah Witnesses or many books you will
[1:10:47] see that when Moses met God they usually
[1:10:50] draw a big mountain like this and then
[1:10:54] they put a cloud on top of the mountain
[1:10:57] do you know that that's absolutely
[1:11:06] wrong okay let's push the break my
[1:11:08] friend I don't want you to say brother
[1:11:10] stepen say let's go to Exodus
[1:11:19] 24 Lord have
[1:11:22] mercy that's why many denominations idea
[1:11:26] enter into the
[1:11:29] message amen and we find ourselves
[1:11:32] preaching like
[1:11:37] Baptist amen amen let's go to genes or
[1:11:40] Exodus 24 don't wait for prayer we

[1:14:31] the mountain there were not only one
[1:14:34] person only it was two people how many
[1:14:37] days did they stay
[1:14:40] there let me continue you there amen are
[1:14:44] we together amen and the sight of the
[1:14:46] glory of the Lord was like devouring
[1:14:49] fire on top of the water

[1:14:57] fire amen but the cloud covered the
[1:15:00] whole thing are we

[1:15:07] sight of the glory of the Lord was like
[1:15:10] devouring fire on top of the mountain in
[1:15:13] the eyes of the children of who
[1:15:16] Israel and Moses went into the midst of
[1:15:20] the cloud and got him up into the what
[1:15:24] the mountain and Moses was in the M how
[1:15:27] many days 40 days and how many nights 40
[1:15:30] nights how did he
[1:15:35] eat and remember he was not
[1:15:38] alone brother Bram says this glory to
[1:15:41] God brother Bram says in the message
[1:15:44] even event made clear by prophecy he say
[1:15:47] did not did not our heart burn within us
[1:15:51] and does not it burn now to know that we
[1:15:54] are not in the presence of the
[1:15:56] resurrected H Jesus Christ to whom be
[1:16:00] glory and praise how forever more who is
[1:16:03] in the ex in the express image of the
[1:16:06] almighty God Who s down in the form of a
[1:16:10] pillar of fire in the burning bush to
[1:16:13] attract the attention of the Prophet who
[1:16:17] descended who had descended upon the
[1:16:19] mountain that mountain right there and
[1:16:21] anyone that even touch it was to be how
[1:16:25] kill beside who Moses and who and Joshua
[1:16:28] but brother Bram continues here in the
[1:16:31] message the Mighty God unveiled before
[1:16:34] us he said notice Moses had to enter
[1:16:37] this Pillar of
[1:16:39] Fire how alone no one could go with him
[1:16:45] so in this mountain here somehow toward
[1:16:48] the top the pillar of fire that light
[1:16:51] that you see there was there so Moses
[1:16:54] had to L the mountain are you following
[1:16:57] me and enter in the pillar of fire alone
[1:17:01] so there was a stage that Moses went and
[1:17:04] there was a stage that Joshua have to
[1:17:09] stop am are we together so Moses had his
[1:17:15] level and Joshua also had his
[1:17:19] level and the congregation had their
[1:17:22] level
[1:17:25] are you following me the congregation
[1:17:27] were around the mountain Joshua and
[1:17:30] Moses enter but for some reason the only
[1:17:33] one that entered the pillar of fire is
[1:17:36] only Moses not
[1:17:38] Joshua amen hallelujah brother brandham
[1:17:43] say no one could go with him what does
[1:17:46] that speak to us that you don't come
[1:17:50] into this by joining a what Pentecostal
[1:17:53] grou he never revealed it to a group
[1:17:54] group he reveal it to what IND and that
[1:17:58] is the way it is today you say I belong
[1:18:00] to a church I belong to this but I won't
[1:18:02] work and for anyone to try to follow who
[1:18:06] Moses to impersonate that he was how
[1:18:09] dead so remember your limitation
[1:18:12] preacher
[1:18:15] amen don't worry my friend let's go this
[1:18:19] the Bible say as we read in Exodus 24 he
[1:18:22] says Moses went up into the mountain a
[1:18:25] cloud cover the mountain and in
[1:18:27] Deuteronomy 9:9 the Bible says when I
[1:18:31] was gone up into the month to receive
[1:18:34] what the tables of stone even the table
[1:18:36] of the Covenant which the Lord made with
[1:18:38] you then I in the month how many
[1:18:42] days 40 days and what and 40 nights and
[1:18:45] neither did eat bread nor drink what
[1:18:49] water if Moses was in the mountain 40
[1:18:52] days how many days was Joshua there
[1:18:55] days so if Moses did not eat what about
[1:18:58] Joshua did he get food so when you get
[1:19:01] into this mountain whatever happened to
[1:19:04] Moses at some extent happened to you am
[1:19:08] only the level remain
[1:19:13] different Lord help me up glory to God
[1:19:17] brother Bram say remember it he was like
[1:19:20] Manana when Moses went on man what
[1:19:24] happened thunder and lightning and even
[1:19:27] if a cow or a calf or a sheep or anyone
[1:19:32] even touch the mountain he must do what
[1:19:35] die the Bible says so great was the
[1:19:37] Quake till even Moses fear take off your
[1:19:40] shoes your shoes here you are on Holy
[1:19:43] Ground Joshua the great warrior was to
[1:19:47] take the children over and divide their
[1:19:50] inheritance could only come how halfway
[1:19:53] up the mountain
[1:19:56] am amen so on the top of the mountain
[1:19:59] it's Moses halfway is Joshua then down
[1:20:03] here it is the
[1:20:05] congregation are we together amen are we
[1:20:08] together amen this is God's
[1:20:11] order are we there are we there this is
[1:20:15] God's order and you have to remember
[1:20:18] that order am if you try to follow Moses
[1:20:21] you will
[1:20:22] die in other words no preacher in this
[1:20:26] message no minister in this message can
[1:20:30] reach the level of BR
[1:20:35] Bram do you follow me do you follow me
[1:20:39] we can have the same effect of the
[1:20:42] ministry but don't try to mimic brother
[1:20:45] brandham in what he's doing brother
[1:20:48] brandham have no replacement

[1:21:31] on top of
[1:21:35] somebody do you follow me the only one
[1:21:38] we have to repeat in this church is
[1:21:42] William Maran Bram not another
[1:21:46] preacher not another Prophet we might
[1:21:50] have Prophet but they are minor the only
[1:21:54] men
[1:21:55] Prophet is William Mar Bram even if
[1:21:58] brother Bram is dead every other Prophet

[1:24:40] over are we together are we together we
[1:24:44] on Joshua 1 drop to verse
[1:24:47] 5 there shall not any man be able to
[1:24:51] stand before you all the days of your
[1:24:54] life life as I was with her Moses he
[1:24:58] have to be trained by Moses first he
[1:25:01] have to stay under Moses first he have
[1:25:03] to be Moses Minister first because God
[1:25:07] knew he's going to replace
[1:25:09] Moses but you got to be trained by
[1:25:13] Moses if you're going to replace Moses
[1:25:15] you need to be trained by
[1:25:18] Moses to make sure you watch Moses
[1:25:21] correctly because your job is not an
[1:25:24] exodus Moses already initiated the
[1:25:26] Exodus your job is to positionally place
[1:25:30] people in the promised land that is more
[1:25:36] dangerous than even pulling people from
[1:25:39] Exodus are we together
[1:25:41] am the Bible says in verse 5 there shall
[1:25:45] no man we there amen be able to stand
[1:25:49] before you all the days of your life
[1:25:51] amen as I was with who
[1:25:55] so I will be with you I will not fail
[1:25:58] you nor forsake you in other words the
[1:26:01] same Pillar of Fire have to follow you
[1:26:03] amen amen amen verse six be strong and
[1:26:08] of good courage for to this people shall
[1:26:11] you divide an
[1:26:13] inheritance the land which are sold to
[1:26:16] their father to give them this land
[1:26:19] doesn't belong to
[1:26:21] Joshua we already know who owned the
[1:26:23] land right we know their position Joshua
[1:26:26] is only to bring you there and to tell
[1:26:28] you you go this way you take over your
[1:26:30] land that's all are we together verse
[1:26:33] seven only be strong and very courageous
[1:26:38] that you may
[1:26:40] observe to do According to some all all
[1:26:46] what the LA which Moses Moses my servant
[1:26:51] commanded
[1:26:52] you in other words Moses is dead but
[1:26:57] Moses leave a
[1:27:00] message are we together and Joshua who's
[1:27:03] coming in the place of Moses amen must
[1:27:08] bring not a new
[1:27:12] message are we together Mo Joshua must
[1:27:16] stay with the message of Moses
[1:27:19] am and how do you stick with their
[1:27:22] message amen amen glory to God glory to
[1:27:27] God according to all the law which Moses
[1:27:31] my servant commanded you turn
[1:27:34] not from it from the message to the
[1:27:39] right hand or what to the left that you
[1:27:42] may what Prosper wherever you go so the
[1:27:47] prosperity of Joshua Ministry uhhuh
[1:27:51] depend on how accurate
[1:27:54] amen has straight Joshua will stick to
[1:27:58] the message of
[1:28:00] Moses amen if Joshua play a little bit
[1:28:05] with the message it's going to affect
[1:28:07] his
[1:28:08] success so a Joshua Ministry is a
[1:28:12] Ministry that must stick to the prophet
[1:28:16] very tight for the prosperity of the
[1:28:19] ministry and the prosperity of the
[1:28:22] people
[1:28:25] amen are we together amen who is this
[1:28:28] Joshua my friend brother Bram says this
[1:28:31] in the message as I was with Moses so
[1:28:34] will I be with thee he said the church
[1:28:37] organization denomination has fail
[1:28:41] remember when I say denomination leave
[1:28:42] the Baptist alone denomination in the
[1:28:45] message fail this is why we are in the
[1:28:48] message that we are in the message
[1:28:50] because denomination in this message
[1:28:52] Fair we usually call them
[1:28:57] clicks amen and those click bring
[1:29:01] bearers between Ministry so and so
[1:29:04] Ministry I won't communicate with do and
[1:29:06] so Ministry and before you know it that
[1:29:08] Spirit get in the congregation and the
[1:29:11] congregation are completely split
[1:29:13] because of
[1:29:15] denomination theage in the message are
[1:29:18] we together and I have a news for
[1:29:20] denomination it will always fail amen
[1:29:24] denomination has fa they shall not take
[1:29:28] the church how over if you preach this
[1:29:31] message to build a movement you will
[1:29:34] never take the people where God intended
[1:29:36] them to
[1:29:38] be
[1:29:40] God are we together amen are we together
[1:29:43] if you a young Minister Who start
[1:29:45] preaching try to preach to stay let God
[1:29:49] be
[1:29:50] glorified in the life of the people
[1:29:53] don't trust to build any platform those
[1:29:56] that did it fair and the people are
[1:29:59] still hovering
[1:30:02] Devils amen don't worry my friend
[1:30:06] brother Bram say they shall not take the
[1:30:09] church over God will raise up a new what
[1:30:14] system a inter denomination or what
[1:30:19] system in other word I don't belong to
[1:30:21] any
[1:30:22] clicks I can fellowship with with you by
[1:30:25] the power of God that will take the
[1:30:28] church into what the promised land
[1:30:31] organization and denomination has messed
[1:30:34] it up each one after their own what
[1:30:38] theology how many Doctrine pop up in
[1:30:41] this message return Ministry this one
[1:30:44] this one this all of each one after
[1:30:47] their own way of what thinking but God
[1:30:50] will take his Holy Spirit and he will
[1:30:54] say his what Joshua plural
[1:30:57] joshuas that would take the church where
[1:31:00] to the promise with no denomination of
[1:31:04] whatam TI where anywhere that's why I'm
[1:31:08] independent am because when you belong
[1:31:11] to a click you cannot preach outside the
[1:31:14] box if you click if you preach against
[1:31:18] the click you get in trouble all of you
[1:31:20] must line up the certain way that's not
[1:31:23] the way a servant of God must be a

[1:32:06] under
[1:32:08] Joshua's not one
[1:32:10] Joshua they are under
[1:32:15] Moses whenever you clim you won't reach
[1:32:18] today Joshua will stay somewhere amen
[1:32:22] Joshua must stay with with the word amen

[1:32:45] people brother Bram says this in Thea
[1:32:49] Church ages he say in every age we have
[1:32:52] exactly what same pattern that is why
[1:32:55] the light come through what some
[1:32:57] god-given Messengers Moses in a certain
[1:33:00] area and then from that messenger Moses
[1:33:04] they spread the light through what the
[1:33:06] ministry of others Joshua who have been
[1:33:09] what Faithfully taught so to spread the
[1:33:11] light
[1:33:13] correctly you must be Faithfully taught
[1:33:17] you must spend some time being J Moses
[1:33:21] Minister the problem is the one that are
[1:33:24] preaching don't even know what they're

[1:33:30] correctly and they don't know how to
[1:33:33] handle the
[1:33:37] word I'm reading brother Bram brother
[1:33:40] Bram say if the light come from a
[1:33:43] messenger the one who's taking that
[1:33:45] light to spread it must first be

[1:33:51] before you start preaching

[1:34:21] become of that congregation confusion a
[1:34:24] confusion in the congregation and at the
[1:34:27] end of the day the minister leave the

[1:35:55] look where we
[1:35:57] are look where we
[1:36:04] are you take a Jehovah Witness you give
[1:36:08] him a message believe a child he can
[1:36:10] even FL I mean I mean get the child
[1:36:13] whoop left and right and pull him down
[1:36:16] because the child was never been taught
[1:36:19] brother Bram say when Paul preaches the
[1:36:21] gospel he will stick with with that
[1:36:24] person until that person is granted and
[1:36:28] receive the Holy Ghost what have we done
[1:36:33] but there is Joshua Ministry rising up
[1:36:36] where we are taking the people back to
[1:36:38] the Bible back to the message back to
[1:36:42] the scripture gring the people now devil
[1:36:46] come here and even a child will handle
[1:36:50] you left and right it is written it it
[1:36:53] is written it is written it is written
[1:36:57] it is written that's why you built that
[1:37:00] [Applause]
[1:37:07] church don't go to that church they are
[1:37:10] well taught it's a shame you should be
[1:37:13] even happy why you a message believer
[1:37:16] you afraid of another church
[1:37:23] come let Fellowship together and you
[1:37:26] will see how quickly you're going to be
[1:37:29] silenced that's the
[1:37:32] truth before you preach the
[1:37:35] message you need this mentorship my
[1:37:39] friend you need to read the word for
[1:37:43] yourself L you preached the message 40
[1:37:45] years you have not even finished the
[1:37:47] church
[1:37:49] ages what are you preaching
[1:37:55] how many sermon have you listen
[1:37:59] yourself and what no
[1:38:02] input no
[1:38:04] output then we begin to copy one
[1:38:13] another the light come and spread
[1:38:15] through the light of what the ministry
[1:38:17] of others who has been how Faithfully
[1:38:20] taugh but of course all those who go out
[1:38:25] don't always learn how necessary it is
[1:38:29] to what speak only what the what the
[1:38:33] messenger has spoken the law was in
[1:38:36] Moses law really where did the law come
[1:38:40] from he came from almighty God even
[1:38:43] though we say the law of Moses he was
[1:38:45] not the law of Moses we call it the law
[1:38:48] of Moses because the messenger and his
[1:38:51] message are one but it's not the law of
[1:38:54] Moses it's the law of God and in
[1:38:57] Revelation 10 we find a mighty angel
[1:39:00] coming down with an open book that book
[1:39:04] didn't come from
[1:39:07] Jeffersonville I know it's going to
[1:39:09] shock you that book never came from
[1:39:12] Jeffersonville that book came from
[1:39:14] [Applause]
[1:39:20] Heaven do you follow me and he was giv
[1:39:23] to Malachi 4 and he preach it through
[1:39:26] Jeffersonville and what we need to do is
[1:39:29] get that book and eat the book and then
[1:39:32] when you eat the book you need to do
[1:39:35] what how can you preach without eating
[1:39:38] the
[1:39:40] book The Bible say John eat the book
[1:39:43] first then you must do what you yourself
[1:39:46] don't eat the book how do you
[1:39:49] preach why you that's why our sermon are
[1:39:54] and we put stories and stories and
[1:39:57] stories and stories to fill in the blank
[1:40:00] and to play with the emotion we don't
[1:40:03] need emotion you need the medication the
[1:40:07] bomb of gilia which is the word of God
[1:40:11] the message of the
[1:40:15] hour you want a story get a story from
[1:40:19] Brother Bram not from TD ja not from
[1:40:22] Joel
[1:40:23] we got many Parable in the
[1:40:29] message we don't need
[1:40:36] CH what is wrong with
[1:40:42] people I don't know why this came my
[1:40:45] friend but I have to deliver it remember
[1:40:48] Paul warn people to say what only what
[1:40:52] he said First Corinthians 14:37 if what
[1:40:56] if any man think himself to be what a
[1:40:59] prophet or what or spiritual let him
[1:41:01] acknowledge that the things that I do
[1:41:03] what I write unto you are what
[1:41:06] Commandments of the Lord in other word
[1:41:08] me Paul what I told you it's not from me
[1:41:10] it is God commandment and if you are
[1:41:13] spiritual you must remember what Paul
[1:41:16] say and if you are spiritual in this
[1:41:18] message mind what Malachi 4 say
[1:41:23] [Applause]
[1:41:28] hallelujah what can the word of God had
[1:41:31] from you or came it only I mean unto you
[1:41:35] only they do what they add here or they
[1:41:38] what take away there and soon the
[1:41:40] message is no longer what pure and the
[1:41:43] Revival what dies down if it without if
[1:41:46] a Revival died somewhere it means
[1:41:48] somebody didn't keep the message pure
[1:41:51] that's why we are in trouble take the
[1:41:53] law the way it's given give it exactly
[1:41:56] the way it's given I am not under
[1:41:59] commission to change
[1:42:03] prescription prescription are already
[1:42:06] established by a pharmaceutical company
[1:42:09] all I have to do is write you a
[1:42:11] prescription and you go to the pharmacy
[1:42:13] to take
[1:42:16] it I don't fabricate my own medication
[1:42:19] the medication is already there
[1:42:23] and when I give it to you take it
[1:42:26] according to the
[1:42:27] prescription and before you know it you
[1:42:29] say that's a good doctor no it's a
[1:42:32] doctor that know how to stick with the
[1:42:37] book are we together are we together
[1:42:40] that's why the Bible say Joshua stick
[1:42:44] with the
[1:42:45] word amen don't move to the right don't
[1:42:48] move to the left if you want to proph
[1:42:50] stick with the word stay with the
[1:42:56] message and keep that message pure don't
[1:43:00] interject your
[1:43:02] thought you will kill the Revival you
[1:43:04] will kill
[1:43:09] somebody Joshua Joshua Joshua Joshua
[1:43:13] brother Bram say you see after he had
[1:43:16] been he was getting his position then he
[1:43:18] was to be the what greatest military man
[1:43:21] that ever been on the face of the Earth
[1:43:24] there is never been a general like who
[1:43:27] like Joshua no time no age nowhere has
[1:43:32] ever been compared to who with Joshua
[1:43:35] the word Joshua come from the word of
[1:43:37] what Jesus which means what Jesus which
[1:43:40] means Jesus or savior or what deler
[1:43:44] Joshua himself was a military man yes
[1:43:48] amen but he have to stay under Authority
[1:43:51] remember the Roman San was a military
[1:43:54] man and he recognized the authority of
[1:43:57] Jesus because he was a man under
[1:44:00] Authority remember Cornelius was a
[1:44:02] military man so all the opening of the
[1:44:06] Gentile pipe started with military man
[1:44:09] the greatest Faith was recognized by a
[1:44:12] centurion a military man the Holy Ghost
[1:44:15] enter into a gentile by a military home
[1:44:18] Joseph went to Egypt in a military home
[1:44:21] and Joshua was a mil
[1:44:28] man are we together are we together are
[1:44:32] we
[1:44:33] together listen to brother BR my friend
[1:44:36] he said I think tonight one of the
[1:44:39] greatest what general of that America
[1:44:42] has ever had was who Stonewall Jackson I
[1:44:45] believe there is never been a general
[1:44:48] that is like him since Joshua
[1:44:54] so from Joshua no
[1:44:58] one can be to the level of Joshua except
[1:45:02] stwall I'm reading brother Brown my
[1:45:05] friend amen
[1:45:07] why was
[1:45:09] he done that amen he was a what a gall
[1:45:15] man he was a man of what prayer he
[1:45:18] closed up what everything even made all
[1:45:21] his General and everything don't even
[1:45:24] eat a what breakfast or what or nothing
[1:45:27] and lay on their face and do what seek
[1:45:30] God yes
[1:45:32] sir The Secret of stone world was
[1:45:40] prayer brother Bram continue he said
[1:45:44] General Grant was a what a drunk alcohol
[1:45:47] but Stone W Jackson was a what Christian
[1:45:50] gentleman and he loved the book of
[1:45:53] Joshua and he wanted to be like who like
[1:45:56] Joshua and God give him the desire of
[1:45:59] his
[1:46:00] [Applause]
[1:46:02] heart who do you want to be
[1:46:05] like I want to be like
[1:46:08] Jesus and if God can give stone wall his
[1:46:11] desire how much more
[1:46:17] youall Hallelujah are we together are we
[1:46:20] together are we together brother Bram
[1:46:23] say and one day he was asked why is it
[1:46:27] Mr Jackson that you can stand in such
[1:46:30] What opposition so many men how against
[1:46:34] and you take a what a little handful and
[1:46:38] stand in other words the army of J of
[1:46:42] stwall was not a big
[1:46:45] army amen so the size of the
[1:46:50] congregation is not what makes the
[1:46:52] problem
[1:46:55] [Music]
[1:46:57] amen the reason why the question came is
[1:47:01] because when they look at the
[1:47:03] congregation and they look at the
[1:47:05] accomplishment they don't see that they
[1:47:07] don't understand they say how can you be
[1:47:09] so small and you accomplishing this
[1:47:12] thing like
[1:47:13] this and everybody's against you and you
[1:47:17] are standing in the midst of opposition
[1:47:20] a Joshua Ministry that doesn't care
[1:47:23] about
[1:47:26] opposition as long as what I'm doing is
[1:47:29] in the will of God I don't care about
[1:47:32] opposition though my enemy be round
[1:47:36] about me yet in my I will be confident
[1:47:40] David say don't an army stand around me
[1:47:43] it's not a problem the Lord is my
[1:47:46] help the heart is the strength
[1:47:51] [Applause]
[1:47:54] sometime you have to stand alone you
[1:47:56] have to stand yourself you have to make
[1:47:59] a stand yourself and you going to say
[1:48:05] people it's not the majority
[1:48:08] not Moses was one person but he had God
[1:48:13] and he took the whole Army and wiped it
[1:48:17] completely look where God is and stand
[1:48:19] with God that's what is important
[1:48:24] s wall how can you be a small group like
[1:48:28] this and you are standing opposition
[1:48:31] what is your strength my friend brother
[1:48:34] Bram say he was a very
[1:48:37] what little a short fellow kind of
[1:48:40] blueeyed and Wild dark hair he kick his
[1:48:43] boot on the dust and he say I never put
[1:48:46] a glass of water to my mouth without
[1:48:48] doing what thanking almighty God
[1:48:50] thanking almighty God there is where he
[1:48:53] comes from that's right there is where
[1:48:56] the secret what where is the secret
[1:48:59] spoken word trusting who God and being
[1:49:02] led by what the spirit of God not led by
[1:49:06] men but the spirit of the Lord because
[1:49:09] those that are children of God are led
[1:49:11] by the spirit of God if the Lord is
[1:49:14] leading you even if there is a mountain
[1:49:17] that mountain will be
[1:49:20] removed because before the go before God
[1:49:23] lead you to a mountain he already seen
[1:49:26] that mountain so if he's moving you to
[1:49:28] the mountain don't worry he will make
[1:49:31] [Applause]
[1:49:36] away how can God take Israel and Lead
[1:49:39] Israel toward the hero
[1:49:42] sea was there any Bo
[1:49:45] there was there a submarine there
[1:49:48] brother Bram say it looks like God was a
[1:49:51] bad General but the Red Sea have a
[1:49:54] two-fold
[1:49:56] purpose the first purpose is to let
[1:49:59] Israel cross and the second purpose is
[1:50:01] to wipe the enemy that mountain that
[1:50:04] you're going through have a due
[1:50:07] purpose God will make you pass through
[1:50:10] but he will also destroy your enemy so
[1:50:14] whichever way you Le I will follow go I
[1:50:17] walk in the midst of the Valley of the
[1:50:21] shadow of death I feel no evil because
[1:50:25] you are with me your road and your staff

[1:50:31] shepher I shall not want glory to

[2:48:51] that in the ministry of Christ how God
[2:48:54] prepared Jesus
[2:48:56] Christ Lord's willing and you will see
[2:48:59] that we move from there into a prisoner
[2:49:01] Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching
[2:49:04] you
[2:49:05] humbly this afternoon father thanking
[2:49:08] you once again for your grace for your
[2:49:11] love for your mercy and for everything
[2:49:13] you have been doing for us father soon
[2:49:16] as we get here your your spirit take us

[2:49:28] we thank you for speaking to us and we
[2:49:31] pray that you help us Lord father when
[2:49:33] we ignorant we did things differently we
[2:49:37] didn't know probably we reacted the
[2:49:40] wrong way probably we reacted a
[2:49:43] different way of work or maybe in school
[2:49:46] or things like that not even
[2:49:48] understanding that all the footstep of
[2:49:50] the righteous were ordered by you but
[2:49:53] now that you are unfolding and revealing
[2:49:55] these things Lord we begin to be careful
[2:49:58] how we treat our employee how we talk to
[2:50:01] the supervisor how we serve you how we
[2:50:04] take our homes how we take our job the
[2:50:08] way we behave in school because now we
[2:50:11] begin to understand that our life here
[2:50:13] on Earth it's a journey for a purpose
[2:50:16] and it's not our purpose it is yourp
[2:50:18] purpose that you predestinated us and
[2:50:21] you are working everything together
[2:50:24] father to prepare us Lord for that
[2:50:26] purpose and once the purpose is

[2:50:31] at his death he met his mission and he
[2:50:34] went back lord not as somebody who lost
[2:50:38] but as somebody who accomplished his

[2:50:43] and his death than all the days of his
[2:50:45] life Lord father you prepare him all the
[2:50:48] way for that final moment where the two
[2:50:51] pillars of D unbelief and doubt have to
[2:50:54] be crushed together and Lord father
[2:50:56] because those are the two pillars where
[2:50:58] the devil sit down on them and he have
[2:51:00] to crush only two pillar and the whole
[2:51:02] building was taken down father Lord
[2:51:05] Jesus Christ may you help us may you
[2:51:07] continue with us Lord and Ponder with us
[2:51:09] on our meditation so that we can see
