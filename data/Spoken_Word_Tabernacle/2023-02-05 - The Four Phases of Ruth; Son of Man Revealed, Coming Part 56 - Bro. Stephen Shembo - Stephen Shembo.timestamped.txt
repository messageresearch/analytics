[42:34] Catholic message
[42:36] where the priests have everything and
[42:38] the congregation do nothing
[42:40] that's not the message of the hour we
[42:43] have the same material the same Bible
[42:45] the same resources so it's your duty as
[42:48] a Believer to be able to read the
[42:50] message to listen to the tab the same as
[42:53] we do so when we're preaching we are
[42:55] together on the same page
[42:57] amen even though you don't understand
[42:59] something then the Holy Spirit when he
[43:02] quickens that portion of the word that
[43:04] you already have in you it's going to be
[43:06] easier for you to catch it so I will
[43:09] encourage you
[43:11] it's not a good habit for your hand to
[43:13] be always down
[43:15] okay

[59:05] anybody else
[59:07] clear
[59:17] praise God anyone
[59:21] okay
[59:23] let's go to our scripture Genesis
[59:26] chapter 18.
[59:30] glory to God
[59:34] verse 1 if you dare you can say amen
[59:37] amen Oh Glory to God
[59:43] and the Lord
[59:44] remember on Sunday
[59:47] appeared
[59:49] to him
[59:50] in the plains of memory
[59:52] and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat
[59:56] of the day God appeared
[1:00:00] we need to work with some words today
[1:00:04] God appeared to Abraham
[1:00:08] amen
[1:00:09] that's the first thing we can see there
[1:00:12] is an appearance of God
[1:00:14] but that appearance
[1:00:16] God made himself flesh
[1:00:20] not in Jesus the man
[1:00:24] okay
[1:00:30] verse 2 and he lift up his eyes and look
[1:00:34] and low
[1:00:36] three men stood by him
[1:00:39] and when he saw them he run to meet them
[1:00:43] from the tent door and bow himself
[1:00:47] toward the ground you might be seated
[1:00:49] and say my Lord
[1:00:52] so the one who appeared we know it's the
[1:00:56] Lord
[1:00:58] which we understand now that it's Elohim
[1:01:02] everybody okay
[1:01:04] thank you glory to God and say my Lord
[1:01:08] if now I have found favor in your sight
[1:01:11] pass not away
[1:01:13] I pray from your servant job to verse 9.
[1:01:20] he came you know the story eating and
[1:01:23] everything he says and they say to him
[1:01:26] where is Sarah your wife and he say
[1:01:29] behold in the tent I explained this last
[1:01:32] week
[1:01:33] and he say I will certainly water return
[1:01:36] so after the appearing God have to leave
[1:01:42] and who turn
[1:01:46] so there is an appearance
[1:01:49] in appearing and a return
[1:01:52] but when he returned we don't know
[1:01:56] amen there is only one way you would
[1:01:59] know that God return how are you going
[1:02:02] to know
[1:02:03] and he said I will certainly return to
[1:02:06] you according to the time of what life
[1:02:11] the time of life is not one day
[1:02:15] so we don't know which day but we can
[1:02:18] now calibrate
[1:02:20] everybody okay
[1:02:22] glory to God and Lord Sarah your wife
[1:02:25] shall have a water the Sun so if Sarah
[1:02:28] got pregnant
[1:02:31] it means that God return
[1:02:36] everybody okay but Sarah cannot get
[1:02:38] pregnant because she's already old
[1:02:41] stricken in years
[1:02:43] the Bible says and Sarah heard it in the
[1:02:46] tent door which was behind him
[1:02:51] now Abraham and Sarah were old and well
[1:02:54] watered shrickening in other words there
[1:02:57] is no way Grandma can have a baby
[1:03:01] but if you see Grandma changing
[1:03:05] and becoming Young
[1:03:09] amen then you know God return
[1:03:14] so if this return is not a public return
[1:03:19] everybody okay it is a secret return
[1:03:24] and it's a return that will be
[1:03:27] accompanied with a body change
[1:03:31] correcting
[1:03:33] the bareness of Sarah
[1:03:35] because Sarah now is not just going to
[1:03:38] be a young woman because if Sarah is
[1:03:41] only turned to a young woman she's going
[1:03:43] to be Barren again
[1:03:45] everybody okay because she was young and
[1:03:48] buried so the changing doesn't change
[1:03:50] her only to normal but I mean to be
[1:03:54] young but it changed also Sarah by
[1:03:56] correcting whatever was wrong in her
[1:04:00] body
[1:04:01] we okay now
[1:04:03] praise the name of the Lord
[1:04:06] while streaking in age verse 11 and he
[1:04:09] sees to be with Sarah after the manner
[1:04:12] of water woman women
[1:04:15] plural amen
[1:04:17] you know what he means job to verse 14.
[1:04:22] is anything
[1:04:24] too hard for the Lord
[1:04:26] at the time water appointed I will water
[1:04:30] return so God knows that time himself
[1:04:34] he didn't say to Abraham I will return
[1:04:37] in January the 23rd he didn't say that
[1:04:40] he himself knows and it's a specific
[1:04:43] time it's a specific date it's a time
[1:04:47] appointed
[1:04:53] it's specific but known only to God
[1:04:58] not everybody amen
[1:05:01] in other words you stay on the
[1:05:03] expectation one of this day I will
[1:05:06] return When
[1:05:08] you don't know I don't know but if you
[1:05:11] stay on the expectation that day you
[1:05:14] will not take you anywhere
[1:05:16] you can tell that hey Abraham what's
[1:05:18] going on
[1:05:19] somebody's here you turn around oh I'm
[1:05:21] looking different then you know the
[1:05:24] master is back everybody okay that was
[1:05:27] verse 14 at the appointed time I will
[1:05:30] return to you according to the time of
[1:05:32] life we already went through this the
[1:05:34] number 28 and Sarah shall have a son if
[1:05:40] you notice Sarah was married all along
[1:05:43] but never had a song despite how many
[1:05:47] Intimate Relationships she had with her
[1:05:49] husband zero the son only come after
[1:05:54] the appearing of the Lord
[1:05:57] everybody okay roof was married before
[1:06:03] did she has a baby
[1:06:05] she only have a baby with Boaz
[1:06:09] after she received the sixth measure of
[1:06:11] barley then boys return to pick her up
[1:06:15] that's when rufa got a baby
[1:06:18] we okay now
[1:06:20] praise the Lord
[1:06:23] put the election behind you
[1:06:26] okay just relax
[1:06:28] and the Lord please and the Lord say
[1:06:30] because the Cry of Sodom verse 20 and
[1:06:34] Gomorrah is great and because their sin
[1:06:38] is very water Grievous
[1:06:43] God
[1:06:44] was coming to destroy
[1:06:47] Sodom and Gomorrah you know the story
[1:06:50] so this coming
[1:06:53] disappearing of the Lord
[1:06:55] amen when he finished with Abraham
[1:06:59] God went and destroyed Sodom
[1:07:02] so it's an appearing that is coupled
[1:07:05] with judgment
[1:07:10] you will need this thing
[1:07:13] let's go to John chapter 12.
[1:07:22] mm-hmm
[1:07:28] Oh Glory to God
[1:07:33] thank you Jesus you dare you can say
[1:07:36] amen amen verse 23.
[1:07:39] and Jesus answered them saying the hour
[1:07:44] is come that the who son of man should
[1:07:47] be how glorified we know the son of man
[1:07:50] have two forms
[1:07:52] now we're clear on that one
[1:07:55] the son of man
[1:07:58] need to be glorified
[1:08:00] and we know the son of man have to form
[1:08:03] his first water what the word which we
[1:08:07] call the logos
[1:08:09] which we call the theophany which we
[1:08:11] call the pillar of Fire
[1:08:14] everybody okay and Melchizedek Etc or he
[1:08:18] is the flesh
[1:08:20] which we know is the body
[1:08:23] which we call the corporal
[1:08:28] everybody okay
[1:08:32] he says the son of man should be
[1:08:34] glorified
[1:08:36] jump to verse 27 I'm skipping you can
[1:08:39] read this at home yourself
[1:08:42] now is my soul trouble and what shall I
[1:08:46] say father save me from this hour but
[1:08:50] for this cause came I to this hour
[1:08:54] verse 28 father
[1:08:57] glorify your name
[1:08:59] if you notice in verse 23 he said the
[1:09:03] son of man which is the man Jesus Christ
[1:09:06] must be glorified
[1:09:08] but if you see here he say glorify your
[1:09:11] name
[1:09:15] everybody okay
[1:09:18] we got the person
[1:09:24] and we got the name
[1:09:28] amen
[1:09:29] it's not complicated my friend
[1:09:32] he said father
[1:09:34] glorify your name verse 28. then came
[1:09:39] there a voice from Heaven saying a voice
[1:09:42] you remember this from Sunday I have
[1:09:44] both water glorify it so the name of God
[1:09:48] was already glorified
[1:09:51] because remember when he was created he
[1:09:54] was created better than angels you
[1:09:56] remember that and he was giving a name
[1:09:59] better than the name of the angel
[1:10:01] that's why even the disciple when they
[1:10:04] were sent they came back rejoicing
[1:10:07] saying Master we noticed something when
[1:10:10] we cast our devil in your name something
[1:10:13] is happening so the name of Jesus was
[1:10:16] already glorified
[1:10:18] everybody okay
[1:10:20] I have both glorified comma and I will
[1:10:26] glorify it how again so the name must be
[1:10:31] glorified again
[1:10:35] are we together
[1:10:40] the people therefore that stood by and
[1:10:43] heard it say that he thundered so the
[1:10:46] voice is a thunder and others say an
[1:10:49] angel spoke to him so the voice is a
[1:10:52] thunder it's an angel we clear on that
[1:10:54] one everybody okay
[1:11:00] go to chapter 13. let me skip this
[1:11:08] because Jesus is saying the son of man
[1:11:11] the person is going to be glorified then
[1:11:14] he says the name is going to be
[1:11:16] glorified
[1:11:20] if you're on chapter 13 you can say amen
[1:11:22] amen verse 31.
[1:11:25] therefore when it
[1:11:28] when he was gone gone out Jesus said now
[1:11:33] everybody okay
[1:11:35] is the Hope son of man how glorified
[1:11:40] another word the name and the person
[1:11:43] goes together
[1:11:47] everybody okay you cannot magnify or
[1:11:51] glorify the person without exalting his
[1:11:55] name
[1:11:57] everybody okay everybody okay when Jesus
[1:12:01] was both glorified here the son of man
[1:12:04] his name already was also glorified
[1:12:08] amen but God said that he will glorify
[1:12:11] his name again meaning that he's going
[1:12:14] to glorify the person again
[1:12:19] everybody okay
[1:12:21] the Bible says this in the book of act
[1:12:25] that John say on verse 7 chapter 7 verse
[1:12:29] 39 but this speak he of the water spirit
[1:12:32] which they that believe on him should
[1:12:35] water receive for the Holy Ghost was not
[1:12:39] yet how given because that Jesus was not
[1:12:42] yet what glorified but Jesus is saying
[1:12:45] here that I he already have glorified
[1:12:47] him
[1:12:48] foreign
[1:12:50] can we read it again verse 31 therefore
[1:12:54] when he was gone out Jesus said now not
[1:12:57] in the future
[1:12:58] is the son of man how glorified and God
[1:13:02] is glorified in water in him so Jesus
[1:13:05] was already glorified the first time
[1:13:07] which glorify his name everybody okay
[1:13:10] but there is a second glorification
[1:13:12] watch verse 32 if God be glorifying him
[1:13:17] God shall future a second glorification
[1:13:21] everybody okay
[1:13:23] shy also glorify him in water himself
[1:13:27] and shall immediately glorify water him
[1:13:30] so there is two glorification
[1:13:33] we okay now that's why the Bible says
[1:13:36] here that he's going to be glorified
[1:13:38] after his glorification that's when the
[1:13:41] Holy Ghost comes that's not the first
[1:13:43] glorification because I have both
[1:13:45] glorify him and I will glorify him again
[1:13:51] everybody okay
[1:13:53] the Bible says in the book of act 3
[1:13:57] after the Holy Ghost came on act two
[1:13:59] right okay when the Holy Ghost come it
[1:14:02] means that Jesus is what glorified so
[1:14:04] act three is after act two the god of
[1:14:08] Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob the
[1:14:11] god of our father has done water
[1:14:13] glorified his son who Jesus so the first
[1:14:17] glorification
[1:14:18] happen during your life
[1:14:22] you remember the son of man and
[1:14:24] glorification but the second
[1:14:25] glorification happened at the
[1:14:28] resurrection
[1:14:30] when his body have changed
[1:14:34] everybody okay the first glorification
[1:14:36] touches your soul the first translation
[1:14:39] touches your soul the first change you
[1:14:42] receive touches your soul the first
[1:14:45] Rapture you receive
[1:14:49] I have the quote you are raptured first
[1:14:52] in your soul that's why you live above
[1:14:55] the things of the world
[1:14:57] that's why you don't belong to this
[1:14:58] world again
[1:14:59] that's why you became air traveling a
[1:15:03] stranger a pilgrim on this Earth because
[1:15:06] inside of you you are from another world
[1:15:10] everybody okay but you need to be also
[1:15:13] glorified translate change on the
[1:15:17] outside
[1:15:18] amen and when Jesus was glorified the
[1:15:22] second time the Bible says this
[1:15:27] Philippians 2 verse 8 and 11 and being
[1:15:30] found in a fashion as a man he did what
[1:15:34] humble himself and became how obedient

[1:16:44] the demon are subject to you
[1:16:46] but your neighbor is not afraid of you
[1:16:49] that's right
[1:16:51] your boss at work doesn't feel you

[1:17:00] time yet

[1:17:13] everybody okay then you never would know
[1:17:15] who you are
[1:17:17] look at the second glorification
[1:17:21] after the death of the Cross amen what

[1:17:26] in other words as a result of this God
[1:17:29] also has water highly exalt him
[1:17:33] everybody okay and giving him a water
[1:17:36] which is above water every name which he
[1:17:39] already has

[1:26:54] verse 27 the son of man is coming

[1:27:37] God is saying that among my disciples
[1:27:41] some of them won't die
[1:27:45] until the sea
[1:27:47] the son of man coming in his Water
[1:27:51] Kingdom
[1:27:52] who's speaking Jesus Christ
[1:27:55] so some of the disciples must see that
[1:28:00] we okay
[1:28:01] let's go to chapter 17.
[1:28:04] verse 1.
[1:28:06] glory to God
[1:28:08] father please help me with time
[1:28:13] foreign
[1:28:14] this is not something I have to preach
[1:28:16] and cut off
[1:28:18] okay it is loaded for Generation until
[1:28:22] the Rapture it will help you up
[1:28:26] you there amen first one and after how
[1:28:30] many days six days stop
[1:28:33] [Applause]
[1:28:38] the first day
[1:28:40] [Applause]
[1:28:41] recognizing you and each one message on
[1:28:46] the Book of Genesis chapter one a day
[1:28:49] was called a light
[1:28:51] [Applause]
[1:28:54] so Jesus waited the first day the second
[1:28:58] day the third day the fourth day the
[1:29:02] sixth and the fifth day the sixth day
[1:29:05] after that
[1:29:07] after the sixth day
[1:29:09] we can argue
[1:29:11] eight is after six right no no not oh
[1:29:15] yes eight is after six that's correct
[1:29:18] nine is after six a hundred is after six
[1:29:22] a thousand is after six one million is
[1:29:26] after six
[1:29:27] all we know here ask the water six days
[1:29:30] let's stop there
[1:29:33] [Applause]
[1:29:36] God after sixth day is bringing how many
[1:29:40] disciple three disciple
[1:29:43] in other words this coming
[1:29:46] Jesus is now fulfilling it
[1:29:49] because he says some of you won't die
[1:29:52] I'm gonna until they see me how coming
[1:29:55] now he's fulfilling it
[1:29:57] but this happened after 60.
[1:30:07] glory to God verse one and after sixth
[1:30:11] day Jesus Takes hope Peter and who James
[1:30:14] and who John how many three he fulfilled
[1:30:17] some
[1:30:20] at the beginning when Jesus says some
[1:30:22] everybody can speculate you can say 10
[1:30:25] disciple to disciple five disciple is
[1:30:28] some but now the son must be through him
[1:30:34] everybody okay you cannot bring us in
[1:30:36] full because Jesus picked the son
[1:30:39] so let's repeat Jesus three disciples
[1:30:42] I'm gonna I'm not gonna even touch them
[1:30:45] because it's a problem with their name
[1:30:48] who they are let's stay on the surface
[1:30:50] everybody okay
[1:30:52] everybody okay
[1:30:57] some of them are the sons of Thunders
[1:31:01] but let me leave it alone okay
[1:31:06] the boss is is moving here
[1:31:09] everybody okay
[1:31:12] and he took them and brother and bring
[1:31:15] them up to a water high mountain
[1:31:18] are you following me
[1:31:19] are you following me in other words
[1:31:22] Jesus is not fulfilling this
[1:31:24] he's fulfilling this
[1:31:27] because some of you must see me
[1:31:30] verse 2 and he was how transfigurated
[1:31:33] trash figure
[1:31:35] metamorphosis
[1:31:39] that's what the scripture says
[1:31:43] you know the Frog you remember the Frog
[1:31:46] okay so somebody's changing remember the
[1:31:50] Jesus that is climbing in the mountain
[1:31:53] is a human being
[1:31:56] I'm going slowly
[1:31:58] are we okay
[1:32:01] [Applause]
[1:32:04] so the Jesus that is going to fulfill
[1:32:07] this is a corporal
[1:32:10] he's a human being
[1:32:13] relax my friend
[1:32:15] it's a human being
[1:32:18] a human Jesus a flesh Jesus a natural
[1:32:22] Jesus glory to God
[1:32:26] and that natural Jesus begin to change
[1:32:32] are you following me he was transfigured
[1:32:35] before them and his water face shine as
[1:32:39] the water so when Jesus was changed
[1:32:43] Hallelujah
[1:32:45] his face
[1:32:47] begin to rise yet like the sun
[1:32:50] [Applause]
[1:32:52] you need to know who you're gonna see
[1:32:55] and how you gonna see him
[1:33:00] [Music]
[1:33:03] I want to see my husband buddy
[1:33:06] so when I mean the cloud I say that's
[1:33:08] him right there
[1:33:09] [Applause]
[1:33:10] everybody okay I don't want to guess
[1:33:13] so his face
[1:33:15] look like water the Sun remember that
[1:33:21] and
[1:33:23] his water
[1:33:24] was white as the water light
[1:33:32] so it's a Jesus natural
[1:33:35] but when you look at him he saw his son
[1:33:38] like the sun and his clothing are like
[1:33:41] light
[1:33:46] his clothing are like the light
[1:33:50] what happened
[1:33:52] I want you to speak the scripture don't
[1:33:54] play with words so when they enter the
[1:33:57] mountain something happened to Jesus
[1:34:00] amen Jesus changed
[1:34:03] follow me carefully
[1:34:05] Jesus is fulfilling he's coming amen
[1:34:09] when he change number one his face
[1:34:12] changed his government changed okay
[1:34:18] discharge trigger something else
[1:34:24] are you following me
[1:34:27] would you give me time I cannot run with
[1:34:30] this
[1:34:31] I have to go slowly what is the trigger
[1:34:37] verse 3 and behold there appear to her
[1:34:41] damn who Moses and water Elias talking
[1:34:45] with water so Moses and Elijah never
[1:34:49] appeared until Jesus changed
[1:34:54] are you following me
[1:34:56] so the change of Jesus activate Moses
[1:35:01] and Elijah
[1:35:03] the Bible didn't say Elijah and Moses
[1:35:10] scripture don't play with words the
[1:35:13] Bible says who Moses and who Elias glory
[1:35:17] to God
[1:35:17] [Applause]
[1:35:20] so this changes when it happened it
[1:35:25] triggered
[1:35:26] Moses
[1:35:28] in other words when Jesus is the human
[1:35:31] being said Moses left where he was
[1:35:36] Elijah also left and they hold the hand
[1:35:39] they come they say what is going on
[1:35:46] [Laughter]
[1:35:49] Elijah
[1:35:51] oh Lord help me
[1:35:54] you there
[1:35:56] you there
[1:35:57] we on verse three we there
[1:36:00] job 2 verse 9.
[1:36:02] and follow I'm skipping
[1:36:04] if you dare you can say amen amen
[1:36:08] verse now and as they come down from the
[1:36:11] mountain you know the remaining of the
[1:36:12] story
[1:36:13] Jesus charged them saying tell the water
[1:36:16] the vision stop
[1:36:20] so what happened in the mountain was the
[1:36:22] water vision
[1:36:27] make sure you got your bubble
[1:36:30] so this is a vision
[1:36:36] Jesus told them that some of you
[1:36:39] won't die until they see who the son of
[1:36:43] man coming in his Water Kingdom and he
[1:36:46] picked Peter John and uh and James and
[1:36:50] showed them a vision and in the vision
[1:36:54] they see Jesus changing and when he
[1:36:57] changed Moses and Elijah comes stop
[1:37:00] right there
[1:37:04] what's going on
[1:37:07] everybody okay
[1:37:09] everybody okay
[1:37:11] until the son of man be risen again from
[1:37:14] the water dead watch
[1:37:16] and his disciple ask him
[1:37:20] saying why them
[1:37:25] they never ask him this question
[1:37:29] so when they were in Monte civilization
[1:37:32] they saw Moses and who Elijah but the
[1:37:36] disciple we're more triggered
[1:37:41] toward Elijah
[1:37:44] are you following me so when they come
[1:37:47] they ask not Moses
[1:37:51] why then says the script that who a lion
[1:37:55] must do whatever
[1:37:58] so this Vision here
[1:38:00] of the coming of the Lord has a
[1:38:04] connection
[1:38:06] with the coming of Elijah
[1:38:11] foreign
[1:38:15] ER
[1:38:19] is perfectly in line with the scripture
[1:38:24] the message and the Bible are one
[1:38:30] everybody okay so there is something to
[1:38:33] do with the coming of God in his kingdom
[1:38:36] bless Elijah
[1:38:38] [Applause]
[1:38:42] but the disciples are saying you show us
[1:38:47] the second coming
[1:38:49] but how can the second coming
[1:38:53] come
[1:38:54] but Elijah must come
[1:38:57] [Music]
[1:39:03] [Laughter]
[1:39:06] if you left this message
[1:39:09] and you sneak in some time to watch me
[1:39:13] to monitor me today is your day
[1:39:17] [Applause]
[1:39:20] keep watching my friend
[1:39:23] I will re-baptize you again
[1:39:27] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:39:31] to accept this message as the Vindicated
[1:39:35] right for this hour
[1:39:37] [Applause]
[1:39:43] we okay
[1:39:46] Jesus now answer verse 11 and Jesus
[1:39:49] answered say to them
[1:39:51] Elijah truly water
[1:39:54] means water
[1:39:57] shall first come and do whatever restore
[1:40:00] all things in other words Jesus said yes
[1:40:04] that coming is coupled with Elijah and
[1:40:08] that Elijah must come first and restore
[1:40:12] water all peace

[1:41:07] or son of man suffer of water damn Jesus
[1:41:11] is saying Elijah came
[1:41:13] and they kill him
[1:41:16] the same way Elijah died that's how
[1:41:20] they're gonna kill me
[1:41:22] which Elijah is this
[1:41:25] let's look at verse 13. then the
[1:41:28] disciple understood
[1:41:32] that he spoke of to them of who John the
[1:41:37] Baptist so John the Baptist is the
[1:41:40] Elijah that was already came and that
[1:41:43] the kill already and Jesus is saying
[1:41:46] they're gonna kill me like they killed
[1:41:48] John the Baptist

[1:42:32] and as a Shepherd I have to make sure I
[1:42:35] don't bust any pipe
[1:42:37] so you need to receive water according
[1:42:39] to the size of your pipe
[1:42:42] okay so I need to look at the pressure
[1:42:46] everybody okay so now me I'm the one
[1:42:48] who's about to bust because I have to
[1:42:52] say to monitor the pressure

[1:43:23] man be water a shame when he shall come
[1:43:28] in his own glory and in his father
[1:43:32] and of the Holy Water Angels now we
[1:43:35] found out that when he come with the
[1:43:38] Holy Angel which coming is it
[1:43:41] again the same scripture the third
[1:43:43] coming
[1:43:44] but remember in Matthew after the third
[1:43:47] coming what follow the second coming
[1:43:49] watch again in Luke
[1:43:51] what is following verse 27 but I tell
[1:43:56] you the truth a contradiction
[1:43:58] that not a contradiction to the
[1:44:00] scripture but something open something
[1:44:01] separate yeah no he said the Bible have
[1:44:04] contradiction ah
[1:44:06] but I tell you a truth
[1:44:09] there'd be some standing where here
[1:44:12] which shall not test death until they
[1:44:15] see the kingdom of water God over here
[1:44:17] he called that the coming in his kingdom
[1:44:20] over there they say the kingdom of who
[1:44:22] God everybody okay
[1:44:25] watch carefully
[1:44:27] verse 28 you there amen and he came to
[1:44:30] pass about
[1:44:33] eight day
[1:44:36] come on now brother
[1:44:39] did you see that
[1:44:41] he came to pass a bad water if they stop
[1:44:45] let's take Matthew and look and let's
[1:44:48] put him together
[1:44:51] are we okay now we okay now you know
[1:44:54] your math right
[1:44:55] according to Matthew it was after six
[1:45:00] days
[1:45:01] amen according to Luke it is about what
[1:45:07] about eight day so which number is
[1:45:10] missing in the middle
[1:45:12] [Music]
[1:45:13] which number is missing seven
[1:45:17] so this event happened on which day
[1:45:20] seventh day
[1:45:24] everybody okay everybody okay but it
[1:45:28] doesn't happen at the beginning of the
[1:45:31] 70.
[1:45:34] it happened when it's about in other
[1:45:38] words almost at the end
[1:45:42] in other words the coming of the Lord in
[1:45:46] the age of laodicea won't be at the
[1:45:49] beginning
[1:45:50] when laodicea is just that bad to be
[1:45:53] finished that's when Jesus Will Come
[1:46:03] [Applause]
[1:46:07] everybody okay now this is the show the
[1:46:10] James let me leave that alone
[1:46:12] I don't want to handle that now
[1:46:14] everybody okay
[1:46:16] everybody okay so the second coming of
[1:46:19] Jesus Christ when it happened it will
[1:46:22] happen not on the first age
[1:46:27] recognizing your day and his message not
[1:46:31] on the first age not on the first
[1:46:33] message not on the second message not on
[1:46:36] the third message it will happen on the
[1:46:38] seventh message toward the end of that
[1:46:42] day
[1:46:43] when it's just about there
[1:46:46] and eight is the number of water so just
[1:46:50] about that time we're gonna blend with
[1:46:54] eternity
[1:46:54] [Applause]

[1:49:05] him Hallelujah Mike that is the way he
[1:49:08] is he's coming in the water Cloud of
[1:49:11] Glory everybody okay now so we found out
[1:49:15] that this is a glorified Jesus
[1:49:23] what does he mean my friend offer in
[1:49:26] this place then he saw the water coming
[1:49:29] all the water rehearsal because he was a
[1:49:32] vision
[1:49:33] God took them and played the movie put
[1:49:37] the tape put the DVD and push play and
[1:49:40] when they look they say oh so this is
[1:49:43] how the second coming will be but if you
[1:49:46] notice it was sealed
[1:49:48] what does Moses mean
[1:49:50] what does Elijah mean
[1:49:55] everybody okay he says what was the
[1:49:59] first
[1:50:01] think he saw the first thing he saw in
[1:50:04] the camp in the coming was who Moses
[1:50:08] represented the water that will be how
[1:50:12] Resurrected
[1:50:17] because Moses died and he rose again
[1:50:21] everybody okay
[1:50:23] so when Jesus demand the human
[1:50:28] cents
[1:50:29] and become glorified
[1:50:32] everybody okay he will pull the scent
[1:50:36] [Music]
[1:50:38] from the graveyard
[1:50:40] everybody okay
[1:50:43] he did it with the Old Testament
[1:50:46] Moses represented the dead center that
[1:50:49] will be resurrected Elijah was standing
[1:50:52] where oh I want you to notice what will
[1:50:55] take place there was who Moses first
[1:50:58] first that is all the water six ages
[1:51:01] that slept the water six Church ages not
[1:51:05] only that but Elijah was the messenger
[1:51:08] of the water last day with his water the
[1:51:12] water
[1:51:14] amen now in the future awaiting the
[1:51:17] water coming
[1:51:18] [Music]
[1:51:20] everybody okay everybody okay
[1:51:24] so now we found out that Moses and
[1:51:27] Elijah represented the church
[1:51:31] Moses represented that scent that I
[1:51:34] Elijah represented those that would not
[1:51:37] die but won't remain until the coming of
[1:51:41] the Lord but they will be changed in the
[1:51:44] twinkling at the trumpet of God or the
[1:51:47] dead of Christ will do what and we
[1:51:50] together will meet the Lord in there
[1:51:52] both of them are represented in what
[1:51:55] Moses and Elijah stop
[1:52:02] the first application of Moses of Elijah
[1:52:06] is the church
[1:52:10] who preached to the hundred and forty
[1:52:12] four thousand
[1:52:13] [Applause]
[1:52:17] so Moses of Elijah have two companies
[1:52:23] everybody okay in other words when Jesus
[1:52:27] the glorified Jesus come
[1:52:30] who Sean likes the Sun and his Remnant
[1:52:34] is like the light that Jesus will first
[1:52:37] Resurrected
[1:52:39] you follow me and then he would change
[1:52:42] those that I love
[1:52:44] everybody okay and then he will also
[1:52:48] open Moses and Elijah to go back to the
[1:52:52] Jewish people are folding the sixth Hill
[1:52:56] okay
[1:53:00] [Applause]
[1:53:02] let's go slowly
[1:53:04] William Marion Branham I do know that
[1:53:08] this Minister behind me may be wondering
[1:53:12] because in water so he was showing the
[1:53:15] water second coming of who Christ that
[1:53:18] is the water we'll wait to approach it
[1:53:21] it is the second coming of Christ
[1:53:22] because Jesus said I will show you none
[1:53:25] of some of you won't die until I show
[1:53:27] you
[1:53:28] brother Branham say for it showed
[1:53:31] Facebook Jesus glorify second the
[1:53:35] message to the water Jews which will be
[1:53:37] the water of Revelation water eleven
[1:53:41] Moses and water and when they look back
[1:53:44] they saw who Jesus only but the word of
[1:53:47] God is so his power
[1:53:50] I guess
[1:53:51] that's the entire water Bible ties
[1:53:55] together on everywhere you could preach
[1:53:58] the water Second Coming you could preach
[1:54:00] water Divine Healing you could preach
[1:54:02] water Resurrection oh anywhere in the
[1:54:05] Bible from any place in the Bible show
[1:54:08] me another book that can produce that
[1:54:13] in other words Moses and Elijah are most
[1:54:17] that directional
[1:54:20] they can be applied to the second coming
[1:54:22] they can also be applied to the two
[1:54:25] witness that is going back to the Jews
[1:54:28] to take the hundred and forty four
[1:54:30] thousand
[1:54:35] help me Father glory to God here is the
[1:54:39] two prophets standing here with the word
[1:54:41] of God to do anything to water the
[1:54:44] nature they want to and they set the
[1:54:46] Earth and it shows exactly who does it
[1:54:49] it is who Moses and who Elijah because
[1:54:52] there is the water Ministry we
[1:54:55] impersonate it again it is who both men
[1:54:58] see what the six seal is it is just what
[1:55:01] prophets don't let it shock you but
[1:55:03] watch what opened that seal the water
[1:55:05] prophets
[1:55:07] why because after the Rapture the blood
[1:55:11] is removed from the Altar and the
[1:55:13] tribulation Period start then Moses and
[1:55:17] Elijah must appear straight ahead and
[1:55:19] begin to bring judgment to the word and
[1:55:22] take the 144 000. everybody okay
[1:55:26] so now we understand the order of the
[1:55:30] second coming
[1:55:31] number one do we must see an appearance
[1:55:34] of the human being Jesus in a glorified
[1:55:37] State he is appearing well where's the
[1:55:41] dead change those that He Love pick up
[1:55:44] the bread and give way to Moses and
[1:55:46] Elijah to go and to stop preaching to
[1:55:49] the Jews and to open the tribulation
[1:55:51] everybody okay so far
[1:55:54] but when they saw Jesus his face shine
[1:55:58] like water the sun opened revelation 10.
[1:56:05] [Music]
[1:56:10] father help me

[2:05:47] because Paul said that our first husband
[2:05:49] also Must Die
[2:05:51] so that we can be married to the next
[2:05:53] husband now that has been Paul is saying
[2:05:57] there is a widow woman and a judge
[2:05:59] and Paul is not oh I'm sorry Jesus is
[2:06:02] applying God himself as the just judge
[2:06:06] he's saying look at the unjust judge God
[2:06:09] who is the child shall he not what

[2:06:24] opposing the way the woman and he is
[2:06:27] justifying the cause of the widow woman
[2:06:30] are you following me
[2:06:33] God as a judge must defend a widow woman
[2:06:38] against her opposite party bring
[2:06:41] judgment on the opposite party and free
[2:06:44] the widow woman everybody okay
[2:06:48] verse 7 and shall not God avenge his own
[2:06:52] water elect so that woman with the woman
[2:06:55] is an elect woman
[2:06:58] are we okay
[2:07:00] an elect woman which cried day and night
[2:07:04] to him though he bear along with them

[2:07:24] when the son of man do what come here
[2:07:27] stop so there is a coming
[2:07:30] of the son of man
[2:07:33] everybody okay and this coming the son
[2:07:36] of man is coming as a judge
[2:07:40] to justify a woman and to attack her
[2:07:44] body
[2:07:45] are you following me are you following
[2:07:48] me the son of man is coming watch
[2:07:53] the son of when the son of man cometh
[2:07:55] comma shall he find water faith on water
[2:07:59] the Earth stop
[2:08:03] Jesus say
[2:08:05] the son of man will be coming we know
[2:08:08] that
[2:08:09] amen we know the son of man who are
[2:08:12] coming in human flesh when he come he
[2:08:14] will be in the air and the resurrection
[2:08:17] will take place and we go to the Rapture
[2:08:19] Jesus is saying the son of man coming
[2:08:21] but Jesus is concerned
[2:08:26] he said the son of man cometh but I
[2:08:30] wanna make sure
[2:08:31] before me coming
[2:08:33] to resurrect descent
[2:08:36] and to translate to the sand I need to
[2:08:39] make sure there is a faith
[2:08:47] this faith is not the faith of healing
[2:08:51] [Applause]
[2:08:55] everybody okay it is a faithful that
[2:08:59] concerned the coming
[2:09:01] [Applause]
[2:09:04] in other words there must be a faith in
[2:09:07] the church that will pull Jesus down
[2:09:10] [Applause]
[2:09:14] that you must be a faith for the coming
[2:09:18] a faith for the rapture
[2:09:21] [Applause]
[2:09:24] everybody okay
[2:09:26] so before the second coming
[2:09:29] Faith must be founded not any kind of
[2:09:33] Faith but rapturing faith
[2:09:37] but Faith cometh by water hearing
[2:09:40] hearing what the word stop in Revelation
[2:09:44] 10. when the angel came he came with a
[2:09:47] book that is what open to produce water
[2:09:50] faith
[2:09:54] Have I Lost You let me start it again
[2:09:58] first cometh by water hearing hearing
[2:10:01] water the world so before Faith Comes A
[2:10:06] word must come to produce let the faith
[2:10:09] [Applause]
[2:10:14] the problem we're trying to find which
[2:10:17] coming is this
[2:10:19] this one we know but Revelation 10
[2:10:23] this one of Matthew
[2:10:25] Matthew and Luke we know it is the
[2:10:29] second coming but Revelation 10 which
[2:10:33] coming is it all we know is a nature
[2:10:36] that came with a book that is what open
[2:10:38] and the book is the Bible that become
[2:10:41] what
[2:10:42] everybody okay and Jesus said before I
[2:10:46] come according to Matthew and look there
[2:10:49] must be a safe
[2:10:52] that's why the disciple were worrying
[2:10:55] about Elijah
[2:10:57] [Applause]
[2:11:00] they say hey we saw Elijah there but
[2:11:03] Elijah must come Jesus said yes Elijah
[2:11:06] will come and restore water all things
[2:11:09] and Jesus now begin to worry about their
[2:11:12] faith
[2:11:13] here
[2:11:15] but Faith cometh by water hearing
[2:11:18] hearing water and in reference in 10 we
[2:11:21] see the mighty angel coming with the
[2:11:23] word
[2:11:25] to produce death
[2:11:28] that is needed for the coming of the
[2:11:32] Lord
[2:11:41] are you there I see some of you like
[2:11:44] this so I don't know where is your
[2:11:46] interest
[2:11:48] everybody okay everybody okay what are
[2:11:52] you trying to say
[2:11:55] brother Branham he says this
[2:11:58] the Bible says this our church did
[2:12:00] before God the Lord Jesus Christ who
[2:12:04] shall what judge
[2:12:06] so the judge is who Christ they're quick
[2:12:09] and the dead add his water appearing
[2:12:12] evil is Water Kingdom stop eight has
[2:12:16] four days laid up for me a crown of
[2:12:18] righteousness which there Lord the
[2:12:21] righteous who judge
[2:12:24] shall give me at that day and not only
[2:12:27] me me only but all to all also who love
[2:12:31] his what appearing that is true looking
[2:12:34] for that blessed hope of a water watches
[2:12:37] appear glorious glorious appearing of
[2:12:42] the wolf great God and who I'll save you
[2:12:46] Jesus Christ who gave himself for us
[2:12:49] that he might redeem us from our
[2:12:51] iniquity and purify unto himself a water
[2:12:54] peculiar people jealous of water good
[2:12:57] work so there is a glorious appearing
[2:12:59] and that appearing is a church
[2:13:05] about that
[2:13:07] glory to God brother Branham interpret
[2:13:10] look
[2:13:12] he says I tell you that he will avenge
[2:13:15] them who's
[2:13:16] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[2:13:20] shall he find water Faith now that is
[2:13:23] the question
[2:13:24] 65. here is where I want to get
[2:13:28] in water revelation 10.
[2:13:36] everybody okay so Revelation 10
[2:13:40] according to brother Branham is the
[2:13:44] fulfilling of Luke 18.
[2:13:48] happy
[2:13:49] to bring the faith
[2:13:52] before they coming
[2:13:56] everybody okay
[2:13:58] he says we shall get into a few minutes
[2:14:02] to another water
[2:14:03] scripture he says in the days of the
[2:14:07] message of the Water Seven Angels the
[2:14:09] mystery of God ought to be water finish
[2:14:11] here is the water question is if you
[2:14:15] follow in that line in which hour this
[2:14:18] hour will it be water finish we laugh
[2:14:21] and water the faith will water Malachi 4
[2:14:24] be what fulfill to restore the faith of
[2:14:28] the water children back to the water
[2:14:31] faith of the fathers the original the
[2:14:34] water the word
[2:14:38] Jesus cannot come without the faith to
[2:14:42] bring him down
[2:14:46] everybody okay everybody okay the Bible
[2:14:50] says and he shall send who Jesus Christ
[2:14:53] which before was preached unto you whom
[2:14:56] the water the Heaven Must water receive
[2:14:59] the heaven are holding him until the
[2:15:03] times of the restitution of what all
[2:15:06] things Elijah must come and restore all
[2:15:10] things
[2:15:15] the book of actors say the heaven are
[2:15:19] blocking Jesus
[2:15:20] even if Jesus wake up and say I'm going
[2:15:23] they haven't said you cannot go
[2:15:27] until there is a faith there
[2:15:30] will restore all things but to restore
[2:15:34] office Elijah must come first
[2:15:39] so Revelation 10 is fulfilling look at
[2:15:44] him to restore the first person of the
[2:15:48] Rapture for you to go in the rapture
[2:15:52] [Applause]
[2:15:54] everybody okay this is where the message
[2:15:57] gets yummy and juicy
[2:16:00] everybody okay he says but God is just
[2:16:04] now water Loosely loosening up the water
[2:16:08] the church where everywhere getting in
[2:16:11] order so he can get into what the
[2:16:13] Rapture God to give it how rapturing
[2:16:16] Faith before he can go in the water
[2:16:23] you don't go to the Rapture with healing
[2:16:26] faith

[2:16:56] who die in here are depending and
[2:16:59] waiting on us so the state has to come

[2:17:32] water perfect is water come then that
[2:17:34] which is what Paul is water done away
[2:17:40] what happened in Revelation 10 it is the
[2:17:43] coming of the Lord

[2:26:38] of time
[2:26:40] a period of time for his ministry
[2:26:45] amen
[2:26:47] but Jesus is saying that the day will
[2:26:50] come
[2:26:51] that you would desire
[2:26:54] this is Jesus as a human being to see
[2:26:58] one

[2:29:15] is flashing
[2:29:17] that's not what the Bible is saying
[2:29:20] that's Pentecostal understanding

[2:29:27] will come on one end
[2:29:31] not all the end

[2:30:23] are you following me
[2:30:25] there is one part and there is another
[2:30:28] part
[2:30:29] and Jesus is saying the lightning will
[2:30:32] come on one part
[2:30:34] okay
[2:30:35] but when it come on one part the effect
[2:30:38] of the lightning will begin to God to
[2:30:42] the other part
[2:30:45] that is the way
[2:30:47] the son of man woke up in that the way
[2:30:51] Jesus will come on one part
[2:30:55] are you following me and he's coming on
[2:30:58] one part the effect of his coming woke
[2:31:02] God to the other part

[2:31:18] are you there amen but first if you if
[2:31:22] you see but it's an opposition
[2:31:25] now it's another coming but first must
[2:31:29] he water suffer that's the first coming
[2:31:31] that's when he came to bleed remember
[2:31:33] many things and be rejected of water
[2:31:36] this generation that's when he was alive
[2:31:39] amen
[2:31:41] and as he was in the days of Hope no so
[2:31:51] let's go slowly 15 miles an hour so shy
[2:31:56] future
[2:31:58] social
[2:32:00] be also in the days plural
[2:32:05] after who son of man so there is a day
[2:32:08] the son of man always have days he have
[2:32:11] a period of time
[2:32:13] are we
[2:32:14] verse 28 there are seven they did it
[2:32:17] they drunk they marry wife
[2:32:20] jump to verse 28.
[2:32:22] let's go to 29 for the sake of time
[2:32:25] but the same day
[2:32:28] no 28. likewise also as he was in the
[2:32:32] days of lot they did eat they drunk they
[2:32:36] bought the salt they planted they built
[2:32:38] normal life
[2:32:39] but the same day

[2:32:45] went water fire and brimstone from water
[2:32:48] Heaven if you notice both example are
[2:32:52] followed by judgment

[2:32:56] Sodom judgment
[2:32:58] the every coming every example is
[2:33:01] followed by a judgment everybody okay

[2:33:08] out of Sodom he ran fire in Brimstone
[2:33:10] from heaven and destroyed them oh watch
[2:33:14] verse 30. even thus shall he be in the
[2:33:18] day one day
[2:33:21] one day
[2:33:23] not the days one day when the son of man
[2:33:27] is what we will stop so the son of man
[2:33:30] will be revealed one day
[2:33:35] relax my friend okay
[2:33:38] jump to verse 30 for you
[2:33:42] I tell you in the night in that night

[2:34:33] divided into parts
[2:34:34] one part versus the other one part is in

[2:37:59] in a message
[2:38:00] brother pranam did you know
[2:38:03] Judas will come from from the water is
[2:38:13] where did Brother Branham get this
[2:38:17] this message
[2:38:20] if you're tired you tell me I can stop
[2:38:22] here
[2:38:23] Jesus will come from the water is where
[2:38:26] did Brother Branham get the scripture
[2:38:29] did he give you the scripture
[2:38:33] there's light to us from the water yes
[2:38:35] everything's civilization started in
[2:38:38] there yes and traffic house until it
[2:38:41] revolves around and catches itself out
[2:38:43] again we are in the water Western
[2:38:46] Hemisphere that is the water West
[2:38:48] Eastern Eastern the Eastern is the
[2:38:51] oldest civilization China is the oldest
[2:38:53] civilization known by the historian in
[2:38:56] the world today how is then after he did
[2:39:00] that then he let them go in the
[2:39:02] slaughter that was the persecution under
[2:39:04] who now you see he is the same Angel
[2:39:09] come forth again coming from the water
[2:39:12] and where Jesus shall come
[2:39:22] brother brother
[2:39:30] when you come in the front from the
[2:39:33] front you know where each Street runs up
[2:39:36] this way you are going right to East
[2:39:38] then then if you shall stand up when I'm
[2:39:41] preaching I'm preaching toward the what
[2:39:43] West
[2:39:46] slow down I told you it's a different
[2:39:47] material
[2:39:48] so when brother brother was building the
[2:39:51] Branham Tabernacle
[2:39:52] he built the Branham Tabernacle as the
[2:39:56] Tabernacle of Moses
[2:40:01] so that when he preaches brother brother
[2:40:04] will be preaching looking West
[2:40:09] I told you it's a different language
[2:40:12] and the congregation will be facing
[2:40:20] everybody okay
[2:40:23] see now I do that so the author will be
[2:40:27] today is so as you coming here
[2:40:30] and you sit here praying brother brother
[2:40:33] made sure that you looking
[2:40:39] because
[2:40:41] Jesus is coming from the East
[2:40:47] the altar we buy always today well
[2:40:51] usually I don't know it's just what I
[2:40:54] always did I send it in the Bible
[2:40:57] usually back there Daniel said he went
[2:41:00] and pulled up the window you know and
[2:41:02] everything like that and pray to that
[2:41:04] and notice the old Mosaic Temple I think
[2:41:08] first how is the order yeah and of
[2:41:12] course God will heal you wherever you
[2:41:13] are
[2:41:14] I don't want you to say that God won't
[2:41:16] heal you when you're looking at enough
[2:41:19] but for some reason I'm putting the
[2:41:21] Tabernacle Facing East
[2:41:25] I know at this time you are holding the
[2:41:28] chair where is he going at
[2:41:32] don't forget that word which word is
[2:41:35] word where is Jesus coming from there is
[2:41:38] in the water Cloud of Glory where does
[2:41:41] the sun rise up when will the sun rise
[2:41:44] where was The Mercy Seat sitting towards
[2:41:48] why have I got you all sitting this way
[2:41:50] toward the east
[2:41:58] everybody okay the first coming he's
[2:42:01] coming the second coming he's coming
[2:42:03] he's the third coming he's coming on
[2:42:06] Sunset Mountain it's which away which
[2:42:09] direction
[2:42:19] did Jesus that came on the east on the
[2:42:22] first coming he will say what amen the
[2:42:25] Jesus that is coming on the second
[2:42:26] coming is what amen the Jesus that is
[2:42:29] coming on the third coming is his help
[2:42:31] but who came on Sunset Mountain on which
[2:42:34] direction
[2:42:41] we Okay we okay
[2:42:47] if I will be facing this which are
[2:42:51] really a traditional that are just to
[2:42:53] face today is because he's coming from
[2:42:56] there when a baptized are usually
[2:42:59] baptized them how their way always to my
[2:43:03] right side because each time that light
[2:43:05] comes he come from the water right side
[2:43:08] and I and so I always try to keep the
[2:43:11] people come coming to me from the water
[2:43:13] and I'll be standing kind of this way I
[2:43:16] suppose positionally the way the
[2:43:18] building is water sit it out there so
[2:43:20] when brother Branham is on the pulpit
[2:43:22] the angel Comes This Way
[2:43:27] have to turn this way and let the people
[2:43:30] come this way
[2:43:34] I'm going to leave the right side
[2:43:37] everybody okay
[2:43:40] my friend but one of this day there is a
[2:43:44] great water magnet coming from the water
[2:43:46] is called The Who Son of God
[2:43:49] sweep this land
[2:43:52] and every person that is dead in Christ
[2:43:55] shallow rise with him so your boss is

[2:44:58] earth now the Messiah will not be on
[2:45:01] earth until the water Millennium sets in

[2:52:57] let me skip this you can get it home
[2:53:01] when the son of man shall appear it
[2:53:04] shall be like the water light that
[2:53:06] sounded from the water is unto the water
[2:53:08] and the whole thing there shall be a
[2:53:10] water a water and we shall water away go
[2:53:17] everybody okay everybody okay
[2:53:20] let me close here
[2:53:22] with what happened on Sunset Mountain on
[2:53:26] the west side can you give me 10 minutes
[2:53:29] okay and then I land the ship
[2:53:32] in the very day that the son of man is
[2:53:35] what revealed Revelation water
[2:53:38] one to seven that's a real feeling
[2:53:42] I'm going slowly now okay read it when
[2:53:47] you get home the seven Angel message
[2:53:49] doing water opening up the sea what is
[2:53:52] it not the angel is the son of man but
[2:53:55] the messenger is revealing the water son
[2:53:58] of man can you get it separately now
[2:54:02] that is where it seems water for you see
[2:54:06] not the man himself but the Water Seven
[2:54:09] Angels the seven messenger is revealing
[2:54:11] to the water the water son of man
[2:54:14] because he left the water
[2:54:19] Lord help me
[2:54:21] everybody okay
[2:54:24] I want you to notice to know this issue
[2:54:27] and you that listen to the table you
[2:54:30] might have a thought today that I was
[2:54:31] trying to say about myself being that I
[2:54:34] was packing this word message I have no
[2:54:36] more to do it than nothing no more than
[2:54:39] just a water voice
[2:54:42] let me skip this this you know
[2:54:45] you can read it at home my brother on
[2:54:48] the computer make sure it's appearing
[2:54:50] okay they can catch up this at home let
[2:54:53] me go to this one
[2:54:55] what happened on Sunset Mountain he
[2:54:57] shook the Earth and when he did I was
[2:55:00] still looking where Westward not East
[2:55:04] because Jesus come from the water yes
[2:55:06] and way of in eternity I saw a
[2:55:10] constellation of something how come so
[2:55:13] this coming is coming on the west
[2:55:16] right not taste we need to separate the
[2:55:20] son of man word and the son of man's
[2:55:23] flesh the son of man flesh always come
[2:55:26] at the East
[2:55:28] but the son of man word will come on the
[2:55:31] west to restore the faith before the
[2:55:35] coming of the East
[2:55:36] [Applause]
[2:55:41] there's West there's the East is the sun
[2:55:45] rise
[2:55:46] the West is there sunset on the sunset
[2:55:51] Mountain on the sunrise East
[2:56:01] [Laughter]
[2:56:03] oh my you can read the rest of home
[2:56:07] the angel walks to my left would be
[2:56:10] really the water last or the seven
[2:56:12] angels if you would cut them from the
[2:56:14] left to the right because he was on my
[2:56:16] left me looking to him toward the what
[2:56:19] West him toward the water East
[2:56:23] so when brother Branham saw the seventh
[2:56:26] angel he was on the west looking
[2:56:30] East and brother Branham looking West
[2:56:35] that's not the man Jesus
[2:56:37] it is the word
[2:56:39] everybody okay West toward me looking
[2:56:43] toward the west him looking toward water
[2:56:45] the East will be on my left
[2:56:47] and so that will be the last Angel
[2:56:49] message very notable and that is the
[2:56:53] seventh seal it is a notable thing
[2:56:57] almost my friend
[2:57:00] this is the scripture they quote the
[2:57:02] people use a lot
[2:57:04] Jesus come on Sunset Mountain let's look
[2:57:06] at the court
[2:57:08] when the seals are what and the Mystery
[2:57:12] is what revealed done come there angel
[2:57:15] did he say come the man
[2:57:18] who's coming Angel the man Jesus Christ
[2:57:23] the Angel The Who messenger who Christ
[2:57:27] setting his foot upon the land and upon
[2:57:29] the sea with a rainbow of a water his
[2:57:32] head now remember this seven Angel is
[2:57:35] all the Earth but the problem at the
[2:57:38] time of this what can mean the coming of
[2:57:40] who the angel
[2:57:43] not the coming of the man Jesus Christ
[2:57:46] Jesus come on the east
[2:57:49] not on the west
[2:57:51] it is the coming of the Angel fulfilling
[2:57:54] Revelation 10 Jesus come on the west yes
[2:57:58] Jesus as the angel
[2:58:01] [Applause]
[2:58:04] any Bible reader knows that that Pillar
[2:58:08] of Fire wants the water Angel of the
[2:58:11] Covenant the elongos that went out of

[3:05:50] picture and he shows the Lord Jesus
[3:05:52] Christ
[3:05:55] naturally
[3:05:57] the picture is what scientific

[3:06:36] the water perfect identification it can
[3:06:39] a water Vindication that this message is
[3:06:42] what you choose
[3:06:43] [Music]
[3:06:45] foreign
[3:06:52] how many days was the son of man
[3:06:54] revealed
[3:07:00] the Revelation Luke 17 30 only happened
[3:07:03] in one one day
[3:07:10] father
[3:07:12] I'm skipping all of that
[3:07:15] any blood that will come from Christ
[3:07:18] will be from the water then his couple
[3:07:21] of bodies here then the water Second
[3:07:24] Coming is over
[3:07:27] and the second cup and the Corporal body
[3:07:29] can go from which direction
[3:07:31] [Music]
[3:07:34] you're going to read the remaining at
[3:07:35] home we believe in the water second
[3:07:39] coming of Christ how the visible
[3:07:43] body of the Lord not the water spirit
[3:07:46] not that one
[3:08:07] live forever
[3:08:10] [Music]
[3:08:11] Hallelujah
[3:08:13] this copper body can do it when that
[3:08:16] comes time is what over
[3:08:19] time is over come here
[3:08:22] you're going to reach the home when a
[3:08:25] man stand and say that he is a minister
[3:08:28] a pastor of the church somewhere and
[3:08:30] does not believe that Jesus Christ is
[3:08:33] the same in water every detail except
[3:08:36] the water physical body he same
[3:08:39] yesterday to them forever that is the
[3:08:41] water the seed of discrepancy whoever
[3:08:45] preaches
[3:08:46] that's what happened in South segmental
[3:08:48] is the coming of a physical Jesus Christ
[3:08:51] that minister in the message is a seed
[3:08:54] of discrepancy
[3:08:59] everybody okay Jesus cannot be here in
[3:09:03] the water because when that body
[3:09:06] returned the time here the time the
[3:09:09] water ends he can be here in the water
[3:09:13] but he is here in the spiritual body in
[3:09:17] the form called the water Holy Spirit
[3:09:23] everybody okay which year is this 64.
[3:09:27] Jesus also who made the promise and as
[3:09:31] we will say this same hope Jesus that
[3:09:33] was water taken out from you will come
[3:09:36] again in like manner as you have seen
[3:09:38] him go to water heaven we are watching
[3:09:41] for that glad day to come
[3:09:45] future
[3:09:49] last one and we finish here
[3:09:52] have lived which year 64 after the seals
[3:09:55] after sunset Mountain I have lived since
[3:09:58] I was a water a little boy my only
[3:10:01] achievement I ever had is to see who
[3:10:04] Jesus Christ is coming in 64. is still
[3:10:08] looking for Jesus I gave my life for
[3:10:11] water that purpose I'm still in the
[3:10:14] Pulpit as an old man I believe the same
[3:10:16] story and that greatest thing I think
[3:10:19] our faith is to see who Jesus Christ
[3:10:22] coming from water heaven to the water
[3:10:25] receive his own
[3:10:27] [Music]
[3:10:32] from his childhood until he died he was
[3:10:36] expecting to see Jesus Christ to come
[3:10:40] and to take the bride
[3:10:43] what happened on Sunset Mountain
[3:10:46] what happened in the Coronado Forest
[3:10:49] it is the coming of the Lord
[3:10:52] scientifically
[3:10:54] science have to prove it
[3:10:56] but that's not the man Jesus Christ
[3:10:59] demand Jesus Christ in his first coming
[3:11:02] he came
[3:11:03] East and he was human in the second
[3:11:06] coming he's coming and he was a human in
[3:11:10] the third coming he's coming yes and he
[3:11:12] will be human what happened in South
[3:11:14] Saint Martin Is Not a Human Being it is
[3:11:17] the word because the son of man when he
[3:11:20] come shall he found Faith there must be
[3:11:23] a word to produce the faith to prepare
[3:11:26] us for the second coming of the Lord
[3:11:29] Jesus Christ let's stand my friend
[3:11:31] [Applause]
[3:11:41] a lot to chew my friend some of you
[3:11:43] already spilled food on the floor
[3:11:50] so go home and clean it
[3:11:52] lets the dog pick it up
[3:12:01] this is to stabilize you
[3:12:04] when Jesus is coming which Jesus come
[3:12:10] for our body to be changed we need to
[3:12:13] see the man a glorified Jesus
[3:12:16] not a glorified angel
[3:12:20] the angel came on the west
[3:12:22] we are expecting somebody to come from
[3:12:24] the East
[3:12:27] everybody okay
[3:12:29] let's pray
[3:12:30] Heavenly Father
[3:12:34] we thank you
[3:12:36] for your grace
[3:12:39] for your love
[3:12:40] and for your mercy
[3:12:44] father
[3:12:46] there is no way
[3:12:49] I as a human being
[3:12:52] can be able to see all of this
[3:12:54] [Music]
[3:12:56] the glory is not to me
[3:12:59] it is you
[3:13:02] that have pity your brother
[3:13:05] and you came
[3:13:07] through the scripture
[3:13:09] and to the message
[3:13:11] to stable us not only your children here
[3:13:15] but I know it's going to go worldwide
[3:13:19] so that the confusion can be left off
[3:13:23] because the hour has come
[3:13:26] when we gotta be prepared
[3:13:30] and now
[3:13:32] through this
[3:13:34] clarity
[3:13:37] foreign we can see the very purpose
[3:13:41] of the message
[3:13:44] it is a message
[3:13:45] that have been sent
[3:13:48] to give us rupturing faith
[3:13:51] a message of a preparation
[3:13:55] a message to give us what we need
[3:13:58] so that we can meet you into the air
[3:14:01] [Music]
[3:14:03] father
[3:14:05] may all our life
[3:14:08] all ambitions
[3:14:10] all our purpose and motive
[3:14:13] never miss
[3:14:15] this
[3:14:17] whether we go to work
[3:14:20] whether we launch into a business
[3:14:23] whether we have project to accomplish
[3:14:26] may we never lose sight
[3:14:29] of this great thing
[3:14:32] that you have put in the hand of the
[3:14:34] believer
[3:14:35] which is the message of the center
[3:14:38] to prepare us
[3:14:40] for the coming of the Lord
[3:14:43] father may we realize
[3:14:46] the importance of this message
[3:14:47] [Music]
[3:14:49] May everything that try to exalt itself
[3:14:52] above what the message say
[3:14:55] may we let it go
[3:14:57] may we put it down
[3:14:59] may we humble ourselves may we stop
[3:15:03] being stubborn
[3:15:04] may we stop wrestling
[3:15:06] with the very thing that is changing us
[3:15:10] that is preparing us that is molding us
[3:15:13] that is shaping us so that we might be
[3:15:17] able like Esther
[3:15:19] to be approved by the kingdom yes
[3:15:22] to find favor be found before the king
[3:15:26] and to be sure
[3:15:28] that that day we will be found clothed
[3:15:32] and not be naked
[3:15:34] and a shame into that presence
[3:15:37] father May the Holy Spirit
[3:15:40] continue to minister to your children
[3:15:43] may you continue to Quicken the word May
[3:15:46] your children go home and study and
[3:15:49] Ponder on this
[3:15:51] and realize that the son of man
[3:15:55] is looking for a fifth
[3:15:57] and we have someone who came to restore
[3:16:00] the faith
[3:16:02] to bring the heart back to the origin of
[3:16:05] faith and that's the faith you are
[3:16:08] looking at because you are the author
[3:16:10] and you are the finisher of that Faith

[3:16:17] you for the time thank you for the
[3:16:19] Revelation thank you for the unfolding
