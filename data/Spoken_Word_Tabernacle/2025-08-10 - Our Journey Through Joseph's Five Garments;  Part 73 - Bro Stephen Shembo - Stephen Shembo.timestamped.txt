[10:18] We thank you, Lord, that we can enter
[10:19] into the garden, Lord.
[10:22] That we can hear your voice this
[10:24] morning, Lord God.
[10:27] That you're faithful, Lord.
[10:30] You're so good to us, Lord, as the song
[10:32] expresses, Lord.
[10:35] How we long to hear your voice, Lord
[10:38] God.
[10:39] Not just when we gather together, Lord,
[10:41] but every minute of every day, Lord.
[10:45] You're such a mighty, wonderful God,
[10:47] Lord. How could anybody who has
[10:50] experienced your love forsake you, Lord,
[10:53] and just turn your back?
[10:55] So, we ask, Lord God, this morning
[10:58] that you would come in our midst, Lord.
[11:00] We believe you're here already, Lord. He
[11:03] is here, Jesus Christ.
[11:07] And we want to worship you this morning,
[11:08] Lord. We want to praise you this
[11:10] morning, Lord God, for the things that
[11:12] you're doing each and every day, Lord.

[11:17] here today, Lord, you just come, Lord,
[11:19] and just wipe it away, Lord, and take
[11:21] care of it, Lord, and let us sing, Lord,

[11:31] God.
[11:33] Bless the singers, Lord God. Bless our
[11:36] congregation, Lord, as we join in unity
[11:38] and lift our voices to heaven this
[11:40] morning, Lord God. We thank you, Father,
[11:43] for everything that you say to us, Lord.
[11:46] Your voice comes through many people,
[11:48] Lord, but it's all speaking one thing to
[11:50] us, Lord, and that's what you gave the
[11:51] prophet, Lord,
[11:54] the voice of the last day. And we thank
[11:56] you, Lord. Bless our pastor, Lord, as he
[12:00] is preparing, Lord, this morning, Lord,

[12:08] issues just go away this morning and
[12:10] correct themselves. We thank you,
[12:11] Father.
[12:13] Lord, we just want to sing. We just want
[12:15] to worship, Lord. We just want to praise
[12:17] your name, Lord. We just want to give
[12:18] you all the glory in our lives, Lord
[12:20] God.
[12:22] Sometimes we can't even express
[12:23] ourselves, Lord, because there's just
[12:25] not words that we can find for the
[12:28] goodness, Lord, and the faithfulness
[12:30] that you've shown us in our lives, Lord.
[12:34] Come one more time, Lord God, and sit
[12:36] beside us on the pew this morning, Lord,
[12:38] and break forth your bread, Lord. Give
[12:40] us this day, Lord, our daily portion of
[12:43] bread. Lord, we thank you, Lord. We give
[12:47] everything back to you, Lord, in Jesus
[12:49] Christ's name. Help us, Lord. Help us if
[12:51] we're not where we need to be with you,
[12:53] Lord God. Be diligent, please, Lord God,
[12:55] and to finish that which you started in
[12:58] us, Lord Jesus. And we'll do our best,
[13:00] Lord, to be diligent to serve you, Lord
[13:02] God, and to worship and sing. We thank
[13:05] you, Father. We give every portion of
[13:07] this service back to you in the name of

[46:03] wonderful worship this morning.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; Praise and worship. It's your season
[46:09] &gt;&gt; to be blessed.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; Who came up with that inspiration?
[46:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Who came up with the
[46:20] song and the inspiration? My God, what a
[46:22] surprise.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; Huh? Now I don't even know which
[46:26] direction to go because now you came up
[46:28] with another sermon. It's your season to
[46:31] be blessed.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; We apologize when you will see this u
[46:39] the sermon later on for some reason
[46:43] which I know it's the devil.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; The internet is not working in the
[46:48] church.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; There is no outage in the area. For some
[46:51] reason it stopped yesterday. So they
[46:53] will call a technician but we got our
[46:56] backup.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; We are recording everything. Everything
[46:59] is under recording and no problem at
[47:01] all. But for the invisible audience when
[47:04] you see when it's loaded on YouTube, we
[47:07] greet you all in the precious name of
[47:10] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ both
[47:13] visible and invisible audience. So our
[47:16] apology invisible audience, it's not my
[47:18] fault. You blame the devil. So you pray
[47:22] and then uh pray for the church. It's an
[47:24] issue with the internet, but we got to
[47:26] back up. Everything has been recorded
[47:28] and Lord's willing, we will upload that
[47:30] on YouTube at the appropriate time.
[47:33] Amen.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; So you pray with us and thank God we
[47:35] have another alternative for another
[47:37] Verizon uh internet. So that's the one
[47:41] we're using to record everything. So all
[47:43] is well by God's grace and sometime it
[47:46] pays to be in church.
[47:54] Amen.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Any families member here,
[48:00] God richly bless you. Brother Lusenov, I
[48:03] see you there with your wife, God bless
[48:06] you. You just stand and whoever first
[48:08] time, second time, just stand so we can
[48:11] welcome you.
[48:13] Praise God. Long time no see. God bless
[48:16] you and welcome to Spoken Word. You may
[48:19] be seated. You home. You're not a
[48:21] visitor. You a family member. Amen. So
[48:23] if you want to say amen, you say amen.
[48:25] You want to shout, you shout. Just be
[48:27] free. This is another home for you.
[48:29] Amen. And good to see you. God richly
[48:32] bless you and we trust the family and
[48:33] everybody is doing well.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Sister Sharon, you can check
[48:38] sister if she calls you by God's grace.
[48:41] And then uh I have uh I'm going to go
[48:44] through my announcement quickly. I
[48:46] believe we are up to date with the
[48:47] sermon. We're reading our Bible twice a
[48:50] day, our cood book, church ages. And I'm
[48:53] happy the younger one are picking up on
[48:55] church ages. I'm so happy because you
[48:57] will learn stuff by yourself. It seems
[48:59] like the spirit of the Lord is moving
[49:01] with the young and I'm so happy about
[49:03] it. So we reading our church ages, our
[49:05] 70 weeks, the seals adoption or somebody
[49:09] is listening to the message of the hour.
[49:11] I went to sleep with brother Brandon
[49:13] playing.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; Uh so if you don't do it, that's your
[49:18] problem. You know the message is free.
[49:20] It's online. Just hit the button and
[49:22] you'll be fine. I remember when I had a
[49:24] flip phone, I was praying God. I say the
[49:26] day I'm going to have a phone when I
[49:28] would just click because at the
[49:30] beginning years ago, you have to
[49:32] download the message and to play it and
[49:34] then your phone before you know it is
[49:36] full. So I was praying. I said, Lord,
[49:38] when I would get a night phone, when I
[49:40] would just hit it and brother and
[49:41] finally everybody have it. But how many
[49:44] time do we listen to the message? Now
[49:46] it's another problem. Amen. So
[49:48] everything is in your hand. Make sure
[49:50] you take advantage before they tell you
[49:53] that your internet is off.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; And then you will realize what you've
[49:58] been missing all along.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. You might have your alarm and
[50:03] everything at home once the internet is
[50:04] off. That's it.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; You can't even view your camera.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the always is always better.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; Question and answer. I'm still waiting
[50:16] on Bronn Glenn to let me know. We're
[50:18] working with the facility to let me know
[50:20] when is the next session and once the
[50:22] deacon finalized I will give you the
[50:24] date. And the young man meeting was
[50:27] wonderful yesterday. I put the summary
[50:30] there. So parent you will see what I
[50:32] spoke with the children and if you have
[50:34] a question you can pull them aside and
[50:36] ask them what did you learn today and
[50:38] they should be able to tell you. Amen.
[50:41] But it was a tremendous blessing. We
[50:43] went there. I don't know how many hours
[50:44] was it,
[50:45] &gt;&gt; but what three hours and they still
[50:48] don't want me to stop.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; I say, "Can we stop?" And they said,
[50:52] "No." I was like, "Oh my god." So now
[50:54] it's hitting home. They know the three
[50:57] category of women.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; It's on a group chat. They know three
[51:03] category of women
[51:05] &gt;&gt; and who to court.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because usually when you tell
[51:10] youth we have a youth meeting and then
[51:12] the first thing I mean it's about
[51:13] courtship everybody's waiting okay what
[51:15] is the first step what is the second I
[51:17] said no no no no no no you are patriarch
[51:20] and I understood why brother Brandham
[51:22] say he had a meeting with the boys
[51:24] separate and then with the girls
[51:26] separate. I don't mind having a meeting
[51:29] together with boys and girls but brother
[51:31] Brham did it separately. You need to
[51:33] stay under the headship
[51:35] &gt;&gt; of brother Brham. Regardless of what you
[51:37] think, brother Brham will be always
[51:40] right.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I notice with my own
[51:43] experience when I'm talking to the boys,
[51:45] it's a different anointing.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; And I see things differently because
[51:49] whatever they learn yesterday, none of
[51:51] the girl have any idea of what they
[51:53] learned yesterday. It's like a different
[51:56] channel. And brother Tony said, "Brother
[51:58] Stephen, if any of them got a wrong
[52:00] woman, it's their own fault."
[52:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:04] In other words, everything was planned.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Brother Angel is right here. You you saw
[52:09] him. Ah, so he's telling you everything
[52:12] was planned.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Three category of women.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; Three of them.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; So parent, let's stay with the with the
[52:19] correct category.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; Don't come to me and try to negotiate
[52:24] something that is not in the word. I am
[52:26] not going to buy it. I'm not going to be
[52:28] part of it. You're going to do it
[52:30] yourself and brother Stephen won't be
[52:32] there.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; And don't put pressure on me.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; And don't put pressure in the church.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; And don't come and say, "Well, so we put
[52:40] a standard." The standard is the word of
[52:43] God.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; And and yesterday they they they even
[52:48] learn why God say he hated Esau.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; That's right. Wow.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible say before Esau was
[52:55] born, the scripture say, "I love Jacob
[52:59] and I hated Esau." And usually there is
[53:01] one thing we know about Esau is just
[53:04] because he despised the birthight.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; But yesterday they they saw more than
[53:09] the birthight.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Esau was a troublemaker.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; And his trouble was with women.
[53:20] Amen.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; Ask the young men, they will give you
[53:23] the scripture.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Every wife that Esau got was a trouble.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; And the Bible say those women cause
[53:30] trouble to the parent.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; You don't marry a woman that will be a
[53:35] trouble to the family.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen my friend?
[53:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; You don't bring a woman in the family
[53:44] and she begin to cause trouble. The
[53:46] Bible say
[53:49] [Applause]
[53:52] &gt;&gt; the Bible even say that Rebecca
[53:56] &gt;&gt; told Isaac
[53:57] &gt;&gt; that I cannot leave anymore. I don't
[54:00] even want to leave anymore because of
[54:02] the wife of Esau.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; It's written in the Bible.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Because there were three type of women.
[54:12] There is a woman from the lineage of
[54:14] Abraham
[54:15] &gt;&gt; and there was a woman from the lineage
[54:17] of Ishmael.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Look at your group chart. And there was
[54:22] a woman from the Canaanite
[54:25] &gt;&gt; and Esau married the Canaanite women
[54:28] &gt;&gt; and the Bible said they caused trouble
[54:30] to the parent
[54:32] &gt;&gt; until Rebecca say I don't want to leave
[54:35] because of this. Amen.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; And Rebecca told Isaac, he said, "A
[54:40] Isaac, if Jacob ever marry a woman from
[54:45] the Canaanite, I'm doomed."
[54:47] &gt;&gt; I'm going to the tomb. I'm finished.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; So, Abraham called uh I mean uh Isaac
[54:57] called Jacob and he said, "Jacob, I
[54:59] don't want you to get married among the
[55:01] Canaanites. Yes,
[55:02] &gt;&gt; I want you to go back
[55:05] &gt;&gt; to my country.
[55:07] [Music]
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; The country where Rebecca came from.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; That's where Rachel was.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; He said, "You go back to the country
[55:17] &gt;&gt; and then go over there and go find a
[55:19] woman." Amen. And Rebecca was picked at
[55:22] the well.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[55:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; And Jacob met Rachel at the well.
[55:33] And when Rebecca was picked, she was not
[55:36] even prepared for the banquet.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; She was working.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; She went to pick up the stuff for work.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Didn't know it was her marriage.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; When Rachel met Jacob, she was working.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; She was bringing the sheep of her
[55:54] father. Amen.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; When the young man came from Chicago,
[55:58] &gt;&gt; when he came down, he met his wife on
[56:01] the backyard working.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[56:06] [Applause]
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; In other words, they picked those women
[56:13] when they were natural.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; Natural.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Great.
[56:20] As a young man, you go into a youth
[56:23] meeting, all of them are dressed for the
[56:25] impression.
[56:27] [Applause]
[56:29] &gt;&gt; They are dressed to impress you.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; You need to be careful how you picking
[56:34] up.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[56:37] [Applause]
[56:39] &gt;&gt; There are certain language I talk to
[56:42] them. I'm on YouTube. I won't tell you
[56:45] because I talk to men. The deacon knows.
[56:48] There are certain stuff I show them.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; I say because some of you are naive.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; You were not accustomed to women.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; So I need to open up your mind.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; So you know how to deal with a sister
[57:03] and decode what is going on.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[57:07] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; You wasting your time. That's your
[57:14] problem. Amen. I say the woman you going
[57:17] to pick up over there,
[57:18] &gt;&gt; you don't really know where her hair is.
[57:22] [Applause]
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[57:34] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[57:35] &gt;&gt; I have my wife, younger sister. Before
[57:37] she got married, the young man came, she
[57:40] stopped. She say, "Hey, before we
[57:42] continue further, she did this.
[57:47] She said, "Look at me."
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; This is the way I am.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; And she ended up getting married.
[57:56] [Applause]
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[58:05] &gt;&gt; I say young man, you going there. Oh,
[58:07] youth gathering. Youth gathering. Oh,
[58:09] no.
[58:14] Are we together?
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Go to her home.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; Go to the house.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; And you're going to see the real deal.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to block myself.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. They know what I told them.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; They know what I told them. I told them
[58:33] more than what I'm saying here. If you
[58:35] can read between the line, you can see
[58:37] how deep I went with them.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. I say because you're going to make
[58:41] one choice
[58:43] &gt;&gt; and you don't come out.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; I say if you complain, I talk to you.
[58:47] I'll advise you and take you back to
[58:49] your home and sh you back in and lock
[58:52] the door. I say you continue over there
[58:54] until the coming of the Lord.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; I say brother, you will hate your home.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; The home have nothing to do with it.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; The bed is not a problem. Your couch
[59:08] have nothing. It is the woman that is
[59:10] living inside.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; I say but if you find a good one,
[59:17] &gt;&gt; the one the Lord gave you, then you a
[59:19] happy man the rest of your life.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; And you will say marriage is a good
[59:24] thing because the Bible say whoever
[59:26] found a good a woman has found a good
[59:30] thing and found favor from the Lord.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; In other words, the one choosing the
[59:35] woman is not you.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[59:38] [Applause]
[59:38] [Music]
[59:43] Some of you are lost.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; You see how you going? When I will begin
[59:50] to preach, you will start looking at
[59:52] that way.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Whoever findeth a woman
[59:57] &gt;&gt; foundeth a good thing,"
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; and we know what good means.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Huh? Whoever findeth a woman findeth
[1:00:08] what?
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; A good thing.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; He has found favor with the Lord.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; So in other words, to find a good woman,
[1:00:19] you must find favor with the Lord.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; So actually, who is picking up the
[1:00:23] woman?
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:00:27] [Applause]
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Who picked up Eve?
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Who brought Eve?
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Who manufactured Eve? God
[1:00:37] [Applause]
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; preach.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; I gave them another quote, another
[1:00:44] scripture the Bible because it looks
[1:00:46] like you loving this.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; And I told them yesterday, I say if I
[1:00:49] give this to married couple, you will
[1:00:52] see how they saying amen. What did I
[1:00:53] tell you yesterday? Did you hear amen?
[1:00:58] The Bible says house
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; and riches
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; you will inherit them from your father.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; It's written in the Bible.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; But a woman
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; is inherited from the Lord.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; I have the quote, my friend.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; In other and and when when the scripture
[1:01:20] say inheritance,
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; it means it didn't belong to you.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:01:26] It was for somebody.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; So your wife was for God.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; It was the property of God.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; And God inherits you.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; So when you getting married, you're
[1:01:38] getting an inheritance of a daughter of
[1:01:40] God.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together? It's a gift.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a gift from God.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; Brother Joshua was on fire.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Enoch was on fire.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Angelo was there like this.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; And when Esau heard it
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; that Abraham is h Isaac is talking to
[1:02:17] Jacob.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Go marry over there.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Yes. If you notice, Esau was revealed
[1:02:23] the source
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; of where the correct women are coming
[1:02:27] from.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says to please his father,
[1:02:31] he went and got another wife from the
[1:02:34] daughter of Ishmael.
[1:02:37] Even though the source was disclosed to
[1:02:40] him
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; because he's of the seed of Cain,
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; even when they show them the revelation
[1:02:47] like do like your brother, still there
[1:02:49] is nothing in them to do it.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; And if you notice the second time Issach
[1:02:55] got married, he went to pick up a
[1:02:56] daughter from Ishmael.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; And Ishmael is from the seed of Abraham.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; But it's a cast away woman.
[1:03:07] In other words, when he bring that one,
[1:03:09] he say, "What else do you want?" Ismael
[1:03:12] was a son of Abraham.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; You are exaggerating.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; She's in the message, too.
[1:03:19] [Applause]
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:03:27] Are we together?
[1:03:30] Are we together?
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Do you know the origin of Ishmael?
[1:03:34] Ishmael came from a combination of
[1:03:37] Abraham
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; and Hagar which was an Egyptian who was
[1:03:42] an Egyptian.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; So it's Abraham with Egypt.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; It's the word and the world
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; that are combined together.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; I say if so went to pick up a woman in
[1:03:54] the message but that is worldly.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:59] to try to please the parent
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; that at least she's in the message.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; I say, "But watch her in the message."
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; I told them all.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; I say, "Young man, if you see a sister
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; that is very close to the world,
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; I say psychologically
[1:04:22] take earring."
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; I talked to them yesterday. I say take
[1:04:27] earring and put on that sister in your
[1:04:30] mind.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; If you put earring in your mind, you
[1:04:33] will see that she now
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; looks exactly like the world. In other
[1:04:38] words, the only difference
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; that you know she's a sister is because
[1:04:43] she does an earring.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; But if you look at her, her clothing are
[1:04:47] tight.
[1:04:49] [Applause]
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; She have high heel like this.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you. My God,
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; I'm going to stop. I told them more than
[1:04:59] that.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; If you notice the way she is, that's a
[1:05:04] daughter of Ishmael.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; You stay away from her.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; Even though she's in the message, but
[1:05:11] she's flooding with the world.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; She doesn't listen to her father.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. She doesn't listen to her mother.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; No, sir. She doesn't listen to the
[1:05:24] pastor.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; She doesn't listen to deacon.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Even at work, she doesn't obey her
[1:05:30] supervisor. Sir,
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; is she going to listen to you?
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:05:40] [Applause]
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; The Bible say
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Jacob obey his father and his mother. I
[1:05:48] read to them yesterday. I say young man,
[1:05:51] you have a godly mother, a godly parent.
[1:05:53] Obey them.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; And when he went, he picked up Rachel.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; And from there came Joseph and Benjamin.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Perfection and the 144,000
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; because he was from the correct lineage.
[1:06:08] [Applause]
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; So that's where we stop. I say, who do
[1:06:12] you court?
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; I say you have your own answer. And when
[1:06:17] you bring me a woman, I say Esau,
[1:06:21] his choice was a Canaanite. And I pulled
[1:06:24] the quote. Brother Brandham say the
[1:06:27] woman that a man marries
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; reflect his ambition.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; I gave them the quote.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham say he also reflect
[1:06:40] what is down deep in that man.
[1:06:44] No matter how much and brother Brandham
[1:06:45] said no matter how much a man is saying
[1:06:47] from his mouth. Brother Brham say watch
[1:06:50] who she marries. I gave them the code.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; If Esau marry a Canaanite
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; who was from the lineage of Satan what
[1:06:59] was done in Esau.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; That's why God hated Esau.
[1:07:06] [Applause]
[1:07:08] Yes sir.
[1:07:09] And I told them, I say, "Young man,
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; when you see a sister and she prick your
[1:07:15] heart,
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; push the brake.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Watch that sister.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; If she's worldly, it means you need
[1:07:22] deliverance."
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; There is something in you that is bad
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; that is thirsting after bad women.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; There is something in you that is
[1:07:31] testing after hypocrite women.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; You need to get that thing clean up. Yes
[1:07:38] sir.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Before you even brother say before you
[1:07:41] make a choice
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; of a woman you need to plan. I gave them
[1:07:45] the quote yesterday.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; I have I have everything on the court.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; I gave it to them
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; parent. I gave you a summary
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; of what I spoke to the young men.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Church. I gave you a summary of what I
[1:08:00] spoke to the young men.
[1:08:01] I told them, I said, "From today,
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; I'm waiting for you to present to me who
[1:08:07] you have in mind."
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; And the day you presented to me, I will
[1:08:15] know who you are.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Once I look at the sister, I say, "My
[1:08:22] boy is still struggling." Amen.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; I told them I said the women at your
[1:08:30] school are not they those are
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Canaanite.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; The woman in college canite.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; I say in the message you be careful
[1:08:40] because we got each manites.
[1:08:46] [Applause]
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; I told them I said watch their fingers.
[1:08:52] You will see their finger on
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; if they start painting in a certain way.
[1:08:58] I say my boy back up a little bit.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Say amen.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; There are certain things I tell them to
[1:09:13] watch.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Some of them are the secret between me
[1:09:20] and the boys. Uh you see because they
[1:09:23] say the if the pastor tell tell he tell
[1:09:26] it all. So let me keep the secret
[1:09:28] between the daddy and the boys.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Because Paul say in the
[1:09:38] marriage there is trouble in the flesh.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; I say so young man by default
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; you have a percentage of trouble.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; In the marriage that won't be taken out.
[1:09:50] I say so when you are negotiating with a
[1:09:52] woman
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; you need to now you and I pick up I say
[1:09:56] you have already 20% by default
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; sir
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; because you still in the flesh
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; that sometime your wife may get upset or
[1:10:04] something you need to negotiate with
[1:10:05] that
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; I say so when you're looking for a woman
[1:10:09] you are not dealing with 80% of peace or
[1:10:12] war
[1:10:19] [Applause]
[1:10:22] Some of you are now losing the GPS.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; I say, but if you find a daughter of God
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; who has been clean by the Holy Ghost,
[1:10:35] [Music]
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; then you know that you're receiving 80%
[1:10:41] of peace
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; and the 20% the Holy Ghost will help you
[1:10:45] manage it.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:48] Amen.
[1:10:49] [Applause]
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; I know question are firing in your mind.
[1:11:01] I gave them a scripture. Paul say I
[1:11:04] would that all of you remain single. I
[1:11:07] gave it to them.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; I say why is the apostle saying you need
[1:11:12] to remain single? I say but God in the
[1:11:15] in Genesis say it is not good for men to
[1:11:18] be alone. Put them together. You ask
[1:11:20] them the question.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; The answer.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Marriage is a good thing.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; It's reflecting God
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; but it need to be done correctly.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; I say young man I'm calling you
[1:11:33] patriarch because the bloodline travel
[1:11:36] through men.
[1:11:40] Amen.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; I say your sister will go to another
[1:11:43] bloodline
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; but the bloodline goes to the male.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; So you as a male in the family you need
[1:11:49] to be careful.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham say the woman I
[1:11:54] gave them the code. Brother Brandham say
[1:11:55] the woman that you choose
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; for to marry
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; the way she is is the way she will make
[1:12:04] her children.
[1:12:10] Amen.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; My friend, this is code.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; I'm giving you quote. You quiet.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Great.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; My friend, did I read to you the quote?
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Did I give you the reference?
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham said,
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; if you marry a woman,
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say, watch the way she
[1:12:33] is.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Watch the way she is. That's the way she
[1:12:36] will make your children grow.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; I have more than this. I I spoke three
[1:12:46] hours with them. Brother Brandham say
[1:12:48] the woman that you choose tells you how
[1:12:51] you are thinking about your future, your
[1:12:54] children.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; Your children. I say young man, you love
[1:12:57] your mother.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; But you must love your wife more than
[1:13:01] that.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; I say so now how I I say
[1:13:04] [Music]
[1:13:06] Brother say the woman you marry is
[1:13:10] exactly reflecting you.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; I say young man when you look at a
[1:13:13] sister that prick your heart
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; push the brake
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; push the brake.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Does she look like you?
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Can you see yourself in that woman?
[1:13:24] If you don't see yourself move
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; married couple meeting will be on
[1:13:38] September.
[1:13:40] [Laughter]
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; I'm saying this because parent doesn't
[1:13:48] have time to be with me there.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; I'm dealing with young men. Yes.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; So I'm giving you an idea what we went
[1:13:54] through.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; So none of the young men can bring me
[1:13:57] something contrary to what they got
[1:13:59] presented.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; You will find another pastor to marry
[1:14:02] you.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; A Canaanite I won't lay hand on you.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Anite I know you going to be doomed for
[1:14:10] trouble.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Bring me a daughter of God.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; And the family will be happy. I say a
[1:14:21] woman when she enter the family,
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; she's blending.
[1:14:25] [Music]
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; I said that's what we want.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; Because God told Israel, when you go to
[1:14:39] Canaan, do not marry those women.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; Amen, brother.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; For a reason.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I gave them the last quote for
[1:14:49] the day. Brother Brham say you marry
[1:14:53] someone that believe exactly like you.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Not like you. Exactly like you.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; That's why we need to be careful in the
[1:15:08] message.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; So next young man meetings find the date
[1:15:14] and let's move on my friend.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; That will be code sheep part two. I'm
[1:15:19] taking my time digging the foundation
[1:15:21] sir
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; before I begin to erect the wall. I have
[1:15:24] quote where brotherham shows the
[1:15:26] specification of a woman to marry. I
[1:15:29] have quote brother say she must be this
[1:15:30] this this this. I'm going to give it to
[1:15:32] them.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Because Paul say you enter don't come
[1:15:40] out. Amen.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; It's a it's a scripture and Paul say
[1:15:43] when you come out don't go
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; and when you are still outside Paul say
[1:15:49] stay outside
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; but we burning
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Paul say then go back and marry you
[1:15:59] didn't sin but just know
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; some of you are having a hard time
[1:16:08] understanding me when Adam was alone.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Alone.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Was he tempted?
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; I'm asking you the Bible. Was he
[1:16:18] tempted?
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Did you see the devil playing with Adam?
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; When they created Eve,
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; did you see the devil coming?
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; But when God made a ceremony
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; and unite Adam and Eve,
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; the devil woke up.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; The beast that was in the garden. now
[1:16:40] rose up
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; because the devil hate marriage.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; The devil hate marriage. I say the wrong
[1:16:51] thing we do in the gospel is we tell you
[1:16:53] come to the gospel and all your trouble
[1:16:55] are finished.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say don't do that.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; I say that's why I'm telling you all
[1:17:01] young men
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; if I tell you come to your marriage and
[1:17:04] all your trouble is finished. No, you
[1:17:05] are entering war zone.
[1:17:08] I say as an advice from your pastor,
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; prepare for the worst,
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; but expect the best.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me well. Prepare for the
[1:17:21] worst,
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; but expect what?
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; The best.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; In other words, until when you enter,
[1:17:29] you have so much ammunition and you say,
[1:17:32] "Ah, brother Steph, you loaded me too
[1:17:34] much. This is a piece of cakeless.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; That's where I want you.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Rather than you entering and you taking
[1:17:42] in ambush
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; like I never thought I'm going into
[1:17:45] something like this.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Uh now you dealing with it. Some of the
[1:17:49] stuff I leave between me and the boys
[1:17:51] and uh they won't tell you mama no
[1:17:54] matter how you push.
[1:17:55] [Laughter]
[1:17:57] They know why they won't tell you. They
[1:17:59] know exactly what I tell you. Unless you
[1:18:01] push really hard. Amen. They can tell
[1:18:03] daddy, but they won't tell you because
[1:18:04] they're boys. Amen.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:10] So, Lord willing, our married couple
[1:18:13] meeting will be on September the 20th,
[1:18:15] part seven and December 13th, it will be
[1:18:18] part 8. Then the young sisters meeting

[1:18:23] question and answer. The building
[1:18:25] project, you see the everything how it's
[1:18:27] moving. Just keep praying, keep doing
[1:18:29] what you want to do. By God's grace,
[1:18:31] according to the leadership of the Holy
[1:18:33] Spirit, but just be careful on the field
[1:18:34] there. Just the children, avoid going
[1:18:37] there. We don't want anybody to get hurt
[1:18:39] or get the mud and uh get the mud inside
[1:18:42] the car. Then mommy will be
[1:18:46] uh the one who washes the car
[1:18:50] to be in a safe side. The daddy won't be
[1:18:52] happy with you carrying the mud over
[1:18:54] there. So you can look over it, no
[1:18:55] problem, but just know stay away because
[1:18:57] of the material that are there. Amen.

[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; And I told them, avoid
[1:20:33] messing around with women.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Because you're texting a sister, you're
[1:20:38] texting a sister, you're texting a

[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Let's pray. Heavenly
[1:22:17] Father, Lord, we approaching you humbly
[1:22:19] this morning. Father, we thank you for
[1:22:21] your grace, your love, your mercy, and
[1:22:23] for everything you have been doing for
[1:22:25] us. Father, thank you for such a
[1:22:27] wonderful group of young men that you
[1:22:30] have given to us. Sometime we don't say
[1:22:32] these things and probably the m thing
[1:22:35] maybe we never been appreciated by our
[1:22:37] pastor. That's why I'm taking my time on
[1:22:40] the pulpit Lord Father all over the
[1:22:42] world declaring how wonderful and
[1:22:44] precious they are to us Lord Father to
[1:22:47] make their way up and coming brother
[1:22:49] Devin coming from work all the way
[1:22:51] coming there to be there to listen to
[1:22:53] the word of the truth. Father we thank
[1:22:55] you and we are committing them unto the
[1:22:57] hand. Father, this is as far as I can go
[1:23:00] with the ability you have given me. But
[1:23:02] when he comes, Lord, Father, to
[1:23:04] ministering to your children, he only
[1:23:06] take the supernatural action of the Holy
[1:23:09] Spirit. Therefore, I ask Lord that you
[1:23:11] move me completely out of the way. May
[1:23:14] you come down in the power of
[1:23:15] resurrection. May you speak to our soul
[1:23:17] and bless us. May the devil and his army
[1:23:20] be completely sealed out. May only the
[1:23:23] Holy Spirit, Lord, Father, and the elect
[1:23:25] angel of God stays in this building to
[1:23:28] minister to us in the name of Jesus
[1:23:30] Christ. Amen.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the book of Deuteronomy,

[1:24:27] It's your season to be blessed.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; If you missed that in the song, that's
[1:24:33] your problem. You're missing a great
[1:24:35] blessing.

[1:24:49] make you jump from here to there. I
[1:24:51] usually go one, two, three. So everybody

[1:25:13] yourself together that I may tell you
[1:25:17] that which shall befall you in the last
[1:25:21] days." This is Jacob calling his
[1:25:23] children to bless them. Everybody clear?
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; You might be seated as we're preparing

[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; You just go, "He's the child of Jacob."
[1:26:06] That's it.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Verse 14. Hallelujah.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; I'm reading the Bible. Then you turn
[1:26:12] your clock on for 45 minutes according

[1:29:31] look over here, it's a sheepfold.
[1:29:34] You look on the other side, it's a
[1:29:36] sheepfold right there.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; So Issachar is a tribe that will be
[1:29:42] blessed
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; by a pastorialum,
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; a livestock.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together? I'm going this slowly
[1:29:52] because this is deep. We clear my
[1:29:54] friend.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; So it's a tribe that is blessed with
[1:29:59] livestock
[1:30:02] with uh sheep whatever cattle whatever
[1:30:07] you call them. So when you see where
[1:30:08] Issacha is laying, this is prophecy that
[1:30:11] is putting these children in the
[1:30:12] promised land.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Remember they are in Egypt
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; and they are giving them prophecy to
[1:30:17] happen over there in the promised land.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; And then when Jacob as a prophet is
[1:30:23] climbing a prophetic realm
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; he look at Issachar he say hey the
[1:30:28] position of Issachar first of all he's
[1:30:31] strong
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; like a n number one. Number two,
[1:30:34] assuming his position, he's laying in
[1:30:37] the promised land where there is a lot
[1:30:40] of livestock.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; The livestock on the right side and the
[1:30:46] livestock on the left side. And Issaka
[1:30:48] is laying there.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; So this tribe is in a prosperous area.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; Correct.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Are we together
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; in the promised land?
[1:30:59] Uh verse uh 15. And he saw that rest was
[1:31:04] what
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; good.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; So Isaka have a rest
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; and he have a good rest.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; In other words, his place is pacific.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; It's peaceful.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; Isakar has a good rest.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; You can take it spiritually
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; or you can take it peacefully.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; A pacific place. That's where Issachar
[1:31:32] lays. Today you're gonna learn Issachar.
[1:31:34] Amen.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; The Bible say, "And he saw that rest was
[1:31:39] good and that and the land that he was
[1:31:43] how
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; pleasant."
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; So the land that Issacha will occupy in
[1:31:47] the promised land will be a good land.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; I hope you are understanding me.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; Land was how
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; pleasant. And remember land and
[1:31:59] livestock goes together.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?

[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; So if you go where is in the promised
[1:32:13] land, it's a fertile place.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; All of this because of the opening of
[1:32:22] the seals.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; You are now reading the scripture. You

[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; where there is livestock
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; rich in agriculture. Are we together?
[1:32:43] And a peaceful place. That is where you
[1:32:46] find Issachar.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; What a blessing from the Lord.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Are we together in the back?
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Ah thank you. And the Bible says that
[1:32:56] and he saw that rest was good and the
[1:32:59] land that he was pleasant and bow his
[1:33:02] shoulder to do what?
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; So Isaka is willing to work.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; He's bowing his shoulder to do what?
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; In other words, to carry.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; There is a willingness in Isachar.
[1:33:23] a will to work.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; You don't force Isakar.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Why is Isaka working? Because he's full
[1:33:34] of agriculture,
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; full of livestock,
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; he have no problem to bow down and to
[1:33:45] work. Are we together?
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; He's willing to do that.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; We clear? If you got agriculture, you
[1:33:53] need a place. You need a means of
[1:33:55] transport to move it.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; So Isaka have no problem. You put
[1:34:00] agriculture, he carried it and carried
[1:34:02] it where you want him to go.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; He's a tribe that can work without any
[1:34:06] problem. He's a working tribe.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; If you're still in courtship, please
[1:34:15] leave courtship. Let's come here
[1:34:20] because some of you when they stuck
[1:34:22] something pain it's like you numb
[1:34:26] leave that alone. Come back here. Amen.
[1:34:28] Let's talk about Isak car. Amen.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; Don't say but Stephen was talking about
[1:34:32] me. No, I was not talking about you. I
[1:34:35] was talking about courtship.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he saw that rest was good and
[1:34:44] the land that he was pleasant and bow
[1:34:46] his shoulder to bear kama and became a
[1:34:50] servant to what to tribute.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; It is good that the land of Issachar is
[1:34:57] a land blessed by livestock. Follow me
[1:35:00] my friend. It's good that it's a
[1:35:02] peaceful land. It is a land that is
[1:35:05] fertile. Issaka is willing to work. But
[1:35:09] there is a danger
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; with Issachar
[1:35:15] and the danger is Issachar may find
[1:35:19] himself enslaved.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; This is what the Bible is saying.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Let's read again my friend.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; He said and became a what?
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; A servant to what?
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; In other words, they are forcing him now
[1:35:32] to labor.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; They begin to force him with taxes.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; That's right. In other words, there is a
[1:35:39] risk
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; to be forced
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; to labor
[1:35:46] as a slave.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; It is good to be willing to work.

[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Come on now, brother.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; And don't find yourself being overused.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you get me. God bless
[1:36:31] you with strength.
[1:36:33] God bless you with talent.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; I can go with this in business, in your
[1:36:39] life, and move on. God bless you with
[1:36:42] another ability.

[1:36:46] something, but watch out this watch out.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can find yourself
[1:36:54] already under slavery,
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; under servitude.

[1:37:10] my child. Keep my child. I can't do it
[1:37:11] today.

[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; The problem when I when I'm reading the
[1:39:49] Bible, it looks like I'm the one
[1:39:50] fabricating things. I'm not fabricating.
[1:39:53] We are reading the same Bible.

[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; I was not even married. I was single.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; I said why? He said you see North
[1:45:40] Carolina the beauty of the city and this
[1:45:43] this. I said brother God didn't tell me
[1:45:46] to move.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; I was single. Sister Sharon was not
[1:45:52] there. I say if you move you move
[1:45:54] yourself.
[1:45:56] [Music]
[1:45:57] [Applause]
[1:45:59] The brother moved and he never stay in
[1:46:02] Texas.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; Later on, he moved to another state.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; He left Texas. What about if I would
[1:46:07] have follow him?
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; But when I look at his life today, he's
[1:46:13] in big trouble.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; And me who stay on my position,
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; look where I have it.
[1:46:22] Amen.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying the people in Texas are
[1:46:28] not blessed. Uh-uh.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; The people that are in, if God put them
[1:46:32] there, God will bless them there.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; I'm just giving you an example not to
[1:46:36] follow
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; people.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Because when God will be looking for
[1:46:42] you, God knows where he put you.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; And there will come a season
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; that God will come where he put you
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; to visit you. Yes.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; In your promised land.

[1:48:29] [Applause]
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; When you go to Issaka, what does Issaka
[1:48:36] tell you on Wednesday?
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; If you say, "Let's go to downtown on
[1:48:40] Wednesday," what does Isaka say?
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; No.

[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; So this tribe is also blessed
[1:49:30] from the sea.

[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; God doesn't take you and put you in an

[1:52:13] [Applause]
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; where you find yourself dominating by a
[1:52:19] man.

[1:52:24] libert for your liberty, your freedom.
[1:52:27] [Music]
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; Let's go to 1 Chronicle chapter 12.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; This stuff have to go slowly. give a
[1:52:46] prayer.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; And I'm sorry if I don't preach what I
[1:52:51] need to preach. You understanding this
[1:52:53] now. Me and you, we know this type of uh
[1:52:57] stuff already.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. That when we get to the church, we
[1:53:01] let the spirit to do what he want to do.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; If you there, you can say amen.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; 1 Chronicles 12. This is Issachar.
[1:53:15] You there?
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; 1 Chronicle 12 verse one. Now these are
[1:53:21] they that came to David to Ziglag. While
[1:53:25] he yet kept himself close in other word
[1:53:28] hiding because of Saul the son of Kish
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; and they were among the mighty men
[1:53:35] helper of water
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; war. So when David was already hiding
[1:53:39] from uh from Saul,
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; leader by leader,
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; people begin to leave the kingdom of
[1:53:46] Saul.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; And they begin to come
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; step by step
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; to the kingdom of David. They begin to
[1:53:54] transfer
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; to David
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; because the anointing of God
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; was already in David
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; and they s the anointing was going into
[1:54:06] David
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; and the anointing left Saul.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; So over time the people begin to migrate
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; from uh the kingdom of Saul
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; unto David and David was now growing up.
[1:54:23] Yes.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; Until the Bible say he became like a big
[1:54:26] army of the Lord.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; And we can go through this step, but I'm
[1:54:32] going to skip and go to Issachar. But if
[1:54:35] you go straight, you will see that there
[1:54:37] was so many a thousand from Judah, a
[1:54:40] thousand from Benjamin, a thousand for
[1:54:42] so leader by leader, the church of David
[1:54:45] begin to grow. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the
[1:54:56] The church
[1:54:58] the church was growing from the people
[1:55:01] that were living
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; at the churches and coming to David and
[1:55:06] David continued to grow as a big army.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; Because
[1:55:15] the anointing was already indicating
[1:55:19] where God is. A man after God's own
[1:55:22] heart.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said David
[1:55:24] represented Christ.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; So over time Christ will draw everybody.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; And Christ is not brother Steven.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; But the message brother Steven is
[1:55:37] preaching is Christ.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; It is the sermon. The message that
[1:55:42] brother Steven is preaching that is
[1:55:45] drawing people.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; Not brother Steven. The message. Amen.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; The message, the word
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; that is coming up is pulling people.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; Don't get mad on me.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; When you getting mad on me, you getting
[1:56:01] mad on the word.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; Because I'm not the one doing that. It's
[1:56:05] the word.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:12] [Applause]
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; How do I know all this stuff?
[1:56:20] with my intelligence.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; No, it is the almighty God.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; That is using me as a vessel.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; But it's Christ who's talking.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; And it's Christ who's attracting his
[1:56:31] children because the hour is late.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:38] [Applause]
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; It's hard to say things like this
[1:56:44] because people will say he begin to show
[1:56:46] himself up. I don't care what you say.
[1:56:48] I'm simply I'm speaking the truth.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; Go ahead. Go ahead.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; If you want to bring people to your
[1:56:53] church, preach the message in its
[1:56:56] purity.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sister, wherever you are,
[1:57:04] if you state preach the message
[1:57:08] correctly, God will send the ego.
[1:57:12] Because where the carcass is,
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; where the caucus is,
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; you won't block the ego.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; The ego will go where the car is.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Yeah,
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; my friend here I'm having a steak,
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; mashed potato
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; and gravy
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; and you are sitting there with a 25 cent
[1:57:46] chips
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; and you look in there it's food.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; What is your normal sense? You say
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; drop this my friend
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; go get go eat.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; If you stay there you starve.
[1:58:01] [Applause]
[1:58:07] We got problem in the message because
[1:58:10] some are preaching the message, some are
[1:58:12] lowering and playing with the message.
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; And now it's a problem. If you preach
[1:58:18] the message, we preach the message, we
[1:58:20] won't have any problem.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; But you don't preach the message. That's
[1:58:24] why it's a problem. That's why the
[1:58:26] church is called
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; the restoration of the word bring the
[1:58:33] restoration of the power.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; So the ego are not after the preacher
[1:58:40] they after the word
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; where the cases
[1:58:44] that's where the ego goes.
[1:58:54] Are we together?
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together? That's why God got you
[1:59:00] in trouble with the internet.
[1:59:02] [Applause]
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; Because now ego can search themselves
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; and say, "Preacher so and so over there
[1:59:08] in Europe. Preacher so and so over there
[1:59:10] in America. Preacher so and so over
[1:59:12] there in Africa. He preaches the word."
[1:59:15] Every day they sit. No, no, no. They're
[1:59:16] not looking at the preacher. They are
[1:59:17] looking for the word.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; Don't get jealous of the preacher. Go
[1:59:22] dig the word
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; and preach the word.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; Where are we at, my friend?
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; You remember when I lose GPS, I come to
[1:59:37] you. So, you need to stay on board.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; Where are we at?
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; Ah, chapter 12. So, the people begin to
[1:59:45] migrate
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; and David begin to grow.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; But we are focusing on the tribe of
[1:59:50] what? Issachar.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; Where is Issachar in 1 Chronicle 12? Job
[1:59:57] to verse 32.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; If I can finish this reading, Lord have
[2:00:01] mercy.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; Are you there?
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; You there.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; Now before we read together, remember
[2:00:09] Isakar is strong.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; Love stock right there. Blessed
[2:00:13] peacefully. Everything is there. He got
[2:00:16] the gold. He got the the what? the
[2:00:18] mineral, the fishing and the everything.
[2:00:21] Happiness is in his tent and everything.
[2:00:24] The only risk that is uh Issachar is is
[2:00:27] to avoid to be put under slavery.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; Because of this risk, look how Isaka
[2:00:36] compensate
[2:00:37] [Music]
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; to keep watch over the risk.
[2:00:42] Amen.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; In other words, Isaka you are blessed so
[2:00:45] much
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; but be careful there is slavery around
[2:00:48] you
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; and because of that Isaka got a weapon
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; against slavery.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; What is that weapon?
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; Now we are getting into
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; into the meat.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; Verse 32. And of the children of what?
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; Which were men that had what?
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; Understanding of the time.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; Understanding of what?
[2:01:11] God knew
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; the season.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So Isaka knew the season.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; I'm reading the Bible. Issaka, the men
[2:01:28] of Isaka,
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; they were not just like prosperity,
[2:01:32] prosperity.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; Our land is rich. All right.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; Our land depend on agriculture.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; So we need to be watching the time.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; We need to know which time is good for
[2:01:45] the flock,
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; which time is good for the agriculture,
[2:01:48] which time is in other words, Issaka got
[2:01:51] a wisdom.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; To discern
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; the time.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when David is about to take
[2:02:02] the throne, God touched the man of
[2:02:04] Issachar
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; to bring wisdom to David.
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; Now David, you need us beside you
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; because we know why how to discern the
[2:02:15] time.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; We can tell you what to do.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; Isakar have an understanding
[2:02:23] against this thing.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; So if you try to bring uh slavery to
[2:02:28] Isakar, They will just look at you like
[2:02:31] this and the discernment kick in.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; They say, "Watch out my brother."
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; Isaka, it's men that have what?
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; Wisdom.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; Wisdom.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; Understanding.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; Understanding.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; Understanding of what?
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; Of the times.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; Is it not? Is it singular or plural?
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; Plural.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; Understanding of what?
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; The times.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; Not just time, but times.
[2:02:55] So if you want to know the true
[2:02:57] calendar,
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; how things are supposed to go
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; when you get in Israel, which tribe do
[2:03:01] you have to go to?
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; It's a car.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; You see now that this prosperity,
[2:03:08] this richness, this wealth is connected
[2:03:12] to wisdom.
[2:03:14] [Music]
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you get it. This wealth
[2:03:18] of the land is connected to wisdom.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; I'm going to repeat it again. This
[2:03:24] wealth, this prosperity is not just
[2:03:27] prosperity without any guidance. It's a
[2:03:31] prosperity connected to wisdom.
[2:03:35] [Applause]
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; It's a white hair.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; There is a wisdom that is in that trap.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; It's a trap connected to wisdom.
[2:03:46] Amen. Yes sir.
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; So the message is not just rich.
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; But the message is rich because the
[2:03:54] wisdom the mind of God
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; is right there
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; and help us discern the time.
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; So when we see the pope is entering
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; the man of Isach begin to prepare for
[2:04:10] the going home because they know how to
[2:04:12] design that time.
[2:04:19] Are we together?
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; Spoken word. Are we together?
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; See, Emanuel, we together.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; Let's go, my friend. The Bible say in
[2:04:27] verse 32, and the children of Issacha,
[2:04:30] which were men of what?
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; Understanding.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; Understanding of what?
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; That's to know
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; what Israel ought to do. So there is two
[2:04:42] ability in is in Isaka. The first
[2:04:46] ability they have a discernment of time.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; Lord discernment.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Of time.
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; And the second ability is what?
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; Knowing what to do.
[2:05:04] [Laughter]
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; Knowing what to do.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Yes sir. Amen.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; There is a difference between
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; recognizing
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham preach a message.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; Hearing
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; what is the next one? Hearing.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; It's a title of a message. Hearing
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; recognizing and what?
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; Acting upon the word.
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes,
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; we must say if we sit here and we hear
[2:05:43] cling cling cling cling cling cling
[2:05:44] cling cling cling to this building what
[2:05:46] do we say it's telling you fire
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; you know your alarm is set
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; but what do you do
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; because some people when they say the
[2:06:00] alarm is set they get hysteric
[2:06:02] and they hit the wall and they go over
[2:06:04] there they no no when the alarm is
[2:06:06] coming when the trumpet is sounding.
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; We heard the trumpet.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; We know it's the trumpet of Jubilee.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; But what do you do with the trumpet of
[2:06:17] Jubilee? The one who knows what to do
[2:06:20] will take his uh whatever he's working
[2:06:23] on
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; and drop it
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; and look to the task master
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; and say get your badge.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; Goodbye.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; I'm going.
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; If not, you going to stay right there.
[2:06:37] not knowing what to do.
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; Issaka is a tribe that knows understand
[2:06:48] the time.
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; But Isaka doesn't stop in understanding
[2:06:54] the season. Isaka also move forward to
[2:06:58] know what to do with the season.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; In other words, now is the season to be
[2:07:04] blessed.
[2:07:06] Ah,
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; I know that. So, if it's a season to be
[2:07:11] blessed, what should I do?
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; What should be my behavior?
[2:07:16] [Applause]
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; How should I behave?
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; Because if you don't know how to do,
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; you are stuck.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together?
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; If you hungry,
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; and you recognize where do you hungry?
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; But if you don't know where food is,
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; amen.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; But if you know that they told you that
[2:07:48] food is in a refrigerator,
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; when hunger hit you,
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; you first understand hunger,
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; but you know what to do is to go to the
[2:07:57] refrigerator.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; Are we together? And the Bible say the
[2:08:02] tribe of Issachar is a tribe that
[2:08:05] understand the times, they understand
[2:08:07] the season and they know what Israel is
[2:08:11] supposed to do.
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; In other words, when a prophecy happen,
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; Isakia will look
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; and say, "Okay, the Messiah have come."
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; Let's prepare ourselves.
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; Because knowing what to do based on what
[2:08:32] you recognize.
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; It is time to go. How do you know?
[2:08:38] Because it's there.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. I know it's time to do, but
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; what should we do now?
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; So what do I do?
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; You lack the knowledge to know what to
[2:08:53] do. The Bible say and they have
[2:08:55] understanding of the time come to know
[2:08:58] what what Israel ought to what
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; ought to do.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; The heads of them were 200 and all the
[2:09:06] brethren were at the what
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; commandment.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; If you notice if you go home and you
[2:09:10] read this chapter many tribe came they
[2:09:13] were bringing natural strength.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; They were coming men of war men of war.
[2:09:20] Men of war. When Issacha came, he didn't
[2:09:23] bring war,
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; He lived peacefully.
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; He's working with his his wisdom. He
[2:09:30] said, "David, we don't have any weapon.
[2:09:32] We have the supreme weapon.
[2:09:35] [Applause]
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; Judah might bring you a sword. God might
[2:09:40] bring you a sword or or an arrow. But we
[2:09:43] we bring you the head.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; We bring you the head.
[2:09:49] We are bringing you the capstone
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; and that one knows what to do
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; because the head tell Elisha where the
[2:09:58] ambush is.
[2:10:02] [Applause]
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; Even Israel fighting need intelligence.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; The intelligence is what prepare war
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; and send the the the soldier on the
[2:10:14] ground and the soldier are going based
[2:10:16] on the intelligence. It is the
[2:10:19] intelligence telling you what to do.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; And the intelligence of Israel was
[2:10:24] coming from Issach.
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; Man of intelligence, man of
[2:10:29] understanding that knew what time is,
[2:10:33] what season is and what to do in a
[2:10:36] particular season.
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; In other words, they will tell you this
[2:10:39] is the season to crop
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; for crop. This is what you do. Amen.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; It's man that knew how to succeed.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the book of
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; Esther.
[2:10:58] Ah, Lord have mercy.
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; The book of Esther, chapter one. I'm
[2:11:05] almost finishing with my sermon with the
[2:11:07] reading of the sermon of the scripture.
[2:11:10] [Laughter]
[2:11:13] If you there you can say amen.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; We there.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; We there.
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; God give prosperity.
[2:11:22] He associated prosperity with
[2:11:25] understanding of season.
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; Because the understanding of season and
[2:11:31] what to do will guide prosperity
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; where prosperity need to go. That's
[2:11:36] right.
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; Because if the season change, you can be
[2:11:42] caught off guard.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; We clear.
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; Esther chapter one. Esther, we went
[2:11:50] through this book a long time. You know
[2:11:52] what it is. So, we going to just touch
[2:11:54] the surface and move quickly out because
[2:11:56] before I get trapped.
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; Esther chapter 1:3. If you there, you
[2:12:02] can say amen.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the third year of his reign, he
[2:12:06] made the feast to who?
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; All his princes.
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; And who?
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; Servants.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; The power of Persia and Media, the noble
[2:12:16] and the princes of the province being
[2:12:18] before who?
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; Him. And when he has show when he showed
[2:12:22] the riches of his glorious kingdom and
[2:12:25] the honor of his excellent majesty many
[2:12:28] day even 104 score day which is 180
[2:12:32] days. So king Ahazeris made the first
[2:12:35] feast. Do you know this?
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; And this feast the Bible say he made a I
[2:12:40] mean a I mean a feast to his princes
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; and his servant. It is not a feast of
[2:12:48] the sons
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; because there is a difference between a
[2:12:55] son and a servant.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Bradam says this in the message
[2:12:59] question and answer. He says now
[2:13:01] remember the church is not his servant.
[2:13:06] [Applause]
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; The church is not his servant. We are
[2:13:12] what?
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; His sons
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; not what?
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; His servants. The Jews is always his
[2:13:17] what?
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; The church has never been his servant.
[2:13:21] It's been his what?
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; His children.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; So the first feast is for the Jews.
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; Because the Jews have seven church ages.
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; I won't get into that. Help me move
[2:13:34] forward quickly. In the message, the 10
[2:13:36] virgin and the 144,000. Brother Brham
[2:13:40] said, "Now remember, if you look here,
[2:13:42] he say now what? Remember
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; and look at here now and what?
[2:13:46] &gt;&gt; Remember
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; two different messages.
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; Now remember the servant has always
[2:13:53] God's servant is what?
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; The Jew.
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; Abraham was who?
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; His servant.
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; The Gentile is not a servant.
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; It is a what?
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; A bride.
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; It's what?
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; A son.
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; This is son. The church is the Jews are
[2:14:07] what?
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; The servant. So right here the first
[2:14:10] feast is a feast of the Jews people.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; We clear together.
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; It have nothing to do with us.
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; And it's a feast where the king was
[2:14:19] showing the glory of his riches.
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; This is what God did through Sandra with
[2:14:25] Israel demonstrating who he is.
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; We clear my friend?
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; Job to verse five.
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; If you there you can say amen.
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when these days were what?
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; So the kings. So the first feast has an
[2:14:42] expiration date.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; There will come a time when that
[2:14:48] dispensation
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; will expire.
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; I hope we together.
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; There will come a time when that feast
[2:14:55] will stop.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; What happened? The Bible say after this
[2:15:02] uh uh these days were expired, the king
[2:15:05] made a feast to who?
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; All the people.
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; No more servant only. The feast is made
[2:15:12] to who?
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; All the people.
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; Not the servant and the princes. Now
[2:15:17] everybody
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; is called a feast to all the people that
[2:15:22] were present where
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; in Shushan the palace

[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; To great and what
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; small. How many days?
[2:15:31] [Applause]
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; After the expiration of the first
[2:15:37] dispensation, another dispensation open
[2:15:40] up.
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; And and the dispensation have how many
[2:15:44] days?
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; Seven days.

[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; So it's a dispensations of how many
[2:15:51] church ages?
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; Seven churches
[2:15:53] &gt;&gt; are we together?
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[2:15:55] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; Seven church ages. Amen. Seven days.

[2:16:08] king. What?

[2:16:18] the king with the first group of people,
[2:16:21] another dealing, another deal open up.

[2:46:52] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:46:53] &gt;&gt; When Moses speak for face to face with
[2:46:55] God. When Moses went by, the Bible say
[2:46:58] they were reading Moses in the
[2:46:59] synagogue. Amen.
[2:47:01] &gt;&gt; Every Sabbath.
[2:47:02] &gt;&gt; Sabbath.
[2:47:02] &gt;&gt; Because Moses became God,
[2:47:06] &gt;&gt; not God to worship.
[2:47:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:09] &gt;&gt; He became God to Pharaoh.
[2:47:11] &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible says.
[2:47:13] &gt;&gt; Are we together? In other words, if you
[2:47:15] want to have the description of God,
[2:47:20] &gt;&gt; only the one who saw brother Khala.

[2:47:49] this. This is his picture. This is our
[2:47:53] creator.
[2:47:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:54] &gt;&gt; This is our lord.
[2:47:58] [Applause]
[2:48:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:48:03] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:48:05] &gt;&gt; On the seventh day, who preach?
