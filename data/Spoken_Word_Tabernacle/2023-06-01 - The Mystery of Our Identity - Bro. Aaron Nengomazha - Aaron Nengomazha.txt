Lord God for the prophet told us that the purpose of a gift is to make people to believe the finished work of Calvary for father you paid the price you paid for our healing order you paid for the for our Salvation you paid for our joy you prayed for everything that we need you have already provided for us and tonight Lord we say we believe we accept father our healing Lord we accept our God our

the minister outside and speak directly to us oh god father may you Lord God and lift the burdens of those that are carrying parents Lord it could be precious in financings it could be precious from families are different pressures that we have in this age Lord you are still the same for you said look unto me the ends of the Earth and be his savior we thank you tonight for your great salvation we commit this service into your hands may it be to thy glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you you may have your seeds appreciate your musicians I think I taught you last time that we wish we were musicians so that we don't have to retire when we get to heaven we'll continue ministering but unfortunately myself and brother Shambo will retire in the rapture they may call us to preach in the Tabernacle of the millennium I will refuse I don't know about you I'll never preached when Paul is in the congregation oh brother Brandon he said the congregation maybe brother brother Stephen can preach do you love him tonight amen we appreciate you for coming to church we appreciate our pastor our brother Stephen Shambo for the invitation this definitely feels like home to us this is our second home when we are called when we are called to come here we we don't ask if it's God's will we know it's God's will we simply look at our calendar amen you don't ask the gods will to go back home amen that's your duty you have to go back home you don't pray you say Lord can I go home no after you finish work you have to go home praise God so so this is my second home if the calendar is open amen the only time I may say no is if I don't have the word from the Lord praise be to God and we certainly appreciate you and love your church and we love your pastor and he's a wonderful man of God amen and we bring you greetings from the Saints in Hickory they love you and they send their greetings to you amen do you love him tonight we don't have a very long message today we try to preach the message of the hour just keep it in one hour [Applause] because the bride shall not enter into tribulation [Applause] don't worry the pastor will straighten me out amen you know we carry the attack of young minister so we are allowed to make mistakes praise be to God amen God is a god of a variety sometimes it makes you chuckle so that you may remember the sermon amen God has a sense of humor believe that too amen praise be to God many are called but few come to church on Wednesday amen all right let's let's let's go to the reading of the scriptures we hope this is working it's not built amen do you love him anyhow when you see the enemy fighting it means he's already defeated [Applause] you know he he he tries to fight with technology praise be to God let's read maybe from Genesis verse let's do it from verse chapter 2 very sorry about that let's read from verse 7 and the Lord formed Men Out of the Dust of the earth and breathed into his nostrils amen the breath of life and Men became a living soul amen let's pray one more time Heavenly Father we are your children Lord this is Father where we Rejoice this is where we we are happy oh God when we are in church for we are home we know father that we are in our house be with us Lord when you bring father the inspiration from the reading of these words and speak to your children tonight we commit the service into your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you may have your seat maybe I'm pressing the wrong button that's it Oh Praise the Lord yeah so let's also read this scripture Colossians chapter 3 verse 4. we have it on the screen the Bible says when Christ who is our life shall appear then shall we also appear with him in glory amen he says when Christ who is our life so Christ himself is our life today by the grace of God we want to talk about the mystery of our identity amen sometimes when people hear the word mystery to them it's a turn off because it's something that has been abused but if something is abused it doesn't mean it's not right amen praise be to God anything can be abused Hallelujah a cause can be abused drugs can be abused but you don't stop taking medicine because some people are abusing medicine amen praise be to God this picture has been abused but we cannot stop using it just because someone is abusive amen amen some people have been in abusive marriages but we cannot abolish marriage because there's been abuses Hallelujah praise be to God so when we say a mystery we are talking about something that was previously hidden but now has been divinely revealed amen and the key word is divinely revealed amen no doubt it could be revealed but the question is was it divinely revealed so something is divinely revealed if it's revealed by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost is divinely revealed when it's thus says the Lord It's divinely revealed when when when when when when the messenger catches the mystery of it and it brings it to the people Hallelujah so when we say it a mystery we are preaching something that has already been revealed we are not revealing the Bible we are preaching what has already been revealed and brother Branham was a prophet and he was a revealer of the word of God and he had the mystery of the word for this age amen and by by him being the messenger he revealed to ask the word of God and we as ministers as Levites we are not revealing the word we are preaching what has already been revealed Hallelujah because the Bible says in the days of the son of man so in the days of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the midst of God shall be finished and the Bible says that Elijah shall restore all things amen he may he didn't have time to explain a lot of things he could say if I if I had time I could spend four months on this one or six months on this one but he said I believe that men shall come and take this word and sweep it to the coming of the Lord and make more sense to it Hallelujah that's the continuation of the ministry Hallelujah amen and God bless you thank you so much for pulling tonight I I I I I I I was praying and I said I'm gonna be teaching tonight amen so I I appreciate the amens but I hope you will bear with me tonight this this church pulls so much before you know it you leave your notes you know they are they are restaurants like that they will bombard you with very good starters before you know it you're full they said sir here is your main yes your menu for your for your main dish said wow I'm already full after one hour you know you you haven't touched your nose but that's good sometimes that's what the Holy Ghost wants Amen to leave your notes into Justice go as the Lord is leading amen but we know that we are living in an age where we need teaching if there's something that we have been lacking in this age is teaching very good Bible teaching amen because teaching establishes the church praise be to God because we have to come to maturity remember last time we spoke about maturity and maturity can only come when we realize Who We Are amen and if when we are positionally placed through the teaching of the word Hallelujah because remember in Acts chapter 11 verse 23. the Bible says that that's where they were first called Christians and it was at a place called Antioch now Antioch was a city that separated the east from the West Hallelujah so Antioch is more like when the East and the West meet and they call it the creator of Christianity Hallelujah and the Jews they were running away from persecution from the time of Stephen and they were going all over and and they were going as far as Antioch and they were preaching in Antioch and there were many disciples that were converted at Antioch Hallelujah so when when that when the apostles that were at Jerusalem they heard that they were Christians they were people that had received the message in Antioch they've sent Barnabas Hallelujah a type of the five-fold ministry and when Barnabas came to Antioch and he saw that these people love the world what did Barnabas do verse 24 he went and found Saul of tasers Hallelujah and when he found soul of Texas he brought him to Antioch Hallelujah and the Bible says in the book of Acts that the they taught the word for two years going through the Bible going through the Hebrew Series going through adoption going through the silver for two years and after two years they were first called Christians at Antioch Hallelujah praise be to God after two years of good teaching they were called Christians at Antioch Hallelujah it's Antioch where the East and the West meet and brother Brahm says we have come to a place where the East and the West is metagana Hallelujah and the word yes to be revealed one more time [Applause] yes praise be to God Hallelujah because we have to come to Perfection now the word perfection it just it has two meanings all right can I can I use maybe I'll get some of brother Stevens an anointing here one meaning of the word Perfection is sinless right and this is what people think when they hear the words perfect they say something has to be sinless or or blameless when they see someone who has got freckles or pimples they say she's not perfect because our idea of perfect is something that is sinless or spotless which is fine and then the second meaning of the word amen this one is maturity amen that's the other word for what for Perfection it's maturity amen we don't have time to go back to the Bible it's maturity is completeness Right amen completeness amen so this one only Christ is pretty sinless and we ourselves can never be sinless except through faith in Christ because he is our righteousness so no matter how good you are you can never be sinless because of your nature amen you may say brother Aaron has never touched a woman what about your thoughts what about your thoughts what are you thinking right now it's because of your nature so so because of our nature we can never be righteous except through Jesus Christ he is our righteousness and that's why we call him Jehovah the Lord is our righteousness [Applause] [Music] amen and the other words for Perfection is maturity or completeness so when we say that he gave the five-fold ministry for the perfecting of the Saints we are not saying for this that they may become seamless no we are saying they may come to the maturity Hallelujah Hallelujah so when you come to the maturity you have come to you can nothing can be added to something when it is mature amen it's full it's complete Hallelujah so each seeds amen Psalms chapter one Hallelujah he brings forth his fruit in his season so in the time of Luther the maturity was for you to come to justification amen Hallelujah but at the end of the age we must come to full maturity where we become the full word of God [Applause] Hallelujah but you see here is where the devil confuses you if you are on your journey to maturity and then you make a mistake and then the devil says you're finished because you're not perfect but he is confusing this and this that's exactly like Hallelujah just because you make a mistake there's no doesn't mean you're not perfect you are perfect before Christ yes sir because the sacrifice was perfect yes [Applause] Hallelujah you have not yet come to maturity but you are perfect [Applause] Hallelujah [Applause] so now so in Genesis God was creating life created marine life he created bird life he created he was going up creating life and when yet come you know the prophet says that that the lowest full of life is a frog and where does he get it from it's because when God was creating life he was growing up up up up up up and on the seventh he says on the sixth day he says let us create men in our own image in our own likeness so the highest form of life amen is God the highest form of life is Zoe Hallelujah praise me to God Hallelujah so the highest form of life is not driving a Rolls-Royce the highest form of life is not living in a mansion the highest form of life is God [Applause] sorry amen this is life according to the order of creation Hallelujah and it has to be in the image of God and in the likeness of God that's why when God came to Israel he said be holy for what reason because I the Lord your God I am Holy in other words you are supposed to be me because I am sure Hallelujah so we are talking about identity tonight you know people they try to to put a tattoo on their body to be unique they try to you know you know the tint their hair to all kinds of things to to make themselves unique but if you're a Christian you are already unique because you have the life of God amen there is nothing that you can add to subject you have the highest form of life God has already made you different you you don't have to do anything to make yourself Special by being a Son of God that makes you special and you cannot go higher than God when God created man nothing was created he said I am going to take a rest so if you try to go higher you're actually going backwards amen you can try to put some earrings you can try to you are just going backwards the highest you can go is to become like God hallelujah praise be to God what manner of love the father is bestowed upon us that we must be called the sons of God he didn't say what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we drive a Bentley behold what manner of love amen that the father has bestowed upon us that we live in an expensive suburb we live in expensive not sir is there anything wrong with those things no but that is not what we are trying to achieve the Bible says seek ye first the kingdom of God as he is righteousness and all these things shall be added the problem with people is that they are trying to put the cut before the horse it's a professional they try to fall after Prosperity if you are a son of God which you don't fall out the prosperity Prosperity follows you amen because David said surely goodness and mercy follow me all the days of my life pray to my blood amen praise be to God yes my brother people are busy they were looking for for for mining minds and gold you know in the in the early days California they call it they call it the Golden State because people went there because of the gold rush you know people looking for goats I'm looking for oil brother pranam would be sitting in a restaurant eating spaghetti or Panic pancakes and the Lord would show him oil cracks in America these things were following him but there were people who were skipping ropes and skipping Bridges to find mind claims [Applause] Hallelujah once you are a son of God it's from your works [Applause] then you wrestle your works you rest from social media you don't have to worry about matters you don't have to worry about sisters when the time comes for you to get married yes yes [Applause] amen you rest from your works you're not changing your profile picture every four hours [Applause] [Music] praise be to God I'm not against what's up I'm not against your profile pictures I am not a an Islamic extremist I'm just illustrating something here amen because we don't want our sisters to become like you know those Muslims that walk like litter boxes you only see their eyes that's extreme hallelujah praise be to God but you know what when Jezebel heard that jehuahu was coming she went on a profile picture [Applause] Hallelujah [Applause] because you are the Son of God when he saw that he didn't say oh look at that he said throw it down [Applause] Hallelujah our identity we have an identity crisis the devil attacks identity we are living in a time where young people there is a debate whether they can be called a man or a woman that's how far the devil is gone destroying people's identity amen when when the prophet saw it he said the prophet when he speaks he's not looking at today he looks at hundreds years down the road when the Bible says men shall not put clothes that pertain to a woman and a woman that pertains to a man people thought well he's just you know the Bible is just being hot but now look at the problem ah you know we know what is a woman ah we don't know what is a woman identity so the enemy attacks our identity when when Russia invaded Ukraine one of the first things that they did they were destroying a cultural places of Ukraine because they wanted to destroy the Ukrainian identity they destroyed you know the biggest airplane was from Ukraine amen they just they destroyed it because they did not want them to have an identity Hallelujah even when people joined criminal gangs the first thing they do is they change their name and you know they say okay now you this is the your new family and this is your identity and that's what the devil does and that's what the devil has been doing in this age [Applause] Hallelujah when Daniel shared with Meshach and I bet Nico went into Babylon the first thing that the king did he said I'm going to change your names up so that you forget who you are preach my brother Hallelujah and he said You shall not be called Daniel you shall be called built a shaza the prince of The Magicians amen and enticing them and you know what he was a prophet but the devil tried to to pervert that gift Hallelujah praise be to God every single that we have in the world came from the church whether it's Elvis Presley Michael Michael Jackson they all came from church [Applause] so he attacks the identity he said your name is changed you shall not be called Daniel you shall be called uh built to shaza amen and the next thing we're gonna change your diet amen we are going to change your diet you are going to eat the king's meat amen and look at how the devil likes to frame this the Kings meet something it sounds very very fancy Hallelujah this is the King's meat this is the best best brisket in all of Southern America you think I'm talking about meat I'm talking about spiritual diet checks this word and he brings a new diet he brings Netflix up he brings Hulu he brings this he brings that he brings data until the diet is changed Hallelujah but Daniel said we shall not give the king's portions we shall eat vegetables we shall eat the Bible we shall eat the message of the hour that's why God said to Joshua be strong and courageous not to fight people but to keep the word not to turn to the left or to the writer that takes courage [Music] hallelujah praise me to Carter and this was the second Babylon remember there are three Babylons in the in the Bible the first one was the Babylon of nimrod we don't have time to go into that and there's the Babylon of nebuchadnezza and we are in the last mystery Babylon and the devil is still doing the same tricks [Music] when the decree came from from Nehemiah and Israel they were like three decrees to go back to Israel only a few people went wise because they'd lost their identity they had become used to Babylon they were used to going to work every every day they didn't care about going to church they didn't care about family outers they had completely changed their identity that's why God had to bring a persecution for Jews to go back to their homelands otherwise they were not going to go back because they'd lost their identity they they got European names amen Vladimir zelensky that's a Hebrew that's a Hebrew boy but now he is amen but you look at this nose they say this is a Hebrew amen Albert Einstein Hebrews Jews hey man you lose your identity over time identity Marion Webster says it's the distinguishing character or a personality of an individual so what distinguishes us as Believers it's not the church that we go through it's the holy spirit it's Christ in moffatt in US amen let's read here according the prophet says you have to have a credation or a card or a fellowship card or something to identify yourself as well they know where you come from and where you're going to say at the platform you have to be identified and it's identifying age amen you have to identify yourself they came to John they said give us your identity who ask you you didn't say Hey listen I'm drawn my father's name was Zechariah he was a priest no sir he identified himself by the word he said I am the foreign [Applause] like the colored woman from Memphis Tennessee she said I am the shinamide woman where is my Elijah identification time who are you identified with tonight [Music] I identified with the football stars some are identified with music stars but we I am identified with Malachi 4. [Music] Hallelujah praise be to God we have to we have to know our identity because our identity is connected with your origin and our origin is connected with our destiny [Music] promises I was with Elijah in the days of ihab went there to make a choice who they would serve God obey them amen we we was with him on Mount Carmel amen when he had to make the choice for we are identified in the body of the same God that he was identified in so if we were identified in that body then we must remember we were with him that's right so Elijah said I was with the prophecies I was with Elijah on Mount Carmel and to remember there are three showdowns the prophet says this and the last Showdown is this one it's called the Mount Zion Showdown and for every Showdown there has to be critics they cannot be a showdown without critics they have to be websites huh that rise up and concise the message they have to be people that big slider oh that's they can be a showdown whether the message is right or not amen the people had lost their identity and to Elijah to come and because remember the spirit of Elijah is the cure for a a a a a lukewarmness it's a cure for being double-minded because when Elijah repaired the outer yes and he prayed he said Lord yes that they may not that's you are the true gods and I am your servant number one they have to know that I am the true God that you are the true gods secondly yes I am your servant that's very important don't stop here amen I am your servant number three in that you have sent me and you are telling you are turning their hearts so these people that was Mount Carmel and at Mount Zion the same thing has to happen your heart cannot be turned until you see the true God and you see his servant and that's when you can know that the Mysteries that were spoken it was not William Branham it was Jesus Christ speaking of the church Hallelujah praise me to God because Elijah said how long shall you stand between two opinions and you know that's that's the problem with the people they they get an amnesia until they lose the identity and they are standing between two opinions and whenever that Spirit comes upon the Earth God has to send Elijah he has to send the spirit of Elijah amen so now we find out that when Elijah came on Mount Carmel now these people now when you are in between it is what we call spiritual nightmare the prophet says it's when you are caught between two dimensions the purpose is when you are having a nightmare you are caught between two Dimensions you are not awake and you are not asleep you are in between dimensions Hallelujah and brother helped many people that were in between Dimensions because the spirit of Elijah amen that's what it does so that's what was The Showdown at Mount Carmel he had to give them back their identity that they were Hebrews [Music] amen [Music] comes says if God be God save him shall we serve God shall we serve the denominations amen and after the head held their peace James Anthony saying men and Brethren hacking unto me Simeon has declared now God at the first did visit the Gentiles to take out of them a people for his name no no no God the prophet gives us One important principle in the scripture one of the principles is that God deals with Gentiles as individuals and he deals with Jews as groups as a group when you read 104 000 they were saved in one day that's what Isaiah said we have seen such a thing before Zion traveled she brought forth her children but Gentiles are not served as a group now as simple as it sounds a lot of people get confused by that because you know the devil is especially now there is a pressure of groups there's a pressure of tricks and plants and people want to be associated with movements and things and and that and social gatherings but you know what I'm not I'm not we listen we can never run away from groups yes you have a family group you have a work group that's all not what I'm talking about but our Salvation is Gentiles is not a group salvation that's why there is no specific local church that is going in the rapture the Rapture is for individuals [Applause] and one thing that you see you will never see eagles flying as a group eagles they don't fly as a group [Applause] they fly as individuals there's an individual revelation [Applause] Hallelujah the prophet said what is the new birth what is a new birth it's a personal revelation of Jesus to shoot is not a group revelation don't say oh they are doing this or in the message they're allowing this who are they who are there it's your personal revelation even if my my husband's backslide I will continue honor even if my pastor breaks lighter I'll continue on her it's an artificial revelation [Applause] we are talking about your identity you don't belong to a grouper you belong to the mystical body of Jesus Christ amen that's the problem with young people they get accomplished what everyone in school is doing this everyone is doing this you don't have to do what everyone is doing there's no one that ever succeeded by following a group [Applause] you can matter of fact you can never make money doing what everyone is doing you have to solve a unique problem you have to have something unique and different or because the spirit of fashion is the spirit of Babylon uniformity this is all that we do as a group and you know because we are living in the Harvest Time where that that shaft is being bound together Hallelujah and the way it is being gathered together in the world you have to be very careful of groups [Music] listen even in the same church if you see something doing someone doing something wrong don't fall after them [Applause] amen don't say well wow he said oh he's an office better that doesn't matter anything say Lord help my brother you continue on your journey Lord help my sister she'll continue on your journey because it's an individual affair [Applause] Enoch could not have been raptured if he was doing what everyone was doing but when he was 300 years old he began to walk with God and what is to walk with God people think to work with God is you know when he was working with you side by side that's that's what they show you in the in the movies you know when you see in the pictures like the Jehovah sweetness they draw a picture of you and Jesus that's not what it means to say you are walking with God first of all you have to know who is God God is a spirit so to walk with God is to walk in the spirit because the sons of God are led by the spirit of God Hallelujah when you walk in the spirit you are walking with God when you walk in the flesh you're not working with God amen in The Exodus oh my hahaha but I one time you know the service was long and an elder said if I don't let my people go Exodus chapter 1 verse 17. but against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue against men or beast but that he may know how that the Lord put a difference is God that puts the difference between Israel and Egypt we don't differentiate ourselves we don't separate ourselves seemingly it's the Lord that makes a difference amen the True Church of Jesus Christ the bride is likened unto pure gold hair righteousness is his righteousness her attributes are his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him what he is she is to reflect what he has she is to manifest so the true church is identified with Jesus Christ amen I just need to read one or two quotes and then I'll close you bear with me amen it's like almost nine right now So Daniel I think we spoke about this they changed his name his name meant God is my judge and they changed to be in hananya God is my God is favored and and they changed to Shadrach amen such a beautiful name and the devil takes that gives you such a worldly name you you remove a long skirt and you wear something you know ripped jeans you look like a homeless person like someone who is so something wrong why are you working with ripped jeans Hallelujah man some of us think brother it's time to close as soon as you touch these deep the jeans laughs amen listen friends we need to go out of this world and go to the other world right now people are talking about boycotting things we are boycotting this because you know they are doing this or we are going to boycott this he said you go run out of things to boycott the only boycott we can do is to get into the rapture that's the only boycott we can do is to get into the Rapture you read articles people say I'm no longer going to Target and the next time I'm no longer going to Walmart are you going to live in a cave because because that's what the world has come to the only way to to to to to to just get out of this mess amen the Bible says that Babylon has become a cage of hateful Birds and you know the dove cannot stay with the vouchers and hours and it has to come out of that cage and we have to go to the third heavens amen that's where our identity is in the third Heavens praise be to God amen you know the post talks about about you know the third Heavens you know the Bible the prophet teaches us to live in the Bible that the the first Heaven is the sky hey man the first Heaven is the sky because the Bible says the birds of Heaven now birds of Heaven it's talking about the skies that's the first heaven and the second heaven is the celestial is the stars is the Galaxy amen now people are looking through the telescopes they are seeing billions and billions of galaxies because they cannot exhaust it's their second heavens and the third heaven is the spiritual heaven where we are going and that's where we have our identity friends amen can I read one more quote good amen the Bible says that two women shall be grinding together one shall be taken and the other is left it's an individual Revelation don't say well I went to this youth camp and I saw everyone doing this you stay with the word don't don't worry about what everyone else is doing [Applause] I I even saw pastor's children there no you stay with the word amen because the pastor is also praying for his children I'm also playing for my children so don't look at my children look at the word [Applause] amen [Applause] praise be to God it's not right here in the backs of this book saying you are catering too much to the people to walk with me you walk alone you are putting too much emphasis on those signs that's what God Said to the prophets you are working with too many people and sometimes we get into trouble because we are trying to cater for too many people now I'm not saying we should separate ourselves I'm saying we should leave a separated life separating yourself is a couch but living a separated life is Christianity [Applause] we are not like the you know like the I won't mention names when they say we just live in our community we don't talk to people no you you're nice to people you talk to them when they say hey Eric can we go to a dance well I I'm sorry I don't do dances but next time if maybe you have something different I can join you guys that's what separation means I apologize you know that was just about half of of the notes but I hope that it was a blessing to you and I hope that you know who you are and you find your identity in the world friends our identity is our power our identity is who we are you are a daughter of God you are a son of God and you mean much more than the devil can give you amen Son of God stand on your ground daughter of God stand on your grounds there is a lot of pressure you know with social media you see a lot of things it it it gives you so much pressure but you know a lot of things you see on social media is fake it was no one who ever post on social media that hey we were fighting at home no people won't do that they only post you know the nice things so you don't have to follow that you follow the word you do what is right never compare yourself with the next person [Applause] one sister said oh honey listen how come you never opened the door for me when I get in the car I see brother Stephen opening his his keep the door for his wife oh honey the door is broken that's why the brother has to open it [Applause] God bless you Saints who will see you praise God praise God praise God praise God let's give the Lord a big clap of it [Applause] glory to God usually tell the young people and I stress that a lot to the younger dog do not follow what people put on WhatsApp it's a lot of fake stuff a man who's having the real thing don't need to post it let me start it over again can I start it again the day you will get the real money you won't show off [Applause] did I say something wrong did that say something wrong the day you're gonna find what is happiness you don't have to show people happiness I don't need any posting not even one when you see me you will have the definition of happiness amen when you come to visit me and my home when you enter my home my home will give you a message amen when you sit with me and my children and my wife you will know who I am I don't have to show you what I'm eating I don't have to show you my couch I don't have to show you how my bedroom look where is this thing coming from wordliness and I'm gonna say it clearly because I know how to put myself in trouble and get out of it everybody okay everybody okay many message believer have lost their identity watch on social media watch what people are doing they have completely lost they don't even know who they are if you understand what is the caliber of a message believer you will even watch what you're doing and I was telling someone recently I say we the parent we are confusing the young people [Music] there you know I don't know if you get me the pastor is preaching something amen the brother and the parent are listening the same thing but when they go home the younger child is expecting the parent to leave what he heard the pastor preaching but when he turned around daddy's not leaving what the Practical is saying now the young man is confused so now by the behavior of the parent the word of God Becomes of non-effect because Mommy never thought before she's doing what she's doing because daddy never thought what is he doing before he's doing what he's doing mommy has a Personal Agenda Daddy has a Personal Agenda and the children are calling for something higher and they look at Mommy Mommy doesn't read the Bible and but they're telling the children to read the Bible but mommy never read the Bible she's always on the phone you are confusing the identity of the children we telling children go read the 70 weeks of Daniel we're telling the young people go read the church edges mom is always on the social media mom is always looking for something else that is always doing this and this and this they never seen a true Christian Life that have been expressed before the children that's where the biggest crisis is that's why brother Branham say it is not children delinquency it is what parent delinquency if you don't come to church how are you going to teach your children to go to church if you don't pray how are you going to teach your children to pray everybody okay everybody okay if you don't clap hand in church how do you expect your child to clap hand in church if you don't say a man in church how do you expect your boy or your girl to say a man in church everybody okay if you don't come to question and answer how do you expect your children when they grow up to be in question and answer why how do you expect your children when there is prayer for them to come to pray you never showed up in the Lord's Supper how do you expect them to be in the Lord's Supper what desire do they have to have in the Lord's Supper we are confusing the young people by our Behavior that's why you see young people out of the message young people out of the message brother I deal with a lot of families not even in this church outside of this church I have people that I deal with my wife is there I was called to a funeral I sat down just a few minutes with somebody there are people that were there in few minutes the Lord showed me what was going on in that person's life and I told him straight ahead and I even told him I said if I sit with you two hours I will tell you more about your life what is going on what identity are we projecting in a home what identity are we projecting in our work what identity are we projecting at the restaurant what are we doing when that waitress is coming what are we doing when we're in school what are we projecting are we projecting what you've been preaching here or as soon as you leave this church you put it down and you have your own stuff that you have to do and message believer have developed two lives they have this Sunday service on Wednesday service life versus their own life so they go to church like religion when they go out they will do exactly whatever they want to do even though it's contrary to what they have been preaching Church they will still do it you don't know who you are wake up we need to find our identity amen the true you is not this one the true you is not the one that was born from your mother the true you is the predestinated city your true identity you are an eternal Son of God from eternity this is who you are this is the man that God loved he said I love Jacob we saw it on Sunday it was not this Jacob there was another Jacob that God loved amen they picture God have for you in heaven is not this picture because some of you went into the world and you came up with a tattoo is God going to have a tattoo on your picture if you repent the tattoo will be still on your body but your glorified body doesn't have tattoo and brother Branham said the picture God took of you was the picture before the foundation of the world I have the court that is your true ID that's your identification that is who you are and it's individual let's remember who we are before you react remember who you are before you go somewhere remember who you are before you post something remember who you are and I'm gonna say this children of God are not stupid there is a level of discernment in the brother we can look at your picture and we see what you're trying to say without you saying anything I have looked at paper paper like this and I say this is what the person is asking and somebody who was there argue with me they say no that's not it I said this is what they're saying they didn't put it on the paper they say no I say call the person they ask the person that he was exactly right if I would have went with what they written here I would have missed that what is the identity we're showing to the children what is the identity we're given in our work what is the identity we are Christian your identity is personal God is calling you for that personal work if every young people in the message don't want to work with God you walk with God if nobody in this church want to follow God you follow God because by the end of the day somebody will stay here and someone else will go into the Rapture they read the scripture here when they say there were two in the field one was taken the other one was left don't be among those that are left be among that Rapture brand that will be taken to meet the Lord into the air let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly again tonight father once again thanking you for your grace for your love for your mercy father and for everything you have been doing for us father you brought your servant tonight Lord to deliver the very thought that you put in his heart Lord and father by him touching the two aspect of perfection he didn't even know what was laying in the slide that have not been even untouched but I understood the signal that you gave me but what I'm praying is I'm pleading so that Lord father each member of this church and even those that will be streaming later and worldwide may we wake up to realize Who We Are father it was a long time ago that we saw crazy haircut into the world it didn't take loot too long those haircuts got into the denomination and today what we are witnessing is young people in the message cutting the haircut exactly like that but still the people are still joking the people are still playing the people are still doing what they want regardless of how much you're pulling because Lord father spiritual Amnesia have struck and the people have not remembering who they are but father I pray in the name of Jesus Christ that you break that spiritual nature father May the mercies of God be once again pour down upon this church that you break every complex every Spirit of stubbornness that is protecting and creating a shell that no matter how much the world is coming is hitting a dead wall father you the one that brought the walls of Jericho down father all I see behind is people that are enclosed in prison that think that they are right they have a high opinion of themselves and they don't want to Humble themselves before the word of God and the greatest curse that I can see father is somebody who thinks that they are right when they are wrong father may you break that from the people and may you lose them completely out made the realize that whatever accomplishment we can do in this world it will stay and all of them will be volcanic ashes may we understand what was spoken tonight to seek ye first the kingdom of God so that the other things will be following us but not us putting the court before the way Lord father I pray that you strengthened brother Aaron father remember him and his family father this is a very tough time that we are selling but we know that you built us for this hour that's why we have courage and we are continuing to press on but we need Lord a patch from you so that we can stay on that Firing Line Lord father remember spoken word Tabernacle remember every family that is part of this church and even those that have been subscribed Lord and become a family all over the world Lord father that you touch them that this message don't go and Loud fathers sit in their intellect but there's the soak down deep in their soul so that somebody will be set free and found who they are and be able to be reconciled with their family like you did to the man that was possessed by religion father continue to consecrate your children Lord I pray that you move that pressure that is pressurizing the things of God until we can do anything we can program event for five hours for six hours but when it comes to reading the scripture at home we want to do it quick we want to pray quick we want to preach quick we want to go home quick but when we reach home and look at what we are accomplishing we spend more time on our phone more time on conversations more time talking on the phone being on the computer entertaining one another versus Lord father investing for a spiritual walk and for the Inside Man father you spoke through your Prophet that the Holy Spirit Lord feeds upon the word father I don't know how much I can emphasize because the power of a religious spirit have soothing into this message have heard so many lives and put them into a comfort zone that they think because they just part of this message they will be raptured there is no more pressing there is no more interest to the things of God if we cross our mind wrong we won't do it anymore who are we father what do we have that we have not received from thee you can call anybody home tonight and their life will be finished and whatever project they have for tomorrow is stop right there father work each one of us remove all this foolishness from our life prone to everything that needs to be prone of Our Lives remove this demonic pressure that have clogged up our schedule we are so busy accomplishing nothing and by the end of the day our spiritual Wonder our body are tired and tomorrow we wake up again to go back on the same race father pull us aside Lord let each one here each person that will be listening to this may we go home and Ponder may we sit down and meditate where are we what are we reflecting who are we fighting with what are we trying to accomplish which identity do we have what are we working for what are we trying to achieve with what we're doing help us out father hurts when the things of God are dump because of pleasure it hurt when the spiritual things are neglected because something of a belly spirituality pleasure have taken more than the praise of God and the people who tried to press on have been ridiculed by the people in the message but father you encourage us tonight to walk alone to move on because at the end we have a good expected end father may you protect the children may you help the young people father if the parent don't want to line up father don't let them be influenced in the wrong way but let them Lord be sucked into the word and don't let them suffer because of the condition of their parent load father give them a personal revelation to understand that it's not a matter of family it's a personal work and relationship with you Lord father may you protect each one of us as we go into our respective place father grant us travel of Mercy and give us more boldness again father to fight this fight because we need help from thee we thank you for speaking to us bless your children touch Lord father dosed that are suffering in the body may you heal them Lord those that has been Lord father attack abusing their mind and their spirit by the devil perfect left and right father may you give them peace and heal them touch Lord those that have lost a significant one may you comfort them may you protect us may you bring this church to relax who they are father your Prophet says that if a man is filled with the Holy Spirit he will esteem your word above his necessary meat father May everyone look at their life and see how are they valuing this message not by word because everybody will say we in the message but we find life what are we doing father I pray as a shepherd we're doing the best that we can but Lord may you be merciful because without you there is nothing that can be accomplished father protect us and lead us and guide us in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah go ahead brother said [Music] draw me to the cross [Music] es please I am done [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] Glory Days [Music] [Applause] [Music] to thy precious reasons [Music]
