more the blood of Jesus Christ amen amen glory to God there is many things that the old atonement took care of it and let people pass through what about the blood of Jesus Christ with the true

Blood let me just leave it alone amen the Covenant that you have with God has nothing to do with what happened with Moses he goes beyond Moses do you know the first priesthood that killed the Lambos who it was God himself in the Garden of Eden so before even Moses came up with the law God already started but before the Garden of Eden before the foundation of the world the lamb was already that's where God look at you that's why why you were yet sinners that Covenant can go through a courage amen and pull you out of the courage when you were drunk you're still drunk you're not Christian yet when you are drunk he will pull you out of a car wreck and everybody else died and you come out drunk but you don't know him yet amen it is beyond what you can imagine amen because God will lose none of it it is beyond that's why the scriptures say why you were yet sinner Christ already died for you in other words he doesn't have anything to do with it we're looking at the sacrifice at the cross once that sacrifice is accepted everything else will pass through amen so never look at yourself look at cover amen take your hand off of yourself look at Calvary that was the scripture I skipped on Sunday and I wanted to read to you then you can see why Paul could say forgetting all things let me move forward forgetting everything that is in the past he knew what he was talking about because if we keep looking in the past then he will see all the mistakes that he made every day how he persecuted the church and put people in prison and blasphemed the word of God and everything the Bible said if you blaspheme the Holy Ghost there is no more Mercy For You Paul called himself a blasphemer preach how is Paul savor why is Peter saved and not Judas why they have to pray for Peter why didn't Jesus say please Judah I pray also for you he only prayed for Peter why not Judas none of these he looked at his children he said the one who will struggle is Peter so he prayed for Peter not Judah and he knew Judah is going to struggle but he can't pray for Judah that is something Beyond and Peter didn't have the Holy Ghost yet I'm trying to stir you on so you can look at the blood amen that blood is powerful amen everybody good with the body change now you're ready for the body to change the way that I've never seen before it keeps coming up and you will see that brother Brian even the

that right for his answer we come to tear down we come to tear down root up and build up is that right by the word of God by the power of God by the anointing of God this is our our sanction huh I'm speaking to the Bride of Jesus Christ brother Branham said what go hunt My bride is that what he said we're hunting a grind so we go into the institution we're not coming with a denominational message

nobody want the spare tire all the time her brother Steve huh it's nice when you come humbly but if God's got to make you ah if he gotta make you huh everybody's been called for a purpose Hallelujah you got the gospel with John okay in the beginning was the word and the Word was uh who the word was with God and the Word was God and the same was in the beginning with God verse 14 he said and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word uh you know we're looking here tonight and even though we don't plan to be long not didn't have many scriptures we want him to have his way you know in um the thought was on my on my heart when I heard the Holy Spirit near the end say the uh infallible word of God so a topic tonight God's word is infallible God's word is infallible you know when the Lord is dead I'm not forerunning what the Lord going to bring in about a week or so but we're just going to put our little Lake of Fire here tonight by the grace of God and we want you to look at here we've heard a message we heard the prophet of God working uh this but we just want to hit a little portion of it and you can go numerous rate ways in the scripture when you start talking about the infallible word of God and when you start talking about the infallible word of God that's what the holy spirit is moving us into now when he came and he ministered us and he showed us in the beginning was the word the Word was God the word was with God but we know many will take that scripture the nomination will take that scripture and try to apply that scripture to them but we'll assure you by the grace of God if you don't come from God you can't go back to God you know so we know we recognize in as many things I heard the Holy Spirit say Sunday also we got to change that way of thinking and he's saying he's not just saying it but when we go and look into a few scriptures tonight by God's grace and he help us and you'll see but we we coming basically out of the message and if you don't have any notes course I don't have the born but it's 10 354 the word became flesh made flesh is that right so you have to just get around in real life so you have to understand if a person come up here and try to imitate someone else I wonder if you called to preach amen you can only be the way that God Made You because God is the is the Potter and we are the clay is that right we were in the mind of God before the foundation of the world is that so we're coming in here and now God is shaping us and molding us the last time when I was here we was talking about the True Stone nation and the religious Stone Mason because our our battle is salvation versus religion it was always that way from the beginning remember Cain and Abel and when Cain enabled God offered up what Abel said received able sacrifice because the Revelation was given unto Abel Abel knew exactly what God was wanting at the time so we have to understand now you all have to worry about big see the pastor can say certain things but I learned to minister if you're sleeping I look away from you ah Hallelujah so you understand that we got the hand of gracious extended to you I know something worked some come we thank the Lord for you but God's going to show you that reward he will not forget the Faithful is that right so we're gonna have to look in the head we'll look in the scripture here tonight but let's look at infallible now we get here see we lost help us Lord because that's what we're moving into the Holy Spirit showed us Sunday that now what has come down is what the word of God is that right what came down on Sunset now was the word of God is that right what the word of God for your day you're knowing the mind and the Heart of God for your day is that right the almighty God looked upon us and shed his grace and mercy upon us to put us in the overcoming age is that right we get around that's what the pastor was saying when he was saying before we came out some of you have to write you're not rightfully dividing your life well if you're not wisely dividing your life what Satan is doing is pounding on you but he's only pounding on you because he's coming at you when you was a sinner amen amen you keep thinking the wrong way you see he kept saying take not no thought for tomorrow is that right you can add nothing to your statue Christ already took care of it for you we're just this is as we used to say growing up could I just be myself we home right ah you know we used to say you can't Cadillac out of here Satan Ain't Gonna Let You Cadillac out of here you might as well forget about it okay some of y'all don't understand that Concrete Jungle talking I don't mean you can't get a Cadillac what I mean is that you're not going to cruise an easy life out of here is that right so that's all we're telling you because the Bible says wherever it is good evil is what always presence is that right so we see some of you God is already changing your life son you already own the right road is that right I don't want to get ahead of myself but look at fallibility God's in infallible word it's incapable of error it cannot error huh we don't have the spirit of fear you trust in the Lord trusting God's word it cannot error it says it's an infallible guide is that right the Holy Ghost will lead and guide you into all truth is that right it's the God for you it's an infallible God it's incapable of failing it cannot fail it is certain if God said it I believe it that's it is that right Vista we're speaking to the Royal Seed of Abraham those that got legitimate reasons for not being here I mean for it God bless them but the ones that's that that well let me keep going help me Lord he said now he said uh the word is accurate other word is accurate it's perfect it's true huh huh I told I said Lord help me to stay on my point I want to be nice tonight but he's still going to have his way is that right okay Hallelujah he says now in the beginning what's the word the Word was God the word was with God and the Word was made flesh if you got it here I want to look or just read something that the prophet of God said and I want you to realize and don't catch it the wrong way don't you think like men okay he says I he says I see things this is I see things even in the vision things the Lord has showed me and turned right back around and do what vice versa is that right all he's showing you is we're going to show you is that right anything that came forth from him it was not an error on God's part a covenant messenger have thus say the Lord God had to train him he has to train us he has to train you so you're being trained look at the presence anointing because you're hearing the voice of God is that right and brother John you can see the musician coming to another level you can see the songs of singers coming to another level huh God is pleased you're on the right Road I'll tell you that road that you that we're on out there the Pastor said it was what threes is that right he said this is the third time God put a church in his area is that right huh but we won't We're not gonna lose this is the church is that right you know where Street he put us on he put us on Bernice is that right beneath me Victorious Victorious Rhoda we giant we're marching to Zion we can't lose God put us there of death where's dice thing oh great where is thy victory [Music] Hallelujah look what he says he says and God show me he said I had this in Lisbon he says I said Lord just take your hand off of me he says he said now look at him he didn't even think he was worthy fighting that complex that's all I'm not even worthy to be your servant to see something he he told me he says and I have forgot all about and went right and it happened and I thought my there he said I I thought my help me Lord there why didn't I remember that he said had it wrote In My Pocket a piece of paper and walked right into that doing something vice versa mean the opposite he says see there it shows how much uh how good I am see on the worst of all them would be me after God telling you to do something and you turn right around and do vice versa he said now so you see somebody and I believe the Lord when I was looking at this this would kind of prick my heart the next thing I'm about to read he said so no matter who the man is he's nothing but a human he's going to make mistakes so let's just suffer with one another let's suffer with one another let's forgive one another faith is based upon forgiveness so you can't move any further it's because you've got grudges you hold things in your heart and God came in that door that's what the Holy Spirit was talking about there last Wednesday that door to the heart is that right brother even that door you can't let them in because neighbors pride is not forgiveness I don't want to get ahead of myself but let me keep going he said now look he says now we know in the beginning was the word the Word was God where he was with God he said people make mistakes so let's just suffer with one another and do the best we can he said that's the only thing we can now let's move forward he said now look in the beginning he said now you can't he said in the beginning let's go with it the Holy Spirit must have a door ordained this now you can't go any further back mentally speaking then in the beginning let me slow down see I was telling a religious demon one time they was trying to tell him about they were the religion their faith was this I said Christianity no one can go back as far as Christianity no one because we were in the mind of God the Lord told us he showed us our origin our origin we're from Heaven we're from God is that right we were in the mind of God before the foundation of the world they want to read the slope because many are taking the word many are saying this but what the holy spirit is menacing here is not just something light when he say you got to go a little deep sometimes is that right huh that's why he brought the seals and it was Thunders was hidden up under the seal is that right is that so it can come and bring us what rapturing faith is that right it's not that you don't have it it's already inside of you it's already been planted inside of you it's just that what her sister sharing some see the Thunders when God show it to them they gonna see it but they're gonna see it when God shows it to him don't fail because I catch some of your spirits sometimes it's not that it's putting you down the pastor got to school you sometimes is that right he got a scold you you know that teacher that taught you the best that teacher that kept you in line when we were in school that's the one that we remember because they wouldn't move to the left side they wouldn't move to the right time if you did something wrong they just gave you more homework [Applause] exactly what everyone come on yes my brother then you know what you're going those uh Church ages conduct an order and then certain questions you won't have a pastor love what he does because God called them but anyone can get overloaded what you saying about Kelly you can take a feather right and hold the feather right there and you hold it long enough it's gonna get heavy is that right you see so we're not saying that we're not saying and you don't call the Elders and things for prayer if you need prayer but I'm saying the work that he's that he's assigning to you he's bringing you up to another level is that right I bet at least ah then that give him time is that right so some you'll learn you're lagging behind you know why he's not forcing anything if you notice he's saying now he's trying to find a place to stop why is he trying because now we're pulling we're hungry we're looking for more you see why because we don't believe we know where we at is God is in our presence and when you know that God is in your presence uh who wants to leave out of that presence is that right some can't go you know they're looking for you we thank God for the mystery we thank God for the Deep thing but what is the Revelation faith is a revelation just believe what you're hearing gotta unfold it to you I don't know why we went that way but it was help me Lord he said now look let's see what he said here he said now now you can't go any further back mentally speaking he said then in the beginning in the beginning before there was a world before there was a star before there was a son a moon anything else before there was any creature creation that's in the beginning is that right he says now as far as we can go is back to the what beginning they're with me he said now in the beginning he said in the beginning was the word and the Word was God and the Word was with God and the Word was made flesh he said then the word was Jesus Christ is that right he said he showed us and that what he's showing us when the Capstone came down Christ came down he showed the Holy Spirit showed us that Sunday he said that was who Christ but it was the word it was the word and spirit formed now coming from the what descending opening the word in his end time and that's what he say we're going to get to we're going to get somewhere tonight God help me he said now look he says now in the beginning was Jesus Christ he said now I'm gonna drop down to any beginning was the word he said oh we'll whine ourselves out with here in the good old scriptures let's look into the good old scriptures how I just love it you feel at home when you get into it you know that don't you love it we're gonna get into some scriptures in a minute help me Lord he says in the beginning what's the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the word itself was God and the Word was made flesh and droved among us and we beheld him in the glory of the father we beheld the word that was in the beginning he said become what become flesh on the Earth he said now what a marvelous thing to think that made flesh to take to do what Jesus came to made flesh to do what take away your sins is that right but now he's given you a clear run understanding about the ministry of the son of man is that right so you got to understand now you're catching and you tying it in with the scriptures when the son of man first came he came as a savior he came to Sanctified us he came and he said love to us is that right he came to redeem us is that right so we're talking about the son of man when he walked here on Earth he was what he was too wise to make a mistake he was too righteous to do any wrong why wouldn't you want to be like him because he lived a Victorious life huh whoa the blood Oh The Blood the blood don't sign my name is that right what's the blood today the blood today is the baptism of the Holy Ghost is that right he's coming down there his Spirit Fallen bringing you the word so you can read what live Victorious is that right let me keep going help me Lord we talking about now look he says in the beginning now now if we could get the Superstition of the world how they worship and want to become good see that's why you're coming and you recognize you can't bring the nomination Behavior up in here it's not going to work the holy spirit's going to call it out is that right because he recognized the ways of the devil so and what we're doing in this hour here now God said I shall restore with the palm of worm the canker worm the caterpillar the locals have eaten up the Catholic the Baptist the methodists all the denominations have eaten up is that right they wanted to stay settled bringing a word to transform you in the image of our Lord Jesus Christ they brought a word to deform they'll try to deform you is that right that's why the holy spirit said what do you say um last Wednesday brother I beseek you brethren I beg you I'll be with you by the mercies of God huh be not conform to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind and the only thing is going to transform you is the word of God let's keep going help me Lord he said now look he said that we beheld the word and it was in the beginning and become flesh here on Earth not with a marvelous and now what a marvelous thing to think that God made flesh to take away sin now we could get the superstitions out of the way now certain of their denominations there of their sex if man becomes real good he becomes a what a God imma jump a little bit here he said now look he said and another reason it hardly taught to me no let me see now but there it tells us that before there was a man in the beginning was the word and the Word was God and the Word was with God and the Word was made flesh now and about as far as the human mind can go that's as far as we can go back well to the beginning is that right but in the beginning was the word but now that's as far as we can go by the theology let's see what brother random going see what he's bringing you that's why when you heard the Holy Spirit say through the pastor son you got to change your thinking he said that's as far as we can go by our mind he said but Revelation carries us beyond that is that right he said if you're teaching something on Theologian you think in the beginning was the word you said that was God now we're talking about an intellectual way of teaching it you got to catch it he said now it tells God help me he said in the beginning with the word that was God and the Word was God that's right this same word was made flesh dwelled Among Us and God was flesh he says that's without controversy he said that's true God was made flesh we believe that but now this word what is a word and word is the manifestation of a thought amen you see let's keep going he said now it's the manifestation of your thought it is expressed of a thought he says is that right before you say anything subconsciously you think it before you speak it is that right that's why you have to understand the word of God it comes from going god with with taking on the mind of God the message that God sent for this hour which is the word of God is the mind of God so you pray and you read your Bible and before you answer he said be slow to speak quick to listen slowly wrath is that right thank you Jesus he said now the word of the manifestation of the authority expressed he says so in the beginning was the word he said that's as far we can go back this by this by theologies he but before the word he says what it was was a thought and and a thought was made what medicine manifest see what I mean he says now the first he thought he said now that's how he said first he thought he spoke the word and the Word was made what manifest is that right so you picking up the mind of God he comes down he opened the book he bring his word the word and the mind of god let's keep it just simple you see he says oh how and then he said oh how infallible God is what notice every thought when it's spoken Hallelujah he said no wonder when we come off because when he came off the hill remember when Jesus came off the hill and Jesus looked the fire off and when he looked the far off what he was doing he was trying to show him by the grace of God his thought he said he cooked he picked up the thought of the father is that right and he looked and he saw that it was what and that I tell you what let's turn to that Mark help me Lord I think it was Mark 11. thank you Lord foreign infallible worried of God God in his word is what one all one some of you looking at me don't think I'm trying to bring nothing different I'm just bringing it right by the scripture God and his word and the spirit is what all what there's one the Bible backs that is that right Hallelujah he said now look let's look for for the sake of time look at verse 12. he says and on tomorrow when they who when they were come from Bethany he was hungry and seeing a fig tree of far off having leaves he came happily he might find anything thereof he says that when he came to it he found nothing but what leaves for the time of fix of things was was not yet see we know those figs was the what he saw nothing but religion at the time he wasn't doing anything there for the people he had the people bound up it's just like they haven't bound up today we bring a message this message didn't come to bind you up this message come to set you free this message God is a gentleman and God doesn't put in any on anyone first he says what he says first you have to come in in his hour here now who got his body spirit and soul is that right and so he comes in when it comes see taste filled smell in here is that for what to contact your Earthly fleshly body for you to operate here on Earth it's something in that body is not working right then you have a little issues there he said then it come in the spirit man when most Christians believe they have it but they get their self thrown up when it comes to the spirit man is that right imagination memory reasoning conscience affections is that right God bring those things but he put us on what free more will is that right everybody's on free more will God's a gentleman is that right so that's when he said when you get out there in that outer court and that Holiness is right now you're on free more will he said then it's your soul is that right that's the real you it's your soul your soul is the real you and your soul even other races either doubt or is he the faith and when the reveal word come he The Operators down or even faith that comes down there so your soul a true believer's Soul got to germatize seed down in there that God put there before the foundation of the world and so he has your pastor he just hid the pastor there for a short period of time for that period of time until he now he puts him there's a deacon but deep down inside he's going to be what he was going to be a pastor is that right you get a double portion the prophet that God said when you got a pastor and a teacher you got a double portion he comes to you is that right so we're looking in this hour here now we want the reveal word of the hour is that right Hallelujah you're helping so Jesus knew it was that time but when he came down from the mountain he didn't see anything it says in Jesus and Jesus answered and said unto them he says no man eat fruit up there Hereafter his disciples and then they went into Jerusalem and Jesus went into the temple and began to do what cast them cast them and that soul and bought in the temple and overthrew up the tables of the money changers and the seats of them that what sold doves and then that not suffer that any vessels could carry any any vessel through the temple he says and he taught saying unto them is it not written my house should be called what all nations House of Prayer but we have made it a what a dinner thieves son so we're bringing in now God come to restore these things back in our day and that's why when the pastor put on the Holy Spirit put on his heart about to have that order and we had our family meeting is that right you can see now the fruits of it is that right he said you're bringing the true fruits of repent sentence and when you bring the fruits of repentance he said God has pleased them so when Christ now is put what preeminence is that right Christ is being put first in the church and things will fall in the order is that right it's the word in the beginning what's the word the word with God the word was with God we're talking about the infallible word of God on when Christ said something then it's going to happen we're going to get to a point to where Show You by God's grace who you are what the prophet was one to bring us to he never did away with the with the first poor second pull third pull he never did away with it they trying to tell him about Pentecost is that right you know I love to praise the Lord I love Rejoice I love the dance but it gotta be for him it's got to be for his glory it got to be for his kingdom it got to be for him he was telling them some brother was mentioned to him about the Pentacles and brother Brandon was saying yeah he told him about the Pentecost he says but like the house whether I'm just paraphrasing it he said the house wasn't finished being built yet is that right he told him you can't throw away the scaffold he can't throw it away the gift you can't throw those things away until the house is finished because the Gibson things were sent to keep it clean is that right and so as many as many lives being changed young and some are humbling their self to the mighty hand of God um and some of you are still fighting those religious demons is that right so we look around we are a body of family but God is dealing with individuals right now it's the infallible word of God that's going to be manifest before we leave here is that right it's not just a spoken word it's the manifestation of the spoken word he said now look what Jesus said here he said help us Lord he said now when God came and God said in Genesis 1 and 3 if you're writing it down he said God said let there be light is that right when God said I think I lost some spot help me Lord he said now look he said I believe Hallelujah he said but wait a minute amen said when Jesus no he said when he's dead when Jesus came off the hill that night and looked around the tree for food and there was no food you see and the next day coming back the tree had withered see God's mind brother Brandon said Jesus caught God's mind that was God's mind we're going to show you anytime God says something it got to happen you see we're moving into something look at here he says now he said nothing to eat the next day he said he said God's mine in the beginning that was thought before it was a word that was expressed Jesus Christ the same one was expressing the word back again see now he caught by God's mind God and the word or what what the hell one he's just bringing us into something of understanding this is what brother Brandon wanted to bring him into because he seen the people didn't have clearly understanding they were still struggling in about their salvation and things and like you so in this hour here now you got to understand he that believeth on the Lord Jesus Christ and is baptized shall be what saved is that right he said now once a person is believed now he's moving forward he's following the word of God for his day let's bear with me y'all I'm just a little gospel I gotta eat tilapia and rice tonight uh is that right you ain't got no steak and no Lobster is that right you can fake Lobster and when you get the pasta and you get some telepathies is that right he's that in the beginning he even give you some biscuits with cheese don't it huh so we gotta understanding what God is doing I'm just a simple gospel preacher let's keep going so we want you to see help me Lord he said now look Hallelujah he said in every word he said every word in the Bible is God's thought lady is bringing you to another level come up hear that is that right take the book eat the book is that right Hallelujah win a war a real war is that right what are you saying something what he's saying Psalms turning for him he said he spoke from the inside he said what open the gates uh he said who's coming the king of glory who is the king of glory and the king of glory his body in battle is a war going on every demon first that come across it got to move up [Applause] let me say but next time we gonna come we're just going to say sisters around here oh I'm having a good time I'll wait for this day Pastor Hallelujah this is a joyous life huh this is a joyous life the joy of the Lord is our strength huh praise the Lord huh blessings come up Praises go up blessings come now see if that was trying to get you wait when you had that song used to go I had my ups and downs sometimes when there was no one around God came and what spoke his word to me is that is that right we started dancing we started prancing we started shouting he said let that do that confused the enemy when the enemy shoot you down whether you're him say you heard the Holy Spirit straight through the past there's something coming here when everybody know they're going through something everybody know that they're struggling something going on just put it on the prayer list it's an unspoken request and just have everybody pray for you and you go on I want to get ahead of myself see see when God speak a word see it's already happened you got to go in a spoken word of the original sea when God speaks a word it's already happened you don't have to worry about it happen if God said it it's gonna happen the infallible word of God it cannot error it will lead you it will guide you it will protect you watch over you even when we were yet in our sins he still watches over us [Applause] Hallelujah he said now look he says then and every word in the Bible is God's thought laid in the seed form if received of the human being and spoke by the same thought that materialized in the Bible see brings the things to pass it says see what I mean how powerful could the could the church be he said the Bible said let this mind and that was in Christ be in you as a man thinketh in his heart Psalms 23-7 he says as a man thinketh in his heart now and now your thoughts if they become expressed see like God said huh let you let that let there be a world before it could be a word see he said let there be what light he said then before it could be a word it had to be a what a thought is that right he said God in his creation created the world by his word thought and his word is that right [Applause] first then he spoke it and the thought expressed became what materialized see what I mean let me look at these things let me see if we give these three verses he said here now look God said Genesis 1 and 3 he said God says let there be light and there was what it was light is that right he says and Jesus answering said unto them have faith in what god let's go over here to uh let me keep reading that I want to read them or um jump back over to mark I'm gonna jump a little bit here so y'all bear with me look over the mark chapter 11. until chapter 11. in verse 20. he said now he said now in the morning as they pass that they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots and Peter calling to them ran to say them to him Master behold the Fig Tree which thou what curses this is withered with it away and Jesus answering said unto them have faith in who see what he was saying so who was it that that the mind he picked up the thought which is the word of God is that right Jesus was the mouthpiece of God Jesus was the fullness of the mind of God in the beginning was the word the Word was God the word was with God and the Word was made flesh God the word the word the spirit and God is one is that right he come around and the father is one so now we're all becoming what we're being molded back into what in the image of God is that right that's why the Holy Spirit came powerful that's why the Holy Spirit came and said what when the Holy Spirit came it had to be in how many parts two parts is that right oh I can't cheat a little bit I can't get his notes his notes is going now ah I gotta go home and do my homework is that right he said now I can't get in there he said but it came in two parts is that right he said well after he came there in the two parts he said God has to do it first he had to come and then and now the inner man is that right ah we getting somewhere now that's what Paul was talking about Romans 7 he said the things I desired to do I did not the things I desired not to do but I did he said I'll tell you what let's turn there Romans 7. Hallelujah I'm jumping a little bit but that's okay have your way Lord he said now look he said when we come around in there he's telling you the Lord bringing you some of you troubling in that flesh shot and then you thought right uh you thought you're not saved uh you thought you didn't have it is that right but I just thought it happened huh oh he got it up there I need to throw him in the Baton don't worry Pastor I ain't getting out of my position right there I'm enjoying it is that right God made me this way I enjoyed it that way is that right look what he says in Romans he showed us the Holy Ghost he told us he said the Holy Ghost Paul had the Holy Ghost Paul was there and when Paul had the Holy Ghost and he had it down in what and his soul is that right but Paul was struggling with the two Natures Paul was struggling with the flesh uh Paul was struggling with the what the mind is that right we don't have to really struggle with the mind uh God has brought us the mind of God for this day and time is that right cast down every imagination and try to exhort itself against the word of God a move now if your word abide in me and I abide in you whatever you ask you can't receive [Applause] the infallible word of God is that right he told us oh I knew he couldn't redeem that flesh yet the dream because Paul said he only had Parts is that right that's all he had done he only had partner he didn't have the fullness that would come at that time so Paul would love to see and have the things that we have is that right Hallelujah look what he said Romans 7. but you don't get it here he says the believer is not made Holy by the law that's what he's working with he knew it let's drop down here he said to verse uh 13 and when that which is good made death unto me God forbid but sin that it might appear in working death in me that which is good he said that sin by the Commandment might become extremely sinful he said for we know that the law is spiritual but I am what carnal see just let it slow down a little bit see some of you be sitting there with them religious demons and you're sitting up in there and you wonder why that uh you can't go any further and that's why the last time when I was here that's what I was saying when you get there in order to lose quotas and quote this and quote that but now the Lord has given us a weapon is that right he's giving us a weapon where we're not going to fail is that right the words of the Prophet he's the divine revelation revelation of the word that comes to him for his age is that right so we got to step up come on up hither that's why I said you got a pastor of the age as well it's the prophet of God is that right you got the pastor of your house is your husband the Bible say if you have any questions first ask your husband at home is that right and then so then you have to understand what the Lord now is bringing us and the pastor for the local assembly is here the single women the sisters and things you know you come to them but you also pray and do your homework you try to find out where God is dealing with you at God dealing with you sister this and then somebody I know you desire for a husband is that right I know some of the young men Desiring wives but there's some things that we have to look at maybe some type of tradition one day I said we're going to look at the Traditions tradition I'll tell you put a lot of pressure on you especially some of you from your native different Native countries you're putting pressure on you making you think that you got obligations to the Homeland um but you got to pray and you got to ask God uh to lead and guide you in the direction that you need to go or God is a universal God and he's able to take care of them he's able to make a way for them he said I am the way I am the truth he said I am the life is that right he said no man can come to me unless they what come go through me unless then they can get to the father they got to come through me I'm that door is that right I'm the door I'm the way like Jesus say so you know what watch the way our sins nothing but the blood of Jesus when Jesus came here living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carry my sins Far Away Rise and he justified freely forever so you got to get out of your thinking that's what he brother Brown and preached that message lean not to your own understanding he did not knock school he did not knock education some of you young fellas around here big and strong huh Pastor you need to send them to me I put him to work we work them so hard they get enough jobs and they'll stay away from me is that right when they get around and around in there they'll get two jobs is that right don't waste your time is that right time is money you find people that waste time they got financial problems normally because you when you're a businessman you can't separate time and money is that right they base those things upon that about time and money how much a profit or how much prosperous am I going to get if I invest in this this so you have to understand the understand the way of the the way of the Lord and some of you young men well let me leave that alone Step Up hello anyhow give them a clap offer see you gotta understand I'm home I don't know I'm home grown born American is that right other Soul here is that's right so you got to understand that you know if I was on some of y'all soil then I would have to ask you to help me is that right but I'm telling you I'm fair I'm friendly but I'm firm is that right we're taking on the mind of God don't bring me no foolishness is that right little father needs to more Folly at least to Babylon it leads to they ain't talking emptiness is that right so we have to understand God has called you to be Overcomers that's right first you said what keep the Lord before you at all time is that right if you check with the Lord and ask the Lord the direction in thy path God is taking you a certain way to strengthen you is that right he's not going to leave you he said I'll never leave you or forsaken you he says you've never seen your righteous forsaken or his seed begging for bread is that right that's a fallible infallible infallible word of God that mean it will come to pass in God's time we're looking at something for to happen but it's already happened you just gotta walk in it it's already happened because God said it we coming to another level that's why you hear the preachers and the pastor keeps saying this is a new way of thinking you got to come on up he's trying to bring you up hither is that right this come to restore all the word back to the way it was is that right Adam Adam ran the earth when Adam was on the earth is that right huh Adam gave us an example when Adam was able he that and had what the infallible Mind Of God is that right Adam has an infallible mind of God the word of God was given to Adam he named the animal he named the giraffe he named The Lion he named the bear he was able to move a tree over here a rose bush over here you didn't he didn't need a landscaper he had what the spoken word is that right was the original seed of God the infallible word of God he don't let nobody speak nothing on you my wife and I went there shared his testimony why he dropped on me that's kind of appreciate I am I just I got to catch it when I drop we got around in there they went to the doctor the other day I don't care for the doctors anyway you know I only go there if I have to go he said I think the Lord for a doctor I'm not talking about you Pastor how about that I'm talking about the unsaved ones is that right huh the unstable because I was telling the fellow because you know the new drug dealers right the new drug dealers the drug stores they got all the corners out there they tying down all the corners you know what I'm telling you so we got to understand in there I'm not knocking it because I appreciate doctors I appreciate hospital I appreciate the medicine God sent those things to help us is that right everyone doesn't have Enoch Faith the prophet of God said Son don't have it some got to work at it and some just get it just like that but we're talking about it now I went there to the doctor and we got there you know certain organs on your body they just get old is that right as you get old they get over the flesh that's why the Holy Spirit put that down down there is that right the flesh is not going to be redeemed the flesh is always going to go through things the flesh is going to get old but that inner man brings that flesh and the subjection to the word of God that's what we're talking about so we get around in there he got there he said well you know she said uh we got there he says uh well you know this this little large he said but you know it could be cancerous and he said the only way that we can uh check it out just make sure it ain't cancerous and he said I said it ain't cancer stock he he turned around there and and looked at he said well how do you know I said it ain't cancerous doctor okay when we got around it by that time brother Steve the wife started pushing me I gotta I gotta be honest God gonna play it back when he got around in it right and when I looked at him and I said oh oh wait a minute honey I'm the patient I said I am the patient he looked at me and he said no she said how she looked at me she know I was getting up to eight and when we got around in there because it's something down inside where I can't deal with unbelief unbelief just can't Rest in Me so when he got in there and he turned around and when she got over he looked I said doc let me tell you something he said you know when you come to a doctor I know there's something wrong with your car he said the first thing you pray for is the least expensive way to get it fixed hey he went the most expensive way to test cause I already knew he wasn't right because whatever happened was huh I'm just telling you about these unsafe doctors I'm not talking about these righteous doctor I'm talking about the after that money out there I'm talking about they connected all together and when he got over there then he came around I said doc well the way you know he said well you know a better way is urine you know you can get a yarn that's the better way I said I'll keep that wife was sitting out there I went out there I left out of there he said he told the wife he said well you know it really is not that bad I mean the numbers really aren't that bad didn't have nothing to do with him or putting the doctors down you got to recognize when you got a bad doctor let me tell you another testimony I'm talking about for the pastor the Lord just dropped that in the mind of me have bad experience when he went to the dentist about 17 years old I prayed I cried I prayed I prayed and finally had to get there to go to his dentist and when I go to a dentist and we got there and it was on Sugar Creek it was already on a Sugar Creek and I said Lord I knew someone when I walked in there he was training and then he wouldn't he wasn't a dentist then he was in the training and when I walked in there I lit up I said this is the place right here because he was sitting there and I knew God had answered my prayer because we had all fellowship at the other church I'm telling you God know how to get God knows how to get you over what's struggling you on the inside God knows how to get you older he controls This Heart he controls the control tower we're connected with him and when I got then all was well you hear me always well so God sent me to the good doctor and God will also show you bad doctors is that right I'm trying to tell you in this hour here now you got to know the times that you're living in I don't know why we went that way but it's for somebody but I thank the Lord for our doctor Let's see we thank the Lord for our dentist is that right Hallelujah help me Lord he said look look at Paul he said Thank You Jesus he said now for we is that the law is carnal for which verse 15 for that which I do he says I allow not for that I would that do I do not he said but what I hate that I do he said but see look at all these things here and I'm gonna have to jump a little bit for the sake of time when Sona is here Paul Hart was right because Paul was Desiring to do what was right that's what the pastor been telling you you see Satan's just messing with your mind look over here let's jump down here he said now look he said now look and brother Brian he said what they do is in that situation when the devil and it started affecting you he said then that Cardinal mind kicks in when it's time to go to church and it's telling you what you're tired he's telling you're feeling bad uh he make you ill uh your author your authors start acting up a little bit though but then you have to look into the word and say greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world brother Robert you gotta recognize what is inside of you you gotta speak it okay let's look at Paul see what the Holy Spirit gave the pastor look what he gave me he said I find a what verse 21 he said finding the law that when I would do good that what he was present with me remember that voice he's always messing with you he's always going to bring you a wrong word he always wanted to bring a doubt he's always going to make it that think God can't do it but then not when God came over to Abraham and Sarah did not God asked him Pastor he said what is too hard for God is that right God asked him God put it back on you one is too hard for our God he's the omnipotent God he's our powerful God uh he's our present God he's here now we're two and three together in my name he said what I'll be in the midst of you the infallible word of God he's here whatever you need ask them in your heart he's here amen amen fly the light in the law God has to do what I Delight into what the inward man where we at up here the inward man thank you thank you in the inward man he said now look he said but I see enough and let me stop cause you just come to me see what you have to understand is just that when God give the pastor a word uh-huh is no that's right brother it's mine now ah it's mine now if you don't take it then you believe it's a man talking if you don't take it you believe it's a man I know it's not a man uh it's God uh is coming to set you free is that right brother rabbit it's mine now when he came with that message it's mine now I come from God I go back to God God came and redeemed me is that what he said marriage us back to the word and do what with the Plan of Redemption foreign thank you Jesus it's mine it's the word from here this is the Throne of God oh my my it's been that long oh my goodness y'all just give me about maybe five minutes help me Lord my my oh my so much to get I think the pastor number he don't been training us with these longer messages huh yeah let's go he said verse 23 but I see another law of my members warning against the law my what my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of what sin which is in in my memory you don't have to doubt nothing you have to doubt nothing sin is just unbelief is that right sin is just unbelief look what he says God and help me same book turn to chapter 14. same book if somebody just just needs to see he said now look once you have Romans 14 and verse 22 when she had to say Amen has thou what faith Heaven know what that have it to thyself before God happy as he's at what that could them not himself in that thing which he what love you see God needed God he said and he that what doubt of his what damn didn't eat he said because he is not a what for whatsoever is not faith is what so you got to get that unbelief out of you you're not going you're not going home taking the word you're not going digging in it because you still fighting some unbelief that war remember he said once you're cleaned up he brought them through the sanctification life but himself when he brought him through the sanctification like brother brother Polly cook when he brought him through the sanctification light he was showing them giving him a taste after the atonement is that right brother Berner said he was giving them a taste before they get into the atonement before the blood was shed is that right because then not Peter cast out that was here to sick who's the dead is that right then they do those things but the Bible said he wasn't even converted yet is that right but he still did those things so God was giving them a taste of it is that right he said but whoa Peter he said but I know uh that the devil did what the devil desire to what sift you like we the devil desired to sip you like we but what being found word of God said hi brother Robert but I prayed for you he said look he's turning over there Lord help me let us look at this one here at the road of Emmaus and let's go to that Luke 24 we'll stop at this one come on up musicians Luke 24 help me Lord oh my I didn't know it was I didn't know it was that much help me Lord [Music] thank you for your prayers brother John the only brother John all I need is one to say praise the Lord he was pulling then hey he was the one pulling hallelujah look what he said Chris I'm talking about the infallible word of God I'm talking I'm trying to bring you with what he said help me Lord let me see what he said if I can get down here to this one with one part he says help us Lord Hallelujah he said what could the lamb be a pig he said no he said he says well this same message 10 354 because I know something is streaming he says well his thoughts change something does something doesn't him change see he he said but a human can be changed from a pig to a lamb he said because he's got a soul inside of him he says so as a man thinketh in his heart is he he said Christ the Creator come to him in the still form his own Spirit took the man's nature to love he took he took the man's nature look at this here I'm brother Robert he changed the name in nature he now took away why they took us over to Ezekiel 36 is that right 16 and showed us typing it being what you must be what born again is that right so he was telling us folks he had to take away the Stony heart and they take away the Stony heart then he had to give you a spirit to deal with yourself is that right after he took that take it away and then he had to do like give you a part of what flesh is that right so we can mold you and shaped you now and after you do that then he had to do it put his Spirit he'd give you a new heart is that right and then so he put his holy spirit inside of you in steps of being born again now and then after he put his holy spirit inside of you that's the only way that you're going to be able to walk in this statutes that's the only way you're going to keep the word of God uh that's the only way you're going to do his will uh that's the only way Our Father which are in heaven Hallowed be thy name Our Father which are in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy Holy Ghost come so that thy will can be done I can't do your statue until the Holy Ghost come I can't sing right until the Holy Ghost come I can't dance right until the Holy Ghost come I can't pray right until the Holy Ghost come I can't love right until the Holy Ghost come I can't do this thing until the Holy Ghost come look what he says help me Lord bear with me children we getting ready to come to a stop help me now he said look look what the prophet of God said here help me Lord he said now he says as a man thinketh it was become a thought it came becoming words a word expressed materialized he said believe in in thy heart I am a Christian see because I have accepted the Lord Jesus Christ if I don't cry if I don't move if I don't do a thing in my heart first I believe that Christ died for me and instead he says I accept it as a Christian I believe it as a as a Christian he says then it's in my heart he said then Express express it in the word I'm a what Christian he says then I start walking as a Christian I start talking as a Christian I start living as a Christian I start being a Christian and by my fruits I'm recognized by the World As a Christian he said all those desires that was there did what now it's going away because I'm a Christian Luke 24 on the road of Emmaus help me Lord I'll cut it short let's start at verse 19. 24 19. we're talking
