pray amen amen God bless you you may have your seats thank you so much musicians our God is tremendous yes sir isn't he I say our God is tremendous what a wonderful song Amen I was just rejoicing back there praise God glory sometimes sometimes I like to sit in church during song service uhuh uh instead of being back just to yes sir uh but sometimes they don't want to break a protocol but sometimes I I like to brother Bram used to do that it just gives an anointing when you're just you know sitting there and worshiping the Lord amen because we come to church to worship yes sir that's what we come to do amen and and and and and God wants to be worshiped bring you greetings from our family I apologize my wife could not be here it was an emergency call she's pecking up we going to leave for Africa uh tomorrow so just doing a perking but I think she's streaming I know she's streaming this this morning so I say God bless you uh sweetheart you see these are the benefits of being a Minister's Wife you get to be greeted through the pulpit yes [Applause] sir but you see sometimes you're also corrected through the propit so there's a balance anyway praise the Lord so happy to be here and um it's it's it's a heavy for me to be preaching here and uh the Maestro is sitting in the in the front it's h kind of difficult so you you be you'll be praying for me so if we can stand and open our Bibles this is our second home and it's always a joy to come back here amen amen let's open to Psalms chapter chapter 105 verse 13 if you're feeling down go to the Psalms anytime you are feeling low just of course you can read any Scripture but go straight to the Psalms the Psalms are such a blessing I think in the Tabernacle they would read a Psalm every day you know because the Bible says worship God in Psalms hyms and spiritual songs 105 verse 13 the Bible reads when they went from one nation to another from one Kingdom to to another people he suffered no men to do them wrong amen yeah he reproved Kings for their sakes saying touch not my anointing and do my prophets no harm you may have your seats may God bless the reading of his word hallelujah so today I was a doctor on Cor so when the main doctor came I said I don't have to be on duty say I didn't he said I didn't bring my tools said maybe we should take your license anyway we will give him Grace hallelujah amen so for a little title we want to talk about uh healing in the atonement amen and for a subtopic we want to talk about the children's bread yes sir it's going to be a very simple message uh this morning so we hope that you stay awake uh uh just felt led God you know placed this upon my heart just to speak about this subject am there are many things that are in the Bible but you always want to go where the Lord leads you there is no big subject small subject you have to go where God is leading you to go amen because if we preach what we want then we are no longer Servants of God that's exactly right then we become Servants of ourselves that's exactly right you could be studying something and getting excited uhh but the Lord will tell you you Minister on this and you just have to obey the leading of the spirit yes sir many things that can be spoken about sometimes we we preach you know deep things and I enjoy those things but sometimes may God may say you go and preach on this sometimes God can say go and preach about baptism yes sir you know because God he knows there's a lamp somewhere that needs to hear that word yes my brother you have to obey the voice of the Lord yes my brother sometimes God can leave 99 that's right just to go for one that's right he can just have a service for one person that's EX exactly the prophet went to a place called mtown because there was a lamp that was bleeding Hallelujah like the call that Paul received to come to Macedonia yes sir he went there because of an Macedonian call that's exactly and we believe tonight that we want the Holy Spirit to lead us wherever we go that's exactly we don't we don't ever want to become too big no sir to where God cannot lead us no sir we always want to be sensitive to the leadership of the Spirit Hallelujah so here in the Book of Psalms yes sir the Bible says that they went from one nation that's right to another that's right in other words they were pilgrims and every Christian is a pilgrim yes my brother they went from one Kingdom to another kingdom uhhuh and the Bible says he suffered no man to do them wrong yes my brother he reproved Kings for their sake that's right God reproved Kings for their sake sake that's right he did not just to reprove any Ordinary People he reproved Kings for the sake of his children yes my brother and I want to tell you to this morning that he is still the same that's ex he's still able to rebuke a a governor for your sake he's able to rebuke a king for your sake amen when you are on God's side God will be able to take care of you amen amen hallelujah yes sir and he said touch not my anointed that's right and do my prophets no harm amen so he's anointed are his church that's right so much so that God says in the Bible in the Book of Revelations hurt not the oil and the wine amen amen he says do do everything that you want to do that's right but touch not the oil and the wine if you have Revelation if you have the holy spirit amen then you have God's protection amen amen amen you become one with the anointing that's when God sees you he does not call your name he says this is my anointing yes my brother touch not my anointing yes sir touch not my anointed ones yes yes it's the anointing that breaks the York that's it it's the holy spirit that brings protection that's right it's the holy spirit that brings cover that's right Hallelujah yes sir that's the only connection that you need that's the only link that you need is the power of the holy spirit amen amen one time someone asked me uh he says how are you able to get this position do you know someone I said yes I know someone uhuh he says is it a good connection I said yes it's a powerful connection says what's his name I said his name is Jesus Jesus is my advantage Jesus is my connection Jesus is my inside man he is everything to me Hallelujah am he is higher than the highest he is greater than the greatest yes my brother he is my Minister of Defense he my Minister of Finance he my finance secretary my he is my immigration lawyer he is my everything hallelujah hallelujah if you want benefits yes sir Jesus will give you benefits this morning amen amen J is greater than the Social Security amen amen amen amen amen and I am his officer this morning I am his officer this morning I say receive your benefits in the name of Jesus receive your healing in the name of Jesus that's right amen the highest office in the land is the Minister of the Gospel amen amen the highest office in the land is the Minister of the Gospel yes my brother we can over what any Minister can say that's right we can override what any government official can say that's right by the power of the word yes sir we can overwrite every doctor's report that's exactly right when the doctor says you can't be healed I say you can be healed you can be healed in the name of Jesus by the power of the spoken word yes my brother yes my brother we have an office that is higher than the doctor's office that's exactly right we have a name that is above all names that's right anything that can be named yes sir if you give it a name it's under the name of Jesus am if you call it cancer it's under the name of Jesus if you call it blood pressure it's under the name of Jesus amen amen amen hallelujah glory to God praise be to God yes my brother and he says and I and he said if thou would diligent lyken to the voice of the Lord there's no magic want you don't have to follow some great gifted person you don't have to follow some great gifted Revival you have to obey the voice of the Lord amen amen if you obey the voice of the Lord that's right and you would do that which is right that's it then God's blessings are automatic to you yes yes amen you don't have to go to a mega church somewhere sir you don't have to pay anyone anything you just have to believe and obey the word amen if you believe and obey the word amen all of God's blessings are yours amen amen amenallah hallelujah that's why we don't we don't measure on those things no sir all we do is preach the word amen if you believe the word amen then God's blessings are yours amen amen amen amen if you obey your parents uhuh you have long long days that's exactly whether you like it or not because you obey your parents God gives you long days that's exactly blessings come through obedience amen there's no magic want Hallelujah you don't have to run and Shake A Minister's hand that's okay just believe the word amen just believe the word amen if you live happy with your wife the Bible says your prayers you will not be hindered that's exactly it's an automatic blessing that's exactly right take your time you don't need any discernment uhuh uhuh God's blessings are automatic amen amen upon Obedience of the word take your time Hallelujah yes my brother someone came in the prayer line one time uhhuh he says brother Aon pray for me my business is not doing well uhhuh I said have you been paying your tithe that's it says no I've missed my tithe I said I'll pray for you to go back and fix that once you do that everything is going to be okay all right that's exactly right because that's the word of God that's exactly Hallelujah the blessings of God are based upon the principles of the word amen amen amen amen and today we want to uncover the enemy yes sir but sometimes people get an idea that there's a special man that will come from somewhere and they'll pray for me and everything things are going to be okay for me you don't need that my brother all you need is to believe the word all you need is to stay in the word is to accept the light of the hour that's it yes my brother your pastor has been given authority to pronounce a blessing in your life that's it if you love your pastor you stay with the word he will see you through it that's an automatic scripture that's it yes my brother yes sir Hallelujah yes sir sometimes we're always figuring things out you know but you know what God has already provided for us the answer amen amen hallelujah and we have to go back to these foundations because people forget them that's exactly right because people people are wondering oh maybe if I go to Nigeria then I'll get my healing no if I go to this Camp then I'm going to something is going to happen then I'll be healed you can be healed this morning in the name of Jesus Christ you can be healed where you are sitting right there be healed where are listening to the tape in the name of Jesus the promise is unto you and your

right Israel that's right you cannot curse what God has blessed uhhh it's a principle in the Bible amen amen there is no person that can curse a Son of God Amen it's impossible amen because it's contrary to the scripture amen amen amen one time there was a minister that was cursing Israel and they was saying death upon the Jews death upon Israel this year and before he could go back to his City dropped dead and he died that's exactly right God rebuked Kings for their sake amen you cannot Cur what God has blessed amen amen and here bam was told to curse and he said to bless uhhuh and he

it shall not har you amen amen amen hallelujah once you pray for your food it's okay my brother you can go ahead and eat your food nothing is going to Har you that's Hallelujah sometimes we become so scared too much oh I can't eat this I can't teach that whatever you want my brother I only pray for your food and say Lord I Thank You for Your my food food once you do that there's no enchantment there's no defination there's no power glory to God because we are a son of God now I'm I'm I'm I'm not saying be glad on us no sir I'm saying thank the Lord for what he has provided for you that's exactly right Hallelujah yes sir I'm not saying don't listen to the doctors you listen to the doctors the doctor will tell you stay away from white substance said what do you mean I've got so many white friends please explain to me he says no white substance like salt and sugar I said oh okay now I get it I said are you are you saying I'm taking cocaine says no I mean white substance processed like flour processed food I said okay okay doctor I I understand now amen Deuteronomy CH 32:30 sir now I'm going somewhere with my message sh your time now how should one chase a th000 and two put 10,000 to flight excellent you see the power of working together when I was a bachelor I was chasing a th000 when I got married now I'm chasing 10,000 Hallelujah yes sir if you are a bachelor you are chasing a thousand but you get married you chase 10,000 Hallelujah the power of working together yes sir the two shall put 10,000 to flight that's it except their rocket sold them and the Lord has shut them up and the Bible says for their rock is not is our Rock even our enemies themselves they are the judges it's not for you to tell people you know what I'm a Christian no this is me this the enemies themselves they are the judges my brother your neighbors are the judges your coakers are the judges they should say this brother is a Christian this sister is a Christian there's something different about this person it was not Daniel who was crying out in the Lion's Den and saying neaz please take me out it was the king who ran that's it says Daniel are you still alive that's it I knew your God was going to come down and save you amen the enemies are the churches of what God can do Hallelujah now praise be to God so now healing is part of the atonement amen we get into that because that's my my subject this morning healing is part of the atonement amen now we cannot preach salvation with without preaching healing amen amen amen because these two are connected together yes my brother although we don't emphasize healing but there's healing in the word always when we are preaching the first seal there's healing that's it when we preach the second seal there's healing when you PR the trumpets there's healing that's it you see now because without the correct teaching that's it some people always think well we'll wait for a day when we have a prayer meeting then I'll bring my request that's the problem no that's the big problem whenever the message is being preached amen there healing amen because healing is part of the atonement always you cannot preclude healing from the atonement it's impossible no sir am hallelujah amen amen amen the prophet says in contending for the faith sickness is an attribute of sin that's exactly now maybe you haven't sinned yourself personally uhhuh is is what causes you to be sick but it was because of sin in the first place right that brought sickness to the world that's right before we have ever had any sin we had no sickness that's exactly that's what the prophet says and he says now yes you cannot deal with sin in any way without dealing with uh uh sickness right without dealing with it says without dealing with sickness or every attribute that sin produced that's exactly right see when we deal with sin we deal with death right we deal with sickness is the first stage of death when sickness takes your body right so the prophet is saying now take your time now salvation wonderful is part it has got many attributes one of them is healing right salvation brings you healing yes sir salvation brings you Joy yes sir salvation brings you peace yes sir salvation brings you many many things yes my brother I may not come here and preach on peace but you know what by preaching the gospel you get Peace by preaching the gospel you don't get joy because you know what all these things they are contained in Salvation that's it and salvation comes from the atonement pre my brother Hallelujah preach my brother oh my pre my brother so when God brought our atonement that's it to atone is to reconcile amen you say now that's why you have an atony who represents you someone who stands for sure that's it so Jesus Christ was our atonement amen and if you go to Isaiah 53 it talks about many things uhuh he was wounded for our transgression that's right but his stripes were healed that's right he say now the chastisement of our peace yes sir so so peace came from his chastisement that's right from his tribes to get our healing right amen all these things that we read in Isaiah 53 they are attributes of the atonement that's exactly right it's not a separate Ministry no sir it's the same ministry that's exactly right take your time but you see people have taken this healing and theyve commercialized it to make money oh brother they have got some special healing power bring your seed who pray for you that is not scriptural amen if you a gospel preacher you are a healing preacher you are a joy preacher you're a peace preacher if you are a gospel preacher you are preaching the Good News of the Kingdom amen amen amen because you know what the devil will tell you oh your power is not gifted your pastor is not gifted to for your healing that's a lie that's the devil your power your pastor is enough power to pray for you just like any other minister amen amen amen amen amen because the gospel brings healing yes my brother take your time Hallelujah take your time I'm bringing healing cloth to sh it's not as far as you can think it's not somewhere far in a distance healing is right there with you right now yes my brother take your time oh my yes my brother you see that's why people run run after camps and different places I'll go to this place those things are fine but that is not faith that is not Faith because if you have faith you don't even need to go anywhere you say Lord I believe you right now I can be healed yes sir and if you believe God God acts upon your faith amen amen amen amen because you know what people they start to bind people around themselves right that's it right if you want to be healed you have to come to our church you have to come to our special meetings healing Services hallelujah oh we're going to have a healing Revival we have healing revivals every time when we come to church we are having a healing Revival right now there's a healing happening right now Hallelujah because you know what healing is in three stages right take your time now healing there's healing in the S that's the that this is where we spend 99% of our time take your time because if you are not healed in the soul what are you doing going to hell because if you are a son of God you can lose your mind and go to heaven that's a quot if you're a Son of God you can wear glasses like me and go to heaven so that's why we don't we don't we don't emphasize too much on the outside we focus here yes sir because that is where everything lays that's where start and the second healing is the healing of the spirit take your time demonology take your time he he right there he says demonology take your time I forgot to remind you to read your books read the tapes two scriptures a day Church ages somewhere somehow someone is [Applause] reading it's a scripture we have to tell you these things God commands ministers to say those things Hallelujah yes so this is this is in denimology right yes sir so we don't spend too much time on the body because you know what it's just the body that's right but still God is interested in your body that's exactly your religion cannot be just inside without affecting you outside your religion is to affect every part of your body amen amen amen that's why that's why you wear long skirts you can't just say I've got Jesus inside I don't have to worry about my dressing no sir the outside reveals the inside amen PR hallelujah what you are on the outside shows what's inside if you're empty inside you're empty outside take your time so now the the demons that a affect the body sugar diabetes blood pressure cancer I'm not going to write them here because I don't want to waste my ink but we know them PR they're not worthy of our ink I say they are not worthy of our ink they not worthy of our time we are not here to talk about demons we want to talk about Jesus we to Jesus why should we glorify sickness let's glorify Jesus I am a minister of the Gospel I talk about Jesus amen amen amen glory be to God yes sir so there are sicknesses that affect this part of the body and if you're a Christian they don't possess you they they they oppress you take your time there are demons that affect your spirit take your time depression anxiety uhh worry worry fear anxious those are demons that operate in the spiritual realm take your time when you are sitting in church you are wondering and you are Waring the prophet says it's like a white cloud that's it that gets all of you those things are demons and you know what there's healing this morning from those Spirits amen amen amen and the prophet tells us that we are living in a neurotic age that's exactly right so there is a big proliferate ation of demons in this realm that's it that's it that's it right yes sir and and and Paul says we want God I I pray that God will give us the power of a sound mind because these things they affect your mind that's exactly and your mind is where the battle is amen amen amen amen and some sometimes what happens in this body will have an impact of take your time what happens here take your time for example if you go through menopause take your time that spirit will also affect your mind that's exactly right take your time and you start saying things like I never loved you to your husband and if your husband is not well taught that's it he will fire for divorce pre my brother but if he's well taught preach my brother he knows that is just it's just the enemy playing around here that's exactly right take your time and if you are a son of God who is well taught preach I love you anywhere I love you anywhere even if you don't love me I love you anywhere brother even if you never loved me I love you anywhere when you do that you attacking these demons here that's exactly why and the next morning she'll say I am sorry honey uhhuh I did not mean to say that that's exactly right I don't know what came over me that's exactly in your heart you know what came over her that was the enemy amen amen so healing is not just physical because I've seen people that are healthy outside but here it is terrible here terrible they always wondering the prophet says wondering Stars wondering always wondering one time he says to a woman you you always Crossing Bridges before you get there oh what if my son doesn't come to the Lord now what if what if my husband cheat on me uhhuh where you going and you know what it takes joy out of you that's exactly right what what if I was not his first choice stay right there preach my brother stay right there preach what if what if what if he loses his job what are we going to do that's the power of the enemy that's exactly right in the realm of the spirit that's exactly and you should never underestimate the power of the of the enemy to deceive in the spirit that's exactly right and this morning there is healing in the name of Jesus God can set you free from those things uh God can heal you from those things I say wor live in the name of Jesus anxiety live in the name of Jesus there is a mental health crisis out there that's right not here uhhh here there's a sound mind amen a here there's healing there's joy there's peace amen amen amen hallelujah take your time it's called shalom shalom yes before the prophet left the SC he says Darkness shall cover the Earth and grow Darkness shall cover the people but to you the bride Shalom I say shalom shalom in your house shalom in your business shalom in your marriage shalom in your church I say shalom in the name of Jesus shalom in your mind shalom in your heart amen Shalom amen oh thank you Jesus glory to God woo take your time the prophet gave us Shalom amen we say oh brother the economy is collapsing Shalom oh the price is arising Shalom don't worry about those things you are a son of God God knows who to who to send to feed you amen amen amen amen you know who fed Elijah the cross the meanest Birds fed Elijah the meanest boss will feed you the me who F amen hallelujah because God commanded the ra yes my brother you say this will never happen in my company don't worry God will command that Raven to Feit you yes my brother God will command The Raven to Feit you yes my brother glory to God I don't know who the Raven is but God is going to command that R raaven to feed you amen and Elijah was eating three Square meals a day a good breakfast a good lunch and a good supper take your time Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah so so when I'm preaching about healing don't just get caral we are we are talking about everything amen we are talking about everything amen but the first healing has to be happened here this is what is a compulsory it's a must you are compelled you are you are completely compelled and commanded amen amen that's why the prophet says in the message what is the Holy Ghost says you are it's compulsory it's mandatory mandatory to receive the Holy Ghost amen amen because if you are not circumcised on the eighth day you are cut off from Israel exactly a commandment it's not a negotiation no it's not an option you must receive the Holy Ghost amen amen amen amen if you don't have the Holy Ghost you might have a gem of life which is another subject but you know what your soul is dark because you know what you have not it's not been quickened that's right but when that seed is quickened then you are alive amen but when you are alive here yes sir it does not mean you are free down here uhuh down here you have to fight for every inch that's exactly right you have to fight for every inch of the land yes my brother you have to fight for your healing yes you have to fight for your everything that God gives you you have to fight for it amen the prophet say salvation amen will last as far as your faith will last that's exactly right and he says your healing that's exactly right will last as far as your faith will last that's exactly right that's why there are people who are healed they go for four years after four years they get get sick and they die sometimes because they've lost their faith you have to hold on to your faith that's right you have to keep believing that's right I am healed in the name of Jesus I am healed in the name of Jesus am and you have to give the devil an eviction notice say get out of my property get out of my mind get out of my house get out of my marriage let's evict him this morning I say let's evict him this morning let's go the sheriff the Holy Ghost we say go out go out take and leave take your belongings talk everything am we are giving in an eviction notice amen amen amen amen if he does not want to go nicely we will hold him by the belt and we will Dr him out Dr him out to this morning I said take him out this morning amen amen amen amen he's saying oh you are hurting me keep taking me out brother Braham says I hear demons they are calling one to the other that's right they are calling one to the other but you know what the prophet says we are going to direct them out come out in the name of Jesus amen amen says House of Hell let loose amen hallelujah this message came with healing yes sir this message came with Deliverance yes sir this message came with power yes sir this message came with an angel yes sir it came with a pillar of fire yes sir it was not an intellectual message sir it was a message of power amen hallelujah glory to God brother says Tommy osor is my convert not to salvation but to Divine Healing you can be saved and you don't believe in healing and you need a conversion so the prophet says he is my convert to Divine Healing and this morning if you don't believe in Divine Healing be my convert amen God still heals I say God still heals amen you say oh brother Aaron we are in the third pool we don't need healing how do how was the SE of sister maida dissolved ah was it under the first first pool no was it under the second pool no it was under the third pool yes my brother there's healing in the first pool that's right there's healing in the second pool there's healing in the third pool when we are preaching the tret there's healing amen amen amen amen amen you cannot take healing from salvation it's part of the atonement that's exactly right it's not the main thing but it's there yes sir oh my glory to God lovely thank you Jesus yes my brother the prophet says Tommy Osborne one of the finest little men I ever met nearly Tommy Osborne he's a man after my own heart a convert to a convert to Divine Healing in my own meeting amen which stood there on that watched all the right thing in the Portland the Maniac Run at the platform you see the prophet is saying in the message Faith he's capturing the conversation that he had with Tommy Osborne he says do you do you think I have a gift of healing I want you to listen carefully take your time I said I forget I'll forget it brother Osborn I said there's no there there will be so much fanaticism tag to that after a while till that two evening that goes out has has to have the gift of healing I said look look you are a minister uhhuh so Tomy wasand s to brother Bram do I have the gift of healing take your time brother and the prophet says are you a minister ah and he said oh yes God called me to be a minister that's it I said that's right every every Minister every that's called is called to pray for the sick too that's it every Minister that's it Hallelujah brother brother Kell you are called to pray for the sick am brother po you are pray to call to pray for the sick if you are a minister because remember the parable of the Samaritan how many pennies was he given you are supposed to take you know the good Samar was supposed to to to to to take care of that man who was found on the Jero Road and he was given enough pennies to take care of that person and as a minister when you come in the ministry God gives you that Grace to preach salvation to bring to preach healing amen it's part of your credentials amen as a minister of the Gospel Hall amen and can I go a little further yes sir every believer is a promise every believer has a promise if you are a mother you have a right to lay hands on your child and you say Satan get of my child amen amen amen amen and send the Deacons the testimony I want to give you a testimony we prayed for our child and he is healed for your own information that's I there is Gifts of healing I understand that because a gift the says it's a measure of Grace that's what the Bible says of of course there are people who are given a greater measure just like the evangelism is a measure of Grace being a prophet is a measure of Grace being a teacher is a measure of Grace but healing is across the board Hallelujah yes sir the at amen we are trying to stabilize the church are we together amen so that people are not wondering I want to change church because you know what there's no healing in our church no there's healing in prop in the ministry amen amen numbers 21:9 and Moses made a Serpent of brass and put it upon a paw and it came to pass that if a serpent had beaten any man when he beeld The Serpent of brass he lived all they wanted had to do was to look at the Bren Serpent and Christ is our Bren serpent that's right how many knows that amen now Malachi 4: 2 and 3 take your time the Bible says but un you the previous verse it says that you know the the day of the Lord shall come that shall burn as an oven right right he's talking about the last day and but here in verse two and I like the scripture that says but you know God will say a lot of things but he say but it's a conjunction but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with what healing with what and you shall go forth and grow up as CES of the store amen oh my and you shall treay down the wicked right for there shall be ashes under the SS of your feet all the Hollywood that you see it's ashes that's exactly it's Canon F amen that I shall do this says the Lord of host amen now here the prophet now interpreting because remember a prophet is a Divine revealer of the word of God that's exactly right says to a glorious ring with Jesus for a thousand years of Shalom uhh when will it I don't know said it would be I don't know how he's going to do it but his spoken word will be a Vindicated when the son of righteousness shall rise with healing in his wings and he says and the healing part there there will not be a physical healing as you think go ahead my brother go ahead says this scripture is not a physical healing take your time it's a Rapture scripture PR my brother don't you like when the prophet changes your ah it says it's not as you think so in other words this healing let me finish the CT and we go back to go to the board says he says he says will be a physical healing as you think as saying somebody's got sickness and they'll be taken away from them that's what's going now in time that's right but the whole creature will be changed right so the sign of righteousness bringing healing the main event is the rapture amen because the Rapture is the healing of the body am it's the healing of all creation amen but the praying for the sick is a type of the of the of the actual healing amen so when we preach some of the deep things in the Bible we want you to focus on the main healing that's say that's it and it will take care because this healing is a tith amen it's a shadow amen it's a negative amen so we don't spend too much time on the negative because once you have the if you have the positive correct you automatically have the negative take your time we're correcting your thinking because you know what people can become so carried away oh brother I tell you God is moving in our church this happened this happen God is healing people every day yes P we may not be talking about it every day we may not give too much attention but God is heing people amen amen say oh brother we are preaching the trumpets again why don't you just talk about miracles there are Miracles when we are preaching the trumpets that's that's that's exactly right depending on how you looking it exactly yes sir a paradox look at the title Prophet says because healing is the children's bread amen amen and bread is daily but the Bible says give us this day our daily bread take your time so you don't go to town when you have ate bread ah you can't eat bread at home and start telling everyone H sister I'll tell you this morning I had bread uhhuh oh I had bread from Publix it was cute preacher because it's children if children's bread is something that you have to have amen if you come to brother Aron can I see you I said okay my sister tell me what is it I ate bread ah I ate bread this morning I said sister here is $10 buy two more Loaves and enjoy yourself we're not saying it's not there it's important yes sir but you cannot spend your day say friends I have to tell you I had bread Pastor I I should tell you I had bread we are not minimizing healing want you to know that it's so close to you it's just like Tong Paul says it's the least of the gifts am and the prophet says if you spend enough time in prayer you may speak in tongues that's exactly right so we cannot measure on a minor no hit the it's bread amen and today we are giving bread huh do you want whole itat receive it do you want sliced receive it we are giving bread this morning amen amen you say brother I don't have enough Faith even if you have a lunch box like a little boy bring it to Jesus that's it bring it to Jesus he will multiply that bread amen amen if you have enough Faith this morning as I'm preaching you can stand on your feet and claim your healing and you walk away healed am different from the way you came don't say I'm going to wait until the end of the service you are getting being healed right now brother Aon is going to call a prayer line no you can be healed now amen amen amen amen we have to teach these things yes my brother because you see the church was taking a sideway yes sir the prophet says we realize that it's in the atonement yes sir and the atonement first is applied to our souls that's oh my number one that's that this is the start yes sir this is the start but you see others want to start where others want to focus when way and that's a problem because you know what because the bo is not redeemed that's exact unfortunately that's right no matter how spiritual you are the body is not redeemed that's exactly right that's why we don't hug our sisters that's exactly right that is exact because we are immature no but we know that we still have red blood cells uhhuh uhhuh your cells could be green that's all right that's your problem but mine are red and they still work pray to my brother the prophet says you can't say I can hug a woman and don't feel anything something is wrong say something is wrong with you something is wrong something is if your body is correct correct you have to feel something amen amen that's what he say that's why we that's why we don't we don't be alone with a woman if I if I visit a brother I knock on the door his brother sayth around no he's not around God bless you my sister and you you move away that's it I'll come inside I'll have tea no no no no tea no tea no tea the Bible says flee from the very appearance of sinen the Bible says to walk circumspectly that's exactly right no why should you give someone a question we we had saying back home says someone SC don't drink water in a beer J so I know brother it's just water why can't you find a clean glass something that is not questionable oh brother it's a beer pot but I'm drinking water no no no no can you can't you find another container the B yes sir preach preach my brother preach walk circumspectly amen amen amen don't give other people questions standing block standing block why are you doing that standing block anyway let me take your time so the prophet says the first is the healing of the Soul right and then this the the healing comes down to these two parts of your body right amen amen and and the prophet says and healing is always forun every message amen so every Ministry has healing amen you cannot preach the gospel without preaching healing because healing is a bait Amen on the hook amen but if the fish is now out of the water why would you keep giving it worms huh preach preach the fish is in the freezer in the garage huh they need say I'm going to put a a a fishing line no no no the fish is all it's ready to eat Seas season that's why single sisters when you are dating you're going to have a lot of pizzas enjoy those enjoy those pizzas and free food because you know what it's a bait when you get married you say honey can you buy me pza the way you used to do I know we are budgeting for for for for for a house preach because the fish is now in the cooler box that's it that's why Solomon says the way of a man with a maid you ask ask sister Shambo when she was dating the great Revelation she was being given I'm telling you the way of a young man with a maid oh my in yes s oh when you are dating when you're asked to pray you pray like the high priest preach to impress to impress Lord God Almighty who dwells between the cherro beams when he gets married goes to sleep honey did you pray I'm tired watch the bait yes sir sisters don't fall for the bait look how he handles the word look how he handles the Worden watch where he lies down watch where boas lies down Hallelujah if he's lying down on Tik Tok all the time PR if he's lying down on Instagram all the time on WhatsApp if he's lying down on video games the whole day preach then he is not a redeemer because a redeemer must have three attributes preach now he must be willing he must be able and he must be a near Kings man amen he has to be an eagle he has to be an eagle you cannot be Redeemed by someone who is not a Kinsman preach my brother Hallelujah glory to God oh my glory to God in one in a million the prophet says I'm winding down friends sitting on this certain Rock there right there where he had appeared I had a friend that was with us that had come down from up in Minnesota his people was was here with this morning I'm not sure but what he was here here some of on the other floors it was it was do uh Donovan Vitz a fine young fellow a Lutheran that had just give his life to Christ and been filled with the Holy Ghost because that's the main thing the prophet whenever you would pray for people he would say are you a Christian amen amen that was the first the first thing amen he didn't say do you have a seed no sir says are you a Christian that's right and you say I'm not a Christian says if God heals you do you promise you're going to you're going to you're going to you're going to follow him you're going to give your life because friends healing is not something to magnify a minister or to get followings or to show off healing this is serious business my brother if you're not living right and you come here and you just think things will just magically happen you have a part to play you have to live right that's right you have to give your life to Christ that's right when you do when you do that then you come here we preach the gospel then you can be healed because there is no hindrance because the atonement has been applied that's it the token has been applied so Donovan he received the Holy Ghost yes sir what the prophet says and he was a young man uhhuh amen don't you ever think well I'll receive the Holy Ghost when I get old no dangerous the prophet says very humble German boy yes about 30 years old than two or three little children oh my I like this brother 30 years three little children already uhuh he's a he's an inspiration wonderful he moved down in Tucson just to be neighbors with me wonderful where three or 400 had moved to be neighbors and verse 32 paragraph 32 Prophet says and I'm glad to have such neighbors as that they follow me all the way from South Africa and everywhere around just to be near and be with me and be enjoy the pleasures of the Lord right now the prophet now says and I noticed Donavan on the right of his ear was swollen perhaps three times its size and looked very red with the Holy Ghost AM man amen you see that take your he was filled with the Holy Ghost but his ear was swollen take your you could assume that well he came to the Lord everything is going to be fine take your time no when you come to the Lord that's where the battle starts that's where your your mind becomes like the Gaza Strip that's it that's it when you receive the Holy Ghost that's it your mind becomes the Middle East that's exactly right preach my brother stay right it becomes like the donbas region glory to God but now thinking maybe that they they in the desert for a few days that way we had been that maybe he had got some cactus in his ear but taking a hold of his hand Propet sometimes would do this without telling you uh just hold your hand says I found out that it was a cancer so I say to Donovan I say Donovan how long have you had this on your ear just kind of to throw him off a little bit I didn't know how long has it been on there Donovan and he said brother Bram about six months he said I said why why didn't you mention it to me uhhuh he said oh s you are so busy said I didn't want to do it said I'm I just thought maybe sometime the Lord might tell you you you see he had a good attitude he cared about his salvation the main thing uhhuh I said do you realize what it is he said I have a good idea I said that's right and the second morning no more than that holding the boy by the hand the second morning there wasn't even a scar on his ear it was completely gone where is the prayer and the prophet says I didn't not even pray for where is the prayer because you know what the Bible says you shall lay hands on the sick I just touched his ear like that amen there was a quickening power in the hands of the prophet and the quickening power is here this morning amen you can get healing just by a touch amen amen amen even the bones of Elijah though he was dead that's it yet the bones of Elijah they resurrected a man who was dead that's right he himself was dead but his bones resurrected someone that's it you may be sick but you can pray for someone and they can get you amen it's a quickening power it's not for your benefit but it's for the benefit of the body glory to God but people say oh if he's the if he's the Messiah why why can't he serve himself from the cross it doesn't work like that elishah he had a stick he had nothing and he would ask the sh might woman what do you want he had no bank account he had never been to Bank of America he probably didn't even have a Social Security card but you would ask a woman what do you want you see the power of God is not for yourself it's for the glory of his name is for the glory of his name amen Paul when he was in prison he had nothing and he says whatever he owes put it in my account I will repay it because you know what he says though we are poor yet we are making many Rich amen so preaching the gospel is not based on what you have is based upon the promise don't look at the vessel look at the promise amen amen amen the prophet he was one time he was struggling to pay his tax tax you know but he would go and pray for people and then he goes home he struggling with his stomach because you know what he also had a cross to carry amen because there's a prize to be won but God does not give you the prize for nothing you have to carry the Crossen amen amen amen Elijah would say there's no Jew or rain that would fall unless at my word uhhuh and you look at the man Le the belt had hairs on him he had just $2 pants from the dollar store uhhuh and he would say a statement like that why because the Holy Ghost was in him amen don't look at your circumstances amen you are a son of God Amen what you pray matters before God what you say he matters before God you a son don't look at your yourself amen you have power to pray for someone in the church you that sister s and so is having an operation you go on your knees and pray that's it even if you are in a in a studio apartment you can pray and God can heal that sister that's exactly right you hear that this brother wants a job you go and pray for him that say don't say oh I'm nothing you are not nothing you are a son of God you have the you have the priesthood before God amen amen amen he would say when there was famine in Israel says there will be food in tomorrow this time there will be bread there will be people say how you are losing your mind how can you say that the prophet says now yes sir let's read Genesis chapter 15:6 and Bible says and he believed in the Lord and and he counted to him for righteousness that's right and he said unto him I'm the Lord that brought thee out of the of the Chans right to give thee this land to inherit it and he said Lord God whereby shall I know that I shall inherit and he said unto him take uh a haer of 3 years old and the she God of three years old and the ram of three years old the prophet tells us that you know the first two animals were were were females right a haer and a sheot right and then there was a ram right right all of these things represented Christ but you also see Christ in the church in the Old Testament and you also see Christ in the church in the New Testament Christ in the Jewish bride Christ in the Gentile bride that's right and he says and a to a turtle dove and a young pigeon yes sir and he took them all all these and he divided them in the midst and laid each one piece against another but the birds divided he not that's it William Maron Bram yes my brother now he's going to confirm the Covenant to Abraham yes sir this is Genesis 56 15 right and he said take a young Hyer now remember there's a female Cal take a she go of 3 years old each must be 3 years old right notice a three-year-old haer female 3 years old a goat a female a ram male right says each three years old and there is three of them she she two she the prophet says and a he right three-year-old clean sacrifices a lamb a haer three-year-old God and and then a ram and the prophet says and you notice everything there builds into a sign right and now we are supposed to preach dark we I'm not supposed to preach Doctrine from this platform here like today I'm visiting right and I'm sure that's close enough you can see notice it says now the two birds prophecy says one pigeon and a total Dove which are of the same family the P that talk about now he cut the goat the sheep in two he cut them RAM and the goat and others he divided them he cut them in half and lay them down but the doves and the pigeons he did not Divine amen there was of course anyone knows the scripture that Divine Healing see in both covenants amen amen oh my amen you see now Prophet says he split everything but the doves the young pons everyone knows that that that's the Bible that a dove was an offering for sickness God everything was split right but these two birds were not split that's right and the prophet says because there was Divine Healing in the Old Testament that's right and there was Divine Healing in the New Testament that's exactly right and the Divine Healing the the T dos and the pons they were part of the sacrifice right they were part of the atonement that's exactly right so salvation goes with healing that's exactly right you cannot have complete Ministry without healing friends amen that's what the Bible says right so when when you in the Old Testament there was healing now healing it was not cut one other reason is because even if you're a sinner you come on the prayer line you believe God can heal you the prophet says I've seen prostitutes coming on the prayer line getting healed and going back and I've seen God's children suffering amen that's exactly right amen it's a turtle do you were saved by the law then you are saved by grace now God split the H the sheep and so forth he split that open but the turtle does and pigeons he throw them in home showing that this never has God's covenant changed about healing he was the Healer in the Old Testament he's the Healer in the New Testament he's a Healer in the first pool he's a Healer in the second pool he's a Healer in the third pool and the priests they would administer the sacrifice the prophet talks about in the message if you read the message the wounded the the wings of a dove he talks about the purification of the of a child says they would bring dos is and the priest they were they were given instruction on performing this this sacrifice showing that a priest a minister is able to administer prayer for healing and if if if you had a breakout of fos whatever it was the Bible will command the priest to go and inspect that because if that's why James says if anyone is sick call the Elders that's a scripture but people want to do it vice versa when they are sick they want to sing the Bible says if you if you are married then sing if you if you are if you have got sin confess your sins if you are sick call the Elders but people when he is in sin he will post something on online when he's sick he wants to you got to place things in the word when you are mared sing when you are sick pray or call the Elders when there's something that is not right you go and make it right that's it that's it amen am I'm winding down the prophet the Bible says now and when they could not come nigh unto him for the Press they uncovered the roof where he was and when he had broken it up they laid down the bed wherein the Seck of the P lay when Jesus saw their faith he said unto the unto the Seck of the power son thy sins be forgiven thee so Jesus when he dealt with sin right he dealt with the sickness right because remember we said the prophet says sickness is an attribute of sin that's EXA so a preacher might come here he might not say you are healed but he's all is but that doesn't mean he's not preaching healing go ahead my because Jesus Christ he said Son your sins are forgiven that was enough saying that that was healing for the soul and the body yes Hallelujah do you see that friends amen I've got that Cote thank you so much amen and here in Psalms the Bible says bless the Lord all my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name bless the Lord all my soul and forget not all his benefits benefit yes sir you know people forget God's benefits for now God does not want you to forget his benefits take your time I have been working with you know retirement accounts you know for large companies and so on and one of the problems that the IRS has is people are not claiming their benefits and it's troubling the government right and God also it troubles him when his children are not accessing their benefits that's exactly and he's saying don't forget your benefits don't forget your benefits hallelujah amen don't forget your benefits my friends amen amen amen amen and companies they are compelled by law to tell people their benefits that's right Hey listen you can have a 400k account that's a benefit they have to tell you that there's a benefit and today is a minist of the Gospel I am telling you there's a benefit there's healing in the name of Jesus uh there's forgiveness in the name of Jesus uh don't forget his benefits ahen Hallelujah I always say that you should marry for character and beauty is just a benefit but you marry for what for character but there's nothing wrong with beauty if your wife must look very beautiful to you to you she must be the most beautiful person in the world so when you are married you are not after Beauty you are after character but character will come with benefits of beauty so we are not seeking natural blessings we are seeking the kingdom and his righteousness but the kingdom and righteousness comes with Benefits oh my you see you could be disproportionately blessed I'm using an illustration don't stay in the spiritual you could be earning 100,000 but your benefits are 200,000 you see now but if you don't access these benefits you're losing out a lot so these are the benefits there are benefits of getting married but that's not why we get married they are just benefits there's an ice cream in the fridge but you don't live on ice cream sir sir there's a dessert but you don't survive on desserts a so for you don't forget the benefits but also don't lose your mind over the benefits don't put all your ministry on the benefits stay on the main thing that's it and the benefit follow like the young men they they really will tell you the benefits Oh Sister when we get married I'll take you to Greece yes sir I'll take you to France they will give you a thousand benefits and fill too I am very sorry young people say sister I will take care of you I even wash your clothes whatever you want don't have to worry I'll do I'll clean the house for you and when the sister wants to access the benefits returned cherch insufficient funds for the benefit but this morning Jesus is sufficient fund he's able to Pi up every benefit that he promised when he promised Joy he's able to give you Joy when he promised peace he able to give you peace because he's the Prince of Peace I say he's the prince of Peace amen your application is always accepted amen amen amen amen when you when you ask Jesus the first thing that comes how many love those emails that start with congratulations I love that congratulations comma you need to receive one of those once in a while yes benefits friends yes my brother who is this marisc and he looked around on the audience until he found a little woman and told her about a blood issue and she kept she felt in her body that the blood issue had stopped is that right and he said thy faith saved thee and he say the Greek word they is soo which absolutely means saved physically and spiritual that you may have you know the the the healing of your soul spirit and body that's why Paul says that you may be kept whole until the coming of the Lord in your soul in your spirit in your body we want the church to prosper in all aspects amen we don't want people to be parking nice cars and they're living a rotten life no sir we want people to be living the correct life amen at the same time we don't want people to be very spiritual and back home things ah it's a it's a boxing ring we want all all the benefits we want a balanced Church yes my brother people who are eyeballs into debt they don't know how to they don't know stewardship they don't know how to manage their finances they they just living from paycheck to paycheck there are principles in the Bible that can teach you how to be a good Steward if you talk to your pastor nicely he will tell you I said he talk to him nicely if you ask me I'll will refer you to your pastor wherever I visit if you ask if you I don't normally give people my contact but if somebody finds it by somehow and you ask me a question I always refer you to your pastor I never answer a Bible question for someone who belongs to a church because that is not scriptural praise be to God and the prophet says a a year ago I was standing back there with Fred San who is here tonight believe my poor my son the Holy Spirit came came down I said Oscar you will find your ponies they'll be standing in snow he was he was an Indian boy he left the prophet says he lost his ponies months back months back I'm talking about months and how many know that beers they hunt wild ponies and they eat them right because beers Bears they eat different uh varieties depending on the seasons like when it's the time of the salmon run they'll go and eat salmon when it's time of you know sum before the fall they'll eat horses whatever they can find or even elk and and and and and and there lays the letter last week and I got it Friday coming here it's laying right there in the file brother Bram Oscar find his ponies in snow he says brother Bram pray that I may find my ponies the prophet prayed after months the ponies were found in snow there is Restoration in the word amen whatever you may have lost you will find there Amen brother EV lost his car brother Bram prayed and they found the car that's right the prophet says I saw in the vision even the line where the fuel isuh you find it with with a COR gaug of fuel yes sir enough for you to come back yes my brother the Holy Ghost knows what you want he knows where your children are he knows where your mate is he knows where the young man to marry you is he knows where the young sister that you need to is wait upon the Lord wait upon the Lord amen amen amen amen can I have five minutes yes sir of course amen looking unto Jesus it says but if I come like one of some brethren and say God gave me a gift of healing we still have them right you know what the gift of healing is Faith in healing that's exactly right see you just release your faith to pray for somebody that's a gift of healing every Minister should have it everybody see should have the gift of healing amen the power that heals you is on the inside of you amen the Holy Spirit you just have have it let your Works its way out amen amen now the prophet says it's just a build up pressure it's the age we are living in a neurotic age that's right where people don't know what to do they where they are going the doctors don't have an answer for it because it's the psychiatrics being doctored by the psychiatrist and that's the age that we are living in this is why we are preaching healing in the word amen because you know what people are losing their mind that's exactly right sometimes you may think someone is B when they have just lost their mind that's right they may be Christians but they can lose their mind for one reason or the other right remember that woman who was crawling on her back with that Spirit the prophet prayed for I think I think she had I can't remember correctly I think she went into Mina they gave her a shot and then she lost her mind that's exactly right a shot amen so we have to stay with the word because we are living in the neotic age amen amen I'm about to close here there was a woman who has in poverty and she was in poverty right she she had sickness things were so hard for her until she she approached the government she says I have got a problem please come help me yes and when she approached the government they they came to investigate right like the deacons when you bring your need they have to investigate that's exactly right that's the scriptural order that's exactly right you don't just come and say can I have 5,000 and we give you like that we investigate amen are you a widow uhhuh do you have children that are working at a scripture uhhuh so they did that say sister you're struggling do you have children uhhuh said yeah I have a child he's a businessman he's doing very well say so why are you struggling like this why are you why are you struggling you know you don't have enough food to eat why why doesn't he send you you know help why can't you ask him and she was a mother a true loving mother yes sir she says I don't want to bother him I can't say it go ahead my brother amen says I write him beautiful letters he writes to me the most beautiful letters that can be written to a mother and I just don't want to ask ask him remember Donovan says brother brother I was going to ask you that's exactly right that's the you should ask but you should not have an entitlement Spirit be humble before the Lord say Lord I don't deserve Lord I don't deserve the Lord but Lord according to your promise Lord please help me Lord I need this when you come humbly before the Lord don't give God aone released or like an IR boy oh Jesus I command you to do this this this this that is not the way to approach God no sir the way to approach God the Bible says I will enter his gates with Thanksgiving in my heart I will enter his courts with praise that's how you enter in the courts of the [Music] Lord yes my brother and says she WR he writes me beautiful letters uhhuh and he says can you show me those letters we want to see them so oh they are so beautiful he's in India says where are they and she took a Bible she opened the Bible she all these Bank drafts inside the Bible inside the Bible and the man from Social Security says oh you are rich this is a lot of money says I didn't know I was only reading the letters but you know what somebody had to tell him that's exactly that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday day today and forever that the days of Miracles are not passed the days of healing are not passed uh do you believe it this morning uh I say healing is here this morning H if you can accept you you can receive your healing you can have whatever you need it's there in your Bible it's there in the message it's there in the word uh God bless you this morning church uh please pray for me as I travel to Africa God bless you we love you and we appreciate you brother Steven the musicians you can come oh Hallelujah there is healing in the Bible there's healing in the message uh only believe only believe uh all things are possible I say all things are possible whatever you need this morning uh Jesus is here to take care of that need we are living in a time where there's so much sickness there's surgeries there's cancer but you know what the Lord will always raise a standard where where the law increased transgression incre and the Bible says Grace also increased there is Grace for healing this morning healing of your mind healing of your soul healing of your body whatever you need it's in the word uh will you accept it remember a Pon is not a Pon unless it is accepted don't get into a complex accept it it's for you this healing is for you it was paid for I don't have to give it to you I don't have to provide it to each already provided uh I'm only telling you what you already have uh healing is inside of you God will heal you this morning if you accept it I say God is touching you this morning you don't need a special minister or a special gift the word is enough the word is sufficient I say the word is sufficient God bless you Church amen amen amen amen wonderful the bible say that he sent his word and his word did what heal them amen everybody can pray for somebody amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah do you know there was a woman in brother bram's meeting and there was one a mother with a child that was sick you know that story right amen and God made it because if if that woman would ever come back and tell people nobody would have believed her because brother Bram didn't say anything so God made sure that she has to go through the prayer line with a baby to confirm the healing that a sister can pray for a baby and when the baby get to the Prophet The Prophet has nothing to do because God already healed the baby through the system we made these things so complicated when it's not complicated amen when the word is coming and this is part of the stuff is coming from the ministry because it's it's the way the message things were presented we presented to pray to preach and you wait all the way to the end then we begin to call the prayer line so everybody who's sick are sitting there waiting for the end when you can get healed while they're singing praises because when David was singing praises this is what was removing devil because healing actually is removing the devil so you don't even have to wait for this minister to stop preaching the word when they're singing you can be healed coming to church just getting into church into a certain atmosphere you can get your healing and when the word come if you can get one thing which is the word of God that say that word is a package amen that's why people don't understand they want us to put everything on uh on YouTube or on WhatsApp and say this one got H this one got here this one got here this one then everybody will say well God is working in that church we focus on the M thing and God is healing the family God is doing many moving along because that's not what we really F if you focus on the Rapture B BR I'm say the Rapture is a revelation and it's the Revelation that faith that bring you healing you might be down just talk to a sister and let that sister begin to lay on the word just for 20 30 minute with you before you know it's your spirit is changed it's a healing Jesus say your sins are forgiven and the people say who's this that can even forgive people's sin Jesus say okay so for you to know that the son of man has power to forgive sin rise up and walk in other words there is no difference between the healing over there and the Salvation they are both together if I can say your sins are forgiven automatically it's there it's under the atonement it is a combo we don't have to say the word healing you don't have to say the seven Thunders when you preaching the message correctly you preaching the Thunders when the tunders are coming they go there we don't have to repeat that word all the time so you understand that we are really preaching the Thunders no the Thunders were the Mysteries under the seals it's like people waiting when you say when the when Luke 17:30 that's when they say Amen no no when we're preaching the message that's Luke 17:30 that's Malachi 4 that's Revelation 107 Revelation 10:7 is an open book A book that was closed so we not preaching a closed Bible we preach an Open Bible That's the Bible that John swallowed John didn't swallow a closed Bible it was a Bible that has the seal broken so you can't preach a message that don't have the seals broken and every seal was broken so how can the seven seal not being revealed that's the book that he swallowed John swallow a book where the seals were broken and that's the book he prophesy so you can't prophesy without an open open book and when you prophesy with an open book autom medically healing will come that's why certain demon leaves you and you only realize after a while that hey where did this headache go because you were expecting headache in the name of Jesus Christ then you hear a demon moving you say okay now now headache is going you will feel you say Lord Jesus Christ heal me from this headache and you forget and you begin to do certain things and maybe after two hours you say wait a minute the headache was going you didn't realize that's that's the way he happened that's many things in your life look where you come from turn around then go see see yourself five years ago and then look at yourself today a lot of healing and God will continue to heal you amen amen everybody happy yeah people think we have to say God is healing you we can preach the trumpet and you receive the word and it takes the demon away or or for you to really pray good you need to go to medical school to know the name of the disease so you know how to approach God you don't need to go to medical school whatever it is it's a demon brother Bram say when you fighting with a bear don't cut his nail shoot him in the head and the head when you shoot in the head it takes care of everything when you see a tree go to the root cut the root don't worry when Jesus saw the tree he said Life come out when the life was taken out do you have to worry about the tree so just remember something happened to your life today don't worry about the tree where it's standing where the the leaves are still looking green don't worry about it just believe and hold on to your faith and before you know it it won't be you somebody may be like Peter will say look Jesus didn't even pay attention to that he knew the life was already gone let somebody say wait a minute she's walking that's what happened amen glory to God brother J good to see you this morning and the family God richly bless you it has been a while welcome to spoken word let's pray
