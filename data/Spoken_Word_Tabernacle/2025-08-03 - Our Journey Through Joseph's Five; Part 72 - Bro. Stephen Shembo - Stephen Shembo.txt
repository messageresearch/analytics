========================================

that doeth a son likewise. Father, a father workketh, and the son workketh hitherto. Is that right? &gt;&gt; He did not do a thing within himself until God showed him a vision of what was being done. &gt;&gt; That's his own word. St. John 5:19, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, the Son can do nothing in himself, but what he sees the Father doing, that doeth the Son likewise, and he'll show you greater things than this that you may marvel." In other words, that man healed with diabetic or prostrate trouble or whatever it was. Now, watch that one man. He had had a vision. Look at him. When when Lazarus died, when he told Lazarus going to die, he went away to the city. They sent for him, he went another day's journey. They sent you he went another day's journey and then one day he stopped when he know the vision is just about fulfilled and said well our friend Lazarus sleepeth and the disciples said he do well he said he's dead and for your sake I'm glad I wasn't there but I go wake him &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; what God had showed him what was going to take place &gt;&gt; showed him what was going to take place when Martha come and met him on the road coming. She said, "Yeah, I had been your Lord. Th my brother would have died. But even now, whatever you ask God, God will do it." &gt;&gt; See, Jesus knew that he was going to wake Lazarus for God had already showed him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he didn't do nothing but what the father showed him to do. Is that right? &gt;&gt; That's his own word. &gt;&gt; Well, if he's the same yesterday, today, and forever, he's working the same in his church today as he was yesterday, today, and forever. Is that right? &gt;&gt; He does what the father shows. &gt;&gt; All the prophets of old, some of them said, "Look at Elijah lived be nearly in his 80s, I guess." And he only done four miracles or eight, something like that. And all of his time he only done, one man said to me not long ago said, "Brother Brand, if that power was back on the earth, he would be just going through the hospitals raising everybody." I said, "It never did do it." Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "How about Elijah?" When he went up there and said, "Come up here and prove and I'll show you who's God." He said, "If we had that same God in the world today doing that said, God of Elijah would come down." I said, "Yes, if God Elijah told his prophets, so he would do the same thing." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Elijah done that upon you." I said, "No, he never." When he made his sacrifice and laid his stuff and order and everything like that, he stepped out there and said, "Lord, I've done all of this at your command. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your command, &gt;&gt; what you say do, Lord, &gt;&gt; that I'll do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then Jesus in this church today would be just as powerless as your faith is and just as powerful as your faith is. &gt;&gt; He'd be limited to whatever God would tell him to do that he could do. If Jesus was here tonight, he might stand before you or you stand before him, he'd tell you your life. He might what was going on. He might know what you telling them of a little lady that had a new Methodist church. the brother there was raised in Kentucky together and I was Baptist preacher and he was a Methodist and so he said Billy if you just come down have one night at a little little church down there he had a place down there and they had the people stand on the street said won't I ask you pray for a person and when it was sort of cool said Billy could could I take that back said I got one of my Sunday school teachers is sitting here said she's the middle case and said I've had such an awful time with her but said she's a lovely person. Said she's a divine step just lay hands on her. I did prayed for her. Couple weeks after that I met her again. She was the same shape. One day the Holy Spirit came into the room. I said to my wife, "Is she here now?" She said, "Can I call that woman from New Albony?" I said, "Call her up." When she come and sat there a little while, I spoke to her a little bit. I began to notice a little black car running like that. I said, "I see a little car running." was you ever in a car accident? She said, "No." I said, "But she was with a lightheaded man in an almost strange truck and she began to scream and talk her voice. She'd been going to a psychiatrist for 10 years." And there the Holy Spirit told her of how that when her husband was overseas, she lived untrue to her marriage vow and all that she had done like that. She said, "Well, Brother Brown, I confess that to God." I said, "You never sinned against God. You sinned against your husband. You'll have to go make that right with him first." And she said, "Oh, I" I said, "That's back in the Gabriel of your soul." And all they I said, "They could pour a gallon of oil on you and kick and stomp and cast out devils as much as they wanted to. It'll never be able to find a cure to you. Find the cause. &gt;&gt; You got to find the cause first, &gt;&gt; then you get the cure. What's wrong? Where's it at?" And she said, "I can't tell him that." He said, I said, "Well, you must." I said, "Doesn't he work for a Chevrolet company?" "Yes." "And there's a lady who works there was wearing a pink dress the other day. He was in a green Chevrolet car. He done the same act that you did." I said, "Go get him on the phone." I go out there and see if that isn't right. She called her husband and they confessed to one another. Come back up. The evil spirit left the [Music] I enter the hol. Holy of holy I enter through the blood of the lamb. I enter to worship you only. I enter to honor. I am. &gt;&gt; Let's sing that again as we enter. I enter the holy of holy. I enter the blood of the lamb. I enter to worship you holy. I to [Music] Lord I worship [Music] you. I worship you Lord. I worship you. I worship you. For your name is holy. Holy [Music] Lord, for your name is holy, holy, Lord. [Music] Lord, I worship you. [Music] I worship you, Lord. I worship you. I worship you for your name is holy, holy, hol for your name is holy. Holy Lord, for your name is holy, [Music] holy, Lord, [Music] for Your name is holy, holy, [Music] Lord. We thank you, Father. We thank you for being here this morning, Lord Jesus. We thank you for allowing us, Lord, to come in behind the veil once again, Lord God. And to sit in your presence, Lord, and to hear your word, Lord God, and just to feel, Lord, and acknowledge your presence is just so awesome, Lord God. We thank you, Father, for what you're doing, Lord God, in our lives, Lord God. Lord, help us not to be discouraged, Lord. Help us not to turn away from this word. Lord God, we understand at times, Lord, that you even send people in our lives, Lord, that may try to get us to come out of this, Lord God. It happened to Ruth, Lord, and it happened to Elisha, Lord. It even happened with the two prophets, Lord. But Lord, we want to just be so anchored in this word, Lord God, and what you're showing us that nothing, Lord, that Satan can do, Lord, and the devil can bring that will turn our way from us, Lord, to from you, Lord God. You are showing us who we are, Lord God. You have said in your word, Lord, that we are gods, Lord Jesus, and we are sons of God and daughters. So come have your will one more service, Lord God. Speak your precious word to us this morning, Lord God. Let nothing hinder that from coming forth, Lord God. It seems that we have quite a bit going on, Lord God, but we don't want it to deflect us, Lord, from our goal, Lord, of the rapture, Lord. Let it constantly be on our minds, Lord God. And let us serve you, Lord Jesus, like we're the only one going, Lord God. So come this morning, Lord, and bless our musicians, Lord Jesus. Bless our singers this morning, Lord God. Let us enter into that worship, Lord, in spirit and truth, Lord. Bless the congregation this morning, Lord, visible and not visible, Lord God. Give those traveling mercy that it may still be on the way, Lord. And touch those that are out this morning, Lord. Bless our technicians as well this morning, Lord God, that everything goes just right for you, Lord Jesus. And once again, Lord, bless our pastor, Lord, and the diligence, Lord, that he shows to to just receive from you, Lord, that he can bring it to us, Lord God. Bless that word, Lord. Let it be preeminent this morning, Lord, as we sing the songs of Zion this morning. Let us be happy, Lord. Let us be happy and rejoice in everything that you're doing, Lord. Even the things that we're not even aware of, Lord. Let us be happy, Lord. We give you every aspect of this service back to you, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name this morning. Amen. And amen. Can we give him a clap offering this morning? Amen. Turn around and greet your neighbor this morning as well. Amen. Praise God. [Music] You ask me why I'm happy and I'll just tell you why. Because my sins are gone. And when I meet the scoffers who ask me where they are, I say, "My sins are gone." Oh, they're underneath the blood on the cross of Calvary. As far removed as darkness from dawn in the sea of God's that's good enough for me. Praise God. My sins are gone. Was at the old time altar where God came in my heart and now my sins are gone. The Lord took full possession. The devil didn't. I'm glad my sins are gone. Guess they're underneath the blood on the cross of Calvary. As far removed as darkness from dawn in that sea of God's forgetfulness, that's good enough for me. Praise God. My sins are gone. When Satan comes to tempt me and tries to make me doubt, I'd say my sins are gone. You got me into trouble, but Jesus got me out. I'm glad my sins are gone. Yes, they're underneath the blood on the cross of Calvary. As far removed as darkness is from dawn. Oh, of God's forgetfulness. That's good enough for me. Praise God. My sins are nowusone [Music] of darkness. from [Music] God. &gt;&gt; Well, I heard an old story. [Music] How he gave his life on he [Music] victory. Dreamior Victory cry.

Everybody happy? &gt;&gt; Everybody happy? It's obvious we're missing a few people on the pews this morning, so that's that's part of my prayer request as well. Go ahead, my brother. &gt;&gt; I'll bless you all. Um, I'll try to make this short, but um, I had a rough school year last year, you know, hanging around the wrong group and, you know, just not making wise decisions and it comes to started to like affecting my grades and stuff like that. and I had a uh I had a low grade in a few classes, but coming towards the end of the school year, I was able to pull them up, but I also did have to take a um a math course over the summer just to be able to add another credit to what I already had. And we went to the school my father um I'm g say last week and we went there and the lady was like um oh you failed three of your classes English, math and some other class. And I told the I was like I don't have those classes. I was like you must have the wrong name or something. But I didn't say that cuz like you're the lady behind the computer. So then my father was like oh do you have the right name? That's when she checked over there and she was like oh I'm totally wrong. was like cuz I knew in my heart I was like there were classes that's but we went after she checked over she was like she had the wrong name and um that I was cuz the person that she had was going to be a ninth grader again I be a ninth grader again it's crazy but then she checked over then she and then she had said that um she had the wrong name and all my grades were finalized and I had passed and I was like I just want and after I just after hearing that and me and my fa just like a big size like oh just all you can say is thank you it was like but yeah I just want to thank the Lord for being able to um just bless me and also give me parents that are not here right now but for them for them to be able to just be wonderful parents and be able to know what's wrong and just bless all the parents here. I know y'all go through a lot and just want to say thank you for that. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise God. I told him he has some good testimonies. Amen. So, I'm we're real happy for that. I'm going to read the prayer the prayer request list here. So, y'all grab a hold of one or two and hold on to them as as I read them and then um we'll go to the Lord. Um first off, um pray for traveling mercy for the Ishiari family, I guess. um returning from somewhere. So I see almost all of you. Amen. There's brother Ben back there. So it's your dad, right? Is he Oh, they're going somewhere. Oh, we didn't say that. Okay. Well, good. Godspeed then. Amen. &gt;&gt; Your church's prayers will be with you on your trip. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, ma'am. I just wanted to say something. Uh I want to give thanks to God for John's giving him another healthy year of life. And uh may the Lord richly bless him. And I also want to make a comment. Uh yesterday we went to my son's uh house and uh to he wanted to cook a steak for his daddy on his birthday. And um just wanted to say something that I am very grateful to God for the youth that we have in here, you know, because uh some young man killed his aunt yesterday. He just shot her three times and and then he killed himself and he had been in prison eight years and just got out of prison three days before. So uh and a young man. So that I I was thinking I said that is so bad. You know, you go to prison for a year come and come out and the person that opens the door to you to help you, you shouldn't. But I just want to give thanks to God for the young people here because they have a desire in their heart to serve the Lord. And and as parents, we do try to do our best to raise them, right? And and we trust that the Lord will keep them as they grow into adulthood and for the Lord to continue to bless them. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. So, I've I've made a list here also of some other things. Uh, Sister D hit the choir group this morning with uh uh uh uh something about her vocal cords. Bless her heart. So, she's um not going to be able to sing with the choir for a while. And as of right now, our practice today has been cancelled um due to sever several things, but um so the devil's attacking her and her throat and her voice and it's going to be you said six months. So, we're going to pray for that. Amen. Um, Sister Zatt's not here this this week. She's going to be in uh Virginia helping a family member with something that was going on up there. So, we want to just ask God to take care of her while she's up there. Um, as I mentioned, Sister Lily needs a touch in her body. Brother Seth as well. I want to um bring up Sister Angela and her dad, the captain, again, uh, that we remember them. Um, I wanted to uh remember those that are still on the way this morning or out uh for whatever reason. Amen. It just affects all of us when um especially if there's any uncertainty. Um also, Brother Green's meetings are this week. So, let's keep those in prayer. And also for our building project, I just thought of these things that maybe, you know, we can keep on our heart as we go to the Lord this morning. Brother Michael Omar, could you come up and pray? Let's stand as well. Amen. Yes, ma'am. &gt;&gt; All right. I I wanted to I don't want to sound selfish if I keep it to myself, but let the Lord just exercise my faith, but the devil's been attacking me with migraines about 18 days straight. I go to sleep. I wake up with it. Light sensitivity, dizziness. Um, I'm scheduled for an MRI on Wednesday. They don't know what's triggered it. It could be the heat. Um, but we serve a faithful God and he hasn't left me yet. He hasn't failed me. So, as bad as it hurts, I could look at the symptoms or I could choose to keep my head up and that's what I'm doing. So y'all just keep me in prayer so I can come back and solidify and confirm my faith with nothing on the MRIs and say is wrong. God bless you all. &gt;&gt; I want to conquer with my sister John about the youths here. We really appreciate you. I can assure you are in the right place. You're the best of the best. I work I work in places where I see mental cases. Right now, majority are young people. So, you wonder what's going on. So, please thank God that you're in the right mind and you're doing the right thing. And the prophet said somewhere that seek the Holy Ghost while you are in your right mind. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Okay. While in your right mind so that when it he plays around with your head or your mind, you already have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Okay. Oh, let us pray. Help me to pray, please. Dear father in heaven, we come before you humbly. We love you, Father. We appreciate you. We thank you for all the things that you have done for us. Oh Lord, just to think that we are the bride this age, oh God, that takes away my breath, oh father, what a love is that that you can choose us among so many, oh father, that we are who we are because of you, oh father, and you purpose it to be so. We are going to make it because we have the message. We have a pastor that believes in it. We have a people that believes in the same message. Oh God. So together we gather together oh God to seek your face today. Lord Farmer come down father. Lord I want to thank you for the birthdays that have been given. How I thank for the life of brother John. He has been tremendous to us. Father adding him another year. Father, it reminds me of a friend at work that always when asking how are you today? Is there another day to serve him? So Lord, you given John another year to serve you, our father. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you for the mother of Sister D. Oh Lord, thank you for their life. I pray for the healing of our precious brother Seth and our sister. Oh God. Oh Lord, they are very instrumental. And there's a reason why the devil is trying to attack them. Lord, we refuse and come against the enemy that you'll give them help to serve you. Father, our sisters going for the MRI. Oh Lord, we claim the healing. Father, we let it come perfect. Oh father because healing comes from you because you said I sent my word and thy word healed them. Oh Lord come and heal us father. Lord the shares are preparing to for a trip father. May you cover them with your blood. Take care of them father until we meet again. And the many other needs that have been put across. I can't remember them oh lord but you are god who knows all things. Oh God, even the little things in our hearts, Father, we remember all of them. Oh Father, we give them all also to you, Father. Right now, Lord, I turn my page again to seek the face, your face for the sake of our pastor, Lord Jesus Christ. May you take him away, oh God, and may you use him for the purpose for your children. Oh father, you chose him for this work, Lord. Father, reveal yourself, Father. Take charge of all situation, Lord. And we know at the end of it, we shall be very, very happy. And we shall thank you, Father. Take the tithes and offerings and give them to you, Father. Let them be of use to our the gospel of the word of Jesus Christ as we pray all these things believing in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Y'all might be seated.

We're reading our Bible twice a day. One chapter in the morning, one chapter before you go to bed. We reading our cood book, our church ages. If you don't, somebody else is reading it. You find yourself behind. Amen. &gt;&gt; The 70 weeks, the seals, adoption or somebody is listening to the message of the hour. If you go through those uh books that I say and you finish them, you will see how much growth you will have in the Lord. &gt;&gt; This is the same path that we took it &gt;&gt; and you wonder why is brother Stephven knowing this and knowing this. We are not Catholics &gt;&gt; that the priest have a book that you don't have. &gt;&gt; It's the same book. It's just a matter of you investing yourself and making sure you can read what is in there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you give the volume to my friend here so he can say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Glenn, I'm still waiting on the next uh session for question and answer because we depend on the facility and the youngsman meeting. It's coming up this coming Saturday. This coming Saturday. It's the young men meeting part two for uh courtship. It's August the 9th and the married couple will follow on September the 20th for part 7 and December the 13th for part 8 in young sisters meeting will be on September the 27 and we will go with it on a question and answer uh format. Uh if I have time uh we'll see how we go. If we can cover all the question fine but if uh we run out of time that's okay. But if we have time, we will probably I will not touch that on the surface because we got everything recorded with married couple meeting. So you can uh once you get ready to get married, you're going to sit and watch part one all the way to part six. And then uh but uh God's willing, we will maybe touch up a little bit on what you're trying to get into. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because when we say marriage, usually we excited. &gt;&gt; Amen. We looking at huggies and uh kisses. Oh, &gt;&gt; you acting like what I'm saying is coming from another world. &gt;&gt; When uh usually when we say about hugging, we're looking at uh I mean marriage, it's about hugging. I'm going to have my own husband. I'm going to hug him. We going to have sex. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And all this type of stuff. But there is more to that into marriage. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Because when your focus is just there, &gt;&gt; then the devil will ambush you. &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together. &gt;&gt; The devil will ambush you. &gt;&gt; And then you're going to be very disappointed. &gt;&gt; After you kiss, the kisses become normal. &gt;&gt; After you hug, the hug become normal. &gt;&gt; At the beginning, it was electrical. Right. Electricity. &gt;&gt; You don't get me. Married couple knows what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; After a while, when you shake hand, it's like you shaking because you and your wife are one. &gt;&gt; The husband and the wife are one. &gt;&gt; So when you get married, you will find out that you truly are one. &gt;&gt; If you put your hand like this on your husband, you won't feel what you think you're going to be feeling. And then you begin to wonder. You say, "Well, what were they talking all about this marriage stuff?" Then the devil will ambush you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So marriage, brother Brandham say it's a responsibility. &gt;&gt; It's a big responsibility. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if we have time, young sister, once we finish your question, we will try to pass the infatuation a little bit. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. Yeah. They're married and the the the the what ceremony the picture on WhatsApp for a month and then people forget about you and we don't care about your pictures anymore and you put it yourself in your home &gt;&gt; and even if when we come to visit you we don't want to see them anymore &gt;&gt; we want to see the baby &gt;&gt; we want to see the children then life begin to change and take a different meaning amen so Lord's willing we will get into that so I will prepare your expectation a little bit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because young sister are like, "Uh, when is the day, Lord? When is the day?" And the brother, "When is the day?" No, no, no. Let me clean up that uh stuff a little bit. Let me open the curtain a little bit. &gt;&gt; I won't open too much. You you you need to get past uh uh engagement, then we give you all the video. Amen. But I will open up a little curtain like they did for brother Brham and you can begin to see a little bit what is there. You say, "Oh my God." So this is what marriage is all about. Then it will help you refocus and pray more sincerely. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Because you're going to deal with him or her the rest of your life. And if you made a bad decision because you didn't listen to your pastor, &gt;&gt; he's not going to die quickly. &gt;&gt; That that that wrong woman won't die quickly. That wrong husband doesn't die quickly. &gt;&gt; You will suffer. God will make sure you get it. &gt;&gt; Are we together? So I need to sit down and open a little curtain and let you see the curtain. So when you're praying, when you're talking to a young man, when you're talking to a young sister, make sure you using all the radar. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You remember the bubble of the Pepsi. Forget about all the Bubbles. Just when when when he approaches you, he say, "You look like my bubble in the Pepsi. Take that in the trash." &gt;&gt; Keep focused. &gt;&gt; I love you. You're the best woman in the entire world. In the trash. &gt;&gt; I'm not the best in the entire world. There are many other women. Go ahead and talk. I want to know what you have. &gt;&gt; I want to see your contract. &gt;&gt; What do you have on the paper? &gt;&gt; Because there are women there are women that more that are more beautiful than you. &gt;&gt; But he's trying to make you think that you more beautiful than everybody. &gt;&gt; You don't you don't want to deal with fact. Good luck. You're going to face it. &gt;&gt; Are we together? So whatever comes, oh you like the moon for me. When I see you, I can't sleep. Put daddy in the trash because when he will see you, he will begin to sleep and snore. &gt;&gt; Married people knows what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; So forget about put them in the tri focus. &gt;&gt; And if you a young sister, look for the head. &gt;&gt; Look for Christ in that man. &gt;&gt; If Christ is in there, that's it. &gt;&gt; That's right. If you a young brother, look for character. &gt;&gt; Not your character, but the character of Christ. &gt;&gt; So both the man and the woman are looking for Christ in each other. And if Christ is in the young man, Christ is in the young sister, it's going to be Christ marrying Christ. Then whatever situation will come in your life, God the trust in you will master it and correct it and focus and keep you blended together until we meet the Lord in the air. Any question, my friend. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you all this. I wish somebody told me all of this. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen, brother. &gt;&gt; We sat in the church for years and nobody's talking about marriage. &gt;&gt; Nobody. And before you know it, &gt;&gt; no no no preparation. You guys got preparation. &gt;&gt; You got preparation on finances, on sexuality, on this. We didn't get anything. &gt;&gt; We got nothing. &gt;&gt; But but but but an instinct is there to get married. &gt;&gt; We get married blind. &gt;&gt; Blind &gt;&gt; filled with all garbage from the world &gt;&gt; that the message have to clean up again. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you hear young people in the message, especially young couple, oh, nobody can tell you how to live with your wife. It's no no God there because they were natur &gt;&gt; because the pastor focus on one thing. &gt;&gt; A pastor is multitasking. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; It's a shepherd. &gt;&gt; Amen, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Pastor doesn't stop at the pulpit. &gt;&gt; Pastor goes, matter of fact, a pulpit even a preacher can preach. &gt;&gt; A pastor is beyond pulpit. &gt;&gt; The pastor is more invisible than the visible. &gt;&gt; His work is more invisible. &gt;&gt; In the hospital, in the question and answer, everywhere the pastor is there. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we made pastor like pulp it &gt;&gt; leave go home get a paycheck tithing &gt;&gt; and guess what very good &gt;&gt; free money I learn 20 preachers you sit down &gt;&gt; is that a pastorial &gt;&gt; no sir &gt;&gt; and before you know it the church is growing up without any balance &gt;&gt; for years &gt;&gt; because the pastor taught he's preaching and he goes home &gt;&gt; amen Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So that's young sisters meeting on this. If you do good, will you save my time? Amen. Because my time have not started. Young sisters meeting on September the 27. Amen. And then as far as uh uh the contribution link, so basically to the best that I get from the from the technician YouTube link is no longer uh alive for those that are following me online that have requested it. So the only way you have to do is copy the link and paste it to your own computer or your own cell phone. then the link will be active and you can make a contribution to the breeding project if you want to on other side we are investigating to see if we can put a PayPal online so at that point wherever you are you just deal with PayPal because we want to make make sure everything goes through the security of the United States so we're not liable for anything because I don't want any problem that my credit card was done this this you deal with PayPal and not me everybody okay so you give me some uh some week or something. As soon as we get everything for the security of the paper, we know it. But on a meanwhile, because there are people doing that internationally, you can use the link, just copy it on your computer or on your cell phone and you can use it if you want to give contribution. So I hope for the invisible audience I have answered your question. And once you see PayPal, you know everything is okay. Because we're trying to get PayPal for a nonprofit organization because if it's a a profit organization, then we got to pay fees. So, we need to go in a way where the fees are a little bit lower because we want to be good steward of God's money. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sister Sharon had to travel uh quickly. There's two ways uh two things that happened to the trip. Her father was not feeling good, but it's uh a little bit better by God's grace. And number two, I was invited to a big dedication back home. So there is a big church, a pastor. He actually was the one that introduced the message to my wife family. So he's a good a good pastor, a wonderful elder, big huge church. They finished the church. So they want me to be part of it to preach. But at this time the season is different for me. I cannot move. So she went to do two things. Handle the father situation and go into the business. So she's representing spoken word over there. So whatever she's doing, she's saying I'm representing spoken word. I'm representing spoken word. Amen. So Lord's willing, you pray for her because she need to she will be making up uh uh coming back this week. She had a rough time a little bit going back uh uh going straight and there was a delay uh get to the airport. Thank God we got a quick ticket quickly. But uh to everything there is a purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She get to parish for some reason her ticket cancel. &gt;&gt; And the confirmation was there. So we have to call the company. They say no we need to buy a ticket right there. So I have to get online and work quickly get another ticket quickly and send it. And she got the ticket but she had to stay at the airport to meet to get the second flight in the morning. So she stayed there for so long. And you say why is all of this? You remember Rof going to the land of Judah and now you begin to understand that all of that happened for a purpose. So while she was sitting at the airport, here come a Muslim lady walking straight and moving. No son or just a normal young lady moving and going around. And something told my wife that woman is pregnant and she's in pain. And she's in pain in that spot right there. And show her exactly the spot. And the woman keep looking at my wife. And my wife say, "Why are you looking at me?" You know, she say Sheron, "Why are you looking at me and smiling?" Amen. And the woman came straight to her. She say, "Something is telling me that you're in pain. You are pregnant." And nothing shows that the woman was pregnant. The woman said, "That's exactly correct. How do you know?" &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; he said something told me and the pain is happening here. And she said, "Yes, I came here for vacation. I can't even enjoy the vacation because of the pregnancy. So in other words, it was like something bad that happened to her. And my wife picked up from there and begin to admonish her of the blessing of having a child. And she called her husband. She said, "Come and listen to this." And everything was bullseye and chain. She even gave her the number. She said, "Let's stay in contact." And they even took a picture. So God stopped her for just one person. [Applause] Amen. So whatever is happening in your life, chill out. &gt;&gt; God knows what he's doing. &gt;&gt; It might not be for you, but it might be for something else or somebody else. And God is using you to be a blessing to someone else. &gt;&gt; Everything is working together for what? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So you ready for the word? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So let's stand for the reading of the word and flight attendant prepare for takeoff. The devil have fought us so much in this sermon right here. Amen. So you bear with me and we see how far we can go because every time I stop things continue to open up. Continue to open up. God bless you my sister there. I don't know the name but I see you. God bless you and welcome to Spoken Word Tabernacle. God bless you my sister right there. God bless you. [Applause] You're not a visitor. You're a family member. So here we say amen. We rejoice. We shout. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. My subject this morning is our life journey through Joseph 5 garment part 72. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I have a minister I believe in India. He's following roof. He's going one, two, three, four, five and he's using and and he even told me the missing part [Laughter] online. I was not even aware of. We need to try to figure the subject if we would try to get into it. It's taking advantage. This is the third time. Taking advantage. Now you already memorize of what &gt;&gt; season. &gt;&gt; The season. &gt;&gt; I hope we can catch into this but it's deep and it's really big and you need your scripture. So let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we approaching you humbly again this morning. Father, thanking you for your grace, your love, your mercy, and for everything you have been doing for us. Father, this is as far as we can go with the ability you have given to us. But when it comes to ministering your word, you only take the supernatural action of the Holy Spirit because man cannot divide properly your word. Only you God who is the author of the word can do it, Lord. Father, may you help the visible and invisible audience. May you strengthen us and remove every spirit of destruction. May we stay focused. May you come down in the power of resurrection and speak to our soul again. We commit everything unto thy hand Lord Father and we humbly ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to the book of Proverb chapter 6 because that's what we read last Sunday and we were unable to preach. We were only reading the holy scripture. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; If you dare, you can say amen. I &gt;&gt; was talking to folks yesterday, last night. I say make a habit, especially the young one, go back and relisten to the sermon. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And you will see how many things you miss yourself. &gt;&gt; Even myself, every time I preach, I have to go sit down and listen. And then I learn again more from just listening. Because what you're getting is two sermon in one. &gt;&gt; So if you think you're getting everything in one day, you're fooling yourself. &gt;&gt; That's right. And after seven months, you're going to ask me a question and I will tell you, go back over there and look at slide 25 and you're going to find it right there because you thought you got everything together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the Sunday sermon are two sermon in one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Proverb 6. Let me see if we will preach today. If you don't do good, that's your problem. &gt;&gt; Amen. Me, I don't have a problem. &gt;&gt; We don't. &gt;&gt; Amen. This stuff is more than 120 quotes that are sitting here that I have to deliver. &gt;&gt; So sermon are going with two quotes. Three quotes. Three. So when are we going to reach 100? So you need to loosen up and let's move. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Proverbs 6 verse uh six. If you there you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says this, that go to the end, you might be seated. &gt;&gt; You who? &gt;&gt; Slugger. &gt;&gt; You know what it means, right? &gt;&gt; If you were there, so you preach with me so we can get moving. Slagger means what? &gt;&gt; Lazy. &gt;&gt; Ah, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Go to the end. You lazy. Consider its ways and do what? &gt;&gt; Be wise. &gt;&gt; So one way to get wisdom is to do what? Look at the ant. &gt;&gt; So there is a wisdom that is connected to the ant. &gt;&gt; Or there is a wisdom that you only find at the end. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I don't care how big you are. &gt;&gt; You need to humble yourself &gt;&gt; to go down and see what an ant is doing. &gt;&gt; So ant are connected to wisdom. And last Sunday we we found that the Bible even said that they are exceedingly wise. &gt;&gt; You remember that? Anyway, I'm going to read it again. &gt;&gt; Exceedingly they are wise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, ants are connected to uh to a wisdom. &gt;&gt; Wisdom. Oh, glory to God. Some of these stuff, if I learned them earlier, I will be far away than where I am today. Amen. So in other words, young people, pay attention. &gt;&gt; He say, uh, go to the ant house. Amen. You slugger. Consider it ways and be what? &gt;&gt; Wise. &gt;&gt; What happened to the ant? Verse seven. Which have what? &gt;&gt; No guide. &gt;&gt; Are we together? And what? &gt;&gt; Overseer. &gt;&gt; Or what? &gt;&gt; Ruler. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says that the ant has no guide. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No overseer, no ruler. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why is the scripture so specific about uh ant not having a ruler? &gt;&gt; Amen. Because last Sunday we found out that no guide, no overseer, no ruler means that there is nobody there to control &gt;&gt; to push the ant &gt;&gt; to supervise. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; To inflict discipline. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's correct, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; On what the ant is doing. &gt;&gt; In other words, the ant appear physically to be an independent creature. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And yet the ant is wise. &gt;&gt; How can an independent creature be wise? &gt;&gt; That's good. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, the ant doesn't need somebody to be there &gt;&gt; for them to do work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Yes. &gt;&gt; Whether the person is there or the person is not there, &gt;&gt; the ant is fine. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Whether the supervisor is there, &gt;&gt; or whether the supervisor is not there, I'm putting that in our terminology so we understand whether the manager is there or the manager is not there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whether there is a camera, &gt;&gt; camera. &gt;&gt; Oh, there is no camera. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you tell the ant to to accomplish a specific task, the ant will do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the reason why Paul says this in the book of Philippian chapter 2:12. The Bible say that Paul say that wherefore my beloved as you have how &gt;&gt; always obeyed &gt;&gt; they are they are obeying when &gt;&gt; always &gt;&gt; sometime &gt;&gt; no &gt;&gt; this Christian be obey how many time? always &gt;&gt; always obey not as in my presence only. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; But now much more when &gt;&gt; in my absence &gt;&gt; Paul is Paul is praising these believers that they are not obeying Paul the messenger only when Paul is there. &gt;&gt; Because some people behave right when the pastor is around. &gt;&gt; Don't worry my friend. Some people behave good when the parents are around. &gt;&gt; If the parent are not around and the camera is not there, &gt;&gt; it's a disaster. &gt;&gt; So they must have the parent all the time &gt;&gt; in order for them to behave correctly. &gt;&gt; But the ant doesn't need it. And Paul is speaking about this believer and Paul is saying that these believer are more in tune when Paul is not even there. In other words, they are more in tune in the absence of the messenger. &gt;&gt; When the pastor is not there, when you are in school, &gt;&gt; when you are at your work, &gt;&gt; you behave more like a Christian than you do when you are in church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; If we want to see your Christianity is out there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Over here, there is an order already. But we want to see your Christianity at work, &gt;&gt; your Christianity on the highway, &gt;&gt; your Christianity at the restaurant, &gt;&gt; your Christianity in school where there is no parent, no one. &gt;&gt; That's when you need to show your colors. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you notice, that's how you can refocus. The Bible says that the ant has no guide. He has no overseer and no ruler. There is a reason why the scripture is pointing this out because almost every animal &gt;&gt; in the animal kingdom they have a ruler. &gt;&gt; Follow me carefully. &gt;&gt; Every in the if you go in a pride which is uh which is a group of a lion you will see there is a leader there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you go among the elephant you will see there is a leader. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you go among the crocodile they have a leader. Almost every kingdom, animal kingdom have a leader. &gt;&gt; But for some reason, the ant doesn't have a leader. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the way society, our structure, you have a ruler. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then you have the subject, &gt;&gt; correct? &gt;&gt; That are working together. Amen. But the problem, the ruler is supposed to be the head. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. But the scripture is saying that the ant has no head. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I hope we together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did you sleep well? &gt;&gt; The scripture is saying that the ant has no head. &gt;&gt; The ant has no ruler. The ant has no president. &gt;&gt; If we can put it to our terminology, he has no king. &gt;&gt; Even &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The ant doesn't need it. So how are they functioning? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Brother Brham says this when it comes to animal. Brother Brham says in the message God's provided way for this day. He says remember what do we remember? The education would not be the instrument to lead them to God's provided place. &gt;&gt; Talking about animal, brother Brham says that if you go to a pond &gt;&gt; where there is a lot of ducks, &gt;&gt; if you need the coach, you can see me. Brother Brandham said that when winter begin to come, &gt;&gt; do you follow me? &gt;&gt; Among the duck, &gt;&gt; follow me, my friend. &gt;&gt; There will be one of them, &gt;&gt; right? that when everybody is saying it's hot &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; that one is saying it's a little bit chilly &gt;&gt; are we together &gt;&gt; and then he appear as being odd &gt;&gt; yes brother &gt;&gt; among all the community &gt;&gt; it seems like he's saying things that everybody else doesn't feel &gt;&gt; I'm still reading the Bible my friend are we together &gt;&gt; then suddenly The duck understand. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham say he will &gt;&gt; honk. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said once he walk &gt;&gt; all the ducks &gt;&gt; do you follow me &gt;&gt; that are in that pond &gt;&gt; understand that this is the needed. &gt;&gt; Nobody did the vote. &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; No sir. because you don't want to take off. You need to be with me so we can leave the airport. &gt;&gt; Nobody need a vote, &gt;&gt; but they analyze the leader by the ability to see the future. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The ability to see past the present time. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And suddenly all of them will gather together around the duck, the chief duck. And brother Brandham say he would take off &gt;&gt; without a compass. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to land so we can go &gt;&gt; without an instrument. &gt;&gt; They don't need the weather man. &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say matter of fact &gt;&gt; those duck knows more than the weather man in the television. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; They don't need no instrument &gt;&gt; to tell them or to measure what is coming up. &gt;&gt; But for some reason, the leader will rise up. &gt;&gt; Do you follow me? &gt;&gt; And every single ant will follow the leader. And brother Brown saying it go straight to Louisiana. &gt;&gt; Never leave. &gt;&gt; Never miss. No GPS. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham saying when they go there, they land on the rice field. &gt;&gt; That's it. where there is again food. &gt;&gt; Who told &gt;&gt; the leader &gt;&gt; the direction of Louisiana? &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; who told the leader the specific spot &gt;&gt; where rice is in Louisiana? &gt;&gt; And brother say all of them were born right there. &gt;&gt; They never even been in Louisiana before. &gt;&gt; But when the time come &gt;&gt; when the leader begin to seize the season, Instead of bickering and fussing together, brother Brandham said they have a meeting in the pond &gt;&gt; and suddenly the leader take off &gt;&gt; and every duck begin to follow him &gt;&gt; all the way to the destination. What is in the duck? &gt;&gt; Who is directing the duck? &gt;&gt; Are we together? So remember the duck have a leader &gt;&gt; and they are following the leader &gt;&gt; but the ant are more sitting wise &gt;&gt; they don't have a leader &gt;&gt; I'm going somewhere [Applause] &gt;&gt; I am going somewhere &gt;&gt; the lion have a leader &gt;&gt; the goat have a leader &gt;&gt; but the ant don't have a leader and yet they behave differently sir &gt;&gt; what are you trying to say brother Even &gt;&gt; we're still at the airport. I'm waiting for the next flight so I can take off. Okay, my friend. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say this is why brother Braham say remember the education will not be the instrument to lead them. &gt;&gt; They don't need to go to college. &gt;&gt; They don't need no degree. They don't even need elementary school. &gt;&gt; They are depending on something that is leading them. What is that something brother Brown? I'm saying the instrument they have is what? &gt;&gt; Instinct. &gt;&gt; There it is. There it is. Amen. &gt;&gt; So in the duck when a duck is born, God take a GPS. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you if you preach with me, we move on. &gt;&gt; Remember animal have no souls. &gt;&gt; We already went through that. &gt;&gt; Soul is only found in human beings. That's why the Bible say in the ark of Noah only eight soul &gt;&gt; were saved but the animal were there &gt;&gt; because animal don't have soul. &gt;&gt; So because animal don't have soul &gt;&gt; God gave them instinct. &gt;&gt; Are you are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So if this is animal right here oh this is the ant. Whichever one you want to put in inside the end there is something there that God put and that thing is called instinct. &gt;&gt; Follow me my friend. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said this instinct here is the instrument &gt;&gt; that God he gave the duck. &gt;&gt; Yes. or the goat or whichever because brotherham say even in England uh in India when the earthquake was coming up only human being died &gt;&gt; amen brother say no animal dies &gt;&gt; for some reason they noticed before the earthquake all the goat were running away from the wall &gt;&gt; and the human being are still going to sleep inside the wall &gt;&gt; so who is that Amen. &gt;&gt; Who sin in the Garden of &gt;&gt; Eden? &gt;&gt; It is man, not the animal. Are we together? &gt;&gt; So man has a problem with connection to the leader. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when the earthquake happened, no bird, all of them ran away. &gt;&gt; Everybody was safe because of what? Because they are using the instinct. Amen. &gt;&gt; We clear now. &gt;&gt; We clear now. &gt;&gt; So ant also &gt;&gt; has instinct. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; We clear. &gt;&gt; But the problem they don't have no president. &gt;&gt; The duck have a president. The zebra have a president. The buck have a president. The elk have a president. But the ant does have no president. What does he mean? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The duck. Follow me my friend. God gave them the instinct brother said and they them ducks know that that instinct would take them to water. &gt;&gt; God's provided a place. &gt;&gt; So in other word God who is in the universe &gt;&gt; in nature operate through the instinct. Do you follow me? &gt;&gt; Of the leader. &gt;&gt; Yes. Right. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Then the leader goes to the followers. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Do you follow me? &gt;&gt; I'm in a surgery my friend. We got followers or we got subject &gt;&gt; or we got disciple whatever you want to call it. So the followers are looking to the leader. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the leader have an instinct. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Just as the follower also have an instinct. &gt;&gt; Do you follow me? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So between the followers &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Are we together? and God. There is somebody in between. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Have I lost you? If I lost you, raise your hand. &gt;&gt; Okay. Two up there. &gt;&gt; Let me start it again, my friend. &gt;&gt; I'm going to start it again. Whoever was shy, you also included. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; God gave animal instinct &gt;&gt; because they don't have soul. &gt;&gt; If not, the animal will not know how to live. &gt;&gt; So God must protect and get into nature to be a good and a just God. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; But in most of the animal kingdom, all of them have a leader. &gt;&gt; So regardless of how much you have an instinct, you still need a leader. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; So God will work with the instinct of the leader. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you follow me? &gt;&gt; And then the followers will follow the leader to safety. &gt;&gt; Because brotherham say some of the duck didn't want to follow the leader &gt;&gt; and they took their own path and they ended up in England &gt;&gt; and they didn't know how to come back and they all die over there. So it's important to follow the leader that is following God. [Applause] Did you get me? It is important to follow the leader &gt;&gt; that is following God. &gt;&gt; Refocus the camera on me. It is important to follow the leader that is following God. &gt;&gt; Because now we know that it's not me, it's not him, &gt;&gt; but it is over there. That's why Paul say follow me &gt;&gt; as I follow. Follow brother as he follow &gt;&gt; that's why he said I preach like Paul [Applause] &gt;&gt; we not following the man William Brham we are following the Jesus &gt;&gt; that brother Brham pointed to us brother Brham came to show us Jesus Christ and we are following Jesus Christ through his messenger That's why we love him. &gt;&gt; That's why we adore him. That's why we understand that he is God. &gt;&gt; Jesus was God in human flesh. &gt;&gt; Who told me that? Brother, &gt;&gt; we're not worshiping brother. We worship Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My two friend in the back, are we clear, my friend? &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; We clear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was one angle. Let me refocus the angle. &gt;&gt; And now we going to take off, my friend. We good? &gt;&gt; We good? &gt;&gt; So, we got God &gt;&gt; who's dealing with the leader. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's dealing with the leader and the leader are dealing with followers. &gt;&gt; So, the chain of command come from God. Follow me my friend &gt;&gt; to the leader &gt;&gt; and the leader to the followers. &gt;&gt; If you are with a wrong leader &gt;&gt; if you are with a wrong pastor &gt;&gt; you answer yourself. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So God the leader and the follower. But the end, &gt;&gt; do you follow me? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Does have a leader. &gt;&gt; Yet the end also have instinct. &gt;&gt; And God say, I want you to go to the end. &gt;&gt; My God. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope now we together. &gt;&gt; God doesn't want you to go &gt;&gt; where somebody has a person in between. &gt;&gt; Take your time, brother. I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; In other words, between the followers and God, there is a direct line. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; A direct connection &gt;&gt; without a leader. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; In other word, in the in the kingdom of the earth, God deal with every end. individually. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; How can you brother? I tell brother Robert, I say, I don't know how I'm going to move with this subject. He said, brother Steven, you cannot walk on diamond and leave them there. &gt;&gt; You You have to continue picking them up. &gt;&gt; So that's what we doing, my friend. Amen. So in this kingdom in the end God deal directly with the followers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every ant has a direct &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; connection &gt;&gt; with the maker. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Every instinct. &gt;&gt; Oh glory to God. &gt;&gt; is wired &gt;&gt; with a Wi-Fi. In other word, in the earth kingdom, everybody have a Wi-Fi device. &gt;&gt; When God is speaking, all the entire understanding. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you get what I'm saying. Who doesn't have a computer here? Who doesn't have a computer here? &gt;&gt; All of you knows what a computer is. &gt;&gt; Your laptop, we used to use a a hook that you put on the wall. &gt;&gt; Now with your iPad, what do we have? Wi-Fi. If you put a password, Amen. Once your password enter, you are baptized into Christ. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; Without password, you don't enter in the kingdom. &gt;&gt; You enter in the kingdom by the password, which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Once you have it, you are baptized into Christ. And once you you are connect once you get closer if your Wi-Fi is connected to this church as soon as your car is on the parking lot &gt;&gt; the Wi-Fi is connected &gt;&gt; in other words whatever happen is moving and every earth has a Wi-Fi &gt;&gt; connected to the creator &gt;&gt; the Wi-Fi device their instinct &gt;&gt; do you follow on me is completely connected to the maker. In add &gt;&gt; a community without leader, &gt;&gt; without rulers, &gt;&gt; without king, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to see people who have a direct connection &gt;&gt; with me. &gt;&gt; They don't have a connection with somebody in between. The connection is directly between God &gt;&gt; and the creature. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says this, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "Not for one moment. &gt;&gt; Not one &gt;&gt; do I bring a what? &gt;&gt; A message to the people &gt;&gt; that they may do what? &gt;&gt; Follow me &gt;&gt; or what? &gt;&gt; Join my church &gt;&gt; or what? &gt;&gt; Start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that &gt;&gt; and &gt;&gt; will not do that now. &gt;&gt; I have only what? &gt;&gt; No interest in those things. &gt;&gt; But I do have an interest in the things of God and what &gt;&gt; people. &gt;&gt; And if I can accomplish how many things? &gt;&gt; Just one thing. &gt;&gt; I will be how? &gt;&gt; Satisfied. &gt;&gt; What is that one thing? That one thing is to see establish what? &gt;&gt; A true spiritual relationship between &gt;&gt; between who? &gt;&gt; God and man. &gt;&gt; Between God and the earth. between God and the earth. What I want to accomplish in this church is for you to have a relationship with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You following the messenger and the messenger is taking you to Christ. There was a time that Rebecca &gt;&gt; have to follow Eli. &gt;&gt; But there was a time that Rebecca saw Isaac. &gt;&gt; Elz must move &gt;&gt; and Rebecca must be united with Isaac. &gt;&gt; Now the relationship is between Isaac and Rebecca. There is a time we were going following William Brham, but he pointed us to Jesus Christ. Now the time has come for you to be connected to Jesus. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Young people look [Applause] &gt;&gt; young people look your connection to Christ not your connection to me to Jesus Christ. [Applause] Because when you are connected to him, the Lord is my shepherd. &gt;&gt; Not the pastor. The Lord is my shepherd. In school, he will guide you. In Walmart, he guide you everywhere. He will guide you. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go to the ant community &gt;&gt; and go learn from the ant. What do you learn? A people, a community that have a direct contact with the maker without somebody in between &gt;&gt; without a priest in between. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In other words, if the priest die, the end is fine. &gt;&gt; If the pastor leave the message, &gt;&gt; I'm fine. That's the pastor problem. I was not connected to the pastor. I was connected to the message and the message is Christ. &gt;&gt; You leave the message, you go yourself. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Who brought you to this church? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Who brought you to this church? &gt;&gt; Your parent, &gt;&gt; you will leave one day. &gt;&gt; Your friend, you will leave one day. But if it's Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; you leave that your problem. Me, I'm staying because I know who brought me here. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, [Applause] &gt;&gt; are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Go to the ant. I'm reading the Bible. &gt;&gt; We just took off from the airport, but I'm still reading the Bible. Go to the ant. &gt;&gt; Go to the ant. Watch the end. &gt;&gt; What is God trying to say? &gt;&gt; No ruler. Last Sunday we were on the on the surface. Now God is digging us deeper. That is not just not having control but it also telling you that the ant is a community that have a direct contact. &gt;&gt; The instant the device is connected to the Wi-Fi. &gt;&gt; The device is not connected to the central then to the Wi-Fi. Because if a disconnection happen, we got trouble. &gt;&gt; My wife is overseas in Africa. &gt;&gt; But T-Mobile is working in Africa. &gt;&gt; She doesn't need the Wi-Fi over there. The Wi-Fi is still working, but T-Mobile is here. God might not be closer to you. &gt;&gt; But the Wi-Fi is there. And wherever you going, he's there. The Wi-Fi is connected. &gt;&gt; That's why David said, "Don't walk in the valley." Still the Wi-Fi is connected. [Applause] Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Brother, brother, I'm say if I want to see one thing to be accomplished, what do you want to see? You want to see establish what? &gt;&gt; A true spiritual relationship &gt;&gt; between what? &gt;&gt; God and man &gt;&gt; wherein men become what? &gt;&gt; New creations in Christ. &gt;&gt; How? &gt;&gt; Filled with his spirit &gt;&gt; and live according to what? &gt;&gt; His word. &gt;&gt; So, brother Brandham want to connect the people to Jesus Christ. That's it. &gt;&gt; Then you living like an ant. &gt;&gt; Then you become wise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, &gt;&gt; the wisdom of an ant is coming from God. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? The wisdom of an ant that wisdom is not an animal wisdom sir. &gt;&gt; It is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what it is &gt;&gt; that is maneuvering with the ant &gt;&gt; and the ant is only reflecting because God is in nature. &gt;&gt; It is not a wisdom of an ant. It is God wisdom reflected in the ant. &gt;&gt; That's why God is talking to human being. Go see my wisdom. how it's working in the end. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Brother Stephen, I don't have wisdom. &gt;&gt; You don't have wisdom. &gt;&gt; You don't have wisdom. The Bible says this, what? If any of you lack what? &gt;&gt; Wisdom. &gt;&gt; Let him do what? &gt;&gt; Ask of God. How? &gt;&gt; That giveth to all men liberally. &gt;&gt; He give how? &gt;&gt; Liberally. &gt;&gt; God give how? &gt;&gt; Liberally. &gt;&gt; Liberally and what? &gt;&gt; Breadth not. &gt;&gt; And it shall be what? &gt;&gt; Given him. &gt;&gt; In other words, ask God and it shall be what? &gt;&gt; Given to you. &gt;&gt; And what is that wisdom? The Bible say, but unto them which are called both what? &gt;&gt; Jews. &gt;&gt; And Greek Christ the water &gt;&gt; power of God. &gt;&gt; And the what? &gt;&gt; The wisdom of God. &gt;&gt; So the wisdom of God is who? &gt;&gt; Christ. Any question my friend in Corinthian 1:30 this Bible say but of of him are ye where &gt;&gt; in Christ Jesus &gt;&gt; who of God is made unto who &gt;&gt; as wisdom &gt;&gt; he's made unto as what &gt;&gt; wisdom &gt;&gt; so who is your wisdom &gt;&gt; Christ &gt;&gt; you don't have wisdom &gt;&gt; because you're not in connection &gt;&gt; there is there is &gt;&gt; if I don't preach anything that's fine &gt;&gt; you don't have wisdom because you're not in connection But if you are connected then you are connected to the supreme wisdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the wisdom of God will guide you. How can God guard an animal &gt;&gt; and doesn't guide you? [Applause] &gt;&gt; How can God guide an ant that you step on &gt;&gt; and the ant was not created in the image of God? But you and me, we were created in the &gt;&gt; imagine what? &gt;&gt; Like this. &gt;&gt; In other words, you were created like God. &gt;&gt; How can God lead you? &gt;&gt; So the problem is not God. The problem is us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Young man, listen. Listen. Listen. Follow. Follow. Young sister. Seek that connection. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? &gt;&gt; So to the animal God gave them instinct &gt;&gt; and to us God is giving us the spirit and God say go to the end and go learn something. &gt;&gt; They don't have no root. They don't have somebody in between. They are in direct contact with me. That's why they are synchronizing with nature because I am in nature. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says this my friend. He said God gave an animal what? instinct &gt;&gt; to do what? &gt;&gt; Take care of himself. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; And he gave the man what? &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; to do what? &gt;&gt; Take care of him. &gt;&gt; But animal believe his instant. &gt;&gt; That's it, Lord. &gt;&gt; That's it, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm I'm letting that soak. Whoever is distracting you, &gt;&gt; forget about it. &gt;&gt; If it's your person beside you, move away from him. &gt;&gt; Focus here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Because the devil has been fighting since we started this service. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Animal believe the instinct. &gt;&gt; An animal is believing. &gt;&gt; An animal without soul. &gt;&gt; When God give him something, the animal believe it. &gt;&gt; Are we together? He said, but animal does what? &gt;&gt; Believes his instinct. &gt;&gt; And many is scared to trust the Holy Ghost. Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Take your time right there brother. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; He said man is scared to do what? &gt;&gt; Trust the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That is what &gt;&gt; exactly right. &gt;&gt; Our arm and said what we need tonight is our arm and say what do you want to say? &gt;&gt; Lord God &gt;&gt; I believe what &gt;&gt; every word you wrote is the truth &gt;&gt; and I will stand by it. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; Live or die. It is your holy spirit that is doing what? &gt;&gt; Then we are going to get somewhere. &gt;&gt; You want to get somewhere? Believe the holy ghost. Holy &gt;&gt; ghost. &gt;&gt; Believe the word that has been written. &gt;&gt; Believe things that are written in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Animal have their belief. &gt;&gt; They took you, they give you yours. You have a problem believing it. Animal don't reason. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; They believe and they move on. &gt;&gt; You won't see a bird standing there and say, &gt;&gt; "Am I going to fly or not?" &gt;&gt; The bird just take off. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Brother Brandham said the trouble of it is with men. He don't know his leader. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. They shall do what? &gt;&gt; Rally around the denomination. &gt;&gt; They shall rally around what? &gt;&gt; A bishop &gt;&gt; or what? &gt;&gt; A man. &gt;&gt; But they don't want to rally around who? &gt;&gt; The leader. &gt;&gt; Who's the leader? &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Where? &gt;&gt; In the word. &gt;&gt; Holy power. &gt;&gt; That's powerful. &gt;&gt; The leader is what? The Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit where &gt;&gt; is the word. &gt;&gt; So the anointed word. &gt;&gt; The anointed word &gt;&gt; is your leader. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Some of you are quiet. I don't know what's wrong with you. The Bible says, &gt;&gt; the Bible say the leather killers. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Everybody's reading this &gt;&gt; but they don't know. But when the spirit come &gt;&gt; and anoint the word and begin to move on, &gt;&gt; that is the direction, the anointed word of the hour. [Applause] message believer. &gt;&gt; What is leading you? &gt;&gt; What is leading you? &gt;&gt; What is leading message believer? &gt;&gt; You got a court, &gt;&gt; but do you have the spirit of the court? &gt;&gt; The spirit that will quicken the court &gt;&gt; and make the court alive. &gt;&gt; Now he become a fresh word. Glory, glory, glory, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's amazing &gt;&gt; the choices people are doing. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's amazing the choices people are doing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Who is your leader? &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about me. &gt;&gt; Because even myself, I'm mandated leader. &gt;&gt; And that leader must be the anointed one. In other words, when we come here, we don't want to hear from men. &gt;&gt; We are hearing from God. &gt;&gt; A God that can speak through my pastor. &gt;&gt; And I will say the pastor don't know anything about this. &gt;&gt; This is something that myself know. &gt;&gt; This happened. This is a conversation I was having with my wife, with my brother. The pastor was not there. How did the pastor know? It is not the pastor. It is the anointed word. [Music] &gt;&gt; When the anointed word is coming, &gt;&gt; it is God. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what &gt;&gt; I am only a vessel. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A pastor is an officer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How can I say something this morning that you know I was not yesterday with you &gt;&gt; and then you sit around you say well where where well where well where well where well where well where well where well where well where well where well where well where well where well where well where well where well where well where well where well where well where it's not well the leader is talking to you [Applause] if you know something that I was not there. &gt;&gt; So this sermon belong to me so I need to pay more attention. What else does God want me to heal today for my life? [Music] &gt;&gt; Because God is already talking. &gt;&gt; You get to church and you are distracted and things happen. Hey my friend, &gt;&gt; let me let me ask you something. If you die today &gt;&gt; and we bury you, &gt;&gt; who's going to take care of your bank account? &gt;&gt; Will will your family be buried with you? &gt;&gt; No. They will leave you. And matter of fact, if they keep you too too long, you begin to stink. &gt;&gt; So, we don't want you anymore. &gt;&gt; In a in a in a in a clean way, we put you in a good casket to take care of you quickly. In other words, &gt;&gt; if you die, the world will continue to go. So when you get to church, whichever emergencies, turn yourself on off. &gt;&gt; They will find solution. I need to listen to my maker. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Sometime we are acting up like if we are not there people will die. No. &gt;&gt; You must know how to turn yourself on asleep. Whatever happened in the night, call the police. &gt;&gt; I cannot be standing 24 hours waiting for problem to solve. &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; If you die when we go to the rapture, the world will continue for three and a half years. &gt;&gt; You won't be there. &gt;&gt; So run out. Leave everything away. Focus to your maker. [Applause] Are we together? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say the leader is who? &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Their &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit where &gt;&gt; in the word. &gt;&gt; See, they say, "Oh, well, I'm afraid I shall get a little water &gt;&gt; fanatically. &gt;&gt; I'm afraid I shall get off on the water." &gt;&gt; Wrong foot. &gt;&gt; People in this message are even a scare of the action of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Let me even put it clearly. They are ashamed. They want to be civilized. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; No sir &gt;&gt; with the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; You have not met one yet. &gt;&gt; You have not met the real one yet. &gt;&gt; When he will hit you like an electricity. &gt;&gt; I will see how civilized you going to be. [Applause] If your church don't have one, come and test this one. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Yeah. I'm going to get beside myself. &gt;&gt; When I get beside the king, that's it. It won't be a surprise. I'm already getting beside here as a training. So when I get there, it's a habit. In other words, I won't be surprised. &gt;&gt; You the one who will be surprised is the one that were like this in church. You will be surprised in heaven. &gt;&gt; Brother said there are noises over there and in hell also there are noises. &gt;&gt; So I don't know where you want to go. [Applause] &gt;&gt; As for me and my house, we going to heaven. But we live in heaven already here. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Brother, brother, say, "Oh, there you are." &gt;&gt; What if the little duck say, &gt;&gt; "I just don't like the way he keep his feathers. &gt;&gt; I don't believe I shall follow him." You shall freeze to what? &gt;&gt; I don't like the way he preaches. &gt;&gt; I don't like his English. You are you will freeze to death. &gt;&gt; It's not a matter of preference. It's a matter of life. [Applause] &gt;&gt; If God choose a short man, sub it. &gt;&gt; A torment sub it. A heavy set it. &gt;&gt; What I'm looking for is what is God telling me? when I get what God want me to hear. God bless you, brother. See you next Sunday. &gt;&gt; I was looking for my message. In other words, you are like a postman office. &gt;&gt; He's just delivering the mail. &gt;&gt; You don't build relationship. &gt;&gt; Get a mail and get me my mail and see you again for the next mail. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't like the post office men that come here. &gt;&gt; So you won't receive the mail at home &gt;&gt; when it's post office. You don't make preference. &gt;&gt; When it's the bank, you don't make preference. &gt;&gt; When it's McDonald, you don't make preference. When it's the church, &gt;&gt; then you begin to draw a list. &gt;&gt; Check. Check. Check. Check. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Go to the earth &gt;&gt; and learn a kingdom &gt;&gt; that are in direct contact with the maker. &gt;&gt; I have not started preaching. I'm on the first uh scripture. &gt;&gt; Can you swallow something? &gt;&gt; You'll be able to handle it. &gt;&gt; You won't get mad on me. Anyway, even if you get mad on me, I will deliver it. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; You think you can swallow this? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You promise? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Devon, you promise. Ah, brother Devon, say yes. Brother Bradam says this. He says there is something about women. &gt;&gt; I told you, you say you going to, but we're going to get it. &gt;&gt; I told you you say you're going to get it. So, we want to skip. Ah. So let him move it. You want to hear it? &gt;&gt; This stage is something. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. So that's your problem. Brother Brandham said there is something about who &gt;&gt; woman &gt;&gt; that is a little different than what? &gt;&gt; Usually she's got a high instinct. [Applause] I was trying to hide this code but I can't &gt;&gt; I hope we don't have legalistic here because they will pass out and they need to be CPR right now. There is something about what &gt;&gt; woman &gt;&gt; that she has a what? &gt;&gt; A high instinct. &gt;&gt; That's why be careful with mama &gt;&gt; when she's saying something. &gt;&gt; Mama can look at a girl and say, "My boy, not this one." [Applause] &gt;&gt; Mama can look at a man and say, "Hey honey, this your your friend there. I just don't like him." Well, well, because there is a mistake. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And usually men are rational. Well, well, I don't see any problem with him. &gt;&gt; He say, you know what? You do whatever you want to do, but I I just I won't be part of it. So honey, you don't want to support me. When it's your turn, I support you. You don't want to support me on your part. Uh you don't understand what it is.

I have quote. &gt;&gt; I wish I have time. Lord help me. Because I I I'm going to go with this slowly because our young people must be free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to say something that's going to be too strong, &gt;&gt; but you will understand me one day. &gt;&gt; The ant. Who's working in the end? &gt;&gt; I mean, who's working on the summer? &gt;&gt; The ant. &gt;&gt; Because this just came down, brother Clay, and I have to deliver it. &gt;&gt; Who's working in autumn? &gt;&gt; The ant. He's working for who? &gt;&gt; The winter. &gt;&gt; He's working for who? &gt;&gt; For the company. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; He's working for who? &gt;&gt; Himself. &gt;&gt; For himself to live where? &gt;&gt; In the winter. &gt;&gt; So who's manufacturing his own future? &gt;&gt; The answer is. &gt;&gt; So who's preparing his own future? &gt;&gt; So who should prepare your future? I don't know if you getting me. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Father, help your children. &gt;&gt; Who should prepare your Not my future? &gt;&gt; I'm already here. &gt;&gt; Who should prepare your future? &gt;&gt; You. &gt;&gt; Brother Lam, who should prepare your future? &gt;&gt; So if your future flacks, If your &gt;&gt; I believe it. &gt;&gt; If your marriage is in trouble, &gt;&gt; let's watch the preparation. &gt;&gt; Let's go back to the preparation.

A's and B's. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your future is right here in your hand. &gt;&gt; In other words, the creator is bringing that to you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.

So you have no blame on me. I am completely innocent. &gt;&gt; I have tape and quote and everything. If you miss meeting that was not my problem. I told you three months ahead, four month ahead, everything. That was your own problem. &gt;&gt; So me, your blood is not in my I'm going to heaven singing. [Music] &gt;&gt; Whatever you do now, you are cooking your future. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Whatever you do with money now, you are cooking your future. [Applause] Where are we at, my friend? &gt;&gt; Verse eight. &gt;&gt; Ah, verse eight. Provide her meat when &gt;&gt; in the summer &gt;&gt; and gather her food when &gt;&gt; in the harvest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We finished the first uh reading. Let's go to the second reading. Proverb 10 verse 5. &gt;&gt; Second scripture. &gt;&gt; Then when I finish, you give me 45 minutes to stop preaching. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of you will get heart attack. Thank God it won't happen in church. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Proverb 10, what? Verse 5. &gt;&gt; He that gatherth when &gt;&gt; in summer. &gt;&gt; Do you see what happened? &gt;&gt; Now it's not the end. God is going back to human being. Now &gt;&gt; he that gatherereth when &gt;&gt; in summer &gt;&gt; is a what? &gt;&gt; Wise son. &gt;&gt; So the wisdom of that son is determined by what? the gathering when in season. &gt;&gt; So wisdom what I'm trying to show you see wisdom is depend is defined by the action in season. &gt;&gt; If the son begin to gather within summer the bible say he's a wise son &gt;&gt; because he's a son that now it's synchronizing with God's program. &gt;&gt; God program harvest start on summer. The ant are working. You need to be working too. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have a question because some of you are like carpet people. &gt;&gt; Do you know carpet? The people that live for the present time. &gt;&gt; So they don't care about tomorrow. &gt;&gt; You give me you give him the money, they burn it today. They say tomorrow you'll be okay. &gt;&gt; Hey, let me live. Tomorrow I may die. So let me just burn it today. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's in Latin if I'm not mistaken. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The ant work in the summer in the fall. Do you think the ant work in winter? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; So why don't you wait for the winter break? &gt;&gt; You are taking break in the summer. &gt;&gt; Then in the winter it will not be the season of a harvest &gt;&gt; and you have to work now harder &gt;&gt; because you are working against the season. Amen. &gt;&gt; You pray your prayer are not answer because you are of the season. &gt;&gt; Wait my friend, &gt;&gt; I'm just at the surface of this. I have not dumped to yet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then you find out you are praying, you are praying, nothing is working. Nothing is working because check what you miss. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; When God was knocking at the door because the scripture say today &gt;&gt; if you hear his voice, harden not your heart. Because today means tomorrow they can close that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, help me up. &gt;&gt; He say he, let's go, my friend. He that does what &gt;&gt; gatherth in summer &gt;&gt; is a water. &gt;&gt; A wise son. &gt;&gt; But he that do what &gt;&gt; sleepeth in harvest &gt;&gt; is a water &gt;&gt; is a son that causth shame. &gt;&gt; So in the harvest, what is this other son doing? &gt;&gt; Sleeping. So when you sleeping, somebody's working. &gt;&gt; So there is two people in the same season. &gt;&gt; One is wise by the way of working and one is foolish &gt;&gt; by the way of his behaving based on the season. &gt;&gt; So when I see you &gt;&gt; correct &gt;&gt; and I look at the season &gt;&gt; and I watch your behavioral, &gt;&gt; I already know the trouble that is coming ahead. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm warning you and you think I'm tight. I'm too strong. I don't want you to have fun. &gt;&gt; I'm already I'm always controlling. Where are you? What are you doing? What are you What are you What I'm just protecting you &gt;&gt; to utilize and maximize your season now to prepare your future. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because there will come a time I won't call you. Amen. &gt;&gt; You grown up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And at that time you will be looking for my phone call. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; That was the second scripture. Let's go to the third scripture. Proverb 30. &gt;&gt; Now you start doing good when we ending toward the end. Proverb 30. uh sister, we might have to change taking advantage and push it next week because we might have to find another subject. &gt;&gt; If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. Proverb 30:24 there be what? &gt;&gt; Four things &gt;&gt; which are how &gt;&gt; little upon the earth. &gt;&gt; Very little. But how? &gt;&gt; They are exceeding wise. &gt;&gt; Do you see what I'm saying? The ant are a people what? &gt;&gt; Not strong. &gt;&gt; So it doesn't mean it doesn't depend on a physical strength. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not strong yet they prepare the what? &gt;&gt; Their meat &gt;&gt; in the water. &gt;&gt; The summer. &gt;&gt; If you notice they are very little, &gt;&gt; not strength but &gt;&gt; exceedingly wise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The little thing but they are making big accomplishment. A small David &gt;&gt; is the one to bring Goliath down. &gt;&gt; Not a big Saul. A small David &gt;&gt; because David was connected &gt;&gt; to the maker. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And because he was connected to the maker, he can bring Goliath down. When everybody that was there, nobody could touch Goliath. &gt;&gt; We clear? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We clear? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Matthew 24. Ah, praise God. Finally, we moving. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Matthew 24. &gt;&gt; Don't worry, my friend. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to finish &gt;&gt; for those and your prayer will be answered. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; And watch how long you going to stay in a restaurant. &gt;&gt; If you there, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. until the waitress told you, "Look at you like you need to leave." &gt;&gt; You there? &gt;&gt; You there? &gt;&gt; Are we there? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh Matthew 24. If you there, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 45, the Bible say, "Who then is a faithful and a what?" &gt;&gt; "And wise servant." &gt;&gt; A faithful and a wise servant. Brother Robert. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. whom his lord has made ruler over what &gt;&gt; his household. So brother Tony &gt;&gt; to be a ruler in God's household there are qualification. &gt;&gt; God require you to be faithful &gt;&gt; and to be wise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To lead his people. You got to be faithful &gt;&gt; and you got to be wise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. We clear. &gt;&gt; We clear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To give them what? &gt;&gt; Meat. &gt;&gt; In what? &gt;&gt; In due season. &gt;&gt; Do you see that again? So the one on top of the household of God &gt;&gt; is not just the ruler. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is not that just there to give command. &gt;&gt; You go there. You go there. No. No. No. No. No. No. The ruler is wise &gt;&gt; and he's also faithful. But the reason why he's wise is God is depending on the ruler &gt;&gt; to distribute food. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There it is, brother. in due season. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; In other word, wisdom is again reflected by the ability to distribute food in due season. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, &gt;&gt; I'm driving one point today stronger. So wisdom again is determined by the ability to synchronize with the season. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you don't give the food correctly, &gt;&gt; then you cannot rule God's house. &gt;&gt; That's why the scripture say properly &gt;&gt; dividing the word. &gt;&gt; You must know when is what message to give. &gt;&gt; You must know that now it's milk. &gt;&gt; Now it's a steak. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The food is already there, &gt;&gt; but you got to know how to properly when which season to give what. &gt;&gt; So that's why a pastor must depend on God. The holy the preacher must depend on God to tell him which food &gt;&gt; to give in which season which message to preach &gt;&gt; because a word spoken in due season. &gt;&gt; A sermon given in the correct season, &gt;&gt; it's a sermon that is bringing healing. [Music] Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Luke even explained this this way. Luke say the Lord say who then is a faithful and what &gt;&gt; wise steward &gt;&gt; whom the Lord shall make ruler over what? &gt;&gt; His household &gt;&gt; to do what? &gt;&gt; Give them their portion &gt;&gt; of meat when &gt;&gt; in due season. &gt;&gt; The meat already belong to you. &gt;&gt; It is your portion &gt;&gt; but it have to be given in due season. Amen. &gt;&gt; So again, wisdom is connected to the ability to discern and to act on the season. &gt;&gt; If you are a steward correctly, that is wise. You have to watch the season &gt;&gt; before you give the food. &gt;&gt; So wisdom is connected to season. Wisdom of the earth connected to season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Let me finish with this scripture because I can't preach. I have to finish with the reading of the scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's finish with reading the scripture and we pick up next Sunday. &gt;&gt; Let's jump to Matthew 25. &gt;&gt; I don't know if it's sister Sharon who held this sermon until she comes back &gt;&gt; to hear it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You there? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then shall the kingdom of heaven be what? &gt;&gt; Likened unto 10 virgins. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. You know this very well. &gt;&gt; Which took what? &gt;&gt; Their lamps &gt;&gt; and went forth to meet the who? &gt;&gt; The bridegroom. &gt;&gt; They were going to marriage. &gt;&gt; Verse two. And five of them were how? &gt;&gt; Were wise. &gt;&gt; You remember I was telling you about wise and foolish. &gt;&gt; You remember that? &gt;&gt; Five were what? &gt;&gt; Wise. &gt;&gt; And other were what? &gt;&gt; Foolish. &gt;&gt; We need to know what made the five wise. &gt;&gt; Come on, father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ah. Ah &gt;&gt; flight attendant prepare for landing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One was called foolish. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; One is called wise. &gt;&gt; Why is one made the other one wise? &gt;&gt; One is wisdom reflected through. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Verse verse three. They that were foolish did what? &gt;&gt; Took their lamps. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. And but what? &gt;&gt; And took no oil with them. &gt;&gt; But the wise did what? &gt;&gt; Took oil in their vessels with their lamps. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. So the scripture is describing to us the did &gt;&gt; the action &gt;&gt; of each group of the virgin. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; We got a foolish virgin and we got a wise virgin. The scripture now is describing as what made one foolish. And what made one what? &gt;&gt; And wisdom is described &gt;&gt; to the fact that one took oil &gt;&gt; beyond preparation time [Laughter] [Applause] &gt;&gt; spoken word tabernacle. When the opening of the the at the opening of the seals the Bible became what? &gt;&gt; Do you know how many time we read this quote this scripture? Look how it's coming up now. &gt;&gt; In other word when the virgin were preparing &gt;&gt; all of them were virgin. &gt;&gt; All of them were in the message. [Applause] All of them were virgin. &gt;&gt; All of them knew the same message. &gt;&gt; The message was we need to go meet the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; We need to go to the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because the bridegroom was coming. &gt;&gt; The Lord was coming. So all of them knew the message. And brother Brandham say virgin means that they were sanctified. &gt;&gt; So all of them were living good &gt;&gt; very good regalistic my people &gt;&gt; are we together &gt;&gt; but one group was wise &gt;&gt; one was what? &gt;&gt; Foolish. &gt;&gt; Both of them got lamp. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Both of them have lamp with oil. &gt;&gt; If you judge them by virgin, all of them enter. &gt;&gt; I'm going to the airport, my friend. So, buckle up. We going to land. If you judge them by the fact that both of them knew the bridegroom is coming, all of them will enter. &gt;&gt; If you judge them by the ability that they are all preparing to go meet the badgroom, all of them qualify. If you judge them by the ability that they got a lamp, &gt;&gt; all of them got a lamp. &gt;&gt; If you judge them by the ability that the lamp got oil, &gt;&gt; all of them qualify. &gt;&gt; But there is a difference. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Because brother Kelly, there was two season. &gt;&gt; I'm heading to the airport. I'm heading to the airport. There is a wedding season, &gt;&gt; a season to terry &gt;&gt; and wait for the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; And there was a season of the coming &gt;&gt; sle &gt;&gt; because the Bible says, let's read so we got it clear. Verse five, while the bridegroom did what? &gt;&gt; Terry, &gt;&gt; they all did what? &gt;&gt; Slumbered and slept. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. So there was a season of tearing. &gt;&gt; When the tearing season was there, every lamp was on. &gt;&gt; The oil that was in the lamp was for one season. [Laughter] [Applause] [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Spoken word. &gt;&gt; Are we together? The oil for the lamp was to last only for the wedding season. &gt;&gt; The oil of the lamp could not go over. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Remember the ant when he's in the summer? &gt;&gt; He work for which month? &gt;&gt; A month ahead. So the foolish virgin as they are going &gt;&gt; they were not preparing only for the wedding. &gt;&gt; They were they were looking beyond the wedding. &gt;&gt; Let me start it again. The Bible say why the bridegroom Terry they all did what? Everybody slumber and slept. &gt;&gt; So if you want to disqualify everybody, you will disqualify everybody because all of them slumber and left. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So the up to this point everybody's behaving the same. &gt;&gt; Everybody's bride. &gt;&gt; But watch now verse uh six. And at midnight there was a what? &gt;&gt; A cry made &gt;&gt; did what? &gt;&gt; Behold &gt;&gt; what? &gt;&gt; The bridegroom cometh. &gt;&gt; Go you out to what? &gt;&gt; To meet him. So a a a a shout came &gt;&gt; and introduced another season. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Let me explain this so we can land. Okay. &gt;&gt; There is a difference between somebody who's waiting &gt;&gt; and somebody who has been informed that now they calling you. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; If you work with me, we get to the airport. My friend, &gt;&gt; somebody who's waiting will be sitting like this. &gt;&gt; Maybe sometime they pull their cell phone &gt;&gt; because they're waiting. &gt;&gt; Are we together? And they can get online. Some of them will be some of us will be even on the phone. &gt;&gt; Some will put FaceTime and then they continue because they know that they're waiting to be called by the doctor. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So there is a behavior in the wedding. But when they say fat dog me &gt;&gt; the season have changed. &gt;&gt; If you are on the cell phone &gt;&gt; you got to j the cell phone. You got to pick up your stuff. You got to pick up everything. You got to remove everything for you. Your belongings in the playroom in the in the in the wedding room. You got to get your luggage ready &gt;&gt; because you going to enter. So when the midnight cry came he he he announc another season. &gt;&gt; So everybody that was slumbering &gt;&gt; and sleeping have to do what? &gt;&gt; Now another season open up &gt;&gt; and that season require another oil. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Because when they woke up and they checked the lamp, &gt;&gt; let's let's read it. So you say it's coming from the Bible. We there &gt;&gt; then all verse seven. Then all those virgin did what? &gt;&gt; A rose. &gt;&gt; They qualify by being arosed. &gt;&gt; Amen. By being I mean reason. Amen. And all those virgin did what? &gt;&gt; A rose. &gt;&gt; And trim their what? &gt;&gt; Their lamps. &gt;&gt; And the foolish said to the wise, give us of water &gt;&gt; your oil. For our lamp are what? &gt;&gt; Are gone out. &gt;&gt; So the lamp was only lasting &gt;&gt; for a season &gt;&gt; and the bridegroom &gt;&gt; Terry &gt;&gt; until the first oil was gone. &gt;&gt; I'm I hope you are understanding me. &gt;&gt; Are we together? When the first oil was gone and the lamp was going out, that's when the bridegroom begin to come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he came, the foolish now was now disclosed to be foolish &gt;&gt; because in the preparation time, &gt;&gt; they were not preparing ahead. &gt;&gt; Amen. They were preparing for the summer, but they were not preparing for the winter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So, the wisdom was determined by the ability. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To prepare oil. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; For the oncoming season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse eight, then we finish. and give. And the foolish said to the wise, give us of your old, for our land our water &gt;&gt; are gone out. &gt;&gt; But the wise answered, saying, not so, lest there be not enough for who? &gt;&gt; Us and you. &gt;&gt; But you do what? &gt;&gt; Go ye rather to them that sell &gt;&gt; and do what? &gt;&gt; And buy for yourself. &gt;&gt; And while they went &gt;&gt; to do what? &gt;&gt; To buy. &gt;&gt; Now they begin to look for oil in the wrong season. There is &gt;&gt; they begin to look for the all in the wrong season. There was a season to prepare for the all. They missed the season. Now when another season is coming, they trying to get the all. They miss the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; Church learn to walk with the season. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Verse 10. And why they went to do what? &gt;&gt; Buy &gt;&gt; the bridegroom did what? &gt;&gt; Why is it that as soon as they left? &gt;&gt; They didn't have cell phone. &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; They didn't have iPad. &gt;&gt; As soon as they left, what happened? &gt;&gt; Bridegroom came. &gt;&gt; The bridegroom came &gt;&gt; and they found which oil was now kicking in. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The second &gt;&gt; the second oil was kicking in for the marriage. &gt;&gt; Are we together? He said the bridegroom came and they that were how &gt;&gt; ready &gt;&gt; what made them ready? &gt;&gt; The second oil &gt;&gt; they were by what? The ability to pick up the second oil &gt;&gt; toward the journey made them wise. &gt;&gt; In other words, they prepare for the oncoming season. &gt;&gt; They were not going in man with the wedding season. &gt;&gt; They were going with the wedding season and the coming season together. &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe when they were picking up oil, their friend were making fun of him. &gt;&gt; The friend say, "What else do you have?" We already got one bottle. &gt;&gt; Huh? Why do you need two bottles? &gt;&gt; But we only have one bottle. Why do you need two bottles? But what happened to the first bottle? &gt;&gt; The first bottle is finished. The bridegroom has come. &gt;&gt; The ability to carry two bottle &gt;&gt; is what was the wisdom at. &gt;&gt; Today you going to church. &gt;&gt; Today you're reading the message. Today you're going to question and answer. You going to young men meeting. You going to young sister. You are investing your time. And while your friend &gt;&gt; other young people are having fun, &gt;&gt; they are going for party. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; They are going for meeting. They are going for young people gathering. They are following after any kind of young people recreational, young people concert. But you are staying focused because one of this day when you will begin to use the second oil, you will see them broke. You will see them lingering &gt;&gt; because they miss the season. Let whoever make fun of you, let them make fun of you. You stay focused. Focus in the season. Focus in the working. Focus to get the second oil. [Music] Because there will come a time when you will be relaxing with the bridegroom &gt;&gt; and other people are going &gt;&gt; and they suffer. And do you know the gut oil? &gt;&gt; It's written in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Do you know the gut oil? &gt;&gt; We don't know when but they all was not valid. &gt;&gt; When they came back they knock. &gt;&gt; It was too late. &gt;&gt; Amen. The other one were there getting beside themselves, &gt;&gt; beside the king that day. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the other one was outside. The Bible say in nashing of teeth. You take this spiritually and naturally. Spiritually somebody missed the rapture. &gt;&gt; When you are investing, somebody will miss the rapture. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Because by the ability to predict the future &gt;&gt; and God send us an ego. &gt;&gt; William Marion Brana And he gave us signal &gt;&gt; to know the season. When you see a woman rising in America wearing purple, when you see a second Catholic president, when you see a Catholic pope, &gt;&gt; the season is clear, what are you doing? &gt;&gt; Instead of getting ready for the going, you are playing around. But that's for me and my house. [Applause] As for me and my wife, we will serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Wisdom is described by the ability &gt;&gt; the ability &gt;&gt; to synchronize with the season. &gt;&gt; You might be made fun of today. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If you go to college, &gt;&gt; four years is not easy. But when you are there staying all night, all night your friend are in Walmart, &gt;&gt; your friend are playing, &gt;&gt; your friend are joking, your friend are in downtown, they are gathering and tomorrow one graduate &gt;&gt; and when you look it's four years. &gt;&gt; You've been in school seven years. You can't graduate. What happened? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the school is meant for four years. Why are you there seven years? Why are you in two years college four years? &gt;&gt; What are you doing? &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; What are you doing in your summer? What are you doing in your time? What are you doing?

There was a time we had question and answer every month. &gt;&gt; It doesn't happen anymore because the season have changed. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; All or every every session you miss. That's your problem. The season have changed and it's one month and it's every quarter. You don't know if it's going to be six month and the season is changing. &gt;&gt; That's correct, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; When do you want to get ready for marriage? &gt;&gt; Amen. Because marriage will catch you &gt;&gt; just like the bridegroom coming will catch you. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; There will come a time when God say you going to get married the marriage will come. &gt;&gt; The problem is are you ready for that? Did you prepare during the preparation time for that marriage? If not you will enter and prepare. You will be happy you got a husband who will clap hand but what is coming up is a disaster. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; What is coming up?

Can't get an apartment. Now mama have to come and sign. &gt;&gt; Daddy have to cosign &gt;&gt; because what were you doing in the preparation time? &gt;&gt; God doesn't see make you sit like this for nothing. &gt;&gt; God young sister God doesn't make you wait for nothing. God knows why you waiting. Use your waiting time &gt;&gt; to get this second oil [Applause] &gt;&gt; for the coming of the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; I can go with this in every aspect of your life. Every aspect of your life. Where are we at? &gt;&gt; Where are we at? &gt;&gt; Let me stop here. &gt;&gt; Let's stand. I don't know why the Holy Spirit keep pushing this, but we will get even into your life and show you how your life is is revolving per year. And I'm going to show you how your life is changing in in years. I will get through the scripture and I'll get to the message and then you see what happened and you will wonder why certain things happen and certain things don't happen. Amen. &gt;&gt; There will be a time you will be solicitated. &gt;&gt; There will come a time it looks like nobody sees you &gt;&gt; and you don't understand and you begin to pump. You put your picture on Facebook, you put your picture on Instagram, you make all kind of video to make uh attraction. Nobody sees that because you are synchronizing out of season &gt;&gt; and you are putting effort in something that you are not supposed to turn around and find if this is not working what is supposed to be in this season &gt;&gt; and work on that one. &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. Amen. &gt;&gt; Versus what you're trying to do. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's exactly &gt;&gt; some of you I'm I don't even blame you because it's a move in the message &gt;&gt; with young people. It was happening between the churches. I don't mind fellowship with other churches but I'm careful because I don't want spirit. Brother Brandham say churches got spirit. &gt;&gt; I don't want you to go somewhere and pick up spirit from there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In that church they doing this and you want to do it with that church. know that church might be out of synchrony. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But if you stay in your season, they will come to you and say, "Please tell us how do you do this? How did you end up like this?" &gt;&gt; But it's a move under the fellowship of the message of the hour. Then it's a move. If it start somewhere over there, it's going to catch fire there. It catch fire. Catch fire. Fire. Okay, we did a bonfire here. Okay, other young people also would do bonfire over there. Then other would do bonfire there. Then then it's bonfire everywhere and then it's something over there and and and it's like a &gt;&gt; moveh a wise young man, a wise young sister, &gt;&gt; you pull away from the crew. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; From the piece come off &gt;&gt; look at them from the outside. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I was young too.

Yes, &gt;&gt; father. &gt;&gt; You know the reason why you don't want this to be preached yet. You want certain principle to be laid in for the young people, for the older, those that are here visible and invisible audience. Father, I pray Lord that this goes deeper than the brain. May you drop down into the soul Lord of your children so that they can catch the revelation and understand that the spirit of the Lord cannot speak in vain. When you bring, you are bringing not condemnation but deliverance. So that Lord, your children can be completely and totally delivered and be prepared for what you're trying to bring in their life. Father, may you go with the congregation. May they spend some time meditating. May they review, may you come down and quicken and show them a clear path of what they need to do because the hour is late for your coming. The hour is late for many things, Lord. Father, help spoken word, help your children. Those that travel, Father, give them travel mercy. Those that are struggling, Lord, may you deliver them. Those that the devil has been pulling away, may you deliver them. those that are blinded, may you remove that blindness like you did for Gazi. Father, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ that your grace and mercy be upon us. Strengthen us and be with us on this oncoming week. Lord, we thank you for everything in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Church, God bless you. We love you. [Applause] [Music] Amen. I can hear my savior calling. I can hear my Savior calling. Take thy cross and follow. [Music] Follow me.
