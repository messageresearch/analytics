so we will have a wonderful service and heaven open and the glory of the lord pour down amen let's go straight to our scripture tonight it'll be in the book of ruth amen blessed be the name of the lord ruth chapter 2 if you dare you can say amen verse 15. this is after roof have eaten she was invited at the table and she did eat and when she finished the bible say and when she was raised up to glean [Music] to work again boaz commanded his young man saying let her glean even among the sheaves and reproach her not a man so her area of gleaning is now getting bigger amen and late fall also some of the handful of purpose for her so she's not the only one working now but god is working through the reapers and leave them that she may glean them and rebuke her not so she gleaned in the field until evening and beat out that she had green and he was about a nephi of barley for some reason i can't even touch this eva amen verse 18 and she took it up and went into the city and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned and she brought forth and gave to her that she had reserved after she was so fast you might be seated in other words roof is still working she's laboring she's serving and at the end of her labor her serving she's ending up with food amen food that she work for and food from the reapers which are the angels amen let's go to john chapter 6 we read it again just gonna read it over again john chapter 6 verse 25 if you dare you can say amen and when they have found him on the other side of the sea they say to him rubber when when came you here amen jesus answered and said verily verily i say unto you you seek me not because you saw the miracles because the miracles were for a purpose but because you did it of the loaves and where fell amen that was natural food verse 27 lab or not you understand roof laboring now labor not for the meat which perishes but for the meat which endureth unto everlasting life so roof has to work she has to labor for food amen which is a type of eternal life amen which the son of man this food is given by the son of man and we know boaz is a type of christ and christ is the son of man amen blessed be the name of lord which the son of man shall give you so this food is given by the son of man by you laboring for it amen everybody okay the food is given by the son of man roof go ahead and glean you the reapers give her food but you gotta put your input to it so it's god giving you but you got to work for it amen hallelujah for him has the father sealed then say dead to him if you want to know where the seal of the father is you got to go through the son of man then say day to him what shall we do that we might work the works of god amen jesus answered and say to them this is the work of god singular that you do what on whom on him whom he has water so everything the best is the foundation of everything is faith if the foundation the beginning is wrong everything else is going to be out of place amen let's go to philippians chapter 2. few wins the folks out don't know where they are philippians 2 if you dare you can say amen verse 12 wherefore my beloved as you have always done what everybody care not as in my presence only i don't want hypocrisy but now much more in my absence everybody here paul is speaking uh he's talking about the obedience when he's not around because they want to test the obedience of roof anybody care when boaz is not iran everybody care in the absence of boaz what do you do amen but now much more in my absence work out again your salvation i thought salvation is free yes it's free when you hit the praise and alter it's free but when you begin to move forward you gotta work amen at the present altar you don't have to die for your sin you don't have to do anything everything you have to do accept jesus christ deal done but as you're progressing there's no lazy people in the kingdom of god anybody care you got to do some work you got to wake up you got to go to church got to do some work amen work out your own salvation not the salvation of somebody else your own salvation how with fear in other words with respect who are you respecting when you're working with fear and water trembling with fear when you're working when you're laboring you must have respect and trembling because paul told the the gentile he said you do you need to be careful if the original branch uh israel was plugged out because of what they did you got to be careful do not forget the severity of god if he did it to his own children how much more you amen so there is kind of a discipline right there everybody care for it is you which worketh only few people caught it i hope you're not sleeping it is god which do water working in water so if god is working in you you must surrender everybody care amen for it is god which worketh in you buff to water and to water so the ability to receive and to do it it's not you amen anybody care they are the the will to do and the doing it's god amen to do of his good pleasure everybody care he does everything according to his good pleasure everybody cares so far let's go ahead and pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly tonight father thanking you for your grace for your love for your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father you have given us another opportunity on a wednesday night to be able to gather together with scent of like precious faith around the revealed word of the hour lord i have done what any man that you give ability can do lord father when it comes to the blessing and unfolding and giving revelation he only take the supernatural action of the holy spirit lord father we are limited on our ability but you are the supreme anointing you are the unlimited one father may you move me completely out of the way may you come and bless your children and father visit us tonight in a special way be the alpha and the omega as we commit everything unto the hand in jesus precious name amen god richly bless you everybody okay we went on sunday with ruth laboring today we are on the face on the four faces of roof roof legalist when you say the word legalist he usually scare people but we know we understand now our legalism is different brother branham says this i'm gonna get to that in our tabernacle language we are dealing with roof in the holy place and we have been dealing with the new spirit according to ezekiel because ezekiel say according to the three stages you must have a new heart everybody care you must have a new spirit amen and then the holy ghost will get there everybody care the new heart you understand that clearly the new spirit we already explained halfway about here and we need to know what's going on because the new heart is actually happening under justification everybody okay and the new spirit is happening under sanctification amen and the holy spirit here is when you are baptized or when you are converted or when you are born again all those things are speaking about the same thing it's just different terminology you need to understand the prophet differently amen brother brown i'm under legalistic he said roof under sanctification which is the second stage is laboring which we talked about it on sunday and roof laboring means roof legalist how can you labor and be a legalist everybody okay and brother bottom say roof resting waiting for boaz to return from the finish work we're not there yet amen we found under this serving here that roof now has been given full access into the field of boas she have been given some grace that the reapers have instruction every time she's laboring they need to add more food amen and at the end we found out that there is an expected end roof is going home with a nifa of food if you don't understand what a nifa of food is let me kind of help you up let's go to exodus chapter 16 so you understand what it means because this bible is hidden let's go to exodus chapter 16. so you understand when to say anifa of barley what else enifa means everybody okay exodus chapter 16 verse 16. if you there you can say amen let me start from 14 so you get a background okay we good and when they do that lay was gone up in other words there was a dude that was coming up in the camp of israel and when they do left behold upon the face of the wilderness their a small round thing as small as the whole frost on the ground so when israel woke up they see a lot of things on the ground in other words the whole ground is covered with a lot of small grain verse 15 and when the children of israel saw it they say one to another it is water it is manna for they knew not what it was and moses said to them this is the water so mana is a bread you already understand this mana is a bread amen and we know that roof came back from moab because they heard that there was water bred in israel everybody okay so far okay stay tuned verse 15 and when the children of israel saw it they say one to another it is manna for they knew not what it was and moses said to them this is the bread which the lord has done water so it's a given bread amen from the lord to eat amen everybody here but even though the bread is given you must work remember the manner you got to pick it up and you got to work on it and cook it before you eat just like roof everybody okay verse 16 this is the thing which the lord has commanded gather of it of the manner every man according to his eating and water so the measurement that was given for mana is called a number amen and a normal was a measurement that fit one person amen back here so when mana is falling on the ground if you pick up one armor don't worry you are covered for the whole day god knows how to measure amen gather of it every man according to his eating an armor for every man not two hormones just one one is sufficient for the whole day if you wake up you get one hour of mana you done for the day you can go the whole day without any more food amen the bible continue and say according to the number of your person take you every man for them which are in his tent so if you're a family of five we expected you to have five homers if you're a family of two you take two homers if you're a family of ten you take ten homer you don't take more than 10. god doesn't want wastage everybody okay if you need that's the reason why when he multiplied the bread and the bread was left he told the people gather up the bread because god does not want wasting amen you need the code you see me amen and in verse 17 and the children of israel did so and gather some more some according to the size of your family and when they did meet in other words when they measure when they did meet it when they measure it with phenomena he that gathereth much had nothing over and he the gathered leader has no luck they gather every man according to his water so if you have five armor it doesn't mean that you have more food than me it means you are five people in your house if i have two armor and then you have ten armors we have no difference because no matter how much how many armor you have in your house it will be only for one person so you cannot come out of your house and brag at me that i have more food than you nobody lacked anything nobody was starving everybody was in good health just with one measure i wish we can find that measure and give it to everybody so we don't have to worry about it anybody care so you don't have to worry about who's eating two hamburgers and one is eating one hamburger this is one measure for everybody anybody okay and then verse 19 and moses say let no man leave of feet until there so we found out that every person in israel fitted one measure and that measure was a number everybody okay so far job to verse uh 36 you know what let's go by uh verse 32 if you dare you can say amen and moses say this is the thing which the lord commands god gave a new commandment fill a water anybody okay a number of it to be kept for your generations you understand now everybody one of them god said take a number of them in other in other words take the capacity of one man because the one who enter in the holiest is only one no two people only the high priest everybody okay and take only one measure and take it to the most holy place and put it over there and that manner never never never never can have any trouble amen so when the high priest entered there the high priest can eat and be surpassed without any problem and leave if the second person enter you're gonna find another ombre again amen and the way to the holiest was blocked only the high priest could enter but with the death of jesus christ the way open up so now we can go one by one and we can get everybody a number everybody will be filled with the holy spirit and nobody will like the holy ghost you say how does it happen do you remember jesus multiplying the bread he only had one in his hand when he cut the bread what happened to the other bread back again until everybody was filled because he's the fountain of living water amen you don't take water out any decrees the more you take the more he comes up anybody okay so far so he says phil and norma verse 32 of it to be kept for your generation that they may see the bread wherewith i have fed you in the wilderness when i brought you forth from the land of egypt and moses said to aaron take a part and put a normal fool which is the capacity of one man full of mana darwin and laid it up before the lord and be kept for your generation anybody okay as the lord commanded moses so aaron laid it up before the testimony to be kept and the children of israel did eat mana 40 years until they came to the land inhabited they did eat mana until they came to the borders of the land of canaan again remember one armor is a measure for one person everybody okay watch now now verse 36 now and number is the water is the taff anybody okay a normal is the third part of water so for you to have one ifa you need ten armors ten armors equal one ifa anybody here an armor was a food for one day anybody here and roof work one day it's okay now and produce a neefer [Music] everybody here in other words one working day of roof made a food for ten days amen amen am i reading a different scripture a different bible everybody here and how many people were there at home ten divided by two it's what five for naomi and five four everybody okay what does five means grace for naomi and greg for who any question so far everybody okay so when they say we never for your own salvation it is for your good. how can one person work one day and produce the food for 10 days because the portion of other food was coming from boast he was adding the surplus and but here he was multiplying the food [Music] everybody okay so far so when you are engaging the work of god you are automatically under the shower of god you must expect some increase that you cannot explain where it happened [Applause] [Music] everybody here you can check your bank account and money is left there but you don't understand how many is left there but all the bills are paid you will understand it better buy and buy everybody here the bible say i know the thought that i think for you say the lord touch of water and not of water to give you water i want you to be happy at the end i know what i'm doing just do what i tell you to do and the more you're doing it the more multiplication you're having everybody here so if one day roof produced one ether what happened the second day how many infer what happened in one week how many food was in the house of ruth in one week and what and now roof open another door to begin to give charity and she meet cornelius because remember cornelius under sanctification he was doing many arms you remember because somebody is following the commandment the commandment is for your good it's going to give you an expected end everybody cares so far so on sunday we stopped here we found out that under the law of social social applied for your healing in the body and also for your salvation and we were pulling from so-so along that was useful for our healing and that same law apply also for our salvation what was the law brother branham says this amen brother bonham says this he says it shall never work out until you keep your testimony how you must have a testimony that is going on you must have an advertisement for the devil that when you wake up and every morning you are advertising something to satan you say praise the lord for a good day [Applause] you know the deal that you thought i'm going to miss it i'm not going to miss it praise the lord for giving me that deal [Applause] [Laughter] everybody here brother branham said because the bible say believe his prophet and you shall do whatever brother branham said you believe you are saved you need to do whatever. when you testify you are acting also everybody here i think like you are saved and what you do as well you associate with the people everybody here you associate with the people of like precious faith you don't need to be surrendered by pessimists did he help you never surrender yourself with negative people [Music] associate with people that believe big things they have big dreams everybody okay so far if you feel that somebody's trying to block you on the faith move him away if you can't help me don't try to block me move out of my way everybody here so you associate with the people that believe like you because they will encourage you and they will tell you about their experience and their testimony and what god did for them [Applause] that is the law that happened and brother branham said when you do that it will work out for salvation the same thing will take place for divine healing you believe you are healed you act like you are healed you say you are here [Applause] you did your part and the high priest of your quarter whatever you are confessing the high priest of your confession to make good water certain things nothing is impossible to god anything you can confess god is able to do it anything that you confess he has water not everything that god will do [Music] everything that god does what so when you are testifying you don't say thank you jesus for the car you will give me you are testifying as it's already done [Applause] [Music] [Applause] amen if you receive something do you pray for it make sense now so when you receive it by faith brother branham said it is as much real as the thing itself so you are praising god because he's already finished it and when you do that god will step on the scene because you're now working and god will work also and when he work then you're going to get result [Applause] [Music] but here brother branham said when you believe you are safe setting on your seat wherever you are you accept it and begin to confess and tell the people you were well you kept on saying i am water even though you don't look like you saved the people say there ain't no difference in you but you believe there was is that right and you keep and you kept with your confession and after a while it will work out whatever all your neighbor and everybody knows you are because you believe it you confess it why what happened won't change you he is the of your water you take the stone and just throw it away take the stone and throw it toward goliath when the stone is going he's gonna pick up the sun and he's going to enforce it into goliath [Applause] [Music] go to the book of rule of luke i don't know if i would touch what i'm trying to preach let's go to the book of luke we make christianity so much complicated until the people fast for 40 days and they came out there fever with kidney trouble because the body is breaking down amen very simple law let's go to luke 17. if you're there you can say amen verse 11. if you dare you can say amen luke 17 verse 11. he came to pass as he went to jerusalem that he passed through the midst of samaria and galilee right in the midst of it and as he entered into a certain village there met him how many men 10 is it a good number bad number bad wordly carnal anybody care you are bad you are worldly you are carnal everybody okay and dale met him ten men tower water leprosy in the bible means what anybody care so we got ten bad sinners everybody okay wordly people carnal anybody okay amen ten lepers that were ten men that were leopard which stood afar off you remember on sunday leopards have to stay far because they aren't clean and they lift up their voices remember roof when she enter the field of boaz she entered by the law and jesus pick it up and boaz pick it up amen and they lift up their voices and say jesus master have mercy on us and when he saw them everybody okay he said to them go your left proceed is here everybody okay he said go and show yourself to the water go back to the law amen everybody okay you got that proceed there is a solution in the law about your case you need to go to the priest and the priests have to investigate your leopardy and then work it up with you so when they came to jesus they thought automatically oh your leprosy is gone jesus said uh-uh go back to the law anybody here a commandment was given to go to the law it's two ways either you do it or you don't do it anybody care watch it and it came to pass that as they arrive at the priest everybody okay is that what the bible says as the water so because they obey the commandment everybody okay and they believe the commandment and they begin to act upon the commandment before they even reach their priest amen amen god takes over everybody here and remove all the leprosy until when you meet them you cannot have any trace that they were lepers before in other words when you see them you would never believe this man was a gangster amen you will never believe this man was a smoker he doesn't even look like one anybody okay and as they were as they kept as he came to pass that as they went they were water they were cleaned they were cleansed not when they arrived but because they were obedience to the commandment to go unto the priests as they begin to act upon it automatically the second law kick in and take over anybody care amen by the bottom say what happened what changed you he's the high priest of your confession setting at the right hand of the father making good what you are confessing what are you confessing that is the same thing it is by healing you accept him as your healer you renounce your water your symptom it is not by feeling it is by water faith you are healed say you are here believe you are here act like you are here associate with those who believe in water and god will bring you rather to a perfect sadness of water it will never fail everybody here it is the law of god it will never never never fail ever here so if you get a trouble in your life always remember you pray you wake up take the promise of god hold it change the game and begin to go a testimony going on you can even have 10 testimony going on you just put the first one and the second one and the third one and the fourth one don't even brother branham said it is like a fish in the ocean who's afraid to drink water because the ocean one of this day will be out of water you are wasting your time god is not tired to heed your prayer continue to lord god every day once shipping arrived you put a second order when the second order is on the way put a third order when the third order is on the way put another one you're gonna begin to have testimony you will have a traffic of testimony it is so much testimony until you don't know when to tell somebody [Applause] [Laughter] everybody cares so far my god blessed be the name of the lord so how does this law here applied to the legalistic level of ruth how because there is a key to that label the bible says elect according to the full knowledge of god the father he started from your origin through the sanctification of the spirit how does the sanctification of the spirit happen come on the sanctification of the spirit how does it happen unto obedience you obeying the commandment of jesus christ go see the priest and what sprinking off of the water how do you sprinkle the blood of jesus christ the blood is the word you're taking the word and you are applying the word to your life and you obey the word and when you move on that's when the holy spirit picks up as simple as the word is as simple as it is take this believe it that say move on and believe and continue to move on god will kick in and usually at the time that is unexpected in an unexpected place in an unexpected time with an unexpected people and an unexpected result [Music] [Applause] hallelujah and the sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ grace unto you and peace be multiplied the bible says in revelation 12 here that and i heard a loud voice in heaven saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser we know who it is of our brethren is cast down which accuses them before our god how many times if he is there day and night accusing you you must also lord god day and night with your confession so when he accuses you god is confessing to him that's my child that's my child that's my child ever here and the bible said and they descent overcome who how did they overcome him [Music] [Applause] how did they overcome him by water by the blood of the lamb and by the water the word of water praise the lord for healing me praise the lord for healing me praise the lord for healing me praise the lord for leaving me that's how you overcome the devil by applying the word the blood of the lamb and the word of your testimony [Applause] is he complicated you want to get rid of a devil take the medication put on the devil and let him heal your propaganda that's it everybody here that's all everybody here they overcome him by the word of the testimony and they love not their water what is the greatest commandment you shall love the lord above with all your all your in other words the love your love toward him is greater than yourself in other words when they say they're gonna kill you because of this message you say yes yes anybody here you are esteeming your life above i mean your your his life above your own life so how do you overcome him give him the first place in your life apply the blood of the lamb in your life and give the word of the testimony there is no devil that's going to stand on your way is he complicated [Applause] is he complicated is he complicated roof brother branham say the next thing she had to do she had to do autumn she had to work she had to label and when she work she becomes a legalist how can you work and become a legalist amen she had to work out her own salvation with fear and trembling like you did she went out into the field that isn't working and put her clothes upon her and went out into the field and cleaned behind the maiden in order to get sustaining food for the day and one day produced 10 days one day 10 days she can even open a store is that right what was she doing she was trying to find favor with boas so she worked her way through the stage of legalism what does it mean the stage of legalistic anybody care this stage anybody care remember the law was good but the problem with israel the law was not combined by faith that's why they missed god because their law was intended to bring you to christ remember because jesus said if you would have believed moses the lord you would believe me but the reason why you don't believe me is because you never even have faith in the lord everybody okay so far so this stage of legalistic when it is not combined by faith or revelation everybody here it is usually a burden for a believer everybody okay this stage is a stage if you don't have a revelation of what god is doing in your life you will think that god is removing every fun out of your life [Music] everybody here because when they pick up the glass it's dirty there's no problem but when you come to the sanctification they gotta put you in the boiling water they got to put some clorox they got to put some soap when they're doing that you think god is turning you upside down until you don't want to come to church anymore until you feel like you want to run away ever here because it looks like god is blocking you everywhere because roof was free she entered the field of boys as soon as she met boys boaz put a restriction to her you cannot go to any other field no matter how good that field look no matter how appealing that field look you have to stay on a certain field because of a purpose here so your liberty is no more like you used to be in the other court anybody here in the other court you can go anywhere here and you're playing around anybody here but once you enter here you become restricted with the space you can only move much ever here and if you don't understand what god is doing everything you will see it's like they put you into a prison that's why you heard people saying we were in the prison in the message you were not in the prison in the message you were entering a different stage of christianity [Applause] ever here so far this stage is an opportunity for you are we okay to show god an appreciation for what god did for you in the other country [Music] everybody here you are doing that in order to please god because he has been good to you if somebody like i gave you an example before has been good to you when you see that person come around what do you want to do you want to please you you want to do something to show him that hey i'm good towards you because you have been good to me everybody okay so this stage here is a stage of work but that work is an appreciation to show to god that i'm thanking you for what you did for me on calvary are we okay so far blessed be the name of the lord this stage is a stage where god tests your obedience it's a test of your obedience everybody here and they pissed off your response back to god in love amen what am i trying to say there amen god by doing everything boss by doing everything he did for roof he was saying something you got it you got it right when he said don't go anywhere oh if you need a drink go drink and if if it's meal time go eat for free we don't have to pay anything matter of fact you reapers when she's doing something jumping and ruth is going and at the beginning she was going and no reaper look at her but at this time when she's working she see constantly one ripper another one now she doesn't he says why are you giving me all of this it is not the reaper but here it is boaz expressing something towards you but here you are now in the second stage here you are approaching him closely but here he is expressing something towards you and in the in response to his love in other words he's projecting love and he's seen he's watching your reaction if you really love him too in other words boys is saying i love you and he's wanting to see if you're gonna say i love you too but the way you say i love you too is by keeping his commandment [Applause] [Music] everybody okay if you love me do what keep my commandment so when you begin to obey his commandment he is interpreting that that she loves me [Music] i wish the whole church was here everybody okay why is these powers checking you by that that's why naomi said make sure you don't move to another place in other words when you move to another place you're giving him a different response like she's still probably flirting after other young men do you want me to show you that let's go to the book of roof because your boss just dropped it my god for those who waited on sunday sorry everybody here roof chapter 3 verse 10 if you dare you can say amen you there and he said this is boy blessed be of you blessed be you of the lord my for you have showed more what in the latter end than at the water i saw your kindness at the beginning we are still in the other court let me pull a little bit forward and put restriction everybody here it's like a young man you start coding and before you know it who's that boy oh no no no that's a church boy we usually talk to him we play do you know what he's going to tell you i don't like it right i don't want you to talk to that boy anymore i understand you in the church you grew up together but i'm not pleased with the way you talk to him it's too way to do if you love him what do you do is he complicated anybody okay verse 10 so you have showed more can kindness in the latter end than at the beginning in as much as you follow not what where the water or what do you see what boaz was watching roof do you see i want to see where your heart is if you after money or you after what let me see stay here and i'm gonna see so it's a stage that god tests your obedience in response to the love he sent towards you amen and the way you respond back to him that you love him is by keeping his commandment if you keep his commandment so you love me me and my father will come and we will manifest ourself to you and we will abide to you i cannot abide in you if you still loving somebody i'm a rich man i have a lot i cannot invest my stuff in a woman who doesn't love me i want to see your test why is boaz doing this number one it's a state that is the law must be mixed by revelation so you understand what god is doing for you number two it's an opportunity for you to show appreciation for everything he has done for you come and eat at the table come and drink give her food whatever she wants don't go anywhere there's so much he has done for you what do you do in return to him it's a test of obedience when i gave the commandment is she obeying yes or no if she obeys she loves me anybody okay this stage here is a stage all of this boaz is doing this in order to open anybody okay the door of your heart anybody clear that door is called self-will lord help me what are you saying brother amen the bible says love not the world neither the faiths that are in the water if any man love the world the love of the father is not what roof if you begin to go outside you don't love me no matter how much you can say you love me by your action i can tell whether you love me or not if you love the world this is why it's tough for the young people to get this because he's cutting the world off and they feel like they're cutting the fun out of us we need to go to we used to go to the soccer ball we used to go to the basketball we need to go i mean uh we use to go to the bowling alleys we used to hang out like this when you begin to enter sanctification boards begin to cut them off i don't want you to go there i don't want you to go there i don't want you to go there i don't want you to go there he's over he's not he's just observing you the holy ghost is not a gay man god don't put the holy ghost just like that everybody here for all that is in the world the last of the flesh the last of the earth the pride of life is not of the water but is of water so when you are embracing the world you coming out of the world you went to the present altar you give your life to jesus christ fine move forward let me take that first husband off of you because i can deal with him amen romans 12 i beseech you brethren therefore brethren by the mercies of god that he presents your water a living water i was already dead for you how an acceptable unto go which is a reasonable water everybody okay roof serving how do you serve present to your body holy amen hallelujah and be not conformed to this water but be [Music] oh god your time brother robert on wednesday but be transformed by the water which might need to be renewed your mind you already got this one you must renew yo anybody okay you must renew your mind the mind of the spirit must be anybody okay you must renew their mind this is not because the holy ghost is the mind of christ you don't renew the man of course you are renewing your mind he already giving you the new heart now we need to renew your spirit you need to be transformed but to be transformed you gotta cut the world off everybody okay by the renewing of your mind that she may prove what is what and what and what a perfect will of who this is what i want you to do i want you when you're going through this step at the end you will have a new spirit and me and you can start dealing certain secrets everybody okay so far so number one his faith must be connected if you don't understand you in prison opportunity for you to show your appreciation to what he did be thankful test to your obedience in response to the love he sent you and now he's doing all of this he's knocking at the door called self-will what is that door for brother branham on the east side he has only what is brother what i'm talking about what about he's talking about i believe i touch this in the old church everybody here we have the body you know that we have the spirit you know that and we have the right here we have five senses everybody care five senses you know them over here we have also five avenue everybody here anybody okay but over here there is only in the soul here there is only one gate anybody here you already passed this you are right here there is a door here that is called self oil everybody okay but branham say there is only one gate one interest to go into the water god is calling this she cannot glory because you are a tabernacle everybody here this is your other court everybody okay this is your holy place and this is your holiest this is your first pool that's why in the first pool brother branham have to touch you he must make contact with your body you remember this is your second pull that's why in the second pool by the branham doesn't touch you he contacts your spirit you okay now and now this is the turnpower [Music] did i lose somebody anybody okay so far all right okay hallelujah amen he said you want entrance to go into the chicana glory which is the holiest where god can enter into him and take over in the control tower god entering there means the baptism of the holy spirit and that way is through water whether you will to or not that is up to you but that is the only avenue that is open to the man that god can come into his what is by what puts him right back like adam and eve on a free moral agency again you can choose right or wrong either you want either one you want to ever care so god when he's showing you everything he's testing you he's backing at this door he want to see whether you want to accept or you want to reject let's go to the book of esther let's go to the book of esther i'm guild on tom for whoever he's wondering let's go to the book of esther hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord esther chapter 2 esther comes after nehemiah amen esther chapter two if you dare you can say amen verse three watch this carefully everybody okay and let the king appoint officer vaster did something that was wrong they kicked her out from being the queen now god need a new queen anybody okay now let the king appoint officer in all the provinces of his kingdom that they may gather together all the fair young virgins to shoot the palace to the house of the women to the custody of hagee the king's chamberlain you remember this in a hotel keeper of the women and let their fins for what for what do you know what it means can you say it loud number one you are a virgin living somewhere in the provinces maybe you're in south carolina you're in north carolina you're in colorado you you you in ohio everywhere that you are god is looking for wife number one go ahead and find the virgin when they pick you up and they bring you in justification everybody clear but you cannot face the king yet they never brought the virgin and took her say hey you came in let's go to the king king this is the virgin no no no no no no no the book of heaven when you come in you already justify but you're coming with a lot of stuff from where you're coming you're coming with your own culture your own tradition your own mindset your own preferences you coming they cannot make you enter to the king quickly you don't enter like that when you come in they need to give you certain stuff for purification amen everybody okay anybody okay verse 4 and let the maiden that water it's an opportunity for you to show appreciation by doing water everybody okay did i lose somebody let's go slowly and let the maiden which pleases the king remember that word pleases the queen pleases the king big queen instead of vaster and the thing pleased the king and he did so everybody okay job to verse eight so he came to pass when the king commandment and his decree was heard faith cometh by hearing and when many men then were gathered together in shushan the palace to the custody of hege everybody okay that esther was brought also to the king's house to the custody of hagar keeper of the water so esther was a bride among many women they brought here all of them justified amen but the king only is looking for one who's gonna get into the holy of holies that's the bride of jesus christ [Applause] if you reach the stage of hager everybody can brag about hagee i was there i know hey he's a good guy that doesn't make a difference that doesn't make you a queen you are only chosen as a candidate but you're not a queen yet do you see where he's picking up este [Music] everybody okay verse nine and the maiden please him and she obtained water for some reason when hey guy look at esther something struck his heart you didn't get it yet let me start it again when power saw roof [Applause] something struck boaz he begin to show all kind of kindness you know what when you're doing the drink you go ahead and get a drink if you hungry you go get it you you if she's working go ahead and give something what happened to this man what trouble him and the same thing happened to esther as soon as heather saw his side for some reason hegel begin to give kindness do you know that hey do you know that esther didn't have a father you know that right she didn't have a mother right so she was under the lineage of melchizedek [Music] everybody okay why was esther with that father and with that mother because there is somebody in the bible with their mother with that father his name was melchizedek [Applause] [Music] [Applause] my god we okay easy yummy do you need some salt or some pepper we good it's too easy it's good it's just the chef asking how do you like the food [Laughter] amen he said and the maiden verse 9 please him and she obtained water kindness of him and he speedily just like boasts quickly speedily gather have things for water because even esther cannot see the king she needs to be purified she needs to be sanctified and but here she was giving defense for purification even though she was a jew and the mordecai but she need to go through sanctification so whether you are born in the message and the mordecai or whether you are born outside of the message the process is still the same whether a jew esther whether another country or another province all of you same line same tabernacle everybody here praise god because some that born in the message will make you feel like you come from the world tell him that you you we are the roof [Applause] we are the one that can sing he took me out of the maori you cannot sing that one even the angel cannot sing it we understand amazing grace [Laughter] amen hallelujah he said and he speedily gave her the things for purification with such things as belong her everybody okay karma and water you have not caught it yet somebody caught when boys came and met roof he said roof i want you to remain with who [Music] any question have any question brother kalima you're having a good time at home my friend anybody here i'll meet you here and seven maintenance which one meet to be giving her and you brother greg you laughing and which maybe and which one meat to be giving her out of the king what the product of sanctification you don't bring it from your home it is provided by the king everybody okay and he prefer her esther and her mate to the water best place stop the house of the water why did it happen to esther everybody else you go there you go to 245 you go to 242. there is one special room you go this way sir i see everybody going this way you go this way [Applause] you want to copy everybody all the time go this way that's why in your life they used to catch you so much time [Music] somebody still no problem you tried to catch him it looks like every time you try something bad you are the one that's gonna be caught because you are a different species you are not meant for that [Applause] oh my god until the teacher knows if you want to know that you've caught that one because that one tremble the other one can kill somebody and they're fine everybody here you remember the men had the the fifa the cross when the other one was mocking he was a thief a bad man a murderer but he have enough says to say why can you say something like this we are guilty how does he have that conscience in the cross why is he different than the other one that's why jesus pulled his binocular quickly he looked he said there is a predestinated seat come on me and you we're going at the very last minute jesus pick him up [Music] this scripture you are the one pulling i'm trying to move forward anybody here first uh verse 10 we were on verse nine jump to verse 12 so we can get something now every maid turn was come to go into the king after that she had been water 12 months you got to stay two a month what a sanctification you were happy oh praise the lord i'm gonna be the queen i'm gonna be the queen you get there they slow the process they put you under somebody what is going on you don't go outside if you want to be the queen you're going to stay in this harem of women under the custody of hagee you're going nowhere so what happened you're going to go through purification how long 12 months oh i thought this was you come today you get tomorrow you see the king they gotta take some of the stuff out everybody okay everybody okay 12 months come on according to the manner of women for so were the days of their purification accompli you must complete the full circle of sanctification that is six months with water oil of water six months somebody speaking somebody's picking up everybody okay six months of water which means what death six months they're killing you continue to preach the black dog black dog black dog black dog [Laughter] everybody okay anybody okay after you go through that so this process that's why i say if you don't have a revelation you're gonna be feeling like you put in a prison because they justify you you are the head you're not going nowhere you are restricted you can't go anywhere and as you are restricted they begin to kill yes no you wake up in the morning man you wake up in the morning you say what is going on when are you gonna change the sermon my friend you

[Applause] the man doesn't kill you it kills the other stuff that are on you but the way we usually behave it's like we're getting killed lack of revelation everybody okay let's go six months with water with water those order must be sweet so at the beginning killing killing killing killing killing when they see that you really reach six months they say change then they begin to give something else another treatment another treatment after a while you become sweet [Music] you become sweet after a while you become sweet but here and back here when it begin to tender you to make you sweet you're getting ready now to go see the king amen amen anybody okay praise god he says sweet others and with other things for the purifying of the water of the women verse 13 and i'm gonna jump quickly then thus came every maiden to the king whatsoever she does what she desire was giving her to go with her out of the house of the water and to the king's water got the treatment got everything take what you want we want to see if the process work we want to see if it really works everybody okay you finish the treatment yes praise god go ahead and take what you want choose what you want use your self-will again [Music] amen amen go ahead and use yourself with again do it again the way you were doing before you disqualified anybody here when you finish they say you finish tomorrow is your day to the king who praise the lord finally i'm gonna say the king they say you know one thing you can pick everything you want you can go to the king guess what and some begin to think over you know what when in the country that i came in the state that i came women usually have to to to do this no no let me do maybe something like this and the king when he sees me it's gone go ahead and take it go ahead and take it go ahead and take it this is when you see after preaching high heels after preaching against women wearing nails after preaching against all this haircut and everything you see sisters in this church still doing the same thing over they don't want to take their nails off they don't want to take the high heel off they don't want to take the touches off they're still stubborn around it you're not stubborn against me you are stubborn against the one who's trying to fill you with the holy spirit because you went through the process and still you are persistent to certain things that's fine now go see the king and you will understand what i was preaching about amen amen verse 14 and in the evening she went and on the mall she returned in the second house of the women to the custody of shasta the king chamberlain which kept the water if you missed your opportunity you're going to the concubine you're going to be purged by tribulation [Music] everybody okay because god is opening the tabernacle you don't play a game with it everybody here jump to verse 15. now when the turn of esther the daughter of abigail abigail the uncle of modica who had taken her for his daughter was come to go into the king she required what nothing but what who thank god everybody okay when i met this man the first time he loved me amen he treated me different he put me in the best room here i must follow his instruction esther go ahead and pick up everything you want she said no again again me picking up you've been working you've been doing this job for a long time you tell me what the king want ever here it was a taste of self-will to see if you're gonna take yourself well down and you begin to depend on the leadership of somebody else to lead you through the kingdom when he can look he say no one day i love you the first day i saw you come open that closet over there take that one take that one this one here just take that one this one yes take that one another king take that one go ahead and go everybody here everybody here everybody here verse 17. so and the 16th so esther no let's go to verse 15. appointed in the king chamberlain the keeper of the women appointed an esta obtained what in the sight of all them that look upon she was under a candlestick which was heggy the messenger and she followed them instruction from the messenger of her time and when she applied the instruction from the messenger of the time who has the program of the king as soon as as they entered the king the king look and say hey i understood the signal this is the one in other words and the king were communicating by the dressing of hager was telling the king above all the women this is the one i have tested and i found out that she has a character the king doesn't have to think twice because hager is giving him instruction by the dressing of esther the word that you have that's why brother branham said at the day of the rapture when we go to heaven we will have the message of the hour put it like this as we go into heaven so as you enter into heaven god doesn't look at your wrist he doesn't look at your color he doesn't look at your heart he doesn't look at how big you are or how leader you are all god is trying to see is the message of the hour when i see the message of the hour that's my brother go ahead and go personal go ahead and enter that's why it's better to follow the instruction of the message [Applause] hallelujah this message is not putting you in prison this message is a message of preparation preparing you to enter and to meet the king the lord of [Applause] lords oh my god where am i at brother robert few minutes rather kelly brother what i'm saying it comes to this little jewish girl she was rather a kind of an outcast because like the gender you see she was cast off to one side she had no father no mother under the lineage of melchizedek and mordecai her uncle was raising her and she had to go to qualify justification and what so and and so what did what they did they had to take these girls in for water for so many months they had to perfume them and do all kind of adorning and fix them all up so they could go before there you understand this now but go ahead esther was to become a brother so she didn't want none of the adorning of the if you love the world and the things of the world the love of god is not even in water that's why we're preaching against those staff we're not taking your liberty off anybody okay she wanted to go in to the king she like just like she was she adorned herself like the pentecostal women ought to we for what everybody okay meek and humble spirit and when all these fancy first lady comes by with all the fandango things the king looked at them and put them in the chamber with the concubine but when this esta come into his side and he got a water of that water and water and make water renew by your mind renewing by the man by the purification everybody he said that's him go get the water and put it on water that's it let them adorn themselves with that kind of spirit not only the women but the water the men too the brothers too adorn themselves with that kind of a spirit then you are becoming ready for the water how and what esther made her hurt god calls you as individual and it's you that's got to clean up because he's taking a people from the gentile for his name sick his brother agenda esther did want water she cleaned her heart that is what she cleaned that is what the church need a hot water how do you get your how do you clean your heart brother branham [Applause] wash by the water off the water through the blood of water sanctification through the blood by the washing of the water by the water so when we preach something here pay attention obey and listen take your high heel off even if you like it don't worry about the desire apply the word and begin to confess that i don't like high heel anymore [Music] take your earring off take your mail off young sister leave your nail natural [Music] take the stat dress off young men have a nice haircut remove all the crazy haircut [Applause] you will love me one day you want to get the holy ghost you want to get the holy ghost you want to get the holy ghost that's why when elijah asked for a double potion did elijah tell him you are asking something easy he said you're asking something hard because the holy ghost is god himself entering and staying in you god cannot enter a grandma clean vessel hallelujah brother branham esther purge her heart before god walk up with a mick and a humble spirit the church that is going to be the bread of jesus christ now remember esther refused the water she took the spirit in her heart to go before the king it is a sweet kind reverent spirit to the water watch who you're rebelling against [Music] but here you're now rebelling against me you're rebelling against the word the word that is trying to prove you the word that is trying to test you the word that is trying to make sure you are clean up completely so he can put his seal and say now i believe your faith and now i see that you love me abraham i see that you love me above your children above your job above your desire above the world above my above daddy above anybody you love me go ahead from now on abraham i mean blessing our blessing [Applause] it's a test my friend it's a sweep it's a reverent spirit to the word of god watch by the water of the world and the word in you it's a washing the church need a water a full gospel that's why not just a part watching no brother stephen you preach about this but this one i don't see anything wrong about it what you think you don't see anything wrong about it it is not a word did you believe moses you would have believed me amen because you don't know god's will god's will is revealed through his prophet and his prophet is telling you that save the lord do this as unreasonable as it seems but the problem is the desire of your love you love to show your friends so much that you are not these kind of message believers i'm a little bit moderate you want to be a little bit cool so that you can look warm so that you can fit with your friend and then you can fit with the message believer [Music] go listen go listen to the souls in prison what can the women brother branham found in in hell and look at what you're doing to your body present your body a living water did he talk to you about the high heel is your high heel making you sexy is it a living sacrifice is your big long nail a living sacrifice is your earring in the exactly class is the way you dress putting your pants down a living sacrifice a tight pant a living sacrifice have to go through the legalistic not to kill you it's a purification in order to renew you got to get some discipline you got to fix your character you got to go through some dying you got to take certain things off of your life and after a while you will see as long as you take you take you see the treatment begin to change and then you begin to sober and then you begin to act differently and then you're not acting like the way you used before just know they changed the treatment now you are in sweet orders anybody okay that is right not just a part washing but the full gospel water clean up made new creature in water jesus brad is not a dirty brother he will not have a dirty bread if a woman come up to get married and she looked like she come out of a pig pen she's in justification out there a man that is got any dignity about him would not marry her he'd make her clean herself up and when the church of christ come up to get married think she's going to be the bra in the brad with all the world water onto her crossbred won't be like that you got to go through the purification of 12 months 12 you reach the number of worship then you're ready to enter into the holiest everybody okay so far amen i gotta stop here because if i continue i'm gonna get into a different territory anybody care praise be the name of the lord i just went eight minutes over everybody remember rufunda legalistic rufundo legalistic if you don't understand this stage you will think that you are in a prison you will think that we're taking all the fun of you young people we cannot go to the ball we cannot do this we cannot do this we cannot do it looks like there is no fun there is fun but not your way your kind of fun before you look for fun get clean up first seek ye first the kingdom of god make sure you have the holy ghost when you have the holy ghost then you can then you can continue your life at that point i'm not going to be there to watch you what you're doing somebody will be there to tell you what to do or what not to do you don't go after the benefit without the holy spirit because when they give you the benefit you're going to run away from god you need to seek first the kingdom of god oh we need fun before you get fun make sure you get the holy ghost when you get the holy ghost then i will tell you go get fun and i will see what kind of fan you're going to get because the holy ghost is a power more more than you he can even paralyze you anybody here if you don't understand this state brother stephen will be like a hard preacher we're not a hard preacher we're just trying to get the devil out of you how do i get the devil out of me i must keep the commandment of god as simple as it is what do you want me to do you want me to take this haircut off no problem lord i'm going to the barbershop tomorrow god changed my haircut you change your haircut not because brother stephen said in obedience to god that i love you and die for you if you change the haircut you are engaging god in your life god have to remove whatever spirit was troubling you hey but here if you you are struggling with tight dress you don't understand you want to look always sexy don't worry take the church dress in a legalistic way not because of her because of love because i want to show appreciation i want to please him he's testing my obedience i need to send him a signal that i love you if this if taking my tat dress off will please you and i want to get married to you i'm going to take my tight dress off because my thought dress off cannot be compared to the marriage you're trying to give me when i went to your marriage and this this is nothing if you take that off god comes and remove the desire of your life this is the legalistic work that you do take your nail off i love it it looks good that's what people tells me i'm gonna go i say mama go ahead uh chinese lady take the nails off you take the nails off when the nails are off you say god i did this because of you i'm gonna be natural because of you and you will see what god are what he's gonna do sometimes the blockage in your life in other area comes from disobedient in certain area hey but here and you are starving you are you are praying you are fasting you're trying to see god what is going on why is this blocking why is this working to take devils out of your life the easiest way is by obedience obedience applying the word in appreciation to what he did for you and then you move on even if you're still struggling with it don't worry about do what he said to do he will take over take the stone and shoot it he will pick up the stone and do it go to the priest as long as you're turning going to the priest he will remove whatever is troubling you because you are showing him that i love you more than that i love you more than this i love you more than this i love you more than this first of all you could not go to church but you force yourself to say god i cannot stay like this because i love you i'm gonna rise and go to church the first day you go to church tired you come to church you feel better next wednesday you go to church tired you go to church you feel better fourth wednesday fifth wednesday after a while you will notice like your system is working now automatically on wednesday when it's wednesday something is already preparing you you need to go to work even if you sleep you will see at a certain time around five o'clock you sleep like your eyes open he is the one that already took over because you obey him before you know it wednesday going to church his life it is no more a burden at the beginning he was a burden but when you did your part when you work out your own salvation when you acted upon what he tells you to do then he's gonna come and give you grace to overcome whatever you are overcoming everybody here so don't sit down and say oh i need to take time until i get the revelation to remove this no you don't have to wait for the revelation to remove this just do it in a legalistic way according to the word in appreciation to him and you begin to confess you say you know what i used to wear bad dresses but god delivered me from it when you begin to confess like that he looks he said hey go remove it because when he put you on the head he is protecting you heger usually are unique they cannot do anything to women that's why when groove entered boaz went and blocked the reapers because the esther must be protected and the men that are there but cannot touch them reapers that are there but cannot touch roof stay with the maiden follow the maiden they know what i'm doing they already know my laws they know how i operate just make go go with the maiden they go to the left associate with the people that believe like you roof you just knew you don't know

didn't follow this need to follow her i won't have your blood in my hand this message is not a legalistic according to what you heard legalistic like prison it is not like that it is only a channel a time of purification everybody here a time of purification that god wants to take the world out of you so that you can meet him because you cannot enter into the imagine the holy place is called already holy place that where god is is called the holiest now in the holy place you're not clean how are you going to enter the holiest where the the the because over there you have the caribbean and the caribbean cannot even look at god and they never seen in their life they have to cover their face cover their feet cover everything just to see the holiness of god how about you coming up with all kinds of dirty stuff and trying to get into the holiest you're going to get killed that's why the high priest himself when he was entering he was trembling because if he play game and something is not covered the high priest is dead and nobody even entered to take him off you got to pull him from there outside and get him off how are you going to enter there but the blood of jesus christ already ripped the veil and made the way for you to enter all that he said he's telling you to do the sanctification of the spirit by obedience into the sprinkling of the water man take your bracelet off we already preached to you after that take that internet stuff off remove all the stuff you're doing on the internet clean up your life you want to get the holy ghost clean up your life because sanctification means to clean and set aside for the feeling to be used in service i want the holy ghost i want the holy ghost but you don't want to let go you want the holy ghost and continue the way you are living god will never give you the holy ghost you got to give away your friends you got to give away your association you got to give away all your facebook sometimes you got to close even that facebook stuff because it caused you a lot of trouble all that knows you on you on on on what uh facebook you are just a player yes we know you here as a brother over there they know you a player they don't have any record of you being a message believer all you doing there is no different than them get it off my friend get it off you want to dance he will show you how to death get the spirit you would this let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly tonight father thanking you for your grace father for your love and for everything you are doing for us father i trust and i pray that your children especially the young understand and get the revelation on what you are trying to tell them father this world is gone insane [Music] until parent would leave their children to go to school and the next phone calls they're calling them to come and pick up dead bodies nonsense that was shoot they were shot they didn't even know what they did and father sometimes you speaking to your children and we walk out like we're gonna stay here for a thousand years again not even knowing when is the next time you're gonna call us you keep knocking at the door and we're coming out of the church and continue to behave continue smoking continue drinking continue tempering with that girlfriend of the world continue in that stubbornness way do not want to listen continue with that reasoning i don't see anything wrong with this continue with this thing that is that are keeping you away from the church and before you know it people are cooling off they miss one service they miss two services they miss three services before you know it it's month before you know it it's a year accumulating all the things of this world and neglecting their soul while all the symptoms the war of russia that we thought in three days or four days could be finished now the war is driving until united states is suffering to even have baby formula milk who would have thought we will come in a time that inflation will rise up in this nation like this who would have thought we will reach a place where we have to pay the gas for our car in the pricing that we paint and despite all this sign some are still stubborn until you spoke you say stubbornness is like idolatry stubbornness [Music] it's like iniquity iniquity because somebody is still esteeming something higher than you somebody's still giving preeminence to whatever they want to cling to above what your word is saying they want to gain the material of this world they want to fulfill their dream first before they start coming to church and they don't know what tomorrow will be those children that were shot those two men that were shot did not know that was their last day to attend school father may your children wake up make those that are streaming online wake up make those that one listen to this sermon wake up and remember that the calling of the master is calling for the last call so that we can enter in and surrender and obey and be filled with the holy spirit and be ready to go into the rapture lord may you be merciful to us may you give enough grace so that the revelation will be unfolded that they can catch their vision and realize this is not a man talking this is the very mercies of god calling and asking to surrender not for prison but you just want to see an obedience because the purpose that you have is to bless them is to see them and to give them an expected end because the thoughts you have for them are not talks of evil but it's taught to kill to do them good to bless them to deliver them to give them a wonderful marriage to give them a wonderful job to bless them but how can you do that when they don't give you preeminence may they surrender that stubborn self-will that is always on the way don't want to go to church don't want to go to prayer service don't want to go to the things that belong to kingdom don't want to go to the question and answer oh they want to go is in different places father i'm pleading as a shepherd that father you'll be merciful and may you help your children there is enough an abundance of holy ghost that you want to fill them father the door has been already open and it's a simple instruction just obey and the holy spirit will come lord we commit them unto the hand may you continue to reveal your word unto them and may you continue to work and and further strengthen them and may you take the remaining of the weak unto the hand and father this oncoming service that is coming up on the weekend with brother abraham that he might be surrendering himself and moving out of the way and may you speak again and bless your children we commit them unto the hand and we thank you in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you church we love you but [Music] thou be [Music] [Applause] [Music] let's take it one more time [Music] to be a sanctuary [Music] with [Music] that you were [Music] more [Music]
