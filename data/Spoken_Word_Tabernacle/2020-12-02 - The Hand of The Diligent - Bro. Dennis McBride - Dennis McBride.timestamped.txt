[3:04] trusteth in him. Oh, fear the Lord, ye
[3:07] his saints, for there is no lack to them
[3:11] that fear him. The young lions do lack
[3:15] and suffer hunger,
[3:17] but they that seek the Lord shall not
[3:20] lack any good thing." Amen. Let's stand

[34:01] sermon is confirmed
[34:03] Amen.
[34:06] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[34:09] Hallelujah.
[34:11] If you don't know what an anointing is,
[34:14] just learn from what you see in this
[34:16] church.
[34:17] Sometime it will strike you like power.
[34:20] Sometime it's sweet calm, but it's
[34:23] moving powerfully.
[34:24] Amen. Sometime it might make you fall
[34:27] down. Sometime it will make you cry or
[34:30] shout. All of that add the different
[34:32] flavor
[34:34] of the anointing of the Holy Spirit.
[34:36] I believe everybody including those
[34:38] online got a text for the oncoming
[34:41] meeting. You have any question? The
[34:44] trustees, the deacons, sister L'Oreal
[34:46] and everybody else. Amen.
[34:49] Praise the name of the Lord. Brother
[34:51] Elijah sent me I believe it's him. He

[35:00] Sister Becky, have a baby girl. Amen.
[35:11] So, we had Gabriela, we had Onyx,
[35:14] Brother Paul, and daughter. Now, it's
[35:16] Ivana.

[35:23] Mom and baby are doing great by God's
[35:26] grace. didn't have a chance to talk to
[35:28] them, but Lord's willing, after service,
[35:30] we will be talking to them. But praise
[35:32] the Lord, he's adding more. Amen.
[35:36] Blessed be the name of the Lord. I was
[35:38] studying and meditating for the oncoming
[35:41] Sunday if Jesus Terry to come. Amen.
[35:47] Yeah, I know we already established the
[35:49] problem between Mori and Esther. Now we
[35:52] have the background where that battle
[35:54] started from Amalcch and now we need to
[35:57] get into the banquet of Esther. What is
[36:00] going on with the two banquet of Esther?
[36:03] If you want to read it, it's Esther
[36:05] chapter 5
[36:07] and Esther chapter 7. Esther chapter 6
[36:11] is just in between the two which is the
[36:14] revelation of the son of man where Morci
[36:17] used the king's horse the king's uh
[36:21] apparel to reveal the kings to the
[36:24] public. Morci was not the king but he
[36:27] was a son of man revealing this son of
[36:30] man to the public. Amen. When you look
[36:34] it's like Christ but it's not Christ. It
[36:36] is Mori. The king is in the palace in
[36:39] between in between
[36:42] Esther chapter 5 and chapter 7. Chapter
[36:46] 5 is the first banquet. Chapter 7 is the
[36:48] second banquet. In between those two
[36:51] banquet, you have the revelation of the
[36:53] son of man which is the second pool
[36:56] because it's a discernment.
[36:58] Amen.
[36:59] So I don't know we need to work where
[37:02] the the other two pools are. Amen. Now
[37:05] you begin to work. Praise the name of
[37:08] the Lord. I'm now going to put brother
[37:09] MBR in trouble. Amen. Brother McBride is
[37:13] with us here. He's a caliber minister.
[37:16] The last time he ministered for us, he
[37:18] was wonderful. And usually we don't have
[37:21] visitors here. I just told him outside.
[37:24] He's a home. Have your liberty. Preach
[37:27] the house down like your home. Amen.
[37:31] So you know MBR already. I know him
[37:33] since the old church. You already know
[37:35] him here. He's a wonderful minister,
[37:37] wonderful spirit, and a servant of the
[37:39] Lord. So, we're going to invite him
[37:41] tonight, and he's going to take his
[37:42] liberty and preach what the Lord have in
[37:44] his heart for this church.
[37:47] Amen.
[37:49] Only believe.
[37:51] Well, only
[37:55] believe.

[39:20] Lord. I
[39:26] Amen. Let us all bow together.
[39:29] And as we bow, let us be mindful that
[39:32] we're bowing before a living God
[39:36] who is here right now.
[39:39] Thank you, Lord.
[39:40] And before we even ask, he already
[39:42] knows.
[39:43] [Music]
[39:47] But he's able to do all things.
[39:50] So let's approach him in confidence.
[39:53] Heavenly Father,
[39:57] we say thank you, Lord, for allowing
[39:59] each one of us to be able to gather here
[40:01] tonight.
[40:05] It's by your grace, Father,
[40:08] that you preserve us on a daily basis.
[40:14] You protect us, Lord, from more than
[40:16] what we realize.
[40:18] [Music]
[40:20] So all we can say right now is thank
[40:22] you.
[40:24] Thank you for your protection. Thank you
[40:27] for your love.
[40:28] Thank you.
[40:29] Thank you Lord God for the many
[40:31] provisions
[40:34] Lord that you provide for us constantly.
[40:38] We ask tonight, Lord, that you would
[40:40] have your way.
[40:43] You know your people, Father. You know
[40:44] what their needs are.
[40:49] God, we pray that you would come and
[40:50] satisfy those needs. And we know that
[40:53] you already are here
[40:56] to do that, Father.
[40:58] We're only trying, Lord, to humble
[41:00] ourselves, Father, to you
[41:02] that you might be able to have your way.
[41:07] Bless your word, Lord God.
[41:09] Amen.
[41:10] Bless every soul that's here.
[41:12] Yes, Lord.
[41:14] Whatever thoughts might be in our minds
[41:18] that might possibly be a work of the
[41:20] enemy to distract us, Lord, we pray that
[41:23] you would help us in that way.
[41:26] that our thoughts would be gathered from
[41:27] every other thing
[41:30] and be able to settle upon you Lord God
[41:32] in expectation
[41:35] knowing Lord God that you move in that
[41:37] kind of a way. Father your prophet
[41:39] taught us that we get what we expect
[41:42] Lord help us now we ask
[41:45] in the mighty name of our Lord and
[41:47] Savior Jesus Christ we ask these things
[41:49] and we pray. Amen.
[41:52] Amen.
[41:53] Amen. God bless you saints.
[41:56] Amen. It's good to be here by the grace
[41:58] of God.
[42:00] Amen.
[42:02] Praise God. Thank brother Stephen for
[42:06] the invitation.
[42:08] Amen. We always uh we've always
[42:10] appreciated him and his life and his
[42:13] ministry and just the consistency of
[42:16] what I've always seen in him. Whenever I
[42:18] saw him, he was always the same.
[42:20] Amen. And we appreciate that, don't we?
[42:23] Amen.
[42:25] So we thank God for him. Amen. And
[42:28] brother Kelly, saw him in the back.
[42:29] Brother Carlos, there many names I don't
[42:32] know right off, but God bless each one
[42:34] of you.
[42:36] Amen. In our Bibles, I don't want to
[42:39] keep you standing long.
[42:43] In our Bibles, let's turn to Proverbs
[42:45] chapter 10.
[42:52] Proverbs chapter 10.
[42:58] You have to excuse me as far as my
[43:01] family not being here. Um but for the
[43:05] ministering brethren uh you know the
[43:08] weight that comes along with uh the
[43:11] ministering of the word
[43:13] and
[43:15] it's it's very important as far as that
[43:17] time that you have prior to a servicemen
[43:21] and uh especially when you work a a job
[43:24] and things of that nature. you're coming
[43:26] from different environments and
[43:27] different atmospheres and you know uh
[43:31] you just need to kind of get quiet and
[43:34] get settled.
[43:35] Yes sir.
[43:36] I thank God for my family and I love
[43:38] them. Uh but you know children to be
[43:41] children and and sometimes you know just
[43:45] the different conversations and things
[43:47] around it can just kind of I don't know
[43:51] it can kind of disturb things a little
[43:54] bit. Uh-huh.
[43:55] Um, so it's for me I find it best that I
[43:58] I I be able just to to have real quiet
[44:01] time.
[44:02] Yes, sir.
[44:03] Just so I can clear my mind and just
[44:05] meditate.
[44:06] I don't even turn on the radio or unless
[44:10] it's a particular sermon the Lord has me
[44:13] uh listening to. I may listen to a
[44:15] sermon, but for the most part, it's
[44:17] complete silence.
[44:19] That's just how I am.
[44:22] I took a trip um
[44:25] where was I going? I think I was going
[44:26] to Virginia
[44:29] and after about 6 hours I realized man
[44:32] you hadn't turned on the radio or
[44:33] nothing. I was just lost in thought
[44:37] and I was just satisfied you know I'm a
[44:40] deep thinker.
[44:42] So uh that that's just how I am.
[44:45] Amen. But nonetheless, my family is
[44:47] doing well by the grace of God and and I
[44:49] just ask for your prayers continually
[44:51] for us.
[44:52] Amen.
[44:53] Amen. Okay. Proverbs chapter 10. Let's
[44:57] go to verse 4.
[45:00] Proverbs 10 and verse 4.
[45:05] It says, "He becometh poor that dealth
[45:08] with a slack hand,
[45:10] but the hand of the diligent
[45:12] Yes, sir.
[45:13] maketh rich." Amen.
[45:16] Verse five says, "He that gatherth in
[45:19] summer is a wise son,
[45:22] but he that sleepeth in harvest is a son
[45:25] that causes shame."
[45:28] Amen. Let's bow once more. Heavenly
[45:30] Father, we've read your word.
[45:32] Please help us, Lord.
[45:34] Hallelujah.
[45:34] We ask this in the name of our Lord and
[45:36] Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.
[45:39] God bless you, saints. You may be
[45:41] seated.
[45:51] Amen. I know you all have been eating
[45:53] well here.
[45:56] Amen. Uh,
[45:58] Brother Steven just gave me a little
[46:00] appetizer back there.
[46:03] You know, before you eat a main meal,
[46:04] you have an appetizer. Yeah,
[46:07] I'm not going to be able to be here for
[46:08] the main meal, but I got a little
[46:10] appetizer from what he expressed,
[46:13] what was on his heart, and that was
[46:15] appreciated. Amen.
[46:18] Amen. He's a real teacher.
[46:20] Praise God.
[46:25] I'm not going to try to cover
[46:27] everything, of course, tonight,
[46:29] especially with it being a a Wednesday
[46:31] night. I just pray the Lord help me just
[46:35] to kind of be sensitive to his spirit
[46:38] so I can just move with him
[46:42] because that's what it's all about.
[46:45] Amen. It's there's many things that
[46:47] could be ministered on. Um and even even
[46:51] tonight I was just continuing to pray in
[46:54] the back that this was the Lord's will.
[46:57] So be in prayer with me.
[46:59] Amen.
[46:59] Got the Lord to help us tonight.
[47:02] Hallelujah.
[47:03] I'm going to read those two verses
[47:05] again.
[47:05] Amen.
[47:07] Says, "He becometh poor that dealeth
[47:09] with a slack hand,
[47:11] but the hand of the diligent maketh
[47:14] rich."
[47:16] He that gatherth in summer is a wise
[47:18] son, but he that sleepeth in harvest is
[47:21] a son that causes shame.
[47:25] So throughout all the scriptures of
[47:27] course especially here
[47:29] um God he's expressing himself
[47:34] you know he's expressing his views and
[47:36] his thoughts
[47:38] toward many different things
[47:41] this up just a little higher. Praise the
[47:44] Lord. Sorry.
[47:47] Thank you brother.
[47:49] Amen.
[47:49] Amen.
[47:50] All right. Yes, sir.
[47:52] But he's he expresses himself, you know,
[47:56] so many times the way that he expresses
[47:58] himself is hard for people to catch it.
[48:02] And of course, it's not intended to be
[48:04] caught with a natural mind.
[48:06] Amen.
[48:07] Um it really takes God being able to
[48:10] help a person to understand.
[48:12] Um him doing that, you won't understand.
[48:15] You can look right at it, but it remain
[48:17] closed.
[48:17] That's right.
[48:18] You know, it'll remain sealed. Yes, sir.
[48:21] He has to take the seal off
[48:23] to help us to understand. So,
[48:27] he's saying what he's saying here and
[48:29] he's using the examples that he's that
[48:31] he's using. But these things are very
[48:34] important to him.
[48:35] Yes, sir.
[48:36] There's one thing about God. Um,
[48:40] whatever we see him speaking about,
[48:42] come on. uh in in in relation to how he
[48:45] desires a person to be. He's not asking
[48:48] any more of us than what he's what than
[48:52] what he is himself.
[48:55] Amen.
[48:56] So what he asked of us is what he
[48:59] actually is.
[49:01] Yes, sir.
[49:02] He's the manifestation of the very word
[49:04] that he speaks to us.
[49:06] Isn't that right?
[49:08] So here he's talking about diligence.
[49:11] Yes, sir. Hallelujah.
[49:12] Now, how many know that God is very
[49:14] diligent?
[49:15] Yes, sir.
[49:16] Amen. He's not slack.
[49:19] The Bible says that he's not slack
[49:21] concerning his promises.
[49:24] Amen. If he said something, he means it
[49:26] and he'll do it.
[49:28] Amen.
[49:29] Amen.
[49:29] But God is showing something here. He's
[49:31] showing the difference between two
[49:33] different things here because because he
[49:35] himself is diligent.
[49:37] So that's his desire for his people
[49:39] also. Amen.
[49:40] Now, I want to say this on the front
[49:42] end.
[49:43] It's within every one of us to be
[49:45] diligent.
[49:47] For every child of God, it's within the
[49:49] sea. It's already in the seed.
[49:52] Amen.
[49:53] It's just a matter of us getting into
[49:55] the right atmosphere.
[49:58] That God can draw out of us what he's
[50:00] already placed in us.
[50:02] So, as I'm speaking on this tonight,
[50:04] don't look at it as something
[50:06] far-fetched or something that has to
[50:08] come to you. is already on the inside of
[50:10] you.
[50:12] It's just a matter of God bringing it
[50:14] out. See, well, once we see the need for
[50:16] something, then we can humble ourselves
[50:19] to him according to that particular
[50:20] thing.
[50:21] We can cry out to him. We can seek him
[50:23] for that.
[50:25] How many How many How many can say amen
[50:27] to that?
[50:28] So, tonight by the grace of God, I want
[50:30] to deal with the subject of the hand of
[50:33] the diligent.
[50:35] Amen.
[50:36] Amen. The hand of the diligent. Yes sir.
[50:39] Um just looking at natural life,
[50:42] right? When we see anybody attain
[50:46] anything significant,
[50:49] right? Uh
[50:52] all of us in here I I don't re raise
[50:55] your hand if you desire to be poor.
[50:59] Raise
[51:01] your hand if you don't desire to have a
[51:04] a better uh maybe standard of life than
[51:08] what you currently have.
[51:12] That means you're content,
[51:14] right?
[51:17] Amen. So, you're content. Well, I'm not
[51:20] content.
[51:21] Amen. And I'm I'm not content with the
[51:23] the uh the I'm not content with where
[51:26] what with with what I've achieved so
[51:29] far.
[51:29] Yes, Lord.
[51:30] I'm not satisfied.
[51:32] And I'm not satisfied where I'm are
[51:34] spiritually where I am spiritually or
[51:36] naturally.
[51:38] Amen. There is a desire within me. Amen.
[51:40] To to have more.
[51:42] You know, I have a family, right?
[51:44] I see families within here, little
[51:46] children and whatever. Any parent wants
[51:48] more for their children.
[51:51] Even if you had it hard coming up. Amen.
[51:54] You don't want your children to have to
[51:56] deal with the same battles
[51:58] and the same issues that you did when
[52:00] you came up.
[52:02] So within the heart of any parent, you
[52:04] desire to see your children have better
[52:07] than what you had. Isn't that right?
[52:10] Amen. But now notice anybody that
[52:12] achieves anything in this life that that
[52:14] achieves any levels of of success,
[52:18] amen, they they have to develop certain
[52:20] habits.
[52:21] Yes, my brother.
[52:23] Because B your habits determine your
[52:25] results.
[52:26] Yes, my brother.
[52:27] How many understand that?
[52:29] Yes, sir.
[52:30] Your habits determine your results.
[52:32] Yes, my brother.
[52:33] Amen. As myself, you know, I I desire to
[52:36] get in better shape and what have you.
[52:37] I'm 44 now. I ain't getting no younger,
[52:40] you know. So, I'm like, I need to start
[52:42] getting this thing right while I still
[52:44] can.
[52:45] Amen. So, my mind now is toward just
[52:48] getting better in shape overall just for
[52:50] me, just for better health.
[52:52] Amen. But now, how would that be
[52:54] achieved?
[52:57] Yes, sir.
[52:58] I can have that desire all day long. I
[53:01] can talk about it and speak to other
[53:03] like right now, I'm telling you, I want
[53:05] to be better in health. I want to be in
[53:07] better shape and things of that nature.
[53:12] But what's going to bring me into that?
[53:14] Yes, sir.
[53:18] Yes, sir.
[53:20] My dayto-day steps,
[53:22] my day-to-day decisions,
[53:24] my day-to-day actions,
[53:27] if that's a goal that I set,
[53:30] Uhhuh.
[53:31] then what's the road that's going to
[53:32] take me there?
[53:35] Now, it comes back to what I'm talking
[53:36] about tonight. In order for me to be
[53:38] able to achieve the goals that I have
[53:40] for myself personally, it's going to
[53:43] take diligence.
[53:45] Yes, sir.
[53:47] Hallelujah.
[53:47] Amen.
[53:48] If I if I exercise once every month,
[53:54] that's going to determine how quickly I
[53:57] get my results.
[53:59] Isn't that right? Yeah.
[54:01] But if I exercise once a month, but yet
[54:03] I'm saying I want to be able to get in
[54:05] shape, then what am I doing in sense?
[54:09] I'm approaching the situation slackly.
[54:15] Isn't that right? And based upon how I'm
[54:17] approaching it, that's what's
[54:19] determining what results I get.
[54:22] That's what determines how quickly I
[54:24] reach my goal or how long it takes for
[54:26] me to get there.
[54:29] Amen.
[54:30] Amen.
[54:31] It's based upon the diligence. Amen. But
[54:33] what bring? Now listen now. Normally if
[54:36] a person goes to a doctor,
[54:39] the doctor lets them know, listen,
[54:42] your health is borderline. You
[54:44] borderline diabetic.
[54:45] Uhhuh.
[54:46] You need to lose some weight. You need
[54:48] to cut back on your sugars. You need to
[54:49] be able to do whatever, whatever,
[54:50] whatever. If not,
[54:52] yes,
[54:53] this is going to be the result. Ah,
[54:56] normally a report like that will do
[54:58] what?
[55:00] Amen. That's exactly right, my brother.
[55:03] It'll it'll cause a person to now have a
[55:07] have a purpose and an enthusiasm
[55:11] about getting that health in line more
[55:14] than what it was before
[55:16] because daddy realize if I don't do
[55:18] this, my health is going to be in
[55:20] jeopardy
[55:21] and overall I can lose my life.
[55:26] Isn't that right?
[55:27] Yes, sir.
[55:27] So, it takes many times certain things
[55:30] to happen in some cases
[55:32] to drive a person to the level of
[55:35] diligence
[55:37] that they need in order to be able to
[55:39] achieve a certain thing.
[55:42] Can we say amen to that?
[55:45] Normally, if there's no pressure,
[55:47] there's no urgency.
[55:53] Very seldom you very seldom you see
[55:56] anybody with enough discipline
[55:59] to be able to stay with something. Amen.
[56:02] And then chop away at it on a day-to-day
[56:04] basis. Amen. Have a have a schedule,
[56:07] have a structure, h have some kind of a
[56:09] plan.
[56:10] Listen, saints that they stick to.
[56:17] There are many people that admire his
[56:19] name is what? Jeff Bezos.
[56:23] He's the owner of Amazon.
[56:24] Yes, sir. Lord,
[56:26] I wouldn't mind having this money.
[56:29] Amen.
[56:30] Praise the Lord. But I was noticing
[56:32] something about people that attain
[56:34] certain things in this life. They have
[56:37] certain habits.
[56:38] [Applause]
[56:40] They have things they apply on a daily
[56:43] basis.
[56:46] Amen.
[56:47] Praise the Lord. They get up at a
[56:48] certain time.
[56:50] They don't sleep in like that.
[56:53] They get up with a cuz they got a
[56:55] purpose.
[56:56] They realize, I'm not going to achieve
[56:58] my goals laying here in this bed like
[57:01] this.
[57:03] So they get up early in the morning so
[57:06] they can take care of certain things so
[57:07] they can have more time to apply
[57:10] themselves
[57:12] to attaining their goals.
[57:14] How much more sense with God?
[57:18] How does the devil Amen look at how he
[57:21] desires to hinder us?
[57:23] He don't want us to get up early to
[57:25] pray.
[57:28] He don't want us to get up early and
[57:29] read the word of God to set the
[57:33] atmosphere on the inside of us.
[57:36] Because when we fail to do that, saints,
[57:38] we know we in for a rough time.
[57:42] whatever trials we experience while we
[57:44] are not praying up, while we're not in
[57:46] the word like we supposed to. Cuz when
[57:47] you do those things, saints, what
[57:49] happens? It brings that sweet anointing.
[57:51] Yes,
[57:53] that sweet presence of God. When you're
[57:55] in fellowship with God and you're
[57:57] spending time with God, you step out
[57:59] into the same world, but you're not able
[58:01] to be as affected.
[58:06] Amen. Man, when disappointments arise or
[58:08] anything doesn't go your way, it don't
[58:10] affect you like it would if you wasn't
[58:12] in that atmosphere.
[58:17] It brings about a sweetness.
[58:20] It brings about a calmness.
[58:24] On the I talked about Jeff Bezos, but on
[58:26] the spiritual side of it, anybody that
[58:28] you saw attain any spiritual height,
[58:32] it's because they sought it diligently.
[58:35] They sought the Lord diligently.
[58:40] We want more of God, don't we?
[58:43] How many want more of God?
[58:45] Amen. How many realize there's more of
[58:46] God to get?
[58:48] But the question is, how are you
[58:50] applying yourself?
[58:52] [Applause]
[58:56] Praying every once in a while whenever
[58:58] it's convenient. You got to make
[59:00] sacrifices.
[59:02] Jeff Bezos made sacrifices.
[59:06] Amen.
[59:08] Any successful businessman, that success
[59:10] don't come without sacrifice.
[59:13] Doing things when you don't feel like
[59:15] doing it.
[59:17] But you do it anyway because you realize
[59:19] that's what it's going to take for me to
[59:21] be able to get to my goal.
[59:24] Amen.
[59:26] We want to go higher in God. People
[59:28] praise the prophet,
[59:29] but how many realize the prophet said,
[59:31] "Don't even look at him."
[59:33] That's right.
[59:34] He said, "Because you also have to come
[59:36] to mature wheat."
[59:38] He can't just sit gazing at the prophet
[59:40] and admiring the prophet for how God
[59:42] worked in his life. He says, "No, sir.
[59:44] That same God is here right now."
[59:48] Amen. To bring every one of us into our
[59:50] rightful positions.
[59:54] We don't want to be the kind of people
[59:55] that just sit back always talking about,
[59:57] oh I want a prophet this and a prophet
[59:59] that.
[1:00:00] The God of that prophet is here now.
[1:00:03] That prophet came by the grace of God to
[1:00:06] help to unite God and his bride
[1:00:08] together.
[1:00:11] Is that right?
[1:00:14] But look at the life that brother lived
[1:00:15] though.
[1:00:17] Amen. That brother sacrificed. That
[1:00:21] brother laid before the Lord.
[1:00:23] He had a disciplined life
[1:00:25] and he diligently
[1:00:27] he diligently sought the Lord. Saints
[1:00:31] he spent time in prayer.
[1:00:35] How many realize that?
[1:00:37] That brother spent hours in prayer.
[1:00:41] Amen.
[1:00:43] His wife used to get upset with him.
[1:00:46] Amen. Because of the lifestyle that he
[1:00:49] lived. She didn't understand it.
[1:00:52] But he said concerning that, she don't
[1:00:54] understand that we're in a battle.
[1:00:58] And so whereas she got upset when he
[1:01:00] wanted to go out seemingly into the
[1:01:01] wilderness and seemingly hurt a little
[1:01:03] bit, he wasn't going really much for her
[1:01:05] at all.
[1:01:07] He was going out to get away from the
[1:01:08] people and get with God.
[1:01:12] He didn't have to do that.
[1:01:14] But in his heart, something was touched.
[1:01:17] And that same thing is in the blood
[1:01:18] also.
[1:01:20] We just got to give more place to it.
[1:01:23] There's a hunger on the inside of us
[1:01:25] right now.
[1:01:31] We've been held back.
[1:01:33] The prophet told us we're living
[1:01:34] thousands of miles below our privileges.
[1:01:38] How so?
[1:01:43] He said the rapture should happen.
[1:01:47] How so? Uh-huh.
[1:01:51] That's exactly right.
[1:01:53] Amen.
[1:01:55] My
[1:01:57] hallelujah.
[1:01:57] Listen, saints.
[1:01:59] Again, in Proverbs,
[1:02:02] our opening scripture says,
[1:02:04] "He becometh poor that dealth with a
[1:02:07] slack hand." Amen.
[1:02:11] So now for those that want to attain a
[1:02:13] better lifestyle,
[1:02:15] for those that that want to attain
[1:02:17] higher spiritual heights, things you
[1:02:19] things you notice there.
[1:02:21] Yes, sir.
[1:02:22] Oh, man.
[1:02:24] But you ain't you you haven't tapped
[1:02:26] into it yet.
[1:02:29] Yes, sir.
[1:02:30] What are you doing any different?
[1:02:35] That's a common saying we've heard many
[1:02:37] times over. Isn't that right? How can we
[1:02:39] do the same thing we've always done and
[1:02:41] expect different results?
[1:02:46] We say we want it, but that's what our
[1:02:48] miles, our actions show how much we
[1:02:51] really want it.
[1:02:54] And I I'm not going to take that away
[1:02:56] from anybody. I want more of God. But
[1:02:58] but but how am I applying myself?
[1:03:03] And we're not trying to work our way
[1:03:04] into anything.
[1:03:06] But notice God is saying here, he that
[1:03:09] dude with a slack hand become poor.
[1:03:12] He said with the hand of the diligence,
[1:03:14] you'll become rich.
[1:03:16] God said that.
[1:03:18] Why is he saying that saints? Because
[1:03:19] he's showing with diligence. When you go
[1:03:22] after anything with diligence, there is
[1:03:24] something you're going to achieve and
[1:03:25] obtain.
[1:03:30] Hallelujah.
[1:03:31] Praise the Lord.
[1:03:33] Lord,
[1:03:33] watch this. Hebrews 11 and verse 6. Very
[1:03:37] popular scripture. Everybody knows about
[1:03:39] it. It says, "But without faith,
[1:03:42] it's impossible to please him."
[1:03:45] Amen. It says, "For he that cometh to
[1:03:47] God must first believe that he is and
[1:03:50] watch and that he is a rewarder of who?
[1:03:58] I'm talking about the hand of the
[1:04:00] diligent here. Now,
[1:04:01] he that deal with Hey, the hand of the
[1:04:03] diligent shall be made rich.
[1:04:06] Amen.
[1:04:07] Yes, sir.
[1:04:07] The Bible says if God will reward you.
[1:04:10] Yes, sir.
[1:04:11] If you seek him
[1:04:14] diligently.
[1:04:16] Yes, sir.
[1:04:17] Hallelujah.
[1:04:17] Now, how much do we want more of God?
[1:04:20] Amen.
[1:04:22] What changes are we willing to make?
[1:04:25] What are we willing to lay downh
[1:04:28] and what are we willing to start doing?
[1:04:32] It has to mean more than you what it
[1:04:34] currently than what it currently does.
[1:04:36] Cuz when something really means
[1:04:37] something to you, Amen. Nobody ain't got
[1:04:39] to tell you to do it.
[1:04:41] That's right.
[1:04:42] Amen.
[1:04:42] You'll go hard.
[1:04:44] That's right.
[1:04:45] When it Listen, I tell my kids this.
[1:04:48] Hallelujah.
[1:04:50] Whatever you have an interest in,
[1:04:53] nobody ever has to tell you to look into
[1:04:56] it,
[1:04:57] listen to it, look at it, do it, or
[1:05:00] whatever.
[1:05:02] One of my sons, he loves video games.
[1:05:05] I ain't never got to go tell him, "Son,
[1:05:07] go play your video game."
[1:05:11] If anything, I got to say, "Son, give it
[1:05:13] a break."
[1:05:13] That's right.
[1:05:14] Why? He has an interest in it.
[1:05:17] Watch this. Let's touch on a few
[1:05:20] definitions for you.
[1:05:21] Yes, sir.
[1:05:22] All right.
[1:05:22] Yes. All right.
[1:05:23] Watch this. Now, when you talk about
[1:05:26] being slothful,
[1:05:29] the word slothful comes from sloth.
[1:05:33] Watch what the definition of sloth
[1:05:34] means, saints. It means a
[1:05:37] disincclination to action or labor.
[1:05:40] Watch what it says here now. It says
[1:05:43] spiritual apathy.
[1:05:46] Right.
[1:05:48] So what is apathy? Apathy is saints.
[1:05:51] Amen. Lack of interest,
[1:05:54] enthusiasm or concern.
[1:05:57] Yes, my brother.
[1:05:58] Yes, sir.
[1:06:00] Yes, my brother.
[1:06:03] Hallelujah.
[1:06:04] So, he that dealing with a slack hand,
[1:06:07] that's a lazy person.
[1:06:11] They want the results of diligence, but
[1:06:13] they're not willing to apply diligence.
[1:06:15] Amen.
[1:06:19] Lord,
[1:06:21] spiritual apathy, a lack of interest,
[1:06:28] no raising of hands,
[1:06:30] but how many times have we been in the
[1:06:32] word just this week or this day?
[1:06:35] How much time have we really given to
[1:06:37] it?
[1:06:38] Right.
[1:06:39] In prayer.
[1:06:42] How? Now, I'm not talking about just
[1:06:44] getting down and doing something.
[1:06:47] Well, I know I need to pray. Let me go
[1:06:48] ahead and Lord Jesus, have mercy on us.
[1:06:51] Have mercy. But your heart, you ain't
[1:06:52] there.
[1:06:55] How many realize God knows the
[1:06:57] difference?
[1:07:00] You just can't throw something to God
[1:07:02] and expect for him to be able just to
[1:07:04] take it like that.
[1:07:05] [Music]
[1:07:08] I'm I'm talking about diligence, dealing
[1:07:11] with a the right hand be having a right
[1:07:14] mind and a right heart more than just an
[1:07:16] action.
[1:07:18] Amen. That's right.
[1:07:20] Israel had an action.
[1:07:21] That's right.
[1:07:23] Amen.
[1:07:25] Listen,
[1:07:26] we're going to get into something here.
[1:07:30] Israel had action.
[1:07:31] Yes.
[1:07:32] They came to the synagogue.
[1:07:35] Jesus.
[1:07:37] faithfully.
[1:07:42] They offer sacrifices
[1:07:45] faithfully.
[1:07:46] Uhhuh.
[1:07:48] Wow.
[1:07:50] Hallelujah.
[1:07:52] Preach, my brother.
[1:07:53] Amen.
[1:07:54] And at one point,
[1:07:57] God accepted it.
[1:07:59] Uhhuh.
[1:08:00] But in those same actions that they
[1:08:02] continued to keep like clockwork,
[1:08:06] Yes, sir.
[1:08:10] God turned around and said, "I hate
[1:08:12] him."
[1:08:13] Uhhuh.
[1:08:14] I detest them.
[1:08:17] It's a stench in my nostrils.
[1:08:20] What made it a stench?
[1:08:22] Come on.
[1:08:23] Versus a sweet smelling savior
[1:08:26] is where their heart was.
[1:08:30] It's not enough to come to church.
[1:08:32] That's right.
[1:08:33] How many understand that?
[1:08:36] It's not enough to pay your tithes.
[1:08:39] Glory.
[1:08:41] Huh?
[1:08:42] It's not enough to read your Bible.
[1:08:45] It's not enough to pray.
[1:08:48] Because wherever your heart is,
[1:08:52] that's what determines how pleasing it
[1:08:55] is to God.
[1:08:57] He don't care about your actions like
[1:08:58] that. He don't care about your words
[1:09:01] like that. He told them, "You draw nine
[1:09:04] to me with your mouth."
[1:09:06] He said, "But your heart is far from
[1:09:07] me."
[1:09:10] All loving God, he's standing there
[1:09:12] watching his people come to him, but his
[1:09:14] people's hearts were in other places
[1:09:16] even though they were in his presence.
[1:09:23] [Music]
[1:09:25] I ain't fussing at you.
[1:09:29] This is just going a certain direction.
[1:09:32] I'm trying to follow the GPS.
[1:09:36] Amen.
[1:09:38] But how many realize God wants a whole
[1:09:40] heart service?
[1:09:43] Watch this. Hallelujah.
[1:09:49] The word diligent,
[1:09:50] yes, my brother,
[1:09:51] it means having or showing care
[1:09:54] Uhhuh.
[1:09:56] and conscientiousness
[1:09:59] in one's work or duties.
[1:10:03] Amen.
[1:10:04] Amen. You can ask somebody to clean
[1:10:06] something
[1:10:09] and depending on where their heart and
[1:10:11] their mind is, they're irritated or
[1:10:12] agitated, they'll go
[1:10:18] there, it's done.
[1:10:21] Satisfied now.
[1:10:24] And especially with a parent,
[1:10:26] a parent sees the attitude in which
[1:10:29] things are done.
[1:10:30] Yes, sir.
[1:10:31] By their children. Yeah.
[1:10:33] I watch facial expressions.
[1:10:36] I watch how they move.
[1:10:38] Cuz I can I can pick up attitude from
[1:10:40] those things.
[1:10:42] Cuz it ain't enough for you to do what I
[1:10:44] said.
[1:10:46] I want you to be able to understand why
[1:10:48] it is that you're doing it. But I want
[1:10:50] your I want you to be able to understand
[1:10:52] and do things out of the right heart and
[1:10:54] the right mind. Cuz even when you get in
[1:10:57] that real world
[1:10:59] and you start doing tasks for your
[1:11:01] manager or your boss in a certain way,
[1:11:03] you in a bad out of a job.
[1:11:06] You'll be bypassed for promotions.
[1:11:10] Because you're doing what they saying,
[1:11:11] but you're not doing it in the right
[1:11:13] way, the right attitude, the right
[1:11:15] heart.
[1:11:16] Listen, you're not doing it as unto the
[1:11:19] Lord.
[1:11:24] But you got to care enough about God.
[1:11:26] See,
[1:11:28] [Music]
[1:11:30] so when you talk about diligence, you're
[1:11:32] talking about doing something and having
[1:11:34] a care about it that determines how it's
[1:11:36] actually done.
[1:11:39] That's what makes it pleasing to God or
[1:11:41] not pleasing to God.
[1:11:44] Do you understand? Yes, sir.
[1:11:46] The Bible says God loves Watch this.
[1:11:49] Hallelujah.
[1:11:51] Praise the Lord.
[1:11:54] The Bible says that God loves saints
[1:11:58] a cheer forgiver.
[1:12:00] Amen.
[1:12:01] Isn't that right?
[1:12:04] But if you give grudgingly,
[1:12:07] Paul talked about this.
[1:12:09] Yes, sir.
[1:12:10] Paul said, "If you give grudgingly or by
[1:12:13] necessity,
[1:12:16] well, I got to pay my tithe. Let me go
[1:12:18] ahead and pay my tithe.
[1:12:22] I really don't want to do it, but by by
[1:12:24] necessity, let me go ahead and pay my
[1:12:26] here.
[1:12:28] Bitting up the envelope and everything,
[1:12:30] man.
[1:12:34] I I need that money,
[1:12:36] man.
[1:12:40] Maybe I might be able to skip it
[1:12:43] and it won't. I got other things I want
[1:12:44] to get. I'm tired of being broke all the
[1:12:46] time, man. I want some extra money for
[1:12:48] myself. So you pay tithe,
[1:12:51] but your mind and your heart ain't in
[1:12:52] the right place.
[1:12:56] And as far as God is concerned, saints,
[1:12:58] you can keep it.
[1:13:03] If you don't realize without him, you
[1:13:05] wouldn't even have that.
[1:13:07] You wouldn't have nothing that you have.
[1:13:10] You wouldn't be able to wake up. You
[1:13:11] would you wouldn't you would not have
[1:13:13] been able to be accepted for the job. He
[1:13:16] blessed you to get the job. He blessed
[1:13:17] you to have the money.
[1:13:20] And now he's out. Listen to me now.
[1:13:27] We allow the devil to convince us to
[1:13:29] keep a hundred.
[1:13:31] And then later on that week or that
[1:13:32] month, you got a problem that comes up
[1:13:34] that cost you 600.
[1:13:36] [Applause]
[1:13:37] Praise my brother.
[1:13:38] Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:13:42] I got this extra chain. I ain't paying
[1:13:44] my ties, but I got enough money to be
[1:13:46] able to go get me something to eat and
[1:13:48] all kind of stuff.
[1:13:50] And why you got your mind and your mouth
[1:13:52] all set for those things.
[1:13:54] Now your car breakdown is you going down
[1:13:56] the road.
[1:13:58] Now it cost you $450
[1:14:01] to get that car fixed.
[1:14:04] That's right.
[1:14:04] What brings those things about?
[1:14:09] Now, I'm not saying every time you got a
[1:14:10] trial or something that's because God
[1:14:12] punishing you or whatever. I'm saying in
[1:14:14] these certain cases where a person is
[1:14:16] struggling to obey God in his word, when
[1:14:19] their heart and their mind is not right.
[1:14:23] God sees that.
[1:14:26] But yet, we want to increase.
[1:14:28] We want God to bless. We want God to be
[1:14:30] there all the time for us whenever we
[1:14:32] call.
[1:14:35] And in the least things that he gives us
[1:14:37] to do.
[1:14:38] Yes.
[1:14:39] Look at how we handle him.
[1:14:40] That's right.
[1:14:44] Hallelujah.
[1:14:47] Can we say praise the Lord?
[1:14:52] So now God's desire is that we be like
[1:14:55] him. And being that he's diligent, he
[1:14:58] want us to be diligent in all of our
[1:15:00] look in every part of our lives.
[1:15:04] Amen.
[1:15:06] When we go to work, God want us to work
[1:15:08] diligently.
[1:15:09] Yes, Lord.
[1:15:11] When we're at home, God want us to do
[1:15:13] things diligently, take care of things,
[1:15:15] maintain things.
[1:15:19] Because if you're lazy and you rather
[1:15:21] lay down than get up and take care of
[1:15:24] things than then in one thing that could
[1:15:26] have been easily taken care of, it grows
[1:15:28] into a bigger problem that it didn't
[1:15:30] even have to grow into.
[1:15:33] Amen.
[1:15:35] Watch this, saints.
[1:15:38] Praise the Lord.
[1:15:40] It says in Proverbs in 24 and verse 30,
[1:15:44] it says, "I went by the field of the
[1:15:46] slothful
[1:15:47] and by the vineyard of the man void of
[1:15:49] understanding."
[1:15:50] Uhhuh.
[1:15:51] It says, "And lo, it was all grown over
[1:15:53] with thorns, and needles had covered the
[1:15:55] face thereof, and the stone wall thereof
[1:15:58] was broken down."
[1:16:00] Then I saw and considered it well. I
[1:16:02] looked upon it and received instruction.
[1:16:05] So here it is. Solomon is saying,
[1:16:07] "Amen." That I went by this field and
[1:16:10] God began to minister to me.
[1:16:13] Yes, sir.
[1:16:14] Yes, sir.
[1:16:15] Do you see that?
[1:16:18] God by this certain field. And he called
[1:16:22] Solomon to stop and take notice of the
[1:16:24] condition of the land and the property
[1:16:27] that he was passing.
[1:16:29] And when Solomon stopped and began to
[1:16:31] pay attention, he said he began to
[1:16:33] receive instruction. meaning God be to
[1:16:36] speak to his heart.
[1:16:37] Yes.
[1:16:38] Why would God take time to do that
[1:16:41] concerning a field grown over and a
[1:16:43] house broken down?
[1:16:45] Cuz it was something very important to
[1:16:47] him that he wanted to be able to
[1:16:48] communicate.
[1:16:49] Amen.
[1:16:50] Watch what he goes on to say.
[1:16:52] Hallelujah.
[1:16:54] He says in verse 32, "Then I saw and
[1:16:56] considered it well. I looked upon it and
[1:16:58] received instruction." He says, "Yet a
[1:17:00] little sleep."
[1:17:02] Notice this. Now, this is he he he's now
[1:17:05] explaining how the land came into that
[1:17:08] condition.
[1:17:08] Yes, my brother.
[1:17:09] Yes, sir.
[1:17:10] A little sleep.
[1:17:11] Yes, sir.
[1:17:12] A little slumber.
[1:17:13] Uh-huh.
[1:17:13] When you could have gotten up, when you
[1:17:15] knew you had that leak,
[1:17:17] Uh-huh.
[1:17:17] that piece of wood needed to be
[1:17:19] replaced.
[1:17:20] Yes,
[1:17:21] that leak in your car needed to be taken
[1:17:22] care of.
[1:17:24] That leak in your spiritual life,
[1:17:27] that leak in your prayer life,
[1:17:29] that leak in the time in which you you
[1:17:31] need to spend with God,
[1:17:34] get a little slumber, a little sleep.
[1:17:36] Amen.
[1:17:38] Praise God. A little folding of the
[1:17:41] hands.
[1:17:42] Just want to relax all the time.
[1:17:45] Just want to have it easy all the time.
[1:17:48] Just want to be made comfortable all the
[1:17:50] time. just want to be catered to all the
[1:17:53] time.
[1:17:54] Want everything to come easy.
[1:17:59] And as a result of that, we get lazy.
[1:18:02] Yes, sir.
[1:18:03] Yes, sir.
[1:18:04] Oh, I'm waiting on God to come and do
[1:18:06] whatever, whatever, whatever.
[1:18:09] When God sitting there waiting on us,
[1:18:13] brother Brandon said, "God already had
[1:18:15] Moses ready." Yeah. Amen.
[1:18:18] He said, "But it took the people that
[1:18:20] long to get into the right condition."
[1:18:23] Amen.
[1:18:25] Because why? They had it good down there
[1:18:27] in Egypt.
[1:18:29] Yes, sir.
[1:18:30] So God had to disturb things and disrupt
[1:18:33] things to do what saints
[1:18:35] to bring his people into their promise.
[1:18:39] It made them uncomfortable. Amen.
[1:18:42] But it's the way God has to deal with
[1:18:44] them. Yeah.
[1:18:46] And did not all prophet speak to us and
[1:18:48] said, "It's the tender hand of Jehovah
[1:18:50] that led Israel in this day
[1:18:53] back to the promised land how
[1:18:55] through persecutions."
[1:18:58] Amen. Through trials,
[1:19:00] through danger,
[1:19:02] why saints? Because while they were all
[1:19:04] over the world and other countries, they
[1:19:06] had become very comfortable and very
[1:19:08] relaxed.
[1:19:10] They they they had established
[1:19:11] businesses and and all these they had
[1:19:13] good lifestyles.
[1:19:15] [Applause]
[1:19:16] They were accepted by the people that
[1:19:18] were around them in whatever country
[1:19:20] they was in.
[1:19:22] So what did God have to do, saints? He
[1:19:24] had to turn it upside down.
[1:19:26] Amen.
[1:19:28] Can you imagine how Israel felt? They
[1:19:30] didn't understand. They were confused.
[1:19:32] And many times we don't understand why
[1:19:34] we go through the things we do.
[1:19:35] That's exactly right.
[1:19:37] We ask God many times, why?
[1:19:40] Why is the pressure like that? Why do I
[1:19:42] seem to go from one trial to another,
[1:19:44] Lord?
[1:19:44] Praise God.
[1:19:45] God knows exactly what he's doing. He
[1:19:47] knows exactly what you and I need.
[1:19:51] Praise God.
[1:19:53] A little slumber, a little sleep, a
[1:19:54] little folding of the hands to sleep. So
[1:19:57] shall thy poverty come as one that
[1:20:00] travaleth that traveleth and thy want as
[1:20:03] an armed man.
[1:20:06] That property wasn't like that all the
[1:20:07] time.
[1:20:08] That's right. That was a good standing
[1:20:10] property in good condition. The wall
[1:20:12] wasn't always broken down.
[1:20:15] But it was through neglect.
[1:20:17] Yes, sir.
[1:20:18] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:20:21] Somehow or another, the individual just
[1:20:24] got lazy because the instruction that
[1:20:26] God gave him when he looked at the land
[1:20:28] was a little sleep, a little slumber, a
[1:20:30] little folding of the hands. That's how
[1:20:32] this land came into that condition.
[1:20:35] Amen.
[1:20:36] Yes, my brother.
[1:20:38] Yes, sir.
[1:20:39] Within our own selves, sometimes we can
[1:20:41] look and see that things are all out of
[1:20:43] control. When you look at that land
[1:20:44] being all grown over, it was out of
[1:20:46] control.
[1:20:47] Amen.
[1:20:48] Things that shouldn't have been growing
[1:20:50] there was growing there.
[1:20:53] Yes.
[1:20:55] Yes.
[1:20:57] Hallelujah.
[1:20:59] It was permitted to grow.
[1:21:02] Exactly right.
[1:21:03] It wasn't being tended to. Amen.
[1:21:06] Amen.
[1:21:09] Spiritually, there was a slothfulness.
[1:21:14] A spiritual apathy.
[1:21:16] Amen.
[1:21:17] A lack of interest, a lack of concern, a
[1:21:19] lack of enthusiasm about achieving and
[1:21:22] going forward in the things of God.
[1:21:25] No desire to really progress. Just got
[1:21:28] content with just living the religious
[1:21:30] life.
[1:21:32] Come on, Holy Ghost.
[1:21:34] And you want to know one characteristic
[1:21:36] of a lazy person?
[1:21:39] It's one main characteristic of every
[1:21:41] person that's lazy.
[1:21:45] They blame their condition. They blame
[1:21:47] the way things on on somebody else or
[1:21:50] something else. They always make
[1:21:53] excuses.
[1:21:54] [Applause]
[1:21:58] Amen.
[1:22:00] Always making excuses.
[1:22:03] This is why this ain't that way. And
[1:22:05] this is why this ain't that way.
[1:22:08] I always look at the church as being
[1:22:09] full of hypocrites.
[1:22:12] Uhhuh.
[1:22:12] This is why God ain't moving in the
[1:22:14] church cuz there's a bunch of hypocrites
[1:22:16] in there. Things of that nature. You
[1:22:17] know what I got to say to that person?
[1:22:20] Well, if you know so much about it,
[1:22:23] then where is the power and the moving
[1:22:24] of God in your life?
[1:22:29] You got so much to say about everybody
[1:22:31] else.
[1:22:33] Why is it that in your own life?
[1:22:36] Be an example to somebody.
[1:22:38] Be an example of what you asking for and
[1:22:40] what you talking about.
[1:22:44] But they're slothful. They're lazy. They
[1:22:46] don't have no real intentions on trying
[1:22:47] to achieve those things.
[1:22:49] Right. Right.
[1:22:51] How many realize certain people just
[1:22:52] have that place?
[1:22:53] Uh-huh.
[1:22:55] It's not within them to become anymore.
[1:22:58] Hallelujah.
[1:22:59] It's within them to be a hindrance
[1:23:01] and a trouble and a problem
[1:23:04] for the true bride of Christ
[1:23:06] that really desires in her heart
[1:23:09] to be everything that her Lord is
[1:23:11] calling for.
[1:23:13] Amen. I know within a bride right now,
[1:23:15] even as I'm speaking right now, within
[1:23:17] the heart of every member of the bride
[1:23:18] in here this night,
[1:23:20] it's within you to be everything that
[1:23:22] God is calling for. You want to fulfill
[1:23:25] the desire of your husband.
[1:23:28] We don't want to be slack.
[1:23:30] But the enemy wants us to be slack
[1:23:32] because he knows it hinders our results.
[1:23:37] Hallelujah.
[1:23:39] Can we say amen, church?
[1:23:42] If he can slow us down, make us lazy
[1:23:44] spiritually,
[1:23:48] then you're less of a threat.
[1:23:54] And that's exactly what he wants because
[1:23:55] he knows that if we get in our place, if
[1:23:58] we humble ourselves,
[1:23:59] if we Amen. Amen. If we humble ourselves
[1:24:02] to God and allow God to gain more of a
[1:24:04] control and influence in our lives.
[1:24:06] Amen.
[1:24:07] Yes, sir.
[1:24:08] Then he'll be able to flow.
[1:24:11] Hallelujah.
[1:24:13] Hallelujah.
[1:24:14] Like I said, it ain't about just coming
[1:24:16] to church.
[1:24:18] How long we've been doing that?
[1:24:20] Yes, sir.
[1:24:23] And I'm not saying that coming to coming
[1:24:25] to church is a part of God's program.
[1:24:28] But he wants us to have the right focus.
[1:24:32] Amen.
[1:24:34] Look, this is only a part of it.
[1:24:36] What we do when we go home,
[1:24:42] we got to pray for one another, saints.
[1:24:46] We have our battles. We have our issues.
[1:24:48] Amen. But we need to pray for one
[1:24:50] another
[1:24:52] cuz it really is going home time.
[1:24:55] And don't get me wrong, we going to be
[1:24:56] exactly where we need to be when we need
[1:24:58] to be there.
[1:24:59] God is going to make sure of that.
[1:25:01] But just like brother Brandon said, God
[1:25:03] ain't going to Amen. You know, uh, a
[1:25:05] person sitting back be being pushed
[1:25:07] through a pipe. Every time he move
[1:25:08] through the pipe, is God pushing him?
[1:25:12] That's laziness.
[1:25:15] Every time you move, God moving you. He
[1:25:17] says,
[1:25:20] Hallelujah.
[1:25:21] Pick me up by the collar, Lord. Place me
[1:25:24] down where I need to be, Lord. No, sir.
[1:25:26] You got to fight.
[1:25:28] Yes, sir.
[1:25:29] For every inch of ground.
[1:25:35] You get into a ring with a good boxer
[1:25:36] and fights with a slack hand.
[1:25:42] You going to get beat up real good.
[1:25:45] Amen. Why? Amen.
[1:25:47] You're not on your toes.
[1:25:49] You're not being sharp. You're not being
[1:25:51] watchful.
[1:25:52] You're not staying focused.
[1:25:56] Hallelujah.
[1:25:57] Amen.
[1:25:59] Amen.
[1:25:59] Praise the Lord.
[1:26:01] Amen.
[1:26:02] Preacher.
[1:26:06] Let me touch upon something here for you
[1:26:07] real quickly, saints.
[1:26:09] Hallelujah.
[1:26:10] Our
[1:26:12] prophet said here in return in Jubilee,
[1:26:16] he says we need to go back to he says we
[1:26:18] need to go back to a power of God.
[1:26:21] Something that something that something
[1:26:23] that can do the same thing today.
[1:26:26] Although in our in our numbers, he says
[1:26:28] persecution always gives strength to the
[1:26:30] church. We've had it too easy. He says
[1:26:34] we get slothful. He says, he says we get
[1:26:36] to a place where we don't want to move
[1:26:39] on because everything's just handed to
[1:26:42] us. He says it takes sorrow. He said it
[1:26:45] takes tears and sweat and prayer and
[1:26:49] faith and promise to move forward in the
[1:26:52] power of the Holy Spirit.
[1:26:54] That zeal and power that they had in
[1:26:56] those days has long time vanished from
[1:27:00] our assemblies.
[1:27:01] Who was that?
[1:27:04] That was the Holy Ghost.
[1:27:07] That wasn't just a man expressing his
[1:27:09] own opinion.
[1:27:10] That was the Holy Ghost speaking to a
[1:27:12] church that God has spent time with
[1:27:16] who's supposed to be further up the road
[1:27:18] than what they were.
[1:27:21] That's one of the biggest hurdles right
[1:27:23] there.
[1:27:24] God got to help us to see where we are.
[1:27:26] Yes.
[1:27:29] Cuz many times we can account things to
[1:27:31] being more than what it actually is.
[1:27:34] And many times you you can account
[1:27:36] things to be less than where it actually
[1:27:37] is. But just be before God and allow him
[1:27:40] to show you where you really are.
[1:27:42] Amen.
[1:27:44] Hallelujah.
[1:27:45] This is God speaking to his church.
[1:27:48] Yes, sir.
[1:27:49] Listen. He says, praise God.
[1:27:51] Hallelujah.
[1:27:54] He says, "I believe that the reason we
[1:27:56] don't have desperation," he says, "is
[1:27:58] because it's a lack of love."
[1:28:00] He says, "The love of God." I think that
[1:28:03] the love of God causes desperation.
[1:28:06] If God is in you, the token inside of
[1:28:08] you and you see the conditions of the
[1:28:10] times and people waiting in sin the way
[1:28:13] they are, it'll throw you into
[1:28:14] desperation. I believe it will.
[1:28:17] But that love of God is shed abroad in
[1:28:19] our hearts by the Holy Ghost.
[1:28:22] When you have the Holy Ghost, there is
[1:28:24] something on the inside of you that
[1:28:26] begins to turn. Listen, it won't let you
[1:28:28] sit still.
[1:28:30] It won't let you be content.
[1:28:33] It won't let you be satisfied.
[1:28:36] Hallelujah.
[1:28:37] Hallelujah.
[1:28:38] He pushes you and pushes you beyond your
[1:28:41] known limits.
[1:28:43] He makes you uncomfortable.
[1:28:45] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:28:47] Amen.
[1:28:50] Hallelujah.
[1:28:52] Yes, sir.
[1:28:53] Brother said it's not supposed to be
[1:28:54] that way, but normally it takes a trial
[1:28:57] to get people into a desperation.
[1:29:00] Why do you think the squeeze has to
[1:29:02] come?
[1:29:03] That's right.
[1:29:04] How many realize is one of the main
[1:29:06] reasons why the squeeze has to come?
[1:29:12] It's just like the persecution had to
[1:29:14] come to Israel.
[1:29:15] Oh my god. If it wasn't for that, they
[1:29:17] wouldn't be in a promised land.
[1:29:19] That's right.
[1:29:22] What put them there?
[1:29:25] Think about it.
[1:29:26] Hallelujah.
[1:29:27] It's the persecution.
[1:29:28] Yes, sir.
[1:29:30] What's going to put us or push us into
[1:29:33] our positions as sons and daughters of
[1:29:35] God? What's going to make us more
[1:29:37] sincere about our daily prayer life?
[1:29:41] Yes, sir.
[1:29:42] Amen.
[1:29:44] You let a serious situation strike you
[1:29:46] serious enough, ain't nobody got to tell
[1:29:48] you like, ain't nobody got to tell you
[1:29:49] to pray.
[1:29:51] Listen, when serious situations strike
[1:29:53] our lives, we begin to pray without
[1:29:55] ceasing.
[1:29:58] You go to sleep praying. You wake up
[1:30:00] praying.
[1:30:02] You go to sleep and wake up on your
[1:30:03] knees.
[1:30:06] Cuz now there's a situation. But without
[1:30:08] that situation,
[1:30:10] a little slumber, a little sleep, a
[1:30:13] little folding of the hands.
[1:30:17] My brother.
[1:30:20] Can we say praise the Lord?
[1:30:22] Hallelujah.
[1:30:23] Many many.
[1:30:25] Many times in in children,
[1:30:28] we see things reflected.
[1:30:30] Hallelujah.
[1:30:32] That we many times bear on bear down on
[1:30:34] our children about.
[1:30:35] Uh-huh.
[1:30:37] Amen. We we we we we we give them
[1:30:39] discipline. We give them speeches and
[1:30:40] and things of that nature, right?
[1:30:44] But notice what the prophet says here.
[1:30:47] And hear ye him.
[1:30:49] He says, "We never have juvenile
[1:30:52] delinquency
[1:30:53] till we have parent delinquency."
[1:30:58] In Deuteronomy chapter 6 and verse 6, it
[1:31:01] says, "And these words which I command
[1:31:03] thee this day shall be in in thy heart."
[1:31:06] He says, "And thou shalt teach them
[1:31:08] diligently."
[1:31:09] Yes, my
[1:31:11] unto thy children.
[1:31:12] Yes, sir.
[1:31:14] Not every once in a while.
[1:31:16] That's right.
[1:31:17] Amen.
[1:31:20] Listen to me with an honest heart.
[1:31:21] Yes, sir.
[1:31:22] Hallelujah.
[1:31:23] Come on.
[1:31:25] If we notice behaviors in our children,
[1:31:29] things that are displeasing to us and we
[1:31:31] might bear down on them hard, we might
[1:31:33] be able to see, look, it's an evil
[1:31:35] spirit coming upon my child causing to
[1:31:37] be able to uh to do such and such or
[1:31:39] think such and such or to act in certain
[1:31:41] unacceptable ways.
[1:31:45] But then what God does, he turns the
[1:31:47] mirror.
[1:31:48] Amen.
[1:31:50] And he begins to cause you to look at
[1:31:52] yourself. Yes, sir.
[1:31:54] Yes, sir.
[1:31:54] What have you seown
[1:31:56] into that child's life?
[1:31:58] Uh-huh.
[1:31:59] Amen.
[1:32:02] Have you assumed the work was just going
[1:32:03] to be done like that?
[1:32:04] Uhhuh.
[1:32:06] In his word, he says, Amen. And thou
[1:32:09] shalt teach them diligently unto thy
[1:32:11] children, and shall talk of them when
[1:32:14] thou sitest in thine house, and when
[1:32:15] thou walst by the way, and when thou
[1:32:17] liest down, and when thou riseth up. And
[1:32:20] thou shalt bind them for a sign upon
[1:32:22] thine hand, and they shall be as
[1:32:24] fondness between thine eyes, and thou
[1:32:27] shalt write them upon the post of thine
[1:32:29] house and thy gates. And it shall be
[1:32:31] when the Lord thy God shall have brought
[1:32:33] thee into the land which he swear unto
[1:32:35] thy fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and
[1:32:37] Jacob, to give thee great and goodly
[1:32:40] cities, which thou buildest not, and
[1:32:42] houses full of good things, which thou
[1:32:45] filest not, and wells dig, which thou
[1:32:48] digest not. vineyards and and olive
[1:32:50] trees which thou plantest not. He says,
[1:32:53] "When thou shalt have eaten and be full,
[1:32:55] then beware, lest thou forget the Lord
[1:32:59] which brought thee forth out of the land
[1:33:01] of Egypt from the house of bondage."
[1:33:04] Why did he say teach them diligent
[1:33:06] diligently to our children?
[1:33:09] Amen.
[1:33:12] Because in the presence of that word
[1:33:14] Yes sir.
[1:33:15] keeping it upon their minds, keeping it
[1:33:17] before them. Yes sir.
[1:33:19] Yes sir.
[1:33:20] Amen. It brings them into the right
[1:33:21] atmosphere.
[1:33:24] Amen.
[1:33:25] Where the right influence remains upon
[1:33:28] them.
[1:33:28] Yes.
[1:33:30] How many realize that when we talk about
[1:33:32] God, when we read God's word, Amen. He's
[1:33:34] right there.
[1:33:36] Isn't that right?
[1:33:38] Amen. When we teach this word, this word
[1:33:41] children diligently, brother Brener said
[1:33:43] it right here. The reason why we see
[1:33:45] children delinquency is because we had
[1:33:47] parent delinquency. The parents wasn't
[1:33:50] spending enough quality time with the
[1:33:52] children teaching them the right things.
[1:33:56] And their misbehavior, their misconduct
[1:33:59] is a result of that.
[1:34:02] Yes, sir.
[1:34:02] You dealt with a slack hand.
[1:34:04] Uhhuh.
[1:34:05] Yeah.
[1:34:06] And that was the result of it.
[1:34:08] Yes, sir.
[1:34:10] Yes.
[1:34:10] Amen. Amen.
[1:34:13] Can we say praise the Lord?
[1:34:15] Praise the Lord.
[1:34:16] He also pointed out the pullpit
[1:34:18] delinquency.
[1:34:20] [Applause]
[1:34:21] Isn't that right?
[1:34:24] Where the word is being handled in a
[1:34:26] soft way.
[1:34:28] People more concerned with a meal
[1:34:29] ticket,
[1:34:31] gaining as many members as they can, but
[1:34:33] not caring enough about the people's
[1:34:35] souls.
[1:34:37] Amen. detour from speaking on certain
[1:34:40] things. Amen. Why? Cuz I might make
[1:34:43] somebody uneasy or upset.
[1:34:47] Amen.
[1:34:49] And as a result of that,
[1:34:51] that's what we got.
[1:34:52] You have churches that are full
[1:34:56] with all sorts of things.
[1:34:58] Amen.
[1:35:00] Amen.
[1:35:01] Amen.
[1:35:03] Hallelujah.
[1:35:05] Praise the Lord.
[1:35:05] Yes, sir.
[1:35:06] Amen. Amen.
[1:35:08] We never have juvenile delinquency till
[1:35:11] we have parent delinquency. You used to,
[1:35:13] he says, you used to love to go to
[1:35:15] prayer meetings and prayer till 12 and
[1:35:17] one and 1 and 2:00. He says he says lay
[1:35:20] on the lay on the little old cottage
[1:35:22] floor somewhere under the spirit of God.
[1:35:26] He says you used to love to pray all
[1:35:28] night, but since you got your
[1:35:30] television,
[1:35:33] so many people have let down saints.
[1:35:35] That's right.
[1:35:40] I hate to say this, but I'mma say it by
[1:35:42] the grace of God.
[1:35:45] For the people that left the message,
[1:35:48] you want to know one reason why they
[1:35:50] really left?
[1:35:53] Because they felt bound.
[1:35:55] Yeah.
[1:35:59] You watch the pattern.
[1:36:01] Anybody that leaves this message,
[1:36:03] Yeah. They go back into a sin that they
[1:36:07] go back and begin to do everything the
[1:36:09] prophet taught them not to do.
[1:36:13] The women start wearing pants.
[1:36:15] Yes, sir.
[1:36:15] Makeup.
[1:36:16] Yes, sir.
[1:36:17] They start having them movies, TV,
[1:36:20] whatever, all kind of shows, whatever.
[1:36:22] Now they they feel they've been set at
[1:36:24] liberty.
[1:36:25] Uhhuh.
[1:36:25] Not realizing you're bound.
[1:36:28] Hallelujah.
[1:36:29] That's a lifestyle of bondage. Yes, my
[1:36:32] brother.
[1:36:32] Demon powers being able to manifest
[1:36:35] themselves.
[1:36:36] Yes, sir.
[1:36:38] The very thing the prophet said he saw
[1:36:40] when he went to hell.
[1:36:43] Yes, sir.
[1:36:44] Them same demons.
[1:36:48] Yes, sir.
[1:36:49] Come back upon people.
[1:36:51] Uhhuh.
[1:36:52] And make them begin to reflect what hell
[1:36:54] is.
[1:36:58] I hadn't seen a failure of it yet,
[1:36:59] saints. When I see people leave, walk
[1:37:01] away from this message, they go right
[1:37:03] back into the things of the world.
[1:37:04] Yes, sir.
[1:37:05] And claim to be children of God.
[1:37:09] Mercy, Lord.
[1:37:11] Preach, my brother.
[1:37:12] My My God.
[1:37:14] Hallelujah.
[1:37:15] When the word teaches certain things,
[1:37:17] plain.
[1:37:19] Amen.
[1:37:20] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:37:24] But it's spiritual apathy.
[1:37:26] Yes, my brother. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. And
[1:37:29] it's a different seed.
[1:37:33] You hate to say those things. That's
[1:37:34] just the truth.
[1:37:37] Amen.
[1:37:38] Hallelujah.
[1:37:38] Prayer adventure. It might be somebody
[1:37:40] in here that the devil has been playing
[1:37:42] with.
[1:37:45] Trying to pull your mind back into the
[1:37:46] things of the world.
[1:37:50] A struggle might be going on.
[1:37:53] You see all the breaking away
[1:37:56] and the devil brings his reasonings.
[1:37:59] Amen.
[1:38:00] To try to make you feel like, well, is
[1:38:02] this really right?
[1:38:05] Amen.
[1:38:07] In your heart and in your mind, you have
[1:38:09] a desire to go back to those things.
[1:38:11] That's exactly right.
[1:38:15] I pray I pray God by his grace help you
[1:38:17] to snap out of that. Amen.
[1:38:19] Amen.
[1:38:19] Yes, Lord.
[1:38:20] Yes, Lord.
[1:38:21] If that's the case, I pray God help you
[1:38:22] to snap out of that.
[1:38:27] Amongst our young people,
[1:38:29] Hallelujah.
[1:38:30] You're in between right now.
[1:38:31] Yes, my brother.
[1:38:32] You don't have the Holy Ghost yet.
[1:38:36] And because of that, you don't
[1:38:37] understand a lot of things.
[1:38:39] So, you're watching all these splits
[1:38:41] take place.
[1:38:42] And the devil comes to you and begins to
[1:38:44] talk to you.
[1:38:46] Cuz he realizes your spiritual
[1:38:48] condition. Brother Brandham say he
[1:38:50] studies us.
[1:38:54] Amen.
[1:38:56] He studies how we handle the word.
[1:38:58] He watches how we pray.
[1:39:01] How much you really care
[1:39:03] about these things.
[1:39:06] My Lord Jesus.
[1:39:07] Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:39:11] If that's the case, then please, I pray
[1:39:13] God bless you to be able to see it's a
[1:39:15] trap.
[1:39:19] For anybody that made that decision,
[1:39:22] we don't want this to be the case,
[1:39:23] saints, but they're going to regret it.
[1:39:26] If the Lord don't have mercy and help
[1:39:27] them to turn back around,
[1:39:29] they're going to regret it.
[1:39:32] You'll never be able to make them see
[1:39:33] it.
[1:39:35] You understand?
[1:39:37] Cuz when God allows a spirit of slumber,
[1:39:39] Yeah.
[1:39:41] Amen.
[1:39:42] Amen.
[1:39:42] It brings about a blindness.
[1:39:45] It was a spirit of slumber that God let
[1:39:47] come on all of Israel
[1:39:49] with majority of them which cause them
[1:39:51] to reject them. Listen
[1:39:55] you don't realize that's the same thing
[1:39:57] today.
[1:39:59] Here you got God in flesh. You couldn't
[1:40:02] get no more God than that. God in flesh
[1:40:06] manifesting every single word that was
[1:40:08] spoken of him
[1:40:11] and yet people were able to look at him
[1:40:15] and say it's a devil.
[1:40:19] Why you think they coming against this
[1:40:20] message like this?
[1:40:23] It's a spirit blinding them.
[1:40:26] Yes, sir.
[1:40:28] Yes, sir.
[1:40:30] Amen.
[1:40:30] And for those of us that are true bride
[1:40:34] that we got to sit here and bear with
[1:40:36] the persecution,
[1:40:39] being called out of our names,
[1:40:42] being falsely accused, being
[1:40:43] misunderstood,
[1:40:46] right?
[1:40:48] He said, "Whatever they did, whatever
[1:40:50] you see them doing to me," he said,
[1:40:52] they're going to do the same thing to
[1:40:53] you.
[1:40:55] But what's going to be your reaction?
[1:40:58] Hallelujah.
[1:41:00] Hallelujah.
[1:41:01] Amen.
[1:41:04] By the grace of God, I ain't going
[1:41:06] nowhere.
[1:41:07] I don't care who come, who go.
[1:41:10] Uhhuh.
[1:41:10] I don't care how many fall away. I don't
[1:41:12] care who they are.
[1:41:15] It's been revealed.
[1:41:17] It's something that's truly anchored.
[1:41:19] Amen.
[1:41:20] This ain't just words.
[1:41:24] You'll see.
[1:41:25] Amen.
[1:41:26] The wheat remains.
[1:41:28] Amen.
[1:41:29] Amen.
[1:41:29] Amen.
[1:41:30] Amen. Amen.
[1:41:31] Lord have mercy.
[1:41:32] Hallelujah.
[1:41:33] Hallelujah.
[1:41:34] Hallelujah.
[1:41:35] Amen.
[1:41:36] Amen.
[1:41:37] Praise the Lord.
[1:41:38] Hallelujah.
[1:41:41] Brother Brandham says, "Usually it takes
[1:41:43] a state of emergency."
[1:41:44] Yes, sir.
[1:41:45] To throw us into desperation. See, it's
[1:41:47] too bad it's that way. He says, "But
[1:41:49] human beings are so slothful in their
[1:41:51] minds."
[1:41:54] Amen.
[1:41:56] The Bible says, "The hand of the
[1:41:57] diligent maketh rich." Yes.
[1:42:00] Why? They're consistent. They're
[1:42:02] persistent. They're steady
[1:42:05] in their pursuit
[1:42:07] of what they have an interest in.
[1:42:09] And whenever God is dealing with your
[1:42:11] heart, he puts an interest for himself
[1:42:13] on the inside of you.
[1:42:16] Amen.
[1:42:17] He gives you a thirst and a hunger
[1:42:20] for more of him.
[1:42:23] Amen.
[1:42:26] Praise God.
[1:42:28] He won't let you settle. He won't let
[1:42:29] you stay down.
[1:42:32] Amen.
[1:42:35] He told Israel
[1:42:37] in the book of Jeremiah.
[1:42:39] Yes, sir.
[1:42:41] He says in Jeremiah 29, "For thus sayeth
[1:42:44] the Lord, that after 70 years, the
[1:42:46] accomplished of Babylon, I will visit
[1:42:48] you and perform a good word toward you
[1:42:50] in causing you to return to this place.
[1:42:53] For I know the thoughts that I think
[1:42:54] toward you, sayeth the Lord, thoughts of
[1:42:56] peace and not of evil, to give you an
[1:42:58] expected end. When Israel was in that
[1:43:00] bondage, saints, they were confused.
[1:43:02] They didn't understand.
[1:43:04] It was hard. It didn't feel good.
[1:43:07] When God let you go through a trial
[1:43:08] sometimes,
[1:43:10] it's hard. It don't feel good.
[1:43:11] That's right.
[1:43:12] When you hit your rough spots in life,
[1:43:15] but how many realize every bit of that
[1:43:16] is exactly what you need? Amen.
[1:43:20] There's not a trial that can come to you
[1:43:22] that God doesn't permit to come to you
[1:43:24] because it was designed for you.
[1:43:27] You may not be able to see it, but he
[1:43:29] knows every bit of why he allowed that
[1:43:31] to come to you and what is going to
[1:43:33] benefit you.
[1:43:34] My brother,
[1:43:36] didn't understand.
[1:43:38] And God is sitting here by Jeremiah and
[1:43:41] say, "Only if you knew the thoughts I
[1:43:43] thought toward you."
[1:43:44] Thoughts of peace and not of evil. Even
[1:43:46] though you're c you're taken captive,
[1:43:48] you're in a foreign land under a king.
[1:43:51] That's a that's a gentile.
[1:43:54] I let you be uprooted from your house,
[1:43:56] from your comfortable living. Why?
[1:44:00] Cuz you wouldn't serve me.
[1:44:03] According to how I wanted you to,
[1:44:06] you gave you you gave me your strength.
[1:44:10] You gave me your actions in your body.
[1:44:13] But you begin to worship other gods.
[1:44:15] Right.
[1:44:16] You begin to worship the God of
[1:44:18] television.
[1:44:20] Right.
[1:44:21] All the different activities of the
[1:44:22] world.
[1:44:23] Right.
[1:44:24] We spend more time on social media.
[1:44:26] Yes.
[1:44:28] Hours upon hours upon hours. Any any in
[1:44:31] any any space of time we get people
[1:44:33] scrolling through social media seeing
[1:44:35] what the next interesting post is.
[1:44:38] my
[1:44:39] but then when it comes time to prayh
[1:44:41] when it comes time to read our word that
[1:44:43] the prophet told us if we do those
[1:44:45] simple things what happen saints will
[1:44:47] get closer to God
[1:44:49] how much do you want it
[1:44:52] the hand of the diligent maketh rich
[1:44:54] those that apply themselves to that you
[1:44:56] see them attaining spiritual riches
[1:45:01] [Applause]
[1:45:05] listen what God says here Now, this is
[1:45:07] why Israel, I had you go into captivity.
[1:45:10] Yes.
[1:45:10] Your heart went from me. You weren't
[1:45:12] worshiping me no more with all of your
[1:45:14] heart, all of your mind. You begin to
[1:45:17] give your attention and time to the
[1:45:19] devil,
[1:45:20] my
[1:45:20] adversary,
[1:45:22] the one that hates me.
[1:45:24] And because he hates me, he came after
[1:45:26] you. Cuz when he has you, he knows how
[1:45:28] it makes me feel.
[1:45:31] So to teach you a lesson, I let this
[1:45:33] trial come upon you. I let the snail
[1:45:36] come upon you.
[1:45:37] Wow.
[1:45:37] I allowed it to take you.
[1:45:39] Y
[1:45:41] cuz by my wisdom, I knew what was best
[1:45:43] for you to snap you out of that place.
[1:45:46] Out of that amnesia.
[1:45:48] Amen. Amen.
[1:45:50] Amen.
[1:45:51] Watch this. For I know the thoughts I
[1:45:53] think towards you, sayeth the Lord,
[1:45:54] thoughts of peace and not of evil, to
[1:45:56] give you an expected end. That was the
[1:45:59] whole purpose for it, to bring you into
[1:46:01] another end outside of where you were
[1:46:03] going. Amen.
[1:46:06] Amen.
[1:46:07] He says, "Then shall ye call upon me,
[1:46:10] and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I
[1:46:12] will hearken unto you,
[1:46:14] and ye shall seek me and find me. Watch
[1:46:17] when ye shall search for me with all
[1:46:21] of your heart."
[1:46:24] Amen.
[1:46:25] Hallelujah.
[1:46:26] How many realize that's important to
[1:46:27] God? I summon your heart,
[1:46:32] all of it.
[1:46:33] Amen.
[1:46:34] Amen.
[1:46:35] Amen.
[1:46:36] And I will be found of you, sayaeth the
[1:46:38] Lord, and I will turn away your
[1:46:39] captivity, and will gather you from all
[1:46:41] the nations, and from all the places
[1:46:43] where I have driven you, sayeth the
[1:46:45] Lord, and I will bring you again into
[1:46:47] this place once I called you to be
[1:46:48] carried away captive.
[1:46:50] Yes, my brother.
[1:46:51] I'm going restore you.
[1:46:52] Yes, my brother. That's it. Amen. I had
[1:46:55] to do this for a certain season.
[1:46:57] Yes, sir.
[1:46:58] Just to be able to get out of you what I
[1:47:00] desired to have out of you the whole
[1:47:02] time. What I knew was in you.
[1:47:06] But devils blinded you.
[1:47:08] Had your mind everywhere.
[1:47:12] Because of the attention that you gave
[1:47:14] for a moment. Brother Brandon said
[1:47:15] that's all it takes.
[1:47:18] You sit now listen remember I think I
[1:47:19] was Nelly Sanders.
[1:47:21] Yep.
[1:47:22] used to have a problem with loving music
[1:47:25] and dancing.
[1:47:26] Uhhuh.
[1:47:26] Uhhuh.
[1:47:27] The Lord delivered her.
[1:47:29] Yes, sir.
[1:47:30] That spirit left her. What did it look
[1:47:32] like? A big bat.
[1:47:38] Young children, why do you think the
[1:47:39] enemy tries to make you look at things
[1:47:41] you ain't supposed to look at?
[1:47:44] Because there's transferring of spirits.
[1:47:46] Yes, my brother.
[1:47:47] Beyond what you understand and what you
[1:47:48] can see.
[1:47:49] Yes, sir.
[1:47:50] Listen to this. Yes, sir.
[1:47:52] That young lady was delivered.
[1:47:54] Uhhuh.
[1:47:54] That spirit had left her,
[1:47:56] right?
[1:47:57] But she was coming up that road
[1:47:59] and the enemy had the DJ to play a
[1:48:02] certain song.
[1:48:02] That's exactly right.
[1:48:05] A song that he knew she would like
[1:48:07] because he knew she was coming,
[1:48:08] right?
[1:48:09] How many realize that Satan sets traps
[1:48:11] for you like that?
[1:48:13] Amen.
[1:48:14] Yes, sir.
[1:48:15] Yes, sir.
[1:48:16] He knew she was coming. So, he had the
[1:48:17] DJ play a certain song.
[1:48:19] That's right. Exactly. and she was
[1:48:20] walking out in the street.
[1:48:22] Yeah.
[1:48:25] And then all of a sudden, she began to
[1:48:28] pay too much attention
[1:48:30] right
[1:48:30] to that song.
[1:48:31] Yeah.
[1:48:32] Right.
[1:48:32] And brother Brandham said where she made
[1:48:34] her mistake, she stopped for a moment.
[1:48:39] How long did it take?
[1:48:44] Listen.
[1:48:45] Amen.
[1:48:46] As soon as she stopped
[1:48:48] and began to consider what was being
[1:48:50] played,
[1:48:52] that big bat that Brother Brandham saw
[1:48:54] come out of her.
[1:48:56] It came right in her at that time.
[1:48:59] Amen.
[1:49:00] And when it came on the inside of her,
[1:49:02] she didn't feel a jolt.
[1:49:03] She didn't feel like something else had
[1:49:05] ended on the inside of her. But that
[1:49:08] spirit came right in
[1:49:10] through what she was listening to.
[1:49:13] Yes. What are we listening to today?
[1:49:16] My brother,
[1:49:18] everybody's not able to be in the, you
[1:49:20] know, nobody's able to watch you all the
[1:49:23] time.
[1:49:23] That's right.
[1:49:24] Uh-huh.
[1:49:25] Exactly.
[1:49:26] You can turn to any station you want to.
[1:49:28] That's right.
[1:49:30] But the enemy knows what he's doing
[1:49:31] because once you turn to that wrong
[1:49:33] station and you give ear to one song.
[1:49:35] Yes, my brother. Listen, when she went
[1:49:37] to brother Brandham's house because she
[1:49:39] felt lost cuz after she after she
[1:49:41] stopped for a moment, she found herself
[1:49:43] on the dance floor. Then the Lord
[1:49:45] blessed her to come to herself
[1:49:47] and she realized I messed up. She went
[1:49:50] to brother Brandham's house. Went in
[1:49:51] there, he prayed for her. Door opened
[1:49:53] and closed by itself. Drunk man in the
[1:49:55] house. Bat came out of her. That demon
[1:49:58] went over by the drunk man. He became
[1:50:00] sober. Came out the bed running the
[1:50:02] other direction. Amen. Amen.
[1:50:05] What caused that?
[1:50:08] Lord Jesus.
[1:50:09] Amen.
[1:50:09] And here it is. The devil got us almost.
[1:50:12] I ain't going to say us cuz I I don't
[1:50:14] know. I don't know your lives in here.
[1:50:16] I know demons fight all of us.
[1:50:18] Praise my brother.
[1:50:19] And it's by the grace of God that we're
[1:50:21] kept.
[1:50:22] Praise the Lord.
[1:50:23] Amen.
[1:50:24] But through what you see and what you
[1:50:26] hear, these kind of things happen.
[1:50:28] Yes, sir.
[1:50:31] And then we got to be delivered.
[1:50:34] But if we would follow on to know the
[1:50:36] Lord
[1:50:37] and we would apply ourselves, man, you
[1:50:39] got to fight to do it.
[1:50:41] Amen.
[1:50:41] You're not going to want to pray all the
[1:50:43] time. But guess what? You know it's the
[1:50:45] best thing for you.
[1:50:47] When you're trying to get in shape, you
[1:50:49] don't want to eat broccoli and asparagus
[1:50:51] and fish and baked chicken all the time.
[1:50:53] You want to get a big nice greasy
[1:50:55] burger. Amen.
[1:50:57] You want to get some greasy pizza, some
[1:50:59] French fries,
[1:51:00] cuz it tastes good.
[1:51:03] You can continue to do that, but it's
[1:51:04] going to set you back.
[1:51:08] Amen.
[1:51:08] And whatever we're allowing spiritually.
[1:51:11] Yes, my brother.
[1:51:12] That's contrary to God.
[1:51:14] Yes, my brother.
[1:51:15] Whatever we're watching, whatever we're
[1:51:17] listening to, what whatever the case
[1:51:19] might be, I don't know.
[1:51:20] Amen.
[1:51:21] Amen.
[1:51:22] Amen. But it causes spiritual setbacks.
[1:51:32] Amen.
[1:51:33] Praise the Lord.
[1:51:34] Amen.
[1:51:35] I'm getting ready to close, saints.
[1:51:37] Ecclesiastes chapter 10 and verse 18, it
[1:51:40] says, "By much slothfulness,
[1:51:42] Yes, sir.
[1:51:43] the building decayth."
[1:51:44] Amen.
[1:51:46] Amen.
[1:51:47] A person at one time might have seen
[1:51:50] felt strong in the Lord.
[1:51:52] man, my prayer life is right.
[1:51:55] I'm reading the word. I'm doing what I
[1:51:57] supposed to do.
[1:51:59] And Satan's studying you and he's
[1:52:01] devising plans and strategies,
[1:52:04] bringing people your way. I don't know
[1:52:05] about you, saint. So, my It's kind of
[1:52:07] strange how when I got my mind set to go
[1:52:09] and pray and I'm getting everything set
[1:52:11] up to spend some time with God, my phone
[1:52:13] start ringing.
[1:52:15] Uhhuh. Uhhuh. It it didn't happen too
[1:52:18] many times for it to be just mere
[1:52:20] coincidence.
[1:52:21] [Applause]
[1:52:22] things come up.
[1:52:24] Yes, sir.
[1:52:25] That's exactly right.
[1:52:30] What is it? It's demon powers. Amen.
[1:52:33] Trying their best to block us.
[1:52:35] Amen.
[1:52:37] Amen.
[1:52:40] From being able to be diligent
[1:52:42] in the seeking of the Lord.
[1:52:44] Yes, sir.
[1:52:45] Brother Brandham tried to pray one time.
[1:52:48] He said the net start bothering. That's
[1:52:51] exactly right.
[1:52:53] So he tried to adjust himself, go to
[1:52:54] another side, and all of a sudden his
[1:52:57] mind began to think real carefully about
[1:52:59] how his knees felt with the rocks
[1:53:01] bearing to his knees.
[1:53:04] He said, "What was it? What was that?"
[1:53:05] He said, "It was the devil
[1:53:08] trying to keep him
[1:53:09] from receiving the message of the Lord."
[1:53:16] Amen. You see that gnats?
[1:53:20] The enemy actually getting innats
[1:53:23] and causing gnats to come around the
[1:53:24] prophet's head.
[1:53:26] Amen.
[1:53:27] Wow.
[1:53:28] Causing him to become conscious about
[1:53:30] how long he's been on his knees and the
[1:53:31] rocks, how they feel going against his
[1:53:33] knees.
[1:53:35] He had to get to a point to where he
[1:53:36] say, you know what, I don't care about
[1:53:38] none of it.
[1:53:39] I need God.
[1:53:42] Amen.
[1:53:44] And he stayed there. Yes sir.
[1:53:46] And he was diligent
[1:53:48] in his prayer and his seeking of the
[1:53:50] Lord.
[1:53:52] Hallelujah.
[1:53:53] And he was able to receive the blessing.
[1:53:56] Amen. Amen.
[1:53:58] His diligence brought forth a wealth of
[1:54:00] understanding.
[1:54:01] Yes. My s
[1:54:03] and of power.
[1:54:04] Yes, sir.
[1:54:05] In the Holy Ghost and the things of God.
[1:54:07] Amen.
[1:54:08] Amen.
[1:54:09] Thank you, Lord.
[1:54:12] Praise the Lord, saints.
[1:54:15] I'm going to read to you these few
[1:54:16] scriptures here and I'm going to leave
[1:54:17] this with you. Maybe you can go home and
[1:54:19] just read over them, meditate upon them,
[1:54:21] however the Lord will lead you.
[1:54:24] Proverbs 18 and verse 9, it says, "He
[1:54:26] also that is slothful is is work in his
[1:54:30] work is brother to him that is a
[1:54:32] waster."
[1:54:33] Praise the Lord.
[1:54:34] Amen.
[1:54:35] It says slothfulness casteth into a deep
[1:54:38] sleep
[1:54:39] and an idol soul shall suffer hunger.
[1:54:42] Amen. Amen.
[1:54:44] It says, "A slothful man hideth his hand
[1:54:46] in his bosom and will not so much as
[1:54:49] bring it to his mouth again."
[1:54:52] It says, "The desire of a slothful
[1:54:54] killth him, for his hands refuse to
[1:54:57] labor,
[1:54:59] always desiring something, but never
[1:55:01] really wanting to put forth the work to
[1:55:03] achieve it."
[1:55:07] The slothful man say, "If there is a
[1:55:09] lion in the way,"
[1:55:10] Uhhuh.
[1:55:11] a lion is in the streets. What does that
[1:55:13] mean? He's making an excuse.
[1:55:16] Amen. This is why I can't go outside.
[1:55:19] This is why I can't go and do the work
[1:55:20] that I need to do because there is a
[1:55:22] lion in the street.
[1:55:24] Amen. Spiritually speaking, the enemy
[1:55:27] tries to bring about excuses.
[1:55:30] Listen to this, saints. The word excuse,
[1:55:33] what does it mean? It means a reason or
[1:55:35] an explanation given to defend or
[1:55:37] justify a fault or an offense. To try
[1:55:40] and remove blame from
[1:55:43] Amen.
[1:55:44] Amen.
[1:55:45] That slothful man, he makes every
[1:55:47] reason. He gives every excuse to not do
[1:55:50] what he's supposed to do.
[1:55:52] That's right.
[1:55:53] And as a result of that, he becomes
[1:55:55] poor.
[1:55:57] As a result of that, everything that's
[1:55:59] around him begins to break down.
[1:56:02] Praise the Lord.
[1:56:03] Amen.
[1:56:04] Amen. Amen.
[1:56:06] Ecclesiastes 10 says again in verse 18,
[1:56:08] "By much loftiness the building decayth,
[1:56:11] and through utterness of of the hands
[1:56:13] the house dropth through."
[1:56:15] Amen.
[1:56:16] You let somebody have a little leak in
[1:56:18] their bathroom,
[1:56:21] they let it go for a while.
[1:56:23] There are many homes that people come
[1:56:25] across that end up being in this way.
[1:56:27] You let a little leak go, let it settle
[1:56:30] down into the floor, gets into the subf
[1:56:33] flooring or whatever you call it, and
[1:56:35] next thing you know, the the wood gets
[1:56:36] weak.
[1:56:38] And now all of a sudden, the toilet
[1:56:40] begins to drop,
[1:56:41] right?
[1:56:42] Because the foundation at its own, it
[1:56:44] can't hold the weight of it no more when
[1:56:46] somebody is sitting on it.
[1:56:48] But that was completely avoidable.
[1:56:51] He says through softness,
[1:56:53] Amen.
[1:56:54] the building decayth.
[1:56:56] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:56:58] Somebody's life just doesn't become all
[1:57:00] of a sudden out of control.
[1:57:02] Yes, sir.
[1:57:03] It was a process.
[1:57:05] Amen.
[1:57:06] Spiritually speaking, it was a process.
[1:57:08] It was things the enemy put there and
[1:57:10] put in their way and and ways in which
[1:57:12] he he he did certain things to bring
[1:57:15] about distractions. Amen. To keep the
[1:57:17] person away, their mind away from
[1:57:19] staying focused. Amen. And steady and
[1:57:22] steadfast.
[1:57:23] Amen.
[1:57:24] On the things of God. Yes, my brother.
[1:57:27] Yes, sir.
[1:57:28] Then many times we step back and we can
[1:57:30] see those that have progressed.
[1:57:32] Right.
[1:57:32] And then the enemy comes to you and
[1:57:34] begins to play with your mind again.
[1:57:36] Right.
[1:57:37] Had I only kept with it, I remember we
[1:57:40] started off together.
[1:57:42] Now look at how God is using them. Look
[1:57:44] at what God is doing through them. You
[1:57:46] might have a partner that you started
[1:57:48] with an exercise
[1:57:50] and whereas
[1:57:53] someone had a partner I don't want to
[1:57:55] use you but someone had a partner that
[1:57:57] they started with an exercise and a
[1:57:58] partner stayed consistent
[1:58:00] and they find themselves laying off and
[1:58:03] not really wanting to go but that
[1:58:04] partner had it within and it was a
[1:58:06] burning desire. I got to change my
[1:58:07] condition. I got to change how I am. I
[1:58:10] can't go on like this.
[1:58:12] And 3 months down the road, they look at
[1:58:14] their partner and man, you've lost so
[1:58:16] much weight. Man, you look so good.
[1:58:20] What made the difference?
[1:58:21] Amen.
[1:58:22] Hallelujah.
[1:58:23] They remain diligent.
[1:58:24] Yes, my brother.
[1:58:25] They didn't slack off.
[1:58:28] They held steady. They remained focused.
[1:58:33] Amen.
[1:58:33] The Lord wants us saints to be diligent.
[1:58:36] Amen.
[1:58:37] Yes, Lord.
[1:58:38] I need to be more diligent.
[1:58:40] Amen. I realize that.
[1:58:44] So, as I'm ministering tonight, saints,
[1:58:47] understand that I'm ministering to
[1:58:49] myself.
[1:58:49] Amen.
[1:58:50] I see areas of my life
[1:58:52] like, "Lord, I know that's not pleasing
[1:58:55] to you.
[1:58:56] Have mercy upon me."
[1:58:58] Lord,
[1:58:59] when brother Brandham talks about prayer
[1:59:01] life,
[1:59:01] Yes, sir.
[1:59:02] and the kind of experiences he had in
[1:59:04] prayer.
[1:59:05] Yes.
[1:59:06] where you just completely you become
[1:59:09] unconscious of this world
[1:59:12] and you enter into a real place.
[1:59:14] Amen.
[1:59:16] I think the Bible calls it praying
[1:59:18] according to your most holy faith in the
[1:59:20] Holy Ghost.
[1:59:22] Just get into a place where you become
[1:59:24] lost.
[1:59:25] Yes.
[1:59:26] These are real places.
[1:59:28] Yes, sir.
[1:59:29] Where God becomes more real to us than
[1:59:31] what we've ever known.
[1:59:32] Yes, Lord.
[1:59:35] But it's an individual affair.
[1:59:39] Amen.
[1:59:40] Amen.
[1:59:41] It doesn't matter how many people come
[1:59:42] with you. We ain't dealing with groups.
[1:59:45] It's on an individual basis.
[1:59:47] Young people, you ain't got to be old to
[1:59:50] really begin to seek God.
[1:59:53] Amen.
[1:59:54] You can apply yourself. you can see the
[1:59:56] val God can bless you to be able to see
[1:59:58] the value, you know, of the Christian
[1:59:59] life and really and and the benefit of
[2:00:02] it and and how blessed it is to have a
[2:00:04] close walk with him. And I last night I
[2:00:06] was talking to my son. He's 15 years old
[2:00:09] and he he he desires to have a little
[2:00:11] more money and things of that nature. I
[2:00:12] said, "Son, you're sitting around here
[2:00:14] and you you're worrying about how you're
[2:00:16] going to get more money and trying to
[2:00:17] figure out ways." I said, "But do you
[2:00:19] realize we serve a living God that's
[2:00:20] able to bless you in that way?"
[2:00:22] Amen. Amen.
[2:00:23] I said, "Have you prayed about it, son?"
[2:00:26] And I brought to his remembrance a
[2:00:28] testimony from my oldest boy.
[2:00:31] He's 23 now, but little Dennis, he had a
[2:00:34] desire for a pair of certain pair of
[2:00:36] Nikes called Air Force Ones.
[2:00:39] And at the time that he wanted him, I I
[2:00:42] didn't have enough money to be able to
[2:00:43] get it for him right then.
[2:00:46] And so when it's a little hard, he
[2:00:47] really wanted them or what have you. And
[2:00:49] it meant a lot to him. I said, "Well,
[2:00:50] son, listen." I said, "I don't have the
[2:00:52] money to to be able to buy these for you
[2:00:55] right now." I said, "But son, we serve a
[2:00:57] living God."
[2:00:58] Amen.
[2:01:00] And he cares about things.
[2:01:04] Amen.
[2:01:05] God didn't care so much about the shoes.
[2:01:08] But what he cared about was giving my
[2:01:10] son an experience.
[2:01:12] Amen.
[2:01:12] To show himself real to my son and give
[2:01:15] something to my son at an anchor in his
[2:01:16] soul.
[2:01:17] And the devil just can't take away.
[2:01:19] Amen. Praise brother.
[2:01:21] I said, "Son, you can just pray and God
[2:01:24] is able to bless you."
[2:01:26] Amen.
[2:01:27] Hallelujah.
[2:01:27] See, because he had an interest for it.
[2:01:30] Amen.
[2:01:31] He prayed.
[2:01:33] He prayed sincerely.
[2:01:35] Amen.
[2:01:36] And you know what happened, saints? We
[2:01:38] went to a flea market.
[2:01:40] And we're walking up the aisleway. Young
[2:01:43] people listen. walking up the aisleway
[2:01:47] and there's a guy that had some Air
[2:01:49] Force One sitting on the table
[2:01:53] and my son passed by. He looked at me. I
[2:01:56] looked at him. He went over to the table
[2:01:58] and the man asked me. He said, "What
[2:02:00] size you wear?"
[2:02:01] Oh, wow.
[2:02:01] He told him, "You want to try some on?"
[2:02:04] Cuz they always do that.
[2:02:06] He said, "Yeah, I'll try them on." So he
[2:02:08] got him and tried them on, put him on
[2:02:10] his feet, looking at him, smiling. You
[2:02:12] can see all his teeth. Amen.
[2:02:15] And I looked at him and he looked at me
[2:02:16] smiling and he took him off.
[2:02:20] It almost brought tears to my eyes to
[2:02:22] see his attitude.
[2:02:24] Cuz even though I didn't have the money
[2:02:26] to get him, he was still trying to be
[2:02:28] positive and have a right attitude and
[2:02:31] not be like a spoiled child
[2:02:33] that throws a temper tantrum when you
[2:02:35] can't get what you want.
[2:02:39] So he tried them on. He smiled. He
[2:02:41] looked at me. He put him back in the box
[2:02:43] and he gave him back to the guy and we
[2:02:45] got ready to walk off and the man
[2:02:47] stopped him. He said, "Hold on, little
[2:02:48] man."
[2:02:49] Wow.
[2:02:50] And he handed my son the box.
[2:02:54] He said, "There you go.
[2:02:56] You can have them."
[2:02:58] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:03:00] [Applause]
[2:03:09] They were a nice pair of shoes. Thank
[2:03:11] you, Lord.
[2:03:12] But what God was doing was showing him
[2:03:14] something.
[2:03:15] Yes, sir.
[2:03:16] Even though you young,
[2:03:18] I care about how much time you give to
[2:03:20] me. I care about how much confidence you
[2:03:23] have in me. I care about what you have
[2:03:25] needs of.
[2:03:26] Yes, my brother.
[2:03:27] I don't care about the shoes, but I want
[2:03:29] you to see that I'm a living God and I'm
[2:03:31] a true God.
[2:03:33] And I answer prayer.
[2:03:37] He's 23 now. He was about 8 years old
[2:03:39] then.
[2:03:41] He never forgot that testimony.
[2:03:46] He's the same God.
[2:03:47] Yes, sir. Amen.
[2:03:49] Amen.
[2:03:50] Amen.
[2:03:51] May God bless every young person that's
[2:03:53] in here.
[2:03:54] Amen.
[2:03:57] May he bless you in your heart.
[2:03:59] Amen.
[2:03:59] To gain a right focus, steadfast, and
[2:04:02] remain there. I know you're being pulled
[2:04:05] upon
[2:04:06] in all kinds of ways, but I believe the
[2:04:09] grace of God will keep you.
[2:04:11] Amen. And lead you into that fullness
[2:04:15] of what his desire is for your life.
[2:04:17] Amen.
[2:04:19] I appreciate your time, saints. Amen.
[2:04:21] Yes, sir.
[2:04:22] I pray God helps somebody tonight.
[2:04:24] Amen.
[2:04:25] Amen. I pray God helps somebody tonight
[2:04:28] because it's going home time.
[2:04:30] Yeah. and and and we we we're not where
[2:04:32] we need to be.
[2:04:34] But don't worry,
[2:04:36] we're going to get there.
[2:04:38] We're going to get there.
[2:04:40] Amen.
[2:04:40] It may be some difficult times ahead,
[2:04:43] but God has equipped you.
[2:04:45] Yes, my brother.
[2:04:46] He's equipped you to be able to come
[2:04:47] through it.
[2:04:48] Yes, sir.
[2:04:49] Amen.
[2:04:50] And to come into everything that he's
[2:04:52] spoken over your life.
[2:04:53] Yes, my brother.
[2:04:55] Hallelujah.
[2:04:55] Amen. So, have faith in God.
[2:04:58] Amen.
[2:04:59] Amen. and believe him with all of your
[2:05:00] heart.
[2:05:01] Amen.
[2:05:01] Love him with all of your heart.
[2:05:04] And we pray sometime. Let us all stand.
[2:05:06] And we pray sometime. When I pray
[2:05:08] sometimes, I say, "Lord, I love you, but
[2:05:12] I can't help but say, "But help me to
[2:05:14] love you more."
[2:05:15] Amen.
[2:05:16] Amen.
[2:05:18] Amen.
[2:05:18] Help me. Help me to love you more, Lord.
[2:05:20] Amen.
[2:05:24] Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:05:25] Amen. Let us bow. Heavenly Father,
[2:05:30] Lord Jesus, we
[2:05:33] what can we say?
[2:05:35] Hallelujah.
[2:05:36] You know all things, Father. You know
[2:05:38] each one of us,
[2:05:41] you know exactly what we need, Lord.
[2:05:45] as your word was going forth on tonight.
[2:05:47] Father God,
[2:05:50] God, I pray that you would
[2:05:53] bless that word
[2:05:55] for whatever part was for what was for
[2:05:59] for whatever individual.
[2:06:01] Many things were touched upon, Father
[2:06:03] God, but you know exactly where it was
[2:06:05] directed.
[2:06:07] And we right now pray for one another,
[2:06:09] Lord,
[2:06:10] that you would please help us, Father,
[2:06:12] those that are both here as well as at
[2:06:14] home that might be streaming in.
[2:06:19] Lord, we don't want to be slothful.
[2:06:23] But yet, we have to confess, Lord, that
[2:06:25] we have been slothful. Lord,
[2:06:27] we haven't sought you with all of our
[2:06:29] hearts, Lord.
[2:06:31] We haven't come after you, Father God,
[2:06:34] with the intensity
[2:06:36] that you desire for us to Lord.
[2:06:40] Even though your servant Paul, Father,
[2:06:42] you brought him into so many things, he
[2:06:44] attain he attained such heights
[2:06:47] spiritually speaking, Father God,
[2:06:51] as it pertains to your kingdom, Lord.
[2:06:53] His personal life just changed in such a
[2:06:55] way.
[2:06:57] But he himself, Father God, even a even
[2:07:00] even after coming so far, Lord God, from
[2:07:03] where he was to where you brought him
[2:07:05] to, he said himself, he counted himself
[2:07:07] not to have attained already.
[2:07:12] But there was something on the inside of
[2:07:14] him that caused him to press.
[2:07:18] He said, "I press forward.
[2:07:21] I'm not satisfied,
[2:07:24] but I desire to apprehend that in which
[2:07:26] I'm apprehended by.
[2:07:31] [Music]
[2:07:35] Lord, even as our prophet taught us,
[2:07:40] it shows where we are
[2:07:43] according to how we respond to certain
[2:07:45] things that come up in our lives,
[2:07:48] our reactions,
[2:07:50] the fear that grips us,
[2:07:54] the doubt that arises,
[2:07:58] the confession
[2:08:00] that we begin to confess at times that's
[2:08:03] not pleasing to you, Lord.
[2:08:06] They're all results, Father God, of a
[2:08:08] slack hand,
[2:08:12] dealing with things that pertains to
[2:08:14] your kingdom, Father God,
[2:08:17] in a slothful way.
[2:08:21] We're your people, Lord, but we need
[2:08:22] help.
[2:08:25] We need your help, Father God. Help us
[2:08:27] to humble ourselves.
[2:08:30] Help us Lord to surrender.
[2:08:33] [Music]
[2:08:35] Help us to yield.
[2:08:39] Help us to die.
[2:08:41] Lord,
[2:08:43] there's so much going on all around us.
[2:08:46] Lord,
[2:08:48] [Music]
[2:08:51] many times, Father God, we we feel many
[2:08:53] stresses and strains and troubles.
[2:08:57] We have loved ones, Lord God, that that
[2:09:00] we're praying for and so many things,
[2:09:02] Lord, happening amongst those that we
[2:09:05] really care for. And at the same time,
[2:09:07] so many things happening within our own
[2:09:09] lives. Lord, we realize we can't do this
[2:09:11] on our own.
[2:09:14] But Lord, you allow every bit of it,
[2:09:16] Father God, to bring us into that place,
[2:09:19] that special place
[2:09:23] to where we'll cry out to you, Lord.
[2:09:28] We'll begin to seek you more sincerely.
[2:09:30] Father God, we'll enter into a more
[2:09:33] consecrated walk. Father,
[2:09:36] you allow that pressure to come and you
[2:09:38] you allow it to bear down more and more
[2:09:41] and more and more. Many times we feel
[2:09:43] like we're being pressed beyond our
[2:09:45] limitations.
[2:09:48] But even though we feel that way,
[2:09:50] everything is under control.
[2:09:52] You won't put no more on us than we can
[2:09:54] bear.
[2:10:00] So when the enemy begins to make us feel
[2:10:03] like we can't take no more, Lord, we
[2:10:06] pray that by your grace you would reveal
[2:10:08] to our hearts. Comfort us by the
[2:10:10] revelation of your word.
[2:10:15] Help us to settle down. Relax us, Lord.
[2:10:21] as we continue to go through this trial,
[2:10:23] Father God, because we realize by what
[2:10:25] your prophet taught us that these trials
[2:10:28] have ordained times and seasons. We're
[2:10:31] not going to come out of it no sooner.
[2:10:34] [Music]
[2:10:36] Then we need to, Lord, you're not here
[2:10:39] just to make us feel all comfortable and
[2:10:41] good all the time.
[2:10:44] It takes the strain, as your prophet
[2:10:46] said. It takes the pressure. It takes
[2:10:48] the tears.
[2:10:52] They're just birth pains that we're
[2:10:54] experiencing
[2:10:57] because there is something that's
[2:10:58] arising in us that desires expression.
[2:11:02] [Music]
[2:11:05] Pains to be delivered.
[2:11:11] Help us to have a diligent hand, Lord.
[2:11:15] Hallelujah.
[2:11:17] We thank you for all things, Father. We
[2:11:19] thank you for being with us.
[2:11:21] Thank you, Lord.
[2:11:21] You've been with us the whole time.
[2:11:23] Amen. Amen. Amen. I'm sorry, Father, for
[2:11:26] keeping your children at length tonight,
[2:11:30] Lord,
[2:11:31] but God, may the purpose in which you
[2:11:34] brought the word, Lord,
[2:11:37] may the realization of that, Father God,
[2:11:42] just begin to move,
[2:11:45] move through the hearts of your
[2:11:46] children.
[2:11:48] We need more desperation, Lord.
[2:11:51] We need it, Father God.
[2:11:54] Thank you for how you're dealing with
[2:11:56] us, Lord. Help us to commit all things
[2:11:59] unto you.
[2:12:01] Bless everyone that's here.
[2:12:04] Bless those that are not here, Lord.
[2:12:05] Your bride around the world.
[2:12:07] Amen.
[2:12:08] You're dealing with us in the exact way
[2:12:10] that we stand in need of, Lord.
[2:12:14] Thank you, Father.
[2:12:16] We love you, Lord. and help us to love
[2:12:19] you more.
[2:12:21] In the mighty name of our Lord and
[2:12:22] Savior Jesus Christ, we ask these things
[2:12:26] and we pray. Let the church say, "Amen."
[2:12:29] Amen.
[2:12:31] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[2:12:38] [Applause]
[2:12:41] [Music]
[2:12:44] Jesus
[2:12:46] Holy,
[2:13:00] brother. Amen.
[2:13:03] Listen to your hearts tonight.
[2:13:05] Amen. We want to just respond and just
[2:13:08] yield ourselves back to him. We We can't
[2:13:11] live on our victories from yesterday and
[2:13:14] from last year. You have to have a new
[2:13:18] victory every day. And that the Lord is
[2:13:21] not allowing us to sit and relax, say,
[2:13:23] "Well, we we did all of that." Like I
[2:13:25] speaking to a brother today about dying
[2:13:27] out to self and crucifying the old man
[2:13:30] is not a one-time thing. You don't just
[2:13:33] crucify him and say, "Well, it's over."
[2:13:34] No. Every day, every day. May God help
[2:13:37] us to be diligent. I want to sing this
[2:13:40] chorus
[2:13:42] asking the Lord to do something new in
[2:13:45] my life. Yesterday is gone. Yesterday's
[2:13:49] victories are beautiful, but we need a
[2:13:52] new experience every day. Amen.
[2:13:56] Hallelujah.
[2:13:59] Do something new
[2:14:03] in my life.
[2:14:07] Something new
[2:14:09] in my life.
[2:14:12] Something new.
[2:14:15] Sing as a prayer to the Lord.
[2:14:18] Oh Lord, do something new. Lord, do
[2:14:24] something new
[2:14:27] in my life.
[2:14:30] Something new
[2:14:33] in my life.
[2:14:36] something new
[2:14:39] in my life.
[2:14:42] Oh,
[2:14:44] yesterday's gone.
[2:14:47] Yesterday
[2:14:50] is gone.
[2:14:53] Another day
[2:14:56] has come.
[2:15:00] do
[2:15:02] something new
[2:15:05] in
[2:15:07] my life.
[2:15:10] Yesterday
[2:15:13] is gone.
[2:15:16] Another day
[2:15:19] has come
[2:15:21] [Music]

[2:15:24] something new
[2:15:27] in my life.

[2:16:09] Something new
[2:16:12] in my life.
[2:16:14] [Music]
[2:16:16] I can't live without you, Lord. We call
[2:16:19] as my pastor. Cannot live
[2:16:23] without you.
[2:16:26] I just can't live
[2:16:29] without you, Lord. I can't live
[2:16:35] without you.
[2:16:38] Oh Lord,
[2:16:43] I cannot walk
[2:16:46] without you.
[2:16:49] I can't talk
[2:16:52] without you.
