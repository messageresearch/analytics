oh lee [Music] all things possible [Music] only believe [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] lord i believe [Music] foreign lord i am [Music] to let's go straight to our scriptures ephesians 5 verse 14 ephesians chapter 5 verse 14. we will be reading in the name of jesus christ not sure if you're ready if you gather you can say amen to your people ephesians 5 verse 14. everybody there okay wherefore he said awake that that slithers and arise from the dead and christ shall give the light you might be seated for the priest and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the lord shall rise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee prayer those that are streaming they are still connected with thee father we're coming as we are together knowing that in you we have solution to all problems that's the reason why we are thanking you tonight that knowing that we will not return to our respective place the same as we came in here father we believe that something will take place in our life tonight that's why we are thanking you lord please take the [Music] father we rebuke every demonic spirit that is contrary to the holy ghost unto our own knowledge and we command them to depart from this place in the name of jesus christ father together we are surrendering ourselves unto thee get done as we say the refounder said unto us may only the holy spirit take liberty in this church for everyone that is listening in their heart [Music] may you come and speak to us tonight in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you all tonight we thank you all musician and i want to thank also our pastor who said but every time he's bringing a minister whether it's a local or outside minister duties a person you see everybody that has been ministering through this church they always build up upon something in this church and we are all benefiting from there and we are growing [Music] may the lord bless our pastor for that spirit of simplicity amen amen if you notice on our scripture tonight uh we started with ephesians five verse fourteen nunavut musa [Music] my subject tonight is awake that that sleepeth arise from the dead and christ shall give thee light [Music] the same scripture is in romans 13 verse 11 [Music] that it is very important that you know the time that we are living in is the time to awake from sleep every prayer they know for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed in verse 12 he said the night is first spent the day is a hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light brothers and sisters in the lord [Music] the lord jesus christ is calling each one of us tonight that we must wake up because we are living in such a treacherous time and the bible says that we must awake because we are sleeping like dead people amen amen [Music] let me read something in second peter verse 3 uh chapter 3 verse 9 to 10 the bible says this [Music] the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some man counts likeness but he's long suffering to orders [Music] not willing that any should perish [Music] but that all should come to repentance [Music] but the day of the lord will come as a fifth in the night the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements are met with fervent heat and the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up [Music] if you notice here it is not the will of god for any to perish god doesn't want anybody to remain in sin [Music] you will even notice when you start in the book of genesis donate or friends and friends when they both offered their offering unto the lord with evil friends the god granted to the offering of evil and the bible stated that can't change his countenance and if you notice before even can kill his brother if you notice in the scriptures god came first to warn him and god begin to deal with him why are you angry angry if you did something that is wrong you all you need to do is just fix it but can't and that's the same thing the scripture is telling us today that it is not god doesn't want to lose anybody god want that everybody repent but the nature of men god does man doesn't want to hurt them that's why we face lot of issue in our lives amen amen israel that's a party in the church israel and the uh and the church in the in the sermon israel and the church part five which in 1953 march the 29th tell a paragraph in paragraph 127. let's prophet the decency brother brandon says this is your condition tonight accept that deliverance you have to accept your deliverance according to the things you are facing you need to take possession of your inheritance always remind us that every problem or situation in this life the scripture says for instance that no matter should be taken into account unless we have two or three witnesses lost from the dead number one you must take conscience of your situation you must wake up from your situation you must wake up from that sleepness that got you and that number two you must rise amen but you must move on and take possession father the wind you face no matter this problem you face but brother branham said you must stand and you must possess your possessions the bible said that arise and shine for that light is come because isaiah is speaking about the restoration of jerusalem if you take maybe abraham or something so but you must be the one replacing abraham tonight by your life amen amen glory glory be to preach in 1963 in november uh 1963 in paragraph 105 [Music] i'm just going to read something just a glance today that human beings are always telling what god did and what we believe what's going in what god is going to do but always forgetting what he is doing oh you that you are not living in the times of abraham and david and the author you are not even in your future yet together you are still living in the present and our time is a present time [Music] he wants to be called the on-time god and you one day [Music] and the lord explained to moses that i would like to deliver my people okay moses says okay may god jesus but when i got there over the monday get down israel will question me who is that god that sent me what is the name that i shall give israel about the god do you know how god answered moses he said moses if they ask you my name tell them he never says i will send me jesse but i am sent me one day he was with his disciples and he could talk to them with a different uh parable and things like that and he was talking to them about the father all the time but you know one day something happened the discipline disappeared the disciple says that's good master everything you have been preaching to us about the father that's yours but today we are tired of hearing my father my father you are tired of you talking about your father show us the father and that will satisfies us and that is what is written in the scripture so i don't know the condition felt oh you are behaving like somebody who's in the future the future does not belong to you the future belongs to god god knows what is coming up on the future god knows what is going to happen tomorrow so the future belongs to god not you it does not belong to you you you need to live on your time and the god of the present time and jesus gave the disciple an answer he said philip it has been so long [Music] that within my flesh here if you see me you see the father amen amen the one that knows the father is the same one that came down that's why the people got trouble [Music] when the woman at the world told him you know this is the the well our father jacob he said it's good you can talk about abraham your father but let me tell you guys the day your father abraham saw me they said he was so happy they looked at him they said you're not even 50 years old [Music] are you talking about you being with abraham just to show you that he is the i am the god of power [Music] you must believe the word of god you must believe the promises of god amen amen the prophet the job brother branham spoke about job amen amen explained something very good about job equity listen to this in the message here that is in you paragraph 183 the one who was in job was greater than the skin worms and death and the grave an effect [Music] in my nobody came here to declare unto jobs let's go to job job chapter there job chapter 2. all i wanted to tell you is nobody put those words in the mouth of job job himself nobody confessed for job he didn't he was the one confessing his own problem amen amen just like you you must confess for your own life in the bible the bible says that at the beginning god created the heaven and earth so with what did god created amen i'm asking you the question what did god use to create amen amen god is the word and at let me help somebody who is discouraged tonight in the beginning god created the heaven and earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the dead and the spirit of god move upon the face of the world now listen to this verse 3 and god says let there be light and there was [Music] when you go to proverbs chapter 2 i believe the book of prophecy for example we probably proverbs 18 instead verse 17 verse 21 the bible says this death and lies are in the power of the tongue and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof so you must first believe we know that and i'm going back to genesis 1 3. prayer the bible says god created but he spoke when he spoke and things came to existence brother branham explained [Music] but god believed his own word amen amen when god believed his own word then he came to manifestation in the beginning was the word the second book you already know about it amen amen in the beginning and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god now listen to verse three all things were made even you and me it is the word of god that created us today we have books and sermons so what is in these books and sermons he was first a spoken word by a prophet we have believed the spoken word of a prophet brother branham believed the spoken word of god and god told him that take the pen take a purpose and write this and by the problem and brother believe on what he wrote and brother branham received the benefit of the word and we have it in books and tapes and tapes and that same word is in the bible but what is the bible the bible is god's spoken word amen amen but where is your situation the quran god only asks you to believe 1821. 21. so god took the power of death and laughs and put it on your tongue if you want to change your life and it's going to change your situation i begin maybe you are appending saturdays i don't care what your name is but i'm just commending you in the name of jesus christ leave my body now [Laughter] i have dedicated it for the service of god i must preach tonight so there is no way you can come and stand on my way brothers and sisters i'm raising my hand tonight as a testimony and on the bible and it happened to me in the same moment he was gone amen you see now i refuse i [Applause] just like i told you about my high blood pressure every time i became like a slave of checking my blood pressure i said stop genesis please i will not again do that today i don't have any problem i don't take any medication nothing amen you must speak tonight to your problem we came in the house of the lord in the house of her father you must talk to our father very importantly no matter the situation that is happening amen amen the problem the problem is this [Music] is difficulty many children of god found themselves cornered in difficult situations malagrasela and despite that ely continues under me they are still sleeping and getting used to that condition so they are they they have been put to sleep by the enemy the enemies are following you see brothers and sisters the word of god that you must awake and you must rise so that god can give you light when we speak the word god hears you it's your regard and god look at you tell a position what is your reaction to your confession especially do you really believe what you confess yourself or are you still looking at the symptoms or the circumstances amen are you looking at the circumstances i know that my redeemer leaveth amen amen and at the last day he will stand amen amen [Music] oh job was not dead because he stood with the position of the world a secular confession he believed what he spoke my family did remember the blasphemy even his one wife told him go ahead and curse god but job never faces tonight [Music] it's telling you that there is a lack of life somewhere amen amen so you found yourself in destruction it's always it's a sign of death amen amen so the sleep that you found yourself and you take conscience of your situation of your situation and you take conscience of your problems situation of your difficulties of your sickness of your suffering god wants to deliver you important to you no matter the reproach you're facing adam adam advertising he sinned free he ran away from god let pasteur have the mortality more she said and brother stephen explained and explained everything here that our god before he created you that was the lord jesus christ so when you say i'm not going to fail so you become a god like jesus he is the only one he is the only one that is a sinner so that you can recognize who you are so tonight no full on all we want is this the manifestation we want to see god being manifested that shows the disease we want to see visible things the second [Music] for me not for me to be suffering i must go from victory to victory i must go from victory to victory from high to height amen [Music] i want to even continue on the same thought right [Music] i said yeah let me just take a little thought first question because it was such a rich death i don't even know how to explain it because when god had all attributes in him so what you are condemning yourself tonight god already paid for it amen amen god and we need a materialization of the things visible we want to see them in our lives amen amen the prophet can we confess do you know what he was speaking in his mouth he said i see yet he was blind he said i see yet he was blind he said i see yet he was blind and the people were making fun of him and one day a barber he went back to the barbershop before they asked him again do you still believe john ryan he said yes i still believe when he said do you know what happened to him his confession his so we believe tonight you will do it i confess it you will do it jesus said jesus want to touch you [Music] god want to bring you light in a condition but there is something you must do they usually say oh my pain my diabetes my problem my problem yes there's certain problems let me ask you a question where did this start to be your problem [Applause] this is a renter a passenger that just came and he's renting a place you must kick him outside let me ask you if you have somebody renting at your property you the one that signed the contract for him to stay in your property but if you take a decision right tonight you're going to leave my property guess what he's gonna leave amen amen maybe you have a problem and you put the uh uh uh somebody there right if you decide to sell your house maybe he you have power in the word of god to speak the word and believe that word that you spoke don't move and wave here brother problem was not weathering [Music] they rise from the dead because death is a lack of life it means there is no light because death brings poverty silly major the [Music] it's bringing you maybe a state of being and you thought that condition was normal for your life but let me tell you tonight it doesn't belong to you it doesn't belong to you okay so that's not even your friend sin is not your friend difficulties are not your friends so tonight you must they say this you must claim your healing back [Music] in jesus you will see really what god did to jonah amen amen i'm not going to read a lot now the lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up jonah and jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights then jonah pray unto the lord his god out of the fish's belly let me ask you do you understand the situation jordan was in sweden listen to this verse 3 he says this for that has cast me into the future i have prayed into the lord and the lord heard me descending from the deep [Music] i called and you answered me you put me into the dip you cast me in the midst of the sins and the flood compassed me about just look at the picture that this man was in it now look at your own life and compare the two look at the situation that is that are coming left and right so there was no gps he could not see anything but he spoke to the lord in that condition how can you open your mouth in the field but even in his soul he can speak there is no wireless problem the network is always wired pretty good when god is speaking to his children that network is secure god heals and he looks at your situation he looks at the word amen what position are you taking jonah spoke in the difficult a situation where he was corner-squeezed and he says that god heard him is that god of jonah different than your god is he different than the god we worship is jonah a human being different than us he even rejected what god told him and god put him in that situation in the same thing god must hear you tonight and we saw that everything was created by the word of god [Music] and we are what we are by the message that came through brother and that word changed us and we are different than other people why because we believe in that word so you must believe the word if god could change a being like jacob how can he do the same for you we speak about the good things that those people do but they also did bad things in their lives when that deceiver met god he said i believe the word of god today i'm not going to let you go my condition must change i cannot continue always deceiving people that fifth spirit must depart that lying spirit must depart from my life the sin in my life must be important so today that sickness must leave and [Music] a man like moses a very angry man he even killed somebody in hiding amen he had his weaknesses he knew everything that egyptian taught him he had all that great knowledge he was a man that was a forceful speaker very intelligent man but when he met the pillar of fire when he met god because it says you know what i don't know how to talk he found somebody who can transform he found somebody that can change him that man is called god he is able to change you tonight he is able to change you tonight no matter your infirmities or your situation he is the master of time and circumstances he is able to change all things amen amen he changed the life of sarah he changed the story of anna he changed the story of roof bull boys if you talk to them today they will confess to you and witness that god changes that god is able to change all things all you have to do is be connected to his promises it is possible for god to work with your heart god is able to change your nature god is able to change you you must rise stop doubting amen amen rahab was a prostitute it's all written in your scripture can you imagine a woman like temer went and slept with his father-in-law he killed christian he killed servant of god amen god never looked at those situations if you read the story of those people rahab ruth paul those are the people that took a decision for their life they believed the word of their time they believed in the word of god and god changed their life and god changed their lives god changed their life all those people started bad and they succeeded if you did something wrong he's still the savior when he was looking for adam and adam was hiding god didn't have a weapon he had the lamb i didn't even read about joseph joseph to change yourself go ahead and preach joseph okay okay glory to god the lamb was already been slain before even you begin to think the lamb was already being slain amen amen but you're still living a life of condemnation amen amen why god already saved you when you are living under condemnation when brother when the pastor is preaching all his servants of god preaching god will use that channel because they are tools of god and believe that god already saved you and since he already saved you god never saved you for you to continue on your condition no maybe you did something wrong in the past and you were living under condemnation but now when you meet god god bring you pardon us god give you the lamb [Music] the reason why he's giving you that so that you cannot continue in the sinless and that you can be saved amen amen amen because we don't want people to misunderstand that oh since i'm already saved so since i know the truth now i can continue to sin no that's not what we're talking about you did something wrong in the past that's that's that that was by mistake amen if you fail you must rise the one who always stands the only one that fell and never stood was the serpent by the children of god if they found the riser they believed the word of god they believed the word of god [Applause] so god have to display his attributes he was a father amen amen when they said when they asked jesus jesus said i am the father you see me you see the father [Music] and those fruits are his children you and me if jesus was not dead [Music] he would have taken all the deity with him all the power should be gone but because the kill no witch died and rise again he gave the promises and he fulfilled the promises and that promise belongs to you it's also for me it's the promise of the holy ghost why that promise of the holy ghost so that the work that he did the church should be able to continue on the same work jesus believed his own word jesus was going somewhere and he cursed the trees because he want to eat something but he believed his word the disciple did not believe us but on the next day the disciples saw that the tree dried up and jesus told them and paul said look at the tree you cursed it's already dried up jesus always believed his word so we demonstrated here you must believe in the promises of god and the promises of god are in you now present unto god his own promises tell god that i am a sinner and your name is savior i am a sinner maybe i'm in a difficult situation but you are the answer to that situation and i know that you are able that's what we always sing here and god is still able to change your situation to change your problem to take your problem and transformatory he's still able tom is gone joseph lord glory be to god paragraph 189 198. the prophet jesus said but branham says this come to pray when you pray belief [Music] if you don't doubt it in your heart and believe that what you say happen it [Music] i say unto you the son can do nothing except he sees the father first amen so the son do likewise you see [Music] when the father shows him what to do he was moving and no arrow no failure no failure could happen he was speaking [Music] let it be and it happened and that same christ is living in you so what you can confess tonight god is duty bound to listen god this

power of god the word of god you must cast out the father you must cast out your temptation you [Applause] you are able to even restore it because you have the word that created all things and that can change and that's the word that created you and that's the word that is giving you commission and what the father was saying jesus was doing likewise and jesus went and he gave you the commission if you can send tonight it's still locking so you keep that joseph for next time we're going to pray the lord i'm going to say this jesus jesus [Music] he went at the cross to purchase something he

before the foundation of the world amen he could not display that through a crocodile he could not do it to a hippopotamus he could not even use adam you have to use the door of a woman to display his attribute amen that god is still alive it is that simple the gospel is in simplicity and the devil if you recall on sunday he attacked the gospel in simplicity and the message came in simplicity the work of god in simplicity nothing to be complicated it is right there in the scripture amen you don't have to force anything just do what god says and believe and continue to confess and it's gonna happen i've seen many things in my life that i pray and after a while i don't remember them anymore it doesn't even come up to be prayed for and after a while i will realize they were already gone

have these diseases and despite everything everybody is still alive [Music] amen amen we were coming here in the bad time through storm and everything and the lord has been faithful faithful faithful while many people died all over the world and god had protected us god had protected our families we're still strong what is dismounted before zerubbabel if god can keep you all alone the coffee that we heard in march last year and you thought the world was going to an end we all suffer from it and we pass it and now we hardly hear anything about kovid amen the mascot of the people are back on the street amen if god can do that to coffee what else can stand before god he's a god that can heal everything he can the god he's a god that can touch your car he can touch your business he can touch your home amen like i was talking to somebody going through a lot of problem i say you just take your faith and hook it to the mountain and stand right there amen jesus said even if that faith is so little like a mustard seed just hook it to the mountain you will see that big mountain being dissolved little by little and you look at your faith and you look and you say this is not me this is god that's why when the army was so big god had to weep the crowd of gideon he said if i leave them they're going to get glory on their own and with 300 people they never even fought if you look at the scripture they never even fought they only pulled their sword and hold their torches and that was it and god put confusion in the camp of the enemy and that was it the same thing happened to jehoshaphat the whole army got into confusion nobody fought why do you want to fight [Music] aren't you tired of fighting amen the holy ghost is a rest is a sabbath on the sabbath day you now you don't work you sit down and do you know what god was doing on the sabbath day do you know the manner was failing on the first day the man i was failing on the second day was falling on the third day

panic will make you lose gps and lose faith amen that's what the devil worked with when he gets you all frustrated then you're going to make more mistake more mistake and you're going to take decision in a rush and later on you sit down it's not i usually tell my wife when i come i don't open my mail [Music] when i'm tired this is just me when i'm tired i don't open the mail because i don't know
