she had a conversation with you um last week as well we've been praying and she was um we've been talking with workmen's comp and everything but there was a time limit or something so we're not relying on that anymore anyways we never were um because we know our God can can do things right so they went um was it yesterday or today Monday they went to um another person you know because they were looking at surgery so they went to another person and he started checking stuff out and he says I don't think that's a hernia he said I just don't feel that he said we can't make any kind of conclusion without a CT scan he said but I'm not feeling what that other man said he did so it's already it's already taking you know taken care of Amen so Plus the visit Monday was supposed to be

for a quick recovery she suffered for a long time but by God's grace everything is good amen brother Wayne Lawson sent me a message I believe he was on on Monday uh they had a an election in their church and now he's a pastor amen so brother Wayne you know some finally now he's a pastor amen he has been a tremendous help for the Bride of Jesus Christ I say praise the Lord amen but he was moving toward that direction for a while a long long long time until the Lord made his way and everything is good and I'm happy for him because he's a man who's solid in the word of God amen glory to God everybody on board since Sunday the Bible became more and more of a new book amen can we clear now so you continue to pray for me so we pick up again on Sunday and move forward scripture after scripture after scripture after scripture until you understand the deity of Jesus Christ now you begin to understand why Jesus is God it is now clear that Jesus was the word that was made flesh so when we say the Lord Jesus come you need to be specific if not we're going to have a cow eating grass somewhere where the cow is not supposed to be Amen brother Kalima sent me a quote when I put a coat where brother Branham said before the coming of the Lord I believe you saw the quote that California will go down was California down in 1963. you saw me highlighted on the group chat was California down so the Lord didn't come is it a problem there is a quote that people who believe that God the Lord Jesus Christ came on 1962 there is a court that they use it's a it's a popular quote among them but Lord's willing on Sunday I will pull that coat and me and you will read that quote and we'll figure it out what did Brother Branham say it I have ministers all the way from Ghana rejoicing this we we are giving them so much ammunition to be free from this kind of confusion in the message amen it's a minister he said brother Stephen who will have a minute I'll talk to the ministers meeting I mean all the minister there for the meeting to pull you out so you can come down here oh my God Amen I'm already loaded here amen so you keep praying for me I say Lord's willing but you keep me in prayer amen so keep me in prayer everything will be okay we pick up again and we go deeper it's going to stabilize you a lot in your walk in this message and then uh your shutter record everything will be okay the sisters meeting is maintained in just in case you heard something that we were trying to change the date no we did it the day to remained the 25th I was able to tweak a little bit and keep everything the way it is something slipped me up but by God's grace we work our way around so we keep it on the 25th but instead of 2 30 it will be at three o'clock you know the place I'm not gonna say it on YouTube we just meet up there amen I keep it secret it's the seventh seal it's open but it's not open to the public [Applause] when I give those kind of example it will help you catch up even the seventh seal itself that it's open but it's now open to the public so somebody really know what the seven seal is and there is a group that doesn't know amen glory to God I receive couple questions because we have question and answer this Saturday at 2 30 and they will be here in the church amen so remember 230 question and answer there are a couple people that put question on the prayer request so it's hard for me to make up the question so if you're streaming tonight or if you hear or you're going to listen later if you can text me directly because there is no name again so it's hard for me to reach out to you directly and know what you what you're trying to ask so the first question is about it's a question on marriage and divorce which is a hard one but it's put on the prayer request so if you put this question on the prayer request please you need to contact me this is pretty deep and I want to know which angle you're coming from and what are you looking at so I know what is going on because it's a hard question I don't even want to read it but you know you who wrote the question about marriage and divorce if I read it you will start thinking twice and being puzzled amen so talk to me so I know what is your question what you're asking where you're coming from so I know how to answer it if not it's going to be hard for me to make up the question the second one is in the glossy prayer request again so somebody wrote on it and some of the writing didn't come up because it's on the glossy paper one of the question was when did The Mating of sibling end so if you wrote that question whatever the remaining is I don't know so write me that it's just a question okay so send me a text I won't call your name just send me a text you say buddy Steven I am the one who asked the question and this is the question and just give me the full question then I know how to answer it there is a Biblical answer to this okay so no problem I don't mind you I asking questions versus you staying with your question and get puzzle and get on the internet and go get off foolishness amen so there are questions on the front and question on the back and it's written in two weeks so I can make it up so if you did it do it in other words the message is we got paper there use the paper that are there write your question there and put your name there so when I have a question I will directly contact you and I know who wrote it everybody clear everybody clear amen glory to God Amen keep me in prayer and just be a little be patient I will tell you when we will have our normal voting for the officer of the church I'm going through a lot of meeting because I need to set things in uh we restructure a lot of things in a different order the Lord is already pleased with the order that we get up here but I want to really set it up pretty tight so when we know we know which direction we're moving and no more guessing of things like that because the Lord doesn't tolerate that anymore so I'm going through one meeting to another to one meeting to another just trying to put things together so you keep me in prayer and you will be updated and from there we go to the voting and loads willing probably toward the end of the month you get the receipt for your taxes and everything I believe it's pretty much set we just need the premiere legibly on the church logo and everything and give it to you amen so be patient with me I am not the one preaching tonight if you already check it on YouTube brother said is preaching tonight so he's both musician and preacher and I don't know how many quality the Lord put but as much as the Lord will unfold we let it go hey man amen you can be a deacon and a preacher there's nothing wrong there's nothing wrong with it amen I am a pastor you know the gift God put in me you need quote I show you amen I was trying to put it up last night and brother Branham was speaking and he mentioned something that made me stop and I pulled all those score down this is not what brother Bradham was saying he was matching completely what I was doing because when I'm when I'm working on your sermon on the sermon brother Branham is completely playing whichever messages and I can tell you like 90 of the time what comes on the tip it's also right there that's when I know the direction and if something comes up there and say don't do this to you it's don't do this to me it's but God is telling me move to a different direction so he moved it last night so I have to retrieve some quotes and remove it okay so you pray for me everything will be okay only believe he's right here so he's going to get on fire soon amen Lee believe [Music] oh We Believe all things are possible please oh holy believe [Music] oh holy believe all things are possible oh Lord I believe tonight oh Lord I believe [Music] Lord Lord I believe all things are possible Lord [Music] I believe oh Lord I believe Lord Lord I

control tonight Lord we thank you we bless you in Jesus Christ let me pray amen and amen amen can we just take out our scriptures thank you musicians amen amen I'm so sorry I just went straight into it I should have released them to go sit down but forgive me amen I will take Psalms 27. amen psalm 27. amen Psalm 27 said the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid can we be seated may the Lord add His blessings to the reading tonight amen I don't know um how the Lord touched my heart to take this scripture to preach amen one of the scriptures we are going to read tonight but then I just want to thank God that I am standing here tonight I've been I've been in bed since last night to about two hours ago I was not able to even stand on my feet I was not able to walk but then two hours ago the Lord did something miraculous amen and if you see me stand here tonight oh the Lord is our light and our Salvation who shall We Fear amen amen [Applause] I don't know this sometimes the Lord put scripture on your heart and then he has to take you through something and then the scripture becomes living in your life it is no more a dead letter but a living life of the spirit in the word of God amen this morning I sent brother Stephen a text message that I needed prayer amen uh I don't know I don't know what the Lord has for us tonight that the devil was trying to fight since last night but the Lord is going to speak his word tonight amen so just pray for me tonight amen it is no brother said that is going to speak but is the Lord Jesus Christ that is going to speak to us tonight amen amen so back to Psalm 27 he said the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is a strength of my life the Lord is the one who gave me the strength to come to stand here tonight amen of whom shall I be afraid he said when the wicked even my enemies and my thoughts Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though and hosts shouldn't come against me my heart shall not fear the world should rise against me in this will I be confident and what will I be confident that the Lord is my life and my is the light it's my light and my salvation he is the strength of my life and this will I be confident amen it's a one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple that is what I have desired in my heart to be in the house of the Lord to be in the temple to inquire in his in his Temple he said for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon the rock in the secret of his Tabernacle there's a secret place in the Tabernacle that he hides me there's no eyes can see me but Steven was talking about the the fourth stage right that has to do with rewarding when it gets to that rewarding eyes will not see you amen and and I was I was just sometimes you you you just think about when the prophet was preaching about uh my speech on this message the rapture he was written in psalm 27. so I was like okay so I'm 27 how is this connected to the rapture he's hiding me in that secret place there is a secret place that the eyes cannot see amen amen the Thunders in the word of God amen amen I said for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock I said and now shall my head be lifted up you remember Psalm 24 lift up your heads all you get amen and now so my head be lifted up above my enemies run about me therefore will I offer in his stabilical sacrifices of Joy I will sing yeah I will sing praises unto the Lord amen and amen amen I as I said the Lord just gave me strength two hours ago to come stand here I wasn't able to walk I wasn't I was just bed reading but um somewhere somehow the lawyers provided the strength just to come to say his word tonight so um we're gonna see what the Lord has for us tonight amen amen he amen we want to see how the Lord is going to take us tonight amen sometimes you have thoughts you have scriptures you have quotes um and you need a lot to line them up amen the Lord must present a message amen the message for tonight is a preserved generation a preserved generation amen amen now um in um when I was in um fifth grade in in Ghana we we do this uh the system we call it the primary school so uh fifth grade in Ghana um we went for a program and I was back then in the nomination and when I went for this program I a good um I I sought this um sisters this um young girls from a school in Ghana called Goshen and it's it's a school that that was established by a message believer is is actually a pastor so back then uh my first impression that I had about Goshen was is this peculiar people um you see the sisters the kind of peculiar to the ones that you already know the ones you've been exposed to the kind of people that looked preserved the kind of people that look classy the kind of people that looked I don't know what kind of words to use but you could see the glory of the Lord you could see the glow and that that impression I still have that impression to today amen so it's a way to encourage encourage our sisters sometimes you might you might you might think that okay things are so hard things are so difficult they they are I'm expected to do this I'm I'm expected to present myself in a certain way it is looking like rules and regulations but then the impression that you are creating out there amen it's it's a different kind of impression it's a classic they glow amen amen I still have that impression in my head so finally when I got into the message and then I heard about the school again then that open my understanding to why the school was called Goshen amen I believe we've heard about um Goshen in the Bible it was a place that the Lord preserved his people no matter the storms in Egypt whatever was going on in Egypt every plague no matter how the plagues came in there was a preserved place for the people of God amen and that's a it's our topic tonight A preserved generation let's go to John 15. I have a lot of codes to read but I want to take some of the scriptures before we get to the quotes and I I prayed the Lord give us Grace I want to read amen John chapter 15 verses 1 to 10. the Bible says I am the True Vine and my father is the husband man every branch in me that buried not fruit he take it away and every branch that buried fruit he perjured it that it may bring forth more fruit amen every Branch he said I am the True Vine so the prophet was saying that their Vine does not produce fruit it is the branch that produce the fruit so God needs us to be branches to produce fruits and they say now when you don't produce the fruit he's going to take you off but when you're producing the fruit he's going to praise you what is purging purging is a cleaning up amen he's he's taking certain things off you so that you produce more fruit so when there is something that is in your life that is blocking the Holy Spirit from producing the fruit he must take them off so that he can produce more fruit amen there are things in our lives amen when we got converted or when we gave our lives to Christ I believe it was not um you didn't you were not bearing all the fruit at the beginning there are certain things that were still lingering in your life but then Christ must come in and preach those things off amen so those those days when when you when you give your life to Christ there are still certain friends that you still hang around with a man I I just have a little confession tonight amen when I got into the message first um uh you know you still had the Presbyterian friends that that were still inviting youth for programs amen amen and then um you would go you go to these programs and then um they say oh it's been a long time I've not seen you um where have you been I'm just just around and and I've been around you know I've been around so it's okay we what child do you go to now is that go to spoken word smoking is this Spoken Word Ministries spoken I just go to spoken word amen at that time you were not well equipped amen you were not equipped enough to speak about the message amen you still have things in your life that the Lord must come to purge you amen so when your life is still like the beginning when when you are five years ten years and your life is still like that then it means there's no purging that is going on in your life Christ is not having enough room to operate in your life amen you come to church you are serving in church amen you give a little of your time in church Christ must urge you to serve more there must be a president amen maybe you sing specials once in a while once a year amen there must be a president amen yeah you move from once a year to five times a year to 10 times a year to every week that we know the Lord is bearing fruit because you are the branch that the Lord must bear fruit amen amen now verse three he said now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you so the word of God comes to clean us up to purchase so that Christ can bear fruit amen he said abide in me am I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the Vine no more can ye accept he abide in me so it means even though we are the branch that we have to bear the fruit we can bear the fruit of our own self but the vine must bear the fruit through us we must be connected to Christ each and every day of Our Lives to be able to bear this fruit amen so when I come here to sing special it is not me trying to show that I can sing but it is Christ amen that is singing and special amen when I stand yet to preach it is not brother trying to say something but it must be Christ that is speaking amen amen said I am Divine ye are the branches he that abided in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit the word is much fruit you must be pushed to produce much fruit it's not just producing fruit but much fruit amen so we don't just spend um just a few hours you know uh just come to church on Sundays and that's it I mean when they actually do you go to church oh yeah I I do come to church amen and and your church going is on on Sundays amen when we are bearing much fruit this place will be filled up on Wednesday night amen because Bible says forsake not they are sampling of the Saints amen the prophet said you can miss work but you can miss coming to church you can miss it amen amen so we must bear much fruit for except for without me he can do nothing so bearing of much fruit we must be in that vine amen if a man abide not to me he is cast forth as a branch and it's Wizard and Men gathered them and cast them into the fire and they are burned they are burnt amen if he abide in me and my words are bite in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you if ye abide in me and my words in you you shall ask anything and it shall be done ask anything for what you are asking is a word of God that is in you that is asking so you are not going to ask and miss you are not going to pray and miss you are going to ask best on the word of God that is in you amen hearing is my father glorified ah hearing is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples as the father have loved me so have I loved you continue ye in my love the same love he said if you keep my Commandments he shall abide in my love even as I have kept my father's Commandments and abide in his love amen so keeping the word of God is so important in bearing much fruits and abiding in the Father's Love in order to show the glory of the father amen now I want to take this quote from the prophet I said um perseverance preacher 1962 he said now see the Bible said Abraham started not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong giving praise to God said now if we are in Christ we are Abraham's seat and I asked with him according to the promise is that right amen he said then how could the true Abraham's seat he see the promise of God here and then complain about having a tummy ache oh amen all your hand ain't straightening out right yet when God made the promise amen amen he said if you wait 50 years what difference does it make now I was listening to a message one time the prophet was talking about when God gives a promise the promise is leaving with him he's seen the promise from the beginning to the end he's seeing them at the same time but with us it takes long and then he made an illustration let's say um we have an aunt that is moving from um Gastonia to maybe uh uh let's say Mint Hill meant here it's going to take years for that ant to get to Mint Hill but with us we can just get into a vehicle and drive within an hour we are there and that is how the promises of God are leaving it's it's just within a short word to God so when God made that promise the Fulfillment is at the same time God is seeing the promise and the Fulfillment at the same time but with us we seek to belong we see to take several years so we come to God and said okay I prayed about this I prayed about that I prayed about this and it's taking two years it's taken three years it's taking five years with God he's saying it at the same time the same time he gave the promise that's the same time he's in the Fulfillment so when you come to God and say God I prayed about this I prayed about this five years ten years I'm still not seeing it God is like I'm still seeing the Fulfillment of the promise so when he said you are healed by his stripes and you were healed God is seeing your healing but because we are in this flesh this flesh makes it so long it becomes so delayed and you're seeing it five years ten years 15 years but God is seeing the Fulfillment of that promise amen said Abraham was able to achieve the title of father of Nations and have the child because he believed and was perseverant with his faith he said why he could be persevered God had promised it he was persuaded fully that God was able to perform that what he had said oh my how can the Seed of Abraham the Royal Seed of Abraham the Church of the Living God look upon a promise and then don't believe it I said God's Eternal Word I am Divine ye are the branches see if he abide in me and my word in you ask what you will and it will be done for you see oh what promises he gives us we could cut them but you can only be perseverant when you got a hold of the word amen when you get a hold of that word you can only be perseverant when the word is not in there you can't persevere when the word is pro is pointing you to the to the Fulfillment of that word you are looking at the Fulfillment and you are going to hold on to the word until that fulfillment is done so that is going to make you persevere amen because the word is abiding in you but if there's no word in there there's no Focus there's no vision you are not looking at an aim you're not looking at a fulfillment amen so you're going to lose hope amen amen you can only persevere when you are looking at the Fulfillment of that vision amen amen that's yes there's always a Target to look at amen Lord help me amen now I want to take um I hope I'm within time amen this uh from the message God commissioning Moses preaching 53 he said if we can have faith now for healing how are we going to have rapturing faith brother Brown said hmm just like how you say he said we've got to have faith for the little things first before the great things we must have faith for Divine Healing we must have faith for the Fulfillment of every promise of God before we have that rapturing faith that is taking us to the rapture we must have faith for the little things first before they create things amen you must have faith that the Lord is going to pay those bills amen you must have faith that the Lord is going to provide the food on your table amen you must have faith that the Lord is going to take care of your kids you must have faith that the Lord is going to heal your diseases amen before we start thinking about the Rapture faith that is taking us to the rapture amen he said so there will be something that will cause he said that's on that's in God's Providence I do not know but I seen a demonstration of it recently and that's what I want to tell you about then when God sent this little fellow Moses talking about Moses he was one kind of an odd birth and in a peculiar time it was more like a squeeze you know about the story amen that they had to go and hide him Amen in on the water in the basket amen amen and God hid him away it was God's election and calling Amen to send Moses down there Moses couldn't help because he was Moses he said Moses couldn't help because he was Moses amen I am brother said I can't help amen because I'm sad amen God has to take care of it that's how God has has called me that's how God has elected me amen and I can't help because this is me amen he said but how God preserved his life it was predestination and fro ordained will of God and then when he finally got him into the desert to her the Sheep of Jethro after he had become a murderer then one day God spoke to him in a burning bush God told him to take off his shoes amen remember Brian Stevens preaching on taking off your shoes amen that the Lord himself will come and step in those shoes amen amen said God told him to take off his shoes for the ground was holy where he stood and how that God LED that church in the natural it's a perfect type of the spiritual he's leading it today he brought out Israel the natural by signs wonders and miracles he brings out the spiritual in this day Saints wonders miracles God has always they've always accompanied God because God is Supernatural he is a creator amen if God LED them by signs and wonders and miracles in those days he is doing the same thing today amen if God healed diseases in those days he's doing the same thing today if God provided for them in those days he's doing the same thing today amen there's nothing impossible to him and when a man becomes born again of the spirit of God he becomes an offspring or a son of God Amen amen and then he has the same type of of mind that God does the mind that was in Christ is in US and we believe for the Unseen for the miraculous amen amen he said and just anything see and then we have the Holy Spirit who bring or comes to us and speaks to us concerning these things the Holy Spirit comes and reminds us that he is doing the same thing today amen he said and that's the whole purpose of these meetings dear Christian friend it's for no other purpose before God but that your faith in God might be stimulated to a place to believe him for the Salvation of your soul and for the healing of your body amen now this is a question and answers in 52 he said if you are filled with the Holy Ghost this morning or this evening and God's power is moving in every fiber of your body what good would it do for you to stand in the judgment he said you're already charged and been received and filled and already translated into Heavenly places with Christ Jesus there's already an inner translation as we learned on Sunday there's already an inner translation amen which you project to the outward translation amen he said you've already been translated into Heavenly places we are sitting here in Heavenly places with Christ Jesus he said not you will be said you aren't now right now translated amen amen Those whom he called he justified Those whom he justified he glorified and every redeemed person in the world this evening that's under the blood of Jesus Christ filled with the Holy Ghost have everlasting life and can't perish and it's already in Heavenly places with Christ Jesus and shall never come into condemnation already redeemed isn't that wonderful amen amen Prophet said isn't that wonderful [Music] amen it's it's it's just so beautiful amen when you're just when you're just reading these love letters love stories to the bride amen that was brought by whom the son of man himself amen giving you the love stories amen amen amen amen so Jesus said that oh the scripture says that all the writers poor he said Those whom he justified he had already glorified Those whom he for ordained he predestinated Those whom he predestinated he justified Those whom he justified he has already glorified what is it oh my said already glorified then if we are filled with the Holy Ghost our fibers any beings have already been preserved in God if we have the Holy Ghost our fibers our beings have already been preserved in God amen there is a glorified party already waiting we've already been preserved in God but then he said there is a glorified body already waiting laughs he said and you have to go to read as soon as this is over Those whom he has Justified he's already glorified he's already done it but we are going through it [Laughter] amen this is so beautiful what I was saying a while ago the negative and positive wish I had the education I mean I'm just going to skip that a man for time's sake amen amen Lord help me he said oh when Atomic Powers this in um beginning and ending of the Gentile dispensation in 55. he said oh when Atomic Powers begin to shake I'm so happy that the word of God has tell us where to go to it's a flee to The Rock Christ Jesus every man in it is safe and secured nothing can harm you no atomic bombs no Cobalts nothing else can touch the preserved of God amen safe secure anchored amen what a marvelous hope that we have in Christ Jesus notice there was a man with him he's seven spiritual boy walked and poured water on the hands of the prophet a great position he had but when he seen the Syrian Ahmed he's talking about gassy and uh exactly but when he's in the Syria Army All Around Dalton had it all backed up he said my father look out there what a great number why we are surrounded now that's the natural when everything seems to go wrong pointing their finger at you saying this and that and the doctor says you can't get well and so forth that's just the natural thing for you to think oh my This Is the End this is just speaking to me amen I was I was I was talking to my wife this morning I'm like how on Earth am I going to be on the pulpit tonight good amen amen if I said it's just the natural amen he said but Elijah said there is more with us than there is with them [Music] there is more with us than it is with them amen I said now you can imagine how that Prophet or that gehazi felt the servant he looked over at him he said why I don't see nobody amen I don't see nobody because in the natural you don't see nobody amen I said God open this boy's eyes amen amen and as soon as God did something here it is get it when God opened his spiritual sight all around there the prophet stood Chariots of Fire and angels of fire why he's seen the Chariots of Fire outnumbered that Syrian Army by the thousands the mountains was on fire angels of fire horses of fire Chariots of it was on fire around him amen just the same tonight said I wonder what would happen if a man here tonight had the power to strike across your eyes amen you are in distress you are going through your own challenges you're going to depressions and all that the prophet is saying that he wishes tonight that a man strike across your eyes and say look standing around this time like tonight you would be a member here the rest of your life sure yes sir sometimes you can't see it with your natural eyes but you can feel the impulse of it something near a success that denotes something is near amen sometimes you're going through all your challenges your your distress and all those things but then God will just bring a feeling to you that Sixth Sense that his presence is here amen amen God help me amen this from the message power of transformation God likes to be worshiped so God likes to be worshiped I'll repeat that again remember Sunday president talks about worshiping amen when somebody comes to worship let us all be in worship amen it it shouldn't be just the person saying I thank the Lord and I'm singing to thank God let us all be in that Spirit of worship and we as a United Army are thanking God and worshiping God we are not just looking at the person thanking God but we are thanking God for the life of the person amen when I get healed it's like you getting healed amen because if if I am not healed I can't stand here tonight and we can't benefit from what is going on if if the pastor is going through something and he doesn't have the grace of God that comes to him we are all going to we are going to get affected amen amen so so so when when the Lord keeps him it is a victory for all of us amen so when he comes and he's given a testimony we must all share in that testimony amen so God likes to be worshiped and when you worship Him it just isn't exactly singing a song as we do amen it's not it isn't exactly singing a song as we do but singing it in the spirit of worship I am singing a song in the spirit of worship you see I said then you feel the Holy Spirit bounce back when you're singing in the spirit of worship then the Holy Spirit comes in amen say and I see great big young men here just think of the day that group of young fellows sitting there young boys and their little wives sitting along there and big rough men sitting there and just cry like little babies why look at today they are out there on the street living in adultery and filth of the world and things amen this was in 65. I just wonder how how the prophet would have said it in this day amen amen and and to think that you can come apart and gather like this whereas the psalmist said behold how sweet and pleasant for breathing to dwell together in unity it's like the anointing oil that was on Aaron's beard that ran to the hands of His Garment amen which that anointing oil you know what the anointing oil done he said he preserved him to go in the presence of God so when the church is United when the church is in the spirit of unity it gives the minister an oil of preservation to come to the presence of God wow when the Brethren are united in one Accord in one Spirit of the word it preserved the minister to come to the presence of the Lord amen that is why we fight that Spirit of Discord when it comes amen we pray against it amen amen so it's like the anointing oil that was on Aaron's beard that ran to the hems of His Garment which that's anointing oil you know what's the anointing oil done it present him to go in the presence of God see he had to be anointed without oil before he went in the presence of God and when Brethren can do well together in unity it's liking unto that oil we then enter into the presence of the Lord with that anointing of Brethren together in unity oil represents the Holy Spirit amen we are talking about a preserved generation so when Brethren are united in one spirit in one Accord it gives the minister a preserved oil a preserved the minister to come in the presence of the Lord amen now this is the Harvest Time in 64. I should be closing very short amen it's a nature speaks that this same seed went in the ground the same seed comes up again it's talking about when you put when you're planting a seed Amen in the ground he said the same seed comes up again it says see the same Jesus went down is the same Jesus come back Hallelujah and this body when it falls into the ground it will not come back a flower or something else it will come back a man or a woman you see it in nature how it does it has to go through the cold Winters and rots and so forth but the life is preserved if there is any life in it he said if there is any life in it it is preserved amen but if if that seed hasn't been gemnatized it will never raise again you don't have that seed that life in it it will never rise again it can't race there is nothing in it to raise it that is why before you get translated in this body there must be that life already in you amen there must be a first translation in you before a produced the the natural one amen amen amen and if we just become a nominal Christian he said there is two churches in the world Church natural Church spiritual they are all called Christians when you walk out on the streets you see a lot of people Everyone is a Christian regardless of how they act as long as they go to church they are called Christians the prophet is saying there is two churches in the World Church natural Church spiritual they are all called Christians but the church natural cannot raise the church natural cannot race because translation has not taken place inside [Music] so each do it's doing it's raising now in the word council of churches the church natural is translating itself or is resurrecting itself in the world Council of churches it's about a Christian Rises to meet Christ because it's a bride to go to meet him there is a difference in them nature hold these secrets to us and we can see them as we watch them and we see the Christ we see that Christianity speaks the truth of death burial and Resurrection amen amen Lord help me I need to read the scripture Genesis 45. I'm going to close very short ly amen foreign Genesis 45 verses 7 to 13. amen this is Joseph talking to his brothers may we know the story about Joseph amen go to a time when he now um unveiled himself to his brothers amen as the prophet said this is a type of Christ being revealed to his brothers amen we we just want to take a little um little insight from this scripture amen he said and God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth and to save your lives for a great Deliverance so now it was not you that sent me either but God and he have made me a father to pharaoh now when I was looking at this a father amen everybody sometimes you read scripture and when the Lord had opened your eyes throughout the preaching of the word you look at scripture different said the father who is the fact the father to Pharaoh I would say Joseph was the father of pharaoh you ask yourself this question did Joseph give birth to pharaoh so what does the father mean amen I'm equal with pharaoh amen so now it was not you that sent me either but God and and he had made me a father to pharaoh and Lord of all his house and a ruler threw out all the land of Egypt amen he said hey see and go up to my father and say unto him that said that son Joseph God had made me Lord of all Egypt come down unto me tearing out and thou shall dwell in the land of Goshen and thou shall be near unto me thou and thy children and their children's children and thy flocks and thy hurts and all that thou Hast and there will I nourish thee for yet there are five years of farming less doubt and thy household and all that thou Hast come to poverty and behold your I see and the eyes of my brother Benjamin that it is my mouth that's speaking unto you and he shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt and all that ye have seen and he shall haste and bring down my father heater amen the Lord is putting out us in a place called Goshen so that we are near to him amen a preserved people in a place that he is close to us we are close to him he has a purpose for our lives amen now I just want to um say something some few words about what preservation is he said the main intention of preservation is keeping in its original state amen when you're preserving something it's because you want to keep it in its original state so when God is preserving Us in this day he is keeping us in that original state that we were before the foundation of the world that is why you must look like who you were before the foundation of the world amen he sends his word to clean us up amen so that we look like who we were before the foundation of the world amen amen it is kept in a secured environment with the covering [Music] amen a secured environment with a covering amen if you want to preserve something you don't want other external forces to come to it you are trying to stop those other um external factors from coming to to to get the thing rotten amen so you preserve it in a secured environment and you get it covered amen now when when that is done and the time comes for it to be used then you take off the covering amen you take off the covering but then what is inside the tin on the can it's original amen and we must be in that original state where we are meeting him in the air amen the Holy Ghost is our preservative amen amen the Holy Ghost is our preservative Ephesians 4 30. amen the Holy Ghost is given to us to preserve us and seal us in amen until the day of your Redemption amen and amen amen amen and you see that that process of preserve preservation is intended to kill all external influence that cause damage [Music] the intention of preservation is to kill all those external forces that will come and cause damage to you that is what the Lord has sent us his message to preserve us from all those Creeds and those doctrines that the world that the church nominal is creating to come across damage to his children amen amen amen that bomb of Gilead amen amen and you see preservation is normally done for a future usage [Music] amen amen preservation is normally done for a future usage amen so when the Lord is preserving us he has an intention he has a purpose in our lives that is why he's preserving us for you to be a glorious Church a church without spot a wrinkle amen and amen amen amen and amen amen amen amen amen amen I I think our time is fast been I just I'll just close very surely man Lord help me amen this is the message amen I said they're called out Noah went into the ark for safety lot came out of Sodom one came out the other went in what is it the type of when it's conglomerated together it's the type of the church coming out of the world for safety and going into the Ark of Christ to go to Glory we are getting into that preservation of Christ to go into Glory amen it's a word come out the other went in one come out to keep from being destroyed with the world so you came out of the world and then you are going into the ark amen amen when I come out to keep from being destroyed with the world the other one went into the act of safety and Christ is the Ark of Safety and remember before that the Judgment of Hell Fire and darkness swept over Egypt Israel made her way to Goshen where there was light Israel made their way to Goshen where there was light the light of the Lord amen has been sent to us in Goshen amen amen and Egypt was left to wander in the Darkness men and women listen to me now before you are left on this Earth of misery and Conquer here in sin run to the light as hard as you can go Delights Christ Jesus and accept his message of Mercy Brahm said hurry said the angel an Escape Theater for I can't do nothing to thou has come out judgments cannot come Russia's got the missile that put all of us on our knees and so our scientists says that we are five years behind them it will be five years before we can catch up to where they are now are a little Sputnik frizzled about three foot off the ground that's made make trip after trip around the world what is this speaking to us God said to his church come hither for I can do nothing till thou has come hither God waiting for his church to break down their denominational barriers and come together for a real outpouring of the Holy Spirit to lift her to Glory I can do nothing until thou comes either waiting for us to come together amen as I said I'm closing amen letting off pressure he said oh Lord I'm praying oh Lord May that great Rock ever lay at this altar where the little wayward eaglets are run over the city can come in and be introduced to a place to beat the crust of the world from them amen amen that they can enjoy this Fellowship by letting of the pressure in this day of atomic age when the world is scared when the world is kept a whole lot of depression going on each nation is shaking the skies are trembling all nature is crying out the world itself is trembling because it could be brought to Beats but we have a kingdom that cannot be moved we have a City of Refuge we have a gaussian where the sun will never go down granted Lord let us come to this rock now amen now this is my last quote and then I'll be done amen this from the token he said I'm talking about the apply token the token agrees with every word and we know is the talking of the holy spirit amen see it's got it it's got to amen because it is the word it's the life that was in the word my words are spiritual their life said Jesus see my words are spiritual I was I was I was talking to my wife um some few days back I was telling her that the difference between Rewritten the Bible and those in denomination reading the Bible is that they have their own interpretation and the kind of interpretation you have of the Bible shows in your actions those kind of interpretation developed the spirit that leads you so when you watch them behave the way they do it's a kind of interpretation that they had that is making them act the way they act that is not the Holy Ghost amen the spirit of the Lord must line up with every word when you're acting in a certain way it must line up with everywhere then you know that your interpretation of the word is the correct one so when Moses begin his ministry in Israel with great sights you see Israel quickly guarded from all over Egypt to Goshen coming back to the home place because they know something was fixing to happen the Lord bringing us together we know something is fixing to happen amen he said oh what a type they come from the East and West they come from the lines are far Amen to face with the King to dine as his guest how blessed these pilgrims are beholding his hallowed face a glow with love divine blessed partakers of his grace as germs it is called to shine said oh Jesus is coming soon our trials will then be all oh whatever Lord this moment should come for those who are free from sin for those who are free from sin all day will they bring you Joy or sorrow and great despair when our Lord in glory comes we'll meet him up in the air amen displaying the talking and I'll raise him up in the last days certainly we are in the days the people gathered into Goshen they were ready they were ready amen they know something was fixing to happen there was just like you take ducks when it's time to for swarming you know that's amen when it's time for swimming he said they all run right together amen when peace everything else gets ready there is some Instinct draws them we can see this thing in nature amen the Holy Spirit draws the people the Holy Spirit draws the people amen oh when they come time for the great wrath of God to fall there come two ducks male and female here come two geese male and female here come two horses male and female something another pulling them the predestinated the rest of them perished oh the rest of them perished but those who felt that to come in they know that Ark was prepared it was a token that there's coming a ring they know that there was coming away no matter what the display was and what other people thought they're not amen there was something inside of them said get into there right quick get into them because that's the only place that's going to be safe because God prepared a prophet he said they act as a sign get in there and the rain was coming and they went right in there two by two all the animals went in two by two into the ark because they had not beneath it no matter what they rest amen and all outside of that act perished all outside the token of the blood perished everyone and everyone outside the talking of the Holy Ghost will perish amen shall we give a clap of rain unto the Lord amen amen amen a preserved generation amen amen amen sorry to take the time amen but we thank the Lord for this word amen and you're going to invite our brother Stephen amen amen to take over tonight look amen amen amen amen amen God richly bless you and preserved generation amen preserve for a future use amen preserved so that the factors of the outside doesn't influence you and you remain original if you look at the way the world is going now and the way you remain it seems like the world is moving on and the people on the message are still living the same kind of message that they preach since 1953. we're still trying to live exactly the same message we have not changed the message the message is still the same amen the technology is changing the world is changing but the world remains forever amen so the word is your best preservative amen glory to God I didn't want to do this but I have to do it in Psalm 27 that the brother read the Bible say in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his water where is the Pavilion of God everybody okay the Bible continue he said in the secret place of water he's Tabernacle so the Pavilion of God is where in the Tabernacle and the Tabernacle have how many places how many places and one day Marana fell down from heaven I'm giving you time so you can catch up quickly everybody okay and God told Moses that he wanted to preserve a Mana for future generation so that every high priest that is coming on the oncoming generation can go back and taste of the original manner that manner cannot be changed you have to have the same test the same color the same culture everything must look the same so God told Moses that I must find a place where I need to preserve the manner amen was the manner preserved in the other quarter he was subject to the outside everybody okay everybody okay because the other court was opened to the outside if it rained outside it's gonna rain in the outer court if it's cold outside it's going to be called on the other code if it's no outside we will find snow in the other code so the other court was not the appropriate place to keep the manner so God move on into the holy place and in the Holy place did God put the manner there because he was still subject to man manipulation because the priest could get in the first Tabernacle in the other court and the priest could go to the second uh in the holiest place and manipulate the manner but God had a secret place and that secret place was the holiest the most holy over there was in the presence of God when God took the Manna and put it in the holiest then the manner was preserved everybody okay if you want God to preserve your marriage if you want a God to preserve your life if you want a God to preserve your children the only place of preservation is in the Holy Spirit take your family into the holiest take your children into the holiest take your business into the holiest take your life and every aspect of your life and go with them into the holiest so God can preserve your children he will preserve your husband he will preserve your health he will preserve your school he will preserve even your chair that took a chair from Brother Branham but when brother Branham went in the sixth Dimension he found the chair over there he found his dog over there whatever you want to preserve in your life bring it into the presence of God bring it into the presence of almighty God that is the best place of preservation glory to God that's why we put a token in our home so that our houses will be under the preservation amen a house of prostitution amen was under the token and everything else in Jericho fell but their house of Rahab was preserved out of the entire city the only Memorial that was left was where the token was and he didn't only preserve the house but he preserved the entire family he preserved the father he preserved the mother he preserved everybody and not only did he preserve the family and whatever was in the house of rehab if Rahab had the chair that chair was preserved if she had also a bedroom I mean a bed that bed was reserved whatever was in the house was preserved why because the token the best preservative was put in the house when you fight the devil show him the token when he seen the token it's telling the devil you cannot cross the bloodline everybody okay you cannot cross the blood amen Oh Glory to God hallelujah let me close by this also the Bible says in the secret place of his word Tabernacle he shall do water because that's where you can be preserved that's why we can never over emphasize the need of a holy ghost to a Believer if you want to be preserved in this generation against every outside forces you must be in the holiest but look at what is also in that secret place the Bible says and in the secret place of his Tabernacle shall he hide me everybody okay He Shall Set me you got your Bible he shall set me up upon a rock so in the holiest David is saying there was a rock [Music] but if you look at the furniture of the Tabernacle and you look on the holiest there was no Rock it was only the Ark of the Covenant so which rock was there everybody okay because when Israel was going in on the first Exodus there was a rock following them what happened [Applause] everybody okay do you know that scripture writing do you know that scripture somebody say no brother Robert can I get few minutes I'm just in line with what we're preaching can I get few minutes I believe it's in Galatians right let's go to Galatians he shall hide me in the rock if it's not galatian it might be quarantine brother Robert you found it First Corinthians 10. Hallelujah amen I'm almost done you there you there yes First Corinthians 10 verse 4. if you dare you can say Amen David is saying in the secret place of God he shall hide me but not only are you hidden he take you and he put you in the rock can I get few minutes because something is they are just loading okay if I leave it here they will Begin to Fall so I need to unload also quickly okay if you dare you can say Amen First Corinthians chapter 10 verse 4 indeed our drink the same water so the rock gives you a drink remember in the holiest there was already manner there that you can eat but you also need some drink so they put also something for you to drink so when you have eating and drinking you covered Paul says then we are covered amen indeed or drink the same spiritual drink for the drunk of that spiritual that follow how can a rock follow somebody have you ever seen a rock following you amen he said that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was hooked now David said in the secret place of the Tabernacle he will hide me because he want me to be preserved but not only am I preserved over there there is also a rock over there in other words in the secret place that is where Christ is everybody okay and Paul says that we need to find our position in everybody okay and David say He Shall Set me upon her so he shall set you in so your position in what happened when you are set on Christ the fourth step of roof one day Moses was about to die [Music] I'm closing my Bible everybody okay and Lucifer was waiting for Moses everybody okay because Lucifer want to take the body of Moses everybody okay God look at Moses he said Moses let you do something me and you everybody okay God opened a rock everybody okay everybody okay he told Moses he stayed step on the rock and when he stepped on the rock for some reason Moses did what Moses disappeared and Lucifer begin to look and he looked he saw Michael he said Michael where's the body of Moses Marco look at him he said the Lord rebuke him the Lord rebuke you the rock that is there not only does he give you food but he will make you enter into the fourth step of roof and you're gonna disappear [Music] everybody okay where did Moses disappear on more Transfiguration when the cloud was coming from where from where from heaven who did we see there where did he came out from he came out in the cloud from Heaven away do you know that God told him that you cannot enter the Promised Land [Music] that's what God Said God said you would never enter the promised land because you did this and this more Transfiguration was in which country in which country and what was Moses doing in the Promised Land so The Rock was able to get Moses and put him in the promised land and nobody say nothing in the secret place of his Tabernacle that's where there is a preservation that's where there is a rock once you get into the holiest it normally not give you spiritual food and spiritual drink but you under
