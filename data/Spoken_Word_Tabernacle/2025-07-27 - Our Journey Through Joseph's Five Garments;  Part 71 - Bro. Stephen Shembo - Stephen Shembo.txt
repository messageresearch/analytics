========================================
there way high and when I got to almost this little saddle the clouds getting blacker and blacker wasn't a car left just us up there as far and a cowboy on the can so it got got worse and worse so in a few [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] You don't have to worry. And don't you be afraid. Joy comes in the morning. Troubles they don't last always. For there's a friend in Jesus who will wipe your tears away. And if your heart is broken, &gt;&gt; just lift your hands and say, "Oh, I know that I can make it. I know that I can stand. No matter what may come my way, my life is in your hands. With Jesus, I can take it. With him, I know I can stand. No matter what may come my way, my life is in your hands. So when your test and trials they seem to get you down and all your friends and loved ones are nowhere to be found. Remember there's a friend in Jesus who will wipe your tears away. And if your heart is broken, &gt;&gt; just lift your hands and say, "Oh, I know that I can make it. I know that I can stand. No matter what may come my way, my life is in your hands. With Jesus I can take it. &gt;&gt; With him I know I can stand. No matter what may come my way. My life is in your hands. [Music] God's got it all in control. [Music] &gt;&gt; He's got it all in control. [Music] He put that reassur way down in my soul, Lord. &gt;&gt; God's got it all in control. Let's sing that again. [Music] God's got it all in control. [Music] &gt;&gt; God's got it all in control. &gt;&gt; He put that reassur way down in my soul, Lord. [Music] God's got it all in control. [Music] &gt;&gt; I put my life in his hand. &gt;&gt; I put my life in his hand. In every road that I walk down, I'm sure it's in his plans. &gt;&gt; So I put my life in God's hands cuz he's got it all in control. [Music] He's got it all in control. He's put that rich way down in my soul. [Music] &gt;&gt; He's got it all in control. Oh, let's go to him this morning. Lord, what a comfort, Lord. Just the thought of that, Lord God, that you've got everything in control, Lord God. And not only here, Lord God, but outside these four walls, everything is going just according to your plan, Lord God. And we thank you Lord for the privilege of living in this time Lord to see everything unfold Lord and to have this word Lord unveiled before our eyes each time we meet Lord God. So Lord God, we just want to just give you thanks, Lord, and put our lives into your hands, Lord, and be assured that we don't we don't have to worry, Lord. Even when we may be brokenhearted, Lord God, you've got it all in control. And we just want to give you all the glory and the honor and the praise for that, Lord. As difficult as it may seem sometime, Lord, and Lord, we don't understand why sometimes, Lord, but if we just trust you, Lord God, we just have to trust you. There's nothing, nobody else like you, Lord. So, who can we turn to? And Lord, who can we put that unwavering trust in besides you, Lord God? So, we're inviting you one more time, Lord God, that you come and meet us in these four walls this morning, Lord, to sit down on the pew, Lord, and to put the spirit in our hearts to worship, Lord God, and to sing the songs of Zion to you, Lord God, and just to lift your name, Lord, and just to give thanks through our singing, Lord, to everything that you do for us each and every day, Lord God, for keeping us, Lord. You keep us each day, Lord. We wake up with the breath of life, Lord, and we take it for granted sometime, Lord God. But we are grateful, Lord Jesus. We have a roof over our head, Lord. We have food in our tummies, Lord, in our refrigerators, Lord. We got gas in our cars, Lord, and even a little money in our bank bank accounts, Lord. And we don't want to take any of that for granted, Lord, and say that we have need and nothing. That's the spirit of the age, Lord. We don't we don't want to be guilty of being under that spirit. Lord, if we have these things, Lord, it's because your grace has provided for us. You've shown some of us, Lord, a lot of mercy and a lot of grace in our lives, Lord, when we weren't even worthy, Lord, to speak your name, Lord. But you've given us that spirit of life, Lord. And you've given us the spirit of truth, Lord. And you've given us this revealed word, Lord God. How could we but worship you and give you singing and give you praise and just thank you, Lord. Just give you thanks for everything, Lord. We're going to ask, Lord, that you touch our musicians one more time this morning, Lord. Our singers, Lord. What a difference, Lord, this little church makes. Lord, bless our technicians, Lord. They had a meeting yesterday, Lord, and we just want to thank you, Lord, for their diligence, Lord, to make sure everything's just right, Lord God. That's what we want, Lord. We want everything to be just right for you, Lord. You're our king, Lord. You're our savior, our redeemer, our We thank you, Lord. We just want to do everything by you right. Lord God, go touch our pastor this morning, Lord God. No doubt you were up with him late through the wee hours of the morning, Lord, preparing this message for us this morning, Lord God. And we just want to make sure that you give him strength, Lord, and bring this thing forth to your people, Lord, as you intended, Lord, without any hindrance from anything coming from any of us, Lord. Let it be gone, Lord. just in the name of Jesus just go out the door cuz only the spirit of God this morning is welcome here. We thank you father and I ask also Lord in the opening prayer Lord that you give us a little relief on this heat Lord God and send us some rain Lord God. We need it naturally as much as we need it spiritually Lord. So have your will Lord above all things in the service, in the weather, in our lives, Lord, in this church. And may you get all glory for everything that's said and done. Lord, preach your word to us this morning, Lord. That's what we came for. We want to bless you, Lord. In Jesus Christ's name, we ask these things, oh God. Amen and amen and amen. Let's give him a clap offering. Turn around and say hello to your neighbor. Amen. Amen. Praise God. [Music] [Music] Lord. I would sing in deep in sin, far from the peaceful shore, very deeply stain within, sinking to rise no more. What the master of the sea heard my despairing cry from the waters lifted me. Now say I love me. Love is in me. [Music] Nothing else. Love you. Love is in me. Love is in me. When nothing else could have left me. Now all my heart to him I give it. Ever to him I cling. In his blessed presence lives. Ever his praises sing. Love so mighty and so true merits my soul as song. faithful loving service to him. Love lives in me. Love is in me. When nothing else could love me. Love is me. Love is with me. When nothing else could help me. Souls in danger look above. Jesus completely save. He will lift you by his love out of those angry ways. He's the master of the sea. He knows his will. He our savior wants to be saved to me. Love is in me. Love is in me. When nothing else could help love lives when nothing else could help love me. Redeemed, oh love to proclaim it. Redeemed by the blood of the lamb. Redeemed through his infinite mercy. His child and forever I am redeemed. Redeemed by the blood of the lamb. Redeemed, redeemed, his child. And forever I am redeemed and so happy in Jesus. No language my rapture can tell. I know that the light of his presence with me does that continually dwell. Redeem.

Amen. &gt;&gt; We all know her, don't we? &gt;&gt; Amazing grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. I just started thinking about that statement that Jesus made on the cross. It's finished. &gt;&gt; It is finished. &gt;&gt; Our redemption was complete &gt;&gt; at that moment. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's been in our our decision since then. &gt;&gt; What we going to do with it? Amazing grace, [Music] how sweet the sound. I once was lost, but now I'm found. I was a hopeless place, [Music] &gt;&gt; an empty place [Music] if not for grace. Sing it again. Amazing grace.

I was a hopeless case, an empty space, if not for grace. There's a third verse to this. I don't know if I can sing it well, but I'm going to try. It says, "Precious Lord, please take my hand. [Music] Lead me on. Let me stand." And I was a hopeless case, [Music] an empty face if not for grace. &gt;&gt; Let's give him a clap hour. Clap him this morning. Amen. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful [Applause] mercy and grace of our dear God. Y'all can be seated for a minute. We're going to have a um a short testimony here in a minute, but I do have a couple other praise reports that I'd like to read. You know, I got up this morning, my stomach wasn't feeling very well. I was complaining all over the house, but you step up here and it's like it's gone. &gt;&gt; More of that grace. Amen. Hallelujah. Actually, we have two short testimonies this morning. So, let me read the the praise report that we have. I haven't read it yet, so I'm not sure I can. This is from Sister Bridette. She says,"I would like to give all thanks, honor, and praise to our Lord for keeping us for keeping us." Is this 31 years? Is that right? &gt;&gt; Oh, it's Is this an anniversary? &gt;&gt; Oh, wow. Amen. 31 years. Praise God. She said, "Our trials and tri and triumphs." If you've been married for any length of time, you can relate to the trials and the triumphs for our partnership with him because it is a three-way covenant. Amen. &gt;&gt; In our marriage, she said, "He is so faithful." Okay, I'm not I can't &gt;&gt; Yes, I understand that because you capitalize the he. Amen. But you've got Mr. Dailyaly and then something I am looking honey. [Applause] I'm looking forward to crossing into eternity with you. She says, "Amen." Woo. Amen. Brother, that deserves a steak for lunch right there. Texas Roadhouse. Yes. Well, you're going to be there. You can eat one, too. Pick them out of the glass today. Amen. I'm going to ask brother Dam to come up and give a short testimony and then we have brother Daniel as well that has one. And I do ask try to be brief. I've tried to cut my service a little bit so we can give the pastor his time. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we want to hear what God did for you and you and brother Daniel. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Uh God bless you all. &gt;&gt; Amen. Um, it's a short testimony. This happened actually on Wednesday after service because I had to go pick up the minister, the one that was preaching. Um, what's it called? On the way here, we were listening to investment. I had put it on. On the way back, we were listening to like praise songs. And you know how the devil usually like to fight ministers after a good sermon. And this time, he didn't want to give the minister a break. Right after we left around uh what's it called the corner when we were going home there was like a cross intersection or something. We had to ride away and I was going like 10 miles per hour to 15 miles per hour and there was a young man in a truck. He took a turn and he was going towards us and he was speeding up and the minister was yelling like Jesus Jesus Jesus and everything was happening all over like I was trying to process everything as I was as I had my foot on the break and as I was calculating I was like it was going to hit us and I didn't want to stay there with the minister after preaching it's going to take a long time so I also started praying in my heart saying Lord God please do something and that that Lord God stopped him and we didn't get hit and we missed the accident. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. There's a lot going on nowadays. We have to stay in prayer. Amen. And just keep our guard up. God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you all. I wanted to give a a short testimony to glorify our Lord God. Um, a little over a week ago, I share a situation of a rental property that the renters uh were planning evil. Um, the whole time while I was not aware of that. Um but the way everything went uh the hands of God have been protecting me throughout the entire process. Um and u last week we happened to have to go to court again. Um and they show up with so many new claims and the judge looked at everything and denied all of them. Rejected all of them. It only took about 15 minutes and he rejected all of them. He ordered that they be removed from the property within 10 days. Uh knowing everything that they've done with other people in the past. Uh and they themselves saying this is mysterious. They use that word multiple times. We here we know that it is not mysterious. It is it is our Lord God who has been uh protecting us. So I glorify the name of the Lord for everything he does. Amen. Wonderful, my brother. We are so happy. God bless you. Amen. Wonderful. Let's stand this morning &gt;&gt; and go to the Lord. I'm going to ask Brother Charles if he would lead us this morning. I don't have any prayer requests, so I know you got something on your heart. &gt;&gt; Put our hands up. Yes, ma'am. Okay, Sister Lurel says we need to remember Sister Angela is well this morning. She's in the hospital. So, let's remember her and let's remember the captain, her daddy. He's he's still there as well in Charlotte. So, listen, we just learned about that problem with brother Daniel a week ago. It was something that was not we didn't know. I bet you if I come by, if you would be willing to tell me, there's things going on in everybody's life here that you're taking just to God, just you and God. So, let's acknowledge those things this morning as our precious brother goes to the Lord and and let's hold on to him, cling to him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord told us that when the Pope was over here in America and Brother Brandon was here that that great cloud of darkness was over there. So we should be in expectation of these things right now because there's nothing but evil around us. So let's be strong in the Lord. Let's pray together because we can't do this by ourselves. Precious heavenly father, we come before you, Lord God, with needs, heavenly father, that only you can answer, Lord Jesus. And father Lord, we approach you, Lord God, with a heart of understanding, Lord God, that you answer prayer, heavenly father, because you have established us in this present truth, Lord God. You have delivered us, Lord God, the best weapon, Lord God, in prayer, Lord God, and given us a revelation, Lord God, that can shake the foundations of the enemy, heavenly father. Lord God, let us not neglect the weapon of prayer, Lord God. When the pressure comes, Lord God, when the enemy comes in like a flood, the standard, Lord God, you lift. It comes through prayer, Lord God. It comes through a consecrated life, Lord God. Lord, our prayers, Lord God, will anoint your servant to preach directly what we stand in need of, heavenly father. For it is a gift, heavenly father, that you have given unto your bride, Lord Jesus. Remember our precious sister Angela, Lord God. Remember her father, Lord Jesus Christ. Father, we know that these storms, Lord God, they come, Father, for you to grant us a special grace for you to let for you to let us know that you love us, heavenly father. Lord God, bless them in a special way, Lord Jesus Christ. Bring healing, Heavenly Father. Bring an anointing in the room, Heavenly Father, and clear the path, Heavenly Father, for you to speak to your children, Heavenly Father. Because it is a promise, Heavenly Father, that whatever comes upon us, Lord God. There's no weapon formed against us that shall prosper, Lord God. These weapons will be formed. These weapons will attack, Heavenly Father, but they shall not prosper, Heavenly Father, for the hand of the Lord is upon his anointed, Father. And those stars that were in the palm of your hand, Heavenly Father, we are represented there, Lord Jesus Christ. And we thank you for it, heavenly father. Lord God, we pray for the tithes and offerings that you use them for the furtherance of your kingdom. Heavenly Father, we pray, heavenly father, for the addition, Lord God, the building of the church, heavenly father, that you continue to put your hand of grace upon it, Lord God, and do the supernatural, Lord Jesus. Father, we pray, Lord God, for all the Levites that are working in the sanctuary, Lord God, that they can hear your voice, Lord God, where they are dedicating theelves for service of the Lord, so others can hear and others can receive your word, Lord Jesus. We pray heavenly father for the musicians and the song leaders Lord God that you anoint them with a special anointing heavenly father to continue to set the battle in the array heavenly father to slay the Goliath heavenly father for in Judah heavenly father was praise established heavenly father grant it Lord Jesus we need you in this hour Lord God and we know heavenly father that if we cry out Lord God even as a baby Lord God that your answer Lord Jesus father remember the man of God that you'll use on today Lord God bless our precious brother Lord God who labors Lord God with a diligent labor, heavenly father, to serve your children, heavenly father. Lord, use him for your glory, Lord God, for that is the mouthpiece that you have chosen, Lord God. And Lord, help us, Lord God, to unite in one spirit, heavenly father, to hear what your spirit has to say, Father. Remove all the distractions, Lord God. All the pressure, Lord God, that the enemy is bringing at the minds and the hearts of your children to bring distractions that they may not hear your word. All the movement that's going on in the church, Lord God. I bind that spirit in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that we might be reverent heavenly father and honor the king of glory Lord God the master speaking Lord God where else shall we go who else shall we hear heavenly father when they close these church doors will sigh and cry and blow why do we rush the service why do we rush the man of God forget all those things heavenly father help us Lord Jesus Christ to hear from above Lord God and if we have sinned in any way Father Lord if the tutor has brought back any report that's not pleasing in our sight Lord God maybe it's not a sin maybe we're not mature in the way we ought to, Lord God. Father, but the tutors brought back the report, Father, that we're not where we ought to be, Lord. Grant us, Father, the maturity, Lord, grant us the diligence, Lord God. Grant us the consecrated life, heavenly Father, to be patient in spirit, Lord, and to pray always, Lord God, and wait for you to answer, Lord, we pray and commit these things into thy hands, Lord God, in Jesus Christ's precious and wonderful name we pray. Amen. [Music] God bless you saints. I have a little small testimony myself. Um two Fridays ago I um got pulled over by um the police. Um my car was pulling to the left and it looked like I was swerving. So he came to the window and asked if I was um you know if I had anything to think to drink. I said no sir I don't drink. Um I was dropping a friend home to Gastonia and um you know certain things uh to do with the car wasn't in line at that moment and I started to fret but then I said why um in whom shall I fear? What do I have to be afraid of when I have the God Almighty to be there for me? And though I knew the consequences of what could happen, I said, "I'll just wait on the Lord and I'll just be honest with the cop and let him know what's going on." And before I knew it, he came back to the window and I looked up at him and um he said, "Uh, I don't believe in um holding people for no reason, so I'm just going to grant you a warning. You can go ahead and go." And at that moment, I looked at my friend and I said, "You know what we were talking about. You know, this is God, right?" and um and a few other things happened that day, but we it was a very um imperative moment to just see the hand of God um in our lives.

There is something really quick that come means what? &gt;&gt; And when it come to the weather s means what? &gt;&gt; So if heart is there what is coming next? &gt;&gt; The Bible says if you remember this in Genesis 8 uh 8:22 the Bible says while the earth with what &gt;&gt; remaining &gt;&gt; what happened? Seed time &gt;&gt; and water &gt;&gt; and harvest &gt;&gt; and water &gt;&gt; and cold &gt;&gt; and water &gt;&gt; and heat &gt;&gt; and then water &gt;&gt; and summer and water &gt;&gt; and winter &gt;&gt; and water &gt;&gt; and day &gt;&gt; and water &gt;&gt; and night &gt;&gt; shall water &gt;&gt; not cease. &gt;&gt; Let's go slowly because I have to go this way. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Number one, they say seed time and the opposite is what? &gt;&gt; Harvest. &gt;&gt; And the next is what? &gt;&gt; Cold. &gt;&gt; Cold. &gt;&gt; And what is coming up? &gt;&gt; Heat.

If I'm in harvest, what happen? &gt;&gt; Let me make it easy on you. &gt;&gt; If it's day, what is coming up? &gt;&gt; Night. &gt;&gt; And if it's night, what is coming up? &gt;&gt; Day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is it difficult? &gt;&gt; So if it's summer, what is coming up? &gt;&gt; Winter. &gt;&gt; If it's winter, what is coming up? &gt;&gt; Summer. &gt;&gt; So the So when the ant is on the summer, the ant doesn't work as in doesn't leave summer. The ant is working everything &gt;&gt; according to winter. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, the ant is a season ahead. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We all know it's night. I mean, it's day right now. And we know exactly that everything you have to do, you need to do it according to a time &gt;&gt; because sooner McDonald will close. &gt;&gt; Sooner the restaurant will close. &gt;&gt; Sooner Zach will close. &gt;&gt; Sooner Walmart will close. So you got to work according to the time. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you miss the time, &gt;&gt; night is coming. Correct. &gt;&gt; And everything you were supposed to do, you got to wait &gt;&gt; till next season. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We clear now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if we see summer, we know winter is coming. That's right. &gt;&gt; If it's cold, we know that. Don't worry, sooner. What is coming up? &gt;&gt; The heat. &gt;&gt; And if it's a period of sickness, what is coming next? &gt;&gt; Period of hell. &gt;&gt; If it's a period that you struggling financially, what is coming next? financial blessing. &gt;&gt; Don't worry about it. If it's a period that you single, what is coming next? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, if you begin to understand that you don't have to worry, &gt;&gt; do you pray for the night to happen? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; What do you do? You just mind your business. &gt;&gt; That's right. And before you know it, night will happen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Whether you pray or not, night will happen because it's a covenant of God. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Amen. &gt;&gt; God is behind it. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; You are not the one controlling nature. God is in nature. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says we are on ver I'm still reading the Bible, the the scripture. &gt;&gt; We are on verse eight. The ant does what? It provideth what? her meat in the summer. &gt;&gt; Her meat when &gt;&gt; in the summer &gt;&gt; in the summer. Come on. And gather her what? &gt;&gt; Her food &gt;&gt; when &gt;&gt; in the harvest. &gt;&gt; You seen summer and harvest there. &gt;&gt; So when it's summer for the for the end, it means what? &gt;&gt; Preparation. &gt;&gt; And then when it's harvest, &gt;&gt; what does he mean? &gt;&gt; See what does the ant do? &gt;&gt; Gathering. gatherth what &gt;&gt; her food. &gt;&gt; So the gathering are happening &gt;&gt; in the summer and in the harvest. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham say the Bible is a eastern book &gt;&gt; and we are western people. And brother Brandham said the biggest trouble we got, one of the trouble we got, we are trying to understand an eastern book &gt;&gt; with a western perspective. &gt;&gt; That's why we don't understand certain things in the Bible. &gt;&gt; When you say this is summer, this is harvest. What does harvest mean? &gt;&gt; Got the food. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Let's understand. Let's take what happened in Israel. Let's put it to the western &gt;&gt; terminology so we understand what we reading. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because according to you when we say summer, the next thing we should have say is winter. &gt;&gt; But God doesn't put winter. &gt;&gt; God is saying summer and harvest. &gt;&gt; So is harvest on winter or where is harvest to us? &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So let's understand this. Let's refocus our our binocular here so we understand this. I'm trying to help you my friend. The Bible says in Matthew 24:32, Jesus say, "Now do what? &gt;&gt; Learn a parable." &gt;&gt; The parable of what? &gt;&gt; The fig tree. &gt;&gt; Remember the name is a fig tree. I came this morning and the scripture of brother Brandham was playing about the fig tree. I said, "My God, what a confirmation. &gt;&gt; The fig tree." And somebody gave my wife today a fig. &gt;&gt; I say double confirmation. &gt;&gt; So you didn't know that what was in the scripture. &gt;&gt; To you it's somebody giving my wife to me means something. &gt;&gt; It mean I'm in the right path. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible say now learn the parable of what? &gt;&gt; The fig tree. &gt;&gt; In other words, the fig tree got a message. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When its branch is yet what? &gt;&gt; Tender. and does what? &gt;&gt; Puteth forth leaves. &gt;&gt; You know that summer is water. &gt;&gt; The Bible didn't say that summer have come. &gt;&gt; In other words, we are only approaching water. &gt;&gt; We clear? I'm trying to refocus everything. &gt;&gt; According to our western world, &gt;&gt; you have winter and then what follow? &gt;&gt; Spring. &gt;&gt; Spring. &gt;&gt; And then what follow? &gt;&gt; Summer. &gt;&gt; Summer. And then what follow? &gt;&gt; Fall. &gt;&gt; Are we together now? &gt;&gt; Now summer, we already know what summer is. &gt;&gt; There is no problem for us. We're trying to find what harvest mean. &gt;&gt; Is harvest winter, spring, fall or what? What? What is going on? &gt;&gt; That's what we're trying to refocus. &gt;&gt; Now the Bible is saying here that when the branches of the fig tree do what? &gt;&gt; Bring forth. In other words, when the branch begin to come out &gt;&gt; and then when he put forth what? &gt;&gt; Leaves. &gt;&gt; In other word, God is saying that this fig tree &gt;&gt; just went through a season where there was no more leaf. &gt;&gt; Ah, please help me. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm I'm in a surgery to help you. There is no more leaf &gt;&gt; and there is no more branches. to us the season that you see no leaves &gt;&gt; on the trees &gt;&gt; and no branches, it is which season? &gt;&gt; Are we clear now? &gt;&gt; Are we Are we clear now? &gt;&gt; So now we understand winter according to the Bible. &gt;&gt; Correct. Amen. &gt;&gt; We clear now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is no leaf. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No branches. Everything is dry. Amen. Now Jesus is saying learn the parable of the fig tree. When you see branches begin to come &gt;&gt; and then leaf begin to come up on the trees. According to us here in the United States in winter, there is nothing on the trees. But there is a season that leaf begin to come &gt;&gt; and allergy begin to pop up &gt;&gt; and things begin to bad. &gt;&gt; What do we call it here? &gt;&gt; Spring. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So what was Jesus talking about? &gt;&gt; Spring. &gt;&gt; To us Jesus is talking about what? spring &gt;&gt; and spring is before what? &gt;&gt; Summer. &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus say when you see spring &gt;&gt; just know that what &gt;&gt; summer is now. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Have I lost somebody? &gt;&gt; In other words, Jesus when he's seeing spring, what is he looking at? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you talking about spring, &gt;&gt; Jesus doesn't is not really careful about spring. Jesus begin to look at &gt;&gt; summer. &gt;&gt; And when Jesus is in summer, what is Jesus looking at? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, are we together? &gt;&gt; Now, are we together? &gt;&gt; The true word for fall is called autumn. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then on the summer, this is when the first harvest start. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. Follow me my friend. &gt;&gt; And it's usually the harvest of fruit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why when you read your Bible, you will see the Bible says summer fruit, summer fruit all over the scripture. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. The first harvest of the first fruit started in the summer. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You will understand why Jesus went. Okay, let me leave it alone. Okay. Okay. Okay. When the summer start, this is where the first harvest is starting. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Then the true harvest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where it's about the crop and everything else. That one happened in the fall. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; This is where your harvest is. &gt;&gt; We understand now. Now, let's go back to our scripture. So the ant &gt;&gt; work in summer and in the &gt;&gt; harvest. &gt;&gt; Which is which month? Which season? &gt;&gt; Fall. &gt;&gt; What? Fall or fall? &gt;&gt; Winter. &gt;&gt; So summer and fall is a preparation for what? &gt;&gt; Winter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together?

There is no supervisor. &gt;&gt; There is no ruler. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is no parent. &gt;&gt; There is no mentor. &gt;&gt; But these creature are depending on the season. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And they usually work by looking at the season ahead of them. &gt;&gt; My subject this morning is taking advantage of what? &gt;&gt; The season. So if you are looking for winter, what do you do on the fall and the spring? &gt;&gt; Prepare. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says this, my friend.

And the summer is what? &gt;&gt; It's ended. &gt;&gt; And we are not water. save. &gt;&gt; Why is the Bible keeping put I mean put summer and harvest. Summer and harvest. And the Bible is saying here that summer have gone. &gt;&gt; The harvest has gone &gt;&gt; and we are not what? &gt;&gt; The correct translation means we are not delivered. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Because Israel was depending &gt;&gt; on the summer &gt;&gt; and the harvest to to gather &gt;&gt; the food provided by God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you tell a Jews it's summer, it means something else. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; When you tell us it's summer, we go to the beach. &gt;&gt; I hope you are understanding me. Young people, &gt;&gt; summer doesn't mean beach &gt;&gt; because if you miss the summer, &gt;&gt; if you miss the time, &gt;&gt; you going to stop down the road. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Help me preach my friend. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; These are tough message believer.

The rapture have not happened yet. &gt;&gt; You need to know how to live. &gt;&gt; And God has a program &gt;&gt; that is orchestrating everything in this world. &gt;&gt; And if you learn the program of God, you won't have an accident. &gt;&gt; You will be riding on after the program. &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together.

He already placed. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; All you have to do, jump on it. &gt;&gt; And when you jump on a roller coaster, you just sit quiet. It will take you where it's supposed to go. &gt;&gt; That's what God is telling you. Learn from the ant. &gt;&gt; The ant learn about the program. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The ant just got on the elevator and sat quiet. And the elevator is picking them up. &gt;&gt; That's right. We human being are going through the stairs. &gt;&gt; There are stairs and there is an elevator. &gt;&gt; Elevator. You don't do no work. &gt;&gt; Somebody else is doing the work. &gt;&gt; In the stairs, you will be doing work. &gt;&gt; By the time you get to the fourth level, you tired. &gt;&gt; But the one in the elevator can't be even drinking coffee. And the elevator is taking me up.

Jump to verse 9, my friend. I'm reading the Bible. &gt;&gt; Let's go. How long will you what? &gt;&gt; Sleep. &gt;&gt; The devil is troubling you not to get this. So let's stay focused. &gt;&gt; How long will you sleep? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh lazy slagger. &gt;&gt; When will you rise up out of your sleep? &gt;&gt; In other words, God is telling somebody, "Wake up." &gt;&gt; You've been playing too much. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You lost a ladder season in your life. I'm going to get in your life and I'm going to show you how your life is revolving. &gt;&gt; Amen. And God say wake up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch the ant. &gt;&gt; There is a secret in nature. There is a secret in the ant. &gt;&gt; Learn that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse uh 10. Yet a what? &gt;&gt; A little sleep. &gt;&gt; And a what? &gt;&gt; A little slumber. &gt;&gt; Did you see God saying a big sleep? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Did you see God saying a big sleep? &gt;&gt; God say a what? &gt;&gt; A little sleep. &gt;&gt; And a little what? &gt;&gt; Slumber. So what causes your trouble is not too big. &gt;&gt; A little le &gt;&gt; up the whole lamp. &gt;&gt; A little tiny habit &gt;&gt; can destroy your entire life. &gt;&gt; Not the big habit, not the little bit of habit. &gt;&gt; And the Bible say just a little sleep &gt;&gt; and a little what? &gt;&gt; Slumber. In other words, God is telling you the little bit the stuff that you think there. &gt;&gt; Correct? &gt;&gt; Because when the disciple came to God, they say increase our faith, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And they were expecting God to say, "Okay, I'm going to give you a big faith." God said, "No, if you have a faith like a what? &gt;&gt; Master seed. &gt;&gt; A little mustard seed. If you can speak to that mountain, &gt;&gt; it's usually the little stuff &gt;&gt; that can bring the big stuff down. It's usually the little ant &gt;&gt; that can give you wisdom. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible say a little sleep come and a what? &gt;&gt; A little slumber. &gt;&gt; Come on. And a what? &gt;&gt; A little folding of the hands. &gt;&gt; A little what? &gt;&gt; Folding of the hands. &gt;&gt; Not a ladder. Folding of hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A little what? &gt;&gt; Folding of the hands. &gt;&gt; A little doing nothing. is &gt;&gt; a lud taking off a break &gt;&gt; can cause you trouble in life. &gt;&gt; No, I'm just taking it easy now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They usually tell &gt;&gt; I don't have a scripture for it in my language. Don't give the dog raw meat. Especially when you have h a farmer. &gt;&gt; Right. Correct, brother. That's right. &gt;&gt; Always give the dog cook meat. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; Because the dog will learn to eat cook meat. &gt;&gt; But if you give the dog raw meat, &gt;&gt; the dog begin to taste the blood. &gt;&gt; Now the dog begin to look at all the goat. all the pigs that are in the farm &gt;&gt; as a as a prey to eat &gt;&gt; because the goat now now the dog doesn't wait doesn't have to wait for cook food. &gt;&gt; The dog understand that hey if I can attack the goat right there so the dog is no longer a protector of the goat. He became a destroyer of the goat. So a little sleep, &gt;&gt; a little testing of something can open up a wide door and you won't know how to come out of it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; A little habit, &gt;&gt; a little folding of hand, a little procrastination. &gt;&gt; Today you procrastinate, tomorrow you procrastinate.

Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Proverb 30:4. If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We must be delivered from these things. &gt;&gt; Proverb 20 uh 30:4. The Bible say there be how many things? &gt;&gt; Four things &gt;&gt; which are how? &gt;&gt; Little upon the earth. &gt;&gt; So God is telling you those things among the earth, they are how many? &gt;&gt; What the size of it? &gt;&gt; Little. &gt;&gt; They are very little. In other words, you will you will you will underestimate those things. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; Because of their size. &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham told us it's not the size &gt;&gt; that's correct &gt;&gt; of the dog in the fight. &gt;&gt; It is the size of the fight inside the dog. &gt;&gt; But the Bible say there are four things which are little upon the earth. Come on. But they are what? &gt;&gt; Exceeding wise. &gt;&gt; They are not wise. &gt;&gt; They are very wise. Amen. &gt;&gt; But those things are how &gt;&gt; we need to know one of them. That's what I'm interested for today. &gt;&gt; Verse 25. The ants. &gt;&gt; Ah. So the ant are not wise. &gt;&gt; They are exceedingly wise. &gt;&gt; The ants are a people what? Not strong. I need to work four job. &gt;&gt; It's not this. &gt;&gt; You can wear out yourself. &gt;&gt; The ant don't have this. &gt;&gt; But they are exceedingly. In other words, the ant are operating by wisdom. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; They make wisdom worksh &gt;&gt; more than the muscle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. There are four things that are exceedingly wise. The ant are a people what? &gt;&gt; Not strong. &gt;&gt; Come on. Yet they do what? &gt;&gt; Prepare their meat in the summer when &gt;&gt; in the summer. &gt;&gt; So this preparation of a meat in the summer, God is utilizing this to give the ant more wisdom. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the ant understand &gt;&gt; foresee the season. Amen. &gt;&gt; The ant have a discernment &gt;&gt; sir &gt;&gt; of the season &gt;&gt; and what to do in the season &gt;&gt; and based on that discernment they are reflecting wisdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why all of this? &gt;&gt; John chapter 5 and we take off. &gt;&gt; Let's go to John chapter 5. &gt;&gt; Oh my God. He's just reading the Bible. [Laughter] If you there you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; John 5 verse2 we're talking about taking advantage. &gt;&gt; So all of you here already understood the ant. &gt;&gt; Brother say even in the kingdom of the ant. If you don't work you don't eat. I have the code. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's what brother say. &gt;&gt; So the ant are discipline. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you were playing on the internet no problem. I won't loan you money. &gt;&gt; Don't say amen. Let's go to John chapter 5, my friend. &gt;&gt; If you there, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse two. Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a water &gt;&gt; a pool. &gt;&gt; Remember this is not a river. &gt;&gt; This is not a river. &gt;&gt; A river flows. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is not an ocean. This is a pool. A pool. The water in a pool stay &gt;&gt; stagnant. Calm. &gt;&gt; The scripture knows why he says a pool. &gt;&gt; Because if it's a river, there is something else. &gt;&gt; Because the river have current. &gt;&gt; It goes one way. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. The Bible says there was a pool kama which is called in the Hebrew tongue water &gt;&gt; Bethesda. &gt;&gt; Having how many porches? &gt;&gt; Five porches. Praise God. Grace. Verse three. Let's leave those uh stuff. Let's get to what we trying to get. Indeed lay a great multitude. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say thousands. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Of what? &gt;&gt; Impulence folk &gt;&gt; and what &gt;&gt; of blind &gt;&gt; and who? &gt;&gt; Of halt. &gt;&gt; And who? &gt;&gt; Withered. &gt;&gt; And who? &gt;&gt; Waiting for the movement of the water. &gt;&gt; So everybody that was there got problem. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you are laying in the porches of Bethesda, &gt;&gt; you got a problem. &gt;&gt; To make it plain, you got a sickness. &gt;&gt; You got a illness in your body. &gt;&gt; That's why you are there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's put it there maybe in another way. There was a hospital called Beesta. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he had five campuses. the man uh CMC and the Huntersville and the one and five of them and in them lay a lot of people &gt;&gt; that are sick. &gt;&gt; All of them were waiting. They were waiting for what? &gt;&gt; The moving of the water &gt;&gt; and the moving of the water. So the water was moving. We know that the water of the pool doesn't move. Yes, &gt;&gt; but something was happening to this pool &gt;&gt; that the water was moving &gt;&gt; and brother Brandham say normally I have the code if it's a river are we together &gt;&gt; water run into a certain direction and the wind sometime will come in the opposite direction and brother Brandham say when the current and the wind are opposite it create what they call a trouble water &gt;&gt; but this is not a river. &gt;&gt; So when we got trouble water in a pool, they knew that there must be something &gt;&gt; that is troubling the water. &gt;&gt; In other words, this is not a natural occurrence. &gt;&gt; This is something supernaturally that is chopping the water up. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse four. For what? An angel &gt;&gt; went down when &gt;&gt; at a certain season. &gt;&gt; Any question? &gt;&gt; The angel come when? &gt;&gt; At a certain season. &gt;&gt; So the angel doesn't come any time. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The angel come at a certain &gt;&gt; season. &gt;&gt; At a certain season into what? &gt;&gt; The pool. &gt;&gt; And do what? &gt;&gt; And troubled the water. &gt;&gt; Chop the water. He stir the water. &gt;&gt; Amen. What? Whosoever then what? First, &gt;&gt; after the troubling of the world, the do what? &gt;&gt; Stepped in, &gt;&gt; was made how &gt;&gt; whole &gt;&gt; of what? &gt;&gt; Whatsoever disease he had. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this angel was bringing healing. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; The angel will come and hit the water. &gt;&gt; And when the water is trouble, &gt;&gt; the water now receive virtue &gt;&gt; of a healing. But we know that, oh Israel, I am the Lord &gt;&gt; that heals you &gt;&gt; from all your disease. &gt;&gt; So this angel must be not just an angel. &gt;&gt; But it must be who? &gt;&gt; The angel of the Lord. &gt;&gt; When he hit me, I say, "Wait a minute. Let me verify with brother Brandham." When I verify, I found only one coat. Brother Brandham say it was the angel of the Lord. I say praise the Lord. Now my inspiration is lining up with the messenger. Now I can tell you that. &gt;&gt; So it was the angel of the Lord. God himself was coming down and trouble the water. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The problem was who would jump first. &gt;&gt; What an expectation. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said they were even fighting with knives. because he only come in the season. &gt;&gt; So if you are distracted &gt;&gt; if you are constantly going to Walmart &gt;&gt; when the angel come, you won't be there. &gt;&gt; So you must be constantly watching. &gt;&gt; Are we together &gt;&gt; for the moving of the water? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because your deliverance is there. Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; What type of deliverance? The Bible says in verse four, for the troubling, the Bible say, for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and trouble the water, whosoever then first after the troubling of the water. Brother Brandham say by faith stepping was made what? &gt;&gt; Of what? &gt;&gt; Whatsoever disease he had. In other word, the w the disease was not the problem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The the water didn't make a distinction &gt;&gt; on your problem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If it's high blood pressure, &gt;&gt; if it's diabetes, &gt;&gt; if it's kidney, if it's skin problem, if it's a headache, if it's a female trouble, that doesn't count there. Amen. &gt;&gt; The water will touch whichever disease. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am the Lord your God who heals you from water. &gt;&gt; So the disease is not the problem. The problem was the opportunity. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; The season &gt;&gt; was more important. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; In other words, the the the Bible say the angel come in a certain what? &gt;&gt; So the angel bring the season. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I hope you did it. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham say we didn't we don't know whether it would take weeks or months or years we don't know but the season lays with the angel. So when the angel come down, &gt;&gt; the season has come. &gt;&gt; And when the season was was come, &gt;&gt; whatsoever your problem is sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You need to seize the season. You need to jump in the season. &gt;&gt; You need to step in the season. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; you need to step in the anointing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Do you know that water represent a multitude of the people? &gt;&gt; You know that, right? &gt;&gt; You know that, right? &gt;&gt; So, when you see the multitude of the people begin to get stirred, &gt;&gt; who have come down? When you are in church and then you see people rising up and say, "Praise the Lord." Oh, glory to God. Oh, hallelujah. Who has come down? [Applause] &gt;&gt; I hope we together. &gt;&gt; I hope we together. Instead of watching your neighbor like this, instead of folding hand, instead of sitting like this, &gt;&gt; you need to jump in the water. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you getting me. You who sleep in the church, &gt;&gt; wake up. Sleep &gt;&gt; deliver your people Jesus. &gt;&gt; You who sleep in church, &gt;&gt; every church you slumber like this. That's why the angel passes. &gt;&gt; You who sit in the church like you lost, your mind is on the TV. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Your mind is not in church. &gt;&gt; The angel is coming and troubling the people. Yes, sir. and chopping the water. Wake up. Shake your hand. Jump fast. [Applause] &gt;&gt; In other word, when you coming in this church, &gt;&gt; always enter with expectation. [Applause] I don't know if you're getting me. &gt;&gt; Why are other people giving testimony and you don't? [Music] &gt;&gt; And you think it's normal. It's not normal. &gt;&gt; When you enter to church, sit down and begin to watch the moving of the water. &gt;&gt; When sister Lin is singing, watch the moving of the water. When sister Yed is singing, watch the moving of the water. When Zad is singing, watch the moving of the water. When Tony is, &gt;&gt; watch the moving of the water. When you see the water begin to get sharp, raise your hand. Say, "Father, I am come." [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's not the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know sister Laura, &gt;&gt; you know sister divine. &gt;&gt; Did you ever seen her behaving and crying and going backward? &gt;&gt; You need to wake up and say that is not sister divine. That is the Holy Spirit that have struck her. Pass me don't that pass me no gentle savior. If you touch her, I'm here too. I won't go home like that. I need to be touched. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; Because the chopping of the water &gt;&gt; is a signal that I'm here. &gt;&gt; God uses your brother to let you know that I'm here. So when you see your brother, you say, "Okay, so God is here. If God is here, take my request, take my blood pressure, take my diabetes, take my give me trouble, I'm going to go home free. I'm going to rise and take my bed and go home." &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. In other words, I'm leaving the church with a testimony. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together, my friend? &gt;&gt; I know some of you will say it's your character &gt;&gt; or my character is quiet. &gt;&gt; Come in my office. Let me nail a needle on you. &gt;&gt; Come to my office. Let me poke you with a needle. &gt;&gt; I will see how quiet you are. You are lying. &gt;&gt; You need to know the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is a living being. It is life. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; When you were in the world, why were you screaming? &gt;&gt; Why were you screaming? Yoohoo. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And the church make you quiet. Brother Brandham say where God is there noises. Yes sir. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; It is not empty nose. It is the chopping of the angel. When the word is coming forth, it create the stimulation of the revelation and the angel come down. &gt;&gt; God doesn't send his word for nothing. And his word won't return back to him for nothing. He must accomplish. Father, let there be me today. That your word will deliver me when I leave this church. No more financial trouble, no more bad habit, no more headache, no more trouble, no more problem. I'm living free. [Applause] Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; I have 8 minutes. I have not finished reading the Bible.

Brother Robert say, "Brother Stephen, that's a good idea." &gt;&gt; It was not me. &gt;&gt; I called the architect. &gt;&gt; The architect say, "Yes, you can go three feet." Why only three? [Applause] [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Why only three? In other word, the obstacle was trying to slow us down, but because it's the season, the building is moving, &gt;&gt; the work won't stop. &gt;&gt; The work won't stop. &gt;&gt; Are we together?

When Jesus do what? &gt;&gt; Saw him lie. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. Because brother Brandham said they asked Jesus a question. How did you do that? He said, I do nothing &gt;&gt; except what? My father showed me. &gt;&gt; So the father gave Jesus Christ the ID. &gt;&gt; He say when you go to spoken word, &gt;&gt; look at somebody that look the face like this. &gt;&gt; So when Jesus is coming, he's looking for your face. &gt;&gt; That's him. &gt;&gt; That's her. &gt;&gt; That's her. &gt;&gt; That's her. &gt;&gt; Look, the Bible say when Jesus saw him what? live &gt;&gt; and knew he saw him. How &gt;&gt; lie. &gt;&gt; Waiting for the angel. &gt;&gt; 38. &gt;&gt; If he goes to the to McDonald, he's going this way. &gt;&gt; You take $5. Go get me McDonald. Bring it to me. &gt;&gt; He bring McDonald. He said there &gt;&gt; waiting. Hallelujah. And when Jesus saw him how &gt;&gt; lie &gt;&gt; and knew God knows &gt;&gt; knew what &gt;&gt; that he had been now a long time in that case. &gt;&gt; God knows how long your case has been. &gt;&gt; Your problem God knows. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. The trouble you sitting in the church waiting for, God knows how long it's been. &gt;&gt; Maybe your neighbor don't know. &gt;&gt; Maybe the people that are sitting with you don't know. &gt;&gt; But there is more that knows. &gt;&gt; And what matter is for him to know. &gt;&gt; Because he's the one that give the healing. &gt;&gt; The Bible say when Jesus see saw him lie and knew that he had been for what &gt;&gt; a long time. In that case &gt;&gt; he says to him &gt;&gt; what &gt;&gt; wilt thou be made whole? &gt;&gt; What question &gt;&gt; which our society will call a dumb question &gt;&gt; to begin with? To begin with what is he doing in the in in the pool of Bethesda? &gt;&gt; Because those that sat there are how lame blind widow and trouble. So how do you want and ask somebody who's sitting in the hospital? You say do you want to get here? Why is he in the hospital to begin with? &gt;&gt; He came to the hospital to do what? &gt;&gt; To get here. But Jesus come and ask him. Say, do you want to get here? &gt;&gt; Do you really mean what you're asking for? &gt;&gt; Do you really mean it? &gt;&gt; Do you really want it? &gt;&gt; Because you can talk all you want, but do you want it? [Music] Oh Lord, heal me. Do you want the healing? &gt;&gt; Of you do, this is what Jesus said. Will you be made whole? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The important man answered him and say what &gt;&gt; sir? &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; I have no man. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; When the water is troubled, &gt;&gt; put me into the pool. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; But while I am coming, &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; another stepth down before me. &gt;&gt; Question. Was that the answer? &gt;&gt; No. [Laughter] Did I ask you uh what is your difficulty to get to the water? &gt;&gt; I ask you do you want to get here? Look human being [Music] &gt;&gt; in other words the season have come the opportunity has come &gt;&gt; and say do you want to get it and then you go you know uh let me explain you you know what I'm saying &gt;&gt; when every time I want to go to the water &gt;&gt; you see the parameter here there is two feet and five second here when I try to go did I ask you all of that &gt;&gt; do you want to get here but the god which in mercy [Applause] [Laughter] The God rich in mercy didn't even listen to the explanation. In other words, he's blinded to the season. I am the season. &gt;&gt; I am the one you're looking for. I am the angel. &gt;&gt; I come for you [Applause] &gt;&gt; based on the answer. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm landing the ship. They said based on the answer, Jesus could have dodged him. &gt;&gt; Jesus could have said, "You know what? You didn't answer my question. Let me move on." But because &gt;&gt; the command &gt;&gt; was already given for that man &gt;&gt; even Jesus cannot change &gt;&gt; because the day was your day. The day was the day of the young man. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And let me finish by this my friend. And Jesus said to him, "What? &gt;&gt; Rise. &gt;&gt; Do what? take up thy bed &gt;&gt; and what? &gt;&gt; And walk. &gt;&gt; What a command. &gt;&gt; In other words, don't go. Maybe he was expecting Jesus to say, "Go jump in the water." &gt;&gt; Jesus say, "Rise." &gt;&gt; If you really mean it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; If you really mean it. &gt;&gt; If you really mean it. &gt;&gt; Okay. Show me your faith. Rise. &gt;&gt; Take up your bed &gt;&gt; and go. What happened to the man? Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse nine. And what? &gt;&gt; And immediately &gt;&gt; what happened? &gt;&gt; The man was made whole. &gt;&gt; And what? &gt;&gt; And took up his bed. &gt;&gt; And what? &gt;&gt; And walked. &gt;&gt; On the same day, he was what? &gt;&gt; The Sabbath. &gt;&gt; Who was carrying the man first? The bed. But now what happened to the man? &gt;&gt; Who's carrying who? &gt;&gt; The man carrying the bed. &gt;&gt; Who's carrying who? &gt;&gt; The man carrying the bed. &gt;&gt; What does he tell you about it, my friend? &gt;&gt; What was carrying you, you begin to carry it. &gt;&gt; Spoken word. Does he tell you something? &gt;&gt; Because in this message, we were told of the third vision. &gt;&gt; All right, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the third vision, when you come in, &gt;&gt; the wheelchair carry you. &gt;&gt; But when you going out, &gt;&gt; you are pushing the wheelchair. &gt;&gt; Listen my friend, today is your day. You might have missed many season &gt;&gt; but the God of the season is here. &gt;&gt; I don't know what's going on in your life. God is manful that you suffer for so long. And if you believe it, rise up and thank him for it. [Applause] Let's stand my friend &gt;&gt; because another season have opened up when God is revealed in human flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Thank you Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Never compare this church service to the last week. Last week was another season. &gt;&gt; Wednesday was another season. Today is another season. &gt;&gt; In other words, every time you going to church, God is opening a season.
