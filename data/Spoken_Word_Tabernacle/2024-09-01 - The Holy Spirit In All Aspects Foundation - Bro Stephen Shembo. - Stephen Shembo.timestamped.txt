[3:36] Spirit when you get the holy
[3:39] spirit that Holy
[3:42] Spirit is what gives you the
[3:45] right to all the promises of
[3:49] God or to the entire

[11:08] Christ and I am also human being just
[11:11] like
[11:13] them and we are very limited to our own
[11:17] ability that's why we ask
[11:20] Lord for the Holy Spirit to
[11:23] come the one who wrote the Bible through
[11:26] the
[11:27] prophets and may you be with
[11:30] Lord may you teach your children father
[11:33] may you open up the windows of

[11:51] aspects we thank you for
[11:54] everything and we thank you for brother
[11:57] Joel and his conation Lord and commit
[12:01] everything unto their
[12:03] hand in the name of Jesus
[12:05] Christ amen amen let's go to the Book of
[12:10] Luke Luke Luke chapter 16
[12:16] Luke and verse
[12:19] 16 if you dare you can say
[12:22] Amen
[12:27] s amen amen amen few
[12:31] folks Luke 16 Luke verse
[12:39] 16 the Bible
[12:42] says the
[12:44] law and the
[12:47] prophets
[12:49] were until
[12:51] John it's very
[12:54] strange when we want to talk about the
[12:56] Holy
[12:57] Spirit to begin to speak about
[13:00] prophets but it's very
[13:03] important without the prophet we won't
[13:05] understand these
[13:07] things I'm going to read it again the
[13:10] law and the prophet were until John you
[13:16] might be
[13:17] seated
[13:20] okay I will try to sit and if I need to
[13:23] stand I will
[13:25] stand if you look at this scripture in
[13:28] the book of luk
[13:32] the Bible says that the law and the
[13:35] prophets were until
[13:38] John and usually we interpret this
[13:41] scripture
[13:44] wrong because the way people perceive
[13:46] the
[13:48] scripture is that when John the Baptist
[13:52] came the law was
[13:55] abolished which is true because the
[13:58] Bible says that
[14:01] Christ was the end of the
[14:03] law so when Jesus Christ died on the
[14:07] cross Jesus spoke and say it is
[14:11] finished in other words the penalty of
[14:14] the law was already paid by
[14:17] Christ but the Bible didn't stop at the
[14:21] law
[14:22] only the Bible say the law and the
[14:27] prophet and certain people people take
[14:30] it from
[14:31] here and they say that you know the
[14:34] prophet also are
[14:37] finished if the prophet are
[14:39] finished it means after Jesus Christ we
[14:42] cannot have any more
[14:45] prophets but that is not true what stop
[14:49] is the
[14:50] law but the prophet never
[14:53] stop so before I continue with the
[14:56] scripture Let's Travel a little bit in
[14:58] the book book of act so let's see if the
[15:01] prophet stop or the prophet
[15:07] continue let's go to act chapter 11 and
[15:09] we will come back to our
[15:13] scripture act chap
[15:20] 11 verse
[15:22] 27 ver6 if you thereare you can say amen
[15:26] amen I want to hear your amen amen there
[15:30] we go looks like somebody's still
[15:34] shy they told me it's a conference so we
[15:36] need to work
[15:38] together amen amen okay act chapter 20
[15:44] uh chapter 11 verse
[15:47] 27 the Bible says and these days came
[15:55] what came
[15:57] prophets do you see that this is after
[16:01] the death of Jesus
[16:03] Christ and the Holy Spirit already came
[16:05] on the day of
[16:07] Pentecost but when the Holy Spirit came
[16:10] on the day of of Pentecost Prophet never
[16:14] ceased the Bible said that they were
[16:18] prophet in the book of act so when they
[16:21] say the law and the prophet were until
[16:25] John it doesn't mean that the prophet
[16:28] stop a John the
[16:31] Baptist because Jesus Christ himself was
[16:34] the
[16:35] prophet and Jesus Christ came after John
[16:38] the
[16:39] Baptist so the prophet never
[16:42] stops and according to the book of fact
[16:45] 11 ver
[16:48] 27 the Bible says and in these
[16:51] days came prophets if you notice it's
[16:55] Prophet
[16:57] plural it means that there were many
[17:00] prophets and the Bible say came Prophet
[17:03] from Jerusalem unto
[17:06] Antioch and there stood one of
[17:10] them Nam
[17:12] agabus so there is a prophet here with a
[17:15] name in the book of
[17:17] Act and the Bible say and signify by the
[17:23] spirit that there should be great
[17:27] D through all the
[17:30] world which came to pass in the day of
[17:33] Clodius
[17:35] Caesar let's go again in the book of act
[17:38] chapter
[17:40] 13 you need to keep your Bible because
[17:43] this is a
[17:44] conference act chap 13 Verse
[17:49] 1 if you thereare you can say
[17:52] Amen the Bible says now they were in the
[17:57] church that was at end
[17:59] certain prophets again
[18:02] plural and
[18:04] teachers as
[18:07] Barnabas and Simeon that was called
[18:12] nager and Lucius luus of serin and
[18:17] man which has been brought up with Herod
[18:20] the tetrarch and Saul amen amen amen so
[18:25] once again we can see in the book of
[18:27] fact that Prophet never
[18:31] ceased let's go again to the book of act
[18:34] chapter
[18:36] 15 act 15 verse
[18:42] 32 if you dare you can say
[18:45] Amen the Bible say and
[18:48] Judas and
[18:50] Silas being prophets prophets also
[18:56] themselves exhorted the brethren
[19:00] with many words and confirm
[19:02] them so I gave you three scriptures here
[19:06] showing that after the death the
[19:09] resurrection of Jesus Christ prophets
[19:11] still
[19:15] exist so let's go back again to the Book
[19:17] of Luke chap 16 verse
[19:22] 16 if you need more scripture you can
[19:25] see me after and I will give it to you
[19:29] Luke 16 verse 16 Luke now we can read
[19:34] together the law and the prophet were
[19:37] until
[19:40] John we understand here that the law
[19:43] seized by the office of a prophet never
[19:48] ceased are we clear together and since
[19:51] that time the kingdom of God is
[19:55] preached and every man PR into
[20:00] it so my first scripture that I use
[20:04] today is speaking about the prophet all
[20:07] the way to
[20:09] John so prophets started from the Old
[20:13] Testament and for some reason there is a
[20:16] turning point in at John the
[20:20] Baptist but the prophet never sees with
[20:23] John the
[20:24] Baptist because John the Baptist
[20:27] introduced the great prophet
[20:30] amen which was the Lord Jesus
[20:33] Christ who was the god of the
[20:37] prophet and after Jesus Christ Prophet
[20:40] also
[20:42] continues so we have the law we have
[20:46] prophets we have
[20:48] John are we together let's go to the
[20:52] Book of Luke chapter 24 Luke
[21:00] so I'm not using the board but remember
[21:03] we have the law we have the prophet
[21:05] prophet and we have Christ and after
[21:09] Christ the prophet
[21:12] continues let's go to the Book of Luke
[21:14] chapter 24 Luke Luke 24 Luke we begin at
[21:20] verse 13 so you can get the
[21:23] background they told me that I'm going
[21:25] to take an hour and a half and then give
[21:27] you a break and then we come back
[21:33] again Luke 24
[21:38] verse3 the Bible says this is about the
[21:42] disciple on the road to
[21:45] EMAs the Bible says and behold two of
[21:50] them went that same day to a village
[21:53] called
[21:55] Em which was from Jerusalem
[21:59] about three score
[22:02] furlongs and they talked together of the
[22:05] things of these things which had
[22:09] happened and it came to
[22:12] pass that while they commune
[22:15] together and
[22:17] reason Jesus himself Drew
[22:21] n and went with them so these Disciple
[22:26] This is after the death and the
[22:28] resurrection ction of Jesus
[22:31] Christ some people say that Jesus Christ
[22:33] rose from the
[22:36] dead and others say that no he didn't
[22:38] raise his disciples stole
[22:42] him and at this time Jesus didn't show
[22:45] up to his disciple
[22:49] yet and two of them were traveling
[22:51] together on the road to
[22:54] EMAs and they begin to talk about the
[22:56] event that transpired
[23:00] and as they were talking about those
[23:03] events which concern the Lord Jesus
[23:06] Christ the Bible said that Jesus himself
[23:09] joined
[23:11] them so if you want Jesus to join your
[23:16] conversation you need to talk about
[23:18] Jesus Christ when you talk at home about
[23:21] Jesus Christ when you talk to your
[23:24] friend about Jesus Christ this is one
[23:27] way to attract Jesus
[23:32] so the disciple were talking about Jesus
[23:35] Christ and Jesus Christ came and joined
[23:39] them but sadly they did not know that
[23:43] Jesus was with
[23:45] them I'm going to continue the Bible
[23:48] says but their eyes were Holden that
[23:51] they should know
[23:53] him in other words Christ was with them
[23:58] Christ was was talking to them Christ
[24:00] was walking with them Christ was
[24:03] traveling with them but they did not
[24:06] know that this was Jesus
[24:09] Christ so to cut a long story
[24:12] short Jesus begin to talk to them about
[24:17] himself and I'm going to go straight
[24:19] where he begin to talk to them
[24:22] about you if you can jop down with me to
[24:25] verse uh 25
[24:30] the Bible says then he said unto them
[24:34] this is Jesus
[24:35] Christ oh
[24:38] fools and slow of
[24:41] heart to believe all that the prophet
[24:45] have
[24:46] spoken and if you notice again it's
[24:49] about
[24:51] Prophet but the theme of this
[24:54] conference is the holy spirit in all
[24:57] aspects
[25:00] why are you talking about
[25:02] prophets stay with me and you will you
[25:05] will find out why we have to start by
[25:08] prophet and Jesus told them you
[25:13] fools slow of
[25:15] heart why you didn't believe the prophet
[25:18] in other words the prophet spoke about
[25:21] Jesus
[25:22] Christ and if you have believed the
[25:25] prophet you should have understood Jesus
[25:28] Jesus
[25:29] Christ so the best way to understand
[25:32] Jesus
[25:33] Christ you need a
[25:35] prophet are we together do you follow me
[25:40] praise be to the name of the Lord if we
[25:43] know it's a
[25:45] conference but if you want to say Amen
[25:47] say
[25:49] amen amen glory be to the name of the
[25:53] Lord amen the Bible says in verse 26
[25:58] this is Jesus
[26:00] continuing he say ought not
[26:03] Christ to have
[26:05] suffered these things and to enter into
[26:09] his glory in other word what happened
[26:12] was already
[26:14] prophesied so why are you troubled about
[26:18] it in other word what happened to me is
[26:21] exactly the Fulfillment of the
[26:26] scripture why you didn't believe the
[26:29] prophet and the Bible says in the
[26:31] following
[26:33] verse and beginning at
[26:37] Moses remember when we read Luke chapter
[26:41] 16 we said the law and the prophet who
[26:46] the one who brought the law is
[26:50] Moses the Bible say Moses brought the
[26:52] law so when they say the law they're
[26:55] talking about
[26:57] Moses you must have Moses and the
[27:00] prophet and Moses himself was a
[27:04] prophet so the law and the
[27:07] prophet were until
[27:10] John and John also was a
[27:13] prophet so the law is a
[27:16] prophet the prophet themselves and John
[27:20] also also was a prophet and John
[27:23] introduced the Lord Jesus Christ and
[27:26] Jesus Christ was a prophet
[27:29] because Moses said the Lord your God
[27:33] will send a prophet back unto me and
[27:36] that Prophet was Jesus Christ so the law
[27:40] Prophet The Prophet prophet and John
[27:44] Prophet and Jesus Christ Prophet are we
[27:48] together glory to the name of the Lord
[27:51] amen now you begin to get really
[27:54] relaxed amen amen praise God the Bible
[28:00] says in verse
[28:02] 27 and beginning at Moses if you don't
[28:06] mind can you bring this board right here
[28:08] yes sir so we make sure where we stay
[28:10] together I Feel
[28:15] Home glory be to the name of the
[28:18] Lord
[28:20] amen this is a very vial
[28:23] subject so we need to go
[28:26] slowly amen amen I'm going to put it
[28:29] together so we don't lose track we
[28:32] talked about the
[28:34] Law plus the
[28:37] prophet everybody can see this you can
[28:40] all see this the law and the
[28:44] prophets until
[28:46] John and we found out that the prophet
[28:49] never stop
[28:51] never and the Bible says here that when
[28:54] Jesus begin to
[28:56] preach to those
[28:59] to open their eyes so that they can
[29:02] recognize
[29:04] him because the disciple were
[29:07] blinded Jesus begin to talk about
[29:11] Moses and Moses is the
[29:15] law are we together amen you want to
[29:18] take note that's
[29:20] fine amen amen the Bible says verse
[29:24] 27 and beginning at Moses
[29:28] why did Jesus start only by
[29:31] Moses why he didn't start by
[29:34] Abraham why he didn't start by
[29:38] Joseph why he didn't pick up
[29:40] Jacob but for some reason Jesus went
[29:43] straight and pick
[29:45] Moses and the Bible say he began by
[29:49] Moses and all the prophet
[29:54] prophets Moses again Plus all the
[30:01] prophet amen amen the Bible say and he
[30:04] be beginning at
[30:06] Moses and all the prophet he expanded
[30:11] unto
[30:12] them in other words he explained them he
[30:16] expanded unto them in all the
[30:19] scripture the things concerning
[30:23] himself so Jesus to explain himself
[30:28] he used the
[30:31] prophet are we together the law is a
[30:36] prophet the prophet were a prophet in
[30:39] order for Jesus to explain himself to
[30:42] his own
[30:44] disciple that were blinded Jesus never
[30:47] told them I am Jesus
[30:49] Christ Jesus went through the law he
[30:53] went through a prophet Called Moses
[30:58] are the prophet and begin to explain
[31:01] himself through the
[31:03] prophet in other word the prophet were
[31:06] not really talking about
[31:09] themselves the prophet were talking
[31:12] about Jesus
[31:14] Christ and I'm going to shock you a
[31:16] little
[31:17] bit how many knows that David was a
[31:22] prophet do you know
[31:24] that I see few hands so I have to to
[31:28] read it for you I don't want you to say
[31:30] brother Steven
[31:32] say when you leave this place you always
[31:34] say the Bible
[31:36] say are we together let's go to the book
[31:39] of
[31:43] act the book of act the book of Acts act
[31:54] act glory to God I believe it's chapter
[31:58] 1 act
[32:07] one if you dare you can say amen
[32:13] amen let me get the scripture where he
[32:15] speak
[32:18] about
[32:20] David
[32:25] David so you make sure you keep it
[32:31] in glory to God
[32:37] GL amen amen give me a minute and I'm
[32:41] going to find it I didn't prepare it but
[32:43] I'm going to find it
[32:55] mhm let's go to act two actually verse
[33:06] 30 you
[33:08] there let's go by verse 29 so you can
[33:12] get the
[33:13] background the Bible says men and
[33:17] Brethren let me freely speak unto
[33:20] you of the patriarch
[33:23] who what's the name there David that he
[33:28] is both dead and buried and his sep is
[33:33] with us until this day therefore David
[33:39] being a
[33:41] prophet so David was a prophet can you
[33:45] say Amen David was a prophet and I told
[33:49] you that Prophet were talking about
[33:51] Jesus Christ but the reason why I picked
[33:55] David is to show you another another ECT
[33:58] of a
[33:59] prophet the Bible say in the book of
[34:02] Psalm that David one day was
[34:06] crying and David said my God my God why
[34:11] has thou
[34:13] forsaken and David being a prophet was
[34:16] crying under the anointing of
[34:19] God but we found out that later when the
[34:23] god came to
[34:25] David if you go to David there was no
[34:29] scripture that shows that David was
[34:33] crucified David was speaking about Jesus
[34:37] Christ and if you stood by David you
[34:41] would have thought that David was
[34:44] talking about himself but he was not
[34:46] really talking about himself he was
[34:49] actually talking about what Jesus would
[34:51] do at the
[34:53] cross because when Jesus was crucified
[34:57] repeated the word of David and he said
[35:01] my God my God why has Thou forsaken me
[35:04] in other word
[35:06] Prophet not only did they spoke about
[35:09] Christ not only did they prophesy about
[35:13] Christ but they were acting as Jesus
[35:18] Christ they behave like
[35:21] God are we
[35:23] together the law and the prophet went
[35:27] until John the law Moses a prophet
[35:32] Prophet Prophet Propet John Prophet and
[35:35] Jesus to explain the
[35:37] scripture he started by a prophet
[35:41] Moses all the way to
[35:44] Prophet to explain about
[35:47] himself now let's go to the book of
[35:49] Hebrew chapter
[35:53] one if you thereare you can say amen
[35:57] amen amen Hebrew 1 verse
[36:04] one Hebrew chapter 1 verse one I'm
[36:08] taking this as a Sunday
[36:09] school According to Hebrew 1 verse
[36:13] one the Bible say
[36:16] God who at
[36:20] time in other word God in Me In many
[36:24] times in several time the Bible say God
[36:29] who at time and in diverse
[36:35] manners spake in
[36:38] past unto the
[36:40] father by the
[36:43] prophets by the
[36:46] prophets so everything I just spoke to
[36:49] you is summarized
[36:51] here God in the old time when he want to
[36:56] talk to the father to the children of
[36:58] Israel he always used a
[37:02] prophet are we together together verse
[37:05] two God has in these last
[37:09] days spoken unto us by his son in other
[37:14] word Paul is saying here that in the Old
[37:18] Testament God was talking to us through
[37:22] prophets but in these last
[37:25] days God spoke to us through his his own
[37:28] son which was the Lord who was the Lord
[37:31] Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ himself
[37:34] was a
[37:35] prophet but why are you talking about
[37:39] Prophet our theme is
[37:42] about the Holy Spirit in all
[37:46] aspect when God created
[37:50] man in the Garden of Eden the bible say
[37:54] that God created man
[37:57] in his own
[37:59] image and in his own
[38:02] likeness and if you go back in Genesis
[38:06] one God never use a
[38:09] prophet to talk to his
[38:12] children God spoke to his
[38:14] children
[38:17] directly how many knows
[38:19] that few hands
[38:22] left let's go to the Bible let's go to
[38:25] Genesis
[38:30] I want to make sure everybody is on the
[38:32] same
[38:33] page don't take my word take the Holy
[38:38] Scripture amen let's go to Genesis
[38:42] chapter
[38:43] one verse
[38:46] [Music]
[38:48] 20
[38:50] 26 the Bible says this and God say let
[38:55] us make man
[38:58] in our image after our
[39:01] likeness and let let
[39:04] them have dominion over the fish of the
[39:07] sea over the foul of the earth and over
[39:11] the cattle and over all the Earth and
[39:15] over every creeping
[39:17] thing that creepeth upon the Earth so
[39:22] God created man in his own image in the
[39:26] image of God created he him male and
[39:32] female created he them and God blessed
[39:37] them right here God have not spoken to
[39:41] his children
[39:42] yet he created them and he spoke to them
[39:46] and he's blessing them and the Bible say
[39:48] God blessed them and God say unto them
[39:53] now God is talking to them do you see a
[39:56] prophet here
[39:58] God at the beginning spoke to his
[40:01] children lip to
[40:04] ear directly without a prophet and the
[40:08] Bible say he say be
[40:11] fruitful and
[40:12] multiply and replenish the Earth and
[40:16] subdue it and have dominion over the
[40:19] fish of the
[40:20] sea over the foul of the earth and over
[40:24] every living things that moveth upon the
[40:26] Earth
[40:28] and God said behold I have given
[40:32] you so what I'm showing here is God is
[40:36] talking to his children
[40:40] directly go to Genesis
[40:42] 2 verse
[40:45] S the Bible says and the Lord God for
[40:51] Men Out of the Dust of the ground the
[40:55] man of Genesis one
[40:58] God form him as a
[41:00] spirit but in Genesis 2 God created the
[41:04] body that will receive the spirit that's
[41:08] why when you die your body goes to the
[41:12] Grave Spirit return back to God are we
[41:16] together and the Bible say and the Lord
[41:19] God form Men Out of the Dust of the
[41:22] ground and breathe into his
[41:25] nostril the Breath of Life
[41:28] and Man became a living
[41:30] Soul drop to verse
[41:33] 15 the Bible says and the Lord God took
[41:36] the man and and put him into the Garden
[41:39] of Eden to dress it and to keep it and
[41:44] the Lord commanded the
[41:47] man saying of every tree of the garden
[41:52] that may itat freely to eat that may
[41:56] freely eat if you notice here God even
[41:59] when he put men in this
[42:02] body God spoke to men
[42:06] directly there was never a prophet there
[42:09] let's go to uh Genesis chapter
[42:14] 3 I'm establishing something
[42:17] there let's go to verse
[42:20] seven if you dare you can say amen amen
[42:24] the Bible says after the fall
[42:28] after Adam and
[42:29] Eve when they ate the
[42:32] fruit their eyes were open the Bible
[42:35] says and the eyes of them both were
[42:39] open and they knew that they were
[42:42] naked and they sued fig leaves
[42:46] together and made thems
[42:49] apron and they
[42:52] heard the voice of the Lord God
[42:58] working let me ask you a
[43:00] question can your voice
[43:04] work I'm asking you a question but the
[43:07] bible say that the voice was working in
[43:11] other word God and His Voice are
[43:16] one God was
[43:18] walking and his voice was walking so God
[43:22] and His Voice are
[43:24] one are we together sometime if it's I'm
[43:29] I'm looking at brother Joe here if
[43:32] brother Joe is coming there and I didn't
[43:35] see him yet and I hear his voice and
[43:39] maybe he's talking and I know him very
[43:41] well I will tell you that brother Joe is
[43:46] coming but what I heard is not really
[43:49] the man
[43:50] Joe but I heard his voice but because
[43:54] the voice and the man are one
[43:57] the Bible say the voice of God was
[43:59] walking in word God was
[44:02] walking are we together glory to God the
[44:07] Bible say and they heard the voice of
[44:09] the Lord God
[44:11] Walking In The Garden of in the garden
[44:15] in the cool of the day and Adam and his
[44:18] wife
[44:20] HIDs from the presence so The Voice have
[44:24] a
[44:25] presence amen and he said from the
[44:28] presence of the
[44:29] Lord God Among the Trees of the garden
[44:33] and the Lord God called unto
[44:36] Adam and say unto him where are thou God
[44:41] didn't tell a prophet to call
[44:44] Adam God himself called Adam what I'm
[44:48] trying to establish here is from the
[44:52] beginning God spoke to men
[44:55] directly God created man so he can talk
[44:58] to man
[44:59] directly but we found out that the Bible
[45:02] says in the book of Hebrew that God was
[45:06] speaking to the father through the
[45:08] prophet so something changed
[45:11] somehow instead of God talking directly
[45:14] to his children now God establish a new
[45:18] order and according to the New Order God
[45:21] begin to talk to men through
[45:24] prophets together very much we see I see
[45:27] a lot of sisters
[45:30] here so let me make sure you are also
[45:32] included to what we are
[45:34] talking let's continue our scripture
[45:37] because here they call Adam and Adam
[45:40] will answer but I will show you that God
[45:42] also talk to his
[45:44] daughter so you can be also comfortable
[45:48] are we together the Bible says in verse
[45:51] uh uh
[45:53] 11 Adam is answering and he said or God
[45:58] is talking actually who T thee that thou
[46:01] are
[46:03] naked has thou eaten of the tree whereof
[46:05] I command the that th shall not
[46:08] eat and the man say the woman whom th
[46:12] Gest to be with
[46:14] me she gave me of the tree and I did eat
[46:20] and the Lord God say unto the
[46:23] woman if you notice God didn't tell ad
[46:27] to tell
[46:28] Eve God direct turn directly to
[46:32] Eve so God from the beginning talk to
[46:37] men and women
[46:41] directly are we together this is what
[46:44] I'm trying to establish but we see here
[46:47] that for some reason God is talking
[46:51] through the
[46:52] prophet are we together now let's go to
[46:55] the book of Peter
[46:58] glory to
[47:00] God second Peter verse
[47:03] [Music]
[47:04] one glory to
[47:07] God the holy spirit in all
[47:11] aspects brother Steven it's the holy
[47:14] spirit in all aspect are you talking
[47:17] about Prophet what does Prophet have to
[47:20] do with the holy
[47:22] spirit amen I was expecting you to start
[47:26] about telling us about what is the holy
[47:30] spirit we will get there by the grace of
[47:34] God but let's go first to second Peter
[47:37] verse one if you dare you at chapter
[47:41] one let's go to verse 20 remember the
[47:45] law and the prophet until John and when
[47:50] Jesus be wanted to explain about
[47:52] himself he Begin by a prophet Moses and
[47:57] all the prophet to explain himself who
[48:00] was a prophet are we together now what
[48:05] does the
[48:06] prophet have to do with the Holy
[48:10] Ghost second Peter chapter 1 verse 20
[48:15] the Bible says this knowing this
[48:19] first Peter want you to know this
[48:23] first before you start anything you need
[48:25] to know this first
[48:27] in other words you need to begin
[48:29] here what do we what are we supposed to
[48:32] know
[48:34] first knowing this first in other words
[48:38] begin
[48:39] here
[48:41] that no
[48:43] Prophecy of the scripture is of any
[48:47] private
[48:48] interpretation in other word no one can
[48:51] just take this
[48:52] Bible and just begin to explain it any
[48:55] way they want
[48:59] why
[49:00] why why why is the Bible so
[49:04] sacred that before you interpret it you
[49:08] need to know this
[49:09] first what is the
[49:12] principle that Peter want us to
[49:15] know before you can interpret the
[49:19] Bible verse
[49:21] 21 the Bible say for the
[49:25] prophecy came not in all
[49:29] time remember in the old time God was
[49:32] talking through
[49:33] prophet those Prophecy of the old
[49:36] time the bible say that for the
[49:39] prophecy came not in the old time by the
[49:43] will of man in other word when Moses
[49:47] spoke it was not the will of Moses when
[49:51] David spoke it was not the will of David
[49:55] when the prophet spoke it was not the
[49:57] will of the
[49:58] Prophet it was the will of God they were
[50:02] expressing God that's why God could
[50:06] refer to them in other word it was God
[50:10] in the
[50:11] prophet are we together are we together
[50:16] the Bible say in verse 21 for the
[50:19] prophecy came not in the old
[50:22] time by the will of man but holy man of
[50:26] God
[50:27] those holy men of God were
[50:29] prophets in other word prophets holy men
[50:33] of God
[50:36] spake as they were moved by the Holy
[50:40] Ghost now you begin to understand before
[50:44] I can talk about the Holy Ghost I need
[50:47] to talk about the
[50:48] prophet all the prophets were speaking
[50:52] by the Holy
[50:55] Ghost that's why why Jesus have to refer
[50:58] to
[50:59] them because he was not Prophet speaking
[51:03] he was not human being speaking he was
[51:06] the Holy Ghost in the prophet that were
[51:10] talking that's the reason why what the
[51:14] prophet spoke
[51:16] happened because he was not men talking
[51:20] he was God the Holy Spirit talking
[51:24] through the
[51:25] prophet are we together but brother
[51:29] Steven you have just
[51:32] established that in the Garden of Eden
[51:35] God was talking to men and to women
[51:40] directly so what
[51:43] change that the Holy Ghost now instead
[51:46] of talking to the children of God
[51:50] directly now the Holy Ghost have to
[51:54] use prophet in order talk to the
[51:57] children of what
[52:01] happened why let's go to the Book of
[52:05] Exodus
[52:08] ex God after the
[52:12] fall begin to walk with
[52:16] Prophet Exodus chapter
[52:19] 20 and when we begin to walk with the
[52:24] prophet God picked up a nation
[52:28] a nation called
[52:30] Israel are we together and then when God
[52:34] brought
[52:36] Israel God told
[52:38] Moses go to Egypt and go get my people
[52:43] God called them my people and bring them
[52:46] together so that they can worship
[52:49] me amen remember Jesus started by
[52:53] Moses so Moses went and pick up people
[52:57] from
[52:59] Egypt people that were under
[53:02] slavery people that were working for the
[53:06] devil people that were
[53:09] smoking people that were
[53:11] drinking people that were working for
[53:14] the devil and Moses went and took them
[53:19] from the slavery of the devil and
[53:22] brought them out so that the people can
[53:26] begin to serve the
[53:27] Lord and when God rescue those
[53:32] people or redeemed those
[53:35] people God told Israel bring Israel to
[53:39] me I want to talk to Israel face to
[53:44] face God wanted to start what what fell
[53:48] in
[53:51] Eden because in
[53:53] Eden God was talking to man and to women
[53:57] directly and then men corrupt themselves
[54:01] God have to destroy Men by the
[54:05] flood and then God started by a man
[54:07] called
[54:08] Abraham and from Abraham Isaac from
[54:12] Isaac Jacob from Jacob came all the
[54:15] tribes and then they created the nation
[54:18] of Israel so now God pick up a specific
[54:22] nation and when he brought that Nation
[54:25] God say I'm want to start another Eden
[54:29] here where I can talk to a
[54:32] people directly to
[54:35] them this is where we are in Exodus
[54:38] chapter 20 what happened when God offer
[54:42] to Israel to talk to them directly like
[54:48] Adam and Eve God told them sanctify
[54:52] yourself cleanse yourself come to me let
[54:56] meet at the mountain of
[54:58] s on the mountain of
[55:00] Horeb Horeb and S is the same Mountain
[55:04] it's just different name let's meet
[55:07] together so I can talk to you this is
[55:09] where we are we're talking about the
[55:11] Holy Spirit in all aspects and remember
[55:15] the Holy Spirit was working through the
[55:18] prophet are we together let's go to
[55:21] Exodus 20 verse
[55:24] 18 if you dare you can can say amen amen
[55:28] the Bible says and all the
[55:31] people saw the
[55:34] thundering and the
[55:36] Lightnings and the noise of the
[55:39] trumpet and the mountain
[55:41] smoking and when the people stow
[55:45] it they
[55:47] remove and stood far off God told them
[55:51] approach me and when God came down were
[55:56] thundering they were smoking they were
[56:00] all kind of
[56:01] demonstration when the people saw the
[56:04] demonstration of God they say no no no
[56:07] no we need to back up a little bit
[56:10] somebody can get killed here God who
[56:13] invited them to approach now men begin
[56:16] to go
[56:18] backwards because of the
[56:20] demonstration that happened on
[56:24] more let's continue continue verse
[56:27] 19 and
[56:29] they the people said to Moses remember
[56:34] Jesus began by Moses and and they say to
[56:38] Moses speak th unto with
[56:42] us and we will
[56:44] hear but let not
[56:47] God speak with us L we
[56:52] die God told them come to me
[56:56] and I'm going to talk to you how can God
[56:59] kill you when he want to talk to
[57:02] you but when God come down and display
[57:06] his power Israel backed off and
[57:10] say Moses you talk to us in other word
[57:15] you go to God and talk to God and take
[57:20] the message from God and bring us the
[57:23] message and we will hear from this
[57:26] because if we hear from God we will die
[57:30] but in the beginning Adam talked to God
[57:34] in the beginning if talk to God even
[57:38] Moses himself talk to God and Moses
[57:41] never died but when God took that
[57:45] opportunity and wanted to bring it to
[57:48] everybody human being
[57:51] rejected they say no no no no no no if
[57:54] we talk to God we will die you go talk
[57:58] to God bring us the message and we will
[58:02] hear and we will talk to you and you
[58:05] will take our message back
[58:07] to now man
[58:11] himself have
[58:13] introduced another
[58:15] office the office of a prophet that's
[58:20] why the Bible say God in
[58:25] s in the old time he was speaking to us
[58:29] through the prophet at the beginning God
[58:32] wanted to talk to
[58:34] you God wanted to talk to you God wanted
[58:37] to come down and talk to you my sister
[58:41] with that brother Jo God wanted to talk
[58:44] to you my sister without a pastor God
[58:47] want to talk to you my sister without a
[58:49] pastor God want to talk to you my
[58:51] brother without a pastor God want to
[58:54] talk to you Mama without a pastor God
[58:57] want to talk to you Church Li to here
[59:01] without a pastor God want to talk to you
[59:03] a
[59:04] work God want to talk to you in school
[59:07] God want to talk to you in your bedroom
[59:10] God want to talk to you in your bathroom
[59:12] God want to talk to you when you drive
[59:14] in your car he want to talk to you
[59:16] directly without a prophet but man
[59:20] introduce an office the office of a
[59:23] prophet Propet are we together amen
[59:27] that's why Prophet started before and
[59:31] even after the death of Jesus Christ
[59:34] Prophet continues are we together but
[59:37] don't stop there let's continue with our
[59:40] background let's go now to the book of
[59:43] Deuteronomy chapter
[59:45] 18 so we saw what happened in
[59:49] Horeb and according
[59:52] Tob man came down God came down
[59:56] remember the mountain is called
[59:59] Horeb it's another name for the mountain
[1:00:02] of
[1:00:04] s if you have a difficulty with that you
[1:00:07] see me after service I'll give you a
[1:00:09] scripture that shows that Horeb and S is
[1:00:12] the same thing so we got the mountain of
[1:00:16] s which we Call HB and remember what
[1:00:20] happened in Horeb here is that man refus
[1:00:23] to talk to God
[1:00:26] man
[1:00:27] desired that God talk to
[1:00:30] him through a
[1:00:33] prophet are we together let's go to
[1:00:37] Deuteronomy chapter
[1:00:39] 18 verse 15 if you dare you can say amen
[1:00:44] amen we're talking about the Holy Spirit
[1:00:47] in all aspect just hang tight and we're
[1:00:51] going to drop
[1:00:53] down if you thereare you can say Amen
[1:00:56] amen verse 15 the Bible say the Lord thy
[1:01:01] God will raise up unto
[1:01:04] thee a
[1:01:06] what a
[1:01:08] prophet from the midst of thee of th
[1:01:13] Breen like unto me unto
[1:01:17] him ye shall
[1:01:20] hearken in other word this
[1:01:24] decision was so strong until God himself
[1:01:30] was
[1:01:31] conditioned to come as a prophet in the
[1:01:37] person of the Lord Jesus Christ that's
[1:01:40] why Jesus was a prophet because God has
[1:01:43] to follow his own
[1:01:45] law are we together now verse 16 says
[1:01:51] God is telling them that I'm going to
[1:01:53] send you a prophet which was the Lord
[1:01:55] Jesus Christ like unto
[1:01:58] me why are you sending them why God do
[1:02:01] you want to come as a
[1:02:03] prophet God is explaining this in verse
[1:02:07] 16 he says according to
[1:02:13] all that that
[1:02:16] desirest of the Lord th
[1:02:19] God did you see that God is
[1:02:23] saying I answered your prayer
[1:02:27] and according to your prayer I'm going
[1:02:29] to send a big prophet and the big
[1:02:32] Prophet is
[1:02:33] myself and I'm coming according to what
[1:02:37] happened in hor what happened in horri
[1:02:41] you ask me whenever I want to talk to
[1:02:43] you I need to send you a prophet and
[1:02:47] because of that even if myself God I
[1:02:49] want to talk to you I'm going to come as
[1:02:52] a prophet because this is what you
[1:02:54] desire
[1:02:56] are we together very the Bible
[1:02:59] says that saying that let me not hear
[1:03:03] hear again the voice of the Lord my
[1:03:07] God let neither let me see this great
[1:03:11] fire
[1:03:12] anymore that I die not God is reminding
[1:03:16] them do you remember what you told me
[1:03:18] you don't want to see my demonstration
[1:03:20] you don't want to talk to me you want to
[1:03:22] hear me through a
[1:03:24] prophet verse 17
[1:03:26] and the Lord say unto me they have well
[1:03:31] spoken that which they have
[1:03:33] spoken I will raise them a
[1:03:37] prophet from among their
[1:03:40] Brethren like unto thee and I will put
[1:03:44] my word in the in his
[1:03:47] mouth and he shall speak unto
[1:03:50] them all that I shall command
[1:03:53] him so now if God God want to talk to
[1:03:57] people he need to use a
[1:04:02] prophet so now the order have changed
[1:04:07] again all the
[1:04:10] congregation are a little beit secluded
[1:04:12] from
[1:04:13] God and it seems like the one who talk
[1:04:16] to
[1:04:17] God is only a prophet so if you want to
[1:04:21] hear from God you need to go talk to the
[1:04:24] prophet because remember the Holy Ghost
[1:04:26] was talking through the prophet are we
[1:04:28] together if no Prophet God is
[1:04:32] silence you must have a prophet in other
[1:04:36] words the prophet now break the Silence
[1:04:38] of God so whenever you see a prophet you
[1:04:42] just get ready because God say that's
[1:04:46] the reason why when Prophet were
[1:04:50] appearing they always say that serve the
[1:04:54] Lord
[1:04:56] in other word it's not me speaking it is
[1:04:58] God talking now brother
[1:05:01] Steven what do the prophet have to do
[1:05:05] with the Holy
[1:05:07] Ghost now let's L down I have to build
[1:05:10] this background let's go to the book of
[1:05:15] numbers so if you want to talk to
[1:05:18] God you must be a special
[1:05:21] somebody somebody who's born
[1:05:24] prophet and everybody feel like you know
[1:05:27] what I'm not a prophet I cannot talk to
[1:05:31] God oh the prophet are the only one to
[1:05:35] whom the Holy Spirit goes
[1:05:39] to the pastor is the only one God can
[1:05:42] talk
[1:05:43] to if I want to hear from God I need see
[1:05:47] I need to talk to the
[1:05:49] pastor that's the way we behave
[1:05:52] today what is the Holy Ghost number
[1:05:56] chapter uh 11 if you dare you can say
[1:05:59] amen amen number let's go to verse 10
[1:06:03] vers thank you
[1:06:05] Jesus if you there you can say
[1:06:09] Amen number 11 verse 10 the Bible says
[1:06:13] then Moses heard the people
[1:06:16] weep throughout their
[1:06:18] families every man in the door of his T
[1:06:22] remember Jesus began by Moses remember
[1:06:26] Jesus began by Moses we are with Moses
[1:06:30] the law of prophets started by
[1:06:32] Moses right and Jesus began by
[1:06:36] Moses and the anger of the Lord was
[1:06:39] kinger
[1:06:41] greatly Moses also was
[1:06:44] displeased and Moses say unto the
[1:06:47] Lord wherefore has th Afflicted that
[1:06:51] Serv wherefore have I not found favor in
[1:06:54] that sight
[1:06:56] that that laid the burden of all these
[1:06:58] people upon
[1:07:01] me have I conceive all these
[1:07:04] people have I begotten
[1:07:06] them that that should say unto
[1:07:10] me carry them
[1:07:12] inom as a nursing
[1:07:15] father beareth the sucking child unto
[1:07:18] the land which th swearest unto their
[1:07:22] father in other word the burden of work
[1:07:27] the burden of
[1:07:30] work was so heavy upon
[1:07:33] Moses everybody Moses
[1:07:37] Moses if somebody have a problem they
[1:07:40] take their cell phone and call Moses
[1:07:43] Moses pray for my child mes I have a
[1:07:46] test tomorrow Moses I have a headache
[1:07:49] Moses I'm suffering from stomach trouble
[1:07:52] Moses I didn't sleep tonight Moses
[1:07:55] husband is angry with me Moses my my
[1:07:58] wife doesn't listen to me and Moses got
[1:08:01] tired too much burden and Moses turned
[1:08:05] unto God he said God why did you give me
[1:08:09] this big job you the one that told me to
[1:08:12] go get these people these are not my
[1:08:15] children why did you give me such a big
[1:08:18] burden like this why didn't you take
[1:08:20] care of
[1:08:23] themselves God look at Moses
[1:08:27] he say I understand you one
[1:08:31] man handling everybody and God is only
[1:08:35] speaking to one man and God told Moses
[1:08:38] something follow me carefully sir job to
[1:08:41] verse 16 says and God say and the Lord
[1:08:46] say unto
[1:08:47] Moses GA unto
[1:08:50] me 70
[1:08:53] men of the Elder of
[1:08:56] Israel were these people
[1:08:58] Prophet no no
[1:09:02] no God say Moses you tired the work is
[1:09:08] heavy get me 70 people of the elders
[1:09:13] bring them to me why what are you trying
[1:09:17] to do follow me
[1:09:18] [Music]
[1:09:20] carefully whom that knowest to be the
[1:09:22] Elder of the people
[1:09:25] officer over them and bring them onto
[1:09:28] the Tabernacle of the
[1:09:30] congregation that they may stand with
[1:09:34] thee and I the Lord will come down and
[1:09:40] talk
[1:09:42] with and I will take off thy
[1:09:46] Spirit which is upon thee and I will put
[1:09:50] it upon
[1:09:52] them remember Jesus begin to talk from
[1:09:56] Moses so the first person that God took
[1:10:01] a spirit from
[1:10:03] him and divide the
[1:10:06] spirit and put it in other people so
[1:10:10] that other people can begin to behave
[1:10:13] like
[1:10:16] Moses are we together it started by
[1:10:20] Moses so what happened on the day of
[1:10:23] Pentecost that the Spirit came down and
[1:10:27] divide himself into 120 people he didn't
[1:10:32] start over there there is a
[1:10:35] shadow there is a
[1:10:37] prefigure in the Old Testament it
[1:10:40] started by
[1:10:45] Moses god take a spirit that was on
[1:10:50] Moses but remember the Bible say Moses
[1:10:54] was a prophet
[1:10:56] and remember the Bible say the prophet
[1:10:59] were talking by the Holy
[1:11:00] Ghost so the spirit that was on Moses
[1:11:04] was the Holy Spirit In other word
[1:11:06] without the Holy Spirit God cannot talk
[1:11:09] to you
[1:11:11] directly so the Holy Spirit bring God to
[1:11:15] you the Holy Spirit bring a
[1:11:19] closeness between you and God until at a
[1:11:23] certain time
[1:11:25] will get
[1:11:26] confused whether it is you talking or it
[1:11:30] is God the Holy Spirit talking in you
[1:11:35] are we together are we together God say
[1:11:39] you know what bring me 70 people I'm
[1:11:42] going to take that Spirit from your

[1:11:49] the anointing from you the holy spirit
[1:11:52] that was working on you and I'm going to

[1:12:11] he went through
[1:12:13] 120 are we together very much are you
[1:12:16] together so that you cannot be the only
[1:12:19] agent everybody else can get
[1:12:21] it together we on verse 17
[1:12:26] and God say I will put it upon
[1:12:29] them and they shall bear the burden of
[1:12:31] the
[1:12:32] people that th bearest not thyself
[1:12:39] alone job to verse 24 now follow me
[1:12:42] carefully we're getting into our
[1:12:45] material and Moses went out and told the
[1:12:49] people the word of the
[1:12:50] Lord and gather the 70 men of the Elder
[1:12:54] of the people
[1:12:56] and and set them round about the
[1:12:59] Tabernacle and the Lord came
[1:13:02] down in the cloud and spake unto him and
[1:13:07] took off the
[1:13:10] spirit th was on him upon him and gave
[1:13:14] it unto 70
[1:13:17] elders and he came to
[1:13:20] pass follow me when the spirit rested
[1:13:24] upon them
[1:13:27] they

[1:13:36] Prophet but when the spirit of
[1:13:39] Prophecy Came Upon them they begin to
[1:13:43] behave like
[1:13:46] prophets are we together are we together
[1:13:50] let's continue verse 26
[1:13:53] verse but
[1:13:56] there remain two of
[1:13:58] them so when Moses call 70
[1:14:02] people not everybody
[1:14:06] came do you follow me only 68 people
[1:14:11] came and then two
[1:14:14] other were left in the
[1:14:17] camp so you who are

[1:20:04] 26 the Bible say but there remain two of
[1:20:07] the men in the
[1:20:09] camp the name of one was

[1:20:34] camp and there ran a young
[1:20:37] man and told Moses and say El and M do
[1:20:42] prophesy in the
[1:20:44] camp in other words somebody saw two men
[1:20:47] in the camp
[1:20:49] prophesy and he run to Moses said Moses
[1:20:52] Moses Moses we know that they only
[1:20:55] Prophet is you you are the only one that
[1:20:57] speak to God through us but we see two
[1:21:00] men over there that are prophesying in
[1:21:03] the camp verse
[1:21:05] [Music]
[1:21:08] 28 and
[1:21:10] Joshua the son of n the servant of Moses
[1:21:15] one of his young men answer and say my
[1:21:19] Lord uh my Lord Moses forbid them so
[1:21:23] when they report came Joshua who was
[1:21:27] like a body guard to Moses turn around
[1:21:30] he said Moses let's stop these people
[1:21:34] you the only one who need to
[1:21:36] speak why are they talking over there
[1:21:39] are we together job to verse
[1:21:42] 29 follow me carefully because I'm going
[1:21:44] to stop here and Moses say unto
[1:21:49] them
[1:21:51] this for my
[1:21:53] sake in other way are you jealous
[1:21:55] because of me God is using other people
[1:22:00] Joshua what is your
[1:22:06] problem what is your problem what
[1:22:09] problem so a pastor should be
[1:22:13] happy when a young brother or a young
[1:22:17] sister is coming and say Pastor the Lord
[1:22:20] spoke to me last a mother coming to a
[1:22:23] pastor and say the Lord spoke to me
[1:22:27] Father coming and say the Lord spoke to
[1:22:30] me Moses say what's wrong with you
[1:22:34] Joshua because we know the order the
[1:22:37] order is God only speak to prophets
[1:22:40] these are not prophets and they are and
[1:22:43] they are acting like you they are
[1:22:46] prophesying like you we need to stop
[1:22:48] them say
[1:22:50] Joshua are you jealous remember Jesus
[1:22:54] Begin by
[1:22:55] Moses are we together let's continue and
[1:22:59] then we stop this verse and Moses say
[1:23:03] unto him envious that for my sake follow
[1:23:07] me carefully he say would
[1:23:11] God remember he was only 70 people but
[1:23:15] listen to Moses he said would
[1:23:17] God that
[1:23:22] 70 is that what the Bible says
[1:23:26] Ah that's the way I catch if you're
[1:23:28] listening to
[1:23:30] me would God that how many
[1:23:34] people how many people all the people
[1:23:38] God that all the Lord's
[1:23:44] water in other word
[1:23:47] everybody the entire
[1:23:50] congregation Moses is telling Joshua are
[1:23:54] you of me would God that all the Lord's
[1:23:59] people
[1:24:01] were our
[1:24:03] [Music]
[1:24:05] wish is that the entire
[1:24:09] Congregation of is be Prophet
[1:24:13] Propet yes
[1:24:15] sir he said would God that all the
[1:24:19] Lord's people were
[1:24:21] prophet and that the Lord will put his
[1:24:27] Spirit upon
[1:24:32] them and let
[1:24:34] me close with
[1:24:37] this the first
[1:24:39] person who had the spirit of the Lord
[1:24:42] working on
[1:24:44] him and God came and took that Spirit
[1:24:48] follow me
[1:24:50] carefully and God selected 70 people
[1:24:55] and then God dropped the spirit upon 70
[1:24:59] people because their name were
[1:25:02] written but when Moses
[1:25:05] came Moses didn't stop at
[1:25:09] 70 Moses
[1:25:11] extended from
[1:25:13] 70 to an unlimited
[1:25:17] number what are you trying to say in
[1:25:20] other word Moses is telling Israel that
[1:25:23] the promise is not only unto me Moses it
[1:25:28] is not only unto the 70 but the promise
[1:25:32] is unto
[1:25:34] many as the Lord your God will call and
[1:25:39] on the day of P God came down in a
[1:25:43] selected group of 120 people and he
[1:25:48] baptized only 120 people but one day
[1:25:53] when Peter was preached
[1:25:55] and he said repent and be baptized in
[1:25:58] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:26:01] you will receive the gift of the Holy
[1:26:04] Spirit and Peter as Moses extended the
[1:26:08] promise he said for the promise is not
[1:26:11] is unto you you who are listening me and
[1:26:15] as many as the Lord your God will call
[1:26:20] in other words the promise of the holy
[1:26:22] spirit is not only unto the
[1:26:25] 12 it's not only unto the Jews the
[1:26:29] promise of the holy spirit is also for
[1:26:32] you you need to be baptized with the
[1:26:35] Holy Spirit you need to receive the
[1:26:38] portion of the Holy Ghost because before
[1:26:41] the foundation of the world God put your
[1:26:44] name in the L book of and God want you
[1:26:48] to receive the Holy Spirit God richly

[1:46:38] amen everybody
[1:46:41] happy praise
[1:46:43] God Amen can you hear me
[1:46:46] okay amen amen amen amen just a recab
[1:46:54] the
[1:46:55] law and the prophet all the way onto
[1:47:00] John the law is
[1:47:03] Moses who was a prophet and then we got
[1:47:07] all the prophets we got John the Baptist
[1:47:10] who was also a
[1:47:11] prophet and then he introduced Jesus
[1:47:14] Christ the prophet because he was the
[1:47:17] prophet of the prophet and Jesus when he
[1:47:19] begin to talk he started by Moses
[1:47:24] all the way through the prophet about
[1:47:27] the things that concern
[1:47:29] himself and we found out that this
[1:47:31] Prophet God in the old time in time was
[1:47:36] speaking through the father through the
[1:47:39] prophet and in the last day he spoke
[1:47:42] through Jesus
[1:47:43] Christ and the prophet did not
[1:47:47] seize the office
[1:47:50] continue but the desire of God
[1:47:54] always has been that God want to speak
[1:47:57] to his children
[1:48:00] directly God talking to the
[1:48:03] pastor God talking to the
[1:48:05] Deacon God talking to the pastor's
[1:48:08] wife talking to the father to the mother
[1:48:12] to the older to the younger God want to
[1:48:16] speak to everybody but the office still
[1:48:19] remain and for those who take note
[1:48:23] in Ephesians
[1:48:25] 4 verse 11 and 12 the Bible gives the
[1:48:31] offices the Bible says that he gave unto
[1:48:34] some Apostle some Prophet so the office
[1:48:38] of a prophet is still
[1:48:40] valid and the second scripture it's in 1
[1:48:44] Corinthians 12 verse
[1:48:47] 28 if you go home and you read those
[1:48:50] scripture you will see that the office
[1:48:52] of a
[1:48:53] prophet is also established in the New
[1:48:57] Testament the office is still there
[1:49:01] Moses is still there the disciple are
[1:49:03] still there but God want to fill more
[1:49:07] people you know that Mary the mother of
[1:49:10] Jesus Christ was among the
[1:49:14] 120 do you know that do you know that so
[1:49:18] the Holy Spirit fell on men and
[1:49:21] women didn't only fall on the 12
[1:49:24] apostles he fell upon 120 people so God
[1:49:30] even though there is a
[1:49:32] Moses God can drop the spirit upon 70
[1:49:35] people and not only 70 people but the
[1:49:39] true desire of God that was expressed
[1:49:43] through
[1:49:43] Moses is that the entire
[1:49:47] Israel become prophet and God can drop
[1:49:51] his Spirit upon them because to begin
[1:49:54] with
[1:49:55] INB God called all
[1:49:58] Israel talk to them face to face it was
[1:50:02] Israel that backed off but God still
[1:50:06] desired to talk to his children as
[1:50:09] parent we want to talk to our
[1:50:11] children God also have his own children
[1:50:15] and God want to talk to his children and
[1:50:17] the only way you can talk to him
[1:50:21] adequately to be
[1:50:23] with him you need to have the same
[1:50:26] spirit so when God
[1:50:28] speak you also
[1:50:30] speak how many here knows what a magnet
[1:50:35] is if you remember a magnet if you take
[1:50:38] a magnet and you chip
[1:50:41] it and you take the little piece of a
[1:50:44] magnet and you put it somewhere and you
[1:50:48] take the big magnet for those who who
[1:50:51] played with that
[1:50:53] if you move the magnet like
[1:50:55] this you will see that the magnet has a
[1:50:58] power of
[1:51:00] Attraction and you will notice the
[1:51:02] little magnet will begin to move
[1:51:06] according to the direction of the big
[1:51:08] magnet so that's the same way God
[1:51:11] operates so God take a portion of his
[1:51:14] spirit and he put in new so when God
[1:51:18] move you move if God goes to the right
[1:51:20] you go to the right God speak you speak
[1:51:24] if God is quiet you quiet how do you
[1:51:27] know God is speaking because the same
[1:51:30] thing that is in God is in
[1:51:32] me the difference is only in a
[1:51:35] portion are we together now we
[1:51:38] understand that the desire of God
[1:51:41] expressed through Moses is that God want
[1:51:45] everybody to have his
[1:51:48] spirit amen now let's go to Isaiah 44 is
[1:51:53] you can get your Bible Isaiah
[1:51:58] 44 Isaiah 44 verse
[1:52:03] one if you there you can say
[1:52:08] Amen pages are still turning Isaiah
[1:52:13] 44 verse
[1:52:15] one the Bible says yet now hear oh
[1:52:20] Jacob my servant
[1:52:23] and
[1:52:24] isra whom I have
[1:52:26] chosen there is a choosing going on just
[1:52:30] like God chose the
[1:52:32] 70 the Bible says in verse
[1:52:35] two th sayith the Lord that made thee
[1:52:40] and formed thee from the womb God is
[1:52:45] talking to you the god that form you in
[1:52:48] the womb of your mother is talking to
[1:52:51] you what is God talking to the bible say
[1:52:55] that sa the Lord that made thee in other
[1:52:59] words the god that created you and
[1:53:02] formed thee from the
[1:53:05] womb which will help
[1:53:07] thee same God that create
[1:53:10] you the same God that formed you the
[1:53:13] same God that watch over your
[1:53:16] pregnancy the same God that will help
[1:53:18] you if you going through trouble God
[1:53:22] will not forsake you he was with you
[1:53:25] before the foundation of the world and
[1:53:28] God was with you in your mother's and
[1:53:31] God is telling you tonight he will help
[1:53:33] you he has not stopped when you came out
[1:53:36] from your mother's God didn't stop God
[1:53:40] will go with you all the
[1:53:42] way the Bible says he will help you fear
[1:53:46] not oh Jacob my servant oh
[1:53:52] whom I have chosen follow me carefully
[1:53:56] verse three for I will pour out I will
[1:54:00] pour water upon him that is
[1:54:07] thirsty God is saying here he will pour
[1:54:12] water upon somebody who
[1:54:17] thirsty so if you don't thirst for
[1:54:20] it is God going to give it to you
[1:54:23] so to have that water you must yearn for
[1:54:26] it you must desire for it you must test
[1:54:30] for
[1:54:31] it because there is a law when there is
[1:54:35] a
[1:54:36] deep David said it that is calling there
[1:54:41] got to be a deep to
[1:54:42] respond if you have a thirst of water
[1:54:46] it's already telling you that water is
[1:54:48] somewhere that's the reason why you
[1:54:50] tting
[1:54:52] in your body is
[1:54:55] insufficient become low and the Deep
[1:54:59] over there calling to another water and
[1:55:03] God is saying that if you thirsty he
[1:55:06] will pour a water upon you how many
[1:55:08] people tonight want God to pour a water
[1:55:11] upon you if you want God to pour a water
[1:55:14] upon you you must thirst for God you
[1:55:18] must yearn for God you must desire God
[1:55:22] you must have a painful
[1:55:24] desire that God I want you in my life
[1:55:28] and there is a promise in your Bible
[1:55:31] that if you thirst for
[1:55:33] me I will p a water upon
[1:55:36] you are we together the Bible says verse
[1:55:40] three for I not somebody else not a
[1:55:45] pastor it is God himself I will pour
[1:55:48] water upon him that is thirsty
[1:55:53] and
[1:55:54] floods upon the dry ground follow me
[1:55:58] carefully I will pour my
[1:56:02] spirit upon th
[1:56:05] seed and my
[1:56:07] blessing upon The Offspring so Isaiah
[1:56:12] already begin to prophesy that God is
[1:56:16] looking for a time that he will pour His
[1:56:19] Spirit upon his seed
[1:56:22] upon his children God don't want his
[1:56:25] children to be
[1:56:26] empty God don't want you to come to
[1:56:29] church empty God don't want you to come
[1:56:32] to church to warm
[1:56:33] pews God don't want you to come to
[1:56:36] church to have
[1:56:37] religion God want you to have his spirit
[1:56:41] so that when God is talking something in
[1:56:44] you is rejoicing something in you is
[1:56:47] Happy God don't want you to come to
[1:56:49] church and you
[1:56:51] sad want you to come to church and you
[1:56:53] fell
[1:56:55] asleep when they're talking about him
[1:56:58] God don't want you to come to church and
[1:56:59] you sitting like you don't feel like
[1:57:01] being in
[1:57:02] church God don't want you to come to
[1:57:04] church and you put your hand like this
[1:57:06] something is going on God want you to
[1:57:09] come to church when they begin to talk
[1:57:11] about him your heart is already
[1:57:13] rejoicing you can't help to say Amen you
[1:57:17] can't help to say praise the Lord you
[1:57:19] can't help to say that is the truth
[1:57:21] because something in you is
[1:57:24] burning because there is a
[1:57:27] promise that God want to pour His Spirit
[1:57:32] up are we
[1:57:34] clear
[1:57:36] now where does the Holy Ghost
[1:57:41] go because now we we understand the
[1:57:44] desire of God God want to talk to you
[1:57:48] directly without anybody he want to tell
[1:57:51] you he
[1:57:53] he want to tell you don't wake up in the
[1:57:55] morning and go to the right he want to
[1:57:58] tell you when you wake up do not take uh
[1:58:00] I inan the highway use a different road
[1:58:03] because there is an accident you want a
[1:58:06] god that is
[1:58:08] living not a god of History not a god of
[1:58:12] the pastors only only the pastor tell
[1:58:15] you God Tau me God
[1:58:17] told no you must have a testimony that
[1:58:20] God also talked to me
[1:58:22] that I was reading the the Bible and a
[1:58:25] voice spoke to me I was going this way
[1:58:28] and something told me go check my child
[1:58:31] and you go you check the child and you
[1:58:33] find something that's the God we want
[1:58:36] are we together exactly but if that God
[1:58:39] comes if God pour the spirit where does
[1:58:43] the spirit
[1:58:46] go are we together mhm let's go to the
[1:58:50] book of Deuteronomy I
[1:58:52] chapter
[1:58:56] 10 you know
[1:58:58] God as you going through the scripture
[1:59:01] told
[1:59:03] Israel he started that with
[1:59:06] Abraham when God call
[1:59:09] Abraham God separate
[1:59:12] Abraham you know the story very well
[1:59:15] it's in Genesis 12 God say Abraham come
[1:59:18] out from your people come out for your
[1:59:21] king come out from your family let's go
[1:59:24] to a land that I will show you when
[1:59:28] Abraham
[1:59:29] moved if you look at Abraham and you
[1:59:32] look at everybody else they look
[1:59:35] alike you cannot
[1:59:37] tell who God is talking
[1:59:40] to and who God is not talking to in
[1:59:43] other word Abraham looked like everybody
[1:59:47] he dressed like everybody you cannot
[1:59:50] tell that this is the one God is talking
[1:59:54] to and this one is the one God is not
[1:59:57] talking so when God separate Abraham
[2:00:00] Abraham begin to form his own
[2:00:03] family with his servant and when God
[2:00:07] looked at
[2:00:08] Abraham he say Abraham I must make some
[2:00:13] distinction between you and everybody
[2:00:16] else so
[2:00:19] that if they want to know
[2:00:22] who is in your house who belong to your
[2:00:26] Camp who belong to your country who
[2:00:31] belong to your tribe if they check that
[2:00:36] son only Abraham
[2:00:39] family only Abraham
[2:00:42] servant only Abraham
[2:00:45] people have the mark of
[2:00:48] Distinction everybody else doesn't have
[2:00:52] if you don't have it it means you don't
[2:00:54] live in the house of Abraham because
[2:00:57] it's a mark of
[2:00:59] Distinction maybe several of you here
[2:01:02] have American passport if you go
[2:01:05] somewhere they told you who are you you
[2:01:08] will say I'm an
[2:01:10] American what shows that you're an
[2:01:12] American you say oh because I speak
[2:01:14] English there are people who speak
[2:01:16] English in South America there are
[2:01:19] people who speak English in Canada there
[2:01:21] are people who speak English in
[2:01:23] Europe I mean England started with
[2:01:26] English there are people who speak
[2:01:28] English in Africa what shows that
[2:01:30] because you speak English you an
[2:01:33] American you must carry a passport that
[2:01:36] shows that you in American when you
[2:01:39] bring your passport out we can tell that
[2:01:41] you're an American because to be a true
[2:01:44] American you must have an American
[2:01:47] passport are we together if you pull
[2:01:50] your blood you say blood is an American
[2:01:53] everybody's blood can be American but
[2:01:56] there is a certain
[2:01:58] distinction there is a certain
[2:02:01] identity that if you show that identity
[2:02:04] everybody at the airport will open the
[2:02:08] gate and say welcome to America because
[2:02:11] you carry the identity of America and
[2:02:14] God told Abraham I'm going to give you
[2:02:17] an
[2:02:18] identity and that identity when you
[2:02:22] it means that person and me God we are
[2:02:26] in a covenant and that's Mark was called
[2:02:32] circumcision are we together yes sir and
[2:02:34] God told Abraham every
[2:02:37] male that is in your uh in your under
[2:02:41] your
[2:02:42] jurisdiction circumcised them if
[2:02:44] somebody's not
[2:02:46] circumcised kill him so if you get to
[2:02:50] Abraham temp everybody is
[2:02:53] circumcised but if you notice
[2:02:57] circumcision is not a public
[2:03:00] sign it is a sign that is private it is
[2:03:04] a sign that is
[2:03:06] covered it is a son that is
[2:03:09] protected only the one who
[2:03:12] has knows the secret between him and God
[2:03:18] that's the reason why when Israel fight
[2:03:21] with
[2:03:23] if they don't they have not remembered
[2:03:25] that
[2:03:26] yet they will fight with you as normal
[2:03:30] man but if ever during the
[2:03:33] fight a man of Israel
[2:03:37] remember that within my
[2:03:40] clothing I carry a
[2:03:43] Mark that is different then the one who
[2:03:47] is fighting
[2:03:48] against the battle change
[2:03:51] is no longer his battle he become the
[2:03:55] Battle of God God enter into the battle
[2:03:59] and change the battle that's the reason
[2:04:01] why when David was talking to Goliath
[2:04:05] David remember something David when he
[2:04:08] read go talking he said wait a minute
[2:04:12] who is this
[2:04:15] uncircumcised didn't take the the
[2:04:17] clothing of gol verify
[2:04:22] was
[2:04:23] ccum but because gol was coming from a
[2:04:26] different Nation say who is this
[2:04:30] when David spoke that his height was
[2:04:34] no longer a problem his muscle was no
[2:04:37] longer a problem his strength was no
[2:04:40] longer a problem the god of Israel enter
[2:04:44] into the seene and took a stone and
[2:04:47] brought Goliath down why because of a
[2:04:51] mark
[2:04:52] of Distinction a mark of
[2:04:55] circumcision so everyone who is in the
[2:04:59] house of Israel must be circumcised if
[2:05:03] you are not circumcised they kill you
[2:05:07] now that concept of
[2:05:10] circumcision remove will leave the
[2:05:13] Jewish
[2:05:14] people because the world become
[2:05:18] evangelized so we accepting God
[2:05:22] through the Jewish Channel we also took
[2:05:25] the sign of
[2:05:27] circum now everybody is
[2:05:29] circumcised if you have a male child and
[2:05:33] he's born in a hospital usually before
[2:05:36] he leave the hospital they already
[2:05:38] circumcised but even though they
[2:05:40] circumcise you are you a Jew you're not
[2:05:44] a Jew so now the mark now is no longer
[2:05:48] of a value back in the day he was a
[2:05:52] but now everybody is circumcised so
[2:05:56] who's Jew who's not Jew but what was the
[2:05:59] purpose of that
[2:06:01] Mark and what was the
[2:06:03] mystery behind
[2:06:06] circumcision circumcision means a man is
[2:06:11] born with excess
[2:06:14] flesh then he
[2:06:16] needed so God told Abraham go ahead and
[2:06:21] cut that
[2:06:22] excess and remove it so there is a part
[2:06:26] of you that you were carrying that was
[2:06:30] not supposed to stay with you and
[2:06:33] through
[2:06:34] circumcision that part is removed and
[2:06:37] once it's removed you and God become
[2:06:42] friend so what is that Mark
[2:06:45] for we are
[2:06:48] women so brother Steven
[2:06:51] ision was only for men what about so we
[2:06:55] were put out let's go to
[2:06:58] theonomy chapter 10 if you dare you can
[2:07:01] say amen amen glory to God Deuteronomy
[2:07:05] 10
[2:07:07] verse2 amen amen and now yeah Lord I
[2:07:11] hear so many amen now so the ice is
[2:07:16] broken now we are
[2:07:18] fine uh Deuteronomy 10:2
[2:07:22] now
[2:07:24] Israel what do the
[2:07:27] Lord uh verse uh Deuteronomy 10:12 and
[2:07:33] now Israel is what do the Lord thy God
[2:07:36] require of
[2:07:37] [Music]
[2:07:39] thee but to fear the lord th
[2:07:42] God to walk in all his ways and to love
[2:07:46] him and to serve the Lord th God with
[2:07:50] all thy heart and with all th soul to
[2:07:54] keep the Commandment of the
[2:07:56] Lord statute which are commanded this
[2:08:00] day for th
[2:08:02] good behold the Heaven and the heaven of
[2:08:07] Heavens is the Lord th God and the Earth
[2:08:11] also with all therein is only the Lord
[2:08:16] has a
[2:08:18] delight in their fathers to love them
[2:08:23] and he chose their seed after them even
[2:08:27] you above all
[2:08:29] people as it is this day this is
[2:08:34] self-explanatory God is telling you he
[2:08:37] wants you to love him follow the
[2:08:39] Commandment do what he want everybody
[2:08:42] knows this because when we children we
[2:08:45] are taught this by our parents but where
[2:08:48] are we going with this
[2:08:50] circumcision J to verse
[2:08:53] 16 God says circumcise
[2:08:59] therefore the for skin of your
[2:09:03] heart and be no more stiff
[2:09:08] neck I thought
[2:09:11] circumcision was somewhere for
[2:09:14] men and women were not
[2:09:17] circumstan now God in
[2:09:20] Deuteronomy speak to Israel Israel
[2:09:23] doesn't listen God will rescue Israel
[2:09:26] Israel will go back to bad things God
[2:09:29] will send a prophet rescue Israel Israel
[2:09:33] does something wrong when God look he
[2:09:36] say what is wrong with these people
[2:09:39] because it looks like since the fall men
[2:09:43] have
[2:09:44] difficulty
[2:09:46] keeping the Commandment of God he will
[2:09:49] start good then later on he fall he will
[2:09:53] start good and later on he fall so when
[2:09:56] God begin to examine the
[2:09:59] situation God say wait a minute the
[2:10:04] Surplus the
[2:10:05] excess of the flesh that I told Abraham
[2:10:10] was
[2:10:11] only a
[2:10:14] picture the true problem is not that
[2:10:18] because we begin to see Jews even though
[2:10:21] they
[2:10:22] circumcised but they do bad stuff so God
[2:10:26] say hey so now you begin to play with
[2:10:30] circumcision what I gave Abraham was
[2:10:33] only a a shadow I was only trying to
[2:10:37] tell him something but the true problem
[2:10:41] is not really in your flesh you can cut
[2:10:44] a part of your flesh you can lose an arm
[2:10:49] and you still
[2:10:50] bad lose a finger and you still bad you
[2:10:54] can get in an accident and when you come
[2:10:57] out from the accident and people think
[2:10:59] okay after the accident he's going to
[2:11:01] change he's still bad when we had Co
[2:11:06] everybody run to church because of Co
[2:11:10] when vaccine and Co came and then
[2:11:13] everybody begin to feel better everybody
[2:11:15] went back drinking and doing everything
[2:11:18] so God look he said the problem is not
[2:11:20] really the
[2:11:22] flesh the problem is in the
[2:11:25] heart and God say Israel I want you to
[2:11:29] be
[2:11:31] circumcised Not In the Flesh in the
[2:11:34] heart but when it comes to the heart not
[2:11:38] only men have
[2:11:39] heart women have
[2:11:42] heart the
[2:11:43] circumcision is not only to men now the
[2:11:47] circumcision is both to men and to women
[2:11:51] but brother
[2:11:53] Steven
[2:11:55] circumcision is taking somebody and
[2:11:59] cutting the
[2:12:00] flesh now God is saying let's go in the
[2:12:04] heart and circumcise the heart so
[2:12:07] everybody need to have a heart surgery
[2:12:10] so we need to go to the
[2:12:12] cardiologist so that everybody will have
[2:12:14] an open heart cut and then when you cut
[2:12:17] a portion of your heart you say okay now
[2:12:20] I'm a Christian
[2:12:21] there are people who had a heart surgery
[2:12:24] and they still bad there are people who
[2:12:27] have heart transplant and they still bad
[2:12:30] so it is not a physical
[2:12:33] heart God is talking about something
[2:12:35] else the heart in the scripture speak
[2:12:39] about the
[2:12:40] soul it is the soul of man in other
[2:12:44] words your soul is where the problem
[2:12:47] is because when you die your heart goes
[2:12:52] in the
[2:12:53] grave and your heart will rot so the
[2:12:57] problem is not the organ of the heart
[2:13:00] but it's the man that Liv in the
[2:13:02] heart you is in your heart when you do
[2:13:06] something wrong you somebody in your
[2:13:09] heart is not when you lie to somebody
[2:13:13] even though they ask you tell the truth
[2:13:16] say I didn't do it but somebody there
[2:13:18] knows it that's the problem that's the
[2:13:21] you that cause problem that's the
[2:13:24] problem that's the man that is there the
[2:13:27] woman that is there that woman need the
[2:13:31] circumcision not the woman that I see
[2:13:33] here but the Invisible Woman The
[2:13:36] Invisible Man that is inside the man is
[2:13:40] the one that need the
[2:13:41] circumcision that is what God is saying
[2:13:44] catch your heart go ahead and circumcise
[2:13:48] the heart if God
[2:13:51] circumcise the heart to remove something
[2:13:55] bad it means that the heart of a man
[2:13:59] have a
[2:14:01] problem why the heart I thought I have a
[2:14:04] good
[2:14:05] heart let's go to Mark chapter
[2:14:10] 7 glory to
[2:14:12] God where I will stop your pastor will
[2:14:15] pick
[2:14:17] up amen Mark chapter 7
[2:14:21] Mark if you dare you can say
[2:14:24] Amen Mark 7
[2:14:27] verse
[2:14:31] 14 amen amen this is Jesus this is the
[2:14:36] Bible says and when he had
[2:14:39] called all the people unto him he said
[2:14:43] unto them hearken unto me every one of
[2:14:48] you and understand God call people when
[2:14:52] the people came God say all of you pay
[2:14:56] attention to what I'm going to say so we
[2:14:59] to we also here we need to pay attention
[2:15:02] to what Jesus is saying because Jesus is
[2:15:05] God he is the big Prophet we want to
[2:15:08] hear what God want to talk verse
[2:15:11] 15 there is
[2:15:15] nothing from without a man that entering
[2:15:19] into him can defile
[2:15:22] him Jesus is saying the mcdonal that you
[2:15:27] eat the wend this that you eat the pizza
[2:15:31] that you eat you can eat it all you want
[2:15:35] if you eat pizza he won't make you a bad
[2:15:38] man he won't make you a bad woman if
[2:15:42] it's a wrong Pizza you can have
[2:15:44] sickness but it won't make you a bad
[2:15:47] woman it is not because you eat
[2:15:49] hamburger then you became bad so Jesus
[2:15:53] is saying it is not what is entering in
[2:15:57] that make you bad are we together oh God
[2:16:02] I have to go like this so this will
[2:16:05] penetrate
[2:16:06] you and when God comes God can enter
[2:16:10] into you easily without any more problem
[2:16:14] are we together very much he says there
[2:16:17] is nothing from without
[2:16:19] amen entering in him can defile him but
[2:16:24] the think which come out
[2:16:27] of oh let me ask you a
[2:16:33] question you all sitting
[2:16:36] here did anybody vomit
[2:16:39] here did you anybody vomit
[2:16:43] yesterday so what did come out of
[2:16:46] you
[2:16:48] Sala so if you spit you become bad
[2:16:52] so what is really coming out of
[2:16:56] you
[2:16:59] usually it's
[2:17:01] word right if you
[2:17:04] say
[2:17:06] brother uh Jo you a good man brother say
[2:17:11] thank you very much brother
[2:17:13] St if I cast which I won't do
[2:17:18] it then brother Joe will say
[2:17:22] that's a bad man and usually we say
[2:17:24] that's a
[2:17:25] sinner so we recognize
[2:17:28] Sinners based on what is coming out of
[2:17:31] so what come out of a man it many it is
[2:17:36] not food food goes differently but what
[2:17:39] is coming out of man is something
[2:17:42] continue the scripture verse
[2:17:44] 16 Jesus is saying what enter into you
[2:17:49] don't defy you never
[2:17:52] but what makes you dirty bad before God
[2:17:56] is what is coming
[2:18:00] from so there is something in me that
[2:18:04] produce something and when I produce it
[2:18:08] I become filthy before God we need to
[2:18:11] know where is that
[2:18:14] generator where is the engine where is
[2:18:18] that
[2:18:19] manufacturer that manufactur your bad
[2:18:21] stuff and when those bad stuff come from
[2:18:24] you it makes you bad because if you know
[2:18:28] the manfacturer then you can go there to
[2:18:31] fix it are we together if you don't know
[2:18:34] if your car is broken and the mechanic
[2:18:37] doesn't know what is wrong with the
[2:18:39] car when you go to the dealer and they
[2:18:42] need to take a machine and hook it you
[2:18:45] know you've been to the dealer and the
[2:18:46] Machine will tell them it's something
[2:18:48] there and then they know what is the
[2:18:50] problem so let's also hook our spiritual
[2:18:54] machine from the dealer toight and let's
[2:18:57] see what is that
[2:19:00] machine that
[2:19:01] manufacture that is making you
[2:19:05] bad verse
[2:19:07] 16 the Bible says if any man have ears
[2:19:13] to hear Let Him hear so some people have
[2:19:17] ears but they don't hear
[2:19:21] let's leave it alone okay verse 17 and
[2:19:25] when he was entered into the
[2:19:27] house from the people his disciple asked
[2:19:31] him concerning the parable so Jesus told
[2:19:34] everybody and he left them so when he
[2:19:37] went in private the disciples
[2:19:40] say come on Jesus you speaking in
[2:19:44] Parable we didn't understand what you
[2:19:46] mean you say what enter into us don't
[2:19:49] make us bad what is coming out so what
[2:19:52] do you mean h okay those are I mean
[2:19:56] people from outside we are your
[2:19:59] body explain us we want to
[2:20:02] understand now Jesus will explain to us
[2:20:05] what he
[2:20:07] spoke the Bible says in verse 18 and he
[2:20:11] say unto them are ye so without
[2:20:16] understanding in other way you also
[2:20:18] don't understand just like them
[2:20:21] do ye not perceive that whatsoever thing
[2:20:25] from
[2:20:26] without enter into a man he cannot
[2:20:29] defile him in other word don't you
[2:20:32] understand that what you eat don't make
[2:20:33] you
[2:20:35] bad he says because he entered not into
[2:20:39] his
[2:20:42] heart so when you take a hamburger and
[2:20:44] you eat your hamburger don't go in your
[2:20:48] heart your hamburger goes in your
[2:20:50] stomach
[2:20:52] so Jesus is saying what you eat goes in
[2:20:54] the stomach so what you eat doesn't
[2:20:58] affect your problem remember
[2:21:01] circumcision must be in the heart now we
[2:21:04] together are we together he says
[2:21:07] whatever you eat doesn't go into the
[2:21:11] heart but into the
[2:21:13] belly goth into the
[2:21:16] drought purging all meat in other words
[2:21:19] it goes into the bathroom
[2:21:21] and verse 20 and he say thou which
[2:21:25] cometh out of the
[2:21:27] man that defile the man what comes out
[2:21:31] of you this is what makes you bad verse
[2:21:35] 20 we there and he said thou which
[2:21:40] cometh out of a man that def the man
[2:21:43] verse 21 for from
[2:21:48] within out of the heart everybody
[2:21:51] clear of
[2:21:53] man proceed evil
[2:21:57] thoughts bad thought don't come from
[2:22:00] your belly it's coming from your heart
[2:22:04] I'm reading to you the Bible don't say
[2:22:05] brother
[2:22:10] St
[2:22:12] adulteries come from where the
[2:22:15] heart that's why Jesus say whoever look
[2:22:19] on a woman
[2:22:21] you know the scripture and last after
[2:22:23] her has committed adultery
[2:22:27] where before somebody committed adultery
[2:22:30] like this he already started in the
[2:22:34] heart before somebody go to steal he
[2:22:38] already stole in the heart because you
[2:22:40] got to make plan how to steal and then
[2:22:44] you execute your plan so the problem
[2:22:47] start in the heart are we together evil
[2:22:50] thought heart
[2:22:53] adultery come on
[2:22:56] fornication which means having sex
[2:22:59] before
[2:23:00] marriage adultery means you have sex
[2:23:04] outside of marriage you are married man
[2:23:07] and you go have sex with somebody else
[2:23:10] or you a married woman you go have sex
[2:23:12] with somebody else that is adultery it
[2:23:15] start from your heart fornication means
[2:23:18] you are not married whether you woman or
[2:23:21] a man and you because you in college you
[2:23:24] start having sex that sin before God
[2:23:28] that stuff started in your
[2:23:30] heart we
[2:23:33] together come on murder start where So
[2:23:37] when you say I'm going to kill that man
[2:23:41] you already killed
[2:23:43] him in the Heart come verse 22 F I just
[2:23:48] told
[2:23:49] you in the heart heart covetousness
[2:23:52] where in the heart wickedness where in
[2:23:56] the heart deceit
[2:23:59] Las an evil
[2:24:02] eye so before your eye become
[2:24:05] bad started in the heart because you
[2:24:08] must be angry and then your eyes
[2:24:11] change so the bad eye didn't start like
[2:24:14] this it was first in the heart that's
[2:24:17] why you must cumc
[2:24:22] heart
[2:24:23] Hallelujah
[2:24:25] come
[2:24:27] blasphemy in the
[2:24:29] heart
[2:24:31] pride in the heart I'm going to wear
[2:24:34] that skirt and show them and post it on
[2:24:37] WhatsApp so everybody can see from the
[2:24:41] heart I buy a new car post it on
[2:24:44] WhatsApp from the heart I bought a new
[2:24:47] house from the heart I dress on Sunday I
[2:24:51] have to post it on WhatsApp on Instagram
[2:24:55] from the heart Pride from the heart I
[2:24:59] hope I'm whooping somebody
[2:25:02] tonight glory to God
[2:25:05] foolishness from the heart verse 23 all
[2:25:10] these evil things come from
[2:25:19] within that's why God say You must be
[2:25:25] circumcised from the heart the mark of
[2:25:29] Distinction that I'm looking for it is
[2:25:32] not in the flesh I want to see the
[2:25:35] distinction from your heart because once
[2:25:38] that bad part of you that is the
[2:25:42] generator of all the bad stuff it's cut
[2:25:46] from you and remove everything is good
[2:25:51] I'm sorry I have to use this
[2:25:53] example if you have a
[2:25:56] to you go see the
[2:25:59] dentist and when you get there what do
[2:26:01] you tell the dentist if you didn't sleep
[2:26:03] for three
[2:26:04] days what do you usually tell the
[2:26:06] dentist take the tooth out remove the
[2:26:09] tooth it was your tooth but you say I
[2:26:12] can't sleep please remove the to even if
[2:26:15] the D say we can save it you say no no
[2:26:17] no no just take the too he used to be
[2:26:20] your too but because he begin to cause
[2:26:22] you problem the dentist have to take the
[2:26:24] tooth out when they take the tooth out
[2:26:28] the infection that was in the tooth goes
[2:26:30] also out and you get healed and
[2:26:33] everything come back to peace and there
[2:26:36] is a part of you that is causing you
[2:26:38] trouble and God say it is time that we
[2:26:42] need to cut that just like the dentist
[2:26:45] we move the we need to cut that part and
[2:26:49] throw that part away so that all the bad
[2:26:51] stuff won be coming out of you and then
[2:26:55] in that heart we will put the Holy Ghost
[2:26:58] and when we put the Holy Ghost now from

[2:29:29] note let's go to Jeremiah 6 now verse 10
[2:29:34] if you dare you can say
[2:29:36] Amen now Jeremiah say the same Prophet
[2:29:39] who say circumcise your
[2:29:41] heart now he's saying To Whom Shall I
[2:29:46] speak and give
[2:29:48] warning that they may hear
[2:29:51] now God is saying I'm talking it seems
[2:29:54] like they don't listen I'm talking they
[2:29:56] don't hear just like parent you tell a
[2:29:59] child they don't listen God say I'm
[2:30:01] talking they don't hear the problem was
[2:30:04] the heart I'm talking they don't listen
[2:30:07] so what is it the problem to this kids
[2:30:09] are you there let's read he says that's
[2:30:14] he said To Whom Shall I speak and give
[2:30:17] warning that they may hear be
[2:30:20] behold their
[2:30:23] what their
[2:30:25] ear is what
[2:30:29] circum so we got another
[2:30:33] part of the body that is not
[2:30:38] circumcised remember circumcision means
[2:30:41] cut the
[2:30:42] flesh brother Steven so we go to the
[2:30:45] doctor we cut our
[2:30:46] ears that's not what we speaking it's a
[2:30:50] ear now the
[2:30:53] ear must be circumcised in other
[2:30:57] word there is a part of your
[2:31:01] hearing that is
[2:31:03] problem why the heart bad things start
[2:31:07] from the
[2:31:08] heart amen why they here the Bible says
[2:31:14] behold their ear is
[2:31:15] uncircumcised and they cannot
[2:31:18] hearken the word god say ah the reason
[2:31:21] why they don't he there is something
[2:31:24] going on their ears is
[2:31:27] blocked that's the reason why you can
[2:31:30] holler they don't want to listen they
[2:31:32] preach can preach and preach preach and
[2:31:35] sweat they don't listen they have a
[2:31:37] problem in the ear not the natural but a
[2:31:40] spiritual ear because remember Jesus
[2:31:43] said to whom
[2:31:47] have are we there and then he says they
[2:31:51] cannot hearken the word of the Lord is
[2:31:55] unto them a reproach and they have no
[2:31:58] Delight in
[2:32:01] it now now put your seat belt and follow
[2:32:04] me
[2:32:05] carefully God is saying the problem is
[2:32:08] in the heart remove a bad heart and then
[2:32:12] the spirit of the Lord will come because
[2:32:15] you need to know when the Holy Ghost
[2:32:17] come where is he going because we see
[2:32:21] all kind of
[2:32:22] nonsense in a religious World they give
[2:32:26] somebody like this they touch somebody
[2:32:28] they fall on the ground so when they
[2:32:30] fall they W up they still bad people so

[2:32:36] we want to have a good Holy Ghost but
[2:32:38] when he enter and we change and the Holy
[2:32:42] Ghost need to go where the problem is
[2:32:45] and the first problem is in the heart
[2:32:48] and God is is is again bringing another
[2:32:51] part he said the ears have a
[2:32:53] problem what is wrong with the ear why
[2:32:56] is the ear
[2:32:59] important for the Holy Ghost brother
[2:33:02] Sten I thought the heart is enough now

[2:36:13] prophets and now from the prophet we
[2:36:15] move to the
[2:36:16] heart and we seen that the problem is
[2:36:19] the heart of a man the heart of a man
[2:36:22] need to be
[2:36:23] changed are we
[2:36:25] together let's go to Mal chapter

[2:37:01] what we know what happened
[2:37:03] in God to speak to you he must send you
[2:37:06] a
[2:37:07] prophet are we together God say remember
[2:37:11] that to all for all
[2:37:14] Israel with the statute and
[2:37:16] judgment behold I will send you Elijah
[2:37:21] the
[2:37:23] prophet before the great and Dreadful
[2:37:26] day of the
[2:37:28] Lord and He
[2:37:30] Elijah shall turn the
[2:37:33] heart of the father to the children and
[2:37:38] the Heart of the children to the
[2:37:42] father come and smite the Earth with the
[2:37:46] curse if you notice God is saying
[2:37:49] according to the law
[2:37:51] of I'm going to send you Elijah the
[2:37:54] Prophet Elijah the prophet have one
[2:37:59] target he only have one place he will
[2:38:04] turn the heart why the heart because the
[2:38:09] heart is where everything is
[2:38:11] coming and God say before I change the
[2:38:14] heart I must send you
[2:38:17] Elijah so with Elijah
[2:38:20] no
[2:38:21] circumcision relax my
[2:38:25] friend relax my
[2:38:27] friend I just read to you is my Bible
[2:38:32] different than your
[2:38:34] Bible is my Bible different than your
[2:38:36] Bible we have the same Bible the Bible
[2:38:39] say according to I use prophet and I'm
[2:38:44] going to use a prophet call
[2:38:46] Elijah Elijah in the Bible sometime they
[2:38:50] call him
[2:38:51] Elijah in the New Testament they call
[2:38:53] him Elias for those who know that it's
[2:38:56] the same man like monana it's the same
[2:39:00] man and they say I'm going to send you
[2:39:02] Elijah and God say when I send you
[2:39:04] Elijah Elijah have one
[2:39:07] target he's targeting the heart because
[2:39:11] the heart is where the problem
[2:39:13] is but the Bible is saying something
[2:39:16] very
[2:39:17] specific the Bible say when Elijah
[2:39:21] come he will take the heart of the
[2:39:24] children of the father
[2:39:27] first can I erase
[2:39:29] this he say Elijah when he
[2:39:33] come he will take the heart of the
[2:39:39] father and turn it to the
[2:39:43] children are we together and he will
[2:39:47] also take the heart of the children
[2:39:51] and turn it toward the
[2:39:54] father so when we look at
[2:39:59] this Elijah must
[2:40:01] come because we got a problem in our
[2:40:04] heart Elijah come our heart are Sav
[2:40:08] because God gave us the
[2:40:10] formula God gave us the solution he say

[2:41:09] solution God give the
[2:41:12] medication give the
[2:41:14] prescription he said this is the
[2:41:17] prescription they you for for you to
[2:41:20] know that the time have come that I'm
[2:41:24] coming to deal with the problem of
[2:41:27] humanity you will see
[2:41:30] Elijah when Elijah come on the that elij
[2:41:35] must be a prophet according to the law
[2:41:39] ofb because according Tob must send you
[2:41:44] a Prophet by the name of Elijah and when

[2:41:51] things yes sir are we together he must
[2:41:55] turn the heart of the father to the
[2:41:58] children and the Heart of the children
[2:42:01] to the father are we together so now we
[2:42:04] need to find who is our
[2:42:07] Elijah remember the
[2:42:11] law and the prophet where until who
[2:42:16] until John remember
[2:42:19] and the prophet were until who why
[2:42:26] John I got
[2:42:30] excited I'm in a
[2:42:33] conference why
[2:42:35] John let's go to the Book of Luke
[2:42:41] Luke Oh Glory to
[2:42:45] God let's go to the Book of Luke
[2:42:50] Hallelujah Luke chapter 1
[2:42:54] Luke Luke chapter
[2:42:58] 1 if you dare you can say amen
[2:43:02] amen verse five I need to give you a
[2:43:05] background here the Bible say there was
[2:43:10] in the days of Herod the king of Judah a
[2:43:14] certain priest named zaras of the course
[2:43:18] of ab
[2:43:19] and his wife was of the daughters of
[2:43:22] Aaron and her name was
[2:43:25] elizabethe so how many knows this story
[2:43:28] I can
[2:43:30] save if I don't see your hand raised so
[2:43:32] I know you don't know I will continue
[2:43:35] reading okay some hands are not so let's
[2:43:39] read Because if I continue I don't want
[2:43:41] to lose
[2:43:42] you verse uh six and they were both
[2:43:46] righteous before God walking in all the
[2:43:50] Commandments and ordinances of the Lord
[2:43:54] blameless and they had no child because
[2:43:58] that Elizabeth was buried and they both
[2:44:01] were now well stricken in
[2:44:03] years and he came to pass that while he
[2:44:07] executed the priest
[2:44:09] office before God in the order of his
[2:44:13] court according to the custom of the
[2:44:15] priest
[2:44:16] office his lot was to burn
[2:44:21] ense when he went into the Temple of the
[2:44:24] Lord job to verse 11 and there appear
[2:44:28] unto him unto
[2:44:31] Zachariah an angel of the Lord standing
[2:44:34] on the right side of the Altar
[2:44:36] offens and when Zariah saw him he was
[2:44:40] troubled and fear fell upon him but the
[2:44:44] angel said to him fear not Zari for that
[2:44:48] prayer is heard
[2:44:49] and that wife elizabethe shall bear a
[2:44:52] son and that shall call his name
[2:44:56] who
[2:44:58] John so we see the story of John bar
[2:45:02] they were
[2:45:03] Barren an angel appear and say God heard
[2:45:07] your prayer you're going to have a child
[2:45:09] and the child his name is who John the
[2:45:12] law and the prophet were until who
[2:45:17] John all right who is this
[2:45:21] John what is he trying to
[2:45:24] do all let's go verse
[2:45:28] 14 and thou shall have
[2:45:31] joy and gladness and many shall rejoice
[2:45:35] at his
[2:45:38] birth for he shall be great in the sight
[2:45:42] of the Lord and shall drink neither wine
[2:45:46] nor strong drink
[2:45:49] shall be
[2:45:51] filled with the Holy Ghost even from
[2:45:55] what his mother's
[2:45:58] womb this
[2:46:02] childn from his mother's womb the holy
[2:46:05] spirit is already working
[2:46:09] there but brother Steven you told me
[2:46:13] about Elijah and you told me that Elijah
[2:46:17] would take the heart of the children to
[2:46:19] the Father the father now you left
[2:46:22] Elijah you drop Elijah you are now in
[2:46:25] John what has John have to do
[2:46:29] with because we need to
[2:46:31] know the solution for our
[2:46:34] heart what is going on verse uh
[2:46:38] 16 follow me carefully you there you
[2:46:43] there you there and many of the children
[2:46:48] M of of
[2:46:50] Israel shall he
[2:46:52] turn to the
[2:46:55] Lord there
[2:46:59] God the
[2:47:00] mission of this
[2:47:03] Elijah is
[2:47:05] strange amen he's going to take the
[2:47:09] children and turn them to the
[2:47:12] Lord are we together but remember here
[2:47:16] Jesus is not born yet because John was
[2:47:19] olded than Jesus because when Jesus came
[2:47:23] Jesus came as a
[2:47:25] child and the Bible say this John he
[2:47:30] will take
[2:47:32] the the heart of the father and turn
[2:47:35] them to the child h brother Steven the
[2:47:39] Bible didn't say that the Bible say he
[2:47:42] would take many and turn to the Lord now
[2:47:46] you begin to
[2:47:47] interpret where did the the Bible say he
[2:47:49] would take the heart of the children to
[2:47:51] the father you T us at the beginning
[2:47:54] here do not interpret the word we want
[2:47:57] to see it from the Bible where he says
[2:48:00] the heart and then we will receive it
[2:48:04] thank you very much dear and let me give
[2:48:06] you the
[2:48:07] scripture let's go to the next verse
[2:48:11] verse
[2:48:12] 17 and he John shall go before him in
[2:48:18] the SP
[2:48:20] and the power of who El Elijah so Elijah
[2:48:26] now have changed
[2:48:29] name yes sir so if you looking for a man
[2:48:33] called Elijah el el you won't find
[2:48:39] him the spirit is Elijah but the name is
[2:48:43] John so Elijah doesn't mean his name
[2:48:48] must be El
[2:48:50] are we together are we together if I
[2:48:53] lost you raise your hand so I
[2:48:58] rep thank you all right the Bible say
[2:49:02] and he John the Baptist shall go before
[2:49:05] him in the spirit and the power of
[2:49:09] Elijah to
[2:49:11] turn the heart of the father to the
[2:49:16] children and the disobedience
[2:49:19] to the wisdom of the just and to make
[2:49:22] ready a people prepare for the Lord now
[2:49:25] we have discovered our Elijah our Elijah
[2:49:29] that was prophesied by
[2:49:31] Malachi his name is John that's why
[2:49:35] Jesus said the
[2:49:37] law the law and the prophet where until
[2:49:42] John because John is the is the result
[2:49:49] medication that we were looking for but
[2:49:52] there is a problem here when we read the
[2:49:55] Bible the bible say that John the
[2:49:59] Baptist who is the
[2:50:01] Elijah will turn the heart of the
[2:50:05] children of the father to the children
[2:50:09] but I don't see
[2:50:10] here where the bible say that John the
[2:50:14] Baptist will take the heart of the
[2:50:16] children to the father in other words
[2:50:20] Luke who was writing the Bible took the
[2:50:25] scripture of malach and
[2:50:34] in so now we got this
[2:50:38] Malachi in two scriptures what did John
[2:50:42] fulfill John
[2:50:44] fulfill the part the first part and the
[2:50:48] second part now John fulfill taking the
[2:50:53] father to the children that's
[2:50:58] say but Malachi say Elijah
[2:51:02] come he will turn the heart of the
[2:51:05] father to the children and the children
[2:51:09] to the father now we see an Elijah who's
[2:51:13] fulfilling the first one now where is
[2:51:15] our next Elijah
[2:51:18] I leave it to your
[2:51:20] pastor are we together are we together
[2:51:24] are we together now joh fulfill only a
[2:51:31] portion of the
[2:51:33] scripture get the father remember God
[2:51:38] who in
[2:51:39] San spoke to Our
[2:51:42] Father by the prophet John take the
[2:51:46] father and he bre to bring the father to
[2:51:49] the
[2:51:50] children amen remember Jesus when he
[2:51:54] look at older
[2:51:55] people and he said bring me that baby
[2:51:58] there bring me that child there and he
[2:52:01] put the child and Jesus say if all of
[2:52:05] you are not
[2:52:07] like they taking adult and they're
[2:52:10] bringing adult to to the faith of
[2:52:13] children it happened through John the
[2:52:16] Baptist but this part not happening in
[2:52:20] other
[2:52:21] word there must be a
[2:52:25] again who must be taking the heart of
[2:52:28] the
[2:52:29] children bringing them to the father
[2:52:32] because we need this to Elijah because
[2:52:35] the solution of our heart lays within
[2:52:38] this elah if you find this Elijah you
[2:52:42] find the
[2:52:43] Cure now let's go to John the Baptist
[2:52:47] let's ask John
[2:52:49] Baptist now you are Elijah and God told
[2:52:52] us in the Old Testament when we find you
[2:52:56] you will change our heart so we need to
[2:52:58] know what is the solution how do we
[2:53:02] circumcise the
[2:53:05] Heart John the Baptist tell me what is
[2:53:10] the
[2:53:10] formula are we together John tell me
[2:53:15] let's go to Luke three we were in Luke
[2:53:17] one
[2:53:19] Luke lukee 3 l verse1 15 if you dare you
[2:53:23] can say
[2:53:24] Amen Oh Glory to God Luke 3:15 you
[2:53:30] there the Bible says and as the people
[2:53:33] were in
[2:53:35] expectation and all men mused in their
[2:53:40] heart of who John whether he were the
[2:53:45] chist or not so when John the bapti
[2:53:49] came he came with a powerful
[2:53:52] Ministry every Juda
[2:53:54] moved so everybody begin to look at John
[2:53:58] they say but Moses told us God will send
[2:54:02] us the Messiah God will send us Christ
[2:54:05] Christ will come maybe John John must be
[2:54:09] the Christ because the way he
[2:54:12] preaches it should be him but the Bible
[2:54:15] didn't say that John is the Crist
[2:54:18] say that John is
[2:54:20] Elijah if he's Elijah he got the
[2:54:25] secret of the
[2:54:27] heart so the people went they say John
[2:54:32] you trouble us too
[2:54:34] much tell us the secret because God says
[2:54:38] circumcise the heart what will we do the
[2:54:41] Bible says this glory to God verse 16
[2:54:45] John answered saying unto them
[2:54:49] all I indeed baptize with
[2:54:55] what but
[2:54:58] one M than
[2:55:01] I come the L of who shoes I am not
[2:55:06] worthy to un
[2:55:09] lose shall
[2:55:11] baptize with the Holy Ghost and with
[2:55:16] what now we find the
[2:55:18] solution in other words John is a
[2:55:24] billboard John is a s post when you get
[2:55:29] to John you find the right
[2:55:32] exit John will uce you to the solution
[2:55:36] of the holy spirit so when you arrive to
[2:55:39] John you on the right position that's
[2:55:42] why you must always find John because
[2:55:46] John is the perfect
[2:55:48] GPS to the solution of the heart and if
[2:55:52] you find the first John the first John
[2:55:55] introduce Christ so if there is
[2:55:59] another that have to come we need to
[2:56:02] find that because if you find that El
[2:56:06] you will find the second part of the
[2:56:10] solution of the
[2:56:13] heart
[2:56:16] amen yes sir
[2:56:18] are we together are we together are we
[2:56:22] together are we
[2:56:25] together John say it is not me it is
[2:56:29] Christ go to Christ if you want the Holy
[2:56:33] Ghost because I know your problem your
[2:56:36] problem is the heart your heart need to
[2:56:38] be circumcised and the solution to the
[2:56:41] circum must have the Holy Ghost the Holy
[2:56:45] Ghost and Fire
[2:56:48] so when the Holy Ghost come a fire must
[2:56:52] burn that evil person
[2:56:56] of that that that bad excess portion of
[2:57:00] you must be
[2:57:07] crated I will send you
[2:57:10] Elijah to turn the
[2:57:12] heart we found our first
[2:57:15] Elijah Elijah where is the solution he
[2:57:18] say you came to the right place but I'm
[2:57:20] not the solution the solution is Christ
[2:57:24] when he cometh I cannot even touch his
[2:57:28] shoes he will baptize you with the Holy
[2:57:31] Ghost and with fire in other way the
[2:57:34] solution that you're looking for only
[2:57:37] God can do it the same God that could
[2:57:42] remove the spirit from Moses and put it
[2:57:45] in someone else is the same God that
[2:57:48] take the spirit that was in Christ and
[2:57:50] put it also in you so that your heart
[2:57:52] can be circumcised and now you will
[2:57:55] become pleasing unto the Lord let me
[2:57:58] wind up because my signal came oh God
[2:58:02] Amen I'm sorry we cannot get into what
[2:58:04] is that Holy
[2:58:07] Ghost glory to God
[2:58:09] amen amen amen amen glory to God GL Oh
[2:58:15] Glory to God we are on luk chapter uh 3
[2:58:20] let's go to John 7 and then I'm going to
[2:58:23] nail here John John chapter 7
[2:58:27] joh John the Baptist Tau us the
[2:58:31] solution the solution is who go to
[2:58:34] Jesus that's why the law Jesus said the
[2:58:37] law and the prophet were until
[2:58:42] John we clear now we came to John John
[2:58:45] the Bap say go see Jesus now me and you
[2:58:50] we need to walk to Jesus and we need to
[2:58:52] talk to Jesus to give us the solution
[2:58:55] John chapter
[2:58:57] 7 if you thereare you can say Amen John
[2:59:01] 737 in the last day that great day of
[2:59:06] the
[2:59:08] Feast of the feast Jesus stood and cry
[2:59:14] saying if any man thirst remember
[2:59:19] Isaiah God will pour out the water on
[2:59:23] the one who
[2:59:25] T If any man
[2:59:28] thirst let him do
[2:59:31] what now Isaiah
[2:59:34] say if you thirst God will do what P
[2:59:38] Water now Jesus is saying if you T come
[2:59:43] to me in other words what Isaiah was
[2:59:45] speaking right here
[2:59:48] yes
[2:59:49] sir come unto
[2:59:52] me and
[2:59:55] drink so when you get to Jesus Christ
[2:59:59] that's where the water
[3:00:01] is to drink verse 38 he that believeth
[3:00:07] on
[3:00:08] me as the scripture have said there is a
[3:00:12] key there believeth but I can't get into
[3:00:15] that he that believeth on him
[3:00:18] on me as the scripture have
[3:00:21] said out of his belly not to the stomach
[3:00:24] now that was the heart out of his belly
[3:00:28] shall flow rivers of Living
[3:00:33] Water in other word when Jesus come and
[3:00:37] you drink from him you become also a
[3:00:42] source from you begin to come also water
[3:00:48] so the Holy Ghost in you can move to
[3:00:50] another
[3:00:51] person Oh Glory to God verse
[3:00:55] 39 but what is Jesus talking about but
[3:01:00] this spake he of the
[3:01:04] spirit which day that believe on him
[3:01:09] should what
[3:01:11] reive there is two words there I can't
[3:01:14] get in detail
[3:01:15] now there is
[3:01:19] believe oh Lord have mercy and
[3:01:26] receive everybody clear follow me
[3:01:29] carefully because probably all of you go
[3:01:31] to
[3:01:33] church so believing
[3:01:37] Jesus is
[3:01:39] something and receiving the Holy Ghost
[3:01:42] is
[3:01:43] something you may
[3:01:45] believe but you don't have the Holy
[3:01:47] Ghost
[3:01:49] but Jesus say the Bible say this was a
[3:01:52] promise that whoever will believe don't
[3:01:56] stop at believing move forward and go
[3:02:00] get the Holy Ghost before you get the
[3:02:02] Holy Ghost you must first believe are we
[3:02:08] together if I can get there it will
[3:02:11] shock you the Bible says but this spake
[3:02:14] he of the spirit which they that believe
[3:02:17] on him should receive for the Holy Ghost
[3:02:22] was not yet given because that Jesus was
[3:02:26] not yet what
[3:02:28] glorified in other word all the disciple
[3:02:32] didn't have the Holy
[3:02:34] Ghost that's why Jesus told them on the
[3:02:38] day of Pentecost all of you go wait over
[3:02:42] there but I have a problem do you know
[3:02:45] that those disciple were preaching
[3:02:48] I'm asking you a question do you know
[3:02:50] that the disciple were preaching do you
[3:02:53] know that the disciple were Healing The
[3:02:55] Sick know that P Walk On The
[3:02:58] Water whatever they did no Holy
[3:03:03] Ghost so this is the very dangerous
[3:03:06] place that's why people go to church and
[3:03:09] they do Miracle but they don't have the
[3:03:11] Hool it is dangerous wake up my friend
[3:03:18] do you know that Judas did
[3:03:20] Miracle he was among the
[3:03:22] disciple but if you notice he died
[3:03:25] before
[3:03:26] Pentecost he never made
[3:03:30] a so let's be
[3:03:34] careful oh I believe Jesus
[3:03:37] Christ that's good that's the first step
[3:03:40] you already believe 50 years you believe
[3:03:43] 20 years you believe 10 years did you
[3:03:46] receive the Holy Ghost
[3:03:51] let me go to act one and I'm going to
[3:03:53] stop
[3:03:56] here
[3:03:58] hallelujah oh
[3:04:08] God hallelujah amen yeah can touch this
[3:04:11] circumcision it is yeah let's go to act
[3:04:15] chapter one if you there you can say
[3:04:17] Amen
[3:04:19] amen your pastor is pulling and I'm
[3:04:21] trying to let you
[3:04:24] go actually it's uh yeah act
[3:04:30] one verse one
[3:04:32] yes let jop to verse
[3:04:39] four verse four and being assembly
[3:04:42] together with
[3:04:43] them commanded them that they should not
[3:04:48] depart from Jerusalem but
[3:04:52] wait for the
[3:04:55] promise of the Father which he said ye
[3:05:00] have heard of him so Jesus gave them a
[3:05:03] promise he say wait don't go anywhere no
[3:05:06] more preaching all of you stand right
[3:05:09] there ah you preach with me that's say
[3:05:12] I'm going no more preaching all of you
[3:05:15] stay there amen when there verse four
[3:05:19] for John truly baptized with
[3:05:24] water but ye shall be
[3:05:27] baptized with the Holy Ghost not many
[3:05:31] days so the disciple have to wait for
[3:05:35] the holy spirit amen jum to verse
[3:05:40] uh8 but ye shall receive
[3:05:43] power after that the Holy Ghost is com
[3:05:48] upon you and he shall be witness unto me
[3:05:52] in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in
[3:05:56] Samaria and unto the utmost part of the
[3:06:00] earth without that Holy Spirit you are
[3:06:03] not a true
[3:06:04] witness you are the
[3:06:07] religion you just go to
[3:06:10] church when did God talk to you when did
[3:06:14] you listen the voice of God when were
[3:06:16] you sitting and something do
[3:06:20] something and you satisfi the way you
[3:06:23] are canot take few minutes so I can
[3:06:27] reinforce your
[3:06:29] faith go with me to the Book of John
[3:06:32] because I don't want to let you
[3:06:35] hanging go to John
[3:06:39] 14 Hallelujah and then we
[3:06:45] stop amen amen amen John
[3:06:49] 14 verse 16 if you dare you can say Amen
[3:06:53] the Bible says and
[3:06:56] I will pray the
[3:06:59] Father Who Will
[3:07:04] Pray who will pray the
[3:07:06] father
[3:07:11] Jesus ah Lord do you know what it means
[3:07:16] when Jesus pray
[3:07:21] do you know
[3:07:23] that do you know that there is no prayer
[3:07:25] of Jesus that is without
[3:07:28] answer the Bible says the prayer of
[3:07:31] Jesus are always
[3:07:33] answered and now Jesus is saying I'm
[3:07:35] going to pray in other word the problem
[3:07:39] of the Holy Ghost it is no longer God it
[3:07:43] is
[3:07:44] you God already prayed for you
[3:07:48] so don't tell God God is a God has a
[3:07:50] problem God already prayed for it is you
[3:07:53] who have to open your
[3:07:59] heart the Bible says Jesus said and I
[3:08:02] will pray the father and he shall give
[3:08:05] you another
[3:08:07] comforter that he may a b with you
[3:08:14] sometime no repeat what I say that he
[3:08:19] may that he might with you
[3:08:24] sometime that's what the Bible
[3:08:30] say now now now you responding now you
[3:08:33] responding I will give you another
[3:08:35] comforter that he will with you how many
[3:08:39] time
[3:08:41] forever in other word when the Holy
[3:08:44] Ghost will get in you he will never
[3:08:46] leave you
[3:08:49] you are guaranteed to go to the
[3:08:54] Rapture as hard as it seems many people
[3:08:58] preach the Rapture no Holy Ghost no
[3:09:06] Rapture he will be with you
[3:09:09] forever even the spirit of what
[3:09:12] truth whom the world cannot receive it's
[3:09:17] not for everybody you got to be on the
[3:09:20] written on the list the word cannot
[3:09:23] receive because he see him not nether
[3:09:26] know him but he know him for he dwell
[3:09:30] with him and shall be in you because
[3:09:34] Jesus himself have that
[3:09:38] Spirit last
[3:09:40] scripture uh
[3:09:44] John 16 verse 12 we John
[3:09:48] 14 16:2 and let finish
[3:09:52] here Jesus
[3:09:54] say this is very
[3:09:56] deep but may the Lord Inspire your
[3:09:59] pastor to pick it up the Bible says I
[3:10:03] have yet many things to
[3:10:05] say unto you but you cannot bear them
[3:10:10] more Jesus look at the disciple you
[3:10:14] understand now that no disciple had the
[3:10:15] Holy Ghost
[3:10:17] right we agree now because the Bible
[3:10:20] said the Holy Ghost was not yet given
[3:10:22] because Jesus was not yet glorified
[3:10:24] Jesus have to be killed to pay the price
[3:10:26] so the Holy Ghost can come are we
[3:10:29] together so when the disciple look at
[3:10:31] the when Jesus look at the disciple he
[3:10:34] say I have many things to tell you but
[3:10:37] what I have to tell you you cannot
[3:10:40] receive in other word there are certain
[3:10:44] things of God you won't receive it
[3:10:47] because the Holy Ghost is not in you
[3:10:50] yet even if you go to church and the
[3:10:54] pastor preaches you're going to hear
[3:10:56] certain things but those who have the
[3:10:59] Holy Ghost will hear more than what
[3:11:03] you it's in the Bible my
[3:11:07] friend let me read it he says I have yet
[3:11:11] many things to say unto you but you
[3:11:13] cannot bear them now in other word at
[3:11:16] this time you cannot take it you have to
[3:11:19] wait he says how be watch me when he the
[3:11:24] who the spirit of Truth is
[3:11:28] come he will guide you into
[3:11:32] what in other word those things will
[3:11:35] work only when the Holy Ghost
[3:11:39] come when the Holy Ghost come he will
[3:11:41] guide you your perfect
[3:11:45] GPS is the Holy Ghost
[3:11:48] just as you need the good address to get
[3:11:51] somewhere you put the GPS and when you
[3:11:54] put the GPS whether you agree with me or
[3:11:58] not put your faith in the GPS because
[3:12:03] whatever the GPS tells you even if you
[3:12:05] never use that road before you always
[3:12:08] follow the
[3:12:09] GPS until you get there and the GPS say
[3:12:13] you have arriv and the perfect GPS is
[3:12:16] the Holy Spirit
[3:12:17] when he will get in you he will guide
[3:12:20] you and once he begin to guide you he
[3:12:24] will be in you and when he gu you you
[3:12:27] going to put your faith in him and
[3:12:29] sometime he will take you into Road you
[3:12:33] don't understand I've been in Boston but
[3:12:36] never seen him before this is the first
[3:12:39] time I saw him because somebody is
[3:12:41] guiding me and he guide me to you so
[3:12:45] that I can talk to you seen all of I
[3:12:48] never met you before I didn't know you
[3:12:51] want the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost
[3:12:53] guide me all the way to Boston to talk
[3:12:56] to you he will guide you in all truth
[3:12:59] until you have arriv may God fill you
[3:13:03] Holy Spirit may God give you what you
[3:13:06] desire may God give you what you came
[3:13:09] here
[3:13:10] for not being V God grant you the desire
[3:13:15] of your heart
[3:13:17] with the spirit of Godly bless bless you
[3:13:23] my my my my amen my my my
[3:13:28] my oh my I can't hold
[3:13:32] myself hallelujah

[3:13:42] good are we
[3:13:45] digesting the promise is for you
[3:13:48] it's for all of us
[3:13:51] amen and this is the problem here God
[3:13:55] already invest himself in
[3:13:58] it when God invest himself in
[3:14:02] something it means nothing else can stop
[3:14:06] it because when God put himself in the
[3:14:11] thing can you imagine you pray for the
[3:14:13] Holy
[3:14:14] Ghost but Jesus say I will pray for
[3:14:19] you
[3:14:21] amen you pray for the Holy Ghost but he
[3:14:25] said I will pray the
[3:14:28] father Jesus prayed for
[3:14:31] us but it's up to us to open the door
[3:14:35] for him because he stand at the
[3:14:38] door and he say I'm
[3:14:41] knocking open the door open not just the
[3:14:45] door but but all the
[3:14:48] doors
[3:14:50] Pride private life open the
[3:14:55] doors and when you open the
[3:14:58] doors he will come in and will dine with
[3:15:02] you he will give you the understanding
[3:15:06] and the things that he will
[3:15:08] say you will understand it and when you
[3:15:13] understand it you can be saved by your
[3:15:16] understanding
[3:15:18] your understanding changes your
[3:15:20] faith and it does a bit a
[3:15:24] lot but we're going to continue
[3:15:26] tomorrow
