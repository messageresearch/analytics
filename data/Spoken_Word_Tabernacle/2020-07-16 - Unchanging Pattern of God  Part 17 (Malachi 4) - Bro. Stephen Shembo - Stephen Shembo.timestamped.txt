[23:53] all things are
[23:57] possible
[24:02] jesus
[24:04] thank you jesus

[24:10] [Music]
[24:14] jesus is here
[24:19] all things are
[24:22] possible
[24:26] jesus is here
[24:29] god bless you all tonight good to see
[24:33] everybody in the house of the lord god
[24:35] bless you my sister that guitar
[24:37] is playing pretty good
[24:45] hallelujah praise the lord
[24:50] let's go to malachi chapter four
[24:54] as we promise we will get the portion of
[24:57] john the baptist
[24:58] here that is the more confusing one
[25:03] so trust
[25:07] those that are not here tonight will
[25:09] catch up so it will help them on
[25:10] wednesday
[25:11] on a malachi chapter 4
[25:15] verse 5 if you're there you can say amen
[25:24] the bible says behold we already
[25:27] explained the law
[25:28] of moses my servant in horrible
[25:31] behold i will send you elijah the
[25:34] prophet
[25:35] we explained this extensively
[25:38] before the coming of the great and
[25:41] dreadful day
[25:42] of the lord so there is a day that is a
[25:45] day of judgment
[25:46] as elijah the prophet verse 6
[25:49] you might see it
[25:54] those people say that this belongs to
[25:56] israel
[25:58] so let's see and verse six and he shall
[26:02] turn
[26:03] the heart of the fathers to
[26:06] the children so the first thing that is
[26:09] mentioned on verse 6
[26:10] is that this elijah
[26:16] will turn the heart of the fathers
[26:20] toward the children
[26:24] so when the bible say
[26:27] children we usually have a tendency to
[26:30] think that there are many children
[26:33] but if you search the the scripture
[26:35] pretty good
[26:36] that children was speaking about one
[26:41] it goes slowly he shall turn
[26:45] the heart his intent is to take the
[26:48] heart
[26:48] of the father
[26:52] we already seen what the ministry of
[26:54] elijah does and
[26:55] turn those heart to the faith of the
[26:58] children
[26:59] and he shall turn the heart of the
[27:01] fathers to the children
[27:03] and the heart of the children to their
[27:06] father so there is another section
[27:08] where the heart of the children are
[27:11] turned to the father
[27:12] i'm not gonna touch that today we're
[27:15] just gonna
[27:16] mention the heart of the father to the
[27:18] children
[27:20] everybody clear and the heart of the
[27:23] children
[27:24] to their father lester come and smite
[27:27] the earth
[27:28] with a curse so the heart
[27:32] is singular here turn to the children
[27:35] everybody clear so far let's go to the
[27:37] book of luke chapter one
[27:44] brother mike probably you can close the
[27:46] door please thank you
[27:48] luke chapter 1 verse 13
[27:52] we are dealing with john the baptist so
[27:54] manly
[27:55] turning the heart of the fathers to the
[27:58] children
[28:01] luke chapter 1 verse 13
[28:04] if you're there you can say amen but the
[28:06] angels say
[28:08] to him fear not zechariah
[28:11] for your prayer is heard and your wife
[28:14] elizabeth shall bear your son shall bear
[28:17] you a son
[28:18] and you shall call his name john and we
[28:22] know that
[28:22] john according to what we have been
[28:24] studying
[28:25] was elijah because jesus christ pointed
[28:28] to us that john the baptist
[28:30] was the elijah that should come
[28:33] everybody clear
[28:34] verse 14 and you shall and you shall
[28:38] have joy and gladness
[28:40] and many shall rejoice at his birth the
[28:42] birth of john
[28:44] for he shall be great in the sight of
[28:46] the lord
[28:48] and shall drink neither wine nor strong
[28:51] drink so this elijah here has a
[28:54] restriction
[28:55] not to drink wine or strong
[28:59] drink so no wine here
[29:03] and no strong drink
[29:07] in other words if we bring it today no
[29:10] wine
[29:10] and no beer are we clear
[29:14] okay because the spirit of elijah
[29:18] when it comes upon john the baptist
[29:20] there is a restriction
[29:22] on the life of john the baptist you
[29:25] cannot drink
[29:26] wine nor strong drink
[29:29] right and we found out that brother
[29:32] branham also had a restriction
[29:34] in his life not to defile his
[29:38] body are we there no cigarette
[29:41] no drink no women nothing everybody
[29:44] clear
[29:45] okay verse 15 for he shall be great in
[29:49] the sight of the lord
[29:50] and shall drink neither wine nor strong
[29:53] drink and he shall be
[29:54] filled with the holy ghost even from his
[29:58] mother's
[29:59] womb i told you that john was the
[30:02] yellow light right he was not green
[30:06] neither red but through the yellow you
[30:10] can pass through
[30:11] right but the dispensation of the holy
[30:14] spirit
[30:14] was not there yet according to john
[30:17] chapter 7
[30:18] we found out on sunday that the holy
[30:20] spirit was not
[30:22] yet given so you found out that this
[30:25] holy spirit
[30:26] of john is nothing else but the spirit
[30:30] of elijah
[30:34] okay the spirit of elijah
[30:38] is a spirit of christ are you there
[30:42] but when he works into a man elijah
[30:45] they call that the spirit of elijah
[30:48] it is not the man spirit of elijah
[30:52] it is an anointing of god that expressed
[30:55] itself in the ministry of elijah
[30:59] are you there it is the spirit of
[31:02] a lion it is the spirit of an ox it is
[31:05] the spirit of a man
[31:07] it is a spirit of an ego all those
[31:09] spirits
[31:10] are still the anointing of god
[31:14] everybody clear okay verse 16
[31:19] and many of the children of israel
[31:22] shall he turn to the lord their god
[31:25] so something happened to the children of
[31:27] israel
[31:28] that they were driven away from god so
[31:31] elijah have to come
[31:33] take the children of israel which we
[31:36] call the fathers
[31:38] and turn them back to the children
[31:40] everybody clear
[31:42] now verse 17 i want everybody to look at
[31:45] this
[31:46] and he shall go before him in the spirit
[31:49] everybody see now they said the holy
[31:52] spirit but now it's very specific
[31:54] in the spirit and power of who
[31:58] everybody clear of elijah to
[32:01] turn the heart of the father
[32:05] to the children and the heart
[32:08] of the children to the father did he say
[32:11] that
[32:12] did he say that okay you see now
[32:16] in malachi 4 he says that we turn the
[32:19] heart of the father
[32:20] to the children and the heart of the
[32:23] children
[32:23] to the father but when luke is
[32:26] describing the ministry of
[32:28] john the baptist luke only use the first
[32:32] part
[32:34] are you there look never say the heart
[32:37] of the children
[32:38] to the father look only picked
[32:42] so in other words luke went to the book
[32:44] of
[32:45] uh malachi 4 and only pulled
[32:48] this scripture and said this scripture
[32:51] is the one that belonged to john the
[32:53] baptist
[32:54] not the other one are you there
[32:57] cool we will explain that on sunday
[33:01] and he shall go before him in the spirit
[33:03] and power of elijah
[33:05] to turn the heart of the father to the
[33:08] children
[33:09] that's all that have to do with john in
[33:12] malachi
[33:13] 4. nothing else if you want to see john
[33:16] he's isaiah 40 if you want to see john
[33:19] he's malachi 3
[33:21] but if you want to go to malachi 4 the
[33:24] only portion that belonged to john the
[33:26] baptist
[33:27] is only turning the heart of the father
[33:30] to the children
[33:31] period the bible never described
[33:33] anything else
[33:34] the brother the bible never taken that
[33:36] the day shall burn like an
[33:38] oven that doesn't belong to john that's
[33:41] the reason why after the ministry of
[33:43] john there was no earth that was burned
[33:46] because he doesn't belong to john the
[33:48] baptist the only portion of john is
[33:51] taking the heart of the father and
[33:53] turning them back to the
[33:55] children are you there the heart of the
[33:58] fathers to the children
[33:59] and the disobedient to the wisdom
[34:02] of the just who's this just
[34:07] so the heart of the father
[34:10] to the children luke explained us a
[34:13] little bit more
[34:14] he said the disobedient
[34:18] everybody there to what d
[34:22] just who's the just
[34:27] but god right who's the just one
[34:32] but christ everybody there and the
[34:35] disobedient
[34:36] to the wisdom of the just to make ready
[34:40] a people prepare for the lord
[34:44] so the lord was coming there was a
[34:47] coming of the lord and that coming the
[34:49] lord have to enter
[34:50] suddenly into his temple and that temple
[34:53] was the lord jesus christ
[34:55] so john have to take the heart of israel
[34:58] of the father and turn them back to the
[35:01] just
[35:02] one the just one which is crust
[35:05] everybody clear so far no problem
[35:09] let's go to luke chapter 3 now then we
[35:11] will be praying
[35:14] this is very important
[35:18] because this is where the mess are
[35:20] coming from
[35:22] luke chapter 3 verse 3 if you dare you
[35:25] can say amen
[35:26] and he came into all the country about
[35:29] jordan
[35:30] preaching the baptism of repentance for
[35:32] remission of sin we seen that on fight
[35:34] on uh
[35:35] on sunday we explained that the
[35:37] remission of the scene he was just
[35:38] pointing
[35:39] but he didn't do it because the lamb was
[35:41] the one that was
[35:42] taking away the sin of the world as it
[35:45] is written in the book of the word of
[35:47] isaiah the prophet saying
[35:49] the voice of one crying in the
[35:50] wilderness prepare
[35:52] you the way of the lord make his path
[35:55] straight that isaiah 40. we explain it
[35:58] every valley shall be filled and every
[36:00] mountain and hill shall be brought low
[36:03] and the crooked shall be made straight
[36:05] and the rough ways
[36:06] shall be made smooth john was now
[36:09] working in the construction
[36:11] on the road this road is the road
[36:14] to the heart he was preparing the heart
[36:17] not the highways
[36:18] are you there okay and then all flesh
[36:22] shall see the salvation of
[36:24] god remember the salvation of god there
[36:27] is no name
[36:28] under heaven from people for uh uh
[36:31] where the people must be saved except in
[36:33] the name of
[36:34] jesus everybody clear then
[36:38] said he to the multitude that came forth
[36:41] to be baptized of him
[36:42] all generation of what so john is
[36:46] looking at people
[36:47] but when he looked at them he called
[36:49] them a generation
[36:51] of vipers in other words a generation of
[36:54] snake
[36:56] if you go in the book of matthew chapter
[37:00] 3
[37:00] the bible clearly stated that those
[37:03] people
[37:04] were the pharisees and the sadducees
[37:08] if you look at matthew chapter 3 if you
[37:10] need that scripture
[37:12] you can see me later and i will give it
[37:14] to you so when john
[37:15] looked at the people he looked at the
[37:18] pharisee
[37:18] he looked at the sadducees and he looked
[37:21] at them he said
[37:22] you are of the brood or the generation
[37:26] or the children of the snake
[37:29] of the viper that's why jesus in john
[37:33] chapter 8 when he look at those people
[37:35] he said you are of your father the devil
[37:40] are you there and he said he was a
[37:42] murderer from the beginning
[37:44] and the murderer from the beginning was
[37:46] ken
[37:48] which was the son of the wicked one
[37:51] so john the baptist when the anointing
[37:54] of elijah comes upon him
[37:56] he also described the serpent seed
[38:02] everybody clear the anointing of elijah
[38:05] coming on john
[38:07] forbid him to defile his body the
[38:10] anointing of
[38:11] elijah coming on john express
[38:14] the serpentine so when we see elijah
[38:18] today
[38:19] he must have restriction not to defer
[38:21] his body
[38:22] when we see elijah today he must also
[38:25] preach the serpent seed
[38:27] everybody clear praise the lord let's go
[38:30] to verse 10
[38:32] and the people ask him saying what shall
[38:35] we do then
[38:37] the people did what they asked him so
[38:40] there were people that came to john
[38:43] that asked him certain things
[38:47] verse 11 and he answers
[38:51] are you there so john
[38:54] when the spirit of elijah came upon him
[38:57] he came with a message and through that
[39:00] message
[39:01] john have a session of question and
[39:04] answers
[39:11] are we clear
[39:15] oh my god
[39:18] he answered and said to them he that has
[39:21] two coats let him
[39:22] impart to him that has known and he that
[39:25] has me
[39:25] let him do likewise then come also the
[39:28] public and to be baptized and say to him
[39:30] master
[39:31] what shall we do questions and answers
[39:34] and he said to them
[39:35] exactly no more than that which is
[39:38] appointed you
[39:39] and the soldier likewise demanded of him
[39:42] saying
[39:42] and what shall we do question and answer
[39:45] everybody there
[39:46] and he said to them due violence to no
[39:50] man neither accuse any falsely
[39:52] and be content with your wage and as the
[39:55] people were in expectation
[39:58] and all men mused in the heart of john
[40:01] whether he wear the crust or not
[40:04] everybody clear verse 16 john
[40:08] answered saying to them all i indeed
[40:10] baptize you with water we went through
[40:12] this on sunday
[40:13] but one monday the night comes the
[40:16] latchette of whose shoes i'm not worthy
[40:18] to unleash we explained that one
[40:20] he shall baptize you with the holy ghost
[40:22] and with fire
[40:24] he was pointing them to the future in
[40:26] the ministry of john
[40:28] there will be restriction to his body in
[40:31] the ministry of john
[40:32] elijah serpent seed will be preached in
[40:35] the ministry of john
[40:37] there will be session of question and
[40:39] answer everybody clear
[40:41] let's jump to verse 18 then we will be
[40:43] praying
[40:44] and many other things in his exhortation
[40:47] preach he to the people but harold the
[40:51] tetrarch
[40:52] being reproved in other words rebuke by
[40:55] him for
[40:55] herodias his brothers philip's wife
[40:58] and for all evil which herod has done
[41:02] in other words herod had a brother and
[41:05] the brother has his wife his wife was
[41:07] their
[41:08] work has a name a herodias so
[41:11] his brother was still alive and he went
[41:15] and took his brother's wife and marry
[41:18] him
[41:18] so john came and rebuked him telling him
[41:22] that it was not
[41:23] lawful for him to take his brother wife
[41:26] while the brother is still alive
[41:29] everybody clear
[41:31] added yet this above all that he shut up
[41:35] john
[41:35] into prison so we see here that the
[41:38] anointing of elijah
[41:40] when he comes also on john the baptist
[41:43] he had to deal with marriage and divorce
[41:48] everybody clear so the anointing of
[41:50] elijah comes
[41:51] restriction to the body preach the
[41:53] serpent seed
[41:54] head question and answer and also have
[41:57] to deal with the question of
[41:59] marriage and divorce everybody clear
[42:02] let's pray now heavenly father lord we
[42:06] thank you again for your grace
[42:07] for your love for your mercy and for
[42:10] everything you are doing for us lord
[42:12] father thank you for giving us another
[42:14] opportunity through this pandemic
[42:17] where we can gather together around the
[42:19] revealed word of the hour
[42:21] lord father and feast as ego lord
[42:24] lord we are committing this service unto
[42:26] the hand made the heaven
[42:28] opens lord and may the holy spirit find
[42:31] another opportunity tonight lord
[42:34] to be uh to refill the temples of god
[42:37] lord
[42:38] father the prophet told us that there is
[42:40] one
[42:41] baptism lord but there are several
[42:44] revealing lord
[42:45] father may this be another opportunity
[42:47] for you to fill your children lord
[42:50] and those that miss it lord may this be
[42:52] the opportunity
[42:54] to seal them into the kingdom father we
[42:56] rebuke every work of the devil
[42:59] and commit this service unto the hand in
[43:01] the name of jesus christ
[43:03] amen praise the lord we are in part
[43:07] 17 and still dealing with john the
[43:10] baptist before we get to
[43:12] malachi 4 we spoke about these three
[43:16] dispensations we found out that there is
[43:18] a dispensation of the law
[43:20] we found that there is a dispensation of
[43:23] grace where
[43:24] god leave the jewish people and go to
[43:26] the gentile people
[43:27] and we also find that after finishing
[43:30] with the gentile people
[43:32] the lord will go back to the jewish
[43:34] people to pick up
[43:35] the hundred and forty four thousand so
[43:38] when we dealt
[43:39] with the character that we use here we
[43:42] found out that
[43:43] all this character moses was a jew
[43:46] john the baptist was a jew paul was a
[43:49] jew
[43:50] moses and elijah and mon transfiguration
[43:52] were jews
[43:53] moses and elijah going back to the
[43:55] gentile are the 244 000
[43:57] was jew but there is a specific ministry
[44:00] of elijah
[44:01] which deal with their gender and the
[44:04] pardon is still the same
[44:06] moses elijah moses elijah
[44:09] moses elijah and moses and elijah
[44:13] so now we're gonna clear the third
[44:16] uh dispensation we will be dealing with
[44:19] these
[44:20] two the first one deal with the coming
[44:24] of the lord
[44:25] as a baby through the virgin
[44:28] and then the second one deal with the
[44:30] second coming of the lord
[44:32] as the lion of the tribe of judah which
[44:35] is
[44:36] leo the lion in these two dispensation
[44:40] we found the pattern are still
[44:42] consistent
[44:43] we found that israel started with a man
[44:46] by the name of moses
[44:48] then before the coming of jesus christ
[44:50] as a baby
[44:52] born through a virgin because isaiah
[44:54] said that
[44:55] the a child is born a son is given
[44:59] and his name will be wonderful counselor
[45:02] prince of peace mighty god so that child
[45:06] was god in the form of a baby are you
[45:09] there
[45:10] so when before jesus christ come back
[45:13] as a baby only on on this earth
[45:16] according to the prophecy of moses
[45:18] in deuteronomy 3 18 18 which moses said
[45:22] that the lord your god shall send you
[45:24] a prophet like unto me so before he
[45:27] comes
[45:28] we find a man comes up by the name of
[45:31] john the baptist which is elijah then
[45:34] when the dispersation of grace started
[45:36] to the gentile
[45:38] it started with a man by the name of
[45:40] paul which we described and
[45:42] unveiled through the teaching of the
[45:44] message that paul
[45:45] was our modern moses and at the end
[45:49] before
[45:50] the coming of jesus christ to take
[45:53] his blood into the rapture we found out
[45:55] that there is a dealing
[45:57] of elijah through the gentile everybody
[46:00] clear
[46:01] now as we start back on the top because
[46:04] we are dealing with
[46:05] john the baptist we found out that
[46:08] israel
[46:09] was in egypt under bondage right
[46:13] so when moses went moses got into
[46:16] egypt and uh actually israel got
[46:20] into egypt and moses was born there
[46:23] and through the hand of moses god used
[46:27] moses to withdraw
[46:29] israel from egypt everybody following
[46:32] now brother branham says this in god
[46:35] talked to moses
[46:36] brother branham said that all those
[46:39] types of old
[46:41] they were just shadows of the things
[46:43] that was
[46:44] to come in other words if you look in
[46:47] the old testament
[46:48] it's only pointing you or give you a
[46:51] clue
[46:52] to what is coming down into the future
[46:54] when they were killing the lamb into the
[46:56] temple
[46:57] that lamb was just telling you that one
[46:59] day a lamb of god will come
[47:02] and will be killed to take away the sin
[47:04] of the
[47:05] world now i believe that that was
[47:08] the church natural so brother branham is
[47:11] calling
[47:12] the dispensation of the law that it was
[47:15] a church
[47:17] but that church was natural everybody
[47:20] clear
[47:22] the jewish church that was brought out
[47:25] of
[47:25] egypt to palestine was the natural
[47:29] church god's natural people
[47:33] who had a natural law so the first
[47:36] dispensation brother branham is telling
[47:39] us that
[47:40] in the first dispensation there is
[47:43] a church there and that church is a
[47:47] jewish church
[47:50] and that church was under the law
[47:53] everybody clear now he says
[47:57] but we today are god spiritual
[48:01] church we are temples right with
[48:04] a spiritual law written on the tables of
[48:09] our heart
[48:10] led in a spiritual form in other words
[48:14] what happened natural to israel
[48:16] it is happening to us spiritually
[48:20] now they looked up to see where the
[48:23] pillar of fire was
[48:25] the angel of the lord but we don't look
[48:28] today in other words when israel was
[48:31] leaving the promised land
[48:33] and following god was clearly
[48:36] visible by the pillar of fire they can
[48:39] look
[48:39] and see that god is there god is moving
[48:42] there
[48:42] but brother branham said that in our
[48:45] time god
[48:46] is invisible everybody there there is
[48:49] just something happen
[48:51] that we know he's there in other words
[48:53] even though god is invisible
[48:56] but yet we can feel his presence we know
[48:58] that god
[48:59] is there everybody clear now
[49:02] they were the people of god israel down
[49:06] in egypt
[49:07] where the people of god until they came
[49:10] out of
[49:10] egypt and started toward the promised
[49:13] land
[49:14] then they became the church of god in
[49:17] other words
[49:17] when israel was in egypt
[49:21] they were called the people of god
[49:25] everybody there but when they came out
[49:28] of egypt they will call now
[49:32] the church of god
[49:36] everybody clear where does brother
[49:38] branham get those stuff from
[49:41] the word church means called out
[49:45] i love that separated one in other words
[49:49] israel was caught out of egypt israel
[49:52] was separated
[49:53] from the nation of egypt because the
[49:56] first pharaoh must
[49:57] die everybody clear okay
[50:01] in the ever-present water from the rock
[50:03] brother branham say
[50:05] when israel was in egypt they were the
[50:08] people of
[50:09] god i'm still insisting on that then
[50:12] when they were called they were called
[50:14] out
[50:15] or had the exodus coming out
[50:18] then they were called the church because
[50:22] it was then they separated themselves
[50:25] from the rest of
[50:26] the world and the very word
[50:29] church means called out exodus
[50:32] come out each one of us now
[50:35] in the spiritual that was natural each
[50:38] one of us as
[50:39] christian has had an exodus in our
[50:43] life so just like israel came out of the
[50:46] world in
[50:48] egypt each one of us do we have the time
[50:51] where we came out of the world
[50:53] everybody clear we had a time where we
[50:56] were called out from among our
[50:58] associates
[50:59] call that from among the people that we
[51:01] want fellowship with
[51:03] and become a different people to work
[51:07] with a different people
[51:08] that adapted a different way and talk a
[51:11] different way
[51:12] he was an exodus in our life
[51:15] everybody cleared so far now the third
[51:19] one brother branham said that
[51:20] israel again was the people of
[51:24] god until we found in acts
[51:27] 7 38 i love brother branham if you are
[51:30] putting it down
[51:31] that then they were called the church of
[51:34] god
[51:35] because they were called by god
[51:38] out of egypt out of the world and
[51:42] away from other churches all the way
[51:45] from other religions
[51:46] to work with god alone the church of god
[51:50] today
[51:51] is the same thing called out of
[51:54] everything of the world called out of
[51:57] every religious cult
[51:59] called out of every religious
[52:00] denomination
[52:02] called out of every religion
[52:04] organization to work with
[52:06] god not to be governed by a bishop
[52:09] but being governed by christ in this
[52:12] messiah
[52:13] kingdom that we live in christ is the
[52:16] king and christ is day
[52:17] one so brother branham gives us a
[52:19] scripture on
[52:20] acts chapter 7 verse 38 let's go to that
[52:24] scripture
[52:27] say wednesday so let's take it as sunday
[52:30] school
[52:33] if you dare you can say amen
[52:37] chapter 7 verse 34 you there you can say
[52:40] amen
[52:41] brother branham keeps saying that when
[52:43] israel was in egypt they were what
[52:46] the people of god when they came out of
[52:48] egypt they were called what
[52:49] the church of god where does brother
[52:51] branham get that
[52:55] act chapter 7 verse 34 i have seen
[53:00] i have seen the affliction of what
[53:03] my people which is in that's why brother
[53:07] branham said that when they were in
[53:08] egypt they were called what
[53:10] the people of god everybody clear now
[53:14] i see they are fleeting off my people
[53:17] which is in egypt
[53:19] and i have heard they're groaning and
[53:21] i'm come down to deliver them
[53:23] and now and now come i will send you
[53:27] into egypt
[53:28] this moses whom they refused saying who
[53:31] made you a ruler and a judge
[53:33] the same did god sent to be the ruler
[53:36] and the deliverer by the hand of an
[53:38] angel which appeared to him in the bush
[53:40] he bought them out he brought them out
[53:43] after that
[53:44] he had had short wonders and sons
[53:47] in the land of egypt and in the red sea
[53:50] and in the wilderness 40 years this is
[53:53] that moses which
[53:54] which said to the children of israel a
[53:57] prophet shall
[53:58] the lord your god weighs up to you of
[54:00] your brethren
[54:01] like to me him shall you hear he
[54:03] prophesy about christ
[54:05] everybody clear watch verse 38 brother
[54:08] branham gave us 38.
[54:10] this is he that was in there
[54:13] everybody can you say it loud in the
[54:16] church
[54:17] right in the church in the
[54:21] why in the wilderness because they are
[54:23] out of what
[54:25] egypt that's why brother branham say
[54:28] that when
[54:28] israel was in egypt they were called the
[54:31] people of god when they were out of
[54:33] egypt they were the
[54:34] church of god the prophet is line up
[54:38] with the bible
[54:41] if you don't see it relax
[54:45] that was in the church in the wilderness
[54:47] with the angel which spoke to him
[54:49] in the month sana and with our fathers
[54:52] who received the lovely oracle
[54:54] to give to us so what i'm trying to
[54:57] bring out
[54:58] here is that when israel came out of
[55:02] egypt
[55:03] israel became the church of the living
[55:06] god
[55:07] so the church under the old
[55:10] dispensation started with a prophet
[55:14] by the name of moses everybody clear
[55:18] and the church in the new testament
[55:22] started by the prophet by the name of
[55:25] paul are we clear now
[55:28] so this church here was under
[55:31] the law but the church down here
[55:35] was under grace everybody clear now
[55:39] now where are we going with this brother
[55:41] stephen
[55:43] in the water of separation brother
[55:44] branham said there's seven different
[55:46] streets
[55:47] represented the seven church ages israel
[55:51] natural
[55:52] everybody see that and the gentile
[55:54] church in
[55:55] spiritual seven churches just
[55:58] exactly the same way this is the
[56:02] key israel had seven churches
[56:07] everybody here so just like we have
[56:11] seven heritages israel also have
[56:14] seven church ages their seven church
[56:18] churches were under the law
[56:20] our seven churches is under grace
[56:24] their seven churches started with moses
[56:27] our seven thirteen decided with paul
[56:31] moses was a prophet paul was a prophet
[56:34] moses wrote the book and paul also wrote
[56:37] the
[56:38] books we clear now
[56:41] all right right in its broom of its best
[56:45] came ahab and married this idolatry
[56:49] and brought an idolatry and caused
[56:50] idolatry in israel
[56:52] the christian church did the same thing
[56:54] out of the dark
[56:56] ages so brother branham is telling you
[56:59] that
[56:59] when israel started in egypt israel
[57:03] started
[57:03] as a church when they came out so
[57:06] brother bradham said through the life
[57:09] journey of israel as a church
[57:13] it started with a prophet by the name of
[57:16] moses
[57:18] but in the middle of that church we
[57:20] found a king
[57:21] that came by the name of ahab and
[57:24] married a woman by the name of
[57:27] jezebel and brother branham said the
[57:29] same thing happened also to the
[57:32] gentile church ages through the dark
[57:34] edges
[57:35] and the dark edges is the edge of the
[57:38] tartarian
[57:40] and under this age if you look in the
[57:43] book of revelation
[57:44] you will find that the bible mentioned
[57:46] the woman
[57:47] jezebel everybody there
[57:50] because what branham said that this is
[57:53] where the
[57:54] church and the state get married
[57:56] together
[57:57] this is where ahab and jezebel got
[58:00] married together
[58:01] so brother branham is telling you that
[58:03] israel
[58:04] had seven church ages naturally
[58:07] and they also have their dark ages
[58:09] through arab
[58:10] and our church ages also have seven
[58:13] churches
[58:14] spiritually and we also have our
[58:17] tartarian
[58:19] church which is their dark ages and what
[58:22] happened here
[58:23] happened also in israel so what happened
[58:27] under jezebel
[58:28] was only a shadow a tap
[58:32] showing you that when god will deal with
[58:34] the gentiles
[58:36] that spirit will come back again in
[58:38] other words spirit does not
[58:40] die everybody clear
[58:44] but brahman continued he said come on
[58:47] writing and married right in the same
[58:50] thing and brought a dollar tree to the
[58:51] christian church again
[58:53] see just exactly perfectly
[58:57] clear in the patmos vision brother
[59:00] branham say
[59:02] one of these days i shall bring up
[59:05] and show you that israel had seven
[59:08] church ages
[59:10] he didn't do it it's up to you to dig
[59:13] and to find out now right seven church
[59:17] ages two
[59:18] and tap exactly with these
[59:21] so we found out now that israel have
[59:25] seven church ages and the gentiles also
[59:28] have
[59:29] seven church ages the seven church
[59:31] churches of israel started with
[59:34] moses ended with elijah
[59:37] and then jesus christ came our seven
[59:40] church ages started with another
[59:43] moses it shall end with elijah
[59:46] and then jesus will come because god
[59:49] does not
[59:51] change everybody clear now
[59:54] let's take hebrew chapter three
[1:00:03] if you dare you can say amen
[1:00:08] hebrew chapter three
[1:00:12] first
[1:00:16] one everybody there wherefore holy
[1:00:20] brethren partaker of the heavenly
[1:00:22] calling
[1:00:23] consider the apostle and high priest of
[1:00:25] our confession
[1:00:26] christ jesus who was faithful
[1:00:29] to him that appointed him as also who
[1:00:34] moses was faithful in all his house
[1:00:37] so we're talking about moses for this
[1:00:39] man
[1:00:41] was counted worthy of more glory than
[1:00:43] moses
[1:00:44] this is jesus christ in as much
[1:00:47] in uh in as much as
[1:00:51] he who has built the house has more
[1:00:54] honor than the house
[1:00:55] for every house is built by some men but
[1:00:58] he that built
[1:00:59] all things is god watch now carefully
[1:01:02] here
[1:01:03] and moses verily was faithful in his
[1:01:07] house as a servant
[1:01:10] for a testimony of those things which
[1:01:12] were to be spoken
[1:01:14] after it was a shadow everybody here
[1:01:18] but christ as a son
[1:01:21] of his own house whose house we
[1:01:24] are remember we are the temple of god
[1:01:26] everybody clear
[1:01:28] if we hold fast the confidence and the
[1:01:30] rejoicing of the hope
[1:01:32] firm to the end so we found in verse 5
[1:01:35] here that moses also built a house
[1:01:41] going solely everybody there let me go
[1:01:44] back to first
[1:01:45] five and moses verily was faithful in
[1:01:49] his house so moses built our
[1:01:52] house moses built a foundation
[1:01:57] are you there everybody clear so far
[1:02:00] just follow me slowly you're gonna come
[1:02:02] up all right
[1:02:03] let's go to first corinthians 3.
[1:02:11] first corinthians 3 if you dare you can
[1:02:15] say amen
[1:02:17] verse 9 we read this on sunday but we
[1:02:20] are liberated together with god
[1:02:23] you are god's garden husbandry you
[1:02:25] remember that
[1:02:26] you are god building remember we just
[1:02:29] read over there
[1:02:30] where they say that we are the house of
[1:02:32] god but moses had the house
[1:02:35] also are you there now we are dealing
[1:02:38] with paul
[1:02:39] paul says that we are the house of god
[1:02:42] too
[1:02:43] but let's see if paul also built a house
[1:02:47] are we going together okay verse 10
[1:02:51] according to the grace of god which is
[1:02:53] given to me
[1:02:54] as it was so power was also air
[1:02:58] building everybody clear aniwa as a wise
[1:03:02] master builder
[1:03:04] i have laid the foundation and another
[1:03:07] built their own
[1:03:08] but let every man take heed how he built
[1:03:12] there upon
[1:03:13] for other foundation can no man lay then
[1:03:16] that is led which is jesus
[1:03:18] christ so just like the seven church
[1:03:21] ages of israel
[1:03:23] started with a prophet moses and moses
[1:03:26] laid the foundation of
[1:03:28] the law are we there building his house
[1:03:32] on the law
[1:03:33] in the gentile side paul also comes
[1:03:37] but paul built the foundation according
[1:03:40] to the
[1:03:41] dispensation of the grace that was given
[1:03:44] unto him everybody built a foundation
[1:03:47] this one also built a foundation
[1:03:50] everybody there
[1:03:51] so at the end of paul of moses ministry
[1:03:55] something happened let's go to
[1:03:57] deuteronomy
[1:03:58] chapter 31
[1:04:05] if you dare you can say amen
[1:04:08] i need to go this way so we clear the
[1:04:11] smoke one time
[1:04:14] aussies elijah moses elijah under the
[1:04:18] law
[1:04:18] and the grace this one built a house
[1:04:21] established the law
[1:04:23] this one built a house laid the
[1:04:25] foundation
[1:04:26] establish grace everybody there now
[1:04:29] before moses died
[1:04:30] in deuteronomy 31 verse 24 if you dare
[1:04:34] you can say amen
[1:04:36] moses said and the bible say and he come
[1:04:38] to pass
[1:04:40] when moses had made an end of writing
[1:04:42] the word of this law
[1:04:43] he established the law in a book until
[1:04:47] they were finished
[1:04:48] that moses commanded the leader which
[1:04:50] bore the ark of the covenant of the lord
[1:04:52] saying
[1:04:53] take this book of the law and put it in
[1:04:55] the side
[1:04:57] in the side of the ark of the covenant
[1:04:59] of the lord your god
[1:05:00] that he may be therefore for a witness
[1:05:03] against you
[1:05:04] why against them
[1:05:07] let's continue verse 27
[1:05:11] for i know everybody there your
[1:05:14] rebellion
[1:05:15] and your stiff neck behold while i'm yet
[1:05:18] alive with you this day
[1:05:20] you have been rebellious against the
[1:05:21] lord and how much more after my death
[1:05:24] so before paul moses died moses says
[1:05:28] that i know i'm gonna die
[1:05:30] but i already seen your behavior i laid
[1:05:33] the foundation
[1:05:34] i prophesied that the messiah will be
[1:05:37] coming
[1:05:38] but i know when i'm gonna leave
[1:05:42] you will rebel against god after my
[1:05:45] death everybody clear
[1:05:47] verse 28 gathered to me all day
[1:05:50] [Music]
[1:05:52] why the elder
[1:05:57] so before the death of moses moses
[1:06:01] gathered all the
[1:06:02] elders the elders of your tribe and your
[1:06:05] offices
[1:06:06] that i may speak this word in their ears
[1:06:09] and call heaven and earth
[1:06:10] to record against them watch verse 29
[1:06:14] for i know that after my death you will
[1:06:17] orderly corrupt yourself
[1:06:18] everybody seen that and turn aside from
[1:06:21] the
[1:06:22] way which i have commanded
[1:06:25] you i have led the foundation i have
[1:06:28] given you the law
[1:06:29] but i know when i'm dying and going
[1:06:33] you're gonna live that love everybody
[1:06:35] clear
[1:06:37] and evil will before you in the ladders
[1:06:41] you see the latter's days
[1:06:44] because you would do evil in the sight
[1:06:46] of the lord
[1:06:47] to provoke him to anger through the work
[1:06:50] of your
[1:06:51] hand so paul built a house establish a
[1:06:54] house
[1:06:55] before he died he said i know call me
[1:06:58] there
[1:06:59] elder when i'm gonna leave you're gonna
[1:07:01] leave the foundation that i have built
[1:07:04] for you
[1:07:05] that's moses paul also built a
[1:07:08] house but let's see if at the end of
[1:07:11] paul's death
[1:07:13] who is gonna become
[1:07:16] are we okay all right let's go to act
[1:07:20] chapter 20.
[1:07:30] that's why we call this a vaccine
[1:07:34] one time and no more problems are you
[1:07:37] there
[1:07:38] that's a sense of humor
[1:07:42] act chapter 20 verse 17. everybody there
[1:07:46] and for me lettuce this is paul he sent
[1:07:50] to ephesus
[1:07:51] and called who everybody clear
[1:07:55] called the elders off there
[1:07:58] over there they called the others off
[1:08:01] israel
[1:08:02] everybody clear elders elders
[1:08:06] why are they calling the elders let's go
[1:08:08] to verse 29
[1:08:11] everybody there for i know this that
[1:08:15] after my departure shall grieve yous
[1:08:18] wolf
[1:08:19] entering among you not sparing the flock
[1:08:22] so paul is saying that when i leave
[1:08:26] schwaber will come after me greenville's
[1:08:29] wolf will enter
[1:08:31] let's continue verse 39 30.
[1:08:34] also on your own self so there were
[1:08:37] people
[1:08:38] that would get in cause trouble but
[1:08:41] within yourself your rank in the message
[1:08:44] some people that were with you will turn
[1:08:47] around
[1:08:49] everybody there shall men arise
[1:08:52] speaking perverse things they first
[1:08:55] believe with you
[1:08:57] then suddenly they turn around
[1:09:00] to draw away disciple after them
[1:09:05] therefore watch and remember that by the
[1:09:08] space of three years i cease not to warn
[1:09:11] everyone night and day with tears
[1:09:14] everybody there verse 32 and now
[1:09:18] brethren i commend you to god and to the
[1:09:20] word of his grace
[1:09:22] which is able to build you up and to
[1:09:24] give you an inheritance
[1:09:25] an inheritance among all them which are
[1:09:27] satisfied
[1:09:28] i have coveted no man's silver or god or
[1:09:32] a peril so paul also is saying that i
[1:09:35] already laid the foundation but i know
[1:09:38] when i leave that foundation that i have
[1:09:41] established
[1:09:42] sooner than later you're gonna depart
[1:09:44] from it
[1:09:45] but i am commanding you to god and to
[1:09:49] the
[1:09:49] word like moses said i have given you
[1:09:53] the
[1:09:53] law but i know when i die you're gonna
[1:09:56] depart from the law everybody clear
[1:09:59] all right where are we going with this
[1:10:02] let's go now to first samuel chapter
[1:10:03] eight then you see why
[1:10:18] two churches israel natural
[1:10:22] the broad spiritual moses
[1:10:26] elijah the coming of the lord moses
[1:10:29] elijah the coming of the lord moses
[1:10:32] laid the foundation paul lay the
[1:10:34] foundation
[1:10:35] before the end paul said the elders
[1:10:39] come here before the end moses said
[1:10:44] the elders come here okay
[1:10:47] now remember when moses started israel
[1:10:50] church ages started
[1:10:52] are we there first samuel chapter eight
[1:10:55] one verse seven verse one to seven
[1:10:58] and he came to pass israel is in the
[1:11:00] promised land
[1:11:02] when pro when samuel was old that he
[1:11:05] made his son judges over israel
[1:11:08] now the name of his firstborn was joel
[1:11:10] the name of his second
[1:11:12] ebay they were judges in bathsheba
[1:11:15] and his son walked not in his ways but
[1:11:18] turned aside after luke
[1:11:20] and took brab and perverted judgment
[1:11:23] then aldi
[1:11:28] who did moses won
[1:11:32] what are the elders looking for
[1:11:35] when the children of the prophet
[1:11:39] begin to misbehave
[1:11:44] are you there the elder took opportunity
[1:11:50] to bring the agenda blaming
[1:11:54] on the prophet children
[1:11:57] they act like they are against the
[1:12:00] behavior
[1:12:01] of the prophet children but they are not
[1:12:07] let's go the elders
[1:12:10] verse 4 of israel gathered themselves
[1:12:14] together
[1:12:14] and came to samuel to rama and said to
[1:12:17] him
[1:12:17] behold you are old and your son walk not
[1:12:20] in your ways
[1:12:21] now make us a king to judge us like
[1:12:25] older
[1:12:26] if the son have a problem let's deal
[1:12:30] with the prophet's son
[1:12:31] according to the word but don't take
[1:12:34] the prophet's son as an alibaba
[1:12:38] as a reason for you to reject
[1:12:42] the message of god
[1:12:45] are you there first
[1:12:50] 6 but the thing displeased
[1:12:53] samuel when they said give us a king to
[1:12:56] judge
[1:12:57] us they want to be judged as the other
[1:13:00] nation they forget that they were
[1:13:02] different nation
[1:13:04] they want to copy other people who did
[1:13:07] that
[1:13:08] the elders everybody there
[1:13:11] and samuel prayed the lord now it's god
[1:13:14] speaking
[1:13:15] and the lord said to samuel watch what
[1:13:18] god is saying
[1:13:19] hearken to the voice of the people in
[1:13:22] all that they say to you
[1:13:24] for they have not rejected you it looks
[1:13:27] like
[1:13:28] the people the elder rejected the
[1:13:31] prophet
[1:13:32] of the land but god says that
[1:13:35] when they are coming attacking your
[1:13:38] children
[1:13:39] attacking the prophet children
[1:13:43] are you there they are coming attacking
[1:13:45] the prophet children
[1:13:48] and they want to be like they are the
[1:13:50] denomination
[1:13:52] it is not you the prophet that they are
[1:13:55] rejecting
[1:13:56] they are not rejecting the messenger
[1:14:00] are you there he says they are not
[1:14:04] rejecting you but they have rejected
[1:14:07] me that i should not reign over
[1:14:11] them in other words by rejecting the
[1:14:14] messenger
[1:14:15] they are rejecting god
[1:14:19] who did that the elders
[1:14:23] why the elders exposition of the seven
[1:14:29] church ages
[1:14:30] you will recall that are brought out in
[1:14:33] the ephesian churches
[1:14:35] that the word nicolet comes from the
[1:14:39] greek
[1:14:40] word nicao which means conquer
[1:14:44] and leo which means the laity
[1:14:47] nicoleten means to conquer the
[1:14:51] laity now why is this such a terrible
[1:14:55] thing
[1:14:56] it is terrible because god never placed
[1:14:59] his church
[1:15:01] in the hands of an elected leadership
[1:15:04] which moved with
[1:15:05] political miners
[1:15:10] are you there thank you he has placed
[1:15:13] his church in the care of
[1:15:15] god ordained spirit
[1:15:19] filled word living man
[1:15:22] who lead the people through feeding
[1:15:25] them the word that word
[1:15:28] feeding means it's a pastor a
[1:15:32] church must be under a pastor
[1:15:35] but that pastor must be on them filled
[1:15:38] with the spirit
[1:15:39] and he himself leaving the world and
[1:15:42] preaching the word
[1:15:45] everybody there it is true
[1:15:48] that the leadership must be holy but
[1:15:51] then
[1:15:52] so must be the whole congregation there
[1:15:55] is nobody higher than the other
[1:15:57] everybody there god wants all to love
[1:16:01] and serve him together that's why i told
[1:16:04] you
[1:16:05] this church is not one-man show we are
[1:16:07] all together in this
[1:16:10] are you there nicoletanism
[1:16:13] destroy those press those precepts
[1:16:17] and instead separate the minister
[1:16:20] from the people and make the leader of
[1:16:23] the lord
[1:16:24] instead of servant instead of pastor
[1:16:28] staying pastor pastor becomes like
[1:16:30] president
[1:16:32] are you there now
[1:16:35] this doctrine actually started
[1:16:38] as a deed in the first stage
[1:16:42] it appeared that the problem lay
[1:16:45] in two words elders
[1:16:49] presbyters or and overseer
[1:16:52] or bishop so the key here
[1:16:56] moses before he died he called the
[1:16:59] elders
[1:17:00] paul before he died he called their
[1:17:03] elders
[1:17:04] why and we found in the day of samuel
[1:17:07] the elders come and reject the prophet
[1:17:10] and reject god because the elders the
[1:17:13] word elder
[1:17:14] is where the nicolette and spirit enter
[1:17:19] are we there all right
[1:17:24] in the ephesian churches paul's
[1:17:27] wolf remember paul said that when i
[1:17:31] would leave
[1:17:31] there will be grievous wolf brother
[1:17:34] branham said
[1:17:35] paul's wolf had become
[1:17:39] are you there so the nicolet and spirit
[1:17:43] did not start in the church ages he
[1:17:46] started in israel
[1:17:51] are you there they were trying to form a
[1:17:54] priesthood
[1:17:55] like the levitical priesthood which was
[1:17:58] foreign to the new testament
[1:18:00] doctrine the nikawa the greek
[1:18:04] word nico which means to conquer
[1:18:06] overcome
[1:18:07] overcome what the
[1:18:10] laity the holy spirit
[1:18:15] when they rejected samuel god said they
[1:18:18] rejected
[1:18:19] so the elders were pushing the holy
[1:18:23] spirit
[1:18:23] away that's why the sovereignty
[1:18:27] is always to the church
[1:18:32] when you remove the sovereignty from the
[1:18:34] people
[1:18:35] you have conquered the people because
[1:18:38] brother branham said that the majority
[1:18:40] is considered as the holy ghost
[1:18:46] are you there another seer
[1:18:49] trying to take the holy ghost away from
[1:18:51] the laity
[1:18:52] and give it to another call a holy order
[1:18:56] man
[1:18:56] placing them over there laity in other
[1:18:59] words
[1:18:59] we don't want god anymore we want to
[1:19:02] have a king
[1:19:03] like other nations somebody who
[1:19:06] rules
[1:19:09] who's doing that the elders which are
[1:19:13] paused wolves which are nicolette
[1:19:18] second seal you remember the white horse
[1:19:21] rather
[1:19:22] now had no clown when he started
[1:19:24] everybody knows now
[1:19:26] now why he was there
[1:19:29] the new collecting spirit to begin with
[1:19:32] so brother branham is saying that when
[1:19:35] paul says that there will be grievous
[1:19:37] wolf that will enter
[1:19:39] those grievous wolves where exactly
[1:19:42] the antichrist in the white horse rather
[1:19:48] we clear now so what are we talking
[1:19:51] about
[1:19:51] we're talking about that in the seven
[1:19:54] church edges of
[1:19:55] israel under the law the first seal
[1:19:58] also was riding
[1:20:01] are you there that's why brother branham
[1:20:04] said the seventh seal
[1:20:05] start from genesis to revelation
[1:20:08] the sales were running and when the
[1:20:11] church
[1:20:12] started again when jesus goes up
[1:20:15] he sends his spirit on the day of
[1:20:17] pentecost judah also goes
[1:20:20] down and he send his spirit back up
[1:20:22] again and the two spirits
[1:20:24] begin to work in the second church age
[1:20:27] which belong to the
[1:20:28] gentile because spirit don't die
[1:20:32] are we there so when this spirit started
[1:20:36] at the end he destroyed the faith of
[1:20:39] moses
[1:20:40] he destroyed the faith that moses built
[1:20:44] remember they had only one law it was
[1:20:47] the law of moses
[1:20:48] but before jesus christ came from that
[1:20:52] one law
[1:20:53] they had pharisees
[1:20:56] churches they had sadducees
[1:20:59] they had the scrabble they had the
[1:21:02] erodian
[1:21:03] they had the publican in other words
[1:21:05] from one law
[1:21:07] it brought them to a point where they
[1:21:09] have
[1:21:10] multiple denomination
[1:21:13] are you there until the original fell
[1:21:16] from moses was
[1:21:18] destroyed that's why elijah must come
[1:21:24] are you there why the children
[1:21:27] are under herodian their children are
[1:21:30] under the pharisees their children are
[1:21:33] under the sadducees
[1:21:35] this have a doctrine this have a
[1:21:37] judgement they don't even know
[1:21:38] what is the truth so elijah must come
[1:21:42] and to point them to one faith and say
[1:21:45] moses prophesied that the lord your god
[1:21:48] must send you a
[1:21:50] prophet i need to point you back to the
[1:21:53] prophet which is the original faith of
[1:21:56] moses
[1:21:59] are we clear and in the seven church
[1:22:01] churches
[1:22:02] when this started at the end
[1:22:05] what do we see brother branham saying
[1:22:08] do you know that when jesus christ came
[1:22:11] he broke the seals
[1:22:13] you know that if you have the time
[1:22:17] god listen to the sermon the sick seal
[1:22:20] but i'm gonna give you a clue what i'm
[1:22:23] saying
[1:22:24] did you notice when the jews ask him
[1:22:27] when we compare the scripture here with
[1:22:29] matthew 24.
[1:22:30] everybody there with their sixth seal
[1:22:34] the seventh sea was left out
[1:22:37] brother branham took matthew 24 and
[1:22:40] begin to show that
[1:22:42] when jesus was talking jesus was
[1:22:44] breaking the seals
[1:22:46] and when jesus hit the seventh seal they
[1:22:49] asked him
[1:22:50] when is the time of your coming he said
[1:22:53] because the seventh seal is always here
[1:22:56] silence
[1:22:58] are you there what i'm saying because
[1:23:01] you see christ say
[1:23:02] only god himself known not even the
[1:23:04] angel
[1:23:05] no wonder it was not even that's the
[1:23:08] seventh hill
[1:23:10] you see they hushed nothing taken place
[1:23:13] angel don't know it nobody knows when
[1:23:15] he's coming
[1:23:16] so at the end of the jewish
[1:23:20] seven church ages elijah comes
[1:23:23] point them to christ when christ come
[1:23:26] cross break the seals
[1:23:29] and in our time also we started with
[1:23:32] paul
[1:23:33] paul laid the foundation paul said that
[1:23:35] when i go
[1:23:37] graveyard's wolf will come the nicolet
[1:23:39] and spirit come
[1:23:40] the white house where they come the
[1:23:42] jellic the
[1:23:43] the the the
[1:23:47] what do you call a uh the palmer worm
[1:23:49] the
[1:23:50] the cake worm all those uh
[1:23:53] uh uh bats we're eating the food
[1:23:57] we're eating the tree are you there
[1:23:59] until at the end we end up with
[1:24:02] denomination we have baptist we have
[1:24:05] methodists
[1:24:06] we have catholic we have jehovah witness
[1:24:09] we have this
[1:24:10] holiness we have this and this and we
[1:24:12] are also
[1:24:13] lost that's why elijah also must
[1:24:16] come back everybody clear
[1:24:21] in the church there is uncertainty
[1:24:24] we got hundred of denominations
[1:24:27] each one saying ours is right they are
[1:24:30] no good
[1:24:31] we got it about 900 different
[1:24:34] organizations here
[1:24:36] in the united states how can they all be
[1:24:39] right now there is an
[1:24:43] uncertain sound inside in there
[1:24:45] somewhere it's not sounding right
[1:24:47] one say you come over and join our
[1:24:50] church
[1:24:50] lou leave this one and come join us and
[1:24:53] the next one say
[1:24:54] people back pack letters from church to
[1:24:58] church till they
[1:24:59] wear it out just changing the name from
[1:25:01] methodist to baptist
[1:25:03] to presbyterian to literary to
[1:25:05] pentecostal to oneness
[1:25:06] to this twinness my goodness why don't
[1:25:09] you forget it
[1:25:11] put your name under lamb's book of life
[1:25:14] revelation 10
[1:25:16] are you there in heaven you won't have
[1:25:19] to move it
[1:25:20] no more are you there once you find
[1:25:23] where christ is
[1:25:25] and you are anchored in christ you won't
[1:25:28] move
[1:25:28] anymore but the problem is baptist
[1:25:31] methodist presbyterian herodian sadducee
[1:25:35] pharisee who's talking the truth we
[1:25:37] don't know that's why
[1:25:39] elijah must come
[1:25:43] are we clear let's take john chapter 5.
[1:26:01] sometimes we get in a message we don't
[1:26:03] even understand the purpose of the
[1:26:05] message
[1:26:07] and then we don't know how to appreciate
[1:26:11] john chapter 5 verse 45 everybody there
[1:26:14] you can say amen
[1:26:15] do not think that i will accuse you this
[1:26:18] is jesus talking
[1:26:20] to the father there is one that accuses
[1:26:23] you even who
[1:26:25] so jesus when he came the jews don't
[1:26:28] want him
[1:26:28] anymore they said moses said moses said
[1:26:32] jesus look at them he said do you know
[1:26:34] who in heaven is accusing you
[1:26:37] because in heaven there is too anointed
[1:26:40] moses and elijah
[1:26:42] over there moses is the one accusing you
[1:26:46] let's go in whom you trust
[1:26:51] everybody moses gave them one law
[1:26:54] but they end up many denominations paul
[1:26:57] wrote the new testament we got one bible
[1:27:01] what do we have today baptist mentor
[1:27:03] this presbyterian pentecostal from one
[1:27:05] bible
[1:27:07] and jesus said the one who accuse you is
[1:27:10] not me
[1:27:11] it is moses who gave you the law verse
[1:27:13] 46
[1:27:14] for you for had you believed
[1:27:18] moses you would have believed
[1:27:21] for he wrote off in other words you
[1:27:24] never have faith in the law
[1:27:29] you pretend like you believe the lord
[1:27:33] if you would believe the lord the lord
[1:27:36] told you that i am
[1:27:37] coming are you there people claim
[1:27:41] we want paul we want paul we want the
[1:27:44] bible we want the bible
[1:27:45] you don't believe the bible if you
[1:27:48] believe the bible
[1:27:49] the bible spoke of malachi fowl
[1:27:55] the rejection of jesus proved
[1:27:58] that you didn't believe the law the
[1:28:01] rejection of the message of the hour
[1:28:04] proved that you don't believe the bible
[1:28:12] verse 47 but if you believe not his
[1:28:15] writing
[1:28:16] how shall you believe my word in other
[1:28:18] words
[1:28:19] you don't have confidence in the bible
[1:28:21] that's why
[1:28:22] you cannot believe the message you think
[1:28:25] oh no we need the bible we want to go to
[1:28:27] the bible
[1:28:28] you don't believe the bible because the
[1:28:30] bible spoke of the end time
[1:28:32] ministry
[1:28:36] so elijah must come and bring them back
[1:28:39] to their
[1:28:40] faith what is that faith
[1:28:46] you ready now okay brother branham
[1:28:50] notice so the scripture is strictly
[1:28:52] interpreted by itself
[1:28:55] notice he shall turn his first coming
[1:28:58] the heart of the father to his
[1:29:01] children the heart of the father to his
[1:29:05] children who's that john the baptist
[1:29:08] okay taking the old
[1:29:12] patriarch father the jews
[1:29:15] and turning their faith to this new
[1:29:19] children faith are you there
[1:29:23] because the bible says that john was
[1:29:26] fulfilling
[1:29:27] father to children but when
[1:29:30] the son of god came how many children
[1:29:33] came
[1:29:34] one are you there
[1:29:38] not many children but when jesus was
[1:29:41] teaching are you there
[1:29:45] jesus had the tendency to say
[1:29:49] except you have a faith like a leader
[1:29:55] you remember that are you there when
[1:29:58] they brought leader children
[1:30:00] and jade and the disciple begin to
[1:30:02] rebuke them
[1:30:03] jesus said don't do that for the kingdom
[1:30:06] of god
[1:30:07] of heaven is like those
[1:30:11] the faith of the father to them
[1:30:17] their faith to this new child children
[1:30:20] faith
[1:30:20] off are you there
[1:30:25] jesus coming before him i am coming
[1:30:28] before jesus in other words john is
[1:30:30] saying
[1:30:30] i came before jesus but there is one
[1:30:33] coming after
[1:30:34] me he shall baptize you with the holy
[1:30:36] ghost okay
[1:30:37] the messiah coming turning their heart
[1:30:40] everybody there away from the
[1:30:46] two
[1:30:48] are you there so john was pulling them
[1:30:51] from the lawn
[1:30:52] and said this law mess you up
[1:30:56] the law was only a temporary substitute
[1:30:59] my job is to take you back to the living
[1:31:03] god
[1:31:05] are you there and this
[1:31:08] and in his second coming he will turn
[1:31:11] the heart of the children back to the
[1:31:13] original pinnacle let's leave that first
[1:31:16] he's pulling them from the
[1:31:18] law to this this who
[1:31:21] christ why is he pulling them from the
[1:31:24] law
[1:31:25] take hebrew seven
[1:31:28] we will be wanding up sooner
[1:31:38] if you dare you can say amen everybody
[1:31:42] there
[1:31:43] hebrew chapter seven everybody there
[1:31:46] verse 11 if the
[1:31:49] if therefore what perfection
[1:31:54] whereby the levitical priesthood
[1:31:57] for under it the people received her
[1:32:00] paul is saying that the people received
[1:32:02] the law
[1:32:03] if their law could bring somebody or
[1:32:06] make somebody perfect
[1:32:10] what father need was there that another
[1:32:13] priest should rise
[1:32:14] after the order of melchizedek and not
[1:32:16] to be called after the order of aaron
[1:32:19] in other words aaron was the levitical
[1:32:21] priesthood
[1:32:23] they were working working working but
[1:32:25] god promised
[1:32:26] that i will send you a priest after the
[1:32:29] order of
[1:32:30] mercy and paul is telling them if the
[1:32:33] law was sufficient
[1:32:35] to bring you to perfection why did god
[1:32:38] open another priesthood under
[1:32:40] melchizedek
[1:32:42] in other words the opening of another
[1:32:45] priesthood
[1:32:46] was showing that the law was imperfect
[1:32:49] the law was not good enough to bring you
[1:32:53] to perfection
[1:32:55] let's go to verse 19
[1:33:00] are you there for the
[1:33:04] lord made nothing everybody
[1:33:08] clear the law made nothing perfect
[1:33:11] but bringing in air better hope
[1:33:14] did by day which we joined here too
[1:33:18] in other words their law was just to
[1:33:20] give you hope
[1:33:21] that someday the messiah will be coming
[1:33:25] are you there job to verse 23
[1:33:30] and they truly were many priests because
[1:33:33] they were not permitted to continue by
[1:33:35] reason off
[1:33:36] they were dying but this man because he
[1:33:39] continued ever
[1:33:40] has enough changeable priesthood
[1:33:44] are you there verse
[1:33:47] 25 wherefore he is able to save them to
[1:33:50] the other mosques
[1:33:52] that come to god by him seeing he ever
[1:33:54] liveth to make intercession for
[1:33:56] them for such a high priest became
[1:34:00] us who is holy homeless undefiled
[1:34:03] separated from sinner and made higher
[1:34:05] than the heaven
[1:34:06] who need no daily sacrifice in other
[1:34:09] words
[1:34:10] the law every year or after two three
[1:34:14] years
[1:34:14] the priests were dying but when jesus
[1:34:17] christ came
[1:34:18] he died he rose again jesus doesn't die
[1:34:21] anymore
[1:34:22] but when the priests were dying they
[1:34:24] were changing
[1:34:25] the priest died they changed him the
[1:34:27] high priest died the change
[1:34:28] but jesus doesn't die anymore in other
[1:34:31] words this priesthood will
[1:34:32] never change
[1:34:36] everybody clear let's jump to hebrew
[1:34:40] chapter 9 chapter 9.
[1:34:45] we are trying to find out what is faith
[1:34:47] the faith of john what is it
[1:34:50] hebrew chapter 9 verse 11 are you there
[1:34:54] but christ become a high priest of good
[1:34:56] things to come
[1:34:58] by greater and more perfect tabernacle
[1:35:01] not made with hand that is to say not of
[1:35:04] this
[1:35:05] building neither by the blood of goats
[1:35:09] and calves that's the law but by his own
[1:35:13] blood
[1:35:15] he enter in once into the holy place
[1:35:17] having obtained what
[1:35:19] eternal what redemption
[1:35:21] [Music]
[1:35:23] he doesn't go every year like the priest
[1:35:25] one time
[1:35:26] finish are you there
[1:35:30] verse 13 for if the blood of bulls and
[1:35:33] goat the lord
[1:35:34] and the ashes of the afer springling the
[1:35:37] unclean
[1:35:38] sanctify the purifying of the flesh how
[1:35:41] much more
[1:35:42] shall the blood of christ who through
[1:35:44] the eternal
[1:35:45] spirit offered himself without spot to
[1:35:48] god
[1:35:48] purge your conscience from dead work to
[1:35:51] serve the living
[1:35:52] god job to verse 26.
[1:35:57] for then must he often have suffered
[1:35:59] since the foundation of the world
[1:36:01] but now once in the end of the world has
[1:36:04] he appeared
[1:36:05] to put away remember the lamb of god
[1:36:07] that take away
[1:36:09] to put away sin by the sacrifice of what
[1:36:12] john was pulling them from the law to
[1:36:16] christ why because the law could not
[1:36:19] bring anybody
[1:36:20] perfect are you there
[1:36:24] so far we're almost there let's go to
[1:36:27] chapter 10 of hebrew
[1:36:30] now we're going to clench it everybody
[1:36:33] there
[1:36:35] i want you to read with me for the lord
[1:36:37] have a shadow off
[1:36:40] you see that it was just a shadow
[1:36:44] of good things it was just pointing you
[1:36:46] that something better is coming
[1:36:49] good things to come and not there
[1:36:52] it was not the exact thing
[1:36:55] not the very image of the thing can
[1:36:59] never everybody see that never with
[1:37:02] those sacrifice which they offer yearly
[1:37:05] continually
[1:37:06] may make their comment thereon too
[1:37:11] in other words the law can never bring
[1:37:13] you to
[1:37:14] perfection never everybody there
[1:37:18] for then would they have not
[1:37:22] ceased to be offered because the
[1:37:24] worshiper once purged
[1:37:26] should have no more conscience of sin if
[1:37:29] somebody bring the lamb
[1:37:30] they bring it to moses they lay hand on
[1:37:33] they go out and they do the same thing
[1:37:35] it was not purging the conscience are
[1:37:37] you there
[1:37:38] but in those sacrifice there is
[1:37:41] remembrance again made of sin every year
[1:37:44] for it is not possible that the blood of
[1:37:47] bulls and gold
[1:37:48] should take away what that's why john
[1:37:51] said behold the land of god that do what
[1:37:54] that's why john in other words when john
[1:37:56] said behold the lamb of god that take
[1:37:59] away sin
[1:38:00] john is pulling them from the law he's
[1:38:03] taking them out of the law
[1:38:04] saying that the blood of bulls and god
[1:38:07] can never take away
[1:38:09] sin i'm bringing you to somebody who can
[1:38:12] wipe seed away
[1:38:14] are you there verse 11
[1:38:19] and every priest stand daily ministering
[1:38:21] and offering oftentimes
[1:38:23] the same sacrifice we can which can
[1:38:27] which can never verse 11
[1:38:31] never take away do you see that
[1:38:34] never let's go to verse 18
[1:38:40] now where there is where remission of
[1:38:44] sin
[1:38:45] of this is there is no more offering for
[1:38:48] in other words christ has offered
[1:38:50] himself one time
[1:38:52] so what is that faith now
[1:38:56] this is your last scripture let's go to
[1:38:58] galatian
[1:39:02] now we understand what was john doing
[1:39:05] john was pulling them back to the
[1:39:08] fifth week first that moses spoke off
[1:39:12] are you there moses said the lord your
[1:39:14] god shall send you a
[1:39:16] prophet what verse uh galatians chapter
[1:39:19] 3 if you dare you can say amen
[1:39:22] and we will be winding
[1:39:25] verse 16. you there now
[1:39:28] to abraham and his seed where the
[1:39:31] promise made
[1:39:33] he says not and to his seeds
[1:39:36] in other words god didn't say seeds
[1:39:39] plural
[1:39:40] god says seed as singular are you there
[1:39:45] as many but as one
[1:39:48] and to your seed which is
[1:39:52] because in the back in the garden of
[1:39:55] eden the seed of the woman shall
[1:39:58] crush the head that seed was crust
[1:40:01] one seed are you there
[1:40:05] let's go down to 17. and these are
[1:40:08] saying
[1:40:08] that the covenant that was confirmed
[1:40:10] before god in christ
[1:40:12] the law which was 430 years after
[1:40:15] cannot this i know that it should make
[1:40:18] the promise of non-effect in other words
[1:40:20] the law when he came the law did not
[1:40:23] stop the promise of abraham
[1:40:25] the province of abraham was still valid
[1:40:28] but god gave the law
[1:40:30] as a temporary solution everybody there
[1:40:34] verse 18 for if the inheritance be of
[1:40:37] the law
[1:40:38] it is no more of promise but god gave it
[1:40:40] to abraham by
[1:40:42] promise wherefore then served the law
[1:40:45] paul now is showing now you say now what
[1:40:47] is the purpose of the lord and paul if
[1:40:50] you say the law was only a temporary
[1:40:51] solution
[1:40:52] so why did god send the law what
[1:40:56] then served the law he was added because
[1:40:58] of what
[1:41:00] everybody see that transgression till
[1:41:03] there should what
[1:41:06] should come to whom the promise was made
[1:41:09] and he was ordained by angel in the end
[1:41:11] of where
[1:41:12] medieval in other words paul is saying
[1:41:14] that they gave you the law
[1:41:16] as a temporary solution until christ
[1:41:19] come
[1:41:21] everybody seen that jump to verse 23 now
[1:41:27] we're trying we are talking about christ
[1:41:29] now right
[1:41:30] the law to christ watch this very
[1:41:33] carefully i don't want you to miss this
[1:41:35] if you were sleeping wake up verse 23
[1:41:39] but before faith come
[1:41:43] so faith was not there
[1:41:46] everybody clear fourth was not there
[1:41:51] are you there but before faith come
[1:41:54] who is faith remember we try to see
[1:41:57] what is fifth okay
[1:42:01] and we're gonna wind up okay he said
[1:42:04] before faith come came
[1:42:08] we were kept under though
[1:42:12] you see now we were under the law
[1:42:15] because
[1:42:16] faith did not come
[1:42:19] you see now and elijah will return the
[1:42:23] heart of the father to the fifth
[1:42:27] of the children but faith was not come
[1:42:30] here back at the camp yet
[1:42:31] then we give you the law
[1:42:34] you see now but before faith came
[1:42:38] which were kept under we were kept under
[1:42:40] the law
[1:42:41] shut up to the faith which should come
[1:42:45] which should afterward be revealed later
[1:42:48] on
[1:42:49] wherefore the law was our school master
[1:42:54] to bring us to
[1:42:57] the faith is what christ
[1:43:00] are you there that we might be justified
[1:43:04] by
[1:43:05] faith but after that faith is
[1:43:09] come which faith faith is christ
[1:43:14] are you now
[1:43:17] after that faith is come we are no
[1:43:20] longer under the
[1:43:22] school in other words we are no more
[1:43:24] living under the law
[1:43:26] are you there for all you are all
[1:43:29] children of god by faith in christ
[1:43:32] jesus
[1:43:36] everybody there for as many as you have
[1:43:40] been baptizing christ have put on christ
[1:43:43] there is neither jew no more israel
[1:43:47] no greek no more berries
[1:43:51] there is neither born nor free there is
[1:43:53] neither male nor female
[1:43:55] for you are all in christ jesus and if
[1:43:58] you be christ
[1:43:59] then you are abraham seed and heir
[1:44:02] according to the
[1:44:03] promise so elijah must come
[1:44:06] to take the faith of the jewish father
[1:44:09] and to bring them to the faith of christ
[1:44:12] because the jewish were under
[1:44:15] law until faith come which is christ
[1:44:18] and when that faith was delivered that
[1:44:21] faith
[1:44:22] never changed that's why jude said
[1:44:26] content for the faith
[1:44:29] that was once delivered to the
[1:44:33] scent and when we go
[1:44:36] throughout the the ages we lost
[1:44:39] the faith so elijah must come down
[1:44:43] to bring you back to the faith of the
[1:44:46] pentecost and the faith of the pentecost
[1:44:48] was the faith that
[1:44:50] john introduced repent be baptized
[1:44:53] and you shall be filled with the holy
[1:44:55] spirit peter comes he say repent
[1:44:58] be baptized and you shall be filled with
[1:45:00] what the holy spirit
[1:45:01] that was the faith toward the ages is
[1:45:04] lost
[1:45:05] so now they have to take the children
[1:45:07] and bring them to the faith of their
[1:45:09] father because the father were the one
[1:45:12] that gave their faith
[1:45:18] all right we're closing here the first
[1:45:20] time elijah come
[1:45:22] he turned the heart of the father the
[1:45:24] old patriarch father
[1:45:26] back there the old jews to the faith of
[1:45:29] the
[1:45:30] children that just receive him and
[1:45:33] believe on the coming
[1:45:35] messiah yeah it might not be just one
[1:45:39] person
[1:45:40] but it shall be a message in the church
[1:45:42] the holy spirit in the church
[1:45:44] to swing that faith back again to the
[1:45:46] original
[1:45:49] that's right for he will turn the heart
[1:45:51] of the children back to the father
[1:45:53] the first time he turned the heart of
[1:45:55] the father to the children
[1:45:57] this time the heart of the children to
[1:45:59] the father
[1:46:01] taking the faith that the father had in
[1:46:04] the law
[1:46:05] and placing over here on the children
[1:46:08] the one that's just them
[1:46:10] coming in into christ and this time he
[1:46:13] is to take
[1:46:14] that same faith are you there
[1:46:17] we go that's why brother branham said
[1:46:20] keep going back to the
[1:46:21] pentecostal back to the pentecostal
[1:46:24] back to the pentecostal father are you
[1:46:27] there the same faith
[1:46:28] because they got away from the original
[1:46:32] and he is god to turn fifth of the
[1:46:34] father
[1:46:35] he is going to turn the faith of the
[1:46:37] father all the children
[1:46:38] back to their father the pentecostal
[1:46:41] father another what
[1:46:44] aptitude would mean what they are
[1:46:47] pouring off their
[1:46:48] holy spirit that's why brother branham
[1:46:51] said
[1:46:51] the token could not come until the
[1:46:54] evening
[1:46:56] message because the evening message turn
[1:46:59] you back to the faith of
[1:47:00] the that's why jesus said
[1:47:04] when i shall come should i find
[1:47:07] faith
[1:47:10] are you there should i find faith with
[1:47:13] faith the faith of christ once he was
[1:47:17] established it is the eternal salvation
[1:47:20] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:47:23] and
[1:47:24] forever we left that faith on pentecost
[1:47:27] throughout the ages that faith was lost
[1:47:30] then
[1:47:30] elijah now will come take the heart of
[1:47:33] the children
[1:47:35] and send them to the faith of the father
[1:47:39] you say brother stephen the children are
[1:47:42] the children of israel
[1:47:44] that's wrong go study
[1:47:47] revelation you will see that the 144
[1:47:51] thousand are called
[1:47:52] servant study a book
[1:47:57] the children are the children of god the
[1:48:00] 144 000 are
[1:48:02] servant elijah and moses are going to
[1:48:05] bring
[1:48:06] servant not children are you there
[1:48:09] but malachi 4th we take children
[1:48:13] back to the faith of them because that
[1:48:16] faith was once delivered to the
[1:48:18] sent and jude say content fight for this
[1:48:22] faith
[1:48:23] don't let it go why because a nicolet
[1:48:26] spirit is coming in he's going to
[1:48:28] destroy that faith
[1:48:29] he's going to take away that faith
[1:48:31] through the ages until we end up
[1:48:33] into baptist methodist presbyterian
[1:48:36] this oneness twoness treatments we don't
[1:48:39] know who is right that's why
[1:48:41] elijah must come to point you back to
[1:48:43] the original
[1:48:44] faith that was the ministry of john the
[1:48:48] baptist let's turn
[1:48:54] you pray for us get 18 on sunday
[1:48:59] let's pray heavenly father
[1:49:03] lord we thank you again for your grace
[1:49:06] for your love
[1:49:07] your mercy and your blessings lord
[1:49:10] father thank you
[1:49:11] for opening our eyes to understand these
[1:49:13] things lord
[1:49:15] you spoke in your word that you are not
[1:49:17] the author of confusion
[1:49:19] confusion comes from the devil father
[1:49:22] you came
[1:49:23] to identify yourself clearly without a
[1:49:27] shadow of doubt
[1:49:28] so that our faith will not be wavering
[1:49:31] but our faith will be anchored one time
[1:49:34] on the solid rock of the revelation
[1:49:38] lord we have expressed what you put in
[1:49:40] our heart lord
[1:49:41] showing lord father the pattern of
[1:49:44] you the unchanging god lord how you
[1:49:47] started
[1:49:48] with israel how what happened in israel
[1:49:50] in the natural
[1:49:52] is exactly the repetition of the church
[1:49:55] in the spiritual lord you started with a
[1:49:57] mighty prophet by the name of moses
[1:50:00] father you gave him the law he
[1:50:02] established the house
[1:50:03] he put the foundation of of of law of
[1:50:06] law
[1:50:07] but the nicolet and spirit enter in and
[1:50:09] destroy alone
[1:50:11] but father we thank you because there is
[1:50:13] always a promise of restoration
[1:50:15] that's why you say lord that elijah will
[1:50:18] come
[1:50:18] and take the father that were already
[1:50:20] lost in the denomination of sadducees
[1:50:24] pharisees herodians publican and you
[1:50:27] brought them back to the faith
[1:50:29] that was already spoken by moses lord
[1:50:32] father
[1:50:32] which is crust the solid rock lord
[1:50:36] father that faith was delivered in the
[1:50:39] day of pentecost you are poor in the
[1:50:41] holy spirit lord
[1:50:42] and we found out that you started
[1:50:44] through a pure church
[1:50:46] and then the nicolet and spirit also
[1:50:48] ooze into the church lord
[1:50:50] and destroyed that faith lord but
[1:50:52] according to job chapter two you say
[1:50:54] that i will restore
[1:50:56] say the lord the year that the pomerol
[1:50:58] the kankaram the caterpillar
[1:51:00] have eaten you say that you will restore
[1:51:03] lord father
[1:51:04] and you send us elijah again lord to
[1:51:06] restore us
[1:51:07] back to that origin of faith bringing
[1:51:10] the genuine
[1:51:11] holy spirit back again lord father
[1:51:14] people might spoke
[1:51:16] my might say lord father that in the day
[1:51:19] of brad branham there was the
[1:51:21] pentecostal father
[1:51:22] yes in the day of john the baptist lord
[1:51:25] we found that the holy spirit also was
[1:51:27] moving through gift
[1:51:28] under simeon under anna the prophetess
[1:51:32] under many people lord but that was not
[1:51:34] the full restoration
[1:51:36] that was just the beginning of it lord
[1:51:38] all of them were still pointing towards
[1:51:40] you christ
[1:51:41] and we found in this end time lord that
[1:51:44] despite
[1:51:44] the move of the pentacles with the
[1:51:46] restoration of the gift lord
[1:51:48] there was still a message coming up
[1:51:50] praying lord
[1:51:51] praying as lord back again to christ
[1:51:54] jesus
[1:51:55] which is the message of the hour lord
[1:51:57] may we uphold and cherish this message
[1:51:59] lord
[1:52:00] father if we believe the bible there is
[1:52:02] no way lord we can reject the message
[1:52:04] rejecting the message is a sign that we
[1:52:07] never believe the bible
[1:52:08] rejecting lord father jesus was a son
[1:52:12] that the pharisee
[1:52:13] never believed the law of moses because
[1:52:15] moses
[1:52:16] spoke of you because the bible speak of
[1:52:19] this day
[1:52:19] this latter day lord before your second
[1:52:22] coming to come and take away your breath
[1:52:24] father strengthen this church lord help
[1:52:26] us lord keep
[1:52:27] us lord as we commit everything unto the
[1:52:29] hand in the name of jesus christ
[1:52:32] amen god bless you church we love you
[1:52:35] continue to pray one for another
[1:52:37] god bless you brother
[1:52:47] god bless you all how many is thankful
[1:52:51] for to be under that dispensation of
[1:52:52] grace i know

[1:52:56] we we know brother branham taught us
[1:52:59] that
[1:53:00] um brother brahm taught us that
[1:53:03] to when the prophet goes off the scene
[1:53:06] the people denominate
[1:53:07] and uh as brother shango was saying you
[1:53:09] know over the church ages we watch the
[1:53:11] people denominate get confused around
[1:53:13] the
[1:53:13] ranks of the word but that's why i took
[1:53:14] god to send us a prophet to bring back
[1:53:17] the fullness of the word
[1:53:18] and uh you know we know that god and his
[1:53:20] word are one so for us to
[1:53:22] dig into his word to get a true
[1:53:24] revelation of his word
[1:53:26] and to see you know the prophet um
[1:53:29] that you know god used to bring forth
[1:53:31] the word and have a fullness of the word
[1:53:33] that is that is how you know we can
[1:53:35] become god's bride you know we can be
[1:53:37] one with god
[1:53:38] being uh one with his word that's that's
[1:53:40] my desire i just want to learn more
[1:53:41] about his word every day of my life i
[1:53:43] want to
[1:53:43] dig in i want to grow get a greater
[1:53:45] revelation because i know like
[1:53:47] heaven and earth will pass away but he
[1:53:48] said his word will never pass away
[1:53:50] so how many of you want to be more like
[1:53:52] his word because we know that's where
[1:53:53] eternal life lies
