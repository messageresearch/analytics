[53:28] and said Lord that the people would see
[53:30] you Lord you would be high and lifted up
[53:33] no man would be visible Lord or
[53:36] remembered but Lord this service would
[53:39] be remembered for What You Do Lord in
[53:41] our midst and and may Lord we as the
[53:44] disciples who walked with you on the
[53:46] Emmaus Road Lord two thousand years ago
[53:49] Lord when they when they even before
[53:52] they knew who you really were Lord they
[53:55] were already asking you to abide with
[53:57] them Lord and to go Lord into a into a
[54:01] place that was set aside and when the
[54:03] doors were closed then you broke the
[54:05] bread and their eyes were open and so
[54:07] Lord that's our desire Lord is for you
[54:09] just to draw Lord near to us tonight
[54:12] Lord your presence be revealed with us
[54:15] Lord that we could take you Lord when we
[54:18] leave this service and Lord as we go to
[54:20] our homes and our jobs and our our
[54:23] respective places Lord that you would
[54:25] continue Lord to reveal yourself to his
[54:29] father God hallelujah we thank you Lord
[54:31] for what you have done in the day and
[54:34] hour that we live Lord there's never
[54:36] been a day like this day Lord there's
[54:39] never been a light that shines Lord and
[54:42] we're walking Lord not only walking in
[54:44] that light but we are actually becoming
[54:47] that light father God As We join to it
[54:50] so Lord may you join yourself to us now
[54:53] Lord and come Lord and do what only you
[54:55] can do we ask it in the precious name of
[54:58] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen
[55:02] amen
[55:03] Saint Luke 17 verse 22 and he said unto
[55:07] the disciples
[55:09] the days will come
[55:12] when ye shall desire to see one of the
[55:15] days of the son of man and ye shall not
[55:19] see it
[55:20] and they shall say to you see here
[55:24] or see there
[55:26] go not after them nor follow them for as
[55:30] the lightning that lightneth out of the
[55:32] one part under Heaven shineth unto the
[55:35] other part under heaven
[55:37] so shall also the son of man be in his
[55:41] day
[55:41] but first he must suffer many things and
[55:46] be rejected of this generation
[55:50] and as it was in the days of Noah so
[55:54] shall it be also in the days of the son
[55:57] of man so he's giving them this as it
[56:00] was so shall it be
[56:02] amen they did eat they drank they
[56:04] married wives they were given in
[56:06] marriage until the day that Noah entered
[56:09] into the ark and the flood came and
[56:11] destroyed them all likewise also as it
[56:14] was in the days of lot they did eat they
[56:17] drink they bought they sold they planted
[56:19] they built it but the same day that lot
[56:22] went out of Sodom it reigned fire and
[56:25] brimstone from heaven and destroyed them
[56:29] all
[56:30] even thus
[56:31] shall it be
[56:33] in the day
[56:35] the day when the son of man
[56:39] is revealed
[56:41] may the Lord bless the reading of his
[56:43] word we could dismiss the service right
[56:45] there amen because amen there's never
[56:49] been a day like this day because we
[56:52] don't look at this scripture now as
[56:54] something off in the future
[56:56] but it's something that we have lived to
[56:59] see the very fulfillment of amen and I
[57:02] want to say this tonight regardless of
[57:04] what Satan might have done amen with the
[57:07] truths that have been revealed in this
[57:09] hour amen there are still they are key
[57:13] foundational principles amen that have
[57:16] been restored to us Amen to join us into
[57:19] a perfect relationship with Jesus Christ
[57:22] the revealed word of the hour
[57:25] and so the revealing of the son of man
[57:27] is to me amen one of the greatest keys
[57:31] to recognizing what God did amen 2000
[57:36] years ago what God has done in this
[57:39] generation through the ministry of
[57:41] Malachi 4 and the Fulfillment of Saint
[57:44] Luke 17 30 but not only that but what
[57:47] God is doing even now
[57:49] and today now you remember I believe
[57:52] it's in Matthew 16 where Jesus called
[57:54] his disciples and he said whom do men
[57:57] say that I am and then he said whom do
[57:59] you say that I am and Peter spoke those
[58:02] words Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[58:05] Living God and Jesus said blessed art
[58:08] thou Simon barjona flesh and blood not
[58:11] even my own person not even my own
[58:14] presence with you has revealed this to
[58:16] you but my Father which is in heaven and
[58:20] Upon This Rock upon this basis
[58:23] I will build my church and the Gates of
[58:27] Hell shall not Prevail against it so it
[58:32] is that principle it is that rock of
[58:34] Revelation amen that every man woman or
[58:37] child amen that is Born Into the kingdom
[58:40] of God is born under that same basis
[58:42] amen there's a revelation given to them
[58:45] by the Holy Spirit of who Jesus Christ
[58:49] is
[58:51] the revealed word of the hour not of a
[58:54] previous age not of a future age but
[58:57] right here right now and that revelation
[59:01] took Peter to the upper room
[59:04] in obedience to Jesus words until the
[59:08] prophecy that Jesus gave him expressed
[59:11] itself and then Peter himself amen
[59:14] became an extension of Jesus own
[59:16] Ministry his own body manifested here in
[59:19] the Earth
[59:21] amen
[59:22] so if you miss this
[59:25] you can see it all you can you can
[59:27] believe it all carnally or
[59:30] intellectually but you will still wind
[59:32] up in idolatry you will either be
[59:35] worshiping the vessel that the son of
[59:38] man was revealed in much like
[59:40] Nebuchadnezzar was doing in his day amen
[59:43] or you will fail to see what God has
[59:46] done which will bring amen a reproach
[59:49] amen amen it will actually be looking
[59:52] off for something to happen out in the
[59:54] future amen when God has already
[59:55] fulfilled it
[59:57] amen so it'll take the emphasis away
[59:59] from Christ and put it off on something
[1:00:02] else
[1:00:03] amen so I I've been listening to the
[1:00:06] message the Masterpiece and if you hear
[1:00:09] Brother Branham he's talking about amen
[1:00:11] how he got the inspiration for this he
[1:00:13] had gone out to I believe the the
[1:00:15] Angelus Temple had seen the uh replica
[1:00:18] of the the Masterpiece of Michelangelo
[1:00:20] the sculptor Moses with the the part of
[1:00:24] his knee missing there and he said I
[1:00:26] believe the flaw is what made it a
[1:00:29] masterpiece amen but he said notice the
[1:00:32] flaw is what was removed from the
[1:00:35] original amen and so then he talks about
[1:00:37] how God had a masterpiece family in Eden
[1:00:41] amen which was the expression of himself
[1:00:45] in humanity I mean every other creature
[1:00:48] even the animal kingdom amen it was not
[1:00:51] a complete revelation of God until he
[1:00:54] had a son standing on the Earth First in
[1:00:58] a spirit being and then God formed him
[1:01:01] into a body of flesh made out of the 16
[1:01:03] elements of the earth and God breathed
[1:01:06] into him the breath of life and Earth
[1:01:08] had a god
[1:01:11] Earth had a a man over it with dominion
[1:01:15] over every sphere of the Earth
[1:01:19] God had a son in His image amen who
[1:01:24] could express the thoughts of God and
[1:01:27] could speak creation Amen to call the
[1:01:30] Animals by their names could place them
[1:01:32] could restore the order to the Garden
[1:01:34] that's exactly right amen and so then
[1:01:37] God wasn't finished revealing his
[1:01:39] mystery
[1:01:40] because that manifested attribute was
[1:01:43] lonely he was looking for a way to
[1:01:47] extend his life that's right to
[1:01:49] reproduce his life and when God made
[1:01:52] Adam amen into a a second fold amen or a
[1:01:57] further expression he did not go reach
[1:01:59] back into the Earth
[1:02:01] no sir
[1:02:02] he did not reach into the Earth
[1:02:04] he reached into Adam
[1:02:08] Hallelujah
[1:02:09] showing you who the bride is made of she
[1:02:13] is not made up of pollen substance she
[1:02:16] is made from him yes sir
[1:02:19] she is the further part the further
[1:02:22] revelation of who Christ is which
[1:02:25] enables him to multiply himself
[1:02:28] in a mini-membered body on the Earth
[1:02:33] preach my brother but after that
[1:02:35] Masterpiece fell
[1:02:37] God set out to build another masterpiece
[1:02:41] and so he talked about the prophets
[1:02:43] Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph right and
[1:02:46] then he said he come over to the
[1:02:47] prophets and I'm picking this up in
[1:02:49] paragraph 70 of the Masterpiece he said
[1:02:52] all the prophets had flaws
[1:02:55] all the ones was a portion but speaking
[1:02:59] of Christ but here at last coming up
[1:03:02] through that right finally comes the
[1:03:05] Masterpiece amen the perfect one no
[1:03:09] fault in him at all
[1:03:12] he's so perfect reflected of the Builder
[1:03:15] himself
[1:03:17] his own image was reflected in his work
[1:03:21] amen God and Christ were one that's it
[1:03:25] in so much until he put his own Spirit
[1:03:29] into him amen and then even the image in
[1:03:34] the Builder
[1:03:35] become one
[1:03:38] so there was no difference
[1:03:41] between God and Christ
[1:03:43] because God was in Christ
[1:03:47] reconciling the world to himself even if
[1:03:52] and if I may just elaborate on that he
[1:03:55] was not reconciling the cosmos
[1:03:58] he was not reconciling pilate or Herod
[1:04:01] or Pharisees or Sadducees but he was
[1:04:05] reconciling the portions of the earth
[1:04:09] that had the book not been forfeited by
[1:04:12] Adam Adam would have called those names
[1:04:15] from the earth as the expressed
[1:04:18] attributes of God's family
[1:04:21] so the second Adam is coming to
[1:04:23] reconcile or redeem back
[1:04:27] those attributes those names that were
[1:04:31] in the Lamb's Book of Life for the
[1:04:33] foundation of the world
[1:04:35] amen amen so even the image and the
[1:04:39] Builder became one amen God in his
[1:04:42] sculpture work his masterpiece when
[1:04:45] Moses was in the work of of Michelangelo
[1:04:48] a sculpture work that was dead
[1:04:51] because it had been made out of stone
[1:04:54] but here
[1:04:56] and I'm titling this message tonight
[1:04:58] when God stepped in amen
[1:05:02] amen when God stepped in
[1:05:06] because he says here when the master
[1:05:09] builder when he got his handiwork
[1:05:13] perfected right
[1:05:15] he stepped into it
[1:05:19] hey man
[1:05:21] Michelangelo is so inspired when he saw
[1:05:24] what was in his mind born before his
[1:05:28] very eyes he struck the image and he
[1:05:31] said speak but the image couldn't answer
[1:05:34] the image couldn't respond amen but he
[1:05:37] said when this master builder even had
[1:05:40] something in his own very image he
[1:05:43] stepped into it
[1:05:45] amen
[1:05:47] so perfected a redeemer of man yes yes
[1:05:50] so perfect so Godly yet there was no
[1:05:53] Beauty we should desire it amen
[1:05:56] I've preached on that before he was
[1:05:58] saving that for Mrs
[1:06:01] Jesus Christ that's right
[1:06:03] you know in every other creature of the
[1:06:05] male was the most beautiful but in the
[1:06:07] one that God Made In His Image the more
[1:06:10] beautiful expression was contained as a
[1:06:12] mystery
[1:06:13] until she was birthed fourth amen amen
[1:06:18] when this virgin born son of the Living
[1:06:20] God became so perfect and humble and in
[1:06:23] the image of god Till The Great Master
[1:06:26] who had brought his life up through the
[1:06:28] prophets and he would see the fulfilling
[1:06:31] of all the prophets he was so perfect
[1:06:33] until God's seeing this he smote him
[1:06:36] amen he smoked him at Calvary he smote
[1:06:39] him and he cried out speak amen as
[1:06:43] Michelangelo did speak amen
[1:06:46] now here's just a few illustrations of
[1:06:48] this because we had a pre-figure yes sir
[1:06:50] of this when a man by the name of uh
[1:06:54] Abram
[1:06:55] got a call from God one day
[1:06:58] a heathen worshiper a root worshiper an
[1:07:01] idol amen just like all of his ancestors
[1:07:03] but God spoke to him said Abraham I have
[1:07:05] purposed and determined Amen to bring
[1:07:09] you
[1:07:10] to this expected End Amen I have called
[1:07:14] you amen separate yourself from your
[1:07:17] Kindred get you out from this country
[1:07:19] unto a land that I will show thee amen
[1:07:21] amen and to prove that this was
[1:07:25] representation that God had placed into
[1:07:28] Abraham by for ordination Abraham obeyed
[1:07:31] him
[1:07:33] see that's the proof it's not in the
[1:07:35] hearing but in the obey
[1:07:38] and being compelled by this voice that
[1:07:42] is speaking Hallelujah yes Abraham set
[1:07:45] out on a journey amen amen and God told
[1:07:49] him as you obey me and as You Follow Me
[1:07:51] I'm gonna unfold these promises and
[1:07:55] these blessings in your life in spite of
[1:07:58] yourself Amen in spite of your
[1:08:01] weaknesses in spite of the lies you tell
[1:08:03] or how backslane you become I have
[1:08:06] already determined it and if you can
[1:08:08] just have faith in who I am yes I will
[1:08:12] perform this in your life
[1:08:16] amen so here's Abraham decades later
[1:08:19] and it's him and Sarah in what 90 some
[1:08:22] year old bodies way up here on the back
[1:08:24] side of the desert there's been all
[1:08:25] these separations and things and lots
[1:08:28] down there in the well-watered plains of
[1:08:29] Sodom
[1:08:31] and so one day a man after many years of
[1:08:35] conditioning
[1:08:36] you see that's what people Miss that's
[1:08:39] right God don't just pour blessings on
[1:08:41] you he conditions you
[1:08:44] [Applause]
[1:08:46] Prince
[1:08:48] he conditions you
[1:08:50] to prepare you amen for royalty and
[1:08:55] divine attributes to be expressed in
[1:08:59] your life
[1:09:00] amen so Abraham and Sarah were separated
[1:09:04] they were segregated back on the back
[1:09:06] side of the desert amen seemed like no
[1:09:09] Prosperity amen everything was hard
[1:09:11] everything was difficult lot was down
[1:09:14] there amen of Sodom amen he was accepted
[1:09:17] he was beloved amen he was in the Inner
[1:09:20] Circle he had the favor amen but Abraham
[1:09:23] got a visit one day
[1:09:25] Hallelujah
[1:09:27] because God yes yes Jehovah yes came
[1:09:31] down from The Eternity yes and he took
[1:09:35] 16 elements and blew three bodies
[1:09:40] three bodies
[1:09:43] and then he took one of those bodies and
[1:09:48] he stepped into it yes my brother
[1:09:51] Hallelujah and went Elohim when
[1:09:55] Melchizedek yes stepped into a body of
[1:09:58] Flesh yes my brother he did not go to
[1:10:00] Sodom Hallelujah he did not go to the
[1:10:03] World Council of churches
[1:10:05] he did not preach repentance without the
[1:10:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost he did not
[1:10:12] preach Prosperity he did not go to the
[1:10:15] nerve centers in the main channels his
[1:10:18] message was to a call out yes Abraham
[1:10:22] and Sarah yes
[1:10:24] I have come to perform the promise in
[1:10:28] your life amen
[1:10:30] hallelujah God
[1:10:34] stepped into a body of Flesh amen the
[1:10:37] revealing of the son of man yes my
[1:10:40] brother he turned his back to the title
[1:10:42] yes why did Sarah laugh
[1:10:46] Hallelujah yes sir giving us a sign
[1:10:50] showing us again that just before
[1:10:54] Sodom Burns amen there's going to change
[1:10:59] Hallelujah yes my brother and the
[1:11:02] permissive yes it's gonna be transformed
[1:11:04] into the perfect yes without that in a
[1:11:08] moment in a twinkling of an eye yes we
[1:11:11] will be changed and joined to meet him
[1:11:14] in the air amen
[1:11:17] oh we could have church in here tonight
[1:11:19] amen amen and then there was a time amen
[1:11:23] when Nebuchadnezzar with his Heathen
[1:11:25] mind had decided God had incarnated
[1:11:28] himself in a prophet messenger and
[1:11:31] Nebuchadnezzar said I will I I I believe
[1:11:34] this God
[1:11:37] well why wouldn't you believe it after
[1:11:39] all he had suffered
[1:11:41] I believe this God and now everybody's
[1:11:44] going to bow to him
[1:11:45] and I'm going to erect an an idol in the
[1:11:48] image of the prophet
[1:11:50] and force everybody to Bow and worship
[1:11:55] and it was going over so good
[1:11:58] with only three exceptions
[1:12:01] [Music]
[1:12:04] the man who knew Daniel the best
[1:12:08] refused to worship Him
[1:12:12] because they didn't just know Daniel
[1:12:16] they knew that God
[1:12:18] of Daniel
[1:12:20] and they said we will not bow amen it
[1:12:26] doesn't matter what you say what you
[1:12:28] threaten what you try to do we will not
[1:12:31] bow amen we would rather face the threat
[1:12:35] of death
[1:12:36] then bow
[1:12:38] and he said and you know and I've
[1:12:40] preached on this before he said well you
[1:12:41] know fellas we'll give you a second
[1:12:43] chance we'll give you a second chance
[1:12:45] we'll do this all again tomorrow and and
[1:12:47] then and they said no we don't need a
[1:12:49] second chance
[1:12:50] it doesn't matter how many times it
[1:12:52] happens we ain't gonna do it
[1:12:54] and he said well I'm gonna throw you in
[1:12:55] the fire furnaces well you you you know
[1:12:59] what you got to do we know what we gotta
[1:13:01] do we need power
[1:13:04] and God was so impressed yes my brother
[1:13:08] with the stand and the conviction yes
[1:13:12] and the result yes sir of these three
[1:13:15] men yes that when Gabriel and Michael
[1:13:18] and wormwood and all these Mighty Angels
[1:13:20] stepped up to the throne and said we'll
[1:13:22] go down God we'll blow out the fire
[1:13:24] we'll we'll we'll uh we'll extinguish
[1:13:27] the fire we'll do all these things we'll
[1:13:29] we'll you know we'll intervene God said
[1:13:30] no you won't
[1:13:32] they didn't stand for y'all
[1:13:35] standing for me amen and then God
[1:13:39] stepped in
[1:13:42] [Applause]
[1:13:43] Hallelujah friend don't you turn around
[1:13:46] don't you go back don't you be scared of
[1:13:49] what lies ahead of you you just keep on
[1:13:52] walking and watch those chains fell off
[1:13:54] watch those bonds fall off of you even
[1:13:58] your tormentors will die yes sir but God
[1:14:01] will meet you in the fire amen he
[1:14:05] stepped in
[1:14:06] amen
[1:14:08] when 120 believers
[1:14:11] obeyed his instructions
[1:14:14] and carried in the upper room until they
[1:14:19] were endued
[1:14:20] right with power from on high he stepped
[1:14:24] in that's it
[1:14:26] now there's a body
[1:14:29] that has been formed from 16 elements
[1:14:32] yes sir that are tearing in the upper
[1:14:34] room until
[1:14:37] he steps in amen
[1:14:39] this is the revealing of the son of man
[1:14:45] not in one man
[1:14:47] but in many members that's it
[1:14:50] that's it so much so you've heard me
[1:14:52] preach on it before
[1:14:53] Saul Saul why persecute us thou me
[1:14:57] never had met Jesus in the flesh but the
[1:15:01] voice said you're persecuting me
[1:15:03] because he was now incarnate yes in the
[1:15:08] Spirit-filled believer
[1:15:12] amen
[1:15:13] when the Holy Ghost is come yes to speak
[1:15:17] against it will never be forgiven in
[1:15:19] this life
[1:15:21] amen
[1:15:23] oh my
[1:15:25] when the church
[1:15:27] was being compromised by men trying to
[1:15:32] make the word of God of none effect
[1:15:36] by forming Creeds and dogmas based on
[1:15:40] traditions and carnal interpretations of
[1:15:45] his word right
[1:15:46] he stepped in
[1:15:48] amen
[1:15:50] and he said if an angel from heaven
[1:15:53] right
[1:15:54] preach any other thing amen then that
[1:15:57] which I have preached amen let him be a
[1:15:59] curse amen was that a man
[1:16:02] or was that God
[1:16:04] pray tonight
[1:16:05] was that a man or was that God
[1:16:09] was he just another religious scholar or
[1:16:13] was Christ
[1:16:14] amen personifying himself in a prophet
[1:16:18] messenger that's it that's it in the
[1:16:20] latter days
[1:16:22] he was a prophet I don't care what any
[1:16:25] unbeliever says that man had a prophetic
[1:16:28] Ministry amen but you see a prophetic
[1:16:31] Ministry can only attract the attention
[1:16:34] of a prophetic class yes my brother of
[1:16:38] people
[1:16:39] and they are drawn to that prophetic
[1:16:42] Ministry like a magnet where they not
[1:16:46] only believe the prophecy but they
[1:16:48] become
[1:16:50] they become a fulfillment of that
[1:16:55] prophetic Ministry
[1:16:58] amen
[1:17:00] we see it in Revelation Seven Stars
[1:17:03] in the right hand of Jehovah
[1:17:06] light Hallelujah to each of the ages oh
[1:17:11] my arise and shine for thy light has
[1:17:15] come
[1:17:16] you don't just receive light you become
[1:17:19] light amen amen you become a prism and
[1:17:23] the light is expressing itself through
[1:17:25] Hallelujah yes sir amen yes my brother
[1:17:28] Hallelujah
[1:17:30] so in each age in each of these seven
[1:17:33] distinct ages he appointed a mouthpiece
[1:17:38] amen see he struck the image and said
[1:17:40] speak
[1:17:41] right you're not just there to look
[1:17:43] pretty
[1:17:44] you're there to do something
[1:17:47] you there to manifest
[1:17:49] the desires of the sculptor amen he
[1:17:53] formed you a man to Pur to to to do
[1:17:57] something to express something to
[1:17:59] fulfill something yes and so here he is
[1:18:02] in each of the ages yes giving his word
[1:18:05] amen amen because God's spoken word is
[1:18:09] one of the greatest expressions of his
[1:18:11] power amen amen
[1:18:15] amen amen
[1:18:18] Jesus
[1:18:19] Jesus himself we read it tonight we read
[1:18:22] it in Saint Luke 17 prophesied
[1:18:26] prophesied a return of his very person
[1:18:29] yes my brother the revealing of the son
[1:18:33] of man
[1:18:34] right before the end of the Fallen World
[1:18:38] Order yes
[1:18:40] Satan's Eden
[1:18:42] I'm just as
[1:18:43] Satan crept into godzine
[1:18:47] and defiled it
[1:18:49] God has crept into Satan's Eden
[1:18:52] and restored his very Kingdom amen
[1:18:58] Hallelujah
[1:19:03] see before a fallen Eden yes could be
[1:19:06] restored
[1:19:07] a fallen Adam
[1:19:09] had to be restored
[1:19:11] because Eden didn't fall until Adam
[1:19:14] failed that's exactly right so Eden
[1:19:18] cannot be restored amen until Adam comes
[1:19:21] back amen to his original position amen
[1:19:25] and when a manifested son and daughter
[1:19:28] of God yes come back amen into their
[1:19:31] position that's everything else will
[1:19:33] fall into order amen amen everything
[1:19:36] else will recognize there's a manifested
[1:19:38] son there's a manifested daughter amen
[1:19:41] Satan will have to dispatch three to do
[1:19:43] what one used to could do
[1:19:45] because that's a manifested son they're
[1:19:48] in their position yes sir there is
[1:19:50] nothing beyond their reach
[1:19:52] because they become the very extension
[1:19:55] of God's power his thoughts his Dominion
[1:19:58] everything is channeling right through
[1:20:01] that predestinated believer amen because
[1:20:03] they're standing right there in their
[1:20:04] position and Satan cannot budge them
[1:20:07] and their position brother and sister is
[1:20:09] behind the revealed word of the hour
[1:20:11] that's it which is their fortification
[1:20:13] yes which is their protection which is
[1:20:16] what Eve stepped out from behind but now
[1:20:18] the believer won't budge
[1:20:21] if they have to change churches they'll
[1:20:23] change churches but they're not
[1:20:24] departing from that revealed word amen
[1:20:27] change pastors change friends change
[1:20:29] jobs whatever it takes amen they
[1:20:33] recognize
[1:20:34] I must stay in this position amen amen
[1:20:39] else I become captive
[1:20:41] I become subject to Satan's power amen
[1:20:45] same thing Jesus did it's also written
[1:20:49] Satan yes sir amen he didn't have to use
[1:20:51] his his powers he just used the word
[1:20:54] that's it because every time Satan
[1:20:57] brings the words out of context that's
[1:20:58] exactly right that's exactly right
[1:21:01] because Satan cannot have a revelation
[1:21:03] he only has carnal understanding that's
[1:21:06] which he tries to twist
[1:21:09] to his own benefit
[1:21:11] but when the full context of the word is
[1:21:13] given in Revelation amen it puts Satan
[1:21:16] in his place
[1:21:18] Hallelujah
[1:21:22] so a restored Eden will follow a
[1:21:26] restored Adam
[1:21:28] is there is there is there disorder in
[1:21:30] the home
[1:21:31] there's an atom out of his place
[1:21:33] [Music]
[1:21:34] there's a Mrs Adam preacher out of place
[1:21:38] when there's chaos when there's disorder
[1:21:41] somebody's not in their position amen
[1:21:43] somebody's preached forfeited their
[1:21:46] prayer life that's right amen somebody
[1:21:48] has put their job over the house of God
[1:21:50] that's it amen somebody has put the the
[1:21:52] bills over the tithes that's it
[1:21:55] something that's out of position yes and
[1:21:58] so the kingdom is crumbling that's right
[1:22:00] but when everything is back in its place
[1:22:03] yes sir God wraps his protection around
[1:22:07] that hope that marriage that family
[1:22:10] Hallelujah and it is an end defensible
[1:22:13] Fortress Satan cannot put a child amen
[1:22:17] amen amen oh if the church only knew its
[1:22:20] position one day it will and then the
[1:22:23] Rapture will go
[1:22:25] Hallelujah
[1:22:26] [Music]
[1:22:28] could not have
[1:22:30] oh my
[1:22:32] can't have a restored Eden without a
[1:22:35] restored Adam
[1:22:36] hey
[1:22:38] hey you can't have a restored Adam
[1:22:40] without a restored Eve
[1:22:47] one will follow the other
[1:22:50] [Applause]
[1:22:51] and we've had a restored Adam
[1:22:54] for 2 000 years
[1:22:56] do you know the prophet of God says in
[1:22:58] many places
[1:22:59] everything that the first Adam forfeited
[1:23:02] that's the second Adam restored that's
[1:23:04] exactly right the problem is Satan keeps
[1:23:08] displacing
[1:23:09] the believer God call him back to the
[1:23:11] word and then Satan will pushed him away
[1:23:13] until
[1:23:16] Masterpiece time yes
[1:23:19] yes my brother
[1:23:20] so I want to say this tonight amen
[1:23:23] the revealing of the son of man yes is
[1:23:27] not to exalt or lift up the man
[1:23:32] but is to display Christ
[1:23:36] en redeemed attributes amen the very
[1:23:40] expression of God's life amen in an
[1:23:44] Earthly family amen the extension of God
[1:23:48] or the expansion of his kingdom amen
[1:23:52] amen amen through his first restored
[1:23:57] Adam Christ amen we know who that is
[1:23:59] right you've been taught well
[1:24:01] he redeemed and resurrected his family
[1:24:04] amen we had a resurrection
[1:24:08] when the first Adam raised
[1:24:11] he didn't rise alone no
[1:24:13] his Mrs Adam
[1:24:16] raised with him amen
[1:24:19] amen Abraham raised with him
[1:24:22] Sarah raised with me job raised with him
[1:24:25] amen Joseph raised with him all of that
[1:24:28] Old Testament bride rose with Adam Amen
[1:24:32] to be recognized in the resurrection
[1:24:35] showing that I mean he is the head and
[1:24:39] all of the attention is on him that's
[1:24:41] right but he came amen not for his own
[1:24:44] Redemption
[1:24:46] but for the Redemption of its attributes
[1:24:49] amen amen so if he had raised without
[1:24:51] them it would have been an empty
[1:24:53] Resurrection
[1:24:55] it would not have actually been
[1:24:57] the validation
[1:24:59] or the Vindication of his ministry
[1:25:02] because the Vindication wasn't just his
[1:25:05] own Resurrection
[1:25:06] but it was what job saw
[1:25:09] it was what David were told it was what
[1:25:12] Isaiah
[1:25:14] he raised those prophets with him to say
[1:25:18] they had the saith the Lord amen no I
[1:25:22] had thus saith the Lord amen and every
[1:25:24] believer who received
[1:25:28] that prophet's message
[1:25:31] yes sir is recognized with him amen
[1:25:35] [Applause]
[1:25:37] yes my brother
[1:25:39] yes brother yes why are we shouting
[1:25:42] because this is not a 2 000 year old
[1:25:46] event
[1:25:47] it is a present-day rapture
[1:25:52] if I be lifted up I will draw all men
[1:25:57] into myself
[1:25:59] Hallelujah you are not feeding on a man
[1:26:02] you are feeding on the unfailing body
[1:26:06] word of the son of man yes sir
[1:26:09] Hallelujah
[1:26:12] Hallelujah
[1:26:14] they're recognizing it
[1:26:16] you talk about a woke
[1:26:19] you talk about an Awakening
[1:26:23] brother Brennan's day
[1:26:25] you talking about coming out of the
[1:26:26] closet
[1:26:28] time for the True Believer
[1:26:30] to come out of the closet
[1:26:33] and declare themselves
[1:26:36] we'd have anything to be ashamed of
[1:26:39] amen amen amen amen
[1:26:45] recognized yes sir with him amen so
[1:26:49] oh
[1:26:51] y'all are following y'all are following
[1:26:53] y'all are following a man yes
[1:26:56] you're following uh of a false prophet
[1:27:01] they only knew
[1:27:03] we're we're not just following him
[1:27:07] we're following what he was following
[1:27:09] that's it
[1:27:14] Moses was following the pillar of fire
[1:27:16] amen
[1:27:18] and the pillar of fire didn't leave
[1:27:21] when Moses was taken off the scene
[1:27:25] the pillar of fire continued amen and
[1:27:28] the joshuas and the calebs
[1:27:30] continue to follow amen the pillar of
[1:27:34] fire amen amen if if Moses was the focal
[1:27:39] point
[1:27:40] then you would form a circle around the
[1:27:43] grave
[1:27:43] [Music]
[1:27:45] or or let me say this where Moses was
[1:27:49] last known to be
[1:27:53] looking for his return no
[1:27:59] no but if you were following what Moses
[1:28:01] was following
[1:28:03] you would know that Moses message and
[1:28:06] Ministry amen
[1:28:08] was to complete a phase
[1:28:10] of The Exodus but the FED The Exodus
[1:28:14] wasn't over
[1:28:15] at Moses departure The Exodus was going
[1:28:19] on amen amen now personified is a
[1:28:24] different leader yes but with followers
[1:28:26] amen Abu had been born in the wilderness
[1:28:29] and were determined Amen to go all the
[1:28:33] way
[1:28:33] amen
[1:28:37] so the revealing of the son of man is to
[1:28:40] display Christ amen redeemed attributes
[1:28:45] oh my I just just lost my place there
[1:28:48] somehow talking about
[1:28:50] you know Satan the the greatest the
[1:28:52] greatest thing a Believer can come to is
[1:28:55] a revelation of who they are that's
[1:28:56] exactly what the Holy Spirit just
[1:28:59] brought it back to me
[1:29:00] in brother branham's day the voice of
[1:29:04] healing newsletter magazine fast pray
[1:29:08] fast pray God send us a prophet and
[1:29:11] brother Ben said they fail to see they
[1:29:15] fail to recognize the Awakening
[1:29:20] of the Bride amen
[1:29:22] amen amen amen that's what we're
[1:29:25] shouting about amen amen
[1:29:29] amen so through his first restored Adam
[1:29:33] Christ
[1:29:34] he redeemed and resurrected his family
[1:29:38] through the Omega revealing let's
[1:29:43] see yeah
[1:29:45] we're told
[1:29:48] Raul that's
[1:29:50] not that revealing that's exactly right
[1:29:54] of the same son of man Ministry amen but
[1:29:58] it would be later yes sir it would be in
[1:30:01] the future yes sir and I'm calling it
[1:30:04] The Omega because it is a repeat of the
[1:30:08] alpha but it is not in infancy no no it
[1:30:13] is not an infant Acts 2 38
[1:30:17] Pentecostal baby
[1:30:19] although it is born the same way
[1:30:24] Upon This Rock he never changes the way
[1:30:28] but this church is born now in the
[1:30:31] latter H amen as the Capstone amen
[1:30:36] hallelujah yes the last level of the
[1:30:39] pyramid yes sir
[1:30:41] to perfectly match yes my brother
[1:30:45] the Masterpiece amen Christ amen
[1:30:48] hallelujah you can see what I'm saying
[1:30:53] and so through the Omega revealing
[1:30:57] he'll raise up his new testament body
[1:30:59] amen and return to Earth yes sir to
[1:31:03] Rapture them amen
[1:31:05] my
[1:31:08] amen

[1:31:18] the anointed ones at the end time yes
[1:31:20] July 25th
[1:31:24] 1965. yes sir
[1:31:25] end of the message paragraph 365. you
[1:31:29] might have thought today
[1:31:32] that I was trying to say that about
[1:31:35] myself
[1:31:36] being that I was packing this message
[1:31:40] I have no more to do with it I then
[1:31:44] nothing no more than just a voice that's
[1:31:48] it that's it
[1:31:51] sounds to me like
[1:31:53] somebody smote the masterpiece
[1:31:55] and said speak
[1:32:03] I have no more to do with it than
[1:32:06] nothing
[1:32:07] no more than just a voice yes sir and my
[1:32:11] voice against my better judgment I want
[1:32:15] it to be a Trapper but it's the will of
[1:32:18] my father that's it that I declare to do
[1:32:22] and I am determined to do amen amen and
[1:32:26] I want to say that tonight amen by the
[1:32:28] grace of God I don't care what anybody
[1:32:30] says about it or thinks about it it is
[1:32:33] the will of my father
[1:32:35] that I am determined to do
[1:32:38] I will cross any sea on any Desert any
[1:32:41] mountain or any Valley When God says go
[1:32:44] I'm going that's it when God says speak
[1:32:46] I'm speaking
[1:32:48] amen if they should hold their peace the
[1:32:52] rocks will cry out but when you
[1:32:55] recognize that his King Messiah
[1:32:59] coming down that mountain you begin to
[1:33:02] praise you begin to cry out you begin to
[1:33:05] recognize
[1:33:07] my healing that's my salvation that's my
[1:33:11] body change that's my Rapture you are
[1:33:15] recognizing your headship
[1:33:18] the revealed word of the hour Hallelujah
[1:33:24] it's the countdown for the bride
[1:33:27] the countdown before liftoff
[1:33:29] oh my I I could preach here for just a
[1:33:33] moment
[1:33:33] I I love flight I love Aviation I I've
[1:33:38] flown planes I've got about eight hours
[1:33:40] uh flying a Cessna I love it I just
[1:33:44] can't afford it
[1:33:47] it's very expensive
[1:33:49] but my dad
[1:33:50] when I was a child he would subscribe to
[1:33:53] the air in space magazine
[1:33:56] from the Smithsonian
[1:33:58] and every once in a while they would
[1:33:59] have a magazine and they would feature
[1:34:01] the space shuttle
[1:34:03] now this back years ago
[1:34:05] you know they have the Challenger and
[1:34:07] and the discovery and they had all these
[1:34:08] space shuttles but they would show the
[1:34:10] cockpit
[1:34:11] the cockpit or the command center inside
[1:34:14] the the shuttle as it was standing on
[1:34:17] the launch pad in Cape Canaveral amen
[1:34:20] hours before the launch or days before
[1:34:22] the launch and inside I mean there's all
[1:34:25] kinds of buttons and screens and levers

[1:37:06] as they are
[1:37:07] I'm only one that's near when he does it
[1:37:12] I was only a voice
[1:37:14] that he used to say it
[1:37:18] it wasn't what I knew
[1:37:21] it's what I just surrendered myself to
[1:37:24] that he spoke through
[1:37:30] it wasn't me
[1:37:32] it wasn't the seventh angel
[1:37:35] shows you
[1:37:37] the revealing of the son of man is
[1:37:39] another element
[1:37:41] to the seventh Angels Ministry many
[1:37:44] recognize his prophetic role in the
[1:37:47] scriptures but they missed who he
[1:37:50] introduced
[1:37:53] [Music]
[1:37:55] in other words they would cling cling to
[1:37:58] John after Christ
[1:38:01] was introduced

[1:38:06] predestinated left John and followed

[1:38:14] resurrection and under Pentecost and
[1:38:16] afterwards hallelujah
[1:38:19] hallelujah they appreciated what John

[1:45:44] spirit amen because the the material is
[1:45:48] a derivative

[1:47:49] speak the word glory amen
[1:47:51] prepare to close tonight
[1:47:53] they were telling me I saw that this is
[1:47:55] spoken word Tabernacle is that right is
[1:47:58] that the name of this church
[1:48:00] yes sir yes spoken word Tabernacle
[1:48:08] when he stepped in
[1:48:14] spoken word Tabernacle yes my brother
[1:48:17] that's not this building
[1:48:20] that's the vessel
[1:48:22] it's a tabernacle
[1:48:25] for the spoken word to find betting
[1:48:28] grounds
[1:48:30] for God to step into that vessel and
[1:48:35] manifest himself
[1:48:38] amen
[1:48:42] Hallelujah
[1:48:44] we just had a brother visiting from
[1:48:46] India he lives up in the northeast
[1:48:48] corner of India close to uh Nepal I
[1:48:51] believe it is the mountainous region and
[1:48:54] and he's a a message Pastor brother
[1:48:57] Roshan
[1:48:58] and brother Roshan was telling me he
[1:49:00] said brother Tim
[1:49:01] you know in India the culture of the of
[1:49:04] the India the people of they have these
[1:49:06] castes
[1:49:08] which is like an order
[1:49:10] and if you're born into a cast I don't
[1:49:13] believe you can even graduate to the
[1:49:16] next you can't marry I mean this it's a
[1:49:18] very strict uh segregation if you will
[1:49:21] but he said brother Tim in the highest
[1:49:23] cast
[1:49:25] all of this is idolatry all this is
[1:49:27] Hedonism but you see Satan is a
[1:49:31] perverted
[1:49:32] of the real
[1:49:34] and there Satan don't have one original
[1:49:36] idea all his ideas are a twist
[1:49:41] but in the highest cast
[1:49:44] of these Indian families they believe
[1:49:47] that they
[1:49:48] are the are the products
[1:49:52] of the spoken words
[1:49:56] of their God
[1:49:57] they are an order of priests
[1:50:04] every one of them
[1:50:06] as soon as they are born
[1:50:09] is a priest
[1:50:12] because of a family that they were born
[1:50:14] into
[1:50:16] it so what is a priest he's a link
[1:50:18] between a higher power
[1:50:21] and something else ain't in trying to be
[1:50:23] rejoined yes so they believe as the
[1:50:27] highest caste that they are the result
[1:50:30] of the spoken word
[1:50:33] of their God
[1:50:35] and a priesthood
[1:50:37] but they are wrong
[1:50:42] the prophetic class amen is not a family
[1:50:45] it's not a world order it's not a nation
[1:50:49] it's not a race it's not a color it's
[1:50:53] not a culture amen it is the holy spirit
[1:50:55] amen the kingdom of God cometh without
[1:50:59] observation
[1:51:00] [Music]
[1:51:01] [Applause]
[1:51:05] as it was
[1:51:07] so shall it be
[1:51:08] as it was in Eden so shall it be as it
[1:51:13] was in the first amend of the flood in
[1:51:16] the first cataclysmic so shall it be
[1:51:20] as it was
[1:51:22] so shall it be when those conditions
[1:51:26] repeat in the end time
[1:51:28] God manifests himself again
[1:51:32] oh my
[1:51:34] Hallelujah I just got lost
[1:51:37] amen
[1:51:39] they believe oh yes they are a prophetic
[1:51:42] class of people they are the product
[1:51:46] of the spoken word
[1:51:48] they had it close in India but we got it
[1:51:55] amen
[1:51:56] and you're not just hearing a prophecy
[1:52:00] you're not just believing prophecy
[1:52:01] you're not just acknowledging that's the
[1:52:03] truth but you become
[1:52:07] you see God told Ezekiel prophesy
[1:52:10] son of man you see all these dismembered
[1:52:13] bones you prophesy and you will call
[1:52:16] them back
[1:52:18] to the original order and they'll stand
[1:52:20] up and March a mighty Army
[1:52:22] just like they did before
[1:52:25] when God stepped in
[1:52:28] I want to tell you something

[1:52:32] his presence is here his power is here
[1:52:36] his word is here his people are here and

[1:52:43] all the way into the Fulfillment of the
[1:52:47] promise
[1:52:48] amen always say brother Bradham is not
[1:52:51] here well he's coming back
[1:52:53] but first we got to get in our position
[1:52:57] Jehovah is here
[1:52:59] God is here
[1:53:01] amen and we're his people oh that's it
[1:53:04] that's it
[1:53:05] even thus shall it be in the day when
[1:53:09] the son of man is revealed in that day
[1:53:13] he which shall be upon the Housetop and
[1:53:15] his stuff in the house let him not come
[1:53:17] down and take it away and he that is in
[1:53:19] the field let him likewise not return
[1:53:21] back remember Lot's wife
[1:53:24] the son of man was being revealed up on
[1:53:26] the hill and she was too busy watching
[1:53:29] Sodom
[1:53:30] careful friends we don't take our cues
[1:53:33] from the modern Church
[1:53:36] we don't borrow from their worship we
[1:53:38] don't borrow from anything preach in my
[1:53:40] project keep your eyes amen you
[1:53:43] shouldn't even be looking in that
[1:53:44] direction look at the revealing amen
[1:53:48] remember
[1:53:49] whosoever shall seek to save his life
[1:53:51] shall lose it and whosoever shall lose
[1:53:54] his life shall preserve it I tell you
[1:53:58] that in that night there shall be two
[1:53:59] men in one bed for one shall be taken
[1:54:01] and the other shall be left it's so
[1:54:03] close
[1:54:04] two women shall be grinding together the
[1:54:06] one shall be taken and the other two men
[1:54:08] shall be in the field the one shall be
[1:54:10] taken in the other left and the answer
[1:54:11] that said unto him where Lord
[1:54:15] where Lord
[1:54:16] where will this take place
[1:54:21] and he said at the fifth
[1:54:23] wheresoever the body is
[1:54:30] you're not feeding on a man his words
[1:54:33] will fail
[1:54:34] but you're feeding on the unfailing body
[1:54:37] word of the son of man
[1:54:40] where the body is
[1:54:43] where the word is amazing amen where the
[1:54:48] message is preeminent amen where the
[1:54:51] revealed word of the hours

[1:55:08] potentials so when they hear there's
[1:55:10] Eagle food being served fresh by a
[1:55:13] pastor in a local assembly I'm going

[2:04:54] where were you going
[2:04:56] to church did you have to think about
[2:04:58] which road you have to take
[2:05:00] did you have to take another road to
[2:05:02] come to church
[2:05:03] so knowing where you're going
[2:05:06] to eliminate what you don't need
[2:05:14] we handed this on Sunday okay
[2:05:17] okay we handle this on Sunday when you
[2:05:20] know where you're going you know where
[2:05:22] not to go
[2:05:34] you said they didn't get it also I'll
[2:05:37] let you meditate on that one amen when
[2:05:40] you go when you know where you're going
[2:05:42] when you have the address the address
[2:05:44] that you get it eliminates everything
[2:05:47] else
[2:05:48] amen you will only associate your trip
[2:05:51] to what's going to help you meet the the
[2:05:54] address
[2:05:56] amen if you stop at the gas station
[2:05:59] because you need gas to meet your
[2:06:01] destination
[2:06:03] but you won't support the pharmacy
[2:06:05] because you don't need the medication
[2:06:06] going there so the pharmacy is
[2:06:09] eliminated by the direction that you
[2:06:11] have received
[2:06:17] we handle it on Sunday
[2:06:19] let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are
[2:06:22] approaching you humbly
[2:06:24] father tonight
[2:06:26] thanking you for this great message
[2:06:30] that you have spoken to us tonight
[2:06:33] the revealing of the son of man father
[2:06:36] you offer emphasize it again
[2:06:40] because that's the way the devil is
[2:06:42] trying to Triple somebody
[2:06:45] just to make this message to be just a
[2:06:47] religion
[2:06:49] or to be just another gathering but what
[2:06:52] we have is more than just stopping it
[2:06:56] I perceive that you are a prophet
[2:07:00] father he took the last stage of the
[2:07:04] woman of the well
[2:07:05] to unlock the potential that was hidden
[2:07:09] in the predestinated seat
[2:07:11] and your Prophet said over and over that
[2:07:14] the light flashes across it and the seed
[2:07:17] called it and father that's what
[2:07:20] separate the bride
[2:07:22] from any other Lord that's the reason
[2:07:25] why you could pray for Peter and not for
[2:07:27] Judah father thank you for speaking to
[2:07:30] us tonight
[2:07:32] and thank you for the working of your
[2:07:34] spirit in this place father
[2:07:37] may you bless your servant again for
[2:07:39] obeying
[2:07:41] and being yield to the spirit of the
[2:07:43] Lord
[2:07:44] he spoke many things that he didn't even
[2:07:47] know
[2:07:50] that you already minister to it
[2:07:52] and here you came again tonight to
[2:07:55] emphasize over
[2:07:57] and to demonstrate Lord father that you
[2:08:00] are backing not a man but you are
[2:08:03] backing your word
[2:08:05] and you mean what you are saying from
[2:08:08] this pulpit
[2:08:09] because you want your bride to be
[2:08:11] completely free
[2:08:12] father may you protect us as we're going
[2:08:15] to our respective Place may you
[2:08:17] strengthen him Lord father and remember
[2:08:20] his ministry and every project that you
[2:08:23] have for him may you continue to use him
[2:08:25] in a powerful way may you protect us
[2:08:28] father and if Tom Terry
[2:08:31] may we come back again and worship you
[2:08:33] in a spirit and in the truth we thank
[2:08:36] you for everything bless your children
[2:08:38] and touch those that you have a need in
