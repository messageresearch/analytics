[12:45] sang it it just i woke up with it
[12:47] about probably about four and it was
[12:48] just my head so i thought
[12:50] let's sing this y'all i'm sure
[12:54] i'm sure some of you know it we'll just
[12:55] pick it up we're not going to sing the

[15:25] oh jesus blessed
[15:29] jesus

[15:33] morning hallelujah
[15:41] i think that song was written it's
[15:43] probably close to 200 years old
[15:45] and i think isn't that the one that the
[15:47] piano kept playing
[15:48] during one of his meetings somebody fell
[15:51] out or something on the piano and it
[15:52] kept playing
[15:53] the great physician so that's a
[15:56] that's a pretty anointed song actually
[15:58] isn't it amen
[16:00] um so i don't have any praise reports
[16:04] i've got a testimony from brother
[16:05] charles

[41:26] are gonna see it straight right here and
[41:28] those online
[41:29] we gotta go with the old fashioned way

[41:33] amen okay so you hear this morning
[41:37] you got a little privilege so you're
[41:39] gonna see it straight to the camera
[41:41] but when you go home just make sure you
[41:43] can the one on the camera you make sure
[41:46] you really get it
[41:47] because i really want it when you go
[41:49] home you can study go over the sermon
[41:51] and make sure if you need the code it's
[41:53] there the reference is there
[41:55] so you can take it and use it and be
[41:57] prepared and build up for that amen
[42:00] don't forget the meeting for brother
[42:02] sean martin
[42:03] if you want to go there see brother abel
[42:06] amen as far as the cod book those who
[42:10] need it you
[42:11] make sure you write your name back there
[42:13] yesterday we ran out of time
[42:16] and there were a lot of people that
[42:17] raised their hand they had additional
[42:19] questions
[42:20] but tom was our enemies so the box is
[42:23] back there again
[42:25] and if you have questions go ahead and
[42:27] write them down
[42:28] put them there with your name and then
[42:31] from there on
[42:33] we can schedule the second one i believe
[42:35] it's going to be a brother
[42:36] kelly's house amen then you're going to
[42:39] know where your deacon live
[42:41] you already know where your song leader
[42:42] is amen
[42:44] now you're going to know where one of
[42:45] your deacon is living amen
[42:48] blessed be the name of the lord you
[42:50] might be seated i'm going to go through
[42:51] two things
[42:54] yesterday we touch on the hair
[42:58] amen we touch on hair here on wednesday
[43:02] and i'm sorry i was a little lengthy on
[43:05] wednesday
[43:06] but the anointing really hit toward the
[43:08] end
[43:09] and i didn't have a choice you just bear
[43:12] with me
[43:13] the time is bad and we're trying the
[43:16] best that we can
[43:18] to deliver as much word and scripture
[43:21] to make sure you have what is necessary
[43:24] for you to fight the battle amen
[43:26] so sometime just remember we will still
[43:29] be mindful
[43:30] but just remember we're doing this for
[43:33] the name of the lord
[43:34] we only have two servants a week on
[43:36] wednesday and on
[43:38] sunday i know the kids have to go to
[43:40] school
[43:41] but with everything that is going on in
[43:44] the world
[43:44] in the message what we came out of it
[43:47] you need a strong
[43:49] solid foundation amen sometimes we
[43:52] cannot go
[43:53] rush through it i have to take my time
[43:56] slowly
[43:56] to make sure it's received properly
[43:59] because when it's clearly received by
[44:01] revelation
[44:02] then it's anchor and you can fight on
[44:04] your own i'm not going to be with you
[44:06] when you're
[44:07] looking at the internet when you are in
[44:09] school when you're at your work
[44:11] but you must be uh build up enough
[44:15] to defend what you believe and we want
[44:18] to have a strong foundation that's why i
[44:20] go
[44:20] through scripture through the code to
[44:22] make sure you are built
[44:24] upon a strong foundation which is the
[44:26] word of god
[44:27] so when somebody asks you a question
[44:30] you're now looking for brother stephen
[44:31] you dare
[44:32] you can take the bible and then defend
[44:35] yourself
[44:36] amen so yesterday we went through a
[44:39] question on the hair we talked about the
[44:41] coloring in the air
[44:42] uh in the hair so those that were there
[44:45] already caught it i'm not gonna go over
[44:47] it again because
[44:48] the question was already handled on
[44:50] wednesday we handled one of them and i
[44:52] spoke about the week
[44:54] of the sisters that whenever you have a
[44:56] wig just make sure your wig look
[44:58] natural not a wig that have the hair
[45:00] that have been trimmed
[45:01] which give the wrong appearance so i
[45:03] felt like i need to give you the quote
[45:06] where brother branham say so you don't
[45:08] say my pastor is saying
[45:10] i don't want that even though i'm your
[45:11] pastor i want you to say the bible says
[45:14] and brother branham says because brother
[45:16] branham is perfectly in line with the
[45:18] scripture
[45:19] amen brother branham say if you got a
[45:22] hairpiece
[45:25] but are wearing one of these buildings
[45:28] how many know the beatles you know them
[45:32] are they good or bad people very very
[45:35] bad
[45:36] amen evil we don't have the beetle today
[45:41] but their spirit is still here using
[45:44] other worldly musicians amen
[45:47] and brother branham say if i could look
[45:50] right
[45:50] in one i'll probably wear one myself
[45:54] not a bitter wig in other words the
[45:57] revelation or the
[45:59] remain the same if you want to wear a
[46:01] wig
[46:02] make sure you don't copy the wig of the
[46:05] worldly musician
[46:06] make sure you don't go after the fashion
[46:08] of the world
[46:09] we don't want that because that's where
[46:11] you get a wrong spirit or a wrong
[46:14] anointing brother caleb just a little
[46:16] biafra
[46:17] but a hairpiece brother brother i'm
[46:18] saying but that's all right
[46:20] if you ain't got no hair and you want
[46:23] one
[46:24] if you can do it that is perfectly all
[46:26] right
[46:27] yes sir if a woman her hair is not long
[46:30] enough
[46:31] and she wants a switch of hair in it put
[46:34] it on sister the only thing
[46:36] we don't want you to look like the world
[46:39] amen
[46:40] make sure it's respectable it is decent
[46:43] and it's not giving a wrong impression
[46:46] and it doesn't look like the hair of
[46:48] beyonce
[46:49] or whoever is up there amen
[46:53] if a man takes a bad call than things
[46:56] and want even to his appearance to his
[46:59] wife
[47:00] if he wanted to wear a hair piece do it
[47:03] yes indeed nothing wrong with that no
[47:06] sir
[47:07] no more than you would be your teeth
[47:10] or artificial arm or anything else
[47:13] so if nature has taken something from
[47:16] you
[47:17] and it's so handy you go ahead that is
[47:20] perfectly
[47:21] all right if you don't have teeth it's
[47:23] okay to have false teeth
[47:25] if you don't have now it's okay to have
[47:28] faults now
[47:29] but not you already have now and they
[47:31] look good
[47:32] and now you want to add something to
[47:34] your now that's a different story
[47:36] amen if nature taking something off of
[47:39] you or
[47:40] your hair is uh shedding
[47:43] in a certain way that is not correct
[47:45] which i would first go by prayer
[47:48] and make sure we cast that demon because
[47:50] the bible says that hair
[47:52] was given to a woman for her covering
[47:55] so you don't want the devil to attack
[47:56] your hair amen
[47:58] it happened here in this church we pray
[48:00] for her sister and her hair begin to
[48:02] grow
[48:02] amen i'm not going to call her name to
[48:05] embarrass her
[48:06] amen the second one there was a question
[48:09] about the serpent seed whether he was
[48:12] natural
[48:13] or spiritual we answered that and
[48:15] brother robert mentioned something and
[48:17] when i was going home
[48:18] he kept coming back to my mind to my
[48:20] mind to my mind i went to sleep
[48:22] wake up he kept coming back so i felt
[48:24] like i don't want to miss what the holy
[48:26] spirit
[48:27] was trying to share through brother
[48:29] robert
[48:30] amen the question was the seed of the
[48:33] serpent
[48:34] is his spiritual seed or natural we
[48:37] answered yesterday that it's both
[48:39] and the other question was if nacho how
[48:42] does he come over from the flood
[48:44] when noah and his sons were the sons of
[48:47] god
[48:48] how did he come over through noah's
[48:51] son's wife
[48:52] so we already explained it yesterday but
[48:54] i just want to punch something right
[48:56] there
[48:57] in genesis chapter 7 verse 13
[49:00] the bible says that in the cell in the
[49:03] self
[49:03] same day enter who
[49:06] one you count with me and who
[49:10] two and him
[49:14] three and four
[49:17] the sons of who so we already have four
[49:20] there everybody clear
[49:22] and noah's wife how many five
[49:25] and three wife of his son with them how
[49:28] many
[49:29] five plus three equal eight into the
[49:32] water
[49:33] first peter chapter three verse 20 which
[49:36] sometime were disobedient when once the
[49:39] long suffering of god
[49:41] waited in the days of who noah while the
[49:44] ark was a preparing wearing few
[49:48] that is how many so peter was perfectly
[49:52] in line with the old testament everybody
[49:54] clear
[49:55] there was eight people here ate there
[49:57] amen
[49:58] now the problem is eight people entered
[50:01] there
[50:02] and all of these eight right here we
[50:04] found that noah
[50:05] and all his children were the children
[50:07] of god so how did the serpent seed
[50:11] enter remember the question is is the
[50:13] serpent seed
[50:14] natural or is it spiritual when it comes
[50:18] to natural i will prove to you yesterday
[50:21] that it came through the line of canaan
[50:23] everybody clear
[50:24] the bible says thou these are the
[50:27] generation
[50:28] of the sons of who shem
[50:32] ham and japheth and unto them were
[50:35] sons born when not before the flood
[50:39] ever clear they were born after the
[50:42] flood
[50:43] in other words everybody except eight
[50:46] people were completely
[50:48] eradicated or dead so those were those
[50:51] that were born
[50:52] after the flood but we found out that
[50:55] one by the name of canaan
[50:57] amen was cursed and canaan was not even
[51:00] the son
[51:01] of noah he was a grandson to noah
[51:05] so whoever told you that black people
[51:07] were cursed
[51:08] that's wrong get that out of your mind
[51:11] amen the son of who
[51:15] now these are the grandsons of noah the
[51:18] first one is kosh
[51:19] and mizraim and fat and cannon
[51:22] now we are trying to explain the natural
[51:25] seed through canaan
[51:26] which we did it yesterday and we proved
[51:29] to you that the canaanites
[51:31] were from the lineage of cain everybody
[51:33] clear
[51:34] now brother branham says that i want to
[51:36] give you coats now
[51:37] so the giant never come from pressing
[51:40] themself
[51:40] in these giant were the sons of who
[51:45] remember in genesis 6 yesterday whose
[51:48] father was the
[51:50] the serpent who looked in every respect
[51:54] exactly like a man but was a
[51:57] great and huge fellow bigger than l
[52:01] that is where your giant started
[52:04] everybody clear
[52:05] and that is where those sons came from
[52:09] because they were the sons of who
[52:12] because they were there
[52:14] now it's canaanite it's the grandson
[52:18] of noah everybody clear in the land of
[52:21] water
[52:23] where they come from and that is where
[52:25] cain went to
[52:27] you understand now so the land of noah
[52:30] that cane
[52:31] went was actually the promised land
[52:34] that's why when god was bringing
[52:36] israel back god told israel when you go
[52:39] to the promised land
[52:40] make sure you wipe everybody because the
[52:44] serpent seed naturally
[52:46] was there remember the spies when they
[52:48] went there they saw
[52:50] giant the sons of anak which were the
[52:53] anakims
[52:54] they were giant it was that serpent seed
[52:57] that have escaped
[52:58] that was right there in the promised
[53:00] land anybody clear now
[53:02] blessed be the name of the lord he said
[53:05] that also proved the serpentine it was a
[53:09] different race of people all
[53:12] together that was the serpent seed in
[53:16] paragraph 108.
[53:18] brother branham said that they were
[53:20] canaanite
[53:21] these water giant and they were the sons
[53:25] of who
[53:26] they just went through adultery of the
[53:29] wife of
[53:29] him committed adultery just like
[53:33] eve because brother branham said the
[53:35] seed went
[53:36] over the ark just like he did by eve
[53:39] which was an adultery we explained that
[53:42] yesterday
[53:42] amen and they were the sons of cain
[53:46] which were the son which was the son of
[53:48] who the serpent
[53:49] and the serpent was a giant man
[53:53] great monstrous sort of her fellow so
[53:56] you understand
[53:57] how the natural seed went by there
[53:59] everybody cleared so far
[54:01] in the message the ark and when we come
[54:04] over through the lineage of ken
[54:06] and he did the same thing they went off
[54:09] in the land of
[54:10] nod candid and they're married
[54:14] took his wife and went in there and
[54:16] leatherman and later
[54:18] man has become water it's coming from
[54:21] that lineage
[54:23] when the children of israel come up
[54:26] through there
[54:27] they found men even some of them had
[54:31] fingers of 14 inches long
[54:34] and i think of that great who
[54:38] david slohu in other words your prophet
[54:41] is telling you that the giant in the
[54:43] promised land
[54:44] were the natural seed of the serpent
[54:48] that escaped and were carrying over the
[54:51] ark
[54:52] by the wife of him who was pregnanted
[54:55] by a k knight by a descendant of kena
[54:59] she entered the ark with her pregnancy
[55:03] and that pregnancy was opened up after
[55:06] the flood because those suns were born
[55:09] after the water
[55:11] everybody cleared so far now when it
[55:13] comes to the spiritual side
[55:16] the spiritual side work with nimrod
[55:20] anybody clear the bible says and the
[55:23] sons of cush
[55:25] we right here siva and havela
[55:28] and sapta and rhema and saptica
[55:31] and the sons of rhema sheba and didon
[55:34] and the bible goes back again to cush
[55:37] and kush begat who nimrod
[55:40] he began to be a mighty one in the earth
[55:44] he was a mighty hunter before the lord
[55:47] wherefore it is said
[55:48] even as nimrod the mighty hunter
[55:52] before the lord and the beginning of his
[55:54] kingdom was water
[55:56] what i want you to understand here is
[55:59] noah had three sons noah was the correct
[56:03] lineage that came from god ever clear
[56:07] so noah had three sons
[56:10] the first one was uh shem
[56:14] and then we got ham and the third one
[56:18] was who
[56:20] japheth everybody cleared so far so
[56:23] from here him the scripture jumped down
[56:26] and the ham had cush anybody clear so
[56:30] far
[56:31] so the problem is this is still a pure
[56:34] line
[56:35] makes sense a pure line brought him
[56:39] and that pure blood brought kush
[56:42] and kush brought who nimrod
[56:46] anybody clear now brother stephen we
[56:49] understand that canaan
[56:52] was not the pure seed because kenan was
[56:56] a wrong child
[56:57] that's the reason why when ham committed
[57:00] sin
[57:01] noah did not curse him he cursed cayman
[57:05] which was a grandson ever clear and
[57:07] brother branham explained to us that
[57:09] that's where
[57:10] came the canaanite which were there
[57:12] giant that is the natural seed
[57:15] everybody clear so now if you are
[57:17] talking about the spiritual seed
[57:20] how can a spiritual seed of the serpent
[57:22] seed
[57:23] come through a pure line because noah
[57:27] was pure he brought him ham brought kush
[57:31] kush brought nimrod kenan came from the
[57:34] wrong seed line
[57:35] but how can the spiritual side come
[57:38] through
[57:38] a pure line
[57:42] anybody clear so far because when we
[57:44] look at the songs
[57:46] of know of him the other one we're still
[57:49] from the pure line
[57:50] how come that's why you need our
[57:55] blessed be the name of the lord genesis
[57:58] chapter 9 verse 1
[58:00] and god bless noah and his water
[58:04] so god did not only bless noah he
[58:07] blessed
[58:08] shem he blessed him and he also blessed
[58:11] who
[58:12] jeffered he was blessing the pure line
[58:15] yet the pure line brought a wrong child
[58:18] how can a pure line bring a wrong child
[58:22] cannon came from the wrong seat we all
[58:24] understand it's gonna be wrong
[58:26] what about the pure line the mystery of
[58:30] that
[58:30] is hidden in roman chapter nine
[58:34] romans chapter 9 verse 10 and 13.
[58:38] and not only this but when rebecca
[58:42] also had conceived by how many husband
[58:46] everybody cleared so far brother robert
[58:49] calls all of this
[58:51] amen rebecca conceived by how many men
[58:55] why does the bible have to clarify one
[59:00] why why we already know the husband of
[59:03] rebecca
[59:04] is isaac why does the scripture have to
[59:06] qualify
[59:07] one because of the serpent seed
[59:10] amen so he said rebecca
[59:13] conceived by one by isaac amen
[59:17] but when the children came one of them
[59:20] is jacob
[59:22] and one is iso how can a pure land
[59:25] produce a bad child
[59:28] everybody clear so far blessed be the
[59:31] name of the lord
[59:32] rebecca also had conceived by one
[59:36] even by our father who isaac
[59:39] for the children being not yet born
[59:43] neither having done any good or evil
[59:47] that's the purpose of god according to
[59:50] water
[59:51] when you are dealing with a spiritual
[59:54] aspect of the serpent seed
[59:57] do you need a key of the election
[1:00:00] of god it is no more the body
[1:00:04] it is no more the physical it is no more
[1:00:07] the natural
[1:00:09] the natural seed that goes through the
[1:00:12] sperm
[1:00:12] but now it's a spiritual seed
[1:00:16] amen blessed be the name of the lord
[1:00:20] through according to election must stand
[1:00:24] not of works but of him that calleth
[1:00:28] he was said unto her the elder shall
[1:00:31] serve the younger
[1:00:32] as it is written jacob had a love
[1:00:35] but he saw his water the child was not
[1:00:39] born yet why do you hate that child
[1:00:42] amen yet he's coming from the good
[1:00:45] parent
[1:00:46] the key is the spiritual gene
[1:00:50] the spiritual a seed of esau was wrong
[1:00:54] so there is a natural seed and a
[1:00:57] spiritual seed
[1:00:59] the natural came through canaan but the
[1:01:02] spiritual
[1:01:03] came through nimrod
[1:01:06] even nebraska came from noah
[1:01:10] but his seed spiritually was wrong
[1:01:14] just like esau makes sense now
[1:01:18] make sense
[1:01:23] hearing recognizing acting on the word
[1:01:26] of god
[1:01:27] when i say make sense i'm not talking
[1:01:29] about your brain
[1:01:30] i'm talking about your heart we see
[1:01:34] in these two songs that one day
[1:01:38] before they were even born they were at
[1:01:41] war
[1:01:41] with one another even though the virgin
[1:01:45] mother
[1:01:45] she was virgin she was a virgin the
[1:01:48] beautiful rebecca
[1:01:50] that married the righteous seeds of
[1:01:51] god's promise isaac
[1:01:53] that they were too consecrated
[1:01:56] spirit-filled believer on god foreign to
[1:02:00] the very marriage that they united
[1:02:02] together by
[1:02:03] because it took eliezer the angel of the
[1:02:06] lord working back and forth
[1:02:08] god foreknew it and how could such a
[1:02:12] thing come true that one mother by
[1:02:15] one father how everything is pure
[1:02:19] that's the spiritual aspect one
[1:02:23] a very evil person and another
[1:02:26] a very good person and how that the good
[1:02:30] person looked to be evil and the evil
[1:02:33] look to be good when you go down brother
[1:02:36] branham continuing paragraph 13
[1:02:39] he said we would know it today as the
[1:02:42] law of water
[1:02:43] it is not only election but the second
[1:02:47] key
[1:02:48] is called the law of contrast
[1:02:51] in other words when you have white you
[1:02:53] have black when you have dark you have
[1:02:55] light
[1:02:56] amen we will know it today as the law of
[1:02:59] contrast
[1:03:00] that where there is good there is water
[1:03:03] where there is right there is water and
[1:03:06] we will
[1:03:07] never no matter what our environment may
[1:03:10] be
[1:03:10] ever be able to shake ourselves from the
[1:03:13] presence of either one
[1:03:14] because it's the law of contrast so by
[1:03:18] natural
[1:03:19] canaan by spiritual it's nemirod
[1:03:22] it came through the pure line but this
[1:03:25] is no more natural it's a spiritual
[1:03:27] seed everybody clears so far brother
[1:03:30] branham in israel and the church part
[1:03:33] four
[1:03:33] for instance many of them like
[1:03:37] how that former religion began in what
[1:03:41] in kane how he come on out
[1:03:44] and come on down the sons of who
[1:03:48] and who now brother branham is not
[1:03:51] chasing the natural seed
[1:03:54] because cain was of the serpent
[1:03:57] now brother branham is saying that the
[1:04:00] spirit
[1:04:01] the religion of cain
[1:04:04] amen that spirit came through him
[1:04:08] not naturally but spiritually and from
[1:04:11] him
[1:04:12] he went through cush and from kush it
[1:04:15] went through nimrod
[1:04:17] because their spiritual gene is wrong
[1:04:20] even though naturally they are born
[1:04:23] differently that's why when jesus looked
[1:04:26] at the jew
[1:04:27] the pharisee he said you are of your
[1:04:30] father the who
[1:04:33] they say their father was abraham
[1:04:36] amen but jesus said your true father
[1:04:39] is the devil so naturally they came from
[1:04:42] abraham
[1:04:43] but spiritually they were the seed of
[1:04:46] the devil
[1:04:47] that's why brother branham said caiaphas
[1:04:49] was of
[1:04:50] the devil anybody clear
[1:04:54] how we come on down out and come down
[1:04:57] through the sons of noah who
[1:05:00] him out of him he had nimrod
[1:05:03] nimrod built the tower of water which is
[1:05:06] babylon
[1:05:07] babel comes on down through the king
[1:05:09] nebuchadnezzar time
[1:05:11] and now and on out into revelation who
[1:05:14] else
[1:05:15] babylon how that little seed
[1:05:18] started way back there at the east side
[1:05:21] of the gates of eden with kane
[1:05:24] come on down winding out all kind of
[1:05:27] coats and everything started back there
[1:05:30] winding themselves out to the end
[1:05:33] this natural side started through ken
[1:05:37] that's where the giant came in the land
[1:05:39] of canaan
[1:05:40] and then the spiritual side started
[1:05:43] through nimrod
[1:05:44] that was the answer we want to clarify
[1:05:47] everybody clear so far
[1:05:49] praise the name of the lord let's go to
[1:05:51] our scripture
[1:05:55] a message has already been preached
[1:06:04] let's go to the book of proverbs chapter

[1:08:34] amen that they may keep you
[1:08:38] from the strange woman from the stranger
[1:08:42] which flattereth with her words so this
[1:08:44] wisdom
[1:08:45] you needed to protect you against the
[1:08:48] bad woman
[1:08:49] which we saw was a prostitute verse six
[1:08:53] for at the window of my house you might
[1:08:55] be seated
[1:08:56] i looked through my casement and i
[1:08:59] beheld
[1:09:00] among the simple how many remember that
[1:09:02] word simple it means water
[1:09:05] naive the young men that are blind
[1:09:08] to women amen
[1:09:12] not blind that your eyes don't see but
[1:09:14] there is a different blindness of eden
[1:09:17] that when you eat the fruit your
[1:09:18] blindness is taken off
[1:09:21] amen and beheld among the naive ones
[1:09:25] are discerned among the old people
[1:09:29] youth we are still in that teenager
[1:09:32] puberty
[1:09:33] among the youth a young man void of
[1:09:36] water
[1:09:37] in other words a young man that is not
[1:09:40] in christ
[1:09:43] make sense now now it's different

[1:09:49] corner what are you doing
[1:09:50] close to the nightclub at night
[1:09:54] why are you in downtown at nighttime

[1:10:27] him out to drunk
[1:10:29] what are you doing around there
[1:10:33] passing through the street near her
[1:10:35] corner
[1:10:36] and he went away to her house
[1:10:40] he was the young man that is going that
[1:10:43] way
[1:10:44] the prostitute was on his on her own
[1:10:47] website
[1:10:48] it is the young man that is logging
[1:10:51] into her way and entering into the
[1:10:54] website
[1:10:55] of the prostitute she didn't call you
[1:10:58] you the one that used your phone and
[1:11:00] your computer
[1:11:01] going after her
[1:11:05] amen and it's done usually at night
[1:11:10] why a night passing through the street
[1:11:13] near her corner
[1:11:15] and he went away to her house in the
[1:11:17] water
[1:11:19] only at night a twilight in the evening
[1:11:23] in the black and dark night when you
[1:11:26] turn your light off you think mama

[1:11:32] and behold there made him a
[1:11:36] woman with the attire of a water
[1:11:41] the outside appearance of that woman
[1:11:44] is prostituted
[1:11:49] harlowed prostituted
[1:11:52] that's her outer appearance
[1:11:55] that's why the scriptures say flee the
[1:11:58] very appearance of what
[1:12:00] and the second thing she was a harlot in
[1:12:03] water
[1:12:06] a saddle heart we already explained the
[1:12:10] word saddle right
[1:12:12] the first time it was placed in the
[1:12:13] scripture it was by the
[1:12:15] serpent so you see who that woman is
[1:12:19] now a serpent seed in a female version
[1:12:24] let's go to proverbs chapter 9.
[1:12:29] amen you want to get to a serpent seed
[1:12:32] in a female version

[1:13:53] she has killed her beast the
[1:13:58] food or the meat
[1:14:02] of this woman is a fresh meat
[1:14:12] fresh meat it is not a meat that was
[1:14:16] killed before
[1:14:17] he gathered and a carry-on
[1:14:21] meat but the house of this woman
[1:14:25] when you get in her house her food is
[1:14:28] fresh
[1:14:29] it is a food that have been killed on

[1:15:02] not only does she have a fresh meat
[1:15:05] that meat is accompanied by
[1:15:08] one which is the stimulation of water
[1:15:12] it's a fresh meat fresh
[1:15:15] food that the woman killed with
[1:15:18] wine they both combined
[1:15:22] is it clear now the bible becoming you
[1:15:27] everybody clear she has also furnished
[1:15:31] her water

[1:15:37] course meal on her table
[1:15:41] how many meals does she have if she has
[1:15:43] seven pills

[1:15:52] so the woman has a house
[1:15:56] but she also has maiden

[1:16:31] you must be in that woman you must be
[1:16:34] in that crust in the female version

[1:22:24] blessed be the name of the lord part 29
[1:22:27] still dealing with the black dog on
[1:22:30] wednesday
[1:22:31] we saw that paul and peter described two
[1:22:35] women
[1:22:37] describe a normal woman which is a
[1:22:39] christian
[1:22:41] and they also describe a prostitute
[1:22:44] everybody clear
[1:22:45] then we went in the book of john in the
[1:22:48] book of revelation
[1:22:50] and in the book of revelation john also
[1:22:53] described
[1:22:54] another prostitute amen
[1:22:57] and she was called jezebel
[1:23:00] ever clear which is talking about the
[1:23:03] makeup right there
[1:23:06] everybody clear because she was the one
[1:23:08] that was doing that in the old testament
[1:23:10] jezebel she was also called babylon
[1:23:15] and she was a and a mother
[1:23:18] of what a mother of her lord meaning
[1:23:21] that her
[1:23:22] prostitution doesn't stop there
[1:23:25] just like wisdom have a house and have
[1:23:29] maidens amen that received the anointing
[1:23:33] from the
[1:23:34] manhouses the prostitute of revelation
[1:23:37] 17 also have made themselves
[1:23:41] but all those maidens are also hollowed
[1:23:45] and the prostitution here it is not only
[1:23:48] spiritual
[1:23:50] it is both spiritual and
[1:23:53] natural because the state of the church
[1:23:56] is known by the condition of the natural
[1:24:00] woman
[1:24:02] brother branham in a message proving his
[1:24:04] word
[1:24:06] if you want to know what condition the
[1:24:09] church is
[1:24:10] watch the way women act
[1:24:13] she is the word so if there is a natural
[1:24:18] prostitution here there must be a
[1:24:20] spiritual
[1:24:21] prostitution if there is a spiritual
[1:24:24] prostitution there must be a natural
[1:24:27] prostitution
[1:24:28] everybody clear amen she is the church
[1:24:33] see her immoral indecent
[1:24:36] watch look what the church is in just
[1:24:40] watch it see just watch women you see
[1:24:43] where
[1:24:44] how your women degrade and become so
[1:24:46] polluted
[1:24:48] that is the way your church is
[1:24:51] the tap if you go outside
[1:24:54] in this summer you're going to see
[1:24:56] almost
[1:24:57] naked women everywhere
[1:25:00] that son is the son of the churches as
[1:25:04] well
[1:25:04] in other words the women naturally
[1:25:07] are telling you that spiritually the
[1:25:10] church
[1:25:11] become a bunch of our lords everybody
[1:25:14] clear so far
[1:25:15] and in this whole lot of revelation 17
[1:25:19] when we pulled the harlot everybody
[1:25:22] cleared so far
[1:25:23] the bible says that she was set upon a
[1:25:26] beast
[1:25:28] let's bring it up in revelation 17 verse
[1:25:30] 3.
[1:25:32] the bible said that so he carried me
[1:25:34] away in the water
[1:25:36] we showed you on wednesday that that was
[1:25:38] a spiritual side
[1:25:40] into the wilderness and i saw a water
[1:25:44] a woman which is a church sit upon
[1:25:48] a scalloped colored beast a
[1:25:51] beast means a power in the scripture
[1:25:55] full of name of water she's an evil
[1:25:58] woman
[1:26:00] remember in the book of proverbs 7
[1:26:03] chapter verse 9 the woman have the
[1:26:06] attire of what
[1:26:08] and her lord she was also and she had
[1:26:11] what a sudden heart which was the heart
[1:26:14] of the beast
[1:26:18] in the garden of eden anybody clear
[1:26:21] and we found out that there is another
[1:26:23] woman here
[1:26:25] that have an anointing or a power and
[1:26:28] the power that she get is the power of
[1:26:30] satan
[1:26:32] everybody clear full of name of
[1:26:35] blasphemy
[1:26:36] having what seven heads and water
[1:26:40] she also have seven heads
[1:26:43] just like the wisdom also have seven
[1:26:46] people everybody clear
[1:26:51] she also have 7 and 10.
[1:26:55] just like revelation 10 7 but she flip
[1:26:59] it around
[1:27:00] ever here those are the mathematics of
[1:27:03] god
[1:27:04] revelation 13 verse 1
[1:27:08] and i stood upon the sand of the sea
[1:27:11] and i saw a water a beast rise out of
[1:27:14] the sea
[1:27:15] having water seven heads and what
[1:27:19] so the beast that the woman in
[1:27:22] revelation
[1:27:23] 17 was seated is exactly the beast
[1:27:27] that came out of the sea in revelation
[1:27:30] 13. everybody clear
[1:27:32] because the beasts of revelation 17 have
[1:27:35] seven heads and ten horns and the beast
[1:27:38] of revelation 13 has also
[1:27:40] seven heads and what ten horns and upon
[1:27:44] his horns were ten crowns
[1:27:46] and upon his heads the name of water
[1:27:49] the same thing that was over there verse
[1:27:51] two and the beast
[1:27:53] which i saw was like unto a leopard
[1:27:57] and his feet were unto the bear and his
[1:28:00] mouth was
[1:28:01] unto a lion like the mouth of a lion and
[1:28:04] the dragon who is the dragon
[1:28:07] satan gave him his water and his water
[1:28:11] and water so the authority of this
[1:28:15] beast the power of this beast
[1:28:18] and the seat of this beast is completely
[1:28:22] saturday amen if you go
[1:28:25] in the book of daniel you will see that
[1:28:27] daniel saw three beasts
[1:28:30] he saw the lion then he saw the bear
[1:28:33] then he saw the leper the fourth one
[1:28:36] daniel was not able to identify him but
[1:28:39] when you go to the book of revelation
[1:28:42] john is giving you the leopard the bear
[1:28:45] and the lion all of them mixed together
[1:28:48] into one beast just like the white horse
[1:28:51] rather
[1:28:52] the red horse rather and then the black
[1:28:55] horse rather
[1:28:56] when you take the three you mix it
[1:28:58] together you get the fourth one which is
[1:29:00] the pale color
[1:29:02] ever clear which is the work of satan
[1:29:06] now here is the water
[1:29:09] why do you need wisdom because you are
[1:29:12] dealing with another prostitute
[1:29:15] solomon say my son to protect you from a
[1:29:20] prostitute
[1:29:21] you need to have water and that wisdom
[1:29:24] must be a woman
[1:29:27] it must be in a church because in the
[1:29:30] end time there is an anointing of
[1:29:34] prostitution again
[1:29:36] upon the churches and upon the people
[1:29:39] and if you want to be protected from the
[1:29:42] end time prostitution
[1:29:44] you need to find the church that has
[1:29:46] wisdom
[1:29:48] everybody clear everybody clear so far
[1:29:51] to whom they have wisdom and water
[1:29:55] both of them together count the number
[1:29:57] of water
[1:29:58] which is 666 everybody clear
[1:30:02] so you need a church that has wisdom
[1:30:06] that's why christ came in the head of
[1:30:10] the prophet
[1:30:11] as the wisdom of god i am the wisdom of
[1:30:14] god
[1:30:15] this is not william marion branham this

[1:30:20] this is the supreme wisdom you need a
[1:30:23] church that has wisdom to protect you

[1:30:28] of babylon and that church is the end
[1:30:31] time

[1:31:36] to us and become wisdom to us
[1:31:40] in other words just like wisdom was made
[1:31:44] flesh in christ
[1:31:46] it is gonna be also made flesh in the

[1:33:47] to forsake
[1:33:48] wisdom then he begin to fail by strange
