of the lamb father you took this land and father you die for this land and lord you shed your blood lord father and you came down on sunset mountain claiming everything lord including this land and father this is the sabbath of this land lord whatever our sister has been battling in this body whether it's blood pressure or whatever sickness that was here father i pray in the name of jesus christ

opponent upon her lord and beloved fathered a pillar of fire that circled her completely and stepped between her and the work of darkness father we committed unto the hand in the name of jesus christ we bless her in jesus precious name amen god bless you mama amen amen god richly bless you so now let's stand for the reading of our scripture this morning like i said we don't have visitors we have family members family member from texas family member from georgia family member from north carolina wherever you come from god richly bless you good to see you mama amen let's go straight to our scripture this morning roof we stopped the last sunday on the rest of god when we started it then we stop somewhere amen so let's pick it up that's why i ask if you are together you up to date with the sermon because it's blending together i wish i have another father's day message but today is our father's day and let's see his message amen it says chapter 3 there but i want to draw something let's go to chapter 2 quick if you dare you can say amen hallelujah ruth chapter 2 verse 14. you already understand this but there is something that uh the lord opened up and i have to add it up so we make sure you got it i don't know who's still struggling in that area so hopefully you will get some clearance this morning amen if you're there you can say amen roof 2 chapter 14 and boasts say unto her unto roof at mealtime come you here we know the table of the showbread is open here everybody okay okay and eat of the bread and dip your morsel in the vinegar we already went through this amen and she sat beside the reapers you might be seated so ruth was invited to a table which was seen in the tabernacle was the top of the table of the showbreeder everybody okay because we found out that we had bread there and we also have a drink offering at this time it was vinegar which remind us of what happened at the cross yes you're still up amen but when roof sat at this table this turbo had boasts and boaz was not alone it was a table where boaz and the reapers were together which we know the reapers are the angels the scripture says that we already went through this which are the preachers amen and the top of them was the chief reaper everybody okay so the bible says that and she sat beside the reapers and he boaz reached her her perch corn and she did it and was so fast and left so she sat at the same table everybody okay that's the reapers are eating [Applause] everybody okay in this message we don't have two tables [Music] [Applause] we are not catholics where the priests have a certain food and the congregation are eating a different food you sit at the same table but here you sit with the same table but the one really giving the food he's not the reaper are we okay now roof sat beside the reapers but she's getting food from boas but you must sit beside the reaper and that reaper must sit beside boaz but the food that you are receiving you're not receiving that from a reaper you are receiving that from boaz directly into you so the one feeding you is not the reaper [Music] it is boys but you must be beside the reaper everybody okay so far amen now let's go to verse to chapter three hallelujah keep that in mind ruth chapter 3 verse 1. if you there you can say amen then naomi her mother-in-law say unto her my daughter shall i not seek what you know what it means now right last sunday we seen that rest in the bible means water amen shall i seek rest for you that he may be well with you if you remember this rest was not unveiled in the country of moab and this rest is not you going to your bed to sleep this arrest was connected to marriage you remember it was connected to a covenant he was connected to a wedding he was connected to a union there is a union that happened so when they say union marriage they're talking about the same thing invisible invisible is he complicated is the message complicated amen job to verse 14 hallelujah if you're there you can say amen i skip everything because there is a lot of deep stuff hand that are hidden right here so i'm trying to touch the first point then we will go back again and begin to follow that amen verse verse 14 and she laid at his feet not on the head i'm not gonna touch that today let's hold on amen and she laid at his feet the feet of boaz until the morning everybody okay and she rose up there was something that happened here before one could know another so when this is taking place some people are still [Music] sleeping are you reading between the line you are already trained to be reading between the line if you're reading your bible the same way we came out something is wrong everybody okay and he said let it not be known that uh a woman came into the water into the floor does anybody knows that roof is here does anybody knows what is happening here let me help you again is this a public show everybody okay so whatever is happening here it is not to the public no public is there it's only boaz and roof nobody's there no public no public show no public show here i wish you listen to the message everybody okay verse 15. also he said boaz bring the veil that you have upon you everybody okay she had the veil let's leave it alone and hold it and when she held it everybody okay you okay now and he laid it on so somebody begin to pour to unfold certain things anybody okay yes something is dropping and [Music] i'm trying to get it to you hallelujah hallelujah go to verse seven then you're gonna see what i'm talking about you there and when boaz has eaten and drunk and his heart was married he went to lie down at the end not at the beginning are we okay at the end of the what the heap of what so boaz was laying at the end where the hip the hip the heap of corn [Applause] where the heap of corn was that's where boaz was laying so if you're looking for boas you need to find a heap [Music] you okay now are you okay now when you find that hip you're gonna see him there and it's from that hip that he's poor six measure are we okay now did i lose anybody [Laughter] now let's go back to verse 15. and also he said also he said bring the veil that you have upon you and hold it and when she held it he measured how many six measure of water one two three four five six the first measure is barley the second measure is no different than the first one it's barley the third one is barley the fourth one is barley the fifth is barley the six is barley if you mix those barley together you can make a difference if you mix those valleys together you cannot separate them are we okay okay did i lose somebody if i lost you you raise your hand okay praise god the sixth measure of barley and ladies on her and she went into the who knew it nobody they have to tell you the story amen how can you doubt what happened there if you were not there yes you can say whatever happened there happened only the only thing i have i only have the sixth measure that i can prove to you either you believe the sixth measure or you just don't want to believe it that's your problem [Music] everybody okay verse 16. and when she came to her mother-in-law everybody okay she said who are you in other words how did he go my daughter and she told her all that the man had done to her everybody okay and she said these six measures of barley gave him me for he said to me go not empty to your mother-in-law when boaz was talking to roof boaz was telling ruth i'm giving you this i don't want you to go empty to your mother-in-law so when roof was picking up the sixth measure of of bali he was thinking about naomi in connection family connection with boaz so she was going home saying wow this man is very generous he's taking care of his family he's worrying about his mother-in-law praise god amen everybody it looks like it is coming the gift is going toward israel [Music] are you are you understanding me there is a reason why revelation 10. must be before revelation 11. [Music] brother branham said christ is the messenger to israel you okay but before he dropped to israel revelation 10 is pulling him out here the sixth measure of barley were given to roof okay and they were given to roof like they belong to naomi everybody okay one day belongs to naomi it is called trumpet we okay now when they belong to roof it is called seal [Music] so when roof takes it it's a seal when it goes to naomi it's a trumpet [Music] everybody okay is the bible complicated amen bear with me and she said the sixth measure of ballet gave him me innocently mama look this is what he gave me when naomi look let's see what naomi says about the sixth measure because they were a connection between them amen for he said unto me god not empty to your mother you know in other words this belongs to you then verse 18 says she naomi do whatever when naomi look at the sixth measure now let me turn around you say daughter that's it sit still don't worry anymore everybody okay so the six seals the sixth measure of barley had a message of shalom amen peace sit still don't trouble yourself anymore i hope you're getting it sit still my daughter until you know how the mother will water for the man will not water who got the pressure now who got the pressure so in other words your pressure has been transferred [Music] towards somebody else anybody okay he will not rest until he has until he has done what finish water this water which thing not finish these things one thing because one thing take up everything in it everybody okay until he has finished this the thing this water in other words do not worry anymore the measure of barley that you receive have a message and that message is stand still anybody care don't worry anymore it is no more in your hand it is in the hand of boaz but for sure guarantee he will make sure he finish it did you get the message let's go to first samuel chapter 21 hallelujah and you hear people the trumpet the trumpet the chop at the trumpet not complicated for the sake of time i'm going to skip some of them but you know the story david is running away david is running away he has been kicked out almost everybody okay amen let's go straight to verse uh three you know the uh background already now therefore what is under your hand david is asking the high priest give me if you want to know if it's a high priest there is a scripture for it and look you see me i'll give it to you now therefore what is under your hand give me what david asks for five loaves we know five is the number of water let's see if he's gonna get five you okay give me five loaves of bread in my hand and or what there is present in other words five grace or whatever is there everybody okay so there is a grace with something else it's hooked together everybody okay verse nine verse four and the priest answered david and say there is no common bread under my hand we don't have any bread that is mixed with leaven here because leaven top sin we don't have a gospel that is mixed with worldlyness we don't have it here everybody okay anybody okay but there is water hallow bread or the show bread if the young men have kept themselves at least from water you must stay away from other field you must stay away from denomination you must stay away from youtube listening to denominational [Music] to touch this bread you cannot eat this bread and then you going on youtube watching td jakes [Applause] everybody okay and david answered the priest and said to him of a truth women has been kept from us we are sanctified a bad is what three days since i came out and the vessels of the young men are holy and the bread is in a manner common yet though it was sanctified this day in the vessel we are pure if we eat we are pure just as the bread is pure amen so the gift so the priest verse six gave him hallow these are show bread hallow bread for there was no bread there but the water the show bread that was taken from before the lord so the bread that they gave david is a show bread how many show bread do we have in the tabernacle everybody okay we have 12 12 is the number of water david say grace or whatever the whatever turn up to b12 are we okay so it's a grace that is bringing you to a worship i'm reading the scripture give me five grace or whatever the whatever turn up to be twelve so that grace open twelve are we okay why is grace opening 12. everybody okay and it happened that this was the day they were changing the showbread amen when do they change the showbread on monday on tuesday on wednesday are you okay now you remember the mystery of the show bread that's why i keep saying keep up with the sermon everybody okay so far that was taken from before the lord to put hot in other words fresh bread in the day when he was taken away everybody okay when this giving of bread from grace unto worship is happening at the same place i want you to keep your spiritual jacket verse seven now a certain man of the servant of who was there that day everybody okay d-10 before who there was something with that man that the man was not able to leave the tabernacle the lord blocked the man anybody okay so that man have to be released the same time david is getting his bread let me read it and his name was doeeg a water do you know what ego means it means esau what is esau doing in a position in israel in the tabernacle how did esau get in the temple and god is blocking a seed of eso so we find out that at the same time this is happening there is a seed of esau that has been detained in the tabernacle when they are giving the show bread and the pudding new show bread everybody okay the chiefest of the herdsmen that belong to saul and david said to ahi malik is there not here under your hand spear or sword for i have neither brought my sword nor my weapon with me because the king's business require haste what happened to the old soul of david that he was working for saul why did he leave and forgot that sword anybody okay watch verse 9 and the priest say the sword of goliath the philistine whom you slew david you remember the first greatest exploit that you did to israel you did it with a sword and that sword after you did it was taken away and kept and never used again until this time that david is expelled going into the tabernacle and david now who never ate of the showbread now david enter in the tabernacle under the melchizedek lineage and is eating the showbread which is not lawful for him to eat and they told him there is a sword there you use it before a long time amen everybody okay amen he says whom you slew in the valley of elah behold it is it is here how is that sword wrap in a cloth behind the water do you know what the effort means the effort was what was holding the euro momentum everybody okay and brother branham said the euro member is a top of the bible everybody okay and the sword of goliath was put behind not in front of the ephod but on the backside [Music] amen are we okay on the backside of the effort that's where they put the sword and the sword was not open he was wrapped so they have to erupt the soul everybody okay [Applause] there is an effort which brother branham say it's the bible and behind this effort we got a sword and this sword was veil and he was given to david and david have to unveil the sword is he complicated oh my god oh help me amen verse 9 and the priest said the sword of goliath the philistine whom you slew in the valley of ilah behold it is here wrapped in the cloth behind the earphone if you would take that that's the only one i have there take it for there is no other save that here the only weapon in the tabernacle anybody okay and david say there is water so this sword cannot be compared to any sword it is a sword that is different than any sword amen there is none like that give it to me everybody okay so far let's go to revelation 5 then we pray hallelujah if i don't do this i don't want you to get lost because we're going to get into a deeper territory so you need to stay alert yeah if not you'll find yourself in the midnight zone and you don't know what's going on revelation 5 if you're there you can say amen i'm going to skip some of them because you know what is going on amen verse 1 and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written inside and on their backside are you okay now sealed with how many seals anybody okay what appeared to be seven seals in the old testament it's a sword anybody okay that's why in sabino canyon anybody here when brother brother was trying to ask god what is the meaning of the seven angel god drop a sword we okay now we clear now amen jump to verse uh forward and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look their own nobody can break the seals in verse two we say who is worthy to open the seals everybody okay and one of the elders said to me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david has prevailed to open everybody okay to open the book and to lose the seal thereof hey buddy okay and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elder stood the lamb as he had been slain having seven horn and seven eyes which are the seven spirit of god we went through this sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand everybody okay of him that sat on the throne when he took the book to break the seals everybody okay and when he had taken the book the four beasts and the 24 elder fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vowel full of orders which are the prayers of the saint we went through this and they did water so when the lamb pick up the book in revelation 5 the chapter of grace everybody okay when the lamb picked up the book and to break the seal he brought number 12. somebody begin to sing are we okay now we okay now and then verse nine and they sang a new song saying you are worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for you were slain and have redeemed us to god by your blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation watch verse 10 and has made us to our god what and water we become little melchizedek everybody here and we shall reign on the water this book when it's taken it is changing the redeem into kings everybody okay and into priests and the purpose for them to become king and priest is for them to do what when we're in heaven let me seal this then we move on go to revelation 20 go to revelation 20. job to verse 6 lord help me you there six blessed and holy is he that is part in the water who goes in the first resurrection who the bride okay on such the second death has no power you already know what it means but there shall be water priest of god and of who and they shall do whatever how long so the opening of this book [Applause] we okay it's transforming the believer to priest and king which is nothing but the lineage of melchizedek because mechizzadek was prison king everybody okay and the purpose is for you to reign on earth but that raining is how long a thousand mere means water everybody okay so far let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly this morning lord thanking you for your grace for your love for your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father we have done what any man that you give an ability to do can do on the face of the earth but when it comes to opening your word and bringing the scripture a life to your children you only take the supernatural action of the holy spirit father may you move me completely out of the way lord may you come and speak to your children may you remove every demonic pressure demon of pressure may you remove every demon unique spirit here that is making the people to sleep father we rebuke every demonic spirit that is contrary to your word may you come down and may shalom reign in this building and may you visit and speak to us this morning in the name of jesus christ amen amen god richly bless you in revelation 8 the bible says that when he opened the seventh seal remember last sunday there was a silence in heaven of about a space of half an hour we already know what the half an hour was but the key here is when the seventh seal was opened it was completely mute it was silenced we don't know what's going on my subject this morning is the four phases of roof god's rest the rest of god the rest of our father the rest of god last sunday it was the sabbath today it's the rest of god so put your seatbelt as we begin to go this is part 22. when we started with the tabernacle we took roof and roof enter into the gate roof have to go through many steps for the plan of redemption she went to the brazen altar she had to repent of her sin then from there she get to be baptized then from there she go into the holy place roof serving now we are in the fourth stage where roof now is resting where naomi open up the subject about the rest of the roof everybody cleared so far this is a big picture a macroscopic view of the plan of redemption when we went through ezekiel ezekiel entered into some more detail in a microscopic view where we found out that when we enter into the tabernacle whether you're born in a message or not you must find or meet the present altar to make a decision which we talked yesterday because decisions are very important because that's represent the the cross for us why the cross brother branham say that this whole bible to my opinion the whole setup is a dramatic story it's a big drama just starting out of eden when man was kicked out coming out through the gate on out and the way of the cross leading right back again so in eden we left the garden we left the blessing of god we miss the tree of life but through the cross we are not going away from the tree of life now we are going back again into the tree of life over there the kerry beam kick us out but over here the caribbeans are there to welcome you and me back again in the presence of god because the lamb gave his own blood and when he gave his own blood on cavalry the veil of the temple rented into and the way it was open telling the believer that now we can go back again into the presence of god brother branham said the way of the cross is leading right back again just all one big god picture god has placed out of his mind everybody cleared so far so when you finish there at the cross you make a decision that decision of giving your life to jesus christ will change your heart into a dark heart into a white one which ezekiel explained to us that he was a new heart then you go through the water baptism and you get baptized and when you get baptized then he sends you completely into the candlestick i'm going to emphasize that the candlestick will direct you to the table of the showbread now there is no difference between the table of the showbread and the candlestick the candlesticks are always connected to the table of the showbread amen everybody you cannot have a field without the reapers [Music] you cannot deal with the seed without the reapers everybody okay so far because if you enter into the tabernacle when you pass the other coat and when you enter into the holy place if the candlestick are not there this place is dark everybody okay so far if you enter into the candlestick the table of the showbread will be dark and the bread that is on the table of the showbread will not be visible to you everybody okay so far it takes the light of the candlestick ever here the candlestick will project its right and when the light of the candlestick struck the bread the bread that was dark become illuminated [Music] let's go to ephesian four i'm just climbing let's go to ephesians four hallelujah if you dare you can say amen go to ephesians 4 verse 13 blessed be the name of the lord you there few people amen you there but all things dada reproof ephesians 5 verse 13 ephesians 5 verse 13. if you dare you can say amen all things that are reproved or exposed are made manifest by what everybody okay for whatsoever does make manifest is what so the light is what will make this bread to become visible unto you everybody care because the bread represented the word of god but no matter how much you have the word of god if there is no light that struck the word of god this word will be dead to you because paul said that the scripture the letter killeth it is the spirit that giveth life so you must have a light that will shine on the and when the lights shine on the scripture then the scripture become illuminated and the scripture becomes the light of the hour [Music] everybody in other words you cannot separate the illuminated scripture with the light that have shined upon the scripture that's why brother branham said the messenger and his message are one and the same amount in the book of acts chapter 13 verse 27 the bible said that for they that dwell at jerusalem and their rulers because they knew because they knew him not [Music] that he was jesus christ no yet the voices of the water so to know god you must know the voice of the prophet [Music] everybody okay know the voices of the prophet which are what so those voices were read in other words what the prophet spoke turn into a scripture and that scripture must be read every sabbath [Music] that's why we must read the message of the hour every day that we preach here [Applause] because you must know the voice of the prophet in order to know jesus christ in our act chapter 15 the bible says this verse 21 from moses of the old time has in every city damn that the water let me read it again moses of the old time head in every city does that preach jesus [Music] they were preaching moses they were not preaching moses the man but they were preaching the law of moses they were preaching the message of moses and the message of moses was not moses the message of moses was christ brother branham say brother branham say we're not preaching the men brother branham we're preaching the message of brother branham [Applause] [Music] everybody here second peter say for the prophecy came not in the old time by the wheel of water but holy men of god spake as they were moved by water so he was not the prophet when they were reading the voice of the prophet they were not reading the man prophet they were reading the word of god that's the holy spirit spoke through the prophet everybody okay jesus said forever why didn't he say have ye believed jehovah [Music] because on the old testament his name was jehovah he didn't say have you believed jehovah he said have ye believed moses not moses the man moses as a messenger of god if you have believed moses you would have believed what for moses did what so there is no way you can receive christ [Music] without a prophet [Applause] but if he believes not his writing i shall he believe my water how are you going to believe jesus christ if nobody preach him to you go to the book of hearts i taught somebody this yesterday go to the book of acts i don't want you to say brother steven say the bible says or brother branham says everybody okay everybody okay you there up to chapter 8 verse 30. if you dare you can say amen you there [Laughter] okay okay somebody's there let's start to 26 so he help you up and the angel of the lord spoke to philip why does the engine have to speak to philippi why did philip do anything he already have the holy ghost he spoke to philip saying arise and go toward the south to the way that goes down from jerusalem to gaza which is desert and he philip arose and went and behold a man of ethiopia a eunuch of great authority under candace queen of the utopian who had charge over all her treasure had come to jerusalem to do water why didn't the angel of the lord go straight to the utopian and talk to him [Music] let's go to verse 28 he was returning and sitting in his chariot read who isaiah the preacher isaiah the water so this man was already a believer this man was going to jerusalem to worship this man was already a proselyte to the jewish nation and he was reading his bible just like you and me and he was reading a prophet everybody okay verse 29 then the spirit say to philip go near and join yourself today to this chariot and philip run there to him and heard him read who the prophet isaiah and say do you see that scripture understand you what you want so you can read the scripture but you don't understand it you can read this message and you don't understand it he was reading the prophet but he doesn't know what the prophet is talking about everybody okay verse 31 and he said how can i in other words i can understand except some man should do what somebody need to instruct you you must sit by the ripper [Music] when you come at the table of the show bread you must sit beside the reaper and that reaper must be connected to the spirit everybody okay so far he says verse 20 31 and he said how can i except some man should guard me and he desired philip that he would come up and sit with him everybody okay the place of the scripture which he read was this he was led as a ship to the slaughter and like a lamb down before the sheriff so he opened up his mouth in his humiliation his judgment was taken away and was declared who shall declare his generation for his life is taken from the earth this is what the eunuch was reading but he's reading no understanding in other words no revelation everybody okay verse 34 and the eunuch answered philip and say i pray you of whom speak of himself or of some other water when you are reading the message without the holy ghost this is where you get confusion whether brother branham is talking about himself our brother branham is talking about christ [Music] everybody here he took another reaper to be there and to take the prophet and to break it down until the eunuch realized that isaiah was not talking about himself but he was jesus christ in isaiah so when we are preaching isaiah we're now preaching isaiah we preaching jesus christ in the life of isaiah and let me put it wrong when we preach brother branham we're now preaching brother branham we're preaching jesus christ in the life of brother branham you want to call me branamat go ahead and call me you just don't understand what it is the messenger in his message i won [Applause] that's why brother branham said you are not feeding upon the word of men but you are feeding upon the unfailing body word of the son of man that's why the message is christ this message is jesus christ [Applause] don't worry buddy you will do you good everybody okay so far so you need to go through that and it's gonna lead you to the uh after offences from there then you got a new spirit everybody okay now from the new spirit we need to go into the inside where we get his spirit but we found out that the key to go on the inside was water obedience but here that's why roof have to stay on the field don't listen to any other field and she have to keep fast with the maiden and finish the entire harvest and when she did that naomi said now are you worthy to go into the holiest let me now open up the subject about the rest we found out that this place is very important because we talked about the road of aaron it was dead it could turn into a stake until they put that road into a holiest when they put it there they hold battered he blossomed and he brought fruit this fruit never came with the connection of the road to the ground did you hear me they never took that road and planted it is not a worldly fruit you don't need worldly root all you need is detect the road and just leave it there the longer it stays in the presence of the sun ever here without any root without any work just sitting and resting under the presence of the chicana little by little you want to find yourself batting and after a while you blossom and before you know it you begin to begin to produce fruit and those fruit will tell exactly who you are because nobody knew this was an almond tree the identity was lost but here until it went into the only of all yes then your true identity will come out what you really are so we came in this world we were lost in sin we were lost in our families we thought we belonged to our family but we found out i'm not the child of ella branham i am not the child of mr branham i have another father a father that came from heaven his name is jesus christ and you want to produce fruit that are reflecting jesus christ [Applause] let's give him a clap offering [Applause] hallelujah everybody okay so far did i lose anybody if i lost you you raise your hand blessed be the name of the lord so the subject open up with roof in chapter 3. everybody okay roof open naomi open the subject that my daughter i have watched you i seen everything you were doing there was another rest that never came to my mind when i was in the country of moab but here you remember i told you there is no hope for you there is no husband but suddenly there is a thought that was on the back part of my mind [Music] you see the man you were working with yes i know him do you see his picture on the wall yes that's him what do you see when you look at him [Music] roof look he say no it's just a man what do you see my daughter he said oh he's good looking he said no look clearly what do you see in that man he said that is not your boss you've been calling him a boss for a long time because he was giving you paycheck because you were serving because you were following the people behind and you were gleaming over there look at your eyes pretty good that is not a boss that man is a potential husband [Applause] you want to get married he said look at my age look at his age do you think i can marry him do you think i can marry him what are you doing here anybody here he said oh mama so you mean me say yes you but he's a big boss okay everybody in the company are scared he said that man is the nearest kingsman but here your entrance into the family reconnected you to the original bloodline of judah [Music] everybody okay so far so my daughter i need to find you rest and we found out that what is rest rest was the sabbath ever here and last sunday we found out that there is three sabbaths in the scripture the first sabbath was the sabbath of the rest of god the second one was the rest of israel and the third one was the rest of the church and we started with the rest of god and we stopped somewhere that's why we are picking up god's rest what is god rest everybody okay so far we found out that according to the scripture you can take your seatbelt off according to the scripture in genesis 2 verse 2 the bible says on the seventh day the sabbath which is the rest happened on the seventh day anybody okay on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made amen how can you end the work in a day yesterday we were working we pull up the tent right after we pull up the tent did we have any more work to do so normally the work ended on yesterday so how can you come today and you say that i am ending the work yesterday did you do any work today so why are you ending at work in the day that you didn't do work hallelujah so god ended his work which he had made so this ending means that there is something that happened on the seventh day that we don't know and whatever happened in the seventh day finish seal stop ended the entire work of god what happened in that day we don't know that day is just telling us that god ended it's a silence day it's a mute day it's a day that doesn't give much information it doesn't give us no detail how what happened okay now when when we say god ended what does he mean does it mean that god went and sat down does he mean that god went to sleep does it mean that god went fishing what does he mean ending hallelujah god ended his work which he made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he made brother branham said this rest was a physical waste but god was not human yet god became human in jesus christ how can a spirit rest physically everybody okay so far hallelujah he said god blessed the seventh day so it's a blessed day [Music] hallelujah and god sanctify it you remember that sunday because that emit in that day god had rested from all his work which god created and made what caused god to rest if you have a task to do anybody care in order to rest you must complete your task then you will be able to go to rest so that is telling us that on the seventh day god already completed his work now god never rested after the first day everybody okay god never rested after the second day god never rested after the third day never rested after the fourth day but god rested after the sixth day so the sixth day has something in me everybody okay that triggered god to god to rest [Music] everybody okay are you following me so there is something that happened on the sixth day when it happened god stop and say this is it i need to go to rest what happened on the sixth day let's go to genesis chapter one the rest of god god's rest what is god rest genesis chapter 1 if you dare you can say amen amen amen few people i want everybody to be there some of you sit quiet like you suck at maybe when you go home you're going to forget everything so don't act smart this is why you get the c on the test i'm gracious to give you see so you can still pass everybody here let's go to genesis chapter 1. everybody there go to verse 10. anybody care everybody okay and god called the dry land earth and the gathering together of the water called the he water and god saw that he was what god created was what everybody okay with me job to verse 12 and the earth was brought forth grass the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after its kind and the tree yielded fruit whose seed was in itself after it can and god saw that he was everybody okay job to verse 18 and to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from the darkness and god saw that he was how many good do we have good good good everybody okay job to verse 21 and god created great dwells and every living creatures that moves which the water brought forth abundantly after they can and every wing found after each can and god saw that he was is it different than any other goods job to verse 31 everybody okay [Music] and god so after creating something on the sixth day because this is the last chapter of the first uh the last verse of the first chapter before god rested and god saw everything that he has made and behold he was not just good everybody okay he was very good so throughout the first day when god looked good look good look good when god created something on the sixth day god looked and he was not good he was very good and after that god stopped and rested what was created on the sixth day and how was he created let's go to chapter verse 26 you there now god say let me is god double stay alert stay alert because i'm coming anybody here before god got to this point let me go let us make man in our own water before you move forward you need to know what is the image of that god [Music] [Applause] in other words the man that was created was created in the image of god in other words the men look like god [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] anybody here but we know according to john 4 chapter 21 verse 21 the bible said god is earth [Applause] god was a spirit we already went through this i'm touching up quickly anybody okay this spirit in himself he has a bosom you remember and in the bosom there was a son anybody here he was called the logos because the bible said the only begotten of the father who was in the everybody okay anybody okay so god the spirit moved somebody out and the one who came out you already know this came as a pillar of fire as a light everybody care and this process here we know it's called god being immorphy anybody okay but this one when the sun came this because he gave birth to something he took the name of the father everybody okay then the one who he was giving birth became the son everybody okay and this spirit could not remain spirit because there is a process called keonosis you already know this where the spirit itself enter inside the sauna ever here and they too become one this is why when philip said show us the father and that will finish the problem and jesus said philip still now you don't understand when you see me you see the father because me and my father we are [Applause] everybody okay so far so this one that came out the theologian call him the theophany which is the logos which is the word body ever care about so far then this theophany was made flesh in demand called water so you have three components here number one you got a spirit number two you got a theophany and number three you got a human body everybody care but in the beginning the man jesus was not there because jesus was not born yet ever here because john said in the beginning was there everybody care and the word was with and the word was any question in the beginning was there and this word was with as an attribute and this word was because god dwelleth in the world everybody here so this part right here is eternity everybody here and this part here is the beginning everybody here so when god became the pillar of fire this is where god begin to create stuff [Music] but here that's why hebrews say nothing was created without him without the word it was the word that was created everything so the word created on the first day everybody okay the word created on the second day the word created on the third day the word created on the fourth day the word created on the fifth day but on the sixth day everybody okay so far the word the theophany the logos begin to create something that look like him [Music] everybody okay so far everybody okay so far let's go back now to genesis 20 126. that's why he says let what me and my me and my father let us let us the us means me and my father we are one that's why he said let us create if you believe on me me and my father we will come and dwell in you let us create it's me and my father but me and my father we are one let us create what in our own water and in our own water everybody okay everybody here everybody here now in verse 26 the bible say let us make man let me look at my time if you're worrying about time chill out i'm good in time we're just in eternity okay before somebody begin to do this let's go to verse 26 amen let us make man in our own water this is not a physical man because this man is not physical he became physical in the man jesus christ because jesus was the invis the visible image of the invisible god in him in jesus dwelleth the fullness of the godhead everybody okay so far now verse 26 he said let us make man in our you see our the two in the theophany in our image which is the word after our likeness and let who so man is not one person are we okay am i reading a different bible he didn't say let him he say let them so man is double the man that they're trying to create here on the sixth day is a double man he's a doer man he's a them who is inside this man everybody okay anybody okay everybody okay praise god let's see in our image in our likeness and let them the man singular have what stop when god created the star did he give the star dominion when god created the moon did they give the moon dominion when he created the animal did they have dominion when he created the fishes and the fowl did they have dominion the only person that god opened his mouth and say this one i'm gonna give him dominion i am giving him dominion in other words i am giving him authority [Music] everybody okay so far if god is a theophany he's a word he's a logos and he's created man like him anybody care this man is also what are we okay did i lose somebody this man is also here to he's also a word he's also uh so he is theophany plus authority [Music] everybody okay let's see what does dominion mean i may i have dominion over the fishes of the sea over the fire of the earth over the cattle over all the water and over every creeping things that creepeth upon what what has dominion mean everybody here in other words man is the top of everything men control everything everybody here because the roman centurion told jesus christ that i am a man in other words i have a head okay because i have a head i also have authority and my authority lays with my word when i tell my servant go you go come back here you come back here jesus look he said disunderstanding the jews don't know this this understanding of authority by the spoken word the jews don't know this this man is automatically breaking into the material of god here because he was a man under authority with authority let me help you up again a police officer have power when he is under power everybody okay when he work with the state he has power to arrest you everybody okay as long as his connection with the state remain correct his power is still valid everybody okay he loses power when he is disconnected from the state when they fire him you can do to the police officer whatever you want to do with him everybody here but if he is under if adam is still in connection with god [Applause] then his authority is still valid adam will lose authority when he kind off connection with god did i lose somebody so the authority is connected to connection did i lose somebody so authority is connected to connection to a higher power ever here this authority [Music] this dominion [Music] is a hidden language [Music] [Applause] [Music] the police officer he have to work with his contract to show you his contract before he arrests you everybody the contract is the tattered d and that tattoo gives him authority and the day he's gonna mess up with the state he loses his tattoo and the state recuperate their authority back that's why brother branham said adam had the tattoo because the totally gives you authority and dominion as long as you say connected with your maker did i lose somebody we are on the sixth day what happened in the sixth day so on the sixth day we found out that man is created and the man that is created on the sixth day is a theophany anybody okay a word buddy everybody okay hey logos everybody okay with the tata deed and the tattlet give him dominion and authority everybody okay everybody okay so if you come on the sixth day you follow me and you look at them and you look god you will get a little bit confused [Applause] everybody okay because whatever god is adam is whatever god may do adam may do also [Music] everybody okay let me help you up so it makes sense if you come on the sixth day and you say where is adam you will see a man that look like god a teaofani with a book anybody okay anybody okay let me help you up again on the sixth day we found that there is a man this man is both men and female let's go to verse 27. so god created man in his own water in the image of who so adam was god am i reading a different bible in the image of god created him watch verse 27 him semicolon male and what did you see the name of eve so when you call adam who comes not adam one two adam they are connected you cannot split them [Music] when you say adam eve say yes anybody okay mel and kim female created he what and god blessed them both of them so the woman is equal [Music] [Applause] no difference with the man she became different in genesis 2 but right here equal whatever adam does [Music] if you said adam was here it means it was there and if adam was created in the image of god and adam was male and female what do you expect god to be [Applause] you are afraid to say you are afraid to say it god also is man and female [Applause] everybody okay the female part of god is as much powerful as the male party [Music] [Applause] i know this is not mashed potato this is not applesauce buddy this is steak [Music] this is t-bone steak so you need to have teeth spiritual teeth to choose everybody here this is not milk buddy ever care so god was also male and female [Music] and god blessed them both of them and he said be water and do it and do what replenish the earth and subdue it and have water how can they multiply in the theophany [Music] [Applause] they were not in the body yet how can they fill the earth with the theophany the question is the answer is how did their father fill the earth [Applause] life and death are in the power of your tongue whatever you say [Music] i deride whatever you say whatever you say about your family whatever you say about your children whatever you say about your wife whatever you say about your husband that's gonna happen look at your husband say this is a blessed husband this is a wonderful person this is the the best husband [Applause] everybody okay so what happened in the sixth day another god appear [Music] [Applause] that can do the same thing that god does [Applause] everybody care and this god have the tattlet everybody here so when you see adam walking he has the tattoo all of this was hidden in the seventh day it's the seventh day that explain you what happened in the sixth day [Music] [Applause] [Music] that's why when adam slept before they created if they have to open adam because adam was double [Applause] but here that's why jesus said the cross they have to open jesus christ [Applause] because jesus also was doubled [Applause] that's why they pissed him on the side and what came out of him water and what jesus was giving birth because when a woman gives birth water and blood comes up water looted blood wasteland and the spirit pentecost [Applause] everybody cares of her on the sixth day what happened the theophany of men have the tattle deed and this theophany is both male and female and it's dominating everything [Music] anybody okay when god look at that god back up he said that's it let me take my gloves off i have finished the work because what i created is exactly like me that's why god never named the animal [Applause] [Music] but here he called adam and he put the animal there that's why the bible said let this mind that was in christ be also [Music] who him not robbery to be with who if jesus christ has a bride him and his brother [Music] everybody okay so what happened why is god resting because there is a man that is created in his own image and that man is a theophany with a tattoo d in his hand [Music] that man is a theophany with a tattered d is his hand that man is a theophany because this man that was created here his other uh you can just click his other name is called christ hey but here if he is christ then adam also is crushed this is messiah this is messiah yet everybody okay so far everybody okay so far so there is a christ that is created and the cross that is created on the seventh day has a tattered ebook when christ appeared on the sixth day with a tattered d book god rested what is the rest of god ever here brother branham says this that sabbath as a day is not a sin you okay a sabbath day was a seal of creation a seal of god's creation he finished it then he did what so this sabbath became a seal that's right with his server but he was a type of the christian anybody okay so god's sabbath was a shadow for you now after he had finished his creation he gave them the sabbath as a what as a seal that he has finished his what put your seat belt on then when he finished his plan of water he had another we okay god created in six days and on the seven he put a seal brother branham say the same way he did it he also have a plan of redemption that he made and then he seals it if the ceiling everybody care happen on the seventh day and the ceiling still sixth day the plan of redemption must also have six adams amen where are you going brother stephen in revelation 10. okay the mighty angel came down from heaven his name is who crust cloth with water and a rainbow was upon his water covenant his face was as he went there and his feet as what his feet has what his feet has water so who came what form of god came down what form came the logos oh christ or what let me help you up again when when paul was going on his road to damascus [Applause] [Music] paul met a light and the light struck him down and then paul talked to the light he turned again he said who are you lord in other words who are you elohim and elohim look at paul he says my name is jesus anybody here so the one who came on sunset mountain is jesus the theophany not jesus with nelskar [Music] are we okay are we okay he says and he had a water a little water i thought on the sixth day adam was a tiopani with a book okay now in revelation 10 we found a theophany with a book but remember in genesis when the theophany was with a book god rested ever here because adam received dominion after all the earth if god rested when man was a theophany with a book what happened if the theophany comes down again with a book what follows that what follows that [Applause] [Music] did i lose you when he came with a book open he set his right foot on port water and the left foot upon water what does it mean relax i'm gonna head to the airport lord help me relax he put his right foot upon the water and he's left put upon what i skip certain stuff go to revelation 13 what is the rest of god what is the rest of god go to revelation 13. and then we head to the airport i thought i'm going to finish this but it's it's it's so big let's go you there first one and i stood upon the sand of the water and i saw a beast rather out of the water so they see produce a beast anybody okay a beast having seven on and ten seven heads and ten horns and upon his own ten crowns and upon his quran the name of water and the beast witcher so was like to a leopard remember daniel and his feet were as defeat of a bear remember daniel and his mouth as the mouth of a lion the three animals put together remember daniel everybody okay and the dragon which is satan gave him his water and his water and a great water so this beast have a demonic power everybody okay anybody okay job to verse 11. and i behead another one coming out of the water so the earth also produces a beast [Music] everybody okay and the beast he had how many horns like a water and he spoke as a water and brother branham said that two horn was civil seavilles mean politics and a water hey mark here so the sea and the earth produce three power yes my brother i hope you are with me the sea produce demonic power the earth produces political and ecclesiastical those three powers are the pearl horse [Music] because brother branham said the pelhouse have three colors that are mixed together and those colors are political ecclesiastical and demonic power and the name of the pearls was water so when the mighty angel is coming down he's stepping on death in all his aspects [Applause] everybody here they were the pearl horse that is riding on laodicea there is a mighty angel that is coming down and he is the answer to that horse [Music] because because man in the theophany with the book have dominion so the angel in theophany with the book must have [Music] [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay lord have mercy what are you saying brother branham say the f chapter of revelation only revealed the scene of the water where nothing the seventh day nothing silence anybody okay is not revealing the seventh seal it's revealing of the seven seals is perfectly what so when you answer when they open the seventh seal quiet when god rested quiet but we found the answer to the quietness of god is man was created with a logos with a teopany and we found in revelation 10 another man another crust with theophany and with water the rest of god all the way back from what [Music] this what brother branham said all the way back in genesis the seventh seal he spoke of [Music] so we need to go back in genesis at the beginning of genesis you're gonna find the seventh seal there so the rest of god on the seventh day was actually the seventh here he said all the way from genesis the seventh here is spoken from the word so you must go at the very beginning of the book of genesis you will see the seventh seal there and brother branham left it quiet it is now up to the holy spirit to take us on genesis and we found out that on genesis there is a specific day that is quiet and it's the seventh day and god doesn't say anything about that day but the answer to that day is on the sixth day which is man with a book and the theophany and we go back in revelation 10 after the opening of the seventh seal we see now with maddie andrew coming down with a tiophony and with the book so the rest of god is the seventh seal open [Applause] you okay now let's go to our closing now what does it mean the seventh seal open ever here jesus christ in speaking todd of the water when he turned out there he when he got to the seventh he did what god did work in sixth day on the seventh day god what boaz gives six measures of ballet on the seventh one [Applause] can i repeat it again god open the first here open the second seal up and the third open the fourth open the fifth open the six at the seven first day second day third day sixth day he was very good seven roof come here open your stuff one two three four five six go home [Applause] that's why naomi said six he never gave you the seven don't worry anymore the seventh seal has been open restylubred he got control over everything don't worry anymore go to sleep the rest of god let me head to the airport when he told all the water he got to the seven he did what he said what [Applause] what are you talking about brother branham say this seven seal which is the rest of god which is the sabbath of god which is the sabbath of boaz this seventh seal what is it you ready now you ready now you ready now it is the end of time it is the end of what the things written in the seventh year book syllab of the plan of redemption from before the foundation of the word he ends what it is the water it is the end of the struggling water [Music] your passion that you are struggling with that snake that you passed through the present altar and the snake was there and you went to the water and the snake was there and you went to the holy place the snake was there when you enter into the holiest when that seal is broke over there you have to deal with the snake it is the end of the snake everybody okay it is the end of the struggling water your nature that you are struggling with [Music] the rest of god will finish that no more struggling everybody here it is the end of what it is the end of water do you know what a trumpet is a trumpet is a whooping that god give to the jews to bring them back to the promised land amen if you are in the holiest god doesn't need to whoop you anymore to bring you back to him he finished the trumpet of your life everybody he finished the water do you know what a valley is a valley is a curse when you reject the word you will never be cursed of god the rest of god finishes amen it is the end of the vow it is the end of the water that's why the road of aaron didn't need the earth again to produce fruit the earth was finished it is even the end of what what does it mean time is ending in your life what does it mean brother branham said when a man is born of the spirit of god he is a creature no longer of what but he is a creature of water he is passed from death and water he's passed through the element of through the time element into water he can never perish anymore [Music] nobody can kill you anymore everybody here if somebody tried to touch you he's bringing you back in the presence of god but here he said you know down in your heart that's a supernatural work has been done by a supernatural being when you were you was drunk and did water and did water and you women loved the world so much you keep wearing your makeup your short hair and doing other things you did and you found out something did water that's all the devil in hell could not make you do it there something did water a god of miracle water what did he do he changed you change you change your a supernatural word by a supernatural god make a creature of time to a creature of water the seven seal and your time and your trouble and your trumpet and your valve everything that's why god rested he unfolded six on the seventh he rested he unfolded the sixth year on the seventh he rested boaz opened the sixth measure of bali at the seven boaz didn't say anything he said go with the six when naomi saw the six say that say stop worrying stop struggling stop kicking up again now it's time for you to go to sleep amen rest a little brad for all these don't worry anymore it is not your problem it is his responsibility to put his foot on the sea to put his foot on the land to take care of your problem you rest because god took your place god's rest is the seventh hill that same rest ushering into the millennium but we gotta stop here because i cannot touch the millennium amen amen god's rest was hidden in the garden of eden the rest was the seventh year it was perfectly close but it means that men have the turtle did that you lost that adam lost the dominion that you lost i am bringing that down i am now i am controlling the two beasts but i'm not only controlling the two beasts i have a book that book is open now john go to the angel go get the book because when you get the book you get the tatter d you get the contract back the police department hire you back you have power back now it's time to exercise your authority because the contract is back the title d came back now you need to speak because you are no longer any man but you become a man and a woman i'm the authority so what you speak must happen if i say go here it must go if i say come here it must come because god rested on the seventh day in the seven church ages under the seventh messenger of the seventh seal that is your rest let's stand [Applause] [Music] this is just a portion of this rest now when we say the turtle d have came back you begin to understand what we are telling you why because our connection now with the father is wire back and because you made peace with god you are brought back again to what adam and eve were before the fall that's why god is bringing the book of redemption ever here because when adam lost that book he took the book back from adam and he sealed it with six with sevenself and he closed the book amen but in sunset mountain he's telling you the penalty of what adam did it's already been paid now i'm restoring the book not as a close book because when i took it it was open men could do anything let me break the seals again and let me give it to you now you have the contract no matter who you are how little you are where you are remember you got a contract you are under authority and when you are under authority you have power to exercise dominion sin can no longer rule in your life [Music] amen amen no matter what they say in politics don't worry about it because there is one foot of the angel that is blocking politics politics will do nothing to the bride even the squeeze matter of fact the squeeze will release the third pool [Music] brother bonham said when you see the squeeze he said watch the third pull then why because the part the third pulled the power of the spoken word why because the title d is back when the devil thinks he's gonna corner you that's what pushes you to speak and when you speak it's not really you speaking it is the true you that is inside of you that you speak sometimes you go to trial through many problems and you are cornered you say god knows everything and that same god knows everything tomorrow you see things begin to change you didn't pray but that word that came out god knows everything that word will chase your enemy that word will whip people and bring the people back to you to apologize to you of what they did because you just express something and what you express god picks it up and say if it's my child word it is as soon as sure as my word that's why they put brother branham in tests they put people doing wrong things they say say something they knew brother branham could struck dead and by the random say i forgive them he said that's exactly what i would do because if it was me i would forgive it that's my sound in my image he can exercise authority the correct way amen anybody here because it's the rest of god and you are god if your father rested that means to you also and when you rest your responsibility goes back to boaz it is not you to take care of your life anymore put your car in go to sleep a little brad let boaz take over heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly father thanking you for your grace thanking you for your love and find and thanking you father for the rest that you have sent in this stand time lord these things has been preached for so many times in the years and father sometime instead of bringing clarity and bringing lord confidence to your children it was a source of debate a source of confusion a source of clicks a source of things that came into the broad and divided the flock load but father you drop a different anointing that is bringing everything back to normal that now we understand that it was not a matter of discussion it was not a subject for me to get a debate online it was not a subject for me to argue it was not a subject for me to sit and to prove who's right or wrong but it was actually a subject speaking about me speaking about my rest speaking about the end of my trouble thinking about speaking about the end of my enmity with you speaking about the solution to all my life the completion of my work of redemption that now i know that my life is no longer in my hand but my life is in the hand of my maker who's controlling everything and who's working everything together for my good and now we could understand why brother brother could preach the message shalom and say little brother shalom be at peace because he's here i must decrease for him to be increased because he came down the presence of christ is here jesus christ is here he's taking care of every election [Music] and there is nobody that's going to be left just like joseph father when he unfolded himself to his brother he removed the anxiety they recognize that this is no more just a big ruler in egypt but this is our brother and when you unfolded this we understand that now we have not only a maker but we have a husband we have a brother we have a fellow here we have somebody we can share with him we can talk to him we can explain our trouble and somebody who understand us more than anybody on the face of the earth father if someone is struggling and went away from this rest and never lord father found this rest and the still lord father under the things of the world under the staff of the world under the politics of this world under the economy of this world and the lord father the worldly staff drinking smoking doing all kind of things father made they realize that there was a rest this is the complete rest that is filling and finishing the plan of redemption for the dental the door is still open they can come back and be partaker of this rest and they can rest also from their own work their own struggling nature and father make peace with you lord i pray if somebody's here that i have not done it may they examine their life and may this be an opportunity for them to come back home and to find this rest because it's still open father no matter how much joseph revealed himself to his brother he could not finish everything until benjamin come we cannot leave this world until the last elect made it home that's when everything will be finished lord your power is drawing those elected remember lord father if there is somebody sick here somebody that is struggling in the body lord may you touch them and heal them and may you bless your children and strengthen them and may you continue to unfold yourself more and more to your children as we commit everything and ask it in the name of jesus christ amen god bless your church brother [Music] [Applause] [Music] it was the best thing i've ever done we'll be dismissed as we sing this one more time hallelujah falling in love with jesus [Applause] falling in love with jesus [Music] falling in love with jesus it was the best thing i've ever ever done in his arms hallelujah [Music] in his arms i feel protected in his arms never disconnected in his eyes
