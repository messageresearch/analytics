nissi my victory so grateful for him this evening does anybody have a testimony on their heartless evening that they would like to share i know we have a prayer request brother david sent me church please pray for me and my husband we are leaving to visit family in alabama pray for a safe journey and that the light pray for a safe journey and my light to shine god's light sister hamilton so we'll just keep her in prayer she's asking for her light to shine to be a witness how many want to be witness wherever they go i want my light to shine does anybody else have a prayer request on their heart this evening okay is that your you said your brother okay your brother is in europe and he's sick we'll remember him in prayer this evening david could you come and lead us in a repair this evening let's bow our heads dear lord we thank you for all you've done for us for being with us and keeping us lord we know you are enough we know you are provider and you've already provided every answer for these requests we thank you for being with sister sharon's brother and make giving him a touch in his body lord be with the ones traveling to alabama this week lord and just be with us all to get our lights lit a little bit brighter lord we thank you for all you've done we pray you bless the service and we're just expecting because we know you if we're expecting we know you'll be here and you'll answer and you'll deliver we thank you for all you've done father god and we ask this in the name of jesus christ amen you all may be seated as they gather the offer you all just keep uh me and brother john and one for one brother robert fills in you all just keep us in prayer as song leader sometimes it's hard to find a balance of what's okay to sing and what's not okay to sing and because you'll see some of these people that sing some of these songs and they look they look really rough like you're like oh that's how could this be of god with the person that's singing it looks they're not living a life at all and sometimes it's hard to understand but but you know the gifts and callings are without repentance and the rain falls on the just and the unjust and like for the for instance this song it's directly out of scripture so if the scripture is anointed and somebody turns right out of the scripture like this part up here he's more than enough according to the power that worketh in us they get that from the scripture so whoever this writer is i believe that the anointing is on this writer so if we look past the singer or sometimes the music gets out of control in some of these songs but if you look to the words and that's the benefit of being able to bring it here in the church and sing it because you can just you can change the music and you can change the atmosphere but yet the words i believe are inspired so you just keep us in prayer i don't ever want to come up here and sing anything that's not pleasing to the lord and i know brother john doesn't i know brother robert doesn't so keep us in prayer as we as we study and we pray about what we what we sing and uh wish us our desire to get ourselves out of the way and allow the holy spirit to come come and and be the leader to the people and get us prepared for the word so does anybody have a special on their heart this evening i asked a couple on my way in and they said no so zaddy do you have one she was one of the people i asked and she said she didn't so i guess the lord put something on her heart praise the lord michael as well that's embarrassing it's okay um you know it's funny sometimes you may not want to do what the lord calls you to do based off of something simple as you know not feeling like you you know came in with the right attire or you know just something simple as that and then as we were worshiping it was just like you know what i forgot how great god has been to me especially recently with a lot of things that's been going on and just how he's been delivering me and just keeping me in a in a great state of mind and even recovering the joy of my salvation so i just want to sing a song to is the glory it's actually a song that i had um actually last year um and there's just kind of a list of songs that i've wanted to sing but just waiting for the right time and the right anointing so i pray this would be a blessing to you tonight it's just a small medley that i just want to sing to him this is coming from my heart straight to the lord i wanna give my best to you [Music] i want to do what you asked me to i want to go wherever you say say the words and i'll obey i want to live a life that's real i want to serve you lord for real for you love all this and more i give you more more more i give you more more i'ma try a different key go

awesome no matter how much more we give them it's never enough praise the lord everybody i should have given testimony earlier so i'm going to take the chance to do it right now for all the drivers out there on the road daily i just want to give god all the praise all the glory with all the accidents and trouble that's going on out there and we've been doing this for about almost 10 years now and he has kept me from many situations so i just want to give him praise for that he's worthy as brother berlin says that out there on the roads it's taken more lives and the first world war and the second world war together i can't on the note where zaddy was singing i have this song in my heart this week you can sing with me because i know you know it lord i want to be a christian in my heart

fellowship we've brought the child we sat down and it was like an ion sharpening another ion an ion sharpening another ion amen we stand there talk about the word talk about the word talk about the word until we have to part amen because he was so good we bless the lord for his goodness for everything he the travel back the family made a safe home so to the best of my understanding everybody that came into the wedding went home fine amen no accident no problem and we praise the lord for it amen blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah remember this coming sunday brother robert if i'm good we will have the building fund right on sunday so those that are not here that are streaming just remember this on coming sunday we have the building found offering lord's willing brother david was saying the text certain things we can't speak it right here because of youtube but you will receive a mass text in the message telling you about the progress of the church as far as what we need to do amen so just be on the loop you're going to receive a text message and it will tell you exactly what we need in church because we have certain things we have to do to make sure we ride on track everybody got it blessed be the name of the lord tonight i'm not preaching i'm starting coming up from the wedding so lord dwelling on sunday we're going to pick up we stop at the mystery of the weakness amen you remember that mystery part 41 god strength is expressed in that weakness amen yeah now you understand that what that a woman is not designed or created by the devil she was created by god but designed by perversion by the devil and we understand the two battle of wisdom and how god and satan are fighting and they use a woman as a by-product a weaker visa to express the plan of redemption amen without a woman the plan of redemption could be locked because the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world so it took the weakness of a woman to introduce the plan of redemption and he also took a woman to introduce the messiah god himself have to come through the channel of a woman let me tell you this message is the perfect message that can take a woman and bring her in her proper place to be respected with dignity and honor amen blessed be the name of the lord so we have brother bruce tonight maybe some of you don't know brother bruce i know him for a long time amen i heard him preach one time and brought the old raven church now it's brother mayangi and there is something that he spoke that always stuck with me when he was preaching he said that when israel got to the red sea there was a road there but it was only covered by water so that always stuck in my head for years don't know maybe 15 years since i heard him amen so i can remember so we made contact and have to go through brother mayangi and finally i got a hold of this precious jewel of the lord amen so he is home we don't have visitors so you are home you preach like home take your liberty and let's pull on the gift of the lord as we welcome him brother bruce with the song only believe this is his first time here but he is home by the truth take your liberty preach like home amen [Music] the whole things are yes lord we believe tonight hallelujah worthy is the lamb leaving yes all things are possible full lordly really lord i believe tonight oh i believe do you believe him now no i believe [Music] all things all things lord lord i believe you yes lord [Music] lord we believe you tonight we're gathered in thy name lord where two or three are gathered tonight god you said you were in our midst and father we believe it tonight god things are possible dear lord i believe hallelujah amen i believe he's worthy tonight amen he's worthy of us to to to gather he's worthy to give him all of our time he's worthy to give him everything that we are we found one word of the in this hour i mean we don't give it to a church we don't give it to an idea amen but i believe we found one word in this hour that we worship amen it's good to be here good to be in the house of the lord amen good to get to be in this in the presence of his people but stephen appreciate him amen uh 15 years ago or so that's a long time amen but my it's just it's good to be here this evening i'm not going to sing any more amen i bring greetings from brother scott smith and the assembly there and then he wanted to make sure i sent greetings down to brother stephen and the church and amen and amen amen it's just good to be in this presence amen looking around and see a few faces amen praise the lord well let's get into the into the scripture because i know that's what we come for hebrews the 10th chapter hebrews the 10th chapter hebrews the 10th chapter and i'm going to look there in the 35th verse i want to speak if i had to give it a title i'd lord laid it on my heart the unveiling of you amen the unveiling of you it would kind of be like the you know the road's already there but it just has to be unveiled amen i believe that that everything that that is supposed to be is is here we know that we know that the rapture is here we know that christ is is here we know that he's living in us we know that the rapture is in us we know him in the time that we're living in what's what's taking place but a lot of the things we don't naturally see but i believe as we walk it's being unveiled who we really are amen and i know the prophet said that maya when she recognizes she'll be an invincible army and i believe she is that invincible army i believe that she is an undefeated army i believe that she is one that's come with the savior this evening i believe she stands with a a warrior tonight that that lives in her putting on the whole armor of god brother brandon said he dressed himself in us and he's walking amen he's fulfilling his word this evening so with that in hebrews the 10th chapter and the 35th verse paul's speaking he says cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompense of reward for you have need of patience that after you have done the will of god how many believes you're doing the will of god amen how many believes you're doing the will of god [Music] he talked of jonah he said he was in the perfect will of god amen it's a mystery so he said have patience that after you have done the will of god ye might receive the promise for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarry so there's something that is that is being unveiled here now the just shall live by faith that just we know is it is the justified amen it's a people it's not just an idea or an attitude or or something but it is a it is a people that just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him now this i believe this is more than just paul speaking but i believe this is god speaking amen and he's he's making a division here between the just and everybody else he's he's he's unveiling who is what in this hour or we can say he's manifesting who we are amen and as the just are being manifested so are the others amen and so he said my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul dear heavenly father we just ask you tonight god lord that you let our minds be upon thee and our hearts be open unto you god lord let us forget everything that is behind us tonight and father as we enter into this secret place tonight god lord let every door be shut around us and father let us stand in thy presence alone god for lord we come god out of things lord that that lord in our own minds we might not understand father we've walked through things today this week god lord that be beyond our understanding father but god i pray in this place lord you'll make it known to us and father we commit it now into your hands lord this time that we have lord redeem in our time lord that it might be with you and you alone in jesus christ's name amen and amen you might be seated and as we look at this in hebrews the 10th chapter in the first verse paul says for the law having a shadow of good things to come amen so something is always coming something when you put a seed in the ground something's coming amen something has to people say well what kind of seeds you put in the ground well wait and see what seed it is jesus laid good seed in the ground one time his disciples wondered where the weeds come from amen and they asked shall we go ahead and tear them up he said no let them go until the harvest why because the lord of the harvest knew what seed he put in the ground see he wasn't worried about any circumstance on the outside that was going to interrupt the seed he knew his seed was good seed and listen saints in this hour is coming to harvest time and as we see everything beginning to bloom around us we know for a certainty we are confident in this one thing that the word of god cannot fail and that word of god is that good seed because that good seed was that original seed which was that spoken word and i believe that's where we come from amen so i believe that as the shadow of good things to come not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make comers there unto perfect and then as we looked here and we saw how that paul was getting down after he brought forth all the the separation for my take of the way the first that he might how did he establish the second how he's taken away one thing that he's bringing something better that he's that he's taken his you know something that was that was bringing us to a certain point just a shadow but he said it wasn't the very thing that he was looking for see god is it was looking for something the law couldn't do it because god was looking for fellowship but the law couldn't bring it he was looking to restore it back to what eden was and even pentecost brother brahm said couldn't do it amen because brother brahman said listen we're not going back to pentecost wow we're not going just back to some some sensation or some emotion or some idea but we're going back to the very beginning where we had fellowship with god himself and to where he could have fellowship with us amen why did he say it's not good that man should dwell alone because one day god knew that he was going to be a man see god made preparation amen that his word would manifest and that he would find pleasure in his word amen all things were created by him amen all things were created by him and they were also created for him amen all encompasses everything and including you and i we weren't created to live our own life to do our own thing to gather our own riches or wealth or our our natural blessings on this earth but we were created in the image and in the mind of god that we might be pleasing unto him we what is it we are the very the very desire of god's heart we're the very desire when he when we as we're being unveiled we're god is beginning god is beginning to see us now and we are beginning to see ourselves how he sees us amen it's the unveiling because watch now you know i've i've looked at it before and you know you look at and when god talked about ephesians he said it's his pleasure his pleasure not not my pleasure his pleasure now see when i have when i have a desire and that desire gets met then it becomes my pleasure amen when i desire you know maybe maybe a a piece of chocolate cake then when i get that it it becomes my pleasure when you desire something a deep calleth to the deep once you have received it then it becomes a pleasure and see god this this whole creation was was designed by god to fulfill his pleasure and so here we are the bride is created to fulfill his pleasure and so when paul said there in verse 38 and chapter 10 he said now the just shall live by faith the justified shall live by faith now you'll look over in romans as we see that just shall live by faith we'll go to romans 8 and 29 are we familiar familiar this evening and and i don't bring anything different but amen i trust the lord will just unveil what's there to us romans 8 and 29 for whom he did for no when did he foreknow us we all know before the foundation of the world he knew us he knew who we were he knew he'd be sitting here he knew what you'd go through today he knew what you'll go through tomorrow he knows everything about us he for knew who we were when god was there when he was elohim when he was sitting there he knew who he had us in his mind when he when he when my when he was sitting there thinking he was thinking of us amen you've got to realize for whom he did for no and he didn't just think about us but he also had the power that he did predestinate that also he did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son so he had a plan not to be conformed to an image of a church or an idea or a thought but to his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren so what he was we are wherever he goes amen we're going also for wherever the head goes the body follows so if he was predestined if he was foreknown if if he was slain before the foundation of the world there was a purpose and when he was raised up there was a reason amen and we're going with him tonight we're recognizing to be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate [Music] them he also called wow he had a plan he had a pla he didn't just you know brother brandon said he didn't hang on calvary hoping somebody feels sorry for him he didn't hang on caliber and hope we could get emotional some preacher could preach you into some some some you know persuades you to feel sorry for god because he hung on a cross and that you might get saved but see but when he knew you he predestinated you to be conformed to that image against your own better judgment you're coming to his penalty to his plan this evening so then he also quotes when he calls you he has a purpose and calling then he also called in whom he called them he called then he also justified and whom he justified now listen the just shall live by faith that justified shall live by faith and if we're living by faith then we're going to something that is unseen amen there's something that we're walking towards we're living by faith them he also glorified so this isn't the end of it he said be patient to sit in the end of it how many feels glorified amen in ourself we don't feel glorified amen we've got aches and pains and sickness and sorrows and depressions and and all kinds of disappointments but yet there's a glorification in our life amen that is drawing us to a place and as this word is spoken and lived it is calling to a bride this evening amen there's a sharp stone mason it is cutting us amen to unveil to us who we really are so hear the justice of my face so we see that we are going to a glorified state in mind i believe that the glorification is not even of us but it's what he thought of us now brother branham preached in the unveiling of god he says this after reading the scripture in second corinthians and and over in philippians talking about how that how that why that jesus christ thought it not robbery to be equal with god but took on himself of no reputation took on himself of of no reputation he wasn't going to be anything in this world he didn't want the name of this world he but then he comes down and he speaks this he says now i'm a subject this morning i trust that god will reveal this i trust that god will reveal this and each time if you who take the tapes and listen and i hope and trust that you have had a spiritual understanding of what that god has been trying to get over to the church without saying it right out there you know before when brother branham started this message you go back and listen to it he's he's talking about how that for for several months it seems god been dealing with him on this subject but out in out in the field he couldn't preach it because it it takes too long he said i try to keep it a 30-40 minutes out in the field he said but but here he come back to the tabernacle after he'd been out in tucson and he came back to the tabernacle and he said but now i've got the tape set up i've got everything and i'm wanting to to speak this and and and i'm i'm of the nature that believes that brother branham had no idea what was going on but i believe there was something inside of brother branham that was desiring to preach this not because he knew what it was but i believe god even under the even even bypassing man's understanding that god was speaking something to who not to even the tabernacle there but to a bride somebody because he comes down and his brother abraham's talking he said oh that those even that get the tapes see god doesn't stop in 1965. god didn't die back there amen but god even today when those tapes are played amen when we said under the presence of the preaching of the word amen it's not just a man or we don't gather under some idea amen but god said by the foolishness of preaching i've chose to save them which believe and whether we don't preach to save the unbeliever we preach to save them which believe why because under the power of the word under the beyond our understanding there's god is doing something in the midst of his word amen when the sun comes out the seed don't understand what it is but something down on the inside of is pulling out of him what does it want to do it's wanting to go back to where he come from oh saints we don't gather in church that everybody might see us but we gather in church amen that god is recognizing that the son has come out upon us and he has drawn us unto himself oh my we're not drawn to one another but we're drawn to the god in each other amen when light recognizes light amen we come together amen what does that omnipotent might meet and something's going to happen might not even be something we see but we are confident we are confident we are confident that what god won't lose a one of us amen that he's gonna he's not gonna lose before we get to glorification he's not gonna lose us and every step we take is getting us there every one of them brother talked about weakness amen in all of our weaknesses when paul said oh lord take this in permanency take this weakness away from me that infirmity we realized was a desire to be what paul couldn't be in himself because there was a life living down inside of paul that said yeah i'm dead yet i liveth why he said none of myself but by the faith of the son of god something in paul was living hold on something in his bride tonight is living her mind is bringing himself out it's bringing itself out and so here brother brandon he was saying look he said now of you that take the tapes of you that are here and you that are less than you that are he said you that had a spiritual understanding of what god has been trying to get over to the church without saying it right out see it's a thing sometimes we have to say things in such a way that it may thin down amen why because listen an unveiling is taking the unveiling is taking the sheet down and you see it the unveiling is also when that rock of of of of david or moses hell that that the great uh artist uh michelangelo was was was chopping away every every stroke that he took upon that rock amen it was beginning to show the unveiling of what was deeper in that rock amen we know that rock is a revelation it's not a revelation of a person or a church or anything but it's the revelation of who he really is amen and peter realized one day that might thou art the christ so we see that even even flesh and blood is not going to reveal this to us our flesh and blood is not going to bring about what god's wanting of us i don't know how to say it any other way our flesh and blood is not going to bring about what god wants of us we can we we can we can stand in front of the mirror all night and trying to make ourselves look perfect for god but it's not going to bring them about we can lay in the presence of this bible and read and read and read and read and read in our intellect and it's still not going to bring us to what god is desiring of us amen because if we're reading this thing hoping that we can prove somebody else wrong guess what amen but look because that we are we are that that's on the inside of us that opens the book and it is beginning to unfold to us see i don't we don't pick up this book trying to trying to learn or study or do anything we read this because my our lover left us a love letter oh my there's something inside of us that longs to be into contact with him amen if you ever got a letter from your lover hey man yo you'll know if they're far away on a in a foreign land amen you get that letter that's the closest thing you got to them so you'll pick you'll pick that letter up mine you'll begin to read that you'll smell that thing why because you're trying to get just a little bit of that that wrote the letter you're doing everything you're reading between the lines you're thinking about what were they doing what were they saying when they went to bed at eight o'clock what were they meaning when oh my when david slept over there with with my sheep but what is my lover trying to tell me what is he trying to show me what is he trying to deliver in this hour my lord what is it it's become because this thing is is beginning to come to us so watch now in that in that cutting away and that thinning down it it might bring some to go out it might have some to leave and some to ponder over see he's placing he's unveiling each one remember we said we're unveiling you the word has come to unveil who you are amen why do some why do some get mad and leave because that's who they are amen why do some fall back because that's who they are amen but the just or who they are they live by faith amen what is faith there's something down inside of you longing amen hebrews 11 chapter now paul paul laid out over there that the just are going to live my faith he talked about if you go back and read all of hebrews the tenth and you'll see my he's talking about the passing away of the law the bringing in of the the light and the the reality and but then he as all of that comes across but then he brings it down and we read how that that cast's not away therefore your confidence and the just shall live by faith faith and we are not of them who draw back unto perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul [Music] and how how how god had paul to write that because we'll look at it we say mother of the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him right there a lot of people will pick up doubt preacher will pick that up they'll they'll they'll run somebody into the ground thinking man you're falling back you're falling back you're doing this you're doing that you're doing this you're doing that and you're falling back but see paul comes right back around and speaks to the bride he comes right back and says but we are not of them see paul is showing he is discerning between the two so it's not paul it's the word and it's discerning the just lived by faith the ju everybody else falls back by the just now now in the unveiling of you then it becomes personal it's not about the unveiling of a church he's not unveiling a church tonight he's unveiling you you don't come together amen that we find out where the church is we come together under the power of the word standing in his presence lord who am i amen and then god begins to show who we are because as he speaks amen we begin to hear things others don't hear we begin to see things others don't see we begin to gather and desire things others don't desire because there's something down the inside of us ain't mean it was there before the foundation of the world it was god's foreknowledge spoken word amen and it's coming to pass in this hour it's a mystery it's a mystery how the two people can sit in church side by side and brother you know you've heard anything well he called me a buzz and he over here he called me an eagle amen but you know it's coming down into that hour where we're here and some people are hear themselves oh my i'll never make it i'll i'll never be no good i'll never do this i'll be falling back all the time but others hear my others here but we're not of those glory there i am there i am am i because the judge shall live there i am amen but we're not paul said we are not as many amen that pervert the word we're not who am i i'm not as many see we we hear different things others will read that love story and by they'll hear they'll hear the bad stuff hey remember the bride all she hears is the love letter to her heart she recognizes who he is so she sees herself in him this evening oh my oh my because watch now in hebrews 11th chapter hebrews 11 chapter verse 1. now faith is the substance that word we know is the realization it's the it's the real realization you know job looked at it one time and he said i've heard and i've heard and i've heard but now i see i've heard i've heard of her but but now i see because you're here and you're here and you're here and it doesn't change anything but when you see it changes everything i've heard the message i've heard the message i've heard the message i've heard the message but do you see the message see it's not a denomination that we're just getting to be a part of amen revelations 10 out there when he come down to another mighty angel he said who was they said that's none other than christ amen oh my the messenger was christ and so it come down to where listen we're not gathered around just just an idea we're not gathered around a thought we're gathered around a person amen and and watch now because here he says now faith is the s the realization of things hoped for the realization oh just you know outside that door we could say you know there's there's a new car and more you can start imagining you could almost get excited you could almost shout and jump and sing songs about it come on you'd start testifying glory to god there's a car out there for me but something could happen along the way somebody could beat you to the door and all of a sudden your hopes would be smashed you'd be depressed you know you might you might trip break your leg not be able to get there your phone might ring somebody get you on the line and then you know it's kind of like the pull of bethesda see there was a hope of oh if if i can get there oh if i ca or if i can just and see that's where the church has been under for seven ages if we can do anything oh my we want to do our best but all alone there's been something about a bride in this hour he's pulled the veil off of who god was but when he pulled the veil off of who god was it began to show her who she was because we find over in revelations over there in the fifth chapter when john got the veil pulled off and he recognized who he really was amen in all of heaven under earth everybody above earth everybody in heaven heard out john saying why because brother brown said he saw when that book was crossing the hands he said i saw my name there what was it is the realization oh saints is the realization that we've already made it it's the realization amen there's nothing can stop us now it's the realization amen as the quarter is in my hand amen it's better than that because faith is that substance to realization that's why he said what cast not assigned that confidence the realization and there's we're not we're not as paul said we're not as many but by believing this hour we are those that the justified are living by this faith faith is not just a hope so or something i learned in the bible and i now believe because he said it 2 000 years ago faith is what he tells you now faith is what he's told us now because god's not dead he still speaks amen he still speaks to our heart he still tells us hey man when you walk into service he'll still tell you you're going to be healed this evening or you're or this is going to happen or or that's going to happen and then it happens see faith is the realization that it's not oh if i can hang on long enough faith is i'm already glorified faith is and this this is a stickler and listen it's sitting for everybody but it's for the justified faith is no matter what happens or what i do i've already made it that's hard because you know we all say well you're going to take that and you're going to live any old way you want to and people tell me i've had people tell me you're going to have people living and sin i said no i'm gonna have chickens jumping off the cliff and dying oh my but the eagle will never fall at the word of god the eagle will take the true word of god and she'll fly with it she'll go where she was destined to go amen there's no fear no doubt no pulling back on this thing we don't pull back and say we're glorified into the very presence of god then pull back and say but wait he might not want me no listen we're going on in because god has said we wanted us oh man you've heard it in your heart and there's a realization that nothing's going to stop me now oh my david said in this one thing i'm confident come on preach the rapture on that why did the prophet of god pick up and preach preach a rapture on that over in psalms why because it's the confidence oh my that it's not in my ability that i'm taking a rapture it's in my confidence that in what god is saying amen he will fulfill in our life oh my the church has made us doubt for years the church has called us disappointment for years but i believe christ is coming this hour amen that he might find a bride ready [Music] and she is getting the understanding she's recognizing she's like moses when he walked up to the red sea bro steven he's he saw that road god unveiled that road to him and he said why stand you here speak and go forth oh my this bride is now speaking she is now testifying again prophesied why because she has the word she knows what he wants done with him amen oh my we're not of the kind that's backing up saints we're not backing up into some denomination it says you better be careful we're walking into the very presence of almighty god where he careth for us oh bride listen listen hebrews it's the faith is the very substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report and through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god listen we didn't read it and just believe it [Music] but we were there oh my when that logos was a circling where were you amen when when that first clinker went off where were you don't back up on me now where were you where were we where was this bride look this is in the message listen where were we through faith we understand why not because we read and understand and it sounds good but because he told us he showed us and we were there oh that's why the world don't understand us we're framed by the word of god so that things which are seen that we see others might not be seeing them little bride but you're seeing them they're going back and they're saying all right there's nothing to it there's nothing to it but we're still walking why because we've seen it we're not made of things which do appear in other words what we're seeing is not by things that are appearing around us but they are created and made by he that is unseen but yet he's speaking and talking and showing this little bride who she is amen and look in verse four and that's i want to get here and now we're trying not to hold too long once by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent a more excellent sacrifice how many likes excellent and excellent a more excellent sacrifice lord have mercy to think that by faith you know brother said faith is a revelation and no man is going to teach you this no man's going to teach but so who gives you a revelation i just want you to realize who's talking to you oh my i just want us to realize who's talking to us that's why brother branham said oh you that are spiritual in heaven and have an understanding he said without coming right out and saying it then when you pick up this bible and you're reading and it's telling you who you are you're hearing that tape and it's telling you who you are listen it's not some seventh grade educated kentuckian it's not some man we're not feeding on a man amen but there's something that is still and if we only realize who's telling us these things if we only realize the one that's brought us this far if we only realize the one that's showing us these things if we only realize who he really is amen that we can begin to realize who we really are glory glory if we only realize who's talking to us oh my who wakes you up in the middle of the night who talks to you throughout the day who draws you into his presence who calls for you to step amen when he tells you esther step forward when he lays out that scepter of his promise to you who is it is talking to us oh it's not some church thought amen but this is the very son of man of god come down made flesh among us in this hour where is he ah the realization of this bride is beginning to understand now oh my we ain't been listening why does everybody else go because all they can see is a man amen but she don't see the man she hears the god oh my the same one when she was there at the beginning of time when he was throwing stars out across the universe i mean that same voice is talking to her now oh my the same god why do you think before those seals could be opened he had to come down and restore the word back to the spoken word because this thing's not coming on a written word it's coming on a spoken word human education human ability human and smartness can read a word however it takes a supernatural god amen to speak a word oh and then it come to pass all saints if we'd only realize whose presence we're standing in if we only realize oh my this isn't some church you're gathering in but this is under the power of the word then when we gather on wednesdays and sundays amen we're standing under the power of god all to realize that we come and god is beginning to unveil us that we might see oh and it was excellent oh my that wasn't paul speaking that wasn't paul saying that his his his offering under god was that more excellent that was god saying that's excellent boy he put the seal of approval said that's excellent that's an excellent sacrifice than cain by which by watch now by which he obtained witness he obtained witness i want you to now go and you go into the court of law with me because a witness has to see something glory a witness has to see something he obtained somebody stood in the court of law and said do i have a witness and somebody stood up in abel's defense and said i'll stand and give witness oh my saints when we begin to realize oh they said some story you learned in sunday school oh but this is the very life of god being revealed in this hour this is the very presence of god coming down and making his bride realize who she is oh the world will keep going in church the world will keep running in the nomination but oh that little bride oh my she's obtained witness in this hour she has obtained witness in this hour oh glory to god now who's the witness that he was righteous god testifying glory oh brother so-and-so didn't say you were good enough oh but god testified oh that i am satisfied oh that my desire is met with your sacrifice oh oh but it's more than that saints oh it's more than that it's more than god just saying oh that's a good sacrifice that's more than god just saying eyewitness that's a good sacrifice that's more than him testifying go with me over into genesis go with me over to genesis look over here in revelations in the third fourth chapter and we see where paul picked it up and god was speaking through paul and he said in the first verse and adam knew eve his wife and she conceived and bear cain and said i had gotten a man from the lord and she again bear his brother abel and abel was a keeper of sheep but cain was a tiller of the ground and in process of time remember be patient be patient because in the process of time listen cain cain didn't just get mad at abel at one instance cain was building this anger at abel over a long time because abel was living a different life than cain was well they might have been walked they might have been coming to church with mom and dad they mean they might have been sitting at their feet at dinnertime and listening to mom and dad tell about the story in the garden they might have been hearing about what the serpent did and what god did and how he brought a sacrifice or gave him a lamb's clothe but in the preaching of that word somebody was hearing something different in that church service amen while he was unveiling who cain and abel really were it was beginning to show who they were it was beginning to unveil and that's oh my oh that's what made kane so mad that's why he turned around despised his brother abel whole mind because abraham he came with a different kind of sincerity and one day in the process of time when it was time to manifest what they had been hearing and when it comes time to manifest what all we've been hearing when it comes to a showdown when it come time for faith to speak expressly when it come time for something to be expressed something to be unveiled something to be shown amen it come in a process of time so be patient and able now watch it and in the present time it came to pass that cain brought of the fruit of the ground and offering unto the lord he came to church and gave his offering oh my brother brown said they both come to church they both did everything that my they they both worshipped am i oh you can't compare and look somebody one way somebody's a worshiper and just because somebody may be louder or something than you or doing something more that don't mean it's a worshipping god because the devil comes to church to worship the devil oh man he'll sing louder in the next guy come on he'll hey man shout sometimes louder i don't mean i'm going to quit shouting in amen and glory amen abel didn't stop worshiping just because cain was worshiping he didn't draw back he didn't draw back because somebody might think he's being a false devil oh no because when he come in the process watch now and once cain cain brought his offering unto the lord and then abel he also brought to the first things of his flock into the fat thereof and the lord had respect now the lord's not a respecter of persons but he is a respecter of his word come on he is a respecter of his word and he recognizes his word he recognizes when his word is returning unto him he recognizes when he is getting an amen according to the word oh he's not he's not now watch that word respect if you look it up you'll find out that word respect means to stare upon whoo to look at to notice i'll bring it up in the new testament to witness oh my god witnessed oh my something that caught his attention when abel look god was sitting up there in heaven and he was sitting there watching king brought up all the first slings of his are all the best fruits the biggest pumpkins the greatest squash amen the biggest worship he could ever brought and god was just looking off but all of a sudden he heard the blinking of a lamb and the blood running out he turned in the twinkling of an eye he looked and he saw abel and god right there respected he saw a something called god's attention oh my something that had been covered something that had been healed something that was unseen even god looked and saw that sacrifice what was he seeing he was seeing the understanding of that word that when that when adam and eve were standing up there preaching the word somebody was hearing oh my somebody was realizing oh my somebody was realizing when adam was telling him about the day he come home whole mind and god wasn't there anymore and they run off into the trees and adam was telling him all about the time that now they sowed they worked night and day [Music] pulling leaves off of trees hoping to find good grace to god working herself to death trying to sew up some aprons working herself to death hoping they'd find the cover and good enough to satisfy god but one day when god come looking he couldn't see him come on he couldn't see him oh my because he was looking for something god is looking for something inside he's not looking for anything well he's not looking for just any church he's not looking for just any woman he's looking for his wife oh my god so god said adam where art thou adam and run off out there showing lit fig leaves doing everything he could in church and god didn't see him but finally finally adam comes shaking up here we are laura it's my wife she she told me she turned around and said well it's a servant beguiled me god throwed the sacrifice on what was it adam was telling cain and abel this story came just he was still enamored with the fig leaves he said i wonder how in the world he sewed them together i wonder you know kane his mind would drift in church and thinking about them fig leaves and my but i i see he think about the figs you know maybe the fruits that was growing on the fig tree you know he started to think about the beautiful fruits and see he began to unveil who he really was amen but abel he constantly he'd go out there and he'd look at them sheep he was attending to oh my daily he began to think and he began to grow he began to realize that what that sheep was all about he began to realize that there was more than just some pet he began to realize it's more than just some clothing he began to realize it was more than just some attire or dress amen but he began to realize that was his savior he began to realize that was the very desire of god amen that he might have fellowship and what was it abel desired fellowship [Music] oh my why because that was what was poured into him from his father he wanted fellowship with god again he wanted god to recognize him he wanted god to see him oh prophet of god told a story about that little girl standing on the street corner waving at the queen and the king rolling by she's over there just to crying and going on and daddy said did you not see her she said oh yeah i saw her but i don't know if she saw me see that's where it is to the believer she don't get up and dance trying to trying to trying to trying to just see him she wants what him to see her oh my what is that's the desire of her heart that's the desire of her heart is that oh lord that you'd see me so he said there what was it unto abel and his or he had respect in other words what was unseen became seen was it something that you couldn't see now become visible now the greek word there that form i've been looking for it all day yesterday trying to think of it was and i find coming with this word in in morphe now we all know this here it's spelled and he goes on and spells it looking in the greek to find out what in morphe was i may pronounce that wrong but the reason i spelt it when if a tape is released the people with scholars will know what i mean by it we don't have to be a scholar to know what he means by it amen he said when if tape was released and scholars said know what i mean he said when in a morphe that means that he changed his self he come down now the greek word there means that something that could not be seen yet it's there and then it's changed and the eye can catch it amen now something that's not there something that's veiled or covered but when a morphe comes it takes that unseen and makes it visible amen so watch now watch now in paradox brother brahm talks about he said now it's a paradox i believe that the same god that fell on the day of pentecost upon his church was a pillar of fire and divided himself with cloven tongues among his people is here tonight it's the same god he was then he is today with the same holy ghost i know it's a paradox it cannot be explained emotion screaming crying and so forth cannot be explained but it's a paradox how god does it it's the unseen god dwelling in the human heart making his self visible by vindicating his word what is the vindicated word is when the word that it spoke comes to pass when it's manifested then it becomes light thus it's vindicated so we're listen when when when the word when god is speaking and somebody is hearing then when that begins to come to pass when we are patient and wait and we see it it's vindicated but who's doing the vindicating it's not us it's in more faith god living in us so we see that it's listen we live by faith because we're justified because we realize oh my this ain't me doing it you know we often say it's not listen it's not the preacher preaching then it can't be the listener listening [Music] amen [Applause] amen oh glory oh my see it's not god on the platform but it's god in your heart and when he hears his word whom i respond so what is he saying he's saying abel i see you who am i and it's abel speaking back to god saying i see you and now it's what it's to having fellowship now we're not alone anymore now it's god in us living through us oh saints is not us walking anymore the church has walked age after age not knowing this but in this hour god has pulled his little bride to his side and began to tell her the secrets of her heart lord why do i feel this way i got a message for you oh oh god why did this happen i'll tell you lord where's my life like this let me show you oh my you're sinning church and god talks to you oh god thank you lord see pentecostal wants to take all the attention just to healing but god wants to vindicate his word to your heart or this bride is recognizing oh my this isn't just a church and i'm not just another person but i'm his the unveiling the unveiling coming together miles let's bring it down right here i want to read in timothy timothy i'm gonna bypass a few things i'll read this in a second timothy why god tell me tell us lord what second timothy chapter three and verse three we know the in the end to be perilous times but i want you to look at something because there was something about adam that god looked at and saw and had respect too amen second timothy chapter three and verse 33 without natural affection truth breakers talking about the end time false accusers and consonant fierce watch think of cain and abel now despisers of those that are good listen read the word for what it says and hear it and realize those that are good they don't despise you because you do good he said well they don't like me because i wear a skirt no that's not why they don't like you oh they don't like me because i'm in a message no that's not why they don't like you they don't like me because i go to church all the time though that's not why they like don't like you they don't like you because you are good there's a big difference between doing good and being good amen why because jesus comes when a rich young ruler runs up to jesus said good master jesus turns around and says there's none good but god now we're beginning to see it clearly now it's beginning to unveil who we really are oh they don't hate you because you're a goody two they don't hate you because you're packing a message they don't hate you because you wear this or do that they hate you because you are god glory they hate you because of why the creator has come down to take possession of his earth they hate you because god has come to claim that which is rightfully his he paid it on calvary but now he's come to claim it or when will they hate you when will they turn everything against you oh my when in these end times in these perilous times oh saints they don't hate us just because we go to church [Music] they hate you because they don't because you're god brother branham are you god but you're not far off you're not far off because where where were you part of him [Music] way back in his mind [Applause] where'd you come out of it in that logos and when that thing was spinning where'd he put you he put you in this hurt all right let it get covered up he let it get forsaken looking oh my but he had a plan for you oh man he said one day i'm going to call him i'm going to call him out of that earth i'm going to call him like i did lazarus i'm going to call him from the very scroll amen that i rode in heaven i'm going to have a roll call one day oh mine is that word is circulating the earth right now and it's calling for this bride it is calling for her to come stand by sight everybody's hating her everybody's despising her why am i because they don't understand they don't hear the voice oh but her mom's so good what do you mean you're god what do you mean you're good in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god in the beginning when the word spoken he said let there be and there was he turned right around and he testified not i he testified there let there be light he saw the light it was good glory he's looking down in this hour and he's seen something good when he looked at abel's sacrifice he saw something good he had respect oh my brother ma'am said the women in this world have lost respect because the way they act however this little man has got respect of god because of who she is oh don't you love him tonight let's turn to our feet this evening oh my to think god has veiled himself when i go to church it's not i listen when i hit play on a tape it's not me listening oh but it's god hearing god oh when we go to work and they hate us oh when we go to the store and they hate don't think it's your ability to put on a skirt don't think it's your ability to grow long hair don't think it's your ability just to pack a book don't think it's in that brother branham said over there in perfect strength perfect weakness he said you've got to master human ability and you've got none everything we got is god or else we don't have anything oh but i'm so glad he's testified i'm so glad he had witness i'm so glad he saw me one day [Music] glory and he saw us down in the end time he saw us and he made sure when this thing was coming to harvest that it wouldn't fail oh my listen we're not of those that draw back [Music] james said be careful for nothing [Music] be careful for nothing david said in this one thing i'm confident all that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life what david said oh that i might recognize myself and his presence and by doing that i'm confident paul picked it up and said now don't cast away your confidence don't count don't cast away the thing that is who we are and that's god don't substitute it's something you've done but it's something he's done i didn't make a good choice one day to serve god god made a good choice because everything he does is good who chose you he don't mess up listen tonight before you let he don't mess up [Music] he never messes up he never makes a mistake because he's perfect he said oh i'm not worthy praise god we're getting somewhere glory human ability we've got none but god's looking at his word that lives in us my justified as though you never did it justified let's buy his heavenly father oh god just to have conference with you to speak and you hear and you speak and we're here oh god we thank you that tonight you've come lord you've spoken lord the world would not even recognize us we're just gathered in a a room but lord they still hate us because there's an unseen there's a presence lord that lives in us there's a testimony that that we don't testify but you testify god we found witness in this hour it doesn't matter what others say what do you say god lord no no wife would worry about what another man would say she worries what her husband would say oh god we just lord there's none other but you for we found the one worthy in this hour for you've revealed yourself in us you've unveiled who we are in you lord christ has been unveiled lord this bride is being unveiled piece by piece lord she's being seen now lord as you stand there looking upon her [Music] you're watching and you're seeing that perfection that you thought of you're looking at your word god and it's coming into plain view now she's beginning to see now who who she really is [Music] she's not she's not just somebody that goes to church and lord tries to do good for god you made her good before the foundation of the world father we're so grateful

hear you for lord we finally found one worthy to listen to for you've never lied to us you've never made promise that wasn't true [Music] and god you've never left us you've always been with us god i pray this hour god as this unveiling continues lord is even in the the brothers said he's been preaching on the perfect strength and our weakness lord i believe it's clearer now for we love you because you first loved us we thank you father we commit all this into thy hands now every need lord we know that you've met it for you promised you would you said you by the fullest as a preacher and you'd save them which believe so we cannot doubt tonight before we realize it was not just a group of people coming together but it was god's word being fulfilled god we thank you for it bless every hand of every musician lord bless the song leaders god that they might be inspired to sing of thy truth god bless the deacons every officer and lord each one that would sit in a pew order and a seat father let it be granted and god will be sure to always give you all the honor and the glory and the praise in jesus christ's name amen and amen brother stephen amen [Music] let's sing that because he first loved me i love him i [Music] he first laughed [Music] [Music] hallelujah hallelujah how many enjoy the word of the lord tonight amen hallelujah as you continue to play that softly you know church i told you several times [Music] i say put your car in neutral amen when brother bruce started he says that the law was something that was always pointing to something to come and there has been a time in our life that temporarily i'm not boasting but i'm just telling you so you know what happened i'm not boasting but i'm just telling you so you know what happened god permitted us to be somewhere temporarily almost like under the law but that was not what god was looking for amen god heed something and what he hid was what you were lacking in your life to bring you exactly where he wanted to you amen that's why we were going and it seems like things were not changing it seems like things were getting harder and harder in our life like we can't get victory on what we were doing we were on the first step amen but god came and shook everything away amen he allowed that chaos to happen so that god can pull you out to bring you the unveiling of the word and the word unveiling unto you begin to talk to the word that was always laying in you amen and now the message become clear and you begin to understand things better it has nothing to do with brother stephen there are stuff that are preached here that are never seen before there are things that i continue to see day and day that i never seen before it is not me it is god preaching through the preacher and in god in you listening to himself [Music] amen will begin to pull you in church every day what makes you to have joy to come to church they say churches at two o'clock everybody's there at two o'clock it is not you it is god coming to listen to god and when two omnipotent meets the guarding you and the god in the preacher then the miraculous begin to take place don't force yourself to quit something just lay put your car in neutral get united with the world and you're gonna see later but later things begin to be chipped away in your life without any effort and all will be based on faith which is given by grace and paul says so nobody can boast hallelujah it's gonna be all grace that's the reason why certain things has been tougher amen it is god ambushing you hallelujah you have been praying for something it is not working god knows that if he give it to you now you cannot handle it that's why he ambushed you and all your impurity all your anger all your religious spirit all your proud everything begin to come up on the surface amen because remember all these need to be cleaned up on the first banquet before you go to the second one amen you cannot destroy a man with the first banquet in the first banquet airmen was sitting and he was happy god have to bring ambush that's why you listen to the word you listen to the word and you find yourself in a high anger don't get discouraged it is god letting that anger come up to show you that you are weak what you thought you were strong you were in the message i knew the message i was strong i was this and this and this god is destroying and pulling you down until you look you say it seems like i need to start all over again he said yes that's what i want you to amen so now you're not going to be boasting in a legalistic way because we have too much proud too much i i've been in this message i was born in the message i did this i did this i did this then god come and crush you down you want to do something it's not working you want to do something it's not working he's bringing you to give preeminence to his word amen amen forget about a church forget about and belong to this church i'm going to this forget about it it is you and god individually amen if you unite to god the god in you will help the one next to you in the churches we were worrying about everybody and we forgot about ourselves we can preach everybody and we forget about ourselves now this is not the time this is the time to preach at yourself to look at your life yourself to be a light yourself amen and before you know it you're going to look at your necks and you see him just like you because he is interested in his own life you worrying about your life the preacher worrying about his life and finally when we walk in the light then we have fellowship very easy my brother very easy the word coming is not the christianizing you it is god the mercy that is unfolding the true you and any impurity from the denominational spirit in the message that religious demon in the message that made you treat a woman like a slave god is ambushing all of that amen until you recognize i am the one that need help i'm not going gonna blame nobody i'm not gonna blame nobody amen because the word has been laying there in tips and books all along it is up to you to take that word fellowship with the word and you're gonna see things that you've never seen before amen god working in you god working in a musician god working in a deacon god working in a preacher god working in a song leader and all of that will be god in all and nobody have to take credit but god himself and he's gonna respect you he's gonna testify you he will be the one vindicating you amen you don't have to do anything we did that for years i hope the ministry are catching the turn in the message ministry now it is not religious it is not church it is not intellectualism it is not sitting arguing about doctrine we had that for years and the people did not even know what they were believing god now is pushing that all aside he wanted his bride he's coming to take his bride home god is not playing game anymore church god is not playing games anymore if you don't listen he's going to squeeze you all the way until you surrender and through your weakness then he is strong because his strength is made perfect in weakness amen you got off don't be upset it is just god telling you there is still an area here that you need to work on don't beat yourself down i got upset i got upset no god is telling you you still have a problem with your temper and how do you do it brother branham sweeten your temper with prayer then he chipped it off and something else pop up it is only god keep telling you i am just pointing out the infirmities because this is homegoing town no more time that he men must die body bruce god bless you wonderful service thank you very much and thank you for yielding to the spirit of god amen i'm going to let brother hebrew go ahead and sing one song and you can pray for dismissal church god bless you we love you continue in prayer continuing consecration don't force anything put your car in neutral depend on god fully and god who started the work will finish it until the day of jesus christ go ahead brady able amen amen church if you're not convinced that we only have one preacher in this church and that's the lord jesus christ i don't know what else it's going to take after he comes and ministers that we have brother chad go through the timeline of god and the sacrifice of the lamb and then that abel by by faith abel offered up to god a more excellent sacrifice then we have brother bruce come right behind him same thing even mentions esther just one thing after another we see just the lord
