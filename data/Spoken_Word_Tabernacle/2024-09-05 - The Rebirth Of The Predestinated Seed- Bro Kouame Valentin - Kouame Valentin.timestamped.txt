[1:34:37] age
[1:34:41] Hallelujah brother say now we reach a
[1:34:46] conclusion as the logos Eternal
[1:34:50] God was manifested in the son
[1:34:56] and in Jesus Christ dwelleth the
[1:34:58] fullness of the godhead
[1:35:02] bily because that Eternal being was the
[1:35:05] father manifested in
[1:35:07] flesh receiving a ttle as a
[1:35:10] son the same thing for
[1:35:17] us we who were Eternal in his thoughts
[1:35:23] our turn we
[1:35:25] become we become the seed spoken words
[1:35:29] hallelujah
[1:35:32] hallelujah we become the seed spoken

[1:36:06] amen let me
[1:36:08] finish and those Eternal
[1:36:11] thoughts that are now manifested in
[1:36:14] flesh are sons of
[1:36:17] God that's how we are
[1:36:19] called we are called the sons of God
[1:36:24] the daughters of
[1:36:28] God we never became
[1:36:31] seed by the new
[1:36:35] birth we were fres
[1:36:38] seed that's the reason why we can be
[1:36:42] born

[1:36:48] can be born
[1:36:49] again talk to me about predestination
