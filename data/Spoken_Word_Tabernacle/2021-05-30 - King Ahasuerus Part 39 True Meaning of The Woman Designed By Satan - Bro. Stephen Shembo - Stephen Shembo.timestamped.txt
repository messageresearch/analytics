[41:57] up to date up to date up to date
[42:01] praise god i don't want to lose anybody
[42:04] amen all right we already finished
[42:08] proverbs 7.
[42:10] that should be clear lord's willing at
[42:12] the end of the service just remember
[42:15] the building funds offering today
[42:18] and also for those that requested the
[42:20] cod we already bought them and some of
[42:23] you already got them
[42:24] but if you have not gotten them yet at
[42:26] the end of the service
[42:28] you can see the trustees but my daily or
[42:31] brother chimp they can hand you
[42:33] the cod so now remember we spend money
[42:36] on this it's an investment
[42:38] all i'm asking you is at least one
[42:41] question a day
[42:42] just one if i say two three it's gonna
[42:45] be a burden for somebody
[42:47] just at least one question a day one
[42:50] question
[42:51] one answer a day so by the end of the
[42:54] month you should have
[42:55] 30 questions and 30 answers if you do
[42:58] that in two months you're going to see
[42:59] how much
[43:00] you're going to be progressing and
[43:02] you're going to be growing
[43:03] with the lord amen i can give you the
[43:06] answer
[43:07] which we will continue to do but i want
[43:09] you to begin to learn
[43:11] from the source that we're getting in we
[43:14] are not the catholic church where the
[43:15] priests have a different
[43:17] book versus the congregation here
[43:20] we use the same bible and the same
[43:23] message
[43:23] amen but i don't want you to get lazy
[43:26] i want you to be working on your own i
[43:29] want you to put a tip
[43:30] and know how you can clean something
[43:32] from the tab
[43:33] i want you to learn how to read your
[43:35] bible i want you to learn how to go to
[43:37] the prophet and say
[43:38] we heard about this is there any place
[43:41] in the message where
[43:42] brother branham spoke about this then
[43:44] when you begin to study
[43:46] then the lord will open up to you if
[43:48] you're not interested on what the lord
[43:50] is doing
[43:51] he's not going to come and tell you the
[43:53] meaning of what his word is
[43:55] is actually so you gotta be interested
[43:59] convinced then concerned
[44:02] amen blessed be the name of the lord
[44:05] let's go to our reading
[44:08] i trust by the grace of god we're going
[44:10] to reach the point
[44:12] because the last time we we stopped
[44:14] where
[44:15] the woman was designed by the devil
[44:18] you remember that amen
[44:22] so there are many theories in the
[44:23] message
[44:25] amen so we had to go back to proverbs 7
[44:29] to um
[44:33] we will see how the lord will lead and
[44:35] make sure
[44:36] we get into this completely amen
[44:40] genesis chapter 2. when brother polycarp
[44:44] touched chapter 3 i say okay that's my
[44:46] confirmation
[44:48] that i'm in the right line amen
[44:51] a wonderful sermon on wednesday if you
[44:54] were not there you need to go back and
[44:56] listen to it
[44:57] it's a blessing upon blessing brother
[44:59] darrell brother polycarp and it will
[45:01] continue to unfold amen
[45:04] genesis chapter 2 verse 7. make sure you
[45:07] don't sleep
[45:08] because i will remind you
[45:11] amen this is in the morning it's not
[45:13] even wednesday night
[45:14] or evening where you are tired from work
[45:17] this is
[45:18] fresh so make sure you don't sleep
[45:20] especially young people
[45:23] genesis chapter 2 verse 7. if you're
[45:26] there you can say amen
[45:28] and the lord god form a man we know that
[45:31] man was already created in genesis 1 26
[45:34] we already clear on that one
[45:36] and the lord god formed men of the dust
[45:39] of the ground
[45:40] this is the natural the physical man
[45:43] and breathed into his nostril the breath
[45:46] of
[45:46] life and man became
[45:50] a water a living soul
[45:54] right here you might be seated god
[45:57] already created the earth
[46:00] and when god created the planet earth
[46:05] gotta kill it this is not working
[46:08] probably run out
[46:14] where is brother kelly it shall be
[46:15] somewhere
[46:18] amen all right let me continue when god
[46:21] created the earth
[46:23] the earth was already filled with the
[46:26] animal we know in genesis 1
[46:28] it tells you how god created the
[46:31] the botany life the animal life and
[46:34] everything
[46:34] and the fishes and all this kind of
[46:37] stuff now
[46:38] right here god created man not the
[46:41] spiritual man but the natural man
[46:43] out of the earth and the bible says as
[46:46] we're waiting on those uh
[46:47] sharpies on uh verse eight thank you
[46:50] sister
[46:52] appreciate it i'm glad you knew where
[46:55] that was
[46:56] amen god created the earth we have
[47:00] planet earth
[47:02] the planet earth is already filled here
[47:04] everybody clear
[47:06] verse 8 and the lord planted
[47:09] a garden eastward in eden so there is
[47:13] a certain location on the earth
[47:16] that location is called eden
[47:19] anybody clear then inside the eden
[47:23] everybody clear so far
[47:25] god planted a garden toward the east
[47:29] so we can put it here like there is a
[47:32] garden somewhere here
[47:34] which one we call the garden of eden
[47:38] amen verse 8 and the lord god planted
[47:41] a garden eastward in eden
[47:45] and there he put man whom he had formed
[47:49] now if you look right here you have
[47:51] three circles
[47:53] we have the earth itself then we have
[47:56] the region
[47:57] of eden which was connected to the
[47:59] region of nad
[48:01] which way was where uh can when
[48:04] and that's where the lineage of cain
[48:06] lived and then inside
[48:08] of hidden there is the garden of eden
[48:12] amen there is a first circle there is a
[48:15] second circle
[48:17] and there is a third circle everybody
[48:19] clear so far
[48:21] amen so the earth was the other court
[48:25] i hope you are seeing that everybody
[48:28] clear so far
[48:29] then eden was the holy place
[48:32] everybody cleared so far then the garden
[48:36] of eden
[48:37] was the holy of the holiest
[48:40] anybody clear because that's where the
[48:42] lord
[48:43] descended inside and that's where they
[48:46] carry them well
[48:48] that's why when moses made the
[48:50] tabernacle
[48:51] he put the caribbean on the holy of the
[48:54] holiest
[48:58] everybody cleared so far the opening of
[49:02] the seventh year
[49:03] the bible became anew praise god
[49:07] hallelujah and out of the ground
[49:10] verse 9 out of the ground
[49:14] made the lord god to grow every tree
[49:17] this ground
[49:18] is not the ground of the earth
[49:22] everybody this is the ground
[49:25] of the garden of eden
[49:28] everybody clear because god already
[49:31] filled the earth with animal
[49:33] with vegetation with fishes and all
[49:35] kinds of stuff
[49:37] but god just created a natural man
[49:40] and now his creation he he's
[49:43] making a home for that natural man
[49:47] and that home was in the holy of the
[49:50] holiest
[49:51] that's where god wanted men to live
[49:56] not in the other court not in the holy
[49:59] of holi
[50:00] in the holy place but in the holy of the
[50:03] holiest
[50:05] so now it's another creation within the
[50:08] creation
[50:11] everybody clear he is creating the
[50:14] garden of eden
[50:17] hallelujah and out of the ground the
[50:20] ground of eden
[50:22] may the lord god to grow every tree
[50:25] that is water pleasant to the sight
[50:29] and that is water so in the
[50:32] in the earth there was all kind of trees
[50:34] here on the outside
[50:36] but the trees in the garden of eden were
[50:40] different the tree of the garden of eden
[50:45] were
[50:45] first what pleasant to the eyes
[50:50] and number two they were water they were
[50:53] also good for food
[50:55] everybody clear good for food amen
[50:59] if you leave the garden of eden you go
[51:02] outside
[51:03] then you can find all kinds of trees you
[51:05] can find
[51:06] field trees that are combustible good
[51:09] for food
[51:10] or you can find trees that are not
[51:12] combustible
[51:13] they are not good for food but
[51:15] specifically
[51:16] inside the garden of eden every single
[51:20] tree
[51:21] was water and water
[51:25] even the tree of knowledge of good and
[51:29] evil
[51:29] [Music]
[51:34] everybody cares of her that tree also
[51:38] was water
[51:41] and it was water do you believe it
[51:45] do you believe it do you want to see
[51:48] that in the bible
[51:51] you want to see that in the bible
[51:55] keep your finger right there let's go to
[51:57] genesis 3
[52:00] because i'm going to read there anyway
[52:04] everybody clear job to verse 6
[52:07] and when the woman saw that the tree
[52:12] of the knowledge of good and evil was
[52:13] water
[52:16] ever clear and welcome
[52:19] let's go back again every tree in eden
[52:22] was water
[52:24] and water including the tree of
[52:27] good of the knowledge of good and evil
[52:30] we clear now so let's go back on
[52:32] ourselves
[52:34] hallelujah amen every tree that is
[52:38] pleasant
[52:39] to the eyes and good for food the tree
[52:42] of
[52:42] life also pleasant to the eyes good for
[52:46] food
[52:47] in the midst of the garden and the tree
[52:49] of the knowledge of good and evil
[52:51] which we also saw that that tree was
[52:54] good for food and water
[52:56] pleasant to the eye everybody cleared so
[52:58] far job to verse 16
[53:02] and the lord god commanded this is the
[53:06] first commandment
[53:08] that was given by god number one
[53:11] right here we have a commandment
[53:14] that is given by god the first one
[53:19] given to man what is god
[53:22] speaking and the lord god commanded the
[53:25] man
[53:27] saying of every tree
[53:30] of the garden you may do what
[53:34] in other words when you enter the garden
[53:36] whatever you found there eat it
[53:39] amen no question there is no poison
[53:42] there
[53:42] anybody clear part of the tree
[53:46] of the knowledge of good and water
[53:50] even though that tree is pleasant to the
[53:53] eye and good for food
[53:56] that's the only tree i don't want you to
[53:59] touch
[54:02] it anybody clear oh i wish i can
[54:06] grab into ezekiel hallelujah amen
[54:11] part of the tree of the knowledge of
[54:13] good and evil
[54:14] you shall not do water eat of it
[54:18] for in the day that you eat thereof you
[54:22] shall surely water
[54:24] so that tree of the knowledge of good
[54:27] and evil
[54:28] is connected to death so there
[54:31] is the tree of life connected to life
[54:34] and the tree of the knowledge of good
[54:36] and evil connected to what
[54:39] death everybody clear but god's original
[54:42] spoken word
[54:46] everybody clear god word god
[54:49] commandment in the garden of eden
[54:52] was do not touch the tree that is
[54:55] connected to
[54:57] death that is the gospel
[55:00] given to adam one one gospel

[55:12] you want
[55:13] the only commandment to remain alive in
[55:16] eden
[55:17] do not touch on one tweet
[55:21] just one tree
[55:24] that's one tree that was the message of
[55:27] the hour
[55:28] that's it as long as adam keep
[55:31] one commandment nothing can happen to
[55:35] him
[55:36] adam didn't have to keep genesis
[55:39] leviticus
[55:40] numbers and and corinthians second
[55:43] corinthians no
[55:44] only one that
[55:48] everybody clear and the lord god verse
[55:52] 18
[55:52] said it is not good that man should be
[55:55] alone
[55:56] i will make him here help meet for him
[56:00] in other words he is loved he's he's not
[56:03] having a companion
[56:05] verse 19 and out of the ground
[56:08] it looks like god is creating the second
[56:10] time
[56:11] because in in uh in uh chapter two at
[56:15] the beginning the bible
[56:16] say god rested but it looks like god is
[56:18] creating
[56:19] it is not that god is creating again
[56:21] here he's working in
[56:23] eden in the garden anybody clear
[56:27] and adam out of the ground god
[56:30] the lord god formed every beast of the
[56:32] field
[56:33] and every file of the air and brought
[56:35] them to adam
[56:36] to see what would uh what
[56:39] what he would call them and whatsoever
[56:42] adam called every living creature
[56:44] that was the name thereof and adam gave
[56:48] name to our caddo
[56:50] and to the fall of the earth and to
[56:52] every beast of the water
[56:54] of the field but for adam there was not
[56:57] found a help meet for him
[57:00] now the creation of the woman
[57:03] and the lord god caused a deep sleep
[57:06] because he needed a deep anesthesia
[57:09] they got to perform a surgery he can't
[57:12] feel the pain
[57:13] he caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam
[57:17] and he slept and he took one of his ribs
[57:21] who's doing this work
[57:23] do you see the devil here
[57:29] what were we preaching in the message
[57:30] before
[57:32] amen and close up the flesh instead

[1:00:46] and water
[1:00:47] and the devil the first attack that he
[1:00:51] comes

[1:00:56] word of god

[1:02:13] serpent say
[1:02:15] to the woman you shall not surely water
[1:02:19] the second attack of the devil
[1:02:22] is to prove you that the spoken word of
[1:02:25] god
[1:02:27] is alive
[1:02:32] number one the devil bring
[1:02:35] question against the spoken word of god
[1:02:41] number two he's gonna show you that what
[1:02:44] the spoken word of god
[1:02:46] gave you is not really the truth
[1:02:52] and the reason he does this is to get
[1:02:55] you out of the box
[1:03:02] once he fulfilled the first one
[1:03:05] bring question in the message of the
[1:03:07] hour

[1:03:12] it's not what he was said
[1:03:14] the third attack he's going to bring you
[1:03:18] his gospel now
[1:03:21] these two are a way to open the door
[1:03:29] it's written in your scripture verse
[1:03:32] five
[1:03:33] and god does know now he's preaching
[1:03:37] in other words when he started he said

[1:04:27] that's gonna make you see eve in a
[1:04:30] different
[1:04:30] light

[1:04:39] that the tree was good for food and that
[1:04:42] he was pleasant to the eyes
[1:04:44] a tree to be water and the beginning eve
[1:04:48] could pass that tree and never desire
[1:04:51] them

[1:05:38] with her and he did what who gave
[1:05:42] adam the tree
[1:05:45] who gave the woman the tree so the
[1:05:48] serpent could not come straight to adam
[1:05:52] and hand to him his gospel the gospel
[1:05:56] of the serpent have to use the woman
[1:06:02] channel
[1:06:05] the woman channel
[1:06:09] sister hallelujah
[1:06:12] job to verse 17. and
[1:06:16] adam and to adam this is god bringing
[1:06:18] judgment
[1:06:19] if you watch god started from the
[1:06:21] serpent from the bottom first from the
[1:06:23] root
[1:06:24] then he moved to eve then to adam
[1:06:28] in other words from the origin then to
[1:06:30] the one he was handed to
[1:06:32] then to the other one now to adam
[1:06:35] what's going on and to adam ever
[1:06:38] here he said who's saying
[1:06:43] i want you to listen to this very
[1:06:44] carefully
[1:06:46] and to adam god said
[1:06:50] because you have hearken to water
[1:06:57] let me start again because you have
[1:07:00] hearkened to utter
[1:07:03] the voice of your wife who was the wife
[1:07:05] of adam
[1:07:07] so eve had a voice
[1:07:15] eve had a voice
[1:07:18] the voice of eve amen
[1:07:23] and that voice of evil is
[1:07:26] not the original voice
[1:07:29] of eve
[1:07:32] everybody following me it is the voice
[1:07:36] of the devil giving to the serpent and
[1:07:42] that voice
[1:07:43] immorphed into eve in other words
[1:07:47] eve had a voice or eve had the gospel
[1:07:53] the voice of designer
[1:07:58] everybody clear because adam
[1:08:01] you were hurting to the voice of
[1:08:04] eve he was eve
[1:08:08] that removed the veil from adam
[1:08:12] the devil never took the veil off of
[1:08:15] adam
[1:08:16] the devil removed the veil from eve
[1:08:20] and then finished his job and he ran
[1:08:23] away
[1:08:24] and he sat down then eve took
[1:08:27] the teaching of satan and goes to adam
[1:08:32] and begin to remove the there from adam
[1:08:35] that's why god is saying that because
[1:08:38] adam you have listened to the gospel of
[1:08:41] eve
[1:08:47] because you have hearken to the voice of
[1:08:50] your wife
[1:08:51] and have eaten off the tree the voice of
[1:08:54] eve
[1:08:55] presented to adam the tree of which
[1:08:59] i commanded you it was eve that brought
[1:09:02] the gospel contrary to the spoken
[1:09:06] word to adam make sense now amen
[1:09:10] saying you shall not eat curses the
[1:09:14] ground
[1:09:14] for your sake in sorrow shall you eat of
[1:09:18] it
[1:09:18] all the days of europe in
[1:09:21] eden two trees the devil
[1:09:25] attacked the spoken word by bringing
[1:09:28] question
[1:09:29] number two deny the spoken word and
[1:09:32] number three
[1:09:32] bring his gospel and deliver it once he
[1:09:35] delivered
[1:09:36] that gospel become the gospel of eve
[1:09:40] now eve had a voice
[1:09:45] let's go to genesis 15.

[1:10:06] of stuff the same way we go into the
[1:10:08] root
[1:10:09] so you get it from there and the whole

[1:28:40] notwithstanding
[1:28:42] i have a few things against you
[1:28:45] everybody clear
[1:28:46] because you permit
[1:28:49] you have a loud
[1:28:54] the voice that woman who
[1:28:58] which got herself a what
[1:29:01] a teacher to do what
[1:29:05] and to what my servant to commit
[1:29:08] fornication
[1:29:10] and to each think sacrifice to adam
[1:29:13] there is a voice of jezebel
[1:29:20] the voice of jezebel
[1:29:23] and jezebel has a gospel and she's also
[1:29:27] teaching just like agar was taught
[1:29:31] just like adam was taught by a woman
[1:29:36] everybody go to revelation 3 verse 17.
[1:29:41] that church of laodicea there is another
[1:29:45] church
[1:29:46] which is called laodicea which is a
[1:29:49] woman
[1:29:50] because a church is a woman
[1:29:54] hallelujah if you read the churches
[1:29:58] the church of ephesus never said
[1:30:01] something
[1:30:04] ephesus was only spoken by god and
[1:30:07] rebuked by god
[1:30:08] the church of smyrna never spoke
[1:30:12] the church of pergamos never spoke
[1:30:16] in the church of that tyrion jezebel
[1:30:19] spoke in the midst of the church
[1:30:22] in the church of saudis nobody spoke
[1:30:25] it was god talking in the church of
[1:30:27] philadelphia
[1:30:28] nobody spoke but let's see the church of
[1:30:32] laodicea
[1:30:34] if the church is talking verse 17.
[1:30:38] you there because you what
[1:30:42] who's saying laodicea has a voice
[1:30:50] the voice of evil the voice of sarah
[1:30:54] the voice of jezebel the voice of loud
[1:30:58] this year
[1:31:00] because you say i am right
[1:31:04] yeah this year has a gospel of
[1:31:06] prosperity
[1:31:11] that's why your charismatic preachers
[1:31:15] your pentecostal preachers always
[1:31:18] measure in prosperity
[1:31:21] [Music]
[1:31:22] that is their gospel
[1:31:27] because you say i am water
[1:31:31] and increase with goods and have
[1:31:34] need of water it is a voice of
[1:31:38] indifference
[1:31:41] amen a voice that doesn't want rebuke
[1:31:46] a voice that doesn't want you to touch
[1:31:47] my life
[1:31:49] a voice that i know everything you can
[1:31:51] tell me
[1:31:52] i have to live my own life i have to
[1:31:55] take my own decision
[1:31:56] i don't need anything
[1:32:01] and no not an ignorant voice
[1:32:05] no not that you are water
[1:32:09] and water and what
[1:32:12] and what and what
[1:32:15] a voice that would let you go naked
[1:32:19] without you realizing you are naked it's
[1:32:26] a voice
[1:32:26] that removes respect on anger
[1:32:30] that abraham can remove his clothes and
[1:32:32] anger is comfortable
[1:32:34] amen everybody clear
[1:32:39] blessed be the name of the lord we on
[1:32:41] part 39
[1:32:43] hallelujah we talk about this woman
[1:32:46] babylon
[1:32:48] jezebel and in proverbs 7
[1:32:51] we saw that there was a harlot that
[1:32:54] attacked the young man
[1:32:56] and the young man was naive void of
[1:33:00] understanding
[1:33:01] and he met a woman that dressed like a
[1:33:04] harlot and we know jezebel is a harlot
[1:33:06] she's even the mother of harlot and then
[1:33:10] when the man that boy met the woman
[1:33:13] the bible says that the woman had a
[1:33:16] subtle heart
[1:33:19] brother branham says this in the serpent
[1:33:21] seal
[1:33:22] he said the serpent is the missing
[1:33:25] person
[1:33:26] between the chimpanzee and the men
[1:33:29] of course listen notice this that the
[1:33:32] serpent
[1:33:33] was not a reptile that was the curse
[1:33:36] that made him her a reptile he was
[1:33:39] most subtle of
[1:33:42] all the beasts of the field
[1:33:45] now i went and got dictionary today
[1:33:49] from everywhere to look up this word
[1:33:52] what the word of subtle mean
[1:33:55] it means to be water and to be wet
[1:34:01] so the serpent was very intelligent
[1:34:05] and that intelligence was mixed
[1:34:08] with craftiness it is an
[1:34:12] intelligence that can deceive you
[1:34:15] it is an intelligence that can it is a
[1:34:19] hypocritical
[1:34:20] intelligence it is an intelligence
[1:34:24] that can take you in the ways you won't
[1:34:26] realize
[1:34:27] until you are taken advantage of
[1:34:32] everybody clear there were many beasts
[1:34:35] in the garden of eden
[1:34:36] why did the devil choose this one
[1:34:40] because there was something in this
[1:34:42] beast
[1:34:43] that matches the devil everybody clear
[1:34:48] watch your character watch your behavior
[1:34:52] because your behavior can pull a spirit
[1:34:55] on you
[1:34:57] hallelujah it means to be smart
[1:35:01] to be crafty and the best interpretation
[1:35:06] of the hebrew
[1:35:07] from maha meha
[1:35:10] means having a true knowledge of the
[1:35:14] principles of water
[1:35:17] when brother branham spoke about the
[1:35:19] principle of life
[1:35:21] what the meaning really is
[1:35:24] that not only was the serpent smart
[1:35:29] not only was the serpent saddle
[1:35:32] but the serpent knew the principles
[1:35:37] of life in other words the serpent
[1:35:40] knew biology very well
[1:35:49] those who went to college if you look at
[1:35:52] your biology book
[1:35:54] you will see the right the principle of
[1:35:57] biology
[1:35:58] everybody clear bio means life
[1:36:04] are you following me bio means
[1:36:08] life logic
[1:36:11] means that study are you following me
[1:36:14] biology is the study
[1:36:17] of life in
[1:36:20] biology they taught you anonymity
[1:36:24] in biology they taught you how is
[1:36:27] your your skeleton how is your secretary
[1:36:30] system
[1:36:31] how is your respiratory system the devil
[1:36:34] the devil this serpent had every single
[1:36:39] knowledge of
[1:36:39] that are you following me
[1:36:43] and in the book of revelation the bible
[1:36:47] said
[1:36:47] the old devil the old serpent who is
[1:36:50] called there the devil
[1:36:53] not that the serpent was the devil
[1:36:56] but the devil incarnated
[1:37:00] into the serpent are you there
[1:37:03] and took opportunity of the knowledge
[1:37:07] that was in this beast the day for the
[1:37:11] serpent
[1:37:12] knew everything about a woman
[1:37:15] that is did not know because god
[1:37:19] blocked eve from the tree of knowledge
[1:37:22] of good and evil
[1:37:24] ever here the serpent knew things about
[1:37:28] adam that adam himself
[1:37:31] did not know about his own body
[1:37:35] the serpent was a phd
[1:37:40] in biology if you are
[1:37:43] blank if you don't know anything
[1:37:48] the devil can teach you
[1:37:51] everybody clear so far hallelujah
[1:37:55] brother branham says the pentecostal
[1:38:00] in this modern age that the bible
[1:38:02] predicted
[1:38:03] will be will be like the laodicea
[1:38:08] laodicea what about them explain this
[1:38:11] he says there is a greek teacher sitting
[1:38:14] here
[1:38:15] listening at me de la hodisha means
[1:38:24] a woman
[1:38:28] is the names is a woman's name
[1:38:32] in greek none of the rest of the church
[1:38:36] is represented by the name but now
[1:38:39] it is a water a welcome
[1:38:43] so brother branham explained to us that
[1:38:46] that voice that begin to speak in the
[1:38:49] tartarian edge
[1:38:51] is the same voice that is taking over
[1:38:55] in this age
[1:38:58] everybody clear so far that's right
[1:39:01] and we got rich we got need of nothing
[1:39:04] but don't know that we are naked blind
[1:39:07] and miserable
[1:39:08] walk out of the way what have we done we
[1:39:12] pick up some treasures maybe
[1:39:14] like judah did then we didn't work with
[1:39:17] it no more
[1:39:18] sold out for personal gain so many
[1:39:21] people do that
[1:39:22] so many denominations compromised upon
[1:39:25] the world
[1:39:26] in order to get more water and personal
[1:39:30] water
[1:39:31] they're worrying more about their
[1:39:32] finances than
[1:39:34] anything not knowing that they're
[1:39:36] preaching the very gospel
[1:39:38] of jezebel everybody clear so far
[1:39:41] in revelation 17 the bible says that
[1:39:45] there is a couple
[1:39:47] in the hand of the prostitute and that
[1:39:50] cup brother branham translated that
[1:39:53] it is the doctrine of the church
[1:39:57] brother branham what she have had
[1:40:02] in her hand her what
[1:40:05] what she's holding out to the people we
[1:40:08] are the church we are this and she's
[1:40:11] made the
[1:40:12] kings of the earth become drunk with her
[1:40:15] like that we are this we are the great
[1:40:18] power
[1:40:19] we sweep every nation we are the
[1:40:21] greatest church there is
[1:40:23] come on drink your flower pour out a
[1:40:26] little bit of it
[1:40:27] you take it you take it there it is and
[1:40:30] she had
[1:40:30] in her hand a cup in other words the cup
[1:40:34] that is in the hand of this woman
[1:40:36] is the doctrine by doctrine it is the
[1:40:40] very teaching
[1:40:44] doctrine means the teaching
[1:40:50] everything okay okay praise god
[1:40:54] can't you see that people that will
[1:40:57] adopt
[1:40:58] anything contrary to this word is the
[1:41:01] same
[1:41:03] didn't outfit bible in revelation 17
[1:41:05] called the catholic church a whole
[1:41:08] a prostitute didn't he call the
[1:41:11] protestant
[1:41:12] the mother she was the mother of harlot
[1:41:16] the same thing she give out doctrine
[1:41:19] from her cup of water amen
[1:41:23] the teaching of babylon is filthy
[1:41:28] it is a teaching that breaks the field
[1:41:32] it is a teaching that removes respect
[1:41:36] it is a teaching that caused sarah
[1:41:40] to make abraham love a god amen
[1:41:45] hallelujah
[1:41:48] help us lord she give her
[1:41:51] doctrine from her cup of filthiness
[1:41:54] of the abomination of her fornication
[1:41:58] death and filth to make up
[1:42:02] of male men instead of the word of the
[1:42:05] living god
[1:42:06] which is true and water so this
[1:42:10] doctrine is the teaching of fornication
[1:42:15] everybody following me hallelujah
[1:42:19] why are you pondering on this woman
[1:42:23] everybody clear
[1:42:27] main door that
[1:42:30] the devil used
[1:42:34] to destroy and to propagate
[1:42:38] his seed has always been a woman
[1:42:45] let me start it again the reason why we
[1:42:49] are dealing with women
[1:42:52] there's reason why jezebel is a woman
[1:42:55] because from the garden of eden
[1:42:59] the woman is the weaker vessels
[1:43:02] because she was the product of the
[1:43:05] product
[1:43:06] and the devil knowing that
[1:43:10] having the true understanding of the
[1:43:13] principle of life
[1:43:15] when the devil want to destroy something
[1:43:19] when the devil want to bring his gospel
[1:43:23] and introduce his gospel the devil
[1:43:26] always uses a woman
[1:43:31] everybody following me i put back the
[1:43:34] men in their place
[1:43:36] i put back the sister in their place but
[1:43:39] we are dealing with an immoral woman
[1:43:42] anybody clear so far the man dawg
[1:43:46] ever used by the devil to destroy
[1:43:49] and to propagate his seed is through a
[1:43:52] woman
[1:43:54] anybody clear in the case of adam
[1:43:58] the devil used eve and adam
[1:44:02] listened to the voice of evil and
[1:44:05] brought trouble
[1:44:06] relax sister we'll be okay
[1:44:10] in the time of noah the bible says that
[1:44:13] the daughter of
[1:44:14] men became beautiful and they
[1:44:18] opened the door for god to bring
[1:44:20] judgment
[1:44:21] because violence was upon the earth
[1:44:25] everybody following me for abraham
[1:44:29] it took the voice of sarah to present
[1:44:32] them to abraham
[1:44:34] edgar and bring another gospel
[1:44:39] everybody following me in the time of
[1:44:42] joseph he took the wise from purify
[1:44:47] to bring a different gospel unto joseph
[1:44:53] is everybody awake hallelujah
[1:44:56] in the time of soul
[1:45:00] when soul was toward the end of his life
[1:45:05] son went to the witch
[1:45:08] of indo not the wizard
[1:45:11] the seed of sorcery was kept
[1:45:15] by a woman in handle
[1:45:18] the witch offender because so
[1:45:22] destroy all the witches in the land
[1:45:26] but that seed was protected by a woman
[1:45:30] everybody created so far in the time of
[1:45:33] david the devil uses worshipper
[1:45:38] to destroy david i better clear
[1:45:42] in the time of solomon the devil uses
[1:45:46] strange women
[1:45:48] to destroy the wisest man upon the press
[1:45:51] of the earth
[1:45:54] that's why when israel was going to the
[1:45:57] promised land
[1:45:58] god says this lest them make a covenant
[1:46:03] with the inhabitant of the land and they
[1:46:06] go
[1:46:07] a warring after their god and do
[1:46:09] sacrifice unto their god
[1:46:11] and one do what they invite you
[1:46:15] amen and die eat off the water
[1:46:19] so when you make covenant with people
[1:46:22] when you make friendship with people you
[1:46:25] are putting
[1:46:26] yourself in trouble if the people
[1:46:29] that are your friend don't believe like
[1:46:32] you
[1:46:33] because one of this day when they're
[1:46:36] gonna go to their sacrifice
[1:46:38] they will bring you an invitation you
[1:46:40] want to invite them to come to your
[1:46:42] church
[1:46:43] one day they will invite you and by
[1:46:45] constraint
[1:46:47] you're going to go visit them that's
[1:46:49] where they're going to get you
[1:46:52] that's why i preach on our friendship
[1:46:54] separate
[1:46:58] because when they invite you you never
[1:47:00] know what they therefore have for you
[1:47:02] everybody care and that damn make
[1:47:06] that take off the water until the sun
[1:47:10] and the daughter go away
[1:47:14] god is saying that when you begin to
[1:47:17] have friendship
[1:47:19] you will get comfortable you begin to
[1:47:22] invite one another
[1:47:24] and before you know it your son
[1:47:28] begin to last after a woman
[1:47:31] that is not of your church
[1:47:35] yes are you there you brought
[1:47:38] friend that don't believe the message
[1:47:41] you have a lot of friends that don't
[1:47:44] agree with the message
[1:47:46] you have friends that can speak on
[1:47:48] brother branham by
[1:47:50] going to visit one another all the time
[1:47:54] you are giving a message to your
[1:47:57] children
[1:47:58] that we are family are you there
[1:48:03] you are opening a door and your
[1:48:06] children will begin to get comfortable
[1:48:09] with the women of another religion
[1:48:13] jesus everybody following me
[1:48:17] their daughter unto the son
[1:48:20] why god is insisting not to give the
[1:48:23] daughter
[1:48:24] to the son the bible says and their
[1:48:27] daughter got a water
[1:48:30] a whoring after that and make
[1:48:33] that sun go away after that
[1:48:37] your son will not go directly
[1:48:41] to another it is the woman
[1:48:44] that's going to take your son to the
[1:48:48] idol because the devil uses that door
[1:48:52] to bring his seed or to destroy
[1:48:55] everybody close
[1:48:57] turn detroit uh deuteronomy 7 and when
[1:49:01] the lord that god
[1:49:03] if they will create a possibility you
[1:49:05] need to minimize your moving around
[1:49:08] it's disturbing the spirit
[1:49:12] if it's necessary you can go but stop
[1:49:14] moving around
[1:49:15] if it's unnecessary it's disturbing the
[1:49:17] spirit
[1:49:18] and when the lord that god shall deliver
[1:49:21] them before them
[1:49:22] that shall smite them and utterly
[1:49:25] destroy them
[1:49:26] and that shall make no covenant with
[1:49:28] them
[1:49:29] nor show mercy unto them why
[1:49:33] neither shall they make what
[1:49:36] marriages with them that daughter
[1:49:39] shall not give unto us his son know
[1:49:43] his daughter shall you take
[1:49:46] unto your son why for them we want
[1:49:50] who from following water
[1:49:54] because the devil always uses that door
[1:49:59] everybody cares so far amen
[1:50:02] in deuteronomy 17 that shall in
[1:50:06] any ways set him king over thee whom the
[1:50:09] lord that god shall choose
[1:50:11] among your brethren shall that set king
[1:50:14] over him
[1:50:15] that shall not set a stranger over thee
[1:50:18] which is not the brother neither shall
[1:50:21] he multiply what
[1:50:24] even the king of israel cannot multiply
[1:50:28] women like solomon why
[1:50:32] because that his heart turned not what
[1:50:37] it is the door used by the devil
[1:50:40] anybody clear let's go to second king
[1:50:43] chapter eight
[1:50:45] hallelujah
[1:50:49] we're talking about an immoral woman
[1:50:52] not your sister
[1:50:56] amen the
[1:50:59] second king chapter eight if you dare
[1:51:01] you can say amen
[1:51:02] the voice of eve
[1:51:06] hallelujah the voice of sarah
[1:51:10] the voice of jezebel which is the voice
[1:51:13] of laodicea
[1:51:15] why it is the door we know that
[1:51:18] israel split in two
[1:51:23] ten tribes went on the other side
[1:51:26] and the ten tribe made what they called
[1:51:28] the kingdom of israel
[1:51:30] he was made of ten tribes that's why
[1:51:33] jeroboam
[1:51:34] and ahab was there anybody here
[1:51:38] then the other two tribe the tribe of
[1:51:40] benjamin
[1:51:41] and the tribe of judah already explained
[1:51:43] it here remember on the number
[1:51:44] right it stays in the kingdom
[1:51:48] called the kingdom of judah everybody
[1:51:51] clear so far
[1:51:52] and we found out that the the number 10
[1:51:55] was a carnal number amen and he was
[1:51:59] first in the kingdom of israel
[1:52:02] that jezebel entered when jezebel
[1:52:06] entered jezebel polluted the entire
[1:52:09] kingdom
[1:52:10] and destroyed all the seeds of god until
[1:52:13] elijah said
[1:52:14] father they have destroyed everybody i'm
[1:52:17] the only one remaining
[1:52:18] god said no there is still seven
[1:52:20] thousand ever clear
[1:52:22] but jezebel destroyed the prophet of god
[1:52:25] now the kingdom of judah was still
[1:52:27] spared
[1:52:29] because the kingdom of judah was right
[1:52:31] with god
[1:52:32] there was no entrance of jezebel into
[1:52:34] the kingdom of judah
[1:52:36] watch how the devil entered the kingdom
[1:52:38] of judah
[1:52:39] everybody cleared so far remember adam
[1:52:43] he took eve remember
[1:52:47] abraham he took sarah david
[1:52:51] he took bathsheba solomon he took
[1:52:54] women joseph they took the house of
[1:52:56] potiphar ever cleared
[1:52:59] for ahab they took jezebel insult
[1:53:02] jezebel and that said the whole kingdom
[1:53:04] is destroyed
[1:53:05] and judah won't steal and the protection
[1:53:07] and all they leave at
[1:53:09] if you study you will see all delivered
[1:53:11] move out
[1:53:12] and went to judah and brought protection
[1:53:15] now how
[1:53:16] is that seed getting into judah
[1:53:19] second king chapter eight if you dare
[1:53:21] you can say amen
[1:53:23] verse 16. everybody clear
[1:53:29] second king chapter 8 verse 16. the
[1:53:32] bible says this
[1:53:33] hallelujah and
[1:53:37] in the fifth year of jeremiah ever clear
[1:53:41] the son of who we're talking about the
[1:53:44] kingdom of israel
[1:53:46] ahab is in israel everybody clear
[1:53:51] ahab of israel kama
[1:53:55] jehoshaphat in the judah remember
[1:53:58] jehoshaphat always kept
[1:54:03] friendship with ahab
[1:54:07] do you follow me and their friendship
[1:54:11] got the children comfortable
[1:54:17] let me repeat it again because i keep
[1:54:19] saying about friendship
[1:54:20] you don't get it jesus affair
[1:54:24] was a good man that followed god
[1:54:27] ahab was already rejected by god
[1:54:30] was under the judgment of god and i
[1:54:33] proved to you here in this church
[1:54:35] that when jehoshaphat went to war he was
[1:54:38] almost killed
[1:54:39] when he came back god rebuked him from
[1:54:42] being closer
[1:54:44] to ahab he went again and began to do
[1:54:47] business with who the house of arab
[1:54:51] and god destroyed the business because
[1:54:54] he didn't listen
[1:54:55] the third time when they invited him he
[1:54:57] said no i'm not gonna do it
[1:54:59] but that relationship of jehoshaphat
[1:55:03] going visit ahab going visit aham
[1:55:06] taking his family to ahab the children
[1:55:10] got comfortable jehoshaphat saw the
[1:55:13] idolatry
[1:55:14] of israel and god was against that
[1:55:17] kingdom
[1:55:18] but he still want to keep fellowship
[1:55:21] they are believing their god
[1:55:22] they are doing their own thing but we
[1:55:24] still friend we still can eat together
[1:55:27] we still can fellowship together amen
[1:55:30] why jezebel is spitting upon elijah
[1:55:35] are you there israel was against the
[1:55:38] gospel of elijah
[1:55:41] and the other kingdom judah loved elijah
[1:55:45] but their relationship was kept
[1:55:48] we are still friends watch that
[1:55:51] friendship
[1:55:52] what he did you okay now
[1:55:56] let's go to verse 16. and in the fifth
[1:55:59] year of
[1:56:00] joram the king the son of ahab
[1:56:04] king of israel jehoshaphat being the
[1:56:07] king of judah
[1:56:09] jehoram the son of who
[1:56:12] jehoshaphat king of what begin to do
[1:56:16] what
[1:56:16] in other words jehoshaphat is dead his
[1:56:19] son
[1:56:20] reigned but remember that son used to go
[1:56:23] to the house of ahab
[1:56:26] you follow me watch what the parents
[1:56:28] produce
[1:56:30] parent delinquency are you there
[1:56:34] verse 17 30 and two years old
[1:56:37] was he when he began to reign and he ran
[1:56:40] eight years in jerusalem and he
[1:56:43] walked in the way of the kings of water
[1:56:47] how can a man that was raised in the
[1:56:50] kingdom of judah
[1:56:51] begin to act like the kingdom of israel
[1:56:55] his father was a just man a very good
[1:56:58] man
[1:56:59] god even protected him when he made an
[1:57:02] error
[1:57:03] but when his own son took over the
[1:57:05] throne
[1:57:06] he began to behave like the other
[1:57:08] kingdom
[1:57:09] what made his son to behave or to copy
[1:57:14] the bad kingdom you ready
[1:57:18] watch your scripture verse 18
[1:57:22] and he worked in the way of the king of
[1:57:25] israel
[1:57:26] as did the house of who do you see
[1:57:29] your companion your friendship what he
[1:57:32] caused
[1:57:33] you thought you were visiting one
[1:57:35] another
[1:57:36] you thought you know the message you
[1:57:38] thought you can protect yourself
[1:57:41] you didn't see the vulnerability of your
[1:57:44] children
[1:57:45] in those environment that's why
[1:57:48] spoken word separated
[1:57:55] let me go and he does
[1:57:58] did the house of ahab watch verse 18
[1:58:02] for the who the daughter of who
[1:58:06] the daughter of ahab was white
[1:58:13] the daughter of ahab was the daughter of
[1:58:18] jezebel
[1:58:22] so when jehoshaphat kept his
[1:58:24] relationship
[1:58:25] to keep his friendship he didn't see
[1:58:29] jezebel begin to look he called his
[1:58:31] daughter
[1:58:32] he said when you see the sons of
[1:58:35] jehoshaphat get here
[1:58:37] you need to make sure you clean okay
[1:58:40] okay
[1:58:40] remember what she did to jehu when she
[1:58:43] who was coming
[1:58:44] she painted her face and fixed yourself
[1:58:47] so
[1:58:48] when jehoshaphat was making a phone call
[1:58:51] hey this saturday we coming to visit you
[1:58:54] because it's memorial day
[1:58:56] jezebel called and say you know what
[1:58:59] make sure
[1:59:00] you put all your makeup you can get
[1:59:02] married you see
[1:59:03] are you are in a royal king i don't want
[1:59:05] you to marry peasant
[1:59:07] i want you to be married between the
[1:59:08] king and the king and the kingship
[1:59:10] okay so the daughter of jezebel were
[1:59:13] preparing
[1:59:14] making their makeup just like their
[1:59:16] mother and they were there
[1:59:17] then jehoshaphat came god bless you
[1:59:20] brother god bless you god bless you how
[1:59:21] are you doing no no we're not going to
[1:59:22] talk about your religion
[1:59:24] we know you rejected the message wake up
[1:59:25] the message so let's talk about business
[1:59:27] and the other stuff
[1:59:28] and then when the kids get together
[1:59:31] let's go to our bedroom
[1:59:32] and then they went to the bedroom amen
[1:59:34] then the daughter
[1:59:36] of jezebel begin to come and tend them
[1:59:39] and twist themselves jerorah was there
[1:59:43] he said i don't know over there it's
[1:59:46] just
[1:59:48] don't marry this don't do this this this
[1:59:51] woman is beautiful matter of fact from
[1:59:53] the beginning we used to be all israel
[1:59:55] now it's just the spirit that happened
[1:59:57] what is wrong
[2:00:03] the parent caused that and he ended up
[2:00:06] that
[2:00:07] the child of a righteous man married
[2:00:10] a daughter of a bad woman that god fed
[2:00:13] to the dog
[2:00:15] watch now what is that one woman doing
[2:00:19] to the whole kingdom of judah
[2:00:21] because the door that the devil uses is
[2:00:24] always
[2:00:25] uh
[2:00:29] let's go to verse 18 and he walk in the
[2:00:31] way
[2:00:32] of the king of israel as did the house
[2:00:36] of ahab
[2:00:37] for the daughter of ahab that's the king
[2:00:40] was his wife and he did evil in the
[2:00:43] sight of the lord
[2:00:44] yet the lord would not destroy judah
[2:00:48] for david his servant's sake as he
[2:00:50] promised him
[2:00:51] to give him always a light everybody
[2:00:54] there
[2:00:54] and to his children in his day
[2:00:58] what happened edom do you know who edom
[2:01:01] is
[2:01:03] esau but i'm saying he saw his
[2:01:07] you follow me in his day is so
[2:01:11] revolted the kingdom of judah
[2:01:14] already mastered the great prostitute
[2:01:18] they already mastered rome they already
[2:01:22] got protection against rome
[2:01:24] but a seed of jezebel entered there
[2:01:27] and unleashed and and released
[2:01:31] that spirit off
[2:01:34] the catholicism that was fought
[2:01:38] in the kingdom of judah was released
[2:01:41] that beast
[2:01:42] that was wounded got healed
[2:01:48] why through a woman they just took a
[2:01:52] package of
[2:01:53] a woman and send that to judah and
[2:01:56] that's it
[2:01:57] and the seed that was in israel entered
[2:02:00] judah
[2:02:00] now jezebel polluted the entire israel
[2:02:05] everybody clear in his day edom revolted
[2:02:09] from under the hand of the of judah
[2:02:11] and made a king over themselves so
[2:02:14] jerome
[2:02:15] jerome went over to zaire and all the
[2:02:18] chariot with him
[2:02:19] and he rose by night and smote the idol
[2:02:22] man
[2:02:22] which compassed him about he tried to
[2:02:25] control it
[2:02:26] and the captain of the chariot and the
[2:02:28] people fled
[2:02:29] into their tent yet despite every effort
[2:02:32] he tried to do
[2:02:34] yet edom revolted from under the hand of
[2:02:37] judah
[2:02:38] to this day then libna revolted the same
[2:02:42] everybody clear so far job to verse 27.
[2:02:48] everybody clear verse 26
[2:02:51] two and 22 years and 20 years old
[2:02:54] was ahazya when he begin to reign and he
[2:02:57] ran
[2:02:58] one year in jerusalem remember the seed
[2:03:00] is already destroyed
[2:03:02] and his mother name was who italia
[2:03:06] the daughter of who omri
[2:03:09] king of israel and he walked in the way
[2:03:12] of the house of who
[2:03:14] and did evil in the sight of the lord
[2:03:18] as did the house of who why
[2:03:21] for he was the son-in-law to the house
[2:03:24] of who
[2:03:26] the daughter of jezebel begin to get
[2:03:29] married
[2:03:30] one by one to the kings the first king
[2:03:32] come
[2:03:33] the first daughter he dies the next king
[2:03:35] come there was another daughter that was
[2:03:37] already in preparation
[2:03:38] to keep that kingdom everybody clear so
[2:03:40] far
[2:03:41] so the key that we're getting here is
[2:03:43] the mandolin
[2:03:45] used by the devil to destroy and
[2:03:48] propagate his cities through the woman
[2:03:51] brother branham an analyst just from
[2:03:54] chicago
[2:03:56] good a woman wrote an article the police
[2:03:59] force
[2:04:00] that they chased down in the united
[2:04:02] states
[2:04:03] metropolitan united states that 90 watt
[2:04:08] nandi 98 of every crime
[2:04:12] that was ever did in any form
[2:04:16] in the united states there was either a
[2:04:19] water
[2:04:21] in it or a water
[2:04:25] if you don't find the cause to be the
[2:04:28] woman
[2:04:29] you will find behind the scene it was a
[2:04:32] woman
[2:04:33] 98 of crimes
[2:04:38] everybody watch the trouble
[2:04:42] in the churches
[2:04:46] somebody pop it up are you there
[2:04:49] if you see two families fighting
[2:04:54] fighting fighting are you there
[2:04:58] if you see a competition between
[2:05:01] families
[2:05:02] watch very closely who is behind that
[2:05:07] it is not a man it is usually a sister
[2:05:13] now what i'm saying all of this to get
[2:05:16] to one thing here at the end
[2:05:19] so that you can see what's the mother
[2:05:22] she was
[2:05:22] mad to deceive like she did who
[2:05:26] adam at the beginning tell him that the
[2:05:29] fruit was what
[2:05:31] and so forth to deceive him and take him
[2:05:34] away from water
[2:05:36] the devil just deposited everything to
[2:05:39] eve and he left the girl
[2:05:42] and eve took it and began to maneuver it
[2:05:46] that's why man is the one that preaches
[2:05:49] the gospel
[2:05:51] not the woman hallelujah
[2:05:54] to deceive him and take him away from
[2:05:56] the world that is the way the church
[2:05:58] does today
[2:06:00] same thing laodicea everybody clear
[2:06:04] you are my sisters see but look
[2:06:07] there is only one place in the whole
[2:06:09] universe that gives a man his credit
[2:06:12] that is god give it to him today
[2:06:16] the god of america is a woman now that's
[2:06:18] right
[2:06:19] strip one of these little women off and
[2:06:22] said then
[2:06:22] set them down here on the beach
[2:06:24] somewhere with their bathing suits on
[2:06:26] and she shall send more men to hell than
[2:06:30] all the bootleg joint john you got in
[2:06:32] the city
[2:06:33] that's right she's america's girl
[2:06:36] she makes men for anything she wants to
[2:06:39] the devil not that in the what
[2:06:44] i'm getting to your designing of the
[2:06:46] devil
[2:06:48] that is the reason he chose water
[2:06:52] you follow me now he understood that
[2:06:56] now the woman is redeemed and she can be
[2:07:00] a sister and godly
[2:07:02] but brother what we need today is some
[2:07:04] more
[2:07:05] good old-fashioned god sent holy ghost
[2:07:08] born
[2:07:09] mothers to raise children
[2:07:12] right talk about juvenile delinquency
[2:07:16] it is water that's what i just showed
[2:07:19] you the parents were
[2:07:21] visiting and something happened now
[2:07:24] brother stephen
[2:07:25] let's go to song of solomon chapter
[2:07:27] eight
[2:07:28] as we begin to get now
[2:07:33] you get the concept you got the door and
[2:07:36] let's see what's happening
[2:07:37] because of this that's why you seen the
[2:07:41] gospel is usually like it's tight to the
[2:07:45] sister
[2:07:47] it is god trying to protect the woman
[2:07:51] it is not god trying to be mean to a
[2:07:54] woman
[2:07:55] it is god understanding that the devil
[2:07:58] usually use that door that's why god
[2:08:02] brings a strong protection to the woman
[2:08:07] that's why the prophet came and said
[2:08:10] leave
[2:08:10] the sisters at home you brother
[2:08:14] go work because you are exposing that
[2:08:17] woman
[2:08:18] and the devil can attack her when you
[2:08:21] are not there just like she he attacking
[2:08:25] when adam was not around
[2:08:29] song of solomon chapter eight are you
[2:08:32] there
[2:08:33] we have verse eight we have a little
[2:08:36] water
[2:08:38] and she has no water it doesn't means
[2:08:40] that that would that sister doesn't have
[2:08:42] breast
[2:08:44] remember in ezekiel chapter 16 we found
[2:08:47] out that the breast of the woman was
[2:08:49] formed she was under puberty make sense
[2:08:52] amen so what the bible is saying here
[2:08:54] the sister

[2:14:12] of the water
[2:14:14] she need to be born again and the reds
[2:14:17] pick up the blood that made it righteous
[2:14:20] the cross was a curse curse is he that
[2:14:23] hang on a tree
[2:14:24] the cross was a curse until the blood of
[2:14:26] jesus christ poured on
[2:14:27] it then we embrace it in our heart
[2:14:31] for it is righteousness of god it is the
[2:14:34] righteousness of god
[2:14:35] it was the red that is in the cedarwood
[2:14:38] that makes the white water she needs to
[2:14:41] be protected
[2:14:43] by the blood
[2:14:47] it is in your book

[2:15:07] his son
[2:15:08] the lord jesus at our red scarlet scene
[2:15:12] they become white as water because
[2:15:15] she opened the door she need to be
[2:15:18] cleansed by the cross
[2:15:26] bring a protection to her under the
[2:15:29] token
[2:15:30] because her door was open satan will
[2:15:34] temper again because of that weakness
[2:15:38] you remember oliver and ahola the door
[2:15:42] were not closed

[2:17:10] he will be naturally like elijah and who

[2:17:18] what
[2:17:20] and the ways elijah cried out against
[2:17:24] him
[2:17:25] and john rebuke who the spirit of elijah
[2:17:29] comes five times
[2:17:31] the first time elijah rebuked jesus
[2:17:34] the second time elisha
[2:17:38] in second king chapter three and elijah
[2:17:41] said unto the king of israel
[2:17:43] what have had to do with thee get did to

[2:17:51] child
[2:17:51] of jezebel coming to seek a prophet
[2:17:55] and the prophet was again attacking that
[2:17:57] jezebel spirit again
[2:18:00] and elijah said as the lord host liveth
[2:18:04] before human stand surely we are not
[2:18:08] worried not that i regard the presence
[2:18:11] of who

[2:19:39] designed by the devil
[2:19:44] and we were taught that it means that
[2:19:46] the woman
[2:19:47] was created by the devil right
[2:19:51] let's listen to brother branham all
[2:19:53] right
[2:19:55] in the bible job says that
[2:19:58] that hand has made me

[2:21:08] when as yet there were none of them how
[2:21:11] precious
[2:21:12] also are they unto whom
[2:21:16] so the one who created man is god
[2:21:22] the one who created the woman is god
[2:21:28] not to the devil
[2:21:31] brother stephen brother branham said the
[2:21:33] devil

[2:21:55] perfect and it was
[2:21:59] the work of god not the devil
[2:22:06] hallelujah i seen a picture one time i
[2:22:10] believe he was in greece
[2:22:12] of an artist that painted a picture of
[2:22:14] eve
[2:22:15] she was the most horrible looking thing
[2:22:17] you ever seen
[2:22:18] that shows what a carnal mind can look
[2:22:21] in

[2:22:27] woman of water
[2:22:28] [Music]
[2:22:32] relax notice why do
[2:22:36] why did she do such a thing being in the
[2:22:39] water
[2:22:40] not only was she beautiful and perfect
[2:22:43] she was in the same level
[2:22:47] as men

[2:29:43] through virtue loaded on her
[2:29:47] stay with me if i can finish just this
[2:29:49] part
[2:29:51] she has a sacred trust of virtue
[2:29:54] that has been given to her trusted to
[2:29:57] her by who
[2:29:59] it's god that trusted that this belongs
[2:30:01] to the woman
[2:30:04] anybody clear god gave her that virtue
[2:30:08] just as he was in a garden even she can
[2:30:11] say what
[2:30:12] or what she has a right to refuse and to
[2:30:16] say yes
[2:30:18] she has a sacred trust of water
[2:30:22] you saw it today committed to her that
[2:30:25] she must not work
[2:30:27] the woman who them speaking of here is
[2:30:30] her water womanhood
[2:30:33] virginity we all know motherhood we all
[2:30:36] know she must bear
[2:30:37] children this is the key here that's the
[2:30:40] devil uses
[2:30:43] now we're getting towards your heart
[2:30:44] here it is a water
[2:30:48] or a conduct or a water
[2:30:51] a character around water
[2:30:55] so there is something that a woman must
[2:30:59] have
[2:31:00] when men are around
[2:31:05] there is something that a girl had to
[2:31:08] have
[2:31:09] when abraham is around
[2:31:13] she could not behave like sarah
[2:31:18] hallelujah not letting water
[2:31:23] not at all you understand now
[2:31:26] not at all look on this screen
[2:31:31] and see this movie star doing water
[2:31:36] when the movie star are kissing women
[2:31:40] they are breaking womanhood
[2:31:44] because it's behavior it is not here yet
[2:31:48] it is not here yet
[2:31:52] that womanhood include kissing
[2:31:59] hallelujah and doing what
[2:32:03] we already talked to you in this church
[2:32:04] about hugging and
[2:32:06] water slopping around over these women
[2:32:10] a woman does that is a what
[2:32:13] bad character we already explained you
[2:32:15] this
[2:32:16] i'm gonna move down but the sex gland
[2:32:19] are in the lips
[2:32:21] and see all this nonsense of the
[2:32:23] hollywood today
[2:32:24] and all this slopping and loving around
[2:32:26] with women and so far
[2:32:27] in other words the kissing that you see
[2:32:29] the kids the kids the kids on the movie
[2:32:31] it is breaking womanhood
[2:32:34] because it's not the act yet
[2:32:38] clear laughing around women and so forth
[2:32:41] the little girl looking at that no
[2:32:44] wonder our morals are rotted and decay
[2:32:47] and filthy see because it's put before
[2:32:50] the water
[2:32:51] so when the children look at that
[2:32:55] even though your daughter is still
[2:32:57] virgin
[2:32:59] even though your daughter have not
[2:33:01] gotten pregnant yet
[2:33:04] but you are destroying your daughter
[2:33:07] womanhood
[2:33:11] these things need to be taught
[2:33:15] anybody care hallelujah
[2:33:18] no wonder that men act around women
[2:33:22] the way they do is because women
[2:33:25] act around water the way they want
[2:33:28] in other words the women are the one
[2:33:31] provoking the men
[2:33:37] she character herself out her
[2:33:40] with pair of water and water
[2:33:44] and man water on the street doing what

[2:38:10] and say he look good then the devil
[2:38:13] comes

[2:38:56] everything that's set in water
[2:38:58] so the woman was not created by satan
[2:39:02] everybody clear so far brother branham
[2:39:05] said she was designed what does he mean
[2:39:08] everything that satan has got is what
[2:39:12] something that was water
[2:39:17] i'm heading to the airport just let me
[2:39:19] finish this thought
[2:39:20] then the next time we catch up we'll be
[2:39:22] good sin
[2:39:24] itself is only righteousness profession
[2:39:27] now
[2:39:27] there is only and that is who
[2:39:31] satan is not her he is
[2:39:34] only a water of what
[2:39:38] [Music]
[2:39:41] design by perversion
[2:39:45] of the original creation
[2:39:51] everything is always a perfection of
[2:39:54] what is right
[2:39:55] satan can pervert but he cannot
[2:39:58] do you see what we made brother branham
[2:40:00] speak
[2:40:02] things he didn't even say
[2:40:06] see so we found that set and always
[2:40:08] takes a time
[2:40:10] and what is going to do off off of what
[2:40:12] god has water
[2:40:13] the right hand man of almighty god was
[2:40:16] who
[2:40:17] the son of the morning the first god
[2:40:19] granted him almost what
[2:40:21] co-worker with him he was a co-worker
[2:40:24] partly equal with him
[2:40:26] only he could not water god is the only
[2:40:30] water
[2:40:31] but satan took something that god
[2:40:34] and did what into something water
[2:40:42] ever clear hallelujah
[2:40:45] but in the human race
[2:40:49] it is the woman that is pretty
[2:40:52] not the man originally
[2:40:56] it's that way why was he done
[2:40:59] to deceive by her what
[2:41:02] is that design a creation now we clear
[2:41:06] now
[2:41:07] how did he design the woman and i'm
[2:41:10] going to stop here
[2:41:11] and we're going to pick it up her
[2:41:14] designer saturn
[2:41:17] is still water
[2:41:20] if satan is still working on the woman
[2:41:22] today
[2:41:24] so that means he step at the maternity
[2:41:26] when they bring a baby girl he begin to
[2:41:28] work on her
[2:41:33] satan is still working on her too in
[2:41:35] this last day
[2:41:38] the designer is by what
[2:41:44] are we okay now the designer by water
[2:41:49] she's a virgin he worked on her
[2:41:57] he's designing the woman by working
[2:42:00] on a finnish product
[2:42:05] now there is nothing can stoop like her
[2:42:09] she is designed so that she can be
[2:42:12] deceiving and satan is really doing what
[2:42:17] watch the word of brother brother never
[2:42:20] creating him
[2:42:23] working on her today in this last day
[2:42:27] because he is here who start to work on
[2:42:30] water
[2:42:33] on her who start to work on water
[2:42:38] is her adam of all
[2:42:41] let's stop there
[2:42:44] we need to understand brother branham
[2:42:46] way brother branham is asking
[2:42:49] adam or who
[2:42:54] question what kind of work did adam do
[2:42:57] on evil
[2:43:00] nothing right
[2:43:04] what kind of work did god do on evil he
[2:43:06] created eve
[2:43:08] but brother branham is saying between
[2:43:11] adam
[2:43:12] and satan who work on her is that work
[2:43:15] creation or something else

[2:44:02] that's why he used all of those it's the
[2:44:05] chief weapon
[2:44:07] what is working what is designing
[2:44:09] brother branham saying

[2:57:26] lord's willing we will touch on the coat
[2:57:28] now you see
[2:57:29] how was adam teaching him
[2:57:32] and what was the conversation between
[2:57:35] the serpent and eve you're going to see
[2:57:38] what brother branham said
[2:57:40] then you're going to understand but the
[2:57:42] key i want you to keep for next time
[2:57:45] the design that the devil design
[2:57:49] is he designed womanhood
[2:57:53] he changed the behavior the conduct
[2:57:58] the character of eve now when eve walk
[2:58:02] adam look he said what happened to you
[2:58:05] why are you walking like that who taught
[2:58:07] you that kind of walk
[2:58:09] it is the serpent so why are you
[2:58:11] twisting
[2:58:12] the terpene taught me how to twist
[2:58:15] that's why
[2:58:15] hollywood showed women in models hard
[2:58:18] work
[2:58:19] and women want to work like the women
[2:58:21] and the model
[2:58:22] that teaching is from satan to design
[2:58:26] you because you were not born
[2:58:28] like that and when you walk a certain
[2:58:31] way
[2:58:32] it's gonna cause lust
[2:58:34] [Music]
[2:58:38] let's pray heavenly father lord we thank
[2:58:41] you
[2:58:42] for your grace for your love for your
[2:58:44] mercy
[2:58:46] for giving us another opportunity to dig
[2:58:48] into these things
[2:58:50] lord as we have studied lord you brought
[2:58:53] the position of a man back
[2:58:55] in this church you brought the place of
[2:58:57] a woman
[2:58:58] and the respect that should be given to
[2:59:00] her and to the children without abuse
[2:59:02] from a man
[2:59:04] father now you are showing a door that
[2:59:07] our sister
[2:59:08] need to know to be protected because
[2:59:11] father to overcome
[2:59:12] is to recognize the devil by his tactics
[2:59:16] lord we all wear work that were created
[2:59:19] by you
[2:59:20] but the devil is still working on us
[2:59:23] working on the church
[2:59:24] and working in women specifically
[2:59:27] because your prophet told us that the
[2:59:29] condition
[2:59:30] of a woman is showing the condition of
[2:59:32] the church
[2:59:33] father may we realize what we are
[2:59:36] watching on tv
[2:59:37] what we are trying to copy what we are
[2:59:40] trying to portray
[2:59:41] what we are trying to do on our facebook
[2:59:44] unless we find ourselves
[2:59:46] committing adultery by breaking our
[2:59:49] womanhood
[2:59:50] now realizing that we the one that
[2:59:52] initiated the act alone
[2:59:54] father may we be attentive to nothing
[2:59:57] else
[2:59:58] lord but the original voice of the
[3:00:00] spoken word
[3:00:01] because anything that is contrary to
[3:00:04] that original word is a perversion
[3:00:06] father the voice of evil was perverted
[3:00:09] because he was contrary
[3:00:11] to the original word the voice of sarah
[3:00:13] was perverted
[3:00:14] because he was contrary to the original
[3:00:17] word the voice of jezebel and laodicea
[3:00:20] perverted because it's contrary to the
[3:00:22] original world
[3:00:23] the only voice that was correct was the
[3:00:26] one that was brought to gabriel
[3:00:28] through an angel when he gave mary the
[3:00:30] message
[3:00:31] that message was perfectly in line with
[3:00:34] the prophecy of the old testament
[3:00:36] and he had nothing to do with sex lord
[3:00:38] he was the holy spirit
[3:00:40] coming up with our sensation lord father
[3:00:43] may you touch may you bring again more
[3:00:46] revelation
[3:00:47] and unfold your eyes and give faith lord
[3:00:49] father to this church
[3:00:51] protect us as we commit everything unto
[3:00:53] the hand and the rest of the weak lord
