[1:18] you
[2:56] you
[4:17] you
[4:58] um light time way out in there and is
[5:05] still moon
[5:20] you
[5:28] thank you morning it was a spirit and
[5:34] her and the lady was a fine friend of
[5:37] mine but from that night on she
[5:40] deliberately hated me of course you can
[5:43] see why it was well then when her
[5:46] husband came and we knelt in the room to
[5:48] pray then the Holy Spirit came down that
[5:54] was it then he appeared to her husband
[5:57] that night in a dream he came back with
[6:00] a dream he thought of a joke he come to
[6:03] find out it was a very answer to his
[6:05] wife's healing how that the holy spirit
[6:08] did deal on down into Tucson with
[6:12] brother Norman and them and there the
[6:14] Lord begin to work again with great
[6:16] powerful things and revealing things one
[6:20] night what drew me to this conclusion
[6:23] here I was standing with brother would
[6:28] brother saath Minh and we were about 10
[6:32] o'clock at night and I was looking up
[6:33] towards the skies and a great all came
[6:37] over me and I said just look all that
[6:42] great heavenly hosts and I said
[6:48] everything is perfectly in harmony and
[6:51] brother Wood said looking at two little
[6:54] stars so close together that made look
[6:56] like a light I said but you know brother
[6:59] would according to science in that
[7:02] dipper the Little Dipper the Big Dipper
[7:05] those stars don't look over about two
[7:08] inches apart and they're farther away
[7:11] from each other than we are from them
[7:13] and if they start to this earth it would
[7:16] take at thousands of miles an hour it
[7:18] would take hundreds and hundreds of
[7:19] years from the reach the earth and I
[7:22] said in all this great vast system here
[7:27] and yet they tell us that they look two
[7:29] glasses can see a hundred and twenty
[7:32] million years of light time way out in
[7:40] there and there's
[7:41] still moons and stars and yet God made
[7:45] every one of them and he sets in the
[7:50] midst of them and I said somewhere in
[7:53] there I had pointed out to me one time
[7:55] in an observatory the zodiac beginning
[7:59] with the virgin coming over through the
[8:03] cancer age and on down until the last
[8:06] was the line Leo the line the first
[8:10] coming of Christ for the Virgin the
[8:12] second coming by the Lion of the tribe
[8:15] of Judah I said I've tried my best to
[8:20] see that zodiac and I can't see it but
[8:22] yet it's there those who are trained no
[8:28] it's a joke saw it man used to look at
[8:33] it it was a Bible it one day but in that
[8:37] whole great mass of millions of billions
[8:40] of light years God sits in the midst of
[8:45] all of it and he looks down Paul is in
[8:50] there
[8:51] my mother's in there somewhere looking
[8:55] down and I thought of the ardor of that
[9:01] heavenly host not one of them's out of
[9:05] place everyone keeps it's timed
[9:09] perfectly God's great army a thought of
[9:15] the soldiers how that if that moon would
[9:20] happen to get out of order the earth
[9:22] would be covered again with water just
[9:23] in a few minutes the earth would be just
[9:27] like it was when God decided to use it
[9:30] for to have us here on it it was without
[9:32] form and void and darkness and water was
[9:36] up on the breadth of the earth if that
[9:39] moon would ever move it would do the
[9:41] same thing again when the moon rocks a
[9:43] little bit away from the earth the tides
[9:45] come up when it goes down just follows
[9:48] the tides it's God's
[9:51] are me when I thought about the that
[9:56] being God's great army they're not we
[10:00] went to bed and then I begin to think
[10:02] that not one of those get out of their
[10:04] place they all set in place and if
[10:10] there's a movie
[11:04] [Music]
[11:19] Lulla Henry hey on the floods many days
[11:31] he serves forlán him bury us the way
[11:44] bubbles he had some but not probable
[11:56] God gave us his son

[12:11] the show why God's in his cute sweet a
[12:22] sign from all the way the same sounds

[37:50] morning good to be back in the house of
[37:53] God so if you would let's go straight to
[37:56] our scripture same Scripture we read
[37:59] last week we appreciate the brother in
[38:02] the board I asked them if there was a
[38:04] possibility we can keep our series in a
[38:08] successive way so we can go all the way
[38:11] and finish it unless somebody's burning
[38:14] with something so we appreciate them for
[38:17] the grace that they have given unto us
[38:19] to go ahead and continue with this if
[38:23] Genesis chapter 15 verse 3 it's just a
[38:28] recap of the same Scripture we read last
[38:30] week we read 1 or 3 words and I let you
[38:34] be seated if you dare you can say Amen
[38:39] [Music]
[38:41] they give you 30 extra minute instead of
[38:44] 12:00 12:30 so you relax and be fine
[38:49] because we're going to get into deep
[38:51] water Genesis chapter 15 verse 3 and
[38:58] Abraham say behold to me you have given
[39:03] no seed and lo one born in my house is
[39:07] my hair and behold the word of the Lord
[39:09] came to him saying this shall not be
[39:13] your hair but he that shall come forth
[39:16] out of your own bowels shall be your
[39:19] hair
[39:20] we were talking about Eliezer of
[39:22] Damascus but God told him it's gonna be
[39:25] Isaac but that's the natural revelation
[39:31] then God move on into a different
[39:34] Horomia first father and he brought him
[39:36] forth abroad outside and say look toward
[39:40] the heaven and we mentioned yes week
[39:44] that the heaven is speaking about the
[39:46] zodiac and tell the star if you be able
[39:52] to number them God told Abraham go ahead
[39:56] and count the star but Abraham was not
[40:01] able to cut the star but be graceful
[40:05] today you gonna see there is one person
[40:07] that is able to count this star and he
[40:12] knows the numbers of this heart he's
[40:14] only one person and we're gonna see that
[40:16] person he said look now toward heaven
[40:20] and tell the stars if you be able to
[40:23] number them and he said to him so shall
[40:26] your seed singular be Paul taught us in
[40:31] the book of Galatians it's not plural
[40:34] it's angular which was speaking of
[40:37] Christ and who expressed to you last
[40:39] week that it's talking about the zodiac
[40:41] because in the earth in our sky we don't
[40:45] have any stars the star are in the
[40:48] universe in the zodiac so all of that
[40:51] speaks of Christ let's go to the book of
[40:55] Genesis still in the book of Genesis
[40:57] chapter 37 same scripture last week
[41:02] because we were halfway of our sermon so
[41:06] that's why I'm calling this sermon part
[41:08] four be so last week was part for a this
[41:14] is part four be because part five is
[41:16] already ready to go are you there
[41:18] Genesis chapter 37 verse nine and he
[41:23] dreamed talking about Joseph he had
[41:25] another dream and told it to enter did
[41:29] his brethren and say behold I have
[41:31] dreamed a dream more
[41:34] behold the Sun in the zodiac and the
[41:37] moon zodiac and the eleven star we know
[41:40] Benjamin was not born here so the birth
[41:43] of Benjamin was already in a star in
[41:47] other way there was a star in the zodiac
[41:50] that already represented Benjamin so one
[41:54] brain German he was born in this earth
[41:56] the zodiac already have something
[42:00] representing him because brother branham
[42:02] said before God does anything on this
[42:05] earth he first declare it in heaven so
[42:09] before even Benjamin was born his birth
[42:12] was already declared in the zodiac and
[42:15] Jacob mislead are you there 11 stars
[42:21] made obedience to me and he taught it to
[42:23] his father and to his brethren and his
[42:25] father rebuked him and say to him what
[42:28] is this dream that you have dreamed
[42:31] shall I Jacob is a son here he is
[42:35] representing himself as the son he is
[42:38] explaining the vision or the dream he
[42:41] says shall I and your mother
[42:43] we showed you last time that Jacob had
[42:46] four women
[42:48] so Leah Zilpah Bela and Rachel but in
[42:52] the zodiac the one represented was
[42:55] Rachel that's why Jeremiah said there is
[42:58] lamentation in Ramah nature he is crying
[43:01] for her children not we are not Zilpah
[43:03] but Rachel are you there those Prophet
[43:06] were line up with the zodiac and your
[43:10] brethren indeed come to bow down
[43:13] ourselves to you to the earth so there
[43:16] is something or a mystery hanging up
[43:19] there let's go to the book of Revelation
[43:21] chapter 12 you're gonna hear me all the
[43:24] time speaking about mysteries mysteries
[43:27] mysteries I am NOT preaching new
[43:30] mysteries I am preaching reveal
[43:33] mysteries the message of the hour is
[43:36] mysteries in the voice of the seventh
[43:41] angel all the mysteries this message is
[43:45] literacy
[43:46] I was talking to a brother on the
[43:50] telephone I say there is a different
[43:53] sound about this message when you preach
[43:56] it differently it is different than any
[43:59] kind of message Revelation chapter 12
[44:06] and there appear verse 1 a great wonder
[44:09] in heaven a woman clothed with the Sun
[44:12] again the Sun in the book of Genesis we
[44:15] know that Sun represented Jacob here
[44:18] there is another son but we have to find
[44:21] out what as this particular Sun
[44:24] represent but we glad brought a team
[44:27] Greely we have a prophet he knows that
[44:31] code when I say we have a prophet and
[44:33] the moon under her feet and upon her
[44:37] head a crown of twelve stars in Genesis
[44:41] 12 star the first book of the Bible
[44:44] Sun Moon trav star revelation last book
[44:48] of the Bible
[44:48] Sun Moon twelve star are you dead and
[44:52] she being with a child cried travailing
[44:55] in birth you might be seated as we
[44:57] continue crying cried travailing in
[45:01] birth and pained to be delivered and
[45:04] they appear another wonder in heaven we
[45:08] introduce here the constellation of
[45:10] Jericho which is the constellation of
[45:12] the dragon if you study that you see
[45:15] that that constellation is between the
[45:17] Big Dipper and the Little Dipper
[45:19] I didn't want to get on that detail
[45:22] there having seven heads and ten horns
[45:25] and seven Crown's upon his head and with
[45:28] his tail we talked about they tell of
[45:31] the serpent with his tail drew the third
[45:35] part of the stars of heaven so we're
[45:38] talking about stars here they are twelve
[45:41] stars but they are also other stars in
[45:45] heaven Abraham was stars
[45:48] Joseph twelve here twelve and other
[45:53] stars
[45:54] we gotta find who are these twelve stars
[45:56] and also
[45:59] the other stars are you there and then
[46:02] he stood before the woman which was
[46:04] ready to delivered for to devour her
[46:07] child as soon as he was born and she
[46:11] brought forth a man child which was
[46:13] Christ who was to rule all nations with
[46:15] a rod of iron and her child was caught
[46:18] up in other rapture to God and to his
[46:22] throne so I believe that's good for the
[46:27] reading of the word you might keep your
[46:28] Bible and make sure you comfortable at
[46:32] home cause we're gonna travel deep let's
[46:36] pray Heavenly Father Lord we thank you
[46:39] for your grace your love your mercy and
[46:42] for everything you're doing for us Lord
[46:44] father you have given us another
[46:46] opportunity and grace to be able to
[46:49] gather together and run they reveal word
[46:52] because you spoke in your word Lord
[46:54] father that's where the carcass is there
[46:57] the ego will gather Lord father your
[47:00] prophet toward us Lord father that's to
[47:02] have a fresh true revival we need to
[47:06] bring the people back to the word of the
[47:08] hour and that's what we do in Lord
[47:10] Father so that the book of fact alone
[47:13] once more Lord father can be written for
[47:16] spoken word Tabernacle father may you
[47:18] move me completely away may the Holy
[47:21] Spirit made inside the teacher may you
[47:25] come down this morning Lord father this
[47:27] afternoon father and Lord father nourish
[47:30] and quicken the heart of your children
[47:32] Lord ministered to them according to
[47:34] their need Lord be the Alpha and the
[47:36] Omega Lord touch those that are present
[47:38] here and those that are Lord father in
[47:41] an invisible audience Lord father we
[47:43] commit them unto the hand in the name of
[47:46] Jesus Christ amen
[47:47] god bless you so like I said last week
[47:51] was part 4 a and this is part 4 B of the
[47:55] unchanging pattern of God we express
[47:59] that Granum toward us that God has three
[48:01] bubble we want you to keep that concept
[48:03] when we talk about the zodiac always
[48:06] remember it's a bubble and brother
[48:08] branham say there was one written in the
[48:10] sky which is
[48:11] in the universe there was another one in
[48:14] the pyramid placed by Enoch and there
[48:17] was a third one brother Branham say it
[48:19] is what we have in the written word
[48:21] because it's the age of intellectual and
[48:24] God put it up in the print so that we
[48:26] can have it but the key there is the
[48:29] revelation in the written word and
[48:32] revelation in the pyramid and the
[48:34] revelation in the zodiac
[48:36] all those revelation they don't
[48:38] contradict one another so if you have
[48:41] some time difficulty understanding the
[48:44] zodiac you can refer back to the written
[48:47] word and you'll find out that the
[48:48] written word can open up something to
[48:51] you to understand this Odia sometimes if
[48:53] you cannot understand the pyramid if you
[48:56] go to the zodiac the zodiac might help
[48:58] you understand the pyramid that's why
[49:01] the last time that we spoke the other
[49:04] time that we spoke about the pyramid we
[49:06] first went with the two first sign of
[49:09] the zodiac the first which was the
[49:11] Virgin and then Leo the Lion once we
[49:14] understand what those two signs mean he
[49:16] already unlocked unto us the key to
[49:19] enter the pyramid and to see how the
[49:22] Bible or the message was written in the
[49:25] pyramid as long as you don't get those
[49:27] keys sometimes you can get long so all
[49:30] those three revelation line up together
[49:33] so last week when we start talking we
[49:36] went back to the zodiac and we insisted
[49:39] about the North Star because what
[49:42] Branham told us in the mystery of the
[49:44] North Star that the North Star was the
[49:47] center of God he also said that the send
[49:50] the North Star was the center of the
[49:53] zodiac everything in the zodiac revolve
[49:56] around enough star and brother Branham
[49:58] told us also that that same North Star
[50:01] was also the center of the earth
[50:03] so when Enoch came he knocked the
[50:07] pyramid and when Enoch built the pyramid
[50:10] we found out that Enoch geographically
[50:13] brother branham's they positioned the
[50:15] pyramid lining up straight to the center
[50:19] of the earth so if you can read in
[50:21] between the line because the
[50:24] sage is not really what you reading by
[50:28] pre-baby people are reading the Bible
[50:31] they don't understand what it means and
[50:32] many people are listening to the tips
[50:36] reading the message but still they don't
[50:39] get our remains because what Branham say
[50:43] a mystery is a truth that was first
[50:46] heated then that truth is revealed but
[50:50] rather Branham say even though the truth
[50:53] is revealed there is still a
[50:55] supernatural element that is locked in
[50:59] despite the revelation so we must
[51:02] connect with the supernatural element we
[51:06] must connect with Christ in order to
[51:09] understand the message of the hour if
[51:12] not your message will be intellectual
[51:14] you can fill your brain with a bunch of
[51:17] knowledge but your life will never
[51:19] change you can have a religious spirit
[51:22] or use this message just as another
[51:25] religion just as the Baptist as the
[51:29] Methodist as the Pentecostal but this is
[51:32] a message altogether different
[51:34] are you there so brother Branham when he
[51:37] told us that the center of the earth was
[51:40] the North Star and then he came back and
[51:43] he said ëno Center the pyramid in the
[51:46] center of the earth automatically in
[51:49] between the line brother Branham is
[51:51] telling you that Enoch line up the
[51:54] pyramid with the North Star and once the
[51:57] pyramid has been lined up with the North
[51:59] Star Vera Branham said no matter how the
[52:02] sun is shining around there is no shadow
[52:05] here on that pyramid the Sun can be on
[52:09] the east the Sun can be on the north the
[52:11] Sun can be on the south or whichever
[52:13] direction is there is no shadow to it
[52:16] and brother Branham insisted to the
[52:18] young people and to the young women
[52:21] he said line up with the knob star
[52:25] because in this life you want to go
[52:27] through difficulty trouble and
[52:29] everything but as long as you have the
[52:32] guide whatever I am preach a message the
[52:34] guy
[52:35] as long as you have the God as long as
[52:37] you have the enough start God will work
[52:40] you up through those difficulties God
[52:43] will help you up to overcome those
[52:45] difficulty because your eyes are still
[52:49] on the North Star
[52:50] are you there if you look in the book of
[52:53] Revelation you will see that when the
[52:56] New Jerusalem was coming down from
[52:58] heaven the New Jerusalem is a city also
[53:02] in the form of a pyramid but if you
[53:05] notice the scripture says when you look
[53:07] at the New Jerusalem on top of the city
[53:12] the land sit over there if you have a
[53:15] question just shoot brother David and
[53:18] then we go to the scripture I don't want
[53:20] to say brother Stephen saying I want you
[53:23] to say brother branham say or the Bible
[53:26] say why do you always say that the Bible
[53:29] say because brother Branham say the
[53:31] Bible is the absolute so if the Bible
[53:35] say brother Stephen why do you have to
[53:37] say again brother Branham say I say
[53:40] brother Branham say because the absolute
[53:43] interpretation of the Bible today is the
[53:46] message of the hour that's why I say the
[53:50] barbosa and brother Branham say are you
[53:53] there ok so when you look in the Bible
[53:56] you will find out that on top of the New
[53:59] Jerusalem they are there lying on the
[54:03] top of it there was a lamb bloody
[54:05] brother Fred usually sing in the city
[54:08] where the lamb is the light in the city
[54:12] where they cometh what no night if you
[54:16] look in the scripture you'll find that
[54:18] in the New Jerusalem the Bible says that
[54:20] there is no light either there is no
[54:24] night because on top of the pyramid the
[54:28] pyramid is Center with the logos with
[54:31] the Lord with Christ
[54:33] so once Christ is sitting there there is
[54:36] no more shadow there is no more darkness
[54:38] there is no more night there is no more
[54:41] trouble so that's why we insisted young
[54:44] people you go ahead and you land up with
[54:46] your Saudia that
[54:48] why the bubble when Solomon came Solomon
[54:51] say teach your children what bring up
[54:56] your child according or train your child
[54:59] according to the way but what is the way
[55:03] when Jesus Christ came he said I am the
[55:07] way the truth and the life because
[55:09] Solomon said if you train them according
[55:13] to the way in other word if you train
[55:15] the children according to Christ when
[55:18] they grow older they now go it's not
[55:21] going to depart from them and brother
[55:23] Branham when he came he say sometime
[55:26] they might depart from the way they can
[55:30] pax lead some time but the way won't
[55:33] depart from them
[55:35] are you there if you notice when Jada
[55:38] where now Daniel was in Babylon Daniel
[55:42] trained the babylonian how to study and
[55:45] to look at a star and when the
[55:48] babylonian were trained to look at a
[55:50] star they begin to understand and read
[55:53] the zodiac so when they were reading
[55:55] this earlier because they were trained
[55:58] by the scripture of daniel they were
[56:02] able to catch the birth of christ
[56:05] brother Branham said there was many star
[56:08] gazer there was many people in the earth
[56:11] but none of them knew that Christ was
[56:14] born he said the one that recognized the
[56:17] birth was the star gazer because they
[56:21] were trained by a prophet they knew how
[56:24] to look at the zodiac and when did they
[56:27] stop for two years no problem the way
[56:31] was given unto him the way was trained
[56:35] to them they were brought up under
[56:37] Daniel with the way and they were
[56:40] following the star but when they got
[56:43] closer to Jerusalem they begin to get
[56:47] influenced from Jerusalem they begin to
[56:51] think how big Jerusalem was they begin
[56:55] to think how it's the city of the Great
[56:58] King it's the City of God it is
[57:01] the spiritual city of the jewel so maybe
[57:05] the star or the cross must be born dead
[57:10] they were trained into the way but the
[57:14] reach a certain time in their life where
[57:17] they deviate I'm going slowly from the
[57:21] way and they enter into Jerusalem and
[57:25] they miss it brother Branham said that
[57:27] star stay outside
[57:29] are you that when they enter that they
[57:32] begin to ask the people where is the
[57:34] King of the Jews who's born and nobody
[57:36] knew there was a king that was born they
[57:39] were following Christ they were
[57:42] following the way they were following
[57:44] the star but they got caught up into
[57:47] denomination that's one when you enter
[57:51] in this message stay connected with
[57:54] Christ don't get into the click of the
[57:58] message don't get into the move of the
[58:03] message don't get into the ideas of the
[58:07] message because those idea can move you
[58:10] away from the principle or the main
[58:13] thing when the search Jerusalem they
[58:16] found out that he was lucky when they
[58:18] came out we're gonna say the star was
[58:20] standing ready and they begin to follow
[58:23] that same star and that same star led
[58:26] them to Bethlehem
[58:27] are you there that's why I got what I'm
[58:29] saying if you live crossed somewhere you
[58:32] need to go back to the place where you
[58:34] left them and that's where you're gonna
[58:36] find him
[58:37] still waiting for you so young people
[58:39] stay connected with Christ all people
[58:43] stay connected with Christ don't get
[58:45] caught up with Jerusalem don't get
[58:47] caught up with this preacher this
[58:49] preacher this preacher stay run up with
[58:52] Christ the message is Christ I cannot
[58:56] emphasize on to that praise God
[59:00] then when we begin to look at the 12
[59:02] major sign of the zodiac
[59:05] I'm just going to touch quickly and then
[59:08] we move on we found out that we talk
[59:11] about the Virgin we express the version
[59:15] that it was fulfilling their coming of
[59:17] the seed of the woman they coming of
[59:19] class who have to come to crush the head
[59:22] of the serpent
[59:22] because in Genesis God gave a promise
[59:25] God even expressed to us that the seed
[59:28] of the woman would crush their head or
[59:30] bruise the head of the serpent so that's
[59:33] why we are we explain the constellation
[59:36] of the Serpent's because in the zodiac
[59:39] the serpent itself has a constellation
[59:42] and we talk to you I believe he was part
[59:45] three if I'm not mistaken that the
[59:48] constellation if I can erase this slowly
[59:51] that's the constellation of the
[59:54] Serpent's was a constellation that was
[59:58] split into two if you remember there was
[1:00:02] a part of that constellation if I can
[1:00:05] job very good we're talking about a
[1:00:08] serpent here that was called the head of
[1:00:11] the serpent that's why we expressed with
[1:00:14] Moses that the constellation was head
[1:00:18] the head of the serpent because serpent
[1:00:22] kaput which means the head of the
[1:00:25] serpent and the other part of the
[1:00:28] constellation was called the tail of the
[1:00:31] serpent or serpent Cora Cora means tell
[1:00:35] are either
[1:00:36] and we express to you that when Moses
[1:00:39] came in God told Moses to touch the
[1:00:42] serpent by the tail not the head and we
[1:00:46] explained to you that they had will sing
[1:00:49] they tell was the attribute of sin
[1:00:52] that's one when Moses came in he heard
[1:00:55] them if someone committed adultery you
[1:00:58] need to kill him when Jesus Christ came
[1:01:01] in they brought a woman that committed
[1:01:05] adultery and they caught her on the very
[1:01:08] up so Moses the Ministry you have to
[1:01:12] manifest something physically for them
[1:01:17] to catch you so when their brother has
[1:01:19] said Moses taught us this woman if we
[1:01:22] find out we need to kill her but when
[1:01:25] Jesus Christ came Jesus mom
[1:01:28] find that to a certain level Jesus say
[1:01:32] you wait until a woman is caught into
[1:01:36] adultery to kill her
[1:01:38] that's not the problem what the woman
[1:01:41] what the man was doing is just a result
[1:01:45] of what happened in the heart
[1:01:51] that's why Jesus say if someone look I
[1:01:56] dare not go to the hotel and pay money
[1:02:00] and go with a woman and no that is just
[1:02:03] an attribute but once you look at woman
[1:02:08] Angeles after her you have already
[1:02:11] committed adultery in the heart
[1:02:15] so the adultery that you see somebody
[1:02:19] doing is already started in the heart
[1:02:22] the political Shoom that sin in the
[1:02:26] heart that ministry that mystery was
[1:02:29] unfolded by James let's take the book of
[1:02:32] James I didn't plan on this but I feel
[1:02:41] like we need to see it take the book of
[1:02:44] James you need to keep your Bible today
[1:03:00] if you dare you can say Amen
[1:03:08] are you there
[1:03:11] alright let's go to verse 13 chapter 1
[1:03:15] verse 13 the Bible say let no man say
[1:03:20] when he is tempted I am tempted of God
[1:03:23] these stuff are very essential that's
[1:03:26] why we want to make sure we drill them
[1:03:28] into the church for God cannot be
[1:03:32] tempted with evil neither tempteth he
[1:03:36] any men but every man watch now in
[1:03:40] stented
[1:03:42] when he's drawn away of his own lust
[1:03:46] everybody clear
[1:03:47] don't say brother Stephen say and entice
[1:03:51] so first of all you looked at a woman
[1:03:54] and you begin to last after him
[1:03:58] are we there now first feel of verse 3
[1:04:03] of 15 then when lust has conceived in
[1:04:08] other word when that last gave birth
[1:04:13] idea when that lust has conceived he
[1:04:18] brings forth sin and sin when it's
[1:04:24] finished
[1:04:25] oh but you bring forth death so James is
[1:04:31] telling you that same process first you
[1:04:34] the one that look at the woman then you
[1:04:37] lusted after her then when you lasted
[1:04:40] after her you consumed that sin in your
[1:04:43] heart you birth that adultery in your
[1:04:47] heart once adultery is birth in the
[1:04:52] heart then whatever you doing it's just
[1:04:56] a manifestation of what happened in the
[1:04:59] heart
[1:04:59] so Moses say you need to get the
[1:05:02] manifestation Jesus say go back to the
[1:05:06] source get him from the heart when you
[1:05:09] clean him rather then once the worshiper
[1:05:12] is purged there is no more desire for
[1:05:16] sin when he look at a woman
[1:05:19] automatically the love star move his
[1:05:21] head he's looking at a woman anymore
[1:05:24] because the knob star moves the head
[1:05:27] away straight hair is gone so when the
[1:05:30] constellation was expressing to heaven
[1:05:33] he was a constellation that was split
[1:05:36] into two one is the head of the serpent
[1:05:38] the other one was the tail of the
[1:05:41] serpent now if you look at this head of
[1:05:45] the serpent in the zodiac this head of
[1:05:48] the serpent was closer to the
[1:05:50] constellation Vigo which was the
[1:05:55] halation of christ the coming Redeemer
[1:06:00] of Christ to bruise the head of the
[1:06:05] serpent are we dead and in between the
[1:06:08] head and the tail
[1:06:11] there was another constellation I told
[1:06:13] you we going to get in deep water that
[1:06:16] constellation is the constellation of
[1:06:19] Lucas I let you google it yourself you
[1:06:24] know the constellation is a man I'm
[1:06:30] going slowly and this man hold the two
[1:06:36] side of the serpent and this man was
[1:06:41] called the serpent bearer again when the
[1:06:49] Roman look at this man they call him as
[1:06:54] clickers which was a hero God for him
[1:07:02] I'm going slowly are there and this man
[1:07:09] as clueless here had a rod rather of it
[1:07:17] I hope you connected he has a rod and
[1:07:21] the rod was into an with a snake and the
[1:07:29] Roman took this son and put it in
[1:07:33] medicine I didn't but brother branham
[1:07:40] told us that they make a huge aboard
[1:07:44] they make a perversion of the sodium
[1:07:48] they make a perversion of the pyramid
[1:07:52] they make a perversion of the rigid
[1:07:55] world but that still does not hinder the
[1:07:59] true message because when we go in the
[1:08:03] scripture we find the manual
[1:08:06] so that was bearing the serpent I let us
[1:08:10] down
[1:08:12] that man was Moses Moses had a rod
[1:08:20] when we try to the ground it's a serpent
[1:08:23] when he touch it
[1:08:25] it's a rodent when he goes to Egypt are
[1:08:29] you following me
[1:08:30] and he told us that the stuff he turn
[1:08:33] into a serpent
[1:08:34] so this constellation here was speaking
[1:08:38] about Moses in between the two
[1:08:43] dispossession bringing the law the law
[1:08:47] was a temporal resolution to hold sin
[1:08:51] don't commit adultery don't those still
[1:08:54] don't do this in just the temporary but
[1:08:57] they could not clean the worshiper are
[1:09:00] you there so it was a temporary solution
[1:09:03] to handle sin or to decrease the effect
[1:09:07] I didn't applaud the believer and once
[1:09:11] they do that Paul say before sin came
[1:09:15] before they lock him I was sweet go
[1:09:19] check Romans seven he said when the law
[1:09:22] came Sid Ruiz Vava
[1:09:26] look at 1:7 in other word when you bring
[1:09:30] a piece of cake and you put a cake on
[1:09:33] the table you say brother John say the
[1:09:36] whole family can eat that cake there is
[1:09:39] no problem and most of the time you will
[1:09:41] see somebody grabbing after a while
[1:09:43] nobody even pay attention to that cake
[1:09:45] are you there by this brother John bring
[1:09:48] his cake and brother John called si I
[1:09:51] don't want anybody to touch this cake
[1:09:55] down low magnifies fin then Lily who go
[1:10:01] running take my goodness how can daddy
[1:10:04] bring the cake and that and say don't
[1:10:06] touch it in other word temptation begin
[1:10:10] to take over because the law was placed
[1:10:13] there now everybody is interested about
[1:10:16] we need to get
[1:10:17] okay are you there that's what they'll
[1:10:20] or did so what Moses came in Moses when
[1:10:25] he brought the law per se in magnify sin
[1:10:28] because God wanted seemed to come out
[1:10:31] completely then he can chop the head of
[1:10:34] seed one time are you there
[1:10:37] so when the Roman put this on they call
[1:10:41] the son the son of medicine that's what
[1:10:44] they say but we found out that the
[1:10:46] serpent bearer was Moses and Moses also
[1:10:52] put up a sign are you there in the Bible
[1:10:56] and that son the Bible say in our John
[1:11:00] chapter 3 as Moses lifted up the serpent
[1:11:05] are you there in the wilderness so shall
[1:11:08] the Son of Man be also lifted up so they
[1:11:13] said this is for their God what is our
[1:11:17] prophet talking about design let's see
[1:11:21] what brother Branham say you know the
[1:11:28] stature of a perfect man I was talking
[1:11:31] to a doctor one time and he was just
[1:11:34] waking me over the cause a bad word
[1:11:37] divine healing was standing on the
[1:11:41] street he said mr. Branum you only
[1:11:45] confuse people say there is no healing
[1:11:49] only through out medics in other words
[1:11:52] through medical he happened to turn
[1:11:56] around
[1:11:57] watch carefully I believe you can see it
[1:12:00] on the screen look at his son on the car
[1:12:04] this is not woman
[1:12:06] this is Malachi 4 because at the voice
[1:12:10] of the seventh angel all the mystery of
[1:12:13] God must be revealed he said look at his
[1:12:16] son on the car had that serpent on a
[1:12:20] pole brother Stephen say no I say you
[1:12:27] better take off that subject
[1:12:30] son of your car then because your own
[1:12:33] sign testifies that God is a healer the
[1:12:40] Roman say he was the son of their God
[1:12:44] perversion brother Branham said the son
[1:12:48] of miracle is the son of Moses a real
[1:12:56] doctor believes that that's them quacks
[1:13:00] yes sir
[1:13:01] the serpent on the pole Moses lifted up
[1:13:05] the serpent on a pole he said I am the
[1:13:08] lord that heals all your diseases and
[1:13:12] they look at that serpent for divine
[1:13:15] healing another one praise God in the
[1:13:21] seventh year
[1:13:21] that's not even discussion here I was
[1:13:25] talking to one of the finest doctors
[1:13:27] there is in the southern state in his
[1:13:30] office not long ago a very fun
[1:13:32] specialist in Louisville a real gallant
[1:13:35] man and I said to him I say doctor I
[1:13:38] want to ask you a question he said all
[1:13:40] right I said I'm not this your medical
[1:13:44] Siler I am correcting the wrong teaching
[1:13:49] I didn't by the message of the hour and
[1:13:56] notice your medical sign the stuff you
[1:14:00] got a serpent wrapped around a pole what
[1:14:05] does that stand for he said I don't know
[1:14:08] and I say he stands for this brother
[1:14:12] Branham now is interpreting our zodiac I
[1:14:15] will stand for this
[1:14:19] he was a symbol of divine healing where
[1:14:23] Moses lifts up the brass serpent in the
[1:14:26] wilderness it which was only a symbol
[1:14:29] only a symbol of the true cross now
[1:14:35] today medicine is a symbol of divine
[1:14:39] healing and through many of them don't
[1:14:44] and don't many of them don't believe it
[1:14:46] will good doctrines do believe it but
[1:14:49] some of them don't believe it but
[1:14:52] they're very and lemma either the emblem
[1:14:57] of a serpent in the pole is not the
[1:15:00] emblem of Roman god it is the emblem of
[1:15:05] Moses which was representing Jesus
[1:15:09] Christ are you there
[1:15:11] the emblem that they hold up testify the
[1:15:16] power of Almighty God whether they want
[1:15:20] to believe it or not whether you take
[1:15:23] brother Branham or not that's your
[1:15:25] problem
[1:15:26] I believe brother Branham I am convinced
[1:15:30] therefore I am concerned hallelujah see
[1:15:33] that's right there is the brass serpent
[1:15:37] hanging on the pole on the medical and
[1:15:40] bloom so when you look at this
[1:15:43] constellation right here in spoke about
[1:15:45] they tell the attribute of the serpent
[1:15:48] of sin and Moses comes right in between
[1:15:52] trying to hold the two pieces together
[1:15:54] until we go comes the head of the woman
[1:15:58] bringing cross to crush the head of the
[1:16:01] serpent any question this message is not
[1:16:09] something to play around now as we begin
[1:16:13] to maneuver over this son we express to
[1:16:17] you that the other son was the sacrifice
[1:16:22] we talk about the ordered error which
[1:16:25] was showing the direction then we talk
[1:16:28] about the twins
[1:16:29] which was Judah and Jesus and Judah came
[1:16:33] back on the church as the spirit of the
[1:16:35] white horse if you can remember last
[1:16:37] time which expressed the Sagittarius
[1:16:40] which was the center and that spoke
[1:16:42] about the vessel then the lion anointing
[1:16:45] came up to fight him then the devil
[1:16:48] changed to the word horse rather then
[1:16:50] the officer 19 came to
[1:16:52] follow death as a victory then dead
[1:16:55] [Music]
[1:16:57] Oh they'd ever change to the third sill
[1:17:00] because on the turn sir the devil's
[1:17:03] coming up with a scale which was
[1:17:04] speaking about Libra which was coming
[1:17:07] with a scale now what we are buying this
[1:17:09] son here this son does not apply now to
[1:17:14] your individual life I don't want you to
[1:17:17] look at people that are born under Libra
[1:17:19] saying the devil of the church still
[1:17:21] though this is applying to the church
[1:17:24] changes we're going to get to your
[1:17:26] individual life are you there and then
[1:17:29] when the devil come into the full force
[1:17:33] to the third horse rider
[1:17:35] we found out that Luther came up as a
[1:17:38] Capricorn as the spirit of men are you
[1:17:42] there the anointing of men and looters
[1:17:44] standard as a fish if you remember last
[1:17:49] week the gospel then ended up being a
[1:17:52] good and we were trying to find Wesley
[1:17:55] so now make sure your seatbelts are
[1:17:58] buckled up pretty good so we had to sign
[1:18:01] left here one was the cross fish is
[1:18:04] brother Michael oh Mack buckle up please
[1:18:07] he knows what I'm prayin saying that he
[1:18:09] certainly it takes last week so and then
[1:18:12] over there we have the cancer so we were
[1:18:16] trying first to remove the cancer we
[1:18:19] found out that when the angel of the
[1:18:20] Lord met brother Branham he only
[1:18:23] mentioned cancer there were 39 sort of
[1:18:28] category of disease but he only
[1:18:31] mentioned cancer telling what a problem
[1:18:33] that you are living in the age of cancer
[1:18:37] either so but when we win it brother
[1:18:41] branham brother branham keep taking the
[1:18:45] cross wishes and the cancer and sometime
[1:18:49] it separate and most of the time he
[1:18:52] mixes together but when a made a mistake
[1:18:56] no in the message have anacs-- nd first
[1:19:02] time cross Graham was through the Virgin
[1:19:05] next time he comes through the Lion of
[1:19:07] the tribe of Judah the cross fishes
[1:19:12] separate the cancer age comma and all as
[1:19:18] you read it through as job studied
[1:19:21] because we saw that job was the one who
[1:19:24] was looking at the Pleiades and the
[1:19:26] little bear and things like that taking
[1:19:29] up the armor of God now this is the
[1:19:31] problem he said what does the zodiac
[1:19:34] star of the Virgin what does he end with
[1:19:36] Leo de Lyonne the first coming of Christ
[1:19:39] and the second coming of Christ we are
[1:19:41] now in the cross wishes the edges say
[1:19:45] cancer a brother madam say cross wishes
[1:19:49] we choose the cancer age component but
[1:19:58] today we're going to it up on you
[1:20:01] there now when you look at the son of
[1:20:05] fishes I'm gonna go now slowly the son
[1:20:11] of the fishes have to fish not three not
[1:20:15] four true fishes and we also know that
[1:20:21] fishes represent the gospel and it
[1:20:25] speaks of believers I'm going slowly
[1:20:28] because when Jesus met Peter he said
[1:20:32] Peter you are fishing natural fish you
[1:20:36] come up here I'm gonna make you fishers
[1:20:39] of men not rich men even in the vision
[1:20:44] of the rainbow trout of the third Pole
[1:20:48] the rainbow trout which is a fish with
[1:20:52] the rainbow D covenant and I need to be
[1:20:56] clutched by the third pole that was
[1:20:58] representing the believer in that vision
[1:21:02] but one of the rules he was teaching
[1:21:05] preachers how to catch fish and the
[1:21:09] angel of the Lord said I told you don't
[1:21:11] teach Pentecostal
[1:21:14] don't teach those babies these kind of
[1:21:17] things and he gave brother Branham a
[1:21:20] vision well brother Branham has a
[1:21:22] Shoeless follow me
[1:21:25] very careful it was a big shoeless
[1:21:28] shoeless
[1:21:30] but brother branham had a small baby
[1:21:33] shoe so brother God was trying to get
[1:21:37] the big shoeless shoeless and trying to
[1:21:42] put it on the eyelid of the small baby
[1:21:46] shoe and God can he say you are trying
[1:21:51] to teach baby technical stuff spiritual
[1:21:57] swing supernatural things so damn
[1:22:02] shoeless brother branham the angel
[1:22:06] explained to her goddamn that's the
[1:22:07] Shoeless was that supernatural either
[1:22:13] because they came to rather bottom they
[1:22:15] said why do you struck women and all
[1:22:18] this kind of stuff teach us the big
[1:22:21] supernatural things of God but when I'm
[1:22:24] say if you don't understand your ABCs
[1:22:26] there is no way I can teach you algebra
[1:22:29] so when brother Branham was trying to
[1:22:32] teach them the first ball he said you do
[1:22:34] this and then you do this the second
[1:22:37] pool then the the impersonation came God
[1:22:40] say you are taking supernatural stuff
[1:22:43] you are taking the shoelace and you are
[1:22:46] trying to teach it taught to the baby
[1:22:50] the shoelace represented the
[1:22:53] supernatural are you there and when John
[1:22:58] the Baptist came and let us think okay
[1:23:03] John the Baptist say I am NOT wanted to
[1:23:07] do it I'm either I'm not waiting to
[1:23:12] unlock his shoelace John the Baptist
[1:23:17] found himself not worthy to touch the
[1:23:21] supernatural
[1:23:22] that's why the Bible st. John did no
[1:23:26] miracle you need Molotov
[1:23:34] or to go get to that one are you there
[1:23:37] are you there so let me come back to
[1:23:43] where I am so we find out that those two
[1:23:45] fishes we're too so why are they - why
[1:23:49] are they not four or five so first of
[1:23:52] all fish talking about the believer
[1:23:54] speaking about the gospel we already
[1:23:57] understand that then the second part
[1:23:59] fish lives and travel in water we have
[1:24:07] two fishes which we know speak about two
[1:24:13] believers and we know that fish travel
[1:24:19] in order and we know that water
[1:24:23] according to revelation 17 multitude of
[1:24:31] people so this is zodiac Sun is telling
[1:24:38] us that there are two believer I'm going
[1:24:43] surely that will be traveling into the
[1:24:47] multitude of the people
[1:24:49] - believer speaking about the gospel
[1:24:53] carrying the gospel in the multitude of
[1:24:56] the people now take your Bible
[1:25:00] relax give me my timer and let's get
[1:25:04] there let's go to the book of Mark
[1:25:08] chapter 6 those who are here have a
[1:25:11] benefit they already got a scripture on
[1:25:14] the board if you dare you can say Amen
[1:25:20] mark chapter 6 you there you can say a
[1:25:24] man what a devil are they saying amen
[1:25:29] okay praise God
[1:25:31] mark 6 verse 7 and he called unto his
[1:25:39] 12:12 disciple specific and began to do
[1:25:44] it
[1:25:48] when God sent someone the sending of
[1:25:56] somebody means apostle or missionary say
[1:26:09] an apostle or a missionary is somebody
[1:26:13] that is said if you need a coat I help
[1:26:17] him you see me and the Bible say that he
[1:26:24] began to send missionary
[1:26:27] apostle send them forth how why did
[1:26:34] Jesus send them to edit on he begin to
[1:26:39] send them by - and - and give them power
[1:26:43] over unclean spirit when Jesus was
[1:26:46] sending the disciple to go preach the
[1:26:48] gospel he began to send them to - - and
[1:26:52] we find out that the price is have to
[1:26:55] fish
[1:26:58] take the Book of Luke chapter 10 Radek
[1:27:02] Alima this is steak this is not
[1:27:09] appetizer are you there verse 1 Luke
[1:27:15] chapter 10 verse 1 are they saying Amen
[1:27:18] brother David okay Luke chapter 10 verse
[1:27:24] 1 if you dare you can say Amen someone
[1:27:27] say Amen okay praise God after these
[1:27:31] things the Lord appointed other
[1:27:34] certainly the first time he was 12
[1:27:38] this damaged 70 other 70 also and sent a
[1:27:45] post-op missionary and sent them two and
[1:27:50] two are we there before his faith in
[1:27:56] every city and place we
[1:27:58] he himself would come so the gospel when
[1:28:02] Jesus was sending the disciple to preach
[1:28:05] the gospel to be apostle to be
[1:28:08] missionary Jesus was sending them two by
[1:28:12] two when Sam stone wanted to destroy the
[1:28:17] field of the Philistine he took two
[1:28:20] foxes let me get the swim brother Dean I
[1:28:26] hope I didn't join you he took two foxes
[1:28:30] and put fire today then he sent them to
[1:28:35] the to the field to destroy the
[1:28:38] Philistine - - - - but those foxes
[1:28:43] myself fire the word became flesh now
[1:28:53] John the Beloved the Revelator and John
[1:28:56] there is a revival John is here in the
[1:28:59] Bible but John Saint John the one we are
[1:29:02] speaking of this morning an apostle of
[1:29:04] the Lord Jesus Christ a missionary said
[1:29:08] that by God a missionary is one that is
[1:29:12] sad they're very word itself mean one
[1:29:17] that is said if you need more I have 36
[1:29:21] are you there praise God
[1:29:24] let's go to Matthew number chapter 14 we
[1:29:28] are trying to decode the zodiac brother
[1:29:34] Michael mark now it's your turn
[1:29:40] Matthew chapter 14 verse 17 if you dare
[1:29:43] you can say men did they say men of
[1:29:46] their word David Oh God and they say
[1:29:50] unto him we have here but what five
[1:29:55] loaves and where the Stephen say two
[1:30:04] fishes he said bring them in here - and
[1:30:07] he commanded the multitude to sit down
[1:30:10] on the
[1:30:11] and took the five loaves and the two
[1:30:13] fishes and look up to heaven he blessed
[1:30:17] and brake and gave them love to his
[1:30:19] disciple and they disciple to the
[1:30:21] multitude and they did all eat and were
[1:30:24] filled and they took up the fragment and
[1:30:26] he remained two loaves are two pieces
[1:30:32] father loves to have remaining let's go
[1:30:38] to Matthew chapter 15 the next the next
[1:30:41] chapter Matthew 15 verse 15 verse 34 if
[1:30:46] you dare you can say Amen okay if
[1:30:49] somebody says a man we good
[1:30:52] okay praise God and Jesus say unto them
[1:30:56] how many loaves have you and they say
[1:31:00] seven and what you see loo fishes we
[1:31:06] don't know how many fishes here he only
[1:31:09] says few and few speaks of minority
[1:31:15] rather rather to hope you awake please
[1:31:19] God and he commanded the multitude to
[1:31:21] sit down on the ground he took the seven
[1:31:24] loaves and the fishes and gave thanks
[1:31:26] and brake them and give to his disciple
[1:31:28] and the disciple to the multitude same
[1:31:30] thing and they did all eat and were
[1:31:32] filled and they took up the broken meat
[1:31:34] and he was left word okay we get into
[1:31:39] the mathematics of God if you need a
[1:31:43] code for that one you see me we found
[1:31:47] out here that Jesus and the disciple two
[1:31:52] by two your fishes to go preached the
[1:31:56] gospel and they were missionary and when
[1:31:59] Jesus wanted to feed people this was
[1:32:02] natural but if you look on the spiritual
[1:32:06] there is a message lying riding Jesus
[1:32:10] took two fishes the number don't change
[1:32:16] plus five loaves loves speak
[1:32:24] bread which is the word I'm going slowly
[1:32:30] but this word is the world of growth I'm
[1:32:37] going slowly five speak of grace he gets
[1:32:43] two fishes either with the gospel of
[1:32:48] grace to feed the people when the people
[1:32:55] are fed he remains a basket thank you
[1:33:03] the number of worship after the gentle
[1:33:09] church urges eat the ministry is done
[1:33:14] through twelve basket relax on the next
[1:33:21] chapter he get three no fishes which is
[1:33:25] the minority plus seven loaves
[1:33:35] settlements completion this was found
[1:33:40] the other one was Southern Cross wake up
[1:33:46] I hope you gather and then when we feed
[1:33:53] the people they remain seven seven does
[1:33:58] not change but for magnified to twelve
[1:34:03] to bring worship today but number one if
[1:34:10] you look at these fishes there were dead
[1:34:13] fishes we are in the deep water either
[1:34:21] you die to our fish that took the fish
[1:34:28] other water they kill it you following
[1:34:34] me
[1:34:34] then they clean up the
[1:34:37] fish you follow me then that season the
[1:34:42] fish then they put the fish into the
[1:34:45] fire shake yourself a home before you
[1:34:54] preach this gospel
[1:34:56] you must be taken out of the world you
[1:35:00] must die to your sin you must be cleaned
[1:35:03] up and sanctified and God you have to
[1:35:07] bring the Baptist Messiah then they can
[1:35:14] combine you with the five robes to
[1:35:17] preach the gospel of grace and they can
[1:35:20] combine you with the seven loaves to
[1:35:22] carry the seven course meal where do you
[1:35:30] get stuff like this let's go back there
[1:35:34] buddy
[1:35:35] Redemption by power and now none of it
[1:35:39] to remain everything talking about the
[1:35:42] lamb he said when you eat it don't eat
[1:35:46] it raw or sudden but you must eat it
[1:35:52] well cook radically Matisse's well-done
[1:35:56] steak and I like that people trying to
[1:36:02] eat the word and they take it like that
[1:36:05] it was wrong chew it and spit it on and
[1:36:08] everything say oh I just can't take it I
[1:36:11] can't stand it it is not cooked done in
[1:36:14] us that's all watch it now
[1:36:17] he said cook it with fire fire presently
[1:36:26] that fish must be taken out of order
[1:36:29] clean up and then the back but does that
[1:36:33] fish which the Holy Ghost with fire
[1:36:36] that's why Bradham said nobody have a
[1:36:39] right to preach the gospel without the
[1:36:41] Baptist what's the whole
[1:36:43] ghosts represent the holy ghost
[1:36:48] you get God in your heart first he shall
[1:36:52] cook it for you like it's cooking now
[1:36:54] that's right
[1:36:55] cook it out what done and what daddy
[1:37:04] touched good let's go to the dedication
[1:37:09] of the building let me drop down here
[1:37:12] may there be such a feeling here of the
[1:37:15] blessedness of crust the sweetness of
[1:37:17] the spirit until men and women who
[1:37:20] follow from all part of the city and
[1:37:22] around about to hear the gospel from
[1:37:24] here made this congregation so be what
[1:37:27] season and what with what with the
[1:37:33] baptism of the Holy Ghost until they are
[1:37:35] called the salt of the earth so this
[1:37:38] finishes the two phases must be seasoned
[1:37:42] shorted with fire they bubble say that
[1:37:50] the law was given by Moses but grace and
[1:37:53] truth came by word
[1:37:57] so first the gospel of grace have to be
[1:38:01] preached to the Jetta after the gentle
[1:38:05] finish and dawn then twelve baskets are
[1:38:09] left for the twelve tribe of Israel
[1:38:16] let's go back here my brother zechariah
[1:38:19] 10 i will pour out upon pour upon the
[1:38:25] house of David and upon the inhabitants
[1:38:27] of Jerusalem the spirit of what the
[1:38:30] gospel of grace must be given to the
[1:38:32] Jews but when he grieved to the Jews it
[1:38:36] is twelve and twelve speak of worship
[1:38:39] and Jesus taught the disciple he says
[1:38:43] and the true worshipers shall worship
[1:38:46] the father in work and in water that's
[1:38:50] the Father for the father seeketh - it's
[1:38:54] a ghost
[1:38:55] that's gonna preach to the hundred and
[1:38:57] forty-four thousand to bring them true
[1:38:59] worship everybody let's dig deeper in
[1:39:09] the message of grace but when I'm speak
[1:39:12] about the zero bubble and the coming
[1:39:14] stone and when the stone comes but they
[1:39:17] say grace grace double grace not just
[1:39:21] good grace and grace both of them mixed
[1:39:25] together grace but grace oh my god let's
[1:39:32] let brother Branham interpret Zachariah
[1:39:34] listen very carefully I just read you
[1:39:37] the scripture where the bottom is gonna
[1:39:39] interpret Zachariah 12 prophesied this
[1:39:43] about 2500 years ago it was just about
[1:39:45] to take place
[1:39:46] listen and it shall come to pass in that
[1:39:48] day that I was sick to destroy all the
[1:39:51] nations that come against Jerusalem and
[1:39:53] I will pour upon the house of David
[1:39:55] brother Branham is explaining it the
[1:39:57] house of David and upon the inhabitants
[1:39:59] of Jerusalem the Spirit of God and
[1:40:02] supplication and they shall look upon me
[1:40:05] whom they have pierced
[1:40:07] they Gentile already have that because
[1:40:10] we recognize Jesus as the Messiah not
[1:40:12] the Jews I'm gonna go slowly
[1:40:15] now when the gospel returning to the Jew
[1:40:18] what is the gospel return to the Jews
[1:40:20] when the day of the Gentiles finished
[1:40:23] the gospel is ready to go back to the
[1:40:26] Jews oh if I could just tell you
[1:40:29] something that is about to happen right
[1:40:33] in this hour day either this great thing
[1:40:40] that is about to happen will carry over
[1:40:45] to revelation 11 revelation 11 is Moses
[1:40:50] and Elijah preaching today we're gonna
[1:40:54] be saying there is something that's
[1:40:56] going to happen in my ministry apart
[1:40:59] from the
[1:41:00] spell of grace that I have been
[1:41:02] preaching there is a second part of my
[1:41:05] ministry that is going to happen to me
[1:41:07] but that second part will carry over to
[1:41:10] the Jews
[1:41:12] I'm going slowly regulation 11 and pick
[1:41:16] up those two witnesses Moses and Elijah
[1:41:19] those two prophets Moses and Elijah
[1:41:24] turning the gospel back to them we are
[1:41:28] ready for it
[1:41:28] everything is in order as the Jews
[1:41:31] brought the message to the Gentile by
[1:41:34] rejection of Christ even so the gentle
[1:41:37] would take that robe back to the Jews by
[1:41:40] what the Gentile kicking quest out of
[1:41:42] the touch rejection of Christ and the
[1:41:44] rapture will come are you there
[1:41:46] now let's get to the features quickly
[1:41:49] and so Rob Appell we know it's the
[1:41:51] greatest priests that come up let me
[1:41:53] skip this one let's go right here
[1:41:54] neither will a Christian eat on a dead
[1:41:59] carrion from or denomination doctrine
[1:42:01] they want the Word of God
[1:42:04] fresh promise for our God promise
[1:42:07] rabbits in the day of Luton he promised
[1:42:09] other things in the day of other but now
[1:42:11] he promised us a full square meal the
[1:42:15] full seven-course meal seven bread
[1:42:20] either the servant for all the servants
[1:42:24] here are open everything is ready for
[1:42:27] the Word of God and what we call
[1:42:30] servants here to the Jews it is the
[1:42:34] southern trumpet there is no new message
[1:42:38] that will come up after this message
[1:42:41] that's why when the gospel goes back to
[1:42:44] the Jews the same message of the hour
[1:42:47] will be again brought to the Jews but
[1:42:50] it's called the seven trumpet twelve
[1:42:54] thousand twelve but seven does not
[1:42:58] change seven loves seven basket the
[1:43:01] number don't change seven seals seven
[1:43:03] trumpet the number don't change I told
[1:43:11] you I'm gonna take you in deep water the
[1:43:14] Fist of the chopper now notice the
[1:43:16] continuity of the scripture exactly the
[1:43:18] same under the seventh chop it is to
[1:43:21] Israel the same as death was today let
[1:43:26] me drop down here notice the losing of
[1:43:29] this ecclesiastical spirit I told you
[1:43:31] about the two the twins now 20 years
[1:43:35] later after that work we see the losing
[1:43:37] of the ecclesiastical spirit what under
[1:43:40] the seventh day seven today and then so
[1:43:47] we have far droves bringing the gospel
[1:43:50] of Christ and then we got the mystery of
[1:43:54] the opening of the seventh year but he
[1:43:57] won't change it will go there but still
[1:44:00] this number seven will also bring
[1:44:03] worship watch out this is the time when
[1:44:11] everything must what we worship and
[1:44:14] we'll remember how appropriate
[1:44:16] now don't let us miss this now listen
[1:44:19] when all the mysteries of the church age
[1:44:22] is was finished when all the mysteries
[1:44:25] of the planks of redemption
[1:44:27] then what 7 she was right immediately
[1:44:32] after this it is done for all everything
[1:44:36] in heaven and earth to do what are
[1:44:41] either down here we listen water what
[1:44:48] worship this was the elder the Beast
[1:44:52] everything fell right before him see
[1:44:55] that when he made his complete plan it's
[1:44:58] Dom of what so far gospel of grace going
[1:45:03] back bringing
[1:45:05] worship to the Jews and the seven field
[1:45:08] going back here bringing again what
[1:45:11] worship worship worship the one is seven
[1:45:16] thousand it takes just one octave of
[1:45:19] grace
[1:45:25] hallelujah let's go back to our
[1:45:28] Philadelphia churches we found out that
[1:45:30] there is two fishes preaching the gospel
[1:45:33] those two fishes are what missionary
[1:45:36] they are what apostle we are trying to
[1:45:38] bring Wesley now if you can bring the
[1:45:43] camera to them update a tradition of the
[1:45:47] seven temperature changes which age
[1:45:49] Philadelphian now listen carefully don't
[1:45:52] say brother Steven see Revelation 3:8 I
[1:45:55] know that works behold I have said
[1:45:57] before doing what an open door and no
[1:46:01] man can shut it but what I'm interpret
[1:46:04] now we will specifically let me go
[1:46:08] slowly dwell on the open door that no
[1:46:12] man can shut first of all I want to
[1:46:14] dwell on the open door as signifying the
[1:46:18] word tremendous what missionary effort
[1:46:24] of that touch you see a passage let me
[1:46:29] drop again look well call a new
[1:46:32] missionary endeavor for the Lord
[1:46:35] err no pendo first correction to have
[1:46:38] furthermore when I came to throw us to
[1:46:40] preach Christ's gospel and a door was
[1:46:42] opened unto me so we can see by the
[1:46:45] comparison of the scripture that this
[1:46:48] open door signified the greatest
[1:46:52] spreading of the gospel to the world
[1:46:56] that have ever seen the two fishes
[1:46:59] traveling in the water brother Steven
[1:47:06] can I have one more to confirm this yes
[1:47:09] my brother or sister you're going to get
[1:47:11] it deciding Church edges the wind blown
[1:47:18] and the little tassel fell off like that
[1:47:22] entropy that is Wesley sanctification
[1:47:27] see that was the greatest missionary
[1:47:31] edge we have ever had has been there
[1:47:36] Wesley
[1:47:38] search in during the time of Wesley if
[1:47:42] an exceed this edge is separating that
[1:47:46] from now addition the Westland churches
[1:47:49] he was a missionary in scattered
[1:47:53] scattered the two pieces godsend that
[1:47:58] the two pieces so why is brother Branham
[1:48:02] taking Wesley and putting Leslie with
[1:48:06] the cancer you there whatever I bet
[1:48:10] followed is good in order to understand
[1:48:14] the worth of training involved in behold
[1:48:16] I have set before you an open door and
[1:48:20] no man can shut it we trying to now see
[1:48:24] why brother Branham is combining them
[1:48:26] listen very carefully
[1:48:28] don't say brother Branham messed up we
[1:48:31] must now recall what has been said about
[1:48:35] each age running over into another age
[1:48:40] overlapping okay ready John there is an
[1:48:46] overlapping a melting or fading into it
[1:48:50] even though the church ages have
[1:48:52] specific date when the random said they
[1:48:55] didn't stop like that they stopped by
[1:48:58] one age beginning into another age and
[1:49:02] ending into another it is called the
[1:49:04] principle of overlapping okay reading
[1:49:10] into rather than an abrupt end a
[1:49:16] clear-cut it doesn't stop like that they
[1:49:19] age left into another age okay this edge
[1:49:24] which age Philadelphia the age of Wesley
[1:49:28] the age of the Pisces watch very
[1:49:32] carefully this age all the flow this age
[1:49:39] particularly flows into the message
[1:49:45] we're gonna say the Pisces is flowing
[1:49:48] into the castle
[1:49:54] Alleluia and not only does this edge of
[1:49:58] the floor okay into the last stage but
[1:50:05] the last stage what's very careful is in
[1:50:10] many respect simply carrying on of the
[1:50:14] six edge that's why the random is saying
[1:50:21] cross wishes cancerous cross wishing
[1:50:25] cancer e brother branham is saying that
[1:50:27] the six edge if you look clearly the
[1:50:30] seven edge is just a cameraman of the
[1:50:34] six H they said down here if you can
[1:50:42] just think of the season you can get a
[1:50:45] very good picture of it they plant that
[1:50:48] you see growing in full strength in
[1:50:50] summer suddenly appear to be going to
[1:50:53] see you can't tell exactly when summer
[1:50:57] became autumn we cannot tell we just
[1:51:00] know that the temperature is changing
[1:51:01] but when we don't know it just fed into
[1:51:05] it that is how the edges are and
[1:51:09] especially these last two they fell into
[1:51:13] each other
[1:51:14] that's why cross wishes cancer cross
[1:51:18] wishes cancer brother branham and make
[1:51:21] mistake then when this came Luther
[1:51:27] Wesley for him then the antic was
[1:51:30] changed and he picked up the pelvis
[1:51:33] rather and the cancer which is death but
[1:51:36] when he picked up the cancer age then
[1:51:39] there is another anointing they have to
[1:51:42] come to combat him that anointing now
[1:51:45] bring us to the constellation of the ego
[1:51:48] shake yourself
[1:51:50] couch of seatbelt you are home so let me
[1:51:54] give me give me grace now the
[1:51:57] constellation of ego is called the
[1:52:01] Aquila constellation
[1:52:04] there is a man in the Bible that was
[1:52:06] married to a woman the woman is called
[1:52:09] Priscilla you will see Aquila and
[1:52:12] Priscilla Aquila and Priscilla if you
[1:52:15] look at the word Aquila
[1:52:16] it means ego if you need a scripture
[1:52:20] right there okay there is a
[1:52:23] constellation called
[1:52:25] the Aquila constellation or the ego
[1:52:27] constellation the constellation have
[1:52:30] twelve star now we are getting into our
[1:52:33] scripture are you dead and the brightest
[1:52:38] star in the constellation the broadest
[1:52:41] of four star in that constellation is
[1:52:45] called altar you can google it if you
[1:52:50] want it
[1:52:50] what has Ultra me okay when we study our
[1:52:56] scripture we found out that Joseph's
[1:52:59] dream have 11 star the Sun and the moon
[1:53:02] and Joseph right in the middle which is
[1:53:05] a star 2 and Joseph told us that the Sun
[1:53:09] represented Jacob and then the moon
[1:53:13] represented version the zodiac
[1:53:16] interpreted then in the book of
[1:53:19] Revelation we found a woman pregnant
[1:53:22] with a star with the Sun and also the
[1:53:26] moon at her feet but that woman also has
[1:53:29] 12 star make sure you buckle up pretty
[1:53:32] good
[1:53:33] now what does this woman here signified
[1:53:39] let's go to Malachi 4 over there we
[1:53:42] found out it was the tribe patriarch and
[1:53:44] Jacob and Rachel the mark of the beast
[1:53:49] what does a woman represent the church
[1:53:53] clear this is the brand this is the
[1:53:57] church the real church a woman clothed
[1:53:59] with the Sun brother Branham is
[1:54:01] interpreted and the moon under her feet
[1:54:05] the servant head the moon under her feet
[1:54:08] the Sun was the dispensation of grace
[1:54:12] and the moon was the dispensation of
[1:54:17] the wrong the woman was the Orthodox
[1:54:20] Church and she was standing over the law
[1:54:23] the law was passing away
[1:54:26] it was a overlapping Jesus is bringing a
[1:54:30] gospel of grace and the law health to
[1:54:32] give away that's Paul said that the law
[1:54:35] become obsolete right then
[1:54:38] death law was passing away because law
[1:54:42] was a shadow of good things to come is
[1:54:45] that right
[1:54:46] the moon is only a shadow of the Sun
[1:54:49] reflecting now let's drop down so we
[1:54:52] understand the Sun grace the moon law
[1:54:57] now the twelve star and under her feet
[1:55:00] and upon her head a crown of twelve
[1:55:02] stars the church is burned with the
[1:55:05] doctrine of what if you need more code
[1:55:09] see me so brother Branham explained to
[1:55:12] us that the Sun over here is grace the
[1:55:19] moon was the dispensation of the law and
[1:55:21] then the twelve star the 12 apostel 12
[1:55:25] star in her kron four's 12 what apostle
[1:55:29] that the 12 apostel was the glory or the
[1:55:33] crowning of the new testament for no
[1:55:36] other foundation can be laid the night
[1:55:39] which is already laid see it's the
[1:55:41] foundation the New Testament the a
[1:55:43] personal the doctrine of the apostle and
[1:55:45] so forth is funding crown of the New
[1:55:49] Testament so this son dispensation of
[1:55:53] grace the moon dispensation of the law
[1:55:56] what about Jacob brother Branham German
[1:56:04] election in Abraham are you clear
[1:56:09] justification in Isaac Gracie would
[1:56:15] clear anybody dies the red Jacobs life
[1:56:21] no you have to believe in grace
[1:56:24] it's gross in Jacob
[1:56:28] the identified masterpiece of God Jacob
[1:56:33] which means supplanter and that is a
[1:56:36] deceiver and we lost that Jacob life
[1:56:39] really represented because he was all
[1:56:45] the time with Jacob your son grace your
[1:56:54] moon Bella Jacob son grace if you notice
[1:57:08] Rachel when they come to marry him
[1:57:12] either
[1:57:14] Jacob work seven years and he was in
[1:57:19] terrible to get richer when he was dead
[1:57:22] to get richer his father no swap nature
[1:57:26] to Leah when he woke up in the morning
[1:57:29] he say hey this is not my wife this is
[1:57:33] Leah and they open up to him the law
[1:57:40] lets the sick either they say there is a
[1:57:45] custom there is a law here before you
[1:57:49] get the younger you must get the order
[1:57:54] Leah yellow your custom are either Leah
[1:58:02] represent richer represented your law
[1:58:06] your custom are you there so the Sun
[1:58:12] here graves Jacob grace there are
[1:58:15] further dispensation of the law the law
[1:58:17] with lecher
[1:58:18] you cannot take lecture without passing
[1:58:20] by the law by the custom of the length
[1:58:23] you must take the older first before you
[1:58:26] get richer you pass it to the law either
[1:58:31] then twelve a person and twelve
[1:58:35] patriarch 12 plus 12 24 elders
[1:58:45] I'm letting the sink that's why in
[1:58:48] Revelation 21 verse 9 and 14 you will
[1:58:52] see that in the New Jerusalem they are
[1:58:55] the name of the 12 apostel and 12
[1:58:59] patriarch we don't know if this
[1:59:06] represents this what about our Eagle
[1:59:11] update we found out that Jacob has 12
[1:59:17] star and we found out that Aquila have
[1:59:21] 12 star so what is the ego meaning
[1:59:25] brother branham help me up you still in
[1:59:30] tune in the message the Messiah let me
[1:59:34] drop down here I like to watch the big
[1:59:37] ego make sure you get your seat belt you
[1:59:42] know that father ego you know God call
[1:59:45] himself lingo I'm going slowly did you
[1:59:50] know that he call his prophet he goes
[1:59:53] she were hidden he told that let me job
[1:59:58] now we found out he calls himself ego
[2:00:02] too so he is Jehovah ego and then he's
[2:00:07] got a bunch of eaglets
[2:00:09] eaglets like Messiah Inglot I'm trying
[2:00:14] to get to the ego with curved star we
[2:00:16] already know that Jacob has 12 son idea
[2:00:20] remember God is amigo he called himself
[2:00:24] a word and ego and he called Jacob what
[2:00:32] idea he called Jacob amigo so Jacob is
[2:00:39] illegal and we found the constellation
[2:00:42] of amigo with 12 star just like Jacob
[2:00:47] amigo with 12 patriarch
[2:00:54] are you there you are Queen er
[2:00:56] constellation who was speaking about
[2:00:58] Jacob are you there with 12 star but one
[2:01:06] of the stock is brother than any star it
[2:01:09] is called
[2:01:10] altar now when you look at the 12 tribes
[2:01:14] when the trans tribe were camping into
[2:01:18] the desert the tabernacle was right in
[2:01:21] the middle with three part and there
[2:01:23] were three tribes on the North three
[2:01:26] tribes on the Sarna is three tribe on
[2:01:30] the west and three tribes over there and
[2:01:33] again on the east the burner was the
[2:01:37] banner of Lyon which is your anointing
[2:01:41] on the first two changes on the south
[2:01:44] the burner was the banner of men on the
[2:01:49] east he was the banner of an ox and on
[2:01:52] the top he was the man of Niger and that
[2:01:56] the Inca was represented by the tribe of
[2:01:59] Dan let's go back day
[2:02:07] Revelation chapter 4
[2:02:08] oh my what what Dan was he was here
[2:02:14] that's why he was here somebody been
[2:02:18] reading the Bible he was a ego Ruben was
[2:02:21] the man he was the first one the weakest
[2:02:24] one of the bunch because he wanted to
[2:02:27] his father's concubine and live with his
[2:02:31] father concubine see that's the immoral
[2:02:33] of human being the animal don't have
[2:02:35] done them more amorous they lie on none
[2:02:38] of these things but the man does run
[2:02:41] with the next men wife and so forth he
[2:02:43] was Valbuena was explaining the
[2:02:45] anointing that was a Mingo and Reuben
[2:02:49] was the main face in frame and not that
[2:02:52] there is the way they camped in a bubble
[2:02:55] he said Anne is the head of the three
[2:02:57] tribe
[2:02:58] Judah is the head of the tree tribe
[2:03:00] Reuben is the head of the three tribe a
[2:03:02] frame is the head of the tree trap three
[2:03:04] force is
[2:03:06] 12-12-12 of what israel each one with
[2:03:09] their banner the burglar was Judah was
[2:03:13] the lion the banner of Reuben man the
[2:03:15] banner of the frame of the banner of Dan
[2:03:18] was a legal now when you look at the
[2:03:23] word altar it meant a flying eagle the
[2:03:32] brightest star of the constellation of
[2:03:35] ego was altar an altar is interpreted a
[2:03:40] flying eagle in the book of Revelation
[2:03:43] there is four beasts there is a lion
[2:03:46] there is the odds there is demand and a
[2:03:49] flying eagle which was speaking about
[2:03:52] the ministry of brother Branham right in
[2:03:56] your zodiac right in your zodiac brother
[2:04:03] branham that was his ministry what about
[2:04:07] his birth three stars like Mars Jupiter
[2:04:12] of Venice
[2:04:13] she said they crossed their paths this
[2:04:16] is the woman explaining word one and
[2:04:18] come together there were three wise men
[2:04:21] that come to meet the Lord Jesus and one
[2:04:24] was from the lineage of him and one sham
[2:04:26] and the other just a watch this now when
[2:04:30] they meant together a Bethlehem the
[2:04:32] three star there they form in another
[2:04:34] code but Abraham stated from one are you
[2:04:37] there
[2:04:38] every person on earth I am getting now
[2:04:41] down every person of nerve see they have
[2:04:45] something to do with the star please
[2:04:49] allow me to go to the end we cannot
[2:04:53] postpone this
[2:04:54] I didn't say ask the seller there when
[2:04:58] the moon goes out and the heavenly
[2:05:00] planet goes out they tied it doesn't go
[2:05:03] with it or coming in other word tell
[2:05:05] them the zodiac is influencing the
[2:05:08] movement of the earth that's what it
[2:05:10] means there and say well your birth the
[2:05:14] birth of brother branham not only is
[2:05:16] alter speaking about the middle
[2:05:18] three of brother branham as a flying ego
[2:05:21] for the anthem but the birth of brother
[2:05:24] branham has something to do with the
[2:05:27] star up there all right
[2:05:33] this is stake those twisters weren't
[2:05:40] together and meant the one star the hang
[2:05:45] of the crust and they say then why they
[2:05:50] separated they never went to their orbit
[2:05:54] they'd never been since so they
[2:05:57] explained rather Branum that before
[2:05:59] Jesus Christ was born twisters line up
[2:06:02] when the twister line up because before
[2:06:07] God does anything on earth before God
[2:06:10] bring Benjamin on the earth he first
[2:06:13] served to declare Benjamin in the zodia
[2:06:15] either so before Christ was born three
[2:06:19] stars line up when the lineup Christ was
[2:06:23] born where and the Aries in April and
[2:06:26] what class was born those three stars
[2:06:30] separated again
[2:06:31] are you there but the woman continues he
[2:06:35] says now all the stargazer in the
[2:06:39] country could never see such as that and
[2:06:41] they never notice it he was just
[2:06:44] supernaturally given and on talking like
[2:06:46] that with all of her staff
[2:06:49] well I could not understand what she was
[2:06:51] talking and she said that woman in a
[2:06:55] common narration in commemoration of the
[2:07:00] greatest gift that God ever give to the
[2:07:04] earth he said that something lesser
[2:07:08] brother branham is not God something
[2:07:13] lesser in commemoration of that time so
[2:07:17] when brother Branham want to be born
[2:07:20] those three stars line up again when
[2:07:23] climb up brother Branham is born as a
[2:07:26] lesser why the three star
[2:07:31] of question have to line up at the
[2:07:35] breath of brother branham we have to
[2:07:40] arrests of people if you need the
[2:07:43] scripture see me I'm going to show you
[2:07:46] that in the Bible then I'll take you to
[2:07:48] the message the Bible says that there
[2:07:52] are twists I have that in the Bible you
[2:07:54] need a Bible verse for that I will show
[2:07:56] you the three races we have the jente we
[2:08:00] have the Jews and we have the Samaritan
[2:08:04] brother Branham says Samaritan laws have
[2:08:06] two Jews half Jetta if you need to see
[2:08:09] that in the scripture I can sit with you
[2:08:11] and show you how the nation of Samaria
[2:08:13] come because when Israel was taking to
[2:08:16] captivity the Babylonian brought people
[2:08:18] in there in Israel when the people
[2:08:21] didn't know how to worship God God begin
[2:08:23] to send them lion to kill them then
[2:08:26] they'd ask for the priest that went to
[2:08:28] captivity to come back when they come
[2:08:31] back they begin to enter Mary that where
[2:08:33] they create the nation of Samaria at
[2:08:36] this American are you there when Jesus
[2:08:39] Christ came down he have to unfold the
[2:08:42] Ministry of the Son of Man to all
[2:08:45] clinicians for some reason when Christ
[2:08:49] came Christ are found that to the Jews
[2:08:52] the son of the Messiah he afforded to
[2:08:55] the Peter Peter barcelona's you are the
[2:08:58] son of Jonah and so forth when he met
[2:09:01] the woman of Samaria because he said I
[2:09:03] must need to go there is something
[2:09:06] important I must deliver in samaya
[2:09:08] before my death I'm going to Jerusalem
[2:09:10] to die but I need to do something is
[2:09:12] among when he did it he unfolded the
[2:09:15] same ministry to this about it but he
[2:09:17] never told it to the Delta
[2:09:19] he was a ministry thou should have been
[2:09:23] done by Jesus Christ himself
[2:09:26] but when Christ died and he rose again
[2:09:30] the body of Jesus Christ was taken and
[2:09:33] placed to the throne in heaven now the
[2:09:36] gentle never seen the Sun now God have
[2:09:41] to look for the another body
[2:09:44] to express himself if God goes back and
[2:09:48] pick up the body of Jesus Christ and
[2:09:51] come to the earth the rapture take place
[2:09:54] so God leaves the body of Jesus Christ
[2:09:57] and God needed somebody else
[2:10:01] that's why brother Branham say he is
[2:10:04] borrowing my body the body of brother
[2:10:09] Branham is not the body of God you don't
[2:10:13] borrow something that belongs to you the
[2:10:16] body of God is the body of Jesus Christ
[2:10:20] but because this ministry have to be
[2:10:23] expressed
[2:10:24] God helped to borrow someone according
[2:10:28] to Genesis 18
[2:10:30] that's why brother Branham said in
[2:10:32] Genesis 18 that man was not Jesus Christ
[2:10:36] but when I'm saying notice Jesus was not
[2:10:39] born today he was a tap to show you that
[2:10:42] in this end time God will choose
[2:10:45] somebody that's why brother Branham
[2:10:47] awaited turn his head like this he said
[2:10:49] remember Genesis 18 brother Branham was
[2:10:53] not telling you remember Jesus Christ no
[2:10:56] he was pointing to a body that was not
[2:10:59] the body of God
[2:11:00] remember Genesis 18 are you de and give
[2:11:07] the Messiah son to the genta that's why
[2:11:10] through a lineup came up another tree
[2:11:14] lineup came up but what came up is
[2:11:17] lesser either so because God must use
[2:11:22] brother Branham because of the atonement
[2:11:24] of Calvary because cancer will open up a
[2:11:27] way for God to enter into men are you
[2:11:30] there and if you notice brother of it
[2:11:33] the men of Genesis 18 was not a baby
[2:11:37] swallow that God created a man that was
[2:11:42] an adult either he was not an teenager
[2:11:48] that's why when the pillar of fire came
[2:11:51] he could not use brother Branham
[2:11:55] he was just telling his
[2:11:58] don't drink don't smoke because I have
[2:12:02] work to do
[2:12:04] when you grow all day when you mix when
[2:12:08] you match the picture of Genesis 18 it
[2:12:12] was not a baby me and you
[2:12:15] God can let us go to the nightclub and
[2:12:18] drink and come and preach the gospel
[2:12:21] when we are converted but not rather
[2:12:23] Branum brother Branham II even though
[2:12:27] the desire was there to drink the pillar
[2:12:30] of fire stop it because it's a different
[2:12:34] ministry you cannot destroy your body
[2:12:38] you cannot play with women you cannot
[2:12:40] play with alcohol you are born under an
[2:12:43] answer right Val and I'm just waiting
[2:12:45] for the time to grow when I check
[2:12:48] Genesis 18 I check you I say this is the
[2:12:51] time now let's go man defense the son of
[2:12:54] the Messiah but you must be able to
[2:12:56] separate the truth we are not worshiping
[2:12:59] brother Branham we are worshiping Jesus
[2:13:02] Christ but put by the brother in his
[2:13:04] place
[2:13:07] please let me finish this sermon
[2:13:10] hallelujah in the very day you got a
[2:13:17] brother mark the slide over there I want
[2:13:22] them to see that we in the very day that
[2:13:25] the Son of Man is what revelation
[2:13:29] 10:1 to reign it when you get home the
[2:13:34] servant
[2:13:35] angel message opening up the sir what is
[2:13:39] it I want spoken word developer to get
[2:13:42] this shocking pretty good because
[2:13:45] sometimes we accused of things that are
[2:13:47] not true in our worshiping brother
[2:13:49] branham we are worshiping Jesus qua
[2:13:51] spoken word get this very good what is
[2:13:55] it not the angel is the son of man are
[2:14:01] you there
[2:14:01] but the messenger brother branham oh
[2:14:04] he's revealing the Son of Man Jesus
[2:14:08] Christ can you get it separate
[2:14:11] now that is where he seems to be so hard
[2:14:16] for you you see not the son of man
[2:14:21] himself but this central angel William
[2:14:25] Allen Branham the seventh messenger
[2:14:28] William Allen Branham it is revealing to
[2:14:31] the public the son of lead attorney my
[2:14:34] head is not William Allen Branham it is
[2:14:37] a revelation of the son of length
[2:14:40] through the Messiah sod you must be able
[2:14:46] to separate the two brother branham
[2:14:50] birth ministry zodia alter his birth
[2:14:54] they star and we told you last time that
[2:14:57] brother Branham say the fourth bubble

[2:21:17] star then we found that in Revelation
[2:21:20] there were other stars also besides the
[2:21:24] 12 which is the 12 apostel there are
[2:21:27] other stars that they dragon Judah to

[2:22:16] head and the moon under her feet and the
[2:22:18] red dragon stood to devour the child as
[2:22:20] soon as he was born he took his tail and
[2:22:22] pulled the third part of the stars of
[2:22:24] heaven and cast them to the earth
[2:22:27] brother branham help us up now did you

[2:22:39] talking about the life we thought we
[2:22:41] talked about it last week and pull a
[2:22:43] third part of those stars you clear now
[2:22:46] those stars were Abraham's see Joseph
[2:22:55] only mentioned the patriarch are you
[2:22:59] there
[2:23:00] Abraham Joseph only mentioned the
[2:23:04] patriarchy but Abraham was shown the
[2:23:07] whole foods version they said number
[2:23:09] them I cannot number too much
[2:23:11] now Abraham say Oh God told Abraham look

[2:23:18] you can he say I can't do it he's saying
[2:23:20] neither will you able to number your see
[2:23:23] they're stars brother Dean I am
[2:23:27] launching deep question an answer who is
[2:23:32] the bright and Morning Star we back in
[2:23:37] the Bible Jesus of Nazareth they're
[2:23:40] brothers that ever lived in human flesh
[2:23:43] higher than brother brother we already
[2:23:46] talked about it
[2:23:47] he is the bright and Morning Star he is
[2:23:51] the seed singular of Abraham coming
[2:23:55] through Isaac and we being dead in
[2:23:58] Christ take on Abraham's seed and our
[2:24:00] hair according to the Prophet here he
[2:24:04] comes
[2:24:05] so the stars of heaven represented the
[2:24:12] spirits of men here either deranged drug
[2:24:17] on Rome under its persecution hugging a
[2:24:20] turd of star and cast them down that was
[2:24:24] and the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus
[2:24:27] when they rejected him and cast him and
[2:24:32] had nothing to do with him there was the
[2:24:35] third part of the angelic star so before
[2:24:40] the Jews who rejected Jesus Christ on
[2:24:43] earth physically only heaven are either
[2:24:48] the zodiac their spirit already rejected
[2:24:52] Christ in the zodiac I'm going slowly we
[2:24:57] are in drip water so the plane is moving
[2:25:02] a little bit so they captain Jesus

[2:27:49] us have something to do with a star in
[2:27:53] heaven in the zodiac I'm dropping again
[2:27:57] deeper further what I'm saying there
[2:28:00] little deeper they dig deeper those star
[2:28:03] don't look don't look over about two
[2:28:07] inches apart they are farther away from

[2:28:11] closer they are far away that's what he
[2:28:13] means and I said in all this great vast
[2:28:17] system he's talking about the sodium and
[2:28:19] yet they tell us that they looked
[2:28:21] through glasses can see hundred and
[2:28:23] twenty million years of life way up in
[2:28:25] there they're still moons and stars and
[2:28:27] as an and yet God made every one of them
[2:28:32] and he said in the midst of him remember
[2:28:38] Benjamin was sitting there in the zodiac

[2:32:19] billion and billion he tells the number
[2:32:24] of the star he who's he again the Lord
[2:32:28] he calls them all by their name so each
[2:32:38] star in the zodiac has a name who know
[2:32:44] the name we don't know the name it is
[2:32:48] God who knows the name and it's good
[2:32:52] only the who can call the star either
[2:32:57] you have a representation in the zodiac
[2:33:02] bubble the Lamb's Book of Life you have
[2:33:11] a representation in the written bubble
[2:33:16] the Lamb's Book of Life

[2:33:24] zodiac the star offices of heaven there
[2:33:29] is one star that is connected to your
[2:33:32] life let destiny and a star have a name
[2:33:43] the book of life contains name name

[2:33:50] foundation of the day so the braga
[2:33:53] contain name the zodiac continue name
[2:33:57] but no one can call
[2:33:59] except God are you there so when your
[2:34:07] time is come up where's your tongue 11
[2:34:13] something will be declared in the zodiac
[2:34:18] you hear people in the world say he
[2:34:21] studies brighter

[2:34:31] area when it's time for your birth when
[2:34:38] it's time for your new birth God will
[2:34:42] declare your brand in heaven God will
[2:34:45] call your name and when your star

[2:35:09] how am I going to know master is
[2:35:12] vibrating this is deep water this is
[2:35:19] deep water my brother
[2:35:21] now watch the alleged search you believe
[2:35:25] in election sure I will never put in the
[2:35:28] Lamb's Book of Life
[2:35:30] before the foundation of the world we
[2:35:32] was selected by God by his foreknowledge
[2:35:35] he elected us you ought to be thankful
[2:35:39] to God that he was elected that is what
[2:35:45] I'm so thankful about that's God for me
[2:35:49] he caused his start by the name okay
[2:35:54] charge me I never chose him he chosen
[2:35:59] because remember Jude told us that they
[2:36:03] are also wandering stars go check the
[2:36:07] book of Jude that were predestinated for
[2:36:11] condemnation they are
[2:36:13] also in the zodiac because in the book
[2:36:17] of life they are named also they have to
[2:36:19] be he weighs like Judah those name that
[2:36:23] was taken of the book of life the zodiac
[2:36:26] also have wandering stars are we clear
[2:36:31] I hope I didn't join you brother denied
[2:36:35] okay no man can come to me
[2:36:38] you only take God accept my father chose
[2:36:41] him first all the father has given me
[2:36:44] welcome to me if he calls you we are
[2:36:48] talking about happy reckoner if he calls
[2:36:51] you he would not get your dog that's the
[2:36:55] time for you to come now brother Stephen
[2:36:58] how am I gonna know God is not in your
[2:37:01] mother I'm going slowly I told you
[2:37:06] injured in deep water if you were in the
[2:37:11] full knowledge of God then you are
[2:37:14] becoming a part of God and the only way
[2:37:18] you can be a son of God or daughter of
[2:37:21] God you had to be part of God and God is
[2:37:25] not complete without you has to be
[2:37:28] that's right because there is one only
[2:37:32] one resource of life and that is God and
[2:37:34] him alone has eternal life you are a
[2:37:37] part of him in so much that you are an
[2:37:41] attribute because remember in living
[2:37:45] world when apply explain to you that we
[2:37:47] were touched in the man of God and those
[2:37:49] thought was first expressing their
[2:37:52] zodiac by putting your stars then God
[2:37:55] expressed them in the pyramid then in
[2:37:58] the written word today okay Oh in his
[2:38:03] thinking in the beginning and that
[2:38:05] because he thought of you in the
[2:38:08] beginning he gives that letter tag I'm
[2:38:13] going slowly
[2:38:15] he gives deluder tab towards me to told
[2:38:19] him that is what has to be quicken so
[2:38:24] there is when you are born
[2:38:26] your heart is designed with Otago I'm
[2:38:30] going slowly okay
[2:38:33] and that dad is something that God will
[2:38:36] quicken to pull you toward him
[2:38:39] we trying to know because what Adam said
[2:38:41] when he's looking he's going to look at
[2:38:43] you but how is he looking

[2:39:10] this condemnation predestination that
[2:39:13] turns the grace of God into
[2:39:14] lasciviousness correctly for a den of
[2:39:17] all to this condemnation God for a den
[2:39:20] it like Pharaoh giudice carry out that
[2:39:22] many of them if you look in that book
[2:39:24] you say wandering stars stars in heaven
[2:39:27] by those name will be raised from the
[2:39:30] book of life you don't on God's
[2:39:33] property if God gives you a what a tub
[2:39:38] I'm trying to explain you you need to
[2:39:41] understand how God call
[2:39:44] that's why brother Branham say work on
[2:39:46] the procession are you there

[2:40:12] brother Branham is saying if you feel
[2:40:14] when they're preaching the gospel and
[2:40:16] something is vibrating in you be blessed
[2:40:23] to know that God gives you greater
[2:40:27] Branham is interpreting the dog he's
[2:40:31] interpreting the time God gives you the
[2:40:34] Prince Regent
[2:40:36] a dagger in your heart is the
[2:40:38] Princeville edge God calling you to come
[2:40:42] into his kingdom and not at your door
[2:40:45] heart and search you you might be one of
[2:40:49] them out there
[2:40:50] that is on the outside of the kingdom in
[2:40:53] other world you could be another Judah
[2:40:55] another fair but if when they preach the
[2:40:58] gospel something's vibrating to you your
[2:41:02] star is blanking but it's given future
[2:41:08] home are you there where the bottom is
[2:41:12] calling people to pray say remember me

[2:41:38] because at the at the standing of the
[2:41:41] seven angel all the mystery tingling at
[2:41:45] your heart that is what it is it is that
[2:41:51] attribute trying to declare itself when
[2:41:57] they are preaching something begin to
[2:41:59] burn brother Branham say that burning it
[2:42:02] is the attribute of God that is wanting
[2:42:05] to birth itself into you he starts from
[2:42:11] your star are you there
[2:42:13] nothing will be saved only those name
[2:42:17] who were put on the Lamb's Book of Life
[2:42:19] before the foundation of the world their
[2:42:22] book brother Branham is explaining the
[2:42:24] Bible
[2:42:25] remember the zodiac is also the Bible
[2:42:27] written by stars and those stars
[2:42:29] containing and the Bible is a Bible
[2:42:32] written by letters and those letter
[2:42:35] contain your name but how is the name
[2:42:38] written the book hold the mystery and
[2:42:44] the book is only unfolding it now
[2:42:49] each one's name but what the mystery of
[2:42:53] the book is while it's calling those
[2:42:57] name what are you saying what is Stephen
[2:42:59] brother branham can you break it down
[2:43:01] please their book does not say now
[2:43:05] reveal mica Demi you won't see that in
[2:43:09] the Bible yet brother Michael is in the
[2:43:12] Bible you won't see your name in the
[2:43:15] email in the star yet your name is in a
[2:43:18] star
[2:43:19] it's a mystery that God hope he say now
[2:43:23] Lavelle is to be safe in the term of the
[2:43:26] church ages or all my neighbor
[2:43:28] whoever no it doesn't say that it just
[2:43:32] shows the mystery
[2:43:34] I thought the mystery of what the thing
[2:43:39] is but we ourselves by faith revelation
[2:43:45] because that tag is tingling something
[2:43:48] in you will be inferred to yourself
[2:43:52] individually and you believe we're going
[2:43:57] to get to the opportunity not overcome
[2:44:01] we are given what a white stone it's in
[2:44:06] the Bible I'm trying to save them now a
[2:44:08] new name I will give him a white stone
[2:44:12] and in that word stone there is a new
[2:44:16] name that no one knows that what the
[2:44:19] Bible say except the one delivered
[2:44:23] it's a personal revelation don't make
[2:44:30] any difference what people say you know
[2:44:33] yourself when you have been brought into
[2:44:36] the interval you don't need nobody to
[2:44:38] explanatory no one could tell you any
[2:44:42] difference not because you don't change
[2:44:44] because you did this or that but
[2:44:46] something just tells you you got a stone
[2:44:51] that is in there it's a revelation that
[2:44:57] was tingling a tag those are folding the
[2:45:02] attribute of
[2:45:05] are you there
[2:45:07] not hard stone because God promised a
[2:45:11] heart of flesh a soft one okay this
[2:45:16] stone make your heart soft instead of
[2:45:20] hard oh but it's even get it here will
[2:45:26] name be confessed before the Father in
[2:45:29] heaven let me go to him now I have been
[2:45:32] told by those who know that they Swedish
[2:45:36] sound to a human hear is the sound of
[2:45:41] that person's so when they are preaching
[2:45:46] the gospel and you feel something sweet
[2:45:50] something tingling something vibrating
[2:45:54] you are just hearing your name how
[2:46:02] people love to have their name before
[2:46:04] the public how they love a claim but no
[2:46:08] earthly voice will ever send your name
[2:46:11] as sweetly as with the voice of who it
[2:46:16] is God calling the name of the stars are
[2:46:19] you there if God's name in is in the
[2:46:23] book of life and we meant there to be
[2:46:25] revealed before the holy angel what a
[2:46:28] day that will be when we hear Jesus say
[2:46:31] father they confess my name before men
[2:46:34] in the days of the earthly pilgrimage
[2:46:36] now I will confess their name before
[2:46:39] thee and the Holy Angel now let's get
[2:46:41] down we can finish it up now what they
[2:46:46] star do star give a lesser light is that
[2:46:50] right well what does a star shine phone

[2:46:56] great bright star yonder shun but when
[2:46:59] I'm saying if he goes outside he look at
[2:47:01] the star and he asked this very question
[2:47:03] I say little star you sure are beautiful
[2:47:06] what makes you shine like that
[2:47:09] well if he could talk he would say
[2:47:13] brother Branham I am NOT shining
[2:47:17] either well what's make you shun it is
[2:47:22] something shining on me see it is the
[2:47:26] sun shining on me brother branham in
[2:47:30] other word it is Christ shining on me
[2:47:33] are you gay brother brother I just

[2:47:51] people pathway well the true pastor in
[2:47:56] the pulpit if he is anointed of God it
[2:48:00] is not the pastor shining it is not him
[2:48:04] a good preacher it's not him a good
[2:48:07] pastor it's the Holy Spirit shining on
[2:48:10] him giving the gospel light praise God
[2:48:16] let's go to current and 15 and then we
[2:48:19] finish with della scripture you might
[2:48:29] have to review this sermon over you
[2:48:33] there first Corinthians chapter 15 if
[2:48:36] you dare you can say Amen verse 41
[2:48:40] brother of it are they okay there is one
[2:48:47] glory of the Sun everybody Simba and
[2:48:51] another glory of the Moon and another
[2:48:55] glory of the stars for one star Dhafir
[2:49:03] from another star in glory
[2:49:08] the sun has it glow the moon has its
[2:49:14] glory stars children of God have their
[2:49:19] glory but Paul is saying that once is
[2:49:24] different than another star in glory
[2:49:29] spoken word Tabernacle spoke jealousy
[2:49:36] stop backbiting accept one another the
[2:49:43] way God made us to be one star is
[2:49:49] different than another star in glory if
[2:49:55] brother Johnson's good acknowledge that
[2:49:58] accepted if brother Abel sing good
[2:50:02] acknowledge that accepted enjoy if
[2:50:05] brother Mikey Holloway is preaching
[2:50:08] acknowledge that accepted brother Steven
[2:50:12] is preaching acknowledge that accepted
[2:50:14] don't fight one another because you are
[2:50:19] not fighting the man you are fighting
[2:50:22] God who made darling the way here is
[2:50:28] every sister cook but they cook except
[2:50:35] the other sister the way she cooks don't
[2:50:39] fight her
[2:50:41] go criticize her don't backbiter accept
[2:50:45] one another the way God made you why
[2:50:48] Paul say because one star is different
[2:50:53] than another star in me when Fighting's
[2:50:57] muddy Wendy Channing we were fighting
[2:51:00] God himself
[2:51:02] that's why when Paul met the pillar of
[2:51:05] fire the pillar of fire never third pole
[2:51:07] you thought leader you thought so and so
[2:51:11] he said why are you persecuting me I am
[2:51:15] the one who made them out the way they
[2:51:18] are team leave brother Brian to express
[2:51:23] to his face let's run around play the
[2:51:26] planner because one star is different
[2:51:29] than another star there is something
[2:51:32] about Brian when he touch the instrument
[2:51:34] he can help the something about brother
[2:51:37] David
[2:51:38] he knows what to do with the
[2:51:39] computer recognize one another one-stop
[2:51:42] divert from one-stop his glory you're a
[2:51:49] teacher I'm a teacher still we might be
[2:51:53] teaching differently acknowledge one
[2:51:56] another the first thing I went to that
[2:52:04] person and found their birthplace I
[2:52:07] would deal with this in the new birth
[2:52:09] when we will begin to study the new
[2:52:12] birth I went to that person and find
[2:52:15] their place their birthplace when
[2:52:17] brother Branham was talking to the
[2:52:19] person he will ask you where were you
[2:52:21] going
[2:52:21] and what sign your zodiac what sign that
[2:52:28] you were born under and could tell what
[2:52:35] their birth was but when a minute
[2:52:38] element where were you born under which
[2:52:42] zodiac sign
[2:52:43] I don't preach this so you go to the
[2:52:45] horoscope in the website and trying to
[2:52:47] look at those messed up stuff are you
[2:52:50] there whatever Adam say he would take a
[2:52:53] look Oh Brian you were born in America
[2:52:55] okay under which sign brother branham
[2:52:58] poodle once brother branham combining
[2:53:01] those two elements he said I could tell
[2:53:04] what their birth was it's a whole
[2:53:07] mystery is they which way is sex in
[2:53:12] their nature nature sets them in a
[2:53:17] certain line you are behaving a certain
[2:53:20] way because of different element are you
[2:53:26] there
[2:53:27] then when they are reborn I'm going
[2:53:32] slowly in other words when you come to
[2:53:34] nature you have the place you aboard
[2:53:38] place of birth you have the zodiac in
[2:53:46] the zodiac we just saw that there is a
[2:53:48] star also there representing you
[2:53:51] are you there and then you have gene
[2:53:54] from your parent that's why I say I want
[2:53:58] to deal with this separately and I'm
[2:54:00] going to show you the gene from your
[2:54:01] mother the gene from your father how
[2:54:04] these things come up are you there and
[2:54:06] then brother branham say these stuff
[2:54:09] right here
[2:54:10] gene from Mama gene from Papa zodiac
[2:54:14] imprinting a software into you because
[2:54:17] people born under a certain Sun
[2:54:19] sometimes had to behave a certain way
[2:54:22] because the zodia complete a certain
[2:54:26] character are you there
[2:54:27] then they bred for place when you grow
[2:54:30] up in America brother branham say every
[2:54:32] country have a spirit that's period
[2:54:36] imprint on you are you there
[2:54:39] so once you get a mix up like this
[2:54:42] you're already in a mess because this
[2:54:47] will set your natural life is certainly
[2:54:51] if you look at brother Branham who his
[2:54:54] father was Irish
[2:55:00] but his grandma was Indian burn
[2:55:08] originally they were I wish I wish I
[2:55:10] wish I wish I wish and before brother
[2:55:13] Branham was born God bring took his
[2:55:16] grandfather to Texas you need a coach
[2:55:19] see me when he went to Texas he was
[2:55:22] looking he saw an Indian he said like
[2:55:25] that woman she looked good he said man
[2:55:27] you Irish what are you doing with an
[2:55:29] Indian woman say no I need to marry the
[2:55:32] woman took the woman marry her brother
[2:55:35] branham said there was were to break
[2:55:38] that ouch line bloodline he introduced
[2:55:42] an Indian but when he introduced the
[2:55:46] Indian blood brother branham is born
[2:55:51] what is in the Irish that God was
[2:55:55] rooting what is in India that God has to
[2:56:00] introduce an Indian blood because
[2:56:04] the anointing of brother branham
[2:56:06] assaulter is Elijah the prophet Elijah
[2:56:13] was a man that is always in the bush and
[2:56:19] Irish don't have it I wish every
[2:56:24] character that brother branham unfolded
[2:56:27] that character in heaven I'm not going
[2:56:29] to say it today either
[2:56:32] then God bring Indian to mix that nature
[2:56:37] of Elijah and brother branham
[2:56:42] automatically loves to go into the wood
[2:56:45] because the lunch must be reflected and
[2:56:50] in division after are
[2:56:52] destroyed once more brother Branham was
[2:56:55] wearing what in Indian an Indian chief
[2:57:04] go check could let me go back to what
[2:57:08] I'm doing I let you in a suspense on
[2:57:11] that one handle it later when they are
[2:57:17] we born they are over here in another
[2:57:20] nature you found out in this nature
[2:57:23] that's the inside remember the first
[2:57:25] conscious of the servant conscience
[2:57:26] there in the inside conscience the outer
[2:57:29] side conscious move you in one way that
[2:57:32] is your natural birth
[2:57:34] so these son gives you a certain way
[2:57:37] that's why when Jesus come here look and
[2:57:39] economy see sir you must be born again
[2:57:42] because rebirth is the only thing that
[2:57:45] can clean up this stuff but the
[2:57:48] conversion don't take good stuff away I
[2:57:52] have cooked
[2:57:54] that's why brother branham made a
[2:57:57] statement like my conversion didn't take
[2:58:00] this off if you are an African you get
[2:58:03] the Holy Ghost
[2:58:04] you will still eat fufu if you are
[2:58:11] American you ate your hamburger you get
[2:58:13] the Holy Ghost you will still eat
[2:58:14] hamburger
[2:58:16] it's not gonna change you they're only
[2:58:18] girls only we'll take away B and Tech's
[2:58:21] walking away but he will live whatever
