thank you Jesus y'all might be seated a minute we do have quite a bit and we do have three specials this morning amen so we want to try to make sure we give our pastor time as well amen praise the Lord so we enjoyed a little bit of Fellowship yesterday working over here emptying the trailer out I want to give praise God for that because it's always good to work well with the brothers amen amen um sister a coach is approving daily amen praise the Lord amen so let's give the Lord a clap awesome for her It's Already Done amen now we neglected to mention um brother Seth had a birthday with him what was it a week it's been about a week now he's trying to sneak under the radar but sister guilty Beth had one I believe it was yesterday or two days ago right so let's give a clap offering to our to our family members to celebrate it another birthday amen praise the Lord now last Wednesday the devil was trying to attack one of our little brothers brother Elijah okay he was getting in his trying to get on his body and stuff and uh sister Kayla says it was happening right here and um then in the car on Thursday also and Elijah to quote said Mom the devil has no control over my body because I'm a son of God and he began to sing praises Amen to God and the coffin stopped amen praise the Lord amen glory to God so I have a couple of um prayer requests and then um Brother Sam has a spoken prayer request and I'll just ask you to pray over these other ones Brother Sam so let me read this because brother Lamont sent this to me you know last last Sunday I believe it was all the way last Sunday he was having some back pain and uh so he sent me a text this morning and he said uh he said God bless you he said please continue to keep me in prayer my lower back pain is gone but now the pain is on my right hip to lower right leg and my right foot my wife and I call that a move in pain because it's always moving somewhere else you know but it's a lie it's a lion vanity so let's remember brother Lamont amen we want to continue to remember sister coats as well amen um brother Charles the middle Charles amen he he there's going to be I guess it's going to be a decision made this week concerning his job and a new position that will allow him to be here on Wednesdays so that's why he wants everybody to pray about it amen you know that says they're sitting down about the particulars and that's the main one for him that that they let him they tell him that they're going to let him be here on a on a Wednesday hey man that's important I had my schedule by the glory of God redone so we could be here as well so let's remember that and then last but not least um before we bring Brother Sam up yesterday as we were cleaning this trailer this old trailer out the man was supposed to come and pick it up but there was some question about the condition of the trailer and how far it would make it off the property so that's a concern so we're wanting to bring up before the church to pray for a feasible solution God bless you my brother good to see you sister a feasible solution to the removal of this old trailer because not you know we don't need it anymore and it is an eyesore and you know it's probably got dry rotted Airlines and dry rotted tires and no tail lights and other things that will keep it unsafe if it were to leave the property and I think they're afraid that once it leaves the property it's theirs and they'll be responsible for it which you know I would be fearful there's a few of us that have or have had CDLs and we don't think we'd touch it you know so we need it gone though we're we're tossing some ideas around but um just come on up brother Sam just keep that on your prayer list because you know God gave us such a pretty little building didn't he and we've done so much with it and we're thankful because he meets us here every time we open these doors he's here with us and we just want to uh we just want to do our best for him amen so we want to pray about that and see about having it removed amen praise the Lord is everybody happy I hope well I have a little announcement to make first so um I guess you can they remain standing for our wedding the the minister forgot to tell everybody to sit down so the whole time we're at the altar they they remain standing you remember Earl Heist you remember him Earl Heist anyways he was up in Maryland so anyways brother Charles knows the little church up there in Northeast brother Ron Walbert and them and we Fellowship there for several years and God has placed it on my heart and Sister Teresa's heart to return there and that's the announcement that I want to make and uh because it's been kind of a lingering thing and I didn't intentionally mean it to be that way but you know the Bible said the steps of the Lord are ordered the steps of a righteous man are ordered of the Lord and sometimes God doesn't tell us everything right up front so we get one step at a time and we don't even know exactly what we're doing so it's hard to make an announcement and tell everybody what we're doing but if everything works out and it looks like it is we put our house up for sale much more than what it's worth and it's sold uh well we got a contract on either the first or the second buyer we're uh first to the second viewer so it's under contract a real estate agent is saying that doesn't mean that it's sold there's a lot of things that can go upside down between now and the time we actually close on it but because everything that has kind of happened in a lingering way there was some questions among some of the uh people in the fellowship was there something about the election because it was around the time of the election that I I wasn't in church for a while and so people were wondering could it be something to do with the election and I just want to assure you it had nothing to do with the election we Theresa and I both voted unanimously across the board I think we got the best deacons I think we've got the best song leaders we've got the best worship team for sure even though they're not even elected well let me take that back they were elected before the foundation of the world nobody can take that away and then it came up well did somebody say or do something and I just want to assure you nobody no you guys are the best you guys are the absolute best and we love y'all and I I have grown spiritually exponentially here in this assembly underneath this teaching and that was the one question I kept asking myself why why leave why leave I don't know I don't have the answer to that but we just Teresa and I are both feeling definitely led to do that so now because I made this uh a part of the prayer request this is my prayer request pray with us that if this is God's perfect will every door will open and will have a smooth transition and if it's not God's perfect will let every door close uh you know the the appraisal doesn't have to happen right the inspection can go wrong there's so many things they could even they could even just say you know we decided not to do it apparently there's a clause in the contract that up to March the 10th they can just withdraw and there's nothing that we can really say about it so so we've got a lot of options here we're the sons of God we're the daughters of God and God hears our prayers and we're just asking you all to pray with us so so let's pray for first for sister close because she's been very much in my heart I know it's been in all of our hearts and then for brother Charles and for all these other requests let's bow our heads Heavenly Father having made this known now to the church Lord God and it's not an easy thing for sister Teresa and I because we love these folks but Lord Jesus Christ we know that you're going to be here you're going to be with us because you're omnipresent and Lord God your peace will be with your children no matter where they're at even an alliance Den or Lord in a jail cell like Paul and Silas they could still have the joy of the Lord and we have the joy of the Lord in our heart we just ask your blessings now father and Lord God we ask your blessings on our precious sister of course the Lord God that you will will continue to minister in her mind because healing starts in the soul it comes with believing your word and denying every symptoms not looking to the ways and the in the in the torments of Satan but Lord God looking to the precious Promises of God and we pray within her soul lord they'll rise such a faith that there's nothing that Satan Can Do Lord God and Lord Jesus we just pray father that it'll manifest in her physical body Lord God the terrestrial body Lord Lord Jesus Christ we're just looking for that Lord and we're looking for the manifestation and and as the brothers said without a test there's not a testimony and we believe our precious sister will have a wonderful testimony we also want to continue to pray for brother Lamont and that moving ache and pain Lord God as our nervous system works Lord God sometimes it tweaks one way and tweaks another way but Lord you know where it's going to go before it leaves so we just pray that you'll continue to bless brother Lamont Lord Jesus and Lord for the need for the for the trailer Lord God the Father it's old and decrepit and it just needs to find its way out of here so give us a definite resolution to that and it seems like there was another request that I'm I'm not remembering but God knows what it is so may you bless that Lord God bless that need father and Lord Jesus we also want to ask you that you will bless the tithes and the offerings we ask Lord God that you bless those who have and those who have not to give we pray Lord God that you'll bless the minister father Lord let him get himself yourself out of the way give us ears to hear father and may we be attentive Lord as though it were you standing in the Pulpit this morning and not a brother shimbo father Lord God we want to hear everything that you have for our souls Lord God Lord because faith comes by hearing and hearing the word and the one question that you had Lord was would you find faith when you returned and we know if we have a ten of ears Lord and you build that Faith within us then indeed you will find it and you'll find it in our souls so bless the remainder of our worship father as we presented unto you the king of kings and the Lord of lords in Jesus name amen thank you praise the Lord we do want to well I'll leave this for the pastor um we have three specials this morning so let's call let's call my daughter up they're visiting today and I'd like to call her up it's good to see them it's been a little while for us as well brother Zach um but we

is a very dear lamb to him that he's trying to reach okay he's trying the best to reach a dear lamb to him so keep him in prayer if it's the Lord's will to move that direction to reach that lamb let it be done so he can reach that land at any cost the time is almost closing the gentle door is almost finished let's reach out to that Soul that's why he's doing what he's doing everybody okay so far glory to God so our prayer are with you he's still part of this church and we still body and body forever amen glory to God Lord's willing at the end of the service we will have a water baptism for my

he gave me time to go see a family in this church and also to sleep up in the hospital to be able to be with sistako so everything you do in here you're actually giving me more freedom to do what I have to do and to attend to everybody so God richly bless you everybody that was here for the sacrifice to help move or transfer the things from the old trailer to the new one we really really appreciate it God richly bless you amen uh question and answer is coming up on March 18th and the time uh it's already 2 30 but the the place brother Kelly will let me know if the our secret place is already open if it's not open yet so we know we might have to meet again here in church amen amen okay let me start this way how many are up to date with the sermon let me see your hand I can't sleep that one praise be to the name of the Lord how many are reading their Cod book okay how many are reading their Church ages I have a young man who finished the church age completely but I don't want to call it his name because the devil will attack him so I need to protect him amen amen glory to God everything will be okay the reason why I'm asking this I don't know if you notice every time we preach every sermon is building on top of the other have you noticed that so if you miss one or two or five you're gonna find yourself asking question of the things that we already went through amen amen so when I'm asking I'm asking without humility I just want to see where you are and if there is anything I need to do so I know what to do amen but I will encourage you because usually we got three groups of people in the church everybody okay there is a group of people that will listen to the word and they will go home and they will review again the word that the group that will catch many things that you thought you caught in the sermon but the Holy Spirit Will minister to you over again and show you a lot of stuff and establish you more because brother Branham say the holy spirit is the inside teacher everybody okay but there is another group that usually listen to the word and when they leave that's it they're not going to come back if they went to the bathroom or they went on the phone they don't even care about the five minute that they lost they just go and that's it amen and there is another group that doesn't even care amen if they missed five Services 10 Services it doesn't matter they won't go back again and say no I missed the ones the service let me catch up on Wednesday so I can get there amen so my encouragement is for all of you to be in group one be people that go back and review sermon I can give you brother Brandon's sermon you can listen to it and I can give it to you you listen the second time you're going to hear something different it doesn't mean you didn't listen to brother Brown you can read the scripture the Bible I read the Bible the first time I finished it all I went again the second time and every time I'm going back again I keep seeing things new it doesn't mean I didn't read the Bible amen but the holy spirit is so great that always give for Yemen give time to consecrate yourself and go back and review things everybody okay glory be to God Amen I was contacted this is the second time by a minister from uh from overseas from Ghana they had a trouble with the drum in the church it's just trouble amen some people say they should not play drama in a church some say they should play drama in a church and the God is split in the country and some got to the point where if they come to your church and you're playing drums the people will just leave and go out I don't know where people are coming from I don't know where they're getting this stuff this is the second time so I gave him five quotes five of them not one five to load them up correctly so he can handle that situation but our drum here will stay [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay everybody Joshua brother Kelly Brother David brother sister Charlene you will continue to play your drum I have five bullets that I have here and I kept the sixth one just in case of emergency that one will open door to a lot of stuff amen so I don't know where they're getting from my brother online just know there is nothing wrong with this thing if you have any questions shoot me an email I will load you up pretty good amen I have to tell you this thing so when you hear things in the message coming your way you know how to fight it and if you want me to I can take the five coat and put it on the church chat group do you want me to do that okay so brother Robert radical just remind me I will load it to the church so you are vaccinated pretty good everybody okay okay there is all kind of stuff coming up in this message I don't know what's wrong but for some reason it's there but I want you to be aware and to stay out of it amen let's go to our scripture this morning I believe I got everything covered up you will hear some of the strange Doctrine coming up you wonder where did they get it from there is even another one but I won't say it Jeremiah chapter 1. okay praise God if you there you can say amen amen I wanted to move forward from where we stopped last Sunday by the big boss stopped me to open up a different Channel and I'm gonna beg you by the mercies of God please pay attention okay please pay attention the third time please my brother my sister pay attention this is a difficult subject that have caused a lot of misunderstanding in the message and still puzzling preachers I am a nobody but I just want you to pay attention okay if not you can fall into a difficulty and if the Holy Spirit help you catch it this morning you will know really Who You Are and you will see that even when you were a sinner nothing really changed hold up right there okay amen Jeremiah chapter 1 verse 4. you will say nothing really changed your life changed you give your life to Jesus Christ you change but really you nothing changes right actually you become more powerful [Applause] when you were sinner you were already parallel you just didn't know that's why you're here this morning you being here you overcame something you're not here by any chance Jeremiah 1 verse 4. then the word of the Lord came to me saying you see where I'm going before I form you in the belly a water a new day you might be seated so

Jesus Christ you understand this now who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in water Christ so if you want to get your blessings where do you need to go so when you get in

don't know if you get me there is somebody that is born with a gift of speaking in tongue they just born with it but even though you were not born with it if you just get in Christ body Branham said that's why you will see one day you speak in tongue and after a while you don't speak anymore all the happiness you consecrate yourself enough and you pull something out it's a DSS you've had the application and you get in everybody okay everybody good verse 4 according as he has done what chosen Us in Hope him so where did God choose you before are we okay the foundation of the water world that we should be held holy and how Without Blame does he click something does he remind you something you should be holy Without Blame before him in water no so the decision to make you holy where did it start glory to God chapter verse 5 a very tactical word having done water be destinated us everybody okay predestinated us to the water adoption of the children by who Jesus Christ to who

Tabernacle it is interpreted as roof in the holiest roof is resting in preparation for the rewarding roof resting into roof rewarding and rough rewarding Tech roof from one tabernacle into another Tabernacle everybody okay but what is going on with a theophany and a thought or a seed what is going on we okay I told you it's a very difficult things it's a problem in the message so I want you to really pay attention what is the problem what is going on pastor why are we approaching it this way which year is this 57. in 1957 in which matter August in 1957 in August brother Branham make a statement what is the statement brother Branham is making brother Branham say when a man becoming that body he had control over all the water fishes all the water files and the Beast of the word feel and then there was no man to till the water which man is he talking about what is his name thank you he's talking about who I don't know brother Branham is talking about Adam Adam in Genesis 1 26 because that is where God told him that uh uh he give him dominion over the fishes and everything you know that now brother Branham goes in Genesis 2 he say he don't made male and female you know that but there was no man to kill the soul then God made Man Out of the Dust of the what if you know who he's talking about he gives him a hand like a chimpanzee am I reading something different it doesn't mean that we are chimpanzee he looked like if you go see a chimpanzee he looked like a human hand that's what brother brother want to say everybody okay he give him a foot like water it doesn't mean that like our feet is like a bear a bear has a foot with toes with nail we have a foot with toe with nail everybody okay brother Barnum said he gives him he made him on the image and this Earthly body right here natural is in the image of what animal life and it's made out of the same kind of water material your body is made just the same kind of material as a what horse you go to the Book of Genesis the Bible said God made the beast from the dust of the ground it is written in Genesis we already went through that everybody okay it looks like a dog or anything like that it is made out of calcium petroleum Cosmic light everybody okay All Flesh like that is not the same flesh that is First Corinthians 15 39 remember that for those who read it it is a different flesh because Paul said there is a flesh for the fish for the human for the bird and things it's in First Corinthians 15 39. but I'm saying it's a different flesh but it's made out of the Dust of the Earth where we come water from Follow Me Now carefully but brother Branham is comparing men and animal everybody okay he's picking up the human being and the animal he says body wise we all came from the dust of the earth we're coming from the same material yes now brother Branham say butter the difference between anonymous everybody okay God put a song in air man everybody okay that's why the Bible says there were eight Souls thou herself in the days of Noah everybody okay because Noah and his wife too Noah had three children and their wife how many six plus two equal hey everybody okay but they were animals in the ark they were bird in the ark but God said God save what age so in other words when God was going inside the earth when God was checking the ark when he looked at the cheetah no soul he looked at the elephant no so he goes to Noah he say one Noah's wife to him their three wives because animals don't have soul did I lost anybody keep quiet I'm gonna climb more brother Branham say God put a soul in a man and he didn't put it in the water anymore brother Bradham is comparing man we felt not anymore he said because they saw that was in the man is that water the alphaneate [Applause] according to brother Branham in 57 the soul of a man brother Branham called that a water yeah so beautiful that's why I told you to stay put because this have split the message into camper are you okay and those two camp this Camp have big preachers none this Camp also has big preacher no everybody okay and the guy preacher that if he said one thing or the preacher behind him will repeat the same thing nobody will challenge you I am in need the camp [Applause] everybody okay I am nobody I don't know anything but I know the author of this message [Applause] everybody okay what is the problem with this brother Stephen because last Sunday we found out that a theophany is a body amen we have two body we have a natural body and we have a spiritual body and when we come we come from our father in The Natural Body and when we die this is when we enter our water our theophany and the glorified body is the Natural Body plus the water everybody okay so far so how can a body be a soul preach the confusion is not with the message the confusion is in the preachers [Music] and the congregation I was informed that people came up with a crazy devilish I are up where they are showing the contradiction of brother Brown and the person to whom they talk turn around he was actually a sister say the same thing can be done to the Bible I have scripture that I can give you right now this scriptures say David is number eight this one said David is number seven I have a bunch of them like that there is no contradiction in the Bible the contradiction is with us with our small bird brain everybody okay there is no confusion in the message come on if you don't understand something chill out [Applause] just leave it alone let somebody another preacher will come and God will give him the inspiration and he will preach and we will only join [Applause] now we get a cap that says that your family of Adam Adam has his theophany they are right they're reading the court and there is another kept they say no the cap that are saying no where are they coming from why do they say no do they have another Court are we are you following me that is contradicting this one in their brain William Marion brother in 19 water in 1965 let's go slowly my friend I told you I'm trying to save you a big headache in this message because this is the Earth the origin of the big confusion in the baptism of the Holy Spirit and you will see it sooner in 1965 after the opening of this everybody okay in other words the second oil have come up and the second all broke the seals and the World opened up big enough make a statement stop brother Stephen so you want to say that brother Branham after the seals contradict brother Ibraham before the series no so when you put this on your Tick Tock make sure you put also Mano don't cut me off put everything I spoke everybody okay no it was an oil and the other one was an oil but the second one is powerful we already went through that everybody okay what is he saying after the seals William Marion brother he says the difference between him and who you he's talking about Jesus Christ as a water son you are a son Jesus was his son but there is a difference between you and Jesus there is a difference between you and Jesus the difference between you and him as a son he was at the beginning the what word everybody okay more fair body everybody okay he came in and live in that in the person of Hope then later we never heard of who no more Mexican let's go slowly we know that in the beginning there was a spirit everybody okay then the spirit move into the world which is Christos which is melchizede which is the logos which is the pillar of I which is the theophany everybody good and then the word was made this church everybody okay now let's go he says he came in and live in that in the world in the in the person of who what melchized then later on we never heard no more of who milk is selling because he became hope Jesus Christ we already understand this Melchizedek was the priest but he became hope Jesus Christ now you did what bypass that this brother Brown I'm called this the regular line brother Branham say God the way he started firstly he was here then he hear his number one then he moved number one into number two everybody okay the number one move from here and become one and two everybody okay damn number two here moved to number three and he become number one number two a number everybody good everybody good now brother Branham is saying that you me and you we did what brother Branham say me and you instead of going one two we want one three we're missing something here what are we missing here is what we call the logos what we're missing is what we call the tea of honey what we're missing is what we call the crust what we're missing is what we call our Pillar of Fire what we're missing is what we call Melchizedek everybody okay so far what is the other Camp say why are they saying no William me and you we already know that we bypass okay even brother brand I'm already bypassed but remember the court I just read brother Branham was talking about who he was talking about who okay brother Brandon me and you we all bypass but whatever everybody okay we want all no Adam because Adam had a theophany [Applause] tell me a little bit about Adam brother bottom said because in that form theophany he knows what all things and you have never been able to know that yet you and me we did what everybody good you and me we did what you come like who Adam So Adam also did what bypass everybody could but brother Branham say they saw that was in Adam was what yeah we okay now he said you come like who Adam like who me you become from water attributes to water flesh to be water tempted according to 1965 Adam bypass his theophany how many cups do we have now to Camp one say Adam has a water and now they say Adam did water and this one is saying this is after the opening of these Hills let me relax you both of them are right [Music] both of those quotes amen everybody okay second coat for paragraph 79 second Corinthians 5 1 if this Earthly body be what dissolved this every Tabernacle we have a water another one that another one is called water to your funny see we bypass that to come straight from God the attribute to what flesh to be tempted and tested by what sin like who Adam did so in 1957 Adam his soul was a theophany in 1965 brother Branham say Adam bypasses theophany in other words Adam saw didn't have the theophany brother Stephen don't choke me I want my friend everybody okay before we move forward we need to find out how was Adam created and when Adam was created he looked like who because the Bible says that man Adam was created in the image and the likeness of who God so we need to know how was God when he created Adam he was like what everybody okay everybody good brother Branham says here that that Pillar of Fire right there the logos that went out of who God the logos which is actually the what attributes of the water fullness of God the logos is the attribute of the fullness of God it's an attribute everybody okay when God became into a form to where he could be water seen he was the anointing of the great spirit that did what went forth it is what God doing what condescending coming water down down the father and then the what logos that was up over Israel he was holy could not be what to sin so according to brother Branham when God moved here and moved to this place God became the logos everybody okay this logos is called the theophany everybody okay and this place here is what we call the beginning everybody okay we call this the beginning everybody okay in the beginning we're talking about the logos in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God so before the word was here the word was first here everybody okay this word and this word look alike everybody okay but this word here is in the form called the attribute everybody okay let's leave it ready we okay in the beginning what's the water and the Word was with what God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh everybody okay so far now what is what happened in the beginning brother the Bible says this glory to God in first Timothy 6 verse 14 that you keep this commandment without words are rebukable until the appearing of Our Lord what Jesus Christ we need to know how is that Jesus Christ is it the word or is it which in his time he shall show who is the blessed and the only water the king of water Kings and the Lord of what Lord who only has water immortality dwelling in the light so this man here called the word call the logos call theophany call Chris Christians call the pillar of fire he is immortal everybody good and he dwell in a light everybody okay so the word is enlightened amen yes everybody okay the word is a light and that word is immortal are we okay so far dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto whom no man has seen nor can see to whom be on or in power Everlasting water Amen Let me see again that God the way he looks at the beginning the Bible say in Psalm 104 blessed the Lord O My Soul oh Lord my God that are very great there are clothed with honor and water Majesty who covered thyself with what light as a water government everybody okay everybody okay the word is a light it's a garment amen it is a covering everybody okay who stretches out the heaven like a curtain get ready now this first John 1 5 is the this then is the message which we have heard of what him and declare unto you what is the message that God is what life everybody okay God is what life God is what logos God is water God is what Christ God is what God is what everybody okay where are you going Pastor now we have established that the beginning the God that was in the beginning was the light he looked like this everybody okay everybody okay so if he's creating Adam in his own water image and in his own word likeness how will Adam be are we okay glory to God James 1 verse 17 every good water give and every perfect water give Ariana is from a watch above everybody okay and cometh down from the water father of water light stop he's the father of what lights so he's the one that gives birth [Applause] not only one right but many lights [Applause] everybody okay that's why on the day of premikos when the pillar of fire came down the pillar of fire divided himself in many lights everybody okay so when God the Father God the light give birth what did he give birth to his air light and Adam is a son of God [Applause] if you go to the Book of Luke chapter 3 you will see they tell you Isaac the son of Abraham Abraham the son of this and then he goes all the way to Able set set then Adam when he reached Adam Adam didn't have a father Adam didn't have a mama the Bible say Adam the what the Son of God how can God give a son where is the wife of God everybody okay how did he create Adam amen so when the father is the father of what right so when God created he create what life if he created Adam Adam must be how glory to God Amen are we okay have I lost someone 1964. when he met Adam that first man how perfect he was he looked like hook God the Great Water Holy Spirit brooding over the Earth the birds did what come out maybe and then the water animals and what different things and he kept on coming more in the form of the one that was what in other words when God was creating bird create animal create a giraffe create he was approaching towards something that looked like him just just water exactly like the one that was doing the water running exactly like who God God was a man was made in the image of water God so Adam looked like God [Applause] everybody okay so Adam at the beginning was in the form of a tea of honey but how come after the opening of the seals brother Branham say he bypasses the to your father everybody okay glory to God Hallelujah you there now we were first in 1957 which month now 1965. now which month which year are we at 50 1957 which month from August to October how many months difference so when brother made this statement two months later he made another statement what did he say and as he walked through the Water Garden of Eden he's talking about who first as a water the alphony everybody okay the man of Genesis 1 26 was a theophany he was a light the man of Genesis 2 7 look like you and me [Applause] relax now let's drop deep now amen lack the holy spirit is here now walking in here he lets the animal he control water everything that's the man that they say subdue but he could not till the water Genesis 2 7. so God put him in the flesh so that he can do it seal the soil give him water five senses to till the water to fix water and so forth and then men look like what Lonesome oh this is a beautiful water picture are we okay but Ibraham said he bypassed theophany you need to know you need to stay alert 827. look for when he was made first made he was made water to people so the theophany of Adam was not alone [Applause] the Bible said God created man in his own image in his own likeness he created he what and what a female because God himself is male and what female so when Adam was in theophany he was not alone it was two people talking in the theophany everybody okay everybody okay what happened in Genesis 2. he said the Bible said he was God made him buff what male and female created him stay up my friend notice now when man was water separated from the water the alphony and put in what flesh [Music] did you get it no let me read it again [Music] brother Branham said that notice when man was what separated from water the alphanage and put in water flesh everybody okay everybody okay now everybody okay brother brand I'm saying me and you we did what I pass Adam also did whatever Adam at the beginning he was what wait but God took him away from the theophany and left the to your family [Applause] slow down how many people were in the theophany of Adam two notice when man was separated from the water the alphony and put into what flesh he was not just all together the part of his being Eve was still in the alphony so he didn't look what right [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay can I erase this can I raise that leave it or erase it somebody's taking a picture so I'm gonna flip the board can I flip the board glory to God thank God for this beautiful boy I love it less than my wife everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay if I say it I love it to death oh my wife say you love the board more than me so I know how to load those stuff okay everybody okay it's a relaxing time everybody okay now the way man is created man first live in the spirit amen then Adam move straight into a theophany everybody okay 80 or funny which we call the water the word everybody okay in the word here Adam was not alone Adam was there in the theophany with his wife everybody okay damn Adam was supposed to move from here into the flesh everybody okay if Adam would move right here to the flesh amen that's it that's it everybody okay everybody okay but one other move from here into theophany God broke Adam there you following me God took Adam off from here are you following me I do not get out everybody okay are you following me when he got out he left his theophany [Applause] are you following me are you following me he's still funny now I'm reading brother in this church the Bible saying what that's all and we and he left out brother Branham say he said that you're funny who was left there that's why when God look he said it is not good for Adam to be what alone because he was too over there how can we leave him one here where is Eve [Applause] [Music] everybody okay everybody good so God took Adam away everybody good everybody good when Adam came out of his theophany you following me he begin to look like this Adam here everybody okay the one that was here amen amen move from here into here yeah yeah here Adam was a spirit in sanity orphanage remember that theophany can be empty your theophan in heaven now is empty because you are here everybody okay in here the theophany was blocked then God took Adam off and the space of Adam was now empty everybody okay Adam that came out was the Adam's spirit and he was the Adam that was here now Adam is back again to the attribute [Applause] anybody okay then when God take him and put him back here Adam is moving now from attribute to water that's why he bypass [Applause] everybody okay that's why he bypass [Applause] and then later on when God made if he went and pulled Eve here and put it there and bloody off and he was now empty [Applause] Have I Lost somebody if I lost you raise your hand glory to God everybody okay where are you going with this brother Stephen everybody okay everybody okay when Adam move from here and was put in the flesh you follow me you follow me watch carefully what I'm saying now Adam the spirit now is living in the and the Spirit In the Flesh has a soul everybody okay but there is no more tea of Honey watch carefully brother Branham say in starting water 62 but what God did he did what breathe the water of Water eternal life according to this picture amen in 1957 Adam he's the offer his soul was what but etiosity have what eternal life everybody okay everybody okay has eternal life why is God giving Adam eternal life um I'm saving you I don't know if 60 years of trouble everybody okay by the bottom say God breathe water breath of water eternal life is your microphone okay breath of eternal life amen then he become a water living soul that water can't die Kenneth die if the soul of Adam was a theophany could that Soul die but why is God giving him eternal life because that Soul was not your funny the way you think everybody okay everybody okay another word when Adam move from here to there he needed eternalize because he left eternal life you follow me when Adam left his theophany he left eternal life everybody okay that's why he was put in flesh he needed eternal life now God come and breathe he didn't bring him his theophany he breathed he give you the Holy Ghost because you don't have your to your family [Applause] everybody okay so when God is coming down to baptize you with the Holy Ghost he's sealing your soul because you bypass your tea of honey [Applause] okay is everybody okay if I have to preach this three Sunday I will do it everybody good may God help me now watch now we are going to get into water honey plant to the water elbows amen he breathed water the breath of eternal life into his water he became a water Journal soul etiophane is eternal why do you give Eternal to theophany he says because God breathed not what nature done but what God did he breathed the breath of water life into the noise to his naughty and he became a what living Soul then you say to me Adam die brother Branham but remember before Adam died he had the what the lamb that was what we deemed him Hallelujah those who he who knew he has what called he got the lamb to redeem damn he was a tap Adam fell then the lamb was provided for who Adam because already in his nostril he had become the water of Eternal God and he became a living Soul he was a son of God [Applause] brother Stephen I got it now so the court in 1965 that Adam bypassed the tea of an Israelite but I still have a question brother Stephen let's repeat what the prophet said say what the tape say that quote to brother Branham say they saw these etiophany what you saying makes sense in the scripture and in the message help me a little bit more pastor wait everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay buckle up in First Peter verse 1 chapter 1 verse 23 the Bible said that we are what being born again not with what corruptible seed but with water Incorruptible stop Paul in First Corinth and say that when this corruption incorruption so in corruption is an attribute of theophany [Applause] Immortal is an attribute of theophany [Applause] everybody okay and Paul is saying that when we are born again we are born again with something that is uncorruptable We Are Born Again by the theostomy the father of light by the water word of God the theophan is the word which do what living forever because the theophan is eternal everybody okay so the theophany is a living word that's right it's a word that can move it's a word that can talk everybody okay everybody good James 1 18 of his own he has done what because

amen so God when he moved he have children [Music] like Abraham had children lucky you had your children when you move your children are in you that's why liver in the launch of Abraham good big path unto Melchizedek everybody okay everybody good so now when God is ready to pull you out of him amen what God tried to pull is not your soul everybody okay everybody okay before God pull you out God need a house are you following me where he's gonna put you everybody okay are you following me please stay up okay okay God before he take you from him and put you in this world he means to create a house that house has three parts everybody okay everybody okay the first part of you that God create is your soul amen this is the first part of you number one everybody okay after God created the soul the soul is what we call Brother caliber but that is not really brother Kelly brother Caleb is still in God I'm gonna go slowly I'm gonna go slowly okay then God said brother Caleb is a human being he need a human Spirit if he was an elephant I need to give him a spirit of an elephant if he is a bird I need to give him a spirit of a bird because he's human I need to make a spirit that is human then God create after that a spirit are you following me amen then after the spirit God say okay now the song and the spirit must be inside a container everybody good then God create in that container what we call your body all your flesh everybody okay everybody okay God creates you as a tabernacle [Music] everybody okay the body is your other coach [Applause] are you okay your body is the other code that's why in this other court you will see there is a level that's why we baptize the body [Applause] [Music] did you get that that's why we put the body in the bow in the water you don't put the spirit in the water because the other court is where water baptism is your flesh you need the cross to maintain your flesh all the way to the Rapture those two equipment are in the other court everybody okay when you move to the holiest you find the shoveling and you find the wine and you find the light men shall not live by what by every water everybody okay everybody good but if you get to the holiest there is only one furniture foreign ature is the ark brother Emma amen and on top of Ariana rain Cable Guy according everybody okay there is something that is called The Mercy Seat [Music] and The Mercy Seat is a throne everybody okay everybody okay in the dedication in the Bible when they were putting down the the furniture of Moses when they put the table they put the delivery God didn't come amen God was still outside because his throne is not there are you following me but when the priest father be carefully pick up the ark and begin to bring the ark God stood up from his chair he begin to fix his bed God began to wrap his fingers he said to the priest hurry up hurry up hurry up as soon as they took the ark you follow me and they put it in the obvious in the soul [Applause] do you follow me the ark have the prawn of God God moves straight and enter over there and start between the two Caribbean [Applause] do you follow me Dada have to be put by a priest in the Old Testament what are you trying to say are you there when God creates you everybody okay God create your soul then he create your spirit then he creates your body in your mother everybody okay when you are born from Mama do you follow me when your body come out from the delivery room these two parts enter into you do you follow me this right here amen is not really you it is only a tabernacle in three parts it is one Tabernacle that have three compartments everybody okay what are you trying to say what are you trying to say everybody okay once you are born God now opened his loins everybody okay and he take you the word the seed there Eternal one and God pull you [Music] do you follow me God pull your Ark of the Covenant [Music] [Applause] God opened himself and he searched the Ark of the Covenant of brother Joe that I've caused the Covenant is the word is the seed it is eternal then God has Melchizedek as a priest pull the ark and come into your soul and he bypass your body he bypass your spirit and God goes inside your soul and he dropped himself his ark as a problem that he God will one day come into you and enter and sit right there did I lost you another word when you are born in this word to make it simple God get the seed this seed is what we call predestinated amen and God take the seed and put it in your soul now you become body everybody okay spirit everybody okay so everybody okay and it's sad that so there is you [Applause] this song has a beginning it has an end the spirit has a beginning it has an end this body has a beginning he has an end but the you that is there you never have a beginning [Applause] I don't know if we okay I don't know if we okay I don't know if we okay this everybody okay this word here in God is in a seed form everybody okay when God's Pocket amen he becomes a tear funny God when he makes your theophany he doesn't make your tea off any just like that that's not the way God makes it God have a reference God has a blueprint amen when you wanna because your tea or funny looks different than Angelos theophany amen where did God get that picture of you to make you different than angel where was that picture why are you different than uh brother polycop where was that picture why is your head a certain way and brought a polycarp head a certain way where did God get the ship everybody okay those were here everybody okay do you follow me so when God make your tea or funny he's looking at your predestinated seed I'm going slow now amen he looked the predestinate the seed have this kind of nose and God make you to your funny like that amen another word your theophany is a duplicate of your predestinated seed everybody okay everybody okay so when God take your seed don't look like your theophany and put it in the soul everybody okay everybody okay yourself resemble your honey everybody okay that's why when you die you won't take anybody else to your family you and you come out from your body you will see somebody that look like you how did he look like you where did he get your phone from your mother because some people die as a baby Sharon Rose die as a baby but when brother Branham saw Sharon Rose she was an adult lady where was that picture of her dog taken from because Sharon never reached that age but in heaven she was a grown-up woman that grown-up woman that ship that body where did God get it because in the earth we didn't see that that body already existed he was first I thought Francis seed inside of God then God look at you inside and make a copy of you call your theophany and your body here will only follow the shape of your theophany which is the shape of the real you amen everybody okay so when God is baptizing you with the Holy Ghost amen amen everybody okay the Ark of the Covenant has the Throne of God if you take the ark out of the Tabernacle God doesn't have any more seat that's why when the ark was taken out from Israel the Bible call it a cupboard because the glory of the Lord has water it was not really God that left out but the throne of God was taken out so when God comes in the Tabernacle he cannot he doesn't have any seat everybody okay he will walk around walk around and go I don't know if you get me God get into other people's life and God can walk in the flesh God can work in the spirit when God can get in the soul but when God gets in the soul he does a family seat you follow me when there is no seat God say all this is not my child God get out [Music] everybody okay but if it is a predestinated and he was putting yourself when you begin to feel cold chills the anointing of God hold on he's just entering the Tabernacle let him move from the body into the spirit when he move in the spirit you begin to speak in tongues let him do what he's doing he's gonna move from the spirit and he entered the soul when he entered the song he's looking for his chair everybody okay when he see the predestined the thing he said press the Lord is my turn [Applause] with the Holy Spirit you are sealed with the Holy Spirit [Applause] that's why brother Branham said in North seed there is nothing to Quicken the baptism of the Holy Ghost is God looking for his seed it is not you God doesn't care about your head he's looking at the seed as love as he sees the seed God's job and he seals you until the day of redemption [Applause] that is the baptism of the Holy Spirit [Applause] everybody clear so when you are born again you are born of The Incorruptible it is a birth that is not of sex it is the word coming to the word it is God looking for God [Applause] it is God looking for his children when God entered he said that's my child before the foundation of the world I remember you this was you I am Mama ego fly your wings flop your wings you're not the chicken you are an eagle I am looking for you where were you understand come on buddy let's go home [Applause] I have to stop [Applause] I have to stop [Applause] people are confused of what is the Holy Ghost if you don't have this you will never receive the Holy Ghost you can pray all you want God will never give you the Holy Ghost he can give you the anointing but after a while he will go away then you become anointed one of the end time but if you are seed of God pass me not to Gentle Savior because if he come my way he is locked [Applause] right [Applause] your predestinated seed is your identification it is your DNA [Applause] when God sees that it doesn't matter if you were born of a prostitute [Applause] even if you don't know your biological father that's not the problem Marquis said that is your father he put the seed in you before the foundation of the world the China he choose for you to come has nothing to do with you [Applause] I'm sorry y'all time is gone let me sit here let's go to first king and I stop here [Applause] I am in 25 percent of the sermon all these quotes were given to me like within the last three days and it took everything that I have last week and push it back but I can't even move forward let's go to first king chapter 14. I'm going to stop here the soul is the theophany it is not the actual tea of honey it is the theophany in seed form [Music] it is the Divine part of God because if God look at your spirit there is trouble if you look at your soul there is trouble if you look at your flesh you got tattoo and everything but the devil can put tattoo on your body he can tattoo your mind with bad things that you did in the past but he cannot tattoo the predestinated [Applause] time is gone I would have shown you where brother Branham say as that predestined they see this what we move all your sins [Applause] let's go to first king chapter 14. Lord help me oh my God are you there I'm sorry yeah we said the baptism of the Holy Spirit what is the baptism of the Holy Spirit there is something really even stronger than what you're thinking now when you have a seed what is inside the seed what is inside the seed okay if it's a seed of God what kind of life is in the sea I will get to that later when did you get eternal life where did you get eternal life do you see how people are confused let's chill out let's go to first king verse 14 chapter 14. at that time who abhija the son of who you know jeroboam was a bad man in the Bible everybody knows that if you don't know review that at home because I gotta stop here if I continue what is coming up is heavy amen jeroboam verse 2 and jeroboam say to his wife erase I pray you and do what disguise herself why do you want your wife to discuss because he was so bad now his son fell sick he needed God and if he comes they will say that's the son of uh that's the wife of jeroboa God will refuse so he thought his wife disguise yourself to be another woman and go to the prophet so when the prophet sees you will think it's another woman and heal the child everybody okay jehovaham said to his wife eraz I pray you and discuss yourself that you'll be not known to be the wife of Hope because he was a bad man you read the scripture you will see and get you to shallow behold there is who the Prophet The Prophet that put him in power which taught me that I should be king over these people and take you 10 loaves so give the offering and crack nails and Crews of honey and go to him he shall tell you what shall become of earth water sure because the child is sick and jeroboam wife did so and he rose and went to shallow and came to the house of Elijah which was the prophet but Elijah could not what see for he his eyes were set by reason of water Elijah was not blind so he works perfectly number one he cannot see number two the wife is disgust so the wife will pass and the prophet will say okay get here in Jesus name go everybody okay look at prophetic eye now you there you there now verse 5 and the Lord said to ahaja behold the wife of jeroboam come to ask a thing of you for her son for he is sick thus and thus shall you say to her for it shall be when she come in that she shall feign herself to be another woman that's a different eye so the prophet already they downloaded the information the prophet is already loaded so this woman is coming how are you doing it's me say fun amen verse 6 and it was so when ahaja heard the sound of what her feet not her voice the prophet is already loaded that software never miss when they lie when they had your heart he didn't even wait for The Voice amen he just begin to unload he was like a gun that was prepared and begin before even she get there that was it and then when he began to heal defeat as he came at the door as she came at the door that he said come in you wife of who a blind man just hear it he said yeah come in you wife of jeroboam I believe that the woman was almost like everybody okay why send you yourself to be another for I am sent to you with water heavy I have a big news for you a bad one verse 7 go tell jeroboam the one who sent you said the Lord God of Israel for as much as you have exalted as as for as much as I exalt you from among the people and made you preach Over My People Israel when the kingdom was split they took it from Solomon and gave it to him and he messed up and went the kingdom away from the house of David and give it to you and yet you have not been as much servant David who kept my commandment and who followed me with all his heart to do that only which was right in my eyes but have done evil above all that were before you for you have gone and made you other God and molten image to provoke me to anger and to cast me behind your back therefore follow me carefully behold I will bring evil upon the house of jeroboam and I will cut off from jeroboam him that urinate against the wall well it means a man that's a habit of men amen [Applause] go look at another translation he will tell you that he means man go to missionary work with them everybody okay when there is no no bathroom somewhere then you will understand and him that is shut and left in Israel because the men are carrier of seed and I would take away the remnant of the House of jeroboam as a man taketh away water till it's all water gone everybody okay him that died of jeroboam in the city shall be shall the dog do what to eat and he that dies in the field shall defile of the air do what eats for the Lord Has Done worship so the whole house is doomed a very bad man and him his wife can join together a woman that doesn't stand and tell her husband that this is wrong when her husband says something she John everybody okay God say I'm gonna destroy everybody and if you die in the city the dog will eat you if you die so in other words wipe them completely but they came because of a child a child born of a bad father mama a child that is doomed because she was born in a bad family let's see what happened to this chart verse 12 you there arouse you therefore get to your own house and when your feet enter into the city the child shall do what to die what about tragedy what a tragedy you want to see something let's see verse 13. and all Israel shall moon for who him stop everybody of the House of Jehovah no funeral service when they die the dog eat them when they die the bird eat them when they die somewhere they will be as a dog no funeral but some reason for this child God said this one will have a funeral service why but brother Stephen he is this is a son he's the seed of jeroboam he's the child of a bad father you doom everybody why cannot you doom this one you ready verse 13 all Isaiah what mourn for him this child will have a national funeral the entire nation have to stop when this child is dead nobody else except this child what is in this chart can I continue oh verse 13 and all Israel shall moan for him and to water bury him the only one that God will allow to bury why this special treatment for he what only this is the only one in this bad family amen for he only of who even though he came from a wrong seed amen but this is the only one of jeroboam shall come to the Grave because in him a child there is fun some good thing toward what the Lord God of Israel in the house of water a baby that cannot talk a baby that cannot pray a baby that doesn't know anything but when God look at the house of Jehovah he said this one not mine this one destroy him this one destroy him this one destroy him he looked he said how did you make it to this family because when God look at the baby something is sad the baby look at God and begin to flush [Applause] he was the predestinedity telling him that hey hey watch out watch out when God look he said oh my God okay clean everybody not this one why because in him there is this thing right here because there is this thing that thing is good toward [Applause] that thing is good toward when God met the Rich Young Ruler he said good water Jesus said there is no good but who God so the good is who God and something good in that Chad was what God was who God talking to who when God see God what happened let's stand [Applause] everybody okay it doesn't matter which family you are born it doesn't matter if your mama dump you on there on the on the trash can because she was a teenager she got pregnant she could not take care of you and they take you a foster child don't get angry at your parent don't get angry at your mother don't get angry because your father was smoking that has nothing to do with you what God is looking is her the soul that was in man was that to your funny let me stop here let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly again father this afternoon Lord thanking you for your grace for your love and for your mercy father thank you for predestination thank you for the Eternal seed of God because now we begin to understand who we are that's why certain things that other kid did could not feed us that's why you bypass the condition of the woman at the well there were many women that were more righteous than her but you didn't look at the righteousness of men even though she changes husband you met her with six husbands that didn't block you you were already determined to go to Jerusalem to finish your trip but there was enlightened that was flashing somewhere there was a predestinated seat that was calling out somewhere and you told your disciple that there is a need that I must go by Samaria why you told us you will go into Jerusalem why are you changing destination what is in Samaria there was a seed there that was calling father many things happen in our life that we don't even understand why we hated ourselves we hated our fathers we hated our family member who treated us bad when everybody was going to the nightclub they didn't want me to go they left me home and I wanted to have fun like them but for some reason I was the outcast why was that treated like that why did I ever never fit even though I try I try but every time I go back I feel myself miserable I feel my life miserable I thought what they call the world have enjoyment but every time I do it I feel condemned in myself after watching pornography I feel condemned after going out with the boys I feel condemned I feel a shame of myself sometimes I feel like I need to take my life off what is going on with me it is the predestinated city it is the real me it is the identification it is the DNA because without that we could have been lost but you told your disciple that all that the father have given me I have lost none of them father help the church catch this revelation help us realize Who We Are so that we can let everything go and surrender to that which will nurture and let grow that seed that in Israel that is in US father May the Holy Spirit continue to minister to your children as they will review may you take them in deeper death so that they can see this child of jeroboam never even reach a grown-up age but he was taken out right there no one that the other Thief at the cross could turn around and say we did bad but not this man what makes him reckon us he's wrong and he cried out he said Lord remember me father he was not him that was crying he was the seed he was the word that was giving you the last signal that looked deep before you lose your breath of life do you want to leave me this way and as soon as you look at him you forgot that he needed to get baptized you bypass what a baptism you bypass some of your requirements yourself you said this day not even tomorrow you didn't call the disciple to come and show him how to repent right there you took him because in him was found something that was eternal with you father May your children focus on that I commit them unto their hand Lord in Jesus preciousness Hallelujah God bless you Church we love you we prepare for the word about this [Applause] the original line the original scene the original word that's what I believe foreign [Music] [Applause] original one that's what I believe [Applause] [Music] God's attributes age [Music] [Music] [Music] that's what I believe [Music] the original understanding [Music] [Music]
