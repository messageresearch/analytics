========================================

Beast a power that were all the UND denominations and so forth that won't join him with them be shut out as watch and see if that happens I've got it wrote down here the very day we the Lord let me see that 1933 and here it is just exactly where it where it said just coming the same way how the pope would leave Rome and so forth now there are good people but mistaken Joseph and Mary was fine people but real mistaken but what was it God used a 12year old boy to show that that word has to stay pure exactly what it was what it said the first place he was virgin born and that's what he was thinking he was with them when they joined the churches and St but it wasn't now but to the elected now that's a darkness and I can stay on that for another hour but to the elected precious and called saints of God I say to you this coming year Shalom God's peace our is here I could have been back there before the days that the world was created and looked down and seen the whole thing and the father had said to me what day would you want to live I said now right now amen this is the hour this is the greatest hour that the church has ever moved into just before the coming of the bridegroom all the real Church of the Living God ought to be on fire burning with the light of the Gospel being V among them Rise and Shine for the light to come to you the light of this day Isaiah was the light of his day Noah was the light of his day why he had the word manifested and the gospel the Bible words for this day is the light of the day what a glorious time that we're living now good morning peace darkness is gathering what's together for to show the light Isaiah 161 rise and sh for the light has come to you that's the reason I say shalom the light has come to you God's peace to the elected woman to the elected L those who got before the foundation world called out and ordain to that rest never see they'll never know the Bible said so Jesus said no man will come to me except my father draws me first and all the father to me will come that's there stood Judas light shining up here but back in his heart was dark seed when The Showdown come the darkness show here was the little woman all blacked out up here in front but down here was a predestinated seed and when the light come it's scattered the dark and showed forth we know messiah's coming in he does he'll show us these things Jesus said I am he but Judas doubted it yetos in the light see the light up here doesn't matter it's the light down here that counts the light up here walk and fellowship and everything else but when the real power of God comes in it can't come back to this Dead Sea it'll reflect off in the denomination but when it's back down here a genuine predestinated seed when that light comes down here shows all the darkness away from you and puts you in fellowship with Christ he was the one who gave you the life before the foundation of the world otherwise you'll never see it but God said now to you predestinated seed Shalom amen God's peace rest up on you because we're near the end now we're right down near the end we're going to talk about that group for a while Shalom God's light has come the word light is Vindicated again so that you can see the manifestations of the promise of God for this day search the scripture and then you think you have eternal life the day that we're living in what is the line of the day what do the Bible promise for this day see what hour it is no wonder if Jesus rebuked him for not believing John he was the light because the prophet said he would come and there he was the manifested light they didn't see it they didn't understand it they thought it was the Messiah and they thought something else and this another they failed to see it Jesus come on two lights can't shine the same time there can't be a church God light shine at the same time got to be God's light puts out the church light that's exactly what's taking place today God separating churchism from his life of the promised word of this hour that we're living in that's the truth friend you might not want to believe that but you just wait to find out if it's so or not don't wait you better get in right now while there is a chance to get in the word is life what it's Vindicated praise the Lord amen and amen amen we are once again privileged to be in the presence of the Lord tonight amen I just want to come before his throne of grace tonight and commit ourselves into the hands of the Lord and commit the service into the Lord's hands amen can we all pray together

about there's certain places you look forward to going and preaching because you know the people are going to pull on the world on the word and I'll let you in on the secret this is one of those places amen so we really enjoy getting to come here and and get to uh get to just share the word of the Lord with you you amen uh to be honest I'm I'm a little caught off guard even though brother uh Stephen invited me last week the lord caught me off guard I had been I had been studying something out all week and probably about two weeks ago the lord gave me a thought and I put it together or Lord put it together you know I guess it's for another time but but he woke me up a couple weeks ago about i' say 5 in the morning before church and I just started had a little thought come to my heart and it just kind of filled all together and I said well you know I guess Seth said I'll preach that t tonight but that wasn't what the Lord said so I I went down to my study about three o'clock and the Lord just soon as I sat down he just laid something else on my heart and very simple thought this this evening but I'm so glad that God is in Simplicity amen I tell you what I'm glad that uh he he made it simple for for an old country boy like me that I can't figure nothing else out I'm not smart enough amen amen but if you have your Bibles I'd like to start and Jeremiah 2911 and amen amen y'all better be careful Solomon might start preaching from the seat back there y'all pull too hard we can do a tag team if you want amen about 30 minutes I'll come back there and you come up here all right amen Jeremiah y'all have to forgive me amen amen Jeremiah 29:11 it says for I know the thoughts that I think towards you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end now if you notice amen if you notice here in the 13th verse and it said and you shall seek me and find me when you shall search for me with all your heart now I want to if you turn your Bibles to Mark 5:35 I want to speak on something that the Lord laid on my heart of trouble the master trouble the master amen trouble the master I was putting out putting out some mulch around my house a couple weeks ago and and I started thinking about that trouble why trouble the master any farther and Lord just laid that on my heart at that time and I guess it was resting there for this time Mark 5:35 it says while he yet spake there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house a certain which said thy daughter is dead why trouble us the master any further and as soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken he saith under the ruler of the synagogue be not afraid only believe Amen Let Us bow our heads dear heavenly father Lord Jesus we come before you tonight Lord and father you know from My Heart Lord I'm trying to obey your word Lord father Lord there's Lord in my own ability Lord there would be other things Lord that in that Seth coffee would would want to preach Lord if I'm being honest but Lord you laid this little thought on my heart father and who am I Lord to go go against the mind of god father but Lord we just ask in this service Lord father as we try to obey your will Lord in your way father we just pray Lord God that you would have preeminence in this service Lord father if I speak a word Lord it wouldn't make it past this pull pit but Lord if you spoke a word Lord it could change an eternal destination almighty God it would be the words of Life father Lord we pray Lord that in the right way Lord we could trouble you this evening Lord Lord we could trouble you to your attention almighty God that that you would come Lord and move Among Us Lord in a special way father Lord I'm asking Lord that you would touch each and every heart father I'm asking Lord you would open my mouth to the words you would want to say Lord and close my mouth to the things you don't want to say almighty god father we thank you for this day and all that you've done for us Lord father that we were able to wake up Lord in our right mind Lord God lord there's many people that couldn't say that today oh my Mighty God father but Lord You've took care of us today Lord you brought us to this place Lord to hear from you Lord and we just pray Lord have your will and way in this service almighty God lord we ask father Lord you said ask abundantly father Lord that your joy may be full Lord we're asking father Lord that you would just pour out your blessings on this service Lord pour out whatever you want to pour out Lord and we'll receive it Lord with Thanksgiving almighty god father we love you we praise you and we thank you for all that you do do for us in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen you may be seated amen so this Mark 5:35 the story that is in the Bible actually starts with a man by the name of Jas and I call it Jas I know there's many different ways that you could say it but but that's the way that I've always said it and and you can look at this man jaras and and and brother Brandon would call jaras a secret believer that's right he would begin to say that that that he seen Jesus and he knew Jesus was right but because of of all the things that were tied to him that's you know he was a popular person and a lot of people liked him and and you know he just had a good reputation among the people and he knew that if he ever took sides with this Jesus then he would have to give up the other things and and because of this in his life he he you know he had all this going right for him but I believe with all my heart that down inside of Jas was a predestinated seed on the inside of him and almighty God was not going to let that predestinated seed fall in the wrong ground but it was actually in good ground it just needed to be manifested is that right and Jas one day see God will actually allow things to happen to get you into the position that you need to be so because jaras was wanting to be a secret believer or you know he's seen these things God would actually just like job God would begin to allow Satan to say do whatever you want to him but don't take his life so so would actually begin to attack the house of jaras so that God could get Jas in the place that he needed to be so God would take this trial he would take this situation and put it in gas's house you know I don't know how long it happened but but maybe one day he began maybe two months before Jesus was ever to walk through that land his little daughter began to get sick it wasn't nothing too crazy but maybe she began to take a little bit of a fever and and you know week after week thought that the virus would pass but but it begin to get worse and worse and worse and Jas every now and then maybe he'd be going can I just dramatize this for a little bit maybe every now and then he would be going down throughout the streets and he would begin to see somebody with their hands raised up and praising almighty God and he be to say well what are you praising God for and he be let me to tell you I was once a leper but this man named Jesus came by and he touched me and I asked him Lord if thou will if thou just will I can be made whole and Jesus looked at me in the face jaras and he looked right at me and he said I will and from that moment on my skin begin to grow back normal it was a miracle in that moment that almighty God healed me and he be to think you know I've read of a god like that I'm in these books day in and day out and I've read of a god like that all throughout my life and I want to see a living God like that and he begin to think in the back of his M you know I have a little daughter back at home that needs a living God like that in our life and you know he begin to he began to go through his life there and he begin to go to the synagogue day in and and day out and teaching and doing everything that he could but but you know in all that he begin to realize there's something lacking in my life he be to realize there's something lacking in this church we need a living God Among Us you know they they might have begin to to pray for their daughter and she just kept getting worse and worse and worse and finally it came down to a time of decision for jeras on which side of the road he was going to be on was he going to be on the side of the Pharisees and the and the self-righteous or or would he take up this cross with the Lord Jesus Christ and one day he began to say you know if I don't make a decision now my daughter's going to die and there'll be nothing left so he begins to make the decision you know what I don't care what it cost me Hallelujah I don't care what it comes to Hallelujah I know that there's a living God in the land at this time yes my brother and if I can just get to him if I can just trouble the master I've heard what's happened for the leper I've heard what's happened for the blind I've heard what's happened for the beggar I know that that same God he can do it for my house yes my brother yes sir he also knew that it would take him Hallelujah forgetting himself that's right and coming to a place where he was willing to trouble the master yes my brother yes and he began to go on on a journey and brother Brandon would would tap it as a few hours long go ahead and he would go into a journey and he would finally come to the Lord Jesus cuz maybe his wife was was sitting there and said honey she ain't got much longer and maybe he has a little private conversation with his wife and he says I've got to go and maybe she begins to say you know I felt the whole time that this was the right thing and we need to do it and he begin to say you know it might cost me everything and brother Brandon Begin to say that that because they didn't have the same Fellowship card everybody in the synagogue said if you even if you uh associate with this he said there's a lot of people out there that want to associate with this but they can't associate with it they're worried about what everybody else thinks that's exactly right but he said you know it's come to the time of decision yes sir and he went out there and he found this Jesus and he said if you'll just come into my house and if you'll just lay your hands on my daughter I know that she'll be well and Jesus said I will go and Jesus begins to go with them and even on the way there there's a woman with a blood issue that presses her way through the crowd she's trying to get to the master to trouble the master and she begins to work her way through the crowd and she has to push through this one and push through that one and push through what this one says and get through what that one says but she finally gets to the master and she troubles the master so much that the Lord Jesus said who touched me but a lot of different people were touching him so there was a touch that troubled the master so much that he stopped in his track and he be to look around and he said who touched me you know why because she made up in her mind by saying that if I can just touch his clothes I know I'll be made whole glory to God but she had to be willing to trouble the master yes sir so SAS begins to see this and he begins go my What a Mighty Miracle as they're headed back and and on their way back you see Church this is what I want to get you to take your time brother yes sir it's good to say that God is good and uhuh and our testimonies and our praise reports are great when we get to Jesus and we confess Jesus and oh God's my healer oh God's going to bring me through but where so many Christians fail right is on their way to their praise report you remember the praise request the prayer request and the praise report you done got me messed up saying I'm wrong but but on the way to the praise report you get another prayer request and on the way you've already met Jesus you've already had hands laid on you or whatever it might be the prayer of faith shall save the sick but on the way back but see you can't stop there you got to be willing to trouble the master further yes my brother and and you see after he got the report the great report that Jesus is going to come with me Jesus is going to come to my house Jesus is going to heal my daughter he just healed this one with a blood issue right but then on the way he gets bad news that's it preaching now now you already know that doesn't change the situation but Jas in the moment in the moment Jas is thinking what's going on and he begins to see a man with with sack clock and Ashes on his head and they knew that that was going to be a bad sign he to say what are you doing here and the man looked jeras right in the face see this is where Satan comes to you yes my brother this is where Satan will meet you at when you've been prayed for when when you confessed your faith see brother bam said that God would allow that to happen that he would allow Satan to take his punch at you that's right and if you stop right there that's as far as you'll get but he be to say don't trouble the master any further uhh the devil will look at you and say I don't trouble the master any further sure Jesus is able to do it but are you even worthy to come in his presence should you even ask him come on somebody the devil will tell you that but while Satan is speaking in this mind there's something on the inside of jariah yes my brother he looks at Jesus and Jesus said unto him fear not only believe that's right fear not only believe yes my brother in other words don't worry about what you're seeing don't worry about what you're hearing don't worry about what they're telling you that's fear not only believe yes my [Music] brother I want you to understand what Jesus is saying the man is coming to him from the synagogue and say

it I just want to preach from the heart this evening with everything that's in me we go through life and we think about God and we think about situations and we stress about them all day long we worry about how's this going to turn out how that going to turn out what about my family what about this but we don't take the time to ask we don't take the time to pray we don't take the time to believe

brother I just have to I know it's simple tonight but bear with me bear with me bear with me very deep brother brandom tells a story of blind bmus he said you know usually where Jesus is there's a lot of noise isn't that strange they come into a city one day and they was all making making much noise and them great big old mournful looking priests said why they give me the chills and fever said make them hold their peace and he said if they hold their peace the rocks will immediately cry out amen Church you realize tonight if you don't trouble the master the rocks will if you don't trouble the master with your situations and your problems and the things that you're going through the stones will begin to Crow in Your Place amen am amen life was coming in yes and there they was standing out there on this great mournful condition and little old bartmus he was standing out there he was blind right blind church right he didn't know what to do and directly he heard said who is that some of them said Jesus of Nazareth passes by and he be to say oh Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me yes sir listen church do you realize that that right now Jesus has a lot going on right now Jesus at the time is on his way to Jerusalem to be crucified he's got the sins of the world on his shoulders at this moment but even though he has everything going on and everything ain't on his shoulders at the time he has the time to be troubled that's exactly right he has the time to hear a voice from a little blind man a little blind beggar a blind beggar that couldn't even take care of himself that had to sit by a gate called be begging every day begging for what he could get but one day he said who is that glory to God sometimes God wants to be troubled so bad that when you can't get to him he'll send a preacher to get to you sometimes when you can't get to him he'll meet you right in your house yes my brother he'll meet you right in your prayer room you know why he wants to be troubled yes sir he wants to find you in a glory yes my brother Hallelujah preach he said oh Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me have mercy on me he was speaking at The Rock The Rock rolling out down the street and people screaming and hollering and everything they said now don't trouble the master they said now don't trouble the master quiet I guess he has enough to do so there's no need of you trying to trouble him how many ever said that prayer Lord I know I'm a nobody and and that's true I understand that don't take it out of context what I'm saying be humble about it but don't be scared to ask amen amen amen amen amen amen amen he wanted to speak with the rock I guess he's enough to do there's no need of you trying to trouble him just keep your peace but that didn't stop him no he wanted to speak with a rock and he screamed that much louder oh Jesus thou son of day can I say if if your if your prayers aren't loud enough the first time get a little louder pray a little harder yes my brother it's time to trouble the master yes my brother you see how the enemy sneak in just like with J when when when you start to pray and the enemy hits that takes that shot at you well what about that thing you did that one time church that's under the blood don't let Satan tell you that anymore don't let him bring that up anymore he took that shot at jeras and he began to say jeras don't trouble the master your daughter's already dead and then they come to Blind bardus who ain't even got SAT but one thing he's got is a voice and when he would try to cry out for that voice the enemy would begin to say hold your peace be quiet don't worry about it's just chatter chatter chatter as brother Brandon would say it was just the devil in his ear talking to him but you know he said why do I got to listen to these people why do I got to listen to what they say if Jesus is walking by I want to trouble the master yes my brother Glory H yes sir Glory but that didn't stop him he wanted to speak with a rock and he screamed that much louder oh Jesus th son of David yes have mercy on me have mercy on me and he's blind have mercy on me the first thing you know his little isra caught the sound he turned around the rocket her said bring him here hallelujah and the scripture says and many charged him that he should hold his peace don't tell me to stop preaching this message don't tell me to stop preaching this glorious gospel this is life yes sir this is me troubling the master that's exactly right but he cried the more great deal thou son of David have mercy on me and Jesus Stood Still glory to God you might think Jesus is too busy for you he's got too much going on in the world no sir whether it's the cross of Calvary on his shoulders whatever it might be when you come to him and say Jesus Jesus stand still amen hallelujah glory to God hallelujah God be of good oh Hallelujah and commanded him to be called and they called the blind man yes sir saying unto him be of good Comfort rise he calleth thee he calleth thee Oh a deep call to the deep and he casteth away His Garment Rose brother bandam said it was it was a cold a cold time and and he took that garment and threw it back and said I ain't going to need this no more I ain't going to need this no more Rose and came to Jesus and Jesus answered and said unto him what will thou that I should go unto thee should do unto thee and the blind man said unto him Lord that I might receive my sight and Jesus said unto him go thy way thy faith has made thee whole and immediately immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus in the way glory to God you got time for another like I said this is simple but this is your life this is my life this is where we're walking can you say Amen listen church can you can you can you bear another but listen I I begin to look at this and I can only explain it how God shows it to me and as I was sitting there he began to say show that in Mary and Martha and Lazarus and I said okay Lord and I begin to begin it said then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went and met him but Mary sat still in the house then said Martha unto Jesus Lord if thou Hast been here my brother had not died so she's admitting she has Faith right here right she's admitting that she has faith for the situation if she would have got there if he would have got there before he died then said uh my brother had not died but I know that even now whatsoever thou will ask God God will give it to thee and Jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again Martha said unto him I know he shall rise again at the resurrection at the last day and Je you know I love that scripture exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ask or think because Martha's mind is going to yeah one day he's going to rise again but God's saying listen your brother's going to get two resurrections th brother shall rise again and Martha said un him I know that he shall rise again at the resurrection at the last day and Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth in believeth in me shall never die he said believest thou this in other words are you ready to trouble me over this believest thou this she said to him yay Lord I believe that thou are the Christ the son of God which should come into the world now listen there's a little bit that goes on here we're going to jump from 27 to the 39th verse and listen so so Jesus begins to talk to Martha and Martha runs back and gets Mary and says the master call for you and they begin to talk talk to Jesus and in this time Jesus is crying Jesus is weeping but he done told her I am the resurrection I am the life and and in the 39th verse Jesus said unto her take away the stone come on God take away the stone do you know what happens after to a body after a few days I'm a big hunter I'm a big fisherman I know what happens to a body after a few days after it's dead it ain't the greatest thing to be around and she heard that Jesus was come I'm sorry and Jesus said take away the stone Martha the sister of him that was dead Sith unto the Lord by this time he stinketh for he has been dead four days Jesus said unto her said I not unto thee Jesus said Earth say I not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou shouldest see the glory of God now I imagine when Jesus says this in that moment every single person looks at Martha because remember that's Martha's family member she's the one that has a right to say take that stone away or leave that stone right there you see all that was her family's resting place that was her family's tomb only she had the right her sister had the right to say move the stone away but they begin to look at her and they begin to think they must think in their mind can I say it this way will she trouble the master any further she's already called for the master the master was 4 days late but the master finally showed up she begins to talk to the master and say I know that even now whatever you ask God will do it but now they're one and she's she's already asked all that he's already here he's already gave the promise that he'll rise again but will she trouble the master any further will she trouble the m any further then they took away the stone so at one point Martha must have said run out of the way whatever he says do it just like Mary at the wedding supper whatever he says no matter how crazy it seems if he says put water in the barrel and it'll be wi you better start filling up the [Applause] barrels the place and then they took away the Stone from the place where the dead was laid and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said father I thank thee that thou has heard me and I knew that thou has heard me always but of the people which stand by I said it that they may may believe that thou has sent me and when he had thus spoken he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with grave clothes and his face was bound about with a napkin and Jesus said them loose him and let him go why did the miracle happen because they were not afraid to take God at his word they were not afraid to look at God and say no matter how crazy it sounds up here no matter what Satan is saying in my mind I refuse to believe that and I believe the one and true son of almighty God but I'm say could you imagine a little mouse about that long in the great Garners of Egypt saying I better get two grains a day it might not last through the winter oh my you can't he wants you to ask abundant so that your Joys could be full don't be afraid to ask God for anything for he's willing more willing to give it than you are to receive it if we just get that little Shadow wiped away to know that he's willing to do it you're his children he loves you brother Solomon you thought you knew what it was like to be a father but when you became a father you knew you have all and once you become that mother of Father you always thought you knew what it would be like but until you hold that flesh flesh and blood in your hands for the first time and you begin to hold that child in your hand the first thing that comes over you is an instinctive love that whatever they need I'm going to take care of them whatever they have need of I'm going to do it and you know I'm That Kind of dad that I want to give my children everything that they can have need of I want them to ask abundantly I want them to see what I can provide for them I want to give them the best life on this Earth that I can ever give them anything that I can do to make them happy let me tell you something that ain't nothing compared to the love of almighty God if we're like that with our children and we want our children just ask me you know sometimes you get offended as a parent sometimes you get offended when your child goes and ask other people for stuff because you know they could just come to you and we ain't got to be looking at the devil's tactic and the devil's tricks to make us happy when we got a heavenly father that takes care of [Applause] us I want to try to I'm trying to bring it to a close Jesus said unto her said I not unto thee that if thou th wouldest believe thou should see the glory of God you sang only believe I sang it with you but if we just sing it what good is it but if you will believe tonight you will see the glory of God it's not a if it's not a maybe what do you want how far will you trouble him but by now he stinketh listen but the report was but by now he Seth but by now Jer your daughter is already dead but what does that mean absolutely nothing to almighty God do you realize Glory that at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess do you realize that when Lazarus and jer's daughter was dead they heard the voice voice of the resurrection and they begin at death begin to give up what it had grasped because the resurrection and life had spoke brother bam said now talking about Jas he's got to believe for the impossible but he believed anyhow no matter how impossible it is if Jesus said it it's true amen take him at his word that settles it it's time to forget about our feelings it's time to forget about how we think about it or how we think it should go or how our healing should take place let's trouble the master if God on my way to Healing wants to heal a woman with a blood issue I want to trouble you farther whatever God wants to do I'm going to trouble the master [Music] Satan says you'll be sick forever but my God said he was wounded for my transgressions I'm troubling the master bruised for my iniquities every single one of my iniquities has been nailed to the cross of Calvary Satan you're a liar let's kill a devil real quick that one that keeps saying you're not good enough you'll never make it listen Church of the Living God at your record was done away with Satan you're a liar I'm trying to get through [Applause] this I got a promise if he did it for jeras if he did it for Lazarus if he brought Paul out of sin and made him a preacher if he healed the leper if he healed blind barus if he took that one with the blood issue and healed her if he went by if he went by that just spoke the word at that centurion's house and his servant was made well listen listen brothers and sisters we are not here to look at a god of History we are not here to look at a god of a byone day that is great that is great that the Centurion troubled the

that night but you know what there was something that came over her she began to see if there was a blind man that was in that meeting and she began to say if almighty God can heal that blind man he
