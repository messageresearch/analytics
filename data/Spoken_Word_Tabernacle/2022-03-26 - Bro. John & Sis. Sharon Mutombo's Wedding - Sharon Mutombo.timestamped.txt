[57:02] [Applause]
[57:05] [Music]
[57:09] [Applause]
[57:20] oh
[57:26] i would like to read the portion of the
[57:27] scriptures
[57:31] in genesis chapter 2
[57:35] beginning from verse 20. command
[57:39] [Music]
[57:54] and to every beast of the field yeah
[57:57] today's anniversary
[57:59] but for adam there was not found and
[58:01] help me for him
[58:07] and the lord
[58:08] god caused a deep sleep to fall upon
[58:11] adam
[58:16] and he slept
[58:19] and he took one of his
[58:21] he'll be in the circuit and closed up
[58:24] the flesh instead thereof
[58:27] if you notice the lord never left that
[58:30] door open
[58:34] he
[58:39] and the bible says that and the read
[58:41] which the lord god has taken from men
[58:51] and brought her unto the man
[58:56] so god himself brought his own daughter
[58:59] unto the men
[59:01] remember
[59:12] and flesh of my flesh
[59:15] she shall be called woman
[59:18] because she was taken out of men
[59:20] pascality pleased the lamb therefore
[59:23] shall a man leave his father
[59:27] and his mother
[59:29] and shall cleave unto his wife
[59:33] and they shall be one flesh
[59:37] in the message the invisible union
[59:42] brother branham says that marriage is
[59:44] the oldest institution in the world
[59:51] can you say amen
[59:53] he says that it was performed first and
[59:56] instituted in the garden of eden
[1:00:10] the first is that marriage is very
[1:00:13] important
[1:00:17] very very important
[1:00:20] if you notice the way the holy scripts
[1:00:22] were placed
[1:00:27] the first book in the old testament is
[1:00:30] the book of generals
[1:00:32] [Music]
[1:00:35] and it opened up with a series of events
[1:00:40] in
[1:00:42] and a succession of events in succession
[1:00:46] from the world which was void and
[1:00:48] informed demand
[1:00:51] and then all the way to the garden of
[1:00:53] eden
[1:00:54] and then after god finished that
[1:00:57] genealogy of the earth
[1:01:02] which we commonly call evolution
[1:01:06] and god introduces the first man called
[1:01:10] adam
[1:01:14] that was your first adam
[1:01:18] and if you go to the new testament
[1:01:22] the first book of the new testament is
[1:01:24] the book of matthew
[1:01:28] and we see another genealogy there of
[1:01:31] the lord jesus christ
[1:01:35] starting from abraham
[1:01:42] all the way down
[1:01:44] and then at the end yeah
[1:01:46] the genealogy ended with the second adam
[1:01:50] allegiance
[1:02:16] he was created male and female
[1:02:30] so there was one specie that was missing
[1:02:35] if you go to the book of matthew again
[1:02:40] in the genealogy of the lord jesus
[1:02:42] christ
[1:02:44] the bible says that there were 42
[1:02:46] generations
[1:02:50] but if you can't you will find out that
[1:02:52] it's only 41 generations
[1:02:57] and there was another generation that
[1:02:59] was missing
[1:03:39] if you notice nobody blessed their
[1:03:41] marriage
[1:04:17] so the beginning in the old testament
[1:04:20] started with marriage hello
[1:04:37] even the first miracle of the lord jesus
[1:04:39] christ happened in the day of america
[1:04:46] i don't have time to go through roof and
[1:04:48] buzz
[1:04:51] rebecca and isaac
[1:04:54] all the way to the book of revelation
[1:04:56] with the marriage of the lamb
[1:05:02] and the second point i want to highlight
[1:05:06] [Music]
[1:05:11] if we look in genesis chapter one verse
[1:05:13] 26
[1:05:18] when god created man god
[1:05:48] is male and female
[1:05:52] masculine feminine god is not homosexual
[1:05:55] journey homosexuals god is male and
[1:05:58] female
[1:05:59] a masculine feminine and we found that
[1:06:01] those two mates started from eternity
[1:06:06] [Music]
[1:06:10] before god initiated their marriage
[1:06:14] they already were joined together from
[1:06:31] that when a man loves a woman because i
[1:06:33] know uh m in the farm and marries her
[1:06:36] because she's just pretty ella marie
[1:06:38] pascalis
[1:06:40] there shall be an end to that you're
[1:06:42] right
[1:06:43] but when a man finds a woman that he
[1:06:46] loves
[1:06:47] proven from killem he don't know why he
[1:06:50] nello
[1:06:51] but he loves her male 1 and she found a
[1:06:54] man that she loves
[1:06:57] no matter what he looks like
[1:07:00] he loves now he loves her she loves him
[1:07:04] that is an eternal mate in glory
[1:07:08] [Music]
[1:07:11] death no nothing else can ever separate
[1:07:14] them
[1:07:17] because they are from eternity
[1:07:20] they step out
[1:07:23] in the space of time
[1:07:26] and we
[1:07:54] from the dust of the uh the earth
[1:08:00] the bible says that he breathed the
[1:08:02] breath of life
[1:08:06] and brother branham said that that
[1:08:08] breath was god breathing not man
[1:08:16] brother said that breath was eternal
[1:08:18] life
[1:08:34] but what god did
[1:08:36] you have faith
[1:09:02] before a young man can get married to a
[1:09:05] young woman
[1:09:08] you must settle the question of eternal
[1:09:11] life
[1:09:14] and the same applied to the woman as
[1:09:16] well the resentment
[1:09:23] that adam has a communion between him
[1:09:25] and god alone
[1:09:27] coming your uncle with you and if in
[1:09:30] eternity have communion between her and
[1:09:33] her father
[1:09:38] before anybody can get married you must
[1:09:41] have a personal relationship or intimacy
[1:09:45] with your make-up
[1:09:59] and then put men into that garden
[1:10:04] and the bible says that god placed men
[1:10:06] in the garden so that men can take care
[1:10:09] and dress that
[1:10:15] in other up god gave him a
[1:10:17] responsibility
[1:10:18] before he got married
[1:10:20] i don't return jeremy donald
[1:10:22] responsibility
[1:10:24] no wonder brother branham before he
[1:10:26] marry a couple he always asks a question
[1:10:29] whether the man has a job or not
[1:10:36] because the man must have a
[1:10:37] responsibility
[1:10:40] another responsibility in the response
[1:11:35] and then god initiated the process of
[1:11:38] evil hello
[1:11:56] verse 22.
[1:11:58] whosoever i found the good thing
[1:12:03] an obtainable favor of the lord
[1:12:19] [Music]
[1:12:53] in so much that are regarded that he
[1:12:56] regarded not the offering anymore the
[1:12:58] telemaniac
[1:13:00] in considerably voter fund or receive it
[1:13:03] with good will at your hand
[1:13:06] uh
[1:13:07] there was the woman so god was rebuking
[1:13:10] israel
[1:13:12] israel that the altar of the lord were
[1:13:15] filled with people
[1:13:20] and because of the people that were
[1:13:22] crying upon that altar yeah of course
[1:13:25] they played they just said hotel god
[1:13:27] refused to listen to the prayer of his
[1:13:30] people
[1:13:44] wherefore
[1:13:46] because the lord has been witness
[1:13:49] between thee and the wife of thy youth
[1:13:55] against whom that has dealt
[1:13:57] treacherously
[1:14:07] god could not listen to the prayer of
[1:14:10] israel when they broke the marriage
[1:14:12] covenant
[1:14:26] he said
[1:15:06] [Music]
[1:15:08] and peter said that your prayers also
[1:15:10] can be hindered if you don't keep the
[1:15:12] marriage covenant
[1:15:16] yes
[1:15:18] so brother john and sisters
[1:15:35] [Music]
[1:15:36] that
[1:15:48] everything was from the original
[1:15:51] creation perfect to choose a perfect de
[1:15:54] la creation original the only species
[1:15:57] that was created different
[1:16:02] was a woman
[1:16:03] farmer she was created as a pro as a
[1:16:06] byproduct
[1:16:10] she was created from something that was
[1:16:12] already created
[1:16:16] but there is a very key and a mystery
[1:16:19] that lies with that creation
[1:16:25] because as long as everything was
[1:16:28] perfect in the garden of eden
[1:16:46] god was a redeemer
[1:16:48] but all those attributes were locked
[1:16:51] because everything was perfect in the
[1:16:53] garden of heaven
[1:16:59] the presence of a woman represents
[1:17:02] in the presence of a by-product
[1:17:07] to give god the ability to express his
[1:17:10] attributes
[1:17:12] explanations that you read the word the
[1:17:14] woman unlock the plan of redemption
[1:17:21] if the woman was created as the original
[1:17:24] creation because
[1:18:09] was really an opportunity to god for god
[1:18:12] to show his strengths
[1:18:17] because paul said that his strength is
[1:18:19] made perfect in weakness
[1:19:05] is that marriage reflect the union
[1:19:07] between us and jesus christ
[1:19:13] because god was also male and female
[1:19:15] basketball
[1:19:17] uh masculine effeminate in the book of
[1:19:20] ephesians
[1:19:35] for it
[1:19:36] that he must sanctify and cleanse it the
[1:19:39] short kill
[1:19:41] the washing of water by the world
[1:19:47] that he might present to himself
[1:19:51] a glorious church in atleast glorious
[1:19:54] not having sparta
[1:20:02] or any such things
[1:20:05] but that it should be holy and without
[1:20:07] blemishes
[1:20:10] and in the book of revelation chapter 19
[1:20:12] verse 7.
[1:20:15] revelations
