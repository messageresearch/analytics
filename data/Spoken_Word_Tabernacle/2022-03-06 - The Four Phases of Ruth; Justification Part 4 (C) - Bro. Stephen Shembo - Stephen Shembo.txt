========================================

[Music] oh all things [Music] lord [Music] [Music] i believe [Music] oh [Music] one more time jesus is here [Music] [Applause] [Music] jesus [Music] jesus [Music] amen you believe it this morning let's give the lord a clap offering that'll be all for the music god richly bless you musician you might be seated a little bit so i go through these announcements you know my first question right how many are up to date with the sermon let me see your hand okay okay okay when i'm gonna pick up a second speed you won't be able to catch me up when i will begin to get fried sunday wednesday sunday wednesday you're gonna stay far behind so i'm going slowly so you can catch up and everything should be good amen how many are reading the cod book and the church ages okay okay i am not responsible the trustees told me that uh they will prefer to have the building fund next sunday so it gives somebody more time to kind of prepare for building fund i don't know if somebody else was already prepared but what the trustee told me so if you can hold on to it unless you have it you want to give it to the trustee that's between you and the trustee you can handle it but if somebody was not prepared you again have one more week to go over it amen you continue to pray for the saint in ukraine for what is going on they're right in the middle of the situation they were not prepared and they're not even uh author of the sea of the situation they're just victims of what is going on amen so i didn't want to ask the church to do another offering because we already have our building fund and we still have a lot on our plate to do so what i did i took an offering myself on behalf of the entire church because brother berry has been communicating with me keeping me updated and i was looking at the situation before i can respond so since we got all the green lights that everything is set up where money can be transferred all the way and reach the scent over there i took an offering on behalf of the entire church and i send it through the channel of brotherberry coffee so it can be given to the saint in ukraine amen so we can just help the church move on because we have a lot on our plate everybody clear so far but continue to pray for them amen our sisters meeting went wonderful yesterday they can tell you [Laughter] [Applause] some people wanted to be there but i was trying to be careful i believe you already understood my point there are certain questions that usually brought abraham handled them between the pastors and their congregation and some of those questions came through that meeting so if somebody is not part of this church i don't want to load you up with a lot of stuff and before you know it a pastor is in trouble somewhere because somebody is shooting a lot of scripture amen i remember one time there was a brother who called me say i was a i have a document where i have subject and then i put quotes of brother branham and the brother was asking me to give him the quote that document and i asked the brother i say what are you going to do with it he said well there is a church that is in trouble somewhere else so i was looking for that document and i can give to the brothers over there i say i cannot give it to you that document because if i give it to you i know the courts that are loaded there all it takes is somebody without wisdom and he's going to shoot on the pastor pretty bad amen so the quote and the message are not meant for that amen so when the motive and objective are wrong i am not going to give you scripture and quote to get into a fight or disrespect a local shepherd somewhere so to avoid all those kind of stuff because the subject was very deep we ended up even there i'm sorry i forgot a wonderful coach yesterday so on the next meeting for the sister just remind me i'm going to give you the quote we had to start it from genesis and way down following with birth control so they know now more than you think so you young man those sisters got nuclear weapon [Laughter] amen so you need to be careful make sure you load yourself very good because we went all the way from genesis all the way and pulled it up with the scripture and the coat of brother branham so i didn't want to give all of that for somebody who's under a different wordship and maybe their pastor believes something different and before you know it it's scripture and a fight with a pastor so this is for spoken word it stays here if you hear then i can unload that to you amen oh my god don't get mad on me i have to follow what the deacon told me amen on march 19th we mentioned that we will have our house meeting up to this time i have zero question for the house meeting and march 19th is approaching and matter of fact we have a problem with the venue there was like either a problem with the date so what happened we had 55 questions on the sisters meeting so the deacon asked me if we could use march 19 for the second sister's meeting so at that point we don't rush with the question and brother chim opened his home for march 19th because the venue is already booked so the sister can have a second sister young adult meeting amen so march 19th we're not going to have a house meeting i don't have any question yet it's going to be the second sister's meeting so we can continue with their question they had like 55 we probably touch on maybe six yesterday nine okay nine by god's grade so nine is imperfect so we touch on nine so you know from 55 minus nine you know what your pastors still have to deal with amen so we're going to give them one more opportunity and see how quick we can go with those questions i don't want to rush with them because they're important from some for somebody and we want to make sure they know exactly what they're talking about amen so march 19th it's not a house meeting you can still bring your question but march 19th is going to be the young sisters meeting again and the address will be text to you i cannot give the address on youtube amen but our next house meeting will be on april 9th so you have almost a month to give me questions and put to put them in a box so april now some people have a hard time with the job to prepare so now you know one month ahead if you want to be there you can prepare for april 9th any question so far is somebody happy or somebody's mad i gave you the date it's up to you to fix your schedule and to be there if you're not there i am not responsible i cannot go to your job or get you to your home and put you in the car to bring you into a meeting amen and we're now recording them so when they answer they're gone it's gone amen if you ask me about it i'll tell you you missed that meeting praise the lord amen one more or cup this one i can't handle it here couple announcements brother charles grandfather was released from the hospital after the announcement was given here and the church prayed for it so he was released from the hospital we want to thank the lord for that one [Applause] he's probably streaming because they travel all the way there to be with uh with the family and see him so by god's grace we praise the lord everything is doing good so he want me to mention this to the church you saw the landscaping work that was done on the church outside how he looks beautiful and the man that did it did it beyond what he we he was supposed to do he was supposed to do a certain work not put the trees and everything but he asked for the plan we gave it to him and he did all of that so we call him to make sure the trustee contacted him to make sure we don't owe him any money because he did everything beyond what he was supposed to do he did everything for free [Applause] amen so we save some money so we can work on the equipment body david the internet is okay now okay you will see maybe three times the title uh shoot on youtube because we were struggling with the internet so you pray so everything will be fine i know what the devil is fighting me with exactly what's going on so we will try probably to delete the two first link so you can keep one more amen now let's go straight to our scripture okay okay matthew chapter 13. i'm sorry mama we just had to keep the young sisters only so don't get mad on me if you want to know about what we talk about in detail you organize your own meeting so i can sit down with you and i can unload that for you from genesis all the way where we were there was a young girl that asked me a question so when are we going to have our young young sisters meeting say what is going on no so we had questions about why did the lord came up to paul i say okay okay those are interesting questions but if i have that meeting their parents must be there but don't shock them from asking questions let's go to matthew chapter 13. oh my god if you dare you can say amen verse 15. for these people's heart just a little bit brother david is wax gross in other words the heart is dull unresponsive and the ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed why lest at any time they should see with the eyes you might be seated and here with their ears those eyes are not the natural eyes because they could see christ those ears are not in this one amen that's a different ear god help us and heal with the ears and should understand with their heart not this understanding is not in your brain it's an understanding from the heart amen understand with their heart and should be water so to be converted to be converted according to the scripture you must go through all of this amen you must hear with your hear amen you must hear you must see and you must understand not with your head but you must understand with your heart and then you are converted don't sleep on me today amen and i should heal them so this healing here is not a healing of somebody that is sick physically you remember last sunday we found out that the sickest body of that we know of is the church and that sickest body needs a spiritual healing everybody remember let's go to mark chapter 4. mark chapter 4 verse 12. we're still dealing with ruth if you're there you can say amen that seeing they may see and not perceive the word is understand so you're looking at something but you don't understand it while it's all around you and hearing they may hear and not understand so now understanding is with the seeing and the hearing everybody clear lest at any time they should be converted and they're water so conversion is now related to sin and their sins should be forgiven them now we're looking at conversion and sin being forgiven everybody care let's go to luke chapter 22. these are very short short so we can jump quickly and run luke chapter 22 verse 31 if you dare you can say amen if you still mad at me you need to repent it's called sister's meeting he was not married meeting or outside meeting or in a national meeting your sister's meeting so chill out get the devil off of you okay gee luke chapter 22 and the lord i cannot trust anybody i don't want to give somebody something here and it's on you so it's in uh in australia you give somebody something and it's in south america because this one takes somebody this one takes this one this one takes this one and it's all over amen verse 31 and the lord says salmon salmon this is peter behold satan has desire to have you that he may sift you as wheat what a desire but i have prayed for you jesus when you were praying for someone where were you praying for what were you praying about i have prayed for you that's your water so someone had faith [Music] peter or salmon had faith before pentecost amen amen am i reading a different bible before peter received the holy ghost am i okay before peter received the holy ghost peter already had faith i'm gonna try to help you this holy ghost is tough my friend amen before peter got filled with the holy spirit he already got faith and jesus prayed that the faith that peter already had amen amen you will know if you have the holy ghost or not but i have prayed for you that your faith fell not so this faith peter already have it but you can lose it amen amen are you awake i thought when you have faith everything is finished now peter already have faith peter knew who jesus christ was peter could tell you i know this is the messiah the son of the living god but he could fail with that faith who got the holy ghost and that faith was before the baptism of the holy spirit amen when do you get the holy ghost there hallelujah amen but i have prayed for you that your faith fell if not everybody okay and you okay and when you are water so peter had the faith without conversion amen amen when these things are not taught well in the message this is why we have a confusion we don't know if we have the holy ghost or not and i told you i cannot preach this in one sermon i have to go step by step now you understand the tabernacle the three step now you understand roof as i'm going down it's going to unfold more and the more detail you have the more precise you know now when you want to operate or do surgery on somebody you need to have a lot of detail on anatomy because when you're cutting stuff you cannot be brutal you need to cut stuff according to the anatomy because you don't want to cut an artery or cut a nerve and cause trouble so surgery is a precise science lack of precision oh you're getting this message you got the holy ghost how can you have the holy ghost you preach the message and relieve the message [Music] where you are did you hear the holy ghost peter here [Music] already preached the gospel can i continue this peter preached the gospel this peter healed the sick amen everybody okay these people walk in water on water everybody okay this peter came back rejoicing and jesus said your name is written in the book of life everybody okay this peter he had a lot of miracle that happened with him no holy ghost he preached jesus christ he healed the secret and the people look at the peter they say peter is filled with the holy ghost zero holy ghost all he had by doing all of this is just faith if preachers understand this they will stop preaching and go back and sit down and search for the holy ghost and we won't have shocked with preachers when you sit around the preacher you begin to talk you look at him you wonder if that's the man that was preaching over there he's as bad as a people on the street a racist preacher prejudice preacher a liar sleeping with women lying doing all kinds of stuff and preaching the gospel preaching the message of brother branham [Music] did all of this faith no holy ghost who has the holy ghost and when you are converted so this faith is different than conversion i thought conversion is forgiveness of sin lord jesus christ forgive me my sin and this and this and this and this okay and then i'm converted that's what i thought but now you say converted is different than this different than conversion peter head fifth he was not converted yet i thought when you have faith you are converted let me pull those denominational staff away and when you are converted strengthen your water so you cannot even strengthen a brother if you are not converted amen amen yeah the five four minutes we are for the edifying of the church yes that far far ministry must be converted if not it is not edifying we're just preaching and pumping no result no result no result no result we're reading quotes no result because something is missing everything okay did that rock your boat oh my god let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you humbly father this morning thanking you for your grace for your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father the devil fought me so much since last sunday but me standing here is just a victory of the lamb and i thank you for it lord father we are committing this service unto the hand may you move me completely away from this place may you come lord father and may you speak to your children and bless our soul be the beginning and the ending lord father we rebuke every demonic spirit away from this place every spirit that is contrary to the divine nature of the holy spirit everybody that was exposed to a virus somewhere father may you touch and heal them lord we committed all unto the hand in the name of jesus christ amen amen hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord we are on the four phases of roof justification we talk about the four phases of roof grace the four phases of roof the tabernacle the four phases of roof at the brazen altar now we are the four phases of roof justification brother branham says this that i'm afraid today that too many of us are not getting people to christ we are getting them to a church getting them to a church means they are in the camp like roof was in the camp in the house of elimelech everybody here but roof was not converted yet amen she have not even taken a decision yet brother branham said we are getting them to a church to a theory but we must get them to christ he's the only one and the only one that has life this christ here is not a book amen amen amen this christ here is not a letter on the paper this christ here is a persona [Laughter] he that has the son has life and if the life of a man that is dead be projected in you you will live the same life he lived if you have let out for jesus christ in you why are you not living like jesus christ and you're trying to convince me that you got the life of jesus christ anybody okay when we talk about roof at the present altar or the mystery of the brazen altar we found out that brother branham says this let me quote this and then we go he said your priest your leader and so forth can teach you your religion the word that i'm pulling them is teach everybody okay you can learn the message learning is not bad it depends on where you're learning everybody okay he said you can learn the message that we are trying to teach you can learn it you can put it in your head you can argue with everybody on the facebook you can call all the message young people to charming because you want to start a discussion but still that won't give you eternal life how many people have eternal life you get to accept the person jesus christ you understand that all of you got to accept the person jesus christ to have eternal life now but sometimes other leadership gets so much influence on us until we don't know what to do when that times comes you love your pastor so much you love preachers so and so so much as soon as you leave this church quickly you on the website to watch your preferred preacher and when the very christ is coming you don't even know how to handle him when we talk about the tabernacle we found that the tabernacle have a gate that you must enter when you want to bring people in this message you need to know the appropriate gate everybody here if you bring them through marriage wrong gate if you bring them because they are friends wrong gate if you bring them because they were born in this message wrong gate because on those gates they can learn the message because that's the church they attend that's where the parents were going to church so they'll learn the message they can tell you about the seventh year they can tell you about this and this but they were not born again when you look in the tabernacle there is a gate and this gate in exodus 27 i'm just reminding you the bible said that for the gate of the court shall be a hanging of 20 cubit of blue and purple and scarlet you remember this now and fantuan lenin in other words when you go in the tabernacle the gate was not different than the door i hope you're staying with this sermon everybody okay here we got the court the other court if you are clicking quick we can move faster but now i'm seeing somebody's forgetting stuff quickly the holy place and here we have the holiest these places were separated by curtain anybody okay the first curtain here is what they call the gate the second curtain here is what they call the door and the third curtain here is what they call the veil this curtain was the same thing as this curtain and it was the same thing as this curtain the only difference was the last curtain have caribeams you remember and we know that when the veil was ranked paul told us that that veil was the flesh of jesus christ the one who's on the internet make sure you pull this up everybody okay so this veil was jesus christ this door was jesus christ because he said i am the door and this gate also is jesus christ and back here and when you enter this gate the first thing you see is the and altar everybody here so when you are bringing somebody in the message do you follow me and you are pulling the gate to that person make sure when you get up and up they see the present altar amen [Music] somebody is smoking somebody's drinking somebody's sleeping prostitute on the street you want to talk to her about the seven seal you want to talk to them about the feast of the trumpet you are using the wrong gate they need to repent first hallelujah the bible says that that gate was blue it was purple he was scared and he had fine-tuned learning hey mark here and that gate also had four pillars four the number of the earth the number of deliveries you have four pillars everybody okay and therefore socket the bible says in matthew 7 enter ye in the straight gate because we have the brazen altar here and what follow the brazen altar what was in the level everybody okay he said enter in the straight gate for why this degate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction the easy way destruction and many many people there be which god indirectly so this gate is not popular amen it is a gate that is presented to the elect only amen everybody okay so far and matthew continued he said because strength is the gate if you notice that straight is not straight are you following me if you're sleeping that's your problem this threat is like this it is not this okay it is not this one and usually when we say straight is a gate we thought that was this oh the gate is straight or straight straight that is wrong it is not straight like this it is s-t-r-a-i-t he said straight is the gate and narrow is the way ever clear so this gate is also a way because roof stowed on the way going back to judah anybody okay now he said straight is the gate and narrow is the way and jesus said i am the way everybody which lead it unto water so this gate here when you meet it it's not really life yet amen amen are we okay it is a gate that opened to lead you into life [Music] hallelujah and few it is not popular whether the congregation and the preacher feel few dare be defunded brother brother help me decode this how is the gate the gate his water everybody here jesus said shrek is the gate he was talking about himself because the gate was the way and jesus said i am the way i am the truth and i am water is that right what i'm saying how is it spell s-t r-a-i-t everybody here or this one it is not this one brother branham said that s-t-r-a-i-t means water in other words warner is the gate everybody clear it's a gate when you open up somehow down the road you must meet water he said where is the gate how do you come in by water repent you are in the present altar every one of you and be water you are in the level so this gate when he opened up he have to present to you the present altar and after the present hotel it will present to you deliver the present altar for your repentance and the water for your baptism everybody here and we baptize in the name of jesus christ unlocks the water and that gate has four pillars the bible says in the book of revelation chapter 3 that him that overcometh will i make a pillar so a pillar is also a person the bible says in the book of proverbs that wisdom has built herself a house and wisdom is sitting upon how many pillars seven pillars here so the wisdom of god have seven person and if you take those seven persons and you put them together you have the entire wisdom of god everybody okay because throughout the seven churches jesus we have seven messengers and every messenger has an angel that he was working with him but in this end time we found seven angels meeting together and bringing the head of jesus christ which is the wisdom of god [Music] everybody okay the bible says overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out [Music] there is a lot with this pillar let me continue and i will write upon him that pillar that person the name of my god who's the name of god you remember the uh the road of aaron yes sir you have to put the name of aaron the high priest on you remember and the name of the city of my god which is the new jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from water so we understand here that a pillar can be a person and this gate was held by four pillars it's a gate that is held by four people and we know that jesus have to have disciples and among those 12 disciples one of them was called matthew one of them was called mark one of them was called luke and one of them was called john and those four people wrote the gospel of jesus christ carrying the life of jesus christ in the four gospel so when you meet somebody who's coming in the message you must preach to him the gospel first [Music] everybody okay so far let's go to roman one the message is the gospel but you gotta know what you're bringing from the message you don't meet somebody drinking beer and you say the seven seal was revealed anybody here you tell him that at the opening of the sixth seal everybody clear let's go to roman chapter one this gate have blue fellowship scarlet you know what it means fine learning the righteousness of descent hey let's go to uh verse 15 so as much as in me is this is paul i'm ready to preach water the gospel to you that are at room also for i am not ashamed of the gospel of who for it is the water everybody okay this is what you pull into somebody it is the power of god to water this gate first for salvation because the person needs to be born again anybody here it is the power of god to salvation to everyone that do whatever believe to the jew first and also to the greek for their in in the gospel everybody here is the water the fine linen anybody okay in the gospel is the foreign language the righteousness of god water revealed from water so you must go from faith to water you okay now it's revealed from first from fifth to fifth as it is written they just shall live by what so the judge shall live by faith is the message of who which is called justification and justification was your other code everybody okay so when you bring in somebody you must know which gate they're coming in when you open the gate they must first get into the present altar and after the president alter you bring them to the world of baptism before you move forward with them hallelujah now brother branham says this we talk about teaching and learning brother branham says this again brother obama said i believe the church is beginning to hear the message what were they hearing what were they hearing amen and begin to do water so somebody was hearing but they were not understanding amen but friend listen we get to lay in the presence of the sun we got to be ripened everybody okay our water is not water let me go back again our water is not water our water is not yet to rap you must enter in the presence of the sun the presence of the sun is where the pillar of fire is your faith here is still green [Music] did you follow me that faith need to go all the way there and rape [Music] amen amen lord have mercy intellectually do you hear me we are hearing the water how did you hear the message from your heart or from your head intellectually we are hearing the message that's why you try to impress people you're sitting and you say yes i remember when we were talking about the tabernacle and think things tomorrow you're a liar yeah i remember you know you know yes we went to a conference that whoa was so good they preached about the seven till tomorrow you with a woman at the hotel you were hearing the message intellectually intellectually we are hearing the message that god has given us and seeing the sounds that he showed us and prove it by the bible it's there but oh how the church need to lay in the presence till it does what you know and get what in the spirit so it can be water so teaching is not a problem learning is not a problem where do you learn and where do you get your understanding from this is what a problem is brother branham says this hallelujah brother branham says this he said he taught us the evidence of what would happen after being baptized with the holy ghost was that we would have the water come and teach all water but that teacher was an inside teacher okay on the other court you are exposed to the zodiac you are outside if it rains rain over there if he snow is not over there but the teacher is insane who is teaching you the message is the preacher teaching you the message of the holy ghost teaching you the message hallelujah nothing outside teacher if the spirit was not inside you would not hear the truth and receive it by water if you heard it every moment of the day 20 years in the message and leave the message he was not hearing the message intellectually he was receiving the message ever that was the son of the indwelling spirit in the days of power those who were filled with the water heard the word receive it and did what they never stop at the hearing the words that they receive become flesh [Music] brother stephen preach about where your skirt should be why is your skirt all the time here in church you're not hearing it's intellectually that you're receiving it all your skirts are right here every sister is here all your skirts are here and you're the only one hallelujah the brother branham said those who did not have the spirit they also heard it only as water intellectual and put water a wrong interpretation on it and went on water i didn't think brother stephen meant to that brother stephen meant what he preached it is your interpretation because of the lack of the holy ghost but here in every age of the holy ghost in every age and every age is the edge of the holy ghost for the true believer i say in every age the evidence was the same those who had the spirit the teacher heard the word and that spirit in them took the word and taught it in other words reveal it to them and they were of the group that heard the messenger and his message and took it and did what if you left that messenger of your day how are you hearing the message we gave too many people the holy ghost in this message because we have our own conception of the holy ghost everybody cares so far so as we begin to move on last sunday we found that we we stopped here in uh in the story of elijah and we know that israel was between two opinions the bible says that elijah came unto all the people and say how long hat you between two opinion if the lord be god follow him but if bear then follow him in other words somebody must make a decision either the message is right stick with the message if the message is wrong don't waste your time here [Music] this is not a church i'm going to pet you to stay here for your traveling you're in the wrong church i'm rocking you off so we can go to reverend everybody we're not looking for tithing here i'm working my friend everybody okay anybody okay either follow god or go to the way of bell and we found out that elijah restored the altar according to the president and according to the levin in other words elijah restored the altar according to the other court [Music] when israel was between two opinions when israel was not sure whether the message is right or not elijah brought the other culture [Music] [Applause] ever here i cannot waste my time with the holy place i cannot waste my time with the holy of holies what you need to go through is the other code because you gotta make a decision either you're going for god are you going for bear either you're gonna go for this world and cope with everything that goes into the world the world cut their hair a certain way you do it too they change you change they change you change who is giving you your information have you ever seen me changing my beard because i don't care what is on the outside i'm not waiting for them to change the view then i change mine and then tomorrow when the change has changed also i am on the outside you have a certain way you cut your hair stick to it i understand women have to change a little bit but do not copy after the world all the things of the world because if you love the world and the things of the world the love of god is not even in you fool yourself and know what the bible say people act like we don't know what the scriptures say are you have the holy ghost that's your own holy ghost not the one i know here you can fool yourself not me everybody okay so far so elijah pulled the other coat and he brought the two elements he brought the altar and he brought the level and when elijah prayed then the fire came down right here elijah brought to israel at 2 38 because only when the fire fell than the heart of israel when the fire fell than the heart of israel when the fire fell then the heart of israel was turned back to god everybody okay everybody okay so right here repent be baptized and then you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost act 2 38 presented by elijah to israel you got to come that way first before we enter into the deep of holy stuff here at the time of the evening sacrifice that's why you look at brother brother at the beginning he was preaching about healing and salvation healing and the holy ghost because what branham was presenting to people the other caught first before the opening of the seals down the road [Applause] brother didn't preach the seals in 47 he went away down there because the people need to grow up he was featured he was dealing with pentecostal babies the fire the bible said i indeed baptize you with water until repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than i whose you i'm not worthy to bear we already talk about that shoe he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and water it seems to hear like the holy ghost is different than the fire because matthew put a camera in luke the bible says john answered luke is a teacher saying unto them i indeed baptize you with water but one mario deny i come the largest of whose shoes i'm not worthy to lose he shall baptize you with the water luke didn't put the camera but he said the holy ghost said what luke put them together everybody okay now in act let's see what happened enough to do the bible says and suddenly there came a son from heaven as a rushing mighty wind and he filled out the house where they were sitting and then in the upper room appear unto them cloventon like of water and he sat upon each one of them and they were all filled with water so we found out here that when the holy ghost comes he comes with fire you got the holy ghost where is your fire oh i gathered without sensation mary got a pregnancy with her sensation but after a while we could see her barely going up your belly don't go up you didn't have a baby anybody here and they were all filled with the holy spirit and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance in other words the holy ghost sent the fire i won hallelujah brother problem say you have to watch the word fire because the holy ghost is used the holy ghost and fire because the holy ghost fire does what because that snake must be burnt out in justification the snake is there sanctification the snake is there that's why judah could move all the way here but when you get here the pillar of fire and the snake don't get along [Applause] the black dog and the white dog they don't get along [Applause] the light and the darkness don't get along when the light comes automatically the darkness have to go away [Music] hallelujah hallelujah science justify man salvation he justify man sanctify him send the holy ghost and fire and burn the sin out of him and dwelling him himself that is always god's judgment when he makes his final judgment there is a present altar here everybody okay there is a judgment here you remember but this judgment is not final there is a final judgment the final judgment to determine who is chosen by god is right here if you put your road there and your road come without anything you are not chosen the final judgment is in the holy place the holiest amen hallelujah amen that is always god's judgment when he makes his final judgment he calls you justify you and bring you to redemption anybody okay so you can get justified here but god have not given you his final judgment yet whether he agrees with you or not anybody here and then his judgment breaks forth upon you so you must reach a point after your justification that god comes with a judgment on you hallelujah and the holy water ghost and fire the water cleans away the sin then you are water so the final judgment have to put you on the holiest then god say this belongs to me relax amen what is going on when you go into the tabernacle hallelujah when you enter the other court we have two furniture there we got the altar and we got the lever as soon as you finish those two process then you finish with the other coat my friend on the uh computer make sure he stays there everybody okay then you have the second stage over there which is the holy place when you cross the holy place then you go to the holy stone over there everybody okay and right here in the other court at the present until we repent everybody okay i'm then going slowly lava we get our world of baptism everybody okay then later on you get the gift of the holy spirit this is act again 2 38 in the tabernacle at 238 in the tabernacle when you get in repent be baptized in the name of jesus christ and you shall receive the gift of the holy spirit the problem is this in between the other cut and the holy place there is a space there we have a measurement somewhere that is missing everybody okay so when we look at act 2 38 act is saying repent we got the first furniture act is saying that uh be baptized we got the second furniture then suddenly act of act 2 38 goes to the baptism of the holy spirit which make which jumpers all together to the holiest now we got a problem how where is the holy place into act 238 if you notice between the other court and the holiest blessing everybody clear there is a space of time that separates the two everybody okay that suffers of time in acts 2 38 is called shall everybody okay did i lose anybody did i lose anybody in other words repent be baptized in the name of jesus christ you will have a period of time of preparation shall the space of time receive the gift of the holy spirit did i lose anybody act 2 38 is there and brother branham said the other court was justification the holy place was sanctification and the holiest was the baptism of the holy spirit and according to ruth justification was what brother branham said he is called the church through justification call it through sanctification then fill it with the water and water he took it through a process this journey here from here all the way here is a process oh i gave my life to jesus christ i'm a christian you christian you don't listen to your parent you're still stubborn the bible say obey children obey your parents or you say i'm 18 i do anything i want to do so get out from the home you can't pay the bills get out from the home go pay your own bills you know you a team when you want to talk but you don't want to be 18 in paying the rent you don't want to be 18 in paying your car you don't want to be patient in paying your insurance when he comes to pay and show us mama when he comes to pay your rent to daddy when you come to pentecost you are broke but when he come to tell you what to do you are 18. be 18 in every play [Applause] take your own responsibility and be 18 years old [Music] you can't fix your bed you're 18. you're working a whole year they gave you your w-2 form you're not paying any a lot of bills in the home where did your money go you should be rich four years working you should be rich where did your money go 18 years old you know practically basically you know what i'm saying you said you see you follow me when you talk like this talk also with your pocket do you love me jesus loves me even if you don't love me [Applause] hallelujah he said that himself the holy spirit himself the son of god could dwell in human heart so the process is for god to come and dwell in you now he has to go through that before he can come in in other words god will never fill you with the holy ghost until you are cleaned up properly oh i speak in tongues i don't care [Music] pentecost are speaking tongues and they're dressing like devils lesbians speak in tongues how much sex you speak in tongues what can you prove them that can change them i'm fasting 10 days or you open up dogs for devils that's fine everybody okay so we found justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost is a process and according to ruth justification is roof deciding sanctification is roof serving the baptism of the holy ghost is roof resting everybody okay now roof left from the house of elimination from the camp and roof move on into her justification she got straight to the gate on the way going to judah and now we have roof ready roof and justification this is our sermon today ruth enter she have to meet the president to make a decision and to repent what is repentance we found last sunday that a that isaiah got into the temple and he recognized and acknowledged that he was a sinner what is to repent the brother branham say now what can we do if we want to receive this repent peter say brother branham say what is repent repent means to turn around in other words you are going toward the staff if you truly repented you cannot be on 85 staff anymore you got to be on 85 enough if you still going on 95 self you are fooling yourself what is repentance brother random say you was going with the world turn around and go up toward god now you are looking down this way look up this way repent run along with a big long face like this oh where bless god i have been in church for 40 years in a message then repent look up this way and say hallelujah there it is that is what you want to do to turn around to look what why do you still look the same hallelujah that is what you should do brother branham said the trouble of it you want to shake hand and sprinkle instead of repent and be baptized repent means turn around leave your belief behind start up on the road believing god toward water you are approaching the present altar now because you got to be killed this is not thought that's why you come to the altar don't change come to the altar don't change but here turn around start up the road and you will receive the baptism of the holy ghost you shall receive it's in the future remember the spacing brother problem continues he said and that is the reason i do use the word baptism in the name of jesus christ but not regeneration the pentecostal united pentecostal church baptized in the name of jesus christ for regeneration in other words the pentecostal are saying when they baptize you in water then you got your new birth brother brandon said that's wrong your new birth is over here i'm going with the pentecostal off everybody okay i don't believe that they can do that if they want to but i believe that peter said repent first water don't remit sin the church of christ preaches that way but i believe that repentance godly sorrow we already talk about this you don't come in the altar laughing the lamb doesn't go in the altar laughing and telling his friend hello goodbye and they're going to kill him he's going to the altered trembling everybody here repent means turn around go back you did what you missed the mark you must start over i was born in a message yes you must start over because your knowledge of servant self didn't take the sin of your life so you were intellectually receiving this hills everybody do that first and your baptism in order is only an honored profession of something that has been done inside that you have accepted christ as your water so when you approach the gate the proper way according to brother branham when ruth approaches here there is a repractis and repentance will follow with death everybody here a death of what the bible says i am crucified with christ this is paul christ was already crucified but you must be crucified now with christ you must die jesus christ nevertheless i live yet no time but christ lives within me because paul is dead and the life we can now live in the flesh that has the black dog i live it by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me knowing this that our old man is what do you see what i'm saying crucify with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin anymore and they that are christ have done what they flesh with the water and water but god forbid that i should glory save in the water of the lord jesus christ by whom the water the world is water and unto the water so when you entering into the other coat when you get to the president you are dying to the world you cannot move forward with the world your repentance is wrong you must go back again i'm going slowly everybody clear so far everybody clear so far let me pull this i don't know why this is playing games let's go to roof chapter one hallelujah how when you die at the altar what happened to you what is that death mean everybody here blessed be the name of the lord for those that are wondering about time my time is okay so chill out here before you know it somebody's up the beginning not your pastor amen roof chapter one you there let's go to verse 14. and they lift up their voice we are roof in justification everybody there is two aspects of justification there is justification of a person that's what i'm preaching today then we're going to get the justification of the age you don't put them together you mess out the coach together and you get confused i'm going with a person and with the age and you're going to get in the message and every coach you see you will travel like a fish in the water without any problem hey luke chapter 1 verse 14 and they lift up their voice roof and oppa and wept again remember this you already know and oppa kissed her mother-in-law but roof did water crank her and she said this is naomi behold your sister-in-law is gone back to her water so when orpah was going back oppa was not going back in the house that elimelech was living makes sense she was actually going back to the world when the people gave their back to the message don't be surprised if you begin to see them in paint wearing makeups and all kind of stuff because they think they are going back to the camp they are not they are going back to the origin she's going back to her people the more about back to the nomination and to her what god's object of worship brother branham say everything you put between you and god is a nado brother brother say your church can become an adult brother branham say a gift can become an adult and brother branham said they took the brazen serpent and they made it an adult here but i have a news for you even though the brazen serpent that moses lift up was made an arrow that didn't make moses a false prophet [Music] did you hear me did you hear me moses made the present serpent and the people begin to worship him but that didn't make moses a false prophet moses was still the prophet of god if somebody worship brother branham that is wrong but that doesn't make brother branham a wrong prophet brother brother is still a vindicator prophet of god [Music] [Applause] you don't play with this message hallelujah hallelujah return to your god after your sister-in-law she loved the things of the world verse 16 now rufus the president alter everybody okay ruffa the president alter we talk to you about the president although ruffa the present altar hallelujah ruff what is your decision roof said naomi i'm paraphrasing look me straight to the eyes everybody me not in other words don't get on my way move out of my way don't try to block me you can't help me entreat me not to leave you or return from following after you in other words don't push me anymore stop this pushing now i am a different specie i am the rainbow trout i am not a person that backup when i made up my mind to leave the house of elimination i am going all the way. [Music] [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah i know that my mama is there i know that my dad is there i'm not the house of my daddy but you saw me following you so i am not playing games [Music] hallelujah oh my god you ready for where you go where was naomi going destination judah where jedusa and the jews are the christian according to paul the inward jews everybody okay where you go i will

discuss with me i already put my destination you do what you're supposed to do in other words keep moving hallelujah where you go i would go everybody there and where you water where is she going to lodge in bethlehem where christ is going to be born ever here at the place of birth of my savior there i will stay everybody here so when the gps you naomi when you tell me you have arrived that's where i'm gonna stay anybody clear where you go there i will go this country here is the country the country of israel anybody care where you go i will go where you launch our lodge everybody okay your people who else those people the jews your people the jews become my people in other words i am changing my citizenship right here everybody here your people will be my people but i am not limited only to the location to the place and to the people i want to go a little bit further naomi and let you know that not only the press not only the location not only the people that are there but your god your god i'm now climbing higher i get in the land to the location then to the people then to god destination your god will be my god not our god naomi not your god naomi will be our god it is not a collective he is your god now that god needs to be my god hallelujah can i continue verse 17 where you die roof my god where you die the death where you die everybody okay i would die did she finish and there will ya be buried death bearer brother robert is betraying me something is missing [Music] something is missing right something is missing remember she's going in which land the land of judah the land of judah had a mystery everybody okay and that mystery started with abraham everybody here and the one who really started it was job [Music] are you following me job went through his trial and at the summit of his trial job looked up and the vision broke up and john job said wow i know my redeemer job was in the time of nimrod before abraham but he saw the redeemer job said i know my redeemer lives and i will see him in the last day dawg the skin worm destroy this body yet me job in the same flesh i will rise again and i will see my redeemer so job spoke about the resurrection and he died and they took him and they bury him somewhere everybody okay abraham came back here and for some reason sarah died abraham looked and there was a portion of the land that attracted abraham abraham say i need to get that place over there that mystery only a prophet can unfold to you brother branham say what abraham was looking was the place where job was buried everybody here so abraham got that place and he said sarah i'm gonna bury you with this man here are you okay later on the whole land became the land of judah everybody okay so when jacob left him and went to egypt and said john in egypt before the death of jacob he said call me joseph joseph come here if i die don't bury me in egypt take my but take my casket back to the promised land go where abraham was buried god put me there everybody okay and joseph grew up and before he died joseph called it the brother he said come here come here listen to me i am dead i'm a prophet i'm gonna die actually when i'm die okay momentarily you keep me here because you gotta watch over my bone okay i was a great man they're not gonna let me they're not gonna let you pick me up because they want to keep me here before everything i did for egypt but there will come a day that god will send you somebody the lord will visit you and will take you out of here at that time there won't be a pharaoh that would neglect me he won't carry a bat he won't worry about my casket anymore he won't know the value of the prophet anymore at that time when you go out remember me ever here go back to pharaoh's tomb take my casket out if you're sleeping you can stand up back there take your cash casket out and take me to the promised land and bury me there why are these people want to be buried in the promised land everybody what happened is when the veil was split and jesus screamed everybody that was a scent that was buried in paradise resurrected everybody here so when roof is saying where you die i'm gonna die there and i'm gonna be buried there roof also identified with abraham with jacob with job with joseph [Music] ever here when you bury me then ruth knew that i won't be resurrected rule for meeting the resurrection because it's a mystery where you die i will be there i will die when you bury i will be buried because the resurrection will be there the death the burial and the resurrection is all symbolized by the water baptism roof at the level did i lose somebody so right here roof at the present altar and ruth at the alt at the at the delivery where you go i go your people will be my people your god will be my god in other words wolf was separating herself completely with her country of origin or her country of natural birth i wish i have time sometimes you have to separate from everything that is dear on earth she's going to leave her father she's going to leave her mother she's going to leave her uncle she's going to leave everything like abraham did and she's going alone not a family member abraham pick up a lot she didn't pick nobody everybody everything that is there on earth to you to take your position that god has called you to it will cost you something my friend this altar is not a game it's going to cost you your friends he will even cost you some message believer because you don't want to cope with them anymore because you realize they were not a good influence you hang out with them a lot you don't progress ever here i am sure you can read between the line what i'm saying sometimes the very dearest person on earth you have to shake hand with them and take your position in christ to where god has called you but what is god doing here he's transforming you remember the tabernacle from what you will's roof may be a daughter or a son or whatever it is from a lovely family sometime roof he places you somewhere else roof because it is his way of doing it by renewing off your water to obey the word regardless of what the price is do you see what repentance is hallelujah brother branham say roof a top of a believer now what what is the believer when she or he comes out the person from the world he comes in among christian believers women that used to smoke drink and play god at society and so forth and have all kind of fancy stuff and like some kind of freeze-up birds but now she's changed she made the decision to go with god now she comes into a people that does not believe that kind of stuff she's a stranger she gets to work as a program she doesn't know their custom they are all strange to her she don't know what to do that's what roof had to do that is what you have to do that is what i have to do myself where are you going brother stephen when i accepted christ i was turned out of my home my own home when i accepted christ my boyfriend girlfriend everybody threw me down went down with a bunch of old people that had the holy spirit and believed in god serving him the girl was down there in that church was different than the girl i have been going with they look different they act different they were strange and i was scared of them they were different when you get the first time in a message church if you're coming from the world you look like you dirty everybody is just like this in the church that is what roof had to do she had to come from her own offer to another people she was converted she made a decision and you make a decision you gotta take your choice [Music] ruth say that my your people will be my people what is wrong with that one brother branham saying why don't the christian women wear those clothes like the other women do say we are all american are we i say no sir because when you are born when you are at the brazen otter you must reject your country of origin if you coming from africa you gotta live the behavior of africans you gotta die to africa you gotta die to europe you gotta die to america you gotta die from your country of origin why do you still behave the way you behave god said be on time in church a strain from your country are late you need to be dead to that [Music] what are we i said we are neither german nor water nor what no what no what oh what we are none of them this church is not an american church this church is not an african church this church is not a european church this church is the church of the living god a church on the merchandise deck from every country every tribe every language so don't push your way here you gotta die to your way we have one head that's the message of the hour what are we i say we are christian why american act like american german act like water because that is the water but we have a national spirit that is the water coming from water out of water and you act like water make you conduct yourself as they do up because you are of another [Applause] your people will be my people that people is not african that people is not american that people is not latino that people is not european they're not canadian they are christian hallelujah where you say honey you see each nation leave off on the spirit of the nation that's their national spirit she said well would it not be wouldn't we be living on the american spirit i say oh no we are born again we live on heavenly spirit where and what we are not american as far as that goes because american is just a nerfly nation and every nation sooner is going to be destroyed every kingdom there is a stone that came out of the mountain without the help of any hand it's going to destroy every kingdom and that's the kingdom that's going to stay forever hallelujah but when a man of german a man of sweden or wherever he may be when he become born of heaven he takes on the heavenly spirit his nature his makeup look for the principle where christ set at the right hand of god how we ought to remember that that he died that we might be able to be fortified from this thing inoculated that is right [Music] what is your behavior are you behaving like a christian or are you behaving like an american are you behaving like a christian or are you behaving like an african are you behaving like a christian or are you behaving like a european because there is only one message but that message goes to every country the same message i'm reading here people are reading that in south america they're reading that in canada in canada they're reading that in europe it's not a different message they just change the language but they keep the message the same so that if i meet a brother from russia a brother from ukraine if we sit together we can eat and talk and fellowship like we've seen each other for a long time [Music] but here anybody care what is converted you okay this thing is loaded buddy we talk about someone peter having faith but that faith without conversion conversion is a tricky word and you need to be understood right brother uh uh in psalm 51 david say then will that teach transgressor that way they need to teach them and sinner shall be converted unto thee many times we came from pentecost and we were taught that conversion means when you go to the altar you sit down you ask for forgiveness you wake up and you say you will hear them saying i'm converted i'm a christian now that's not correct because peter have faith but jesus told him when you are converted so he was not converted yet even though he could do all of this and pentecostal when they reach here they do this they can live any kind of life as long as the anointing is going on then they fell under the anointing one at the end time even in this message we have anyway matthew 18 verily i say unto you except he be converted and become as leader children now converted you have to become like a child how many were converted today you still adult you do what you want to do regardless anybody care you shall not enter in the kingdom of heaven repent ye therefore and be what i thought to repent and converted into the same thing now now the bible said repent therefore karma and be what everybody here that your sin may be blooded out when the time of what you need to understand what is refreshing [Music] in isaiah 28 the bible says with stammering lips with strangling lips and another tongue you unders you see that speaking in tongues either stammering speaking in tongue another one will speak like a language the two of them with stammering lips and another tongue with us speak to these people to whom he said this is the what but we know the rest is where everybody okay rest when we may cause the weary to do what and this is the word so the refreshing is the holy ghost which brings the rest of god so when the holy ghost come you are completely off from the sin god get into your chair and get the palate of your life everybody here so be converted when when the time of refreshing when the holy ghost come oh brother branham come on in now we take the wrong in the word of conversion today we say that a man that is converted is a man that stopped drinking and everything and goes to church or joined the church he might join the church but that is no son he is what let that soak him he is not converted until his old life is what and his what and his what in the water of the newness of life when the water has created in him a living hope of eternal life which only come through the world peter peter not when you believe on me when you are converted when you're gonna go get the holy spirit that's when you can strengthen the brother not at this time because peter could cast she's making me so bad mad i'm so angry that if i don't control myself i can even speak bad things off my mouth you are not converted just that speech you are not converted don't fool yourself [Music] watch the language you're using it is showing you where you are everybody here he that believeth upon me now the scripture said that no man can say jesus is christ only by the water so you cannot believe that jesus is christ you can do it intellectually until you have received the baptism of the holy ghost you are only testifying or saying what the scripture says [Music] saying what the pastor says saying what mother say and some good preachers say but you don't know it yourself until he has witnessed his resurrection to you no man can call jesus the cross until by the water so when you say i believe jesus christ i believe jesus christ you're just repeating what you heard in church when you really believe in jesus christ peter say you are the christ the son of the living god and jesus looked at him he said when you gonna get converted sorry i gotta rock that boat i hate snakes i believe then now i believe then that a man is saved when he believes on the lord jesus christ with all his heart and from his heart not from the outside conscience put your seat belt because it's going to rock you bad now the next question is it true that you are not saved unless you receive the holy ghost you see why i have to preach the way i preach there could be about a good five hour i'm not gonna do that my battery was seven point something discussion on that when you accept christ as your savior and are then ready for baptism in order you will have not yet been converted you are only believing unto what everybody okay how many have the holy ghost conversion means to be hallelujah amen peter had been justified and believe on the lord jesus christ he even preached the gospel but jesus told him after you are converted then strengthen your brother after you are conversion conversion is the holy spirit that moves the old nature out the snake and the new nature the white dog comes in which is the holy ghost and when a man has truly born that has truly been born of the spirit of god he has everlasting life he that he with my word and believe on him that sent me not man can say it except by the water in other words that believing have to come from the holy ghost brother stephen i'm confused relax peter jesus told peter the night of the betrayal he was already what peter was water that's why jesus said i prayed for what this thing is a problem i let it soak but brother stephen he was already saved what else do we need relax he was already safe now after you are converted strengthen your water that's right you accept christ as your savior but when you are converted is when you are really changed that's right you have you was not changed yet he cursed before the lord save cursing snake still living in you understand now you understand why you acted the way you at why you clock the door or you snap the door to mama why you show people finger on the highway and you turn around you say i'm sorry lord but he already got it not converted have a snake in you he cursed before the lord and deny him and everything but after his conversion after that are converted strengthen the brother that is what the scripture says anyone that makes it right jesus told peter that he had followed him he cast out devils he done miracle and everything you are not converted yet but after you are converted then strengthen your breathing jesus christ what's going on do you believe that god give the holy spirit to everyone that is truly born again christian at the time they accept salvation or do you believe that this is a different work of grace that in that in the experience of most christians come later please clarify this subject as many are what because of the different water somebody saying when you are at the altar i have a question do we receive the holy spirit here or the holy spirit is separate from this one why because of the teaching you received the message you already received the baptism of the holy ghost sleeping with women on the hotel that holy ghost doesn't stop you it's enjoying sin that's not the holy ghost now christian friend a person cannot be born again until they have received the holy spirit you can you are not even converted until you received i am not saying you are lost i'm praying for you but when you are the message is perfectly aligned with the scripture relax if i let you go read this stuff you're going to be puzzled left and right you don't understand what you mean by the problem say here but what i'm saying it's a confusion and back here it is not a confusion i'm not saying you are lost before you receive the holy ghost because you are not there is three there is one work of grace only one work of grace that is the holy spirit and it's made in three manifestations just like there is one god made in three manifestation father son holy spirit one god only what there is the three works of grace but through manifestation there is a manifestation of justification by water brother branham is saying the tabernacle here is one tabernacle but he have three parts and back here all three parts belong to the tabernacle but to really make sure that you really are inside the tabernacle the final judgment comes with the last portion because people got here like judah people got here like judah ever here but when pentecost come they fell off so that shows that the faith of judah was wrong everybody here for your faith to be acknowledged that you were not lost that faith needs to be sanctioned by god can i repeat it again this is what i'm saying somebody let's call this one this is two this is three okay for you to know truly that your one was good you must have the tree if you have one and two and never had three something is wrong if you give me time you're going to see that in your scripture yourself hallelujah there is a manifestation of justification by faith a man believe god say yes sir i believe that i believe there is a true god and now for my personal savior i accepted jesus christ he is the son his son as my personal savior now that is what is called by faith which the disciple received what and judah got into this one because the bible said the devil believes by the tremble you need to be careful now which faith did you receive was that a faith from the heart or was it an intellectual faith because but faith can move on into the tabernacle i'm going to go slow lord help me the next thing is the man will go out the men that got justified will go out today he must smoke the snake is there remember drink curse do things that his habit is hanging into him it's just rooted in there it's spirit habits are what the bible said they are unclean spirit in men maybe he is lustful excuse this we are in a mixed audience but we are standing in the judgment house of god and we must say these things clear for instance men sometimes especially men become lustful sex maniac and not only that but just lustful way women dress and everything today no wonder they are you drive them crazy the woman becomes the same way lustful spirit get on them and they are nice little what these people are nice they just got to the altar but the habits are there because the snake is still moving on the other coat everybody here the clean conscience took the guiltiness away but the snake is still pumping them so they still are tempted if if brother branham prayed for a woman and the woman was delivered and one day the woman was passing and just heard the song and stop and the song could tempt her and the devil got into her again because the woman was not yet into the inside you are subject to spirit everybody okay and they'll put on short clothing so if you were in short clothing in this church after all that we preach you know where you are whether you're married or you're not married anybody here they put on little bitty things around them that looks horrible why they don't want to be bad something is here already want to leave for christ but the black dog is pressuring and they don't know how to fight him they're just going by the i'm sorry lord that didn't mean that so he's still tempting he's under justification he's in the altar the snake is still alive everybody okay but they don't realize that that old passion demon spirit is what because on the inside the snake is there everybody okay they don't do that to appear before god they do it not to be cool in other words they do it with the wrong motive it's a spirit that got on him it's a habit he doesn't want to do that to be bad in his heart i don't want to do it lord i don't want to do it i don't want to do it i don't want to do it tomorrow i won't do it again i won't look at that pornography again then tomorrow and when as soon as he's his hand out on the computer he's watching who's around he closes the door and he feels like i need to get off the computer you are in a justified state you are not born again yet hallelujah hallelujah roof and justification brother branham remember that when you are justified by faith now you are a christian right then everybody okay when you accept jesus as your personal savior you are a christian at that time that's right i believe if you die right then do you follow me when you accept jesus as your savior i believe like you are saved that is what the dying fifth at the cross was follow me carefully maybe i'm gonna stop somewhere here christ yeah i got to stop here you okay when you get into the adequate and you do what you're supposed to do here and you are dead to your sin you accepted jesus christ ever here your guilty conscience is gone brother branham say you got faith now remember peter you believe on jesus christ you are saved you are not converted yet everybody because the snake is there if you die right there at the altar you're going to heaven relax now let me pull the trigger what about if i didn't die brother stephen before you put it in the box the question is that a man is saved i believe if he's looking towards recovery and die in daddy's state brother branham is only insisting when you get in the altar and death struck you in other words you give your life now you leave you get in the correct boom you go into heaven listen to me carefully because you already did it a long time so that option is different now certainly i believe he shall be saved i believe he got through if he had not what 20 years justify something is wrong something is wrong are you there but depend you go back to the dying fifa the cross but remember that was his what and what that's why god pick him up quickly by amazing grace but you that's not the same case you never died when you come to the altar that's a problem right there let me get this on my land you go one night don't wait till that time because it might not be that way for you you might not have a deathbed confession somebody is a sinner brother stephen get the deacon he's my grandpa let's go to the hospital we get there he's there were you smoking yes are you doing this they're going to pull the machine do you accept jesus christ as your savior do you want to do this do you want to do this quickly we bring the berries in altar not the seven seal the brazen altar quickly you need to be praised ready if he'd say yes lord forgive me tell my wife i'm sorry for the way i treated her i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry and suddenly straight to heaven that was his first time and last time no other opportunity when we get to justification in the edge it's going to answer that question you have there everybody here hallelujah i tell you they are all right but there are too much of a chance to take a chance on don't wait for deathbed you let this be your deathbed right now that you die out now and be born again off the water don't wait because you don't know if it's going to happen to you oh my god everybody here because it it takes right back to this day when the fifth was hanging on the cross and he died without being baptized at all about here so the man we went to the hospital with brother kelly the man is dying we could not take him from rcu and put him in a lava to baptize him he's going to heaven god is rescuing the seed by amazing grace he pulled the emergency bullet he put it in and said devil get your hand off whether you're there or not i'm gonna take him that's it everybody here now and he died without being baptized at all and yet with a promise that jesus will meet him in the paradise that day in paradise not in the region of the lost why because it was the the opportunity was what what about you now and then i stop hallelujah if a man ever comes to a spot that he has been saved like peter saved everybody okay and what you moved on here now hey the blood sanctified hebrew 13 12 and 13 says the blood sanctified and then come right up to the gate of the baptism of the holy ghost and because of what or what he refused to do what that person is what and what when i will get to marriage i'm going to show you how it applied to marriage also this goes with marriage when i show you the three room in marriage they can kick you out those that were yesterday pick up some of them ever here that person can never be saved for he has done despite even the very work of grace that calls him up to that place and shown it to him and then turn around and walk away from it because it's one work one spirit but that spirit pick you up and pull you to the altar when you alter he get baptized you when you baptize he pull you to another state so when he open you cannot stay where you are you follow me you gotta move on as he's moving you hallelujah he can't the blood of the covenant where if he was crucified as a holy thing because the blood does save him and justify him and sanctify him bring him up to the baptism of the holy ghost and then he walk away and leave it it's not your first and your last opportunity brother branham if possible for a person to be lost and end up in hell if he reject the light of the world even though he has genuine experience of justification and what yes sir that's exactly right what are we saying what are we saying where are you in the tabernacle because when you stop you die i'm gonna show you that in the ages everybody once you get here if it's your first and last opportunity you're dead god pick you up but if you're not dead and you're going home you need to be very careful because god didn't justify you for gamer the purpose is to clean you up now you need to move forward and start cleaning we will get to roof serving now and back here when you stop moving that way you need to move all the way when you get to the serving and god finishes with you god himself will open the third one and if you start belittling the spirit and playing with the supernatural you need to be very careful because it's a door that god is opening now for you to get in and to jump into it if you are dead spare but if you're alive as long as the light unfolded you have to keep moving with the light all the way the only place you can stop and you rest is when number three have come and sanction you then there is nothing else to do you take your hand off your car is in neutral and somebody else begin to drag you in the entire life then you do something wrong somebody tell you go back and repent go back and correct it go back and fix it with your wife i'm sorry she talked bad to me you need to go back and do it again everybody you don't want it and he paralyzed your body you go and something struck you pop a car boom and when something happened an accident i'm sorry lord i need to go fix that problem quickly because somebody now is taking over peter have the faith not converted yet he could do all the supernatural by the same thing he could also curse you can sing like an angel and you can live like a devil let's stand there let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly father this afternoon lord thanking you for your grace for your love and for your mercy lord if it was not for the mercies of god we will be also being confused completely and being in the babylon because this thing the devil wanted to be confused so that your children will be confused and they don't know where they are while the coming of the lord is so imminent that one of these days you are coming to pick up your bride father we have unfolded the roof through grace we have unfolded roof through the tabernacle we have unfolded roof at the brazen altar and today we have unfolded a portion of roof in justification at the brazen altar we still have to go through justification in the liver before we move on through the age father but i believe enough is spoken already that your children might recognize where they are if they are in the tabernacle or they are not in the tabernacle if they are in a justified state or they already passed that justified state if they are under uh sanctification and they are not in the holy of holies or if they already have the holy the holiest experience and now they are just resting preparing for the abduction father this is not an intellectual teaching this is something that you unfolded because you spoke in your word that you shall know the truth and the truth has set you free and this truth has been revealed lord through this message not to feed us with our intellectual but father to set us free because he that the son have set free is truly is free indeed and father if there is anybody any young man or any parent or any married couple they have not seen the importance of their christian life and that still give themselves to the things of the world because they're after their own objective their own agenda their own project despite everything that is happening in the world father they're not paying attention much to the faints of the spirit until they become even non-sensible father to the speaking of the spirit lord may your grace and your mercy come down and may you touch them may you shake them lord with a hand of grace so that they can wake up and realize where they are and if they miss a step may they go straight to that altar and fix it and die to their own country and die to their own tradition and die to their own family and die to their own friend and die to their own clique they've been so long in these years lord and father make sure that you the god of this message you become their personal god and father if something happened and they be buried today they are going with the hope of eternal life knowing lord father that one of this day they will rise up and meet you in the air lord i commit everything unto the hand and i commit their families unto the hand may you continue to protect us and may you take this word that has been spoken lord and may you unfold it more and more until lord father they can ruminate on these things and father come to the realization that this is not a plain time it's homegoing time father i pray and i commit everything unto the hand and ask it in the name of jesus christ amen [Music] there is a man if you can help me in prayer who has been streaming our service from india his dad is having a problem in the eyes extreme pain in the eyes and from india he's sending a prayer request so if we can pray for him heavenly father lord you know exactly what's going to happen today and that

heavenly into the laying of hand but father wherever he is lord we pray in the name of jesus christ that the blood of the lamb that was shed on calvary and because of your strap your children were here may you touch that man in the supernatural power of the holy spirit and may you heal him for the glory of your name lord father we commit a man to the hand lord may you let lord father whatever
