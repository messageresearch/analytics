[52:40] anybody behind
[52:44] everybody on page with the sermon
[52:46] if you're behind that's your problem
[52:49] anybody behind them
[52:51] okay blessed be the name of the lord
[52:55] our origin
[52:57] amen
[52:59] i told you i'm going to preach on
[53:00] predestination
[53:02] so that's predestination right there
[53:04] if not you won't understand the lake of
[53:07] fire
[53:08] let's go straight to our scripture in
[53:10] psalm chapter
[53:12] 69 brother david
[53:15] just a little bit so i can blast to that
[53:18] devil
[53:23] amen
[53:25] you got trained you got me trained on
[53:28] the bazooka
[53:34] amen
[53:38] psalm 69
[53:42] if you're there you can say amen
[53:46] a few pages turning
[53:49] when i give you scripture
[53:52] it's not for you to
[53:53] look at them today and forget about him
[53:57] amen
[53:58] you need to be grounded in the word of
[54:00] god amen
[54:02] when i give scripture when we're going
[54:03] through a series you make sure you go
[54:05] home and put those scriptures for
[54:07] yourself
[54:08] so if anything happen in the future you
[54:10] have a reference you can defend your
[54:13] faith yourself not the pastor say
[54:16] the bible say the bible say brother
[54:18] branham say the bible say what brother
[54:21] say if you don't create a habit of
[54:23] sitting down and writing your scripture
[54:26] before you know it after three four
[54:27] months you will be looking for that
[54:29] scripture and you say but stephen when
[54:30] did you preach so-and-so and it's maybe
[54:33] part 43 part 46 and i have to search all
[54:37] over together so make sure especially
[54:40] the young people sit down and say we
[54:42] went through uh earrings this is a
[54:45] scripture about hearing we went through
[54:47] makeup this is the scripture about
[54:49] makeup we went through this and you put
[54:51] it together we went through uh how young
[54:54] how a young man should behave you put it
[54:56] together so you put it for yourself
[54:58] because if the lord terry you're gonna
[55:00] have a family you need to teach it to
[55:02] your children it was not moses
[55:04] responsibility to go to the houses of
[55:06] the people and begin to teach them you
[55:08] did it you need to do it for yourself so
[55:10] when you talk to somebody a co-worker or
[55:12] someone at work or auntie or uncle or
[55:15] grandpa you can sit down and say grandpa
[55:17] open your bible
[55:19] look here look here look here look here
[55:22] before you know it where do you pray how
[55:24] do you know all of this
[55:26] and you say god send us ah
[55:29] [Music]
[55:31] that's it
[55:33] amen because the message is perfectly in
[55:37] line
[55:38] with the scripture everybody clear even
[55:40] though it looks like you didn't see it
[55:42] today just chill out
[55:44] you're going to see it
[55:45] right here amen you saw it multiple
[55:48] times here psalm chapter 69 verse 22
[55:53] let their table
[55:55] become a snare
[55:57] in other words they're trapped
[55:59] what a prayer david
[56:01] he's praying for somebody they're
[56:02] terrible to become a trump to them
[56:05] my god
[56:06] let their table become a snare before
[56:08] them
[56:09] and that which should have been
[56:12] for their welfare let it become a trap
[56:16] why are you praying like this david
[56:19] you might be seated
[56:21] we should be praying for our enemies
[56:24] we should be praying that the lord need
[56:26] to save them
[56:29] amen father save them bring them to the
[56:32] kingdom but for some reason david is not
[56:34] praying like that
[56:36] david is praying for judgment
[56:43] is it okay brother david
[56:45] the bazooka
[56:47] okay you want me switch right
[56:49] that's it he's in trouble again
[56:54] so just bear with us until they get
[56:55] disadjusted pretty good
[57:23] amen
[57:25] that sounds pretty good
[57:28] amen
[57:29] now i'm home
[57:31] praise be the name of the lord
[57:33] hallelujah
[57:35] but david calls it not me
[57:38] so he said let their eyes be darkened
[57:41] david what's wrong
[57:44] not you david david in the bible
[57:47] amen
[57:49] let their eyes be darkened
[57:52] that they see not i thought you should
[57:54] pray for somebody so that the lord can
[57:56] enlighten them so that they can see but
[57:59] this can't this category david say
[58:03] blind them
[58:06] amen
[58:07] you need to know the scripture
[58:10] let their eyes be darkened
[58:12] that they see not
[58:14] and make their lawns continually to
[58:17] shake
[58:18] david
[58:20] 24 pour out your indignation in other
[58:24] words your wrath
[58:26] upon them
[58:28] and let your wrathful anger take hold of
[58:31] them why
[58:34] you should pray for your enemy
[58:37] amen
[58:39] let their habitation
[58:42] be desolate
[58:45] and let none dwell in their tents
[58:50] why
[58:51] 26
[58:52] 4
[58:53] they persecute him
[58:56] whom you have smitten
[58:58] because remember christ was smitten of
[59:01] god
[59:02] it's in the book of isaiah they
[59:04] persecuted him whom you have smitten
[59:08] and they talked to the grief of those
[59:12] whom you have wounded they begin to
[59:14] criticize them they didn't know what god
[59:17] was doing
[59:18] amen
[59:19] david continued he said add iniquity
[59:24] to their iniquity
[59:26] they knew better add it double it
[59:31] what kind of prayer
[59:33] and let them not come in your
[59:36] righteousness
[59:38] remember the psalm our prophecy
[59:41] so he's prophesying for somebody
[59:43] and if he's prophesying men of old
[59:46] spoke when they were moved by her
[59:49] so who's actually bringing that
[59:51] [Music]
[59:52] the holy spirit
[59:57] not really david it is the anointing of
[1:00:00] god upon david
[1:00:02] add iniquity to their iniquity they knew
[1:00:04] better add it
[1:00:06] and let them not to uh let them not come
[1:00:09] into righteousness
[1:00:11] in other words don't give them the way
[1:00:14] to be saved
[1:00:18] 28 let them be water
[1:00:22] out of the book of the water
[1:00:25] so these people
[1:00:27] were in the book of life
[1:00:37] so in other words the book of life
[1:00:43] everybody clear
[1:00:45] have a mix
[1:00:47] a mixture of seed
[1:00:51] amen
[1:00:52] remember there was one field in matthew
[1:00:55] 3rd uh in matthew 13
[1:00:59] god wanted the son of man and saw his
[1:01:01] seed but the enemy also came and put it
[1:01:04] together so we found out that in the
[1:01:06] camp of god now there is a mixture
[1:01:09] remember where we are in the mix what
[1:01:11] multitude
[1:01:13] not outside
[1:01:14] inside israel not all israelia is
[1:01:18] remember last sunday
[1:01:20] so not everybody does in the that is in
[1:01:23] the book of life is the child of god
[1:01:28] even though they're in the book of life
[1:01:32] except in the section
[1:01:34] called the lamb's book of life over
[1:01:38] there that's a different story
[1:01:40] but we're gonna get there
[1:01:42] if you look you can understand that we
[1:01:44] are traveling the book of life because
[1:01:47] the book of life really didn't start
[1:01:49] here it started way back
[1:01:51] in eternity amen
[1:01:54] let them be bloated out of the book of
[1:01:57] the living
[1:01:58] and not be written with the water
[1:02:02] so in the story of the book of life
[1:02:06] the story of the book of life
[1:02:10] ever clear
[1:02:12] the book of life
[1:02:14] that story
[1:02:15] contain the just
[1:02:19] and
[1:02:20] and the unjust
[1:02:23] anybody clear
[1:02:24] so when you read that book
[1:02:26] you must say and moses
[1:02:30] everybody here
[1:02:32] but that book cannot stop at moses
[1:02:36] he have to bring you balaam
[1:02:42] make sense
[1:02:44] if you say moses
[1:02:46] that book automatically have to bring
[1:02:49] quora
[1:02:52] you okay
[1:02:54] make sense
[1:02:56] make sense
[1:02:57] but truly when this book was written
[1:03:01] he was written
[1:03:03] almost like he have blank space
[1:03:10] are we okay
[1:03:11] in other words when god have to say he's
[1:03:14] gonna be like and moses did this this
[1:03:17] this blank space this this then joshua
[1:03:21] then this this this
[1:03:24] and those blank space had to be filled
[1:03:29] are we okay
[1:03:30] are we okay
[1:03:32] and anybody that was filled on the blank
[1:03:35] space
[1:03:36] can be erased
[1:03:43] we're good
[1:03:44] let them be blooded out of the book of
[1:03:47] the living
[1:03:48] and not be written with the righteous
[1:03:51] so the righteous in their book it's not
[1:03:54] only about the righteous it is the
[1:03:56] righteous and those that are not
[1:03:58] righteous they are there that's the one
[1:04:00] david is saying let the wrath of god be
[1:04:03] upon them
[1:04:04] turn them blind let not see the way of
[1:04:07] life i want you to remove them
[1:04:09] completely block them completely out why
[1:04:12] does david want to remove them from the
[1:04:14] book of life
[1:04:17] instead of being being saved let's go to
[1:04:19] matthew 13.
[1:04:24] remember the vessels of wrath
[1:04:26] and the vessels of water
[1:04:29] mercy
[1:04:30] we already got the vessels of mercy now
[1:04:33] we're dropping down deep
[1:04:35] amen
[1:04:38] hallelujah this is the message of the
[1:04:42] hour
[1:04:43] if you dare you can say amen
[1:04:46] few people
[1:04:48] okay i'm looking at you
[1:04:51] amen
[1:04:52] blaze said be the name of the lord
[1:04:55] who has ears
[1:04:58] to hear
[1:04:59] let him do water
[1:05:02] who doesn't have ear in this place
[1:05:08] everybody heaven
[1:05:10] so how can god say
[1:05:12] whom they have ears
[1:05:15] because when you created
[1:05:17] except if something is wrong
[1:05:20] maybe with the genetics or something in
[1:05:22] the pregnancy then you can end up not
[1:05:25] being having maybe these things right
[1:05:27] here everybody here but normally as a
[1:05:30] normal human being when you are born
[1:05:33] automatically you have an ear everybody
[1:05:36] has it
[1:05:37] but how can god say let him die have a
[1:05:40] mirror
[1:05:41] that ear is not this one
[1:05:45] everybody have this one
[1:05:48] but they don't have the other ear
[1:05:54] amen
[1:05:57] if you don't have that ear
[1:05:59] when god say
[1:06:01] sit down
[1:06:02] you will understand sit down
[1:06:05] but somebody else understands stand up
[1:06:16] who has ears to hear
[1:06:19] let him hear
[1:06:21] and the disciple came and said to him
[1:06:24] why speak you to them in what
[1:06:29] why are you speaking them in coding why
[1:06:32] are you joking why are you not just
[1:06:34] playing
[1:06:35] just say i'm hungry
[1:06:38] you just have to say uh
[1:06:40] i feel a little bit tired
[1:06:44] and everybody will hear i feel a little
[1:06:46] bit tired
[1:06:47] and you'll see the bride rising up
[1:06:50] and begin to prepare the meal
[1:06:53] she understood something that you didn't
[1:06:57] you were sitting right there you heard
[1:06:59] it but the wife understood that my
[1:07:01] husband is hungry
[1:07:05] if you ask her what did you hear
[1:07:08] i feel a little bit tired what did you
[1:07:10] hear i feel a little bit tired but her
[1:07:13] earring put her into a different
[1:07:16] behavior
[1:07:20] yet both of you heard
[1:07:24] and you see somebody sitting and trying
[1:07:26] to figure it out what did he really mean
[1:07:30] you need to have that ear
[1:07:33] he answered verse 11 and say to them
[1:07:36] because
[1:07:38] it is given to you
[1:07:42] know the water
[1:07:44] no no no no no don't preach mysteries
[1:07:53] motivational speakers
[1:07:57] because it is given to you to know what
[1:08:02] the mysteries are the hidden truth
[1:08:06] of the kingdom of heaven
[1:08:08] but to them it is not water
[1:08:11] so it doesn't belong to them
[1:08:14] that's why it must be put in symbols
[1:08:17] it must be coded
[1:08:21] anybody
[1:08:22] clear for whosoever has
[1:08:26] to him shall be given so you must have
[1:08:28] something
[1:08:30] you must have that love of the truth
[1:08:32] remember second thessalonians
[1:08:35] amen
[1:08:36] and he that have more
[1:08:38] and and he shall have more abundance
[1:08:42] but whosoever has what
[1:08:44] so there are certain people that does
[1:08:46] that they don't have anything
[1:08:48] that's why brother branham say in
[1:08:50] non-seed
[1:08:53] there is nothing to quicken
[1:08:56] amen they are giving to the one who
[1:08:58] already have something
[1:09:00] amen because the top of the china
[1:09:04] laundry man
[1:09:05] amen they have to tear the pepper in two
[1:09:08] one stay up there and you drop down with
[1:09:11] one
[1:09:12] if you have a portion of the pepper then
[1:09:16] they can give you something but if they
[1:09:18] check you there is no portion
[1:09:24] watch what happened
[1:09:26] and but whosoever has not
[1:09:29] from him shall be water
[1:09:31] taken away even water so he has
[1:09:35] something
[1:09:39] make sense now he has something in the
[1:09:42] book of life
[1:09:43] but because he has not
[1:09:47] they have to even remove him from the
[1:09:50] book of life
[1:09:54] to remain there
[1:09:56] it doesn't mean that you just have to be
[1:09:59] there you must be there and you must
[1:10:01] also have something in you
[1:10:07] you must have a book within a book
[1:10:12] amen
[1:10:14] hallelujah
[1:10:15] verse 13
[1:10:17] therefore speak eye to them in water
[1:10:20] because there is no decoder in them
[1:10:23] amen
[1:10:24] because they
[1:10:26] sing
[1:10:30] they don't see
[1:10:31] so what does he mean by seeing
[1:10:34] i see this board
[1:10:36] but do you really see
[1:10:39] that c means something else
[1:10:42] it means to
[1:10:43] understand
[1:10:45] make sense
[1:10:47] they're seeing
[1:10:49] amen
[1:10:50] because they're seeing see not
[1:10:54] and hearing two words
[1:10:57] they hear not
[1:10:59] neither do they water
[1:11:02] there's no understanding
[1:11:04] they can hear the message
[1:11:06] they can see what you're talking about
[1:11:08] but they still can grasp it
[1:11:12] amen can get them
[1:11:14] amen
[1:11:16] verse 14 and in them not everybody
[1:11:20] is fulfilled the prophecy of isaiah
[1:11:23] which says
[1:11:24] by hearing you shall heal
[1:11:27] naturally
[1:11:29] and shall not understand why can isaiah
[1:11:33] pray something like that for someone
[1:11:36] saying give them an opportunity to hear
[1:11:39] but not to decode them
[1:11:43] hallelujah
[1:11:45] and shall not understand and seeing
[1:11:48] you shall see
[1:11:49] and shall not water
[1:11:51] there is a perception
[1:11:54] amen
[1:11:56] watch verse 15
[1:11:57] for these people's heart
[1:12:01] so those things
[1:12:02] the seeing
[1:12:04] and the hearing is not really connected
[1:12:07] to the five senses
[1:12:08] [Music]
[1:12:09] that healing have nothing to do with
[1:12:12] this
[1:12:13] does seeing have nothing to do with this
[1:12:16] both the hearing and the seeing have
[1:12:20] something to do with their heart
[1:12:23] their heart must see
[1:12:25] and their heart must understand
[1:12:30] make sense
[1:12:31] how do you understand with your heart
[1:12:34] how do you see with your heart
[1:12:38] when somebody talk to you say oh i see
[1:12:41] that's not here
[1:12:44] that is here
[1:12:46] because you were looking at the person
[1:12:47] you didn't see before
[1:12:49] but after a while you say oh i see what
[1:12:51] he was talking about
[1:12:53] actually what happened is your heart
[1:12:56] actually decoded
[1:12:59] makes sense
[1:13:01] for these people's heart is what's gross
[1:13:04] though
[1:13:05] and their ears are dull of hearing and
[1:13:08] their eyes have their clothes they
[1:13:10] didn't do this
[1:13:15] if not they're gonna stumble
[1:13:17] even to the daylight
[1:13:19] amen
[1:13:20] at any less at any time they should do
[1:13:24] what
[1:13:25] they should see with their eyes
[1:13:28] and hear with their ears
[1:13:30] and shoot water
[1:13:32] understand with the water
[1:13:35] you see that
[1:13:36] am i reading a different bible
[1:13:38] understand with their heart and should
[1:13:41] be what
[1:13:43] so to be converted
[1:13:49] you must hear with your heart
[1:13:52] and you must see with your heart
[1:13:56] if it doesn't jump in the heart and it
[1:13:59] stays in your brain
[1:14:01] you can never be born again
[1:14:07] make sense now
[1:14:08] he says that it should understand with
[1:14:11] their heart and should be converted and
[1:14:14] i shall do what
[1:14:16] in other words there is a process in the
[1:14:18] heart
[1:14:19] once their heart is decoding the
[1:14:23] language of god
[1:14:24] god is under obligation
[1:14:29] to hear that person
[1:14:33] make sense
[1:14:34] so god have to block that process
[1:14:40] why
[1:14:43] verse 16
[1:14:44] but blessed are your eyes
[1:14:49] you see the difference
[1:14:51] for the sea
[1:14:52] and your ears
[1:14:54] for they do what
[1:14:56] so somebody is blessed and somebody is
[1:15:00] cursed
[1:15:01] [Music]
[1:15:05] to help you up
[1:15:06] i'm going to pull the same thing from
[1:15:08] mark
[1:15:09] mark say he said unto them unto you it
[1:15:13] is given to know the water
[1:15:15] of the water
[1:15:17] of the kingdom of god but unto them that
[1:15:21] are water
[1:15:22] that are not within they are not part of
[1:15:25] me
[1:15:26] amen they are outsider
[1:15:29] all these things are done in what
[1:15:32] in parable that seeing the mercy and not
[1:15:37] perceive and hearing they may hear
[1:15:39] another
[1:15:40] less at any time there should be
[1:15:44] and the sin should be water
[1:15:46] so god broke it so that he cannot
[1:15:49] forgive them
[1:15:56] make sense
[1:15:57] in matthew it says healing them
[1:16:00] in mark it is really based on
[1:16:03] forgiveness
[1:16:04] so not everybody can be forgiven
[1:16:12] let's go to revelation chapter nine
[1:16:15] yep
[1:16:17] now you grown up you're gonna eat meat
[1:16:19] [Laughter]
[1:16:24] i can't be giving 40 years old bored of
[1:16:26] me
[1:16:32] amen 40 years old coming back from work
[1:16:36] and say hey honey where is my bottle of
[1:16:38] milk
[1:16:39] something is wrong
[1:16:42] something is wrong
[1:16:45] you need a hamburger
[1:16:50] amen you need grown-up food
[1:16:55] [Music]
[1:16:57] amen
[1:16:59] because the more they give you milk milk
[1:17:01] milk
[1:17:02] actually you are getting lazy
[1:17:06] flair
[1:17:07] [Music]
[1:17:09] you don't have enough strength to fight
[1:17:12] the devil
[1:17:14] because it's milk
[1:17:16] but you give it to the children they
[1:17:18] start jumping
[1:17:19] because the energy came up
[1:17:22] not old people you need fufu
[1:17:26] let's go to revelation 9.
[1:17:28] that was his sense of humor
[1:17:36] somebody said what is that
[1:17:40] it looked like mashed potato let's go
[1:17:42] revelation 9
[1:17:47] amen
[1:17:51] that's why paul say
[1:17:53] let's lay aside
[1:17:56] the principle let's move on to what
[1:18:00] not laying again the foundation even
[1:18:03] though we will do that
[1:18:06] turning around turning around moses say
[1:18:09] enough you have turned around this
[1:18:11] mountain a long time let's go what not
[1:18:14] for it
[1:18:15] too much staying here
[1:18:18] lord lord lord forgiveness lord lord
[1:18:20] lord forgive the jump today i'm sorry
[1:18:22] i'm still struggling dumb today hey hey
[1:18:24] come on grown up put your big people
[1:18:28] paints
[1:18:33] tell the devil i am grown up
[1:18:38] tell the devil i am grown up
[1:18:41] don't come to me with this pornography
[1:18:44] this is staying at home not going to
[1:18:46] church i don't have to deal with these
[1:18:48] small devils
[1:18:53] how can you be 20 years struggling about
[1:18:55] the same thing
[1:18:59] and you happy i'm struggling it's
[1:19:01] christian life no you gotta pass that
[1:19:04] test
[1:19:10] revelation 9
[1:19:12] verse 20 you there
[1:19:14] and the rest of the men which were not
[1:19:17] killed by the
[1:19:18] by these plagues the plagues are already
[1:19:20] explaining to you we went with the seven
[1:19:22] angels and the plague the pledge is like
[1:19:24] a whooping
[1:19:26] that god brings and whoop somebody if
[1:19:28] you're his child it's to bring you back
[1:19:30] to normal if you're not his child is to
[1:19:33] take you somewhere anybody clear but
[1:19:36] these people received the plague
[1:19:38] but the plague did not kill them
[1:19:40] so normally when they whoop him
[1:19:42] automatically as a child you got to
[1:19:44] correct yourself
[1:19:46] but let's see if these are going to be
[1:19:47] corrected
[1:19:48] and the rest of the men which were not
[1:19:50] killed by this plague
[1:19:52] yet
[1:19:53] repented not
[1:20:00] brother continue your life
[1:20:03] if you're waiting for everybody that bid
[1:20:05] you wrong
[1:20:07] to come and apologize to you some will
[1:20:09] not come
[1:20:13] you're gonna wait for years
[1:20:19] the lord struck them you say i had to
[1:20:22] gather now i'm expecting them tomorrow
[1:20:24] they're gonna say i'm sorry for the way
[1:20:25] we treated you
[1:20:29] so keep going on your highway
[1:20:32] don't be distracted with everybody
[1:20:35] because you don't know which seat they
[1:20:37] have
[1:20:43] yet repented not of the works of their
[1:20:46] hand
[1:20:48] that they should not worship devils
[1:20:50] and idols of gold and silver and brass
[1:20:54] and stone and of wood neither can see
[1:20:58] nor
[1:20:59] hear nor walk
[1:21:01] neither repent a day of their murders
[1:21:06] nor of their sorceries
[1:21:08] nor of their fornication
[1:21:11] nor of the water
[1:21:13] so no matter how much god can whoop them
[1:21:16] they're not going to change
[1:21:19] amen
[1:21:20] there was two fifa the cross
[1:21:23] one being guilty dying at the cross but
[1:21:27] regardless of the circumstances he was
[1:21:30] there he's still mocking jesus christ
[1:21:33] how can you be guilty and keep doing
[1:21:35] wrong
[1:21:37] even before you die he's still doing
[1:21:39] wrong
[1:21:40] and the other one stop and push a break
[1:21:43] and say wait a minute we are guilty not
[1:21:45] this man
[1:21:46] then jesus turned around and said okay i
[1:21:48] remember before you were the one that
[1:21:50] was holding this plan here so
[1:21:53] go ahead and check in and let's go
[1:21:57] amen
[1:21:58] go to revelation 15 and then we're going
[1:22:00] to pray
[1:22:03] [Music]
[1:22:05] you see why david said let's the table
[1:22:09] you see why

[1:22:26] are you there but don't be wasting your
[1:22:28] time to be waiting for them
[1:22:30] [Music]
[1:22:33] and you holding their grudges
[1:22:36] let it go you don't know who they are
[1:22:40] amen
[1:22:42] 15 1. and i saw another angel another
[1:22:45] son in heaven i'm sorry great and
[1:22:48] marvelous seven angels having the seven
[1:22:51] last plagues
[1:22:52] for in them is fill up the water
[1:22:56] job to verse seven
[1:22:58] and one of the four beasts you know him
[1:23:00] now
[1:23:01] you remember when they say one of the
[1:23:03] four beasts
[1:23:04] it means who
[1:23:06] you need to go review it means a lion
[1:23:10] one of the four beasts
[1:23:11] gave to the seven angels
[1:23:14] seven golden vowels full of what
[1:23:18] the wrath of god who live forever and
[1:23:22] and ever everybody clear
[1:23:25] job to let me read this and then we're
[1:23:27] going to pray go to verse
[1:23:28] chapter 16 job to verse 10.
[1:23:36] it's important so when we get to the
[1:23:38] angelic realm you're going to understand
[1:23:41] and the fifth angel poured out his vow
[1:23:44] upon the seat of the beast and his
[1:23:46] kingdom was full of darkness
[1:23:49] and then now there are tongues for pain
[1:23:51] indeed water
[1:23:53] can you imagine
[1:23:55] they're getting whooped but they're
[1:23:56] still cursing
[1:24:01] and blaspheme who the god of heaven
[1:24:04] because of their parents and their soul
[1:24:07] and repented not of their
[1:24:11] normally when something is tracking a
[1:24:13] child it's like father i'm sorry i won't
[1:24:16] do it again i'm sorry i'm sorry but
[1:24:19] these you whoop and they cast
[1:24:21] you whoop the casting you hope the
[1:24:23] blasphemer
[1:24:24] that's why david said you know what
[1:24:27] turn them down
[1:24:28] go to the book of life
[1:24:30] remove them
[1:24:32] jesus said you can't give them the
[1:24:33] mysteries
[1:24:34] because they can't get it
[1:24:36] amen there is nothing in them that can
[1:24:39] get it the bible say godly sorrow bring
[1:24:42] what
[1:24:42] it will bring you unto repentance
[1:24:45] regardless of what god will do they will
[1:24:47] not repent
[1:24:49] let's pray
[1:24:51] heavenly father lord we thank you again
[1:24:53] for your grace your love your mercy and
[1:24:55] for everything you have been doing for
[1:24:57] us father thank you for helping us even
[1:25:00] to be able to read your scripture but
[1:25:02] this is as far as a man can go lord may
[1:25:05] you come and move me completely assad
[1:25:08] away from this pulpit but may you come
[1:25:10] and speak to your children and may you
[1:25:12] be the one speaking and the one hearing
[1:25:14] lord because no one can hear what the
[1:25:17] spirit says says the holy spirit himself
[1:25:20] decoding your own language to your
[1:25:22] children lord made the devil kovid 19
[1:25:26] whatever it is delta or whichever
[1:25:28] sickness is on the ground father may it
[1:25:31] be completely out of this place
[1:25:34] and not of your children if somebody for
[1:25:37] by uh adventure was exposed to it and
[1:25:41] maybe unconscious not knowing or went to
[1:25:43] walmart and father shook hand with
[1:25:45] somebody not knowing it father may you
[1:25:48] touch them and heal them we thank you
[1:25:50] for protecting our brother hamilton lord
[1:25:52] father you did it for him you can do it
[1:25:54] for every single person that is here
[1:25:57] this morning because you're the one that
[1:25:59] can vaccinate it better than any human
[1:26:02] being that's why we ask it in the name
[1:26:05] of jesus christ and rebuke every demonic
[1:26:07] spirit away from this place lord in the
[1:26:11] name of jesus christ
[1:26:13] amen
[1:26:14] god bless you we are continuing we are
[1:26:17] on origin part five amen
[1:26:20] we were talking about the subject of the
[1:26:23] second death everybody clear we talked
[1:26:25] about the first death the mystery of the
[1:26:27] resurrection uh the the mystery of death
[1:26:30] and the resurrection and the souls of
[1:26:32] the just and everything you already
[1:26:34] understand this thing we're on the
[1:26:36] second death but to understand the
[1:26:38] second death we say we have to go
[1:26:40] through the origin because the second
[1:26:42] death according to bro to the scripture
[1:26:45] the bible says that death and hell which
[1:26:47] is something bad were cast into the lake
[1:26:50] of fire this is the second death so the
[1:26:52] second death is the lake of fire and the
[1:26:55] bible say in revelation 21 verse 8 that
[1:26:58] but two by the fearful and the
[1:27:00] unbelieving and the abominable and the
[1:27:02] murderers and the whole mongers the
[1:27:05] sorcerer and idolater and all liars
[1:27:08] shall have their part or their time in
[1:27:11] the lake which burneth with fire and
[1:27:14] brimstone which is the second death so
[1:27:17] here you can see that everything that is
[1:27:20] wrong
[1:27:21] will be consumed in the lake of fire
[1:27:24] amen but not only those that are
[1:27:27] sorcerer and murderers that we know that
[1:27:29] are in the jail right now but even some
[1:27:33] of the people that are sitting within
[1:27:35] the churches
[1:27:37] will find themselves into the lake of
[1:27:40] fire that's when we open up with the uh
[1:27:43] mixed multitude ever clear so when we
[1:27:46] start this origin the first one we spoke
[1:27:49] about the vessels of mercy
[1:27:52] the second one we spoke about the just
[1:27:55] that that were like lamb because they
[1:27:57] were good unto the brethren amen that
[1:28:00] was the example we took off an egyptian
[1:28:03] among the america that was rescued by
[1:28:05] david and back here then we went from
[1:28:08] there into the mix multitude and in the
[1:28:11] mix multitude we found out that it is no
[1:28:13] more outside people but it's people that
[1:28:16] are within the camp and we took the
[1:28:19] example of david and the example of
[1:28:23] nabal both david and nebo were from the
[1:28:26] tribe of judah amen but never was full
[1:28:30] about here and connected to abigail and
[1:28:33] abigail have to be rescued from neban
[1:28:36] from foley a wise woman who was
[1:28:39] connected to foley everybody clear but
[1:28:42] she have to be rescued because the
[1:28:44] righteous should no longer continue with
[1:28:46] the unjust unless they're gonna touch
[1:28:49] the things that are not support they are
[1:28:51] not supposed to touch amen we continue
[1:28:54] on the mixed multitude and now we are
[1:28:56] getting into the vessels of wrath
[1:29:00] there is a vessel of mercy according to
[1:29:02] romans chapter 9 if you remember and we
[1:29:04] also have the vessels of wrath everybody
[1:29:07] clear
[1:29:08] now to understand the vessels of wrath
[1:29:12] we need to go back up again into the
[1:29:14] beginning
[1:29:15] let's go to the book of jude again
[1:29:17] that's where we are
[1:29:20] judy have only one chapter
[1:29:22] the book of jude and lord is willing
[1:29:25] this will prepare it for wednesday when
[1:29:27] we begin to get into the angelic claims
[1:29:30] everybody clear
[1:29:31] we were in jude chapter five
[1:29:35] the bible said i will therefore put you
[1:29:37] in remembrance because we gotta fight
[1:29:39] for that faith
[1:29:40] though you once knew this how did the
[1:29:43] lord have saved the people remember he's
[1:29:45] a judge
[1:29:46] and he's also a savior he's the lion and
[1:29:50] he's also a lamb
[1:29:52] as a lamb he comes to save you as a
[1:29:54] judge he's coming to destroy but there
[1:29:57] are people that cannot be destroyed amen
[1:30:00] because they are children of god he said
[1:30:02] having safe that's the lamb the people
[1:30:05] out of the land of egypt after all
[1:30:08] destroyed now a lion them that believe
[1:30:12] not
[1:30:13] we're going to see down the road why
[1:30:15] they didn't believe but you already know
[1:30:17] verse 6 and the angels which kept not
[1:30:21] their first estate
[1:30:23] they had a position
[1:30:25] they have any state
[1:30:27] they have a place
[1:30:29] they have a slot
[1:30:33] but for some reason they could not keep
[1:30:36] the slot
[1:30:38] something happened that caused them to
[1:30:41] lose that slot
[1:30:43] ever clear we will get into this further
[1:30:46] down the road
[1:30:47] and the angel which kept not their first
[1:30:50] state
[1:30:51] but left their own
[1:30:53] habitation remember david say let their
[1:30:55] habitation be desolate
[1:30:58] remember they left their own habitation
[1:31:02] he reserved in everlasting chance in
[1:31:06] prison under darkness to the judgment of
[1:31:10] the great day so now we're blending
[1:31:13] between the mixed multitude and going
[1:31:15] into the angelic range everybody clear
[1:31:19] now when we spoke to you we explained to
[1:31:22] you that eternity is like a ring
[1:31:25] everybody clear
[1:31:26] i hope this battery is working
[1:31:28] eternity is like a ring everybody clear
[1:31:32] and brother branham said eternity is
[1:31:34] like a circle a circle there is no
[1:31:36] beginning there is no end
[1:31:39] and the only creature
[1:31:41] that could fit eternity was god
[1:31:44] because god is infinite and god is
[1:31:47] eternal everybody clear
[1:31:49] i hope there is is there anything
[1:31:51] blocking something there
[1:31:53] okay it's working it's only god god is
[1:31:56] eternal and brother branham said god was
[1:31:59] a fountain of the seven colors i already
[1:32:02] explained you this
[1:32:03] now this being called god
[1:32:06] defeat eternity amen
[1:32:09] that fit all eternity because only god
[1:32:11] is eternal
[1:32:13] and eternity to be fair need a being
[1:32:16] that is also eternal so god and eternity
[1:32:20] are like a hand and a glove
[1:32:23] they fit together amen so when god
[1:32:27] filled all space
[1:32:29] all that eternity
[1:32:31] god didn't have any room
[1:32:34] to do what he wanted to do
[1:32:36] anybody following me so god have to
[1:32:39] create room from eternity
[1:32:42] so that he can have space
[1:32:45] to express the things that was within
[1:32:47] himself
[1:32:49] everybody following me
[1:32:50] so god by feeling all eternity
[1:32:54] god knew every corner of eternity
[1:32:58] there is no corner of eternity that god
[1:33:02] doesn't know
[1:33:04] if you ask god how is corner hey god
[1:33:07] knows him how he's gonna be god knows it
[1:33:10] how he's gonna see god knows it how he's
[1:33:13] gonna eat every single part of eternity
[1:33:17] god knows it
[1:33:19] because god filled all eternity
[1:33:23] everybody clear so through the process
[1:33:25] of kenosis
[1:33:27] and a murphy we found that god
[1:33:31] who was eternal who was invisible who
[1:33:34] was feeling all this eternity begin to
[1:33:37] shrink himself down
[1:33:39] and when god strike himself down god
[1:33:43] turned into something that was called
[1:33:45] the pillar of fire everybody clear
[1:33:48] the pillar of fire was not different
[1:33:51] than the being that was filling all
[1:33:54] eternity everybody clear the difference
[1:33:58] between the pillar of fire and the god
[1:34:01] that fell that field all eternity
[1:34:04] is only that the pillar of fire have
[1:34:08] compact god
[1:34:10] have blood of god into a one lord of
[1:34:14] being into a light everybody clear
[1:34:16] understand me and the pillar of fire
[1:34:20] gave god the ability to have room
[1:34:23] around him
[1:34:25] [Music]
[1:34:27] are you following me
[1:34:30] amen so the positive
[1:34:34] color or the positive charge were
[1:34:37] completely compact
[1:34:39] into the pillar of fire and by god
[1:34:41] shrinking himself
[1:34:43] into a light he creates space all around
[1:34:47] him
[1:34:48] ever here in other words eternity have
[1:34:52] gaps
[1:34:54] ever here at the beginning god could not
[1:34:57] move to the right or to the left because
[1:35:00] god feels all eternity but through the
[1:35:02] pillar of fire now god can begin to move
[1:35:06] left and right
[1:35:08] up and down and go to the north to the
[1:35:10] south into eternity that's why brother
[1:35:13] bonham said he begin to play like a
[1:35:16] little boy on eternity god begin to run
[1:35:19] and go here and god begin to run god
[1:35:22] begin to have more surprises
[1:35:25] everybody here when a baby is in the
[1:35:28] womb of mama the baby is tight
[1:35:32] amen when he moves like this he's
[1:35:34] kicking mama everybody here so the baby
[1:35:37] have to be born
[1:35:38] once the baby's born into the world then
[1:35:41] the baby is free the baby can move his
[1:35:44] feet up they can move their hands up and
[1:35:47] down they can run and do everything they
[1:35:49] want to do they no longer are a burden
[1:35:52] to mama
[1:35:54] everybody clear so eternity have to
[1:35:56] release god
[1:35:59] and when eternity release god
[1:36:02] god shrank himself into the light
[1:36:05] that light is the light that paul met on
[1:36:08] the road to damascus
[1:36:10] that's why paul said who are you lord
[1:36:13] and that light say i am jesus whom the
[1:36:17] persecuted the god of the old testament
[1:36:20] was jesus christ in the new testament
[1:36:25] because god is light in the beginning
[1:36:28] was the word and the word was with god
[1:36:31] and that word was god everybody clear so
[1:36:34] far so now the pillar of fire begin to
[1:36:37] have freedom
[1:36:40] now kinesis means everything that was in
[1:36:44] a was transferred completely to be
[1:36:50] everybody clear
[1:36:51] now all the knowledge of eternity
[1:36:55] was not lost
[1:36:58] everybody
[1:36:59] everything that was in that spirit was
[1:37:02] still in the pillar of fire but it was
[1:37:05] blocked completely under because the
[1:37:07] pillar of fire wanted to express himself
[1:37:10] god want to pull things out of himself
[1:37:13] about clear
[1:37:15] now
[1:37:15] right here god was no longer a creature
[1:37:20] that fills eternity
[1:37:24] everybody clear
[1:37:25] god became a creature that you can point
[1:37:29] to
[1:37:30] anybody here you can look and you say i
[1:37:33] see god there
[1:37:35] ever clear
[1:37:36] if he moves you say i see god over there
[1:37:41] ever here
[1:37:42] if you if god moves you can say i see
[1:37:45] god over there
[1:37:46] anybody here if you turn around you say
[1:37:49] sister you are struggling with so and so
[1:37:52] you have a female trouble why because i
[1:37:55] see the light on top of you and suddenly
[1:37:57] brother pranam will turn around and he
[1:38:00] say i see that same light moving over
[1:38:02] there and now the same light is sitting
[1:38:05] upon sister pam over there this is what
[1:38:07] is going on sister pam this is what is
[1:38:10] going on in your life go home and you
[1:38:12] are here and that same light begin to
[1:38:14] move in other words you can now pinpoint
[1:38:17] god
[1:38:18] [Music]
[1:38:22] everybody here
[1:38:23] so the god
[1:38:25] and eternity when they show you god you
[1:38:29] say this is god
[1:38:32] where is god this is god
[1:38:34] where is god this is god
[1:38:36] but in the pillar of fire you can't say
[1:38:38] this is god you say this is god right
[1:38:41] here
[1:38:42] amen god became a being
[1:38:46] everybody clear but the knowledge of god
[1:38:49] in the pillar of fire remained the same
[1:38:53] knowledge
[1:38:55] that he has when he filled all eternity
[1:39:00] everybody clear
[1:39:02] that ability
[1:39:04] made god omnipresent
[1:39:08] [Music]
[1:39:11] you understand
[1:39:13] god the omnipresent
[1:39:16] does not mean that god healed everywhere
[1:39:24] are we awake god is a being
[1:39:28] you can point him like you said this is
[1:39:31] brother kalima if he moved there you say
[1:39:34] brother kalima move over there if he
[1:39:36] goes there you say brother kalima move
[1:39:37] over there amen god now can be
[1:39:41] pinpointed
[1:39:42] yet god is omnipresent
[1:39:47] the omnipresence of god
[1:39:50] does not mean that he feel
[1:39:52] everything the only presence of god god
[1:39:57] is omnipresent by knowledge
[1:40:04] what are you saying
[1:40:06] brother kalima brother robert is there
[1:40:10] with sister laurel
[1:40:11] but robert is sitting in his bedroom
[1:40:14] with sister l'oreal they're talking and
[1:40:16] brother robert begin to tell cecil
[1:40:18] tomorrow i'm gonna go to walmart and i'm
[1:40:21] going to pick up something then i'll go
[1:40:22] to home depot then i will come back to
[1:40:25] church then i have certain things to do
[1:40:27] and there is nobody there
[1:40:29] but brother robert and sister royale
[1:40:32] rebel clear
[1:40:35] and suddenly i came home
[1:40:38] and i went to visit brother robert and i
[1:40:40] knock at the door
[1:40:42] and sister hadassah comes and opened it
[1:40:44] oh brother stephen pastor come sit down
[1:40:46] and i sat down
[1:40:48] when brother robert comes out and said
[1:40:50] god bless you brother robert you were
[1:40:52] sitting with sister laurel
[1:40:54] in your bedroom
[1:40:56] and you were talking to sister l'oreal
[1:40:58] and you taught sister laurel that you're
[1:41:00] going to walmart
[1:41:02] and after one month you're gonna go to
[1:41:04] home depot and after home depot you're
[1:41:06] gonna go to church to work
[1:41:08] what will be the reaction of brother
[1:41:10] robert
[1:41:17] did you hear me
[1:41:18] the way i spoke
[1:41:21] it seems like i was there
[1:41:24] with sister l'oreal and brother robert
[1:41:26] but i was not there
[1:41:32] everybody here i was there by knowledge
[1:41:37] america
[1:41:39] everywhere here but i was not there by
[1:41:42] my presence
[1:41:44] here that's why when israel was in war
[1:41:48] with the syrian
[1:41:49] everything that the king was doing was
[1:41:52] disclosed to israel and the king called
[1:41:56] he said wait a minute do we have spies
[1:41:58] here or do we have iphone or ring bell
[1:42:02] or camera in this room that are
[1:42:05] recording everything or do we have an
[1:42:07] fbi here
[1:42:10] someone say it's not fbi
[1:42:12] fbi is a copy
[1:42:15] amen there is someone in israel who is a
[1:42:19] prophet
[1:42:20] and that man
[1:42:22] even though he's in israel he can tell
[1:42:24] you everything that you are speaking in
[1:42:27] your bedroom
[1:42:29] that man doesn't have to be there
[1:42:32] he only have to connect with the one
[1:42:36] that knows everything
[1:42:41] ever clear that's why brother branham
[1:42:44] was saying i cannot do anything until he
[1:42:48] comes here
[1:42:49] and when the penalty of fire entered
[1:42:51] brother branham said i take every spirit
[1:42:54] here under my control
[1:42:57] everybody here then brother branham can
[1:42:59] turn around and say sister you coming
[1:43:02] from so and so you did so and so and
[1:43:05] brother branham can go back hold in your
[1:43:08] life
[1:43:09] he can also move forward in your life
[1:43:12] and even tell you things that have not
[1:43:14] happened yet
[1:43:19] that is god
[1:43:20] his only presence
[1:43:23] is not by being but omnipresence by
[1:43:27] knowledge
[1:43:31] hallelujah
[1:43:33] blessed be the name of the lord god is
[1:43:36] omnipotent omnipresent
[1:43:39] by being omniscient
[1:43:42] meaning knowing everything
[1:43:46] makes him water
[1:43:48] he knows all things
[1:43:51] but god
[1:43:52] could not be just like the aries
[1:43:55] because god has a dwelling place
[1:43:58] god is not a myth
[1:44:00] god is a
[1:44:02] god jesus he god pronoun he is a being
[1:44:08] therefore he is omniscient omnipresent
[1:44:11] omnipotent and infinite now to be
[1:44:15] infinite it comes through the word
[1:44:17] infinite which there is no limit
[1:44:20] he is eternal eternal like a water
[1:44:24] he goes around and around and you are
[1:44:27] trying to find where he began or where
[1:44:29] he ends there is no beginning or no
[1:44:32] ending everybody creates so far blessed
[1:44:35] be the name of the lord and if he is not
[1:44:38] infinite he is not god
[1:44:40] god has to be infinite we are finite he
[1:44:43] is infinite and he was omnipresent
[1:44:46] omniscient and omnipotent
[1:44:48] if he is not then he can be god
[1:44:51] knows all things
[1:44:53] all places because of his omnipresence
[1:44:57] omniscient makes him omnipresent
[1:45:00] he he's a being he's not like the wind
[1:45:04] he's a being he does in a house
[1:45:07] but being omniscient
[1:45:09] come on
[1:45:10] knowing all things come on makes him
[1:45:14] water
[1:45:15] because he knows everything that is
[1:45:18] going on
[1:45:19] there can be a flea but it's eyes but
[1:45:23] what god knoweth
[1:45:25] and he know it before there was a world
[1:45:29] how many times about how many times he
[1:45:32] badgetized and how much tello he had in
[1:45:35] him there before there ever was a world
[1:45:38] that is infinite we can't comprehend it
[1:45:41] in our minds but that is who
[1:45:44] god is what
[1:45:46] in other words god knows everything in
[1:45:50] your life
[1:45:51] everybody clear if you ask god right now
[1:45:55] where we sister so and so god will tell
[1:45:57] you she is in gastonia
[1:45:59] god doesn't have to be in gastonia but
[1:46:03] by knowledge it looks like everything
[1:46:06] you do in life he knows it
[1:46:08] ever clear he's not there present but
[1:46:12] he's there by knowledge
[1:46:17] and that knowledge give god the ability
[1:46:21] to be like his 24 hours around you
[1:46:26] if you ask him he knows everything you
[1:46:28] ask him he knows everything you ask him
[1:46:29] he knows until you feel like man
[1:46:32] there's nothing i can do that god
[1:46:33] doesn't know so god is omnipresent yeah
[1:46:36] that only present is by knowledge
[1:46:40] god have your whole life
[1:46:42] from your birth
[1:46:43] your conception all the way to the
[1:46:46] rapture if you ask him he's gonna tell
[1:46:49] you everything
[1:46:50] and by telling you everything since your
[1:46:53] childhood it seems like since your
[1:46:55] childhood he was with you
[1:46:57] [Music]
[1:47:00] ever here
[1:47:01] blessed be the name of the lord now this
[1:47:04] being here
[1:47:05] that was staying there by himself was
[1:47:09] not really himself
[1:47:12] [Music]
[1:47:14] amen
[1:47:15] brother branham
[1:47:18] brother branham say now physically we
[1:47:21] separate from our physical son talking
[1:47:23] about death because that is still sin
[1:47:26] but our spirit is of god that can never
[1:47:30] be separated from god
[1:47:32] because we are part of god
[1:47:35] we are brought back into the thoughts of
[1:47:37] god
[1:47:38] everything that god does is perfect
[1:47:42] and eternal
[1:47:44] and when god's very thought went out for
[1:47:47] water
[1:47:49] a kingdom of water
[1:47:51] so within the pillar of fire
[1:47:55] there was a kingdom
[1:47:58] inside the pillar of fire there was a
[1:48:01] kingdom of people
[1:48:05] anybody clear
[1:48:06] so when god
[1:48:08] was moving
[1:48:09] he was moving with a package
[1:48:13] do you follow me
[1:48:16] when abraham met melchizedek
[1:48:19] abraham paid that unto melchizedek
[1:48:24] everybody here
[1:48:26] but when paul came
[1:48:28] paul says that
[1:48:30] when abraham was being taught to
[1:48:32] melchizedek
[1:48:34] liver
[1:48:36] who was in abraham
[1:48:38] also paid part to melchizedek
[1:48:43] but
[1:48:44] abraham when he gave birth he gave birth
[1:48:47] to who
[1:48:49] isaac
[1:48:50] here
[1:48:52] did you see liver
[1:48:54] when isaac gave birth he gave birth to
[1:48:56] whom
[1:48:58] jacob did you see liver
[1:49:00] when jacob gave birth then liver came
[1:49:06] are you there
[1:49:07] so if liver was in the launch of abraham
[1:49:12] when abraham was moving liver was there
[1:49:16] when abraham slept lifa was there
[1:49:19] when abraham was i was was eating liver
[1:49:22] was there
[1:49:23] but to produce liver they have to first
[1:49:26] produce isaac and to produce isaac to
[1:49:30] produce liver isaac have to produce
[1:49:32] jacob and jacob's cam liver
[1:49:35] so where was isaac
[1:49:42] everybody here
[1:49:43] isaac was in abraham
[1:49:46] so where was jacob
[1:49:49] if levi was in abraham where was jacob
[1:49:53] so where was
[1:49:55] abraham the father of our faith
[1:50:00] everybody
[1:50:01] in other words when abraham was working
[1:50:04] all the children jacob was there
[1:50:08] you follow me isaac was there
[1:50:12] liver was there the entire family was
[1:50:15] walking with abraham
[1:50:21] the reason why liver
[1:50:24] intervene it was because god a morphine
[1:50:29] into melchizedek
[1:50:33] are you following me
[1:50:34] melchizedek is a priest
[1:50:38] ever here so when god presented to
[1:50:42] abraham according to hebrews 7 as
[1:50:44] melchizedek
[1:50:47] you follow me abraham was not a priest
[1:50:53] isaac was not a priest
[1:50:56] jacob was not a priest
[1:50:59] the priest that was in abraham move out
[1:51:03] and say hey i'm here i'm here i'm here
[1:51:06] i'm here ever here
[1:51:09] you understand then the priests have to
[1:51:12] talk to the priest
[1:51:14] do you follow me so i ibrahim
[1:51:17] had isaac he had jacob he had liver when
[1:51:22] he moved he's moving with his children
[1:51:30] god also was not alone he has also a
[1:51:34] package
[1:51:37] are you there when jesus christ came
[1:51:40] jesus has a package
[1:51:43] ever clear
[1:51:46] whenever when when adam was created
[1:51:50] adam had a package
[1:51:54] all they did was to do a surgery to pull
[1:51:57] the package out
[1:52:00] here
[1:52:01] [Applause]
[1:52:02] [Music]
[1:52:07] when abraham sleep live asleep
[1:52:10] because the one who gave the thought
[1:52:13] naturally was not leaver
[1:52:16] the one who gave that that naturally was
[1:52:19] abraham
[1:52:21] but liver he was compared unto him
[1:52:25] like he was the one that paid
[1:52:27] melchizedek
[1:52:33] being in christ
[1:52:36] we didn't have to die in calvary
[1:52:42] when jesus walked we were dead
[1:52:45] when jesus ate we were there when jesus
[1:52:48] cuts devil we were there so when jesus
[1:52:51] died we were there
[1:52:54] [Applause]
[1:52:59] when jesus went to hell we went to hell
[1:53:02] with him
[1:53:03] when he resurrected we resurrected with
[1:53:06] him
[1:53:08] are you there
[1:53:10] are you there
[1:53:12] so everything that jesus did
[1:53:16] god counted as it is you
[1:53:22] [Applause]
[1:53:27] if you look and you ask who's dying at
[1:53:30] the cross they're going to say it to
[1:53:32] jesus
[1:53:33] if you ask god who's dying at the cross
[1:53:37] god said it's mr keller
[1:53:39] it is brother greg
[1:53:41] it is enoch it is brother robert it is
[1:53:45] brother ramona
[1:53:47] [Applause]
[1:53:51] the one who gave that was abraham
[1:53:54] but he was not abraham he was liver
[1:53:57] liver pay the debt through abraham you
[1:54:01] paid the debt of god through jesus
[1:54:04] christ
[1:54:09] that's why you can no longer die again
[1:54:14] all you have to do is recognize that you
[1:54:17] came from god
[1:54:19] that will say
[1:54:20] god took your pleasure and what he did
[1:54:24] it is counted in your account
[1:54:33] that's why
[1:54:34] the bible says he that believes on the
[1:54:37] son has passed from death unto us
[1:54:40] never to be judged again because god
[1:54:43] judge you in jesus christ
[1:54:47] [Applause]
[1:54:51] by representation
[1:54:53] [Applause]
[1:54:56] condemnation by representation
[1:54:59] glory by representation
[1:55:02] blessing by
[1:55:04] representation
[1:55:08] [Applause]
[1:55:11] it doesn't matter how many generations
[1:55:15] it took for liver to come out still he
[1:55:18] belongs to him
[1:55:20] it doesn't matter how many years it took
[1:55:23] for you to be born you still still
[1:55:26] belong to you
[1:55:27] [Applause]
[1:55:30] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:55:33] lord
[1:55:34] hallelujah so out of god
[1:55:37] came a people
[1:55:39] so god when he was moving he has his
[1:55:41] children
[1:55:42] they were there
[1:55:44] and he say my god i need to get them out
[1:55:47] [Music]

[1:56:31] hallelujah
[1:56:32] when he moves he moves with them when he
[1:56:35] moves he moves him in other words it
[1:56:37] seems like god was fragmented
[1:56:40] [Music]
[1:56:49] hallelujah
[1:56:51] he said
[1:56:52] it's too much
[1:56:53] let me shrink myself and let me begin to
[1:56:56] pull them one by one
[1:56:59] hallelujah
[1:57:00] oh my god
[1:57:02] he said god
[1:57:04] very touch why not for water
[1:57:07] a kingdom of people who would do what
[1:57:12] them very thought is what
[1:57:19] in the beginning

[2:00:16] amen
[2:00:19] oh my god
[2:00:21] if they can no more perish
[2:00:24] every word of god is water
[2:00:28] before there was a world before there
[2:00:30] was a planet before there was a sun
[2:00:34] before there was a moon before there was
[2:00:36] light before there was anything when he
[2:00:40] was still who
[2:00:42] and god and his what
[2:00:45] the eternal thoughts of god
[2:00:48] chose you by
[2:00:51] by
[2:00:52] to know what you won't be on the earth
[2:00:59] hallelujah
[2:01:00] we get into the vessels of wrath
[2:01:03] in the beginning god was not even god
[2:01:08] he was the great eternal
[2:01:10] in there was attribute
[2:01:13] attribute was his thoughts
[2:01:15] and then he become a word like this and
[2:01:18] the word express a thought express is a
[2:01:21] word a word expresses a thought remember
[2:01:24] if you ever was in god's thinking
[2:01:27] you always be there
[2:01:30] if you got eternal life
[2:01:32] you are the expression
[2:01:35] or the attribute of his thought for this
[2:01:38] age
[2:01:39] if not there is only one eternal life
[2:01:42] and it always existed and you in his
[2:01:46] mind
[2:01:47] existed before there was a world
[2:01:50] that is the reason he said he chose you
[2:01:54] before the foundation of the
[2:01:57] it is not what we think
[2:02:00] what somebody else think it is what god
[2:02:03] eternal
[2:02:06] it is his thinking
[2:02:08] when we say thoughts
[2:02:11] as human being we usually have a
[2:02:14] tendency to think about
[2:02:16] ideas anybody clear
[2:02:20] remember if you never was in god's
[2:02:22] thought you shall never be with god
[2:02:26] how many knows
[2:02:28] that he was a redeemer
[2:02:30] anything with him has to come back to
[2:02:33] where he
[2:02:36] so if he come to redeem us
[2:02:39] how could we we or how could we
[2:02:42] was one time didn't have to be with him
[2:02:46] and we were all born in sin
[2:02:49] shaping iniquity come to the word
[2:02:51] speaking lies it shows that the real
[2:02:54] christian is a water
[2:02:56] of water
[2:02:58] to redeem means to take something that
[2:03:01] has fallen
[2:03:03] from its position
[2:03:05] back to each position
[2:03:07] if god is redeeming you
[2:03:10] it is telling you you are worse in a
[2:03:13] certain position
[2:03:17] you just lost that position
[2:03:19] and god is coming to bring you back to
[2:03:22] that position
[2:03:24] but what was that position that you had
[2:03:30] hallelujah
[2:03:32] it shows that the real christian is a
[2:03:35] what
[2:03:36] attribute of god's thinking before there
[2:03:39] was a
[2:03:40] or a star or air or anything else it is
[2:03:44] eternal and he come to redeem us back
[2:03:50] hallelujah
[2:03:51] blessed be the name of the lord now when
[2:03:54] we say thoughts
[2:03:56] our human mind have a tendency to think
[2:03:59] like an idea
[2:04:01] like the wind
[2:04:03] huh little idea
[2:04:05] in your mind that is
[2:04:07] flying you say uh that's my thought
[2:04:09] that's my thought we have a tendency to
[2:04:11] think that thoughts are not real they're
[2:04:14] just like ideas
[2:04:15] real we say oh yeah this is real
[2:04:18] this is real this is we thought they
[2:04:20] thought it's just imaginary that's not
[2:04:23] how god's thoughts are
[2:04:29] that is human thoughts
[2:04:32] but when they say that we were taught it
[2:04:34] doesn't mean we were imaginary
[2:04:36] [Music]
[2:04:38] when they say liver gave that he was not
[2:04:41] an imaginary liver because later on
[2:04:44] liver was born
[2:04:46] and when he was born automatically the
[2:04:48] priesthood was given unto him
[2:04:50] because he that would they met him as
[2:04:52] melchizedek because god has a tendency
[2:04:55] to flip
[2:04:57] to to a morphe to change form when he
[2:04:59] change form he can be a priest
[2:05:02] and tomorrow he can be a king
[2:05:04] when he can be a king you see him as
[2:05:06] david
[2:05:08] when he's a king david come out
[2:05:18] i will now go there
[2:05:20] hallelujah when he stands in eternity
[2:05:23] if he flip
[2:05:25] somebody is popping up
[2:05:28] [Music]
[2:05:31] be careful here and see
[2:05:33] this is not
[2:05:35] the person that comes predestinated
[2:05:37] eternally from god
[2:05:39] it is the water
[2:05:41] or the water
[2:05:44] [Music]
[2:05:48] liver was a seed
[2:05:51] in abraham so abraham was carrying seed
[2:05:55] a bag of seed
[2:05:59] but those seed
[2:06:01] could do certain things
[2:06:03] so they will not see the imaginary
[2:06:07] hallelujah
[2:06:08] that is
[2:06:10] way back there too far for the human
[2:06:13] mind to grasp
[2:06:14] the eternal god
[2:06:16] with eternal water
[2:06:19] thoughts and what
[2:06:25] jacob has i loved
[2:06:27] but he so have a water
[2:06:30] oh
[2:06:32] and neither was born
[2:06:35] and neither had done good or evil
[2:06:37] he was a water
[2:06:40] and then that thought became expressed
[2:06:43] and god brought back jacob because jacob
[2:06:47] belong was what
[2:06:49] jacob alone the seed that is why he had
[2:06:53] respect to the birthright
[2:06:55] and covenant of god
[2:06:57] if you are a true seed
[2:07:00] you will hear that word
[2:07:02] the spirit will baptize you into the
[2:07:05] body of christ
[2:07:07] filling you and empowering you and you
[2:07:09] will receive the word for your day and
[2:07:12] age
[2:07:14] see how clear the true evidence becomes
[2:07:19] when the word is revealed to you
[2:07:25] buckle up pretty good
[2:07:27] you ready
[2:07:29] what are you talking about by seed
[2:07:31] brother stephen
[2:07:34] hallelujah
[2:07:35] brother branham say
[2:07:37] and the real seed of god is a weapon
[2:07:42] for the water
[2:07:48] so when you existed of god
[2:07:51] god carry you as a seed
[2:07:54] that seed is not just a seed
[2:07:58] it is a seed with a word in it
[2:08:02] you follow me you follow me and that
[2:08:04] seed
[2:08:05] has a power to suck god
[2:08:11] make sense

[2:08:15] if i take that seed

[2:09:30] nothing to do to be saved
[2:09:38] my god
[2:09:40] i'm in the one eighth
[2:09:42] of where i'm going
[2:09:44] the real seed of god is an absorbent for
[2:09:48] the spirit
[2:09:49] all
[2:09:50] denominationalism is too cold all
[2:09:53] unbelief is out and when the holy spirit
[2:09:56] comes into that germ of life
[2:09:59] that is laying there he produces another

[2:11:17] if i ask you a question what do you see
[2:11:19] you say i see a seed

[2:11:32] of the tree
[2:11:34] is in the seed
[2:11:38] the color of that tree
[2:11:40] is in the seed
[2:11:41] the number of apple
[2:11:44] that will be produced is in the seed

[2:13:34] my god
[2:13:35] hallelujah
[2:13:37] hallelujah
[2:13:38] let me go again slowly
[2:13:41] see how this work
[2:13:43] god always had his thoughts for adam
[2:13:46] adam as his thoughts was yet unexpressed
[2:13:51] psalm 139 verse 15 and 16.
[2:13:55] we give you a little idea of this my
[2:13:59] substance
[2:14:00] was not hid from thee
[2:14:02] when i was made in
[2:14:05] in secret
[2:14:07] and curiously wrought in the lowest part
[2:14:09] of the earth
[2:14:11] damn eyes did see my
[2:14:14] yet being what
[2:14:18] so when you were in mama um
[2:14:20] when you were a conception a little
[2:14:22] embryo
[2:14:26] here
[2:14:27] and in thy
[2:14:28] book
[2:14:30] brother branham said thy book means the
[2:14:32] book of life
[2:14:34] in that book all my water
[2:14:37] where what
[2:14:38] so but the book of life brother branham
[2:14:41] said it contain only names
[2:14:46] because when they say the name that were
[2:14:48] now written in the book of life
[2:14:51] everybody clear so the way we thought
[2:14:53] was when we say book of life we think
[2:14:56] it's greg
[2:14:58] lamont that's nothing
[2:15:01] ever clear
[2:15:02] everybody
[2:15:03] because the book of life contained name
[2:15:05] but now david is saying that
[2:15:08] my members
[2:15:10] in other words my feet
[2:15:13] my hand
[2:15:14] were written in the book of life
[2:15:20] oh the book of life contain only names
[2:15:26] so your name is more than just the name
[2:15:30] your name is your being
[2:15:38] that book
[2:15:40] all my members were what
[2:15:44] he doesn't say
[2:15:46] his leg he's this when you look
[2:15:48] charles but in charles
[2:15:51] there is a big genetic code
[2:15:55] hallelujah
[2:15:57] which in continuous were fashioned
[2:16:00] when as yet they were
[2:16:06] hallelujah
[2:16:09] was not written about adam but he gave
[2:16:11] you the idea and knowledge that the
[2:16:14] thought was there in his mind and that
[2:16:17] thought was eternal and had to be
[2:16:20] expressed so when adam was formed of the
[2:16:23] dust of the earth and his spiritual
[2:16:26] being created by god then adam became
[2:16:28] god start express and those eternal
[2:16:31] thoughts were now what
[2:16:33] manifested
[2:16:35] so who you are
[2:16:36] your color your height
[2:16:40] your gender your hair everything was
[2:16:43] packaged under your name
[2:16:46] [Music]

[2:17:27] when he said lazarus the hair of lazarus
[2:17:30] adhered

[2:19:12] the book is
[2:19:13] while it's calling those what
[2:19:16] you finally understand now

[2:19:52] he began to preach
[2:19:53] and when people come to him he take them
[2:19:56] drawn them in the water they say what is

[2:20:18] even women even women yes even the women
[2:20:20] the children they put them and bring
[2:20:22] them back up
[2:20:25] the pharisees say wait a minute let's
[2:20:27] call the council
[2:20:28] there's a big church standing over there
[2:20:31] there's a man by the name of john
[2:20:34] who his father
[2:20:35] is a leaver he was a leaver here but he
[2:20:38] never stayed in the seminary
[2:20:40] he ran away from his parents to the bush
[2:20:43] now he's out he didn't even study the
[2:20:45] law of moses and here he's there he's
[2:20:48] joining people
[2:20:51] send
[2:20:52] people you you go ask him what is he
[2:20:54] doing
[2:20:58] are you there
[2:20:59] when they came
[2:21:01] they look
[2:21:04] they say who are you
[2:21:11] do you think they didn't know his name
[2:21:14] do you think they didn't know his name
[2:21:19] are you there
[2:21:22] john heard
[2:21:24] what they were asking him
[2:21:30] they were telling john
[2:21:32] show us your name in the book
[2:21:42] they were not asking john
[2:21:45] show us your name in the hospital
[2:21:50] they were not asking john show us your
[2:21:52] name in gastonia county
[2:21:55] [Music]
[2:21:57] they were asking john
[2:21:59] you bringing strange things
[2:22:03] but when we look
[2:22:05] we don't see you
[2:22:07] where are you in the book
[2:22:12] hallelujah
[2:22:14] that's why john never said that i am the
[2:22:18] son of zechariah they already knew him
[2:22:23] john said i am the voice
[2:22:28] of the one crying in the water
[2:22:35] john say i am isaiah 40.
[2:22:44] are you there
[2:22:45] are you there so when you look in the
[2:22:48] bible john the baptist john the baptist
[2:22:51] you will never find it in the old
[2:22:53] testament
[2:22:54] yet it is dead
[2:22:57] [Applause]
[2:22:59] the name of john
[2:23:01] was written in mystery
[2:23:05] [Music]
[2:23:07] are you there
[2:23:09] so when john said i am when god said i
[2:23:13] am the voice of the one crying in the
[2:23:16] wilderness john the baptist say here
[2:23:18] father
[2:23:20] when you look you say i am the voice
[2:23:22] crying in the wilderness yes it's me
[2:23:25] oh no you are john no it is me
[2:23:31] john
[2:23:32] is my family name
[2:23:35] but my true identity
[2:23:37] is the voice crying in the wilderness
[2:23:41] [Applause]
[2:23:41] [Music]
[2:23:44] are you there it is written in mysteries
[2:23:49] that's why you don't chase brother
[2:23:52] branham by the name brother branham in
[2:23:54] the bible
[2:23:57] [Music]
[2:23:59] [Applause]
[2:24:08] so your name
[2:24:10] contains a mystery that
[2:24:13] entire life
[2:24:15] and when god called that mysteries
[2:24:22] brother branham say the sweetest sound
[2:24:26] that a man can heal is the sound of his
[2:24:30] own name
[2:24:35] are you there
[2:24:37] but if i say the voice of the one crying
[2:24:40] in the wilderness does that sound good
[2:24:43] to your ear
[2:24:45] you want to be called
[2:24:47] benjamin
[2:24:49] the voice of the one crying in the
[2:24:50] wilderness
[2:24:53] oh i'm embarrassed everybody will be
[2:24:55] looking at me like the voice of the one
[2:24:56] or crying in the wilderness that's what
[2:24:58] you will say you want to be called ben
[2:24:59] brother benjamin right but when god
[2:25:02] calls
[2:25:04] amen to tell you that it's your name
[2:25:07] you're gonna feel something in your
[2:25:09] heart
[2:25:11] that is rejoicing
[2:25:13] like wow
[2:25:14] that is good you are hearing your name
[2:25:19] [Applause]
[2:25:21] he doesn't say divine
[2:25:24] it is the word that is sweeter to your
[2:25:28] heart
[2:25:29] until you feel like i just want to be
[2:25:31] that that is you
[2:25:35] [Applause]
[2:25:38] and it's coded under the message of your
[2:25:41] hour
[2:25:42] so when the message has been preached
[2:25:44] somebody else stood up and said praise
[2:25:47] the lord
[2:25:48] that's me
[2:25:51] what you heard you heard my ego
[2:26:00] hallelujah
[2:26:01] the people might be around you they
[2:26:03] can't hear nothing but you heard
[2:26:05] something
[2:26:07] what you heard that is your name that
[2:26:10] was written in the book of life
[2:26:13] [Music]
[2:26:18] why when they call your name you respond
[2:26:21] why did you respond to god
[2:26:24] what makes you respond to god that which
[2:26:27] made you respond to god that's your name
[2:26:30] [Music]
[2:26:33] that which make you stop smoking
[2:26:36] and stand up and begin to go that was
[2:26:39] your name
[2:26:40] it is written in mysteries and it's
[2:26:43] unfolding to you that's why the new
[2:26:46] birth is a personal revelation of jesus
[2:26:50] christ to you
[2:26:56] hallelujah
[2:26:58] my god
[2:26:59] where are we
[2:27:04] my god
[2:27:05] so
[2:27:06] you were sons of god and daughters of
[2:27:10] god before there even was a moon
[2:27:13] star of molecule you are sons and
[2:27:15] daughters of god for you are only the
[2:27:18] physical manifestation of the attribute
[2:27:21] that was in god at the beginning
[2:27:24] you don't know nothing about it
[2:27:26] neither did you know when you was
[2:27:29] in your earthly father but you are
[2:27:31] manifested in his image
[2:27:34] like liver
[2:27:35] amen in the image of god you are made
[2:27:38] and you were manifested for the
[2:27:41] and
[2:27:43] of god
[2:27:44] the children were making too much noise
[2:27:47] everybody clear and therefore as sure as
[2:27:50] your chin
[2:27:52] had to be in your father
[2:27:55] your natural breath
[2:27:56] your spiritual water
[2:27:59] had to be in who
[2:28:01] because you are an expression of the
[2:28:05] attribute of its thoughts before the
[2:28:08] foundation of the world
[2:28:10] no way around that that is right
[2:28:17] so the thoughts of god are real
[2:28:20] the thoughts of god are human
[2:28:25] [Music]
[2:28:35] amen
[2:28:36] who's producing the vessels of mercy you
[2:28:39] understand this now he had now
[2:28:42] he have shrank himself from eternity
[2:28:45] and now he created space in eternity
[2:28:48] amen
[2:28:50] now he can move and be free
[2:28:52] then he have to give birth
[2:28:59] are you okay

[2:29:38] remember he met mercy he met abraham as
[2:29:41] melchizedek who came
[2:29:43] leave a move
[2:29:44] so when he morphing melchizedek
[2:29:48] he's calling for liver
[2:29:51] but liver can come out just like that so
[2:29:54] automatically abraham pops out
[2:29:59] are you there
[2:30:00] then i say come out
[2:30:03] not in the natural we are in heaven

[2:30:15] and then people leave a stand
[2:30:17] and when he stands for some reason moses
[2:30:20] come

[2:31:01] they created space in eternity now not
[2:31:04] only him is playing you together you are
[2:31:07] playing

[2:36:18] this one can come
[2:36:20] you see
[2:36:22] it goes back god say what can i do
[2:36:28] because
[2:36:29] brother branham said he shrunk himself
[2:36:32] he came down into a pillar of fire and
[2:36:35] created everything an empty space around
[2:36:38] him and all the positives were combined
[2:36:41] in one place
[2:36:43] you understand
[2:36:44] because albert einstein brother branham
[2:36:46] said he saw that circle that center that
[2:36:48] if you contacted you can create world
[2:36:51] everything else was in the negative it
[2:36:53] was a void right about here by law of
[2:36:57] contrast
[2:36:58] you follow me
[2:37:00] god have to film the blanks
[2:37:02] everybody
[2:37:17] faith he too into an angel
[2:37:24] when he murphy we call him the angel of
[2:37:26] the lord
[2:37:29] but here
[2:37:30] then more free more fake game into an
[2:37:33] archangel
[2:37:35] [Music]
[2:37:39] i talked to even somebody last night
[2:37:42] about it he morphed into an archangel
[2:37:45] we're gonna i'm i'm laying the
[2:37:47] foundation then on wednesday we pick up
[2:37:48] the angelic beings and we continue to go
[2:37:51] when he did it the law of construst
[2:37:54] needed a different being
[2:37:57] that is coming
[2:37:59] to make the attribute of his being
[2:38:02] to be expressed
[2:38:05] everybody here
[2:38:06] because every time he was expressing
[2:38:09] himself he will create abraham
[2:38:12] eternal he created liver eternal he
[2:38:15] created jacob eternal he created when
[2:38:18] i'm talking about great i'm talking
[2:38:19] about the spirit that was coming there
[2:38:21] they were eternal he created jacob
[2:38:23] eternal liver came out eternal are you
[2:38:26] following me then he keep on and moses
[2:38:29] came out and then aaron came out all of
[2:38:31] them were coming eternal eternal but the
[2:38:34] law of conscience was requesting another
[2:38:40] kingdom you follow me
[2:38:43] and that kingdom
[2:38:45] god cannot create evil
[2:38:51] now slow down and
[2:38:53] stay tight
[2:38:54] god is pure
[2:38:56] 100
[2:38:58] god
[2:38:59] no shadow of light
[2:39:01] his full god
[2:39:03] amen
[2:39:04] but he have to create something to
[2:39:07] express the plan of redemption but if he
[2:39:10] create it's got to be first something
[2:39:13] that is good because it's coming out of
[2:39:15] him
[2:39:16] not really out of him
[2:39:19] but he have now to start
[2:39:21] manufacturing something that is not part
[2:39:24] of him
[2:39:28] are you following me
[2:39:30] are we following me then god looked
[2:39:34] he could not see anything in him that
[2:39:38] can be like that one
[2:39:41] you follow me then god
[2:39:43] have to begin to draw something
[2:39:47] that was not in him
[2:39:50] before the foundation of the world
[2:39:55] when he drew
[2:39:57] god pulled a being
[2:40:00] and the being began to come out
[2:40:03] god created him
[2:40:05] are you there
[2:40:06] he called this being
[2:40:09] the son
[2:40:10] of the morning
[2:40:21] everybody clear
[2:40:24] this being
[2:40:26] was not morningstar
[2:40:30] you follow me
[2:40:32] this being was not
[2:40:34] morning stars
[2:40:37] these
[2:40:38] are morning star and morning star
[2:40:42] these right here
[2:40:44] are not son of the morning stars
[2:40:50] forget this let me go back here
[2:40:53] this is morning star
[2:40:56] this is morning star
[2:40:58] this is not sun of the morning star
[2:41:02] this is god's
[2:41:04] these are gods
[2:41:10] they are not sons of god they are gods
[2:41:16] they are as good as this one is god
[2:41:21] remember i just show you they were
[2:41:23] eternal like brother branham says
[2:41:26] make sense but this one
[2:41:29] is not a morningstar but he is a son
[2:41:33] they have to birth him by creation
[2:41:42] hallelujah
[2:41:44] how they have fallen from heaven oh what
[2:41:47] son of what
[2:41:49] not mourning but son off
[2:41:54] are you there
[2:41:55] for they have said in the heart
[2:41:57] i will ascend into heaven
[2:42:00] i will be ex i will exalt my what
[2:42:04] he had the position
[2:42:06] above the weapon
[2:42:15] i will exalt my throne above the weapon
[2:42:19] the only one that was above the
[2:42:21] morningstar was the morning star himself
[2:42:30] because he
[2:42:32] is the father
[2:42:33] but this one came
[2:42:35] and want to take position and above the
[2:42:39] morningstar in other words he want to be
[2:42:42] like the morning star because he was not
[2:42:45] the morning star but he was the son of
[2:42:49] the morning
[2:42:53] origin
[2:42:55] i will ascend into heaven i will exalt
[2:42:58] my throne above the stars of
[2:43:02] i will sit also when you say also
[2:43:06] meaning somebody else is already there
[2:43:09] you want to copy him
[2:43:13] i was sick also upon the
[2:43:16] mount of the woo
[2:43:18] because he was god who was above his
[2:43:20] children he was looking at the
[2:43:21] congregation of his children playing
[2:43:23] around
[2:43:24] are you there
[2:43:25] in the side of the north i will ascend
[2:43:28] above the height of the cloud i will be
[2:43:30] like duh
[2:43:32] now you see here what he was looking for
[2:43:35] what does he mean remember brother
[2:43:37] branham say satan was a water
[2:43:41] a creature of water
[2:43:43] son of the world
[2:43:44] so son of the morning doesn't mean
[2:43:47] lucifer came from god
[2:43:50] his son by creation
[2:43:57] not by attribute
[2:44:03] are you there
[2:44:05] in other words between lucifer and the
[2:44:08] one who created there is no relationship
[2:44:12] by code by gene
[2:44:18] where are you getting this stuff
[2:44:21] john 14 chapter 30
[2:44:24] hereafter i will not talk to you i will
[2:44:27] not talk much with you
[2:44:29] for the who
[2:44:31] the prince of water
[2:44:32] who's the prince of this world
[2:44:35] the priest of this world lucifer cometh
[2:44:38] and he has what
[2:44:40] [Music]
[2:44:45] any question
[2:44:46] another word in god
[2:44:49] there is no representation of lucifer
[2:44:53] [Applause]
[2:44:56] there is nothing inside god
[2:44:59] that looked like lucifer
[2:45:03] when god looked at you
[2:45:05] he looked at him he finds you he look at
[2:45:08] you you are there he look at you you are
[2:45:11] there he look elizabeth no idea
[2:45:18] some
[2:45:19] by creation
[2:45:23] that's why brother branham said when the
[2:45:25] bible says that the sons of god
[2:45:28] looks at the daughters of god brother
[2:45:30] branham said those sons of god were not
[2:45:33] the true seed of god
[2:45:35] they were sons of god like lucifer
[2:45:39] sons of god by creation canaanite not by
[2:45:43] relationship
[2:45:50] god
[2:45:51] did not create him satan
[2:45:58] are you there
[2:45:59] god did not created him devil
[2:46:03] because satan cannot come out of god
[2:46:06] devil cannot come out of god god created
[2:46:10] him lucifer which means a ninja of light
[2:46:14] are you there
[2:46:16] he became devil
[2:46:18] devil means come from the greek word
[2:46:22] diabolos
[2:46:24] which means false accuser
[2:46:30] anything everybody okay
[2:46:32] and satan means adversary
[2:46:39] god cannot create a false accuser
[2:46:43] god created lucifer and brother branham
[2:46:47] said we will go down on wednesday lord's
[2:46:49] willing and you're going to see brother
[2:46:51] branham say god put them in free moral
[2:46:55] agency
[2:46:56] to choose what is right or what is wrong
[2:47:00] because what i'm saying heaven was
[2:47:03] created of was made of the word of god
[2:47:07] so god put his word
[2:47:09] and said this is it this is it this is
[2:47:12] it this is it everybody is created
[2:47:15] lucifer is created
[2:47:17] here is lucifer this is my word and he
[2:47:20] put him on free moral agency
[2:47:24] the problem with lucifer but what i'm
[2:47:26] saying he was called
[2:47:28] equal with god
[2:47:32] maybe on wednesday or dawn next sunday
[2:47:34] we're going to get down on those quotes
[2:47:36] brother branham said he was god's right
[2:47:38] hand man
[2:47:40] are you there
[2:47:41] him
[2:47:45] and michael could meet together
[2:47:50] not with god
[2:47:52] only when god is morphing michael
[2:47:58] we're gonna go there anybody clear
[2:48:01] anybody understanding
[2:48:02] so when god created him he put him in
[2:48:06] free moral agency
[2:48:07] brother branham said god gave him so
[2:48:10] much right and authority
[2:48:13] but he didn't understand
[2:48:16] what he means by being under one head
[2:48:23] lucifer thought
[2:48:25] god is democratic
[2:48:33] in first john chapter 3
[2:48:36] not as who
[2:48:38] who was of the world
[2:48:40] who was the wicked one in the garden of
[2:48:42] eden
[2:48:47] one scripture
[2:48:49] was adam the wicked one
[2:48:51] was if the wicked one the bible say adam
[2:48:53] was the son of god in luke chapter 3 38
[2:48:57] but the bible says ken was of the wicked
[2:49:00] one who was wicked in the garden of eden
[2:49:05] came who was one of the wicked one and
[2:49:08] threw his water
[2:49:13] hallelujah
[2:49:15] amen
[2:49:16] now when lucifer was created
[2:49:19] god also created
[2:49:22] his children
[2:49:28] let me hit this so we can let you go
[2:49:30] home
[2:49:32] john chapter 8 38
[2:49:34] 39
[2:49:35] the answer and say unto him abraham is
[2:49:38] our word
[2:49:40] jesus said unto them if you were abraham
[2:49:44] what
[2:49:45] you will do the works of who
[2:49:52] [Music]
[2:49:55] but now you seek to do what
[2:49:58] a man that had told you the truth
[2:50:01] which i have heard of who
[2:50:04] this did not who
[2:50:14] is it a different bible
[2:50:17] don't say dead to him
[2:50:19] we be not born in fornication we have
[2:50:22] one father who
[2:50:25] they thought they came from god
[2:50:31] because they were jew
[2:50:34] but they didn't come from god
[2:50:37] even though they were jew
[2:50:42] jesus said unto them if god were you
[2:50:47] you would do what
[2:50:49] because i would have been with you in
[2:50:51] eternity
[2:50:53] are we okay now is he clicking now
[2:50:56] when we were in eternity it was only
[2:50:59] perfect love
[2:51:01] we were loving each other with my
[2:51:04] children up and down playing but what
[2:51:07] you are expressing
[2:51:10] over there i never seen it you want to
[2:51:12] see what brother branham did spoke about
[2:51:15] why lucifer cannot even enter the sixth
[2:51:17] dimension
[2:51:19] i heard the quote i could not put it up
[2:51:22] if god were your father you would love
[2:51:25] me for i proceeded forth and came from
[2:51:27] who
[2:51:29] neither can i of myself but he sent me
[2:51:32] why did he not understand my speech
[2:51:37] even because he cannot hear my
[2:51:40] year of your fatherhood
[2:51:42] [Music]
[2:51:46] thank you very much
[2:51:49] and the last of your father you would do
[2:51:52] he was a water
[2:51:54] from the water
[2:51:55] now you understand why ken can kill
[2:52:05] keep in mind they cannot abide in the
[2:52:08] truth they can be in the truth but they
[2:52:11] won't stay in the truth later on i'm
[2:52:14] going to show you that
[2:52:16] i wish i had more time
[2:52:18] they can start
[2:52:20] but they won't remain
[2:52:22] they can be in the book of life
[2:52:25] but their name war
[2:52:30] because there is no truth in water
[2:52:34] when he speaks
[2:52:36] a lie he speaks of what
[2:52:39] i didn't create him like that for he is
[2:52:42] huh
[2:52:43] and a father of it
[2:52:45] he that is of god heareth god's word
[2:52:49] ye therefore hear them not
[2:52:51] because
[2:52:53] [Music]
[2:52:57] i went all the way there
[2:52:59] then when it come to the office you're
[2:53:00] gonna see what happened in the earth
[2:53:03] let's head to the airport
[2:53:06] the field is the world the good seat out
[2:53:08] there
[2:53:10] of the kingdom but the tears are the
[2:53:12] children of the world
[2:53:14] who's the wicked one
[2:53:16] the enemy has some that sown them is
[2:53:19] there
[2:53:22] matthew 23
[2:53:24] then shall the king say unto them on the
[2:53:26] right hand come ye blessed of my father
[2:53:29] inherit the kingdom prepare for you
[2:53:33] from the foundation of the
[2:53:35] they are blessed
[2:53:37] but 41 then shall he say also unto them
[2:53:42] on the left side the remember the right
[2:53:45] side is
[2:53:46] lamb and the other one is
[2:53:49] depart from me ye what into everlasting
[2:53:54] prepare for who
[2:53:56] and his
[2:53:58] we're going to understand who are those
[2:53:59] angels
[2:54:03] because we thought he was only angelic
[2:54:05] being
[2:54:06] amen
[2:54:07] so by the attribute of the lion
[2:54:10] god
[2:54:12] have to express his wrath
[2:54:14] these right here
[2:54:16] became children
[2:54:18] of wrath
[2:54:22] let me drive couple and i'll go home
[2:54:26] proverbs 16 verse 4
[2:54:28] the lord has made all things for himself
[2:54:33] yeah even there
[2:54:36] for the day of what
[2:54:43] [Music]
[2:54:45] they didn't create them for glory
[2:54:52] because he is a lion he have to express
[2:54:54] his wrath he needed somebody to express
[2:54:58] his word that's why death in the
[2:55:00] scripture this morning say turn their
[2:55:02] table
[2:55:03] turn their habitation
[2:55:06] remove them from the book of life
[2:55:08] they are unredeemable
[2:55:14] for these are there are certain kept in
[2:55:16] anywhere who will be followed or dead to
[2:55:19] this water
[2:55:21] before the foundation of the world or
[2:55:23] then predestinated
[2:55:25] to be condemned
[2:55:27] amen
[2:55:30] men turning the grace of our god into
[2:55:32] water
[2:55:34] they have a power of perversion by their
[2:55:36] father
[2:55:37] and denying their only lord god and our
[2:55:40] lord jesus christ
[2:55:42] while i was with them in the world i
[2:55:46] kept them in that name those that that
[2:55:48] gave us me i have kept
[2:55:51] and none of them is what
[2:55:53] but the son of water
[2:55:55] how did he become the son of perdition
[2:55:58] we will get it down the road
[2:56:00] that the scripture might be what
[2:56:03] jesus answered them
[2:56:05] have not i chose u12
[2:56:12] the choosing yes i am the one who did it
[2:56:16] amen
[2:56:17] amen
[2:56:19] and one of you is what
[2:56:26] who was he talking about he speak of who
[2:56:30] how can a human being be a devil
[2:56:35] because devil are spirit
[2:56:38] right
[2:56:39] but he looked at a human being he said
[2:56:41] you are a devil
[2:56:43] how can a human being be a devil
[2:56:46] we usually think devil are demons
[2:56:52] his speck of judas is carrying the son
[2:56:55] of simon for he he was that should
[2:56:57] betray him being one of the twelve
[2:57:01] lord help me
[2:57:03] man has always tried to do something to
[2:57:06] save himself
[2:57:08] there is nothing you can do about it
[2:57:13] god save you unconditionally
[2:57:18] [Applause]
[2:57:18] [Music]
[2:57:20] he just calls you
[2:57:23] you remember the name
[2:57:25] you remember the calling he just calls
[2:57:27] you
[2:57:28] predestinated you to be water
[2:57:33] and somebody predestinate to be what
[2:57:38] [Music]
[2:57:44] the bible says so manifold followed them
[2:57:48] to this condemnation
[2:57:50] lord help me lay this
[2:57:52] plane here
[2:57:54] there is no way of separating church
[2:57:57] natural
[2:57:58] and church spiritual
[2:57:59] but the church spiritual is the elect
[2:58:02] church because when god created lucifer
[2:58:07] and he created his children
[2:58:09] he caused a mixture in eternity
[2:58:12] we all begin to be mixed together
[2:58:16] they could not harm you yet
[2:58:18] because they were not expressed in the
[2:58:21] devilish kingdom yet
[2:58:23] so they were friends to you
[2:58:25] [Music]
[2:58:30] hallelujah
[2:58:32] call out and set aside by god and they
[2:58:35] are the one that will heal the word of
[2:58:37] god
[2:58:38] no matter how hard
[2:58:40] it seems strange to say but some men are
[2:58:44] predestinated to eternal
[2:58:49] we don't like to think those things but
[2:58:51] there is some people who will
[2:58:55] never be saved no matter what you do
[2:58:58] they are very religious
[2:59:00] [Music]
[2:59:06] they're not new to you here you were
[2:59:08] with them in eternity
[2:59:12] are you there
[2:59:14] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[2:59:16] lord job that the wicked is reserved for
[2:59:21] the day of what
[2:59:23] they shall be brought forth to the day
[2:59:25] of water because they predestinated to
[2:59:28] that he have to unleash his wrath but he
[2:59:30] can't do it on his child when he see
[2:59:32] john he changed into a lamb
[2:59:35] yet they say they lie on her
[2:59:38] are you there
[2:59:39] he that believes on the son of or on the
[2:59:42] son have everlasting life and he that
[2:59:44] believes not the son shall not see life
[2:59:47] but what
[2:59:51] the wrath of god abideth on what
[2:59:54] how can you see the sun if the sun
[2:59:56] doesn't make himself known to you
[2:59:58] raging wave of the sea forming out their
[3:00:01] own shame wandering water
[3:00:03] that's why when they get into the
[3:00:05] eternity and discipline children
[3:00:11] to whom is reserve water
[3:00:15] blackness of water
[3:00:17] forever
[3:00:19] and enoch also the seventh from adam
[3:00:22] prophesies of this saying behold the
[3:00:25] lord cometh with ten thousand to do what
[3:00:28] to execute water
[3:00:33] a stone of stumbling
[3:00:36] a rock of who even to them which
[3:00:39] stumbled at the
[3:00:41] being disobedient whereunto also they
[3:00:44] were
[3:00:45] they were appointed not to obey the word
[3:00:48] of god

[3:00:53] no one will rise from the dead yet he
[3:00:56] will not believe that is what jesus said
[3:00:58] in luke 16

[3:01:05] not to believe
[3:01:10] no matter what you do they will not
[3:01:12] believe it anyhow

[3:01:17] purpose

[3:01:21] and still pharaoh can get it
[3:01:25] finished aren't you happy tonight that

[3:01:55] being who

[3:01:58] blessed be the name of the lord
[3:02:00] why to use crab and pharisee

[3:02:05] land to make one proselyte and when he's
[3:02:08] made you make him twofold more the child

[3:03:39] lord there is a cup and the wine is red
[3:03:42] it's a full of mixture and he poured out
[3:03:44] the same but they dragged thereof all

[3:14:11] father it was a lot of lengthy but we're
[3:14:13] just trying to get to a point for your
[3:14:15] children to realize who they are
[3:14:18] that they came from the very launch of
[3:14:21] abraham
[3:14:22] from the very loans of elohim the very
[3:14:25] longs of god
[3:14:26] father and they are no different than
[3:14:29] you
[3:14:30] father these things are difficult

[3:14:38] these things and accept them
[3:14:41] but lord we thank you because you were
[3:14:43] you didn't mean those things
[3:14:45] to be interpreted by our brain
[3:14:48] because with our brain we cannot even
[3:14:50] figure it out who you are but lord
[3:14:52] father you have predestinated those
[3:14:54] things
[3:14:55] to pass the brain and to go down deep in
[3:14:58] the heart
[3:14:59] and in the heart you put a receiver that
[3:15:02] can accept the word
[3:15:04] no matter how irreasonable unreasonable
[3:15:07] that looks oh that seems to be further
[3:15:10] but still deep in our soul we know that
[3:15:12] something is positing and saying that
[3:15:15] this is the truth
[3:15:17] lord your prophet keep talking about if
[3:15:20] the bride recognizes who she is
[3:15:22] father we are not different by the very
[3:15:24] gene of you we are the very attribute
[3:15:27] that came from you there is no dna test
[3:15:30] that can be given that will deny our
[3:15:32] relationship and our origin lord father
[3:15:36] and our connection with you we were
[3:15:38] connected with you since eternity we
[3:15:40] always existed with you and you
[3:15:42] permitted us to bypass our theophany so
[3:15:45] that we can drop down in this world to
[3:15:48] be developed lord father into the image
[3:15:50] of the living god father lord jesus
[3:15:53] christ may you help your children

[3:16:13] are your possession you own us you are
[3:16:16] our lord and you are taking
[3:16:18] responsibility to start this journey all
[3:16:21] the way to the end father i commit
[3:16:23] everybody unto this voice lord unto the
[3:16:26] hand lord if there is somewhere they are
[3:16:29] struggling and the devil has been
[3:16:31] beating down on them lord father

[3:16:40] may they rise up as sons of god lord and
[3:16:43] realize that they were not meant for
[3:16:45] this low cheating hypocritical life but

[3:16:54] fellowship that they have with their
[3:16:56] lord and be the salt of this earth lord
[3:16:58] and to be exactly what you intended them

[3:28:51] the lord told joseph
[3:28:54] giving for everybody but for the levi
[3:28:58] i am the porsche to satisfy them
[3:29:01] but maybe you don't have many things
[3:29:07] because god knows that the only
[3:29:10] the only thing that satisfy your soul
[3:29:13] is
[3:29:15] the person that satisfies your soul
[3:29:17] [Music]

[3:29:24] glory to god we are the we are the the
[3:29:27] uh the spiritual real priesthood levites
[3:29:33] glory to god
[3:29:34] that
[3:29:36] uh according to the uh
[3:29:38] one of the scriptures that brother
[3:29:40] stephen read today
[3:29:42] this is what the prophets
[3:29:44] and the just they don't know
[3:29:48] but you know
[3:29:50] today
[3:29:52] it was breaking the spiritual amnesia
[3:29:56] it's not amnesia
[3:29:57] the tunnel of the amnesia is broken
[3:30:00] right now
[3:30:02] you know that you know that you know
[3:30:06] is is thing that you know
[3:30:09] that
[3:30:10] sometimes do you think that you don't
[3:30:12] know
[3:30:14] but you know what you don't know
[3:30:17] glory to god
[3:30:19] this is god's language
[3:30:21] this is what uh uh brother stephen was
[3:30:24] preaching today
[3:30:25] the thing that you know but you don't
[3:30:27] know
[3:30:29] but you know
[3:30:31] praise the lord
[3:30:35] hallelujah
[3:30:36] you've been identif you've been
[3:30:38] identified with him
[3:30:43] it was so many things that
[3:30:45] jesus don't know but jesus know
[3:30:47] everything
[3:30:52] you
[3:30:52] sometimes you forget certain things
[3:30:55] [Music]
[3:30:56] because god
[3:30:58] he got an attribute
[3:31:02] he
[3:31:04] can't forget
[3:31:06] that's another
[3:31:07] attribute
[3:31:08] and when he want to forget or forget or
[3:31:13] you know
[3:31:14] your sins
[3:31:15] [Music]
[3:31:17] he never saw he said
[3:31:19] lord forgive me for this i say i forget
[3:31:23] i don't know what you're talking about
[3:31:26] then you got the same attribute
[3:31:28] and today
[3:31:30] today
[3:31:31] it's been so open
[3:31:34] you know when
[3:31:36] [Music]
[3:31:38] they're in puerto rico when somebody was
[3:31:41] a
[3:31:42] weak or
[3:31:44] a woman delivered a baby
[3:31:46] you know she was so tender
[3:31:49] and they they giving certain soup
[3:31:52] to raise to to give a strength
[3:31:55] and
[3:31:56] it's certain
[3:31:58] uh it's a certain inspiration
[3:32:02] for when you are a little bit weak
[3:32:05] and if it it made to thin
[3:32:08] they give it strength
[3:32:09] but when you take too much sometimes
[3:32:12] you feel like you'll go to rest
[3:32:15] too much food
[3:32:18] it makes certain reaction
[3:32:20] you know
[3:32:21] that
[3:32:22] if you feel like
[3:32:24] i feel a little bit uh
[3:32:26] sleepy
[3:32:27] it's it's too much food for you
[3:32:30] for certain people they feel so like
[3:32:33] like like jump and running and
[3:32:35] everything but if i oh no more soup is
[3:32:38] too much for me
[3:32:41] if you continue i think i'm gonna sleep
[3:32:44] because you know
[3:32:46] sometimes you need time to die yes
[3:32:49] and that's what's happening
[3:32:51] is is when god is talking to you
[3:32:55] you are captured by by that person
[3:32:58] the holy present
[3:33:00] is so many things
[3:33:02] that you came uh
[3:33:04] absorbed you you
[3:33:07] you don't know what you do sometimes
[3:33:10] you don't know if you run
[3:33:12] if you listen
