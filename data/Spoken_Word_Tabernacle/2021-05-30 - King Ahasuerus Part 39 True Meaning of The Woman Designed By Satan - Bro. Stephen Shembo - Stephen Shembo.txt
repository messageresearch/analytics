jesus is here jesus [Music] jesus is here all things are possible [Music] jesus jesus jesus is here all things are possible [Music] jesus amen let's give the lord the clap of princess amen everybody happy this morning you don't follow the zodiac outside because the zodiac look a little bit gloomy but it's a beautiful day amen so if you live in the other court so you're going to be affected by the light of the zodiac so whatever happened if the atmosphere is gloomy then you get gloomy yourself so don't be gloomy stay into the holy of the holiest amen the holy of the holiest regardless of what is going on outside you're still happy and you still keep your relationship with god amen how many are up today to with the sermon up to date up to date up to date praise god i don't want to lose anybody amen all right we already finished proverbs 7. that should be clear lord's willing at the end of the service just remember the building funds offering today and also for those that requested the cod we already bought them and some of you already got them but if you have not gotten them yet at the end of the service you can see the trustees but my daily or brother chimp they can hand you the cod so now remember we spend money on this it's an investment all i'm asking you is at least one question a day just one if i say two three it's gonna be a burden for somebody just at least one question a day one question one answer a day so by the end of the month you should have 30 questions and 30 answers if you do that in two months you're going to see how much you're going to be progressing and you're going to be growing with the lord amen i can give you the answer which we will continue to do but i want you to begin to learn from the source that we're getting in we are not the catholic church where the priests have a different book versus the congregation here we use the same bible and the same message amen but i don't want you to get lazy i want you to be working on your own i want you to put a tip and know how you can clean something from the tab i want you to learn how to read your bible i want you to learn how to go to the prophet and say we heard about this is there any place in the message where brother branham spoke about this then when you begin to study then the lord will open up to you if you're not interested on what the lord is doing he's not going to come and tell you the meaning of what his word is is actually so you gotta be interested convinced then concerned amen blessed be the name of the lord let's go to our reading i trust by the grace of god we're going to reach the point because the last time we we stopped where the woman was designed by the devil you remember that amen so there are many theories in the message amen so we had to go back to proverbs 7 to um we will see how the lord will lead and make sure we get into this completely amen genesis chapter 2. when brother polycarp touched chapter 3 i say okay that's my confirmation that i'm in the right line amen a wonderful sermon on wednesday if you were not there you need to go back and listen to it it's a blessing upon blessing brother darrell brother polycarp and it will continue to unfold amen genesis chapter 2 verse 7. make sure you don't sleep because i will remind you amen this is in the morning it's not even wednesday night or evening where you are tired from work this is fresh so make sure you don't sleep especially young people genesis chapter 2 verse 7. if you're there you can say amen and the lord god form a man we know that man was already created in genesis 1 26 we already clear on that one and the lord god formed men of the dust of the ground this is the natural the physical man and breathed into his nostril the breath of life and man became a water a living soul right here you might be seated god already created the earth and when god created the planet earth gotta kill it this is not working probably run out where is brother kelly it shall be somewhere amen all right let me continue when god created the earth the earth was already filled with the animal we know in genesis 1 it tells you how god created the the botany life the animal life and everything and the fishes and all this kind of stuff now right here god created man not the spiritual man but the natural man out of the earth and the bible says as we're waiting on those uh sharpies on uh verse eight thank you sister appreciate it i'm glad you knew where that was amen god created the earth we have planet earth the planet earth is already filled here everybody clear verse 8 and the lord planted a garden eastward in eden so there is a certain location on the earth that location is called eden anybody clear then inside the eden everybody clear so far god planted a garden toward the east so we can put it here like there is a garden somewhere here which one we call the garden of eden amen verse 8 and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put man whom he had formed now if you look right here you have three circles we have the earth itself then we have the region of eden which was connected to the region of nad which way was where uh can when and that's where the lineage of cain lived and then inside of hidden there is the garden of eden amen there is a first circle there is a second circle and there is a third circle everybody clear so far amen so the earth was the other court i hope you are seeing that everybody clear so far then eden was the holy place everybody cleared so far then the garden of eden was the holy of the holiest anybody clear because that's where the lord descended inside and that's where they carry them well that's why when moses made the tabernacle he put the caribbean on the holy of the holiest everybody cleared so far the opening of the seventh year the bible became anew praise god hallelujah and out of the ground verse 9 out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree this ground is not the ground of the earth everybody this is the ground of the garden of eden everybody clear because god already filled the earth with animal with vegetation with fishes and all kinds of stuff but god just created a natural man and now his creation he he's making a home for that natural man and that home was in the holy of the holiest that's where god wanted men to live not in the other court not in the holy of holi in the holy place but in the holy of the holiest so now it's another creation within the creation everybody clear he is creating the garden of eden hallelujah and out of the ground the ground of eden may the lord god to grow every tree that is water pleasant to the sight and that is water so in the in the earth there was all kind of trees here on the outside but the trees in the garden of eden were different the tree of the garden of eden were first what pleasant to the eyes and number two they were water they were also good for food everybody clear good for food amen if you leave the garden of eden you go outside then you can find all kinds of trees you can find field trees that are combustible good for food or you can find trees that are not combustible they are not good for food but specifically inside the garden of eden every single tree was water and water even the tree of knowledge of good and evil [Music] everybody cares of her that tree also was water and it was water do you believe it do you believe it do you want to see that in the bible you want to see that in the bible keep your finger right there let's go to genesis 3 because i'm going to read there anyway everybody clear job to verse 6 and when the woman saw that the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was water ever clear and welcome let's go back again every tree in eden was water and water including the tree of good of the knowledge of good and evil we clear now so let's go back on ourselves hallelujah amen every tree that is pleasant to the eyes and good for food the tree of life also pleasant to the eyes good for food in the midst of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil which we also saw that that tree was good for food and water pleasant to the eye everybody cleared so far job to verse 16 and the lord god commanded this is the first commandment that was given by god number one right here we have a commandment that is given by god the first one given to man what is god speaking and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden you may do what in other words when you enter the garden whatever you found there eat it amen no question there is no poison there anybody clear part of the tree of the knowledge of good and water even though that tree is pleasant to the eye and good for food that's the only tree i don't want you to touch it anybody clear oh i wish i can grab into ezekiel hallelujah amen part of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not do water eat of it for in the day that you eat thereof you shall surely water so that tree of the knowledge of good and evil is connected to death so there is the tree of life connected to life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil connected to what death everybody clear but god's original spoken word everybody clear god word god commandment in the garden of eden was do not touch the tree that is connected to death that is the gospel given to adam one one gospel do everything you want in eden do everything you want to eat in eden you can go and eat and sleep everywhere you want the only commandment to remain alive in eden do not touch on one tweet just one tree that's one tree that was the message of the hour that's it as long as adam keep one commandment nothing can happen to him adam didn't have to keep genesis leviticus numbers and and corinthians second corinthians no only one that everybody clear and the lord god verse 18 said it is not good that man should be alone i will make him here help meet for him in other words he is loved he's he's not having a companion verse 19 and out of the ground it looks like god is creating the second time because in in uh in uh chapter two at the beginning the bible say god rested but it looks like god is creating it is not that god is creating again here he's working in eden in the garden anybody clear and adam out of the ground god the lord god formed every beast of the field and every file of the air and brought them to adam to see what would uh what what he would call them and whatsoever adam called every living creature that was the name thereof and adam gave name to our caddo and to the fall of the earth and to every beast of the water of the field but for adam there was not found a help meet for him now the creation of the woman and the lord god caused a deep sleep because he needed a deep anesthesia they got to perform a surgery he can't feel the pain he caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs who's doing this work do you see the devil here what were we preaching in the message before amen and close up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which satan took the weed which the lord god has taken from man made he a water and brought her to who a man who took the woman to the man in other words when god had to perform marriage god took his own daughter as a father and god walked his own daughter to the owl do you follow me and when god asked who is giving this woman into marriage and god himself said i god i am giving this woman into marriage must be walked by your legal guardian or your [Music] head i'm saying that because there was a question and answer in our house meeting amen even eve has to be worked by her father in marriage in the scripture hallelujah for this church amen brought to her to men and adam say this is now born of my bones and flesh of my species and she shall be called water woman because she was taken out of men verse 25 and they were above water and the man and his wife and were not what so no matter what eve could do in front of adam adam was blind he could hug adam hey how are you doing nothing happened because the black dog was closed let's go to chapter 3 hallelujah now the serpent wants more water remember that word now we already dealt with but i'm gonna break it down again then any beast of the field which the lord god has made and he said to the woman yea has god say you shall not eat of every tree of the garden if you watch that question have the word not n o t amen if you ask the question can we eat off the tree of eden they will tell you you can eat everything anybody clear but the devil says can you can you eat not in other words the devil was asking of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil he was very specific everybody clear so far god gave a commandment do not touch the tree of the knowledge of good and water and the devil the first attack that he comes is against the very spoken word of god everybody here so far the first attack of the desert is against the spoken word the spoken word of god giving for your time if god gives you a when the devil comes he's going to fight the end if god gives you b then the devil comes he's not gonna fight b he's gonna fight he's not gonna fight a he's gonna fight b because b is your protection for the hour hallelujah and the woman said to the serpent we may eat of every tree of the trees of the garden part of the tree of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said you shall not eat it neither shall you touch it unless you do what number four second attack and the serpent say to the woman you shall not surely water the second attack of the devil is to prove you that the spoken word of god is alive number one the devil bring question against the spoken word of god number two he's gonna show you that what the spoken word of god gave you is not really the truth and the reason he does this is to get you out of the box once he fulfilled the first one bring question in the message of the hour then the second one proved to you that it's not what he was said the third attack he's going to bring you his gospel now these two are a way to open the door it's written in your scripture verse five and god does know now he's preaching in other words when he started he said no no no no no you guys don't understand what's going on really so tell me serpent tell me then he said okay sit down let me break it down now for you [Music] hallelujah for god does know that in the day you eat there often then your eyes shall be watered and you shall be as water knowing good and water adam could sit down if could be even testing before adam naked disease and adam is just sitting there like nothing happened the devil said those kind of behaviors are not good i'm gonna give you a gospel that's gonna make you see eve in a different light hallelujah verse six and the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that he was pleasant to the eyes a tree to be water and the beginning eve could pass that tree and never desire them but since the devil broke the first line the second line on the third one automatically he begin to thirst she begin to touch yeah give me more of this yeah begin to tell us give me more videos of this yeah do you have more proof of this of what you're telling me that it was wrong that it was a lie yeah give me more evidence hallelujah and to make one wise she took off the fruit the rough one and did it now she's doomed and gave also to her with her and he did what who gave adam the tree who gave the woman the tree so the serpent could not come straight to adam and hand to him his gospel the gospel of the serpent have to use the woman channel the woman channel sister hallelujah job to verse 17. and adam and to adam this is god bringing judgment if you watch god started from the serpent from the bottom first from the root then he moved to eve then to adam in other words from the origin then to the one he was handed to then to the other one now to adam what's going on and to adam ever here he said who's saying i want you to listen to this very carefully and to adam god said because you have hearken to water let me start again because you have hearkened to utter the voice of your wife who was the wife of adam so eve had a voice eve had a voice the voice of eve amen and that voice of evil is not the original voice of eve everybody following me it is the voice of the devil giving to the serpent and that voice immorphed into eve in other words eve had a voice or eve had the gospel the voice of designer everybody clear because adam you were hurting to the voice of eve he was eve that removed the veil from adam the devil never took the veil off of adam the devil removed the veil from eve and then finished his job and he ran away and he sat down then eve took the teaching of satan and goes to adam and begin to remove the there from adam that's why god is saying that because adam you have listened to the gospel of eve because you have hearken to the voice of your wife and have eaten off the tree the voice of eve presented to adam the tree of which i commanded you it was eve that brought the gospel contrary to the spoken word to adam make sense now amen saying you shall not eat curses the ground for your sake in sorrow shall you eat of it all the days of europe in eden two trees the devil attacked the spoken word by bringing question number two deny the spoken word and number three bring his gospel and deliver it once he delivered that gospel become the gospel of eve now eve had a voice let's go to genesis 15. you stay awake because we're going to use this we are building the platform before we get in your heart here if i give you scripture about her here you won't get it you'll think that it's a legalistic approach just like we kill christmas and earrings and all this kind of stuff the same way we go into the root so you get it from there and the whole tree is gonna be down amen let's go to genesis chapter 15. if everybody's there you can say amen after these things the word of the lord came to abram in a vision saying fear not abram i am your shield and your exceeding great reward and abram say to the lord say i'm sorry lord god what will you give me seeing a god childless and the steward of my house is this eliezer of damascus in other words god when he began to talk to abraham abraham told him he said father you gave me everything but you didn't give me a baby and the only one i can see that can inherit everything that i have is eliezer this man from damascus amen verse three and abram said behold to me you have given no seed and lo one born in my house is my heir elias i was born here seen him when he was born and he grew up i train him and he is a faithful servant that's the reason why i believe when i die the one who's going to take over is earliest of damascus because you didn't give me a child now god is going to talk to abraham verse 4 and behold the word of the lord came to him saying this eliezer of damascus shall not be your you are appointing me any yes of damascus for me to give him the blessing of abraham that is not what i'm talking about not earliest but he that shall come forth out of your own water shall be your the spoken word given to abraham the original spoken word given to abraham was telling abraham that you gonna have a child and we know that child should come bahu by sarah if you need scripture you see me everybody clear that is the original program of god do you follow me the original program of god abraham is gonna have a hell abraham is going to have a baby abraham is going to have a child and that child will come through sarah that is god program that said that is the safe the lord let's go to chapter 16. everybody clear so far everybody clear so far i hope nobody's sleeping here praise god verse one everybody clear watch verse 116. now sarah abraham's wife is the wife of adam somebody called it somebody called it can i start it again sarah the wife of who if the wife of who everybody okay anybody clear sarah the wife of abraham bought him

girl from egypt you follow me and edgar came and begin to live with abraham when abraham called aegon he said hey girl she always won master and she goes like this must abraham you say i need water yes master she goes run when she approaches abraham she even comes like this and give abraham order and run away everybody clear when i abraham sat down abraham could watch a girl taking the water to the bathroom taking the water to the kitchen abraham never thought about the nakedness of anger are you following me when abraham sat there was a veil between abraham and ergon a girl could walk she could dance she could do everything in front of abraham abraham only watched edgar as a child there was a respect between abraham and edgar there was a distance between abraham and elgar there was a holy veil between abraham and edgar but somebody need to break the veil are we okay hallelujah let's go to verse two this is between the line when the opening of the seven seals hallelujah and sarah said to abraham who said to abraham who told sarah where did sarah learn that the bible becoming you and sarah said to abraham behold now the lord has restrained me from water sarah is giving a gospel contrary to the spoken word gospel of god are we okay amen the lord has restrained me from bearing i pray you go into my water who is teaching abraham a new technique to have a child who taught adam to remove his own clothes hallelujah i preach on the headship i put the man back to each place i put on the sister you must be taken care by a man i gave you all the quotes now let's deal with something amen he may be no precision that a man of ten chanted by who who taught her that who taught her that if it's not from god there is only two sources who gave her that inspiration why is he the devil because it's contrary to the spoken word of god are you following me let's go and abraham how can you what can you read it loud abraham how can you what adam how can you what so sarah had a voice sarah had also a voice sarah had the gospel contrary to the original word of god are we okay and abraham hearken to the voice of who sarah about here so sarah sat down and called hegel say i said hey girl come here edgar come yes mrs she cannot look at him and sarah look he said chin up yes madam yes madam what do you want me what do you want me to do for you stop acting like a small girl

know i don't know how come i know no man she asked a question just like mary asked the question to gabriel amen mary say how can i deceive a child if i don't know any man so gabriel had to break the gospel but not by sex by the spoken word which is according to the prophecy in the old testament that said a virgin shall conceive the gospel of gabriel was in line with the original spoken word of god are you following me a girl is trembling sarah said don't worry i'm gonna teach you teach me what he said do this say madam madam say quiet take my clothing put it on you really madam yes take it don't worry stay there abraham is coming she goes back to abraham she said abraham chin up yes what do you want again i just told you i broke it down to you ah you know this girl we took her small child right i already prepare everything just go verse four verse three and sarah abraham wife took who who's doing all of that which anointing is on sarah hallelujah because the anointing you follow me upon if brought cain the gospel of eve produced cain are you following me and the gospel of sarah produce ishmael amen stay with the spoken word of god we don't want kind of this church we don't want ismail in this church that's why we must keep the spoken word pure verse three and sarah's abraham wife took anger and made the egyptian after abraham had dwelled 10 years in the land of canaan and gave her to her water abram and to be his water and he went into aegon broke the veil everybody clear and she did what just like eve conceived amen everybody clear and when a girl unites with abraham the eyes of edgar open up watch edgar now that girl that was so sweet that girl that was so obedient that girl that when she talked to sarah she was doing this that girl that was looking at abraham like this when sarah broke the veil her eyes open up what is the result everybody clear verse 3 and gave her husband verse 4 and he went to edgar and she conceived and when she who's that she hey girl so that she had done what her what was what in her water why who caused that in other words from there on when sarah said hey girl she looked at her in their eyes go get water why [Music] why are you talking to me like this yes me and abraham are doing the same thing matter of fact you're already old the trouble of the jews today are produced by the voice of sarah the trouble of this entire world today has been produced by the voice of evil everybody clear let's go to revelation chapter 2 blessed be the name of the lord the voice the voice of evil the voice of sarah now there is another voice anybody clear revelation chapter 2 verse 20 brother robert got it already you are behind you need to catch up make sure you don't sleep everybody clear revelation 220 in the tartarian teachings notwithstanding i have a few things against you everybody clear because you permit you have a loud the voice that woman who which got herself a what a teacher to do what and to what my servant to commit fornication and to each think sacrifice to adam there is a voice of jezebel the voice of jezebel and jezebel has a gospel and she's also teaching just like agar was taught just like adam was taught by a woman everybody go to revelation 3 verse 17. that church of laodicea there is another church which is called laodicea which is a woman because a church is a woman hallelujah if you read the churches the church of ephesus never said something ephesus was only spoken by god and rebuked by god the church of smyrna never spoke the church of pergamos never spoke in the church of that tyrion jezebel spoke in the midst of the church in the church of saudis nobody spoke it was god talking in the church of philadelphia nobody spoke but let's see the church of laodicea if the church is talking verse 17. you there because you what who's saying laodicea has a voice the voice of evil the voice of sarah the voice of jezebel the voice of loud this year because you say i am right yeah this year has a gospel of prosperity that's why your charismatic preachers your pentecostal preachers always measure in prosperity [Music] that is their gospel because you say i am water and increase with goods and have need of water it is a voice of indifference amen a voice that doesn't want rebuke a voice that doesn't want you to touch my life a voice that i know everything you can tell me i have to live my own life i have to take my own decision i don't need anything and no not an ignorant voice no not that you are water and water and what and what and what a voice that would let you go naked without you realizing you are naked it's a voice that removes respect on anger that abraham can remove his clothes and anger is comfortable amen everybody clear blessed be the name of the lord we on part 39 hallelujah we talk about this woman babylon jezebel and in proverbs 7 we saw that there was a harlot that attacked the young man and the young man was naive void of understanding and he met a woman that dressed like a harlot and we know jezebel is a harlot she's even the mother of harlot and then when the man that boy met the woman the bible says that the woman had a subtle heart brother branham says this in the serpent seal he said the serpent is the missing person between the chimpanzee and the men of course listen notice this that the serpent was not a reptile that was the curse that made him her a reptile he was most subtle of all the beasts of the field now i went and got dictionary today from everywhere to look up this word what the word of subtle mean it means to be water and to be wet so the serpent was very intelligent and that intelligence was mixed with craftiness it is an intelligence that can deceive you it is an intelligence that can it is a hypocritical intelligence it is an intelligence that can take you in the ways you won't realize until you are taken advantage of everybody clear there were many beasts in the garden of eden why did the devil choose this one because there was something in this beast that matches the devil everybody clear watch your character watch your behavior because your behavior can pull a spirit on you hallelujah it means to be smart to be crafty and the best interpretation of the hebrew from maha meha means having a true knowledge of the principles of water when brother branham spoke about the principle of life what the meaning really is that not only was the serpent smart not only was the serpent saddle but the serpent knew the principles of life in other words the serpent knew biology very well those who went to college if you look at your biology book you will see the right the principle of biology everybody clear bio means life are you following me bio means life logic means that study are you following me biology is the study of life in biology they taught you anonymity in biology they taught you how is your your skeleton how is your secretary system how is your respiratory system the devil the devil this serpent had every single knowledge of that are you following me and in the book of revelation the bible said the old devil the old serpent who is called there the devil not that the serpent was the devil but the devil incarnated into the serpent are you there and took opportunity of the knowledge that was in this beast the day for the serpent knew everything about a woman that is did not know because god blocked eve from the tree of knowledge of good and evil ever here the serpent knew things about adam that adam himself did not know about his own body the serpent was a phd in biology if you are blank if you don't know anything the devil can teach you everybody clear so far hallelujah brother branham says the pentecostal in this modern age that the bible predicted will be will be like the laodicea laodicea what about them explain this he says there is a greek teacher sitting here listening at me de la hodisha means a woman is the names is a woman's name in greek none of the rest of the church is represented by the name but now it is a water a welcome so brother branham explained to us that that voice that begin to speak in the tartarian edge is the same voice that is taking over in this age everybody clear so far that's right and we got rich we got need of nothing but don't know that we are naked blind and miserable walk out of the way what have we done we pick up some treasures maybe like judah did then we didn't work with it no more sold out for personal gain so many people do that so many denominations compromised upon the world in order to get more water and personal water they're worrying more about their finances than anything not knowing that they're preaching the very gospel of jezebel everybody clear so far in revelation 17 the bible says that there is a couple in the hand of the prostitute and that cup brother branham translated that it is the doctrine of the church brother branham what she have had in her hand her what what she's holding out to the people we are the church we are this and she's made the kings of the earth become drunk with her like that we are this we are the great power we sweep every nation we are the greatest church there is come on drink your flower pour out a little bit of it you take it you take it there it is and she had in her hand a cup in other words the cup that is in the hand of this woman is the doctrine by doctrine it is the very teaching doctrine means the teaching everything okay okay praise god can't you see that people that will adopt anything contrary to this word is the same didn't outfit bible in revelation 17 called the catholic church a whole a prostitute didn't he call the protestant the mother she was the mother of harlot the same thing she give out doctrine from her cup of water amen the teaching of babylon is filthy it is a teaching that breaks the field it is a teaching that removes respect it is a teaching that caused sarah to make abraham love a god amen hallelujah help us lord she give her doctrine from her cup of filthiness of the abomination of her fornication death and filth to make up of male men instead of the word of the living god which is true and water so this doctrine is the teaching of fornication everybody following me hallelujah why are you pondering on this woman everybody clear main door that the devil used to destroy and to propagate his seed has always been a woman let me start it again the reason why we are dealing with women there's reason why jezebel is a woman because from the garden of eden the woman is the weaker vessels because she was the product of the product and the devil knowing that having the true understanding of the principle of life when the devil want to destroy something when the devil want to bring his gospel and introduce his gospel the devil always uses a woman everybody following me i put back the men in their place i put back the sister in their place but we are dealing with an immoral woman anybody clear so far the man dawg ever used by the devil to destroy and to propagate his seed is through a woman anybody clear in the case of adam the devil used eve and adam listened to the voice of evil and brought trouble relax sister we'll be okay in the time of noah the bible says that the daughter of men became beautiful and they opened the door for god to bring judgment because violence was upon the earth everybody following me for abraham it took the voice of sarah to present them to abraham edgar and bring another gospel everybody following me in the time of joseph he took the wise from purify to bring a different gospel unto joseph is everybody awake hallelujah in the time of soul when soul was toward the end of his life son went to the witch of indo not the wizard the seed of sorcery was kept by a woman in handle the witch offender because so destroy all the witches in the land but that seed was protected by a woman everybody created so far in the time of david the devil uses worshipper to destroy david i better clear in the time of solomon the devil uses strange women to destroy the wisest man upon the press of the earth that's why when israel was going to the promised land god says this lest them make a covenant with the inhabitant of the land and they go a warring after their god and do sacrifice unto their god and one do what they invite you amen and die eat off the water so when you make covenant with people when you make friendship with people you are putting yourself in trouble if the people that are your friend don't believe like you because one of this day when they're gonna go to their sacrifice they will bring you an invitation you want to invite them to come to your church one day they will invite you and by constraint you're going to go visit them that's where they're going to get you that's why i preach on our friendship separate because when they invite you you never know what they therefore have for you everybody care and that damn make that take off the water until the sun and the daughter go away god is saying that when you begin to have friendship you will get comfortable you begin to invite one another and before you know it your son begin to last after a woman that is not of your church yes are you there you brought friend that don't believe the message you have a lot of friends that don't agree with the message you have friends that can speak on brother branham by going to visit one another all the time you are giving a message to your children that we are family are you there you are opening a door and your children will begin to get comfortable with the women of another religion jesus everybody following me their daughter unto the son why god is insisting not to give the daughter to the son the bible says and their daughter got a water a whoring after that and make that sun go away after that your son will not go directly to another it is the woman that's going to take your son to the idol because the devil uses that door to bring his seed or to destroy everybody close turn detroit uh deuteronomy 7 and when the lord that god if they will create a possibility you need to minimize your moving around it's disturbing the spirit if it's necessary you can go but stop moving around if it's unnecessary it's disturbing the spirit and when the lord that god shall deliver them before them that shall smite them and utterly destroy them and that shall make no covenant with them nor show mercy unto them why neither shall they make what marriages with them that daughter shall not give unto us his son know his daughter shall you take unto your son why for them we want who from following water because the devil always uses that door everybody cares so far amen in deuteronomy 17 that shall in any ways set him king over thee whom the lord that god shall choose among your brethren shall that set king over him that shall not set a stranger over thee which is not the brother neither shall he multiply what even the king of israel cannot multiply women like solomon why because that his heart turned not what it is the door used by the devil anybody clear let's go to second king chapter eight hallelujah we're talking about an immoral woman not your sister amen the second king chapter eight if you dare you can say amen the voice of eve hallelujah the voice of sarah the voice of jezebel which is the voice of laodicea why it is the door we know that israel split in two ten tribes went on the other side and the ten tribe made what they called the kingdom of israel he was made of ten tribes that's why jeroboam and ahab was there anybody here then the other two tribe the tribe of benjamin and the tribe of judah already explained it here remember on the number right it stays in the kingdom called the kingdom of judah everybody clear so far and we found out that the the number 10 was a carnal number amen and he was first in the kingdom of israel that jezebel entered when jezebel entered jezebel polluted the entire kingdom and destroyed all the seeds of god until elijah said father they have destroyed everybody i'm the only one remaining god said no there is still seven thousand ever clear but jezebel destroyed the prophet of god now the kingdom of judah was still spared because the kingdom of judah was right with god there was no entrance of jezebel into the kingdom of judah watch how the devil entered the kingdom of judah everybody cleared so far remember adam he took eve remember abraham he took sarah david he took bathsheba solomon he took women joseph they took the house of potiphar ever cleared for ahab they took jezebel insult jezebel and that said the whole kingdom is destroyed and judah won't steal and the protection and all they leave at if you study you will see all delivered move out and went to judah and brought protection now how is that seed getting into judah second king chapter eight if you dare you can say amen verse 16. everybody clear second king chapter 8 verse 16. the bible says this hallelujah and in the fifth year of jeremiah ever clear the son of who we're talking about the kingdom of israel ahab is in israel everybody clear ahab of israel kama jehoshaphat in the judah remember jehoshaphat always kept friendship with ahab do you follow me and their friendship got the children comfortable let me repeat it again because i keep saying about friendship you don't get it jesus affair was a good man that followed god ahab was already rejected by god was under the judgment of god and i proved to you here in this church that when jehoshaphat went to war he was almost killed when he came back god rebuked him from being closer to ahab he went again and began to do business with who the house of arab and god destroyed the business because he didn't listen the third time when they invited him he said no i'm not gonna do it but that relationship of jehoshaphat going visit ahab going visit aham taking his family to ahab the children got comfortable jehoshaphat saw the idolatry of israel and god was against that kingdom but he still want to keep fellowship they are believing their god they are doing their own thing but we still friend we still can eat together we still can fellowship together amen why jezebel is spitting upon elijah are you there israel was against the gospel of elijah and the other kingdom judah loved elijah but their relationship was kept we are still friends watch that friendship what he did you okay now let's go to verse 16. and in the fifth year of joram the king the son of ahab king of israel jehoshaphat being the king of judah jehoram the son of who jehoshaphat king of what begin to do what in other words jehoshaphat is dead his son reigned but remember that son used to go to the house of ahab you follow me watch what the parents produce parent delinquency are you there verse 17 30 and two years old was he when he began to reign and he ran eight years in jerusalem and he walked in the way of the kings of water how can a man that was raised in the kingdom of judah begin to act like the kingdom of israel his father was a just man a very good man god even protected him when he made an error but when his own son took over the throne he began to behave like the other kingdom what made his son to behave or to copy the bad kingdom you ready watch your scripture verse 18 and he worked in the way of the king of israel as did the house of who do you see your companion your friendship what he caused you thought you were visiting one another you thought you know the message you thought you can protect yourself you didn't see the vulnerability of your children in those environment that's why spoken word separated let me go and he does did the house of ahab watch verse 18 for the who the daughter of who the daughter of ahab was white the daughter of ahab was the daughter of jezebel so when jehoshaphat kept his relationship to keep his friendship he didn't see jezebel begin to look he called his daughter he said when you see the sons of jehoshaphat get here you need to make sure you clean okay okay remember what she did to jehu when she who was coming she painted her face and fixed yourself so when jehoshaphat was making a phone call hey this saturday we coming to visit you because it's memorial day jezebel called and say you know what make sure you put all your makeup you can get married you see are you are in a royal king i don't want you to marry peasant i want you to be married between the king and the king and the kingship okay so the daughter of jezebel were preparing making their makeup just like their mother and they were there then jehoshaphat came god bless you brother god bless you god bless you how are you doing no no we're not going to talk about your religion we know you rejected the message wake up the message so let's talk about business and the other stuff and then when the kids get together let's go to our bedroom and then they went to the bedroom amen then the daughter of jezebel begin to come and tend them and twist themselves jerorah was there he said i don't know over there it's just don't marry this don't do this this this woman is beautiful matter of fact from the beginning we used to be all israel now it's just the spirit that happened what is wrong the parent caused that and he ended up that the child of a righteous man married a daughter of a bad woman that god fed to the dog watch now what is that one woman doing to the whole kingdom of judah because the door that the devil uses is always uh let's go to verse 18 and he walk in the way of the king of israel as did the house of ahab for the daughter of ahab that's the king was his wife and he did evil in the sight of the lord yet the lord would not destroy judah for david his servant's sake as he promised him to give him always a light everybody there and to his children in his day what happened edom do you know who edom is esau but i'm saying he saw his you follow me in his day is so revolted the kingdom of judah already mastered the great prostitute they already mastered rome they already got protection against rome but a seed of jezebel entered there and unleashed and and released that spirit off the catholicism that was fought in the kingdom of judah was released that beast that was wounded got healed why through a woman they just took a package of a woman and send that to judah and that's it and the seed that was in israel entered judah now jezebel polluted the entire israel everybody clear in his day edom revolted from under the hand of the of judah and made a king over themselves so jerome jerome went over to zaire and all the chariot with him and he rose by night and smote the idol man which compassed him about he tried to control it and the captain of the chariot and the people fled into their tent yet despite every effort he tried to do yet edom revolted from under the hand of judah to this day then libna revolted the same everybody clear so far job to verse 27. everybody clear verse 26 two and 22 years and 20 years old was ahazya when he begin to reign and he ran one year in jerusalem remember the seed is already destroyed and his mother name was who italia the daughter of who omri king of israel and he walked in the way of the house of who and did evil in the sight of the lord as did the house of who why for he was the son-in-law to the house of who the daughter of jezebel begin to get married one by one to the kings the first king come the first daughter he dies the next king come there was another daughter that was already in preparation to keep that kingdom everybody clear so far so the key that we're getting here is the mandolin used by the devil to destroy and propagate his cities through the woman brother branham an analyst just from chicago good a woman wrote an article the police force that they chased down in the united states metropolitan united states that 90 watt nandi 98 of every crime that was ever did in any form in the united states there was either a water in it or a water if you don't find the cause to be the woman you will find behind the scene it was a woman 98 of crimes everybody watch the trouble in the churches somebody pop it up are you there if you see two families fighting fighting fighting are you there if you see a competition between families watch very closely who is behind that it is not a man it is usually a sister now what i'm saying all of this to get to one thing here at the end so that you can see what's the mother she was mad to deceive like she did who adam at the beginning tell him that the fruit was what and so forth to deceive him and take him away from water the devil just deposited everything to eve and he left the girl and eve took it and began to maneuver it that's why man is the one that preaches the gospel not the woman hallelujah to deceive him and take him away from the world that is the way the church does today same thing laodicea everybody clear you are my sisters see but look there is only one place in the whole universe that gives a man his credit that is god give it to him today the god of america is a woman now that's right strip one of these little women off and said then set them down here on the beach somewhere with their bathing suits on and she shall send more men to hell than all the bootleg joint john you got in the city that's right she's america's girl she makes men for anything she wants to the devil not that in the what i'm getting to your designing of the devil that is the reason he chose water you follow me now he understood that now the woman is redeemed and she can be a sister and godly but brother what we need today is some more good old-fashioned god sent holy ghost born mothers to raise children right talk about juvenile delinquency it is water that's what i just showed you the parents were visiting and something happened now brother stephen let's go to song of solomon chapter eight as we begin to get now you get the concept you got the door and let's see what's happening because of this that's why you seen the gospel is usually like it's tight to the sister it is god trying to protect the woman it is not god trying to be mean to a woman it is god understanding that the devil usually use that door that's why god brings a strong protection to the woman that's why the prophet came and said leave the sisters at home you brother go work because you are exposing that woman and the devil can attack her when you are not there just like she he attacking when adam was not around song of solomon chapter eight are you there we have verse eight we have a little water and she has no water it doesn't means that that would that sister doesn't have breast remember in ezekiel chapter 16 we found out that the breast of the woman was formed she was under puberty make sense amen so what the bible is saying here the sister is still the black dog is still close to this system make sense now if you didn't get ezekiel 16 you won't get this we have a little sister she has no breasts she's still too young the breast has not developed yet or grown yet what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall in the future be spoken of in other words there is a day that they're gonna talk about the sister now she's still little she doesn't have no breasts because she's under innocency but what the worry here is when she grows up and somebody is interested to marry her what are we gonna do in that day you understand now everybody clear now that's what probably the song of solomon is saying job to verse nine this book it's just the seals i'm following this thing let's go to nine if she be a water we already seen the window right the first possibility the sister is young somebody's sitting and watching he says she's young as soon as she's going to grow up and somebody will want to marry her what are we going to do in the day she want to get married now in the day somebody want to marry her there is two possibility we okay number one if she is a wall everybody clear number two if she is a door let's go back hallelujah if she be a white a woman if she is still an obstacle if she's still closed [Music] if she's firmly and successfully withstood all immoral approaches if she is still virgin hallelujah if she be a wall we will beat upon her a water a palace of silver we're gonna bring her a great reward we're gonna build an illustrious house on her because she kept herself a wow there was no penetration everybody clear because the virgin loves him you remember that do you remember that the woman that is not virgin paul said she lean more into the things of the lord are we okay karma and if she be a water it's happening now everybody care she already broke something we okay now the other one is the wow bread honor reward her the other one is already adorable she was playing with fornication if she be a dog we will tell everybody on facebook let me go back again if she be a dog we will do what enclosure with board of water we will protect that door and reinforce it very strong the board of cedar brother branham in the dedication of the building and then cedar woods pick off the water if she already opened a door to men she need to run to the cross [Music] she speaks of the cross the cross see the wood is white and got red stricken and the white speak of the water she need to be born again and the reds pick up the blood that made it righteous the cross was a curse curse is he that hang on a tree the cross was a curse until the blood of jesus christ poured on it then we embrace it in our heart for it is righteousness of god it is the righteousness of god it was the red that is in the cedarwood that makes the white water she needs to be protected by the blood it is in your book then see that wood is red over white red through red makes what you look through something red and something red it makes it water assemble that when god looks through the red blood of his son the lord jesus at our red scarlet scene they become white as water because she opened the door she need to be cleansed by the cross bring a protection to her under the token because her door was open satan will temper again because of that weakness you remember oliver and ahola the door were not closed by the cedar that's why they went back again ever clear job to verse 10. when solomon says that that in the day salomon was talking to the shooter man and he said shudderman there is a little sister she has no christ what about the day she's gonna be married if she's virgin we're gonna honor her if she's not virgin we need to make sure she got the token before she goes to her wedding she say this is what i am watch verse 10 i am a what in other words me i'm a virgin solomon you understand the song of solomon now i am a wall and my breasts look they are already developed my breast like tower then when i in his eyes as one then was i in his eyes as one that found water because he loves the virgins that's why i found favorite in other words that's why i find favor on you solomon because i kept my virginity everybody so far brother stephen that's why the prophet messenger of revelation 10 7 will be the same as malachi 456 he will be naturally like elijah and who and notice both prophesy much against what and the ways elijah cried out against him and john rebuke who the spirit of elijah comes five times the first time elijah rebuked jesus the second time elisha in second king chapter three and elijah said unto the king of israel what have had to do with thee get did to the prophet of your father and to the prophet of that he was the child of jezebel coming to seek a prophet and the prophet was again attacking that jezebel spirit again and elijah said as the lord host liveth before human stand surely we are not worried not that i regard the presence of who the righteous man then the king of judah the king of judah i would not look to or did not do what in other words if it was not for the presence of this righteous king you house of heb i would not the spirit of elijah attacked jezebel elisha attacks still jezebel john the baptist attacked jezebel in herodias the fourth elijah have to come because there is a jezebel in the church ages which is coming all the way to the laodicea churches still that same spirit because of immoral women anybody clear so far this is it here and then we head home gotta stop somewhere let me see okay all right adam is here adam is put to sleep when he's put to sleep somebody pop up look beautiful long hair they say that he was designed by the devil what does brother brother mean by design by the devil put your seat belt and we head straight on the eye altitude then i'll go to the airport anybody clear i can't touch the eye here you ready why did brother branham say what does brother branham means by desire by the devil we were taught that the woman was designed by the devil and we were taught that it means that the woman was created by the devil right let's listen to brother branham all right in the bible job says that that hand has made me and fashioned me together around the body who created you it's god who created eve it's god psalm 119 thy hand has made me and fashioned me give me understanding that i may learn that commandment psalm 139 da has possessed my reign that has covered me in my mother's womb i will praise thee for i am fearfully and wonderfully you remember that marvelous alda and that my soul knoweth right well my substance was not hid from thee when i was mad in secret and curiously wrought in the lower part of the earth the knights did see my substance yet being on perfect and in the book all my members were written we already went through this which in continuous were water when as yet there were none of them how precious also are they unto whom so the one who created man is god the one who created the woman is god not to the devil brother stephen brother branham said the devil designer hallelujah get your seatbelt pretty good notice why did she do such a thing how could that what and what and what if was beautiful it was perfect and it was the work of god not the devil hallelujah i seen a picture one time i believe he was in greece of an artist that painted a picture of eve she was the most horrible looking thing you ever seen that shows what a carnal mind can look in but she was not she was what because she was woman of water [Music] relax notice why do why did she do such a thing being in the water not only was she beautiful and perfect she was in the same level as men that's why brother branham said go home and study you bring it like this they will bring you scripture and they corner you and you don't know how you answer it was not brother branham arrow it's the people don't study she was right with men co-equal with him but we all know that she lost her co-equalness with men when she's seen and god say man will be your water we already explained this not for abused anybody clear so far brother branham eve was the white most beautiful woman that was ever on this she was what so you who taught unknown that brother branham says that women are created by satan you need to correct that okay from today sister remove that improper teaching and then the women are below in the message the women are below in the middle are you the one that taught that but branham didn't say that what does design mean are you there because the way we are teaching the way we thought it looks like when it's a male child god sleep when it's a female then the devil comes in your belly in your womb and say sister so-and-so you want to have a baby girl i need to work on her i'm an user the devil is not the one fashioning my baby it is not the devil it is god that fashion my child the woman designed by the devil like the devil by the devil why do you love her why do you love something that was designed by the devil why why you can't leave yourself why and matter of fact men shall leave his water and water and cling to who [Applause] not woman shall live man not woman man [Music] now the sister i awake are you there when he was the sister door to the devil yay are you there revenge are you there are you there now take that thought out of your mind she is born of your bone and flesh of your flesh not a work of devil my wife was not designed by satan you can believe it for your wife not mine i refuse that by the authority of the spoken word hallelujah are we okay hallelujah she was there because she was god perfect taught us a what i can see eve beautiful her blonde hair hanging down in her back her eyes as water and water can you give people these quotes and sparkly like the star why solomon the whole book of song of solomon is looking at a woman amen she didn't have to use any max factor to make her pretty sister what is the name of actual nowadays max factor again you gave it to me mary mary kay yeah she didn't have to use american to make her pretty no sir if i said max factor that was the time of brother branham so i need to make the word flesh are you there sin what did that but look brother she is mad in water god created man and female in his arm she is mad after the image of that's a second time in the flesh the first in the spirit are you there after god had created her how never to never to never to they sparkle to never go out of the water she was to be beautiful how how can satan created something eternal hallelujah with this creation when god created a woman god created her so perfectly and god loaded three things in here stay very we shall have time hallelujah when god created this beautiful masterpiece without satan without the advice of satan we made sister believe their body house made by satan hallelujah god loaded the eve with three things number one god loaded her with virginity number two god loaded her with womanhood number three god loaded her with motherhood through virtue loaded on her stay with me if i can finish just this part she has a sacred trust of virtue that has been given to her trusted to her by who it's god that trusted that this belongs to the woman anybody clear god gave her that virtue just as he was in a garden even she can say what or what she has a right to refuse and to say yes she has a sacred trust of water you saw it today committed to her that she must not work the woman who them speaking of here is her water womanhood virginity we all know motherhood we all know she must bear children this is the key here that's the devil uses now we're getting towards your heart here it is a water or a conduct or a water a character around water so there is something that a woman must have when men are around there is something that a girl had to have when abraham is around she could not behave like sarah hallelujah not letting water not at all you understand now not at all look on this screen and see this movie star doing water when the movie star are kissing women they are breaking womanhood because it's behavior it is not here yet it is not here yet that womanhood include kissing hallelujah and doing what we already talked to you in this church about hugging and water slopping around over these women a woman does that is a what bad character we already explained you this i'm gonna move down but the sex gland are in the lips and see all this nonsense of the hollywood today and all this slopping and loving around with women and so far in other words the kissing that you see the kids the kids the kids on the movie it is breaking womanhood because it's not the act yet clear laughing around women and so forth the little girl looking at that no wonder our morals are rotted and decay and filthy see because it's put before the water so when the children look at that even though your daughter is still virgin even though your daughter have not gotten pregnant yet but you are destroying your daughter womanhood these things need to be taught anybody care hallelujah no wonder that men act around women the way they do is because women act around water the way they want in other words the women are the one provoking the men she character herself out her with pair of water and water and man water on the street doing what all of that are in case in womanhood you follow me the tight dress the tight paint everything has nothing to do with virginity or motherhood it's all under womanhood womanhood is the first bait they'd ever use to destroy a man if you bypass this you go here we call that rape no matter what she say she might be as virtuous to her husband you follow me she's kept here clean because brother branham says if a woman is married virgin she can live with her husband god still see you no matter how much she's virgin to her husband virtues to her husband as she can be but in the sight of god she's what what made you adulterous is not the act yet it is not the womb yet you are made adulterous by womanhood you understand now that's why the scriptures say whoever looketh on there and do what that lust is caused by womanhood not these two this is secret this is secret it's the womb this is secret it's below but this one is public before we head into the high here you will see what high heel does hallelujah whoever whosoever looking upon a woman and lasted after her have committed adultery with her in his wife she what to be water women don't present this and this they are presenting this [Applause] the window of jezebel it was not this it was not this it was this hallelujah notice that is committed to her sacred virtue sacred womanhood and sacred water to honor her praise the lord that's why let me think let me skip this hallelujah you there there never was such a thing as a creation of sin follow me very good i'm heading to the airport i don't want to leave you hanging da didn't do down good did it sin is not a water no sir sin is a what there is only one creator that is who the devil did not create the woman if your definition of design is creating you making the devil a creator hallelujah this is a surgery sin is water righteousness water what is adultery righteousness what what is a lie truth what certainly what is a curse of war a curse word is god's blessing turn to a curse word instead of a blessing sin is water sin is water the devil does not have power to create but have a power to pervert you okay now are we dropping now hallelujah satan could not work he only did what what what so god have to create fast when god finish his work completed everything and say he look good then the devil comes not to create but to what the designing of the devil is not a creation [Music] hallelujah the designing of the devil is by perfection hallelujah satan his power he got power he's perverted water power of god it's not real power it is a perversion of god's power everything that's set in water so the woman was not created by satan everybody clear so far brother branham said she was designed what does he mean everything that satan has got is what something that was water i'm heading to the airport just let me finish this thought then the next time we catch up we'll be good sin itself is only righteousness profession now there is only and that is who satan is not her he is only a water of what [Music] design by perversion of the original creation everything is always a perfection of what is right satan can pervert but he cannot do you see what we made brother branham speak things he didn't even say see so we found that set and always takes a time and what is going to do off off of what god has water the right hand man of almighty god was who the son of the morning the first god granted him almost what co-worker with him he was a co-worker partly equal with him only he could not water god is the only water but satan took something that god and did what into something water ever clear hallelujah but in the human race it is the woman that is pretty not the man originally it's that way why was he done to deceive by her what is that design a creation now we clear now how did he design the woman and i'm going to stop here and we're going to pick it up her designer saturn is still water if satan is still working on the woman today so that means he step at the maternity when they bring a baby girl he begin to work on her satan is still working on her too in this last day the designer is by what are we okay now the designer by water she's a virgin he worked on her he's designing the woman by working on a finnish product now there is nothing can stoop like her she is designed so that she can be deceiving and satan is really doing what watch the word of brother brother never creating him working on her today in this last day because he is here who start to work on water on her who start to work on water is her adam of all let's stop there we need to understand brother branham way brother branham is asking adam or who question what kind of work did adam do on evil nothing right what kind of work did god do on evil he created eve but brother branham is saying between adam and satan who work on her is that work creation or something else who touch eve first that's the work brother branham is talking about amen not creation who work on her adam or satan god or satan see that is her what he is her chief water the top weapon you remember the beginning top weapon to throw man to her water that's why he used sarah that's why he used eve that's why he used jezebel that's why he used bathsheba that's why he used the strange women that's why he used all of those it's the chief weapon what is working what is designing brother branham saying i gotta stop here that the working is the designing and that designing is not a creation but uh how did how did eve design adam how did sarah design abraham are you okay now let me finish this you're giving me grace i gotta leave you here so we can pick up you giving me grace raise your hand amen thank you we okay

touches again and he changed and brother branham and the marriage and divorce say nowadays they took a snake and they've rolled the snake around the woman leg and they took the women in a sensation way beyond men that sensation must be way beyond men to remove the pain of destroying virginity are you following me before unite if you begin to feel funny she began to feel funny she began to feel funny she said satan serpent yeah it sounds good say yes so what else this is what you do this is what you do this is what you do this is what you do this is what you do this is what you do abraham and the woman begin to get into a course with satan and satan begin to discern the woman by the teaching you understand now he said if work if work he said a woman don't walk like that he said tell me serpent he said when you walk twist a little bit and if begin to twist he say put like you're going up like this like this yes like that go ahead go ahead go back the second time go back to the three times go back to the second time go back to the 10th that's the way you walk now now make sure you twist make sure you twist make sure you twist and he goes stretching say go ahead go ahead very good very good now you do this now you do this and the devil destroy womanhood and destroy virginity and also destroy and eve got pregnant all three verses to destroy in one shot you follow me the design of the devil is by teaching you're following me now the design of sarah to abraham and herger is by teaching the design of jezebel by teaching you follow me when he finished he slip up when adam came adam notice eve walking and twisting you follow me then something moved in adam adam saying what kind of work is that he said hey it's good adam that's my new work adam say you were not walking like this before now the beautiful creation of god is now perverted by discerning of teaching and she now taught adam you do this serpent showed me like this serpent showed me like this serpent showed me like this serpent showed me and the more adam get into it the veil of adam is beginning to come off a woman was created by god is a work of god he's a perfect work to be respected to be honored and to be cherished because eve had a voice sarah had a voice jezebel had a voice and also laodicea have a voice and also the final voice to the final edge also will be the bride of jesus christ lexington hallelujah i had to explain it without touching on the coat lord's willing we will touch on the coat now you see how was adam teaching him and what was the conversation between the serpent and eve you're going to see what brother branham said then you're going to understand but the key i want you to keep for next time the design that the devil design is he designed womanhood he changed the behavior the conduct the character of eve now when eve walk adam look he said what happened to you why are you walking like that who taught you that kind of walk it is the serpent so why are you twisting the terpene taught me how to twist that's why hollywood showed women in models hard work and women want to work like the women and the model that teaching is from satan to design you because you were not born like that and when you walk a certain way it's gonna cause lust [Music] let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you for your grace for your love for your mercy for giving us another opportunity to dig into these things lord as we have studied lord you brought the position of a man back in this church you brought the place of a woman and the respect that should be given to her and to the children without abuse from a man father now you are showing a door that our sister need to know to be protected because father to overcome is to recognize the devil by his tactics lord we all wear work that were created by you but the devil is still working on us working on the church and working in women specifically because your prophet told us that the condition of a woman is showing the condition of the church father may we realize what we are watching on tv what we are trying to copy what we are trying to portray what we are trying to do on our facebook unless we find ourselves committing adultery by breaking our womanhood now realizing that we the one that initiated the act alone father may we be attentive to nothing else lord but the original voice of the spoken word because anything that is contrary to that original word is a perversion father the voice of evil was perverted because he was contrary to the original word the voice of sarah was perverted because he was contrary to the original word the voice of jezebel and laodicea perverted because it's contrary to the original world the only voice that was correct was the one that was brought to gabriel through an angel when he gave mary the message that message was perfectly in line with the prophecy of the old testament and he had nothing to do with sex lord he was the holy spirit coming up with our sensation lord father may you touch may you bring again more revelation and unfold your eyes and give faith lord father to this church protect us as we commit everything unto the hand and the rest of the weak lord bless us lord in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you brother john thank you church god bless you we love you this is the evening time it's later than we think the bride is

hearing that voice telling us to come up a little higher lord as you call john up a little higher in the book of revelation you're calling a people up a little higher and father we just thank you for it lord be with us father as we travel back to our homes and father may these things just may we meditate on them throughout the day throughout the week may we just chew on these things father and and may you open up even greater things to us father the lord we just appreciate what you're doing and we thank you lord we commit this service lord restore brother stephen his strength father and lord we just want to say thank you for giving us a pastor that can dig into these things and bring these things out and lord not not glorifying the man but lord we give honor to him father because of what
