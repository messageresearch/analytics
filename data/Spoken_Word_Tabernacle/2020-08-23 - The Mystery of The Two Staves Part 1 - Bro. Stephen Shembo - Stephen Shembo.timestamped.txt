[20:21] Hallelujah
[20:24] Hallelujah
[20:26] praise the Lord
[20:32] now you know I don't I didn't have
[20:34] anybody text me the last time I looked
[20:36] at my phone for uh
[20:39] any praise reports
[20:41] sorry
[20:42] or any uh
[20:44] prayer requests
[20:46] so I'm going to ask if anybody has one
[20:48] they'd like to bring up either one
[20:50] before we uh pray once again before the
[20:53] Lord anybody got anything
[20:56] I will say this we had a fellowship
[20:59] Friday night
[21:00] primarily for the Youth for some of the
[21:03] youth who had questions you know and we
[21:05] just kind of broke the ice really more
[21:07] than anything
[21:08] um and it it opened the door for some of
[21:12] us to um
[21:13] to try to understand and how our youth
[21:16] are thinking
[21:17] and
[21:19] you know we'll use that as a
[21:22] as a a God to pray in order to be able
[21:27] to relate more to our youth this message
[21:31] is a it's a big thing and a lot of them
[21:34] you know I'll tell you a statement that
[21:36] my son made and I and I hadn't really
[21:38] thought about it but
[21:40] you know
[21:41] you you go to one church and you're like
[21:43] man you need to come here this is it
[21:45] and then something happens if you move
[21:47] and you really need to come with us over
[21:49] here this is this is man this is good
[21:52] stuff
[21:53] and then something happens and he's like
[21:57] you know they get they got to mind of
[21:59] their own so you have to
[22:00] be able to understand how they're
[22:03] thinking as well
[22:04] and I didn't know what to say to him
[22:07] because we feel like we're following
[22:09] leadership of God and he's closing doors
[22:11] and opening others and you have to
[22:13] understand that and how it's
[22:14] everything's Progressive and you take
[22:16] steps to go higher and so I felt like
[22:20] Friday night was a great opportunity we
[22:22] enjoyed ourselves immensely we had a
[22:24] good time next time I want to bring some
[22:26] singing into it
[22:28] you know but it was primarily just to
[22:30] kind of you know kind of break the ice a
[22:33] little bit and we did have you know we
[22:35] did have some people speak up and we
[22:36] enjoyed it and
[22:38] um y'all forgive me because I talked a
[22:40] lot
[22:41] but you know I mean some moms have been
[22:43] around a little while we try to we gain
[22:45] an understanding of how things
[22:47] you know and we all want our kids to
[22:49] learn by our mistakes and a lot of times
[22:50] that just doesn't happen
[22:52] and I don't know if it's hard heads or
[22:56] soft behinds or what it is you know but
[22:58] uh
[23:00] so
[23:02] being such a big message we don't want
[23:04] to just
[23:05] go into it and leave our youth behind
[23:07] with questions especially so pray about
[23:10] it as a congregation that you know that
[23:12] we I mean they're here so they're
[23:15] hearing this and they're online and
[23:17] they're hearing this and and they may
[23:19] have a question brother Stephen has
[23:21] reiterated he did again Friday night
[23:22] open door open door open door
[23:26] ask a question
[23:27] if you have one don't be afraid you're
[23:30] going to be judged by asking the
[23:31] question because that's out of the
[23:33] picture
[23:34] our goal and I'm I know brother
[23:36] Stephen's heart he expressed it very um
[23:39] you know very specific Friday night that
[23:43] is to get our souls to God
[23:46] amen
[23:47] so does anybody have anything else they
[23:49] want to bring up or a prayer request
[23:52] anything uh
[23:55] I feel like I had one
[23:58] I don't recall
[24:00] yes ma'am
[24:06] yes a building yes
[24:10] um he'll he'll open the door when it's
[24:11] time
[24:14] I mean we're we're enjoying ourselves
[24:16] here but this is not
[24:18] it's not a sanctuary
[24:20] we don't know what went on in here last
[24:22] night or the day before so yes ma'am

[25:16] Witnesses something like that on his job

[32:57] first seat during the song service and
[33:00] then somebody comes up with a special
[33:02] and and back then it was spoken about

[33:44] just thinking about you know the
[33:46] characters and the scriptures how you
[33:48] know they live their lives and then
[33:50] there came a time when they realized the
[33:53] purpose for their lives
[33:54] then they're focused all the energy on
[33:56] that purpose
[33:58] and that's when they came into their
[33:59] Ministry and the prophet spoke about
[34:01] when the bride gets to know who she is
[34:04] and understanding the purpose for our
[34:06] lives and what we were born for
[34:08] it helps us to focus and put all the
[34:11] preeminence to that purpose amen

[43:37] you say brother Stephen but what about
[43:39] if somebody
[43:41] just is lagging beyond Behind or
[43:43] something like that uh
[43:45] when Moses went to pharaoh
[43:48] Pharaoh gave him an opportunity he said
[43:51] you can go and leave this behind Moses
[43:54] say not even a hoof
[43:57] a hoof is not even a human being
[44:00] are you there it's like the shoe of a
[44:03] beast but Moses didn't want to live even
[44:06] a hoof if Moses care about the hoof
[44:10] of a beast how much more a human being
[44:14] that have the spirit and the Soul living
[44:18] into them so we're not going to leave
[44:20] nobody
[44:22] nobody behind everybody on
[44:26] praise the Lord
[44:28] let's go to Exodus chapter 25.
[44:34] I will ask you to remain alert
[44:38] and stay put because of what we're going
[44:42] to get into
[44:44] right
[44:49] like I told someone I say it's like a
[44:51] new marriage
[44:53] you got to get used together after a
[44:56] while
[44:57] it's gonna be your common natural food
[45:01] at the beginning it's like where is he
[45:03] going
[45:04] amen
[45:06] we are going in the message
[45:10] Exodus 25 verse 8.
[45:15] and let them make me a sanctuary
[45:19] that I may dwell among them God wanted
[45:23] Israel to make him a house a sanctuary
[45:26] where God is going to dwell in the midst
[45:28] of his people
[45:30] according to all that I show you
[45:33] after the pattern of the Tabernacle and
[45:37] the pattern of all the instruments in
[45:40] other words Furniture thereof even so
[45:43] shall you make it you might be seated in
[45:46] other words God is talking to Israel
[45:49] here
[45:50] and God told Israel to make him a house
[45:54] but that house or that Tabernacle is not
[45:58] built any kind of way
[46:01] he had to be built according to a
[46:04] certain pattern
[46:06] so God gave Moses a pattern into the on
[46:09] the mountain he showed him what a
[46:12] tabernacle looked like and Moses have to
[46:15] reproduce or bring a replica of what he
[46:19] saw in heaven down in the Earth so you
[46:23] don't build God's house any kind of way
[46:26] you don't build God house by your
[46:29] intellect you don't build God's house by
[46:33] your preferences you don't build God's
[46:37] house by your feelings you build God's
[46:41] house according to the pattern and the
[46:44] pattern is the word of God
[46:46] everybody clear
[46:48] verse 10 and they shall make an ark so
[46:53] we're going to deal with the Ark of the
[46:55] Covenant they're going to make an arc of
[46:58] shitty mood acacia wood
[47:02] two cubits and a half shall be the left
[47:05] thereof and a cubit and a half the
[47:07] breadth thereof and a cubit and a half
[47:10] the height thereof in other words it's
[47:12] like a box
[47:14] everybody clear
[47:15] when you have a height and the breath
[47:18] and the length it's talking about the
[47:20] Box
[47:21] and you shall overlay it with pure gold
[47:24] it's made out of wood but that wood will
[47:29] be overlane by gold we know gold speaks
[47:32] about deity so there is a human being
[47:35] that's going to be there with the deity
[47:39] everybody clear
[47:41] and you shall overlay it with pure gold
[47:43] is sad and outside so deity is not going
[47:48] to be on the outside
[47:50] the word won't be only reflected outside
[47:54] in other words you don't only you are
[47:57] not holy only on the outside where you
[48:00] wear long dresses you don't put makeup
[48:03] that's good that's how sad DET have to
[48:06] be applied outside but deity also need
[48:10] to be applied inside and matter of fact
[48:13] you first start inside then it's gonna
[48:16] go outside so you must be overlay with
[48:20] God inside and outside if you are only
[48:24] of the lay outside you are living like a
[48:27] Pharisee You're Gonna Be Good to the
[48:30] eyes of the people but inside you are
[48:33] full of dead men's born you want to make
[48:36] sure you're inside and your outside is
[48:39] Overland by the character of God
[48:43] Hallelujah
[48:45] praise the Lord verse 11 and you shall
[48:49] overlay it with pure gold inside and
[48:51] outside shall you overlay it and shall
[48:55] make upon it a crown of gold round about
[48:59] and you shall cast four wings of gold so
[49:03] when you look at the ark it looks like a
[49:06] box
[49:07] but God told Israel or Moses he say
[49:11] after you finish the ark I want you to
[49:14] put four wings
[49:18] everybody clear
[49:20] four rings of Gold Everything Gold
[49:24] for it and put them in the four corners
[49:27] that's why I put it in the four corners
[49:30] in the four corners thereof and two
[49:33] Wings shall be in the one side of it and
[49:37] two ring in the other side of it in
[49:39] other words you have two rings here and
[49:41] you have two ring over there this is a
[49:44] box
[49:46] you are looking from the top
[49:49] and you shall make staves of shady mode
[49:54] God taught Israel that when you finish
[49:57] making the ark you're gonna put you're
[50:00] gonna make two steps and those days are
[50:03] like stuff or they are Road
[50:06] everybody following me you make two
[50:09] Stave
[50:12] but if you notice the stairs are made of
[50:16] City mode
[50:18] and the Ark of the Covenant was made of
[50:21] City mode
[50:23] in other words The Stave and the Ark
[50:27] were made of the same material
[50:31] are we clear
[50:32] praise the Lord
[50:34] and overlay them with gold
[50:38] so the composition of the Ark of the
[50:41] Covenant is exactly the composition of
[50:46] The Stave these states are on the same
[50:50] material same way stem pattern as the
[50:54] Ark of the Covenant
[50:55] everybody there
[50:57] verse 14.
[50:59] and you shall put the staff into the
[51:02] ring that's why I put The Stave there so
[51:05] this ring where for direction to put The
[51:09] Stave
[51:10] what for
[51:12] into the ring by the side of the ark
[51:16] that the ark may be born with them so to
[51:22] carry the Ark of the Covenant you need
[51:24] two staves
[51:26] and those two Stave must be of the same
[51:30] material just like the ark
[51:33] are we clear
[51:35] and the purpose was to Bear The Ark in
[51:39] other words you don't handle the ark
[51:41] right here
[51:43] you don't touch the ark
[51:46] you only handed the Ark by the stairs
[51:50] everybody clear if you want to move the
[51:53] Ark of the Covenant you don't push it
[51:55] like this
[51:56] if you touch it like uziah you're gonna
[51:59] find yourself dead
[52:01] when you wanna open when you wanna
[52:03] maneuver the Ark of the Covenant you are
[52:07] maneuver it by the staff
[52:10] it's like a woman that is cooking you
[52:13] don't put your hand into the fire inside
[52:16] the part where there is oil boiling but
[52:20] you use the spoon and with the spoon you
[52:23] are maneuvering the piece of steak that
[52:26] is in it are you there so if you want to
[52:29] move the Ark of the Covenant you handle
[52:32] the Ark of the Covenant by The Stave
[52:38] Allelujah
[52:39] verse 15 they still shall be in the
[52:44] rings of the Ark they shall not be taken
[52:50] from it
[52:52] in other words once they put the stairs
[52:56] in the earth it is forever
[52:59] are you there the ark and the staff
[53:03] become one piece
[53:05] you can never separate the Earth from
[53:09] the safe
[53:10] are you there if you are seeing The
[53:13] Stave you automatically know that the
[53:17] ark is there
[53:18] are you there even though you don't see
[53:21] the Ark of the Covenant but when you see
[53:24] The Stave
[53:25] automatically you know that the ark is
[53:28] connected with the staff because the
[53:32] staff were to never be separated with
[53:36] the Ark of the Covenant are you there
[53:39] but to move the oak you have to handle
[53:42] the Ark by The Stave
[53:45] everybody clear
[53:46] I'm going to skip some of them because
[53:48] of time let's go to Ezekiel chapter one
[53:54] praise the Lord
[53:59] but what I skipped was on top of the
[54:01] archery
[54:03] they made the matches it
[54:05] and they put it on top of the Ark you
[54:07] can read this at home
[54:09] and on top of that Ark Moses made two
[54:12] Caribbean
[54:14] of God and put him there
[54:19] the caribbeams were not made of City
[54:23] mode
[54:24] they were only made of gold and we
[54:28] preached to you before that would
[54:30] represent to what
[54:32] Humanity represent people but when they
[54:36] were making when they were making the
[54:39] Caribbeans they never made them with
[54:42] order
[54:44] are you there they were purely a
[54:47] different level of business
[54:51] of being
[54:52] are you there they work with human
[54:56] but they are not human
[55:01] let's go to Ezekiel chapter one
[55:04] I told you to stay up
[55:06] verse 3.
[55:09] the word of the Lord came expressly to
[55:11] Ezekiel the priest
[55:15] the son of boozy
[55:17] in the land of the Calvin's but the
[55:20] river keyboard
[55:21] and the Hand of the Lord was there upon
[55:24] him
[55:25] and I look and behold a what
[55:29] if not I want I'm gonna lose brother
[55:31] Kalima
[55:32] [Laughter]
[55:35] so the first thing
[55:40] a whirlwind
[55:44] some people call that sometimes devils
[55:48] a whirlwind
[55:52] you know Lucifer wanted to build a city
[55:54] on and off and the Jerusalem was also on
[55:57] the North
[55:58] so from there came a whirlwind
[56:02] are you there it was a great cloud
[56:06] and a fire
[56:08] unfolding itself in other words the fire
[56:11] was flashing
[56:13] first it looks like a cloud but this
[56:16] Cloud have Fire and Fire are flashing
[56:19] Ezekiel is watching this
[56:23] and a brightness was abandoned because
[56:25] there is fire you have a brightness
[56:27] around it
[56:28] and out of the midst thereof as the
[56:32] color of amber out of the midst of the
[56:36] fire so first you have a whirlwind then
[56:40] in the midst of that world when there is
[56:42] fire coming out and in the midst of the
[56:45] fire right in the middle of it there was
[56:48] a color of amber
[56:50] if you read a message long enough you
[56:52] know what it means
[56:54] the color of Amber is the color of the
[56:57] pillar of fire are you there it was
[57:01] right in the midst of it praise the Lord
[57:04] verse 5 and also also out of the midst
[57:08] thereof came the likeness of what
[57:11] for living creature we found out that
[57:15] when they made the Ark of the Covenant
[57:18] Moses put the Caribbean which are the
[57:21] living creature because Moses was
[57:24] reproducing what he saw in heaven
[57:27] now Ezekiel is now reproducing he's just
[57:31] giving a description of what he's saying
[57:35] of a vision but in that description the
[57:38] first thing he saw was what a color of
[57:42] amber remember John in the Book of
[57:44] Revelation when he went up and the door
[57:48] was open the first thing John saw was a
[57:51] man here sitting on the throne
[57:55] remember
[57:56] and then after that he began to see the
[57:59] forbest Ezekiel first saw the color of
[58:03] amber which is the pillar of fire and
[58:06] after that then came out what four
[58:09] living creatures
[58:12] I'm doing this to help you
[58:14] four living creatures and these was
[58:18] their appearance they had the likeness
[58:20] of her men they are not human but when
[58:24] you look at them they look like men
[58:26] in other words there is a connection
[58:28] between them and human but they are
[58:31] separate beings
[58:32] everybody there
[58:34] and everyone had four faces and everyone
[58:37] had four wings and their feet were
[58:40] straight fit because they look like men
[58:43] and the soul of their feet was like the
[58:46] soul of a calf foot oops that's why they
[58:49] are not human the living beings are you
[58:52] there
[58:53] and the sparkling like the color of
[58:57] burnished brass everybody there
[59:00] and they have
[59:02] the hands of a man under the wings of
[59:06] their four side in other words they have
[59:09] part human part animal mixed together
[59:12] everybody clear
[59:14] and they had four and they forehead
[59:17] their faces and their wings I'm gonna go
[59:20] verse nine their wings were John one to
[59:23] another
[59:24] they turned not when they went
[59:26] they went everyone straight forward
[59:29] remember when I spoke about uh Jericho
[59:33] when uh uh Joshua was telling Israel
[59:38] Joshua said when you attack you go
[59:41] straight you don't deviate right and
[59:44] left and these four beasts when they are
[59:47] moving they always move straight
[59:50] they never deviate to the left or to the
[59:54] right they always move straight I want
[59:57] you to keep that
[1:00:00] praise the Lord verse 10 I ask for the
[1:00:04] likeness of their faces they had they
[1:00:07] fall heard the face of a man you know
[1:00:11] what it means
[1:00:12] and the face of a lion you know what he
[1:00:15] means you already seen this so much
[1:00:18] on the right side
[1:00:22] Ezekiel is saying
[1:00:24] on the right side there is a lion
[1:00:28] remember how Israel was camping
[1:00:30] right remember
[1:00:33] on a lion
[1:00:34] and the four and day four had the face
[1:00:38] of phenox under
[1:00:40] on the left side remember how Israel was
[1:00:43] camping the ox was here
[1:00:45] and the lion was there and on the top
[1:00:48] was what an ego done and on the south
[1:00:51] was what man remember the clock right
[1:00:55] everybody clear
[1:00:57] all day four also had the face of El
[1:01:00] Amigo let's jump to verse uh 12.
[1:01:05] and they went everyone what
[1:01:07] straightforward
[1:01:10] but where are we they're going what are
[1:01:13] they following
[1:01:15] where the spirit was to go so the
[1:01:20] movement of the Caribbeans doesn't come
[1:01:23] from themselves
[1:01:25] are we there there's movement of the
[1:01:29] Caribbean comes from the direction of
[1:01:33] the spirit of God
[1:01:35] so when the pillar of fire moves to the
[1:01:38] right
[1:01:39] automatically the carry beams are moving
[1:01:42] to the right when the pillar of fire
[1:01:45] stop the Caribbean stop that's why
[1:01:48] Israel on their Journey when the pillar
[1:01:51] of fire stopped the stop when the pillar
[1:01:54] of fire rolls and begin to move they
[1:01:56] were moving because the tribes of Israel
[1:01:59] were under the anointing of the
[1:02:03] Caribbeans
[1:02:05] are we following
[1:02:09] they went
[1:02:11] verse 12 where the spirit was God was to
[1:02:15] go they went and they turned not when
[1:02:18] they went so no turning straight
[1:02:22] if it's left left straight right right
[1:02:25] straight whichever direction
[1:02:29] verse 13 as for the likeness of the
[1:02:32] living creature their appearance was
[1:02:35] like burning cause of fire they also
[1:02:39] look like fire
[1:02:40] I know this is Uncharted Territory
[1:02:43] but in this church
[1:02:45] from Genesis to revelation
[1:02:49] he went up and down among the living
[1:02:51] creature and the fire was bright and out
[1:02:55] of the fire went forth lightning brother
[1:02:58] Branham said that word means light in
[1:03:01] other words out of their Fire Light came
[1:03:03] out and we already know that light who
[1:03:06] had the color of what amber everybody
[1:03:08] clear
[1:03:10] now this is very important now first
[1:03:13] 14 and the living creature run and
[1:03:16] return as the appearance of a flash of
[1:03:20] lightning
[1:03:22] verse 15. now I beheld the living
[1:03:26] creature behold one what
[1:03:29] so these living creatures were full
[1:03:32] are you there one two three four they
[1:03:36] were moving as the spirit of the Lord
[1:03:38] moved
[1:03:40] so the anointing upon the Caribbeans
[1:03:43] were coming from the pillar of Fire
[1:03:46] but when they move they were moving with
[1:03:50] Will
[1:03:51] every single beasts have a will
[1:03:56] praise the Lord
[1:03:58] upon the Earth by the living creature
[1:04:01] with its four faces if you notice those
[1:04:04] will were connected to the Earth in
[1:04:07] other words the ark is moving but the
[1:04:10] ark is moving with the four living would
[1:04:13] be and every Beast has a will
[1:04:17] like a chariot
[1:04:20] right okay
[1:04:22] verse 16 the appearance of the wheels
[1:04:26] and their work was like the color of
[1:04:29] burial
[1:04:30] and day four had one likeness everyone
[1:04:33] have a will
[1:04:35] and the air appearance and their work
[1:04:38] was as they were a will in the middle of
[1:04:42] our
[1:04:43] we heard this so much today you're gonna
[1:04:46] see what it means are you there so we
[1:04:49] heard the wheel right here
[1:04:51] they were had Spokes and everything and
[1:04:55] the Caribbeans were right there
[1:04:57] riding with the wheel but when Ezekiel
[1:05:01] looked he saw that in the middle of the
[1:05:05] will there was another wheel
[1:05:10] all right
[1:05:12] verse 17 when they went they went upon
[1:05:17] their facade and they turned not when
[1:05:19] they went we already understand them
[1:05:22] Verse 18 ask for their ring the wings of
[1:05:26] the will
[1:05:28] are you there
[1:05:29] ask for their wings they were so high
[1:05:32] that they were Dreadful
[1:05:34] and their wings were full of what
[1:05:38] so the will of the Caribbeans has a ram
[1:05:44] and inside the ram they were eyes
[1:05:51] what kind of will is this
[1:05:53] huh
[1:05:55] if you go in the Book of Revelation
[1:05:57] chapter 4 the four Beast themselves Have
[1:06:02] Eyes on them you know that right so we
[1:06:06] don't have to go there
[1:06:07] and the wheels of the forbids also
[1:06:11] contain ice
[1:06:16] praise the Lord round about them
[1:06:19] the verse okay 19 and when the living
[1:06:23] creature went the will went by them in
[1:06:27] other words they will were following the
[1:06:30] Beast and the beasts were following the
[1:06:33] pillar of Fire
[1:06:35] you remember you understand
[1:06:37] that's why Paul said follow me as I
[1:06:40] follow Christ so when Paul moved to the
[1:06:43] right it is not power moving it is the
[1:06:46] pillar of fire moving and the church
[1:06:48] also has to move in the direction of the
[1:06:52] messenger
[1:06:54] because the anointing we're anointing
[1:06:56] the age
[1:06:58] everybody clear
[1:06:59] all right and when they live in creature
[1:07:02] will lift up from the earth the wheel
[1:07:04] will lift up so whatever happened to The
[1:07:06] Living wind they will are connected to
[1:07:09] them
[1:07:10] praise the Lord
[1:07:12] verse 20.
[1:07:15] yeah I'm gonna stop here then move to
[1:07:17] the other one wherever the spirit was to
[1:07:20] go
[1:07:21] they went who is they
[1:07:25] the wheels
[1:07:28] there was their Spirit to go
[1:07:32] and the will were lift up opposite them
[1:07:35] for their Spirit everybody is following
[1:07:39] me
[1:07:39] for the spirit of the living creature
[1:07:43] was in the
[1:07:45] are you following me the pillar of Fire
[1:07:49] that Spirit was in the Caribbeans and
[1:07:54] the spirit that was in the Caribbeans
[1:07:55] was in the will in other words the
[1:07:59] Caribbeans and the will were all under
[1:08:03] the anointing of God
[1:08:07] let's go to Ezekiel 10 then we're gonna
[1:08:10] pray
[1:08:13] Ezekiel 10 verse 1.
[1:08:19] I sleep a lot you can read Ezekiel one
[1:08:22] all the way at home and you're gonna see
[1:08:25] there is a throne
[1:08:26] on top of it because the mercy seat was
[1:08:29] the Throne of God and God was meeting
[1:08:31] Israel in between the Caribbeans right
[1:08:34] there
[1:08:35] everybody clear
[1:08:36] then I look and behold in the firmament
[1:08:40] that was above the head of what
[1:08:43] so those cherubims as they are moving
[1:08:47] with their will one here one day one day
[1:08:51] one day like a chariot on top of them
[1:08:55] they had a filament like a heaven
[1:08:58] in other words they were carrying
[1:09:00] something
[1:09:03] okay
[1:09:05] the cherubim there appear over them as
[1:09:10] it were a sapphire stone
[1:09:12] as the appearance of the likeness of
[1:09:15] Earth
[1:09:16] so on top of the carry beams were what a
[1:09:20] throne and when Moses made the Ark of
[1:09:23] the Covenant he put the Caribbeans and
[1:09:26] right there they were what the throne
[1:09:31] but the Ark of Moses didn't have wheels
[1:09:40] praise the Lord verse two and he spoke
[1:09:43] to the man clothed with linen and said
[1:09:46] go in between the wheels
[1:09:48] even under the Caribbeans the wheels
[1:09:51] were under and fill your hand with cause
[1:09:54] of fire that was the appearance of the
[1:09:56] Caribbeans from between the cherubims
[1:09:59] and Scattered them over the city
[1:10:01] judgment
[1:10:02] and he went in in my side now the
[1:10:05] Caribbean stood
[1:10:07] on the right side of the house when the
[1:10:10] men went in and the clouds filled the
[1:10:13] inner Court then the glory of the Lord
[1:10:15] went up from the
[1:10:18] have you seen that so the glory of the
[1:10:21] Lord was sinning when the Caribbean was
[1:10:25] that's why when Moses made the ark the
[1:10:29] glory of the Lord was moving and sitting
[1:10:31] where riding between the Caribbeans
[1:10:34] and when the glory is lift up
[1:10:38] something happened
[1:10:40] and stood over the threshold of the
[1:10:43] house and the house was filled with the
[1:10:45] cloud and the court was full of the
[1:10:48] brightness of the Lord's Glory and the
[1:10:51] sound of the cherubim's Wings Was Heard
[1:10:54] even to the other court as the voice of
[1:10:57] who
[1:10:59] when he
[1:11:00] you see the anointing on the Caribbeans
[1:11:03] it was God all along Gods who fills
[1:11:07] everything all space-time and Eternity
[1:11:10] and he came to pass that when the head
[1:11:12] commanded the man clove with the line
[1:11:14] and saying take fire from between the
[1:11:17] quails from between the cherubims then
[1:11:20] he went in and Stood Beside the whales
[1:11:23] and one caribou stretch forth his hand
[1:11:27] you remember that one right
[1:11:29] the one who always give judgment
[1:11:31] you remember him last week
[1:11:33] right
[1:11:34] he was the lion
[1:11:36] when it comes to judgment it's the lion
[1:11:38] who reached forth and say take it
[1:11:40] and one carried stretch forth his hand
[1:11:43] between the cherubims
[1:11:46] to the fire that was between the
[1:11:48] cherubims and took thereof and put it
[1:11:51] into the hands of him the city
[1:11:53] everything cleared so far
[1:11:56] so we have the Ark of the Covenant
[1:11:58] forings with two steps to carry the ark
[1:12:02] the staff and the Ark made of the same
[1:12:05] material and the staff had to be never
[1:12:09] separated from the ark you cannot make a
[1:12:13] difference between the staff and the Ark
[1:12:16] you can never make The Stave deviate
[1:12:20] from the ark the staff is always
[1:12:25] connected to the Earth
[1:12:28] we get
[1:12:29] and then we found a whirlwind right here
[1:12:32] out of this Whirlwind came for living
[1:12:35] creature all of them were carrying
[1:12:37] another Throne another Ark and they have
[1:12:41] wheels with them and those whales have
[1:12:44] eyes and the Caribbean were following
[1:12:47] the pillar of fire and the whales were
[1:12:49] following the Caribbeans because the
[1:12:52] spirit of the pillar of fire was in the
[1:12:55] Caribbeans and the spirit of the
[1:12:56] Caribbeans was in the wheels everybody
[1:13:00] clear now now let's pray
[1:13:02] Heavenly Father
[1:13:04] Lord we thank you again for your grace
[1:13:06] your love your mercy and for everything
[1:13:09] you're doing for us father thank you for

[1:14:11] unto their hand sealing the devil away
[1:14:14] from this place in the name of Jesus
[1:14:16] Christ amen
[1:14:18] praise the Lord where are you going
[1:14:21] brother Stephen
[1:14:23] praise the Lord can everybody say this
[1:14:26] you mind me okay that's okay brother
[1:14:28] Elijah can we move this puppy there so I
[1:14:31] can read it correctly praise the name of
[1:14:34] the Lord
[1:14:36] all right now brother Brian I'm saying
[1:14:38] here thank you my brother
[1:14:40] you are wanting to serve God he was
[1:14:43] talking to a lady
[1:14:45] under the discernment
[1:14:47] and brother Brandon Begin to discern
[1:14:49] that woman and he says that you are
[1:14:51] wanting to serve God
[1:14:53] in a different category
[1:14:56] so God can be served in category
[1:15:01] [Laughter]
[1:15:03] you might be in category one for a long
[1:15:05] term then God might have to shut you up
[1:15:09] because he's trying to bring you to
[1:15:12] another level are you there
[1:15:15] praise the Lord you are wanting to serve
[1:15:18] God in a different category than what
[1:15:21] you serve him into so this woman was
[1:15:25] serving God but this woman has a burning
[1:15:29] desire in her heart to move into the
[1:15:32] higher realm with God and brother
[1:15:35] Branham discerned that and he said that
[1:15:37] you are serving God all along you are
[1:15:40] serving God In Living Word Tabernacle
[1:15:42] but God chose you because he wants you
[1:15:46] to serve him in a different category
[1:15:53] you have promised God if you could get
[1:15:56] well that you will go on and sink deeper
[1:16:01] things of God are you there
[1:16:05] we had milk we had skin milk we were
[1:16:11] growing like children now it's the time
[1:16:14] of maturity
[1:16:16] are you there we need to think like a
[1:16:19] dog in Christ
[1:16:21] are you there
[1:16:22] brother Brian I'm in perfect Faith he
[1:16:24] says I want you to get this now
[1:16:27] the church has got to lift itself in the
[1:16:32] power of God
[1:16:34] how I love brother Branham we are too
[1:16:38] close to the end
[1:16:40] coronaviruses bringing this word into a
[1:16:43] chaos
[1:16:44] we don't even know what's going to
[1:16:46] happen we are very close to the end
[1:16:49] we've been in the message for so long
[1:16:55] we are too close to the end now and I
[1:16:58] believe the church is in condition
[1:17:02] where we can teach it a little deeper
[1:17:06] faith
[1:17:08] are you there
[1:17:10] and Rob some of this make-believer out
[1:17:16] and get into something real it's got to
[1:17:20] be something that you know
[1:17:23] enough following the message not knowing
[1:17:27] what you're doing in the message
[1:17:29] are you there enough of that
[1:17:32] this is the time to get into the world
[1:17:36] so that God's looseness can be chopped
[1:17:39] away they make beliefs can be chopped
[1:17:42] away we don't have to argue again whose
[1:17:45] father pranam what is what is what when
[1:17:49] I'm talking when is God talking we have
[1:17:52] to chip those stuff away so you can
[1:17:55] serve God in a different category
[1:18:00] pretty good
[1:18:03] The Mystery of the two steps
[1:18:07] part one
[1:18:10] when we describe the Ark of the Covenant
[1:18:13] there is two steps to the Ark of the
[1:18:16] Covenant
[1:18:17] and we want to know what's wrong with
[1:18:20] those two states
[1:18:22] they say mystery
[1:18:24] brother Stephen brother Branham already
[1:18:26] preached Mysteries
[1:18:28] when I say mystery in this church I am
[1:18:31] not preaching a new mystery
[1:18:34] are you there I am only repeating the
[1:18:38] Mysteries that were already been
[1:18:40] revealed by the seventh angel which is
[1:18:44] brother Branham where the sanding of the
[1:18:47] seven angels all the Mysteries the
[1:18:52] message is Mysteries
[1:18:54] foreign
[1:19:00] the Mysteries here is the mystery
[1:19:03] a mystery is a scripture
[1:19:06] so a scripture is a mystery
[1:19:10] is a preciously previously hidden truth
[1:19:15] now divinely reveal
[1:19:18] but which is a supernatural element
[1:19:22] still remain despite the Revelation are
[1:19:27] you there
[1:19:28] so when God unfold the mystery he always
[1:19:33] locked the supernatural element
[1:19:36] are you there because if the
[1:19:39] supernatural element is not locked even
[1:19:42] the devil can get access to the things
[1:19:45] of God but the things of God are only
[1:19:49] for the elect only the elect can catch
[1:19:52] the mind of God are you there so if you
[1:19:56] say God revealed the seals if you give
[1:19:59] somebody the book of the seal everybody
[1:20:02] can read the book of the seal but even
[1:20:05] though you are reading the book of the
[1:20:07] seal there is still a supernatural
[1:20:11] element despite the
[1:20:13] Revelation are you there
[1:20:17] amen praise the Lord
[1:20:20] as we're getting there
[1:20:22] brother Branham
[1:20:25] why you are one Mysteries all the time
[1:20:28] Christ is what
[1:20:33] the mystery of God revealed
[1:20:38] the Bible is written in Mysteries
[1:20:44] are you there
[1:20:46] the whole Bible here is written in
[1:20:50] Mysteries
[1:20:54] Jesus thanked the father for it see that
[1:20:58] he was wrought in Mysteries
[1:21:01] the statue of a perfect man but when you
[1:21:04] can see that the scripture is not
[1:21:07] contradictory that you can say that and
[1:21:10] can see that by the revelation of God
[1:21:14] the whole word is wrought in
[1:21:18] and only the knowledge of God can reveal
[1:21:22] it
[1:21:23] because there is still a supernatural
[1:21:27] element despite the revelation
[1:21:33] praise the Lord then when you get and
[1:21:37] say punctuate every word of God with an
[1:21:40] amen then add to that add that to your
[1:21:43] faith
[1:21:44] in the exposition of the seven Church
[1:21:46] ages brother Branham say but
[1:21:49] a mystery
[1:21:51] requires the teaching of the spirit or
[1:21:57] it never becomes clear that's why we
[1:22:01] have the trouble in the message that we
[1:22:05] have today
[1:22:06] people handle Mysteries people spoke
[1:22:10] about Mysteries but they never took time
[1:22:14] to teach the Mysteries because the
[1:22:17] mystery requires a teaching of the
[1:22:20] spirit or it will never becomes clear
[1:22:27] how we need to hear from God and lay
[1:22:31] ourselves open and become yielded to the
[1:22:34] spirit heal and to know now when we look
[1:22:39] at the Ark of the Covenant
[1:22:42] the Oak right here is coupled by with
[1:22:46] The Mercy Seat
[1:22:48] the top part there is The Mercy Seat
[1:22:51] and the bottom one is the ark itself
[1:22:54] which is a box are you there a box of
[1:22:58] shitty mood or a cassia wood overlay
[1:23:01] with gold
[1:23:03] Now The Mercy Seat was the very Throne
[1:23:06] of God
[1:23:08] and The Mercy Seat have to name
[1:23:11] depending on the presence or the absence
[1:23:15] of the blood
[1:23:17] when the blood is upon the mercy said it
[1:23:21] was called the throne of grace
[1:23:24] and because Jesus Christ died he rose
[1:23:28] again and the lamb went and sat on the
[1:23:31] throne we have access to God to God and
[1:23:35] bring our petition and bring our problem
[1:23:38] and bring our trouble because as long as
[1:23:42] the blood is still on the throne God
[1:23:44] said approach him boldly with Assurance
[1:23:48] knowing that our prayer Our supplication
[1:23:51] will be answered by God
[1:23:54] are you there but once the blood is
[1:23:57] taken off
[1:23:59] then that Throne turned into a throne of
[1:24:02] judgment are you there depending whether
[1:24:05] the blood is there or not now we are
[1:24:09] dealing with the ark what is a knock
[1:24:14] praise the Lord
[1:24:16] what is an ark
[1:24:18] now the word Ark is a leader chest
[1:24:26] Kama or a place of Escape
[1:24:31] second come on a hiding place
[1:24:35] three definition
[1:24:37] there is three of them sparking the Old
[1:24:41] Testament
[1:24:43] the first one is a leader chest
[1:24:50] the leader chest spoke about the oak of
[1:24:54] the Covenant
[1:24:56] which was made by Moses
[1:24:59] the second definition brother Branham
[1:25:03] said it means a place of Escape
[1:25:07] a place of Escape
[1:25:12] spoke about the Ark of Noah
[1:25:17] are you there because the people that
[1:25:21] enter into the Ark of Noah escaped the
[1:25:24] judgment
[1:25:25] are we clear
[1:25:27] number three a hiding place
[1:25:34] spoke of the Ark
[1:25:37] of Moses
[1:25:39] where they put Moses as a baby
[1:25:43] are you there but brother Branham said
[1:25:45] there is three Ark first there is a
[1:25:48] little chest which is the Ark of the
[1:25:51] Covenant
[1:25:52] there is a place of Escape which spoke
[1:25:55] about the Ark of Noah and then there is
[1:25:58] a hiding place where they hide Moses and
[1:26:01] they put him into a little basket that
[1:26:04] basket was the oak
[1:26:07] everybody clear
[1:26:09] so Enoch can be a little chest out of
[1:26:12] the Covenant a place of Escape Ark of
[1:26:15] Noah Hiding Place Ark of Moses which
[1:26:19] they call the basket there is three of
[1:26:22] them spoke in the Old Testament those
[1:26:24] are the three and we want to look at
[1:26:26] those three now for a few moments all
[1:26:30] those three were tapping one great Arc
[1:26:35] which is who
[1:26:37] everybody clear
[1:26:38] so they all come Noah spoke about Christ
[1:26:42] they all cause Moses talk about Christ
[1:26:45] they all called The Covenant spoke about
[1:26:48] Christ
[1:26:50] to the church today through is a
[1:26:54] confirmation all the old things just
[1:26:58] foreshadowing something are you there so
[1:27:01] based on what brother Branham said
[1:27:03] because we are preaching Jesus Christ
[1:27:06] according to the revelation of the
[1:27:09] mystery according to the message of the
[1:27:12] hour based on the definition of brother
[1:27:15] Branham the org tabs Christ
[1:27:19] everybody clear
[1:27:21] praise the Lord
[1:27:23] trying to do God the service without
[1:27:25] being in his will
[1:27:26] the ark was done
[1:27:29] the word we know that's right because
[1:27:33] the art is
[1:27:35] he never he doesn't contradict himself
[1:27:38] Christ is the word are you there and
[1:27:41] Christ is the word see the ark or the
[1:27:46] word I want to go down
[1:27:49] they got a Methodist Arc
[1:27:52] a Baptist Ark a presbyterian Ark
[1:27:57] everybody's going into this Arc for a
[1:28:00] Great Tribulation coming glory to God I
[1:28:03] was baptized in the Methodist Ark the
[1:28:06] Presbyterian the Pentecostal art there
[1:28:09] is only one Earth that is Jesus Christ
[1:28:13] and he is the word So based on the
[1:28:18] second definition the ark represented
[1:28:21] the word which is Christ everybody clear
[1:28:26] praise the Lord but when Moses made
[1:28:30] the
[1:28:32] Caribbean when he made the Throne of God
[1:28:36] he puts the Caribbeans around the throne
[1:28:40] but when Ezekiel Saw the Caribbeans he
[1:28:44] saw that there was a throne God was
[1:28:47] there the pillar of fire was there the
[1:28:50] Caribbeans were there but they were also
[1:28:53] the presence of the wheels but when
[1:28:57] Moses met the Ark of the Covenant Moses
[1:29:01] never made the wheels
[1:29:04] everybody following me
[1:29:06] there were nothing in the wheels what
[1:29:09] does the will means in the vision of
[1:29:13] Ezekiel
[1:29:15] brother Branham
[1:29:16] what is the symbol here brother Branham
[1:29:19] what is it
[1:29:21] it means that this God speaking about
[1:29:24] the four living creature
[1:29:26] these gods
[1:29:27] was God's Ark
[1:29:30] they were in Germany because the ark was
[1:29:34] moving from one place to another are you
[1:29:38] there
[1:29:38] all right Rolling On Wheels when Ezekiel
[1:29:43] Saw them but when John saw them in the
[1:29:47] Book of Revelation chapter 4 they had
[1:29:50] already come into the right position in
[1:29:53] heaven but Moses was told to reproduce
[1:29:57] Heaven on the Earth are you there that
[1:30:01] was not the end time yet
[1:30:03] that was the beginning of God dealing
[1:30:07] with a nation but instead of Moses
[1:30:10] putting the words down Moses did not put
[1:30:14] the will
[1:30:16] right everybody following me
[1:30:18] but Moses look at the Ark in heaven in
[1:30:24] heaven when John unfold Heaven no ways
[1:30:29] you follow me
[1:30:30] but is it yourself there are wheels
[1:30:33] meaning the ark was moving from one
[1:30:37] place to another
[1:30:41] the Ark of God was on Earth it from
[1:30:45] place to
[1:30:47] is saying here that when the Ark of the
[1:30:51] Covenant was moving from place to place
[1:30:54] he was rolling on will but when Moses
[1:30:58] made the Earth Moses never made wheels
[1:31:06] meant he was in trouble
[1:31:09] they took it all the way through the
[1:31:11] Wilderness you see now
[1:31:13] and all the way into the Temple and so
[1:31:16] forth brother Branham said he was
[1:31:19] rolling on Wheels when you look at the
[1:31:22] Ark of the Covenant
[1:31:24] he was now rolling on wheels
[1:31:26] he was actually carried by people
[1:31:34] it's coming up clear
[1:31:36] but now it will receive up
[1:31:39] because the church is over speaking
[1:31:42] about John
[1:31:43] and it's received up in glory see it is
[1:31:46] stationary now in heaven with all angels
[1:31:51] and things around them so the wheels
[1:31:54] that Ezekiel Saw were talking about the
[1:31:59] ark being in Journey or the Earth moving
[1:32:03] from one place to another justification
[1:32:06] sanctification baptism of the Holy
[1:32:08] Spirit Ephesus Smyrna there were
[1:32:11] somebody in the midst of the seven
[1:32:13] golden Candlestick that were journeying
[1:32:17] in the midst of the church the ark was
[1:32:20] moving
[1:32:21] [Music]
[1:32:22] everybody clear
[1:32:24] how is those doing how are those wheels
[1:32:27] made
[1:32:28] why some people can keep the victory now
[1:32:32] you know Ezekiel say it again talking
[1:32:34] about Ezekiel
[1:32:36] and he this same prophet he saw it as a
[1:32:41] will in the middle of her will turning
[1:32:46] in the air
[1:32:48] now these Wills how are they made
[1:32:51] brother Brian I'm saying now Wheels
[1:32:53] first
[1:32:54] there is a realm
[1:32:57] he back up again there is the tire
[1:33:01] everybody knows what the tire means
[1:33:04] there is the ram everybody knows what
[1:33:07] the ram means there is death
[1:33:10] right there and there is the Hub
[1:33:14] so the middle right there off the wheel
[1:33:17] that was in the middle of the wheel
[1:33:20] brother brought him describe it like a
[1:33:22] harbor
[1:33:24] but what does the Hub represent
[1:33:29] let's ask Ezekiel
[1:33:32] that great prophet Ezekiel come here
[1:33:35] Ezekiel
[1:33:36] what one of them is calling Ezekiel
[1:33:40] of your glory

[1:34:31] of the wheel was the harbor
[1:34:38] in the world every smoke

[1:36:28] and God by the pardon of what
[1:36:33] can you preach with me by the pardon of
[1:36:36] what
[1:36:37] Chariot of the
[1:36:39] so the Jeremy had a chariot
[1:36:44] no wonder every one of them had a will
[1:36:49] so their Chariot was carrying the Ark of
[1:36:53] the Covenant
[1:36:57] everybody clear from the Bible
[1:37:01] but when Moses met the Orca Moses God
[1:37:06] never taught Moses make the will
[1:37:10] instead of the will God say Moses make
[1:37:15] two steps
[1:37:21] are you there
[1:37:23] make two steps to stay for one two carry
[1:37:28] the Earth but the Ark of the Covenant
[1:37:31] was carried on her chariot
[1:37:34] the head four Cherry beans and every
[1:37:38] cherubim had her will but instead of God
[1:37:42] telling Moses to make the wheels God
[1:37:46] said just make the steps and those
[1:37:50] stairs will be the one bearing the Orca
[1:37:56] Moses made here safe
[1:38:00] and maybe the children came in the
[1:38:02] morning they say Prophet Moses
[1:38:05] we saw the ark we saw the staff
[1:38:10] but where are the wheels
[1:38:12] are you making them tomorrow
[1:38:15] Moses said according to what he shows me
[1:38:18] no wheels
[1:38:20] they went back to their father they said
[1:38:22] Daddy Daddy Moses is making an ark he's
[1:38:25] making stuff but no will how is this
[1:38:29] Earth gonna move
[1:38:32] are you there praise the Lord
[1:38:36] if they charge the Caribbeans where had
[1:38:40] the chariot
[1:38:42] are you following me
[1:38:43] a chariot
[1:38:47] had an action
[1:38:49] I'm going slowly
[1:38:51] are you there everybody saying that
[1:38:54] the answer is a road
[1:38:58] are you following me
[1:39:00] it's a stove
[1:39:02] it's a stuff that connects the will into
[1:39:07] the chariot
[1:39:11] foreign
[1:39:15] praise the Lord but when the ark had to
[1:39:19] be carried
[1:39:20] instead of Moses bringing wills and
[1:39:25] hooking the will into the staff so they
[1:39:31] can begin to move their Ark Moses said
[1:39:34] the ark is going to be carried by people
[1:39:48] never give you a scripture
[1:39:50] but when we look at the ark the ark was
[1:39:54] moving by some Christian
[1:39:59] are you following me
[1:40:02] then there's two Axel those two stairs
[1:40:07] were put on the shoulder of the prison
[1:40:15] are you there
[1:40:16] so now when delivered move to the right
[1:40:21] the ark move to the right when the liver
[1:40:25] move to the left the ark moves to the
[1:40:27] left
[1:40:31] praise the Lord
[1:40:33] what does he mean
[1:40:35] brother Branham
[1:40:37] you got to go back the way God said to
[1:40:40] do it
[1:40:42] do it then put it upon the shoulder of
[1:40:46] delivered and that was over there
[1:40:54] are we okay
[1:40:56] are we okay
[1:40:57] so the wheels of the Ark
[1:41:02] have to be hooked
[1:41:04] to a hub
[1:41:07] because the harbor was the middle part
[1:41:10] here
[1:41:11] and the answer coming to the hub of your
[1:41:15] car and begin to move it because if you
[1:41:18] take the axle off you will leave your
[1:41:21] car your car will be sitting on the
[1:41:23] wheel it's not going to move but the
[1:41:26] actual first bear the lord of the
[1:41:29] vehicle and also engage into the Hub and
[1:41:33] remove the wheel
[1:41:37] God said let them put it on the shoulder
[1:41:41] in either way the Hub it was the heart
[1:41:47] look
[1:41:51] the ark the word is not to be back upon
[1:41:57] a new denomination
[1:41:59] upon the theory of some men but in the
[1:42:05] Ark itself never sat on the priest
[1:42:11] are you there he was the staff that sat
[1:42:15] on the fist the stairs were the one
[1:42:19] engaging with the priest
[1:42:23] thank you
[1:42:26] the word of God is not to be handled by
[1:42:29] denomination
[1:42:31] it is to be handled by the heart of a
[1:42:34] man
[1:42:37] brother Stephen The Hub they spoke the
[1:42:41] ram
[1:42:43] are you trying to say that these people
[1:42:45] were Rams
[1:42:47] a thinking man's filter
[1:42:49] as I spoke this morning and last Sunday
[1:42:52] morning on that wheel
[1:42:55] in the middle of the
[1:42:58] or a leader inside
[1:43:02] okay
[1:43:04] remember Living Word Tabernacle
[1:43:07] we taught you that in the heart of a man
[1:43:12] there was a small compartment when they
[1:43:15] were no blood going into it you remember
[1:43:18] that and that was the occupancy of the
[1:43:21] show so when they say heart in the Bible
[1:43:25] they are referring to sow and brother
[1:43:28] Brahman said the Hub
[1:43:31] the little will in the middle of the way
[1:43:34] was ah
[1:43:36] that's where the Paul all the staff have
[1:43:40] to be engaged
[1:43:46] [Music]
[1:43:47] on the inside of the
[1:43:51] how that the spirit on the outside
[1:43:55] between the soul and the
[1:43:58] just like the worms have pot
[1:44:03] three parts
[1:44:05] the human being also has three parts
[1:44:09] like a rainbow like a will
[1:44:15] foreign
[1:44:24] [Applause]
[1:44:29] are you there
[1:44:31] God told Moses make the ark make the
[1:44:35] power don't put will but I'm gonna use
[1:44:38] man to move the gospel I'm going to use
[1:44:41] men to move the world

[1:49:50] are you there only necessary a little
[1:49:53] bit let's go to the hospital a little
[1:49:54] bit let's go to the hospital
[1:49:57] and that's Cosmic light that is in you
[1:50:00] that you are made of full of light cell
[1:50:03] now that is Cosmic life
[1:50:07] where are we going brother Stephen
[1:50:09] why is God engaging into men
[1:50:13] then the Chicana Glory range from their
[1:50:17] Mercy Seat speaking about Moses
[1:50:19] one day and he said on another
[1:50:23] Tabernacle the Lord will come suddenly
[1:50:27] you remember suddenly are you there amen
[1:50:30] this one the father judges no man but
[1:50:33] he's committing all judgment to the son
[1:50:35] God judgments it speaking about Jesus
[1:50:38] Christ you speak against me I will be
[1:50:41] he'll be forgiven
[1:50:43] speak another one coming another Mercy
[1:50:46] Seat because Jesus taught them that if
[1:50:49] you insult me if you blood use the will
[1:50:53] because I'm gonna use man
[1:50:59] one word against said will never be
[1:51:02] forgiven paragraph 32
[1:51:05] 32 now the first Throne was in
[1:51:10] that's what Moses saw that's what John
[1:51:13] saw
[1:51:14] the judgments it the second Throne was
[1:51:17] in
[1:51:18] everybody clear and the third Throne is
[1:51:21] in
[1:51:25] we clear
[1:51:28] Satan has no this all along
[1:51:31] he also wanted wants to enjoy men even
[1:51:37] as God sowed us
[1:51:39] but God has reserved to himself that
[1:51:43] right
[1:51:45] Satan only enter his own children
[1:51:50] [Music]
[1:51:51] are you there the Bible said send them
[1:51:55] enter Judah because Judah was a son of
[1:52:00] perdition Perdition means hell Judah
[1:52:05] came from hell that therefore have claim
[1:52:08] on him
[1:52:09] but the devil does not help claim on you
[1:52:12] because you come from God and you are
[1:52:16] going back to God
[1:52:21] sometimes he acts in denial he want to
[1:52:25] ignore that that's why it's better to
[1:52:27] remind him I am not your child I come
[1:52:31] from God I'm gonna go to God
[1:52:35] go get in the Pope
[1:52:38] let me
[1:52:40] because the pope come from the
[1:52:43] bottomless people he comes from hell not
[1:52:47] me I come from God I am going back to
[1:52:51] God
[1:52:55] Satan could not and cannot do that he
[1:52:59] does not have creative power the only
[1:53:02] way for Satan to accomplish what he
[1:53:04] wanted to do was to enter the serpent in
[1:53:07] Eden even as he entered by evil spirit
[1:53:11] in the
[1:53:13] Edgar and gatherer God does not enter
[1:53:19] but Satan came and will to accomplish
[1:53:22] his
[1:53:23] that's why brother Branham said when you
[1:53:26] see an animal a lion killing somebody
[1:53:28] telling somebody brother Branham saying
[1:53:31] that's Satan
[1:53:34] are you there but God does not enter
[1:53:38] animal God enter human beings
[1:53:43] that's why he taught Moses make the poor
[1:53:47] but do not make the wheel I'm gonna
[1:53:49] borrow human will just like God borrow
[1:53:53] the will of Christ
[1:53:56] are you there
[1:53:59] and they flew
[1:54:02] and had got eyes
[1:54:04] Within
[1:54:06] without within and behind this is
[1:54:09] Revelation chapter
[1:54:11] four it's speaking about the Caribbean
[1:54:13] with eyes
[1:54:15] he spoke off there
[1:54:19] remember the wheels have also
[1:54:23] and they had the spirit of the
[1:54:27] so the intelligence of the Caribbeans
[1:54:30] were in the wheel
[1:54:34] okay
[1:54:36] they know what was witches and which
[1:54:40] shall come
[1:54:42] for they were us right at the seat so
[1:54:45] close till there was not even human the
[1:54:49] different type Temple God but this is
[1:54:51] The Mercy Seat guard the throne God the
[1:54:55] throne right up next to God living
[1:54:56] creature next things to God standing
[1:54:59] there their intelligence they know what
[1:55:02] was witches and what shall come they had
[1:55:06] eyes without showing what they could see
[1:55:10] what was to come with eyes within knows
[1:55:14] everything now and as in the back which
[1:55:17] knoweth what was
[1:55:19] which was which is which shall come
[1:55:23] reflecting through the churches he that
[1:55:28] was witches and shall come Jesus Christ
[1:55:32] the same
[1:55:33] today and
[1:55:35] that's why a prophet have an ability to
[1:55:40] get into your life and go back 20 years
[1:55:43] and go back forward and tell you I see
[1:55:46] you at the doctor in 1964 now you are
[1:55:51] standing here but I can see you also
[1:55:53] heal go your faith has healed you
[1:55:57] saw it before you even experience it
[1:56:00] because that anointing of the Caribbeans
[1:56:03] it's there in since the past it seems
[1:56:06] the present and it sees the future
[1:56:11] are you there
[1:56:14] he comes through the feet
[1:56:17] come back out through Wesley then in the
[1:56:20] Pentecost of the tongues in the lips see
[1:56:23] now it is in the
[1:56:26] prophetic of Malachi
[1:56:29] the next is the
[1:56:33] intelligence and we have no intelligence
[1:56:37] of our own it is his we have no sight of
[1:56:41] our own how can a man foresee those
[1:56:44] things he can do it it is God himself
[1:56:48] why because God have borrowed men
[1:56:54] that's why the gospel is always carried
[1:56:59] by men
[1:57:03] God could have sent the angel down
[1:57:08] he could have let the angel come himself
[1:57:11] but instead of that he sent the angel to
[1:57:14] speak through the voice of Her
[1:57:17] that's why we say this force is not the
[1:57:20] voice of brother Branham it is the voice
[1:57:23] of God
[1:57:29] the tone is brother Branham
[1:57:32] but the voice behind the voice is God
[1:57:42] always use men for his work
[1:57:45] is that right he don't use organizations
[1:57:49] or so forth and Mechanical Devices but
[1:57:54] he uses
[1:57:56] the Holy Spirit fell upon that is God's
[1:58:00] instrument here on
[1:58:02] that's why he taught Moses don't do the
[1:58:05] wheels
[1:58:07] I'm gonna move the ark but they all cut
[1:58:10] the Covenant will be moving by men men
[1:58:14] will be the one preaching the gospel man
[1:58:18] will be the one moving the gospel
[1:58:24] God does not fall upon denomination God
[1:58:28] does not fall upon mechanical device God
[1:58:31] the Holy Spirit fell upon man is God's
[1:58:35] and the hardest things that God have
[1:58:38] ever had to do was to get one
[1:58:41] to believe
[1:58:46] are you there
[1:58:49] let me skip this one
[1:58:52] the wills of God's power
[1:58:55] and Kingdom can't turn
[1:58:58] because we got old sludgy dirty what
[1:59:05] are you there so if God need to borrow
[1:59:08] you you gotta make sure you don't have
[1:59:12] your heart your answer is clean
[1:59:16] are you there because God cannot engage
[1:59:19] his power in an unclean vessel because
[1:59:23] power without character is satanic
[1:59:31] dirty acts of Greece in it that don't
[1:59:34] belong there in other words you are made
[1:59:37] for something higher than the life
[1:59:40] you're living now
[1:59:41] are you there what we need tonight is
[1:59:45] the washing by the
[1:59:49] by the word the true love
[1:59:51] and the holy God's power to come back
[1:59:54] into the church to start the wheels of
[1:59:58] God's economy timing in other words you
[2:00:02] need the watching so that God can come
[2:00:05] down and borrow your will and begin to
[2:00:08] move his gospel
[2:00:11] foreign
[2:00:21] cleansing that is not natural water the
[2:00:25] water of Separation was not at water at
[2:00:28] all it was the ashes of the heifer that
[2:00:31] has been killed and led that Assad with
[2:00:34] her blood streak how many times
[2:00:37] you know what it means right over the
[2:00:40] door Exodus chapter 19 where are we
[2:00:43] getting there that sweet Holy Spirit
[2:00:46] that's something in human heart make it
[2:00:50] call out with the love of God to do the
[2:00:53] will of God not to jump up and down and
[2:00:56] holler not run all over the building not
[2:01:00] speak with tongues not pray for the sick
[2:01:02] not prophesy not interpret die what I'm
[2:01:06] talking about that is the outward
[2:01:09] something
[2:01:11] what about them didn't say it's not good
[2:01:13] bad that's good
[2:01:16] that is something of the spirit that's
[2:01:18] right in other words we're okay with
[2:01:20] that but if there is not something
[2:01:24] in there to Anchor you with that if you
[2:01:30] don't have a stage
[2:01:31] that is put in there to connect you to
[2:01:35] the ark
[2:01:37] are you there
[2:01:39] it does not do a bit of good
[2:01:43] we have the word we have the message we
[2:01:48] need the staff to connect you to the
[2:01:51] word
[2:01:52] are you there
[2:01:54] it's a will
[2:01:56] I was talking
[2:01:57] without uh
[2:02:01] happening if that is not anchor back
[2:02:04] thereby love it shall do harm than he
[2:02:09] does
[2:02:10] in other words you cannot have the gift
[2:02:13] without The Giver of love
[2:02:16] if you don't have that you're gonna
[2:02:19] cause trouble
[2:02:22] because give them calling are without
[2:02:25] repentance and these little things that
[2:02:28] is moving on now these leaves are what
[2:02:32] mother
[2:02:34] that is stunning all came by the program
[2:02:38] of who
[2:02:39] so when God gives you your natural life
[2:02:42] God has a purpose for that God have an
[2:02:47] intent for that God have a program for
[2:02:51] your life
[2:02:53] are you there
[2:02:54] that's right so he knows how to take
[2:02:58] care of them
[2:02:59] if you just let him have them
[2:03:02] so what you need to do take your wheels
[2:03:04] and do what surrender them to the one
[2:03:08] who program you
[2:03:10] Hallelujah
[2:03:12] if you keep them you shall lose them
[2:03:16] if you give it to him you shall find
[2:03:19] them that's why but you'll be sure to
[2:03:22] give it to him and give all your
[2:03:25] and your
[2:03:27] to him tonight now that he can have the
[2:03:32] right way in your
[2:03:34] remember the Paul walls were enough
[2:03:37] open your heart slow down
[2:03:40] that can engage

[2:03:49] is unbelief and the weight that boosts
[2:03:52] easily beset you that we might run this
[2:03:55] race with passion that set before us
[2:03:57] looking to the example Jesus Christ God

[2:04:04] will that moved the oak where human
[2:04:08] being

[2:06:25] verse 13.
[2:06:27] thus they gave the children of who
[2:06:31] Aaron the what
[2:06:33] so the priests or the children of Aaron
[2:06:37] were given cities
[2:06:40] are you there
[2:06:42] Hebron with her suburb to be City of
[2:06:46] Refuge for the slave and libna with her

[2:07:21] of priests
[2:07:24] the sons of Aaron
[2:07:26] Moses was given the sons of Heron City
[2:07:30] Joshua they say you take this you take
[2:07:32] this you take this you take this and in
[2:07:35] the land of Judah he was in Judah they
[2:07:38] gave the priests the city called
[2:07:40] bedshames among those cities
[2:07:42] nine cities out of those two tribes
[2:07:46] everybody clear
[2:07:48] all right let's go to first Samuel
[2:07:51] what is wrong with vegetables about the
[2:07:53] Stephen
[2:07:54] let's go to verse
[2:07:57] six
[2:08:00] Israel have seen the son of ela sinned
[2:08:03] and when the sons of ela sins
[2:08:07] God came and brought judgment to Israel
[2:08:11] Israel went to war and when they want to
[2:08:14] own the two sons of Ilah took the Ark of
[2:08:17] the Covenant when do we fit and thought
[2:08:20] that because the Earth is there they're
[2:08:22] going to go ahead and win the battle for
[2:08:24] some reason the Philistine heal them
[2:08:27] overcame them and took the Ark of the
[2:08:30] Covenant and left with it when the Ark
[2:08:33] of the Covenant went into the cities of
[2:08:37] the Philistine it began to destroy and
[2:08:40] to kill the people even their own God
[2:08:43] were broken down
[2:08:45] the Philistine look they say ah
[2:08:48] this is a hot potato
[2:08:50] are you there take the shark and send it
[2:08:54] back to where he belongs are you there
[2:08:56] that's first Samuel chapter six and the
[2:08:59] Ark of the Lord was in the country of
[2:09:01] the philistine
[2:09:03] you know seven right
[2:09:06] not Sixth Man not five only under seven
[2:09:09] right it's on the seven when they say
[2:09:14] lose it are you there
[2:09:18] seven months
[2:09:21] do you know that David used the sword of
[2:09:23] Goliath for his life
[2:09:26] are you there the sword came with
[2:09:29] Goliath are you there and David took it
[2:09:33] from Goliath and sharp Goliath with that
[2:09:36] sword are you there denominational being
[2:09:40] as the Bible we pulled the Bible from
[2:09:43] them and we chop them with the same
[2:09:45] Bible
[2:09:49] are you there
[2:09:50] are you there when it came with goliathy
[2:09:53] the sword was in the shift it was a
[2:09:56] sealed word are you there it was a word
[2:10:00] that was failing David unveiled and went
[2:10:04] in some fell he chopped the head of
[2:10:06] Goliath you need the word unveil thank
[2:10:10] you
[2:10:16] and the Philistine called for the
[2:10:19] priests and the diviners saying what
[2:10:22] shall we do to the Ark of the Lord
[2:10:24] tell us where if we shall send it to its
[2:10:27] place
[2:10:28] and they say if you send it away the Ark
[2:10:31] of the god of Israel send it not empty
[2:10:34] these are the priests of the Philistine
[2:10:36] trying to do God a service to the best
[2:10:39] of their understanding are you there but
[2:10:42] in any words we turn him a trespass
[2:10:44] offering you behind the word they say we
[2:10:46] have sin in order to send this you need
[2:10:50] to take it and send this asking
[2:10:52] forgiveness
[2:10:53] everybody clear
[2:10:55] this is verse three and you shall be
[2:10:58] healed and it shall be known to you why
[2:11:01] his hand is not removed from you job one
[2:11:04] verse 7.
[2:11:05] now before therefore make a new what
[2:11:09] so the idea of making a cut
[2:11:13] to move the Ark of the Covenant was an
[2:11:18] idea from the philistine
[2:11:23] yes
[2:11:26] come here
[2:11:27] you're already clicking that's what I
[2:11:30] like about this church so the new card
[2:11:34] used as the wheels
[2:11:39] off the ark
[2:11:41] was the revelation of philistine
[2:11:51] was David born here
[2:11:56] okay all right make and take two milk
[2:12:00] cows on which there was to come New York
[2:12:04] they're doing to the best that's why God
[2:12:06] spoke Paul said of the years of
[2:12:09] ignorance he said when God was winking
[2:12:12] and letting Every Nation do us the will
[2:12:15] but this time Paul said now you need to
[2:12:17] repent
[2:12:20] if you need those scriptures see me
[2:12:22] after I'm trying to stay focused and
[2:12:25] bring the curves home from them
[2:12:27] and take the Ark of the Lord and lay it
[2:12:30] upon thee in other words the manufacture
[2:12:35] Wills made by men to move the ark
[2:12:45] but they were hidden did not know
[2:12:49] the best that we can
[2:12:51] and put the Jews of God which you return
[2:12:54] him a trespass suffering in a coffer by
[2:12:57] the side thereof and send it away that
[2:13:00] he may go
[2:13:01] watch verse 9 and see if he goes by the
[2:13:06] way of its own because to what
[2:13:10] why are those priests why they didn't
[2:13:13] say if he goes to devil
[2:13:18] they were oppressed
[2:13:20] they handle sacred stuff
[2:13:23] but they say we need a place where
[2:13:27] Israel have preached the handle sacred
[2:13:32] staff and let's say that there
[2:13:38] are you there
[2:13:40] then he has done us this great evil but
[2:13:44] if it's not then we shall know that is
[2:13:47] not his hand that's more does it was a
[2:13:49] chance that happened to us in other
[2:13:51] words we're gonna put the ark with the
[2:13:54] cows if they all take the direction of
[2:13:58] bed shemit we know that he was God
[2:14:00] whipping us
[2:14:02] if he goes into a different direction
[2:14:04] then he was just a natural occurrence of
[2:14:07] a pandemic it was just a Corona or
[2:14:10] something
[2:14:11] are you there okay
[2:14:14] but if he goes this way so the Quran is
[2:14:16] a whooping if he goes that way it was
[2:14:19] just to happen
[2:14:22] now it makes sense are you there
[2:14:26] let's go to verse 10 and the man did so
[2:14:29] and took two milk cow and tied them to
[2:14:32] the car and shut up their calves at home
[2:14:35] and they laid the Ark of the Lord upon
[2:14:37] the court and they covered with the mice
[2:14:40] of God and the images of the Emirates
[2:14:42] because God whipped them with that
[2:14:45] watch very carefully verse 12. are you
[2:14:48] there is everybody awake
[2:14:51] okay
[2:14:52] verse 12 and the cows took the
[2:14:57] who was driving the cow
[2:15:00] by the Robert Corden
[2:15:02] who was driving the cow
[2:15:05] they just took the ark they put it in
[2:15:09] the Kinder in the court without any
[2:15:13] driver
[2:15:15] they called themselves begin to sing
[2:15:22] you want me to read it let's read it
[2:15:25] and the cow took the straight away
[2:15:29] watch and went in the highway doing what
[2:15:34] brother Branham say they were singing
[2:15:39] because when David put the Ark of the
[2:15:42] Covenant David put musician around it as
[2:15:46] soon as the cow received the ark
[2:15:50] nobody gave them a GPS
[2:15:53] [Music]
[2:15:54] are you there nobody told them Gastonia
[2:15:58] is here Charlotte is here they turn
[2:16:01] around to Gastonia and they start
[2:16:05] no driver
[2:16:07] but when they are going they are going
[2:16:14] who is driving discount
[2:16:17] watch
[2:16:19] and verse 12 and the cow took the
[2:16:24] straight way to the way of what
[2:16:27] because beds are not have preached bless
[2:16:31] the man to have a tire shop
[2:16:39] in bed Summers there is priests there is
[2:16:43] Wheels there is tired
[2:16:49] are you there
[2:16:51] praise the Lord the ark verse 12
[2:16:54] Benjamins and went along the highway
[2:16:57] rowing singing as they went and
[2:17:02] turn not a sad to the
[2:17:06] or today
[2:17:08] you remember
[2:17:12] you got it
[2:17:14] the Caribbeans
[2:17:17] when they move they move
[2:17:21] they don't move to the right or to there
[2:17:25] so as soon as they put the ACT they
[2:17:28] carry beams took care of the charter
[2:17:32] are you there
[2:17:34] when you look you don't see nobody but
[2:17:37] the Kelly beams
[2:17:39] anointing hook
[2:17:42] the cow
[2:17:43] you don't move to the right you don't
[2:17:46] move to the left that's our movement
[2:17:49] we're gonna direct you where you gonna
[2:17:52] find new tires to better
[2:17:59] are you there
[2:18:02] knowing turning not to the right or to
[2:18:05] the left and the lord of the Philistine
[2:18:08] went after them to the border of
[2:18:10] vegetables in Judah
[2:18:12] and they are betterment were whipping
[2:18:16] what there
[2:18:17] he was in the Harvest Time
[2:18:21] when the shark the life have left the
[2:18:25] shark the life is in the grain
[2:18:29] it is in that time in the seven months
[2:18:33] that the Caribbean begin to bring the
[2:18:36] ark to bed Shemesh
[2:18:41] this message is everywhere are you there
[2:18:45] harvest in the valley and they lift up
[2:18:48] their eyes and saw the ark and we judge
[2:18:51] to see it watch everybody awake
[2:18:55] verse 14 and they called verse 14 and
[2:18:59] the court came into the field of who
[2:19:06] I didn't write the Bible my friend
[2:19:09] who was Joshua
[2:19:13] work with Joshua which is the top of the
[2:19:18] Holy Spirit
[2:19:20] because the Caribbeans were the one
[2:19:23] directing and the Caribbean always run
[2:19:26] up with the pillar of Fire
[2:19:33] so there are nothing of the Caribbeans
[2:19:36] were following Joshua

[2:21:31] lamb who was slain before the foundation
[2:21:33] of the world but this stone is a
[2:21:37] revelation higher than ever
[2:21:43] let's go back to verse 12.
[2:21:46] verse 14 and the court came in the field
[2:21:49] of Joshua where the holy spirit is the
[2:21:53] priest under the Holy Spirit
[2:21:55] are you there

[2:22:00] was a great revelation
[2:22:03] of able the great revelation of the
[2:22:07] slaying of dilemma and in the Book of
[2:22:10] Revelation 5 when they say who is why
[2:22:13] the two
[2:22:15] take the book and break the seals
[2:22:18] they say it's what the lion but when he
[2:22:21] was coming he was coming

[2:22:24] a greater Revelation than ever
[2:22:33] are you there
[2:22:35] First Watch verse 14. a great Stone and
[2:22:40] they did what
[2:22:42] the split word

[2:22:50] camp in the field Father Brown I'm
[2:22:54] saying a field is a church when the word
[2:22:57] came in that church of Joshua are you
[2:23:00] there in that church there was a great
[2:23:04] Revelation the priest took the ark but

[2:23:39] David pulled the sword but he's chopping
[2:23:42] Goliath Goliath was the carrier of the
[2:23:46] soul but Goliath is a Philistine I don't
[2:23:50] need him he's an enemy he's against God
[2:23:53] I need the sword but I'm gonna destroy
[2:23:56] him we need the ark but we don't need
[2:23:59] denominational system
[2:24:05] [Music]
[2:24:06] we don't need Baptist saying the message
[2:24:09] we don't need Methodist in the message
[2:24:12] we don't need Catholicism in the message
[2:24:17] give us the scripture give us the Bible
[2:24:20] but not your Creed not your Dogma
[2:24:28] are you there
[2:24:30] destroy Court
[2:24:32] and offered the cow not only the card
[2:24:36] even the power that was pulling the cart
[2:24:40] they took it slightly
[2:24:45] a perverted revelation
[2:24:47] are you there but God let them go to the
[2:24:50] best of their understanding are you
[2:24:52] there
[2:24:53] are you there
[2:24:55] offered the cows a burnt offering to
[2:24:58] them

[2:25:10] what
[2:25:12] the correct tires are coming they say
[2:25:15] number one destroy all the The Creeks
[2:25:19] destroy all the Joel Austin although the
[2:25:24] Jimmy strugged remove them remove remove
[2:25:26] them Laura's Larkins
[2:25:29] put them away put them in there put them
[2:25:31] there put him there now
[2:25:35] delivered when the hook
[2:25:38] click click
[2:25:43] correctly
[2:25:46] like in Sabino Canyon when brother
[2:25:49] Branham was crying when the sword came
[2:25:52] when he struck the hand of brother
[2:25:55] brothers
[2:25:57] in other words he click click
[2:26:00] let go
[2:26:04] are you there
[2:26:06] delivered took down the Ark of the Lord
[2:26:10] and the coffee that was with him
[2:26:13] wearing the Jews of God was there and
[2:26:16] put them under
[2:26:18] on that great Revelation they didn't
[2:26:21] have only the ark they have the Oak and
[2:26:24] the great Revelation so they took the
[2:26:27] ark and put it on the Revelation they
[2:26:30] took the Bible and put it upon the
[2:26:33] message
[2:26:35] [Music]
[2:26:37] that's how you understand your Bible you
[2:26:40] understand your Bible by the message
[2:26:50] are you there a great message a great
[2:26:54] Revelation that's where one come to the
[2:26:57] prophet you take the word you put it
[2:27:00] there then you begin to worship God
[2:27:05] are you there
[2:27:07] are you there
[2:27:08] so the wheels
[2:27:11] are human beings not the denominational
[2:27:14] card
[2:27:15] the nomination of God you kill it
[2:27:18] destroy it you don't need it
[2:27:22] now don't miss this they fail together
[2:27:25] because later on David came
[2:27:29] and David found the Ark of the Covenant
[2:27:32] in the house of amidad
[2:27:34] and David had the good desire he wanted
[2:27:38] the Earth to come back but instead of
[2:27:41] Consulting the prophet
[2:27:44] are you there
[2:27:46] are you there instead of Consulting the
[2:27:50] prophet
[2:27:51] he said I am a great David
[2:27:55] I was a small Shepherd now I am
[2:27:59] International
[2:28:00] everybody knows me everybody is afraid
[2:28:03] of David I'm a great king I don't think
[2:28:06] I need a prophet anymore
[2:28:09] are you there let me go let me go back
[2:28:11] to the philistine
[2:28:13] and get the idea
[2:28:17] are you there
[2:28:19] dancing who started with God went and
[2:28:23] pick up the cause and begin to move the
[2:28:26] Ark by the revelation of the Philistine
[2:28:30] trying to do God the service with that
[2:28:34] being of his will
[2:28:40] took a new card read your Bible took the
[2:28:44] cow and have drivers and people were
[2:28:47] sick Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus
[2:28:49] Hallelujah
[2:28:51] the anointing is there
[2:28:54] God just took a little stone and
[2:28:58] predestinated a stone somewhere
[2:29:03] maybe somebody was working in that field
[2:29:05] and he hit the rock said I need to
[2:29:08] remove that and something say leave that
[2:29:10] work
[2:29:10] and move around and that rock was coming
[2:29:15] and suddenly the ox hit it
[2:29:21] when the Earth's heated the ark began to
[2:29:24] move
[2:29:25] an innocent jealous we are in this we're
[2:29:29] going to support you we're gonna We're
[2:29:31] not gonna let this fall We're not gonna
[2:29:33] let this move fall I am with you I am
[2:29:35] with you I am with you
[2:29:39] when they touch the Earth God struck
[2:29:42] them
[2:29:45] innocent
[2:29:47] [Music]
[2:29:48] and the mind came back
[2:29:51] did you consult the prophet
[2:29:55] if you would want to buy the Prophet The
[2:29:59] Prophet will tell you your idea is good
[2:30:02] but you need the correct will to move
[2:30:06] the ark
[2:30:11] don't miss this
[2:30:13] they fell together because they had not
[2:30:16] consulted
[2:30:18] by going to the priest by going to the
[2:30:21] Theologian by going to the military
[2:30:24] forces to ask them whether it was a
[2:30:27] rocket that you shoot or he was not a
[2:30:30] rocket that you shoot
[2:30:31] U.S Air Force was that a rocket in 1963
[2:30:35] you're going to ask the military forces
[2:30:40] you're going to ask the Baptist about
[2:30:43] the message you're going to consult the
[2:30:46] Methodist to tell you about the message
[2:30:48] you're going to compare the message with
[2:30:51] Lawrence clerking with all those people
[2:30:56] and the military forces to give you
[2:31:00] report whether an airplane was flying or
[2:31:02] Not by doing that
[2:31:06] and not even considering their
[2:31:11] [Music]
[2:31:14] [Applause]
[2:31:18] nothing they did it
[2:31:22] they went and pick up the Oak and put it
[2:31:25] upon a new
[2:31:27] exactly what the Philistine do
[2:31:30] put it upon a new
[2:31:32] and you
[2:31:34] is going to we're gonna start a new move
[2:31:38] and not upon the God given or dead way
[2:31:43] to package it was supposed to be back on
[2:31:47] the shoulder off there
[2:31:48] but you see when you start round you
[2:31:52] want to keep on going
[2:31:54] you need to go back again
[2:32:02] brother Stephen
[2:32:03] we understand the wheels we understand
[2:32:06] everything
[2:32:07] or they are these two states we're gonna
[2:32:11] touch one of them
[2:32:13] and next Sunday we touch the second one
[2:32:15] okay let's get one of them then we drop
[2:32:18] to the airport
[2:32:19] take Zechariah Chapter 11.
[2:32:24] [Music]
[2:32:28] one of them
[2:32:30] if you dare you can say Amen
[2:32:33] The Mystery of the two states
[2:32:36] so now today when they say the will in
[2:32:38] the middle of the will
[2:32:40] you know now
[2:32:43] when Ezekiel saw him the wheel in the
[2:32:45] middle of the wheel he heard it we heard
[2:32:46] the world is the way
[2:32:54] chapter 11. are you there
[2:32:57] few people are you there
[2:33:00] Zechariah 11 chapter 4 that saved the
[2:33:04] Lord my God feed the flock of the
[2:33:07] so a flock that was predestinated to be
[2:33:11] killed
[2:33:12] the flock of the solder
[2:33:16] verse 5 whose possessor slayed them
[2:33:20] so God give this
[2:33:22] Shepherd flock instead of feeding the
[2:33:25] flock they begin to kill them
[2:33:27] spiritually
[2:33:31] slay them and hold themselves not guilty
[2:33:35] in other words there is no even a
[2:33:38] conscience to feel bad
[2:33:40] if you destroy you go back to the world
[2:33:43] that's your problem
[2:33:45] they can kill you
[2:33:47] all they need is your money
[2:33:50] they don't need you fight with your
[2:33:52] husband all you want
[2:33:54] we don't care
[2:33:57] are you there whose possess or slay them
[2:34:00] and hold themselves not guilty and they
[2:34:04] that sell them bless say blessed be the
[2:34:08] Lord for I am
[2:34:10] so the flock the church is not anymore
[2:34:14] about the caring of the people but it
[2:34:17] becomes a business a way of living to
[2:34:20] make money
[2:34:22] that's what you see in Pentecost for
[2:34:25] it's all about money getting the pastor
[2:34:28] a nice car getting the best of big money
[2:34:30] getting the pastor wife good getting the
[2:34:33] pastor uh uh what kids lives like
[2:34:37] princess
[2:34:39] but do whatever you do smoke
[2:34:46] he pays a lot of tight don't say nothing
[2:34:48] about it Don't Preach against that
[2:34:50] marriage and divorce
[2:34:53] [Music]
[2:34:54] because he's going to leave the church
[2:34:58] away with your CEO
[2:35:02] I am rich
[2:35:04] and their own Shepherd pitted them not
[2:35:07] they don't care it's a business they're
[2:35:10] selling them for I will no more pity the
[2:35:13] inhabitant of the land say they all but
[2:35:16] oh Lord I will deliver the man everyone
[2:35:19] into his neighbor's hand and into the
[2:35:22] hand of his King thank you brother David
[2:35:24] The Voice came back and they shall snap
[2:35:26] to the land out of the hand I will not
[2:35:28] deliver them
[2:35:30] verse 7 and I will feed the flock of the
[2:35:33] slaughter it becomes slaughtered to the
[2:35:35] shepherd even you oh poor off the flock
[2:35:38] and I took to me what
[2:35:42] okay
[2:35:44] there is a flock that became a play to
[2:35:48] the preacher a pray to the pastor the
[2:35:52] pastor don't care about the souls
[2:35:54] anymore as long as they want to be
[2:35:56] popular they want to make money they
[2:35:59] want to do everything they are living
[2:36:00] for their own belly God looked he said
[2:36:04] don't worry I'm gonna take care of this
[2:36:07] but I'm gonna take care of this boy
[2:36:12] they Ark of The Confident head
[2:36:16] you okay
[2:36:19] to Steve and I took to me two steps
[2:36:23] the one are called
[2:36:26] the correct translation is favored
[2:36:30] you can look it up
[2:36:33] the first Rod
[2:36:35] Zechariah call it Beauty the correct
[2:36:38] translation is favor
[2:36:40] or grace even those that have the Bible
[2:36:44] in French they will see called favor or
[2:36:46] Grace in French
[2:36:48] are you there look it up it says favor
[2:36:51] or Grace
[2:36:53] the one I'll call Beauty or Grace or
[2:36:56] favor and the other are called bands the
[2:37:01] correct translation of bands is Union
[2:37:06] you can look it up
[2:37:08] and I fed the flock so there is two
[2:37:12] steps here that God is gonna use
[2:37:15] to feed his flock one step is called
[2:37:20] favor or Grace another is called Union
[2:37:27] one bring you guys
[2:37:30] another one unites you
[2:37:37] verse 9.
[2:37:40] let me jump to verse 10.
[2:37:42] and I who's talking God
[2:37:46] I took my
[2:37:48] it's called Steve it's called staff it's
[2:37:50] called Road
[2:37:52] or Pope I took my stuff even beauty or
[2:37:57] Grace
[2:37:58] and I and carry the sander so God took
[2:38:03] this step that is called Grace and God
[2:38:07] broke it
[2:38:11] praise the Lord
[2:38:14] that I may break my Covenant
[2:38:17] which I have made with all the people so
[2:38:21] the people have a covenant with God
[2:38:23] but with that people God will bring a
[2:38:28] state
[2:38:29] but God will take that step and break it
[2:38:33] to break his Covenant with his people
[2:38:38] everybody clear
[2:38:40] and it was broken in that day
[2:38:44] and so the poor of the flock which is
[2:38:46] the flock of the slaughter that waited
[2:38:49] upon me so that Frank was waiting upon
[2:38:54] God to come
[2:38:56] God sent them a safe
[2:38:59] that staff was Grace and they took the
[2:39:03] staff God broke the slave to break the
[2:39:06] Covenant with the people so that the
[2:39:09] elect of that people will understand
[2:39:13] catch something
[2:39:23] knew that it was the word of the Lord
[2:39:26] everybody there
[2:39:29] and I this is beauty we're talking about
[2:39:31] beauty or Grace and I say to them if you
[2:39:36] think good give me my past
[2:39:39] if not for bear
[2:39:40] so they waited for my price
[2:39:44] how much
[2:39:46] 30 pieces of what
[2:39:49] so that's five
[2:39:52] Congress
[2:39:54] when the evaluated by those people
[2:39:58] they said it costs 30 pieces of
[2:40:05] you see with that stuff is
[2:40:09] you see who's that save is
[2:40:11] the law came by Moses but
[2:40:15] came by
[2:40:22] are we okay
[2:40:25] praise the Lord
[2:40:27] verse 13 and the Lord said to me cast it
[2:40:31] to The Potter's hand to the Border a
[2:40:33] goodly pass that I was present in other
[2:40:37] words valued add them of them and I took
[2:40:42] 30 pieces of silver
[2:40:45] and casted to the borders In The House
[2:40:47] of the
[2:40:49] so
[2:40:50] let's stop there because that's the
[2:40:52] first thing so we got two steps here
[2:40:56] we got Grace
[2:40:58] and Union
[2:41:00] are you there they're two slaves
[2:41:03] now we are we're gonna talk about Grace
[2:41:06] and next time we pick up on Union
[2:41:08] with Grace we found that there is a
[2:41:11] prophecy
[2:41:12] the prophecy said when Grace come
[2:41:15] we're going to evaluate him
[2:41:17] and when we evaluate him we're gonna
[2:41:20] sell him for 30 pieces of silver
[2:41:25] because God will break him and by
[2:41:29] breaking him he's breaking his
[2:41:31] confidence with his people
[2:41:35] we okay
[2:41:38] take Matthew 27.
[2:41:51] if you're there you can say Amen
[2:41:53] who was speaking about that prophecy
[2:41:56] which book did we hear
[2:41:59] right
[2:42:02] 27 Matthew 27 verse 3. if you dare you
[2:42:06] can say Amen
[2:42:08] then Judas
[2:42:11] which had betrayed him
[2:42:13] when he saw that he was condemned
[2:42:16] repented himself betray who
[2:42:21] and brought again there
[2:42:25] [Music]
[2:42:28] so that staff is somebody
[2:42:32] it is not a rod
[2:42:36] we okay
[2:42:38] 30 pieces of silver to the chief priest
[2:42:40] and Elder saying I have sinned in that I
[2:42:43] have betrayed the innocent blood and
[2:42:46] they said what is that to us see you to
[2:42:49] that
[2:42:49] and he cast down the third the pieces of
[2:42:52] silver in the temple
[2:42:55] remember take the pieces of silver and
[2:42:58] go to the temple in there throw it to
[2:43:01] the Border in the temple and deported
[2:43:04] and went and hang himself
[2:43:07] everybody there
[2:43:09] let me go to verse eight to save time
[2:43:11] wherefore
[2:43:14] that field was the field of
[2:43:18] To This Day verse 9 everybody wake up
[2:43:21] please
[2:43:22] and was fulfilled that which was spoken
[2:43:25] by
[2:43:26] stop
[2:43:29] who spoke when we read who gave the
[2:43:31] prophecy
[2:43:34] let's continue
[2:43:38] brother I'm saying here brother brought
[2:43:40] them say here it is different
[2:43:47] and then here he said this way oh let's
[2:43:50] throw out to the message
[2:43:52] the Bible say in Zechariah Matthew say
[2:43:56] it is in
[2:43:57] the day you're gonna find it in Jeremiah
[2:43:59] come and see me
[2:44:07] Nine Dead was fulfilled that which was
[2:44:10] spoken by
[2:44:11] Jeremiah the prophet saying they took
[2:44:14] what
[2:44:16] who spoke about 30 pieces
[2:44:22] amen put that together
[2:44:27] you see
[2:44:28] you see let's throw the Bible away it is
[2:44:31] not logical
[2:44:35] you see
[2:44:39] by Jeremiah the prophet saying they took

[2:48:46] and go and do what strike crust
[2:48:54] right
[2:48:56] Isaiah 53.
[2:48:58] probably the last one
[2:49:02] he was God that broke that
[2:49:05] take Isaiah 53 now and we're gonna land
[2:49:09] with Isaiah 53
[2:49:15] you there
[2:49:17] let's start by verse 3 verse 2 for he
[2:49:20] shall grow up before him as a tender
[2:49:22] plan and as the root out of a dry ground
[2:49:25] he has no form no comliness and when he
[2:49:28] we shall see him there is no
[2:49:31] do you see why the correct translation
[2:49:33] is not Beauty
[2:49:36] okay do you see that
[2:49:39] there is no
[2:49:41] beauty that we should desire of him
[2:49:44] he is what despite and rejected of man a
[2:49:49] Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief
[2:49:52] and we hid as he wear our faces from him
[2:49:56] he was despised and we esteem him
[2:50:00] there is still the Messiah for 30 pieces
[2:50:05] of silver
[2:50:07] devalue
[2:50:10] 30 pieces of silver are you there
[2:50:14] surely he has bought our grief and carry
[2:50:17] that sorrow yet we did the steam him
[2:50:20] what
[2:50:23] it's making off
[2:50:25] who Smite him
[2:50:28] who broke that stuff
[2:50:32] everybody clear sleeping of God and
[2:50:35] Afflicted verse 8 he was taken from
[2:50:39] prison and from judgment and who shall
[2:50:42] declare his generation for he was what
[2:50:46] God did it and of the land of the living
[2:50:48] for the transgression of my people was
[2:50:51] he
[2:50:53] and he made his grave with the wicked
[2:50:56] and with the witch in his death because
[2:50:59] he had done no violence neither was any
[2:51:02] deceit in his mouth yet he pleased us to
[2:51:05] do what
[2:51:06] he pleased God to break him
[2:51:11] that stealth Grace he pleased God to
[2:51:15] break it by by breaking that he's
[2:51:18] breaking his Covenant with Israel
[2:51:20] because he's going to the Gentile
[2:51:23] are you there
[2:51:24] but to touch the ark to enter the ark
[2:51:28] you need Christ
[2:51:33] and God need Wills
[2:51:37] and your Paul is Jesus Christ
[2:51:40] and Jesus need to connect to your heart
[2:51:49] together now
[2:51:52] he's smart The Rock what they came out
[2:51:55] and he was a type of crust
[2:51:58] in John 3 16 God so loved the world he
[2:52:03] gave his only begotten son that
[2:52:05] whosoever believe in him should not
[2:52:07] perish but have everlasting life a
[2:52:09] perishing people in the wilderness was
[2:52:12] saved by a smitten rock and a perishing
[2:52:16] people is safe today perishing in sin
[2:52:19] perishing in iniquity because the
[2:52:22] smitten Son of God taking their place
[2:52:25] water the spirit rolling out are you
[2:52:29] there in Hebrew 12 if you go there and
[2:52:33] you look over there the Bible says that
[2:52:35] we didn't come into a mountain that we
[2:52:38] cannot touch but we come to Mount Zion
[2:52:41] to the city of the Living God and in
[2:52:45] first John chapter 1 verse 1 the Bible
[2:52:48] says that what John spoke he said what
[2:52:53] we have heard what we have seen the Word
[2:52:56] of Life our hand have the did what
[2:53:00] they handle the Word of Life they handle
[2:53:03] the ark they handle God but to handle
[2:53:07] him by Christ
[2:53:09] are you there you cannot move the ark
[2:53:12] with your hand you cannot approach the
[2:53:15] presence of God yourself
[2:53:17] you cannot come into the presence of God
[2:53:19] yourself you're gonna be killed because
[2:53:22] all have sinned and come short of the
[2:53:25] glory of God before you approach God you
[2:53:29] need to make sure you are connected with
[2:53:32] the safe you are connected with trust
[2:53:34] when you are connected with Christ
[2:53:36] everything that you ask the father in
[2:53:39] mind then you can move the Earth to
[2:53:42] every direction you wanted if you want
[2:53:45] the world to heal your child the world
[2:53:47] will heal your child the word to get in
[2:53:50] your practice the word will get in your
[2:53:52] practice the word will affect your
[2:53:54] marriage the word will affect your
[2:53:56] children the word will affect your end
[2:53:58] the word will affect your health the
[2:54:01] word will affect your business it will
[2:54:03] affect everywhere but you must be
[2:54:05] connected to the right Paul in your
[2:54:08] heart removing all the grace removing
[2:54:10] all the sin removing all the iniquity
[2:54:13] cleaning up yourself by the washing of
[2:54:16] the world because because God wanted to
[2:54:18] borrow you God wants to use you in a
[2:54:22] different level in a different category
[2:54:24] but you need to clean up so he can bring
[2:54:28] Christ and who cries to you then you're
[2:54:30] gonna go with the wills of the Caribbean
[2:54:33] you're gonna move on with the wills of
[2:54:36] the Caribbeans you're gonna go with the
[2:54:38] wills of the Caribbean that's the father
[2:54:41] that's his makeup we're finishing here
[2:54:43] but if that man can only get back to God
[2:54:48] what Abraham is speaking about a man
[2:54:50] that was looking at the glass
[2:54:52] and he concentrate and the glass bust
[2:54:56] brother Branham say he was doing that by
[2:54:59] mental concentration brother random say
[2:55:01] what happened to that man the man had a
[2:55:04] gift
[2:55:05] he was built like that he's raised his
[2:55:08] life to a program like that and brother
[2:55:11] Branham said that shows that there was
[2:55:13] something made in that man
[2:55:15] he's fallen perverted condition but if
[2:55:19] that man can only get back to God
[2:55:23] are you there and let God get in him
[2:55:27] with that power turn loose of the
[2:55:30] kingdom of God
[2:55:31] he didn't have no conductor
[2:55:34] he doesn't have a pole to connect him
[2:55:37] are you there he was like a shotgun
[2:55:41] she said he can sing here with a
[2:55:43] beautiful voice
[2:55:44] that same voice can sing hip-hop
[2:55:47] but when it's in hip-hop it's outside of
[2:55:49] the will of God
[2:55:51] but when you take that voice you convert
[2:55:53] him you bring the Holy Spirit and cross
[2:55:56] hooked to that that voice can sing and
[2:55:58] somebody get healed
[2:56:00] are you there
[2:56:01] the Bible said he just flooded
[2:56:03] everywhere who brought upon them if that
[2:56:07] spirit that is in the man could be
[2:56:09] converted and put
[2:56:12] the pole the pole they save and put
[2:56:15] Christ in there connect him to Christ
[2:56:18] and then God borrow him as a will are
[2:56:22] you there where he is a conductor a
[2:56:25] conductor is a wire that conducted it's
[2:56:28] the pole you connect to Christ then the
[2:56:30] power of God is flowing through Christ
[2:56:32] into you are you there amen and let a
[2:56:35] man with that same faith in the
[2:56:37] conductor of the word of God he can
[2:56:40] raise the dead so that power that was
[2:56:43] shooting God breaking glasses can be
[2:56:46] utilized and directed differently and
[2:56:49] it's going to heal the people it was
[2:56:51] that same faith can raise the dead
[2:56:54] cleanse the leper cast out devil amen
[2:56:57] his fashion like a god
[2:57:01] he looks like God sure was that is the
[2:57:05] reason God was man
[2:57:07] man was God and this is his offspring
[2:57:11] man he is only trying to get a hold of
[2:57:15] man trying to get men into his hand God
[2:57:19] is only looking for your shoulder for
[2:57:23] your heart so he can connect the poor
