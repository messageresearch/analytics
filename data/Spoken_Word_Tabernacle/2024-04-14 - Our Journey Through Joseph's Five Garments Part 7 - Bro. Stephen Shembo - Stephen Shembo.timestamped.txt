[42:11] I said wow so I'm going to read it to
[42:14] you amen this message got everything
[42:18] everything is in this message it's
[42:20] amazing and usually when I prepare the
[42:22] sermon brother Bram is praying and
[42:24] before you know it whatever he says on
[42:25] the tape is what I over there then I
[42:28] know my direction is clear Amen brother
[42:31] Bram says this in the stature of a
[42:33] perfect man he says I'm getting started

[48:56] words except the bread which he did eat
[49:00] that the only thing he was worrying

[49:25] person a goodly person a goodly a
[49:29] handsome that's right that's what it
[49:31] means that's
[49:32] right nowhere have they mentioned about
[49:35] the beauty of
[49:38] Joseph it's only unveil in the house of
[49:46] Piper when he was in Canan nobody say he
[49:48] was a handsome boy nobody say he look
[49:52] good we only heard about the coat of
[49:54] many color but in the house of P we
[49:57] found something else about Joseph he

[50:04] on I was referring to my
[50:08] translator he look good I was referring
[50:11] to my translator don't say that I'm

[50:52] favored oh yes so if you look at him you
[50:56] will like him
[51:00] amen
[51:01] amen he says and he came to pass after
[51:06] these things when he was promoted so
[51:08] high everything under his hand that his
[51:11] master's
[51:16] wife if you notice his trouble started
[51:19] by a
[51:22] woman the trouble of David started by
[51:26] women
[51:29] amen you don't know that amen it was the
[51:31] women that start singing s have killed
[51:34] ,000 and David 10,000 that start the
[51:37] trouble because he was under
[51:40] mentorship under mentorship the trouble
[51:43] started with the
[51:46] sisters not you sister you are very
[51:51] good because this is a bad ill Fame
[51:54] woman but there is a key here then she
[51:58] cast her eyes upon Joseph in other words
[52:02] at the beginning it looks like she
[52:04] didn't see anything now he looks like
[52:06] why boy looking
[52:11] good why is a married
[52:14] woman looking at the young
[52:17] man
[52:20] brother lock it for the married people

[52:35] line you got to read between the
[52:39] line no problem let me leave it alone
[52:42] they say Amen you heard amen but he
[52:46] refused and said to his master's wife
[52:50] behold my master knows not what is with

[53:20] much amen amen he said and he knows not
[53:23] what is with me in the house and he has
[53:25] committed
[53:26] all that he has to my hand there is none
[53:31] greater in this house than
[53:36] I nobody in the house of Piper that is
[53:39] greater than Joseph the top is Piper
[53:43] himself so from the house of Piper you
[53:46] can see the position of this
[53:48] boy amen amen none greater than I
[53:52] neither has he kept back anything
[53:56] from me but thee you you are the only
[54:01] thing I cannot
[54:06] touch everybody okay everybody good amen
[54:10] so if we look in the house of part the
[54:13] top number one is
[54:17] p amen amen and his
[54:22] wife amen then you got Joseph
[54:28] then everybody else down amen so the
[54:33] highest position is Piper and his wife
[54:38] because the two
[54:41] are amen amen so Joseph say everything
[54:45] done here belong to
[54:47] me it's under my care the only position
[54:51] I cannot
[54:53] reach is this one because if I touch
[54:57] this
[54:59] one I have entered the territory of
[55:07] Piper as long as I don't touch you me
[55:10] and P are different
[55:13] amen amen amen everybody okay in the
[55:17] back amen we
[55:19] clear I want you to keep this in mind
[55:22] amen amen he says verse uh n there is no
[55:26] one greater in this house than I neither
[55:30] has he kept anything from me but who the
[55:33] the only thing P I say not this one it
[55:37] is only wife everything else Joseph you
[55:40] can go up in the refrigerator go do
[55:42] whatever you want to do in the
[55:43] refrigerator that's not my problem amen
[55:45] amen he say because you are his
[55:50] wife how then can I do this great
[55:54] wickedness and sin against
[55:58] God are we there amen verse 10 and it
[56:02] came to pass as she spoke to Joseph how
[56:06] day by day
[56:08] wow remember Samson
[56:12] fell I know what I'm
[56:15] saying DEA went day by day and Samson
[56:20] fell and Joseph also day by day but
[56:27] Joseph did not
[56:30] Fa Day by
[56:33] Day day by day like a daily
[56:40] bread amen amen amen a persistent woman
[56:45] amen amen day by day that he hearken not
[56:51] unto her to her to do what Lie by her to
[56:55] lie by by her or to be what with her in
[56:59] other word even if they say Joseph come
[57:00] and sit here sit closer
[57:04] here I don't want to do it because
[57:06] closer tomorrow is not going to be
[57:08] closer you're going to find yourself
[57:10] sitting
[57:14] somewhere even sitting closet no young
[57:19] people young man sitting Clos and
[57:22] no you a human being warm blooded
[57:27] I went through this in a hotel amen he
[57:30] say not sit by her or lie by her or to
[57:33] be with her verse 13 11 and it came to
[57:37] pass about this time that Joseph went
[57:39] into the house to do his business his
[57:43] work and there was none of the men of
[57:46] the house there inside she said okay
[57:49] this is a good trap let me take my
[57:52] opportunity and she caught him by His
[57:55] Garment very aggressive woman exactly
[57:59] is an aggressive woman is not good
[58:02] that's right that's
[58:05] right aggressive don't mean you have to
[58:08] only Touch by hand you can be aggressive
[58:11] in Behavior amen amen provoking
[58:17] amen amen amen he said and she CAU him
[58:20] by His Garment saying lie with me and he
[58:24] left his garment in her hand and did
[58:27] what and fled and got him what
[58:30] out and it came to pass when she saw
[58:33] that he had left His Garment in her hand
[58:36] and he was what fled forth let's stop
[58:39] right there keep that in mind day by day
[58:43] she did it she was the only one on top
[58:46] of Joseph so the top of Joseph is part
[58:50] and his wife are we clear a goodly young
[58:54] man are we clear amen now let's go to
[58:56] Genesis
[58:58] 41 verse

[59:08] where I'm going to stop I'm going to
[59:10] stop where the Holy Spirit want me to
[59:13] stop because if I try to download this
[59:16] it's not going to happen you will stay
[59:19] here
[59:20] longer amen amen so we stop where God
[59:23] want us to stop 41 amen
[59:26] verse 38 and Pharaoh said to his servant
[59:30] can we find such a one after he already
[59:33] unveiled the seals and broke all the
[59:36] symbols of the dream can we find anyone
[59:40] that is such as this one a
[59:44] man over
[59:48] whom in
[59:52] whom I'm just reading the Bible my
[59:54] friend is my Bible different than
[59:57] Amen in whom in whom today she's on fire
[1:00:03] Amen in whom Amen in whom the spirit of
[1:00:08] God is what is so according to Pharaoh
[1:00:12] the spirit of God is
[1:00:15] inside Joseph I'm reading the
[1:00:19] b a
[1:00:21] spirit of
[1:00:24] God is in
[1:00:26] is
[1:00:28] within inside of this man why look at
[1:00:32] what he did nobody was able to break the
[1:00:34] seals he came and broke the whole thing
[1:00:36] amen amen and Pharaoh said to Joseph for
[1:00:40] as much as God has showed you all this
[1:00:44] there is none so discreet and wise as
[1:00:48] you
[1:00:49] are no one like you you shall be over my
[1:00:54] house he be to remove
[1:00:57] everything whatever Pharaoh had
[1:00:59] jurisdiction he begin to take off his
[1:01:01] hand in other word I take off you take
[1:01:04] off take this take this take this
[1:01:07] because now I can rest amen amen
[1:01:12] amen amen now I found somebody that I
[1:01:16] can give confidence and then I can rest
[1:01:19] amen hallelujah I found somebody who's
[1:01:22] wiser than anyone am in Egypt because
[1:01:25] the spirit of the Lord is in
[1:01:27] him amen amen he said You shall be over
[1:01:31] my house and according to your
[1:01:35] word very carefully you taking over my
[1:01:40] house amen amen and according to your
[1:01:44] what
[1:01:46] word the voice of Joseph did not change
[1:01:52] no the peit of Joseph did not
[1:01:58] change so if Joseph speak he's still
[1:02:01] speaking the same way with the same
[1:02:04] voice and if you knew Joseph before you
[1:02:06] can tell that's Joseph speaking there
[1:02:09] but the problem is this time when he
[1:02:12] speak with the same voice amen amen amen
[1:02:18] things begin to move
[1:02:20] amen
[1:02:22] amen I don't know if you understanding
[1:02:25] amen when Joseph was going toward
[1:02:28] Pharaoh if Joseph say would you open the
[1:02:31] door please people are looking at
[1:02:34] him now who are you who you talking
[1:02:38] to amen but when he's coming out from
[1:02:42] Pharaoh with the same
[1:02:45] voice
[1:02:48] am that's why you don't have to change
[1:02:50] your voice when you praying for people
[1:02:53] amen amen amen amen the devil is not
[1:02:57] scared about how how how big your voice
[1:03:00] is amen hallu now devil come out come
[1:03:05] out that's not what take the devil out
[1:03:07] no it
[1:03:08] don't you might have a sister's
[1:03:12] voice but the devil need to know the
[1:03:16] authority behind your voice
[1:03:18] amen that is what moved the devil amen
[1:03:22] it is not the police
[1:03:24] officer it is who does the police
[1:03:27] officer mean what does he mean amen the
[1:03:31] police officer can be a
[1:03:33] woman which of course is a disgrace
[1:03:35] according to brother Bram but even if
[1:03:38] she's a disgrace if she stop you you're
[1:03:41] not going to move your
[1:03:42] car not because she's a woman because of
[1:03:45] the authority behind amen
[1:03:49] amen
[1:03:50] amen are we together are we together
[1:03:54] amen so Pharaoh say a according to your
[1:03:56] word so now when Joseph is coming up he
[1:04:00] say open the
[1:04:01] door even if he say open the
[1:04:06] door they're not going to do it like no
[1:04:12] quickly amen they don't care about the

[1:04:38] him hear your voice you say Satan get

[1:25:04] one is Coat of Many Colors we went
[1:25:08] through this number two is a coat of a
[1:25:12] servant this is where we are or a slave
[1:25:17] everybody okay number three is a coat of
[1:25:20] a
[1:25:21] prisoner we clear number four four is a
[1:25:25] code to
[1:25:27] appear before Pharaoh I'll give you all
[1:25:30] the scripture that's why I ask if you
[1:25:33] were up to date with the sermon amen and

[1:25:55] make way to the other coat amen One open
[1:26:00] up the way just like the caterpillar
[1:26:03] until you get to the butterfly you
[1:26:05] remember that amen amen and we found out
[1:26:08] that the one who sent Joseph to Egypt to
[1:26:12] become a slave is God Amen even though
[1:26:17] naturally speaking it looks like he was
[1:26:19] his brother but he was not his brother
[1:26:21] Joseph said you didn't send me there the
[1:26:24] one who sent me was God in other word
[1:26:27] the one who began the work
[1:26:32] amen the one who initiated the work amen
[1:26:36] the one who triggered the work the one
[1:26:39] who initiated the process is not
[1:26:44] Joseph he was not his brother he was God
[1:26:49] Amen in in other words the alpha of
[1:26:53] Joseph story is
[1:26:55] God and God never stop us the alpha when
[1:27:00] he is Alpha he must be also Omega when
[1:27:03] he is the a he must be also the Z amen
[1:27:06] and whenever God started something Paul
[1:27:10] says this in Philippian 1 verse 6 he
[1:27:14] said be confident of this very very
[1:27:18] thing be confident of what that he which
[1:27:22] has what begun a good work
[1:27:24] he didn't began a bad work no
[1:27:28] sir do you see my my screen whatever God

[1:27:35] because you were created for good work
[1:27:38] amen do you know that the Bible say in
[1:27:40] Ephesians 2 you were created for good
[1:27:43] work amen so whenever God started with
[1:27:46] you the devil can trouble you left and
[1:27:49] right but the day God will crank your
[1:27:52] engine
[1:27:53] [Applause]
[1:27:54] the day God will start his process his
[1:27:58] transforming process he's developing
[1:28:01] process in you Paul say be confidence in
[1:28:04] this amen hallelujah amen that the one
[1:28:09] who has begun a what a good work in in
[1:28:13] in you will do what perform it until the
[1:28:16] day of what of Jesus Christ so when God
[1:28:18] start with you he won't let you go no
[1:28:20] sir until the day you going to see Jesus
[1:28:23] amen
[1:28:25] in other words God won't
[1:28:27] quit even if you want to quit God
[1:28:30] doesn't quit amen wherever you go God
[1:28:33] will chase you down amen until you reach
[1:28:36] the day of redemption amen because it's
[1:28:39] not you who started the work it is not
[1:28:42] me who started the work it is not
[1:28:44] brother BR it is God Amen God doesn't
[1:28:47] start a job and stop in the middle way
[1:28:49] when God started he have to fulfill
[1:28:52] everything amen because he's a God of
[1:28:54] perfection
[1:28:57] amen Moses told him he said look if
[1:29:00] these people died in the wilderness do
[1:29:02] you know what they will say of you they
[1:29:04] will say you pull them in the I mean
[1:29:06] from Egypt to let them die over when God
[1:29:08] heard that he said I'm not going to kill
[1:29:10] them anymore I forgive them hey take the
[1:29:12] atonement go ahead and do this do this
[1:29:14] and I forgive Israel why because God
[1:29:17] when he started something am he will
[1:29:20] always finish it amen and when he
[1:29:23] started a good work good work and he
[1:29:25] will lead you to

[1:37:17] garment and Joseph went through five
[1:37:20] garment and Joseph being a top of the
[1:37:23] Lord Jesus Christ Jesus also must go
[1:37:26] through five garments amen and garments

[1:37:31] [Music]
[1:37:33] amen are we together are we together a
[1:37:37] government is a body whatever happened
[1:37:40] in Joseph was in the natural Jesus will
[1:37:43] do it in the spiritual amen are we
[1:37:46] together amen so quat number one because
[1:37:50] we going with the coat of many colors in
[1:37:52] the life of Jesus Christ
[1:37:54] brother Bram says this I mentioned this
[1:37:56] last Sunday that's all right who Joseph
[1:37:59] one of the patriarch saw down where into
[1:38:02] Egypt a perfect typ of who of Christ
[1:38:05] betrayed by who his Brethren sold for a
[1:38:08] few pieces of silver about 30 pieces
[1:38:11] about just like who Christ was he wore a
[1:38:14] coat of water of Many Colors as Christ
[1:38:17] was seen in Revelation one sitting on
[1:38:20] the throne with a what a rainbow over
[1:38:23] him if you go to the Book of Revelation
[1:38:25] you will see Jesus Christ with a rainbow
[1:38:28] of seven colors so Jesus Christ also
[1:38:31] have seven colors with him am he had a
[1:38:34] covenant with him in heaven amen and if
[1:38:37] you notice the coat of many color never
[1:38:39] made it to
[1:38:42] Egypt
[1:38:45] right amen am he stayed with the
[1:38:49] father do you remember he stayed with
[1:38:52] the father even when they took it away
[1:38:55] from Joseph they return it back to the
[1:38:57] father are we together so in heaven
[1:39:00] Jesus have a rainbow round about his
[1:39:03] glove round about his head a rainbow of
[1:39:07] seven colors so his position I with the
[1:39:11] father is where he have the cat of Many
[1:39:15] Colors amen do you follow me amen are
[1:39:18] you following me amen are you following
[1:39:20] me brother Bram say as Joseph had a coat
[1:39:22] of many
[1:39:24] he was a reflection of Jesus Christ in
[1:39:26] heaven with the father having also a
[1:39:30] rainbow of seven colors around his head
[1:39:34] amen because the seven color means
[1:39:36] Covenant amen like the rainbow thr fish
[1:39:39] which is a fish of a covenant amen but
[1:39:42] Jesus must leave this manle right here
[1:39:46] and come down into a mantle of a servant
[1:39:49] amen that's why God begin to condescend
[1:39:52] uh-huh
[1:39:53] God begin to come down from being
[1:39:57] Jehovah the word in the beginning was
[1:39:59] the word and the Word was with who God
[1:40:03] God the father but the word was made
[1:40:06] what flesh and dwell where Among Us so
[1:40:09] God must change court
[1:40:12] amen everybody okay Jesus must change
[1:40:16] garment Jesus have to move from the
[1:40:19] Heavenly garment into an Earthly garment
[1:40:22] but remember whenever Joseph was leaving
[1:40:26] his father
[1:40:27] Homeland which is the heaven for Jesus
[1:40:30] Christ coming into the Earth amen when
[1:40:33] Joseph was leaving Israel going into
[1:40:36] Egypt Joseph was
[1:40:39] despised wow Joseph was seen as a man
[1:40:44] below exactly and the Bible says in
[1:40:46] Isaiah 53 amen are we together have I
[1:40:51] lost somebody have i l
[1:40:54] the Bible say in Isaiah 53 that Jesus is
[1:40:57] what desp and what rejected of men a man
[1:41:01] of what sorrow and acquainted with what
[1:41:03] grief we did heed as he were our what
[1:41:07] faces from him so when you see Jesus
[1:41:09] chross you doing this when the Egyptians
[1:41:11] see Joseph coming up they say it's a
[1:41:13] Hebrew get away from him Joseph is a
[1:41:16] perfect to of Jesus Christ amen are we
[1:41:20] together he was a Ste we he our faed for
[1:41:22] him he was what and we esteem what him
[1:41:26] not he was not esteemed just as Joseph
[1:41:29] was not esteemed going to
[1:41:32] Egypt have I lost somebody have I lost
[1:41:36] somebody he was a steam not he left
[1:41:40] Heaven coming down to the earth Isaiah
[1:41:42] said this man will be despised this man
[1:41:46] will not be esteem this man will be
[1:41:49] rejected why because he's changing the
[1:41:52] coat he left all the glory that he had
[1:41:55] in heaven and he became a human being
[1:41:59] and that's what Matthew says this we
[1:42:01] explained to you last Sunday in Matthew
[1:42:04] 12:18 behold my what my servants Jesus
[1:42:07] Christ becoming a servant to Jehovah
[1:42:10] behold my servant whom I have what I
[1:42:12] have chosen my who my beloved in whom my
[1:42:15] soul is what well pleased I will put my
[1:42:18] spirit where upon him and he shall show
[1:42:20] judgment to the water the Gentiles what
[1:42:22] I want you to notice he is Jesus become
[1:42:25] a servant amen amen everybody okay he
[1:42:29] left from Heaven coming down to the
[1:42:31] earth when he come down to the Earth
[1:42:33] he's no longer what you saw him in
[1:42:35] heaven he become now a servant a servant
[1:42:39] that is despised of man rejected of man
[1:42:43] a man of sorrow acquainted with grief
[1:42:46] and we esteem him not the same process
[1:42:49] that happened to Joseph everybody clear
[1:42:52] so far and servant meant have something
[1:42:56] my friend in Hebrew 2 verse 16 the Bible
[1:43:00] says this for verily he took not on him
[1:43:03] the what nature of angels He was no
[1:43:06] longer an angel but he took on him the
[1:43:08] seed of what Abraham because he become a
[1:43:10] human being wherefore in all things he
[1:43:14] beho him that he be made like what unto
[1:43:17] his Brethren so when Jesus Christ left
[1:43:19] his deity in heaven and coming down into
[1:43:23] to the Earth he become like one of us
[1:43:26] am everybody okay he also become a
[1:43:29] servant to Jehovah just like you are a
[1:43:32] servant to Jehovah and the Bible say he
[1:43:34] beho in other word he was
[1:43:37] important for Jesus to become
[1:43:41] L it was important for Jesus to become a
[1:43:45] servant to become like a slave it's
[1:43:48] important he beh him to be made like
[1:43:51] unto what his bre why that he might be
[1:43:54] what a merciful and what and faithful
[1:43:57] high priest in the things pertaining to

[1:44:11] amen come Lord everybody okay everybody
[1:44:15] okay can I say something can I say
[1:44:18] something let's stay focused can I say
[1:44:20] something before I become a doctor a
[1:44:24] dentist I was a dentist
[1:44:28] assistant for years and I work with a
[1:44:32] dentist amen and I seen how dentist and
[1:44:36] doctor treat
[1:44:39] people do you follow me and because of

[1:44:47] a doctor I will never treat my staff the
[1:44:52] way they are treat treated by other
[1:44:54] people because now I understand what
[1:44:57] assistant understand amen a man who goes
[1:45:01] directly to medical school will never
[1:45:04] understand a nurse but somebody who was
[1:45:07] a nurse before and become a doctor will
[1:45:11] respect the nurse more amen because he
[1:45:13] can feel amen he can enter in we can be
[1:45:19] compassionate he can understand the
[1:45:22] stress that the nurse goes through
[1:45:25] amen it is important for a boss to do
[1:45:29] the work that you're
[1:45:31] doing because he will understand the
[1:45:34] pressure amen because he himself went
[1:45:36] through that pressure Joseph was a
[1:45:39] servant himself he would know how to
[1:45:42] rule Egypt amen and make people
[1:45:44] comfortable because he know what a slave
[1:45:47] is like
[1:45:51] [Music]
[1:45:53] if Jesus remain Jesus Christ if God
[1:45:56] remain God he will not understand your
[1:45:59] pain amen he won't understand your
[1:46:02] headache amen he won't understand your

[1:46:57] was a human being a God that knows what
