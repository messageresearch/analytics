this morning lord as you did with john lord we thank you father we thank you for your presence hallelujah i do not have any praise reports unless anybody has one that they would like to speak out this morning amen yes sir what you got brother was it last monday uh brother robert and i were at the church uh working and uh i was up front there toward the platform that little door there i was working out that back door and there's a step there that brother robert built that has to pull out so they can get up under the platform there and i was putting baseboard in and right there where that step is uh that baseboard it can't be attached to the wall so so it has to come out so that step can come out so i was out back there working and what i had to do was make an l-shaped piece of trim there and so i was i was putting them together and uh and i don't know what happened the uh the gun it's it was a trim nailer with 80 pounds of pressure behind it the gun slipped off of the wood and it hit my leg right here and when those when those go off there's a nail coming out and i felt it but it didn't hurt and so i went on working and sometime later i went back to brother robert and told him what what had happened and and we prayed there and he took me to the urgent care and he just looked at it and i mean there was a there was blood there a little spot of blood and but it didn't hurt you know so we went back and kept working and then i went home and my wife asked me if i was going to the er i said no because it doesn't hurt well brother stephen called me late that night and he persuaded me to go to the er which i did and they took pictures of it and there was nothing there um so yesterday i'm back down here at the church working on that same at back out that back door there and finishing up what i started and i looked down and this nail is laying on the step i'm thinking well how in the world did that get there one single nail and i don't like to say i don't know what happened i just know that gun slipped off the off that wood hit me in the leg i felt it hit and i have no clue you know all i can say is just the lord just and then yesterday when i found that nail laying there i'm thinking somehow the lord just caused that nail to do something so hallelujah hey man it happened with a bullet in that and wasn't there a story about a bullet that came through the window and hit a woman in uh in service just bounced off of her if he can do it with a bullet he can do it with a nail with 80 pounds of pressure on it i've known people that you know the gun goes off on top of a roof and hits somebody on the ground and goes in it went in this one guy's head that i know so there's a lot of pressure there dangerous we'll praise god anybody else have a praise report this morning amen i'll go to the prayer request um i've got a couple actually um myself for prayer requests i had um one of my co-workers texted me and um we got a little three-way chat we don't we don't actually work together anymore but we keep in touch and um one of them had mentioned something about um a post that somebody had made about cancer one of our ex-co-workers and uh come to find out that um i've worked with him off and on for years his mom has been diagnosed with cancer and his uncle and he's just you know upset about it which is you know so i told i told the other brother get his name and um or get the names of the people his mom's name is gloria and his uncle's name is roger and then i would bring it up here at church you know ask the lord to have mercy on them with the cancer this morning and um also i would like for y'all to remember me from my back my back's giving me trouble this morning i'm in a position now where i do quite a bit of shoveling at work and um i don't know i don't know if it's just got to me this week or whatever because it happens i shovel a lot but you know it's it's just every once while i'll move and it'll grab me just on the right side so if y'all can just um you know just remember yes ma'am my mother about two years ago has shingles but she didn't know what it was so it took her a while before she actually told my sisters that she was having pain over here on the side and they took her to the doctor she's been in pain ever since she has seen already all these doctors and specialists acupuncture massage therapy and everything there is nothing else we can do but just ask god because um two years is a long time to suffer from shingles they actually came over one time her and her her dad came over back in about 96 and uh we were attending now ravens church then we took them to the river baptized them in the name of the lord jesus and they were you know believing the message she said she did a lot of witnessing down there so we you know but god said those that you love and those that love you waited too so that if she would have identified that she would right away she would have gotten help but she waited too long and therefore made it home in an earth amen anybody else have a prayer request this morning i'm gonna ask brother charles senior if he would mind coming up this morning i do have a couple of announcements god bless you my brother let us pray heavenly father we thank you lord jesus christ for allowing us lord god to wake up in our right minds lord jesus too come into your courts lord jesus christ with thanksgiving and praise heaven and father lord god we thank you for meeting us here lord jesus and father we come here to hear from you lord god lord we come here father to rejoice in the spirit of

heavenly father that nothing can hinder the movement of your spirit lord god to each and every individual lord god that is standing in hand that is standing in need lord god father we pray for those lord god that have been afflicted lord the demon of cancer heavenly father lord it is nothing for you lord god the finger of god can cast that can cast that spirit away lord god [Music] but father we

that your grace lord and your mercy heavenly father lord just lord you come down heavenly father and blanket them with comfort lord god blanket them lord god with compassion lord god blanket them lord with the healing that they have need of lord jesus christ because lord that when it's time for us to pray lord god that back pain lord god we just can't settle in the spirit lord god because lord the

but a saint who's been washed white as snow it's not by anything you've done but by the blood of god's own son when you're washed by the water [Applause] by the water of the world it's like being born

question box is still there i hope everybody is moving forward with their cod amen because we're gonna leave the bottom of the ocean sooner and we're going up so if you're behind we're gonna soar like ego amen make sure you are not behind on one sermon amen we're gonna be entering the second banquet lord's willing i will see how we're gonna work today and see if i can pick up menopause on wednesday and then we can enter the second banquet on sunday if everything goes well amen so if you have a chance during this week go back and listen to part one just part one king i had seriously on part 44 so go back to part one i just want you to grab something there so it's gonna make it easier because there is a setting there on esther chapter eight that you need to understand part one then it's gonna help you flow easily amen you get a chance just go back to part one it's speaking about the first feast and the second feast of king ahazard get the setting pretty good then we're gonna flow easily amen i believe we got everything in place so let's go back to the scripture amen blessed be the name of the lord god always make a way if you don't believe in the god of miracle you cannot live in this world anymore everything is chaos and thank god to the god that can give us peace in the midst of all the chaos no matter what is going on we still find by god's grace amen let's go to the book of psalms 45 i wanted to go up and there was something that needed to be checked we need to check something make sure the seat belts are tired back up pretty good then we're going to go back up amen if you're struggling with any of these things we've been laboring on and he have not leave you you need to contact the deacon you got to lay everything at the bottom of the ocean and be free we can go up with a lot of weight amen make sure whatever was bothering you is left at the bottom of the ocean in the midnight zone let's go back up because when we're gonna soar i don't know whether i promise you about predestination but i'm looking at the two pillars of the temple of salomon there is a mystery to that so make sure you finish here then we're gonna soar psalm chapter 45. i know somebody will go back to the scripture what are they what are they psalm 45 if you there you can say amen verse 9 king's daughters were among your honorable women you might be sitting so the daughters of the king are not filthy they are honorable they need to be treated with respect we went through all of this when we explained you the way the woman was created and how much respect and honor should be given to her not treating her like a devil but you're treating her like a son of god so king's daughter were among your honorable women upon your right hand did stand who the queen the bride in gold of offer so david right here is saying that there is a bride that is sitting beside the king and that bride as she sits her clothing the clothing of the blood or the clothing of the queen is made out of water and god speak of water so when you look at the clothing of this woman he all speak about the deity of god can your club give an information like that one when somebody look at you dress and they look at you they say this look like a child of the king [Music] amen the clothing of the queen is in god of offer verse 10 hearken or daughter and consider and incline your ear forget also your own people because you came from a strange land and your father's house if you remember when we spoke about the woman when israel went to war and they want to get a woman she have to shave her head and she have to mourn for her father's house you got to forget the first house completely off because we were born into the world you got to forget that first house completely amen forget also your own people the people that used to be your friend those that used to hang out with you in the nightclub smoking weed and every kind of things forget your own people forget your father's house so shall the king greatly desire your water god is not interested in the beauty of the world god wants you to be separated first from the world then you're going to receive a second beauty and that beauty is what god is going to desire to heaven a bread without spot and water winkle everybody clear so shall the king greatly desire your beauty so if there is no separation with your own people there is no separation with your first house your father's house then god will not greatly desire you verse 11 so shall the king desire greatly desire your beauty for he is your lord he is your honor remember sarah say my lord my owner he is your honor he's the one that pays the price of redemption he's the one that claimed you that redeem you by going all the way to the cross and die the death of the cross to redeem you so he owns you he's your lord amen for he is your lord and worship you him verse 12 and the daughter of time shall be there with a gift even the rich among the people shall entreat your favor everybody will be looking for you people would give you stuff for some reason if you don't believe it sit with me i'm gonna give you testimony after testimony after testimony amen my wife wanted to do her braiding in uh in somebody else's place and her car was so dirty and she left the car on outside they were braiding my daughter's head of hair on the inside when my wife left the young people in the house by themselves went outside and washed my cars for free [Music] i can give you testimony of the testimony after testimony just like that amen so the daughter of tyre shall be there with a gift even the rich among the people shall entreat your favor people will be looking at you because you got something special that can help them verse 13 the king's daughter is all water glorious where we know that when we spoke about the black dog and a white dog that we have two parts we have the inner being everybody there the inner man or the inward man that the scripture called and we have the outer man amen by the scripture david says that the daughter of the king will be glory as well within in her heart she'll be all glorious and the condition of the heart is going to be reflected upon the assad because the prostitute in proverbs 7 if you remember she looks like a harlot and her heart was also saddled so the heart was reflected on the outside verse 13 the king's daughter is all glorious way weaving on the inside in the heart her water so the condition of the heart influenced the the clothing the condition of the heart had an impact on the clothing so if the clothing is wrong sometime check all righty somebody say it for her clothing is of rotten water the queen have the clothing of gold so on the inside her heart is glorious and that glory is expressed on the outside by gold so the beauty of the inside is a divine beauty a deity beauty and that beauty expressed itself on the outside because in the garden of eden in genesis 3 when man sin in the garden of eden god pick up a lamb and cloth his children with the lamb amen so on the outside when they look at the children of god and adam and eve all you can see is an expression of a bleeding lamb a bleeding word a bleeding lamb a bleeding word which was speaking of christ himself verse 13 again the king's daughter is all glorious within her clothing is of rot gold on the outside about clear verse 14 she shall be brought to the king in remnant of neil the work the virgins her companion that follow her shall be brought to you verse 15 with gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought they shall enter into the king water because the king is delighting on the queen let's go to zephaniah chapter one again we read it last week we're going to read it again unless your boss tell me something if we finish here then we go back up to the surface amen zephaniah chapter 1 verse 7. you go to daniel then you begin to go slowly 35 miles an hour you're going to see zephaniah after daniel then you're going to see the ammos or somebody slowly zephaniah chapter 1 verse 7 hold your peace at the presence of the lord for the day of the lord is at hand for the lord had prepared a sacrifice i explained to you last week he has beat his guests and it shall come to pass in the day of the lord's sacrifice when god is coming to destroy everything that i will punish the princes and the king's children and all such as our clothes with water when your clothing are not good you are doomed for destruction because your clothing is an expression of your [Music] amen so decent time there is a destruction coming up in order to avoid the destruction you must be connected to malachi 4 because malachi 4 was sent to return the water everybody you need the ministry of malachi 4 to prepare your heart because once your heart is prepared then automatically your clothing will be affected because your outside is only an expression of your inside let's go to john chapter 15 [Music] hallelujah john chapter 15 verse 26 very familiar scripture but when the comforter the holy ghost is come whom i shall send to you from the father even the spirit of water the spirit of truth jesus said i am the truth the spirit of christ in other words the spirit that was in jesus even the spirit of truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of who of christ let's go to chapter 16 verse 13. if you there you can say amen however when he the spirit of truth is come he will do water he will guide you in all water so you need the holy ghost in your life to guide you we can teach you the word but it will take the holy spirit to guide this inner old man amen and he's going to guide you in all truth and the truth is the word because jesus said my word our truth anybody clear verse 13 however when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself you can give me a lord be brother david but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to water it's also a spirit of prophecy anybody clear now let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace for your love for your mercy your blessings and everything you have been doing in our life father this is as far as i can go as a human being but lord we are depending completely and always on the holy spirit to come lord and minister to your children father we are committing this service unto the hand may you move me completely out of the way may you come again once again and speak to your children lord may the devil and all his army be completely sealed out but may the holy spirit only and the angel of the lord father come and speak directly to the heart of your children as we committed all unto the hand in the name of jesus christ amen praise be the name of the lord we are on part 44 we're gonna head to the airport sooner king hazares three fists and esther three blanket we spoke about the first feast of king of hazarus we spoke about the second feast of king ahazaris we also talk about the third fist and the first banquet and between the first banquet of esther toward the second as a banquet of esther we had a stop from the holy spirit to go down into some territory to make sure our life clean up before we move into the depths of the world amen we present it to you and we discuss with you about the women cutting the hair in this church we talk to you about smoking what he does to your body we talk to you about drinking what it does to your body we talk to you about women that's what the angel of the lord told brother branham do not smoke do not drink and do not defy your body with women we talk to you about drugs marijuana cocaine all those kind of stuff we talk to you about the painting the makeup of the women the lipstick we talk to you about the nail we talk to you about the painting of the eyes the painting of the face we talk to you about the jewelry the earring we talked to you also about the nails we also went further and we explained to you about the nail that the sister in the message have a tendency to do we discuss with you about boys men who were the bengals or the bracelet we told you that that was wrong for a boy we also discussed with you between the two banquets about the type of love we talked to you about agape love about filial love about the lustful love and the filthy love we talk to you about christmas why christmas was wrong according to the scripture and according to the word to the message of the hour we talk to you about the easter tradition of banis easter on itself is good but the tradition around easter the bunny and the eggs we explain to you that all was a trait of hedonism we talked to you about the god of variety that god created you according to a certain category whether you're a black man you're a white man you're a hispanic or you an indian it's god that created you that way you should appreciate god the way he created you and you stay in your category and you'll be proud of the way god created you we talk to you and explain to you about mixed marriages on that we talk to you about how we should conduct in our home what is the responsibility of a woman what is the responsibility of a man as the head of the household and what are the responsibility of a man in a marriage we talk to you about your friendship who should be your friend who you should be associated with we talked to you last week about the high heel and the impact of the high heel on your body we talk to you about the tight dressing and the way the dresses are feeding the form-feeding dresses that exposes the body that was supposed to be concealed or to be covered all of this and the other one that we discussed were completely the territory of the black dog in roman chapter 1 verse 8 paul says that first i thank my god through jesus christ for you all why paul do you thank god for the roman christian he says that your faith everybody clear your faith what you believe your foundation what you are standing for your belief your religion if i can call it that way your christianity because there is many kind of christianity amen your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world so there was something about the christian in rome that their faith in god was influencing everybody all over the world amen in second corinthians chapter three verse two paul says that ye are our written epistle how did you wrote a paul in our heart known and read of all men amen for as much as he had manifestly declared to be the epistle of water of who christ ministered by who so paul preached the word of god paul preached christ or the message of his death to the people and the people paul was preaching to took the sermon of paul and begin to leave the sermon of paul until people that didn't have a chance to read the bible all people that never came in contact with paul all people that never came in contact with the message of can look through the christians that listen to paul and they can see exactly what god was speaking through the edge paul says that he are manifestly declared to be the epistle of christ minister by eyes we are channels that the lord have used written not with ink but with water the spirit of the living god in other words the holy spirit by bringing his word to the church that word of the holy spirit was going in the inside heart of the people and once the word whatever happened in the subconscious in your heart automatically will be displayed on the outside and when the world begin to be displayed in the life of the children of god then the children of god became living a peaceful that's why brother branham said that the two spies that went and talked to rehab were taps it is not that in jericho they had a player but those spies repeated exactly what joshua said until if you listen to them you will think it's joshua who's talking amen that's the kind of ministry we wanted amen he said written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in a table of stone like in the old testament but in the fleshly table of your water in the message communion brother branham say you know you are part of this gospel you are written epistle of what we are water or preaching and as long as we do something that is reproachful then we are indebted to what we are listening to everybody if preach you something and then after you already receive the knowledge of what god already told you if you do something contrary to what you have been taught then you are causing problem to the kingdom of god let's go to james chapter one hallelujah you learn a lot so we need to tweak something a little bit before we go up james chapter one if you dare you can say amen james chapter 1 verse 21 wherefore pages are turning james chapter one he comes after hebrew wherefore lay a part of fifiness and superfluity of naughtiness all this territory of the black dog lay them as part lay them assad and receive with meekness the water engrafted word everybody clear engrafted word it's a word that when it comes in your heart it's going to write something it's going to imprint something into your heart it's going to leave a mark in your heart amen it's a living word receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your brain you see where is saving your heart which is able to save your soul but be you doers of the world even though you receive the word don't stop them amen that word must become life in other words you must leave what they preach you [Music] ever clear we didn't preach you to feel your brain we preach to you so that you can live it and when you leave it you become a living bible [Music] ever clear but be your duels of the world and not water hears only deceiving your own water so when you listen to the message and you don't do what the words say you are deceiving not the pastor not the deaconer not your wife not your husband it's an individual affair you are deceiving yourself hallelujah verse 22 23 for if any be a healer of the word and not a doer he's like a man beholding his natural face in a glass for he behold himself he sees himself and goes his way and immediately forget what kind of man he was if you look at gems here james says that when you listen to the word of god amen it's like you are standing in front of a mirror because the word is the mirror the word is what is gonna tell you how you look before you go on the outside are you following me and james says that when you are listening to the word of god the one you see in the mirror is not your neighbor are you following me so when you come to church when they begin to preach the word of god don't be thinking about the next person beside you don't be thinking about somebody else's wife don't be thinking about somebody else's husband don't be thinking about somebody else's children look at yourself the world is talking to you [Applause] how can you look in the mirror instead of seeing myself as ibrahid elijah something is wrong [Music] everybody here that's why we don't pay attention to our life and we pay attention to everybody else's life in the message while the message come to you i will send you elijah the [Applause] prophet if they don't believe it that's not your problem focus on your life look at yourself and how can you look in the mirror and you go out and you forget because the mirror already told you the present state of your life are you there when you walk up you take a shower what you see in the mirror is the you of today not of yesterday everybody here if yesterday you heard something and you change it the mirror today will tell you exactly what to change before you go to the public right back here verse 25 but whoso looks into the water the perfect law of water so when the word of god comes to your life the world is coming to liberate you [Music] the world is coming to free you the displaying and the explanation of the black dog territory was not to bury you god came to expose you what you are struggling with so that you can be free from your life in the perfect love of liberty the liberties in that law in the world and continue therein and you stay with it not only you look you see and then you go you forgot when you see it you must stay with that vision and continue there it in other words we meant doing he being not a forgetful here but a door of the water work this man shall be water in his water you want to be blessed in your life when you listen to the word of god begin to apply that word to your life and the spirit always follow the word and god will bless you in everything that you do that's why god told joshua depart not from the law so that you might be prosperous in everything that you do everybody clear so far so brother brother say as long as hallelujah by the bottom say as long as we do something that is reproachful then we are indebted to what we are listening to god will require of you at first you didn't know now you know we must live what we believe and leave it in such a way that it will never reproach but reflect who jesus christ in all things that we do and what that's where it is in other words when we are preaching the gospel in this church when you go outside your life and your behavior and your conversation should reflect exactly what you've been preached here hallelujah a total deliverance brother brown i'm saying the member of the church he is called to be a member of this certain group that he will not compromise if the church believes that we should not gamble then that member should never touch water if your church believes that we don't smoke if your church does not believe in high heels if your church does not believe in makeup if your church does not believe in women cutting the hell then you make sure in your life at home you don't do what you already been told [Music] we don't believe in drinking he the member of that church should turn his head completely from drinking if we do not believe in gambling or smoking the member of this church should never touch such a thing god gives complete deliverance he will do it if we shall completely surrender ourselves to him if we will completely deliver ourself into his hand then god can live in us christ the hope of glory he can reflect himself from us as we get ourself out as you put your car in your chair and you let god do the work and you just surrender your life and your self-will you say father they preach about it i'm struggling with it it is hard for me but i'm accepting your word and i'm i'm willingly delivering myself into your hand if you humble yourself before the word then the holy spirit will take over then it's not gonna be you doing the work but it's gonna be god in you doing the work and when it's god in you doing the work then automatically it's going to be reflected into the outside by grace are you water not of your work but it's a water a gift of god ever clear then our thoughts are his thoughts you want to get to the teleport could you imagine cross smoking a cigar could you imagine christ drinking playing card then if your spirit is part of his spirit he wants it to be upon your water but you permit the devil to come in and take over and all the time in your heart way down deep you know you are wrong when you do those things amen inside your heart you know what they're preaching is the truth and brother branham said the reason why you don't want to do it is you have not surrendered yet you are allowing the devil to come into you don't blame anybody blame yourself for allowing the devil you can just live with somebody so long and around them until you take up their ways if you live with somebody so long brother branham said automatically you're going to pick up the ways how can you live so long in the presence of the word the living person of christ and you don't pick up his ways hallelujah and it's good for us not to run off and live with the world but stay with jesus until we can water we fled his life his life be reflected in our life and that's the way those disciples were they knew that they had been around jesus because they talked like him they acted like him they healed like him and every answer was like who they was inspired like him and they know that he was living in water so there was something about the believer that the people who never had an experience with jesus christ when they contact you they can have a feeling how jesus behaved they can have a feeling how jesus talk they can have a feeling how jesus react they can have a feeling how jesus responds because christ is living in your life and he's displaying himself through you ever clear that is what we should be all the time as believer they acting like him because if you associate with someone so long guess what you got to pick up his behavior everybody clear so far praise be the name of the lord why then we never know just what we are doing what influence what we are doing is having upon others the bible said we are written epistle read of all men that is your life read solo to the public until your testimony if it's contrary to your life is without any water it is absolutely impossible for you to go through a lot of teaching and deep teaching and not reflecting that in your life there is a blockage somewhere amendment it is what you are inside of you that people read how do people read your insider nobody knows what is in the mind save the spirit which is in a man but for people to reach your inside your inside is reflected on the outside by your life [Music] hallelujah not so much what you say but what you are you can pin something on somebody say this is that and so forth but your life being different from what they say your testimony of your life is louder than the testimony that someone could say something about you in other words if somebody gossip about you you don't have to worry about it that's why brother branham said jesus was unconscious of criticism amen the main thing is make sure your life is zeroed in with the word and the testimony of your life will fight everybody that is gossiping about you if somebody say you stole or you were fifa and the day they come closer to you and they see your life and the way they behave you don't have to tell them anything you will hear them giving you a testimony that we heard people were talking like this and this but when i see you i don't see that you're not gonna fight they're the one that gonna go back to those people and say what you told us about that brother is wrong why do you fight amen amen so just keep that on your mind that we are bringing influences every day and the life that you live prove what is on the inside of you you cannot change that it reflects every person reflects outside what is water every person ever here because amen mordecai which is a type of brother branham stood against him that is good the first pool stood against him and that is good the second pool stood against him and that weakened him but still on the first banquet hammond was still there and being there happy but something must be done to destroy that amen to the pentecostal church of this day the restoration of the gift may lord those men maybe some of them present here some of them hearing the tape around the world made the realize that this is the calling out of the bottom not a pentecostal message the pentecostal message was to restore the gift back to the church but this is the calling forth of the blood another message that was to come just before sodom was to be burned distraction let them understand dear god amen you are not called to leave the pentecostal message but you are called to leave a message higher than that [Music] everybody clear because that's the only way that you can destroy that man and they're going to cover a face his face which we're going to see later on in 1st timothy chapter 2 paul says this that in like manner also that women not girl adorned themselves in modest apparel with shamefulness because we know the prostitute is never ashamed amen so that's why the sister gotta have that with shame fitness and sobriety not with breaded hair or gold or peril or cossiere we explain to you that brother branham told us that all those stuff was for the prostitute of the time of paul in other words the message here is don't dress like the women of the world that's what paul was saying amen dress differently than the people of the world but which becoming women professing godliness with good work so what paul is saying here we have paul and we have peter paul is saying that there are women that are professing goldiness when you meet them they're going to tell you i'm a christian they will explain to you they will express to you that i believe the message i'm a christian now what paul is saying here is if you are confessing that you a christian you also must dress like a christian another one paul is talking about the outside appearance everybody the way you confess all the way you profess is the way you should look on the outside make sense which becometh to women professing godliness with good work let the woman learn in silence with our subjection but i suffer not the woman to do what to teach not to do water absorb authority over a man if you look at paul he's using two words number one paul is saying i suffered not a woman to teach number two paul is saying i suffer her to do what not to observe authority what is paul talking about in the garden of heaven when god created the men and a woman men and women were equal [Music] about him according to the first covenant men and women were both equal and one man and a woman were equal eve taught adam i already explained that are you following me when eve taught adam he calls a chaos when sarah taught abraham he caused a curse so paul is reminding us that when a woman and the men were under the first covenant amen eve taught and caused trouble because she didn't understand the way she was created ever ever clear amen i don't want you to repeat that again because in christ we are not male no female but remember don't let the women preach [Music] you follow me come on you follow me teach no to do what for you to observe authority you must be under authority you okay in other words paul moved from the first covenant into the second covenant where god says that the man shall rule over the woman and paul say in the first covenant even on the second covenant the woman should not take the pulpit i do not tell her to observe authority why because she's already under the second covenant i suffer not the woman to teach not to observe authority of a man but to be in water for adam was first formed paul said go back to the garden of eden the trail of the serpent was hidden right there are you there go back to the garden of eden adam was first from then who and adam was not deceived in other words remember what happened in the garden of eden amen i'm not telling you this just because i want to tell you but i'm telling you in reference to what happened in eden because in needham adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the water notwithstanding she shall be saved in water he was formed it was the woman deceived but she shall be saved in what in child bearing white child bearing because when the curse came on the woman not only was she put under men for protection but god gave the problem on the conception that's why paul keep the line so when you read the scripture you need a prophet amen an adam was not deceived by the woman being deceived was in a transgression notwithstanding she shall be saved in water i'm going i'm putting the woman back again to the position that god put her in the garden of eden in shortbearing if they continue in the water and charity and holiness with what sobriety that was paul watch peter now peter say likewise you wife be in subjection to your own husband same thing paul said that if any obey not they also may without the word be warned by the conversation of the wives why the behold your chest conversation if you look in here he's talking about the life couple we feel who's adorning let it be not let it not be that outward adorning of playing of the air and wearing of gold and putting on off water but let it be off the water paul was talking about the outside appearance about what you confess what you profess you must look like that but now when peter comes peter is talking about the inside man anybody here one is talking about the appearance that somebody see another one put the accent not on the appearance but peter is telling you that the beginning is in the heart paul is saying fix your outside peter say before you get on the outside start first from the inside he said who's adorning let it be not on the outward that's what paul was talking about i don't think of the planning of her or the wearing of god or the putting on of her peril but in that which is not water in other words peter is not focusing on this i'm focusing on the character even the ornament of a milk and a quiet water in the heart the meek is the lamb which is in the sight of god of a great person for after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted in god i don't themself being in what suggestion unto their own they always kept their place of protection because god gave a woman to be under a man not for abuse but for protection but the main thing peter is saying watch the inside work on the inside more than anything paul say work on the outside because the inside the outside always reflect the inside you got the two of them where are you going now praise be the name of the lord now let's sword hallelujah i always have been accused of being hard on a sister about wearing barber and manicure all over their face and stuff i have always been accused of being hard honest our sisters it is not that i got anything against that i don't say the woman is not a good woman that she's some street walker or something that is not my attitude but it is this when she puts so much artificial on the outside it shows that there is a lot artificial on water inside where he o ought to be filled up with what with christ because the outside always express what is water by the fruit you know them that's exactly what i have been saying here all along everybody clear so far we found many women in these days thirst for beauty it's a natural thing for a woman to test to be pretty that is her god give an instinct her beauty that god gave her for her mate and now we found out that women want to be that way why is it it's just because it's something god gave her it is not wrong for a woman to be pretty there should be now the true touch that a woman should have paul now peter the true touch that a woman should have will be to adorn themselves in modest apparel and have water while the problem say what a woman need is to help paul and peter together you follow me now adorned themselves with a modest apparel power but to have a christ-like spirit peter in other words combine paul and peter first timothy 2 9 da now that is the way the woman should touch to be now if you want to be pretty that's the way what makes you pray see it is a water a christ-like spirit peter and i'm done in water go by peter first then you can get paul if you get paul first you under legalistic are you there if you fix your outside clothing without fixing your heart you're gonna leave a hard battle and you're gonna wait for somebody to get you off the message because you have been living in a prison you are trying to block the black dog and it never work so when a preacher comes and free you automatically you go back to the mire that you came out of it because you try to go by paul without peter you go by peter first you fix your heart then you don't have to worry about paul [Music] anybody clear so far we talk about the women wearing high heels we talked about the women wearing tight clothes that what that expresses their their form what about the skirt hallelujah the most ungodly thing trying to advertise skirt for women say show every move of their body god making a woman such as i think that she is a woman is not a law creature remember that we already explained you that and who degrade her mind when god put a sheepskin over remember genesis to do what to hide her so the covering of the lamb was to conceal or to hide you already know that and she wanted a knitted dress to show every form of her body now ladies i want you to forgive me i don't want to hurt your feeling i'm not here to hurt your feeling god knows it's not but i'm here as a gospel preacher to let you know what is truth then you do it whatever you wish to then when you got to doing those things you shall be you shall begin to reason if this woman can do it she is a well thought of she goes to church she lives in the rank of society why can't i do it that's reasoning when your soul tells you it is water so regardless of whose sister is doing what you stay with the world everybody clear god cover women up and man up not only women and men up in the garden of eden we already went there never strip them see but it is reasoning you shall reason it out the rest of them are doing it where are we getting it okay in darkest south africa when i see women standing there stark naked as they came into the world and when the holy spirit came on them there to hide the water they folded the water and walked away till they could find some water brother branham was preaching and the women were bare chested and when the holy spirit came down automatically the women folded their arm and they ran away to get clothing so if you have a problem covering your chest you need to go back to the altar i'm not dealing with the chest you already know you gotta cover it and then they call us the civilization and each year we are taking off more clothes and then claim to have the holy spirit the holy spirit will work on one person one way and on another another way if the holy spirit comes on you whether you are black or white whether you are chinese or whichever category you wonder you want to behave the same [Applause] [Music] hallelujah we understand brother stephen we gotta cover our top we understand brother stephen we have to avoid clothes that are tied to our body that is expressing the form of our body the shape of our body we must stick to avoid that what about the skirt should i wear a long skirt like that who want to preach now oh should i wear a long shirt a skirt like that well pastor i don't see anything wrong with this [Laughter] blessed be the name of the lord it's going so fast there i'm not at the airport yet gps recovery break everybody clear oh pastor i must be wearing a skirt like that i don't think so pastor maybe need to be like that a little bit longer you know what maybe this way it's normal well i have also another question pastor what about our sleeves is that bad that's bad sister i believe your sleep should be full no that's too much maybe i believe it should be in the middle of the road pastor retired just give us a measurement rather branham say then that will take care of it where should we be that's your last tweak before we go up everybody clear let's go with brother branham number one it's a hot potato right go ahead brother stephen go ahead i have been waiting for this i understand the high heel already i suffer with this yes we don't know some people say long something so so so who's going to determine exodus chapter 19 verse 4 you have seen what i did unto the egyptian now titan up how i bury you on eagle's wings we already know it's a prophet and brought you unto myself now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed and keep my covenant then you shall be a water a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the earth is mine and you shall be unto me a kingdom of water when god called you to this gospel you follow me i want you to relax now you ready god purpose was always for his people to be priests amen israel went too far and too quick and god have to introduce the law and give them the levitical pursuit but right in exodus when god was pulling israel out of the egypt here he intended not only for the tribe of liver to be priests but god wants our israel you follow me all israel men and women [Music] to be priests not only the child of liver liver was given as a substitute because the law was a school master it was a temporary thing but god wanted the entire kingdom to be preached hallelujah you shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and not only a kingdom of priest but god wanted you to be water a holy nation so holiness god didn't want holiness to be only to the tribe of liver god didn't want the preacher to live a clean life only god wanted the entire congregation to live a clean life [Music] if the people repent preacher need to repent [Music] hallelujah these are the word which you shall speak unto the children of israel in titus 2 verse 13 and 14 in the new testament looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great god and our welcome deity rather the what great god who's that great god jesus and god are the great god and our savior jesus christ who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity come out and purify unto himself a water a peculiar people zealous of water in other words to live a christian life become something you long for it you are ready for it you have zeal to live like a christian it is not something it's not a life somebody's pushing you but you eager to live like a christian hallelujah he want us to be a priest he want us to be a holy and he want us to be not only a holy a peculiar somebody that they look at and they see something different than anybody else people know when somebody look at you they say where is this specie why is this boy behaving different than everybody in this high school [Music] hallelujah continue in 1st peter 2 verse 9 the bible says but here a water election and a water so the priesthood god was looking at was royal priests because remember the queen just like the king amen hallelujah royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar water peter put all of them together are you there because then a vertical priesthood was done away then the melchizedek priesthood was introduced [Music] hallelujah why do you did you chose us in this generation why should we be royal priesthood and a holy nation and a peculiar people that you should do at him show forth the what the presence of him who has called you out of water into his water so when people see you they see the gospel when people see you they see the expression of redemption when people see you they can understand what it is if god cleaned me i'm going to be like him [Music] which in tampa were not a water that was the gentile but i am now a water which had obtained water but now ahead of 10 water dear beloved i beseech you at strangers and pilgrim abstain from freshly lust which war against your water hallelujah revelation chapter 1 verse 5 and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the priests of the kings of the water the priests of the water how many kings are they who are those kings are those kings who are those kings remember that priesthood must be what royal if it's royal the royal land have to come from judah that's why the lord came out of judah we are not anybody we are children of the king we are royal bloodline we are kings in this earth are you there never were a complex in your life you are a child of the king hallelujah brother branham spoke about a story of a slave that was taken from africa but even though he was in a strange land he behaved like a queen hallelujah that building didn't do him anything while he was sleeping didn't make any difference what he was eating was not making any difference the revelation in his heart was greater than all circumstances he was a child of the king and he behaved like a king hallelujah blessed be the lamb of the lord he has begotten us from the dead and the priests of the kings of the earth unto him that deed water and did what brother branham said that word wash means to lose you everybody here and watch that from our sin into his own blood did he stop there and he made us water and water he made us king and priests unto god and his water so the purpose of god that he wanted to express in israel was actually fulfilling christ [Applause] now when you get in christ automatically you are a king and you are a priest [Applause] god wanted his entire church his entire brother to be priests and to be king everybody create so far what is the purpose of being a king and being a priest take exodus chapter 28 hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord exodus 28 if you dare you can say amen amen exodus 28 verse 2 [Music] but robert gathered already he's always again ahead of the game but it's good when you see somebody ahead you got the ball you're just passing the ball and he's caught amen exodus 28 are you there verse two somebody got it praise god and you shall make water for aaron the priest you okay for aaron your brother for water and what for what so the government of the priest in the old testament was a government that when you look at the prison that government must reflect two things what are they glory and water so your garment must be beautiful you cannot wear a paint of gin that looks like a crazy man you cannot wear a chin that look like somebody who's coming out of a nightclub your clothing as a priest must reflect the glory and must be what beautiful hallelujah and you shall make holy garment and her and aaron for aaron your brother for glory the purpose of those garments and for beauty verse three and you shall speak to all that are water so does government have to be made not by anybody remember in the garden of eden we had two wisdom that's why you don't want to miss a sermon you remember there was the wisdom of god and the wisdom of the devil there were two wisdom but the one who fashioned the clothing of the king must do it with another wisdom because adam fashioned his own clothing with the wisdom of the devil using fig leaves and christ came and cursed the fig tree and god came and manufactured himself clothing you ready let's keep moving we're climbing eye and you shall speak to all that are wise-hearted which wisdom moses be a little bit specific whom i have did what i have filled with water the spirit of water so those people that were making clubs were not just making clothes any kind of way they were making clothes under the wisdom of the holy ghost because it's a cloth that's gonna be given to a priest and that cloth must reflect the beauty of god and the glory of god hallelujah i have filled with the spirit of wisdom that they may make aaron's garment to consecrate him that he may minister to me in the priest's office anybody clear verse 4 and these are the garment which they shall make a branch plate and an earphone and a water so a priest has the robot a robe hallelujah and a robe camera and a brothered coat and a middle which is a turban like a hat and a girdle and they shall make holy garment for aaron your brother and his son that he may minister to me in the priest office jump to verse 31 hallelujah you there we found here that the priests have a robe ha was daruba of a priest verse 31 you there and you shall make the robe everybody clear of the effort all of water [Music] the color of the globe the robe must all be made out of blue we already explained you what the blue color is brother branham say in the baptism of the holy spirit he said the perfect spirit of love read blew the perfect spirit of water in the message the hebrew brother branham said he become from spirit the great fountains of the rainbow of god who had no beginning or no end he was forever god this ray of light went forth and was a ray of love and that is the main one red the next color follows which was water blew the color of water so right here blue represented trueness truth and he also represents a spirit of fellowship and jesus said in john 4 23 that the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipper shall worship the father in water and in water are you following me are you following me so when somebody look at the robe of the priest that rob must speak about the truth that rob must speak about somebody who is in contact with someone somebody who is in fellowship with somebody when you dress yourself when people look at you they say you are not of this world it looks like you are in contact with another world it looks like you don't live in america i am not american i am not african i am a child of the king [Applause] you're clothing is showing a fellowship it's fellowship with who your clothing shows that your friends are in the prison your clothing shows that you are in contact with prostituted your clothing shows your fellowship [Music] if you get in the wrong crowd you want to begin to wear clothes like them and when somebody sees you we can tell you already got into a bad company by the way you dress because if you dress like a christian you'll be an oddball into that company so for you to fit that company you must alter your clothing so that your friend will make fun of you your clothing determine your fellowship [Music] hallelujah let's go to 31 you shall make the robe of ethel all of water blue and there shall be a hole in the top of it in the midst thereof and it shall have bonding of woven work run about the whole of it as if he were the whole of her virgin that he be not right god doesn't want that testimony to be destroyed everybody here god don't want that robe to be rented god don't want your pair of jeans to be torn [Music] god doesn't want you to wear clothes that are torn hallelujah verse 23 and be myth upon the ham in other words on the bottom of your robe you shall make pomegranate of blue and of purple and of scarlet round about the helm of it and bears of gold between them round about everybody follow me a golden bell and a pump grenade a golden bell and a pomegranate a golden bell upon the hem of europe round about in other words gold blue gold red gold purple god deity speaking about redemption deity speaking about true name deity speaking about adoption are you there 35 and it shall be upon aaron to minister and his son shall be heard when he goes in the holy place before the lord and when he come out that he dies not so the clothing has to make noise not noise to magnify gucci not noise to magnify my call you can wear gucci you can wear mica call but you're closing when you put them they should not be speaking more about michael cole [Music] they should not be speaking more about your brain they should not be talking more about versace but your character should override the clothing because the spirit that you have will anoint your clothes and when people see you walking we can tell you want to show off and the other person can wear the same clothes but they are not noticed all somebody said he said he looks beautiful but when you go somebody's saying he's trying to show off hallelujah are we okay praise be the name of the lord let's go to verse 36 and you shall make a plate of pure gold engrave it upon like the engraving of the signal grave what holiness to the water because you are a holy nation i want when you go it's speaking about holiness everybody follow me by the follow it's beautiful it's for god's glory not going looking crazy are you there so right here we found out that the priests have a robe and that rob that we see it is getting from the neck of the priest all the way to the feet it is a rob that is covering his entire body everybody follow me that's the robe of the priest let's jump to verse 42. let me see my time we good are you there verse 42 and you shall make damn water bridges are under you know what a bridge is right right under cover underneath clothes so the priest had two clothing the priest had a robot which was enough sad clothes are you there and the priests have also a bridge or an underneath close amen i'm going to say it later amen and you shall make them line and bridges to cover the water so the bridges are the underneath clubs god wanted to cover the nakedness that started down on the top you already should be covered but where life started where the problem was in the garden of eden what caused the fall now god is dealing with it hallelujah and you shall make them learning bridges to cover the water in the garden of eden god cover the nakedness now god is very specific remember i'm not dealing with the top we're dealing with your skirt amen to cover not to fit not to fit not from feeding but covering it to cover your nakedness from the water even to the water where brother greg got the mail amen from their loins even to the thai they saw water so right here god says the robe goes from the top all the way to the bottom but the bridges will go from the lawns all the way to the time you follow me from that if we don't teach this we're going to be legalistic [Music] now don't say they told me in the message we don't do this the scripture says brother branham say the scripture says brother branham say the scriptures say what branham says then it's not going to be your pastor it's going to be the word of god because the message came out of the bible are you there the clothing start from the loins all the way to water to the side to go to water so according to god did you get it according to god when you begin to deal with the lower part god is more interested that you cover a certain portion that he's considering on the lower part as what because that's where causes the scene which height of skirt should you wear which heart which height if somebody put a skirt here is he wrong if they put the skirt here is he wrong if they put a skirt here is there wrong let me start it again somebody missed the the lesson if somebody put a skirt here they're wrong if somebody put the skirt here they're wrong if somebody put the skirt here they're wrong if somebody put the skirt here they're wrong brother branham did you teach something like this in the message hallelujah in the message brother problem say the underneath government in palestine closes at the what why did he learn that where did brother branham learn it why did brother branham says that did he give you a scripture was brother branham lying again in this church the message and the bible are perfectly in line you are not feeding upon the word of men you are feeding upon the unfailing by the word of the son of man he's just using my voice but the one talking is him why did brother branham says the underneath government the breaches stood closest at the what why did he learn that go search the message go home and do what the underneath government in palestine closes at the water so not only was the priest dressing like that but the entire palestine was dressing like that because god wants the whole kingdom to be like priests the underneath government in palestine closes at the knee and then the word everybody clear and then the robe goes over there in the message and welcome christ now the palestinian government underneath it fits just above the water and the robe went under the unwelcome cross and the palestinian government come down as a water the outside but the underneath garment button just below the work any question but in the washing of jesus feet the palestinian government has an underneath government and then they rob over that the palestinian government is down to the knee physically he did not feel it the palestinian government is what [Music] this rub must be loose not tight the palestinian government is a loose government and they have underneath government that goes down about that's why you hear brother brad i'm saying that it is coming from the scripture even jesus christ have to garment in john 19 then the soldiers when they had crucified jesus took his water and made how many parts the roman soldier divided the garment of jesus in full part that was the outside garment everybody clear but look at the inside garment to every soldier apart how many soldiers were there and also he's what there was a second government that was under it was called his coat a cotton was without water woven from the water throughout so jesus had two government but the first one the outside was divided in four by four roman soldier but the inside was never touched everybody because the roman spirit came according to the teaching of the seven church churches the roman spirit attacked the church and they fall cavalier are you there and when jesus sits on the throne he also have four caribbeans so the outside government have to be attacked by four soldiers because four caribbean will react against the soldier when he come as a white horse rather than the anointing of a lion move he come as a red horse rather than the bulls move he come as a black horse rather than the men move and the last is a flying ego that's why they have to divide it in four parts that's the outside but there is sad they could not touch it because it's the person of jesus christ are you there mark chapter 14 and there follow him as certain man when they catch jesus christ there was a young man that was following them the bible said death was following a certain man having a line and clothes cast about his what in other words he didn't have the breaches and the young man laid hard on him and he left his water and fled from damn water this is a person who didn't wear his clothes appropriately [Music] i hope the holy spirit is talking to you never do that never do that that's why certain stuff from victoria's secret devil i hope you got it so according to the scripture this part is god is calling that nakedness and it's concerning the underneath clothes hey but clear let's go to isaiah 47. quick and i'm going to head to the airport my time is running up isaiah 47 ha ha should i wear my skirt [Music] isaiah 47 if you dare you can say amen then i head to the airport remember you only have one service on sunday you don't have sunday night service so no complain if we put two services then you're gonna really complain so you have one chill out one service the load you you go and you start thinking about it all over the day throughout the week before wednesday we load again amen and that takes you to the weekend we load again until you smell like the message isaiah 47 you there first one i'm going to hire you brother robert come down and sit in the dust or virgin daughter of who babylon sit on the ground there is no throne or daughter of the county for you shall no more be called tender and delicate take the milestone she was not doing work at home she was always watching tv take the milestone and grant the meal now put her to work uncover her what because she was wearing a veil she was virgin so uncover the lock we want to see her hair out uncomfort your locks come on make bad what if you notice when we say leg we usually say from here all the way there that's my leg but look how the scripture is changing uncomfortable the leg number one come on and uncover the what now if you notice the scripture is calling this the time makes sense and this is the what so the scriptures say take off her robe when you take off her rob she's going to uncover the leg makes sense but her tie is still covered now remove her tie what is going to come out of it watch the scripture uncover the tide pass over the river your water you see now you see now your nakedness shall be uncovered why because the tie is off makes sense now your nakedness shall be uncovered yeah your shame remembering the garden of eden when they were naked they were not ashamed when the nakedness open up then they will shape the two gods together amen and your shame shall be seen i will take vengeance i will not meet you i'll meet you as a man so now we clearly see from the scripture that this part here according to god on the lower part this from here all the way there god doesn't want it outside we clear sister hallelujah naom chapter 5 behold i may guess this say the lord of hosts and i will discover that what now we are talking about skirt you okay now i will discover that skirt a bird upon the water and i will shut the nest under water so when the skirt goes up it is exposing something god called nakedness and the kingdom that shame jeremiah 13 verse 28 therefore without discover that what upon that that's what marilyn monroe did when she stood under a ventilator you saw her hoarding and her it's devil demonic that's what the scripture is talking about and they put that as a big statute of marilyn monroe going against the scripture we not discover the skirt upon their face and the shell may have what appeared isaiah 20 so shall the king of assyria lead the way the who the egyptian prisoner and the etopian captive young and old naked and how even with the bad acts uncovered to the what so god is descriptive here showing that you must cover your back that's why some of victoria's secrets suffer from the devil you can wear an underneath clothes that only cover in the front i totally clearly explained it so you won't think twice what i was talking about everybody clear brother branham says this here what has stripper women it's made immoral everywhere the whole world become a conglomeration of immorality i heard the other day that some man down in florida was going to pass out not a bible a law that women had to dress how not disorderly orderly from there to the what to come down there i shall move to florida if it is why did brother brown made that statement you understand now why we shall dress orderly from where all the way to what hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord i don't know where i am come on amen yep take exodus 20. and now we head to the airport should my dress be how high should my skirt be you there exodus 20. brother stephen i'm going to go just right here so i cover the knee chill out i know some of you they won't want to go down they're still right at the limit if you say two they're going to step at two you push 2.5 they go to 2.5 they increase the income they increase the bill they increase their income they increase the bill that's why you're still in depth you don't want to stay away they're going to start giving children money yes you're going to increase your baby and you get back in the same circle don't know how to save let's go let's go that was a freebie let's go 2025 a sense of humor exodus 20 25 you there god said if you will make me an altar of stone you shall not build built it of union stone god doesn't want anybody to work on it for if you lift up your tool upon it you have polluted it in other words you want to make god an altar just take the stone and put it as natural as they can be don't artificial workout you ready watch the next neither shall you go up by steps to my water an altar in the scripture represented what remember a church remember neither shall you go in the church you see me i gave you that before neither shall you go up by steps to my altar that's your water be not water discover they're wrong so god says when you even building my temple i don't want you to build temple like hidden because the temple you're gonna go way up because i don't want when you are worshiping me i don't want you to expose your nakedness you follow me in other words you should never come in the house of god with a cloth that exposes your nakedness you should not have a cloth that when you worship god when it goes up we see your nakedness make sure you have a cloth no matter how you dance in the spirit no matter what you do in the spirit your cloth is still protecting you and not showing your nakedness brother branham i was preaching here in phoenix not long ago on something like that the minister's wife sitting on the pulpit with one of these boys bob hair all kinked up and with a dress that she could even knead she could even keep her underneath skirt from shannon in the tree couldn't death down over her what in other words your dress when you are sitting a sister your dress must still cover your knee when you are sitting because when you expose your tower you are exposing your nakedness god doesn't want us to see your knees how high should be your skirt put your surgery on your skirt at home go ahead and sit down and watch how your skirt goes up if you're knees are still covered you got a thicker inspection if it's not if your knee begins to show up take it out you are already exposing your nakedness everybody clear how high should be your dress any more questions that she could not even keep could not get over her knee about four or five inches above her knee sitting up there jumping up and down leading song in other words she we are display we have been put on a show of nakedness in vain do they worship in vain i blasted it just as hard as i could he won't invite me back i don't expect to but he knows what is right and wrong when i stand at the judgment it is not on my hand anymore some of those women on the platform with their dresses above their knees why keep brother branham keep using that for reference now when you read the message it's going to make sense all over the message above the knee and cut somewhat and show what because those dress must be loose what loose every move they make and they're underneath clothes what don't do that sister don't do that just as bad as wearing water or bikini or anything else in other words your long dress that you're doing is nothing we can see everything the purpose was for you to cover now we can see it it doesn't matter how long your dress is you pentecostal brand loud audition preacher how long will god suffer you i don't know god be merciful to your blind eyes he's got i served tonight to open your eyes that you might see let me head to the airport brother branham what do you think about our sister in the church wearing such short dresses doesn't it mar our testimony and set a wrong example for our young people in our world in our church to see a grown woman wearing a dress so short that he shows her what when she water so when you put your dress at home not only do you sit for your inspection you gotta stand and walk back and forth and make sure when you walk back and forth your knee doesn't show any question the bible says what abraham is saying ever who you are sister or brother whoever is this i what with you what it is a what a disgrace for a sister while she's walking her knees are showing because according to god in the scripture from here all the way to the knee which is the end of your tie bone it must it's called is considered nakedness but tell me what to do about them i preach it just as hard as i know how to preach they do it the same so it is their water because the word went forth like i did it today i'm certainly against them all skin tight dress that look i constantly fasted my kids becky and sarah i don't care how little they are so start when they're younger i just fasted him all the time start when they're younger [Music] because kids you can expect that that in kids you have to correct them but when it comes to a woman there is something wrong because you already grown up you should know better ever clear oh my god make sure yo you are properly orderly dressed from here all the way there and if you go down that's still correct because the knees are protected everybody clear anybody clear why do we wear skirt down long you got talking to them they kind of give you a shoulder isn't that right they know that's right if there is a lady in them they know that's what but you see they can't humble themselves to that women has become so densely feminist and so far more attractive and what is it they dress themselves more attractive the women used to wear what flowing and what ah brother stephen you have not touched the sleeve and sleeves and long water and heat their water because they didn't want men to last for them no tight watch what the scripture says now we live here but we are not american we are christian our kingdom is from above is of above if our life comes from up there then we act like it because our life is from a holy place a holy nation it looks different and he dresses how the women up there has water and they don't wear manicure on their face and they don't wear shorts they wear skirt and long rope and water and they have long rare the nature of it from up there reflect back on us in other words the way you dress here you are reflecting your theophany let me finish this but stephen please touch the sleeve now first question i pull out here brother branham is he wrong for a christian to put her hair in the pinker we already discussed this also what length should her sleeve be ah yeah yeah i was waiting for this before i go home thank you sister and the life of the slave i think being a christian god will tell you what to do about those things when the holy ghost come he shall lead you and guide you in all you see i believe as a christian person you know about how to do that i don't think god cuts any certain land for whatever it is as long as you are and look what and what i think that's all right that is just my this is who you remember paul you remember paul what is stephen how long should be my sleeve come on up she used to meet a lady that was way up there and come up to the church and she said you know what's the matter with you it is that crazy preacher you got up there that is what it is i said he believed all that stuff and i would not pay no attention to that this was a woman that saw a lady that goes to brother branham and then they look at the lady they say yes we know the way you dress and all the stuff that to do it is because of your crazy preacher there that is teaching you all this stuff you should not mind your crazy preacher look at the answer of the woman he said she say it is not my preacher it is my that is that tells me no more brother stephen no more the message no more brother branham your god that is in your heart [Music] show us your sleeve we will know what god is in you but remember when you put your sleeve god doesn't want to see any nakedness in the church when you worship him say why you are just he's just narrow-minded that's all there is she said you mean my lord is narrow-minded she said no matter what my preacher would say my lord in my heart tell me that women should dress in water everybody if you're looking for a legalistic in the broad preview when she come in i seen the most prettiest bunch of clean dressed women i ever seen in my life but each one of them looked like was dressed different they all had long hair and they were long sleeve and skirt and so forth you know where your skirt should be you know where your sleeve should be if not you drop in a legalistic i don't want to put my hand on the god's people i want the holy spirit himself to do that and coming this way was the lovely bunch of women real dressed nice long hair fixed tonight nice in the back sleeve and skirt down how anybody can that's not a problem why is it not a problem because it's hiding the nakedness that's not a problem because it's hiding the nakedness this won't be a problem as long as you make sure you hide your but when you get to this frontier you're in trouble there this won't be a problem this this will be a problem this will be a problem by the time you sit down your knees are up this is a problem by the time you say hallelujah then we gotta close our eyes amen when i see woman coming down the street with long skirt and hair done up neatly in the back and decent looking dress on i see another young lady maybe the same age with a little pearl shirt on she may be look nice twice as pretty as the woman with a long hair according to the looking of the world but i'll take my side with the girl that is dressed like a christian though they will be laughing and and calling her fanatics yet i take my son by faith she sees him who is invisible who is not guarding her amen let me get this and we're going to close here and this is to balance you up can i get two minutes you need this to balance you up as a church you ready many times people misjudge one another and it's a bad thing to do you say why she got shorter she's wearing her dresses too short that is not the holy spirit upon her don't do that don't do that that is not right you don't know what is in that woman's heart you don't know nothing about it you know that the holy spirit would make her conduct herself a little better that may be true but i tell you as long as i you and i let god do the judging of that let you and i just pray for that person that god will show them the water here some time ago a man met me out here and i had a pianist here that had a little short little skirt and was not just exactly i guess just right the lady had shot her and she was here in the she was uh sometimes somebody might be new in a message they don't know any better be careful they have accepted the message they're still going through the cleanup some of you were in the former church that we were but you were not in the message you were going to the message church but you were not in the message yet now that these things begin to unfold to you you are like a baby in the message and a man met me out there and just tear me to pieces he said you were pentecostal preacher you let that woman sit up there that short hair just going on like everything the men begin to bow brother brother listen to brother brahma well i say i think the woman has a god has a good spirit in her i certainly do not agree with that you know the skirt part up there the two pieces brother branham didn't condone with her dressing brother branham still condemned the dressing but brother branham was looking at her as a newborn in the way one of them is down here and one canned up here it's a shirt like the way and it's real thin and show the underneath government that they had around that should not be done i don't like that i don't really don't they might be just as spirit-filled as anybody else i don't know god knows that but i would not condemn that woman and say that she was going to hell by the side this same person that was condemning god brother had in his church a lady who had and war water and a temper enough to fight a bar song she had a lady that was living poor but was not leaving peter outside she was good but the heart was bad [Music] enough temper to fight the basso and just as what as mean as she could be now long hair and long skirt don't take you to heaven it doesn't mean you don't wear long hair but if your character is wrong with your long dresses you going to hell no sir it's the water that is in you take you to water that character and this is the end then you should remember that many pastors don't mention those things and the people just automatically go on think it's all right but a pastor should really tear into it that's what i'm doing and then the sister of the church those sisters who are in water wearing their clothes how they should be example of what and what and what i think that any woman that is motherly and godly and sisterly ought to go to such a person and with water not arrogant just sit down and talk to that lady and if she is of god the holy spirit will understand those things and she shall correct how but when you will quickly condemn her and drive her away you might harm that young born baby i will knock on condemn that person how long should your dress be make sure your knee when you sit when you walk when you jump we don't see your knee your knees let your husband see it hey how long should your sleeve be check with the spirit on you make sure when you wear your sleeve do this do that make sure nobody sees what is going on everybody clear if you see somebody struggling before you talk to him check your heart if you have a jealousy spirit a mean spirit a bad spirit a spirit that wants to fight a legalistic spirit don't go correct to that lady come and talk to the deacon let me go handle it because i'm a pastor but if you are sweet you yourself are an example and you dress nicely and you have a nice sweet spirit then you can approach that young sister or that young person or that baby in the gospel it with respect and talk to her so that the holy spirit can show her the light that you already have seen all mine's clear let's stand lord willie we're going to head to 45 let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly father this afternoon thanking you for everything lord when we are confronted with questions pastor how long should be our dress or our skirt sometime it's tight that we don't even know what to answer but father we thank you for your grace that was there enough to open this scripture and when we looked at the scripture we went into the message of the hour we found her everything dovetailed and now we understand what to bring to your children and what lord father to edify the church with so that it's not going to be something that is based on our personal preference but it will be solely based upon the word and the revealed word of the hour lord we have preached many things in this church we have touched many territory in this church we have touched many territory that we have lord father demonstrated and today you put on our heart lord father for those that had questioned to find their answer on how they should present themselves to the public to be written epistle to be an example to reflect your beauty to affect your fellowship to reflect your glory to reflect the deity to reflect lord father your character so that they may be the salt of the earth that can lord bring thirst to other people's life other young people going to other churches that they want to be like them lord father you don't have another hand but our hand lord you don't have another body that you can use on this earth now because you took your own body and you put it on the cross lord as a propitiation for our sin lord but now you are borrowing the body of your bread to express lord your gospel and you use the woman lord that you have chose since the garden of eden as adored lord father to express your attribute now you are using her in this end time as a door to express your holiness lord father may you give a revelation to this church a revelation to the young man a revelation to the young sister a revelation to the mothers and father lord so that they might realize oh god lord father the hour that we are living that this world is dying this world is looking for real true epistle that they can look into it that they can fellowship with it that they can read christ jesus christ in our life and in the way that we behave father may the holy spirit continue to minister to your children and if somebody is liking your spirit lord father may this morning they find grace that can open the doors of heaven lord and father i'll bring them the holy spirit lord down deep in their soul that can guide them in all truth lord because hearing the word is one thing but doing it lord father he takes the holy spirit we are tired of doing our own work lord we did it we fell many times we did it and it causes us to have a self-righteousness it causes us to have frustration when lord father we fell to do what we know we were supposed to be doing but lord father we understood that this work is a work of rest lord may you come lord father the holy spirit and may you guide our life our individual life lord so that it will not be us living lord but it's gonna be christ jesus christ living through us lord and manifesting your own life father we thank you for the grace the church gave me to go over the time lord father lord may you bless them may you protect them may you continue to minister lord and to reveal them your word individually lord in their personal life we commit them unto the hand and we pray for those that are sick in the body or those that came with different needs lord father in their personal life lord that you meet their needs lord and you give them a good answer lord and you give them a life of miracle throughout this week lord if you terry to come father we ambly ask it lord in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you church we love you [Applause] [Music] oh yes i'm a child of the king for his royal blood [Music] [Applause] [Music] who was wretched
