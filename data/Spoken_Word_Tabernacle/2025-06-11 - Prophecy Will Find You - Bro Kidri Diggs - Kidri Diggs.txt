Let's just have a word of prayer and we'll get right into the word of God tonight. If you have a need, you can acknowledge to the Lord by uplifted hand. Let's pray. Lord Jesus, Father, we are counted a privilege to be in the house of God. Amen. Lord, in a place that we know has been dedicated for your use, Lord, for your voice, your presence, your touch, everything that you are, Lord, we want to experience, Lord, when we come together as believers. Amen. And Lord God, we bind any spirit that's not like you, any thought that's not like your thoughts, Lord. Any ways that's not like your ways, Lord. And Lord, we pray that that atoning blood would atone for anything that we've done today, Lord. or anything, Lord, that's out of character, Lord. We pray that that blood will continue to purge and sanctify us into the image of your mind and your thoughts, Lord, and what you have for us, Lord. We just pray tonight, Lord God, that in hearing, Lord, they may hear what the spirit is saying, Lord, and see, Lord, and understand, Father. And most of all, Lord, help us to walk in the word. We don't just want to be hearers, but we want to walk in the word, Lord. Lord, we want to become, Lord, the very things that we're hearing, Lord. And Lord, we'll give you all the honor and glory, Lord, in the precious and master's name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Let the church say, "Amen." Amen. Amen. If you have your Bibles, let's turn to Matthew chapter 24. Matthew 24. Um, let's start reading at uh verse three. Matthew 24:E3. If you have say amen. Amen. The Bible says, "And as he sat upon the mount of olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, tell us, when shall these things be, and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world?" And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you. For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ, and shall deceive many, and ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that ye be not troubled. That's right. For all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nations shall rise against nations, and kingdoms against kingdoms, and there shall be famines and pestilence, and earthquakes in diverse places. All these are the beginning of sorrow. Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and kill you, and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake. And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another, and many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. Amen. Let's turn to um second Peter. Second Peter verse one. Second Peter chapter one. I'm sorry. Chapter one. I think I want verse Let's start at verse uh 18. Second Peter 1. Yeah. Um the Bible says, "And this voice which came from heaven, we heard when we were with him in the holy mount, we have also a more sure word of prophecy, where unto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, unto the day I mean until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts. Amen. May the Lord bless the reading of his word. You can have your seats. As we're sitting, I want to I want to read uh one more verse of scripture. Uh Ephesians chapter 5 and verse 25. The Bible says, "Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without blemish." Amen. Tonight, by the grace of God, I want to use for a subject, prophecy will find you. Prophecy will find you. Amen. And you know, uh, if we're all paying attention to what's taking place in our day, we can understand that prophecy is being fulfilled. Hallelujah. It's being fulfilled in our government. It's being fulfilled in our homes, our churches. Wherever we go, we should be able to see that prophecy is being fulfilled. That's right. But let's understand what prophecy is. Prophecy is the foretelling of what's to come. Hallelujah. Prophecy is the foretelling of the future events, maybe in in in the world or even in your life. Hallelujah. But the prophecy we're dealing with is Bible prophecy. Hallelujah. We're not dealing with just whatever anybody may say. We're dealing with something that cannot change. Hallelujah. We're dealing with hallelujah a book of prophecy. And I want everybody to understand that this book of prophecy can't be altered. This book of prophecy will never fail. So whatever we can find in this Bible, we need to hold fast to it. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. There's a lot of churches, there's a lot of uh uh uh worshippers and a lot of people got different gods. Hallelujah. But there's only one book of prophecy. [Applause] The Buddhas don't have it. Hallelujah. The Muslims don't have it. Hallelujah. And on and on of different religions. Hallelujah. But we have a Bible. Hallelujah. That's been ordained before the foundation of the world to show us where we are. Hallelujah. I if you don't mind, I'm going to read a little bit tonight by the grace of God. Now the prophet of God says now the Bible is a different book from any other sacred book. That's right. See there's a lot of sacred books. The Quran and Kaf Confucious and all these other people Buddhism he says but the Bible is a different book. It's a sacred book. Why? It's a book of prophecy that will come to pass. Listen. He says there's no book like the Bible because the Bible is God's word. [Applause] Glory to God. So when we consider this Bible now we going to step out here hallelujah in the plank because there's a lot of things that been said but we want to we want to show and prove what we believe. Now, now uh uh uh we we consider ourselves to be believers of this message. Hallelujah. But our prophet came and told us that the Bible should be your absolute. Hallelujah. And I'mma step way out there. I'm not talking about the New International Version. [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah. I'm not talking about the make it easy version. I'm not talking about the the Bible for dummies version. He said the closest thing Hallelujah interpreted to what God had for us in the beginning is the King James version. [Applause] [Music] Yes, sir. So be careful what you read. Because you you you you can get a Bible that doesn't tie in with this message. And the Bible and the message is not two different things. It's one. So while we out here, we going to jump on out here. The message is infallible. [Applause] I'm not talking about the man. I'm talking about the word. The word is infallible. And the prophet of God said, hallelujah, that the Holy Ghost came and went, "Oh, I'm Oh my. [Applause] The reason why we study the message is because the message gives me insight on the understanding of my Bible. God sent a prophet, hallelujah, to open up our understanding of what was already in the word. [Applause] Remember, when he opened when God opened the seals, the prophet said clearly, it has to already be there because you can't add to the word of God and you can't take away from the word of God. Therefore, it had to be a special anointing on the person that's interpreting the word, not just somebody who went to school for theology. It has to be somebody inspired of God, anointed of God. Listen, because the Bible is the word of God. Hallelujah. So the word of God in this Bible is one. God is his word. In the beginning was the word and the word was with God. Now we know that the prophet of God say hallelujah. That there were three Bibles. Hallelujah. He said that there's the pyramid. Hallelujah. He said there's the zodiac. And then he said there's the written Bible. But I challenge you to say that there's a fourth one. [Applause] The Bible says, hallelujah, in Corinthians, hallelujah, that is no longer written in tables of stones, but is written in the fleshly hearts of the believer. So when you become what you're reading, you become the word. He drops on down and he says the word became flesh. It's not a different Bible. It's the same Bible behind badger of skin. It's not a different message from William Brandom. Is the same message behind badger of skin. [Applause] But the problem is people don't believe the Bible is the absolute. That's right. They're looking for something to make it easier to understand. That hasn't been Hallelujah. inspired by devout men of God that God chose. So they say, "Well, we're going to make a new international version for for young people so they can understand it." He talking to the young people in the King James. He said, "We're going to make a version for the sisters to be able to understand." He talking to the sisters in the King James. Say, "We're going to make a version so the men can be good husbands." He's talking to the husbands. Yes, sir. Yes sir. Yes sir. What happens is we don't have enough people studying their message [Applause] because the study of the message gives you understanding of the written word. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] My brother let's go. Yes sir. Listen what he says. He says it's got to come according to the word if it comes from God because it's to vindicate or prove God's presence and he forneew all things being by his for fornowledge he ordained hallelujah for ordained is called in the Bible predestination every age to its place so God has showed us according to the Bible where we are right now. That's why I said hallelujah. Prophecy will find you. Now, we can look at all the different things taking place according to prophecy. Let's just start with the with the latest thing that is taking place based upon what we believe. An American pope. I'm sure we've been talking about it. An American pope prophesied in 1954. And after it was prophesied, nine months later, this pope was born. [Music] Could it have been a vindicated Malachi Revelation 10:7 prophet seeing where he was in time? Then he begin to speak the future according to what he believed. Was to come [Applause] Oh my my listen. He said every every age to his place and every man to his place. So according to prophecy, there's some place each and every one of us is supposed to be. You have a place in prophecy. There's a word that's been spoken just for you. And only you can fulfill it. So that word will find you. So church, what I love to say, Hallelujah. Amen. What I love to say when I was born, Hallelujah. The prophet of this day wasn't here. But Billy Graham was here. Hallelujah. Or Roberts was here. They didn't have a word of prophecy for my life though. So their voices didn't mean nothing for me. It was a voice of a seventh angel that I could connect with. What was it? It was a voice of prophecy. Yes, sir. That would find me and pull me into the lifestyle, pull me into the vindication of the word I'm supposed to walk in. It's not by coincidence. You have [Applause] see [Applause] what we've done. We can easily see who and where the prophet is according to prophecy. Hallelujah. But if you can see him, that's right. You should be able to see yourself. If you can see an American pope, you should be able to see where you are. If you if you have seen or if you have saw Kla Harris in a purple outfit standing there vindicating prophecy that was spoke about years and years, 1933 [Music] [Applause] See, when I see these things coming to pass, it don't make me inquire more about the pope. It make me inquire more about me. Who am I? What am I supposed to be doing? Am I ready for a body change? Because if I can see, hallelujah, a spoken word vindicated 71 years later, that tells me first of all, I'm in the right place. There are so many things according to prophecy have already happened. You know some people are listening to the wrong voice or they don't have the right understanding. That's why God gave us a messenger with a message so we'll have the right understanding. And people left and they say oh prophet said before Billy Paul died this going to happen that going to happen he old man. Let me let me tell you something already happened already already happened. The sharks have already swam there. [Applause] People waiting on something that have already took place, already happened. [Applause] [Music] There are so many things that he spoke about that have already happened. They say, "Oh, we waiting for them to open up a tent, have a tent vision." Already happened. Hallelujah. You What's What is that little room? That little room is you all along with God behind the veil. That's you going back there in the Chicago glory. Hallelujah. Remember he said it will not be a public show. It ain't going to be no building of a tent. It's you behind the veil with God. It's already found us. [Music] [Applause] Be careful who you let interpret the scriptures. Cuz remember he said false prophets will arise. This one saying that the seven the eighth angel, the eighth and a half angel, the angel of doves. All this nonsense that's not in the scripture. I don't see no other angels coming after the seventh angel but the mighty one. And the mighty one is in his bride. So if he comes that mean he's coming back for me. [Applause] [Music] Listen. He says, "So if we can see by the by his word what age and what time we're living, you'll see it right here in the Bible." [Applause] Revelations 13 is who? America. Right in the Bible. Hallelujah. The Bible says, hallelujah. That the leaders of the world will give the authority to it. Give it to them. Every time they meet, what they do? They bow down and worship him, giving him the authority of their kingdom. Stay right there. Look, sir, we know these things. Hallelujah. But I think we're concentrating too much on what the devil is doing. See, the pope, the devil, all that prophecy is the mounting up of the mark of the beast. But if I can see the mark of the beast forming up, [Applause] I should also see the same life that was in the vine that's now in the branches. And we should be able to produce the same thing that Christ produced, brother because of prophecy. If you can see the devil, listen to me now. Hallelujah. The mark of the beast is the devil incarnating himself into his one. So if we can see the devil about to incarnate. [Applause] What about God's carnation? What about God's carnation? How many of you have found your place of adoption? That's what prophecy should be doing for us. We should know our place. [Applause] I'm not excited about no American pope. I'm not excited about Donald Trump. I'm excited, hallelujah, about my place. Because if I can see the devil come into full strength, I should be able to speak those things that are not as though they are, I should be able to walk up to my mountain and say, "Mountain, move, cuz I'm a son of God. Move, cuz I'm a son of God. Move, cuz I'm a son of God." Yes. Listen, even in our time, songs are coming out that should fulfill the prophecy. That's right. There's a song called I know who I am. a chosen generation [Applause] called forth to show his excellence. [Applause] I'm walking in power. [Applause] [Music] I'm producing miracles. We got songs identifying who we are. That's right. But we're looking for the easy life. No, we're not looking for the easy life. Listen, listen what the prophet of God says. I want to stick right with it with the Bible. Young people, don't get mad at mom and daddy. We just messengers. We're just bringing to you God's word and God's word will get you out of here. We're just messengers. We're just agents of the most high. It ain't our word. It's his word. Listen [Applause] this is what he says for all of you who might have a new international version. We ain't even checking for it in those Bibles. They're taking verses out. Some of those New International Versions don't even have John 1:1 in it. Because it's there to water down who God is. You hear people say, "Uh-uh, you religious. I'm spiritual." How you spiritual and won't live God's word? [Applause] That's what they consider to be spiritual. Oh, I pray. Yeah. But do you get answers? Do you know him? Prayer is a relationship with God. Hallelujah. Listen. Listen. He says, "Yes, sir." Everybody all right? He says, "You will recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book we are studying is the actual revelation of Jesus Christ. This Bible, this word of God is the revelation of Jesus Christ, the understanding of God. [Music] When we catch it, we catch who God is. We begin to understand who he is. [Music] That's exactly right. That's not with knowledge. That's with the conversion of the Holy Spirit because he hides himself from the wise and prudent. Listen, he says of this message, this book we are studying is the actual revelation of Jesus Christ. Jesus himself in the church and his work in the future ages. So when you see Hallelujah and understand this Bible, you see Christ in you. That's right. Which is what? See, see what what what has happened. Hallelujah. What has happened, brother Shimbo? Yes, sir. We read the message and we look at it say, "Man, that's a nice title. It's not a title. It's an event taking place on earth. The mighty God unveiled." That didn't happen in heaven. That happened on earth. He was unveiled on earth. Christ the mystery of God revealed. Where was he revealed? On earth. Cuz the just of that message, he said, "What's the mystery?" Christ in you the hope of glory. He preached a message called the contest. Where is the contest taking place? Yes, sir. He preached a message called the oddball. Who are the oddballs? It's not good titles. It's events taking place in the believer's life. [Applause] Hallelujah. Look, he preached a message called God's provided place of worship. Where is he? Where is his provided place? Somebody show me. If you think it's the church or the tabernacle, you need to go back to your Bible cuz God Hallelujah. the prophet brought out Moses built the tabernacle after a man. He did with the three courts. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We are the tabernacle. [Applause] Listen, what I'm preaching tonight is eagle food. And if you're not studying, you lost. Church, we're about to get out of here. You got to know where you at. Prophecy will find you. You're going to fulfill the good or the bad, but you're going to fulfill some of it. Yes, sir. [Music] Listen. Glory to God. Listen, he says, "Bringing these two thoughts together, you will see that it won't take just ordinary study." No, sir. And thinking to make this book real, sir. No, sir. Men have studied the Bible for ages and they still running for revelation. [Applause] Do you know even brother Brandham he was f to say the white horse rider was God. But then God came in. God came in and gave him understanding. Where was Brother Brandham getting it from? He had pulled all the different teachers, pull all their thoughts and things together and that's what he came up with. Hallelujah. The inspiration of men will always lead you wrong. [Applause] Yes sir. Yes sir. Listen. He says it's going to take the operation of the Holy Spirit. That means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people. Yes sir. Come on church. Yes sir. A special class of people. A holy nation. A royal priesthood, a peculiar people, special class of people. [Applause] It's like y'all y'all y'all a bunch of fanatics. You following the man know I'm special. You can't see what I see. You see a white horse rider. I said, "Yeah, but I see he ain't got no arrows. Listen up. He got a Ba. He ain't got no arrows. A special class of people. That's right. We not afraid of the white horse rider cuz he got a bow and no arrows. That mean he can't do us no harm. [Applause] Look church, a special class of people, it will take one with prophetic insight. [Applause] So if you are understanding this message, it's because you have been giving prophetic insight. [Applause] Yes, sir. Oh, you thought it was just a prophet. No. To understand what the prophet is talking about, you have to be of the same caliber. You have to be of the same spiritual DNA. You have to have the same touch from God. That's why in Revelation 10, the mighty angel came down to meet the seventh angel. All of this was happening on earth, not in heaven, on earth. God came down, gave the book to the seventh angel. Hallelujah. Told him, "Eat it. Open it up." But who did the seventh angel give the book to? [Applause] If you studying this message, you are eating of the same revelation that the seventh angel had. That came from God. That's why we can see him 107. Hallelujah. But we are 8 through 11. That's right. Hallelujah. Cuz we eat the book. Hallelujah. It's bitter of sweet everything that the scriptures say. But it also says, "Thou must prophesy again." It ain't It ain't the seventh angel riding that trail. It's the bride of Christ. [Applause] [Music] The only way you put it back on the prophet is because you don't see yourself in the scripture. You got to see yourself in the scripture. Hallelujah. It do me no good to see who my messenger. [Applause] Look, Brother Diggs, where are we? I ain't going to be too much longer. Where are we? I want you to understand something. It's high time for us to produce what we've been reading all these years. It's time for us to produce this message. Hallelujah. Because there's a prophecy and then there's a manifestation of that prophecy. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. He said, "Not just," he say, "It will require supernatural instruction." Not just a student comparing verse with verse. That's not preaching. You saying, "I'm called just to go through the Bible and turn to the front and compare this verse with that verse." No, there has to be supernatural instruction, inspiration from God. Yes, sir. The problem is we got too many men who are really exorters. [Applause] They're exorters. And because they have understanding, they think they're preachers. Hallelujah. But preaching requires a gift, [Music] not knowledge of turning scripture to little scripture. You have to get out of the way so God can use your gift. Just because you understand the message doesn't mean you're called to preach. [Applause] Listen, [Music] he says not just a student comparing verse with verse, though that is good, but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear. And let me say this, hallelujah. The message of the hour should no longer be a mystery to you. The prophet has been revealed. God has been revealed. The bride has been revealed. [Music] So if you're looking for a a ministry to preach things in mystery form where you be like, "Oh, wow. Man, that was powerful. It was so powerful I didn't understand it. He not have preached it accordingly. He's not supposed to be preaching you a mystery. It's been revealed. So if it's a true gift, it'll make it clear. You'll be streaming, pastor, preacher, give me more cuz I understand it. That's exactly right, brother. If he's preaching this message and you don't understand it, that's not a true gift. No, it's not. Cuz God didn't use a man to confuse you. He used a man that couldn't mess it up. [Applause] He said, "But the mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear." That's right. So church, what we have to do is find out where we are. That's right. See, there's a prophecy and then there's a manifestation of that prophecy and it has to find you. Hallelujah. Remember he said he said that the word of God will not return unto him void. And spoken word is original seed. He said he said that voice goes out there. Yes, sir. And it stays out there until it finds its resting place. [Applause] And in another place he said the Holy Spirit is like that mother eagle who knew how many eggs she had. He said and what she does is she searches for that other life and she doesn't stop because she knows how many eggs she's had. If you belong to God, God's not going to rest until you get the Holy Spirit. That's nothing. Yes, my brother. See, what do we have? We have Hallelujah. A changing of the God. But the changing of the God is really the same mantle. That's the truth, brother. [Applause] It's not a different mantle. It's the same mantle. When two gods change places, this God don't go stand over here. No, he stands in the same spot guarding the same thing. And you know what, church? Hallelujah. We should see more of this message in our lives. You know what? I I like the I like the thought of Hallelujah. When Adam and Eve was kicked out, he put a seraphim there. Hallelujah. Guarding the way with a flaming sword. But in our day, we had a prophet who was given a sword. [Applause] So, we got the sword in time that stops it from moving that we can get back there now. We're back there behind that veil. [Music] Hallelujah. He also called that sword a strong hand of faith. [Music] Listen, let me run this down real quick so we can get out of here. You got to preach. Prophecy will find you. Because if prophecy spoke and found the pope for our day, will you know prophecy even found Barack Obama? That's right. The scripture says, hallelujah, just like it was in the days of Sodom, Luke 17. Yes, sir. Just like it was in the days of Noah. Yes, sir. God Oh, y'all might y'all might not like this. Yes, sir. Hallelujah. But God used Barack Obama to bring Sodom and Gomorrah on the earth and make it legal. 2010 2014 Obama Hallelujah. He took a He made it in the military. Don't ask, don't tell. It's all right to be a homosexual. What was it doing? It was making prophecy a manifestation. That's right. Stay right there. Amen. You say, "Well, brother D, it really see people in their Bible." They say, "Well, the Bible don't really say homosexual, [Applause] the Bible says you shall know them by their fruit, by their lifestyle." Okay. Well, let's let's go down to Sodom real quick. The angels come down. Hallelujah. come down to lighthouse because the iniquity, the sin, the smell of it reached up to God. And God said, "I'mma destroy that place because of the wickedness." What was the wickedness? Those handsome, glorious angels come down walking through the city. Men that have never been touched. Men that know no wrong. No tattoos, pure skin, didn't even need a tan, eyes clear, didn't even need no visine. Walked into Lot's house. And the men of the city never saw men like that before. And when they saw those men, they ran to Lot's house, baming on the door. And the Bible says, the Bible, the Bible says that those men said, "Give us those men." It's in your Bible. Give us those men and you look at you look at Lot's response to them. Why did he respond like this? His response was, "I have two daughters. that have never been touched. [Applause] He said, "I got two daughters." Basically, why do you want those men? That's exactly right. I got two daughters who've never been touched. And you know what they said? We don't want them. Give us those men. [Music] Amen. Read your Bible. It's in your Bible. Homosexuality. [Applause] [Music] And if it was okay, just what they were saying, give us those men. Make God angry. And God smoked them blind. That's right. Yes, sir. Take your time, my brother. [Applause] Take your time. The Bible say man should not lay with mankind. Woman should not lay with womankind. That's what the Bible says. Period. That's why this the scripture says stay away from false prophets, false teachers. There's a well-known preacher down there. I ain't going to tell where you from, but got a big church. 30, 40,000 people. Get up there every morning. This is my Bible. It is what it is. I can do what it says I can do. This is my Bible. The man had an interview and in the interview the interviewer asked him say, "Do you believe in the second coming of God?" He says, "Well, this is your Bible and you don't believe the Lord is coming back. false teachers, false prophets. In the same interview, the man also asked him, this pastor of this big, big church, he asked me said, "Well, what do you think about homosexuality?" He says, "Well, it's definitely not God's best. God's best. God ain't got nothing to do with it. That's it. That's it. That's it. False prophets, false teachers, sir. But that's not the end. Church, we got a war right now in Ukraine and Russia taking place is happening. Yes, sir. Hallelujah. Like I say, Obama rose up to fulfill prophecy. Hallelujah. To give the gays the rights that they need. Hallelujah. Obama also sided. Hallelujah. He also sided with the Supreme Court to make same-sex marriages okay. Yo, black president. They put the black man in office to fulfill the scripture. Hallelujah. Of homosexual rights. Obama. Obama. Obama. Obama. You better be careful what you cheering for. [Applause] Democrat or Republican, you better be for Christ and Christ alone. [Applause] Then he he leaves office. Trump gets in. Uh-huh. Right. The Bible says that there'll be famines and pestilence in the land. Hallelujah. We just had a famine of what? Eggs. People flooding, rushing to the stores. Oh, I got to get these eggs. The eggs got salmonella and all. Oh, it's a famine. The Bible said it was going to happen. But also pestilence. That word pestilence deals with plagues. We had one of the greatest plagues in our day of all time called COVID 19. Prophecy has been fulfilled. And what brother Shimbo, what we fail to realize, hallelujah, that these these things happened to fulfill prophecy. COVID 19 was just a forerun of a world one government. Cuz remember to say the whole goal is to make this thing a one world government, a one world order. What did we see doing? Co Russia was living the same way as the US. Yes, sir. The US the same way as Australia. Australia, Canada. All you people talking about, I ain't wearing no mask. Every morning you got up. That's right. Uh-huh. If you wanted to go to work, mask up. One world government. We already seen a preview of it. Amen. You couldn't travel unless you got a shot. Amen. Yes, sir. Where are we? And that's been now what? two years ago, three years ago, something like that, four years ago. You see how fast it goes and then we we we go right back to normal. We we go right back to normal. Well, I don't know if I'm going to make it tonight. Gas then went up. It's going to keep going up. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Brother Kelly, Brother Kelly, they better be glad I ain't a pastor cuz I'll say take the streaming down. Bring your behind the church. Take the streaming down. Come on and hear this word. That's why I'm not a pastor. Yes, sir. Pastor has compassion for your lack of God. [Applause] An evangelist. He just shoots and blasts to you dead. I don't have time to be worried about your feelings. I'm here to destroy the devil. I'm here to tell the devil, whatever you are, cancer, diabetes, sadness, pain, heartache, hallelujah, we got power over you. Cuz I know who I am. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Lord, there's a prophecy and a manifestation. Hallelujah. And we can see even in our own government the predesty things are taking place. Listen church. And even you say, "Well, brother D, what's happened?" Hallelujah. If you we we just tuck Barack, we just tuck uh h uh Trump. Let's hit slow Joe real quick. Slow Joe get in office and can't even operate. He's in office shaking hands with ghosts. When he first hallelujah got in the office and had the inauguration, the first thing he did was had a Catholic mask. Giving the authority to who? And he also was a fulfillment of prophecy of prophecy. Joe had to get sick. So Colama, whatever her name is, Kamala could take over office and fulfill what brother Brandham said, that a woman in purple will rise up in power and take over the country. That's exactly right. It happened. [Applause] [Music] She was a fulfillment of it. Hallelujah. Yes. And these things are taking right place right in front of us and we not even realize it. But enough of that. H look Isaiah 7:14 it says a virgin shall conceive. That was the prophecy. Luke 1:34 was Mary being the manifestation of that prophecy. Hallelujah. Years and years later she was a manifestation of it. Isaiah 40:3 it says the voice in the wilderness was a prophecy. John 1:23 was a fulfillment of that prophecy. They asked John, "Who are you?" He said, "I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness." Those prophecies found them. Hallelujah. Deuteronomy 18 and 15, the Lord shall raise up a prophet. That's Moses talking in prophecy. Matthew 17 and5 here ye him Jesus Christ was the manifestation of that prophecy [Applause] oh my I'm running out of time and like I just said like I just quoted Yes sir Luke 17:30 26-30 the days of Noah and Lot the prophecy Obama was a fulfillment of that Trump was a fulfillment of that hallelujah Biden was a fulfillment of at Hallelujah. All these things took place within the last eight years. Yes, sir. Amen. Where are we? Where are we? Yes, sir. We have a more sure word of prophecy. But listen, if we can see all that taking place, Yes, sir. what else should we be seeing? [Applause] What should we be seeing? Hallelujah. Yes, sir. What should be taking place? Yes, sir. Hallelujah. The seals have been revealed. Hallelujah. I'm not in the first seal. I'm not in the first four. That's the Antichrist. I'm not in the fifth seal. That's the souls under the altar. I'm not in the six seals. That's the Jews. So, where am I? Where are you, church? You are that seventh seal. Hallelujah. You are once you realize where you are, you become the living manifestation of the opening of the word. [Applause] Amen. Listen, before I get out of here, the prophet says, he says, "Now, here is what I'm trying to say to you. The law of reproduction, bring forth of its own kind." Genesis 1:11. These last days, true church, bride comes to the headstone will be the super church. [Applause] As she's nearing the headstone, she will be a super church. Amen. Now, that was prophesied back in 1962. We see the fulfillment of the pope. We see the fulfillment of the Catholic Church. We see the fulfillment of all the presidents. Where are you? Where is that super church? [Applause] [Music] You have a right to fulfill the prophecy. He said they will be much like him, so much like him. Even they will be in his very image. In the order to be united with him, they will be one. Amen. [Applause] Amen. That's who we are. And when the church is redeemed and rise in the resurrection, we are the bride of Christ. I say that reverely hoping we are believing we are by faith. We are the bride of Jesus Christ will have the same spirit in it. Amen. Amen. Amen. Yes, my brother. The same spirit. Yes, sir. Not a different Jesus. The same Jesus. Not a different What is the Holy Ghost? The Holy Ghost is the person of Christ living in you. And you mean to tell me I got Christ in me and I ain't got enough faith, hallelujah, for God to pay a bill? You mean to tell me I ain't got enough faith for a blood issue? [Music] If Christ is in you, it's the same God. [Applause] The prophet said, "Real revival is seeing your enemy and seeing God." Hallelujah. He says, "Now watch." He He said, "Give me this last one and I'll move out the way." He says, "Now watch what happened." Yes, sir. Now when his father after this child had been born in the family yet he did not inherit anything until his life proved out to be the right kind of a child and the tutor which is the Holy Spirit in our case brought word to the father all the time how this child was progressing. Now we're tried to jump the fence. You can't jump the fence. You got to walk through the gate. Hallelujah. When when we've tried to stick the cart before the horse, you tried to claim things and do things before God did it and got a got a lot of flesh work up into it. And that's what's the matter with the church. If real Pentecost of faith settled over the audience of the size of this size, brother, all California, Yes, sir. all Gastonia would know something happened up here tonight. He said real Pentecost of faith. Amen. If real Pentecost of faith would fall in this church tonight. Yes, sir. Amen. Everybody in Gastonia would know. He said there's something wrong. It isn't wrong with God. It isn't wrong with your faith. Catch it now. It is. It isn't wrong with God. It isn't wrong with your faith. It's being placed right. See, where are we? We're in the spot of adoption now. Yes, sir. There's enough faith in the church. Hallelujah. To create a world, live in it. But the thing of it is is too many of us are out of place. Once we get in place, God will do what he's always done. Adoption is your placing. Is not the Holy Spirit. No sir. No sir. No sir. It's not the Holy Spirit. Adoption is God using you divinely for what he created you for. He said it's being place right, knowing what you're doing and how to do it. That's the secret of the whole thing and then yielding yourself to the will of God, Lord. I tell you, it's in the Bible. Yes, sir. Amen. When you go and read, and I'm and I'm about to close. When you go and read the first introduction between Elijah and Elisha, when they first met, Elijah threw the mantle on him. That's exactly right. When he was a baby, he had potential to be a prophet. [Applause] When he was a baby, he had potential to fulfill what the prophet was doing, but he had to grow into it. That's why the prophet, hallelujah, told to Osborne, hallelujah, you can do it. Just go sit under that oak tree. And that's what's wrong with people. They don't want to sit under the oak tree. God give you a pastor. That's the oak tree. Sit up under that. Stop watching, listen to all these other pastors this and that. Then you go back and compare. This pastor said that, that pastor said, "Sit up under your oak tree. [Music] [Applause] [Music] a little bit harder. He set up under the ministry of Elijah. Yes, sir. And he saw so much done to win. Elijah was ready to move on. He said, "Hey, I got the cross over here. You stay here." He say, "As thy soul liveth and the Lord liveth, I will not leave thee." Then they crossed over. Then they went to Bethl I believe and he said I got to go over here and go to this. He said as thy soul liveth and the Lord liveth I will not leave. Then they crossed over. But this is the challenge. They got the Jordan. [Applause] Jordan represents death. If you want to see God and move in your life, you got to die. Die to your ways. Die to your thoughts, die to your personal feelings. Amen. But the biggest thing we got to die to is our past. [Applause] Speak, Lord. I remember when I was at so and so church, we just You ain't at so and so church. [Applause] I remember when the devil so and so stop remembering what the devil did. Let those unbelieving thoughts follow you. Tell the devil stop following me. [Music] Hallelujah. I'm stepping on new ground. Hallelujah. But church, here we are. We're here. Hallelujah. We're at that spot where we should see the mantle changing. Amen. Amen. But I love what Elijah say. He said, "Hey, you've been following me this long." They crossed over Jordan. He went over Jordan. He was willing to die. Uhhuh. Hallelujah. Every administration change has to come through a death. Hallelujah. So he crossed over. Remember before Moses Hallelujah. Before Joshua got the fullness of Moses ministry, he had to cross two. Amen. Hallelujah. So church, you can see the acceptance of moving forth with Elijah's ministry. Hallelujah. My brother takes a death. See, I don't know about you guys, but when I see God do something in in in the prophet's life, I believe I can do it, too. If I need it. If I need it. Amen. I believe if I need it, God can give me $100,000. [Music] See, I didn't put that out there now. Hallelujah. I believe God can do it. [Applause] But look, church, he says, he says, he cross over. He said, "Hey, tell me what you want." Uhhuh. See, we're not just following the prophet to be following him. There's something I want. There's something I want. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He said, "What do you want?" He said, "Hey, I want a double portion." [Applause] He He didn't even ask for the mantle. People want Brother Brandham's hat. They want the buck be. They want a bullet. Elisha didn't even ask for the mantle. He said, "I want a double portion of thy spirit." He said, "I want that spirit that's on you. I want the spirit. A hat ain't going to do me no good. A Eagle's B ain't going to do me no good. A trip to Jeffersonville ain't going to do me no good. Going to the grave ain't going to do me no good. [Applause] I want that spirit. I want that life. Yes sir. That demons are subject to sir. Yes sir. Yes sir. Brother Bernard will cast out demons. They come in the room and wake him up. He say that oh that's just you. And he turn back over and go to sleep. [Applause] Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Demons would call him out before he even say we know who thou art. [Music] Who else did they do that to? Jesus. Not just Jesus, Paul. The bride of Christ. See, they loop the spirit that was in Paul with the same spirit of Jesus. What should be happening to us? [Applause] Prophecy will find you, but you need to be the manifestation of the prophecy. Listen, Elisha says, everybody, all right, I'm about to close. Elijah says, "Hey, if you see me when I'm gone, that's what he said." That's the key. Uhhuh. When I'm gone, let the flesh go. That's it. That's right. That's it. Let the flesh go. He said, "If you see me when I'm gone, you have what you ask for." That's right. He said first, he said, "You ask a hard thing." He said, "You ask a hard thing, but if you see me when I'm gone, you have what you ask for." So, he stayed close to that word. He stayed close to that prophet. Don't let people pull you away from this message. Talking about I don't see it in the Bible. You better ask God for understanding. This message is in your Bible. [Applause] Like you try to tell women about wearing pants. Still got a little bit of pants suits in here. They said, "Well, where well the Bible the Bible don't say pants. It say garments pertaining to a man." When was the last time you seen your husband in a dress? Those not his garments. His garments are pants. Slacks. Hallelujah. See, don't get caught up in all this foolishness talking about I don't see it in the Bible. That's the devil talking to you. He said if you see me when I'm gone. He stayed close. He stayed so close to what the prophet was doing that fire had to separate them. That's right. Fire came and separated them. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And the chariots gathered him up and took him up. Hallelujah. He threw the mantle back. Hallelujah. What was the mantle? The mantle was the anointing of Christ. Amen. Cuz that's what he asked for a double portion. Hallelujah. But he grabbed the mantel, put it on, then he went and walked back to the same waters, took it off, and all he could do was operate in what he saw. He operated in what he believed. All we could do is operate in what we read. Hallelujah. He took the mantle off. He said, "Where be the God of Elijah smoke the waters and the waters move. [Applause] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. This message will work the exact same way. I know of a sister whose husband had uh epileptic fits and a and and a pastor that was preaching for them. She came in the prayer line and she told the story but said my husband he just get all messed up and all you know when he had them fits. You know what he did? He said there was a woman just like you brother Brandham talked about. He said what I want you to do is take his shirt off and go burn it. She didn't have a fireplace but she took it and burned it. And that was the last time he had her feet again. This message is true. Come musicians, I'm closing. This Bible is true. The word of God still works. Prophecy will find you. You will fulfill the good. Or you will fulfill the bad. It's up to you to decide. Cuz remember, there had to be somebody to betray Jesus. Judas fulfilled his part of prophecy. That's exactly right. That's exactly right. That's where you don't want to be. But you're fulfilling the bad. We want to take this word and walk in it. The reason why people are having problems with the message is because they're trying to make it too much flesh. Amen. We walk in the spirit as he's in the spirit. The Bible says if that spirit that raised him up from the dead Yes, sir. dwells in you, it'll quicken your mortal body. The spirit, that's what it's about. Hallelujah. This message deals with the spirit, man. Hallelujah. Yes. This message came to show us that Genesis 1:26 and Genesis 2:7 were two different things that took place sir. Yes, sir. To the same person. Hallelujah. One was for the spirit of man and one was for the flesh of man. Hallelujah. So church, we have to watch and be careful what we read. Hallelujah. and what we hear because prophecy will find you. That's right. Remember the Bible says when you reject truth, you become what? Reprobate. Giving yourself over to itch and ears. Yes sir. Yes sir. But never fully coming into the knowledge of the truth. Ever learning. Ever learning. Ever. You know, I've heard people say, "Man, I left a message and I've never been this free. Oh man, I'm just I'm just so free now. You know why they free? Cuz they don't have to be a hypocrite no more. That's why they free. That's it. They can go do all the filth they want to do. Hallelujah. That's why they free. It ain't the word that made them free. Oh my. I'm just experiencing new levels in God. Trust me, God ain't with you while you on the beach in a bikini. [Applause] He ain't getting no pleasure out of that. Young sisters, I tell you, if you you talking to a young man, he talking about send me some pictures. Come on, brother. Send me Send me some pictures. You really love me. Send me some pictures. Come on, brother. You know you you know we going we going to get married, but I need to I need to know what I'm working with. Send me some pictures if you love me. You know what you ought to do? And then text him and say, "Did you get it? Did you get who I am?" Yes, sir. Did you see me in there? Yes, sir. Did you see me in there? That's who I am. I'm the word for my day. I'm the manifestation of this hour. Hallelujah. I'm Christ revealed in the flesh. Let's pray. [Music] [Applause] [Music] You are great. You do miracles so great. There is no one else like you. There is no one else like you. You are great. You are great. You do mirales so great. There is no one else like you. [Music] There is no one else like you. You are great, so great. Your miracle so great. There is no one else like you. [Music] There is no one else like you, Lord Jesus. Father, we thank you for your word, Lord. Lord, and we give you all the honor, all the glory, all the praise. For what good would it be for us to preach or go through the scriptures, talk about the message, and you not to be here to vindicate it? So Lord, we pray Lord that the leading of the spirit will continue to guide us. Father, go with us, Lord, in this as we leave this place, Lord. Father, we just pray, Lord, for a a a greater yielding in our lives to the things of truth, Lord God, and a binding of things that are false, Lord, help us to be careful how we hear and what we read and what we see, Lord, that we will always look for the truth in everything that we do. Lord, bless you. Bless his church, Lord, and the pastor, his his wife, his children, Lord, his church family, and all those connected. In the wonderful name of Jesus Christ, we pray the church. Amen. There is no one else like you. You are so great so great. There is no one else like you. There is no one else like you. One more time. You are great. You do so great. There is no one else like you. There is no one else like you. You are great. You do miracles. So great. There is no one else like you. There is no one else like you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let's give him a clap offering tonight. [Applause] [Music] Amen. Amen. What a message tonight. Amen. Prophecy will find you. Amen. During the last eight years, how many prophecies has been fulfilled concerning this message? Amen. It is telling you one of this day if you play in church, you will come here yourself. You will find a song leader. He's not here. You will call me, my phone will be ringing. I won't be here. Amen. Prophecy is going one after the other. Prophecy is finding Trump. It's finding Biden. It's finding the Pope. It's finding Camala. It's finding all these people. What do you think about your life? And if your life doesn't terry with the gospel and prophecy cannot still find you despite all the evidences that we still have, you still struggling with the world. Watch which side of the prophecy you are fulfilling because either you going to fulfill the good prophecy or you will fulfill the bad prophecy. But if you find yourself fulfilling what is bad, you need to run quickly back to the altar and make sure your life is center. Church time are very bad. Things that are happening all around us are very bad. They say we're going to make America great. It's not working. It is going all down and things are getting into a mess and it's all mess around. I don't know what type of world do you want to live again here. But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord. Amen. And because we going through this last push of the brother, we have to tighten very hard to the word. Because at this point, I can't play because we are in the last ride. Amen. We are no more back there. We are very at the end. So this is the last time we need to use the last energy. So I have zero tolerance. I was talking I mean I was talking to a pastor tonight. I mean uh who day I spoke to him I say I have zero tolerance with the word of God. Either we are here for the message of the hour or we not here for the message of the hour because when I see prophecy it should scare you. It should bring you to look at who where where am I at? Okay. The pope now is revealed. The whole world knows about the pope. Okay. If you put a picture of the pope, you ask a message believer, they will tell you this is the pope from America. They know. If we put your picture, what do you tell people about? If we put your posting, what does people look about your posting? Or they still see worthiness? They still see craziness. Or can they look at you and they say, "This look like a god." I know this is hard, but I'm going to say it. when they look at the fourth man in the fire. Nebuchadnezzar, he didn't have a previous picture of God because if I have a picture of brother Khala, the day I will see him, I will say this is brother Khala because I have a previous picture. That was the first time hidden seen God. But when they see God, they recognize that that man look like a son of God. Can they look at you and see and say this is a man of God. This is a different person right here. The purpose is already been known. But can they reveal? What can you reveal to the world? Amen. When you taking your picture, you posting it. What does people see? A son of God or somebody who's self-promoting himself or somebody who want to show up something or are they looking at the son of God? They say there is something godly about this person. When you look at this picture, what do you see? What do you see in this picture? Do you see foolish nation? Prophecy will find you. Check your life. Examine your life. We're not going to temper with the word. We are staying right straight because I'm going to the It's like I'm trying to land the airplane. I can't play no game because game I'm going to kill people. I don't I will I was not prepared to kill people. I was prepared to pre to to to to get you all the way to the rapture. So there is no game at this point. Are we together? Are we together? Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we are approaching you humbly tonight, Lord. Father, thanking you for your grace, for your love and your mercy, and for everything you have been doing for us. Lord, it becames like a trend in the message. When a prophecy happen, people get all excited. Everybody want to post it on the social media to make sure they also are part of those that are posting and all it takes is few weeks and all the the excitement about the prophecy will be gone and then we are going back again acting foolishly and going back to everything that we were doing. And father, another prophecy will come as a wakeup call. And we do the same thing until it goes over and over. And we got used to the fulfillment of prophecy until it's not even shaking us a bit. Father, may you be merciful to your bride. May you be merciful to your children. May this sermon preached tonight be a wakeup call that we will look no more at the pope. No more following what the pope is doing, whatever he's going, where he's going. We already know that's the pope. We already know the pope is manifested. We don't have to go through the detail of the pope. Now, let's look at the detail of what the bride is supposed to fulfill. What am I supposed to do in this time? Let's focus on that one, Lord. Father, let's make sure everything is reflecting you so that we can be a living Bible that people can read and see and say, "Truly, this man was a son of God. Truly this woman was a daughter of God. Father I pray in the name of Jesus Christ that you come and help your children. Remove everyone Lord Father from everyone. Every demonic spirit of wilderness of uh of worldliness everything that has been besetting the sin that easily come Lord. Father remove it from this church in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. That's right. Lord, give us travel mercy and consecrate us if you tell it to come. So that when we meet again, Lord, Father, we be fresh under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit to gather again about the things of the kingdom. Lord, I pray, Lord, Father, that you touch Brother Digs. Lord, strengthen him, Lord Father. Give him travel mercy, Lord Father, and look at all the sacrifices he's doing for the kingdom of God. May you reward him and his family. We thank you and commit everything unto thy hand in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Go ahead. Amen.
