========================================

you won't mind if he goes he said would you don't mean to tell me you got low enough down do you have to carry a preacher with you wherever you go and so he said well I said and I thought about time me get out I got out of the car and walked around the side and I said how do you do and Mr. Wood was going to introduce me before he had time to do it and all whiskers two weeks long and squirrel blooded stank like a pcat. So I I started around there and I said, "How do you do, sir?" &gt;&gt; He said, "And you're a preacher." I said, "Well, &gt;&gt; I'd like to be." And he said, "Well, I just, you know," he said, "I'm supposed to be an infidel." I said, "Not much to brag about, is it, sir?" He said, he said, "No, I reckon it's not." He said, "It's just one thing that I got against you fellas." And I said, "Yes, sir. It's just one thing that you're pretty good shape." Some of them I met I got a lot of Christians that supposed to be got more than that against me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I said I said well that's that's pretty good. He said what I got against you guys is this. You're always hollering about something that you know nothing about. I said for instance what sir? And he said you're talking about God and there is no such a thing. Oh, I said, "That's what it is." He said, "Yeah, that's it." Oh, Lord, you help me. Now, there are just two ways to approach anything, my brethren. That's the right way and the wrong way. &gt;&gt; I think, may I stop here a moment in my story and say, I think that's what's the matter with me and many of us, brethren. We got a great product here, but we're approaching the public wrong with it too much. &gt;&gt; Making us isolationist. &gt;&gt; It'll sell itself. &gt;&gt; Just live. You're the salt of the earth. &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right. &gt;&gt; And salt, as long as the savior's in the salt, it'll save if it contacts. But if it's lost its savior, no matter how loud we shout down here and how much we jump up and down, there's got to be a life out here that backs fed up. &gt;&gt; So I looked at the old gentleman and I thought, Lord, poor old fella hammer around on these old clouds here. My daddy would live that about that age. Now there's just a little something here that you could help me to say. No doubt that it helped the old fella to see. And I've seen many that call themselves infidels. And I've stood by some of them when they were going. They're not infidels. They're just popping off. And so that's a street expression, but that's way you'll understand it. Popping off and uh letting off steam. And I said, "Well, it's of course I said that's the pinion, of course." And we stood there a moment and we were sitting under an apple tree. He said, "I've been to them meetings and they're just like a lion dog." He said, "I used to have an old lion dog and I shot him." He said, "I'd follow him every night, take him out here, and he'd be barking and go up there and he's supposed to be a dog." And said, "The would be up the tree." And said, "Then the first thing you know, he'd be barking up this tree like that and I go around there and shine the light all up. The had done went out through the top." I said, "But sir, after all, the was there. It's just a dog." I hope he got what I meant. I'm sure you do. So, he said, "Um, so I shot him." And he said, "Uh, I don't I don't like anything that'll lie. I think if a man talks, you already know what he's talking about." I said, "I certainly agree with you." He said, "There was one preacher that I heard that if I ever get to see the man, but I never heard him, but I heard of him. If I ever get to see the man, I'm going to hear him." And I said, "That's very nice." He said he come to a little place over here called Actton at the Methodist campground. And brother Woods looked at me and shut me. He said, "Old sister so and so up on the hill here. I forget her. Never call her sister. Miss somebody is about 65. Said she was dying with cancer in the stomach." And said she had doctors out of Louisville here and said they got a nice farm up there and said they could afford it. They took her up to Louisville for an operation that knew one bit of good. cut her open, sewed her up. Cancer done wrapped her all through. Said she gradually died here for several months. Said finally got to a place that she is so bad. And I, excuse me, my brother, sister said they I'm just going to express it the way he said it. She couldn't even get onto the bed pan. They could never put one under. They couldn't raise her that high. They had to use a draw sheet, rubber sheet, and a draw sheet. said wife and I went up there every morning and would change her wife change her bed and I'd help get the sheets out from under and so forth and said she just the doctor said just give her a little uh morphine or something to keep her as easy as possible until she died said she had about two weeks to live and he said um they come a preacher down here from Indiana and had over here at the Methodist campground he said this uh several hundreds of people gathered over there. They said, "Do you hear this preacher?" And he said, "Um, and that night said while he was preaching said her sister was sitting back there, which is Mrs. So and so it lives over here on another ridge." And said this preacher was supposed to have something another that he could uh uh tell the people about uh what they had done and why they were sick and all about that. and said I'd heard about it because of course I didn't believe such a radical thing is that and uh he said but however this woman that night was sitting in the meeting and while the minister was speaking he turns to this woman and her sitting in the back of the building and said when you left home tonight back there miss so and so said you picked up a little blue h or little handkerchief with a blue figure in the corner of it off of the dresser and you put it in your purse and said, "Uh, you're praying back there for your older sister who's dying by the name of so and so that lives over here on the hill." Said, "The Lord has heard your prayers. Now take this little handkerchief and lay it upon your sister and the cancer will leave her." was said about round close to midnight that night. I thought they had the Salvation Army on the hillside up there. All the screaming and hollering. I don't want to embarrass anybody, but that was Ben. Brother Ben, you know that familiar squall of an amen he gives out every night in the meeting down there that shakes the place. Brother Ben had took the woman up there her to her sister and had laid the handkip on her and Ben believed it. So he just started shouting before it happened. So he was just getting at it first. So brother Ben he said I thought the woman had died. Well said it was around midnight. So the next morning said the wife and I went up there and said you know what said that woman was up cooking her breakfast eating fried apple pie. How many of you rebels know what a fried apple pie is? Oh my, do I love them? I like them to put molasses on them. See, and I I I'm not a Methodist. I'm a Baptist. I like to baptize them with molasses, you know, put plenty of them, then eat them hot butter. And so then when uh she was eating these fried apple pies and said it really like to tuck wife and I off our feet and said, And if you don't believe that point is [Music] You only know and you see through eyes and love [Music] and you'll deep. If not for grace, [Music] where would I be? You only know. [Music] I'm glad you see through my love. I was so and [Music] I grabbed [Music] how sweet.

Father, we first pray, Lord God, for those, Lord, that are standing in perilous times, Lord, in situations, Father, that only you can touch, Lord God. And Father, I pray that you remember our precious sister Edie, Lord God, and her family, Lord. You know, how would we feel, Lord, if it was our mother, Lord? If it was our loved one, Lord, going through such a time, Lord, help us to truly put ourselves in that place, Lord God, and truly cry out for strength, Lord God. uh whatever your divine will and purpose desires to express, Lord God.

We got a quick testimony real quick. God bless you, Saints. I just have a quick testimony about something that happened to me yesterday. Um, so I was working and me and Lily have been wanting to get an air purification system in our HVAC system because we have bad allergies and dust problems living out in the country. So, um, it's about $400 to get this part through the company that I work for. Um, so I was planning on getting it this next upcoming week, next time I went to the shop. And so I called one of my co-workers yesterday. I was working. And uh, I told him about how I was wanting to get it and, you know, when I was going to get it and everything. And he was like, "Oh man, don't even worry about it." He was like, "I got one and I'm I'm not even going to have time to put it in my own house, so you can just have it for free." So that is wonderful how God is just mindful of the little things in our lives. &gt;&gt; I told you God already made a way. [Applause] &gt;&gt; We got a special this morning from Sister Lily.

That's an elder right there who lost uh if you were there in brother Kelly's 50th birthday, Sister Anderson was there. She even spoke. She even sung. But we know one thing as a believer, she's in a good place. She's in a better place than where we are right now. Amen. So, keep the church and the family in prayer. We wait to see how the program will come out and then we go from there. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then our married couple meeting part 8 will be on December the 13th and um uh finances part two when a believer especially somebody who believe the message like that goes away. I know in the body it hurt but we should be joyful &gt;&gt; because we know that we have not lost her &gt;&gt; and all it takes is a matter of time.

Just keep in prayer and do what you can do. And by God's grace, he started the work. He's not just alpha. He's alpha and he's also omega. The problem is for God to start something. Once God have already started, that's it. The remaining God will take care of it. Amen. Since it's God who started the building, then God will take care of the building.

When my life is completely different than your life, you have more freedom. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't I have to constantly stay prayed up and stay u meditating and everything even where I am at always you on the look for something because you don't know when the Holy Spirit speak to you about someone or about a sermon you got to be quick to open your phone and write down quickly what he's saying and and and sometime you're driving then it comes and then you got to get it quickly and then all of that or call somebody or do this so my life is completely different from yours. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So don't expect me to be like you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And don't put pressure on me. &gt;&gt; Because it require a lot. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I mean unless you are a joker as a pastor, then you can do whatever you want to do.

But take care of the flock of God. &gt;&gt; Not according to your intelligence, &gt;&gt; according to the word of God and the message of the hour. Because the people don't come to hear you. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; they want to hear what God is saying. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Even in the counseling, they need to hear what God want to tell them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, you need to make sure you are connected with God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah.

Heavenly Father, Lord, we are approaching you humbly this morning. Father, thanking you for your grace, your love, your mercy, and for everything you have been doing for us. Father, this is as far as I can go with the ability you have given me as a human being, Lord. But when it comes to ministering to your children, visible and invisible, you only take the supernatural action of the Holy Spirit. Lord, I pray that you move me completely out of the way. May you come down in the power of resurrection Lord and may Lord Father you speak to us so and bless us and give us what is needed for our life journey while we still waiting for the coming of the Lord. We thank you for the song of Zion for your presence being here for Lord touching Lord filling and already working before the word even be proclaimed. Lord, we thank you for everything because when your presence is there, it makes a big difference. Lord, be the alpha and the omega of this service in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Genesis chapter 37. My subject this morning is our life journey through Joseph five garment part 83. 8 eternity three perfection 83. Amen. &gt;&gt; My theme if we will get there because last Sunday you did good. Congratulations spoken word. You move a little bit beforeward. Praise God. Is divine instruction. [Laughter] That's why I give your children good name. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; You want me You You need a quote for that. &gt;&gt; Do you need a quote for that? &gt;&gt; Divine instructions. [Music] divine instructions for season &gt;&gt; because now you know how to decode season even when everything looks bad. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. I will leave that alone. Genesis 37 verse7. If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know very well this story. We already elaborated a lot on that. I'm going to touch the surface because we're moving somewhere. &gt;&gt; Verse seven, the Bible say, "For behold," this is Joseph telling the dream, "we were binding sheav in the field." Which field &gt;&gt; and where? &gt;&gt; We don't know. According to them, maybe the dream he was seeing because they were going to the field. Maybe the field he saw was where they usually work with his brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He say we for behold we were binding sheavs in the field and lo my sheath arose and also stood upright and behold your sheavs stood round about. What a declaration. and made obedience to my sheath. &gt;&gt; Selfexplanatory. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, everybody is identified by a sheath. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Is that a problem? &gt;&gt; A sheath represent a person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And a sheath is a a it's a it's a it's a bundle. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; of wheat. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We already pray. It's many wheat &gt;&gt; that are put together. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it become a sheath. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And a sheath is a person. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did you sleep good? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A she right here. Joseph has his own sheath. His brother has the own sheath. &gt;&gt; Amen. And a sheath represented a person. &gt;&gt; You know the wave sheath. &gt;&gt; The wave sheath is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Should I preach on that back again? &gt;&gt; The wave she chief is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; A sheath represent a person. &gt;&gt; But a she is a bundle of wheat. &gt;&gt; Amen. You all watch cartoons &gt;&gt; because if I say movie will be strong. You watch Joseph's cartoon. &gt;&gt; Make a major this morning. Right. &gt;&gt; Something like this. It's called a sheath. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it's a bundle of wheat. &gt;&gt; It makes a shift. &gt;&gt; But all of this represented a person. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the wheat there represented scriptures. &gt;&gt; Take your time, brother. Jesus is the wave chief. &gt;&gt; He's not one wheat. &gt;&gt; It's a bundle of wheat. &gt;&gt; It's a bundle of scripture. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; 100%. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Okay, let me help you up so we go easy. You are written epistles. &gt;&gt; Now, now are we together? You are scriptures. &gt;&gt; You are a bundle of promises. [Applause] &gt;&gt; When they say Luke 17:30, &gt;&gt; Malachi 4, Revelation 10:7, all of that is one person. &gt;&gt; But the person have many scripture &gt;&gt; and you also have your scripture. &gt;&gt; Take your time, Lord. &gt;&gt; Take the time, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay, let's leave the sheath. Let's me continue on my way. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you are not just what you think. You are a bundle of promises. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; When they say I will send you Elijah, &gt;&gt; I'm in I'm in there. &gt;&gt; When they say you will receive the Holy Ghost, I'm in there. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I have a scripture for the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; a scripture for a marriage, &gt;&gt; a scripture for the rapture, &gt;&gt; a scripture for finances. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I have many scripture. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I am the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's powerful. [Music] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. [Laughter] This boy is talking about his dream. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he gave his dream that he they were in the field and everybody's she were bowing down to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And his she stood up. &gt;&gt; It's a prophecy. &gt;&gt; It's a vision. The problem is where is that vision going to happen? &gt;&gt; Where &gt;&gt; which place? &gt;&gt; Which country? &gt;&gt; We don't know &gt;&gt; so far. Job to verse 8. And his brethren said to him, "Shall you indeed reign over us?" So they understood something from the vision. or shall you indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams plural &gt;&gt; and for his words, &gt;&gt; the vision, the dreams and the word caused problem. &gt;&gt; Verse nine, and he dreamed yet another dream. &gt;&gt; And told it to his brethren, and say, behold, I have dreamed a dream. I have dreamed a dream more and behold the sun and the moon, &gt;&gt; husband and wife, daddy and mommy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the 11 stars, even the one who was not born yet. &gt;&gt; Joseph was number 11. &gt;&gt; But Joseph say he's in the middle and they were 11 star. So there was a baby somewhere &gt;&gt; in heaven in the zodiac. &gt;&gt; And the zodiac is a Bible. &gt;&gt; We already went through that. &gt;&gt; So there was a baby already there. Benjamin was there. BJ, you were there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Benjamin already existed in eternity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Because Jacob at this point have only had only 11 children &gt;&gt; and Joseph was already in the middle. So 11 minus one it's 10. &gt;&gt; So where is the other 11 star? &gt;&gt; So you can read prophecy but you don't see. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; You are getting a superficial. &gt;&gt; Even Jacob miss it. What got him upset is the sun and the moon. So he say me and your mother &gt;&gt; are bowing down to you. &gt;&gt; You going too far with these things. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said the sun and the moon and the 11 stars did what? &gt;&gt; Made obeisance to me. &gt;&gt; In other words, bowing down to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where is this going to be fulfilled? We don't know. Verse 10. And he told it to his father and to his brethren. And his father rebuked him because he was there. &gt;&gt; And he was inside bowing. He didn't like the bowing. &gt;&gt; I'm your father. How should I bow down to you? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So his father rebuked him. Amen. &gt;&gt; And said to him, "What is this dream that you have dreamed?" Did he cause the dream? &gt;&gt; No. He said, "What is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall I and your mother who told you he was it was Rachel?" &gt;&gt; Because Rachel died &gt;&gt; and Rachel was never in Egypt. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Is my Bible different than your Bible? &gt;&gt; So who fulfilled this vision? Let me leave that alone. &gt;&gt; Let's let's stay on the highway. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "And your mother and your brethren indeed come to bow down ourself to you to the water." &gt;&gt; So we found out that there is there are vision concerning this boy here &gt;&gt; called Joseph. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But this vision are not just dream. &gt;&gt; They are not just vision. &gt;&gt; These vision have messages in them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I just gave you an example. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Benjamin was hidden there. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; If you look at this vision, it's talking about she and the field. &gt;&gt; But Egypt was there. &gt;&gt; That's right. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If I tell you Egypt is there, you will say, "Brother Steven, how did you decode Egypt? It's not written Egypt there." No, Egypt was there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But Egypt was not visible. &gt;&gt; What I'm trying to draw this morning is does vision require a certain environment? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Those visions. Amen. require a certain environment &gt;&gt; or a certain place &gt;&gt; or a certain country. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; A certain setting. &gt;&gt; Say sister Sharon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With certain season. Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The season connected to that place, &gt;&gt; connected to that country, &gt;&gt; connected to that setting. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For the vision to come to pass. &gt;&gt; In other words, that vision could not happen in Africa. No sir. &gt;&gt; No matter how much you pray in Africa. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That vision could not happen in America. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The vision was locked with an environment. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The vision was connected with Egypt. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Egypt has its own season. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he required this environment and the season of the environment to bring the dream to come to pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everybody okay? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we talking about a Hebrew, &gt;&gt; a Jew, an Israelite that receive instruction from God. divine uh vision for God and you trying to tell that Egypt that uh that Israelite that your vision is for Egypt the God of Israel &gt;&gt; bringing a vision &gt;&gt; and my vision the vision of my life &gt;&gt; won't be fulfilled in Jerusalem Not in the promised land. &gt;&gt; It have to be fulfilled in Egypt. &gt;&gt; Which Egypt to us represented the world, &gt;&gt; not a Christian world, &gt;&gt; a sinful word. &gt;&gt; I don't know about that interpretation. Amen. &gt;&gt; The field that I saw, it was me and my brother. &gt;&gt; We were together. &gt;&gt; Me and my brother. So probably as we grow up, when daddy will die, I will be taking things in charge and I will be the king right here. We will make a little kingdom and you guys will bow down. Mama is right here. So mommy at a certain time will bow down. &gt;&gt; We are we together. Are we I'm I'm just warming the engine before we go there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Job to verse 13. &gt;&gt; And Israel said to Joseph, "Do not your brethren feed the flock in shikim. Come, we went through this already. And I will send you to them." And he said to him, "Here I am." Wonderful boy. Verse 14. And he said to him, "Go, I pray you, see whether it be well with your brethren and well with the flocks, and bring me word again." Joseph was sent to return. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Little did he know it was his ticket. It was his flight. &gt;&gt; He thought he's going to go &gt;&gt; and come back. &gt;&gt; That was it. &gt;&gt; He was not coming back. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So this vision have this thing. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Wow. &gt;&gt; This vision of people bowing down &gt;&gt; and him reigning had this element locked in. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because those element were necessary to activate. &gt;&gt; That's correct, brother. Amen. &gt;&gt; Or to crank the vision on. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, Joseph in his mind, he said, "You know what? I'm going to go. I know she came. I'm going to arrive, see them, and then talk to them a little bit and come back. Amen. &gt;&gt; So God was preparing to take him without his will. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Because he was the only boy of his mother. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; There was no way his mother would have left him after all the years &gt;&gt; that she have waited to have a baby for this boy to go to Egypt. &gt;&gt; So God has to permit Joseph to be kidnapped. &gt;&gt; What he thought was a going and coming &gt;&gt; was only one way ticket. Jesus. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 14, he says, "And he says to him, go, I pray you, see whether he be well with your brethren, and well with the flock, and bring me word again." So he sent him out to the valley of Hebron, and he came to what? &gt;&gt; So we we probably see our brother Joseph going happy. &gt;&gt; Amen. singingh. Fly away. Oh, glory. Fly away. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not knowing he's already flying. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's going there. Hallelujah. Maybe he's on the bush. Hallelujah. Glory. He get under the anointing. Oh, he say the presence of the Lord is right here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. verse uh um 15. And a certain man found him, and behold, he was what? &gt;&gt; Wandering in the field. &gt;&gt; So, Joseph got lost. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; He got so joyful and he got lost. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He can't find his way. Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe he begin to pray, Lord God of Abraham, &gt;&gt; father, Lord of Jacob, &gt;&gt; please help me to find my way in the name of Jes I'm putting that today. In the name because Jesus name was not there revealed yet. Ah, in the name of Jehovah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Whatever you ask, believe that you receive it. &gt;&gt; Father, you going to bring me to the right path. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Please help me. So we move. &gt;&gt; Verse 15. And a certain man found him. And behold, he was wandering in the field. And the man asked him, saying, "What seek you?" &gt;&gt; And he said, "I seek my brethren. Tell me, I pray where they feed their flock." And the men say, "They are departed from here." Oh, praise the Lord. You see, you see how God work. &gt;&gt; You see how God work. So God knew I will get lost &gt;&gt; and he put a man that already seen my brother. Oh, thank you Jesus for answering my prayer. You see, God is with me. God is there. &gt;&gt; I just pray it happen. &gt;&gt; Oh, when I go home, &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell daddy the testimony. &gt;&gt; Daddy, you know what? I have a testimony to give tonight.

Brothers and sister, Jesus is alive. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I was lost in the bush of chicken. And then suddenly a stranger appeared to me and he knew the direction and he put me on the right and I found my brother. So tonight I have a testimony. That testimony is going to Egypt. [Applause] Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So here, Joseph sees God. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; He see the presence of God. &gt;&gt; The mercy of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. The on time God. &gt;&gt; A present help in the time of trouble. &gt;&gt; I was in trouble.

You see how we all responding? &gt;&gt; So was this God or the devil [Music] &gt;&gt; because of the danger God should have made him get lost and go back home. &gt;&gt; Uh now it looks like God opened up a blessing and the blessing is putting him to a trouble. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The problem was Egypt was calling. &gt;&gt; My God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Egypt and the vision were communicating. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Egypt and the vision were talking. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse uh uh uh 19.

And God called the king his servant. [Music] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me push the brake before we move forward because I need to straighten up certain things especially when I deal with message believer. Keep your finger right there. Let's go to Proverb chapter 21. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There it is. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Let's go to Proverb 21. message believer should be PhD in the Bible &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You should know your Bible more than even a Jehovah witness &gt;&gt; because you got the revelation of the Bible. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Jen uh uh proverb 21 verse1 if you there you can say amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible say the king's what &gt;&gt; the heart of the president Say amen. &gt;&gt; The heart of the president, &gt;&gt; every president, their heart, &gt;&gt; I'm trying to help you up. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to help you up. &gt;&gt; The heart of the king. &gt;&gt; Today there is only one king maybe in England, but our king I call president. &gt;&gt; The heart of the president. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; The king's heart is where? in the hand of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So the heart of the president is in the hand of who? &gt;&gt; The Lord. &gt;&gt; He didn't say that president is is a is a sent. &gt;&gt; He didn't say that president is the seed of Abraham. &gt;&gt; All he says is the heart of the president &gt;&gt; is in the hand of God. &gt;&gt; That's why God could harden Pharaoh. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. church. Are we together? Yes, &gt;&gt; ma'am. Yes, ma'am. &gt;&gt; Brother Tony, sit back there and shoot a man from that corner. &gt;&gt; So, I need to hear fire coming up from this way. Amen. That's why God could harden the heart of Pharaoh and liberate the heart as he will. &gt;&gt; So, if you come and Pharaoh say no, God is the one turning it off &gt;&gt; and God is the one turning that off. That's why don't seek the favor of men. &gt;&gt; Seek the favor of God &gt;&gt; because God is the one in control of everything. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Don't beg any man. Beg God. &gt;&gt; Worship God. &gt;&gt; Don't sugar anybody. [Music] &gt;&gt; Sugar body God. Worship him. Exalt him. Adore him. magnify him because he's the one that control everybody. &gt;&gt; He's controlling Donald Trump. &gt;&gt; Yes, he is.

[Music] [Applause] Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When Nebuchadnezzar is carrying people to Israel, God say it's my servant. &gt;&gt; And you over there, you are praising Nebuchadnezzar. There is a big king. He's so mighty. &gt;&gt; He's so powerful. &gt;&gt; He's winning every battle he's going. &gt;&gt; It was not Nebuchadnezzar winning. It was not the strength of the calin. It was God who already established &gt;&gt; that I'm going to make Nebuchadnezzar do this. &gt;&gt; We clear so far. &gt;&gt; We clear so far. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we clear? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we're trying to understand when we say Nebuchadnezzar, the servant of the Lord. So the captivity of Israel was with a king &gt;&gt; by the name of Nebuchadnezzar, &gt;&gt; a hidden king and yet a servant of the Lord. Let's go to the book of Daniel. &gt;&gt; Please give me my time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm reading my third scripture &gt;&gt; and I'm just explaining the third scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen.

Because in Joshua the pillar of fire became a man. &gt;&gt; Both manifestation in Babylon. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Verse 25. And then King Das after Daniel came from the lion's den to he said he did what? Wrote to all people and what &gt;&gt; nations &gt;&gt; and what languages &gt;&gt; because you know through the image after the Babylonian the middle Persian came.

I make a decree that in every dominion of my kingdom, men tremble and do what?" &gt;&gt; And fear &gt;&gt; before who? &gt;&gt; The God of Daniel. &gt;&gt; So this this king that you know from history &gt;&gt; believed the God of Daniel. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You you don't want to swallow that yet. He says and he says before the God of Daniel for he is the living God. &gt;&gt; So the so the riots believe the God of Daniel. &gt;&gt; That's why major came to worship Jesus Christ because of Daniel. &gt;&gt; Daniel preach in the gentile. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; He says the God of Daniel for he is the living God.

Brother Brandham say now Jesus say in the word he said that if you do water &gt;&gt; ask the father anything in my name &gt;&gt; he shall water &gt;&gt; I'll do it &gt;&gt; but sometime when God performs something and does something that we ask for yet we don't it comes how &gt;&gt; in unexpected way &gt;&gt; come and sometime in what &gt;&gt; in an unexpected place &gt;&gt; come and where &gt;&gt; at an unexpected time &gt;&gt; unexpected way &gt;&gt; unexpected place &gt;&gt; Egypt Babylon &gt;&gt; an unexpected time &gt;&gt; I hope we are together &gt;&gt; brother Brandham say but God will answer in his own &gt;&gt; way &gt;&gt; if you just what &gt;&gt; believe it &gt;&gt; brother Brandham continue he says what &gt;&gt; think of it &gt;&gt; so sometime we think because what &gt;&gt; we're 35 &gt;&gt; or what &gt;&gt; or 40 &gt;&gt; or what &gt;&gt; whatever you are &gt;&gt; you are never too old [Applause] Because we give our own retirement ourselves. &gt;&gt; Who told you you retired? &gt;&gt; When did Caleb retired? &gt;&gt; When did Caleb retired? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Retirement means what? &gt;&gt; Sit down and do nothing. That's what we have there. &gt;&gt; Because when we say retire and retirement, all of us are looking at going home and sit down. You wake up in the morning and drink coffee. You will do that for two weeks and you get tired and you become bored. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say you are what? &gt;&gt; Never too old. &gt;&gt; You got the soul that got to leave how &gt;&gt; forever.

Brother Bradam say we have a what &gt;&gt; an unusual subject tonight &gt;&gt; and God is how &gt;&gt; unusual. You who know God &gt;&gt; because now you realize God was in &gt;&gt; Abuchanza. &gt;&gt; You realize God was in Sy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Unusual. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Your God is what? &gt;&gt; Unusual. &gt;&gt; Unusual. And he does what? &gt;&gt; Unusual things. &gt;&gt; Not in his own way. &gt;&gt; Not unusual to him. But in our way of what? &gt;&gt; Thinking. &gt;&gt; It is not unusual to God. It is unusual to us &gt;&gt; because of religion. &gt;&gt; And the way we were taught before. &gt;&gt; That's right. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Brother Brown. I'm saying now this is rather a what? &gt;&gt; An unusual scene &gt;&gt; and what? &gt;&gt; An unusual test. &gt;&gt; But you know God is how &gt;&gt; unusual. &gt;&gt; God does things how? &gt;&gt; In an unusual way. &gt;&gt; And what? &gt;&gt; In an unusual time. &gt;&gt; And what? &gt;&gt; In an unusual place. And sometime to what? &gt;&gt; Unusual people. &gt;&gt; So God is what? &gt;&gt; Unusual. &gt;&gt; He does the unexpected many times. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm still dropping this down. &gt;&gt; Brother Brown continue. He said this is rather a what? &gt;&gt; An unusual scripture. &gt;&gt; But you know God is how &gt;&gt; unusual. &gt;&gt; And he does things how &gt;&gt; in an unusual way. &gt;&gt; And so we can just expect what &gt;&gt; the unusual &gt;&gt; when we are dealing with what? &gt;&gt; God. You didn't get me well. &gt;&gt; I have repeated four codes &gt;&gt; to show you four or three code to show you that God is unusual. &gt;&gt; In other words, when you dealing with this God, &gt;&gt; the God of this message, &gt;&gt; this God here, &gt;&gt; you need to open up your mind &gt;&gt; because God is an unusual God. [Music] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me well. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In other words, &gt;&gt; the way God operate, &gt;&gt; it will be not working according to your thinking. &gt;&gt; So don't put God in a box. &gt;&gt; Let him be God. &gt;&gt; If he come this way, it's God. &gt;&gt; This way it's God. This way it's God. Even if he come this way, [Applause] Because God is unusual. &gt;&gt; God woke on King Nebuchadnezzar. &gt;&gt; Can I continue? &gt;&gt; Can I continue? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "That is where God &gt;&gt; dwells." &gt;&gt; He dwells where? &gt;&gt; In the unusual. &gt;&gt; When you see things funny, &gt;&gt; be careful. Amen. &gt;&gt; My brother betray me. Be careful. &gt;&gt; It could be the beginning of your journey. &gt;&gt; It could be the beginning of your deliverance. &gt;&gt; It could be the beginning of your season. &gt;&gt; The beginning of a new start, but it happened in an unusual way, &gt;&gt; in the way you didn't expect. &gt;&gt; But it's God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God knew &gt;&gt; God knew all of us &gt;&gt; that if he would have given us our own choice &gt;&gt; in the churches that we were before spoken word, none of us would have left [Applause] &gt;&gt; because we love the pastor so much. Our human love &gt;&gt; became more than a divine love &gt;&gt; until when the pastor was deviating. We were still there &gt;&gt; being cooked like frogs, &gt;&gt; slowly frying us. &gt;&gt; So God moved &gt;&gt; in an unusual way and open up a demon &gt;&gt; to reject the message so you can come out &gt;&gt; from where you are. And when you came out, it was another season. &gt;&gt; It was another church. It was another moving of the Holy Spirit. Look where you are today. He was God in an unusual way. [Music] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Joseph went to Egypt with a lot of tears. We left the church with a lot of regret, &gt;&gt; a lot of tears. I never thought something like this will have happened. &gt;&gt; Ah, God said that is good because that's the only way I can get you where I want you to be. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; To gain you. It took a preacher to backslid &gt;&gt; to gain you. It took a big preacher to backslid. So who are you? [Applause] &gt;&gt; What is in you? [Applause] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. God have to liquidate &gt;&gt; a preacher just because of you. &gt;&gt; A well-known preacher because of you. So what is in you? [Applause] [Music] Are we together? &gt;&gt; Many people are sitting in dead message churches because of human family ability because of family problem because of family connection and the children are dying and people are dying. That's why God put a fire &gt;&gt; so you can make a decision. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; You who are still staying where your children are dying. &gt;&gt; Every child in the church is already committing fornication and you still hanging on there because of old friendship. Your fire is coming. &gt;&gt; Your fire is coming. Put me online. Your fire is coming. &gt;&gt; God is going to shake you. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What do you regret today? [Music] What do you regret today? &gt;&gt; Did you see that at the beginning? &gt;&gt; Because your God dwell in unusual. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Now I'm sowing like an eagle, my friend. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm sowing now like an eagle because I know my God is an unusual God. So I must be expecting the unusual. When it's unusual, it is the territory of God. A virgin shall conceive. It's unusual. That's his territory. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God dwells where &gt;&gt; in the unusual &gt;&gt; in the what? &gt;&gt; Unusual &gt;&gt; to the what? &gt;&gt; Carnal mind. &gt;&gt; You remember brother Tony &gt;&gt; he says but those who believe him to be what? &gt;&gt; The same yesterday, today and forever. &gt;&gt; All things are what? &gt;&gt; Possible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every word that he promised will be what? &gt;&gt; Fulfilled. &gt;&gt; It is the what? &gt;&gt; Unusual things &gt;&gt; that makes him God. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] Not the usual thing, &gt;&gt; the unusual thing. &gt;&gt; That is what makes him God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He say he goes to the what? &gt;&gt; Unusual. &gt;&gt; He makes everything what? &gt;&gt; Unusual to the people. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. All right. And we are living in what? &gt;&gt; An unusual day. &gt;&gt; And what? &gt;&gt; An unusual time. &gt;&gt; But we are serving the God that has been where &gt;&gt; in all times. [Applause] You are living in which day? &gt;&gt; Unusual day. &gt;&gt; And a what? &gt;&gt; Unusual time. &gt;&gt; And your God is how? &gt;&gt; Been in all times. &gt;&gt; No. And your God unusual. Your God is how? &gt;&gt; Unusual. &gt;&gt; And you are living how? &gt;&gt; Unusual day. &gt;&gt; And what? &gt;&gt; An unusual time. &gt;&gt; So unusual and unusual match together. &gt;&gt; In other words, this is God's time. &gt;&gt; The condition is for God. Oh, glory to God. Brother Brandham says this is he say very what &gt;&gt; unusual &gt;&gt; but you know sometime it is what &gt;&gt; unusual things &gt;&gt; that that's what &gt;&gt; that God appears in &gt;&gt; God appear in the water &gt;&gt; unusual because God is unusual &gt;&gt; he does what &gt;&gt; unusual things &gt;&gt; he's appear what &gt;&gt; at unusual time &gt;&gt; and he's seen where &gt;&gt; at unusual times &gt;&gt; when times you would not think that he would &gt;&gt; he be there &gt;&gt; and yet he is there. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] [Applause] sir &gt;&gt; in the time you thought &gt;&gt; you wouldn't you didn't know he was already there &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; brother Brandham say he works what &gt;&gt; in mysterious ways &gt;&gt; this wonder to what &gt;&gt; to perform &gt;&gt; therefore that makes him have &gt;&gt; unusual &gt;&gt; that is the way we get into what &gt;&gt; a usual trend of things &gt;&gt; and we miss God &gt;&gt; it's the unusual that brings God many times &gt;&gt; the what &gt;&gt; unusual things &gt;&gt; something we get so tied up &gt;&gt; in a certain &gt;&gt; or something that we are trying to do what &gt;&gt; serve &gt;&gt; and then if everything doesn't come just according to the way we think it should we do what &gt;&gt; offset it &gt;&gt; and it's all it's not of God we make a what &gt;&gt; a mighty mistake &gt;&gt; sir take your time right there &gt;&gt; take your thinking The way you think should things should come in your life &gt;&gt; and the way you think she think should be happening in your life. The way you think your husband should come &gt;&gt; or your wife should come &gt;&gt; or how he should be married. Remove that from you because your husband will come in an unusual way, &gt;&gt; unusual time. She said, "Okay how did your husband came &gt;&gt; in a in a usual way? [Applause] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your wife will come in an unusual time. &gt;&gt; In an unusual way &gt;&gt; and it's God. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Jeremiah 24. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm reading my third scripture. &gt;&gt; Then we start preaching. &gt;&gt; Are we there? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You heard the head deacon say, "That's right." &gt;&gt; Let's go, my friend. The Lord showed me and behold what? &gt;&gt; Two baskets of figs &gt;&gt; were set before the temple of the Lord. After that who &gt;&gt; Nebuchadnezzar &gt;&gt; who &gt;&gt; king of Babylon &gt;&gt; had carried away away captive who &gt;&gt; Jeaniah &gt;&gt; it's on the board the son of Jehoakim &gt;&gt; h king of Judah and the princes of who? &gt;&gt; Judah &gt;&gt; with the carpenter and the what? &gt;&gt; And smiths &gt;&gt; from Jerusalem and have brought them to what? &gt;&gt; Babylon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; These people are brought to Babylon. &gt;&gt; And brother Steven, you just demonstrated that Babylon to Persia God was there. He was the beginning of the exile &gt;&gt; or the ex the the the the captivity all the way to the end of the captivity because he's alpha and omega. &gt;&gt; So he hold the beginning and the end. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; But the problem is he took them in Babylon. &gt;&gt; What does Babylon have to do with us today? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? In the book of Revelation 17, we went through this all along. &gt;&gt; We found out that there was a woman, &gt;&gt; you know this a wrong &gt;&gt; that was sitting on the beast &gt;&gt; and the beast have seven head. &gt;&gt; And the Bible say the seven head were the seven mountain. &gt;&gt; We already went through this. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that woman was called mystery what? &gt;&gt; Babylon. &gt;&gt; So Babylon exists today in the name of Rome. [Applause] [Music] I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says in the message the second seal in paragraph 303 he says anybody knows that what &gt;&gt; Babylon &gt;&gt; is what? wrong &gt;&gt; because there is only one church that sits on seven hill &gt;&gt; and it's in the Vatican and that church is the Catholic church and a woman is a church &gt;&gt; and he sat right there and she sat right there and she's called mystery what &gt;&gt; Babylon &gt;&gt; so it's a Babylon in a mystery &gt;&gt; and all the king of the world &gt;&gt; are drinking from her &gt;&gt; but even though the king are drinking from there. The heart of the king is in the hand of God. &gt;&gt; In other words, God controlled the devil. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Tell the devil that. Tell the devil you are controllable. &gt;&gt; Controllable my friend. &gt;&gt; Tell the devil you are controllable. [Music] &gt;&gt; In French they say metric. &gt;&gt; You are controllable. [Music] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? In other words, no matter what you do, how whatever you do, God is under control. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. We talking about Babylon. Brother Brandham says this in the sound of the town. He said he was also the great what? &gt;&gt; City &gt;&gt; of what? &gt;&gt; Had garden. &gt;&gt; The city of Babylon. Great garden all along. What? &gt;&gt; These walls &gt;&gt; and the palace set where? &gt;&gt; In the center of the city. &gt;&gt; And every street led straight to the palace. &gt;&gt; That's how Babylon was built. So the city had the palace of the king in the center and every street goes straight &gt;&gt; to the center. And for some reason Rome &gt;&gt; because you heard the saying say all street lead to Rome. &gt;&gt; It came from Babylon. &gt;&gt; So Rome duplicated Babylon. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. Brother Brham said and and the palace set where &gt;&gt; in the center of the city &gt;&gt; and every street led what? &gt;&gt; Straight to the palace. &gt;&gt; Rome is built the same way. &gt;&gt; It was called by our babble what? &gt;&gt; Modern Babylon. &gt;&gt; And all roads leads what? &gt;&gt; To Rome. &gt;&gt; All street leads to what? &gt;&gt; The palace. &gt;&gt; Where did they get that architecture from? &gt;&gt; It came from Babylon. Amen. &gt;&gt; And why did they choose to only rebuild everything like the city of Babylon? &gt;&gt; Because your modern Babylon today is Rome. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this. He say there is only what? &gt;&gt; One city &gt;&gt; that I know of in the world. There is actually what? &gt;&gt; Two cities &gt;&gt; that I know of that have what? &gt;&gt; Seven or more mountains in it. &gt;&gt; It is what? &gt;&gt; Cincinnati is one of them. which is supposed to be a fiction story of what? &gt;&gt; Cincinnati. &gt;&gt; It's what? &gt;&gt; The mother wolf. &gt;&gt; Keep your seat belt, my friend. The mother wolf, you know that so forth. But he has what? &gt;&gt; More than that in it. &gt;&gt; When the prophet says something like this, you need to push the break because the prophet already gave you a door. &gt;&gt; He just opened the door and he left the door. All the eyes, &gt;&gt; the anointed eyes can enter into that door to see what more is inside of there. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because brother Brandham is saying the city of Cincinnati have seven hills &gt;&gt; and Rome has seven hills. &gt;&gt; And if you notice, Cincinnati is in the United States. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So there was already a ground of Babylon &gt;&gt; in the United States &gt;&gt; naturally &gt;&gt; because according to Revelation 13, we see two beasts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. There is a beast that come from the water which is Rome. But there is a beef that come like a buffalo. That is the United States. But he will speak like a dragon &gt;&gt; which is Rome. &gt;&gt; So Rome had already a ground in the United States. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. And the ground of Rome was in Cincinnati. And brother Brown say you know the story about what &gt;&gt; mother. &gt;&gt; The mother wolf. Do you know what mother wolf means? &gt;&gt; Buckle up my friend. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is mother wolf. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; This is mother wolf. &gt;&gt; He was put in Cincinnati. This mother wolf is a legend &gt;&gt; of the foundation of Rome. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I thought you guys study history. &gt;&gt; Rome was formed by Romeulus. &gt;&gt; Ramulus &gt;&gt; and Rome. &gt;&gt; It was two twin brother that made that laid the foundation of Rome. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. And according to the legend, they were nursed by a wolf. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So the emblem of Rome is a wolf &gt;&gt; with two twins that are nursing from a wolf. &gt;&gt; Now you begin to understand what brother Brandham is saying. So for some reason if I'm not mistaken Moselini take this big statute &gt;&gt; and came and gave a gift &gt;&gt; not to anywhere only to the state of Cincinnati &gt;&gt; only to the city of Cincinnati and they went in Cincinnati and they put the very emblem &gt;&gt; of Rome in Cincinnati. Why? I hope now you understanding. &gt;&gt; And when brother comes, brother say, "Look at that city have seven hills &gt;&gt; just like the Vatican &gt;&gt; to show the connection between the two &gt;&gt; that the beast is already here &gt;&gt; and Donald Trump wore the clothing of a pope. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together." Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope I'm going through a trembling gun. Amen. And and few days after he did that, an American pop up &gt;&gt; for the first time. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope you are together. &gt;&gt; And in the midst of all that, you are there. &gt;&gt; So we also are found in Babylon. [Applause] I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; The pope is an American. So, American Rome have united. The two beasts has now reunited. Now they are one. &gt;&gt; Are we together? So we are in modern Rome now &gt;&gt; because the Roman is already in America dominating this entire world and God took you captive &gt;&gt; in the midst of Rome. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. God took you and me and placed us in the midst of Babylon &gt;&gt; with a major prophet, &gt;&gt; a Jeremiah model. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen to this my friend. Brother Brandham said, "Don't you remember how who &gt;&gt; that Nimrod, &gt;&gt; their hypocrite built water, &gt;&gt; this big tower &gt;&gt; and made water? &gt;&gt; All the other little cities pay tribute to it. &gt;&gt; Babel and Babel is what? &gt;&gt; The same thing. &gt;&gt; It's just changing what &gt;&gt; it name &gt;&gt; and as it's on as it's coming on up. It's Rome now is what? &gt;&gt; Babylon. &gt;&gt; And the whole world is brought to what? &gt;&gt; To Babylon. &gt;&gt; And it's brought in by what? the world council of churches &gt;&gt; which sh which will make every one of them to do what? &gt;&gt; Bow to her. &gt;&gt; So God pick you and me &gt;&gt; and put us in the age where Rome &gt;&gt; is dominating where Babylon [Applause] &gt;&gt; is dominating the world &gt;&gt; and we find ourselves trapped &gt;&gt; captive &gt;&gt; without our own will. We are finding ourself in the midst of Babylon. &gt;&gt; But remember, the one who brought you here is God. &gt;&gt; The one who put you in this age is God. &gt;&gt; The one who put you in this time is God. &gt;&gt; So God will start and God will finish. [Music] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; And in the age of God say I am the amen. So he's the one finishing the problem. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. So brother Stephven in the midst of Babylon God is there. &gt;&gt; Oh glory to God. In the book of Psalm 3139 verse 8 the Bible says what? &gt;&gt; If I ascend up into heaven &gt;&gt; this is David. He say what &gt;&gt; thou art there. &gt;&gt; How many believe that God is in heaven? &gt;&gt; Amen. David say if I go to heaven he said God is there everybody of us will say amen. &gt;&gt; David didn't finish. &gt;&gt; David says that if I make my bed where &gt;&gt; in hell &gt;&gt; he said behold what &gt;&gt; thou art there. [Music] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham say heaven is already on earth. &gt;&gt; So if we make our bed in her so where is God? You are not alone. Someone is here. &gt;&gt; Because he say I shall not leave you &gt;&gt; nor forsake you. I will be with you all the way to the end. &gt;&gt; The problem is the way you are looking at God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; How do you see God? &gt;&gt; When they say God, you only see God like this. &gt;&gt; But I just show you God in Nebuchadnezzar. &gt;&gt; I show you God in Cy. &gt;&gt; I show you God in the hatred of Joseph. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says this, my friend, there was something in me, something down way &gt;&gt; in me &gt;&gt; that did what? couldn't hold my peace. &gt;&gt; I could see God where &gt;&gt; in the rainbow &gt;&gt; I could see God where &gt;&gt; in the sunset &gt;&gt; I could hear God where &gt;&gt; calling through the wolf. &gt;&gt; Even a wolf, brother Brandham sees God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I know it's hard to swallow, my friend. &gt;&gt; It's spicy. Let's continue. He said, "I could heal God." &gt;&gt; Calling everywhere. &gt;&gt; If you get God way &gt;&gt; on the inside, &gt;&gt; you shall see God where &gt;&gt; anywhere you look. That's right. &gt;&gt; He come to the water &gt;&gt; in here first. &gt;&gt; In other words, we need to anoint our eyes. [Music] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen to this, my friend. Brother Brandham says, "And you know God is what? &gt;&gt; Just so everywhere. &gt;&gt; You can see him where? &gt;&gt; If you'll just get him on the inside of you. &gt;&gt; If you just get God where? &gt;&gt; On the inside of you. That is what makes it so hard for people to see and understand God because he's not where &gt;&gt; in their heart. &gt;&gt; If God is where &gt;&gt; in the heart &gt;&gt; he shows you he shows you what &gt;&gt; himself to you. &gt;&gt; And I seen the sunset and there was God where &gt;&gt; in the sunset &gt;&gt; and I'm going to tell you God is in this Babylon. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Listen to brother Brandham. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this. We read this. Brother Brham say we are facing talking about Isaiah 60. He said we are facing here in in our two subject that we read the water. &gt;&gt; The two scriptures &gt;&gt; rather a very water &gt;&gt; contrast one to the other. &gt;&gt; In Isaiah he says what? &gt;&gt; Arise and shine &gt;&gt; for water. &gt;&gt; The glory of God has come upon you. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; The light is here. &gt;&gt; And the next verse he says what? &gt;&gt; Gross darkness is upon the people. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. And then when we see when we are in the midst of what &gt;&gt; of light and darkness &gt;&gt; and then my address to the church is what? &gt;&gt; Shalom. &gt;&gt; In other words, my message to you who are in Babylon &gt;&gt; today brother say shalom. &gt;&gt; Shalom. &gt;&gt; Shalom means what? &gt;&gt; Peace. &gt;&gt; In other words, don't be troubled. Whatever the pop is doing, whatever the president is doing, whatever is going on on all the earth, shalom. &gt;&gt; Why shalom? The master is here. &gt;&gt; The master of the wind is here. &gt;&gt; Shalom. &gt;&gt; God didn't put you in trouble. &gt;&gt; Listen, my friend. He says, "Let's find out all all about. Let's find found find out what it is all about. We are facing water &gt;&gt; this year &gt;&gt; with water. &gt;&gt; Both darkness and light. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. And the world is one of the water. &gt;&gt; The most chaotic times of darkness that it's ever stood in. &gt;&gt; And yet it's standing in against the water. &gt;&gt; The most blessed light that it ever did. &gt;&gt; It depends on where you see. &gt;&gt; It depends on your understanding, your interpretation, your revelation. I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Daniel was where? &gt;&gt; Shadrach was where? &gt;&gt; In Babylon. &gt;&gt; Abednego was where? &gt;&gt; In Babylon. &gt;&gt; Mach was where? &gt;&gt; In Babylon. &gt;&gt; How many knows the book of Ezra? &gt;&gt; Let's see where Ezra was. &gt;&gt; Do you want to continue? &gt;&gt; In the book of what? &gt;&gt; Ezra. &gt;&gt; 7:6.

[Applause] &gt;&gt; The presence of Babylon never hindered their relationship with God. &gt;&gt; They were predestinated for Babylon. [Music] [Applause] I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Joseph future was not in Canaan &gt;&gt; in Egypt. &gt;&gt; Daniel, Babylon, [Applause] &gt;&gt; he says, "And he was what? &gt;&gt; A ready scribe in the law of Moses, &gt;&gt; which the Lord God of Israel has what? &gt;&gt; Had given. &gt;&gt; And the king granted him what? &gt;&gt; All his requests." &gt;&gt; Which king? The king of whale where where was he at? &gt;&gt; King of Babylon. &gt;&gt; So how is he finding favor with the king? &gt;&gt; God put you in Babylon. &gt;&gt; How is he finding favor with the king? &gt;&gt; He said the king granted him according to what? &gt;&gt; All his requests. &gt;&gt; According to the hand of the Lord his God was where? &gt;&gt; Upon him. &gt;&gt; Where? &gt;&gt; In Babylon. &gt;&gt; In in in which city? &gt;&gt; In Babylon. So the hand of the Lord was moving where? &gt;&gt; In Babylon, &gt;&gt; Nehemiah. But in all this time was I not at what? &gt;&gt; In Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; For in the two and 30th years of who? &gt;&gt; King of what? &gt;&gt; Babylon. &gt;&gt; Came I unto what? &gt;&gt; The king. &gt;&gt; And obtain certain days.

You see now, you see now, you see now &gt;&gt; he want to take a leave, &gt;&gt; a leave absess, &gt;&gt; he need, &gt;&gt; Ezra was where &gt;&gt; Daniel was where? &gt;&gt; Let's see where Ezekiel was. &gt;&gt; You see now? &gt;&gt; You see now? Let's see where Ezekiel was. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The Bible say Ezekiel 1:1. Now it came to pass in the water &gt;&gt; the 30th year &gt;&gt; in the water. &gt;&gt; The fourth month &gt;&gt; in the water. &gt;&gt; The fifth day of the month. &gt;&gt; I was among the water &gt;&gt; captives &gt;&gt; by the river of water. &gt;&gt; She &gt;&gt; and that the heaven were what? &gt;&gt; Open. &gt;&gt; The heaven were open where? &gt;&gt; In Babylon. [Applause] I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. Ezekiel was where? &gt;&gt; In Babylon. &gt;&gt; And the heaven was open where? &gt;&gt; In Babylon. &gt;&gt; So, you need to know how to seize your opportunity. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Let's go to chapter 24, my friend. Amen. I'm going to push the airplane, go up, and then we start heading toward the uh I mean descending. Let's go. Where are we at? &gt;&gt; Verse one. We already seen this. The carpenter. Verse two. Brother Robert, are we good? &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; Okay. And one of one basket has water. &gt;&gt; Very good fig. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Even the figs that are what? &gt;&gt; First, right? &gt;&gt; And the other basket has water. &gt;&gt; Very naughty fig. &gt;&gt; In other words, bad fig. &gt;&gt; They were water. So bad. &gt;&gt; So there is two baskets here with fig. One very good and one water. &gt;&gt; So bad. &gt;&gt; So we need to know who are this basket? Who are these figs in the basket? Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Verse three. Let's go my friend. &gt;&gt; Then said the Lord unto me. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; What cease thou? Jeremiah. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. And I said what? &gt;&gt; Figs. &gt;&gt; The good figs. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; And the what? &gt;&gt; And the evil. &gt;&gt; Very what? &gt;&gt; Evil. &gt;&gt; That cannot be eaten. They are so what? &gt;&gt; Evil. Again the word of the Lord came to me &gt;&gt; saying &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Saying what? That safe water &gt;&gt; the Lord. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; The God of Israel &gt;&gt; like this what? &gt;&gt; Good figs. &gt;&gt; So will I acknowledge &gt;&gt; them that are carried away how? &gt;&gt; Captive of Judah. &gt;&gt; So those that are carried away captive of Judah are represented by what? &gt;&gt; The good things. &gt;&gt; Very good things. &gt;&gt; Can I continue? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Captive of Judah. whom &gt;&gt; I have sent out of this place into the land of the cowines for their good. &gt;&gt; Who sent them? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Who sent them captive? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Yeshua. &gt;&gt; So God is sending somebody captive. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; To Babylon. &gt;&gt; And God say I send the good fig, &gt;&gt; the very good one &gt;&gt; to Babylon &gt;&gt; captive. In other words, I sent the elite. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I didn't send any type of fig. &gt;&gt; The elite. [Applause] &gt;&gt; There was a basket. In that basket there were figs. &gt;&gt; Very good figs. &gt;&gt; And he took those figs and he sent them. He shipped them to Babylon for a mission. &gt;&gt; Ezra in Babylon. Nemiah in Babylon. Daniel in Babylon. Ezekiel in Babylon, Shadrach in Babylon, Mach in Babylon. So when you try, that's why Nebuchadnezzar have to all the most mighty men. &gt;&gt; Because of the caliber of those that goes in Babylon. &gt;&gt; Babylon is a ground of the devil. &gt;&gt; It is Satan Eden. You don't send just anybody in the ground of the devil. You need to send the special force. The force that knows how to camouflage and make things happen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You don't send anybody in Babylon. You need to evaluate them. &gt;&gt; Are we together? What are you doing in this Babylon? And who are you? And why has you been sent in the most darkest age? &gt;&gt; What is in you? &gt;&gt; What is God waiting for you? &gt;&gt; What is God counting on you for? [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Let's go, my friend. Where are we at? &gt;&gt; Verse six. &gt;&gt; Verse six. For I will do what? &gt;&gt; Set mine eyes upon them for good. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. M &gt;&gt; those that went to Babylon, &gt;&gt; God will set his eyes upon them for what? &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; So going to Babylon, you going with a favor. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Let's continue. Come on. And I will do what? &gt;&gt; Bring them again to this land. &gt;&gt; So whoever goes to Babylon, &gt;&gt; have a have a tag. &gt;&gt; It's a round trip. Right? &gt;&gt; When you go, you will come back. &gt;&gt; In other words, you will return home. &gt;&gt; So, you are guaranteed not to stay there. &gt;&gt; But you have a mission &gt;&gt; and your mission must be fulfilled in Babylon &gt;&gt; in the midst of the devil. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's continue, my friend. And I will bring them again to this land. And I will do what? &gt;&gt; I will build them. &gt;&gt; And what? and not pull them down. &gt;&gt; And I will do what? &gt;&gt; I will plant them. &gt;&gt; And not water. &gt;&gt; And not pluck them up. &gt;&gt; And I will give them a heart to know me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That I am who? &gt;&gt; The Lord. &gt;&gt; That they shall be what? &gt;&gt; My people. &gt;&gt; And I will be who? &gt;&gt; Their God. &gt;&gt; Then therefore they shall return to me with their water. &gt;&gt; Whole heart. &gt;&gt; So when you go into Babylon, Yes sir. &gt;&gt; When you are returning to Babylon from Babylon, how are you returning spiritually? You are returning spiritually better &gt;&gt; than the way you came in. &gt;&gt; Some of you didn't get it. &gt;&gt; The way you came in this world, you came shaping iniquity. &gt;&gt; Coming in this word speaking lies. But the way we are going back, &gt;&gt; we're not going the same. &gt;&gt; We are going in the glorified state. In other words, &gt;&gt; in other word, Babylon is our developing ground. [Music] &gt;&gt; Everything that happened in Babylon is only meant to bring me out. [Music] &gt;&gt; My friend, &gt;&gt; I'm trying to head to the airport, &gt;&gt; brother. Adam say being what? &gt;&gt; Eternal with him. &gt;&gt; The beginning &gt;&gt; the eternal life that you had. &gt;&gt; He thought of what you was. &gt;&gt; If you tired, you tell me. &gt;&gt; He thought of what you was only. He wanted you to stand where? &gt;&gt; In the pulpit. &gt;&gt; Say he wanted you to sit where? &gt;&gt; In the seat tonight. &gt;&gt; Then we are serving his what? &gt;&gt; Eternal purpose. And the one that left home only come to the earth to do what? &gt;&gt; Serve his purpose. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Then after it's finished, it is brought back in the water &gt;&gt; glorified state. &gt;&gt; It's what &gt;&gt; matured &gt;&gt; and water &gt;&gt; and brought back again. &gt;&gt; And God say whoever goes to Babylon will come back better. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Jeremiah 29 then we finish. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Jeremiah 29. Let's get our instruction. &gt;&gt; Are you tired or you want instruction? &gt;&gt; You want instruction for Babylon &gt;&gt; or you want to go home? &gt;&gt; So, let's move on. &gt;&gt; Verse one. If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the word of the Lord and the word of the letter Du. &gt;&gt; Verse 20. Uh chapter 29:1 I'm sorry. Now these are the word of who? &gt;&gt; The letter &gt;&gt; the letter that who &gt;&gt; Jeremiah the prophet &gt;&gt; sent from what? &gt;&gt; Jerusalem &gt;&gt; to the what? &gt;&gt; The residue of the elders the rest. Please stay with me. Stay stay tight. &gt;&gt; So we deliver this. If not we stop. We pick it up on Sunday. &gt;&gt; Let's go. He says the for to the residue. The rest &gt;&gt; the rest of the elder which were what? &gt;&gt; Carried away captives &gt;&gt; to the priests and to the what? the prophets &gt;&gt; and to all the people whom who &gt;&gt; Nebuchadnezzar &gt;&gt; has what &gt;&gt; carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon. &gt;&gt; So you know who to whom Jeremiah is talking to. &gt;&gt; Follow me please and then we can hand to the airport. Verse two. After who &gt;&gt; that Jeaniah the king &gt;&gt; look at let's go look at the board. After who? &gt;&gt; Jeconiah. I underline him. Let's go. &gt;&gt; And the queen. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; And the Unix. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; The princes of Judah. &gt;&gt; Look right here. So the same people of 24 continue &gt;&gt; and the carpenters &gt;&gt; you see right there. &gt;&gt; Continue my friend &gt;&gt; and the smiths &gt;&gt; you see right there. &gt;&gt; So it's the same people continue my friend &gt;&gt; were departed from Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. Were departed from what? &gt;&gt; Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; From Jerusalem. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now Job 2:4. &gt;&gt; Thus sayith the Lord of hosts. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; The God of Israel. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Unto all that are carried away captives. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Whom I have caused to be carried away. &gt;&gt; Who caused to be carried away? &gt;&gt; God. Aha. Away from what? &gt;&gt; Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Remember we coming from Jerusalem. Heavenly Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Me and you were in heavenly Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; We came from eternity. &gt;&gt; And we were job in Babylon. &gt;&gt; Are we together? But we we have a mission in Babylon. We need to finish our mission and go back to Jerusalem. But we won't go back the same way. We are going back in the glorified state. But what do we do when we are in Babylon? &gt;&gt; Instruction of Babylon. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to verse four. Thus sayith the Lord. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Thus sayith the Lord of hosts. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; The God of Israel. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. The God of the army. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Unto all that are carried away captives. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem unto Babylon. &gt;&gt; Can I erase this? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Okay. Continue, my friend. &gt;&gt; Build ye houses. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Watch out. &gt;&gt; Watch out. We starting our instruction now. &gt;&gt; We starting our instruction. &gt;&gt; Who want to go home? &gt;&gt; Who want to go home? &gt;&gt; What is the instruction? &gt;&gt; Building houses. &gt;&gt; When they were going to Babylon, did they carry the house? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; But God says do what? &gt;&gt; Build houses. So they they had houses in them. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to move on and drop to the airport. &gt;&gt; Instruction one is what? &gt;&gt; Build ye houses. &gt;&gt; Build what? &gt;&gt; Build houses. &gt;&gt; How am I going to build a house? I'm a captive. &gt;&gt; And God is saying build a house. &gt;&gt; So what is in you? a house. &gt;&gt; In other words, God begin to reveal to them &gt;&gt; what was in them &gt;&gt; when he sent them. &gt;&gt; Exactly right, brother. &gt;&gt; And there is a reason why there is a reason why Jeremiah is telling them this. &gt;&gt; Let's let's get the reason and then we come back to this. &gt;&gt; Go to verse eight. Let's skip to verse eight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go. For what? For thus sayith the Lord of hosts, &gt;&gt; the God of Israel, &gt;&gt; let not your prophets, and your divers that be in the midst of youth, &gt;&gt; deceive you, &gt;&gt; neither hearken to your dreams, which he caused to be dreams. &gt;&gt; And we went through this for the water. &gt;&gt; For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; I have not sent them, sayaith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Verse 10. Follow me. For thus sayith the Lord, that afterward &gt;&gt; 70 years be accomplished at Babylon. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; I will visit you &gt;&gt; and do what? and perform my good word toward you &gt;&gt; in causing you to do what? &gt;&gt; Return to this place. &gt;&gt; So God already have a date. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together that will come to rescue those people from Babylon and take them back to Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the problem is those people were confused by prophet. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; The beginning of the Exodus, the beginning of the captivity, every prophet agree with it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Follow me please. &gt;&gt; But the disagreement was on the return. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The return back home. &gt;&gt; The return back home has many doctrines. I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Some say in two years. &gt;&gt; Some say in three years. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And all those uncertain sound &gt;&gt; were causing confusion. &gt;&gt; And then the behavior of the people did not know what to do &gt;&gt; because when the Paul say when a trumpet give an uncertain sound We don't know what to do. &gt;&gt; Should we stay or should we go? &gt;&gt; Should we engage and integrate &gt;&gt; or should we stay as stranger? &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; So the beginning was not a problem. &gt;&gt; The speculation, the prophecy, the dream were about the time of return. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen.

Amen. &gt;&gt; So there were too many voices &gt;&gt; that were fighting the voice of Jeremiah. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; There was a major prophet &gt;&gt; that already spoke, &gt;&gt; but there were other voices that were misinterpreting &gt;&gt; and speaking things contrary to Jeremiah. &gt;&gt; And because of that, the people were stuck. Amen. &gt;&gt; They didn't know what to do. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; That's why Jeremiah sent a letter. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And say, "This is what you do." &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this, my friend, in the message, the voice of God for the last day, he says what? &gt;&gt; And today, &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; one reason that the church is in the condition that it's in &gt;&gt; is because there is what? &gt;&gt; So many voices. &gt;&gt; So many are the voices to attract the church from what? &gt;&gt; The voice of God. &gt;&gt; Until it is very what? doubtful &gt;&gt; that many would hard would hear the voice of God though he spoke what &gt;&gt; right in their midst &gt;&gt; they perhaps would not even understand it &gt;&gt; uh-huh &gt;&gt; because it would be a what &gt;&gt; a foreign thing to them &gt;&gt; they have gotten themselves so much center on &gt;&gt; the voices of the day &gt;&gt; too much confusion &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; about the return &gt;&gt; let me put it in our way &gt;&gt; too much confusion about when the Lord is coming Because our return goes with the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; But too much interpretation about when the rapture will take place. &gt;&gt; And because of that, we stuck. &gt;&gt; Some thought he was 77. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And they didn't go to school. &gt;&gt; They didn't want to start a business. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They were in two they were in 75.

But if it have not come down, be solid and send Christian. &gt;&gt; Parent, &gt;&gt; parent, &gt;&gt; let the young man go to our school. &gt;&gt; Young man, go to work. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You who are in university, go to work. &gt;&gt; Save your money. &gt;&gt; Be ambitious. Yes. &gt;&gt; Plan your future. &gt;&gt; But always remembering God can come. &gt;&gt; What have we created? [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Instruction. &gt;&gt; Divine instruction from the season. &gt;&gt; Jeremiah years ago, brother Brham didn't give you any scripture here to show you that he and Jeremiah match. &gt;&gt; Yes. He spoke under the inspiration. The same God that spoke through brother Brham spoke in the Bible. And the same God anointed me to see that brother Brham and Jeremiah spoke the same thing under the same condition because he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. God bless you. Let us stand. My friend, thank you very much for going over &gt;&gt; because he help move so next time we pick up the other one. Amen. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we are approaching you humbly this afternoon. Father, thanking you for your grace, your love, your mercy, and for everything you have been doing for us. Father, this is as far as we could go. Lord, I went beyond our normal time, but I pray that you reward each one, Lord, Father, for being willing to let me move on so that Lord, Father, we can get to the next step. Father, these things has been messing around all this message for a while until young people never finish their schooling. &gt;&gt; Some never even went to a career. Yeah, &gt;&gt; they got stuck because of the way things were presented and they found themselves in difficult situation to be even able to provide for their family. But Lord, Father, there was an instruction given clear by your prophet Lord about what to do for the hour of return. You want us to be sane to be solid. If there is something wrong, we correct our walk. We keep our walk center into you, but we live our normal life just like Shadrach, just like Mach. Just like Abednego, Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah, Ezekiel, all of them leave their part and Lord stood for you in the midst of Babylon. Father, you have chosen us to stand in this midst of this modern Babylon so that we can reflect you and shine according to the light that have come in the midst of darkness to show this world that Jesus Christ is alive. Father, I commit this sermon and what was spoken unto the hand. May you touch each young man and the young people to go back and the parent to really listen to this so that they can understand that they need to take things in charge and the time of decision has come &gt;&gt; because they got instructed to know how to move on until we meet you in the air. We thank you and commit everything unto the hand. Bless us all Lord Father in this oncoming week. Father may your blood protect me. I know when we going through this type of sermon, I know fight is waiting for me. May you protect my family, my home, my business, everything that I'm doing, even the church, Lord, so that you stand between me and the work of darkness. Father, I pray that you be with this church and protect each one of us in the name of Jesus Christ. In Jesus precious name. Amen. God bless you church. We love you. Thank you very much.
