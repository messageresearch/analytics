[42:19] happy tonight
[42:21] ah men over cameras on Wednesday God
[42:24] richly bless you after work tours and
[42:27] care and traffic all kind of things but
[42:30] praise the lord we here to worship God
[42:33] Amen there was a praise report that was
[42:36] given to me it's a family that has been
[42:39] streaming for a long time and didn't
[42:41] have a local church and they sent a
[42:43] message they say their prayer has been
[42:46] answered and finally they found a local
[42:48] church they were in the United States so
[42:50] we praise the Lord for that
[42:54] I'm happy for you
[42:56] because that's a wonderful decision
[42:59] brother Branham spoke about everyone
[43:01] having a local church
[43:03] amen
[43:04] amen it's very very very important I was
[43:08] looking at two wins in the New Testament
[43:11] and it's uh it's impressive the way the
[43:14] scripture opened up amen sometimes the
[43:17] decision we take ourselves can put us in
[43:19] trouble
[43:21] and usually you will receive a beautiful
[43:23] win that started when you take a
[43:25] decision when you go the wrong way there
[43:27] will be a breeze that will come and help
[43:30] you up a little bit and then you will be
[43:32] encouraged like what I'm doing is right
[43:34] and then the bad win comes even
[43:37] I've seen it in the scripture
[43:40] so you see people taking decisions want
[43:42] to do this want to do this you want to
[43:44] move want to do this okay fine at the
[43:46] beginning you're going to receive a
[43:47] breeze
[43:48] like everything is Flowing good you see
[43:51] I did it everything is good now it's
[43:53] normal before you know it there is a
[43:55] next win that is coming up I saw it in
[43:57] the Bible right there and I was studying
[44:00] studying I said my goodness amen and
[44:04] sometimes it's innocent people that are
[44:07] caught in there
[44:08] especially children
[44:10] and I feel so bad for children because
[44:13] sometimes they are at the mercy of the
[44:15] parent whatever the parent want to do
[44:18] they are forced to follow the parent
[44:20] even if the parent take a bad decision
[44:23] and then when they suffer everybody's
[44:25] suffering but thank God for
[44:27] predestinated sin
[44:30] amen amen glory to God so make sure
[44:35] before you make any decision check the
[44:38] word
[44:39] check what brother Branham is saying
[44:41] check what does the scripture say before
[44:43] I do what I'm trying to do to make sure
[44:46] if something arise you are in the vision
[44:48] and in the Revelation and when you are
[44:52] in the vision and in the Revelation
[44:54] brother Branham called that the postal
[44:56] the line of duty at that point whichever
[44:59] there will rise up you have a right to
[45:01] take him down because you are in the
[45:04] vision
[45:05] amen
[45:07] you know now the power of a vision
[45:09] without a vision the people live without
[45:12] restraint
[45:13] you're going to follow everybody you're
[45:15] gonna copy everybody you will be doing
[45:18] everything that everybody is doing
[45:19] because you don't have a personal
[45:22] revelation of what God wants you to do
[45:24] for your own life but once you find it
[45:27] no matter what is going on you're going
[45:29] to keep your lane
[45:31] no matter who's passing that's not your
[45:33] problem you keep your lane you know your
[45:35] speed limit you know where you're going
[45:37] because you have a destination that has
[45:40] been clarified by the holy spirit amen
[45:44] I am not preaching today one more praise
[45:48] reporter forget it brother Mark sister
[45:51] Angela's uh husband was taking a
[45:54] training for six weeks and by God's
[45:57] grace today was the last exam he passed
[46:00] all of them successfully and he finished
[46:02] the program

[49:04] just just being able to to be here and
[49:07] you know you don't get to see that a lot
[49:08] where people will pull on the gift of
[49:10] God and and really try to get something

[49:15] service that that was but what a great
[49:16] service this is amen we have to we can't
[49:21] just live on a on a day going by but we
[49:24] have to have a new experience tonight we
[49:26] got to have a new feeling tonight that
[49:28] was great what God did a month or so ago
[49:30] or however long ago it was but but we
[49:33] need God to do something right now but
[49:34] but I'm glad that he's a God that
[49:36] doesn't change amen amen and speaking of
[49:39] that if you if you have your Bibles

[49:52] Hebrews 13 8 amen Hebrews 13 8 and and I
[49:57] would like to take a text this evening
[49:59] if if the Lord would be merciful and

[50:13] amen
[50:15] Hebrews 13 8 yes
[50:18] Jesus Christ

[50:29] Malachi the third chapter in the sixth
[50:33] verse
[50:34] Malachi 3 and 6.
[50:41] say Amen when you have it
[50:44] amen I know somebody out there has it
[50:47] as brother Seth had it amen
[50:50] and it reads like this
[50:53] for I am the Lord
[50:55] I change not Amen Let Us bow our heads
[50:58] dear heavenly father
[51:00] Lord we've read your word Lord this
[51:03] evening father and what a powerful word
[51:06] it is God
[51:07] Lord I think it's beautiful father in
[51:09] that scripture Jesus Christ the same
[51:12] yesterday today and forever
[51:14] Lord you identify yourself there father
[51:17] you put your name in there father so we
[51:21] never have to wonder who the same is
[51:23] Lord but we know it's you father
[51:25] we know that every day that we wake up
[51:28] Jesus Christ is the same yes father we
[51:32] know that every trial we went through
[51:34] and everything we face you're the same
[51:36] Lord we know that every single day no
[51:40] matter what happens or what we have need
[51:43] of you're the same Lord we just want to
[51:45] say thank you so much for that tonight
[51:47] God thank you for being that kind of God
[51:50] that we can always rely on father and
[51:52] and know that you're always there father
[51:54] Lord you were there yesterday with our
[51:57] loved ones Lord on the days gone by our
[51:59] forefathers Lord and even with us and
[52:02] not so long ago and Lord today you're
[52:04] the same Lord and to know that tomorrow
[52:06] father you're still going to be there
[52:08] Lord what a blessing it is to know in
[52:10] our hearts father now tonight Lord You
[52:13] See Me Lord here father with with a
[52:16] little thought that you laid on My Heart
[52:17] Lord and Lord I'm so insufficient Within
[52:21] Myself God lord there's no way I could I
[52:24] could show what's on my heart to the
[52:26] people Lord unless you would come father
[52:29] and Lord I feel like Isaiah Lord when he
[52:31] said I'm a man of unclean lips oh God
[52:34] but father you had a remedy for that
[52:36] Lord God lord you had a way Lord of
[52:39] taking a coal off the altar Lord God and
[52:43] Father you would begin Lord to take that
[52:45] coal and and touch his lips father and
[52:47] purify him where he could speak father
[52:49] and Lord you said your God that changes
[52:52] not father Lord so I know God tonight if
[52:55] you could do that for Isaiah Lord you
[52:58] could do that for me tonight Lord you
[53:00] could do that for us father because he
[53:01] said I dwell among unclean people father
[53:04] and Lord within this flesh and Lord
[53:07] sometimes the the world father can rub
[53:09] off rub off on us when we're rubbing
[53:12] shoulder to shoulder with the world but
[53:14] Lord tonight we're asking you just to
[53:16] take a cold off the altar Lord God take
[53:19] your blood tonight Lord all the things
[53:21] of work and all the things we went
[53:22] through and all the thoughts Lord that
[53:24] are not your thoughts or every thought
[53:26] Lord that goes against you father we
[53:29] bring it down tonight Lord we bring it
[53:31] captive to the word of God Lord that you
[53:34] can have preeminence in this place Lord
[53:36] that that you could speak what you want
[53:38] to speak that you could say what you
[53:40] want to say that you could do what you
[53:42] want to do father well we don't want to
[53:44] just have Simon's party tonight Lord
[53:46] where you come Lord where you're invited
[53:48] with 30 feet father but Lord we want you
[53:51] to be the center of attention father we
[53:53] want you to be welcome we want you to do
[53:56] whatever you want to go in whatever room
[53:58] you want to go down every Avenue that
[54:01] you want to whatever you want to do
[54:03] father that's what we want you to do
[54:05] tonight Lord God and Father tonight Lord
[54:08] we say father forgive us of our
[54:10] shortcomings Lord and we just want to
[54:12] say that we love you Lord bless this
[54:15] service for your children Lord in Jesus
[54:17] Christ's name amen you may be seated
[54:20] now I'd like to speak on that I am God
[54:23] and I change not amen and you know I
[54:26] begin to think of that and and I guess
[54:28] something that that's been going on in
[54:30] my life and in everybody's life is is
[54:33] everything changes and everything's
[54:35] changing all the time you know I was
[54:37] just sitting there thinking about it
[54:39] today of how my daughter she turned four
[54:41] years old and she's she's starting
[54:43] preschool at home with her mom but but
[54:46] next year she'll she'll be taking on
[54:48] kindergarten and and then we'll have to
[54:50] decision to make their own making a
[54:51] change of trying to find her a little
[54:54] Christian School to go to or or or
[54:56] homeschooler you know there's always
[54:58] changes going on in our life you know we
[55:00] can see that that the seasons change
[55:02] we're in a time of Summer and people are
[55:04] praying that it would just change people
[55:07] people are saying it's been so hot and I
[55:09] just want to cool down a little bit but
[55:11] don't worry the change is coming it's
[55:13] going to change every everything is
[55:16] changing you know right now we have the
[55:19] air condition on but but in two or three
[55:21] months we're going to be begging to turn
[55:22] the heat on because because it's going
[55:24] to be cold because things are going to
[55:26] be changing in our life you know our
[55:29] children will go through changes as they
[55:31] get older we can see that that covid-19
[55:33] made a lot of changes in in the way that
[55:35] we used to live life and in the way that
[55:38] we think things we do now when it
[55:39] happened it just changed a lot of things
[55:42] you know your job can change you might
[55:44] have a job one day you might have a job
[55:46] for 30 years and the next thing you know
[55:48] you're let go it can change your health
[55:51] can change we go through a lot of health
[55:52] problems and a lot of Health battles
[55:54] where where our health can change you
[55:57] know we've got friends and people that
[55:59] that we thought would always be there
[56:01] right it would always be beside us right
[56:03] but they've changed they've gone away
[56:05] and they're not there anymore I mean
[56:08] these human bodies were constantly going
[56:10] through changes and and you know you
[56:12] could even see this in a very plain way
[56:14] right there might be a place that you
[56:16] grew up in or a place that you like to
[56:18] go yes sir and you'll go back to to that
[56:20] place years later and you'll go this
[56:22] place doesn't even resemble what it used
[56:25] to be that's exactly because there's so
[56:27] much that has changed yes sir but I'm so
[56:29] glad that that in all these shifts and
[56:33] all these things that change yes there's
[56:35] a solid rock that we can stand on when
[56:38] when the world's change and when when
[56:40] people are changing when things are
[56:42] changing we have an unchangeable God
[56:45] Amen the god that said I am God yes of
[56:48] the Lord and I change not I mean I'd be
[56:51] going through changes you might be go
[56:53] through problems but whatever the change
[56:55] is where you know that your God has not
[56:58] changed amen
[57:00] amen
[57:02] there are many things and practically
[57:04] all things change brother man says time
[57:08] changes people changes weather changes
[57:10] Nations change but God is unchangeable
[57:13] he does not change amen he is still the
[57:18] same all times God is infinite God he's
[57:21] an infinite God I do not believe there
[57:23] would be any way to explain the word
[57:25] infinite because it's the infinite amen
[57:28] he has never had a beginning
[57:31] or he will never have an End Amen
[57:33] therefore when God is called on the
[57:36] scene to act or to make a decision
[57:38] listen the way he acts or the decision
[57:41] that he makes that is forever the same
[57:43] that's it he cannot change it because
[57:46] he's infinite he's perfect in other
[57:49] quote he said now I can make a decision
[57:51] and say it's going to be this way and
[57:54] I'm I'm fine I I will I'll have to
[57:56] change because things come up that I'll
[57:59] have to say well I was wrong but God
[58:01] can't do that because his one decision
[58:04] is that forever amen he cannot change
[58:07] his decisions he cannot change yes
[58:10] therefore if God's attitude towards one
[58:13] sinner that wanted to repent he's he's
[58:15] tying this in here he's saying if
[58:17] there's a sinner that wanted to repent
[58:19] and there was Adam and Eve and God made
[58:21] a way for them to repent and he forgave
[58:24] that sinner the next sinner that comes
[58:27] God has to do the same thing yes sir
[58:29] that sinner or he was wrong how he acted
[58:32] the first time Amen to the first Sinner
[58:34] and if man was sick and God healed one
[58:37] man and that there was ever another man
[58:40] comes to God he's got to do the same
[58:43] thing amen or he did wrong when he
[58:46] healed the first one amen I'm gonna tell
[58:48] you something God Don't Make Mistakes no
[58:50] sir if he comes on the same ground he
[58:53] said what a resting place then for the
[58:55] soul that's seeking Refuge listen his
[58:58] attitude is the same time amen that will
[59:01] take him at his word amen that's what it
[59:04] takes for healing or salvation yes sir
[59:06] you must have faith in God and God is no
[59:10] greater than his word amen for no more
[59:12] perfect in his word amen because God and
[59:15] His word is the self same thing you are
[59:18] no better than your word God is no
[59:20] better than his word amen and your word
[59:23] is what you are and God's word is what
[59:26] he is amen Hallelujah Glory now any
[59:30] person know that if God if God caught on
[59:33] this thing he wants to save a man that
[59:35] was lost and God saved that man by his
[59:38] faith the next man calls on God God will
[59:42] have to save that man if he comes to the
[59:45] same ground yes the first man came on
[59:48] and if there is a sick man and he pleads
[59:51] to God for Mercy that's it if God gives
[59:54] him mercy and healing on the basis of
[59:56] his faith the next man that comes on
[1:00:00] them shame grounds and asks the same
[1:00:02] question yes God's got to act the same
[1:00:06] way or he acted wrong when he acted the
[1:00:09] first time I know that because he tells
[1:00:12] us in the beginning God doesn't make
[1:00:14] mistakes God is infinite he will never
[1:00:16] make a mistake he will never do wrong
[1:00:19] and what he ever done for one he will do
[1:00:22] for another
[1:00:23] [Applause]
[1:00:31] and I began to uh look at that man I've
[1:00:34] never really looked at him before a
[1:00:36] little bit but of course Cornelius was
[1:00:37] his name and you know he was a gentile
[1:00:40] and one day though he began to seek God
[1:00:43] he always tried to honor God and
[1:00:46] everything that he did right and he one
[1:00:48] day he was fast in it and he was praying
[1:00:51] in his room and he was just seeking God
[1:00:53] and seeking God's will right and he
[1:00:55] began to have an angel come into his
[1:00:57] room and it began to tell him about a
[1:01:00] disciple named Peter and he said I want
[1:01:03] you to go to Peter and talk to Peter and
[1:01:06] you see God was working on both ends
[1:01:08] because Peter while he was waiting for
[1:01:11] supper to be ready he began to go up on
[1:01:13] the roof and it said well he sat there
[1:01:15] he went into a trance which we would
[1:01:17] know as a vision and that's right began
[1:01:19] to go in this Vision he began to see all
[1:01:21] these unclean beasts and and the vision
[1:01:24] spoke to him and said said Peter rise
[1:01:27] kill and eat and he said no no Lord I I
[1:01:30] can't do that because these are unclean
[1:01:32] beasts and begin to tell Peter don't
[1:01:35] call that unclean which I have made
[1:01:37] that's it
[1:01:40] and that's very same dream he begins to
[1:01:42] tell him there's men here looking for
[1:01:44] you and don't worry about what they say
[1:01:47] they're telling you the truth because I
[1:01:49] sent them that's right
[1:01:52] so Cornelius begins to go in the room
[1:01:54] and and you know Peter begins to say
[1:01:57] even in the scripture he begins to say
[1:02:00] it's not accustomed for us Jews to have
[1:02:03] you in our household that's right it's
[1:02:05] not custom for us to do this but I've
[1:02:08] seen a vision and you're allowed to come
[1:02:10] in and they begin to talk to him and
[1:02:12] Peter begins to ask Cornelius why did
[1:02:15] you come here
[1:02:17] and he begins to tell about he was
[1:02:19] fashioned and he was praying and the
[1:02:21] angel spoke to him and told him to be
[1:02:23] there in Peter's astonished
[1:02:26] that God would begin to work with this
[1:02:29] Gentile there that God would begin to to
[1:02:32] talk to this man Cornelius who wasn't in
[1:02:35] the Commonwealth of Israel that's right
[1:02:37] and it's even believed that that that
[1:02:39] Cornelius was one of the first Gentiles
[1:02:42] to ever be saved because he would begin
[1:02:45] to crowd
[1:02:48] he would crowd to God and say I want to
[1:02:51] be right
[1:02:52] I want to be saved amen amen then Peter
[1:02:56] opened his mouth and said of truth I
[1:02:58] perceive that God is no respecter of
[1:03:01] persons but in every nation he that
[1:03:05] feareth him and worketh righteousness
[1:03:07] and it is accepted with him amen
[1:03:11] hallelujah God spoke to Peter and told
[1:03:13] him don't call those things unclean amen
[1:03:16] which I have made clean that's right now
[1:03:19] listen Church what I want you to realize
[1:03:21] even though Cornelius wasn't on the same
[1:03:25] grounds as Peter and the fact that he
[1:03:28] wasn't a Jew he wasn't one of the chosen
[1:03:31] eleven but he came the same way that
[1:03:33] Peter came
[1:03:36] he came the same way saying Lord I Need
[1:03:39] Your Mercy Lord I Need Your Grace and
[1:03:42] Hallelujah because he came the same way
[1:03:45] that Peter came and God cannot change
[1:03:49] amen amen
[1:03:52] amen he got the same results that Peter
[1:03:56] got amen
[1:03:58] amen
[1:03:59] under obligation this one here might
[1:04:01] throw you off a little bit but if you
[1:04:02] catch the Revelation you'll understand
[1:04:03] it yes sir amen one time
[1:04:06] when Jesus before his crucifixion
[1:04:09] here comes a little woman
[1:04:12] with her daughter that is sick
[1:04:15] her daughter's sick and and he becomes
[1:04:18] she begins to come to Jesus and and she
[1:04:21] begins to to talk to Jesus and and begin
[1:04:24] to ask Jesus
[1:04:27] Lord
[1:04:28] he should be going to say thou son of
[1:04:30] David
[1:04:31] Hill my daughter
[1:04:33] and Jesus doesn't pay any attention
[1:04:35] right
[1:04:36] and even the disciples say Lord would
[1:04:38] you just cast her away
[1:04:41] she keeps bugging us she won't stop
[1:04:43] following us
[1:04:44] but but Jesus begins to speak to her and
[1:04:48] behold a woman of Canaan came out of the
[1:04:51] same coast and Cried unto him saying
[1:04:53] have mercy on me O Lord thou son of
[1:04:56] David my daughter is grievously vexed
[1:04:59] with the devil but he answered her not a
[1:05:01] word and his disciples came and beso him
[1:05:04] saying send her away for she crieth
[1:05:06] after us amen but he answered and said I
[1:05:08] am not sent but unto the lost sheep of
[1:05:11] the House of Israel amen now listen
[1:05:13] Church how beautiful this is it said but
[1:05:15] then she came and worshiped him saying
[1:05:18] Lord help me I'm Amendment but he
[1:05:21] answered and said it is not me to take
[1:05:23] the children's bread and cast it to dogs
[1:05:26] and she said truth Lord that's it yet
[1:05:30] the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall
[1:05:32] from the master's table that's it now
[1:05:35] brother Branham says the real genuine
[1:05:37] faith will always admit the word of God
[1:05:40] is true no matter what the circumstance
[1:05:43] is amen she said it's the truth amen if
[1:05:46] you wasn't sent to us it's the truth
[1:05:48] amen I'm nothing but a dog I'm amen but
[1:05:51] let me give you my side of it amen for
[1:05:54] the blessings that thank God I'm looking
[1:05:57] for crumbs yes sir now what I want you
[1:06:00] to realize here go ahead now she must
[1:06:03] have been like Cornelius and seen
[1:06:05] something
[1:06:06] because she had to know she had to know
[1:06:10] that Jesus could fix her situation
[1:06:12] that's right that's not what she seen I
[1:06:14] don't know maybe she seen the leper
[1:06:17] healed
[1:06:18] I don't know maybe she seen maybe she's
[1:06:21] seen the captain come and say or the
[1:06:23] Centurion come and say my one of my
[1:06:26] workers is sick and maybe she heard a
[1:06:28] conversation and now he was healed and
[1:06:30] she knew this man had Authority
[1:06:34] maybe she heard the story of geriasis
[1:06:38] daughter that was brought back to life
[1:06:42] maybe she just got done because the
[1:06:44] chapter before that Jesus just got done
[1:06:46] feeding five thousand with a little bit
[1:06:49] of bread and a little bit of fish
[1:06:52] and even though Jesus has said it's not
[1:06:54] me for me to give you this she knows
[1:06:58] that he can do it amen amen amen
[1:07:03] and because even though the time of the
[1:07:07] Gentiles had yet not not yet come
[1:07:10] and it was the time for the Jews her
[1:07:14] faith began to rise up amen she began to
[1:07:18] say I know who this is
[1:07:20] God cannot help but honor Faith you know
[1:07:25] why because he's a God that cannot
[1:07:27] change
[1:07:28] [Applause]
[1:07:32] when Rahab the Gentiles his face yes my
[1:07:36] brother throughout that scared and she
[1:07:39] was saved by faith yesterday she did
[1:07:42] that for that Gentile he had to do it
[1:07:44] for this in time amen
[1:07:49] then Jesus answered and said to her o
[1:07:52] woman great is that Faith he loves faith
[1:07:57] preaching great is thy faith I mean it
[1:08:01] unto thee even as thy will and her
[1:08:03] daughter was made whole from that very
[1:08:06] hour
[1:08:09] because God cannot change amen you might
[1:08:13] not feel like you're much you might feel
[1:08:16] like a dog people might call you a dog
[1:08:19] but they're still crumbs for you
[1:08:22] [Applause]
[1:08:27] he wants to give you everything
[1:08:31] glory to God listen
[1:08:34] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:08:38] Word was spoken was a creative word
[1:08:42] and every word that's spoken cannot be
[1:08:46] taken back for a mistake
[1:08:48] then in the beginning was the word and
[1:08:51] the Word was with God and the Word was
[1:08:54] God and the Word was made flesh and
[1:08:56] dwelt Among Us which is Christ
[1:08:59] and now the word of God written in the
[1:09:02] Bible
[1:09:03] his word to us
[1:09:06] and every promise
[1:09:10] has the same power of creation behind it
[1:09:15] that's God's word
[1:09:18] it the same as the God's word did at the
[1:09:20] beginning if we believe it to be the
[1:09:23] word of God it depends on where the seed
[1:09:26] Falls if it falls into a ground a ground
[1:09:29] that can create a moisture or a
[1:09:32] nourishment around the promise of God
[1:09:34] they will bring forth every promise the
[1:09:37] Bible made why the right mental attitude
[1:09:41] towards any Divine promise of God will
[1:09:45] bring it to pass amen amen
[1:09:48] what he's saying here when you look at
[1:09:51] this word
[1:09:52] this is not just a story no sir
[1:09:56] this is not just a little fairy tale
[1:09:58] that you read at night before you go to
[1:10:01] bed no sense but this is the creative
[1:10:04] spoken words of God Amen if it falls in
[1:10:09] the right ground that's it if you will
[1:10:11] take it in your heart yes sir say this
[1:10:14] is mine yes believe it yes believe that
[1:10:17] yes at the same ground that I'm walking
[1:10:19] on the same ground that was created by
[1:10:23] the spoken word is the same word that is
[1:10:27] in this Bible and you take it into your
[1:10:30] heart it will have the same creative
[1:10:33] effect
[1:10:36] it reminds me of a story that that
[1:10:38] brother Branham told and he begins to
[1:10:41] tell the story of a of an old pirate and
[1:10:43] now he there was a there was a a kid
[1:10:46] that was kidnapped and he was taken on
[1:10:49] this boat this pirate ship and as he was
[1:10:51] taking on this boat he was always that
[1:10:54] young man was raised a Christian and his
[1:10:57] mother raised him in the right way to to
[1:10:59] believe the word of God but believe it
[1:11:01] it all costs and and you know he began
[1:11:04] to uh the captain the old pirate Captain
[1:11:07] began to get sick and he began to get
[1:11:10] sick and die and but while he was there
[1:11:14] there was something in his heart that
[1:11:15] began to cry out I can't die this way
[1:11:18] I I gotta get right with God so so he
[1:11:22] began to look yes I must start feeling
[1:11:25] good here in a minute I'm getting to my
[1:11:27] the part I want to get to go ahead he
[1:11:29] began to look around and he began to ask
[1:11:32] is there anyone here that has a solution
[1:11:34] is there anyone here that has a Bible
[1:11:37] that they can bring to me and and there
[1:11:40] was a little kid that boy on there and
[1:11:42] by the name of Willie Pruitt and he
[1:11:44] began to say I have a Bible
[1:11:47] and he said would you bring it to me and
[1:11:50] he said would you read me something out
[1:11:52] of that Bible and he turned to Isaiah
[1:11:54] 53-5 brother Brandon says it and he
[1:11:57] begins to say he was wounded for our
[1:11:58] transgression and he was bruised for our
[1:12:01] iniquity and the chastisement of our
[1:12:03] peace was upon him and and with his
[1:12:06] stripes we are healed and that that man
[1:12:09] began to say oh that says that sounds
[1:12:11] mighty fine would would you mind to keep
[1:12:14] reading for me but but he began to say
[1:12:16] well sir can I show you how my mama
[1:12:19] taught me how to read it that's it
[1:12:22] maybe he was sick as a young child maybe
[1:12:24] maybe he had a fever one time right then
[1:12:27] his mama began to turn to the creative
[1:12:29] word of God and they began to read it
[1:12:32] and she began to tell him Willy don't
[1:12:34] you let anybody take your name out of
[1:12:36] that scripture that's it and he began to
[1:12:39] tell him he was wounded for Willie
[1:12:41] Pruitt's transparency amen he was
[1:12:43] bruised for Willie Pruitt's iniquity
[1:12:46] of Willie Pruitt's pieces

[1:19:23] living beneath our privileges
[1:19:27] I'll tell you the truth everything
[1:19:30] changes so much Satan uses that change
[1:19:34] to try to get us and battle our minds
[1:19:37] and say God just don't move like that's
[1:19:39] exactly right I just won't do what he
[1:19:42] used to that's a lie of the devil amen
[1:19:46] I must say it plain and clear if God
[1:19:49] don't change someone else must have
[1:19:52] changed
[1:19:54] if God don't change and we ain't seeing
[1:19:58] God move like we want to somebody must
[1:20:01] have changed that somebody's me I'm not
[1:20:05] gonna lay myself down I'm gonna put
[1:20:07] myself on that cross I'm going to
[1:20:10] crucify myself till Jesus Christ can
[1:20:14] live
[1:20:16] I may change he's the same yesterday
[1:20:19] today and forever
[1:20:21] [Music]
[1:20:23] ask and it shall be given to you seek
[1:20:26] and you shall find it knock and it shall
[1:20:29] be open amen
[1:20:32] Preacher Brother Branham says
[1:20:34] I can go on record for this tonight if
[1:20:37] any people will take the right mental
[1:20:39] attitude toward any Divine promise that
[1:20:43] God ever made and claim it for yours he
[1:20:46] will God will bring it to pass if you'll
[1:20:49] take the right attitude towards it can I
[1:20:51] say can I just just say this and I love
[1:20:54] you we can't have the attitude of God
[1:20:55] might do it God may do it
[1:20:59] that's not the same faith that was once
[1:21:02] delivered
[1:21:03] that's not the same fate that was once
[1:21:06] delivered
[1:21:07] our God is more than able amen that's a
[1:21:12] bad attitude amen knowing that if God
[1:21:14] said so the promise is yours and it's
[1:21:17] yours personal property the very minute
[1:21:20] you receive it that way then it has to
[1:21:23] come to pass for Jesus said the word is
[1:21:26] a seed that A sower sowed and a seed if
[1:21:29] it's a germatized seed and goes into the
[1:21:32] ground then that seed under the right
[1:21:34] conditions what is it Lord I believe
[1:21:37] I believe no matter what happens he said
[1:21:40] symptoms are the worst thing that a
[1:21:43] Believer can look to his symptoms
[1:21:45] symptoms ain't got nothing to do with it
[1:21:47] God I believe
[1:21:49] [Applause]
[1:21:51] that's the right motion will bring forth
[1:21:54] the life
[1:21:55] that's in the seed and so is the word of
[1:21:58] God if a person can take that word
[1:22:01] remember creative word and place it in
[1:22:04] their heart and give it the right
[1:22:06] sunshine the right temperature not s-u-n
[1:22:09] but s-o-n the right temperature of faith
[1:22:13] in there that seed and promise will live
[1:22:15] to you just like it did at the beginning
[1:22:18] the one it was given to because it's
[1:22:21] God's word and he is the same yesterday
[1:22:25] today and forever he cannot fail I'll
[1:22:30] tell you what church we need to kill
[1:22:32] some devils tonight we need to kill some
[1:22:34] demons tonight let's say God might can
[1:22:37] do no God has already done it ah amen
[1:22:40] kill some devils tonight let's say my
[1:22:42] family will never come back God said he
[1:22:45] will not lose a woman
[1:22:48] he's coming back no matter what that
[1:22:51] devil said Hallelujah and let me tell
[1:22:54] you something you're not alone the god
[1:22:56] of Glory is on your side and when you
[1:22:59] make that same faith
[1:23:02] brother Brandon said that Jailer that
[1:23:04] night he believed that his house would
[1:23:06] be saved and his house was saved amen
[1:23:10] amen because he came under that same
[1:23:13] faith
[1:23:15] [Applause]
[1:23:18] I don't know about you but I'm done with
[1:23:20] the devil I'm done with his lies I'm
[1:23:23] done with what he told me get me behind
[1:23:26] me Satan I'm sick of it I'm tired of it
[1:23:29] my God is a living God my God is the one
[1:23:33] true God my God changes not
[1:23:37] [Applause]
[1:23:38] my God is a Mountain Mover my God is a
[1:23:42] situation changer my God it's the Healer
[1:23:45] the Supreme
[1:23:48] [Applause]
[1:23:50] that's my God Amen
[1:23:54] I don't know about you but I'm not going
[1:23:56] to serve the God of this evil age but
[1:23:59] I'm serving the one true Living God I
[1:24:03] can go free that's that I can add
[1:24:05] victory
[1:24:06] I believe that amen If He Did It for the
[1:24:10] disciples he'll do it for me
[1:24:14] [Music]
[1:24:17] you say I want the Holy Ghost read to my
[1:24:19] brother the Holy Ghost for the promise
[1:24:22] is unto you and to your children and to
[1:24:26] all that are afar off even as many as
[1:24:29] our Lord Our God shall come is God still
[1:24:32] given the Holy Ghost absolutely
[1:24:35] if you make that same faith that on the
[1:24:38] day of Pentecost they begin to walk out
[1:24:41] and preach the gospel and I believe it
[1:24:43] was three thousand Souls we're saved in
[1:24:46] one day why because they believe what
[1:24:49] the 120 in the upper room believed
[1:24:53] and God honored that faith God couldn't
[1:24:56] give the 120 the Holy Ghost without
[1:24:59] giving the three thousand the Holy Ghost
[1:25:02] [Applause]
[1:25:04] because he honors
[1:25:06] that faith
[1:25:07] and he cannot change
[1:25:09] he will not change
[1:25:13] if you want the Holy Ghost I'll tell you
[1:25:15] this want it
[1:25:18] want it more than your next meal you
[1:25:21] can't say that'd be pretty cool to have
[1:25:23] or that'd be a nice thing to have with
[1:25:24] me hey overcoming power that's great you
[1:25:26] got to be life and death sincere but if
[1:25:30] you make that faith the Holy Ghost is
[1:25:33] yours and people always going well I
[1:25:35] want a refilling of the Holy Ghost and
[1:25:37] I'm just going to say this if it takes a
[1:25:40] dime out to self to get the Holy Ghost
[1:25:43] and you've got to want it more than
[1:25:44] anything I say if you want a refill it
[1:25:47] you gotta want it more than anything
[1:25:49] amen you gotta lay down everything that
[1:25:52] ain't like you you gotta let it go you
[1:25:54] gotta forgive that brother and sister
[1:25:56] that did you wrong
[1:25:59] if you want the life of Jesus you gotta
[1:26:02] act like Jesus
[1:26:07] In the Flesh to forgive you've got to
[1:26:10] forgive you gotta let go when everything
[1:26:13] in your body says hold on you God do
[1:26:17] what he did when he was hanging on the
[1:26:20] cross he said father man forgive
[1:26:25] ah man

[1:26:31] guarantee

[1:26:36] I change not
[1:26:41] can I just say this preaching my brother
[1:26:45] when you
[1:26:46] when you get the true revelation
[1:26:49] of the Bible

[1:26:53] it to you

[1:27:36] me and find me when ye shall search for
[1:27:39] me with all your heart now listen I'm
[1:27:41] gonna tell you
[1:27:42] Jeremiah did that and if Jeremiah did
[1:27:46] that
[1:27:47] man and if I do the same thing
[1:27:52] if I get to a place where I'm wondering
[1:27:55] where God is in my life
[1:27:57] and I know Jeremiah might have had that
[1:28:00] same thought one day where is God at in
[1:28:03] Israel and God spoke to him and said
[1:28:05] Jeremiah when you seek for me with all
[1:28:08] your heart amen and you lay everything
[1:28:10] else aside I'll be there and Jeremiah
[1:28:13] did it and found him if I come and I
[1:28:16] read that scripture and he said then
[1:28:18] Seth if ye shall seek me with all your
[1:28:21] heart
[1:28:22] you'll find me
[1:28:24] that's a promise because God cannot tell
[1:28:27] Jeremiah that and God cannot do that for
[1:28:31] Jeremiah unless he'll do it for you
[1:28:34] amen
[1:28:37] if he would do that for a gentile before
[1:28:40] it was ever the dispensation of the
[1:28:43] Gentiles how much more
[1:28:45] will he do it for the bride
[1:28:48] [Music]

[1:28:53] every woman in the world could ask me to
[1:28:56] buy them something there's a good chance
[1:28:58] I ain't gonna buy it for him but if my
[1:29:01] wife comes to me and says Seth I need
[1:29:05] this I'm going to find a way
[1:29:08] to get it for her
[1:29:11] and we just ain't somebody we just ain't
[1:29:15] a nobody but we're the Bride of Jesus
[1:29:19] ask
[1:29:22] Ed knock
[1:29:23] shake it yes it'll be given yes if he
[1:29:27] did it for Jeremiah he'll do it for me

[1:29:34] his lowest point in life

[1:29:54] I can't time even if at my lowest point
[1:29:59] [Applause]
[1:30:00] I can look to the hills where my hell
[1:30:04] comes from
[1:30:05] I can find the Strong Tower that the
[1:30:08] righteous run into and are saved
[1:30:12] [Applause]
[1:30:13] [Music]

[1:30:50] about me yet he grab those pillars and
[1:30:53] he began to pull it down

[1:31:13] wounded Samson might have been wounded
[1:31:16] but he was still a dog in the fight
[1:31:18] he was still a son of God
[1:31:21] I'm gonna tell you right now if David
[1:31:24] could kill his Goliath
[1:31:26] and he was a Seed of Abraham you can
[1:31:29] kill your Goliath
[1:31:31] if you've lost the joy of your salvation
[1:31:35] and you come to God saying I want the
[1:31:38] joy of my salvation back he's God and he
[1:31:42] changes not I'm happy if he gave David
[1:31:45] that Joy he'll give us that Joy
[1:31:48] Amen brother saith I'm so wrapped up in
[1:31:52] so much self well if Joshua could

[1:32:21] I don't see one stone fire because he
[1:32:24] said as I was with Moses so will I be
[1:32:28] with you Joshua and if he told Joshua he
[1:32:30] would be with him and he said I'll never
[1:32:33] leave you nor forsake you if he'll do

[1:34:25] times when everything's going wrong he's
[1:34:28] still worth it you know why you do that

[1:35:25] by the power of the Holy Ghost I say
[1:35:27] he'll do it again
[1:35:31] big touch and that blood issue dried up
[1:35:35] and he's still the high priest that can
[1:35:39] be touched by the field of our
[1:35:41] infirmities
[1:35:42] [Applause]
[1:35:44] we can touch him we can be set free if
[1:35:49] Hannah could pray so hard that she began
[1:35:53] to have stammering lips
[1:35:55] [Applause]
[1:35:57] that the priest would even think she was
[1:36:00] drunk but she got that child and God
[1:36:03] didn't just give her a child he gave her
[1:36:05] a prophet
[1:36:07] amen Our God don't do nothing halfway
[1:36:12] and our God
[1:36:14] will not
[1:36:16] change

[1:36:22] situation might look bad the world might
[1:36:24] be changed and things might be going bad
[1:36:27] but listen with the worst time in the
[1:36:30] earth before this time it was a time of
[1:36:33] Noah's flood and let me tell you there
[1:36:35] was a man there by the name of Enoch and
[1:36:37] he walked so close with God he began to
[1:36:40] walk so close with him he didn't care
[1:36:42] what the naysayer said he didn't care
[1:36:44] what the doubter said he didn't care
[1:36:46] what everybody trying to prove something
[1:36:48] wrong said he was walking so close to
[1:36:51] God that he began to walk so close to
[1:36:55] God
[1:36:56] brother Branham said a man can walk so
[1:36:58] close to God that the devil don't know
[1:37:01] what to do with him and I say if Enoch
[1:37:03] walks so close to God that his body
[1:37:06] couldn't help but be taken away if he
[1:37:08] can do that and God did that for him and
[1:37:12] God will not change and God honored that
[1:37:15] brother Stephen we're going to walk so
[1:37:17] close to God that one day we're just
[1:37:19] going to walk right on
[1:37:21] [Music]
[1:37:25] Enoch
[1:37:26] he'll do it for you amen

[1:37:45] if the disciples laid hands on the sick
[1:37:47] and they recover he's still doing it
[1:37:49] today if they cast out evil spirit if
[1:37:52] they went by the gate called beautiful
[1:37:54] and said Silver and Gold Have I known
[1:37:56] but that which I have I give to you
