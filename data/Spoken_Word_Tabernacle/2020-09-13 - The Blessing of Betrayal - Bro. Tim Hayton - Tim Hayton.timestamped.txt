[56:24] [Music]
[56:27] our heavenly

[56:36] lord we stand and tremble

[57:10] we're getting
[57:11] [Music]
[57:21] is
[57:27] [Music]
[57:41] foreign
[57:43] [Music]
[58:03] in the name of the lord
[58:06] [Music]
[58:20] that's the way i see this thing it's a
[58:22] family it's not
[58:24] one church versus another church
[58:26] you know i believe you can be a living
[58:28] breathing denomination
[58:30] and set in the church
[58:32] said in a message church and be a one
[58:34] man or one-woman denomination
[58:37] because denominationalism is a spirit
[58:40] and that's what comes in crosses
[58:41] division
[58:43] and it's what happens is is i've been
[58:45] dealing with this at the church when you
[58:47] take the text of the word and you apply
[58:50] your context or your understanding to it
[58:52] there's only one context i know that's
[58:54] accurate and that's given by our
[58:56] heavenly father that's given by the holy
[58:58] ghost so we're we're one family this
[59:00] morning can you say man where what
[59:02] there's one lord one faith one baptism
[59:05] and there's one body but yet there's
[59:06] many members in that body can you say
[59:08] amen
[59:10] romans chapter 8
[59:12] and verse 28 through 31 very familiar
[59:15] portion of scripture i
[59:17] would like to bring greetings from the
[59:18] little church up in the hickory area
[59:21] hildebrand longview it's kind of right
[59:24] there on the border
[59:25] between the counties i thought maybe we
[59:27] would have some more but they're having
[59:29] church this morning
[59:30] and um i wasn't sure about your seating
[59:33] brother stephen said you can handle some
[59:34] but yeah if you almost got enough room i
[59:37] almost just shut it down and said well
[59:39] we're not having church this morning
[59:41] we're going to we're going down to
[59:42] gastonia but we believe that god is in
[59:45] control of everything can you say that
[59:48] can you say amen to that can you say
[59:49] that god is in control of my life
[59:53] he's god in the good times he's god in
[59:56] the bad times he's god when you think
[59:58] he's not god he's still god it's
[1:00:01] irrelevant to what i think and what you
[1:00:03] think
[1:00:04] see god's not interested in we
[1:00:07] it's one-on-one individual affair can
[1:00:09] you say amen romans chapter 8 and verse
[1:00:11] 28 it's a very familiar portion of
[1:00:14] scripture
[1:00:15] says and we what
[1:00:17] know that all things work together for
[1:00:20] good to them that do what
[1:00:22] how many of you love god this morning
[1:00:25] not not just in imagination but how many
[1:00:27] of you really love him this morning
[1:00:30] so this is you that he's talking to
[1:00:33] that love god to them who what
[1:00:36] call according to what
[1:00:38] your purpose
[1:00:40] the pastor's purpose the prophet's
[1:00:42] purpose
[1:00:44] no no no no to
[1:00:45] his purpose
[1:00:47] his purpose for whom he did what
[1:00:51] for no he also did what
[1:00:53] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:00:56] image of his son that he might be the
[1:00:58] firstborn among many brethren
[1:01:00] moreover
[1:01:02] whom he did predestinate them he also
[1:01:04] did what
[1:01:05] called and whom he called he also did
[1:01:08] what
[1:01:09] so who's justified this morning
[1:01:12] who's justified this morning
[1:01:15] amen now i want you to hear i want you
[1:01:17] to tell me who's justified this morning
[1:01:20] oh there we go i am justified it's got
[1:01:23] to become personal and he in whom he
[1:01:26] justified them he also glorified
[1:01:30] watch this what shall we say then to
[1:01:32] these things if god before us
[1:01:38] who
[1:01:40] who can be against us
[1:01:42] who can be against you this morning you
[1:01:45] say you don't know what i'm going
[1:01:46] through he knows what you're going
[1:01:48] through and he still says who can be
[1:01:51] against you because i'm for you can you
[1:01:53] say amen
[1:01:54] may the lord add the blessing to the
[1:01:56] reading of his word you may be seated it
[1:01:59] feels uh it feels a little oily in here
[1:02:01] this morning
[1:02:03] the the the great oiler the great
[1:02:05] mechanic has come down and he's dropped
[1:02:07] some oil into the the gears and he's
[1:02:10] lubing them up this morning and i if you
[1:02:12] come to calf church i come to have
[1:02:15] church and god's always here to have
[1:02:17] church can you say amen
[1:02:23] i want to take a title this morning and
[1:02:25] it might seem just a little odd i have
[1:02:27] never thought about this before in my
[1:02:30] life brother stephen asked me if i would
[1:02:32] come and i said i'll pray about it i
[1:02:34] want to make sure that it was the will
[1:02:35] of god because i'm a pastor and i know
[1:02:38] what god's called me to do he's not
[1:02:40] called me to evangelize the world he's
[1:02:42] not called me to go missionary to the
[1:02:44] world he's called me to be a pastor and
[1:02:46] i want to remain in that calling but i
[1:02:49] do believe that there are times that god
[1:02:51] will permit and for whatever reason he
[1:02:53] let you go and i prayed and i felt led
[1:02:55] and but not until
[1:02:57] yesterday morning i was sitting at the
[1:02:59] house and i was about as blank as that
[1:03:01] screen right there what do i do what
[1:03:04] what do i say this morning realizing i
[1:03:06] can't say it anyway i can't make you see
[1:03:09] it i can't make you experience it that
[1:03:11] it's going to take god himself no man
[1:03:14] can give it to you and when he gives it
[1:03:16] to you no man can take the thing away
[1:03:18] from you can you say amen that's what i
[1:03:20] love about this thing that's what i love
[1:03:22] about what we call the message and what
[1:03:24] we the scriptures you see the message is
[1:03:27] a person
[1:03:28] the message is jesus christ personally
[1:03:30] revealed to you for your day
[1:03:32] whatever he was back then he is today
[1:03:36] and what he is today he will be tomorrow
[1:03:39] that's not a collective revelation
[1:03:41] that's not something that you can say
[1:03:43] well we believe together no you have to
[1:03:45] say i believe this myself
[1:03:48] see i'll go with him alone if nobody
[1:03:50] else is willing to go i'll go with him
[1:03:52] no matter what heartache comes my way
[1:03:55] because it's not between you and me it's
[1:03:58] between me and the one who has came down
[1:04:01] and revealed himself to me and has took
[1:04:04] my name from the roll and give me my
[1:04:07] name and told me your name was laying
[1:04:10] there and i finally had to accept it so
[1:04:12] it's not between me and anybody else
[1:04:16] you can't tell me it's not true
[1:04:18] and expect me to believe it why because
[1:04:21] i met the message
[1:04:23] see the message
[1:04:25] the message is not something
[1:04:28] that's on it's not letters on
[1:04:30] on a page
[1:04:31] that's the text but the contest i still
[1:04:34] have the same word i still have the same
[1:04:37] power
[1:04:39] he's going to have a church without spot
[1:04:42] and without blemish and there is nothing
[1:04:46] there is nothing
[1:04:48] i said there is nothing or no one can
[1:04:50] stop that church
[1:04:52] from coming forth
[1:04:54] because he has called and you will
[1:04:57] surely answer
[1:04:59] [Music]
[1:05:00] you will answer
[1:05:04] because nobody put it in you
[1:05:07] and nobody can reach down and take it
[1:05:09] out
[1:05:12] it took me a while to figure that one
[1:05:14] out it ain't between me and somebody
[1:05:16] else
[1:05:17] it ain't being between me and the pastor
[1:05:19] it ain't between me and brother brahm
[1:05:21] it's between me and god and god alone
[1:05:27] he said who do you say that i the son of
[1:05:29] man or who do men say that i am they
[1:05:32] said well some say you're elias
[1:05:35] some say you're this some say you're
[1:05:37] that he said but i want to know who do
[1:05:39] you say that i am
[1:05:40] see it's a personal intimate walk
[1:05:42] between you and god
[1:05:45] nothing more nothing less it ain't going
[1:05:46] to work
[1:05:48] and now god's coming down to the end
[1:05:50] time
[1:05:51] and he's stripping everything away from
[1:05:53] you
[1:05:54] he's bringing you out of your comfort
[1:05:56] zone
[1:05:57] mama eagle's going down and she's
[1:06:00] getting the fur out and she's throwing
[1:06:02] the fur over the side of the nest
[1:06:05] and you're feeling the stickers and
[1:06:06] you're like what's going on right now
[1:06:09] mama says hey
[1:06:10] it's time to fly
[1:06:13] it's time to fly
[1:06:15] i can't let you fly this morning but he
[1:06:18] can
[1:06:19] he can let you soar above your troubles
[1:06:21] this morning he can let you soar above
[1:06:23] your heartache this morning
[1:06:25] why because he can take you through the
[1:06:26] fire he can take you through the storm
[1:06:30] why because he is the author of it
[1:06:33] but god's not the author of confusion
[1:06:36] but he permits it
[1:06:38] he permits it
[1:06:40] he permits it
[1:06:42] so you'll see who he is
[1:06:46] you know you know what i believe about
[1:06:47] the seals being revealed
[1:06:50] seals revealed jesus christ
[1:06:53] but when they revealed christ guess who
[1:06:55] else it revealed
[1:06:56] [Music]
[1:06:57] ah
[1:06:58] somebody's done catching the revelation
[1:07:01] so when the seven seals was preached who
[1:07:04] was it preached about
[1:07:06] because there was a book
[1:07:08] and when the book was given up and it
[1:07:10] was opened
[1:07:13] it revealed some names that was laying
[1:07:15] inside
[1:07:17] because it be beating the book of
[1:07:19] redemption
[1:07:21] and his wife did not know who she is
[1:07:25] just like the 144 000 do not yet know
[1:07:28] who they are but he knows who they are
[1:07:31] [Applause]
[1:07:33] and you're like that's me
[1:07:35] i see that now that's me
[1:07:38] and god uses so many things to get you
[1:07:41] to see him
[1:07:43] so he can show you who you are
[1:07:46] [Music]
[1:07:48] some of you thought you would never be
[1:07:49] sitting here today
[1:07:52] you were comfortable
[1:07:56] well i want to bring a thought to you if
[1:07:57] god will permit it this morning
[1:08:00] called the blessing
[1:08:04] of betrayal
[1:08:07] never thought about it like this until
[1:08:10] yesterday morning
[1:08:12] every one of us have experienced that in
[1:08:15] our lives
[1:08:16] in our family
[1:08:17] and our homes and our workplaces
[1:08:20] but i want you to think about the word
[1:08:22] betray means to expose one's country
[1:08:25] group or a person to an enemy
[1:08:28] treacherously reveal
[1:08:30] secrets of information
[1:08:32] be disloyal to and the word betrayal
[1:08:35] also means destroy and trust
[1:08:39] i don't know what you've been trusting
[1:08:40] in
[1:08:41] but if you've been trusting anything
[1:08:43] other than jesus christ
[1:08:45] he's going to let whatever he has to
[1:08:48] to destroy your trust and puts your
[1:08:51] trust where it belongs
[1:08:53] you can't put your trust in me i will
[1:08:56] let you down
[1:08:57] you can't put your trust in your husband
[1:09:00] so far somewhere he will let you down he
[1:09:02] might be just as faithful and never have
[1:09:05] an issue with another woman but
[1:09:07] somewhere along the line he will let you
[1:09:09] down
[1:09:10] your wife will let you down
[1:09:13] you know why because god says i david
[1:09:16] says it like this in the book of psalms
[1:09:18] he said when my mother and my father
[1:09:20] have forsaken me he said he knew one
[1:09:23] that would take him up it wasn't the
[1:09:25] king saul it was the army it wasn't his
[1:09:28] wives he said but the lord will take me
[1:09:32] up
[1:09:33] why because he knew david's name
[1:09:36] long after david was gone off the scene
[1:09:39] and other kings had come up on
[1:09:41] succession and because they did right he
[1:09:43] said because of your father david he had
[1:09:46] respect unto david why
[1:09:48] because he knew who david was he knew
[1:09:51] david trusted him with his whole heart
[1:09:53] david had many problems david had many
[1:09:56] betrayals
[1:09:58] many betrayals he had many
[1:10:00] disappointments he had many
[1:10:02] discouragements in his life
[1:10:04] he wanted to quit
[1:10:07] he didn't know if he was called anymore
[1:10:12] i don't know if i'm called to this thing
[1:10:15] you got to ask yourself are you called
[1:10:17] to it
[1:10:18] if you ain't guess what
[1:10:20] oh they can be shaken
[1:10:22] we'll be shaken
[1:10:25] our whole world's shaken
[1:10:27] can you say amen
[1:10:32] i want you to think about this for just
[1:10:34] a moment
[1:10:37] isaiah being a prophet of god according
[1:10:39] to the scripture
[1:10:41] he had his eyes on something he should
[1:10:43] have never fastened his eyes upon him
[1:10:46] he had a dear friend in his life
[1:10:49] that took care of him that whatever he
[1:10:51] asked for
[1:10:54] and god said your eyes are fastened
[1:10:57] on the wrong thing
[1:10:59] isaiah your eyes are fast enough i
[1:11:01] wonder how many times god may have come
[1:11:03] down and said hey as high isaiah what
[1:11:05] are you really looking at
[1:11:07] you know if i'm down he'll come down in
[1:11:09] the subtlety of things and say hey what
[1:11:10] are you looking at
[1:11:12] what are you looking at this morning
[1:11:14] what are you looking at wednesday night
[1:11:15] what are you looking at when you're home
[1:11:17] and we think well that's just my
[1:11:18] thoughts
[1:11:19] no god's coming down and saying what are
[1:11:21] you looking at isaiah what is it you're
[1:11:23] looking at
[1:11:24] well
[1:11:25] i go to church
[1:11:27] i pay my tithes i pay my offerings god
[1:11:29] what are you asking of me he says i want
[1:11:31] to know what you're looking at
[1:11:34] and all of a sudden here uzziah
[1:11:38] god just takes him right off the scene
[1:11:44] and this is what god showed me that
[1:11:47] the betrayal
[1:11:49] that isaiah felt
[1:11:51] in uzziah's death
[1:11:56] revealed what he was really dependent on
[1:12:03] isaiah's
[1:12:04] betrayal
[1:12:06] what he felt in his heart
[1:12:09] now caused him to look at god
[1:12:12] in a way that he had never looked at him
[1:12:14] before
[1:12:16] he made him examine some things a little
[1:12:18] different can you say amen
[1:12:23] he looked at god in a way he had never
[1:12:25] looked at him before now watch this
[1:12:27] the betrayal
[1:12:29] released isaiah
[1:12:33] the blessing of betrayal
[1:12:37] the betrayal released isaiah
[1:12:41] to serve god
[1:12:43] in a way that he had never served god
[1:12:46] before
[1:12:47] there are so many things that comes into
[1:12:50] our lives and we'll just hold on to them
[1:12:52] and we think it's good and we think it's
[1:12:54] a blessing of god
[1:12:56] but it's betraying who you are and god
[1:12:59] will come down and begin to cut that
[1:13:01] thing out of your life and you're like
[1:13:03] but i don't want this to go but god said
[1:13:05] but i am what you need
[1:13:09] well i feel betrayed when god took that
[1:13:11] away he said because that betrayed me
[1:13:15] so the betrayal
[1:13:17] in isaiah's life caused him to be able
[1:13:20] to serve god in a capacity that he never
[1:13:24] could serving before
[1:13:26] [Music]
[1:13:27] because he had his eyes on the
[1:13:30] wrong thing
[1:13:33] the blessing of betrayal
[1:13:38] do you know what isaiah's problem was
[1:13:43] he had a stolen identity
[1:13:45] [Music]
[1:13:47] he assumed the king's identity
[1:13:50] i'm a friend of the king
[1:13:52] [Music]
[1:13:54] everywhere he went he was associated
[1:13:56] with the king but the problem was he was
[1:13:58] associated with the wrong king
[1:14:02] he had the wrong association
[1:14:05] god said hey you're putting that king in
[1:14:08] my place son
[1:14:10] i'm going to bring a blessing into your
[1:14:12] life and it's going to be called
[1:14:13] betrayal
[1:14:15] i'm going to let betrayal come into your
[1:14:18] life daughter
[1:14:19] so that i can give you a blessing
[1:14:21] through betrayal
[1:14:25] because his identity was in king uzziah
[1:14:28] and not in king jehovah
[1:14:31] oh my my message is the identity what is
[1:14:34] the message then
[1:14:36] see you might have an intellectual idea
[1:14:38] brother brahm said you can learn this
[1:14:39] message that we're trying to teach
[1:14:42] well i have received the word for my day
[1:14:44] you ain't received nothing until you're
[1:14:46] born again
[1:14:47] you ain't received nothing till you
[1:14:49] found an altar and something died out
[1:14:52] and something took over
[1:14:54] you're just going through the motions
[1:14:57] and then god lets things get shook up so
[1:14:59] you know what
[1:15:01] you can experience betrayal
[1:15:03] so your job can be your identity
[1:15:06] your career can be your identity
[1:15:11] your pastor can be your identity
[1:15:14] well brother branham is my identity
[1:15:17] [Music]
[1:15:18] wrong identity in all of it
[1:15:22] your identity is jesus christ in christ
[1:15:25] alone
[1:15:27] because what did my prophet come when he
[1:15:29] preached me he never preached himself
[1:15:33] he preached to me
[1:15:37] lord let me dress up a bride
[1:15:41] and i hear him i'm saying eleazar
[1:15:43] tell me a little bit more about him
[1:15:45] what does he really look like
[1:15:48] and he said always thinking about you
[1:15:51] he wants me to tell you that your flesh
[1:15:52] of his flesh
[1:15:54] and bone of his bone that's the identity
[1:15:56] that you've got to have you are a flesh
[1:15:58] of his flesh you are born of his bone
[1:16:01] matter of fact you are life of his life
[1:16:03] you are nature of his nature
[1:16:08] you don't have you can crawl around on
[1:16:10] the floor and you can bark like a dog
[1:16:13] but you ain't gonna be a very good
[1:16:14] imitation why because the nature of a
[1:16:17] dog is not in you
[1:16:19] the nature of a human being is in you
[1:16:21] and if that nature of jesus christ
[1:16:25] the same one that was in the prophet if
[1:16:27] that same nature lays inside of you
[1:16:31] you will do the works of jesus christ
[1:16:34] there is nothing that can stop it i've
[1:16:37] heard them say well we don't believe in
[1:16:39] the gifts no more that the days of
[1:16:41] miracles has passed and we don't do this
[1:16:43] and don't do that and i go finding the
[1:16:45] message where
[1:16:46] god never took them out
[1:16:51] do you realize that many times church
[1:16:53] order
[1:16:54] has got in the way of you having church
[1:16:57] well it says this and it says that and
[1:16:59] it says this and it says that but he
[1:17:01] also turns around and says but if the
[1:17:03] spirit's moving we want to keep the
[1:17:05] spirit moving
[1:17:06] [Applause]
[1:17:09] can you say amen the blessing of
[1:17:11] betrayal coming into your life
[1:17:14] oh we've all experienced it we've all
[1:17:16] struggled with it but i want you to
[1:17:19] understand something blessing is god's
[1:17:22] deliverance to his children
[1:17:25] because it refocuses you
[1:17:29] you know i spent six days in the
[1:17:30] hospital seven battled at home and six
[1:17:33] days in the hospital with cobot
[1:17:35] you know what that was to me
[1:17:37] a blessing
[1:17:40] because laying flat on my back i
[1:17:42] couldn't move so sick i couldn't pick
[1:17:45] the covers that when i was holding cold
[1:17:47] in the hospital to cover my body
[1:17:50] so sick i wanted god to just take me on
[1:17:52] home i said i know you can heal me but
[1:17:54] if you ain't gonna touch me i'm ready to
[1:17:56] go
[1:17:58] there came his presence into the room he
[1:18:00] never said a word
[1:18:01] he just wanted me to know i will never
[1:18:03] leave you nor will i forsake you but
[1:18:06] i'll be with you even in you to the end
[1:18:08] of the age
[1:18:11] you know what it was a blessing because
[1:18:13] you know why i didn't realize it but i
[1:18:15] had lost the joy of my salvation
[1:18:19] the preacher can look oh yes he's a man
[1:18:22] just like you are he's got the same
[1:18:24] battles the same same mind problems the
[1:18:26] same flesh to overcome as you've got
[1:18:30] see your problem is is when you elevate
[1:18:32] a man to a position he should have never
[1:18:36] should have never ever been elevated to
[1:18:38] in the first place
[1:18:41] hello
[1:18:41] hello isaac
[1:18:43] uzziah was a problem
[1:18:47] and i'm putting it this way anything
[1:18:49] that's a problem on a personal level to
[1:18:51] you god will destroy the idol god will
[1:18:54] take it down god will take it out of
[1:18:56] your life because he is going to have a
[1:18:58] preeminence in your life he's going to
[1:19:01] rule and reign upon the throne of your
[1:19:03] heart because everything that he said
[1:19:05] about that wife she has to become she is
[1:19:09] the one that's spotless she is the one
[1:19:11] that without wrinkle she is the one
[1:19:14] that is without blemish but watch this
[1:19:17] he said but she hath made
[1:19:19] she had done a part she has made herself
[1:19:22] ready
[1:19:24] he said when she goes to dropping
[1:19:26] herself
[1:19:27] when she goes to dropping herself back
[1:19:30] in line with the word
[1:19:34] when you can't see it's in your way god
[1:19:36] has to come along and take it out
[1:19:38] and then you have to drop yourself back
[1:19:40] in line
[1:19:41] with the word of god
[1:19:44] he said watch
[1:19:45] the message then or watch the scriptures
[1:19:48] he said there will be a message that'll
[1:19:50] sweep out and catch her
[1:19:52] it's not a different message it's not
[1:19:55] another message coming what it was it
[1:19:58] was the same message
[1:20:01] because the word has never changed it
[1:20:03] was the same message but your eyes were
[1:20:07] else where
[1:20:11] can you say amen
[1:20:14] betrayal to isaiah was a blessing
[1:20:18] watch this isaiah 6 8 said also i heard
[1:20:21] the voice of the lord saying who shall i
[1:20:24] send and who will go for us
[1:20:26] but before that he said oh woe is me a
[1:20:28] man of unclean lips
[1:20:31] because you know why
[1:20:33] uzziah had got in the way
[1:20:36] what's in your way this morning
[1:20:39] what is in your way this morning
[1:20:42] god's taking it all away from you
[1:20:47] you got to learn to trust him
[1:20:49] you have to learn to have a hundred
[1:20:51] percent trust
[1:20:54] he's still god when the bank accounts
[1:20:56] full
[1:20:57] but he's also still god when the bank
[1:20:59] accounts
[1:21:02] see there are two times in your life
[1:21:04] that you should praise god
[1:21:08] when you feel like it
[1:21:10] and when you don't feel like it
[1:21:13] he is worthy to be praised no matter
[1:21:15] what
[1:21:18] the god of the mountain is still the god
[1:21:20] of the valley
[1:21:22] the god of no family problems is still
[1:21:25] the god
[1:21:27] in the family problems
[1:21:29] he's not changed he's just allowed
[1:21:32] things to come in
[1:21:34] to refocus
[1:21:36] why because our focus gets out of line
[1:21:39] our focus gets out of shift but isaiah
[1:21:42] comes down when he reshifted when god
[1:21:45] had let this now notice he had to come
[1:21:48] when god shifted his focus he had to
[1:21:50] come and say god
[1:21:52] i was looking at the wrong thing
[1:21:55] i'd made the heart of worship about
[1:21:57] something that it was not supposed to be
[1:22:00] brother luke you can never wear that
[1:22:02] song out for me
[1:22:03] you can never because you know what that
[1:22:06] was pinned from the hand of god
[1:22:10] inspiration from god himself
[1:22:12] into the hands of an individual who
[1:22:15] understood i've made it something other
[1:22:17] than what it should be made
[1:22:19] [Applause]
[1:22:21] hello now
[1:22:23] he said then said i hear am i send me
[1:22:28] when the betrayal comes
[1:22:30] is it accepted as a blessing
[1:22:33] or is it accepted as a curse
[1:22:36] what i found is i don't know nothing
[1:22:40] and the less i think i know
[1:22:42] when things do arise my reaction can be
[1:22:45] just a little different but if i've got
[1:22:47] it figured out and it's going in the
[1:22:48] direction i think it should be and i'm
[1:22:50] holding on with both hands i might be
[1:22:52] holding on to two things that i
[1:22:54] shouldn't be holding on to
[1:22:56] and god says
[1:22:58] wait a minute what are you doing son
[1:23:00] well god i'm serving you he said no
[1:23:02] you're not
[1:23:04] he said you want to serve me
[1:23:07] but you still holding on to something
[1:23:08] you shouldn't be holding on to now i
[1:23:10] want you to turn it loose you got uh no
[1:23:13] god no
[1:23:15] you need to turn it loose son no no papa
[1:23:18] i'm happy where i'm at no
[1:23:20] turn it loose
[1:23:22] okay you won't turn it loose i know how
[1:23:24] to make you turn it loose
[1:23:28] that's one thing i found out i'm not
[1:23:29] going to tell god no for nothing
[1:23:32] because he knows how to put me through
[1:23:34] the mud he knows how to drag me through
[1:23:36] the not whole bent over backwards
[1:23:39] to get my attention
[1:23:41] and now i'm saying okay i don't even
[1:23:43] know
[1:23:44] what you want me to do anymore
[1:23:46] he says now we're the place where you
[1:23:48] and i can talk
[1:23:51] see i don't know about you but i believe
[1:23:53] god can talk
[1:23:55] to you
[1:23:57] oh well that was for another day no no
[1:23:59] no no he's not the god of history i can
[1:24:02] read about the god of history
[1:24:04] see if the message is locked up here
[1:24:06] he's a god of history but if the message
[1:24:08] here he's god on the scene
[1:24:12] see i still believe that everything he
[1:24:13] did back then he does today
[1:24:16] if i can't make it happen i'm not going
[1:24:18] to stand in your way if you've got
[1:24:19] enough faith to make it happen
[1:24:21] why
[1:24:23] because he says serve me with everything
[1:24:25] thou shalt have no other what
[1:24:28] not god but god's uh
[1:24:32] plural be for me hear o israel for the
[1:24:35] lord your god is what
[1:24:38] one god gods
[1:24:40] so here you know what i found in the in
[1:24:42] in a betrayal
[1:24:45] whether it's a blessing or whether it's
[1:24:47] a curse
[1:24:50] it's taken me some hard times
[1:24:52] to understand this scripture
[1:24:55] they aren't snared with the words of thy
[1:24:57] mouth
[1:25:00] thou art snared with the words of thy
[1:25:02] mouth
[1:25:04] they are taken with the words of thy
[1:25:06] mouth
[1:25:07] so i want you to understand something
[1:25:09] your words
[1:25:11] determine a lot
[1:25:13] when a betrayal comes
[1:25:16] how many of you it's been going good at
[1:25:17] work and everything's going good and
[1:25:18] they come in with no hesitation with no
[1:25:21] warning and they give you the pink slip
[1:25:24] well what did i do
[1:25:25] nothing god said hey i got something
[1:25:27] else i want you to do
[1:25:31] oh but i had it figured out i know i
[1:25:34] don't have nothing figured out anymore
[1:25:36] i don't have anything figured out you
[1:25:38] know why because i'm looking at the
[1:25:40] turmoil that's in the world right now in
[1:25:42] the united states and i see what the
[1:25:44] prophet said they will be completely
[1:25:46] insane before the coming of the lord
[1:25:48] we are you are living in prophecy it's
[1:25:51] no longer
[1:25:52] foretelling of the future you are living
[1:25:54] in it right now
[1:25:56] and it's creeping into the churches and
[1:25:58] trying to get this one again trying to
[1:25:59] get you to sign against this if you
[1:26:01] ain't in this world you ain't gonna side
[1:26:03] for nothing but jesus christ
[1:26:06] we are all one in him right
[1:26:09] i don't care if you're red if you're
[1:26:11] yellow if you're black if i need a blood
[1:26:13] transfusion i'm going to take it from
[1:26:15] you
[1:26:16] you understand what i'm saying i'm going
[1:26:18] to take your blood because i want to
[1:26:20] live and i know of one transfusion that
[1:26:23] would fix all the problems in the united
[1:26:25] states right now
[1:26:27] [Applause]
[1:26:28] listen it ain't a race problem in the
[1:26:30] u.s
[1:26:31] it's a heart problem
[1:26:33] because my bible tells me this it's not
[1:26:36] what goes into a man's mouth that comes
[1:26:39] out in the draw but it's what proceedeth
[1:26:41] forth from a man's heart that's what
[1:26:43] defiles him
[1:26:46] you ever seen two drunks together
[1:26:51] sloppy drinking their arms around one
[1:26:53] another they loving one another before
[1:26:55] they may be ready to kill one another
[1:26:57] because what they got some spirits
[1:27:00] in them
[1:27:03] and they got into a different spirit
[1:27:07] listen if you realize that you can't go
[1:27:09] along with that out there
[1:27:10] and you can't go along with the false
[1:27:12] side of stuff that only leaves one place
[1:27:14] for you
[1:27:16] one place and one place only i told the
[1:27:19] church i said look it's the process of
[1:27:21] elimination is what brings you the
[1:27:22] revelation
[1:27:24] oh well that's intellectualism brother
[1:27:26] tim well i found out i can't walk away
[1:27:28] from this thing
[1:27:31] i can't do it
[1:27:33] i've been tempted to
[1:27:36] i've been tempted to
[1:27:41] and i realized
[1:27:43] i don't belong in this world
[1:27:45] i'm a u.s citizen by birth
[1:27:48] naturally
[1:27:49] but something died in the side and
[1:27:50] something else took over
[1:27:53] and i realized i don't this this world
[1:27:55] is not my home anymore so guess where
[1:27:58] that leaves me by the process of
[1:28:00] elimination the revelation is broken in
[1:28:02] my life i'm ready to go
[1:28:04] i'm ready to leave this whole world and
[1:28:06] see i realize i can't take myself out i
[1:28:08] realize because it's getting closer and
[1:28:11] closer and tighter and tighter and if
[1:28:13] you hadn't figured it out the squeeze
[1:28:15] has already started
[1:28:18] it's already started
[1:28:21] while i'm waiting for the churches out
[1:28:22] there to do this if you don't feel the
[1:28:24] pressure right now maybe there's nothing
[1:28:26] on the inside for you to feel it
[1:28:29] you know what it is it's not the
[1:28:30] pressure out there that's pushing in
[1:28:32] it's the pressure on the inside of you
[1:28:34] pushing back as it comes in do you know
[1:28:37] why
[1:28:38] it's pressurizing on the inside so you
[1:28:40] don't explode and you don't go crazy
[1:28:45] but god brings betrayals into your life
[1:28:47] to point you in the right direction
[1:28:50] he brings them into your life and you're
[1:28:52] like well that makes me real
[1:28:53] uncomfortable good because that means
[1:28:55] you can grow now
[1:28:57] you can come out of your level of
[1:29:00] complacency this is what i found this is
[1:29:03] my personal revelation this morning
[1:29:05] because it's my personal walk with jesus
[1:29:07] christ betrayal strips away the
[1:29:10] unimportant things in a person's life
[1:29:12] revealing the true relevance of the big
[1:29:15] picture
[1:29:17] how many of you thought this thing was
[1:29:18] about you
[1:29:20] and then you figured it out it ain't
[1:29:23] he says it's about me
[1:29:25] but then he turns this oh by the way
[1:29:27] it's also about you but you couldn't
[1:29:29] realize it was about you until you seen
[1:29:31] it was about me first
[1:29:35] the bigger picture when betrayal comes
[1:29:37] it begins to strip away the the relevant
[1:29:40] the unrelevant the unimportant things so
[1:29:42] that you can see the bigger picture so
[1:29:44] that you can really see god and i want
[1:29:46] to look by god's grace for a few minutes
[1:29:49] this morning that a man who was chosen
[1:29:52] of god chosen of god he was called of
[1:29:54] god he was a gifted man
[1:29:56] and we see in his life that the gifts
[1:29:58] and callings are without repentance but
[1:30:01] those things always cause disturbances
[1:30:04] in good and evil
[1:30:07] do you realize if you have the holy
[1:30:09] ghost and you walk into walmart
[1:30:11] amongst a bunch of unbelievers
[1:30:13] there is a disturbance
[1:30:16] when you walk through the doors you
[1:30:18] sisters with your long hair and your
[1:30:19] godly dress when you walk into a bunch
[1:30:22] of uns believers there's a battle that's
[1:30:24] going on
[1:30:26] because that says that woman is looking
[1:30:28] and she says you know that's something
[1:30:29] about that kind of looks right to me
[1:30:32] but that thing that's sitting up on our
[1:30:33] shoulder says ah you don't want to look
[1:30:35] like that you're going to be made fun of
[1:30:37] you
[1:30:38] you cause a disturbance when you walk in
[1:30:40] a place with the holy ghost
[1:30:42] when you walk around you are causing the
[1:30:45] disturbance
[1:30:46] you know what you know why the
[1:30:47] pressure's coming because they're saying
[1:30:49] you don't belong here anymore
[1:30:51] and you've got to get to a point to
[1:30:53] where you say oh but i do you got a good
[1:30:54] point say you're right i don't belong
[1:30:56] here anymore
[1:31:00] god's letting betrayal come every from
[1:31:02] every angle he's letting it come from
[1:31:04] everywhere
[1:31:06] i want to look at joseph for just a few
[1:31:08] minutes and we'll look at some
[1:31:09] scriptures and i want to see in joseph's
[1:31:12] life
[1:31:13] how the
[1:31:14] betrayal was a blessing to joseph
[1:31:16] [Music]
[1:31:21] joseph was minding his own business
[1:31:24] he was doing what god had called him to
[1:31:26] do
[1:31:27] in other words he was going to church
[1:31:29] service after church service after
[1:31:30] church service he was being faithful
[1:31:34] and then there was a major disruption
[1:31:36] come in his life
[1:31:40] he dressed right he looked right
[1:31:48] genesis 37 verse 18 it says when they
[1:31:50] saw him afar off
[1:31:52] even before he came near unto them
[1:31:56] you see why i say you cause a
[1:31:57] disturbance when you walk in somewhere
[1:31:59] they conspired against him
[1:32:02] you walk into a restaurant with the holy
[1:32:04] ghost
[1:32:06] and everybody that's got the devil all
[1:32:08] over them
[1:32:09] the devils are starting to put thoughts
[1:32:11] in their head and they're conspiring
[1:32:12] against you they're conspiring against
[1:32:14] you in the workplace don't worry about
[1:32:16] it you can't lose your job until god
[1:32:18] says it's time to go elsewhere
[1:32:21] he'll make that business prosperous just
[1:32:23] for your sake
[1:32:25] he'll i said he'll make that place you
[1:32:27] work prosperous for your sake you know
[1:32:30] why because i've got an example in the
[1:32:32] bible the spin of prosperity we'll see
[1:32:34] in a minute through a betrayal was put
[1:32:36] in a very difficult situation that he
[1:32:38] himself didn't know how to handle he
[1:32:40] didn't know what to do with it
[1:32:42] but it wasn't his betrayal
[1:32:45] i got betrayed no you didn't
[1:32:47] no you didn't
[1:32:49] that was god's gift to you
[1:32:51] [Music]
[1:32:54] that was god's gift to you
[1:32:57] isaiah so you could set your eyes all
[1:32:59] right
[1:33:00] so you can say oh god here am i
[1:33:02] send me
[1:33:05] send me where wherever he sends you to
[1:33:07] and they conspired against him to slay
[1:33:10] him and they said to one another behold
[1:33:13] this dreamer cometh
[1:33:15] come now therefore let us slay him and
[1:33:17] cast him into some pit and we'll say
[1:33:19] some evil beast hath devoured him we
[1:33:21] will see what will become of his dreams
[1:33:23] and reuben heard it and he delivered him
[1:33:26] out of their hands and said let us not
[1:33:28] kill him and reuben said unto them shed
[1:33:31] no blood but cast him into a pit that is
[1:33:34] in the wilderness and lay no hand upon
[1:33:36] him that he might that he might rid him
[1:33:38] out of their hands and deliver him to
[1:33:40] his father again
[1:33:42] so somebody had some good common sense
[1:33:46] but you know what if he could have
[1:33:48] delivered him
[1:33:50] from his brothers
[1:33:52] with his good common sense he would have
[1:33:54] got in the way
[1:33:56] of god
[1:34:00] he would have got in reuben would have
[1:34:02] got in the way of god
[1:34:07] and it came to pass verse 23 when joseph
[1:34:10] was coming to his brethren
[1:34:12] that they stripped joseph
[1:34:14] out of his coat
[1:34:16] well what'd you take my coat for that
[1:34:17] ain't too bad
[1:34:19] oh you ain't seen nothing yet about what
[1:34:20] we're getting ready to do to you
[1:34:24] they stripped him out of his coat the
[1:34:25] bible says his coat of many colors that
[1:34:27] was on him
[1:34:29] and they took him and they cast him into
[1:34:31] a pit and the pit was empty and there
[1:34:34] was no water in it and he sat down and
[1:34:36] they sat down to eat bread and they
[1:34:38] lifted up their eyes and looked and
[1:34:39] behold a company of ishmaelites came
[1:34:42] from gilead with her camels bearing
[1:34:44] spicery bomb and bomb and myrrh and
[1:34:47] going to carried into egypt and judah
[1:34:49] said unto his brother what prophet is
[1:34:52] there if we slay our brother and conceal
[1:34:53] his blood come let us sell him to the
[1:34:56] ishmaelites and let our not our hand be
[1:34:58] upon him for he is our brother and our
[1:35:00] flesh and his brethren were content
[1:35:03] then they're passed by midianites
[1:35:05] merchant merchant men and they drew and
[1:35:08] lifted up joseph out of the pit and sold
[1:35:10] joseph to the ishmaelites for 20 pieces
[1:35:13] of silver and they brought joseph into
[1:35:15] egypt
[1:35:16] what a betrayal
[1:35:18] of his own household
[1:35:21] and we know
[1:35:23] that all things
[1:35:26] work together
[1:35:28] for the good of them
[1:35:30] so you might as well get happy
[1:35:33] you might as well quit being sad you
[1:35:35] might as well just go ahead and let's
[1:35:36] say god if i got something on me shake
[1:35:38] it off because i know it's all
[1:35:41] working for my good
[1:35:44] notice he not said for your glory he
[1:35:46] said for my glory but it will be for
[1:35:48] your good
[1:35:51] amen
[1:35:52] and we know that all things work
[1:35:53] together for the good of them that love
[1:35:55] god who are called and joseph was called
[1:35:58] for a purpose
[1:36:00] but see it didn't go the way joseph
[1:36:01] thought it should have went
[1:36:04] he was on his way down to take care of
[1:36:07] his brothers
[1:36:12] and we know that all things work
[1:36:14] together
[1:36:16] genesis 39 1-6 and joseph was brought to
[1:36:19] egypt and potiphar an officer of pharaoh
[1:36:22] the captain of the guard an egyptian
[1:36:25] brought him
[1:36:26] bought him of the hands of the
[1:36:27] ishmaelites which had bought brought him
[1:36:30] down thither and and the lord was with
[1:36:32] joseph
[1:36:34] where was he with joseph
[1:36:37] in
[1:36:38] the betrayal
[1:36:41] you know why he had to be with him
[1:36:43] because one day he was going to have a
[1:36:46] new testament author pen it says i will
[1:36:48] never leave you nor will i forsake you
[1:36:53] he couldn't have a word without an
[1:36:55] example to go with it
[1:37:00] think about it let it sink in for just a
[1:37:02] minute
[1:37:04] and the lord was with joseph and he was
[1:37:07] a prosperous man and he was in the house
[1:37:10] of his master the egyptian and his
[1:37:12] master saw that the lord was with him
[1:37:15] that the lord had made all that he did
[1:37:18] to prosper in his hand and joseph found
[1:37:20] grace in his sight and he served him and
[1:37:23] he made him oversee over his house and
[1:37:25] all that he had put into his hand and it
[1:37:28] came to pass from the time that he had
[1:37:30] made him oversee in the house and over
[1:37:33] all that he had the lord blessed
[1:37:37] you see why i said
[1:37:41] god will make you until he's through
[1:37:43] with you in that workplace he will make
[1:37:46] that place prosperous
[1:37:48] and you enjoy the prosperity and it
[1:37:51] always is the blessings of god and he
[1:37:53] said yeah but i got something else for
[1:37:54] you to do
[1:37:56] and you're like but god this is your
[1:37:57] blessings he said yes
[1:38:00] but i've got to give you something else
[1:38:09] the lord blessed the egyptians house for
[1:38:11] joseph's sake and the blessing of the
[1:38:13] lord was upon all that he had in the
[1:38:15] house and in the field
[1:38:17] and all he left that he had in joseph's
[1:38:20] hand and he knew not all he had
[1:38:22] he had so much trust in his man he
[1:38:24] didn't know what he had
[1:38:26] saved the bread which he did eat and
[1:38:28] joseph was a goodly person and well
[1:38:30] favored
[1:38:31] but watch this and we know that
[1:38:34] all things
[1:38:36] all things
[1:38:38] can you say all things
[1:38:43] all things
[1:38:45] i said all things you've got to get that
[1:38:48] see if you're in my mind say well i
[1:38:49] don't know if you're thinking about a
[1:38:50] particular situation i don't know how
[1:38:52] this is good for me he said all things
[1:38:55] see god's not interested in your
[1:38:56] thoughts he didn't consult you when he
[1:38:58] wrote the word of god
[1:38:59] [Music]
[1:39:00] he just said be you transformed by the
[1:39:02] renewing of your mind
[1:39:04] by his word we are transformed not what
[1:39:06] i think about the word not what my
[1:39:08] context says about the word but what he
[1:39:10] says about the word
[1:39:14] genesis 39 7 through 20 and it came to
[1:39:16] pass after these things that his
[1:39:18] master's wife cast her eyes upon
[1:39:20] jehovah's joseph and she said lie with
[1:39:23] me but he refused and said unto his
[1:39:25] master's wife behold my master whateth
[1:39:28] not what is
[1:39:29] with me in
[1:39:30] in the house and he hath committed all
[1:39:32] that he hath into my hand there is none
[1:39:34] greater in the house than i neither hath
[1:39:37] he kept back anything from me but thee
[1:39:40] because thou art his wife how can then i
[1:39:42] do this great wickedness and sin against
[1:39:45] god
[1:39:47] joseph had
[1:39:48] his feelings in the betrayal
[1:39:51] but i can't find where he ever got
[1:39:52] bitter
[1:39:56] hello somebody
[1:39:57] i cannot find one time where joseph got
[1:40:00] bitter in the betrayal
[1:40:03] bitterness will take every bit of the
[1:40:05] joy out of your life bitterness will rob
[1:40:08] you of your victory bitterness will
[1:40:10] bring sickness into the home
[1:40:12] bitterness will cause your family to
[1:40:14] fall apart
[1:40:17] but you don't know what i've been
[1:40:19] through you don't know what my
[1:40:20] experiences does but god knows what your
[1:40:23] experiences is and he permitted it for
[1:40:26] your good.
[1:40:32] oh yes he did
[1:40:34] you realize that's not easy when you're
[1:40:36] in the midst of it to say that you don't
[1:40:38] want to say it because you don't feel it
[1:40:41] but i've been figured out my feelings
[1:40:44] lie to me every day of my life my
[1:40:47] thoughts lie to me every day of my life
[1:40:49] they can see some fabric of my
[1:40:52] imaginations that's not even according
[1:40:54] to god's plan for my life that's not
[1:40:57] even according to his word
[1:40:59] and i have to come and line myself back
[1:41:01] up with this and say okay god here am i
[1:41:07] and it came to pass about this time that
[1:41:09] joseph went into the house to do his
[1:41:11] business
[1:41:12] and there was none of the men of the
[1:41:14] house there within and she caught him by
[1:41:16] his garment saying lie with me and he
[1:41:18] left his garment in his hand and fled
[1:41:20] and got him out and it came to pass when
[1:41:23] she saw that he had left his garment in
[1:41:25] her hand and was fled forth then she
[1:41:27] called into the men of her house and
[1:41:29] spake unto him
[1:41:30] saying you ever had somebody lie on you
[1:41:34] that's one of the worst betrayals
[1:41:37] that you'll ever experience in your life
[1:41:40] you know why
[1:41:42] because the betrayal cannot happen
[1:41:43] unless there's a great form of trust
[1:41:50] oh i trusted that person you know what
[1:41:53] you forgot that they were a human being
[1:41:55] born in sin
[1:41:57] shape and iniquity may be converted on
[1:41:59] the inside but the outside ain't never
[1:42:02] gonna be converted
[1:42:04] and if it wasn't for the holy ghost
[1:42:06] control in your life who knows where you
[1:42:08] would be
[1:42:09] where would i be
[1:42:12] well i can think of a few places i
[1:42:14] should be without the grace of god
[1:42:17] but i can see grace in my life
[1:42:20] in a way that just it humbles me it
[1:42:23] melts me
[1:42:25] you realize you'll betray yourself
[1:42:27] because you've got confidence in you
[1:42:29] that i'll do this and i'll do that and
[1:42:30] i'll do this and god says hey i got news
[1:42:33] for you you are depending upon you
[1:42:36] and i want you to depend upon me
[1:42:41] he never said you will lead yourself and
[1:42:43] guide you he said i will lead you and
[1:42:45] guide you into all truth
[1:42:48] you know what he does he leads you into
[1:42:50] the truth that you can't do it on your
[1:42:52] own
[1:42:53] he leads you into the truth that you
[1:42:55] can't depend on somebody else
[1:43:01] see we've had too much preacher religion
[1:43:04] we've had too much covering
[1:43:10] i i don't care if if a man comes up here
[1:43:14] if i was in this church and he comes up
[1:43:15] here and he preaches his first sermon
[1:43:17] i'm not going to dissect him and say
[1:43:19] well i wonder what he's going to no i
[1:43:20] come and say god here am i
[1:43:23] what i need something from you god
[1:43:26] do you realize you got problems in your
[1:43:27] life that you don't even know that you
[1:43:29] got and god has to let satan come into
[1:43:32] it so he can deliver you from it
[1:43:35] you know why because we're all all right
[1:43:38] in our own eyes
[1:43:41] every man seemeth right in his own cause
[1:43:43] until his neighbor
[1:43:45] come and searcheth him out the bible
[1:43:47] says my neighbor is the holy ghost he
[1:43:50] searches me all the time
[1:43:53] and i've quit fighting searching me
[1:43:58] because i had somebody say there's going
[1:44:00] to be a bride
[1:44:04] she'll be the final voice to the final
[1:44:06] age
[1:44:08] that don't mean that she's going to be
[1:44:10] preaching it
[1:44:11] she might just be living
[1:44:15] your life speaks louder than any sermon
[1:44:18] that can ever be preached
[1:44:20] can you say amen a lived life brother
[1:44:23] brahm said is the thunder that shakes
[1:44:26] the devil
[1:44:27] oh you can talk it all you want but when
[1:44:30] you begin to live it he starts to shake
[1:44:31] just a little bit he starts to quiver
[1:44:34] he sees you start going and start living
[1:44:36] he says i need to watch that but you
[1:44:38] know i still got time
[1:44:40] but when something is dropped down on
[1:44:41] the inside of the anchor you might slip
[1:44:44] every once in a while but he sees you
[1:44:46] get back up and he says i am in trouble
[1:44:48] now
[1:44:49] because i know the message better than
[1:44:52] he or she does
[1:44:53] i've heard it preached i was there when
[1:44:55] the prophet preached i was in every
[1:44:57] meeting that was preached and i know it
[1:45:00] better than they do but i got news for
[1:45:02] him he can't live it
[1:45:04] and he can't make you stop from living
[1:45:07] it
[1:45:08] when the giver the message itself steps
[1:45:10] down on the inside
[1:45:13] there's nothing he can do to stop you
[1:45:15] from living it
[1:45:16] why because the message the person
[1:45:19] becomes alive
[1:45:21] in a body of flesh one more time
[1:45:25] that's exactly right
[1:45:29] and it came to pass when he heard that i
[1:45:31] lifted up my voice and cried this is her
[1:45:33] and he left his garment with me and fled
[1:45:36] and got him out and she laid up his
[1:45:37] garment by her until his lord came home
[1:45:40] and she spoke to him according to these
[1:45:42] words saying the hebrew servant
[1:45:45] which thou has brought unto us came in
[1:45:47] to mock me
[1:45:48] and it came to pass as i lifted up my
[1:45:51] voice and cried that he left his garment
[1:45:54] with me and fled out
[1:45:56] and he came to pass when his master
[1:45:59] heard the words of his wife
[1:46:06] and it came to pass that when the master
[1:46:09] heard the words of his wife
[1:46:12] he took her word for something
[1:46:14] that his eyes should have told him was
[1:46:16] completely different
[1:46:21] if that wife
[1:46:24] can move her husband with a lie
[1:46:26] how much more can the queen of heaven
[1:46:30] move her husband
[1:46:31] with her words
[1:46:33] you see god's revealing who you are
[1:46:37] you didn't know that you could stand the
[1:46:39] test
[1:46:40] you didn't know you could stand when
[1:46:41] others walk away
[1:46:49] we've been doing too much of this
[1:46:55] good to see you brother
[1:46:58] god bless you brother
[1:47:00] god says hey who are you leaning on
[1:47:04] who you leaning on
[1:47:06] are you leaning on the arm of flesh
[1:47:09] no no man after the flesh
[1:47:12] but the spirit
[1:47:16] no man after the flesh
[1:47:18] and it came to pass when his master
[1:47:20] heard the words of his wife
[1:47:22] which she spake unto him saying
[1:47:25] see he didn't go down and see if the
[1:47:27] report's true he didn't go talk to
[1:47:29] joseph about it he just took someone
[1:47:31] else's word for it
[1:47:34] and acted upon it because you know what
[1:47:36] he had trust in her and it sounded good
[1:47:41] besides he's a slave i can't trust him
[1:47:44] anyway
[1:47:47] not understanding
[1:47:49] that his savior
[1:47:51] was standing in his midst
[1:47:55] i'll show you in just a minute
[1:47:59] after this manner did my servant to me
[1:48:01] and his and this kindled his wrath and
[1:48:03] joseph's master took him and put him in
[1:48:05] the prison a place where the king's
[1:48:07] prisoners were bound and there he was in
[1:48:09] prison
[1:48:10] and we know
[1:48:12] that all things
[1:48:14] work together for the good of them who
[1:48:16] love god who are called according to
[1:48:20] his
[1:48:21] purpose
[1:48:25] genesis 40
[1:48:26] 1-5 and then verse 23 and it came to
[1:48:29] pass that after the butler of the king
[1:48:32] of egypt and his baker had offended
[1:48:33] their lord the king of egypt and pharaoh
[1:48:35] was wroth against two of his
[1:48:37] officers against the chief of the
[1:48:39] butlers and against the chief of the
[1:48:41] bakers and he put them in the ward
[1:48:43] in the house of the captain of the guard
[1:48:46] into the prison the place where joseph
[1:48:48] was bound do you realize that that
[1:48:51] offense
[1:48:53] that those two caused their king never
[1:48:56] happened
[1:48:57] until joseph
[1:48:58] was in place
[1:49:00] there is nothing that can befall you no
[1:49:03] betrayal can come no heartache no trial
[1:49:06] but god is already there
[1:49:10] to let you experience it
[1:49:13] but because he's jehovah's summer the
[1:49:16] lord is there
[1:49:18] that when you get to it he already knew
[1:49:21] it was going to happen so he already
[1:49:24] knows how to take you through it
[1:49:29] they could have never offended the king
[1:49:31] till joseph got in prison
[1:49:34] see the world can't go to falling apart
[1:49:36] until you start coming into a position
[1:49:40] it's a position of authority it's a
[1:49:42] position of the word of god being made
[1:49:44] alive
[1:49:46] in other words it's not laying on a page
[1:49:48] anymore
[1:49:49] it's come off into the heart of a man
[1:49:51] and a woman
[1:49:56] will you go also jesus ask them
[1:49:59] where you go also he said
[1:50:02] i wonder they thought huh
[1:50:04] the crowd's walking away
[1:50:06] what do i do
[1:50:09] will you go also
[1:50:11] what about you will you go also
[1:50:16] lord
[1:50:16] [Music]
[1:50:18] that's the words of eternal life
[1:50:21] where can i go to
[1:50:24] where can i go to
[1:50:30] you're in the hour when the rubbers met
[1:50:32] the road now
[1:50:35] there's no playing with games in church
[1:50:37] anymore
[1:50:39] he's coming down and says hey who do you
[1:50:41] say that i am
[1:50:42] well my sister my pastor my deacon my
[1:50:45] brother
[1:50:46] uh brother branham said you know said
[1:50:49] you were this
[1:50:50] he says but i want to know what you
[1:50:53] say about it
[1:50:55] see you ain't going to stand with
[1:50:57] somebody else
[1:50:58] you don't have to stand alone come here
[1:51:01] and when you see me brother when you
[1:51:02] stand alone when i stand alone and he
[1:51:05] stands alone
[1:51:08] then we can link up together
[1:51:11] and a threefold cord is not easily
[1:51:13] broken why
[1:51:14] because if it's just me and he you know
[1:51:16] other cord that's bound this together
[1:51:18] it's called the holy ghost
[1:51:22] uh-huh
[1:51:24] he is the binding in all of this
[1:51:26] the spirit of god is the binding that's
[1:51:29] binding us together
[1:51:33] hallelujah
[1:51:34] the blessing of betrayal
[1:51:36] the blessing of rejection
[1:51:40] when it comes to you don't fight those
[1:51:42] things let them come embrace them and
[1:51:44] say god i don't know why it's here but
[1:51:47] you had to permit it in my life so
[1:51:50] therefore i will rejoice
[1:51:53] because it's still a day that you have
[1:51:55] made
[1:52:02] you think i don't have to eat those
[1:52:03] words to you to think i don't have to
[1:52:05] eat the same bread
[1:52:07] but when i do it's bittersweet
[1:52:11] oh it's sweet in your mouth here but
[1:52:13] then it becomes bitter
[1:52:15] because it goes down and says hi
[1:52:17] you fit you you're starting to figure
[1:52:19] out you can't do this on your own
[1:52:21] you can't do this without me you can't
[1:52:23] figure this thing out without me
[1:52:25] you can't do it he
[1:52:28] says verse 3 says and he put them in the
[1:52:31] ward in the house of the captain of the
[1:52:32] guard in the prison and the place where
[1:52:35] joseph was bound and the captain of the
[1:52:37] guard charged joseph with them just my
[1:52:39] chance
[1:52:40] just happened chance
[1:52:44] come into the prison joseph
[1:52:48] how did joseph become in charge of the
[1:52:49] prison
[1:52:52] potipher's wife lied on him and i'm sure
[1:52:55] potiphar didn't give the man a good
[1:52:56] report he said this man tried to lay
[1:52:59] with my wife
[1:53:00] treat him harshly do everything you can
[1:53:02] to him except kill him barely keep him
[1:53:05] alive barely keep him fruity and then
[1:53:07] all of a sudden he walks in and he says
[1:53:08] hey i want you to take charge of this
[1:53:10] prison
[1:53:12] amen i can't figure that one out
[1:53:17] yeah i can
[1:53:19] because the one who orchestrated it is
[1:53:21] the one in the betrayal
[1:53:25] is there with joseph from start to
[1:53:28] finish
[1:53:32] and the captain of the guard charged
[1:53:34] joseph with them and he served them
[1:53:37] and they continue to season in the word
[1:53:39] and they dream to dream both of them
[1:53:41] each man in his
[1:53:43] each man's dream in one night each man
[1:53:45] according to the interpretation of his
[1:53:47] dream the butler and the baker the king
[1:53:49] of egypt were bound which were bound in
[1:53:52] prison yet not in verse 23 says yet not
[1:53:55] the chief butler remembered joseph but
[1:53:57] forget him
[1:53:58] another betrayal now when you get back
[1:54:01] to pharaoh would you tell him that i
[1:54:03] interpreted that dream correctly
[1:54:06] he said i'll do that for you when i get
[1:54:07] back
[1:54:10] another betrayal
[1:54:12] and we know
[1:54:14] that all things
[1:54:17] all things
[1:54:19] the ugly the nasty the horrible comes
[1:54:23] into your life and we know that all
[1:54:25] things
[1:54:30] what you are when nobody else sees you
[1:54:32] and we know that all things
[1:54:35] and we know that all things work
[1:54:39] all things work out
[1:54:43] hallelujah
[1:54:48] you said it ain't happened yet you know
[1:54:49] why
[1:54:50] because you give up
[1:54:53] you give up because you ain't seen it
[1:54:55] happen yet
[1:54:56] but i found out sister laurel when i
[1:54:58] pull eyesight
[1:54:59] and i pull time out of the
[1:55:01] picture i can say all things are
[1:55:03] possible
[1:55:04] i'm a believer he's called me according
[1:55:06] to his purpose
[1:55:08] and i step into the picture
[1:55:11] many of you heard that told said when my
[1:55:13] little girl was born
[1:55:15] that god said they give they they give
[1:55:17] me the diagnosis that she had down
[1:55:19] syndrome i never accepted it
[1:55:21] i had in a split second i had to accept
[1:55:23] that circumstance and i said i don't
[1:55:25] believe it
[1:55:27] you think that my mind didn't want to
[1:55:29] believe it
[1:55:30] because you know why the doctor
[1:55:34] the trained man said
[1:55:36] that she had this and he seen case after
[1:55:39] case after case
[1:55:41] you know what if i would accept it i
[1:55:43] would have betrayed the word of god and
[1:55:45] god said you will not betray my word
[1:55:47] because my word will not return unto me
[1:55:50] void
[1:55:51] [Applause]
[1:55:52] they said she'd have a hole in her heart
[1:55:54] or she had a hole in her heart we'd have
[1:55:56] to do surgery two years later it's
[1:55:58] closed up and they can't find it she'll
[1:56:00] have trouble with her eyes she don't
[1:56:02] have no trouble with her eyes she'll
[1:56:04] have trouble walking i have trouble
[1:56:06] keeping her down from climbing on stuff
[1:56:08] let alone walking running
[1:56:11] i wish you'll have trouble speaking
[1:56:15] she'll have trouble speaking
[1:56:18] oh you know what that's been a test of
[1:56:21] my faith
[1:56:22] but i had a voice it wasn't a man's
[1:56:24] voice it says i have healed her from
[1:56:27] that
[1:56:28] and so
[1:56:29] does she have it i said well he said she
[1:56:31] did
[1:56:32] not me
[1:56:36] it's those things that when any other
[1:56:38] betrayal comes into my life he's let
[1:56:41] that experience
[1:56:42] let me walk back into that and say now
[1:56:44] wait a minute
[1:56:46] i don't understand this right here
[1:56:48] but over here i knew you were god
[1:56:51] and your word has told me you ain't
[1:56:53] never changed and you will never ever
[1:56:56] change that you're the god of every
[1:56:58] impossibility that comes my way and i
[1:57:01] can go back over here and say you're a
[1:57:03] liar
[1:57:05] you're lying to me
[1:57:07] you're lying to me
[1:57:10] you know what in the last two weeks my
[1:57:12] little girl her speech has become so
[1:57:15] plain that i'm walking through the house
[1:57:17] and because it used to be jibber dabber
[1:57:20] now i'm like what did she say
[1:57:22] ask my wife it's every day what does she
[1:57:24] just say
[1:57:25] you know what it doesn't matter how long
[1:57:28] it lingers it doesn't matter how long
[1:57:30] the hurt is it doesn't matter how long
[1:57:32] the betrayal seems it doesn't matter how
[1:57:35] dark the night is going to get
[1:57:37] it is a blessing he said weeping may
[1:57:40] endure for a night he said but joy
[1:57:44] will come in the morning
[1:57:46] you just hang on
[1:57:50] because white will climb in the morning
[1:57:53] is the one who created the morning
[1:57:56] the one who created the trial the one
[1:57:59] who let the betrayal happen says i am
[1:58:02] still god i am still joel the shaman and
[1:58:05] wherever i step darkness has got to
[1:58:08] stand back
[1:58:10] glory to god
[1:58:12] hallelujah
[1:58:17] don't you think my thought hadn't
[1:58:18] betrayed me in six years
[1:58:21] but my heart his word ain't never
[1:58:23] betrayed me his word will take me all
[1:58:26] the way through
[1:58:28] and it doesn't matter who comes it
[1:58:30] doesn't matter who goes i've got to set
[1:58:33] my eyes on jesus christ and anything
[1:58:36] else does not matter
[1:58:40] there is nothing he cannot do this
[1:58:41] morning
[1:58:42] i said there is nothing you cannot do
[1:58:44] this morning
[1:58:45] but i want this to happen before this
[1:58:47] happens then you ain't gonna get it
[1:58:51] it's got to come how he says it will
[1:58:53] come
[1:58:54] joy will come in the morning
[1:58:58] many times you're in the morning
[1:59:01] and your mind is still in the night
[1:59:03] and god says hey it's time to wake up
[1:59:06] it's time to wake up
[1:59:08] it's time to shake yourself
[1:59:11] it's time to let go of the hurt emotions
[1:59:14] it's time to let go of what you're
[1:59:15] feeling let go and let god
[1:59:17] do what god can do best
[1:59:24] oh that goes against your human
[1:59:25] reasoning that goes against everything
[1:59:27] that you still want to feel you know why
[1:59:29] because you become comfortable and i
[1:59:31] become comfortable where we're at
[1:59:33] because we're creatures of comfort
[1:59:36] if you ain't figured it out there ain't
[1:59:38] nothing around you comfortable anymore
[1:59:40] brother branham said church life is
[1:59:42] running out he said home life is running
[1:59:44] out he says your work as a pastor will
[1:59:47] cease your work as a deacon will cease
[1:59:50] you know why
[1:59:52] because i hear the bills
[1:59:55] he is on his way
[1:59:58] he is coming back to get me i could hear
[2:00:00] the the tinkling
[2:00:02] on the on on the reins
[2:00:05] as the as the chariots coming around the
[2:00:07] corner as the bloodboards coming around
[2:00:09] the corner it ain't just any man that's
[2:00:12] coming in the wagon it ain't just any
[2:00:14] old padre that's coming but it's the
[2:00:17] king of kings and the lord of glories
[2:00:22] oh hallelujah
[2:00:24] he says but i've got to strip it all
[2:00:25] down
[2:00:26] i've got to pull it out away from you
[2:00:29] and we know that
[2:00:30] all things
[2:00:32] work together for the good of them that
[2:00:34] love god that are called according to
[2:00:36] his purpose no wonder paul said in a
[2:00:39] prison being betrayed by everybody
[2:00:41] around him because he stood for what he
[2:00:43] stood for the gospel that was revealed
[2:00:45] to him he said man did not reveal this
[2:00:48] gospel to me but it was the person of
[2:00:50] jesus christ that revealed it to him
[2:00:52] that ain't no man can give it to you and
[2:00:55] they ain't no man can take it away from
[2:00:57] you and they're down in that prison
[2:01:01] in the midst of being betrayed by
[2:01:03] everybody around him
[2:01:10] [Music]
[2:01:13] some of the greatest writings that you
[2:01:15] and i read that encourages your heart
[2:01:19] was in his darkest hour
[2:01:25] it was his darkest time
[2:01:27] that the greatest revelation come nobody
[2:01:30] was around him to pat him on the back
[2:01:32] nobody was around him to pump him up
[2:01:34] nobody was around him to encourage him
[2:01:40] i can see him sitting down there
[2:01:42] and i can see him struggling his mind
[2:01:45] you say de paul struggle he sure did in
[2:01:47] romans chapter seven he said oh who
[2:01:48] shall deliver me from this richest man
[2:01:50] that i am
[2:01:52] amen
[2:01:54] and i can just see
[2:01:56] all of a sudden
[2:01:58] in the midst of the darkness
[2:02:01] there's this little bitty thing starts
[2:02:04] to form over in the corner
[2:02:07] but he's discouraged he can't see it
[2:02:10] he's fighting his own feelings
[2:02:13] [Music]
[2:02:15] well god i know i was doing right i know
[2:02:17] it's a great work i was doing for you
[2:02:18] but why did you find me here he said
[2:02:20] because i can use you better here
[2:02:25] see if you ain't willing to take
[2:02:27] the road less traveled
[2:02:31] if you're not willing to take the
[2:02:33] road less travel how can he use you
[2:02:35] god why why am i here
[2:02:39] lord would you help me
[2:02:41] hey paul
[2:02:44] yes lord
[2:02:46] help me father
[2:02:50] maybe expect him to say okay i'm gonna
[2:02:52] i'm gonna open the gates and i'm gonna
[2:02:53] restore you right back to where you were
[2:02:55] at
[2:02:57] all he said is he paul my grace
[2:03:05] my unmerited favor
[2:03:08] nothing that you did paul remember where
[2:03:10] you were at paul you were a great
[2:03:12] intellectual giant you had your message
[2:03:15] figured out
[2:03:17] but you needed to meet the one who wrote
[2:03:19] the message
[2:03:23] you needed to meet me paul
[2:03:26] but lord you don't understand where i'm
[2:03:28] at he says my grace
[2:03:31] my grace is sufficient to you right
[2:03:34] where you're at
[2:03:37] my grace paul is sufficient
[2:03:41] do you believe that it's all working out
[2:03:43] paul for your good
[2:03:47] lord i have to trust you
[2:03:49] i have to believe that you are he says
[2:03:51] okay pick up your pen
[2:03:53] you want me to write in this dim
[2:03:55] condition you want me to be joyous now
[2:03:58] lord
[2:03:59] he says paul
[2:04:00] pick up your pen
[2:04:02] and write
[2:04:04] he said paul
[2:04:05] get up out of your pity party
[2:04:08] cause you ain't the only one
[2:04:14] i ain't having a pity well i know a
[2:04:15] prophet in the bible
[2:04:17] who said i'm the only one that's left
[2:04:21] elijah what is wrong with you
[2:04:24] i've got 7 000.
[2:04:27] you got what why i can't see them
[2:04:31] that ain't turned away just yet
[2:04:38] you see the gospel
[2:04:40] is not something afar off
[2:04:43] the gospel is flesh
[2:04:46] and the gospel tells you how to deal
[2:04:49] with things when it comes your way
[2:04:58] but you don't know what happened
[2:05:00] he does
[2:05:04] and you know what he expects out of you
[2:05:08] god bless you brother
[2:05:10] i love you anyway i appreciate you
[2:05:13] but he don't know what he did to me it
[2:05:15] don't matter what he did to me
[2:05:18] because i know what jesus christ did for
[2:05:20] me
[2:05:22] oh we're god in flesh we're christ in
[2:05:25] flesh then let's act like it
[2:05:32] what would you do if you had the
[2:05:33] revelation that he did all men will flee
[2:05:35] from me
[2:05:37] why didn't you go tell so and so
[2:05:39] that will you not leave me will you not
[2:05:42] forsake me
[2:05:46] he said lord
[2:05:47] been unto me according to the you know
[2:05:49] why he had to go through that because he
[2:05:52] knew exactly what every one of us would
[2:05:54] go through today
[2:05:56] he knew every emotion he knew every
[2:05:58] feeling that you would have right here
[2:05:59] right
[2:06:00] now and he says i want to be able to
[2:06:03] secure them i want to be able to help
[2:06:06] them in the time of need paul pick up
[2:06:09] your pen and write and tell them down
[2:06:11] there in 2020 and we know
[2:06:14] that all
[2:06:16] things
[2:06:23] watch this
[2:06:25] and it came to pass
[2:06:28] after oh you thought the trial come to
[2:06:31] stay
[2:06:33] you thought the heartache come to stay
[2:06:36] no
[2:06:37] it came to pass
[2:06:39] after it accomplished what he determined
[2:06:43] for it to do hello somebody
[2:06:47] it came to not stay
[2:06:49] but to pass after it accomplished
[2:06:52] according to
[2:06:54] whose purpose
[2:06:56] oh
[2:06:56] his purpose
[2:07:00] i i i've got to hurry and it came to
[2:07:02] pass at the end of two full years
[2:07:07] now notice god said four years
[2:07:10] in other words whatever joseph had to
[2:07:13] experience he couldn't bypass the
[2:07:15] experience
[2:07:18] oh my he couldn't bypass the experience
[2:07:22] however god said he was long he was
[2:07:24] going to experience he had to be right
[2:07:26] there to fully embrace it he had to be
[2:07:28] right there to fully fill every bit of
[2:07:30] it
[2:07:33] you notice god don't let you be absent
[2:07:35] from the pain he don't let you be absent
[2:07:37] from the trial he won't let you be
[2:07:39] absent from the heartache no he says
[2:07:41] show up
[2:07:43] be present
[2:07:45] oh my
[2:07:49] that pharaoh dreamed
[2:07:52] wait a minute pharaoh is going to have a
[2:07:53] dream and just so happen here's just by
[2:07:56] chance god's got this man that can
[2:07:57] interpret dreams in the prison in
[2:08:00] pharaoh's prison
[2:08:01] on top of that
[2:08:05] and behold he stood by the river
[2:08:07] then pharaoh verse 14. i'm not going to
[2:08:09] read it i'm not going to read much more
[2:08:11] then pharaoh sent and called jesus and
[2:08:13] they brought him out hastily of the
[2:08:14] dungeon and shaved himself and he shaved
[2:08:17] himself and he changed his raiment and
[2:08:19] came in under pharaoh now what if he'd
[2:08:21] have said
[2:08:23] well i've been here this long i think
[2:08:24] i'll just stay i am at least in charge
[2:08:26] of the prison and things are going my
[2:08:28] way right now
[2:08:31] no pharaoh said hey
[2:08:34] when the king summons you got to move
[2:08:38] i don't feel like moving you're going to
[2:08:40] move or he's going to make you move
[2:08:49] and he shaved himself and he changed his
[2:08:51] raiment
[2:08:52] you say i'm heavy this morning well then
[2:08:54] put on the garment of gladness
[2:08:58] praise him anyway
[2:09:00] it don't matter how i feel no matter how
[2:09:02] you feel
[2:09:04] i told the church i said we come in here
[2:09:05] we come sad why what are you sad for
[2:09:08] it didn't go the way you thought it
[2:09:09] would go big deal there's a lot of
[2:09:10] things in my life that way they didn't
[2:09:12] but i found out that god knows how to
[2:09:13] make it work out for my good and
[2:09:15] somewhere along the line i'm going to
[2:09:17] embrace the glory i'm going to step into
[2:09:19] the glory
[2:09:23] let's make sure that we we we must make
[2:09:25] sure that we ain't comfortable lay out
[2:09:27] the sins
[2:09:33] hey i don't know how to be anybody else
[2:09:35] but me i don't know how to do anything
[2:09:36] but get out of his way
[2:09:39] so he can speak
[2:09:41] none of what i'm saying this morning was
[2:09:44] premeditated i'll let you look at my
[2:09:47] notes i just got a few scriptures that's
[2:09:49] it
[2:09:53] but he knows right
[2:09:54] where you're at
[2:09:56] and he changed his ramen came in unto
[2:09:58] pharaoh and now therefore let pharaoh
[2:10:01] look out a man discrete and wise verse
[2:10:03] 33 and set him over the land of egypt
[2:10:05] after he told pharaoh everything
[2:10:07] here's his recommendation to egypt
[2:10:11] he's going to let a prisoner
[2:10:12] he's gonna let a man
[2:10:14] who experienced betrayal in a way that
[2:10:17] and probably nobody had ever experienced
[2:10:19] betrayal
[2:10:20] and now he's gonna let him tell the king
[2:10:22] give the king advice
[2:10:26] hello potiphar
[2:10:28] hello master's wife
[2:10:30] that was all part of god's plan by the
[2:10:32] way
[2:10:35] he had the testing and trying
[2:10:38] to make sure that he was fit
[2:10:42] to rule
[2:10:43] i heard a man say one time
[2:10:47] the power without character
[2:10:49] is what
[2:10:51] oh
[2:10:53] but power with counter character is what
[2:10:57] but you know how you're gonna get the
[2:10:58] character
[2:10:59] [Music]
[2:11:00] you got to experience it
[2:11:03] you got to be stripped down you got to
[2:11:05] be laid in the mud you got to be have no
[2:11:08] more feelings and and you can't even
[2:11:10] move every day and you can't this and
[2:11:11] you can't that you get to i can't god i
[2:11:14] can't i can't i can't he says i know
[2:11:16] but i can
[2:11:20] now therefore let a man let pharaoh seek
[2:11:22] out look out a man of a man discreet and
[2:11:25] wise and set him over the land of egypt
[2:11:26] let pharaoh do this let him appoint
[2:11:28] officers over the land and take up a
[2:11:30] fifth part of the land of egypt in seven
[2:11:31] plenties years and let them gather all
[2:11:33] the food of those good years that come
[2:11:35] and lay up corn under the hand of
[2:11:36] pharaoh and let them keep food in the
[2:11:38] cities and that food shall be restored
[2:11:40] to the land against the seven years of
[2:11:42] famine which shall be in the land of
[2:11:43] egypt that the land not perished through
[2:11:46] the famine and the thing was good in the
[2:11:48] eyes of pharaoh in the eyes of all his
[2:11:50] servants and pharaoh said unto his
[2:11:52] servants can we find such a man as this
[2:11:56] a man in whom the spirit of god is
[2:12:04] the man who experienced the great
[2:12:07] betrayal
[2:12:10] who had the spirit of god
[2:12:14] hallelujah
[2:12:17] and pharaoh said unto joseph
[2:12:20] for as much
[2:12:22] as god has showed thee all this
[2:12:24] there is none so discreet and wise of
[2:12:27] thou art
[2:12:28] thou
[2:12:30] you
[2:12:32] pharaoh joseph you've done learned what
[2:12:34] you need to learn
[2:12:36] you done experienced the pain and the
[2:12:37] suffering
[2:12:40] now
[2:12:40] i want you to be second in command of
[2:12:42] egypt
[2:12:44] thou shalt be over my house and
[2:12:46] according unto my word shall all my
[2:12:49] people be ruled
[2:12:51] power
[2:12:52] without character
[2:12:56] according to thy word shall all my
[2:12:57] people be ruled only in the throne will
[2:12:59] i be greater than thou and pharaoh said
[2:13:01] unto joseph see i have set thee over all
[2:13:04] the land of egypt and pharaoh took off
[2:13:07] his ring from his hand
[2:13:13] where do you think the betrayal went
[2:13:16] at that moment
[2:13:20] i would imagine if he knew romans 8 28
[2:13:23] he was said lord
[2:13:25] not we
[2:13:26] and
[2:13:27] i know
[2:13:29] that all things
[2:13:31] you say it's not happened yet brother
[2:13:32] tim well it might be tomorrow
[2:13:35] it might be five years from now
[2:13:37] i don't know
[2:13:39] but all i know is it did not come to
[2:13:41] stay
[2:13:42] it come to
[2:13:44] pass
[2:13:46] and pharaoh took the ring off from his
[2:13:48] hand
[2:13:49] and put it up on joseph's hand
[2:13:52] and arrayed with him vestures of fine
[2:13:55] linen
[2:13:56] isn't that amazing
[2:13:58] that when i go back over here
[2:14:01] he was his own familiar house
[2:14:03] he was stripped
[2:14:05] of everything
[2:14:07] he was stripped of something that he
[2:14:08] loved
[2:14:10] god said you're wearing the wrong coat
[2:14:12] joseph
[2:14:14] i've got something made of fine silk i
[2:14:16] want you to wear in the future
[2:14:18] but i've got to mold your character to
[2:14:21] be able to put them on
[2:14:30] investors a fine linen
[2:14:33] and put a gold chain about around his
[2:14:35] neck
[2:14:36] do you realize
[2:14:38] that all that he lost
[2:14:41] was restored to him
[2:14:45] it didn't come back the way he thought
[2:14:47] it should
[2:14:50] see you can't go back to that point and
[2:14:52] change anything that's happened
[2:14:54] whatever's happening in your life you
[2:14:55] can't go back and change it there's
[2:14:57] nothing you can do
[2:14:58] but many times you're up here
[2:15:01] trying to go forward
[2:15:03] and you're living back here
[2:15:05] and god says hey
[2:15:08] i'm up here
[2:15:09] where are you at well lord
[2:15:11] come here
[2:15:13] come here
[2:15:15] come here
[2:15:18] pick up your tambourine and dance i
[2:15:20] don't feel like it pick it up anyway and
[2:15:22] dance
[2:15:29] you know sometimes i don't feel like
[2:15:30] going to church
[2:15:33] i told the church i said y'all think
[2:15:35] you're the only ones that don't want to
[2:15:36] come to church
[2:15:38] i said sometimes i just don't want to
[2:15:40] come to church i don't want to get out
[2:15:42] of bed on sunday mornings
[2:15:44] sometimes i'm just tired
[2:15:51] i said but something gets me up
[2:15:53] [Music]
[2:15:54] something rolls me over on my elbow
[2:15:57] i can't get my eyes open it drops my
[2:16:00] feet on the floor and i ain't got but
[2:16:01] three hours of sleep because i'm worried
[2:16:03] about somebody in the church and i can't
[2:16:05] sleep all night long i'm worried about a
[2:16:07] situation or problem and i'm praying for
[2:16:09] that problem
[2:16:10] i don't want to get up and come here
[2:16:12] this morning
[2:16:15] god says hey
[2:16:16] it ain't about you
[2:16:19] i didn't call you for you
[2:16:21] i didn't gift you for you
[2:16:23] i gifted you for my glory
[2:16:26] [Applause]
[2:16:28] i i told some at the church just
[2:16:29] recently i said look whether you're a
[2:16:32] deacon a trustee a musician a minister
[2:16:34] or a pastor or whatever it is i said if
[2:16:37] you haven't figured out this thing ain't
[2:16:39] about you then you can't even serve god
[2:16:41] the way you want to because you'll do
[2:16:43] everything in the church you can to
[2:16:44] serve yourself to make you look good
[2:16:48] but real ministry is when you say
[2:16:49] there's no reward
[2:16:51] what did joseph expect to gain in the
[2:16:54] prison taking care of prisoners
[2:16:56] nothing
[2:16:58] but something was in him that drove him
[2:17:00] on to do it
[2:17:03] because there was a reward at the end of
[2:17:05] the road that he could not see
[2:17:09] i like what brother josh bennett i heard
[2:17:11] him at brother
[2:17:12] little nathan barrett's a funeral there
[2:17:14] he was talking about death he said death
[2:17:16] is only as far as you can see
[2:17:19] but there's more beyond that
[2:17:23] well where i'm at is the hardest trial
[2:17:24] brother tim
[2:17:26] it didn't come to stay
[2:17:28] it came to pass wonder how many times
[2:17:30] the bible says that go look go use your
[2:17:32] search engine look and it came to pass
[2:17:35] and it came to pass and it came to pass
[2:17:42] and he made him to ride
[2:17:45] the second chariot
[2:17:47] which he had and that cried before him
[2:17:49] bow the knee and he made him ruler over
[2:17:51] the land of egypt and pharaoh said unto
[2:17:54] joseph i am pharaoh
[2:17:56] without thee no man shall lift up his
[2:17:58] hand or foot in all of egypt
[2:18:01] and we know that
[2:18:11] you don't understand what happens
[2:18:14] and neither did joseph
[2:18:17] until their confront of his brothers
[2:18:19] and that dream he had as a boy
[2:18:23] he said oh
[2:18:26] now all my complaining was in vain
[2:18:29] all my fussing and stew and why this
[2:18:31] happened to me
[2:18:33] was in vain
[2:18:35] because i have god
[2:18:37] had a purpose
[2:18:38] in it all
[2:18:40] right
[2:18:43] hold on
[2:18:44] you'll find the purpose
[2:18:46] it is okay
[2:18:48] weeping may endure for a
[2:18:50] night the joy
[2:18:53] cometh in the morning
[2:18:58] i want you to think about this and i'm
[2:19:00] getting ready to
[2:19:02] let you go
[2:19:05] every person
[2:19:06] every christian
[2:19:08] has to learn to surrender
[2:19:10] to betrayal
[2:19:12] don't mean you like it
[2:19:14] don't mean you can
[2:19:18] rejoice in it in your flesh per se
[2:19:22] but it is a
[2:19:23] blessing
[2:19:25] to you
[2:19:27] that means everything that comes your
[2:19:29] way
[2:19:30] well i know everything that's coming
[2:19:31] orchestrated of god
[2:19:33] well i i agree with that
[2:19:36] but i find in the bible and the oldest
[2:19:39] book
[2:19:40] where he said satan where you been
[2:19:44] well i've been walking up into and
[2:19:45] throwing down there he said hey have you
[2:19:47] considered my bride
[2:19:51] have you considered her well i would
[2:19:54] but you done got her protected you got a
[2:19:56] hedge about her there can't nothing get
[2:19:58] into her

[2:20:04] have you noticed her well i've been
[2:20:05] watching her for 6 000 years but i can't
[2:20:08] get into her
[2:20:10] he says i'll make a deal with you
[2:20:13] i'll let you go down and bring betrayal
[2:20:16] right into her
[2:20:19] and she will not turn her back on me
[2:20:21] [Applause]
[2:20:23] that's a deal i'll take
[2:20:26] and he comes down
[2:20:28] and he lets your close relative
[2:20:32] you know this thing ain't right that's
[2:20:34] right i can prove to you

[2:20:45] i want if you i don't care about the
[2:20:47] message i got a question

[2:20:58] water
[2:20:59] how can two men get out of a boat and
[2:21:01] walk on the water from a scientific
[2:21:03] standpoint
[2:21:04] how can a man take five loaves and two
[2:21:07] fishes and break them off and keep
[2:21:09] creating
[2:21:12] you can't prove it
[2:21:15] but something inside said that ain't
[2:21:17] nothing but the true
[2:21:19] [Applause]
[2:21:24] how can a little shrimp of a man go up
[2:21:27] to the city gates and take the gates off
[2:21:30] and put him on his back and walk up to a
[2:21:33] mountain kill a lion and kill a thousand
[2:21:35] philistines with a jawbone of a dried-up
[2:21:38] ass

[2:21:49] playing games

[2:21:54] captain of the lord's host said this is
[2:21:56] my message this is my bride this is my
[2:21:59] wife and i will defend her
[2:22:02] don't you defend nothing don't you fight
[2:22:05] for nothing let god himself come down
[2:22:08] and fight

[2:22:52] description there are no record there

[2:23:01] of a man who've had the pillar of fire
[2:23:04] visiting
[2:23:06] and he told me that how god brought
[2:23:08] creation into existence
[2:23:10] i can't prove it
[2:23:11] but i sure can't believe it
[2:23:14] you don't have to figure it out you
[2:23:16] don't have to justify it you don't have
[2:23:19] to defend it but he said if thou canst
[2:23:22] believe
[2:23:26] all things are possible brother kelly

[2:24:19] faith and i apply to what's been
[2:24:21] delivered to my day

[2:24:57] chariots of fire
[2:24:59] a chair of fire coming down and picking
[2:25:00] up a man

[2:25:14] have trouble with this bible brother
[2:25:16] carlos i can't prove it i can't but i
[2:25:18] sure can preach it by inspiration and
[2:25:20] say hey this is what it means
[2:25:22] you know why because i'm not giving tim
[2:25:24] hayden's context anymore it's the one
[2:25:26] who wrote it for the time in the season
[2:25:29] that you're in in your life comes down
[2:25:31] and takes the word
[2:25:33] there is nothing new under the sun there
[2:25:35] is no temptation but what's common to
[2:25:38] all men and he takes the scripture of
[2:25:40] the old testament says i know where
[2:25:41] you're at
[2:25:43] but let me show you how it ends
[2:25:48] i've been figured out if i'm going to be
[2:25:50] defended sister larrell i can't defend
[2:25:52] myself

[2:25:56] it
[2:25:57] he'll take care of all the battles for
[2:25:58] me
[2:25:59] if i'll let him fight him
[2:26:03] but i'll run into him and i want to to
[2:26:05] do it
[2:26:06] i want to prove this and i want to prove
[2:26:08] i can't
[2:26:10] i can't
[2:26:11] i can't even prove to you that god lives
[2:26:12] in my heart
[2:26:15] can you prove it to me
[2:26:17] i know one thing my desires have changed
[2:26:19] something happened
[2:26:21] how do i know it's an apple tree
[2:26:23] because it don't produce pears
[2:26:28] it don't produce oranges
[2:26:30] when i reach off the tree and i take an
[2:26:33] apple see it's too simple laying it when
[2:26:34] i reach off the tree and i take an apple
[2:26:36] and i bite into it it ain't tangy and it
[2:26:38] ain't sharp like an orange or like a
[2:26:41] grapefruit no it's sweet and it's juicy
[2:26:45] why
[2:26:46] because it's an apple tree
[2:26:50] watch how jesus how simply makes it
[2:26:53] by their
[2:26:54] fruits
[2:26:55] [Music]
[2:26:59] i told the church the other night i said
[2:27:00] it used to be god's center prophet was
[2:27:02] enough and we found out that wouldn't
[2:27:04] hold you
[2:27:05] he used to be while i received the word
[2:27:07] for my day so i know that's the baptism
[2:27:08] the holy ghost but you found out
[2:27:18] there is no intellectual birth
[2:27:23] it is a
[2:27:24] snotting
[2:27:26] crying
[2:27:27] repenting
[2:27:28] acts 2 38 baby

[2:27:36] oh we're past pentecost i'm past the
[2:27:39] isms
[2:27:41] but i ain't past the
[2:27:42] original i passed the original
[2:27:45] experience refilling me every once in a
[2:27:48] while
[2:27:50] that's what keeps me going it ain't what
[2:27:51] i know up here because you know what i
[2:27:53] figured out i don't know i know very
[2:27:54] little
[2:27:57] don't worry about trying to prove this
[2:27:59] thing
