the man of justice for my soul mercy said no i'm not gonna let you i'm not gonna let you slip away you don't have to be afraid mercy said no still will never take control [Music] life and death stood face to face as darkness tried to steal my heart away thank you lord thank you jesus because your mercy said no see god so loved the world that he sent his son to save us with that cross he built a bridge to set me free oh but deep within us there is still a war that's raging that makes his sacrifice so hard to see oh as midnight fell on crucifixion day [Music] the light of hope seems so far away as satan tries to stop redemption but mercy says no i'm not gonna let you go i'm not gonna let you slip away you don't have to be afraid [Music] the face of face as donna tried to steal my heart

amen what you have spent and invested into the work of the lord let us all stand as we read the word of the lord let's read in the book of luke luke chapter 5 i would like to speak on standing in the presence of the supernatural standing in the mess of the supernatural oh my isn't that your desire tonight amen to stand in the midst of his presence hallelujah your your life can never be the same hallelujah you can never be the same hallelujah now bible readers follow john luke chapter 5 amen we read a few verses together and it came to pass that as he as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of god he stood by the lake he he never had other things he never kept him busy with other things people were always pressing around him for the word and jesus was always kept busy with the word there was no business deals and you know trying to find a network where you can have wi-fi and stream no he was always busy with the work of god he stood by the lake of januzaret and saw two ships standing by the lake but the fishermen were gone out of them and they were washing their nets and he entered into one of those ships which was simon's and prayed him that he would trust out a little from the land amen he wanted to see the people better he wanted to just get a little pulpit there and really see the people as he preached the word out of little from the land and he sat down and taught the people out of the ship oh my you could have imagined the atmosphere for those people standing in the presence of the supernatural oh my anything was about to happen the supernatural was there he was their brothers and sisters now when he had left speaking he said unto simon launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a little drought for drought oh my something was about to happen something was about to take place and simon answered and said unto you master master we have toiled all night and have taken nothing nevertheless and i would i will let down the net heavenly father bless us now as we have read your word father lord jesus we are standing in your presence and lord jesus something is about to happen and we are under expectation lord open up our hearts open up us lord so that we can receive you lord in jesus name amen [Music] praise the name of the lord hallelujah i wonder you know maybe some of you has listened to the testimony but i feel that just we have to share one or two of these testimonies you know and i went to the amazon and and i ministered for four weeks it was quite a difficult time it was a it was it was it was tough territory i would love to ask our young people make sure before you get married you know i know you want to get married you want to get a wife and start and and you know but but before you get into that face do me one favor travel a little bit you know just form a missionary group and save some money and go to these places because some of these places that i went you know your age your age is catching up with us i'm almost 50. i'm i'm not old but it's catching up with us because i was thinking when i was on the boat it was it's like a banana boat a very small boat you can google that you will see those little boats that are used on the amazon river you know with all the anacondas and the alligators around you all those big spiders and all those those dangerous animals if you are younger you can easily escape from those animals but if you are my age and your pastor's age if you fell from that boat i mean how long will it take for me to swim away from oncoming anaconda coming behind me but if you are young amen god can use you hallelujah don't wait until you stand behind this desk and and then just wait until the past retires then you can start to preach here you have a big platform out there there's a huge pulpit outside there in all those remote areas i was just thinking about that and i said lord may our young people i was i was 12 years old young people when i started to do missionary work i was so young i did not understand everything but i was 12 years i went out of school and i started to work with my dad and all my life i have been doing that and i was young and i cried i moved fast i remember those years when i would go with dad and testify to people and dad would just you know open up the world and he would just try to convince the husband of the of the house and then the mother would put on the the kettle in the kitchen because she wants to warm up the water to burn the preacher you know she wants she's so fed up for this man in the house that she cannot stand listening to this missionary convincing her husband to be to accept the lord jesus christ to move out of his denomination so she goes into the kitchen say put on the water and she wants to you know she wants to burn people of i tell you brothers and sisters you know you need to be very fast you need to be very sharp you have to be sensitive you you you convince the man but you watch you you always rather repent you know the bible says repent and be blind you know you are quick you you but the wife is about to to to burn you i tell you i tell i i saw my dad fly as a young man hallelujah when the water would come his way he would be jumping from one side to the other side you know that's why young people say while you're young you know don't waste your time serve the lord and reach out amen reach out hallelujah get involved in a missionary program hallelujah and get to town and get to the corners of the street and tell people about jesus invite your friends to church invite somebody to come [Music] amen there are places the gospel needs you young people there are areas that some we brothers cannot go you know but you are strong and you are young and you can go to these places hello to do missionary work hallelujah and see how god can change the life of other people hallelujah and that is what i want to encourage our young people amen instead of just wasting time and and just hanging around and don't know what to do amen you idle around the devil will easily get a hold of you he will give you something to do the devil has a lot for you to do hallelujah and he has a lot in store for you amen and if you idle around you will he will definitely make use of you but before you use make use of your brother get yourself busy with the things of the lord i have been doing it for many years now and i just feel to do it another 20 years as long as the lord gives me the strength to do it and that's why i'm standing here today amen hallelujah aim and i can tell you that god is a life amen that is the same yesterday today and forever that is an unchangeable god hallelujah and i've never seen him fail i've never seen him fail hallelujah is always on time amen he's always on time hallelujah even if you have to wait a little bit longer he's always on time well he's the name of the lord i just i just i was so blessed you know i i i i be just at the end of the meetings as i traveled you know to the amazon the past you know wanted to give me an offering and you know i said to him pastor you know how can i i've been with you for so many weeks and i saw the situation in the country you know and it was just pressing me to take the offering and i said lord i cannot take the offering you know because you see the condition of the people you rather let them have the money and you know do something for for the brothers and sisters around the area and he just said no but nikki i cannot refuse you cannot refuse the offering and i took it and i said lord how can i have this offering while i'm here lord and knowing the needs are a bigger year than needs at home you know and that was about 1 500 dollars from poor people i said lord i cannot take this money i was about 9 000 rice brazilian rice about 1 dollars in cash i said lord i cannot take this money home what should i do with this money spoke to my wife and i said sweetheart i've been with these people you know i i don't know but i cannot take this money home she said i asked he said what should i do with the money she said to me okay let's walk on let's work on something she said what you do you had you have three translators there that have translated for you spanish and in portuguese tried to give each one of them a thousand then you know so so i put the money into my envelopes in my room and then i had i had no i two translators i gave them each one a thousand i had it in the envelope and i had about seven thousand left and the lord ministered to me there was a family that i have seen for the last for the few days that i've been there you know in one village and i had such a pull to them i had such a pull to that family and i also wondered why this pool and the lord just ministered to me to give the rest of the offering to the family and took seven thousand of that put it in one envelope and i closed the envelope and after the meetings it was my last meeting it was a sunday evening at the very sunday after that meeting i had to leave back three hours drive to terrazina and from there when i take a flight you know uh back to sao paulo but before i could get to sao paulo i had to take four flights out of the amazon to get to sao paulo so just before the service i asked my translator one of my brother's brothers from germany a young brother came to me he came actually to help to translate to me from germany a young brother he came to translate for me in portuguese and he i said to him brother carlos please brother now i will ask this family personal questions so please make sure you translate good for me because i wanted to know something i realized that they the situation was not good the brother works for foot for four forty forty dollars a month he drives on a scooter bike throughout delivering gas bottles so what can you do guys with forty dollars i'm talking about per month that's what he earns per month forty dollars a month i asked him a little bit questions and asked him about his house and he said to me nikki um we're staying in a little place here i saw the place it is it's not good you wouldn't even allow as brazil was always mentioning it in the camp meetings you only allow your dogs or your chickens to live in there but these are the areas that people lived in and i said do you have your own house he says no we have a we have a place a house but unfortunately we cannot stay in the house because of the condition of the house we don't have money and for for about seven years we have tried to save up money to see if we can get the house to be so we can get into the house and i said to him brother how much do you need to fix the house to get into your own house says so that your wife can start to prepare to have a baby i said to him goddess withhold this baby from you because you don't have your own place says brother i need about 5000. to be able to fix that building that little house and put some electricity in and fix it in and out so that we can get in and i went to my back and i said to brother i have something for you and i took out the envelope and i said to him here is seven thousand go home and fix your house says after these meetings you go home and fix the house and you and your wife start preparing for that miracle baby had you been waiting for eight years now god is gonna give you that baby hallelujah and in the meantime i was praying for god to provide for me because the car that i drive was already i need to replace my car i have to replace my car and i never realized that i was actually planting seed i'm a farmer i'm a farmer i know the principle of seed and what power lays within the seed and the energy that's in that sea to bring forth so if you doesn't know what it is to plant seed tonight you start tonight you start tomorrow because you cannot plant and not have a house i was praying for the lord to help me to have a a proper vehicle for the mission field because the one i'm driving now is about almost half a million kilometers on 500 000 kilometers on the clock it needs to be replaced and in the meantime god was waiting for me to plant the seed in my money that money would have been 48 000 and to have 48 000 in my country i could have take that offering and go home and maybe spend it or you know it's 48 000 but i invested it into the kingdom of god amen and i want to encourage you tonight brothers and sisters and this testimony is to encourage you and to build up your faith to realize that when you stand in the presence of god all things are possible just say the right word and what you ask shall be given to you amen there is nothing so comfortable is when you are a missionary remember i have been watching my dad for many years how you suffered with old cars in my country always his hands was full of oil many times he would come behind the desk and his hands will be pitch black oil under his nails and then he would come and preach one time one brother asked him are you a preacher or are you a mechanic it's not nice because always he has to be underneath the car fixing the car young people you know sometimes we would drive and the exhaust underneath will break into pieces then what we would do i will just try to get the can you know the scan the peanut butter cans the the metal ones i will just get one of those and i would cut it in the middle open it up like that and i would lay underneath and go and join those two pieces of the exhaust together and i would use that can bring it together use a wire here and a wire there and there we go then we can go from one meeting to another meeting and when you go to the next bomb the exhaust breaks again you know how great blessing it is when you are a missionary and you can get into a proper vehicle after you have so many meetings night after night you have to start a car and you get into it and you drive home maybe in a thousand miles or more but you know how painful it is when you have to open the bonnet and use a screw dryer to start a car you have to start it right there by the starter there's a little ball there and you connect that ball to the there's another bolt on the other side and you touch them like this [Laughter] you hold it and it goes and when it starts you close and you jump in [Music] and i said lord i'm your servant i need a good vehicle i need a strong car to get in and drive and preach the gospel amen i came from the amazon maybe you put up these lies brothers and give us more good quality here on the on the screen here because i want to give show you the testimony brother called i planned the seat and he said brother nikki i want to do something for you for the work of the lord and i want to bless you my brother so you go and collect your blessing without money without price but before that blessing could come i had to take one thousand five hundred dollars and give it to a family to get a little home fix right there in the deep amazon village put this on the screen the testimony brother i tell you i did not even had hours in this car i came i just you know i went to pick it and my little girl said to me daddy i want to go with you when you go to collect this miracle i want to go with you to collect this miracle i want to go with you i want to go you see there's no number placed on that car you say brother nikki you mean you mean that's the god i serve you see the other cars in the warehouse there i tell you brothers and sisters if you've ever seen a miracle there is one there is a miracle you don't have to buy america like that what money the blessing is put seed in the ground and god will let that harvest comes [Applause] you know pastor i am so excited to go home because i haven't driven the car i want to get behind that ceiling wheel and put on some kilos brothers and sisters i went to collect it with my little girl and we went back to the farm i took my luggage and i went back hallelujah to the airport and i parked in the airport and i flew to the united states i can't wait [Music] to enjoy this america and i want to tell you tonight whatever you need it is right in your reach is right in your reach it's right there if you believe tonight the same god that gave me that vehicle is the same god that can give you the desire of your heart you if you believe all things are possible and you receive it you can receive it tonight [Music] 605 000 rent how much dollars is that that's a lot of money some of you have to work many years to buy that car but you don't have to work hard for it you just have to plan the seat and remain faithful in the course that god has called you amen brothers and sisters we're serving an unchangeable god [Music] our message of tonight is keep that cow on the screen brother i want the brothers to look at it they must say lord oh i've been waiting so long for this blessing for my own blessing remember brothers and sisters luke chapter five luke chapter five peter he stood in a man he stood amongst many people but there came a time in his life where peter stood in the presence of god he stood in the presence of jehovah and all things were possible anything was about to happen i tell you tonight if you can stand one moment in his presence all your troubles are over i tell you all your troubles are over all your troubles are over you say brother i have never seen america i have never seen a miracle take a seat and put it in the soil and then you will see america regardless of the shape of their seed regardless of how rough and how small it is but i want to tell you tonight the power that lays what in that seat is so powerful brothers the potential that lays within that seed is so powerful there's no devil in hell that can withhold that seed to produce or bring up only what god has ordained that seed and there is no devil in hell that can stop you and me tonight to bring forth what god has ordained us to bring forth in this day [Music] peter said master remember i have told the whole night and nothing has happened yes you might say brother i have been praying for a long time but i want to say tonight you are standing in the presence of the supernatural you're standing in the presence of god tonight hallelujah no not one time yes anybody in the bible go to jesus and leave jesus the same the blind was you the crippled walk oh my every time jesus was saying earlier whenever he performed something happened how he cannot stand in his presence and go out the same i don't care what you need tonight i don't care what you need tonight or what the devil has told you i'm not i'm not one of those pentecostal preachers they're trying to work on your emotions and just stir you up i tell you tonight as a son of god hallelujah all things all things are possible hallelujah we are not a pentecostal church we are not a denomination we are not trying to stir people up we are not here to tell people and make you feel happy when we put on these pictures you say brother this is a pentecostal uh spirit that you have that's okay how can i how can i keep on watching these pentacles or churches testifying about what god has done for them those people are so happy those people almost have more faith than what we have sometimes those people they bring their testimony to church they bring their testimony to church they are they are on fire for the lord they believe hallelujah we're supposed to have more testimonies hallelujah because we have the presence of god we are the seed of abraham we are the seed of god brothers and sisters i mean if those people that not even have the message don't even have what we have tonight if they can have that faith what about me and you tonight we should be proud when god does something like this [Applause] you know sometimes you so afraid to give this kind of testimonies the brother said to me brother nikki people will not support your ministry anymore because you're giving these kind of testimonies it is not the people that support the ministry god is taking care god is taking care god is taking care god is the one i cannot stop telling about the goodness of god [Music] [Applause] don't let nobody stop you what god has done for you let nobody stop you you continue you go on you tell somebody [Applause] the prophet says mary did not wait until she could feel there was a baby no ways when she left the angel when the angel went his way and she went no way she went running telling the people that i angel of god she was standing in the presence
