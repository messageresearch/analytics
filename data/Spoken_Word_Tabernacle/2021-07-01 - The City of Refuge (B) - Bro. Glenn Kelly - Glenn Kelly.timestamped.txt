[13:41] [Music]
[13:46] jesus now

[14:05] amen you believe that tonight amen
[14:09] amen amen blessed be the name of the
[14:13] lord
[14:14] the lord knows everything yeah we
[14:18] in the room right on the middle and you
[14:19] didn't even have a space
[14:21] for a board and thank god why the
[14:24] kelly's preaching tonight
[14:25] [Laughter]
[14:27] amen i believe everybody got a cod book
[14:31] right are you reading it one question a
[14:35] day
[14:36] so you should be clamping higher
[14:39] amen you should have many of the answers
[14:43] begin to come up
[14:44] one by one before you know it you'll be
[14:47] soaring
[14:48] like eagles amen you
[14:51] remember the service this coming sunday
[14:55] i wanna accept the lord direct me
[14:58] differently
[14:59] but lord's willing we wanna we already
[15:01] prepare you
[15:02] on how the woman was created and the
[15:05] weakness of
[15:06] the body of the woman the mystery behind
[15:09] it
[15:10] and last sunday we talked about the
[15:13] the the last veil and how
[15:16] god gave the
[15:19] clothing in order to conceal the shape
[15:23] to conceal the woman to close the body
[15:26] and then to avoid any lust coming up so
[15:29] lord is willing this sunday
[15:31] to what i'm looking on the radar we
[15:33] should land on a high heel
[15:35] amen so you pray for me except the lord
[15:39] tells me something different
[15:40] but it's there i wanted to bring that on
[15:44] sunday when everybody is here
[15:47] it makes a difference when everybody's
[15:50] here
[15:50] amen so lord is willing you pray for the
[15:54] service and i pray that the lord will
[15:57] let you catch the revelation and you're
[16:00] going to see
[16:00] so whenever you want to buy your shoes
[16:02] you're just going to look at the shoes
[16:04] and you come up with your own conclusion
[16:06] whether this is suitable for me or this
[16:09] is not a suitable for me
[16:11] instead of me telling you it's going to
[16:12] be two millimeter three millimeter five
[16:14] millimeter six millimeter
[16:16] then we back again to the law amen
[16:20] the problem is not here
[16:24] the problem is high here
[16:27] not here it is high here
[16:31] amen but how high is the hill that's the
[16:36] problem
[16:37] so if we go to high high you is the hill
[16:40] we're going to be standing there with a
[16:42] measure tape
[16:44] which we're not going to do that amen
[16:48] so we want you to grasp the concept and
[16:50] see why
[16:52] the prophet was against it once you get
[16:54] it then you're going to understand
[16:56] what is going on and the lord willing
[16:58] everything will be clear
[17:00] so we must soar a little bit touch
[17:02] proverbs 7
[17:03] which you already know in detail touch
[17:06] first peter
[17:07] again and touch timothy then we go
[17:10] straight
[17:10] to isaiah 3 where it's leading so if you
[17:13] are behind
[17:14] on the sermon make sure you catch up
[17:18] because you're going to be lost amen if
[17:21] you ride on target we will be soaring
[17:23] easily and moving back and forth if not
[17:25] you're going to give me
[17:26] a double job to go back again and
[17:28] rehearse and make sure
[17:30] nobody's left behind amen so lord's
[17:33] willing depending on what they will be
[17:35] doing tomorrow
[17:37] if everything is completed tomorrow
[17:39] which i don't want to talk about it
[17:40] because it's on youtube
[17:43] if everything is completed tomorrow just
[17:46] beyond the loop you might receive a text
[17:48] from
[17:49] brother david will send a text and let
[17:51] you know
[17:52] that we might need help on saturday
[17:54] morning
[17:55] to put up certain things that i don't
[17:58] want to say on youtube
[18:00] so you know you have any questions ask
[18:02] the deacon ask the trustee they can give
[18:04] you
[18:05] plain detail ask brother greg who'll
[18:07] tell you what's going on up there
[18:09] so lord's willing just be on the loop
[18:12] you might receive a text if everything
[18:13] goes
[18:14] fine tomorrow it tells you what we
[18:16] expect on saturday
[18:17] we need some help and we can put up
[18:19] stuff and by the grace of god
[18:21] we're going to move to the next step and
[18:23] see how quick
[18:25] we can get into that building amen
[18:28] we appreciate all your prayer everything
[18:30] that you're doing so
[18:31] remember us in prayer we want to soar
[18:34] and be able to stop fellowshipping there
[18:36] and then continue with
[18:37] everything uh in the future so brother
[18:40] kelly's here i'm not going to take a lot

[26:28] of time
[26:29] let's start at verse uh seven verse
[26:33] seven
[26:33] it says and they appointed kadus in
[26:36] galilee
[26:37] in mount nephilia and shechem in mount
[26:40] ephraim and kurja arba
[26:44] which is hebron in the mountain of judah
[26:48] and on the other side of jordan by
[26:50] jericho eastwood
[26:52] they assigned bizarre in the wilderness
[26:55] upon the plane
[26:56] out of the tribe of reuben and raymath
[26:59] and gilead
[27:00] out of the tribe of gads says in golan
[27:04] in base son out of the tribe of manassas
[27:08] says now these were the cities appointed
[27:10] for all the children of israel
[27:12] and for the stranger that so joined
[27:15] among them
[27:16] that whosoever kill of any person and
[27:19] unawares
[27:20] might flee hither and not die by the
[27:23] hand of the avenger of blood
[27:25] until he stood before the congregation
[27:28] may the lord have a blessing to the
[27:30] reading of his word you know brother
[27:32] branham worked this in letting off the
[27:34] pressure
[27:36] he went in letting off the pressure but
[27:39] we know we're going to look at it
[27:40] a a little different but it's in that
[27:42] same message we're going to work with
[27:44] tonight
[27:44] the city of refuge we're going to look
[27:47] at the city of refuge
[27:49] because you know in letting off the
[27:51] pressure of time we thank god
[27:53] for a vindicated prophet in the end time
[27:56] because we know it's part of the
[27:57] scriptures it is
[27:59] being part of the scriptures all the
[28:01] scriptures is being fulfilled
[28:03] so you know we know we've been working
[28:04] with those demon forces and down and
[28:07] messages down in the soul but we asked
[28:09] them god gave us grace to
[28:11] just look into this little thought here
[28:13] tonight
[28:14] there's a city of refuge but you know
[28:17] let's look at
[28:18] all this pressure that's upon us now
[28:21] it's a lot of pressure in the world
[28:24] there's pressure on people from left to
[28:26] right left coming and going satan is
[28:29] trying
[28:30] to throw every fiery dart that he can
[28:33] after god's children so we know
[28:36] that people are raging and fussing and
[28:39] moving
[28:40] in the wrong way in the wrong spirits
[28:43] because they have to
[28:44] understand why god is doing what he's
[28:47] doing is that right
[28:49] god is moving because they they even
[28:51] know
[28:52] that it's getting near the end time the
[28:55] sinner know that is in time
[28:57] they're doing more drinking they're
[28:59] doing more drugging
[29:01] they're doing more whoring they're doing
[29:03] more with all the things that stealing
[29:05] and they're doing more partying they're
[29:07] doing all these things to the flesh
[29:10] because they know we don't have long to
[29:13] get out of here
[29:14] is that right so we know that winners
[29:16] are revival the bride
[29:18] knows that it's a revival going on
[29:21] because it's going on within her
[29:23] so when that revival is going on is also
[29:26] a devil is rising up is that right
[29:29] but jesus promised to us that he would
[29:32] never leave
[29:33] us or forsake us is that right so we
[29:36] just want to look at this city these
[29:38] cities of refuge
[29:40] and we want you to look at it we don't
[29:42] won't plan to be long
[29:44] but we want you to understand that it is
[29:46] a place of refuge is that right
[29:49] and we know we are in that place of
[29:51] refuge is that right
[29:53] we know we as believers you know about
[29:56] repentance is that right
[29:57] we remember i know remember the last
[29:59] thing when brother chad said
[30:01] and that he when he finished up he also
[30:04] threw in that this
[30:05] is was what this is a message of
[30:08] reconciliation is that right
[30:10] so that means we know that god has sent
[30:13] us after lost souls is that right
[30:16] so now that's why you're being taught
[30:18] the way you're being taught
[30:19] but god has also told us that now the
[30:22] pastor
[30:23] is here god has given us a gift is that
[30:26] right
[30:27] that to fulfill his scripture to fulfill
[30:30] because he said that you had to have
[30:32] a fivefold ministry he said you had to
[30:35] have an apostle
[30:37] you had a prophet a pastor a teacher
[30:40] and an evangelist is that right
[30:43] different ministries
[30:44] so now god for what for the perfecting
[30:47] for the maturing
[30:49] of the saints is that right in this end
[30:51] time so we can't just have just the
[30:53] tapes is that right
[30:55] and some wants to come in here and think
[30:57] that we're being
[30:58] uh kind of aggressive because we're
[31:00] speaking against those things
[31:02] no we are earnestly contending for the
[31:05] faith
[31:06] that was once delivered to the saints is
[31:08] that right
[31:09] so that's why you have your pastor
[31:12] coming led by the holy ghost
[31:14] that's we doing what restored restoring
[31:17] god said he promised
[31:18] i shall restore what the palmer worm the
[31:21] cankerworm the caterpillar the locusts
[31:23] have eaten up is that right
[31:25] so we know what the catholic church on
[31:27] what the methodist
[31:29] but the lutheran what's the pentecostal
[31:31] is that right
[31:32] this is the pentecostal age but we have
[31:35] the pentecostal experience is that right
[31:37] god came and exposed and showed us it
[31:40] was not just the restoration of the gift
[31:42] is that right
[31:43] but it was the opening of the word is
[31:46] that right on the world
[31:47] on the road of emmaus jesus came in what
[31:51] broke the scriptures to them he didn't
[31:53] just break the scriptures to him
[31:55] he broke it with understanding is that
[31:58] right
[31:59] so now you can move so when your
[32:01] understanding comes
[32:02] your confidence comes like brother bruce
[32:04] spoke last week
[32:06] confidence is that right then your
[32:08] confidence comes is that right
[32:09] and your faith is a what faith is a
[32:11] revelation is that right
[32:13] when i return to the earth shall i find
[32:16] what
[32:16] faith on the earth so we just want to
[32:18] lay this foundation
[32:20] because it's a mess going on out there
[32:22] now but what are we doing
[32:23] we are sighing and crying for the
[32:26] condition of this land
[32:28] is that right because one of our loved
[32:30] ones
[32:31] one of our brothers one of our sisters
[32:34] are among the children of disobedience
[32:36] is that right
[32:37] don't never give up on nothing they are
[32:41] not disobedient
[32:42] they are among the children of
[32:44] disobedience because god
[32:46] says we are sons and daughters of the
[32:49] most high
[32:49] god and we're moving in the authority
[32:52] under the baptism of the holy ghost
[32:54] we know when you're going and seeking a
[32:56] soul they must do what
[32:58] repent is that right
[33:02] now who don't know about repentance we
[33:03] know that right and then they have to be
[33:05] what
[33:06] justified is that right after they are
[33:08] justified
[33:10] if they have to be sanctified if they
[33:12] didn't fill with the holy ghost is that
[33:14] right
[33:14] now god we have an order that god has
[33:17] given
[33:18] us to go out and win those souls you
[33:20] have to have a burning desire
[33:25] you have to have a burning desire down
[33:27] in your soul
[33:29] for a lost soul
[33:32] let us come that's why somebody's
[33:33] getting stagnated
[33:36] oh god get ready to ambush you you're
[33:38] getting stagnated
[33:39] because you're not going out telling
[33:41] what you are receiving
[33:42] is that right if you go out and you tell
[33:45] it you believe it is that right
[33:46] you can't cast to catch a fish unless
[33:49] you cast the net
[33:50] or cast to ride and it got to be the
[33:52] kind of what bait
[33:53] that they like is that right so you have
[33:56] to listen
[33:58] listen to what they're talking about
[34:01] you're in the workforce
[34:02] it has to be a love of faith that's
[34:05] working by
[34:06] love you can i am not ashamed of the
[34:09] gospel
[34:09] of jesus christ that's why the whole
[34:12] world
[34:12] needs jesus
[34:18] look what he says he says now
[34:22] a refuge is a shelter
[34:26] it's a protection from danger
[34:29] now all these cities there was up on a
[34:32] hill
[34:33] i won't have time to get into all that
[34:35] you got to go because there's a lot in
[34:37] this
[34:38] so we're just going to guess god to give
[34:40] us grace to hit those
[34:41] high points those cities was up on the
[34:43] hill but remember moses
[34:45] first says god gave them moses the right
[34:48] to three
[34:49] cities refuge cities but when joshua and
[34:52] them now and got into that in the
[34:53] heritage and to the land
[34:55] god gave him three more cities on the
[34:57] west side is that right
[34:58] he had three on the east side had three
[35:01] on the west side
[35:02] we're going to find out tonight if
[35:04] you're really in christ
[35:05] huh this is self-examining time those
[35:08] were just not
[35:09] cities these were cities with particular
[35:12] names
[35:12] these cities meant something that god
[35:14] went in there that's why we need cities
[35:16] of refuge is that right
[35:18] we know the city of refuge to us is our
[35:21] high priestess who
[35:22] jesus christ is that right but this was
[35:25] the land
[35:26] cities the lands of the leviticus is
[35:28] that right they had to be a
[35:30] priest to be in this land okay
[35:32] hallelujah
[35:34] glory be to god he said now these are
[35:37] the shelter protection
[35:39] of a place and and here
[35:43] i want you to look at and let me go to
[35:45] the scriptures first let's go to romans
[35:47] 8
[35:47] then i'll read to you what the prophet
[35:49] said so you can see
[35:51] by his grace and his mercy where he's
[35:53] getting it from by god's grace
[35:56] he says now we have to realize things
[35:58] that we're in a war
[36:00] we're in a real war and as the word
[36:03] continue to unfold
[36:05] unless you are born again i don't order
[36:08] another spirit
[36:09] you won't be you're no match for the
[36:11] devil i'm no match for the devil none of
[36:13] us no match for the devil but jesus
[36:14] christ is is that right
[36:16] he's given us the authority now to live
[36:19] a victorious life
[36:20] we are not to be living a down beat up
[36:23] life even through our transgressions
[36:25] we'll do what rejoice
[36:26] because we have promises from god is
[36:28] that right
[36:29] hallelujah look what he said romans 8
[36:33] and 1. he says a familiar scripture
[36:36] there is therefore now
[36:37] what no condemnation to them that
[36:40] we're at walk not after the war
[36:44] but after the war no condemnation
[36:47] new can bring any charge against god's
[36:49] elect
[36:50] nobody can bring any charge against
[36:52] godzilla
[36:54] hallelujah i'm trying to remember you
[36:56] brother caleb hallelujah
[36:58] look what we got here he said now look
[37:01] drop down
[37:02] to verse 34. he says
[37:06] who is he that condemneth
[37:10] it is christ that died see ye rather
[37:13] that
[37:14] that is risen again who is even at the
[37:17] right hand of god
[37:18] who also make a direct intercession for
[37:21] us
[37:22] so you see christ's faith living he
[37:24] loved me dying he saved me buried he
[37:26] carried my sins far away
[37:28] now what is what is with us we have the
[37:31] resurrected christ
[37:33] living with us see he said i'll be with
[37:37] you and inside of you until the
[37:39] end of the world so last time when we
[37:42] were here
[37:43] that's why we don't have time to fuss
[37:46] we don't have time to go back and forth
[37:49] the lord
[37:50] showed us he's blinding them
[37:53] he's making them think that they have
[37:55] something just as much as we have
[37:58] okay but god's doing it you want to keep
[38:02] your blindness on and stay focused to
[38:04] what god sent
[38:05] us to do that's all we're here to do
[38:08] so god is now what he's doing he's
[38:11] cleaning up
[38:13] some of you may try to accuse him with
[38:15] the uh uh
[38:16] the pastor some of them tried to accuse
[38:18] us as being a legalistic
[38:20] thing no no no no no no no joshua the
[38:23] ministry of
[38:24] zoster and zerubbabel was given the
[38:26] order remember when akan and them got
[38:28] into the land
[38:30] and god said what it came to design
[38:33] a babylonian garment he was designed to
[38:36] covenant that thing in his heart
[38:38] that's why i was saying you gotta where
[38:41] there's no desire
[38:42] there's no temptation you gotta cash
[38:45] down every
[38:46] imagination that try to exalt itself
[38:49] against the word of god
[38:50] that's why david said i keep the lord
[38:53] before me
[38:54] at all times i meditate on thy word
[38:58] day and night
[39:01] more children he's building something
[39:03] here
[39:04] god's bringing us into something see
[39:06] though see the law was others
[39:07] the law was just a school master he kept
[39:11] us until now we're moving into the grace
[39:13] of god
[39:14] that's been extended to us in this end
[39:16] time
[39:17] so it was all by predestination for our
[39:20] knowledge
[39:21] so children god and you may not appear
[39:23] to be anything
[39:24] you may be appeared to be struggling but
[39:27] don't worry about
[39:28] it you're going to be just like him when
[39:31] he comes is that right hallelujah
[39:36] that's what we're going to have and look
[39:39] verse 35 he says who shall separate us
[39:42] from the love of christ
[39:45] shall tribulation huh no distress
[39:50] no see that's what he's trying to tell
[39:51] him or persecution
[39:53] or famine or nerkiness or pearls
[39:58] or sir or sword see who shall separate
[40:01] us see nothing can separate us from the
[40:03] love of god
[40:04] because now why because the ephesus age
[40:08] they fell from their first love is that
[40:10] right
[40:11] but in this age god restored his people
[40:14] back to his first love so you love the
[40:18] word
[40:18] you love to hear the word that's why
[40:22] god have you sitting here now he saved
[40:24] the best for last
[40:26] is that right so you don't have to worry
[40:29] about
[40:29] anything he said what shall i hide from
[40:32] abraham
[40:32] nothing because i know that he will keep
[40:35] my commandment
[40:36] and raise his children according to my
[40:38] word
[40:39] and ain't that what he's saying you are
[40:41] the royal seed of abraham
[40:43] you got god's blood you were saved by
[40:47] god's blood
[40:48] you are redeemed by god's blood who can
[40:51] bring any charge

[41:00] are god's elector no weapons conformed
[41:03] against you comprised
[41:06] who who can counsel god who got to
[41:09] oversay god

[48:02] how the spirit could come the other week
[48:03] say oh yes pharisees spirit i said yeah
[48:06] okay uh-huh yeah yeah i ain't got time

[48:14] time first with you no more
[48:15] i'll pray for you and i love you look
[48:17] what he says here
[48:18] brother branham talked about this here
[48:21] he said you're seeing what the people
[48:22] need
[48:23] he said and now not to stand
[48:27] before you just saying not to stand
[48:28] before some congregation
[48:30] but he was just letting you know that we
[48:32] as ministers we just don't come just to
[48:34] be preaching
[48:35] and when you come because you come for
[48:37] the need to help god's people
[48:39] there's god to give us something this is
[48:42] not a show
[48:43] he says see the name of the lord is a
[48:46] what
[48:46] a strong tower a tower also is a refuge
[48:51] a tower also is a pulpit
[48:54] so the word of the lord come from the
[48:56] pupil
[48:57] is from god from this throne from his
[48:59] throne to this throne
[49:01] to your throne that's god's order this
[49:04] is not a show
[49:05] he's building a spiritual house saints
[49:07] and you are the one that he chose to be
[49:09] victorious in this life the city of
[49:12] refuge
[49:13] we're going to see what the prophets say
[49:15] about this city of refuge
[49:18] hallelujah he said what is he saying all
[49:22] this together
[49:23] this tension is built up it's just
[49:25] tension built up around here
[49:27] tension on people you say something
[49:30] people
[49:30] people money got them running gambling
[49:33] got them running
[49:34] pornography got them running thinking
[49:37] got them running
[49:38] but just tension these jobs is just
[49:40] working these forces
[49:42] with less people the job's got pressure
[49:44] on it's just
[49:45] pressure but satan is the prince of this
[49:48] world it's satan that's putting the
[49:49] pressure on the people
[49:51] it's satan that's putting the pressure
[49:52] on your father it's satan that's putting
[49:54] the pressure on your mother
[49:56] it's satan that's putting the pressure
[49:57] on your guardian it's satan is trying to
[49:59] put the pressure on the ministry
[50:01] but when you get down and you pray is
[50:03] that right when you get down and you
[50:05] pray
[50:06] you get on offense of prayer when you
[50:08] get on an offensive prayer
[50:10] you start praying thanking god for his
[50:13] grace
[50:13] thanking god for his mercy then you
[50:16] start binding up the sorcery demons
[50:18] sprouting up the lust demons biting up
[50:20] the religious demons you start
[50:22] binding them up sending them back to
[50:24] where they come from you
[50:26] shake satan's force his kingdom
[50:29] hallelujah look what he says
[50:32] now he says there's tension of the devil
[50:35] over the whole world
[50:36] but what is the answer for the world
[50:39] jesus christ that's exactly right
[50:41] jesus christ is the place of refuge
[50:43] jesus christ is the city of refuge
[50:46] is that right we're working this message
[50:48] says this is still the message
[50:50] letting off the pressure the prophet of
[50:51] god preached this five times
[50:54] but this here we want you to see what is
[50:56] going on so you'll understand
[50:58] you got to really fight in prayer it's
[51:00] just like
[51:01] the pastor said he said when you get
[51:03] your conduct in order
[51:05] oh you're going to find out that
[51:06] conducting order you remember when the
[51:08] holy spirit ministered
[51:09] that we were in the back of god's mind
[51:11] before the foundation of the world
[51:14] that's in conduct and order well when
[51:16] are we talking about all those
[51:18] um demon forces that was in them pigs
[51:20] and swine where'd they go
[51:22] them demon forces that was in them pigs
[51:24] in them swine
[51:25] they're in people now they're in people
[51:28] that's in your word
[51:29] conducting order is that right and so we
[51:32] have to understand now
[51:33] when you pray there's 200 million demon
[51:36] plus demons loose
[51:38] there's going to be a challenge to
[51:40] praying sometimes
[51:41] that's in that conducting order so you
[51:44] got to
[51:45] understand don't let anyone try to pull
[51:48] you away
[51:49] from your time with the lord is that
[51:51] right because if you
[51:52] if you don't spend your time with the
[51:55] lord like you're supposed to
[51:56] he's going to spank you that's all he's
[51:59] not going to lose you he's going to
[52:00] spank you
[52:01] just like a father would do a child is
[52:03] that right when they become disobedience
[52:06] so we have to understand that god has
[52:08] called us
[52:09] for a work a labor in love he said put
[52:12] on the whole what
[52:13] armor of god so that we may be able to
[52:16] do what
[52:17] withstand the wilds the trickeries
[52:20] of the devils in the end time see how
[52:22] merciful he is to us
[52:24] he told him over in the corinthians you
[52:26] know the corinthians
[52:27] always wanted to major on the minor they
[52:30] want to major on the gifts is that right
[52:32] so they want to make so god could only
[52:34] tell them the weapons of our warfare are
[52:37] not
[52:37] what car nor is that right but mighty
[52:40] through god that's all he could tell
[52:41] them but when he came to ephesus
[52:44] he told him what the weapons were is
[52:46] that right so he held he can give this a
[52:48] little more
[52:49] now he's pulled his bride aside brother
[52:52] greg
[52:52] and he's opening up the whole
[52:54] heart to his bride is that right
[52:57] jesus was the fullness of god so we are
[53:00] looking in this hour here now
[53:01] into the word of god the fullness of the
[53:04] word of god
[53:06] don't be ashamed of the gospel saints
[53:08] you will not
[53:09] fail god cannot fail god did not choose
[53:12] you to fail
[53:14] what the devil is doing as the holy
[53:15] ghost been saying he's trying to make
[53:17] you feel bad about your nose
[53:22] he's trying to make you feel bad about
[53:24] your ears
[53:26] he's trying to make you feel bad about
[53:28] the color of your skin
[53:31] he's trying to make you feel bad about
[53:33] the way you shake
[53:35] he's trying to make you feel bad about
[53:37] your height
[53:38] but god don't make no mistakes is that
[53:41] right huh
[53:42] god don't make no mistake sir you don't
[53:45] have to with them
[53:46] you know where the fella they used to
[53:47] pick at me too i used to want to grow an
[53:49] afro when i was in the world
[53:51] you know and my hair wasn't groping
[53:53] right about that high
[53:54] and so you know they used to pick at you
[53:56] they call you t.w.a
[53:58] you know what t.w.a was in the world
[54:00] teeny weeny afro
[54:02] and so they would just pick the world as
[54:05] cruel you know what
[54:06] and you got to put up with them you got
[54:08] to put up with them is that right
[54:09] you can't get pulled on their side then
[54:11] one day god gave me a word brother you
[54:14] know what he told me
[54:15] you better be careful god made me
[54:18] and god don't like you picking at his
[54:20] children
[54:22] huh it's best for you just to
[54:25] say nothing at all so god give you a
[54:28] word
[54:28] of wisdom isn't that what he said it's
[54:30] best for you to hang a chain
[54:32] in the middle stone around your neck and
[54:35] cast yourself in the sea
[54:36] then to touch one of god's children
[54:38] you're in trouble
[54:39] huh hallelujah the world is cruel
[54:43] the crew don't don't don't let the world
[54:45] don't try to pull yourself into the
[54:46] world
[54:47] don't try to get caught up with the
[54:48] world don't try to dress like the world
[54:51] the world wanted the world seeing
[54:53] something in you
[54:55] huh he sees something to you that he won
[54:58] then that brother branham said
[54:59] when a young rich ruler what did he have
[55:02] humble steve he had religion
[55:04] is that right he had religion he said
[55:07] when he saw
[55:08] jesus i'm gonna slow down a little bit
[55:10] brother
[55:11] when he got around in there and the
[55:14] young rich ruler
[55:16] he saw jesus and jesus came and he ran
[55:20] to him and he said what must i do
[55:23] to be saved he said he fell down on it
[55:27] said all your goods give the money to
[55:30] the poor
[55:31] he said he walked away sad and he walked
[55:34] away
[55:34] sad but see how close it was it would
[55:37] have deceived the very elect if it was
[55:39] possible
[55:40] the only one knew that he had religion
[55:42] was jesus
[55:43] the other one started he had salvation
[55:45] he was on his way to heaven
[55:47] but that's what we were warned against
[55:49] now is those religious demons
[55:52] but brother branham said what it was was
[55:54] he saw
[55:55] a character in jesus
[55:59] that he knew he did not have
[56:02] he's looking at the character that's in
[56:05] his bride
[56:07] that he did not have you see so that's
[56:10] what satan is trying to
[56:11] pull you in by the flesh is that right
[56:14] it's that character saints
[56:16] you look at you ain't got to answer the
[56:18] devil every time you say something
[56:20] huh you got to answer you look at him
[56:22] sometime
[56:24] look at him and when he went to fuss and
[56:27] he asked you something
[56:27] oh brother i don't know yeah yeah
[56:31] i don't know brother
[56:34] you answer him truthfully see he can't
[56:37] handle the truth
[56:38] jesus said i am the way i am the truth
[56:41] and i am the life
[56:44] no man no man
[56:47] can come to the father unless they come
[56:49] through me
[56:53] jesus is the answer here's the place of
[56:55] refuge
[56:57] he said now in the world no they know
[56:59] that they're wrong
[57:01] he says i'm going to read this anyway so
[57:03] you know what the prophet said
[57:05] he says and he couldn't stop nowhere
[57:09] see let me see says if he done
[57:12] something accidentally i'll start let me
[57:14] go up
[57:16] if you're writing it down is that
[57:18] paragraph 56
[57:20] on um letting off the pressure it says
[57:24] now in the old testament there was a
[57:26] time when a man could build up pressure
[57:29] way back there and that was when he done
[57:32] something wrong
[57:33] if he showed innocent blood then he was
[57:36] on the run see because as soon as that
[57:40] man that he killed or the wrong he did
[57:43] that man he did the wrong to some of his
[57:46] people would hunt him until they found
[57:48] him
[57:49] and they killed him it was a tooth for a
[57:52] tooth and an
[57:52] eye for an eye see he had no place to
[57:55] stop
[57:56] he says if he'd done something
[57:58] accidentally
[58:00] he says and then if you want to write it
[58:02] down you can go over to
[58:04] deuteronomy i mean numbers 35 and also
[58:07] in 20
[58:08] i'm trying to for the sake of time i'm
[58:10] trying not to turn all those scriptures
[58:12] he says he could not stop nowhere he was
[58:14] the future ted
[58:15] he didn't know what to do he said a very
[58:19] type of today
[58:20] he said i think that's what's causing so
[58:22] much pressure
[58:24] we're on the run that's what the matter
[58:27] with the world
[58:28] knowing they're wrong knowing knowing
[58:31] that
[58:32] the coming of the lord is at hand see
[58:34] now this is the prophet
[58:37] they know the coming of the lord is at
[58:39] hand
[58:40] we know that they're thirsting for who
[58:43] god
[58:44] we know we got the goods we don't
[58:46] believe we're the one that got the goods
[58:49] for him
[58:49] don't be ashamed of your gospel
[58:53] he said well you are ashamed because
[58:55] you're not
[58:56] sure
[59:01] that's the only way you got to be sure
[59:04] you got to be no you know that you are
[59:07] the elect of god
[59:09] you know that god have chosen you you
[59:11] know these things
[59:13] you have god watching of you all heaven
[59:15] is watching over us
[59:17] heaven and earth jesus christ is not
[59:19] only with you
[59:20] he's inside of you is that right so we
[59:24] got to get
[59:24] all we're trying to get them do is what
[59:26] is to christ is that right
[59:28] you they can't make their self bride no
[59:32] way you can make their self bright but
[59:34] we can get them into christ is that
[59:36] right
[59:37] because we have to remember what's going
[59:39] to happen they said well brother where
[59:40] they going to be at
[59:41] on the throne where are they going to be
[59:43] at i think some are going to make it
[59:46] be in heaven but they're going to be
[59:49] out there they're not going to be on the
[59:51] throne with us
[59:53] we're the pride we're going to be
[59:55] sitting on the throne you see
[59:57] this serious thing so that's why we can
[1:00:00] tell them about christ
[1:00:02] we can tell them about the goodness of
[1:00:04] the lord we can tell them about the
[1:00:06] blood
[1:00:06] or what jesus christ has done for us on
[1:00:09] calvary
[1:00:10] because we are pressing our way on
[1:00:12] that's why he said restore
[1:00:14] the joy now the word is being restored
[1:00:17] now so by the word being restored your
[1:00:20] joy is to be restored also
[1:00:23] nobody wants to be drawn into a dead
[1:00:25] religion
[1:00:27] wouldn't be sure about that hallelujah
[1:00:30] let me keep reading
[1:00:32] he said now it's the type of what's
[1:00:35] causing so much pressure
[1:00:37] we're on the one that's what's the
[1:00:39] matter with the world
[1:00:40] knowing they're wrong knowing the coming
[1:00:43] of the lord is at hand
[1:00:44] and the pressure is building up it says
[1:00:47] and there on the run
[1:00:49] rose roadhouse gambling dens
[1:00:53] luxury sin immorality
[1:00:57] decay anything that you name to give
[1:01:00] what to give bit he said listen
[1:01:01] to a tv a dirty joke anything
[1:01:04] get vent they're on the run there's
[1:01:07] something
[1:01:08] fixing to happen he says they know it
[1:01:12] and they're drinking and they're
[1:01:13] drinking themselves to death
[1:01:16] with pleasure and everything else on the
[1:01:18] run
[1:01:19] he says they know there's something
[1:01:21] fixing to happen
[1:01:22] the world speaks of it we know that
[1:01:25] something is fixing to happen
[1:01:27] the world may be blown up before
[1:01:30] daylight every nation is under tension
[1:01:34] every nation is under tension because
[1:01:37] some knucklehead
[1:01:38] can push the button at any time is that
[1:01:41] right
[1:01:42] that's why they're going to run around
[1:01:43] people are being deceived is that right
[1:01:45] if you look at it you you look at the um
[1:01:48] i'm obama ahab
[1:01:49] he he agreed i typed him with a hat he
[1:01:52] wasn't running nothing he was a jelly
[1:01:53] back
[1:01:54] when they get around in there you got to
[1:01:56] understand when you turn to
[1:01:58] when when you look at this situation
[1:02:00] that we're in now
[1:02:02] we have to realize our number one i mean
[1:02:04] israel
[1:02:05] or allies he agrees to
[1:02:08] the number one enemy he signed and
[1:02:11] agreed
[1:02:11] for them to get atomic weapons is that
[1:02:14] right
[1:02:14] so you have to understand and pay
[1:02:16] attention to what god is doing right now
[1:02:19] you got on the supreme court there's no
[1:02:22] more
[1:02:23] protestants all you got is basically
[1:02:25] jews seven
[1:02:26] jews and i think the two are catholics
[1:02:28] i'm not sure
[1:02:29] i mean uh two are jews i think the
[1:02:31] others are catholics
[1:02:32] but anyway on the supreme courts you've
[1:02:35] got majority catholic votes on there now
[1:02:39] they're right here in the midst the
[1:02:40] things that the prophet told
[1:02:42] us it's not coming it's here now
[1:02:45] it's right in the midst and you god
[1:02:49] fought so much of you the prophet of god
[1:02:52] says
[1:02:53] america need more missionaries than any
[1:02:57] place in the world
[1:02:58] and god has put you in heaven never with
[1:03:02] the sinner
[1:03:03] you are right in the midst of it they're
[1:03:05] all around you
[1:03:07] come on saints god have put you here
[1:03:10] then put you in africa he didn't put you
[1:03:12] in the islands
[1:03:13] he didn't put you somewhere else he put
[1:03:15] you here for
[1:03:16] earnestly content for the faith of god
[1:03:23] look what he says hallelujah he says no
[1:03:26] matter
[1:03:27] just she says one time let me skip that
[1:03:31] for the grace for the sake of time
[1:03:33] because we want to get to those refuge
[1:03:35] he said now look
[1:03:38] in old testament god seeing in some of
[1:03:40] some of this
[1:03:41] trouble was as god was seeing
[1:03:44] some of this trouble was accidentally he
[1:03:47] knew it was accidentally
[1:03:49] so if you're innocent and not guilty
[1:03:53] god makes a way for you
[1:03:56] that's why it's people i've seen them
[1:03:58] locked up
[1:04:00] that's a terrible thing to be locked up
[1:04:02] there was one brother i won't say
[1:04:04] name but it was a situation before they
[1:04:06] locked the institutions down because the
[1:04:08] kovic
[1:04:10] he had been locked up at the time going
[1:04:11] on eight years
[1:04:13] and he was on death row they was going
[1:04:17] to execute him
[1:04:19] and he kept telling him he was innocent
[1:04:22] and they found out he was innocent
[1:04:24] and he was innocent the grace of god
[1:04:28] but i tell you and he knew god blessed
[1:04:30] him
[1:04:31] and richly blessed him and every time
[1:04:33] someone coming in
[1:04:34] he would always remind them pray for me
[1:04:39] keep me up in prayer think about those
[1:04:42] people that you work around those people
[1:04:43] that you see
[1:04:44] how many of y'all that they've come to
[1:04:46] you and said pray for me
[1:04:49] keep me up in prayer they recognizing
[1:04:51] something that the
[1:04:52] young rich ruler recognized they
[1:04:54] recognize there's something
[1:04:55] inside of you they recognizing that you
[1:04:59] have a spirit of character about you
[1:05:01] they recognize that you can get in touch
[1:05:03] with god
[1:05:04] for them they recognizing that you are
[1:05:06] maybe labor for hours for them
[1:05:08] they recognize you hun brother polycarp
[1:05:11] hallelujah brother
[1:05:12] they recognizing that that prayer will
[1:05:15] do what
[1:05:16] that you can break through is that right
[1:05:18] we have a high preach
[1:05:19] that cannot be touched by the what the
[1:05:22] feelings of our infirmities is that
[1:05:24] right
[1:05:25] jesus is the answer for the world today
[1:05:28] seeing this in these cities of refuge
[1:05:31] these were high priests but they just
[1:05:33] went but stood in the gap for them
[1:05:36] is that right but jesus came to our high
[1:05:38] priesthood
[1:05:39] at melchizedek he made a way that we can
[1:05:41] do what
[1:05:42] go on through is that right let's go
[1:05:45] over to hebrews for a minute
[1:05:49] hebrews 6
[1:05:52] and we get into the cities hebrews 6.
[1:05:56] look what the look what christ if that's
[1:05:58] what brother branham was talking about
[1:05:59] in that hidden life
[1:06:00] when you go in that hidden life in that
[1:06:03] message ahead in life
[1:06:05] you're a hidden in life you are now no
[1:06:08] condemnation
[1:06:09] you are now in christ jesus and when you
[1:06:12] can go in there
[1:06:13] and you can live that life every day but
[1:06:16] what's happening is
[1:06:17] the reason why we're up and down and i'm
[1:06:19] guilty at times too
[1:06:20] the devil catch you when you ain't
[1:06:22] prayed up you see that's when it gets
[1:06:24] you
[1:06:24] when you ain't prayed up he coming he
[1:06:27] recognized that
[1:06:28] so we have to understand sometimes that
[1:06:30] lord
[1:06:31] if it takes just five minutes stop lord
[1:06:34] have
[1:06:34] mercy on me god i had to rush up out of
[1:06:36] here with my child
[1:06:38] i had to go over here lord and the mercy
[1:06:40] came up father
[1:06:41] but you know i always meet with you have
[1:06:44] mercy on me father and god i have mercy
[1:06:46] on you at that time
[1:06:48] is that right because he know your heart
[1:06:50] look what he says
[1:06:51] let's say hebrew what was the sixth
[1:06:54] hallelujah
[1:06:56] for the sake of time let's look at these
[1:06:58] uh let's look at verse
[1:07:00] 17 hebrews 6 and 17
[1:07:04] it says wearing god willing more
[1:07:06] abundantly to show unto the heirs
[1:07:08] of promise the what immobility
[1:07:11] of his what counsel confirmed it by what
[1:07:15] by an oath you don't have to worry about
[1:07:18] anything anything you read in that bible
[1:07:22] and god said it he will not
[1:07:26] change it there's a promise you can hold
[1:07:29] on to it
[1:07:30] if god said it so we don't say it
[1:07:33] proudly but we can go
[1:07:34] boldly to the throne of god god you said
[1:07:39] you said you never leave or forsake me
[1:07:41] you said
[1:07:42] you take the promises to god right back
[1:07:45] to god
[1:07:46] you don't go to god as a beggar you are
[1:07:49] sons and daughters of the most high god
[1:07:53] is that right you come lifting him up
[1:07:56] you address him
[1:07:57] as the majesty you adjust him
[1:08:00] as the excellent one you adjust him as
[1:08:03] the almighty god
[1:08:04] you address him as king of kings you
[1:08:07] address him
[1:08:08] as lord of the lord you address him as
[1:08:11] the almighty
[1:08:13] he's the one hey
[1:08:16] that's our god that's our god
[1:08:20] look what he says hallelujah
[1:08:23] he said look in verse 18 he said that by
[1:08:27] two immutable things
[1:08:28] in which it was impossible for god to
[1:08:31] lie
[1:08:32] we might have a strong consolation
[1:08:35] who have fled for what refugees give us
[1:08:38] a place a refuge
[1:08:42] he said look to lay hold upon the hope
[1:08:45] set before
[1:08:46] us you see that he gave you a place
[1:08:50] to know that divides justification
[1:08:52] sanctification
[1:08:54] baptism of the holy ghost giving us the
[1:08:56] earnest
[1:08:57] we know that we got a place waiting on
[1:09:00] us
[1:09:00] a heavenly place eternal life is that
[1:09:03] right
[1:09:04] hallelujah look what he's saying

[1:09:09] sinner like me
[1:09:11] that was down in the world huh
[1:09:14] they were hitting me i was hidden hidden
[1:09:17] in the sinful world
[1:09:19] and god had us there hiding in our
[1:09:21] raunchy lives
[1:09:22] is that right look what he did huh but
[1:09:25] we
[1:09:25] all gracious merciful god knew deep down
[1:09:29] inside is that right
[1:09:30] we was like a lily is that right huh
[1:09:33] like a lady coming through the married
[1:09:35] class is that right
[1:09:37] they thought we was gonna the devil
[1:09:39] thought he had us
[1:09:40] the devil thought he had us beat he
[1:09:42] thought he had us in drugging
[1:09:44] he finally had us in drinking he finally
[1:09:46] had us in smoking he thought he had us
[1:09:48] in hormones had he had thought he had us
[1:09:51] in pornography he thought he had us
[1:09:52] stealing
[1:09:53] he thought he had us doing those
[1:09:55] unrighteous things but what he didn't
[1:09:57] know brother steve

[1:13:50] and reading your bible every day praying
[1:13:53] and reading your bible
[1:13:55] and the pastor didn't put pressure on
[1:13:58] you
[1:13:58] and the conduct an order just read one
[1:14:00] every day
[1:14:01] you know some of you younger generations
[1:14:03] you know when
[1:14:04] when i started work we didn't have
[1:14:06] computers
[1:14:08] we had paper everything was paper and i
[1:14:10] do paper
[1:14:12] and boy i hated them computing you see
[1:14:13] why i got that paper up here don't you
[1:14:15] he said i hate them computers sitting
[1:14:18] around in there
[1:14:19] i thank god for my wife though because
[1:14:21] she'll be helping me along the way
[1:14:23] i'm learning but we get over that you
[1:14:25] know the lady told me at work she said
[1:14:28] you do
[1:14:28] one thing every time you come to work
[1:14:32] on the computer one thing she said
[1:14:34] that's five things you learn in a week
[1:14:37] that's 20 things you learned in a month
[1:14:40] i looked at i said
[1:14:41] thank god for the wisdom and that's how
[1:14:43] i learned to work those computers but we
[1:14:45] came
[1:14:46] when we came when we get started out in
[1:14:49] the workforce it was nothing but paper
[1:14:51] huh so now you know why your young
[1:14:54] children y'all got it good
[1:14:55] hallelujah where's we had helped me lord
[1:14:57] he said now look
[1:14:59] the first thing look what the prophet of
[1:15:02] god is saying
[1:15:04] he's telling you about in this city of
[1:15:05] refuge
[1:15:07] now to get in this city of refuge
[1:15:11] when this man comes to christ this place
[1:15:14] of refuge
[1:15:15] when a man come in the old testament the
[1:15:18] first thing he had to come upon
[1:15:20] is his own free will
[1:15:25] remember he told the deacons not to
[1:15:26] bring billy paul up
[1:15:28] he said don't do that he said come into
[1:15:30] the office let me talk to you he said
[1:15:31] okay i understand y'all
[1:15:32] want billy paul to come in he said but
[1:15:34] don't ever do that again he said let
[1:15:35] billy paul come on his own
[1:15:38] let him come got to do it that's why
[1:15:40] we're telling you the gifts are good
[1:15:42] there's nothing wrong with the gifts
[1:15:43] when you have the gifts gifts operating
[1:15:45] but don't put the gift
[1:15:46] unless you have the giver unless the
[1:15:48] gift can be backed by the scriptures
[1:15:51] the gift got to be backed by the
[1:15:52] scriptures is that right because satan
[1:15:54] gives you something too
[1:15:55] people are being prosperous under these
[1:15:57] prosperous gospels out here is that
[1:15:59] right
[1:15:59] they're being prosperous that's why i
[1:16:01] said you got to understand the devil
[1:16:03] always come in and want to try
[1:16:04] things you know what i saw at that
[1:16:06] wedding you know what i saw at that
[1:16:08] wedding sister
[1:16:09] i saw at that wedding you know what i
[1:16:11] saw the hand of god
[1:16:15] i saw some of your family members your
[1:16:17] loved ones that you praying for
[1:16:20] that don't agree with this message
[1:16:23] but they when they came they recognized
[1:16:26] nobody could have set that up with god
[1:16:30] [Music]
[1:16:31] only god could have set that up
[1:16:35] so the enemy will always come in and try
[1:16:37] to pick and
[1:16:38] point at things but you got to keep your
[1:16:41] mind
[1:16:42] on what god is doing look at it through
[1:16:46] god's
[1:16:47] look at things through the mind of god
[1:16:50] so we have to understand that's why we
[1:16:52] were saying it and the prophet of god
[1:16:54] said
[1:16:54] people are going through things people
[1:16:57] are doing things but they don't want to
[1:16:59] do it
[1:17:00] if you go and conduct an order you can
[1:17:02] see some people wanting to get away from
[1:17:04] stubborn spirits is that right they
[1:17:06] don't want to be in that stubborn spirit
[1:17:09] remember saul all he said was god sent
[1:17:12] the what
[1:17:13] a evil spirit
[1:17:16] uh evil spirit on saul
[1:17:20] but now when you're going in the
[1:17:21] property god said but that spirit was
[1:17:24] stubbornness so he had religion
[1:17:28] and stubbornness when you battle in a
[1:17:30] religion in a stubborn spirit
[1:17:32] don't rebuke it just love it and pray
[1:17:36] for it
[1:17:37] and watch god do the work for you
[1:17:40] because you don't know what's really
[1:17:41] down in there
[1:17:42] that's another lesson let me get on
[1:17:44] these cities of refuge
[1:17:45] let me get on these cities of refugees
[1:17:47] before my wife get me home and tell me i
[1:17:48] didn't finish
[1:17:49] he said now look he said now look the
[1:17:52] first thing come to
[1:17:54] he said you have to come on a free more
[1:17:57] will
[1:17:58] got to be free more will he said and
[1:18:01] that's the way you have to come to
[1:18:03] christ
[1:18:04] he said another thing you must be
[1:18:06] satisfied
[1:18:08] are you satisfied ah they say you must
[1:18:12] be
[1:18:13] satisfied you're there you got to be
[1:18:16] grateful that you're here
[1:18:18] the grace of god that got you here
[1:18:21] he says now you don't especially some of
[1:18:24] you come from your native countries
[1:18:26] you come from your home country don't
[1:18:28] get caught up in america i'm homegrown
[1:18:30] born in america
[1:18:32] you can't even send me to africa you
[1:18:34] don't want me in africa i was growing
[1:18:35] here god put me here for a reason
[1:18:38] but let me tell you something god put
[1:18:39] you here too america is a spirit
[1:18:43] i can't go to africa and be in africa i
[1:18:46] can't go to japan to be a japanese
[1:18:48] i can't go to china to be a chinese but
[1:18:51] every last one of them could come to
[1:18:52] america and be american
[1:18:54] see americans of spirit you got to be
[1:18:57] careful you don't get caught up in the
[1:18:59] way is that right
[1:19:01] you'll be grateful that you're here and
[1:19:04] thank god for it
[1:19:05] and don't worry about getting caught up
[1:19:07] in their ways is that right
[1:19:09] rapping and all that foolishness
[1:19:10] everybody got a rap is that right
[1:19:12] we had rap too we got rap too
[1:19:16] back in our day then ain't nothing new
[1:19:18] up under the sun
[1:19:20] what does it say brother billy billy
[1:19:22] billy fulfilling banana phantom
[1:19:23] fulfilling means
[1:19:25] fulfilling their leg it's nothing new
[1:19:28] under the sun don't worry about it
[1:19:30] brother trying to
[1:19:31] interpret that don't worry about it i'm
[1:19:34] just saying that he said no luck
[1:19:38] he said look he said he said now look
[1:19:41] they put him out you must willfully
[1:19:44] you it says now you can't hang around
[1:19:48] and you and he said listen to this
[1:19:50] another thing you must be satisfied
[1:19:52] while you're there
[1:19:53] you can't you can't hang around
[1:19:57] every day trying
[1:20:00] no marrying no player we're gonna get to
[1:20:03] these cities
[1:20:04] but i'm laying this out for you so you
[1:20:06] we can nail it with the scriptures
[1:20:08] he said now when you come to christ
[1:20:11] you can't look back to the world the
[1:20:14] bible said he
[1:20:15] he that puts his hands on the plow and
[1:20:16] turns to look back
[1:20:18] is not worthy of plowing now there
[1:20:21] is where so many so-called christians
[1:20:24] make their mistake
[1:20:26] see they act like they're going to plow
[1:20:29] but the first thing
[1:20:30] comes along they blow up about it
[1:20:33] now look and the other thing he says
[1:20:37] there's no complaining if you
[1:20:40] complain you are outside you are put
[1:20:43] outside the city of refuge
[1:20:47] if you start complaining see the grace
[1:20:49] you're getting here
[1:20:55] these cities the refuge okay this
[1:20:59] tatus mount nephilia
[1:21:03] it means it means sacred place
[1:21:06] when you make it to the city of refuge
[1:21:08] you're trying to get to a safe place
[1:21:11] because somebody's killing you
[1:21:13] somebody's after you
[1:21:15] so we're talking about this here it's a
[1:21:17] sacred place
[1:21:19] a sanctuary see it's holy our refuge is
[1:21:23] jesus christ
[1:21:25] that's cadis shekham at mount ephraim
[1:21:29] it's the shoulder jesus said and over he
[1:21:33] told us in isaiah 9
[1:21:34] he shall be the counselor the prince of
[1:21:37] peace
[1:21:38] lord of the lord he shall be the
[1:21:40] government he should carry the what
[1:21:42] the government upon his shoulders huh
[1:21:46] that's shechem we're talking about
[1:21:49] hebrew
[1:21:49] hebron is in judah now these were the
[1:21:53] cities of refuge on the west side of
[1:21:56] jordan remember there was vote for
[1:21:58] jordan you had to die out to yourself
[1:22:00] you can't come in your own way of
[1:22:02] thinking
[1:22:03] you're trying to get to this city of
[1:22:05] refuge
[1:22:06] that's why he says in christ there is no
[1:22:09] condemnation
[1:22:12] we walk not out to the flesh but after
[1:22:14] the spirit
[1:22:15] hebrew hebrew mean what fellowship
[1:22:19] is fellowship is called to fellowship
[1:22:21] with christ
[1:22:22] to have fellowship but then the prophet
[1:22:25] that god said
[1:22:26] he sent the holy ghost why so we could
[1:22:28] be in power in prayer
[1:22:30] so we can have fellowship with god so we
[1:22:33] can become
[1:22:34] one with god so we can finish the plan
[1:22:37] of
[1:22:38] redemption is that right so we don't
[1:22:40] know where that last soul is
[1:22:43] hallelujah uh give me five minutes you
[1:22:46] don't mind
[1:22:47] hallelujah he say look now the city's
[1:22:51] the refuge
[1:22:52] he says down hebron in judah was that
[1:22:55] fellowship with jesus christ
[1:22:57] on the east side of jordan it was
[1:23:00] bizarre
[1:23:02] it was in the plain of moab it meant
[1:23:06] fortification fortified
[1:23:09] jesus is the stronghold to all those
[1:23:12] that trust him
[1:23:14] he deserved defense city
[1:23:17] being fortified and then when you got up
[1:23:20] in this city
[1:23:21] he says now what rayman gilead
[1:23:24] it's in the tribe of god it was uh it
[1:23:28] meant
[1:23:28] exalt it means high up we shall exalt
[1:23:32] him
[1:23:33] if i if i if i be lifted up from the
[1:23:36] earth
[1:23:37] then i'll draw all men unto me is that
[1:23:39] right
[1:23:40] hallelujah he says look god has exhorted
[1:23:44] our lord
[1:23:45] with a mighty hand it says now then go
[1:23:48] line goal line it says there was also
[1:23:52] now these remember
[1:23:54] these were leviticus cities the levites
[1:23:57] and so these were priests and once you
[1:24:00] got in there in that priest
[1:24:02] you had a boundary you was a prisoner
[1:24:05] but you was a prisoner at large
[1:24:07] you was in a place where you can still
[1:24:10] be there
[1:24:10] and recuperate you can come to a place
[1:24:14] where god can you can be restored again
[1:24:18] you can be your joy of the lord can be
[1:24:20] restored
[1:24:21] god has brought you in a place where you
[1:24:23] can exalt him up on high
[1:24:26] you don't have to be ashamed of them he
[1:24:29] has given
[1:24:30] us an unadulterated word he has
[1:24:33] broken the seals for each and every one
[1:24:36] of us
[1:24:36] and saved the best for last is that
[1:24:39] right
[1:24:40] he have combated every teaching in every
[1:24:43] age
[1:24:43] he has brought a teaching in the truth
[1:24:46] is that right
[1:24:47] so now through all the prayer
[1:24:50] through the uh of gifts through his
[1:24:52] signs
[1:24:53] through his wonders but now he's
[1:24:55] unfolding his mysteries to you
[1:24:58] now by him unfolding these things we're
[1:25:00] going to confound the work of the devil
[1:25:03] so it's going to get to the point and
[1:25:06] god is going to use you in a mighty way
[1:25:09] but he has to get all this foolishness
[1:25:11] when there's a revival
[1:25:13] where does the revival of the trash come
[1:25:15] up to the top is that right
[1:25:17] yeah the trash got to get out of here he
[1:25:20] told zerubbabel
[1:25:22] he told joshua don't finish don't put
[1:25:25] your spirit back
[1:25:26] up until you're finished getting all the
[1:25:28] foolishness out of here
[1:25:30] so it's best to just come on and repent
[1:25:33] and if you're struggling with something
[1:25:35] just buying that demon up every day
[1:25:38] until god come and deliver you
[1:25:40] hallelujah let me look at this one here

[1:25:51] tribe of bonashes
