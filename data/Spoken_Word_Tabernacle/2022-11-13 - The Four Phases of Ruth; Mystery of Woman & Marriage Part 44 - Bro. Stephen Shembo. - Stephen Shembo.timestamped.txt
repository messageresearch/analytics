[20:06] when uh these songs were um coming to me
[20:09] that they repeat themselves a little bit
[20:11] with redeeming blood and
[20:14] songs on our heart and
[20:16] it's just the goodness of God just how
[20:18] he uh I love it when he places the song

[21:05] you did good listen once you hit 30 you
[21:08] won't forget how many it is okay
[21:11] they just
[21:16] I mean 30 years not 60 years together
[21:18] you ain't been together 60 years
[21:21] over 60 I get that part
[21:24] I wanted to share something with y'all
[21:26] uh it's kind of a praise report and then
[21:28] I'm gonna go into these um
[21:30] to these prayer prayer requests while we
[21:33] were down there in Georgia I had I had
[21:35] you know we've been hearing a little bit
[21:36] about numerology and all and I thought
[21:37] I'd share this with y'all because to me
[21:39] it has a significance to it
[21:42] um uh on July 1st is when we moved
[21:45] that's seven and one seven being a
[21:48] number of completion one being God so
[21:51] on September 17th which is another one
[21:54] and a seven is when Chris and Rebecca
[21:56] got married amen you hear that
[21:59] a little feedback so seven weeks and one
[22:03] day later
[22:04] Lily gets married
[22:07] okay
[22:08] another seven and one
[22:10] and then
[22:12] she gets married on 11
[22:14] 6 which if you add them together that's
[22:17] also 17.
[22:19] so I down there now there's a fifth one
[22:22] coming up here in just a minute but I
[22:24] started thinking Lord why
[22:26] three Perfection why didn't you stop at
[22:28] three
[22:29] you gave me four numbers with one and
[22:31] seven in it and that's deliverance and I
[22:33] thought Hallelujah empty nester I'm
[22:36] delivered
[22:39] so pray to God
[22:42] so Brother Scott Batman got in touch
[22:45] with me this week wanted to wish me a
[22:47] happy Veterans Day
[22:50] Brother Sam any anybody else before we

[47:07] doing everything he can
[47:09] to distract the young people
[47:12] amen don't put yourself into more
[47:16] responsibility that you have yet
[47:20] do you understand what I'm saying in
[47:22] other words don't get into college and
[47:24] begin to be part of this club and this
[47:27] club and this club and this club before
[47:29] you know it you have a lot of
[47:31] responsibility and you won't be able to
[47:33] make it to church
[47:35] that's why I was in university and I
[47:38] could be a deacon because I shine away
[47:40] from every group all the Alpha Kappa fed
[47:43] or whatever you call it I didn't get
[47:45] into it amen and the Lord helped me to
[47:48] finish one year ahead of everybody
[47:53] everybody okay so don't engage yourself
[47:56] into a lot of stuff
[47:58] I appreciate helping the people
[48:01] I appreciate helping the mother
[48:03] but young people don't put yourself into
[48:06] responsibility of children
[48:09] that will keep you outside of the church
[48:12] in other words you engage yourself
[48:14] picking up a baby or something and
[48:16] because of the baby you're not sitting
[48:17] in the sanctuary
[48:19] um
[48:21] you have a different Pastor Dave I'm not
[48:24] going to play games
[48:26] amen
[48:28] you can do it you can help but be
[48:31] careful the devil will give you that
[48:33] responsibility
[48:34] I'm not saying God you yourself with the
[48:37] Devil
[48:38] find yourself into that responsibility
[48:40] and you will be outside the church
[48:43] in the pretense of taking care of a
[48:46] child
[48:48] and you will be missing the whole
[48:49] service
[48:50] when that is not your primary
[48:52] responsibility
[48:55] stay in the sanctuary yes
[48:57] did you hear me all of them are not here
[49:00] hopefully they will listen to what I'm
[49:02] saying don't sit in the back they come
[49:05] to the front
[49:09] you don't say Amen Brother David can you
[49:11] give me some bullets so I don't have to
[49:14] worry about them
[49:15] just give me more money amen the young
[49:18] people don't sit on the back there
[49:23] brother Kelly you got that right brother
[49:26] Robert you got it right so if brother
[49:28] Kelly sends you to the front don't get
[49:30] mad don't sit on the battery
[49:33] okay
[49:34] you are free now do the best that you
[49:37] can and soak as much worried as you can
[49:41] before you have five or six children and
[49:45] you don't have time to even read your
[49:46] Bible
[49:54] it is not me it is the Drone that I
[49:58] dispatched
[50:00] and they are just pulling information
[50:01] and I get information from them and once
[50:04] I get information everything is zeroed
[50:07] in then I struck straight because I know
[50:09] what I'm shooting for amen so young
[50:12] people don't put yourself into a lot of
[50:14] responsibilities
[50:16] when you come to church focus on the
[50:18] word
[50:22] leave the babies alone
[50:24] wait after church go get the babies
[50:27] wait when we have Fellowship go get the
[50:29] babies but don't put yourself busy
[50:33] in pretense to run away from the service
[50:38] see how you can get ambushed
[50:41] because this Holy Ghost is not playing
[50:44] games
[50:49] you will love me one day
[50:51] I can't let's say about people fussing
[50:53] at me or showing faces it doesn't change
[50:56] me
[50:57] I will continue to preach because I know
[50:59] where I'm standing
[51:06] everybody okay
[51:09] we thank you all for your prayer for my
[51:11] grandmother she went on to be with the
[51:13] Lord my mom is here this morning that is
[51:16] the correct way to celebrate instead of
[51:18] staying home she wanted she she's part
[51:20] of us here this morning so you continue
[51:23] to pray you know it's willing tomorrow
[51:24] she will travel going into the country
[51:27] everything is well she passed away a 94
[51:30] years old
[51:32] so there is two ways you can look at
[51:34] it's a separation it hurt
[51:36] but either you can be ungrateful
[51:39] or you can thank God for 94 years old
[51:43] which is more than 80 and for the major
[51:46] thing that she has accomplished that's
[51:49] what we want to thank God Amen

[56:48] [Applause]
[56:50] it is the picture of who
[56:55] you know when we talk about this picture
[56:59] we took the prophecy of Paul where Paul
[57:03] said to you who are trouble
[57:05] you rest with us
[57:07] when the Lord Jesus shall be watered
[57:12] for your microphone
[57:15] I can tell
[57:19] praise God who took the microphone away
[57:22] from him
[57:27] amen the Bible said to you who are
[57:30] trouble rest with us when the Lord Jesus
[57:34] shall be what revealed reveal from
[57:36] heaven with water Mighty Angels it is
[57:40] not the coming of the Lord
[57:45] amen it is the revealing
[57:49] of the Lord in heaven
[57:52] why in heaven
[57:56] everybody okay
[57:59] brother Branham said we found that Jesus
[58:02] was fixing to do something great
[58:06] on a great occasion was fixing and on a
[58:10] great occasion was fixing to happen
[58:13] and when God gets ready to do things
[58:17] great
[58:20] everybody okay the first thing God
[58:23] usually does
[58:26] is making known in the water Heavens in
[58:30] the heaven water above first brother his
[58:32] microphone is not on
[58:36] I need to preach with him
[58:38] amen he said he make a known in the
[58:41] heavens above first
[58:44] he always declare his work in the water
[58:47] Heaven before he does it on the water
[58:50] Earth
[58:51] that day they took picture all across
[58:55] Southern United States and Mexico there
[58:59] he hangs now in the Life Magazine still
[59:02] a water mystery to them but he declared
[59:06] in the heaven
[59:07] before he does it on the water Earth he
[59:11] always does that she shows his son in
[59:15] the heaven first so God before he opened
[59:19] the seals
[59:22] everybody okay on the Earth
[59:25] he has to declare the seventh seal on
[59:28] the heaven first
[59:33] everybody okay
[59:34] the Bible says that he did it in flaming
[59:38] fire
[59:39] taking Vengeance on them that know not
[59:42] God and that obey not the gospel of our
[59:46] Lord Jesus Christ if you look at that
[59:48] word flaming fire the angels will come
[59:52] in a flaming fire
[59:57] in Hebrew one this is your boss who gave
[59:59] me this the Bible say and of the Angels
[1:00:03] say he who maketh his Angel Waters Kama
[1:00:08] and his Minister water flame of fire

[1:00:18] in flaming fire
[1:00:25] your boss is telling me something and I
[1:00:28] need to talk to you
[1:00:30] the pillar of Fire
[1:00:33] when he was sin by day how was it
[1:00:38] by day
[1:00:40] the pillar of fire appear as a water
[1:00:42] cloud
[1:00:44] and by night it appear as water
[1:00:47] now when they took this picture was that
[1:00:51] in daytime or night time
[1:00:55] so if it's on daytime you need to appear
[1:00:57] as a water Cloud
[1:01:01] [Applause]
[1:01:04] your boss just gave it to me right now
[1:01:07] everybody okay so if future trouble that
[1:01:10] the Bible say a flaming of fire a
[1:01:13] flaming of fire is the appearing of
[1:01:15] night
[1:01:16] because it's allowed this year it is
[1:01:19] darkest of everything but the picture
[1:01:22] has to be taken on the day so the pillar
[1:01:25] of fire in the day will appear as a
[1:01:28] cloud
[1:01:32] [Applause]
[1:01:34] I hope it's stabilizing somebody
[1:01:37] everybody okay brother Branham say in
[1:01:40] his hand he held Seven Stars
[1:01:44] and you shall see in a few minutes I
[1:01:46] want to get to it let the Bible just

[1:01:51] Mysteries where did Brother Branham get
[1:01:53] the word ministers
[1:01:56] because the angels are spirit and they
[1:01:59] are water
[1:02:00] and they appear as water flame of fire
[1:02:03] he says seven ministers one minister to
[1:02:06] each age

[1:02:37] come when he set the water why this
[1:02:41] brother but I'm calling this light
[1:02:43] because it is by the day he said why did
[1:02:47] he set that light up there in the water
[1:02:52] not the coming
[1:02:59] everybody okay that light is in the
[1:03:03] Revelation nothing is coming Amen in the
[1:03:06] revelation of it to it it shows his show
[1:03:10] to the world when he sent the water
[1:03:12] seven angels to do water the water
[1:03:16] that had been done through there and
[1:03:19] showed the water

[1:06:22] [Music]
[1:06:24] he said his head and his hair were white
[1:06:28] like water as white as what snow and his
[1:06:31] eyes were as water flame of fire

[1:13:04] you to the Bible
[1:13:07] seeing a pillar of fire is in you
[1:13:11] Act
[1:13:12] is it new to you no Moses had the pillar
[1:13:15] of Fire
[1:13:16] Daniel had the pillar of fire Paul had
[1:13:18] the feeling of fire is that new why are
[1:13:21] you scared
[1:13:23] [Applause]

[1:13:29] run away from the pillar of fire to
[1:13:31] please your friend

[1:22:52] make something different
[1:22:53] [Music]
[1:22:57] we got the first conscience and the
[1:23:00] second conscience or the subconscious we
[1:23:02] already went through this the first
[1:23:04] conscience is when you awake just like
[1:23:06] you awake right now but when you go to

[1:23:13] the man that is looking at your dream
[1:23:18] that is where your soul is working

[1:33:20] stuff that I cannot play game with it
[1:33:30] and I know what the devil is doing yes
[1:33:40] when I was single I never want to sit in
[1:33:43] the back
[1:33:45] I was always on the front the one who
[1:33:48] took me away from the front is when I
[1:33:49] got married
[1:33:54] then I moved back to begin to sit with
[1:33:56] my wife on the behind
[1:33:58] so I don't know what's wrong with a
[1:34:00] young man if you're not in a technical
[1:34:02] stuff or you're not working in a camera
[1:34:05] what are you doing in the back
[1:34:13] we will come in church getting the
[1:34:16] church sit down
[1:34:17] we won't move even to the bathroom until
[1:34:20] the church is done

[1:34:25] what did you eat and you eat that every
[1:34:28] Sunday amen
[1:34:30] five times
[1:34:33] glory to God stop those kind of stuff
[1:34:35] you're going to regret one time
[1:34:40] anything you can over there over there
[1:34:42] trying to talk trying to do something
[1:34:44] you're wasting your time and then before
[1:34:46] you know it I'm receiving the question
[1:34:47] and I look I say I already covered this
[1:34:49] one I already covered this one where
[1:34:51] were you when I was preaching it
[1:34:56] this is not a church
[1:34:59] anity around the message where we come
[1:35:02] in fellowship and we can't wait quickly
[1:35:04] to be outside and to be talking
[1:35:06] everybody that was sleeping is wide
[1:35:08] awake on the parking lot
[1:35:10] that's not what we're here for
[1:35:14] sure you can do that at home
[1:35:22] I will have bushy on Wednesday
[1:35:26] because some run on Sunday and then they
[1:35:29] will come on Wednesday
[1:35:34] because they know our brother Stevens
[1:35:40] you don't know what I'm doing
[1:35:42] let's go to Genesis chapter 5.
[1:35:51] I will never play game and I'll tell you
[1:35:54] the truth
[1:35:55] I don't want your blood in my head
[1:35:58] you hit me fine
[1:36:00] [Applause]
[1:36:04] I will still pray for you Genesis 5
[1:36:07] verse 1.
[1:36:09] this is the book of the generation of
[1:36:12] who Adam in the day that God created man
[1:36:15] in his water likeness of God made he him
[1:36:19] men he didn't make a woman
[1:36:23] I want you to get this
[1:36:25] correctly man and male and female you
[1:36:30] know that verse two you might be seated
[1:36:33] this man is male
[1:36:35] and he's female
[1:36:38] God help us
[1:36:40] created he death
[1:36:42] and God did what
[1:36:46] you okay
[1:36:48] God blessed them
[1:36:51] the blessing that God gives was not only
[1:36:55] to the man
[1:37:01] do you understand what I'm saying
[1:37:03] that's why you hear sisters in the
[1:37:06] message they don't want to read the
[1:37:07] message
[1:37:08] they think the message is for men
[1:37:15] everybody okay
[1:37:16] God didn't bless him
[1:37:19] the Bible said God bless them
[1:37:23] so the blessing is for everybody
[1:37:26] [Applause]
[1:37:30] what can the blessing was that
[1:37:34] what did God bless them with
[1:37:39] and that blessing was equal amen what
[1:37:42] kind of blessing was that in other words
[1:37:44] at this stage is can do everything that
[1:37:49] Adam can do
[1:37:51] yeah I'm breaking your theology
[1:37:54] everybody okay he said male and female
[1:37:57] created he them and he did water
[1:38:01] bless them and did what you call their
[1:38:03] name and call them water so not only did
[1:38:08] he bless them he gave both of them one
[1:38:11] name
[1:38:15] amen so the name of this man is Adam and
[1:38:20] the name of this woman is Adam
[1:38:28] you will understand now from today on
[1:38:32] why how do we have this message amen
[1:38:36] we already started last week Amen in the
[1:38:40] day when they were what created let's go
[1:38:43] to roof chapter 3.
[1:38:49] glory to God
[1:38:56] if you dare you can say Amen
[1:39:04] yes verse 3 uh verse one then Naomi her
[1:39:09] mother-in-law said to her my daughter
[1:39:11] shall I not seek rest for you
[1:39:14] that he may be well with you and now
[1:39:17] he's not boas of our kindred with whose
[1:39:21] Maiden you wear it's now a past
[1:39:25] she's no longer with the lady she was
[1:39:28] with the medicine amen
[1:39:30] behold he Boaz not the reaper we know
[1:39:35] it's barley tonight
[1:39:38] in the threshing floor the one who's
[1:39:40] working tonight is not the maiden it is
[1:39:43] not roof it is not the reaper it is Boaz
[1:39:46] alone
[1:39:48] and roof have to go alone
[1:39:52] to meet Boaz alone
[1:39:58] no more a public show
[1:40:02] everybody okay jump to verse 8.
[1:40:05] the Bible says and he came to pass at
[1:40:08] what time midnight you understand this
[1:40:10] now that the man was afraid and turned
[1:40:13] himself and behold a woman lay at his
[1:40:16] feet
[1:40:17] and he said who are you and she answered
[1:40:20] I am Rufio what
[1:40:23] he's calling herself a handmaid
[1:40:25] pray Therefore your skirt over your
[1:40:28] handmade for you are a near water
[1:40:31] verse 10 and he said Blessed Be You of
[1:40:35] the Lord my daughter this one is saying
[1:40:38] boss this one is saying God but the boss
[1:40:41] and the door they are gonna change
[1:40:45] everybody okay

[1:40:50] this ladder end than at the beginning
[1:40:53] in as much as you follow not water
[1:40:58] whether poor or water so the kindness
[1:41:02] here Boaz is speaking is not about
[1:41:05] bringing food to Naomi
[1:41:09] the kindness here is a bad roof not
[1:41:13] being attracted to the other young boys
[1:41:17] in other words there was still a
[1:41:20] protection
[1:41:21] for roof to fall
[1:41:28] are you understanding amen boys was
[1:41:32] still concerned about roof being
[1:41:35] deceived by a young man
[1:41:39] so proof under the repair roof in the
[1:41:45] field of Boaz under the reaper which are
[1:41:48] the Angels roof under the angel was
[1:41:52] still susceptible to fall
[1:41:57] yes amen even though boy has already
[1:42:01] blocked her there but boys were still
[1:42:03] afraid of one thing
[1:42:05] is she gonna be interested to the young
[1:42:07] man
[1:42:11] let's go to Ephesian five
[1:42:15] and then we fly quickly
[1:42:19] if you dare you can say Amen
[1:42:21] Ephesians 5 23.

[1:43:13] that's it
[1:43:15] when it comes to marriage he say wife
[1:43:18] submit yourself that's all why
[1:43:22] amen
[1:43:24] for the wife
[1:43:27] God is asking one thing
[1:43:30] to be submissive
[1:43:34] why

[1:44:08] woman to be subnative to me no
[1:44:10] no to the husband
[1:44:12] it's one man
[1:44:18] submitting to one husband
[1:44:23] your own husband
[1:44:25] so you don't go tell somebody else's
[1:44:27] wife what to do
[1:44:30] everybody okay
[1:44:32] us to the water
[1:44:35] when you submitting yourself to the
[1:44:37] house
[1:44:38] to the husband you do it
[1:44:41] like you are doing it to the Lord
[1:44:45] why
[1:44:49] because the man that you are hooked with
[1:44:52] have imperfection
[1:44:57] do you follow me you are doing that not
[1:45:01] because of him
[1:45:03] you need to do that in your backpack you

[1:45:08] why do you have to do that
[1:45:12] God give me time
[1:45:15] to help you up
[1:45:17] you do it as unto the water
[1:45:22] amen
[1:45:24] if you doing something to the Lord you
[1:45:27] know how you're doing it
[1:45:28] there is a different way if you're doing
[1:45:30] something to please me or if you're
[1:45:32] doing something to please the Lord
[1:45:35] if you're doing it to please the lord
[1:45:37] it's another level
[1:45:41] it's another love
[1:45:43] foreign
[1:45:45] [Music]
[1:45:56] [Music]
[1:46:01] because that's where the marriage cannot
[1:46:04] broken cannot break
[1:46:07] I'm gonna help you out
[1:46:08] [Music]
[1:46:10] amen
[1:46:13] Lord help me
[1:46:15] verse 23 for the husband is the water
[1:46:21] the head of the wife does he have volume
[1:46:24] or we need to change microphone
[1:46:32] you can turn that one off
[1:46:35] here brother
[1:46:37] thank you see
[1:46:39] for the husband is the head of the wife
[1:46:44] even as Christ is the head of the water
[1:46:47] now Paul is moving with two
[1:46:52] at the beginning it was not your husband
[1:46:55] a natural wife now he's taking two
[1:46:57] couples a natural couple and a spiritual
[1:47:00] couple and not your couple you have
[1:47:03] husband
[1:47:05] and wife
[1:47:07] and a spiritual couple you have who
[1:47:11] Christ
[1:47:12] and he's what church and the church that
[1:47:15] sounds better
[1:47:17] that's it amen he says and he is the
[1:47:21] savior of the body so this church Paul
[1:47:26] is calling that the body
[1:47:29] because Christ Paul call him what
[1:47:35] the head
[1:47:37] amen so if Christ is not in your life
[1:47:43] you don't have the head yet
[1:47:47] let's continue
[1:47:48] verse 24 therefore as the church is
[1:47:53] water subject if you notice the church
[1:47:56] is under submission
[1:48:00] do you follow me yes oh God
[1:48:04] the church also God is asking the church
[1:48:07] to be submissive
[1:48:14] I hope I can struck that demon today
[1:48:17] amen
[1:48:18] therefore as the church is subject to
[1:48:21] who Christ not to another body
[1:48:25] not to another person
[1:48:27] you gotta know who Christ is
[1:48:30] [Applause]
[1:48:32] everybody okay
[1:48:34] so let their wife be to the water
[1:48:37] husbands that's not what the scripture
[1:48:40] says to the water
[1:48:46] don't try to please somebody else's
[1:48:48] husband
[1:48:50] your own husband
[1:48:55] why your own
[1:48:58] so let's continue
[1:49:00] your own husband in water everything
[1:49:05] [Music]
[1:49:06] we will continue
[1:49:09] now to your husband
[1:49:12] verse 25 husband
[1:49:14] love thy wife you see God saying husband
[1:49:18] submit yourself no why to the husband
[1:49:20] God say lost
[1:49:24] to the husband
[1:49:28] to the husband
[1:49:30] God is asking love
[1:49:34] that's it
[1:49:35] why
[1:49:37] what is going on in the husband that he
[1:49:41] must love the wife
[1:49:43] and what is going on in the husband that
[1:49:46] she must submit herself to the husband
[1:49:47] what does love your wife means
[1:49:50] what does submit yourself me
[1:49:55] all right husband love your wife even
[1:49:59] ask how Christ love is water the church
[1:50:03] and gave himself for water for it so a
[1:50:07] husband must give himself
[1:50:09] for his wife
[1:50:16] in other words daddy must go to work
[1:50:23] you don't understand me
[1:50:27] that's why Paul said a man who does not
[1:50:30] provide for his family is worse than an
[1:50:33] evident
[1:50:37] because now we begin to share
[1:50:41] amen
[1:50:43] and sometimes 75 percent of the Lord he
[1:50:47] said the woman
[1:50:48] and the man is only 25 and he's fine
[1:50:53] it's a
[1:50:56] [Applause]
[1:51:03] well don't worry
[1:51:04] I'm fine
[1:51:06] everybody okay verse 26 that he must
[1:51:10] sanctify and cleanse it with the word
[1:51:13] worship of the Water by the water that
[1:51:17] he crossed my presented to himself so
[1:51:20] he's the one working to present it to
[1:51:23] himself a water glorious Church helping
[1:51:26] water no not having spot not spot or
[1:51:30] water wrinkles or any such thing but
[1:51:32] that it should be holy and without what
[1:51:35] without bleming so the bride must be
[1:51:38] holy
[1:51:40] God holy and the bride must be without
[1:51:44] blemish
[1:51:48] you gonna see what
[1:51:51] see what amen verse 28 so ought to out
[1:51:54] men to love their wives as their own
[1:51:57] water bodies he that loveth his life
[1:52:00] love is what himself for no man ever
[1:52:04] hated his own flesh but he does what
[1:52:06] nourishes so you gotta feed your wife
[1:52:08] and daughter so you gotta care for your
[1:52:12] wife even as the Lord to the church for
[1:52:16] we are members of his what body of his
[1:52:21] what of his what bow watch Paul what is
[1:52:24] saying Paul is saying that we are we
[1:52:28] us
[1:52:30] we are what members
[1:52:32] we are members members of what nobody in
[1:52:37] his body
[1:52:39] and he's using what kind of word for the
[1:52:41] body flesh flesh and Water World
[1:52:47] so Flesh and Bones means
[1:52:54] the definition
[1:52:55] amen
[1:52:57] for this cause Shaman shall a man leave
[1:53:01] his father and mother and shall be
[1:53:04] joined to his wife
[1:53:06] and the two shall be watered one flesh
[1:53:09] so when the woman is coming
[1:53:12] she's bringing submission
[1:53:14] when man is coming man is bringing love
[1:53:17] if you get those two equations together
[1:53:20] you are hooked
[1:53:26] come on
[1:53:27] jump to verse uh 32 this is
[1:53:32] a great what mystery but I speak
[1:53:35] concerning who Christ and the water the
[1:53:38] church so this thing that Paul is
[1:53:40] explaining here that white submission
[1:53:43] and husband love and then cherish all of
[1:53:47] that Paul say it's a great mystery
[1:53:51] you who don't love mystery
[1:53:53] what is going on in that mission what is
[1:53:56] great about that mystery
[1:53:59] let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are
[1:54:02] approaching you humbly this morning
[1:54:04] Father thanking you once again for your
[1:54:06] grace your love your mercy and for
[1:54:08] everything you have been doing for us
[1:54:10] father I have done what acts like what I
[1:54:13] can do
[1:54:14] as a human being that you have given
[1:54:16] ability but now when it comes to
[1:54:18] interpret your word it takes only the
[1:54:21] supernatural power of the Holy Spirit
[1:54:23] Lord may you move me completely out of
[1:54:26] the way may you come and speak to your
[1:54:28] children be the Alpha and the Omega of
[1:54:30] this service in Jesus precious name amen
[1:54:33] amen my subject this morning is the four
[1:54:37] phases of Ruth
[1:54:39] the mystery of women
[1:54:41] and marriage we already talked about the
[1:54:44] mystery of men today it is the mystery
[1:54:48] of a woman
[1:54:52] the mystery of a woman
[1:54:55] with marriage
[1:54:59] we are in the trashing floor
[1:55:02] and we are also dealing with the second
[1:55:04] all in our Tabernacle reading we are in
[1:55:07] the holiest
[1:55:09] and this is where we were we found out
[1:55:12] that roof
[1:55:13] moved completely from the Reaper or the
[1:55:17] angel all the way to the trashing floor
[1:55:20] where Boaz was the only one working
[1:55:25] everybody okay and I'm gonna quickly
[1:55:28] remind you that under the return
[1:55:31] everybody that was working over there in
[1:55:34] that picture were women
[1:55:36] so it was rough
[1:55:38] with the maiden
[1:55:40] that were all working
[1:55:43] and this is the work of a female
[1:55:47] all the work of the women
[1:55:51] or the working of the female or the
[1:55:55] women's spirit
[1:55:58] everybody okay but when you come to the
[1:56:02] tragic floor the maiden are no longer
[1:56:05] there
[1:56:05] in the trenching floor it's about roof
[1:56:08] and Boaz
[1:56:09] but at this time even though roof
[1:56:12] carried the female spirit
[1:56:16] spirit
[1:56:22] everybody okay but they're working now
[1:56:25] was a working of a man
[1:56:28] it was a male that was working
[1:56:31] but it was no longer a woman working the
[1:56:34] woman was resting but the man Spirit was
[1:56:38] the one working
[1:56:39] so there is a time where a woman work
[1:56:46] are you following me and there was a
[1:56:48] damn that it's not the female Spirit
[1:56:51] working it is now the Mad spirit that
[1:56:54] are doing that is doing the work
[1:56:57] amen everybody okay so far in the
[1:57:00] parable of the of the Dead version we
[1:57:03] found out that when the Midnight Cry
[1:57:05] came
[1:57:07] all the Virgin arrows
[1:57:10] amen and there after the Midnight Cry
[1:57:13] that's when the second oil was opened
[1:57:17] everybody okay the second one made the
[1:57:22] other foolish virgin
[1:57:24] realize what they did not have
[1:57:29] everybody okay are you following me the
[1:57:33] second all Not only was there a no did
[1:57:36] that bring you to the bathroom after the
[1:57:39] midnight to the second Journey for you
[1:57:41] to go further in the ministry but it is
[1:57:44] annoying that make the foolish woman
[1:57:47] relax their emptiness
[1:57:53] everybody okay and when they Relax The
[1:57:57] Emptiness they themselves went out hmm
[1:58:06] the Bible said in verse 10 that why they
[1:58:10] went to the water so nobody chased them
[1:58:14] away
[1:58:15] [Music]
[1:58:18] everybody okay the lack of the second
[1:58:21] oil made them go out
[1:58:25] [Applause]
[1:58:27] everybody okay they left on their own
[1:58:31] and they left with their intention
[1:58:35] to find the second oil somewhere else
[1:58:42] everybody okay and what they found out
[1:58:46] was the oil of tribulation
[1:58:49] [Music]
[1:58:52] because when they came back they knocked
[1:58:55] at the door they say Lord Lord open to
[1:58:58] us the Lord said I cannot open and they
[1:59:01] were left outside where they were
[1:59:03] gnashing of teeth and they were wearing
[1:59:06] in other words they received an
[1:59:08] anointing for the tribulation period
[1:59:12] everybody okay so you will see people
[1:59:15] leaving the message
[1:59:18] trying to find something that they are
[1:59:22] longing for outside the message and what
[1:59:25] else shall be they gonna find out if
[1:59:28] they are getting under the anointing of
[1:59:30] the tribulation
[1:59:39] says this he said they were back in the
[1:59:43] churches
[1:59:44] there was some of them in there there
[1:59:48] was good people but there was not in the
[1:59:51] Star Wars right they were not under the
[1:59:54] light of the star of the edge
[1:59:58] [Music]
[2:00:00] amen that's why you need to know what
[2:00:02] token are you giving to the people
[2:00:05] everybody okay brother Branham said what
[2:00:08] I mean with the weak deep into the water
[2:00:12] so there was some connection that was
[2:00:15] cut off
[2:00:16] the week was no longer in the oil which
[2:00:19] oil
[2:00:21] brother Branham says see he was out he
[2:00:24] was walking gone out and they had done
[2:00:26] water separated themselves Paul said in
[2:00:29] his day they separate themselves from us
[2:00:32] seemingly not having the what face
[2:00:38] and went away from them they went out
[2:00:41] from us because there was not of what us
[2:00:45] now it started back in the early
[2:00:48] efficient age and comes on down into
[2:00:51] this Edge today something every one of
[2:00:54] those age what happened in them lap over
[2:00:57] into this water
[2:00:59] now notice that this virgin though she
[2:01:02] went into where there was what sleeping
[2:01:05] and wearing and water gushing of teeth
[2:01:07] everybody okay so far open with me in uh
[2:01:11] first John chapter 2.
[2:01:14] his microphone is not active
[2:01:21] first John chapter 2.
[2:01:23] if you dare you can say Amen
[2:01:26] verse 18. let's look at that scripture
[2:01:30] if you dare you can say Amen
[2:01:33] thank you Sterling first John chapter 2
[2:01:35] verse 18. if you dare you can say Amen
[2:01:38] we are good on time
[2:01:41] just when you get some good stuff
[2:01:45] barely fill up quickly
[2:01:49] you there
[2:01:55] you're getting the rolls quickly
[2:01:59] little children it is the last time and
[2:02:03] as you have heard that Antichrist shall
[2:02:06] come
[2:02:07] and even water yeah you okay brother you
[2:02:11] got it even water now are there many
[2:02:15] antichrists
[2:02:16] whereby we know that it is the what
[2:02:19] remember this is John right watch
[2:02:22] careful
[2:02:23] then went out
[2:02:26] from us
[2:02:28] but they were not of us so somebody have
[2:02:32] to separate
[2:02:35] everybody okay and when they're
[2:02:37] separating there is a meaning spiritual
[2:02:41] for if uh the Bible say for if they had
[2:02:46] been of us
[2:02:47] they would not have to have water
[2:02:50] continue with water
[2:02:52] so to show that you're really part of it
[2:02:55] you need to continue all the way if at
[2:02:58] the middle of the road you jump off it
[2:03:01] shows that you were not part of it
[2:03:04] [Music]
[2:03:06] am I reading a different Bible
[2:03:09] the Bible continue but
[2:03:12] they went out
[2:03:14] that they might be made what manifest
[2:03:17] imagine what they might be made known so
[2:03:20] you can know them
[2:03:22] they might be made known that they were
[2:03:25] not all of what in other words there is
[2:03:28] a group of people everybody claimed to
[2:03:31] be message believer
[2:03:32] [Music]
[2:03:34] but the time has come that some people
[2:03:37] must go out
[2:03:39] don't worry about it they must go out
[2:03:43] whether you like it or not they must go
[2:03:46] out
[2:03:47] and they're going out is showing you
[2:03:51] that they were not part of what you
[2:03:54] thought they were before
[2:03:56] you thought they were message believer
[2:03:59] but they were not message believing
[2:04:03] because Paul said they didn't have faith
[2:04:06] they didn't have the weapon as you know
[2:04:07] what they were with
[2:04:09] they were just part of the group but not
[2:04:12] part of the first
[2:04:15] amen being part of the message church is
[2:04:18] not good you must be part of the fact of
[2:04:22] the message then you know that you're a
[2:04:25] message believe
[2:04:26] [Applause]
[2:04:27] Amen brother
[2:04:29] let's continue
[2:04:31] verse 20.
[2:04:36] who have stayed you have the water an
[2:04:39] unction do you know what that means
[2:04:41] you have an anointed
[2:04:45] everybody okay those that left they also
[2:04:49] had an anointing among you
[2:04:51] yeah
[2:04:54] there are many preachers that are
[2:04:57] leaving this message and they preach
[2:04:59] this message on fire and the anointing
[2:05:02] was there but they reached two different
[2:05:05] anointings
[2:05:08] there is two oil
[2:05:12] amen the first oil make you work but it
[2:05:16] will stop at a certain time
[2:05:18] you need that second order that will
[2:05:21] take you all the way
[2:05:24] to the rapture
[2:05:25] the Bible says that by you have an
[2:05:28] option from the water Holy Ghost
[2:05:31] did you see that brother
[2:05:34] the Holy One and you know water all
[2:05:38] things
[2:05:39] oh
[2:05:45] [Music]
[2:05:50] is that the word it's the option of the
[2:05:53] fullness
[2:05:54] [Applause]
[2:05:58] amen everybody okay another one it's an
[2:06:02] option that is complete
[2:06:06] so there is a posture option
[2:06:10] oh
[2:06:11] and the fullness function that would not
[2:06:15] that make you know all the Mysteries
[2:06:17] everything must be unveiled
[2:06:24] yes sir what are you trying to say
[2:06:27] this is why brother Branham saying we
[2:06:29] like this I'm looking for a time of a
[2:06:33] breakfast
[2:06:34] of the water spirit of God in the last
[2:06:38] day that we are now living in for
[2:06:41] another word search of the water Holy
[2:06:44] Spirit
[2:06:45] defenses
[2:06:53] ain't nobody will care another one said
[2:06:56] just the water Holy Spirit the church
[2:06:59] for water the rapturing phase
[2:07:02] must bring you rapturing safe
[2:07:07] because the second oil was the oil that
[2:07:11] took the White Version all the way to
[2:07:14] the hospital it is the oil of rapturing
[2:07:17] pet it is that all of the groom it is
[2:07:20] the oil of the coming of the Lord it's
[2:07:24] an anointing that way you have it you
[2:07:27] cannot miss the bathroom
[2:07:29] [Music]
[2:07:31] everybody okay
[2:07:33] if it's bringing rupturing Faith let's
[2:07:36] look and Lord be at this brother Branham
[2:07:38] saying just before he comes and
[2:07:41] everything is sitting water straight in
[2:07:43] order for that and I believe that we are
[2:07:46] now at the time that the world should
[2:07:49] have water perfect yes
[2:07:51] keep that word I believe that the time
[2:07:54] to lay aside our water green our water
[2:07:57] and go back to the white world why nice
[2:08:01] well the problem says this
[2:08:04] then there is coming forth seven
[2:08:09] mysterious Thunders that is not even
[2:08:12] written what at all because when John
[2:08:15] wanted to write the angel say what
[2:08:18] for the messages
[2:08:20] perfectly in line with the scripture he
[2:08:23] said that's right and I believe that
[2:08:26] through those seven pandas will be
[2:08:29] revealed in the last day in order to get
[2:08:32] the bread together for what rapturing
[2:08:36] faith if the second search
[2:08:40] of the Holy Spirit bring rapturing Faith
[2:08:44] and the Seven Thunders bring rapturing
[2:08:48] fish
[2:08:50] I'm reading to you the prophet so the
[2:08:53] second to the seven candles is what
[2:09:00] the Revelation contained in the second
[2:09:05] so what breaks the seals is which
[2:09:09] anointing
[2:09:10] second oil
[2:09:15] everybody okay you see what people are
[2:09:18] rejecting the seals
[2:09:20] you see what they're rejecting the very
[2:09:23] thing that's gonna produce Rapture
[2:09:25] repair to bring you into the presence of
[2:09:28] God
[2:09:32] and you say you don't need to know
[2:09:34] themselves they are message preacher
[2:09:36] preparing the people you're gonna be
[2:09:38] disappointed
[2:09:41] [Applause]
[2:09:42] everybody okay brother Brandon said
[2:09:44] because
[2:09:46] wow
[2:09:47] what do we got what right now would not
[2:09:51] be able to do it what they got rather
[2:09:54] was not wrong
[2:09:57] it was the first story
[2:09:59] that was not enough to do the job
[2:10:04] [Music]
[2:10:10] and Pentecostal anointing is not enough
[2:10:15] to take you to the rapture
[2:10:19] hurry up
[2:10:21] I know what troubles you
[2:10:24] but give me time
[2:10:26] brother Branham says this there is
[2:10:29] something we got to go away step further
[2:10:32] and step water farther
[2:10:35] [Music]
[2:10:39] we we can't have enough
[2:10:41] safe for water healing hardly we got to
[2:10:46] have enough Faith to be what to change
[2:10:48] in the water Moment In The Sweep of the
[2:10:50] water do you think changing is a game no
[2:10:56] it's not any anointing that does that
[2:11:03] everybody okay when Abraham met Elohim
[2:11:07] his molecule changed
[2:11:10] Abraham became young again and Sarah
[2:11:13] became young again but Abraham made God
[2:11:17] many times before
[2:11:19] but he never changing only when God was
[2:11:23] made flesh amen
[2:11:27] foreign
[2:11:27] [Applause]
[2:11:34] God meant Abraham six times before
[2:11:38] Genesis 18 and Abraham never changed
[2:11:44] when he has a chance
[2:11:49] a discernment
[2:11:51] yes
[2:11:54] [Applause]
[2:12:03] Church
[2:12:07] [Applause]
[2:12:16] everybody okay why didn't Abraham change
[2:12:19] when God pulled him up why he didn't
[2:12:21] check because he still had the same
[2:12:23] problem he didn't have a baby God never
[2:12:26] changes God spoke to him God visited him
[2:12:30] God told him about the circumcision all
[2:12:32] of those things never change about until
[2:12:36] God came down
[2:12:37] [Applause]
[2:12:39] inhuman flesh
[2:12:42] the son of man and produce the Messiah
[2:12:46] the Sarah was checked and her bareness
[2:12:50] was taken out to produce the baby that
[2:12:54] she always runs for
[2:12:59] to produce the promises
[2:13:02] and to produce Jesus Christ you need
[2:13:06] that different Ministry
[2:13:08] [Applause]
[2:13:10] [Music]
[2:13:11] [Applause]
[2:13:18] the message
[2:13:21] everybody okay let's go to Genesis one
[2:13:27] Lord help me
[2:13:33] you don't need the seals you don't need
[2:13:34] the seals
[2:13:37] meaning you don't even know what the
[2:13:39] seals mean
[2:13:41] and we understand your ignorance but
[2:13:45] don't be bold in the error
[2:13:50] let's be humble
[2:13:52] call a brother you say brother help me
[2:13:54] understand this
[2:13:56] but instead of doing that we're blocking
[2:13:59] one another amen because we're afraid
[2:14:01] the ship will run away from the church
[2:14:04] but God opened streaming amen
[2:14:07] amen wherever they are they can tune in
[2:14:10] and they will blast
[2:14:13] foreign
[2:14:21] [Applause]
[2:14:36] you won't block them anymore God is
[2:14:40] tired
[2:14:42] [Music]
[2:14:48] verse 26 if you dare you can say amen
[2:14:51] amen we found out that when God verse 26
[2:14:55] and God said let us
[2:15:00] let us so that God Is Us
[2:15:06] everybody okay
[2:15:09] I won't please denomination because I'm
[2:15:12] not preaching to the moment I'm
[2:15:14] preaching to a pure message so I am and
[2:15:17] that message church is also the church I
[2:15:20] am Pastor so I'm totally free
[2:15:23] [Music]
[2:15:26] everybody okay so we got somebody here
[2:15:30] who's called God
[2:15:32] but that God is plural
[2:15:37] Is Us
[2:15:39] how is he son
[2:15:44] are we okay
[2:15:47] he said let us make man in our image and
[2:15:52] our water likeness and let them
[2:15:56] then this man them
[2:16:01] we're gonna make this man
[2:16:03] we're not already this managed man
[2:16:07] and it's female
[2:16:09] that's why they call them
[2:16:11] and let the them have water so Dominion
[2:16:16] is given to who yeah
[2:16:22] you don't want to get it that's your
[2:16:24] problem
[2:16:25] keep keep cooking
[2:16:28] everybody okay
[2:16:29] Dominion offers the water
[2:16:36] a woman
[2:16:50] that creepeth upon the Water Earth so a
[2:16:54] man and a woman are giving Dominion to
[2:16:58] adversy
[2:17:04] so God created who man in his own water
[2:17:09] image in the image of God created he
[2:17:12] watered him and what Man created he what
[2:17:16] and God did what
[2:17:19] God said to them be what fruitful not to
[2:17:22] one person
[2:17:24] eat them be fruitful and do what
[2:17:27] multiply and do what replenish the Earth
[2:17:30] subdue and have water Dominion which we
[2:17:33] already went through
[2:17:35] so if this man here is male and female
[2:17:40] and he's created in the image
[2:17:44] and in the likeness of God so this God
[2:17:48] here is also man and female
[2:17:53] this God Ismail
[2:17:56] and he's also female
[2:18:05] right I'm letting your reasoning reason
[2:18:09] so you mean we got a female Holocaust
[2:18:15] I know how your mind works
[2:18:18] and the man holy ghost are no higher man
[2:18:22] everybody okay
[2:18:23] to refresh you we found out that the
[2:18:27] tree of life was done
[2:18:29] brother random said now the bride are
[2:18:33] one tree life in other words like what
[2:18:35] husband
[2:18:37] one Christ and his brother what one same
[2:18:40] thing same Spirit same what works
[2:18:44] everything what everything else
[2:18:48] get stuff like
[2:18:51] that
[2:18:54] okay brother Branham says this he said
[2:18:57] he brings forth a broad tree which will
[2:19:02] be there Tree of Life restore water back
[2:19:06] to him so he is the Tree of Life the
[2:19:09] bride is the tree of life so when you
[2:19:12] take the bride back to God you're taking
[2:19:14] the tree of life back to the Tree of
[2:19:16] Life
[2:19:18] [Applause]
[2:19:21] you remember that wisdom
[2:19:23] you remember that wisdom that was
[2:19:25] creating she was a female
[2:19:28] yeah
[2:19:29] right as husband and wife in the Garden
[2:19:32] of Eden Oh Glory to God by the same
[2:19:35] water world and the same water God made
[2:19:38] manifest in husband and what why the
[2:19:41] same broad tree back again
[2:19:44] let me say it again this man in Genesis
[2:19:49] was not in Genesis 2. this man in
[2:19:53] Genesis 1 verse 26 to 27 or 28 this man
[2:19:59] is male and female and this female here
[2:20:04] is not a byproduct
[2:20:08] no
[2:20:09] no
[2:20:10] stop
[2:20:11] the female spirit is a reaching
[2:20:16] and the male spirit is so reaching and
[2:20:20] both of them are all reaching us
[2:20:27] what are you trying to say that's why
[2:20:29] it's good to go to sleep on Saturday on
[2:20:32] time so you don't struggle in church
[2:20:35] and if you shall notice how that is was
[2:20:39] United with who Adam she became what a
[2:20:42] part of him God did you notice in
[2:20:45] Genesis 1 27 he created man water male
[2:20:49] and female created him now the man was
[2:20:54] buff water male and female when it comes
[2:20:57] to being in the spirit of water and
[2:21:00] water masculine that God took from his
[2:21:03] sad area
[2:21:06] to the old patriarch did you notice the
[2:21:10] body part was the one by products spirit
[2:21:16] [Applause]
[2:21:18] why they don't read this book the
[2:21:21] scratch was there all along why I said
[2:21:24] believe I don't read that question
[2:21:28] let's be specific
[2:21:36] you're not searching you're gonna cut
[2:21:38] the nerves
[2:21:39] because you butchering people
[2:21:42] you need to learn the anatomy
[2:21:45] to know how you're using the blade
[2:21:48] [Music]
[2:21:50] the blood is not for you to carry
[2:21:54] everybody okay the body part of the
[2:21:57] woman was the Water by product I said
[2:21:59] the creation has been what finished
[2:22:01] again God took from the side of Adam
[2:22:04] away and made the water woman so in the
[2:22:08] beginning
[2:22:09] Linda Spirit form Madness male and
[2:22:13] female period both of them exactly the
[2:22:16] same and they had the same age
[2:22:22] [Applause]
[2:22:27] God never created man and the woman in
[2:22:31] another day no both of them they were
[2:22:33] twists
[2:22:34] damage
[2:22:36] salmon
[2:22:38] Sam blessing
[2:22:40] Sam Dominion
[2:22:42] [Applause]
[2:22:47] [Applause]
[2:22:53] everybody okay now in Genesis 2 7.
[2:23:00] everybody okay God make again man
[2:23:05] anybody okay whenever he makes men here
[2:23:09] he made man man when he appeared
[2:23:13] we were expecting this man to be doubled
[2:23:19] you okay but when men appear Man became
[2:23:24] single
[2:23:27] that's why the Bible said he was alone
[2:23:32] everybody okay so when this man came out
[2:23:38] you look you say God what did you do
[2:23:42] what is going on
[2:23:45] when we look at his blueprint he's too
[2:23:48] when we look over there into the body we
[2:23:52] see him one
[2:23:55] we need to see the second part
[2:23:59] You Follow Me Maybe people look they say
[2:24:02] God go ahead and create God came and he
[2:24:04] said it is not good
[2:24:07] that Adam must be what
[2:24:09] so technically speaking we expecting God
[2:24:12] to go ahead again and
[2:24:14] begin to work
[2:24:16] then God begin to show something yes
[2:24:19] yes he said you don't understand
[2:24:21] the man of Genesis 2 7. is also a double
[2:24:27] man
[2:24:30] do you follow me his body is double
[2:24:38] you following me that's why men
[2:24:41] naturally I say this and I'm repeating
[2:24:44] this man naturally have X and Y
[2:24:54] biologically speaking
[2:24:56] hey everybody okay so God was forced to
[2:25:00] go into man not another flesh do you
[2:25:04] follow me do you follow me and pull the
[2:25:08] X
[2:25:09] out of the man and when acts came out of
[2:25:14] a man he became what they call a woman
[2:25:18] he's shot
[2:25:20] which have on the X and X everybody okay

[2:29:38] Lord help me and Adam
[2:29:41] was lonesome
[2:29:43] and God to show that he could not be
[2:29:46] separated
[2:29:47] you follow me I'm going to get back into
[2:29:49] the same thing just a second look he
[2:29:53] never went and got dirt and made it easy
[2:30:06] and that was who Eve she was made for
[2:30:09] what the man and part of the water man
[2:30:12] she was part of him in the water
[2:30:14] beginning in the water Creation in the
[2:30:17] water theophany
[2:30:21] she was part of him down here in this
[2:30:24] creation she could not be divided
[2:30:28] into another creation she had to be made
[2:30:31] in the same creation that is exactly why
[2:30:35] Christ and God had to be the very sad
[2:30:38] person if he could it could not be any
[2:30:41] different anything different he had to
[2:30:44] be a good man or a prophet he would not
[2:30:47] have been a redeemer if he had been a
[2:30:49] good man he had to be the Creator
[2:30:51] himself but he's still the water
[2:30:53] theophany now you see the way he was
[2:30:56] then
[2:30:59] what are you trying to say brother
[2:31:01] Stephen
[2:31:02] the Bible said God is the wife of spirit
[2:31:05] and they that worship Him must worship
[2:31:08] Him in what spirited and Truth how many
[2:31:11] spirit is God today one
[2:31:16] here Isaiah they love your goddess
[2:31:20] Bible what spirit
[2:31:23] how can we have a female and a male
[2:31:25] spirit
[2:31:27] let's go to Genesis 2.
[2:31:32] Lord help me
[2:31:34] you there
[2:31:35] you there amen
[2:31:39] you there amen verse 22 and the rib
[2:31:42] which the Lord God you there which the
[2:31:45] Lord God had taken from man made he a
[2:31:49] woman and brought her to man to the man
[2:31:52] and Adam said
[2:31:54] this is now
[2:32:04] where is that this is now can you read
[2:32:08] it this is now bone of my bones and what
[2:32:11] Flesh of My Flesh if you notice born and
[2:32:14] flesh means what body good
[2:32:17] let's go back
[2:32:20] let's read it together again scripture
[2:32:22] don't play with words Adam said this is
[2:32:25] what
[2:32:27] this is what now
[2:32:31] now
[2:32:34] in other words he was not before
[2:32:41] are we okay everybody okay let's go
[2:32:44] slowly
[2:32:45] and Adam didn't say this is one of my
[2:32:48] friends
[2:32:50] treasure map no no no this is now
[2:32:54] because before Eve was not flesh of his
[2:32:58] face no it was not born of his world in
[2:33:02] other words it was not in the body yet
[2:33:06] I don't know if in the spirit
[2:33:09] but now if it's now
[2:33:13] and this is the house
[2:33:16] what now the woman is natural she's a
[2:33:20] human being like me
[2:33:26] oh did I lose you
[2:33:29] read your Bible 15 miles an hour
[2:33:33] behold my hands and my feet that it is I
[2:33:37] handle me and see foreign
[2:33:49] he created man in his own image and
[2:33:53] likeness so man and female were Spirit
[2:33:56] they were not flesh yet
[2:33:59] in Genesis 2 7 Adam and Lon began flesh
[2:34:05] and power but it was nothing not the if
[2:34:08] nature but the spirit of Eve was still
[2:34:12] hanging in it so God took from Adam and
[2:34:17] pulled the woman taken out of men the
[2:34:21] womb men out of a man and produces and
[2:34:26] he took the spirit of Eve that was still
[2:34:29] hanging around and put it in the body
[2:34:31] when he brought it to Adam Adam said now
[2:34:35] the if there was a spirit she is now
[2:34:39] woman
[2:34:50] okay did I lost anybody
[2:34:54] where are we going brother Stephen
[2:34:59] let's go down
[2:35:01] there
[2:35:02] for shall a man leave his words
[2:35:06] woman because she was taken out of me
[2:35:08] and clinged to his wife and there shall
[2:35:11] be Heavenly flesh one
[2:35:14] there shall be one flesh when man and a
[2:35:19] woman will do what
[2:35:23] let's read it again
[2:35:25] therefore shall water man amen leave his
[2:35:29] water father and his what mother and
[2:35:32] shall cling to his what wife
[2:35:34] not to the woman
[2:35:37] shall not cling to the woman
[2:35:42] did you see that he didn't say shall
[2:35:44] cling to the woman because you will go
[2:35:46] outside and begin to cling to Every
[2:35:48] Woman
[2:35:50] you know you don't you don't cling to
[2:35:52] Every Woman
[2:35:53] you need to be first engaged
[2:35:56] when you engage you have not United yet
[2:36:01] amen but she is already your wife
[2:36:03] that's the woman that you
[2:36:08] cannot continue
[2:36:09] cleave to your wife and this shall be
[2:36:12] what one flesh so you are one flesh when
[2:36:15] you are flesh
[2:36:19] and his flesh
[2:36:21] both of the flesh
[2:36:25] are you following me then you become one
[2:36:28] in flesh
[2:36:33] I can say things
[2:36:35] but it's a mixed audience
[2:36:43] I hope you get it yes
[2:36:45] yes I hope you get it that's why it
[2:36:47] matches
[2:36:53] let's go to verse 25 and there were both
[2:36:57] water naked the man and his wife and
[2:36:59] were not what the shame in other words
[2:37:02] Adam
[2:37:04] never made it to the flesh yet
[2:37:12] So Adam and Eve even though they were
[2:37:15] married
[2:37:16] but they didn't consume met here because
[2:37:19] when they consume it that's when the
[2:37:21] eyes were what
[2:37:26] William Marion brother Branham said God
[2:37:30] made him help me out of his own water
[2:37:33] body perhaps a rib from over his water
[2:37:37] hard so she should be close to what him
[2:37:40] and made him a water help me he really
[2:37:43] was not his wife as yes
[2:37:48] if I didn't explain you you're going to
[2:37:50] have a hard time a wife yet in the flesh
[2:37:53] you get it
[2:37:55] he really was not his wife yet no more
[2:37:58] than he was a man as what yeah he had
[2:38:01] just worked spoken they were United in
[2:38:03] the altar God brought them to church
[2:38:06] and unite them in church and they went
[2:38:08] but they were not United yet
[2:38:11] everybody okay and there is what the
[2:38:15] water Trouble Comes Satan found her
[2:38:19] before what Adam did he was just his
[2:38:21] water world
[2:38:24] wow
[2:38:25] you're following me amen so before the
[2:38:29] woman meet the man
[2:38:33] naturally
[2:38:34] physically in between the espouses
[2:38:39] and the physical coming
[2:38:43] that's what the serpent entered
[2:38:47] because remember Paul said in the
[2:38:50] beginning of the church ages that I have
[2:38:52] his past
[2:38:54] but he was not marriage yet
[2:38:57] and in between his passing of power and
[2:39:01] the marriage and the end time in between
[2:39:03] the serpent came
[2:39:07] the Great Dragon the red dragon with 10
[2:39:12] horn and seventh head came in between
[2:39:14] and made again the second he fell
[2:39:22] a is he clicking now
[2:39:25] what are you trying to say brother
[2:39:27] Stephen
[2:39:28] the Bible said for Adam was what first
[2:39:32] form that one is
[2:39:38] deceived what's in the water
[2:39:40] transgression why was not Adam deceived
[2:39:48] why was not Adam deceived
[2:39:53] are you there
[2:39:54] why was not Adam deceived
[2:39:59] deceived
[2:40:03] everybody okay Paul said for a man
[2:40:06] indeed
[2:40:10] ought not to cover his head
[2:40:12] for as much as he is the one image and
[2:40:15] the water Glory
[2:40:19] man God
[2:40:21] that created man was how male female and
[2:40:26] man that he created was wow male and
[2:40:28] female and Adam in his body he was loud
[2:40:31] male and female but the woman is only
[2:40:34] water female
[2:40:38] she's not reflecting God in her body
[2:40:47] that's why they play with the woman body
[2:40:50] that's why they play with it all the
[2:40:52] time
[2:40:53] everybody okay they said for as much as
[2:40:56] is the image and glory of God but the
[2:40:59] woman is the glory of the water man
[2:41:03] you ready for the man is not of the
[2:41:08] woman but the woman of the man was the
[2:41:11] man that gives birth
[2:41:14] to the woman
[2:41:15] everybody okay neither was the Man
[2:41:18] created for what the woman by the woman
[2:41:21] for water the man because Adam was the
[2:41:23] Lord
[2:41:25] so God was worrying about Adam not
[2:41:28] having Fellowship
[2:41:32] that's why Malachi say that she is your
[2:41:35] companion
[2:41:38] everybody okay for this cause of demand
[2:41:42] to have power on her head of the woman
[2:41:46] to have power off on her head because of

[2:45:37] Love
[2:45:38] amen but she's lacking the way
[2:45:42] and because she locked away she just
[2:45:45] have to Humble herself
[2:45:48] in order to allow the wife to express
[2:45:52] toward him
[2:45:54] Hallelujah
[2:45:56] amen well I mean
[2:45:59] she have to submit to the headship by
[2:46:04] submitting to the headship the man now
[2:46:07] after he already got the woman after the
[2:46:10] sister already said yes I love you you
[2:46:12] will see him now begin to bring his
[2:46:15] manhood out

[2:46:19] and she needed for her protection
[2:46:23] relaxing
[2:46:29] hey man amen
[2:46:32] the serpent met Eve alone
[2:46:39] the serpent meant to eat water she was
[2:46:43] limited to the level of a female spirit
[2:46:47] and then and that's why she fell in
[2:46:50] order for Eve not to fail
[2:46:52] you need to bring the marriage
[2:46:55] you need to take Eve back to the man
[2:46:58] make sure Adam is present
[2:47:01] because when
[2:47:03] I present then why that was missing is
[2:47:07] already there there is not that's why
[2:47:10] Adam was never deceived I don't get that
[2:47:15] BDC what protected Adam is the wife so
[2:47:19] what the man is coming he's going to
[2:47:22] engage the wife

[2:47:41] done when the husband is
[2:47:45] [Applause]
[2:47:49] everybody okay why because the woman
[2:47:52] must learn how to submit herself how to
[2:47:56] give preeminence to the Head
[2:47:59] and the more you submit the more the
[2:48:03] health is expressing
[2:48:07] begin to express then what you are
[2:48:10] lacking in your life you begin to have
[2:48:12] it now you are complete
[2:48:20] the ring that you can resisted is not a
[2:48:23] game when you show somebody the ring you
[2:48:26] are telling him this this is the why
[2:48:28] that I was missing
[2:48:31] now I am X and Y
[2:48:38] [Music]
[2:48:42] 'all
[2:48:44] everybody okay everybody okay everybody
[2:48:47] okay
[2:48:49] that's why a dominating woman is a curse
[2:48:53] [Applause]
[2:49:03] that I know
[2:49:05] not a woman now a woman
[2:49:09] is not meant to have a water I am in
[2:49:13] this position she is according to the
[2:49:15] Holy Spirit a scripture to be what
[2:49:17] submissive to the water well that is
[2:49:20] commanded of what her woman who is what
[2:49:23] truly female
[2:49:26] will be in that water disposition
[2:49:36] when you are dominating your home
[2:49:42] you are getting the picture wrong
[2:49:46] what God is looking at you he wants you
[2:49:50] he wants the husband to send love
[2:49:53] and you submit when both of you hope
[2:49:56] together like that God get in the middle
[2:49:59] of it
[2:50:00] and he forced the marriage nothing will
[2:50:03] happen to you
[2:50:04] [Applause]
[2:50:09] everybody okay but this society and all
[2:50:13] over the world have promoted the
[2:50:15] domination of the woman
[2:50:20] come on
[2:50:23] there is two kind of domination
[2:50:26] there is a planned domination
[2:50:29] that a woman expresses herself no
[2:50:33] I don't like it and she started since
[2:50:36] childhood
[2:50:39] and usually daddy is the one that
[2:50:43] breathed the spirit
[2:50:50] thinking he's showing love
[2:50:52] not understanding that he's making her
[2:50:56] future worse
[2:50:57] [Applause]
[2:50:58] because everything that women want she's
[2:51:02] getting it
[2:51:04] not through Mommy it's Daddy
[2:51:10] everybody okay and she's learning to
[2:51:14] manipulate
[2:51:21] [Applause]
[2:51:24] ever
[2:51:26] everybody will come so there is two kind
[2:51:29] of manipulation there is a blind strict
[2:51:32] manipulation and two kind of domination
[2:51:35] there is a domination where a woman have
[2:51:38] an eye on this position she does a woman
[2:51:41] she doesn't want it no no
[2:51:43] and if she's angry the whole home is
[2:51:46] shaking
[2:51:53] just go visit them without telling them
[2:51:56] I'm coming
[2:51:57] [Applause]
[2:51:59] yelling from the street
[2:52:04] everybody okay but the most deadly one
[2:52:07] is a woman that have a domination with
[2:52:12] manipulation
[2:52:13] [Applause]
[2:52:20] I have to cut it off
[2:52:22] everybody okay what is that manipulation
[2:52:26] that manipulation is a religious spirit
[2:52:31] [Applause]
[2:52:32] and that spirit is usually mingled with

[2:55:04] sometimes we attack children to be
[2:55:07] hard-headed to be stubborn we don't
[2:55:09] understand it's somebody who's
[2:55:11] responsible for that

[3:06:13] loved the church if you love your wife
[3:06:16] if you cherish her you are loving

[3:06:21] woman came out of you the woman that you
[3:06:24] when you get married to a woman you are
[3:06:27] telling that woman that the one that
[3:06:29] came out of me is you you are me in the
[3:06:32] feminine version so what I was missing
