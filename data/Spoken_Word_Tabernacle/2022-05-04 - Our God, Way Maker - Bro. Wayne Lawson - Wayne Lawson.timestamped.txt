[41:24] i said with a gift like yours i would
[41:27] never do nothing but preach the gospel
[41:29] of jesus christ

[42:57] word and you would speak something to
[42:59] the need of the congregation lord
[43:02] and lord we commit this meeting into thy
[43:04] faithful hands in the name of jesus
[43:06] christ we pray
[43:08] amen
[43:10] and amen and god bless you if you have
[43:13] your bibles with you tonight
[43:15] i would like to read from the book of
[43:16] isaiah the 50th chapter
[43:20] and i want to read here something that's
[43:22] just very
[43:25] just on my heart so i want to share it
[43:27] with you
[43:28] in the seventh verse
[43:31] let the wicked forsake his way
[43:34] and the unrighteous man his thoughts
[43:37] and let him return to the lord and he
[43:40] will have mercy upon him
[43:45] and to our god he will abundantly pardon
[43:49] for my thoughts
[43:51] they are not your thoughts
[43:53] and neither are your ways my ways saith
[43:56] the lord
[43:57] for as the heavens are higher than the
[43:59] earth so are my ways higher than your
[44:01] ways and my thoughts than your thoughts
[44:04] and as the rain cometh down
[44:06] and the snow from the heaven and
[44:07] returneth not to there but watereth the
[44:09] earth and make it bring forth bud that
[44:12] it may give
[44:13] seed to the sower
[44:15] and bread to the eater
[44:17] soul shall my word be that goeth forth
[44:20] out of my mouth it shall not return
[44:22] unto me void
[44:24] but it shall accomplish that what i
[44:26] please and it shall prosper
[44:29] in the thing where unto
[44:32] i sent it
[44:33] we ask the lord to bless his word
[44:34] tonight as you can be seated with me i
[44:37] want to just speak to you on a little
[44:39] subject tonight that's on our heart i
[44:41] want to speak to you about our god
[44:44] the waymaker
[44:46] our god
[44:47] the waymaker
[44:49] amen i i want you maybe just to from my
[44:52] heart to say to you i believe this i
[44:55] believe god has only one way of doing
[44:57] anything
[44:59] i believe god has one way of doing
[45:01] anything and and isaiah was so uh
[45:05] he was so straightforward in telling us
[45:07] very directly that our ways are not
[45:10] god's ways and neither our thoughts
[45:12] god's thoughts as his ways are higher
[45:15] and his thoughts are higher
[45:17] and so when isaiah says this brother
[45:19] branham will pick this up and he'll say
[45:21] some things very very good for us he'll
[45:23] say there's only one way
[45:25] to do anything and that's god's way
[45:28] if you want to do something you want to
[45:30] do it god's way
[45:31] now outside of that
[45:33] he says now it's all off because it will
[45:36] not reproduce itself he said i got
[45:38] scriptures and things to prove uh to
[45:40] prove that here if
[45:42] brother give me a little bit in the
[45:43] monitor on the side and i'll i'll
[45:45] control it from here a little bit he
[45:47] said there's only one way to do it and
[45:49] that's god's way
[45:50] god always had a way
[45:53] and there's two ways see that's our way
[45:56] and his way
[45:58] and god has a way for today
[46:00] he always makes a way for everything so
[46:04] god makes a way and he actually has a
[46:07] way for today now the prophet of god
[46:09] will tell us of course then that there
[46:11] is god's way in your way and that your
[46:14] way is always the wrong way
[46:17] isn't that something that god has a way
[46:20] and you have a way
[46:21] but your way is the wrong way amen and
[46:24] he says now you can't be
[46:26] in god's way and your way at the same
[46:29] time
[46:30] he says see it's it's this way you're
[46:32] either your way is always the wrong way
[46:35] and god's way is always the right way
[46:37] and you cannot be in your own way and
[46:40] god's way at the same time so you've got
[46:43] to get out of your own way so god can
[46:45] have his way
[46:47] in god's provided way
[46:50] you see what it's god's got a way amen
[46:52] he's if you're going to have your way
[46:54] you're out of god's way immediately when
[46:56] you say well i'm going to do it my way
[46:58] you're out of god's way
[47:00] because you can't do them both god can
[47:03] have his way when you cease from your
[47:06] way but as long as you're having way god
[47:08] can't have his way i think sometimes we
[47:10] are to just say god come and have your
[47:12] way lord come and have your way in my
[47:15] life come and have your way in the
[47:17] church come and have your way in our
[47:19] homes amen because what we really want
[47:22] is we want god to have his own way
[47:24] that's what we're wanting as long as
[47:26] you're in your way then you're out of
[47:28] his way so then forsake your way amen
[47:31] then forsake your thought then forsake
[47:34] everything and rely on one thing that's
[47:37] thus saith the lord amen i certainly
[47:41] believe that the message of william
[47:42] branham is thus saith the lord so
[47:46] anytime you're out of the message way of
[47:48] doing things you're in your own way of
[47:50] doing things so you're in the wrong way
[47:52] of doing things amen and god's only got
[47:55] one way and that's in thus saith the
[47:57] lord and if you can ever find out god's
[47:59] way of doing it it's the only way of
[48:01] doing it
[48:03] jesus said i am the way
[48:05] the truth and the life he didn't say it
[48:07] but three ways there's only one way and
[48:10] it's a new and living way and that is
[48:12] christ amen the anointed word is the way
[48:16] that god does anything you've got to
[48:17] find god's way of doing it god has a way
[48:20] in this age to do things amen and i
[48:23] believe we're i believe we're living in
[48:24] that age he had a way to do it in the
[48:26] days of martin luther he had a ways to
[48:29] do it in the days of wesley and he had a
[48:31] way to do it in the pentecostals and
[48:32] they found god's way then if we find
[48:35] god's way to do it in this age then
[48:38] that'll be the same way whether we're in
[48:40] jamaica or we're in africa or we're in
[48:42] america or we're in italy or we're in
[48:45] india it'll be god's way because god's
[48:48] way is an international way
[48:50] it's not it's not to race it's not so
[48:52] society it's not to education it's god's
[48:56] way to mankind to provide anything that
[48:59] god's going to do god's way of doing
[49:02] anything is spoken in the word of god
[49:05] amen when god does it it'll be in the
[49:07] word amen so if you're outside the words
[49:09] you're outside of god's way of doing
[49:12] things now i know i mean i know what it
[49:14] is i know how men are
[49:16] i said okay if i take this jacket off
[49:19] amen do you see what it is man has a way
[49:21] of doing things and he always is trying
[49:24] to find a better way to do things you
[49:27] know sometimes you don't need to find a
[49:29] better way you need to rest in god's way
[49:32] amen and everybody's looking for a
[49:34] better way to do everything but
[49:35] sometimes you've got to recognize we
[49:38] already have the best way to do it we
[49:40] just need to persist in god's way of
[49:43] doing it he meant you so bro brother
[49:45] it's not working it works i promise you
[49:48] the message works
[49:50] are you going to persist in the way god
[49:52] has provided for you i mean are you
[49:54] going to throw down your tools and look
[49:56] for another way let me promise you
[49:58] there's not a better way to get where
[50:01] we're going than what god has provided
[50:03] in this age amen this is the way god
[50:06] does things so you persist in it i i
[50:08] know what it is people say to me all the
[50:10] time well it's too hard but but
[50:11] persistence is a word that is used when
[50:14] things are hard not when things are easy
[50:17] and let me promise you this god's way is
[50:19] the harder way the way god makes a
[50:22] harder way to go but there's somebody
[50:24] going to see that's god's way so we're
[50:27] going to persist
[50:29] until we get where we're going because
[50:31] that's god's way of doing things i
[50:33] believe that i believe persistence is
[50:36] when you come up against opposition but
[50:38] you're going to do it anyhow ain't been
[50:40] persistence is when you get against
[50:42] adversity but you're gonna do it anyhow
[50:45] because you know it's the right way to
[50:47] do it amen and god has chose a harder
[50:50] way for the church but that is the way
[50:52] of god and it'll provide a provision
[50:55] that there ain't no other way going to
[50:57] provide amen i believe that i believe
[50:59] god gave us examples and i'm i'm just an
[51:02] old hillbilly and i see things simple
[51:04] amen but the prophet of god said it
[51:06] clearly he said listen god provides you
[51:08] with a way to do things and you can look
[51:10] for a better way but there ain't a
[51:11] better way than god's way
[51:13] there may be a little work in it but
[51:14] you've got to do what god provided and
[51:16] that'll be the best way to do it brother
[51:18] ma'am said it he said they've been
[51:19] looking for a better way for a chicken
[51:21] to be born for years
[51:23] they're looking for a better way but
[51:25] there was no better way
[51:27] i don't care what you do there's not a
[51:28] better way there's not a better way for
[51:30] a chicken to guide an egg than to beat
[51:33] his way out of that egg that's god's way
[51:36] now he has to persist in that he has to
[51:38] be able to persist in that he has to get
[51:40] out of that egg you all know what it's
[51:42] called it's called peeping your way out
[51:44] of the egg
[51:45] hey man you it's called peeping your way
[51:46] out there you know before a chicken can
[51:48] get out of egg he's got to have
[51:50] something inside the eggshell to get out
[51:52] of the egg do you know that god supplies
[51:55] him what he needs to get out of the egg
[51:59] and he puts it in his beak isn't it
[52:01] funny brother man said the beak is built
[52:03] a certain way
[52:04] is that right that it can beat its way
[52:07] out of the shell and when it beats its
[52:09] way out of the shell it gains something
[52:11] every time it strikes against the shell
[52:14] it gains something amen it's nothing
[52:16] different than a believer you're going
[52:18] to get out of what you're in by the by
[52:21] your mouth
[52:22] you're going to get out by your mouth
[52:25] amen and the faith that's coming out of
[52:27] your mouth it comes god's provided way
[52:30] it comes by the spoken word and paul
[52:33] said it he said the word of faith is
[52:35] that what i preach
[52:37] and tonight you may be in the middle of
[52:39] one of the greatest trials of your life
[52:41] but if you'll take the word that's being
[52:43] preached to you right now it's god's way
[52:45] to provide you a way to break out of
[52:48] that situation that you're under and let
[52:51] the holy ghost come inside you and move
[52:54] in a special way you say well i just
[52:56] keep beating up against this i keep
[52:58] beating up against it well it's god's
[53:00] way brother amen keep prophesying over
[53:03] your situation until every devil is
[53:06] defeated until every power is broken we
[53:09] are god's children we've got god's way
[53:11] and it works tonight god's way works
[53:15] if you'll take it as an example an old
[53:17] chicken getting out of an egg hey man he
[53:19] gotta beat his way out of that egg
[53:22] i'm sorry it's a beautiful picture if
[53:24] you see it
[53:26] that you it's going to work that little
[53:28] that that chicken don't think so the
[53:30] first day but it's going to work you all
[53:33] know how long it takes for him to get
[53:34] out it takes him 21 days
[53:37] isn't that something takes him 21 days
[53:40] 21 days takes him get out that egg isn't
[53:43] it something that god told daniel he
[53:45] said i heard you the first time you
[53:47] prayed but it was 21 days amen until he
[53:51] found what he was looking for and let me
[53:53] tell you tonight you may have started 21
[53:56] days ago but you don't give up you don't
[53:59] turn over you don't let it go if you
[54:01] found
[54:02] god's way you need to persist until you
[54:06] get through the trial until you get
[54:08] through the problem whatever it is amen
[54:11] you said preacher i'm having a hard time
[54:13] being persistent you need to hear what
[54:15] moses heard brother brahman said why
[54:17] moses could persist is because he heard
[54:20] god's voice in god's presence and when
[54:23] you get in the presence of god and you
[54:26] hear the voice of god then you can be
[54:28] persistent no matter what comes
[54:31] no matter what come listen i'm talking
[54:33] about a god that makes a way amen our
[54:35] god makes the way
[54:37] you say well i don't know if he'll make
[54:38] a way through my problem look he gave us
[54:41] an example in moses and brother branham
[54:44] said it he said the red sea was an
[54:46] example he said that god will make a way
[54:50] when there certainly is just no way
[54:52] when there's no way to get over your
[54:54] situation he said read moses as an
[54:58] example and you can see that god can
[55:01] make a way when there is no way when you
[55:04] are going god's provided way god will
[55:07] move a red sea out of you
[55:10] hallelujah i know the red sea is in the
[55:12] way but god provides a way over it
[55:17] come on y'all know how i'm telling you
[55:18] the truth
[55:20] you know i'm telling you the truth
[55:21] there's a way over that sea and moses
[55:24] found out you can't cry your way over
[55:26] that sea
[55:27] you can't beg your way over that sea god
[55:30] got on to moses for thinking that he
[55:32] said why are you crying to me
[55:35] speak the word of god that you and this
[55:38] people can go forward i think god's got
[55:40] a way he's got a way he created the
[55:42] heavens he got away he created the earth
[55:45] he got away he created the ocean it was
[55:47] by the spoken word and that same god
[55:50] tonight has created you to use the word
[55:53] to speak against the situation if thou
[55:56] shall say unto this mountain be thou
[55:59] moved and cast into the sea it shall be
[56:02] as you have said if you will not doubt
[56:04] it in your heart
[56:07] i believe the word is god's way of doing
[56:09] it
[56:11] yes sir it's a provided way it's the way
[56:14] god provided to do it
[56:17] you know that's what god's given
[56:19] people looking for a better way to get
[56:21] saved
[56:22] no there's no better way
[56:25] there's no better way
[56:26] so well they think they can do something
[56:28] a special way and no sir there's no
[56:30] better way what god provided is the way.
[56:35] what god said is the way
[56:38] now i know
[56:39] i know a birth can get messy
[56:42] i know it but it's god's way
[56:46] it's god's way to die out from sin it's
[56:48] god's way to repent and be baptized it's
[56:51] god's way to do it and if god's got a
[56:54] way that's the way to be doing it amen
[56:56] and you just keep doing it somebody said
[56:58] well i knew somebody that did that and
[57:00] didn't get through now they just didn't
[57:02] do it god's way

[57:11] holy ghost

[57:16] halfway god he don't halfway save you he
[57:20] don't halfway sanctify you he don't
[57:22] halfway fill you with the holy ghost but
[57:25] my god filled the rivers and the floods
[57:27] and he filled the oceans with water he
[57:30] can still feel a church of the living
[57:32] god with a baptism of the holy ghost it
[57:35] can fill every fiber of your body the
[57:38] dynamics of this church
[57:40] is a refilling of the holy ghost and my
[57:43] god has a holy ghost to give you tonight

[57:58] young man coming to prayer line one time
[58:00] says to me said i've been after meeting
[58:01] after meeting after meeting i did this
[58:03] and this and this and god still ain't
[58:05] giving me the holy ghost like god wasn't
[58:07] keeping his word i said let me say if i
[58:10] promised you that i give you a dollar
[58:12] and i already give you three quarters of
[58:15] a quarter at a time and i gave you 75
[58:17] cents now now if i've already justified
[58:20] you and sanctified you
[58:22] [Music]
[58:24] why would you not think i'll go ahead
[58:26] and give you the rest of it
[58:28] if god's already justified you and
[58:30] sanctified you and brought you in this
[58:32] church what makes you believe that god
[58:34] won't go home and give you the rest of
[58:36] him
[58:36] i believe i come all the way down here
[58:38] tonight to tell you god's got a way to
[58:41] give you the holy ghost god has provided
[58:44] a way to sanctify a church and to fill
[58:47] it with the power of god
[58:49] my god is a waymaker and he makes a way
[58:53] where there is no way
[58:56] well there's no hope
[58:58] well there's no lie he can make life he
[59:01] can make a way
[59:04] so well
[59:05] brother i'm afraid if i get in that
[59:07] anointing i might scream and shout like
[59:09] the rest of these people well you might
[59:11] but that's god's way
[59:13] that's god's way it's the way god does
[59:15] things brother man said i don't care if
[59:18] you squall and speak in tongues or jump
[59:20] up and down or i like this one flop like
[59:23] a chicken with your head off he said it
[59:26] brings forth new life
[59:30] come on shaking hands don't bring life
[59:33] put your name on the book don't blame
[59:34] life but the word preached in his season
[59:38] will bring life into a body and there'll
[59:41] be a new birth unto that church because
[59:44] the holy ghost will come where the word
[59:46] is being preached
[59:51] [Music]
[59:53] ah people don't want god's way
[59:55] they don't want god's way brother and
[59:57] said they don't he said they don't want
[59:59] it he said they're bringing church
[1:00:00] members all the time he said but see
[1:00:02] what they don't want is their max 238
[1:00:06] tone talking babies the only kind this
[1:00:09] word will produce do you see what's
[1:00:12] going on god has a way and when that way
[1:00:14] comes it will produce things that the
[1:00:17] nominal church is not comfortable with
[1:00:20] just the ordinary church is not
[1:00:22] comfortable with the power of the word
[1:00:24] bringing emotion and life and strength
[1:00:29] i know what i'm talking about people say
[1:00:31] to me all the time so y'all's like a
[1:00:32] bunch of pentecostals well let me ask
[1:00:34] you this who's playing the music
[1:00:37] there ain't no music going on up here
[1:00:39] there ain't nobody shouting over the
[1:00:41] mics and got a bunch of piano music and
[1:00:44] singing it up no sir this congregation
[1:00:47] is stirred by the preaching of the word
[1:00:50] of god it's god's way of revival it's
[1:00:54] god's power of revival
[1:00:59] listen those pentecostals can shout and
[1:01:02] scream at the playing of a guitar what
[1:01:06] are the church be able to do at the
[1:01:08] preaching of the riches of the mysteries
[1:01:10] of god in the evening time we are living
[1:01:13] in the hour of the dissension of the
[1:01:16] mighty angel to come down and to stare
[1:01:21] yeah i'm stirred up but it's a seven
[1:01:24] thunder stare it's a manifestation of
[1:01:27] life that is coming to this age it's an
[1:01:30] adoption manifestation it's a word
[1:01:33] manifestation it's god
[1:01:37] his way
[1:01:41] his way
[1:01:43] come on church
[1:01:45] our god don't attend funerals
[1:01:49] everywhere he went there was life
[1:01:51] and if he's here
[1:01:53] there'll be life here if his word is
[1:01:56] here
[1:01:57] the life of the world will be here
[1:02:01] you say well what are you talking about
[1:02:03] this is what i'm talking about you
[1:02:04] wonder what it was like on the day of
[1:02:06] pentecost well brother this is that
[1:02:10] this is that it's the stimulating power
[1:02:13] of god's word
[1:02:16] in its age
[1:02:18] god don't have a better way
[1:02:21] he don't have a better way to stir a
[1:02:23] crowd he don't have a better way to heal
[1:02:25] the sick he don't have a better way to
[1:02:27] save the lost
[1:02:29] it's his word and his power of his word
[1:02:32] is almighty
[1:02:37] i tell you what you can find this in the
[1:02:39] word
[1:02:41] you can find it in the word
[1:02:44] you know what you can't find
[1:02:45] you can't find that dry intellectual
[1:02:48] denominational way and approaching
[1:02:51] things
[1:02:52] i find i find it funny sometimes you're
[1:02:55] sitting in the back room or church and
[1:02:57] they and they up here singing and
[1:02:58] playing and everybody's shouting
[1:03:01] you come out and read one scripture and
[1:03:03] everybody shuts up
[1:03:06] that's backwards
[1:03:09] that's backwards
[1:03:10] we ought to get the song service over so
[1:03:12] we can get to the word of god
[1:03:16] that's what david was dancing about
[1:03:18] david was dancing about the word that
[1:03:20] was returning to the age
[1:03:26] people said well
[1:03:28] you people are pentecostal really when
[1:03:31] have you ever seen pentecost shout over
[1:03:33] seven thunders when you ever see
[1:03:36] pentecostal shout over adoption
[1:03:39] or the godhead
[1:03:41] pentecostals don't shout over that they
[1:03:44] choke on it brother they choke and get
[1:03:46] quiet but the bride the church of the
[1:03:49] living god is scared by the power of the
[1:03:52] holy ghost speaking the word that's
[1:03:55] god's way of doing it
[1:03:59] i think it's time i think it's time to
[1:04:01] persist i think it's time to move
[1:04:04] forward i think the word must be
[1:04:06] preached in its hour and it's season
[1:04:10] amen i know i know the whole world right
[1:04:12] now they're praying for the messiah to
[1:04:14] come
[1:04:16] the whole world right now they're
[1:04:18] praying for the messiah to come but
[1:04:20] brother man said if the messiah come he
[1:04:22] would have to come god's way of coming
[1:04:26] they got away
[1:04:28] they got a way for him to come
[1:04:30] they got away and if he comes he'll come
[1:04:33] his way
[1:04:34] is that right
[1:04:35] he won't come through denomination he
[1:04:37] won't come through system he won't come
[1:04:40] through emotion he'll come by god's
[1:04:42] anointed system
[1:04:46] the word
[1:04:48] and the word cannot come without a
[1:04:50] prophet but when a prophet speaks he's
[1:04:53] introducing headship the messiah will
[1:04:56] come through a prophetic message
[1:05:00] do you think this generation of warning
[1:05:02] no they'll refuse it the bible says they
[1:05:05] refuse him
[1:05:07] but the prophet said he will not see a
[1:05:08] messiah in vain
[1:05:10] if he's going to sin messiah there will
[1:05:13] be somebody who will receive the messiah
[1:05:18] [Applause]
[1:05:19] come on god don't give you what you want
[1:05:22] he gives you what you need
[1:05:23] [Music]
[1:05:24] and what the world needed
[1:05:27] was a message anointed with a messiah
[1:05:31] they need leadership to get out of
[1:05:33] laodicea they need leadership to have an
[1:05:36] exodus out of the church into the bride
[1:05:39] they needed a god who could take them
[1:05:41] out of dark denominationalism
[1:05:43] and lead them into blind manifestation
[1:05:46] they needed somebody who could lead them
[1:05:48] out but when god sent it they rejected
[1:05:50] it but there is a group called the bride
[1:05:54] who has received the messiah
[1:05:57] and they know the message of the hour
[1:06:02] messiah is not some man messiah is the
[1:06:05] spirit of almighty god
[1:06:11] sure it's god's way brother man said
[1:06:13] they're praying for jesus
[1:06:15] he said they're saying lord send jesus
[1:06:17] send jesus send jesus he said and when
[1:06:19] the holy ghost come they rejected it
[1:06:24] come on it's a christ rejecting
[1:06:26] generation
[1:06:27] but there's a predestinated seed
[1:06:29] somewhere
[1:06:31] that was looking for god's way
[1:06:34] may i say tonight we have found god's
[1:06:37] way
[1:06:39] walk ye therefore in it we have found
[1:06:42] god's way we are not looking we are not
[1:06:45] searching we are not trying to find we
[1:06:48] have found the passage
[1:06:51] that leads to another dimension we have
[1:06:53] found the passage that enoch walked to
[1:06:56] get into glory we have found the passage
[1:07:00] that will lead us back to every
[1:07:01] redemptive right that god has given to
[1:07:04] the church
[1:07:06] we're not looking for it we have found
[1:07:08] it
[1:07:10] we have found our messiah
[1:07:14] something that will lead us
[1:07:19] come on church
[1:07:21] it'll take a bribe to amen that it'll
[1:07:23] take a word church to amen that what we
[1:07:27] have found we have not found just a
[1:07:29] message we have not just found another
[1:07:32] prophet we have not just found another
[1:07:34] church
[1:07:36] we have found the messiah that will lead
[1:07:39] this generation into the bride's revival
[1:07:43] of the age we're living in
[1:07:48] it's god's system
[1:07:50] it's god's anointed system it's the word
[1:07:53] and the spirit that's leading the church
[1:07:57] this is what god is doing
[1:07:59] come on now everything's going to be
[1:08:01] shaken
[1:08:03] everything in this earth is going to be
[1:08:04] shaken is that right you know why
[1:08:07] the answers in the world falling apart
[1:08:10] he said they have rejected the word that
[1:08:12] is the foundations it's the foundations
[1:08:15] and by rejecting that word they're
[1:08:17] falling apart
[1:08:20] they didn't receive god's way to hold it
[1:08:23] together so it's falling apart
[1:08:27] watch what the devil did the devil said
[1:08:29] i'll ascend under heaven and i'll make
[1:08:31] my throne
[1:08:32] like his throne i will ascend above
[1:08:36] and the way listen to me the way
[1:08:38] the way the devil did it
[1:08:40] was he devalued the word in the garden
[1:08:43] of eden
[1:08:45] he convinced the angels to follow him in
[1:08:48] their fallen estate
[1:08:51] now isaiah said it was in his heart
[1:08:54] that he wanted to do it but in second
[1:08:56] thessalonians brother branham saw he
[1:08:58] said paul saw him in position
[1:09:01] when he exalted himself above
[1:09:04] the vindicated word of the age
[1:09:08] the vindicated word of this age
[1:09:11] is the messiah of this age and when
[1:09:15] somebody exalts themselves above it
[1:09:22] satan built his kingdom by fallen angels
[1:09:24] brother ryan said he does the same thing
[1:09:26] today by falling preachers
[1:09:30] they fall from the anointing they fall
[1:09:33] from the vindicated word and they build
[1:09:35] their own kingdoms but it's satan's
[1:09:37] kingdom and it'll come down because god
[1:09:41] has a way of building a kingdom
[1:09:44] that shall never be shaken we have
[1:09:47] received
[1:09:48] a kingdom
[1:09:50] [Music]
[1:09:51] that kingdom is the word of god that's
[1:09:54] god's way of giving you a kingdom is
[1:09:56] sending you the word and how can the
[1:09:58] word come unless it be a prophet and how
[1:10:01] can the prophet come unless god will
[1:10:03] send him and how shall we hear him
[1:10:05] unless god vindicates him but when a
[1:10:08] vindicated prophet comes amen behold the
[1:10:11] kingdom of god is naive
[1:10:14] [Music]
[1:10:16] even in thy mouth
[1:10:20] [Applause]
[1:10:22] this message has restored authority
[1:10:25] if thou shall say you went back to the
[1:10:28] garden of eden brother if you shall
[1:10:30] speak unto this mountain
[1:10:32] the message has elevated you back to a
[1:10:36] garden condition under the anointed word
[1:10:44] you know i'm telling you the truth you
[1:10:46] know the devil robbed you
[1:10:48] you know the devil robbed e
[1:10:50] the devil robbed adam and they fell
[1:10:54] now when they fell look that was a there
[1:10:56] was a tree in the garden
[1:11:01] in the book of genesis says
[1:11:05] god protected the tree
[1:11:08] lest
[1:11:09] adam want to reach forth his hand and
[1:11:12] took of the tree of life
[1:11:14] god protected the way
[1:11:17] to the tree of life
[1:11:19] he set guards around the way of the tree
[1:11:23] of life
[1:11:24] four guards
[1:11:25] one of them was an eagle
[1:11:31] but in the last days
[1:11:33] this eagle is not guarding the way
[1:11:36] he's pouring the way
[1:11:39] he's saying to the church the way has
[1:11:42] been restored
[1:11:45] all you've got to do is come this way
[1:11:48] and you'll walk back into everything
[1:11:50] that adam lost
[1:11:54] i've got all my shouting shoes
[1:11:58] [Applause]
[1:12:00] i'm not looking for the way god has
[1:12:02] provided the way
[1:12:04] to return to everything to every desire
[1:12:07] to everything you ever hope to be god
[1:12:10] has provided a way
[1:12:11] [Applause]
[1:12:13] what's paul what's paul saying in second
[1:12:14] corinthians 4. remember he said by this
[1:12:18] ministry
[1:12:19] god hath manifestly declared unto you
[1:12:22] by this ministry
[1:12:26] come on
[1:12:27] brother branham said i preached what
[1:12:28] paul preached
[1:12:32] william branham didn't just come
[1:12:34] preaching some doctrine but he
[1:12:36] manifestly declared
[1:12:39] the word of truth
[1:12:41] that restores the bride to the position
[1:12:45] that was lost in the garden we've been
[1:12:47] put back
[1:12:49] into paradise
[1:12:51] [Music]
[1:12:51] [Applause]
[1:12:56] it's the truth
[1:12:58] why does it say in revelation 22
[1:13:02] you you watch revelations 10 it's a
[1:13:04] powerful reading revelation 10 a mighty
[1:13:06] angel comes down out of heaven remember
[1:13:08] who that was
[1:13:09] christ
[1:13:12] the anointed one
[1:13:14] comes down out of heaven the messiah
[1:13:17] comes to the earth come on now
[1:13:19] but he has a book open in his hand
[1:13:22] and he's roaring as a lion roars and
[1:13:25] seven thunders are uttering their voices
[1:13:28] and you know what the bible said john
[1:13:30] said i wanted to write what i was
[1:13:32] hearing but he said john seal it up
[1:13:36] until
[1:13:38] until when
[1:13:40] until when
[1:13:42] god's got a way but it's going to be
[1:13:44] sealed up until until the seventh
[1:13:50] the seventh angel
[1:13:53] of revelations 10
[1:13:55] is the seventh angel of revelation 3 14.
[1:13:59] he's the messenger of the seventh age
[1:14:01] he's a man named william branham
[1:14:05] we are not looking for the seventh angel
[1:14:08] we are under his influence
[1:14:14] come on church y'all know i'm telling
[1:14:15] you the truth
[1:14:17] now look what happened when he sounded
[1:14:20] he released the word
[1:14:22] god's way
[1:14:23] of giving you anything
[1:14:25] is by faith
[1:14:29] that's true
[1:14:30] how can a man preach unless he be sent
[1:14:34] how can he do it but if he be sent he
[1:14:36] said how can a man call upon the name of
[1:14:39] the lord in whom he hasn't known
[1:14:41] but if he would have a preacher he would
[1:14:43] hear the preaching and then faith would
[1:14:46] bring by the hearing of the word of god
[1:14:48] everything god has for you will come
[1:14:51] through faith
[1:14:53] your healing is
[1:14:55] by faith
[1:14:56] your salvation comes through faith
[1:15:00] the word was preached you believed it
[1:15:02] and you received it
[1:15:05] you receive a kingdom
[1:15:08] look at this hey man he preached healing
[1:15:10] and you received it when he preaches the
[1:15:13] right sir
[1:15:16] we're not talking about just a healing
[1:15:17] ministry we're talking about a rapture
[1:15:20] ministry
[1:15:21] one that will change your body at the
[1:15:23] moment in the twinkling of an eye what
[1:15:25] was it the bible said it's oh my
[1:15:27] goodness something changed what was it
[1:15:29] when the bible said amen it said that
[1:15:31] they had a right
[1:15:33] now go to revelation 22 and watch john
[1:15:36] meet an angel
[1:15:38] john meets an angel and he's going to
[1:15:40] worship that angel you know what the
[1:15:42] angel said to him said don't worship me
[1:15:44] i'm one of the servants
[1:15:46] your brother
[1:15:48] a prophet
[1:15:49] a servant
[1:15:51] [Applause]
[1:15:54] don't you worship me
[1:15:58] don't you do that
[1:16:00] but he said to john
[1:16:02] unseal this book
[1:16:04] for the time of the prophecy is
[1:16:07] fulfilled
[1:16:09] the book would be sealed to win
[1:16:12] to the seventh angel
[1:16:14] and in revelation 22
[1:16:17] john is saying the angel said to me
[1:16:20] unseal the book

[1:24:00] it's a law of kinsmen
[1:24:04] i heard you out here talking about boaz
[1:24:06] it's a beautiful story
[1:24:09] ruth it's a beautiful story ruth amen
[1:24:11] found the right field
[1:24:14] at the right time
[1:24:17] and he said you are a virtuous woman
[1:24:23] who called you the virgin bride anyhow
[1:24:27] it wasn't just a servant it was the lord
[1:24:30] of the field that has come in this age
[1:24:38] he provided a way
[1:24:40] to take you from your harley tree and
[1:24:43] put you as a virgin in the scripture
[1:24:47] look at what look at what she did she
[1:24:49] worked in the right field brother
[1:24:51] it was the field of redemption it was
[1:24:53] the field that bo has amen
[1:25:00] she didn't come in just any time
[1:25:02] she didn't just come anytime she wanted
[1:25:06] she was representing you
[1:25:08] so she had to come at a certain season
[1:25:12] when she returned to israel it was
[1:25:14] harvest season
[1:25:17] it was barley season at that time
[1:25:26] in the field a little while
[1:25:27] and your confidence will get enough to
[1:25:30] come lay at his feet
[1:25:32] i just heard brother random on tape this
[1:25:33] morning he said she went back and asked
[1:25:36] naomi what's the way to be redeemed
[1:25:42] you know what brother adam said he said
[1:25:44] naomi was the old testament example that
[1:25:47] would teach you how to get redemption
[1:25:50] so she asked for an example and brother
[1:25:53] adam said the old testament is an
[1:25:55] example
[1:25:56] it holds the law of kinsmen
[1:26:00] if you go to the scripture it will tell
[1:26:02] you how to get redeemed god's way is a
[1:26:06] kinsmen redeemer
[1:26:07] [Applause]
[1:26:13] she got enough confidence from the
[1:26:14] example naomi until she said go lay at
[1:26:17] his feet in the harvest on the barley
[1:26:20] field go right there in the threshing
[1:26:22] floor when the judgments are going forth
[1:26:24] and the seed is being separated from the
[1:26:26] husk there's where the bride will come
[1:26:29] out there's where she will get rid of
[1:26:31] the husk he's on the threshing floor
[1:26:38] come on every wind of doctrine will come
[1:26:40] through
[1:26:42] but it'll never blow that pride
[1:26:45] because in harvest
[1:26:48] the life of the plant goes into the seed
[1:26:53] but it's not moisture it's oil
[1:26:56] the oil resides in the seed which gives
[1:26:59] its weight
[1:27:00] but it's not blown around it can hold
[1:27:03] its position in the middle of doctrines
[1:27:06] in the middle troubles it'll hold its
[1:27:08] place because there's oil
[1:27:13] everything in the plant goes into the
[1:27:15] seed
[1:27:16] all that was in luther is in this bride
[1:27:20] all that was in wesley's in this bride
[1:27:22] all that was in pentecost
[1:27:26] can i say it later all that was in god
[1:27:30] was poured into christ
[1:27:32] and all that was in christ has been
[1:27:35] poured into the seed word pride of jesus
[1:27:38] christ and in the hour of harvest she
[1:27:41] proves she's not a shock brother she's a
[1:27:44] seed to begin with
[1:27:51] harvest season
[1:27:53] seed separating from the shock
[1:27:55] all at the same time of the marriage of
[1:27:57] ruth
[1:28:00] [Music]
[1:28:01] she went and laid his feet
[1:28:03] the other man said that was confidence
[1:28:05] and heard that he could redeem her
[1:28:08] i tell you where my confidence is
[1:28:10] tonight
[1:28:11] it's in this kinsmen redeemer i don't
[1:28:13] have any confidence in the baptist or
[1:28:15] the lutheran or the wesleyans or the
[1:28:16] pentecostals i don't have any confidence
[1:28:18] in man but i have confidence in the
[1:28:21] quickening power of god in this age that
[1:28:24] he can raise a man up
[1:28:26] [Music]
[1:28:32] sure
[1:28:34] he could do it for her and god provided
[1:28:36] a way
[1:28:37] he said here's what you got to do
[1:28:38] you got to get his attention
[1:28:41] you know what the kinsmen had to do he
[1:28:43] had to go call the elders
[1:28:45] there was ten of them
[1:28:46] he had to call the elders you know what
[1:28:48] they knew they knew the law and they
[1:28:50] knew the prophets
[1:28:51] they knew what it took to make a kinsmen
[1:28:54] it took a certain law to be met they
[1:28:56] didn't get rid of the law
[1:28:58] somebody had to fulfill the law
[1:29:02] you're not getting rid of the law
[1:29:04] somebody fulfills the law
[1:29:06] [Applause]
[1:29:08] and boaz boaz went to his elders and
[1:29:11] they knew he had to be wealthy he had to
[1:29:13] be able to redeem he had to be kinsmen
[1:29:15] there was a list of laws he had to meet
[1:29:18] and what he done is he went before them
[1:29:20] and began to testify
[1:29:23] i am this woman's kinsmen
[1:29:25] i have the wealth to take her i have the
[1:29:28] ability to to give her seed
[1:29:30] i i can do this and the elders you know
[1:29:33] what they said
[1:29:35] you know what film elders said back
[1:29:38] worthy
[1:29:40] he's worthy
[1:29:42] boaz was worthy
[1:29:44] of redeeming ruth
[1:29:46] it was an act of redemption that
[1:29:49] redeemed her
[1:29:51] which was only a foretaste
[1:29:53] of revelations the fifth chapter
[1:29:56] when jesus our redeemer had to make an
[1:29:58] action of redemption
[1:30:01] he had already died for the church so he
[1:30:03] was rich in the blood but the names that
[1:30:06] was in that book amen was filthy and
[1:30:09] dirty and ungodly and not worthy of
[1:30:11] nothing but when he took the book he
[1:30:14] went before the elders
[1:30:16] 24 elders they knew the law and they
[1:30:19] knew the prophets and he held up the
[1:30:21] book of redemption that had you in it
[1:30:23] and he said they're my kinsmen
[1:30:28] they're mine
[1:30:29] they're all kin to me
[1:30:31] and i shed my blood for them
[1:30:36] and the bible said those 24 elders threw
[1:30:39] their crowns on the ground and said
[1:30:42] worthy is the lamb
[1:30:46] i say tonight worthy is the lamb of god
[1:30:50] to redeem us
[1:30:52] it's god's way of redeeming
[1:30:55] it's god's way of doing it brother you
[1:30:57] know what he did he made a testimony and
[1:31:00] then he tore the seals off of that book
[1:31:04] oh you know it's true he tore the seals
[1:31:07] off of that book and unsealed every
[1:31:10] redemptive right that was lost and was
[1:31:13] restored back to the church and
[1:31:16] under the ministry of elohim he restored
[1:31:19] everything back that we had lost
[1:31:22] [Applause]
[1:31:26] now y'all know i'm in the message strong
[1:31:28] right here brother branham said when he
[1:31:30] took that book he said the legal
[1:31:32] possession of that book meant
[1:31:35] it meant something it meant that god had
[1:31:38] restored everything that adam had lost
[1:31:43] i say to you tonight we are not a
[1:31:45] growing bride we are not a maturing
[1:31:48] pride we are not a coming pride we are a
[1:31:51] perfectly restored church by the power
[1:31:54] of god's provided way of doing it
[1:32:03] didn't he say shall be here didn't he
[1:32:05] say it was coming didn't he say there
[1:32:07] was a bribe would be on the earth from
[1:32:08] the last day didn't he say it
[1:32:11] he said my word cannot go out void but
[1:32:14] it shall accomplish
[1:32:19] [Applause]
[1:32:21] isaiah was a fallen man
[1:32:23] isaiah was born of a woman he was a
[1:32:25] fallen man
[1:32:28] brother brown said when he stood out to
[1:32:30] prophesy
[1:32:31] he should have come through eve by the
[1:32:34] spoken word isaiah should have
[1:32:36] been a spoken word child but fallen god
[1:32:40] got into him and prophesied his own
[1:32:42] redemption
[1:32:44] and said a virgin shall conceive
[1:32:47] well 700 years the word
[1:32:51] 700 years the word looked for a womb
[1:32:54] it looked for a womb to bring redemption
[1:32:57] through
[1:32:58] but when mary said
[1:33:00] be it unto me according to thy word
[1:33:03] she had abraham's seed right there
[1:33:08] now come on y'all know what i'm talking
[1:33:10] about i'm talking about a vindicated
[1:33:12] prophet today that is prophesied of an
[1:33:14] adopted church

[1:33:18] come into maturity and walk from this
[1:33:21] dimension to another
[1:33:24] that word will not return void
[1:33:28] the only way the word can go back to
[1:33:31] heaven is in flesh
[1:33:34] jesus said i come from god
[1:33:37] and i go back to god
[1:33:39] he came the word but he returned the
[1:33:42] word made flesh
[1:33:45] you came here as a spoken word seed
[1:33:48] bride

[1:40:25] he said romans 8 said all things work
[1:40:27] together for them that love god and are
[1:40:29] called according to his purpose he said
[1:40:31] then if god before you
[1:40:33] what can be against you you're a son of
[1:40:36] prosperity and it's time to tell that
[1:40:38] devil god made a way for me to prosper
[1:40:41] and i'm tired of you being
[1:40:46] is there somebody to hear me tonight i'm
[1:40:49] tired of living like this
[1:40:52] you can spiritually prosper tonight you
[1:40:54] don't have to be in depression and under
[1:40:57] anxiety god's made a way for you to fly
[1:40:59] like eagles
[1:41:02] come on you know what i'm saying you get
[1:41:05] so low sometimes you don't know what
[1:41:07] you're going to do but god called you an
[1:41:09] eagle
[1:41:11] he called you an eagle
[1:41:14] you know why he called you an eagle
[1:41:15] brother branham said he called you an
[1:41:17] eagle because
[1:41:18] an eagle is the only bird
[1:41:21] that can go all the way down
[1:41:23] and be renewed back again
[1:41:26] because god made a way for him to renew
[1:41:29] himself
[1:41:32] and god made a way for you to be renewed
[1:41:34] because you're an eagle you can get so
[1:41:37] low that you think i'll never rise again
[1:41:40] but god begins to speak and the bible
[1:41:43] says the eagle rises at his command
[1:41:47] well i've heard the call rise and shine
[1:41:50] thy light has come i feel the winds of
[1:41:53] redemption blowing across the church
[1:41:58] i say little eagle just spread your
[1:42:00] wings and you'll feel a lift
[1:42:05] it'll bring you higher
[1:42:10] i think it's time to tell that devil to
[1:42:12] go on
[1:42:18] god
[1:42:20] god
[1:42:21] is a waymaker
