kelly already covered me pretty good on that one so lord's willing we wait once everything is finished you get it amen so remember whatever you do in your graduation a reception or whatever remember to remain christian it will load you up with a lot of ammunition here so you're supposed to be the light of the world where do you go in the youth banquet or in a reception or whatever you do remember you don't want now to be reflecting something until the one looking at you will say i want to be like those young people i want to be like this young man amen don't be like saul who compromised to please the people you remember that sunday if you're trying to compromise everything to make sure you please certain people you can lose your ceiling everybody care so we don't want anybody to lose your ceiling make sure you stand on the word of god regardless of what is going on because your stand i was telling a young man i say stephen never knew that his stand on the word of god will affect the one of the greatest apostles that was sitting right there so you don't know if an earth paul paulie's right there watching you understand that you take on the word of god he's gonna save paul and paul will unfold the old testament and write the new testament amen so don't get caught up into everything dance wildly and all kinds of stuff and before you know it people are like which church do you go to is it really this is the church you go through and when they get on youtube they listen to me they're gonna see me firing every devil left and right now it's a confusion they're preaching like this look at the way they're living it's not compatible so remember rejoice rejoice in the lord be happy do everything good but remember somebody's watching you there is an eye watching you everybody here you're going to the youth banquet there is an eye watching you make sure whatever you do is pleasing unto the lord at the beginning you didn't know but now that you know god is going to require you according to the level of your understanding amen maybe those youth some of them never attended what we went through with you so you already know you don't want to they reflect what is going on and then they will be thirsting to be like you and you are preaching by your life amen did i help somebody whatever you do in word or indeed do it in the name of jesus christ and make sure everything is lined up amen blessed be the name of the lord so let's go to our scripture this morning roof chapter 1. we're getting into more deeper territory so make sure if you have time go home sit and play this back again amen amen i know myself because i get soaked myself into this and i know the two hours you get here you will soak soak soak until you go home you look you say i miss that one no you heard it but it was coming up a lot until you missed something so don't get the habit to listen and you know everything you memorize everything you just go out you don't remember and when they ask questions you don't remember amen i heard people saying wow and i'm like oh we already preached this in the church look at that she's acting like she doesn't remember what we were preaching amen luke chapter one verse eight if you're there you can say amen hallelujah and nahomi say to her two daughters this is not in judah this is in moab and naomi said to her two daughters-in-law go and return itch to her mother's house which is in moab the lord deal kindly with you as you have dealt with the dead and with me you might be seated if you quickly remember this both of them roof and orpah wanted to follow naomi amen and naomi discourage them and show them that there is no hope for them they are strange women and also that she only have two children her own husband passed away marlon and kylian died in other words i don't have any more child in other words i don't have any more husband to offer to you and even if you go with me to the land of judah even if i have a baby right now you're not going to be waiting for that baby for me to give it to in other words there is no option for marriage there is no option for marriage there is no option for husband everybody okay verse 9 the lord grants you that you may find what you may find rest the lord grants you that you may find rest where do you find the rest everybody okay okay but you may find the rest each of you in the house of here everybody okay if i get into marriage right now it's a trouble already everybody here marriage is supposed to be a house of rest for a woman not a house of trouble [Applause] i wish the whole church was here everybody so far so rest is connected to a husband everybody here he didn't say rest in the house of amen everybody okay anybody okay when they say husband it is already in a covenant anybody care in other words it speaks about a wedding already you are wedded you are hooked everybody okay so far so rest is connected to marriage anybody okay arrest is connected to a union anybody so to be a rest you must be united with somebody or you must be in marriage with somebody or you must have a husband you are sealed by a vow everybody okay so far so a house of marriage is not a house of trouble amen just one word you see what he does amen so if your house have trouble something is wrong come on let me leave it maybe we'll preach that down the road amen the lord gave you that you may find rest each of you in the house of her husband then she kissed them and they lift up their voice and wept everybody clear drop down to verse 22 hallelujah if you're there you can say a man so now me return and rub the moabites her daughter-in-law with her which returned out of the country of moab and they came to bethlehem in the beginning of barley water so the time that roof came into israel was a beginning come on offer harvest everybody we know there is two seasons everybody okay there is a sowing season everybody okay oh the plowing season everybody okay and there is also the harvest where we deal with the reapers bark here the sowing season if you remember have seed yes fully mature finished product you remember and the harvest also have seed ever care so whatever started here ending in the harvest so if you miss the sowing season you can get seed in the harvest hallelujah let's go to roof chapter three lord help us you understand ruth chapter 2 now you've seen the candlestick you see the reaper you've seen the messenger you've seen the table of the showbreath you've seen the all of them chapter 2 sanctification purification all of them now we're entering roof chapter 3. one book brother greg if you're there you can say amen then now me her mother-in-law say to her roof come on my daughter shall i not seek water everybody okay so the third chapter of roof because the mathematics of the bible are perfect open up with a discussion about rest i thought naomi said that there is no husband i'm asking you a question that's my way of preaching we're preaching together everybody here i thought naomi said there is no hope now homie say if you follow me there is no husband even if you check me i don't have any more babies no husband the one i have already dead there is no hope but where is this rest coming out this race could not be spoken into the land of moab if you're in moab nobody will say about this rest that's right you have to move into progression everybody when you are inside of israel then you will find the husband because remember boaz was a rich man very rich man anybody care so if naomi would have told them that in the promised land i have one of your family he is a single man have been talking with him on the telephone and i always ask him why he doesn't get married till now and he's still telling me that i'm i'm still praying i'm still praying i'm still praying and matter of fact he's a very successful businessman he owned big firm he has a multi-millionaire company do you think oppa would have gone back [Applause] she would have jumped on the wagon maybe she will be more louder than roof [Applause] maybe she will be the one working more if she was in the field she could be the one doing everything to impress boaz she worked she comes back she said boys did you see me today okay i want to make sure you saw me that rest is now revealed outside it is only kept over there we on sunday we have one service so let me gear slowly as we go amen hallelujah i told you one chapter one one verse amen i was trying to go even down but i can't i'm reading the second verse just to help you into something but really we'll stack on the first one verse two and now he's not bore us our water why she didn't say that in moab they won't tell you that anymore that's right god doesn't play a game anybody out here i gotta make sure before i do the ceiling i know where i'm putting that anybody care he's not boast of our kindred with who's made anyway everybody here behold he we knows barley tonight where does naomi knows all of this i thought she stayed home [Music] she even correct the roof when roof gave the wrong instructions he said no this is not what he said he told you to stay by the maiden how does she know this you got to read between the lines they didn't have no facebook they didn't have no whatsapp no instagram but the communication was flowing yes sister you pull it i'm going to say it you don't need a facebook for communication [Music] i'm trying to stay online everybody here do you know that when john the baptist when zachariah entered into the tower into the temple and spoke to gabriel when he came out was he able to speak he was out but they gave him the name of the child they told him the name of the child was who but when john was born the family came and they asked the question what is the name of this child do you know who answered do you know who answered he was not zechariah he was elizabeth [Music] zechariah was given a pepper to write to confirm [Music] everybody okay the one who gave the name was elizabeth was elizabeth in the temple how did she know the name of john how did elizabeth communicate with come on zechariah come on you don't need facebook everybody okay amen how do you look those that are married how do you look at the woman and the woman look at you and then she turn around and when you get married ask her the time that both of you struck your your two vision struck together something was spoken to her and from that time if you notice she avoids you [Music] do you know what i'm talking about i'm gonna leave it alone amen you know what i'm talking about as soon as she seen you something in here was like no more when you come she's uncomfortable she got a different language okay let me continue and now he's not bowers of her kingdom you will understand this with who's maiden why do you stay longer in the marriage and then you look at your wife and your wife knows what you're saying you don't need to be sitting and texting like it's time to go you know you're wasting time if he looks at you like this you will see the other one putting the baby's diaper back in place who told her park and you are looking at the same eyes and you keep talking that brother can we spend more time and you look at the same eyes and somebody's reading something else oh god we will learn this by and by i am by when the morning comes amen with whose maiden you were behold he he we knows bernie tonight how did you know that it's also tonight naomi who tells you who where is that fbi that cia that is working that intelligence that is between you and boaz you both are knowing something so roof is in the middle of something she doesn't understand the cooperation that is going on that's right amen amen behold he we knows barley tonight in the trashing floor do you know what a trashing floor is do you know what the churching floor is okay we will get to that later but i'm just going to give you a quick idea amen when the pick up the seed right back here the seed is covered with the shack all the shaft everybody here now the shaft was important in order to protect the seed everybody but once the seeds mature or the seed is fully fully grown we don't need the shark anymore so we need to remove the shack from the seed so we can keep the seed so you take that one into the threshing floor amen so the twitching for is a place where they separate the shack from the seed you okay and brother branham preach a message the seed shall not what with the it's a cherishing flow anybody here so the time this rest is spoken it's a rest that happened in the time of the separation of the seed from the shack did you get what i'm trying to say [Applause] anybody here this rest of naomi didn't happen at any time it happened first at the end of the harvest everybody because ruth came at the beginning of the harvest she worked all the way to the end everybody okay and after the end when it's time to separate the seed from the shack he have a certain rest open up so if you want to find this kind of rest it's a rest that even if you get in israel you won't see it yet you will only see it when it's time to take the seed in the threshing floor when it's the time of separation if you watch closely you will see a green light somewhere at the beginning of harvest naomi never spoke about the rest when roof was serving naomi never spoke about rest when roof finished serving and everything is finished and no more job when it's time to take the seed and to separate the seed from the shack we okay we okay [Music] let's go to hebrew chapter 3 blessed be the name of the lord you heard me telling you we go into deep territory right hallelujah the rest is connected to your husband is connected to a covenant it is connected to a wedding it is connected to a vow it is connected to a union it is connected to a marriage it happened on the third in the third chapter of roof not at the beginning but after the ending of the harvest at the threshing floor everybody okay hebrew chapter 3 verse 10 if you dare you can say amen or help me wherefore i was grieved with that generation and say they that generation do always air in there not in the head and they have not known my ways so our soul in my wrath they shall not enter into mine we okay now now everything is blending everybody okay take heed brethren let there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief so unbelief is an evil heart very bad in departing from the living god that word departing meaning turning away you cannot depart from something if you are not there already come on that's it anybody here if you turn away from something you were already in something and when you turn your back if you were in the message and you turn your back against the message it's an evil heart [Music] amen you are looking at the appearance but ezekiel told us what is inside everybody here but exhort one another daily while it is called today so there is a today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of what for we are made partaker of christ if we hold the beginning of our water steadfast in other words firmly to the water so the end you want to get in crushed if you hold it anybody care while it is said today if you will hear his voice harden not your heart as in the provocation rebellion for some when they had heard did provoke in other words they did rebel however not all that came out of egypt by moses not everybody but with whom was he grieved 40 years with whom did god was god really grieved for 40 years was he not with them that had seen whose carcass fell in the water and to whom so he that they should not what so arrest is not the way you think about resting it's something that you enter into did i help you you must find the door it's not the rest that oh i'm resting that's a different race that rest have a door and you open and you enter and you close the door [Music] everybody care my god and to whom sorry that he should not enter into his water but to him that belief no they departed from the message they never believed the message you thought they believed the message everybody here so we see that they could not enter in because of water which is an evil heart everybody okay jump to revelation chapter eight and then we see if we gonna pray right there or after amen in revelation chapter eight oh my god you the one slowing me at 25 miles i was going 45 so if you do good then i increase the speed amen if you're there you can say amen when he did water he did water is the seven seal open is it a problem come on now brother is it a problem so is the 7th sail closed open we're going to sit debating debating debating debating debating debating wasting time when he opened he had opened not the first not the second not the third i know where i'm going put your seatbelt stay alert it's a deep territory amen when he had opened the seventh seal which come after the six there was silence in heaven about the space of water so when the seventh seal opened it is quiet in other words it is mute it is silent everybody here the silence of the seven seal can only be broken by a vindicated prophet in revelation 10 the bible says in verse 1 and i saw another mighty angel came down from heaven everybody okay club with a cloud we know it's crust and a rainbow was upon his head crust and his face was as he wear the sun crust and his feet as water it is crushed that's right you have a difficulty see me we will sit and talk about here and this angel which is crushed he had a in his hand a little book that was what and we know if the book is open it means that the seals has been broken everybody okay because the book was sealed or closed with seven seals everybody okay so if the book is open somehow the seals are broken we have the first seal the second seal the third seal the fourth seal the fifth seal the sixth seal and the seven and back here and we know that the seven is the one that is outside everybody here and the one that is the inside the inner court of the book is the first seal everybody here and when they opened the first seal there was a thunder everybody cared so far so what do you expect when they open the seventh one [Applause] i'm going slowly we're talking about the seals being quiet that's why i told you i know which territory i am in everybody okay hallelujah he says he had in his hand another book that was water so if it's open that means that the seventh one is broken because the seven is wonder engage all the other seals but when you ask the seven he's quiet if you go ask the seven you say okay seven seal tell me who you are he's quiet he doesn't say anything he's looking at you and he look at you usually like this i know you know what i'm talking about if you need the coach you see me because what i'm saying when he entered the constellation the seventh angel was looking at him like this with his chest up like this and brother branham say all the other six they're familiar this is the one that from my entire life i was worrying about this one but when he's looking at brother branham he's just doing this what is going on hallelujah and he set his foot upon the sea and his right foot upon the sea because in the sea you know what happened in revelation 13. there is a beast that is coming up hey and his left foot upon the earth you know what happened the beast in america so he's blocking those two beasts so don't worry about them they're not going to do you anything anybody care don't worry about vatican don't worry about whatever happened in united states don't worry about it christ is blocking them because the bride is still there because boys taught the reaper do not touch roof do not touch roof make sure you don't abuse her [Applause] [Music] everybody okay so far did i lose anyone okay blessed be the name of the lord then this angel cried with the water as when the water so the cry i'm already in a sermon but we will pray let's pray that i get in because this is getting yummy heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love and your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father we are committing this service unto the hand may you come and minister to us may you move me completely out of the way may you be the alpha and the omega of this service we rebuke every demonic spirit contrary to your word away from this place come down father and bless your children in jesus precious name amen everybody here so when this angel come down this angel cries in other words there is a cry or a shout out [Applause] are we okay are we okay and that shout is like the roaring of a lion so the way he shout everybody here it's the the best analogy they can give you is that it is like a lion that is roaring what does it mean a lion that is roaring about here and when he cried what happened seven thunders other the voices so this shout is not like wow that's nothing here it is a shout that have a sequence of seven pandas so when he's roaring he goes like boo boo boo that that that's him so they shout contain seven thunders everybody here so these seven thunders when you put them together it is one shout out [Applause] you cannot have that shot with one candle because the time they are connected together you cannot pull one angel from here it is the seventh spirit of god but there are one spirit are we okay hallelujah he says and when the seven thunder has added their voices so these standards have voices it looks like i'm preaching the seals everybody okay when they ordered their voices i was about to do whatever so if he was about to write these standards are not natural thunderstorms [Music] it is standards that have messages [Music] and these messages are spoken first as a voice [Music] do you follow me when it's voice you can only record them [Applause] everybody okay after recording them then you can write them [Music] so you may have this standard as a recording how you can have them as a riding they are both the same everybody okay so far is the time that complicated are the sales complicated is the message complicated and we don't understand what the tunnel is 17-17 what is the seventh year [Applause] everybody okay so far so when these standard order their voices i was about to do what and i heard i heard a voice from water saying unto me to water okay so before john translate oh before john immorphy the thunders from voices into riding god block him everybody here here he said don't put the thunder in riding by the water seal their thunders or seal their voices everybody here so the thunders now are mute [Music] yes [Music] here the thunder spoke and john took a seal and pulled one two three four [Music] so if you go where's the thunders i saw the thunders here where are they you will see a seal jumping around if you touch that seal inside the seals there are seven thunders so the only way you can release the thunder you must break that seals if you break that seal he release the thunder as long as that seal is closed you will never understand or heal the thunders anymore right here so that's why when you get to that seal you ask him what is going on that seal is just looking at you [Music] that seal is quiet [Music] did you get it did you get it that's why the seven seal is silence because inside the seventh seal contain the pandas everybody okay so far did i lose anybody hallelujah he said sear up those things which the time they did water and do whatever when he cried he cried like a lion roaring what does it mean ryan rowing lord help me hallelujah in almost 3 verse 8. [Applause] is he complicated is he complicated is he complicated the scripture unfolding the scripture he said the lion has done whatever who will not water [Music] the lord god has what anybody here so the roaring of a lion is compared to the speech of god everybody must fear when the lord god has done what who can but what in other words when god speaks somebody must prophesy do you hear me god cannot speak without a prophet let me help you up again the speech of god that look like a lion roaring always require a prophet yes lion roareth the lord god has spoken who can but what not preach not sing when the lord god has spoken like a lion roaring he requires a prophetic gift to unfold what god has spoken everybody okay and in revelation 10 we found god speaking like a lion so who must speak on the earth a preacher a water that's why in revelation 10 7 he said bad but but it is still bad it is sealed but in other words even though it's sealed we got a way to decode and the way to decode is a prophet [Applause] everybody okay he said but in the days of what of the water [Applause] when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be water as he has declared to his servant the preachers the ministers the singer the water why prophet there [Music] everybody here so when god rolls or when god speaks like a lion automatically expect a prophet somewhere because the prophet is the only one that can decode the speech of god that look like a lion [Music] are you preaching the seals no my subject this morning is the four phases of roof the sabbath [Applause] are you ready to climb you ready to come okay let's leave the airport everybody here all right brother branham say as ask doc if he will tonight to put up my board there so that i shall be able to mark it out i don't want you to miss it now you got to study with me and study how so how do you expect to play with the message and understand anybody here oh you shall do it do you see how many people miss brother branham and put the people in confusion because they didn't take the time to sit down and study deep oh no we don't want deep things you don't need the deep things if you don't need the deep thing you are amen hallelujah i want to join that here on the board and then you bring your person and paper and write down this water this time and all about water what are you trying to say let's study together deeper when we look at the tabernacle with roof roof went to the present altar she made her decision and she moved from the present altar to deliver she accepted to die when naomi died to be buried over there and to be resurrected over there then she completed that part then she moved into the holy place where she was serving and serving over there roof have to complete her entire cycle of serving the bible says in roof chapter 2 verse 22 and naomi to roof her daughter-in-law it is good my daughter that that go out with his maiden in other words as you instruct him that the meat did not in any other water you must stay what where he told you to stay so she kept fast in other words she obeyed by the murders of boaz to glean onto their remember she came a day [Music] but now she's cleaning all the way to the water she's completing her entire circle of sanctification remember in the time of esther the purification was one year 12 months six months with men and six months with water you must complete the entire circle because sanctification will make way to the water once you reach the everybody here i'm gonna use three boxes everybody here this is your justification this is your sanctification and this is your baptism of the holy spirit as you traveling this way hey but here if you never made it here this door will not open back here you have to go all the way here then this door open and when you complete this one automatically this door will open everybody okay so far so roof she stayed until the end of barley harvest and off we have both harvard she completed all of them and she did what then it is important for a young woman to stay under gordon if she's not married thank you jesus can i help you up again roof was working for boys she had her salary she has her meal she has her paycheck she has her bank account but she never departed from her home anybody care so no matter how much she was making how much further she got with her supervisor roof always remained with her mother-in-law until the marriage [Applause] [Music] brother branham said and you women the devil just made that is what he did at the beginning and he certainly has made a target out of you he just does that because he knows what he can do he can deceive a woman a thousand times quicker than a man i know that hurt your feelings but it's water in other words stay with your parents even if you graduated from high school or you graduated from university if you're not married yet stay under legal guardian [Music] don't go out don't stay in the university you can get in trouble stay with your naomi until your husband come and get you [Music] the women that got pregnant in university they didn't go there to get pregnant but they never understood that environment they thought they could make it they thought they could stay themselves into an apartment before you know it you pregnant and you single mother thank you jesus because the devil can deceive you a thousand times more than he can deceive a man [Music] if your parent is not there stay with a legal guard yet do not stay in your own apartment [Applause] i'm having a paycheck i can leave my parent home i can go now live on my own you're putting yourself into the hand of the devil [Music] ever here even if you thirty-five you fought me your husband is not there stay there [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah my god that is exactly what he done in the garden she was honest she was sincere but she was water you didn't mean to do bad things no i'm just going to college i'm going to stay in the camera you know you know i mean on campus i'm not going for anything before you know it you find yourself in this claim in this claim in this club in this club in the wreck because you didn't know what the devil is doing go to campus when time is finished get in your car go back home [Music] everybody here stay under your parents everybody roof will get all this benefit but she dwell with her mother in law she never left her mother-in-law because there was an fbi that was working watching roof all the time every move how did boaz know that she didn't run after the young man everybody here how do you know that scripture right how did he know that ruth never talked to a young man so there was camera everywhere everybody here there is an eye watching you everywhere you must stop posting that because what stephen will see it somebody else who was there will record you and post it [Applause] and you get in trouble everybody okay so far everybody okay so far so roof staying under the instruction of naomi under a total obedience she knocked into that door and roof now is entering into the holiest which is roof until the holiest which we're talking today about roof the sabbath anybody okay so far when we look microscopically ezekiel explained to us because that was a macroscopic view now this is a microscopic view ever here macroscopic everybody look good micro and then you get into the heart then ezekiel say you must have a new heart you must have a new spirit or you must have the holy ghost everybody so we know that the door whether you are born in the message or not you must go by the cross because inside of you microscopically everything looks bad when you go through the cross the cross changes you completely and give you a new heart then you have completed the first step of ezekiel you got a new heart that happened inside outside nothing changes all we did we saw a brother here going back we don't know what happening to you so the brother must give us a testimony that he truly believed that he gave his love to jesus christ and that testimony is your water baptism which is an outward expression of something that has happened inside that's why when you go to the water it doesn't change you everybody okay it's only an outward expression on the heart you're still the same everybody here so now you get into the candlestick where you find the messenger and the messenger will give you the appropriate show bread for your day because you must be watched or purified by the washing of the word by the word everybody here so when you go over there the more you're going under the purification process leader by leader your atmosphere begins to change everybody okay as you continue to move toward the altar of the essence finally you're gonna change completely and you have completed the second stage of uh ezekiel which you get what a new spirit now the problem is getting into the holiest because over there this is where you get to the third step you get my spirit which is the holy ghost but we found out last sunday that the key to enter the holiest brother branham said was obedience brother bottom says this in reminding you that blessed the bible says blessed are day that do his coming amen that they may have a right to water so when you are doing the commandment of god you have a claim amen amen when you do what god tells you to do you have a right to put a claim on god and god is under obligation to give you what you want because you have done what he asked you to do what are you talking about brother madam say full obedience to the whole world of god entitle you to the talking and what obedience is important that's why move out some people want to apply the blood and stay in you apply the blood and kick all the trashes out of the house they didn't say the holy spirit will come and kick the treasures for you no you the one that pick up the trashes and put them outside everybody and have a house cleaning time you women take her dick take off the water not the holy spirit coming and taking your clothes off this is the roof in the legalistic way you must apply the word everybody okay you men throw away them cigarette and you women too get all this all stuff out of your system here that is called water purification sanctification what are you doing you're getting the world off of you ever here why because if you love the world all the things of the world is because the love of god is not even in you so when you are ready to apply the token empty up and get water you can serve god and mama at the same time you gotta reject one so that the other one can get you yes clean up the cardboard clean out this house we have a good old-fashioned house cleaning let the blood be water and then the token will be water applied the word and the holy ghost will come clean out and do what is it complicated everybody here brother branham said full of jesus to the world brings what full obesity to the whole world will entertain you to the water full obedience if this is obedience everybody care you cannot do obedience halfway you must go all the way to the end you cannot be half you cannot beat three quarters or whatever you must be whole ever here not at the part of it as far as your denomination goes this is what happened to the rich young ruler when he came in he proved to jesus christ that he already fully obey the commandment of god but here in other words i need eternal life jesus said well have you done the commandment yes i have completed them all and jesus gave him the last test like they gave to saul he said the last test is what take everything that you have sell them away come and do what if that young man would have done that he would have right to claim jesus christ all the way to the end but here but he refused the last test and he took him to hell everybody okay the sarah phoenician woman came and expressed her need jesus looked and gave a test because she followed jesus she was crying have mercy on me have mercy on me have mercy on me and finally jesus turn around and give the last test and say i cannot take what i have and give it to dogs anybody here either you swallow dog or you reject the dog ever care but she was humble enough to accept the position of a dog when she accepts she said okay if you call me dog and you want me to be dog then dog i am and matter of fact as a dog i still have a right to eat because i'm a dog brother branham said the dog is the only animal that must live with a man brother bonham said that's the reason why the white man understood that the african was a human being because they found him with a dog so they understood the dog must live by human so these are human everybody here so if you want me to be a dog thank god i am a dog but a dog eat what human eat [Music] ever here so i need what food did jesus ask her another thing no jesus told her to pray did jesus told her god to the priest in other words she in other words in other words she shut god's mouth up [Applause] she silenced god like doubts a there is nothing against you can tell me i have done what you require to me jesus turn around [Applause] go your child is everybody here why because she wanted to obey even if it cost her her reputation everybody okay so far so jesus says and say if you love me you will keep my word and my father we love him and we will come together and make our water and that world and that and that word love goes with the keeping of the what the commandment everybody here so why is this holiest here important why is he important you remember there was a road that was air on the road back here that road was laying somewhere everybody okay and they picked that road and they chose it to be like this is going to be my stick hey but here that road was dried and there was nothing to the road but here before aaron put his name upon the road that road also was a snake [Music] if you look at that it looks like a road yes ever here but when they put it on the ground in egypt it was not the road of moses it was the road of aaron that they threw down when they got into egypt into the world in a worldly environment ever here when they put that road in a worldly environment he manifested the snake that was inside [Applause] everybody okay aaron was driving with that rod never knew there was a snake in it anybody okay you are driving around never knew there is a snake in your heart [Music] it takes is another environment and before you know it you find yourself dancing like a wild man because the snake will come out [Applause] with a certain beat that's why you need to watch the christian song you are listening to it not a christian song a christian some of them are pure worldly songs if you take the name of jesus christ the entire bit is worthy and when they put jesus they get the brothers and the sister in before you know it the snake get comfortable enough and the snake is out and now we are offended how can a sister dance like this no it's a snake that got really really comfortable and the snake have to break it down all the way to the floor then we know there was a snake right there so when you start breaking it down on the pulpit or in your reception we know who's coming out [Applause] we know who's coming out because in the church the environment is different it shocked the snake so you must behave a certain way but let them put you in egypt and when the two magicians threw their snake and they exposed the snake the other one also was already jumping jesus everybody here somebody's dancing but you see the brother tapping the foot like this you say brother this is not a christian song i'm sorry the snake is tapping but here the snake is tapping and when they take a song they keep the beat they say jesus christ oh this is a christian song then he jumped but the way they are dancing look exactly like the world [Applause] it's a shame the kind of music message believers are listening to them and calling yourself message believer it's a shame some of them they took even those music and they post it without looking at that when we look we say no problem i understand the snake that is in there so the snake was inside the skull here everybody okay so far so keep your snake in everybody okay everybody okay hallelujah there was this road was road but it was a snake but here it was already justified they picked the road they were grounding i mean they took the road they were using it only on the justification state anybody but one day the time came that they say we must take the road and we must prove he was not proving the road they were proving the high priest here that was the owner of the road everybody here so the vindication of the high priest required the name of the high priest to move from the high priest and to good place on the road and we have our own high priest his name is who jesus and when you take on the name of jesus christ here when they took that road and they took that road inside the holes the road burden [Music] everybody okay then he blossomed then he produces water [Music] and work here and god said to moses take that road away from aaron but here he cannot be managed by men anymore anybody here take that road open the ark of the covenant ever here and take that road and put it inside the ark and close it there in the presence the snake will never happen again you will never see the snake again the presence in egypt opened up the snake but the presence in the holiest did no longer reveal the snake but it revealed the identity that was hidden in the road ever here he was no more a snake that can swallow he was no more a snake that can bite he was no more a snake that would scare somebody but now it's hormone if i'm hungry now i can eat some fruit so if you want your life [Music] but here to stop exhibiting the snake you must enter into the holiest because the holiest will first stop the snake clean up the snake burn the snake and produce what you really are what god really sent you to do on this earth will begin to come up later by luna you're gonna blossom you're gonna bad and you want to produce fruit and the fruit of the spirit are love joy long suffering all of them will come [Applause] only when you enter in the holiest any question so far if it's important getting into the holiest our discussion up and up in ruth chapter 3. i'm good on time in roof chapter 3 ruth completed her circle she finished her harvest she did everything full obedience to what power say bro i said stay in the field nobody's seen her anywhere boys say you must stay by the medal she stayed by the medal all the way to the end of the office all the way to the end of the office the shift finish the department close roof goes home and sit down everybody completed full obedience and naomi looked you can turn that on whoever was on the wall naomi look yes naomi looked and when naomi looked he said my daughter come on up here i want to see you come up here and then they came don't worry about the light somebody would take care of it amen he said my daughter come up here he came sit down sat down in other words i have watched you i have seen if somebody can stay away from the wall i have watched you i have seen you i have understood everything now i know for sure that you are jew please so since i know that you are a jew i'm gonna break to you something down sit down roof may be scared did i do something wrong no don't worry sit down she sat down and naomi opened up a new subject that she never opened she's the guardian to israel and the new subject that naomi open was the subject of rest follow me carefully and this rest is not just resting from a basketball game it is now resting from coming from work it is not resting because you want and you play a soccer it was not that kind of rest it is a rest that is connected with love [Music] it is arrested that concern a husband a race that concerns a union a race that concerns a marriage a vow a covenant a wedding ever here and that rest happened in the chapter in chapter three the word rest in the bible is called in the bible terminology in the greek the sabbath everybody okay what is a sabbath what is a rest means a day of rest that is what the old sabbath was a day of what so when you see rest it means what so when naomi say my daughter i must find rest what naomi was saying roof i must find a sabbath because roof was working and when she finished working she was going home to rest that was not the rest naomi was talking about edward because that one roof could have at any time she wanted matter of fact at mealtime boasts told the roof that if you want to rest and go eat go eat that's not the rest but this is a different restaurant it is the rest of the sabbath amen everybody here in other words my daughter i see you but it damn deep inside of you you are still agitated you are still babbling everybody here i want to quieten whatever is inside and make an end to that everybody here brother random say when you see rest in the bible it means sabbath look it up in your original manuscript if you happen to have a greek bubble and find out if the word if you got a scofield bubble look at the marginal reading on rest and see if it don't bring you right back to sabbath sabbath means water that's why roof today is this sabbath what is going on with the sabbath brother branham where we are where are those scriptures in exodus chapter 16 verse 23 the bible says and he say unto them this is that which the lord has said tomorrow is the water after so sabbath and rest are both of them connected lord help me so when we say sabbath in the scripture you cannot have a sabbath without rest everybody if you say rest or you say sabbath both of them are the same thing roof under the sabbath exodus 31st the bible say six days may work be done sorry i need this one six days may the work be done the day of the week first day second day third day fourth day sixth day a fifth day sixth day you can work accordingly everybody okay everybody okay you need to stay alert everybody here sixth day work may be done but in the water [Music] so the seventh day was the sabbath all the water hallelujah the seventh is the sabbath of rest holy to the lord whosoever does any work in the sabbath day he subbitually put you up no work go to your work on monday go to your work on tuesday go to your work on thursday all the way to saturday on the service remove everything don't work if you work they kill you why because the seventh was a day god say go home and rest what is going on roof resting brother bonham say seven which is the number of the sabbath everybody okay which is the number of the rest brother branham say this number seven is a number of completion everybody here so when you are building something and you finish it the proof that you have finished what you're doing you take number seven and you put it you follow me so when somebody is examining your work if they see number three you're not done yet if they see number six you're not done yet if they see number seven on you finish you don't have to be there come on only this way everybody okay brother madam says 7 is the number of completion and 3 is the number of what we know that 3 is the number of perfection and brother branham opened here he said three is also the number of water now you understand when they say the brazen altar was five by three grace to bring you into perfection because you want to have life everybody okay so far now brother branham say true means life and seven means completion what does seven have to do with three everybody okay lord help me brother bottom say seven is the number of completion and this gives the complete what brother branham is saying that sabbath is number seven but sabbath is also connected to three and three give a complete sabbath what does it mean everybody okay so far what does it mean my brother i need this face here because we're going to use it everybody here what does it mean in the scripture there are three sabbaths follow me carefully the first sabbath is the sabbath of god everybody okay everybody okay the second sabbath is the sabbath that was given to israel in other words there are three sabbaths or three rest in the bible the first rest was the rest that belongs to god himself everybody okay the second rest belongs to israel and this rest that belonged to israel affected the human being he affected the animal domestic he affected the land and nature i'm going slowly shake somebody's hand and tell him wake up everybody okay everybody okay the third sabbath is the sabbath of the church where do you get this stuff brother branham says this that that was the third rest he gave the first god receive it from his work can you say amen the second israel received in the law the third the church received it as a part of what so the second rest is connected to the law and what do you expect the third to be corrected with you yes everybody okay so far brother branham say three is the number of what every time you see three it is what roof chapter three rest is speak of water notice when god created the earth on the third day was what the third day they came life on the third day of what if you read or you listen to brother branham like a parrot you will miss something right here anybody here you will only say brother branham say number three is life number three is life but you're missing something brother branham not only is he telling you what number three is but brother branham is showing you the method that he used to decode number three in the scripture do you see in other words the numerology of brother branham comes by the bible verses if you understand that you can trust any any numbers now in the bible that's why brother brother said four is the number of deliverance and he gave the example look at the four hebrew when he was in the fire what happened you see what i'm saying so you need to learn not on you need to read the message between the line and once brother branham gives you a key you can take that key and unlock every number in the scripture [Music] i'm not in numerology but i'm talking about something everybody here so through sabbath the first sabbath is god the second sabbath is israel the third sabbath is for the church this is what brother branham say where is that in the bible take hebrew chapter 4 in this church the bible says because the message and the bible are amen so if somebody tells you brother brother is contradicting the scripture they don't know what they're talking about you don't play with a vindicated prophet anybody here hebrew chapter 4 if you dare you can say amen i'm good on time i'm just way down there in the deep with one service on sunday you eat you get dessert you go home you're good so don't complain oh no we have two services after he preached three out no no no no no one so you divided by two 150 150. 1.5 1.5 go home everybody okay seven cosby one it takes care of the day everybody okay no complain hebrew chapter four it's a sense of humor body to just relaxes the spiritual muscles so you can soak this in you ready let us therefore do what in other words be careful lest a promise be left as of entering it remember on chapter three they missed it because of unbelief everybody care now we're on chapter four lest a promise be left us of entering into his what it's an it's a rest that you enter any of you should seems to come water in other words paul is saying be careful if there is any promise that is left for us to experience the rest of god we don't want any one of you to miss it anybody okay we want to see the three rest anybody okay for to us was the gospel preached as well as to them israel okay but the word preached did not profit the jews he didn't profit them not being mixed with what in them that did what that's why you can hear the message if the message was never revealed to you you won't get it after 20 years you can depart that's right because you never have a revelation of it oh he was a good brother he was a brother good but he didn't have the revelation everybody care verse three for we which have believed do what so the correct way that shows that you have believed god you must enter into the sabbath that's right what is the sabbath what is the rest ever here as he said as i have sown in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the work were finished from the foundation of the water so now paul is taking us back in eternity he says in eternity the work was already finished but we know that the lamb of god was slain before the foundation of the world so the rest was already existing somewhere anybody care but now we want to see that rest in god in israel and in the church but paul is already saying that israel god told them you cannot enter into my rest so there was a rest given to israel and paul said be careful if there is another rest for us we don't want you to miss so now you have the rest of israel and the rest of the church we're going slowly anybody okay verse 4 for he spoke in a certain place of the world on this wise and god rested the water from all his water [Music] so god worked and god also entered into his west so there is a rest of [Applause] god and there is the rest of israel and some people miss it to enter to the promised land and paul said be careful if there is a rest of the church pre-rest did brother branham give you the scripture today let's continue ever here and watch verse 4 for he spoke in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise and god did rest the seventh day from all his water which rest is that one the rest of who the rest of god watch verse six verse five and in this place again if they shall enter into mine which rest now the second rest everybody okay everybody okay verse six sin therefore eerie man which rest is that now [Music] which race is that now brother we preach the bible [Applause] if there are people that should preach this bible is the people that believe the message [Applause] [Music] [Applause] a message believer your territory is the bible when you talk to somebody join to the bible if he put his foot on the bible don't take him by the court [Music] pull him by the bible but behind you there is the coat [Music] you hook him by the bible you hook him by the bible you hook him by the bible until he got he's locked he's locked he's locked he's locked he's like he can't move he open his mouth and you pull the message and you put in it [Music] i made jehovah witness run away and they don't come to me anybody here i don't have a quote with me i just say open the bible we just talk one and that's it never engage again everybody here verse six seeing therefore it remains that some must enter the ring and the d and they to whom it was first preached enter not because of what again after the three verse seven number seven number seven verse seven number seven the number of sabbath the number of rest the number of completion everybody okay now again he limits a water a new sabbath saying in who notice i am now israel gathered through moses now it's david speaking and david was the one who was a king but enter into the tabernacle and took the showbread and eat it and nothing happened because he was under the lineage of melchizedek everybody okay so that rest goes with a certain priesthood [Applause] but here because that's the first rest was under the law under aaron priesthood or leviticus priesthood but this one is the rest of the melchizedek did i lose anybody let's go verse seven again he limited a certain day saying in death not in moses everybody here today after so long a time after the time of israel as it is said today if you will hear his voice heard not your what if he for if jesus do you know who this this jesus let me let you read it yourself because you're going to say brother stephen say for if jesus had given them rest he's talking about the jews was jesus with the jew remember moses came and moses was never able to take israel to the promised land you remember it was who took them to the promised land it was joshua the name joshua in hebrew means jesus amen amen brother branham said jehosha yoshua messiah your sure jesus christ your sure is the name of jesus in hebrew that's why you heard the hebrew calling jesus yeshua [Music] everybody here it's the name of jesus in hebrew that's all if it is in english it is what means you sure joshua yoshua is just the same thing so because they took this bible into english that's why they translated as jesus but it means joshua if you look at a different translation it will tell you it was joshua anybody okay so let's go back to verse 8 for if joshua jesus had given them rest if joshua entering with them in the promised land gave them rest so why if joshua gave them rest everybody okay then would he not after lord have spoken of another in other words if joshua completed the rest they could never be given another rest but even though joshua gave them rest by putting them in the promised land yet god give another rest [Music] so how many words do we have verse nine dare remain there for a while for who everybody okay god rested there seventh day israel got a rest through moses and joshua completed it by putting them into the promised land and now we have another rest for the people of water the church of god how many rest let's get it here so he that is entered into his the rest of who everybody okay he's rest not your rest you have to enter into his rest okay buddy okay he also have seas
