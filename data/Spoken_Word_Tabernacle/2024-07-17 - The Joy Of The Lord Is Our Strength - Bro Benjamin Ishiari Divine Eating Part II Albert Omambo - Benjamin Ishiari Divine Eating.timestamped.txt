[52:04] the first scripture
[52:06] that I wanted to read today was
[52:08] Revelation
[52:21] 66 am
[52:28] and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the
[52:31] four Beast say a measure of wheat for a
[52:35] penny and three measures of barley for a
[52:38] penny and see thou hurt not the oil and
[52:41] the wine amen my second scripture I
[52:44] wanted to read was act
[52:48] 16 verses 25 through 26
[52:58] you say
[53:00] amen and that midnight Paul and Silas
[53:04] prayed and sang Praises unto God and the
[53:08] prisoners heard
[53:09] them and suddenly there was a great
[53:12] earthquake so that the foundations of
[53:14] the prison were shaken yes sir and
[53:17] immediately all the doors were open and
[53:19] everyone's hands bands were loosed yes
[53:24] sir in the last SC want to read is
[53:28] Nehemiah 8 verse
[53:33] 10 you there say
[53:37] Amen then he said unto them go your way
[53:41] eat the fat and drink the sweet and send
[53:44] portions unto them from whom nothing is
[53:47] prepared for this day is Holy unto our
[53:50] Lord neither be ye sorry for the joy of
[53:53] the Lord is your strengthen amen
[53:57] so that's my title for today the joy of
[54:00] the Lord is our
[54:02] strength see when I was meditating on
[54:06] this I was thinking se you may be seated
[54:10] I was thinking
[54:13] um sometimes we don't really understand
[54:19] God sometimes we think of our life as
[54:22] like a fairy tale or something that oh
[54:24] every time it has to be happy if if it's
[54:26] sunny outside I'm I'm happy if it's
[54:29] raining I'm not
[54:31] happy so but when you really get higher
[54:35] with God yes sir when you get into a
[54:40] revelation yes sir we're going into the
[54:42] back part of God's mind right
[54:44] now the part that confuses the devil
[54:47] Hallelujah
[54:57] if we go to um where with Paul and Silas
[55:01] oh no let's start with um Revelation
[55:05] 6 but the brandom said the
[55:08] oil is the Holy Ghost I'm paraphrasing
[55:11] I'm going to read the quotes we know the
[55:13] oil is the Holy Ghost and the wine is
[55:15] the stimulation of
[55:16] Revelation so in the third seal um
[55:20] paragraph
[55:21] 305 now oil the third SE yeah 63
[55:27] now oil symbolizes the spirit the Holy
[55:32] Spirit I'll give you a few verses if you
[55:34] want to I
[55:35] won't and the next one the third seal
[55:39] 306 and wine symb symbolizes stimulation
[55:43] of
[55:44] Revelation so we read
[55:47] that in when God put the people in that
[55:50] age through
[55:52] turmoil now us as carnal beings we look
[55:55] at it as like we would look at it oh why
[55:56] did God put us through
[56:01] this we live in a world
[56:04] where if you don't know if you don't
[56:06] really know much things happen things
[56:08] bad happen in this life sometimes it
[56:11] blows your mind like how could this even
[56:12] happen how could God even how can God
[56:14] even allow this thing to
[56:16] happen but amongst all those
[56:20] things touch not the oil and the wine
[56:24] [Music]
[56:25] [Applause]
[56:29] God touch not the oil and the
[56:32] wine what is the mystery behind this oil
[56:35] and this
[56:36] [Applause]
[56:42] wine and my title for today is the joy
[56:45] of the Lord is our
[56:49] strength so what is the stimulation oh
[56:52] oh oh I'm get oh we said I already read
[56:53] the one symbolizes the stimulation right
[56:56] so what is the stimulation we he that
[56:58] the stimulation of
[57:00] Revelation so is
[57:04] it it
[57:06] maybe is it
[57:09] just it maybe but what really is this
[57:13] stimulation what stimulates
[57:16] [Applause]
[57:21] us for the brandom says in the third
[57:25] seal chap on paragraph
[57:27] 308 when the truth of a promised word of
[57:30] God has been truly revealed to his
[57:36] Saints that's filled with oil they all
[57:39] get
[57:42] stimulated wine is a
[57:45] stimulation look what he says Glory I
[57:48] feel it right now stimulated with
[57:51] [Applause]
[57:52] [Music]
[57:53] [Applause]
[57:54] joy so it's not a stimulation of just
[57:57] playing
[57:59] [Applause]
[58:02] around it's a stimulation of
[58:06] joy and joy connects with the
[58:09] [Applause]
[58:20] Revelation Lord
[58:22] help Lord help me
[58:27] so Joy connects with the Revelation so
[58:29] no
[58:32] [Applause]
[58:46] Revelation he says in another um the
[58:49] same the same
[58:51] um the same
[58:56] same message on the third seal paragraph
[59:00] 318 they become so stimulated over the
[59:04] Revelation that they Vindicated all
[59:07] right the promise yes sir now oh now oh
[59:10] M there broke out the joy of
[59:15] stimulation till the people said they're
[59:17] drunk on new
[59:21] wine so when the people of God were in
[59:24] shackles
[59:26] I forgot what age that was specifically
[59:28] that I read from I
[59:30] don't the Dark Ages uhhuh when the
[59:33] people of God were in shackles when apus
[59:36] and silus were bound
[59:37] [Music]
[59:40] up it confuses the devil
[59:48] completely it looks like how I have
[59:50] these people Locked In
[59:52] Chains the chains of sin the chains of
[59:55] lust
[59:58] but all of a sudden the devil just sees
[1:00:00] they're out of it
[1:00:02] now what could what could be in a
[1:00:04] religion that take people away from the
[1:00:06] lust of this flesh what could be in a oh
[1:00:10] just come to church St glass
[1:00:13] windows what could be in a a religion in
[1:00:16] a church that takes people from from sin
[1:00:19] and brings them to God they have to see
[1:00:22] the joy of the
[1:00:24] Lord they have not see they have to feel
[1:00:28] they have to feel the joy of the
[1:00:30] [Applause]
[1:00:32] [Music]
[1:00:32] [Applause]
[1:00:35] Lord which is given by
[1:00:38] Revelation so when they receive a
[1:00:41] revelation they automatically receive
[1:00:43] [Applause]
[1:00:47] Joy if you don't if you don't receive
[1:00:50] that Revelation you'll you'll go back to
[1:00:56] brother brandom even said um when that
[1:00:58] was in the up um he he dramatized in the
[1:01:02] um in this message through the third
[1:01:03] sale yes he said if there was in the
[1:01:05] upper room and they thought
[1:01:08] oh we've been here for a few days
[1:01:12] now we must have already got
[1:01:15] it you know let's just go out and preach
[1:01:18] our our sermon let's he said it like
[1:01:20] that let's just go out and preach our
[1:01:21] seron we we've got it we've been here
[1:01:23] praise the Lord Jesus
[1:01:27] uh I give I give him two
[1:01:34] days you have to wait till the
[1:01:37] stimulation comes till the Revelation
[1:01:41] comes and the joy of the Lord is our
[1:01:44] strength so they that wait on the Lord
[1:01:47] shall renew their
[1:01:49] [Applause]
[1:01:54] strength how do they renew their
[1:01:57] strength by waiting how could waiting
[1:01:59] renew your
[1:02:00] [Applause]
[1:02:07] strength waiting on the Lord renews your
[1:02:10] [Applause]
[1:02:11] [Music]
[1:02:12] strength so what happened between that
[1:02:14] span of time
[1:02:16] [Applause]
[1:02:20] of they shall even run and not grow
[1:02:22] weary
[1:02:29] that's what Joy does to
[1:02:31] [Applause]
[1:02:33] you the ones that wait shall renew their
[1:02:37] strength and they shall even run and not
[1:02:39] grow
[1:02:41] weary so what's what's what's
[1:02:43] stimulating that running and not going
[1:02:45] weary it's the joy of the
[1:02:47] [Music]
[1:02:48] Lord because when God came when you were
[1:02:51] waiting when you were in patience I'm
[1:02:54] perfecting your faith cuz patience
[1:02:57] what yes sir patience perfects your
[1:03:01] faith so that's why that's why we must
[1:03:04] be
[1:03:06] patient that's why that's why it's not a
[1:03:13] picnic God God knows us better than we
[1:03:16] know
[1:03:18] ourselves what we think is good for us
[1:03:20] but we think will
[1:03:22] work when the little kid gets mad and
[1:03:25] he's throwing like how we said he's
[1:03:27] throwing a temper
[1:03:28] tantrum what we think that what the
[1:03:31] gentle parenting what you think will
[1:03:33] work oh give from the candy and then he
[1:03:34] keeps on doing that until we grow that's
[1:03:36] not how God
[1:03:38] works even if he so even if we God does
[1:03:41] what we think he should do for us it
[1:03:43] will not help
[1:03:46] you so we should we should be thankful
[1:03:49] for the whoopings
[1:03:51] [Applause]
[1:04:01] the Lord chastised and and rebukes those
[1:04:04] that he
[1:04:09] loves the joy of the
[1:04:12] Lord joy of the
[1:04:15] Lord in the um in the third
[1:04:18] seal paragraph 314 uhhuh so you see wine
[1:04:22] represents stimulation of Revelation
[1:04:25] that's right and when the Holy Ghost
[1:04:27] fell yes sir and they seen the fire of
[1:04:29] God fall upon them yes sir my that begin
[1:04:33] to stimulate them right and the first
[1:04:35] thing you know they got so stimulated to
[1:04:38] the people actually thought they were
[1:04:41] drunk but they were stimulated by the
[1:04:44] Revelation by God's here it is God's
[1:04:46] Vindicated Revelation made plain to them
[1:04:50] no no sorry made it plain to them they
[1:04:52] was happy about it
[1:04:59] God promised it here it was revealed to
[1:05:02] them and Vindicated to them amen here
[1:05:05] was a man here saying this is that this
[1:05:08] is that and there it was being
[1:05:10] Vindicated by the same sign that we have
[1:05:12] today there is stimulation by
[1:05:16] [Music]
[1:05:21] Revelation Joy cannot be faked
[1:05:24] [Applause]
[1:05:34] with Paul and
[1:05:36] Silas they were in a prison
[1:05:39] house and there were other people in
[1:05:42] that prison house with them that were
[1:05:43] not
[1:05:46] Believers so they're already at they're
[1:05:48] at the lowest of the
[1:05:50] lows their s their sin took them to the
[1:05:53] prison house
[1:05:56] [Music]
[1:05:58] the things of this world LED them to
[1:05:59] that prison
[1:06:02] [Applause]
[1:06:03] house the only way you can really get
[1:06:07] somebody to thirst for what you believe
[1:06:08] if they see it that it's
[1:06:10] [Applause]
[1:06:16] real when they were when they were at
[1:06:18] their
[1:06:20] lowest and they they had anything but
[1:06:24] Faith but they hear Paul and
[1:06:28] [Applause]
[1:06:29] silence cuz remember God opened the
[1:06:32] doors for them too it just said that
[1:06:35] they
[1:06:36] heard so what did it do to them when
[1:06:41] they it must have done
[1:06:43] [Applause]
[1:06:45] something it must have done
[1:06:51] something it stirred up something in
[1:06:53] them to
[1:06:58] and God opened the doors for all of
[1:07:01] them so now they have something
[1:07:04] different that's it now they heard they
[1:07:07] heard something real this
[1:07:09] time because in this world that we we
[1:07:12] have now we already in a Christian
[1:07:15] Nation so the the the Christianity will
[1:07:18] not work the faith it will not work
[1:07:22] [Music]
[1:07:23] [Applause]
[1:07:33] oh I go I go to church we have Bible
[1:07:35] study every
[1:07:37] Wednesday me me
[1:07:44] too they have to see
[1:07:47] something and they have to know that is
[1:07:51] real even in the
[1:07:53] message that's it
[1:07:56] it's nothing that you do it's the
[1:07:57] stimulation of revulation gives you Joy
[1:08:01] it renews your strength so when you're
[1:08:03] in the prison and you're clapping when
[1:08:05] your strength is renewed they see
[1:08:08] [Applause]
[1:08:21] that oh Lord God
[1:08:28] Lord Lord heavenly
[1:08:32] father they that wait upon the Lord yes
[1:08:35] brother shall renew their strength
[1:08:38] yes and brother and if I could zoom in
[1:08:42] on that same one that same quote I read
[1:08:44] and it said and the first thing you know
[1:08:47] they got so stimulated till the people
[1:08:50] actually thought that they were
[1:08:54] drunk and
[1:08:56] um in the same SC in the same in the
[1:08:58] same message he says that it made them
[1:09:02] act as if a drunk person would
[1:09:08] act so with the people in the world that
[1:09:12] some people especially religious people
[1:09:15] if you're going there with not without
[1:09:17] real real Revelation that was trouble
[1:09:19] you they have a type of anchor in what
[1:09:22] they
[1:09:23] do they will never compromise for what
[1:09:25] they
[1:09:26] do it could be drinking it could be just
[1:09:30] random anything but they're firm about
[1:09:33] it cuz it's in
[1:09:36] them so if you come in with a with a um
[1:09:40] a
[1:09:41] coat that that's not really in you it's
[1:09:44] on
[1:09:45] [Applause]
[1:09:46] you just them Simply Having the strength
[1:09:50] that will automat you automatically will
[1:09:52] lose just their persistence and just
[1:09:54] they really believe what they do is
[1:09:56] right and you not really sure just that
[1:09:58] alone you already
[1:10:04] lost they say Real Recognize is
[1:10:08] [Applause]
[1:10:10] real so so it made these people act as
[1:10:14] if they were
[1:10:16] drunk so the stimulation is so
[1:10:21] deep The Sinner is even looking like are
[1:10:24] they drunk
[1:10:26] so it's the it's the opposite what I'm
[1:10:28] trying to say
[1:10:30] is the word of God the revelation of God
[1:10:33] does not put a religious spirit on
[1:10:38] you because the religious spirit was the
[1:10:41] FES when they saw Jesus eating with the
[1:10:44] Sinners they said why is this man eating
[1:10:47] with
[1:10:49] Sinners Jesus would rather eat with the
[1:10:54] sinners than eat with the
[1:10:57] Pharisees I'd rather you be
[1:11:01] cold because the because the Sinners
[1:11:05] they they they they be chilling man they
[1:11:06] don't care they just
[1:11:08] chilling the church betrayed Jesus it
[1:11:10] wasn't it wasn't at the
[1:11:12] center that
[1:11:21] was that's why he said he's crucified on
[1:11:24] the PO he's not crucified out there in
[1:11:26] the
[1:11:28] [Applause]
[1:11:35] world so the so the nonchalantness of
[1:11:39] The
[1:11:39] Sinner the one he's just chilling man he
[1:11:42] don't got no put on man he
[1:11:48] yeah that's why a true Son of God I know
[1:11:51] you you all experienced this when you
[1:11:52] when you speak with a a sinner it's
[1:11:55] different because sometimes they they've
[1:11:57] heard this before they've heard this
[1:11:58] before but man I I like you brother
[1:12:01] Charles I like you just I don't know I
[1:12:03] just like your um your um different
[1:12:05] you're you're
[1:12:07] different it's the same
[1:12:09] religion this but it's something
[1:12:11] different inside that's
[1:12:18] real so until they see something real
[1:12:21] until that until they see something real
[1:12:23] until they they see something real they
[1:12:25] follow they don't understand but they
[1:12:26] just they just love this
[1:12:33] [Applause]
[1:12:36] presence a great
[1:12:40] atmosphere they will continue with you
[1:12:42] and then they start they just start
[1:12:43] dropping certain
[1:12:46] things they start they start doing
[1:12:49] things that they never expected them to
[1:12:50] do
[1:12:52] before they start thinking things that
[1:12:55] and they're learning it from a you a
[1:12:57] real
[1:12:59] believer because they see that this man
[1:13:02] is not faking it I can talk with this
[1:13:05] man I can reason with this man he has
[1:13:07] wisdom he knows how to divide the word
[1:13:10] cuz if you a hypocrite oh you just
[1:13:13] rebuke rebuke rebuke rebuke all the
[1:13:16] time and it's not led by the
[1:13:18] [Applause]
[1:13:22] spirit I said the O Brother BR said the
[1:13:24] oil was the Holy
[1:13:27] Ghost and the sons of God are led by the
[1:13:30] spirit of
[1:13:34] God the sons of God are not controlled
[1:13:38] by the spirit of God they are led by the
[1:13:41] spirit of
[1:13:44] God this is all going back to the things
[1:13:46] you can't control the the oil and the
[1:13:50] wine so until you get that stimulation
[1:13:53] of Revelation the Holy Ghost
[1:13:55] [Music]
[1:13:56] you can't really be like Jesus you can't
[1:13:58] really spread Jesus in this
[1:14:01] world because because they won't see the
[1:14:06] joy they see these people are
[1:14:09] [Applause]
[1:14:13] miserable that's why I said that's why
[1:14:16] the sinner is confident and the
[1:14:17] Christian
[1:14:19] is they you think they want to go to
[1:14:21] that they don't want to go to that they
[1:14:25] have to see the joy of the Lord be your
[1:14:28] [Applause]
[1:14:40] strength the people the people in the
[1:14:43] hood they have a
[1:14:45] revelation there's something in them
[1:14:47] that's that's they're really
[1:14:50] confident they're really
[1:14:52] if if you don't have that
[1:14:55] they will manipulate
[1:14:57] [Applause]
[1:15:01] you
[1:15:03] sometimes a brother said it was like oh
[1:15:05] man like oh there just a bunch of thugs
[1:15:08] it's like that was like a brother and I
[1:15:09] was like no I was like hold on you you
[1:15:11] won't say that to their
[1:15:17] face we we cuz the Holy Spirit removes
[1:15:20] the unnecessary
[1:15:23] bad but that confidence brings them
[1:15:25] things just that alone just the law of
[1:15:27] the the confidence in them just the law
[1:15:30] of
[1:15:31] confidence they'll go to the basketball
[1:15:33] court and everybody's all and they score
[1:15:35] all the points they can't it it they one
[1:15:37] they're not even good sometimes just
[1:15:39] that confidence that scares the
[1:15:42] [Applause]
[1:15:47] people so me going there as a Son of God
[1:15:50] I'm not scared of
[1:15:51] [Music]
[1:15:53] them sometime I even check your hand
[1:15:55] brother I shake I shake your hand and I
[1:15:57] I like I like that confidence and but
[1:15:59] I'm I'm not they see they they don't
[1:16:01] know they talk trash they're cousing
[1:16:03] like that but that confidence that that
[1:16:05] they
[1:16:06] use I said I like that I want a person
[1:16:08] like that on my team it's a perversion
[1:16:11] of
[1:16:14] it so if you are a
[1:16:17] Christian and the drawer of the Lord is
[1:16:19] your strength cuz you've been given
[1:16:21] Revelation it should give you a Divine
[1:16:23] confidence
[1:16:28] And when they see that Divine
[1:16:30] confidence they won't when they see that
[1:16:33] Divine
[1:16:34] confidence they'll see that something's
[1:16:36] real with these
[1:16:39] [Applause]
[1:16:40] people because the other people they
[1:16:44] they they just kind of Pat me in the
[1:16:46] back but I'm still talking about the
[1:16:47] people in the hood now they still strong
[1:16:49] they they can read people easily they
[1:16:51] can read people easily I know they can
[1:16:54] read people easily
[1:16:57] but when they but when they see
[1:16:59] something
[1:17:01] real be like man B you different
[1:17:06] man
[1:17:09] man some of the stuff you understood I'm
[1:17:13] olding you I'm just understanding it
[1:17:18] now because you took a
[1:17:23] stand people will always respect the
[1:17:27] [Applause]
[1:17:32] stand so do not wave her left and
[1:17:36] right do not move to it from the left or
[1:17:39] move to it with it from the
[1:17:43] right stick with it Forward forsake the
[1:17:46] people that you want to please and stuff
[1:17:47] like that in the future if they're God's
[1:17:50] people they'll look at you and say what
[1:17:52] you did was good
[1:17:53] brother and they'll walk with and you
[1:17:55] gain a
[1:17:57] soul everything works for our
[1:18:01] good this friend that I love so much I
[1:18:04] had to let him go for the gospel but
[1:18:06] then I continue on I continue on and
[1:18:08] then the same stand that I took saves
[1:18:10] him now he's my brother if I would have
[1:18:12] compromised with him right
[1:18:14] [Applause]
[1:18:22] [Music]
[1:18:23] there stand
[1:18:26] h stand for Hol stand for righteous and
[1:18:31] be counted among them that shall
[1:18:35] with you
[1:18:37] [Applause]
[1:18:50] stand the joy of the
[1:18:53] Lord that's why Christian should be
[1:18:56] [Applause]
[1:18:59] happy if I see you when you're a
[1:19:00] Christian and you're not happy I'm
[1:19:02] already
[1:19:04] like something is
[1:19:07] wrong we make we make Christianity like
[1:19:12] depression like oh you know ever since I
[1:19:15] came to the Lord you know the Lord has
[1:19:16] been
[1:19:18] good lord is good Lord is sweet but when
[1:19:22] you were in the world
[1:19:24] [Applause]
[1:19:32] 100% just standing and walking with God
[1:19:35] by
[1:19:37] faith it may be hard in the
[1:19:40] beginning it may feel like you know
[1:19:42] something's that's ups and downs all the
[1:19:44] times we've all been through that but
[1:19:47] eventually there'll be the cream of the
[1:19:48] crop
[1:19:52] [Applause]
[1:19:55] it will be something that goes down to
[1:19:57] the source of who you
[1:20:00] are to where you can't even go back
[1:20:02] anymore and this is now your reality now
[1:20:05] you actually are
[1:20:10] happy that's why Jesus can either only
[1:20:12] he can only look at he can only Bring
[1:20:14] The
[1:20:15] Sinner he can only look at Peter who
[1:20:18] says depart from me I'm a man or I'm
[1:20:20] with sin because there's like there's a
[1:20:23] law in this world that's
[1:20:25] it it's like a magnet there's a North
[1:20:28] Pole and a South
[1:20:31] Pole if I can really say what I'm trying
[1:20:33] to
[1:20:35] say if you basically I'm trying to say
[1:20:39] that the only difference between a
[1:20:41] sinner and a Christian is the Holy
[1:20:48] Ghost so a true Christian if he sees a
[1:20:52] sinner you can get the same thing I
[1:20:55] have but if you that's why I said I'd
[1:20:58] rather you hot or cold cuz if you were
[1:21:00] cold I can make you
[1:21:03] hot and if you are hot stay hot to get
[1:21:06] hotter but because Thou Are art
[1:21:08] [Music]
[1:21:20] lukewarm that's why Jesus could sit
[1:21:22] comfortably with the sinners and not
[1:21:28] compromise he could sit with them and
[1:21:30] not compromise that doesn't mean all
[1:21:32] your friends you hang with Sinners
[1:21:34] because he was still with his disciples
[1:21:35] the majority of the
[1:21:36] [Applause]
[1:21:36] [Music]
[1:21:38] time but when he sees a sinner he's not
[1:21:42] [Applause]
[1:21:43] nervous his faith is not
[1:21:47] hindered he has the fullness of the
[1:21:49] godhead botom
[1:21:51] [Applause]
[1:21:56] and if you are
[1:22:01] [Applause]
[1:22:03] God Jesus had the fullest of the godhead
[1:22:06] body and if we are God and join hirs
[1:22:09] with Jesus Christ it's fuu
[1:22:14] [Applause]
[1:22:20] [Music]
[1:22:20] [Applause]

[1:22:29] Revelation that gives you
[1:22:31] stimulation that gives you Joy that
[1:22:34] gives you strength that makes you run

[1:30:19] and as he lay and slept under a jener
[1:30:21] tree behold then an angel touched him
[1:30:23] and said to him arise and eat and he
[1:30:26] looked and behold there there was a cake
[1:30:29] bacon on the co and the Cru of the water
[1:30:32] at his head and he did eat and drink and
[1:30:35] laid him down again and the angel of the
[1:30:38] Lord came again the second time and
[1:30:40] touched him and said arise and eat
[1:30:43] because the journey is too great for
[1:30:45] thee and he arose and did eat and drink
[1:30:49] and he went in the strength of the meat
[1:30:51] for 40 days and 40 nights onto herab the
[1:30:54] Mount of God may the Lord God bless the
[1:30:55] reading with his word y'all may be
[1:30:57] seated
[1:31:02] am so in this scripture it's it's about
[1:31:05] the Prophet Elijah and Elijah had a
[1:31:08] great journey in front of him and
[1:31:09] brother Bram said the great journey in
[1:31:11] front of him was the top of tribulation
[1:31:13] and the the prophet of God brother
[1:31:15] Brenham also said it was God who was
[1:31:18] holding Elijah to sleep and it was God
[1:31:20] who was waking him up and it was also
[1:31:21] God who fed him because that we know
[1:31:23] that in the the angel of the Lord is God
[1:31:25] himself so I would like to read or at
[1:31:30] least touch a little bit here in
[1:31:32] communion
[1:31:33] 1962 the prophet of God was talking
[1:31:36] about how our body requires constant
[1:31:38] food constant nurturing because if you
[1:31:40] go one day without eating you'll get
[1:31:42] weak you go the next day you'll get
[1:31:44] weaker they go the third G you go you go
[1:31:46] the Third Day by the time you arrive to
[1:31:48] the third day you'll be tremendously
[1:31:52] weaker now if you go with me to First
[1:31:56] John chapter
[1:31:59] 4 I mean John chapter 4 verse
[1:32:07] 32 I'll get
[1:32:14] today if you're there can you say Amen
[1:32:17] now in John chapter 4 verse 32 the
[1:32:20] scripture
[1:32:21] says this was um Jesus after talk to the
[1:32:25] we at the
[1:32:27] well the scripture says but he said unto
[1:32:30] them talk to his disciples I have meat
[1:32:34] to eat that you know not of therefore
[1:32:36] said the disciples one to another have
[1:32:38] any man brought him ought to eat and
[1:32:41] Jesus said unto them my meat is to do
[1:32:43] the will of him that sent me and and
[1:32:45] finish his work over here Jesus is talk
[1:32:48] because the disciple probably with the
[1:32:50] whole entire day they probably didn't
[1:32:51] see Jesus so they came to Jesus ask him
[1:32:53] if he ate and Jesus said already ate but
[1:32:55] no man has seen Jesus eat any food and
[1:32:57] Jesus said that the food that he ate the
[1:32:59] meat that he ate was to do the will of
[1:33:01] God not just hearing but also doing it
[1:33:03] not just being hearer of the word but
[1:33:05] actual uh doers of the
[1:33:08] word and if we keep going
[1:33:12] to 35 say not ye there are yet four
[1:33:16] months and then cometh Harvest behold I
[1:33:19] say unto you lift up your eyes and look
[1:33:21] on the fields for they are white already
[1:33:23] to harvest and he that reapeth receive
[1:33:26] wages and gathereth fruit unto life
[1:33:29] eternal that both he that Seth and he
[1:33:32] that reapeth may Rejoice
[1:33:35] together and therein is that saying true
[1:33:38] one Seth and another one reapeth I sent
[1:33:40] you to the reap I sent you to reap that
[1:33:43] whereon you bestow no labor other men
[1:33:46] labor and ye are entered into their
[1:33:48] labor God already sent us a a prophet
[1:33:51] that already sold the seed that already
[1:33:52] sold the um
[1:33:54] that so dece and all we have to do is
[1:33:56] just benefit of the labor of it and my
[1:34:00] subject today will be divine eating part
[1:34:02] two going beyond your limit because I'm
[1:34:04] trying to get to the point where we we
[1:34:08] get to understand what type of food the
[1:34:09] Elijah eat for him to go through
[1:34:11] tribulation and just be all
[1:34:14] right and to start it off in 1960 the
[1:34:18] prophet was talking about well that's
[1:34:19] what the Pentecost church as soon as
[1:34:21] they as soon as he was born and or many
[1:34:24] other churches when he was born in the
[1:34:25] kingdom of God he becomes Sons and
[1:34:27] Daughters of God but we stopped at that
[1:34:29] when the Pentecostal Church received the
[1:34:31] gift of speaking a tongue and
[1:34:33] interpreting and they stopped at that
[1:34:35] that's no place to stop that's the place
[1:34:36] to begin why we got onta resources
[1:34:39] everywhere all things are possible to
[1:34:41] them that believe everything every
[1:34:43] promise in the Bible belongs to us
[1:34:45] people tend to just stop at the outer
[1:34:47] outer car and think that's where they
[1:34:49] could just chill and just do whatever
[1:34:50] they want but some people their promise
[1:34:53] or their Vision it just stops at the
[1:34:55] gate instead of
[1:34:57] advancing but the Bible says and Prophet
[1:35:00] also says to come up hether little bride
[1:35:02] that mean you have to go a little bit
[1:35:03] further yes sir now in 41 the prophet
[1:35:06] says I haven't got nothing against
[1:35:08] television there's nice things on there
[1:35:10] but when a Christian will stay home from
[1:35:12] church to see some silly play like that
[1:35:14] there's something happened in that
[1:35:16] person's life the Holy Spirit went out
[1:35:18] somewhere you're not about the father's
[1:35:20] business what what do you think he does
[1:35:24] what do you think he does when he comes
[1:35:26] up before the father and has to say that
[1:35:29] his daughters his children his lovely
[1:35:31] daughters is wearing some these immoral
[1:35:33] clothes that they call shorts his
[1:35:36] daughters now in here um the prophet of
[1:35:40] God says in another part he says that
[1:35:42] the Holy Spirit feeds on the word of God
[1:35:45] and that and that's good for you see the
[1:35:48] the prophet says that it's good for you
[1:35:50] to read it's good for you to feed on the
[1:35:51] word of God so when you're not going to
[1:35:53] church and you're doing something else
[1:35:56] that mean you're feeding your spirit
[1:35:57] something else and if going to church is
[1:35:59] good for you that mean if you're doing
[1:36:00] anything else but not listening to the
[1:36:02] word that mean you're destroying your
[1:36:03] own
[1:36:05] body that's why in um Galatians 5 it
[1:36:08] says Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty
[1:36:11] wherewith Christ has made us free and be
[1:36:13] not entangled again in the Yoke of
[1:36:15] bondage that scripture is pretty is
[1:36:18] pretty self-explain so just stand fast
[1:36:20] before God set us free and go and the
[1:36:22] Bible says that he who the son has set
[1:36:24] free that you're free indeed that you
[1:36:26] have to stand fast with the with the sun
[1:36:28] and the Sun is the word because it says
[1:36:30] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:36:31] Word was with God and the Word was made
[1:36:33] flesh so you have to stand fast with the
[1:36:35] word it says this I say then walk in the
[1:36:38] spirit and you shall not fulfill the
[1:36:39] lust of the of the flesh for the flesh
[1:36:42] lust is against the spirit and the
[1:36:44] spirit against the Flesh and these are
[1:36:46] contrary to one another so that ye
[1:36:48] cannot do the things that you would but
[1:36:50] if you be led of the spirit you are not
[1:36:52] under the law see this scripture over
[1:36:54] here because I remember a few weeks ago
[1:36:57] I had a homework that was due at
[1:36:59] midnight so I had to stay up and finish
[1:37:01] my homework but and also my body was
[1:37:03] tired I was feeling sleepy and it was
[1:37:05] cold in the house because it was dark it
[1:37:08] was uh night time but if I would if I
[1:37:11] were to listen to my body to listen to
[1:37:12] My Flesh and go to sleep or take a
[1:37:14] shower then go to sleep I was not going
[1:37:16] to finish my homework on time and I was
[1:37:18] not going to submit it to get the full
[1:37:20] grade that I needed see the scripture
[1:37:22] say that you have to walk in the spirit
[1:37:23] and it doesn't just say walk in any type
[1:37:25] of spirit it says walk in the spirit I
[1:37:27] saying walk in God
[1:37:29] itself and if you walk in God you're not
[1:37:31] going to fulfill the lust of the flesh
[1:37:34] because if you you can walk in any other
[1:37:36] Spirits also and you will still fulfill
[1:37:37] the lust of the flesh because adultery
[1:37:39] is a spirit and um fornication is a
[1:37:42] spirit even pornography is a spirit
[1:37:43] because all those are Spirit and the
[1:37:45] scripture doesn't just say to walk in
[1:37:46] any Spirit but to walk in the spirit of
[1:37:50] God in galatian 6 ver says not be not
[1:37:55] deceived God is Not mocked for
[1:37:56] whatsoever a mess soth that shall he
[1:37:59] also reap that's
[1:38:01] right it tells people to not to not
[1:38:03] deceive themselves because people tend
[1:38:05] to think they could just come to the to
[1:38:06] church to just be a churchgoer and they
[1:38:09] will still go to heaven or meet the
[1:38:13] Rapture and I would like to read uh
[1:38:16] where the Prophet was talking concerning
[1:38:19] this in the message thirst of 1965
[1:38:23] paragraph 178 he says I want you to see
[1:38:25] another great danger just before we
[1:38:28] close if you're if you're not if you're
[1:38:30] not guilty of any of these that's that
[1:38:33] I've mentioned and that is the danger of
[1:38:36] neglecting a thirst see you say I have I
[1:38:39] have the Holy thirst but I'm not guilty
[1:38:41] brother Brenham of just go and joining a
[1:38:44] church and the things like this but see
[1:38:46] to neglect The Thirst if you neglect to
[1:38:48] satisfy the thirst of water or food you
[1:38:51] you'll die and if you neglect The Thirst
[1:38:54] in you for God you will spiritually
[1:38:57] die and if you drop down to 181 the
[1:39:00] prophet says so if you neglect to give
[1:39:02] the Holy Spirit the word of God you'll
[1:39:04] die you Christians you Baptist you
[1:39:07] Methodist you petorian you you Pentecost
[1:39:10] you Assemblies of God Oneness Tess
[1:39:13] threeness whatever you are see don't
[1:39:16] care that don't matter to me that don't
[1:39:18] matter nothing to me I don't think it
[1:39:20] does to God see it's you're an
[1:39:22] individual you're a unit you'll never go
[1:39:24] to heaven as a church you're or a
[1:39:27] denomination you go to heaven as one
[1:39:30] single person between you and God that's
[1:39:33] all don't care what church you belong to
[1:39:35] because some people tend to try to go to
[1:39:37] a church to hide behind a church that's
[1:39:39] right thinking just because the church
[1:39:41] is big oh I'm g go to heaven well my
[1:39:44] pastor is well known I will go to heaven
[1:39:46] well my dad is a preacher so I will go
[1:39:48] to heaven they try to hide behind that
[1:39:50] and paragraph 183 the prophet of God
[1:39:53] says and if you neglect to read the
[1:39:55] Bible and to believe in the Bible and
[1:39:57] the Holy Spirit to feed upon that you
[1:40:00] will die Jesus said this in St John 4
[1:40:03] the scripture got it right Jesus said
[1:40:06] that men shall not live by bread alone
[1:40:08] but by every word not just part but by
[1:40:11] every single word and the other thing I
[1:40:12] also noticed about whenever the prophet
[1:40:14] kept mentioning neglecting the other
[1:40:16] thing that came to mind is backsliding
[1:40:19] because neglecting is just another worm
[1:40:20] of backsliding because if you're
[1:40:22] neglecting something that mean you're
[1:40:23] not going to do something you're
[1:40:24] procrastinating and that's what someone
[1:40:26] that backslides does that's right and in
[1:40:28] one in 191 the prophet say so if you're
[1:40:32] NE if you neglect to eat the Holy Spirit
[1:40:34] the word of God Jesus said every word
[1:40:37] shall be by the Holy Spirit and listen
[1:40:40] now if you try to feed it the wrong
[1:40:43] thing if it's the genuine Holy Spirit in
[1:40:46] you it will know the difference now
[1:40:48] remember the word of God is what the
[1:40:50] Holy Spirit feeds on it don't feed on it
[1:40:53] doesn't feed on enthusiasm it don't feed
[1:40:56] on education it doesn't feed on Church
[1:40:59] goinging it doesn't feed on theologies
[1:41:01] it does there's a lot of difference
[1:41:03] between an inspired something or a
[1:41:05] theological
[1:41:07] standpoint can you imagine there's many
[1:41:09] people that go to church just to get
[1:41:10] like a a degree in theology a degree in
[1:41:13] religion like what are you going to do
[1:41:15] with that degree are that is that degree
[1:41:18] um to serve you to go and start debating
[1:41:20] because we're not in the time to debate
[1:41:22] with one another
[1:41:27] anymore and the prophet of God also says
[1:41:29] if you drop that in7 says now see then
[1:41:33] you had to be before the world was ever
[1:41:35] formed your name was put in the lamp's
[1:41:37] Book of Life and when and then what can
[1:41:40] you eat the Holy Spirit lives by the
[1:41:42] word of God and now in Revelation 22:19
[1:41:45] the Bible says whosoever shall take one
[1:41:47] word out of this or add one word to to
[1:41:51] it his part will be taken from The Book
[1:41:54] of Life see how deep it is you can't you
[1:41:57] cannot the Holy Spirit won't live on
[1:41:59] those things and then brother BR U
[1:42:01] proceeds to use the analogy of a dove
[1:42:03] and a crow and a crow how a crow can eat
[1:42:05] a wheat and and also eat a dead carcass
[1:42:08] but when it comes to a dove a dove
[1:42:09] doesn't eat nothing but beside wheat and
[1:42:12] if he attempts to even eat a dead
[1:42:14] carcass it will die it will cow the same
[1:42:16] thing applies to a Believer a Believer
[1:42:18] is supposed to only feed on the word of
[1:42:19] God if you start feeding on any other
[1:42:21] thing beside the word of God spiritually
[1:42:23] killing themselves and they're not
[1:42:25] benefiting from
[1:42:29] it and the prophet God said that's the
[1:42:31] way that's the way with a real genuine
[1:42:33] Christian you don't want to you don't
[1:42:35] want the things of the world they just
[1:42:37] eat the world they all they just eat the
[1:42:39] word of God and that alone what's clean
[1:42:42] you think the thinking man's filter see
[1:42:45] they come through that and that alone
[1:42:47] the dead things of the world is stink to
[1:42:50] them that mean when you see people doing
[1:42:52] sin to you doesn't it doesn't um it
[1:42:56] doesn't give you Joy it doesn't it
[1:42:58] doesn't give you any Revelation or any
[1:43:00] stimulation into
[1:43:01] you and it says greater should be the
[1:43:04] thirst of any soul of for the Waters of
[1:43:07] life than to say you belong to a church
[1:43:09] to The Thirst of the Soul cannot be
[1:43:12] satisfied the real true thirst it can be
[1:43:15] perverted you can think you're all right
[1:43:18] when you join church but that isn't it
[1:43:21] that won't satisfy the genuine holy holy
[1:43:23] thirst for God it simply won't do it it
[1:43:26] just it just not there when you join a
[1:43:29] church you're just deceiving yourself
[1:43:30] you're like oh I'll will go to a church
[1:43:32] and I'll just feel comfortable and just
[1:43:33] relaxing you're just deceiving yourself
[1:43:35] as the scripture say because you're not
[1:43:37] mocking God you're mocking yourself
[1:43:38] because at the end of the race when
[1:43:40] you're not there people will start
[1:43:41] asking well I thought that person was a
[1:43:43] saint I thought that person he always
[1:43:44] come to church dress all nice and acting
[1:43:47] all nice I thought that person was a
[1:43:48] saint but he ends up going to hell he
[1:43:50] ends up going through tribulation that's
[1:43:52] right now in verse eight says for he
[1:43:54] that sth to his flesh shall of the flesh
[1:43:57] reap corruption but he that sth to the
[1:43:59] spirit shall of this shall of the spirit
[1:44:02] reap Everlast life Everlasting and let
[1:44:05] us not be worried in well dooing for in
[1:44:07] due season we shall reap if we faint not
[1:44:10] see it says over here that if you're
[1:44:11] going after the things of the world if
[1:44:13] you're going after the spirits of the
[1:44:15] word or or the flesh you will die
[1:44:18] because if you remember the scripture
[1:44:20] says Out of the Dust y came and to the
[1:44:21] dust y shall return that mean the
[1:44:23] desires of this flesh is only temporary
[1:44:25] it's only corner it's only a mortal
[1:44:27] desire meaning if you're Desiring things
[1:44:29] of this world at some point it will just
[1:44:32] stop like people that take drugs and
[1:44:33] stuff like that they they will have that
[1:44:35] little sensation for a little while but
[1:44:37] when people come to church and hear the
[1:44:38] word you're G to have that sensation it
[1:44:39] will go with you home also unlike when
[1:44:42] people are addicted to wrong
[1:44:49] things now the prophet of God says in we
[1:44:53] would see Jesus paragraph 70 it creat is
[1:44:56] all right but just doesn't satisfy till
[1:44:59] you get down to the word and a man shall
[1:45:01] not live by bread alone but by every
[1:45:02] word that proceedes out of the mouth of
[1:45:04] God that's what men shall live by the
[1:45:06] word of God the word of God is the man's
[1:45:09] spiritual spiritual Daily Bread is the
[1:45:12] word of God manifested
[1:45:14] sir and the prophet of God also speaks
[1:45:17] about how the
[1:45:19] um how when you have to eat daily when
[1:45:23] when you eat daily builds up your
[1:45:25] resistance to disease that mean it
[1:45:27] builds up your immune system and the
[1:45:29] same thing applies with your spiritual
[1:45:31] aspect because when you eat physically
[1:45:34] when you eat physically when you when
[1:45:37] you don't eat physically rather when you
[1:45:38] don't eat food you become weak that mean
[1:45:41] when a disease come when a pandemic come
[1:45:44] it hates you after you get sick the same
[1:45:46] thing applies with the word if you don't
[1:45:47] eat the word um constantly somebody can
[1:45:50] come with a spirit that that they can
[1:45:52] come in your presence and touch your
[1:45:54] that you might end up catching that
[1:45:55] spirit that they have because you
[1:45:56] because you you didn't fortify
[1:45:59] yourself that's what I want to get you
[1:46:01] this whenever I see this picture where
[1:46:02] it says what are you are what you eat
[1:46:04] because the the carrot it reinforces the
[1:46:07] eye and the um Grace reinforces the lung
[1:46:10] when I was looking at this the first
[1:46:11] defense mechanism the first defense
[1:46:13] mechanism of a human of an individual is
[1:46:16] their body then you have to reinforce
[1:46:18] that body because your body is like your
[1:46:19] armor that protects you against disease
[1:46:21] and and I remember um in the
[1:46:26] scripture and I remember in the
[1:46:27] scripture he also speaks about how we do
[1:46:29] not wrestle against fleshly Blood by
[1:46:31] principalities and powers and wickedness
[1:46:34] in high places and he tells us to put on
[1:46:35] the full armor of
[1:46:37] God it tells us to put on the full armor
[1:46:40] of God and brother Brenham says that the
[1:46:42] whole armor of Christianity is
[1:46:44] Supernatural look at the Christian armor
[1:46:46] love joy peace longsuffering goodness
[1:46:49] meekness gentleness peace patience is
[1:46:52] that right see all those things are
[1:46:55] Christian armor and when you look at the
[1:46:56] Bible it says to put on your La gra
[1:46:59] about the truth and we remember Jesus
[1:47:01] Christ says I am the truth I am the way
[1:47:03] and he says to put on the breastplate of
[1:47:05] righteousness and that's melchisedec
[1:47:07] which is the king of righteousness put
[1:47:09] on the shoes of preparation of the
[1:47:11] gospel of peace which is also melkisedek
[1:47:13] the the prince of peace and it says to
[1:47:15] put on the shield of faith faith cometh
[1:47:18] by hearing and hearing of the word of
[1:47:19] God and it says put on the helmet of
[1:47:22] salvation and he says for the grace that
[1:47:24] Grace being Jesus Christ of God that
[1:47:26] bringeth salvation have appeared to all
[1:47:28] men my grace is sufficient to you
[1:47:31] speaking about
[1:47:32] Adonai then it says to have the sword of
[1:47:34] the spirit which is the word of God
[1:47:36] because in the beginning was the word
[1:47:38] and Jesus Christ is that word and if you
[1:47:40] look at that whole entire armor is Jesus
[1:47:42] Christ himself that mean you're putting
[1:47:44] Jesus Christ on you you're putting Jesus
[1:47:46] Christ in you until Jesus Christ is
[1:47:48] covering your whole entire being
[1:48:06] now if we go to Matthew um 19 it says or
[1:48:09] else how can one enter into a strong
[1:48:11] man's house and spoil his good except
[1:48:13] the first bind the strong man and then
[1:48:16] he will spoil his house either make the
[1:48:19] free either make the tree good or his
[1:48:21] fruit good or else make the tree corrupt
[1:48:24] or his fruit corrupt for his tree is
[1:48:27] known by his fruit see the first
[1:48:29] scripture talks about how can um someone
[1:48:32] for example like Samson how can someone
[1:48:33] strong like Samson get tied unless if he
[1:48:35] lets um that person tie him up because
[1:48:38] Samson the Bible say he was a very
[1:48:39] strong man he had the strength of God in
[1:48:41] him because God was with him but the lia
[1:48:43] is someone that was even the someone
[1:48:45] that's weaker than him tremendously
[1:48:47] weaker than him managed to tie him up
[1:48:50] and certain people in this world in this
[1:48:52] current time they're getting tied by the
[1:48:54] devil and they're getting tied because
[1:48:55] they're letting the devil tie them
[1:48:57] because you're strong you have God
[1:48:59] behind you just like Sam have God behind
[1:49:00] it but samel let himself let himself be
[1:49:04] subjected to the law of the Flesh and
[1:49:06] lust after a woman and that lust
[1:49:07] produced that lust led him to Devy away
[1:49:10] from God and leted him to get tied up by
[1:49:12] the enemy and the same thing most people
[1:49:14] are doing today they're letting
[1:49:16] themselves get tied by the devil they
[1:49:17] get letting them themselves get tied by
[1:49:19] the circumstances of this world they let
[1:49:21] them themselves get tied by those
[1:49:25] and on the second part brother brandom
[1:49:27] gave uh was talking
[1:49:29] in in 1962 in forsake all things he gave
[1:49:34] an analogy of a a blind deaf man who was
[1:49:37] also dumb who kept going to Sunday
[1:49:38] school and every time he went to Sunday
[1:49:40] school people asked him why are you
[1:49:41] comeing to Sunday school and after he
[1:49:43] was like I'm going to Sunday school to
[1:49:44] show people where I stand to show the
[1:49:46] devil and everyone else where I stand
[1:49:48] and the scripture says to be either
[1:49:50] either you're a true um your
[1:49:53] either you're a tree of good or you're a
[1:49:55] tree a tree of good with his fruit being
[1:49:58] good or you're a tree of corruption with
[1:50:00] his fruit being corruption then there's
[1:50:01] no 50/50 there's no mixed multitude
[1:50:03] there's no being um lukewarm or
[1:50:05] neglecting stuff there's no being a
[1:50:07] backsliding Christian because that time
[1:50:09] of being a backslide of playing church
[1:50:10] are over that mean you're supposed to be
[1:50:12] you're supposed to show yourself as the
[1:50:14] brother was saying as the brother was
[1:50:16] saying that real recognize real that
[1:50:18] mean you're supposed to be real and if
[1:50:20] you're being real
[1:50:22] and if you're being real even the devil
[1:50:24] will notice that you're being real even
[1:50:26] the devil will have to take more
[1:50:28] precaution when he's coming towards you
[1:50:29] when you're being real and in paragraph
[1:50:31] 34 it says oh generations of vipers how
[1:50:34] can ye being evil speak good things for
[1:50:36] out of the abundance of the heart the
[1:50:38] mouth speakers and
[1:50:42] as excuse me
[1:50:56] see it says all generations of vipers
[1:50:58] how can you being evil speak good things
[1:51:01] meaning this in this generation here
[1:51:03] when you whenever you open the TV and
[1:51:04] you look at watching the news and stuff
[1:51:07] like that the things that are being
[1:51:08] promoted are things that are contrary to
[1:51:10] the word that are against God so how can
[1:51:12] a generation that are raised by looking
[1:51:14] at those type of things be able to speak
[1:51:17] good or make good come out of their
[1:51:18] heart they can't do that because they're
[1:51:20] raised in a certain uh manner they're
[1:51:22] raised in a certain
[1:51:23] way that's right the scripture also say
[1:51:25] a good man out of the good Treasure of
[1:51:29] of the heart bringeth forth good things
[1:51:31] and the evil man out of the evil
[1:51:32] treasure bringeth forth evil things see
[1:51:34] when I was reading this scripture that
[1:51:36] the Revelation dropped and I was like
[1:51:37] because I remember Jesus said no one is
[1:51:39] good but God so I decided to replace
[1:51:41] good with God and I was like a god man
[1:51:43] out of the god Treasure of their heart
[1:51:44] bringeth forth God thing meaning if we
[1:51:47] had to break it down a God man is a
[1:51:48] child God things are like doing Miracles
[1:51:51] like Jesus um when he multiplied the
[1:51:53] bread walked on water and stuff like
[1:51:54] that and when I was pondering on this I
[1:51:57] was thinking he said a god Treasure of
[1:52:00] of the heart bringeth forth God things a
[1:52:02] god treasure and I was like what thing
[1:52:04] inside a man inside the heart that's
[1:52:07] Godly that's good and I was thinking and
[1:52:09] I remember brother BR brother Brandon
[1:52:11] when he was talking he spoke about how
[1:52:13] the how us human we have three
[1:52:16] Department we have
[1:52:17] the soul spirit and body and usually the
[1:52:20] spirit take control of the Mind and the
[1:52:23] Soul goes inside the heart and then
[1:52:25] within the soul there's a seed inside
[1:52:27] there and that seed is the part of God
[1:52:29] and God is the only one that's good so
[1:52:31] that seed inside you is is that thing
[1:52:33] that's Pro that's um that's helping you
[1:52:36] do good things that seed inside you is
[1:52:38] the thing that's pushing you to do good
[1:52:40] things but a a evil man out of the evil
[1:52:43] treasure bringeth forth evil things
[1:52:45] because they have no seed in them so
[1:52:46] there's nothing there's no good in them
[1:52:48] because before the foundation of the
[1:52:50] world when God filled our eternity God
[1:52:52] was all light God was good and when God
[1:52:54] shrunk himself the emptiness that stayed
[1:52:56] there that was sin and that evilness if
[1:52:58] you don't have God in you that mean you
[1:52:59] have that Darkness you have that sin in
[1:53:01] you that mean there's not there's
[1:53:02] nothing within you to to um to do to
[1:53:06] produce good things there's nothing in
[1:53:08] you to produce Godly
[1:53:12] things in Matthew 6 it says for where
[1:53:15] your treasure is is there where your
[1:53:18] heart is also where your heart be also
[1:53:21] see when I read when I read this
[1:53:22] scripture reminded me of a time when I
[1:53:24] was younger and inside my house a cousin
[1:53:26] came in took one of my toys and after
[1:53:27] that head inside my parents house inside
[1:53:29] my parents bedroom and since I couldn't
[1:53:32] reach the light I took a match to try to
[1:53:34] find it until the match burnt my head
[1:53:36] after they dropped and the the uh house
[1:53:38] got on fire but the thing the thing that
[1:53:40] I want you to draw from that story is
[1:53:42] because I was a kid and he took what
[1:53:44] belonged to me I went and pursued it
[1:53:47] because that toy was my treasure at that
[1:53:48] time the same thing applies with y'all
[1:53:50] what is that thing that if somebody take
[1:53:52] from you that will push you to go pursu
[1:53:54] it see the other thing that you can also
[1:53:57] P that can also help you identify what
[1:53:59] your treasure is when you go to the
[1:54:00] shower or when you're meditating or when
[1:54:02] you're working what's the first thing
[1:54:04] that comes into your mind because David
[1:54:06] said in the
[1:54:07] comfort in the multitude of my thought
[1:54:09] that comfor the my soul so when you're
[1:54:12] thinking when you're pondering what are
[1:54:13] you pondering about what's what's
[1:54:15] bringing joy into you what's that thing
[1:54:17] that when when you're working and you
[1:54:19] feel tired and after that it comes in
[1:54:21] and after that you think think about it
[1:54:22] gives you Joy it gives you energy what's
[1:54:24] that thing that you have to think
[1:54:36] about and in paragraph 23 says the light
[1:54:39] of God is the eye if therefore thy eye
[1:54:42] be single thy whole body shall be full
[1:54:44] of light but if thy eye be evil thy
[1:54:48] whole body shall be full of darkness and
[1:54:50] if therefore the light that is empty be
[1:54:53] Darkness how great is that darkness no
[1:54:55] man can serve to master for either he
[1:54:58] will hate one hate the one and love the
[1:55:01] other or else he will hold to the one
[1:55:04] and despise the other you cannot serve
[1:55:06] God in mment you cannot serve God and
[1:55:08] after that go to um the world and after
[1:55:11] that party later on you cannot do that
[1:55:13] because because you will e you will end
[1:55:15] up back because that's what back that's
[1:55:17] the definition of backsliding because
[1:55:19] you're sering you're TR you're trying to
[1:55:21] serve two people you're trying I'm not
[1:55:23] saying you're serving you're trying to
[1:55:24] serve two people
[1:55:25] that's and even in Matthew 13 like you
[1:55:28] can read it when you get home Matthew 13
[1:55:31] uh vers 15- 23 he talks he says blessed
[1:55:35] are are your eyes for they see and your
[1:55:37] ears for they hear for many prophets and
[1:55:40] righteous men they desire to see what
[1:55:42] you see they desire to hear what you
[1:55:43] hear there's many people many people in
[1:55:45] the in the denomination that are also
[1:55:47] locked that are trying to see what you
[1:55:49] see and see the prophecies that we see
[1:55:51] see the revelations we see and
[1:55:52] experience what we see there's many
[1:55:55] people like there's many people that are
[1:55:59] that are walking and all these seeds
[1:56:01] they they don't have a good eye as
[1:56:03] because single here means good eye they
[1:56:05] don't have a good eye they're they're
[1:56:06] not healthy if I were to take this water
[1:56:08] bottle and I P it here after I tell
[1:56:09] brother Charles come here and grab this
[1:56:11] water bottle he can walk over here and
[1:56:12] grab it but somebody that's in darkness
[1:56:14] if I tell him to come grab this water
[1:56:15] bottle they will trip they will fall
[1:56:17] they will stumble on themselves in fact
[1:56:18] they might not even come and reach this
[1:56:19] water bottle right here
[1:56:22] and in Mark 7 Jesus talks gives a
[1:56:25] parable about it's not what's it's not
[1:56:27] what you eat that goes to the belly that
[1:56:29] defiles man but it's what goes into the
[1:56:31] heart and if you have a good eyes that
[1:56:33] mean you're looking at the scripture
[1:56:35] you're looking at the word you're eating
[1:56:37] the word that will go to your heart and
[1:56:38] that will only produce good
[1:56:45] things in 1960 of hear ye him the
[1:56:48] prophet of God says and that's the way I
[1:56:50] preach the gospel if this
[1:56:56] just to give you like a story This was
[1:56:57] um the prophet when whenever
[1:57:03] he if this let me just read if this
[1:57:06] makes you sick it might stir up some of
[1:57:09] your gastronomics of the Bible and the
[1:57:11] things that the things started and get
[1:57:14] things started that's right that's right
[1:57:16] we need the oldfashioned gospel we need
[1:57:17] the power of God the Holy Ghost back in
[1:57:20] and all the Hollywood tevion starts out
[1:57:24] move out you know lady I want you to say
[1:57:27] something to I want to say something to
[1:57:28] you and I'm going to get to the man just
[1:57:30] a moment but lady I want you to say to
[1:57:33] say something I want to say something to
[1:57:35] you did you know that that's an unclean
[1:57:38] Spirit come on you do you know a little
[1:57:40] lady goes down the street all sexy
[1:57:42] dressed you do you know that the woman
[1:57:44] is going to have to answer to committing
[1:57:46] adultery well she might be as pure as a
[1:57:49] lily to her boyfriend or to her husband
[1:57:53] by the Bible says Jesus said that if
[1:57:55] whosoever lookth upon a woman and lost
[1:57:58] after her committeth adultery with her
[1:58:00] already in in the heart in his heart if
[1:58:03] you're dress if you're dressed like that
[1:58:05] and some sinner look looks at you in a
[1:58:08] way that the day of Judgment at the at
[1:58:11] the day of judgment when he answers for
[1:58:13] committing adultery it'll be with you
[1:58:15] and it'll be your fault because you're
[1:58:18] presenting yourself to him you might not
[1:58:20] come back tomorrow
[1:58:22] but you're going to hear it one time see
[1:58:26] that's that's right that's an evil
[1:58:28] spirit that comes upon
[1:58:34] you see um well I want to take from here
[1:58:37] because many people love to say well
[1:58:39] when you bring them and you tell them
[1:58:41] the way they're dressed and you're
[1:58:42] confronting them by the way they're
[1:58:44] dressed and stuff like they tend to say
[1:58:45] well it's my body I can do what I want
[1:58:47] or sometime they're like well I'm not
[1:58:49] hurting anybody it's just my body I'm
[1:58:51] just doing it for myself while the
[1:58:52] prophet of God was talking in influence
[1:58:54] 1963 paragraph 17 he gave an an
[1:58:56] knowledge of a little CH of a little
[1:58:58] child that his dad every Christmas like
[1:59:02] not every Christmas but one Christmas
[1:59:03] his dad was going from house to house
[1:59:05] drinking so on his way home there was
[1:59:07] snow and his dad was walking all wobbly
[1:59:09] and stuff like that and the little kid
[1:59:11] behind him was following in his footstep
[1:59:13] just going like that just following in
[1:59:15] his footstep and his dad turned around
[1:59:16] and look and his kid was a far off and
[1:59:19] his dad stopped to wait for the kid to
[1:59:21] come to come near him and when the kid
[1:59:24] come um arrived near him the dad asked
[1:59:26] him what are you doing and after that
[1:59:28] the little fell was like daddy I'm
[1:59:30] trying to step on your footstep I'm
[1:59:31] trying to copy you see the prophet of
[1:59:33] God used that to demonstrate that kids
[1:59:34] are there watching what you do Al you
[1:59:36] saying Al you're saying I'm dressing
[1:59:38] this way for myself I'm not as stumbly B
[1:59:40] from anybody else Al they're confronting
[1:59:41] you about it but there's little kids
[1:59:44] that they can't separate the good from
[1:59:46] bad unless if you told them that mean if
[1:59:47] they see someone that's dressed
[1:59:49] immorally they will copy that reproduce
[1:59:51] it so sometime sometime a kid may come
[1:59:53] home from Square after they acting a
[1:59:55] certain way after they their parent
[1:59:56] might ask where did you learn this
[1:59:57] that's because at school certain people
[1:59:59] are addressing certain way certain
[2:00:00] people are doing a certain habit that
[2:00:02] the kids peek up and suck it in and and
[2:00:06] the prophet of
[2:00:07] God and the prophet God also says in
[2:00:10] 1963 in influence paragraph 14 says and
[2:00:14] you know what your children is one of
[2:00:16] the main ises that watch that's watching
[2:00:19] you they watch what you do and whatever
[2:00:21] ever you do they copy after you because
[2:00:24] you're setting the example before them
[2:00:26] to what you do and the prophet God said
[2:00:28] the books of Corinthians like the book
[2:00:30] of Correction and in First Corinthians
[2:00:32] chapter um 8 verse 9 I'm not going to
[2:00:36] read it because to save time but it
[2:00:38] speaks about how you have free will and
[2:00:41] you you shouldn't just because you have
[2:00:42] free will you shouldn't use that to be
[2:00:44] you shouldn't be a stumbling block for
[2:00:46] your fellow brother and sister you
[2:00:47] shouldn't use that free will to be a
[2:00:49] stumbling block for your fellow brother
[2:00:50] and sister but that free will when God
[2:00:52] gave free will to humanity it was a trap
[2:00:55] to the seed of the devil because the the
[2:00:57] seed of the devil when they see free
[2:00:59] will they're like I guess I could do
[2:01:00] whatever I want I guess I could go to
[2:01:02] church and I can go I could go to church
[2:01:03] on Monday that I go to the club on on um
[2:01:06] I could go to the church on Sunday and
[2:01:07] go to the club on Monday or I could go
[2:01:09] to the amusement part as long as I'm not
[2:01:12] looking after any as long as I'm not
[2:01:14] looking at anybody that's dressing
[2:01:16] tomorrow I can go to the bowling bowling
[2:01:17] alley or to the prophet God said not to
[2:01:20] see yes
[2:01:26] see the concept of Free Will is just
[2:01:27] there to trip up the children of the of
[2:01:29] the devil but when a Believer a true
[2:01:33] seed of God when they have free will the
[2:01:34] moment they they receive the revelation
[2:01:36] of their position them they're obligated
[2:01:39] automatically to follow the word of God
[2:01:41] them they can't leave you away from the
[2:01:42] word of God they have to stay close to
[2:01:44] the word of God they have to keep on
[2:01:45] feeding on the word of God they can't
[2:01:47] Devi it away from that that's why Free
[2:01:49] Will is just a trap for the devil
[2:01:55] and in 1960 hear ye him paragraph the
[2:01:58] prophet of God says now that's the way
[2:02:00] the church has got about God we see the
[2:02:03] spirit of God in a Revival fall and
[2:02:05] Shake people and get up out of the
[2:02:06] wheelchair and the lame walk and the
[2:02:09] blind see and the spirit of God fall
[2:02:11] into the meeting discern the very
[2:02:12] thoughts of their heart and the great
[2:02:14] prophetic things will go forth that's
[2:02:16] the perfect that's perfect every time
[2:02:19] just exact just exactly and the church
[2:02:21] says well that's all right big water
[2:02:24] chewing G sitting sitting right there
[2:02:26] you know yes that's all right but we're
[2:02:28] going to see Lucy tomorrow night and we
[2:02:31] just ain't going to the pastor wants to
[2:02:34] condemn us let him condemn us we'll go
[2:02:36] over to this other denomination if he
[2:02:39] wants to condemn us we'll go over and
[2:02:42] join the if they run us out of the
[2:02:46] Church of God we go to the assembly they
[2:02:49] they run us out of the assembly we'll go
[2:02:50] to the oness run us out of the Oneness
[2:02:52] we'll go to the TW Ness to the threeness
[2:02:55] to all so far and so so far and so on
[2:02:57] see
[2:03:02] and and I just want to read um
[2:03:06] in the sermon thir 1965 to add on to
[2:03:10] that the prophet of God say in paragraph
[2:03:12] 173 says a vulture wants dead things
[2:03:14] that's right and it and that's
[2:03:16] dead and that's dead that's exactly
[2:03:19] right plainly shows it it just plainly
[2:03:23] shows here what is their head and their
[2:03:25] control tower what's giving them see
[2:03:29] what's what's in their soul they're so
[2:03:31] longest for things like that they're so
[2:03:33] longest for a high intellectual Church
[2:03:35] where the people dress real nice real
[2:03:38] fine and the pastor takes 15 minutes or
[2:03:41] 20 or 20 and if you go over there over
[2:03:44] that they draw him back on the Deacon
[2:03:47] board and he mustn't say nothing about
[2:03:50] Sin he must say anything about wearing
[2:03:53] shorts about saying nothing about people
[2:03:55] doing things that or the other he
[2:03:57] mustn't mention that at all if we if
[2:04:01] they do the board will have him throw
[2:04:03] out see what it is that's their thinking
[2:04:06] man's filter see which that reminds me
[2:04:09] back in middle school because my class
[2:04:12] had this bad habit of running teachers
[2:04:13] out of uh class and they were brag about
[2:04:16] it too they would go to another student
[2:04:17] and be like well we just ran this
[2:04:18] teacher out and we just got this teacher
[2:04:21] fired and they would boast about it and
[2:04:23] the teacher could be trying to help them
[2:04:25] and the teach and the student don't like
[2:04:27] the way the teacher is teaching that
[2:04:28] they would they would just take they
[2:04:30] will get the teacher fired and the same
[2:04:32] thing applies with church many people
[2:04:34] when the pastor is coming to correct and
[2:04:36] people don't like that they would try to
[2:04:38] push the pastor
[2:04:39] off they'll try to push the pastor off
[2:04:42] either they push the pastor off or they
[2:04:44] will leave the church and if they go to
[2:04:45] different Church
[2:04:52] now in um in the sermon
[2:04:57] of in in here in 1960 here your hand the
[2:05:01] prophet God says so we just SE until the
[2:05:04] last one is send out seen meaning
[2:05:06] fishing and then Jesus with will come
[2:05:10] how do we know who they are you just
[2:05:13] throw the gospel in that and throw it
[2:05:15] and draw that's why I come here with my
[2:05:18] brethren stand on the corner somewhere
[2:05:21] and throw the net with them reach out
[2:05:23] with my Ministry and pull it and say
[2:05:26] there there they are Brethren what is it
[2:05:29] now but this is the burnt over territory
[2:05:32] did you notice back there when I first
[2:05:35] come to you in Oregon people was coming
[2:05:38] from everywhere thousands times
[2:05:40] thousands crowding
[2:05:42] in oh it was fine I was just going along
[2:05:46] praying for the sick but when I come
[2:05:49] back and begin to lay the truth down
[2:05:52] laying the gospel down oh many turned
[2:05:54] aside see many many people come to
[2:05:57] church and when there's a healing
[2:05:59] companion there's something concerned
[2:06:00] about healing the body they will be
[2:06:02] quick to come they'll be the first one
[2:06:03] even on the prayer line but when it
[2:06:05] comes to healing of character or healing
[2:06:08] of your spirit people tend to run away
[2:06:10] from that people tend when they just
[2:06:12] read the scripture that they say oh um
[2:06:15] people cried out to God that after God
[2:06:16] sent the word and the word healed them
[2:06:18] people tend to just take that scripture
[2:06:19] as in healing their body but the word of
[2:06:22] God when it comes it comes to correct
[2:06:23] and correction is a top of healing and
[2:06:26] the Bible also said love is corrective
[2:06:28] that mean if if a pastor is coming here
[2:06:31] and bringing out the word and telling
[2:06:32] you to change your life change your ways
[2:06:33] that mean he loves you if your father is
[2:06:35] coming and telling you what you did here
[2:06:37] was wrong and you need to change it that
[2:06:38] mean he's showing love to you that mean
[2:06:40] you need to change the way you are you
[2:06:41] need to you need to change the way you
[2:06:44] are and and improve
[2:06:53] because what that also remind me is like
[2:06:56] because that
[2:06:57] correction that correction is like it's
[2:07:00] your sanctification when you're in the
[2:07:01] Holy in the Holy place that's San that's
[2:07:04] sanctification when you're in the Holy
[2:07:06] place
[2:07:08] and let me just read uh the prophet here
[2:07:11] real quick then I'll just wrap
[2:07:14] up in dors door 1965 but see it's like
[2:07:18] the church has to pass through the Hall
[2:07:21] of credit
[2:07:22] we go through you're going to be called
[2:07:24] Holy Rollers you're going to be called
[2:07:27] Everything But If You Could Only Hold
[2:07:30] Your Position in Christ then someday
[2:07:33] he'll take us to the heartall of Fame
[2:07:36] but first with God is stand we have to
[2:07:39] stand criticism there is a there is
[2:07:41] where the littleness of us
[2:07:44] stand there is where it shows he cannot
[2:07:47] stand chastisement chastisement is
[2:07:51] he cannot stand chastisement is an
[2:07:53] illegitimate child and not a child of
[2:07:56] God no matter how much he's joined
[2:07:59] church and whatever he's done he's still
[2:08:02] he if he cannot stand chastisement he's
[2:08:05] an
[2:08:06] illegit and he's not a real child of God
[2:08:09] but a real genuine child of God don't
[2:08:12] care what the world says every
[2:08:15] everything else is secondary he's got
[2:08:18] his mind on Christ and that settles it
[2:08:20] yes whatever Christ says do he'll do it
[2:08:23] wherever the lamp goes there wherever
[2:08:27] the lamp
[2:08:28] goes there are with
[2:08:31] Him ex wherever and then you see his
[2:08:35] appearing his presence and what he does
[2:08:38] he is always with his people his bride
[2:08:41] he is courting her someday there is
[2:08:43] going to be a wedding supper when God is
[2:08:46] there and right now God is preparing us
[2:08:48] he's just pling out see that what that
[2:08:50] correction does remind me of uh um the
[2:08:54] artist uh michelangela when he was just
[2:08:57] chipping off everything that was in
[2:08:58] Moses see ran out like the sermon that
[2:09:00] was preached on Sunday telling us that
[2:09:02] we are gods and that we need to be on
[2:09:04] our position we need to step into our
[2:09:06] position of God and when the word is
[2:09:07] coming it's removing our complexes it's
[2:09:10] removing anything that's ungodly into US
[2:09:13] preparing us for the wedding supper
[2:09:14] because when God when the wedding when
[2:09:17] God comes down to marry the groom the
[2:09:19] groom must be United with God he must be
[2:09:23] she must be one with God she must be
[2:09:25] like God she must be God and judge with
[2:09:28] God because when you get judge with God
[2:09:30] first you can't judge with God if you
[2:09:32] can't even judge yourself you can't
[2:09:33] judge with God when somebody's giving
[2:09:35] you correction you're not going to
[2:09:36] accept correction how are you going to
[2:09:38] judge with God how is God going to allow
[2:09:40] you to judge with him when you can't and
[2:09:41] judge your fellow peers
[2:09:53] um say my time is running so far we've
[2:09:57] spoke about how you need to take the
[2:09:59] word and the word by eating the word it
[2:10:02] reinforce your armor it will reinforce
[2:10:04] your body it will give you
[2:10:07] strength and it will also gives you
[2:10:09] protection because that protection will
[2:10:11] help you away from disease and sickness
[2:10:14] not I'm not talking about physical
[2:10:15] sickness but spiritual sickness
[2:10:17] spiritual spiritual disease spiritual
[2:10:20] demons and spiritual attacks
[2:10:21] and we also learn about how the word
[2:10:23] comes to correct because people when
[2:10:25] they hear the word when they hear when
[2:10:27] they hear the word healing they're just
[2:10:28] thinking about well I have a healing
[2:10:31] here I'm sick here my legs is broken and
[2:10:33] I need God to repair my leg but they for
[2:10:35] they tend to forget when the pastor is
[2:10:38] there giving um the word breaking the
[2:10:40] word and the word is telling you you
[2:10:42] need to change your
[2:10:44] life that the word is telling you you
[2:10:45] need to change your life that's the type
[2:10:47] of healing on itself because it's
[2:10:49] plucking out anything else that's bad
[2:10:52] and it's just purifying it's a type of
[2:10:56] sanctification exactly you're just
[2:10:58] washing Yourself by the word by the word
[2:11:00] of
[2:11:04] God if the P come
[2:11:08] [Applause]

[2:12:02] Bram said the sickest body that he know
[2:12:05] of is the body of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:12:07] he need a spiritual healing and brother
[2:12:10] Bram say the only bomb that he knows
[2:12:12] that can heal the body is the word of
[2:12:14] God Amen when we eat the word it will
[2:12:17] bring healing to our body healing to our
[2:12:20] spirit healing to our soul and when the
[2:12:23] revelation of the stimulation struck
[2:12:26] there then he produce joy and the joy of
[2:12:30] the Lord is our strength and with that
[2:12:33] strength we can run the race all the way
[2:12:36] to the finishing line I will see God
