[39:14] code i load them with
[39:18] scripture and what i want you to do when
[39:20] you go home i know you hear
[39:23] sit down go back and get the note and
[39:26] get your scripture and get your note

[39:38] either by the scripture if you're
[39:39] talking about somebody who's not in a
[39:41] message if somebody in the message then
[39:43] you pull the scripture and you back it
[39:45] up with the code together so that's why
[39:46] we're putting them together if somebody
[39:48] asks you why you don't wear a paint you
[39:50] already have a scripture if they in a
[39:52] message you load it why you don't put
[39:53] makeup it's right there so you have
[39:55] everything together we preach on all of
[39:57] that i even asked brother
[40:00] david to do me a favor on the uh i being
[40:03] i believe it's king hazaris we preach
[40:05] like 45 sermons and we preach about the
[40:08] black dog and everything so if they can
[40:10] change the title
[40:12] so whoever needs a reference about high
[40:14] heel or whatever it is you can go
[40:16] straight ahead and go buy the title and
[40:19] find it quickly amen
[40:21] so just get a habit get a note put it
[40:24] down especially young people you will
[40:26] need one of this day even if you want to
[40:28] witness to somebody you want to bring
[40:31] them to the message you need to know
[40:33] your scripture very well because you
[40:35] need to approach with the scripture
[40:36] first and then went about the scripture
[40:39] then the bazooka is behind
[40:42] that you can follow the prophet let's go
[40:45] to exodus chapter 26
[40:49] if you're there you can say amen
[40:53] you bear with us about the sound system
[40:56] brother david can you mute
[41:00] you give me
[42:44] one benefit to be in church
[42:48] all right exodus chapter 26 verse 1
[42:52] moreover you shall make the tabernacle
[42:55] you might be seated
[42:56] with 10 curtains of fine twine
[43:00] lining i already got my
[43:02] birthday present for the year
[43:06] some ex
[43:07] believer
[43:09] god gave that believer an inspiration
[43:11] but they don't want to tell me the name
[43:14] amen
[43:15] so we will be making the tabernacle
[43:20] making the tabernacle with ten curtains
[43:22] you should be aware of that now
[43:24] we've turned curtains of fine lining the
[43:28] first
[43:29] material used is fine lining
[43:34] it's twine because that's the way they
[43:36] made it
[43:37] fine linen and blue
[43:41] and purple
[43:44] and scarlet
[43:47] with
[43:48] caribbeans
[43:49] i'm going to stop here if i touch the
[43:51] kerry beams you're not going to go to
[43:53] eat
[43:54] amen
[43:55] so we will try to pick all four here and
[43:58] clear them up today if i get in the
[44:00] caribbean you'll stay here more hours
[44:03] amen
[44:04] all right because you need to understand
[44:06] what a caribbean means and where do we
[44:08] start with caribbeans so we gotta trace
[44:10] caribbean from genesis and go down this
[44:13] way
[44:14] so you know amen not just reading it and
[44:17] kerry beams no and ten curtains of fine
[44:19] twine linen and blue
[44:21] and purple and scarlet with caribbeans
[44:25] so these color when they mix them
[44:28] together they gotta mix them with the
[44:30] caribbeans
[44:32] anybody care
[44:33] you will see what it means
[44:35] with caribbeans of canning works shall
[44:38] you make them
[44:40] the length of one curtain shall be eight
[44:42] and 20
[44:43] qubit you should be aware of 28 now
[44:46] and the breadth of one curtain four
[44:48] cubits so it's four by twenty eight
[44:51] and every one of the curtains shall have
[44:54] one measure so as you keep putting them
[44:56] together the 28 doesn't change
[44:59] the four are that but not the 28.
[45:02] the five curtains shall be coupled
[45:05] together one to another you remember
[45:07] this now and other five curtains shall
[45:09] be coupled one to another grace and
[45:12] grace
[45:13] and you shall make
[45:15] loops of blue upon the edge of the one
[45:18] curtain from the sleeve edge in the
[45:20] coupling and likewise you make the in
[45:23] the outermost edge of another curtain in
[45:26] the coupling of the second the picture
[45:28] will help you clarify this clearly
[45:31] 50 loops shall you make in one curtain
[45:34] and 50 loops shall you make in the edge
[45:36] of the curtain that is in the coupling
[45:38] of the second that the loops may hold
[45:42] one another may hold one of another and
[45:45] you shall make 50 touches or hooks
[45:48] of gold
[45:50] and couple the curtain together with the
[45:52] touches and it shall be one tabernacle
[45:56] so the key word here
[45:59] this whole
[46:00] covering here this whole curtain here is
[46:03] a tabernacle so when you talk about the
[46:06] tabernacle you're talking about this
[46:08] curtain
[46:10] if you remove this curtain there is no
[46:11] tabernacle
[46:13] every other curtain that was put on top
[46:15] of this was a covering
[46:18] upon the tabernacle anybody here so far
[46:22] amen go to verse seven
[46:24] because somebody's
[46:26] giving me a glance that i'm not catching
[46:28] it
[46:29] let's go to seven and you shall make
[46:32] curtains of goat hair we will get to
[46:34] that later
[46:35] to be a covering upon them
[46:39] in other words upon this everybody here
[46:43] so this is the tabernacle when they say
[46:45] the tabernacle this is the tabernacle
[46:48] and this tabernacle is not the entire
[46:52] tabernacle
[46:53] ever care because the tabernacle have
[46:56] three parts
[46:58] but the way the tabernacle was built it
[47:01] was not built like we usually showed
[47:03] that the tabernacle was built like this
[47:09] everybody here
[47:11] this is the other coat
[47:13] so when you get in the other coach you
[47:15] can go all around
[47:17] everybody here but the true tabernacle
[47:20] is this one
[47:22] this is the terminal
[47:25] anybody here so when you go to the book
[47:27] of hebrew you will see paul talking
[47:29] about the first time in alcohol in the
[47:31] second time in alcohol when we get into
[47:32] the caribbean you're gonna see that
[47:34] clearly i know we usually do this to
[47:37] make things easier for you
[47:39] like this
[47:40] but truly this is the way it is
[47:43] amen
[47:45] okay praise be the name of the lord
[47:48] let's go to esther chapter 4.
[47:54] so when they tell you that they put a
[47:56] covering or they make this tabernacle
[47:58] what they were actually making was this
[48:01] they have to put wood and ovulate them
[48:04] with gold and everything then
[48:06] discovering was going all over and that
[48:09] covering was called dead tabernacle so
[48:12] when they say cover the tabernacle
[48:14] that's what it means
[48:15] the other they will tell you it's a good
[48:18] uh hairs or a ram skin or something like
[48:21] that but this specifically is a
[48:23] tabernacle let's go to esther chapter
[48:25] four
[48:26] if you're there you can say amen
[48:28] you should be now good and familiar and
[48:31] comfortable with the book of esther
[48:33] verse 11 and all the king servant
[48:37] and the people of the king's province
[48:40] do know
[48:41] that whosoever
[48:43] whether man
[48:45] or woman
[48:46] shall come to the king
[48:48] into the
[48:50] everybody
[48:52] and we know that in the tabernacle we
[48:54] also have an inner court because this
[48:57] was the other court
[49:00] anybody care then this was the holy
[49:03] place
[49:04] every care
[49:06] and this was the holiest
[49:09] the holy of the holiest that is the
[49:12] intercourt
[49:14] inner coat
[49:17] back here
[49:19] so what esther is telling you before you
[49:22] get here
[49:23] because in the inner court in the
[49:25] tabernacle that's where the ark of the
[49:28] covenant was and on top of the ark of
[49:30] the covenant we have the mercy seat
[49:33] and the mercy city where the pillar of
[49:35] fire was sitting so when the pillar of
[49:37] fire entered the tabernacle he's going
[49:39] to pass through here pass there and go
[49:42] in between the two caribbeans
[49:45] you see now
[49:46] into between the two caribbeans and in
[49:48] between there that's where the pillar of
[49:50] fire sits so when you enter the inner
[49:53] court the one that you see there
[49:55] is god amen so
[49:58] the one that you see sitting on the
[50:01] throne brother branham said the mercy
[50:03] city is a throne and if we talk about a
[50:06] throne we're talking about a king
[50:08] everybody
[50:09] so nobody can enter into the inner coat
[50:14] you see the book of esther got a
[50:16] tabernacle
[50:17] amen
[50:19] mickey amen
[50:21] and all the king's servant and the
[50:24] people of the king's province do know
[50:27] that whosoever whether man or woman both
[50:31] of them anybody care
[50:33] shall come to the king into the inner
[50:36] court you can play all you want on the
[50:39] outside
[50:40] the problem is into the king everybody
[50:43] here if you're not there lord's willing
[50:45] on the coming sermon i'm going to show
[50:47] you what is your characteristic
[50:50] what is how what are the symptoms of
[50:53] somebody who's not in here
[50:56] what are the symptoms of somebody who's
[50:57] here
[50:58] how would you know that you're here and
[51:01] how do you know that you're there
[51:03] and it will determine your step in
[51:05] christianity
[51:07] amen and you will see why certain things
[51:10] linger on your life
[51:12] and you don't get delivered
[51:14] it is just it depends on where you are
[51:17] and back here
[51:18] you see certain habits don't go ever
[51:22] here
[51:23] but you're still a good christian
[51:25] but certain habits don't go there is
[51:28] something that is there
[51:30] there is a place that you are standing
[51:32] that's what is causing you the problem
[51:35] and as long as you don't move forward
[51:38] from that spot
[51:39] the habit will never leave you
[51:42] and the more you linger you can get in
[51:44] trouble
[51:45] because the only way for you to be safe
[51:49] is if you enter the outer court and you
[51:52] die there
[51:54] then you can go to heaven
[51:57] amen
[51:59] did you hear me
[52:00] if death struck you here
[52:04] you can go to heaven
[52:05] but if death doesn't strike you here and
[52:08] you still alive
[52:11] it's a dangerous ground you don't stay
[52:13] there amen
[52:14] amen
[52:15] let me help somebody
[52:17] if you are at the cross
[52:20] did you get it
[52:22] and there is no way to baptize you
[52:25] you already crucified with jesus christ
[52:28] as long as you accept christ there
[52:31] and you die
[52:33] jesus christ can rescue you from there
[52:35] and take you to heaven
[52:37] anybody here
[52:38] because that's the last chance that you
[52:40] have
[52:41] before death that's why people go to the
[52:43] hospital before they die they give their
[52:46] life to god and they go to heaven
[52:48] but if you are alive
[52:50] that's the problem
[52:53] that's where the problem is
[52:55] if you are
[52:57] baptized and you're not dead
[53:00] that's the problem
[53:02] you cannot stop ready you need to keep
[53:04] moving
[53:06] if not denomination is coming to you
[53:10] everybody here once they denominated you
[53:12] then you're dead
[53:16] amen don't worry amen you will get to
[53:18] that i'm doing this so he stir you up
[53:21] amen
[53:23] whoever
[53:24] woman oh man
[53:27] shall come into to the court to the king
[53:30] into the inner court
[53:32] who is not called
[53:34] you must be called
[53:36] anybody here so not everybody will get
[53:39] there
[53:39] who is not called there is only one law
[53:43] of his
[53:45] to put him to death
[53:48] except
[53:50] the only exception
[53:51] such to whom the king
[53:54] not the prince
[53:56] did you hear me
[53:58] not anybody he must be the king himself
[54:01] amen
[54:02] only the one who the king
[54:05] shall hold out the golden
[54:08] scepter
[54:09] because the golden scepter is only at
[54:12] the end of the king
[54:14] amen anybody here
[54:16] so your justification must come by the
[54:20] king yes sir
[54:25] because when you enter you are already
[54:27] guilty
[54:28] somebody needs to free you but there is
[54:31] nobody that can free you but the king
[54:33] himself
[54:35] with the golden scepter anybody care
[54:39] that he may leave but i have not been
[54:42] called to come into the king these 30
[54:45] days we will find number 30 down the
[54:47] road when we talk about the goat curtain
[54:50] let's go to romans 1 and then we will
[54:53] pray
[54:56] hallelujah
[54:59] blessed be the name of the lord
[55:02] if you dare you can say amen
[55:06] page is still flipping
[55:09] israel's awakening
[55:15] you got it
[55:16] if you're there you can say a man
[55:19] verse 20
[55:20] for the invisible things of him
[55:24] from the creation of the world
[55:26] are clearly sin
[55:28] how can you see something invisible
[55:31] god is invisible how can you see god
[55:35] amen
[55:36] being understood
[55:39] by the things that are made
[55:42] so whatever is created he got a message
[55:45] anybody care amen even his eternal power
[55:50] and godhead
[55:51] so that they are
[55:53] without excuse in other words the
[55:56] invisible things of god
[55:58] can be understood by the visible things
[56:02] of god amen especially the one that god
[56:05] pointed you to amen anybody care if god
[56:09] tell you take gold
[56:11] there is something god is talking about
[56:13] he's not telling you really take the
[56:14] material he's talking about something
[56:17] the message in the material and the
[56:20] messages in the material is only a
[56:23] reflection of what you cannot see with
[56:26] your eyes
[56:29] we're clear now
[56:30] let's pray
[56:31] buddy david put me back where i was
[56:34] heavenly father
[56:35] lord we thank you again for your grace
[56:38] your love your mercy and for everything
[56:40] you have been doing for us father thank
[56:42] you for opening the way so that we can
[56:45] come into the service this morning
[56:47] despite lord the rough weather outside
[56:50] we know that one of this day father you
[56:52] will come to pick up your breath and we
[56:54] won't have to go through this kind of
[56:56] weather anymore lord jesus christ when
[56:58] we go through them it's always reminding
[57:01] us that this is not home there is a
[57:03] better place that is better far better
[57:06] than this one lord and our heart our
[57:08] pounding every single day lord father
[57:12] wedding and yearning for that day lord i
[57:14] have done what every human being that
[57:16] you give an ability to do can do this is
[57:19] the best that i can do father and i'm
[57:22] asking that you move me completely out
[57:24] of the way may you come down and speak
[57:26] to your children lord for the anointers
[57:29] anoint the one who is hearing the one
[57:31] who's streaming and lord father anointed
[57:34] the officer in the offices lord father
[57:36] and lord speak to us in the mighty way
[57:39] in the name of jesus christ
[57:41] amen
[57:42] amen god bless you
[57:44] you've already been seated
[57:47] we are dealing with the tabernacle
[57:50] curtain
[57:51] we on part two
[57:54] brother branham says in the statue of a
[57:56] perfect man
[57:58] he said
[57:59] i'm getting started late this morning
[58:02] about 15 minutes early or so then we
[58:05] shall take
[58:07] we shall just take our time now
[58:09] because we don't want to get in a hurry
[58:16] when you get in a hurry
[58:18] then you just ruin the things you were
[58:20] going to say
[58:22] i was listening at the tape the other
[58:24] day
[58:25] as i told you and i got so ashamed of
[58:27] myself
[58:29] not what i was saying by the way i was
[58:32] saying it too fast
[58:34] and it's just a nervous speech i feel
[58:38] like wedding so when i take my time i go
[58:41] slowly there is a reason foul
[58:44] everybody care
[58:45] we went into the level
[58:48] and from the level we are now into the
[58:51] tabernacle when we talk about the level
[58:54] we started in exodus 40 and the level
[58:58] opened up the door about the high priest
[59:01] and his son
[59:03] that we went through left and right back
[59:05] here
[59:06] and the high priest and his son
[59:09] were washed in the left which we know
[59:11] already represented the world and back
[59:14] here and when they were washed in the
[59:16] water they have to be dressed a certain
[59:19] way
[59:20] but it is very important to always
[59:23] remember
[59:25] that who was washing the high priest
[59:28] the one who was washing the high priest
[59:30] and his family
[59:32] was not an ordinary man
[59:36] anybody
[59:37] the one who was doing that was moses
[59:40] as far as human he was ordinary
[59:44] but yet he was a major prophet
[59:46] and back here
[59:48] and as a major prophet he was granted
[59:51] the privilege to wash the first high
[59:54] priest under the levitical priesthood
[59:57] ever here and if jesus christ is our
[1:00:01] high priest which we already
[1:00:03] demonstrated and explained it to you
[1:00:06] jesus also must be watched by a prophet
[1:00:09] amen
[1:00:10] amen everybody care
[1:00:12] and not an ordinary prophet
[1:00:15] he must be a major prophet
[1:00:19] uh back here
[1:00:20] because when we look at moses everything
[1:00:23] that moses was doing was natural
[1:00:27] but when the prophet came when jesus
[1:00:30] christ came we never seen jesus christ
[1:00:33] himself washing people
[1:00:36] jesus never went into the tabernacle
[1:00:39] bringing the people and washing them
[1:00:41] ever here because when christ came
[1:00:45] the dispensation began to change
[1:00:48] they used to take an instrument and
[1:00:51] sound the jubilee but when jesus christ
[1:00:54] came
[1:00:55] jesus changed the jubilee from an
[1:00:58] instrument
[1:01:00] into the gospel
[1:01:02] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[1:01:05] because he have anointed me to preach
[1:01:07] the gospel to preach the acceptable year
[1:01:11] to preach the year of jubilee so jubilee
[1:01:15] was no more a natural trumpet
[1:01:17] but jubilee now was a gospel trumpet
[1:01:22] ever here and when jesus christ also
[1:01:25] came the washing also changed
[1:01:28] from the natural water into a spiritual
[1:01:32] water
[1:01:35] in ephesians chapter 5
[1:01:37] the bible says paul say husband
[1:01:40] love your wife
[1:01:42] even as christ also loved the church and
[1:01:46] gave himself for it
[1:01:47] that he must sanctify
[1:01:50] do you see that
[1:01:51] and cleanse it
[1:01:53] with the washing of the water what kind
[1:01:56] of water
[1:01:57] by the word now the water become the
[1:02:01] word
[1:02:02] but you must know what kind of word
[1:02:06] because the old testament order was
[1:02:09] handled by a prophet
[1:02:11] god who in sandra trams and inaudible's
[1:02:15] mother spoke to our father by the
[1:02:18] prophet
[1:02:20] everybody here
[1:02:22] brother branham said a prophet
[1:02:25] is a reflector of god
[1:02:28] [Applause]
[1:02:29] anybody here so far
[1:02:31] a prophet is not god
[1:02:34] a prophet is not an object to worship
[1:02:38] a prophet is only a son
[1:02:41] reflecting god
[1:02:45] but here
[1:02:46] instead of god speaking
[1:02:48] god is using a prophet as a mouthpiece
[1:02:52] that's why the prophet said that save
[1:02:55] the lord
[1:02:56] in other words the mouth of a prophet
[1:03:00] become the mouth of god
[1:03:04] hallelujah
[1:03:05] a prophet is a reflector of god
[1:03:09] he is made so that
[1:03:11] he cannot speak his own words
[1:03:14] he has to be god's word
[1:03:17] that he speaks
[1:03:18] he's just like a reflector and he is god
[1:03:23] mouth peace
[1:03:25] everybody
[1:03:26] in other words when there is no prophet
[1:03:31] god is blood
[1:03:39] do you hear me when a prophet appeared
[1:03:42] on the scene
[1:03:44] the prophet actually freed the mouth of
[1:03:47] god because god now can speak to a
[1:03:50] prophet
[1:03:52] according to what happening more
[1:03:54] horrible
[1:03:55] [Music]
[1:03:57] hallelujah
[1:03:58] blessed be the name of the lord in hosea
[1:04:01] chapter 6
[1:04:03] josiah say i have unioned them by the
[1:04:07] prophet
[1:04:09] it doesn't mean
[1:04:11] that the prophet
[1:04:12] have a who
[1:04:15] or maybe a machete that he was using out
[1:04:19] the people
[1:04:20] that's not what he means
[1:04:22] the bible said that i used them by the
[1:04:24] prophet i have slammed them by the word
[1:04:28] of my mouth
[1:04:29] that's why elijah could speak and fire
[1:04:32] come down
[1:04:33] it was not elijah killing
[1:04:36] he was god killing through elijah
[1:04:40] he was not moses bringing the plague
[1:04:44] he was god bringing the plague through
[1:04:47] moses
[1:04:51] in recognizing your day and its message
[1:04:54] brother branham say he's interpreting
[1:04:56] this he said i have you
[1:04:59] you'd
[1:05:00] now watch israel he's talking to i have
[1:05:03] viewed or other word i have chopped
[1:05:08] chop them out
[1:05:09] through the water
[1:05:11] so not only is a prophet
[1:05:14] a mouthpiece
[1:05:16] but a prophet by his word he's a tool in
[1:05:20] the hands of god ever here
[1:05:23] that is how god does his people
[1:05:26] he chop them out from the rest of the
[1:05:29] nation
[1:05:30] what by
[1:05:31] his storage sword his water he chopped
[1:05:37] them
[1:05:37] his nation from the nations he chop his
[1:05:41] nation from the nation
[1:05:43] by the prophet
[1:05:45] his vindicated water
[1:05:47] so has he chopped the bread from the
[1:05:50] denomination
[1:05:52] by his word
[1:05:54] promised by malachi 4
[1:05:57] in the last word
[1:05:59] chop out his bride
[1:06:01] you heard from the rest of the churches
[1:06:04] you out his water
[1:06:06] is ewing them by the word of a prophet
[1:06:11] and the word of a prophet is a message
[1:06:16] everybody cleared so far
[1:06:18] everybody cleared so far
[1:06:20] brother branham also says this
[1:06:22] that according to the rules of the
[1:06:25] church
[1:06:27] in the old testament
[1:06:29] comer or he's correcting now the new
[1:06:32] testament rather
[1:06:34] at the first place
[1:06:36] that the people enter into the church of
[1:06:38] god
[1:06:39] in a spirit of worship
[1:06:41] and the walking
[1:06:42] hymns were sung
[1:06:44] and maybe the preacher
[1:06:46] would speak for he was a prophet of the
[1:06:50] church
[1:06:52] a preacher is a prophet
[1:06:55] a new testament prophet
[1:06:58] is a preacher
[1:07:00] we know that
[1:07:01] the testimony of jesus christ
[1:07:04] is the spirit of water
[1:07:07] so when the anointing of the holy ghost
[1:07:09] come upon a preacher he's actually
[1:07:12] prophesying to that local church
[1:07:22] but
[1:07:24] we have to understand an order
[1:07:27] they are in the book of revelation the
[1:07:30] bible says there was a lamb
[1:07:32] that have seven horns
[1:07:35] and seven eyes
[1:07:37] in other words every horn have an eye
[1:07:41] brother branham says this
[1:07:43] he says seven eyes
[1:07:45] are the seven messengers of the church
[1:07:48] ages
[1:07:50] seven i seven water
[1:07:52] you know seer is a prophet
[1:07:54] hey the seven eyes eyes means seeing
[1:07:59] seeing means what
[1:08:02] in other words seven churches
[1:08:06] have seven eyes
[1:08:08] and those seven eyes are seven prophets
[1:08:12] but i'm call them sometime pastors
[1:08:16] they are prophets
[1:08:18] by the spirit of prophecy
[1:08:22] only two of them are prophet by
[1:08:25] birth
[1:08:28] which is paul
[1:08:29] and brother bronner
[1:08:31] like moses and elijah
[1:08:35] everybody okay so far
[1:08:37] this lab has seven horns
[1:08:39] and on each horn had an eye
[1:08:42] what is it
[1:08:44] it is christ and his brother
[1:08:47] seven church edges
[1:08:49] out of there were seven weapons
[1:08:52] prophet that went fourth seventh years
[1:08:56] so the last one must be a water
[1:08:59] so the last one paul and brother branham
[1:09:02] are not only prophet by the spirit of
[1:09:05] prophecy
[1:09:06] but they are prophet by birth
[1:09:10] [Music]
[1:09:11] did you hear me
[1:09:13] hallelujah where are you going to
[1:09:15] because there is a pattern
[1:09:18] there is another that preacher must
[1:09:21] understand
[1:09:23] in every age we have exactly the same
[1:09:27] pattern
[1:09:29] everybody care because when aaron was
[1:09:33] killing the ball
[1:09:34] he have to enter the holy of holies
[1:09:37] and he have to take the blood of the
[1:09:40] ball
[1:09:41] and then spray on the mercy seat seven
[1:09:44] times
[1:09:46] that was the high priest in the old
[1:09:48] testament but under melchizedek our high
[1:09:52] priest is jesus christ
[1:09:54] but he entered with his own blood
[1:09:57] in a tub an alcohol that was not made by
[1:10:00] hand
[1:10:00] but in the book of revelation we found
[1:10:04] him with seven stars
[1:10:06] in his hand
[1:10:10] ever here
[1:10:11] because a mercy seat must be sprinkled
[1:10:14] seven times
[1:10:16] throughout the seventh church in jesus
[1:10:18] name
[1:10:19] here so as that age open
[1:10:22] he will take one star
[1:10:24] and he sprinkled the edge
[1:10:27] and the blood will be
[1:10:33] do you hear me
[1:10:35] that's why you heard brother branham say
[1:10:37] believing world
[1:10:38] in other words the mercies of god
[1:10:41] are given to the messenger and when the
[1:10:44] messenger comes he's opening the door of
[1:10:48] mercy
[1:10:49] so that you can enter the kingdom of god
[1:10:53] once he finished
[1:10:55] he closed the door
[1:10:57] and the same messenger
[1:10:59] take the vow and pour upon the people
[1:11:05] brother branham said in every age we
[1:11:08] have exactly the same pattern
[1:11:11] that is why their life
[1:11:15] comes through some god-given messenger
[1:11:18] in a certain area
[1:11:20] and then from that messenger
[1:11:26] the messenger our prophet
[1:11:28] the father foreign ministry
[1:11:31] are also prophets
[1:11:34] everybody here and back here we have to
[1:11:37] understand the pattern of god he moved
[1:11:40] from the messenger
[1:11:42] to the far far ministry
[1:11:45] but here you cannot play with that order
[1:11:49] but the problem is
[1:11:51] the firefight ministry must be
[1:11:54] faithfully taught
[1:11:58] [Music]
[1:12:00] they don't want teaching
[1:12:02] he said in a certain area and then from
[1:12:06] that messenger they spread the light
[1:12:10] through the ministry of who
[1:12:12] so the light of the messenger is spread
[1:12:16] through the firefox ministry
[1:12:20] anybody
[1:12:22] hallelujah
[1:12:24] who has been faithfully taught
[1:12:27] but of course
[1:12:28] all those who go out
[1:12:32] all those who go out
[1:12:34] among the far foreign ministry
[1:12:37] this is the order of god from the
[1:12:39] messenger to the faithful ministry you
[1:12:42] cannot touch the firefall ministry
[1:12:44] and you cannot touch the messenger
[1:12:48] ever here you cannot play because this
[1:12:51] is god order to bring perfection into
[1:12:55] the bride
[1:12:56] you must get the light and give the
[1:12:59] light to the fire for ministry
[1:13:02] and the light of the firefight ministry
[1:13:05] is actually the light from the messenger
[1:13:08] and the light of the messenger is the
[1:13:11] light from god
[1:13:13] follow me as i follow christ
[1:13:17] [Music]
[1:13:17] [Applause]
[1:13:20] hallelujah
[1:13:21] but of course all those who go out
[1:13:25] don't always learn
[1:13:27] how necessary it is to speak only
[1:13:32] what the messenger has spoken
[1:13:36] they add here
[1:13:38] or take away them and soon the message
[1:13:41] is no longer
[1:13:43] and the revival
[1:13:46] why is the revival dead in message
[1:13:48] churches
[1:13:51] check the purity
[1:13:53] of the message
[1:13:58] everybody here
[1:13:59] everybody here how careful we must be to
[1:14:02] hear one voice
[1:14:05] for the spirit has bad water
[1:14:09] the messenger
[1:14:10] which is the voice of god
[1:14:14] he warned them that even he paul
[1:14:17] could not change one word of of what he
[1:14:20] has given by revelation
[1:14:22] oh how important it is to hear the voice
[1:14:26] of god by the way of his word
[1:14:30] seven of them and then say what has been
[1:14:33] given to them
[1:14:35] to say to the water
[1:14:38] so the seven messengers are prophets
[1:14:42] the five four ministers are prophets
[1:14:45] they are prophet under the spirit of
[1:14:48] prophecy under the prophet of the age
[1:14:52] amen
[1:14:54] here so a new testament prophet is a
[1:14:58] prophet
[1:14:59] but
[1:15:00] under the prophet of your age
[1:15:05] ever here
[1:15:07] ever care
[1:15:08] because proverbs say
[1:15:11] that the spirit of a man
[1:15:14] is a candle
[1:15:16] of the lord
[1:15:17] because in brother in another
[1:15:20] translation it's called a lamp
[1:15:23] because when you go
[1:15:25] in the book of revelation before the
[1:15:27] throne of god there is seven nights
[1:15:31] seven candles
[1:15:33] seven lamps
[1:15:34] and those seven lamps represented the
[1:15:37] spirit of men
[1:15:39] if you need a coach you see me
[1:15:41] but here
[1:15:42] that's the reason why under the second
[1:15:45] pool brother branham always say i'm
[1:15:47] trying to contact your spirit
[1:15:50] do you remember that because your spirit
[1:15:52] is a candle amen it is a light amen
[1:15:57] the bible says searching all the water
[1:16:01] in one part of the water
[1:16:03] that belly is not this belly
[1:16:06] because john have to eat the book
[1:16:09] and he was sweet in the belly it was not
[1:16:11] this belly it is the heart
[1:16:14] here in other words your spirit
[1:16:17] is the light that god uses
[1:16:20] to check your heart
[1:16:23] amen
[1:16:24] you hear me
[1:16:25] that's why even with the woman at the
[1:16:28] well god have to contact her spirit
[1:16:31] that's why brother branham have to
[1:16:33] contact your spirit once he catches your
[1:16:36] spirit amen he already have the light
[1:16:39] amen and then with your spirit he goes
[1:16:42] in your subconscious and then brother
[1:16:44] branham begin to discern the heart of
[1:16:47] the people he's using your spirit as a
[1:16:49] candle as a light to see what is in your
[1:16:53] heart then he begin to tell you your
[1:16:55] name is so and so you came from so and
[1:16:58] so this is what happened to you this is
[1:17:00] what you have he's contacting your
[1:17:02] spirit and your spirit is the flashlight
[1:17:05] he's going into your life because the
[1:17:07] spirit of man is a light
[1:17:13] this message is perfectly in line with
[1:17:17] the scripture
[1:17:21] so the spirit of a man is a candle
[1:17:26] jesus said about john he said john was a
[1:17:30] burning and a shining water
[1:17:33] you call him a man
[1:17:35] when jesus looked at him he's looking at
[1:17:37] the light
[1:17:39] at fire amen
[1:17:41] anybody care
[1:17:43] he said and you were willing for a
[1:17:45] season to rejoice in his water
[1:17:49] but jesus also said
[1:17:51] that no man
[1:17:53] when he had lighted a candle
[1:17:56] put this in the water
[1:18:00] neither under a water
[1:18:02] but you put it on water
[1:18:05] how many candlesticks do we have in the
[1:18:07] church
[1:18:09] so when god turn a light
[1:18:14] amen do you follow me
[1:18:16] it's more vaccine this is the second
[1:18:18] dosage
[1:18:20] you follow me
[1:18:21] do you follow me when god turned a
[1:18:24] candle up you don't put that candle
[1:18:28] under the bushes
[1:18:31] you need to find the candlestick
[1:18:34] in other words you don't hide the
[1:18:36] message of the edge
[1:18:42] do you hear me
[1:18:44] if there is a church
[1:18:46] that is proclaiming to follow this
[1:18:49] message but they don't want to read the
[1:18:52] code
[1:18:53] under property they are hiding the
[1:18:56] candle
[1:18:57] under the bushes
[1:18:59] get out of that church
[1:19:01] [Applause]
[1:19:01] [Music]
[1:19:04] do you follow me if a pastor doesn't
[1:19:07] want cut to be read in his puppet and
[1:19:11] he's still coming to be part of this
[1:19:14] message he's trying to hide the candle
[1:19:18] telling pastor pull the candle up
[1:19:22] put it on the candlestick
[1:19:25] [Music]
[1:19:32] hallelujah that's why we are not a shame
[1:19:36] to talk about brother branham
[1:19:38] we are not ashamed to talk about this
[1:19:41] message
[1:19:42] where brother braddon sent the truth we
[1:19:46] will tell you
[1:19:47] where he lied
[1:19:48] and repented we will tell you we will
[1:19:52] tell you everything about him
[1:19:57] because paul said i have not shunned to
[1:20:01] declare you the whole council of god
[1:20:08] everybody
[1:20:10] that's why the bible says brother
[1:20:12] branham said the bible say brother brown
[1:20:15] i'm saying
[1:20:17] the bible
[1:20:18] is our reference then brother brandon
[1:20:21] back it up
[1:20:22] anybody clear
[1:20:23] everybody
[1:20:24] you don't put it or that you put it on
[1:20:26] the candlestick
[1:20:28] that they which come in
[1:20:30] may see the water but the light is the
[1:20:33] message you are hiding the message how
[1:20:37] are people going to see the light
[1:20:46] when you go to your job
[1:20:48] you become the light
[1:20:50] you become the message and when the
[1:20:53] people see you they can see the
[1:20:55] messaging
[1:20:56] they can see the message by your life
[1:20:59] they can see a message by your character
[1:21:01] they can see the message by your love
[1:21:04] they can see the message by the way you
[1:21:06] talk
[1:21:09] now it's no more a cut it becomes a
[1:21:12] person a living being
[1:21:15] because the message is a person
[1:21:18] [Applause]
[1:21:22] you can carry this bible all you want to
[1:21:24] work
[1:21:26] you won't attract anybody if your life
[1:21:29] is wrong
[1:21:32] for somebody to ask you questions about
[1:21:34] the bible they must see how serious you
[1:21:37] are
[1:21:38] for somebody to test about the message
[1:21:40] you gotta show them the message yourself
[1:21:45] everybody here
[1:21:46] because the light of the body is the
[1:21:49] water
[1:21:52] and the eyes are the seven messengers
[1:21:57] that's the light of the body
[1:21:59] of that age
[1:22:01] that's the light of the body
[1:22:03] but here jesus said either what woman
[1:22:06] having 10 pieces of silver if she lose
[1:22:10] one piece
[1:22:11] do not write a what
[1:22:15] you want to find what you lost
[1:22:17] you need a candle
[1:22:19] [Applause]
[1:22:21] anybody care
[1:22:22] you need a candle you need the word you
[1:22:25] need the message
[1:22:27] and the message
[1:22:29] will light up your life
[1:22:31] and then when the message light up your
[1:22:33] life
[1:22:34] then you take the broom
[1:22:36] and you begin to sweep your house
[1:22:39] you begin to get all the trashes out
[1:22:42] by the light of the message
[1:22:45] by the light of the message
[1:22:48] brother branham say don't smoke out but
[1:22:51] the branham say don't do this out
[1:22:54] brother branham said look in the
[1:22:55] scripture this is out
[1:23:01] you want to sweep your house
[1:23:02] you need a light
[1:23:04] not any kind of light you need the light
[1:23:07] that was prepared for that age
[1:23:09] that's why denominations are unable to
[1:23:13] sweep their life
[1:23:14] because the light they're using is not
[1:23:16] god provided life
[1:23:20] hallelujah and sweep the house and seek
[1:23:24] water
[1:23:25] until you water
[1:23:28] to seek you need the light
[1:23:30] to sweep you need the light
[1:23:32] you're using that light
[1:23:34] to shine on your life and show you the
[1:23:37] imperfection
[1:23:38] and then from there you can move on ever
[1:23:41] here so we found out after that watching
[1:23:47] that that same prophet
[1:23:49] comes and dressed the high priest
[1:23:53] amen
[1:23:54] you can read it and go
[1:23:56] but you need to know what did he dress
[1:23:58] the high priest with
[1:24:01] john
[1:24:02] watch jesus christ
[1:24:06] do you have a scripture where john put
[1:24:08] the clothes on jesus christ
[1:24:14] but jesus was clothed
[1:24:17] in the river jordan
[1:24:18] another clothes enter
[1:24:20] that was not there before
[1:24:25] do you follow me
[1:24:26] do you follow me
[1:24:28] the clothing mars is put on aaron aaron
[1:24:31] didn't have them before
[1:24:34] so what is the clothing
[1:24:36] to understand the clothing that jesus
[1:24:38] got you need to go back in the cabinet
[1:24:42] amen and to see what was worrying uh
[1:24:44] what was aaron wearing then you would
[1:24:47] know what is in christ
[1:24:49] here
[1:24:50] because the bible says
[1:24:52] it is like the precious ornament
[1:24:55] upon the
[1:24:56] head because when you look here after
[1:25:00] moses put the garment
[1:25:02] he anointed
[1:25:04] aaron how did they anoint him
[1:25:07] in other words the garment
[1:25:09] was mixed with oil
[1:25:12] but when they wash jesus in jordan what
[1:25:15] is the oil they put on him
[1:25:18] what is the garment
[1:25:20] they were not doing that by any chance
[1:25:22] they were doing that because of the old
[1:25:24] testament because they have to wash the
[1:25:26] lamb
[1:25:27] but when you wash what are you gonna do
[1:25:31] the oil upon aaron the bible says that
[1:25:35] he was upon the head
[1:25:38] yes amen
[1:25:41] everybody here so when they bring their
[1:25:44] anointing on they don't put it on the
[1:25:46] shoulder
[1:25:51] i hope you're awake
[1:25:52] they don't put it on the back
[1:25:56] they don't put it on the hand
[1:25:58] the anointing no must start at the head
[1:26:07] everybody here
[1:26:08] i hope you're catching it
[1:26:10] upon the head that run down upon the
[1:26:13] water
[1:26:14] the high priest must have built
[1:26:21] do you hear me so the head of the high
[1:26:24] priest
[1:26:25] must come with me
[1:26:27] [Applause]
[1:26:28] [Music]
[1:26:32] this message
[1:26:34] is in the bible
[1:26:37] hallelujah upon the build the build of
[1:26:40] who
[1:26:42] the high priest must have built
[1:26:45] so the anointing all when it comes it
[1:26:48] comes with the head
[1:26:50] but the head that he builds
[1:26:54] [Applause]
[1:26:59] hallelujah
[1:27:00] and then after the head
[1:27:03] and the builder sucked
[1:27:06] with the anointing
[1:27:07] then the rest of the body
[1:27:10] can get the anointing
[1:27:12] all the way to the water
[1:27:15] all the way to the water to the skirt
[1:27:18] what is in the skirt
[1:27:20] [Music]
[1:27:22] in other words the entire body is soaked
[1:27:26] by the start with the head
[1:27:28] and the beard
[1:27:33] in coronado forest
[1:27:36] when the picture of the cloud was taken
[1:27:39] brother branham god told him take the
[1:27:42] picture and turn it to the right
[1:27:47] and brother brother begin to give the
[1:27:49] description
[1:27:51] not the description of a foot
[1:27:54] not the description of his shoulder
[1:27:57] but a description of their head
[1:28:04] but i'm saying here
[1:28:06] here is
[1:28:08] his what
[1:28:09] why did brother branham have to point
[1:28:11] the dark beard
[1:28:15] because the preacher that came was the
[1:28:18] picture of off-man the head of jesus
[1:28:22] christ who is the high priest
[1:28:25] look at the beard
[1:28:29] the anointing is coming
[1:28:31] melchizedek is there
[1:28:35] what do you expect the body to receive
[1:28:38] because when it sat on the head
[1:28:41] it's going to go all the way to the body
[1:28:46] everybody
[1:28:48] he have to come in the end time to drop
[1:28:50] that all the way and bring the
[1:28:52] resurrection and but here he said you
[1:28:55] see his dark beer
[1:28:57] dark hair his eyes knows everything just
[1:29:01] water
[1:29:03] and even the part of his hair coming
[1:29:05] over on this side he is who god
[1:29:14] the anointing all that come upon iron
[1:29:17] have something to do
[1:29:19] everybody
[1:29:20] it comes upon a high priest that have
[1:29:22] built there is a reason for it
[1:29:27] and then from there his son also washed
[1:29:30] a cloth with coats
[1:29:33] not holy garment why is the difference
[1:29:35] between these two that's why we're in
[1:29:37] the tabernacle
[1:29:39] buckle up we already left the airport
[1:29:41] hey mark here we were dealing with this
[1:29:44] first layer brother branham said
[1:29:47] he's made the old testament in parable
[1:29:52] in symbolic forms to express himself
[1:29:57] his self and his doings
[1:30:00] that the simpleminded
[1:30:02] might be able to have a conception of
[1:30:05] his will and what he's done
[1:30:08] in other words what god was doing in the
[1:30:11] old testament
[1:30:12] when he told them build me a temple i
[1:30:15] want to live there he was giving
[1:30:18] something he was giving them symbols he
[1:30:21] was giving them form he was giving them
[1:30:23] a message of something he's wanted to do
[1:30:27] everybody
[1:30:28] many times in the old testament
[1:30:31] how i have went back to found the old
[1:30:34] tapping the new
[1:30:36] always god did and what he's doing now
[1:30:39] in the new testament he did what
[1:30:43] he foreshadowed it in the water
[1:30:47] we told you that this tabernacle
[1:30:49] represented christ
[1:30:52] and the temple represented the bride
[1:30:56] everybody here so this tabernacle
[1:31:00] is actually
[1:31:01] foreshadowing jesus christ
[1:31:08] everybody
[1:31:10] let me go
[1:31:11] in the old testament
[1:31:13] being on top of the new the works of the
[1:31:17] inward coats of the tabernacle was a
[1:31:21] beautiful picture of water
[1:31:23] god's plan of water
[1:31:25] for his mankind water
[1:31:27] so what they were doing here in the old
[1:31:30] testament god was showing how he's
[1:31:32] saving man
[1:31:34] that's why we missed god that's why the
[1:31:37] pharisee the jews miss god because they
[1:31:41] never got the revelation of the old
[1:31:43] testament
[1:31:44] amen
[1:31:46] amen
[1:31:47] everybody here
[1:31:48] how can you sing in the temple my god my
[1:31:51] god why have that forsaken me and
[1:31:54] somebody's in the cross singing the same
[1:31:56] thing but you cannot put the two
[1:31:58] together
[1:32:01] how can a crazy man
[1:32:03] stand up there and say behold the lamb
[1:32:06] of god
[1:32:07] why he didn't say behold the man
[1:32:11] he was telling israel everything that
[1:32:13] you are doing there this is the real
[1:32:19] over there it was a lamb
[1:32:21] over here he was so the lamb walked for
[1:32:25] foreshadowing somebody
[1:32:30] hallelujah and if we can only learn by
[1:32:34] this now
[1:32:35] how to get ourself in the condition to
[1:32:39] receive what god has installed for us it
[1:32:42] shall just sweep the whole valley here
[1:32:45] if you understand how god operates
[1:32:48] here
[1:32:49] hallelujah paul says this
[1:32:52] that according to the grace
[1:32:55] of god which is given unto me as a wise
[1:32:59] master builder
[1:33:01] show me which house paul built
[1:33:04] do you have the housing
[1:33:07] do you have a house
[1:33:08] paul was making tent i can give you the
[1:33:11] scripture
[1:33:12] but paul was not building houses what
[1:33:14] kind of houses paul was building
[1:33:17] because in the old testament solomon
[1:33:19] built god the house
[1:33:21] and paul is calling himself him a
[1:33:24] prophet him a preacher he's calling
[1:33:27] himself a master builder show me the
[1:33:30] house paul built
[1:33:31] so what you sow as a house is not really
[1:33:35] her house
[1:33:37] hallelujah
[1:33:38] i have laid the foundation
[1:33:41] and another build of their own but let
[1:33:44] every man take heed how he built their
[1:33:47] own
[1:33:48] they're upon
[1:33:49] for other foundation can no man lay then
[1:33:53] daddy's laid which is who
[1:33:57] how was paul laying jesus christ
[1:34:04] when paul is preaching the word
[1:34:06] paul is calling that i am building
[1:34:10] i am laying a foundation
[1:34:12] [Music]
[1:34:13] here so the tabernacle or the temple the
[1:34:17] way they were doing that naturally now
[1:34:20] it's expressed spiritually
[1:34:25] paul say now if any man built
[1:34:29] upon this foundation which is a man the
[1:34:32] man jesus christ
[1:34:34] upon this foundation how
[1:34:36] how can you put gold and built on jesus
[1:34:38] jesus is a man
[1:34:42] so the gold that you put on jesus is not
[1:34:44] natural gold
[1:34:47] anybody care
[1:34:48] if you build gold
[1:34:50] silver precious stone wood hay stubble
[1:34:54] all of these are natural material
[1:34:58] but paul is showing you that what you
[1:35:00] saw naturally i'm putting that on jesus
[1:35:07] what does god mean
[1:35:09] on jesus what a silver mean on jesus
[1:35:12] what does hay means on jesus what a
[1:35:14] stubble mean on jesus
[1:35:16] and back here
[1:35:18] that's why brother branham say we are
[1:35:20] not building an organization
[1:35:22] i'm not here this morning to build an
[1:35:25] organization christ never sent me to
[1:35:28] build an organization
[1:35:29] christ sent me to build water
[1:35:33] so what they were doing as a house is
[1:35:36] not really a house
[1:35:37] they are building individuals everybody
[1:35:40] individual to the stature of jesus
[1:35:43] christ that there might be the
[1:35:45] powerhouse
[1:35:47] and the dwelling place of the spirit by
[1:35:50] his water
[1:35:52] that same word is bringing the spirit
[1:35:54] that's why every time they took the ark
[1:35:58] and they put it in the tabernacle the
[1:36:01] pillar of fire comes
[1:36:03] the word then the pillar of fire follow
[1:36:05] the word and sit on that word emma
[1:36:09] by his word
[1:36:10] build up the individual to that place
[1:36:13] not built an organization to a greater
[1:36:16] denomination but build the individual to
[1:36:20] sons and daughters of god that is the
[1:36:23] idea
[1:36:24] so whatever was built here
[1:36:28] by moses
[1:36:29] because god was dwelling in the pillar
[1:36:32] of fire and god wanted to dwell among
[1:36:35] his people in the tabernacle this
[1:36:38] material was talking about somebody
[1:36:45] anybody here
[1:36:47] now what to understand that person you
[1:36:51] need to understand the material
[1:36:53] because they material tell you who that
[1:36:56] person is
[1:37:00] we were on the first layer which is the
[1:37:03] final inning
[1:37:05] taught moses met dead curtain
[1:37:08] fine lemon
[1:37:10] blue purple scarlet with caravans all of
[1:37:14] this is called the tabernacle
[1:37:18] the measurement we already know it's 4
[1:37:21] by 28
[1:37:22] because 4 is the number of the earth
[1:37:26] 4 is the number of deliverance
[1:37:28] sin entered by a woman
[1:37:31] sin also must be taken out by a woman
[1:37:33] that's why the 28th circle of a woman
[1:37:36] must be there and on the end time on
[1:37:38] february the 28th
[1:37:40] for 28th minute
[1:37:42] telling you i'm coming again through
[1:37:44] that circle
[1:37:46] anybody care
[1:37:47] but he splitted the grace
[1:37:49] he got five over there and five over
[1:37:52] there and brother branham said now it's
[1:37:54] six times
[1:37:55] all bride time
[1:37:59] the virgin world time no touch
[1:38:03] it's a virgin remember a virgin world
[1:38:07] time
[1:38:08] just as he entered first by mary he have
[1:38:12] to bring another fire by the capstone by
[1:38:15] zero babel another five again for
[1:38:18] another virgin and the end time that's
[1:38:20] why the numbers have to be kept four by
[1:38:23] twenty eight four by twenty eight
[1:38:27] but here but god's church is not touched
[1:38:30] by denomination hallelujah
[1:38:33] it's a virgin born word of god made
[1:38:36] manifested jesus christ the same
[1:38:39] yesterday today and forever there shall
[1:38:41] be no denomination
[1:38:45] manhandling in the virgin birth of the
[1:38:48] blood
[1:38:49] no sir she is commanded by god to come
[1:38:53] out as such
[1:38:54] touch not their unclean things become a
[1:38:57] walter
[1:38:59] there's a virgin in mary
[1:39:00] there is a virgin on the end time
[1:39:03] ever care so far
[1:39:04] we found at the end there is 50 loops
[1:39:08] and 50 loops because the ministry of
[1:39:11] jesus christ started by grace
[1:39:13] at the end he produced 50 pentecost
[1:39:17] they are pouring off the holy spirit but
[1:39:19] the entire ministry of brother branham
[1:39:21] starts with the holy ghost in azusa
[1:39:23] street pentecost then brother branham
[1:39:26] pick it up that's why they have one have
[1:39:28] to be at the end one started from there
[1:39:34] the two are connected with a jubilee
[1:39:37] let's get to this then we let you go
[1:39:39] home
[1:39:41] we saw last sunday that the color blue
[1:39:45] represented the perfect spirit of
[1:39:48] fellowship
[1:39:51] the color
[1:39:52] blue was the perfect spirit
[1:39:58] spirit
[1:40:00] of fellowship
[1:40:02] if we mean fellowship we're talking
[1:40:05] about two fellows
[1:40:08] one ship
[1:40:09] anybody here so somebody want to talk to
[1:40:12] someone
[1:40:13] anybody here but to talk to someone you
[1:40:16] need a spirit
[1:40:18] and back here and that spirit when he
[1:40:21] comes is gonna bring both of those
[1:40:23] person to talk
[1:40:25] because at the beginning they were in
[1:40:27] enmity
[1:40:30] do you hear me
[1:40:32] because number 10 is a corner number and
[1:40:35] to be carnal you are in enmity with god
[1:40:38] ever here so to join you back to god
[1:40:41] because sin came in the garden of eden
[1:40:44] and separated man from god you need a
[1:40:47] blue color
[1:40:54] hallelujah
[1:40:55] and that blue also brother branham said
[1:40:59] that he represents trueness
[1:41:04] anybody here so we can see here
[1:41:07] spirit
[1:41:09] and truth
[1:41:10] in blue
[1:41:14] everybody here
[1:41:15] the bible says you shall not get truth
[1:41:19] anybody here and the troops shall make
[1:41:22] you
[1:41:23] so when you entering in the tabernacle
[1:41:27] the tabernacle which is a person
[1:41:31] that person
[1:41:32] there is a blue color
[1:41:34] telling you that the one who's gonna be
[1:41:37] that tabernacle in that person
[1:41:40] he will have a spirit
[1:41:42] of perfect fellowship
[1:41:44] and a spirit of trueness
[1:41:48] anybody care
[1:41:50] now to move forward to these colors
[1:41:53] brother branham says this that there is
[1:41:56] seven colors yes
[1:41:58] seven churches
[1:42:00] seven is complete and god was complete
[1:42:04] and seven spirit and those spirit where
[1:42:10] are we okay
[1:42:12] stay up he amazes me when you sleep
[1:42:16] amen
[1:42:18] the first was color afraid
[1:42:21] perfect love
[1:42:23] redemption
[1:42:24] keep that in mind
[1:42:26] anybody care
[1:42:28] and how if we had time to give those
[1:42:31] colors and show that each one of those
[1:42:35] colors
[1:42:36] represented gods
[1:42:41] so a color in the bible
[1:42:44] is speaking about the purity of god
[1:42:51] a color
[1:42:53] speak about the purity of god
[1:42:57] purity we're talking about holiness
[1:43:00] that's why you hear the bible say the
[1:43:02] beauty of holiness
[1:43:05] that beauty is by colors
[1:43:07] anybody here
[1:43:09] brother problem say
[1:43:12] those colors
[1:43:13] there is seven natural colors
[1:43:16] those color represented the purity of
[1:43:19] god
[1:43:21] what's going on with the purity of god
[1:43:24] brother branham said god was in the
[1:43:26] beginning
[1:43:28] before there was any light before there
[1:43:30] was ever an atom before there was ever a
[1:43:33] star before there was any visible thing
[1:43:37] god feel all space i already spoke to
[1:43:39] you about this the circle of eternity
[1:43:42] and in death
[1:43:44] was nothing but what
[1:43:49] pure holiness pure righteousness
[1:43:52] he was spirit
[1:43:54] in other words everything that god was
[1:43:57] was pure
[1:43:59] it's about holiness
[1:44:02] that's why the high priest have to put
[1:44:04] something here speaking holiness unto
[1:44:06] the lord
[1:44:08] amen everybody here
[1:44:10] brother branham continued he said those
[1:44:13] colors
[1:44:14] represented the murders of god
[1:44:26] they represented the motive of god
[1:44:29] and they represented the attitude of god
[1:44:34] so when god was telling moses
[1:44:37] take the blue
[1:44:39] take the scarlet take the paper god was
[1:44:43] putting a message
[1:44:45] god was looking at the database of the
[1:44:49] true tabernacle who was jesus christ
[1:44:53] but it was not time yet
[1:44:55] to tell the people who he was
[1:44:57] and god used the material
[1:45:00] because the invisible things of god are
[1:45:03] expressed and they are understood by the
[1:45:06] visible things of god
[1:45:08] everybody
[1:45:09] so when god was telling moses
[1:45:11] put the color here
[1:45:15] those color
[1:45:16] was reflecting the motive of god in
[1:45:20] jesus christ
[1:45:25] the scholar was well representing the
[1:45:28] attitude of god in jesus christ
[1:45:33] those colors were showing the purity of
[1:45:36] god in jesus christ
[1:45:41] so to understand jesus christ you must
[1:45:44] understand the old testament because the
[1:45:47] old testament was a shadow
[1:45:52] what you see as a man walking
[1:45:54] it's a whole tabernacle walking
[1:46:03] says
[1:46:04] that
[1:46:04] a three-corner piece of glass
[1:46:07] yet it's only one piece of glass but in
[1:46:10] three corners we'll reflect seven colors
[1:46:14] i'm not going to go there
[1:46:16] but let me just clear you if you take a
[1:46:18] three corner glass like this you do that
[1:46:20] in alarm and you shine a light here when
[1:46:22] it goes through it's gonna come with
[1:46:24] seven colors that's what brother branham
[1:46:26] is saying there is a message right there
[1:46:28] but let's leave it alone now hey
[1:46:31] brother brother say that's how
[1:46:34] father
[1:46:35] son
[1:46:36] holy ghost
[1:46:38] the three corners
[1:46:39] make sense
[1:46:41] being one
[1:46:43] yet to reflect the seven water
[1:46:47] so the color are also the attribute of
[1:46:51] god
[1:46:55] everybody here
[1:46:57] so when you read blue
[1:46:59] it is telling you something about god
[1:47:02] but it's coded
[1:47:04] when you go in the hospital
[1:47:06] when they say cold blue
[1:47:09] you will be looking and say what is
[1:47:12] called blue
[1:47:13] or who is gold blue the nurse
[1:47:16] understand what it means
[1:47:19] you will see the nurse
[1:47:21] moving a certain way
[1:47:23] because god blew to you is called blue
[1:47:27] but to a nurse there is a message
[1:47:29] telling them maybe there is an emergency
[1:47:32] because if a trumpet gives an uncertain
[1:47:35] son
[1:47:36] you won't know what to do
[1:47:40] everybody here and to decode god you
[1:47:44] need a prophet
[1:47:48] hallelujah
[1:47:50] now
[1:47:51] where we know that blue
[1:47:54] is the perfect spirit of fellowship and
[1:47:57] blue is the spirit of trueness of truth
[1:48:01] we have blue our spirit and water
[1:48:06] in john chapter 4
[1:48:08] verse 23 jesus said but the hour cometh
[1:48:14] and now is that the true worship
[1:48:18] shall worship the father in water
[1:48:22] and in water
[1:48:27] are we okay
[1:48:28] are we okay
[1:48:30] in spirit
[1:48:32] and in truth
[1:48:33] both of them together
[1:48:35] the message is perfectly in line with
[1:48:37] the scripture
[1:48:40] for the father seeking such to do what
[1:48:44] god is looking for worshipping
[1:48:47] god is looking for true worshipping but
[1:48:50] you don't worship god any kind of way
[1:48:53] you gotta understand god in the
[1:48:55] tabernacle in the tabernacle there was a
[1:48:59] blue color
[1:49:04] that is the inside top and alcohol of
[1:49:06] god amen
[1:49:10] he said god is a spirit
[1:49:13] and they that worship him must worship
[1:49:16] him in spirit and in water
[1:49:19] because if you don't have these two
[1:49:22] elements
[1:49:23] how are you gonna come back to
[1:49:24] fellowship
[1:49:26] into the easter coat
[1:49:29] the bible says paul that christ has
[1:49:33] redeemed from the curse of the law
[1:49:36] being made that curse for us
[1:49:39] for it is written curse is everyone that
[1:49:42] hung on the tree he was hung on the
[1:49:44] cross
[1:49:47] why
[1:49:48] the purpose is that
[1:49:50] the blessing of abraham
[1:49:52] might come on the gender
[1:49:55] through jesus christ
[1:49:57] god have a blessing
[1:49:59] he wanted to give to the jews
[1:50:01] the jews rejected that
[1:50:04] and crucified god and because of the
[1:50:06] crucifixion the blessing went to the
[1:50:09] gentile in other words the cross crosses
[1:50:12] the hand of god
[1:50:14] that's why the hand of jacob were close
[1:50:17] to take the blessing of the elder the
[1:50:19] jew and put it on the youngest one
[1:50:22] he took the cross
[1:50:26] ever here
[1:50:28] he said that we might receive the
[1:50:30] promise of the weapon
[1:50:33] through what
[1:50:36] hallelujah we look here let me skip this
[1:50:41] we look here in second corinthians the
[1:50:44] bible say
[1:50:46] all things are of god
[1:50:48] who has reconciles
[1:50:51] himself by jesus christ
[1:50:54] and have given to us the ministry of
[1:50:58] reconciliation
[1:51:00] reconciliation meaning to bring you back
[1:51:02] again something happened
[1:51:05] that broke the fellowship
[1:51:07] you need somebody to pull the thing
[1:51:09] together
[1:51:10] to reconcile to bring the fellowship
[1:51:14] back again and that person is trust and
[1:51:17] he was expressing the old testament in a
[1:51:20] blue color
[1:51:24] to which that god was in christ
[1:51:31] in other words christ
[1:51:32] was a house
[1:51:35] christ was a temple
[1:51:37] he said he saw this temple christ was a
[1:51:40] tabernacle and god entered into that
[1:51:43] tabernacle
[1:51:45] and he took that tabernacle to bring you
[1:51:48] close to god just like the old
[1:51:50] tabernacle that god dwell into it but
[1:51:54] that tabernacle must have a material
[1:51:56] that reflected jesus christ
[1:52:00] here
[1:52:01] reconciling the world unto himself
[1:52:04] not imputing their trespasses unto them
[1:52:08] and has committed unto us the word of
[1:52:11] water
[1:52:12] so when god
[1:52:14] said that their true worship must
[1:52:17] worship god in truth
[1:52:19] which is the word and the spirit ever
[1:52:23] once you are baptized with the holy
[1:52:26] ghost you are carrying the blue color of
[1:52:29] god and you also can bring that color to
[1:52:33] somebody and the sinner can be
[1:52:35] reconciled back to god
[1:52:40] everybody here
[1:52:41] the second color is the scarlet color
[1:52:48] we okay
[1:52:53] praise god
[1:52:56] everybody here i don't have to bend
[1:53:00] isaiah 1 verse 18
[1:53:03] the bible say come now and let us reason
[1:53:06] together say the lord
[1:53:08] do your sin be as water
[1:53:14] so scarlet
[1:53:15] represent your sins
[1:53:26] is the tabernacle complicated
[1:53:29] through the opening of the seven seal
[1:53:32] the bible becoming you

[1:53:51] to
[1:53:52] snow
[1:53:54] anybody care
[1:53:56] hallelujah
[1:53:58] to snow
[1:54:00] because what they're looking by snow
[1:54:03] is the white color
[1:54:05] which is
[1:54:06] purity amen
[1:54:09] somebody's sinner
[1:54:11] he's not pure we need to bring him back
[1:54:14] to purity because we came from god
[1:54:18] thought they were red
[1:54:26] what is going on brother branham
[1:54:28] red
[1:54:30] we always thinks
[1:54:32] the red is danger
[1:54:35] signified danger
[1:54:37] or a life or so forth
[1:54:40] but read in the scripture signify
[1:54:44] redemption

[2:11:35] and of the
[2:11:36] water so righteousness is a gift
[2:11:42] amen
[2:11:43] righteousness where am i at
[2:11:45] righteousness
[2:11:47] righteousness
[2:11:48] according to the scripture
[2:11:51] righteousness is a gift
[2:11:55] do you earn a gift
[2:11:58] no no no
[2:12:00] it is only
[2:12:02] anybody care
[2:12:04] paul continued and the gift of
[2:12:07] righteousness
[2:12:08] shall reign in life by one
[2:12:11] who
[2:12:12] that's why the temple must be in fine
[2:12:14] linen
[2:12:16] telling you the one who is coming the
[2:12:18] one i'm gonna dwell in him
[2:12:21] to be able to dwell among humans he will
[2:12:24] have blue
[2:12:25] but that blue that i gave in the
[2:12:27] tabernacle it's only a signal to tell
[2:12:30] you i will fill him with the spirit
[2:12:32] that scarlet is to tell you he's the one
[2:12:34] that is bringing your redemption that
[2:12:37] fun lana needs to tell you not only the
[2:12:39] redemption but also in him he have a
[2:12:43] gift for you and that gift is the gift
[2:12:45] of righteousness
[2:12:47] everybody
[2:12:48] paul said therefore as by the offense of
[2:12:51] one
[2:12:52] judgment came upon all men to
[2:12:54] condemnation
[2:12:55] even so by the righteousness of one
[2:12:59] the free gift
[2:13:01] come upon all men
[2:13:03] unto justification of what
[2:13:06] for us by one man
[2:13:08] disobedience many were made sin so by
[2:13:12] the obedience of one man
[2:13:14] shall many me bread water
[2:13:18] [Music]
[2:13:19] it is important
[2:13:21] to remember
[2:13:22] that before you enter into the inner
[2:13:25] coat
[2:13:26] the king himself
[2:13:28] must give you the golden scepter
[2:13:31] everybody
[2:13:33] so that righteousness
[2:13:35] cannot be by anybody
[2:13:38] it must be somebody who is a king
[2:13:41] anybody here
[2:13:43] brother branham said this
[2:13:46] that scarlett
[2:13:48] also represented royal
[2:13:56] hallelujah
[2:13:58] brother branham says scarlet
[2:14:00] also represented royo
[2:14:06] hallelujah
[2:14:07] he said the scarlet the colors call it
[2:14:10] means red he said what does the word
[2:14:13] scarlet detect
[2:14:15] it detects royalty
[2:14:17] [Music]
[2:14:19] in other words the one that is coming
[2:14:22] is not just a human being
[2:14:24] it is the king himself
[2:14:27] that's why they were calling him where
[2:14:29] is the king of the
[2:14:33] we have stealing his star we are coming
[2:14:35] to the water
[2:14:37] to worship a king
[2:14:41] everybody here
[2:14:43] brother branham also say
[2:14:45] that he detect royalty
[2:14:48] royal royal royal see the king
[2:14:51] and why are we not a denomination
[2:14:54] brother branham said that the woman was
[2:14:57] arrayed in purple
[2:14:59] which means what
[2:15:00] [Music]
[2:15:03] brother branham says
[2:15:05] that
[2:15:07] royal
[2:15:09] royal
[2:15:11] is both purple
[2:15:13] and scarlet
[2:15:18] where did you get that brother brother
[2:15:20] did he give you a scripture
[2:15:23] and they strip him
[2:15:26] and they put on him
[2:15:33] and when they had plated a crown
[2:15:39] of water
[2:15:43] so they were crowning jesus as a king
[2:15:47] ever here
[2:15:49] but instead of them
[2:15:51] putting a normal true crown on him
[2:15:55] they were mocking him
[2:15:59] everybody
[2:16:00] but they were not really mocking him
[2:16:05] everybody care
[2:16:06] because the crown they put on him
[2:16:09] was the crown of thorn
[2:16:12] [Music]
[2:16:14] everybody
[2:16:16] because when he came as a king
[2:16:19] you follow me
[2:16:20] in his first coming he's coming as a
[2:16:24] king redemption
[2:16:27] as a king redeemer
[2:16:29] ever here he cannot wear his true crown
[2:16:35] do you follow me
[2:16:36] it is when he come in revelation 19
[2:16:41] ever here that is coming as a choking
[2:16:45] with all his power
[2:16:49] do you follow me
[2:16:51] but as he comes from redemption
[2:16:54] he must have a crown
[2:16:56] but in redemption is to bring somebody
[2:16:59] back
[2:17:00] to what they're falling
[2:17:02] because he's coming with the scarlet
[2:17:04] color
[2:17:05] hey
[2:17:06] because when adam if sin
[2:17:09] adam came
[2:17:11] and adam detected and he looked he said
[2:17:14] if god comes he's going to kill my wife
[2:17:18] everybody here
[2:17:19] and he's going to left me alone
[2:17:21] but i only remember when they created me
[2:17:24] there was only one woman
[2:17:26] and she was part of me i cannot lose her
[2:17:30] so adam deliberately
[2:17:33] we will get to that
[2:17:34] down the road
[2:17:36] deliberately he did what was wrong
[2:17:43] because adam was in the image of god
[2:17:47] that's why the bible said now man has
[2:17:49] become like one of us brother branham
[2:17:52] said watch he never say woman become
[2:17:54] only men that was adam and berkia
[2:17:58] so when god came
[2:18:00] he looked adam
[2:18:03] because eve also have the name of adam
[2:18:07] when god looked at adam
[2:18:09] he was supposed to strike adam
[2:18:12] but when god looked at adam
[2:18:14] it's him
[2:18:16] he can't kill his own son
[2:18:20] hey
[2:18:22] in other words he took a whooping he
[2:18:24] looks
[2:18:27] [Music]
[2:18:29] ever clear
[2:18:30] ever here
[2:18:35] i don't care so when god look at adam
[2:18:39] adam say it is the woman that you gave
[2:18:42] me
[2:18:43] you know what i did right
[2:18:45] i knew it was wrong but i did it so i
[2:18:48] can save her
[2:18:49] god look
[2:18:51] he look
[2:18:53] and and the wrath of god
[2:18:55] is still burning
[2:18:57] god had to put a raft somewhere
[2:19:01] [Applause]
[2:19:04] do you know where
[2:19:06] he took the raft and he slammed it on
[2:19:09] the floor
[2:19:10] he said cross videogram
[2:19:16] ever here
[2:19:17] he said you ground
[2:19:20] turn will come out of you
[2:19:28] do you know that scripture
[2:19:30] do you know that scripture
[2:19:31] how many knows the scriptures

[2:19:35] do you know the scripture
[2:19:38] ever here he struck it on the earth
[2:19:42] and the earth brought tone
[2:19:44] so when he's coming
[2:19:46] as king we demon
[2:19:49] they have to remove the curse
[2:19:53] [Applause]
[2:20:00] [Applause]
[2:20:02] hallelujah
[2:20:04] is he delicious
[2:20:06] hallelujah they have to take the curse
[2:20:10] the curse over there and put on him
[2:20:14] as a crown
[2:20:17] they were not mocking him
[2:20:20] modern events are made clear by
[2:20:26] the scarlet robe
[2:20:28] with the curse of the earth
[2:20:32] [Applause]
[2:20:40] hallelujah
[2:20:42] do you know that curse was made hard on
[2:20:44] who
[2:20:46] on the job of adam
[2:20:48] that's why when you're going through a
[2:20:50] hard job

[2:21:57] hallelujah
[2:21:59] i'm still okay on time
[2:22:01] amen
[2:22:02] he said when they read on his right hand
[2:22:06] why did they give him a read
[2:22:09] because a king must have ah
[2:22:16] everybody
[2:22:17] a creed on his right hand and they bow
[2:22:20] their knee before him and mock him
[2:22:22] saying what yeah
[2:22:25] do you see why brother branham said
[2:22:27] scarlett means king
[2:22:30] but brother branham say also purple
[2:22:32] in john the bible said they planted a
[2:22:36] crown of tongue
[2:22:37] and put it on his hand and they put the
[2:22:40] water
[2:22:42] which one is true
[2:22:45] [Music]
[2:22:48] [Applause]
[2:22:50] do you believe the bible
[2:22:52] [Applause]
[2:22:55] brother branham say here brother branham
[2:22:57] say here it is different tell me which
[2:23:00] one say the truth
[2:23:02] but forever
[2:23:04] [Applause]
[2:23:11] [Music]
[2:23:17] purple king by scarlett
[2:23:21] why a king
[2:23:23] why a king
[2:23:26] why a king
[2:23:27] why royal hallelujah jesus said for i
[2:23:31] say unto you that except your water
[2:23:36] shall exceed the water
[2:23:39] after
[2:23:44] so there is two righteousness
[2:23:53] hallelujah
[2:23:54] there is two righteousness my friend
[2:23:57] there is a righteousness by religion
[2:24:02] [Music]
[2:24:06] there is a righteousness
[2:24:10] by religion
[2:24:12] which is covering
[2:24:15] amen
[2:24:16] that's why adam put the fig tree
[2:24:19] but he was still hiding before god how
[2:24:22] can you be covered and hide so he knew
[2:24:25] that righteousness could not stand
[2:24:26] before god and mark here and there is a
[2:24:30] righteousness
[2:24:31] that is by christ
[2:24:35] here
[2:24:36] hallelujah he said accept the
[2:24:39] righteousness
[2:24:41] your righteousness exceed the
[2:24:43] righteousness of the scripture and the
[2:24:45] pharisees
[2:24:46] that's what grass found
[2:24:48] ye shall in no case enter into the
[2:24:51] kingdom of god
[2:24:53] their law
[2:24:54] was not
[2:24:56] enough
[2:24:57] to put somebody into the presence
[2:25:00] so king muscam
[2:25:02] in royal and in purple in scarlet and in
[2:25:07] purple and fine lemon all of them mixed
[2:25:10] together
[2:25:11] and right here to bring you a
[2:25:14] righteousness that is higher than the
[2:25:17] righteousness of the law
[2:25:23] hallelujah
[2:25:24] that's why paul said for being ignorant
[2:25:28] the jews being ignorant of god's water
[2:25:33] and going about to establish their own
[2:25:35] water
[2:25:36] they have not submitted themself unto
[2:25:39] the righteousness of god
[2:25:41] so when jesus christ was coming he was
[2:25:44] the fine land and in flesh
[2:25:46] telling them i am your righteousness
[2:25:49] but the jews didn't want that they want
[2:25:52] their own righteousness and he said
[2:25:55] listen if the righteousness that i'm
[2:25:57] giving you if the righteousness you have
[2:25:59] is not higher than that you cannot enter
[2:26:02] in heaven
[2:26:05] ever here
[2:26:06] that's why all the old testament
[2:26:10] said when they die they went to paradise
[2:26:13] nobody saw god
[2:26:18] because the righteousness that was
[2:26:20] coming from the law
[2:26:22] was not enough for them to enter
[2:26:26] because he was under the blood of god
[2:26:28] balls and goats
[2:26:31] everybody
[2:26:33] oh my god
[2:26:35] the bible said in genesis 49
[2:26:38] that deception shall not depart from who
[2:26:44] which crowd did jesus came out
[2:26:49] why does he have to come from judah
[2:26:53] because he must
[2:26:54] drop from judah
[2:26:56] and go in judah and say give me the
[2:26:58] scepter
[2:27:00] he belongs to me
[2:27:03] he have to enter judah to pick up the
[2:27:06] royalty
[2:27:08] to take it away from israel
[2:27:12] anybody here
[2:27:14] now i can put whoever i want
[2:27:17] where the jew or gentle
[2:27:20] if i stretch the septum
[2:27:23] they're going to enter the holy holy
[2:27:26] anybody here
[2:27:27] he said no the lord given from between
[2:27:31] his feet until shalom come
[2:27:35] so when shallow come the scepter will
[2:27:38] depart from judah
[2:27:40] he will move out of judah
[2:27:43] before shallow depth it could stand
[2:27:46] and eat the bread
[2:27:49] and tell the people you're not priests
[2:27:50] follow me
[2:27:53] but you are not david do you know
[2:27:56] follow me you're hungry right two
[2:27:59] choices either you die or you eat
[2:28:02] get the bread eat
[2:28:05] i'm still alive you need some more
[2:28:09] david you're telling them there is
[2:28:11] somebody coming up from judah
[2:28:13] [Music]
[2:28:15] and that man
[2:28:17] even though he's not under the levitical
[2:28:19] priesthood he can enter in the
[2:28:22] tabernacle
[2:28:23] and take stuff
[2:28:25] and god you call god you say god look at
[2:28:27] him
[2:28:29] god turn around and say
[2:28:31] god look at him say you don't understand
[2:28:34] who's taking the stuff he said number
[2:28:36] they say i shall see him but not now i
[2:28:40] shall behold him but not now they shall
[2:28:42] come a star out of jacob
[2:28:45] an acceptance shall rise out of israel
[2:28:50] that scepter now is not a reader it's a
[2:28:54] person
[2:28:55] everybody here
[2:28:58] paul say
[2:28:59] but unto the son he say that throne
[2:29:03] oh god
[2:29:05] is forever
[2:29:06] and ever acceptor of what
[2:29:14] is the scepter of what
[2:29:18] that's why
[2:29:19] esther said there is only one law
[2:29:22] if i enter there it's death
[2:29:25] but i'm gonna enter because that husband
[2:29:28] there is my husband
[2:29:30] and when he get there when he look at
[2:29:32] esther
[2:29:34] bring me the scepter
[2:29:38] [Music]
[2:29:42] ever here
[2:29:44] enter
[2:29:45] enter
[2:29:46] amanda it's a royal scepter that's why
[2:29:50] paul said for he has made him to be sin
[2:29:53] for us
[2:29:54] him who knew not sin that we might be
[2:29:57] made the water
[2:29:59] now you have the right to enter god
[2:30:05] oh my god philippians said that i might
[2:30:09] be found in him
[2:30:11] not having my own water
[2:30:14] in other words when you enter god grab
[2:30:17] jesus with you
[2:30:20] hallelujah which is the law but that
[2:30:23] which is through what
[2:30:26] of christ the righteousness which is of
[2:30:30] god by what
[2:30:32] but of him
[2:30:34] are ye in christ jesus
[2:30:36] who of god is made unto us what
[2:30:41] jesus is your wisdom and what
[2:30:45] jesus is your righteousness and what
[2:30:48] jesus is your sanctification then water
[2:30:52] that's why the color must be mingled
[2:30:54] together the red the purple and then and
[2:30:57] then they have to put it together it's
[2:30:58] one person
[2:31:02] hallelujah
[2:31:03] let's get purple
[2:31:05] and we can stop here the caribbeans will
[2:31:07] pick it up next time
[2:31:09] hallelujah
[2:31:10] brother branham say that we realize that
[2:31:13] the odd lord
[2:31:14] was that a son was born in home he was a
[2:31:18] son but the tutor raised him and then
[2:31:21] when he was of age if he beat the right
[2:31:24] kind of son he was taken out put air
[2:31:29] on a ceremony and water
[2:31:32] so purple also means adoption
[2:31:36] amen
[2:31:40] so the man who's coming is your wisdom
[2:31:44] is your righteousness is your
[2:31:46] sanctification he's your scholar he's
[2:31:49] your holy ghost he's your truth
[2:31:52] because jesus said i am the way the
[2:31:54] truth
[2:31:56] i am my father
[2:32:03] hallelujah and that is what he is trying
[2:32:05] to do to these full gospel people now to
[2:32:08] get them out to themselves somewhere
[2:32:11] along with you in faith to adopt them
[2:32:15] into the kingdom and give them the right
[2:32:18] to go forth
[2:32:20] [Music]
[2:32:21] purple
[2:32:22] is also your adoption
[2:32:24] jesus paul says
[2:32:26] for ye have not received the spirit of
[2:32:30] bondage
[2:32:32] [Music]
[2:32:35] everybody
[2:32:37] again to feel
[2:32:39] like esther they're gonna kill me
[2:32:42] no more but you have received the spirit
[2:32:45] of what
[2:32:47] that same spirit that is coming up is
[2:32:50] built into him with adoption
[2:32:54] hallelujah whereby we cry our
[2:32:59] father
[2:33:00] the spirit itself bearing witness with
[2:33:04] our spirit we're gonna see that later
[2:33:07] how your spirit and his spirit are
[2:33:09] talking amen that we are the children of
[2:33:13] god if children then heals
[2:33:16] health of god and don't have with who
[2:33:20] that's where your purple is coming from
[2:33:22] if so be that we suffer with him that we
[2:33:25] may also we glorify together
[2:33:30] galatians because he are son
[2:33:34] god has sent forth the spirit of his son
[2:33:38] in your water
[2:33:39] crying water
[2:33:44] wherefore there are no more servants
[2:33:49] but a water
[2:33:51] and if a son then an heir of god through
[2:33:54] who
[2:33:55] [Music]
[2:33:57] oh my god
[2:33:58] brother branham says this
[2:34:00] after you are adopted all right
[2:34:03] after you are adopted you are placed
[2:34:06] then you understand after the ceremony
[2:34:08] said and you have been put into the body
[2:34:10] correctly you are a sun sure
[2:34:13] and a daughter when you are born again
[2:34:16] you are that that is your birth but now
[2:34:19] you are positionally placed so not only
[2:34:23] is he bringing the blue color
[2:34:25] to baptize you to give you the holy
[2:34:28] spirit to bring you imperfect fellowship
[2:34:30] back to reconcile you back to god
[2:34:33] amen
[2:34:35] he's also building you up so he can also
[2:34:38] adopt you
[2:34:42] everybody here
[2:34:43] we receive not the spirit of fear but we
[2:34:46] receive the spirit of adoption whereby
[2:34:49] we cry our
[2:34:51] father which means my god that's why
[2:34:54] jesus was saying my god my god why have
[2:34:57] they forsaken me
[2:35:00] abba abba
[2:35:04] hallelujah
[2:35:05] we know that the grace
[2:35:08] was spread into 2-5
[2:35:11] we have the first five
[2:35:12] and the second five and when he come on
[2:35:15] the first five he brought the purple
[2:35:17] with him
[2:35:18] adoption
[2:35:19] when he comes here they gotta be
[2:35:21] adoption
[2:35:22] how was his adoption here
[2:35:25] the bible say after six days
[2:35:30] so it must be
[2:35:35] it might be the seventh day oh no
[2:35:37] brother stephen i can argue that after
[2:35:39] six days maybe seven
[2:35:41] maybe eight maybe nine maybe ten right
[2:35:44] so we need to
[2:35:46] narrow our window let's narrow that
[2:35:49] amen after six days jesus taken peter
[2:35:53] german jones his brother and bring them
[2:35:55] up into a high mountain empire and one
[2:35:58] strange figure before them and his first
[2:36:00] did sun shine as the sun and his remnant
[2:36:04] white as the light
[2:36:06] while he had speaking behold a bright
[2:36:09] cloud of a shadow
[2:36:11] and a voice out of the cloud say this is
[2:36:14] my beloved son in whom i am where please
[2:36:17] so the adoption under the first grace
[2:36:20] came up in a mountain
[2:36:24] with a cloud
[2:36:26] and a voice
[2:36:32] anybody here
[2:36:34] now we say after six days somebody argue
[2:36:37] with me i can say nine
[2:36:39] i can say ten
[2:36:41] in luke chapter nine verse twenty eight
[2:36:44] the bible say and it came to pass a bad
[2:36:48] next day so no more none
[2:36:51] no more 10.
[2:36:54] so we have between
[2:36:57] six
[2:36:58] end of six
[2:36:59] and about
[2:37:01] eight
[2:37:02] not eight not six
[2:37:06] so there is only one number left
[2:37:09] [Applause]
[2:37:14] this message
[2:37:16] is crushed
[2:37:18] hallelujah
[2:37:20] so no more arguing
[2:37:22] which number is it
[2:37:25] seven
[2:37:26] seven is after six
[2:37:29] anybody here
[2:37:30] but they say
[2:37:32] about the east
[2:37:34] so it must not be in the morning
[2:37:40] [Applause]
[2:37:41] [Music]
[2:37:42] [Applause]
[2:37:45] hallelujah
[2:37:46] it must be in the evening
[2:37:49] [Music]
[2:37:50] [Applause]
[2:37:51] [Music]
[2:37:52] so the adoption happened under the first
[2:37:56] five
[2:37:57] after on the seventh day at the evening
[2:38:01] time
[2:38:02] that's why in this end time on coronado

[2:38:15] time on the seven church edges that's
[2:38:18] when the cloud comes

[2:39:44] cloud cloud cloud cloud cloud and they
[2:39:46] keep attacking them
[2:39:48] or everything even the the vision of
[2:39:52] brother branham our scripture
[2:39:54] it didn't happen by any chance
