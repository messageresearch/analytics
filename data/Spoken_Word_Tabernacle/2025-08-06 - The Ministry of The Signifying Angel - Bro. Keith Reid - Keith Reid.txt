And then until until we see her after service. Amen. I know it's summer. folks are moving around and things, but uh by God's grace, little by little, they're coming back home and uh see us. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So, just uh be cautious on the ground there. You see what's going on. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; If you want to keep your shoes clean, so just stay away from there. Amen. That's a tremendous work that was done for just renting the equipment only. Everything that you see zero dollar and sister Edie, [Laughter] she doesn't want me to say, but I have to say it. They have to work all day and we didn't even ask for it. &gt;&gt; But she just cooked meal and brought meal to the one that was working here. You see how God is working? I told brother John, but I say I have to say it. Thank you very much. That's the moving of the Holy Spirit because when I call, I say, "You're still working. Did you get something?" They say, "Yes, sister. You did eat some good sandwiches. They taste so good. They were good." So, I'm the one who missed the sandwiches. But it's okay. I was about to drive after work to come. They say no, no, brother Robert say everything is okay. You don't have to come here. All is well by God's grace. Amen. So you keep praying over there. The door are already locked. We're working on the lock. So probably you won't have your um special visit because we are locking the building there. Things the AC is working everything is almost there. So we will be packing stuff there. So uh you might need brother set or me to go inside. So just or you might have to wait till the place is uh well furnished and everything. Amen. I'm sorry. I know you got used to going there and looking but we got to we got to a point where we have to lock everything now. So just give us some little bit of time and we see what to do. You heard the trustee saying amen there. So I can't I can't I can't jump over the trustee. He's he's blocking it. So you negotiate with him and be nice to him and uh he will work you through. Amen. &gt;&gt; So keep praying because God is working. He's moving with us in a miraculous way by his grace. Amen. &gt;&gt; We doing this thing with faith. &gt;&gt; We don't have the money for the foundation, but we we we just went and the place &gt;&gt; the money will come. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, if you don't have faith, the contractor have more faith than probably some of you. &gt;&gt; The contractor I'm working with, they they have more faith than more. I called the contractor. I said, "Listen, man. This is a small church and we don't have the money for the foundation yet." So, he said, "Pastor, don't worry about it. We will work things up. We will make it happen." &gt;&gt; And do you know what And do you know what he did? I'm trying to slow him down. He says, "No, I'm going to order the rebar that goes there." &gt;&gt; I say, "Okay, he's ordering the rebar. We need money." I I let it go because I'm not the one driving everything. God is the one building this church. Amen. Amen. You know, I was uh uh talking to my children last night. We were going through Ephesians, too. And I was trying to explain them faith. And then in their school, we usually pay for food. So, you pay for food and then you have to pay every month. If not, you got to pack food. So, you got to pay for it. And then they have to go there and they call your name and you go get food because they're using outside vendors. So, you got to pay actually me and it's uh it's expensive and things. So, uh, I told them, I say, "When you go to school, when I told you I paid for your school, uh, meal," I say, "When you go to school, how do you know you're going to get the food?" &gt;&gt; They say, "Because you pay for it." &gt;&gt; I say, "How do you know?" I say, "Do you have a proof that I pay for it?" &gt;&gt; Your word. &gt;&gt; They took my word. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Do you see how simple they go? When I'm trying to avoid preaching because when I begin to talk to them, Ephesians 2 open up to me. I begin to see things differently. I say, "Oh my god, this is a whole sermon here." And I told them, I say, "What about if you go, I say, when you go there to go get your food, what happened?" &gt;&gt; They say, "They call you by name." [Applause] &gt;&gt; I said, "So your name was written where?" And then my daughter say before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; I said, "What about if your friend tells you that you know what they're not going to give you food?" I said, "Would you believe it?" They say, "No." I said, "If you believe it, what happened?" He say, "You are denying what daddy say." [Music] &gt;&gt; I I said, "So basically, when you go grab food, do you know if the teacher will say yes or no?" They don't even care about it. &gt;&gt; I said that is what faith is. &gt;&gt; I said that's the same thing when Jesus paid the price on Calvary. &gt;&gt; Everything was already paid there &gt;&gt; and whatever Jesus say by his word. We just believe it and we minding what he says and we are acting moving by faith &gt;&gt; and knowing that God will honor his word and we have trust. And I read the scripture. The Bible say if you wicked, &gt;&gt; you know how to give good gift to your children. &gt;&gt; How much more your heavenly father &gt;&gt; will give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him. &gt;&gt; Brother, the gospel is very simple. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Very simple. I'm going to refrain myself from uh preaching because you are now understand the relationship of an ant and the creator. God want to lead you yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know God is digging into avenues we never even thought. But all of that he sent his word so that his word will heal us. It's a word for healing our finances, healing our marriages, healing our job, healing our everything that we have, our school, everything. God is coming down and bringing healing everywhere. Amen. I am not preaching tonight. The one who's preaching is brother Keith Reed from Jamaica. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ah, &gt;&gt; this is a surprise in the middle of the week. Amen. Amen. So, Brother Keef, it's almost 30 years now. He's going to have 30 years of being a pastor. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So, I told him, I said, "Brother Keith, people know you. You preach like home &gt;&gt; and we will pull like home." &gt;&gt; Amen. One thing I forgot to tell him is Wednesday is our convention. And also whenever you get a chance, don't forget brother Joe Green have a meeting there. So whenever you can, let's support the meeting. It will end up actually on Friday. Amen. So let's pull on the gift of the Lord and good to see everybody. If I forgot someone, God richly bless you. Let's go with only believe forever. Oh believe. Oh, they believe all of him are impossible. [Music] All he believe [Music] was you. Oh, [Music] I believe. Oh, I believe all things are. Oh, I believe [Music] I believe you Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many love him tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. We certainly just thank God for his care and his mercies towards us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thanking us for thanking him for foring us this privilege &gt;&gt; of being in his house. One more time. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Um I was thinking as I was coming that Gastonia means so much to me. &gt;&gt; You know this was my first place in the US that I I came I preach &gt;&gt; and uh that is many many years ago. Um, I was just a young evangelist. And then to think that this year I was I I came back from Africa in Easter and they had uh planned behind me, you know, the celebration of my 30th year of pastoring and it seems just like yesterday. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. But we I'm glad to see the faces. um the dear friends and family to us really you know brother Daly and the family sister um Bridgetette um you know and so brother Falby and just the different ones really that we go back so far. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. But we thank God &gt;&gt; for what he has been doing. Amen. &gt;&gt; And what he will continue to do &gt;&gt; we we thank God for your pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I was telling him that um I I was in Camos um Kenya and um when when they tell me of the place that I was supposed to go, I I found it on Google and I realized that I'm actually going into the forest. And so here I was in the forest and I I I get there, I didn't know anybody, but somebody came to me and said, "I I know you because when you preach for brother Shimbo, I I heard you preach. So I I I tell him now you you got to be careful &gt;&gt; because uh you you know sometimes you think that you're just conducting things in your own little local church, &gt;&gt; but there's somebody way off in the forest somewhere &gt;&gt; that is taking instructions from you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. But but we thank God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And while I was there, you know, from our home church in Jamaica, there was a group from Kissy, Kenya, which they said they were 8 hours from Kamosi. And um when I get to Campala, I sent the funds to invite them up to the convention and they were there and they were not even yet message believers. They were just listening to the message from, you know, our church really. And and so we packed them with the food. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; You know, you know, and and put them on the bus and send them back, you know, there. I I'm I'm constantly in touch with them. The brothers have gone down to them really and one by one. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because you you you know how long we're going to be here until the last one. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Receive the revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And one thing I find that uh you know sometimes there's many who had believed they've come out they've believed that God has sent a prophet but that's not all that we believe. &gt;&gt; You you know we believe that the lamb had take the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when he took the book the book was closed but he opened the book. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he released the seals. &gt;&gt; Amen. A and the seals were on the outside, but there was something inside. Seven thunders giving the bride rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Because until we catch all of that revelation, we are still going to be on this side. &gt;&gt; But but we got to leave out of here. &gt;&gt; Amen. In a mount Zion rapture showdown. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So, we'd like to go to the word. I'd like to Amen. You know, Lord, give me just this inspiration. something I was uh speaking back at home and it hit me so hard. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You know, and this week I I you know, as I was at the meetings there in Ruth, North Carolina and you ought to visit sometimes. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Um this is the 52nd year of the missionary convention in Ruth, North Carolina. &gt;&gt; And that's a meeting like no other because the focus of that meeting is to um you know build churches all over the world. And so last year I was in um Uganda and in the eastern region there was 10 churches that we were being built and um you know I had a chance to go and to see the structure see what the brothers are doing with you know the funds that was sent to them and so because it's all right to bring people to the message but to find somewhere for them to you know gather together and to feel that sense you know like you're now building a church and um you know you you bought a church but now you're adding to it and there's going to be things that you do yourself and you feel a part of it really that that's a part of the experience you know I remember back home in Jamaica we were building a church and you know we had the they laugh at us because there was one time there was nine sisters that was pregnant you know and they were passing the bucket with the martr and all of that really but you know we thank God for those experience really you know to today we can reach out to others and we understand the experience amen praise Praise God. So we we thank God we're a family together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Let us just bow our heads before we go to the scriptures. Oh heavenly father and oh God. Father we thank you God for this privilege of being in your house Lord God. And to Lord see people of like precious faith uh that speak oh God an eternal language oh God by the angel of the covenant for this day. Father, we thank you, Lord God, that Lord, we're no longer grouping in darkness, but Lord God, you've sent a light in the healing time. And Lord God, we have come to that light, God, and realize that this is a special moment when Lord God, though, the world is going into another direction, but Lord, we are gathering rapturing faith for a rapture to get out of here. Oh God, Father, we pray that you give us strength. Help us to move us out of the way that you might be glorified behind skin. &gt;&gt; Have thine own way with us. Remember the sick and the afflicted and the downcast. Lord God, Lord, may we say like Jude, let the weak say that I'm strong in the Lord. Have thy way as we look to you and believe you. &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; And amen. I'd like to read first from uh Revelation chapter one. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And uh I read verse one. You can keep your Bibles open as we go through the scriptures. And I'm going to read from Joel chapter 2 as we go on. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The I want us to just examine the scriptures carefully as we read it, not just to, you know, go over it quickly. It says, "The revelation of Jesus Christ." That's right. which God gave unto him &gt;&gt; to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass. &gt;&gt; And he sent and signify it by his angel. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Singular unto his servant John. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. May the Lord add his blessing to the reading of the word. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Amen. I &gt;&gt; I'm going to speak on the sign the the ministry of the signifying angel. &gt;&gt; You know this is not the revelation of John. &gt;&gt; It is a revelation of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; But I want you to notice the way that it came to John &gt;&gt; because brother Brandham said that John represent the bride. And I want to bring you into the period of time &gt;&gt; that this revelation came forth. Is that right? &gt;&gt; The the Bible said it's a revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him. &gt;&gt; Now Jesus is a morpher of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is a word made flesh. &gt;&gt; Are you there with me? &gt;&gt; Is the image of the invisible God. So we say clearly that Jesus Christ is God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So God was making himself plain. Hallelujah. And he's going to bring it to his servant John. But God selected an angel &gt;&gt; to signify it really. And that is very important. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because uh there in verse 70, the Bible says, "And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. &gt;&gt; And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, fear not. &gt;&gt; I am the first &gt;&gt; and the last." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I'm alive forever more. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And as a key of hell and death. &gt;&gt; Now the book of revelation we find that sometimes the lamb himself speak &gt;&gt; but sometimes the signifying angel was speaking. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, before we go any further, I'd like to show you in position exactly where he was. &gt;&gt; Now, look at verse 10. He said, "And I was in the spirit &gt;&gt; on the Lord's day." &gt;&gt; It was a thousand years. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; John was actually in the vision. &gt;&gt; Are you there with me? &gt;&gt; And he said, "And I heard behind me Not in front of me. &gt;&gt; I heard behind me. &gt;&gt; Very important. Amen. A great voice as of a trumpet. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to show you that where John was, he said, the voice of the trumpet was behind me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And it says, I am alpha and omega. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. the first and the last. &gt;&gt; Now verse 12 says, "And I turn to see." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So if John was like this, uh, I heard a voice where? Not beside me, not in front of me, but behind me. And so John said, "I turn to see the voice." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. you you've got to get it in position is right or else you miss the picture. &gt;&gt; So I turned to see the voice behind me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory and being and I turned to see the voice be hallelujah that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlestick. &gt;&gt; That's right. Now the Bible go on to tell us what the seven golden candlestick is. It's a seven church &gt;&gt; and there were seven stars. &gt;&gt; But where was it? &gt;&gt; It was behind him. &gt;&gt; So it mean that John had gone before. &gt;&gt; Then let us turn to Revelation 4 and verse one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah somebody. Oh, you just pray for me this tonight. He said, "And after this." &gt;&gt; Now, you know that the church ages was Revelation 2 &gt;&gt; and Revelation 3. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But in Revelation chapter 4 and one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And and after this I look after what? After the ages. &gt;&gt; After the church age. After let us &gt;&gt; after it passed through Leosia, &gt;&gt; after I was called up out of Leosia. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "And behold, a door was open in heaven." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, a door is a revelation. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; And Christ is that revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it was open in heaven. So he had passed through the age and he heard a voice and the voice said, "Come up either &gt;&gt; and I will show thee things uh which must be ear after the ages." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now we've got to know where the bride is. &gt;&gt; The bride is not in the age, but the bride has been called out of let us see her. Come up higher. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The message to the bride is when the seals were open &gt;&gt; is a rat. &gt;&gt; Come up higher. Let me show you things uh that must be hereafter. &gt;&gt; The bride is not in the age. You are called out of the age. We're not the church of Leosia. We are called out of Leosia into the bright age. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; I love him. &gt;&gt; In Revelation 19 and verse 10, &gt;&gt; Amen. You find &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. And I fell at his feet to worship him. Whose feet? The signifying angel. The angel that was talking to me that was showing me these things. I fell down at his feet. You know why? Because he had made Christ so plain before me. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Amen. That his words uh his words uh were the very revelation of Jesus Christ. Amen. So I fell down at his feet. But watch it now. Hallelujah. He said, "See thou do it not. &gt;&gt; For I am thy fellow servant and of thy brethren which have the testimony of who?" &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. Worship who? &gt;&gt; Amen. For the testimony of Jesus is a spirit of what? &gt;&gt; Prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you notice in Revelation chapter one when he said I'm alpha and omega. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. John said I fell down at his feet. He put his hand upon me is a rot. He is the one. Not the nail car hands. No. But the one that had come down. &gt;&gt; Are you there with me? &gt;&gt; Now we've got to put the word in perspective and know exactly where we are. &gt;&gt; Are you there with me? You know sometimes we said ah I believe the message I believe the message. Amen. But how do you see the message? Uh the message to the bride. Uh it begins with the opening of the seals. [Applause] The prophet of God said not in the years of preparation but when he begins to declare his message. &gt;&gt; Are you there with me? Hallelujah. That's where we are. You got to be caught up in the revelation of the words of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. Are you still with me? &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Are you still there? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we find that the signifying angel, Amen, to John was not to be worshiped. &gt;&gt; Are you there? Hallelujah. But in Revelation 22 and verse 8, uh, hallelujah. Amen. Let me read from verse 6. He said, "And he said unto me, these things are true and are faithful and true. And the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to show unto his servants the things which must be surely done, which must be shortly be done. Behold, I come quickly. Blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy &gt;&gt; of what? this book. &gt;&gt; The book of Revelation is not for everybody. &gt;&gt; That is why some churches don't read it &gt;&gt; because they don't understand it. &gt;&gt; Are you there with me? But the book of Revelation is our inheritance. Uh because it tell us exactly who we are. &gt;&gt; Are you there with me? It show us in perspective. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I, John, verse 8. And I, John, saw these things, and I heard them. And when I heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the what? Angel, which show me these things. And he said, and said he unto me, See, thou do it not, &gt;&gt; for I am thy fellow servant, and of thy brethren that have the prophecy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And of them that keep the sayings of this book, &gt;&gt; worship God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Can I quickly say to you, &gt;&gt; John becomes the bride. &gt;&gt; You're going to find yourself in the scripture. &gt;&gt; You know, we talk about Revelation 10:1. &gt;&gt; Who was that Christ? Revelation 10:7. Who was that? &gt;&gt; The signifying angel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But what about you? &gt;&gt; Revelation 10 8 to 11. Is that right? For I take the book. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I take the book. I heed the book. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I become what's in the book. Hey, your name is written in those seals. Your name is sealed up. Glory. That's your real name. Your your parents give you a name is a rat. That that's your name for this side. But there's another name that speak of you is a rat which your parents didn't know. Your mom and daddy didn't know that name. Uh, but you found your name. Uh, for your name is written uh in the revelation of who you are. Glory. Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Do you notice &gt;&gt; in Revelation chapter 5? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When the cry went out, who is worthy? who made the cry, the signifying angel to John &gt;&gt; to take the book. &gt;&gt; And John said, "When there was none to to take the book and to release the seals, I cried." &gt;&gt; You know why John cried? Because his name was sealed in. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And if there was none worthy to open the book, then John would be lost. You and I would be lost. Hallelujah. But thank God for the elders. Thank God for the elders uh that kept the saying of the book. The elder touched me and said, "Weep not John, for behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed." Hallelujah. Glory. [Applause] The lion has prevailed. But when John looked, he didn't see a lion &gt;&gt; because the plan of redemption, the mediatory work was not over. So what John saw was a lamb. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He saw a lamb. He saw a lamb. And that lamb was killed. That lamb was bloody. And that lamb was worthy. [Applause] And the lamb went and take the book &gt;&gt; out of the hand of the abstract owner &gt;&gt; that take it when Adam fell and lost the book. &gt;&gt; So he was worthy to take the book and when he take the book hallelujah the focus move. Amen. To the worthiness of the lamb because the lamb is worthy. And John said, "All of heaven and all of earth would have heard me when I cried, blessing and honor and power and glory to the lamb. &gt;&gt; Now an angel &gt;&gt; is a messenger." &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; And so you notice to all the seven ages, &gt;&gt; there was an angel &gt;&gt; to the church is &gt;&gt; there was a signifying angel to Ephesus. &gt;&gt; There's an angel to Smyrna. &gt;&gt; There's an angel to to Tyia. &gt;&gt; And there's an angel to Leos here. &gt;&gt; Isarat overcomers, you've got an angel. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; But the angel &gt;&gt; to the age has got a ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's got to be a ministry to the angel for that age. &gt;&gt; Because if you don't catch the revelation of the mystery &gt;&gt; that the angel of the age break, &gt;&gt; then you miss the whole redemption plan. And God will do nothing but he reveal his secret unto his servant the prophets. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So if John had an angel, &gt;&gt; then the bride must got an angel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; John had a signifying angel. The bride got a signifying angel. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the words of that angel is going to be so clear &gt;&gt; that many will try to worship &gt;&gt; the angel. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Pray for them. Pray for them for they missed the revelation by just that. &gt;&gt; Just that John when his angel come, John fell down to worship him. But the angel tell him, "See thou do it not, for I am your fellow servant and of the Oh, glory to God." In other words, I am just Eleazar. I was charged to bring a bride for Isaac and I'm just carrying out my duty. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory. But brother, it's so close. It's so close because the word he present will change my body. &gt;&gt; The word he present brings a birth. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, we got to get to the ministry &gt;&gt; of the signifying angel for your day. [Applause] in Joel chapter 2 &gt;&gt; and verse 23 to 26. &gt;&gt; I will restore it. &gt;&gt; Be glad then &gt;&gt; it children of Zion. &gt;&gt; Do do you know your Zion? &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. and rejoice in the Lord your God, for he has given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, &gt;&gt; he's going to bring the former &gt;&gt; and the latter &gt;&gt; in the same season.

They said, "Ah, you left the best wine for the last." That was good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. that when he met the woman of Samaria, he discerned the very thoughts and intents of her heart. Is that right? Oh, that was glorious.

Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Before I go there, may I clarify something? &gt;&gt; You see in page 3:27 &gt;&gt; of the church age bookh &gt;&gt; it says the prophet comes to do two things &gt;&gt; according to Malachi 4 &gt;&gt; to turn the heart of the children back to the fathers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And secondly, &gt;&gt; number two. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Number two. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Hallelujah. Number two, very important because they're trying to establish number one and they're projecting number two &gt;&gt; to reveal the mysteries to reveal the mysteries to reveal the mysteries of the seven seals. Hold on a little bit. Hold on. P your mule. Hold your mule a little bit. Hold on. Hold on. Number two, &gt;&gt; to reveal the mysteries of the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; But watch what he said. It is these mystery reveal truth that will turn your hearts back. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hey, it is the mystery revealed truth that will turn your hearts back. So if the mystery is not revealed, your heart's not turned back. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You can preach a closline doctrine all you want. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You can preach the way you live, you live, you live. That's your business. But without the mystery of the seventh seal, your heart will not be turned back. This word is a covenant of the bride. That's why he said the bride must have a birth according to Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; What is going to bring the birth? The mysteries revealed. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, there was a time &gt;&gt; when you could preach one God, &gt;&gt; no problem. &gt;&gt; Baptism in Jesus name, no problem. &gt;&gt; You could preach a closline doctrine, no problem. Amen. &gt;&gt; But if you preach the seven thunders, the third pull, the seventh seal open, there is a problem. &gt;&gt; You know why? Because quarters were up on our land. But in the name of Jesus, there's a people that is rising up. The old fighters uh are going off the scene and another generation uh is rising up with the word of God that said, "Give me the book. Give me the book. Give me the book." [Applause] Don't tell me what he meant. Just tell me what he said. [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; The third pull. &gt;&gt; The revealing of the word. &gt;&gt; The revealing of the word is the secret to the rapture.

We're called to get out of here. &gt;&gt; Come up higher. &gt;&gt; Come up higher. Hey, where was the church age to John? It was behind him. It was behind him that when he heard the voice, he turned around to look back. But thanks be to God, having been called up, come up higher. Come up higher into the opening of the word. [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; We we we need some &gt;&gt; We need some gentile warriors in this time that's not afraid to preach, not afraid to say it, not afraid to declare it.

By the unfolding of the seventh seal because the lamb take the book. &gt;&gt; And your name was in it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, so why would you want to deny me &gt;&gt; of my name being released &gt;&gt; from the book? Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The revelation of the seven thunders of Revelation 10. The bride has gone beyond the first and second pull. &gt;&gt; Yet the first and second pull is still with us. &gt;&gt; But we're not following those signs. The signs are following us. [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; The bride has gone beyond. &gt;&gt; We've been called up &gt;&gt; out of &gt;&gt; into the opening of the word. &gt;&gt; So the opening of the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. A fold of the third. Hallelujah. Amen. Function Revelation 10. &gt;&gt; Amen. What it's telling us is that the for the former and the latter rain is in the same season. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it's falling together.

There's got to be the coming of the word. Is that right? Where the word is in power again. &gt;&gt; And we need to go back and identify that word. For in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. Then we're going to pick up Colossians 1:15. Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You are here because of his pleasure. because I'm identified in it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're not here because somebody invited you.

Revelation 10:1 come on the scene. Is a rot. &gt;&gt; Well, what's going to happen? Woo. &gt;&gt; Do Do you realize that? Brother Bam said Revelation 8:1 just give the scenery. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; The scenery. &gt;&gt; And when he'd opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven. about half an hour. &gt;&gt; But but you know in Revelation five when he take the book there was a rejoicing [Applause] &gt;&gt; glory. &gt;&gt; But in Revelation 8:1 when he break the seventh seal &gt;&gt; there was silence &gt;&gt; because all redemption plan was now revealed. &gt;&gt; Nothing can stop you now. And when it's fully open, what did he do? He stepped down. I I'm going to take charge of what I've redeemed. Oh, glory. And so when he stepped down from heaven, there was silence.

[Applause] &gt;&gt; So, Revelation 8:1, he step out from the throne &gt;&gt; and oh, silence. For wherever he is, there's a noise. And so when he stepped down the silence, but then there's going to be another shout. &gt;&gt; Revelation 10:1 when he stepped down &gt;&gt; and when he speak it was like a lion roar when this revelation hit you and seven and thundered their voice. And John said, "I was going to write it out." &gt;&gt; But said, "No, John, don't write it. Seal it up. Seal it up until the time of the end." &gt;&gt; Then he put one foot on the sea, one foot on the hurt. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All authority is under your feet. Glory, glory, glory, glory, glory.

The third pull the opening of the word and the mysteries reveal. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You see Kane Kane taught it was works. [Applause] &gt;&gt; He thought it was works. &gt;&gt; Cain taught that it was works. But when he saw Abel &gt;&gt; take a stone &gt;&gt; and try to cut &gt;&gt; Hallelujah &gt;&gt; that lamb cuz it had to die. &gt;&gt; And he hacked it and he hacked it. Woo! Blood splattered everywhere. What a mess that was. And Cain looked at it and said, "Uh-uh. It can't be." Oh, Jesus. Hallelujah. But I tell you what, a blood revelation. Woo! Jesus, that is going to take blood. Cuz I was looking at mom and daddy and I saw blood spot running down their feet and I saw the horn of skin and it revealed something. Uh, it moves something within me. Uh, it's got to be blood. Hallelujah. And now the bloody word speak on your behalf. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You still with me? &gt;&gt; So he said &gt;&gt; no more &gt;&gt; there is no more higher order to reveal the word than a prophet. So the signifying angel is a prophet. &gt;&gt; But the only way the prophet can be a vindicated is by the word. &gt;&gt; And remember the third pull was the opening of the word. &gt;&gt; So if the third pull is the opening of the word, &gt;&gt; why why don't you want me to say it? What? What's your problem? &gt;&gt; What is your problem? &gt;&gt; What's your problem? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Are you trying to hide something from me? &gt;&gt; Are you trying to take my redemptive blessing? &gt;&gt; If the third pull is a opening of the word &gt;&gt; and if the word's not open, then all creation go is lost. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; The reveal hidden truth &gt;&gt; that being sealed &gt;&gt; in the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; So the third pull &gt;&gt; one the opening of the word. &gt;&gt; Secondly, &gt;&gt; ministering to the eternally lost. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because listen, when when this revelation come on the scene, &gt;&gt; they're going to push you out. &gt;&gt; They're going to shut There's some churches that's called message church that's going to shut their doors to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They don't want to hear that. &gt;&gt; They'll tell you they believe God sent a prophet. &gt;&gt; Then what did the prophet say? [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen, the door of salvation is still open. &gt;&gt; Jesus come in Revelation 10:1. &gt;&gt; Not the corporal coming &gt;&gt; but the coming of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As the manifested word to the bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not the nails card Jesus. No. &gt;&gt; In the corporal body, &gt;&gt; no. Claiming the redeemed bride during the seven church ages of his intercessory ministry. The Holy Ghost is still here. &gt;&gt; And because the Holy Ghost is still here, there is still grace. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. You You know why the grace is here? Because you are here. But because I tell you when you leave the earth, grace also leave the earth. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And when you leave the earth and grace leave the earth, then the tribulation must set in. &gt;&gt; So what is holding back the tribulation? You. &gt;&gt; And God is waiting on some of you that are lazy and slotful and refuse to pray. and to press through. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Still living on the fringes of the message just to say I'm in the message church. Hey, it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; What is the Holy Ghost? You can't make it without it. &gt;&gt; What is the Holy Ghost? It's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And how did this revelation come to John? &gt;&gt; By the signifying angel. [Music] &gt;&gt; And how will this revelation come to you? By the signifying angel. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You You see, why are we going throughout all the earth? &gt;&gt; We who have receive the message. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We're not just comfortable in our church. &gt;&gt; But I tell you, &gt;&gt; I I travel some distance by myself. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Flight to New York. &gt;&gt; 14 and 1/2 hours to Dubai. Where you going? I'm going down into East Africa. &gt;&gt; Prophesy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To prophesy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I &gt;&gt; I left Kala drive 9 hours into Kamasi, Kenya, way into the jungle. And when we drove up, the brother come to the door and said, "They are singing the song. They're ready for you to preach &gt;&gt; sacrifice." &gt;&gt; Why? Because there's an urge in this hour. [Applause] Not just that they hear the voice of the seventh angel, but that the revelation of the word &gt;&gt; comes to the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we're going from country to country. going back to our people to make sure because you remember down in Egypt &gt;&gt; when they had to put the blood and the lintil on the doorpost &gt;&gt; and he said, "Daddy, are you sure &gt;&gt; that you're preaching the opening of the word? [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, when the lost soul received the message, the door of salvation will be closed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The bride will still be here for a little while. &gt;&gt; You know why you're going to be here for a little while? &gt;&gt; Because those saints that has gone on in the regions &gt;&gt; of the dead, &gt;&gt; you got to wait on them &gt;&gt; because they've got to gather with their people. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because when a brother or sister from the assemblers pass, &gt;&gt; you have not lost a member, &gt;&gt; you've gained a witness &gt;&gt; on the other side. &gt;&gt; And in that dimension, they're seeing clearer than you are seeing here. And from the porters, they're crying out to you. Just hold on a little bit more. A little bit more. Amen. &gt;&gt; And they're waiting on us to bring that revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To material. &gt;&gt; What What do you mean by that? You you you remember Eleaza coming with Rebecca on the way. &gt;&gt; And she never see Isaac. &gt;&gt; She didn't know what he looks like. But as Eleaza tell her about him, the words of Eleaza was materializing in her body. &gt;&gt; When she come out on the plane and she look out and you see that man standing at the door of the tent, Eleaza never had to say anything more because the words of Eleaza have materialized in her body. Hallelujah. And she lighted from the camel. That's what the message is doing to you and I today. It's bringing the revelation of Jesus Christ back to material. Hallelujah. That you are sick. You don't come to church crying, pastor, pray for me. Because he that is preaching to you is in you. If the word be preached to you not materializing in the body of Jesus Christ, you're wasting your time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; It's preaching your position. It's telling you authority. It letting you know where you stand. It's putting you in position. It's giving you your purpose. And nobody can take your place. And you can't take nobody place. Hallelujah. Glory to God. My my my glory. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They can't take your place. You can't take their place. He's a w. But nobody can shut you out of it. &gt;&gt; It's a rat. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said they will reject the third pull. &gt;&gt; Then Revelation 22:11, he that is Hallelujah unjust, let him be unjust still. &gt;&gt; He which is filthy, let him be filthy still. He that is righteous, let him be righteous still. And he that is holy, let him be holy still. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Things that are to be. And I believe that the same thing we live in today, God bearing record of his word by vindicating what he said to do, hallelujah, he would do. Now we know that this is a day of salvation where God is calling men, amen, from the world, amen, from a life of sin unto a life of service. And in the day that God has poured out his his spirit from on high, great signs and wonders are accompanying the ministry of this day. This is when the former and the latter rain falling together. &gt;&gt; Amen. We know that there is supposed to be a great sign and wonder which in many great denomination it is turn down. &gt;&gt; Amen. that they're turning it down. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; But we thank God for revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It may be almost past feeling time &gt;&gt; because there will come a time like when the spirit of God will be withdrawn from the earth. There will be no more. The church will remain a while. And that's right. Preaching. Amen. because it has to preach uh to the eternally lost. Uh just as every ministry did coming down through the age. The last part of every ministry preach to the eternally lost. And there will be a ministry now that will preach to the eternal lost after they have refused to receive it to receive what? The revelation of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Then it look at Noah's message. &gt;&gt; Amen. But when he locked the heart the door of the ark, it stayed for a little while. Is that where we are today? Hallelujah. Amen. Could it be that the days are over? Amen. And those that are in are in Sodom and Gomorrah. Jesus refer to both of them coming before the coming of the son of man. So shall it be like in Noah's day. So shall it be like hallelujah. In the days of Sodom, Noah had three pulls. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it third was the last. Amen. After the door was shut, for God let it sit there. Right there. Amen. Where nobody could enter or go out. Amen. They were inside. For Amen. On the seventh mountain. Amen. The highest mountain. Amen. That's where he settled the ark. Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. In the days of Sodom. &gt;&gt; Amen. The first pull was h the righteous Lot. Amen. Sin of Sodom vex his righteous soul. Hallelujah. Now then the woman acted. Hallelujah. And done. You remember as it was in the days of Noah. Amen. What was they doing? Heating, drinking, marrying, giving in marriage. Women see women. Amen. That was it in that day. Sodom. The first message was Lot. Hallelujah. Then laugh him to scorn. Amen. They sent another messenger. Two of them. Amen. And they went down. And it was his second pull. &gt;&gt; But look at the one that went last. Hallelujah. There was more and more mercy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was all over then. All over at that time, the third messenger that went down there. Amen. The third pull. Amen. What was he? Amen. What kind of ministry did he have? He sent with the elect. Amen. And told them, well, there was talking taking place behind him. Amen. But when he step off into Babylon, Amen. or into Sodom. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Bre, you look at the way the world is going today. Can I say to you, look at your politics. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Look at the way the world is going. &gt;&gt; Look at the condition of the nations. &gt;&gt; Amen. Tell me. &gt;&gt; Amen. What time is it? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "What if it is?" Look at the scripture Paul in here. Could it be his third pull to preach to the eternally doomed that's rejected the message of salvation? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And brethren, may I say this? &gt;&gt; The land of demarcation is so close. Right. &gt;&gt; Very true. &gt;&gt; Look at the last pope &gt;&gt; and and I was listening to his message, his opening message that he preached when Hallelujah. when he when he accepted that position &gt;&gt; and he was talking about the wise and the foolish virgins. &gt;&gt; He was talking about harvest time. And if I didn't know this message, I could not reject the things that he said. &gt;&gt; Then it started to come to me. It said the two will be so close together. &gt;&gt; How could you reject that message? &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It is so close. &gt;&gt; Mama, and I was saying to myself, I I wonder if he's reading brother Brandham's message. Could it be that he's reading the message? &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. And he knows exactly the words to say. &gt;&gt; But I thank God the elect cannot be deceived. &gt;&gt; Because she is the word. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Could it be? &gt;&gt; Amen. When you look at Hallelujah. Now Iran. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Rising in power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Gog and Mog nation and its power. &gt;&gt; Amen. That rule it. Amen. Setting over Israel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you watch. Amen. The divide now with political Israel and the Orthodox Israel. Because if you're not careful, &gt;&gt; you can't pray for Israel because of the atrocities &gt;&gt; that is going on. &gt;&gt; Are you there with me? But you look, not all Israel is Israel. There's a political Israel and there's a Zionist. Amen. That is waiting uh Amen. for Hallelujah. the third temple to be built and the opening of the eastern gate. That's the one that we're praying for. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you're not careful, the politics of the day take you over. But our prophet says, Hallelujah. The politics of every nation is of the devil. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not some nation. Every nation. I don't care whether you're Republican or Democrat. It's all a deadly system. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You better take side with Jesus. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Make one vote for the cross of Calvary. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see when Lot went towards Sodom, &gt;&gt; he never straightway going to Sodom. No, he went towards Shinoi. But you know the the Hallelujah the boundaries of Sodom has expanded and Lot was drawn into it. &gt;&gt; And that's why you got to watch in this time. &gt;&gt; Oh, you said I'm I'm not a part of it, but but but this is my choice. You you got to watch it now because when they extend the b the boundaries uh Amen. then you're drawn into it. Uh take your eyes out of it. Uh take your hands off it. Uh it is not for you. Hallelujah. Amen. There's a revelation uh of Jesus Christ uh amen. And that's what we are for. Let them fulfill their part of the book. We've got to fulfill our part of the book.

Stand up against injustice. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; What they're doing is not right. &gt;&gt; No. Separating families and all. It's not right. &gt;&gt; Amen. We stand for the cross of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The opening of the word &gt;&gt; preach the eternal loss. &gt;&gt; And thirdly, the manifestation of the spoken word, &gt;&gt; the demonstration and exercising of the power of the word. &gt;&gt; I update your experience. God's not dead. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He said, "If you ain't got faith for divine healing, oh, you're going to have faith for the change of the body."

You see, it's a time, the same time that the door was closed that the fullness of the third pull would be go in full effect. &gt;&gt; Amen. It is just laying dormant for and waiting for the squeeze to come in. &gt;&gt; And brethren, I tell you what, &gt;&gt; if what we're seeing today is not bringing on a squeeze, &gt;&gt; nations are breaking, &gt;&gt; Israel awaking, &gt;&gt; the signs that the prophet foretold, &gt;&gt; the whole nation is nervous. &gt;&gt; The whole world &gt;&gt; is in turmoil. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But there's something happening within the bride. &gt;&gt; I said there's something happening within the bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is the third pull. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And and he said, "Amen." He said, "This is the third pull used in a greater way in the time of persecution, the squeeze, the hour of temptation of the bride." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The antichrist, brother, the the the pontiff, the pope &gt;&gt; of Rome. the the the pap say Iraqi who at this time has gone take control now hallelujah amen and is in the seat it's a monopoly brother I was driving with the brother he was praying the tape he didn't know why I was going to preach and I hear brother screaming he said listen communism will never rule the worldism &gt;&gt; government politics one world government religion one world religion, the commerce, and when the pope come on the scene, he was calling all the religion together. &gt;&gt; And brother, he had such a charm &gt;&gt; when he did it. I &gt;&gt; if listen, if I didn't know this message, I'd want to be a Catholic today. &gt;&gt; But he said the two will be so close together. &gt;&gt; For you know what they miss? The revelation of Jesus Christ. That doctrine of the Trinity &gt;&gt; is alive from the pit of hell. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And and you know the mark how they judge a church whether or not it's a cult. &gt;&gt; They judge if you stand with the Trinity. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Did you know that? &gt;&gt; Cuz if you don't believe in the Holy Trinity, &gt;&gt; you're a cult. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what they use. &gt;&gt; That very lie that they've made themselves. But hear me, O Israel, the Lord your God &gt;&gt; is one Lord. &gt;&gt; In Revelation chapter 4, he said, "And I see one sat on the throne." That's right. &gt;&gt; And he that was to look upon as a Sardis &gt;&gt; and Jasper Stone, it was Reuben and Benjamin, &gt;&gt; the first and the last. And the covenant of the rainbow &gt;&gt; was round about the throne. &gt;&gt; You know, after the flood, the rainbow was halfway. &gt;&gt; Amen. But when it was caught up in Revelation 4:1, the rainbow was around the throne, showing that the covenant was complete. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said in the sight like an &gt;&gt; emerald. Emerald, &gt;&gt; Judah, &gt;&gt; Judah, &gt;&gt; for out of Judah shall rise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. These symbols in the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, at this time, he's in charge &gt;&gt; to actualize his new world order. &gt;&gt; And that's what they're setting out to do. &gt;&gt; Which he is right now with cunning and deceit. Amen. Like a serpent is kissing the feet of the mos, accepting every road as the access to heaven to gain control of government, religion, commerce. &gt;&gt; Oh, the Bible say you won't be able to buy or sell. Hallelujah. Amen. That you can't buy or sell unless hallelujah. You are part of the league. &gt;&gt; Amen. That beast, a satanic organization under Rome. That's right. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The Pope, this guy, Amen, is a con man. &gt;&gt; He take the very words of the bride. &gt;&gt; The very words that listen, if they come with Pentecost again, the Pentecost today, they'll never catch us. We we long past that. &gt;&gt; But he's speaking the very language. &gt;&gt; There it is, my dear. &gt;&gt; And that's what the serpent did to Heave. He begin to speak the same language. &gt;&gt; Did not God said. &gt;&gt; It took the very quote. &gt;&gt; It took the very quote &gt;&gt; did not God said amen. &gt;&gt; But then he come to a conclusion. You will not surely die. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. You You got to be careful now. &gt;&gt; You catch the true revelation of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Hallelujah. I'm coming down. He said, "Hallelujah. Amen. Stop the bride, &gt;&gt; the true church, the elect lady, the wise virgin. They're trying, they're going to try to stop you from fellowshipping around the world and denying her of her form." Hallelujah. Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; A great hour of problem indeed &gt;&gt; for the elected bride. &gt;&gt; It is the hour of temptation. &gt;&gt; Is that right? You know, maybe there comes a day when you can't meet here like this. &gt;&gt; But when the revelation of Jesus Christ is in your heart, &gt;&gt; it doesn't matter if we come together &gt;&gt; because wherever you are, &gt;&gt; God is. That's why we take pleasure in the time that we have now to come together because a time is coming when we might not be able to come together &gt;&gt; but let them bring it on. &gt;&gt; Let them bring it on because there are some people almost everywhere whose lives are all a flame [Applause] &gt;&gt; with the fire &gt;&gt; that fell at Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's some preacher over the land. There's some young men that are rising up with a fire of God. &gt;&gt; And defying all odds with the revelation of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We will not back down. &gt;&gt; We will not give up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We will declare it &gt;&gt; no matter what they do because we know who we have believed in. And we're persuaded that he's able to keep that which we have committed unto him against that day. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is a bride in the land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The sons of God &gt;&gt; are manifesting on the face of the earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The baptism of the Holy Ghost, the adoption, the placing of the son. Amen. By the message, hallelujah. of the seventh star that we've had in our day. &gt;&gt; Revelation 10 3 and 4, the seven thunders are being declared. &gt;&gt; Is that right? The mysteries contained under the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; Then listen now. There has been five witnesses of the spoken word third pull. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the signifying angels ministry. &gt;&gt; So that we've got vindication.

Five straight signs without failure. &gt;&gt; In the life of the signifying angel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen.

I will always remember it because at the bottom he signed his name, Isaac Newton. I can't forget that name. I'm an engineer, you know, so I I remember that name. But he he said he was in a motor vehicle accident and he was like in the back and he he flew through the front windscreen. Break it and he fall on his head and he has a brain concussion and um he just can't function anymore. But he said something tell him that when I come to Uganda to have me pray for him and everything would be all right. &gt;&gt; That that's what he said.

So when I was through I gave brother Gideon and he read it and the young man came forward and and I went listen I believe God my God is a healer. &gt;&gt; I believe that &gt;&gt; and I held him by the head and I prayed for him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was Friday afternoon. Saturday morning I left at six o'clock and I went over to Kenya to the other convention and while I was there they sent me the video. The brother came the following day in the meeting and was testifying. &gt;&gt; He said in that dream that he had the same place that I placed my hand I put my hand exactly there and he said all the concussion and everything that he had it's gone. My God is a healer. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and I tell you, sometimes we are afraid to speak God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But but that's our inheritance. &gt;&gt; When the word is restored, everything is restored.

Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother, I want a message. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That put me into it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; If it's all on the seventh angel messenger, then what about me? &gt;&gt; He was not the object of this message. No, &gt;&gt; John had to take the book. &gt;&gt; Hey, &gt;&gt; and when he take the book, he had to heed the book. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you are the final voice. &gt;&gt; For the final age. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the message shalom, as I finish, he said, "And we all know &gt;&gt; that's the identification." Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We know what the third pull is. &gt;&gt; We all We all understand that now. You've got you'll you'll have the tape. See, and I think it'll just lay dormant for a little while &gt;&gt; until the great hour of persecution comes on. &gt;&gt; That's when it will be. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It will speak. &gt;&gt; It will be manifested just like the five straight signs without failure. &gt;&gt; Amen. perfectly. &gt;&gt; And now I think just wait. See? Hallelujah. To see what it's done. Now I'm going back &gt;&gt; the same again. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Through and through to find out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is the musicians come now? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now I'm going to say something to you now. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That I haven't said all along. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that is that the thing that we've looked forward to for a long for so long &gt;&gt; for at least many years, four or five years or maybe longer, the third pull &gt;&gt; now was being vindicated. And I'm sure you all know what it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now remember, remember this now. You'll never be there. It will never be impersonated of that cuz it can't be. &gt;&gt; Mm- No. I am I I was warned of this right at the time now. It's just happened. So it could identify its presence among you, but it will not be used in a great way until the council begin to tighten up. And when it does, hallelujah, &gt;&gt; the Pentecostals and so forth can almost impersonate anything that we've that's been done. But when that time comes, when the squeeze comes down, then you'll see what you're seeing temporarily being manifested in the fullness of its power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so, as I close in the Philadelphia age, he says, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation. That's right. which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth. That's right. &gt;&gt; Revelation 3:10. &gt;&gt; Amen. This verse is not to a declaration that the church will go in or through tribulation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If it meant that, it would have said that. &gt;&gt; It will keep thee from the hour of temptation. This temptation is exactly like the temptation in Eden. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. It will be a very inviting proposition held up in direct opposition to God's commanded word. &gt;&gt; Watch it, church. &gt;&gt; And yet from the standpoint of human reasoning, it will be so very right. &gt;&gt; From human reasoning, &gt;&gt; in other words, if you ask your neighbor, it's a right thing. &gt;&gt; Correct? If you ask those beside, it's a right thing &gt;&gt; from human reasoning, it looks so very right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So enlightening and lifegiving as to fool the world. Only the very elect will not be fooled. &gt;&gt; The temptation will come as follow. The ecumenical move that has started on what seems such a beautiful and blessed principle fulfilling Christ that we all might be one &gt;&gt; become so strong politically &gt;&gt; that she bears pressure upon the government to cause all to join with her either directly or through adherance to the principle enacted into law. So that no people will be recognized as actual churches unless under direct or indirect dominion &gt;&gt; of this council. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Little group &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Little groups will lose their charter. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Privileges. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Etc. until they lose all property and spiritual rights with the people. For example, the right now unless a local ministeral association approved in many if not most cities, one cannot rent a building for religious services to become a chaplain in the armed forces, hospital etc. It is now almost mandatory to be recognized as ac as accepted to the trinitarian ecumenical group. As this pressure increase, and it will &gt;&gt; it will be harder to resist, &gt;&gt; for to resist is to lose privilege. &gt;&gt; And so many will be tempted to go along. &gt;&gt; So many, &gt;&gt; so many, &gt;&gt; let's just accept it and have church. &gt;&gt; That's what they'll say. For they will feel it is better to serve God publicly in the framework of this organization than not to serve God at all publicly. &gt;&gt; But they hear &gt;&gt; they here &gt;&gt; to believe the devil's lie is to serve Satan. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Even though you might want to call him Jehovah, &gt;&gt; but the elect will not be deceived. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The ministry of the signifying angel. Listen. Furthermore, the elect will not only be kept, &gt;&gt; but as this move becomes the image erected to the beast, the saints will be gone in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Let the squeeze come. &gt;&gt; I'm going home. &gt;&gt; And this little delightful, winsome movement that started out in fellowship as Ephesus will become the monstr of Satan that defy and deceive the whole world. For the church system of the Roman Catholic and the Protestant is coming together will control the whole wealth of the world system and force the whole earth into its religious trap &gt;&gt; or will kill them &gt;&gt; by refusing them the privilege of buying or selling whereby they would make a living. &gt;&gt; This will be accomplished simply for the harlot's daughter are all but gone back to her. That's right. &gt;&gt; In the meantime, Rome has acquired nearly all the supplies of gold. The Jews have the bonds and all the paper. At the right time, the harlot will destroy the present day money system by calling in all the paper and demanding gold. &gt;&gt; With no gold, the system will fail. &gt;&gt; The Jews will be trapped and come into an alliance and the Harlot church will take over the whole world. It's coming brethren. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. &gt;&gt; And everyone know that for as certain as the first was identified, &gt;&gt; so as the second being identified. &gt;&gt; And if you will think real closely, you will you who are spiritual, as the Bible said, here is the him that has wisdom, the third is properly identified. &gt;&gt; We know where it is. So the third pull is here. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Look away to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is so sacred that I must stay so much say so much about it. &gt;&gt; As he told me in the beginning said this, say nothing of it. &gt;&gt; You remember that years ago? &gt;&gt; It speaks for itself. &gt;&gt; I've tried to explain the others and I've made mistake. This will be the thing that in my opinion I don't say the Lord tell me this. This will be a thing that will start the rapturing fate for the going away. &gt;&gt; Do you believe? &gt;&gt; Do you believe? &gt;&gt; Do you believe? &gt;&gt; This will be the thing. &gt;&gt; It's not coming. It's here. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I must lay quiet for a little while. &gt;&gt; Now remember, and who is listening to this tape, &gt;&gt; you might see much a ch a change in my ministry right away. Dropping back. Not going up, dropping back. We are right at the age now &gt;&gt; and it can't be can't go any further. &gt;&gt; We have to wait &gt;&gt; just a minute until this happen over here &gt;&gt; to catch up. &gt;&gt; Then the time comes. If we never meet again &gt;&gt; on this earth, my precious friend, &gt;&gt; if to God you have been true &gt;&gt; and have lived above all sin, then for us there'll be a meeting. They can't take us from that. God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. God bless you. God bless you. [Applause] The ministry of the signifying angel is complete &gt;&gt; and all we've got to do is to believe. Everything that we need to the rapture is here. God bless you. God bless you, my brother. [Applause] [Music] Wonderful. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Here, brother Ke. Praise God. Praise God. What a message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Ke, Wednesday is our convention. &gt;&gt; So, this is a convention message right here. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God, &gt;&gt; my brother. This was loaded, &gt;&gt; my sister. This is loaded. Go home and review this again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God spoke to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; You in the right. &gt;&gt; You are where the opening of the seals are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The momentum is changing. The season is changing. Everything is changing. And God is bringing a new energy &gt;&gt; that is pushing for last time &gt;&gt; so we can go into the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The only thing that make a difference between us and denomination is the seals. &gt;&gt; Because when the seals open up, then the Bible changes. &gt;&gt; The way we read the Bible, &gt;&gt; the way we look at the Bible, the think we see in the Bible is completely different than denomination. &gt;&gt; Until you sit down, you talk to somebody and they look at you, they say, "Where did you learn theology?" &gt;&gt; I didn't learn theology. It is the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham said to my opinion it is not the lord telling me you remember Paul saying this is not the lord this is me and it's written in the bible &gt;&gt; and the bible say every scripture is inspired &gt;&gt; so even the opinion of Paul was inspired &gt;&gt; and brotherham say I preach like Paul &gt;&gt; amen you need to read between the lines &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; it is not an opinion it is god's word for us &gt;&gt; amen Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Speak to your storm. &gt;&gt; Speak to your trouble. &gt;&gt; God is bringing everything back in order. &gt;&gt; And I praise God for elders like this &gt;&gt; that are standing for the word and that are pushing. This is not going to be easy, but you got to stand for it &gt;&gt; because God will hold you accountable of what he open up or revealed to you. &gt;&gt; The other person didn't understand that didn't see it. It's a different story. But you saw it. &gt;&gt; But if you saw it, you walk away from it. &gt;&gt; That's the problem. &gt;&gt; Once you see it, you are doomed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You must stay with it &gt;&gt; because God actually showing you mercy and grace to move on. Amen. &gt;&gt; There is nothing difficult for this brother. God have given us the devil's answer. This sermon is prophetic. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The third pool is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The third pool is here. &gt;&gt; Whether you believe it or not, it's here. &gt;&gt; But if you can believe like a simple child, &gt;&gt; when God declared that it's here, &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; go to school. When they calling for food, go straight to the food table. &gt;&gt; Go get your food because it's been paid for. &gt;&gt; It's been spoken. &gt;&gt; The third pool is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's pray.
