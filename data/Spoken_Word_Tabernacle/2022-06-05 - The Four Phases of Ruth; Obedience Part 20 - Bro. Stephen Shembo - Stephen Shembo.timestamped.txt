[57:14] and poured it on he upon his head the
[57:17] head of saul
[57:18] and kissed him and said
[57:21] is it not because the lord has anointed
[57:24] you to be captain over his inheritance
[57:28] this is not the baptism of the holy
[57:30] spirit
[57:32] this is a consecration as a king
[57:34] anybody care
[57:36] everybody cares so far so the spirit of
[57:39] the lord is commanded to come on the
[57:42] life of saul because what i'm saying
[57:44] that's the reason why we are known to
[57:45] the sick it's a representation of the
[57:49] spirit amen

[58:39] and they will say to you
[58:42] the asses
[58:43] which you went to seek are found because
[58:46] the assets of uh
[58:49] our soul's father were lost
[58:51] but those two men has a message
[58:55] they do have a message and their message
[58:59] is that
[59:00] what was lost

[1:00:21] will reach
[1:00:22] rachel's tomb
[1:00:24] and he will see two men by the tomb
[1:00:29] and those two men by the tomb have a

[1:01:12] of the covenant with the mercy seat and
[1:01:14] the caribbean
[1:01:16] everybody okay so far

[1:01:28] what happened
[1:01:30] in rachel's tomb
[1:01:33] anybody knows what happened in rachel's
[1:01:35] tomb
[1:01:36] anybody
[1:01:41] the bible says in genesis 35 verse 16
[1:01:46] that
[1:01:47] jacob was journeying with his family
[1:01:51] and the bible say and the journey from
[1:01:53] bethel
[1:01:54] and there was by the leader way to come
[1:01:57] to ephrath which is uh bethlehem ephrata
[1:02:01] and rachel did water
[1:02:04] so rachel as they were going closer to
[1:02:08] ephrata or bethlehem rachel was pregnant
[1:02:16] rachel was pregnant
[1:02:19] and rachel was pregnant with a son
[1:02:23] and what was his name
[1:02:27] everybody okay
[1:02:30] which tribe did saul came out of it
[1:02:35] everybody okay
[1:02:36] everybody okay now we trapped the soul
[1:02:39] came out of it
[1:02:40] when you look at the scripture
[1:02:43] superficially
[1:02:45] you will come up with a
[1:02:49] everybody okay so rachel travail
[1:02:53] she needed to give birth
[1:02:54] and she had easy labor
[1:03:01] she had a hard
[1:03:03] or difficult labor
[1:03:06] in other words it was a difficult time
[1:03:13] everybody here
[1:03:14] for rachel pregnant
[1:03:16] hallelujah
[1:03:18] he says
[1:03:19] and he came to pass
[1:03:21] when she was in hard labor
[1:03:24] that the midwife said unto her fear not
[1:03:29] that shall have this son also
[1:03:32] so not only was rachel pregnant
[1:03:36] or traveling
[1:03:38] but rachel was giving birth
[1:03:45] but it was a painful
[1:03:47] birth
[1:03:49] everybody okay
[1:03:50] and it came to pass
[1:03:52] as her soul was wet
[1:03:55] so the birth of rachel was combined with
[1:03:59] her death yes
[1:04:08] everybody okay
[1:04:10] hallelujah
[1:04:12] i'm lucky because now you're stretching
[1:04:14] already anybody okay
[1:04:16] for she did water
[1:04:18] she died
[1:04:19] that she called his name ben oni which
[1:04:23] means the son of masoro
[1:04:26] but his father called him benjamin which
[1:04:29] means the son of my right hand
[1:04:32] in other words the son of my power
[1:04:35] everybody okay
[1:04:36] and richard died
[1:04:38] and was buried in the way to ephra which
[1:04:41] is water
[1:04:42] and jacob set up a pillar upon her grave
[1:04:47] that is the pillars of rachel's grave
[1:04:50] unto this
[1:04:52] so the third song that when you are
[1:04:55] leaving from uh samuel the first son you
[1:04:59] will see two men
[1:05:01] by rachel's tomb
[1:05:05] everybody okay now we well we know now

[1:25:02] that roof have to go into the tabernacle
[1:25:06] roof enter into the gate you understand
[1:25:08] what it means
[1:25:10] and in the gate she had to face the
[1:25:12] present altar
[1:25:13] when she made a decision and that
[1:25:16] decision justify her
[1:25:18] and then you don't take a decision only

[1:25:24] next stage where roof have to be
[1:25:26] baptized everybody okay
[1:25:29] showing
[1:25:30] outwardly will happen inwardly amen and
[1:25:33] when you complete this stage
[1:25:36] according to ezekiel you get a new heart
[1:25:39] then roof move into the second stage
[1:25:42] into the holy place this is where we are
[1:25:45] everybody okay so far
[1:25:47] now as we begin to study this
[1:25:50] taking the tabernacle blending the
[1:25:53] tabernacle with roof and blending the
[1:25:55] tabernacle with the messenger and
[1:25:58] blending the tab and alcohol with
[1:25:59] ezekiel as far as must be a new heart
[1:26:03] a new spirit and the holy spirit we
[1:26:06] found out that on wednesday the holy
[1:26:08] spirit inserted esther
[1:26:13] everybody okay
[1:26:14] how does esther blend with the
[1:26:17] tabernacle because roof has four stages
[1:26:21] it is roof number one deciding
[1:26:24] everybody okay the second one is roof
[1:26:27] serving
[1:26:28] the third one is roof resting
[1:26:30] and the fourth one is roof rewarded and

[1:26:59] the palace
[1:27:00] and her name was queen vesta
[1:27:03] and vassa was rejected by the king
[1:27:06] completely
[1:27:07] and when she was rejected by the king
[1:27:11] when she was rejected by the king a
[1:27:13] decree was given that they should gather
[1:27:17] new virgin
[1:27:20] everybody okay
[1:27:21] so we have a big castle here a big
[1:27:25] palace

[1:28:17] was given permission to enter
[1:28:20] but the decree that came from the king
[1:28:23] was an opening of the gate of the palace
[1:28:30] but here the decree was an invitation
[1:28:35] into the palace
[1:28:37] the palace that was closed

[2:03:30] oh good to see you today
[2:03:32] ma your honor your excellency
[2:03:35] oh you have leprosy oh in the name of
[2:03:38] jesus christ let proceed move
[2:03:42] preconceived idea
[2:03:45] [Music]
[2:03:47] [Applause]
[2:03:48] and not only preconceive idea we have
[2:03:52] complicated the gospel
[2:03:57] until when you bring the simple gospel
[2:04:00] people don't understand it
[2:04:07] i am telling you by the word
[2:04:10] take whatever you struggling with
[2:04:13] throw it away
[2:04:14] in obedience to god and confess and move
[2:04:18] on in your life
[2:04:21] do you follow me
[2:04:22] i am struggling with my dresses i'm not
[2:04:25] gonna say i'm gonna sit and wait for the
[2:04:28] lord to help me grow in my
[2:04:31] uh the way i dress oh i'm gonna wait
[2:04:33] first and wait for the lord to help me
[2:04:36] and change my haircut
[2:04:38] and stop wearing the paint so then i
[2:04:42] will come back and serve the lord who
[2:04:44] told you that
[2:04:46] who told you that
[2:04:48] who told you that
[2:04:50] god say i need to cut my hair good
[2:04:52] tomorrow i'm at the barbershop
[2:04:54] i cut my hair good i said father forgive
[2:04:57] me for cutting my hair bad from today on
[2:05:01] because i love you i will never do that
[2:05:03] again and i'm back in church
[2:05:07] and i continue to serve god
[2:05:10] because when you confess you are not
[2:05:13] naturally delivered yet
[2:05:17] but here
[2:05:18] the problem is we try to hold on to the
[2:05:21] think
[2:05:22] we don't want to let it go and we're
[2:05:24] expecting a power to come down
[2:05:27] here and what we're giving you is a
[2:05:29] simple instruction
[2:05:31] but
[2:05:32] we're not used to simple stuff
[2:05:34] [Music]
[2:05:37] you want somebody to tell you go fast 10
[2:05:40] days
[2:05:41] guess what all of you will do it
[2:05:44] if somebody tell you first 10 days
[2:05:47] you're gonna get delivered you'll see
[2:05:48] young people fasting 10 days
[2:05:50] because we love complicated stuff
[2:05:56] do not sleep all night pray somebody
[2:05:59] will stay all night pray if you look at
[2:06:01] him you say hey
[2:06:02] talk to god when you finish go to sleep
[2:06:07] i don't think i've seen people really
[2:06:09] really really
[2:06:11] how many times have you been doing all
[2:06:12] your praying
[2:06:14] why is that demon still there you don't
[2:06:16] understand the principle of god
[2:06:22] everybody here
[2:06:23] are not a banner and purple
[2:06:27] reverse of water
[2:06:29] better than all the water of water
[2:06:32] may are not washing them and be clean so
[2:06:36] he turned and went away in water
[2:06:39] not only did he want his ways
[2:06:42] but he want to take the prophet way
[2:06:45] and alter
[2:06:48] change the prophet message
[2:06:51] to fit what he want
[2:06:55] the prophet said jordan
[2:06:59] you don't think the prophet did not know
[2:07:01] these rivers
[2:07:02] but he says no
[2:07:04] let's let's listen together jordan got
[2:07:07] water right
[2:07:08] these rivers also got water right and
[2:07:11] matter of fact this river the water are
[2:07:13] cleaner than jordan why not going in a
[2:07:16] clean water versus this
[2:07:19] do you see where you get in trouble
[2:07:21] i don't see what is wrong with this
[2:07:23] haircut it is just a scissor that they
[2:07:25] put like this what does it have to do
[2:07:27] with spirit
[2:07:29] you say that paint that paint it's just
[2:07:32] a paint
[2:07:33] no no it's a spirit
[2:07:36] it is a spirit
[2:07:38] that high heel is a spirit that painting
[2:07:41] there is a spirit
[2:07:45] glory
[2:07:48] ever here take that away
[2:07:51] because that spirit will remain on you
[2:07:53] as long as you have nothing he has a
[2:07:56] claim on you
[2:08:02] lord help me
[2:08:04] and his servant came near and spoke unto
[2:08:07] him and say my father
[2:08:10] if the prophet
[2:08:11] had beated to do some great things
[2:08:15] would not
[2:08:17] would that not have done it
[2:08:19] if they would have asked you for your
[2:08:21] healing bring a million dollars
[2:08:24] you will go to your bank account and
[2:08:26] bring it
[2:08:27] they didn't ask you money they didn't
[2:08:29] tell you fast they didn't tell you god
[2:08:32] to honor that prayer they didn't tell
[2:08:34] you oh they told you go to the water one
[2:08:36] two three four five six seven eight
[2:08:38] seven boom out it's finished what is the
[2:08:41] problem
[2:08:46] hallelujah
[2:08:47] how much rather than when he said to
[2:08:50] thee watch and be what
[2:08:53] very easy people don't expect it
[2:08:56] because when we talked about them oh the
[2:08:58] seventh seal the day it's gonna be open
[2:09:00] oh all heaven will be there the seven
[2:09:02] seal is simple we show it to you here
[2:09:06] the trumpets are not complicated the top
[2:09:08] and alcohol is simple as they simple
[2:09:11] it's not complicated
[2:09:13] [Music]
[2:09:20] it is the simplicity
[2:09:23] of the gospel that staggered the water
[2:09:27] they tried to make it a great
[2:09:29] intellectual
[2:09:31] something another when it's the water
[2:09:34] but god takes the very tool of water
[2:09:39] and water
[2:09:40] and water
[2:09:41] to work his work with it
[2:09:44] that
[2:09:44] is two in god's water
[2:09:47] it's very simple
[2:09:51] oh brother stephen will preach
[2:09:52] sanctification
[2:09:53] let's get ready how are we going to get
[2:09:55] started because you are waiting for
[2:09:56] something to do
[2:10:00] want a formula
[2:10:01] easy
[2:10:02] you know the same way you confess for
[2:10:04] healing that's the same way you get
[2:10:05] sanctified

[2:52:04] [Music]
[2:52:08] you are blocking the holy ghost because
[2:52:09] of a high-heeled shoe
[2:52:11] you are blocking the holy ghost because
[2:52:13] of your haircut you are blocking the
[2:52:15] holy ghost because of your friend you
[2:52:17] are blocking the holy ghost because of
[2:52:19] something very simple
[2:52:21] that shoe will be destroyed your nail
[2:52:24] doesn't make you pretty you didn't burn
[2:52:26] with those nails like that
[2:52:30] the makeup you put in this is not the
[2:52:31] way you are
[2:52:33] you trying to change your skin or your
[2:52:34] complexion god did not create you like
[2:52:36] that
[2:52:38] it's an insult to god
[2:52:43] anybody here
[2:52:44] god say separate yourself from your
[2:52:47] kingdom
[2:52:48] that is what you have to do a lot of
[2:52:50] times separate yourself from a lot of
[2:52:52] unbelief and remember until abraham
[2:52:56] fully obey god the blessing never come
[2:53:00] until he water
[2:53:02] he took his daddy along he caused
[2:53:05] trouble and that lord finally caused
[2:53:08] trouble and the headsman and then as
[2:53:10] soon as he got separated from everything
[2:53:13] he fully obeyed when he come to full
[2:53:16] obedience then god brought the water
[2:53:20] when god expects you to do a special
[2:53:23] thing he demanded complete separation
[2:53:27] from any doubt you got to come to full
[2:53:30] obedience to obey what he says god
[2:53:33] demands it
[2:53:34] you cannot do
[2:53:36] no other way he always set an example
[2:53:39] and that was his example of a complete
[2:53:42] separation from all his family all his
[2:53:45] kindred and so forth to work a life
[2:53:47] separated to god
[2:53:49] what are you concluding brother stephen

[2:53:55] what believe accept and full obedience
[2:53:58] to the whole world will intention you to
[2:54:00] the token full obedience not the part of

[2:57:30] friends some of you on the telephone you
[2:57:32] know where your struggle is
[2:57:34] you know where your weaknesses are you
[2:57:36] know what you're doing that you know
[2:57:39] clearly it's not good according to the
[2:57:41] word of god according to the message
[2:57:44] that we preach that we believe
[2:57:47] i'm going to move forward
[2:57:50] i will not continue repeating
[2:57:53] i'm gonna move forward

[2:58:10] responsible for it
[2:58:12] because the word has been preached
[2:58:14] i cannot spin around here i have to move
[2:58:17] forward let's pray heavenly father
[2:58:20] lord we are approaching you again humbly
[2:58:22] father thanking you for your grace
[2:58:25] for your love and for your mercy and for
[2:58:28] everything you have been doing for us
[2:58:31] father
[2:58:33] a simple key
[2:58:35] obedience
[2:58:37] but it's a great key
[2:58:39] because that's the last greatest test
[2:58:41] that abraham had
[2:58:43] after you did so many things for abraham
[2:58:46] but still
[2:58:48] you are still looking for that final
[2:58:50] touch
[2:58:51] to make sure
[2:58:52] abraham
[2:58:54] is a good hair
[2:58:55] until you could testify
[2:58:57] when you came down
[2:58:59] and you want to destroy sodom you say
[2:59:02] shall i hide
[2:59:04] anything to abraham
[2:59:06] because i know abraham will teach his
[2:59:08] children
[2:59:10] how to behave correctly
[2:59:12] and you took abraham assad
[2:59:14] and you even give him the privilege to
[2:59:16] be able to plead for his family
[2:59:19] because you look at abraham father and
[2:59:22] you see something that is like you
[2:59:25] abraham had weaknesses abraham lied
[2:59:30] david had weaknesses
[2:59:32] many of them all of them had weaknesses
[2:59:35] but father the key
[2:59:37] they knew
[2:59:38] how to repent
[2:59:40] and they knew how to let go and they
[2:59:43] knew how to obey and sometimes you bring
[2:59:46] trial
[2:59:47] and heartache
[2:59:49] just to make sure we understand a
[2:59:51] certain language
[2:59:53] but father if he doesn't take your grace
[2:59:56] there is no way we can make it
[2:59:58] because who can make a man obey
[3:00:01] if it's not you lord
[3:00:03] father you the one that can give abraham
[3:00:06] such a faith to be able to take his own
[3:00:09] son and bind him and not only then bind
[3:00:12] him but even be able to take the knife
[3:00:15] and pull it up
[3:00:17] father already straighten his heart to
[3:00:19] kill isaac
[3:00:21] but father when you saw that
[3:00:23] determination
[3:00:24] that abraham can love him above all his
[3:00:28] treasure above even his own son
[3:00:31] father you say abraham let loose
[3:00:34] and you provided the land to show him
[3:00:37] that now i know that all the family of
[3:00:40] the earth will be blessed by thee father
[3:00:43] made this church
[3:00:44] understand the key to obedience
[3:00:47] father to let loose
[3:00:49] and may every spirit of stubbornness
[3:00:52] every spirit of rebellion
[3:00:55] every spirit of peer pressure every
[3:00:58] spirit of complexes to try to please
[3:01:01] people or to seek attention or to seek
[3:01:04] approval from everybody
[3:01:07] father may you break those complexes
[3:01:10] may your people be completely free
[3:01:13] and to make sure that they are not send
[3:01:16] in this world
[3:01:17] to be the pleasers of men
[3:01:20] the pleasers of friend
[3:01:21] the pleasers of families but to be
[3:01:24] pleaser of you and to make sure that you
[3:01:27] have preeminence you have the first
[3:01:29] place in their life that's all you
[3:01:32] require you require the same thing unto
[3:01:34] jesus christ which was to have
[3:01:37] preeminence and you did have preeminence
[3:01:40] in christ and you are requiring the
[3:01:42] preeminence into the blood and once the
[3:01:44] bread gives you preeminence
[3:01:47] what else can you withhold
[3:01:49] what else can you not give us because
[3:01:51] you will give everything to those that
[3:01:54] obey us
[3:01:55] that obey you father this is what we
[3:01:58] want to do lord sometimes we are born
[3:02:00] with complexes from a family strength
[3:02:03] that we battling with a spirit of
[3:02:06] rebellion and suppleness father but you
[3:02:09] the god that breaks circle lord may you
[3:02:12] break every genetic lord
[3:02:15] that is connected to stubbornness to
[3:02:18] disobedience
[3:02:20] every intellectual spirit
[3:02:22] every religious theological intellectual
[3:02:26] spirit that will be reasoning against
[3:02:28] the word of god because they don't want
[3:02:30] to let go something they still want to
[3:02:33] please themselves they still want to
[3:02:35] make sure they fit with the fashion of
[3:02:37] this world to make sure they can blend
[3:02:39] with the people outside and with the
[3:02:42] people inside to make sure they can
[3:02:45] further satisfy this flesh
[3:02:47] not knowing that they are grieving the
[3:02:50] holy spirit
[3:02:51] that is taking report day by day to give
[3:02:54] report to the father to make sure that
[3:02:57] the cargo is fully loaded and it's not
[3:03:00] shaken so that they can seal and seal
[3:03:03] forever the kingdom that faith that
[3:03:06] justified them that moved them into the
[3:03:08] whole new place and further now entering
[3:03:11] into the holiest that you want to sell
