to give a quick testimony um you know last night there was some bad weather came through and we found out just a little while ago we knew there was a lot of damage in Cherryville and I look they said that there is a Taco Bell in there that they thought it was a tornado um and I could hear it it didn't sound like you know they always say it sounds like a hundred trains this didn't sound like that but I looked on the map and we're only three miles from that Taco Bell so we just learned on the on the right here that it was what they call a microburst and uh it flipped cars it tore up a car wash it tore up the um the Taco Bell it's just a burst of air they said two and a half miles usually two and a half miles in diameter we were we're three miles from this thing so it's just a big thing of air that just comes downward and just just boom and it just tore the place up um I think Chris wrote up there to see what see what was going on but there was a lot of traffic because people were I think being nosy and the rescue people they were having to bring people out and rescue them our power went out for a little while and we prayed and prayed and prayed and it finally came on it finally we were blessed in that aspect besides being blessed that we were not affected by this thing I could see it and I could hear it uh it wasn't like a tornado but it was very devastating and the good Lord spared us we've had yeah we're very thankful he's looking after it you know we're trying to build our little farm and uh and and this it it we've had tornadoes we've told in the past it's came through our property and tore stuff up and we're just very thankful that it didn't happen amen so we're going to invite sister Grace Walker a man to give us a special tonight amen amen amen amen let's

Jesus Jesus Jesus is the name of the Lord Jesus is the name of the Lord Jesus is the name of the Lord amen you believe in tonight is my microphone good praise God I got a new device so I'm just testing it tonight to see how we're going to blow up the devil amen amen amen sister Grace what a singing oh my I felt like I was back at work because in my work we I played music since I started it's uh gospel music all the way I finished 365 days that I'm working if I'm working 365. and that song always play any kid because our customers my what Pandora so I know a lot of patients ask me which station I say this is my own customers so I took everything crazy away but that song goes also a lot and when he plays I always think about sister zadi and sister yoga but because the way she climbed higher so I don't want to do it because so I always say I say maybe sister's Daddy can get it and sister your Quebec can climb higher back and forth and today I find somebody who did it glory to God I'm telling you this broad Got Talent my goodness wow praise God that was wonderful congratulations I don't see brother in mind you about telling brother Stephen say congratulations amen glory be to know the name of the Lord Brother Bob you think I'm gonna crush it I will not forget you good to see you big buddy wonderful amen this is always home when you hear you feel like home you dance it like home you shot like on your clap hand like home you home okay good to see you my brother wonderful brother Greg has always been there it's good to have good friend that can stick more than the brother when we need them amen that is wonderful they have been a tremendous help for brother Bob says with specialist sister Sandy you don't know what's going behind the scene but God knows all one day at the day when we get there you will be like oh my God this is what was going on exactly we are true family of the Living God Amen yeah you put me on uh when I was following the channel of the sermon now I got two sermon on Sunday that are going back and forth back and forth so I don't know which one to load and to shoot because somebody started with the Original Seed and now they go back they say the day of redemption and I'm like oh my God I thought the Original Seed I'm gonna use the second bullet and here is again the day of redemption amen oh my God how many got clear with the voice of the Archangel and the Trump everything clear the whole church clear nobody was lost somewhere okay because people come up and say okay when Jesus is descending he's doing all three in one shot if you put it like that whatever happened on Sunset Mountain should have raised the dead and change everybody and most of you were not even born so how can the Rapture happen in 1963 and you still around here then we're going to come up with a doctrine of millennium you in a millennium getting married you don't understand what you're doing amen amen that's not the case so I have to just open those Gap and show you that God may speak something one time but the way it's fulfilled because the way he interpret the word that is the way the way he fulfilled his word that is his own interpretation amen so don't push the interpretation just go he say Elijah Elijah you're going to do this but when he comes up Elijah only did one the remaining was done and there is the shot there is the voice of the Archangel there is the trumpet of God brother Branham only did one he delivered the shout and that was it but when it comes to the voice of the Archangel and the trumpet of God that will bring the resurrection of the Dead Brother Branham is waiting on us to fulfill that part that is the ministry of Elijah the two remain to Elijah Elisha and the first one remained to Elijah so the first one remained to brother Branham to blow the trumpet but the remaining of the ministry he needs to go sit down while the bride is preparing so you pray for me because they pulled the Original Seed and we need to go back to the seed and see how we are having our body changes but there is a power with that seed remember that seed is another you that is forming amen now we need to understand how to distinguish you and you there is to use amen amen if you know how to work with that guy you will see how powerful you can be because we usually say you can create word who create word who does it is it you or you amen is he you or is it you you need to know who who can make world to come up if you don't know that's why you speak and nothing happened because who's speaking is he you or you now you need to know how is you or when is he you or when is you only that I lost someone so you pray for me if I'm gonna start there or I need to pull the shout because Matthew 25 have a layer that is connected right there but I don't know the song leader got me move forward so let's see maybe the preaching of the word will tell me which direction to go with amen glory to God young Brothers it's on Saturday Lord's willing here at 2 30. I believe I got enough question so tonight was the last one so if you were lingering on your question you keep it for the next uh oncoming meeting amen you know who's preaching tonight right it's brother Daryl Ward it says been a long time you know brother Daryl Ward you know he moved better I learned this ministry when I was in the old church and I could select them and I say I know this is caliber we need them amen so I told him he's home when you're home you preach like home you dance like home we pull like home and we do everything like home so pull on the gift of the Lord God have something for us tonight let's hear what our father want to say tonight amen only believe [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh they believe [Music] all things possible make yourself more my brothers Lord I believe Lord I believe [Music] all these are possible [Music] Lord I believe Lord I believe [Music] all things are possible [Music] Lord I believe amen praise the Lord you know that's the only thing he ever asked us to do was to believe if those can believe all things are possible you know the Bible says with man it shall not be possible but then it says with man it can be possible what's the difference because one man believes that thoughts can't believe all things are possible with God and all things are possible with you is that is that the scripture amen amen if you have your Bibles this evening the service of the book of Acts when we read from Acts chapter 28 starting at verse one we're greach in the name of the Lord Jesus and counted an honor to be with you once again we always enjoy coming this way certainly enjoyed the song service and as our brother said there sure is a lot of talent here among God's people amen and praise the Lord I'm so glad you know we're living in a time that the the world has absolutely lost its mind they've just lost their mind and the prophet told us it would be that way and it's that way amen we're not just reading the quotes anymore we're living them [Applause] yeah amen and I'm so glad that I'm with a group of people tonight who has also lost our minds [Applause] because we've got the mind of Christ we know what he wants done with his word amen praise the Lord so what a privilege it is tonight to have the mind of Christ amen so may the Lord richly bless you just believe tonight whatever you have need of that he's certainly able to meet it in this service you know a crowd this size we know there's needs but there's not a need here greater than our Lord amen so we just Look to Him Acts chapter 28 starting at verse 1 we certainly appreciate brother Stephen allowing us to come and may the Lord bless you be our prayer the Bible says this and when they were escaped then they knew that the island was called Melita and the barbarious people showed us no little kindness for the Kindle the fire and received us every one because of the present Reign and because of the cold and when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire there came a viper out of the Heat and fastened on his hand and when The Barbarians saw that the venomous beasts hang on his hand they said among themselves no doubt this man is a murderer whom though he hath escaped the sea yet Vengeance suffereth not to live and it's something that people always think the worst amen but Paul he shook off the Beast Into the Fire and felt no harm and how Beth they looked when he should have swollen or fallen down dead suddenly but after they had looked a great while and saw no harm come to him they changed their minds and said that he was a god how fast their opinion of Paul changed from being a murderer to a god which snaked in him met faith [Music] [Applause] and that's what we want to speak on this evening When Faith was met Amen Let Us bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we counted such a privilege to gather here with your children this evening father I pray that you'd come and take these thoughts dear God and Quicken it to the hearts of your children that we can rise up and receive that Lord which you've already done for us father God I pray that tonight that your spirit would just move among your children and those that dear God that would maybe be weak or tired Lord or maybe depressed or maybe sick or whatever the need would be Lord may they look to you tonight father we pray and Lord you see this need of sister Erica Lord as once again we bring her name before you father God may you just touch our sister Lord knowing dear God that you're the Healer and the sustainer of Our Lives Lord we commit this congregation and ourselves into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus name and the bride says God bless you Saints you may be seated now brother Branham told us that perfect Faith Masters all circumstances perfect Faith Masters all circumstances no matter what it is it Masters it he says now just watch when you believe anything or do anything you've got to have faith in what you're doing and Faith Masters that circumstance when you believe anything or do anything you've got to have faith in what you're doing then when we come through these doors here to have church we need to come with the understanding that we didn't come to see what's happening we come because we are what's happening we need to come with the understanding that I'm not here by accident that God put me here he could have put me in Luther's day or Wesley's day or the restoration of the gifts but God in his great wisdom chose this day this time this season amen this ain't Luther's day he's had his day this ain't Wesley's day they've had their day but this is the bride time Bride season bride light the manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God come on somebody this is the hour Hallelujah when the prophet of God said that the bride is bone and flesh of Jesus Christ amen this is the hour this is who we are we're not going to be but we are now Sons and Daughters of God the prophet said I didn't come to mix up a Doctrine but I come to straighten one out to get away from this fear and the scare that you don't know who you are he said you're not going to be but you are now Sons and Daughters of God you always were Sons and Daughters of God and we need to come through those doors by faith believing that God put us here to tear Satan's kingdom down hallelujah we're not here to lose we're not here to actually survive but we are here for a rapture yes sir I said we are here for a Rapture amen and Faith Masters that circumstance you see faith is not a Hocus Pocus it's not a magic wand that you wave over somebody faith is not what you feel it's what you believe and faith has to have a resting place and the word of God is the foundation that Faith rests upon the Bible says the Romans 3 4 let God be true and every man a liar the Bible said Heaven's the nurse shall pass away but not one word of God will fail then we can sit here this evening with this confidence that God's word does not lie [Applause] God will do what he said he will do amen Nations will lie to us governments will lie to us politicians they'll lie to us and sometimes even people who are close to us will lie to us our feelings will lie to us our emotions will lie to us Sensations will lie to us but the word of God will never lie to us and every word of God is just as true as every word of God it's either all true or none of it's true God said let there be light is there light did God keep his word that same God said behold I send you Elijah did he do it did he keep his word that same God said I am the Lord thy God who heals all thy diseases Hallelujah he is the Healer amen or you say I go to the doctor you break your arm the doctor can said it but who does the healing oh healing comes from God now how does God prove his word god proves his word by bringing it to pass hey the father said oh hell I love him God always keeps his word he will keep his word every time [Applause] not 99 times out of 100. think about that 99 times I bet Vegas would like to have those odds that every time you pull that handle 99 times out of 100 you're going to win that might be something for Vegas but it ain't good enough for God for the prophet said not 99. not 99 times out of 100 but 100 times out of a hundred God will keep his word and Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God when you hear what the word is saying to you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] what the word is saying to you you see it's got to be a personal revelation what is the new birth brother Venom it's Christ revealed to you personally you have met this person amen you say I believe the message the devil believes the message you've got to have the experience not enough to prophesake just to talk about the token but the hour has come that we must apply the token Hallelujah Hallelujah do you love him [Applause] when you hear what the word is saying to you when the word becomes to like the little boy the prophet talked about had never saw a mirror and he went there to his grandma's house or this aunt's house or wherever and there was the mirror and when he first saw it he thought he had to play me he waved and the boy waved back he smiled and the boy smiled back and he got closer and closer and closer and finally he touched the mirror and the Revelation struck him he said well Mama it's me and we need to look into the mirror of the word and get closer and closer and closer and closer till you come to the understanding it's me the word is speaking of me amen Hallelujah Hallelujah that moment that Mary realized that Isaiah was prophesying a virgin shall conceive that moment that the Revelation struck her I am the prophecy of Isaiah made flesh and let me say this bride hallelujah it's the manifestation of the prophets prophecy concerning the bride [Applause] well you think there'll be a bride I'm looking at her Hallelujah Hallelujah [Music] then no matter what the circumstance is that's not what that don't have one thing to do with it well the doctor says it's bad the situation is impossible circumstances has nothing to do with it [Applause] Faith Masters that circumstance Faith beliefs that God will work it out I don't know how he's going to do it but you see I don't have to know how he's going to do it many times she don't ask us to understand he just asked us can you trust me the Bible said that all things weren't too good then no matter what you're facing right now no matter what you're dealing with right now it's for your good how do you know that the word said so and God's word does not lie I think no matter what we're dealing with in our life it's bringing us to that place oh God it's bringing us to that image that God had of us in his mind before there was a woman [Applause] amen see Faith Masters you see Faith Masters all circumstance and faith and love is a relation because you can't have faith unless you've got love because your faith is in a God Who is the very essence of love and faith and love works together you see if he loved me enough to die for me then he loves me enough to heal me he loves him enough to save me he loves me love to deliver me to forgive me to Rapture me and you have faith in The God Who Loves You Hallelujah do you have faith in the God who loves you and in faith in what the word is saying about you [Applause] [Music] you've got to read the Bible like a love story [Applause] Faith Masters every circumstance because it's not what you feel it's not what you see it's not what you understand or what you reason out it's what you believe [Applause] when you hear what the word is saying about you then that word takes preeminence the word takes preeminence over every circumstance when you see yourself in the scriptures [Applause] like Paul in Acts 23 10 when thy Rose the great dissension and the chief Captain Fearless Paul should be pulled into pieces of them commanded the soldiers to go down and get him and take him by force from among them and bring him into the castle and the night following the Lord stood by him had said be of good cheer Paul for as thou has testified of me in Jerusalem so must thou be witness of me and Rome so where is Paul headed he's headed to Rome why God said so how's it going to get there circumstances does not matter he'll get there because the word said he'll get there well how do we go to the Rapture brother Daryl it's looking so bad it's looking so dark will Rapture Hallelujah because the word sadly will circumstances has nothing to do with it Hallelujah we'll get there because God said so and on his way there arose a great storm and 14 days and nights no man ate anything now this must have been some kind of a storm because you know how we like to eat 14 days and nights but after a long absences Paul stood forth in the midst of them and said sirs you should have hearkened unto me and not have loose from clay to have gained this harm and lost and now I exhort you to be of good cheer for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you but of the ship for there stood by me this night this angel of God whose I am and whom I serve saying fear not Paul thou must be brought before Caesar and lo God hath given thee all them that sell with thee so what did the angel do the angel didn't come and bring him a new word he just come and reminded him of what God already said [Applause] foreign Hallelujah the angel messenger that came to us didn't come to bring us something new but to restore us back to the original word amen Hallelujah not a new doctrine but to take the Loose Ends and bring it all back together that you could see the picture and what does the word make it makes Christ Hallelujah [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah fear not Paul you're not gonna die why God's word said you must go to Rome you're going to be a witness of me at Rome Paul said we're forcers be of good cheer for I believe God you believe what God Said then be happy what are you worried about poop they gonna do one thing but what God allows him to do well he's threatened a nuclear war but the prophet of God said if they push that button before one bomb hits this nation we will be gone what are you worried about be of good cheer for I believe God [Applause] and the ship finally broke up from the storm just like they said and taking pieces of the ship Paul and the others went to shore now Paul didn't say now look boys I'm the church age messenger I'm the man of the hour I'm a prophet of God so I'm going to lay back here now you all go out there and get that wood be careful no you see Paul had a correct revelation he was a servant to the people and let me say the ministry Hallelujah the bride is not a servant to the ministry but the ministry is the servant to the bride the gift that's in a man's life is not for himself it's for you and if God is placed the gifted behind her at this pulpit in our brother you should respect it and honor it because God placed it here he placed it come on somebody he placed it here to bring us to perfection God chose man to preach the gospel he never chose the Stars he never chose the moon he never chose tape players [Applause] [Music] he chose man [Applause] how do you know that brother Daryl the prophet said so [Applause] Paul goes out gathers up some wood to so they could get warm and when he goes up together some kindling and as he goes to put the fire the wood into the fire a snake struck him right on the hand now this snake was so deadly that they just sat down to watch him die they never even offered a Band-Aid there ain't no need to get no first aid kit you'll be dead before you get it open this snake was so deadly that they sat down to watch him die and they said this man must have done some kind of evil to escape the storm and now be struck by this snake you see the Venom of the snake it attacks the nervous system and though it would it's they start to lose the the inability to breathe and then they start swelling up it shuts down the nervous system and then it shuts down the breathing and then they swell up they no need to call 9-1-1 you'd be dead before you got the one dog so they just sat down to watch it sat down to watch him die he must have done some kind of evil and the Venom did it body it absolutely bitty and the Venom started up his arm just like it done to every person that it bit the Venom was doing what it was designed to do but all at once the Venom met faith and with the Venom met faith faith in the word that says you've got to go to Rome you've got to appear before Caesar and when Paul took God's word over the Venom God took the poison out of the Venom and when the Venom met Faith there was no more poison ball took the word of God over the fear of a deadly snake bite [Music] the word of God cast out fear he just pitched it over into the fire and gathered more wood and the people of the island said this man ain't a murderer he's a god you see it wasn't Paul saying I'm a God it was them saying it [Applause] so you mean to tell me when a Son of God by faith takes the word of God into his heart and speaks it back upon his lips it's just the same as dearly speaking deity God in flesh you see God just didn't want to be above us nor did God just want to be with us but God's ultimate desire was to be in US it's no longer Christ in a major it's Christ in you [Applause] they said this man's a god so when a man believes the word of God the spoken concerning him and manifests that word it's just the same as deity did not Jesus say if you can if you can't believe me believe the works that I do for they tell you who I am [Applause] the three Hebrew children stay true to God's word and would not bow their knee to the king's commandment so what did he do he heated up the furnace seven times hotter than it ever been heated so hot that it killed the men who threw them in it think of the insanity they burned their own men trying to kill Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and let me say tonight the devil will destroy his own kingdom trying to stop this bride but he will never stop this bride [Applause] she is unmovable she is Unstoppable she is undefeatable come on somebody [Applause] those three Hebrew Boys in that fire they testified our God is able to Deliver Us from this furry furnace they were the Seed of Abraham and they had a promise of God that his seed would possess the enemy's Gates [Applause] and when the king's fiery furnace meant faith in what God told their father Abraham well let me say that again when the Kings fiery furnace that faith Faith took the Heat and the smoke out of the fire you see the fire was still there I said the fire was still there because see if the king had looked in and saw no fire he'd have just lit it again but when he saw the fire and they wasn't burning he couldn't understand it but they understood it that faith in God's word can take the Heat and the smoke out of the fire [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh Hallelujah oh Hallelujah I want to be where the waters cannot overturn me in the presence of God [Applause] I want to be where the Blazing Flames cannot burn me in your presence oh God hallelujah in his presence amen Hallelujah what about Daniel thrown in the Lion's Den and the Lions knew they had an easy meal ain't nowhere for the man to go no doubt they thought this is a Happy Meal you see no doubt they had eight humans before and they had an appetite for human flesh and when they saw him with nowhere to go they said yum yum here we come but when the Lions met faith [Applause] Faith locked their jaws amen when the pillar of fire stood between Daniel and those Lions the Lions went off into the corner and meowed like kittens [Applause] they went from the Roar of the line to meow meow that's not the bible say that Satan is as a roaring lion but we've got the Revelation he's just a kitten Hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah and when faith when the Lions meant faith it locked their jaws when the woman with the blood issue 12 years of bleeding and it would not stop when she went into the town she had to yell unclean unclean humiliated embarrassed spent over money and after she spent all her money the doctor said we can't help you wouldn't have been nice if they told her that the first visit instead of taking her money and then confess it come on somebody brother you believe in doctors yeah I believe in doctors but when they say they can't help us I know somebody who can [Applause] [Music] [Applause] when my daughter was hurt in the accident two of my family was killed and the doctor said they couldn't help her I said I know somebody who can oh Hallelujah she spent all of her money but she saw Jesus and pressing through as her sister sang about and pressing through the cloud she believed that Jesus was the Christ and she said if I can only touch the hill of His Garment she believed if she touched him she'd get what she asked for and she slipped through the crowd [Applause] she must have been smaller stature because notice she never touched him on the shoulder she never touched him on the arm [Music] so no doubt she could even reach over the crowd to touch him so she had to Humble herself down that's what we need to do we need to Humble ourselves down sometimes we just need to admit I need help [Applause] come on somebody sometimes you just got to be honest and say God I need you she was willing to Humble herself down and maybe reach through their legs just to Touch the Hem of His garnish and when she touched him Jesus Stood Still [Applause] she believed if she touched him she'd get what she asked for believing that what she said would happen notice Jesus never said if you touch me you'll get well Jesus never said it Peter Peter never said listen come here I see you've got a need but I've been walking with the master and I know how to get his attention Peter never said it Jesus never said it who said If I Could Touch His Garment not Jesus not Peter her [Applause] her faith that he was the Christ brought her own words into manifestation and her words her words became the very word of God we read Hallelujah Hallelujah Faith Hallelujah faith in them said Christ being the Son of God it brought her words into manifestation [Applause] and with a blood issue that eluded the doctors for 12 years meant Faith the bleeding stopped why Faith Masters every circumstance [Music] I think of Joshua God told Joshua I want you to March around the walls of Jericho and they'll fall before you now the walls of Jericho they say some say that they were 46 foot high and 80 foot wide that you can race chariots around the top of it and if you Bible readers know rahab's house was setting on top the wall so that's how big these walls were 46 foot high 80 foot thick and God said now Joshua I want you to go up there March around it so many times sound a trumpet and you all let out a shout and the wall is going to fall down [Music] you want us to March around the walls blow a trumpet let us Shout and the walls are going to fall down [Music] do we need a record bar nope backhoe bulldozer case of dynamite what do I need just obedience to my word March blow a trumpet Shout that is so silly to the carnal mind [Applause] you see Joshua knew how thick those walls was because he built plenty of them in Egypt he knew what went in them he knew how tight they were he knew how thick they were so Joshua had to lean not to his own understanding not to his medical knowledge no sir he could not lead to that or Hallelujah he had to lead to God's word [Applause] he did not lead to his own understanding he believed that what God Said was the truth and he obeyed his word and the walls fell down Lena not to his own understanding Joshua looked at the Unseen he walked around the walls believing it would happen you see it all depends on what you're looking at you see if you get the correct Revelation you can shout the victory before you ever have it [Applause] [Music] you know you take a football team when it's Fourth and 40. fourth down 40 yards for a touchdown ain't too many of them shouting because they don't know if they're going to make it or not but when they throw that Hail Mary and the guy tipped it tipped it and pulls it in the place Goes Wild because they scored a touchdown but you see we're different we could shout the victory before we ever score see when I was in the army they gave me a steel pot they gave me an M16 rifle with a banana Cliff that held 18 rounds they gave me them 203 you may know what a 203 is there you thinking m-203 was a grenade launcher and they gave it to me because I was on the firing range shooting the rifle and I took one shot and he said you'll be the grenade carrier because you don't have to be accurate just close so I carried it the whole time I was in the Army and M16 with the m203 and you with the the grenade it looked like a big shotgun shell and you stick it in it put it under your arm and go Boop and I carried it they gave me combat boots they gave me a helmet they gave me we called it a steel pot they gave me an M16 an m203 I was on a 155 Hauser that fired up 102 pound projectile 18 miles on a Max charge of a green eight a green bag charge eight Green Bank shoot around 100 around 100 pound around 18 miles they gave me all this to defend this nation they gave me this to fight battles but there's one thing they never gave me they never gave me the promise of the victory [Applause] but when I got into God's Army he gave me a helmet of salvation he's shot in the feet with the preparation of the Gospel he gave me the shield of Faith the sword of the word but God gave me the promise of the victory he said look at the back of the book you win then we can stop the victory before we ever have the battle Hallelujah Hallelujah with walls 46 foot high and 80 foot thick met Faith the walls came down [Applause] jairus's daughter lay dead and the mourner said trouble not the master anymore your little girl is dead just a there's something about that word that's so final but always remember we serve a God who raises the Dead [Applause] but that word is so final and when they told him trouble not the master your little girl is dead you're too late but Jesus gave Jairus the remedy to every bad report when he touched him on the shoulder and said only believe [Applause] Jesus standing at the grave of Lazarus a man that had been dead four days corruption had done set in even his sister said Lord he stinks but when a dead man met a man who had faith in what the word said he was death gave way to life when he cried out lies with come forth the maniac of kadera demons had him bound the Bible said he lived among the tombs cut himself with stones and they tried to chain him and they tried to tame him they tried to make him a good Baptist or a Methodist gave him a few quote books in a picture [Music] and he would do good for a while then that would come upon him and he'd tear off his clothes and go back among the Dead the Bible said he broke the chains and the feathers and no man could tame him but what man couldn't do Faith could what brought Jesus to the gallerians it wasn't the mayor yeah it wasn't an organization that invited you it wasn't the pig Farmers they asked him to leave what brought Jesus to the gallerience it was a maniac who was living in the tombs cutting his flesh ripping off his clothes but he wanted help and that needy Soul was crying out for deliverance at Jesus on the other side of the sea heard his invite of faith and Jesus crossed the stormy sea to get to one for the sake of one's soul and he's the same one tonight he'll come from glory to One sneedy Soul sitting in this humble church tonight he's the same yesterday today and forever he'll come every time where he's wounded he'll come every time where he's wounded [Applause] but he will never come where he's doubted [Applause] [Music] he'll come every time where he's wanted but he never come comes where he's doubted so if you doubting him just remember he'll never be at your door you see that's why some people see Jesus every time they come to church because their faith declares he's here others come and never seen because they lean to their own understanding to their feelings well I don't feel nothing so feelings got nothing to do with it you can get a goosebump from the air conditioner come on somebody and I'm not against those things but I'm just telling you that's we don't base it on that he never said did you feel it he said did you believe it you see Jesus heard this Maniacs Cry of faith and if you heard his Cry of Faith he's no respect of persons he'll hear your cry and that great storm could not stop Jesus from coming it could not drowned out that cry of Faith there is no hope thank you Lord there is nothing that Satan has that can stop Faith from touching Jesus touching Jesus is all that really matters and then your life will never be the same there's only one way to touch you you must believe when you call on his name brother Ben said when Faith from an honest heart meets God them cogs just comes together like that something has to take place I challenge this audience in the name of Jesus Christ let your faith connect with God like that and in a few minutes you'll have another Pentecost there'll be such a Revival breakout in this town there won't be enough cops in the country to keep them down there'll be a real Revival when your faith from an honest heart meets God and hold on to your false teeth this is a good one right here the prophet said you don't go to hell because you're a sinner you don't go to hell because you're a sinner we was born in sin shape of the iniquity we had nothing to do with it come on somebody if we'd had a choice we'd have never been born that way but we didn't have a choice Eve got us into this mess I believe I will [Applause] you don't go to hell because you're a sinner you go to hell because you refuse to accept the way away from hell there's a bypass and that's Christ there's a bypass from your sickness a quick death a premature grave and that's through Christ you sinned in the beginning but Christ died for your sins therefore he saved you when he died he saved you and he healed you when he died for he took your place [Applause] so he saved me and healed me at the same time and all you have to do is accept it by faith and you'll receive it there's nothing more to be done because your healing is already paid for you can have it right this afternoon you can have it right now this very minute when you believe it when your faith meets God's requirements now I was in a restaurant the other day and the waitress come by and she said will there be anything else and I said no ma'am just just to check she said well somebody saw you in here and they paid for it and I said well let me leave a tip and they said no no they left the tip too she said so if you don't need nothing else you can go so you see I could have done one or two things I could have accepted that it was already paid for or I could have argued [Music] I could have said ma'am I don't see nobody in this restaurant that I know are you sure you've got the right table [Applause] are you you're not pulling my leg you want me to go out that door so that Bella Ding and you can holler he stole the stake I could have sat there and argued all evening I could have demanded no ma'am I'm paying for it or I could have accepted it and walked out with a belly full of steak well if that's true for the restaurant that's true for that quote it's already paid for it you don't have to argue about it you don't have to reason it out you don't have to try to figure it out you can just accept it he's my healer he's my deliverer Hallelujah he's my son he's my brother he's my king he's my physician he's my comfort he's my joy he's my Beast Hallelujah I said Hallelujah yeah I say accept it tonight I say receive it tonight [Music] I say Let's Take God at his word [Applause] gonna have just a few more minutes [Applause] now I want to look at this before I close because I I think this is very good I want you to listen to this [Applause] hope versus faith no listen to this hope will agree with the Bible hope will say it's true hope will say I believe every bit of it hope will say I believe that's the word of God hope will say I believe that God keeps his promise hope believes all that now everything I read everybody in this building we believe that hope believes that the prophet said hope believes all that but hope then says now I believe God will heal but look at my condition that's the difference between Hope and Faith [Music] hope and believe God till you see the X-ray hope and believe God till you get that pain again come on somebody but not faith Faith don't look at none of that Faith stands out there with power on his chest muscles come on somebody and faith says I believe regardless of the condition yeah faith says I don't care nothing about condition Faith Masters every circumstance when you believe it and take God in his word and say it so and believe it so God will bring it to pass if ye shall say if ye shall say what is it when you're out from under Babylon when you're out from under unbelief when you're out from under superstitions when you after under all these things and you're filled with God's own life your voice is his voice you are I spoke Jesus promised he would heal us if you ask anything in my name I'll do it when you pray believe that you receive what you asked for and you shall have it it's yours believe it comes to pass [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Faith believes it'll come to pass no matter how long it takes I was in a meeting in Ohio and a brother came up we had a mass prayer at the order for everybody and this brother came up he had a bleeding a tumor in his ear had it for three years and he told me he was always embarrassed because it always looked like his ear was dirty he put all kinds of essential oils and all these ointments which I've got nothing against that but he had used all those things and he said it would scab over and then it would come off and then it would bleed and then it would just over and over and over and over and he came up for that night and all the saints laid hands on one another and the brother goes back to his room lays down goes to sleep gets up the next morning and it's gone [Applause] that's our God that's what God does there's a sister in Cottonwood I was telling brother Stephen before serving a sister down in Cottonwood Arizona had a tumor on her chest and she was putting ointments and stuff on it and that not in the meeting was just just for this like you all doing just worshiping and enjoying the presence of God and she goes home said she took off her blouse and that tumor was gold that's our God does that [Applause] [Music] but God also there's a difference between a miracle and a Healer amen you see the outside world wants you to believe as soon as you come up here to be prayed for and you've got a Twist It Up arm that immediately that arm must straighten out well sometimes it does that's a miracle but whether it does or whether it don't it don't change God's word and the prophet said the outside world wants you to believe as soon as it's prayed for it's just straighten out he said but the trouble of it is Jesus never said that he said lay hands on the sick and they shall recover but he never said when [Applause] [Music] I was in Alton Missouri sister Vera Frost I didn't know her at the time since then I've known she just went to Glory about six months ago but sister very suffered a major stroke and the whole right side of her body was paralyzed and she walked like this right here and her mouth her lips was drawn up towards her ear and she came up for prayer and she said I want you to pray for me I've had a stroke so we prayed for the sister she turned around she drug herself off just like that and Satan said you see there she came up for help and you couldn't help her you know what I told the devil I'm not the Healer Jesus Christ is the Healer he told me lay hands on the Sith they shall recover I did what he told me to do the rest is up to him come on somebody and about a year later I was back down there and this sister come in and carrying deer me and she went upcoming carrying green beans she came in carrying something I said do I know you she said yes you do I said was you here last year when when I was preaching she said yes I was I said wasn't you paralyzed on your right side she said yes I was I said you're doing real good now she said yes I am he is the Healer when you're praying for it and you asked God sincerely we're a unit we're together if we ask God sincerely then God's obligated to take care of what we asked for if you ask anything in my name I'll do it is that true then take your faith and meet whatever it is that's bothering you in Jesus name when a demon-possessed man who lived among the tubes and cut himself day and night with the bondage of change and the afflictions met the Cry of Faith freedom and deliverance came when snake venom that Faith the poison was gone when Lions meant Faith they purred like kittens when fire meant Faith the Heat and smoke was nilated when death meant Faith Life come forth when sickness meant Faith the bleeding stuff when walls meant Faith they fell down when bondage meant Faith the chains were broke then I asked you friends whatever it is that's bothering you whatever's in your way whatever the circumstance may be whatever the bondage is whatever the sickness may be whatever the Furious what's gonna happen when it meets your faith all right Faith In The God Who made the promise Hallelujah I am the Seed of Abraham and he promised me that Abraham's seed shall possess the gates of his enemies [Applause] but your faith we serve the same God Daniel sir we serve the same God Joshua sir we serve the same God he has not lost his power and if he done it for them he'll do it for you do
