Um last Monday was exactly 2 years after the kidney transplant and I want to thank God for um how far he has brought me and also want to thank God for the word that is coming out from the pulpit because he's really transforming us and I want to thank God for that and also thank God for wonderful brethren here and you know wonderful sisters who will always call to check up on on me whenever I'm not feeling well. Yeah. So, um I'm so nervous. Yeah. So, um uh I've been since after I had the kidney transplant. Um I remember the day when I came home that morning, I had to take like more than 10 medications. It was a lot in the morning, afternoon, and evening. And just the sight of the medications will always make me feel nauseous. It was hard. It was so hard. And I remember my husband telling me, "Don't worry. Very soon you'll be off of all this medication." Even though they always say when you had a a transplant, you have to be on medication for the rest of your life, but your case will be different. And I will say amen to it. So um we went I went to see my uh my doctor on Thursday last week Thursday and just going there and hearing her talk to me was so much encouraging like telling me how I'm doing so well and my lab's doing very good kidney functioning is is is at the top and my labs like she was amazed and then there there's this one particular medication that whenever I take whenever you see me at the back or you don't see me in church is that medication. Tomorrow will be the last day I'll be taking that medication. And and amen. Amen. And now the only medication I'm only taking three medications and I want to give glory to God and I believe in that that I will get off all this medication. Amen.

It was uh like an audio quote and it seems like I used part of it before, but I'm like, "Okay, I'm going to load this up on Sunday." And I was sitting right there and begin to get again inspiration for Sunday. Boom, boom, boom. So, I have to write quickly. So, see you on Sunday, Lord's willing. And then we get into this season again. God is God love us so much. &gt;&gt; I mean we have been frustrated for years. &gt;&gt; We don't understand whether our prayer are going through or not. What is going on? Why do we ask certain things it works? Sometime it's not working. Now we begin to understand that everything is working together for good. Even when he say nos, his nose are even better because his nose are pro I mean protective and and and there is always a reason behind it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And at the end of the day we understand the better by and by. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory glory. Hallelujah. I don't have a lot going on but brother Glenn is the one preaching tonight. &gt;&gt; Brother Glenn Kelly is preaching tonight. Amen. It has been a while he's not preaching. So sometime as normal people some people might have some questions and they say well why is everybody preaching? I'm just helping you saying what you don't want to say loud. Amen. That's how I help people. Amen. So you might say why isn't I preaching and this one is preaching. No no no there is nothing wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's just we need to be wise. Amen. &gt;&gt; And know what we are doing. I was talking to somebody last night. I said, "By the brother, I'm say the greatest gift is wisdom." &gt;&gt; Amen. If you look at his age and what he's doing for the kingdom of God, preaching at the prison, deacon going to people's home and checking and going in the hospital, but Glenn is almost more available all the time. He's there staying late being with people. If you use him up too much, you're gonna break him down. And we still need his wisdom. &gt;&gt; This is things minister need to understand. That's why I don't preach often on Wednesday and I don't preach on Wednesday because I got brothers and God have equipped me with brothers here and in church. You need to be wise to understand what God is doing. And with his age, we need to protect his health &gt;&gt; because I need his wisdom. We need his discernment. We need him for the church. So I cannot use him the way I'm using a young man. &gt;&gt; So I'm going to give him some time and then he take his break and once he's available I say now elder you come and then preach. Amen. So for those who have been wondering &gt;&gt; online and local because I got a big audience online, a big church online. So this is the answer. So once in a while you let him preach and we keep him healthy. Amen. So let's sing onlyly believe and pull on the gift of the Lord. Oh believe. [Music] Oh believe. [Music] All things are possible. [Music] All believe [Music] hallelujah. Everlord [Music] I believe I I believe is [Music] all things are possible. Oh, [Music] I believe. Lord, I believe. All things are possible. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Our hearts and mind are clear. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That'll be all musicians. Thank you. &gt;&gt; You know, so writing musicians is getting going to their seats. Uh, brother Steve, he covered for me. I said good. He said everything needed to be said, right? &gt;&gt; So, you know, the enemy always come in, right? And then he tried to mess with your mind. But, you know, we got a little just a few words of encouragement tonight. Uh, how many of the pastor was burning inside of me, you know? So, we went out like he said, by God's grace, it's an honor for me to serve his people. It's an honor for me to do the will of the Lord. It's an honor. So, we give him praise. We give him honor. We give him glory. We thank the pastor and his family and all the uh young ministers there looking at them. I might run down here and grab and get some juice tonight. Huh? You know when these young ministers sitting on the front down here, right? But we just thank you all for your grace and and your mercy and all those uh visible and invisible audience. Uh we thank you for your prayers and all that you do. And so continue to move forward. And God, just have a little thought for us tonight. And the Lord even allow me to share some testimonies what the Lord is allowing us to do out of this ministry sitting up under this ministry here. You know, God's doing some great things. &gt;&gt; Our hearts and mind are clear. &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Lord God, we thank you for your grace, your mercy. We thank you, Father, for the opportunity just to come before your precious children, Lord God, here tonight. Father, strengthen those who had a desire to be here, Lord God, and bless those that are streaming, Lord God, that couldn't make it in tonight, Father. But we look unto the hill to where our strength and our help cometh from, Lord God. We the lot has fallen here tonight, Father. So, we need wisdom. We need the knowledge. We need your understanding. We need revelation to come and speak to your people here tonight. You saw this day. Now, Father, we come to put the Lord Jesus Christ on display here. So, get glory to thy name. Give glory to thy kingdom, Lord God. Do something new, Father, for your people, Father. So, we give you praise. We give you honor. We give you glory. We thank you. And by faith, we claim it all done in Jesus name we pray. Amen. And amen. And we won't keep you standing. Let's turn to two passages of scriptures. Second, we're gonna go to second Timothy, a familiar passage of scripture here. And let's look at chapter three. Second Timothy 3. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And then we'll go to um E Ephesians 6. After that, once you have it, second Timothy 3:16. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. It says all scriptures &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; is given by the inspiration of God. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; And it's for and it's for reproof. I mean pro is profitable doctrine &gt;&gt; for reproof &gt;&gt; for correction &gt;&gt; for instructions &gt;&gt; in righteousness. &gt;&gt; You know that's a powerful scripture. That's a divine you're talking about a divine revelation there. because that scripture is coming from the inspiration of God. Okay. And our topic tonight, the word fortified by inspiration. &gt;&gt; The word being fortified by inspiration. The Bible said the letter killth and the spirit give life. Is that right? So we totally dependent upon the Holy Spirit. That's why we look in this hour here now. We see the prophecies and things coming forth. So, we know we're soon at the look up that redemption is soon coming. That rapture is right at hand, right? &gt;&gt; We know. Let's see. And let's go to Ephesians 6. And we go to Ephesians 6. Here, Lord help me. He says in let's start at we just got three verses here. Let's start at verse 10. Ephesians 6 and 10. Finally, my brother, be strong in the Lord &gt;&gt; and in the power of his might. That's right. &gt;&gt; He said, "Put on the whole armor of God that ye may be able to to stand against the ws of the devil." That's right. &gt;&gt; He said, "For we wrestle," and this is what we really want to keep in mind because for we wrestle not against flesh and blood. That's right. &gt;&gt; Okay? But against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. May the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word. You know what we looking at here tonight? You know, we have to understand when you come into the house of the Lord, the house of the Lord, God has an order. Is that right? Remember our battle tonight. We're going to read quotes. Uh we kind of loaded tonight, pastor. I I cover for you. Okay. You didn't read no quotes Sunday, but we got some over here, right? So, can I preach like I'm out there? Look, let me preach the way God made me. Is that right? Can I walk that way? Stand in the word. Okay. Because we come against the devil. And we come against the devil. I have no respect for the devil. Is that right? I got the devil's answer because God's given it to us, right? &gt;&gt; By the seventh angel messenger. &gt;&gt; Satan. We're going to read something in a minute. Satan always fighting against the word &gt;&gt; and he's always fighting against God's prophet. He always has. He always will. Is that right? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; See, but we have to understand. He says it's going to be so close. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It will deceive the very elect &gt;&gt; if it was possible. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But it's not possible. Is that right? Ah, because our name was written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Got to hear it. We got this here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to read this one. It came out of want to look at u Hebrews 3. &gt;&gt; And I want to read this quote here because it just kept ringing in my spirit. So I said I better read it because that first verse there in in Hebrew chapter 3 and verse one Yes sir. &gt;&gt; is is real. I don't want to get a hold of myself but when I get out there you know this is the year. Is that right? &gt;&gt; It's a Bible question is a Bible answer. It went from Genesis to Revelation. Is that right? God has opened his word. &gt;&gt; Look at this quote here. It's 3:19. See, some of we come in here and we got certain situations. So, you got to understand I'm God gave me grace to get out of my amen corner, but I'll be back in my amen corner soon. Okay? Only God because the footsteps of the righteous is order of the Lord. Is that right? That's why you understand love. We got a great pastor. God sent him here. Well, you got a double portion. You got a pastor and you got a teacher. Is that right? And the prophet God said the enemy can't get into that. Is that right? So the leoty has to understand these things. Okay. So when you come into the house of the Lord, uh, you come in there with your spiritual cap on. Is that right? You got to come in so you can realize the way the enemy attacking people, attacking individuals in the flesh. No way. Not in the house of the Lord. Is that right? This is the spiritual hospital. Okay. We got his answer. So when you come in here, it's something you got your mind on and it shouldn't be on. Uhoh. &gt;&gt; Huh? He that keep his mind on Christ, I will grant him what? Perfect peace. Is that right? Huh? We're going to get somewhere in a minute. You know, I can't help. I love kicking up, beating on the devil. Is that right? I'm going tell you about See, my theme been in the institutions in the prisons. You know what it been, pastor? Salvation versus religion. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Is salvation versus religion. That's been my theme from day one. Is that right? Because we wrestle not against flesh and blood. Okay. So you got to understand the demon forces is hiding behind religion. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Huh? So you got to realize that Cain and had Abel, it started in the garden, didn't it? And when it started in the garden, Cain and Abel, Cain worshiped God. &gt;&gt; Cain believed God. &gt;&gt; Cain did the same thing. Built the altars like Abel did. But the difference was was one thing. What? He had no revelation. Is that right? Inspiration by revelation. Is that right? So we got to understand that you can have a inspiration, but if you're not in the channel with God, it's not going to produce what God has called for. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Coming in the house of the Lord. But this is the one that dropped in my spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I'll do my best, sister Edith. I'll do my best. Now I get to go down. Always remember what we're here for. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; This is 31964. &gt;&gt; Always remember what we're here for is try to increase your faith in his presence. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He says that you might receive that which you ask that you ask for it. &gt;&gt; Then by faith you believe. &gt;&gt; That's right. You see? So you got to catch the inspiration. &gt;&gt; Huh? You got to catch the inspiration at that time. Is that right? &gt;&gt; So under that inspiration, somebody can get saved. Uh somebody can get delivered. Somebody can get healed. Uh somebody can have their financial need met. Is that right? Because this is the throne of God. He that have an ear, let him hear what the spirit has to say. Is that right? Come on, saint. We're going to read something here tonight. Once you're fortified, you're fortified by the word of God. It's always positive. [Music] [Applause] Ah, that's just the way I preach when I'm out there. &gt;&gt; Huh? Shake the devil up. You know why? Because they're used to people coming to the institution. Pastor, well, you know, we're here tonight, my friend. I come here from such and such church and we're representing. Yeah. And then when you hear somebody coming in, say, [Applause] takes the devil. Huh? &gt;&gt; He said, "What kind of religion is this?" This ain't no religion. This is the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; That's what it is. [Music] &gt;&gt; He said, look, he said, he said, remember, &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He He says that every redemptive blessing &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; has already been purchased. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; He said he said the price is paid. There is only one way that you ever the only one way that you be able to receive it is to believe it and accept it. He's the high priest of our confession. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hebrew 3:1, "Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the apostle and high priest of our profession, Jesus Christ." But that one word stop me, consider. You see, don't consider nothing else that the devil tell you. Only consider what Jesus Christ has already paid for for each and every one of us. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's all we considering. Is that right? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Anyhow, &gt;&gt; he said, look, he said the Hebrew says there that the Hebrew letter says the high priest of our profession. Of course, to profess and confess is the same thing. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; He's the high priest of our confession. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Therefore, he cannot do anything on on for us until we first what? &gt;&gt; Confess it. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; My brother, &gt;&gt; we're going to get some somebody confessing tonight. We're going to get somebody delivered tonight. &gt;&gt; Somebody going to get it. Why? When understanding comes, confidence come. Confidence come, your faith come. And when your faith come, you know why? I can walk out like that. Seventh thing, brother Steve, when I go in the institutions, I walk like that seventh angel. Huh? &gt;&gt; That's just the way I walk around him. Just like this. I got no use for the devil. Is that right? Especially when you know God sent you somewhere. &gt;&gt; He'll manifest it. He'll vindicate it. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh, religious demons, help me. Let me keep going. Let me show you what he said here. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now the high priest of our confession, he cannot do anything for us until first we confess that that it has been done." &gt;&gt; He says, "And then when we confess it, then he is the high priest, &gt;&gt; a mediator to go to work on that and make it right." &gt;&gt; He says, "So we pray trusting in God." He said his kindness and his mercy that he will give to to us. Now look what we're talking. We're talking about the word fortified by inspiration. &gt;&gt; All scriptures are written by inspiration. &gt;&gt; But all scriptures you got to understand the inspiration we're going to come when the inspiration comes it comes by revelation. We'll see. Just just bear with us. By the grace of God, we come in here to take you up there to another level. Some speak words and it's just them speaking it. Is that right? But we got to remember that God gave us the best. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll read another hair quote for you. So, I don't I don't want to get ahead of myself. Most of the time when I'm out there, I'm doing a lot of preaching. Let me slow down here. We got here 53162. Look what he says here. And this is in the conflict between God and Satan. He says, "In Eden, God knew his enemy and all the attacks of his enemy." Do you know your enemy? &gt;&gt; See? Huh? &gt;&gt; See, you got to understand now. God is infinite. God, and the infinite God is the perfect of the perfections. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm talking to the fortified perfection &gt;&gt; every time. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; See who who chose you? &gt;&gt; Who brought you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; We come from God. We go back to God. &gt;&gt; He says he knew all things before they ever was. &gt;&gt; That's right. He says, "And therefore, if this infinite God could have looked forward, &gt;&gt; and he did." &gt;&gt; He said, "And seen the the end from the beginning." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; See, because he can be all places because he know all things. Is that right? &gt;&gt; He says, he he said God could have looked forward and seen it from the beginning and knew that he would have children on this earth. &gt;&gt; That's right. He knew that he was going to have children on this earth in Leoa. &gt;&gt; You belong to God. You come from God. Uh see that's how Eve, remember Eve got deceived. Satan came to her and said, "You'll be like who?" &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; But they was already God's. &gt;&gt; Satan already know who you are. You got to move into your position. &gt;&gt; He knew they was God's. Preach some of that out in now. They look at you like you're crazy. &gt;&gt; Huh? Satan identify who they was. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Let us keep going. Look what he says. &gt;&gt; I knew from the beginning he says an infinite God. He says, he knew he was going to have children on this earth. &gt;&gt; His own his own blessed children. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't you believe that he will provide for them the best that he could provide? Amen. &gt;&gt; Ah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just raise your hand since if I'm going too fast. Later on, I might take off now. Okay. He said, "Now look, he he he says, we're not we're not you tonight to your children. If they was helpless little fellas, take care of them. Don't you struggle to work, do any Don't you struggle to go to work. do everything that you can to provide the best you can. Huh? To provide for those children. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He said because you are a father, a parent. &gt;&gt; Is that right? He says and I say the truth and thought of a earthly parent and a parent originated where at God. So the first original office as a parent originated as God. So you got to get your information from God. Uh so you go to God, trust in the Lord in all thy ways. He will lead and he will guide. He will direct thy path. Acknowledge him in all thy ways. Uh our father which are in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Uh thy kingdom come. Uh thy holy ghost come. uh thy holy ghost come uh so that thy will could be done uh on earth as it is in heaven. Forgive us as we forgive our debt in us. But lead us not into what? Temptation. Oh, some of you struggling because you forgetting about forgiveness. &gt;&gt; I don't know which way I'm going. I'm depending on him. &gt;&gt; Huh? Look what he says. &gt;&gt; Lead us not into temptation. &gt;&gt; Sir, &gt;&gt; we're going to show you why some so many of them get in trouble when they go out there. We're going to show you what happened to Moses, too. We got a lot of Don't y'all get upset with your wives when she when she straighten you out. We got a lot of zaporas in here. They better thank God for them zaporas. [Applause] Huh? &gt;&gt; I'mma show you how important she was in that scripture in a minute. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Oh, stubborn men. Is that right? Huh? Tell me this ain't the pastor. I'm I'm not preaching. Huh? Get around in there. They want to do everything their way instead of God's way. Huh? Every time I ask my wife when I said someone's in my house, anyone in my family, anyone come visit. If my house wasn't right, I told him I'm the blame. How you going to put the blame on them if you in charge? God's the father. He's in charge. &gt;&gt; You can't break the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Turn it over. &gt;&gt; Huh? Look what he says. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now, &gt;&gt; and you'll know them by their fruits." Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Look at these fine children. &gt;&gt; Huh? Look at these fine children. Christian children, man. &gt;&gt; Because God, the footsteps of the righteous is ordered of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And they recognize, train up a child in the way that he should go. When he grow old, he will not depart from him. Grow him up in the admiration of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Keep up the good work, Elijah. Hallelujah. Huh? &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. &gt;&gt; He said, look, he said, God, because he was the first parent, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Don't you think that, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Seeing that Satan, &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; Satan would be what Satan would do, &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. He gave to his children &gt;&gt; and provided for them &gt;&gt; the best thing that he could be. Provide for them. &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. The best. Because you're the very best. You're the very best. I made you very good. Not just good. Very good. Don't listen to Satan. You know, when you're down there praying &gt;&gt; and you know, pastor, when the Holy Ghost allowed you to minister that little lesson, &gt;&gt; see, he got over there. Some have to realize &gt;&gt; when they committed those acts, &gt;&gt; we were sinners. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't you listen to Satan try to condemn you. He said when when when those that are in Christ Jesus, no condemnation. who those that are in Christ Jesus. We walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit. Is that right? Don't let Satan try to condemn you with that. &gt;&gt; You got to understand God is bringing his word back to the capstone. &gt;&gt; Huh? That's what it is. You got to realize &gt;&gt; it's the Holy Ghost. Is Christ back on the scene? &gt;&gt; That's those young men. Huh? I wish I to have those young men had when the Lord teaching them. Huh? What he tell them when they looking for a bride? sisters, you get one of these young men and those that's looking in, you don't have to worry about uh what kind of man you getting. He's going to be a Christian. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Because in the scriptures, what did he say? Uh he said what? They got to be what, pastor? A grown man. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; They got to be mature. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because who that? Adam was a grown man. Is that right, &gt;&gt; brother Charles? You know what I'mma do when I see Adam? I'm say, Adam, they say you the only one don't have a belly button. Let me see if you got a belly button or not, Adam. [Applause] &gt;&gt; See, don't right because God made him a grown man. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And then the second thing, a man got to have the Holy Ghost. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You got to have the Holy Ghost. And then after he got the Holy Ghost, then a man got to do what? He got to give him a what? A job. &gt;&gt; He gave him a job. Adam ran the earth. Is that right? And he gave him a job. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Eve ain't in the picture yet. &gt;&gt; Eve ain't in the picture yet. Because there's one more thing you got to get. You got to get the message of the hour. The word of God that's inspired. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Huh? You got to have it. Now you're getting ready to do what? Get you a bride. Is that right? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, sisters, you got some grace, too, don't they? Huh? &gt;&gt; Talking about courtship, didn't he? &gt;&gt; He says, "Where you, you know, the red, yellow, green light? That might mean to y'all just driving out there, red, yellow, green. That might mean just the light hanging out there." But these sisters, it mean a little more. Is that right? He said red. When you got the red, that's what courtship. Boom. Hold it. We going to Now you got your courtship. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Huh? Then you got the yellow light. The yellow light is the engagement. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; And then now they got the engagement. But certain things got to be asked in the engagement. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Certain things got to be can be asked in the engagement. If you find out something ain't right, you ain't got to get stuck with a knucklehead. Now, [Applause] &gt;&gt; you ain't got to get stuck with him. Is that right? That's a yellow light. You moving with caution. Huh? Caution. Caution. Should I go through this light or not? Huh? &gt;&gt; And then if everything is okay, you got what? Marriage. Is that right? Huh? Now you got the green light. Is that right? You can go. I don't know how we got on that. Huh? If I let something if I left something out the pastor uh he he'll cover me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Look what he's saying there. Now &gt;&gt; he said God because God and Satan he says God because he was the first parent. &gt;&gt; Don't you think that God seen what Satan would be? &gt;&gt; What Satan would do? He gave to his children and provided for them. The best thing that could be provided for them. He said to knowing knowing what the enemy's attack would be. &gt;&gt; Now remember he said our our lesson is fortified by the inspiration. Word fortified by inspiration. &gt;&gt; Look at here. See what brother Brandon said. He said God fortified his children. That's right. &gt;&gt; You are fortified by God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You got virtue coming out of you by God. &gt;&gt; Huh? You don't have to back up nothing. &gt;&gt; Huh? You don't have to fear anything of the devil. Is that right? &gt;&gt; God is fortifying you. God has chosen you. You were there in his mind before the foundation of the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; Inspiration. &gt;&gt; Look what he says. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. &gt;&gt; He said, "God knew &gt;&gt; this great war was coming on between right and wrong." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God knew it. See, everybody got spies. Okay. &gt;&gt; Everybody got spies here. Get out of this jacket. It's for you. I just &gt;&gt; I know how the devil be messing with people mind. So you got to understand between here and there, it's the devil. &gt;&gt; See, and he got the mind on the people. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Just like he said, if you know my schedule, she know it. The Lord know and the pastor know it. You ain't gaining no weight. Just keep going. Hallelujah. He said, look, &gt;&gt; he said wrong. He says he knew what the enemy was going to do. He knew just exactly how to equip his people. &gt;&gt; God know how to That's why he said, "Put on the whole armor of God &gt;&gt; so you may be able to withstand the w of a devil in his end time." Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; So we got to understand the armor of God is that is the word of God. The fortified word of God. Is that right? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And he also send us a fivefold ministry. &gt;&gt; Is that right? To dress his bride up in this hour here, saints. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What did he say? The &gt;&gt; the helmet of salvation, breastplate of righteousness. Is that right? preparation of the gospel of peace upon your feet. Girt your loin is that with strength. &gt;&gt; Let us keep going. Help us Lord. &gt;&gt; He says how to equipped his people. &gt;&gt; So if we notice the very first thing God equipped his children being infinite, he know what to He know what it took to defeat Satan. God knows what it takes to defeat Satan. Then why are you listening to the bluff? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Huh? He's already a defeated enemy. &gt;&gt; He's a bluff man. If you stand on the word of God, keep the word before me. David said, I keep the word before me at all times. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, look what he says. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, now help me, Lord. &gt;&gt; He said, equip Satan any He said he knows what to defeat Satan anytime, any place, anywhere. &gt;&gt; That's right. and any conditions. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; and any conditions. &gt;&gt; With his stripes, I'm what? &gt;&gt; I'm healed. Uh all you got to do is confess it. Confess the word. Uh speak the word. Uh then it'll move upon it. Is that right? But you got to catch the inspiration when it's under that inspiration. See, I can That's like I can't have prayer lines. I can't touch them. &gt;&gt; You see, best thing I could do is maybe bump them. Is that right? I can give them a bump, but that's all I can do. Is that right? So, you got to ask God to give you that word, anointed word, by inspiration to go out and prick their souls. Is that right? Get a man to repent. It's the gospel. I'm going to show you how powerful this gospel is. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Show you what brother Brandham said about that gospel. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Want to want to challenge God, you let you belong to God. &gt;&gt; When the devil come and challenge you, you just remember Calvary at the cross. At the cross where I first saw the light and the burdens of my heart rolled away. It was there by faith I received my sight. Is that right? Living, he loved me. Dying, he saved me. Buried, he carried my sins fall away. Rise and he justify me. Ah, let me keep going cuz I got a lot here. I got a lot. I ain't going to keep you long, but I want to cover this. God help me. &gt;&gt; Brother Sam, I know you're looking in. Don't get me if I don't cover it all. He said, now look. He said, now and and now look at the great new He said, now great new warfare. He said, but God, &gt;&gt; he says, let me help me, Lord. He says, like we we're in a military force, the old bow and arrow. He said the sledgehammer. He says, that's next. He says after the bow and arrow, he said the musket. Now you know brother Brandham's talking about how things progressed during weapons in the wars. Is that right? He says the atomic weapons and things. He said we keep growing more. Look at this here though. He said but God &gt;&gt; at the beginning &gt;&gt; gave his children gave his children the atomic weapon. &gt;&gt; He said because he's the infinite God. That's right. Now, seeing there was going to be a conflict and there was going to be a battle, God equipped his children with the right kind of ammunition, the right kind of attack. He said, "The right kind of everything, everything." He says, "Now look, that they may need that they may need that would sweep them all the way from Eden &gt;&gt; to the rapture. It's already in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's already in you. &gt;&gt; God got to bring it. We're going to show you what God does as he progresses. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because what we got body, spirit, and soul, right? You got body, spirit, and soul. And deep down inside of you, what? You got to you see, taste, feel, smell, and hear, right? Is that body? Is that right? The spiritual man. Then we got the spiritual man. This what most of you Christians get deceived at. Imagination, memory, reasoning, conscience, and affection. Is that right? That's what got Eve. Reasoning, intellect. Is that right? Huh? You ought to see them out there, too. Them religious demon. I'm telling you, there see hiding. I had one fell sit at a table the other day. Pastor was at his study. You know what? He turned around. I mean, he quote scriptures. Running quote scripture. Sitting around in there. I've been looking at this fell. He's shutting them up. He was shutting them up. They wouldn't say nothing. &gt;&gt; And that fell, I ain't say nothing to him. I said, "Lord, this is the first time he's seen him." But what is he doing? He just had a good memory. &gt;&gt; God said, "Don't say nothing. Just watch him and listen." &gt;&gt; I We'll be back. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But see, the fella didn't want to accept his me. Let me tell this testimony here. Fella didn't want to accept his message. We were sitting at the table. I'm just letting him have his way. Fella didn't want this testimony. We were sitting at the table and we were sitting there at the table and we got around in there and he got over there and the guy sat there and he said he was talking about Elijah. And we were talking about Elijah. So he said, "Uh, Brother Glenn, how about the next week you you you talk about Elijah." I said, "Oh Lord, this is the Lord here, right?" So I know denominations don't don't ain't going to like this, right? So we were sitting there with all the denomination guy. So I said, "Elijah got to come five times." This is the following week, short version of it. Here's the guy over there. This the following week. And the following week when I came back, I said, "You had Elijah, you had Elysia, you had John the You had John the Baptist." And I said, um, Elijah got to come back back in Revelations over in Revelations 11. So he got around, he kept talking. One of the fellow, you kind of the wisdom come from God. It don't come from man. &gt;&gt; So you got around there and and wait. So when we got over there at the Leo dea, we got around. He said, wait a minute. You said it was five. I said, "Here we go." He got around in there. Brother Steve, I I had I had that picture in my Bible, right? I had that picture right in my Bible. So when we got around there, I says, "Will you marry and Brandham?" Fer said, "Who?" I said, "William Marian Brandom." He says, "Uh, Fer says, William Mary," he says, "I never heard of him." I said, "Uh, I looked to the president. I said, "Is it all right if I pass this picture around?" He said, "Yeah." He says, "Go ahead." And I passed the picture around and one of the fellas sitting at the table said, "I heard of him before." &gt;&gt; We ain't finished with their testimonies yet. Now, you got to remember when you're in those institutions like that, they do a lot of digging. They do a lot of studying. They go Hebrew. They do a lot of Greek. But that's why we say tonight, inspiration by revelation. They got a bunch of information, but it's not revelation. &gt;&gt; You got to have them there. &gt;&gt; I took my paper. Pastor, can I use your board? &gt;&gt; Ah, let me let me show you. Let me show you. Simple to us, powerful to them, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I got over that. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; All right, man. &gt;&gt; Okay. That's okay. &gt;&gt; Good. Perfect. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. I said I got to ask you a question. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I said I got to ask you a question. &gt;&gt; I said the seventh messenger, right? &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I said, "What's the number seven?" &gt;&gt; How many letters in each one of them name? &gt;&gt; I said, "What's perfection?" He said, "Three." I said, "How many names are there?" [Applause] Is that right? &gt;&gt; Separate them. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Oh, forgive me out there in in land. I forgot to grab my mic. Huh? Simple to us, &gt;&gt; huh? However, for it's it's powerful because it shook their minds. Now they got to thinking. &gt;&gt; Okay. Because when I go minister to him about the messenger of the hour, I said, "Well, you got to go look at Malachi 4, Luke 17:30, Revelations 10:7, Revelations 22." I said, "Go dig." See, they going to dig in the scriptures, right? But there no revelation. Is that right? Because a man got to be born again. That's why you got to understand when a man is out there being born again. See, they're not going to even receive it until you're born again. Is that right? &gt;&gt; So, you got to understand, unless you born again, uh, it's just an intellect. It's just a mind thing to him. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Let me keep going. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Look what God says. We're talking We talking about inspiration. The word of God by inspiration. He says he gave that will take us from Eden to the rapture. What is it? &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; It's the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's what defeats Satan. &gt;&gt; He said it's the word. It'll defeat him anywhere, any place. He says, "Now why do we want to substitute something else when we already got the best thing that there is the word?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look what he says. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "And we see Jesus on earth just to prove this was the best equipment when Satan came to Jesus." Is that right? We know. What did Jesus say? It is what? &gt;&gt; Written. It is what? Written. It is what? Written. Because why? He was God manifested in the flesh. Is that right? So being God manifested in the flesh. Uh Satan didn't know he was coming up against God. Uh then Jesus finally asked me, he said, "You come to try to attempt tempt the Lord thy God." Huh? Jesus knew who he was. Is that right? You got to know who you are now. When the devil come at you with something that's not of God, you got to know who you are. Shoot it down, saints. Shoot it back at him. Is that right? Speak the word by faith. Huh? Huh? &gt;&gt; Let me keep going. The Lord help me. Look what we got here. Hallelujah. He said Jesus, he came to him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; He said, "It is written." Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; And he punched him right out of the ring. &gt;&gt; Jesus did not play with the devil. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's like a man say the other day. That's why I say you were sinners, brother. We were used to when God brought us back. &gt;&gt; Huh? I thought about he said that punch when brother Brandham when he was a prize fighter. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Huh? When he's a prize fighter at 15 on professional fights. Is that right? He said when the guy came on him, he said when the guy came came at him and said, "Bill, you look like a Baptist preacher." What did he say? He said, "I was about to jump all over him." He said he better say that with a smile. Is that right? Huh? You going to tell me he was saved then? No. He was a sinner. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; Look what he says. Help me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He said, "Now it takes us there." He said, "It's written." He said, he punched him right out of the ring with it. That's right. Because it's God's best. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; He said, "You see, it's God's best. You got You're God's best. You got the word inside of you." &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "And look where it is. It's not just for one or two in the church. It's for every one of us." Amen. &gt;&gt; Every one of us. &gt;&gt; Every believer. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; You don't come in here and let Satan mess with your mind. Huh? Well, we were talking about the other day, Benjamin. Cast down what? Every imagination that tried to exalt itself against the word of God. Is that right? Destroy it. Is that right? Shoot it back at him. He said, "We wrestle not against what? Flesh and blood. The weapons of our warfare are not what? carninal. He did not tell he he did not tell the Corinthians what the weapons was. Is that right? He did not tell them, but he told Ephesians church what the weapons was. Is that right? Because they were more mature. You're getting more because you're more mature. You're his bride. God know you can handle it. His word does not go out void. &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said, "And look where look where it is." He says, "Every believer has a right to take to take this word and fight the enemy &gt;&gt; anywhere you meet him." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He says, "Anywhere you meet the enemy, he said this word is what you have to use." And Jesus proves proved that when he come, he he equipped his children with the word, &gt;&gt; their protection against the enemy. Children, you understand what your protection is against the enemy? &gt;&gt; The word. &gt;&gt; It's the word. &gt;&gt; Just speak the word. Keep the word. David said, I hid the word in thy heart so I may not sin against thee. &gt;&gt; Look what he says. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says when he says and when all out warfare comes and the battle set in the ray and there is only one thing a real soldier can use a real Christian soldier that's thus say the Lord he said walk right out there and meet the enemy with the assurance that what nothing &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; thousand fall at the right at the left he said but won't come thee just Remember that God made this statement and give this to his children and it's the best that it's the best that's ever been yet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says Satan in Eden when he first come to these attacks to attack a person knowing the children of God was fortified with this word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; See, Satan attacks the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; He attacks the word. &gt;&gt; He says he never attacked the being. He attacked the word first. &gt;&gt; You see he slow he swed a seed of what? Of discrepancy. He says so Satan tried to attack the word in the garden. So he had to have something now that he could use the human beings. And now remember what did he use? He used reasoning. &gt;&gt; He tried to come with reasoning. Now you got to be careful because you got individuals. If you're getting a word and the word of God is telling you not to do something, then what someone come along and says, uh, well, you know, it's no harm in doing that. Uh, God didn't just mean that.Uh, come on. You know, uh, you know, our church does this. Uh, our church does that. We go to these things here, you know. Oh, that's just your church. Uh, what is he trying to get you to do? Is reason. Is that right? Oh, we know. You'll be just like God. Eve, is that right? You'll know the things that God would know. Huh? Eve stopped and listened. Is that right? She should have never stopped and listened to it. He should have shot her right back at him. Is that right? Thus say the Lord. God said, "Touch not the tree of knowledge of good and evil." Is that right? That's what he said. God meant what he said. That's your protection. That's what your fortress is. That's your your fortified. You're fortified by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Now look, I'mma jump here some. Help me, Lord. You got to understand that in this hour here now, we're talking about the word being fortified. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; By inspiration. &gt;&gt; It was certain ones that caught the word &gt;&gt; by inspiration. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If you catch the word by inspiration, then that's God speaking to your soul. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. Now once you catch the word by inspiration, you're moved by inspiration. Is that right? And now once you go there and if is inspired by God, uh God will manifest it. Uh it will happen. Is that right? It's because you're moving by the inspiration of God. Is that right? The Matthew 16:16, he said, Peter, who do them say that I am? Uh, some say you're Elijah. Some say you're John the Baptist. Some say you're Jeremiah. Peter, who did I say that I am? Uh, some say you're one of the prophets. But Peter, by inspiration, I'll read a quote to you in a minute cuz I know you message theologians. You I got to show you that. And I got to show you that in the quote there because you look at it the letter. If you take that letter, is that right? He go around there. He say inspiration. Is that right? He said what? Uh Peter said Peter answered and said what? He caught the inspiration of God. Is that right? He said he said Peter he said thou art the what? The Christ the son of the living God. Uh he says uh Peter flesh and blood this was not revealed to unto you. This only could have been revealed to you by my father. He said, "Peter, which upon this rock, uh, I'll build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it." Peter caught the inspiration. All right. Revelation. He caught a hold of it and said, "What is the building?" He built the revelation is what? Upon the revelation of the word who Jesus Christ is. Is that right? And Jesus agreed that Peter Revelation was right. Come on now. We got the inspiration. Remember the widow woman there in Kings. Remember Elijah? She didn't have a child. Uh and she didn't have a child. Uh when she got over there, she said her husal to her husband and asked her husband if she would but this is a man of God. Uh with this get this man of God. this man of God. Uh, could we give him a place to stay there when he come by and he can rest? Uh, then he said, "You know what? Ask him and see if we can do what? Even if we could put a bed back there, honey, we could put a bed for him. Then we could come and he can rest." Uh, so that Judomite woman there, right? She knew that Elijah was coming by. Is that right? So Elijah did what? By inspiration, he wanted to bless the lady. Someone told Elijah that she didn't have a child. Is that right? So Elijah know a woman without a child is a reproach. Is that right? But you know God said in this hour here you should not be born or unfruitful. Right? Manifest confess your child. Uh testify your child. Uh get that baby room ready. Start painting that room. Uh got paint that room. Is that right? Buy the clothes that you want for them. Is that right? confessing, speaking. When you catch the inspiration, that baby's coming. It's coming. When you catch the inspiration of that child, uh, I'm bringing you a word and showing you what's happening. Is that right? He got to be under the inspiration. So, we got there and then the baby, right? He was out there plowing, working with his daddy. And he was out there working with his daddy and then he died. Is that right? And when the baby cut maybe a heat stroke or something, but when he got there and he died, is that right? And he got over there, but under the inspiration. Is that right? She wasn't even there, brother. She wasn't even He wasn't even there. Elijah wasn't even there. She caught the inspiration, took the baby, picked him up, uh laid him on Elijah's bed. Is that right? Is that right? Is that right? And when she laid him on the bed of Elijah, then when Elijah came, is that right? She knew all I had to get him to is the message of the hour. If I can get him to the message of the hour because it's a double portion. It's an anointing on that word. Uh it's the second oil that God bring back to him. It's an anointing like it's never been before. Whatever you need, you can ask for. Just confess the word. Uh [Applause] Look what she said. Uh when Elijah came uh once he came there and he said that pastor uh you know the baby was around there dead. Uh but not only was he anointed everything that he touched was anointed. We know. Is that right? Because God said I am commissioned to bless you. Is that right? I'm commanded to bless you. Is that right? So we got to understand this. When he got over there, he laid on that baby and breathed on that baby seven times. Is that right? And when he breathed on that baby, the baby came back alive. Is that right? But she caught it by the what? Inspiration. Is that right? We were talking about there with Moses. Is that right? Not Moses, I mean Joel. Is that right? Joel caught the inspiration. When Joel caught the inspiration, it was a dark time. Is that right? He said, "What? The palmer worm, the canker worm, the caterpillar, the locust was eaten up. Is that right? He caught the inspiration way back up in the ages. Is that right? Joel saw it. Is that right? But God then later on came and did what? Broke it through the seventh messenger. Is that right? When he came with the seven messenger, he said what? He said what? The pomme worm, the cankerworm, the caterpillar, the locust have eaten up. He said I what shall restore. Is that right? I shall restore what the Catholic Church have eaten up. What the Baptist? What the Methodist? What the Lutheran? I shall restore the word back. Is that right? Why? Uh because I gave you my atomic bomb. Uh I gave you the best thing that I can. Uh I gave you myself. Is that right? The anointing is on the inspiration. The inspiration comes uh when it comes at the right season. That's why he was saying it got to be a what? Time. It's a season and a purpose. It's a time. It's a season. It's a purpose. It's now down the season to get what you need to get, saints. This is the season. God wouldn't unfold it. It's time to grab it. Call what you need, saints. Uh don't back up now. Uh come through that door. Get your mind set. Uh don't get weary. It's Wednesday night. Uh God brought you here. God's going to grant you what you come expecting. Speak the word. Uh, confess it, saints. Uh, don't give up now. Fight the good fight of faith. I press to the mark of the pride of the high calling. Is that right? Let's look at Huh. Let's look at Zapora. I'm going to show you this Zapora. He called it what brother Brandham said about it. Let's go to Exodus 4. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. It's the season, pastor. It's the season. &gt;&gt; Keep on reading. Keep on doing what you're doing. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's going to get sweeter and sweeter. &gt;&gt; I'm going to show you what that scripture when he said when the enemy come in like a flood. &gt;&gt; Huh? When That's right. He raised the spirit of the Lord raises up a standard. We going to show you what the standard is in a minute. &gt;&gt; That's why he's giving what he's giving you, pastor. We got to have somebody that he's going to use in this end time to fulfill his scripture. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Look where he at. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. What I say? Exodus 4. We call out Exodus 4. Help me, Lord. Look what he says. Don't let the devil come in here talking about no war. Huh? I'm a warrior from my youth. Huh? &gt;&gt; What are you talking about? We've been trained for this. Is that right? You grew up on the concrete jungle and you got your concrete jungle and it's 10 of y'alls and and daddy struggle coming from the Korean War. Huh? and daddy struggled from the Korean War. And he got two older brothers that got theirel in the jail. Huh? And I'm now I'm the oldest and I got seven behind me. Huh? &gt;&gt; God trains his people. You don't know what people have went through. &gt;&gt; You do not know. Uh-huh. Huh? God just don't put his people there. Was not David out there in the wilderness with that lion and that bear? Huh? You don't know. Each and every one of you got your testimony. God trained you for what you went through. God saw you what you going through. God brought you through what you went through. That's why he did. Huh? You think Sister Lorel just cooked like the way she cooked? God brought her that. God trained her. God brought her here for us for his bride. &gt;&gt; I'm getting to Exodus. I know just where I'm at. I'm enjoying myself. Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I'm among family. You're my family. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] Look what he says for the sake of time. Exodus 4. Let's look at verse uh let let's look at verse 18. You ready? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He says, "And Moses went and return to Jethro, his father-in-law." He says, "And said unto him, let me go pray thee return to my brethren there in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive." And Jethro said to Moses, "Go in peace." And the Lord said unto unto Moses and Midian, "Go return in Egypt, for all the men are dead which sought thy life." He says, "And Moses took his wife and his son and set them upon an ass." He says, "And he returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the rod of the rod of who?" &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; The rod of who? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; If they could have got that rod out of his hand. &gt;&gt; Ah. Ah, God h in simplicity and revealed the same. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Look what he says. &gt;&gt; He turned around and help me Lord. He said in his hand. He said, "Now I tell you this here." See, because the hand is the power of God. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me keep going. Help me, Lord. He Thank you, brother. He says, "And the Lord said unto Moses, when thou knowest to return unto Egypt, see that thou do all these wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thy thy hand, but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let what?" &gt;&gt; Let the people go, and thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, "Thus sayeth the Lord, Israel is my son, even my firstborn. And I say unto thee, let my what? son, go and he may serve me. And if thou refuse to let go, behold, I will slay thy what? Son, he says, and even thy firstborn. He says, and it came to pass by the way in the end that the Lord met him and sought to do what? &gt;&gt; Uhoh, here comes Sapora. Here she come. Then Sapora took a what? sharp stone and cut off the foreskin of her son and cast it at his feet and said surely a what &gt;&gt; the husband art thou now what &gt;&gt; now you're ready to go forth you covered with the bloody gospel is that right now you can go forward is that right because it was a covenant brother Brandham said he said the covenant was you had to have circumcision he said a circumcision today is what the Holy Ghost Is that right? He said Moses got so caught up in his work. Uh Moses got so caught up in his intellect. Moses got so caught up in his religion. Moses wasn't taking care of God's work first. Is that right? He had to understand everything's by the blood. Uh Moses forgot that they had to have the blood on the doorpost and the ltho. Is that right? Before they came out of Egypt, it was part of the covenant. The blood. Is that right? They were getting about what? Preaching the Holy Ghost. Is that right? Uhoh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; God meant a man got to be born again. &gt;&gt; You take that covenant. &gt;&gt; It's the bloody work. The covenant. He gave it to Abraham. Abraham had to have a covenant. You see, it had to be the gospel. We're going to show you in a minute. He showed the signs in the wonders. Put your hand in your bosom, Moses. Put your hand out of the bosom, Moses. Put your hand back, Moses. You got to have a clean and pure a pure heart and a clean hand. Right, Moses? To handle my word. Anybody can't handle my word, Moses. And then when he told him to go back, he says, "What?" He says, "Now, Moses, I'm showing you this gospel, this power in this gospel." If you go over to Genesis 12, Abram, Abram, he had to see the gospel, too. I'm getting somewhere in a minute. I'm going to show you what Brother Brandham said about it. It always was and it always will be the lead of man unto salvation. Now you're ready to go in and pull a man out. Bear with me. Huh? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look what he said. Help me, Lord. He said, now look. Thank you, Jesus. He says, "And it came to pass by the way in the end." He says, "And Lord met him and sought to kill him." And Zenapor, he said, verse 26, "So he let him go. Then she said, a bloody husband thou art because of the what? circumcision &gt;&gt; of the circumcision. Remember that was a covenant, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It was a covenant that he had to keep. &gt;&gt; But he was going down to Egypt to deliver him, but he hadn't kept all the word yet. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You see, and brother and brother Brandham said it was his intellect and he got caught up in those things. You can go back and look at the quote. The pastor pull it up for you. I'm jumping a little bit. Help me, Lord. He said, "Now look, I want you to see something here. the the the uh uh inspiration. Turn to uh God help me. Yeah. Turn to uh Matthew 16. I want to read it to you. Matthew 16. I want to help me Lord. He said now Matthew 16 is in here ye him. He in here hear ye him. And just look at the verse 13. You'll see what I was saying about there with u um Peter. He said look now. He said some of these things uh 93056. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; We got paragraph 18. I'mma jump around now. So y'all write it down if you can't keep up. Oh sometimes the cost of a a price to really say sometime it causes separation from whom? Sometime it cause separation from churches. Sometime it cause separation from lodges in all walks of life. Sometimes between husband and wife to really speak out. He said, "But I I like Peter." He's made a lot of mistakes. I have He said, "But this one time, he was really inspired." &gt;&gt; He said, "Yes." He stood up quickly and said, "Thou art Christ, the son of the living God." He said, "What a statement. Thou art the Christ, the son of the living God." Who was the Christ? Uh he was the son of God and he was the Messiah. He was the son of God and he was God in the flesh. Is that right? Let us keep going. is that's help me Lord. He said blessed yes blessed art thou Simon Barjonah for flesh and blood has not what revealed this to on you. He said but upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of hell to prevail against it. He said there he said there you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said inspiration &gt;&gt; inspired the revelation. &gt;&gt; He says oh how he was inspired. He says, "Standing there in front of the Messiah &gt;&gt; on Sundays when you come in there, you're standing there in the presence of God." When you're standing there in the presence of God, uh, you think it's just a man. Some go out and say, "My pastor." Some go out and say, "Brother Stephen." Some, but what do they say? Do they say the Lord? Let me tell you what the Lord told us today. Is that right? Let me tell you what the Holy Ghost has told us today. No man can interpret those things. It takes the Holy Ghost. Is that right? How can you tie a thing with a with a season? With a season, right? How can you tie a a thing with a season? Things is tied in with a season that's hidden that scripture for years. It was hidden in there. &gt;&gt; Come on, man. It's God. He's letting you know you in his presence &gt;&gt; under the inspiration. You can get what you come expecting. &gt;&gt; You coming in just believe it's just church. But then I h forgive me sister Eden. When we come around in there, &gt;&gt; let me slow down a little bit. &gt;&gt; You come in the house of the Lord. You got to understand about get me stirred up. I ain't even I'm just a third of the way finished. Let me keep going. I told you he missed the quote Sunday. I got him. He said, "Now look." He said, "Look," he said, "It's the Messiah, thou the Christ." He said, "Flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you." Look what he said. He said, "What is it?" &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; It's upon inspiration. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see it upon inspiration of the Lord Jesus Christ through his word. &gt;&gt; That's right. He said, he says, "I will build my church and the gates of hell will not prevail against it." Look at this here now. He says, "Though it shows all the gates of hell will be against it, but they cannot prevail. &gt;&gt; No matter what's coming against us, you just keep saying all is well. &gt;&gt; All is well &gt;&gt; is working for our good. All is well. All is well because we know the beginning to the end. All is well. He said God said, look at his hair. He said God said when the enemy comes in like a what? &gt;&gt; I will do what? Raise up a standard against it. What he say, brother Kha? He's the spirit. Look, he says, God says, I will raise up a standing against it, God will do it. &gt;&gt; He said, look, and when all the gates, when all the gates torment is pressing against that little church, he said, yet it will never prevail against us. It's not going to prevail against us. It's only pushing us to our purpose. It's only pushing us to what God put us here for. Is that right? You got a reason, you got a season, you got your time, and you got your purpose. Is that right? So, he's pushing us to our purpose. We cannot leave here for our purpose. That's why I say, young ministers, what God put in you, you got to do it. Just do it. Is that right? Don't try to imitate anyone else. If you imitate somebody else, then you're not you're not letting God supply to his people what he needs. I got the quote here. I don't know if we have a time. I'll read it to you so you just what the prophet said. Okay, look what he says here. Hallelujah. He says he'll raise up a what? &gt;&gt; A standard against it. He said just he says I think the disciples in the early days when there were just a little handful of people, he said with no education, no ability, he said no degree, they had no determination behind them. They had nothing but one thing. and that was the Holy Spirit. They had received the day of Pentecost. They didn't need more for God had already said upon this inspiration, I will build my church. Uh that's what he's telling them. Look, what is that? When the enemy come in like a flood, remember God said his word, he's alpha and omega, the beginning and the end and the first and the last. When the enemy came in, at every age, you still with me? Every age. When he came in, he raised up a standard. He raised a standard by his word. Uh when he got Paul, is that right? After Paul came, then he had Iranius. Then after Ianius came, then he got Columbus. Then after Columbus came, he got Martin. Then after Martin came, he had Luther. Then after Luther came, he had Wesley. Then at the Wesley came, he had the Pentecostal. Then after the past, the restoration of the gift of the Holy Ghost. Now he's got the what? He's got the bride. He always raises a standard against it. God does not refortify anything. God just raise another standard. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; First seal. First seal. riding. He come on a white horse. First seal riding on a white horse down there. Oh, look, man. Did you see that? You see that, man? He got a bow and no arrow. He got a bow and no arrow. Brother, tell everybody superficial revelation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. got right around in there. He said he got now it comes out of the thundersh come out of there. What was it? Is that right? &gt;&gt; He came down there now. It was the antichrist &gt;&gt; and it revealed that the antichrist. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Oh, they caught it. Now we're bringing it up to our day in the message. Is that right? We came in the house of the Lord together. We took sweet counsel together. Luther came. Is that right? When they came in Luther, is that right? It was a dark time. But Luther, he came, he pulled away from the Catholic Church. And he said, "The just shall live by what? Faith." Is that right? It was almost dead. It was almost gone. Is that right? Then he had to come with Wesley. But when he came in, what? When he came in Wesley, I mean when he came in Lutheran's time, he showed the bride. She never did it. Is that right? She never did. Is she not guilty? Is that right? Then it came around in Wesley's time. Then it came in what? Pentecostal time. Is that right? Pentecostal at the restoration of the gift. When the restorations of the gifts came. Is that right? Then what happened? Let me tell you something, saints. You don't have to be afraid. If you got a gift, God given us a word to examine if it's true or if it's false. Get yourself out of the way and let God use you. Is that right? Let him use you the way he put you here to do it. God will vindicate it. Because Jesus said at the well, is that right? When he came at the well, Jesus came and he told him, I mean, not at the well, forgive me. When he came there, met John the Baptist. And he met John the Baptist down there. And John the Baptist came to Jesus. He said, "Behold the lamb of God come to take away the sin of the world." Is that right? Brother Brandham said when he met them and he says, "I need to be baptized of you. I don't need you to be baptized of me." He said, Jesus said, "All righteousness must be fulfilled." Is that right? He said, "Every promise in that Bible will be fulfilled in this age." Is that right? like it or not, the gifts were sent to keep the church clean. Is that right? That's God's order. The Holy Ghost leads and guides us into all truth. Uh we're talking about inspiration by revelation. First time uh that a man God had ever put foot on this earth again. Is that right? The prophet of God met God at the river. Is that right? John the Baptist introduced him. Is that right? So we come and we talking about superficial revelation. Is that right? So you had to have the second oil. Is that right? When he came and he brought them the second oil and that oil that was there and he said they took they had no oil in their vessels. Is that right? And in their lamps. Is that right? He typed that thing in his age here now. They're not having the Holy Ghost. Is that right? They needed the Holy Ghost in his age here now. We're talking about the hidden things. We're talking about inspiration of God. Is that right? We're talking about Joshua, Joshua 3, Joshua 4. Remember, they was going over Jordan. Is that right? Once they was going over Jordan, that's why you got this interpretation. That's why you got that interpretation. God didn't tell Joshua to take two sets of stones. He said one sets of stone. Is that right? Joshua took another set of stones. When Joshua took the other sets of stones, Joshua knew that it was going to be some foolishness. Uh, and so Joshua put those stones in the middle of Jordan. Is that right? So he got there in the middle of Jordan. That's right. And when the river came up, is that right? The right interpretation, the right revelation had to come when the seventh angel came. And that interpretation came, it was the middle of Jordan. Is that right? You had to die out to yourself. Uh, you got to get away from your thinking. You got a man sitting on the stone on the outside. Come on now. Now, but it was on the outside. Uh, the stones that was on the outside, uh, Baptist can change it. Methodists can change it. Lutheran can change it. Message people can change it. They can change it. Is that right? But, uh, you had to come. Why? Get a double portion in the second coming. What? Elisha. Elisha said what? They say we following a man. Is that right? They were the ones that's following the man. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; No, he's going to leave. Don't you, Charlie? He's going to leave, don't you? Elijah's getting ready there. I know it. Hold your peace. I know what I'm watching. He's going around in there. He said, I'm going with you. And I know what I'm watching. Elijah going to go there. Oh, don't you know Elijah's going? I know. I know. Hold your peace there. I'm not watching Elijah. I'm watching the spirit on Elijah. because I want a double portion when he leave. He said, "If you see me, all you're going to do is ask what you see me." Is that right? They had to cross over Jordan. Is that right? But the sons of the prophets, [Music] but the sons of the prophets, when they turned around in there, they got around and they don't know what's this. They don't know if this quote match this. They don't know if this quote go with this. They don't know if this scripture go with this quote. They don't know if this scripture go with that quote. Just say what the prophet said and God will inspire it. &gt;&gt; But you gotta believe. You gotta believe. You got to believe that that is the covenant messenger. You got to believe. He You got to believe over there. And we're at uh uh Revelations over in Revelations in the breach. Is that right? When you go over to Revelations in the breach, when you got there, when all of them was at the throne, first in Revelations 4, the four beasts was the what? It was the gospels. Is that right? Then the four beasts, they went over there. Now, when the preacher, they came down, the four beasts, and all them was around the throne, the 12 and 12, the 24 patriot, the 24 apostles. Is that right? And brother Brandham said the four beasts was the gospel. Is that right? He said that's what it was there. Hold it. Hallelujah. Some of you looking at me. I know you follow me. Hallelujah. Look what he says. Help me, Lord. He said, look. He said, now look. He said be. He said, now here's the four beasts of Revelation. This is 10657. 10657. He said, now the four beasts of Revelation. He said every place in in the Bible, the four beasts that the four faces, he said one face was like a man, the other face was like a ox, the other face was like an eagle, the other face was like a lion, and they never went backwards. They couldn't go backwards. They always went forward. That's the gospel. Let's keep going. He says now he says they look not go backwards but every way they went they were going forwards. He says if they went this way if they were going like a man it went this way it was going like a lion. If it went that way it was going like an eagle. If it went this way it was going like an ox. See they couldn't go backwards. They were going forward. Each time uh God every time the enemy come in like a flood, he raises his standard in the word. Uh he breaks the word. Uh that's what they don't like. Uh the revelation of the word. Uh let us keep going. &gt;&gt; We ain't finished with you. We going to get back to that Jordan. I know just where I'm at. He said now those four beasts now too quickly this cuz I don't want to say I don't want to stay too long. He said the beast represents power. He said see and notice these beasts were not were not out yonder in the lake or in the sea somewhere. He said but at the throne of God. Is that right? They were at the throne of God. Uh now we're getting ready. He just passed what? The Patmas vision. Is that right? when he came into Revelations 1. If you go into Revelations 1 to go in the Patmas vision, that's all you got to do is go out there and catch a sinner. You want to catch a sinner? Brother Brandham broke down all that down there in the Patmas vision. He talked about the the the the baptism. He talked about being born again. Is that right? Right in the Patmas vision. That's how you can win a sinner. Is that right? Luke 19:10 said the son of man came to seek those that was lost. Is that right? When you get them in there, take them religious demons in there, twist their minds up. They can't even catch a hold of what you're talking about. Uh, but I'm that Patmas vision. John was there. What? On the island of what? Patmas for the what? For the word of God and testimony and the testimony. The testimony because Jesus Christ backed them. He stood for him. What he was doing, he was vindicated him that the word is right. Saints, uh, move forward. Each day you get up, look for somebody to save. Take this gospel to bring the gospel to them. I'm growing you now. [Music] &gt;&gt; Still back 10657 paragraph. 686. He said, "Now look," he said, "Now those four beasts," he said it represents power. You notice the beasts were not a yonder in a lake or the sea somewhere. He said coming up. He said they were at the throne of God and they were worshiping God. &gt;&gt; Let it sink in worshiping God. Oh my God. Get if you can give me just five minutes. 10 minutes. 10 minutes. Okay. Hallelujah. I'm going have to jump. He said now he said the beast he he says to God help me Lord. The four those four beasts means four powers. He says that come up out of the earth. He says in those four powers, where's the four gospels? Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. He says, and that is He says in the gospel, he said he says in the gospel goes forth as a what? As a lion. Still with me? It's stern. It's stern. And it's bold. He says the gospel is brave like a lion. He said you don't have to fear nothing, man. You look that devil right in his face. Uh when the doctor tell you there's no more he can do, he say, "Doc, uh I appreciate you, but you know what? I'll bring the testimony back to you. I know a God. I know a God that calms the river. I know a God that calms the storm. I know a God that's Jehovah Rafi. I know a God that can move mountains. I know a God. We got to move this hair." Uh you got to understand, uh it's time, pastor. Now it's time. Uh this is the dispensational time. You got to understand uh when that man remember I said it's the gospel the power is in the gospel. Brother Brandham said when he was in that meeting in Oregon and then that meeting there he said when that man came and honked up and spit in his face brother and then he turned around and what did he say? He said those preachers in there when he came up to there he said those preachers was there in the front. Uh soon as that man come they got scared. Is that right? Supposed to be the man of God and started scattered. Is that right? He said the man came up in there and he said when the man came there under the inspiration he got over that he said this day you're going to fall across my feet. &gt;&gt; The man said brother Brandham said that was not him that was God. &gt;&gt; He he said the man came up and challenged God. &gt;&gt; He said he was they asked him was he dead? Uh he says he know. Uh he said what did that to him? Brother Brandham said it was the gospel that's what knocked him down on his feet. Come on saints. Uh you got to understand uh you bring him through them seals. Uh you can see the gospel in the seals. Uh you can see the gospels in the church ages. You can see the gospel in Patma's vision. You can see gospel in the breach. Uh the gospel is there. Is that right? He coming around in there. He says speak to this mountain. Brother Brandham had to move into his position and he said speak into this mountain. He said he looked at that scripture. He was a wise man. He never touched the scripture unless he had the revelation of it. Inspiration. He says the fortify by the is the word fortified by the inspiration by the revelation of the word. Still with me? He said then after he came around and he said the good he he he he was out there under that sycamore tree and he said he got up under the sycamore tree. And he said he was wondering about that scripture. I think it was Mark 11:23. Is it is what you say? He said whatever you say. He said always wondering about that scripture. Now he was talking about. Now you see why I pulled back Greg the other day Friday night when he pulled back over there brother Albert is because he was going this is what the Lord had showed me. And then brother Brandham had to realize that it was going to be a a change. Is that right? The change was coming because when he sat up under that sycamore tree, he did not recognize that voice. &gt;&gt; Go back and look at it. &gt;&gt; And after he get around there, they did not recognize it. Then after he came, why is because God was moving him into that scripture. &gt;&gt; He never knew the revelation of that scripture. And now once he had God's servant had to move into that area first you got to move into your position justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and the adoption. The adoption places you now the Holy Ghost inside of you. God can move you in your position seasoning time and purpose. Is that right? He come back around in there. Now after he sat there up under that sycamore tree and that voice spoke to him and when that voice we about to close bear with me pray with me. He said he got around there in there was under that sycamore tree and he asked him again uh I'm telling you about moving into the spoken word now &gt;&gt; the revelation came to him when he was in up under that sycamore tree. They was going hunting. And it was a voice he did not even recognize at that particular time. &gt;&gt; And now he came because you know he had done talked to God numerous times before that. But this particular time here he was moving them into that scripture. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; And he got over there. He was asking at that scripture the the that scripture the wrong way. He says in that scripture, he says, "What you say?" &gt;&gt; He said, "Then you need some squirrels." &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Now he needed some squirrels. Aren't you in a position out here that you need something? &gt;&gt; Don't you need something? See now when the inspiration come down he says you got to understand now when you need something &gt;&gt; and the inspiration is there &gt;&gt; don't miss it that's your opportunity &gt;&gt; sir &gt;&gt; I say now sometime he teach Then sometime he talk like a father &gt;&gt; and then sometime he just start preaching like an evangelist. &gt;&gt; The presence is there. &gt;&gt; You got to be come through the door. Don't come through the door talking. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; A nose bleed. Get out of here Satan. &gt;&gt; Boo devil. Buddhist, [Applause] &gt;&gt; you're the children of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You're the spoken word of God. &gt;&gt; God chose you for this time. You're overcomers. [Applause] spoken word, &gt;&gt; but he had to see it in the scriptures. God hid it from him until it was time. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. [Music] That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We went in there. &gt;&gt; That voice said again, &gt;&gt; but you got to understand. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He said on the scripture then he started trying. He tried the spirit. Where you wanted that? I wanted to run down that hill. Here come the squirrel. I wanted on that limb of that tree or that oak tree. Here come the squirrel. Dispensation time was changing for brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; But he had to see it in the scriptures. &gt;&gt; What you say if you if you say to this mountain and doubt not in your heart. &gt;&gt; He said man. He said then the voice said again. &gt;&gt; Didn't you say three? [Applause] &gt;&gt; He was moving to something. It's got to be specific and you got to know. And remember after he got the three, the devil came and said, "There's many more squirrels out here. He never moved." See, see what we moving into. You're going to be tried and tested. You got to understand what's being preached. You got to realize it's time for us. I ain't even got over there into the Patma's vision and showed you we going to be held responsible. Simple things about just tear tear down, root up, build out. We got to bring the bring this gospel to those that's bound up in the system. Not the people. There's good people. This the system that's binding them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There's people in there in in in these lives out there in these runchy lives out here. Then remember he went and now before he could go to Hattie Wright, he had to experience it himself. And then remember they went to Hadtie's Wright's house. And under the inspiration, &gt;&gt; that's right, brother. He said, pastor, he said what? You said the right thing. I'm not going to the story. Y'all know the story for the sake of time. We're talking about this gospel. We're talking about tear down, build up, root up, root up, tear down, build down. You know, one of the toughest things, the the toughest things for me to deal with out there, father, son, holy ghost, &gt;&gt; them titles. Well, you talk about people turn to stone face when you telling the man that got to be rebaptized. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; If he don't catch it under inspiration, he gonna sit right there. He's not going to move &gt;&gt; under his inspiration. &gt;&gt; You got to realize what the Lord is doing. I'll stop. I'll stop because there's more testimonies. Let me say this here. So you I bring it up to what testifying under the ministry what I'm sitting under the souls God is bringing in. You'll see him come judgment one day. &gt;&gt; Amen. cuz those souls that that we go through. But I got to go in there straight and hard against those religious demons. We just had about 12 of them in a meeting. I was in an institution pastor. Got there and we had everything blocked off. I didn't know I was going to be able to get in the classroom. But we got in. They was locked down. Everybody was locked down. Locked down. And when they were locked down in there, they said, "Uh," I said, "Well, Sarge, can they go to Bible study?" She said, "Yeah, okay." So, like the runner on there, he went and found out how many wanted to come. 12. We got over there at 12, you know, and she let him out mercifully. So, we was in the slider and you know their conversation, they be saying choice words. they get around in there. So I looked at him and I just stood there and this the sergeant. I said, "Man, they not even respecting authority." So we got over there, we stood in there, you got to walk down the hall, they talking, whatever, going down the hall, going down there, we go in the classroom. I said, "Come on in. Sign your name right here." I waited for the sergeant to go. I'm waiting for the sergeant to go. I said, "Let me tell you something. You conduct yourself like men. Your situation has nothing to do that condition. Your condition has nothing to do with the promise of God. &gt;&gt; I said, "You understand that?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Suppose that was your mother. Suppose that was your sister. &gt;&gt; I said, "You know why she in there working? Because of your lazy men." &gt;&gt; And they looked at me like, "Where'd he come from? That's exactly what it was. We got in there. We had our study. It was 12. Had a lesson always working with most of the time born again. Trying to get them born again. We had over there. I said, "How many heads bowed, eyes closed, how many want to turn their life over to the Lord? Five hands went up &gt;&gt; and the five went up went and turned their life over to the Lord. They got over there called a sergeant. It's time for them to come. Now remember, they were locked down. They wasn't supposed to come. When they went out in the hall, it was like this. Sage turned around. She said, 'What days you say you come here?' She said, 'I need to put them on lockdown every day you come because you should have seen them. They conducted theirelves like men. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When I start telling them pastor about a man courting and that was thus say the Lord you gave them young men about being a man. Brother Brandham said 90% of the men locked up as over or by a unsaved woman. &gt;&gt; He said n, this is 1957. He said 93% of the people in America don't go to church. You see how much opportunity we have? Every day I get up, Lord, send someone across my path. I could tell them about the goodness of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there's testimonies. And that's what I'm And it's more and more. But for the sake of time, we won't wear you out. We didn't even get we didn't even touch tip of what I want you to see. But it's a lot what the Lord has showed the prophet of God about the inspiration. People missing the inspiration, missing their opportunity, missing their healing, missing their deliverance. He said, "What you say?" We need a 100,000. 100,000 is coming. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What you say &gt;&gt; you need healing confession healing &gt;&gt; is what you say. &gt;&gt; You need deliverance call deliverance. Come on musicians is what you say. &gt;&gt; You need salvation, claim yourself. Take your salvation. It's what you say. &gt;&gt; You want your child to come in. &gt;&gt; It's what you say. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's what you say. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, I thank you pastor. I thank you for the opportunity. He knows sometime he he's like a son, but he know I respect him as a pastor. &gt;&gt; And there's times when he say no, this is just the grace of God. &gt;&gt; So you don't know. Y'all pray for me tonight &gt;&gt; because I God knows but it was burning on me. &gt;&gt; But I knew but I knew it was time &gt;&gt; because what the go what the Lord has been giving them. &gt;&gt; And it's so all those things are so simple but it's mighty to those that's bind up out there.
