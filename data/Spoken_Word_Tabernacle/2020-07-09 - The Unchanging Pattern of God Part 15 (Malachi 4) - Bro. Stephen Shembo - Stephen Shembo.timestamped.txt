[4:29] help us everybody this evening um tell
[4:34] you what Wednesday's are quite a bit
[4:35] different than uh in Sundays I feel like
[4:37] we're back to virtual services I
[4:41] definitely enjoy enjoyable full church
[4:44] but um we know some people are on the
[4:47] streaming and we still have some people
[4:49] here with us this evening so we're happy
[4:51] to be here I'll share a quick testimony
[4:54] um I was on my way to pick up my wife I
[4:57] work in Charlotte she works in Stanley
[4:58] and on Wednesdays I drop her off in the
[5:01] morning and I pick her up so we can ride
[5:02] the gara to church and it's pretty tight
[5:04] it's a it's a tight squeeze to get here
[5:07] on time but uh I was on my way to the
[5:10] house to pick her up and I felt my car
[5:13] was acting up I didn't know what was
[5:14] going on but I was like a bear just hold
[5:15] fast because I pull over and something's
[5:17] wrong I'm gonna have to I'm like it
[5:19] stuck so let me just hold fast and
[5:21] normally I'd pull over and look but I
[5:23] was like let me just get to the house so
[5:24] so I get to the house and I
[5:27] check my tires and one of them is flat
[5:29] and I'm like oh lord I knew that if it
[5:33] caused if I had to jack my top car up
[5:36] and replace the tire and put a spare on
[5:38] it might have made it a squeeze to get
[5:41] here on time and uh so I called called
[5:45] our boss my wife babysits for them and
[5:47] asked if he had a patch kit and he did
[5:48] so I was able to get a plug in it and
[5:50] get it pumped up and and get here on
[5:52] time so I was thankful for that that was
[5:54] God just keeping his eye on us and
[5:56] keeping us under his hand of protection
[5:59] and helping things to work out well so
[6:02] I'm thankful for that but we'll just
[6:04] start the service with a word of Prayer
[6:06] and as always I invite each one to pray
[6:09] with me
[6:10] and we'll just pray together and just
[6:12] open the service and we know God has
[6:14] something store for us today because
[6:16] whether two or three are gathered you
[6:18] know in his name he'll be in their midst
[6:20] and you know we we have more than two
[6:22] here tonight so I know he's in our Miss
[6:24] tonight and I'm expecting great things
[6:25] so let's just bow our heads and pray
[6:28] Lord we love you and thank you we
[6:31] appreciate each opportunity we have to
[6:33] gather one another together Lord just to
[6:36] to worship You Lord and to learn around
[6:39] your word Lord and and to receive a
[6:41] greater revelation of your word so we
[6:43] just ask at this time Lord that you just
[6:45] take everything and put it under your
[6:47] control Lord just may each person get
[6:50] themselves out of the way Lord and
[6:51] prepare themselves for the word Lord may
[6:53] we get the things of the cares of the
[6:56] world and put them aside Lord our jobs
[6:58] or or our families or family matters or
[7:01] house home matters or financial matters
[7:03] or whatever it may be Lord may we just
[7:05] put those things aside so we can focus
[7:06] on you this evening and we can hear
[7:08] something from you Lord Lord we know
[7:10] what this this virtual service and and
[7:13] different things Lord and and the Cova
[7:15] and everything that's going on Lord we
[7:17] know it's hard to to kind of get in the
[7:20] atmosphere of worship Lord but we're
[7:22] just going to push against the enemy
[7:23] you're guarding that we're gonna still
[7:25] enter in Lord to a to worship and praise
[7:27] Lord to you because you deserve it Lord
[7:29] no matter what goes on you still remain
[7:31] the same Lord you're the same yesterday
[7:33] today and forever so we just ask that
[7:35] you move us aside Lord move the minister
[7:37] aside move each and every one aside that
[7:40] we can receive something from you Lord
[7:41] we we don't want to just become head
[7:43] knowledge Lord but we want to pass past
[7:46] our head and drop down to our heart Lord
[7:48] we want to be a revelation or because if
[7:49] it's a revelation no man could take it
[7:52] from us Lord so we just ask that you
[7:53] just come down Lord speak to us once

[15:53] [Music]
[16:23] before we do when I was a younger kid
[16:26] and I used to listen this song I used to
[16:27] say well I am a Christian I am a
[16:29] Christian but then when I learned what
[16:31] the word Christian means it means to be
[16:32] christ-like I realized that the song is
[16:34] saying Lord I want to be christ-like in
[16:36] my life and I know that even though we
[16:38] are Christians we could always be more
[16:40] christ-like and and I now it has a whole

[20:34] if here on our strength or anything that
[20:36] we can do we fail we know if we chose
[20:39] God then we would we would fail you know
[20:42] if we wouldn't if it was us holding on
[20:45] to him we would we would lose our grip I
[20:48] know I would do things that I've been
[20:50] through in my life I know that that I
[20:53] would I would lose my grip but it's God
[20:55] holding onto us and his strength is
[20:56] perfect he said he wouldn't lose the one
[20:58] of his and I know I'm one of his I know

[23:46] [Music]
[23:48] Jesus
[23:51] oh
[23:53] [Music]
[24:03] [Music]
[24:29] don't waste your tonight
[24:32] good to be back in the house of the Lord
[24:34] as brother David is working on these
[24:37] let's go to Isaiah chapter 40
[24:43] we dealt with the three sons in brother
[24:46] branham's ministry we put those three
[24:50] signs under the first the second and the
[24:52] third pole was the highest octave
[24:57] because Paul in the book of Corinthians
[24:59] say that let me show you a more
[25:01] excellent way he gave the gift of the
[25:04] Spirit than before chapter 13 he say an
[25:07] excellent way not a way a little bit
[25:10] more higher the top so we want to go
[25:13] through the top once we are connected
[25:15] with the top then automatically the gift
[25:18] takes place everybody clear Isaiah 40
[25:23] chapter 3
[25:25] if you dare you can say Amen but David
[25:29] you want this to be here okay no problem
[25:32] give me a minute let's switch this
[25:36] slowly so everybody can get it
[25:43] hopefully that'll be clear can everybody
[25:47] see this good or you or me sweep it up
[25:50] everybody good okay praise the Lord okay
[25:55] Isaiah 40 verse 3 the voice of him the
[26:00] choirs in the wilderness you might be
[26:03] seated
[26:06] so now you know more horrible you know
[26:10] the triples you know the cloud you know
[26:13] all of that by the scripture this is one
[26:17] of the major problem Pentecostal and
[26:19] some people in a message here we're
[26:22] going to be dealing with John the
[26:23] Baptist because in Malachi 4 we got John
[26:28] the Baptist over there and usually it's
[26:30] easily confused between Boojum the
[26:33] Baptist and brother Branham so we want
[26:36] to take John the Baptist and clear him
[26:38] up completely so when we come with
[26:40] brother Branham it's gonna be easier
[26:42] everybody clear ok the voice of him that
[26:48] cries in the wilderness so that voice we
[26:51] know it's not speaking about just a
[26:54] voice it's a person there's a person
[26:57] that is going to be crying in the
[26:59] wilderness prepare
[27:00] you the way of the Lord so this person
[27:04] or this voice
[27:06] this person which is refer as a voice
[27:09] his mission is to prepare
[27:14] the way of
[27:16] the
[27:18] Lord
[27:20] it's a Ministry of preparation
[27:24] prepare you the way of the Lord make
[27:28] straight in the desert a highway for our
[27:33] God everybody clear let's go to Malachi
[27:37] chapter 3
[27:38] we're dealing mainly with John the
[27:42] Baptist I wish the whole church was
[27:45] there and I hope they're going to be
[27:47] watching this after because it's very
[27:50] important for young people
[27:53] yeah very important denomination this is
[27:59] where they got a trouble with the
[28:01] ministry of brother Branham
[28:03] Malachi 3 if you dare you can say Amen
[28:07] the Bible say be Lord I will send my
[28:11] messenger in Isaiah 40 he was the voice
[28:15] which was referred to a person in
[28:18] Malachi 3 that person is referred to as
[28:23] a messenger how do you know brother
[28:26] Steven that this messenger of Malachi 3
[28:30] is the same person as as they are 40
[28:35] remember the one in Isaiah 40 had to
[28:39] prepare the way of the Lord everybody
[28:43] clear you need your Bible you say I will
[28:46] send my messenger and he shall do what
[28:50] prepare what the way you can see the
[28:53] same thing here so this one also have a
[28:57] mission to prepare the way the way of
[29:01] who the way of the Lord that's the
[29:05] reason why this person of Isaiah 40 is
[29:08] the same person as a Malachi 3 you will
[29:13] wreak on us or you detect them by the
[29:16] ministry or their characteristic are you
[29:20] there in Isaiah 40 he is called a voice
[29:23] but in Malachi 3 he is called a
[29:26] messenger remember don't be caught up by
[29:29] the name don't be caught up by the form
[29:32] remember to look at the characteristic
[29:35] or the works or the ministry the same
[29:38] person is preparing the way of the Lord
[29:42] he said he shall prepare the way before
[29:45] me and their Lord so the way is for the
[29:50] Lord so the most important things is the
[29:55] Lord
[29:56] who is the Lord
[30:00] the Lord whom you seek so somebody will
[30:05] be seeking this load and
[30:08] the scripture say seek and you shall
[30:12] find
[30:13] so if somebody is gonna seek him
[30:16] somebody must find him are we there
[30:20] clear so the Lord whom you seek
[30:23] we know that the Jews and the Samaritan
[30:26] were waiting for the Messiah so right
[30:29] here this scripture is telling you that
[30:32] he belongs to the Jews and he belongs to
[30:35] the Samaritan so this should be the
[30:38] first coming of the Lord because Gentile
[30:42] we are outside of the Commonwealth of
[30:44] Israel we didn't know no God are you
[30:48] there but the Jewish who are waiting for
[30:50] the Messiah based on what Moses told
[30:52] them according to the trona meet up to a
[30:55] team that the Lord your God will send
[30:57] you a prophet like unto me and Samaritan
[31:01] being in connection with the Jews also
[31:04] we're waiting if you go to John chapter
[31:06] 4 you're going to remember the woman at
[31:08] the world also was waiting for the
[31:10] Messiah so the Jews and the Messiah and
[31:12] the Samaritan were the ones seeking for
[31:15] the Messiah so the Lord whom you seek
[31:19] shall suddenly come this is something
[31:23] that I want you to keep shall suddenly
[31:26] come
[31:28] so the coming of the Lord is something
[31:33] that is sudden it is quick and
[31:37] then when he comes it's quick
[31:42] they were all together in the upper room
[31:45] and suddenly
[31:47] you see that okay the Lord whom you seek
[31:52] shall suddenly come to his temple
[31:58] so the interest of the Lord in the
[32:02] temple is going to be suddenly it's
[32:06] going to be quick so
[32:09] who is this Lord and who is this temple
[32:13] that the Lord will get into it everybody
[32:17] dear
[32:18] even the messenger of the Covenant so
[32:23] this Lord is also referred as the
[32:27] messenger of the
[32:29] Covenant so
[32:31] we know that the message of the Covenant
[32:38] was nothing else but the pillar of fire
[32:44] are you there that follow the children
[32:47] of Israel I have quotes on these
[32:50] so this Lord this messenger when he
[32:55] entered in the temple is going to be
[32:58] sudden
[32:59] but before he enter into the temple
[33:02] there is somebody
[33:04] preparing this in other word the
[33:09] prophecy of this man is coupled or
[33:14] connected or hooked with the event that
[33:20] the Lord
[33:21] getting into his temple
[33:24] suddenly this man is not only
[33:28] responsible to prepare the way for the
[33:31] Lord but this man his ministry is
[33:35] connected to the entrance of the Lord in
[33:38] his temple suddenly
[33:41] everybody clear
[33:43] even the messenger of the Covenant whom
[33:47] you delight in behold he shall come so
[33:52] we're talking about the coming of the
[33:54] Lord behold he shall come say the Lord
[33:57] of hosts let's go to John chapter 1
[34:01] verse
[34:02] 40 and then we will be praying
[34:11] strongly encourage if you may support go
[34:15] back and look it up we are building one
[34:19] step at a time
[34:22] John chapter 1 verse 40
[34:25] everybody there one of the two which
[34:29] heard John speak and followed him water
[34:33] Robert is going to be nine and nine give
[34:37] me signal yes sir thank you one of the
[34:41] two which heard John speak
[34:44] followed him was Andrew simon Peters
[34:47] brother
[34:48] he first found his own brother Simon and
[34:52] say to him we have what found
[34:57] is it clear the Lord whom he said
[35:02] write sick Anusha
[35:07] so we have found somebody was sitting
[35:11] him we have found the Messiah
[35:16] that's the Lord which is being
[35:19] interpreted the crust and
[35:22] he brought him to Jesus and when Jesus
[35:26] beheld him he said you are Simon the son
[35:30] of Jonah you shall be called Cephas
[35:32] which is interpreted as stone the day
[35:37] following Jesus would go forth into
[35:39] Galilee and find Philip and say to him
[35:43] follow me now Philip was of Bethsaida
[35:46] the city of Andrew and Peter
[35:49] Philip finds Nathaniel and said to him
[35:53] we have
[35:54] found everybody clear twice again we
[35:58] have found the Lord whom you seek now
[36:02] it's now they are seeking but they are
[36:04] funding the Lord we have found him of
[36:07] whom
[36:09] Moses in the law the tirana me chapter
[36:13] 18 and
[36:15] profit not only did Moses was the one
[36:19] that prophesied by the prophet remember
[36:22] in Luke chapter 24 when Jesus met the
[36:25] disciple on the road to make Myles the
[36:27] Bible say he started by Moses and
[36:31] prophet are we clear who Moses and the
[36:35] Prophet did write who is that person
[36:39] Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph
[36:42] was his name in the Old Testament no but
[36:47] because they were seeking the Lord seek
[36:50] and you shall find
[36:51] everybody clear now let's pray
[36:55] Heavenly Father
[36:57] we thank you again for your grace your
[37:00] love and your mercy father you have
[37:02] given us another opportunity to gather

[37:44] night Lord whether here or on the
[37:47] streamline Lord Father I pray that's the
[37:50] anointing of the holy spirit come to

[39:13] night Lord father as we commit
[39:15] everything unto the hand in the name of
[39:17] Jesus Christ amen
[39:19] god bless you once again we are
[39:23] continuing with the unchanging pattern
[39:26] of God Malachi for now we are dealing
[39:30] with the person of John the Baptist
[39:31] before we drop into brother Branham if
[39:34] we go straight with brother Branham
[39:36] we're not going to be able to see
[39:39] exactly what's going on when we deal
[39:42] with John the Baptist
[39:44] John the Baptist is
[39:46] completely connected to the first coming
[39:49] of the Lord Jesus Christ and brother
[39:52] Branham say in the discernment of the
[39:54] Spirit I gave this quote before I'm just
[39:57] going to give it now to kind of refresh
[39:59] our memory that if you if we will notice
[40:03] the motives and objective of the Old
[40:07] Testament prophet there man had one
[40:11] objective and that was Jesus Christ amen
[40:16] and they had one thing that the whole
[40:19] team of the Old Testament walls build
[40:23] around the coming Messiah that why when
[40:26] Jesus met the disciple in the road to
[40:29] Emmaus he could point to them starting
[40:32] for Moses all the way through all the
[40:34] Prophet that all of them spoke about the
[40:37] first coming of Jesus Christ they did
[40:40] not go out and do things just for money
[40:43] or for fame in other word their motive
[40:46] was not for fame for popularity or he
[40:50] was not to make money the gospel is not
[40:54] a money scheme the gospel is not a
[40:57] platform to build their popularity the
[41:00] gospel is to point the people to Jesus
[41:03] Christ
[41:04] they had one thing they were anointed
[41:08] with the Spirit of God so if we think we
[41:11] are not dead with the spirit God we must
[41:13] be doing the same thing that I did and
[41:15] they predicted the coming Messiah and
[41:19] those men were so anointed with the
[41:21] spirit until day sometime acted like the
[41:25] spirit that was within them they spoke
[41:29] seemingly of themselves watch how the
[41:32] Spirit of God made them man out in other
[41:36] word they were so in tune with the
[41:38] spirit until when David begin to say my
[41:41] God my God why has thou forsaken me if
[41:44] you look at their that you think David
[41:47] is speaking about himself but David was
[41:49] so inclined with the anointing of God
[41:52] until he begin to act like the Lord
[41:55] Jesus Christ and if we have the Holy
[41:57] Spirit and we are so connected with our
[42:00] husband that's what we will be acting
[42:02] just like our husband first chapter
[42:05] paragraph 68 he say now we notice that
[42:09] all those prophet and all they say about
[42:12] him everything come to true because he
[42:16] was the theme of the Old Testament Jesus
[42:19] the Messiah coming Messiah was what
[42:23] every prophet looked from Adam that's
[42:26] why he started for Moses because Moses
[42:29] have the father first book of the Bible
[42:32] so Adam also Moses in other word Genesis
[42:35] in Moses Exodus in Moses Leviticus in
[42:39] Moses numbers in Moses Deuteronomy in
[42:42] Moses that's why brother Branham say
[42:44] Adam if you read the scripture didn't
[42:47] say Adam they say Moses Adam was in
[42:50] Moses because Moses was the one that
[42:52] clam higher and so Adam from Adam to
[42:56] Malachi
[42:57] every prophet spoke of the coming of the
[43:00] Lord each one put his pardon because he
[43:04] was anointed of God that is all he could
[43:07] speak of nothing else but Jesus Christ
[43:11] everybody clear now if you recall when
[43:14] we establish the platform between Moses
[43:17] and Elijah Moses and Elijah Moses and
[43:21] Elijah and we in that pardon going back
[43:24] and forth because we are dealing with
[43:26] the unchanging God God does not change
[43:29] so at the end of every dispensation
[43:33] there is always a resurrection and
[43:37] coming of the Lord a resurrection and a
[43:40] rapture so when the Old Testament
[43:43] started he started in a Garden of Eden
[43:45] but at the end of the dispensation of
[43:48] the law Jesus Christ came as a baby
[43:50] through the virgin and then after Jesus
[43:54] died he rose again there was a
[43:56] resurrection of the Old Testament sin
[43:58] and there was also a rupture that took
[44:01] place so at the end of the dispensation
[44:03] there is always a coming of the Lord a
[44:07] resurrection and a rupture so the first
[44:10] coming had its resurrection and it's
[44:13] rapture and the second coming also at
[44:16] the end of the dispensation of the grace
[44:20] which is the Gentile dispensation we
[44:23] found out that there going to be another
[44:25] resurrection and they're also going to
[44:27] be another rapture which we call the
[44:30] second coming of the Lord and when the
[44:33] Spirit of God goes back to the Jewish
[44:35] people there will be another coming of
[44:37] Jesus Christ or in the first coming he
[44:40] came to redeem his brother in the second
[44:43] coming he came to take his blood and on
[44:46] the third coming he's coming on a white
[44:48] horse rather with his broad but still a
[44:52] dark coming also there is a resurrection
[44:55] and there is also a rupture of Moses and
[44:59] Elijah and
[45:01] 144,000 everybody clear so now when we
[45:04] establish this we found out that Jesus
[45:07] Christ started with Moses all the way to
[45:10] the Prophet and then unto himself now
[45:14] let's take Matthew chapter 11 verse 10
[45:21] Matthew chapter 11 verse 10 we are
[45:25] loading the scripture just like a
[45:27] vaccine we don't want anybody to have a
[45:30] problem in this church again with the
[45:32] Ministry of brother Branham
[45:34] Matthew chapter 11 verse 10 if you dare
[45:38] you can say a man
[45:39] where is the Lord for this is he of whom
[45:43] it is written
[45:45] behold I send my messenger before your
[45:49] face which shall prepare your way before
[45:52] you is referring to as eya 40 that was
[45:57] our scripture everybody clear this voice
[46:00] here right okay and verse 11 verily I
[46:05] say unto you among them that are born of
[46:08] women there has not risen a greater
[46:11] than John the Baptist I will come back
[46:15] to the scripture notwithstanding he that
[46:18] is least in the kingdom of heaven is
[46:21] greater than he
[46:23] are you there when Jesus look at John he
[46:27] said among all that are born of a woman
[46:30] nobody is greater than him and John was
[46:34] the messenger to the first coming of
[46:36] Jesus Christ now but the least in the
[46:39] kingdom is greater than John what about
[46:42] the second John died have to come for
[46:45] the second coming
[46:47] everybody clear verse 12 and from the
[46:50] days of John the Baptist until now the
[46:54] Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and
[46:57] the violent take it by force
[47:01] for all the profit this is where I'm
[47:05] going to quench it Moses also included
[47:07] for all the prophets and the law Moses
[47:12] write
[47:13] prophesied until John
[47:16] so now Jesus is giving us the beginning
[47:21] of the law all the way to the end of the
[47:24] law because when Jesus Christ died at
[47:27] the cross the law the Levitical
[47:30] priesthood was completely destroyed
[47:33] mother are you there if you study the
[47:37] Old Testament you found out that he was
[47:39] not accepted for the high priest to tear
[47:43] his clothes down you know that was a
[47:46] high priest his clothes he is completely
[47:50] disqualified so the Levitical priesthood
[47:53] was running all the way to Caiaphas but
[47:57] when they brought Jesus Christ to
[47:59] Caiaphas and
[48:01] Caiaphas asked Jesus class he said we
[48:04] heard so many people talk about you we
[48:07] want to hear from yourself who do you
[48:09] say you are and when Jesus was declared
[48:12] to Caiaphas who he was Caiaphas could
[48:15] not contain himself by prophesy by the
[48:18] anointing of God Caiaphas took his
[48:21] clothes and rent them completely he was
[48:24] assemble showing that the Levitical
[48:27] priesthood was completely disqualified
[48:29] and the Melchizedek Priesthood was now
[48:33] introduced that's why brother Branham
[48:36] saying when Jesus Christ was crucified
[48:38] the Levitical priesthood died completely
[48:41] so Jesus now is telling us that the
[48:45] Levitical priesthood started with the
[48:48] law by Moses but it ended some way and
[48:52] the one that put a stop to the
[48:55] priesthood is John the Baptist everybody
[48:59] clear so far he said that for all the
[49:02] profit and the law prophesied until John
[49:06] and if you will receive it so this is
[49:10] not for everybody if somebody rejected
[49:13] you or no problem are there if you will
[49:18] receive it this is a larger which was to
[49:23] come everybody clear so now Jesus not
[49:27] only is he referring to John as the stop
[49:31] or the last step of the Old Testament
[49:33] but Jesus Christ is calling John Elijah
[49:36] so now we have Moses at the beginning of
[49:40] the dispensation of the law but the law
[49:43] ended with our new larger this Elijah
[49:47] here was our reference so we know how
[49:52] the spirit of Elijah operate and under
[49:55] this reference when you have been
[49:57] studying we found out that Elijah
[49:59] interact with the Jews and he also
[50:02] interacted with the Jetta by John the
[50:05] Baptist was a Jew but yet he was the one
[50:09] that completes or that closed the door
[50:12] to the Old Testament dispensation
[50:15] everybody clear so far praise the Lord
[50:17] then when we drop down to the church
[50:20] edges we found out that brother Branham
[50:23] explained to us that Paul was our modern
[50:26] Moses our there then when we went back
[50:29] to our type over there we found out that
[50:33] there was an interaction of Elijah with
[50:36] the Gentile through the crow and through
[50:39] the woman Sarepta the widow woman
[50:42] showing that the spirit of Elijah will
[50:44] also go to the gentle and through the
[50:47] sills we found out that that spirit
[50:50] anointed Elijah to go to the Gentile
[50:54] when the widow was already under the
[50:56] anointing of death which was the pale
[50:59] horse rather which was showing that
[51:01] Elijah going to the genta will be Elijah
[51:04] in the last edge of the jente which is
[51:08] the age of loud ISA where the pale horse
[51:10] rather is riding on the land are you
[51:13] there so we have another Elijah over
[51:16] there but Elijah is not a Jew that
[51:19] Elijah is a Gentile everybody clear then
[51:23] we find down there that there is Moses
[51:26] and Elijah Moses and Elijah again and
[51:28] back and forth we have Moses and Elijah
[51:31] going to the Jewish people everybody
[51:33] clear so far praise the Lord now if you
[51:36] notice you find that Moses was a Jew we
[51:39] explained that Elijah himself a Jew with
[51:42] splendor John the Baptist a Jew we
[51:46] explained that Paul a Jew we explained
[51:49] that there the to Moses and Elijah over
[51:53] there are Jews and when they coming over
[51:56] there after before if then we go over
[51:59] there the one handling here is the
[52:01] gentle but we want to deal first with
[52:04] John the Baptist but the pattern I want
[52:06] you to understand here is the beginning
[52:09] of a dispensation start with Moses and
[52:13] he ends with Elijah start with Moses and
[52:18] that with John the Baptist then the
[52:21] Messiah is coming then there is a
[52:24] resurrection and there is a rupture and
[52:27] this year started with Paul our modern
[52:31] Moses but at the end there is a Gentile
[52:34] Elijah after that Elijah there is an
[52:37] introduction of the Messiah and then
[52:40] there is a resurrection and a rupture
[52:43] and then when we go back to the Jewish
[52:45] people we found again Moses and Elijah
[52:48] and at their end there is also a coming
[52:51] of the Lord and there is a resurrection
[52:53] and our rapture this is where we explain
[52:57] to you that the name of Billy power has
[53:00] something going on Billy which was
[53:02] talking about brother Branham and Paul
[53:05] which was talking about the Apostle Paul
[53:07] and that name was not given by brother
[53:10] Branham he was the angel of the Lord
[53:12] that taught brother Branham call your
[53:14] son Billy Paul brother Branham say Billy
[53:17] from his name Billy but don't be caught
[53:20] up with the name don't be caught up with
[53:22] the form and Paul he was Moses and
[53:26] Elijah hooked together and if you notice
[53:30] you found out that the name of brother
[53:32] Branham came first
[53:35] are you there the name of when you go
[53:38] with Billy Paul you find out that
[53:41] brother Branham said this Paul was
[53:44] referring to the Apostle Paul which we
[53:47] know Apostle Paul on our dispensation
[53:50] was our Moses and brother Branham said
[53:54] Billy was referring to himself
[53:57] are you there which was speaking about
[54:00] the spirit of a larger but when the
[54:03] angel of the Lord gave the name he put
[54:06] brother Branham first and he put Paul
[54:09] last but when their fulfillment of that
[54:13] happened in a normal life we found out
[54:17] that the one that came first was Moses
[54:21] and the one that came last was brother
[54:23] branham
[54:25] why is that
[54:28] you can look at your scripture in the
[54:30] book of Genesis when tomorrow
[54:35] you clear when Tamar got pregnant it
[54:39] with Judah
[54:41] everybody clear do you know that story
[54:45] Tamar got pregnant with Judah and Tamar
[54:50] have twins are you there and when when
[54:54] it was the time that Tamar have to give
[54:57] birth the first one him push his hand up
[55:02] are you then coming out from the womb
[55:06] and when he was coming out from the womb
[55:09] the wise woman that was there put a
[55:14] scarlet thread upon the hand knowing
[55:19] that this is the firstborn but for some
[55:22] reason instead of the firstborn to come
[55:25] out here we treat his hand back again
[55:28] and the younger one came out are you
[55:32] there and brother branham say the reason
[55:34] why that happened is because this first
[55:37] one had the right to intention he
[55:41] doesn't come out first he only claim his
[55:44] right and he goes back up again then he
[55:48] led the second one coming then he is
[55:50] going to come up later so that's why the
[55:52] angel recognized that the one connected
[55:55] with redemption in the end time by the
[55:58] opening of the seals is brother Branham
[56:01] so his lamb must be first but when he
[56:04] comes to birth Paul must come first then
[56:07] at the end time they wonder have this
[56:09] collar trade brother Branham will be
[56:12] coming later and bringing redemption
[56:15] further driver everybody here
[56:19] for his the Lord now we started for
[56:22] Moses ending up by Elijah Moses Elijah
[56:27] Moses Elijah because God does not change
[56:32] clear now let's dig with John the
[56:36] Baptist
[56:37] his name is John the Baptist let's go on
[56:41] John chapter one
[56:49] you
[56:53] if you dare you can say man
[56:58] on chapter one verse 19 and
[57:02] this is the record of John
[57:05] when the Jews sent priests and Levites
[57:09] for we get into this I'm going to ask
[57:12] you a question Jesus Christ told us that
[57:16] John the Baptist was who
[57:18] Elijah who say that let every word of a
[57:23] man be a lie but only God's Word is the
[57:27] truth
[57:29] does Jesus like
[57:31] everything that comes from the mouth of
[57:33] Jesus is true so John the Baptist is
[57:36] Elijah everybody here I want to you to
[57:40] get that pretty good now let's go back
[57:43] to the scripture and this is the record
[57:46] of John when the Jews sent priests and
[57:48] Levites
[57:51] to ask him who are you it doesn't mean
[57:55] they didn't know his name they knew his
[57:58] father and everything they just asking
[58:00] him who are you according to the
[58:03] scripture I and he confessed and deny
[58:08] not
[58:10] but confess I am NOT the Christ in other
[58:13] words when they approached him they
[58:15] thought he was the Messiah because they
[58:18] were sitting the Messiah so every time
[58:20] they see a move going on the elect are
[58:24] watching they're like hey what is going
[58:26] on is this the Messiah or not are you
[58:30] there and John tell them no no no no no
[58:32] I am NOT the Messiah the brother branham
[58:35] say he's not the Messiah
[58:37] yes
[58:40] let's drop down and
[58:42] they asked him what then are you
[58:48] Elijah
[58:51] direct question and he said I am
[58:55] my brother John the Baptist or the lie
[59:00] we need to close the Bible and throw the
[59:04] Bible away how many times did I ask a
[59:07] brother branham are you a prophet and he
[59:10] say I am NOT ah
[59:15] if you reject brother branham you need
[59:19] to reject the Bible I
[59:22] did the spirit of Elijah when he came on
[59:26] Elijah when they asked him by the people
[59:29] who are you he say I am NOT Elijah it
[59:33] was Jesus dubs indicated him that you
[59:37] are Elijah the Prophet
[59:40] John said no brother anima your prophet
[59:43] no
[59:47] you see now and
[59:49] he say I'm not are you the Prophet the
[59:53] Messiah insisting again and he answered
[59:57] no
[59:58] how many believe Amos was a prophet how
[1:00:02] many believe that the Prophet Amos he
[1:00:05] was a true prophet rod random say Amos
[1:00:08] was a true prophet you believe that now
[1:00:11] keep your fingers here take Emma's
[1:00:14] chapter 7
[1:00:18] we are clearing the smoke
[1:00:23] we are clearing the smoke
[1:00:27] Amos chapter 7
[1:00:31] are you there so young people when they
[1:00:35] come they say hey brother Branham say he
[1:00:37] was not a prophet himself
[1:00:39] just take this Bible you say hey John
[1:00:42] the Baptist say he was not Elijah and
[1:00:44] Jesus called him Elijah what are we
[1:00:46] going to do to this
[1:00:50] are you there let's go to mmo's chapter
[1:00:54] 7 verse 14 are you there brother Branham
[1:00:57] say Amos was a true prophet and we all
[1:01:00] know that the word of the Lord came to
[1:01:02] ammos because the Lord the word of the
[1:01:05] Lord always comes to the Prophet I
[1:01:08] am also who are you verse 14 everybody
[1:01:12] there then answered who Amos and
[1:01:18] say to Amasya I was no
[1:01:22] how can a prophet say he is not a
[1:01:25] prophet you
[1:01:29] see now I
[1:01:31] was no prophet neither was i as prophet
[1:01:36] son
[1:01:37] but I was a herdsmen and a gatherer of
[1:01:42] Sycamore fruit and was a true prophet of
[1:01:46] God telling the people that he is not a
[1:01:49] prophet and when brother Branham say I
[1:01:52] am NOT a prophet you got a problem with
[1:01:54] that
[1:01:57] you see now let's go back to John
[1:02:00] chapter 1 that's a vaccine
[1:02:06] John chapter 1 verse
[1:02:08] 21 where we were if you dare you can say
[1:02:11] man and they asked him what then are you
[1:02:15] Elijah and he say I'm not are you the
[1:02:18] Prophet and he answered no
[1:02:20] then say dead to him who are you are you
[1:02:25] there that we may give an answer to them
[1:02:28] that send us what say you of your self
[1:02:31] now John is going to be answering
[1:02:35] everybody clear now back to the
[1:02:38] scripture as they are 40 he said he said
[1:02:42] I am the voice so this person this voice
[1:02:48] is John the Baptist I
[1:02:51] am the voice of one crying in the
[1:02:54] wilderness make straight the way of the
[1:02:57] Lord say the prophet Isaiah everybody
[1:03:01] clear and
[1:03:03] then which were said where of the
[1:03:06] Pharisee and they asked him and said to
[1:03:09] him why baptize you then if you be not
[1:03:12] Christ nor Elijah
[1:03:14] needed a prophet
[1:03:18] do you see who was asking him they of
[1:03:23] what the Pharisee
[1:03:26] denomination
[1:03:28] he planted them to Isaiah 40 so by the
[1:03:32] scripture today you see that Isaiah 40
[1:03:35] verse 3 is John the Baptist we clear on
[1:03:40] that all right let's take Matthew 11
[1:03:44] verse 7 where we where again
[1:03:51] but now we want to start from verse 7 we
[1:03:55] started from 10 now we're gonna start a
[1:03:57] little bit up if you dare you can say
[1:03:59] Amen
[1:04:00] this is the first scripture that we read
[1:04:02] and we identify that it's John the
[1:04:04] Baptist now we are on the second one now
[1:04:08] and as they departed verse 7 Jesus
[1:04:11] begins to say to the multitude
[1:04:13] concerning who John so this is Jesus
[1:04:16] talking what went you out into the
[1:04:20] wilderness to see so John was in the
[1:04:21] wilderness
[1:04:22] it reads shaken with the wind
[1:04:25] but what went you out to see a man
[1:04:28] clothed in soft raiment behold a that
[1:04:31] were soft gray trim clothing are in
[1:04:33] King's houses but what went you out to
[1:04:37] see a
[1:04:38] prophet so Jesus identified John as a
[1:04:42] prophet
[1:04:43] everybody clear we going by the Bible
[1:04:46] not in the zodiac not in the pyramid in
[1:04:49] the Bible okay yeah I say to you and
[1:04:55] more than a prophet
[1:04:57] so John was not just a prophet but more
[1:05:00] than a prophet why was John more than a
[1:05:03] prophet
[1:05:06] you need a prophet to know why John was
[1:05:10] more than a prophet
[1:05:12] brother Branham in a true sign that is
[1:05:16] overlooked he said but what one I you to
[1:05:18] see what Branham is reading the same
[1:05:20] scripture a prophet listen yeah and I
[1:05:23] say unto you and more than a prophet yes
[1:05:27] sir what was he say he's more than a
[1:05:31] prophet he was a prophet plus
[1:05:35] he was the messenger of that
[1:05:40] we got that clear
[1:05:42] second coat God hiding himself in
[1:05:44] simplicity I can give you more I just
[1:05:47] choose to so we can move on so when you
[1:05:50] listen to your tape yourself when you
[1:05:52] cut when you say I remember are you
[1:05:54] there now why was he more than a prophet
[1:05:58] he was the messenger of the Covenant
[1:06:01] remember the lesson of the Covenant is
[1:06:04] God and the messenger of the Covenant is
[1:06:07] also John if you go to Revelation then
[1:06:11] you find out that there is a messenger
[1:06:14] down and there is a messenger coming up
[1:06:17] one is coming ganas de Maria angel and
[1:06:20] one is on the earth it is a son of man a
[1:06:24] son of men but one son of men reveal
[1:06:27] this son of man are we clear
[1:06:31] okay now he was the messenger of the
[1:06:35] Covenant sure he was to bridge the way
[1:06:38] between law and grace he was the key
[1:06:43] stone brother branham say every single
[1:06:46] prophet spoke or prophesy about Jesus
[1:06:51] Christ Moses spoke he never seen him
[1:06:54] maybe in vision as a a spoke in vision
[1:06:58] Abraham spoke all of them in vision but
[1:07:02] what one I'm saying when John the
[1:07:04] Baptist came he was not only prophesying
[1:07:07] by John went to the people that this is
[1:07:11] he behold the Lamb of God that takes
[1:07:14] away the sin of the world he was not
[1:07:17] just prophesy but he actually
[1:07:20] identified the lamb by pointing him
[1:07:23] straight ahead and he was the Keystone
[1:07:25] that bridges in other word he was the
[1:07:28] yellow light you know there is a green
[1:07:32] there is a red and a yellow before green
[1:07:37] goes to red he passes through yellow is
[1:07:40] the yellow yard that is combining the
[1:07:43] two dispossession are you there when the
[1:07:46] light is yellow you can still pass and
[1:07:49] you don't have any trouble
[1:07:51] when he turned red then the dispensation
[1:07:53] of the law is finished but John was
[1:07:56] that's what they call an overlapping are
[1:07:59] you there the Keystone getting low
[1:08:02] English who came together and where the
[1:08:04] past under event Gentile
[1:08:09] either even the Centurion Roman could
[1:08:14] come and get healing even the sorrowful
[1:08:17] Eastern woman she tried in a Jewish way
[1:08:20] son of David son of David son of David
[1:08:23] then a resonation struck is a son of God
[1:08:25] he was not the dispensation of son of
[1:08:28] God yet but because the light was yellow
[1:08:31] so
[1:08:34] are you there when the light turned
[1:08:37] completely red eek aboard to Israel the
[1:08:41] glory of the Lord left there and went to
[1:08:44] the gentle
[1:08:46] everybody clear so far so John was more
[1:08:50] than a prophet let's continue now for
[1:08:54] this is he we already read this
[1:08:56] that is called we already read this
[1:09:00] already this is he of whom it is written
[1:09:02] behold I send my messenger
[1:09:05] before your face which shall prepare the
[1:09:09] way before you so now we found out that
[1:09:12] Jesus is identifying to us that Malachi
[1:09:15] 3 is rule John the Baptist and we
[1:09:18] explained to you on the teaching of the
[1:09:20] web shift that a person may have
[1:09:22] multiple scripture Isaiah 40 Malachi 3
[1:09:27] all of that and Malachi 4 you look at
[1:09:31] the scripture it's still talking about
[1:09:32] John the Baptist that's why jesus also
[1:09:36] have this prophet this prophet this
[1:09:39] prophet this prophet and you put it
[1:09:41] together and brother Branham also have
[1:09:43] revelation 10 Malachi 4 Luke 1730
[1:09:46] Zechariah 14 John 2:12 all of that you
[1:09:50] put together you Fonda it's a wave shift
[1:09:53] are you there everybody clear so he was
[1:09:56] greater than all his name is Elijah the
[1:10:00] Prophet we already read that now let's
[1:10:02] go to mark chapter 1
[1:10:04] we are dealing with John the Baptist
[1:10:09] we want to clear him completely so when
[1:10:13] we drop with brother Branham is clear
[1:10:15] mark chapter 1 now we found out that in
[1:10:19] John chapter 1
[1:10:21] under Baptist say he was as a ax folding
[1:10:25] we found out the malla in Matthew
[1:10:27] chapter 11 Jesus say he was not only as
[1:10:30] their 40 he was also Malachi 3 okay now
[1:10:34] let's take these two and put them
[1:10:36] together
[1:10:38] are you there mark chapter 1 verse 1 the
[1:10:42] beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:10:44] the Son of God as it is written in the
[1:10:47] prophet behold I send my messenger
[1:10:50] before your face which shall prepare
[1:10:52] your way before you who's that one
[1:10:56] Malachi 3 everybody clear we clear there
[1:11:01] look at the second verse
[1:11:03] you find them together look at the
[1:11:06] second verse the voice of the one crying
[1:11:09] in the wilderness prepare you the way of
[1:11:12] the Lord make his paths straight
[1:11:15] so they put Malachi 3 and they put
[1:11:18] Isaiah 40 the combined mark a pastor in
[1:11:22] Knox of the team put them together for
[1:11:25] you are you there then the next verse he
[1:11:28] said John you
[1:11:30] see did baptize in the wilderness and
[1:11:35] preached the baptism of repentance for
[1:11:37] remission of what sin so we have three
[1:11:41] scripture 1 John's am Isaiah 40 the
[1:11:45] second one Jesus say he's Malachi 3 but
[1:11:48] mark say this and this let me make your
[1:11:51] life easy I put him together each one
[1:11:53] person everybody clear now alright now
[1:11:57] let's go when John the Baptist come he's
[1:12:01] introducing who the Lord that's what we
[1:12:04] saw here they say the Lord whom you seek
[1:12:07] and we found out every time the find him
[1:12:10] they go that we have found them we have
[1:12:13] found are you there even the woman at
[1:12:17] the world went ahead and say hey there
[1:12:19] is somebody who told me is not this the
[1:12:22] Messiah in other words I have found the
[1:12:25] Messiah because they were seeking the
[1:12:28] Messiah everybody clear so far but they
[1:12:30] say the Lord whom you seek
[1:12:33] now who is the Lord
[1:12:39] take second Corinthians chapter 3
[1:12:44] the Bible interpreting the Bible
[1:12:49] and don't say brother Steven say or our
[1:12:53] pastor say no the Bible say brother
[1:12:57] Branham say everybody
[1:13:00] second Corinthians chapter three
[1:13:04] are you there
[1:13:07] verse 17 everybody clear now though
[1:13:13] can you say it aloud now their Lord is
[1:13:19] the spirit
[1:13:22] so right here
[1:13:25] when they refer to the Lord they're
[1:13:28] talking about the Spirit of God
[1:13:32] entering into a temple
[1:13:36] is it clear but the interest of the
[1:13:40] Spirit of the Lord must be in the
[1:13:43] Ministry of John because we know
[1:13:46] journeys Isaiah 40 and Malachi 3
[1:13:50] everybody clear okay now the Lord is the
[1:13:54] spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord
[1:13:58] is there is Liberty
[1:14:00] freedom everybody there we don't want
[1:14:03] denominational everybody there now if
[1:14:07] the Lord is the spirit enter the temple
[1:14:11] so we know that at the dedication of the
[1:14:15] temple of Salomon in the Old Testament
[1:14:18] the pillar of fire came
[1:14:21] enter that temple but when John the
[1:14:24] Baptist came the temple will already
[1:14:27] have the anointing of the Spirit through
[1:14:30] Solomon and the tabernacle have the
[1:14:33] anointing of the Spirit under Moses but
[1:14:37] John is coming and the Bible said that
[1:14:39] the Spirit of the Lord will enter a
[1:14:42] temple is he going to enter the
[1:14:44] tabernacle which he always the anointed
[1:14:47] is he gonna enter the Temple of Solomon
[1:14:49] which temple is the spirit entering him
[1:14:54] are we clear now let's take at chapter 7
[1:15:04] you should be able to sit with somebody
[1:15:07] and begin to show them 1 2 3 4 and you
[1:15:11] bring them to church and we baptize them
[1:15:13] and we pray for them and they get the
[1:15:15] Holy Ghost
[1:15:17] are you there
[1:15:21] up to chapter 7 if you dare you can say
[1:15:24] Amen verse 44 our Father had the
[1:15:29] tabernacle number 1 there was a
[1:15:32] tabernacle and we know that the
[1:15:34] tabernacle was dedicated under Moses
[1:15:37] when they put the Ark of the Covenant
[1:15:39] the anointing of God came
[1:15:42] our Father had the tabernacle of witness
[1:15:45] in the wilderness as he had appointed
[1:15:48] speaking to Moses that he should make it
[1:15:51] according to the fashion that he had
[1:15:53] seen he was made according to the
[1:15:55] fashion of heaven which also our Father
[1:15:57] that came after brought in with Joshua
[1:16:01] that Jesus is Joshua Joshua into the
[1:16:04] possession of the Gentile whom God drove
[1:16:06] out before the face of our Father to the
[1:16:09] days of David in other words they left
[1:16:11] Egypt they went to the desert now they
[1:16:13] in the promised land are you there who
[1:16:15] found the favor David before God and
[1:16:19] desired to find a tabernacle for the God
[1:16:21] of Jacob but Solomon built him a house
[1:16:25] so we are moving from a tabernacle to a
[1:16:28] temple the Temple of Solomon but we know
[1:16:31] this was anointed the pillar of fire
[1:16:34] came this also was anointed the pillar
[1:16:37] of fire came but which temple is the
[1:16:40] Lord which temple is the Spirit of God
[1:16:42] which temple is the anointing of God
[1:16:45] going to enter suddenly
[1:16:49] verse 47 but Solomon built him a house
[1:16:53] verse verse 48
[1:16:56] however
[1:16:58] habit the Messiah do are not in temple
[1:17:03] made with oh my god in other word they
[1:17:07] time for this and the time for this is
[1:17:10] already finished there should be another
[1:17:13] temple they have built the most high to
[1:17:17] have not in temple made with hand as he
[1:17:20] said I says the prophet verse 49 heaven
[1:17:24] is my throne and earth is my footstool
[1:17:26] what has with you built me say the Lord
[1:17:30] or what is the place of my rest God had
[1:17:33] the tabernacle he moved from the
[1:17:35] tabernacle to the temple now God is
[1:17:37] still looking for a house he said which
[1:17:40] house are you going to build me you
[1:17:43] bring me the tabernacle are not
[1:17:44] satisfied I was not in peace I was not
[1:17:48] arrested you built me the temple are not
[1:17:50] satisfied what house will you build me
[1:17:53] so that I can have rest
[1:17:56] but the house must not be built again by
[1:18:00] man hand because the first one trouble
[1:18:03] the second one trouble I don't want any
[1:18:06] man hands house I want a house that is
[1:18:09] made by God himself
[1:18:12] where is the house Hebrew chapter 10
[1:18:17] please don't cut me on my time
[1:18:20] let me finish John the Baptist
[1:18:26] everybody there
[1:18:28] we will preach preach preach like Peter
[1:18:31] and suddenly the Holy Spirit would drop
[1:18:33] him
[1:18:39] there were a hundred and twenty people
[1:18:41] in the upper room did anybody miss the
[1:18:44] Holy Ghost
[1:18:48] so there is a possibility for an entire
[1:18:51] trade to be filled with the Holy Spirit
[1:18:55] are you there in the hands of Cornelius
[1:18:59] Cornelius call his entire house and call
[1:19:02] his friend the Bible said when the Holy
[1:19:04] Ghost kept all of them did anybody miss
[1:19:07] it so this time let's pray for all of us
[1:19:11] to receive the Holy Ghost
[1:19:17] Hebrews chapter 10 verse 5 if you dare
[1:19:20] you can say Amen
[1:19:22] we're for when he comes into the world
[1:19:25] he says sacrifice and offering you would
[1:19:29] not but our
[1:19:30] body Oh
[1:19:33] a body have you prepared me this was a
[1:19:37] tabernacle this is a temple now we are
[1:19:41] talking about a body brother Steven is a
[1:19:45] body a temple
[1:19:48] in burnt offering and sacrifice
[1:19:52] for sin you have no pleasure in other
[1:19:55] word God doesn't like again what is
[1:19:58] going on in the temple he's tired of it
[1:20:01] are you there job 2 verse 10 by the
[1:20:05] which will we are sanctified through the
[1:20:09] offering of the body of Jesus Christ
[1:20:11] once for all
[1:20:13] so now we move from Tabernacle to temple
[1:20:17] but God still say I need the rest I need
[1:20:20] to ask some boy
[1:20:22] but they prepare God a body and we
[1:20:26] trying to find whether the body is the
[1:20:27] temple or not
[1:20:29] clear ceases Adi
[1:20:31] let's go to John chapter 2
[1:20:39] what we do on Chapter two if you dare
[1:20:42] you can say Amen
[1:20:44] verse 19 I want you all to see this
[1:20:48] yourself
[1:20:51] are you there
[1:20:53] Jesus answering and say to them Jesus
[1:20:57] came out from the temple he say here
[1:21:00] they were looking at the temple which
[1:21:01] temple the Temple of Solomon you see the
[1:21:04] transition Jesus is here he's not
[1:21:08] talking about this is he now Jesus is
[1:21:10] fed the temple they say Lord look at
[1:21:12] this it's so great it's so beautiful
[1:21:15] it's this and this and when Jesus came
[1:21:17] out he said destroy this temple the
[1:21:21] temple so everybody said oh he's talking
[1:21:24] about the Temple of Solomon
[1:21:25] sacrifice and offering I don't have any
[1:21:28] more pleasure day because you become
[1:21:30] denomination
[1:21:32] destroy this temple and in three days I
[1:21:36] will raise it up also a temple will be
[1:21:40] destroyed and raised up in three days
[1:21:42] what is that temple the Lord whom you
[1:21:46] seek will enter into the temple suddenly
[1:21:51] okay verse 20 then say the Jews forty
[1:21:57] and six years in other words Solomon
[1:21:59] took forty and six years was this temple
[1:22:02] built they still looking at the Temple
[1:22:04] of Solomon they say huh you they took 46
[1:22:08] years and you say three days you want to
[1:22:10] erect this temple forty and six years
[1:22:13] was this temple in a building and you
[1:22:16] will hear it up in three days
[1:22:21] watch verse 21 but he spoke of the
[1:22:25] temple of his oh
[1:22:27] my god so the body of the Lord is a and
[1:22:33] according to the Ministry of John the
[1:22:36] Baptist the Lord which is the spirit
[1:22:38] will enter suddenly into
[1:22:42] he already entered in the tabernacle he
[1:22:45] already entered in the temple of Salomon
[1:22:47] but now the Spirit of the Lord will
[1:22:50] enter into the
[1:22:52] body
[1:22:54] and
[1:22:56] John the Baptist must be there
[1:23:01] at the river of Jordan
[1:23:07] let's go with this a
[1:23:11] little father I wish we could get on
[1:23:13] this lesson a little further down there
[1:23:16] he said this Tabernacle he said brother
[1:23:19] Branham Solomon built him a tabernacle
[1:23:22] but the most high the scripture gave you
[1:23:25] do LF not in the house made both hand
[1:23:29] but L do you see how brother Branham
[1:23:33] Poole description put the scripture and
[1:23:35] put he's taking Ebru and that I gave you
[1:23:37] and he took out and he who come together
[1:23:40] I know that's how I make my slide
[1:23:44] so he doesn't come from my head are you
[1:23:48] there by the body has that prepared me
[1:23:51] when Solomon built their temple oh
[1:23:54] brother Branham say Tabernacle Solomon
[1:23:57] never built the tabernacle
[1:23:58] you got your correction here so no worry
[1:24:01] when Solomon built the temple
[1:24:04] Jehovah he is a good one here is a good
[1:24:08] one hallelujah what is wrong with
[1:24:10] brother Branham whatever Ana begin to
[1:24:13] scream hallelujah what's wrong
[1:24:15] that caught just right in exploration
[1:24:18] structure at random he said thank you
[1:24:21] thank the Lord for that here is a
[1:24:23] revelation just fresh right now when
[1:24:27] brother Branham took the scripture this
[1:24:29] scripture put him together God struck a
[1:24:32] revelation and what I want to begin to
[1:24:35] scribble he say you are going together
[1:24:37] brother Branham we are all so excited
[1:24:39] tell us what is the revelation now
[1:24:42] brother Branham is going to tell us he
[1:24:44] says when Solomon built the temple and
[1:24:47] he was dedicated God came into the
[1:24:50] temple into a
[1:24:52] we already explained that is that right
[1:24:54] and when Jesus class was dedicated to
[1:24:58] God on the river of Jordan God the
[1:25:04] spirit John chapter 4 do Jesus thought
[1:25:08] the woman at the well God is a spirit
[1:25:11] right whether God came down and dwell in
[1:25:16] Jesus Christ he is Jehovah Emin
[1:25:21] confession of sin always had to look to
[1:25:24] Al the temple confession of sin have to
[1:25:27] look to Christ in other word we're now
[1:25:30] confessing to a temple in Jerusalem but
[1:25:33] our temple now is in heaven are you
[1:25:35] there there is the temple of God
[1:25:39] God you are in Christ there it is now
[1:25:43] you believe he's your don't you never
[1:25:46] thought of that before it's an
[1:25:48] inspiration that struck him are you
[1:25:51] there alright now let's take mark
[1:25:54] chapter 1
[1:26:07] I
[1:26:07] hope I'm not it's not tired to read
[1:26:10] those scripture
[1:26:12] but men shall not believe by bread alone
[1:26:16] mark chapter 1 verse 10 are you there
[1:26:19] we're talking about the Lord the Spirit
[1:26:22] God entering into the temple now we
[1:26:26] understand that the Spirit of God will
[1:26:29] enter into a body but it's going to be
[1:26:32] sudden
[1:26:34] quick are you there mark chapter 10
[1:26:38] chapter 1 verse 10 and immediately this
[1:26:42] is John taking Jesus Christ are you
[1:26:44] there and put him in order right and
[1:26:47] when he pulled Jesus Christ
[1:26:50] immediately not slowly
[1:26:54] immediately the Lord gets there suddenly
[1:27:00] immediately coming out of the water he
[1:27:04] saw the heavens open and
[1:27:08] the spirit here back again the Spirit is
[1:27:12] the
[1:27:13] idea he saw the spirit like a dove
[1:27:18] that's the form the spirit took because
[1:27:21] God is amorphous he can change form but
[1:27:25] the spirit in that particular event took
[1:27:28] the doves the Dove and the lamb are
[1:27:31] joining together heaven an Elfa kissing
[1:27:36] either they spirit like a dove
[1:27:39] descending upon him how
[1:27:42] immediately who's doing this John the
[1:27:46] Baptist before the messenger preparing
[1:27:50] the way he is preparing the way of the
[1:27:52] Lord but when he prepared the way under
[1:27:56] his ministry the Lord the Spirit of the
[1:27:59] Lord will enter into a body the body of
[1:28:02] Jesus Christ quickly
[1:28:07] we clear now
[1:28:10] let's go to Luke chapter three
[1:28:16] Luke chapter three verse 21
[1:28:26] if you dare you can say Amen
[1:28:31] now when all the people were baptized so
[1:28:36] they were taking people baptized out
[1:28:39] that does out everybody there he came to
[1:28:43] pass that Jesus also be baptized and
[1:28:47] pray so when they were baptizing Jesus
[1:28:51] he was praying
[1:28:53] you see keys in the scripture are you
[1:28:57] there and playing the heaven was opened
[1:29:01] and the Holy Ghost which is the Lord the
[1:29:05] Spirit of the Lord descended in a bodily
[1:29:09] shape like a dove upon him and a voice
[1:29:12] came from heaven which said you are my
[1:29:15] beloved Son in whom I am well pleased
[1:29:18] God was looking for a temple God was
[1:29:22] looking for a tabernacle but under the
[1:29:25] ministry of john he's going to present
[1:29:27] the Messiah but the Lord the Spirit of
[1:29:31] God the Holy Ghost in the form of a dog
[1:29:34] will enter the body of Jesus Christ
[1:29:36] suddenly are you there that's why John
[1:29:40] is Malachi 3
[1:29:44] John is as a ax Ferdie brother branham
[1:29:49] the positions the believers position
[1:29:52] across what did he speak of the Lord
[1:29:55] Jesus Christ for God then came to his
[1:29:58] temple in a pillar of fire we know it
[1:30:01] said our form when the temple was made a
[1:30:05] worship place for all Israel to come
[1:30:08] together the pillar of fire came in over
[1:30:11] the great 70 foot wings of the angels
[1:30:14] that's the Temple of Solomon went back
[1:30:17] over along the angels on the wall in
[1:30:20] other word he travel going there into
[1:30:22] the Holy of Holies went back to the
[1:30:25] mercy seat which was the throne where
[1:30:27] the two great 14-foot brass Caribbeans
[1:30:30] set with their wings pitched to one
[1:30:33] another and set up rested a God coming
[1:30:37] to his temple to be worshipped from the
[1:30:40] temple where the blood outside made an
[1:30:44] atonement then when crust came on earth
[1:30:48] when he was baptized in Jordan as the
[1:30:53] washing of the lamb and the Brazile ever
[1:30:56] noticed then John bear record seeing the
[1:31:00] Spirit of God like a dove coming from
[1:31:03] above and he said on him and went into
[1:31:08] him God coming to his
[1:31:15] never over here ah
[1:31:18] now you are men and women most of you
[1:31:23] and you are God's children not all over
[1:31:25] look it remember that we are supposed to
[1:31:27] have these things they are supposed to
[1:31:30] happen in this day in this hour that we
[1:31:32] are living in this is the hour just
[1:31:35] before the coming of the Messiah that we
[1:31:37] supposed to be an announcement come
[1:31:39] forth from God let me drop behold I will
[1:31:43] send my messenger and he shall prepare
[1:31:46] the way before me and the Lord now you
[1:31:49] understand what it means whom you seek
[1:31:51] shall suddenly come to his temple you
[1:31:54] know now what it means even the
[1:31:56] messenger of the Covenant whom you
[1:31:58] delight in the Lord he shall come say
[1:32:01] the Lord vertebra damn explain this
[1:32:03] messenger he said that was John and
[1:32:06] nothing the coming of Jesus and he came
[1:32:10] to the temple
[1:32:11] exactly what he said the messenger of
[1:32:15] the Covenant the angel you see that was
[1:32:18] in the wilderness with the disciple of
[1:32:22] will with Israel do you believe he was
[1:32:25] the messenger so brother branham is
[1:32:28] again confirming to you that the Lord
[1:32:31] God enter into his temple how quickly
[1:32:35] the Lord enter to his temple and when
[1:32:37] you get both of this in John chapter 1
[1:32:40] 31 and 24 you wanna put those together
[1:32:43] and the next time part 16 God richly
[1:32:47] bless you
[1:32:49] [Applause]
[1:32:57] let's then
[1:33:04] we should be able to preach or to exhort
[1:33:08] somebody about John the Baptist
[1:33:12] let's pray
[1:33:17] Heavenly Father
[1:33:19] Lord we thank you for your grace your
[1:33:22] love and again your mercy father we can
[1:33:25] never enforce eyes on those word
[1:33:28] Lord you moved from the tabernacle and
[1:33:32] you went into the temple and from the
[1:33:35] tempo you didn't stop there because the
[1:33:38] temple only provided a substitute for
[1:33:43] seen the Old Testament seen were just
[1:33:46] covered Lord that's why they were held
[1:33:48] in paradise but father you move further
[1:33:51] because you are completed in three Lord
[1:33:55] Tabernacle temple and then the body of
[1:33:59] Jesus Christ always completed in three
[1:34:01] and the third is always perfection and
[1:34:04] you are our perfection and the Father
[1:34:07] you're coming down provided the perfect
[1:34:10] lamb for our sacrifice Lord father and
[1:34:13] now we don't have to look through a
[1:34:15] tabernacle or through a temple Lord but
[1:34:18] we have Lord Father another temple of
[1:34:21] God that is living Lord that was raised
[1:34:24] up in three days and that is sitting on
[1:34:27] the throne of God as a memorial Lord
[1:34:29] interceding for us father Lord we thank
[1:34:32] you for opening our eyes laws and
[1:34:35] stabilizing us Lord Father we know that
[1:34:38] your work did not stop there because
[1:34:40] your prophet told us that the first time
[1:34:42] that you came you wanted to have a
[1:34:45] preeminence in Christ which you did Lord
[1:34:48] Father and we demonstrated tonight Lord
[1:34:50] how you get into his temple because the
[1:34:53] Word was made flesh in him dwelleth the
[1:34:56] fullness of the Godhead bodily Lord
[1:34:59] Father but we didn't stop there
[1:35:01] you yourself spoke through your own lips
[1:35:04] Lord you say that if somebody receives
[1:35:07] you and hear your word you will come to
[1:35:10] him and you gonna make his body your
[1:35:13] house Lord so that temple never stopped
[1:35:16] at you Lord because on the day of
