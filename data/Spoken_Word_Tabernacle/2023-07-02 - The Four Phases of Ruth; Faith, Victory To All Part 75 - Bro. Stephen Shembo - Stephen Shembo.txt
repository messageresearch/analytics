blessed be the name of the Lord I already purchased it for you so if you don't want to read it that's between you and the Lord Lord's willing I believe the speaker of the house is here it's going to be August the 26th right for the young sister's meeting so it's already confirmed is he confirmed can you say Amen should I hand you the microphone so August the 26th will be the young Sisters Meeting so you let me know where the venue will be you know how you're doing stuff amen so just let me know on time amen uh and I'm still waiting on the patriarch the young Brothers meeting so brother able I don't see him here this morning so whenever you're gonna catch up just let me know when the uh if it's confirmed for July about the young Brothers meeting amen our question and answer for this month July will be the 22nd there was a conflict with our special meeting place so we will have it in church instead of that place so hopefully it won't rain so we can Fellowship a little bit outside and then come into the church so the date is still the same July 22nd but it's going to be here in the church everybody heard me praise be to the name of the Lord Lord's will in you pray for me on July the 12th which is not this coming Wednesday but the Wednesday that follow I will try to get in teach us how to pray part two so you're gonna be there you'll be there are you gonna be there amen so let's see if I can try to beat 30 minutes and pray if I can but you will need to learn how to pray amen amen you know when I preach and you see me getting mad I'm not mad at you you will see my face sometimes is closed I'm not mad at you I'm mad at the teaching you they put in you in this message that's what I'm mad about because when when the word is coming that teaching is fighting me yeah because that that teaching want to keep you in bondage so I'm mad about the traditions that they poking to you in this message so that's why I say say Amen uh because I want you to say Amen then you can break the spirit so when I say say Amen when you say Amen then the word get into you amen so don't say the pastor is preaching he's mad no I love you but I'm mad about the devil that is trying to block you from accessing the very benefit of God amen so we know one another pretty good by heart amen so July the 12th Wednesday we will go Lord's willing with prayer teach us how to pray part two and see how far we can go if you send me a text and you're waiting on the counseling or you send me a message or something I have not replied please be patient amen I am loaded I'm traveling through a traffic I'm I'm I'm doing things as I receive them according to their order so if somebody was behind you I gotta deal with him first then I move on to you and things I know there is an emergency we always keep an emergency uh room open like in an emergency room even if it's food they always have a room that is the vacant in case somebody got shot or something they have to take you quickly so that room is still there if there is an emergency but if it's not an emergency just be patient with me I will answer according to the way I receive it sometimes I'm bombarded with texts and emails so just be patient I'm there sometime I read you but I have to wait for the big boss to give me the answer about what to tell you I can get an answer quickly sometime you might take two four days I have to depend on the Lord because I don't want you to say brother Stephen say I want you to say the Lord have said amen brother Robert ask me a question and it was quite interesting I didn't want to put my my hand on there because I know if I put my hand on there I'm gonna get lost but eventually I put my hand on it so and I realized that he was not brother Robert he was the Holy Spirit open Matthew chapter 5 verse 3. when you get quiet it's not good it makes the devil nervous not me my brother you there on time you got your microphone okay When you pray at home before service you pray like me because we're preaching together if not you're gonna get some fight because I get fight so whoever brother Angelo whoever maybe one day Brother David whoever will be preaching with me make sure your prayer over David is looking left and back maybe brother Isaac whoever is here the patriarch he's checking his hand like oh my God foreign let's go to Matthew chapter 5 verse 3. yeah is that what you asked me brother Robert Matthew 5 verse 3 yeah that was yesterday I tried to run away from it but it seems like it's something we need to deal with it amen amen you understand Prosperity now right right if you don't I will push it back again uh uh everybody there let's read my friend blessed are the poor in water spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven what does he mean the Bible say blessed are you when you are poor in spirit so you must be poor in spirit do you see the way we interpret the scripture the Bible say blessed are those that are how who are in what Spirit ah so we must have a poverty mind sir no sir do you see how we interpret the scripture what does it mean poor in spirit because I'm saying the majority of Christians are poor I have the code brother Branham say God's children also are rich let's take both of them but the Bible say blessed are those that are poor in the spirit so you must be poor and then we get more anointing don't get quiet I didn't read my word Matthew 5 verse 3 the Bible say blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of water heaven the Bible didn't say blessed are the poor in money no sir did the bible say that we the one that put that when we say blessed are the poor in spirit we put poor and money the Bible say blessed are the poor naughty money I put it on the board you have it on your lap not in money that's us who interpret that the Bible is very specific poor in spirit so in the spirit you must be poor what does it mean poor in spirit amen we know that man has three parts everybody okay we have the body we have the soul and we have water spirit and God say I want you to be poor in spirit everybody okay everybody okay in other words we know that the spirit direct the brain can you say Amen say just a man if you say Amen you will understand it hi everybody okay and we know that the soul is in the heart everybody okay amen and the Bible said blessed are those that are poor away in spirit [Applause] everybody good why because the way God created man Man was created to be dependent Man was created to depend on someone amen even though Adam was the God of this Earth he had to stay in connection that's right when Adam cut his connection everything fell because man must be in depth not independent but dependent yes sir if I don't get to what I want to preach that's fine because some of you take a long time to crank everybody okay yeah I have to push push push push that's why you need to pray yourself at home so when I'm here we are moving correctly because you're dragging me back everybody okay Jeremiah 10 verse 23 oh Lord I know that the way of a man is not in water himself it is not in men that walketh to do water direct his steps you have to be dependent that's right no matter how smart you are you need to be dependent that's right [Applause] the Bible say in Proverbs 21 verse 2 every way of a man is how right in which I his own eyes that's why you need to be poor in the spirit Hallelujah everybody okay a poor in spirit is somebody who is depressed or he's lacking something in the spirit in other words it's somebody who recognize how much is unable on himself amen it's is it complicated no sir it's somebody who understands that spiritually speaking if he doesn't get help he's gonna be in trouble that's right it's a man that is humble in his own eyes it is a man that has a humble opinion about himself amen it is a man that reckon us his poverty in his ability oh man it doesn't mean poor in money I know I'm shaking message Believers I know how you believe but since I'm independent according to the church I depend on the big boss but I don't have a bishop the only Bishop is the Lord Jesus Christ amen so I don't have to preach something to please a preacher no sir okay brother brother the Bible say trust in the water lord how with all thine heart and lean not unto thy own water understanding in all the ways do what acknowledge Him and He will direct water bypass be not twice in the own water I God wants you to be poor in the spirit amen [Applause] [Music] this is you interpreting what did Brother Branham say amen say amen amen this is after the seals can you say amen amen this is after the opening of the seals thank you we don't have to be supporting water money we shall have to be poor in water spirit naughty money in the spirited we last that God with that you I can do nothing yeah okay and the more you understand your inability in the spirit the more God can work with you that's right when we are weak then he is [Music] brother Robert did I answer your question because I know her the religious devil will come back and try to Corner you yeah your practice preach this by whatever the scripture [Music] money take people away from God had a wonderful time this week down at brother bertrams placed there and I went into the factory where they made the cheese I see he by the Virgin and his wife and son and them are present this morning and I always thought at the cheese factory will be something like other places I've been in all kind of sloppy and dirty mind I can say one thing you can show a rest assured that that place is not dirty brother Branham went to a factory of a brother and he thought the factory is going to be dirty when he get into the factory he found a clean Factory of this brother brother Bertram everybody okay they're making cheese amen that was the cleanest place I ever went into and especially in a factory I didn't realize I thought oh maybe they shall make a hundred pound of cheese the water a day what a brand I'm thought they making only a hundred pound of cheese a day but brother Branham say and they make what six times water each day and three of the factory how going I thought oh my who eat all this cheese so this brother got three Factory going on making six stones of cheese every day this brother with a lot of money like this he's gonna be away from the Lord he was like God brother Branham say but the Lord did what has blessed this man I had the privilege of being in water his home a very lovely water oh a bad wife no sir foreign consecrated wife and there is no reason why they should not leave for Christ each day as they are doing [Music] [Applause] the blessing of God in this brother's life keep him more closer to God Amen amen yes sir keep swallowing I know I know no and no message believer I know I met his son and they are very bad children fine children their son are good children their wife is consecrated and the brother live for Christ despite everything that God gave it to him after the opening of the seals why did God bless John charity why out come on God's blessing will bring you closer to him amen the more He blesses you the more you are clinging to him that's right he wants you to be poor in water spirit amen are we clear now let's go to our scripture this morning whoever is still struggling you got some pills if you continue I will bring more scripture I gave it to brother Robert yesterday if I pull the scripture now some of you will scream we have to put things in the right perspective too much extreme until we put people in a millennium tomorrow we remove them in a millennium tomorrow Jesus is already come tomorrow Jesus have not come and then the people are confused and we keep our ending that's right people outside I wish and then we we Comfort ourselves no when the Lord come all this thing will be finished all these bad marriages there will be fixed on the other side who told you you are in the bad one even though your husband is bad who told you this is not your husband brother Branham say it will be fixed by who told you this is not their husband who told you that and what do we do we Let The Devil Ride on the husband because I'm waiting for the next time whatever if you go to heaven and you see him again what are you gonna do because you don't know before he died in the hospital he can repent and you see him on the other side they say that's the one do you know which wife God gives to Moses with a high temperance don't worry buddy I will shake you shake shake shake shake let's go to Genesis chapter one brother Caleb I hope this won't mess up the camera again I changed to the green color to see how it's gonna go yeah because the purple I don't know what's going on but green is alive it's fine in case you wonder it's life Genesis chapter 1 verse 11. if you dare you can say Amen verse 11 you ready my brother yes sir praise God and God say let the Earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after each kind whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and he was so you might be seated glory to God so God before he created the trees all the fruit trees God spoke to the Earth amen because those things were in the Earth and God spoke to the Earth and say you Earth bring me this this this this and they came out of the Earth in other words the fruit trees and everything else came originated from the Earth any problem and job to verse 20. glory to God I mean a big traffic jam of Revelation so I have to go slowly because the more I try to push the more it's it's coming okay so I can't fly with this especially when you take a long time to say Amen then I have to wait until you say Amen we need a battery bar together verse 20 and God said let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that his life and found that may fly above the Earth in the open firmament of water heaven I have another scripture that the fly the bird and everything came from the Dust but the dust that was in the water so in other words God spoke to the one everybody okay and the bird came are we okay thank you job to verse 24. if you dare you can say amen amen and God say let the Earth bring forth the living creature after its kind a and creeping things thank you my brother and beast of the earth after it's kind and it was so everybody clear so to produce the trees God spoke to the Earth so the tree came from the Earth right the animal came from the Earth the bird the fish is everything came out of something now verse 26. thank you my brother and God say let us make how man in our own image and our own likeness which material did God spoke to him to create the trees God spoke to the Earth to create the the fishes God went and spoke to the water to create the Beast of the field God went and spoke to the Earth but when he was time to create man God begin to talk to himself in other words the material that produced man amen oh man I'm not talking about this no sir I'm talking about but you know you know my language right not this bad you know my language right now to produce man God went to himself to find a material in him [Applause] the real you never came from the Earth [Applause] the one that we bury in the cemetery never came from that that's not you that's a vehicle say closing but the real youth you came from a deity material amen that's why Jesus say I come from and I'm going backwards [Applause] [Music] [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay and this species let me ask you a question there's an elephant look like God does a tree look like God does a fish look like God but man when they pull him not only is he having the same material like God but he must look like God not only the image even the likeness [Applause] everybody okay verse 26 let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them Dominion so the man that have dominion is not this one [Music] am I reading a different Bible everybody okay dominion over the water the fish of the sea over the water the and offer the water the Carol of the water all the Earth and offer every creeping things that creepeth upon water the Earth so whatever was created before man is on the man follow me [Music] so God created man in his own image in the image of who God I am not in the image of Satan no sir when God was created me he put himself and he began to look at himself and say yes sir yeah yes sir in the image of God created him how male and female created he watered them and God blessed them [Applause] the blessing of the Lord does what are you afraid are you afraid your pastor is not afraid so you must be like me follow me as I follow right everybody okay God bless them amen God didn't bless this one [Music] everybody okay everybody okay amen God bless them and say to them be water fruitful God didn't say you shall be fruitful no sir when God was blessing them he was in the present tense so once God said be fruitful other medically man is already fruitful [Applause] instantaneously be fruitful now but if you notice man didn't have the body [Applause] he didn't have the guardians but he was already fruitful in the spirit I am here so your ability to multiply doesn't depend on this [Applause] it depends on who is inside that's the man I'm trying to free amen [Applause] okay no problem be fruitful and water multiply and do what replenish the Earth and do water subdue it and have water Dominion how is the spirit man going to do this he doesn't have a body but without a body he can multiply he can replenish the Earth how is he going to do that thank you Jesus offer the file of the offer the fish of the sea over the fall of the year and over every living thing that moveth upon the Water the Earth verse 29 glory to God and God say behold I have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of the Earth and every tree in the which is fruit of the tree yielding water see to you eat water shall is he present or what so the food is Future because the spiritual man cannot eat fruit [Applause] the man in Genesis 1 26 can I eat an apple that's why God said I'm giving you your diet for the future so when I'm gonna put you in the body in Genesis 2 7 now you can eat the apple are we okay so right here we have two men amen we have two men we have a now man a spirit man amen which is already undued with all potential amen so and we have another man that is coming in the future this is Genesis 1 26. we already went through this but in Genesis 2 7 where God created Men Out of the Dust and put that man from Genesis 1 East side of him that man which is the body amen that man is the one that will shout in the future eat of the fruit everybody okay so the original diet of a man is not stick everybody okay everybody okay the original diet of a man eats fruit everybody okay everybody okay everybody good so if a man is looking for fruit [Applause] are you up to date with the sermon if a man is looking for a fruit in a tree he is in the perfect will of God Amen let's go to mark 11. [Music] advise you many times when you listen to the sermon throughout the week go ahead and review it especially if you battle demon of sleeping amen amen Mark 11 verse 12. if you dare you can say Amen on the moral when the when they will come from Bethany brother clock I have the quote he was hungry remember the man that was in Genesis as a name him and his wife both of them have one name and they call him Adam and the Bible called Jesus the last Adam so Jesus going around he was hungry he didn't go to the restaurant look where he's going so when a man is looking for a fruit on a tree he is in the perfect will of God [Music] he is in the original will of God everybody okay he will help you in the future about the spoken word everybody okay and seeing a fig tree a pharaoh having leaves he came is happily I can't cross the description my friend he might find anything there on and when he came to it he found nothing by leaves for the time of fig was not yet so Jesus was looking for fruit according to the word of God he was perfectly back in Genesis amen this was not the Time of the Season right right do you think Jesus didn't know [Applause] Jesus was he was God do you think Jesus didn't know so how was Jesus looking for fruit in a place that fruit are not supposed to be there so where was Jesus where was his mind because in the Book of Revelation there is a tree of life he bring fruit every month you know that scripture right do you know that scripture the the tree of life doesn't have season every month it's bringing food so you can go in January you get fruit on February you go fruit but Jesus went and it was not the season that's right so where is the mind of Jesus everybody okay and Jesus answered and said to it no man eat fruit of you Hereafter forever and he disappointed water heard it why do you curse a tree that is not in the season and him being in the perfect will of God looking for fruit but the tree doesn't give him what he wants so Jesus activates something job 2 verse 19. and when the evening was come he went out of the city and in the morning brother Branham say around 11 o'clock I have a quote from 8 and 11. okay everybody okay as they pass by they saw the Fig Tree Jada from the root where life was hidden and Peter called to remember and say to him Master behold the Fig Tree which you curse is within the way and Jesus answering said to them have what faith in God for verily I say unto you that whatsoever you whatsoever shall say whosoever thank you shall say to this mountain so Jesus is bringing them to a different Realm of speaking things [Music] amen say to this mountain be the room be you remove and be cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he say shall come to pass so the mouth and the Heart must be in harmony I won't get to that today but I will show you how it works everybody okay whatever you say in your mouth and your heart must be in harmony if one is saying something else and the other one something else it won't happen we okay shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he says therefore I say to you whatsoever think you desire when you want to pray the first time Jesus didn't say prayer he says speaking and it happened the second time he included prayer so the third book got two ways he can work with our prayer [Music] did you see Joshua standing and praying to talk to the son so who told him to talk to the son and the son of babe did you see him saying guys keep fighting the enemy let me kneel down a little bit here and search for the Lord no problem therefore I say to you what things so ever desire when you believe that you received them and you shall have them so he works with our prayer and he works also with prayer because in the tenth Vision the top brother Branham enter into the secret chamber your father who sees you in prayer brother Branham said that was the third book are we okay let's go to Hebrew then we pray so we move from Genesis all the way to the second hand I'm looking for fruit and he didn't find fruit his book and when they say look at what is happening he say all that Hadith is based onto one thing faith amen let's go now Faith in prayer faith in a spoken word uh Hebrew chapter 11 verse 1. if you dare you can say Amen now Faith you understand this now is the substance of things hopeful now you know the difference we went through this the evidence of things not see you understand this everybody okay for buy it by faith the Elder obtained a good report through faith we understand that the world so Faith bring understanding or revelation this is not intellectual everybody okay that the world were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do what appear let me hold on to that job to verse uh five by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God has translated him watch this for before his translation in other words before God come and pick him up before his translation he has this testimony what is the testimony that he please look God what does pleasing God means verse six amen but without water faith it is how impossible to please who him so before Enoch who be taken up to the rapture he must have a faith that faith that please God in other words before the rapture about come on now everybody okay the brand must be in a state of a faith Jesus even said when the son of man shall come shall he fan Faith so you cannot God you will never go to the Rapture if you don't have faith you must be at a certain level to be picking up [Applause] God will not take you if you zero you must be already living in faith [Applause] for God to translate you everybody good everybody good listen to this before we pray the Bible says this we read it last week he said let the word of water my mouth and the meditation of what my heart be what acceptable in that water thy side acceptable means pleasing [Applause] yes sir but without faith it's impossible to do whatever please God so the word of your mouth must be the word of sex [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay David say the word of my mouth what come out of my mouth and what is coming from the heart amen both of these must be acceptable in either way they must be pleasing and to please God you must have water hey so the word that come out of your mouth must not be dry word that's why what you spoke to happen everybody okay you must speak with Resurrection so whatever you speak and whatever you meditate in your heart when we begin to bring Faith it is already pleasing to the Lord [Applause] everybody okay I will go slowly until even a baby in this church understand what I'm saying thank you Romans 10 verse 8 the Bible say the word is where each way even in thy mouth oh where in thy heart the word of water not just the word a word of faith it is a revealed world word [Music] don't worry my friend which we preach that if that shall confess with the mouth the Lord who Jesus and Shall Believe In The Water all right that God has raised him from the water and that shall be water so what comes in the mouth and the heart if they correct the result will happen as a team this is where we're heading John say for whatsoever is born of God how are you born of God Peter said being born again not by corruptible sin but by water Incorruptible by the water word of God which the water level and water or body the word of God which liveth is not the Bible the Bible is the letter they let they kill us but the one that by death and lives is a Living Word he described the logos You Are Born Again by the pillar of Fire [Music] [Applause] because it's incorruptible corruptable is our mother and our father but the word of God when we are born again we are born again from our spiritual father anything corruptable end up and John say who surveys born of God not of men of a chemist water the world so whatever is in the world if you are born again you can overcome it because in Genesis everything was under men [Applause] the three and the men The Lion and the man the elephant deficiency because God said dominate everything some do everything put it under control and who did that a Son of God because the Bible said Adam was a Son of God and if you are born of God because Adam was not only male he was man and water female so a Son of God here is also a woman and a man [Applause] is it a problem the Bible said God called them Adam [Applause] Adam was a name for the woman and the man [Applause] created man but he said the man there was a woman whoever is born of God may be a man or a woman but if you are born of God you overcome the world everybody they didn't say you overcome the tree of the world they didn't say you overcome the the uh water the animal of the world God put a package you overcome the world in other words the world and what is in the world and what is it under the world everything that is connected to the world I can overcome it so how do I overcome those things what do I use to overcome if I cannot if I need now I understand my position that who I am I cannot overcome the world if I touch this is this part of the world I can overcome it by my birth I can overcome it but how do I overcome it can I continue yes yes the Bible say whosoever is born of God or if they cometh water the world and this is the water victory that overcometh the water the world even our water faith so if there is a territory in this world that I have not overcome yet if I take Faith and I push it over there I will love it coming because the Bible says believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved you and who your house do you know what brother Branham say the same fact that you apply to yourself [Music] if you apply it to your children that faith will do the same thing [Applause] Jesus use it on the tree whoever is born of God will overcome the world how do you overcome the world you overcome the word by faith so if you use the faith and you put in everything that is in the world everything in the world must obey you that's why Jesus said if you speak to their Mountain the mountain is in the world but sometimes you can even stretch because Joshua stretch he spoke to the Moon Joshua went outside the Earth and spoke to the moon and to the Sun and they obey him under the Old Testament his stretched [Applause] oh [Applause] everybody don't care man let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly this morning Father once again thanking you for your grace for your love and your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father we are committing ourselves unto the hand may your spirit come and move me completely out of the way and may you come and teach us and speak to us and bless us and fill us and Deliver Us and heal us and affect every aspect of our life those that are here and those that are streaming and will be streaming later on in the name of Jesus Christ amen my subject this morning glory to God is the four phases of roof faith Victory to all Faith it's a victory to everything if you want to win everything use faith because Faith overcometh the world Faith even stretches because the universe belonged to my father brother Branham say God is the god of the universe and man was given the Earth but you can stretch it's still your father's property you're not trespassing even if you spoke to the Galaxy you're not trespassing it is your father property everybody okay everybody good everybody good we found out that before Enoch was taken out Enoch must have a certain condition for the Rapture if that condition is not met no rapture brother Branham say but look friend the time is coming that when there is rising up a water a church if we can have faithful Divine Healing [Music] how are we going to have faith for water the Rapture so before we get to rapturing Faith Divine Healing must be something common that's fine we got to move our train we got together this Earth old and water slow Church conditions that we are in in message churches [Applause] do what step out and do what launcher cut the water the shoreline and get out into somewhere where you lose all your senses of water fear and water doubt out there where our feets are what possible brother just as free as he can be [Applause] we wish too much the time of wishing is over I don't need to sit wishing wishing wishing wishing wishes doesn't accomplish nothing it is a time to believe [Applause] don't worry my friend we'll get there as we climbing I truly believe before the church can have the Rapture it's got to have water rapturing faith we can't even have faith for Divine Healing let alone water Rapture in faith you see what brother bottom is saying you got to have a faith that shall change and Quicken this body and be taken away I believe there is a church on its Road tonight a power of the Living God that man will do water [Music] speak the word hear and water there and he said a church is coming out not a psychologist not some disput on make-believe but a real true genuine anointed Holy Ghost caller church house amen so before we leave and go out of this word we must be at a certain level we cannot be operating under and expect the rapture because the Rapture is a high faith everybody okay everybody good glory be to God as we're traveling in the Tabernacle we're trying to get roof into a different Tabernacle we already establish that when you are born again it is only a beginning [Music] everybody okay when you're born again you just started so we start by the new birth amen and we are complete oh we end by the translation you understand what I mean by the rapture which is the body change everybody okay the new birth changed the inside the Rapture changed the outside everybody okay but before we are translated we must reach a certain state amen because this on you put you in but this one finishes but before there's a in between the starting and the finishing there is a journey [Music] amen and the new birth put you in sad crust which is their beloved that's why John say and now we're climbing that beloved I wish that there may prosper can you say Amen now you should be now chewing this building amen that you prosper and be in good health even as the salt water prosperity and we understand from last Sunday everything must Prosper together Everybody Must Go Together everybody must leave Egypt nothing stay behind not even a hoof every aspect of your life must prosper as your soul prosper some of you love sickness or love uh what certain condition I don't know but let's deal with this listen to this glory to God recently a man said to me say brother Branham I do not believe in Divine Healing can you continue brother Benjamin I said well it wasn't for you it was for believers continue my friend him that believeth that's who it's for it wasn't for unbelievers in the beginning I said so you shall never draw any dividend off of it so let's don't worry about it the man say I believe that sickness is a glory to God oh we usually don't say that in our mouth but with our action this is what we say [Applause] you never said it in your mouth but damning to you you already believe it that it's normal because all my family have blood pressure [Applause] can I continue and brother Branham said I said well it is strange you had your wife operated on for appendicitis you must it must have cut the glory out in other words if sickness is for the glory of God you should not go to the doctor because when you go to the doctor you are removing the glory of God [Applause] wants you to be poor right here don't go to work foreign because when you pay bill you are removing it you need to be behind bills can I continue can I continue and brother Branham said must have cut the glory out so people that talk like that there is water something wrong God don't get Glory out of people being what see when you are sick he doesn't glorify God don't even brag about it [Applause] you know so-and-so is suffering with this oh God no it doesn't glorify God he wants you to be how well our blessed Bible say above all that you prosper in what hell that is water the scripture so we can't deny that I'm ready you will swallow it if you are more blessed when you are dead and you can do more for the Lord when you are dead than when you are alive well go ahead and die I'm reading by the pranam am I reading a different can you verify I'm reading brother Branham go ahead and die and I'm gonna preach your funeral Mr humble Mr spiritual go ahead and die this is what brother Branham says do you see do you see brother Branham say but God wants you here to do it fulfill his program above all things I would you rather be in water that is water scripture above all things that you prosper in water hell the rather of the scripture inspired by who the Holy Spirit which the scriptures say all scripture is given by water inspiration so God wants you to prosper [Applause] and be in good health your sickness doesn't glorify God [Applause] the people see you going to church every day and you're the one suffering more than them is he glorifying God they said she goes to church she faster the time she's the one to have more problem than us [Applause] he doesn't glorify God it is not the glory of God God wants you to be happy [Applause] yeah amen glory to God we have sent you this court the scripture the Bible say Delight thyself also in the Lord and it shall give the water desire if you notice desire is not singular desire is plural we love to put it singularly the desire yes of that heart so if you want God to give you the desire you need to Delight on him first everybody okay everybody good so far and we found last week that Matthew said but seeking water the Water Kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be how added unto you what is the kingdom of God we always say what in the message we are big in terms that we don't even understand please seek ye first the kingdom of God somebody say okay let's go to church or let's do this what is the kingdom of God what does he mean the kingdom of God is what William Marion Branham hallelujah what is the kingdom of God brother Branham say God in the future home already took up his abode how potentially because the New Jerusalem have not come down yet so potentially God is on Earth normally God should come when the New Jerusalem come down he's preaching the future home and God get in the city and go live in his City but potentially God is already on Earth where is he brother Branham say the kingdom of God is in the earth now why in the hearts of his Saints [Applause] are we okay it is his attribute that he begin in the beginning now his attribute is what redeemed what what is he wedding to redeem the water the Earth to set his attribute on there to fulfill exactly the predestinated water so when the Holy Spirit come in your life he brings God inside of you [Applause] let's go my friend kingdom is not of this Earth God's kingdom is in our hearts it is a water spiritual Kingdom that we are born into it Jesus said the kingdom of God comes but not with value without Valance and the kingdom of God is how within you the whiter the Holy Spirit which is water God's kingdom moving in the water man and governing and controlling him that is the water the Kingdom so seek ye first the kingdom of God means the Holy Ghost when I get the Holy Ghost then everything will be water added unto me [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay once you get the Holy Ghost you need to go back to God you say the first step is already checked now I'm ready for the next step because the new birth put you in the start mode everybody good everybody good listen to what brother Branham say a glory to God he said but the kingdom of God is established where in the heart and the water soul of a man by water a revelation a revelation of Jesus Christ that's why brother Branham said the new birth is a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you he said Upon This Rock I shall build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail water against upon this water Revelation and to have a revelation you become a water believer and whatever believing this son shall follow them the water believe so first the kingdom must be establishing you amen when the kingdom is in you then everything else will be water that's why Jesus said if my word abide in you damn I you don't ask if he does anybody in you open John 15. I'm giving you the scripture so I can lock those devil out when they begin to talk to you a scripture pop-up a scripture pop-up if you dare you can say Amen John 15 verse 7 if you dare you can say Amen you there if you abide in me and my words the water abide in you and brother Branham say him and his word are one brother Brahman said you cannot have one without the other so if him abiding in you and his word him and his word are one it is the revealed word it is God the word that liveth and abide there forever it is a word that does have a beginning that's a heaven and it's a badder forever in the beginning was the word Christos Christ the logos if the word abide in you me in you the word in you amen so number one the word and he must be in you abiding how do they abide by the kingdom of God come into our life when the kingdom is already established in your heart then everything else above all now I want you to watch them now the kingdom must continue to extend you don't get in the promised land and you stay right there when you get in the promised land you start conquering that's why brother Branham say the promised land is the top of the holy spirit because it's fighting started you must fight for every entrance you must see which territory is not occupied yet and you need to attack and launch the attack in order to recuperate the territory that belongs to you because the film is still occupy You by birth now it's time for you to draft them out foreign [Applause] [Applause] and you can't function well in school they need to get up you must get possession of everything [Applause] everybody okay so far everybody good the Bible say if my word about you then do what ask what you because you already have the kingdom and and it shall be done to you herein is my father's house glorified so why are you asking you are glorifying God because your sickness doesn't glorify him but your headache don't glorify him no sir your depression doesn't glorify him it's bringing reproach ES [Applause] everybody okay that you bear much water fruit so you shall be how my disciples first the kingdom must be established when the kingdom are established seeking face the kingdom then what everything else must be what so when we receive the Holy Spirit I'm insisting it is only a starting point if you got the new birth praise the Lord you need to now investigate your life you need to perform an audit which area in my life is not functioning properly because God wants me to prosper [Applause] in every area which area is now receiving God the way it should be amen because Israel their clothing receives God their shoes receive God even their peace to a blessed no dog was Barren in Israel not even the rabbit was buried if you own a rabbit in Israel your rabbit is blessed if you only cut your cat is blessed everybody okay so far everybody okay so far so what is the advantage now I have given my life now we are in Christ amen now I'm in class what is the advantage brother Branham says this here hallelujah he said now friend let's hear him the holy spirit's picking in our midst but the mic has sent this quote he says showing diverse miracle and son and wonder let's just not pass over it as just common happening let's remember that it's Jesus the same yesterday today and how forever confirming his word we must do it oh please do it and take it listen carefully because we must seek him first back all up and we take off amen let every other things if somebody's sleeping check him when I say that he means somebody's doing that sex somebody who's sleeping everybody okay glory to God why the problem say not what men say what the Church Say by what God's will was oh we need to seek water the will of God not the favor of your neighbor not the faithful of your children not the favor of your husband or your wife but seek water the will of God and do that first then everything else the will of your wife the will of your children will do whatever for riding with it if you want your wife to do something go first seek God when you seek God everything else God will take care of him that ones that don't listen to you won't begin to listen to you the husband that is stubborn will begin to listen you mad God first [Applause] we try to please her husband going against the will of God your husband says stay home somebody stay home why are you home my husband said don't go to church yet amen amen continue to please your husband everybody okay why are you doing this because my wife is mad continue to please your wife if you want your children to fall in line you want everything to fall in line number one seek ye first mind God first if you man God first then automatically God is now responsible to look at your life and begin to correct everything in your life that is not in order let me continue my friend seek ye first the Water Kingdom of God have you ever witnessed that to be the truth Good Times you're not paying me [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you thank God everybody okay pray how first at the morning pray all through the day give God the first place in water everything then you won't be a water a witness amen amen we almost going give me a preacher give me a question give me a half a housewife that is how a Christian give me a farmer or a factory worker that will put God water first where in everything I shall show you a man will be housed successful in spite of all the devil can put water on him so he seek God's house first [Applause] let this law not the part of your mouth meditate upon a day and night so that you may prosper and have good success let's continue my friend we're getting there a little friend of mine has been a wonderful little doctor he believed in God but he just didn't want to accept him and last week week before last it is now he was led to Jesus Christ the man was not a Believer when brother Branham talked to him they led him to Jesus Christ what happened to that man he said his business and he and everything can we read together he was not a Believer now he's a Believer what is the consequences of him believing what is the benefit what is the result what is the dividend of you giving your life to Christ this man when he gave his life to Christ he said that his water business and water everything has water picked up already all right amen [Music] why is your business not picking up amen either you have not give God the first place oh you already gave God they pray the first place but the devil is robbing you with what they taught you before [Music] what they taught you before is blocking you from fighting the devil back because they taught you it's the will of God for you to remain that way but this man as he gave his life to the Lord Brother Branham say his business and everything begin to pick up what is affecting his life cannot continue brother Branham said he had not said nothing about it I say water don't worry it shall come water right along you just start trusting her God and watch how much more successful you are with your water patience put water God first pray before you go to the home [Applause] When I See This Emmanuel before you but I have a practice so to me what because I must be successful with my patient [Applause] my God must affect every area of my life [Applause] the god of spoken word Tabernacle must bless the song leader he must bless the musician amen he must bless the Deacon amen he must bless the trustee amen he must bless every member everybody [Applause] he's not a God that come and speak he only that's right amen every eye and this church must be blessed [Applause] if you come from under a poverty mind staying longer here just hang around if somebody's negative come hang around with me yes sir [Music] everybody okay when we give our heart Fest when we leave everything we have forsaken our friend we have forsaken our life we have given our lives to God after that what happened you ready you want to swallow what I give you are you going to swallow what I'm about to give you up in Matthew 19. I hope you're gonna swallow this yes open Matthew 19. that's why brother Branham keeps saying we are living below our privileges in other words the life we live is a life of mediocrity depth here depth here depth he Adept here it's annoying yes sir amen what will it do to you if that car payment is gone if you don't have a mortgage anymore how will you feel I know what I'm saying when I say that I tell the year I signed for 30 years continue 30 years me no no me I refuse it's an individual affair continue with your mortgage not me not because I'm a doctor because I have a big God [Applause] I need to be free everybody okay everybody okay I'm stretching you my friend [Applause] you're gonna swallow it you will swallow it let's go to Matthew 19. if you get you can say Amen verse 21 you there please follow me carefully make sure you got your Bible okay okay verse 21. Jesus said to him the Rich Young Ruler if you will be perfect hi everybody now is there yeah yeah yeah we will see now that's fine let me pull also what they give me last night when I saw it I stood up and I began to dance I'm chasing myself I say if my wife comes she sees me I say I'm just enjoying myself [Laughter] everybody okay he said if you will be perfect go and sell that you have and give to the poor and you shall have treasure in water heaven and come and do what follow me God gave this young man an opportunity he taught him I know everybody now is you just preach about we must Prosper now look at this stay up stay stay alert just follow me okay just follow me okay Jesus gave them an opportunity say hey whatever you have there take it away you come in water seek me first spoken word okay you ready but when the young man heard that saying he went away how sorrowful for he had water great possessions so this young man loved his possession more than Jesus Christ let's go slowly I know what you're fighting I know don't worry when I sit at home I can get your your vibration coming up and the Holy Spirit give me this is what you talk this is what you do when this one comes anabaddock when this one comes give this antibiotic so I know okay okay all right he says then said Jesus to his disciple verily I say to you that a rich man say amen amen shall hardly enter into the kingdom of water Heaven say amen amen you see how everybody say Amen because this one you want to believe this quickly yes the rich man ah so let me stay where I am so I can get in heaven you will be poor going to hell the problem is your heart you can be poor if you drinking and you're doing what is wrong you're going to have can I continue now let's talk a little bit here this young man Jesus asked him for something he loved please take your filter away let me preach and the young man when he looked at that he evaluated he looked at what he have he looked at Jesus Christ he said me losing all of this and following Jesus Christ he said no I can't do that this young man end up in hell can I continue the problem is that's where we stop let me go from before the foundation of the world H Jesus say father all that you have given me I have lost none acceptable one who the son of tradition the son of hell so Judah even though he had the ministry he came from hell Judah was unredeemable even if you take the Holy Ghost you put it in Judah the Holy Ghost will come out because there is nothing in Judah to receive to suck the Holy Ghost follow me carefully if this Rich Young Ruler went to hell it means that to begin with let's leave his money alone to begin with from the origin he was not a child of God do you follow me do you follow me it is not his ma his money that put him to hell it is the condition of his heart from the beginning he was not a child of God so no matter how much opportunity they will give it to him he will reject him I know you fighting me but let me help you out one day God asked Abraham Abraham waited and suffered 25 years to have one child when he has that child he loves Isaac everywhere I say give me mercy give me magic god look he said Abraham I need something from you Abraham said yeah I I have many goats there I have many sheep there I have many cows there God said that's not what I like I'm the one who's gonna tell you what I like Abraham said oh oh go ahead father my house you bless me so much go ahead God say look what you have behind it you mean God say yes Isaac you say Isaac you say give me Isaac did Abraham refuse why didn't Abraham refuse and why is the Rich Young Ruler refusing everybody okay everybody okay riches you can replace it but how are you going to replace a child [Applause] [Music] why is zebra come when they say give it Abraham that's a reason he said hey take it take what a child the only begotten if he had ten children you say yes I understand he got the only one why is Abraham yes and the Rich Young Ruler no which is they can take it away and give it back to you but if they take the child they kill him how are they going to bring him back to life so who has more faith why did abrahami works and they are the one who didn't work why why did it work and watch Abraham before Abraham gave Isaac Abraham say something are you following me I don't want you to miss what I'm about to deliver are you following me Abraham said God said give Isaac Abraham say Isaac he said no problem Abraham pick him up he said well he said where I show you well I have a GPS just follow Abraham said no problem let's go let's go Abraham reached there before he looked at the mountain he said over there God say over there that's where you kill him Abraham look he say you two wait me and DC Isaac here we are going they're going was to kill him but we will return [Applause] in other words Abraham knew that whatever he gives to God [Music] yeah he want music [Applause] because in heaven no more entity Abraham understood that he forgive it to him I'm not really losing anything it is the best insurance he's in good hand if I give him to God don't worry he means I will get it back do you follow me do you follow me Abraham knew that if I give you Isaac take it to begin with who gave it to me Isaac it's you so you want him take it bad and no I will get him back because there is a promise connected to this child everybody okay everybody good but the Rich Young Ruler refuse and God look he said it is difficult for rich people hold on righty I know what you're thinking where are we at we are in verse 19. Job to verse job to verse 24. and I and again I say to you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle then for a water a rich man to enter into the water the kingdom of God if we stop here I know what you're going to go home with it but let me help you you there when his disciple heard that follow me they were extremely exceedingly how amazing everybody say whoa I thought the disciple were poor why wait they're worrying about the Richer not getting to heaven the disciple were poor they already left everything but when Jesus is talking that it's hard for a rich man to get to heaven the disciples say whoa why are you worrying you don't have money you should be even happy Oh Praise the Lord we will not have money so we will be going to heaven the rich go into hell can I continue but when Jesus beheld they say who then can be saved why do they question the Salvation if they attack the rich why why watch verse 26 but Jesus beheld them and said to them with man it is how impossible but With God all things are how possible what seems to be hard for you it is not hard for God follow me carefully my friend because I'm gonna drop to the channel say to him behold we have water forsaken all and we have done water follow thee what shall we have therefore a rich young ruler came and came to God say I need eternal life God said you wanted in our life sell what you have follow me put me first before your money the rich man say no I cannot do that he turned his back Jesus said it is hard for the rich people to get in heaven the disciples say my God so who's going to go to heaven Jesus say hey if it's impossible to you God nothing is impossible in other words it's not your problem okay then Pete they say ah as a matter fact since you are born since you you're on that subject let me make my point this is Peter come on let me make my point ah we left everything [Music] let me have an interview with you we left everything I left my wife I left my mother I lost my job I was a fisherman I followed you me I did what the Rich Young Ruler didn't do what do I get am I reading a different Bible because I gave you the first place but what is the benefit you dummy give this first identity what is the benefit he's asking God himself [Music] in the face he said I followed you I did what you told me get baptized I get baptized get Justified that justify sanctify against Sanctified get the Holy Ghost I got the Holy Ghost now that I got the Holy Ghost what do I get [Applause] [Music] do you want me to continue do you want me to continue we need to know what do we get what is the advantage what is the package what is the package of your insurance U.S policy I need to know what is the package because we have forsaken all we have esteemed everything down and you the top what do we get do you follow me do you follow me do you follow me what is the answer of Jesus himself let me prepare my board oh my God you there my friend you there Shake somebody young people I don't know what you're doing at night wake up everybody okay if you're sleeping you go stand there the Deacon will keep you alive verse 28 are you there and Jesus say unto them

when God if he lost 500 God restore 500 plus 500. God restore 1000. because it's a 100 percent guarantee because job was sitting quiet it's God who were arguing with the Devil they just put job in the middle [Music] job said I'm suffering this because of you you the one that starts your argument with the devil it was not me so per consequences whatever job have a hundred percent the package is in the future and the package is a hundred percent when we look this package he said he shall so you also put that in the future let me hold on okay I'm not going to put it in the future yet okay let's hold on okay because when we say future we're looking at the New Jerusalem coming from Heaven that's okay let's go he said shall we see a hundredfold and shall inherit water everlasting life so the Holy Ghost is already guaranteed to you you already received a new birth in the future you got the position amen if you for second houses brother wife children whatever just know that I'm Gonna Give You Back a hundred percent in other words God pays back let's handle this now let's go to mark 10. and let's drop the antatomic bomb now we already understood this right let's go to mark 10. I'm good in time if you're there you can say Amen Mark 10 if you dare you can say Amen the same story remember in Matthew Jesus said it's hard for your what rich man a rich man the way we interpreted is somebody who has money so if you have money you have a hard time going to the heaven let's see what Jesus say okay okay are you with me according to Matthew if you have money you have a hard time going to heaven that's what he said right let's see what Jesus said marks chapter 10 if you dare you can say Amen job to verse 21. same story then Jesus beholding him love him and say one thing you lack go your way sell whatsoever you have and give to the poor and you shall have treasure in heaven and come take up your cross and do what follow me and he was sad at that same and went away grieved for he had water great possession not Abraham watch carefully you there and Jesus look around about and say to his disciple hardly shall dead I have riches enter into the kingdom of water God and the disciples were astonished at his word but Jesus answered again and said to them Jesus explained what he said in Matthew Matthew didn't give us this Matthew only said whoever have riches that's it but Mark said I'm a pastor I'm the ox of the team I'm gonna tell you something that Matthew forgot Matthew forgot the part that Jesus explained who's rich don't go to heaven okay everybody okay verse 24 and the disciple where astonished his word but Jesus answered again and say to them children my brother you there yes sir yes sir how hard it is for them that trust in water reaching not just riches now we clear now we clear say amen amen so the problem is not a rich man is a man that trusts riches am I reading a different Bible am I reading a different Bible the problem was not the richest it was trusting in the riches put the stop put your finger on your Bible like this go to First Timothy six we read it last week I have to go this way First Timothy chapter six if you're there you can say Amen remember the problem is the rich who does what trust in riches okay let's go to First Timothy chapter six we read it last week if you dare you can say amen amen let's go to verse 17. my brother full force let's go do you see that but in water the Living God who does what giveth us rich leaves enjoy everybody clear everybody clear let's go back to Mark now now Paul said you who are rich do not put your trust in the witches put your trust in God but that girl that I'm talking about give us richly everything to enjoy I don't know if you get what I'm saying everybody good so the problem with the Rich Young Ruler it is not riches Jesus explained that it is their trust in the riches instead of trusting in them God if he was the son of Abraham he would have understood that whatever I give away I will get it back [Applause] if I gave Isaac away I'm getting it back if whatever job was taken of God doubled everybody okay um verse 24 children how hard is he for them that trust in which is to enter into the kingdom of water it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than a rich man to enter into the kingdom of water heaven now let's drop to Peter drop to verse 28 to save time then Peter begin to say to him after that again remember we heard with Matthew right Peter say ah so he refused we didn't refuse what do we get verse 28 Peter begin to say to him law we have left out and have followed you Jesus answered and said follow me carefully now verily I say to you there is no man that have left water house or water Brethren or water sister oh what the or whatever mother or what why or what children all water land for water my sin and the water the gospel shall receive a water hundredfold now in water this time [Music] receive water houses and water bread and water and water and water children and water land push the brick what I'm trying to say is this because I want you to get me this is Jesus giving the promise that if you give me something and you put me first I must return a hundred percent what I'm trying to show you is whatever is in your life that is 30 percent of 40 percent of 15 you must go back to God and tell God you taught me not 15 percent not 30 percent that's not the contract [Applause] our contract whatever I give it to you 100 percent my children my business 100 my life 100 my marriage 100 my schooling 100 Everything
