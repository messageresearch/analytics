[43:57] let's keep it amen oh

[44:07] [Music]
[44:12] you
[44:19] justif oh
[44:21] you in
[44:24] the oh jusy
[44:31] [Music]
[44:33] justif you have it in the first place
[44:40] justif oh
[44:44] justify
[44:47] justif you have not done the place you
[44:54] [Applause]
[44:55] Justus amen
[44:57] you have not done it in the first place
[45:01] you are
[45:02] Justified amen if you have a hard time
[45:05] swallowing that you told him I did it
[45:07] ignorantly in unbelief so at that point
[45:11] your conscience will be calm because
[45:14] it's hard the brother brandham say God
[45:16] is the only one that can forgive and
[45:20] forget but human being you can forgive
[45:23] yourself but you won't forget so when
[45:26] they say you never done it in the first
[45:28] place it's hard for the human man to
[45:32] grasp the richness of the glory of God
[45:35] to understand that I never done it so
[45:38] God gave us a second thing through Paul
[45:40] I did it devil but I did it ignorantly
[45:44] in
[45:50] unbelief amen because there is a
[45:53] sacrifice of
[45:55] ignorance can you believe it
[45:57] amen amen is God unjust God forbid amen
[46:04] it is for the vessels of Mercy that have
[46:08] been predestinated to show the glory of
[46:11] God Amen when Judah does it it's not in
[46:15] ignorance it is counting unto Judah even
[46:19] if he take the money and pull it back
[46:20] it's not working when Esau goes back and
[46:23] then cry and repent it's not working but
[46:27] when Peter comes
[46:29] back it's a different story it looks
[46:32] like God overlooked the mistake of Peter
[46:36] amen because God has something special
[46:39] when it comes to the predestinated seed
[46:41] amen it is the sin of ignorance you did
[46:45] it ignorantly in unbelief that's why
[46:48] when you come back to your normal mind
[46:51] it is completely different I know you
[46:53] fighting with the thought that okay now
[46:56] we know that we justify but we still
[46:59] make mistake right don't worry my friend
[47:01] down the road I have like 80 something
[47:04] slide I mean the court or something so
[47:07] we are loaded so down the road we will
[47:10] deal with that how can you be justified
[47:13] never done it and still you fall on the
[47:15] on I mean under sin or you commit I mean
[47:18] you do something wrong what do you think
[47:19] about it what has God think about
[47:22] because that's what matter and you will
[47:24] see and it will free you completely and
[47:26] deliver you because these things are not
[47:29] been taught well and we struggle with
[47:31] the devil all the time beaing ourself
[47:35] some of us have a PhD in biding ourself
[47:38] amen I'm the bad one I did bad I I mean
[47:42] I don't deserve Mercy to begin with you
[47:44] don't deserve anything so it was the
[47:47] grace of God so when you say I don't
[47:49] deserve I don't deserve sometime what we
[47:51] mean is I wish I never done any sin so I
[47:55] can come to God
[47:57] and say I deserve
[47:59] it that's what we
[48:02] unconsciously are saying without saying
[48:06] it so you try to be over just it is the
[48:10] attribute that produ
[48:12] it in other word it's God that allow
[48:17] it so that God can show healing through
[48:22] you so that God can show his saving
[48:25] power through you how can God save you
[48:28] if there is nothing to save
[48:30] me how can you call him a
[48:32] savior so why do you blame
[48:36] yourself brother Bram say it's the
[48:38] attribute that produces it as hard as
[48:40] you think he's the one that created
[48:42] Lucifer what did he have in mind when he
[48:45] was creating Lucifer to bring Lucifer to
[48:48] worship Him Lucifer begin to worship but
[48:51] God knew exactly what Lucifer will do
[48:54] and if you notice at the beginning he
[48:55] worshiped yes he did then later on he
[48:57] turned into something else and Judah at
[49:00] the beginning was a disciple he preached
[49:02] the gospel he cast a devil but toward
[49:04] the end he shows something what do you
[49:06] think Jesus was piing when he was
[49:08] picking Judah was he looking at Judah
[49:11] preaching the gospel only no no he knew
[49:13] that the atonement must be killed and
[49:16] need somebody not from Heaven from
[49:20] Hell because he was called the son of
[49:23] ption so he came from hell it's God that
[49:26] picked somebody from
[49:28] here and put him among the disciple to
[49:32] fulfill his
[49:35] work this is this is not uh
[49:40] Pentecostal uh teaching these are
[49:43] message pure word Brad that open up your
[49:47] eyes and you will bless God every day of
[49:50] your life amen because if you were not
[49:53] predestinated no matter what you do you
[49:55] are going no
[49:57] amen but God chose you before the
[50:00] foundation of the world and he put you
[50:03] in the Lamb's Book of Life and then kill
[50:05] the lamb knowing that somewhere down the
[50:08] road I know they're going to mess up
[50:10] that's why he say you are God don't
[50:12] forget that but just know that you're
[50:13] going to fall like men amen I'm already
[50:17] in other word I'm already aware of what
[50:20] is coming in your life so when you
[50:22] coming back home don't think you are the
[50:24] one informing me oh Lord I did a 100 Sin
[50:28] Sin number one what do you think God was
[50:31] when you were doing
[50:33] that God already knows everything amen
[50:37] amen that's why he summarized everything
[50:40] in unbelief because sometime you won't
[50:43] remember everything in detail that you
[50:46] did from the time you were born all the
[50:48] way now if not everybody will stay on
[50:50] the Altar for three five days sitting uh
[50:53] s number uh 1,35
[50:57] see number 4 4,000 I
[51:01] mean I mean how are you going to
[51:03] remember all of that so God help you and
[51:06] put everything up he said whether you
[51:08] remember it or not whatever you remember
[51:11] just put it and say I'm a sinner when
[51:14] you say I'm a sinner so we know exactly
[51:17] everything that follow up is connected
[51:19] to a sinner so when you ask forgiveness
[51:21] as a sinner it cuts everything away so
[51:24] when you chop sinner it chop Sinner and
[51:27] every attribute that is connected with
[51:30] sinner is chopped away so you don't have
[51:32] to go into the
[51:37] [Applause]
[51:40] detail if I say what I want to say you
[51:42] will shock some of you so I bet I better
[51:45] just avoid
[51:47] right the problem is when I say I'm the
[51:49] one on the camera are we together are we
[51:53] together that's why a true head
[51:58] a true head a true husband will not sit
[52:02] and wait for his wife to give all the
[52:07] [Music]
[52:12] detail the wife need to
[52:15] confess but a true husband will sit and
[52:18] say that's it I already know you messed
[52:21] up put it down let's move on I don't
[52:24] need for you to tell me number one one
[52:27] number two number three number four
[52:30] number five what do you think do you
[52:33] love
[52:34] [Applause]
[52:36] me there is a way to summarize all of
[52:39] that into one
[52:43] thing she already have a
[52:46] baby what do you
[52:53] want that's a Silence of the seven SE
[52:56] yes
[52:58] sir did you get what I say did you get
[53:01] what I say God look at one thing you did
[53:05] all of this because you were a sinner
[53:08] that's why brother Bram say sin is not
[53:11] uh stealing it's not this is this
[53:13] brother say sin is
[53:17] unbelief I'm an unbeliever no wonder you
[53:20] cheating no wonder you lying no wonder
[53:22] you doing all of the so should we stay
[53:24] here like a Catholic where you go to the
[53:26] Catholic have you been in a Catholic
[53:28] Church some of you are born in a message
[53:30] praise the Lord thank God don't even try
[53:32] to go look it up but we were there you
[53:34] go sit the priest is sitting in a little
[53:37] chamber and you sit there and you begin
[53:39] to say everything that you did I did
[53:41] this I did this and the priest say go
[53:43] ahead and do hell Mary 20 times and do
[53:45] this and you go ahead and you go hell
[53:47] Mary blah blah blah and then you go back
[53:49] you think you you are
[53:56] [Laughter]
[53:58] I will tell the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[54:01] amen he saw Mary
[54:05] Magdalene I don't know who's pulling
[54:07] this whether it's online or it's here
[54:10] because it's a convention so let me
[54:11] speak it's a convention it's not your
[54:14] normal regular service this is a
[54:16] convention amen Mary Magdalene came I'm
[54:20] going to ask you a question when did she
[54:23] pray
[54:28] I'm asking you a question when did Mary
[54:33] Pray when did she pray did you see her
[54:36] coming and say Lord Jesus oh Father
[54:39] you're the god of Heaven you're the
[54:41] creator of Heaven and Earth what did she
[54:43] do she just did what she did did she
[54:47] open up her
[54:49] mouth the Bible say out of her came
[54:53] seven unclean Seven Devils and brother
[54:56] Bram is the only one that gave us all
[54:59] description of Seven
[55:02] Devils so where did Mary sit down and
[55:05] say Jesus I have seven devil devil
[55:08] number one is this number two is this
[55:10] number three is this because it was
[55:12] those devil that made her what she was
[55:15] what when did she pray I'm just asking
[55:17] you a
[55:19] question so what is
[55:24] prayer what is really prayer
[55:26] pray because Jesus was sitting there
[55:30] leaving her doing everything then he
[55:32] turned around to the accuser because he
[55:35] need to dismiss the case first before he
[55:38] justify just like the woman that was
[55:40] caught in adultery he need to dismiss
[55:42] the accusers first before he get there
[55:44] amen so what do you think we can
[55:47] do amen what do you think he's going to
[55:50] do he just sat there when he finished he
[55:52] said
[55:54] woman you sins that
[55:58] are your sins that are what how did
[56:02] Jesus know that he was
[56:04] many how did he know he was many he met
[56:07] Mary Magdalene the first day but he knew
[56:10] that her sins were many everybody that
[56:13] was there knew her they have vide tape
[56:16] and uh iPad and and record from uh I
[56:19] mean they they kind of downloaded all
[56:22] her pictures and everything Jesus didn't
[56:24] need all of that he said your sins are
[56:28] many are
[56:32] what based on which
[56:35] prayer the atonement is
[56:38] powerful my brother the atonement is
[56:42] powerful message believer clean up your
[56:45] mind on atonment it's a very powerful
[56:49] thing amen the atonement put you on a
[56:53] high level like you never done anything
[56:56] and it's the atonement that bring you
[56:58] back to your state of

[1:05:17] and I look at Christians today and I and
[1:05:20] I one thing I don't like to see is is
[1:05:24] brothers and sisters and Christian in

[1:05:29] when I see this you know in the church
[1:05:31] outside of church and and and and we
[1:05:33] have this word and and and and we I see
[1:05:37] that we in bondage a lot of times and
[1:05:39] and I think I was like why are Christian
[1:05:42] Believers in
[1:05:44] bondage and and and and second
[1:05:46] Corinthians came to my to my mind and
[1:05:49] and I was like we we going to expose the
[1:05:52] devil tonight that's right everything
[1:05:54] that he ever did and everything that he
[1:05:56] trying to do we're going to put them on
[1:05:57] blast tonight for the for the word says
[1:06:01] for though we walk in the flesh we do
[1:06:04] not war after the flesh that's right for
[1:06:08] the weapons of our Warfare are not
[1:06:11] cornal so basically the word is saying
[1:06:14] the weapons that we fight with are not
[1:06:16] cornal that's right this this war is not
[1:06:19] a cornal war no sir it's a spiritual war
[1:06:22] that's right and you cannot fight this
[1:06:23] war with a corner mind no sir
[1:06:26] Hallelujah and it's saying it's But
[1:06:28] Mighty through God to the pulling down
[1:06:30] the stronghold that's so whatever these
[1:06:33] spiritual whatever these spiritual
[1:06:35] weapons are they're
[1:06:37] Mighty so the word is telling me
[1:06:39] whatever these weapons are that I have
[1:06:40] in my possession sir they're in my
[1:06:43] possession as a Believer they are
[1:06:45] powerful enough to bring these
[1:06:46] strongholds
[1:06:48] down not only way I can get in trouble
[1:06:50] if I don't use
[1:06:52] them so it's there there are through the
[1:06:56] pulling down of
[1:06:57] strongholds casting down
[1:07:01] imaginations so that tells you right
[1:07:03] there there there's going to be some
[1:07:04] imaginations going on and and and these
[1:07:07] imaginations is Imagination that you
[1:07:09] don't have nothing to do with and we we
[1:07:11] going to get in that in a little
[1:07:14] bit and every High thing that exalted
[1:07:17] itself against the knowledge of
[1:07:19] God now a Believer is is not going to
[1:07:23] exalt himself against the knowledge of
[1:07:25] God
[1:07:26] so this word is saying every High thing
[1:07:28] that exalteth itself against God I don't
[1:07:30] I only know one person that's right that
[1:07:32] tries to exalt himself higher than God
[1:07:36] so so so we already know where these
[1:07:38] imaginations are coming from and we
[1:07:40] already know what these thoughts are
[1:07:42] coming from but the word says the power
[1:07:45] that we have is able to bring these
[1:07:47] thoughts into captivity every thought to
[1:07:50] The Obedience of
[1:07:52] Christ so so whatever it is that we need
[1:07:55] we already got it on the inside so we
[1:07:58] just got to use it that's right so so my
[1:08:01] question to you tonight what what is a
[1:08:03] gr
[1:08:06] hole what is a
[1:08:09] stronghold one definition says it's a
[1:08:12] place that has been fortified so as to
[1:08:16] protect right it against an ATT type
[1:08:20] right and on a and on a spiritual note
[1:08:22] it's a place where particular cause or
[1:08:25] belief is strongly defended or upheld
[1:08:29] take your time take your time now we we
[1:08:32] don't necessarily want to deal on the
[1:08:33] natural strongholds ton now we we going
[1:08:36] to focus on the spiritual
[1:08:38] side now a stronghold has two
[1:08:42] functions it's used to keep things
[1:08:44] out and it's used to keep things
[1:08:48] in a stron ho has two
[1:08:51] functions it's used to keep things out
[1:08:55] and it's chose to keep things in and
[1:08:58] what God wants us to be is behind the
[1:09:00] stronghold of his
[1:09:02] word his word is a stronghold for every
[1:09:05] believer yes sir and back in the
[1:09:08] biblical days um on the natural
[1:09:10] standpoint you know they would you know
[1:09:12] they would use uh big tall walls for
[1:09:15] Protections in the in the natural they
[1:09:17] they would surround their buildings with
[1:09:19] big tall walls that for protection but
[1:09:23] those walls were protections from the
[1:09:25] enemy
[1:09:27] but if you think about it if though if
[1:09:30] the enemy was to get inside those
[1:09:33] walls that same stronghold become
[1:09:35] protection for that
[1:09:37] enemy so but the but the good note on
[1:09:40] the spiritual side is that Satan can't
[1:09:42] get in he's got to find some kind of way
[1:09:45] to get you
[1:09:47] out he cannot cross the word of God so
[1:09:50] his his tactic is to find a way to pull
[1:09:52] you out from behind the word so that he
[1:09:55] can get you the reason with the word of
[1:10:04] God now a spiritual stronghold is a
[1:10:07] mental or emotional space controlled by
[1:10:10] a spiritual enemy and he uses it as a
[1:10:14] stationary to wage war against God
[1:10:18] that's right in the mind in mind battles
[1:10:22] this is the place where he uses to wage
[1:10:23] war against God so he can't pass the
[1:10:26] word so if he can get you out and get
[1:10:28] you to reason with What God Says then he
[1:10:30] got something to work with that's right
[1:10:32] he got something to work with yes sir in
[1:10:35] the message the greatest battle ever
[1:10:37] fought yes sir in
[1:10:39] 62 he said that but B say there's your
[1:10:43] Battleground your Battleground is back
[1:10:45] here at the beginning right back here in
[1:10:48] the
[1:10:49] soul back in your mind that opens the
[1:10:52] mind is the gate to the soul that's
[1:10:54] right the gate to the spirit rather your
[1:10:57] mind opens up and accepts the spirit or
[1:11:02] it rejects the spirit that's right you
[1:11:04] can have a little conscious
[1:11:06] Consciousness and little feelings right
[1:11:09] and little Sensations right all these
[1:11:11] things that has nothing to do with it
[1:11:15] that's just little Sensations and things
[1:11:17] right but when it comes to the reality
[1:11:20] your mind opens it up your mind either
[1:11:23] accepts it or rejects it that's right
[1:11:26] that's it friends God let none of them
[1:11:28] miss it see if your mind that opens up
[1:11:31] the door or closes the door that's right
[1:11:34] it listens to your conscience listen to
[1:11:36] your memory listen to your affections
[1:11:39] but when your mind close itself to those
[1:11:41] things and let God the spirit of his
[1:11:44] word come in yes sir it blows the rest
[1:11:47] of that stuff out that's right every
[1:11:49] doubt is gone every fear is gone every
[1:11:53] sensation of Doubt is gone every feeling
[1:11:55] is gone there's nothing standing there
[1:11:57] but the word of God and Satan cannot
[1:12:01] battle against that no sir he cannot
[1:12:04] battle against it now we know that's
[1:12:06] true yes sir these battles has raged
[1:12:08] since the day of the Garden of
[1:12:11] Eden the battle in the human mind Satan
[1:12:14] started it what did he do when he met
[1:12:17] Eve he didn't deny God's word but he
[1:12:21] whitewashed
[1:12:22] it he stopped up some little channels
[1:12:24] here somewhere he said but surely God
[1:12:28] Genesis 3:1 see surely God all things
[1:12:31] that he promised he know the word was
[1:12:33] right but he know he couldn't just come
[1:12:36] right out and blast it out BL like that
[1:12:38] but he sugarcoated it that's
[1:12:43] right let's turn let's turn to Genesis 3
[1:12:46] and let's take a look at that
[1:12:55] amen see I'm I'm I'm just tired of him
[1:12:58] Whispering the enemy whispering things
[1:13:01] that God didn't
[1:13:04] say that God didn't
[1:13:08] say now chapter three
[1:13:14] sir verse one Genesis 3 verse
[1:13:18] one it says now the serpent was more
[1:13:21] subtle right than any beast of the field
[1:13:24] right which the Lord God had made and he
[1:13:28] said unto the woman yay have God
[1:13:31] said you should not eat of every tree of
[1:13:34] the
[1:13:35] garden now see that was a sarcastic
[1:13:37] statement right
[1:13:40] there now he he know that's not what he
[1:13:43] told
[1:13:45] him see see see how he came around the
[1:13:49] word he he know that's not what he told
[1:13:51] her so so what he did he he he threw a
[1:13:54] jail
[1:13:56] better did did he not did did he say
[1:13:59] thou shall not eat of every tree of the
[1:14:00] garden now Eve going Eve going to
[1:14:03] correct him this time
[1:14:05] that's brother and the woman said unto
[1:14:08] the serpent no no no no no that ain't
[1:14:10] what he said we may eat of the fruit of
[1:14:12] the Trees of the garden we can do that
[1:14:15] but of the fruit of the tree which is in
[1:14:17] the midst of the garden God has said You
[1:14:19] shall not eat of it neither shall you
[1:14:22] touch it lest you die that's now verse
[1:14:25] three 2 and three Eve basically was
[1:14:27] telling the serpent that God didn't say
[1:14:29] that that that's exactly what she told
[1:14:31] him God didn't say that and that's how
[1:14:33] you got to do when the devil come
[1:14:35] telling you something that the word
[1:14:37] didn't say you just got to look him in
[1:14:38] the face say God didn't say that the
[1:14:41] word didn't say that the word didn't say
[1:14:44] it didn't say that there's no scripture
[1:14:46] in the Bible that say we're entitled to
[1:14:50] diabetes there's no scripture in the
[1:14:52] Bible that say we entitled to high blood
[1:14:55] person there's no scripture in the Bible
[1:14:57] that say that we're not we can't make
[1:15:00] it but God say we are
[1:15:02] healed we are healed by his scripes and
[1:15:06] that's the word you got to hold on
[1:15:09] to he's not going to tell you you heal
[1:15:12] he's going to give you any other reason
[1:15:13] to believe that you heal but you got to
[1:15:15] tell the devil God didn't say that
[1:15:18] that's not what the word say
[1:15:23] [Applause]
[1:15:28] verse
[1:15:30] [Music]
[1:15:32] three she says verse three but of the
[1:15:36] fruit of the tree which is in the midst
[1:15:37] of the garden God has said You shall not
[1:15:40] eat of it neither shall you touch it
[1:15:42] lest you
[1:15:43] die and the serpent said unto the woman
[1:15:46] you shall not surely
[1:15:48] die see he didn't he didn't get in with
[1:15:50] the first jail so so here he coming he
[1:15:53] coming around the other way come around
[1:15:55] another
[1:15:56] way he said You shall not surely die now
[1:16:00] if that's not the opposite of the
[1:16:03] word he he can't he can't get behind the
[1:16:05] word he can't change it so all he can do
[1:16:08] is take the word and flip it the
[1:16:11] opposite
[1:16:13] way for God do know that in the day you
[1:16:16] eat thereof then your eyes shall be open
[1:16:18] and you shall be as Gods knowing good
[1:16:20] and
[1:16:23] evil wow
[1:16:34] Proverbs 25:28 says he that have no rule
[1:16:37] over his own Spirit right is like a city
[1:16:39] that is broken down that's it and
[1:16:42] without walls
[1:16:43] amen and so basically if if you're not
[1:16:47] behind the protection of the
[1:16:50] word any and everything is able to get
[1:16:53] in and out of your spirit
[1:16:56] any and everything is able to travel
[1:16:58] inside and outside of your spirit so if
[1:17:01] the devil can get you to realize or
[1:17:03] Reason with the word of God if if you if
[1:17:06] he can get you to realize that you're
[1:17:09] not
[1:17:12] healed he got something to work
[1:17:15] on and and and he come in all kind of
[1:17:18] tightness and he he look at you and and
[1:17:20] and the doctor might tell you oh you oh
[1:17:22] you got cancer come on
[1:17:26] the doctor might tell you you got
[1:17:27] cancer but the word of God told me I was
[1:17:30] healed by a
[1:17:31] scraps and and he going to come to you
[1:17:33] and say oh you know you're losing a
[1:17:36] little weight don't don't you see
[1:17:38] that but you got to stay focused on the
[1:17:41] word I I I don't care about the
[1:17:45] circumstances I don't care how many
[1:17:47] tests I got to go through I don't care
[1:17:49] how many trials I got to go through I
[1:17:52] got my eyes focused on the rapture
[1:17:54] [Applause]
[1:17:56] he told me it was going to be a Rapture
[1:17:57] and I believe
[1:17:59] it I'm I'm not overwhelmed with the
[1:18:01] testes I got to go through to get to the
[1:18:03] Rapture that's going to be many tests
[1:18:06] but if he can get me to stop dropping
[1:18:08] pay attention to every little thing that
[1:18:09] it do then I take my mind off the
[1:18:11] Rapture now he got me then he'll talk me
[1:18:13] out of the Rapture but I know there's
[1:18:15] going to be a Rapture I don't care how
[1:18:17] many testes you bring my
[1:18:19] way I don't care how many times you
[1:18:22] tripped me up there's going to be a
[1:18:24] rapture and I'm going to stay
[1:18:27] [Applause]
[1:18:32] focused am Ephesians 2 and 2 says when
[1:18:35] in time pass yes sir you walk according
[1:18:38] to the course of this world that's right
[1:18:41] according to the prince of the power of
[1:18:42] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[1:18:46] the children of Disobedience yes sir so
[1:18:49] so this this is who we Waring against
[1:18:51] you know Satan and and his angels his
[1:18:53] fallen angels
[1:18:55] and and like I said when you behind the
[1:18:58] protection of the word he can't get to
[1:19:00] you and and and and and the bride of
[1:19:03] Christ should be so fortified behind the
[1:19:05] word so so he can't get way in I mean I
[1:19:08] mean he should thus say the Lord should
[1:19:10] be all around you you got to get to a
[1:19:13] place when Satan comes up to you he runs
[1:19:14] into dust says the Lord you see what I'm
[1:19:16] saying and then and then when he come
[1:19:18] from another way he running the dust say
[1:19:20] the Lord he can't get in so whatever way
[1:19:23] he come tired of get to you he need to
[1:19:24] run in the dust sayth the Lord you need
[1:19:26] to be fortified behind the word don't
[1:19:29] reason with the word don't reason with
[1:19:32] the
[1:19:33] word and and the and the Bride is a word
[1:19:37] bride and we have a word Prophet so so
[1:19:40] so this is all we
[1:19:42] have so in Ephesians 6 verse 10 it say
[1:19:47] finally my brethren sir be strong in the
[1:19:50] Lord that's right in the power of His
[1:19:53] might that's right put on the whole arm
[1:19:55] of God that you may be able to stand
[1:20:00] against the Ws of the devil that's right
[1:20:02] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:20:04] blood but against
[1:20:06] principalities against Powers against
[1:20:09] the rulers of Darkness of this world
[1:20:12] against spiritual wickedness in high
[1:20:14] places wherefore take unto you the whole
[1:20:17] armor of God that you may a be able to
[1:20:19] withstand the evil of the devil and heav
[1:20:22] doing all to stand am now how how can
[1:20:27] you put on the whole arm of
[1:20:30] God I'm ask you a question how can you
[1:20:32] put on the whole arm of
[1:20:37] God by believing Every
[1:20:43] Word by believeing every
[1:20:45] word that's in this
[1:20:49] Bible when you deny one part of this
[1:20:52] Bible you missing a piece of your armor
[1:21:00] in the message who is
[1:21:02] God yes
[1:21:04] sir this is in 1950 paragraph 12 said
[1:21:09] well I'm afraid that the church doesn't
[1:21:11] know their
[1:21:13] Authority I'm afraid that the Holy Ghost
[1:21:15] born men doesn't realize their
[1:21:17] Authority where of the authority that
[1:21:19] God has permitted to his church on I
[1:21:22] give unto the the key to the
[1:21:25] kingdom whatever you bind on Earth will
[1:21:29] be bound in heaven whatever you loose
[1:21:32] will be loosed I give you power over
[1:21:36] serpents and over all kinds of
[1:21:40] diseases yes sir so he's telling me I
[1:21:43] got that power
[1:21:45] right not just me but you got that power
[1:21:49] so why would you accept anything from
[1:21:52] the devil when you got that power
[1:21:56] you got the answer to his to his lies
[1:21:59] you got the
[1:22:00] answer he give you he give you power
[1:22:03] over all kinds of diseases yes sir oh
[1:22:06] everything and nothing shall harn you
[1:22:09] exercise your faith Let it Loose let God
[1:22:12] have his way God will grant it to you
[1:22:16] and he said exercise your faith but you
[1:22:17] got to put it in action that's right you
[1:22:20] got to put that power in action that's
[1:22:22] right you can't just read it in the
[1:22:23] Bible you got to speak it to the devil
[1:22:26] he he know the word he see the word but
[1:22:28] he just can't live it but you got you
[1:22:30] got to put it back in his
[1:22:32] face Matthew 16 Matthew chapter 16 verse
[1:22:38] 19 and I wish I had it up there so you
[1:22:41] can read it
[1:22:43] so they put it up
[1:22:47] okay you got to say
[1:22:52] amen and I will give unto thee the keys
[1:22:54] of the Kingdom of Heaven yes sir
[1:22:56] whatsoever thou sh bound on Earth shall
[1:22:57] be bound in heaven that's right and
[1:22:59] whatsoever thou shall loose on Earth
[1:23:01] shall be loosed in heaven so the so the
[1:23:02] so the prophet right in line with the
[1:23:04] scriptures yes sir so he he describing
[1:23:07] you telling you what you can do with
[1:23:08] this power so my my thoughts tonight is
[1:23:12] that every every child of God will be
[1:23:14] free tonight that that's that's my
[1:23:16] prayer tonight that anybody that's bound
[1:23:18] that can be free tonight you you need to
[1:23:21] know where your battle coming from you
[1:23:23] need to know how to fight
[1:23:25] you need to know how he how he attacks
[1:23:26] you you need to know how to
[1:23:38] counteract hallu now let's look at this
[1:23:41] message the conflict between God and
[1:23:45] Satan paragraph
[1:23:49] 29 it says Eve got from behind it and
[1:23:53] lost the battle right as soon as Eve
[1:23:56] Satan was standing out there shooting
[1:23:58] his
[1:23:59] targets she said but the Lord said and
[1:24:02] then he shot
[1:24:04] again she said but the Lord say so then
[1:24:07] he shot again another way but the Lord
[1:24:10] said but Satan raised up back there said
[1:24:13] but wait just a minute if the Lord did
[1:24:16] say that let me just tell you something
[1:24:19] you see you're not wise like God you
[1:24:22] don't know right from wrong
[1:24:24] but if listen wouldn't you love to be
[1:24:26] wise like
[1:24:28] God see she see she shot him down with
[1:24:31] every Avenue that he came in so so he
[1:24:35] he's he's very
[1:24:36] cunning he's very cunning so so he he's
[1:24:39] not going to stop until he find a way to
[1:24:41] get
[1:24:42] in so so like I said you need to make
[1:24:44] sure that you you don't have no way for
[1:24:46] him to get in and and only way you can
[1:24:48] do that is surround yourself by the
[1:24:50] [Applause]
[1:24:52] word and the prophet says why Eve said
[1:24:55] yes I believe I
[1:24:57] would maybe something like that I
[1:24:59] believe I would like to just know all
[1:25:01] the wisdom of God I like to know what's
[1:25:04] right and wrong I don't know it well
[1:25:07] tell I'll tell you this say say I'll
[1:25:09] tell you now she said but the Lord said
[1:25:12] oh but surely you know he's a good God
[1:25:14] he won't do that see right there she
[1:25:17] broke the hole through so he could shoot
[1:25:20] right there she made the wrong stop
[1:25:22] right there yeah see she opened up she
[1:25:26] opened up she opened up a space for him
[1:25:28] to shoot
[1:25:29] in she opened up a space and and what
[1:25:32] she did she went against what the word
[1:25:35] said so when she went against what the
[1:25:37] word that become that become a gap in
[1:25:41] her protection see the word was her
[1:25:43] stronghold but the minute that she
[1:25:45] turned down one portion of the word it
[1:25:47] opened up a gap of her protection now
[1:25:49] the enemy can get in that's right and
[1:25:52] and what he do he pulls her out yeah
[1:25:55] when she when she begin to un disbelieve
[1:25:57] what the word say he pulls her out and
[1:25:59] he begin to develop strongholds in their
[1:26:01] mind now she got a stronghold between
[1:26:04] her and the word of God so then now she
[1:26:08] become a protection place for that
[1:26:11] [Applause]
[1:26:14] Spirit when when you allow the devil to
[1:26:17] talk you out of what God
[1:26:21] Said you become protection for that
[1:26:26] Spirit now instead of the word of God
[1:26:29] being a being a stronghold for you now
[1:26:31] you a stronghold for that
[1:26:34] [Applause]
[1:26:37] spirit and that's what Satan want he
[1:26:39] want rest he want to place the rest and
[1:26:41] when you let him in you is his
[1:26:44] protection the only way you can break
[1:26:46] that is to get back in line get back
[1:26:49] behind the word of God
[1:26:55] the only good thing about it if you
[1:26:59] allow Satan to do that if if he can
[1:27:01] treat you into taking something that God
[1:27:04] a said you can always give it
[1:27:07] [Applause]
[1:27:09] back you can always give it back there
[1:27:12] there's no respiration period you you
[1:27:15] you know you go to the store and buy
[1:27:16] something they tell you you got 90 days
[1:27:18] to exchange it no you can always give
[1:27:21] the devil his you can always give it
[1:27:23] back to him
[1:27:25] there's no time limit on it whenever you
[1:27:27] can come to
[1:27:29] yourself however long that take when you
[1:27:32] come back to
[1:27:34] yourself all you got to do is say I'm
[1:27:36] sorry devil you can have this back this
[1:27:37] is not what God
[1:27:40] said this is not what he
[1:27:44] said we we we didn't say that he won't
[1:27:47] use you or he won't get to you sometime
[1:27:49] but sometimes some somewhere down the
[1:27:51] road a Believer is going to wake up
[1:27:55] somewhere down the line a Believers
[1:27:57] going to wake up and and and they going
[1:27:59] to say you know what God didn't say this
[1:28:03] he didn't say that wh why am I worrying
[1:28:05] about things when he told me he won't
[1:28:07] put no more on me than I can bear and
[1:28:09] you know and then the scripture start
[1:28:11] coming back in our mind why why I
[1:28:14] worrying about if I'm going to make it
[1:28:15] and he told me I already made it you
[1:28:17] know when you and you start playing the
[1:28:19] scriptures in your mind why why am I
[1:28:21] worrying about sicknesses and he already
[1:28:22] told me I'm Healed
[1:28:24] a Believer going to kick soon or lat
[1:28:26] it's going to kick
[1:28:28] in and when it kick in you just politely
[1:28:31] hand it back to
[1:28:33] him as they say the game is

[1:28:59] something to you Christians down here
[1:29:01] don't you never stop one second for the
[1:29:06] devil don't stop to reason it out when
[1:29:09] you start to reason it the Devil comes
[1:29:11] right in and see that's what he wants
[1:29:13] you to do reason he want you to find
[1:29:16] some kind of way to to say that God
[1:29:18] didn't mean what he said no God meant
[1:29:20] what he
[1:29:22] said you cannot you cannot reason God
[1:29:26] you cannot understand God you got to
[1:29:29] just believe God see that's it I can't
[1:29:32] explain God nobody can I can't explain
[1:29:36] many things but the only thing I just
[1:29:38] believe it because he say so now there's
[1:29:42] none of us can explain it don't try to
[1:29:44] explain it don't get with these
[1:29:46] unbelievers that say well now look your

[1:30:39] Christ lives in me and and and and he
[1:30:42] fights with that the most he he do he do
[1:30:45] not want you to realize who's walking on
[1:30:48] the inside of you so he will make you
[1:30:50] reason all the time about who's walking
[1:30:53] inside of you
[1:30:54] because he have you looking at the
[1:30:55] corner man he would constantly Focus you
[1:30:58] on the corner man but you you got to
[1:31:00] catch the
[1:31:01] [Applause]
[1:31:08] Revelation
[1:31:09] hallu putting on the whole arm of God
[1:31:12] yes
[1:31:13] sir it's
[1:31:17] 1962 paragraph 29 say now we found out
[1:31:20] that God gave his children the best yes
[1:31:23] my brother and therefore he don't have
[1:31:25] to improve
[1:31:28] it he just he never changes he hasn't
[1:31:32] changed one bit since the first time he
[1:31:34] gave for his children protection now
[1:31:37] when he knew there's war in heaven he
[1:31:40] had to kick out Satan right then he came
[1:31:43] down on Earth and fortified his children
[1:31:45] with his word yes my brother so you see
[1:31:47] your protection word god came down here
[1:31:50] to fortify you with the word he he knew
[1:31:53] that the only way you could be be
[1:31:55] protected from the
[1:31:56] enemy when he came to Jesus what did
[1:31:59] Jesus
[1:32:00] do it is written he put the word on him
[1:32:03] he he did he didn't give him nothing but
[1:32:05] the word and and and that's what we got
[1:32:07] to do tonight we got to do that tomorrow
[1:32:09] in the day after that we got to use the
[1:32:11] word there's no other way around
[1:32:16] it he he came down on the earth and
[1:32:18] fortify his children with his
[1:32:21] word I want to ask you something just
[1:32:23] think
[1:32:24] he said now Eve did not why she Eve did
[1:32:27] not while she was standing in that great
[1:32:28] Fortress of his word and see she was
[1:32:31] behind the word right she was fortified
[1:32:33] behind the word but she made the choice
[1:32:36] to St to step out right so some don't
[1:32:39] don't step out
[1:32:40] tonight it get rough sometimes it get
[1:32:44] tough sometimes and we don't understand
[1:32:46] God sometimes and what he doing but just
[1:32:47] stay on the word don't leave the word
[1:32:50] it's the only thing that's going to see
[1:32:52] you through it's your protection it's
[1:32:54] the only thing that can protect
[1:32:57] [Music]
[1:33:02] you you know he constantly saying you
[1:33:05] know that that the word is your Fortress
[1:33:08] and and and and and David talked about
[1:33:10] it a lot right once he
[1:33:12] realized what his protection was they
[1:33:16] they always talk about the Lord as my
[1:33:17] Fortress he's my buckler he's my shield
[1:33:21] and and and David caught a revelation
[1:33:22] where his protection
[1:33:24] he knew if I could stand behind the word
[1:33:26] that my enemies couldn't get to me if
[1:33:29] you read psalms David D David was
[1:33:31] constantly talking about his enemies but
[1:33:33] but he knew that they couldn't touch him
[1:33:35] where he
[1:33:36] [Applause]
[1:33:39] was he say now Satan was on the outside
[1:33:41] trying to use some kind of technique to
[1:33:43] get in you know to get her out of there
[1:33:45] basically what we talking about right
[1:33:47] now she would have just stayed behind
[1:33:48] the word everything would have been fine
[1:33:51] and that's what we make our mistake we
[1:33:53] get from behind the
[1:33:55] word so now paragraph 30 say now we
[1:33:58] found out then in this great time of the
[1:34:00] beginning when God fortify his children
[1:34:02] yes sir in thisfor of his word right and
[1:34:05] he told them now that was it now just
[1:34:08] think he didn't turn the whole word she
[1:34:10] didn't turn the whole thing down she
[1:34:12] didn't say well God I guess it's all
[1:34:14] together wrong I don't believe a word of
[1:34:17] it no I believe half of it Lord no Satan
[1:34:20] just misconstrued a little bitty
[1:34:22] fraction of it not all of it just a
[1:34:25] little bit of it and because of that she
[1:34:27] listened to that one little term it
[1:34:30] caused every funeral possession made
[1:34:33] every grave made every gray hair every
[1:34:36] sick baby every sin that was ever
[1:34:39] committed because of just taking one
[1:34:41] little speck of God's word and just
[1:34:43] misplacing it that's right that's right
[1:34:46] so now you see how important it is to
[1:34:48] stay with the
[1:34:49] word we we get in trouble when we step
[1:34:51] from behind it that's right yes sir yes
[1:34:55] sir now if the infinite God a God full
[1:34:58] of love to misconstrue his word just
[1:35:02] don't believe all of it just part of it
[1:35:04] will let all this happen because of just
[1:35:07] misbelieving a little bit of it I
[1:35:10] believe we're going to have to take
[1:35:11] every bit of it back again cuz just
[1:35:13] muring it saying the Bible said this but
[1:35:16] honest it doesn't mean that it does mean
[1:35:19] that see it mean that just that way yes
[1:35:22] sir so we must keep it that way that's
[1:35:24] it the way he said it but then ew now
[1:35:27] we're going to find out as soon as she
[1:35:29] had to get as soon as he had to get
[1:35:31] Satan had to get her attention basically
[1:35:34] right now you remember he's in Warfare
[1:35:36] with God and men and women is his
[1:35:39] children so he's in Warfare with Satan
[1:35:42] so now remember Satan comes down to use
[1:35:44] a tactic to try to counteract God's
[1:35:46] welfare his protection he's trying to
[1:35:49] find something that he can a better
[1:35:51] weapon that's right so there is no
[1:35:53] better weapon that he can find so then
[1:35:55] the only typ that that he could use
[1:35:56] would be reasoning and when you start to
[1:35:59] reason anything the word said but let me
[1:36:01] see that doesn't mean by his christes we
[1:36:04] were healed that doesn't say it does
[1:36:06] mean that that's right so my my main
[1:36:10] thing is to get you to understand yes
[1:36:15] sir that you got to say what God
[1:36:19] said you got to say what God Said
[1:36:24] that's the safest place you can
[1:36:26] be is is is is what the word
[1:36:34] [Music]
[1:36:40] say and it reads on and it says
[1:36:43] whosoever will well I know the Holy
[1:36:45] Spirit was for them back in the early
[1:36:47] days but just reasoning just reasoning
[1:36:50] tell us that we oh no don't you do that
[1:36:53] whosoever will to you and your children
[1:36:56] and to them that's far off even as many
[1:36:59] as the Lord Our God shall call see no
[1:37:02] reasoning don't stop the reason just
[1:37:05] keep believing just believing what he
[1:37:07] said well brother Brenham I sought the
[1:37:09] Holy Ghost for 10 years what you
[1:37:11] reasoning about if you carried out his
[1:37:14] plans then just go on then just believe
[1:37:17] it see he laid down the plan and just
[1:37:19] follow that plan that's then it's got to
[1:37:22] come out right right if it isn't then he
[1:37:24] told something wrong see so he can tell
[1:37:27] us nothing wrong and still be God so you
[1:37:30] see you got to believe it it's his word
[1:37:33] or you don't believe him at all so it's
[1:37:36] strange isn't it but it's really true it
[1:37:39] really is the truth right now we find
[1:37:41] that this great enemy of God now as long
[1:37:45] as the will long as they will believe
[1:37:47] that that word I can never get to them
[1:37:50] as long as that little family in Eden
[1:37:52] keeps behind word I can never touch them
[1:37:55] that's right neither can he today amen
[1:37:58] he's still blocked off that's right but
[1:38:00] I can use some real good or strategy and
[1:38:03] just reason out I give some human
[1:38:05] reasoning because she's human evil was
[1:38:08] human and if I can just give human
[1:38:10] reasoning then well well we'll win the
[1:38:12] battle Satan and his angels but then e
[1:38:15] gave away so therefore we know our enemy
[1:38:18] by his attacks that's right maybe you
[1:38:20] didn't get maybe you didn't get it just
[1:38:22] right the way I said it we know our
[1:38:24] enemy when anyone any Spirit any person
[1:38:28] tries to disagree with God's word
[1:38:30] remember that's your
[1:38:32] enemy that's your enemy I don't care who
[1:38:36] it is that's your enemy we we know his
[1:38:39] older type that's right that's the one
[1:38:41] he broke the human race down that's
[1:38:43] right and that's the way he breaks them
[1:38:45] down yet today and that's the way he
[1:38:47] gets you away from God is to just
[1:38:50] believe his word and the only way that
[1:38:52] you can ever stand in fellowship with
[1:38:54] God and talk to him in the cool of the
[1:38:56] evening is to stay fortified in the word
[1:38:59] on both sides let the curtain of God's
[1:39:01] word just drop all around you and you be
[1:39:04] dropped right in the middle of it that's
[1:39:06] right then you floridly
[1:39:08] [Applause]
[1:39:09] [Music]
[1:39:11] glory this what Paul said in Galatians 1
[1:39:14] verse 8 and N he said but though we or
[1:39:18] an angel from heaven preach any other
[1:39:21] gospel unto you than that which we have
[1:39:23] preached unto you let him be a
[1:39:26] curse as we said before so say I now
[1:39:29] again if any man preach any gospel unto
[1:39:32] you that you have receive you have
[1:39:35] received let him be a curse that's right
[1:39:38] that's
[1:39:45] right I got one paragraph I want to use
[1:39:48] in take on the take on the whole Army of
[1:39:50] God sir in 1962 and it says paragraph 36
[1:39:55] it said not the enemy know as long as
[1:39:58] the human race stay with the word right
[1:40:00] he'll never be able to touch them now
[1:40:02] I'm beginning to feel religious right
[1:40:04] now as long as the human race stayed
[1:40:06] with the word god fortified his family
[1:40:08] on the earth his armor and the fort of
[1:40:10] his word that's our Fortress the name of
[1:40:13] the Lord is a mighty tower the righteous
[1:40:16] run into it and are safe they're
[1:40:18] fortified the Lord is the word they are
[1:40:20] in their fortified and safe forever more
[1:40:23] as long as the human race stays in the
[1:40:25] word long as the church stays in the
[1:40:28] word it's fortified there's nothing
[1:40:30] going to bother it so he he's telling
[1:40:32] you where your safety zone at but but M
[1:40:35] but what we got to do now we got to pull
[1:40:37] down these spiritual stron holes of the
[1:40:40] enemy if it's affecting your life you
[1:40:43] got to pull it down if if if it's
[1:40:45] draining your walk you got to pull it
[1:40:47] down if if you disbelieve in in any the
[1:40:49] area you got to pull it down and God
[1:40:51] said you got the power to do that
[1:40:55] [Applause]
[1:41:01] now think about the children of Israel
[1:41:03] when they came out
[1:41:05] yes now God God gave them 10 signs
[1:41:08] before they
[1:41:09] left yes sir 10 10 signs before they
[1:41:12] left 10 signs sir and when they came
[1:41:17] [Music]
[1:41:18] out and they find himself at the Red Sea
[1:41:23] I now the enemy came in and begin to
[1:41:27] create stron holes in the
[1:41:29] mind now what it is that would convince
[1:41:33] you that God can't take care of you
[1:41:35] after them 10
[1:41:38] signs you you you see how he begin to
[1:41:40] work on their mind they begin to murm
[1:41:43] and complain they came to the to the Red
[1:41:46] Sea and and they looking around like
[1:41:47] what we going to do you don't you just
[1:41:50] forgot the 10 signs that fast
[1:41:53] but see the enemy came in started
[1:41:56] working in their
[1:41:57] mind God brought you to the Red Sea now
[1:42:00] now what he going to do with you what he
[1:42:02] going to do with you then God come down
[1:42:04] and splits the Red
[1:42:07] Sea they walk through on dry
[1:42:10] [Applause]
[1:42:11] land I'm talking about the ground was
[1:42:13] hard as concrete they walk through on
[1:42:15] dry
[1:42:16] land and they get
[1:42:18] through and then they findel complaining
[1:42:21] again
[1:42:25] now God just split the Red
[1:42:28] Sea now you complaining talking about
[1:42:30] you
[1:42:32] [Applause]
[1:42:33] [Music]
[1:42:34] [Applause]
[1:42:37] hungry now you complaining talking about
[1:42:39] you
[1:42:40] hungry you see the tactic of the
[1:42:43] enemy now now I'm speaking for me in
[1:42:46] this day now if I would have been there
[1:42:48] and seen God do all this and split the
[1:42:50] Red Sea I wouldn't have had no doubt
[1:42:53] that he couldn't feed
[1:42:55] [Applause]
[1:42:59] me and it kept going on and on they got
[1:43:02] thirsty they wanted water and and and
[1:43:05] and the enemy tied them up so tight he
[1:43:08] worked on their mind so tight till they
[1:43:12] they didn't even realize the very thing
[1:43:14] that God was trying to show them the
[1:43:16] prophet of God say we focus on what God
[1:43:19] already done and we focus on what he
[1:43:21] going to do but but we don't focus on
[1:43:24] what he
[1:43:26] doing see the en the enemy had not got
[1:43:29] control of their mind so much so they
[1:43:31] didn't even catch the fight that God was

[1:51:58] Jordan and Elijah took his mle and
[1:52:01] wrapped it together and smoked the
[1:52:03] waters and they were divided
[1:52:06] hither and the so that they too went
[1:52:09] over on dry ground yes and it came to
[1:52:13] pass when they were gone over that
[1:52:15] Elijah said unto
[1:52:16] Elisha ask what I shall do for thee
[1:52:19] before I be taken from thee so so Elijah
[1:52:22] like Elijah just like you know he he

[1:54:22] my father my father The Chariot of
[1:54:25] Israel and the horsemen thereof and he
[1:54:28] saw him no more and he took hold of his

[1:58:42] encouraging
[1:58:43] scriptures to let you know our answers
[1:58:45] in the word this is our protection and
[1:58:48] when you when you find yourself battling
[1:58:50] these things go back to the word yeah
[1:58:52] the answer is right here in the word and
[1:58:54] you got to hold on to it Isaiah
[1:58:59] 43 CH 43:2 it said when thou passest
[1:59:02] through the waters I will be with thee
[1:59:05] that's sir and through the rivers they
[1:59:07] shall not overflow thee and where thou
[1:59:09] walkest through the fire thou shall not
[1:59:11] be burned neither shall the flame Kindle
[1:59:14] upon theeen and and I'm trying to come
[1:59:17] to a
[1:59:18] closeall and and and and the these
[1:59:20] things is is is you need to print them
[1:59:22] in your heart yes and and by the grace
[1:59:25] of God in closing I'm I'm I'm going to
[1:59:27] show you how how a Believer is once he's
[1:59:30] fortified behind the word once he know
[1:59:33] he's he's he's protected fully protected
[1:59:35] with the word let's turn to psalms
[1:59:41] 27 let's turn to Psalm
[1:59:50] 27 now this is for the Bel
[1:59:53] Believers this is for the Believers and
[1:59:55] see D like I said earlier David got to a
[1:59:58] place when he knew that God was his
[2:00:01] Fortress he was his protection he was
[2:00:04] his shield and he and he recognized that
[2:00:06] the enemy couldn't get to him and and
[2:00:07] and it and and and it put him in this
[2:00:09] position and he said the Lord is my
[2:00:11] light that's it and my
[2:00:14] salvation Whom Shall I Fear amen the
[2:00:17] Lord is the strength of my life of whom
[2:00:20] shall I be afraid
[2:00:22] and and I I can see David just just
[2:00:24] behind the stron holdes of the
[2:00:26] word and and he just on the inside
[2:00:29] looking out and and and he's saying when
[2:00:32] the wicked even my enemies and my foes
[2:00:36] Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they
[2:00:39] stumble and fail that's right and and
[2:00:41] and these are the thing that that David
[2:00:42] is witnessing while he's behind the
[2:00:44] protection of the word I I see the enemy
[2:00:46] coming and try to TP but I'm also
[2:00:48] watching him fall I see him coming from
[2:00:50] the side but I'm also watching him fall
[2:00:52] so he he's in a good place right now and
[2:00:55] and that's what you got to do you got to
[2:00:57] get fortified behind the word so you can
[2:00:59] just sit back and watch the dev I seen
[2:01:00] you coming but it didn't work I see you
[2:01:02] trying but it ain't going to work and
[2:01:04] and that's the place where David got to
[2:01:07] and he in in verse three he said though
[2:01:09] and hoost should have Camp against me my
[2:01:11] heart should not fear I'm not going to
[2:01:13] fear though War should rise against me
[2:01:16] and this will I be confident I'm going
[2:01:18] to be confident God is going to protect
[2:01:20] me I'm going to be confident God God is
[2:01:22] going to give me a w and Escape sir and
[2:01:24] one thing have I desired of the Lord
[2:01:26] that will I seek after that I may dwell
[2:01:28] in the house of the Lord all the days of
[2:01:30] my life to behold the beauty of the Lord
[2:01:34] and to inquire in his Temple for in a
[2:01:37] time of trouble he shall hide me in his
[2:01:39] Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle
[2:01:42] he shall hide me he shall set me upon a
[2:01:44] rock and now shall my head be lifted up
[2:01:48] above my enemies round about me
[2:01:50] therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle
[2:01:52] sacrifices of Joy I will sing yay I will
[2:01:55] sing praises unto the Lord hear ye oh
[2:01:58] Lord when I cry with my voice have mercy
[2:02:01] also upon me and answer me when thou say
[2:02:04] Seek Ye my face my heart said unto thee
[2:02:07] thy face Lord will I see hide not thy
[2:02:10] face far from me put not thy servant
[2:02:12] away in Anger thou has been my help

[2:02:32] way oh Lord and Lead Me in a plain path
[2:02:35] because of my enemies deliver me not
[2:02:38] over into the will of my enemies for
[2:02:40] false Witnesses are rising up against me
[2:02:42] and such as breathe out cruelty I have
[2:02:45] fainted unless I had to believe to see
[2:02:48] the goodness of the Lord in the land of
[2:02:51] the living wait on the Lord be of good
[2:02:54] courage and he shall strengthen thy
[2:02:56] heart wait I say on the
[2:03:01] [Applause]
[2:03:09] [Music]
[2:03:12] Lord there's no reason why any believers
[2:03:16] should be bound tonight Hall with all
[2:03:18] this word we got this you shouldn't be
[2:03:21] bound amen I just I just want to let you

[2:06:46] already and we believe God will touch
[2:06:49] you and restore you let's go to first
[2:06:52] king chapter 19 verse 16 it's a
[2:06:57] convention so let's see something here
[2:07:00] amen because this word keep opening up
[2:07:03] all the time if you thereare you can say
[2:07:06] Amen first king
[2:07:09] 19:16 this is Elijah going to the
[2:07:12] mountain and then when he went to the
[2:07:15] mountain God spoke to him after he
[2:07:17] killed the prophet of baale he went and
[2:07:20] he seen the earthquake and all those
[2:07:22] things and then there were a still Small
[2:07:24] Voice that came and the Lord spoke to
[2:07:27] Elijah and notice here when God is
[2:07:29] speaking to Elijah Elisha is not here I
[2:07:32] want you to notice something verse 16
[2:07:35] God says this he
[2:07:37] says and jiu the son of Nima shall that
[2:07:42] anoint to be king over
[2:07:45] Israel and
[2:07:48] Elisha the son of japat of Abel Abel
[2:07:54] Meola shall that anoint to be prophet in
[2:07:58] that
[2:08:00] room so God met with Elijah
[2:08:04] alone and gave Elijah the promise of
[2:08:09] Elisha when Elisha have not even
[2:08:12] started his ministry with
[2:08:16] Elijah is my Bible different than your
[2:08:19] Bible do you want me to continue or you
[2:08:21] want to go home Elisha is not here
[2:08:25] Elisha is not even aware of this amen
[2:08:31] but God already gave his Word of Promise
[2:08:34] that the replacement the one who will
[2:08:37] replace Elijah is Elisha so technically
[2:08:41] speaking the anointing of
[2:08:44] Elijah is
[2:08:47] [Applause]
[2:08:49] guaranteed to Elisha
[2:08:52] when Elisha was still working with
[2:08:55] Ox so your
[2:08:58] position was already
[2:09:01] guaranteed before you come in the work
[2:09:03] of the
[2:09:05] Lord before Elisha begin to serve the
[2:09:08] Lord God already gave a promise God gave
[2:09:12] his position and God gave his anointing
[2:09:16] and Elisha was not aware of that
[2:09:19] anointing
[2:09:22] are we together do you want me to
[2:09:24] continue do you want me to continue I
[2:09:27] want you to understand these things
[2:09:29] clearly number one Elisha was not aware
[2:09:33] that God have something in store for him
[2:09:36] you want to stand or sit stand so ah
[2:09:40] praise God so Elisha was not aware that
[2:09:43] God already have something for him and
[2:09:46] he was not even aware of the
[2:09:49] caliber that God about him nobody you
[2:09:54] it's you don't take anyone to replace
[2:09:57] Elijah because Elijah was a major
[2:10:01] prophet but look at this little bit of
[2:10:03] man working over there in a warehouse
[2:10:08] somewhere packing boxes did know that
[2:10:12] you are the one to replace
[2:10:15] Elijah are we together do you see Elisha
[2:10:20] here let's see what
[2:10:23] happened are we together jum to verse uh
[2:10:27] 19 the Bible say so he departed then
[2:10:32] Elijah yes sir and found
[2:10:35] Elisha the son of shaat who was plowing
[2:10:39] normal
[2:10:40] work with 12 yoke of oxen before him and
[2:10:45] he with the 12 one number 12 worship and
[2:10:49] Elijah passed by him and his mantle upon
[2:10:52] him he didn't pray for him he didn't do
[2:10:56] anything somebody's working maybe
[2:10:58] putting boxes in a big truck and elishah
[2:11:01] just took his jacket
[2:11:06] off and thre to Elijah amen watch what
[2:11:10] happened verse 20 and he left the
[2:11:14] oxen who talked to
[2:11:17] him verse 12 20 and he left the oxen
[2:11:21] and run after Elijah and say let me appr
[2:11:26] pray thee kiss my father and my mother
[2:11:29] and then I will follow thee and he said
[2:11:32] unto him go back again what have I done
[2:11:35] unto thee in other word what's wrong
[2:11:36] with
[2:11:38] you my question is who taught Elijah who
[2:11:42] talked to Elijah
[2:11:44] Elisha all they did is throw something
[2:11:48] there but that me had a message
[2:11:53] I don't know if you get there everybody
[2:11:55] that was there maybe saw the mantle
[2:11:58] hidden but Elijah didn't see the manle
[2:12:01] he heard something and he understood
[2:12:04] something and because he understood he
[2:12:07] went to Elisha and said you know what
[2:12:09] I'm going to leave everything and I'm
[2:12:11] going to follow you who told you to
[2:12:13] follow Elijah how did he get the message
[2:12:17] how did he understand are we together
[2:12:21] because God will do things in this
[2:12:24] church but you need to be able to
[2:12:27] understand what God is speaking with
[2:12:31] speaking are we together sir are we
[2:12:33] together if you truly CAU the Revelation
[2:12:36] it will make you behave different
[2:12:41] sir maybe somebody will look and say
[2:12:44] this man through the Garment and you
[2:12:45] following him did he tell you to follow
[2:12:48] him that message was only for one person
[2:12:52] are we together are we
[2:12:54] together let's go to second king chapter
[2:12:58] 9 I just want you to see this and I'm
[2:13:01] going to let you go
[2:13:02] home second king chapter 1 the promise
[2:13:06] belong to Elijah God already promised to
[2:13:10] Elisha it is his position it is his
[2:13:13] anointing it is his place and all they
[2:13:17] did they took him under the ministry of
[2:13:20] Elijah and and he begin to minister to
[2:13:22] Elijah 10 Years brother Bram says amen
[2:13:27] and during 10 years God allow him to sit
[2:13:32] and to see the power yes to see the 10
[2:13:37] Sons to see so many example how God is
[2:13:41] working in the ministry of Elijah to
[2:13:44] cause him Amen to begin to
[2:13:48] desire what was already for him
[2:13:54] I don't know if you know you understand
[2:13:55] what I'm saying God put him on next to
[2:14:00] what he needed the very thing that you
[2:14:03] were looking at God put you next to it
[2:14:07] so that the longer you spend time with
[2:14:10] it it begin to create an
[2:14:13] attraction it begin to create a pool it
[2:14:16] begin to create it begin to bring your
[2:14:19] attention to be focus on this his
[2:14:23] attention was no longer
[2:14:25] oxen no longer the job that he was
[2:14:28] working but now his attention is brought
[2:14:31] throughout his
[2:14:33] Destiny are we together are we together
[2:14:38] second king chapter 9 drop to verse
[2:14:42] 9 if you dare I mean sorry 2 King
[2:14:46] chapter 2:9 if you dare you can say Amen
[2:14:51] all of this came and I was sitting right
[2:14:54] there are we
[2:14:56] together verse n we there now remember
[2:15:02] when he's following Elijah amen Elijah
[2:15:06] himself tried to block
[2:15:08] him sir Elisha knew the Revelation but
[2:15:13] elishah turned around and say you know
[2:15:15] what you stay here but there was already
[2:15:18] something
[2:15:19] created in Elisha that even Elijah could
[2:15:23] not stop
[2:15:27] it are we together what belongs to you
[2:15:31] even God himself won't stop
[2:15:37] you I don't know if you get what I'm
[2:15:39] saying amen everybody knew that Elijah
[2:15:42] was going amen but they only knew by
[2:15:48] information but they didn't have the
[2:15:51] revelation of the going people may quote
[2:15:55] this message but they can quote this
[2:15:58] message as an information but you need
[2:16:01] to know this message more than an
[2:16:03] information to you it's a life you know
[2:16:07] it but why are you not following Elijah
[2:16:10] because the promise did not belong to
[2:16:14] them I don't know if you get what I'm
[2:16:16] saying you are following what belongs to
[2:16:18] you so don't expect everybody to walk
[2:16:22] with
[2:16:22] you Hall your promise is not a
[2:16:27] collective promise it is an individual
[2:16:30] promise in other word when you hold on
[2:16:33] to something don't expect to receive
[2:16:36] support from everybody matter of fact
[2:16:39] they are people who discourage you but
[2:16:43] because he belong to you there is
[2:16:46] something
[2:16:47] Supernatural that is beyond you will
[2:16:51] push you toward
[2:16:54] it are we together are we together verse
[2:16:58] 9 if you dare you can say
[2:17:01] Amen the Bible says I'm just backing him
[2:17:05] up of what he preached amen the Bible
[2:17:09] says in verse 9 and it came to pass when
[2:17:12] they were gone over that Elijah say unto
[2:17:18] elishah ask
[2:17:21] what I shall do to thee before I be
[2:17:24] taken
[2:17:25] away what should Elijah
[2:17:29] ask if you
[2:17:31] notice even though the promise belonged
[2:17:33] to
[2:17:34] him Elijah told him ask so you are
[2:17:39] asking something that already belong to
[2:17:44] you you didn't get it my friend so when
[2:17:47] you come to God and you say I want to be
[2:17:50] healed you need to know first that that
[2:17:53] healing already belong to you that's the
[2:17:56] reason why I'm asking I don't know if
[2:18:00] you get what I'm saying I am not just
[2:18:02] asking this marriage like this I already
[2:18:05] know it for me that's the reason why I'm
[2:18:10] asking Lord help Mercy he say ask what I
[2:18:14] shall do for thee therefore before I be
[2:18:17] taken away from thee
[2:18:19] amen and elishah say I pray thee let a
[2:18:24] double portion of that Spirit be upon
[2:18:27] you why didn't he ask anything except
[2:18:31] that
[2:18:32] spirit because God already
[2:18:35] spoke that Elisha will be the one
[2:18:38] replacing Elijah so what was coming out
[2:18:42] from his
[2:18:44] mouth amen is nothing but what already
[2:18:48] spoke when he was not even dead
[2:18:52] are we
[2:18:54] together this is where I want you to see
[2:18:57] verse 10 and he said
[2:19:00] Elijah thou has asked an easy
[2:19:04] thing you ask
[2:19:07] what hard based on
[2:19:12] what I'm asking you a question it's hard
[2:19:15] based on what because God already
[2:19:19] said that elishah will take the place of
[2:19:23] Elijah so why is he
[2:19:25] hard it should not be hard what I'm
[2:19:28] trying to say is what you think it's
[2:19:32] hard for you to get just know it's not
[2:19:39] hard when you hit a wall in your life
[2:19:42] and something looks to be super hard
[2:19:44] this is a confirmation that it belongs
[2:19:46] to me
[2:19:49] [Music]
[2:19:50] amen
[2:19:52] hallelujah oh glory to God he says and
[2:19:55] he says th have asked hard things
[2:20:00] nevertheless if thou see me when I'm
[2:20:02] taken from thee it shall be so unto thee
[2:20:06] but if not it shall not be so in other
[2:20:09] word keep your focus on me keep your
[2:20:12] focus on the promise the promise already
[2:20:15] belong to
[2:20:17] you the pull of the promise is already
[2:20:19] pulling you
[2:20:21] you are already asking for the promise
[2:20:24] it is not going to be anything too hard
[2:20:26] for the Lord because the Bible say is
[2:20:29] there anything too hard for the Lord it
[2:20:32] is not too hard for you because it
[2:20:34] belongs to you all you have to do is
[2:20:37] keep the pro
[2:20:38] focus focus on your promise sir don't
[2:20:42] listen to the devil focus on your
[2:20:44] promise don't go under destraction focus
[2:20:48] on your promise
[2:20:51] this is what God is telling you
[2:20:54] tonight what are you trying to say I'm
[2:20:56] going to finish by this my friend and
[2:20:59] you go home brother brandham say in the
[2:21:02] message the everpresent
[2:21:04] word in
[2:21:07] 1961 uh July 23rd in the morning
[2:21:11] paragraph
[2:21:13] 121 brother Bram say that is what power
[2:21:17] is in the church now but it control by a
[2:21:21] law and that law is not keeping a bunch
[2:21:24] of Commandments it is a law of Faith
[2:21:28] that's right yes sir Jesus say all
[2:21:32] things yes sir are possible to them that
[2:21:36] believe in other word there is nothing
[2:21:38] too
[2:21:42] hard

[2:21:47] it you ready what
[2:21:51] whatever
[2:21:53] God will lead your soul to believe that
[2:21:59] is
[2:22:01] [Music]
[2:22:03] yours can I repeat it again whatever the
[2:22:07] Lord will lead your soul to believe it
[2:22:11] is yours the soul of Elia was led to ask
[2:22:17] to believe for the double portion
[2:22:19] because the portion belongs to him in
[2:22:22] other words that pool that attraction is
[2:22:25] a son that he already belonged to
[2:22:32] [Music]
[2:22:33] you when I'm saying this there are
[2:22:36] things that belong to me and don't
[2:22:37] belong to you so I'm not waiting for you
[2:22:40] to uh agree with me if you agree that
[2:22:44] fan if you don't agree maybe it doesn't
[2:22:47] belong to you but it belongs to me
[2:22:50] because I feel the pull in my heart that
[2:22:53] I need to have that one you don't feel
[2:22:56] the pool maybe you're not part of it so
[2:22:58] don't block me move out of my
[2:23:03] [Applause]
[2:23:04] way are we
[2:23:07] together let me finish with this brother
[2:23:11] Brown I'm say every place that the soul
[2:23:15] of your foot can set upon by faith God
[2:23:19] gives it to you am amen it is yours you
[2:23:24] possess it if you can find the key to
[2:23:27] this law of faith that Ops that open it
[2:23:30] to you you see what I mean the power is
[2:23:33] control if you are a son of God you are
[2:23:37] a Daughters of a daughter of God that
[2:23:39] never leaves you it is with you all the
[2:23:42] time but your faith gets away from it
[2:23:45] but he still there Hallelujah
[2:23:51] why did Elisha focus on his promise
[2:23:54] because he belongs to him he was not
[2:23:57] there in M caramel but something within
[2:24:01] him was puling saying this belong to me
[2:24:05] and any obstacle that came against him
[2:24:07] from the brother from the sons of the
[2:24:10] Prophet to tell him that you're not
[2:24:12] going to get it you talking about this
[2:24:14] third pool third pool you're not going
[2:24:16] to get that third pull you can say all
[2:24:18] you want that was only for brother

[2:24:33] for me and this church we will cross
[2:24:36] Jord we will keep our eyes focused on
[2:24:39] the word I don't care how hard the
[2:24:42] promises are but those promises belong
[2:24:44] to us because there is a deep that is
[2:24:48] calling to the deep and if there is deep
[2:24:50] that is calling to the Deep there must
[2:24:53] be a deep to respond to it and I believe
[2:24:56] what I want is coming because this is
[2:24:59] the year stay focused on the word stay
[2:25:02] focused on the promise God is not a man
