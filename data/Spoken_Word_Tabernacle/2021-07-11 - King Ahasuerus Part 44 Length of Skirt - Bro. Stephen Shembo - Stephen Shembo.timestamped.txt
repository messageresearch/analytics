[21:00] like to speak out this morning
[21:02] amen yes sir what you got brother
[21:14] was it last monday uh brother robert and
[21:18] i were at the church uh
[21:20] working and uh i was up
[21:24] front there toward the platform that
[21:27] little door there i was working out that
[21:28] back door
[21:30] and there's a step there that brother
[21:34] robert
[21:35] built that has to pull out
[21:38] so they can get up under the platform
[21:40] there
[21:42] and i was putting baseboard in
[21:45] and right there where that step is uh
[21:49] that baseboard it can't be attached to
[21:52] the wall
[21:54] so so it has to come out so that step
[21:56] can come out
[21:59] so i was out back there working and
[22:03] what i had to do was make an l-shaped
[22:06] piece of trim there and
[22:11] so i was i was putting them together and
[22:14] uh and i don't know what happened
[22:18] the uh the gun it's it was a
[22:21] trim nailer with 80 pounds of pressure
[22:24] behind it
[22:27] the gun slipped off of the wood
[22:30] and it hit my leg right here
[22:34] and when those when those go off there's
[22:37] a nail coming out
[22:41] and i felt it but it didn't hurt
[22:46] and so i went on working and
[22:50] sometime later i went back to brother
[22:52] robert and told him what
[22:54] what had happened and and we prayed
[22:56] there
[22:58] and he took me to the urgent care and
[23:02] he just looked at it and i mean there
[23:04] was a there was blood there
[23:06] a little spot of blood and
[23:12] but it didn't hurt you know
[23:16] so we went back and kept working and
[23:19] then i went home and my wife asked me if
[23:21] i was going to the er
[23:22] i said no because it doesn't hurt
[23:26] well brother stephen called me late that
[23:28] night and he persuaded me to go to the
[23:30] er
[23:32] which i did and they took pictures of it
[23:35] and there was nothing there
[23:38] um so yesterday
[23:43] i'm back down here at the church working
[23:46] on that same
[23:47] at back out that back door there
[23:51] and finishing up what i started
[23:54] and i looked down
[23:57] and this nail is laying on the step
[24:02] i'm thinking well how in the world did
[24:04] that get there
[24:06] one single nail and
[24:10] i don't like to say i don't know what
[24:12] happened
[24:13] i just know that gun slipped off the
[24:16] off that wood hit me in the leg i felt
[24:19] it hit
[24:21] and i have no clue
[24:25] you know all i can say is just the lord
[24:28] just
[24:28] and then yesterday when i found that
[24:30] nail laying there
[24:32] i'm thinking somehow the lord just
[24:35] caused that nail to
[24:38] do something so
[24:45] hallelujah hey
[24:48] man it happened with a bullet in that
[24:51] and wasn't there a story about a bullet
[24:53] that came through the window and hit a
[24:54] woman in uh in service
[24:56] just bounced off of her if he can do it
[24:58] with a bullet he can do it with a nail
[24:59] with 80 pounds of pressure on it
[25:02] i've known people that you know the gun
[25:04] goes off on top of a roof
[25:07] and hits somebody on the ground and goes
[25:09] in it went in this one guy's head that i
[25:11] know
[25:12] so there's a lot of pressure there
[25:13] dangerous we'll praise god
[25:16] anybody else have a praise report this
[25:18] morning
[25:19] amen i'll go to the prayer request
[25:27] um i've got a couple actually um myself
[25:29] for prayer requests i had um one of my
[25:31] co-workers
[25:32] texted me and um we got a little
[25:35] three-way chat we don't we don't
[25:36] actually work together anymore but we
[25:38] keep in touch
[25:39] and um one of them had mentioned
[25:42] something about um
[25:44] a post that somebody had made about
[25:45] cancer one of our ex-co-workers and uh
[25:48] come to find out that um i've worked
[25:51] with him off and on for years his mom
[25:53] has been diagnosed with cancer and his
[25:55] uncle

[26:06] names of the people

[26:26] i'm in a position now where i do quite a
[26:27] bit of shoveling
[26:28] at work and um i don't know
[26:32] i don't know if it's just got to me this
[26:33] week or whatever because it happens i
[26:35] shovel a lot but you know

[26:40] move and it'll grab me just on the right
[26:42] side so if y'all can just um
[26:44] you know just remember yes ma'am
[26:52] my mother about two years ago has
[26:54] shingles but she didn't know what it was

[26:56] her a while before she actually told my
[26:59] sisters that she was having pain over
[27:01] here on the side and
[27:02] they took her to the doctor
[27:06] she's been in pain ever since she has
[27:07] seen already all these doctors and
[27:09] specialists
[27:10] acupuncture massage therapy and
[27:12] everything there is nothing else we can
[27:13] do but

[27:25] two years is a long time to suffer from
[27:32] shingles
[27:38] they actually came over one time her and

[27:52] she said she did a lot of witnessing
[27:54] down there so we
[27:55] you know but god said those that you
[27:57] love and those that love you
[28:00] waited too so that if she would have
[28:03] identified that she would right away
[28:06] she would have gotten help but she
[28:08] waited too long and therefore
[28:10] made it home in an earth

[58:32] soar psalm chapter 45. i know somebody
[58:36] will go back to the scripture what are
[58:38] they what are they
[58:41] psalm 45 if you there you can say amen
[58:45] verse 9
[58:48] king's daughters were among
[58:51] your honorable women you might be
[58:54] sitting so the daughters of the king
[58:56] are not filthy they are honorable
[59:00] they need to be treated with respect we
[59:03] went through
[59:04] all of this when we explained you the
[59:05] way the woman was created
[59:08] and how much respect and honor should be
[59:10] given to her
[59:11] not treating her like a devil but you're
[59:14] treating her
[59:15] like a son of god so king's daughter
[59:19] were among your honorable women
[59:22] upon your right hand did stand who
[59:26] the queen the bride in gold
[59:30] of offer so david right here is saying
[59:34] that there is a bride
[59:36] that is sitting beside the king
[59:39] and that bride as she sits her
[59:43] clothing the clothing of the blood
[59:47] or the clothing of the queen is made out
[59:50] of water
[59:51] and god speak of water
[59:56] so when you look at the clothing of this
[59:58] woman
[59:59] he all speak about the deity of god
[1:00:03] can your club give an information like
[1:00:06] that one
[1:00:07] when somebody look at you dress and
[1:00:10] they look at you they say this look like
[1:00:11] a child of the king
[1:00:14] [Music]
[1:00:15] amen the clothing of the queen
[1:00:19] is in god of offer verse 10
[1:00:22] hearken or daughter and consider
[1:00:27] and incline your ear forget
[1:00:30] also your own people because you came
[1:00:33] from a strange land
[1:00:35] and your father's house if you remember
[1:00:36] when we spoke about
[1:00:38] the woman when israel went to war and
[1:00:41] they want to get a woman she have to
[1:00:42] shave her head
[1:00:44] and she have to mourn for her father's
[1:00:46] house you got to forget the first house
[1:00:49] completely off because we were born into
[1:00:51] the world
[1:00:52] you got to forget that first house
[1:00:54] completely amen
[1:00:56] forget also your own people the people
[1:00:58] that used to be your friend
[1:01:00] those that used to hang out with you in
[1:01:02] the nightclub
[1:01:03] smoking weed and every kind of things
[1:01:06] forget your own people
[1:01:08] forget your father's house so
[1:01:11] shall the king greatly desire your water
[1:01:16] god is not interested in the beauty of
[1:01:19] the world god wants you to be separated
[1:01:23] first from the world
[1:01:25] then you're going to receive a second
[1:01:27] beauty and that beauty is what god
[1:01:29] is going to desire to heaven a bread
[1:01:32] without spot and water
[1:01:34] winkle everybody clear so shall the king
[1:01:38] greatly desire your beauty
[1:01:41] so if there is no separation with your
[1:01:43] own people
[1:01:44] there is no separation with your first
[1:01:46] house your father's house
[1:01:48] then god will not greatly desire you
[1:01:52] verse 11 so shall the king desire
[1:01:54] greatly desire your beauty
[1:01:56] for he is your lord he is your honor
[1:01:59] remember
[1:02:00] sarah say my lord my owner he is your
[1:02:04] honor he's the one that pays the price
[1:02:06] of redemption he's the one that claimed
[1:02:08] you that redeem you
[1:02:09] by going all the way to the cross and
[1:02:12] die the
[1:02:13] death of the cross to redeem you so he
[1:02:15] owns you he's your lord
[1:02:17] amen for he is your lord and
[1:02:20] worship you him verse 12
[1:02:24] and the daughter of time shall be there
[1:02:27] with a gift even the rich among the
[1:02:30] people
[1:02:31] shall entreat your favor everybody will
[1:02:34] be looking for you
[1:02:35] people would give you stuff for some
[1:02:38] reason
[1:02:39] if you don't believe it sit with me i'm
[1:02:41] gonna give you testimony after testimony
[1:02:43] after testimony amen my wife wanted to
[1:02:47] do her braiding in uh
[1:02:48] in somebody else's place and her car was
[1:02:51] so dirty
[1:02:52] and she left the car on outside they
[1:02:54] were braiding my daughter's head
[1:02:56] of hair on the inside when my wife left
[1:02:59] the young people in the house by
[1:03:01] themselves
[1:03:02] went outside and washed my cars
[1:03:06] for free
[1:03:09] [Music]
[1:03:12] i can give you testimony of the
[1:03:14] testimony after testimony
[1:03:16] just like that amen so the daughter of
[1:03:19] tyre
[1:03:19] shall be there with a gift even the rich
[1:03:23] among the people shall entreat your
[1:03:25] favor people will be looking at you
[1:03:28] because you got something special that
[1:03:29] can help them
[1:03:31] verse 13 the king's daughter
[1:03:34] is all water glorious where
[1:03:40] we know that when we spoke about the
[1:03:41] black dog and a white dog
[1:03:44] that we have two parts we have the inner
[1:03:47] being
[1:03:49] everybody there the inner man or the
[1:03:52] inward man
[1:03:53] that the scripture called and we have
[1:03:55] the outer man amen
[1:03:57] by the scripture david says that the
[1:03:59] daughter of the king
[1:04:01] will be glory as well within in her
[1:04:04] heart
[1:04:07] she'll be all glorious
[1:04:11] and the condition of the heart is going
[1:04:14] to be reflected
[1:04:15] upon the assad because the prostitute in
[1:04:18] proverbs 7
[1:04:20] if you remember she looks like a harlot
[1:04:23] and her heart was also saddled so the
[1:04:26] heart was reflected on the outside
[1:04:29] verse 13 the king's daughter is all
[1:04:31] glorious way
[1:04:33] weaving on the inside in the heart
[1:04:36] her water so the condition
[1:04:40] of the heart influenced
[1:04:43] the the clothing the condition
[1:04:46] of the heart had an impact
[1:04:50] on the clothing
[1:04:55] so if the clothing is wrong sometime
[1:04:58] check
[1:05:00] all righty somebody say it for her
[1:05:03] clothing
[1:05:04] is of rotten water
[1:05:08] the queen have the clothing of gold
[1:05:12] so on the inside her heart is glorious
[1:05:17] and that glory is expressed on the
[1:05:20] outside
[1:05:21] by gold so the beauty of the inside
[1:05:26] is a divine beauty a deity beauty
[1:05:30] and that beauty expressed itself on the
[1:05:33] outside
[1:05:34] because in the garden of eden in genesis
[1:05:37] 3 when man sin in the garden of eden
[1:05:41] god pick up a lamb and cloth his
[1:05:44] children with the lamb
[1:05:46] amen so on the outside when they look at
[1:05:50] the children of god
[1:05:51] and adam and eve all you can see is an
[1:05:54] expression
[1:05:54] of a bleeding lamb a bleeding
[1:05:58] word
[1:06:02] a bleeding lamb a bleeding word which
[1:06:06] was speaking of christ himself
[1:06:08] verse 13 again the king's daughter is
[1:06:11] all glorious within
[1:06:13] her clothing is of rot gold on the
[1:06:16] outside about clear
[1:06:19] verse 14 she shall be brought to the
[1:06:22] king
[1:06:23] in remnant of neil the work the virgins
[1:06:26] her companion
[1:06:27] that follow her shall be brought to you
[1:06:33] verse 15 with gladness and rejoicing
[1:06:36] shall they be brought they shall enter
[1:06:39] into the king water
[1:06:41] because the king is delighting on the
[1:06:44] queen
[1:06:45] let's go to zephaniah chapter one again
[1:06:48] we read it last week we're going to read
[1:06:51] it again
[1:06:53] unless your boss tell me something if we
[1:06:56] finish here then we
[1:06:58] go back up to the surface amen
[1:07:01] zephaniah chapter 1 verse 7.
[1:07:06] you go to daniel then you begin to go
[1:07:08] slowly 35 miles an hour you're going to
[1:07:10] see zephaniah
[1:07:13] after daniel then you're going to see
[1:07:15] the ammos or somebody
[1:07:17] slowly zephaniah chapter 1 verse 7
[1:07:22] hold your peace at the presence of the
[1:07:24] lord for the day of the lord is at hand
[1:07:27] for the lord had prepared a sacrifice i
[1:07:29] explained to you last week
[1:07:31] he has beat his guests and it shall come
[1:07:34] to pass in the day of the lord's
[1:07:36] sacrifice when god is coming to destroy
[1:07:39] everything
[1:07:40] that i will punish the princes and the
[1:07:43] king's children
[1:07:45] and all such as our clothes with water
[1:07:50] when your clothing are not good you are
[1:07:54] doomed for destruction
[1:07:56] because your clothing is an expression
[1:07:59] of your
[1:07:59] [Music]
[1:08:03] amen so decent time there is a
[1:08:05] destruction coming up
[1:08:07] in order to avoid the destruction you
[1:08:10] must be connected to malachi 4
[1:08:13] because malachi 4 was sent
[1:08:17] to return the water
[1:08:22] everybody you need the ministry of
[1:08:25] malachi 4 to prepare your heart
[1:08:28] because once your heart is prepared then
[1:08:31] automatically your clothing
[1:08:33] will be affected because your outside
[1:08:36] is only an expression of your inside
[1:08:40] let's go to john chapter 15
[1:08:42] [Music]
[1:08:44] hallelujah john chapter 15

[1:10:23] david but whatsoever
[1:10:27] he shall hear that shall he speak
[1:10:30] and he will show you things to water

[1:13:44] to the message of the hour we talk to
[1:13:47] you about the easter
[1:13:48] tradition of banis easter on itself is
[1:13:52] good
[1:13:53] but the tradition around easter the

[1:14:00] of hedonism
[1:14:01] we talked to you about the god of
[1:14:03] variety
[1:14:04] that god created you according to a
[1:14:07] certain category
[1:14:09] whether you're a black man you're a
[1:14:10] white man you're a hispanic or
[1:14:13] you an indian it's god that created you

[1:14:36] what is the responsibility of a man
[1:14:38] as the head of the household and what
[1:14:40] are the responsibility of a man in a
[1:14:42] marriage
[1:14:43] we talk to you about your friendship who
[1:14:46] should be your friend
[1:14:48] who you should be associated with we
[1:14:50] talked to you last week
[1:14:52] about the high heel and the impact of

[1:15:06] to be concealed
[1:15:08] or to be covered all of this and the
[1:15:11] other one that we discussed
[1:15:13] were completely the territory of the
[1:15:15] black dog
[1:15:17] in roman chapter 1 verse 8
[1:15:20] paul says that first i thank my
[1:15:24] god through jesus christ for you all
[1:15:27] why paul do you thank god for the roman
[1:15:30] christian
[1:15:32] he says that your faith
[1:15:36] everybody clear your faith what you
[1:15:39] believe
[1:15:40] your foundation what you are standing
[1:15:43] for
[1:15:44] your belief your religion
[1:15:47] if i can call it that way your
[1:15:50] christianity
[1:15:51] because there is many kind of
[1:15:52] christianity amen
[1:15:55] your faith is spoken of throughout
[1:15:58] the whole world so there was something
[1:16:02] about the christian in rome
[1:16:05] that their faith in god
[1:16:08] was influencing everybody all over the
[1:16:11] world
[1:16:12] amen in second corinthians chapter three
[1:16:16] verse two
[1:16:17] paul says that ye are our written
[1:16:21] epistle how did you wrote a paul
[1:16:25] in our heart known and read
[1:16:28] of all men amen
[1:16:32] for as much as he had manifestly
[1:16:36] declared to be the epistle of water
[1:16:40] of who christ ministered by who
[1:16:43] so paul preached the word of god
[1:16:47] paul preached christ or the message of
[1:16:50] his death to the people
[1:16:52] and the people paul was preaching to
[1:16:55] took the sermon of paul and begin to
[1:16:59] leave the sermon of paul until
[1:17:02] people that didn't have a chance to read
[1:17:05] the bible
[1:17:07] all people that never came in contact
[1:17:09] with
[1:17:10] paul all people that never came in
[1:17:13] contact with the message of
[1:17:15] can look through the christians that
[1:17:18] listen to paul
[1:17:20] and they can see exactly what god was
[1:17:23] speaking through the edge
[1:17:26] paul says that he are manifestly
[1:17:28] declared
[1:17:29] to be the epistle of christ minister by
[1:17:32] eyes we are channels
[1:17:34] that the lord have used written not with
[1:17:37] ink but with water the spirit
[1:17:41] of the living god in other words the
[1:17:43] holy spirit
[1:17:44] by bringing his word to the church
[1:17:48] that word of the holy spirit was going
[1:17:51] in the inside
[1:17:52] heart of the people and once the word
[1:17:55] whatever happened in the subconscious
[1:17:58] in your heart automatically will be
[1:18:01] displayed on the outside
[1:18:03] and when the world begin to be displayed
[1:18:05] in the life of the children of god
[1:18:08] then the children of god became living a
[1:18:12] peaceful that's why brother branham said
[1:18:14] that the two spies
[1:18:16] that went and talked to rehab were taps
[1:18:20] it is not that in jericho they had a
[1:18:23] player
[1:18:24] but those spies repeated exactly what
[1:18:28] joshua said
[1:18:30] until if you listen to them you will
[1:18:32] think it's
[1:18:33] joshua who's talking amen
[1:18:37] that's the kind of ministry we wanted
[1:18:39] amen
[1:18:40] he said written not with ink but with
[1:18:44] the spirit of the living god
[1:18:46] not in a table of stone like in the old
[1:18:49] testament
[1:18:50] but in the fleshly table of your water
[1:18:55] in the message communion brother branham
[1:18:58] say
[1:18:58] you know you are part of this gospel
[1:19:02] you are written epistle of what we are
[1:19:05] water
[1:19:07] or preaching and as long as we do
[1:19:10] something that is reproachful
[1:19:14] then we are indebted to what we are
[1:19:17] listening to
[1:19:19] everybody if preach you something
[1:19:23] and then after you already receive the
[1:19:26] knowledge of what god already told you
[1:19:29] if you do something contrary
[1:19:32] to what you have been taught then you
[1:19:35] are causing problem
[1:19:36] to the kingdom of god let's go to james
[1:19:39] chapter one
[1:19:41] hallelujah you learn a lot
[1:19:45] so we need to tweak something a little
[1:19:48] bit before we go up
[1:19:50] james chapter one if you dare you can
[1:19:53] say amen
[1:19:58] james chapter 1 verse 21
[1:20:01] wherefore pages are turning
[1:20:07] james chapter one he comes after hebrew
[1:20:11] wherefore lay a part of fifiness
[1:20:15] and superfluity of naughtiness
[1:20:19] all this territory of the black dog lay
[1:20:22] them as part
[1:20:23] lay them assad and receive
[1:20:27] with meekness the water engrafted word
[1:20:32] everybody clear engrafted word it's a
[1:20:35] word that when it comes in your heart
[1:20:38] it's going to write something it's going
[1:20:41] to imprint something into your heart
[1:20:43] it's going to leave a mark in your heart
[1:20:47] amen it's a living word receive with
[1:20:51] meekness the engrafted word
[1:20:54] which is able to save your brain
[1:20:58] you see where is saving your heart which
[1:21:01] is able to save your soul
[1:21:03] but be you doers of the world
[1:21:07] even though you receive the word don't
[1:21:10] stop them
[1:21:11] amen that word must become life
[1:21:15] in other words you must leave what they
[1:21:18] preach you
[1:21:20] [Music]
[1:21:21] ever clear we didn't preach you to feel
[1:21:24] your brain
[1:21:26] we preach to you so that you can live it
[1:21:31] and when you leave it you become a
[1:21:33] living bible
[1:21:36] [Music]
[1:21:37] ever clear but be your duels of the
[1:21:41] world
[1:21:42] and not water hears only
[1:21:46] deceiving your own water so when you
[1:21:49] listen to the message
[1:21:51] and you don't do what the words say you
[1:21:54] are deceiving not the pastor
[1:21:57] not the deaconer not your wife
[1:22:01] not your husband it's an individual
[1:22:04] affair
[1:22:05] you are deceiving yourself
[1:22:10] hallelujah verse 22 23
[1:22:14] for if any be a healer
[1:22:17] of the word and not a doer he's like a
[1:22:21] man
[1:22:22] beholding his natural face in a glass
[1:22:25] for he behold himself he sees himself
[1:22:29] and goes his way and immediately
[1:22:33] forget what kind of man he was
[1:22:36] if you look at gems here james says that
[1:22:40] when you listen to the word of god
[1:22:43] amen it's like you are standing in front
[1:22:47] of a mirror
[1:22:48] because the word is the mirror the word
[1:22:51] is what is gonna tell you
[1:22:53] how you look before you go on the
[1:22:56] outside
[1:22:58] are you following me and james says that
[1:23:02] when you are listening to the word of
[1:23:03] god the one you see
[1:23:06] in the mirror is not your neighbor
[1:23:13] are you following me so when you come to
[1:23:16] church
[1:23:17] when they begin to preach the word of
[1:23:19] god
[1:23:20] don't be thinking about the next person
[1:23:23] beside you
[1:23:25] don't be thinking about somebody else's
[1:23:28] wife
[1:23:29] don't be thinking about somebody else's

[1:26:40] everybody clear so far so brother
[1:26:42] brother say as long as
[1:26:46] hallelujah by the bottom say as long as
[1:26:50] we do something that is reproachful then
[1:26:53] we are
[1:26:53] indebted to what we are listening to
[1:26:56] god will require of you at first you
[1:27:00] didn't know
[1:27:00] now you know we must live what we
[1:27:03] believe
[1:27:05] and leave it in such a way that it will
[1:27:08] never reproach but reflect
[1:27:12] who jesus christ in all things that we
[1:27:16] do and what
[1:27:18] that's where it is in other words when
[1:27:21] we are preaching the gospel in this
[1:27:23] church
[1:27:24] when you go outside your life
[1:27:27] and your behavior and your conversation
[1:27:31] should reflect exactly what you've been
[1:27:34] preached here
[1:27:38] hallelujah a total deliverance
[1:27:43] brother brown i'm saying the member of
[1:27:46] the church
[1:27:47] he is called to be a member of this
[1:27:50] certain group
[1:27:51] that he will not compromise
[1:27:55] if the church believes that we should
[1:27:58] not
[1:27:58] gamble then that member
[1:28:02] should never touch water
[1:28:05] if your church believes that we don't
[1:28:08] smoke
[1:28:10] if your church does not believe in high
[1:28:13] heels
[1:28:15] if your church does not believe in
[1:28:17] makeup
[1:28:19] if your church does not believe in women
[1:28:21] cutting the hell
[1:28:23] then you make sure in your life at home
[1:28:26] you don't do what you already been told
[1:28:29] [Music]
[1:28:30] we don't believe in drinking he
[1:28:34] the member of that church should turn
[1:28:36] his head
[1:28:37] completely from drinking if we do not
[1:28:40] believe in gambling
[1:28:42] or smoking the member of this church
[1:28:45] should never touch such a thing
[1:28:49] god gives complete deliverance
[1:28:53] he will do it if we shall completely
[1:28:56] surrender ourselves to him if we will
[1:29:00] completely deliver ourself
[1:29:02] into his hand then god can live in us
[1:29:06] christ the hope of glory he can reflect
[1:29:10] himself from us as we get ourself out
[1:29:15] as you put your car in your chair
[1:29:18] and you let god do the work and you just
[1:29:22] surrender
[1:29:23] your life and your self-will you say
[1:29:26] father
[1:29:26] they preach about it i'm struggling with
[1:29:29] it
[1:29:29] it is hard for me but i'm accepting your
[1:29:33] word
[1:29:33] and i'm i'm willingly delivering myself
[1:29:37] into your hand
[1:29:38] if you humble yourself before the word
[1:29:42] then the holy spirit will take over then
[1:29:45] it's not gonna be you
[1:29:46] doing the work but it's gonna be god in
[1:29:49] you
[1:29:50] doing the work and when it's god in you
[1:29:53] doing the work then automatically it's
[1:29:56] going to be reflected
[1:29:57] into the outside by grace are you water
[1:30:02] not of your work but it's a water a gift
[1:30:05] of god ever clear
[1:30:07] then our thoughts are his thoughts
[1:30:10] you want to get to the teleport could
[1:30:13] you imagine cross smoking a cigar
[1:30:16] could you imagine christ drinking
[1:30:19] playing card then if your spirit
[1:30:23] is part of his spirit he wants it to be
[1:30:26] upon your water but you permit
[1:30:29] the devil to come in and take over
[1:30:33] and all the time in your heart way down
[1:30:36] deep you know you are wrong when you do
[1:30:40] those things
[1:30:41] amen inside your heart you know what
[1:30:44] they're preaching is the truth
[1:30:46] and brother branham said the reason why
[1:30:48] you don't want to do it is you have not
[1:30:50] surrendered yet
[1:30:51] you are allowing the devil to come into
[1:30:55] you
[1:30:56] don't blame anybody blame yourself
[1:30:59] for allowing the devil you can just live
[1:31:03] with somebody so long and around them
[1:31:07] until you take up their ways
[1:31:10] if you live with somebody so long
[1:31:13] brother branham said
[1:31:14] automatically you're going to pick up
[1:31:16] the ways how can you live
[1:31:18] so long in the presence of the word
[1:31:22] the living person of christ and you
[1:31:24] don't pick up his ways
[1:31:30] hallelujah and it's good for us
[1:31:34] not to run off and live with the world
[1:31:37] but stay with jesus until we can water
[1:31:41] we fled his life his life be reflected
[1:31:45] in our
[1:31:46] life and that's the way those disciples
[1:31:49] were
[1:31:50] they knew that they had been around
[1:31:53] jesus
[1:31:53] because they talked like him they acted
[1:31:57] like him they healed like him
[1:32:00] and every answer was like who
[1:32:05] they was inspired like him and they
[1:32:08] know that he was living in water so
[1:32:11] there was something about the believer
[1:32:14] that the people who never had an
[1:32:16] experience with jesus christ
[1:32:18] when they contact you they can have a
[1:32:21] feeling
[1:32:22] how jesus behaved they can have a
[1:32:24] feeling how jesus
[1:32:26] talk they can have a feeling how jesus
[1:32:28] react
[1:32:29] they can have a feeling how jesus
[1:32:31] responds because christ is living
[1:32:34] in your life and he's displaying himself
[1:32:37] through you ever clear that is what we
[1:32:41] should be
[1:32:41] all the time as believer
[1:32:44] they acting like him because
[1:32:47] if you associate with someone so long
[1:32:51] guess what you got to pick up his
[1:32:53] behavior
[1:32:54] everybody clear so far praise be the
[1:32:56] name of the lord
[1:32:57] why then we never know just what we are
[1:33:01] doing
[1:33:02] what influence what we are doing is
[1:33:05] having upon others
[1:33:07] the bible said we are written epistle
[1:33:09] read of
[1:33:10] all men that is your life read
[1:33:13] solo to the public until your
[1:33:17] testimony if it's contrary to your life
[1:33:20] is without any water it is
[1:33:23] absolutely impossible for you to go
[1:33:26] through a lot of
[1:33:28] teaching and deep teaching and not
[1:33:30] reflecting that in your life
[1:33:32] there is a blockage somewhere
[1:33:36] amendment it is what you are
[1:33:39] inside of you that people read
[1:33:43] how do people read your insider nobody
[1:33:46] knows what is in the mind
[1:33:48] save the spirit which is in a man but
[1:33:50] for people to reach your inside
[1:33:52] your inside is reflected on the outside
[1:33:55] by your life
[1:33:57] [Music]
[1:34:00] hallelujah not so much what you say
[1:34:04] but what you are you can pin something
[1:34:08] on somebody say
[1:34:09] this is that and so forth but your life
[1:34:12] being different from what they say
[1:34:14] your testimony of your life is louder
[1:34:17] than the testimony
[1:34:18] that someone could say something about
[1:34:21] you
[1:34:22] in other words if somebody gossip about
[1:34:25] you
[1:34:26] you don't have to worry about it that's
[1:34:29] why brother branham said jesus was
[1:34:31] unconscious
[1:34:32] of criticism amen the main thing is make
[1:34:36] sure your life
[1:34:38] is zeroed in with the word and the
[1:34:41] testimony of your life
[1:34:43] will fight everybody that is gossiping
[1:34:46] about you
[1:34:48] if somebody say you stole or you were
[1:34:50] fifa
[1:34:52] and the day they come closer to you and
[1:34:54] they see your life
[1:34:55] and the way they behave you don't have
[1:34:57] to tell them anything
[1:34:59] you will hear them giving you a
[1:35:00] testimony that we heard
[1:35:03] people were talking like this and this
[1:35:05] but when i see you
[1:35:07] i don't see that you're not gonna fight
[1:35:09] they're the one that gonna go back to
[1:35:11] those people
[1:35:12] and say what you told us about that
[1:35:14] brother is wrong
[1:35:15] why do you fight
[1:35:19] amen amen so just keep that on your mind
[1:35:24] that we are bringing influences every
[1:35:27] day and the life that you live
[1:35:29] prove what is on the inside of you you
[1:35:32] cannot change that
[1:35:34] it reflects every person
[1:35:37] reflects outside what is water
[1:35:43] every person ever here
[1:35:46] because amen mordecai which is a type of
[1:35:50] brother branham stood against him
[1:35:53] that is good the first pool stood
[1:35:56] against him and that is good
[1:35:58] the second pool stood against him and
[1:36:01] that weakened him
[1:36:02] but still on the first banquet hammond
[1:36:04] was still there
[1:36:06] and being there happy but something must
[1:36:09] be done
[1:36:10] to destroy that amen to the pentecostal
[1:36:13] church of this day
[1:36:15] the restoration of the gift may lord
[1:36:18] those men maybe some of them present
[1:36:21] here
[1:36:22] some of them hearing the tape around the
[1:36:24] world made the realize
[1:36:26] that this is the calling out of the
[1:36:29] bottom
[1:36:30] not a pentecostal message
[1:36:34] the pentecostal message was to restore
[1:36:37] the gift back to the church
[1:36:39] but this is the calling forth of the
[1:36:42] blood
[1:36:43] another message that was to come just
[1:36:46] before
[1:36:47] sodom was to be burned distraction
[1:36:50] let them understand dear god
[1:36:54] amen you are not called to leave the
[1:36:57] pentecostal message but you are called
[1:37:00] to leave a message
[1:37:01] higher than that
[1:37:02] [Music]
[1:37:04] everybody clear because that's the only
[1:37:07] way that you can destroy that
[1:37:09] man and they're going to cover a face
[1:37:11] his face
[1:37:12] which we're going to see later on in 1st
[1:37:15] timothy chapter 2
[1:37:17] paul says this that in like manner also
[1:37:21] that women not girl adorned themselves
[1:37:26] in modest apparel with shamefulness
[1:37:30] because we know the prostitute is never
[1:37:33] ashamed
[1:37:34] amen so that's why the sister gotta have
[1:37:37] that
[1:37:38] with shame fitness and sobriety
[1:37:41] not with breaded hair or gold or peril
[1:37:44] or cossiere
[1:37:46] we explain to you that brother branham
[1:37:47] told us that all those stuff
[1:37:50] was for the prostitute of the time of
[1:37:52] paul
[1:37:54] in other words the message here is don't
[1:37:57] dress
[1:37:57] like the women of the world that's what
[1:38:00] paul was saying
[1:38:02] amen dress differently than the people
[1:38:06] of the world but
[1:38:09] which becoming women professing
[1:38:13] godliness with good work
[1:38:17] so what paul is saying here we have paul
[1:38:20] and we have peter paul is saying that
[1:38:25] there are women that are professing
[1:38:27] goldiness
[1:38:28] when you meet them they're going to tell
[1:38:30] you i'm a christian
[1:38:32] they will explain to you they will
[1:38:33] express to you that i believe the
[1:38:35] message i'm a christian
[1:38:36] now what paul is saying here is if you
[1:38:40] are
[1:38:40] confessing that you a christian
[1:38:44] you also must dress
[1:38:47] like a christian another one paul
[1:38:50] is talking about the outside appearance
[1:38:56] everybody the way you confess
[1:38:59] all the way you profess is the way you
[1:39:02] should look on the outside
[1:39:06] make sense which becometh to women
[1:39:10] professing godliness with good work
[1:39:13] let the woman learn in silence
[1:39:17] with our subjection
[1:39:20] but i suffer not the woman to do what
[1:39:24] to teach not to do water
[1:39:27] absorb authority over a man
[1:39:31] if you look at paul he's using two words
[1:39:35] number one paul is saying i suffered not
[1:39:38] a woman to teach
[1:39:39] number two paul is saying i suffer her
[1:39:42] to do what
[1:39:44] not to observe authority
[1:39:47] what is paul talking about in the garden
[1:39:50] of heaven
[1:39:52] when god created the men and a woman
[1:39:55] men and women were equal
[1:39:58] [Music]
[1:39:59] about him according to the first
[1:40:03] covenant
[1:40:04] men and women were both equal
[1:40:08] and one man and a woman were equal
[1:40:12] eve taught adam
[1:40:17] i already explained that are you
[1:40:19] following me
[1:40:20] when eve taught adam he calls a chaos
[1:40:24] when sarah taught abraham he caused a
[1:40:28] curse
[1:40:29] so paul is reminding us that
[1:40:32] when a woman and the men were under the
[1:40:36] first covenant amen
[1:40:39] eve taught and caused trouble
[1:40:42] because she didn't understand the way
[1:40:44] she was created
[1:40:45] ever ever clear amen i don't want you
[1:40:50] to repeat that again because in christ
[1:40:53] we are not
[1:40:54] male no female but remember
[1:40:57] don't let the women preach
[1:41:01] [Music]
[1:41:02] you follow me come on you follow me
[1:41:07] teach no to do what
[1:41:10] for you to observe authority you must be
[1:41:14] under authority
[1:41:20] you okay in other words paul moved from
[1:41:24] the first covenant
[1:41:26] into the second covenant
[1:41:30] where god says that the man
[1:41:34] shall rule over the woman and paul say
[1:41:38] in the first covenant even on the second
[1:41:41] covenant
[1:41:42] the woman should not take the pulpit
[1:41:46] i do not tell her to observe authority
[1:41:49] why
[1:41:50] because she's already under the second
[1:41:52] covenant
[1:41:56] i suffer not the woman to teach
[1:41:59] not to observe authority of a man but to
[1:42:02] be in water
[1:42:04] for adam was first formed paul said go
[1:42:07] back to the garden of eden the trail of
[1:42:10] the serpent was hidden right there
[1:42:12] are you there go back to the garden of
[1:42:14] eden adam was first from then who
[1:42:18] and adam was not deceived in other words
[1:42:20] remember
[1:42:21] what happened in the garden of eden amen
[1:42:25] i'm not telling you this just because i
[1:42:27] want to tell you
[1:42:28] but i'm telling you in reference to what
[1:42:31] happened
[1:42:32] in eden because in needham adam was not
[1:42:35] deceived
[1:42:36] but the woman being deceived was in the
[1:42:38] water
[1:42:39] notwithstanding she shall be saved in
[1:42:41] water
[1:42:42] he was formed it was the woman deceived
[1:42:45] but she shall be saved in what
[1:42:47] in child bearing white child bearing
[1:42:50] because when the curse came
[1:42:52] on the woman not only was she put
[1:42:55] under men for protection
[1:42:58] but god gave the problem on the
[1:43:01] conception
[1:43:03] that's why paul keep the line
[1:43:07] so when you read the scripture you need
[1:43:09] a prophet
[1:43:10] amen an adam was not deceived by the
[1:43:13] woman being deceived
[1:43:14] was in a transgression notwithstanding
[1:43:17] she shall be saved in water
[1:43:19] i'm going i'm putting the woman back
[1:43:21] again to the position that god put her
[1:43:24] in the garden of eden in shortbearing if
[1:43:27] they continue
[1:43:28] in the water and charity and holiness
[1:43:31] with what
[1:43:32] sobriety that was paul watch peter now
[1:43:37] peter say likewise you wife
[1:43:41] be in subjection to your own husband
[1:43:43] same thing paul said
[1:43:45] that if any obey not they also
[1:43:48] may without the word be warned by the
[1:43:51] conversation of the wives
[1:43:53] why the behold your chest conversation
[1:43:57] if you look in here he's talking about
[1:43:59] the life
[1:44:01] couple we feel who's adorning
[1:44:05] let it be not let it not be
[1:44:08] that outward adorning of playing of the
[1:44:12] air
[1:44:13] and wearing of gold and putting on off
[1:44:15] water
[1:44:17] but let it be off the water paul
[1:44:21] was talking about the outside appearance
[1:44:25] about what you confess what you profess
[1:44:28] you must look like that but now when
[1:44:30] peter comes
[1:44:32] peter is talking about the inside man
[1:44:37] anybody here one is talking about the
[1:44:41] appearance
[1:44:42] that somebody see another one put the
[1:44:45] accent
[1:44:46] not on the appearance but peter is
[1:44:48] telling you that
[1:44:49] the beginning is in the heart paul is
[1:44:52] saying
[1:44:52] fix your outside peter say before you
[1:44:55] get on the outside
[1:44:56] start first from the inside
[1:45:02] he said who's adorning let it be not on
[1:45:06] the outward
[1:45:06] that's what paul was talking about i
[1:45:09] don't think of the planning of her
[1:45:11] or the wearing of god or the putting on
[1:45:13] of her peril but
[1:45:15] in that which is not water in other
[1:45:18] words peter is not focusing on this
[1:45:21] i'm focusing on the character even the
[1:45:24] ornament
[1:45:26] of a milk and a quiet water in the heart
[1:45:29] the meek is the lamb which is in the
[1:45:32] sight of god
[1:45:33] of a great person for after this manner
[1:45:37] in the old time the holy women also who
[1:45:40] trusted in god
[1:45:41] i don't themself being in what
[1:45:44] suggestion
[1:45:46] unto their own they always kept their
[1:45:49] place
[1:45:50] of protection because god gave
[1:45:53] a woman to be under a man not for abuse
[1:45:56] but for protection but the main thing
[1:45:59] peter is saying
[1:46:01] watch the inside work on the inside
[1:46:05] more than anything paul say work on the
[1:46:08] outside
[1:46:08] because the inside the outside always
[1:46:11] reflect the
[1:46:12] inside you got the two of them where are
[1:46:15] you going now
[1:46:16] praise be the name of the lord now let's
[1:46:19] sword
[1:46:21] hallelujah i always
[1:46:24] have been accused of being hard on a
[1:46:26] sister
[1:46:27] about wearing barber and manicure
[1:46:30] all over their face and stuff i have
[1:46:33] always been accused of being hard honest
[1:46:35] our sisters
[1:46:36] it is not that i got anything against
[1:46:38] that i
[1:46:40] don't say the woman is not a good woman
[1:46:42] that she's some street walker or
[1:46:44] something
[1:46:45] that is not my attitude but it is this
[1:46:48] when she puts so much artificial
[1:46:52] on the outside it shows that there is a
[1:46:55] lot
[1:46:55] artificial on water inside
[1:46:59] where he o ought to be filled up with
[1:47:01] what
[1:47:02] with christ because the outside always
[1:47:06] express what is water by the fruit you
[1:47:10] know them
[1:47:11] that's exactly what i have been saying
[1:47:13] here all along
[1:47:15] everybody clear so far we found many
[1:47:18] women in these days
[1:47:20] thirst for beauty it's a natural thing
[1:47:23] for a woman to test to be pretty that is
[1:47:26] her god give an
[1:47:27] instinct her beauty that god gave her
[1:47:30] for her mate
[1:47:31] and now we found out that women want to
[1:47:34] be that way
[1:47:35] why is it it's just because it's
[1:47:37] something god gave her
[1:47:39] it is not wrong for a woman to be pretty
[1:47:42] there should be
[1:47:43] now the true touch that a woman should
[1:47:45] have
[1:47:46] paul now peter the true touch that a
[1:47:50] woman should have
[1:47:51] will be to adorn themselves in modest
[1:47:55] apparel
[1:47:55] and have water while the problem say
[1:47:59] what a woman need is to help paul
[1:48:03] and peter together
[1:48:06] you follow me now adorned themselves
[1:48:09] with a modest apparel
[1:48:10] power but to have a christ-like spirit
[1:48:14] peter in other words combine
[1:48:17] paul and peter first timothy 2 9
[1:48:21] da now that is the way the woman should
[1:48:23] touch to be
[1:48:24] now if you want to be pretty that's the
[1:48:27] way what makes you pray
[1:48:28] see it is a water a christ-like spirit
[1:48:32] peter
[1:48:32] and i'm done in water go
[1:48:36] by peter first then you can get paul
[1:48:39] if you get paul first you under
[1:48:44] legalistic
[1:48:46] are you there if you fix your outside
[1:48:50] clothing without fixing your heart
[1:48:53] you're gonna leave a hard battle
[1:48:57] and you're gonna wait for somebody to
[1:49:00] get you off the message
[1:49:05] because you have been living in a prison
[1:49:08] you are trying to block the black dog
[1:49:11] and it never work so when a preacher
[1:49:14] comes
[1:49:15] and free you automatically you go back
[1:49:18] to the mire that you came out of it
[1:49:21] because you try to go by paul without
[1:49:24] peter
[1:49:24] you go by peter first you fix your
[1:49:28] heart then you don't have to worry about
[1:49:30] paul
[1:49:32] [Music]
[1:49:34] anybody clear so far we talk about
[1:49:38] the women wearing high heels we talked
[1:49:40] about the women wearing tight
[1:49:43] clothes that what that expresses their
[1:49:46] their form what about the
[1:49:49] skirt hallelujah
[1:49:53] the most ungodly thing
[1:49:57] trying to advertise skirt for women
[1:50:00] say show every move of their body
[1:50:04] god making a woman such as i
[1:50:07] think that she is a woman is not a law
[1:50:10] creature remember that we already
[1:50:11] explained you that
[1:50:13] and who degrade her mind when god put a
[1:50:16] sheepskin
[1:50:17] over remember genesis to do what
[1:50:21] to hide her so the covering of the lamb
[1:50:24] was to conceal or to hide
[1:50:26] you already know that and she wanted a
[1:50:28] knitted dress
[1:50:30] to show every form of her body
[1:50:33] now ladies i want you to forgive me i
[1:50:35] don't want to hurt your feeling
[1:50:37] i'm not here to hurt your feeling god
[1:50:39] knows it's not
[1:50:40] but i'm here as a gospel preacher to let
[1:50:43] you know
[1:50:44] what is truth then you do it whatever
[1:50:47] you wish to then when you got to doing
[1:50:49] those things
[1:50:50] you shall be you shall begin to reason
[1:50:53] if this woman can do it
[1:50:55] she is a well thought of she goes to
[1:50:57] church she lives in the rank of society
[1:51:00] why can't i do it that's reasoning when
[1:51:03] your soul tells you
[1:51:04] it is water so regardless of whose
[1:51:07] sister is doing what
[1:51:09] you stay with the world everybody clear
[1:51:13] god cover women up and
[1:51:16] man up not only women and men
[1:51:19] up in the garden of eden we already went
[1:51:22] there
[1:51:23] never strip them see but it is reasoning
[1:51:28] you shall reason it out the rest of them
[1:51:30] are
[1:51:31] doing it where are we getting it
[1:51:34] okay in darkest south africa when i see
[1:51:38] women standing there stark
[1:51:40] naked as they came into the world
[1:51:43] and when the holy spirit came on them
[1:51:46] there
[1:51:46] to hide the water
[1:51:50] they folded the water and walked away
[1:51:54] till they could find some water
[1:51:56] brother branham was preaching and the
[1:51:59] women were bare chested
[1:52:02] and when the holy spirit came down
[1:52:04] automatically the women
[1:52:06] folded their arm and they ran away to
[1:52:08] get clothing
[1:52:09] so if you have a problem covering your
[1:52:12] chest
[1:52:13] you need to go back to the altar i'm not
[1:52:16] dealing with the chest
[1:52:17] you already know you gotta cover it and
[1:52:19] then they call
[1:52:21] us the civilization and each year
[1:52:24] we are taking off more clothes and then
[1:52:26] claim to have the holy spirit
[1:52:28] the holy spirit will work on one person
[1:52:31] one way
[1:52:32] and on another another way
[1:52:36] if the holy spirit comes on you whether
[1:52:39] you are black or white
[1:52:41] whether you are chinese or whichever
[1:52:44] category you wonder
[1:52:45] you want to behave the same

[1:53:05] that is expressing the form of our body
[1:53:09] the shape of our body we must stick to
[1:53:11] avoid that

[2:08:34] fashioned
[2:08:35] the clothing of the king must do it
[2:08:39] with another wisdom because adam
[2:08:43] fashioned his own clothing with the
[2:08:45] wisdom
[2:08:46] of the devil using fig leaves

[2:09:35] ghost
[2:09:38] because it's a cloth that's gonna be
[2:09:41] given to a priest
[2:09:44] and that cloth must reflect the beauty
[2:09:47] of god
[2:09:48] and the glory of god

[2:18:21] beautiful
[2:18:22] it's for god's glory not going looking
[2:18:25] crazy
[2:18:27] are you there so right here
[2:18:31] we found out that the priests have a
[2:18:34] robe
[2:18:35] and that rob that we see
[2:18:39] it is getting from the neck of the
[2:18:41] priest
[2:18:43] all the way to the feet it is a rob
[2:18:46] that is covering his entire body
[2:18:50] everybody follow me that's the robe of
[2:18:52] the priest
[2:18:53] let's jump to verse 42. let me see my
[2:18:56] time
[2:18:57] we good are you there
[2:19:00] verse 42 and you shall
[2:19:03] make damn water
[2:19:07] bridges are under
[2:19:10] you know what a bridge is right right
[2:19:13] under
[2:19:14] cover underneath clothes
[2:19:18] so the priest had two clothing
[2:19:22] the priest had a robot which was enough
[2:19:25] sad clothes
[2:19:29] are you there and the priests have also
[2:19:33] a bridge
[2:19:35] or an underneath close
[2:19:41] amen
[2:19:45] i'm going to say it later amen
[2:19:49] and you shall make them line and bridges
[2:19:52] to cover the water
[2:19:56] so the bridges are the underneath clubs
[2:20:01] god wanted to cover
[2:20:04] the nakedness that started down
[2:20:07] on the top you already should be covered
[2:20:11] but where life started where the problem
[2:20:15] was
[2:20:16] in the garden of eden what caused the
[2:20:19] fall
[2:20:20] now god is dealing with it
[2:20:27] hallelujah and you shall make them
[2:20:30] learning bridges
[2:20:32] to cover the water in the garden of eden
[2:20:36] god cover the nakedness
[2:20:39] now god is very specific remember
[2:20:42] i'm not dealing with the top we're
[2:20:44] dealing with your skirt
[2:20:48] amen to cover
[2:20:51] not to fit
[2:20:56] not to fit not from feeding
[2:21:00] but covering it to cover
[2:21:03] your nakedness from the water
[2:21:08] even to the water where brother greg
[2:21:11] got the mail
[2:21:15] amen
[2:21:19] from their loins even to the
[2:21:23] thai they saw water
[2:21:26] so right here god says
[2:21:30] the robe goes from the top all the way
[2:21:33] to the bottom
[2:21:34] but the bridges will go from the lawns
[2:21:40] all the way to the time
[2:21:48] you follow me from that if we don't
[2:21:51] teach this
[2:21:52] we're going to be legalistic
[2:21:54] [Music]
[2:21:56] now don't say they told me in the
[2:21:58] message we don't do this
[2:21:59] the scripture says brother branham say
[2:22:02] the scripture says
[2:22:03] brother branham say the scriptures say
[2:22:05] what branham says
[2:22:06] then it's not going to be your pastor
[2:22:09] it's going to be the word of god
[2:22:11] because the message came out of the
[2:22:13] bible
[2:22:15] are you there the clothing
[2:22:18] start from the loins
[2:22:22] all the way to water to the side
[2:22:26] to go to water so according to god
[2:22:38] did you get it according to god
[2:22:42] when you begin to deal with the lower
[2:22:45] part
[2:22:46] god is more interested that you
[2:22:50] cover a certain portion
[2:22:56] that he's considering on the lower part
[2:22:59] as what
[2:23:02] because that's where causes the scene
[2:23:07] which height of skirt should you wear
[2:23:14] which heart which height
[2:23:19] if somebody put a skirt here is he wrong
[2:23:22] if they put the skirt here is he wrong
[2:23:24] if they put a skirt here is there wrong
[2:23:30] let me start it again somebody missed
[2:23:33] the
[2:23:34] the lesson if somebody put a skirt here
[2:23:36] they're wrong
[2:23:37] if somebody put the skirt here they're
[2:23:39] wrong if somebody put the skirt here
[2:23:41] they're wrong
[2:23:42] if somebody put the skirt here they're
[2:23:44] wrong
[2:23:59] brother branham did you teach something
[2:24:02] like this in the message
[2:24:07] hallelujah in the message
[2:24:14] brother problem say the underneath
[2:24:17] government in palestine
[2:24:21] closes at the what why did he learn that
[2:24:30] where did brother branham learn it why
[2:24:33] did brother branham says that
[2:24:35] did he give you a scripture was brother
[2:24:39] branham lying
[2:24:40] again in this church the message and the
[2:24:44] bible are
[2:24:46] perfectly in line
[2:24:49] you are not feeding upon the word of men
[2:24:52] you are feeding upon the unfailing by
[2:24:56] the word of the
[2:24:57] son of man he's just using my voice but
[2:25:00] the one talking
[2:25:01] is him why did brother branham says
[2:25:05] the underneath government the breaches
[2:25:09] stood closest at the what why did he
[2:25:13] learn that
[2:25:14] go search the message
[2:25:18] go home and do what
[2:25:24] the underneath government in palestine
[2:25:27] closes at the water so not only was the
[2:25:31] priest
[2:25:32] dressing like that but the entire
[2:25:36] palestine was dressing like that
[2:25:40] because god wants the whole kingdom to
[2:25:43] be like priests
[2:25:46] the underneath government in palestine
[2:25:49] closes at the knee
[2:25:51] and then the word
[2:25:56] everybody clear and then the robe goes
[2:25:59] over there
[2:26:04] in the message and welcome christ now
[2:26:07] the palestinian government underneath
[2:26:11] it fits just above the water
[2:26:14] and the robe went under
[2:26:17] the unwelcome cross and the palestinian
[2:26:20] government come
[2:26:21] down as a water the outside but the
[2:26:24] underneath garment button just below the
[2:26:27] work
[2:26:29] any question
[2:26:33] but in the washing of jesus feet
[2:26:37] the palestinian government has an
[2:26:39] underneath government
[2:26:41] and then they rob over that the
[2:26:43] palestinian government is down to the
[2:26:45] knee
[2:26:46] physically he did not feel it the
[2:26:49] palestinian government is what
[2:26:52] [Music]
[2:26:56] this rub must be loose
[2:27:02] not tight
[2:27:06] the palestinian government is a loose
[2:27:10] government
[2:27:10] and they have underneath government that
[2:27:13] goes down about
[2:27:16] that's why you hear brother brad i'm
[2:27:19] saying that
[2:27:20] it is coming from the scripture
[2:27:24] even jesus christ have to garment
[2:27:31] in john 19 then the soldiers
[2:27:34] when they had crucified jesus took his
[2:27:37] water
[2:27:39] and made how many parts the roman
[2:27:42] soldier divided the garment of jesus in
[2:27:45] full part
[2:27:48] that was the outside garment
[2:27:53] everybody clear but look at the inside
[2:27:55] garment
[2:27:57] to every soldier apart how many soldiers
[2:28:00] were there
[2:28:06] and also he's what there was a second
[2:28:10] government
[2:28:10] that was under it was called his coat
[2:28:14] a cotton was without water
[2:28:18] woven from the water throughout
[2:28:22] so jesus had two government but the
[2:28:25] first
[2:28:26] one the outside was divided
[2:28:29] in four by four roman soldier but the
[2:28:32] inside was never touched
[2:28:36] everybody because the roman
[2:28:39] spirit came according to the teaching of
[2:28:42] the seven church churches
[2:28:44] the roman spirit attacked the church and
[2:28:47] they fall
[2:28:47] cavalier
[2:28:51] are you there and when jesus sits on the
[2:28:54] throne
[2:28:55] he also have four caribbeans
[2:28:58] so the outside government have to be
[2:29:01] attacked by four soldiers
[2:29:02] because four caribbean will react
[2:29:05] against the soldier
[2:29:07] when he come as a white horse rather
[2:29:09] than
[2:29:10] the anointing of a lion move he come as
[2:29:13] a red horse rather
[2:29:14] than the bulls move he come as a black
[2:29:17] horse rather
[2:29:18] than the men move and the last is a
[2:29:20] flying ego
[2:29:21] that's why they have to divide it in
[2:29:23] four parts that's the outside
[2:29:25] but there is sad they could not touch it
[2:29:28] because it's the person
[2:29:29] of jesus christ
[2:29:36] are you there mark chapter 14
[2:29:40] and there follow him as certain man
[2:29:44] when they catch jesus christ there was a
[2:29:47] young man that was following them
[2:29:50] the bible said death was following a
[2:29:52] certain man
[2:29:53] having a line and clothes cast about his
[2:29:57] what
[2:29:59] in other words he didn't have the
[2:30:02] breaches
[2:30:05] and the young man laid hard on him
[2:30:08] and he left his water and fled from damn
[2:30:12] water
[2:30:13] this is a person who didn't wear
[2:30:16] his clothes appropriately
[2:30:19] [Music]
[2:30:25] i hope the holy spirit is talking to you
[2:30:27] never do that
[2:30:30] never do that that's why certain stuff
[2:30:35] from victoria's secret devil
[2:30:48] i hope you got it so according to the
[2:30:52] scripture
[2:30:53] this part is god is calling that
[2:30:56] nakedness

[2:33:00] uncomfort your locks come on make
[2:33:03] bad what
[2:33:07] if you notice when we say leg we usually
[2:33:11] say from here
[2:33:12] all the way there that's my leg but look
[2:33:15] how the scripture is
[2:33:16] changing uncomfortable the leg
[2:33:21] number one come on and uncover the what
[2:33:27] now if you notice the scripture
[2:33:31] is calling this the time
[2:33:34] makes sense and this is the what
[2:33:38] so the scriptures say take off her robe
[2:33:42] when you take off her rob she's going to
[2:33:44] uncover
[2:33:45] the leg
[2:33:48] makes sense but her tie is still
[2:33:53] covered now remove her tie
[2:33:56] what is going to come out of it watch
[2:33:59] the scripture
[2:34:01] uncover the tide pass over the river
[2:34:05] your water you see now
[2:34:09] you see now your nakedness shall be
[2:34:13] uncovered why because the tie is off
[2:34:17] makes sense now your nakedness shall be
[2:34:20] uncovered
[2:34:21] yeah your shame remembering the garden
[2:34:24] of eden
[2:34:25] when they were naked they were not
[2:34:27] ashamed when the nakedness open up then
[2:34:29] they will shape the two gods together
[2:34:35] amen and your shame shall be seen
[2:34:38] i will take vengeance i will not meet
[2:34:41] you i'll meet you
[2:34:42] as a man so now we clearly see from the
[2:34:46] scripture
[2:34:47] that this part here according to god on
[2:34:50] the lower part
[2:34:51] this from here all the way there god
[2:34:54] doesn't want it outside
[2:34:57] we clear sister
[2:35:02] hallelujah naom chapter 5
[2:35:05] behold i may guess this say the lord of
[2:35:07] hosts
[2:35:08] and i will discover that what
[2:35:12] now we are talking about skirt you okay
[2:35:14] now
[2:35:15] i will discover that skirt
[2:35:18] a bird upon the water and i will shut
[2:35:22] the nest under water
[2:35:24] so when the skirt goes up
[2:35:27] it is exposing something god called
[2:35:30] nakedness
[2:35:33] and the kingdom that shame jeremiah 13
[2:35:36] verse 28 therefore without discover that
[2:35:40] what
[2:35:41] upon that that's what marilyn monroe did
[2:35:44] when
[2:35:45] she stood under a ventilator you saw her
[2:35:48] hoarding and her it's
[2:35:51] devil demonic
[2:35:54] that's what the scripture is talking
[2:35:55] about and they put that as a big statute
[2:35:59] of marilyn monroe
[2:36:02] going against the scripture
[2:36:08] we not discover the skirt upon their
[2:36:11] face
[2:36:11] and the shell may have what appeared
[2:36:14] isaiah 20 so shall the king of assyria
[2:36:19] lead the way the who
[2:36:21] the egyptian prisoner and the etopian
[2:36:24] captive
[2:36:25] young and old naked and how
[2:36:29] even with the bad acts uncovered to the
[2:36:33] what
[2:36:34] so god is descriptive here
[2:36:37] showing that you must cover your back
[2:36:41] that's why some of victoria's secrets
[2:36:44] suffer from the devil
[2:36:50] you can wear an underneath clothes that
[2:36:51] only cover in the front
[2:36:56] i totally clearly explained it so you
[2:36:58] won't think twice what i was talking
[2:37:00] about
[2:37:02] everybody clear brother branham says
[2:37:05] this
[2:37:06] here what has stripper women it's

[2:37:34] to come down there i shall move to
[2:37:37] florida if it is

[2:39:29] god said if you will make me an altar
[2:39:32] of stone you shall not build
[2:39:36] built it of union stone god doesn't want
[2:39:39] anybody to work on it
[2:39:40] for if you lift up your tool upon it
[2:39:44] you have polluted it in other words you
[2:39:47] want to make
[2:39:48] god an altar just take the stone and put
[2:39:50] it as natural
[2:39:52] as they can be don't artificial workout

[2:40:00] neither shall you go up by steps
[2:40:04] to my water an altar

[2:40:14] neither shall you go in the church you
[2:40:17] see me i gave you that before
[2:40:19] neither shall you go up by steps to my
[2:40:22] altar
[2:40:24] that's your water be not water
[2:40:29] discover they're wrong
[2:40:32] so god says when you even building my
[2:40:35] temple
[2:40:37] i don't want you to build temple like
[2:40:39] hidden
[2:40:41] because the temple you're gonna go way
[2:40:43] up
[2:40:44] because i don't want when you are
[2:40:47] worshiping me
[2:40:48] i don't want you to expose your
[2:40:50] nakedness
[2:40:54] you follow me in other words you should
[2:40:57] never
[2:40:57] come in the house of god with a cloth
[2:41:02] that exposes your nakedness
[2:41:06] you should not have a cloth that when
[2:41:09] you worship
[2:41:10] god when it goes up we see your
[2:41:14] nakedness
[2:41:17] make sure you have a cloth no matter how
[2:41:20] you dance in the spirit
[2:41:22] no matter what you do in the spirit your
[2:41:24] cloth
[2:41:25] is still protecting you and not showing
[2:41:28] your nakedness
[2:41:36] brother branham i was preaching here in
[2:41:38] phoenix not long ago
[2:41:40] on something like that the minister's
[2:41:43] wife sitting on the pulpit
[2:41:45] with one of these boys bob hair all
[2:41:47] kinked up
[2:41:49] and with a dress that she could even
[2:41:52] knead she could even keep her
[2:41:55] underneath skirt from shannon
[2:41:59] in the tree couldn't death down
[2:42:02] over her what in other words your dress
[2:42:06] when you are sitting a sister
[2:42:09] your dress must still cover your knee
[2:42:13] when you are sitting because when you
[2:42:16] expose your tower
[2:42:17] you are exposing your nakedness god
[2:42:20] doesn't want us to see your knees
[2:42:27] how high should be your skirt put your
[2:42:31] surgery on your skirt at home
[2:42:33] go ahead and sit down and watch how your
[2:42:36] skirt goes up
[2:42:38] if you're knees are still
[2:42:41] covered you got a thicker inspection
[2:42:46] if it's not if your knee begins to show
[2:42:48] up
[2:42:49] take it out you are already exposing
[2:42:53] your nakedness
[2:42:58] everybody clear how high should be your
[2:43:01] dress
[2:43:03] any more questions
[2:43:09] that she could not even keep could not
[2:43:12] get
[2:43:13] over her knee about four or five
[2:43:16] inches above her knee sitting up there
[2:43:19] jumping up and down leading song
[2:43:24] in other words she we are display we
[2:43:26] have been put on a show of
[2:43:28] nakedness
[2:43:31] in vain do they worship
[2:43:37] in vain
[2:43:40] i blasted it just as hard as i could
[2:43:44] he won't invite me back i don't expect
[2:43:47] to
[2:43:48] but he knows what is right and wrong
[2:43:50] when i stand at the judgment
[2:43:52] it is not on my hand anymore
[2:43:55] some of those women on the platform with
[2:43:58] their dresses above their knees
[2:44:00] why keep brother branham keep using that
[2:44:03] for reference
[2:44:06] now when you read the message it's going
[2:44:07] to make sense all over the message
[2:44:11] above the knee and cut somewhat
[2:44:14] and show what because those dress must
[2:44:18] be loose what
[2:44:22] loose every move
[2:44:25] they make and they're underneath clothes
[2:44:30] what
[2:44:32] don't do that sister don't do that
[2:44:36] just as bad as wearing water
[2:44:40] or bikini or anything else in other
[2:44:43] words your long
[2:44:44] dress that you're doing is nothing we
[2:44:46] can see everything
[2:44:48] the purpose was for you to cover now we
[2:44:50] can see it it doesn't matter how
[2:44:52] long your dress is
[2:44:57] you pentecostal brand loud audition
[2:44:59] preacher
[2:45:00] how long will god suffer you i don't
[2:45:03] know
[2:45:04] god be merciful to your blind eyes he's
[2:45:06] got i
[2:45:07] served tonight to open your eyes that
[2:45:09] you might
[2:45:10] see let me head to the airport
[2:45:14] brother branham what do you think about
[2:45:17] our sister in the church
[2:45:18] wearing such short dresses doesn't it
[2:45:22] mar our testimony and set a wrong
[2:45:25] example for our young people
[2:45:26] in our world in our church
[2:45:30] to see a grown woman wearing a dress
[2:45:34] so short that he shows her what
[2:45:37] when she water so when you put your
[2:45:40] dress at home
[2:45:42] not only do you sit for your inspection
[2:45:45] you gotta stand and walk back and forth
[2:45:48] and make sure when you walk back and
[2:45:51] forth your knee doesn't show
[2:45:55] any question
[2:45:58] the bible says what abraham is saying
[2:46:04] ever who you are sister or brother
[2:46:06] whoever is this
[2:46:08] i what with you what
[2:46:12] it is a what a disgrace for a sister
[2:46:16] while she's walking
[2:46:17] her knees are showing
[2:46:21] because according to god in the
[2:46:23] scripture
[2:46:24] from here all the way to the knee which
[2:46:27] is the end of your tie bone
[2:46:30] it must it's called is considered
[2:46:32] nakedness
[2:46:35] but tell me what to do about them i
[2:46:37] preach it just as hard as i know how to
[2:46:40] preach
[2:46:40] they do it the same so it is their water
[2:46:44] because the word went forth like i did
[2:46:46] it today
[2:46:47] i'm certainly against them all skin
[2:46:50] tight dress that look i constantly
[2:46:53] fasted my kids becky and sarah
[2:46:56] i don't care how little they are so
[2:46:59] start when they're younger
[2:47:01] i just fasted him all the time
[2:47:05] start when they're younger
[2:47:06] [Music]
[2:47:08] because kids you can expect that that
[2:47:12] in kids you have to correct them but
[2:47:14] when it comes to a woman there is
[2:47:15] something wrong because you already
[2:47:17] grown up
[2:47:18] you should know better ever clear
[2:47:22] oh my god make sure
[2:47:26] yo you are properly orderly
[2:47:29] dressed from here all the way there
[2:47:33] and if you go down that's still correct
[2:47:36] because the knees are protected
[2:47:39] everybody clear
[2:47:41] anybody clear why do we wear skirt down
[2:47:45] long
[2:47:45] you got talking to them they kind of
[2:47:48] give you a shoulder
[2:47:49] isn't that right they know that's right
[2:47:51] if there is a lady in them
[2:47:53] they know that's what but you see they
[2:47:55] can't humble themselves to that
[2:47:57] women has become so densely feminist and
[2:48:00] so far more attractive
[2:48:02] and what is it they dress themselves
[2:48:04] more attractive
[2:48:05] the women used to wear what
[2:48:09] flowing and what ah
[2:48:12] brother stephen you have not touched the
[2:48:14] sleeve and
[2:48:16] sleeves and long water and heat their
[2:48:19] water
[2:48:20] because they didn't want men to last for
[2:48:22] them
[2:48:25] no tight watch what the scripture says
[2:48:29] now
[2:48:30] we live here but we are not american we
[2:48:33] are christian
[2:48:34] our kingdom is from above is of above
[2:48:37] if our life comes from up there then we
[2:48:40] act like it
[2:48:41] because our life is from a holy place
[2:48:44] a holy nation it looks different and he
[2:48:48] dresses how
[2:48:49] the women up there has water
[2:48:52] and they don't wear manicure on their
[2:48:54] face and they don't wear
[2:48:56] shorts they wear skirt and long rope and
[2:49:00] water
[2:49:01] and they have long rare the nature of it
[2:49:03] from up there
[2:49:04] reflect back on us in other words the
[2:49:06] way you dress here you are reflecting
[2:49:08] your theophany
[2:49:13] let me finish this but stephen please
[2:49:16] touch the sleeve
[2:49:19] now first question i pull out here
[2:49:21] brother branham
[2:49:22] is he wrong for a christian to put her
[2:49:25] hair
[2:49:26] in the pinker we already discussed this
[2:49:28] also

[2:54:49] you ready many times
[2:54:52] people misjudge one another
[2:54:55] and it's a bad thing to do you say why
[2:54:59] she got shorter she's wearing her
[2:55:02] dresses
[2:55:03] too short that is not the holy spirit
[2:55:06] upon her
[2:55:09] don't do that don't do that
[2:55:13] that is not right you don't know what is
[2:55:16] in that woman's heart
[2:55:18] you don't know nothing about it you know
[2:55:21] that the holy spirit would make her
[2:55:23] conduct herself a little better
[2:55:25] that may be true but i tell you as long
[2:55:28] as i
[2:55:29] you and i let god do the judging of that
[2:55:33] let you and i just pray for that person
[2:55:37] that god will show them the water
[2:55:40] here some time ago a man met me out here
[2:55:44] and i had a pianist here that had a
[2:55:47] little short
[2:55:48] little skirt and was not just
[2:55:51] exactly i guess just right the lady
[2:55:55] had shot her and she was here
[2:55:59] in the she was uh
[2:56:04] sometimes somebody might be new in a
[2:56:06] message
[2:56:08] they don't know any better
[2:56:11] be careful they have accepted the
[2:56:13] message
[2:56:14] they're still going through the cleanup
[2:56:18] some of you were in the former church
[2:56:20] that we were
[2:56:22] but you were not in the message
[2:56:27] you were going to the message church
[2:56:30] but you were not in the message yet
[2:56:33] now that these things begin to unfold to
[2:56:36] you
[2:56:37] you are like a baby in the message
[2:56:44] and a man met me out there and just tear
[2:56:48] me to pieces
[2:56:49] he said you were pentecostal preacher
[2:56:51] you let that woman sit up there
[2:56:53] that short hair just going on like
[2:56:55] everything the men begin to bow brother
[2:56:57] brother
[2:56:59] listen to brother brahma well i say
[2:57:02] i think the woman has a god has a good
[2:57:05] spirit in her
[2:57:06] i certainly do not agree with that you
[2:57:09] know the skirt part up there
[2:57:11] the two pieces brother branham didn't
[2:57:13] condone
[2:57:14] with her dressing brother branham still
[2:57:16] condemned the dressing
[2:57:18] but brother branham was looking at her
[2:57:20] as a newborn
[2:57:22] in the way one of them
[2:57:25] is down here and one canned up here it's
[2:57:28] a shirt like the way
[2:57:30] and it's real thin and show the
[2:57:31] underneath government
[2:57:33] that they had around that should not be
[2:57:35] done i don't like that i don't really
[2:57:37] don't
[2:57:38] they might be just as spirit-filled as
[2:57:40] anybody else
[2:57:42] i don't know god knows that but i would
[2:57:44] not condemn that woman and say that she
[2:57:46] was going to hell
[2:57:48] by the side this same person
[2:57:51] that was condemning god brother had in
[2:57:54] his
[2:57:54] church a lady who had
[2:57:58] and war water and a temper enough to
[2:58:02] fight a bar song
[2:58:06] she had a lady that was living
[2:58:09] poor but was not leaving peter
[2:58:16] outside she was good but the heart was
[2:58:19] bad
[2:58:20] [Music]
[2:58:22] enough temper to fight the basso and
[2:58:25] just as what
[2:58:26] as mean as she could be now long hair
[2:58:30] and long skirt don't take you to heaven
[2:58:32] it doesn't mean you don't wear long hair
[2:58:35] but if your character is wrong with your
[2:58:38] long dresses you going to hell
[2:58:42] no sir it's the water that is in you
[2:58:46] take you to water
[2:58:47] that character and this is the end
[2:58:51] then you should remember that many
[2:58:53] pastors don't mention those things
[2:58:55] and the people just automatically go on
[2:58:58] think it's all right but a pastor should
[2:59:00] really tear into it
[2:59:02] that's what i'm doing and then the
[2:59:04] sister of the church
[2:59:06] those sisters who are in water
[2:59:11] wearing their clothes how they should be
[2:59:15] example of what and what
[2:59:18] and what i think that any woman that is
[2:59:22] motherly
[2:59:23] and godly and sisterly ought to go to
[2:59:27] such a person
[2:59:28] and with water not
[2:59:32] arrogant just sit
[2:59:35] down and talk to that lady and if she is
[2:59:38] of god the holy spirit will
[2:59:41] understand those things and she shall
[2:59:44] correct
[2:59:44] how but when you will quickly condemn
[2:59:48] her
[2:59:49] and drive her away you might harm that
[2:59:52] young
[2:59:53] born baby i will knock on condemn
[2:59:56] that person how long
[2:59:59] should your dress be make sure
[3:00:03] your knee when you sit when you walk
[3:00:06] when you jump we don't see your knee
[3:00:08] your knees let your husband see it
[3:00:12] hey how long should your sleeve be
[3:00:16] check with the spirit on you make sure
[3:00:19] when you wear your sleeve
[3:00:21] do this do that make sure nobody sees
[3:00:24] what is going on
[3:00:26] everybody clear if you see somebody
[3:00:28] struggling
[3:00:30] before you talk to him check your heart
[3:00:33] if you have a jealousy spirit a mean
[3:00:36] spirit
[3:00:36] a bad spirit a spirit that wants to
[3:00:39] fight
[3:00:40] a legalistic spirit don't go correct to
[3:00:42] that lady
[3:00:43] come and talk to the deacon let me go
[3:00:46] handle it
[3:00:47] because i'm a pastor but if you are
[3:00:49] sweet you yourself are an example
[3:00:52] and you dress nicely and you have a nice
[3:00:54] sweet spirit
[3:00:55] then you can approach that young sister
[3:00:57] or that young
[3:00:58] person or that baby in the gospel it
[3:01:01] with respect
[3:01:02] and talk to her so that the holy spirit
[3:01:04] can show her the light that you already
[3:01:07] have seen all mine's clear let's stand
[3:01:17] lord willie we're going to head to 45
[3:01:21] let's pray
[3:01:25] heavenly father lord we are approaching
[3:01:27] you again humbly
[3:01:29] father this afternoon thanking you for
[3:01:32] everything
[3:01:34] lord when we are confronted with
[3:01:36] questions
[3:01:38] pastor how long should be our dress or
[3:01:40] our skirt
[3:01:42] sometime it's tight that we don't even
[3:01:44] know what to answer
[3:01:46] but father we thank you for your grace
[3:01:49] that was there enough
[3:01:51] to open this scripture and when we
[3:01:54] looked at the scripture we went into the
[3:01:56] message of the hour
[3:01:57] we found her everything dovetailed and
[3:02:00] now we understand what to bring to your
[3:02:03] children
[3:02:04] and what lord father to edify the church
[3:02:06] with
[3:02:07] so that it's not going to be something
[3:02:09] that is based on our personal preference
[3:02:12] but it will be solely based upon the
[3:02:14] word
[3:02:15] and the revealed word of the hour lord
[3:02:18] we have preached many things in this
[3:02:20] church
[3:02:21] we have touched many territory in this
[3:02:23] church we have touched many territory
[3:02:26] that we
[3:02:27] have lord father demonstrated and today
[3:02:30] you put on our heart lord father for
[3:02:33] those that had
[3:02:33] questioned to find their answer on how
[3:02:36] they should present themselves to the
[3:02:38] public
[3:02:39] to be written epistle to be an example
[3:02:42] to reflect your beauty to affect your
[3:02:45] fellowship
[3:02:46] to reflect your glory to reflect the
[3:02:48] deity
[3:02:49] to reflect lord father your character so
[3:02:52] that they may be the salt of the earth
[3:02:55] that can lord bring thirst to other
[3:02:57] people's life
[3:02:58] other young people going to other
[3:03:00] churches that they want to be like them
[3:03:02] lord
[3:03:03] father you don't have another hand but
[3:03:05] our hand lord
[3:03:06] you don't have another body that you can
[3:03:09] use on this earth now
[3:03:10] because you took your own body and you
[3:03:12] put it on the cross lord
[3:03:14] as a propitiation for our sin lord but
[3:03:17] now you are borrowing the body of your
[3:03:19] bread
[3:03:20] to express lord your gospel and you use
[3:03:23] the woman lord
[3:03:24] that you have chose since the garden of
[3:03:26] eden as adored lord father
[3:03:29] to express your attribute now you are
[3:03:31] using her in this end time
[3:03:33] as a door to express your holiness lord
[3:03:36] father may you give a revelation to this
[3:03:38] church
[3:03:38] a revelation to the young man a
[3:03:41] revelation to the young sister
[3:03:42] a revelation to the mothers and father
[3:03:45] lord so that they might realize oh god
[3:03:47] lord father the hour that we are living
[3:03:50] that this world
[3:03:51] is dying this world is looking for real
[3:03:54] true epistle that they can look into it
[3:03:57] that they can fellowship with it
[3:03:59] that they can read christ jesus christ
[3:04:02] in our life and in the way that we
[3:04:04] behave
[3:04:04] father may the holy spirit continue to
[3:04:07] minister to your children
[3:04:08] and if somebody is liking your spirit
[3:04:11] lord
[3:04:11] father may this morning they find grace
[3:04:14] that can
[3:04:15] open the doors of heaven lord and father
[3:04:17] i'll bring them the holy spirit lord
[3:04:20] down deep in their soul that can guide
[3:04:22] them
[3:04:23] in all truth lord because hearing the
[3:04:25] word is one thing
[3:04:26] but doing it lord father he takes the
[3:04:29] holy spirit
[3:04:30] we are tired of doing our own work lord
[3:04:33] we did it we fell many times
[3:04:35] we did it and it causes us to have a
[3:04:37] self-righteousness
[3:04:38] it causes us to have frustration when
[3:04:41] lord father we fell
[3:04:43] to do what we know we were supposed to
[3:04:44] be doing but lord father
[3:04:46] we understood that this work is a work
[3:04:49] of rest
[3:04:50] lord may you come lord father the holy
[3:04:52] spirit and may you guide our life
[3:04:54] our individual life lord so that it will
[3:04:56] not be us
[3:04:57] living lord but it's gonna be christ
[3:04:59] jesus christ
[3:05:00] living through us lord and manifesting
[3:05:03] your own life
[3:05:04] father we thank you for the grace the
[3:05:06] church gave me to go over the time lord
[3:05:08] father
[3:05:09] lord may you bless them may you protect
[3:05:11] them may you continue to minister lord
[3:05:14] and to reveal them your word
[3:05:16] individually lord
[3:05:17] in their personal life we commit them
[3:05:19] unto the hand
[3:05:20] and we pray for those that are sick in
[3:05:22] the body or those that came with
[3:05:24] different needs lord father
[3:05:26] in their personal life lord that you
[3:05:28] meet their needs lord
[3:05:30] and you give them a good answer lord and
