[38:10] [Music]
[38:14] i don't want to say american time

[38:23] amen don't come there 20 or 40 or two
[38:27] hours late

[38:31] told me that there is like uh
[38:34] man's
[38:35] you know what it is look at your text
[38:38] the
[38:39] the message has been emailed
[38:41] sent to everybody so you should be

[39:26] okay
[39:31] say it again
[39:41] the fun day for the kids
[39:46] okay so you had tight on that one
[39:49] we figured out what to do but so far
[39:52] they told me september the 24th amen so
[39:55] you'll get the confirmation by sunday
[39:58] lord's willing amen
[40:00] blessed be the name of the lord let's go
[40:02] to our scripture tonight
[40:05] i was about to say this morning
[40:12] amen
[40:13] if you know the seals already that's
[40:15] fine
[40:16] praise god
[40:18] if you don't know the seals
[40:20] i don't know what you've been looking at
[40:23] because we went over and this message
[40:25] will always navigate with sales
[40:28] all the time
[40:30] so you better just go ahead and make
[40:32] sure you understand the seals because
[40:34] when i'll say there's still there's no
[40:36] way you can preach this message without
[40:38] any i mean moving with the seals because
[40:41] the sales open the entire word of god
[40:44] amen so if you don't know the seals by
[40:46] this time it's not my fault it's your
[40:48] thought we went through that in the old
[40:50] church we went through that again on the
[40:53] the good samaritan so we display
[40:55] everything in detail so you should be
[40:58] ready when we say well who is the first
[41:00] uh anointing who's the second anointing
[41:03] who's the third anointing all of that
[41:04] you should be familiar amen
[41:06] all right let's go to genesis chapter 1
[41:09] verse 20.
[41:12] i need to move up a little bit
[41:14] so we'll be good on sunday let's see how
[41:17] the lord
[41:18] were directed if you dare you can say
[41:21] amen
[41:24] i know it's wednesday
[41:27] if you're there you can say amen
[41:29] some folks are not here so you need to
[41:31] double on the amen
[41:34] amen
[41:36] verse 20 genesis chapter 1 verse 20. the
[41:40] bible says and god say
[41:43] let the waters
[41:45] bring forth
[41:46] abundantly the moving creature
[41:50] that has life
[41:52] amen
[41:56] and the fowl
[41:58] that may
[41:59] fly above the earth in an open firmament
[42:04] of heaven you might be seated
[42:06] if you look here there are two
[42:09] categories created here
[42:11] the first one
[42:13] is the creature in the water
[42:16] everybody clear
[42:19] we okay
[42:21] creatures
[42:23] in water
[42:25] amen
[42:26] so you got your whales your crocodile
[42:28] and everything there and the second
[42:31] category
[42:32] are the foul
[42:35] of the air amen you got your ego your
[42:38] clothes everything else so stay tight
[42:42] now the way it's spoken in uh
[42:44] verse 20 the bible say let the waters
[42:47] bring forth
[42:50] amen
[42:51] you will think that the birds were
[42:54] created by
[42:56] water because the bible say let the
[42:59] water bring forth
[43:01] amen it looks like the bird
[43:04] and the creature in the seas and the
[43:06] fishes were created by water but that's
[43:09] not
[43:10] that's not the truth
[43:16] let's go to verse 21 and god created
[43:19] great wealth
[43:21] everybody okay
[43:22] these are the creature of the sea
[43:25] god created great dwells
[43:31] it's not me it's the seals that are
[43:33] doing this to the bible
[43:35] it's not me i have nothing to do with
[43:37] this amen
[43:40] the god created great wealth and every
[43:44] living creature that moves everybody
[43:47] okay
[43:48] so the creatures of this sea which the
[43:50] water brought forth abundantly everybody
[43:54] okay
[43:55] after their kind and every wing foul
[43:59] after it's gone and god saw that he was
[44:02] good so if you stuck right there you
[44:05] will think that the creature of the sea
[44:08] and the fall of the air were created by
[44:11] water
[44:13] if they were created by water if a fish
[44:16] die
[44:18] and you leave it there any rocks we
[44:20] should see water coming out
[44:24] make sense
[44:25] but when a fish die if you leave a
[44:27] creature there you'll find out that no
[44:29] water will come out of it it will turn
[44:31] into the dust
[44:34] we
[44:35] [Laughter]
[44:35] [Music]
[44:38] let me help you a little bit let me help
[44:41] you go to genesis 2 chapter 19 so we'll
[44:44] come back to this
[44:46] so let's stabilize because sometimes
[44:48] people look at me like i'm writing a new
[44:50] bible that i'm not writing a new bible
[44:52] i'm just reading the whole bible
[44:57] amen
[44:59] genesis 2 chapter 19. if you dare you
[45:02] can say amen and out of the water
[45:06] the lord god form every
[45:09] and every water
[45:11] so the fallout form from what
[45:15] we okay now now you're stable okay so
[45:19] the fowl comes from the ground
[45:23] in other words from the earth
[45:26] or to me more precise the dust
[45:31] everybody okay
[45:32] okay the foul we found out that they
[45:34] come from the dust what about the
[45:36] creature in the water the bible says it
[45:38] was the water let's the water bring
[45:41] forth
[45:42] if you stuck in genesis one you will
[45:43] think that god created the fowl and the
[45:46] creature of the sea from the water
[45:48] that's not true
[45:49] god created them from the earth
[45:56] don't worry my friend we will
[45:58] navigate the bible says this in the book
[46:01] of psalms 104
[46:04] verse 24 the bible says that so
[46:07] is this great
[46:09] whoever is on the computer work with me
[46:11] so is this great and wide sea everybody
[46:14] okay
[46:15] wearing are things creeping
[46:18] innumerable in the sea both small and
[46:22] great beasts in the sea
[46:24] there go the ship
[46:26] there is the leviton
[46:28] whom god has made to play the ring
[46:31] these all this creature wait upon thee
[46:35] that the mayors give them their meat in
[46:38] water
[46:39] if god can give the creature of the sea
[46:42] food in due season whatever human being
[46:45] that's why we have the message in this
[46:47] season
[46:49] everybody okay
[46:51] he said that that gives them the gather
[46:55] that hand they are what
[46:57] filled with goods the hardest that face
[47:00] they are water
[47:01] that takes away their breath when they
[47:04] are killed they do water
[47:06] and return to the
[47:08] so the creature of the sea are made out
[47:10] of water
[47:11] any question my friend
[47:18] so number one the creature of the sea
[47:21] are made out of water and the fall of
[47:24] the air are made out of water i love
[47:26] this church
[47:28] now let's go back to our scripture
[47:31] genesis chapter 20 of chapter one we
[47:33] already read chapter verse 21 and 21
[47:37] jump to verse 24
[47:39] if you dare you can say amen
[47:42] i hope
[47:44] you there
[47:45] and god say
[47:47] let the water
[47:49] the dust again
[47:51] let the earth
[47:52] bring forth the living creature
[47:55] after it comes
[47:58] cuddle
[47:59] creeping things and the beast of the
[48:01] earth after its water
[48:04] so we see the third category here we
[48:07] have the cuddle
[48:09] we have the beast
[48:11] where your serpent
[48:13] was there and we have the creeping
[48:15] things
[48:17] amen
[48:18] all of them are coming from what
[48:21] the dust the ground or the earth or the
[48:26] dust
[48:27] we okay
[48:29] so when god created the creature in the
[48:31] water dust created the fire dust created
[48:35] the beast the caddo the creeping things
[48:38] dust
[48:39] we okay
[48:41] job to verse uh
[48:43] 27
[48:49] now we're going to another category
[48:53] we okay
[48:54] category number four
[48:58] the bible say so god
[49:01] created man
[49:03] now we are creating man
[49:08] we okay
[49:09] he created man
[49:11] in his own image
[49:15] not an animal
[49:16] the man this man
[49:18] is first at the image of god
[49:21] in the image of god we will see what is
[49:24] the image of god down the road amen
[49:27] and so god created man in his own image
[49:31] in the image of god created he him one
[49:35] person
[49:36] we okay
[49:38] but that hymn
[49:41] is male and water you see now
[49:45] so this man
[49:47] they call him him
[49:49] but in him
[49:51] we got man
[49:54] and female
[49:59] so from the beginning god himself is not
[50:01] homosexual
[50:05] [Music]
[50:08] right from the beginning
[50:10] anybody okay so it's a perversion
[50:12] so from god he's both male and female i
[50:15] will show you that down the road
[50:17] we will go through the scripture we okay
[50:20] now he created him male and female
[50:23] created he water so now
[50:27] in him
[50:28] we have them
[50:31] amen
[50:34] everybody okay
[50:36] what substance did god use here to
[50:39] create man
[50:47] everybody okay
[50:48] everybody okay
[50:50] god according to john chapter 4 verse 26
[50:54] god is a spirit
[50:58] 24-26 everybody okay and he created man
[51:02] in his honor
[51:03] and in his own water
[51:05] was jesus born here
[51:07] because we know jesus is god
[51:09] but jesus was now born here
[51:14] go back to genesis one
[51:15] [Music]
[51:17] you are slowing me down let's go to
[51:19] verse two
[51:22] let's go to verse 2 and the earth was
[51:24] without form and void
[51:26] and darkness was upon the face of the
[51:28] water

[51:36] your boss just dropped me right here so
[51:38] i can help somebody the spirit of god so
[51:41] who was creating
[51:43] the spirit of god if god if man was made

[1:19:33] ministry

[1:21:57] when it's talking about the standards
[1:22:01] you remember daniel heard the thunders
[1:22:03] and they told him that he was not for
[1:22:05] you
[1:22:07] he wanted to understand they said no no
[1:22:09] no no that's not for you that's for the
[1:22:11] end time amen
[1:22:13] verse 9
[1:22:15] and he said go your way daniel
[1:22:18] for the words
[1:22:20] are closed up
[1:22:21] and they are water
[1:22:23] until the time of the water
[1:22:25] always to the end amen

[1:22:45] seal to do
[1:22:47] purify and make somebody water because
[1:22:51] the bride will be with us but our
[1:22:53] wrinkle

[1:22:56] so you need a message that's gonna
[1:22:58] purify the blood please the bread make
[1:23:02] her pure with that spot without wanker
[1:23:06] to meet the problem
[1:23:07] [Music]
[1:23:10] everybody okay so far
[1:23:12] now we are dealing with the beast
[1:23:16] and we found out that the beast
[1:23:19] from the beginning
[1:23:22] let me go this way
[1:23:24] we got a beast everybody okay
[1:23:26] we got a beast at the beginning
[1:23:29] at the beginning there is a beast
[1:23:32] amen
[1:23:33] and that beast we found out that he was
[1:23:35] the serpent
[1:23:36] everybody okay
[1:23:38] but brother branham say and the beast is
[1:23:41] also at the end
[1:23:44] let me go this way he said the beast
[1:23:47] from the beginning he was the beast at
[1:23:49] the garden of eden that was the serpent
[1:23:52] and the serpent became the devil the old
[1:23:55] serpent everybody okay
[1:23:57] and he is the beast at the end
[1:23:59] and he shows that he is a religious
[1:24:03] person and a water
[1:24:06] a denomination that do water
[1:24:11] everybody okay at the end
[1:24:14] the beast at the end
[1:24:18] everybody okay
[1:24:19] the beast at the end
[1:24:22] is a
[1:24:26] a denomination we okay
[1:24:28] that makes water
[1:24:33] we okay
[1:24:34] it's a harlot
[1:24:36] that produces our lots
[1:24:42] we okay now so at the end the business a
[1:24:46] woman and the beast is also a religious
[1:24:50] person
[1:24:55] why
[1:24:57] are we going to the beginning
[1:25:01] brother branham say that in the
[1:25:03] beginning
[1:25:05] we have the beast
[1:25:07] and the beast at the beginning is a
[1:25:09] serpent
[1:25:11] amen but as you move forward through the
[1:25:14] chair
[1:25:15] at the end we also have a beast
[1:25:18] but the beast at the end number one it's
[1:25:21] a religious person
[1:25:24] everybody okay
[1:25:25] number two
[1:25:27] it is a denomination
[1:25:31] a denomination that made the
[1:25:33] denomination
[1:25:37] amen and a denomination is a church
[1:25:41] and a church is a woman
[1:25:44] amen
[1:25:45] so it's a church
[1:25:47] that produces churches that are also
[1:25:50] denomination
[1:25:53] we okay now
[1:25:54] we okay now
[1:25:56] praise god
[1:25:57] why are we going back to the garden of
[1:26:01] eden
[1:26:01] the way we did to study this beast
[1:26:05] the bible says in isaiah 46 10
[1:26:08] that god
[1:26:11] declaring
[1:26:13] the end from water
[1:26:17] so
[1:26:18] the beginning already have the end
[1:26:23] everybody okay
[1:26:25] god
[1:26:26] when he's declaring the end
[1:26:28] he declare it from the beginning
[1:26:33] everybody okay
[1:26:34] that's why we to understand the end you
[1:26:38] need to go back to the beginning because
[1:26:40] the beginning already declared the end
[1:26:43] that's why the bible says the old
[1:26:46] serpent which is the devil you need to
[1:26:50] go to the old serpent to understand how
[1:26:53] the devil works
[1:26:55] that's why brother branham said the
[1:26:57] seventh seal was in genesis
[1:27:00] everybody here and the seventh still was
[1:27:03] in revelation
[1:27:04] but if you wanna understand the seventh
[1:27:06] seal better you need to go back to the
[1:27:09] beginning because the beginning already
[1:27:11] declared the end
[1:27:13] are we okay
[1:27:15] i'm reading the bible
[1:27:17] he said declaring the end from the
[1:27:19] beginning in other words for you to
[1:27:22] understand what is happening now
[1:27:24] you need to go back to the beginning
[1:27:27] and understand the beginning once you
[1:27:30] catch the beginning you will begin to
[1:27:32] decode the end quickly
[1:27:35] everybody okay so far because the
[1:27:36] beginning is genesis
[1:27:40] and the end is the revelation apocalypse
[1:27:43] unfolding unveiling opening breaking
[1:27:49] everybody okay so from ancient time
[1:27:53] the things that are not done
[1:27:55] because even the lamb of god was slain
[1:27:58] where before the foundation of the world
[1:28:02] if you want to understand what jesus is
[1:28:04] doing at the cross you need to go back
[1:28:05] to the beginning even when marriage and
[1:28:08] divorce was given to jesus christ jesus
[1:28:11] said at the beginning in other words
[1:28:14] let's go back to the beginning then you
[1:28:16] will understand marriage and divorce at
[1:28:19] the beginning god created one man and
[1:28:22] one female that is the
[1:28:25] [Music]
[1:28:26] beginning everybody okay
[1:28:29] he says my cursed self shall stand and i
[1:28:32] will do all by my water
[1:28:35] it's all by the pleasure of god
[1:28:38] now if we're going to the beginning
[1:28:40] the bible says in number chapter 16
[1:28:44] that and they fell verse 22 upon their
[1:28:47] faces and say oh god
[1:28:49] the god of the spirit of water
[1:28:52] all flesh
[1:28:54] number 27 verse 16
[1:28:57] let the lord the god of the spirit of
[1:29:00] water
[1:29:01] so our flesh get their spirit from god
[1:29:05] amen
[1:29:06] everybody here so when eve is saying
[1:29:08] that i got a child from the lord
[1:29:14] it doesn't mean that cain
[1:29:16] is a child of god
[1:29:18] cain was a son of the devil but every
[1:29:22] spirit must come from god
[1:29:24] amen we okay
[1:29:28] first corinthians 15 39 the bible say
[1:29:33] our flesh is not the same flesh
[1:29:35] but there is one can the flesh of water
[1:29:39] we see in the category another flesh for
[1:29:41] water
[1:29:42] another fresh for water another flesh
[1:29:44] for water
[1:29:49] we okay
[1:29:50] let's go back here there is another
[1:29:52] flesh
[1:29:54] there is a flesh for man we okay
[1:29:57] there is a flesh for beast we okay
[1:29:59] there is a flesh for what fishes we okay
[1:30:02] and there is a flesh for water
[1:30:04] all categories are given by power where
[1:30:07] did paul learn this thing
[1:30:09] amen and all the spirit of everything
[1:30:12] here comes from god
[1:30:15] everybody okay
[1:30:16] now we found out that when god created
[1:30:21] he created the fishes and the great were
[1:30:24] from the dust
[1:30:26] he created the fire from the dust he
[1:30:28] created the car that they beat the
[1:30:30] creeping friends from the dust when he
[1:30:32] created man first
[1:30:34] man was a spirit
[1:30:36] and then
[1:30:37] man was both male and female
[1:30:40] but he pulled the male part and made the
[1:30:43] male part exactly the way he made the
[1:30:47] cutter the way he made the foul the way
[1:30:50] he made the dust another word man
[1:30:56] we okay
[1:30:57] was created
[1:30:59] from the original creation
[1:31:04] anybody care
[1:31:05] anybody okay because god originally was
[1:31:09] creating everything from there
[1:31:12] so he created the fire he created man he
[1:31:14] created the creeping thing everything
[1:31:16] from the dust so when he took this man
[1:31:20] and put him into the body everybody here
[1:31:23] we found that god breathed
[1:31:26] and when he breathed
[1:31:28] loud man became a living souls
[1:31:32] what does he mean brother stephen
[1:31:34] brother branham says this in the message
[1:31:36] brad's famous name
[1:31:38] he said but what god did
[1:31:40] he breathed the breath of eternal life
[1:31:43] amen
[1:31:45] can you say amen
[1:31:47] that's not me you're saying a man to the
[1:31:48] word
[1:31:50] then he become a water
[1:31:52] a soul that water
[1:31:56] amen okay
[1:31:58] everybody okay that's why jesus christ
[1:32:01] is the second and the last adam
[1:32:05] [Music]
[1:32:08] everybody here because in river jordan
[1:32:11] they have to put the pillar of high in
[1:32:13] jesus christ
[1:32:16] [Applause]
[1:32:20] we okay
[1:32:22] then the pillar of fire
[1:32:24] never enter the baby jesus
[1:32:32] everybody here the people of fire never
[1:32:35] enter a teenager jesus
[1:32:39] we okay
[1:32:40] the pedal of fire entered jesus when he
[1:32:43] was 30
[1:32:44] when he was a grown-up man
[1:32:46] adam was not a baby
[1:32:49] adam was created a grown-up man
[1:32:52] everybody okay when they created him a
[1:32:55] grown-up man god briefed the breath of
[1:32:58] eternal life when jesus christ became a
[1:33:01] grown-up man god brought the pillar of
[1:33:04] fire jesus is the second and the last
[1:33:07] atom
[1:33:11] [Music]

[1:33:30] amen everybody okay
[1:33:32] eternal soul
[1:33:34] because god breathed
[1:33:37] not what nature done by what god did
[1:33:41] breathed the breath of life into his
[1:33:44] nostril and he became a water
[1:33:47] so we found out that
[1:33:49] in every in this entire planet here in
[1:33:53] genesis everybody okay
[1:33:56] the only person that had their soul
[1:33:59] was adam
[1:34:02] everybody okay animals don't have souls
[1:34:06] we already dealt with that one if you
[1:34:08] miss it you need to go back to the old
[1:34:09] sermon everybody okay
[1:34:12] now the soul that first saw that was
[1:34:15] made available in the flesh was the soul
[1:34:19] of adam
[1:34:21] are we okay
[1:34:22] as soon as that soul was made available
[1:34:26] in the flesh
[1:34:28] we okay a creature naturally with a soul
[1:34:32] god came and locked that soul
[1:34:37] are you following me
[1:34:39] are you following me adam never lived a
[1:34:42] normal soul
[1:34:46] do you follow me
[1:34:48] as soon as adam was created
[1:34:51] in human flesh
[1:34:53] god sealed his soul
[1:34:55] in other words god blocked his soul
[1:34:59] so that no one can use him again
[1:35:01] [Music]
[1:35:05] everybody okay
[1:35:06] everybody okay
[1:35:08] everybody okay
[1:35:09] everybody okay
[1:35:11] everybody okay so when adam was here
[1:35:14] everything is lucky in nature
[1:35:18] [Music]
[1:35:22] can i continue
[1:35:24] brother branham says this what is the
[1:35:26] purpose so yeah the bible says this he
[1:35:29] said what is man what is a man profited
[1:35:33] if he shall gain the water
[1:35:36] and lose his honor
[1:35:40] what shall a man give
[1:35:42] in exchange to water
[1:35:45] so the soul is very precious
[1:35:49] your soul
[1:35:50] is very precious
[1:35:53] [Music]
[1:35:56] the soul that you are exposing to
[1:35:59] pornography is very precious
[1:36:02] [Music]
[1:36:04] the soul that you are giving to the
[1:36:06] devil is very precious
[1:36:10] there is nothing in this world
[1:36:13] that you can compare with your soul
[1:36:19] brother branham said a soul once a
[1:36:21] thousand world
[1:36:24] [Music]
[1:36:26] you put your job before your soul
[1:36:29] [Music]
[1:36:30] you put your passion on your body before
[1:36:33] your soul
[1:36:34] you put your pride before your soul you
[1:36:38] put your own desire before your soul
[1:36:41] you put your own preferences before your
[1:36:44] soul
[1:36:47] what can you exchange
[1:36:49] to the press of your soul
[1:36:51] amen god saw that the soul was so
[1:36:55] precious
[1:36:56] as soon as he was created god locked it
[1:37:06] i'm in different avenue my friend
[1:37:09] everybody here ever here why did god
[1:37:12] steal adam quickly
[1:37:16] [Music]
[1:37:21] everybody okay
[1:37:22] everybody okay
[1:37:24] everybody okay
[1:37:25] then when god begin to look

[1:37:30] is not complete
[1:37:35] we okay
[1:37:37] we're okay
[1:37:38] so we expect god
[1:37:42] to use the dust
[1:37:45] everybody okay off the earth

[1:37:51] water

[1:37:54] just like he did the cuddle and the
[1:37:56] creeping things just like he did man the
[1:37:59] male one
[1:38:00] we expected god to create another mold
[1:38:05] and then pick up the woman and do the
[1:38:08] same thing
[1:38:08] [Music]
[1:38:11] everybody okay

[1:38:18] and opened adam
[1:38:20] we okay
[1:38:21] and took a dirt that was already changed
[1:38:26] and finished
[1:38:27] because adam didn't need any more work

[1:38:32] there was nothing to change in adam
[1:38:34] anymore there was nothing that god could
[1:38:37] come and say maybe this reaper made it
[1:38:39] wrong i need to change the reap uniform
[1:38:41] no when adam was made he was finished
[1:38:44] everybody

[1:41:41] first product this is the first product
[1:41:43] but this one they took the first product
[1:41:46] and they made the second product out of
[1:41:49] the first
[1:41:51] they took the material that was already
[1:41:54] cooked
[1:41:54] and they cook it out again

[1:42:19] everybody okay
[1:42:20] we okay
[1:42:22] now according to what we found out we
[1:42:25] found out that in the best category here
[1:42:28] there was a creature
[1:42:30] this creature was the serpent
[1:42:34] amen he was more sadder than any other
[1:42:37] creature he came right after man
[1:42:43] what if was higher
[1:42:46] to the serpent
[1:42:47] was only the soul
[1:42:55] are we okay
[1:42:56] [Music]
[1:42:58] lord help me brother branham say the
[1:43:00] next one to a human being was the
[1:43:02] serpent
[1:43:03] the bible said he was the most saddle of
[1:43:05] all the beasts of the earth the field
[1:43:07] i'm going to repeat this again sometime
[1:43:08] i repeat and it's like a new quote he
[1:43:11] said he had almost the water
[1:43:15] he had a place for soul but what he did
[1:43:18] do he saw that to him
[1:43:20] to deceive god
[1:43:22] amen
[1:43:23] satan comer the serpent almost had the
[1:43:26] water
[1:43:29] so the serpent did not have a soul
[1:43:33] everybody okay
[1:43:35] that's why he was placed in the category
[1:43:38] of the beast
[1:43:40] but this serpent could talk
[1:43:43] we okay now
[1:43:45] from the soul perspective
[1:43:50] you follow me if was superior to the
[1:43:53] serpent
[1:43:57] are we okay
[1:43:58] are we okay
[1:44:00] but from the body perspective
[1:44:06] following me
[1:44:07] you following me the serpent was more
[1:44:10] stronger than eve
[1:44:11] [Music]
[1:44:15] we okay
[1:44:17] the serpent was strong in the body
[1:44:20] if was strong in the soul
[1:44:23] so it have to guard her soul
[1:44:26] in order to control the snake
[1:44:30] notice in order to control the serpent
[1:44:33] she needs to increase her strength in
[1:44:35] the soul
[1:44:36] [Music]
[1:44:41] everybody okay
[1:44:43] the bible say men shall not live by
[1:44:45] water
[1:44:46] [Music]
[1:44:48] man shall not live by water
[1:44:50] but by every water
[1:44:53] bread goes to the body

[1:51:25] everybody okay
[1:51:27] so through the body
[1:51:29] the serpent is higher
[1:51:31] because the serpent came from the dust
[1:51:34] original
[1:51:35] through the soil eve is higher
[1:51:38] we okay
[1:51:39] now
[1:51:41] now
[1:51:42] the soul of adam is sealed
[1:51:47] but the soul of evil was not sealed
[1:51:50] but the devil had the desire
[1:51:54] what was the desire of the devil
[1:51:56] [Music]
[1:51:59] brother branham says this satan has
[1:52:02] known this all along
[1:52:05] he also want to indwell man
[1:52:10] even as god
[1:52:12] so does
[1:52:13] but god has reserved to himself that
[1:52:18] satan cannot do that
[1:52:20] god alone appear in water
[1:52:24] satan could not and cannot do that he
[1:52:27] cannot have water
[1:52:31] amen
[1:52:34] god created adam
[1:52:36] and he breathed the breath of life into
[1:52:38] adam the serpent wanted to create also
[1:52:41] somebody and he also can enter that
[1:52:44] person
[1:52:46] but he doesn't have creative power
[1:52:50] but he longs he's looking for souls
[1:52:55] souls that are in prison now he's
[1:52:57] looking for souls
[1:52:59] but
[1:53:00] the serpent doesn't have soul
[1:53:04] we okay now
[1:53:05] the only available souls
[1:53:08] was the soul of who
[1:53:13] we good
[1:53:14] [Music]
[1:53:16] we're good
[1:53:17] we're good
[1:53:19] the only way for satan to accomplish
[1:53:23] what he wanted to do was to enter water
[1:53:27] in eden even as he entered by evil
[1:53:30] spirit in the swan and gatherer
[1:53:32] gadara god does not enter what
[1:53:36] but satan can and will to water
[1:53:40] accomplish water
[1:53:46] we okay
[1:53:47] can i move on
[1:53:49] so now in the garden of eden we found
[1:53:52] out that satan
[1:53:54] is longing for two people
[1:54:00] amen
[1:54:02] set and found out we went through this
[1:54:04] that there is a creature called the
[1:54:06] serpent and this creature can talk
[1:54:10] and do everything right
[1:54:13] just like men
[1:54:14] amen the only problem no soul so they
[1:54:17] put him in the category of the animal
[1:54:20] but even though he's an animal but he's
[1:54:22] so strong in his intellect
[1:54:25] amen his intelligence is so high
[1:54:29] everybody okay
[1:54:31] then the devil is longing to enter man
[1:54:35] but serpent is a beast
[1:54:38] a beast with our soul
[1:54:43] ever here
[1:54:44] and the only available soul remaining is
[1:54:48] the soul of a woman
[1:54:52] amen
[1:54:54] that soul was not sealed
[1:54:57] everybody okay so in order to gain a
[1:55:00] soul
[1:55:02] [Music]
[1:55:04] we okay
[1:55:05] the damn for brother branham say when he
[1:55:08] have something to accomplish even if he
[1:55:11] takes him to enter animal he will enter
[1:55:13] an animal
[1:55:14] just because he want to do something
[1:55:18] and the animal he chose was the serpent
[1:55:21] we okay now
[1:55:22] when he enter the serpent the serpent
[1:55:26] becomes the devil
[1:55:28] incarnated
[1:55:32] but the animal is not really the
[1:55:35] satisfaction of the devil
[1:55:37] the devil could enter the beast and come
[1:55:40] back out but he doesn't have control in
[1:55:43] the children of god he doesn't have
[1:55:46] access in the children of god the devil
[1:55:50] longer so to have a soul
[1:55:54] everybody okay
[1:55:56] everybody okay so he uses the serpent
[1:55:59] now
[1:56:00] everybody care
[1:56:01] as an agent
[1:56:04] everybody okay
[1:56:06] everybody okay because he cannot create
[1:56:11] and he found out
[1:56:13] that this serpent matches him
[1:56:16] correctly
[1:56:17] amen
[1:56:19] if he can get the seed of the serpent
[1:56:22] [Music]
[1:56:25] the seed of the wicked one
[1:56:28] remember on sunday
[1:56:30] remember on saturday if he can get that
[1:56:33] seed
[1:56:34] and put it on a woman
[1:56:38] we okay
[1:56:39] because a woman is an bedo
[1:56:42] whatever the man gives she give an
[1:56:44] output
[1:56:46] the one who determined the baby is the
[1:56:48] man
[1:56:49] you give a woman she gave you a girl you
[1:56:52] give a man she gave you a ball whatever
[1:56:54] you put she gave it out everybody okay
[1:56:57] so satan was shadow
[1:57:00] the serpent understood all those laws
[1:57:04] subtility you remember so satan said i'm
[1:57:08] gonna use this peace here
[1:57:12] because i'm not able to create
[1:57:14] [Music]
[1:57:16] everybody here that god operates by law
[1:57:21] and there is a law called the law of
[1:57:23] reproduction
[1:57:27] everybody okay
[1:57:28] everybody okay
[1:57:29] everybody okay and god say let every
[1:57:32] beast
[1:57:34] reproduce
[1:57:36] after its on what
[1:57:38] elephant remain elephant zebra remains
[1:57:41] zebra
[1:57:43] that's why hybridization is of the
[1:57:46] endeavor
[1:57:46] [Music]
[1:57:50] you start mixing stuff
[1:57:52] the devil everybody okay
[1:57:55] so the devil wanted to create to be like
[1:57:58] the most high oh god but he doesn't have
[1:58:02] the power to create he uses the
[1:58:05] intellect
[1:58:08] to begin to manufacture
[1:58:11] which is a perversion of creation
[1:58:16] laboratory
[1:58:18] is a perversion of creation
[1:58:22] mixing up genes
[1:58:25] is a perversion of creation
[1:58:30] pulling up new strand of diseases
[1:58:33] is a pervasion of creation
[1:58:36] [Music]
[1:58:38] ever here so the devil wanted to create
[1:58:42] a species
[1:58:45] for himself
[1:58:46] but that species
[1:58:48] was not in the original creation
[1:58:54] everybody okay because the bible says
[1:58:57] cain was off the water
[1:59:00] so when he put the seed into the woman
[1:59:04] the woman produced cain
[1:59:08] everybody clear
[1:59:10] kim
[1:59:11] was a mixture
[1:59:13] of animals
[1:59:17] and human
[1:59:19] but with her soul
[1:59:26] [Music]
[1:59:30] up in genesis 4
[1:59:31] everything i tried to preach i don't i
[1:59:33] can't
[1:59:38] my goodness
[1:59:41] time is already gone i don't know how i
[1:59:42] can get to the beast of babylon
[1:59:46] let's go to verse four
[1:59:48] lord help me please
[1:59:50] you there
[1:59:54] i say i'm gonna preach this boom and
[1:59:56] finish and let them go
[2:00:00] everybody here
[2:00:01] verse uh
[2:00:03] six
[2:00:04] and the lord said to ken
[2:00:06] why are you angry
[2:00:08] and why is your countenance fallen
[2:00:11] if you do well
[2:00:13] shall you not be accepted
[2:00:17] if you do not do well if you do not well
[2:00:21] seen
[2:00:22] everybody okay
[2:00:24] lies at the water
[2:00:27] stop which door
[2:00:30] do you think it was a door like this
[2:00:33] the door of who
[2:00:35] the door of cain
[2:00:37] which door does can
[2:00:43] everybody okay
[2:00:44] the sin lie at the door
[2:00:47] and to you shall his desire
[2:00:51] and you shall rule over
[2:00:55] sin become him
[2:01:01] sin now is him
[2:01:04] everybody okay
[2:01:05] so we found out now that can
[2:01:08] have a soul
[2:01:12] everybody okay
[2:01:14] cain have a soul
[2:01:16] everybody okay
[2:01:18] now what did god do when this is
[2:01:21] produced
[2:01:22] brother branham says this that for back
[2:01:25] in the eden the serpent was an upright
[2:01:28] creature
[2:01:29] he was close to man
[2:01:31] he was almost water
[2:01:34] you tired
[2:01:36] satan took advantage
[2:01:39] of the serpent water
[2:01:41] physical characteristic to use him to
[2:01:45] begin
[2:01:46] then god did water
[2:01:49] the pattern of the water
[2:01:52] no other beast can commingle with water
[2:01:55] what i want you to keep is god destroy
[2:01:59] the pattern of the water
[2:02:02] when god saw this
[2:02:04] he says now satan
[2:02:06] have him
[2:02:08] a mechanism
[2:02:10] he has a manufacture of human being
[2:02:15] not by creation
[2:02:17] by sex
[2:02:20] ever here you see why jesus was not born
[2:02:23] by sex
[2:02:25] you understand now
[2:02:26] but we will get to that later
[2:02:29] everybody okay so god say i need to
[2:02:32] destroy the manufacturer
[2:02:36] but i created the serpent
[2:02:39] i'm not going to lose that species
[2:02:40] completely
[2:02:43] everybody okay god destroy the serpent
[2:02:47] and change every aspect of the serpent
[2:02:51] are we there
[2:02:53] and made the serpent a snake
[2:02:59] this version
[2:03:01] loved the serpent
[2:03:04] [Music]
[2:03:08] everybody okay
[2:03:09] everybody okay
[2:03:11] everybody okay
[2:03:12] let's go back again to the beginning we
[2:03:15] have adam
[2:03:17] we have the serpent
[2:03:21] we have eve
[2:03:25] adam was locked
[2:03:28] by the breath of life
[2:03:30] the serpent which was the manufacturer
[2:03:32] of the devil
[2:03:34] god cursed him
[2:03:36] and made it a snake
[2:03:38] and in a snake it's locked
[2:03:40] you cannot have a snack
[2:03:42] impregnating a woman anymore
[2:03:46] it doesn't happen anymore so satan can
[2:03:49] enter the snake only to bite
[2:03:53] and kill somebody but not to manufacture
[2:03:57] a baby
[2:03:58] [Music]
[2:04:01] everybody okay
[2:04:02] everybody okay
[2:04:04] everybody okay
[2:04:06] god cursed the snake
[2:04:08] but god never cursed the woman
[2:04:16] let's go slowly
[2:04:18] adam looked
[2:04:20] the snake locked
[2:04:23] we have another creature that came in
[2:04:26] his name is cain
[2:04:32] the woman has a soul
[2:04:35] can has a soul
[2:04:38] amen
[2:04:40] when god came
[2:04:41] god never curse adam
[2:04:46] god curse the ground
[2:04:49] adam spared but still locked
[2:04:53] the certain curse
[2:04:55] locked
[2:04:57] everybody here
[2:04:59] if never was cursed
[2:05:02] they put their
[2:05:04] pen in her conception
[2:05:07] but if never changed from a woman to
[2:05:09] maybe a beast
[2:05:10] she remained evil because she came from
[2:05:13] god
[2:05:16] everybody okay
[2:05:17] when can sin god curse cain
[2:05:23] but he never changed the amount of me of
[2:05:27] cain
[2:05:33] that's amen
[2:05:38] job two verse uh

[2:05:54] which has opened its mouth to receive
[2:05:56] your brother's blood there is a
[2:05:58] discernment between god and cain but i'm
[2:06:00] skipping that
[2:06:01] time is already gone amen
[2:06:04] and you will see the difference in the
[2:06:05] predestination seed and the other one
[2:06:09] do you want to know it
[2:06:14] go back to verse six
[2:06:17] and the lord said to ken

[2:14:21] now the devil
[2:14:23] have two agents
[2:14:30] remaining
[2:14:32] that he can work with
[2:14:34] he lost the serpent
[2:14:37] about here but he still has the woman
[2:14:41] and cain

[2:14:43] [Music]
[2:14:45] everybody okay

[2:15:02] ken
[2:15:03] got his offering
[2:15:05] he built an altar and brother branham
[2:15:08] saying altar in the scripture is a
[2:15:10] church and he also brought his offering
[2:15:12] to god
[2:15:14] ever here but his offering was a fruit
[2:15:17] of his intellectual
[2:15:19] like his father the serpent
[2:15:21] [Music]
[2:15:23] but here but not a fruit of revelation
[2:15:27] it's a church without revelation
[2:15:31] it is a church
[2:15:34] it is a church can
[2:15:37] is a person
[2:15:40] is a person that is religious
[2:15:44] amen
[2:15:45] who works more with his
[2:15:48] intellect without revelation
[2:15:54] everybody here
[2:15:56] ever care and when he sees the other
[2:15:59] seed he has a tendency to kill it
[2:16:04] [Music]
[2:16:08] everybody okay
[2:16:09] everybody okay
[2:16:11] and eve is a woman
[2:16:15] which is a
[2:16:16] church
[2:16:18] everybody okay
[2:16:19] so we move
[2:16:22] from the beast
[2:16:24] as an animal
[2:16:26] as the agent of the devil
[2:16:29] into
[2:16:30] a woman a church and a religious person
[2:16:38] did you get it
[2:16:40] did you really get it
[2:16:42] did you really get it
[2:16:44] we moved from the beast
[2:16:48] in the beginning
[2:16:50] everybody okay to a religious
[2:16:55] person came
[2:16:57] and to a woman
[2:16:59] [Music]
[2:17:06] everybody okay
[2:17:08] everybody okay so we move
[2:17:10] from the serpentine animal in the
[2:17:13] beginning
[2:17:14] now the devil is still working with the
[2:17:17] woman and with a religious person a
[2:17:21] religious leader
[2:17:25] but that religious leader in his
[2:17:28] characteristic he's both animal
[2:17:32] and humanistic
[2:17:39] my time is gone i need to call this a
[2:17:43] different subject
[2:17:44] [Music]
[2:17:45] everybody okay
[2:17:47] my time is gone
[2:17:48] amen
[2:17:50] the bible says in first peter
[2:17:52] likewise he has been dwell with them
[2:17:56] women
[2:17:57] according to water
[2:17:59] giving honor and to the word
[2:18:02] as unto a what
[2:18:04] why we careful sir
[2:18:20] everybody okay
[2:18:21] everybody okay so from there from eden
[2:18:25] all the way to today
[2:18:29] the devil operates with these two
[2:18:35] [Music]
[2:18:38] everybody okay
[2:18:39] i'm gonna say this and i'm gonna stop
[2:18:41] because i can go further amen
[2:18:44] the bible says a weaker vessel
[2:18:47] you mean weaker a vessel is a human
[2:18:50] the bible says in the book of fact
[2:18:53] that by the lord say unto him go that
[2:18:56] way for he is a what
[2:18:58] that was paul
[2:18:59] a human being is a vessel
[2:19:02] every one of you should know how to
[2:19:04] possess his water
[2:19:06] so the body of eve is the weaker because
[2:19:10] it was not from the dust
[2:19:12] everybody okay
[2:19:14] if a man therefore purge himself from
[2:19:16] this he shall be a water
[2:19:19] so a vessel is a human being
[2:19:22] but the vessel of a woman is weaker
[2:19:24] because she never came straight from the
[2:19:26] dust she came from the river everybody
[2:19:28] okay
[2:19:29] that's why
[2:19:32] remember
[2:19:33] the woman
[2:19:35] the woman
[2:19:36] that
[2:19:37] brought the fruit
[2:19:39] to cain
[2:19:40] was not
[2:19:43] what
[2:19:45] say it again the woman was not locked
[2:19:49] and the woman that brought the fruit to
[2:19:51] adam was a memorial woman
[2:19:54] he was an immoral ever
[2:20:02] let me finish with this
[2:20:04] the bible says in exodus 34 when israel
[2:20:08] was leaving egypt god said
[2:20:10] that shall worship noradaga
[2:20:13] for the lord whose name is jealous is a
[2:20:17] water
[2:20:19] lest them make a covenant with the
[2:20:22] inhabitant of the land and they go a
[2:20:25] warring after their god
[2:20:28] and do sacrifice unto their gods and one
[2:20:32] called thee and eat of his water i don't
[2:20:35] want you to make friendship with the
[2:20:36] people of the world
[2:20:38] because they're gonna invite you to
[2:20:40] their party
[2:20:41] and before you know it you're going to
[2:20:43] find yourself in their party doing
[2:20:45] things that are contrary to your
[2:20:46] christian life
[2:20:48] that's what it means in plain word today
[2:20:51] everybody okay that's why brother
[2:20:53] branham said you must have friends that
[2:20:55] believe like you
[2:20:59] amen everybody okay
[2:21:00] and that shall take dad
[2:21:04] and da
[2:21:05] take off their daughter
[2:21:07] unto that son
[2:21:09] and their daughters
[2:21:11] everybody okay
[2:21:12] go a whirring after the water
[2:21:15] and make the sun go a whirring after the
[2:21:18] water
[2:21:20] god say
[2:21:21] don't take those women
[2:21:25] anybody okay
[2:21:26] and give the women
[2:21:29] to your children
[2:21:31] because the women in the beginning
[2:21:35] an immoral woman
[2:21:37] is the one who brought the voice to adam
[2:21:41] everybody okay if you take your sons and
[2:21:44] they begin to marry worldly women
[2:21:47] the worldly women will take your son
[2:21:50] away from me
[2:21:51] [Music]
[2:21:53] everybody okay
[2:21:54] what i'm saying here these agents are
[2:21:57] still valid
[2:21:59] the devil work with a religious person
[2:22:03] and he works with an immoral woman
[2:22:09] it's still valid
[2:22:11] everybody okay
[2:22:12] the bible says this in deuteronomy
[2:22:16] neither shall they make marriage with
[2:22:18] them
[2:22:19] that god shall not shall not give unto
[2:22:23] his son nor his daughter shall that take
[2:22:26] unto thy son
[2:22:27] for they will turn away your son
[2:22:31] not daughters
[2:22:32] god is pointing the man because the man
[2:22:35] is the carrier of the seed
[2:22:37] i'm afraid of human amen because the
[2:22:40] daughter would turn away that sun from
[2:22:43] water
[2:22:44] it was if that brought the fruit to adam
[2:22:48] the devil understood that i can still
[2:22:50] use a woman as an agent
[2:22:52] that they may serve at the water
[2:22:55] so will the anger of the lord be kindled
[2:22:58] against you and destroyed thee how
[2:23:01] don't take worldly women put them in
[2:23:03] israel they would take israel away from
[2:23:06] god
[2:23:07] anybody okay the children of israel
[2:23:09] dwell among the canaanites the high that
[2:23:12] and the amore and amuran and perez that
[2:23:15] and have i ten jebusat and they took the
[2:23:20] to beat the water
[2:23:22] and gave their daughters to the water
[2:23:25] and serve water automatically the devil
[2:23:28] uses
[2:23:30] it everybody okay
[2:23:33] the bible says that king solomon love
[2:23:36] how many
[2:23:37] [Music]
[2:23:42] many water
[2:23:44] not israelite woman
[2:23:47] not the eve when she was pure but the
[2:23:50] eve that was defiled
[2:23:52] many strange women together with the
[2:23:55] daughter of pharaoh
[2:23:56] women of moabite ammonite
[2:24:01] of the nation concerning which the lord
[2:24:04] said unto the children of israel you
[2:24:07] shall not go into water
[2:24:09] neither shall they come into you for
[2:24:12] surely guarantee that therefore did it
[2:24:15] at the beginning he brought the fruit to
[2:24:17] adam guarantee works
[2:24:23] hey but here they will turn away your
[2:24:26] heart after the water so if god if the
[2:24:29] devil want to take somebody under
[2:24:31] another god what does he uses
[2:24:34] why does he use his women to take men
[2:24:37] off the message
[2:24:40] watch when a woman is already off the
[2:24:42] message
[2:24:45] anybody okay

[2:24:58] with a gift like solomon
[2:25:02] but regardless of the gift
[2:25:05] that weapon still work for the devil
[2:25:08] amen for he came to pass when solomon
[2:25:11] was old that his wife turned away his
[2:25:14] heart after other
[2:25:15] for solomon went after ashtaroth the
[2:25:18] goddess of the zadonian and after
[2:25:20] milkand the abomination of the ammonia
[2:25:23] then did solomon built the man who built
[2:25:26] the temple now he built a high place for
[2:25:29] kimos the abomination of moab in the
[2:25:32] hill that is before water
[2:25:35] he built the temple at jerusalem he's
[2:25:37] now building the false altar at

[2:28:33] title let's stand
[2:28:41] [Applause]

[2:28:48] serpent seed on sunday i believe this
[2:28:50] should be clear
[2:28:52] amen it should be pretty clear that's
[2:28:56] why young man you don't play with women
[2:28:58] in the world

[2:29:02] if you're in this church you're still
[2:29:04] talking to women in the world or being
[2:29:06] friendly to worldly women
[2:29:08] and things like that you need to stop
[2:29:10] this game
[2:29:11] you are playing in the territory of the
[2:29:13] devil
[2:29:14] amen all it takes is an anointing for
[2:29:17] that woman you can find yourself in jail
