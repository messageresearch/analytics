[52:11] and he said and my speech and my
[52:14] preaching was not with enticing words of

[52:19] but in the demonstration of the spirit
[52:21] and of power
[52:24] that your your faith should not stand in
[52:27] the wisdom of man but in the power of
[52:30] God
[52:31] albeit we speak wisdom among them that
[52:34] are perfect yet not the wisdom of this
[52:37] world nor of the prince of this world
[52:40] that cometh do not but we speak the
[52:44] wisdom of God in a mystery even the
[52:47] hidden Mystery which God ordained before
[52:50] the world unto our Glory
[52:54] which none of the princes of this world
[52:56] knew for had they known it they would
[52:59] not have crucified the Lord Of Glory

[1:32:29] more than trying
[1:32:31] the Holy Ghost in you has bring you to
[1:32:34] storms of maturing
[1:32:37] that the Holy Ghost you've received
[1:32:39] becomes incarnated in the person of
[1:32:43] Jesus Christ
[1:32:45] oh Hallelujah we said the baptism of the
[1:32:48] Holy Ghost make way for the Holy Ghost
[1:32:51] himself
[1:32:53] Hallelujah
[1:32:54] Glory yes God Amen yes sir so we talked
[1:33:00] men about you know brother Brandon said
[1:33:02] God brings individual through the same
[1:33:04] process that he brings to church
[1:33:08] from Faith virtue brotherly kindness
[1:33:13] Hallelujah into perfect love
[1:33:17] but I tell you it like this
[1:33:19] everything that you've got need of till
[1:33:21] your translation
[1:33:24] there in the seed
[1:33:25] [Applause]
[1:33:28] yes sir
[1:33:30] he said
[1:33:31] if the lutherans would continue on
[1:33:35] they would become wesleyans
[1:33:38] and if the Westlands that continue
[1:33:40] hallelujah amen there would become
[1:33:44] Pentecost the restoration of the gifts
[1:33:48] is it right and if Pentecost had
[1:33:51] continued they would become the bride
[1:33:56] yes my brother but I tell you Hallelujah
[1:34:01] there's a little bit of Lutheran in you
[1:34:03] there's some Western in you there's a
[1:34:07] Pentecost in you
[1:34:09] [Applause]
[1:34:13] God didn't just throw it away he put
[1:34:17] more on to it because it's more of the
[1:34:20] same life the same life the same life
[1:34:24] that Paul had it's the same life that
[1:34:27] you have
[1:34:28] the same life that was in Jesus it's the
[1:34:31] life in you
[1:34:32] [Applause]
[1:34:34] Hallelujah and there was a falling away
[1:34:37] but you are the restoration of all God
[1:34:41] started and all that
[1:34:45] the kind of waiter that fall into the
[1:34:49] ground and dying
[1:34:51] as repeal seed again
[1:34:54] many membered seed all over the face of
[1:34:57] the Earth
[1:34:58] amen
[1:35:00] hallelujah yes my brother amen
[1:35:04] glory to God so here it is glory to God
[1:35:08] God knows exactly what he's doing with
[1:35:10] you
[1:35:11] amen
[1:35:13] so Paul was telling them that this is
[1:35:16] not just a natural walk
[1:35:19] this is not just a new life motivated by
[1:35:23] your whole life
[1:35:24] no sir
[1:35:27] because the carnal man is enmity
[1:35:31] took off
[1:35:33] and he cannot conform to the things of
[1:35:37] God
[1:35:38] so you're going to step out of the
[1:35:40] carnal into the spiritual
[1:35:43] is that right
[1:35:45] you see the mechanics was there to keep
[1:35:47] you
[1:35:49] until the Dynamics come
[1:35:51] [Applause]
[1:35:54] if the Dynamics was first
[1:35:56] we wouldn't have to preach and tell you
[1:35:59] how to wear your dress
[1:36:00] [Applause]
[1:36:02] nobody had to preach the lipsticks from
[1:36:05] your lips
[1:36:06] and the hearings out of your ears
[1:36:09] if the Dynamics was first
[1:36:11] amen but there was a message of
[1:36:15] restoration
[1:36:17] is that right
[1:36:18] and Paul said you who have prevailed in
[1:36:22] pain
[1:36:23] or in birth until Christ before within
[1:36:27] you
[1:36:28] yes sir and so is it in the church some
[1:36:32] mature before others
[1:36:34] hello somebody
[1:36:36] but let not the mature look at the
[1:36:38] immature and think they are not in it
[1:36:43] bear with one another
[1:36:45] take time with my man

[1:37:26] we watch the Walk of Abraham
[1:37:29] it was justified
[1:37:31] it was sanctified
[1:37:33] then in Genesis 17 God said Abraham

[1:38:16] do is cry
