[29:17] the father is not here he's still back
[29:19] home in the congo
[29:21] lord's willing down the road he will be

[29:26] but the baby is born he is an american
[29:31] and mama is here i have to communicate
[29:33] back and forth with
[29:34] daddy to make sure i got a written
[29:37] permission
[29:39] to dedicate the baby and to make sure
[29:42] everything is lined up
[29:43] in the world if you would for those who
[29:46] are interested
[29:47] mark chapter 10 before the dedication
[29:50] you might be wondering why are we doing
[29:52] this
[29:54] thank you very much you can you know
[29:56] what we're gonna sing
[29:57] bring them in you okay with that okay
[30:05] didn't know i was under training a
[30:08] living word tabernacle
[30:11] mark chapter 10 verse 13
[30:15] and they brought young children to him
[30:19] how many listen to the sermon on
[30:20] wednesday
[30:23] okay praise the lord so you will
[30:25] understand this
[30:26] and they brought the young children to
[30:28] him that he should touch them
[30:30] and his disciples rebuked those that
[30:33] brought them
[30:34] but when jesus saw it he was much
[30:37] displeased and said to them
[30:39] hello the little children remember
[30:42] elijah
[30:43] john the baptist have to bring the faith
[30:45] of the
[30:46] father to the children and that faith
[30:50] we found out that it was jesus christ
[30:52] and in the teaching of jesus christ when
[30:54] he's teaching
[30:55] he's referring to the children he's
[30:57] pointing them to the
[30:59] children everybody there i love the
[31:02] little children to come to
[31:04] me and forbid them not for us of such is
[31:07] the kingdom of god
[31:09] verily i say unto you whatsoe whosoever
[31:12] shall not receive the kingdom of god
[31:14] as a leader child the faith to the
[31:18] children
[31:19] he shall not enter therein verse 16
[31:22] and he took the map in his arm put his
[31:25] hands
[31:25] upon them and blessed them so that's the
[31:29] reason why we're going to take
[31:30] ludo lemuel and we will be blessing him
[31:34] this morning
[31:35] the lord give us this gift and we're
[31:37] going to take it and we turn it back
[31:39] into the hand of god
[31:41] because the bible say that whoever is in
[31:43] the hand of god
[31:44] no one can plug them off so we want to
[31:47] place our children
[31:48] in the hand of god knowing in the
[31:50] promise that nobody can go there
[31:53] and plug them off even though the devil
[31:55] must seems like he's benefiting them
[31:58] but the one who is in control is jesus
[32:00] christ
[32:01] so sister benita you can bring the baby
[32:04] [Music]
[32:12] here

[35:46] if you would now let's turn to the
[35:49] preaching of the word in deuteronomy
[35:52] chapter 18.
[35:59] on wednesday i hope all the young people
[36:03] here
[36:03] because the devil has been targeting the
[36:06] young people
[36:08] with this computer and this website and
[36:11] all kinds of things
[36:12] this age of reasoning i hope the young
[36:15] people were able to look at the
[36:19] sermon on wednesday on wednesday
[36:23] the heart of the father to the children
[36:28] normally i was supposed to take the
[36:30] heart of the children today
[36:32] to the father but we might do that next
[36:34] sunday
[36:35] there is something we need to make sure
[36:37] we log we
[36:38] we put it pretty good so when we go with
[36:41] the heart of the father
[36:43] or the children to the father it will be
[36:46] clear
[36:49] deuteronomy chapter 18 verse 15. if you
[36:53] dare you can say
[36:54] amen praise the lord
[36:57] the lord your god will raise up to you
[37:00] this is moses giving to israel a
[37:04] prophet from the midst of you
[37:07] of your brethren you might be seated
[37:10] so moses is talking to israel that there
[37:13] is a promise for them
[37:15] and we saw on wednesday that according
[37:18] to the promise of god
[37:19] god promised them to send them the
[37:21] messiah
[37:22] and in the book of uh genesis the
[37:25] messiah
[37:26] was the seed of the woman then isaiah
[37:29] down the road came down he said it's
[37:31] going to be a man
[37:32] it's going to be a son it's going to be
[37:34] a child a man child
[37:36] and he gave us his title counselor
[37:39] prince of peace mighty god
[37:41] and all these tithes that we know
[37:43] together but here in deuteronomy chapter
[37:45] 18
[37:46] which will be our main focus today
[37:49] before we go
[37:50] to the heart of the children back to the
[37:51] father this is
[37:53] this will be our main focus today the
[37:55] lord told me to go with
[37:57] one point at a time and i want to
[37:59] acknowledge brother caillou he's with us
[38:02] this morning
[38:05] [Applause]
[38:07] good to see you brother kyle i didn't
[38:10] know you were coming so i told him we
[38:12] need to work together so to have him
[38:14] here to preach for us
[38:15] because we believe in a 5-4 ministry
[38:19] lord's willing if everything goes well
[38:21] on wednesday we will have brother aaron
[38:24] mcgeary
[38:25] to preach for us here on wednesday then
[38:27] i will pick it up on sunday
[38:30] amen so if you can let's make sure we're
[38:33] in the house of god
[38:35] i know everybody is in fear of
[38:36] coronavirus
[38:38] but we are going to work we spend more
[38:41] time at work
[38:43] than a church so
[38:47] if you put a mask going over there
[38:50] also you can come here and put a mask
[38:54] are you there somebody might say brother
[38:57] stephen
[38:58] but if your faith is not there yet you
[39:02] can stay at home
[39:03] and continue to streaming i am not
[39:05] condemning anyone
[39:06] but i'm encouraging if you can just make
[39:09] it to church
[39:11] so it will be a support for our brother
[39:13] amen
[39:15] now uh deuteronomy 18 he said the lord
[39:18] your god will raise up to you a
[39:21] prophet so moses is giving us a
[39:23] description here
[39:25] that this man this messiah that will be
[39:28] coming will be a
[39:30] prophet everybody clear and he saved
[39:33] from the midst of you of your brethren
[39:35] so that prophet will be a jew
[39:38] by nature right from the tribe of judah
[39:43] but there is a mystery connected to that
[39:47] of your brethren like unto me
[39:50] this is the key we're going to be
[39:51] dealing with it today a
[39:53] prophet like
[39:57] unto me unto me who is me
[40:01] so this prophet will be in a caliber
[40:05] of moses are you there
[40:09] if you miss this you're gonna have a
[40:10] trouble down the road
[40:12] are you there so a prophet like unto me
[40:17] to him you shall hearken
[40:20] so this prophet will be like moses what
[40:24] does it mean
[40:25] to be like moses and when he comes
[40:28] everybody must hear him
[40:32] you must harken unto him everybody there
[40:36] verse 16 according to all that you
[40:40] desire
[40:41] of the lord your god in horeb we already
[40:44] explained this
[40:45] that's why in malachi 4 the bible say
[40:48] remember the law
[40:50] of moses him because in arab
[40:53] israel say we don't want god to talk to
[40:56] us
[40:56] from now on we want god to talk to us
[40:59] through a
[41:00] prophet so god say according to what you
[41:03] desired in
[41:04] arab i'm gonna send you a prophet but
[41:07] that prophet will be in the caliber
[41:09] of moses and we know that prophet is
[41:12] jesus christ which is
[41:14] higher than moses but his caliber
[41:17] is like unto moses so you need to look
[41:21] what is in moses
[41:23] are you there and make sure whatever was
[41:26] in moses
[41:27] was in christ we clear now
[41:32] in horeb the day of the assembly saying
[41:35] let me not hear again the voice of the
[41:37] lord my god
[41:39] neither let's let me see this great fire
[41:42] anymore
[41:42] so there was a fire there there was the
[41:45] voice of the lord
[41:46] in horup there and something happened
[41:48] israel say
[41:49] we don't want to hear it anymore so in
[41:51] malachi 4 when they say remember the law
[41:54] they're not telling you that moses is
[41:56] coming moses
[41:58] is coming to the jewish people but god
[42:00] is reminding you like
[42:02] go back to oreb and remember what
[42:04] happened in aurib
[42:05] behold i will send you elijah prophet
[42:09] i'm sending you a prophet why because
[42:12] you requested that
[42:13] if i want to speak to you i must talk to
[42:16] you through a
[42:17] prophet are we clear
[42:20] okay praise the lord
[42:23] uh verse 17 and the lord said to him
[42:26] they have well spoken that which they
[42:29] have spoken
[42:31] i will raise them up a prophet from
[42:32] among their brethren
[42:34] like to you why is this prophet
[42:37] like moses and will put my word in his
[42:41] mouth
[42:42] and he shall speak to them all that i
[42:44] have i shall command him
[42:47] and it shall come to pass that whosoever
[42:49] will not
[42:50] hearken so you must heal
[42:53] the prophet that's why in mont
[42:56] transfiguration the voice came he said
[42:59] behold behold who
[43:04] might hear what hear ye him
[43:08] because you must hear this prophet
[43:11] everybody clear
[43:12] okay hearken to my word which he shall
[43:15] speak in my name
[43:16] i will require it of him in other words
[43:19] if you don't listen to this prophet
[43:22] you're going to be dealing with god
[43:24] everybody clear
[43:26] okay so we our theme what we are dealing
[43:28] with is
[43:29] a prophet like unto moses
[43:32] you must understand this then when we
[43:35] take returning the heart of the
[43:37] children to the father everything is
[43:39] clear everybody there
[43:40] so today we are dealing now we are
[43:42] entering into brother brother
[43:45] we finished john the baptist part one
[43:47] two three now it's brother branham
[43:50] let's go to luke chapter 18.
[43:57] so young people go back and look at part
[44:00] 15
[44:00] 16 17 it's clearing john the baptist
[44:05] but we found out the spirit of john the
[44:07] baptist preached marriage and divorce
[44:09] the spirit in john the baptist have
[44:11] questioned and answered
[44:12] the spirit in john the baptist preached
[44:14] the serpenty
[44:17] are you there we prove to you all of
[44:20] that
[44:21] let's go to luke 18.
[44:26] sometimes the devil thinks he's doing
[44:28] something he just triggered a different
[44:30] anointing
[44:34] luke 18 chapter 7
[44:37] and shall not god avenge his own elect
[44:41] he's talking about the elect remember
[44:44] people are saying malachi 4
[44:46] is for the jewish the 144 000 that's
[44:49] wrong
[44:51] you go to revelation seven the hundred
[44:53] and forty four thousand are
[44:54] servant they are not children
[44:58] are we there and shall not avenge
[45:02] his own elect so this is the elect
[45:05] if he was not positive he should deceive
[45:07] the e
[45:08] let if he was not you see that
[45:11] we're talking about the elect the elect
[45:14] which cried there and not to him
[45:17] do he bear long with them verse 8
[45:21] i tell you that he will avenge them
[45:23] speedily
[45:24] nevertheless when the son of man
[45:28] cometh so there is a coming of the son
[45:32] of man shall he find faith
[45:35] on earth it is telling you that faith
[45:38] will be destroyed so the son of man is
[45:42] worrying
[45:43] not to help his children but his
[45:45] worrying is when i come should i find
[45:48] faith so somebody must be there to
[45:51] restore
[45:52] faith back are we there
[45:56] praise the lord let's go to galatians 3.
[46:00] this is a refreshing for wednesday
[46:04] and then we will be praying you need
[46:07] your bible with you
[46:09] galatians 3 if you dare you can say amen
[46:12] verse 23 but before faith
[46:15] comes faith was not there
[46:19] faith came we explained this on
[46:20] wednesday are you there
[46:22] before faith came we were kept
[46:26] under the law so when jesus christ came
[46:30] jesus was
[46:31] faith that's why john the baptist has to
[46:34] take the father
[46:35] and point them to jesus christ which was
[46:38] the theft
[46:40] praise the lord we were kept shut up
[46:45] uh verse 23 under the law shut up to the
[46:48] faith
[46:50] which should afterward be revealed
[46:53] in christ verse 24 wherefore the law
[46:56] was a school master to bring us to
[46:59] christ everybody there that we might be
[47:03] justified by faith
[47:04] but after that faith is come after jesus
[47:08] christ come everybody there
[47:11] we are no longer under the school master
[47:13] we are no longer under the law
[47:15] for you are all children you see now
[47:19] it's not dealing with jews only now it's
[47:22] children
[47:23] of god by faith in christ jesus
[47:26] for as many of you as have been baptized
[47:29] into christ how do you baptize into
[47:32] christ by one
[47:33] spirit we are all baptized that's why
[47:36] john say
[47:37] i cannot do it but one is coming that
[47:40] person will baptize you with the
[47:42] holy ghost the lord will enter his
[47:45] temple
[47:46] suddenly we're now clear on that
[47:51] have been baptized into christ have put
[47:53] on christ
[47:55] there is neither jew that jewish
[47:57] dispensation is
[47:59] completely over there is neither jew nor
[48:02] greek
[48:02] there is neither born nor free there is
[48:05] neither male nor
[48:06] female for you are all one in christ
[48:09] jesus and if you be christ then
[48:12] you are abraham seed
[48:15] abraham was before israel you see now
[48:19] abraham's seed and hair according to the
[48:21] promise
[48:22] i want you to go to verse 14 if you can
[48:26] that the blessing of abraham might come
[48:30] under gender through jesus christ
[48:34] that faith that we might receive the
[48:37] promise of the
[48:39] everybody clear now the firmness of the
[48:41] spirit through what
[48:43] so faith have to come to open the door
[48:46] for the holy ghost to enter
[48:48] not only to the jewish people but also
[48:50] to the
[48:51] gentile are you there we've seen that
[48:54] jesus was the temple of god
[48:56] but in the day of pentecost they also
[48:58] saw 120
[49:00] temple in the old testament when the
[49:02] pillar of fire came
[49:03] he deviated the people and anointed the
[49:06] temple
[49:07] but when the sacrifice the prophet
[49:09] sacrificed the lamb
[49:10] was crucified when that same pillar of
[49:13] fire came down
[49:15] into the same temple he deviated the
[49:18] temple
[49:18] now we went to 120 people
[49:21] why the blessing of abraham now can be
[49:24] given to the
[49:26] gentile everybody clear so far now let's
[49:29] pray
[49:30] heavenly father lord we thank you again
[49:33] for your grace your love your mercy
[49:35] and for everything you're doing for us
[49:37] lord father here you have given us
[49:39] another opportunity to gather together
[49:41] lord
[49:42] before the coming of the lord to take
[49:44] your children
[49:45] all the way lord home father we were
[49:48] rebuking
[49:49] every demonic spirit everything that can
[49:52] bring your children to
[49:54] an atmosphere of destruction or
[49:57] lord father sleepness or all kinds of
[49:59] things lord
[50:00] that is contrary to your word father we
[50:02] rebuke it from this place to the dry
[50:05] places in the name of jesus christ
[50:07] lord as a shepherd i ask forgiveness
[50:10] lord forgiveness for myself and
[50:12] forgiveness for your children
[50:14] if there is anything in our life that we
[50:17] did
[50:17] that might block the blessing or clog a
[50:20] channel this morning lord
[50:21] may you forgive us lord may the channel
[50:24] of heaven be completely open lord
[50:26] and may your spirit be outpoured again
[50:29] this morning lord
[50:30] changing the life of your children
[50:32] sealing your children
[50:33] healing your children stabilizing
[50:36] opening the eyes lord father
[50:38] in the name of jesus christ may the holy
[50:41] spirit
[50:41] may the inside teacher come down lord
[50:44] may you open and unveil and reveal your
[50:46] word to your children
[50:47] in the name of jesus christ amen
[50:50] god bless you all we greet you all in
[50:54] the name of jesus christ
[50:55] and we appreciate every visitor this
[50:57] morning
[50:58] now on part we are now dealing with part
[51:02] 18 the unchanging pattern of god
[51:05] as we stated we are placing the basis
[51:08] everybody can see the screen clear
[51:10] now in the message absolute brother
[51:13] bradham say in the day that we are
[51:14] living in now
[51:16] and everything is so breaking up so
[51:19] fragile
[51:20] and carried away and i think that this
[51:23] message
[51:23] absolute will be a very appropriate
[51:26] thing
[51:27] especially to christians when they are
[51:29] going through their deep waters
[51:31] now the christian church is passing
[51:34] through the deepest water
[51:36] it's head for the last 2000 years
[51:39] because we are coming to a spot
[51:41] to where there is something presented to
[51:44] christianity
[51:46] something they have to make a decision
[51:48] on it's a message
[51:50] and i think that the christian church
[51:52] ought to have something
[51:54] that they know that they are tied to
[51:58] instead of just floating about like a
[52:00] leaf
[52:01] upon the water the wind as the bible say
[52:04] carried about with every wind of
[52:06] doctrine
[52:07] the wind comes and blows the leaf the
[52:10] little leaf this way
[52:11] and then another wind comes another wind
[52:14] comes
[52:14] the north wind the suffering the east
[52:17] wind
[52:18] the west wind you shall never get
[52:20] anywhere
[52:21] you are not stable are you there so
[52:24] there are trouble that are coming
[52:26] troubling the water we must make sure we
[52:29] are tied up to something
[52:30] that is solid and there is nothing solid
[52:33] but crust
[52:35] everybody clear so the christian life
[52:38] should be a stable life
[52:40] it should be something that's a
[52:42] principle
[52:43] that you are tied to it that is more
[52:46] than life
[52:47] itself that's why we are clarifying this
[52:50] to make sure
[52:51] you understand why we need the message
[52:54] what was the purpose of the message and
[52:57] why we need to be tight
[52:59] and hooked and connected to the message
[53:01] of the hour
[53:02] now on wednesday we seen that israel
[53:06] had seven church ages if you miss this
[53:09] you need to go listen to the tab
[53:11] and we found also that the gentile have
[53:14] also
[53:14] seven church ages and we prove to you in
[53:17] the bible
[53:18] and by the quote of brother branham that
[53:20] israel
[53:21] in the wilderness was the church of god
[53:24] just like the gentile also
[53:26] was to have a church it was the church
[53:28] of god
[53:29] now when the church of israel started it
[53:32] started with a prophet called
[53:34] moses and when the church of the gentile
[53:37] also started
[53:38] it started with a prophet called paul
[53:41] and we know that paul brother branham
[53:43] explained to us that he was our modern
[53:46] moses everybody clear moses met the
[53:50] pillar of fire
[53:51] paul met the pillar of fire moses wrote
[53:54] the books
[53:55] paul also wrote the books are you there
[53:57] but we found out that toward
[53:59] the end of the gentile of the jewish
[54:01] dispensation
[54:03] there is a spirit of elijah that came
[54:05] down
[54:06] and that elijah was called john the
[54:08] baptist
[54:09] and we prove to you also through the
[54:11] seal and through the series
[54:13] that there is also a spirit of elijah
[54:16] coming to the gentile
[54:17] before the coming of the lord moses
[54:20] prophesy
[54:20] about the coming of the lord and paul
[54:23] also prophesy about the coming of the
[54:26] lord
[54:26] but before the lord comes elijah must
[54:29] come
[54:30] before the lord comes again elijah must
[54:32] come
[54:33] before the lord comes to israel elijah
[54:36] also must again
[54:37] come because god does not change
[54:40] he's the same yesterday today and
[54:43] forever
[54:43] so the church of israel was under the
[54:46] dispensation of the lord
[54:48] but the church of the gentile was under
[54:50] the dispensation of
[54:52] grace and we explained on wednesday that
[54:55] even though
[54:56] israel was still under the dispensation
[54:59] of the law
[54:59] because of the fact that spirit don't
[55:02] die
[55:02] the nicolet and spirit attack the jewish
[55:06] church you remember the sermon on
[55:08] wednesday and the nicolet and spirit
[55:10] attacked and entered through the elder
[55:13] because before the death of moses
[55:15] moses called the elders and told them
[55:18] that i know after my departure
[55:20] you guys are gonna leave the faith and
[55:23] paul also before he dies he called the
[55:25] elder
[55:26] and he said before i leave i know that
[55:28] you're gonna depart from the faith
[55:30] and we found out that in the days of
[55:32] samuel
[55:33] when samuel started over there the elder
[55:36] came
[55:37] they waited until the prophet's son
[55:40] commit arrow and they took opportunity
[55:44] by the era of the prophet son to reject
[55:48] samuel it is the same spirit today
[55:52] people usually have a tendency to attack
[55:55] jeffersonville to attack the prophet son
[55:59] and to use that reason in order to
[56:02] depart or to reject the brother branham
[56:05] and the prophet the bible explained to
[56:07] us that when they rejected samuel
[56:10] god said that it is not samuel that you
[56:12] are rejecting
[56:13] you are actually rejecting me everybody
[56:16] clear
[56:17] so when the spirit begin to work in
[56:20] israel
[56:21] israel asked that they want to be like
[56:23] other
[56:24] nations they don't want to be like the
[56:26] message of the hour
[56:28] the message of the hour is too hard for
[56:30] them
[56:31] the message of the hour is too tight
[56:33] from them
[56:34] they want to be like the nomination they
[56:36] want to be on tv
[56:38] they want to wear pants they want to do
[56:40] all kinds of stuff like the other women
[56:42] and they want and they took opportunity
[56:45] to bring it to samuel
[56:46] like they are really concerned about the
[56:49] children of samuel
[56:50] but they were not concerned about the
[56:51] children of samuel
[56:53] they were just trying to introduce
[56:55] another kingdom and reject the messiah
[56:58] kingdom
[56:59] that was overruling upon them everybody
[57:01] clear
[57:02] so since that spirit entered went
[57:05] through the church ages
[57:06] through ahab through jezebel keep going
[57:09] all the way before jesus christ came
[57:13] israel was completely divided into
[57:17] many denominations are you there moses
[57:20] gave them only
[57:21] one book of the law are you there
[57:25] but before jesus christ came they have
[57:28] the sadducees
[57:29] they have the pharisees they have the
[57:31] rehearsian
[57:32] this one doesn't believe the angel this
[57:35] one doesn't believe the resurrection
[57:37] this one doesn't believe this and this
[57:39] is until
[57:40] israel was completely lost
[57:43] but god already tested a ministry
[57:47] in the old testament which is the
[57:49] ministry of elijah
[57:51] it is a ministry that is specialized
[57:54] into bringing the heart of a nation
[57:56] of a people and bring that heart back
[57:59] again to god
[58:00] that's why elijah must come
[58:04] but this elijah was john the baptist to
[58:07] take the heart
[58:08] of the father the father were pharisee
[58:11] the father were scrabbled they were
[58:13] herodian they were sadducees
[58:15] all kind of denomination and bring the
[58:18] father back again to the
[58:20] faith are you there and we found the
[58:23] same thing in the church ages
[58:25] where paul spoke about the grievous wolf
[58:28] which was the same spirit of the
[58:30] antichrist
[58:31] now we know it's the anticlass because
[58:34] the seals are broken
[58:35] but when israel was battling with it
[58:38] they didn't know what was going on
[58:40] are you there so that spirit started
[58:42] again
[58:43] and before the second coming of the lord
[58:45] we found out that we have
[58:47] more than 900 denominations
[58:50] in america we have presbyterian we have
[58:53] baptists we have methodists we have
[58:55] catholics
[58:56] we have oneness we have two nurses we
[58:58] have three nuts
[58:59] until everybody is confused so another
[59:02] elijah must come
[59:05] to return the heart of the children back
[59:07] to the faith everybody clear
[59:09] but we found out that before the coming
[59:12] of john the baptist
[59:14] the holy spirit was already moving into
[59:17] the land
[59:18] when he moved he moved into the family
[59:20] of zechariah
[59:22] he moved into the family of elizabeth he
[59:24] moved into the family of simeon
[59:27] he moved into the family of anna but
[59:29] when the holy spirit was moving there
[59:32] the holy spirit was filling them and
[59:35] they were
[59:36] prophesying the holy spirit was not
[59:39] sealing them
[59:40] because it was not the time of the
[59:42] sealing of the holy spirit
[59:44] the holy spirit was only activating the
[59:48] gift
[59:49] of the spirit that's why when if you
[59:52] notice when simeon went into the temple
[59:55] simeon was giving only a promise that
[59:58] he will see the messiah before his
[1:00:01] death in other words simeon was under
[1:00:04] the anointing of
[1:00:06] death are you there he's going to
[1:00:09] experience the messiah
[1:00:11] he's going to see the messiah but after
[1:00:13] seeing the baby born
[1:00:15] he's gonna die are you there which is
[1:00:18] the pentecostal spirit of the shark
[1:00:21] it is a spirit that carries the baby it
[1:00:24] is a spirit
[1:00:25] that carries the seed but after a while
[1:00:27] it must be church from the seed
[1:00:30] and die into denomination and let the
[1:00:33] seed continue to grow
[1:00:34] so the move of the spirit is only for
[1:00:37] the restoration
[1:00:39] of their gift that's why in
[1:00:42] azusa street when the pentecostal
[1:00:44] movement starts
[1:00:45] brother branham said that movement came
[1:00:48] to restore the gift of the
[1:00:50] spirit but that was not the thing
[1:00:53] because
[1:00:53] elijah must come and when elijah come
[1:00:57] elijah will
[1:00:58] introduce the messiah and when he
[1:01:00] introduced the messiah he's going to
[1:01:02] bring the faith
[1:01:03] back again to the first day original
[1:01:05] faith are you there
[1:01:06] so the move of the spirit in henna all
[1:01:10] of them was just
[1:01:11] to activate gift that's why if you check
[1:01:14] the bible you will see
[1:01:15] and elizabeth begin to prophesy and
[1:01:18] simeon begin to profess her
[1:01:20] and anna begin to prove all of them and
[1:01:22] i was a
[1:01:23] prophetess it was a gift of the
[1:01:27] spirit which is a similar anointing on
[1:01:31] the pentecostal
[1:01:32] people the holy spirit was moving
[1:01:35] but that was not the true restoration
[1:01:38] it was just to restore or to quicken the
[1:01:42] gift of the
[1:01:43] spirit until faith came and when the
[1:01:46] faith came we found out that faith was
[1:01:49] crushed are you there now the key is
[1:01:52] this before we move on
[1:01:54] because we were trying to find out what
[1:01:56] is that
[1:01:57] faithful on wednesday we explained first
[1:02:00] of all
[1:02:02] that that faith was the restoration of
[1:02:05] the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:02:09] are you there because john the baptist
[1:02:13] have a message
[1:02:14] repentance what the baptism about
[1:02:17] and also the holy ghost and he pointed
[1:02:20] to them
[1:02:21] and the first one who was baptized and
[1:02:24] the holy ghost
[1:02:25] enter and seal him was the lord jesus
[1:02:27] christ
[1:02:28] are you there and on the day of
[1:02:30] pentecost when peter came out
[1:02:32] peter took now the prescription of john
[1:02:35] and begin to upgrade the prescription
[1:02:38] he said john said to be baptized but
[1:02:40] john didn't have a name
[1:02:42] so the baptist must be in the name of
[1:02:44] jesus christ
[1:02:46] for the remission of sin so he have to
[1:02:49] upgrade the prescription
[1:02:50] and that promise was unto you and to
[1:02:53] your children
[1:02:54] and as many as the lord your god shall
[1:02:56] call
[1:02:57] so the coming of jesus christ opened the
[1:03:00] door
[1:03:01] for the genuine baptism of the holy
[1:03:04] ghost into the
[1:03:05] believer that was the original
[1:03:08] faith so if we go back to the faith
[1:03:12] we must go back to the genuine baptism
[1:03:16] of the
[1:03:17] holy ghost are you there
[1:03:20] all right now this is the problem
[1:03:23] brother brown i'm saying in the message
[1:03:25] cross the mystery of god with you
[1:03:28] brother branham said that god had a
[1:03:29] threefold purpose
[1:03:32] he said the first purpose was he have to
[1:03:34] reveal himself in
[1:03:35] christ which he did in the river of
[1:03:38] jordan
[1:03:39] the spirit of the lord entered there and
[1:03:41] then christ began his ministry
[1:03:43] then brother branham said the second
[1:03:45] reason we have to have
[1:03:47] preeminence into his blood in his church
[1:03:50] which is the body the bread
[1:03:52] still he could have preeminence to
[1:03:54] express himself through
[1:03:55] them and we found out that in the day of
[1:03:58] pentecost
[1:03:59] the holy spirit came and entered into
[1:04:01] the church
[1:04:03] are you there but the third reason here
[1:04:06] the brother branham said that thirdly to
[1:04:10] restore the kingdom
[1:04:12] to its rightly position
[1:04:15] that fell by sin by the first
[1:04:18] adam so if we cross this just like that
[1:04:22] we're gonna be missing something but let
[1:04:25] me drop this
[1:04:27] and then i'm going to explain it to you
[1:04:30] adam
[1:04:31] had two things i want you to understand
[1:04:34] this
[1:04:35] very good because adam fell
[1:04:39] and when jesus christ came jesus had to
[1:04:42] restore
[1:04:44] everything that adam fell
[1:04:47] but you need to understand what did adam
[1:04:52] have
[1:04:54] are you there you can go to somebody you
[1:04:57] say give me my stuff
[1:04:58] what is your stuff are you there you
[1:05:01] must know that
[1:05:02] you need this this and this and be very
[1:05:05] specific
[1:05:07] are we clear so adam in the garden of
[1:05:10] eden
[1:05:11] first of all there was the tree of life
[1:05:16] which was connected to eternal life
[1:05:20] are you there so this tree of
[1:05:24] life when adam sinned the way to the
[1:05:27] tree of life was blocked
[1:05:30] are you there because god requires a
[1:05:33] penalty
[1:05:34] somebody must die a lamb must die
[1:05:37] in order to redeem and to open up the
[1:05:40] way
[1:05:40] but we found out that through the law
[1:05:42] lambs were dying
[1:05:44] over and over and nothing happened until
[1:05:47] in the time of john the baptist
[1:05:49] then john luke he said behold the lamb
[1:05:51] of god that take away the sin of the
[1:05:53] world and when jesus christ came and
[1:05:56] died
[1:05:56] the veil of the temple was whipped
[1:05:59] together
[1:06:00] opening the way to the tree of life
[1:06:03] i am the way i am the life and i am the
[1:06:07] truth are you there that's number one
[1:06:10] that one was
[1:06:11] restored that's the reason why we have
[1:06:14] access to the baptism of the
[1:06:16] holy ghost that's why when the mother of
[1:06:19] the son of zebedee
[1:06:20] asked jesus christ jesus said yes
[1:06:23] you want to drink of my cup and you also
[1:06:26] will be baptized with
[1:06:27] the same baptism that i am baptized with
[1:06:31] are you there that was clear but the
[1:06:34] other problem is this
[1:06:36] that in the garden of eden adam
[1:06:40] was given the earth
[1:06:43] if you need the scripture you see me but
[1:06:46] whenever they give you a property
[1:06:49] there is a tattered deed
[1:06:52] are you there that is connected to the
[1:06:55] property
[1:06:56] so the second thing that was in eden
[1:07:00] is the tata deal are you there
[1:07:04] now when jesus christ came jesus
[1:07:07] only paid the price for
[1:07:10] the tata deal but jesus
[1:07:14] never brought the tragedy
[1:07:20] before we get to elijah you need to
[1:07:23] understand
[1:07:24] this it is clear
[1:07:28] hallelujah christ has redeemers
[1:07:34] we are now redeemed everybody believes
[1:07:36] that
[1:07:38] but he has not claimed
[1:07:41] his possession because what happened
[1:07:44] when adam sinned adam had the tattoo
[1:07:48] thing
[1:07:49] and he was speaking to the mountain
[1:07:51] doing this doing the
[1:07:53] doing this no problem when adam sinned
[1:07:56] the tata did left the hand of adam
[1:08:00] and when the devil wanna take hold of it
[1:08:03] the doctor did say your hands are dirty
[1:08:07] you are not supposed to touch me so the
[1:08:10] tattered he went
[1:08:11] back to the original owner and the
[1:08:14] original owner was sitting on the trunk
[1:08:16] and he got the chatter deal and he said
[1:08:19] somebody must pay the price
[1:08:21] before i return the tattered d back
[1:08:25] are you there but when jesus christ came
[1:08:28] he paid only the price he
[1:08:31] opened up this mark he checked
[1:08:34] but this mark was still locked
[1:08:39] that's why elijah when he comes
[1:08:43] he's going to restore all things
[1:08:47] not only restore you to the faith of the
[1:08:51] holy ghost
[1:08:52] but the elijah must make sure that
[1:08:55] everything even the terrorist must come
[1:08:58] down
[1:09:00] we understand clear now okay
[1:09:04] now but he has not claimed his
[1:09:06] possession yet
[1:09:08] now you might die fair with that but
[1:09:10] just hold on a minute
[1:09:12] we'll see he has not claimed it see
[1:09:15] if he took the book of redemption
[1:09:18] everything that adam had and never think
[1:09:22] that
[1:09:22] he he lost cross with jim's back
[1:09:25] and he has already redeemers but bottom
[1:09:28] is remembering that
[1:09:29] but he has not took the possession
[1:09:32] yet he cannot until the appointed
[1:09:37] time are you there because if the book
[1:09:41] the tattoo was came with jesus christ
[1:09:45] everything will stop reading are you
[1:09:48] there
[1:09:49] okay no problem he cannot until the
[1:09:53] appointed time
[1:09:54] and then will come the resurrection and
[1:09:56] then the earth will be
[1:09:58] renewed again so the thirty
[1:10:01] is connected to the resurrection
[1:10:05] are you there because the first
[1:10:09] thing he revealed himself to christ the
[1:10:12] second
[1:10:13] thing he revealed himself through the
[1:10:15] bread but the third thing
[1:10:17] we must go back again to eden but you
[1:10:20] cannot go back to eden
[1:10:22] only with the holy ghost you must go
[1:10:25] back to eden
[1:10:26] also with the title deed
[1:10:30] are you there then we're gonna be like
[1:10:32] adam
[1:10:33] then we're gonna leave for a thousand
[1:10:35] years are you there
[1:10:37] that's why it is a threefold purpose
[1:10:40] dawn in christ
[1:10:41] dawning abroad but before we go back to
[1:10:44] everything
[1:10:45] the tata d must go back to the one he
[1:10:48] was supposed to be given
[1:10:51] everybody clear and then he shall take
[1:10:54] possession
[1:10:55] his possession which he got when he
[1:10:57] redeem us but we'll do it
[1:10:59] at the appointed time everybody clear
[1:11:03] praise the lord that's why we must
[1:11:06] understand when they say
[1:11:08] a prophet like unto moses
[1:11:12] you ready now now you're going to be
[1:11:14] preaching with me
[1:11:17] praise god we have moses on top there
[1:11:21] we have jesus christ when jesus died and
[1:11:24] rose again
[1:11:26] brother branham said the anointing the
[1:11:29] influence of the anointing of the son of
[1:11:31] man
[1:11:32] drop into paul like the lion anointing
[1:11:35] are you there no problem
[1:11:38] all right now moses was a prophet
[1:11:42] everybody agree with me moses
[1:11:46] met the pillar of fire everybody agree
[1:11:48] with me
[1:11:49] when moses was born they killed children
[1:11:54] you agree with me moses have three sons
[1:11:59] i explained this already we preach on
[1:12:00] this those sons
[1:12:02] in our day we call them the pools
[1:12:05] we already explained to that everybody
[1:12:07] there
[1:12:08] moses was initiated
[1:12:12] and next to this everybody is following
[1:12:15] me
[1:12:16] praise the lord moses had the power
[1:12:19] to create things
[1:12:23] a prophet like unto moses
[1:12:26] everybody clear moses gave
[1:12:29] israel the manner that fell from heaven
[1:12:34] everybody clear moses went
[1:12:37] into a mountain come more horrible
[1:12:41] and a cloud met moses there
[1:12:45] a prophet like unto moses
[1:12:48] are you there moses when he went he have
[1:12:51] two table of the law
[1:12:53] we already explained this one was
[1:12:55] written
[1:12:56] and one was unwritten are we there clear
[1:13:00] praise the lord moses also took a poll
[1:13:04] everybody there and put a snake on top
[1:13:07] of the pole
[1:13:08] and raised the snake for israel
[1:13:12] everybody there which was speaking about
[1:13:14] the crucifixion
[1:13:16] of jesus christ we're clear
[1:13:20] no problem moses was dead
[1:13:23] and moses was resurrected
[1:13:27] amen on one evil that's why your on one
[1:13:31] transfiguration
[1:13:32] moses was there and jude opened up the
[1:13:36] mystery to us
[1:13:37] he says that tomorrow night michael the
[1:13:40] archangel was there
[1:13:42] because at the shout at the voice of the
[1:13:45] archangel
[1:13:47] are you there a prophet like unto who
[1:13:51] moses let's go to jesus christ
[1:13:56] was jesus a prophet check mark
[1:14:01] when jesus was born did baby die
[1:14:05] praise the lord did jesus have three
[1:14:08] pulls
[1:14:10] let me help you up jesus ministry
[1:14:15] consisted of three polls
[1:14:19] did you know that notice and be sincere
[1:14:22] if you ever was in your life now for a
[1:14:25] minute few minutes
[1:14:26] his first pull was healing the seat we
[1:14:29] already explained this in detail
[1:14:32] he became very popular man
[1:14:36] everybody there the ministry of healing
[1:14:40] is always popular
[1:14:44] the problem that people have brought
[1:14:46] with brother branham
[1:14:47] is not about the healing ministry
[1:14:50] the problem they have with is about the
[1:14:53] second
[1:14:54] and the third pool are you there because
[1:14:57] if you notice
[1:14:59] when jesus christ died jesus was placed
[1:15:02] into the womb and he was sealed by the
[1:15:05] roman
[1:15:07] are you there the roman seal was put on
[1:15:10] the tomb
[1:15:10] and it was closed completely then the
[1:15:13] soldier was there
[1:15:14] and when the resurrection of jesus
[1:15:16] christ came the mighty angel came down
[1:15:20] the military service of that time
[1:15:24] witness the coming down of the mighty
[1:15:27] angel
[1:15:29] i hope you caught that are you there the
[1:15:32] military
[1:15:33] of that time the military service of the
[1:15:37] time of jesus christ
[1:15:39] they witnessed the coming down of the
[1:15:42] maori
[1:15:42] and jeff and the witness the breaking of
[1:15:46] the seal that they married
[1:15:50] are you there when the military reported
[1:15:54] that to the church the clergy
[1:15:57] are you there the clergy corrupted them
[1:16:00] to tell a wrong story to deny
[1:16:05] the evidence that they first saw
[1:16:08] are you there that's why when the cloud
[1:16:11] came on sunset mountain are you there
[1:16:14] it was completely clarified that the
[1:16:17] angel of the lord came but they are
[1:16:20] using the military again
[1:16:23] saying that it was the army that was
[1:16:26] destroying the rocket
[1:16:28] they are again using the soldier they
[1:16:31] are again using the military
[1:16:34] in order to reject the coming down of
[1:16:37] the mighty angel
[1:16:38] to break the seal spirit
[1:16:42] don't die are you there but the soldiers
[1:16:46] saw it
[1:16:47] but they also tell a lie so you better
[1:16:50] know what you are listening to it the
[1:16:53] military can be corrupted
[1:16:55] because they were corrupted in the time
[1:16:57] of jesus
[1:16:58] they saw the mandatory the witness said
[1:17:02] they saw the breaking of the seal then
[1:17:04] they turn around and say no
[1:17:06] he was his disciple it was a rocket that
[1:17:08] we were destroying
[1:17:10] everybody there the first pool was the
[1:17:13] healing of the sick
[1:17:15] he became a very popular man everybody
[1:17:18] believe him
[1:17:20] seems like seems like is that right
[1:17:24] went he fought when he went forth
[1:17:27] healing the sick
[1:17:28] everybody wanted him in the church
[1:17:31] that's why brother branham said be very
[1:17:33] sensitive
[1:17:34] in other words the read between the line
[1:17:36] you will understand my ministry
[1:17:38] but one day he turned around and start
[1:17:41] prophesying we explained to you that
[1:17:44] discerning of the spirit and prophecy
[1:17:46] was the same
[1:17:47] praise the lord which is the second poor
[1:17:49] for he was the
[1:17:51] word and he was the prophet the moses
[1:17:55] again moses and when he went to tell
[1:17:58] them
[1:17:59] and they tell and tell them how they was
[1:18:02] living
[1:18:03] and the things they were doing he become
[1:18:05] very
[1:18:06] unpopular are you there
[1:18:09] when it comes to the healing of the sick
[1:18:11] brother branham is a good prophet
[1:18:14] brother branham pray for my mother that
[1:18:17] one you can't deny
[1:18:19] brother when i pray for my father but i
[1:18:21] want to pray for my uncle
[1:18:23] but we have a problem with his teaching
[1:18:31] that was his second poll
[1:18:34] the second was rebuking the organization
[1:18:38] and prophesying what they had done what
[1:18:40] they were and what was
[1:18:42] coming 279 but his
[1:18:46] third pool was when he preached to the
[1:18:48] lost
[1:18:49] that could not say be saved no more in
[1:18:52] other words jesus have also
[1:18:54] three balls everybody there jesus a
[1:18:57] prophet
[1:18:58] moses a prophet moses have three pools
[1:19:02] jesus also have three poor check

[1:19:19] of the covenant jesus christ in the form
[1:19:22] of god

[1:19:30] form
[1:19:31] that he was back there bringing that
[1:19:34] first
[1:19:35] exodus bringing the second accident
[1:19:39] and here he is with there
[1:19:42] the third doctor that is here
[1:19:46] i'm going slowly everybody there the
[1:19:50] first
[1:19:50] exodus what did he do what did the
[1:19:54] pillar of fire do
[1:19:55] he brought them out of a natural land
[1:19:59] to a natural land egypt into
[1:20:02] palestine the second exodus
[1:20:06] he brought them out from a spiritual
[1:20:09] condition are you there into
[1:20:12] a spiritual baptism after
[1:20:16] a spiritual baptism of them

[1:20:30] with the
[1:20:32] everybody clear second exodus third
[1:20:35] exodus now he is bringing them
[1:20:39] from the spiritual baptism of the holy
[1:20:42] ghost
[1:20:43] right back to the eternal land of the
[1:20:46] millennium and the great here but to go
[1:20:50] back to the millennium you need there
[1:20:57] are we clear brother branham help me
[1:21:00] again
[1:21:02] the holy spirit in the form of the
[1:21:04] pillar of fire
[1:21:05] god coming down in manifestation brought
[1:21:09] out the first exodus
[1:21:11] brought israel out of egypt the second
[1:21:14] exodus
[1:21:15] was christ bringing the church out of
[1:21:17] what
[1:21:18] judaism that's why john the baptist
[1:21:22] pulled them from the law and put them
[1:21:24] into
[1:21:25] christ and christ initiates the exodus
[1:21:29] say moses spoke the lord said this like
[1:21:32] i
[1:21:33] tell you are you there they say over
[1:21:36] there i try to fortune but i'll tell you
[1:21:39] pulling them out of what judaism
[1:21:42] everybody there
[1:21:44] the third exodus is when the same
[1:21:47] pillar of fire takes the bride from the
[1:21:51] church out of the natural that's number
[1:21:55] one out of the spiritual
[1:21:57] number two and the spiritual out of the
[1:22:00] spiritual number three three the
[1:22:03] spiritual out of the church rather
[1:22:05] then we get the three the three ages of
[1:22:08] eight
[1:22:09] so did jesus have the exodus here so now
[1:22:14] check mark did jesus have the power to
[1:22:18] create
[1:22:21] everybody remember when they brought him
[1:22:23] fish
[1:22:24] and loaf of bread when he cut the fish
[1:22:28] when he cut the broth everybody there
[1:22:31] let's check that one mark a prophet like
[1:22:34] unto who
[1:22:35] moses did jesus give them the manner
[1:22:41] in john chapter 6 jesus said
[1:22:45] your father did eat manna
[1:22:48] are you there manna was the bread that
[1:22:51] came down from
[1:22:53] heaven and jesus said but i am the bread
[1:22:56] that came down from
[1:22:58] he brought the true manner
[1:23:01] everybody there a prophet like unto who
[1:23:06] check mark the bread of life everybody
[1:23:09] there
[1:23:10] did jesus went into a mountain
[1:23:14] was the cloud coming down on jesus when
[1:23:16] he was in the mountain
[1:23:19] the cloud came and said this is my
[1:23:22] beloved son
[1:23:23] do what hear ye him everybody there
[1:23:28] check mark did jesus had the law
[1:23:32] and did jesus break the seal
[1:23:37] in the message the six seal brother what
[1:23:40] i'm saying now watch
[1:23:42] the first seal is revelation 6 1 and 2.
[1:23:46] everybody there who did we found these
[1:23:50] fellow walls an antichrist
[1:23:52] matthew 24 4 to 5.
[1:23:56] brother branham said when jesus was
[1:23:58] talking in matthew 24
[1:24:01] verse four and five he was prosperous he
[1:24:04] was speaking about the
[1:24:05] first seal you go read the six years
[1:24:11] now the second tier matthew 24 6
[1:24:15] are you there the third seal this is
[1:24:18] feminine matthew 24
[1:24:20] 7 and eight the fourth seal pestilence
[1:24:23] and death
[1:24:24] matthew 24 verse seven and eight
[1:24:28] the fifth seal matthew 24 verse nine and
[1:24:32] thirteen the sixth seal matthew 24
[1:24:35] verse 29 and 30.
[1:24:38] what about the seven seal now
[1:24:43] jesus omitted the teaching of the
[1:24:47] seventies it is not here watch he goes
[1:24:51] right on with the parable now
[1:24:52] after that john omitted the
[1:24:56] seventh hill so what jesus was doing on
[1:24:59] matthew 24
[1:25:00] is exactly what john was doing
[1:25:04] also in the book of what matthew
[1:25:08] what in the book of revelation are you
[1:25:10] there
[1:25:11] so in other words when jesus christ
[1:25:14] came jesus came and restored
[1:25:17] completely the tree of life and opened
[1:25:20] the door
[1:25:21] and bring the people to the baptism of
[1:25:24] the holy ghost
[1:25:25] but jesus when it comes to the title d
[1:25:28] jesus only gave the title the ensemble
[1:25:34] like john are you following me
[1:25:39] let's go to the book of revelation
[1:25:41] chapter one
[1:25:46] people say we must preach christ we must
[1:25:48] preach christ we must preach jesus
[1:25:52] right
[1:25:54] let's go to the revelation chapter one
[1:25:58] if you dare you can say amen revelation
[1:26:02] chapter one verse one
[1:26:05] the revelation of jehovah
[1:26:08] [Music]
[1:26:15] the revelation of jehovah
[1:26:18] the revelation of who so if you need to
[1:26:22] preach christ
[1:26:23] you must preach the book of revelation
[1:26:26] [Music]
[1:26:31] are you there so when jesus christ
[1:26:35] restored this he had a revelation that
[1:26:39] he sealed
[1:26:41] i'm going slowly that when then when he
[1:26:44] died
[1:26:45] he rose again he spoke to john
[1:26:49] and say there is something a revelation
[1:26:52] of myself
[1:26:53] that i have i'm gonna give it to you
[1:26:56] are you there and when he gave it to
[1:26:59] john he gave to john
[1:27:00] in symbols
[1:27:06] remember the point he restored this but
[1:27:09] never brought the book
[1:27:12] are you there okay the revelation of
[1:27:15] jesus christ
[1:27:16] which he gave to him to shout to his
[1:27:20] servant
[1:27:20] things which must shortly come to pass
[1:27:23] and he sent and signified by his
[1:27:26] to his servant john so this book must be
[1:27:30] explained by a
[1:27:32] manger
[1:27:36] it is a revelation but that revelation
[1:27:40] still when god gives it in symbols what
[1:27:46] does it mean
[1:27:47] we don't know everybody clear so
[1:27:50] john omitted their seven seals
[1:27:53] the seventh the last the seventh seal
[1:27:56] that is going to be a great thing
[1:27:58] it is not even written omitted the
[1:28:02] seventh seal
[1:28:02] both of them did are you there
[1:28:06] and the revelator when god just don't
[1:28:09] say
[1:28:10] there was just a silence in heaven jesus
[1:28:12] never say a word about it
[1:28:14] down here when we compare the scripture
[1:28:17] here with matthew
[1:28:19] 24 with the six everybody clear
[1:28:23] the seven seal was left out
[1:28:27] because you see christ said only god
[1:28:30] himself knows
[1:28:32] not even the angel no wonder it was not
[1:28:34] even written
[1:28:35] they hushed nothing take place then
[1:28:38] angel don't know it
[1:28:39] nobody knows when he is coming everybody
[1:28:42] there
[1:28:43] so he spoke about the sales in
[1:28:47] symbol form now did jesus
[1:28:50] lift up the serpent on the pole
[1:28:55] take john chapter 3
[1:29:00] a prophet like unto moses
[1:29:07] take john chapter 3 verse 14
[1:29:12] if you dare you can say amen
[1:29:15] everybody there page is still turning
[1:29:18] everybody there
[1:29:20] verse 14 and as moses
[1:29:23] everybody clear as moses
[1:29:26] lift up the serpent in the wilderness
[1:29:30] even so must the son of man be
[1:29:35] is that checked or crossed checked
[1:29:38] everybody clear when jesus died
[1:29:42] did he bring the resurrection
[1:29:45] checked everybody there a prophet like
[1:29:48] unto who
[1:29:50] any question let's look at paul
[1:29:55] because paul received also the baptism
[1:29:58] of the
[1:29:59] holy ghost we're trying to see are we
[1:30:03] going to be restored to what
[1:30:09] was paul a prophet we already prove it
[1:30:12] to you
[1:30:12] give you the bible scripture this is the
[1:30:15] faith
[1:30:17] this is the faith that john the baptist
[1:30:20] pointed that faith have the
[1:30:23] baptism of the holy ghost and all of
[1:30:26] this
[1:30:28] because they ask they say are you that
[1:30:30] prophet
[1:30:31] come and see the one who moves this and
[1:30:34] the other
[1:30:35] spoke are we there
[1:30:38] thank you all right let's go to paul
[1:30:42] was paul a prophet everybody clear with
[1:30:46] me
[1:30:46] did paul have three pools no
[1:30:53] okay did paul bring an exodus
[1:30:57] no you agree with me
[1:31:01] did paul created something in his
[1:31:03] ministry
[1:31:06] no everybody clear
[1:31:09] did bob did paul preach the word of god
[1:31:12] then brought the word
[1:31:13] [Music]
[1:31:15] check mark everybody clear did paul
[1:31:19] go to a mountain somewhere and meet a
[1:31:22] cloud
[1:31:24] no paul was a prophet
[1:31:30] moses a prophet jesus a prophet
[1:31:34] met the pillar of fire met the pillar of
[1:31:36] fire
[1:31:37] made the pillar of fire everybody clear
[1:31:40] but three pools no exodus
[1:31:44] no there is only three are you there
[1:31:48] [Music]
[1:31:50] created the the staff no
[1:31:54] going to a mountain no did paul
[1:31:57] went and break the seals
[1:32:01] let's put that to the idea he just spoke
[1:32:03] about it
[1:32:05] did paul bring the crucifixion paul
[1:32:08] spoke about the second crucifixion of
[1:32:10] christ
[1:32:11] are you there did paul bring the
[1:32:14] resurrection of the dead
[1:32:16] paul is still dead today any question so
[1:32:19] far
[1:32:22] was the fifth restore under paul
[1:32:26] why is those missing with paul
[1:32:30] why are they missing take first
[1:32:32] corinthians
[1:32:38] 13.
[1:32:42] if you dare you can say amen
[1:32:46] praise the lord
[1:32:50] a prophet like unto moses
[1:32:54] first corinthians 13. you there
[1:32:57] let's go to verse 9. for we know in
[1:33:05] can i repeat it again who's speaking
[1:33:09] for we know in fullness
[1:33:16] are we clear for we know in
[1:33:20] part and we prophesied in
[1:33:25] so everything that paul was doing
[1:33:29] that seems to be like the foundation was
[1:33:32] just
[1:33:34] huh
[1:33:37] everything that paul was doing was just
[1:33:40] uh
[1:33:46] we must be restored to the faith of the
[1:33:49] apostle
[1:33:51] it's gonna be first air part
[1:33:56] that but elijah must restore
[1:34:00] all things
[1:34:05] because we need to go back to eden
[1:34:12] i want to see that in the bible
[1:34:15] we prophesy in part
[1:34:18] but when that which is
[1:34:21] [Music]
[1:34:25] if you look at the seven church ages
[1:34:29] we usually draw them like this
[1:34:32] all right everybody remember that
[1:34:35] by the day we do we have more of this
[1:34:38] this is like
[1:34:39] completed thank you
[1:34:42] praise the lord if you notice
[1:34:46] we say this is paul this is
[1:34:50] martin this is columba this is errands
[1:34:52] if you remember the people in the
[1:34:54] message then we do this
[1:34:56] right which is the capstone right we go
[1:35:00] here all the way with seven church edges
[1:35:02] all right
[1:35:03] if you notice when you do this
[1:35:09] it gives you a perfect pyramid
[1:35:12] everybody see that right
[1:35:16] everybody there what makes this base
[1:35:20] a pyramid is the top part here
[1:35:26] if you take this top part out
[1:35:29] you have four sides everybody understand
[1:35:33] if you take this part you hook it there
[1:35:37] then this building becomes a pyramid
[1:35:41] but if you watch this building it is a
[1:35:44] pyramid of itself
[1:35:50] are you there this pyramid is already
[1:35:53] perfect
[1:35:55] he can live without you
[1:35:57] [Applause]
[1:35:58] are you there so you need that pyramid
[1:36:02] to come to you and make you perfect
[1:36:05] [Applause]
[1:36:07] are you there that's why they call the
[1:36:10] stature of
[1:36:11] a perfect man
[1:36:16] capsule when the caption comes he make
[1:36:19] you
[1:36:19] perfect
[1:36:23] are you there are we clear praise the
[1:36:27] lord so
[1:36:27] when that which is it's already perfect
[1:36:31] on itself
[1:36:33] it is called love it is the
[1:36:36] capstone it is already perfect
[1:36:41] but paul saying we are doing stuff in
[1:36:44] paul
[1:36:44] until the prophet comes when the perfect
[1:36:47] count then
[1:36:48] the entire building is ready for the
[1:36:50] rapture
[1:36:54] let's go back to the bible
[1:36:58] hallelujah verse 10
[1:37:01] but when that which is perfect is come
[1:37:05] that which is part is what in other
[1:37:08] words
[1:37:08] was this coming here we don't talk about
[1:37:11] this anymore
[1:37:12] the entire building is now talking about
[1:37:15] the
[1:37:15] pyramid because the entire ship now is
[1:37:18] what
[1:37:19] pyramid that's why paul said it is not
[1:37:22] me that live it is who it is not paul
[1:37:26] paul paul when cross enter it is now
[1:37:32] are we there let's look at that
[1:37:34] scripture a little bit brother branham
[1:37:35] help us
[1:37:37] first corinthians 13 says this
[1:37:40] everybody there when that which is
[1:37:42] perfect he's come
[1:37:44] that which is part shall be what
[1:37:47] done away with so all these little
[1:37:51] things
[1:37:52] they move off the pentecostal of jumping
[1:37:55] up and down
[1:37:56] like a king trying to talk in tongues
[1:37:59] because they speaking tongue speaking
[1:38:00] tongue
[1:38:00] and all these other when that which is
[1:38:03] perfect
[1:38:05] it is something that follows the
[1:38:07] movement of pentecost
[1:38:09] that follow simeon that follows
[1:38:12] zechariah
[1:38:13] that follow anna the prophet are you
[1:38:16] there
[1:38:17] that's why simeon said my eyes have seen
[1:38:20] this
[1:38:20] now i can't doubt because the shack once
[1:38:24] they see this created
[1:38:25] the shack have to pull up and die are
[1:38:28] you there
[1:38:29] praise the lord now he said and
[1:38:32] we heard today by god's help the
[1:38:37] prophet interpretation of
[1:38:41] the word
[1:38:50] let me jump down here that which is in
[1:38:54] part will be done away
[1:38:56] with wonder which is perfect is come
[1:38:59] or when that which is perfect is
[1:39:02] made no may not mean to be
[1:39:06] revealed are you there
[1:39:09] ah now i've got the question on that
[1:39:13] i hope i get it tonight if that won't
[1:39:17] happen when there
[1:39:19] are you there so brother branham connect
[1:39:22] this scripture with them
[1:39:28] let's go please explain first
[1:39:31] corinthians 13
[1:39:32] 8 12 now when the perfect word is
[1:39:35] restored to the church
[1:39:37] are these verses fulfilled clear
[1:39:41] now i think i just went through that
[1:39:44] didn't i and when that which is prophet
[1:39:47] has come
[1:39:48] now which is important shall be done
[1:39:50] away paul say
[1:39:52] listen bodybuilding do i speak with
[1:39:55] tongue of men and angel
[1:39:56] and do all these things but when that is
[1:39:59] perfect he's come
[1:40:01] we say love right now is there anything
[1:40:05] perfect about god
[1:40:08] no sir is god the prophet
[1:40:11] in the beginning was there you see that
[1:40:15] the congregation with black
[1:40:16] world and the world was with god
[1:40:19] and the word was and the world is still
[1:40:23] in other words that which is perfect is
[1:40:26] the
[1:40:27] word are we there
[1:40:30] now that's why paul prophesied on me
[1:40:35] so when you get him here he's missing
[1:40:40] so who's going to bring us something
[1:40:42] like unto
[1:40:43] moses
[1:40:47] did moses hear the people of fire
[1:40:59] [Applause]
[1:41:00] if you don't see it i'm presenting
[1:41:10] are we there you heard about it here you
[1:41:13] never seen it
[1:41:15] you heard about it here you never you
[1:41:18] heard about it
[1:41:38] [Applause]
[1:41:44] hallelujah
[1:41:58] how are we there
[1:42:02] [Applause]
[1:42:14] [Applause]
[1:42:24] [Applause]
[1:42:34] [Applause]
[1:42:38] [Music]
[1:42:55] 33
[1:43:01] praise the lord
[1:43:04] if you dare you can say amen
[1:43:12] hallelujah
[1:43:16] all right let's go by verse one
[1:43:19] and him and this is the blessing where
[1:43:22] with
[1:43:22] who moses the man of god bless
[1:43:26] israel they bless the children of israel
[1:43:29] before his
[1:43:30] death and he said the lord
[1:43:34] came from we know sana is more holy
[1:43:38] i already showed you that moses is
[1:43:41] telling us that
[1:43:43] when god came to mossannah i already
[1:43:46] gave you scripture if you
[1:43:48] go back to the series you'll find that
[1:43:50] horeb is
[1:43:51] sana he said when the lord came
[1:43:54] down came from musana and rose up from
[1:43:58] sail
[1:43:59] to them he shined forth from my parents
[1:44:03] and he came with ten thousand
[1:44:06] of cents from his
[1:44:11] so on sana brother robert already caught
[1:44:15] that
[1:44:15] on sana on mohawk
[1:44:19] in the right hand of god
[1:44:24] when god came down we usually say the
[1:44:27] angel came down
[1:44:28] and god spoke to moses that's
[1:44:30] superficial
[1:44:31] let's get deeper when you get deeper
[1:44:34] moses say
[1:44:35] when god met me on santa in the right
[1:44:39] hand of god a prophet like unto
[1:44:44] in the right hand of god went
[1:44:48] a fairy for them
[1:44:51] moses said in the right hand of god
[1:44:55] there was the book of law
[1:45:01] and the law was filed because it's
[1:45:04] judgment it still needs for a kingsman
[1:45:07] redeemer
[1:45:08] to pay the price so when god came down
[1:45:11] on monsanto
[1:45:13] moses unveiled to us that in the hand of
[1:45:17] god
[1:45:18] the right hand of god there was a book
[1:45:22] and that book was the law of moses
[1:45:25] the law of moses came with god
[1:45:28] down in the cloud with a book in the
[1:45:31] right hand
[1:45:37] thank you are you there
[1:45:40] brother stephen saying the bible says
[1:45:43] brothers
[1:45:46] that's the church the bible says i'm
[1:45:49] saying
[1:45:49] the bible says what i'm saying no people
[1:45:52] are dead
[1:45:54] are you there let's go to acts 7.
[1:46:03] after chapter 7 verse 38.
[1:46:12] usually we say bosses yeah the angel
[1:46:15] come the cloud came
[1:46:16] when the cloud came there was god
[1:46:20] in right hand with a book the book of
[1:46:22] the law
[1:46:24] are you there the law was only a
[1:46:28] substitution a school master
[1:46:31] until fed camp that log who
[1:46:35] was not the one in the original owner
[1:46:39] was just a school master
[1:46:42] but he came also in the right hand of
[1:46:45] god
[1:46:47] acts chapter 7 verse 38 if you dare you
[1:46:50] can say amen
[1:46:52] this is him how many person
[1:46:57] one person this is he that was in the
[1:47:00] church
[1:47:02] right in the wilderness with
[1:47:06] the angels
[1:47:10] oh so there was only one angel
[1:47:13] okay with their angel singular
[1:47:17] which spoke to him i thought he was god
[1:47:19] who was speaking to him
[1:47:25] god is also the angel of the lord right
[1:47:28] so here luke
[1:47:31] is explaining to us that on monsanto
[1:47:35] the angel of the lord
[1:47:39] was talking to moses
[1:47:43] and this angel moses told us that in his
[1:47:48] right hand
[1:47:49] there was a book yes
[1:47:55] okay 38 the angel which spoke to him
[1:47:59] in my sana we see that and with
[1:48:03] and with our father who received the
[1:48:05] lovely what
[1:48:07] oracle to give to us
[1:48:10] the lively oracle came the law
[1:48:13] in the right hand jump to verse 53.
[1:48:20] how many angels was there
[1:48:24] according to acts 7 38 he was only
[1:48:29] one injured so when god came on santa
[1:48:32] how many angels were there
[1:48:35] let's go to verse 53 you there
[1:48:40] who have received the law
[1:48:44] by the disposition of what
[1:48:47] i thought he was one
[1:48:53] so there were many angels
[1:48:57] i'm going slowly that came down
[1:49:00] on monsanto are you understanding
[1:49:04] but one of them was talking to
[1:49:09] moses and the one that was talking with
[1:49:12] moses
[1:49:12] has a right a book in his right
[1:49:18] watch
[1:49:23] and who receives the law by the
[1:49:25] disposition of what
[1:49:27] angel and have not kept it
[1:49:31] take galatians 3.
[1:49:36] a prophet like unto who
[1:49:45] galatians 3.
[1:49:49] if you dare you can say amen verse 19.
[1:49:53] you there
[1:49:56] okay paul said wherefore
[1:50:01] wherefore then serve the law what is the
[1:50:03] purpose of the law
[1:50:05] he was added because of what
[1:50:08] till their sin the seed of the woman
[1:50:11] should come to whom the promise was made
[1:50:15] and he was ordained by what confirmed
[1:50:19] again
[1:50:19] that he was not one angel it was many
[1:50:22] angels everybody seen that
[1:50:25] confirmed by angel in the hand of air
[1:50:28] media
[1:50:29] that means there was moses do you
[1:50:32] believe it or not
[1:50:34] somebody is quiet keep your finger here
[1:50:36] i don't want you to say brother steven
[1:50:38] say
[1:50:38] let's go to deuteronomy 5 5.
[1:50:43] i want you to say brother stephen or our
[1:50:45] pastor say
[1:50:47] if you look at a different translation
[1:50:49] he will tell you moses but i don't want
[1:50:51] you to say no but it's even saying the
[1:50:52] different translation ah
[1:50:55] detron on me five pounds are you there
[1:50:58] are you there if you're sleepy or what
[1:51:01] wake up
[1:51:03] detron on me far far are you there
[1:51:07] verse 4 the lord talked with you face to
[1:51:10] face
[1:51:11] in the mount of the midst of the fire
[1:51:14] verse five everybody there
[1:51:16] and i stood between the lord and you
[1:51:20] at that time are you there to show you
[1:51:23] the word of the lord
[1:51:25] for you were afraid by reason of the
[1:51:27] fire
[1:51:28] and went not up into the man who stood
[1:51:31] between the lord and the people that's
[1:51:34] why they say by the hand of a
[1:51:36] medieval that's why he said remember the
[1:51:39] law of moses in word
[1:51:41] you want a prophet to be between you and
[1:51:44] me that's why in the in the ministry of
[1:51:47] brother branham the angel of the lord
[1:51:49] comes
[1:51:49] it's why brother who look at him and say
[1:51:51] he's dead he's right here
[1:51:53] he's in between me and you you don't see
[1:51:55] him he said you feel that funny feeling
[1:51:57] it is him he talked to the prophet and
[1:52:00] the prophet
[1:52:01] talked back to you are we there but how
[1:52:03] many angels
[1:52:04] many angels let's go to hebrew chapter 2
[1:52:14] a prophet i like unto moses if you dare
[1:52:17] you can say amen
[1:52:20] the law came by angel but not
[1:52:23] all the angels one of them has the lord
[1:52:26] in his right hand on my sana so when the
[1:52:30] cloud
[1:52:31] came they were anger in the cloud one of
[1:52:34] that angel
[1:52:35] has a book in his right hand
[1:52:38] on the mountain hebrew two two are you
[1:52:42] there
[1:52:44] fo it's the word spoken by
[1:52:48] so those angels have word that they
[1:52:51] spoke
[1:52:53] each angel had a message
[1:52:59] not only was one angel who brought the
[1:53:01] book but
[1:53:02] in changing one has air seal
[1:53:10] and if the words broken by angels plural
[1:53:14] was steadfast and every transgression
[1:53:17] and these obedients receive a just
[1:53:19] reward what i'm pointing you here is
[1:53:21] what
[1:53:22] their angel when you go back to sunset
[1:53:25] mountain
[1:53:32] revelation 10.
[1:53:37] i don't want you to say brother stephen
[1:53:40] revelation 10 if you dare you can say
[1:53:43] amen
[1:53:47] it happened in moses bringing the law
[1:53:50] when jesus christ came jesus went to the
[1:53:53] mountain
[1:53:54] but no book is stopped today are you
[1:53:57] there
[1:53:57] because jesus only restored the baptism
[1:54:00] of the holy spirit
[1:54:01] he closed the seal are you there when
[1:54:04] paul came
[1:54:05] no mountain but the book of redemption
[1:54:08] must come down
[1:54:12] are you there but the same on you
[1:54:15] that happened in holland tell us that
[1:54:18] god
[1:54:19] came down without the angels
[1:54:22] and those angels also have messages
[1:54:25] and god also has a message with a roof
[1:54:28] in his right hand
[1:54:30] revelation 10 1 and i saw another
[1:54:33] mighty angel came down from heaven
[1:54:37] clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was
[1:54:40] upon his head
[1:54:41] and his face was out he wear the sun and
[1:54:44] his feet has pillar of fire
[1:54:46] and in his head was a leader
[1:54:50] so in revelation 10 um they are speaking
[1:54:53] about
[1:54:54] one angel that came down
[1:54:57] and that angel also in his hand their
[1:55:02] book
[1:55:14] how many
[1:55:18] take second thessalonians chapter one
[1:55:24] next second thessalonians chapter one
[1:55:29] praise the lord
[1:55:32] praise the lord are you there
[1:55:36] second thessalonians chapter one
[1:55:38] everybody there
[1:55:45] second thessalonians chapter one verse
[1:55:47] seven
[1:55:48] and to you who are troubled
[1:55:52] whether the cloud happen or not
[1:55:57] to you who are troubled trouble
[1:56:00] rest with us are you there
[1:56:05] when the lord jesus shall be revealed
[1:56:08] from heaven
[1:56:09] with his money
[1:56:15] it is a revelation in heaven
[1:56:18] in the sky the lord jesus christ is
[1:56:21] going to reveal himself
[1:56:22] but with angel marty
[1:56:26] angels that's why in the book of
[1:56:28] revelation they say
[1:56:30] another meaning they were other mighty
[1:56:33] angels
[1:56:34] but another that one when he came down
[1:56:38] a book in his hand on mohamed
[1:56:41] on monsanto and one angel came down
[1:56:44] with a book in his hand and there were
[1:56:46] also some angel
[1:56:48] that also gave messages to moses
[1:56:51] in sunset mountain one angel came a book
[1:56:54] in his hand
[1:56:55] but there were also other angels he took
[1:56:58] the prophet
[1:56:59] to give you the correct number that he
[1:57:02] was
[1:57:02] seven injured
[1:57:08] in a flaming fire just like inaudible
[1:57:14] are you there that's why brother brother
[1:57:16] called that clown
[1:57:17] a fire
[1:57:21] a prophet like unto who moses
[1:57:24] was brother branham did he have the
[1:57:26] pillar of fire
[1:57:28] the brother of adam was a prophet did he
[1:57:31] have to improve
[1:57:32] was that the next on this did he create
[1:57:35] him
[1:57:36] yes did he bring the world was in the
[1:57:39] mountain and then a cloud
[1:57:40] came and that cloud have a man with
[1:57:44] to have a ninja with a book in his right
[1:57:46] hand
[1:57:48] did brother branham reveal the word was
[1:57:52] the second crucifixion with brother
[1:57:54] branham
[1:57:58] in the message indictment and my
[1:58:01] indictment is against the churches of
[1:58:04] today
[1:58:06] i am not bringing the sinner into this
[1:58:09] he's a sinner to begin with
[1:58:11] i am speaking to the church the tape is
[1:58:15] the tips now i shall glad i shall try to
[1:58:18] get through
[1:58:18] as quick as i can i induct this
[1:58:22] generation
[1:58:23] for the second crucifixion of who
[1:58:28] are you there and then when
[1:58:31] brother branham spoke he said when the
[1:58:33] messiah
[1:58:34] when the marriage comes he dies all
[1:58:37] through
[1:58:38] the shout the voice of the archangel
[1:58:41] which is the voice of resurrection
[1:58:42] and also what are you there
[1:58:47] that's why brother branham said the
[1:58:49] cloud that was taken
[1:58:51] is a confirmation that the message is
[1:58:54] right
[1:58:54] and it's speaking about the resurrection
[1:58:59] a prophet like unto
[1:59:02] it happen in christ paul missed it
[1:59:05] because paul
[1:59:06] preached only in part it takes elijah
[1:59:10] in the end time to restore all
[1:59:14] things
[1:59:17] the problem is john 14.
[1:59:22] according to john 14
[1:59:25] whatever happened in the messiah
[1:59:29] will be multiplied
[1:59:36] the ministry of moses was portrayed
[1:59:40] perfectly in christ and the ministry of
[1:59:44] christ
[1:59:45] was portrayed into the end time ministry
[1:59:50] but john 14 says that whatever christ
[1:59:54] does you want to do it more
[2:00:02] that's why elisha asked for the
[2:00:06] double portion are you there
[2:00:09] what elijah deed when it comes under
[2:00:13] elijah
[2:00:14] it is double
[2:00:21] the works that i do
[2:00:24] shall you do us shall you also sam can
[2:00:28] but greater shall you do
[2:00:31] listen close get on your i pray that god
[2:00:35] will
[2:00:35] open your heart and your mind to
[2:00:38] understanding
[2:00:40] so that you shall understand without
[2:00:42] saying it too much here
[2:00:44] it's not for the public let's see some
[2:00:47] of the great work he done
[2:00:50] let's just stop for a couple of things
[2:00:53] let's think one
[2:00:54] time he said you feed them something to
[2:00:57] eat
[2:00:57] [Music]
[2:00:59] jesus said hey bring me the food
[2:01:02] he cut feed him that's what he did
[2:01:08] we have nothing say
[2:01:11] what have you got bring me what you got
[2:01:13] and they said we have five barley loaves
[2:01:16] and two fishes he said bring them to me
[2:01:19] he took the original five
[2:01:23] barley loaf and began to
[2:01:26] break the loaves and from the original
[2:01:29] he made
[2:01:30] bread in other words when jesus was
[2:01:34] creating he was using something
[2:01:37] that is already created and create
[2:01:40] something from it
[2:01:46] he got fish hand me the fish
[2:01:50] he was a fish to begin with he took off
[2:01:53] that fish another fish and another fish
[2:01:58] but in this last day
[2:02:01] according to john 14
[2:02:04] 12. in this last day he had
[2:02:08] nothing
[2:02:11] are you there in the time of jesus
[2:02:15] he was cutting and pulling carrying and
[2:02:18] pulling
[2:02:19] but this time the doctor d is back again
[2:02:24] and when they turtle d back again even
[2:02:27] though you don't have a substance
[2:02:34] you don't need the substance you just
[2:02:37] have to have a concept
[2:02:40] because that's how god was creating at
[2:02:43] the beginning
[2:02:44] god only have a thought when he spoke
[2:02:48] the thought materialized
[2:02:55] did not your lord say that you are
[2:02:58] god
[2:03:00] [Music]
[2:03:03] a dog child is a dog
[2:03:07] a child of a donkey is a donkey
[2:03:11] a child of a fish a leader of a fish
[2:03:14] it's a fish
[2:03:15] a child of god is god
[2:03:22] but in this last day he had nothing
[2:03:26] he just spoke with back in the beginning
[2:03:30] because that which is perfect is come in
[2:03:33] the beginning was there
[2:03:35] because the word was just concept speak
[2:03:38] concept speak concept speak you don't
[2:03:41] need
[2:03:42] material the material is in the concept
[2:03:49] say he'll be there and he was there
[2:03:51] without
[2:03:52] anything in it he never had a squirrel
[2:03:56] there was none there let there be
[2:03:59] we are back again in the beginning we
[2:04:02] are back again in
[2:04:03] eden we are back again with land before
[2:04:06] the fall
[2:04:08] you need the restoration of all
[2:04:11] things and there he was
[2:04:15] oh his word is infallible he has to be
[2:04:19] fulfilled what is your take home message
[2:04:22] we need to go back to the origin of
[2:04:24] faith
[2:04:26] that origin of faith first he comes
[2:04:29] in the ministry of john the baptist to
[2:04:32] pay the price
[2:04:33] by praying the pros god enter into the
[2:04:36] temple
[2:04:37] and john brought three elements
[2:04:39] repentance
[2:04:40] water baptism and the baptism of the
[2:04:42] holy ghost
[2:04:43] and then the lord entered into the
[2:04:45] temple and we found in the day of
[2:04:47] pentecost he
[2:04:48] entered into 120 temple that was the
[2:04:52] first part
[2:04:53] of the original faith but according to
[2:04:57] the prophet like unto moses
[2:05:00] when the lord come that origin of faith
[2:05:03] concerned a ministry
[2:05:06] in that ministry the one who comes must
[2:05:09] meet the pillar of fire
[2:05:11] the one who comes must be a prophet the
[2:05:14] one who comes must have three pools
[2:05:17] the one who comes must have an exodus
[2:05:19] the one who comes must have the power
[2:05:22] of the spoken word before the mountain
[2:05:26] that's why the square were created in
[2:05:30] 1959
[2:05:32] and the seals were in 1963.
[2:05:35] are you there the one who comes must
[2:05:38] bring the manner from heaven
[2:05:40] the one who comes must go to a mountain
[2:05:43] he must meet the angel and one of the
[2:05:46] angels must be the angel of the lord
[2:05:48] and must have the book open the one who
[2:05:51] come must
[2:05:52] reveal he must reveal the word on the
[2:05:56] rock
[2:05:57] that's why the the vision of genio
[2:06:00] jackson
[2:06:01] have a party that was written and
[2:06:03] another part that was not written
[2:06:05] the one who come must be crucified and
[2:06:08] he inducted the generation for the
[2:06:10] second crucifixion
[2:06:12] and he must bring the power of
[2:06:14] resurrection
[2:06:15] the key here is that of thee must come
[2:06:19] down the book
[2:06:23] that was sealed in revelation 5.
[2:06:26] in revelation 10 it is now open
[2:06:29] and we have that revealed word in books
[2:06:32] and
[2:06:33] tips that is your title d
[2:06:36] so the origin of faith restored the
[2:06:39] baptism of the holy spirit
[2:06:42] and must restore also there totally
[2:06:45] back to the rest of adam then we are
[2:06:48] ready for the
[2:06:49] rapture now this messenger of malachi 4
[2:06:54] revelation 7 it's gonna do
[2:06:59] are you there number one according to
[2:07:03] malachi 4
[2:07:04] he will turn the heart of the father to
[2:07:06] the the children to the father
[2:07:08] i'm sorry are you there which we start
[2:07:11] the
[2:07:12] baptism of the holy spirit of paul
[2:07:15] number two
[2:07:18] he will reveal we need the title
[2:07:22] the mysteries of the seven thunders
[2:07:26] in revelation 10 which are the
[2:07:29] revelation content in the seventh
[2:07:32] it will be this divine reveal mystery is
[2:07:36] true
[2:07:37] that literally in other words their
[2:07:40] seals
[2:07:40] will be the very thing
[2:07:45] that will turn the heart of the children
[2:07:47] to the pentecostal
[2:07:50] what we need is the restoration of the
[2:07:52] baptism of the holy ghost
[2:07:54] but today when you talk to the devil you
[2:07:57] must have the
[2:07:58] title of thee you just don't speak by
[2:08:01] word
[2:08:02] but you have also the title d that proof
[2:08:05] that you own the
[2:08:06] property god which we bless you
[2:08:10] [Applause]
[2:08:31] now when we say we store the back of the
[2:08:34] the
[2:08:34] the heart of the children back
[2:08:38] to the father you know because you're
[2:08:41] gonna say well we were already restored
[2:08:44] why do we need again the seals no you
[2:08:47] need the seals
[2:08:48] to complete redemption
[2:08:51] if you don't have the sales we're going
[2:08:53] to be like paul
[2:08:56] we're just going to preach in part
[2:08:59] that's why before the seals when brother
[2:09:02] branham went
[2:09:03] into the sixth dimension he said i
[2:09:06] preached like who
[2:09:08] in other words brother branham only was
[2:09:10] preaching him
[2:09:12] but when the seals broke it is more than
[2:09:16] paul
[2:09:18] are you there he could not die until he
[2:09:22] break the seal
[2:09:23] because the seal is what bring
[2:09:26] that which is perfect now we have
[2:09:30] paul plus we have the pyramid
[2:09:35] total and now we are ready
[2:09:38] for the millennium because in the
[2:09:40] millennium
[2:09:41] you must act like adam in the millennium
[2:09:45] it's christ and his blood that are
[2:09:47] living
[2:09:47] on honeymoon for a thousand years
[2:09:50] because adam did not fulfill one day
[2:09:52] which is a thousand years
[2:09:53] so you cannot be in the millennium
[2:09:56] hesitating to create
[2:09:58] you must be in the millennium
[2:10:00] comfortable
[2:10:01] you wake up in the morning you move that
[2:10:03] mountain you put it over there
[2:10:05] you move that tree you put it over there
[2:10:08] what adam stop
[2:10:09] we must fulfill it completely
[2:10:13] and we're not even waiting on the
[2:10:15] millennium we started

[2:11:37] you pray when faith drop
[2:11:41] you go there you say sir i need the race

[2:11:55] other one i will see later

[2:12:00] and it shall be
[2:12:02] we are tired of talking about the
[2:12:04] message it is time to leave the message
[2:12:12] let's pray heavenly father
[2:12:15] lord we thank you for your grace for
[2:12:18] your love
[2:12:19] and for your mercy father it is this
[2:12:22] grace
[2:12:23] that brought this stone from the hand of
[2:12:26] zero baby
[2:12:28] lord you knew that your children will be
[2:12:31] in the condition that we are today but
[2:12:34] father
[2:12:34] you spoke in your word that you shall
[2:12:36] not live as comfortless
[2:12:39] lord there is so much confusion so much
[2:12:42] so many things the devil is throwing to
[2:12:44] your children lord
[2:12:46] but the more he's doing it the more you
[2:12:48] are raising
[2:12:49] a clear standard father to remove all
[2:12:52] the smoke
[2:12:54] and to stabilize your children more and
[2:12:56] more into your word lord
[2:12:59] father this is not just a restoration of
[2:13:02] the person
[2:13:03] but you're restoring the person of the
[2:13:05] holy spirit in our heart
[2:13:07] plus you are giving us the title deal of
[2:13:10] redemption
[2:13:12] your prophet told us that when you went
[2:13:14] and you took it at the throne
[2:13:16] it belonged to you but you didn't want
[2:13:18] to keep it you send it down
[2:13:21] lord father to your children back again
[2:13:23] in the hand of adam reyes
[2:13:26] because the price has been paid the
[2:13:29] sacrifice was accepted in heaven
[2:13:31] and now the race of adam have a right to
[2:13:34] the title deal
[2:13:36] to claim that which belong to us father
[2:13:39] may we realize
[2:13:40] who we are may you quicken our heart
[2:13:44] to go higher and to be raptured in this
[2:13:47] revelation lord
[2:13:48] until our life will completely express
[2:13:51] nothing by the message of the hour lord
[2:13:54] help this church
[2:13:55] remember our brothers and sisters
[2:13:57] remember those that are struggling lord
[2:14:00] remember the young people that the devil
[2:14:02] is targeting
[2:14:03] trying to bring confusion in their head
[2:14:05] lord you spoke in your word that you are
[2:14:07] not the author of confusion lord
[2:14:10] father but you came lord so that your
[2:14:12] children will see clear
[2:14:14] and clear lord father because you say in
[2:14:17] the time of paul
[2:14:18] that he was looking through through the
[2:14:20] mirror but now we're not looking to a
[2:14:22] mirror
[2:14:23] we are looking face to face because when
[2:14:26] the cloud picture was turned to the
[2:14:28] right
[2:14:29] we saw your face and we want to look at
[2:14:31] that face
[2:14:32] and that face need to look to us lord
[2:14:35] and we will be
[2:14:36] transformed into the image of your son
[2:14:39] lord
[2:14:40] father we commit this day unto the hand
[2:14:42] may you help us lord
[2:14:44] and take the preeminence lord in our
[2:14:46] heart now life
[2:14:47] and lord father guide this church in
[2:14:49] everything as we commit lord this day
[2:14:52] and the beginning of the weekend to the
[2:14:54] end in the name of jesus christ
[2:14:57] amen god richly bless you church we love
[2:15:00] you
[2:15:01] brother abel would you come and take the
[2:15:06] service
[2:15:29] if you can back the slides up a little
[2:15:30] bit i wanted to i wanted to point some
[2:15:33] point out something here but um can we
[2:15:35] go back a little bit further by the day
[2:15:39] keep going
[2:15:45] people get confused about you know
[2:15:48] william branham because he made this
[2:15:49] mistake and he made that mistake but we
[2:15:51] know moses was told to speak to the rock
[2:15:53] and he smote the rock it's not about the
[2:15:55] mistakes of a man
[2:15:56] and furthermore a lot of the mistakes
[2:15:58] they said he made
[2:15:59] i don't necessarily believe he made
[2:16:02] those but i was just pointing out i
[2:16:03] wanted to point out can we go back a
[2:16:05] little bit further
[2:16:06] sorry
[2:16:11] right here all these things all these
[2:16:13] check marks
[2:16:15] we know that it wasn't this man
[2:16:18] that did these check marks god used this
[2:16:21] man
[2:16:21] to make these check marks god used this
[2:16:24] pillar of fire the holy spirit
[2:16:25] to make these check marks it's not about
[2:16:28] the man the man might have had mistakes
[2:16:30] and this man might have had mistakes
[2:16:31] because all men have mistakes we don't
[2:16:33] see
[2:16:33] no mistakes here no mistakes or no
[2:16:35] confusion and we don't see no mistakes
[2:16:37] here either don't get me wrong
[2:16:38] but i'm saying just his life in general
[2:16:40] wasn't about his life
[2:16:42] it was about what god used him for and
[2:16:44] we see he didn't bring glory
[2:16:46] to himself never once never once did he
[2:16:48] say i'm a prophet
[2:16:50] or or i spoke squirrels into existence
[2:16:52] never once did he bring glory to himself
[2:16:54] but he always said
[2:16:55] that you know i'm just i'm a hum i'm
[2:16:57] humble he always made himself humble
[2:16:58] and god used them to speak squirrels god
[2:17:00] used them to turn the picture aside and
[2:17:03] people will say oh
[2:17:04] the cloud was a rocket you can believe
[2:17:06] whatever you want
[2:17:08] but despite whatever it might have been
[2:17:10] i i don't believe it was a rocket but if
[2:17:12] it was a rocket
[2:17:13] do you see this picture do you see this
[2:17:16] picture of
[2:17:16] the hoffman's head of christ a perfect
[2:17:19] outline but oh a rocket went up and
[2:17:22] puffed that into the air
[2:17:23] and then furthermore the man who we
[2:17:25] believe to be the prophet and we know to
[2:17:26] be the prophet
[2:17:27] happened to have a revelation of turning
[2:17:29] it to the side to reveal
[2:17:31] that picture but it was a it was a
[2:17:33] rocket and oh he wasn't there and
[2:17:35] all this confusion you all can have it
[2:17:38] it's true to me i believe it
[2:17:39] with all of my heart because i don't see
[2:17:41] how by chance
[2:17:42] that could appear in the sky when it did
[2:17:45] the time it did
[2:17:46] and use this man to reveal what it was
[2:17:50] i can't believe that by chance that's
[2:17:51] not by chance to me and i believe that
[2:17:53] just as he was so many places by vision
[2:17:56] he could have been in that same place by
[2:17:57] vision we don't know we don't know we
[2:17:59] don't need to know
[2:18:00] we just believe because it's the word
[2:18:02] that's what i believe that's what i
[2:18:04] believe
[2:18:04] but anyway i apologize
[2:18:17] i'm one of them i'm one of them
[2:18:23] and i'm so glad that i can say
[2:18:26] i'm one of them i'm
