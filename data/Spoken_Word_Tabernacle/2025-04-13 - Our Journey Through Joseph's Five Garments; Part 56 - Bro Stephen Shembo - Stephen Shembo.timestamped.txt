[46:29] little bit as I'm going over my uh quick
[46:32] announcement as usually. So, you got
[46:35] used to this already. Amen. We greet you
[46:38] all in the precious name of our Lord and
[46:41] Savior Jesus Christ, both visible and
[46:44] invisible audience. Amen. Any family
[46:47] members here? God richly bless you.
[46:50] Brother
[46:53] Samma, God bless you. And sister Teresa,
[46:56] oh my God bless you. Welcome. Welcome
[46:59] again. And good to see you this morning.
[47:01] Let's give the Lord a
[47:07] big What a what a surprise. He made it
[47:11] without telling me. So it's a way to
[47:13] dodge preaching.
[47:16] Because if I knew before, I would just
[47:18] sit there and enjoy and I say, "You know
[47:20] what? You go ahead and take the ball
[47:22] because I believe in passing the ball
[47:25] and I have the quote for it." So, I will
[47:27] pass the ball and I sit there like we
[47:29] did last Sunday and then me also
[47:32] enjoying the sermon and it's so good on
[47:35] Sunday. Nobody told me about that.
[47:39] So wonderful. When I was sitting there,
[47:40] I say, "My
[47:42] God, wonderful." So here he come and
[47:45] he's sleep in. So I didn't even see you.
[47:47] God bless you. Welcome. Welcome.
[47:49] Welcome. Amen. Maybe at the end of the
[47:52] service, brother set, you can just
[47:54] remind me. He can come up and then
[47:56] dismiss the audience. Amen. We just want
[47:58] to appreciate and honor the gift of God.
[48:00] He is he's a minister still working for
[48:03] the kingdom of God. So we want to honor
[48:05] the gift of God. Amen. I believe we are
[48:08] up to date with the sermon and I believe
[48:10] we're reading our Bible twice a day. our
[48:12] cood our church ages 70 weeks of Daniel
[48:16] the seals adoption or somebody is
[48:20] listening or reading the message of the
[48:22] hour. Amen. So you have no excuse when
[48:26] you get in heaven somehow somebody is
[48:29] listening to the message of the hour.
[48:31] Amen. We appreciate everyone that was
[48:33] there in our appreciation dinner. Again,
[48:36] God bless you for your labor and for
[48:38] everything you're doing for the church.
[48:39] I extended my gratitude yesterday and
[48:42] I'm doing that again in front of all the
[48:44] church and our invisible audience on
[48:47] YouTube all over the world. We
[48:49] appreciate whatever you're doing for the
[48:51] kingdom. If everything is working, the
[48:53] sound is good, the atmosphere is
[48:55] prepared, all of that takes the
[48:57] congregation, the musician, the deacon,
[49:00] the trustees, the treasurer, everybody
[49:02] put together. So spoken word,
[49:04] congratulation. God bless you.
[49:13] Amen. Lord's willing, on April the 26,
[49:18] that will be our second quarterly
[49:20] question and answer. And then on May
[49:23] 10th, this is married couple meeting
[49:26] part six. The young man, I'm not sure. I
[49:29] send a message. I'm waiting to hear from
[49:30] the deacon to have a uh a clear date on
[49:34] it. The young sister was still waiting.
[49:36] Brother John Porter sent me a message.
[49:38] Everything went well with Sister Lily.
[49:41] All is well by God's grace.
[49:45] Amen. We thank God for everything. Amen.
[49:49] For those who need to catch up on the
[49:51] meeting, so please just be patient. We
[49:54] already got all the computer 24 in. They
[49:57] are loading up everything. So what I ask
[49:59] the technician is to make sure all the
[50:02] question and answer all the youngs men
[50:04] the young sisters meeting they can load
[50:07] them to every single computer and hand
[50:09] them up to the deacon. So if you miss
[50:11] something, you pick whichever deacon you
[50:13] want to go through or for some time if I
[50:17] have time then you can pick the pastor
[50:20] or you will spend time with sister
[50:22] Sharon going over stuff there because
[50:24] sister Sharon will be always available
[50:27] especially young sisters love that part
[50:29] over there. So sister Sharon also will
[50:31] be available. You can handle that when I
[50:33] will be upstairs doing my own thing or
[50:36] listening to brother brand or minding my
[50:38] own business. Are we together? Amen. So,
[50:43] just be patient. They're loading up
[50:45] everything so we make sure it's there.
[50:48] Unfortunately, a technical issue
[50:50] happened with part
[50:52] one of the married couple meeting and
[50:55] that one got in trouble. Everything else
[50:58] is there. That's why it's very important
[51:00] to be there because now whoever misses
[51:03] it, you miss part one. So, it's there. I
[51:07] mean something happened when they were
[51:08] transferring the data but it's there. So
[51:11] I know what it means. You got all the
[51:13] material whoever is coming up with
[51:16] married couple. If you all get married
[51:18] here and you stay here then I have to
[51:21] maybe make up on part one for you. Oh my
[51:25] god. But if you're traveling then it's a
[51:28] different issue. But if you're staying
[51:29] here and all of you are still here then
[51:31] I'll say you know what let's catch up on
[51:33] that part one and then try to load you.
[51:35] But I always try to recap a little bit
[51:38] and pick up somewhere. But the main
[51:40] thing I was looking for is the quotes
[51:43] that were given there. It's more the
[51:45] word, the quote and the scripture that
[51:47] brother Brandham gave. So you have them
[51:49] and then we move on. Amen. I believe
[51:52] brother Glenn and brother Kelly, brother
[51:54] Tony, everything is clear. I don't think
[51:56] I've forgotten something. Amen. So
[51:58] praise God. So let's go to our scripture
[52:01] this morning. and flight attendant, you
[52:03] prepare for
[52:06] takeoff. Amen.
[52:10] Praise
[52:11] God. You will need your Bible today. We
[52:15] need to go from verse to verse to verse
[52:18] verse. Amen.
[52:20] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is a
[52:23] different route and it's a route that
[52:25] the devil trouble God's children a lot.
[52:30] We'll try to dig into it slowly. I will
[52:33] try to go 35 miles an hour. Which one is
[52:36] school zone? 35. Yeah, 35. I will try to
[52:39] go 35 miles an hour. So, this soaking
[52:43] pretty good. Amen. We still with the
[52:46] blood upon the horn of the altar. You
[52:49] see how deep we are? You already forgot
[52:51] about that. We are We are way We are way
[52:53] way way deep. So once we finish with the
[52:56] blood upon the horn of the altar, then
[52:58] we come back up again and we pick up on
[53:01] the blood under the brazen altar. Then
[53:03] we move from that blood and try to come
[53:06] up from P4 house all the way and keep
[53:09] climbing up to the surface and move to
[53:11] the second
[53:14] garment. Brother Sam told me it will be
[53:17] interesting how you going to come out
[53:18] from
[53:20] there. Amen. So we try by the grace of
[53:24] God. So we still dealing with the same
[53:25] thing in prayer. Amen. We already
[53:29] explained three element here that we're
[53:31] dealing
[53:32] with. We're dealing with uh we already
[53:35] dealt with time. It's three element. One
[53:38] of them is time. You know that right?
[53:41] One of them is season. You know that
[53:43] what these two we already touched. The
[53:47] problem is on the purpose.
[53:50] This is where we have not touched it
[53:52] yet. Amen. So my subject this morning,
[53:57] amen, is our life journey through
[54:00] Joseph's five garment part 56.
[54:07] And my theme is purpose.
[54:13] I was trying to knock all three of them.
[54:15] The Holy Spirit would not let me in. So
[54:17] I have to go slowly, one by one.
[54:20] Amen. So stay tight. I'm going to go
[54:23] school zone because this is very
[54:26] important. Without understanding these
[54:28] three element, you will be jumping up
[54:32] like a Pentecostal or a Baptist. We got
[54:35] a lot of them in the message where we we
[54:38] don't know what we're doing. We are just
[54:40] moving by faith. And what we call faith
[54:43] is imaginary stuff. It's like we playing
[54:46] lottery with God. Amen. We're playing
[54:49] numbers. No hoping that one of this day
[54:52] one number will work then when we
[54:56] work but we don't know why it work and
[54:59] why did the other one didn't work that's
[55:02] the problem so let's pray heavenly
[55:04] father Lord we are approaching you
[55:06] humbly this morning father we thank you
[55:09] for your grace for your love your mercy
[55:12] and for everything you're doing for this
[55:13] church and the bride all over the world
[55:15] Lord Father in ourself we are
[55:18] insufficient and we are very limited
[55:20] And your prophet told us to master the
[55:23] human element, Lord. Father, may you
[55:25] come down again, Lord. Father, in the
[55:27] power of resurrection, may you speak to
[55:30] our soul and move me completely out of
[55:32] the way. May you be the one speaking,
[55:34] the one teaching, the one interpreting,
[55:36] and the one doing everything so that at
[55:39] the end of the day, may all the glory be
[55:41] returned back unto the Lord. Father, be
[55:44] the Alpha and the Omega. speak to our
[55:46] soul, both those that are visible and
[55:49] invisible, and those that will catch up
[55:51] later. Lord, we commit it all and seal
[55:53] the devil completely out of this place
[55:55] and every demon spirit in the name of
[55:58] Jesus Christ. Amen. Let's go to Psalm
[56:04] 82. I'm going to read couple verses
[56:07] there. Glory to God.
[56:10] I hope that you slept well because you
[56:13] always have a chance to sleep more than
[56:16] me.
[56:18] Amen.
[56:22] Psalm 82. If you dare, you can say amen.
[56:27] The Bible say, I have said, this is God
[56:31] talking
[56:32] that ye are God's.
[56:41] God didn't wait for the Holy Ghost
[56:47] to come in human being to call them God.
[56:53] Amen.
[56:55] I hope we are together because when
[56:57] Jesus came Jesus say I and my father we
[57:01] are one and the Jews pick up the stone.
[57:05] Amen. And they want to stone him. And
[57:07] Jesus say, "Wait a minute. You might be
[57:11] sitted." Jesus say, "Wait a minute. Why
[57:13] do you want to stone
[57:15] me?" They say, "Uh-uh. For good work.
[57:20] We stone you not." In other words, we
[57:22] love the miracle. We love the healing.
[57:24] We love all this good stuff. But we got
[57:28] one problem with you. The problem is
[57:31] you. Amen. Amen. The one we saw being
[57:35] birthed at Carolina Medical Center. In
[57:38] atrium over there in Noven. We were
[57:41] there. When your mother was pushing, we
[57:44] were there.
[57:48] You
[57:49] not even born in a hospital
[57:52] [Music]
[57:53] in a stable.
[57:56] Even animal were witness. Amen.
[58:01] Amen. Now you calling yourself God.
[58:09] [Laughter]
[58:11] Hallelujah. Amen.
[58:15] Jesus say well well.
[58:19] So why does your law
[58:25] call those to whom the word of God came?
[58:31] God called them gods.
[58:35] So if the word of God is coming to you,
[58:42] sir, is my Bible different than your
[58:45] Bible? If the word of God comes to you,
[58:49] You are who? God.
[58:52] Do you believe it? Amen.
[58:55] Because God doesn't send his word for
[58:58] nothing. No sir. When God sent his word,
[59:01] there is somebody there to receive the
[59:02] word. Amen. And only God receive the
[59:06] word. Amen.
[59:10] [Music]
[59:12] Are we together? Are we together? Are we
[59:15] together? Amen. So God when Jesus
[59:19] pointed to them, Jesus pointed to them
[59:22] back to the Old Testament when the Holy
[59:25] Spirit was not yet inside human being.
[59:29] Amen. Take your time. God called them
[59:32] gods without the Holy Ghost.
[59:36] Hallelujah.
[59:40] I thought Peter walk on the water
[59:42] without the Holy Ghost.
[59:45] [Music]
[59:46] He did what Jesus did. Jesus was God.
[59:50] And Peter also went and walked on the
[59:52] water. He did exactly what God did.
[59:56] Amen.
[59:57] But you have a problem believing Peter.
[1:00:00] Your problem is only Jesus Christ.
[1:00:04] Don't worry my friend. Let's continue. I
[1:00:06] have said you are who? Gods. And all of
[1:00:09] you are who? Children of the most high.
[1:00:12] It's clear a child of God is what? God.
[1:00:15] Is that a problem? No, sir.
[1:00:19] You're calling me I'm a child of God.
[1:00:21] Then when I tell you I'm God, you have a
[1:00:23] problem with me. So you don't even
[1:00:25] believe I'm a child of God.
[1:00:28] So why do you call me a child of God? A
[1:00:31] child of God is God. Wow. Amen. When you
[1:00:35] come out from something, you pick up the
[1:00:37] genetic material.
[1:00:40] Perfect. Amen. And we have the genetic
[1:00:43] material of God. It is called the
[1:00:46] predestinated seed.
[1:00:52] Are we together? Amen. Are we together?
[1:00:54] Amen. Verse seven. But
[1:00:58] ye shall die like who? Men. And fall
[1:01:01] like what? One of the princes. So it's
[1:01:04] our dual part.
[1:01:06] We are gods. I put this in little G.
[1:01:11] So he will help you up.
[1:01:14] Amen. And I'm going to put the other one
[1:01:17] man in a capital N.
[1:01:24] Because that one you can touch it. You
[1:01:26] can feel it. You can see it. Then you
[1:01:30] believe it. That's a problem right
[1:01:32] there. Amen. We clear on that one.
[1:01:34] Everybody clear? Amen. Let's go to
[1:01:36] Jeremiah 29. Amen. Amen.
[1:01:41] I'm going school zone because if I rush
[1:01:43] with this, you miss it and the devil
[1:01:44] will continue to trouble you.
[1:01:48] Our prayer got problem with time. Amen.
[1:01:51] It got problem with season.
[1:01:54] Now it got problem with purpose. If you
[1:01:58] don't understand these three thing, you
[1:02:00] will be frustrated all your Christian
[1:02:03] life like we always has been.
[1:02:07] Amen. Because when our faith goes
[1:02:09] sometime up, we say it's going to
[1:02:11] happen. It's going to happen. Then it
[1:02:12] doesn't happen.
[1:02:14] Then we lose faith because we didn't
[1:02:16] check the time element. Amen. Amen. We
[1:02:20] lose faith because we didn't check the
[1:02:22] season element.
[1:02:26] The season doesn't even depend on you.
[1:02:29] Amen.
[1:02:35] How many pray for flower to b in the
[1:02:38] spring?
[1:02:42] How many pray for that? Does the does
[1:02:45] nature follow you? So nature is
[1:02:48] following somebody. They don't care
[1:02:50] about you. Whenever it spring in the
[1:02:53] internal clock, nature begin to change
[1:02:57] your Bermuda grass. I mean grass that
[1:02:59] used to be funny, it begin to change
[1:03:01] again and become green. You didn't do
[1:03:04] anything.
[1:03:06] But when it's on the floor, you can put
[1:03:08] as much water as you want. Correct. It's
[1:03:11] not working. Amen. The problem is the
[1:03:13] season.
[1:03:15] When the season come, whether you spray
[1:03:17] water or not, everything life is coming
[1:03:20] back up. Everything is changing and
[1:03:23] turning green again.
[1:03:26] Praise God. In other words, when a
[1:03:27] season happen, it's painless.
[1:03:31] It is a faultless.
[1:03:34] What you were working too much on the
[1:03:36] fall in spring, you don't do anything.
[1:03:40] In the fall, you were watering,
[1:03:41] watering, watering. In the spring, you
[1:03:43] don't water. It still come up.
[1:03:45] [Music]
[1:03:50] Are we together? Are we together?
[1:03:54] We in the fog. Lord, Lord, I want this
[1:03:56] grass to turn green. Lord, Lord, I want
[1:03:59] this grass to turn green. You go
[1:04:00] outside. Oh, I feel the presence of the
[1:04:02] Lord. You go outside, the grass is still
[1:04:05] looking at you.
[1:04:07] I don't think God answer my prayer.
[1:04:12] I need to go to minister so and so they
[1:04:15] can lay me hand. Maybe I don't have the
[1:04:18] Holy Ghost. Wow. Wow. Then when you

[1:10:13] only to the just."
[1:10:15] He sent the rain to the just and the
[1:10:18] water, the unjust. So where do you think
[1:10:20] suffering will go? The just and the
[1:10:22] unjust. It goes ah we already prayed it.
[1:10:26] Come on. Suffering goes where? On the

[1:15:52] There should be a difference between the
[1:15:56] people who have received this word, this
[1:15:58] message and those that don't have the
[1:16:01] message.
[1:16:03] [Applause]
[1:16:05] The Bible even say when we cry, we don't
[1:16:08] cry like those that don't have hope.
[1:16:12] In other words, your cry must be
[1:16:14] different. Even your cry must be
[1:16:17] different. That's right. Amen. Because
[1:16:19] you're crying in hope.
[1:16:23] And actually what is crying is this man.
[1:16:26] [Applause]
[1:16:27] Amen.
[1:16:29] Are we together?
[1:16:31] That's true. First Corinthian chapter 2.

[1:16:41] type of thought? Peaceful.
[1:16:45] Good touch. Amen. Brother Stephen, but I
[1:16:48] got trouble.
[1:16:52] Verse uh nine, you there? Amen. But as
[1:16:56] it is written, what I hath not seen.
[1:16:59] This eye is a natural eye.

[1:17:11] Glory. Glory. The Bible say to him that
[1:17:13] have what?
[1:17:15] [Applause]
[1:17:16] Almost everybody got a ear. But there is
[1:17:18] a near
[1:17:20] that only a certain people have it.
[1:17:25] You might have a ear to hear natural
[1:17:28] stuff. But there is a near that hear
[1:17:31] spiritual stuff. And the Bible is saying
[1:17:34] here eyes has not seen your eyes has not
[1:17:37] seen it. Your eyes did not see this
[1:17:41] church.
[1:17:42] Yes sir. Hallelujah. Six years ago, your
[1:17:46] eye did not see this church.
[1:17:52] But this church was already here.

[1:19:34] to your heart. That's why brother
[1:19:36] Brandham say whatever the Lord
[1:19:40] lead your soul
[1:19:42] your heart to believe. In other words,
[1:19:45] God is delivering the package. That's

[1:20:04] things that belong to you that you're
[1:20:07] not aware of.
[1:20:10] You are completely ignorant
[1:20:13] of that.
[1:20:15] That's why God say, "I know
[1:20:20] I know what I already have prepared for
[1:20:22] you. You are just ignorant until I tell
[1:20:25] you that since your childhood
[1:20:30] Amen. I have a bank account for you that

[1:20:46] say, "Daddy, I will go to college. How
[1:20:47] am I going to pay for my college?" I
[1:20:49] say, "Don't worry. I know."
[1:20:53] But daddy, I'm applying for scholarship.
[1:20:55] I know.
[1:20:57] I'm saying I know based on what I
[1:21:00] already prepared.
[1:21:02] [Applause]

[1:21:08] solution to handle that.

[1:21:43] ignorant? The Holy Spirit. Who tell you
[1:21:45] things you don't know? The spirit. Yes,
[1:21:48] sir.

[1:21:55] withdraw.
[1:21:58] Amen. Hallelujah. Your dividend from
[1:22:00] this package here.
[1:22:03] God uses the Holy Spirit.
[1:22:06] Amen.
[1:22:09] Is that complicated? I know when I say
[1:22:11] the Holy Spirit, some of you are waiting
[1:22:14] my child. My child,
[1:22:17] I have purpose in your life to give you
[1:22:20] this.

[1:22:33] Amen. The woman with a blood issue spoke
[1:22:36] how?
[1:22:39] How? In her heart.
[1:22:41] So who was talking?
[1:22:44] who was talking herself.
[1:22:47] And why did she came up with that idea?
[1:22:52] She didn't say, "I'm going to go there
[1:22:54] so he can pray for me. I'm going to go
[1:22:56] there so he can lay hand on me." For
[1:22:58] some reason, she say, "You know what? If
[1:23:01] I can just touch the hem of his
[1:23:06] and when she did, it
[1:23:07] worked." Right. Right.
[1:23:10] [Applause]
[1:23:12] It looked like he was heard talking.
[1:23:15] [Music]
[1:23:17] And Jesus called that faith
[1:23:20] revelation.

[1:23:57] right. That's right. That's exactly
[1:23:59] right. That's exactly. And say, who am I
[1:24:01] dealing with? Brother Tony Thompson. And

[1:24:31] who can go there together is the Holy
[1:24:34] Ghost. Amen.

[1:24:42] dealing with?" Elijah. And the Holy
[1:24:44] Ghost say, "Wait a minute." And he goes

[1:25:14] deep.

[1:25:26] bank account. You know that. Do you know
[1:25:29] my pin number? Do you know how much
[1:25:31] money I know? Those are the deep stuff.

[1:26:00] the seven seal open God kept the seven
[1:26:03] seal quiet
[1:26:05] [Applause]
[1:26:11] brother say there's the reason why the

[1:26:18] will catch one thing he will make a lot
[1:26:21] of damage.
[1:26:25] So the things deep of God are only

[1:27:04] you to get the deep things,
[1:27:06] the inside of the church, yes, sir, you
[1:27:09] need to have access. And the deep things
[1:27:12] belong to God. And the spirit of the
[1:27:16] Lord goes to search the deep things of
[1:27:18] you. Things that surprises the devil.
[1:27:22] Yes, sir.
[1:27:24] [Applause]
[1:27:27] Yes sir.
[1:27:28] [Applause]
[1:27:29] In other words, it's something that when
[1:27:31] it happen in your life, even Satan say
[1:27:37] this one, I never thought this one can
[1:27:40] end up like this. It was hidden
[1:27:44] because if the devil knew that he would
[1:27:47] have killed you but God hid it and you
[1:27:52] are dancing in the night crap and the
[1:27:54] devil think you are nobody.
[1:27:57] But if the devil knew you going to be a
[1:27:59] preacher,
[1:28:01] that will bring souls to Christ.
[1:28:04] [Applause]
[1:28:05] Those things are hidden in God.
[1:28:07] [Applause]
[1:28:11] Are we together? Are we together? There
[1:28:14] are some of us our family member thought
[1:28:16] you were stupid.
[1:28:19] Thank you.
[1:28:22] Our family member thought you are
[1:28:24] intelligent
[1:28:26] because you flank out of school. They
[1:28:28] say this one won't go farther until you
[1:28:31] reach God and God begin to open the deep
[1:28:34] princes. Then you are the better of your
[1:28:38] entire family. Now your family depend on
[1:28:41] you.
[1:28:45] [Applause]
[1:28:48] Are we together? Are we together? Are we
[1:28:52] together?
[1:28:54] Are we together? Oh, Jesus. Amen. Have
[1:28:57] you seen a woman that people say she's
[1:28:59] ugly?
[1:29:02] And the people say, "Ah." And we use a
[1:29:04] fancy word. She's not too attractive.
[1:29:09] It's a fancy way to say ugly. Ugly to
[1:29:12] you. Ugly to you.
[1:29:15] And usually they get the husband that
[1:29:17] are handsome.
[1:29:21] And when the people look they say, "Ah,
[1:29:24] this one really with this boat." What
[1:29:26] happened to this B? God surprises the
[1:29:30] devil.
[1:29:34] [Applause]
[1:29:38] Can I continue? Can I continue?
[1:29:42] Where are we at? I told you. Yes, sir.
[1:29:45] Let's move on. Where are we at? Verse
[1:29:48] 11. Verse 11. Mhm. Oh, okay. For what
[1:29:52] man? What knoweth the things of a man?
[1:29:55] Uhhuh. Save what? The spirit of man
[1:29:57] which is in him. In other words, the
[1:29:59] only way you can know what is in a man,
[1:30:01] you must make a contact with the spirit
[1:30:03] of a man. That's why brother Brown, I'm
[1:30:05] under discernment.
[1:30:07] [Applause]
[1:30:10] Have to contact your spirit.
[1:30:14] Because the Bible say that the spirit is
[1:30:16] the light of the body.
[1:30:19] So once your spirit is contacted, they
[1:30:21] use that as a flashlight
[1:30:24] to begin to pull the deep things that no
[1:30:27] one knows. That brother Brham doesn't
[1:30:30] know. But brother Brham can even tell
[1:30:32] you the doctor and the appointment and
[1:30:35] where you were.
[1:30:37] He can go back toward the past and even
[1:30:40] go to the future. Amen. Because he made
[1:30:43] contact with your spirit.
[1:30:46] What about if you make contact to the
[1:30:48] spirit of God?
[1:30:50] Then what do you know?
[1:30:53] Then what do you know? The deep things
[1:30:56] of God. Are we together? Amen. That's
[1:30:59] why we can never overemphasize to the
[1:31:01] need of the Holy Ghost. That's right.
[1:31:04] That's right, brother. That's right,
[1:31:06] brother. For the believer, the Holy
[1:31:08] Ghost is everything.
[1:31:09] Everything is everything. Yes, sir. Are
[1:31:12] we together? Are we together? Oh, glory
[1:31:16] to God. Where are we at, my friend?
[1:31:18] Verse 11. Uh-huh. And even so, the
[1:31:21] things of who? God. Knows who? No man.
[1:31:28] How many men are here?
[1:31:31] That that word men's means human. How
[1:31:34] many human beings are here? We don't
[1:31:36] know the things of God.
[1:31:39] Come on. But the water spirit of God. So
[1:31:42] to get access to the things of God, you
[1:31:44] need to be connected to who? The spirit
[1:31:46] of God. Are we together? Amen. Jump to
[1:31:49] verse 12. Now we have received what? Not
[1:31:53] the spirit of the world. Uhhuh. Because
[1:31:55] you would know what mean stuff.
[1:31:59] But the spirit of what? Which is of God.
[1:32:01] Uhhuh. That we might know the things
[1:32:03] that are freely given to us. We might
[1:32:05] know. It's the purpose,
[1:32:09] the reason why the spirit of God is
[1:32:12] coming.
[1:32:14] The reason why the Holy Ghost is coming
[1:32:16] to you is because God have thoughts.
[1:32:21] God has things prepared for you. God has
[1:32:25] deep things prepared for you that you
[1:32:27] are completely ignorant of. And God is
[1:32:31] sending the Holy Spirit so that the Holy
[1:32:34] Spirit may make you know or reveal to
[1:32:38] you the things that were given to you
[1:32:41] how freely. How? Freely. Did you pay for
[1:32:45] it? It is given to you how? Freely.
[1:32:49] That's why they are painless.
[1:32:52] [Applause]
[1:32:56] Amen. The things that you have given to
[1:32:58] you. out freely. So these thoughts are
[1:33:01] free.
[1:33:03] Glory be to God. Freebies.
[1:33:06] God in his sovereign will. Uhhuh. He
[1:33:10] say, "Brother Lammo, one, two, three,
[1:33:15] four." And God put the package and seal
[1:33:17] it. Amen.
[1:33:21] When we say, "Brother Lamont,
[1:33:23] this I'm unworthy."
[1:33:26] [Applause]
[1:33:28] insulting the one who thought that you
[1:33:30] were worthy.
[1:33:34] He say you are worthy. John, go get the
[1:33:37] book. Am I worthy?
[1:33:40] God is telling me to get the book. I
[1:33:42] don't think twice
[1:33:44] because he judged me worthy. That book
[1:33:47] in heaven, no one was worthy. But when
[1:33:50] the book come on the earth, it's no
[1:33:53] longer over there. It is my property
[1:33:55] here now. I am ready. I won't even f I'm
[1:34:00] going straight ahead and say, "Hey, give
[1:34:02] it to me."
[1:34:06] You don't have to pay anything. It's
[1:34:07] freely. That's why the angel did this.
[1:34:11] [Music]
[1:34:13] But do you know, John,
[1:34:15] give me the book.
[1:34:19] After they told you go get it, you still
[1:34:22] come. You say, "Give it to me."
[1:34:25] And the angel repeated again. He say,
[1:34:27] "You take it."
[1:34:29] [Applause]
[1:34:32] Amen. And do with it what?
[1:34:38] If you eat something
[1:34:40] and you digested it become bitter and
[1:34:43] everything, will you ever discover that
[1:34:45] thing again? No. So we you you see in uh
[1:34:48] in Eden, Adam was having the book like
[1:34:51] this.
[1:34:53] I'm just giving an illustration. Adam
[1:34:55] was having a book like this.
[1:34:59] See, stop. Stop.
[1:35:03] Okay. Lion come here. He comes.
[1:35:06] When the trouble came.
[1:35:09] Amen. God came and say
[1:35:14] that's right. Amen.
[1:35:16] Are we together? But after the blood of
[1:35:19] Calvary,
[1:35:25] the book came again in the hand.
[1:35:29] God said, "Don't make the mistake of
[1:35:31] Adam. Adam didn't eat of the tree of
[1:35:34] life."
[1:35:37] Hallelujah. Today, when you see the tree
[1:35:40] of life, don't waste time. Take the tree
[1:35:43] of life first
[1:35:46] so that you can eat it and remain
[1:35:48] eternal. No matter how you struggle, you
[1:35:52] are already eternal.
[1:35:54] No matter what can happen, the book is
[1:35:57] in you. It will never go back to God.
[1:36:02] [Music]
[1:36:03] [Applause]
[1:36:06] Glory. Are we to God? Are we together?
[1:36:10] Are we together? Don't keep the message
[1:36:12] in your hand. No, sir. Put the message
[1:36:14] in you.
[1:36:16] [Applause]
[1:36:18] Are we together? Where are we at, my
[1:36:21] friend? Verse 13. Verse 13 says what?
[1:36:23] Which things also we speak. No, no, no,
[1:36:26] no. Let's keep verse 13. Drop to verse
[1:36:28] uh 16. Uhhuh. I'm still reading this
[1:36:31] scripture. Amen.
[1:36:33] Let's go in verse 16. For who hath known
[1:36:36] the mind of the Lord to do what? that he
[1:36:39] may instruct him. Stop.
[1:36:43] Who have known it? In other words, Job,
[1:36:46] where were you?
[1:36:48] Where were you when I was planning all
[1:36:51] of this? Where were you? But Paul didn't
[1:36:54] stop there. Continue, my friend. He says
[1:36:56] what? But we have the mind of Christ.
[1:36:58] But we have what? The mind of Christ.
[1:37:01] The mind of Christ is the Holy Ghost.
[1:37:04] [Applause]
[1:37:07] I have I have quote after quote. That's
[1:37:09] why brother Brandham said the mind of
[1:37:10] Christ is brought to you by the Holy
[1:37:13] Ghost because it's the Holy Ghost that
[1:37:16] searches the things of God and bring
[1:37:19] them to you. And Paul is saying like hey
[1:37:23] over there nobody was there to tell God
[1:37:25] anything but now
[1:37:28] we have that mind.
[1:37:31] Amen. Amen.
[1:37:33] Are we together? Amen. In other words,
[1:37:35] we are no longer ignorant.
[1:37:38] Amen. We clear.
[1:37:42] What are you trying to say today,
[1:37:43] pastor?
[1:37:46] As we climbing,
[1:37:48] brother Brham says here in the God who's
[1:37:51] rich in mercy, he says, I ask him for
[1:37:54] what? Something sometime. Please keep
[1:37:56] your seat belt. Okay. 35 miles an hour.
[1:37:59] And then what? He shakes his head. No.
[1:38:03] When did you see God shaking his head?
[1:38:09] You have to see him physically.
[1:38:14] So shaking his head means what?
[1:38:17] He might be quiet.
[1:38:20] He might not answer you. It's a way to
[1:38:24] say
[1:38:26] continue. He shake his head and say
[1:38:28] what? No.
[1:38:30] Brother Brandham say I just rejoice so
[1:38:33] much about it
[1:38:35] as I can if he says what yes
[1:38:39] in other words God answer whether with a
[1:38:43] no or a what? Yes. The no is what we
[1:38:46] don't like. Amen. Let's be honest. We
[1:38:50] don't like the no. We want when we go we
[1:38:53] push the button we get it. We push the
[1:38:55] button we get it. That's right. Brother
[1:38:57] Brandham said when he says no,
[1:39:00] I will rejoice the same as water. Yes.
[1:39:03] Follow me my friend because the reason
[1:39:07] we always ought to ask what thy will be
[1:39:11] done.
[1:39:12] Amen. I will get to this maybe next
[1:39:14] Sunday or the Sunday that will follow.
[1:39:17] He's knows
[1:39:20] just is just if that is what his will.
[1:39:26] It is. So the knows of God goes with his
[1:39:31] will.
[1:39:32] [Applause]
[1:39:34] Are we together? The knows of God.
[1:39:38] The knows of God are connected
[1:39:42] to his will.
[1:39:44] Are we together? Amen. And then he says
[1:39:49] that is a whole lot better than his
[1:39:53] yeses. Amen. In other word,
[1:39:57] we together. Amen. The knows of God
[1:40:02] that are in line with his will.
[1:40:08] Are better
[1:40:11] than the yeses of God. Yes, sir. Yes,
[1:40:14] sir. Yes, sir. Break it down.
[1:40:17] I don't know if you getting me. Yes,
[1:40:19] sir.
[1:40:20] If the not of God is in line with the
[1:40:24] will of God, come on. For your life,
[1:40:27] brother. Come on, brother. Amen. Thank
[1:40:30] you, Lord. Are we together? Amen. It is
[1:40:33] better than what? His yeses. Because
[1:40:36] these yeses here are the yeses that are
[1:40:40] contrary. That's right. Yes, sir. To his
[1:40:44] will.
[1:40:45] [Applause]
[1:40:47] I don't know if we together. I don't
[1:40:50] know if we together. When a yes is
[1:40:53] contrary to his will, he put us in a
[1:40:56] permissive will.
[1:41:00] [Applause]
[1:41:02] I told you I'm going slowly with this.
[1:41:05] Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:41:08] Amen. Amen. You say what? I rather I'm
[1:41:12] suffering too much. Please, I know it's
[1:41:14] your permissive. Will you just give it
[1:41:15] to me?
[1:41:20] Can I continue? Can I continue? What
[1:41:25] God, what makes God answer no
[1:41:31] is because what you asking
[1:41:38] is not in his thoughts.
[1:41:43] [Music]
[1:41:43] [Applause]
[1:41:45] Are we together? It is not prepared for
[1:41:48] you.
[1:41:50] It is not among the deep things of you.
[1:41:57] Lord, there is an offer of job in
[1:42:00] California.
[1:42:03] I'm going to make a lot of money there.
[1:42:06] It's
[1:42:08] $180,000 a year.
[1:42:11] [Applause]
[1:42:12] [Music]
[1:42:13] The spirit of the Lord goes to your
[1:42:17] foul s
[1:42:23] and the spirit of the Lord open your f
[1:42:26] and he said he doesn't see California.
[1:42:33] [Applause]
[1:42:37] Do you follow me? Yes sir. What the
[1:42:39] spirit of the Lord remembered about
[1:42:41] California is either it will go down in
[1:42:44] the ocean.
[1:42:48] And California is a preacher graveyard
[1:42:54] and the spirit of the Lord come and say
[1:42:56] no.
[1:42:58] No. Because it's contrary to his plan
[1:43:01] for you.
[1:43:04] Because his plan is a plan of peace.
[1:43:08] It is not an evil. You're trying to go a
[1:43:12] different route that will cause you
[1:43:14] problem. His nose are better.
[1:43:18] [Applause]
[1:43:25] Amen. I thought this relationship will
[1:43:27] work.
[1:43:29] [Music]
[1:43:31] I thought that relationship will work. I
[1:43:34] love him. He's a sweet. He looks good.
[1:43:37] a wolf in sheep clothing.
[1:43:42] Very sweet and humble.
[1:43:44] [Applause]
[1:43:47] God said, "What is your name?" And the
[1:43:50] Holy Spirit open your father. He said
[1:43:53] the name of your husband is this.
[1:43:57] That one is not your husband. God come
[1:44:00] and say no.
[1:44:04] I have a curse in my family. You not
[1:44:07] under curse. No sir. No sir. There is no
[1:44:11] curse in your family.
[1:44:15] Glory to God.
[1:44:17] [Applause]
[1:44:20] I know some are PhD in demonology.
[1:44:23] They see the devil everywhere but they
[1:44:25] don't see God everywhere. If something
[1:44:28] happened, I believe it's a curse in my
[1:44:30] family. My mother suffered that. My
[1:44:32] uncle suffered that. You a different
[1:44:34] breed. You are God.
[1:44:39] [Applause]
[1:44:44] Adam died. Sat die. Abel died. Enoch
[1:44:48] came up under the same limit. But Enoch
[1:44:51] never die.
[1:44:52] Who told you you're going to go through
[1:44:54] the same thing?
[1:44:56] [Music]
[1:44:59] Can I continue? Can we continue?
[1:45:02] Hallelujah. Brother Brham say that is a
[1:45:05] whole lot what better than his yeses. If
[1:45:08] it is what his will to do it that is
[1:45:11] when we really do what love.
[1:45:16] [Applause]
[1:45:17] [Music]
[1:45:18] Ecclesiastes 3:1
[1:45:21] do everything there is what a season
[1:45:25] and a purpose and a time to what? Every
[1:45:29] purpose under the heaven. Under the
[1:45:31] heaven. Where? under heaven. Who's in
[1:45:33] heaven?
[1:45:35] Everybody is under heaven. So under
[1:45:38] heaven there are laws. Amen. There is a
[1:45:42] law of time. There is a law of season
[1:45:45] and there is a law that drive the
[1:45:46] purpose. So remember that.
[1:45:50] Are we together? Are we clear together?
[1:45:53] When it comes to time with God, brother
[1:45:56] Brham says this. He says, "As I told you
[1:46:00] before,
[1:46:02] well, what many times, time and sight is
[1:46:07] what? The worst enemies that God has
[1:46:14] God has a problem with sight and time.
[1:46:18] God has a problem with that. Sight and
[1:46:21] time, time and sight. You look at
[1:46:24] water." Neither one of them declares
[1:46:27] anything about God
[1:46:30] because God is in eternity. You
[1:46:32] understand this? Now sir when he looked
[1:46:36] at Thomas he said you saw
[1:46:39] that's the reason why you believe but
[1:46:41] blessed are those
[1:46:46] because whatever is existing today was
[1:46:49] not visible. No sir. The Bible say the
[1:46:52] visible came from the invisible. So God
[1:46:55] is more in the invisible than the
[1:46:58] visible. God is in the back part. There
[1:47:03] is there is there is there is
[1:47:09] you know the teller that you go at the
[1:47:11] bank and you talk to the teller and they
[1:47:14] take your money they put they withdraw
[1:47:15] the money they give it to you. Do you
[1:47:17] know the manager of the bank? Those are
[1:47:19] not really the bank.
[1:47:22] Those are the visible bank. The true
[1:47:25] bank, the one that kick you with
[1:47:28] overdraft. It's not those people. They
[1:47:31] are on the back. You don't see them. You
[1:47:33] don't go there. They don't give you
[1:47:35] access to that. They only give you
[1:47:37] access to the branches. Those are the
[1:47:40] one that work the true deal.
[1:47:44] Amen.
[1:47:46] The one who's talking to you about the
[1:47:48] loan is not the one deciding the
[1:47:51] underrered that you don't see. This is
[1:47:54] the one that's saying yes or no to the
[1:47:56] loan.
[1:48:00] Are we together? Are we together? We
[1:48:03] fall in love with the banker because
[1:48:05] he's sweet.
[1:48:10] But when you are sleeping at night,
[1:48:12] that's when banker are changing stuff.
[1:48:15] Yes sir. When you wake up in the
[1:48:17] morning, your deposit is showing up.
[1:48:21] Yes sir. Can I continue? Yes sir.
[1:48:23] Brother say you want it done. How?
[1:48:26] Spontaneously. When God does what? Takes
[1:48:29] his time about things.
[1:48:33] God take his time.
[1:48:35] In other words, God is not uh somebody
[1:48:38] that you can uh I mean uh uh trigger or
[1:48:42] or or or frustrate quickly and he say
[1:48:46] God doesn't do that. He take his time

[1:51:48] 1:1 that in the beginning was what? The
[1:51:53] word. And the word was with who? God.
[1:51:58] So God was before the word.
[1:52:02] Exactly. I told you follow me. In the
[1:52:05] beginning was what? The word. And the
[1:52:07] word was with what? God. So here is the
[1:52:11] beginning. Yes, sir.
[1:52:16] Before the beginning, there was who?
[1:52:18] God.
[1:52:23] Are we together? In the beginning was
[1:52:26] what? The word. The word was with who?
[1:52:29] God. And the word was who? God.
[1:52:35] Are we together? Amen. And the word was
[1:52:38] made how? Flesh.
[1:52:42] The word become human. Amen.
[1:52:46] And when the word was made flesh, he was
[1:52:49] called Emmanuel.
[1:52:53] [Applause]
[1:52:56] Which means what?
[1:53:00] In the beginning was what? The word. And
[1:53:03] the word was with who? God. And the word
[1:53:06] was what? God. And when the word was
[1:53:09] made flesh, he was called what? God.
[1:53:14] Emmanuel, which means what? God with us.
[1:53:16] So the word made flesh was God. Mhm. And
[1:53:20] the word was God. Amen. And God was God.
[1:53:26] [Applause]
[1:53:31] If I lost you, raise your hand. Are we
[1:53:34] together? In other word, the nature of
[1:53:37] this being
[1:53:40] never change.

[1:53:46] the various form
[1:53:49] this being is taking he's just changing
[1:53:52] form
[1:53:54] changing mask immort.
[1:53:57] But if you look on the inside it's the
[1:53:59] same person.
[1:54:03] Are we together?
[1:54:05] This word here is called
[1:54:09] theophani. Amen. It is a form of God.
[1:54:14] Are we together? It is also called the
[1:54:17] pillar of fire.
[1:54:21] Are we together? This one, the Hebrew
[1:54:24] call him Elohim.
[1:54:29] Are we together?
[1:54:31] But this word, the Bible say everything
[1:54:35] that existed. That's right. That's
[1:54:37] right, brother. Amen. Do you follow me?
[1:54:39] Amen.
[1:54:40] One, two, three. The Bible say
[1:54:45] everything that was that existed never
[1:54:49] was created by one.
[1:54:53] It's if if you don't say amen, we open
[1:54:56] the Bible. Do you know where it is? Do
[1:55:00] you know where it is?
[1:55:02] Open John one.
[1:55:07] Don't like people to stay ignorant.
[1:55:11] of the things that were freely given to
[1:55:13] them.
[1:55:16] Amen. Amen.
[1:55:19] Let's go to verse one. John 1:1. In the
[1:55:22] beginning was what? The word. Please
[1:55:24] follow me. I'm begging you. And the word
[1:55:26] was what? With God. And the word was
[1:55:29] what? God. The same was in the beginning
[1:55:32] with who? God. Watch verse three. How
[1:55:35] many things? All things
[1:55:38] were made by who? By him. And without
[1:55:41] water? Him was not anything made that
[1:55:44] was what made. So God created everything
[1:55:48] by the second form.
[1:55:52] Yes sir. I don't know if you talk you
[1:55:54] understanding me. That's right. When I
[1:55:57] say shows,
[1:56:00] it's a word. That's right. Yes. But that
[1:56:04] word is not just word. It has a meaning.
[1:56:08] It's speaking about a person that is
[1:56:11] called Charles. Are we together? So the
[1:56:14] word got a touch
[1:56:22] if I tell you
[1:56:24] Joshua in your mind, you know what I'm
[1:56:27] talking about. You even have an image.
[1:56:29] So Joshua is just not a word.
[1:56:32] It's a thought. And as a matter of fact,
[1:56:35] it's a person
[1:56:37] and it's a person talking. But before he
[1:56:40] become Joshua talking and a person and
[1:56:43] whatever you know about him, he was
[1:56:45] first a taught.
[1:56:47] Glory to God. Are we together? Are we
[1:56:50] together? Are we together? So the word
[1:56:53] here is the pe the divine package.
[1:56:59] Follow me my friend of the thoughts of
[1:57:02] God. Amen.
[1:57:05] Amen. Amen. So every every thought that
[1:57:08] was in God, God poured them all in the
[1:57:12] word.
[1:57:14] Follow me, my friend.
[1:57:16] Follow me, my friend.
[1:57:18] And God enter the word and begin to use
[1:57:22] the software of the word to create
[1:57:26] everything.
[1:57:27] [Applause]
[1:57:29] And there is nothing that existed
[1:57:32] That was not created by the word. Amen.
[1:57:37] That word is called theophony.
[1:57:40] It is called the pill of fire. It is
[1:57:43] called the logos.
[1:57:45] [Music]
[1:57:45] [Applause]
[1:57:47] [Music]
[1:57:49] So the logos is the one that have every
[1:57:53] thoughts of God
[1:57:55] inside him. Amen. If you want to know
[1:57:58] things about God, make a contact to the
[1:58:02] logos.

[1:58:09] thoughts of God, contact the light,
[1:58:13] [Applause]
[1:58:18] contact the pillar of fire,
[1:58:21] contact the theophony. That's why before
[1:58:25] brother Brham start the discernment

[2:06:41] what? Tempted and what and tested by
[2:06:44] sin. Like who? Adam did. And when the
[2:06:46] testing of the word, his word is what?
[2:06:50] Then we are what? Taken up to this body
[2:06:53] that was what? Prepared for us when
[2:06:56] before the foundation of the world. It
[2:06:58] is the word that we did what? Skip.
[2:07:03] [Applause]
[2:07:08] You skip what? That's why you are
[2:07:11] ignorant.
[2:07:16] But God say I know. I know. In other
[2:07:18] words, I have your theophony. I know.

[2:07:52] tempted and tested. If we had come
[2:07:54] through that brother
[2:08:05] there will have been what? No
[2:08:07] temptation. In other word,
[2:08:10] in other word, you don't understand who

[2:09:07] Jesus did it with a theophony.
[2:09:10] You are doing it without theophony.
[2:09:14] [Applause]
[2:09:15] That's why the work that I do
[2:09:18] [Applause]
[2:09:20] you shall do it even how
[2:09:24] [Applause]
[2:09:29] are we together? Can I continue?
[2:09:33] Hallelujah. He says, "If we had come

[2:09:38] No temptation. We would know what? All
[2:09:41] things.
[2:09:45] You will know what all things. All
[2:09:47] things. There won't be no mystery to
[2:09:49] you.

[2:10:26] Are we together? I am still at the
[2:10:29] beginning. Now, where are you going with
[2:10:31] this pastor?
[2:10:33] Because of this,
[2:10:36] we lost our knowledge. That's correct.
[2:10:39] Amen.
[2:10:41] Because of this, sir, we are not aware
[2:10:44] of the free thoughts
[2:10:48] of the things God prepared for us. Of

[2:13:34] the software this man is operating was
[2:13:37] not meant to operate that. That's right.
[2:13:40] Amen. He needed a different software.
[2:13:43] The Bible say, "For my thoughts,

[2:15:00] can read the Bible and when you connect
[2:15:04] to the theophony, you begin to see that
[2:15:07] scripture differently because the
[2:15:09] theophony begin to teach you.
[2:15:14] He's using the preacher and you say, "Oh
[2:15:17] my god, I see it now." That's why the
[2:15:20] Bible says this. It is your theony
[2:15:23] proceeding.
[2:15:28] Amen. And you talk to somebody, he say,
[2:15:30] "How did you know this?" Yeah, it's in
[2:15:33] the Bible. How do you know this? How do
[2:15:36] you know it?
[2:15:38] Did you go to school to know it? How do
[2:15:40] you know it? Somebody's teaching you.
[2:15:43] Somebody who knows the word. Because
[2:15:45] that person is the word.

[2:16:22] there and somebody look at me and say,
[2:16:24] "Do you need a job?" And then you ended
[2:16:26] up working in Walmart. But that person
[2:16:28] knew you going to work in Walmart.
[2:16:32] If you would have asked him, he would
[2:16:33] say, "Don't worry. Go to Walmart. You
[2:16:36] you will have a job." Yes, sir.
[2:16:38] Confidence. You didn't get me. Well,
[2:16:41] that person would tell you if you want
[2:16:43] to ask for a job, ask for Walmart job.
[2:16:49] [Applause]
[2:16:51] When you say Lord Jesus Christ, give me
[2:16:54] Walmart job. Jesus say yes.
[2:16:57] [Music]
[2:17:00] Because that person knows the mind of
[2:17:02] God.
[2:17:04] Amen. And if you ask anything according
[2:17:07] to his will, his mind,

[2:17:33] with questions. Yes.
[2:17:36] Why?
[2:17:38] Why? That's right. Why did this happen?
[2:17:42] Why didn't I avoid this? Why did I end
[2:17:45] up here?
[2:17:48] Why did I go through this?
[2:17:50] Why shouldn't I even have listened to my
[2:17:53] mother? What makes me move here? I wish
[2:17:56] I would have known this a long time ago.
[2:18:01] Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? All type of
[2:18:05] why.
[2:18:07] Oh my god. Bear with me my friend. A big
[2:18:11] chunk of our life. Why?
[2:18:15] It looks like we move through
[2:18:16] experience. Then we look back. You say
[2:18:19] if I knew this, I would not have gone
[2:18:21] this this this this.
[2:18:24] Lord, why did you let me go through
[2:18:25] this?
[2:18:27] [Applause]
[2:18:30] Now you are showing me a Christian
[2:18:31] should be this this this but you let me
[2:18:33] go through this. Amen. You told me the
[2:18:36] plan you have for me are good for peace.

[2:18:43] Why was I taken advantage? Amen. Why was
[2:18:46] I abused?
[2:18:48] Hallelujah.
[2:18:52] Why did you let me go to the nightclub
[2:18:55] and get drunk first? Why did I end up in
[2:18:58] such a relationship?
[2:19:02] A big chunk of your life is a mystery.
[2:19:06] And brother Brandham say God's will for
[2:19:08] you is a mystery. I have the quote I
[2:19:12] will put it for you. Amen. Amen. So now
[2:19:15] when the seals are broken,
[2:19:20] are we together? The access to the deep
[2:19:24] things of God have opened up. That's
[2:19:26] right. Amen.
[2:19:28] In other words, the mind of God
[2:19:33] the wisdom of God
[2:19:38] has come down.
[2:19:42] [Applause]
[2:19:44] Are we together? To begin to remove
[2:19:49] ignorance for you.

[2:20:09] teacher.
[2:20:11] A true message church is a church that
[2:20:14] have eyes wide open
[2:20:21] because God say come and buy ass. The
[2:20:24] ass has come. Why are you still blind?
[2:20:28] And the William brother
[2:20:30] message the pulpit.
[2:20:33] Shake the pit.
[2:20:35] If the pit is not qualified, change him.
[2:20:45] Are we together? Are we together? I'm
[2:20:49] going to say this easily because it's
[2:20:51] easy for me to speak straight from my
[2:20:53] mind. Many people are pastor. They were
[2:20:56] not supposed to be pastor.
[2:21:05] They became pastor by circumstances.
[2:21:08] [Applause]
[2:21:10] [Music]
[2:21:10] [Applause]
[2:21:14] Amen.
[2:21:18] Don't say amen.
[2:21:23] Because God's sheep must be fed. They
[2:21:27] must be open. They must be taught. They
[2:21:30] must know the will of God for their
[2:21:33] life.
[2:21:35] [Applause]
[2:21:39] I cannot sit in the church where I don't
[2:21:41] see progression.
[2:21:43] I must progress spiritually.
[2:21:46] I must be a growth.
[2:21:49] [Applause]
[2:21:54] Are we together? Are we together? Let me
[2:21:57] back up myself to a different line
[2:22:00] because this is going international. But
[2:22:02] anyway,
[2:22:06] I'm sovereign.
[2:22:09] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. A big chunk of
[2:22:13] our life mysterious. Mysterious.
[2:22:16] But since the opening of the seals, God
[2:22:19] say no more.
[2:22:21] No more mysteries. All the mystery
[2:22:24] should be what? Finish. So now he sent
[2:22:27] us a prophet. Hallelujah. Do you follow
[2:22:30] me? Amen. John saw at the beginning.
[2:22:38] This is how far
[2:22:40] John the revelator can go.
[2:22:48] Amen. Are we together? God sent a
[2:22:52] prophet
[2:22:54] whim your brother to go past the
[2:22:57] beginning.

[2:23:12] will know the secret the things that God
[2:23:19] has laid for
[2:23:20] [Applause]
[2:23:23] us. Jesus.
[2:23:29] How can you be in the message church?

[2:23:33] and you there 20 years. You don't even
[2:23:35] know the church ages. Come on.
[2:23:41] When they say low and the pillar of
[2:23:43] fire, you see somebody.

[2:23:52] You don't know about this thing. No.
[2:23:56] 30 years in milk.
[2:23:59] Muscles in milk.
[2:24:03] Are we together? Amen. God sent us a
[2:24:06] prophet that goes past the beginning.
[2:24:12] In other words, the hour has come that
[2:24:15] we must know the mysteries not only of
[2:24:19] the Bible but the mystery of my Bible.
[2:24:23] It is right there, brother.
[2:24:26] Yes, sir. My Bible needs to be open.

[2:25:39] Brother Brown said, "Who could doubt
[2:25:42] that?" That was what Paul said.
[2:25:44] Hallelujah. That's what Paul's
[2:25:46] scripture. That's what Paul's writing.
[2:25:48] That's what what he taught the church
[2:25:50] his church the church how positionally

[2:37:23] according to the plan. In other word,

[2:43:49] say, "A child born for a
[2:43:57] purpose. When all hope are gone and the

[2:44:31] purpose are we to the are we together
[2:44:34] let's go to the right, to the left, to
[2:44:38] the right. The crocodile passes after
[2:44:40] Miriam is like, he's still alive. But
[2:44:44] for some reason, the GPS is bringing him
[2:44:48] to the very mouth of the devil.
[2:44:50] [Applause]
[2:44:53] Not away from the problem, throughout
[2:44:56] the problem.
[2:44:57] [Applause]
[2:44:58] [Music]
[2:45:02] [Applause]
[2:45:03] Are we together? Are we together? Are we
[2:45:06] together? Because it's him that workketh
[2:45:09] everything
[2:45:11] according
[2:45:12] to this divine purpose.
[2:45:15] He's pushing everything toward his
[2:45:18] divine purpose. Are we together? We look
[2:45:22] like this. The Pharaoh himself
[2:45:26] and suddenly 35 miles an hour
[2:45:30] the thing begin to go. William say, "Oh
[2:45:33] my God, we do. This is the devil
[2:45:37] himself."
[2:45:38] And God is bringing the package.
[2:45:42] And for some reason, God made somebody
[2:45:44] go take a shower at that time.
[2:45:48] Amen.
[2:45:50] Amen.
[2:45:54] What are you afraid of?
[2:45:57] What are you frustrated at?
[2:46:00] What are you worrying about? Nothing. It
[2:46:03] looks like it's getting even bad.
[2:46:06] It's the very purpose of it.
[2:46:09] Are we together? Are we together? When
[2:46:12] the angel reached that point, they took
[2:46:14] off. They say push the brake and the
[2:46:17] thing begin to float.
[2:46:19] The delivery.
[2:46:23] Watch that over there. Go pick it up.
[2:46:31] Miriam. Hallelujah. Father, this is my
[2:46:35] last time I'm going to see my baby
[2:46:37] brother. Stay here. Lord, may you do
[2:46:40] something?

[2:46:52] He's so cute.
[2:46:55] Yes, he she forgot about the Hebrew.
[2:47:01] She forgot about the Hebrew. God
[2:47:04] bringing the child in the very heart of
[2:47:07] hell.
[2:47:14] What a protection. How can you protect a
[2:47:18] child in an environment like that? The
[2:47:21] child was more safer.
[2:47:23] [Applause]
[2:47:32] Then staying a home, a home you lose it,
[2:47:36] over there you gain it because over
[2:47:39] there it's the purpose.
[2:47:47] Miriam comes.
[2:47:51] Father Brandham say why they didn't ask
[2:47:53] her what are you doing here?
[2:48:00] Go read the teaching on Moses. Why they
[2:48:02] didn't ask that?
[2:48:06] And they asking Miam, do you know
[2:48:08] somebody who can take care of
[2:48:14] what turn what you thought was a
[2:48:16] problem?
[2:48:20] It's not a problem. I will get to that
[2:48:22] next Sunday.
[2:48:25] Do you know somebody who can nurse this
[2:48:26] one? He say yes. Yes, madam. They even
[2:48:30] forgot that. What are you doing here?
[2:48:35] He say I can find you somebody
[2:48:39] who inspire William.
[2:48:42] In other words, God is blinding the
[2:48:45] devil himself. Amen.
[2:48:49] Amen. Miam didn't say if I go get
[2:48:52] another mother, it will be better. So
[2:48:54] they won't catch my mother. Uhuh. She
[2:48:56] went back and took
[2:49:00] Amen. Amen. The mother of the baby

[2:49:07] To feed her own
[2:49:12] who provide the milk. Yes. Who provide
[2:49:15] the diaper? You didn't answer me. Who
[2:49:19] provide the milk? Pharaoh. Daughter. Who
[2:49:21] provide the diaper? Pharaoh. Who provide
[2:49:23] the bed? Pharaoh.
[2:49:28] Amen.
[2:49:31] The pharaoh that was making the family
[2:49:33] suffer is the pharaoh that is providing
[2:49:36] for a family. And brother, brother said
[2:49:38] they put her in salary.
[2:49:40] [Applause]
[2:49:43] Amen.
[2:49:47] Brother say it was $300
[2:49:51] of that time. So I'm I'm have an income
[2:49:56] of a child.
[2:49:58] Mama nursing the baby is producing money
[2:50:02] and DSS.
[2:50:04] You are here for a
[2:50:06] purpose. Your life is for a purpose.
[2:50:10] Everything is working together for good
[2:50:14] for a purpose. Let's stop here. God
[2:50:17] bless you.
[2:50:24] Oh, hallelujah.
[2:50:28] Where did we stop? We have not even
[2:50:31] finished this quote. We will pick it up.
[2:50:35] Amen. Amen.
[2:50:38] Amen.
[2:50:40] Sister just keep this on purpose. We
[2:50:42] have to pick up on purpose again and
[2:50:45] then put that together with prayer.
[2:50:47] Church, get off the
[2:50:52] pressure. As much as you thought your
[2:50:54] life was a mystery, it's not a mystery.
[2:50:57] Your life is very simple with all the
[2:51:00] heartache and the trouble that you got.
[2:51:03] And I'm going to show you the purpose of
[2:51:04] the heartache.
[2:51:08] I have it here in the Bible.
[2:51:11] And when you see what it comes out of
[2:51:13] it,
[2:51:15] you will never regret anything.
[2:51:18] Amen. Stop comparing yourself with the
[2:51:21] one next to you.
[2:51:24] Amen. God knows why that one cannot
[2:51:27] drink beer
[2:51:29] and you drunk beer.
[2:51:32] The main thing is you already converted.
[2:51:35] to leave it there.
[2:51:38] Hallelujah.
[2:51:39] Okay. God knows why you have to go
[2:51:41] through that path. God knows why you
[2:51:43] have to be raised by a single mom.
[2:51:47] Lord, leave it alone.
[2:51:51] As bad as he looks,
[2:51:56] your material needed to go through that
[2:51:58] channel. Amen.
[2:52:01] These are hard lessons.
[2:52:04] And you pray and you pray and it seems
[2:52:07] like you can't get through because you
[2:52:09] are praying against something.
[2:52:15] And if they take you off that path,
[2:52:16] you're going to get in more trouble.
[2:52:20] Hey, it's a crocodile here. Don't worry.
[2:52:22] Don't worry. He won't kill you until the
[2:52:25] purpose is finished. He won't kill you.
[2:52:27] Amen. Until the purpose is finished.
[2:52:31] When the purpose is finished, you will
[2:52:33] be the one testifying here. I'm going to
[2:52:35] give my testimony. I want to give my
[2:52:37] testimony. Now you you forget about the
[2:52:39] crying. You want to give the testimony
[2:52:40] so the whole world will understand. You
[2:52:42] will know and will be encouraged. You go
[2:52:44] somewhere. I can give my testimony among
[2:52:46] young sister, among young brothers. You
[2:52:48] forgot how you were crying.
[2:52:52] Let's pray. Heavenly
[2:52:53] Father, Lord, we are approaching you
[2:52:56] humbly this
[2:52:57] afternoon. Father, we thank you for your
[2:53:00] grace for your love and for your
[2:53:05] mercy and for this message that have
[2:53:08] opened up completely and tore down the
[2:53:12] mysterious part of our life so that now
[2:53:15] we begin to understand many things.
[2:53:20] That's why David said that though I
[2:53:25] walk in the midst of a valley of the
[2:53:28] shadow of death, I will fear no
[2:53:32] evil. David understood that even if
[2:53:35] everything is dark, there is a shadow
[2:53:38] following him. There is a God that is
[2:53:42] there. He's not only the God of the
[2:53:45] mountain, he's also the God of the
[2:53:47] valley. He already planned everything
[2:53:50] and there is no places that we go
[2:53:52] through that you cannot go.
[2:53:55] You even went to the place that we will
[2:53:57] never go. You went to hell and we will
[2:54:00] never go to hell. We are doomed straight
[2:54:03] to go to the rapture.
[2:54:07] Father, what else can we say but thank
[2:54:10] you. Thank you Jesus. May you remove
[2:54:13] this
[2:54:14] anxiety, this
[2:54:18] pressure, every frustration that is
[2:54:20] coming, all the questioning in our mind.
[2:54:24] Today we understood that there is a big
[2:54:26] chunk of our life that we have
[2:54:31] bypassed. There is a big chunk of our
[2:54:33] life that is a
[2:54:35] mystery. But that mystery, the end of it
[2:54:39] is expected. The end is a good hand.
[2:54:43] It's a hopeful hand. You have a future
[2:54:46] for us. You have a plan of peace, Lord.
[2:54:49] Father, may you bless this
[2:54:51] congregation. I went a little bit over,
[2:54:54] but Father, may everything that was
[2:54:56] spoken, may the spirit of the Lord take
[2:54:58] it and go deep again and unfold more
[2:55:02] than what was spoken here. Lord, Lord, I
[2:55:05] spoke about the pulpit and the pastor,
[2:55:07] not to make myself like the only pebble
[2:55:10] on the beach. We are many, but Lord,
[2:55:13] Father, the hour has come where wrong
[2:55:15] have to be called out because your
[2:55:18] children are suffering for these type of
[2:55:21] things, Lord. But Lord, Father, I pray
[2:55:24] that you provide adequate food, Lord.
[2:55:27] because you say that the field is there
[2:55:29] but you ask us to pray for the labor so
[2:55:32] that they can go work on your vineyard
[2:55:34] Lord. Father send them to deliver your
[2:55:38] children
[2:55:42] and to remove anxiety
[2:55:44] so that we know that you are taking your
[2:55:47] time. You are doing everything the best
[2:55:50] and you making everything right just
[2:55:53] right for us. Father, may you protect us
[2:55:56] and I claim the blood of the lamb, Lord,
[2:55:59] upon this congregation. And I pray again
[2:56:02] for a quick recovery for our sister
[2:56:04] Lily. May you bless her, Lord, and
[2:56:07] remember everything. Father, maybe this
[2:56:10] sermon was preached for one person, but
[2:56:12] Father, you are speaking to many people
[2:56:15] in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. God
[2:56:19] bless you, church. We love you.
[2:56:25] [Applause]
[2:56:41] A
[2:56:43] maker. I
[2:56:45] have a maker.
[2:56:49] [Music]
[2:56:53] He formed my
[2:56:57] [Music]
[2:57:01] heart.
[2:57:03] Before even time
[2:57:08] began, my life will
[2:57:12] sing his name.
[2:57:20] He
[2:57:21] knows my
[2:57:26] [Music]
[2:57:27] name. He
[2:57:29] knows my
[2:57:35] [Music]
[2:57:44] every
[2:57:48] me. I have a
[2:57:52] father. I have a
[2:58:01] father. He calls me his
[2:58:09] own. He'll
[2:58:11] never
[2:58:13] leave me.
[2:58:17] No matter the way I
[2:58:21] go, he knows my
[2:58:25] name. He
[2:58:27] knows my name.
[2:58:34] He
[2:58:35] knows my
[2:58:41] every
[2:58:43] [Music]
[2:58:52] sing this morning. He knows my
[2:58:57] name. He
[2:58:59] knows my name.
[2:59:05] [Music]
[2:59:06] He
[2:59:07] knows my
[2:59:13] [Music]
[2:59:23] everywhere I go. He knows my name. One
[2:59:26] more time.
[2:59:30] He knows my name.
[2:59:38] He
[2:59:38] knows my
[2:59:45] every single
[2:59:58] [Music]
[3:00:03] [Music]
[3:00:08] and kiss me
[3:00:10] when I
[3:00:14] go. Oh, and hear me
[3:00:18] when I
[3:00:23] go. And hear me
[3:00:26] when I go.
[3:00:33] [Music]
[3:00:35] Nations are
[3:00:37] breaking. Israel are
[3:00:40] waking up and prophets for
[3:00:45] gold. Gentile is numbered with horrors
[3:00:50] and comfort.
[3:00:53] Eternity soon will
[3:00:57] unfold. The day of redemption is
[3:01:02] near. His heart are filling for
[3:01:08] me. Be filled with the spirit. Your love
[3:01:13] will be
[3:01:13] [Music]
[3:01:15] clear. Look up. Your redemption is near.
