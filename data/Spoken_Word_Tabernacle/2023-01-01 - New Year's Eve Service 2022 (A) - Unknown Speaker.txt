minutes is about the space of a half hour [Applause] so we could have the coming of the Lord here amen how many is happy how many is happy for the blood of Jesus Christ where will we be without the blood of Jesus Christ I wouldn't be here tonight without the blood of Jesus Christ amen glory to God let's turn in our bibles if you would and read a text out of First Chronicles amen sure do appreciate this congregation I appreciate the brother Stephen his direct his honest his Pure Heart First Chronicles 22. then David said this is the house of the Lord God and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel and David commanded to gather together The Strangers that were in the land of Israel and he set Masons to do to Hue wrotstones to build the house of God and David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates and for the joinings and brass in abundance you notice that word abundance uh brass in abundance without weight and also cedar trees in abundance and the zydonians they were they of Tire brought much uh Cedarwood to David and David said Solomon my son a young and tender and that house that has that is to be builded for the Lord must be exceeding magnifico let me read that one more time David had a vision David had a vision brother Stephen has a vision for this assembly he's not responsible for the assembly out in Johnson City Tennessee he's responsible for this assembly here and he has a vision and it's incumbent upon every one of us that looks to this house as being our house of prayer that being our house where we feed our souls to catch the same vision that's brother Stephen has so that we can present to God a a house of God that is magnificent exceeding magnifico of Fame and of Glory throughout all the countries and I will therefore now make preparation for it when's he going to make preparation I will now I will now therefore and one of the greatest tricks that the Satan Satan will pull on a Believer is to let you think there's tomorrow remember sufficient for the day is the evil thereof don't put it off till tomorrow when there was something to be done Jesus got it done he didn't wait till tomorrow exceeding magnifico amen and I will therefore now make preparation for it so David prepared abundantly before his death Lord Jesus Christ we present ourselves to you now father asking you Lord God to feed your children Lord to feed these hungry Souls that have gathered tonight to catch a vision to catch a morsel of your word father so that our souls can be stirred within us so that we can make a preparation Lord God because we know that this Mortal will put on immortality amen that this corruptible will put on incorruption and we know that if the spirit of him that raised up Christ from the dead dwell in us then he that raised up Christ from them amen will also Quicken our mortal bodies by the very spirit that dwells in US amen Lord Jesus we're asking you now father to come and to fill us as our sister sang fill us with the promise that you made amen the Holy Spirit we want a filling we want to refill him amen and Lord we want to just keep on getting filled until there's no more of us I have made a house of Saul grow weak and the House of David graystrong we ask it in Jesus name amen amen amen you can take your seats Hallelujah our God is good and so I want to talk about a magnifico you yes my brother I want to talk about magnifical you but I don't want to spell you y o u amen there's another way to spell you e w e I tried to look that up in French and it's a it's a difficult word to say in French [Laughter] how do you say you in French brother Stephen I'll take it was something different than that when I looked it up but see the reason that David was so excited about making a preparation and and as we know David came to a place in his life in his heart to where he wanted to build a house for God and he went to the the prophet Nathanael and and Nathanael told him initially he said just do everything that's in your heart just do everything that's in your heart and so but then after a little while the Lord came and he spoke to uh to Nathanael and and Nathaniel had to go back to David and it revealed to him that because there had been much Bloodshed that he would not build the house but that his son Solomon would build the house and so therefore David was uh wanted to build a house for God but he couldn't so he did the next best thing he started to lay in store so that when it came time to build the house Solomon would have everything that he needed them to to build the house and he and he would have it in abundance now that's the natural house that's their natural house but there's a spiritual house and when Jesus laid up for us he did not lay up just Joy he gave us joy unspeakable amen glory to God he gave us joy unspeakable and full of Glory yes my brother but the thing that I really want to drive home because if you go back and you read where brother Branham was was building or or they would they had to rebuilt the Branham Tabernacle and it was in God in Simplicity and he's starting to show in there the building of it and he was talking about the masonry and he was saying how I I saw it on the blueprint and it looked just like a normal little old church it looked like just a normal building he said but when I got here and I and I started to look at it he was just talking about how how perfect it was and how wonderful it was how many has ever been out to the Branham Tabernacle quite a few quite a few is there anything fantastic about the brand of Tabernacle it's just a brick building but I challenge you go there and guard in Simplicity and read his account and you would thought it was the Taj Mahal the message that God wants to get across to you yes sir tonight yes sir give you a vision amen so that you can prepare a tabernacle for the almighty God Amen that's magnifico yes sir yes my brother is that what man calls great God calls foolish that's right [Applause] just be a good everyday Bible reading yes rare Warrior on your knees read your Bible be in church when the church doors are open that's right my friends don't forsake the assembling of the of themselves together in the house of God don't do it it's a trick of the devil trying to get you to put off tomorrow what can be done today I've been there every day for 40 weeks well make it every day for 41 weeks don't miss a service yes my brothers let me tell you it was so important that we was in every service that we was in every Bible study yes that their first uh uh Messenger to the church ages told us whatever you do do not have forsake the assembling of yourselves together as you see that day approaching now I want to ask you my friends tonight do you see that day approaching yes my brother do you want to present yourself a magnifical tabernacle do you want to be a little part of the female aspect of Adam are you yes my brother everybody say you come on let's do it one time now we're speaking in tongues now yes my yes sir we sang a little song out at Youth Camp you may know it I don't want to be a goat nope I don't want to be a goat nope cause a goat ain't got no hope nope how many knows how many knows it was we the only one to know come up here help me sing it bro I don't want to be a goat nope I don't we're here to have a little bit of fun tonight we're here to give the devil a black eye we're here to get a vision give that man a microphone [Applause] you know Isaiah's my friend all the verses you'll know him as they come on and once you catch up just just come along with us now okay I don't want to be a goat nope I don't want to be a goat nope cause a goat ain't got no hope nope I don't want to be a goat no I don't want to be a Pharisee I don't want to be a Pharisee cause a Pharisee ain't fair you see I don't want to be a Pharisee do you know what sunshine I don't want to be a sad to see [Music] because it's sad to see he's sad you see I don't want to be a sad to see now what do we want to be I just want to be a sheep yeah I just want to be a sheep yeah cause the Sheep is really neat yeah I just want to be a sheep yeah amen [Applause] glory to God we cry out for the Holy Spirit but the Holy Spirit isn't a bunch of knowledge the holy spirit is an anointing that gives you the same love the same peace the same joy that the rule that the the son of man himself had Jesus Christ now consider this with me for a minute John was baptizing in the Jordan and he looked up and he saw one walking towards him the lamb that was the second Adam Paul taught us that in the mail aspect it amazes me what gets taught here and then you listen to brother Chad Lamb and he's teaching a thing ain't it so and there's others too this is an anointing this is the teaching that Jesus said would come and it would be that actual teaching that would give us the preparation for the Rapture rapturing faith it would start the rapturing faith follow this with me I'm going to try to get it out the way the lord gave it to me he said when when Jesus came he came in the River Jordan which was death and we know he wasn't dying for his sin he was dying so that I could come here tonight and take communion with him I am not here based upon my righteousness I am here covered by his blood and thrusting that that that his righteousness has been invoked upon us and so he came to to the Jordan and there was Elijah standing in the Jordan to baptize the second Adam yes now consider this in the latter days God sent another Elijah anointing to baptize the I don't want to say second Eve the female aspect of of the second Adam in Jordan death to self are you with me so far by the washing of the water of the word and that's why the word that's coming out now is not just a a Baptist word or a Methodist word or or Pentecostal word or even uh another uh message uh uh idea of what brother Branham was trying to say not some man's idea this is the actual Mind Of God being poured out upon a special group of people and catching the vision we have got a desire to make a preparation so that when Jesus comes to to to change our mortal bodies to Immortal because we know that this mortality will put on immortality but how is the change going to take place there must be a spirit laying inside of us in order to affect that change and it's the same spirit that came down on the River Jordan yes on the Lord Jesus Christ and you remember when he came down he came down as a what he descended from Heaven as a dove and so we got the meekest bird coming down upon a lamb of God if it had been a wolf he couldn't have took it no sir he couldn't have stayed no so Lord help me there's so much there's so much to get but but now here we are in the last age and we are being baptized amen we are being baptized with the word of God Amen the Waters of Separation yes my brother we are being baptized in a in a word that literally separates takes away the desire for sin amen amen amen I don't mind telling you brothers and sisters since being in this assembly and hearing the words that have been coming across this Pulpit there are things that used to bother me they don't bother me glory to God it's gone [Applause] and I don't have to worry about waking up tomorrow morning and still having a temper still getting angry about dumb stuff [Music] hallelujah hallelujah you say you said Brother Sam not you well I'd have sister Teresa come up here but I'm afraid just how much she would tell hey look friends if we can't be honest with ourselves amen I I don't want to be no hypocrite I don't wanna I am not standing here in my righteousness [Music] I'm standing here for the hope that lies within me and I heard the Apostle Apostle of the Apostle say every per I think it was John said everyone that has this hope in him should purify himself even as he is pure amen amen amen amen now here's what we run into we we we tried to do a work for God and we're sincere in what we're trying to do and brother brother Branham said if the devil if if he can't get you to to to stop coming to church then he'll try to push you into a fanatic so what I'm trying to get across in this simple message tonight something that you can take home and chew with you in order to be magnifical in the eyes of God you just have to be ordinary [Music] yes my brother [Applause] let me tell you something if you're a Christian you're gonna be hot enough [Applause] isn't God good amen let's take a look at a Little Lamb we know that that uh well they give milk they're good Dairy Producers some countries depend on sheep for their for their Dairy but their main uh product that they produce is there wool what do they have to do to produce well let me just say this they have to follow the shepherd and he's going to lead you into Green Pastures by The Still Waters so brother Seth we're going to be able to both eat and drink we're gonna eat on the body word of the son of man [Applause] we're gonna drink his blood and we're going to be filled with his spirit and his spirit will make you jump it will make you shout it will make you dance but if you're proud I'm going to tell you right now you don't have his spirit I don't care how much you jump how much you shout if you're religious and you can't reach out to your neighbor and you can't help somebody that's down and out and you can't find somebody with purple hair and have the same feeling for their soul as you got for your own soul that I'm here to tell you you do not have the spirit of God you're nothing more than a Pharisee you're nothing but a sadducee and I'm gonna tell you you can always tell us sad you see because they're always sad Amen brother ain't nothing but the truth yeah oh man praise the Lord oh I want to tell you something this house we have is to be filled with joy and speaker it's to be filled with a peace that passes all understanding who can understand the peace that Paul and Silas had after they were beat whipped put in stocks and then they had the wherewithal not only to sing praises to God until the Holy Spirit came down and set him free but then the go find his adversary and preach salvation to his adversary how many would like a test of your Holy Ghost now don't raise your hands this is you don't have to you don't have to don't even Grim us don't don't don't don't just listen to this you'll give yourself away stay very blank faced now you know there's a person who's going to betray you you know that when this person betrays you you're going to go to your worst the most cruel punishment now this is the anointing that was on Jesus Christ the cruelest punishment that ever faced a human being crucified hung up on a cross naked before all men and you know this is gonna happen how many of you we'll get down on your hands and knees and wash his feet do we have the love of Jesus Christ This Love that loves the enemies is what we need to make our house magnifico you say what I'm going to admit to you brother Sam I don't know if I could do that you can't and neither can I that's why it's incumbent upon us to spend every moment every waking moment and commit every sleeping moment into the hands of the one who can not only can but he did turn with me to Luke chapter 6. this scripture revolutionized my heart when I first read it Luke chapter 6. and this word that's used in here for evil for evil I want you you'll see it when we get to it is the same word that John used over when he was talking about Cain who was the son of the wicked one so the word evil here is wicked one watch this six six let's start up here um with verse 32. for if you love them which love you what thank have you for Sinners also love those that love them and if you do good for those who do good to you what thank have you for Sinners also do the same and if you lend to them with whom you hope to receive well thank have you for Sinners also lend to Sinners to receive as much again but love ye your enemies and do good and lend hoping for nothing again and your reward shall be great Now read these words very carefully coming up here and you shall be not shall be called a lot of people read that says you shall be called it doesn't say that if this Spirit of loving your enemies is in you you shall be the children of the highest now are you following me now watch this for he is kind unto the unthankful that's right and to the evil that word there is literally the evil one that word for evil is wicked one he is kind to the wicked one if you want your make preparation make preparation look at I'm not here trying to tell you to be something that you're not all we want to do is we want to judge our growth and the word magnifical if you go back and read the definition of it it has to do with growth and with growing and so this is something that we're growing into and we do not want to be religious message people we want to be the Lamb of God not to come and take away the sin of the world but the Lamb of God that has our sin already taken away if we have our sin taken away then the same spirit that was in Jesus Christ will dwell in us and it's by that same spirit that will literally take this Mortal body and we'll make it Immortal and so shall we ever be with the Lord there's nothing nothing mysterious about this to a revelated ear lier let me say that again there's nothing mysterious about this to a revelated ear turn with me to Matthew 11. I didn't look what time I started brother Stephen maybe I should have verse 25. at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because you have hid these things from the wise and prudence and has revealed them unto babes that word revealed means that he just opened it up it's nothing difficult if I had a sculpture up here if if I had if I had this thing draped over with a drape and you didn't know what was on this board and then I come along and I pulled the sheet off and then you looked up there and you saw the writing it wouldn't be a mystery to you no more because somebody pulled it off friends it takes a a constant hunger to be in that word and to constantly be comparing your life to the life that's being described in that word and then when you can look in there remember brother Brown told the story about the Chinese laundromat and he would take that piece of paper and he would rip it this way and rip it that way and then he'd give half to in heaven so what it is is we've got the life of the Lamb of God that took away the sin of the world and it's clearly spelled out here in the Bible so now we take our life and we match it up and if it's not matching it doesn't mean you're not a seed of God it just means that you got to grow a little more so don't try to do some super duper just keep coming to church keep reading your Bible keep praying now look I'm getting ready to be finished let's turn over to Hebrews chapter 10. Hebrews chapter 10. now while we're on this journey we we need some some good food good food and you know lettuce is good food you know why lettuce is good food it's got opium in it it makes you relax you're not nervous you're not tense I believe it makes us relax so much that the wolf could be right there remember the story brother Bram told about the Eagles the legal it's playing in the meadow the the wolf whatever the wolf was right there but those little eaglets wasn't one bit worried about him brother Brennan was wondering why aren't they worried and then he looked over and he said oh mama Eagle up there said if that if that uh wolf ever took after them I think it was wolf I can't remember exactly said if it ever took after those Eagles have Mama Eagle come down and flog that thing to death they had perfect confidence so let's see if we can find some lettuce here that'll help us out let's drop down to verse 10 22. these are simple instructions let us draw near with a True Heart and the full Assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he's faithful that promised Amen Let Us consider one another we're a family we got to be here for each other we need to pray for each other if you see somebody going through a little bit of something don't shut them reach out to them be a friend you know there's a religious idea to this message and if it's somebody that's not like us we would that they're they're anakama but just remember inside of that little anathema there might be a seed of the Living God and brother Branham said how do you know if you don't go over that little Harlot along the road they're a little prostitute and say a kind word to her that you might find a donated seed in there that was just the reason that she's like that is because nobody loved her to begin with but then you start watering that with a little bit of personal touch and the water of the word and before you know it shall blossom in to a uh into a a child of the Living God amen amen let us hold fast uh the profession of our faith without wavering and let us consider one another to provoke one another to love and to Good Works read with me everybody not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much more as you see that day approaching amen God bless you very much amen thank you let's give the Lord a clap of faith amen amen amen glory to God my goodness Hallelujah I'm not going to tell you what I saw in this scripture I'm just gonna leave it alone hey man it's a powerful scripture everything in abundance in abundance in abundance there is a reason why you have to be abundance and if you so if you check you see David that he did I was just looking at right there it's David that put everything in abundance but he didn't build the house the house has to be built by Solomon there is a reason why Solomon have to do that but let me leave it alone so you don't lose focus but your message is hidden right there the Thunders are hidden right there the change of the body is even hidden right there brother Kelly come on glory to God it is so powerful amen wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful hallelujah hallelujah the house the material laid by crust a type of David but he laid the material abundantly Christ brings the material abundantly come on brother Kelly before I disclose the faith [Laughter] Brother Sam I tried to Signature to keep going yeah the the youth up there and brother Abraham I couldn't take the tie off and give it to them so so I guess you all have to hear from me tonight huh oh let me hear timer on so Lord's willing that you know sometimes we have senior moments right Hallelujah okay let's see what we got here okay thank you Jesus okay amen thank you for your patience but before we get into the word I wanna thank you all for such a prosperous year I tell you we truly love you God is doing some great things and expecting some greater things and you know in the future here we see what he has done through the spiritual aspects of it of his word which we know that's going to keep unfolding but the main thing is we see the manifestation of it we see the value of the blood we see what the blood is doing we see what the bloody word is doing now so they'll never let Satan try to beat you down God is working the work and your brothers and your sisters is recognizing what he's doing inside of you Hallelujah Hallelujah you know it's just an honor Lord and brother John you're not supposed to be nervous we'll leave it to the preachers Brother John we always pray for one another brother John and I you know but uh we won't prolong the time let's go to uh Joshua chapter 2. and I'll tell you it's uh and you can stay in but this is the Caleb's mother God bless you amen but just be glad to say a short prayer Lord God we thank you for your grace your mercy we thank you for this opportunity Lord God for the pastor Lord God the deacons the trustees and all the laity and musicians Lord Jesus but most of all we thank you for your presence so we give you praise we give you honor we'll give you glory in Jesus name we pray amen amen and verse 8 if you have it Joshua chapter 2 verse 8. he says and before they were laid down she came up into them upon the roof and she said unto the men I know that the Lord have given you the land and that your Terror has fallen upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land think because of you may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated you know just a little thought that I tell you was just pressing in my spirit we'll see which way you want to go is I know I know you know it's something you say I know you know when you know something you know then you know that you know that you know because God has made it known to you when you know something then I mean deep down inside brother brother Sam it was just a confirmation when you mentioned that Harlot you know because we know Moses had died right and when Moses had died and like they said Moses wasn't able to take them into the promised land is that right so when Moses wasn't able to take them into the promised land but we know that someone was going to come along and Lead this into the promised land is because God says so is that right he made a covenant with Abraham back in the Book of Genesis is that right that he was going to have us in a land that's flowed with with milk and honey is that right well we're in the land right now foreign [Applause] see when you know something you know we were sharing a little lesson in the institution you know we went over there in Matthew is that right that's when the Matthew real quick and we'll come there Matthew 2. see when you know Hallelujah oh I tell you y'all young man I'ma start doing some hard praying I need to do I need to do better we gotta put some fire up under them Pastor huh see I like to eat yeah yeah huh I like to eat you know the spiritual the natural types of spiritual you know about the vanilla pasta I changed my diet yet I don't need I mean Eagles food now Brother Sam I can add lettuce to it now ah huh so naturally you know I had to cut out the food when you started you were getting a little older you got to watch your diet is that right huh so we're talking about when you know something and we're going to see brother Brandon talked about this here and with him an institution look at verse 1 Matthew 2 and verse 1. he said now when Jesus was what born in Bethlehem we know that's the what the house of God's bread is that right he said now in the days of heroin the king is that right now remember this was just another heroid heroin was a name of tradition huh right they don't like this pastor because their tradition is getting ready to get broken down when that word start coming open when what after the resurrection and it was on the road Emmaus they brought the word with understanding is that right now the person can move when understanding comes your confidence come when confidence comes your faith come then your Revelation comes of the word and then it becomes what a performance is that right religion versus salvation you know when I go there and going to the institution Pastor see he he told me I heard brother Brandon said hunt my bride he said go hunt my bride This is the End Time message judge I cannot go in there with a religion denominational teachings is that right no sir those demons will eat you up is that right huh we're in the war is that right we're in the war is that right he went into the gates huh when he entered the gates umbrella he said he just finished a war didn't he huh he was a mighty award the battle was over is that right he'll come we conquered death hell when the grave Christ comes Christ but look what happened here in Matthew he said now heroin the king see the real king was born he said behold there came wise men from the east of Jerusalem he said now he said say look what they said he said save where is he that that is born King of the Jews yes huh he said now this is what president said this is what pricked my heart he said we have seen his star in the east and come to worship Him he said what shook him up was the testimony it was the testimonies it's the testimonies that we have coming out of here that's what's shaking them up is the testimony let's keep going let's see what happened to all the religious demons let's see what happens is religious demons he said why it was a supernatural actor the May guys were studying the stars when they were studying the Stars uh they recognized something Supernatural we get ready to move into Supernatural but you gotta believe the word that's coming first you don't believe the word that's coming that's what Brother Sam is talking about preparation yes sir amen Hallelujah he said for we have seen his star in the east and I've come to do what worship him he said when heroin the king had what heard these things he was what trouble and all who Jerusalem Jerusalem was the religious capital of the world and there was a religious capital of the world the whole religious system knows who we are is that right they knows what's going on because it's sick because it's shaking their Kingdom you know why because that demon that once troubled you he went back to where he came from listen to what we're talking about we're talking about the word of God that's why when we were saying Wednesday is that right the infallibility the infallible word of God it cannot fail so we are the vessels that God are using but why say that but when the spirit of God has become oh Pastor thank you for backing me up Wednesday but the spirit of God has to come is that right to move that word is that right the Holy Ghost has to come in your life for you to be that testimony that we're talking out in this hour help me Lord he shook him up he wasn't no play they were not happy to see Jesus if any of you got issues with your denominations those denominations are not happy to see Jesus he was too wise to make a mistake too righteous to do any wrong they were not happy to see Jesus because in the beginning was the word the Word was God the word was with God and the Word was made flesh now now when the word is bringing down it's being performed right it's performing in the end time exactly what it's supposed to do now is unfolding and it's giving you you know what you're getting you have to realize how blessed you are you know I still have to minister just the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ in the institution they can't even see that you're talking about titles versus the name and your heart is heavy and there's so much that we're getting but I thank God he said at the Gold holy world just preach the gospel but the gospel don't come and let her only it got to come in power in demonstration so I'm able to tear down the religious demons is that right when you can hit the religious demon because we got the fullness of the word so you got to understand you're going to be challenged and you got to know where you stand at you got to know what you got you got to know who you are you got to know where you come from when you got a demon that come up to you and start telling people in inmates in the institution you just in that cell block uh now if something happened the officers up up in the booth now they gonna get to you and when religious demons come at you and brother Steve telling the majority of them in this block that his name is Yeshua you are and then what one day when the spirit of the Lord fell down and they know and Minister and I said every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God of the Gentiles is only going to answer to the Lord Jesus Christ I said right now bring Yeshua and I stand Here with Jesus Christ let's see which God be God [Music] yourself the real one it's a real war when Jesus went down to the pits of hell he had control of that he took the charge to them these demons why because people need to be set free is that right you're dealing with murder demons they're dealing with lots of demons you're dealing with pornography demons you're dealing with these students alcoholic demons you know you should see them cry when you go there with the gospel the good news when you tell a man uh and you look at his face and you say you did drugs you did alcohol you're stealing you do a a cocaine how drinking smoking and you look at a man and you tell that man huh let me tell you something or you're drinking now are you smoking now are you shooting dope now are you robbing now and it hits him something strike them down inside I said because that demon left you right it was never you it's not you it was never you have that Satan messing with your mind making you think why aren't you doing it now then you see a man and say spell your heads then you say who want to accept Jesus Christ as a personal Savior and you see the hands go up why nothing that I did Jesus came on the scene go ye all the world and preach the gospel I'm telling you what we're getting here I heard he said look he said we heard the king of the Jews we have has seen his stuff he had a testimony and come to do what worship Him He says we will he said we will be God all the chief priests scribes and the people together and he demanded who with them where Christ should be born and they said unto him Bethlehem or Judea for thus it is written by the prophet we go up here but he said let's turn back to uh don't just turned back over to Joshua I just wanted you to see that because it just dropped in my spirit they saw the supernatural brother random said they saw the supernatural up there in the sky and the supernatural sign is what drew them he said look rehab look at here a harlot our sister that we gonna see that's the lineage ah look at that seed huh just like that woman at the well look what he said verse 8 he said then before they were laid down and they came up upon the roof and they said unto men I what I know that the Lord have given you the land and that your Terror has fallen upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land what faint because of who you we know what the Lord had sent us pastor we know that the Lord hit you for years we know that he had to hide somebody to understand a mystery to bring him what to bring him so that he got saved the best for last they know what they're viewing they know what they're seeing they know that God is with you that's why they say the same way when the Nicodemus he said what Rabbi we know we know the religious demon know because God has to be with you when you're doing all these Miracles all these testimonies all these changed lives we know that God is with you and look what he said here let me keep going before I read the quote I want to read the scriptures because I know the time is limited right he said now and she said unto the men I know that the Lord has given
