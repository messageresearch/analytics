[56:49] with me because see I've been running in
[56:51] the institution I've been running this
[56:53] series about the statute of the perfect
[56:56] man
[56:56] you know brother Steve I got my the ages
[56:59] in the seals is coming in you know the
[57:02] lord gave wisdom how to get them in
[57:04] there is that right so when God give you
[57:06] wisdom to put that in there what did he
[57:08] say we got to go deep sea fishing right
[57:12] and they cannot go deep sea fishing they
[57:15] got to have their ages and they got to
[57:17] have their seal is that right we're
[57:19] going to show you now we're going to hit
[57:21] some hard demons tonight we getting
[57:24] ready to blast some devils that's raised
[57:27] in this message and God by the prophet
[57:30] of God in the end time will show you
[57:33] them spirits that we're fighting against
[57:35] is that right you cannot wrest we don't
[57:38] wrestle against flesh and blood we
[57:40] wrestle against principalities in powers
[57:43] in wickedness in rulers in high places
[57:47] is that right but we got the word is
[57:49] that right is what we say this bride she
[57:53] will not be defeated is that right I
[57:56] don't want to get ahead of myself if you
[57:58] convinced then you're concerned is that
[58:01] right and that's why we're talking about
[58:04] in this hour here now we're not going to
[58:06] lose not a one not your father not your
[58:10] mother not your sister not your brother
[58:13] not your daughter not your son no one
[58:18] will we
[58:20] [Applause]
[58:22] lose huh that's why you got trouble in
[58:25] the message
[58:26] they don't want the seals you don't want
[58:29] the ages well how you going to rap you
[58:32] out of here huh huh brother brandom he
[58:36] turned around and he told him remember
[58:39] he preached the search ages he ran the
[58:41] series on the seven Church ages is that
[58:44] right and then the Holy Ghost stopped
[58:47] them I'mma slow down brother Mickey
[58:49] I'mma do my best brother Mickey he got
[58:51] around there right when he got over
[58:53] there and they stopped him right and the
[58:56] Holy Ghost said you got to preach the
[58:59] stature of a perfect man is that right
[59:03] because the stature of the perfect man
[59:05] came between the ages and the seal is
[59:09] that right because we know there's no
[59:12] way that you can the Capstone can come
[59:16] down on you without the character of
[59:19] Christ being worked up through you
[59:23] [Applause]
[59:27] that's the reason why we had to I was
[59:29] working with them bringing them along
[59:31] slowly but it's been years now you know
[59:34] what brother it's time for me to be
[59:37] concerned uh is that right if we
[59:40] convinced that I'm concerned uh that
[59:43] they need to get this rapturing grace of
[59:46] message that's the only thing is going
[59:49] to get them out of here is that right
[59:52] Hallelujah we going to bust him Pastor
[59:55] I'm having a good time with what the
[59:57] Lord is feeding us with is that right
[1:00:00] let's look at he said now when you
[1:00:03] convinced yes sir convince is to bring
[1:00:06] to belief by argument and
[1:00:12] evidence that's why the prophet of God
[1:00:15] said we have to earnestly contend for
[1:00:19] the faith that was once delivered to the
[1:00:23] Saints is that right huh huh huh we
[1:00:27] going to stop them stop them all
[1:00:29] religious demons coming at us thinking
[1:00:32] that we're fighting we're not fussing
[1:00:34] against our brother we're wrestling
[1:00:36] against flesh and blood is that right
[1:00:39] uhhuh every good gift comes from God is
[1:00:43] that right God says that you got to have
[1:00:46] the latter Reign and the former Reign
[1:00:48] you got to have the Dynamics and you got
[1:00:51] to have the mechanics and you cannot
[1:00:53] that's why on a on a dispens
[1:00:56] when Jesus came and he started his
[1:00:59] ministry the first thing he did he
[1:01:01] started teaching them is that right they
[1:01:04] called the
[1:01:05] Beatitudes but he said now what our
[1:01:08] brother Aaron was working with he come
[1:01:10] in the volume of the book uh we come of
[1:01:13] everything if it's a Bible question it's
[1:01:16] a Bible answer is that right no demon
[1:01:20] forces your body is not for demon forces
[1:01:25] your body is not for sicknesses your
[1:01:28] body is not for illnesses Jesus said
[1:01:32] that we are the Temple of the most high
[1:01:39] God huh I have no use for is that right
[1:01:43] sure we on this side we know we going to
[1:01:46] go through things is that right but it's
[1:01:48] your attitude towards something when the
[1:01:52] devil or the doctor says something to
[1:01:55] you it's your attitude how you accept
[1:01:59] what he said uh anything that try to
[1:02:02] exalt itself against the promise of God
[1:02:06] I though have to accept
[1:02:13] that this is the Living God uh we're
[1:02:16] demonstrating this is the resurrected
[1:02:19] Christ is that right he's not dead He's
[1:02:23] Alive is that right where's the miracle
[1:02:26] huh huh where's the Miracles uhhuh
[1:02:30] where's the Miracles is that right a
[1:02:33] change
[1:02:34] life let bear with me I know where I'm
[1:02:37] at Hallelujah can I preach just like I'm
[1:02:39] in out there I'm just old common simple
[1:02:42] preacher is that right
[1:02:45] Hallelujah huh I got to stick away God I
[1:02:49] share you some of the testimonies if God
[1:02:51] give me Grace convince yes sir he said
[1:02:54] now to bring to belief by argument or
[1:02:56] evidence is that right when Peter went
[1:03:00] up there is that right when Peter when
[1:03:04] he first started out uh when you saw
[1:03:07] Peter he would probably he would cuss uh
[1:03:10] he would swear he had a temper is that
[1:03:13] right but Peter had a sea deep down
[1:03:16] inside of him that God was going to use
[1:03:19] him is that right he was going to take
[1:03:21] that nature but still use that nature
[1:03:24] but he was going to use Lo it for the
[1:03:26] kingdom of God is that right when Peter
[1:03:30] first started out the Lord told him is
[1:03:32] that right that he was going to do what
[1:03:34] he was going to deny me three times is
[1:03:37] that right but uh Peter knew he was with
[1:03:40] the Lord he walked with the Lord but
[1:03:43] Peter was convinced is that right when
[1:03:45] he told Peter to do what cast that net
[1:03:48] is that right Peter cast that net he
[1:03:51] said well he said it I'm going to cast
[1:03:54] it cast The Net to the deep is that
[1:03:56] right we bringing what is he teaching me
[1:03:59] he's teaching us to be Fishers of Men is
[1:04:03] that right if he came and if he came and
[1:04:06] he showed us that we have to be what on
[1:04:09] the son of man Ministry is that right
[1:04:14] now the son of man Ministry I won't go
[1:04:16] into the other portion of it it was
[1:04:18] going to the Jews but he was showing the
[1:04:21] Jews what was going to happen when the
[1:04:23] two witnesses come too is that right
[1:04:25] right on have time I let the pastor deal
[1:04:28] with that we just hitting the surface on
[1:04:30] some things to bring you up now cuz
[1:04:33] that's going in you're looking that six
[1:04:34] seal is that right it tells you about
[1:04:37] that so what we're talking about here
[1:04:39] now is Peter being what convinced is
[1:04:43] that right once Peter was convinced
[1:04:46] Peter saw the Supernatural is that right
[1:04:49] when he saw the supernatural when we
[1:04:51] throw the gospel net he said he was
[1:04:54] going to teach us how to be fish
[1:04:56] of men so when I go out I got to find
[1:04:58] out where the fish is is that right and
[1:05:01] the wisdom don't come from God but God
[1:05:04] has taught me why by the grace of God
[1:05:07] first P second P third PO is that right
[1:05:10] you got to learn out of fish but we look
[1:05:13] but we're fishing in the Deep because we
[1:05:15] about to get out of here is that right
[1:05:17] it's time to go is that right so we have
[1:05:20] to understand he told him to go to the
[1:05:22] Deep so when Peter saw the miraculous
[1:05:26] then Peter knew now I'm going to follow
[1:05:30] him because this is the Messiah that is
[1:05:33] here come on Earth that we've been
[1:05:35] waiting for
[1:05:38] hallelujah
[1:05:39] hallelujah what about us today are you

[1:05:59] nothing unless I reveal it first to the
[1:06:02] servant the prophet is that right Peter
[1:06:05] knew the Messiah was on the earth is
[1:06:08] that right when the Seven Seals came
[1:06:11] open Holy Ghost form the Messiah is back

[1:16:03] Galilee but he didn't tell them to go
[1:16:06] into the upper room brother brandham
[1:16:08] said they went there because the Jews
[1:16:09] was going to kill him he said they was
[1:16:11] afraid that they were going to kill him
[1:16:14] so they went up there it's showing you
[1:16:16] how rough these religious demons are is
[1:16:18] that right and nothing to play with so

[1:17:01] sweet we came in the house of the Lord
[1:17:03] together we took counsel together we
[1:17:06] praised the Lord together he said it was
[1:17:08] one of my enemies what I would have B I
[1:17:10] would have prepare myself is that right
[1:17:13] he said it was one of my own
[1:17:15] gos I got stripped to the back what he
[1:17:19] say quote
[1:17:22] scripture huh like he said I have to
[1:17:25] hide and tell you where I'm getting it
[1:17:26] from I may not have a screen I don't
[1:17:29] mind telling you where I'm getting it
[1:17:30] from searching Paul said if any Angel
[1:17:35] come from Heaven preach any other gospel
[1:17:39] except for the one that I laid down he
[1:17:41] said let it be a what a curse including
[1:17:44] himself is that right he said is that
[1:17:46] right what the holy spirit said brother
[1:17:48] they coming in around in there preaching
[1:17:51] not only another gospel they want to
[1:17:53] preach another Christ they want to
[1:17:55] preach another Jesus uh and another
[1:17:58] Jesus that come along with that other
[1:18:00] Jesus is another spirit that comes
[1:18:03] behind that Jesus so you got to
[1:18:06] understand the spirit that's behind what
[1:18:09] they're trying to bring in but God says
[1:18:12] everything that's hidden I'm going to
[1:18:14] uncover it God said was every was ever
[1:18:17] Buri I'm going to root it up is that's
[1:18:19] what God said is that right
[1:18:25] Peter now Peter was convinced he was
[1:18:29] concerned yes sir now after Peter became
[1:18:32] convinced he went and start ministering
[1:18:35] the gospel look what he said Peter but
[1:18:37] standing up with the who the 11 I'm at
[1:18:40] verse 14 Acts 2 and4 lift up his voice
[1:18:44] and said unto them ye men and all ye
[1:18:47] that dwell at where Jerusalem be this
[1:18:51] known unto you and hearken to my what
[1:18:54] word words for these are not drunk and
[1:18:57] you suppose seeing it but the what the
[1:19:00] third hour of the day but this is that
[1:19:03] which was spoken by who the prophet Joel
[1:19:06] is that right he knew that the spirit
[1:19:09] was going to come they was expecting for
[1:19:11] that Spirit to come so once he's seen it
[1:19:14] come according to the scriptures Peter
[1:19:17] was now become concerned not for himself
[1:19:22] is that right he start being concerned
[1:19:24] for who for Jerusalem for Israel for the
[1:19:27] people the ones that was out there that
[1:19:29] was lost we are now being concerned for
[1:19:33] the sin sick world is that right people

[1:19:43] that's behind that some of you don't
[1:19:46] understand is that right you got to
[1:19:48] understand it's a spirit it's a
[1:19:51] manipulating spirit that you have to be
[1:19:54] careful of and what it does it'll enter
[1:19:57] in through
[1:19:58] murmuring through

[1:32:49] hour here right now is that right that's
[1:32:52] what we're trying to bring you in the
[1:32:53] the Holy Spirit trying to make you

[1:32:57] Tradition tradition is a terrible thing
[1:33:00] is that right is really is uh you got to
[1:33:04] realize what God is bringing us to he's
[1:33:06] going to shape Us by his word why
[1:33:10] because the word the bride loves the
[1:33:13] word she loves to be corrected by the
[1:33:18] word uh the word cannot offend the word
[1:33:23] uh it only you see it only could bring
[1:33:28] you closer and show you who you really
[1:33:31] are is that right the devil thought he
[1:33:34] had us he thought he had us in drinking
[1:33:37] he thought he had us in smoking he
[1:33:39] thought it had us in drugging he thought
[1:33:42] he had us in stealing he thought he had
[1:33:44] him in pornography he thought he had him
[1:33:47] in all these things but then one day you
[1:33:49] heard an eagle cry Hallelujah
[1:33:54] you heard from your theophany is that
[1:33:58] right they say the prodal son when he
[1:34:00] was out there in the world the prodal
[1:34:03] son he was there is that right then the
[1:34:06] Bible says that he finally came what
[1:34:09] unto himself is that right he recognized
[1:34:13] that inner man that Paul was talking
[1:34:15] about over there in Romans 7 we got body
[1:34:19] we got Spirit we got soul is that right
[1:34:22] we got that glorified my body that we
[1:34:25] bypass that was in Heaven is that right
[1:34:28] we're just people we're of
[1:34:31] Eternity we're just people experiencing
[1:34:35] time that's all we're doing we're
[1:34:38] getting back to where we originally come
[1:34:42] from we come from God we're going back
[1:34:46] to God H we are the supernatural being
[1:34:50] is that right he said put on the whole
[1:34:53] Armor of God is that right the natural
[1:34:57] the helmet of salvation what did he say
[1:34:59] in that message that's the outside we
[1:35:02] got an outer Bible and we got an inner
[1:35:04] Bible have we going to get to that in a
[1:35:06] minute you see that's what he's saying
[1:35:09] helmet of salvation breastplate of
[1:35:13] righteousness the preparation of the
[1:35:15] gospel of peace upon your feet The
[1:35:18] Shield of Faith uh but now we got a
[1:35:20] super we got a supernatural arm love uh
[1:35:24] peace uh Joy longsuffering tender heart
[1:35:29] ain't that what he saw on Moses On The
[1:35:32] Backs side when he saw Moses saw God
[1:35:35] walk past him on the backs side he saw
[1:35:38] him like a man but he saw a supernatural
[1:35:41] and anointing on him is that right these
[1:35:44] are Supernatural characteristics
[1:35:47] explained to me
[1:35:48] love show me
[1:35:50] longsuffering show me
[1:35:52] tenderhearted show me mercy that's what
[1:35:56] this bride is made of that's right
[1:35:58] you're the super that's why you love the
[1:36:01] supernatural that's why you love it
[1:36:03] that's why you love Revelation you might
[1:36:06] as well stop they were looking for a
[1:36:08] point for him to stop no no no no no no
[1:36:10] no no when them seals was open it keep
[1:36:13] unfolding it keep unfolding it keep
[1:36:16] unfolding it keep peeling off let me
[1:36:18] keep reading in Timothy we're showing
[1:36:20] you what you're fighting against
[1:36:22] Hallelujah
[1:36:24] help me Lord he at Timothy look what he
[1:36:28] says he says verse six for this sort are
[1:36:32] they which creep into the houses and
[1:36:34] leave captive silly women Laden with
[1:36:37] sins LED away with what div lust ever
[1:36:41] what learning and never able to come
[1:36:44] into the
[1:36:45] what now let's pause that that's what he
[1:36:49] was talking about in
[1:36:51] Hebrews when brother brand preached that
[1:36:54] work that in Hebrews he was saying it
[1:36:56] says had a intellectual conception of
[1:37:00] the message they got an intellectual
[1:37:04] conception of the word they never moved
[1:37:08] on to get the power was to get the Holy
[1:37:11] Ghost is that right that's why you had
[1:37:14] Ruth when she decided is that right once
[1:37:18] you make a decision on
[1:37:21] something always think think of the
[1:37:25] good you done made the
[1:37:28] decision look and think about the good
[1:37:31] of it all things work together for the
[1:37:35] good who them that love the Lord and
[1:37:38] call for what for his purpose is that
[1:37:41] right for His
[1:37:44] Glory Hallelujah look what he says here
[1:37:49] now this where we want this where we
[1:37:52] want to get to he says now as who James
[1:37:56] and jarine with stood who Moses so do
[1:38:00] these also resist the what the truth men
[1:38:04] of corrupt what minds and reprobate
[1:38:07] concerning the what see confering the
[1:38:11] faith they came at Moses they came James
[1:38:15] and jamine came with MOS with sorcery
[1:38:19] they came with in enchantments uh they
[1:38:22] come in these things you got to be
[1:38:24] getting ready to bust the devil in the
[1:38:26] head I'mma tell you how to get them
[1:38:28] right God know you and you know
[1:38:35] you God know you you know
[1:38:39] you when you're praying and then all of
[1:38:42] a sudden a certain Spirit coming at you
[1:38:47] you bind it up send it right back to
[1:38:50] where it come from
[1:38:54] we're teaching you how to fight with the
[1:38:57] word is that right you don't accept
[1:39:00] nothing opposite of the word is that
[1:39:04] right certain demon forces you know when
[1:39:07] we was on the street if a guy locked the
[1:39:09] man up if he got locked up or if he got
[1:39:13] killed or whatever first thing we knew
[1:39:16] now that wasn't his M Mo that's that's
[1:39:18] right something done happened here that
[1:39:20] wasn't his Mo nah he was just a pimp you
[1:39:23] know that's all he was y'all got to
[1:39:26] understand I just use my terminal I grew
[1:39:27] up on the concrete jungle okay okay in
[1:39:31] the Bible they told them you know he he
[1:39:34] he he there was and prostitute
[1:39:36] and things back in that time right now
[1:39:38] the women so gang banging they don't
[1:39:40] need no pimps so you got to get around
[1:39:43] in there now the person got to realize
[1:39:46] right yeah see I see I got to share
[1:39:48] these kind of things with these men in
[1:39:49] the institutions because this is what
[1:39:52] they're familiar with that's their lives
[1:39:55] and if you got to be able to reach and
[1:39:57] fill their
[1:39:58] infirmities is that right or it's going
[1:40:01] to go over their heads is that right is
[1:40:04] a totally different way they Ministry so
[1:40:06] you got to understand is that right what
[1:40:09] how the devil is coming at you you got
[1:40:12] to understand his tactics because the
[1:40:14] Lord said I will not have you ignorant
[1:40:18] to Satan devices so they going to come
[1:40:21] at us with the same word that we got
[1:40:24] that's why I said you got the Holy
[1:40:27] Ghost you got the you got Pentecost and
[1:40:31] you got the spirit of the sons of the
[1:40:33] Prophet we're going to show you we now
[1:40:37] some of you looking at me
[1:40:40] huh huh the pastor already the pastor
[1:40:44] already gave us a deeper Revelation on
[1:40:46] this this here might be a little long I
[1:40:49] was trying to save this to last but but
[1:40:52] y'all keep it keep pulling on it this is
[1:40:55] a witness in the witness
[1:41:01] 4553
[1:41:04] 4553 we're going to take it we're going
[1:41:06] to show you because remember you got to
[1:41:09] go back to the message that the lord
[1:41:12] gave the pastor part 27 open and sealed
[1:41:18] evidence he called it open and sealed
[1:41:21] evidence he came out of Second Kings 2
[1:41:25] and 1 and he was showing you the the
[1:41:28] spirit that was on the sons of the
[1:41:30] prophets you got to know what kind of
[1:41:32] spirits that you're fighting you
[1:41:35] understand that's why in our time they
[1:41:37] say when Muhammad Ali he was he was the
[1:41:40] greatest of whatever his time why
[1:41:42] because he understood the times he was
[1:41:44] in and he understood his opponents you
[1:41:47] got to understand we're in we got 200
[1:41:51] million demons loosed out here now is
[1:41:55] that right and that's why you got to
[1:41:58] realize what you're up against now is
[1:42:01] that right so you have to see look at
[1:42:04] this here and when it when thank you
[1:42:06] Jesus when Ali was in his time H I'm not
[1:42:09] promoting price fighting but when he was
[1:42:12] in his time he had different opponents
[1:42:16] is that right so when he got over there
[1:42:18] and he had to fight George Foreman of
[1:42:21] one of them he trained the different way
[1:42:24] okay he had to train more as a slugger
[1:42:27] is that right but when he but when he
[1:42:30] fought against Joe Fraser he had to
[1:42:34] train different in his training camp he
[1:42:37] had to train to throw to 15 to 120
[1:42:43] pounds of around backing up backing up
[1:42:47] backing up backing up because Joe took
[1:42:50] it to him you see Joe took it to him
[1:42:53] Jo took it to him Joe took it to
[1:42:58] him so was a different fight when it
[1:43:00] came to Joe Fraser Joe knew he was going
[1:43:03] to get hit but you know you going to get
[1:43:06] Affliction on your body you know you
[1:43:08] might get an illness you know you might
[1:43:10] get a sickness but you can look at it
[1:43:12] and say greater is
[1:43:15] he that is in
[1:43:18] thee than he that is in the
[1:43:21] world so you you got to understand you
[1:43:24] got
[1:43:25] 220 some demons 220 million demons loose
[1:43:31] now and these all these demons loose but
[1:43:35] they got to understand they're hiding in
[1:43:38] religion yes
[1:43:40] they and that's why some oh you know we
[1:43:43] get around here why the musicians have
[1:43:46] to do this this this you got to
[1:43:48] understand the first ones that were sent
[1:43:51] out are the s
[1:43:56] you s out there and when you s out there
[1:44:00] you're now you're anointed you're prayed
[1:44:03] up you come and you have to realize your
[1:44:07] position and when you're in that
[1:44:09] position you got to understand what God
[1:44:12] put you there that's why the holy spirit
[1:44:13] said David he was anointed to drive away
[1:44:18] Spirits you see Pentecostal got to
[1:44:21] trying to drum things up because when
[1:44:24] they first came then they used to be
[1:44:27] prayed Up and Under The anointing and
[1:44:30] people used to get slayed in the worship
[1:44:33] service they got delivered in the
[1:44:36] worship service we don't want
[1:44:40] denominational don't bring me that
[1:44:42] Evolution stuff out there on the uh
[1:44:46] radio uh uh or what YouTube you bring
[1:44:50] that foolishness up in here you you
[1:44:53] ain't driving no demon forces away with
[1:44:56] that kind of music you just entertaining
[1:44:59] the flesh we're trying to bring you
[1:45:02] something so you can get and you can
[1:45:05] understand the battle that you're really
[1:45:08] in is that right you're not just
[1:45:10] National you're
[1:45:12] International you got all kind of demon
[1:45:15] forces watching you seeing where you're
[1:45:19] weak at that's why I was talking about
[1:45:21] Al there and he knew see when Jo if you
[1:45:25] were priz fighting Bop if you can hit a
[1:45:28] man with a jabber you can hit him with
[1:45:30] any punch okay so you know if he Bob
[1:45:34] that head you couldn't hit it and the
[1:45:36] devil know if he see one of you out of
[1:45:38] order is that right he can start a
[1:45:41] little Le a Le a whole L is that right
[1:45:45] is that right we got to realize this we
[1:45:48] going in this
[1:45:51] here huh we're in a real
[1:45:54] war and when you're in a war you're
[1:45:56] being trained you're not being trained
[1:45:59] by anyone you're being trained by the
[1:46:02] best is that right you're being trained
[1:46:06] by the unadulterated word is that right
[1:46:09] so you got to realize God is Raising you
[1:46:12] up God is raising them brothers up God
[1:46:15] is Raising you everybody's being trained
[1:46:18] for a work is that right look what he
[1:46:21] says here Witness
[1:46:23] he said
[1:46:25] 4553
[1:46:27] 4553 now we know when they came to
[1:46:29] gilgal over in uh Second Kings it was uh
[1:46:33] chapter uh two over in second Kings
[1:46:36] chapter 2 we know when they came over to
[1:46:40] uh uh gilgal Elijah I mean Elijah was
[1:46:44] about the Rapture out of here okay we
[1:46:48] know that we ought to be concerned
[1:46:51] because we know the prophet of God told
[1:46:54] us Israel is our time piece is that
[1:46:58] right if Israel being our time piece
[1:47:01] then we know this Rapture can take place
[1:47:04] anytime is that right so we know we're
[1:47:07] soon going home we're soon out of here
[1:47:10] so we should now be
[1:47:12] concerned once you convinced you
[1:47:15] concerned now because where you're at is
[1:47:19] the right place God is warning us before
[1:47:23] anything happen we're not concerned
[1:47:25] about a bomb we're not concerned about
[1:47:28] those things falling on us is that
[1:47:30] blowing us to bits or whatever but you
[1:47:33] got to understand Israel knew that they
[1:47:36] was going to have a battle going there
[1:47:38] with hus is that right because hmon
[1:47:42] operated operate according to that law
[1:47:44] Old Testament they dug tunnels like ants
[1:47:48] is that right they put ants in there so
[1:47:51] they had to be I mean they was moving
[1:47:53] like ants so they had to be wise
[1:47:56] approaching them is that right let me
[1:47:59] get let me keep going I want to get as
[1:48:01] far as I can on this by the grace of
[1:48:04] God look what we
[1:48:06] say paragraph
[1:48:09] 199 he said then he started from where
[1:48:11] at
[1:48:13] gilgal huh he started from gilgal and he
[1:48:16] went on to the school of the what
[1:48:19] prophets and I want you to notice when
[1:48:21] he got up there at the school of the
[1:48:23] prophets he said the Lord is leading me
[1:48:26] to Jordan now he had to start moving he
[1:48:30] getting ready to leave God was moving
[1:48:33] him God is moving us we getting ready to
[1:48:37] get out of here he said now look he said
[1:48:40] three stages that Elisha followed Elijah
[1:48:44] he said and Elijah was a type of Christ
[1:48:48] Elijah Elisha the type of the church he
[1:48:51] says I go up to gilgal first gilgal was
[1:48:56] a type of
[1:48:57] justification the prophet of God
[1:48:59] Ministry was first poor second P third
[1:49:03] PO is that
[1:49:05] right bear with me keep your spiritual
[1:49:09] caps on three stages that Elicia
[1:49:11] followed Elijah he says and Elijah was a
[1:49:14] type of Christ he says now justification
[1:49:17] by faith that's what gilgal typed gilgal
[1:49:21] was justification by by by faith and
[1:49:24] then now you say here to the church
[1:49:27] Elijah and Elsia The Young and the old
[1:49:29] Prophet a type of Christ and the church
[1:49:34] he says he says as as your soul liveth
[1:49:37] not I'll stay here but I'm going with
[1:49:39] you he says and he went up to where
[1:49:43] gilgal he says and when he got up there
[1:49:45] he said now you stay here the Lord is
[1:49:48] calling me up to the school of the
[1:49:50] prophets he says and he said as the Lord
[1:49:53] lives and your soul never dies I'm going
[1:49:56] with you I'll not leave you that's the
[1:50:00] church see keep your eyes on Christ
[1:50:04] remember the the pastor was working with
[1:50:07] a series with Elijah he said Elijah he
[1:50:11] had to wait for 10 years because he had
[1:50:13] to learn to step run a straight line he
[1:50:16] had to keep his eyes on the promise on
[1:50:20] what was being preached and brought
[1:50:23] forth in his time I'm just typing it
[1:50:25] there right just bear with me he said
[1:50:28] now look he said the Lord is called him
[1:50:31] he said so he said as the Lord liveth
[1:50:33] and your soul never die he said I'm
[1:50:35] going with you I'll never leave you
[1:50:39] that's the church keep your eyes on
[1:50:41] Jesus whatever he moves on with Jesus
[1:50:43] moves out of Methodist you go out right
[1:50:45] on out of him follow Jesus if he goes
[1:50:48] out of the Baptist you go and follow
[1:50:50] Jesus if he leaves out of the B
[1:50:52] Tabernacle you follow Jesus he says I he
[1:50:55] says I'll never leave no matter where
[1:50:58] Mama belong where Papa belong whatever
[1:51:01] it happens or another I'll go with you
[1:51:04] I'll not leave you Hallelujah I am your
[1:51:07] witness I can't go you're a part of me
[1:51:11] I'mma start jumping down a little bit
[1:51:13] over to paragraph 309 he say three
[1:51:16] places
[1:51:19] justification justification was gilgal
[1:51:22] right he says
[1:51:25] sanctification was the school of the
[1:51:29] prophets huh ah it's going to hit some
[1:51:32] y'all going to have to keep me in prayer
[1:51:34] the devil don't like this let me tell
[1:51:36] you he said look I'm saying where the
[1:51:38] Prophet said he said now the school of
[1:51:41] the prophet and the baptism of the Holy
[1:51:43] Ghost was at where at Jordan right he
[1:51:46] said Jordan where Jordan represents
[1:51:49] death okay at that Jordan represents
[1:51:53] death notice Martin he said he said
[1:51:56] Luther Wesley Pentecost he says dying
[1:52:00] out time still with me we know we pass
[1:52:03] that we're in the bride age is that
[1:52:05] right we're in this world but we're not
[1:52:07] of this world let us keep going he said
[1:52:10] now Elijah walked right down to the
[1:52:12] river Elicia and when they got down to
[1:52:14] Jordan he says and the old Prophet
[1:52:16] reached over and pulled pulled off his
[1:52:18] manle and he struck the waters and
[1:52:21] divided hither and then and two walked
[1:52:23] across he said was on the what dry land
[1:52:29] he said the preachers brother brandham
[1:52:31] said the preacher stood
[1:52:35] off still with me he said they stood off
[1:52:40] and looked at them go
[1:52:49] across now for
[1:52:51] you to you got to go across
[1:52:55] Jordan that's why the original pattern
[1:52:59] of the in time right that was hidden
[1:53:04] under the seals the Thunders in the
[1:53:07] seals remember Joshua 4 you got to go
[1:53:10] back and read I don't have time for all
[1:53:12] that you got to go back to Joshua and
[1:53:14] four and Joshua knew the original
[1:53:18] pattern still with me only Joshua knew
[1:53:22] it
[1:53:23] so at that time remember he said I think
[1:53:26] the pastor was woken that series he said
[1:53:29] that it was it was 12 Stones on the
[1:53:31] outside it was 12 Stones on the inside
[1:53:34] on the inside is that right so now for
[1:53:39] you to know the pattern first you got to
[1:53:42] go get the Holy
[1:53:50] Ghost you got to go get
[1:53:54] it when the pastor worked that he shown
[1:53:58] it was a hidden vessel remembering the
[1:54:00] vessel was going to be Christ he went
[1:54:03] out of
[1:54:04] Jeremiah and as he came out of
[1:54:07] Jeremiah then he went over and when he
[1:54:11] went over there to HH Joshua four he
[1:54:15] went to Joshua 4 let's go to Joshua
[1:54:20] 4 I know this wasn't part of it but
[1:54:22] let's look at it help me
[1:54:25] Lord we come back to
[1:54:28] it I feel some of them right there I'm
[1:54:31] not I'm not against the I feel that
[1:54:34] resistance huh but you're going to get
[1:54:37] it
[1:54:38] anyway huh how you going to get it
[1:54:40] anyway cuz God gave it to me God gave it
[1:54:43] to me I'm not speaking against the the
[1:54:46] the uh Prophet I know who Malachi 4 is
[1:54:50] 1730 huh get on your spiritual
[1:54:56] caps look at verse 19 I think it is he
[1:54:59] says and the people came up out of
[1:55:01] Jordan on the 10th on the first month
[1:55:04] and encamped in gilgal and in the east
[1:55:06] border of Jericho remember brother Steve
[1:55:09] was saying that they went to Jordan he
[1:55:11] had to go to Jordan he said but they had
[1:55:13] to turn to the east a little bit
[1:55:16] remember go back and listen to that
[1:55:18] message it was part 27 open and sealed
[1:55:22] evidence yes sir you go there and you'll
[1:55:25] know exactly what what I'm saying he
[1:55:27] said now he says uh he says which they
[1:55:30] took out of Jordan and Joshua pitched in
[1:55:34] gilgal and he spake unto the children of
[1:55:37] Israel saying when your children shall
[1:55:40] what ask their fathers in time to come
[1:55:43] saying what mean these Stones see they
[1:55:47] go the mystery of asking is that right
[1:55:51] you can ask but the only one had the
[1:55:54] Revelation was the anointing of
[1:55:57] Elijah Elijah knew we going to get I
[1:56:01] don't want to get ahead of myself uh but
[1:56:03] he says ask remember the Holy Ghost gave
[1:56:07] us a a mystery on ask it shall be given
[1:56:10] seek and ye shall find and knock it
[1:56:12] shall be open I know some of you looking
[1:56:15] at me with that look but you need to go
[1:56:16] back and listen to that message and this
[1:56:18] chapter will open wide up for you he
[1:56:20] said now you turn around and you look
[1:56:23] okay let's go back over there I'm I'm
[1:56:27] I'm I'm going back to the quote I'm
[1:56:28] going back to the message I'm going back
[1:56:30] to the message because the Holy Ghost
[1:56:32] don't turn the corner this ain't no baby
[1:56:34] food huh this is not no baby food I'm
[1:56:37] trying to tell you you got people you
[1:56:39] got you got people in this message that
[1:56:41] can quote this message front and
[1:56:46] back and say because they got the word
[1:56:49] they got the Holy
[1:56:50] Ghost and their life don't line up
[1:56:53] that's why brother brandham left the
[1:56:55] church ages and he went to the statute
[1:56:58] of the perfect man before he went into
[1:57:01] the
[1:57:02] seals am am it's a character that got to
[1:57:06] be developed before you can touch those
[1:57:09] seals before those seals are even
[1:57:11] revealed to
[1:57:13] you that's why they don't have the same
[1:57:16] anointing it's too different anointing
[1:57:19] from the anointing that's coming from
[1:57:21] here amen yes
[1:57:23] you got to believe it huh some don't
[1:57:27] believe it they don't believe they got
[1:57:29] they're not concerned so they're not
[1:57:32] convinced
[1:57:34] yet they don't believe they got to have
[1:57:36] the seals they don't believe they got to
[1:57:39] have the fness they don't believe
[1:57:43] it getting ready to tell on them too go
[1:57:46] back and get that message what he gave
[1:57:48] the
[1:57:50] pastor I know them sons of the Prophet
[1:57:53] don't like it I don't I ain't got I
[1:57:55] Ain't Got No Use For The Devil I don't
[1:57:57] care about the devil because I'm still
[1:58:00] representing Jesus
[1:58:02] Christ when I go in that pits of hell
[1:58:05] with them prisoners let me tell you
[1:58:07] something when the co come they took
[1:58:10] away the Bibles and they brought them
[1:58:14] tablets and the Lord had already warned
[1:58:17] us in questions and answers remember the
[1:58:21] pastor couldn't get away from that point
[1:58:23] in questions and answers if it wasn't
[1:58:26] for nobody it was for me when we got in
[1:58:29] there he was telling us because when you
[1:58:32] look at that tablet your mind is not
[1:58:35] just on that Bible now you got other
[1:58:38] thoughts you got movies you got games
[1:58:40] you got everything there so we started
[1:58:43] ministering against it and the
[1:58:46] inmates turn and when the inmates my my
[1:58:51] my my my
[1:58:53] when the
[1:58:55] inmates the inmates I'mma try to find a
[1:58:58] way to pull over when the
[1:59:01] inmates got there because I felt that I
[1:59:05] know that spirit is here how come God
[1:59:08] look God unfolding it now huh why is he
[1:59:12] unfolding it now cuz they don't like
[1:59:17] it I got no use for the devil religious

[1:59:24] age it was a mixed multitude that came
[1:59:27] out every age and the mixed multitude
[1:59:30] caused the trouble the make believer
[1:59:32] caused the
[1:59:37] trouble and so when he come in there you
[1:59:39] got to understand let me keep it going
[1:59:42] help me
[1:59:43] Lord says help me
[1:59:47] Lord look what he says he said it was
[1:59:50] gilgal
[1:59:52] he said the preacher stood
[1:59:54] off and looked at them across he said
[1:59:57] and they got on the other side now
[1:59:59] afterward I hope this soak in the in the
[2:00:02] Tabernacle bones he says not when he was
[2:00:05] he says not when he was that gilgal not
[2:00:08] when he was at the school of prophets
[2:00:10] neither when he was on this side of
[2:00:13] Jordan but after he had crossed over
[2:00:18] Jordan he following him every step of
[2:00:21] the way
[2:00:23] he said now you look and you he said now
[2:00:26] I'm I'm I'mma drop down in verse two uh
[2:00:29] paragraph 23 then what he said I'm going
[2:00:32] to go with you right on through Jordan
[2:00:35] amen I like that why I'm going to be a
[2:00:38] witness of this and he passed through
[2:00:41] Jordan notice here it is I want you to
[2:00:44] get it after he crossed Jordan then he
[2:00:48] said what will you that I do for you
[2:00:52] you he said that's what Christ wants to
[2:00:56] know of the church
[2:00:58] tonight he said after you are separated
[2:01:01] from these things of the world after you
[2:01:03] become a new creature in Christ Jesus
[2:01:06] after you're born again filled with the
[2:01:08] Holy Ghost crossed over
[2:01:14] Jordan those preachers never cross over
[2:01:20] Jordan that's it
[2:01:26] and y'all think it's the pastor sir no
[2:01:30] sir no sir God has giving him
[2:01:34] that it's
[2:01:36] God that's where the attack is coming
[2:01:39] from you can't hide from you can't hide
[2:01:42] nothing it's Christ back on the
[2:01:49] scene huh
[2:01:53] you know what I tell them brother when
[2:01:54] they in there in the
[2:01:56] institution I tell them thank you
[2:02:00] Jesus and after they signed that
[2:02:03] petition they got those Bibles back in
[2:02:07] in the in the
[2:02:09] prison just about two weeks ago
[2:02:14] inmates in
[2:02:17] prison why because they are convinced
[2:02:22] and they became
[2:02:24] concerned and they got the Bible back in
[2:02:28] there we got look at us all that God has
[2:02:33] given us if you're really
[2:02:36] convinced if you really have no doubt uh
[2:02:40] you will be concerned about those lost
[2:02:44] souls that
[2:02:47] struggling we're
[2:02:49] convinced I'm preaching just like this
[2:02:52] probably harder and when there I got to
[2:02:55] fight them religious demons about a
[2:02:58] month we got about two months ago I need
[2:03:00] your prayers we had 39 Souls sign up for
[2:03:05] Christian baptism huh he's teaching us
[2:03:09] how to fish he's teaching us how to fish
[2:03:14] he's teaching us how to
[2:03:17] [Applause]
[2:03:19] fish I'm talking about religious demon
[2:03:23] Matthew 28819 that's a big battle out
[2:03:26] there simple to you but it's a rough
[2:03:30] battle out there getting them to see
[2:03:32] acts 237
[2:03:34] 238 that's what Peter was convinced
[2:03:36] about was he got the Holy Ghost and he
[2:03:39] went up there now Peter start preaching
[2:03:42] he wasn't preaching to some drug addicts
[2:03:45] prostitutes murder homosexual lesbian
[2:03:48] Peter was preaching to religious people
[2:03:51] he Lov those people he had a concern for
[2:03:54] those
[2:03:56] people when you are convinced you will
[2:03:59] become
[2:04:02] concerned let's keep going look what he
[2:04:05] says he said they had the past he say
[2:04:07] they were filled with the Holy Ghost
[2:04:10] after you're born again filled with the
[2:04:12] Holy Ghost cross over Jordan all these
[2:04:16] things of the world is what Dead behind
[2:04:19] you not ask what can do for you like
[2:04:23] this see he said that a double portion
[2:04:27] of your spirit Came Upon me that
[2:04:29] preacher know what he was talking about
[2:04:32] a double portion cause why because I
[2:04:36] wanted to witness that much
[2:04:40] more why did they go to the upper room
[2:04:43] to get the Holy Ghost they went to get
[2:04:46] the Holy Ghost because Acts chapter 1
[2:04:50] verse 8
[2:04:52] said so that they can become what
[2:04:56] Witnesses from all the Earth you see
[2:05:00] once you get it it's like fire shut up
[2:05:03] in your bones it's too many concerned
[2:05:06] about their own problems your own
[2:05:09] situations God is going to take care of
[2:05:12] it God is going to meet your need he
[2:05:15] promised is that right he said I we
[2:05:18] shall do a greater work than what they
[2:05:21] do what did he do brother brandham said
[2:05:25] when God sent him on a mission when he
[2:05:28] sent him on that mission and he had to
[2:05:30] take out the Amit it was uh in the Sun
[2:05:34] and was about to go down uh brother BR
[2:05:37] said J he said
[2:05:39] Joshua created a condition that wasn't
[2:05:47] there what about us huh what about about
[2:05:52] us you need your keys and you really
[2:05:55] need your keys God can bring those keys
[2:05:58] if you what speak
[2:06:01] [Applause]
[2:06:03] it that's what he had when brother Steve
[2:06:07] work in that message he said that Elijah
[2:06:11] see the sons of the Prophet they was
[2:06:13] looking at the man that's why they say
[2:06:16] we got to we looking at an idol no no no
[2:06:19] no we're not looking at the man
[2:06:22] we looking at the Spirit that's on the
[2:06:28] man when he come down and after he come
[2:06:32] down now he said now you look he said
[2:06:35] he's about to leave I'm just
[2:06:36] paraphrasing for the sake of time I know
[2:06:40] just hold your peace huh I'm looking for
[2:06:43] something is that right I got to go
[2:06:46] through there is that right he wanted to
[2:06:48] be a witness is that right brother RAB
[2:06:52] when he went over Jordan he saw the
[2:06:54] right order he saw the right order of
[2:06:58] those stones is that right the pastor
[2:07:00] was teaching that lesson we they all got
[2:07:03] the Bible but they can say brother
[2:07:05] Brandon meant this they could say
[2:07:07] brother Brandon meant that they can say
[2:07:09] brother Brandon meant this uh but until
[2:07:12] uh you cross over Jordan until uh you
[2:07:17] see uh the hidden Stones uh the hidden
[2:07:21] Mystery
[2:07:22] the hidden revelation you under the
[2:07:25] seals the Thunders under the second oil
[2:07:28] Matthew 2 you will not have the right
[2:07:41] interpretation I don't mean to keep you
[2:07:43] this long I got to pull over it's just
[2:07:45] dumping out go back and get what the
[2:07:48] lord gave to
[2:07:49] pastor had a open
[2:07:52] up once you convinced you concern you'll
[2:07:56] be concerned you'll see you'll see
[2:08:01] what's inside of you you are the hidden
[2:08:04] Mystery and then he had brother Steve
[2:08:07] say he said he says
[2:08:10] then Elisha before he raptured out of
[2:08:14] here
[2:08:16] Elisha he just parted it the Jordan
[2:08:20] River
[2:08:22] he said but Elisha when he came behind
[2:08:25] them it was now what you just say
[2:08:29] brother kma you got to speak
[2:08:34] it he said where
[2:08:36] is the god of
[2:08:42] Elijah he got a double
[2:08:45] portion you got to understand he was a
[2:08:49] witness he seen the stones and anointed
[2:08:53] him we are witness the seals are open
[2:08:57] the Thunders is being revealed the
[2:09:00] Capstone I believe them Stones might
[2:09:02] have been a pyramid Rob brother Robert
[2:09:05] those stones might have been built like
[2:09:06] a
[2:09:12] pyramid it's people going to stop it's
[2:09:15] something that's going to make it when
[2:09:17] they become convinced this one this one
[2:09:20] verse come to me
[2:09:22] and I'll stop him come on musicians look
[2:09:24] at acts
[2:09:28] 7 I didn't and and Pastor forgive me I
[2:09:31] didn't even do the revelation of that
[2:09:33] message that the lord gave the pastor
[2:09:35] but forgive me look at this
[2:09:38] here we'll close on this once you
[2:09:41] convinced you're
[2:09:43] concerned because you're
[2:09:46] concern is no longer for
[2:09:49] you that's EXA exactly right brother
[2:09:53] Robert it's it's no longer for you look
[2:09:56] at acts
[2:09:57] 7 and for the sake of time let's just
[2:10:01] look at verse
[2:10:04] 54 verse 54 we'll read down we know
[2:10:08] about
[2:10:09] Stephen he was Marty first mentioned
[2:10:12] this where Saul before became Paul he
[2:10:14] was a
[2:10:16] witness but look how look how our
[2:10:19] brother Stephen was so
[2:10:22] convinced he became
[2:10:25] concerned he said when they heard these
[2:10:27] things he said they were cut to the
[2:10:30] heart and they gashed on him with their
[2:10:33] teeth he said but he being full of the
[2:10:35] Holy Ghost he said he looked up
[2:10:38] steadfast into the heaven and he saw the
[2:10:42] glory of God and Jesus standing on the
[2:10:45] right hand of God and said behold I see
[2:10:49] the heavens open and the son of man
[2:10:51] standing on the right hand of God he
[2:10:54] said then they cried out with a loud
[2:10:56] voice and stopped their ears and ran
[2:10:59] upon him with one Accord and cast him
[2:11:01] out of the city and stoned him and the
[2:11:04] witnesses down there clothed at the at a
[2:11:08] young man's
[2:11:09] feet they threw their clothes at a young
[2:11:12] man's feet whose name was who
[2:11:14] Saul and they stoned stepen calling upon
[2:11:18] God and saying Lord Jesus Jesus receive
[2:11:22] my
[2:11:24] what look what Stephen
[2:11:27] said and he kneel down and cried with a
[2:11:30] what loud voice lay he said lay not this
[2:11:34] what to their what to their charge and
[2:11:38] when he had said this he fell
[2:11:43] asleep those men accept that part and
[2:11:47] you believe and I believe they did a man
[2:11:52] they Stone stepen to death they talk
[2:11:55] about us they put us down they persecute
[2:11:58] us call us holy
[2:12:01] rollers because of
[2:12:04] Sten they'll make it because of Sten
[2:12:08] that charge is not against them because
[2:12:11] of
[2:12:13] Stephen somebody will tell you that
[2:12:15] testimony that's why brother brandham
[2:12:17] always talked about Saul mentioned
[2:12:20] stepen he talked about the testimony of
[2:12:23] Stephen he saw a power of
[2:12:27] forgiveness he saw a power of
[2:12:33] forgiveness and because of him forgiving
[2:12:36] those souls he said charge not this not
[2:12:41] against
[2:12:44] them I said
[2:12:46] look he said look here in paragraph 2:16
[2:12:50] forgive me I said stop but forgive me
[2:12:52] this come to
[2:12:53] me he said he said paragraph 216 you
[2:12:56] asked a hard thing but if you see me
[2:12:59] when I go away it shall be what you ask
[2:13:02] you shall have now brother you talk
[2:13:06] about a preacher watching another one he
[2:13:08] was really watching him he said that's
[2:13:11] what the church ought to be doing
[2:13:13] tonight for a double portion of the
[2:13:16] spirit is watching Christ watching the
[2:13:19] Holy Ghost the the way it moves notice
[2:13:23] it that's why I said it's not the pastor
[2:13:27] it's the holy ghost moving him not
[2:13:30] picking on the sisters not putting one
[2:13:32] down one day you'll become a mother
[2:13:36] remember over in I think is in
[2:13:38] ecclesiastics I mean Song of Solomon he
[2:13:42] said the woman of the dove eyes he said
[2:13:44] first you are brothers and sisters then
[2:13:47] you might become a a a a husband and
[2:13:50] wife down the line is that right so he's
[2:13:53] building us all up so we'll be on one
[2:13:56] mind one Accord and of the message of
[2:13:59] the hour don't no one that take you away
[2:14:02] from those Seven Seals and those seven
[2:14:05] Church ages and that's why he's building
[2:14:07] us up why so the Capstone of Grace Grace
[2:14:12] can rest upon us let us stand
[2:14:17] [Applause]
[2:14:23] I know it was like a shotgun and we were
[2:14:26] all over the placees was nothing the way
[2:14:29] that I guess I won't but the Lord
[2:14:34] know hearts are clear eyes closed head
[2:14:37] bow
[2:14:39] please if you just need something from
[2:14:41] the Lord just raise your hand right
[2:14:43] where you at God bless you God bless you
[2:14:46] God bless you God bless you God bless
[2:14:48] you God bless you Lord
[2:14:52] God we look into the heel to where our
[2:14:54] strength and Our Help Cometh
[2:14:56] From father you know my heart and my
[2:14:59] motive Lord God anything that was said
[2:15:01] or done Lord God that wasn't
[2:15:04] worthy have mercy upon my soul lord
[2:15:07] God but we only come Lord God to get
[2:15:10] oursel out of the way and you had your
[2:15:12] way Lord Jesus I pray that you think
[2:15:15] because Lord God as we look in there
[2:15:17] with Elijah and Elisha which is type of
[2:15:20] Lord God of us going home when Elijah
[2:15:22] was
[2:15:23] leaving Lord God we knew you always it
[2:15:26] was a time for we have to be
[2:15:29] concerned Lord God because once you're
[2:15:32] convinced Lord Jesus Enoch was the type
[2:15:36] of your seventh bride your Seventh Son
[2:15:38] your bride Lord God of the seventh age
[2:15:41] over here your bride age Lord God Enoch
[2:15:44] was the type father once he saw Noah
[2:15:46] start building the ark he know it was
[2:15:49] time for him to leave Lord
[2:15:51] Jesus you showed us Israel Lord God and
[2:15:55] I didn't even get over to Matthew 25 the
[2:15:57] show the second oil Lord God that's why
[2:16:00] you've given that Revelation to the
[2:16:02] pastor Lord God the the five wise the 10
[2:16:06] the five wise and five foolish virgins
[2:16:08] it was actually more than for you uh uh

[2:19:59] evidence again oh somebody's
[2:20:02] lost I'm a pastor I can feel the
[2:20:08] church okay two
[2:20:11] minute okay so you soak in the message
[2:20:14] I'm a
[2:20:17] pastor there are things that you won't
[2:20:19] feel you a
[2:20:23] father have I say something wrong there
[2:20:26] are certain things you won't know until
[2:20:27] you a
[2:20:29] mama they can teach you all you want to
[2:20:31] teach the day you a mama you will feel
[2:20:35] it amen you begin to say oh I understand
[2:20:39] why mama was saying this there are
[2:20:41] certain things you won't understand
[2:20:42] until you a
[2:20:44] pastor
[2:20:46] amen when Israel was coming from Egypt
[2:20:50] they had gilo a city are you following
[2:20:53] me then the next city there was a city
[2:20:56] called
[2:20:57] Beth and then there was
[2:21:01] Jericho we clear and then you move there
[2:21:06] there was the River Jordan somehow
[2:21:09] Jordan was somehow that's why the Battle
[2:21:12] of Jericho you remember what happened
[2:21:14] and everything okay Israel was coming
[2:21:18] following these landmarks here
[2:21:21] and then when they crossed Jordan and
[2:21:23] they went and
[2:21:24] everything finished there I believe they
[2:21:27] were coming from the east or this way
[2:21:29] coming to the promised land so when they
[2:21:31] crossed Jordan and
[2:21:33] everything Joshua told the children of
[2:21:35] Israel that go in the midst of Jordan
[2:21:39] and put 12 stone in there we clear and
[2:21:43] they put 12 stone there and Joshua said
[2:21:46] take again 12 other Stone we clear now
[2:21:49] yes sir and put those Stone outside of
[2:21:52] Jordan we okay so there were 12 stone
[2:21:56] inside Jordan and 12 stone outside of
[2:21:59] Jordan so whenever they finish Crossing
[2:22:02] Jordan the water closed the
[2:22:05] stone we okay now so those Stone nobody
[2:22:09] tempered
[2:22:10] with nobody could change anything you
[2:22:14] you you you needed a submarine to go
[2:22:17] down there or a a tan to go watch those
[2:22:22] Stone there there was no Tartan back in
[2:22:24] the day so he was preserved without any
[2:22:27] problem but the 12 stone outside here
[2:22:30] anybody can change
[2:22:32] them over the year somebody can take the
[2:22:35] order and push this one and push this
[2:22:37] one until we don't know really the
[2:22:39] original picture of the stone maybe the
[2:22:43] stone look like a pyramid over time they
[2:22:46] begin to look like a trap so we don't
[2:22:49] know nobody took this
[2:22:52] screenshot when the stone were placed
[2:22:54] and say okay whenever something happen
[2:22:57] you can repair them this way there was
[2:22:59] no screenshot taken so over the year the
[2:23:02] stone could be tempered but not this one
[2:23:06] so the one who placed the stone is
[2:23:10] Joshua and since Joshua no one was able
[2:23:14] to see the stone here they were closed
[2:23:17] until Elijah came
[2:23:21] we clear and then the Bible says that
[2:23:24] Elijah begin to follow this path in
[2:23:26] other word in the Thunder between the
[2:23:29] line he was telling you that the path
[2:23:32] Elijah was going he was actually going
[2:23:35] following the
[2:23:37] stone you have to read between the line
[2:23:41] are we together so when they reach here
[2:23:44] Elisha struck the water we clear so for
[2:23:48] the first time since Joshua which is the
[2:23:51] to of the Holy Spirit since the ministry
[2:23:54] of Jesus Christ all the way to
[2:23:58] laisha nobody could touch the
[2:24:01] seals we clear you can temper with the
[2:24:04] Bible and you can preach any
[2:24:07] interpretation the Baptist came out from
[2:24:10] here the Methodist say no the picture
[2:24:12] was like this and then the the the
[2:24:15] Pentecostal say no he look like a star
[2:24:18] then the Presbyterian say know he was a
[2:24:21] circle so anybody can come with the
[2:24:23] interpretation but we don't know some
[2:24:25] even can put the interpretation close
[2:24:29] but the only way for you to know you
[2:24:31] need to the original picture and the
[2:24:34] original picture was hidden in the water
[2:24:37] so you need the spirit of
[2:24:40] Elijah everybody okay to strike the word
[2:24:43] of the word and to open the word and in
[2:24:48] the word you can see the he in tunders
[2:24:52] now you can see the original order and
[2:24:55] the original order can help you refix
[2:25:00] the picture the add the stone correctly
[2:25:03] that's why you cannot preach the Bible
[2:25:06] without the message of the hour it takes
[2:25:09] the message of the hour to give you the
[2:25:11] correct picture the correct angle of the
[2:25:16] scripture are we together first of all
[2:25:19] Elijah must do that with elha following
[2:25:24] are we together the first one to preach
[2:25:27] they still have to be brother
[2:25:29] Bram with as the Brad listening to him
[2:25:33] but after the departure of brother
[2:25:35] Branham the mental of brother
[2:25:38] [Music]
[2:25:41] Bram the M that was going with brother
[2:25:44] Bram never left with BR Bram the mentor
[2:25:48] remain with the BR so when when you come
[2:25:50] back with the mentor and you take now
[2:25:54] the Bible and you take the same message
[2:25:58] that preach and when you struck now the
[2:26:01] message of the hour again it begin to
[2:26:05] unfold the Bible in the things that are
[2:26:08] differently even things brother Bram
[2:26:11] never spoke but he would never
[2:26:13] contradict brother Bram we begin to
[2:26:16] understand the message better and better
[2:26:18] and that's when the sons of the that
[2:26:20] stood far away bow down before Elisha
[2:26:24] they never were able to touch the seals
[2:26:27] that's why preacher in this message some
[2:26:29] don't want to attempt
[2:26:33] this that's where the anointing is I
[2:26:36] just did that to put you back in
[2:26:38] perspective what the brother was trying
[2:26:40] to say let's pray Heavenly Father Lord
[2:26:43] we approaching you humbly tonight father
[2:26:47] I'm sorry I say two minute I took more
[2:26:49] than two minute
[2:26:50] Lord It's just to explain and to
[2:26:53] stabilize somebody as a Shepherd Lord I
[2:26:57] felt in my heart and I have to do it

[2:27:33] not con convinced yet May the spirit
[2:27:37] bring that conviction that Godly
[2:27:39] conviction that will bring them to be
[2:27:41] concerned and understand that this is
[2:27:44] not an era of Dos and don't this is not
[2:27:47] a legalistic era but it's an era when
