[1:03:10] there will be an Elijah that will turn
[1:03:13] the heart of the father I'm just
[1:03:15] reviewing you can go back on the
[1:03:16] unchanging pardon of God you will see
[1:03:18] more detail on this there will be an
[1:03:20] Elijah that will turn the heart of the
[1:03:23] father to the children and there will be
[1:03:26] another Elijah that would turn the heart
[1:03:28] of the children to the father where do
[1:03:31] you see this
[1:03:35] this is your own interpretation you
[1:03:38] message people
[1:03:44] in the Book of Luke
[1:03:46] chapter 1 verse 13 the Bible says but
[1:03:51] the Angels say unto him
[1:03:53] fear not Zechariah how many know
[1:03:55] Zechariah
[1:03:57] for that prayer is heard and that and
[1:04:01] that was
[1:04:03] Elizabeth's son and you shall call his
[1:04:06] name who John everybody okay so we're
[1:04:09] talking about who here no John the
[1:04:12] Baptist was brother Branham from a
[1:04:14] Baptist Church too
[1:04:24] and that shall have joy
[1:04:27] and climates and many shall rejoice at
[1:04:30] his birth the birth of who John for he
[1:04:34] shall be great in the sight of the Lord
[1:04:37] and shall drink neither water wine no
[1:04:41] water did Brother Branham drunk wine
[1:04:45] history
[1:04:49] repeat yourself I love this church
[1:04:54] everybody okay I'm not going to preach
[1:04:56] Malachi for you already know what I'm
[1:04:58] talking about amen and he shall be
[1:05:01] filled with water the Holy Ghost even
[1:05:03] from his water mother's womb and many of
[1:05:06] the children of Israel shall he turn to
[1:05:09] the water
[1:05:10] and he shall go before him in the spirit
[1:05:18] [Music]
[1:05:25] did he say the children to the father
[1:05:27] why did they only use a small portion of
[1:05:30] it
[1:05:33] everybody okay according to Malachi 4
[1:05:37] Elijah will do two things he would turn
[1:05:40] the heart of the father and to the
[1:05:43] children and by the scripture who did
[1:05:45] that John the Baptist John the Baptist
[1:05:50] so who is going to turn the heart of the
[1:05:53] children back to the father
[1:05:55] show me one scripture in the Bible where
[1:05:59] this was put somewhere
[1:06:04] do you remember Jesus going into the
[1:06:06] temple one time and they handed him the
[1:06:09] scroll and Jesus opened the Bible and
[1:06:12] instead of reading the whole scripture
[1:06:14] Jesus read up to the middle and he
[1:06:17] stopped and he left another part
[1:06:19] [Applause]
[1:06:21] everybody here because the ministry of
[1:06:24] Jesus Christ we have to be forerun by
[1:06:28] the ministry of John so where John stop
[1:06:31] Jesus stop but there is another Elijah
[1:06:35] that should come and another and Jesus
[1:06:39] also have to come again
[1:06:41] so there is a portion from Malachi for
[1:06:45] and a portion from Isaiah 60.
[1:06:49] [Music]
[1:06:52] did I lose you
[1:06:54] this message is beautiful
[1:06:56] everybody okay so we got to Elijah here
[1:07:01] scripture don't play with let me read it
[1:07:06] again I love that
[1:07:09] the Bible says this scripture doesn't
[1:07:12] play with water words whatever is in the
[1:07:15] record is there for the water anointed
[1:07:19] did you see this this morning
[1:07:22] how many sees that so your eyes are
[1:07:26] anointed
[1:07:27] everybody okay it is there for water for
[1:07:32] a purpose
[1:07:33] the scripture don't stop like that I can
[1:07:36] show you another scripture just like
[1:07:37] this where the Bible says smart the
[1:07:40] shepherd and they only quoted that and
[1:07:43] they stopped right there because the
[1:07:44] second part belonged to the second
[1:07:46] coming of Jesus Christ
[1:07:48] everybody okay
[1:07:50] praise God so let me go back again he
[1:07:54] said and he shall turn the heart of the
[1:07:56] father to the children
[1:07:58] that's John clear over there
[1:08:01] and the Heart of the children to the
[1:08:03] water fathers that's Malachi 4 that's
[1:08:07] William Marion Branham
[1:08:14] you have a problem with that be my guest
[1:08:17] everybody okay
[1:08:19] lest uh come and smart the Earth with
[1:08:22] water occur so before they're coming
[1:08:25] your boss want me to tell you something
[1:08:28] when John the Baptist came you who think
[1:08:31] it's John the Baptist or maybe online
[1:08:34] somebody struggled I don't know who's
[1:08:35] struggling did the earth burn
[1:08:40] did everybody burn no no your boss told
[1:08:43] me to tell you that
[1:08:45] did the earth burn it was everything
[1:08:47] burn
[1:08:48] so did John fulfill that because they
[1:08:51] say before this Burning Day come I'm
[1:08:54] gonna send you Elijah the prophet if
[1:08:57] Elijah fulfilled if John fulfilled this
[1:09:00] entire prophecy after John the Earth
[1:09:03] should have burned did the earth burn is
[1:09:07] the earth burning today but the latter
[1:09:09] came
[1:09:13] is not to turn the father to the
[1:09:16] children but is to take the heart of the
[1:09:18] children back to the father so we must
[1:09:21] see some burning sooner
[1:09:26] everybody here that's why when you're
[1:09:29] gonna walk on the Millennium you must
[1:09:32] walk upon the ashes of the weekend so
[1:09:35] when we're walking on the ashes we say
[1:09:37] brother Branham that was true
[1:09:40] because you should have come before this
[1:09:43] day this day I did scripture have been
[1:09:47] fulfilled we are walking upon the ashes
[1:09:49] of the wicked because a larger prophesy
[1:09:55] amen if I lose you raise your hand
[1:09:59] let's go to revelation 13.
[1:10:07] glory to God
[1:10:11] it's Sunday
[1:10:13] one service
[1:10:16] take your hand off your pedal of time
[1:10:24] brother Greg sent me a message he said
[1:10:26] he's already in an overtime mode
[1:10:29] in other words
[1:10:31] amen
[1:10:35] let's go to verse one if you're there
[1:10:37] you can say Amen
[1:10:40] and I stood upon the sand of the sea
[1:10:43] and I saw a beast rising up out of the
[1:10:45] sea having seven horns seven heads and
[1:10:49] how many horns ten horns this Beast do
[1:10:52] we know him
[1:10:54] it's a mixture of the three beasts from
[1:10:56] Daniel
[1:10:57] it's a mixture of a lion
[1:11:00] and a bear
[1:11:02] and a leopard anybody okay and his
[1:11:06] characteristic is seven heads
[1:11:13] and ten horns
[1:11:16] he loves number seven and number 10.
[1:11:20] [Music]
[1:11:22] this that was quick somebody figured
[1:11:25] that out
[1:11:26] amen
[1:11:30] yes sir
[1:11:34] that Beast Within him has a seven and a
[1:11:39] ten
[1:11:39] amen
[1:11:41] so for you to master that Beast you need
[1:11:44] a seven
[1:11:45] and a 10. so when you coming with your
[1:11:48] seven and ten you hook ten here you hook
[1:11:52] seven then you begin to maneuver that
[1:11:54] Beast
[1:11:57] amen
[1:12:02] why did that happen in Revelation 10 7.
[1:12:11] and upon his head the name of water
[1:12:15] when you home during your week spend
[1:12:18] time listening to the message certain
[1:12:19] time reading the Bible you won't get
[1:12:21] lost
[1:12:24] and you will see whatever you listen you
[1:12:25] come here and comes from the pope you'll
[1:12:28] be amazed like wow
[1:12:30] because your boss is telling you I was
[1:12:32] there listening with you now since you
[1:12:34] didn't understand this portion let me
[1:12:36] confirm it to you

[1:12:42] was right to a leopard it's there and
[1:12:44] his feet was as the feet of water bear a
[1:12:48] beast usually like uh like that kind of
[1:12:51] beast when he fight what does he use to
[1:12:53] fight with
[1:12:56] but the feet are there
[1:13:00] so you need a bear to get them
[1:13:04] the bear and the bear must must fight
[1:13:08] we okay
[1:13:09] that's why they bear me to get him
[1:13:12] we okay
[1:13:13] and his mouth as the mouth of a lion
[1:13:16] Babylonian and the dragon which is Satan
[1:13:19] the old serpent gave him power and he

[1:13:26] the devil
[1:13:28] everybody care because whatever he's
[1:13:30] doing he got everything from Satan amen

[1:13:42] to Roman pepper pepper and his deadly
[1:13:45] wound was healed and all the world did
[1:13:48] water wondered so the world will wander
[1:13:52] after this Beast
[1:13:53] the whole world will wander

[1:14:05] dragon which gave power to the Beast and
[1:14:09] the worship to be saying who's like to

[1:16:48] and to blaspheme his name
[1:16:51] and his Tabernacle The Dwelling Place of

[1:20:30] come on
[1:20:32] 17 verse 1. and there came one of the
[1:20:36] Seven Angels which had the seven vows
[1:20:39] everybody okay
[1:20:43] and talk with me
[1:20:46] saying to me come here
[1:20:48] I will show you the Judgment of the
[1:20:51] great whole
[1:20:52] that sits upon water many Waters so the
[1:20:56] one who is calling John
[1:20:58] is the Angel one of the angels that have
[1:21:03] the seven vows
[1:21:05] everybody okay in a hotel we preach
[1:21:08] about this and we found out that this
[1:21:10] Angel was nobody else
[1:21:13] but the angel personal that worked with
[1:21:17] brother Branham
[1:21:19] everybody okay this Angel was nobody
[1:21:22] else but brother Branham
[1:21:25] everybody okay if you have a problem
[1:21:27] it's on YouTube you need to go listen to
[1:21:30] it you get your Bible you got all the
[1:21:32] scripture amen so this Angel ever
[1:21:36] because every Angel Ever every messenger
[1:21:40] have a message of Deliverance and they
[1:21:43] also have a message for judgment
[1:21:46] amen they send the message of
[1:21:48] Deliverance first the children of God
[1:21:50] pick it up and whoever rejected The Vow
[1:21:54] come back and poor and judgment struck
[1:21:56] them amen and this one have the seventh
[1:21:59] vow and he is the one that is calling
[1:22:03] John to show him the judgment
[1:22:06] of God upon the whole
[1:22:08] everybody okay so far
[1:22:10] glory to God
[1:22:12] verse 2. with whom the kings of the
[1:22:16] Earth have committed fornication
[1:22:19] with this woman and the inhabitant of
[1:22:22] the Earth has made has been made drunk
[1:22:25] with the one you remember this of her
[1:22:27] fornication
[1:22:29] because everybody that got this this one
[1:22:32] get mad it's in the Old Testament if you
[1:22:34] remember Isaiah that's what happened to
[1:22:36] belchazza he took the wine of Babylon he
[1:22:39] got crazy he stopped playing with the
[1:22:41] stuff in the temple if somebody doesn't
[1:22:43] respect what is going on in the church
[1:22:45] you must have been drinking from Babylon
[1:22:48] everybody okay
[1:22:50] foreign
[1:22:55] because only The Madness of Babylon
[1:22:57] brother Branham say a fool will walk
[1:23:01] where angel don't even want to step
[1:23:03] there
[1:23:05] in other words if you don't discern the
[1:23:07] presence of God in this church
[1:23:10] you will continue to behave the way you
[1:23:12] behave and you're gonna get hurt
[1:23:16] because you're drinking from Babylon
[1:23:20] everybody okay so he carried me away in
[1:23:24] the spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw
[1:23:28] a woman
[1:23:29] sit upon a scarlet color Beast he was
[1:23:33] spoken that she's sitting on the water
[1:23:35] but she's actually sitting on the Beast
[1:23:37] and the Beast came up from the water in
[1:23:39] other words the woman and the beasts are
[1:23:42] joined together they are one
[1:23:45] that's why the Bible says she sat on the
[1:23:47] water but when you look under her he's a
[1:23:50] beast
[1:23:51] so she is the wife of the false prophet
[1:23:54] that's what brother Branham say and the
[1:23:56] one and the man the the husband and the
[1:23:59] wife are that's why the Bible said that
[1:24:01] the woman sit upon many water the same
[1:24:04] as the Beast sit upon many water
[1:24:06] everybody okay praise God he said full
[1:24:10] of names of blasphemy having seven heads
[1:24:13] and how many horns it's over there
[1:24:16] now follow me carefully job to verse 6.
[1:24:21] and I saw the woman drunken with the
[1:24:25] blood of the sand
[1:24:27] we send that this Beast here is a killer
[1:24:31] and kills the center so whatever the
[1:24:34] Beast is doing the woman is doing it
[1:24:35] they're one person
[1:24:37] everybody okay
[1:24:39] with the blood of the sin and with the
[1:24:41] blood of the Morty of Jesus
[1:24:44] so this is after the crucifixion
[1:24:46] and when I saw her I wonder with great
[1:24:50] admiration
[1:24:52] and the angel said to me wherefore did
[1:24:54] you Marvel in other words what do you
[1:24:56] wonder
[1:24:57] I would tell you the mystery of the
[1:24:59] woman
[1:25:01] and of the beasts that carry her
[1:25:03] remember the devil coupled together with
[1:25:06] Eve together the woman and the Beast
[1:25:08] amen
[1:25:09] and I will tell you the mystery of the
[1:25:12] woman and the Beast that carry him
[1:25:15] which has seven heads and water so this
[1:25:19] Beast here is joined to a woman
[1:25:24] and a woman we know is a church
[1:25:27] anybody okay this church is drunk with
[1:25:31] the blood of the scent which we know
[1:25:33] it's a Catholic church we already went
[1:25:35] through that yes
[1:25:36] verse 8 follow now
[1:25:38] the Beast that you saw was
[1:25:43] everybody okay and he's not
[1:25:47] and shall Ascend out of the bottomless
[1:25:49] feet
[1:25:51] and go into water tradition
[1:25:54] remember this beast in Revelation 13
[1:25:57] have the number of Amen
[1:26:01] 666. so in other words it's a man
[1:26:04] carrying a woman
[1:26:07] a week okay are we okay are we okay
[1:26:12] praise God
[1:26:14] he says and they that dwell let's go to
[1:26:17] verse 8 the Beast that you saw was and
[1:26:20] he's not and shall Ascend out of the
[1:26:23] bottomless pit which is hell in other
[1:26:25] words the pope from origin comes
[1:26:29] straight from hell
[1:26:32] amen
[1:26:37] don't worry
[1:26:39] continue to love your pope amen
[1:26:42] and they shall do and they that dwell on
[1:26:46] the Earth shall do what
[1:26:50] my brother Wonder
[1:26:54] if you notice this Beast here
[1:26:57] they that were on the earth were doing
[1:26:59] what
[1:27:00] wondering everybody okay shall Wonder
[1:27:04] whose name were not written in the Book
[1:27:08] of Life from the foundation of the world
[1:27:10] when they behold they beat that Rose and
[1:27:14] is not and yet it is everybody okay this
[1:27:18] is a repetition of Revelation 13. in
[1:27:22] other words Revelation 17 is telling you
[1:27:26] that this Beast have seven heads and ten
[1:27:29] horn it's exactly the same description
[1:27:32] of the Beast that was in Revelation 13.
[1:27:34] everybody okay
[1:27:36] job to verse 9. and here is the mind
[1:27:39] which has water wisdom the seven heads
[1:27:44] are seven mountains on which the woman
[1:27:47] does Waters so we already found out that
[1:27:50] the seven heads
[1:27:53] number one there are seven mountains
[1:27:56] we went through this the two seven
[1:27:59] mountains we also have seven mountains
[1:28:03] anybody okay so we know how to match him
[1:28:05] we got a seven we got a ten we got
[1:28:09] Mountain so we're matching every plant
[1:28:12] every outlet that the Beast has we are
[1:28:16] plugging them up
[1:28:18] you have seven we got seven you got ten
[1:28:21] we got ten you got seven months and we
[1:28:23] also got seven mountains so we plug in
[1:28:26] the Beast everywhere
[1:28:27] [Music]
[1:28:30] because the Beast is filled with the
[1:28:33] Devil and we got the definition when you
[1:28:37] bring Seven Mountains we got seven
[1:28:39] mountains when you bring ten we got ten
[1:28:42] you bring seven we got seven so this
[1:28:45] message is a full package
[1:28:49] full coverage
[1:28:53] everybody okay
[1:28:55] if you see something coming up you don't
[1:28:58] know how to deal with it just know it's
[1:29:00] them
[1:29:02] even if you have not seen it yet it's
[1:29:05] there you're gonna see an emergency
[1:29:07] bullet
[1:29:11] another word whatever the devil displays
[1:29:16] to you is a signal to you that you have
[1:29:20] it already
[1:29:22] did you understand me
[1:29:24] do you understand what I'm saying if the
[1:29:26] devil say hey just know in your luggage

[1:29:39] already have water in you
[1:29:44] because there is a deep that will come
[1:29:47] to the deeper
[1:29:49] it doesn't happen by any chance
[1:29:53] you already have it you are not just
[1:29:56] aware of it and the trial you going
[1:29:59] through is just a way for God to reveal
[1:30:02] what you have already knew so you can
[1:30:05] wake up
[1:30:08] [Applause]
[1:30:09] the disciple had Jesus in the boat and
[1:30:14] Jesus was sleeping and they were trying
[1:30:16] to solve the problem their problem was
[1:30:19] to tell them God awake Jesus Christ God

[1:30:52] what is behind this trial I'm not the
[1:30:55] devil that's an attack like that
[1:30:57] if you are attacking me there must be
[1:31:01] something going on what are you hiding
[1:31:03] behind what are you trying to teach me
[1:31:09] why didn't that trial happen yes here
[1:31:13] only this year
[1:31:25] have you seen somebody playing with your
[1:31:27] husband's sister
[1:31:30] huh and do you know what you feel in
[1:31:33] your heart you didn't know that thing
[1:31:35] was there until somebody play with your
[1:31:37] husband
[1:31:39] then you just like
[1:31:43] the Holy Ghost have to come quickly
[1:31:48] hey everybody okay because that thing
[1:31:51] was there he was laying dormant
[1:31:56] the challenges bring it out
[1:32:02] [Music]
[1:32:05] [Laughter]
[1:32:09] you taking my time by pulling me
[1:32:11] sideways
[1:32:12] I'm trying to stay on the main line
[1:32:14] everybody okay
[1:32:17] jump to verse 9 and here is the man
[1:32:21] which have wisdom the seven heads
[1:32:24] when Kamala came Indian
[1:32:27] Biden
[1:32:29] Irish brother Branham was Irish and
[1:32:33] Indian together so everything we keep
[1:32:35] plugging
[1:32:37] [Music]
[1:32:41] do you think it happened just like that
[1:32:45] everybody care
[1:32:47] the Bible says the seven heads are seven
[1:32:50] mountains which the woman sits watch now
[1:32:54] and they are also authors 17. so there's
[1:32:58] seven there is a compound meaning here
[1:33:02] anybody here if you stuck with the
[1:33:05] mountain you're gonna lose something
[1:33:07] the seven represented one the seven
[1:33:10] Mountain which we already know the two
[1:33:14] irrepresented seven Kings
[1:33:18] we okay now we already dealt with this
[1:33:20] one if you miss it you go back
[1:33:23] amen
[1:33:24] and they send their seven Kings
[1:33:27] Farms are Fallen
[1:33:29] and one is
[1:33:32] so it's number six and the other is not
[1:33:36] yet come number seven and when he comes
[1:33:39] he must continue a water short space so
[1:33:42] definitely we are dealing with seven
[1:33:45] natural Kings
[1:33:48] for the natural Kingdom of Rome
[1:33:52] everybody okay watch now carefully
[1:33:56] verse 11. you there
[1:33:59] and the Beast
[1:34:01] that have seven heads and ten horns that
[1:34:05] is six six
[1:34:07] that the whole world wander after the
[1:34:10] beasts follow me
[1:34:12] are the beasts that was
[1:34:16] and is not
[1:34:17] even he is the water so the Beast is
[1:34:21] also a king
[1:34:25] is it okay
[1:34:27] is it okay
[1:34:28] the beach they have seven heads
[1:34:32] the seven heads are Kings
[1:34:34] but the beasts himself is also a king he
[1:34:39] is number eight
[1:34:44] the Beast is the eighth King
[1:34:48] everybody here
[1:34:49] everybody okay
[1:34:50] he's the eighth King
[1:34:53] and he's off the water
[1:34:56] yeah
[1:34:59] what are you saying brother Stephen the
[1:35:02] Bible says that they are seven Kings
[1:35:06] amen but surely they are eight King
[1:35:11] everybody okay when you look it's seven
[1:35:14] Kings
[1:35:15] but they base himself is a king
[1:35:18] but the Beast being a king he's the
[1:35:22] eighth King but he's part of the seven
[1:35:27] that's why I told you buckle up
[1:35:30] what are you trying to say brother
[1:35:32] Stephen
[1:35:34] brother Branham brother Branham say five
[1:35:37] Kings which is which was
[1:35:41] Fallen five Kings if you want that from
[1:35:44] the history I shall show it to you in
[1:35:47] other words this King existed
[1:35:50] brother Branham even gave name but I
[1:35:53] don't want to go to that detail
[1:35:55] if you need it you see me
[1:35:57] later on I can give you the detail
[1:35:59] brother Barnum said if you want
[1:36:02] from that that from the history as I
[1:36:05] show it to you and you also if you want
[1:36:07] you see me I will show you the quote
[1:36:11] and one is and one to come now watch the
[1:36:16] Beast now the Beast was not a king
[1:36:19] follow me carefully
[1:36:21] he was one which is which is not and yet
[1:36:26] he is and is not yet he is and is not
[1:36:29] what is it
[1:36:33] a succession of water hopes so right
[1:36:37] here we are moving from Pagan room
[1:36:42] everybody okay
[1:36:44] into a paper room
[1:36:48] did I lost anybody
[1:36:50] did I lost anybody
[1:36:52] glory to God
[1:36:54] he says succession of the Pope a power
[1:36:57] Abyss ruling that is when Pagan Rome was
[1:37:02] converted to make water Apple room Pig
[1:37:06] and rum was converted and then it became
[1:37:09] the papacy which they had the Pope in
[1:37:13] the stead of the king and the pop is a
[1:37:16] water spiritual King so these were
[1:37:19] natural King
[1:37:21] you have to go see them you need the
[1:37:24] node yes you you will bypass God and
[1:37:27] everything but the purple normally Italy
[1:37:31] has like wherever have a president but
[1:37:34] the pope is not the president yet the
[1:37:36] prop is a president
[1:37:38] everybody here but he's not a natural
[1:37:41] president he's a spiritual King
[1:37:47] everybody care why because we move from
[1:37:51] the natural Kingdom into a spiritual
[1:37:54] Kingdom Babylon is no more Babylon
[1:37:57] naturally it is a spiritual Babylon
[1:38:00] which is the woman mystery Babylon
[1:38:04] everybody okay
[1:38:06] glory to God brother Branham said that
[1:38:09] is the reason he's what they're putting
[1:38:11] a crown on the Pope the pope has a crime
[1:38:13] he's a spiritual King everybody okay
[1:38:16] spiritual King claim to be the waters
[1:38:19] welcome the fight Jesus which is the
[1:38:23] replacement of Jesus Christ
[1:38:25] everybody okay
[1:38:27] where are you going brother Stephen

[1:45:59] which is the woman called Jezebel
[1:46:01] everybody clear so far now when God
[1:46:05] promised to do that we have to detect
[1:46:08] where is Babylon
[1:46:10] we found out that Babylon was in those
[1:46:13] two beasts because the Devil incarnated
[1:46:17] Himself in Revelation 13 in the first
[1:46:19] business day
[1:46:21] then we found later on in Revelation 13
[1:46:24] that there is another Beast America
[1:46:26] which at the beginning started very good
[1:46:29] like a lamb but after a while America
[1:46:31] turned into speaking like the dragon in

[1:50:35] prophecy to destroy the Beast Russia
[1:50:38] will destroy birth of this Beast he will
[1:50:40] drop an atomic bomb in Rome and drop an
[1:50:43] atomic bomb in America but this Russia
[1:50:46] that is destroying this Beast is not a
[1:50:49] Christian Russia
[1:50:51] remember last week
[1:50:53] amen Russia have two Spirits it is not
[1:50:56] the realm of Russia but it is the bear
[1:50:59] and the bear is atheistic

[1:59:33] [Music]
[1:59:36] Church
[1:59:46] he says before any battle can be put
[1:59:50] anyway
[1:59:51] they first have to find the water
[1:59:53] leading ground or a water place I have
[1:59:57] wet the water have to be watered it must
[2:00:00] be a water selected because originally
[2:00:03] the battle started at the location
[2:00:07] [Music]
[2:00:08] amen so if we need to finish the battle
[2:00:11] we must find the location where we and
[2:00:14] Lucifer have to meet
[2:00:18] everybody okay Amen brother Branham says
[2:00:21] like when Israel went to war with the
[2:00:23] Philistine there was a hill on each side
[2:00:25] where they gathered and that is where
[2:00:27] Goliath came out and called to the army
[2:00:30] of Israel that is where David met him in
[2:00:33] the water so Israel over there
[2:00:37] Phil is staying over there bring a
[2:00:39] champion so Goliath came down and the
[2:00:42] other came down so we all so must find
[2:00:45] the place
[2:00:46] well we gonna drop down and say Lucifer
[2:00:49] let's meet now
[2:00:52] everybody okay
[2:00:54] God of Adam say there has to be a
[2:00:57] personality
[2:00:58] there has to be a water neutral ground
[2:01:00] and no mainland
[2:01:03] they fight here at this place they just
[2:01:05] don't one fight here in one day and one
[2:01:08] run of it there has a Battlefront where
[2:01:11] they meet and they do what just the
[2:01:13] powers
[2:01:17] when I was in heaven I was not a human
[2:01:20] being yet
[2:01:22] I fought Lucifer as a spirit
[2:01:25] now now I become human being I bypass my
[2:01:30] theophany I need to go back with Matthew
[2:01:34] then I need to fight Lucifer to test
[2:01:37] Lucifer again when I'm a human being
[2:01:40] [Music]
[2:01:40] [Applause]
[2:01:41] [Music]
[2:01:44] in other words Lucifer I fought you when
[2:01:47] I was his Spirit now I might fight you
[2:01:50] when I am human amen
[2:01:53] let this stop power again
[2:01:55] [Applause]
[2:02:03] my God he says when they test their
[2:02:06] power
[2:02:07] where each Army do after strange and
[2:02:11] guess what another and maybe water
[2:02:15] because when the father start here it
[2:02:17] was physical
[2:02:19] when we get to the Earth to human being
[2:02:21] he became on inside because what brother
[2:02:24] Branham saying that when this great

[2:08:26] [Music]
[2:08:28] can I continue
[2:08:30] oh I wish I have three hours buddy
[2:08:38] let's go to verse 15.
[2:08:42] I'll come as a water
[2:08:48] when God is talking about Armageddon he
[2:08:51] bringing his coming as a thief
[2:08:54] [Music]
[2:08:55] they're coming as a fifth is in the age
[2:08:58] of Luther
[2:09:00] God said I will come as a thief he
[2:09:03] promised that in it let's continue
[2:09:06] if blessed is he that what watches and
[2:09:11] keep his water damn it lest he walk how
[2:09:14] naked and the sea water which age did
[2:09:18] God spoke about nakedness
[2:09:22] so this prophecy this battle belonged to
[2:09:25] the people that are going to which age
[2:09:27] [Music]
[2:09:30] everybody okay
[2:09:32] everybody okay so this prophecy have to
[2:09:35] happen when God is emphasizing about
[2:09:38] being close so that your nakedness
[2:09:41] doesn't show up so it goes a prophecy
[2:09:44] that goes towards
[2:09:46] you need Scripture you see me I'm trying
[2:09:48] to skip that
[2:09:50] job 2 verse 16 and he gathered them
[2:09:54] together in a place called in Hebrew
[2:09:58] tongue water
[2:10:00] everybody okay now
[2:10:02] everybody okay now
[2:10:04] watch what happened
[2:10:06] and the Seven Angels
[2:10:09] he never pour His Valiant he was keeping
[2:10:12] his vow until everybody get to him again
[2:10:16] and the Seven Angel make sure you watch
[2:10:18] your scripture
[2:10:20] pull out his vow into the air
[2:10:23] everybody here whenever Bobby is John
[2:10:25] together then he prays Val in other
[2:10:29] words he anointed the place
[2:10:31] so the battle can be really yummy
[2:10:34] everybody okay Indian and there came a
[2:10:38] great voice out of the Temple
[2:10:40] amen from the throne saying it is what
[2:10:43] done
[2:10:45] and then were voices
[2:10:50] let me drop down quickly to to verse uh
[2:10:53] 18. uh let's go to 18. and there were
[2:10:56] voices and Thunder's enlightening and
[2:10:58] there was a great water earthquake such
[2:11:01] as was not seen what was not cease men
[2:11:05] were upon the Earth somebody an
[2:11:07] earthquake and so great and the great
[2:11:10] city was water divided into how many
[2:11:12] particles three parts and the City of
[2:11:14] the nation fell and great Babylon came
[2:11:17] to remembrance before God to give her
[2:11:20] the cup
[2:11:22] of the wine of the fairness of his wife
[2:11:26] and every answer every island fled away
[2:11:30] and the mountain were not fun and they
[2:11:33] fell upon men a great hell out of Heaven
[2:11:36] every stone about the weight of a talent
[2:11:39] 100 pound and Men blasphemed God because
[2:11:43] of the plague of the hell for the plague
[2:11:46] thereof was what exceeding what great
[2:11:49] everybody okay
[2:11:51] what are you trying to say here
[2:11:55] what are you trying to say here now we
[2:11:58] found out by the scripture that
[2:12:00] Armageddon is also a specific place
[2:12:05] amen it's a place also it's a location
[2:12:09] and the battle is going to be physical
[2:12:13] because the battle that started started
[2:12:16] physical he have to end up physical
[2:12:19] everybody okay
[2:12:21] brother Branham says this that now we
[2:12:24] found out that the angel poured out his
[2:12:27] vowel upon the Euphrates even and dried
[2:12:29] up that the king of water
[2:12:34] where did Brother Branham get the King
[2:12:35] of the North
[2:12:37] the Bible said the Kings
[2:12:40] of the East brother Branham said the
[2:12:42] King of the North
[2:12:44] let me just put it there
[2:12:47] the King of the North and brother
[2:12:50] Branham came who is the King of the
[2:12:52] North today Russia
[2:12:56] by the battle continue he said I think
[2:12:59] what that will actually be will be at
[2:13:03] the end time when they come into water
[2:13:05] Armageddon they have to come run down
[2:13:08] through what Egypt
[2:13:11] how can Russia come to Egypt
[2:13:15] he likes they have to come through Egypt
[2:13:20] but the Bible say they also have to
[2:13:22] cross water Euphrates relax brother
[2:13:25] brother said write down through them
[2:13:28] countries they shall have to cross the
[2:13:30] water to get in water so somehow there
[2:13:34] will be people crossing Euphrates and
[2:13:37] some will come from the way of Egypt
[2:13:40] all coming to the battle of Armageddon
[2:13:42] where is that place Armageddon where is
[2:13:45] it
[2:13:48] happy man
[2:13:49] everybody okay brother Brandon say now
[2:13:53] then you Freight this evil is made is is
[2:13:57] when this made way for it to come down
[2:14:00] see making way for the king of the north
[2:14:02] to come down the water you see now
[2:14:05] brother Bradham goes to plural so in
[2:14:07] other words brother brother me selling
[2:14:09] you that among these Kings
[2:14:12] one of the king is the King of the North
[2:14:16] to Russia we okay now and that shall
[2:14:19] take place during that time of the
[2:14:22] battle of Armageddon in the water last
[2:14:25] days glory to God
[2:14:27] brother Branham from the four corners of
[2:14:30] the earth they gathered them gathered
[2:14:33] them to water Armageddon gather them
[2:14:35] together to the great day of the battle
[2:14:37] of the Lord now on this mixed color
[2:14:40] which is the Pale Horse wibbly Pearl
[2:14:44] siglos just think of it you know that is
[2:14:47] a bad thing now watch where he gathered
[2:14:49] them from the four corners of the earth
[2:14:52] they are gathering now for the water
[2:14:54] Showdown The Showdown will be a water
[2:14:57] Armageddon so Armageddon is not only a
[2:15:01] capping not only a finishing not only a
[2:15:06] fulfilling not only an ending but he's
[2:15:10] so sorry shutdown we gotta finish the
[2:15:13] deal they are finished mother

[2:15:20] everybody okay everybody okay now this
[2:15:24] battle in heaven starting a specific
[2:15:27] place a specific location on the earth a
[2:15:31] specific place a specific location call
[2:15:34] Armageddon but where is Armageddon
[2:15:39] brother
[2:15:41] the Bible says in Hebrew chapter 12 that
[2:15:45] by year come on to water Mount Zion and
[2:15:48] to the city of water the water Heavenly
[2:15:52] Jerusalem to an innumerable company of
[2:15:55] what angels
[2:15:57] then it's not not just heaven
[2:16:06] and that seed in heaven is called
[2:16:09] Jerusalem
[2:16:16] this is where you got Angels everybody
[2:16:18] okay
[2:16:20] do the general assembly of the Church of
[2:16:23] the water so that's why you were in in
[2:16:25] heaven
[2:16:27] your church didn't start here you were
[2:16:29] already in church in heaven in Jerusalem
[2:16:32] amen which are written well in heaven
[2:16:35] before the foundation of the world and
[2:16:37] to God the judge of all and to the
[2:16:40] spirit of just men made perfect brother
[2:16:42] pranam say in the scripture we got a
[2:16:46] Jerusalem
[2:16:47] the church has it is in heaven a
[2:16:51] Heavenly water Jerusalem where who God
[2:16:54] is God Lucifer started the battle
[2:16:58] in heaven and in heaven the battle
[2:17:01] started when Jerusalem was
[2:17:05] [Music]
[2:17:07] everybody okay if prophecy repeated
[2:17:11] itself
[2:17:12] everybody okay
[2:17:14] everybody okay if history resolve itself
[2:17:18] so if this battle must be also fought we
[2:17:23] must save this battle in the place
[2:17:26] called Jerusalem
[2:17:28] [Music]
[2:17:29] foreign
[2:17:32] that's a deduction chill out
[2:17:37] everybody okay
[2:17:39] the Bible say in Revelation 20.
[2:17:43] everybody okay
[2:17:44] the Bible say when the Thousand Years
[2:17:47] expired
[2:17:49] this is after 1000 years
[2:17:52] follow me carefully
[2:17:54] after 1000 years
[2:17:57] Satan shall be loose out of his prison
[2:17:59] everybody okay and he shall go out and
[2:18:03] do water
[2:18:04] relation which are in the four corners
[2:18:07] of water yes
[2:18:08] to water God and Magog
[2:18:11] after a thousand years we found a place
[2:18:15] also called Gog and Magog
[2:18:25] so there is another battle
[2:18:27] call what
[2:18:28] the dog and Magog
[2:18:31] so we got a battle called Armageddon we
[2:18:34] got a battle called go again what is
[2:18:36] going on between Armageddon and gargant
[2:18:39] Magog
[2:18:41] brother the Bible say to gather them to
[2:18:44] the battle the number of whom is as the
[2:18:47] sand of water
[2:18:49] if this battle is again the devil
[2:18:52] recruiting people to fight against God
[2:18:55] this battle must be also in a specific
[2:18:59] location
[2:19:05] if the first battle
[2:19:08] happened in Jerusalem and we are
[2:19:10] supposing that Armageddon happened in
[2:19:14] Jerusalem so go again Magog by prophecy
[2:19:18] being revolved must also happen in
[2:19:21] Jerusalem
[2:19:23] the Bible says and they went up on the
[2:19:27] breath of the earth and compassed the
[2:19:30] camp of descent about the water
[2:19:33] what is the Beloved city called
[2:19:35] Jerusalem so God get my God happen in
[2:19:39] Jerusalem
[2:19:44] the greatest battle the first father in
[2:19:47] Jerusalem where is Armageddon happening
[2:19:52] everybody okay
[2:19:53] and then fire came down from God out of
[2:19:57] heaven and devoured them follow me
[2:19:59] carefully and the devil that deceived
[2:20:03] them was cast into the water you
[2:20:05] remember the Lake of Fire the second
[2:20:07] death and brimstone where the water
[2:20:10] Beast and the water false prophet stop
[2:20:13] so when the devil is entering the Lake
[2:20:16] of Fire he sees the Beast and the false
[2:20:19] prophet how did the Beast and the first
[2:20:23] prophet got there
[2:20:26] we okay because the lake of fire if you
[2:20:28] remember is the second death it destroys
[2:20:31] the souls and the spirit so that they
[2:20:33] vanish forever so we won't have any more
[2:20:36] Devils any more demon amen when they
[2:20:39] take the devil they put him into the
[2:20:41] Lake of Fire
[2:20:42] the Father the devil when he entered
[2:20:45] there he sees the Beast
[2:20:47] and the false prophet oh the Trinity of
[2:20:51] the devil is the Devil Himself the Beast
[2:20:55] and the false prophet so we found here
[2:20:58] that God get Magog will finish Satan
[2:21:03] tonight hey everybody here but we got
[2:21:07] the Beast and the false prophet but when
[2:21:10] the devil entered the Lake of Fire he
[2:21:13] seen the Beast and the false prophet the
[2:21:16] devil got into the Lake of Fire after a
[2:21:19] battle
[2:21:21] we fought in Gog in Magog after the
[2:21:25] battle we put him in the Lake of Fire
[2:21:27] but when he entered there he sees the
[2:21:30] Beast and the false prophet so how did
[2:21:33] they get there so there must be a battle
[2:21:37] everybody okay that pick the Beast and
[2:21:41] the first prophet and put them so there
[2:21:44] is a battle before God Magog
[2:21:48] that is gonna take the Beast and the
[2:21:51] first prophet and put them in the Lake
[2:21:54] of Fire then go get my God would take
[2:21:57] the devil and put him in the Lake of
[2:21:59] Fire so the X battle
[2:22:06] are two separate battles
[2:22:10] any question
[2:22:12] William Marion brother will you please
[2:22:15] explain how Satan is Born the Thousand
[2:22:17] Year being loose again for the battle in
[2:22:20] Revelation 20. you there
[2:22:23] that is not the Battle of water
[2:22:26] Armageddon
[2:22:27] everybody okay everybody okay amen you
[2:22:31] see how brother Branham is scripture
[2:22:32] that is not the battle of Armageddon the
[2:22:35] battle of Armageddon take place oh
[2:22:39] all right when the tribulation period
[2:22:42] has water indeed
[2:22:44] I love the message
[2:22:47] now what relation does this have with
[2:22:50] the Battle of water
[2:22:52] how many relations no
[2:22:54] [Music]
[2:22:55] no
[2:22:56] so it is still separate battle
[2:23:00] the Battle of God in my God the chief
[2:23:03] prisoner is the devil we take him
[2:23:07] Rectify but when we put him in the Lake
[2:23:10] of Fire two prisoners are already there
[2:23:13] how did they get there if they if the
[2:23:17] devil got there after a battle there
[2:23:20] must be a battle that took the false
[2:23:22] prophet and the Beast and put them into
[2:23:25] a prison everybody okay
[2:23:28] one is the Thousand Year on the other
[2:23:31] side and the other one is the end of the
[2:23:34] water Thousand Years the one is before
[2:23:36] the thousand years is Armageddon and the
[2:23:39] one after the thousand years is
[2:23:41] because it's taking care of the Trinity
[2:23:44] of the devil
[2:23:45] everybody okay
[2:23:46] now as mentioned in the fourth seal will
[2:23:50] God get mad dog be gathered from people
[2:23:52] of the new Earth Satan was lose out of
[2:23:54] the prison and went to gather the people
[2:23:56] the wicked and bring them to this place
[2:23:58] and God Ran fire and brimstone out of
[2:24:01] heaven and they were consumed see it is
[2:24:03] water
[2:24:03] [Music]

[2:44:41] we can go to the airport why do they
[2:44:45] burn them why do they eat their flesh
[2:44:48] why is blood coming up because we're
[2:44:51] dealing with Jezebel and since history
[2:44:54] repeats itself we must see how did
[2:44:58] Jezebel die in the Old Testament
[2:45:03] can I continue can I continue
[2:45:07] brother Branham say after death the dead
[2:45:11] body
[2:45:12] where he started he said in second king
[2:45:15] throw her down Jezebel so they threw her
[2:45:18] down and some of her blood was sprinkled
[2:45:23] to the world and on the water the blood
[2:45:26] of Jezebel went to the horses if we
[2:45:30] coming on Armageddon we all will deal
[2:45:33] with Jezebel the blood of the people
[2:45:36] must touch our horse
[2:45:39] because history
[2:45:41] prophecy
[2:45:43] he beats itself
[2:45:45] everybody okay
[2:45:47] he said and he showed her on the water
[2:45:50] remember the trotting on the foot and
[2:45:53] when he was coming he did eat and drink
[2:45:56] jihu and say go now go see now this
[2:46:00] cursed woman and bury her for she is the
[2:46:04] king donor and they went to bury her but
[2:46:06] they found water
[2:46:08] no more of her than what and water and
[2:46:13] water who ate Jezebel
[2:46:16] why is the Angel calling people for the
[2:46:19] beasts he said come and eat the flesh
[2:46:21] because we're dealing with another
[2:46:23] Jezebel somebody must eat human flesh
[2:46:26] wherefore they came again and told him
[2:46:29] he said this is the word of the Lord
[2:46:31] which he spoke by the servant who Elijah
[2:46:34] why does Elijah have to come back in the
[2:46:36] end time because there was a jezebel
[2:46:41] how are you blind
[2:46:45] every time Jezebel come a larger mask
[2:46:49] [Music]
[2:46:52] everybody okay and then the teacher
[2:46:55] saying in the portion of Jesus shall
[2:46:58] water eat the Flesh of who and the
[2:47:01] carcass of Jezebel shall be as water
[2:47:03] upon the face of the field in the person
[2:47:06] or in a portion of water so that he
[2:47:08] shall they shall not say this is who

[2:47:13] let's go quickly after death brother
[2:47:16] brought them say their bodies are
[2:47:18] destroyed by wild beasts you know that
[2:47:21] that is true like this had the type of
[2:47:24] food Jezebel brother Branham explained
[2:47:27] he said they ask him a question explain
[2:47:28] blood on the horse's brother brother
[2:47:31] Branham say Brothers beat the Armageddon
[2:47:34] the Bible predicted that in the last day
[2:47:36] he will trap Catholicism romanism and
[2:47:40] all them communism and all of them
[2:47:42] together in the valley of
[2:47:44] because Armageddon means the valley the
[2:47:46] hill of megido he will get them into a
[2:47:49] megido he get the bear he get the Beast
[2:47:53] he bring all of them in Armageddon there
[2:47:56] until there will be such a Slaughter
[2:47:58] amongst them until the blood will water
[2:48:02] from the horses
[2:48:05] brother everybody okay we are just
[2:48:08] fulfilling prophecy everybody okay
[2:48:10] brother Branham said then I just heard
[2:48:13] you all repeat it over keep your eyes on
[2:48:16] who remember that keep your eyes on who
[2:48:19] she will wind up in water and then it
[2:48:23] all won that finally in water so the
[2:48:26] bear and the beasts are together we work
[2:48:29] together coming back for a fight
[2:48:33] remember it shall all wind up in
[2:48:36] Catholicism in the end time that is
[2:48:39] exactly right I'm gonna zero it into the
[2:48:41] airport I gotta skip some of them amen
[2:48:44] and that is the battle of Armageddon
[2:48:47] right over here when Christ come who
[2:48:49] himself what are you talking about
[2:48:52] brother Stephen we will the prophecy of
[2:48:56] Ezekiel 38 I can go with you through the
[2:48:59] scripture but I'm skipping because of
[2:49:01] time we can do that maybe in the
[2:49:03] question and answer everybody okay will
[2:49:06] the prophecy of Ezekiel 38 and 39 be
[2:49:10] fulfilled before the rapture
[2:49:14] back all up my friend
[2:49:16] back all up my friend
[2:49:22] amen I think not
[2:49:24] I think the next thing we're looking for
[2:49:27] is the rapture of the church then what
[2:49:31] when God get Magog comes down is water
[2:49:38] this God get my God is not the god of my
[2:49:42] God after the millennium
[2:49:44] because prophecy only repeats itself
[2:49:47] everybody okay everybody okay write the
[2:49:51] Army coming down amen will Ezekiel 38
[2:49:54] and turn it down come to pass before the
[2:49:57] rapture
[2:49:58] Ezekiel 38 and 39 deal with whom
[2:50:02] [Music]
[2:50:05] the water because in Ezekiel you're
[2:50:07] gonna see the talking about the not the
[2:50:09] the the King of the North coming up
[2:50:12] amen but after the Millennium everything
[2:50:15] will be killed no Russia nothing we kill
[2:50:18] everything everybody okay
[2:50:20] I do not say that this is correct but to
[2:50:23] my way of teaching it it come to pass
[2:50:25] after the Rapture after the church is
[2:50:28] water God deals with God and my god when
[2:50:31] they come down before Israel
[2:50:34] I have the scripture and think that it
[2:50:37] will come to pass after the water
[2:50:38] Rapture but that is my way of teaching
[2:50:41] it I suppose that is what they want to
[2:50:43] know what Madea was everybody okay what
[2:50:48] are you talking about Daniel is giving
[2:50:51] this assurance of the end of the Gentile
[2:50:54] dispensation when you go home tomorrow
[2:50:56] read Daniel 11.
[2:50:59] you can see how the King of the North is
[2:51:03] coming down which is nothing else but
[2:51:05] water like a water
[2:51:08] and the great battle of Armageddon will
[2:51:12] be fought right there
[2:51:14] near the Gate of water because the first
[2:51:18] battle started where God get mad God
[2:51:21] will Saturn and what do you think
[2:51:24] Armageddon would start where Elijah
[2:51:27] Moses were killed

[2:55:06] shall gradually not gradually but
[2:55:09] rapidly get water
[2:55:11] waste and waste when Russia goes down
[2:55:14] there to get water
[2:55:19] everybody okay look out that is all she
[2:55:23] need that is what the prophet said he
[2:55:26] will do does Israel have oil yes
[2:55:33] Deuteronomy 33 verse 24 and of Usher he
[2:55:37] said let Usher be blessed with children

[2:56:43] the eyes of the Lord their God are
[2:56:46] always upon it from the beginning of the
[2:56:49] year until the water so the land of
[2:56:52] Israel is a Richland
[2:56:55] why are you saying that the material is
[2:56:59] there the Jews will reach then the same
[2:57:03] thing will pollute their Camp again
[2:57:05] they shall come right down the cities of
[2:57:08] the world Russia will come down say well
[2:57:12] just got to have that stuff
[2:57:15] that is what what do you do with uranium
[2:57:19] what do you do with you anymore
[2:57:22] atomic bomb and everything down there we
[2:57:26] got to get that and as they go down then
[2:57:30] we'll be the Battle of water
[2:57:32] that shall be when God will stand like
[2:57:36] he did in the valley for the children of
[2:57:39] Israel and fight again but it shall take
[2:57:42] place
[2:57:43] but that shall take place until the
[2:57:46] gentle dispensation will be watered when
[2:57:50] the time when that time is finished is
[2:57:52] what so we found out that the battle of
[2:57:55] Armageddon that started in heaven and
[2:57:59] that is finishing up on the earth he's
[2:58:02] gonna be fought in Jerusalem and that
[2:58:04] battle evolved Rome
[2:58:08] the Beast involved the false prophet
[2:58:12] involve Russia and not only involve
[2:58:15] those people but the bride that Jesus
[2:58:18] Christ will also feasting on that battle
[2:58:23] everybody okay everybody okay but we
[2:58:27] remember in the Old Testament that we
[2:58:30] have three kingdom
[2:58:32] we have three kingdom we have the
[2:58:36] kingdom of Babylon which was a lion
[2:58:40] we okay we have the Kingdom of Middle
[2:58:43] passion which was a bear
[2:58:46] okay
[2:58:47] be careful I'm dropping to the airport
[2:58:48] we have the kingdom of the leopard which
[2:58:52] was the Greek Empire okay and that was a
[2:58:56] great military servant
[2:58:58] amen all those Kingdom will wind up into
[2:59:01] one which is the Beast of Revelation 30.
[2:59:04] but we found a man by the name of David
[2:59:09] I show you this before I'm gonna make my
[2:59:12] point
[2:59:13] what happened in David David said that
[2:59:16] that servant slope of what
[2:59:19] and what
[2:59:24] everybody okay
[2:59:26] and this uncircumstance what Philistine
[2:59:30] which is a mighty military man it shall
[2:59:33] be as water one of them the Lord that
[2:59:36] deliver me out of the power of water the
[2:59:38] lion out of the power of water will
[2:59:41] deliver me out of the end of water
[2:59:44] and we found out that the first kingdom
[2:59:46] was a lion
[2:59:48] the second was a bear the third was a
[2:59:51] great military man Alexander the Great
[2:59:54] and David killed the lion and he killed
[2:59:57] the bear and the third person he killed
[3:00:00] was a mighty military man by the name of
[3:00:02] Goliath so whatever was happening in the
[3:00:06] life of David was a son to what God
[3:00:10] would do as the son of David
[3:00:13] [Music]
[3:00:16] everybody okay because the Bible says
[3:00:21] that man and present let me freely speak
[3:00:24] unto you of the patriarch Who David here
[3:00:27] but that he was both dead and buried and
[3:00:31] his Sepulcher is with us unto this day
[3:00:33] therefore being a what prophet who was a
[3:00:36] prophet so David was a prophet
[3:00:40] and the prophet is a son
[3:00:44] are you following me so what David the
[3:00:47] prophet is doing naturally it is a son
[3:00:53] of what God will do spiritually down the
[3:00:58] road David killing the lion will stop it
[3:01:02] was typifying Jesus Christ killing
[3:01:06] Babylon
[3:01:09] everybody okay David killing the bear
[3:01:12] was typifying Jesus Christ killing the
[3:01:15] second Kingdom David killing Goliath
[3:01:18] stupefying Jesus Christ killing the
[3:01:21] third Kingdom in other words the three
[3:01:23] killing of David
[3:01:26] spoke of Jesus Christ so a prophet do
[3:01:30] stuff in his life
[3:01:33] everybody okay everybody okay that is a
[3:01:37] message
[3:01:39] amen for what God because they did it
[3:01:43] naturally but now we are the Fulfillment
[3:01:46] now God have to fulfill what David gave
[3:01:50] us a type
[3:01:52] Hallelujah
[3:01:55] why are you saying that
[3:01:58] why are you saying that
[3:02:00] brother Branham say I saw a vision that
[3:02:03] morning
[3:02:07] was why the problem a prophet yes I saw
[3:02:10] a vision that morning and I seen a large
