[52:34] so we don't see foolishness
[52:36] in our receptions
[52:38] okay yeah I don't want to see what I see
[52:41] across the message
[52:45] you already got the word and I'm under
[52:48] commission to deliver the message the
[52:51] way it came from the messenger
[52:54] I'm under commission to repeat what
[52:56] brother Branham say

[53:00] Under The Same Spirit that brother

[53:16] years later you will get the Revelation

[53:22] but I am backing up with what I'm seeing
[53:24] Joshua chapter 1 verse one if you dare
[53:28] you can say Amen let's see how I can
[53:31] navigate through this by God's grace if
[53:34] we can push amen
[53:37] hmm yeah we handle that later
[53:42] now after the death of Moses
[53:47] the servant of the Lord
[53:51] I'm responsible for what I'm going to
[53:53] say
[53:54] this is me
[53:55] okay if somebody say you say that was
[53:58] brother Stephen
[53:59] after the death of William Marion
[54:01] Branham
[54:05] that's me okay
[54:07] you can be part of it or not but that's
[54:10] me okay that's me
[54:13] I'm responsible if somebody have a
[54:15] problem they need to call me
[54:18] now after the death of Moses the servant
[54:22] of the Lord he came to pass that the
[54:25] Lord spoke to Joshua the son of none
[54:29] Moses minister in other words assistant
[54:33] saying everybody clear you might be
[54:36] seated so a major great big Prophet have
[54:41] passed away
[54:44] amen a prophet that God used powerfully
[54:49] in a mighty way
[54:51] because God spoke he says the way I talk
[54:55] with Moses
[54:58] it is not the way I talk to everybody
[55:00] [Applause]
[55:01] he said when I talk to somebody I have
[55:05] to search certain way to talk but when
[55:07] I'm talking to Moses
[55:10] God said do you know the scripture God
[55:12] say I talked to Moses face to face
[55:17] in other words Moses is like my friend
[55:21] when me and Moses talk there is no
[55:24] filter
[55:27] amen
[55:29] Moses who accomplished great miracle in
[55:33] Egypt
[55:34] that Prophet Moses is dead
[55:39] have Moses left something
[55:43] job 2 verse 7.
[55:47] amen
[55:50] now God is talking to Joshua who is left
[55:54] Moses is gone
[55:56] but
[55:59] there is something that Moses left
[56:02] and that which Moses left is not
[56:05] different than Moses
[56:11] the Bible says that Moses is red
[56:15] every Sabbath
[56:17] it's written in the Bible
[56:19] they didn't take the man Moses in
[56:21] reading it
[56:22] everybody okay they were reading the law
[56:25] of Moses because the messenger and his
[56:28] message are water
[56:30] and the same everybody okay
[56:33] you should be chewing this kind of stuff
[56:35] already
[56:38] so we can move to New meals
[56:41] everybody okay
[56:43] only be you strong
[56:46] and very courageous
[56:49] that you may observe
[56:52] to do according to all the law
[56:56] not some law
[56:59] all the law which who
[57:02] Moses must serve and commanded so Moses
[57:06] left the scene as a man but he left a
[57:10] message
[57:12] everybody okay he left the law
[57:16] and God is instructing the minister that
[57:20] was left that what you wanted to do in
[57:24] your life is to follow the message that
[57:27] Moses left
[57:29] why do you have to stay with everything
[57:32] that Moses left
[57:35] what is in it what is he gonna do to you
[57:41] when you follow Moses to the level
[57:46] from Kiefer to Kevin
[57:51] what will happen to you
[57:54] what do you get out of it
[57:57] what is the benefit of it
[57:59] everybody okay
[58:01] glory to God only be that strong and
[58:05] very courageous that you may observe to
[58:08] do according to all the law which Moses
[58:11] my servant commanded you watch this turn
[58:15] not from me to the water
[58:17] or to the water in other words you
[58:20] cannot even joke
[58:23] even a slight no you must stay zero in
[58:28] with Moses what he says Amen in other
[58:31] words if somebody come
[58:34] and want to interpret Moses law
[58:37] a different way than the way Moses
[58:40] delivered
[58:41] don't follow it
[58:44] why
[58:46] comma that you made water Prosper
[58:50] wherever you water go with
[58:55] is my papa different than your Bible sir
[58:57] so if you want to prosper what do you
[58:59] have to do follow Moses
[59:03] how do you follow Moses
[59:05] in detail
[59:14] so the law of Moses
[59:18] or the message of Moses
[59:21] amen have a key to prosperity
[59:33] don't worry
[59:35] amen
[59:37] I say Amen you can refuse it
[59:41] job to verse 8 it's a matter of take or
[59:44] leave it
[59:45] but as for me
[59:48] and my house
[59:50] me I take what God has for me
[59:54] if you fall with the blessing of God
[59:56] praise be to the name of God but I know
[59:58] you not
[1:00:00] verse 18. this book of the Lord this
[1:00:04] message that Moses left
[1:00:06] amen
[1:00:08] shall not depart out of your water now
[1:00:12] not out of your head
[1:00:18] what does it mean shall not depart out
[1:00:21] of your mouth
[1:00:22] does it mean you take the scroll and put
[1:00:25] it in your mouth and everywhere you're
[1:00:27] going you have the scroll
[1:00:34] they're talking about the mouth the law
[1:00:37] of Moses or the message of Moses God
[1:00:42] told Joshua make sure that message is in
[1:00:45] your mouth
[1:00:48] not sometime
[1:00:53] everybody okay any time
[1:00:56] the law of Moses must be in your mouth
[1:00:59] in other words if somebody want to know
[1:01:01] the law of Moses
[1:01:04] they can just talked to Joshua
[1:01:07] because the law of Moses is always on
[1:01:10] the mouth of Joshua
[1:01:14] so when you talk to Joshua
[1:01:17] you won't hear politics
[1:01:23] thank you continue with your politics
[1:01:26] this book of the law
[1:01:28] shall not depart out of your mouth
[1:01:32] but you shall do what meditate therein
[1:01:35] how day and night
[1:01:37] you meditate sometime
[1:01:40] how can you meditate day and night in
[1:01:43] other word all the time
[1:01:46] constantly
[1:01:49] you are thinking about the book of Moses
[1:01:54] when you wake up you start
[1:01:56] all the way when you go to bed you're
[1:01:59] still thinking about what Moses said
[1:02:07] there is a meditation
[1:02:11] amen how dare not all the time
[1:02:16] everybody okay
[1:02:18] that you may observe to water do there
[1:02:23] is a doing
[1:02:27] or action
[1:02:31] amen
[1:02:33] three things
[1:02:36] this book of the law shall not depart
[1:02:38] off your art of your mom so in your
[1:02:41] mouth the law is there
[1:02:43] everybody okay when you meditate you
[1:02:46] meditate upon that law
[1:02:49] when you do you do that law
[1:02:52] so we want to see the law of Moses in
[1:02:55] your mouth
[1:02:57] in your meditation and in your action
[1:03:02] everybody okay the law of Moses must be
[1:03:05] in your mouth
[1:03:07] it must be in your meditation it must be
[1:03:10] in your action
[1:03:11] so when you meditate if God look he must
[1:03:14] see the law
[1:03:16] when you're doing things in your life
[1:03:18] when God look he must see the Lord when
[1:03:21] you are talking when God heal he must
[1:03:23] heal the Lord
[1:03:28] amen why is that that you may observe to
[1:03:33] do according to all that is written
[1:03:36] where
[1:03:38] for then you shall make your way how
[1:03:42] prosperous and then you shall have water
[1:03:46] good success so if you if you want to
[1:03:50] have prosperity
[1:03:52] and good success
[1:03:56] amen you need to make sure the message
[1:03:59] is in your mouth
[1:04:03] and you meditate upon the message
[1:04:06] and you do what the message saying
[1:04:10] amen math we already know what it is but
[1:04:14] where does the meditation comes from
[1:04:20] David says this
[1:04:22] in the book of Psalm verse 19 Chapter 19
[1:04:25] Verse 14. let the water words word of
[1:04:30] water my mouth
[1:04:32] and the meditation of my water all right
[1:04:37] everybody okay
[1:04:40] so when we talk about the math we are
[1:04:43] talking about the words
[1:04:45] and when we talk about the meditation we
[1:04:49] are talking about the heart
[1:04:52] amen
[1:04:53] David say let the word of my mouth and
[1:04:57] the meditation of my heart be how
[1:04:59] acceptable in this in that sight oh Lord
[1:05:03] my strengthen my water Redeemer how is
[1:05:06] your word
[1:05:08] and your meditation be acceptable
[1:05:13] the only way you can be acceptable is if
[1:05:17] you put what God has given you
[1:05:20] because God and His word are one
[1:05:25] if you want to please God make sure your
[1:05:28] mouth has the word of God
[1:05:33] everybody okay make sure nothing come
[1:05:36] out of your mouth
[1:05:38] that will contradict the word of God
[1:05:45] whatever you talk in your mouth make
[1:05:48] sure it doesn't go against the message
[1:05:50] of the hour amen
[1:05:54] whatever you are thinking and pondering
[1:05:57] in your heart must be according to the
[1:05:59] message of the hour amen and whatever
[1:06:02] you do in your life must be according to
[1:06:05] the message of Yahweh
[1:06:07] amazing
[1:06:11] the message is not for month only
[1:06:14] but not life
[1:06:17] Psalm 49 verse 3 my mouth
[1:06:21] shall speak of water wisdom and the
[1:06:24] meditation of my heart shall be of water
[1:06:27] because out of the abundance of the
[1:06:30] water all right that's the water so when
[1:06:33] they're talking about keeping the word
[1:06:35] in the mouth before the word can get in
[1:06:38] The Mask he must first stand in the
[1:06:40] heart
[1:06:42] is that first in the heart then he goes
[1:06:46] in the mouth then he become a living
[1:06:48] action that's right
[1:06:55] number one number two number three
[1:07:00] these are the key to your faith
[1:07:03] everybody okay first it is in the heart
[1:07:07] amen after the heart you speak it when
[1:07:11] you speak you act according to what you
[1:07:14] spoke
[1:07:16] [Music]
[1:07:22] that's fun Roman 10 verse 8 but what
[1:07:26] says there
[1:07:33] so you can never separate the mouth and
[1:07:36] the Heart sorry
[1:07:40] everybody okay everybody okay and Paul
[1:07:44] continue he said that is the word of
[1:07:46] water which we which that if you shall
[1:07:50] do whatever confess with water thy mouth
[1:07:53] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:55] in the heart that God has raised him to
[1:07:58] death then that shall be out same so
[1:08:00] first you must believe in your heart and
[1:08:04] then you must confess it in your mouth
[1:08:07] and God Wants You Always
[1:08:10] to meditate upon his word amen because
[1:08:13] the more you put his word in his in your
[1:08:16] heart the more you have something to
[1:08:19] speak
[1:08:22] whatever entering will come out if you
[1:08:26] don't put anything there there is
[1:08:28] nothing to speak about
[1:08:31] everybody okay
[1:08:33] what is this why is this important
[1:08:37] prosper and have water good success so
[1:08:41] God wants you to prosper amen amen
[1:08:47] God wants you to have good success
[1:08:50] that's right that's why he's giving you
[1:08:52] the key to prosperity
[1:09:04] amen
[1:09:06] amen
[1:09:09] let's go to mark 11.
[1:09:19] it's amazing
[1:09:23] how people are more holy than God
[1:09:33] we got used to religion
[1:09:38] amen
[1:09:39] that's why we suffer
[1:09:41] it's not because of God
[1:09:43] it is because of the way we interpreted
[1:09:46] God the perfect interpretation of God
[1:09:49] came by the message of the hour
[1:09:55] you want to understand God do what
[1:09:57] brother Branham say there it is
[1:10:02] Mark 11 verse 12. if you dare you can
[1:10:05] say Amen
[1:10:07] and on the moral when I will see how I'm
[1:10:10] gonna go when they were come from
[1:10:12] Bethany
[1:10:14] he was hungry you remember this is not a
[1:10:18] spiritual hunger
[1:10:19] this is a natural hunger Jesus needed
[1:10:23] food
[1:10:24] not food for his heart food for his
[1:10:27] belly
[1:10:41] amen
[1:10:43] he says and seeing a fig tree a far off
[1:10:47] having lives he came if perhaps happily
[1:10:52] he must find anything there on and when
[1:10:55] he came to it he found nothing but lives
[1:10:59] for the time of the Fig was not yet you
[1:11:02] remember that right
[1:11:04] it was something that was out of season
[1:11:06] but God wanted to eat
[1:11:10] so his hunger doesn't look at the season
[1:11:19] everybody okay he's not sure he's
[1:11:23] natural
[1:11:25] need
[1:11:27] oh desire
[1:11:29] amen is not based
[1:11:33] on the season
[1:11:37] amen so what mother is not this season
[1:11:41] what mother is if
[1:11:45] if the desires start
[1:11:51] if the desires start and it's the season
[1:11:55] fine
[1:11:56] if it's not the season fine but if the
[1:11:59] desires start
[1:12:00] [Applause]
[1:12:03] there must be something
[1:12:07] if a death already started
[1:12:10] a dip started there must be another deep
[1:12:14] to respond
[1:12:16] don't just study like that
[1:12:21] while you were not worrying about it now
[1:12:24] you start worrying about it
[1:12:28] amen
[1:12:31] amen amen
[1:12:33] because if Jesus would say that this is
[1:12:36] not the season
[1:12:38] I have to wait until the season he will
[1:12:41] die of hunger
[1:12:46] everybody okay
[1:12:48] everybody okay
[1:12:51] if Jesus say okay let me take an example
[1:12:54] maybe this was January and the season
[1:12:57] was December so you want Jesus to wait
[1:12:59] until December with his hunger
[1:13:07] verse 14 and Jesus answered and said to
[1:13:11] him no man eat fruit of you Hereafter
[1:13:15] forever and his disciple heard it jump
[1:13:18] to verse 19.
[1:13:20] and when the evening was come he went
[1:13:23] out of the city and in the morning
[1:13:25] brother Kelly give me more here and in
[1:13:28] the morning as they pass by they saw the
[1:13:31] fig tree dried up from the roots where
[1:13:33] life hides
[1:13:35] and Peter calling to remember and say to
[1:13:38] him Master behold the Fig Tree which you
[1:13:42] cursed is withered away
[1:13:45] and Jesus answering say to them have
[1:13:48] water faith in God
[1:13:52] so everything that happened happened
[1:13:54] because of faith
[1:13:57] we clear right
[1:13:58] I don't know how long I'm gonna linger
[1:14:00] in this channel until we pull the fifth
[1:14:03] out of you
[1:14:06] I know what I'm about to bring some of
[1:14:09] you will struggle to swallow it but I
[1:14:11] will continue to push it
[1:14:12] [Music]
[1:14:13] in other words if I push it you throw it
[1:14:16] away I put it back again
[1:14:19] you have to follow it
[1:14:22] because God didn't send you in this
[1:14:24] church just like that
[1:14:27] [Applause]
[1:14:27] [Music]
[1:14:29] put you under this ministry I will make
[1:14:32] sure you follow it amen amen amen
[1:14:37] oh you should be somewhere else
[1:14:41] but you're gonna swallow it
[1:14:44] even if you refuse I will push it
[1:14:51] amen amen
[1:14:54] verse 23 for verily I say unto you that
[1:14:59] whosoever shall say to other this
[1:15:02] mountain be thou removed and be cast
[1:15:05] into the sea and shall not doubt in the
[1:15:08] water his heart you remember last Sunday
[1:15:10] Amen in the heart but Shall Believe
[1:15:13] remember Paul just say you believe in
[1:15:15] the Heart Right
[1:15:16] amen that's where faith lies amen and
[1:15:20] shall believe that those things which he
[1:15:22] shall come which he shall which he said
[1:15:24] shall come to pass he shall have
[1:15:26] whatsoever he says you understand this
[1:15:29] now when you speak you must believe it
[1:15:31] first
[1:15:32] amen before you even speak you must
[1:15:35] believe it first you must accept it
[1:15:37] first
[1:15:38] then you can speak amen therefore I say
[1:15:42] to you what things so ever you water
[1:15:45] desire
[1:15:49] do we have any specific desire there I'm
[1:15:52] sorry

[1:16:01] era will change
[1:16:02] technology will change
[1:16:08] somebody could have asked for a horse
[1:16:11] today you cannot ask for a horse
[1:16:16] everybody okay everybody okay so that's
[1:16:19] why the scriptures say whatsoever you
[1:16:21] desire
[1:16:22] depending on what where you are and your
[1:16:26] time
[1:16:27] amen amen
[1:16:30] When you pray believe that you ought to
[1:16:33] receive the
[1:16:35] have them
[1:16:37] for you to have it you must be you
[1:16:40] believe First that you already receive
[1:16:42] it then you're gonna have it if you
[1:16:44] don't believe that you receive it you're

[1:17:49] obtain a good report
[1:17:51] true faith we understand that the worlds

[1:18:00] things which are seen were not made of
[1:18:04] things which do what

[1:18:08] with our naked eye didn't start from
[1:18:12] what from this materials it starts from

[1:51:18] when we say Prosper message believer
[1:51:22] always think about money
[1:51:28] God didn't say prosper in money
[1:51:32] God said prosper

[1:51:40] let's deal with that aspect
[1:51:45] let's go to Festival
[1:51:48] foreign
[1:51:54] let's go to Festival chapter six

[1:54:01] somewhere
[1:54:03] good words healthy word
[1:54:06] saying the word amen and to the doctrine
[1:54:11] which is according to water godliness
[1:54:13] those men are proud watch verse four he
[1:54:17] is proud knowing water nothing but
[1:54:20] dodding about water and strife of word
[1:54:23] well off comes water envy and water and
[1:54:27] water really and water evil
[1:54:30] submersing which is like a suspicion
[1:54:33] perverse disputing of man of corrupt man
[1:54:37] and destitute of the water true
[1:54:40] supposing that water is water godliness
[1:54:44] from such the water withdraw thyself so
[1:54:47] this is not believers
[1:54:54] is not talking about believers
[1:54:58] he's talking first about the people that
[1:55:01] are perverted that things that again is
[1:55:04] what

[1:55:30] there is a godliness that has
[1:55:32] contentment that is what is important

[2:09:06] clothed the grass of the field which

[2:09:14] all you of water
[2:09:22] so your clothing is in the faith
[2:09:29] your food is in the faith
[2:09:34] your drinking is in the faith faith
[2:09:37] toward God that's why Jesus said have
[2:09:40] faith in
