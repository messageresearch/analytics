many God give me room to give my testimony one day I just called my dad one day and I was just battling demons and I go outside one day and I was with my two dogs and I looked up and and I called my dad and the Lord is my witness it was an Angel flying over my my mobile home and later on that night I was sleeping and there was about two cars pulled up behind that mobile I was in and they was having a they was having a gunfight not one bullet touched that mobile home and I called my dad and I said Dad it's time for me to come home it's it's just time and I'm and I'm telling you as a witness and and and I've I've I've lived here and and and brother and pastor and the Saints from up there in Ohio said they send their blessings and love to you to the congregation I reached out to the pastor up there and one brother witnessed to me he said brother I know what you going through he said but God shut every single door for me to come back home and I got on that plane I and I tell my dad I was about I had to take my rental back downtown and I called The Uber so I looked at that guy speedometer and the speed limit was around 4550 and this man was doing 40 I said Lord I'mma Miss This Plane so I called my mom and she said God to hold that plane up for you I get to the airport yes sir and it was nobody standing there at the desk so I called my brother and as anybody know my brother works for the airline so he said he's real my brother he I'm his brother he's going to fight for me he said you go to that desk the next the next attendant you see you tell them what's going on that fell said you go through the TSA check in and he said they're going to check your bags and I get to the desk I said Here Come the devil again and the lady said oh everybody's on my planes there so I said I just smiled out I said yes ma'am I'm just trying to get home so she walked off and left another lady came oh you supposed to be here hour and a half early I said yes ma'am I understand I said I'm just trying to get home so I said so what she she did was she said it's a plane about to leave she said you won't get home to 12 she said if I can get you on that plane and then she said oh you got a bag that's $40 and I said yes ma'am I understand so she wouldn't insist him she looked it didn't even charge me so I get on that plane I go to sleep and I'm telling you I'm telling you when I felt some warm come for me I stle and I closed my eyes on that plane I woke up I was laying in Charlotte and I and I'm telling you Saints I appreciate everybody's prayer because I'm telling you nothing nothing nothing you can't do and I'm telling you I'm holding them back but I'm telling you it's nothing you can't do without the power of God it's nothing I'm standing here as a witness I'm standing and I don't mean to hold the service up but this is on my heart the devil and my dad is a witness the devil tried to take my life twice this year twice this year and I and and the Lord and the Lord told me everything and I knew it I called the Saints one time and I and her name is uh sister Susan and I as I'm on the phone it was a warm that's come over and she said brother everything is going to be all right so I made it to where it was a guy I work with he fixed my car just enough I drove an hour to their church and I sat with the pastor and we had one of them 45 second Embrace and I just broke down and I knew and I knew and I knew it was time because he said I'mma tell you all you have to do he said there's nothing about whatever you had going on he said it's about you so when we sat there and prayed and it was a song and I'm going sing it for y'all one day I got to get it right and it's and it's a song um um by Toren Wells and it's called trenches and that song's may be about um six years old but he was saying in one part of that song he said I was going through a battle because he said I was trying to be my own Savior and once you try to put yourself in front of God God will tap you in the soldier and say come on back that's right and he took and I and I'm and and Lord's my is he took every single thing from me and I'm and I'm telling you I had two jobs that was taken I had my car that was taken and I gave my car away for free you know just trying to get back home my dad kept telling me but son it'll be okay and I was worrying about my dogs cuz I called everywhere the dogs was full and brother Charles when he's he them pit bulls it's a big thing up there they don't like them so they put them down and my dad kept telling me son just trust God just trust God and I literally I pulled up in that van and that was my last resort I wanted to do I took them dogs out and they just looking at me smiling looking at me smiling and I got there so as I'm walking to the door it was a couple came out and the and the husband looked at the first dog he run up to him and he broke down crying and he looked at me and said I'm not going to let you do that and he looked at his wife and he said I he said I give you my word if we can't find a home for these dogs I'll find a home for them they took both of the dogs and didn't have to put them down I said so that's why I know anybody if you have battles trust God God trust God I'm telling you anything you do trust God just trust him and please believe me just trust him it's nothing else I can't tell you it's so many words just trust God because if you can't go any other thing if you have doubt trust God cuz one thing God said and it's it's an nword he said I'll never I'll never leave

but when you when you've been there and you know what it's like for the Lord to get a hold of your life and give you a testimony anden it brings a it brings a a shout and it brings a joy and and we Rejoice with brother Kelly and God bless you and so happy to hear that test Tony amen if you have your Bibles you turn with us to the Book of Psalms chapter 27 amen as as our brother said we sure appreciate my father coming down helping us make the drive and sorry that my wife and baby couldn't be here this time but she's uh been dealing with some health issues and uh um with postpartum and everything and uh uh she got to where she couldn't eat well and she actually got to the place where she started um having non-epileptic seizures and uh we had to spend some time in the hospital um but just recently the Lord's done a real miracle and turned it around completely and so she's doing much better amen by the grace of [Applause] God so if you just continue to be praying for her that her strength would be continue to come back back amen but we missed then tonight and before we read uh we'll just read the whole chapter and then we'll have you be seated but this is just something the Lord put on my heart um while we were going through this trial here back home and Lord just begin to deal with me on some of these things so we'll start in verse one it says the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though when host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war shall rise against me in this I will be confident one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock and now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me therefore will I offer in this Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I will sing yeah I will sing praises unto the Lord hear oh Lord when I cry with my voice have mercy also upon me and answer me when thou said sest seek ye my face my heart said unto thee th face Lord will I seek hide not thy face far from me put not thy servant away in Anger thou Hast been my help leave me not neither forsake me oh god of my salvation when my father and my mother forsake me then the Lord will take me up teach me thy way oh Lord and Lead Me in a plain path because of mine enemies deliver me not over onto the will of mine enemies for false Witnesses are risen up against me and such as breathe out cruelty I had faint unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living wait on the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait I say on the Lord am amen we we could bow our heads for a word of prayer Heavenly Father we're so thankful for the opportunity of being in your presence once more Lord and filling the atmosphere as it's been built father Lord not just by a lord a work up but father it's the presence of the Living God and Lord we hear how your hand has reached down and brought one of your children home and father we Rejoice Lord that Lord and and father maybe there's still mothers sitting in here tonight they've got children Lord we know that you're the same yesterday today and forever father what you could do for brother Kelly Lord you could do father for another one father I I pray Lord that you just come down in a special way tonight Lord I I know I've got no ility of my own but father Lord we commit ourselves to you Lord and we ask that you have the right away in this meeting father Lord close our lips from speaking something contrary to your will and open them to speak what you would have for your children tonight dear Lord we'll give you all the glory and the honors we commit this service into your hands in Jesus name amen and amen you may have your seats tonight and if we want to have a title tonight we'll take it out of that first verse and we'd like to speak on the strength of my life amen the the the strength of my life and and when we're speaking of strength we realize that there's different types of strength you know there's strength in the natural that that would allow you to to lift something heavy or or to do great uh uh physical Feats that there's a natural strength that that lays in the muscle of a man or a woman uh and we think of a a religious strength where somebody would would depend upon a church for the strength right or or depend upon a just a Creed or or Dogma or or say I burn a candle every night and that's the strength of Christianity socalled but but we realize that we're speaking of a different type of strength when when we're speaking of here what David was talking about when he said the Lord is the strength of my life that's the strength that we're speaking about tonight it's the strength of a true son or daughter of God and it comes from the Lord and so when we look at this scripture it says the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid and if you look at the definition of strength it's the quality or state of being physically strong which isn't so much what we're speaking about tonight but another definition is the capacity of an object or substance to withstand great force or pressure and and if we look at the strong concordance for the word strength here it's it's speaking of a fortified place or a defense a Fortress or or stronghold and even Jeremiah wrote that oh oh Lord my strength and my Fortress my refuge in the day of Affliction we know that the name of the Lord is a strong tower and so when David writes the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid we realize that we have a fortress in this dark hour that we liveing we realize that the the the enemy has come in like a flood we realize that we Face the enemy every day day but when you realize where your strength comes from you realize you're hid away in the time of trouble like we read in the Book of Psalms 27 it said when the wicked even my enemies and my foes when they come against me he said when they come upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though and host should be camped round about me I will not fear and Whom Shall I Fear when the Lord is the strength of my life when the Lord is my Fortress when the Lord is my stronghold Whom Shall I Fear for we've not been given the spirit of fear right but of power and of love and of a sound mind and every man that's been born into this kingdom of God has not one thing to fear how many times when you turn on the message you hear brother Brandon trying to get the fear out of the people if you only knew who you were if you only knew where you stood and when you realize that you're standing in a fortress that is the strength of almighty God you can look at the enemies all around you and say I shall not fear you for my strength comes from the Lord amen we even have a promise this has been one of my favorite scriptures in Proverbs 3 it says when thou liest down Thou shalt not be afraid Thou shalt lie down and thy sleep shall be sweet amen here's a promise be not afraid of sudden fear neither of the desolation of the wicked when it cometh for the Lord shall be thy confidence and shall keep thy foot from being taken sometimes sometimes you you don't even have anything to be afraid of but you're you're waiting for something to be afraid of you're you're afraid of a sudden fear you're afraid that what what's going to be on the news when you wake up but we have a promise that you can lay your head on the pillow and go to sleep and rest and have peace in the midst of trials and tribulations because Whom Shall I Fear when the Lord is the strength of my life can you say Amen am amen but but we didn't always have this strength we were once without strength that's what the Bible says in Romans 5 for when we were yet without Strength In Due Time Christ died for the ungodly man is it okay if I read a little bit tonight amen for when we were yet without strength we we were weak we were a feeble people we were strengthless we were in a condition of weakness is that right but in that time God sent his only son that he might die for our sins and send back a strength upon the church is that right so there he went up to calary and there the blood dripped down his leg as it batted against that skin of that that animal as that cross was carried up to Gethsemane the strength was leaving his body and he was getting weaker and weaker but what was happening he was beginning to come to a place where he could transfer strength back onto the people of God and send back his Spirit upon the day of Pentecost to strengthen the church for the contest that laid ahead for you see we're in a contest friends we're in a battle every day and and brother Brandon preached the message of contest he said it's a test of strength and mean like those Indians that would take a rope and they would build a fire in the middle and they would play tug of war to see who could pull the other side Into the Fire he said the greatest contest is between Church uh the church and Satan is that right and there there Satan uh when this battle started in heaven Satan was kicked out and now he's trying to do everything he can to pull the Church of the Living God into the fires that he's built that's right is that right we we face it every day but God has given us a word that would become our strength amen is that right so that we would have something to fight back with so that we could take the rope and pull the enemies in into his own fire which he's built amen that what the enemy meant for you would turn around and you could pull the enemy into the fire not by your own strength but by the strength of the word of God and God gave us the greatest thing he could gave us was the word for that's how he overcame he overcame by the blood of the Lamb by the word of the testimony uh when he said it is written that's how he overcame and so that's how we're going to overcome he's G he we've been forward ified in the word of God uh the Lord is my strength the Lord is my Fortress and it's the strength of God's word in you Amen brother and sister you see it's not just a letter for the letter kth but it's the strength of the word of God when it comes into your heart and me God sent back a strength upon the church that could keep you in the time of trouble amen and even so much that Peter had he he had been saved he'd walk with the Lord but he still had to go up to Pentecost so that he could be converted and then he could strengthen his Brethren amen he didn't have it in him at the time but when he got the Holy Spirit there was something in him to strengthen his Brethren yes my brother oh and it's a strength that you can give out to others amen amen uh sometimes you draw strength from your pastor sometimes you just draw strength from your brother and your sister but but but also and that's that's wonderful amen God God God's given us a a people that we can do that but but you must come to a place in your life where you have a strength in your own life that's right amen where you know him as a personal God Amen and that's where David come to when he would write in in the Book of Psalms 19 he would say oh Lord my strength and my redeemer Psalms 28 the Lord is my strength and my shield yes sir uh skip down the Lord Lord is their strength he is the saving strength of his anointed Psalms 46 God is our refuge and strength a very present help and trouble Psalms 81 sing aloud unto God our strength Psalms 118 the Lord is my strength and song Psalms 144 blessed be the Lord my strength amen we realize where our strength comes from tonight our strength doesn't come from the building our strength doesn't come from the chairs our strength doesn't come from the music our strength comes from one place the Lord Our Savior and our God our strength comes from Elohim our strength comes from the one who created the heavens and the earth oh for in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Bible always also says that God is a spirit yes sir yes amen so when God gave us the word as our strength that's right but the Holy Ghost is the spirit of the word amen so it's not enough just to have the letter but but the word it it that is God that is the strength of Our Lives not just the letter but the word the spirit of the word the holy ghost that comes in your life yes oh and it makes you live out every word amen amen amen we were just at the hospital for a test there for for Bethany and when we were there there was an elderly uh lady there there that that was getting a test and and and she was full of life she was she was full of enthusiasm and she began to talk to us and and she said people ask me how I do it and she would begin to say she tell us that it was the Holy Spirit that that that was the reason she did it and and and and how you must have the Holy Spirit and I thought that's nice you know and and and and I believe maybe she had a you know a portion of that that would give her strength but but she had cut hair and ears and and so we realize that she was lacking something although she may have drawn strength from from the church or drawn strength from from those things to an element there was a greater strength that must come in the life amen that will line your life up with every word that's right amen and but God has promised us that strength yes Amen in the book of Isaiah 28 it talks about the coming of the Holy Spirit the great witness it talked about how with stammering lips and other tongues will he speak to this people and he said this is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing amen but just a few verses back in verse 5 through six it says in that day shall the Lord of hosts be for a Crown of Glory and for a diadem of beauty onto the residue of his people that's right and for a spirit of judgment to him that sth in judgment and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate amen Amen brother brandham speaks of this verse and he says what is he speaking of a great day when the witness would come what is our Crown the Holy Spirit crowns us the residue is the people that's left over he'll be a diadem a Crown of Glory a diadem of beauty and he says thank this is 700 years before it happened and and and then he says uh for strength to them that turn the back battle to the gate and he said them who is standing for him and with him this great spirit will be the strength of him that stands at the gate Amen in the battle he is our strength yes sir we rely upon him that's right not upon culture not upon education not upon things of the world not by power not by might but by my spirit sayth the Lord and he says the church rest solemnly in that he will be the strength of them that stands in the gate not his theological background not his denomination but the Holy Ghost will be his strength he will be the one that will stand at the gate he'll rely upon the strength of the Holy Spirit to turn the Ellen away amen amen we realize where our strength comes from because we're in a battle and I like how he says it there that he'll rely upon the strength of the Holy Spirit to turn the ellien away for in Hebrews 11 the faith chapter when it's talking about the hero of the faith it says how they quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong wax Valley and fight and turn to flight the armies of the aliens uh that that would be the Philistines that that would be the Giants in the land the ones that these Heroes of Faith came in contact with these aliens they turned them away by the strength of God and it was out of weakness that they were made strong yes my brother man for for God doesn't need our strength but like Paul wrote that that perfect strength is made perfect in our weakness that's right and how he would write that that my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness and the more weaker we can become brother and sister the more his strength can come into our lives amen just the more you can pour out of yourself the more you can die out of your habits and and your abilities and and ideas that's the more God can make known his strength in your life amen amen amen and like Elijah in in the day when he stood Against The Jezebel religions and against the systems of that day you know I'm sure he felt a feeling of rejection I'm sure there was times when he felt a feeling of loneliness but the thing is about the strength of the lord it's all that we need amen and that was all that Elijah needed in that day yes and and when brother Brandon was on the scene you know he would walk into the great big coliseums of Oral Roberts and Billy grahams and think my their their Ministry spun off of mine and here they are and does the Lord think less of me but the Lord begin to come down and speak to that I am your portion look up to look up and and see where your portion lays see where your strength comes from and I'll be the strength of your life and then your strength may not lie in in in nice homes and nice cars on this side your strength may not come from those things but but we have a strength yes my and because we've been made weak God can put a strength in our lives that would carry us through amen amen is that okay just to lay a foundation a little bit take your time the Lord your is the strength of my life amen and when we think about that we think about Samson Samson was one of the first ones brother brandom ever spoke on that was his first sermon was about Samson because brother brandom likes strength he said I couldn't I just can't imagine Samson being a great big strong man with big muscles brother B said I can't imagine him being that way for then the glory might come upon a man but the thing about Samson was he was he was weak he he he was a little man maybe a small framed man and maybe didn't maybe wasn't built in the great physical stature but but the thing about it was the anointing of the Lord would come upon him and the Lord would get the glory when God would move upon Samson and we look at the events of his life when a lion would come in the scripture would say the spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him right when he slew 30 men it was the spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him when he took a Jawbone and fought a thousand uh uh Philistines it was the spirit of the Lord moved upon them what what was was it about Samson it was a hidden power amen it was the hidden power that Samson had let come into his life and brother Brandon would say it's not like a uh taking a rabbit's foot and rubbing it it's not like a lucky horseshoe he said it's not something that we make up this hidden power isn't something that's just a lucky charm this hidden power comes through a birth where God puts his spirit inside of you and it's no longer you live but it's Christ that lives through you amen I'm talking about a hidden power am I'm not not something that you manufacture not something that you have to put on uh overcoming isn't some something that you have to just work up and force it's a hidden power that comes into your life oh and it makes the Christian experience a joyful thing it makes this battle that we're in a glorious fight because it's not resting upon our ability it's not going to be by might it's not going to be by power but it'll be by the spirit of the Lord as it moves upon us and begins to bring an overcoming where where where you would be about to say something wrong and something would come over you and say oh maybe you shouldn't say that and man you didn't teach yourself to do that it's something that come on the inside of you and begin to live out of you and manifest the word of God it's a it's a hidden power it's an anointing that rests upon your life uh that you could never do it that's it but it's God himself brother the Holy Spirit has come the person of Jesus Christ has indwelled himself inside of you that's the power that we're talking about that's the strength that we're talking about yes sir amen but the problem was Delilah came in and begin to deal with Samson after he had had the great experience of carrying the gates of the city and here come a Delilah and brother Brandon warned us that there's three things that a person should watch especially in the ministry and things it's woman money and popularity and brother BR said Samson fell from woman I believe was balum fell from money and Saul fell from popularity and so here comes Delilah in and she begins to begin to ask Satan or uh forgive me Samson where does thy great strength lie and Samson would say oh you know if they bind me with seven great wids and she would do it and say the pH Philistines be upon the Samson and and he would be able to break out of it and he be to do this three different times and say if they fast me with new ropes and if they weave the Seven Locks in my head with a web and I think it's amazing that DEA came to Samson four different times and and brother Brandon picks it up and and talks it and ties it into the the church how they they they tried to bind the Catholic church but he rose up on Martin Luther and broke the cord they tried to bind the Lutheran Church and he raised up a John Wesley and broke the cord and then they tried to bind it again but he rose up a Pentecostal church and broke the cord and he said now Pentecost is being bound by the same thing and it reminds me of those four bugs that would come in and try to eat away at the tree and they would try to eat through the fruit and through the leaves and through the bark but what they were really after was to get to the heart of the tree the LIF line where the sapl playay and here Delila come and she be to eat away at Samson and eat away at him four different times trying to get to the heart of Samson Samson where does your hidden power lay am mean what is the strength of your life Samson you offend me you say you love me what is the hidden power of your life amen but but the thing was Samson had given his strength to the Lord but he gave his heart to Delilah is that right amen and so Thea found where the secret lays and Samson says there hath not come a razor upon mine head for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb and if I be shaven then my strength will go from me and I shall become weak and be like any other man and so Delilah comes in and she begins to shave away those Seven Locks that lay upon his head and then she said Samson the Philistines be upon thee and he began to say I'll go out like every other time but he didn't realize that the Lord had departed from him amen there stood Samson and all of his glory his muscles were just as strong as ever his stature was just as strong as ever but he couldn't meet the challenge of the hour because the anointing of the Lord had departed from him am mean is that right and he found himself in a condition and he began to realize amen that his strength wasn't enough are are you with me I could I'm about 6'2 but if I was a dead man it don't matter how much muscle I have I would lay here like a pile of Flesh because it's the life that's in you that motivates you is that right it takes a life to motivate the muscle and so no matter how many muscles you have if there's no life in you it won't motivate you and no matter how many Faith muscles you have in your Christian walk without the spirit of the Lord to motivate it am it's not so much the muscle and Samson found out that that just knowing all the quotes wouldn't work amen Samson found out that just going to church on Wednesday and Sunday wouldn't be enough Samson found out that the mechanics wouldn't be enough it would take a Dynamics to come upon the mechanics to perform the work of the Lord amen and and and neither are the Dynamics good without the mechanics but it takes both it takes a mechanics and it takes the Dynamics amen I I think of that shunamite woman uh when she come in contact with the Elijah Ministry amen she was almost out of food for her and her family she was almost out of strength but when she was obedient to that Elijah Ministry and she sought first the kingdom of God and gave their meal and oil to that Elijah they come back forth a promise that the me would never run out and the oral wouldn't run dry until rain came on the earth amen you see what we're feasting on is meal and oil it's a word and Spirit Revival you you can't do away with one and keep the other and expect to have the strength to live an overcoming life amen it it's it's an unending Revival oh and it comes from the word of God as the spirit begins to Quicken it to you and the spirit begins to lead you through this message it's spiritual food and due season it'll it'll give you strength to the coming of the Lord amen it's a message that's full of vitamins amen but but you got to have the word and the spirit amen Samson's muscles Wen enough oh it would take the Dynamics am amen and I can imagine yes sir that this is the first time Samson has ever felt fear in his life probably for the very first time you see under that Nazarite vow that Samson lived under there was no fear he he wasn't afraid as long as he could feel that that's it you felt it you felt that anointing you felt that strength and as long as Samson lived under that Nazarite vow there was no fear amen amen but but like like I think of that eagle in the woods with brother Brandon that eagle was testing those two wings and as long as he knew those two wings were working he could fly away to safety any time amen under that Nazarite vow there was no fear but I can imagine for the first time Samson feels fear he said I'm not able to meet the challenge of the hour you see his long hair was his Nazarite vow that's right it showed that he'd cut himself from the world to to obey the word and brother Brandon would say that a hair to a woman is a Nazarite vow as well he said a Nazarite he said if a woman cuts off her hair she absolutely denies her Nazarite vow that she is a bride to Christ and brother brandom said a Nazarite is one that is consecrated for a purpose he said Samson was consecrated to a age and a purpose therefore he had long hair and the woman that's a child of God lets her hair grow to show that she's consecrated to every word of God now me it it may it it may get a little strong for a minute brother brandom said if she cuts it off I don't care how much she dances sings is in the choir or speaks in tongues or runs up and down or has all kind of Aid societies she is dead that's thus sayith the Lord the word of God she 1 Corinthians 14 she has denied her Nazarite vow and sold out to the God of this Modern Age oh and that's how the Pentecostal Church found themselves they they they had they had the worship they they had the dance they begin to speak in tongues as an Evidence but they would start to chop off their hair and start to put on pants and wear garments that pertain unto a man and the spirit of the Lord Lord would depart from them and they were left strengthless they were left because they had sheared away the word of God and brother brandom said committing SP spiritual fornications oh he said any word in the Bible That's rejected or if any self interpretation is put to it it's absolutely rejecting and committing adultery against the god that is your husband yes my brother take your time yes my brother yes sir we're talking about a vow now when I made a vow to my wife it was in sickness and in health in the good times and the bad times I am vowed to one woman and she's back in Ohio amen and when I'm on the road I'm not looking for any other thing I'm not looking for any other love I've got a wife and I have vowed myself to her and brother brandom said the bride of Christ is vowed to Christ and he is the word and he said that a a woman shouldn't even wink at another man well amen and that that's where a lot of the problems start sometimes it just starts with a wink amen and here with Samson intoa and sometimes it starts with a wink and then it progresses and progresses and you find yourself committing adultery with the one that you're vowed to amen and sometimes that wink my might be looking at a website about this message Man sometimes it starts with a wink uh maybe what they said about the Finland boy is true maybe what they said about the bridge is true and it starts with a wink and before you know it you're laying in an adulterous lap and you've lost your strength and you leave the message of the hour and you realize that you have no strength left you realize that the anointing has left you oh because you forsake even one word of God oh that's what the problem was Delilah be to shave off Samson's locks and that's what the problem brother Brandon would say that Luther was okay but they begin to build schools and begin to shave off Luther's locks and then they begin to shave off Wesley's locks and then they begin to shave off Pentecostal locks until they were left standing humiliated like a shorn woman without hair on her head or a born man amen and he said no wonder is juvenile delinquency he said no wonder the Secret's been discovered it's taking the baptism of the Holy Ghost out of the people and they're going for the things of the world instead of coming back to God Amen uh he would begin to rebuke even his own assembly he would begin to even rebuke brandom Tabernacle it say Samson the Philistines are upon you and he would say uh brandom Tabernacle worldism is creeping in among you he said what about it have you exposed your secret oh this is this is to the brandom Tabernacle he said have you exposed that secret that God give you when you were wallowing there in the sawdust a few years ago have you let it creep out with social former worship what's happened to you he said God can come down and perform a miracle and go right down through the audience and tell people the secrets of their heart and everything and heal the sick and Afflicted and do signs and wonders and preach his word as hard as they can by the Holy Ghost and people say well I guess that's all right we enjoy listening to it once in a while if we're not too tired and he would say brandom Tabernacle the Philistines are upon thee amen you realize the danger amen of losing your strength losing your enthusiasm you begin to cut off one lock at a time and you realize you're strengthless amen but but but I as for me in my house amen if if it if it ever comes to a place where the move of God becomes a shameful thing around this message anden I'll go out in the parking lot with a tambourine and worship my Lord amen if it ever comes to a place where it becomes an embarrassment something that the prophet preached then brother we'll go out in the woods and preach to the trees we will not give up our strength we will not give up our anointing we will not give up the Seven Locks of our seven seal message which has been restored and then this message broke the bonds off of our life we are not willing to go back to bondage oh let the bride stay free Let the Church of the Living God Walk in the liberty of the anointing of the word for your hour oh hallelujah oh will go out if we have to drink Branch water and eat soda crackers we will not give up our strength we will not be God wants separators God don't want mixers God wants separators amen we've been called by this message to come out from among them and be separate touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you oh come out from among them brother B said If a woman bobbed her hair it was even UNC commmon thing for her to even pray and she dishonors her husband in doing so that's brother man say maybe sometimes ministers hasn't gotten nerve enough to tell you he said this is one time you're going to hear it oh I believe we still need men of God that'll call right right and wrong wrong I believe we still need men of God that will lift up this message no matter if you have to stand alone I'll stand with what brother brandham taught this was that seventh star this was that seventh angel messenger and I'm not ashamed to be identified with the message of the hour I am not ashamed to preach the near coming of the Lord amen the world is falling apart politics are falling apart Oh California is shaking the Lord may come back before the morning we are living in the last hour I'm not ashamed to say that Holiness is still a part of the word oh I'm not ashamed to say that baptism is not entitles I'm not ashamed to say that it's still still wrong to have abortions it's still wrong to be a homosexual it's still wrong to be a transgender amen I'm not going to back down to any devil this is the only strength I have this is the only strength if we give up this message we will be left all strengthless and we'll be just as bound down as a denomination but as for me in my house this is the strength of my life Hallelujah this word which has been sent down yes amen the mighty Angel has descended God has restored a strength to the church oh well we they they should have never picked up the razor in the first place brother Kelly they pick up the razor trying to make the message a little better trying to add their opinion trying to trying to alter it a little bit the problem Amen in the presence of the Lord dep Parts oh because they've Shor off the locks they should have never picked up the in the first place because when God gave us this message it was already perfectly sheared amen legalism was already sheared off this message before I ever got it theism was already sheared off this message before I ever got it all the false auctions were already sheared off all of the nonsense was already sheared off when we got this message it was already perfect there's never going to be a time where I got to pick up a razor and make it a little better no I've got no need for a pair of scissors I've got no need for a Razor this message is good the way we got it it'll be good tomorrow it'll be good next week it'll be good next year it's the strength of the Bride of the Living God amen amen hallelujah Glory Hallelujah he is the strength of my life yes my bride oh it's what is it it's a Nazarite vow thank it's one that is consecrated for a purpose amen I don't believe God's looking for a halfway bride I believe he's looking for a Nazarite bride amen we're consecrated for a purpose am amen we are not the same this is a quote ye are separated people holy unto the Lord dedicated to the word and the spirit of God to bear fruit of his promise of this day and you're not of them you're supposed to be a different people but brother Brandon would read that poem we let down the bars we compromis with sin we let down the bars the Sheep got out what how did the goats get in it said you let down the bars you compromised and it may only have started with one word but that's what sent the whole human race and made one word man sheer and sheer and sheer you know there's sometimes where my little boy he's a year old now and he's arry as can get and he will sit over there and and do things that he knows he's not supposed to do just to get our attention and he'll open those cabinets and and there's there's there's cleaning and chemicals and things in there say no buddy you can't do that and and he'll open it again and we'll W his leg say no you can't do that and after about the H hundredth time you get a little tired and it would be easy just to stop correcting him because because you have to get up and and you have to make an effort and it would be easy to compromise but then what would happen to him he he he raise up and and and have no respect for what we say and and who knows how it would turn out and and they'd probably get in the cabinet and get hurt and and it would be easy to compromise but but we're dedicated to a purpose where a Nazarite people were consecrated to this age and this purpose we're dedicated to the word and spirit for our day amen and when my wife was in the hospital there comes a certain pressure that that maybe uh for me and for brother Wayne we bring greetings from Brother Wayne by the way that's that's his baby laying in that hospital and and and the the the enemy would try to come in and say just just hold off that preaching a little bit just I if you just compromised here then then I wouldn't attack your baby so much or I wouldn't attack your wife so much and it would be easy uh uh from that human element to compromise but we are under a Nazarite vow and would say Satan I will not compromise I will not bow down I will not bend the knee you're going to have to leave amen amen because I'm not moving I am not amen God gave us this land God gave us this third land God gave us our inheritance and we will not March back out of here because of some devil that would try to come in and steal our strength no sir oh we will not leave our promises we will not stop believing for our children we will not stop preaching healing we will not stop preaching the Holy Ghost no sir oh it may not be popular in this hour but we are not going to stop preaching amen amen amen say why is it so strong hallelujah hallelujah take your time if it was wrong before it's still wrong I I if cutting your hair was wrong before it's still wrong me if a woman wearing pants was wrong before it's still wrong it hasn't changed oh but by amen amen oh one generation after another oh because somebody doesn't have the strength to stand up and deal with it oh it creeps into the church and the next thing you know yes you have no strengths that's it worldism has creeped in exactly right why do we preach it so strong brother Stephen yes sir because the other day I was in my study and I just began to look at this quote where brother Brandon's talking about Moses and he said there Moses he was Vindicated there was a pillar of fire Vindicated him and and now he begins to say you shall not add onto the word which I command you neither shall you diminish odd of it it said don't add one thing to it and don't take one thing away from it stay just say what it says yes that you may keep the Commandments of the Lord your God which I command you brother Bram said this was Moses speaking to Israel after he had been Vindicated by God by a pillar of fire and knowed he was proven to be God's servant servant to lead them out and before they went into the land before they entered Moses said now the words that I have spoken unto you I call Heaven and Earth to witness against you if you add one thing to it or take one word from it you'll not stay in the land where the Lord God gives you and then brother brandom said so say I in the name of Jesus Christ don't you add one thing put your own ideas in you just say what is said on this you just do exactly what the Lord to do don't add to it am and farther down he says don't take some new thing everywhere be more than that come but don't take these new things amen Amen brother St as I begin to read that in my study I just closed my eyes and I took a vow before the Lord that as long as the Lord gives me strength and as long as the Lord gives me Grace I will stand for this message under a Nazarite vow and by the grace of God do what I can not to add one word or take one word from this message not to Shear off one thing from this message oh because it is the strength of my life amen amen it is our headship and brother Brandon would begin to say how there how how how there is a hope brother Bron would begin to say he said he said one hope we have that while they had Samson bound there was a new shock grow it out and he said I'm praying God that he'll grow it out of here somewhere a new shock that'll shake the Philistines like never before like they've never been shook before amen there'll be a skipping down there'll be a shock of power a secret power of the Holy Ghost grow out again just as certain as anything and it'll do the job in the last days God grant that we're all numbered with that shock when it comes out sir oh hallelujah thank God that there is a place that we can be identified that is not a strengthless people but I believe I'm identified with that new shock am me not just because I go to a message church but because I've been bursted under the word for my day there's been a new growth anden the Pentecostals pushed them out but oh in God's mercy those seven curls begin to grow back and God will have a bride God will have a people that are strengthened by the word God will have a people God will have a bride oh I said I will restore sayith the Lord all that the bugs have eaten I will restore oh oh it looks pretty dismal but then you look closely what is that on the back of Samson's head oh I see some hairs I see these Seven Locks amen and brother brandham said amen I he said but notice hallu and the spoken word is the Original Seed he said his preaching will be with the spirit and strength line of God's word talking about the messenger and the seed is not air with the Shu he said notice at the opening of The Seven Seals Revelation 10 the full word is to be born into manifestation again and Vindicated by the spirit of God in the full strength as it was when he was on Earth manifested in the same way doing the same things that it did when it was here on Earth Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen oh there's been a new shock grow out amen and I'm thankful for for men of God like brother Stephen that can be identified with the message of strength amen amen it's the strength of my life yes my brother and as we turn the corner here now David I think it's amazing that David wrote this scripture because if we backgound it in the early days of the children of Israel they were they were identified with that Pillar of Fire and me the almighty God was a father King to the children of Israel and me He brother the church age book here is describing how he he busied himself over them he he gave them Mana from Heaven he gave them all these things he was their father King he they were the only nation to which he was truly God but but they begin to look out at the Philistine Army and think my if I just if we just had a king like they do to lead us into battle you know and and the thing of it was God was going to give them that in the person Jesus Christ am me but they got ahead of the word exactly right and so they said we want a king like they do and they said we still want the priest to blow the trumpets we still want all the church order it's it's just that we want a king like them and we want human leadership instead of the leadership of God and when they re when they rejected that and their Samuel stood as a prophet in their midst who had the word of God and spake as a mouthpiece of God and it wasn't that they were rejecting Samuel they were rejecting the king they were rejecting the leadership of the Holy Ghost and when they rejected that they although they still sing the songs and did all those things they rejected the very thing that made them different they rejected the very thing it was that Pillar of Fire it was that leadership of the Holy Ghost that's what made him different you see brother brandom said the one difference between Israel and the rest of the Nations was God that's it the one difference that's it only one but God put God to the side and Israel was like any other Nation he said when Samson cut off his hair he was like any other man and when you put the leader leadership of the Holy Ghost aside and the church is nothing but the world with God's name attached to it and I say that because for a reason they rejected Samuel the word prophet and then they took Saul as the king that's as their human leadership they rejected the leadership of the Holy Ghost and took Saul right amen now in first Samuel 15 I if you can pull it up that'd be great if not that's okay we're just going to read through this real quick take your time now this is when Samuel comes to Saul right and he says the Lord sent me to anoint you to be king over his people over Israel now therefore hearken onto the voice of the words of the Lord and He commands them and begins to tell them to go and smite amalec and utterly destroy all that they have and spare them not and so Saul gathers his army and lies in weight and and he had the kenites depart from the amalekites and and so and so Saul goes into battle and and Saul smelt the amalekites from Hava until thou comest to sh that is over against Egypt and 1 Samuel 15 I believe we're verse eight here it says and he took AAG King of the amalekites alive and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword but Saul and the people spared AAG and the best of the sheep and of The Oxen and of the fatlings and the Lambs and all that was good and would not utterly destroy them and so the Lord repented for even making Saul King amen and and so Samuel uh Saul comes and greets Samuel and and and Samuel um when the Lord says it repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king for he has turned back from following me and hath not performed my Commandments and it grieved Samuel and he cried onto the Lord all night and when Samuel Rose early to meet Saul in the morning it was told Samuel saying Saul came to caramel and beheld he set him up a place and has gone about and passed on and gone down to gilo amen now listen closely here and Samuel came to Saul and Saul said unto him blessed be thou of the Lord I have performed the Commandment of the Lord so Samuel says then Sam then why can I hear sheep bleeding if you've performed the word of the Lord then what is that noise what are those animals bleeding and and the Lo of the ox and and Samuel says well we we've brought them from the amalekites and we' spared the best of the sheep and of the ox and to sacrifice unto the Lord and Samuel said stay and I will tell thee what the Lord has said to me this night and he said unto me say on and Samuel said when thou was little in thine own sight was thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel and the Lord Anointed The King over Israel and the Lord sent thee on a journey and said go utterly destroy the amalekites and fight against them until they be consumed wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the Lord but didst fly upon the spoil and did evil in the sight of the Lord you see s Saul he fell because of popularity is that right that's the voice of the people he took over the word of the Lord and he and he fell and he said Saul when thou was little in thine own sight that's right I exalt that you were exalted into a place of power you used to be little in your own sight and brother Brandon would say he would see people have an experience with the Holy Ghost and then go out on the field and deny it deny every bit of it because maybe they get a little buil up or they get a little popular and they would deny the very thing U but but but the Holy Ghost if it was good enough to save us brother step it's good enough for me it's good enough to keep us amen but the problem was popularity begin to set in and we realize amen that God has placed his anoint ing Upon Our Lives amen and if he would ever remove it then this is just about a a couple dollars worth of chemicals and dust there's nothing good about Isaac Hatfield amen but the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob has put his favor upon my life amen because of his grace and his mercy and without that I'm helpless without that I'm nothing but Saul began to fall and say I have obeyed and he would say Samuel said hath the Lord is great Delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord and he would begin to say behold to obey is better than sacrifice saw you should have just obeyed the word saw you you did a little too much extracurricular you had a command but here you spared King AAG here you spared these animals amen it would have been uh uh better to just obey and because thou Hast rejected the word of the Lord he hath also rejected thee from being King oh my that's pretty hard Saul said unto Samuel I have sinned for I have transgressed the Commandment of the Lord and thy words because I feared the people and obeyed their voice problem and and now therefore I pray thee paron my sin and turn again with me that I may Worship the Lord and Samuel said unto Saul I will not return with thee for thou Hast rejected the word of the Lord and the Lord hath rejected thee from being King over Israel and then in verse 28 it says and Samuel said unto him the Lord hath rent the Kingdom of Israel from thee this day and hath given it to a neighbor of thine which is better than thee amen amen now the kingdom begins to transfer to David yes my brother and then it says in verse 29 and also the strength of Israel will not lie nor repent for he is not a man that he should repent and there Saul hewed King AAG into pieces there in front of the Lord and me he did what s Saul should have done forgive me Samuel HED him into pieces what Saul should have done in the first place but he heeded to popularity but there there begins to come a transfer amen and now in Psalms 52 it's a it's a it's a Psalm of David when doe the adomite came and told Saul and and in verse seven it says lo this is the man that made not God his strength but trusted in the abundance of his riches and strengthened himself in his wickedness but I am like a green olive tree in the house of God I trust in the mercy of God forever and ever amen amen can you stay with me just for a few more minutes as we as we close down here amen this was the man that wrote in Psalms that God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever this is the one this is David who wrote Thou Art the god of my strength the rock of my strength this this is David who had also come from Small Beginnings he had been snatched from the uh from a shepherd and a sheep coat and lifted up to royalty but the difference was David knew where his strength came from David when he got a little bit of a little bit of prestige he didn't he didn't forsake the Lord but constantly he would be riding Oh Lord You're the strength of my life oh Lord the wicked even my enemies come against me uh Lord but you're the strength of my life amen and the Lord is the strength of Israel now in Isaiah 30 it says that walk to go down into Egypt and have not asked at my mouth to strengthen themselves in the strength of pharaoh and to trust in the shadow of Egypt therefore shall the strength of pharaoh be your shame and the Trust In the shadow of Egypt your confusion now I uh we don't have it up on the screen I wish we did but I come through the the scriptures here and strength is mentioned in the Bible about 230 some times I believe but in the book of 1 Samuel 15 that we just read that it said the strength of Israel is not a man that he could lie just paraphrasing in that scripture it's a capital S strength of Israel amen amen and that strikes me amen as very significant because we've just read about the strength of pharaoh we just read about different strengths but there's only one capital S anden there's only one Capital strength and that's the strength of Israel amen now now now that's the same strength that brought Moses and the children of Israel out of Egypt amen that's the same strength that was with Joshua when he crossed over Jordan that's the same strength that was with Gideon that's the same strength that was with Samson that's the same strength that was with Enoch and David the strength of Israel was with Daniel and the lionen the strength of Israel was with Rahab and Esther and Tamar and I don't believe it's just the strength of Israel but I believe it's the same strength to this Gentile bride that come down in the upper room and F 120 vessels I believe it's the same strength that come into brother brandom's meetings and said you live at such and such an address and you're from such and such a place that's right amen I believe it's the same strength that opened this messag amen amen I believe it's the same strength that would say I take every spirit in this building under my control amen I believe the Lord himself shall descend with a shout and I believe there's benefits to his strength yes sir the same strength brother that created You Out of the Dust of this Earth huj I believe it's that same strength that can heal your body amen amen I believe the same strength that called you is the same strength that can keep you I'm talking about the strength of Israel I'm talking about capital S I'm talking about the one who had his picture taken with brother brandom I'm talking about the one in that picture brother identified that's my Lord up there what was it a strength had descended back onto the church yes siren it's the same strength that's with us it's the same strength that's keeping you yes sir it's the keeping P why are you still here Church why are you still here when you've been through trials and you've been through tests and you've been through so many things and you're still here it's the same strength amen amen that kept that kept men Through the Ages oh it's the same strength that's keeping you oh the strength that called you it can keep you amen it's the strength in the midst of Trials when brother brandham had lost his mother and wife and he come to a junction amen amen but what happened the devil's trying to tell him that you've served the Lord you've done all these things and look where you're at oh why don't you just give up why don't you just stop serving the lord but something come over brother Brandon was in a place of decision is that right but something come over him oh and he said the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord and this just struck me you know what brother Bram said he said I felt relief amen and that strikes me because you see the devil would try to tell him that the Lord's forsaken you and and and if you just stop serving the lord you you'll get relief that way but that's not the case there's no relief in the devil's proposition but when brother brandham took a stand with the Lord and said the Lord gives and the Lord takes away and blessed be the name of the Lord there come a relief over him amen and I know the Lord's press I know the enemy is pressing you I know you're in great trials and great great heartaches at times and you feel like you have you're out of strength oh but just take sides with the word amen amen now is not the time to compromise now is not the time to give up now is not the time to let down oh it's the strength you know what when my when my wife when my wife was there in the hospital for for six about six days and then we had a youth camp coming up and there was something in her said I've got to be at that camp and and and the Lord had even before then begin moving in such miraculous ways I I I seen the Lord do things that seemed impossible I I seen the Lord working in a way we never thought maybe even that could happen but she said I've got to be at that youth camp and here she comes and and just just a few days before she could couldn't even hardly leave the house she could couldn't even walk outside hardly didn't have the strength would have seizures and and here she comes into this camp and and and we'd have to even almost carry her out of the service at times because she would have these seizures and things and and and she would go outside and rest for a few minutes and get something to drink and and come back in and and there where they're about to have a prayer line service and and and she would stand there in the back and and it amazed me because there she was she would be fighting through seizures and and and and instead of being just distraught she would just lift up her hands and start start praising the Lord she she she when she didn't hardly have any strength she would stand on feet and just start start entering into the service and then when she went through that prayer line Amen in an instant all the all the anxiety and all the depression left her amen and I I could say to her amen we'll give God the glory and if I could ask her Bethany what was your strength it was the same strength it was the same strength of Israel that brought them through the Red Sea where does your strength come from Hallelujah you know there's something that I'm realizing friends yes sir that the God that I serve amen isn't a different God than the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob I I I've believed that but it's becoming very real to me even lately when you when I come to church Hallelujah when I enter my prayer closet Hallelujah the God that I serve amen is is not a different God hallelujah it's the strength of Israel it it it's Jehovah the Old Testament it's Jesus of the new amen amen and in the presence of the Lord amen if we could just recognize yes my the potential yes sir he's the everpresent God hallelujah he's the god of the valley Hallelujah he's the god of the mountain oh oh oh David would say hallelujah wheer shall I go from thy Spirit whe shall I flee from thy presence if I Ascend up into heaven Thou Art there if I make my bed in hell behold Thou Art there that just struck me even just I think earlier today I I was looking at that you know Saul rejected the word right and the Lord repented that he ever made him a king right but here David full of mistakes full of failures and he he would say Lord I can't even get away from your presence Lord you're you're my strength lord I can't even I can't even Escape your mercy lord I can't even Escape Your Grace you see there must have been something about David that was different than Saul there must have been an element of election over his life he was a man after God's Own Heart that his lineage would come forth through that line there must have been something about him that even in his mistakes and his failures oh he say Lord somehow you're ever present when I'm in the mountain you're there and when you lead me to the valley you're still the lily of the valley you're the everpresent god you're the never failing God like brother brandom had that Vision don't fear to go and do anything for the ever presentent the never failing presence of the Lord is with you wherever you go in Church of the Living God the everpresent presence is with the Church of the Living God the strength of the Lord is still with his people leading us and guiding us if we could just recognize amen and maybe sometimes Hallelujah we just need a little attitude adjustment we we come to church but we're really not here right we we come to church and and we're we're we're just worried about the day and we fail to recognize that we are in the presence of the everpresent god and Martha when she recognized that presence she said even now even now Lord I've had disappointments yes sir my brother's in a grave but even now Lord and brother Brandon would say that she's at the right place Hallelujah before the right Divine person with the right mental attitude speaking the right words believing the right things them old cogs is working right together something has to happen Amen brother brandom said you put me on record tonight in these recorders I have no apology for this remark that I'm fixing to make I believe in prove that the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass the right mental attitude but you've got to have the right attitude the attitude is what brings the results I believe it but I don't know now that's not the right attitude the right attitude is to receive it and say it's thus sayith the Lord then it's right and brother Brandon said no one ever came to Christ in the right attitude but what went away with what they asked for No One amen amen amen I I think it's you come to a place sometimes where you got to get your attitude right amen and brother Brandon say sometimes with gifts and callings amen the musicians can come sometimes with gifts and callings It's usually the one that runs from it that God chooses because he said that these other men would say I want more power to move mountains and and brother brenon would say God can you give me power to move mountains he said I'll tell you I'll do something for you if you let me move mountains he said he wouldn't he couldn't can't even move himself to the right attitude that's it so he would never move mountains for God that's it Oh but you can come to the place amen you stop looking at the symptoms amen and say Lord I see Lord amen I read in the Bible about the strength of Israel amen and Lord it was a capital S Lord it must have been talking about youen Lord I read about a God that wasn't just a god of the mountains but a god of the valley amen and Lord you said if I ask I shall receive you said if I seek I shall find am you said if I knock it shall be opened unto me you said Lord that all things are possible to them that believe you said if you say to this mountain be that removed and cast into the sea it may not happen right away but Lord when you spoke it but it brought the right attitude brother Brandon would say someone come I believe it's in the prayer line and and was wanting a baby and the Lord would speak back to her thus sayith the Lord that she would have that baby and she went and she started to get the booties ready and started to get everything ready because what happened when that word hit her heart it put her in the right attitude amen and when you feed on this word amen it begins to put strength back into you it begins to put your attitude right and you say oh Lord I may feel sick but by your stripes I am healed that's it I may feel bound but by the authority of your word I am free amen amen when's the last time you just said it I am free I am free amen oh when you didn't feel like it but you said I am free amen I am free amen for the Bible said let the weak say I am strong I am strong amen amen oh you may not feel like it tonight Hallelujah but our strength doesn't come from our feelings hallelujah our strength comes from the word amen amen like Abraham amen amen I'm out of time I've got L there but Abraham oh yeah that's right the Lord began to build a covenant with him amen amen and he begin to show him an unconditional Covenant amen but as he moved through Genesis he confirmed what he was going to do how he's going to do it Abraham went through those stages right but he come to Genesis 17 he's 99 years old and Sarah is 89 and the Lord appears to him as El sh oh he said Abraham amen I know you're weak Sarah's you're you're as good as dead your bodies are as good as dead Abraham but I've given you a promise that the seed's not going to come forth through another man but it's going to come forth through you and Sarah how's it going to be Lord oh let me just open your eyes to something I've been walking with you but now I'm I'm going to show you who I am amen one of my names I'm El Shadi Abraham I know it looks impossible but you're going to have a baby amen and in order to have that baby you're going to need a new body so Abraham you just draw yourself up and begin Nursing From the promises because it was elhadi because brother Brandon would show us that he was wounded for our transgressions and Bruise for our iniquities he said it's healing for the body and healing for the spirit I mean because usually you're battling in at least one of those Realms almost all the time but God has provided for you a strength am you see elshad wasn't for every age elshad didn't belong but brother brandham said that's what he done to the Pentecostals after Wesley's age he let the Pentecostals nurse his own strength his own Holy Spirit as a baptism back into their weak bodies to give them faith for the Rapture amen faith for the Miracles I shadow the eye what he did to Abraham and to his seat after him watch believing confirmation blood Covenant now injecting himself his strength into the people amen it didn't belong to every age but in in our hour God is injected his own strength yes my brother into the church yes sir because we're reading out of Psalms 27h that's a a Rapture text oh and the strength that I'm talking about it's a strength that you can nurse from that will lead you all the way like Abraham and Sarah to a body change to bring forth a promised son would you stand to your feet tonight it's the strength of Israel it's not just to Abraham but it's to his seed and instead of getting weaker we're getting stronger oh the church is getting weaker every time every hour every age but the bride is getting stronger and in the midst of lead DEA in The Darkest Hour we've ever been we're stronger than we've ever been before because we're Nursing From elhi it doesn't matter how low you get you know brother Bram tells about that Paul Raider and we're all familiar with it but he told it this way in a way that just struck me he said Paul had that dream of trying to get that log back to the camp but you know I think usually I've imagined it that it was a great big tree that he he wouldn't you know have the strength to carry back but the way brother Brandon tells it here it's it's a tree that he would normally have the strength to carry but he had just gotten weak his strength was gone but in the time of his weakness the Lord would speak and say oh there's a river right over there just roll it into the river Paul would say I usually have the strength to carry these but I'm just weak you ever get to that place all this Christian Journey sometimes you start off you feel so strong you find yourself at a place where you come to a juniper tree Lord I don't have the strength to go on brother brandom said when he come to that place he tried to take his own life twice that's the seven thing Angel messenger had got so low he tried to take his own life but God had prepared a place where he could renew his strength and sometimes you get to that place but God has prepared a way all that you don't have to carry that load anymore just come nurse from my promises nourish yourself back to strength amen if we could bow our heads and close our [Music] eyes in the time of weakness in a time of absolute where you feel like you've reached the end of your strength maybe that's you tonight maybe you feel like you've reached the end of your strength you feel like you can't go on another day maybe somebody that's on the the stream maybe you've even had thoughts of taking your own life cuz you just feel like you don't have the strength to fight another day you're weary you're so weary you cry out to the Lord Lord why has Thou forsaken me Lord why has you left me in this Valley Lord I don't have my own strength Lord why have you left me here Lord I prayed and I cried out and I'm I'm still sick sick I I prayed and I cried out and I'm still battling Lord why have you left me oh but God knows where you're at tonight God knows the condition you're in and he's still the everpresent God Amen and he's given us promises that after you have suffered I'll establish you I'll strengthen you I'll settle you in the book of Hebrews he said for verily for a few days he's chasten enough to ask his own pleasure but for a prophet prophet he said no chastening for the present seeth to be joyous but Grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby wherefore lift up the hands which hang down in the feeble knees and make straight paths for your feet lest that which is lame be turned turned out of the way let it rather be healed you see L your struggle is temporary hallu oh but almighty God is eternal he's not left you he's never left you maybe you've lost the joy of your salvation tonight Nehemiah wrote that the joy of the Lord is our strength and you've lost your joy Maybe maybe the devil's tried to isolate you in a complex self-pity maybe thinking nobody in the church loves you maybe thinking God doesn't even love you oh and you don't no longer have the strength of joy in your life but I believe God can do for you like David restore the joy of your salvation you remember what it was like when you first got saved yes Lord you remember what it was like when you felt like you had strength to to to to to just defeat every enemy that raised its head and now you feel like you don't even have strength to lift up your sword oh but I believe elshad eyes is in the room I believe the strength of Israel is in the room tonight I don't just say that he said wherever two or three are gathered oh just begin to get a right attitude towards him now maybe you've had a need for some time maybe you've even been offended at the Lord that he hasn't answered it yet but instead of crying out and rebuke why don't you just begin to say even now Lord even now Lord Lord I recognize you're here and even now Lord I'm going to change my attitude all things are possible Lord Heavenly Father we call upon your name right now dear Jesus Lord we've seen your strength in this meeting already how you've brought a prodigal home Lord how you've taken a people like this Lord and giv them a strength to believe

needs that there is an elshad ey and Lord we're just like your babies Lord we're just like your little children we get so weak Lord we have no strength of our own but like David the Lord Lord is our
