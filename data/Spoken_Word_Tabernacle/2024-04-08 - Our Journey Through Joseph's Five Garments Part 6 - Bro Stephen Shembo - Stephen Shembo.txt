to God I believe everyone is up to date with the sermon your pastor will never forget this one I believe you're reading your Bible twice a day one chapter in the morning one chapter a night you got your cood you got your church ages your 70 weeks of Daniel somebody's in a seal somebody's in adoption or someone is listening to the message of the hour when I enter into heaven I would just click on YouTube I say father look at the YouTube I reminded them every day every Sunday to make sure they put their head in the word that's what brother brandham say he said put your head in the word if you need the coat I put it for you you need the Cod oh you already know about it somebody say no no no no no we already enough bullet [Laughter] amen Lord's willing the young Sisters Meeting is on April the 20th you already know about it and April the 27 27 that will be our question and answer and young men meeting I'm still waiting for the dates whenever you ready you let me know I believe brother Kelly I got everything squared away I didn't forget anything so let's go straight to our scripture and pick up where we left on Sunday amen Glory Glory Glory Glory what a wonderful service on Wednesday Wednesday is like a [Laughter] convention amen Wednesday it's our convention Glory Glory same scripture again Genesis 49 verse 22 I believe you can hear me okay am amen amen all right praise God Genesis 49 verse 202 if you there you can say amen glory to God the Bible says Joseph is a fruitful bow you remember this now amen even a fruitful Bow by a well so this boy will never run dry no matter what you do he has a permanent well that is following him wherever you put him whether it's in the wilderness or whichever place he will Blossom because he have an internal resource where he's drawing water moisture from so he doesn't care about the weather amen glory to God you might be seated whose branches run over the wall so he's blessing you cannot stop it even if you put a fence his cup always run over amen amen that's what David says and the Bible says in verse 23 The Archers which are his brother have sorely grieved him and shed him and hated him we went through this but despite The Grieving despite the shooting despite the hatred but his b AB in strength so nothing change even though you hurt it doesn't mean that your Holy Ghost have decreased because you in pain you are still until the day of what so it doesn't mean that because you're crying your Holy Ghost is decreasing or your battery is getting low it's an internal battery amen he say his bow he bow in strength and the arm of his hands were made Strong by the hands of the Mighty God of Jacob amen the same God God of Abraham Isaac Jacob the same is the god of Joseph from there is the shepherd the stone of Israel if you will become yes go ahead my friend say Amen if from Joseph is coming the shepherd and the stone of Israel is coming even from there what do you think the devil will be with Joseph love him verse 25 even by the god of your father who Jacob or Israel who shall help you and by the almighty who shall bless you with blessings plural of the heaven above blessings of the deep that lies under blessings of the breast and of the womb the blessings of your father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors Abraham and Isaac to the utmost bound of the Everlasting Hill they shall be on the head of Joseph and we found out that Joseph his Blessing is greater than Jacob don't worry it's greater than Isaac it is greater than Abraham but when I say greater than Jacob you had a problem do you remember he saw a dream and in the dream he saw the Sun and the Moon they were doing what and his father say you think that me and your mother so in the Zodiac his father is bowing down so he's blessing is above his father now are we okay now are we are we did you get your answer so the blessing of Joseph is above Jacob Jacob have to bow down and it's above Isaac and it's above Abraham that's why he's a perfect type of Christ in other word he can only reach Christ only Christ can be this because of his fullness we all receive a portion amen the Bible says they shall be on the head of Joseph and on the crown of the head of him that was what separate from what his Breen why do they have to repeat that word separate from his brother they put the blessing they put the blessing they say they put the blessing on you because you were separate from your brother in other word they anoint you they anoint you and they sit down they say you receiving all of this because you were separated from your brother so is that separation good or bad do you see now amen so no separation no overflowing of blessings everything work together for good let's go to act chapter 7 even if you go to the uh the book of Deuteronomy that we read last Sunday you will see Moses saying whom has been separated from his brother they keep repeating that so that separation is very important even though we don't like it amen amen but brother Bram say God sometime he speak things purposely to make people go I have the qu brother Bram say God purposely Jesus was speaking things to weed down amen the crowd amen I have the quot amen please remind me and I'll put the quote on the group chat that was the son of man Ministry if we got the son of men Ministry what do you expect because he's the same yesterday today and forever so sometime a bullet will come out to remove the Shar right it's written in the Book of John I'm not going to be the one shooting no it is the holy spirit doing that if I do it then it's manmade we don't want that sir because that one is whoever is not smiling at me get the bullet HH we don't want that we want the Holy Spirit who knows the heart of the people and do you know that Jesus never even stopped there after he finished he turned around to his disciple he say do you want to go also if I say that here they will put me on Tik Tok the pastor is chasing people Jesus turned around he said do you want to also go it is the word of God and Peter say h going forever forever where should we go again where do you want me to go where do you want to go where do you want me to go outside of this message going back to the Catholic Church the Presbyterian the Baptist the Pentecostal which church are you going to take people back which denomination there is no am that's how you start I'm trying to read the scripture oh my let's go to Acts chapter 7 Oh Glory to God verse 9 if you dare you can say amen amen and the patriarch moved with what Envy clear jealousy and sold Joseph into what Egypt you know when we say sell Joseph to Egypt sometime we don't don't really understand but let's see if we will find they sold him to Egypt what has Egypt represent praise God he say and sold him into Egypt but I love the but in the Bible but God was with God was with him when they sold him amen when they are telling you God is there am even though he looks like God is not there because our way of understanding God is there we want to see okay if they want to tell me God come and cut everything off and change the situation no sometime even if he looks like nothing is happening God is there amen that's why David say even if I put my bed in hell he turned he turned in hell he said who's here Jesus say I'm here I'm here because you're here I shall never leave you am never forsake you there is no way you can go where the presence of the Lord is not there amen he said but God was with him and did what deliver him out of all his what God never took the Affliction away God didn't take the Affliction away God left the Affliction and then he came and delivered him out of the Affliction you have to be in the Affliction then God take you out of the Affliction am now your view of Christianity is changing deliver him out of what h how many Affliction all of his Affliction is there any exception all afflictions every one of them God comes and remove it amen amen amen amen am he happen a lot to the righteous but the Lord deliver him out of them no exception amen but God let you go through it why he says and deliver him out of all his Affliction after the deliverance from Affliction Kama and gave him what favor and what and wisdom in the sight of who Pharaoh king of Egypt and made him what governor over Egypt and all his house so after the Deliverance you see what is coming up you are moving from Affliction to governing amen amen amen no pain no Easter amen you remember that right amen no Affliction no Easter one more 1 Peter chapter 5 then we pray and so First Peter chapter 5 the weather is good no earthquake on the airport no delay of a flight all his work 1 Peter chap 5 verse 10 very familiar scripture but the God of all Grace not just the God but the God of all Grace of all Capstone who has called us to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus Jesus you have been called to the glory not just the moment Glory but the eternal glory Karma after that you have what suffered a while so you must suffer for some time amen why that suffering amen amen after you have suffered a while for a period of time come make you happy how perfect so what makes you perfect then the suffering fire makes you good amen he cooked the meat well amen so suffering brings what Perfection it means somebody was not perfect before amen he was still wrong but he got potential so they have to cook turn the oven on and you turn into something really really delicious amen after you have suffered make you what perfect and what establish and what strengthen and what and settled suffering bring all of this no suffering you not settled no suffering you not strengthen no suffering you not established no suffering you are not perfect amen so if means when you are born you have raw material you got resources in the ground too many natural resources when you are born you got a package you got a land your land is filled with a lot of stuff amen and the devil knows it amen that's why from your youth the devil attack you amen amen so now God need to bring some machinery and put them there so that they can begin to draw the natural resources and use it up for your development amen Amen brother Bram say Indian is filled with natural resources but they don't have the mantality to develop it amen they taught them how to beg right I have the cat I have plenty of them maybe four or five I can load you with it okay don't worry leave the Indian alone amen so it's roow natural resources God bring an industry right there amen amen and that industry need to come and take and dig and cut the trees and remove the tree and prospector and everything dig it and remove it but when they turn everything out then the country begin to Blossom then the land begin to change then we can put some road we can put some light we can put we can build some buildings and everything but it takes some industry amen it takes some work amen amen to transform your natural resources into a spot where they are useful amen if not you will be only telling dreams that's right that's right but in Egypt you are interpreting dream in Israel you're only telling dreams in Egypt you become a useful tool Amen to decode dreams amen and when you decoded there is a result that happen but you must be hated by somebody you got you must be sold by someone and taken somewhere we clear let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you again humbly this morning Father we thank you for your grace for your love and your mercy father and for everything you have been doing for us Lord thank you for this wonderful beautiful day outside that you have given us Lord father this is as far as I can go with the ability you have given me when it comes to teach to preach or to interpret your word he only take the action of the holy spirit because we are insufficient completely and you T us through your Prophet to master the human element father may you come and move me aside may you be the one Speaking the one hearing and the one opening your word may you start with us and finish it and remove everything that is coming from the world of Darkness touch those that are sick and Changers Lord father as we stay focused to hear from thee in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen praise God my subject this morning is our were journey through Joseph five garments part six the number of a man six is the number of a man right you know the numerology amen amen we know that our key scripture is Romans chapter 8 verse 28 the bible say that we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose whether it's good good or whether it's bad everything is working together for good amen praise him you know that you should do amen everything is working together for good there is no reason that you can bring never ever to stop praising the Lord everything will work together for good even though now it doesn't look like it's going to work together for good at the end of the day it will work together for good amen amen with our far government the first one was a coat of many colors and the second one which we are entering already it is the quat of a servant or a slave we clear the third one is a coat of what a prisoner and the fourth one is what appearing before Pharaoh amen amen before pharaoh and the last one is what is is the quat of fine larning amen amen which is the righteousness of the Saints amen amen every single quat represent a stage it represent a step it represent a level it represent a category or it represent a period of time and you got to move from one to another from one to another until you reach the Throne of egyp eypt are we together amen these steps are very important missing one will cause you trouble skipping one will cause you trouble neglecting one will cause you trouble am William Marion Branham brother Branham says this in the message the Palma wors the Locust the canker room and the caterpillar he says these insect if you get your book of in of insect you shall notice that that four different insect is the same self Instinct in four different stages of its life all of us know that a cocoon is nothing but a water a caterpillar covered over it's going to hatch out to a water butterfly so we going toward the butterfly amen but every step is important amen are we together amen he says and a butterfly is a what caterpillar before he does what hatches out so the Palmer the Locust and the so forth is what the same it is the same what and every step make way to another amen let's go to the book of joob G j o e l The Book of Joel even in Christ sanctification Make Way justification make way and sanctification make way and the baptism of the Holy Ghost make way to the Holy Ghost himself so no justification you causing trouble to sanctification amen amen if the life is not Sanctified you put the Holy Ghost it's a trouble let's go to the book of Joe Joe is where you see the prophet Hosea all of them it's the little tiny tiny books there that's where you find Jo go to Jeremiah pass Jeremiah Avenue then you go you will see Hosea and Hosea you go you Lan you will see you'll see Jo somewhere amen Joe chapter 1 let's go to verse uh four if you dare the Bible says that th which the what the Palmer worm has what has left has the what Locust eaten so the Palmer worm leave something for the Locust amen are we together amen what the Palam left that's what the Locust take over the Locust doesn't come before he need to wait for the palor to do the work then the Locust take it amen verse four again and that which the Locust has what left has the what canor eaten and that which the canor has left has what the caterpillar eaten and look at verse chapter 2 verse 25 how it's going to shock you if you dare you can say amen amen and I will restore to you amen the years that the W the Locust have eaten the what the Locust and then the conkeror and then and the caterpillar and then and the Palmer worm my what my great Army the army of who of God am God sent that Army to destroy the vine and that army goes with step amen and every step of that de devilish Army is important it's making way to [Music] another are we together so if you miss one step here you're going to get in trouble right that's right William Maran Branham brother Branham say yesterday standing in the backyard of my sister that live next door to us sister wood we was noticing a little cocoon that had form on a tree and the wind was blowing it back and forth they see a cocon moving on Amen and she was was telling it that in the streams of the desert I believe that she was reading an article about the Cocoon it's a little worm that goes in there and form a little shell around him to keep through the water cold so the cocon is important it's a protection through the cold weather but when he comes time I'm going to continue on the next one brother brandham say this person who was reading who was dealing with the little fellow they seen the little cocon and moving and wiggling around with the wind and they felt so sorry for the little fellow so they thought they would just cut the end of it of our lovely compassion Beyond God's compassion because sometime we love people more than God when God is whooping them we love them until you will love the devil amen amen the devil won't be converted no matter how much you pray for him amen it amen and he said and they felt so sorry for the little fellow so they thought that they would just cut the end of it off and let the little bag what out because when he comes out there he was going to have what Wings he went in as a water above or a water a little water and he comes out with water with wing you go out as a slave uh-huh but you come out as a governor amen every step is important amen amen he comes out with wings in a more like what a glorified state so what you see as a bag is in the process toward glorification amen am are we together and as he was wiggling and pulling and tagging and beaing and biting they saw this little fellow just struggling and trying to get out of the cocon they felt so so they felt sorry for him so they thought they would just give him what a shortcut they would just skip a step so they go get a what scissors and cut the end of it and when they cut the end of it the little bag did what come out but he never was right amen Lord because he didn't have any strength in what his body he could not use what his wing and I'm afraid this is what happened in message churches we miss so many steps and we got trouble makers in the church amen we got people that cannot fly right because they gave them a shortcut wow every step every government is important amen if you miss one step you're going to cause trouble amen if you miss one step you won't come out right you can be well done but if they put you in the mouth you don't have seasoning amen you taste like a [Music] pepper because you are not seasoned right they should have given time for the seasoning to penetrate the meat amen hallelujah hallelujah glory to God brother Bram continue he say I think that is the way we try to do what to duplicate and say get down to the Altar and say this and that or the other and try to do what get the people back to God or into the what the church or come to what Christ just let them do what who who it out that's all just do what work your way out of it that so if you try to give them a what a shortcut shall never be able to stand amen that's why I cannot back up from this message I want to make sure you are built well amen and you can stand the test that is coming up on your own amen whether I'm there or not you can stand the devil face the devil and handle the devil yourself amen but if we misstep to please you you will never call me a hypocrite my friend because I'm trying to do my job amen if you try to give them a what they shall never be able to do what I just like to see them what struggle and what and work at it and work at it till God do what gives them a real birth in the water natural way just give them what the real bir if they have to cry let them cry amen if they have to stay in church who will give you the alarm code you stay here in the church we go home you you stay here until God fills you [Laughter] amen people say well honey I think you are what pray enough who are you to stop somebody from praying you pray too much down you can go home the Lord heard your prayer no no no no let them work it out let them sweat it out if you give them a shortcut they have not have the character yet give a child money all the time you sping them amen let them go work amen let them spend some hour at work when their back hurt they know how to spend the [Music] money can you say amen amen brother Bram say you just stay there until you are what ready to fly that is the only thing God has a way of what of doing oh well if you want to be good just go over and do what join the church Mama went to the what same church that might be just fun but you know it takes what a death to bring what a life and we got to do what to die until we are so dead that there can be a what a new life come in then our wing will be what valuable our experience that we have will be what valuable to who others and to who our now Joseph you can help the family amen you can protect the land because your wings are valuable now but if you miss the step you're going to get in trouble glory to God everybody okay my engine is still going this way so keep your seat belt as we going up amen amen amen we found out last Sunday that Joseph had got his coat taken off but he was never lost he was sent back to his father to the original owner so no matter what the devil is doing you won't lose anything brother Bram wife was talking to him about his bhead that brother Bram I don't see here brother Bram said I have not lost one of them because God knows even the number of your hand am he goes back to the original honor glory glory glory glory glory let's go to Genesis 37 where we were every garment is important every every step is important if you miss it you get in trouble amen and hopefully by the grace of God you will discover why we struggle in this message yes sir because people miss this step don't worry my friend just give me my time you will see you will understand the behavior of people why they struggle amen am let's go to Genesis 37 if you dare you you can say amen amen you remember last Sunday he was sold you know the Easter package was given to him Resurrection death burial Resurrection going to the Gentile verse 36 and the median sold him into Egypt whoer you understand this now right the median I'm going to answer a question and answer right here the medanite sold him into Egypt to Piper an officer of pharaoh and captain of the Guard we found out last Sunday that pipar was a military man so they put Joseph under a military supervisor in a boook camp amen if you notice verse 37 is finished Joseph is going to the Gentile Christ going to the Gentile amen watch verse 38 chapter 38 I'm sorry the Bible says and it came to pass at that time that who that Judah went down from what his Judah also separate [Music] himself from his brother going where to the Gentile that's right you read your Bible right Judas separate himself from the brother and turned into a c into a certain What aite whose name was what and Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite amen whose name was shua and he took her and went into her and this woman conceive so Judah went and marri a gentile woman and this is where t is introduced so when Joseph is going into Egypt Judah goes into the Gentile to pick up a wife showing you that Christ also Joseph is going to go to Egypt to marry a gentile woman but Judah being the king have to open up the septer it is the mathematics of the bible [Applause] hallu let me show you how strange it is okay you got time right let's go to verse 36 verse 36 and the medion sold who him into Egypt to whoer an officer of pharaoh and and captain of the Guard then chapter 38 right let's go to chapter 39 verse 1 if you thereare you can say amen amen and Joseph was brought down to Egypt and Piper an officer of pharaoh captain of of the god an Egyptian brought him bought him out of the hand of the who the Israelites over there he say median over here is so Med and is is what okay is which brought him down what stop verse one here and verse 36 do you see any difference it's it's the same thing the difference is this is medidan this is ishma but it's talking about the same story they sold him to Egypt to Piper They sold him to Egypt to Piper but in between sold him to Egypt to Piper and sold him to Egypt to Piper verse 38 enter with Judah going to marage genter so Judah entered there separating the two verses to show you that Christ now is going to the Gentile to marry a gentile woman and Judas separate himself also from his brother amen going into the Gent and that's where Tamar was introduced am in the lineage of Jesus Christ amen that's the story of tar Tamar enter into the lineage of Jesus Christ in between the two selling of [Applause] Joseph are we together are we together all I'm trying to show you is Judah is also reflecting something that's going to happen to Joseph in Egypt because Joseph marri a gentile woman in Egyptian and brother Bram say that's the top of the Brad showing that cross we go get a gentile woman a gentile wife are we together amen are we together amen we clear there amen now we on 309 the Bible says he went and he was sold over there amen amen now we found out that he left a good home where he was loved for from Mama and Daddy everybody car for him except his brother full freedom and everything God transfer him from that home automatically down to a boot camp amen amen and we found out that behind all of that God was there amen you remember last Sunday because Joseph told them it is God that sent me here not you amen amen now let's clim on this one brother Bram says this a reminder sometime you have to do what separate from everything that is what dear on Earth to you to take your position that God has what called you to so the separation is going onto a position amen that's right amen you're not just separating and you stuck right there no they are separating you toward a position toward your destiny amen everybody okay I'm sure you can read between the line what I'm saying some D the very what dearest person on earth like Joseph his mother his father you have to do what shake hands with them he didn't even have time to shake hand and take your position in what Christ to where God has what but what is God doing why this separation why this heartache this disappointment brother brandham say God is transforming you from what what you was may be a what a daughter and or a son or whatever it is from a lovely family sometime he places you somewhere else because it is his way of what doing it by the what renewing of your mind to obey the word of God regardless of the price amen so the moving have a purpose it is just bringing you towards your destiny or towards your position and the same thing happened to Jesus Christ amen this is where we stop on Sunday last Sunday brother John says in U in uh chapter 12: 23 and Jesus answered them saying the hour is what is come that the son of man should be what glorified amen as a butterfly verily verily I say unto you except what corn of wheat fall into the water the ground alone as long as Jesus remain alone you won't see the potential of Jesus you will not know that Jesus can multiply amen amen that's why he said it is even better for me to go amen because if I stay here the Comfort they won't come I am blocking the Holy Spirit I must go so I can release the spirit back again everybody okay he said if but if he dies which is bad to us he brings forth what much fruit so what do you want do you want much fruit or you want to remain with glorification take death amen it takes suffering it takes beaing a it takes rejection am it takes forse accusation am but it's bringing you to a position Amen brother Bram say if I had a handful of wheat laying here on my hand in my hand and lay it on the on this desk it would what never be nothing but what wheat laying there but plant that wheat in the ground it shall produce maybe what a bushel of wheat in other words that wheat got wheat inside amen as small as the wheat look like have you seen a o tree seed it might be this small but he can bring a big tree so don't look at your SS amen don't look how small you are how insignificant you are you can be turned to a big tree amen amen because the problem is what is inside the natural resources that are inside is what determine the value of the land a land might look good but there is nothing under nobody want it but if there is resources everybody will fight for it because they are looking for resources but the germ of life that is in the wheat but the wit has to fall where into the ground and do what and die Jesus say I believe say accept a corn of whe fall into the ground and die it does what so it's necessary to go through this process in order to bring forth your potential or to bring you to the position that God want you to be Amen in Luke Chapter 24:25 the Bible said then he said unto them on the road to emay oh fools and slow of heart to do what to believe all that the prophet has what have spoken ought not Christ have to do what suffer these things to enter into what his glory so to enter into Glory Christ must suffer amen if there is no suffering no glory amen no persecution no glory am no removal of M no glory am no trouble no you miss that step you're going to cause trouble down the [Music] road are we together amen are we together Amen brother Bram say neither can he take you or can he take me the devil until the purpose of God of our life is what finished so we gather from there what consolation and why does God let trouble come William Marion Bram God harness what trouble and put bits in its what mouth and make it do what obey him and those trouble bring us into a what a closer fellowship with God those trouble you going through God is using that negative energy and beat and put a bit on them in other words God use it am as a fuel to take you to your position amen so when you see how they coming in your life just know you got gasoline amen it is time to fill your tank amen because you moving towards your destination it is not a trouble to sink you down but God harest that use this that in order to bring you somewhere don't worry my friend we still claming brother brandham say we found that rain which bring forth what fruit upon the Earth it is what it's born that's what we say oh look at the grass the grass just came out as the poet said in the field of what of thunder in a water in a ragged and a what jaged Skies you don't you don't look at that one you look at the grass that came out you forget that the tunder

will not what be born he takes that what lightning it takes what Thunder blast it takes what Rag and what rugged and what fearful things to bring forth the soft pedal drops of water it takes pain amen amen to bring forth what birth it takes what dying as the cloud dies rain is what is born because rain is a part of what that CL one has to see so the other can do what your pain is brething something in you am your trial is brething something in you some of you will never be straight until you go through a hard trial amen then you recalibrate your life let your wife get sick you will appreciate

begin to appreciate her presence you begin to appreciate her food and everything because you going through pain amen you thought you going to make it with fast food it's not working fast food don't

kitchen looks so clean because no one is there you will appreciate that it takes that to bring that birth so you can see your wife in the new eye so you can see your husband in the new eye when you begin to work third shift you will remember your [Applause] husband I'm a pastor so sometime I have to drop those Avenue amen amen amen Amen brother Bram say you got to you you got something to do God got something for you to do you may have some what some heartache and what and some trouble you may have some what some disappointment but we but do we pray to sh them no Lord take me what through them not AR them you got to go through them whatever they is whatever it is don't let me what Escape them in other way don't Dodge your trial [Music] amen don't worry my friend don't let me what Escape them if they are set for for me for me just give me what Grace to do what to go through that amen because they are important for your moving amen so if you dodge them you are losing an important energy amen if they set for you take it amen put it under you and you will see how they're going to lift you up amen hallu it's a different level my friend we moving good glory to God listen to this my friend brother Bram say we ask for what comfort and what andace God give us the best he could give us which is what trials and tribulations it's on the board it is on the board Lord I want to have peace all around me God say I'm going to give you something better what is it oh father thank you for the peace you're giving me trouble tribulation get it but God is using that amen and your trouble is already measured according to your category amen it is never beyond your category that's why you don't Dodge them he help you develop muscles amen no fight no muscle amen are we together he said we ask for the God is giving us the best he can give us which is what trials and what and tribulations that is the that is better than what than comfort and and what do you know why people love the because they can be laying on the bed and somebody's ringing the dog and they're bringing breakfast when you on the bed but a whole Mama come and pull the sheat and say get out if you bring food to the bedroom they say get that food out over there it is better than Comfort it is better than comfort in can I continue it's a pastorial my friend he said that is better than what comfort and what and peace our comfort is just what beyond the river it was until the Hebrew children was what fored into the what fiery furnace on one of the most what outstand this trial D they are seen one like what the Son of God what standing among them in other word without that trial they will have never had the opportunity to see God in the face amen amen amen it looks like it's a trial but God used that opportunity that they can see God not imaginary God they can talk with God and if you notice they weren't bound and do you know what the fire only did the fire knew the difference between their body and the B the fire just remove the B and give them a fellowship so your trial is bringing Deliverance amen your trial won't burn you the Bible say say not even a smell of a smoke don't worry my friend that Tri you going to come out without a scratch but you will be better than before the trium people will respect you better than before the Triumph imagine imagine those four Hebrew when they came out from the furnace people look at them like Angels their Fame is going everywhere people say oh this fire can do nothing to them don't touch them don't touch them these are Untouchable because we turn the fire seven time had and it's not working on them what else can you do to destroy them he Tau even the government how to respect them amen amen amen your trial is bringing exceedingly and abundantly above what you can think amen it look bad now but just give it some time amen and you will see the result of that trial because it's the best God gave you hallah are we together are we together are we together in the back glory to God brother Bram say their trouble produce what the Son of God standing what among them they didn't say their praises even even though the Praises can bring the Son of God but this trial produce God the trial produce the Son of God in the midst of them brother Bram say that trouble produce what the Son of God standing where among them in the water thees to wave away the what the heat wave but not until they went into the what the fire did that comfor what he won't appear until the trial comes am because he uses trial he uses trouble he h when trouble is coming he said that's my ingredient now am amen amen everything is working together for what listen to this my friend what is going on with this garment this garment that we talking about the Garment of a servant or a slave amen amen amen amen amen Joseph is called Perfection and we found out that his Blessing are bigger his Blessing is greater than Jacob greater than Isaac greater than even Abraham and Joseph himself T Perfection what are you trying to say brother Bram is saying this in the Masterpiece he said Abraham was the foundation of Faith let's say he had four foundations the foundation of Faith was who Abraham the foundation of love was who Isaac the foundation of Grace was who Jacob God's grace to Jacob anyone knows that but in Joseph was what Perfection there is there is where he could set the monument amen as much as the Masterpiece as Abraham look like the father of our faith when God look at Abraham he said I cannot position the building over here he look at Isaac Isaac is a top of love he look he say no no I cannot put this building right here I'm reading brother BR he look at Jacob oh this is Grace the grace of Lord God everything he said I cannot position my building here I can only put my building only on Joseph all of them don't qualify to be the Masterpiece of God and brother Bram say upon none not the First Foundation Abraham not the second foundation not the third but upon what fourth foundation so this boy have to be a masterpiece in other word when you see Joseph you must see Perfection when you when God see you people see you they must see Perfection amen God could not give it to Paul because Paul say when that which is perfect will come he knew he was not in his day all the messenger god could not give it all the believer throughout the edes Ephesus Pam God say I cannot put the Capstone there but when God saw you God said this is where I can position the in know the word God has the greatest message of all he look at PA he say I can't give it to Paul I can't give it to Peter I can't give it to none of them I can't give it to Lu I won't give it to Wesley when God look at you he said this one I can give him this message amen so God qualify you for Perfection amen hallelujah amen your blessing are higher amen higher than any age higher than even Paul am that's why brother Bram say we now returning to pen we are even higher than P God trusted you not Paul not Peter am who here walk on the Water Peter did God say I won't give it to Peter Peter don't qualify for this he qualify for whatever is there but the last stage when God was selecting he look at this this one he say you in Spa you in pergamus you he look at them [Music] epes sis Philadelphia brother logos the devil say not him he said do you know what is in this boy have you seen what is in this Bo what I see you don't see amen she said the devil say not you God look he said do you see what is in this girl the devil said put him on the other he said no put him on the first he said no the second he said no the third he said no he said which he said the last one because this is the cream of the coven all the fullness of the godhead every Seal have to be broken to you not to fall not to L not to wle not to col only you you are bigger than you think amen you are precious in the hand of God Amen you got [Applause] perfect [Applause] hallu you remember this right this is not Perfection but this one is perfection when this one come he makes this a pyramid if you remove this this is no longer a pyramid so to deposit this one only you can get it they without you cannot be made perfect they s in the sixth Dimension they are waiting for you as long as you not born again yet they are all waiting over there hurry up hurry up fix your life you're the one waiting I mean fix your life we need to see Jesus brother Bram said Jesus was not there he was higher than [Applause] them so until you get to position they will stay there until so your peace is important you the one that sealed the puzzle without you no rupture without you no Resurrection hu let me say it this way without that you know another Easter you the Easter of the ENT time the rising of the sun if you are Perfection what does he mean if your blessing is so big that God have to entrusted you with such a great message that everybody even John one right they say don't touch that he said but father I heard it he say see you later it's not for you it is for brother Greg it is for brother Michael it is for sister Divine it is for sister K it is for Sister Sarah don't stand there don't stand there are not for you they are for the end [Applause] time are we together I won't tell you about the time you know amen amen so we found that the foundation cannot be placed to any of them only Joseph the Capstone cannot be put to any of the people only you in the end time amen amen Perfection Joseph what El James says about perfection James says this he said my brethren count it what all joy when you fell into what diverse Temptation knowing this am so when you fall in Temptation James say begin to Rejoice with this Revelation what is the Revelation knowing this that the what the trying of your faith are they trying you are they trying you they are trying what so before the trial come there is a faith [Applause] there so the devil is testing their faith when Jesus received the Holy Ghost the devil came to test and he and he felt something he goes like say okay this is not Daniel Amen he said that the trial of what your faith do what work is patience but let patient have what her perfect work that he may be how perfect an entire wanting what nothing in other words let it finish its work Amen Let the Fire cook you well amen then you will reach a point where you don't need anything amen because anything you need of is already in you [Applause] amen even if there is no Square you can create one [Applause] amen glory to God they are selling him going to Egypt when we look at Egypt here we say okay his brother saw him he's going to Egypt look before Egypt what has Egypt represent the Bible says this glory to God that in uh Genesis 43 and they set on him for uh they set on for him by himself this is Joseph they give him food himself and for and for them by themselves his brother alone and for the Egyptian which did it with him by what so when Joseph gave a banquet to his brother they took Joseph over there food there the Hebrew over there the Egyptian over there everybody in their own spot why because the what Egyptians man not eat bread with what the Hebrews for that is a what an Abomination unto what to the Egyptians so when they are sending Joseph to Egypt he's going into a land where he's seen as an Abomination can I continue verse uh 34 and 46 that ye shall say this is Joseph telling his father that servant trade has been about the cattle from one youth his scratch even until now both we and also our father that he may dwell in the land of what for every Shepherd is an abomination unto what the Egyptians so Joseph number one is strip of every right he's not going there as a free man no he's going there as a slave or a servant in other word he have no right amen and not only does he have no right but he's going in a land where his race is seen as a lower race as an abomination in other word when he enter Egypt people are looking at him like the god of paradox am how can an Abomination become a governor of land an Abomination now become the governor of the land when they were giving him all the T they forgot about his Abomination Pharaoh forgot about everything because when God times come amen am all the exception are removed amen it's a god of a paradox your destiny can be beyond your [Applause] brain what God wants you to be can be beyond your PR amen you are completely disqualified you are unqualified that's when God Work [Applause] am and who bought him an officer of pharaoh how can an officer of pharaoh get an Abomination into his house are we together are we together let's look at this servant my friend brother Bram say when Joseph was in prison that was who Jesus when he was sought for pretty near 30 pieces of silver that was who that was Jesus when he was made ptif for man that was who Jesus so Joseph being a servant to P was Jesus how can he be Jesus as a slave on brother amen are we together are we together are we together listen to brother uh uh Psalm 105 the Bible says in 1075 verse1 17 he sent a man before them even who Joseph who was sold for what a servant so Joseph left the coat of many colors now he sent as a servant but not truly a servant the way we think he was sold with a price so he was a servant as a slave this is why brother bradam says this he said that is hard but we are what slaves and we want to serve him all the days of what our life a slave is a servant in order to be a slave of Jesus Christ you have to be slave to yourself to crucify oh God let it sink in crucify yourself and your flesh and your desire that God might take hold of your what to move you and to do what motivate you that is the slave of who of Christ the born slave called Paul Paul call it he said he was a slave to the Lord who Jesus a born slave in the service for the Lord Jesus going about daily doing what crucifying the flesh to be a slave for Jesus Christ rejoicing because he was a what slave when we talking about a slave in laia this is a big problem this government here is a big problem for laition because this government remove every right that you have this government here remove every privilege that you have they don't even consider you as a human being you are seen as an Abomination but you are crushed as a [Applause] slave everybody together brother Bram said the name laish which means what people's rights was very common and was given to several City in honor of the royal lady son name notice the name laia which is what the people's right or what Justice of the people was there ever an age like the 20th century churches that have seen all Nation doing what rising up and demanding what equality and what social and what Financial the word laia means people's right but the government of a slave prisoner take your right away so now the spirit of the age is fighting the process of God God want to strip you from everything but want to give you your right want you to fight I'm in a meat now in the Deep surgery and you going to see the problem in the message this is where people have a trouble in this message they cannot tolerate their right be taken off that's right that's right amen amen they claiming the right all the time got a right to say what I want I got a right to express you mind God is removing all of [Applause] that your desire is py your desire is portify amen your food is py amen your agenda is portify amen your project is py Project you have no project [Applause] amen when you wake up in the morning you don't have no plan you got py plan what py want to do today if I say you go to one you're not going to Target because you have no choice this is where young people get in trouble it's a garment that prepare you first to live under Authority it is a garment that put restriction and bring you down so that you might learn how to obey [Applause] order God give brother Bram in order go preach somewh and his mother-in-law said don't go preach somewh God say let me teach you who's the boss God took his wife took his baby and put them in the sixth Dimension go again tell brother Bram not to go where God want him to go because William BR you must follow my not your mother in Lord it's a garment that God strip you from right are we together are we together will you love me will you love me will you love me this garment is a tough one listen to what brother brandham say Lord help me he said another thing there the lamb is the Lamb is willing to do what to God want us to be what but there is so many times that we want we don't want to do what submit our right forfeit what all right so many of you say well I got right brother BR that is what true but you are are you willing to fulfill your right are you willing to give your right that God could do what lead you that what they matter with what our churches today in the great what majority that the gentleness of what the Lamb of God we are supposed to be what but we have become everything else but what that is the reason as soon as we get what that attitude the dove of the Holy Spirit do what takes her flight and leaves remember every step is necessary amen you need to go through the boot camp amen because your package is big amen they got to structure your mind amen they got to renew your mind am am are you following me amen are you following me amen look on verse uh we on 39 let's go to verse two my friend oh my God if you thereare you can say Amen verse two Genesis 39 you there amen and the Lord was with who Joseph and he was what a prosperous man and he was in the house of what his master the Egyptian and his master so that the Lord was what with him and the Lord made all that he did do what to prosper in his hand and Joseph found Grace in the what in his sight and he did what and he served him a servant a servant he served him you there amen and he made him what overseer over his house and all that he had he put where into his hand so this boy begin to grow under this ministry and he got a big position why is not God taking him directly to the throne are we together let's start from the origin according to the origin Joseph got two dreams we together according to buff dream he was on a on a position of authority amen of position of authority of dominion a position to Reign or to rule amen amen everybody bowing down he's standing in the Zodiac everybody's that bowing down he's standing so automatically from the beginning there is a destiny to power that's right that's right there is a destiny to a throne there is a destiny to a higher position that everybody will bow down but to get to that Destiny you need to go through this manle why do you follow me go to Genesis 37 let's see where he started Genesis 37:2 we're moving pretty good my friend you there Genesis 37:2 these are the generation of Jacob Joseph being 17 years old was feeding the flock he was in charge with his Brethren and the lad was with the sons of Bah and with the sons of zela his father's wife and Joseph brought to his father the what evil report so from his youth he was a small manager is my Bible different he was already supervising and watching the flock and going and bringing report can I continue can I continue amen jump to verse 14 amen and he said him verse 14 go I pray you see whether he be well with your who thy bre so his brother was there feeding the flock but his father kept the supervisor home he said I got a mission for you supervisor come here he say yes Daddy what can I do he said take the car take the mule over there uh I already filled the tank over there go ahead and go give me a report again of your brother situation so this didn't start in P for he started from his childhood are we together that position of authority was already bleeding through his childhood of responsibility but the responsibility of Egypt is bigger are we together that's why David have to keep the flock because he have to Shepherd Israel so they have to train him under the flock to defend the flock to fight for the flock then God never move him to a kingship he move him under s to learn obedience before you go to the throne from the flock to sa from s then you become the king are we together are we together verse 14 and he said to him go I pray thee whether see whether he be well with your brethren and well with the what so go see the employee and go also check the the business and look at everything come there ask them how many sheep did you how many

Bram say we know that in this last day that what is going to take this in the last day what is going to take to stand is a scripture train Church on the line for there is going to be what caral impersonations rise you got to be trained right if you miss that training you're going to get trouble down the river brother Bram say the Bible says as gen and G with stood so will this man of repr man concerning the truth Jesus was the truth the word that word is the truth in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was made flesh and dwell Among Us the word of God is more powerful than a two-edged sword cutting a center of the Bor and the discerner of the thoughts of the heart we realize that we are living in that day that where anything can look what so real but yet it is what of the scripture leave it alone no matter what kind of what s what result you found out of it if it's not what stay away from what stay right with the what you got to be trained right why are you saying this a servant is an important position Jesus say himself that verily verily I say unto you the servant is what not greater than his Lord neither is he that sent greater than what he that sent him so they have to put you under their lower position I'm going to show you this in the life of Jesus Christ then I'm going to head to the airport quick he says the disciple is not above his master no the servant above what Lord the disciple is not above his master but everyone that is how perfect Joseph shall be as what his master so to be like your master you got to be perfect but to go through Perfection you must be trained amen if you miss that training you in trouble even even Jesus Christ train his disciple that's right before they get the Holy Ghost and begin to work without Jesus being present listen to this my friend Jesus said this in Matthew 25 his Lord say unto him well done good and what faithful servant faithful boss no faithful boss no faithful what servant you got to be a servant that is faithful and good that has been faithful of a what a few things I will make the ruler of what many things before you be ruler of many you got to be faithful on the little thing you got to be faithful in the house of Piper amen before you can inherit something big that's why people hit the lottery tomorrow they broke because they got the money without the car am I wish I have time my friend I wish I had time my friend then he came to the first saying Lord that pound has gained what 10 pound and he says unto him well that good what servant he learned how to draw interest because that has been faithful in a what a very little that have what authority over 10 cities not ruler authority over what before you can have authority over tens City you got to prove yourself from the little one that you get he that is faithful in that which is what least is faithful also in what so in other words if you are not going through this garment and you got to stay under this government and fight the correct way if you are not faithful here no matter how many churches you change you're going to fail all it takes is a matter of time you'll be in trouble again and this pastor is wrong that Pastor is wrong that Pastor is wrong that it's not Pastor you don't understand what God is doing and you won't move forward until you cross that garment amen everybody okay let me finish my friend even Jesus Christ himself was a servant am the Bible say in Matthew 12:1 15 we found out that he was what Jehovah's servant behold my what servant in whom I'm well pleased it is in Matthew 12 over there behold my servant whom I have what my beloved in whom my soul is what I will put my spirit upon him and he shall show judgment to who the Gentiles Jesus himself was a servant brother brandham said now if we could only do that to identify our life see our life to be identify as what Jehovah's servant that is what frankincense was that was him what made him Jehovah's servant Jesus was the king he was the god that was in heaven follow me carefully because I'm finishing with this Jesus was the god that was in heaven amen amen amen to give Jesus the glory that he had after Easter amen God took Jesus in heaven with a Coat of Many Colors because he had a rainbow in heaven in Jesus in in heaven Jesus had a rainbow in heaven brother brandham said that was his quat of Many Colors God stri him from that amen and he condescended God to become a human being and to become a servant to Jehovah right so Jesus have to [Music] [Applause] learn do you follow me amen do you follow me amen do you follow me amen Jesus left the court of many color he left the glory he left the angel and he was born in a manger the god that created heaven and earth is walking in a man of 200b yes amen and he become the Son of God God become a son and he remove all the right of the godship follow me carefully follow me carefully I'm about to drop the airport that's why Jesus said my father is greater than me because he was made lower than angel am let's go to Philippian 2 and I finish let's go to Philippian 2 and I finish my friend oh God I will come back to this mental Philippians chapter 2 and then we finish here few minute and I'm done you there you there are you there amen Philippians 2 verse5 you there this Garment of a servant let this mind be what in you Hallelujah you there which was also what in Christ Jesus God want you to think like Jesus amen to reason like Jesus to dream like Jesus but can you please give me an example can you give me a clue of this man how was that mind that you talking about you say that get the mind in Christ in you I want to know how was the mind of that Christ you following me the Bible say who being in the form of what God remember that Mentor you don't lose it the mental of Many Colors he's still God Amen but they have to take it away and let him cry like a baby how can God cry like a baby brother Bram say he was Jehovah crying are you there he says and who being in the form of God Tau it not what robbery to be what equal him and God same that was his man but look what happened now verse seven but was made but made himself of what of no reputation and took upon him the form of the form of a what servant look at the board he took upon him the form of a what servant am Jesus becoming a servant amen he took the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of what man now he became like a slave amen amen amen amen and being found in the fashion of a what as a man he humble himself and became what obedient to what unto in other words father look at him and get God show him P say this is my agenda Jesus say this is my agenda that's right the agenda of Piper you must die on the cross of Calvary the other agenda I don't want to leave my friend this been with me too much look at the son learning obedience he said nevertheless when I came here I don't have no right it is not my will it is your will that I came to fulfill here nevertheless not my will but thy will be done if you mean Calvary that's what I go through Jesus learn obedience Jesus became a servant from a court of many color of a rainbow all the way down to a court of servant he says and he become obedient to the death even the death of what cross even the death of the Cross full stop verse 9 where fall because he passed the boot camp amen because he learned to be obedient amen because he understand to respect his mentorship Amen to respect the Deacon Amen to respect the trustee to respect Mama to respect Daddy because you learn to respect even your boss work amen the Bible say even if your boss is mean it's written in the Bible because you learn that when Jesus Crist when he graduated from that verse n wherefore God God has whated highly exalted him and give him a what name which is a of what every name that name you get it after you pass the test am remember Joseph when he came out from here when they sound the trumpet what happened every knee was doing what look at Jesus Christ himself he said he give him a name which is above what every name that at the name of what of Jesus every knee should do what should bow and of of the things which are where in heaven and the things which are where in Earth and the things which are where under and that every tongue should what confess God will force you to confess amen even his enemy said truly this is the Son of God even the one who's crucifying you if you pass this test they will speak and say truly this is a Christian amen this woman is a Christian I I treated him bad I treated her bad but this is a true Christian if you want to see a message believe it that's you because you crossed the path he says and Jesus Christ that should confess that Jesus Christ is the Lord to the glory of who God the Father why he passed the test of a servant I have not finished I'm going to close here look at what God did to Jesus go to Ephesian one few chapter and that's it Ephesians chapter one let me leave you with Ephesian 1 Ephesian 1 verse 20 uh verse 19 three verses are you there and what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us toward us word who believe according to the working of his what Mighty power which he wrote In Christ he did it first in Jesus when he did what raised him from the dead Easter and set him at his what own right hand in the Heavenly in the in the Heavenly places far above what all look at the position Jesus received after he became obedient to The Obedience of the death of Calvary at the cross he said he rose him far above what all principality and what and power and what and might and what and dominion and what and every name that is named not only in what this world but also what in that which is to come in other words no matter which name you going to come up with no name will be like the name of Jesus Christ that's why the new name of God cannot be different than Jesus Christ I'm preaching a Doctrine right now I just drop that atomic bomb I just Dro that atomic bomb that's why when they say God he will have a new name don't think he will be different than Jesus Christ because even in the word to come the name of Jesus Christ always on the top why he obeyed the house of pipy one day we will preach on the new name of God we will teach on the new name of God he said even in the word to come and has put what all things under under his feet and gave him to be what the head over all things to which is what to the church Jesus went through this garment I told you before I will show you he became a servant and I'm going to show you Lord's willing how was he a servant and how Jesus was behaving as a servant as a slave it's a necessary but laish shall take your right off God wants you to be trained and I'm going to show you why the power that you have is dangerous amen your power is very dangerous you are too powerful than you think amen so they got to put you in P for house to structure you to prepare you in other word body for house is your tutorial it is your training it is your preparation towards your destiny if you miss that you're going to have a trouble that's why people in this message are full of themselves whatever they do is right in their own eyes their opinion is always right they have to express their mind all the time even if you give a quote they have a thought
