[2:58] thought so that's really good the Lord
[3:01] has asked for prayer already amen
[3:04] [Applause]
[3:08] she's very nervous about it and that's
[3:10] understandable so let's continue not

[3:45] the remainder of it I want to encourage
[3:47] as he's coming I've never considered
[3:51] myself a very very good song leader okay
[3:55] and with the congregation you know I
[4:00] want everyone to have an opportunity to
[4:04] sing I don't care what language if my
[4:08] wife wants to sing a song in Spanish we
[4:11] if we want to sing one in Lingala or
[4:13] French or Swahili I've sang one in I've
[4:18] sang one in Swahili myself so whatever
[4:23] if you have a song on your heart we want
[4:27] the joy the joy rejoice is beginning to
[4:30] return to this congregation two services
[4:32] ago and I wanted to increase and just
[4:34] magnify and just exceed anything that
[4:38] we've ever known I rejoice when I hear
[4:41] song that I don't even understand what
[4:42] the words are but I'm rejoicing because
[4:44] I
[4:45] see the joy and you know you get it but
[4:48] you get it because it's all about Jesus
[4:51] in him brother Robert come on up and
[4:53] pray brother deny it's good to see our
[5:00] heads in prayer dear God our Heavenly
[5:03] Father Lord Jesus Christ we are grateful
[5:07] to approach your holy throne of grace
[5:09] this morning Lord if there is a god when
[5:12] you only knew to be better than you we
[5:15] are not ashamed to say we could have
[5:16] gone to you by the reason we come to you
[5:19] is that we have known you to be the only
[5:21] God that is there is no other God Lord
[5:24] up from you you are the only one whom
[5:26] you have proved to be true over and over
[5:29] again Lord we have called you and the
[5:31] scene many times and they have showed
[5:33] yourself you have come Lord to our
[5:35] rescue you have come to our help Lord
[5:38] many times there's been so many
[5:40] situations that arise but whenever we
[5:43] have called up on that name we have
[5:45] always seen that it works
[5:47] Heavenly Father there could be places
[5:49] you could have been this morning but we
[5:52] chose to be here and the Lord we just
[5:54] kindly ask you not to disappoint us that

[6:33] going on some people could have lost
[6:35] jobs whatever the situation whatever the
[6:38] request is that we are bringing
[6:40] everything before your holy throne of
[6:42] grace may you grant it Lord as you see
[6:45] fit may you grant it Lord as their
[6:47] children are believing expecting law to

[7:03] the word may we have a receptive heart
[7:05] so that Lord we will all get a benefit
[7:09] from hearing your word we pray Lord you
[7:12] help us you even those who may not have
[7:15] been able to count by their watching
[7:17] virtually we pray a special blessing
[7:19] upon them also Lord we pray for all the
[7:22] members of the bride all across the
[7:24] world wherever they are knowing Lord
[7:27] that some so many of our fellow brothers
[7:29] and sisters we have been caught up and
[7:31] they've contracted this virus we are
[7:34] praying Lord that you intervene in a
[7:36] special way and help them father because
[7:39] you are the one who is more than able to
[7:41] speak it out of existence Lord the same
[7:44] way it kill me just can disappear the

[18:54] trust this service will be a blessing
[18:57] for you and God bless everybody that is
[19:00] on a virtual platform Sharon if you
[19:03] would you need to say my mom my link
[19:06] forgot to do that let's go to the Bible
[19:09] first Kings chapter 17 but David could
[19:17] you please help him move this or
[19:20] everybody to be able to see the board up
[19:23] there if we can go that way
[19:26] appreciate it thank you very much
[19:29] brother David has been a tremendous help
[19:32] to us amen
[19:35] [Applause]
[19:40] first Kings chapter 17 verse 8 we are
[19:44] still on our subject dealing with
[19:48] Malachi 4 we are taking our time because
[19:50] we want to lay a strong solid foundation
[19:53] one time for all and we don't have to
[19:56] come back if you have any question like
[19:58] brother branham usually refer go back
[20:01] and listen to the tape because we lay
[20:03] out material there to remove all doubt
[20:06] all questions or problem why we are
[20:10] believing the message we are believing
[20:12] today
[20:13] first Kings chapter 17 verse 8 the Bible
[20:17] says that and the word of the Lord came
[20:19] to him speaking about Elijah saying you
[20:24] might be seated
[20:28] arise get you to Zarafa which belongeth
[20:32] to Sodom and do out there
[20:34] we know those cities cities array is not
[20:37] a Jewish City
[20:38] it's a Gentile City Elijah was sent to a
[20:42] gentle woman behold I have commanded
[20:45] this woman was already ordained she was
[20:48] under the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[20:49] without even knowing that she has been
[20:52] under that anointing so God was already
[20:55] moving on this woman before she was even
[20:58] aware of it
[20:59] she was not aware that God has a hold in
[21:03] her life but God express it to his
[21:06] prophet Elijah that I have an ordained
[21:08] woman somewhere and I'm going to send
[21:11] you to that woman because according to
[21:13] Malachi 4 I will send you Elijah the
[21:17] prophet a widow woman and the point that
[21:21] the Holy Spirit wanted me to deal with
[21:24] it today is that when that woman was a
[21:27] widow you see we went through many
[21:32] description but we forgot that she was a
[21:35] widow why was this woman a widow
[21:40] why did God have to send Elijah not to a
[21:44] married woman but to a woman who is a
[21:47] widow and we don't speak about the death
[21:51] of the husband hallelujah praise God the
[21:58] anointing is so strong the Lord spoke to
[22:00] me early this morning and I know what he
[22:03] told me praise the Lord
[22:06] so he arose and went to zurafa
[22:09] and when he came to the gate of the city
[22:13] if you notice the woman was not inside
[22:16] the city but the woman was at the gate
[22:19] of the city and the gate of the city is
[22:22] usually a part of the city that is
[22:25] connected to
[22:26] demson because in the Book of Ruth when
[22:30] he was time to redeem Ruth they have to
[22:33] take her case to the gate of the city
[22:36] and it appeared that this woman was at
[22:39] the gate of the city in other words she
[22:43] was ready for redemption everybody there
[22:47] behold the widow woman was there
[22:50] gathering of sticks
[22:52] we know it's two sticks if you read down
[22:54] and he called to her and say bring me a
[22:58] prayer a little water in a vessel that I
[23:01] may drink we saw that with Eliezer and
[23:05] Rebecca asking for water we saw that
[23:08] also in John chapter 4 when Jesus was
[23:11] asking to the when he was approaching
[23:14] the woman ed well he also asked for
[23:16] water and here also Elijah approaching
[23:20] the woman spoke and asked about water
[23:23] now let's jot down on verse 17 and he
[23:29] came to pass after these things that the
[23:32] son of the woman the mistress of the
[23:35] house fell sick and his sickness was so
[23:38] small that there was no breath left in
[23:41] him and she said to Elijah what have I
[23:45] to do with you all you men of God are
[23:48] you come to me to call my sin to
[23:53] remembrance in other words the scene of
[23:56] this widow woman was already forgotten
[24:05] everybody clear
[24:06] she had seen in the past but her sin was
[24:10] already forgotten
[24:11] he was already forgiven he was already
[24:15] in a sea of God forgetfulness
[24:18] also the woman said wait a minute I'm
[24:20] not supposed to be going through what
[24:22] I'm going now because my sins are
[24:26] already forgotten are you trying to fish
[24:30] them again are you trying to bring them
[24:33] back again to remembrance
[24:35] while you saw me carrying the two sticks
[24:39] you saw me carrying the cross machine
[24:42] were already forgiven
[24:44] praise God my sins are forgiven so there
[24:47] is no way you can bring my sins again to
[24:50] remembrance and Elijah
[24:53] turn around and he went to God and
[24:56] pleaded and God restored back the child
[24:59] to life
[25:00] everybody clear so far let's go back
[25:04] let's go to Luke chapter 4
[25:07] praise God Alleluia
[25:16] remember those two things it's a widowed
[25:19] woman and her sin were already forgotten
[25:22] so there is no judgment that can stand
[25:26] against this woman in the eyes of God
[25:29] she was clear but because the Ministry
[25:33] of Elijah I have a resurrection power
[25:36] something must have happened to show
[25:38] that Elijah when he goes to the Gentile
[25:40] there will be a resurrection
[25:43] everybody clear we lay a foundation on
[25:46] Wednesday and I will strongly encourage
[25:49] you if you miss a sermon because your
[25:52] cow fell into the ditch in other word
[25:55] because you have work because you have
[25:58] to be there a word make sure before
[26:00] Sunday go on YouTube those links are
[26:04] there refresh yourself update yourself
[26:08] be on the same page so nobody is left
[26:11] behind so we don't want to be saying
[26:13] something and then we have people here
[26:15] that have not listened to 5 6 7 sermon
[26:18] down the road and you are completely
[26:20] lost when we are continuing to progress
[26:23] in other words we are building top after
[26:26] the other so make sure you stay
[26:28] connected if you at work we understand
[26:30] but on your own leisure on Thursday or
[26:34] Friday sit down
[26:36] refresh yourself put yourself on the
[26:38] same page that we move together as a
[26:40] family
[26:41] everybody clear Luke chapter 4 verse 25
[26:45] but I tell you a truth many widows were
[26:49] in Israel so Israel had many widows
[26:52] in the days of Elijah when the heaven
[26:56] will shut up three years and six month
[26:59] we spoke about this on Wednesday when
[27:01] great fun we spoke about the famine on
[27:04] Wednesday was throughout all the land in
[27:07] other word famine affected every other
[27:09] country but - none of them opposed
[27:12] Elijah sent Elijah sent Elijah was sent
[27:17] I will send you Elijah the Prophet the
[27:22] Elijah was not sent to the widow's at
[27:25] the Jewish nation in Israel but Elijah
[27:28] was sent to a widow into the Gentile
[27:31] nation everybody there and saved -
[27:34] Sarepta a city of Zion - a woman there
[27:39] was a widow in other word there were
[27:41] several widows but this woman was chosen
[27:45] one out of all those Widow to be the one
[27:49] to entertain or to receive the ministry
[27:53] of Elijah and she was a widow woman and
[27:56] he happened that Elijah went to that
[27:58] woman where make sure your Bible
[28:04] thoroughly at home brother Branham say a
[28:07] Christian should read one chapter II
[28:09] morning one chapter at night if you need
[28:11] that coat you see me so we do Bubba
[28:16] whether you understand that or not read
[28:18] your Bible listen to the message so when
[28:22] we are soaring it's going to be easy for
[28:24] you to pick it up because you already
[28:26] know the concept of Bobby - chapter 7
[28:31] verse 2 if you do can see man for the
[28:35] woman which has a husband he is bound by
[28:39] the law to her husband so long as he
[28:42] lives so as long as husband is alive
[28:46] there is no way for that woman to be
[28:48] remarried the Bible says that but if
[28:51] their husband be dead so it is important
[28:55] for the husband to be dead not your
[28:58] husband sister you need to keep your
[29:00] husband but we're going to talk about a
[29:02] different husband here
[29:04] important for the husband to die death
[29:07] also mean a separation everybody there
[29:10] praise the Lord it is important for the
[29:13] husband to die the Bible says that but
[29:15] is the husband bid
[29:18] husband so then if while her husband
[29:21] leaves she be married to another man she
[29:25] shall be called an adulterous but if her
[29:28] husband be dead she is free from that
[29:31] law so that she is no adulteress though
[29:35] she be married to another man
[29:37] wherefore my brethren you also are
[29:40] becoming dead to the law by the body of
[29:45] Christ that you should be married to
[29:49] another even to him so the marriage now
[29:53] is going to be a married unto Jesus
[29:55] Christ you're going to be married to
[29:58] Christ but your first husband must be
[30:01] dead for you to be married
[30:04] even when Eleazar was sent to Rebekah
[30:07] Eleazar was not the one to marry a
[30:10] Rebekah Eleazar was a message that was
[30:13] sent to Rebekah but we better have to be
[30:16] married to Isaac everybody clear even to
[30:20] him who is raised from the dead that we
[30:23] should bring forth fruit to God praise
[30:27] the Lord now we can pray Heavenly Father
[30:30] Lord we thank you again for your grace
[30:32] for your love your mercy for giving us
[30:34] an opportunity to be gathered together
[30:37] around the reveal world of the our Lord
[30:40] father your word stated that word
[30:43] carcasses Lord there they're eager
[30:45] opening but the carcass of the unfurling
[30:48] body word of the son of men father if

[30:59] heart that we love you Lord we don't

[31:45] work of the devil Lord away from this
[31:47] place father in the name of Jesus Christ
[31:50] amen
[31:51] god bless you we are continuing on our
[31:54] subject the unchanging pattern of God
[31:57] our theme is Malachi 4 we are on part 12
[32:02] part 12 means we start from 1 all the
[32:06] way to 12 so we're going to do a short
[32:08] summary to combine everything together
[32:11] before we built into what we are trying
[32:13] to build this morning when we started
[32:16] this series we went with the three
[32:19] bubbles that God
[32:22] we took this Ministry of Malachi 4 and
[32:25] we took that ministry all the way to the
[32:27] zodiac bubble when we finished at zodiac
[32:30] Bravo we drop down into the pyramid when
[32:34] we finish the pyramid now we are dealing
[32:36] with the written word and when we enter
[32:39] into the written word we are dealing
[32:42] specifically with the spirit of Elijah
[32:44] so we draw a character in the Bible by
[32:48] the name of Elijah and throughout this
[32:51] series we took time to give you
[32:54] description of the Ministry of Elijah
[32:56] Elijah this allegedly did that Elijah
[33:00] went to more Orab he had an experience
[33:02] and there was a whirlwind that came down
[33:05] struck the mountain and the rock split
[33:07] over and you all know about it now we
[33:10] spoke about Elijah restoring the heart
[33:13] of the children back into God so we
[33:15] expressed that ministry in detail to
[33:18] help you identify what God has been
[33:21] doing in this age because God is
[33:24] identified by his characteristic so when
[33:28] we dealt with this with Pan Am expansion
[33:32] that Elijah is a prophet not only
[33:35] confined to the Jewish nation but Elijah
[33:39] is a prophet that deals both with the
[33:42] Jews and also with the Gentile in other
[33:45] where the spirit of Elijah will have Tom
[33:47] that is going to be dealing with the
[33:49] Jewish nation but that spirit also will
[33:51] have a time when it's going to be
[33:53] dealing with the Gentile nation and we
[33:56] find out that that spirit appear five
[33:59] times in the Bible the first time the
[34:02] spirit appear was in the man Elijah and
[34:05] the second time we found our spirit
[34:07] coming down in the man by the name of
[34:09] Russia and the third time we found that
[34:12] same spirit coming down in John the
[34:16] Baptist and in the fifth time we found
[34:18] Elijah according to revelation 11 going
[34:21] back to the Jewish with Moses and Elijah
[34:24] himself so we found out that all the
[34:27] four appearing of Elijah that I have
[34:31] just described all of them were
[34:33] connected to the Jewish nation Elijah
[34:36] himself was a Jew Elijah was a Jew John
[34:41] the Baptist was a Jew and then when you
[34:44] go to the book of Revelation Elijah and
[34:46] Moses both of them will be again Jewish
[34:49] nation Jewish people but we found out
[34:52] that at the forthcoming of Elijah that
[34:54] coming of Elijah was connected not with
[34:57] the Jews but Elijah was connected to the
[35:00] Gentile but before we just speak about
[35:03] it like that there must be a connection
[35:07] somewhere in the scripture because when
[35:09] God started a ministry somewhere God
[35:12] will always have a reference in the
[35:15] Bible to support them ministry that's
[35:19] the reason why when the people went to
[35:21] John the Baptist they asked John the
[35:23] Baptist they say who are you John the
[35:25] Baptist gave them the scripture he said
[35:28] I am the voice of the one crying into
[35:31] the wilderness in other word there was a
[35:33] foundation there was a based there was
[35:36] some scripture in the Bible to always
[35:39] support a ministry even when Jesus
[35:42] Christ if you look at the life of Jesus
[35:44] Christ you will find out that when
[35:46] Christ was going from place to place the
[35:48] Bible always refer that he was sweet'n
[35:51] he was spoken by the Prophet Jeremiah he
[35:55] was spoken by the prophet Isaiah
[35:57] he was spoken by the prophet Daniel so
[36:00] somewhere somehow in the Bible there
[36:02] must be a connection there must be a
[36:05] reference and when brother Branham came
[36:07] here in this end time with his ministry
[36:10] brother Branham began to refer to
[36:12] Malachi for brother Branham begins to
[36:14] refer to Genesis 18 brother Branham
[36:17] begins to refer to revelation 8:10 all
[36:20] those scripture are bases that have been
[36:23] laid in Scripture as a reference to make
[36:27] sure the children of God understand that
[36:29] thou which was professor here in the
[36:32] Bible this is the fulfillment of it so
[36:36] to get the basis of Elijah the spirit of
[36:40] Elijah dealing with the Gentile we found
[36:43] out that Elijah was given experience
[36:45] with the crow and we found out that the
[36:48] Jewish people were people that were very
[36:50] strict about the religion it didn't have
[36:53] any dealing with the people from Assad
[36:56] and we took also Peter in the book of
[36:59] art and we found out that God have to
[37:02] give Peter and experience before sending
[37:05] him to the house of Cornelius
[37:07] because Peter spoke to the people of the
[37:09] house of Cornelius he says that the you
[37:11] know for sure that there is no dealing
[37:14] between the Jewish and the Gentile so in
[37:17] order for God to prepare his messenger
[37:20] in order for God to prepare his man God
[37:23] have to use an experienced God have to
[37:27] give them an experience with something
[37:32] low looks unclean but God was just
[37:34] telling them not I'm going to go to that
[37:36] nation that looks like it's an unclean
[37:39] nation so after dealing with the crew or
[37:42] the Riven we found out that Elijah now
[37:45] moving to a different stop of his
[37:48] ministry where the widow woman came into
[37:51] view but we know this widow woman was a
[37:54] gentle woman and according to the
[37:56] teaching of the message a woman in the
[37:58] Bible speak of a church and we know
[38:01] according to the book of fact that when
[38:03] the Jewish people reject that Jesus
[38:06] Christ God move into the Gentile because
[38:09] we have to take
[38:11] magenta for his namesake
[38:14] and that people from the jente was
[38:17] called the bride of the Lord Jesus
[38:19] Christ but the problem is when you look
[38:22] at the dispensation of the jente you
[38:25] will find out that the Gentile
[38:26] dispensation was divided into seven
[38:29] churches and those seven churches have
[38:34] seven messenger and those messenger of
[38:37] the seven churches are the pastor of the
[38:41] churches in other words we have seven
[38:44] man's in the churches we have seven
[38:47] pastors in the churches but the spirit
[38:50] of Elijah is going to move to the
[38:52] Gentile now which pastor is going to be
[38:55] the one to be anointed with the spirit
[38:58] of Elijah is that going to be Paul is
[39:00] that going to be Iranians is that gonna
[39:02] be Columba is that going to be Martin
[39:05] he's not going to be looter is that
[39:07] going to be wesley or is that going to
[39:09] be brother branham so we need to find
[39:12] out who is this man because every church
[39:15] always or must have a pastor and as it
[39:19] changes the messenger to the church ages
[39:22] were also pastor to those Church ages
[39:26] brother Branham said this in the
[39:28] revelation of Jesus Christ
[39:30] he said the letter to the seven churches
[39:33] were written prophetically to the future
[39:36] age Paul both of the life and glory of
[39:40] the self ages present in his day John
[39:45] wrote of the life and glory of the seven
[39:49] churches in the future that John was
[39:52] addressing the seven pastors so the
[39:56] messenger is a pastor to the age
[39:59] everybody there pastors or messenger as
[40:04] directly or questioned under these seven
[40:07] different angels and brother Branham in
[40:09] the revelation book of symbols he says
[40:11] that your pastor when he stands here on
[40:15] the platform ministering the Word of God
[40:18] he is God's angel to the church
[40:22] so the messenger when they were giving
[40:25] their message to the church ages the
[40:27] messenger were God's angel the specific
[40:31] churches but there is a messenger to the
[40:36] church therefore a pastor should never
[40:39] leave the world but stay straight with
[40:42] the because he's feeding the Shepherd
[40:46] places that's why I always refer you
[40:49] those who say brother Stephen say always
[40:52] say the Bible say and brother Branham
[40:55] say because I must say strict to the
[40:58] Word of God because the word is what's
[41:00] gonna prepare you to meet your husband
[41:03] because the word pastor means a shepherd
[41:07] lucida
[41:10] and on a pastor is a shepherd and the
[41:13] Holy Ghost hath made him overseer over a
[41:16] certain flock to feed them we art with
[41:19] the Word of God a manner so the
[41:22] passenger here were pastor to every
[41:25] single church age and we must say under
[41:29] our pastor if we are living in the
[41:32] Ephesian Church you must make sure your
[41:35] message or your preaching stays under
[41:39] power that's why Paul say if someone
[41:41] come down if another angel come down if
[41:45] another messenger come down if another
[41:48] pastor comes down if we preach a message
[41:51] different and what we preach to you that
[41:54] man is the cursed and under the seventh
[41:57] messenger we need to make sure all the
[42:00] minister here
[42:01] stay with the Word of God we must stay
[42:04] under the pastor of the LG because he's
[42:08] the one that receives the revelation
[42:10] from God everybody clear so now we have
[42:13] seven churches we have seven pastor but
[42:17] which pastor is going to be the one to
[42:20] receive that anointing of Elijah so when
[42:24] we went back to our scripture in the
[42:26] book of 1st Kings chapter 17 we found
[42:31] out that they were characteristic about
[42:33] this woman that also helped us to
[42:36] identify who that specific messenger who
[42:41] does specific pastor is going to be so
[42:45] we found out that thank God to the
[42:48] opening of the seventh year because it
[42:50] took the seal to direct to us where or
[42:54] which age the specific anointing of
[42:57] Elijah will be coming down and we know
[43:00] that even though there is seven church
[43:02] ages the dispensation of the jente have
[43:05] been divided into four seals we know the
[43:09] first seal the second seal the third
[43:11] seal and the folks here if you were
[43:14] under my teaching a long time you should
[43:17] be familiar we
[43:18] the seals we know that at the first seal
[43:21] when he happened the spirit of the
[43:23] Antichrist enter into the churches and
[43:26] begin to destroy the work of God or
[43:28] destroy the churches of God then had
[43:32] brought the horse rider that was their
[43:34] switch holes from a white horse into a
[43:37] red horse and in the hurdles we found
[43:40] out that dowel rod was given a sword and
[43:43] he begin to kill people and he kills 68
[43:46] million people throughout the ages then
[43:49] the riders changed and went to the black
[43:53] horse rider and over there he was having
[43:55] some element which we dealt with on
[43:58] Wednesday and then on the last arriving
[44:01] of this horse rider we found out that
[44:04] his name was revealed because that
[44:06] anointing I have to fight him was the
[44:09] ego anointing and the ego was able to
[44:12] look at a horse rider and decode his
[44:16] name and told us that his name was death
[44:20] so when we look in the life of this
[44:23] widow woman we found out that Elijah
[44:25] described truth to things Elijah says
[44:29] that Israel number one have forsaken
[44:32] your commandment if you recall on wisdom
[44:36] number two Elijah said they have
[44:38] forsaken your commandment and they have
[44:40] destroy your altars and then Elijah
[44:44] continued to explain his complaint to
[44:47] God he said number two Israel killed
[44:50] your prophet with the soul so there was
[44:53] a killing by the sword and we found
[44:56] later on that God put a curse upon the
[44:59] rain and when God put a curse upon the
[45:02] rain as we described that on Wednesday
[45:05] will find that the rain in the scripture
[45:07] effect usually 3-phase is going to
[45:11] affect the call when it affects the corn
[45:14] it affect the wheat corn and he also
[45:17] affect the barley corn and the rain also
[45:20] not only it's affected the corner the
[45:23] rain affected the liner and the rain
[45:25] also affected the oiler if you miss one
[45:29] there you need to review that because
[45:30] it's very important for you to catch
[45:32] what I'm saying and we found out that
[45:35] when the seal broke on the first church
[45:38] ages when the world when the white horse
[45:41] rod was riding in well when the message
[45:44] to the first church age is coming god
[45:46] had a complain to the edge of Ephesus
[45:49] not say that there is something in
[45:52] Ephesus that I don't like and what
[45:54] happened was that big church have left
[45:57] their first love the church had forsaken
[46:01] their first love and the Antichrist
[46:03] spirit was getting in destroying the
[46:06] altars because we found out that the
[46:09] altar in the sculpture means the place
[46:12] of worship or a church so we found out
[46:16] that when Elijah was telling God that
[46:19] Israel forsaken your covenant Elijah was
[46:23] already giving us a clue that the first
[46:26] seal was already running into the land
[46:29] and then we found out that when the
[46:31] second seal open up the Antichrist begin
[46:34] to kill the children of God and Elijah
[46:37] spoke to God he says that the children
[46:39] or the prophets of God were killed by
[46:42] the soul in other word second seal also
[46:45] was running its course and then the
[46:48] third time we found out that when the
[46:51] rain was affected those three element
[46:54] were affected the valley was affected
[46:56] the village was affected the one who's
[47:00] affected and the oil also was affected
[47:03] so when he was affected that spoke of
[47:06] the third seal because the third seal
[47:08] when he was open up we found out that
[47:11] the O's Iran the host man that came out
[47:13] one penny and a measure of Valor for one
[47:17] penny but a voice spoke to him and said
[47:20] do not touch the wine and the oil if
[47:23] that voice didn't come up there the
[47:26] Antichrist will have messed up
[47:27] everything else so in other world when
[47:30] the rain was stricken
[47:32] he was the time that the third seal was
[47:35] already
[47:36] running into the land but when Elijah
[47:39] went to the woman and Elijah asked that
[47:42] woman and say I need for you to give me
[47:44] water and also to give me bread the
[47:47] woman told Elijah that I only have a
[47:50] handful of mill and a handful of oil and
[47:54] I'm trying to ma'am Allah here and as
[47:57] soon as I finish cooking my meal me and
[48:00] my son will do water will die so we can
[48:04] see that death was speaking of the
[48:06] phosphorus harder right there in other
[48:09] word the time that Elijah went and meet
[48:12] that woman was the time that the parish
[48:16] rather will be riding into the land
[48:19] everybody clear so far or did I lose
[48:22] someone let's read a little bit brother
[48:25] Branham brother Branham said this in be
[48:28] certain of God he says she was with a
[48:31] woman and we don't know what she what
[48:34] she with a woman would have went through
[48:37] with her husband dead and a young boy to
[48:41] race and in the Lance there they
[48:44] depended on their crops they didn't have
[48:47] project as we have today the on defense
[48:51] plant they depended on their crops and
[48:54] because the iniquity of the people and
[48:56] the moral decaying had brought a draught
[49:00] on the land here they was all starving
[49:04] and dying in other world the third seal
[49:07] was already hitting because the third
[49:09] seal alls famine and then we found that
[49:13] no doubt she had pray night after night
[49:16] all night as she begin to see the mihrab
[49:20] arrow going down down down and he must
[49:24] get to a place till there was not even
[49:26] another cup full of meal in the barrel
[49:29] our she had was just a little and full
[49:33] death the parallels rather death was
[49:38] coming right into the gate at her door
[49:43] so we understand here that when Elijah
[49:47] reached the
[49:48] want to meet that woman that gentle
[49:51] woman was at the time when death was
[49:54] already into the land so Elijah going to
[49:58] the Gentile Elijah will not come under
[50:01] the vessel Elijah would not come under
[50:04] the first seal is telling you that Paul
[50:07] does not qualify to have the spirit of
[50:09] Elijah erroneous does not qualify to
[50:12] have the spirit of Elijah Columba Mazda
[50:16] Martin does not qualify to have the
[50:18] spirit of Elijah because of those three
[50:21] are already eliminated and we found that
[50:24] when Elijah spoke about Jezebel killing
[50:28] nature deputy servant of God by the soul
[50:32] if you study your title in church age
[50:35] you found out that God mentioned the
[50:37] woman Jezebel in the Tartarian church
[50:40] ages but we found out that those time
[50:44] Elijah went to the gentlewoman in other
[50:47] word Martin or Coloma you've claimed the
[50:51] third seal also hits the land Elijah did
[50:54] not go in Batam in other world looter
[50:58] and Wesley are completely disqualified
[51:01] to receive the spirit of Elijah and we
[51:03] found out that the edge that received
[51:06] the per horse rider is the Lao decent
[51:10] Church age in other word the only
[51:13] messenger that's going to be qualified
[51:16] to receive the spirit of Elijah he is
[51:20] going to be the messenger to the seventh
[51:23] church age which is called the age of
[51:25] loud isha and we found out on Wednesday
[51:29] according to Emma's the Bible said that
[51:31] there will be famine in the land and
[51:34] brother Branham said that scripture when
[51:36] Emma was speaking about the scripture he
[51:39] is so America he's so spirit of Elijah
[51:42] the anointing of Elijah will be coming
[51:45] in the last church age when the pair
[51:48] horse is running and it's going to be in
[51:50] the land of America which automatically
[51:54] brother brother to be the one to receive
[51:57] the spirit of a larger
[52:00] everybody clear
[52:01] so far praise the Lord and we found out
[52:03] that when Elijah went to this widow
[52:06] woman this Widow men have food
[52:09] the a food that have been provided by
[52:13] the divine blessings of God because the
[52:17] food that she had she had food of she
[52:21] had mill in her house and she also have
[52:24] all in a house and we found out on
[52:27] Wednesday that the Land of Israel was a
[52:29] land that was blessed by God through the
[52:32] rain and the rain in the Land of Israel
[52:35] was the one that was responsible for
[52:38] bringing the meal and also bringing also
[52:41] the old she had food that she was eating
[52:44] but that food was not enough to keep her
[52:48] from death because she told Elijah that
[52:52] I'm going to mix this food and as soon
[52:54] as I've finished eating this food the
[52:56] food I'm gonna die so she had the Bible
[53:00] with her already she had the Word of God
[53:03] already but for told us that the letter
[53:07] killeth in other words the Bible we got
[53:11] the revelation killers that's why Elijah
[53:14] have to come down and Imagi
[53:17] gave her a second food and the second
[53:20] food of Elijah was not different to the
[53:24] first food he was not contradictory to
[53:27] the first food but he was a spoken word
[53:30] food and with the spoken word food when
[53:34] the woman begin to eat the food because
[53:38] before the logic aims that woman lost
[53:41] weight the woman had cheek bones
[53:43] sticking out that woman did not even
[53:46] have strength but the food that came
[53:49] from the spoken word of Elijah begin to
[53:52] bring the vitamin into the body and
[53:55] to bring a body change to that woman are
[53:58] you there so you don't need to have only
[54:01] natural food you need the Bible with the
[54:04] spoken word and the spoken word will
[54:07] never contradict the scripture because
[54:10] it's the same food but just one is love
[54:13] and one was just the originator
[54:15] everybody so far good and if you notice
[54:19] when Elijah spoke the food he was a
[54:22] creative anointing that happened only to
[54:26] the gentle woman and we know the
[54:29] creating anointing is the turn to
[54:32] anointing and if you notice Elijah
[54:36] created the food before he went to
[54:39] already that's the reason why the
[54:43] creation of squirrel happened in 1959
[54:47] before the opening of the seals
[54:51] everybody clear
[54:52] so everything is line up by the
[54:56] scripture are we clear
[54:58] so we need Elijah's food but the problem
[55:02] we're going to be dealing with today is
[55:04] this woman is a widow so why is this
[55:09] woman a widow we understand that when we
[55:14] spoke about we don't we don't
[55:16] automatically speak about a death of a
[55:20] face husband in other word this woman
[55:22] was married this woman had a husband and
[55:26] something happened to the husband and
[55:29] this woman ending up losing her husband
[55:32] so before Elijah meets the woman that
[55:36] woman have to lose her first husband
[55:40] because the Ministry of Elijah is a
[55:43] ministry that takes a nation that takes
[55:47] Israel and unite Israel back again to
[55:50] God in other world when Elijah pop up
[55:54] onto the scene there are women or Israel
[55:57] was already under
[55:59] spirit of Jezebel but Elijah have to
[56:02] come down and make sure the spirit is
[56:05] completely destroyed and that the woman
[56:08] and unite that woman but again together
[56:10] because as long as the woman is still
[56:14] connected with the system of Jezebel
[56:17] there is no way that you can be married
[56:20] to another husband if you do that it's
[56:23] going to be against the law
[56:25] that's the reason why if you notice in
[56:27] the scripture there was a woman by the
[56:29] name of Abigail Abigail was married by
[56:32] the name by a man by the name of
[56:34] neighbor and brother Brian and the
[56:37] barber also explained to us that
[56:38] neighbor means Foley the Bible say that
[56:42] he was a rude man he was a bad man but
[56:46] before David get married to this woman
[56:49] this woman husband must die God killed
[56:54] Abel God killed the first husband then a
[56:57] bigger death was given a right to marry
[57:00] David but when David went and tried to
[57:03] take you riders wiser God struck that
[57:06] completely because Uriah was still alive
[57:09] their husband must be dead before the
[57:13] woman be united to another one everybody
[57:17] clear so far
[57:17] now let's dig into this a little more
[57:21] and before I go there I'm going to
[57:23] remind you this that brother Branham say
[57:26] that this little woman must have been of
[57:29] the caliber of Elisha and insisting
[57:32] there in other words Elisha and this
[57:36] woman have the same nature because
[57:40] usually action shows what you are and
[57:42] again she had been chosen it's grace to
[57:46] entertain God's prophet remember she was
[57:48] a gentle nor a Jew and the land was
[57:52] burning up the third seal was hearing
[57:54] and no doubt that this little woman
[57:56] being of that caliber being of the
[57:59] believer how can brother Branham call
[58:02] this woman a believer
[58:04] where is he written in the Bible that
[58:06] this woman was a believer but we found
[58:09] this woman claiming that her
[58:11] in was already did brother branham ever
[58:15] give you the scripture no they denied
[58:19] know everybody there for we see that God
[58:24] would not have caught her if she had not
[58:27] been worthy want to entertain God's
[58:30] prophet when God sends you Elijah the
[58:34] prophet automatically know that you are
[58:37] worthy in the eyes of God in the book of
[58:43] Revelation chapter father there was a
[58:45] book in the hand of God and the king and
[58:50] the angel asked he said who is worthy to
[58:53] take the book to break the seal and to
[58:56] lose it no one the Bible said no one in
[58:59] heaven no one on the earth and no one
[59:03] even in Hell under the heaven and then
[59:06] the king's men we dealer came and he
[59:08] took the book and he brought the seals
[59:11] but if you go in the book of Revelation
[59:15] chapter 10 when the mighty angel came
[59:18] down a voice to John and say John go to
[59:24] the angel and take Bobby are you there
[59:28] and John knew that no one was worthy to
[59:32] take the book so when John approached
[59:34] the angel John was a little bit scared
[59:38] John had a little complex I am not
[59:41] worthy I am not worthy I am not worthy
[59:44] and John went to the elder and he said
[59:47] angel can you please give me the book do
[59:50] you know what the angel say the angel
[59:52] said you take it in other words you are
[59:55] worthy to touch the book just like the
[59:58] man touch the book you also are worthy
[1:00:01] to touch them in other words lose your
[1:00:04] complex use your trouble
[1:00:07] remove all your conflicts you have the
[1:00:09] right to touch the book observe
[1:00:12] Jesus Christ you are not anybody you are
[1:00:21] an electrician you have been found
[1:00:23] worthy to go to the hand of the angel
[1:00:26] first touching that book was death but
[1:00:30] after the king said Lila the angel could
[1:00:33] have taken the book and say taken the
[1:00:36] angel said if I give it to him he's not
[1:00:38] going to learn I want him to exercise
[1:00:41] his right you come yourself put your
[1:00:44] hand in my hand and take the book from
[1:00:46] my hand
[1:00:47] are you clear when a large I sent to you
[1:00:51] God have declared you worry everybody
[1:00:59] clear everybody clear so far now when we
[1:01:04] are dealing with this let's dig down in
[1:01:08] the book of action as we're looking at
[1:01:10] this widow woman praise the name of the
[1:01:14] Lord if you dare you can say a manner up
[1:01:19] to chapter 7 we can't rush you with this
[1:01:24] stuff if we get this done then on
[1:01:32] Wednesday Lord willing we're gonna take
[1:01:33] that safe first and the second poll
[1:01:35] because we already touched the third
[1:01:36] cool we need to see that in the
[1:01:38] scripture in the Ministry of Elijah
[1:01:44] everybody there add to chapter 7 verse 6
[1:01:49] the Bible says that and God spoke on
[1:01:52] this why's that his seed should surgeon
[1:01:55] in a strange land and that there should
[1:01:58] bring them into bondage and entreat them
[1:02:02] evil 400 years talking about the
[1:02:04] children of Israel and the nation to him
[1:02:08] - our beam bonded wooja will our judge
[1:02:11] say God and after that shall they come
[1:02:15] forth and serve me in this place Israel
[1:02:19] went into Egypt and when they went into
[1:02:23] Egypt there was a
[1:02:25] that was there in Egypt and Pharaoh was
[1:02:30] dealing with a man called Joseph are you
[1:02:33] there and under the ministry of Joseph
[1:02:37] Joseph was able to take the entire
[1:02:40] nation of Egypt and hook them under fill
[1:02:45] in sold their land look at your
[1:02:48] scriptures they even sold themselves and
[1:02:52] to Pharaoh so not only was Egypt put
[1:02:55] under the bondage or the connection or
[1:02:59] the relationship with Pharaoh but the
[1:03:02] nation of Israel also moving to Egypt
[1:03:06] and they landed in the land of Goshen
[1:03:09] and go Joseph took the Jewish people and
[1:03:12] put them in marriage will Pharaoh
[1:03:18] everybody there and when we put them in
[1:03:22] marriage with Pharaoh everything was
[1:03:25] good
[1:03:25] are you following me no problem praise
[1:03:29] God
[1:03:30] now let's drop down to verse 17 but when
[1:03:36] the time of the promised journey
[1:03:40] everybody clear this fellow was good all
[1:03:45] this time there was a good pastor
[1:03:52] augustana until the time that the
[1:03:58] promise of exodus comes then something
[1:04:04] happened to Philip Alleluia let's go to
[1:04:12] verse 17 but when the time of the
[1:04:17] promised journey which God has shown to
[1:04:21] Abraham the people grew and multiplied
[1:04:25] in Egypt a big church are you there
[1:04:29] until another king arose which knew not
[1:04:36] Joseph
[1:04:38] now the tarot Pharaoh is not a men
[1:04:44] fellow is like a president fellow is
[1:04:49] like Caesar
[1:04:51] we are President Obama President Trump
[1:04:55] but president is not their name it is a
[1:04:59] tarot reader fellow is like a pastor
[1:05:03] either but Joseph had a great ministry
[1:05:09] in Egypt and the Ministry of Joseph was
[1:05:13] known all around the world it is and
[1:05:18] every fellow that came always
[1:05:22] acknowledged the ministry of Joseph and
[1:05:25] traded is their food because of Joseph
[1:05:30] everybody there but something happened
[1:05:33] when the time of deliverance joke near
[1:05:38] another Pharaoh rose another spirit
[1:05:44] enter into the pastorship and the spirit
[1:05:49] begin to reject the message of Joseph
[1:05:57] the first Pharaoh must die hallelujah
[1:06:08] they all the fellow who raised up who
[1:06:13] did not know chosen
[1:06:15] how can a fellow be in Egypt not knowing
[1:06:19] Joseph in other word that Pharaoh
[1:06:23] willing fully rejected the message of
[1:06:28] Joseph the fellow that was guru the
[1:06:33] fellow that was a good manner suddenly
[1:06:36] something happen in the life of the
[1:06:39] Pharaoh where a new fellow writer and
[1:06:43] to destroy the message of Joseph the
[1:06:47] message that they claim the message that
[1:06:51] they uphold the message that they
[1:06:53] cherish but something happened and
[1:06:55] suddenly a pharaoh begin to attack the
[1:06:59] very thing that they were honoring why
[1:07:03] the time of deliverance is near
[1:07:07] everybody clear there was the beginning
[1:07:12] of the beginning that was the beginning
[1:07:15] of Exodus and when that thing begin to
[1:07:19] form under political power beginning
[1:07:23] begin to form God begin to get so this
[1:07:28] church you must be ready because God
[1:07:31] also is ready the iniquity of the
[1:07:35] Amorite was fulfilled the time that he
[1:07:39] promised Abraham was fulfilled and the
[1:07:41] time of deliverance was at hand so when
[1:07:45] you see a good pharaoh a good pastor
[1:07:49] suddenly changing and began to reject
[1:07:53] the message it is the signal that's that
[1:07:57] of going in handle God permitted a
[1:08:06] fellow to raise up who do not Joseph and
[1:08:11] Remus's was born and right after City
[1:08:15] come Remus's so in other word the one
[1:08:19] anointing now is la Sadie Sadie
[1:08:22] recognized the message Sadie honored the
[1:08:26] message
[1:08:26] Sadie loved the message man now you are
[1:08:29] dealing with Francis everybody and
[1:08:33] ramasees was the one who knew not the
[1:08:37] blessings of Joseph he didn't know what
[1:08:41] the spiritual side walls that's why you
[1:08:48] look at somebody you say I'm not dealing
[1:08:51] with the same man this man used
[1:08:53] this man used to be fun but he looks
[1:08:57] like when I'm talking to him he's not
[1:08:59] the first man that I knew it is a
[1:09:02] different unknown think I have moving
[1:09:04] and that nothing reject the message of
[1:09:08] the land he was only a political genius
[1:09:16] that he could take it
[1:09:18] Gopa he is worrying about a worldwide
[1:09:21] ministry and all the rest of the country
[1:09:24] and military might now it's the power of
[1:09:28] men remember Moses did that and he was
[1:09:32] killing people okay
[1:09:35] everybody and that's all he knew was the
[1:09:39] military might and Moses in this message
[1:09:42] he was born this prophet but he was
[1:09:45] raised in an intellectual school and
[1:09:47] Pharaoh's Palace they fell setting the
[1:09:50] good one died he was raised under was a
[1:09:53] man that still had honor and believed
[1:09:57] Joseph being the prophet of them so your
[1:10:00] first Pharaoh believed the message your
[1:10:04] first Pharaoh loved the message your
[1:10:08] first Pharaoh are not the message but
[1:10:11] now rhombuses moving but there are
[1:10:17] compromises after city and Rama says did
[1:10:21] not care about Joseph and therefore
[1:10:25] there is one day trouble started when
[1:10:28] they raised up a pharaoh who did not
[1:10:31] know Joseph but why is he that we had
[1:10:35] said II save you all the good men say
[1:10:39] the owner Joseph study believed message
[1:10:42] Sarah treated as good because of Joseph
[1:10:44] why did God permits Eddie to die why did
[1:10:50] God permit the first husband to die why
[1:10:54] did God permit this first husband to be
[1:10:58] separated from the message why what is
[1:11:03] the purpose
[1:11:06] brother branham men are not infallible
[1:11:12] but God is man you get your mind on a
[1:11:18] man he shall make a mistake
[1:11:22] maybe not willfully but he is a dude God
[1:11:27] permits him to do it so that he can
[1:11:33] shake yourself away from men I mean
[1:11:40] Israel got comfortable with city it
[1:11:44] Israel got caught up ready and God
[1:11:48] permit a pharaoh to Rosa in order to
[1:11:52] break Israel completely from Pharaoh
[1:11:56] because Moses is coming God permit him
[1:12:05] to do it so that he can shake your faith
[1:12:07] away from men our faith is not in the
[1:12:11] wisdom of men but in the power of the
[1:12:15] resurrection of Jesus trust that is
[1:12:18] where the true seed of Abraham helps
[1:12:20] their promise because they can only be
[1:12:23] the seed of Abram and they receive the
[1:12:26] Holy Spirit
[1:12:27] without the Holy Spirit they are not the
[1:12:30] seed of Abram the same faith that was in
[1:12:34] Abraham comes into the believer no
[1:12:37] matter what takes place and how can we
[1:12:40] delete the believer marches right on so
[1:12:44] the first Pharaoh the first husband must
[1:12:48] die
[1:12:49] are you there Israel must be a widow
[1:12:54] before Moses comes in in Israel must be
[1:13:01] separated from the fleshly laws of the
[1:13:05] first husband until the second husband
[1:13:10] comes in are we clear
[1:13:12] let's go to the book of Exodus chapter
[1:13:15] 19 why a widow
[1:13:20] why a widow everybody there Exodus
[1:13:30] chapter 19 verse 3 if you dare you can
[1:13:39] end alone at the mountain saying to the
[1:13:43] Egyptian I'm sorry and how I bore you on
[1:13:47] eagle's wings who saw Eagle in Egypt
[1:13:53] carrying Israel blood what I'm saying
[1:13:59] the Bible speaks of her prophet in the
[1:14:04] world as sexual prophet Moses and the
[1:14:07] Ministry of Moses were carrying Israel
[1:14:14] everybody and brought you to myself so
[1:14:23] the purpose of sending Moses ministry
[1:14:27] was to pull Israel from Egypt and bring
[1:14:32] Israel unto God in other words said it
[1:14:36] must die Israel must be a widow to
[1:14:41] Pharaoh in order for me to come and to
[1:14:45] join Israel to go
[1:14:52] Oh if you
[1:14:56] and it mark above all people for all the
[1:15:02] on the world in the world I'm sorry us
[1:15:09] Israel there were many widows in Israel
[1:15:13] but God only chose the one that was in
[1:15:16] service with a city must die everybody
[1:15:24] clear six and you shall be to me a
[1:15:30] kingdom of what so the purpose of
[1:15:34] bringing Israel of Israel to be not only
[1:15:47] the pictures but the entire nation
[1:15:52] please that's why the well ship when he
[1:15:56] comes out it is a son that the entire
[1:15:59] field the same level a weekly he say a
[1:16:07] kingdom of priests a holy nation
[1:16:12] these are the world which is you shall
[1:16:14] speak to the children of what Israel
[1:16:17] selling you ours Roger the prophet bring
[1:16:22] you to myself so that you all of you
[1:16:26] women and men become rich stop daddy
[1:16:33] why a widow brother branham Sade's I was
[1:16:41] seeing on the video when I was just a
[1:16:44] timing my first group in the Baptist
[1:16:46] Church have hanji ternoon and a devil in
[1:16:52] closing now it is not because of you is
[1:16:57] referring to the pillar of fire
[1:16:59] everybody there that because one a
[1:17:07] worth-ship just you
[1:17:10] one of the prophets you see that pleura
[1:17:13] among the children of Israel brother
[1:17:22] Branham is the prophet but brother
[1:17:25] Branham is not the bride a leader he was
[1:17:31] just one of them
[1:17:33] everybody clear see the pillar of fire
[1:17:37] never just follow Moses you have access
[1:17:45] to the Sun God
[1:17:47] that work with brother Branham if he
[1:17:51] lives in brother Branham he must also
[1:17:53] heal in your life honor the life that's
[1:17:56] why Jesus said the works that I do you
[1:18:00] shall doing also you have access to the
[1:18:04] self power everybody there the pillar of
[1:18:10] fire never just follow Moses although he
[1:18:15] said I shall send my angel before - if d
[1:18:19] in the way but he was not just for Moses
[1:18:23] only he was for all Israel your transfer
[1:18:29] must die then God sent you a prophet to
[1:18:34] unite him to him so that you also as a
[1:18:38] high priest have a right to the pillar
[1:18:42] of fire let's see brother branham's talk
[1:18:49] but what I'm say that speaking about the
[1:18:52] widow he said that her man had died
[1:18:55] we're talking about a widow now you know
[1:18:59] she was a widow
[1:19:01] when Elijah came back from his
[1:19:03] wilderness journey he was a widow
[1:19:06] Elijah was sent to her she was glad to
[1:19:09] hear the Prophet dead after her man had
[1:19:13] died after Sadie died a new Pharaoh
[1:19:19] arose and begin to do things
[1:19:22] not pleasing unto you anymore when the
[1:19:26] sand Moses the massive losses will be
[1:19:29] sweet to your ears in touch bitterness
[1:19:37] for you to appreciate sweetness
[1:19:41] that's why rates in the message come you
[1:19:44] want to cherish those message you wanna
[1:19:47] love the message Lord an organization so
[1:19:58] that woman was under men that men
[1:20:00] rock-bottom said he was organization her
[1:20:04] organization was put into the
[1:20:06] Confederation of churches in other word
[1:20:11] fellow city that love Joseph died
[1:20:16] reverses rejected Joseph and enter into
[1:20:21] the Confederation of churches he went
[1:20:25] back to the Baptist he want to do this
[1:20:29] he went back to the denominational fence
[1:20:38] just like so he killed the witches and
[1:20:42] he ended up going to the witch her
[1:20:48] organization was put in a confederation
[1:20:51] of churches she sin well she was it that
[1:20:56] woman realized hey I have been
[1:20:59] mistreated I have been taken advantage
[1:21:02] of I have been mistreated I put my trust
[1:21:06] in fellow now look at this fellow it is
[1:21:09] not your first fellow you are dealing
[1:21:12] with romances are you here and what the
[1:21:16] prophet has said come to pass
[1:21:19] she was willing God still loved her and
[1:21:22] the Prophet went down there and kept her
[1:21:25] alive why the Death Angel is circulating
[1:21:30] until he crossed Jordan the rupture and
[1:21:33] the famine was
[1:21:35] / what a beautiful picture of the coming
[1:21:39] of the Lord they're in Elijah you see
[1:21:44] now perfect and remember this message in
[1:21:49] the last day is to be given by Elijah
[1:21:53] and with omen the Prophet he spilt upon
[1:21:58] the church everybody clear so far so
[1:22:02] what about brother Branham himself not
[1:22:06] for one moment
[1:22:08] remember when Israel was brought from
[1:22:10] Egypt he was to be united with who God
[1:22:14] when the spirit of Elijah comes is to
[1:22:18] bring your heart but to God brother
[1:22:21] Branham said not for the moment do I
[1:22:24] bring a message to the people that they
[1:22:27] may follow me or join my church or start
[1:22:31] some fellowship and organization I have
[1:22:34] never done that and will not do it that
[1:22:38] would not do that now I have no interest
[1:22:42] in those things at ramesses but I do
[1:22:47] have an interest in the things of God
[1:22:49] and people and if I can accomplish just
[1:22:53] one thing I will be satisfied that one
[1:22:57] thing is to see establish a true
[1:23:01] spiritual relationship between God and
[1:23:05] learn essential Moses to bring you unto
[1:23:10] myself either where we men become new
[1:23:16] creation across film within spirit and
[1:23:20] live according to his word I will invite
[1:23:23] plead and warn all to hear his voice at
[1:23:26] this time and yield your lives
[1:23:29] completely to him even as I trust in my
[1:23:31] heart that I have given my all to him
[1:23:34] god bless you and may he is coming
[1:23:36] rejoiced no heart so brother Branham
[1:23:40] also purpose in
[1:23:41] to restore you back to your husband but
[1:23:45] your first husband said he must die
[1:23:48] everybody clear if the pillar of fire
[1:23:53] was not for Moses only and we see the
[1:23:56] returning of the pillar of fire nowadays
[1:23:58] what about in our day a lot clearer
[1:24:01] brother Branham the angel of the
[1:24:04] covenant now that was the pillar of fire

[1:35:25] why a priesthood a priesthood why a
[1:35:31] widow there is a mystery to the widow
[1:35:34] everybody there and now let's enter
[1:35:37] Cornelius got to chapter 10 we just
[1:35:45] dropping one point today and that's it
[1:35:47] I'll pick up a pen everybody there we're
[1:35:54] getting close to finish yes sir yes sir
[1:35:59] we getting closer everybody there up to
[1:36:03] chapter 10 verse 1 and there was a
[1:36:09] certain man accessory called Cornelius a
[1:36:12] Centurion of the band called the Italian
[1:36:15] band devout men and one that filled God
[1:36:18] with all his house which cared much
[1:36:20] armed to the people and prayed to God
[1:36:22] always he saw in a vision evidently
[1:36:25] about the 9:00 hour of the day an angel
[1:36:27] of the God of God coming to him and
[1:36:29] saying to him Cornelius and when he
[1:36:33] looked to him he was afraid and say what
[1:36:35] is he Lord and he said to him you pure
[1:36:39] prayer and your arm are come up for a
[1:36:42] memorial before God he even recognized
[1:36:45] the angel just like Paul recognized the
[1:36:47] pillar of fire Lord so this man was a
[1:36:49] believer he knew he was trained well job
[1:36:52] 2 verse 22 and they say Cornelius they
[1:36:57] Santilli on air just men remember that
[1:37:00] we the woman was a believer
[1:37:04] Cornelius was not a sinner a just man
[1:37:07] and wonderful God and of good report
[1:37:10] among all the nation of the Jews was
[1:37:12] warned from God by a holy angel to send
[1:37:15] for you into his own and to heal the
[1:37:17] world of you job 2 verse 25 and as Peter
[1:37:22] was coming in Cornelius met him and fell
[1:37:24] down at his feet and worship Him
[1:37:27] remember the book of Revelation the same
[1:37:31] answer that was showing John John fell
[1:37:34] at his feet
[1:37:35] you remember Peter and Cornelius
[1:37:40] same caliber the angel and the messenger
[1:37:45] and John same caliber watch clearly
[1:37:49] Peter but Peter took him up saying stand
[1:37:52] up I myself also I am what a man
[1:37:55] everybody there and as he talked with
[1:37:58] him he went and found many dauer come
[1:38:01] together there were many people there
[1:38:03] are you there verse 28 and he said to
[1:38:07] them you know how that is a lawful thing
[1:38:10] for a man that is a Jew to keep company
[1:38:12] or come to earth to one of another
[1:38:14] nation but God has
[1:38:16] me that I should not call any man common
[1:38:19] or unclean let's jump to verse 34 verse
[1:38:24] 34 then Peter opened his mouth and said
[1:38:26] of a truth I perceive that God is no
[1:38:30] respecter of her because he's pulling
[1:38:33] three people from every nation every day
[1:38:37] verse 34 but in every nation the jetta
[1:38:41] HIDA fear him and work righteousness is
[1:38:44] accepted with him job 2 verse 44 while
[1:38:49] Peter yet spoke this word the Holy Ghost
[1:38:52] fell and all or on all of them which
[1:38:55] heard the word and there were they of
[1:38:58] the circumcision which believed were
[1:39:00] astonished as many as came with Peter
[1:39:02] because that their holy because that on
[1:39:06] the Gentiles pour out the gift of the
[1:39:10] Holy Spirit for their heard them speak
[1:39:13] with in other word what happened in the
[1:39:15] day of Pentecost to Peter happen exactly
[1:39:18] to Cornelius but there he was not a
[1:39:22] different example experienced but a
[1:39:27] different pillar of fire the same pillar
[1:39:29] of fire that was with Moses Israel had
[1:39:32] access to it the same pillar of fire
[1:39:34] with brother Branham you have access to
[1:39:36] it
[1:39:37] same baptismal appear about past you
[1:39:40] have access to it that one God Jesus
[1:39:42] said you shall be baptized with the same
[1:39:45] baptism that I am baptized off let's go
[1:39:48] to up to chapter 11 the second chapter
[1:39:51] then we head to the airport if you dare
[1:39:55] you can say Amen and there and the
[1:39:57] Apostle and brethren that were in Judea
[1:40:00] heard that the Gentile had also received
[1:40:02] the Word of God and when Peter was come
[1:40:04] up to Jerusalem they or that were of the
[1:40:07] circumcision contended with them saying
[1:40:10] you went into men and circumcised and
[1:40:13] did eat with them everybody there they
[1:40:16] begins to condemn him let's go to verse
[1:40:18] 17 15 that's where we're going to stop
[1:40:22] as far as the scripture and as I began
[1:40:25] to speak Peter is explaining them the
[1:40:27] Holy Ghost fell on them
[1:40:29] as on on us and ER in other words this
[1:40:34] Gentile received the same experience
[1:40:37] like all of us in the upper room 16 then
[1:40:42] I remember I then we memorize the word
[1:40:46] of the Lord how that he said John indeed
[1:40:49] baptized with water but you shall be
[1:40:51] baptized with the Holy Ghost for as much
[1:40:54] then as God gave them gave them they
[1:40:58] like the exact same gift as he did to us
[1:41:03] who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:41:05] what was I that I could withstand God in
[1:41:09] other words the same experience that
[1:41:12] Peter has is the same express that was
[1:41:16] given to Cornelius everybody there but
[1:41:19] the first husband of Cornelius has to
[1:41:22] die
[1:41:23] Cornelius was in Italian he separated
[1:41:26] from this nation
[1:41:28] Italy and he was now a proselyte to the
[1:41:31] Jewish nation when the first husband
[1:41:33] died then God sent him leader your first
[1:41:37] husband must die
[1:41:38] Romans 7 trusting in God trusting that
[1:41:42] you have your Bible open everywhere now
[1:41:45] across the country we want to read
[1:41:47] closely now it seems like it's on
[1:41:49] marriage and divorce the Roman we read
[1:41:52] but he really is not to me it's a
[1:41:55] prophecy for the church in the last
[1:41:58] everybody there so the church in the
[1:42:01] last day so to be married to the second
[1:42:03] Adam Christ the word you must separate
[1:42:07] yourself by death from your first
