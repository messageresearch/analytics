[22:05] [Music]
[22:10] you're
[22:14] Oh help me no thank you this uh this
[22:29] next song I was I was driving home from
[22:32] work the other day and uh I laid this
[22:36] song for the Isaiah Brooks sings it and
[22:38] y'all might know it as more of a
[22:40] children's song a sunday-school song but
[22:42] I was singing it and uh and the Lord
[22:45] something just came over me and I just I
[22:48] almost started crying right there in my
[22:50] seat just thinking about the song is yes
[22:53] jesus loves me and I was thinking about
[22:55] how I'm not fathering myself but I know
[22:58] that when the time comes and I have a
[23:00] child I want to do everything I can for
[23:02] that child and everything within mine
[23:04] means that I can do for that child I'm
[23:06] gonna want to do it for that child and
[23:09] just to think how capable our Lord in
[23:12] heaven is and how he cares for us that
[23:14] he can do all things and he has our best
[23:17] interest at heart and you know he can
[23:20] meet all of our needs he can meet all of
[23:22] our wants but he knows what's best for
[23:24] us and that's why he you know sometimes
[23:26] we'll pray for something we'll wonder
[23:28] why we don't receive it but he knows
[23:29] what he's doing so I just thought about
[23:31] that and I think why should I worry why
[23:33] should I fear why should I be stressed
[23:35] why should I have any concern about life
[23:37] at all when I know that the God in
[23:41] heaven that holds my life in his hands
[23:43] and cares about me because he's my
[23:45] father in heaven he's got it all in
[23:48] control I don't have to worry about
[23:49] anything I don't have to worry about
[23:50] what I'm gonna eat tomorrow what I'm
[23:51] gonna do and I'm gonna give my best
[23:53] effort I'm gonna work hard I'm gonna do
[23:55] everything that I can do but in the end
[23:56] of the day I know God's got it all
[23:57] control and he has me in his hands and
[24:00] I'm just gonna walk in his footsteps and
[24:02] I know it'll be all right so y'all just
[24:04] join in with me on this like I said I
[24:05] know it might be a sunday-school song
[24:07] but it's it's dear to my heart and we'll
[24:09] just sing it tonight for the glory of
[24:11] God yes Jesus
[24:20] yes jesus loves me yes jesus and jesus

[30:30] we rejoice together with you as the will
[30:33] of God unfolds and providing you with
[30:35] leadership and a Shepherd to guide you
[30:37] and we just believe that God has a place
[30:40] for you to gather in worship so we
[30:42] believe that you'll have your own
[30:43] building and God will just continue to
[30:46] grow the character of the church which
[30:48] is its beauty and we're praying for you
[30:50] and we support you 100% and we're so
[30:53] happy to be together with you tonight as
[30:55] family and you have a church up there
[30:57] and it's actually in Newton but it's
[30:59] called Hickory Bible Tabernacle you have
[31:01] a church there that pulling for you
[31:03] praying for you
[31:04] rejoicing in your stand for the truth
[31:06] encouraged by your stand for truth
[31:08] hurting with you as you labor in the
[31:11] word and suffer for his namesake
[31:13] we're glad to be here tonight we'd love
[31:16] you very very much appreciate the
[31:18] invitation to be here I'd like to be
[31:20] reading from revelations chapter 21 and
[31:22] gonna read verses 1 to 11 and I have
[31:29] haven't had the privilege of ministering
[31:31] to you as an assembly and as a body here
[31:35] but I can say you must be one pulling a
[31:38] bunch of people because I just felt like
[31:40] I was being pulled all over the Bible
[31:41] and all over the Word of God and just I
[31:43] felt like my fits in the word I could
[31:45] just preach it that's how I felt but I'm
[31:47] but I knew I had to strike find that
[31:49] channel and I have really just a story I
[31:52] want to share with you and be able to
[31:53] take it you know from the beginning even
[31:55] to the place that we are now where God's
[31:57] taking us to but maybe just do it
[31:59] through a theme I don't want to get you
[32:01] nervous like we're gonna be here all
[32:02] night but you know you do stay overnight
[32:04] at hotels that's what hotels are for
[32:09] revelations chapter 21 verse 1 and we'll
[32:12] start to look at this together it says
[32:15] and I saw a new heaven and a new earth
[32:17] for the first heaven and the first Earth
[32:19] were passed away and there was no more
[32:21] sea and I John saw the holy city New
[32:25] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[32:27] heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[32:30] her husband so when John sees the New
[32:33] Jerusalem what he is struck with is an
[32:36] inspiration and what immediately comes
[32:39] up in his heart and how he begins to
[32:40] describe the city as he describes it as
[32:43] a bride adorned for her husband and
[32:45] that's that's what he feels when he sees
[32:47] it and now the reason why this would
[32:50] become more clear as we Minister the
[32:51] reason why that's what he feels when he
[32:54] sees it
[32:54] is because that's what is represented in
[32:57] the New Jerusalem is the wife but the
[33:00] bride has said when a man chooses a
[33:01] woman he's he's choosing what his future
[33:04] home will be so in the wife is the
[33:07] mystery of the future home so when John
[33:10] sees the future home he says I see it as
[33:13] a bride adorned for her husband so he
[33:16] says and I heard a great voice out of
[33:17] heaven saying behold the tabernacle of
[33:20] God is with men and he will dwell with
[33:22] him and they shall be his people and God
[33:25] himself shall be with them and be their
[33:26] God God shall wipe away all tears from
[33:28] their eyes and there should be no more
[33:30] death neither sorrow nor crying neither
[33:32] shall there be any more pain for the
[33:34] former things are passed away and he
[33:37] that sat upon the throne said behold I
[33:39] make all things new and he said unto me
[33:41] write for these words are true and
[33:43] faithful and he said unto me it is done
[33:46] I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and
[33:49] the end I will give unto him that thirst
[33:52] of the thirst of the fountain of water
[33:54] of life freely
[33:55] he that overcometh shall inherit all
[33:57] things I notice in the church ages there
[34:00] 7 he that overcomes but now there's an
[34:02] eighth he that overcometh shall inherit
[34:04] all things and I will be his God and he
[34:06] shall be my son but the fearful and
[34:09] unbelieving and the abominable and
[34:11] murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers
[34:12] and idolaters and all Liars shall have
[34:14] their part in the lake which burneth
[34:15] with fire and brimstone which is the
[34:17] second death now notice how this
[34:19] transitions
[34:21] again and there came unto me one of the
[34:22] seven angels which had the seven vials
[34:24] full of the seven last plagues and
[34:26] talked with me saying come hither I'll
[34:28] show you the bride the Lambs wife so in
[34:31] verse two he sees the city the New
[34:34] Jerusalem and he's immediately struck
[34:35] with this inspiration to say as a bride
[34:38] adorned for her husband
[34:39] now he's told he's going to see the
[34:41] bride and notice what happens and he
[34:43] carried me away in the spirit to a great
[34:45] and high mountain and showed me that
[34:47] great city the holy Jerusalem descending
[34:49] out of heaven from God so when he's told
[34:52] he's to see a wife he sees the city so
[34:54] the if I could say this the bride is the
[34:57] first manifestation of the New Jerusalem
[34:59] because God chooses her to be a wife
[35:01] therefore she holds the mystery of the
[35:04] of the New Jerusalem this she is the
[35:06] holy city she is the dwelling place of
[35:08] God so when he's told to see the wife
[35:10] how he sees the city when he saw the
[35:12] city he was struck with the image of a
[35:14] wife and he says having the glory of God
[35:17] we know that the woman is the glory of
[35:18] the man having the glory of God and her
[35:21] light so now he's speaking of her in the
[35:23] city and female gender and her light was
[35:25] likened to a stone most precious even
[35:27] like a Jasper stone clear as crystal and
[35:31] if we could just bow our heads in prayer
[35:32] our gracious Heavenly Father lord I pray
[35:35] that you just take this this divine
[35:37] presence which is here now only you
[35:39] could come and sanctify a building as
[35:41] you have only you could sanctify hearts
[35:44] of your people as you have only you
[35:46] could be behind an atmosphere like this
[35:48] and anticipation like this so what I
[35:50] pray that you would come now take these
[35:52] open heart take these willing vessels
[35:55] Lord as you've used our brother and
[35:56] preparing the the atmosphere by
[35:58] leadership of worship and I believe you
[36:00] honored his sincerity Lord you honored
[36:02] the simplicity of the instruments the
[36:04] simplicity of the voices now come and in
[36:07] the simplicity of your word make
[36:09] yourself known may you speak to this
[36:11] body in a way that places them that
[36:14] strengthens them that inspires them Lord
[36:16] to go further and we commit it to you
[36:18] now father praying that you take control
[36:19] of this service for your glory in the
[36:21] name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray
[36:22] amen and you may have your seats
[36:25] are we starting to get the sound
[36:27] levelled out a little bit just you do
[36:30] what you need to do if you have to hand
[36:31] me another mic if I have to raise my
[36:33] voice I'm not going to get him
[36:34] Barriss you're not going to make me feel
[36:36] uncomfortable I'm with family and so
[36:39] there's if the devil thought he was
[36:40] going to embarrass me or get me feeling
[36:42] backwards tonight he forgot that I was
[36:44] going to be with family and so we don't
[36:47] mind if we have to change things up or
[36:49] do things a little bit different I want
[36:51] to give the title the unfolding of the
[36:53] invisible the unfolding of the invisible
[36:57] and and just I just want to pour my
[37:00] heart out I have a lot of maybe quotes
[37:02] here in different scriptures and just
[37:04] try to follow the you just kind of pull
[37:06] me you pull me where the Lord would lead
[37:08] and we'll just follow we'll just follow
[37:10] that leading and you tell me when I'm
[37:12] done and we know the Lord will get the
[37:14] glory but I want to start with laying
[37:16] this foundation as we read from
[37:18] revelations chapter 21 we see a woman
[37:20] being described as a city I'll show you
[37:24] the bride the Lambs wife and so the
[37:27] bride is not a girlfriend
[37:29] she is not a fiancee she is a wife and
[37:32] this is something that John is
[37:34] identifying and we're living in bride
[37:36] time this is in church time this is
[37:39] bride time brother Branham had just a
[37:41] few places he's very particular about
[37:43] his language and even when he's
[37:44] preaching this seals heel so I'll call
[37:46] you bride that you'll understand
[37:48] realizing that there's a distinction
[37:50] associated with church in church ages
[37:53] but there's another distinction
[37:54] associated with Brian and bride age and
[37:56] so we're living in a time where it's
[37:58] bride time it's bright light and he
[38:01] speaks of the bride and says she is to
[38:02] come on the scene in the last days and
[38:05] it's a time and a place which is
[38:06] appointed to her so she is to come on
[38:09] the scene and we're living in u19 time
[38:12] we're living in a time where the
[38:14] marriage has come and if you're looking
[38:17] Christ as the mystery of God revealed he
[38:19] is teaching us that the headship to the
[38:22] body has come and it is uniting now with
[38:25] the body it's becoming one unit and so
[38:27] now it's husband and wife United
[38:29] together and in that there is no more
[38:32] waiting there is no more there is no
[38:34] more being a spouse and wait there is no
[38:37] more girlfriend or fiance who's waiting
[38:39] but now the headship has come
[38:41] that's a vindication that the rapture is
[38:43] at hand and he says it's now uniting
[38:46] with the body and
[38:48] that's the time that we're living in now
[38:50] but the random in the message invisible
[38:52] Union says the word that fell on the day
[38:54] of Pentecost will not work in this day
[38:57] he says no sir that was for Pentecost
[39:00] this is for the bride now when he says
[39:03] that was for Pentecost he's not doing
[39:05] that as a something dismissive well that
[39:08] was for Pentecost and if we're not
[39:11] careful we can in in our innocence and
[39:15] even in our defense of the message we
[39:17] can become dismissive of Pentecost well
[39:20] we must realize that if Pentecost wasn't
[39:22] who she was we can't be who we are and
[39:25] so in order for there to be a bride age
[39:27] there has to have been a Pentecostal age
[39:29] and it has to be a true age and a
[39:32] vindicated age and a genuine move of God
[39:35] and so the bride is what follows the
[39:38] outpouring of Pentecost and with the
[39:40] last order of the Reformation which the
[39:42] Laodicean Church age restoration the
[39:44] gift the baptism oligos was the last
[39:47] order of the Reformation so in brother
[39:49] Brown says the word that fell on the day
[39:50] of Pentecost will not work in this day
[39:52] and that was for Pentecost this isn't a
[39:54] slight this isn't a criticism
[39:57] he's just placing the ages he's placing
[39:59] the truth to those ages he said this is
[40:02] for the bride going home of the bride he
[40:06] says we got something different now it
[40:10] doesn't mean that they had something we
[40:12] don't have because we've been restored
[40:15] back to everything they had but yet
[40:17] we're in a different promise in this age
[40:19] we're not at the base of Mount Zion
[40:21] which Paul brought the church to but
[40:23] we're at the capstone in the climax of
[40:25] Mount Zion so he says he says this is
[40:28] for the going of the bride we've got
[40:29] something different the Pentecostals
[40:32] represented that again
[40:33] so the genuine Pentecostals not then not
[40:36] the group that went back into formalism
[40:38] not the group that went into
[40:39] organization not the group that went
[40:41] into fanaticism not the group that fell
[40:43] away just 15 years after it begin to
[40:45] start but those genuine god-fearing the
[40:48] Holy Ghost filled Pentecostals they
[40:50] represented that again and so we have a
[40:53] chain of inheritance that it back to the
[40:56] beginning through that Pentecostal move
[40:58] but he's placed in the bride agency
[41:01] thing different he says the Pentecostals
[41:03] represented that again we are in the
[41:05] bride age and brother branham makes the
[41:09] bride the the Pentecostal age synonymous
[41:11] and one with the Pentecostal age is the
[41:14] Laodicean age he makes them the same but
[41:16] now he's identifying something different
[41:18] in this Laodicean time he said this is
[41:21] not a Pentecostal age this is a
[41:22] latter-day age this is the bride age you
[41:26] know this is the day when the Son of Man
[41:28] is revealed and the revelation of the
[41:30] Son of Man which is also scripturally
[41:32] the coming of the Son of Man it involves
[41:34] the marriage of the bride to her mate
[41:37] the revelation of the Son of Man is not
[41:39] just a son of man revealing the son of
[41:41] man and contained within the ministry of
[41:44] a son of man but rather the the the
[41:47] revelation the son of man is a union
[41:49] between the bridegroom and his bride
[41:51] he's to return back into his people
[41:54] again it's when he gets into your flesh
[41:56] it's when he's it's that's the
[41:58] revelation of the Son of Man is a union
[42:00] of the word with his bride and brother
[42:04] Branham says an invisible union all that
[42:05] spiritual union of Christ and His Church
[42:07] now what is the spiritual union of
[42:10] Christ and His Church now when the flesh
[42:12] is becoming word and the word is
[42:14] becoming flesh manifested vindicated
[42:16] just what the Bible said would happen in
[42:19] this day it's happening day by day a man
[42:22] and you're the proof of that you're the
[42:24] proof and it's happening day by day
[42:26] because it was not just a union in 1965
[42:29] but it's a union in 2020 where the union
[42:32] is transpiring day by day and so it
[42:35] brings upon the scene the Lambs wife it
[42:38] is a it is a spiritual marriage a
[42:40] spiritual union now the spiritual
[42:44] marriage union is taking place right now
[42:46] it's unseen but it's real and Christ as
[42:50] the mischief God revealed he says and
[42:53] now the Christ and the church is just
[42:55] being made known and that's interesting
[42:58] Christ in the church is just being made
[43:00] known to even help you understand that
[43:03] you need the help maybe just to help me
[43:05] get it out I'll just use that word but
[43:07] to look at it in the way to understand
[43:08] what he means by Christ in the church is
[43:11] just being made known you have to
[43:13] realize that Christ
[43:14] been put out of the church in the
[43:16] Laodicean age he's a fugitive in his own
[43:18] church there's something that happens in
[43:20] the Laodicean age after the last order
[43:23] the Reformation after you have a tongue
[43:24] talking Holy Spirit baptized body of
[43:27] people with signs and wonders and gifts
[43:29] manifesting within just a few short
[43:31] years they organize and begin to die in
[43:34] Satan's like I've got this I got this
[43:36] thing licked
[43:36] because now Christ becomes a fugitive in
[43:39] his own church and revelations tells us
[43:41] Christ is on the outside of the church
[43:44] but there's a revelations 320 that comes
[43:47] behold I stand at the door and knock and
[43:49] so now that's how Christ comes into you
[43:52] and us and to him at that day ye shall
[43:54] know that I am you and you and me and
[43:56] then this is the revelation that comes
[43:58] forth at that day when the revelation is
[44:00] made known
[44:01] so that's what he's identified Lisa's
[44:03] truck the church is just being made
[44:05] known he said the whole thing is the
[44:08] revelation of God to take heed back to
[44:11] her right position again with her
[44:13] husband well it's the purpose of Christ
[44:16] now being in the midst of his bride
[44:17] what's the purpose of this revelation to
[44:20] bring the woman back to her right
[44:21] position again with her husband now he
[44:25] uses that language to take e which is
[44:27] the bride back to the right position
[44:29] again with her husband her right
[44:32] position is with her husband then he
[44:34] says the threefold purpose of God's
[44:36] great mystery is revealed
[44:39] so the threefold purpose of God's great
[44:42] mystery is revealed God manifested in
[44:44] Christ Christ manifested in the church
[44:47] in order to so now these don't have
[44:51] independent these aren't independent
[44:53] operations but these are things that are
[44:55] linked and changed together God
[44:57] manifested in Christ now Christ
[44:59] manifested in church his church in order
[45:01] to redeem the lost eat back to the
[45:04] original condition in the Garden of Eden
[45:07] so it's a right position but it's also a
[45:10] condition and this is the part that just
[45:13] gets me so excited because when you
[45:15] begin to think about it about position
[45:17] and condition it takes us out of the
[45:20] thought of a realm or a location it's a
[45:23] position and condition not just it's not
[45:25] a location but
[45:26] a position it's not a location it's a
[45:29] it's a it's a relation and it is a
[45:32] position and a condition and so the
[45:35] Union with the bridegroom is part of
[45:38] coming back to the Eden position the
[45:40] union with the bridegroom is part of
[45:42] coming back to a Garden of Eden
[45:43] condition so when you have Christ being
[45:46] manifested a bride being manifested and
[45:49] they two becoming one and united it
[45:52] resurrects or brings back or redeems a
[45:55] Garden of Eden position or a Garden of
[45:57] Eden condition so I don't have to look
[46:02] out and be discouraged by the Laodicean
[46:04] all I have to do is see the revelation
[46:07] of the mystery that the two have become
[46:08] one to see that there's an Eden
[46:10] condition being brought back and so when
[46:16] brother Branham is showing us these
[46:18] things in these sermons that is an
[46:21] invisible he says it's an invisible you
[46:23] not a physical Union as an invisible
[46:26] unit the earthly bride with her unseen
[46:29] bridegroom how there can be there could
[46:32] be a mental battle with this there can
[46:35] be there could be a wrestling with the
[46:37] the physic we want something that is
[46:40] tactile that we can touch that we can
[46:42] feel we want to be able to see things
[46:43] and describe it and many times that's
[46:45] how we were dated towards physical
[46:48] manifestations or signs they're given
[46:51] but science can signs can be pointing
[46:54] you just something and science could be
[46:56] revealing something but if you get hung
[46:58] up on the sign you'll never get to what
[46:59] is pointing to could you imagine if I
[47:02] the first sign I saw for Hilton Garden
[47:04] Inn and gastonia if I just stop there
[47:05] and say here we are here's the sign it
[47:08] says here this is the sign for Hilton
[47:10] Garden I wouldn't be where I was right
[47:11] now but if I followed the sign it got me
[47:14] to where I'm supposed to be and so we
[47:17] could be looking to signs and physical
[47:19] manifestations and they miss the
[47:21] spiritual manifestation of what's taking
[47:23] place so we can struggle with this idea
[47:27] well there's a there's a union taking
[47:29] place there's an actual wedding that's
[47:31] transpiring right now but it's spiritual
[47:33] and so this is my key that I'm just want
[47:36] to keep emphasizing tonight God
[47:39] unfolding
[47:40] from the invisible God working from the
[47:43] invisible his process of making the
[47:46] invisible visible his process of taking
[47:50] a word which is a thought in his heart
[47:52] first and this this logos and this
[47:54] desire that is invisible and unseen and
[47:57] his process of bringing it to an
[47:59] expression from going unseen to seen and
[48:04] I want to use this principle of this
[48:07] concept to understand the marriage of
[48:10] the bride to Christ the this I want I
[48:14] want to use this principle of the
[48:15] unfolding of the visible to understand
[48:17] the coming of the son of man the
[48:19] revealing of the son of man because this
[48:21] is a theme that brother Branham uses in
[48:23] the message and he identifies in the
[48:25] message invisible Union as he's
[48:27] preaching this and he starts to look at
[48:29] the history coming to an end
[48:31] he begins to speak about the physical
[48:33] return of the Lord Jesus to take a
[48:35] physical people by his cleansing blood
[48:37] and so he's looking at one day where
[48:40] it's going to be a physical return of
[48:42] the Lord Jesus with a physical people in
[48:44] the Millennium but now there's an
[48:47] invisible union and he and he's tried to
[48:50] lay this foundation so he looked there
[48:52] is going to be one day a physical coming
[48:54] and he says that's what most people are
[48:56] looking to now his third coming and
[48:58] because they're looking for the aspects
[49:00] in the the characteristics of his third
[49:02] coming they're going to miss him in a
[49:03] second coming because they're looking
[49:06] for a manifestation that will only be in
[49:08] his third coming and so he has to take
[49:10] time to bring this up an invisible Union
[49:13] and he starts using this language that
[49:15] there would be a royal bride to the
[49:17] Royal promised son this is a different
[49:19] Kingdom this isn't a natural seed this
[49:21] is a royal seed he says it won't be a
[49:24] natural seat it'll be a spiritual seed
[49:26] there's to be a spiritual bride raised
[49:28] up and he talked about how our natural
[49:31] life here is the result of being natural
[49:33] human beings associated together in fact
[49:36] and this does the language he's using an
[49:38] invisible Union because it really should
[49:41] be the right life to begin with but it's
[49:42] perverted by the natural birth so the
[49:46] physical perverted the way that we were
[49:47] supposed to come originally he talks
[49:50] about how your spiritual death separates
[49:51] you from your first Union and you have
[49:53] to be born
[49:54] to a new spiritual union talks about the
[49:57] old look of your natural you but then he
[49:59] says your your new bride your new life
[50:02] is in the Lamb's Book of Life
[50:04] your marriage certificate hallelujah
[50:06] where your true eternal germ from the
[50:08] beginning takes hold
[50:09] you're not only forgiven but you're
[50:11] justified justified Romans 5:1 says
[50:13] therefore being justified by faith this
[50:16] is a spiritual justification physical
[50:20] sense but by faith and so he's using
[50:25] this I very quickly went through that
[50:26] just to emphasize that in the invisible
[50:28] union brother branham's taking going to
[50:30] great lengths to show you have the
[50:32] physical side you have the natural side
[50:33] but I'm talking about the spiritual side
[50:35] I'm talking about the that the royal
[50:38] seed so in the unfolding of the
[50:42] invisible the unfolding of God and his
[50:43] plan and his purpose I want to look at
[50:46] this principle in order to better
[50:48] understand the manifestation of the word
[50:50] today and I want to begin and may God
[50:53] just give me help because it's just a
[50:55] picture that I'm looking at and I want
[50:56] to be able to describe it to you
[50:58] I've been pondering the phrase for the
[51:01] last two months or so the phrase is in
[51:04] the beginning on how you have different
[51:07] places in scripture where there's in the
[51:09] beginning but we can by the word go back
[51:11] before the beginning and before the
[51:14] beginning there was Elohim he was one
[51:16] that was dwelling alone and there there
[51:19] was only Elohim that means there was no
[51:21] space there was no time there was no
[51:25] light there was no matter if we were to
[51:27] say that yet that God was in this room
[51:30] alone you would immediately begin to
[51:32] think of space you'd be thinking
[51:33] distance and you think height and three
[51:35] dimensionally and you would imagine a
[51:37] person with surrounded by by atmosphere
[51:42] in light but that's not how God was God
[51:44] was not in a place God was the only
[51:46] thing that's very hard for us to
[51:49] understand it there was just God there
[51:51] was no place he would reach there was no
[51:53] place he would go sit it was just God
[51:55] dwelling alone with this sauce he was
[51:57] the always existing beam Colossians 1:15
[52:01] describes him as the invisible God first
[52:04] Timothy 1:17 called the king eternal
[52:07] immortal
[52:08] invisible the only wise God so he was
[52:11] the invisible God and that's all that he
[52:13] was it was only God but in him were
[52:17] thoughts and in him were attributes and
[52:20] these thoughts and attributes were real
[52:22] and eternal they were they had substance
[52:25] they were not like our thoughts that
[52:27] could be fleeting they're not like our
[52:28] thoughts and purposes that may never be
[52:30] fulfilled but his thoughts were real
[52:32] they were eternal I'm the very sensual
[52:35] thought of his entire being and a very
[52:38] hard purpose that he had before anything
[52:40] was formed as he desired to have another
[52:43] expression of himself that he could have
[52:45] fellowship with he desired to have a
[52:48] bride of his choosing so if you could
[52:51] just imagine in the beginning there was
[52:53] nothing but God and this God wanted to
[52:57] have a help he wanted to have a bride he
[52:59] wanted to have a wife he wanted have a
[53:00] bride of his choosing and so he forms a
[53:03] low-cost there's nothing that you can
[53:05] see nothing expressed just an invisible
[53:08] God but now he forms a logos and it was
[53:11] this very passion and desire to have a
[53:13] bride that gave birth to that body that
[53:16] gave birth to that theophany that gave
[53:18] birth to that logos because he had to
[53:20] have that expression first before there
[53:22] could be a bride he realized if he would
[53:25] have brought a bride forth first she
[53:26] would have saw nothing but he had to
[53:30] bring forth the logos first and the law
[53:32] expression of the Oh God think of this
[53:34] in the logos was the wife and but he had
[53:39] to he had to have a way of unfolding
[53:41] this mystery so when he brings forth the
[53:43] logos
[53:43] that's the first expression of Christ
[53:46] and the first original expression of his
[53:48] wife because she was in him in the
[53:50] beginning it's from this low gosh
[53:55] theophany that he begins to create he
[53:56] creates a supernatural realm he creates
[53:59] a dimension of angels in an order of
[54:01] worship and a hierarchy and then he
[54:03] begins and he's doing these things by
[54:05] his spoken word and he begins to create
[54:06] now there's the invisible God who's now
[54:09] formed himself into a logos and this is
[54:11] the God God condescending down because
[54:14] then he creates another order of angels
[54:15] but in how he creates another order and
[54:18] it's the
[54:18] earthly order we know now it's a
[54:20] dimension of life and time and space
[54:22] it's a dimension of matter it's the
[54:25] earth and the heavens and the things
[54:27] that we know now and it's God's purpose
[54:29] in doing that the reason why he created
[54:31] the earth is to get a bride out of it
[54:33] these are things that were taught in the
[54:35] message so it's a process of God
[54:38] achieving a bride it began with him him
[54:41] forming himself into a logos and the
[54:44] logos was a visible expression of the
[54:46] invisible and in this with the off
[54:49] anybody's we said it is establish a
[54:51] dimension with beings called angels and
[54:53] that worship God and serve God then he
[54:55] created things that we now know with
[54:57] five senses things that can be touched
[54:59] and seen and handled and smelling and
[55:01] this is God's pattern a beginning
[55:04] invisible and unfolding to the visible
[55:06] God's pattern in the beginning was to be
[55:09] invisible spiritual and then the
[55:13] invisible God formed into a logos and
[55:15] then expressed in his creation so then
[55:19] when God begins to create Adam it is God
[55:22] expressing his pattern again of
[55:24] unfolding from invisible to physical
[55:26] it's God once again is expressing his
[55:29] pattern of starting with something
[55:30] spiritual unseen spiritual - material he
[55:34] says in Genesis 1:27 God created man in
[55:36] his own image in the image of God
[55:38] created he him and so when in a woman
[55:42] was hidden in him at this time male and
[55:45] female created he them and we know that
[55:48] Adam was first spiritual he was not
[55:51] physical he was not flesh because he was
[55:53] made in the image of God John 4:24 tells
[55:56] us that God is a spirit so if he was
[55:59] made in the image of God he was first
[56:00] made a spirit being brother Branham says
[56:03] God making Adam and Eve at the same time
[56:06] the only thing he made was the
[56:07] supernatural the spirit Adam in the
[56:10] spirit Eve the man and woman then he put
[56:12] Adam in here he says it wasn't good and
[56:15] when he says that it wasn't good he said
[56:16] it wasn't good for man to be alone he
[56:18] says see it's God's picture unfolding
[56:21] all the time what did Adam represent on
[56:23] earth he represented God how was it that
[56:26] God seen Adam knew it wasn't good for
[56:28] him to be alone because now he
[56:30] she's a mirror image of himself being
[56:32] the highest in heaven with angels and
[56:34] Dominion and authority but yet without a
[56:37] wife so he sees Adam on earth and his
[56:39] kingdom in his domain he says I see me
[56:42] I'm looking at myself in a mirror it's
[56:44] not good that Adam would be alone in his
[56:46] Dominion like it's not good for me to be
[56:49] able to mine Dominion I will achieve to
[56:51] myself a bride so our report shadow her
[56:54] first in my son Adam it's God's picture
[57:00] folding all the time he says it's just
[57:02] God's picture and fully God unfolding
[57:04] himself
[57:05] so it wasn't picked our picture of Adam
[57:07] it was God's picture so as it says in
[57:12] Genesis 2:7 8 and the Lord God formed
[57:14] man of the dust he was created first
[57:17] spiritual he was created first
[57:19] supernatural above natural but now he
[57:21] forms man out of the dust of the ground
[57:23] and breathed into his nostrils the
[57:24] breath of life and man became a living
[57:26] soul
[57:28] what is God expressing here he went from
[57:31] invisible from not existing to existing
[57:33] spiritually to now existence in the
[57:36] flesh and then immediately he says and
[57:41] the Lord God planted a garden which
[57:43] means he says eastward or in the
[57:45] beginning Easter it also means in the
[57:48] big thing eastward in Eden so when he
[57:50] plants this garden eastward in Eden he
[57:53] is already foreshadowing and portraying
[57:55] the bride which is in Adam you get song
[57:58] a psalmist says of my garden my spouse
[58:00] and so the garden is representative of a
[58:03] spouse its representative a wife and so
[58:06] he has already he has already planted in
[58:08] the beginning of Eden and Eden means
[58:11] God's delight so he has already planted
[58:14] in cause delight a woman or garden
[58:16] foreshadowing that he has already sold
[58:18] the bride in the earth before Satan ever
[58:22] came to it before Satan could prevent it
[58:25] or defy God had already sold the seed he
[58:33] had already planted a garden eastward in
[58:35] Eden this is my God my sister my spouse
[58:38] and they says I am
[58:40] into my garden and what does it say in
[58:43] Genesis to 8 the Lord God planted a
[58:46] garden eastward in Eden that's
[58:48] figurative of the bride and it says and
[58:50] there he put the man whom he had formed
[58:53] hallelujah showing that God will put in
[58:56] him the man in the garden that he is
[58:58] formed and now the spiritual is physical
[59:10] now the supernaturals tangible it's been
[59:13] developed and this is the world that God
[59:16] loved they never thought about that God
[59:20] so loved the world that He gave His only
[59:22] begotten Son that whosoever believeth in
[59:24] him should not perish but have
[59:25] everlasting life
[59:26] that that's this is the world that God
[59:28] loved otherwise you have conflict when
[59:31] the Bible says he that loveth the world
[59:32] is not of my father he that loveth the
[59:36] world it cannot be in harmony and one
[59:38] with the father because all that is in
[59:39] the world is lost of the eyes let's
[59:41] invest in the private life as he tells
[59:43] us to love not the world for the love of
[59:46] the world is not of the Father but it
[59:48] says for God so loved the world he's
[59:49] talking about two different worlds the
[59:51] world that God loved was this world
[59:53] that's garden to me in this original
[59:55] condition this is the world that God
[59:57] loved the world that foreshadowed the
[1:00:00] bride the world that he took the man
[1:00:01] that he had formed and put him in the
[1:00:03] mid syrup that's the world that God
[1:00:05] loved and what did that garden
[1:00:09] foreshadow a bride that has already
[1:00:11] planted in Satan's Eden that Christ
[1:00:15] Himself comes into same thought he got
[1:00:18] one over on God but God says you're just
[1:00:20] falling right into my trap because what
[1:00:23] you have done is you have snuck into my
[1:00:24] Eden and you're possessed a vessel that
[1:00:27] preached a lie that caused a woman to
[1:00:29] fall and you did that in mighty but I
[1:00:32] will one day come down into your eating
[1:00:35] and I will inhabit a man who will have a
[1:00:38] message that'll raise up a woman that
[1:00:40] will not
[1:00:41] bring death but bring life and triumph
[1:00:43] over death what a lot of that happened
[1:00:46] in the beginning because he knew how it
[1:00:48] would end so then when God took Adam and
[1:01:02] he looked at me with Genesis 280 says
[1:01:03] it's not good for man to be alone I will
[1:01:05] make it help me for him things one
[1:01:08] opposite but equal it means a mirror
[1:01:12] image of himself one that's
[1:01:14] complementary equal but opposite in the
[1:01:18] beginning the woman was co-equal with
[1:01:20] them she was equal but opposite
[1:01:22] complementary to his purpose and he had
[1:01:24] a purpose be fruitful multiply and
[1:01:26] replace earth so there had to be a
[1:01:28] mirror image that could complement that
[1:01:30] purpose couldn't be another man that
[1:01:32] would never work I'll listen be
[1:01:35] spiritual I hadn't to be a woman that
[1:01:36] could produce a man in His image it had
[1:01:39] to be a woman that could bring forth
[1:01:41] another son just like their widow so it
[1:01:43] couldn't be different in reflection it
[1:01:48] had to be complementary I mean as soon
[1:01:54] as God says that it's not good that man
[1:01:55] should be alone he starts describing
[1:01:57] Adam doing the work and all the beasts
[1:02:00] of the field came before Adam and he
[1:02:01] begin to name all the animals and it's
[1:02:03] not it's not a change of scenery it's an
[1:02:06] explanation I will make him a help meet
[1:02:08] because there's a work that Adam can do
[1:02:11] by himself but there's a work he can't
[1:02:13] do by himself he can name the animals
[1:02:16] but what he can't do is bring life forth
[1:02:18] unless he has a wife so he declares a
[1:02:20] work that he did but now after he does
[1:02:22] that work he has to bring forth the
[1:02:24] woman in order to fulfill his purpose to
[1:02:27] be fruitful multiply and replenish the
[1:02:29] earth what does he foreshadowing the
[1:02:30] bride that God raises up in this last
[1:02:32] days to finish his work there was a work
[1:02:34] that he did in his first coming that he
[1:02:36] cannot finish and fulfill in his own so
[1:02:38] he now will in the end work bought and
[1:02:40] through his bride to finish his work
[1:02:55] how many Congolese do we have here
[1:02:58] tonight raise your hand just a couple
[1:03:01] because I'm just gonna who's all used to
[1:03:03] a three-hour 4 hours service
[1:03:05] my goodness you're pulling so good you
[1:03:08] said brother and you go too fast well
[1:03:09] you're pulling too hard you're just
[1:03:10] dragging me everywhere so then when he
[1:03:18] takes in Genesis 2:22 and he takes this
[1:03:20] woman out of the man brother BAM says
[1:03:22] showing here portraying the bride the
[1:03:26] whole thing is expressing something and
[1:03:28] now he brings out in the flesh the woman
[1:03:31] and so he is a God who and from being
[1:03:34] totally invisible to having a perfect
[1:03:38] fit of physical manifestation of himself
[1:03:40] a king and his queen in a domain went
[1:03:44] from invisible to physical but there was
[1:03:49] more to unfold there was more to God's
[1:03:53] purpose God's purpose was not just to
[1:03:55] have a man and a woman but that they
[1:03:57] would Bri forth and the purpose of the
[1:04:01] woman was never fulfilled but the
[1:04:04] purpose of the woman will be fulfilled
[1:04:06] through the bride the purpose of the
[1:04:09] first church was never fulfilled but the
[1:04:11] purpose of the church will be fulfilled
[1:04:13] in the bride that's how he could say we
[1:04:16] have something different but he uses a
[1:04:20] phrase in Christ as the mystery God
[1:04:22] revealed he says the three full purpose
[1:04:24] of God made manifest in Adam and Eve and
[1:04:28] ponder that the threefold purpose of God
[1:04:30] was already made manifest in Adam and
[1:04:33] Eve the threefold purpose of Christ God
[1:04:37] being made manifest in Christ
[1:04:39] manifesting sonship Christ having
[1:04:41] preeminence in the church which
[1:04:42] manifests bride in order to bring them
[1:04:44] back to a Garden of Eden condition he
[1:04:46] says the threefold purpose of God was
[1:04:48] manifested in Adam and the woman it was
[1:04:52] the this was the purpose of God it was
[1:04:54] in a hidden mystery
[1:04:56] but again it was made manifest it was
[1:04:59] hidden in the simplicity a man and a
[1:05:02] woman under a promise to reproduce the
[1:05:04] Sun under promise to bring forth a man
[1:05:07] in the image of Adam to bring back the
[1:05:09] original again and so the original free
[1:05:13] fall purpose of God made manifest in
[1:05:15] Adam and Eve
[1:05:17] now when God when God fashioned that it
[1:05:22] wasn't he just didn't want to have like
[1:05:25] a little playground he wanted to have a
[1:05:27] bride of his own choosing the invisible
[1:05:31] God desired to have another expression
[1:05:32] of himself so what he's represented in
[1:05:35] though in the woman is a representation
[1:05:37] of what he wants for himself what he
[1:05:40] gave Adam is what he's going to give
[1:05:41] himself he wanted a bride of equality he
[1:05:45] wanted a companion he wanted a ride that
[1:05:48] would love him for who he is I think
[1:05:51] about this he wanted a bride that would
[1:05:53] love him for who he was originally what
[1:05:55] was he originally just the word what was
[1:05:58] he originally he was invisible
[1:06:02] who wouldn't fall in love with a tall
[1:06:05] dark and handsome rich man who wouldn't
[1:06:08] fall in love with a wealthy King and a
[1:06:10] man with me two domains but how about
[1:06:12] fall in love with somebody that you have
[1:06:14] not seen how about trusting somebody you
[1:06:18] have not felt or handled but the only
[1:06:23] way that God could achieve his heart's
[1:06:25] desire was to manifest the hidden to
[1:06:29] manifest the unseen to give expression
[1:06:31] to what he had in his heart so brother
[1:06:34] Bram says in Christ is the mystery God
[1:06:36] revealed he what he wanted to do he
[1:06:38] loved fatherhood for he was a father and
[1:06:40] the only way he could express it was to
[1:06:43] become a son of men so and God loves
[1:06:47] something he cannot just have it he has
[1:06:49] to become something so God loved
[1:06:51] fatherhood so he couldn't just becoming
[1:06:54] a son and become a father he had to
[1:06:57] become a son himself in order to be a
[1:06:59] father
[1:07:01] hallelujah the only way he can express
[1:07:04] fatherhood the only way he could be a
[1:07:06] is the first he became a son so he
[1:07:09] became the son of man in order to be a
[1:07:11] father
[1:07:13] hallelujah and if he's going to be a
[1:07:16] bride if he's going to be a husband he
[1:07:18] has to become a bride
[1:07:24] so it's this original Elohim who's
[1:07:26] becoming and so God becomes the Christ
[1:07:31] it becomes through his word so on the
[1:07:34] threefold purpose God becomes manifested
[1:07:37] in the Sun then if he comes in
[1:07:38] preeminence in his bride in order to
[1:07:40] bring back to eating and Eden God was a
[1:07:44] living reality he was an unfolding
[1:07:47] mystery perfect love perfect
[1:07:49] understanding the love of God no death
[1:07:51] around them at all
[1:07:53] there was complete harmony between the
[1:07:55] spiritual and the physical that which
[1:07:58] was invisible isn't harmonized in the
[1:08:01] flesh and the invisible God has a
[1:08:02] perfect harmony where he could come down
[1:08:04] the cool of the evening and he can walk
[1:08:06] with Adam and he can walk with Eve I
[1:08:09] said it wasn't just a physical
[1:08:11] manifestation he said he heard the voice
[1:08:13] of the Lord walking in the garden
[1:08:16] so there was a voice he could hear and
[1:08:18] then it says Adam ran from his presence
[1:08:20] it wasn't a being but it was a
[1:08:22] revelation and if you and a harmony with
[1:08:25] the supernatural where the voice
[1:08:27] declared his word and the boys declared
[1:08:30] his presence without a beam and Adam
[1:08:32] fled from the presence of God but it was
[1:08:38] perfectly in harmony now you follow me
[1:08:42] in the store I'm just telling your story
[1:08:43] tonight now in this beautiful image
[1:08:49] which God had made
[1:08:51] when the woman sinned harmony is broken
[1:08:54] and God becomes mysterious again I
[1:08:58] pondered this deeply because it's then
[1:09:00] for the RAM taught us that the channels
[1:09:02] become clogged so now there was a
[1:09:05] perfect harmony of the invisible the
[1:09:09] spiritual supernatural and physical and
[1:09:11] this is what the Garden of Eden
[1:09:13] condition presented
[1:09:14] and a woman in perfect harmony together
[1:09:16] but I win man fell something is lost
[1:09:19] romance isn't from that time there was a
[1:09:22] time when death started that's when Eve
[1:09:25] struck lay down to the Garden of Eden
[1:09:27] met Satan and it's when she hurt first
[1:09:30] believed Satan's lied that death started
[1:09:32] and what happened she committed first
[1:09:35] spiritual adultery first she committed
[1:09:38] spiritual intercourse then the natural
[1:09:41] act took place I'm just using the
[1:09:43] language of the message it first
[1:09:45] happened unseen it first happened
[1:09:47] spiritually and then the physical act
[1:09:49] was place why that was the order that it
[1:09:51] followed and so then once this death
[1:09:57] starts and these great channels become
[1:10:00] clogged brother Bram says or the Bible
[1:10:02] says in Genesis 3:23 and 24 therefore
[1:10:05] the Lord God sent him forth from the
[1:10:07] Garden of Eden that brother man says
[1:10:10] they're still in Eden
[1:10:12] he says the garden was a place in Eden
[1:10:15] but they're driven from the Garden of
[1:10:17] Eden to till the ground from whence he
[1:10:20] was taken so he drove out the man and
[1:10:22] placed and he placed at the east of the
[1:10:25] Garden of Eden cherubims a flaming sword
[1:10:27] which turned every way to keep the way
[1:10:29] of the Tree of Life
[1:10:30] so the garden represents perfect harmony
[1:10:33] of the spiritual the supernatural and
[1:10:35] the physical and this garden a physical
[1:10:39] description it had geographical borders
[1:10:41] we could read about it in Genesis
[1:10:43] chapter 2 and it's a type of even this
[1:10:45] description that God gives in
[1:10:46] Revelations 21 and the physical location
[1:10:52] and the physical attributes they were
[1:10:53] not erased from the earth God describes
[1:10:57] it from the river Euphrates to this he
[1:10:59] describes a dislocation but he didn't
[1:11:02] erase this and it became a black hole
[1:11:04] but yet something was lost in that way
[1:11:06] God guarded they were still in Eden but
[1:11:10] what the garden represent had become
[1:11:12] lost something had changed that the holy
[1:11:16] image of God left them is what brother
[1:11:18] Branham said and what happens is the
[1:11:21] physical loses its connection to the
[1:11:23] invisible that harmony that it shared
[1:11:27] oneness that completeness where they
[1:11:28] could be in a physical location on earth
[1:11:30] and then all of a sudden there's a
[1:11:32] divide that comes in a separation that
[1:11:33] comes they are no longer in harmony with
[1:11:36] God their father and so after the fall
[1:11:41] mankind exists in a physical realm it's
[1:11:45] in a realm of only light time and matter
[1:11:47] the supernatural world the supernatural
[1:11:50] part of the garden was lost so in
[1:11:53] Genesis chapter 3 verse 15 this is what
[1:11:55] ends the beginning the judgment to the
[1:11:58] woman and the judgment to the the
[1:12:00] serpent he says I'll put enmity between
[1:12:02] thee and the woman and between thy seed
[1:12:04] and her seed and brother says this is
[1:12:08] the beginning but in the ending of the
[1:12:11] beginning God is speaking of a seed
[1:12:14] that's going to bring us back to the
[1:12:16] beginning because the seed of genesis
[1:12:18] 3:15 is a promise of a redeemer and it's
[1:12:22] going to be a redeemer of the physical
[1:12:24] and the spiritual it's going to be a
[1:12:26] redeemer that's going to bring back that
[1:12:28] which was lost so there's a healing
[1:12:30] prophecy in the judgment to the serpent
[1:12:33] in judging the serpent he hides a
[1:12:36] prophecy of Christ in judging the
[1:12:38] serpent he prophesized of a redeemer and
[1:12:43] he had to prophesy a seed to come he had
[1:12:47] to prophesy a redeemer because Adam and
[1:12:49] the woman never fulfilled the original
[1:12:51] purpose of the creation that promised to
[1:12:55] be fruitful multiply Nury pleasure I've
[1:12:57] never had a place to land genesis 3:15
[1:13:01] the seed of genesis 3:15 is the promise
[1:13:04] of Genesis 1:28 be fruitful multiply and
[1:13:06] replenish the earth and one day that
[1:13:08] caught you to the womb of a virgin and
[1:13:10] what does it brings back it brings back
[1:13:12] the potential of Genesis 1:28 because
[1:13:15] now you have the seed of Genesis 1:20
[1:13:17] the seed of genesis 3:15 brother branham
[1:13:24] says a power of transformation he said
[1:13:27] there was Adam and Eve walking in the
[1:13:28] Garden of Eden every seed bringing forth
[1:13:31] it never could do nothing else it can
[1:13:33] never do nothing else God because God
[1:13:35] said let it be that way it had to be
[1:13:37] that way oh how I'd like to stop here
[1:13:39] just
[1:13:39] minute to say there is where we are
[1:13:41] facing the completion of that word what
[1:13:47] is the profit point us - we are facing
[1:13:49] the completion of Genesis 1:28 every
[1:13:52] seed bringing forth of its kind because
[1:13:54] when Adam and the woman brought forth
[1:13:56] sons they did not do it in fulfillment
[1:13:58] of Genesis 1:28 they did not do it
[1:14:01] according to the word so he says now
[1:14:05] what are we facing we're facing the
[1:14:07] completion of that word the completion
[1:14:10] of God's original purpose brother man
[1:14:12] ray wrote now Jesus our last Adam and
[1:14:15] his eat the true church will fulfill all
[1:14:18] the plan of God by and through the
[1:14:22] members of his bride will be fulfilled
[1:14:23] all that God intended all that God
[1:14:26] wanted to fulfill in the Virgin so if
[1:14:32] God's going to bring back the original
[1:14:34] he had to bring back the he had to start
[1:14:38] from the invisible and what if her God
[1:14:42] to start to bring back the original he
[1:14:46] had to start with what was there in
[1:14:48] order to redeem creation so now we'd be
[1:14:50] in Reverse I'm just hitting the
[1:14:53] highlights here there's hitting the high
[1:14:55] spots it would be in Reverse now he must
[1:14:59] deal with man outwardly in order to
[1:15:01] bring Redemption he couldn't start from
[1:15:04] the invisible because that would be
[1:15:05] starting all over he had to start from
[1:15:07] the outward so what he begins with he
[1:15:10] begins by calling a man Abram and for
[1:15:14] nothing but just election God says Abram
[1:15:17] get myself out of that country and from
[1:15:19] thy kindred into a land that I will show
[1:15:21] thee and it was a physical land he said
[1:15:23] I will make of thee a great nation and I
[1:15:26] seed and they were all families of the
[1:15:28] earth be blessed so he had to start
[1:15:30] calling a man Abram and calling her away
[1:15:34] from a physical family and bring him to
[1:15:36] a physical land but Abram was looking
[1:15:38] who is the father of our faith he was
[1:15:40] looking for a city which has foundations
[1:15:42] whose builder and maker was God not some
[1:15:46] place temporary not some place
[1:15:47] transitioner but he was looking for
[1:15:49] revelations 21
[1:15:51] something permanent something eternal as
[1:15:54] the father of our faith he looked at
[1:15:56] those things which are not and called
[1:15:58] them as though they were even though
[1:16:00] they weren't physical before him he
[1:16:01] called them as though they were but God
[1:16:04] speaks has ever passed through the land
[1:16:07] into a place of sashimi under the plain
[1:16:09] of Mora and again and the Canaan I was
[1:16:11] then in the land and he finally
[1:16:12] constantly being Abraham through a
[1:16:14] natural land why God had to start with
[1:16:18] the physical he had to start with Abram
[1:16:20] in the flesh he had to call him
[1:16:22] outwardly because God now is going to
[1:16:24] work in Reverse and I'm just going to go
[1:16:27] very very quickly and skip quite a bit
[1:16:30] now because when God when you get to
[1:16:34] Genesis chapter 12 Genesis chapter 1 to
[1:16:37] Genesis chapter 11 is God just setting
[1:16:39] the scene and setting the stage because
[1:16:41] now once he gets to Genesis chapter 12
[1:16:43] the rest of the Old Testament is a story
[1:16:45] about one man and his family and where
[1:16:48] they live
[1:16:49] it's about Abraham his seed and the land
[1:16:52] that God promised him but God's purpose
[1:16:55] in that was not just to have a man with
[1:16:58] sons who have a land but to bring forth
[1:17:00] genesis 3:15 from that place so it's all
[1:17:05] about one man with the promise who had
[1:17:07] sons and inherit earth but God is
[1:17:09] wanting to manifest and show that he
[1:17:11] wants to redeem what had been lost is
[1:17:16] for God to have a wife he has to become
[1:17:19] a husband he had to first become a
[1:17:23] bridegroom he had to first become a head
[1:17:26] he had to become a savior of his wife
[1:17:27] which is his body so the Old Testament
[1:17:31] is us understanding God's election of
[1:17:33] grace in Abram and bringing to this
[1:17:35] place where he will frighten that seed
[1:17:37] the seed of Abraham was Christ his pulse
[1:17:42] said he didn't say seeds as of many but
[1:17:43] as to one which is Christ so in Christ
[1:17:47] the seeds of Abraham would be blessed so
[1:17:49] what he was looking through the whole
[1:17:51] time was God saith it is going to be by
[1:17:53] election one day the seed will come and
[1:17:56] he will redeem the natural seed of
[1:17:58] Abraham
[1:17:59] but that will not be the climax of
[1:18:01] redemption because the royal seat will
[1:18:03] be and lasts even so now we're gonna
[1:18:08] skip we're gonna skip the that part of
[1:18:10] the Old Testament we go from Genesis 12
[1:18:12] now to the New Testament where the
[1:18:14] invisible God achieves is perfect
[1:18:16] expression in the bridegroom and what is
[1:18:19] he he's a physical Messiah - a natural
[1:18:22] seed I think of this because now when
[1:18:25] God called Abram he called him after the
[1:18:26] flesh he's called a it's bi-election but
[1:18:29] he calls him he tells him to leave his
[1:18:31] own family to separate from self from a
[1:18:32] land and now the physical the scene the
[1:18:39] natural what was visible was manifesting
[1:18:41] the spiritual here's a man who looked at
[1:18:45] me about 50 years old but what was he
[1:18:46] doing when you've seen me you've seen
[1:18:47] the father
[1:18:48] he's manifesting the unseen no man has
[1:18:51] seen God at any time but his only
[1:18:53] begotten son he hath declared him so the
[1:18:57] supernaturals being declared the
[1:18:58] Invisibles being made known he's proving
[1:19:00] that everything Adam lost in the fall
[1:19:02] was being restored order was being
[1:19:05] restored he could create he could
[1:19:07] control nature he can multiply creation
[1:19:09] the holy image of God that was fast in
[1:19:12] the beginning was now in harmony with
[1:19:14] the flesh it was showing that redemption
[1:19:19] was manifesting itself in a man born of
[1:19:21] a woman but it's something different
[1:19:25] because the first Adam was a living soul
[1:19:28] but now the second Adam is a quickening
[1:19:30] spirit
[1:19:31] the first man was earthly sensual but
[1:19:34] the second man was the lord of heaven
[1:19:38] what does that mean it's greater why did
[1:19:43] God bring the woman out of the man where
[1:19:45] the brassicas that God had created again
[1:19:46] it would have been greater than the
[1:19:47] original so when he brought forth the
[1:19:50] woman she was co-equal because she was
[1:19:52] not created she was from the original
[1:19:54] creation so now we have the beginning of
[1:19:57] the creation of God now it is a new race
[1:20:00] a super race now it is the son had been
[1:20:03] promised in the beginning
[1:20:04] so now God has created again what is its
[1:20:08] greater it's the mystery of God but when
[1:20:16] this physical Messiah came to the
[1:20:20] natural seed they didn't receive him or
[1:20:23] even recognize him John 1:11 says he
[1:20:26] came into his own and his own received
[1:20:28] him not how is it is his own it's
[1:20:30] because it was the natural scene that
[1:20:33] could be identified by a physical
[1:20:35] lineage that could be identified by
[1:20:38] physical inheritance why why did he say
[1:20:40] coming to his own because it was in the
[1:20:42] physical land where he was to come it
[1:20:44] was in the promised land it was in
[1:20:45] Palestine it was it was in that place
[1:20:48] the land of the Israelites it was to the
[1:20:50] seed that came from Abraham the God of
[1:20:53] Abraham Isaac and Jacob he came to that
[1:20:55] natural seed in that natural land as it
[1:20:58] was promised to be done but they
[1:21:04] couldn't they couldn't recognize him
[1:21:05] well they were too focused on the
[1:21:07] natural - focused on the physical -
[1:21:11] focused on what could be seen they saw
[1:21:13] the flesh and that kind of that kind of
[1:21:15] messed him up a little bit because they
[1:21:17] thought if there's gonna be a redeemer
[1:21:19] if there's gonna be a messiah he's gonna
[1:21:20] be taller Saul was if there's going to
[1:21:23] be a messiah is going to be an earthly
[1:21:24] deliver a great king a very charismatic
[1:21:26] man they also heard rumors about how he
[1:21:29] had come to be and they were so focused
[1:21:31] on a natural kingdom that they were not
[1:21:33] they were not catching the existence of
[1:21:36] a spiritual revelation and the
[1:21:37] expression of a spiritual revelation why
[1:21:42] because they were physical people when
[1:21:45] God called Abraham what did he give him
[1:21:47] a physical sign of circumcision what did
[1:21:49] he give a promise to a physical lineage
[1:21:51] through Isaac through Jacob Israel he
[1:21:54] became known as the God of Abraham Isaac
[1:21:55] and Jacob these are all natural people
[1:21:57] he gave him a physical land called
[1:21:59] Canaan it had physical boundaries that
[1:22:02] were clearly distinct in mark when they
[1:22:03] went into bondage it was a physical
[1:22:05] bondage in a natural and when it came
[1:22:07] time to be delivered he gave him a
[1:22:09] physical deliverer to take them as out
[1:22:11] of a physical land then he brought them
[1:22:12] to a physical mountain he gave you
[1:22:14] physical tablets he gave me physical law
[1:22:16] he gave him a physical temple he gave
[1:22:18] him a physical sacrifice everything with
[1:22:22] Israel was physical physical physical
[1:22:24] physical for the Jews everything was
[1:22:27] always natural my land goes to this
[1:22:31] River it goes to this sea the God of
[1:22:33] Abraham Isaac and Jacob it was natural
[1:22:36] how can you prove yourself to be in
[1:22:38] Israel they had a natural circumcision
[1:22:40] didn't Paul say for the Jews require a
[1:22:43] sign
[1:22:44] it had to be outward so now think
[1:22:49] spiritually so when Jesus comes into his
[1:22:52] own when he speaks to them he says why
[1:22:55] are you so fearful o ye of little faith
[1:22:58] Matthew 826 mark 4:40 how is it that you
[1:23:03] have no faith so when he's speaking to
[1:23:06] the own that he came to he says you have
[1:23:08] little faith they had some faith but he
[1:23:10] called it little faith and honors he
[1:23:12] says you have no faith then in Matthew
[1:23:14] 16:18 says when Jesus perceived he's
[1:23:16] sending them oh ye a little bit glum
[1:23:19] yourselves so he's identifying a faith
[1:23:23] but it was a little faith
[1:23:25] I imagine the rebuke it must have been
[1:23:27] to say you know what if you just had
[1:23:29] faith the grain of a mustard seed that
[1:23:33] was a rebuke to them I hold on to that
[1:23:38] we don't have to give this room up at
[1:23:40] any particular time doing you can tell
[1:23:42] them I'm a diamond member so now he had
[1:23:55] come into his own in a visit as a
[1:23:56] physical Messiah to a physical people
[1:23:59] from a physical place Bethlehem came to
[1:24:02] a physical places that he was prophesied
[1:24:03] how to Nazareth all these different
[1:24:05] places he's man walking the shores of
[1:24:07] Galilee great light has sprung up and
[1:24:09] he's identifying self doing natural
[1:24:10] things and physical things and they
[1:24:12] handle him and touch them but yet they
[1:24:15] received him not
[1:24:18] so now in his physical coming which his
[1:24:21] first coming was to redeem his bride he
[1:24:25] begins to speak of another promise he
[1:24:27] said the father would send a comforter
[1:24:29] so now what he's talking about is a
[1:24:31] spiritual baptism because his first
[1:24:35] coming is going to climax on the day of
[1:24:38] Pentecost and the very capstone of the
[1:24:42] minister Jesus Christ was 120 people in
[1:24:44] an upper room the capstone of the
[1:24:47] ministry of the Messiah's first coming
[1:24:49] was only 120 people because his ministry
[1:24:52] John the Baptist the Prophet the
[1:24:55] forerunner introduced the Messiah to the
[1:24:58] church it introduced the church to the
[1:25:01] Messiah and then the Messiah took the
[1:25:03] church all the way to their capstone to
[1:25:06] their positioning on the day of
[1:25:07] Pentecost because he's after his death
[1:25:11] burial and resurrection he appeared
[1:25:13] physically several times after the
[1:25:15] resurrection to build their confidence
[1:25:17] in where God wanted them to be there in
[1:25:20] Jerusalem to point them to the promised
[1:25:25] why because the climax of his first
[1:25:27] coming was going to be meeting in the
[1:25:29] upper room to receive a spiritual
[1:25:32] baptism and that would be this that
[1:25:35] would be the capstone to the Jewish
[1:25:36] Church Ages that would be the position
[1:25:38] of placing to the Jewish Church so
[1:25:45] listen what he says in mark 16 14
[1:25:48] afterward he appeared into the eleven as
[1:25:50] they sat at meat and abraded them with
[1:25:53] their unbelief and hardness of heart
[1:25:54] because they believed not them which had
[1:25:57] seen him after he was risen so he keeps
[1:26:01] appearing to him so they would have
[1:26:03] confidence to go to Jerusalem and tarry
[1:26:04] there until the time of the promised
[1:26:07] king now once the promised comes we
[1:26:10] don't believe in carrying meetings
[1:26:12] because once the promise came it was
[1:26:15] unto them and his men as the Lord God
[1:26:17] would call and from then on every age is
[1:26:19] the age of the Holy Ghost of the true
[1:26:21] believer so now in the promises
[1:26:30] fulfilled the Holy Ghost comes but it's
[1:26:34] not physical it's not a physical son of
[1:26:38] God but it's the spiritual son of God
[1:26:41] the Son of God the baptism only ghosts
[1:26:43] the comforter now come invisibly into
[1:26:46] his church and so now the original seed
[1:26:51] of genesis 3:15 the seed of Genesis 1:28
[1:26:54] the original seed had brought God's
[1:26:56] program back to the invisible working to
[1:26:59] the visible because now God could start
[1:27:04] work from the inside out God can work
[1:27:07] from unseen to seen from the invisible
[1:27:09] to the visible and now the invisible is
[1:27:13] in harmony to with the physical again
[1:27:15] and now they're not looking to a
[1:27:17] physical temple they're not look into
[1:27:19] physical sacrifices not looking to
[1:27:21] physical ordinances they're looking to
[1:27:23] the unseen and now the church which is
[1:27:28] his body the body of Jesus Christ would
[1:27:30] be built upon not a natural foundation
[1:27:31] but upon the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:27:34] which is faith it's a place you don't go
[1:27:38] to with your feet and put your foot on
[1:27:40] one corner and walk to another place and
[1:27:42] put it on another corner but it's
[1:27:44] something invisible by revelation you
[1:27:46] stake your claim on it faith would be
[1:27:50] the foundation of his church Saints
[1:27:52] would be the access to the invisible it
[1:27:55] would be unseen before it's seen because
[1:27:58] faith would be the substance of things
[1:28:00] hoped for the evidence of things not
[1:28:02] seen
[1:28:02] it would first be supernatural
[1:28:04] revelation it would first be an unseen
[1:28:07] conviction faith is the substance of
[1:28:09] things hoped for pulse didn't you see it
[1:28:12] why would you hope for it but faith is
[1:28:14] the substance of it it already exists
[1:28:17] before the natural eye sees it because
[1:28:19] faith is the evidence of things not seen
[1:28:23] [Music]
[1:28:26] so just as Adam was in the garden and as
[1:28:30] Jesus was in Galilee
[1:28:31] now the invisible God was in harmony
[1:28:33] spiritual harmony with the natural his
[1:28:35] church his natural people so now I'm
[1:28:39] just telling the story tonight consider
[1:28:42] the pattern now of the unfolding of the
[1:28:45] visible in the New Testament Brian think
[1:28:49] of the promise for today reverence is
[1:28:51] when the church can get in such harmony
[1:28:53] with God until the
[1:28:55] manifestation the bridegroom is
[1:28:57] manifested in the bride you know why the
[1:29:00] people rejected him in his first coming
[1:29:03] because they missed the physical
[1:29:05] manifestation and didn't understand the
[1:29:07] process it was how he appeared and the
[1:29:10] purpose for what he which he appeared
[1:29:12] but yet here's Johnson behold the lamb
[1:29:15] of God which takes away the sin of the
[1:29:17] world nobody else saw that but the
[1:29:19] Prophet you this was a lamb his purpose
[1:29:23] was to be a sacrifice so they miss the
[1:29:28] fleshly expression and they missed the
[1:29:30] purpose and they do it again today the
[1:29:33] very manifestation of his body and the
[1:29:35] very purpose that she has in Christ
[1:29:41] revealed in his own word he said there's
[1:29:42] nothing else left for it to come but him
[1:29:44] himself just step into that because
[1:29:46] that's the last thing there is the next
[1:29:49] is the intelligence he says it's God
[1:29:51] himself it's becoming to a place he's
[1:29:55] governed the body all the way through
[1:29:57] then the complete body of Christ is
[1:30:00] revealed in the form of a bride that was
[1:30:03] taken out of his side like Adams was at
[1:30:05] the beginning so now he wants to bring
[1:30:09] the last expression of himself you want
[1:30:11] to know who the final expression of God
[1:30:13] is it's his bride Christ is the mystery
[1:30:15] God revealed the bride is the mystery of
[1:30:18] God finished the complete body of Christ
[1:30:25] is revealed in the form of the bride he
[1:30:27] says just like it was in the beginning
[1:30:29] why because it's to come back to that he
[1:30:37] says it's governed all the way down
[1:30:38] through what was he he was ace the son
[1:30:41] of God did the church changes the
[1:30:43] baptism of the holy ghost in the
[1:30:45] Millennium he comes as the son of David
[1:30:46] but between the son of God and the son
[1:30:49] of David he comes again as the son of
[1:30:50] man the complete body of Christ is
[1:30:54] revealed in the form of a bride so if
[1:30:59] you look at Luke chapter 17 because he
[1:31:02] gets prophecy as it was in the day the
[1:31:05] lot in the days of Noah so shall it be
[1:31:06] in the day when the Son of Man is
[1:31:08] how in Jesus is giving this it says in
[1:31:12] verse 18 Burks does virtually some and
[1:31:14] where being evil where the body is there
[1:31:16] will the eagle's be gathered together
[1:31:18] there were the fresh-killed the word is
[1:31:20] there was the body word that son of man
[1:31:23] is there will the bride be gathered
[1:31:24] together
[1:31:25] you're not feasting on a man you're not
[1:31:27] peace on the words of a man the words of
[1:31:29] a man will fail but you're feasting on
[1:31:31] the unfailing body word of the son of
[1:31:33] man so he brings us to Luke 17 37 but it
[1:31:37] continues he doesn't he didn't stop
[1:31:40] there he says and he spake a parable
[1:31:43] unto them this is so now he's continuing
[1:31:46] to amplify the revelation of the Son of
[1:31:49] Man and the gamin of the Eagles for the
[1:31:51] body word of the son of man and he tells
[1:31:53] a story about an unjust judge about us
[1:31:57] in a city where there was a judge
[1:31:59] why because one day there's going to be
[1:32:01] a city on earth that the judge comes to
[1:32:03] but it will not be and I just judge
[1:32:06] it'll be the wigged one the supreme
[1:32:08] authority and this woman where is the
[1:32:14] judge finally says oh my goodness let me
[1:32:16] avenge you of your adversary and he says
[1:32:18] this is an unjust judge he said wouldn't
[1:32:21] that God avenge his own elect which cry
[1:32:23] day and night and and even so come Lord
[1:32:26] Jesus would he not a venture speedily he
[1:32:30] says behold I come quickly
[1:32:32] yes he avenges her speedily he says I
[1:32:41] tell you he will but notice the key it
[1:32:45] will avenge them speed but when the Son
[1:32:48] of man cometh shall we find faith on the
[1:32:52] earth when he reveals himself to the
[1:32:55] Gentiles will he find faith when he came
[1:32:58] physically to the Jews no faithful
[1:33:01] little faith but when he comes as a son
[1:33:03] of man to the Gentile bride will he find
[1:33:06] faith that's what he's looking for
[1:33:09] Oh could we not just say you gon be
[1:33:14] blessed thank you Lord for letting us
[1:33:16] see this blessed revelation in the
[1:33:18] entire what
[1:33:19] you just give him praise for a second
[1:33:21] why don't you just offer some
[1:33:22] Thanksgiving
[1:33:25] they had aloo yeah thank you Jesus
[1:33:29] Oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:33:33] they're seeing this heavenly light in
[1:33:36] this in time Oh Darrin
[1:33:43] now listen think of this during his
[1:33:45] physical coming and I'm trying to bring
[1:33:50] this to a close and you all aren't
[1:33:51] helping and it's physical coming there
[1:33:58] was a sign that was given that was
[1:34:01] foreshadowing this Brides failure
[1:34:03] because he says when the Son of man
[1:34:05] cometh though revealing of the son of
[1:34:07] man is the coming of the son of man when
[1:34:09] the son of man cometh is he gonna find
[1:34:12] faith because that's what he's looking
[1:34:13] for because the Union requires faith
[1:34:16] faith in love work together
[1:34:19] félicité this union to work there's got
[1:34:21] to be faith so when he comes as a
[1:34:23] bridegroom
[1:34:23] listen if he reveals himself as a
[1:34:25] bridegroom it reveals his characteristic
[1:34:27] bridegroom means a man about to be
[1:34:29] married when he revealed himself as
[1:34:32] bridegroom in this out there made there
[1:34:33] had to be a bride come forth to fulfill
[1:34:36] his purpose listen I say this in the
[1:34:39] name of the Lord
[1:34:40] we cannot be bribed unless our
[1:34:42] bridegroom is here when he when he comes
[1:34:54] in his physical coming I I keep saying
[1:34:57] physical coming but listen that was a
[1:34:59] word coming
[1:35:00] don't let him don't let anybody tell you
[1:35:02] that wasn't a word coming that was the
[1:35:05] word coming because it was the word that
[1:35:07] came to John the Baptist now why did the
[1:35:10] word come to John the Baptist because
[1:35:12] work to the Prophet why did Jesus come
[1:35:15] to the jour that River that day because
[1:35:17] that's where the Prophet was the word
[1:35:19] had to come to the Prophet and that was
[1:35:21] a word coming
[1:35:22] [Music]
[1:35:27] and in that word coming which manifested
[1:35:30] in a physical Messiah to a physical
[1:35:31] people in a physical land there was a
[1:35:34] representation of the bride's faith
[1:35:36] there was a foreshadow just a little
[1:35:39] glimpse then a preview of how the
[1:35:42] Gentiles would receive him at his coming
[1:35:45] in mark chapter five in Luke chapter 8
[1:35:48] and yatris is the ruler of the song
[1:35:50] here's a Jew he says I pray thee common
[1:35:54] lay hands on my daughter so this is a
[1:35:57] Jew with the physical Messiah showing
[1:35:59] you the Jews faith he wants the the
[1:36:01] deliverer the Messiah to come and lay
[1:36:04] physical hands on my daughter
[1:36:06] then the woman with the blood issue she
[1:36:09] touches the hem of His garment
[1:36:11] she makes physical contact with him he
[1:36:14] says that they have made the whole
[1:36:18] listen that was a faith that was a
[1:36:22] little faith but there was a greater
[1:36:24] faith there was a greater faith being
[1:36:29] expressed because listen when brother
[1:36:33] Branham preached peace of the trumpets
[1:36:34] it recognized your day in its message
[1:36:36] he's preaching all about the Jews
[1:36:38] because there was a promise to the Jews
[1:36:40] but at the same time a promise to the
[1:36:42] Gentile so he's preaching recognizing
[1:36:44] your day in its message and he's reading
[1:36:46] Hosea and he's saying to the Jews to the
[1:36:47] Jews but there's a mystery to us to
[1:36:49] recognize your day and tour message the
[1:36:52] piece of the trumpets is what brings us
[1:36:53] to the full revelation that now we're
[1:36:55] living in something different because
[1:37:00] now he's starting to point to the fact
[1:37:01] that the very next coming is going to be
[1:37:03] to reveal himself to the Jews so in his
[1:37:09] first coming there's all likewise this
[1:37:11] manifestation that's taking place as
[1:37:13] he's revealing himself to Israel there's
[1:37:15] a there's a foreshadowing of the bride's
[1:37:17] faith I'm not gonna ask for permission
[1:37:20] I'm just gonna take my liberty let's
[1:37:21] turn to Matthew chapter 5 verses 22 to
[1:37:25] 28 it says I'm behold a woman of Canaan
[1:37:32] in mark chapter 7 it says the woman was
[1:37:34] a Greek of Sara Phoenician by nation so
[1:37:36] she's not a Jew
[1:37:38] she can't he says he behold a woman of
[1:37:41] Canaan came out of the same coasts and
[1:37:43] crown him saying have mercy on me o thou
[1:37:45] son of David
[1:37:47] odorous he wants she wants to call him
[1:37:50] son of David so he had to begin to think
[1:37:52] of the type my daughter's grievously
[1:37:54] vexed with the devil but he answered her
[1:37:56] not a word and he says and his disciples
[1:37:59] came and besought him saying send her
[1:38:01] away for she crieth unto us but he
[1:38:03] answered and said I am not of this of
[1:38:05] this I am NOT sent but unto the lost
[1:38:07] sheep of the house of Israel now why did
[1:38:13] he hide this mystery because we knew
[1:38:16] that he wasn't that he was he was sent
[1:38:18] he was going to be it through him the
[1:38:21] whole world would be redeemed but now he
[1:38:24] she called him son of David
[1:38:26] so she's crying unto Him he says I'm not
[1:38:29] sent but unto the lost sheep of the
[1:38:31] house of Israel and it almost seems
[1:38:33] misleading but he's hiding a mystery
[1:38:37] then she came and worshiped him saying
[1:38:39] who said truth Lord as the son of David
[1:38:45] he was sent to the lost sheep of the
[1:38:47] house of Israel but now she says true
[1:38:49] Lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs
[1:38:52] which fall from their master's table
[1:38:54] then jesus answered and said unto her o
[1:38:56] woman great is that faith he never said
[1:39:02] that to a Jew but now to acerra
[1:39:04] Phoenician to a woman of Canaan all
[1:39:06] woman great as I faith it under thee
[1:39:09] even as thou wilt and her daughter was
[1:39:11] made whole from that very hour he says
[1:39:16] I'm not sent but to the lost sheep of
[1:39:18] the house of Israel hiding the mystery
[1:39:20] that he was sent to the Gentiles
[1:39:23] seemingly hiding that mystery but she
[1:39:26] says the right thing just that I may not
[1:39:29] be a lost sheep of Israel that's true
[1:39:31] Lord but even the dogs eat crumbs that
[1:39:33] fall from their master's table I'm at
[1:39:36] that saying
[1:39:37] that's great faith and without him going
[1:39:40] to lay hands on his daughter she was
[1:39:42] made whole that very so on the woman of
[1:39:47] Canaan was expressing not a faith or a
[1:39:50] little faith but a great faith and in
[1:39:55] March after eight verses 5 to 13 when
[1:39:58] Jesus was entered into Capernaum there
[1:40:01] came unto him a Centurion this is a
[1:40:02] Roman now this is a Gentile beseeching
[1:40:06] him say Lord my servant life to home
[1:40:08] sick of palsy grievously tormented and
[1:40:10] Jesus sent him I will come and heal him
[1:40:13] this is exactly what the ruler of the
[1:40:16] synagogue wanted come lay your hands on
[1:40:18] him get the physical touch lay your body
[1:40:21] upon the body this is how these things
[1:40:23] were done it was always physical but now
[1:40:25] notice something within the Centurion
[1:40:27] says Lord I'm not worth it the vows
[1:40:30] should come under my roof and I say they
[1:40:32] did but Speak the word only and my
[1:40:34] servant shall be healed
[1:40:37] here's the Gentile with the revelation
[1:40:39] the spoken word is enough you do not
[1:40:46] need to travel distance you don't need
[1:40:49] to come physically to my servants you do
[1:40:51] not need to commonly hand the word is
[1:40:54] enough but Speak the word only listen in
[1:41:03] this hour but the organization's are
[1:41:05] indicted for the second crucifixion from
[1:41:08] then on comes the word and the word only
[1:41:14] speak the word only and my servant shall
[1:41:17] be healed
[1:41:17] for I'm a man under Authority having
[1:41:20] soldiers under me and I say to this man
[1:41:23] go and he goeth and to another company
[1:41:25] cometh and to my servant do this and he
[1:41:27] doeth it
[1:41:28] when Jesus heard it he marveled
[1:41:32] [Applause]
[1:41:33] [Music]
[1:41:35] listen Tina father a Jew he didn't
[1:41:40] marvel at gyro he didn't marvel at Peter
[1:41:42] he didn't more about a Jew but now this
[1:41:45] Gentile because this was marvelous this
[1:41:57] was a marvelous faith that would come
[1:41:59] from marvelous grace hallelujah he
[1:42:04] marveled and he said unto them to follow
[1:42:07] verily I say unto you I have not found
[1:42:10] so great faith no not in Israel I found
[1:42:15] faith I found a little faith but I
[1:42:17] haven't found a great faith in Israel
[1:42:19] because I came to my own and my own
[1:42:21] received me not I now here's a heathen a
[1:42:25] reprobate a Gentile a Roman who says
[1:42:30] word only is enough and I sandy that
[1:42:35] many shall come from the east and the
[1:42:37] west and shall sit down now he's
[1:42:39] starting to reveal the mystery of the
[1:42:40] Gentile bride shall sit down with
[1:42:42] Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the
[1:42:44] kingdom of heaven he's revealing a
[1:42:46] mystery he hid it when he talked to the
[1:42:48] woman from Sarah Phoenicia but now he's
[1:42:50] saying hey there's going to come a day
[1:42:51] when Gentiles are going to come to this
[1:42:52] light and they're going to be heirs with
[1:42:54] Abraham Isaac and Jacob and he says but
[1:42:56] the children of the kingdom shall be
[1:42:58] cast out into outer darkness which
[1:43:00] Kingdom the natural Kingdom and there
[1:43:02] shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth
[1:43:03] and Jesus saying to this interior gold
[1:43:06] my way as thou hast believed so be it
[1:43:09] unto thee and a servant was healed in
[1:43:11] the self-same hour this is the Gentile
[1:43:17] faith this is the faith that brother
[1:43:19] Branham said we ought to run at a higher
[1:43:21] level he said he was the Gentile way is
[1:43:24] to believe him just absolutely believe
[1:43:26] him this is what's being revealed it's
[1:43:31] I'm gonna have to cut the story short
[1:43:33] but listen he came to them and began to
[1:43:36] reveal himself and there's a Gentiles
[1:43:39] there that recognized them this is the
[1:43:41] chin toffee this is the bride's faith
[1:43:44] thy word nothing physical no distance
[1:43:48] travel just faith the mystery of
[1:43:53] Christ's body the Gentile bride not even
[1:43:55] been revealed yet the Gentiles are not
[1:43:59] even considered heirs but the word
[1:44:03] excited of faith in the Gentiles the
[1:44:08] faith that Jesus marveled after he says
[1:44:11] I have not seen a great faith not in
[1:44:14] Israel
[1:44:15] what was he foreshadowing a bride what
[1:44:18] was this sign of that when the Son of
[1:44:20] man cometh he'll find faith you'll find
[1:44:23] a great faith the Jewish dispensation
[1:44:32] beginning the natural calling of Abram
[1:44:35] and ended with the physical must and
[1:44:38] then once the physical Messiah came
[1:44:41] there were spiritual blindness why
[1:44:43] because he came to call them out of a
[1:44:45] physical promised land into a spiritual
[1:44:47] promised land when Moses came he
[1:44:49] delivered them out the natural bondage
[1:44:51] physical bondage to a natural end but
[1:44:54] now in this Exodus when the Messiah
[1:44:56] comes the LORD thy God shall raise up a
[1:44:57] prophet liken unto me it's not a
[1:44:59] physical Exodus but it's an exodus out
[1:45:01] of a spiritual condition into a
[1:45:04] spiritual Promised Land but then when
[1:45:11] the Gentile dispensation began they
[1:45:14] begin with the Holy Spirit baptizing
[1:45:15] people in the spiritual body
[1:45:17] now those Gentiles did not receive a
[1:45:21] physical Messiah they received the
[1:45:23] spiritual Messiah the son of God
[1:45:25] the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[1:45:28] Gentile church was introduced to Christ
[1:45:31] by a prophet who knew Jesus Christ by
[1:45:33] revelation who brought them to a
[1:45:36] spiritual Mount Zion who talked about
[1:45:38] tablets of their heart it wasn't a
[1:45:40] physical mount it was a spiritual
[1:45:42] Mountain it wasn't physical tablets it
[1:45:44] was spiritual tablets the Gentile bride
[1:45:49] with no natural connection no natural
[1:45:52] land nothing physical no natural hair
[1:45:54] natural tradition no physical history
[1:45:56] nothing will receive
[1:45:58] Jesus Christ based upon the word and the
[1:46:00] word only received Christ at the word of
[1:46:05] preachers
[1:46:05] I mean Theo peon has a has Philip come
[1:46:09] and preaches to him and he receives it
[1:46:11] have the word of Philip he didn't have
[1:46:13] to see the Messiah doing miracles and
[1:46:15] signs and wonders without sight without
[1:46:17] tradition by faith what was happening
[1:46:22] the Gentiles were coming to the light
[1:46:24] the light that was in the Jewish Church
[1:46:28] the harmony of the supernatural with the
[1:46:31] physical and so jesus said in Luke
[1:46:35] chapter 10 verse 23 and he turned his
[1:46:37] disciples and said privately blessed are
[1:46:39] the eyes which see the thing you see the
[1:46:45] Jews were blessed to seek God unveiled
[1:46:48] before them in his son and remember you
[1:46:52] can only know the God for the son
[1:46:54] so to know God you have to know the son
[1:46:57] so you have to know the sons
[1:46:58] manifestation which manifestation of the
[1:47:01] son is it's the same God it's the same
[1:47:03] son but you can only known for the
[1:47:05] manifestation of a son the Jews received
[1:47:09] a physical Messiah blessed are the eyes
[1:47:11] which see the things that you see and
[1:47:14] you know the Jews will still receive him
[1:47:17] the physical Messiah because he comes
[1:47:20] again the corporal coming to Lord to
[1:47:22] 144,000 what would they see where did
[1:47:24] you get those scars because that's his
[1:47:26] promise to the Jews but then in John 20
[1:47:29] 29 jesus said to them Thomas because
[1:47:31] thou has seen me thou hast believed why
[1:47:34] he's a Jew blessed are they that have
[1:47:37] not seen and yet have believed
[1:47:41] so let me just end with this son the
[1:47:44] Gentile bride receives a spiritually
[1:47:46] revealed Messiah Robert I said it's the
[1:47:50] very it's the very word that becomes
[1:47:52] alive and carries us to her unseat
[1:47:53] Bradley he says it works just Express
[1:47:57] and the invisible unit of the church
[1:47:59] bride the Christ
[1:48:01] that messenger is here now which is
[1:48:03] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:48:05] and forever listen why is it happening
[1:48:09] this way because
[1:48:11] we're not Jews that's the problem that
[1:48:15] happens today with people who think
[1:48:17] their spiritual Jews they tie it to the
[1:48:19] color of their skin they tied to a
[1:48:21] natural line they tied to tied to
[1:48:22] natural Kingdom listen I think God
[1:48:25] didn't ambush am i because I was born in
[1:48:28] Arizona but I'm an heir I'm a spiritual
[1:48:32] error
[1:48:33] well because I'm royal see not because
[1:48:37] the color of my skin but my spiritual
[1:48:39] revelation and then well you know the
[1:48:47] church the Bride of Christ that
[1:48:48] messengers here now
[1:48:50] it's a spiritual Messiah for spiritual
[1:48:53] union that takes us through to a
[1:48:56] physical rapture and a physical meeting
[1:48:59] in the air but that's how God works is
[1:49:03] the unfolding on the invisible it has to
[1:49:06] be spiritual first before it can be
[1:49:08] physical before we can meet him in the
[1:49:11] air we have to met him here and this is
[1:49:16] the great faith to believe that you have
[1:49:19] received the spiritual Messiah and are
[1:49:21] uniting with him now
[1:49:22] this is a marvelous faith says improving
[1:49:28] his word we know that there's a messiah
[1:49:29] coming and when that Messiah comes he's
[1:49:32] going to be the word there was the
[1:49:38] invisible son of God the Holy Ghost
[1:49:40] through seven Church ages building a
[1:49:42] bride in seven ages but then at the end
[1:49:45] of the seventh page that's going to be a
[1:49:47] spiritual revelation of the Son of Man
[1:49:50] that the bride will receive romance as
[1:49:56] an identification of Christ in all ages
[1:49:58] Jesus Christ the Son of God is here with
[1:50:01] us now
[1:50:02] be identified resurrect pieces making
[1:50:05] himself known first time he's done this
[1:50:08] since nineteen hundred years ago and he
[1:50:10] is here tonight
[1:50:13] Wow we got something different
[1:50:17] just as he came unto his own and his own
[1:50:20] received him not
[1:50:20] now he's came into his own body piece of
[1:50:25] the trumpets now now how she appeared in
[1:50:28] the last days is to bring the people
[1:50:30] back to the world so that the bride will
[1:50:34] know her husband know her mate the
[1:50:36] revealed word
[1:50:39] it's exactly what God's pattern he works
[1:50:42] from the invisible for the spiritual to
[1:50:44] the physical it's a three-fold purpose
[1:50:46] of God manifested in Adam and Eve the
[1:50:48] invisible God Express they prefigure in
[1:50:51] them now Christ and the bride will
[1:50:54] manifest the perfect fulfillment now the
[1:50:57] invisible God is expressed in the
[1:50:59] bride's body now we can say our light
[1:51:03] has come share Shalom it's darkness upon
[1:51:06] the earth gross darkness upon the people
[1:51:08] but the glory of the lord has risen upon
[1:51:11] thee
[1:51:13] now it's bride light now and the bride
[1:51:20] coming of Christ what is this
[1:51:23] spiritually revealed first and a
[1:51:26] spiritual union and then what's going to
[1:51:29] happen we're going to be changed we're
[1:51:35] gonna meet our Lord in the air because
[1:51:39] that's exactly what he did in the
[1:51:40] beginning God will bring us to the man
[1:51:46] like you did to the woman in the
[1:51:48] beginning but she was first United with
[1:51:51] him spiritually and God is uniting the
[1:51:55] bride now with the word it's the
[1:51:57] unfolding of the invisible I'm sorry to
[1:52:00] to not finish the story we'll leave that
[1:52:03] to your pastor you can do a better job
[1:52:05] anyways let's stand to our feet
[1:52:09] [Music]
[1:52:10] [Applause]
[1:52:19] [Music]
[1:52:28] the world is looking for nail scars
[1:52:30] they're looking for thorn prints they're
[1:52:34] even looking to a natural sky hoping to
[1:52:38] see a 900 foot Jesus but he says when he
[1:52:41] says look up your Redemption draws nigh
[1:52:44] he didn't mean take your natural gaze
[1:52:46] and look to the sky he's talking on
[1:52:49] attitude why did the Prophet preach look
[1:52:54] away to Jesus because he was trying to
[1:52:58] get us to look away from something and
[1:52:59] see something else
[1:53:01] why did he preach there is a man here
[1:53:04] who can turn on the light why because he
[1:53:06] was our brother that was standing next
[1:53:08] to the engineer he said don't worry
[1:53:10] little bride there is a man here who can
[1:53:14] turn on the light enraptured that church
[1:53:20] that's why he said watch the third pool
[1:53:24] that's why I said look on this because
[1:53:29] he was pointing us to something he's
[1:53:32] wanting us to see our mate a bridegroom
[1:53:35] and just as John introduced the church
[1:53:38] to the Messiah and the first coming our
[1:53:41] messenger has introduced the bride to
[1:53:43] her bridegroom and just as Christ took
[1:53:47] the church from there all the way to the
[1:53:49] Opera room Christ will take the bride
[1:53:51] all the way to a meeting in the air it's
[1:53:56] the invisible union let us bow our heads
[1:54:00] let us pray to the Lord our Heavenly
[1:54:02] Father Lord we thank you for your great
[1:54:05] grace Lord we thank you that you have

[1:54:23] stand before these people huh and Lord I
[1:54:25] count myself to be privileged tonight to
[1:54:28] express these great words that have been
