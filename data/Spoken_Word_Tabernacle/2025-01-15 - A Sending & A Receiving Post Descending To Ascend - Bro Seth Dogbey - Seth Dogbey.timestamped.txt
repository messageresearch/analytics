[48:05] 7 to 11

[48:13] 55:7 it said let the wicked forsake his
[48:17] way and let the unrighteous men his
[48:21] thoughts and let him return unto the
[48:25] Lord and He will have have mercy upon
[48:28] him and to our God for he will
[48:31] abundantly pardon amen can be seated
[48:34] tonight
[48:36] amen
[48:38] amen he will abundantly pardon amen I we
[48:42] continue with the reading amen he said
[48:45] for my thoughts are not your thoughts
[48:49] that's neither are your ways my ways
[48:53] sayth the Lord for as the heavens are
[48:57] higher than the earth so are my ways
[49:00] higher than your ways and my thoughts
[49:03] than your thoughts for as the rain
[49:06] cometh th down and the snow from heaven
[49:10] and return it not thether amen but WTH
[49:14] the Earth and maketh it bring forth
[49:18] andb that it may give seed to the so and
[49:23] bread to the eater amen so shall my word
[49:27] be that goeth forth out of my mouth it
[49:30] shall not return and and that's where we
[49:33] are getting tonight it shall not return
[49:36] unto me void but it shall accomplish
[49:40] that which I please and it shall prosper
[49:45] in the thing where to I sent it amen may
[49:49] the Lord add his Blessing to the reading
[49:51] of the word amen and and I want us to
[49:54] look at it tonight it said it shall not
[49:57] return that's right so the word is there
[50:00] is a return When the Lord is saying
[50:04] something it is coming back to
[50:07] him amen and he saying that it is not
[50:10] coming back to him empty it is not void
[50:13] he shall accomplish whatever he
[50:18] pleases
[50:20] amen so
[50:24] my my title for tonight amen amen yes
[50:27] sir is as sending and a receiving post
[50:31] amen descending to
[50:35] ascend
[50:38] amen the prophet said something that he
[50:42] said the way up is
[50:46] down now the emphasis is not the down
[50:51] but the emphasis is up cuz he's giv us
[50:54] the way up amen so when you are going
[50:57] down know that there is an up the reason
[51:01] why you were going down is because you
[51:03] have to go
[51:05] up amen so many times we look at the
[51:09] downside the downside and our minds get
[51:12] off the
[51:14] upside the reason why God is saying you
[51:17] are going down is because he wants to
[51:20] take you up the reason why the Lord
[51:24] descended is that we should that
[51:27] sent amen the Lord didn't descend to
[51:30] come and look at us in in in in in that
[51:33] low State low state of sin but he came
[51:37] down so we can be like him amen
[51:43] amen so I want to take this um quote
[51:47] again as I did the last
[51:49] time amen
[51:58] sry all
[52:00] right all
[52:02] right I'll just I'll just do it that we
[52:06] amen amen thank you Pastor
[52:09] amen so it said um from the message show
[52:13] us the father amen said and then when
[52:17] Jesus Christ spoke these
[52:19] words they never die that's right amen
[52:24] science claims in many years from now
[52:28] they can pick up the literal voice
[52:30] they'll be able to pick up the literal
[52:32] voice of Jesus and I believe there are
[52:36] vessels tonight amen that can pick up
[52:39] those literal voice of Jesus and I see
[52:42] them seated here tonight amen cuz these
[52:46] vessels are the receiving end of what
[52:51] God has sent amen amen it said there be
[52:56] able to pick up the leral voice of Jesus
[52:59] is still in the earth cuz see it's a
[53:02] sending
[53:04] post so the prophet said you
[53:07] are so it is not just God that is
[53:10] sending God has also called us as
[53:13] ambassadors to send Amen to speak again
[53:18] his word
[53:19] amen it said then there has to be a
[53:23] receiving
[53:24] post so what what want to look at
[53:27] tonight is that you are
[53:30] sending and also you are
[53:33] receiving so a sending post and a
[53:38] receiving post amen that is what we are
[53:41] speaking about tonight
[53:45] amen it said it's real to you and it
[53:48] will live just like it was then that's
[53:51] right amen now we take John 6
[53:57] 31
[54:02] amen so John chapter
[54:05] 6:31 just to prove something amen
[54:08] tonight amen John 6:31 to35
[54:13] amen he said our fathers did it manner
[54:15] in the desert amen as it is written amen
[54:19] he gave them bread from Heaven to eat
[54:22] then Jesus said unto them verily verily
[54:25] I say unto you Moses gave you not that
[54:28] bread from heaven but my father giveth
[54:31] you the true bread from heaven for the
[54:34] bread of God is he which cometh down
[54:37] from heaven and giveth life unto the
[54:40] world then said they unto him Lord everm
[54:44] more give us this bread and Jesus said
[54:47] unto them I am the bread of life he that
[54:52] cometh to me shall never hunger and he
[54:55] that believeth on me shall never
[55:00] test amen so we see here that Jesus is
[55:04] saying I am the bread of life am amen so
[55:09] he that cometh to
[55:12] Jesus get gets access to this
[55:15] bread amen so we who have come to Jesus
[55:19] we have gained access to this
[55:22] bread amen so now it's no longer Jesus
[55:26] Jus who is the owner of this bread but
[55:29] you and I also own this
[55:33] bread now we go to Ecclesiastes chap 11
[55:37] verse1 thank you Lord so remember we are
[55:40] owning the
[55:46] bread now Ecclesiastes 11 verse
[55:53] 1 it said cast your
[55:57] bread cast thy
[56:00] bread
[56:02] upon the waters for thou shallal find it
[56:07] after many days so Jesus Christ being
[56:11] the word that is given to us now we own
[56:15] that word and the word of God is saying
[56:17] let us cast that bread that's right and
[56:21] after many days that bread will come
[56:24] back to us exactly right
[56:26] so remember the word of God said that it
[56:29] shall not return to me
[56:31] void so this same bread that God has he
[56:35] give to you and I and he said cast it
[56:38] upon the waters and it will never return
[56:41] to you void am amen am it shall
[56:45] accomplish every purpose that he God
[56:49] pleases so when we please God whatever
[56:53] we speak shall be accomplished
[56:59] amen
[57:01] amen amen still in a testing mode amen
[57:06] amen so just as we know when when um
[57:10] Christ said except the corn of wheat
[57:13] amen falls to the ground it abideth
[57:15] alone
[57:16] amen God does not want to be
[57:20] alone amen so God is sending this same
[57:23] bread to you and I to do the the same
[57:26] thing that he
[57:28] does
[57:30] amen amen amen so now we uh we read this
[57:33] message uh going beyond the camp
[57:37] amen now the prophet uh before this
[57:40] paragraph amen I'm reading
[57:45] paragraph paragraph 74 amen amen but
[57:49] before then the prophet talked about the
[57:52] fact that um the word of God come to the
[57:54] prophets amen right
[57:56] and since the prophets become the word
[58:00] of God Amen the people try to normally
[58:04] do things their own way amen he said God
[58:08] gave them the word God gave them Prophet
[58:10] God gave them miracles signs and wonders
[58:12] referring to Moses amen but they wanted
[58:15] their own Camp they wanted to do their
[58:17] own thing so God asked Moses to separate
[58:21] himself amen so because of that the word
[58:24] of God becomes a stranger
[58:26] amen so the prophet becomes a stranger
[58:28] to these people and they try to put him
[58:30] out they try to kill him amen but braah
[58:34] is saying here that he said now we find
[58:36] out that he dwelt then among his prophet
[58:40] he then become a stranger to them amen
[58:43] for he dwells only in his word that's
[58:46] right to confirm it so when the word is
[58:49] being spoken God dwells without word to
[58:53] confirm it remember he's given the word
[58:56] to you now it is not just he alone
[58:59] speaking but he has also given us the
[59:01] word to speak and and the prophet is
[59:04] saying that God dwells in his word to
[59:07] confirm it amen so the Bible said that
[59:10] he watches over his word to confirm it
[59:14] so it is all about the movement of his
[59:16] word it is not the situation or it is
[59:20] not even the people amen but it is where
[59:23] the word is that is where God is
[59:26] amen amen am he said he is trying to
[59:30] find someone yes brother amen so he's
[59:34] watching over the word and trying to
[59:36] find someone when someone become the
[59:39] vessel to pick up this word amen that
[59:41] word will accomplish his purpose in that
[59:45] person
[59:46] amen he said um talking about Samson he
[59:50] said he was a half-hearted man amen he
[59:52] gave his strength to God Amen and gave
[59:54] his heart to the lilac say like it's
[59:56] like
[59:57] uh like um an insurance policy when you
[1:00:01] get an insurance policy you might as
[1:00:04] well get full coverage amen and that's
[1:00:08] what this Blessed Assurance does for us
[1:00:10] it's a full coverage policy amen so God
[1:00:14] dwells in full coverage so when God says
[1:00:18] I'm going to heal you I'm going to
[1:00:19] provide for you I'm going to protect you
[1:00:22] it's a full coverage amen he's not going
[1:00:24] to do just one and leave the other
[1:00:27] that's why I don't believe that when God
[1:00:29] heals me amen that's the end of it no
[1:00:33] when God heals me it means he's also
[1:00:35] going to bless me with other stuff amen
[1:00:38] amen when God heals me he's also going
[1:00:41] to protect me because God doesn't do
[1:00:44] things halfway amen he doesn't just do
[1:00:47] half and leave the other half amen when
[1:00:50] God blesses you amen he's going to
[1:00:52] continue to bless you until there's an
[1:00:55] over flowing
[1:00:58] amen amen he said it covers all we have
[1:01:02] need of here in this life and our
[1:01:06] resurrection and eternal life it
[1:01:09] includes
[1:01:11] everything it includes
[1:01:13] everything so the prophet said in the
[1:01:15] same message he said you know a sheep a
[1:01:18] sheep don't have to have but one thing
[1:01:21] to offer and that's wo amen and now he's
[1:01:25] not asked to to produce or to
[1:01:28] manufacture so what you are speaking
[1:01:31] what we are sending out we are not
[1:01:34] supposed to manufacture it amen amen it
[1:01:38] said he asked to Bear wool Amen to Bear
[1:01:43] it it is a part of you amen and because
[1:01:46] it was a part of you that was why it
[1:01:49] came out of you amen the word has to be
[1:01:52] a part of you to come out of you amen
[1:01:55] amen so we are not asked to manufacture
[1:01:57] something we are asked to Bear the fruit
[1:01:59] of the spirit amen so that that that's
[1:02:02] the inside of the ship that he is on the
[1:02:06] inside makes the wool on the outside
[1:02:10] amen amen we take this message
[1:02:13] desperations amen sir it said now the
[1:02:16] word plainly
[1:02:19] states if you want to put this down in
[1:02:21] Galatians 56 that faith worketh by love
[1:02:28] right amen
[1:02:31] amen now we um just want to say
[1:02:36] this when we send something out right
[1:02:40] there is a target that's it let's say I
[1:02:43] have a telephone call amen I don't just
[1:02:47] pick up the call and then speak into the
[1:02:49] air there is a target that I'm speaking
[1:02:53] to and before it gets to that Target
[1:02:57] there has to be an attraction there has
[1:03:00] to be something about that Target that
[1:03:02] will pick up the message that I'm
[1:03:04] sending across amen let's take um like a
[1:03:08] telephone when I take my telephone to
[1:03:11] make a phone call to brother khma amen
[1:03:14] my target is brother khma amen and if
[1:03:18] let's say maybe sister Co pick up the
[1:03:20] call amen that is not really my target
[1:03:24] amen so that is that that that it it is
[1:03:27] is not going to accomplish whatever I
[1:03:29] wanted to
[1:03:31] do it's just like you have all this uh
[1:03:34] phone calls coming to you now
[1:03:37] now amen so now now now technology have
[1:03:42] gotten to that stage where it is no more
[1:03:45] somebody talking to you but it is a
[1:03:48] robot amen that is looking that that
[1:03:51] that that is trying to trick you amen so
[1:03:56] artificial intelligence have gotten to
[1:03:58] that point amen that when you say hello
[1:04:01] then they know that it is you talking
[1:04:03] when you just keep quiet it is just
[1:04:05] going to hang up amen amen cuz why they
[1:04:09] have a Target they have something they
[1:04:11] trying to hit at that's right
[1:04:15] amen so before you get to that Target
[1:04:19] there is an attraction about that Target
[1:04:22] that picks up whatever is being sent
[1:04:25] amen amen amen so one of this
[1:04:29] attractions is What U we are trying to
[1:04:32] talk about right now yes
[1:04:35] sir Philippians 4:4
[1:04:39] amen read it the last time
[1:04:42] amen Philippians
[1:04:51] 4
[1:04:53] amen Philippians 4:4 he said rejoice in
[1:04:57] the lord always and again I say
[1:05:02] rejoice
[1:05:03] amen what does rejoicing do
[1:05:07] rejoicing believes that the thing is
[1:05:10] already
[1:05:11] done when I am rejoicing now when I get
[1:05:16] something right now when when let's say
[1:05:18] sister Kayla gives me a gift right now
[1:05:21] I'll be happy because I got a gift amen
[1:05:24] so anytime I rejoice it means I already
[1:05:27] have it so if even I don't have it and I
[1:05:31] am rejoicing it means that I already
[1:05:34] have it amen that is an attraction to
[1:05:38] the word that I already
[1:05:40] sent amen so that becomes the attraction
[1:05:44] to my receiving
[1:05:48] post I love this part of it it said
[1:05:51] rejoice in the
[1:05:53] Lord rejoice in the Lord
[1:05:56] Lord now uh looking at Ephesians 6 where
[1:06:00] it said U train up your
[1:06:02] child in in the Lord amen and and when
[1:06:07] you go to uh verse four it's talking
[1:06:09] about the fathers to
[1:06:12] nurture amen and to kind of admonish
[1:06:16] them in the word of the Lord I'm trying
[1:06:18] to paraphrase that so in actual fact the
[1:06:21] training of the child in the Lord or by
[1:06:24] the way of the Lord is leading the child
[1:06:28] by what the word of God has said so when
[1:06:31] I am rejoicing my rejoicing is in the
[1:06:36] word what exactly the word says is what
[1:06:39] I am rejoicing so he said always Rejoice
[1:06:43] so my rejoicing is what the word of God
[1:06:46] has said even in the bad time I'm
[1:06:49] rejoicing because the word of God has
[1:06:51] said this amen the promises of the Lord
[1:06:54] do not change even in the bad times
[1:06:59] amen
[1:07:01] amen let's let's just say
[1:07:04] that this is Brother set
[1:07:08] amen um we know brother
[1:07:13] Set uh maybe Bret lives uh in U
[1:07:16] Charlotte
[1:07:18] amen so when you see brother set in
[1:07:21] Charlotte
[1:07:23] amen that is brother set amen
[1:07:26] when you see brother set in
[1:07:28] henville that is brother
[1:07:30] set amen when you see brother set in
[1:07:33] Gastonia that that doesn't change
[1:07:36] brother said I just changed the
[1:07:39] environment amen so when I'm going
[1:07:42] through a trial it doesn't change me
[1:07:45] amen amen because I still remain the
[1:07:49] same it's just the condition the
[1:07:51] environment has just been changed amen
[1:07:54] that is why I keep
[1:07:56] rejoicing because the it was just the
[1:07:59] environment that changed but I never
[1:08:02] changed amen nothing is going to change
[1:08:06] me
[1:08:08] amen amen amen amen amen we're still
[1:08:15] testing this out
[1:08:16] amen amen is the same brother said amen
[1:08:21] is the same brother said
[1:08:23] amen and even if this thing gives any
[1:08:26] problem is the same brother said
[1:08:28] preaching tonight
[1:08:29] amen
[1:08:31] amen
[1:08:33] [Applause]
[1:08:35] amen yes sir yes sir amen amen glory to
[1:08:43] God yes sir so we are back here amen
[1:08:50] amen so Hebrews chapter um 13 verse 15
[1:08:55] said we should continually offer
[1:08:58] sacrifice of
[1:09:00] praise so it's a continuous process
[1:09:03] right praising the Lord for what he has
[1:09:05] done amen we are not praising the Lord
[1:09:08] because we saw it done but he said
[1:09:11] continually continually means there's no
[1:09:13] end to it amen so it said rejoice in the
[1:09:16] lord always it is a continuous process
[1:09:19] so I'm praising the Lord even if I'm in
[1:09:22] a a hard time amen because I am not
[1:09:25] changing amen cuz the word of God is
[1:09:28] with me amen wherever I am going that's
[1:09:31] where the word is going cuz he's
[1:09:33] watching over his
[1:09:36] word amen so we are talking about
[1:09:39] attractions
[1:09:40] amen I said now the prophet said now the
[1:09:43] word plainly states if you want to put
[1:09:46] this down in Galatians 5:6 that Faith
[1:09:48] worketh by love now when I'm am
[1:09:52] rejoicing is an expression of faith
[1:09:56] because I am speaking something that the
[1:09:59] Lord has done for me even if I didn't
[1:10:01] see it amen and he said you can the
[1:10:05] prophet said you Faith worketh by love
[1:10:07] that's right it is when I have it is
[1:10:10] when I love
[1:10:11] something that that is where you see me
[1:10:14] talking about the
[1:10:16] thing when I really love something when
[1:10:19] I really want to have a mention amen
[1:10:22] I'll will keep speaking about that
[1:10:24] mention
[1:10:27] when I want to get married to a lovely
[1:10:30] husband or a sweet wife I am going to
[1:10:34] keep speaking that because that is what
[1:10:38] I love
[1:10:41] amen it's it's just like some people who
[1:10:45] who don't um like roaches or spiders
[1:10:48] amen when they even hear the word
[1:10:51] roaches they don't even want you to say
[1:10:53] it because there's no for it but when
[1:10:57] somebody loves steak or somebody loves
[1:10:59] chicken or somebody loves shmp amen at
[1:11:02] the sound of shrimp amen the person want
[1:11:05] you to keep talking about
[1:11:07] shrimp amen cuz cuz there's the love for
[1:11:12] it so Faith worketh by love it says see
[1:11:16] Faith work by love and the only way that
[1:11:18] you can have faith is have love first
[1:11:22] amen because after all faith is Love's
[1:11:24] incentive
[1:11:26] amen
[1:11:28] amen now from this message the sudden
[1:11:31] secret growing away of the
[1:11:33] church now we are talking about
[1:11:37] love or faith working with love as a
[1:11:41] form of attraction to whatever we spoke
[1:11:45] amen the prophet said in this message
[1:11:47] said I think now of what Paul said when
[1:11:50] he said there's a crown of righteousness
[1:11:52] laid out for me that the Lord the
[1:11:54] righteous judge will give me at that day
[1:11:58] and then he stopped said did you notice
[1:12:01] and said not only me but to all them
[1:12:05] that love his
[1:12:07] appearing if we love his
[1:12:10] appearing amen So when you say something
[1:12:14] or when you speak something if you
[1:12:16] really love that thing to
[1:12:20] appear amen it is going to appear to you
[1:12:25] amen it said them that love his
[1:12:28] appearing so the Rapture is for those
[1:12:32] who love the appearing of the Lord it is
[1:12:36] not for those who are frightened when we
[1:12:38] talk about
[1:12:39] Rapture it is not for them amen amen it
[1:12:43] is for them who love the appearing of
[1:12:46] the Lord the prophet say usually in the
[1:12:48] word today that people think of the
[1:12:50] appearing of the Lord as a horrible
[1:12:52] Dreadful thing
[1:12:55] right said oh that word might come to it
[1:12:59] he said don't talk to me about that that
[1:13:01] they will
[1:13:04] say I I I was talking to my
[1:13:06] brother-in-law one
[1:13:08] time uh talking to him about the end
[1:13:10] time amen and he said is it the end of
[1:13:13] the
[1:13:15] end just just uh by the mere fact that
[1:13:18] you talk about Rapture amen it just
[1:13:22] scares them to to to that core that he
[1:13:25] said is it the end of the End Amen we
[1:13:29] are the end time amen whe whether it's
[1:13:32] the beginning of the end or the end of
[1:13:34] the end it is the end
[1:13:36] time amen amen he said they don't care
[1:13:40] about them just for the present day
[1:13:42] living but those who love the Lord love
[1:13:45] his appearing amen so when when I love
[1:13:52] healing amen I am going to love it to
[1:13:56] appear you know people people talk about
[1:14:00] um their conditions of depression and
[1:14:03] all those stuff and I am this I am that
[1:14:08] and I'm struggling like this and this
[1:14:10] and that and every time they talking

[1:14:18] can ask my wife I just can stand that
[1:14:20] amen amen amen
[1:14:25] oh my so you see the the more they talk
[1:14:28] about those things the more they love it
[1:14:32] cuz you see you talk about things you
[1:14:35] love right amen so if this is my
[1:14:39] sickness this my sickness this my
[1:14:41] sickness it it's because you love that
[1:14:44] sickness that's why you keep talking
[1:14:46] about it amen amen instead of saying
[1:14:49] this my sickness say this my healing
[1:14:52] amen amen so you see the sickness and
[1:14:54] said this my healing amen you see all
[1:14:57] those troubles you say this my blessing
[1:15:00] amen amen amen cuz when we talk about
[1:15:03] those things that is the attraction that
[1:15:06] brings the Fulfillment to our
[1:15:08] lives amen
[1:15:12] amen so you know um I I didn't want to
[1:15:15] go into this but I'm just just trying to

[1:15:47] that God has not done anything for her
[1:15:50] and she's she's been miserable and she's
[1:15:53] doing all those stuff and then my wife
[1:15:55] will say you know what sit down let's
[1:15:58] talk let me tell you what God has
[1:16:02] done so she will begin to count them you

[1:16:16] same God that took me out of this took
[1:16:18] me out of that took me out of this he's
[1:16:21] going to take me out and today we see
[1:16:23] the manifestation of that amen amen yes
[1:16:28] sir so something that we love is what we
[1:16:31] talk
[1:16:32] about
[1:16:35] amen
[1:16:38] amen so the same the same message he
[1:16:41] said this secret coming of the Lord
[1:16:44] sudden secret going of the church amen
[1:16:47] watch though between the field it'll
[1:16:50] take one and leave one there'll be two
[1:16:53] in the bed you know those days just we
[1:16:55] thank God for the message amen it's just
[1:16:58] plainly day and night amen there is day
[1:17:01] here there is night somewhere else as
[1:17:04] simple as that amen amen I said the
[1:17:08] other one in the bed sleeping on the
[1:17:10] other side of the world Amen I'm just
[1:17:12] trying to skip I said it will be a
[1:17:15] universal Rapture I said and it will
[1:17:17] come with the Shout with the voice of
[1:17:21] the Archangel and the Trump of God shall
[1:17:24] sound
[1:17:25] [Applause]
[1:17:27] and amen there is an and there and the
[1:17:32] dead in Christ shall rise and she will
[1:17:35] be CAU away secretly that's right
[1:17:39] amen so what what what I I was just um
[1:17:45] trying to bring out here is that the
[1:17:48] Lord descended with a
[1:17:52] shout with a voice and with a trump
[1:17:56] what was the main reason behind God
[1:18:02] descending
[1:18:04] amen God didn't descend just to come and
[1:18:07] show himself so we can look at him and
[1:18:10] say oh this is Beautiful Jesus oh you
[1:18:13] know no there is an A and D to it amen
[1:18:19] so when God condescended Amen he's
[1:18:22] trying to pick you up to get to his
[1:18:26] position

[1:18:31] trumpet bringing God down means that you
[1:18:35] and I are also going
[1:18:39] up that is why he said we can't
[1:18:41] manufacture that we just bear it it is a
[1:18:46] part of us because it has descended for
[1:18:50] us to ascend it said and the dead in
[1:18:54] Christ shall rise
[1:18:55] and she be cut away secretly said oh I
[1:18:57] love that the great bridegroom coming
[1:19:00] and the bride God herself

[1:19:24] we are working this out amen it is not
[1:19:28] us going to do anything it is he who has
[1:19:31] descended and there's an and D to read
[1:19:35] amen now I I I just looked at something
[1:19:39] in Psalm 47 amen if we can go to Psalm
[1:19:43] Psalm
[1:19:46] 47 Psalm
[1:19:53] 47 some
[1:19:55] 47:5
[1:19:57] amen yes sir now he
[1:20:00] said God is gone up yes sir with a
[1:20:04] shout the Lord with the sound of a
[1:20:07] trumpet that's right now here is not
[1:20:10] talking about coming down he's talking
[1:20:12] about going up so wherever there's a
[1:20:15] shout there is a trumpet there is a
[1:20:18] voice and we see a coming down there's
[1:20:21] also a growing up so he said God
[1:20:25] so it is not you that is going up it is
[1:20:29] God that is going up that's why I say ye
[1:20:32] are God Amen it is us that is going up
[1:20:36] amen so the shout the trumpet The Voice
[1:20:40] have already sounded and we are going up
[1:20:43] we are not going to do anything about it
[1:20:46] amen
[1:20:47] amen
[1:20:49] amen amen and amen amen amen
[1:20:54] yes sir amen it's ready
[1:20:59] amen

[1:21:27] amen and amen amen
[1:21:30] amen yes
[1:21:32] sir amen
[1:21:42] amen
[1:21:45] amen so
[1:21:47] um so we go to the next slide it said
[1:21:51] um uh I I hope I'm I'm time man yeah
[1:21:56] said this a personal experience with God
[1:21:58] he said we left off the real principle
[1:22:02] the real thing that God told us to
[1:22:04] receive was let the Holy Spirit lead the
[1:22:07] church that's it that's it
[1:22:10] amen so it is the holy spirit that is
[1:22:13] doing this thing it is the holy spirit
[1:22:16] that is leading the church when the word
[1:22:18] of God is sent forth the brother brah
[1:22:22] said that God is watching in over his
[1:22:25] word amen so it is the holy spirit that
[1:22:28] is leading the church I said we've left
[1:22:31] that off we've lost our divine
[1:22:37] Joy it said we said the vision is D now
[1:22:42] we've lost the Divine joy and when you
[1:22:45] look at rejoicing it talks about great
[1:22:49] joy amen so but brah is saying that
[1:22:54] because we left our divine Joy the
[1:22:58] vision is
[1:23:00] D people are now not looking at the
[1:23:05] vision very bright the vision about what
[1:23:08] has been said the vision about you
[1:23:10] speaking the vision about you sending
[1:23:13] out the the word of God you lost that
[1:23:17] Divine Joy it is that Divine joy that is
[1:23:21] going to make you see that vision
[1:23:27] amen
[1:23:32] amen okay yes sir
[1:23:36] okay so as you said people are not
[1:23:38] looking at U for the coming of the Lord
[1:23:40] and yet atomic bombs hanging in and
[1:23:42] Hangers everywhere and things that will
[1:23:45] destroy the world at once amen we are
[1:23:47] seeing a lot of things going on right
[1:23:48] now a lot of fires amen but people has
[1:23:52] lost their vision of the Lord because
[1:23:54] they have set
[1:23:56] times we lost the vision of the word
[1:24:00] that we spoke because we set times to
[1:24:04] this we set time to the healing we set
[1:24:09] time to the prosperity we set time to
[1:24:12] God's leadership we set time to
[1:24:16] Deliverance because of that our vision
[1:24:20] is dark it is not bright because we have
[1:24:24] said it must happen at this time it must
[1:24:27] happen at that time we started the year
[1:24:30] and we have our own plans Lord this must
[1:24:34] happen this time Lord this must happen
[1:24:36] that time Lord I must get this job at
[1:24:39] this time Lord this business at that
[1:24:41] time
[1:24:42] amen and when it didn't happen that way
[1:24:46] it looks as if our eyes get very blurry
[1:24:50] amen we lost the vision because we have
[1:24:53] set time that's right
[1:24:56] amen amen I said they've done all these
[1:24:59] things trying to do it within
[1:25:02] themselves amen we are trying to do
[1:25:05] everything within ourselves because we
[1:25:07] spoke we we ourselves now are watching
[1:25:10] over the
[1:25:13] word because we spoke the word we have
[1:25:15] now become the people watching over the
[1:25:18] word but remember God gave us that bread
[1:25:22] that were to speak
[1:25:25] amen so it say he is the one watching
[1:25:27] over it so he sets the time for
[1:25:31] it amen he set the time for it it is not
[1:25:35] us amen amen so because of that our
[1:25:39] vision become so D
[1:25:42] amen
[1:25:44] amen now I I I just love this paragraph
[1:25:47] that is getting us into something said
[1:25:49] and now Moses talking about Moses he
[1:25:52] said Moses had been bit failure but out
[1:25:57] there now we see his attention attracted
[1:25:59] to a burning bush amen we know about the
[1:26:02] story of Moses the men and he looks to
[1:26:05] the burning bush to find out what the
[1:26:07] trouble was and walking close to it
[1:26:12] amen fire B said fire usually brings an
[1:26:19] attraction we talking about an
[1:26:21] attraction amen one of the attractions
[1:26:24] is
[1:26:25] fire fire usually brings an
[1:26:28] attraction now you see the whole world
[1:26:30] is looking at one state
[1:26:34] amen the state is on fire and all
[1:26:37] attention is going there amen amen I'm
[1:26:41] just reading what the prophet said amen
[1:26:44] usually the holy spirit
[1:26:46] amen amen I think I lost if I can read
[1:26:50] from here amen it said usually
[1:26:55] usually the Holy Spirit when he comes in
[1:26:57] a manner of fire attracts the attention
[1:27:00] of people and when Moses turned aside to
[1:27:03] consider this Burning Tree that will not
[1:27:06] burn God spoke to him a fresh Vision By
[1:27:10] An Angel so we are talking about fire of
[1:27:12] Attraction amen I said that's what it
[1:27:14] needs today is a church on fire to
[1:27:19] [Music]
[1:27:21] attract amen
[1:27:24] a church on fire to
[1:27:28] attract
[1:27:31] amen fire
[1:27:34] attracts a church must be on fire to
[1:27:39] attract on fire of the manifestation of
[1:27:42] the gifts on fire of of of the
[1:27:45] manifestation of the blessings on fire
[1:27:48] of the manifestation of the word amen
[1:27:51] The Church Must Be On Fire to attract
[1:27:55] yes sir Amen to attract some of these
[1:27:58] Moses around here somewhere said to
[1:28:01] attract some of these
[1:28:03] Sinners amen it takes fire to give an
[1:28:09] attraction amen yes sir so BR said you
[1:28:13] let a scream fire amen and everybody's
[1:28:16] going there amen yes sir everybody jump
[1:28:20] um in their car and try to follow it
[1:28:22] amen said there is something attractive
[1:28:25] about a fire what we need tonight is
[1:28:28] Holy Ghost and Fire that will attract
[1:28:31] the believer that Sy now now watch
[1:28:35] something first he said this sinners now
[1:28:39] he said believer amen so the Sinners get
[1:28:44] through the
[1:28:45] fire to clean something about
[1:28:48] them cuz they have always been
[1:28:51] Believers so when The Sinner gets
[1:28:54] attracted to the fire there's a
[1:28:56] cleansing Amen to show that he is a
[1:29:01] Believer amen now we are trying to get

[1:29:44] father of our Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:29:47] which according to His abundant Mercy
[1:29:50] have begotten us on again unto a lively
[1:29:54] Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:29:57] from the dead to an inheritance
[1:30:00] Incorruptible and
[1:30:02] undefiled and that faded not away
[1:30:06] reserved in heaven for you am who are
[1:30:09] kept by the power of God through faith

[1:30:26] for a season if need be ye are in
[1:30:29] heaveness through manifold
[1:30:32] Temptations so said he said for a season
[1:30:35] amen he said that the trial of your
[1:30:39] faith being much more precious than of
[1:30:42] gold th perisheth though it be tried
[1:30:46] with fire might be found unto praise and
[1:30:51] honor and Glory at the appearing of
[1:30:54] Jesus Christ amen so fire is a blessing
[1:30:59] to the
[1:31:01] believer
[1:31:02] amen so trials and temp Temptations is
[1:31:07] the fire that we go
[1:31:09] through God is cleaning us through this
[1:31:13] um trials and Temptation so when we get
[1:31:16] through this trials and Temptation amen
[1:31:19] we are moving from one channel to the
[1:31:22] other now remember we are talking about
[1:31:25] an attraction amen so this trial and
[1:31:28] Temptation amen is the fire of
[1:31:31] attraction to what to the word we
[1:31:36] spoke we speak a word we need to get it
[1:31:40] back but then there has to be trials and
[1:31:43] temptation to receive back the
[1:31:47] word amen Abraham yes sir amen
[1:31:54] so we want we want to um talk a little
[1:31:57] bit about um one story of fire in the
[1:32:01] Bible Daniel chapter 3 yes sir amen
[1:32:09] am Daniel chapter
[1:32:17] 3 I believe we all know the story
[1:32:21] amen amen the this um four special
[1:32:26] friends amen who are from the tribe of
[1:32:28] Judah
[1:32:29] amen and and they were also priests by
[1:32:33] Nature yeah yes sir the prophet called
[1:32:36] them the bride and then their Prophet
[1:32:39] amen we we're going to come to it amen
[1:32:42] so it's just it's just typing us amen
[1:32:47] it's just a perfect type of what is
[1:32:50] going on in this last age amen cuz you
[1:32:54] see
[1:32:56] that let's just read
[1:32:59] amen now nebukadnezar the king made an
[1:33:03] image of gold whose height was three
[1:33:06] cubits and the bread of thereof six
[1:33:09] cubits he set it up in the plain of dura
[1:33:13] in the province of Babylon amen the
[1:33:15] prophet said
[1:33:17] that this image was an image of a
[1:33:22] religious person
[1:33:24] a a righteous man amen and we know that
[1:33:27] man being Daniel Amen now Nebuchadnezzar
[1:33:31] has seen the manifestation of God in a
[1:33:34] man to the point where he just did an
[1:33:38] image of that man and then brought it to
[1:33:42] his
[1:33:44] friends that's right
[1:33:47] amen now you remember the prophet said
[1:33:51] that Daniel himself did not worship this
[1:33:54] image amen so if Daniel didn't worship
[1:33:58] the image what do you expect his friends
[1:34:01] to do his friends will never worship
[1:34:06] that
[1:34:07] image regardless of whether it was the
[1:34:10] image of Daniel or
[1:34:13] not amen so when you bring something
[1:34:18] amen of the Prophet amen and bring it to
[1:34:21] the bride today in the form of worship
[1:34:25] there is no way the bride of Christ will
[1:34:28] ever take
[1:34:30] that there is no way the bride of Christ
[1:34:34] will ever take that amen and when you
[1:34:37] notice it's a mixture of religion and
[1:34:41] idol
[1:34:42] worship amen so he's seen a
[1:34:46] manifestation of God in a man amen and
[1:34:50] we know 2,000 years ago there was
[1:34:52] manifestation of God in in a man amen
[1:34:55] and that was taken amen and mixed with
[1:34:59] idol worship and presented to the world
[1:35:03] yes sir amen yes now I'm going to read
[1:35:07] this
[1:35:10] um from verse
[1:35:14] 12en now uh as we
[1:35:16] know these three um Hebrew boys amen did
[1:35:22] not bow to the image
[1:35:25] amen so now there's a report that is
[1:35:28] been given to King Nebuchadnezzar he
[1:35:31] said there are certain Jews whom thou
[1:35:34] has set over the Affairs of the province
[1:35:36] of Babylon Shadrach mesach and
[1:35:40] abido these men oh King have not
[1:35:43] regarded thee they serve not thy Gods
[1:35:47] nor worship the golden image which thou
[1:35:51] Hast set up now when you look at it it
[1:35:54] said they serve not thy Gods nor worship
[1:35:58] the golden
[1:35:59] image so the golden image was connected
[1:36:02] to the gods of
[1:36:05] Nebuchadnezzar regardless of how
[1:36:07] righteous that golden image might look
[1:36:10] like it was still connected to the gods
[1:36:13] of
[1:36:14] Nebuchadnezzar and there's no way the
[1:36:17] bride in that day will ever take that
[1:36:20] amen because this people Bible says they
[1:36:24] they were they were children of
[1:36:27] wisdom yes sir God had given this people
[1:36:30] wisdom to to discernment to look at
[1:36:34] whatever spirit is going on regardless
[1:36:37] of how it is being
[1:36:40] presented amen amen yes sir I said then
[1:36:45] Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury
[1:36:48] commanded to bring Shadrach mesach and
[1:36:51] Abednego then they brought this men
[1:36:53] before the King Nebuchadnezzar spake and
[1:36:57] said unto them is it true shadra Mish
[1:37:00] anded do not ye serve my gods nor
[1:37:04] worship the golden image which I have
[1:37:06] set
[1:37:07] up amen a combo said now if ye be ready
[1:37:11] that at what time you hear the sound of
[1:37:15] the Cornet flute H sock but sulter and
[1:37:19] doer and all kinds of music
[1:37:22] amen amen you see the devil also perver
[1:37:27] the devil always perver how God does his
[1:37:30] worship amen before God comes to speak
[1:37:34] before there's worship amen there's the
[1:37:36] music there's the Levites who come and
[1:37:38] prepare the ground amen so the devil
[1:37:42] also takes that and perverts that yes
[1:37:45] sir amen yes sir
[1:37:49] amen goad amen amen so now if you be
[1:37:53] ready that at what time that's 15 you
[1:37:56] hear the sound of the Cornet flute HCK
[1:37:59] bed suy and dma and all kinds of music
[1:38:02] You Fall Down and Worship the image
[1:38:04] which I have made well but if you
[1:38:07] worship
[1:38:08] not ye shall be cast the same hour into
[1:38:12] the midst of a burning firey furnace and
[1:38:14] who is that God that shall deliver you
[1:38:18] out of my
[1:38:20] hand yes sir now now if you remember
[1:38:25] Nebuchadnezzar has seen a manifestation
[1:38:27] of deity in a
[1:38:29] man because his um his astrologers and
[1:38:34] his magicians told him that there's
[1:38:36] nobody right there's no man that can
[1:38:39] interpret your dream can know what dream
[1:38:42] you had or interpret except the gods
[1:38:45] amen so when you see a man coming to do
[1:38:48] that there's nobody who could do that
[1:38:50] but God himself so the book ATA saw that
[1:38:54] and idolized
[1:38:56] it but you see but now he's
[1:39:00] challenging amen now we we we get to
[1:39:03] find out that this is this is like an
[1:39:08] indirect connection to the god of Daniel
[1:39:11] not a direct visitation to
[1:39:14] Nebuchadnezzar
[1:39:16] amen it was Daniel that came to manifest
[1:39:20] God but he nebukadnezar didn't see it
[1:39:24] but when he came to the time of shedrach
[1:39:26] mesach and Abednego he saw the Son of
[1:39:29] God
[1:39:33] himself so it's a personal revelation
[1:39:37] that we must have of Christ in our end
[1:39:43] time yes sir
[1:39:45] amen
[1:39:47] amen amen sir it's a personal revelation
[1:39:51] so said who is that
[1:39:54] it say shedrach mesach and Abed answered
[1:39:57] and said to the king oh Nebuchadnezzar
[1:40:00] we are not careful to answer thee in
[1:40:02] this matter we are not
[1:40:06] careful in other words we are not
[1:40:09] cautious we can just speak to you the
[1:40:12] the the prophet said they were Stern
[1:40:15] they knew what they were talking about
[1:40:17] it wasn't a Wishy Wasing something they
[1:40:20] knew what they were talking about they
[1:40:23] didn't fear they knew what grounds they
[1:40:26] were
[1:40:28] standing
[1:40:30] amen it said if if it be so 17 Our God
[1:40:36] now this is what I want us to look at if
[1:40:39] it be so our God whom we serve is
[1:40:45] able to Deliver Us From The Burning
[1:40:50] fiery
[1:40:51] furnace now they've already
[1:40:55] spoke that he is
[1:40:59] able so the word has already been
[1:41:02] [Applause]
[1:41:05] sent
[1:41:07] amen yes sir the word has already been
[1:41:10] sent
[1:41:11] amen and
[1:41:13] then here he said and if he will deliver
[1:41:18] us and he will sorry and he will Deliver
[1:41:22] Us of out of thy
[1:41:25] hand when he's
[1:41:27] able so he's not just able we are not
[1:41:30] just saying God is able God is able but
[1:41:33] God will God shall do
[1:41:37] it yes sir he they are not just saying
[1:41:41] that um I know a powerful God who can do
[1:41:45] this but he's saying he will do
[1:41:49] it yes sir there is a certainty that
[1:41:52] he's going to do it so when the word of
[1:41:55] God come out of our mouth and it is
[1:41:58] based on the word that God has spoken he
[1:42:02] will do it not that he can do it and
[1:42:06] then we live it there but he's going to
[1:42:08] accomplish
[1:42:10] it yes
[1:42:13] sir so now I love this so they sent a
[1:42:17] positive word that he will do it
[1:42:21] yes now
[1:42:23] said but if
[1:42:26] not so now I just love the word
[1:42:31] if because if is a condition that's
[1:42:35] right so they were so positive to the
[1:42:38] extent that even the negativity was put
[1:42:41] under a
[1:42:43] [Applause]
[1:42:44] condition they were so
[1:42:47] positive that even a negative thought
[1:42:50] was put under condition now condition
[1:42:53] means that it might happen it might not
[1:42:55] happen so the negativity might happen
[1:42:58] might not happen so the negativity of a
[1:43:01] negativity is positive so I am still
[1:43:04] giving your negativity a positive
[1:43:11] chance yes
[1:43:13] sir
[1:43:15] amen
[1:43:16] amen yes sir some of us can be so
[1:43:20] negative that even our positivity is
[1:43:25] negativity we put up positivity and
[1:43:29] condition because we are so
[1:43:34] negative
[1:43:38] amen I
[1:43:41] I Pastor I I want to talk about
[1:43:44] something amen if you can permit me
[1:43:48] amen amen now I I wanted to read this
[1:43:52] quote about signs so we clear the U the
[1:43:56] airwaves amen so um now let's skip
[1:44:02] this so we as the prophet said I didn't
[1:44:04] want to go through all this stuff amen
[1:44:07] amen so let's go to the next slide amen
[1:44:10] let's go to the next
[1:44:13] slide
[1:44:16] okay amen now bra brah said something
[1:44:21] now Christian friends I want to say this
[1:44:24] just before amen many times many
[1:44:29] phenomenal things happen as brother
[1:44:32] backers explained to you I'm just your
[1:44:35] brother and just a man but when things
[1:44:39] are taking place let everyone hold their
[1:44:44] peace Hallelujah I don't know what will
[1:44:47] take place I want everyone to be just as
[1:44:50] Reverend as you can if you are a
[1:44:54] Critic I wouldn't
[1:44:56] [Music]
[1:45:01] said this is Brother Braham saying
[1:45:05] this he said if you're a Critic I
[1:45:08] wouldn't set near because remember
[1:45:11] friend he still call you a
[1:45:13] friend if this be said if you want to
[1:45:16] place it that way said the spirit of God
[1:45:19] and unclean Spirit go out of people
[1:45:23] so when brother Braham is U doing the
[1:45:25] miraculous things amen praying for the
[1:45:28] sick and things he said you are a Critic
[1:45:30] remember this I said the spirit of God
[1:45:33] goes out of people and you are a Critic
[1:45:36] you are subject to
[1:45:38] it amen and be it assured to
[1:45:44] you that I'm not responsible for
[1:45:47] criticism for any
[1:45:50] unbelief for a demon is just as helpless
[1:45:54] as he can be so brother Braham is saying
[1:45:58] that when the demons go out of people he
[1:46:01] prays for people and the demons get out
[1:46:03] of them they are
[1:46:06] helpless they are just looking for a
[1:46:08] place to go to so when you are a
[1:46:13] Critic they are coming to
[1:46:19] you so when God is sending out his his
[1:46:23] word and is delivering people from um
[1:46:27] from sicknesses is delivering people
[1:46:30] from bondage is delivering people from
[1:46:33] financial trouble and you are a critic
[1:46:37] that financial trouble is coming to you
[1:46:44] hey so when the word of God
[1:46:47] comes be positive we shout Amen to it
[1:46:53] amen and we cast out that demon
[1:46:56] amen yes sir I want to read the next
[1:46:59] slide amen amen I said I've noticed this
[1:47:02] in my own little humble Min I read it
[1:47:04] the last time amen that there's many
[1:47:06] times that I'll say something and do not
[1:47:09] know why I said it and it don't look
[1:47:11] right but yet somebody will say
[1:47:13] something but I'll watch and that thing
[1:47:16] will come just as perfect around to that
[1:47:20] as it can amen it can come
[1:47:23] God will make it
[1:47:26] happen that is how positive the prophet
[1:47:29] want us to be that when we are talking
[1:47:33] Amen Let Us believe that God will make
[1:47:36] it happen God is a god of positivity am
[1:47:41] yes sir now I I just want to amen let's
[1:47:46] go to the next slide I wanted to clear
[1:47:47] up something amen all right and I said
[1:47:52] you build homes you can make scientific
[1:47:55] things and God is the creator of
[1:48:01] science amen I said how are you going to
[1:48:05] stop him there's a lot of scientific um
[1:48:09] inventions going on right now amen and
[1:48:12] we know yes the devil operates by um all
[1:48:15] these means and things but the thing is
[1:48:17] that who created all these phenomenons
[1:48:20] amen who created this universe who
[1:48:23] created the word the prophet is saying
[1:48:25] God is the creator of signs amen am I'm
[1:48:28] trying to clear that out cuz I'm trying
[1:48:31] to um explain something
[1:48:33] here now when you take a human body amen
[1:48:37] a a human being amen or any organism
[1:48:41] amen sorry I'm trying to uh steal some
[1:48:44] concept of biology amen yes sir take a
[1:48:48] human organism amen you break it into
[1:48:51] sections where we call organ systems
[1:48:55] amen now when you take an organ system
[1:48:57] you break it down you fether break it
[1:48:59] down you have what you call organs right
[1:49:02] now when you take an organ you break it
[1:49:04] down you have tissues now when you get
[1:49:06] tissue you break it down we we have
[1:49:09] cells amen now even in the cells we have
[1:49:13] organel amen yes sir and even those
[1:49:16] organal amen we have little pieces amen
[1:49:20] the basic pieces that come together as
[1:49:24] we call an atom amen amen now in an atom
[1:49:29] right we
[1:49:31] have three um three fellows amen that
[1:49:35] are working together one is positively
[1:49:39] charged one is negatively charged and
[1:49:41] one is neutral yes sir so every atom
[1:49:46] amen has got that now there are some
[1:49:49] atoms let's say uh this is
[1:49:53] atom P amen I just use the word p and
[1:49:57] atom n
[1:49:59] amen now this aom
[1:50:06] amen have got positive negative and
[1:50:09] neutral positive negative and neutral
[1:50:12] amen but for some strange
[1:50:16] reason this one called P easily loses
[1:50:20] the negative charges
[1:50:24] so when it loses a negative charge this
[1:50:28] one has um the character of gaining
[1:50:32] negative charges so when this loses a
[1:50:36] negative charge this one gains the
[1:50:38] negative charge so this one becomes
[1:50:41] positive and this becomes
[1:50:44] negative amen but remember they both had
[1:50:49] positive and negative charges
[1:50:52] but this naturally amen by nature always
[1:50:58] loses the
[1:51:00] negativity and then it becomes
[1:51:04] positive Always by Nature it loses the
[1:51:09] negative amen and this always by Nature
[1:51:13] gains the
[1:51:15] [Applause]
[1:51:16] negative
[1:51:18] amen but the thing is that even in this
[1:51:21] negativity is got positive
[1:51:25] inside but it keeps gaining negative
[1:51:30] charges so this can get to a point where
[1:51:33] it keeps losing negative losing negative
[1:51:37] losing negative and this keep gaining
[1:51:39] negativity until it sees itself negative
[1:51:42] so negative so negative so
[1:51:47] negative but it doesn't realize that it
[1:51:50] has positivity inside
[1:51:52] [Applause]
[1:51:54] [Music]
[1:51:55] amen it didn't realize that it has
[1:51:57] positivity inside amen now there is one
[1:52:02] thing about this Mr P here because he
[1:52:07] has the ability to lose negative
[1:52:10] charges it gets to a point where it is
[1:52:13] able to
[1:52:16] attract that's right so it is not just
[1:52:20] losing the negative charges for no
[1:52:23] reason by gain that power to
[1:52:27] attract that ability to
[1:52:30] attract so when it is speaking the
[1:52:35] word it has the mindset that the word is
[1:52:38] going to come back now when it's going
[1:52:41] to come
[1:52:43] back do you know what he going to do is
[1:52:46] going to pick up this whole thing
[1:52:50] here so uh one example is what we call
[1:52:54] sodium there's um sodium and we have
[1:52:56] chlorine where we have our salt in it so
[1:53:01] so this yeah Mr P which is going to end
[1:53:04] becomes positive and then this
[1:53:08] negative now it is pulling this to
[1:53:12] itself amen what I'm trying to say is
[1:53:15] that when we speak up the word and it
[1:53:17] goes out we become so positive that when
[1:53:22] the word is coming back it is not coming
[1:53:25] back void it is not coming back empty it
[1:53:29] is speaking up amen it is going to pick
[1:53:33] up whatever we are intending Amen to
[1:53:39] receive
[1:53:42] amen
[1:53:44] amen yes
[1:53:46] sir amen amen am thank you Lord my God
[1:53:52] glory
[1:53:56] Lord help
[1:53:58] us amen amen and amen
[1:54:10] amen yes sir
[1:54:14] amen so I I just um want to conclude
[1:54:19] with this
[1:54:21] amen God has given us
[1:54:24] Promises of healing of blessings of the
[1:54:28] Rapture of
[1:54:30] transformation of Christ in his
[1:54:33] fullness amen so it takes the
[1:54:38] attraction of
[1:54:40] rejoicing it takes the attraction of the
[1:54:44] fire we go through in our various lives
[1:54:48] Amen to bring these things to us amen it
[1:54:52] takes the attraction of praising of
[1:54:55] confessing these things that he has said
[1:54:57] to us amen now I want to read this
[1:55:00] quotes Amen in the message who is
[1:55:04] God Amen yes sir who is God it said now
[1:55:09] the believer today most people say he's
[1:55:12] a good man he pays Tidings to the church
[1:55:16] he's a good member that's very fine
[1:55:20] that's a moral life
[1:55:23] amen amen that's a moral life to pay a
[1:55:27] tight to live a good life is moral amen
[1:55:31] amen I said now no one could speak evil
[1:55:35] of that but that's not what I'm talking
[1:55:38] about Jesus judged a man a Believer a
[1:55:42] different type of a character he said
[1:55:45] Jesus the last words that he said when
[1:55:48] he left the world go ye into all the
[1:55:51] world and preach the gospel to Every
[1:55:55] Creature amen is that right it say he
[1:55:58] that believeth is
[1:56:01] baptized shall be saved he that
[1:56:04] believeth not shall be damned is that
[1:56:08] right now the prophet said now every
[1:56:12] church will come that far but what about
[1:56:16] the rest of
[1:56:18] it amen every church will come to that
[1:56:21] level baptized and be saved but what
[1:56:25] about the rest of it I said he said
[1:56:28] these signs shall follow them that
[1:56:30] believe do you believe it it said this
[1:56:33] signs shall follow them that believe in
[1:56:36] my name shall they cast out Devils speak
[1:56:39] with new tongues take up serpent or
[1:56:42] drink deadly things shall not harm
[1:56:45] them now Christ gave a promise when he
[1:56:49] was
[1:56:50] leaving so he sent his
[1:56:53] word amen that in my
[1:56:57] name amen we shall cast out Devils we
[1:57:01] shall take deadly things and it shall
[1:57:03] not harm us we shall take the um the
[1:57:05] serpent it shall it shall not harm us
[1:57:08] he's giving us all these promises amen
[1:57:12] it is not just about baptized and being
[1:57:15] saved that's the end of the story amen
[1:57:19] there are so many things that Christ has
[1:57:22] promise the believer amen and it takes
[1:57:25] us to believe it to have faith in it to
[1:57:29] keep talking about it to keep loving it
[1:57:33] amen and being positive about this that
[1:57:37] will make it accomplish in our lives we
[1:57:41] just bless the name of the Lord amen

[1:58:06] big clap offering
[1:58:11] again praise God should we call this
[1:58:15] part
[1:58:17] one because you have not finished yet
[1:58:20] there is more to sending and receiving
[1:58:24] than what we went through but I'm not
[1:58:26] going to say it you will continue
[1:58:29] it amen Oh Glory Glory Glory Glory to
[1:58:34] God amen amen we want to be those iron
[1:58:37] that loses
[1:58:39] negativity amen by Nature I lose
[1:58:43] negativity by Nature negativity goes
[1:58:46] away from me by Nature I lose negativity
[1:58:51] and I'm always charge
[1:58:54] positive amen fully charg positive Oh
[1:58:58] Glory to God amen amen love it talk
[1:59:03] about it amen stay focused on it and God
[1:59:08] will bring it to pass amen do not put a
[1:59:12] timer on it God knows what is the right
[1:59:15] time for you to receive it and when
[1:59:17] times come that's right there is nothing
[1:59:20] no even hir not even a devil will stop
[1:59:25] you from receiving what God intended you
[1:59:28] to receive amen Oh Glory Glory Glory he
[1:59:33] mentioned something and I saw people
[1:59:36] questioning like pzle L be when he says
[1:59:39] that Nebuchadnezzar saw God in the man
[1:59:43] and then later on when he was talking
[1:59:45] about uh himself saying what the brother
[1:59:48] was trying to express is first God God
[1:59:52] manifested himself through the
[1:59:54] discernment right through the son of man
[1:59:57] ministry as a discernment Nazar saw it
[2:00:01] he confessed it but he never really
[2:00:04] caught the revelation of that God that's
[2:00:07] right if he would have CAU that
[2:00:09] Revelation amen he would not have
[2:00:12] challenged that God but because he
[2:00:15] didn't get the Revelation that's the
[2:00:16] reason why he challenged that God but
[2:00:19] now the second time he saw that God
[2:00:23] now it was no more God in a man but it
[2:00:25] was a personal revelation of
[2:00:27] Nebuchadnezzar saying wait a minute I
[2:00:30] throw three men over there who is that
[2:00:32] fourth one over there now Nebuchadnezzar
[2:00:35] saw the god of Daniel visibly in front
[2:00:39] of him now it becomes a personal
[2:00:42] revelation amen so this message must be
[2:00:45] a personal revelation to you when you
[2:00:49] see that God of the message then no one
[2:00:52] will take that Vision away from you amen
[2:00:56] amen so remember you need to send
[2:00:58] something and when he goes away don't
[2:01:01] put a Time on it but expect it to come
[2:01:04] it will happen when in God's Own time
[2:01:08] but what do you have to do keep loving
[2:01:10] it keep talking about it amen stop self
[2:01:14] beeding yourself brother BR I'm talking
[2:01:17] about self beeding amen sometime it's
[2:01:20] appearing like it's an encouragement but
[2:01:22] really we are just condoning or or just
[2:01:25] playing around with that spirit that is
[2:01:28] around versus bringing a word of faith
[2:01:31] that will strengthen and encourage
[2:01:32] somebody amen wonderful brother said God
[2:01:36] richly bless
[2:01:42] you let's stand
