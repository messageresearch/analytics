do what Only You Can Do Lord and that's come and break the bread of life to our hearts Lord move the veil of Flesh aside Lord take complete control the lord of the mouthpiece that you can speak and that you can have the preeminence Lord you can change the course of this service to follow exactly Lord God what is in Your Divine will for each and every one of your children tonight Lord to receive directly from your hand we're claiming the victory for this service for your glory and for your honor we thank you Lord that the devil has fallen as hard as he has because Lord when the enemy comes in like a flood you lift up a standard against him Lord and we're here tonight and expectation Lord to receive from you so we thank you for that we thank you Lord for every lifted hand and for every need that you will meet Lord even before we walk out these doors tonight Lord that's how you gained your reputation Lord and you're preserving that reputation in our very lives we thank you for it in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen Amen brother Stephen I'm just going to launch right into it tonight and uh we know the Lord we with such a wonderful ministry as the Lord has given you here sometimes I feel like I just scratched the tip of the iceberg and then God sends a Ministry in like this to just unfold the whole thing amen you get a full seven course meal amen and Saint John 11 beginning at verse number 32 then when Mary was come where Jesus was and saw him she fell down at his feet saying unto him Lord if thou has been here my brother had not died when Jesus therefore saw her weeping and the Jews also weeping which came with her he groaned in the spirit and was troubled and said where have ye laid him they said unto him Lord come and see and Jesus wept then said the Jews behold how he loved him and some of them said could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind have caused that even this man should not have died Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the Grave it was a cave and a stone lay upon it Jesus said take ye away the stone Martha the sister of him that was dead saith unto him Lord by this time he stinketh for he hath been dead for days Jesus saith unto her said I not unto thee that if thou Arts believe thou should see the glory of God then they took away the Stone from the place where the dead was laid and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said father I thank thee that thou has heard me and I knew that thou heareth me always but because of the people which stand by I said it that they may believe that thou has sent me and when he had thus spoken he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with grave clothes and his face was bound about with a napkin Jesus saith unto them loose him and let him go amen may the Lord bless the reading of his word and you can be seated tonight amen I want to take that for a title tonight loose him and let him go the prophet of God says in the message the Rapture preached in December the 4th 1965. the first thing is a trumpet and or a voice a shout and then a voice then a trumpet a shout a messenger getting the people ready the second is a voice of the Resurrection the same voice that loud voice in Saint John 11 that called Lazarus from the grave getting the bride together and then the resurrection of the Dead Sea to be called up with it now watch the three things take place the next is what was a trumpet a shout a voice of trumpet now the third thing is a trumpet which always at the Feast of trumpets is calling the people to the feast and that'll be the bride's supper the Lamb's supper with the bride in the sky see the first thing comes forth is his message his message calling the bride together the next thing is a resurrection of the sleeping bride the ones died back in the other ages they're called together and the trumpet the feast in the heavens in the sky why that's the thing that takes place friends we're right there ready now the only thing the church coming out has got to lay before the sun to ripen oh my so I like how the holy spirit is establishing the order of our departure or the order of the Rapture amen he does all three as he is descending it's his message it's his shout together his people on the Earth amen then to wake his sleeping body amen then to meet the Lord in the air to go into the the wedding suppery amen and then the millennial reign amen so I came across this article the other day uh just yesterday and I I guess it was just for you tonight and it's titled this are you held back by invisible shackles [Applause] [Music] Asian owner Asian elephant owners keep their elephants from wandering off by taking a small rope tying it to a wooden post and attaching it to the elephant's leg to the elephant the Rope is nothing more than a string one jerk and the Rope will snap one kick and the post will go flying yet with nothing but the small rope holding it back the elephant stays put how is that possible the answer is that it has little to do with the piece of rope around the elephant's ankle and everything to do with the invisible shackles around the elephant's mind the elephant is strong it's smart it holds incredible potential yet somehow is held back by nothing more than a piece of twine left almost powerless by a lie why doesn't she just break free the strength is there why doesn't she use it when the elephant is still young her owner takes her from her mother and shackles her to a large tree with a heavy chain around her leg for days and weeks the young elephant will strain and pull trying to be to break free but all she succeeds in doing is causing the shackle to cut deep into her leg eventually she gives up and accepts the idea that she can't go anywhere when there is something around her leg soon the owner can replace the tree with a post and the chain with a piece of twine once the elephant feels resistance she stops there's nothing but a piece of twine around her ankle but there are heavy shackles around her mind this is not an article about elephants this is an article about people who are held by something that is almost nothing [Music] but it triggers memories yeah it's something the devil has hooked into your life amen because it created a scar it created an indelible impression upon your mind amen it cannot be removed it seems it cannot be washed it cannot be erased amen so it's there as a tormenting reminder uh something that once held you captive amen and while it may not make you amen any less than a Christian or it cannot unchristianize you it cannot change your identity it can't change your origin as a child of God yet it hinders you from realizing your full potentially man and exercising the freedoms and Liberties that every son and daughter of God was born to enjoy foreign oh my God it says are you like that elephant you have the strength and potential to move forward but are held captive by a lie have you been conditioned to believe what its faults you watch people who are bound in systems you watch people amen it's it's like Stockholm Syndrome where they've been in prison so long they fall in love with the guards they fall in love with the captors they literally fall in love with the people who put them there and that don't just happen in prisons it happens in churches where people fall in love with the very Ministries that have bound to their faith amen by doubt and unbelief and by compromising on the word of God Amen and have attracted followers to themselves even by compromising on the word by writing permission slips where the word doesn't write them by giving people allowances and indulgences and welcoming them to the house of the Lord to the table of the Lord to the communion of the Lord and to The Fellowship of the Saints when their lives do not line up to the gospel that's not Freedom that's not Grace that's not Liberty that is bondage you're creating a prison house amen and you're calling in a church and you're calling it Liberty and you're calling it Grace but Grace Finds Its place in the word of God [Music] amen have you been conditioned to believe what is false or to stop when things feel hard amen let me translate this for you you let a traffic jam keep you out of church you let a dead car battery or a flat tire or a bad day on the job or a little argument with the wife you let something amen stop you just the least amount of resistance is all it takes Amen to stop you from being in the prophet of God said amen if the love of God is in your heart you can hardly wait for those Church doors to open [Applause] amen oh my or to miss out on your unique calling see the devil he cannot change your identity but he can marginalize your success or prosperity in Christ to come to your full adoption to come to your full placing amen and to exercise amen your privileges and Liberties as a child of God amen I don't know if I've said this here before but if we're not careful we're turning even so-called message Believers into modern Catholics in this day and hour we live amen people don't want to fast they don't want to pray they don't want to seek God Amen they want to attend church whenever it can fit on their calendar they want to pay their tithes and offerings amen and they want a holy man to do the praying to do the fasting to seek God Amen for every decision in their life including what kind of car to buy and we have enabled such a thing by the ministry giving that to the people saying I'll be your holy man I'll give you your indulgences I know of pastors that are permitted sisters to cut their hair nowhere in the word of God is such a thing amen but pastors have taken it upon themselves to become the standard as opposed to the word of God it's bondage friend it's bondage amen because if you're living in sin and you're living in a situation that the word of God condemns and that pastor says you're okay he just bound you to himself and when he goes off the word and everything starts to fall apart and everyone who's got the mind of God begins to leave that and find amen a church where they can be fed the pure unadulterated word you feel obligated to that man because he gave you a special permission slip that the word of God doesn't give they're binding disciples to themselves friend you say by the time we don't hear preaching like that well I'm just crazy enough to say it it's the truth amen it's one of the devil's tactics and we might as well say it for what it is oh he surely you won't die no surely you will God said you would and no devil no serpent is Gonna Change what the word of God said real freedom and real Liberty is thus saith the Lord say what the word says light up to the word of God God will give you Grace God will give you Mercy but to continue in sin God's not in that friend amen amen it's bondage it's bondage amen Luke chapter 19. verse 29. Luke 19 verse 29. and it came to pass when he was come nigh to bethphage and Bethany at the mount called the Mount of Olives he sent two of his disciples saying go ye into the village over against you in the which at your entering you shall find a coat tied where on yet never man sat loose him and bring him hither and if any man asks you why do you lose him thus shall you say unto him because the Lord hath need of him amen oh my and they that were sent went their way and found even as he had said unto them and as they were losing the coat the owners there I've said in the dim why Lucy the cult and they said the Lord had need of him this little cult is in so many ways like you and me and so many of God's children and Jesus commissioned his fivefold ministry they went at his behest brother Robert amen they were under a divine order they were under Divine instruction to go amen and liberate this little coach for a special purpose and Jesus could not fulfill prophecy he could not fulfill Isaiah's prophecy and the Old Testament scripture without the involvement and participation of this one little cult so he sent the ministry and he said you're going to find this elected predestinated cult but he's tied up he's Bound by chains of circumstances somebody who thought they owned this little guy has chained him to a post hallelujah amen but your job preacher your job evangelist your job Pastor is to go find that little fella and untie the Rope amen haha glory to God he can't fulfill his purpose until the ministry does theirs and the ministry has come to extend to you the divine order of God to liberate you from what you are bound by and bound to and say God had a greater purpose all along and I'm here to Usher you [Music] oh my I don't know if you were like me but I had a lot of knots in my rope hey man it wasn't easy for me to get loose amen there was guilt there was shame there was complexes there was memories there was all these knots that was keeping me tired to this post but somebody who thoughts who thought they owned me from the day I was born until the day I would die but somebody else somebody else made me created me put a deposit down the inside of me and knew exactly what I was tied to and exactly what it would take to bring me free Glory Hallelujah amen praise God I don't care what you're bound by tonight I don't care what the doctor said I don't care what your parents say I don't care about your past I don't care about your history amen your future was written on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world Hallelujah Hallelujah the Lord amen the Lord has need of him Hallelujah God needs you tonight I believe the prophet of God said the greatest compliment that you could ever pay God is Lord I believe your word [Applause] amen when the son of man returns will he find faith oh yes he will because this seventh angel message amen Hallelujah those seven Thunders are the Mysteries that was contained in the seals and it will be these divinely revealed truths that will literally turn the heart of the children back to the fathers amen to untie the knots the not of Catholicism the knot of every system the nuts of every religion untie all the Nazi men tie up the Loose Ends Hallelujah the same voice the same voice that called Lazarus from the grave amen had a man standing on his feet breathing with the blood pulsating through his veins he had a temperature he had a blood pressure but he was wrapped he was wrapped in a garment that was fearing to a dead person but he wasn't a dead person he was a resurrected Son of God and he said it's time to lose him from the identification that a dance system and a dead religion tried to rap and bind my son in Hallelujah Hallelujah praise God amen amen oh my God glory can you imagine that little donkey going down the street following those disciples aren't you that same little donkey hey man that was born under a death sentence aren't you that same little donkey that nobody had any hope for that nobody saw any worth nobody saw any value amen thought you were gonna be strapped and bound tied by a rope to the post for the rest of your life oh my but somebody spoke something somebody said something that said the fivefold ministry right down to my address I said don't let nobody don't let nobody hinder or interfere I've got need of this little guy scripture is waiting to be fulfilled the wheels of Prophecy have stopped until the five-fold ministry this every night out of the Rope and gets that little fella to The Voice Hallelujah you got a part to play in this friend the Rapture is not going without you the bride can't be perfected without you the sleeping Saints can't rise until you hear that voice and it strips away everything that has bound your faith amen Jesus needed a ride Jesus Needed Somebody to carry him down into Jerusalem oh Jesus Needed Somebody to carry the world's greatest religious heretic right down into the heart of the religious capital so a couple of hundred fanatics could strip the palm branches off the trees throw their clothes in the way and say our King is coming to set up his throne amen he ain't coming he's here [Music] he'd been on the earth for 33 years he'd been preaching for almost three and a half so it wasn't a man it wasn't his coming it was the recognition of his presence already in their midst Amen in the in the religious mainstream will call him a heretic called him a fanatic but to the elected predestinated that's our King that's our salvation that's our Redemption that's our healing that's our release from sins prison [Music] what is the attraction on the mountain prophecy becoming history God fulfilling his word largely unrecognized by the world and by the masses but to a few select Chosen predestinated and elected individuals this was the Fulfillment the wrapping up of that Old Testament dispensation and the introduction of the person Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ praise the Lord oh my and It produced The Worship It produced joy unspeakable and full of Glory and that Pharisees said Master rebuke thy disciples and he said I'll tell you if these should hold their Stone if thee should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out amen oh my future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride now many of you want to put down this word this Greek word pass away brought that out of second Peter chapter 3. how is this world going to pass away and yet we're going to live on it how can the Earth be annihilated and still be a habitable place for God his bride and his kingdom to be established here on this same Earth well this all is a type and an illustration or a pre-figure of what happens to the individual [Music] The Voice of the master loses you annihilates the definition or the identification that once defined you and in the same vessel establishes the kingdom of God on the throne of your heart so his glory can be expressed through you amen if you'll notice some of you people that wants to put it down I'll spell it for you I couldn't pronounce it p-a-r-e-r-e-c-h-o-m-i-a I don't know how to pronounce it now the inspiration strikes me for something then I go back to find out the word now here I can't spell the word I can't pronounce it but in that the Lord is still give me away I go and find out what that means then I got it see then I got it again see heavens and earth will pass away this word means passing from one form to another home this Earthly shall take on the image of the Heavenly right this uh natural will give away the supernatural mortal mortality will give way to immortality bypassing death amen it's just like Jesus turned the water into wine brother Brown said that water would eventually become wine but would have had to come up through the Earth in the grave body to come out but it said Jesus bypass the process that's what happens at the translation because the penalty of death was settled there at Calvary the benefits of Calvary are realized and affected to the believer in this hour who has heard the same voice and that voice has a transformative effect on your life which is already begun when you heard the voice come out of her my people you left hey man oh my how'd he say it when you heard that eagle cry and you left that other thing you've heard from your theophany amen you've been changed into the very living image of the Living God amen this is not the words of a man his words will fail you're not feeding on a man you are feeding all the unfailing body word of the son of man okay praise God it's inevitable Rapture is inevitable translation is inevitable amen because the effect of the voice is irreversible and its effect in your life amen cannot in any way be disturbed by Satan [Applause] [Music] amen praise God [Applause] it means passing from one form to another it does not mean Annihilation as the English word would mean pass away it's annihilated but the Hebrew word or the Greek word there here does not mean pass away it means from passing from one thing to another friends to pass from one condition foreign how many of you does Satan try to defeat your faith based on your condition [Music] that's that twine that he wants to keep around your ankle to hold your spiritual mind from realizing a man that you are free from that he references Paul used it put it down you can read it later Titus 3 5 Paul is using the same word means the Regeneration of man that man has passed from a sinner to a saint not completely annihilated when a man is changed he isn't annihilated but he's a changed person he has been changed from what he was to what he is what gives you the right little cult to follow these ministers down the street away from your old identity I don't know it's something they say he said [Music] it's something they tell me said and evidently they believed it enough to put their lives on the line and keep working on that rope until every night was out hey I'm just following them to him amen I'm just following them to him and when I get to him he'll do with me whatever he wishes to if they want to put garments on me if they want to throw palm branches in my way if they want to shout if they want to scream if they want to break Church order whatever they want to do I'm not responsible I'm just doing what somebody told these disciples I should do and if he can be glorified by climbing on my back and letting me carry him foreign [Applause] little donkey little donkey he's illegitimate I don't care this is the best life I've ever had up until about 15 minutes ago I was chained to a post [Applause] why should I care what they say I'm following what he said I've never gotten so much attention in all my life I've never seen such a reaction in all my life amen I didn't start this I sure ain't gonna stop it let God have his way [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah he who the son hath made free is free indeed [Applause] God didn't ask my opinion he didn't ask your opinion he just determined that's my son that's my daughter I'm gonna get Glory out of their life [Applause] Hallelujah Jesus used the same word Matthew 19 28 or 28 19. 1928 said to them you're set with me in my father's Kingdom regenerated you see changed when you're changed he used the same word he used the same word when he said to the cult loose The Cult and let him go destroy and remove everything that bound him remove whatever binds remove whatever hinders remove whatever is keeping that little fella from expressing what I created to do same thing at the resurrection of Lazarus loose him change him he's been tied let him go what does it mean the Earth will be loosed from the grip of Satan it'll be loose it'll be loose from politics loose from denominational religious systems to be used for the kingdom of God to be establish it here on the Earth but as long as it's in the hands of Satan politics Satan the ruler of the earth he owns it it belonged to him but now Christ has redeemed it one time I was his property but not now one time that little woman was his property but not now see he come to loose the grip of it he loosed the grip of sin of Satan upon my life upon your life and now we're not his how often you have heard me say in prayer take your hands off of God's Property see amen have faith to claim your own then let me tell you something when they reoccupied Canaan they weren't taking the Canaanites land from them they were taking their land back your healing your salvation your joy every promise in the word of God you not taking that from the devil you're taking yours back you're dispossessing what the devil is illegally occupying to see if you've got enough gumption if you've got enough faith if you've got enough realization Amen to realize there's no more chains there's no more ropes amen there's nothing holding you except your own unbelief [Applause] amen you you don't need Psychology you need faith faith comes from the word of God to show you within the word this is you this is your inheritance this is your promise step into it and occupy it take your hands off of God's Property see amen have faith to claim your own that's your rights take your hands off of her take your hands off of him see faith will do it oh my not annihilate it but just take your hands off of it to loosen Let It Go pass it away it changes the Earth will change politics Will Change the religions will change the denominations will pass away politics will pass away the kingdom of God shall be established amen the thief Jesus said Saint John 10 10 the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy I am calm that they may have life and that's not just existence that's not just a blood pressure 98.6 that they might have it more abundantly remember the story of Johnny Crow he was tied to the tree and one day the string got cut but Johnny came walking in the same Circle because now that's what the gospel does amen have the faith of God Amen the mind of Christ is restoring his mind you his identification to you that's how Satan imposed another identity on Eve was by translating and interpreting the word to her Oh it sounded polished it sounded fancy it sounded liberating but it was bondage don't let any man redefine God's word to you God meant exactly what he said just the way he said it have

that you don't know be willing to lay down take your hand off so somebody can help you untie that cooked and take you to another level be very humble do you hear me be very humble to see that what I'm looking at now I didn't know it and humble yourself and let that Ministry take you and told you where Christ wants you to be amen amen if you are wrong that's okay we all make a mistake but don't stick to the wrong to justify yourself it doesn't take away your Christianity God only wants to lose you into a certain area admitting doesn't mean so that you were not Christian do you hear me do you hear me what happened to Lazarus doesn't mean he was not a believer everybody okay it doesn't mean you are not a Christian it's just there is a certain area that have been bonding you for so long and that area is impacting everything else in your life and every time you're trying to do something you already you always filter things through that area that area become your thinking man filter you go through that area first and when you filter that area then you look at everything in your life through that lens and that's why your vision is blurred I know what I'm talking about the brother was not here when I was preaching about the the seals and the Thunders who told him about it do you see do you see that it's not me it is not even him somebody is repeating something because he knows what he's talking about and he's talking to you all he tried to do is get you off where you were and free you that's right Stephen amen Hallelujah let's go to First Corinthians chapter 15. I wish the whole church was here and hear what was preached tonight Hallelujah the Bible say moreover brethren I'm giving you a few seconds if you have not found it yet First Corinthians chapter 15 verse 1. Paul say moreover Brethren I declare unto you the gospel which I preach unto you which also ye have received and where will ye stand so somebody preached the gospel you already received the gospel and you are standing on the gospel and we have a message that we have already received watch verse two you ready he say by which also ye are saved the same gospel that you receive ye are saved amen some are not saved then we need to lose you some are already saved but they are still tight memories cut disappointment many things bad things that happen molestation in childhood abused and you can't let it go I know what the Holy Ghost is saying I know what the holy spirit is saying amen verse 2 by which also ye are saved if you do what keeping water what does God want you to keep in memory how much how many people disappointed you what you did in the past how you backslide in the past what does God want you to keep in memory why does God want you to keep in memory his word why what is the purpose of you keeping his word in memory why the greatest battle ever thought it's right here you gotta let things go if your mommy never treated your daddy good you cannot take that to your marriage you didn't get me if you never had a good childhood do you follow me because you were abused do you follow me because your daddy was a drunker brother branham's dad was a drunker what kind of home did Brother Branham came out of it how could he carry a message so sacred like this anybody okay don't make your children suffer because of you because you keep carrying that package from that time from today you can take a stand and say I don't want my children to experience what I experience I don't want it I don't want my husband to experience what I went through I don't want my wife to experience what I went through I want to change my life I want to break that Circle I want to be different than my biological family you are not here to keep caring the tradition of the family my father did this this is the way we are this is the way we so and so are this is the way our family behave we are not part of that family we are part of the family of God the name of our family is Jesus Christ body push break turn your engine off stop abusing whatever past you went through God allowed do you follow me do You Follow Me Maybe daddy left the mama God knew why daddy have to leave Mama for you do you follow me maybe you had to be taken to another home and be a foster child God knew why you must be because if you probably would not go that route you would not be in the message that's why the Bible say everything worked together for good no matter what path you coming up that's why we can say amen that's why we can sing Amazing Grace an angel cannot everybody here so don't take that childhood and then bring it there and make your wife suffer everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay I thought someone I say you marry a woman that didn't grow up with a father what do you expect from her what do you want her to do when you marry her you're not just that husband you have to be a father because now she's looking at you as a father so you are a brother you remember Solomon say my sister my spouse you are a brother then you are a husband then you must remember you must feel the void of a father because that's the way he grew up he's a victim of circumstances he didn't choose that that's the way it happened the Bible said that Isaac took Rebecca to his home and he was comforted of his mother Rebecca comforted Isaac for the lust of his mother do you know the scripture God verify the home so what what Comfort are you bringing are you the troublemaker anybody okay and you always nice when visitors are there because you have to show up that your message believer to the visitor as soon as the visitor leave back to Tom and Jerry but here another way to keep you sweet and home we need to get a brother and make him be a roommate in your house so well so your wife will breathe because every time you remember the brother is there you have to be heavily like a question [Music] [Laughter] but I can get to a deep surgery but I need to let you go home but you know what I'm talking about verse 2 by which also ye are saved if you keep in memory the things that the devil did to you I still can't take it I still can't every time I think about this thing I still not have realized yet in two years you still have now relaxed you're wasting your time dump it in the garbage can keep moving that person is living their life they don't care about you you're wasting your life wasting your time glory to God by which also you are saved if you keep in memory what I preach unto you unless I got that scripture sitting there unless you have believed in water so if you don't keep in memory you have believed in vain this is the scripture look at Paul can I continue he said for I have delivered unto you first first of all that which are also received it's not the message of Paul it's the message of God through Paul how that Christ die for our sins according to the water why does it start back on Calvary that's why he wipes everything that's what that's that's the starting point to wipe all your past how can you live in a marriage remembering the mistake you made in your childhood crying all the time because of a scar everybody here and that he was buried and that he rose again everybody okay the third day according to the scripture and that he was sin of cephas then of The Twelve after that he was seen of about 500 Brethren at once of whom the greater party remained unto this present but some are fallen asleep because the Christian they don't die after that he was seen of James then to of all the apostles and last watchpower and last I told the story The testimony of everybody but I'm also part of that testimony at last at last everybody okay of all he was sin of me also watch me as of one born out of what due time for I am the list of the apostle that I am not meant to be called a water who was Paul an apostle he was watching and I call an apostle because I did what I persecuted the water that's a memory in Paul look how he's crushing that memory you ready watch how he's crushing the memory in the next verse he said because I persecuted the Church of God but do you see first then do you see do you see in other words that always carry my antidote every time the devil will come back and say you Paul you persecuted the church you were bad you're a liar you're not supposed to preach this gospel Paul have the appropriate weapon do you hear me you hear me he said bye to verse 10 by the water [Music] by the grace of God I water can you read louder hey I am water in other words I am just the way I am regardless of what you know I am what I am how can a man like me Paul preach the gospel and people accepted me a man who get in the city everybody ran away by the grace of God I am what I am and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in water so you holding to your memories if you want to go home you can go I have to finish what I have to finish you holding on in your memory you are actually making the grace of God vain Hallelujah which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but even I'm the least of the Apostles look how Paul rise up as a messenger but I labor more abundantly than day water how can he say something like that he understood the power of Grace in either way God put me as a messenger I am what I am he chose me regardless of my past I'm gonna be what he told me to be and then I'm gonna preach with that complex and when I see Peter good deviating I will tell Peter in the face I say Peter what you're doing is not the word of God Paul didn't say if I talk to Peter Peter will say you know what you did to the Church of the god right Paul didn't look at that that way I am what I am whatever was passed today is put under the blood and no fishing Hallelujah he said a more abundantly than they are yet not I but the water look at the power but what the grace of God which was inward with me what else do you want us to preach to you for you to get what else a psychiatrist cannot give you this what was given tonight you cannot get it from psychiatrists they will put you on the medication how many medication you've been through how many counseling you've been through you don't want to give up you don't want to give up you even praise your weakness in our family we tremble like this in other words I'm accepting that in my family things like this happen this is what happened my father Heaven my uncle heaven and this is what happened you accepting it ah no I am not a child of hella Branham anymore I understand my family stop this thing buddy I'm calling your body because we're friend we are family amen God spoke tonight keep his word in memory keep what he told you tonight in memory keep the message in memory play their message when you are in the car play the message at home pray listen to the word because it will help you keep that in memory read the Bible when you're at work when you are home read your Bible spend time live that crazy social media away where you have to be pleasing people you please people you miserable you don't even look like the way you posting online because you are brushing the picture you will take seven pictures and choose the one that looked the most
