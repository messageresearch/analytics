people at home so fifty-fifty everybody's happy for his God before we say the majority Wayne was 50/50 first Kings chapter 17 verse 1 if you dare you can say Amen we appreciate everybody this tonight and on the virtual platform on YouTube God richly bless you brother David thank you for everything your bishop first one and elijah the tishbite is this I'm gonna go slow brother Maurice you day you can let me know when it's time to cover and Elijah the Tishbite who was of the inhabitant of Gilad say to her air hub as the Lord God of Israel lives before who must stand there shall not be do nor rain thank you my brother here but according to my word you might be seated so on verse 1 we found out that the first time Elijah comes on the same he's bringing a curse on Israel and the curse he's bringing on Israel is specific it's a curse by stopping the rain from falling down on the nation why does the curse hit the rain or affect the rain why he didn't affect the rivers why he didn't affect the land while he why he didn't affect the wild beasts but he was very specific in this stage Israel already seen Israel left God through a hub they kill the Prophet they left the commandment of God every clock of God but at this stage when God send Elijah the prophet Elijah comes and bring a curse but that curse is related to the rain everybody clear let's job two verse six and the Raven brought him bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening and he drunk of the brook so he was said to a Brooke that Brooke was still having water because the curse just happened and he came to pass after a while that the book dried up there is on the brook dried up because there is no more rain so the land was affected but for your information it was not only Israel that was affected because after this Elijah is sent back as a dove easier to zurafa where there is a widow and when he went there we found out that that we do already was living under the curse as well so the rain did not only affect Israel but it affected also the surrounding country so everybody was affected by this curse or this plague that came upon the nation everybody did and it came to pass again verse 7 after a while that the brook dried up because there was no rain because they had been no rain in the land so the bread was affected the water was affected because there was no rain rain brings crops because the old civilizations were living by agriculture so when you stop the rain it's already affecting the economy when you affect the economy there is no herbs there is no weed there is no bread so meaning everybody is starving in other word famine hits him so by stopping the rain he opened a door into famine into the land everybody clear no end no crop no when there is no crop there is no agriculture there is no wheat no burning because there's no rain everybody clear let's go to the Book of Amos chapter 8 we are just building from where we stopped last time on Sunday Amos chapter 8 and for those that are on line or those that now are going to be with viewing later I will strongly encourage you if you miss a sermon whether it's me preaching or brother Mike or whoever make sure before Sunday you go back and you review that before Sunday because if we're building something on Wednesday you miss it on Sunday you might be lost trying to catch up everybody cleared almost chapter 8 verse 11 the day's come saith the Lord God that I will send Fermin everybody clear there is a famine there in the land not a famine of bread nor thirsty for water when Elijah brought the curse into the world he brought famine that famine affected the bread and also affected the water everybody there but there is another prophecy that came in for the antrum that they will be famine because the Old Testament is a shadow or it had but in the end time there is a famine but the Bible is specific that it is not natural bread salmon everybody there what Israel was doing naturally the church is doing that in the spiritual everybody Gill so it's not a famine of bread and water but the famine here is about something else the Bible say that it's not firm enough not thirsty for water but of hearing the words of the Lord in other word there will be a problem or there will be a lack of the Word of God everybody clear in the end time this is under Elijah that's the intima but do we have any large idea anthem okay verse 12 and there shall wander from sea to sea and from the North even to the east they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord and shall not find it so somebody will be looking for the world the vision will be rare the world will be rare but this are not funded everybody clear remember Israel was looking for Elijah and nobody could find Elijah Elijah was hidden somewhere by a brook being fed by the Raven and later on by a widow woman everybody clear now let's go to the book of Revelation chapter 6 very familiar Scripture we should be very familiar with the seals now when I say the first year the second year it should not be Greek if you have a problem so you got a review the sermons that we had since leaving word Tabernacle everybody their flesh in chapter 6 first father if you dare you can say Amen and when he opened the third seal this is now the third seal what does the third seal have to do here and when he opened the third seal I heard the third beast say the anointing of men come and see and I beheld and lo a black horse and he desaad on him had a pair of balance in other words scale your zodiac told us that he was Libra you remember a pair of steel in his hand on the third seal the first symbol that appeared after the cavern here is a scale or a balance everybody clear what does he mean as hell I know we only we all know that it means that they are selling food and things why the scale everybody clear verse six and I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny so there is a trade going on there is some commercial activity happening here where they are selling wheat to a certain price because the scale in the Bible speak of trading speak of selling things there were selling things by scale that's why God spoke in the book of Proverbs to make sure your scale is right because you don't want to be cheating people everybody clear so there is one measure of weight here one measure of wheat for what for a penny now when we think our American Way what a penny is it's nothing you can part with a penny now nothing if they give you one cents you're not going to buy anything if you take them and tell it to into the scripture you're not gonna get it because what Branham say the Bible is an Eastern book you need to understand the Bible according to the Eastern culture then you're going to find out what a penny really worth a penny in our Western civilization it's nothing but in the Bible it means something everybody clear because there is a famine in the land somewhere and they are selling one measure of weight for a penny the Bible continued he say and three measure of barley for what for a painting we have three measures of barley we have wheat here everybody clear and barley both wheat barley mix bread over here no bread here no water in the last day bread water spiritually speaking the Word of God are we there now in the third seal there is a scale coming up where they're selling wheat and barley at a certain price which rod Radames say they are the stuff that they make bread so bread is the gain effectively everybody clear praise God and three measures of barley for a penny and see you hurt not G all and the one I'm gonna write it here when it comes to the third seal there is four element to the torture the first one is there is a scale which speaking about the Train everybody there the economy and everything the second thing we have wheat and we have barley both of these the Bible call them corn when the say corn or grain it either barley or each week and then the other element is wine and the last one is oil when the third sell it it's affecting the economy very clear when the third seal heat is gone affect bread when the third sell heat under the church hedges they told the devil touch not the oil and the Weinman if not therefore would have messed it up everybody there and see you hurt not the oil and the one let's pray them Heavenly Father Lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy and for giving us an opportunity to gather together here presently and on virtual broadcast through YouTube lon father thank you for opening the door again for Wednesday service Lord father we thank you for giving us strength and even to have desire god father to be streaming or to yearn for your word father it's nothing but a blessing Lord we thank you and we want to commit this service unto the hand asking you Lord Father that you surrender every one of us under the anointing of the Holy Spirit may you move me complete we happy with the inside teacher Lord may come and teach a word to your children Lord father strengthen those that are feeble Lord may you hear those that are sick father may you touch those that need a special touch Lord in a certain area in the life Lord may your revelation be poured on to not logg depend not only these those that are all stream them home or anything or in their car or a word Lord father or maybe later on they wanna backload father to watch this sermon father may the anointing continue to throw the same work is flowing north father with the tip of this message father Lord Jesus class we ask everything Lord it's been great blessings from the Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen grab a table good to see you we're going to continue with the unparent of god malachite for when we deal with the subject of Malachi 4 we are specifically dealing with the spirit of Elijah and in order to understand the spirit of Elijah we need to understand first the fact that God does not change what God does something one time God will continue to do that thing repeatedly because God does not improve and you can trace God you can predict God you can chase God and find out where God is because God does not change and neither does the anointing of God changing if you receive the anointing of the larger is going to make you behave like Elijah when the anointing of Elijah came on Elijah and the Sun and the ball was dead Elijah climb on the boy and brought him back to life when there are not in job done in Elijah if you remember Elijah also met a woman who was barren and that woman had a son and later on the woman had a son stroke and died and Elijah clam on the boy and put his mouth to his mouth eyes to his eyes pray the Lord and the ball also came back to life and we found out in this end time that for some reason brother Branham had a friend by the name of a lodge I gave you the code last time II like why was brother branham friend collie Lodge why what what I've had many friends one was probably DiMaggio carrion one was dr. lancer Allen or his friend none of them died either the only one that died was brother a lodge and the only one that brother branham have to clamp on him and put his mouth to his mouth as to his eyes hand to his head to bring him to resurrection was only brother a Raj and if you look you will see her right here how the word Elijah was hidden right there telling you that you are dealing with the anointing of Elijah again it is in nature it is in the zodiac it is in the pyramid it is also in the written word so when we looked at that we approached something less time where brother Branham say that the unchangeable God with the intangible character and he is characteristic remain just the same he cannot change his characteristic he cannot do it if he does it he's not the same yesterday today and forever but God is perfect God is infinite God does not change whatever he takes out the decision the first time is going to remain forever to everybody clear anything is known by age characteristic that's the reason why we are shaping the Ministry of brother Branham from the zodiac into the pyramid into the written word back and forth until you yourself come to a conclusion who brother Branham is what is this message to us in this endtime not the pastor say not brother Stephen say not mamasay note I was born in a message nor I grew up in a message not a new somebody in the message but you get a true revelation what this ministry is and once you are convinced then you're going to be concerned convinced them concern everybody clear now when we looked at Elijah when we were establishing his ministry we found out that his anointing comes fathoms but among those five towns there is one time that his anointing is not dealing with a Jewish nation but his anointing was dealing with the Gentile nation but Abraham say in the message the fifth seal he said look at Moses ministry Elijah was a prophet to all nations are you there so Elijah anointing can be both working in the Jewish nation or alike the anointing can also be working into a giant our nation everybody clear but Moses was a lawgiver to the Jews only so you cannot predict the spirit of Moses coming back right here or doing something Moses will go back to the Jews and matter of fact he appeared the first time and the second time he is going to appear when we are no longer on this earth but we got to be up there into the marriage supper and he says Moses is that damned Jews saying wait we are still keeping the law here but he stands but he is then Moses himself and here is Elijah standing with him Oh see he comes to the Jews only see Moses only went to the Jews the prophet Elijah was to all the nation brother Branham is decoding something here with Jewish people Jewish people are very strict to the religion Jewish people were even forbidden to go and help other nation even Jesus Christ himself it is that Jesus declared that he was sent only to the lost sheep of earth Israel that's why the syrophoenician who hard time she thought she can impersonate the Jewish approach and called Jesus Christ son of David but still it didn't work until a revelation struck here that you need to call him son of God because son of God is when Jesus is dealing with the Gentile through the seven churches so even though it was not the dispensation yet but the grace of God are folded a door for her to understand the proper way to approach Jesus Christ and what she did by the gentle door which is the Son of God which is God working through the seven churches then God stop and turn around and give unto her what she wanted so Elijah right here was a Jewish man as well in the scripture so it was not easy for Elijah a Jew to go ahead and to deal with a gentle woman in this country of Sodom a widow in saritha just leave Israel and go there he was a Jewish prophet so in order for God to prepare Elijah everybody clear God gave him an experience with something that he knew better by the law that he was unclean remember Peter everybody clear so God give him an experience with the Raven so before he goes first and deal with the gentlewoman God have to prepare him into a different ministry just like Peter Peter noodle Oh Peter knew exactly what to do but God knew that if I tell Peter is go to the house of Cornelius Peter will refuse it he will say no there is no way a Jew can go and deal with a gentle so God had to give him a vision and bring something that according to the law looks on cleaner yet God declared that he was not unclean he was cleaner and by the time for even people meant go to the house of Cornelius the Bible declared to us that Cornelius was adjustment the Bible says that Cornelius was a man that was good giving arms to the people the Bible declared to us that Cornelius was praying and was fearing God and we there and not only that Cornelius even encountered the angel of God so in the eyes of Peter he will never think something like that could happen to agenda only Jews see angels only Jews worship God but God has to prepare him with experience with a vision to prepare his heart that hey I am fixing to leave Israel and to begin to deal with the gentle Israel rejected God now it's the time that I'm going to change this translation from the dispensation of dealing with the Jews all the way to the dispensation of dealing with the gentle God also prepare a larger in the Old Testament under the same way in other words you're going to deal with something that's going to entertain you that's going to sustain you that's going to give you food but that which is going to bring you food is now going to be something that is legally by the law clean if I tell you God to a widow woman a Gentile woman if you go to that woman she's going to give you food you won't like it you say no no no no no God why there is many women in Israel here why do you send me to the Gentile so God have to prepare him in order to send him to a ministry everybody clear before there was a man by the name of Jacob Jacob in the scripture loves the Rachel with all his heart Jacob was sleeping dreaming about Rachel Jacob was talking about Rachel Jacob could not sleep at all because of Jacob because of Rachel when he went to his father-in-law and he talked he to his father-in-law he said father-in-law I want to be your son-in-law what is going on I love Rachel they told him that you're going to work seven years everybody else if you tell a young man here you need to go to work before you get married it's a trouble are we there if you tell a young man here like before you get married you want to wait seven years who's going to do that today but the Bible said because Jacob loved nature he didn't see those seven years as something that was great so love overcome trouble if there is a true love in a marriage if there is a true love in the church it's not going to be label it's not going to be things that we are doing because we must do it's not going to be somebody pushing you to do something but if no fingers will be easy the yoke will be easy because love covers a multitude and give Rachel auntie Jacob they took Leah and give it to Jacob again and the Bible say leah was hated everybody clear so God sometime have to give you an experience to prepare you into something I would God have to let Jacob deal with Leah leave me flee as a white man he doesn't one before he get to Rachel God sometime can let you go to a hard experience it is not to lose you but it's an experience to prepare you for something that he's fixing to do in your life so you need to know God and discern him by the spirit so when Elijah went to this woman I'm going to come back to this code brother branham say this little woman must have been of the caliber of elijah everybody here when we went to the house of Cornelius while Peter was preaching the Word of God didn't notice that the Holy Spirit came exactly the same way like he came on them on the day of Pentecost and when the Jewish asked him he said wait a minute they received the Holy Ghost not in the different way than I either they received the Holy Ghost and guess what they begin to speak in tongues when we receive the Holy Spirit we also began to speak in tongues oh so God did not make a difference between them and us because God is no respecter of various and Peter we're on the same caliber they were all children of God one was just born a Gentile one was born a Jewish but when the Holy Spirit counsel there is no difference in the experience of the Holy Ghost they were in the same nature same caliber ellebra clear he says because usually your action shows what you are and again she has been chosen to entertain God's prophet Elijah already got used to the crowd entertaining him now it's not a big deal remember she was a gentle not a Jew the dispossession the spirit of Elijah the anointing of Elijah is leaving the Jewish nation into the gentle but the problem is when you got anointing goes to the gentle the gentle have a dispensation called the seven churches we have the first church the second the third all the way to the seven but which age is going to qualify to have the spirit of right is he going to be in the age of Paul he's going to be in the age of that seriously or what it's clear now that the spirit of Elijah will be working into a gentle nation but which church age are clear then brother Brian continue he says the land was burning up judgment was hearing the lane and no doubt that this little woman being of that caliber being of L deliver Cornelius was a believer everybody here okay top four we see that God would not have caught her if she had not have been worthy to entertain God's prophet for he would not have he will never send his prophet to a house that was our D was the house of Cornelius who already he was a worthy house go with up to chapter 10 you will see that the man was lined up in the scripture everybody clear so God know when he sent Peter already he was not his choosing he was God's choosing he was not her bidding he was God bidding in other world out of many Widow that existed in that time God knew who was the true Widow that can receive the message of Elijah and to swallow it let's go to the Book of Luke chapter 4 I hope my speed is not too quick so we can let this sink slowly if you dare you can say Amen Luke chapter 4 verse 25 Oh you paid disaster okay but I tell you of a truth this is Jesus speaking many widows were in so when you look naturally speaking Israel had many Widow and they qualified to entertain probably Elijah because they were Jews by Nature but God left completely the Jews people left those Widow and went after a gentle Widow everybody clear there were many widows well in Israel in the days of who Elijah when the heaven was shut up three years and six month the Bible is very specific of the area or the timing this happened not when Israel was still under the blessing but when Israel was under the curse everybody clear when great word everybody here can you check your board when great word so famine was already heating the land so right here what I want you to recall is when Elijah who left the Jewish nation and was going into a gentle nation both the Jewish nation and the gentle nation were under famine keep the demand everybody okay and when great famine was throughout all there not just the Jewish land verse 26 but to none of them this is why it's great he was God choosing - none of them was Elijah Elijah water a larger central Malakai phone I will send you Elijah so Elijah will be sent to a gentle woman not a Jew not a widow in Israel but they will be ascending of Elijah to the gentle I will send you Elijah the Prophet everybody clear so far but none of them knows Elijah sent except to Sarepta gentle a city of Sodom gentle to a woman that was a widow one in a million several women there but grace was floating around and graves went over to pick up a gentle bride a gentle church chose him because by law we didn't qualify Paul say that we were outside the Commonwealth of Israel we were not partaking of the promises of the father but he took the cross of Jesus Christ to take the blessing of the first one and put it on the younger one that's why the woman has the two sticks which symbolize the cross everybody clear with the house of Cornelius it's the same thing now when Elijah appeared the first time in the Bible Elijah struck the rain or affected the rain why did he affect rain let's go to the book of Deuteronomy chapter 11 if I can you have this one point so we'll be good for Sunday it's Wednesday so let's it as a bubble study at our Bible study is always coupled with the message you preach Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery autonomy chapter 11 everybody there verse 10 this is God speaking about the Land of Israel for the land were you going to possess God is talking to the Jews you want to go to the priests land but I'm going to give you a description a characteristics some characteristic about this land he said for the land where you go in to possess it is not as the land of Egypt it's a different land from where you came out where you saw your seed and water it with your foot as a garden of application it was a man-made technology to order the crop but Israel is not a man-made technology it's a technology that comes from heaven over there watch verse 11 but they learned where you go to possess it is a land of hills and valleys and drinks water of the rain of heaven so this land totally depend from the rain a very clear and the master of the rain is the Lord Jesus Christ everybody clear verse 12 now a land which the Lord your God careful so God is watching over that the eyes of the Lord your God are always upon it everybody clear from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year in other world 360 days God is instantly watching over the Land of Israel and sending rain to sustain the Land of Israel now watch verse 14 that I will give you the rain of your land in its due season everybody clear the first women or the former rain and the latter rain that you make gather in your corn remember corn here is speaking of wheat and barley everybody clear that you may gather in your corn and your wine I want you to watch this it thirsty very clear when you affect the rain the rain according to the scripture brains corn it brings wheat and barley he also bring wine everybody there and the last one and your oil everybody clear so when Elijah affected the rain he automatically affected these three elements in other word the third seal was already hearing the nation's we okay three elements the width or the barley which are the corn the wine and we will have also the old now let's go to the book of Joel chapter 2 you read the scripture superficially you're gonna come up with a superficial understanding when they say no more rain in other word what they are saying is no more corn no more weed no more barley no more wine no more oiler everybody clear and we found those element were sealed under the third shield Joe chapter 2 verse 23 if you dare you can say Amen the Bible said be glad that you children of Zion rejoice in the Lord your God for he has given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former and the latter rain in the first month you need both rains it's a teaching there according to brother Branham one is moving and the other one we will get to that later on and the floor shall be full of water everybody clear wheat and the VATS are overflow with water wine and so the rain it is connected always with those elements once you affect the rain you are setting the bread you are setting the width you are setting the barley you are affecting the one you are setting the oil so well Elijah moving earlier when Israel seen Elijah coming and struck open the third seal - struck Israel over here because when the first seal open is stroking the winter he have felt that the wine and the oil the old God said don't touch the wine and the old and were here now let's continue in verse 25 the Bible say and I will restore to you so something will be affected the oil will be affected the lion will be affected the weight will be affected but there will be a restoration Elijah must come to restore all things everybody clear and I will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten the King Quran and they can appear and the Pandorum my great army which are sent among you there is a restoration connected here why because things are gonna go into chaos are you there now if you remember in the seals when we have the first four seals you should be familiar with this now we found out that that there is a seal that we described here which is the third seal there is a Libra that the zodiac toad has a scale and when the scale comes the release those three elements are affected with it but the problem is they say a measure of wheat for a penny emerge three measures of barley for a penny a penny according to the Jetta nothing but what about to the Jewish let's go to the book of Matthew chapter 20 if you dare you can see you man my future 420 Matthew chapter 20 verse 1 everybody clear praise God somebody saw that already oh the kingdom of heaven is like - amen that is a household a householder which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard so there is a boss a man here died of wealth he has a business he need employee I'm putting that in our Center a very clear verse - and when he agree with the labor the employees for water in a penny one so the penny in the Bible is not the Western penny over here the penny is a salary of the entire day if you are paying $20 an hour and you work ten hours into a shift meaning you making $200 a day so one measure of barley cause one hamburger cost $200 you see oh so the tonsil is already telling you that there is a problem with the economy there is a famine in the land there is no loan in the land the land is affected and because there is a scarcity there is a lack of food everybody is raising the lack of masks due to coronavirus the masks are getting higher in price why economy is affected then the price of the food in Queens in subscribe they increase in Walmart why because famine the tracksuit is here in the nation so a measure of wheat what you need to eat for one day begin to cost you a salary for the entire day what the speaks of famine famine both naturally and spiritually everybody clear we clear there okay brother branham help me now the fictional now let notice the third seal everybody see that hello buddy Silla let notice the third seal now this is the brother wanna meet friend why is he famine he never he just say it's famine if you don't understand just say mmm and wait until the anointing come on the five for ministry and they're going to pick up those things and explain it to you are we there now you understand why brother Branham say the third seal is firming over here now Matthew 24 seven and eight let's get seven and eight in Matthews and nation shall rise against and Kingdom against Kingdom and they shall be famine I drop down to one steel we shall get that that is the third opening is in a congregation say Amen Matthew 24 seven and eight I'm sorry now that opens the earth why did brother Branham say this never give you an explanation that's why brother Branham say if I take one seal preach it the way God give to me I will preach one cell for three mantra in other word what you read in one book is lauded the transyl is feminine and not only is the tensor framing brother branham said he open up the rain while rain because when effect though which well affect the valley when effect the wine and when affect them all those three element were under their consular everybody clear they open up the rain or their he's saying feminine rain so when elijah comes and struck the rain in other world elijah is opening the door to the tracks here Israel was under famine that's why Luke chapter 425 said there was a great sermon everybody here so if there was a great famine what about the folks here we know by the scripture that folks you when the cavalry came out his name was called death his name was called death and we clear if not open about we clear his name was called death so if you remember when Elijah met the widow women after that he said I need a little bit of bread and after the bread the woman replied she said you know what she'll either have a cake all I have is water I only have all and a little bit the meal and what I'm trying to do is to prepare food for me and my son to eat hand and water and die so when Elijah was under preparation hit the gentlewoman or to go to the gentlewoman the third she was already running its course I'm going slowly then wonderful Syl begin to work was already under the anointing of death are you there that's why Elijah appeared to the woman in other word the Ministry of Elijah will appear to the Genta at the force field and the fo'c'sle is the angel anointing that's going to fight the pair rather which is death everybody clear what about the first and the second zero you wanna so no worries let's go to first King chapter 19 I'm just describing you why is brother branham appearing with all this stuff with pulling them up from the Bible from the by bow first Kings chapter 19 if you dare you can say Amen we already explained the kids and the Ministry of Elijah right now watch carefully Elijah was in the caves before the Sun sent mountain experience everybody remember that because he was after the cave that's when the world wood came out and split and a rock which when all of that everybody here but watch before he goes to sunset mountain before he goes to that experience with the whirlwind strutting the rock and then busting rocks or plan what happened to Elijah what his description let's take verse 1 I want to drop something he just came back and told Jezebel oh that Elijah had done and without how he had slain all the Prophet with death so Elijah had a sword are we clear so Elijah with the jente will have a sword that he is going to through the false prophet and we know everybody clear I'm gonna go slowly until you sit down you say done deal he is Malachi for everybody there now let's go to verse 9 and he came there to a cave and launched them and behold the word of the Lord came to him and he said unto Him what do you do here what do you hear Elijah and he said I have been very zealous for the Lord God of hosts for the children of God of Israel has forsaken your covenant so the first thing Elijah is describing here is the children of Israel for sector commandment the Covenant because remember when we explained Moses before the end or the death of Moses Moses called all the elder of Israel and told them that I know after departure you gonna leave God so when Israel departed from God a Ministry of Elijah has to be sad but to bring the heart of Israel back to God so Allah is explaining God here that where I am now everybody here in Israel already took your commandment and we know when we introduced Paul when before Paul died which was a type of a modern Moses Paul also called ER and ER and per se that are no aftermath departure there will be grieving whoops that's gonna come up and I will do a scatter destroy their altars churches everybody let's go back and he says I have been jealous for the Lord God of hosts for the children of God have forsaken your covenant thrown down your altars remember altars in the Bible speak of one church a place of worship everybody there so Paul was saying that I know after my departure you going to be departing from the Lord that's why you'd say contend for the faith that was once delivered to the cell that's why Jesus said when the Son of Man will come shall heal firm faith and if you recall in the book of Genesis in the ephesian church age when the filtered Church age came when does though the message open up God said that I have one finger against you Ephesian what happened you have left your first you are ready for second God you've already forsaken your covenant with me are you there and the fusion church changes was the 19 was the first breaking day Elijah's telling garden the first seal already run its course we clear I'm gonna explain it let's go back there and for the children of Israel has forsaken your covenant thrown down your altar and did what so annual profit with the sword what happened when the Antichrist left the first our horse and change to the head rose he ever showed what he was he doing killing the children of what God your second cell was right there now you seed are you there everybody clear he's killed Elijah I went to more horrible but when he goes to more ever he's bringing the scriptures about the seals let's read it your prophet with the sword and I even I only I'm left and they seek my love to take it did God answer him watch what no God tells him verse 11 and he said go forth and Santa ponder in other word I want you to go east go west go to South Atlantic you are inquiring you are bringing the seals here I can see how the Antichrist Jezebel was killing 68 million to other churches but before I open up the revelation you need to go to sunset mountain everybody the scripture was already there but he have to go through the experience well the lines I went there what happened the whirlwind came up there was rock there was fire and everything watch now verse 13 what 13 and he was so when Elijah heard it he rubbed his face in his mantle and went out and stood at the entering of the cave and below they came a voice to him and said what do you hear what Elijah same question they asked him are you there after sunset mountain go back Easter now you can preach this hills everybody clear watch a larger he's gonna repeat the same thing and he said I have been very shadows same word I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts because the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant 12 and you altar and slain your prophet with the sword and I even I am left and the Sigma life to take it Elijah repeat the same thing here that's who I gotta wanna play here to go west to get the blaster and when he got the blaster then he come back and he took the silk then God came for the shield and God told him like I have never bought their knees I he unfolded a revelation he never asked for the doll revelation until the experience of sunset mountain happened first everybody clear everybody clear I hope I didn't lose it buddy everybody here now we came back to where we were last time tired okay what a Maurice you have not given me a signal yet okay now the last time we described this woman which plan everything about the timing that the spirit of Elijah will go to the Delta it will grow in the last church age which is the lower this century that's the church age where the anointing of death is dealing with it that way Elijah approached the woman because the third seal already hit now the fourth is entering to kill the woman that's why Elijah the Prophet appeared to a gentle woman so Elijah must appear in the last year changes when the anointing of death is already in the land what there is a woman double to be rescued everybody else and when the Rajah went there Elijah spoke to the woman and say hey bring me bread bring me water if you notice the woman was living with a natural food everybody she had a natural milk and she also has a cruse of oil everybody else these were natural that's the first food that was provided by the divine blessing of God from heaven either because meal right here was coming from rain and oil also was coming from the rain she already had natural food provided from heaven but when a larger came you follow me a larger spoke the word and that word created the same food but spiritually everybody here Moses have the first commandment of the law then the second one but both of them were still the same the only difference is one was written first by God but the second one Moses have to do some work to it the first food your first bubble you will have it are there but the second food must come from the mouth of Elijah but it's not going to be contradictory to your Bible it's going to be aligned with the food you already that's why the message is perfectly in line with the Bible are you there so they're opening that woman had food hidden a hidden manna because the food of the woman have a secret if she takes up other in the tabernacle in the third in the Holy of Holies there were manna when you take my out it was a hidden food created by the spoken word the third pull a loyalty created food dr. poore anointing was expressed to death Genta are we there the third pull anointing goes to a gentle woman we clear we clear with that then the resurrection was there and we saw already the resurrection with brother Branham now brother Branham says this I know where I'm going to stop there churches are cooling off we just might as well face that the churches are getting worse and worse all the time more preaching is been done than ever in the world and let's practice that's the same thing in a message more preaching get on YouTube see how many sermon we have in lutulu but they practice their life very little more preaching has been done than ever in the world and less practice than ever did in all the world just look like a keep men came coming undaunted of the whole spirit they preach with everything that was within that's within them and the people walk right away as if nothing had ever happened just unconcerned now there he's got to be a reason for that why is he people in a message don't change anymore what is the reason brother Branham and in future studies there is this tells what the reason is do you know the scripture says there will be a time in the last day when they shall be famine I'm going back to the scripture every clear famine struck the land not for bread and everybody here okay not for bread and water but for hearing the Word of God and that men and that men will go from East remember scripture west north and south seeking to read the Word of God and fell to find it just think of the time we are living in and we are living in that time I believe when the prophet amos spoke that he forced so the United States of America so you're Elijah will come from America because it's the only place that on earth would meet that description in this so the spirit of Elijah will go to the Delta well in Europe in Africa in Asia God told Abel's look over there whenever's look he saw the United State and he gave a corded corded description it takes a prophet to decode it and tells you the place Elijah will come will be a man Eureka okay we're gonna stop in those few quotes the Bible say about random say that revelation 10 and according to Malachi food and shall look 22:17 and so forth there is got to come a new fusion everybody remember the lion and their ego the lion health could come back again because the merienda when he comes down he's going to roll like a lion there will be another Ephesian Church angel right there is promising they must come an official that the Sevenfold mysteries of the Word of God must be unfolded and it believes that we are there I believe we are right in the shadow of the coming of the Son of God and as Joshua just before the Ephesian wisdom so did John the Baptist's ways just before the next official and we are promised another another Ephesian is predicted here in the scripture therefore a figure with a living in the Ephesian again we are promised that that word was left of doing the seven churches seven ages and how much more has he promised how much more it is leading in the bubble to this very age we are living the Ephesian again of the church ages we got seven Church ages we are promised that at the loud Eastern Church ages there will be another Ephesian that's right and we are here I believe it I believe we firma heart that Jesus Christ who made the promise so your Elijah is in the last age he is in the age of law Isha where is he coming from from America that's where the scripture bowing to and fro looking for food it is not in Europe so if they tell you malachi for is in europe is false malachi for will come from america when he come from america here is his description it's not going to be in the third seal but in the term when death is in the land when the pair horse is tracking both naturally and spiritually you can see coronavirus and everything going on that anointing is still working but not only is the anointing of death working the anointing of life the Eagle anointing also it is working around gathering the children because sooner we need to go to the rapture let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we thank you again for your grace for your love for your mercy father all these things has been hidden and it took grace to bring them back to you slowly to unfold the Lord father this revelation not Lord father to bring us to a head knowledge but to make us realize determing Lord father and the importance of the revelation and the message you sent to us Lord father it's a troubling time you have permitted this troubling time Lord you know that we need it we needed this pressure we needed to be shaken from our comfort zone Lord to refocus to recalibrate to Lord we examine whether we are in the faith whether we understood what we got into it whether we understood the message that we are believing that we claim to be believing Lord father Lord Jesus Christ you spoke through your prophet that the revelation is a work of the spirit Lord it is not something that a man can bring or unfold to anybody further we can preach the word but it takes the Holy Spirit to give the revelation father may you give the relation may you continue to minister to the heart of your children Lord until Lord father these sermon these series Lord Wilbur flawed father a thirst that's going to drive your children to desperation Lord to examine not somebody else life not somebody else church not what is going on all around the message Lord but to examine our own life to examine our own families to examine our own children to make sure a lot father that we have the token that we are serious we found that we are pair that in anytime father you can come and we will say that we are ready to go Lord because we are tired of this earth Lord father Lord may you minister grace to your children may you strengthen us Lord may you keep us in the center of your word as your prophet stayed a lord father that I got my mind set in this message in the third pool Lord father Mayer mud be always centered to the word Lord may we keep fellowshipping with you and communing with you in the spirit Lord so that you can begin to make love you can begin to express to us you can begin to unfold to us the hidden secret Lord father you spoke that or whatever you did to your messenger Lord was only an example father that go to what you can do to every believer Lord we have received Malachi for father we have accepted this message Lord father we have cherished this message Lord father we have toured both we took on the mantle of Elijah Lord father but now we are facing a critical our Lord where we need the God of Elijah to come down Lord but as your children change our life long consecrate our life Lord bring us more closer unto the Lord so that we might be example to other salt of the earth Lord that can be we begin to bring thirst and work to our co-worker that can begin to bring thirst in the community Lord what other people can see us as a light that is placed Lord father on the hill where we are manifesting Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever father we thank you for everything bless your children Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen god bless you Brad Abel
