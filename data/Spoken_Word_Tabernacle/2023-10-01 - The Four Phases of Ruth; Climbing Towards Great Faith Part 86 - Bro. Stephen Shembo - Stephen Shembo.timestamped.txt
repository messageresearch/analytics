[27:19] your word because we know you will
[27:21] because you have father Lord God
[27:23] remember Lord God the prayers of those
[27:25] in the unspoken uh the invisible
[27:28] audience Lord Jesus Christ the things
[27:30] that they have need of Father for they
[27:32] are those of like Precious faith that
[27:33] gather together with us Lord God you
[27:35] promis to meet all of our needs Lord God
[27:37] father we thank you for the praise
[27:39] reports Lord Jesus Christ it proves that
[27:41] Lord you're giving us prosperity Lord
[27:43] God as your word was unfolded Heavenly

[27:48] Lord God the blessings are unfolding
[27:50] father so this is the third Lord
[27:52] testimony Lord God and request we heard

[52:55] the scripture go through the message of
[52:58] the hour make sure you know what you're
[53:00] talking about amen because I lay the
[53:02] scripture I have not even touched
[53:04] brother Bram now today by God's grace
[53:06] I'm going to start pulling brother Bram
[53:08] and you see what brother brandham say
[53:10] amen amen I know it's going to shake
[53:14] people it might trouble some but I have
[53:17] no choice I don't have a bishop so I
[53:20] have to
[53:21] deliver amen I'm not delivering this to
[53:25] fight no I'm delivering this to help the
[53:28] children of God I have no choice I have
[53:31] to
[53:31] deliver
[53:33] amen Genesis
[53:35] 21:9 if you thereare you can say amen I
[53:38] just want to pick up something here so
[53:40] Genesis 22 makes sense amen amen am
[53:45] verse n and Sarah saw the son of Hagar
[53:49] the Egyptian which he had born to
[53:52] Abraham mocking in other words word
[53:55] ridiculing you might be seated wherefore
[53:59] said uh wherefore she said my pilot is
[54:02] right there sir okay praise
[54:05] God glory to God thank God I didn't
[54:08] deliver my
[54:09] thought last Sunday because I miss
[54:15] you I was like if he was old enough I
[54:19] need to get him married
[54:21] quickly I say when he's old enough
[54:28] so he can stay put a little
[54:30] bit
[54:32] amen amen because he's doing a great
[54:36] job you go home and sit and hear him the
[54:39] way he's going he follows the spirit
[54:42] correctly amen glory to God who knows
[54:47] what is inside
[54:49] there I'm only responsible for what I
[54:51] say that's okay amen
[54:55] that's me amen wherefore she said to
[55:00] Abraham cast out this Bond
[55:04] woman and her son this bondn woman it's
[55:07] no more Hagar this bondn woman and her
[55:10] son for the son of this Bond woman shall
[55:14] not be here with my son even with Isaac
[55:19] precisely amen
[55:21] amen because Abraham had at this point
[55:24] only two
[55:26] children at this point the other
[55:28] children came after Sarah was dead amen
[55:32] so now a circumstance happen at home
[55:36] where they have to remove one of
[55:40] them amen watch verse 11 and the things
[55:44] were very was very
[55:47] Grievous in Abraham sight because of his
[55:51] what son so he was a son of Abraham amen
[55:55] now I'm going to kick my son out because
[55:58] they were having a fight with his
[56:00] brother wow amen amen so Abraham now is
[56:04] going through a painful
[56:08] time amen but the
[56:13] seed cannot
[56:15] haar with the
[56:17] Shar so a separation must
[56:22] happen separation are painful
[56:27] so don't expect separating and you
[56:30] laughing so you're not really separating
[56:33] when you separate and it's painful you
[56:35] know it's
[56:41] working amen and God was in
[56:45] it God was in this
[56:52] scenario right now it looks like it's
[56:54] Sarah who's protecting Isaac and Sarah
[56:58] is coming up with the idea but let's see
[57:00] what's going on amen amen verse 12 and
[57:06] God said to Abraham let it not be
[57:10] Grievous in other word when Abraham was
[57:13] sorrowful God came he said
[57:16] hey what's going
[57:18] on you know what's going on he said
[57:20] chill
[57:23] out slow down
[57:26] yes I'm putting that in plain word so we
[57:30] all understand say slow down what's
[57:32] wrong why you crying like a child s say
[57:35] say
[57:37] that come on this is now God not Sarah
[57:41] he said let it not be Grievous in your
[57:44] sight because of the L and because of
[57:47] your Bond woman in all that Sarah had
[57:51] said not
[57:53] some
[57:55] everything that Sarah
[58:00] said in all that Sarah has said to you
[58:05] you do what
[58:07] hearken hearken to what her
[58:12] voice in other words Sarah is right
[58:14] that's
[58:15] right so what Sarah was saying was the
[58:18] word of God that's why Paul pick it up
[58:22] in the book of uh Roman and Paul quot
[58:28] Sarah amen he say in all that Sarah has
[58:32] said to you hearken to her voice yes sir
[58:36] for in
[58:39] Isaac shall your seed be what called so
[58:45] God open a new promise to Abraham in a
[58:50] painful
[58:51] time amen amen amen Lord I know why I'm
[58:57] saying this sir if you don't if you
[59:00] don't understand this you won't
[59:02] understand Genesis
[59:04] 22 Amen in the painful time the time of
[59:10] distress amen that painful moment amen
[59:15] God
[59:17] revealed something to Abraham about
[59:23] Isaac
[59:25] amen he says through
[59:28] Isaac your seed will
[59:31] come in PL word Isaac will have
[59:38] children you didn't get it God is
[59:41] telling Abraham that you see Isaac yes
[59:44] Isaac won't die that's
[59:48] right that now now now we start
[59:51] getting in Isaac was a child
[59:55] a child cannot have a
[59:57] baby to have a baby he need to grow in
[1:00:00] other word Isaac need to grow and have a
[1:00:03] baby and when he have children through
[1:00:06] those children I will bring the Messiah
[1:00:09] there
[1:00:12] am so God lock himself
[1:00:18] up God put himself in
[1:00:23] trouble because Abraham now is going to
[1:00:25] use
[1:00:26] that against
[1:00:30] God are we together yes sir are we
[1:00:33] together so according to this place God
[1:00:36] is telling Abraham Abraham Isaac will
[1:00:39] have
[1:00:41] children and Isaac had children he had
[1:00:45] Esau and Jacob so there is nothing that
[1:00:48] can bother Isaac if he has not have a
[1:00:52] child
[1:00:53] yet
[1:00:57] are we together are we together so what
[1:01:00] seems to be a painful
[1:01:02] Experience open up a greater
[1:01:07] Revelation what seems to be a hard trial
[1:01:10] for job it is open up something about
[1:01:15] the
[1:01:18] resurrection are we together are we
[1:01:22] together in here
[1:01:25] A promise is given about Isaac having
[1:01:28] the children and through his genealogy
[1:01:31] will come the seed which is Christ
[1:01:35] amen amen let's go now to Genesis 22 so
[1:01:39] you understand now two things happen
[1:01:42] number one they have to
[1:01:45] separate Ishmael
[1:01:48] out he has to leave the seed cannot be
[1:01:51] here with the Shar they have to separate
[1:01:53] them after the separation a promise was
[1:01:56] given now watch now Genesis 22 Genesis
[1:02:01] 22:1 and he came to pass after what
[1:02:05] these things you understand these things
[1:02:07] now now you begin to understand these
[1:02:09] things if you don't read it you don't
[1:02:12] understand what really
[1:02:13] happened and it came to pass after these
[1:02:16] things that God did what tempt Abraham
[1:02:20] how can God tempt
[1:02:22] somebody come on brother
[1:02:26] the Bible say God doesn't tempt people
[1:02:29] that's what the Bible says this
[1:02:31] temptation is not the temptation of
[1:02:34] James that's right that's exactly right
[1:02:37] brother the temptation of James is a
[1:02:40] Temptation toward doing something wrong
[1:02:42] corre toward the last that's why James
[1:02:45] say everybody's is uh is tempted
[1:02:48] according to the last that's right but
[1:02:50] God was not tempting Abraham to do
[1:02:52] something
[1:02:53] wrong
[1:02:55] are we together glory to God he says and
[1:02:59] God did tempt Abraham and say to him
[1:03:04] Abraham and he say behold here I am way
[1:03:08] can pay attention Budd amen and he said
[1:03:12] take now your
[1:03:15] son your only son
[1:03:19] ISAC whom you love for the first time
[1:03:24] in the history God is requiring a human
[1:03:30] sacrifice
[1:03:32] amen
[1:03:34] please do you have your
[1:03:41] Bible oh God for the first time in the
[1:03:44] history God want a human
[1:03:48] sacrifice
[1:03:49] sir and the human sacrifice is a child
[1:03:53] only child of a
[1:03:56] man what is he talking
[1:04:00] about we clear listen he says and he
[1:04:03] says take now your son your only son who
[1:04:08] Isaac whom you love so this son God
[1:04:13] already seen the love that Abraham have
[1:04:16] toward Isaac remember Abraham is already
[1:04:20] deprive of Ishmael and he grieve him so
[1:04:26] hard now they they already remov Ishmael
[1:04:30] Ishmael is gone okay no problem he's
[1:04:33] probably the son of a born woman that's

[1:13:27] Isaac will be

[1:13:44] listen to this follow me carefully if I
[1:13:47] can even cross this I will be
[1:13:50] good the Bible say this is Paul in
[1:13:53] Hebrew 11 Paul Say by what faith so
[1:13:57] Abraham was doing things by what
[1:14:01] faith now you begin to understand that
[1:14:04] Abraham was not just talking like that
[1:14:06] he was talking by what
[1:14:09] faith faith in
[1:14:11] what because faith faith must have a
[1:14:15] foundation follow correctly he say by
[1:14:18] faith Abraham when he was what Tri Paul
[1:14:22] didn't use the word
[1:14:29] tempted what is Paul saying Tri did you
[1:14:32] see Paul saying tempted no so that
[1:14:35] Temptation was a
[1:14:38] trial that's it that's it are we
[1:14:41] together yes sir if you go with me like
[1:14:45] this we would take too long what up
[1:14:49] amen what they call tempting was
[1:14:52] actually
[1:14:54] trial amen he says Abraham when he was
[1:15:00] tried no
[1:15:01] tempted amen offer up Isaac and he that
[1:15:08] received the promises offer up his only
[1:15:11] what begotten son do you hear that
[1:15:14] terminology the only begotten son that's
[1:15:16] right does he say
[1:15:19] something it's talking about who Christ
[1:15:23] Abraham took the wood and put it on
[1:15:25] Isaac because Jesus Christ will carry
[1:15:28] [Applause]
[1:15:35] water brother Bram say when they put the
[1:15:38] wood on Isaac he was speaking about
[1:15:40] Jesus carrying the cross because the
[1:15:43] cross is a wood so do you see what is
[1:15:48] happening everybody okay everybody good
[1:15:52] Hallelujah
[1:15:56] everybody
[1:15:57] good Verse 18 watch now watch clearly
[1:16:03] Abraham had a faith because of that
[1:16:06] Faith Abraham was not afraid to offer up
[1:16:09] Isaac amen what was in the mind of
[1:16:12] Abraham what produced that
[1:16:16] Faith because because when Abraham say
[1:16:20] me and the Lord we are going and come
[1:16:22] back Abraham was speaking by faith what
[1:16:26] was the generator of that Faith this is
[1:16:29] what Paul is explaining follow me
[1:16:32] carefully Verse 18 of whom he was what
[1:16:36] said that in what Isaac shall that seed
[1:16:40] be what
[1:16:41] called so when God told Abraham kill
[1:16:44] Isaac Abraham said wait a
[1:16:48] minute recently he told
[1:16:52] me
[1:16:54] that in Isaac Isaac will have
[1:16:58] children but Isaac is not grown
[1:17:02] enough and he want to kill him oh no
[1:17:05] problem take Isaac let me see how you
[1:17:07] going to kill
[1:17:09] him in other word if your purpose is to
[1:17:13] kill Isaac you must raise him back
[1:17:16] [Applause]
[1:17:17] again because what you told me yesterday
[1:17:21] is going to be a lie but God it's
[1:17:24] impossible for God to
[1:17:28] lie when you dealing with God catch him
[1:17:31] by what he
[1:17:33] [Applause]
[1:17:39] says don't be wasting your time in
[1:17:42] prayer talking talking talking you talk
[1:17:46] with
[1:17:48] [Applause]
[1:17:49] Precision you get him you say do you
[1:17:51] remember what you say here
[1:17:53] this is it do you remember what you say
[1:17:55] here this is it do you remember what you
[1:17:57] say here in other word you are pushing
[1:18:00] God
[1:18:02] back you push him back you push him back
[1:18:05] you push him back you until God is at
[1:18:08] the
[1:18:10] corner you put God to the
[1:18:12] [Applause]
[1:18:14] corner
[1:18:16] Hall word
[1:18:19] word
[1:18:21] hallelujah
[1:18:23] watch
[1:18:28] this the faith of Abraham here at Point
[1:18:33] a is based on the
[1:18:38] promise the promise that was given to
[1:18:40] Abraham that Isaac will not die without
[1:18:44] a
[1:18:45] baby the promise about Isaac producing
[1:18:49] the
[1:18:50] seed so Abraham had something to lock
[1:18:54] God when Abraham look he say oh don't
[1:18:58] worry let's go let me see him kill you
[1:19:02] but there is one thing after he finish
[1:19:05] killing after after I cut your throat I
[1:19:08] would turn around that say this child
[1:19:10] need to have a baby he need to be
[1:19:13] married so you I'm going to say in my
[1:19:17] word I'm going to say my way you telling
[1:19:20] God you better you better
[1:19:24] [Applause]

[1:21:05] need to be gracious with
[1:21:08] me I have not start preaching I'm just
[1:21:11] reading the scripture this is how I read
[1:21:14] my
[1:21:16] Bible verse
[1:21:19] 19 accounting that God was able to what
[1:21:23] raise him up do you see why Abraham was
[1:21:25] thinking about it because God gave me
[1:21:28] the promise amen God gave me the promise
[1:21:32] that's why I know God will raise him up
[1:21:34] that's why Abraham said they chared me
[1:21:37] wel come
[1:21:39] back because God gave me the promise he
[1:21:42] said accounting that God was able to
[1:21:45] raise him up even from the what the dead
[1:21:48] do you see what was in the mind of
[1:21:50] Abraham the promise trck him and say oh
[1:21:53] Isaac will have a baby don't worry Isaac
[1:21:56] won't die God will raise him up watch
[1:21:58] the second gear Abraham used amen watch
[1:22:02] it he said from W
[1:22:06] also he receive him in a what figure
[1:22:11] that's I want you to follow me
[1:22:14] carefully the first thing uh Abraham
[1:22:18] used Amen to give him strength in this
[1:22:22] triy
[1:22:23] he used the promise of
[1:22:25] God Amen the second thing Abraham
[1:22:30] used Abraham used his
[1:22:35] [Applause]
[1:22:39] experience when I tell you keep up with
[1:22:41] the sermon I know what I'm talking about
[1:22:44] experience give you bread for the moment
[1:22:47] and he give you the bullet for the
[1:22:51] future the god that deliver me from The
[1:22:53] Lion past from the bear past this are
[1:22:57] ccum stand for the
[1:22:59] [Applause]
[1:23:02] present are we together are we together
[1:23:05] so the second thing Abraham is using
[1:23:08] Abraham is using his
[1:23:12] experience his past experience what was
[1:23:15] the past experience Paul is saying that
[1:23:19] from W also he did what received him in
[1:23:22] a figure he receive him him who he
[1:23:25] receive Isaac in a
[1:23:28] figure listen to me carefully we
[1:23:32] clear listen to Paul follow me carefully
[1:23:37] don't look at the verse on the top go to
[1:23:40] 19 you ready being not weak in what
[1:23:45] faith he considered not his own
[1:23:50] body his own body body how now dead so
[1:23:54] Abraham was how dead I want you to
[1:23:58] follow
[1:24:00] me Abraham in his body
[1:24:06] dead but Abraham was married to have a
[1:24:10] baby you need a daddy and the mommy the
[1:24:12] daddy is declared dead we need to for
[1:24:15] watch mama if Mama was still
[1:24:18] alive you ready for me you ready he con
[1:24:22] not his own body how now dead when he
[1:24:25] was 100 years old nether yet the what
[1:24:29] deadness of of who Sarah W so Daddy was
[1:24:32] how de mama was how
[1:24:36] dead I love this
[1:24:39] church mama was also
[1:24:43] dead everybody okay so Abraham
[1:24:48] remembered that this boy Isaac receive
[1:24:53] him as somebody from the
[1:24:57] [Applause]
[1:25:03] dead in other word do you follow me do
[1:25:07] you follow me in other word because
[1:25:10] Abraham was dead Sarah was dead it was
[1:25:14] impossible for both of them to have a
[1:25:16] baby so God have to resurrect
[1:25:21] Abraham
[1:25:24] do you follow me God have to change
[1:25:27] Abraham and Sarah back again to be
[1:25:31] younger in order to receive the child so
[1:25:35] Isaac was a product of the
[1:25:39] [Applause]
[1:25:42] Resurrection hallu
[1:25:45] hallu can I drop something you will
[1:25:48] swallow it are you sure you will swallow
[1:25:50] it if Isaac was the first begotten of
[1:25:55] Abraham from the
[1:25:56] [Applause]
[1:26:04] dead so when when Abraham died and
[1:26:09] resurrected the first begotten from the
[1:26:11] dead was
[1:26:13] [Applause]
[1:26:19] Isaac are we together are we together
[1:26:22] so when the trial came Abraham stop and
[1:26:26] say wait a minute this boy the way I
[1:26:30] receive him I receive him as somebody
[1:26:34] who was dead and Was Made Alive that's
[1:26:37] why I receive him to begin with and
[1:26:40] number two recently God told me this boy
[1:26:44] will have
[1:26:47] baby sir so Abraham has two feet now yes
[1:26:51] sir of
[1:26:53] he said you know what me and the child

[1:27:11] will have
[1:27:17] children everybody okay everybody good

[1:30:41] day we need to step beyond the third
[1:30:50] day
[1:30:53] the faith of Paul is good we can hold on
[1:30:56] to the promise we can bring
[1:30:59] Resurrection but there is
[1:31:01] [Applause]
[1:31:11] more Have I Lost somebody hold me tight
[1:31:14] my
[1:31:16] friend everybody good I'm still turning
[1:31:19] the
[1:31:20] corner
[1:31:22] W in other
[1:31:25] word can I continue Abraham has two Gars
[1:31:29] of
[1:31:35] faith in the first gear of faith of
[1:31:38] Abraham he can use his past experience
[1:31:42] and he locks God or he can take a
[1:31:45] promise of God and he lcks
[1:31:49] God but this temp a God wanted to bring
[1:31:54] the true Abraham
[1:32:00] out we clear are we together are we
[1:32:05] together let's go to verse six father
[1:32:08] help me you need to be gracious to me
[1:32:11] I'm just reading the
[1:32:12] Bible verse 6 and Abraham took the wood
[1:32:16] of the burn offering and did what laid
[1:32:18] it upon Isaac he put the cross on Isaac
[1:32:21] and he took the what the fire judgment
[1:32:25] in his hand that's verse six and a knife
[1:32:27] I don't want to get into those detail
[1:32:29] because all of that have meaning I'm
[1:32:31] trying to stay away because if I dig in
[1:32:33] the detail we lost we're going to lose
[1:32:36] our GPS right here because Abraham is a
[1:32:38] prophet the prophet is pushing the son
[1:32:41] toward the cross I'm I'm leaving that
[1:32:44] alone there is more stuff in here let's
[1:32:47] let's stay on the highway okay there is
[1:32:49] too many Billboard so let me stay on the
[1:32:52] highway
[1:32:54] amen but uh uh verse uh n and they went
[1:32:59] both of them together so at this point
[1:33:03] Abraham and Isaac are going along the
[1:33:06] servant are
[1:33:08] behind the servant heard the faith of
[1:33:15] Abraham let me drop
[1:33:17] this the servant and Abraham heard the
[1:33:21] same
[1:33:26] to preach about the resurrection all of
[1:33:29] us can preach
[1:33:30] [Music]
[1:33:33] it to hold on to the promise of God
[1:33:36] everybody can do that there is no
[1:33:39] difference the difference is beyond
[1:33:42] [Applause]
[1:33:44] that Pentecost can pray for the
[1:33:48] sick and they will get result that's
[1:33:51] that's not the problem let's go beyond
[1:33:53] that can I continue now watch verse
[1:33:57] seven and Isaac spoke to Abraham this is
[1:34:00] the first time we hear the voice of
[1:34:02] Isaac sir his father and say my
[1:34:06] father now remember he's included as a
[1:34:09] worshipper Abraham has his sacrifice he
[1:34:13] sacrific is Isaac but Isaac is looking
[1:34:15] me and my father we are going to worship
[1:34:17] but where is the sacrifice so Isaac
[1:34:19] doesn't have a sacrifice amen but
[1:34:21] Abraham has a
[1:34:23] sacrifice are we together Abraham
[1:34:26] sacrifices Isaac but Isaac doesn't know
[1:34:28] he's a sacrifice so he need a sacrifice
[1:34:31] because he is a
[1:34:34] worshiper are we together have I lost
[1:34:37] you you want me to repeat
[1:34:41] again Isaac is a worshiper the will go
[1:34:46] to worship a worshiper must have a
[1:34:49] sacrifice Abraham in his mind he knows
[1:34:52] what the sacrifice is the sacrifice is
[1:34:54] Isaac but Isaac as a worshiper need a
[1:35:02] sacrifice so what Abraham spoke trigger
[1:35:08] something can I continue and Isaac verse
[1:35:12] S spoke to Abraham his father and said
[1:35:15] my father and he said here I am just
[1:35:18] like God called Abraham my son and he
[1:35:21] said behold the what the fire and the
[1:35:23] water the wood but where is the Lamb for
[1:35:28] a burnt what
[1:35:31] offering Abraham now have just finished
[1:35:35] his
[1:35:36] faith he laid his faith down he says the
[1:35:40] lad and me will come down and Paul told
[1:35:44] us that the way he laid that faith is
[1:35:46] that God gave me a promise and God also
[1:35:49] delivered me so everything is okay so
[1:35:52] now Abraham is resting on that Faith to
[1:35:56] move toward the mountain now Isaac
[1:35:58] squeeze Abraham
[1:36:00] [Applause]
[1:36:02] again Abraham say now boy what else can
[1:36:06] I produce again
[1:36:10] [Music]
[1:36:11] here in other words I already have faith
[1:36:14] to handle this deal the deal is me and
[1:36:17] you will go but you won't die my son if
[1:36:19] you die God will raise you up we coming
[1:36:21] back that's it let's go stay quiet God
[1:36:25] says no God pull Isaac he said push
[1:36:28] something on Abraham because Abraham
[1:36:31] need to use the second
[1:36:35] gear are we together are we together
[1:36:39] watch now verse eight and Abraham said
[1:36:42] my son God will do what provide himself
[1:36:45] a lamb for what a burnt offering so they
[1:36:48] went both to both of them how together
[1:36:54] God will provide himself a lamb was a
[1:36:58] lamb there when you say God will provide
[1:37:02] it means something is not
[1:37:04] there is everybody okay so in this Faith
[1:37:09] Abraham begin to
[1:37:13] call things that do not
[1:37:17] exist sir yes sir hallah
[1:37:25] [Music]
[1:37:27] everybody good everybody good everybody
[1:37:31] good the second gear of Abraham is
[1:37:35] Abraham when you push him too hard he
[1:37:38] will begin to call
[1:37:43] [Applause]
[1:37:50] things
[1:37:52] [Music]
[1:37:53] everybody good everybody good have I
[1:37:56] lost anyone so the second gear be of
[1:38:01] Abraham is calling
[1:38:04] things that are not that do not
[1:38:12] exist everybody clear into
[1:38:20] existence
[1:38:23] amen hallelujah do you follow me so
[1:38:27] depending on which pressure come on
[1:38:31] Abraham if it's another pressure he can
[1:38:34] use the promise of God and he get by
[1:38:37] with it if it's another pressure he can
[1:38:40] push his experience using the bullet
[1:38:42] again but if you squeeze Abraham too
[1:38:47] much Abraham will be God
[1:38:51] [Music]
[1:38:52] [Applause]
[1:38:54] do you follow me do you follow me this
[1:38:58] type of faith that that come up in this
[1:39:02] area is a faith that works good with
[1:39:06] [Applause]
[1:39:09] pressure in other word when you bring
[1:39:12] pressure in that faith it is like
[1:39:15] fuel it's a great ingredient it makes
[1:39:19] that Faith work quickly
[1:39:21] that's why brother Bram say wait for the
[1:39:24] pressure of the ecal move and watch the
[1:39:30] [Applause]
[1:39:36] third so when Rome is squeezing
[1:39:39] squeezing it is just pushing you to a

[1:40:34] the second gear then and cth those
[1:40:37] things which be as not as though they
[1:40:40] were do you see that Abraham can use the
[1:40:45] quickening power of God or he can call

[1:40:54] him are we together are we
[1:40:58] together are we together are we together
[1:41:02] so your trial is not really a
[1:41:07] [Applause]
[1:41:10] [Music]
[1:41:12] trial I don't know if I Will preaching
[1:41:15] Hallelujah 1 Corinthians
[1:41:18] 10:3 the Bible says what Paul there has
[1:41:21] no what temptation taken you but such as
[1:41:24] is what Comming to man but God is how
[1:41:28] faithful who will not suffer you to be
[1:41:31] tempted above that ye are what
[1:41:36] able follow me carefully but will with
[1:41:42] the what Temptation in other word when
[1:41:44] God bring a temptation to you God put
[1:41:48] something to that Temptation yes sir
[1:41:55] are we reading the same Bible with the
[1:41:58] Temptation he does what also make a way
[1:42:01] to escape that what may be able to Bear
[1:42:05] it so when God bring a trial to you that
[1:42:08] trial cannot come without a way of
[1:42:12] [Applause]

[1:42:29] lock you up the trial when he comes he
[1:42:34] comes with pressure but if you look in
[1:42:36] that pressure you will see a door wide

[2:11:27] spirit and wherever he takes him he
[2:11:30] tears him and for and he form and Nash
[2:11:33] with his Thief epilepsy and P away amen
[2:11:38] and I spoke to your
[2:11:40] disciple that they should cast him out
[2:11:44] and they could
[2:11:45] not he answer him
[2:11:48] and said oh what faithless
[2:11:53] generation a generation no faith but
[2:11:57] what is the
[2:11:59] solution amen he says how long shall I
[2:12:03] be with you how long shall I suffer you
[2:12:06] bring him who unto me so he's moving
[2:12:11] from the one that doesn't have faith to
[2:12:13] the one that have faith the Bible says
[2:12:16] and they brought him to and they brought
[2:12:19] him to him and when he saw him
[2:12:22] immediately the spirit tore him and he
[2:12:24] felt on he fell on the ground and wallow
[2:12:27] form him and he asked his father how
[2:12:30] long is it ago since this came to him
[2:12:35] and he said of a child he started when
[2:12:38] he was a child and often he has cast him
[2:12:41] into the fire and into the waters to
[2:12:43] destroy him but if you can do anything
[2:12:47] have compassion on us and do what help
[2:12:50] us are we clear people without faith
[2:12:54] Jesus said to him if you can
[2:12:57] believe you there all things are
[2:13:00] possible to him that do what believe it
[2:13:03] Jesus told the man I can do it but to do
[2:13:07] it I need your
[2:13:08] faith that's it amen I'm reading the
[2:13:12] Bible I'm I'm ready to do it I'm more
[2:13:15] than able to do it but in order to
[2:13:17] dispatch the power from me into your
[2:13:20] solution or your problem I need
[2:13:23] [Music]
[2:13:24] Faith amen this man look at him Jesus
[2:13:28] already said they don't have faith what
[2:13:31] do you do you there verse 21 im 24 and
[2:13:36] immediately the father of the child did
[2:13:38] what cried out and say with what tears
[2:13:42] Lord what I believe do what help thou my
[2:13:46] unbelief
[2:13:49] so even if you don't have
[2:13:53] faith even if you don't have faith God
[2:13:56] is there to help your faith
[2:14:00] up I'm reading the Bible Jesus told them
[2:14:03] generation with our faith Jesus say if
[2:14:06] you want me to do this you need to have
[2:14:08] faith the man pray he say father I am
[2:14:11] believing but I want you to help my
[2:14:14] unbelief in other word even if there is
[2:14:18] not faith if you are willing for God to
[2:14:21] help you God will help you have
[2:14:25] faith and this child was
[2:14:29] delivered everybody okay so without
[2:14:32] faith means there is unbelief
[2:14:38] there everybody clear let's go to the
[2:14:41] Book of
[2:14:42] John glory to God John chapter

[2:24:58] continue father help me he says the
[2:25:01] Apostle say to the Lord increase our
[2:25:05] faith and the Lord
[2:25:11] [Applause]
[2:25:12] say the way they were they were
[2:25:15] expecting they were expecting Jesus to
[2:25:17] say oh wait a
[2:25:21] minute Thomas which level
[2:25:26] two
[2:25:28] Peter this one Jesus didn't do
[2:25:33] that and if you notice Jesus doesn't
[2:25:36] answer the
[2:25:38] question Jesus begin to say
[2:25:42] something verse six and the Lord say if
[2:25:47] you had Faith as a grain of what Mustard
[2:25:52] Seed we already know our faith is
[2:25:56] little this is not what we ask you what
[2:26:00] we ask you is take our faith pushes up
[2:26:03] you begin to tell us what our faith
[2:26:09] is now Jesus goes instead of saying yes
[2:26:14] when you receive this I'm going to
[2:26:15] increase your faith tomorrow I'm going
[2:26:17] to increase your faith Jesus doesn't say
[2:26:19] that Jesus turn and begin to say
[2:26:22] something what is Jesus saying Jesus say
[2:26:25] that if you have a faith as what a
[2:26:28] mustard
[2:26:34] seed what is this
[2:26:37] meaning what does it
[2:26:39] mean tighten up if you have faith as a
[2:26:45] grain of Master seed
[2:26:47] you must
[2:26:50] say to this siot tree be you plugged up
[2:26:55] by the root and be you planted in the
[2:26:58] sea and he should do what obey
[2:27:01] you remember Peter with a load of Faith
[2:27:05] walk in the
[2:27:08] water and Jesus also walk in the water
[2:27:12] but Jesus and Peter have different
[2:27:15] Faith but Peter they walk inward you
[2:27:18] following me Jesus is saying if you have
[2:27:22] a faith like this mastered seed you can
[2:27:27] say to something move and do this and
[2:27:32] it's going to happen in other words you
[2:27:34] can speak the
[2:27:37] word ah brother
[2:27:41] stepen I thought speaking the word you
[2:27:43] need to have a big great faith
[2:27:47] before we move
[2:27:49] forward we need to know what is a
[2:27:51] mastered
[2:27:52] seat let's go to Matthew
[2:27:57] 17 Lord help me if you there you can say
[2:28:01] Amen Matthew 17 verse
[2:28:06] 21 let's get this you
[2:28:15] there
[2:28:18] verse 20 and verse 20 uh verse 20 I'm
[2:28:22] sorry you
[2:28:23] there Matthew chapter 17 verse 20 you
[2:28:27] there the Bible say Jesus said to them
[2:28:32] because of your what unbelief for verily
[2:28:35] I say to you if you have what faith as a
[2:28:39] grain of what mustard seed you shall say
[2:28:42] to this
[2:28:45] mountain
[2:28:48] speak to the
[2:28:50] mountain for a mustard seed to this
[2:28:54] mountain remove here to Yonder place and
[2:28:59] it shall in it shall remove and
[2:29:02] nothing shall be impossible what unto
[2:29:06] you if your faith is like a grain of
[2:29:10] mustard nothing will be impossible to
[2:29:13] you nothing impossible if your faith is
[2:29:17] like a little Mustard
[2:29:20] Seed so why do we need great faith
[2:29:24] then if little faith can do
[2:29:27] everything why do we need great faith
[2:29:30] let's go to Matthew
[2:29:32] 13 and I'm going to see where I'm going
[2:29:34] to go Matthew
[2:29:36] 13:31 follow me carefully now if I can
[2:29:40] clam this amen you there another Parable
[2:29:46] put he forth to them saying the kingdom
[2:29:49] of what heaven is like to a grain of
[2:29:53] what
[2:29:58] mustard
[2:30:00] come which a man did what took and do
[2:30:04] what sold in his
[2:30:06] field we need to know what a master seed
[2:30:09] is now Backle up my friend verse 32
[2:30:13] which indeed is the what least of all
[2:30:17] seeds
[2:30:18] stop so a mastered seed is the smallest
[2:30:23] of every
[2:30:24] seed According To Jesus Christ I'm using
[2:30:27] the Bible
[2:30:28] Hallelujah so when they ask Jesus
[2:30:31] increase our faith Jesus look at them he
[2:30:35] went to the smallest of all
[2:30:38] Faith he said you see the little little
[2:30:40] little little little little the kinding
[2:30:42] of garden Faith you see this kinding of
[2:30:44] garden faith if you have this kinding of
[2:30:46] garden faith is you see that mountain
[2:30:49] you with a kindergarten faith can move
[2:30:51] that
[2:30:52] mountain let's go slowly so a master
[2:30:56] seed is the
[2:30:59] smallest of all
[2:31:02] seed this is Jesus himself
[2:31:06] explaining in red verse 32 which indeed
[2:31:11] is the least of all seed Kama
[2:31:15] but
[2:31:17] when it is what
[2:31:19] grown so the master seed does remain
[2:31:23] Master
[2:31:28] seed church are we together if you tired
[2:31:31] I stop they asked Jesus increase our
[2:31:35] faith Jesus went to the
[2:31:38] elementary he went to
[2:31:41] kindergarden he say if you have a Faith
[2:31:44] Like a What mastery and Jesus now is
[2:31:47] explaining that a master seed is first
[2:31:49] of all the smallest of the faith but
[2:31:53] when you put it it doesn't stay
[2:31:58] small that faith will
[2:32:00] [Applause]
[2:32:07] grow everybody okay one makes a tree
[2:32:14] grow hallu come on what makes a tree
[2:32:17] grow
[2:32:18] water so if the faith is already there
[2:32:22] and the watching of the word bite the
[2:32:31] word the Bible say the washing of the
[2:32:33] word b the what word so if the word is
[2:32:37] continuing to come on the master seed
[2:32:40] the master seed won't Remain the
[2:32:42] smallest seed it will begin to do what
[2:32:45] grow
[2:32:47] that's why brother Steven say read the
[2:32:49] Cod read the church ages read the seals
[2:32:53] read the 70 weeks of Daniel put your
[2:32:55] head in the master because your faith
[2:32:58] need to
[2:33:00] [Applause]
[2:33:02] grow are we together are we together
[2:33:06] follow me he says oh God help
[2:33:11] me when he will begin to grow
[2:33:17] amen he says when it begin to grow it is
[2:33:21] grown K it is the what
[2:33:27] greatest thank you Lord
[2:33:31] am when he start he was a
[2:33:35] what the word Jesus used smallest but
[2:33:40] when he grow it is the what greatest so
[2:33:43] the great is already in the small
[2:33:55] can I continue can I continue if I begin
[2:33:58] to pull brother Bram now it's a problem
[2:34:01] everybody okay he says and when he goes
[2:34:05] he becomes the what greatest among her
[2:34:07] so he mov from the smallest to the
[2:34:10] whoever is praying for me to stop don't
[2:34:12] worry I'm going to stop your prayer will
[2:34:14] be answered soon
[2:34:19] everybody
[2:34:20] okay everybody okay he
[2:34:24] says he says it is the greatest among
[2:34:27] what hers and become a what
[2:34:33] tree when it's the greatest it becomes a
[2:34:37] tree amen it become a tree come so that
[2:34:43] the what birds of the air come and do
[2:34:46] what large in the branches
[2:34:50] [Music]
[2:34:51] thereof I'm going to drop this because I
[2:34:53] don't have time if you go to the Book of
[2:35:00] Daniel nebuchad had a dream of a big
[2:35:04] tree with bird and everything on it and
[2:35:08] God gave the interpretation that it's
[2:35:10] the greatness of the kingdom of
[2:35:13] Nebuchadnezzar which was a golden
[2:35:15] Kingdom
[2:35:19] everybody okay everybody okay and then
[2:35:21] the Beast and everything can come under
[2:35:24] it so that faith that you want to
[2:35:26] increase instead of Jesus telling them
[2:35:29] that hey here is the key get the key
[2:35:31] crank up you thereare Jesus said no no
[2:35:33] no no no no if you have a Faith Like a
[2:35:37] What because every faith comes from
[2:35:41] God no matter how leader it is every
[2:35:45] faith come from God so God cannot ignore
[2:35:49] your faith no matter how little it
[2:35:55] is amen my God I don't know how this
[2:35:59] kept
[2:36:01] moving here it is Hebrew 12:2 the Bible
[2:36:05] say looking unto who Jesus the what
[2:36:08] author and and the Finish he's the
[2:36:12] author and the what finisher so the one
[2:36:15] who the faith that you have is Jesus so
[2:36:18] there is no way Jesus can be lead
[2:36:22] anybody's
[2:36:24] Faith because Faith come from him the
[2:36:28] Bible say faith is a gift of God in
[2:36:31] Ephesians 28 the Bible say faith cometh
[2:36:34] by what hearing hearing what the word so
[2:36:37] the word of God produce Faith so no
[2:36:40] matter which level you are God is there
[2:36:43] to pick you
[2:36:44] up
[2:36:48] everybody okay everybody okay but to
[2:36:51] grow all you need to do is the lot of
[2:36:54] faith that you have there Jesus said if
[2:36:56] you put it on the ground you continue to
[2:36:59] water it that faith will begin to grow
[2:37:03] when he grow he become a greatest of all
[2:37:06] herb until even the bird begin to come
[2:37:09] and then sit on it what used to be big
[2:37:13] like this one day we'll become a big J
[2:37:20] everybody okay everybody okay so far
[2:37:23] everybody good everybody good listen to
[2:37:27] what brother brandham say then I have to

[2:37:49] of that I didn't give you any quote now
[2:37:51] brother Bram is speaking the authoriz
[2:37:54] mouth peace of God for this age now he's
[2:37:57] talking and when he talk I say amen
[2:38:02] amen some people has great big Faith
[2:38:05] like what this anything can what happen
[2:38:08] the next has a faith that deep it takes
[2:38:12] a little
[2:38:14] longer

[2:38:20] little
[2:38:22] while some has Faith Like a What Mustard
[2:38:26] Seed but if it's Master Seed
[2:38:30] Faith let's go my brother genuine Faith

[2:38:38] it I'm picking you up where you are my
[2:38:41] friend hold on to it just keep watching
[2:38:46] believing it it shall become a what
[2:38:48] marble Faith then it will become a what
[2:38:51] grapefruit fa then it will become what
[2:38:53] mountain faith it shall bring you right
[2:38:56] out uh-huh just the same with it

[2:39:47] discouraged and do not believe what
[2:39:49] symptom symptom that is what the devil's
[2:39:53] [Applause]
[2:40:04] lie so what I'm saying is when they pray
[2:40:07] for you and if your faith is not where
[2:40:11] it's supposed to be it doesn't mean you
[2:40:13] don't have faith because if you come for
[2:40:16] prayer it means you already have faith
[2:40:19] but your faith might not be where it's
[2:40:21] supposed to be but hold on to that
[2:40:26] M continue to believe continue to
[2:40:30] believe continue to believe as it's
[2:40:33] growing up brother Bram say watch out
[2:40:35] for symptoms because symptom want to
[2:40:39] discourage you because you don't have
[2:40:41] the result yet but if you focus on the
[2:40:44] faith the the seed will grow he will
[2:40:47] take care of your
[2:40:50] [Applause]
[2:40:52] problem I'm almost there my friend

[2:40:58] she has to do is to do what accept it
[2:41:00] according to her what faith it shall be
[2:41:03] to her if she believe how spontaneously
[2:41:07] right now great faith over what her head
[2:41:10] she can she shall go right on be what
[2:41:13] healed here if she believe that much he
[2:41:17] might take her what two or what few
[2:41:20] weeks to get
[2:41:24] well I am helping you my friend because
[2:41:28] we want if we be praying for something
[2:41:31] happen even if it doesn't happen it
[2:41:34] could be according to your faith it
[2:41:36] doesn't mean you don't have faith you
[2:41:38] need to know how to fight the devil even
[2:41:41] if I'm going home but the symptom is
[2:41:44] still there I have faith and I'm going
[2:41:47] to hold on the faith that they pray for
[2:41:50] [Applause]
[2:41:54] me I'm going this way until the spoken
[2:41:58] until we reach the spoken
[2:42:00] word brother Bram say it might take two
[2:42:03] or few weeks to get well if she's done
[2:42:06] to a what Mustard Seed if she just have
[2:42:09] that kind of Faith do what hold on to it
[2:42:12] it shall bring you right out of the
[2:42:14] light just stay with it believe it and
[2:42:19] do what testify of and do what confess
[2:42:23] [Music]
[2:42:24] [Applause]
[2:42:32] it let me go let's start again if you
[2:42:36] have a master seed Fai in other word if
[2:42:39] you are the lowest in this church in
[2:42:41] faith if you have faithless like Thomas
[2:42:44] God will crank you
[2:42:45] if you are the lowest in faith in this
[2:42:47] church don't worry brother Bram is
[2:42:51] giving us how to make the master seed
[2:42:55] grow what do you do to the master seed
[2:42:58] believe it and do what testify of it and
[2:43:01] do what confess it and God will do what

[2:52:20] be but he will be just as certain as I'm
[2:52:24] standing here he will
[2:52:26] be get this and that's say the little
[2:52:30] boy that had that little lunch he had
[2:52:34] was not very much in his hand but when
[2:52:39] he let what he had go into Jesus hand he
[2:52:43] fed what thousands and maybe what Le the
[2:52:47] faith you had you say well I wish I had
[2:52:50] great fath but what Le the faith you got
[2:52:54] you got faith enough to come to

[2:53:05] morning how many people came to church
[2:53:08] this morning brother Bram say you had

[2:53:18] people if you got that much Faith he say
[2:53:21] you got faith enough to come to church
[2:53:23] and then if you got that much Faith why
[2:53:27] don't you just give it over into the
[2:53:30] hand of Jesus and he shall feed
[2:53:34] thousands there is no much in your hand
[2:53:37] but once in his hand then he shall do
[2:53:40] what miracle if you let the faith get
