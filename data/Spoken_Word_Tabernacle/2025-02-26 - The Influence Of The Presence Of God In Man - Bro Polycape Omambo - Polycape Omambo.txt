armance let us pray first to the Lord Eternal God the creator of Heaven and Earth we're here this evening in your house we're in your table to eat something your children came to eat they did not come to hear someone but to hear you God and we're all together here waiting for you we're asking to remove us from the control of the church starting from the p all the way to the last roow you speak to your people deliver your people encourage may you also manifest you never wanted to be to dwell in those created from the hands of men you created yourself a body and there is a body that you're building it's in us the individual your children so you God can dwell because you do not want to dwell in what Man created understand that your word is are the brakes that construct they're the brakes that build the house when your people are listening to the word it's what creates the house that's why we sick in our everything that changes by the word by prayer in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because that name is Sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ us from the start to the end and we're bending your people those that are here present in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ am amen you may be seated where we just came from Reading he told his people go to go onto a land flowing with milk and honey and God refused to be with them amen [Music] amen because God said for I will not go up into I will not go up in the midst of thee for thou art a stiff neck people lest I consume thee in the way because the people of God found themselves in sin amen amen see here just in a minute we read we can build our subject of this evening we'll take Joshua chap 3 verse 11-13 first may God be worshiped it's written like this behold the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord of all the Earth passes over before you into Jordan now therefore take you 12 men out of the tribes of Israel out of every tribe a man and and it shall come to pass as soon as the souls of the feet of the priests that bear the Ark of the Lord the Lord of all the Earth shall rest in the waters of Jordan that the Waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above and they shall stand upon a HP over here the Ark of the Lord represents the presence of God in in the people's midst amen amen H when you have the presence of God in front of what any type of Trials the trials will back away amen why because there's the presence of God and that's what we'll be talking about is the influence of the presence of God in a man amen amen and this presence of God will see it in two manners the presence of God can be in someone's life and man is praying but nothing has happening God is not answering you can go up to the mountains and pray you can make you can do a lot of fasting and praying and God is not answering amen that's what we'll see this evening pay attention I read in Joshua chapter 7 I will read something there I will jump a little because we don't have enough time I will start from verse six I'll start from the first verse but the children of Israel committed a trespass in the in the accursed thing for the son of Ki and the son of zabdi and the son of Zarah this of the tribe of Judah took of the accursed thing and the anger of the Lord was kindled against the children of Israel and the man of a smoke of them about 30 and6 men for they chased them from before the gate even onto sheim and smoke them in the going down where wherefore the hearts of the people melted and became as water I'm jumping over here we read somewhere Joshua was telling to the that the people of God will be behind and he took the priest and the Asians they took the Ark of the Lord and he told them we're faced with Jordan we're in front of a trial you will walk before the people when you will pass when your feet will go the water and the water will separate to all to allow the people of God to walk in dry grounds and that's what they did the presence of God was there active amen that's why when the priest when they started when they started placing their foot on the water the Jordan was separating and the people walked on dry ground why because they had the presence of God which was active AC but now look again the same story in there were a small country Joshua sent a man to do a scouting and when the people of God came they said it's a small nation we don't need to take our whole nation to go com get we only take 2,000 or three thousand to go take this small nation and Joshua accepted that but you notice when we read in verse five and the of of them about 30 and six men that slew 36 and the people lost faith but in verse six JHU and Joshua rent his clothes and fell to and fell and fell to the Earth upon his face before the Ark of the Lord until the he and the Elders of Israel and put upon their heads here Joshua before the ark before the he recognized the he recognized this the error he noticed that God did not react in his life like in your life you you might be praying you might be asking whatever you're asking for you ask for inter intercession here and you can ask for prophets for your case they will pray and there's no solution why because there was something that was not right somewhere and the man of God understood he took the elders even rent his clothes and they started praying Joshua has said alas oh Lord wherefore has th at all brought this before over Jordan to deliver us the hand of amorites to destroy would to God we had been content and dwelt on the other side Jordan oh Lord what shall I say when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies I will look at verse 10 the th upon thy face one thing they made it and they kill the people but look at one element prayer of Joshua activated the presence of God and God had came down to solve to look at the um problem to reveal the Sol the problem in verse 11 God said Israel have sinned they have also transgressed my have commanded themen of the accursed thing and they have also stolen also and they have put even among their own stuff you understand you understood one element may God be praised and in that instant the children of Israel could not win the war win the battle as long as Sin is within you you will not win we seen with the pastor Isaiah 59 Isaiah 59 1 [Music] to then we'll return to Joshua Isaiah 59 I'll read a little something and there what did God say behold the Lord's hand is not shortened that he cannot neither his ears heavy that he cannot hear but your your iniquities have se but it's your sin that has but your iniquities have separated between you and your God and your sins have hid his face from you that ye that he will not hear for your hands are defiled with blood and your fingers with iniquities and your lips have spoken lies your tongue have have moded perverse perverseness you see that the presence of God was passive because there were sin and verse 13 listen God is giving [Music] order he said Joshua stand upan sanctify the people and he said verse 13 said up sanctify the people and say sanctify yourself against tomorrow for thus say the Lord God of Israel there is an accursed thing in the midst of thee oh Israel thou can not stand before thy enemies until you take away the accursed thing from among you that's right before you do anything sanctify the people and then they call the people every tribe based on the family to detect to detect who had sinned because the one that has sinned went ah H thems the sin of of an individual in a church block the manifestation the Divine manifestation of God the church blocked the healing of God in the church all it takes is one person aen was one person 36 men were dead because of him Israel um committed a defect because of him because of sin and when they made a call for all the people God was making every family pass the family of of of everybody when he came to the family of Judah now they're taking each family they arrive to the family of and they ask a son and Joshua said unto aen my son give I pray thee glory to the Lord God of Israel and make confession unto him and tell and tell me now what thou Hast done hide it not from me first 20 to 21 and aen answered Joshua and said indeed I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel and thus and thus have I done when I saw among the spoil the spoils a goodly babylonish garment and 200 shekele of silver and a wedge of gold of 50 shekels we then I covered them and took them and behold they are HID in the earth in the midst of my tent and the silver under it and you see just because of one person the family did not Advance the church did not Advance the nation did not advance until God spoke and when they removed a they took everything that he had and then they killed him that's how Israel went and um conquered the small nation the prophet says the prophe say in give me a sec in a bling prophet in paragraph 1 107 and on this Sunday night meeting father sing the blet of the Bible Hollywood connect the prophet says in 1956 a blushing Prophet paragraph 107 and on this Sunday night meeting father seeing the blushing prophet of the Bible we blush tonight I blush before you because because the sins of the people the people my nation my people I've been ashamed of them Lord to see to see our young ladies walking the streets and acting the way they do they are to see the prostitution the young men living in all kinds of lives see them staying home from church and reading old magazines they ought not to read looking at uncensored programs listening to Hollywood's dirty jokes listening to old Boogie woggie music of the de of the devil that's hatched out that's hatched out from men that's of ill of ill Fame and God V and God V conscience conss the devil's influence to inspire The Works of the devil on paragraph in paragraph 108 says oh God I'm ashame of myself for not rebuking in the way that I should oh God take away my guilt I ask you to do it I ask you to forgive these people that forgive these people that's here first us all even me behind the pulpit help us to raise from this from this altar as new men and woman help us to go from here as Christians ought to go read in Joshua 7 verse 6 and the verse 13 we saw two element that had activated the presence of God that rendered the presence of God active it was the prayer of Joshua who humbled himself not by arrogance he had humbled himself before God when you're TR when you're going through certain um moments or certain trials and that you humble yourself from all your heart you humble yourself you lower yourself with from all your heart God will listen and he will activate his presence and we saw the second element that activates the presence of God it's a Sanctified life see the prophet where he saying speaking of an influence of another he says this you can see examp maybe a woman maybe she's meeting with her other um girlfriends maybe they're single maybe they're married now her in herself she had taken a decision that me for example person who will touch my body is the person that will honor me the person who I will touch is the person who I will marry flesh the body is the Temple of Tabernacle I cannot defile it and she lives her life but when she meets a company when she meets friends they would tell her a woman cannot be like this a woman cannot wait like this all the way till she will marry but she already had a decision to keep herself to protect herself and to be faithful for her husband but because of the group because of a friend or because of a friend someone deviates easily amen amen and they destroy the word of God amen amen you can see a man who's going to work because of friend or Soul he and then he comes home and change why because he was influenced by his work friends you can see children going to school you see the parent gave them a certain influence of the word of God and now they went to school and now by arriving at school they find friends that may influence them to do whatever whatsoever and then they defile their body we'll read something from the prophet trying to run with in um Hebrew chapter 7 second part Hebrew chapter 7 number two INF in 1957 Hebrews chapter 7 number two paragraph 342 349 and you people with these saw blade tampers that's always spouting off in the mouth in the mouth at somebody can't put it up and things like that be careful you're guilty if you speak a word against your brother that's not that's not right not just not just go around and tear down and tear it down you don't have to stick you don't have to stick a knife in the men's back to kill him you can break his character and kill him kill his influence speak against your pastor here say something bad about him you just might as well as shout him told something that wasn't right about him well it'll kill his influence with the people and the and the things like that and you're guilty of it that's what Jesus said you can imagine you're a child you're going to school or you're going somewhere you start speaking ill of your own parent you're killing them you imag you're going somewhere speaking ill of your own wife or of your own [Applause] children you can imagine you a woman a wife you're speaking ill of your husband or your children to someone else you're you've killed even yourself [Music] okay in paragraph 15 in 1959 question and answer in paragraph 90 the prophet says say well i' go to I'll go to the church and I'd praise the Lord if I felt like it well now a priest is to make a sacrif rice and you the congregation as you all are right here are high Priests of God to make a spiritual sacrifice that's the fruit of your lips giving praise to God [Music] [Music] [Music] in 1960 in the paragram Church age paragraph 7 79 see it is just see it just goes to show give the best that you have give your life give your time give everything to Christ and that same spirit that lived in Christ lives in you and your influence in your neighborhood and upon the people that you dwell with will be so much like Christ till it will work the same thing Christ [Music] did I read something in um The Book of Matthew chapter chapter 28 Jesus telling the discipl to do whatever Matthew chapter 28 verse 20 it says teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I Am With You Always even onto the end of the world amen amen amen here Jesus is saying not that he will be not that he will be with you on Monday so that way you can fall on not that he will be with you this Wednesday and after tomorrow you go and then you commit said always every day he's always present amen amen now we seen there's a presence of God that doesn't have effect where you can find yourself in a trial you're praying you're fasting and there's nothing why why is that the case because there amen amen we read something of God can be active you have God and God is reacting when it's activated the Pres of God is activated God is reacting when it's passive God is not reacting the presence of God can be active or passive they're passive when God is there and he's not reacting we read Joshua chapter 7 Israel had the arc they had the presence of God [Music] but they were humbled before because of sin why Cas because there's elements that will deactivate the presence of God amen amen and the elements that will deactivate the presence of God it's sin amen amen God said in Isaiah 50 59 chapter chapter 59 verse 1 to 3 his arm are not short to deliver nor is his ear heavy to to listen but it's our sin sin that are putting a separation amen amen amen amen it's our sin that are putting that separation for your hands are are full of blood and crime sin is the element that deactivate the presence He Who Walks In The Life of even if he's going to church they're fasting and they're giving gift and while they're dwelling in sin even those gift they not work even if you're making a business or work it will not work amen amen will deactivate progress of that because their sin amen Cain had hatred towards Abel you because the element that deactivate the presence of God for example arrogance jeal jealousy hatred you hate your brother your brother you hate your sister you hate your spouse your husband you hate your wife you hate your parents you hate your pastor you hate your children those are elements that will deactivate the presence of God sin is a very dangerous element that deactivate the presence of God elements that activates the presence of God elements it's sanctification amen amen there's sanctification see in Matthew chapter six because the disciple ask Jesus how to pray and so forth Matthew 6 verse 9 amen Matthew 6 ver9 listen to this after this manner therefore pray Our Father which are in heaven be thy name you see the word sanctification someone that's walking in a life of ification they can arrive somewhere he doesn't need to fast he doesn't need to make long prayers and the Lord will act why because he Walking with God amen amen amen amen sanctification activates the presence of God amen amen because a life that is Sanctified It's A Life That's P aside it's a person individual that's already placed aside a sanctification is a life that's put aside a life that does not have that doesn't have compromise with wrong things that people are practicing ification or holiness it starts or activates the presence of God the physical presence of God is the manifestation of the person of the Divine person of God God God is a spirit you cannot see him right here but his physical presence it's manifested when I can make pray or when I'm preaching feel his presence see feel his presence when you have a problem and when you're praying you you will sense God reacting amen amen sanctification brings that right amen amen for that I'm not saying you cannot fast because where you're when you're in the life of sanctification you also have a revelation that if I am sanctifying I also have to be like this and to be Sanctified you have to pray because the sanctification will bring you to prayer will bring you to sanctification when you're not praying how will you sanctify yourself when you're not coming to church when missing meetings you be Sanctified God does not dwell does not dwell in what man has built God dwells in what he what is God building his word that's coming out like this listening to this word this word is sanctifying you when you're applying this word it's removing Sin from you even if you committed whatever sin it's washing you it's cleansing you amen amen [Applause] we cannot refuse to pray and fast because Jesus he himself had prayed and he also said certain demons that they can only come out because of prayers by only prayers amen may God be praised [Music] the second elementat that activates the presence of God it's attach your attachment to God to the word of God it's a word that it's a relationship in relationship with God attachment to God is element that activates the presence of God in John chapter 15 verse 1 to 5 Jesus said I am Divine in other words he is the tree in another term and you if you're the branch you get away from the tree tell me how will you bear fruit because you're detached you or a woman you're away from your husband or your wife how will you produce a fruit how will you produce children how will you produce fruit because he is the the vine you will you must attach yourself to the wife attach yourself to the to your husband husband attach yourself to the wife and they will call you a couple it means two people that becomes one when you're attached to one another the enemy will not answer what is hard and difficult God will render it simple easy where there's no where there's no way God will create a way may God be praise attached to me my S my brother my sister stay attached to the Lord and you will bear many [Applause] fruits a lot of Christians are not bearing fruits why because they're not attached to the [Applause] lord they're attached to men and [Applause] congregation you have to be attached to the Lord you have to be attached to the word of God and the father will will allow you to so you can bear a lot of fruits pres of God is activated in your life of a Christian he will bear fruits we are branches amen amen if we're attached to the to the vein the vein which is Christ will bear a lot of fruits the presence of God is what the presence of God the presence of God manif the manifestation the physical manifestation of the person of the Living God the one who is invisible in in the life of men we're seeing over here with the pastor God had said to make temples because he wanted to to man that he created and when he saw that it was not enough to dwell in the tentomon build for me a temple and in the temple he was there where people could come into the temple like you saw Solomon had prayed I have it Solomon had prayed [Music] pray I believe second Chronicle second Chronicle chapter 7 I believe yes sir yes sir okay ver and the Lord appeared to Solomon by night and said unto him I have heard thy prayer and I have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice right [Music] if I shut up Heaven that there be no rain or if I command the Locust to Devour the land or if I send pestilence among my people if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their Wicked Ways then then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land [Music] now listen to 2 Chronicle verse 2 Chronicle 7 verse1 now when Solomon had made an end of prayers of praying the the fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices and the glory of the Lord filled the house [Music] see prayer activates the presence of God it doesn't matter what your situation is this evening do not wait for tomorrow I know that I know it's that 2024 the situation that made you cry God is capable to change it in 202 amen we have seen the other time here Peter was in prison the people of God they puts in prayer and God sent Ang I don't know where are maybe it's the prison single maybe it's the prison of my maybe it's the prison of block maybe you're a prisoner of sickness I don't know what's prison your in but when the church put came together in prayer the angel had came down and opened the prison and Peter came out amen amen this 2025 you must be attach to the so you can bear fruits the fruits are visible when you pass by the tree if they're bearing fruit you will see it it doesn't matter how you're going doesn't matter your walk we need to see the fruit what's inside of you we cannot see that we don't know your heart but what we can see what we do know is the fruits that will that you will bear it's the act that you will do th will show the seed that's within [Applause] you we're in need of the presence of God to live in intimate with the [Music] Lord in the influence of another Prophet says this in paragraph 14 [Applause] the prophet said today even if I if I miss the meeting I will perish I will be lost in another term you [Music] understand okay I cannot it's an influence of another I just can't stand it something in something just inside me burning um speaking paragraph 17 we know of the woman at the world the woman with the issue of blood these people naming they something activate the presence of God what did they have they had Faith the other even only by behind If I Could Touch the Garment of Jesus my uh issue for 12 12 years will go away blind in the faith touched him and this evening my brothers and my sisters he is still the high priest of our confession

children are not listening you must confess you have to place God between you and your husband Place God between you and your children place God between you and the situation that's not [Applause] working and this evening he's still the high priest of our confession extremely he's greater than ever we must also be his servant he is the vine the source of life we are the branches that receives that life and the branches bear the fruits not the Vine and now Christ Works through and then if we can yield ourself in such a way that the Holy Spirit can take complete control of us in our faith in Christ he will do the same thing because it's [Music] [Applause] Christ another element that activates the presence of God it's humility when someone is humble the Bible say Jesus humbled himself all the way to The Obedience of death he who accepted they how how much more we can people spit on us how much more we do not even allow people to tell us the truth we always see we always but God had humbled himself has said in Proverbs 224 he said the fruits of humility of the fear of the Lord or Rich glory and life you [Music] see Christ is the vine of Christ is the Incarnation of uh humility and other elements that activates the presence of God we spoke of prayer how did Solomon pray and then the glory of God had came down amen amen the prayer is an element that activates the presence of God amen amen may God be praised may God be praised [Music] sin keeps us away from God takes us away from God but when we have a sanctification life of sanctification when we have humility that brings us closer to God amen amen that brings us closer to God the influence it's what the prophet preached about the influence influence is the capacity of of modifying a behavior or a way or a way of changing someone's thought you had a good behavior you had a good thought but when you meet an individual you change your life you start to fall you start to lie you start to steal you start to kill you start to gos said amen influence is a power it's having control over someone or something that's right am amen when someone is coming to you to influence you he has the power to control you so you can do what he says for you to do and then you'll start following him amen amen may God be praised I'm climbing down we have seen the elements that sin and in sin there's doubt and many other things
