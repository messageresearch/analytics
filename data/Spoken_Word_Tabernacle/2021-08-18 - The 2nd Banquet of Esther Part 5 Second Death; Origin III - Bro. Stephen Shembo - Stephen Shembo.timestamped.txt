[17:42] he is great
[17:44] and greatly to be praised
[17:46] there is no god like him
[17:48] [Applause]
[17:50] i used to wonder what that saying meant
[17:52] when i was a kid there's no god like him
[17:53] because i'm like he's the only god there
[17:56] obviously there's no god like him
[17:57] there's only one god and it was until i
[17:59] got older that i realized that god is an
[18:01] object of worship and though the world
[18:03] worships other things this group of
[18:05] people only worships one thing and
[18:07] that's the one true god so even people
[18:10] can make brother branham a god and we've
[18:12] been accused of that here but we don't
[18:14] do that we know that it was one the same
[18:16] i got to be careful i don't want to
[18:18] confuse anybody we know is one and the
[18:19] same but we know is god working through
[18:21] the man not the man himself but we
[18:24] believe there's only one true god one
[18:28] true god and that's the lord jesus
[18:29] christ
[18:30] and i'm grateful that he died on the
[18:32] cross for me and he saved me and then he
[18:35] sent me his prophet to teach me his word
[18:37] and to help me grow he gave us the
[18:39] pastor to our age as we're as we're
[18:41] learning and i'm so grateful for just
[18:43] his
[18:44] his plan the way he put things together
[18:46] it's just such a blessing the way he did
[18:48] it i'm so grateful for it
[18:50] does anybody have a testimony the same
[18:51] thing on their heart that they'd like to
[18:53] give
[18:56] kelly
[18:57] amen
[19:06] thank you praise the lord thanks
[19:09] i tell you it's like fire shut up in my
[19:11] bones i had to tell this testimony
[19:14] we went out sunday when we stopped by
[19:16] the restaurant to get our supper and uh
[19:19] we saw brother john and them there and
[19:21] we went in and went up the order of food
[19:24] and uh
[19:26] i stand there a gentleman came in and i
[19:28] spoke to him i said how you doing he
[19:30] said fine he walked and he looked and he
[19:32] looked at me again
[19:34] he said i got a question for you he said
[19:36] you used to go down to the jail
[19:39] and have bible study i said yes sir he
[19:41] said i thought that was you
[19:44] he said i want to let you know at the
[19:45] time i was struggling
[19:47] drinking drugging said two years he said
[19:50] i've been clean for two years
[19:52] he said i just want to tell you this
[19:56] what you doing works
[19:58] keep doing what you're doing god bless
[20:01] you
[20:02] amen
[20:04] praise the lord
[20:07] does anybody else have a testimony this
[20:09] evening
[20:10] [Applause]
[20:13] we know that prayer works
[20:15] just keep on praying pray for whatever
[20:17] you have need of because god answers
[20:19] prayer sometimes it's not always the
[20:20] answer we want but god answers prayer
[20:22] he's never failed me that's for sure
[20:25] but we have a prayer request this
[20:27] evening and i don't have a name on it so

[42:10] it go ahead and slay him
[42:12] amen
[42:13] blessed be the name of the lord let's go
[42:15] to our scripture tonight
[42:18] roman chapter 12.
[42:21] for the one who put the title on youtube
[42:24] it's origin chapter 3
[42:27] origin 3. so if you can correct that
[42:29] origin 2 was on sunday
[42:31] so we we're going origin 1 origin 2
[42:35] origin 3. i thought i'm going to preach
[42:36] it one time and move on and as soon as i
[42:39] touch it
[42:41] everything open up
[42:43] amen
[42:47] do you remember me telling you that i
[42:48] will preach on predestination
[42:52] have you caught it already
[42:54] that we're going through predestination
[42:57] have you caught it
[42:59] all you want in a title that's a
[43:01] predestination
[43:03] amen
[43:04] the way we go we navigate into a story
[43:07] in the bible
[43:08] and then through that story you'll begin
[43:11] to see things in the bible branching out
[43:14] all of this the first death the second
[43:16] death all of these are locked in the
[43:18] book of esther
[43:19] if i show you i say this is the first
[43:21] death you can say amen but you don't
[43:23] understand that's why we need to open
[43:26] the mystery of the first death open the
[43:28] second death open everything so when you
[43:30] go back to the book of esther you look
[43:32] you say i see why it's the first thing i
[43:34] see right here i see it right so the
[43:36] message gives you tools
[43:38] to unlock the scripture
[43:40] that's why paul said we preach christ
[43:43] according to the revelation of the
[43:45] mystery in other words you preach christ
[43:47] according to the message of the hour
[43:50] amen if not you're going to preach
[43:52] another christ
[43:54] yet you're saying christ but it's not
[43:56] christ
[43:57] [Laughter]
[43:59] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[44:01] lord
[44:03] brother branham was preparing to preach
[44:05] the trumpet
[44:06] he even went and searched for a room
[44:09] until the lord told him he said you
[44:12] don't have to go dara you already
[44:13] preached the trumpet when you were
[44:15] preaching the sixth hill
[44:17] amen so as i was going i said my god
[44:20] this is just pulling me to
[44:21] predestination predestination i say okay
[44:24] somebody will catch it that will
[44:25] preaching predestination
[44:27] to understand the second death you need
[44:29] to understand predestination or origin
[44:33] so it's origin one origin 2 tonight is
[44:36] origin 3. everybody clear
[44:39] yeah we saw the white throne judgment on
[44:42] sunday you saw those that are as the
[44:45] lamb and the other one as the goat amen
[44:48] and the mercy that you can give it to
[44:49] them so we continue there is a different
[44:52] area and if you get this correctly you
[44:54] will put it together in the book of life
[44:57] because remember in the white throne
[44:59] judgment the book of life is open
[45:01] why is he open
[45:03] because they are named that are going to
[45:04] be there but they are not part of the
[45:06] bride
[45:09] amen the bread is in the lamb's book of
[45:12] life
[45:14] which is a section inside the book of
[45:17] life
[45:20] oh my god romans chapter 12
[45:23] verse one
[45:26] i already felt the anointing here with
[45:28] the music so
[45:31] it's going to be
[45:33] your problem who whoever is pulling
[45:39] romans chapter 12 verse 1 if you dare
[45:41] you can say amen
[45:44] i beseech you therefore who
[45:47] you might be seated
[45:49] is paul talking to the unbelievers
[45:52] he's talking to her
[45:54] if you miss this you're not going to
[45:56] understand the scripture
[46:00] this is why people has been preaching
[46:01] the gospel a different way
[46:04] amen i beseech you who
[46:07] so paul is talking to who
[46:09] [Music]
[46:11] paul is talking to believers
[46:20] the devil you're just wasting your time
[46:25] the breathing
[46:27] all believers
[46:29] everybody clear
[46:31] so when you keep this in mind
[46:33] then you will understand what is coming
[46:35] down if you miss this
[46:38] you miss everything amen
[46:41] i beseech you therefore brethren
[46:44] by the mercies of god we know who he who
[46:48] is the vessels of mercy
[46:50] amen
[46:51] that you present your bodies
[46:54] i living sacrifice that's why we don't
[46:57] put high heels we don't put makeup we
[47:00] don't put all this kind of stuff because
[47:02] our body are reflecting the gospel
[47:05] amen
[47:06] watch it now
[47:08] a living sacrifice holy
[47:10] acceptable to god which is your
[47:13] reasonable service we already explained
[47:15] to you this many times
[47:17] now jump to verse three
[47:20] remember in verse one it's brethren
[47:22] verse 3
[47:24] for i say
[47:26] through the grace given to me
[47:28] to every man that is among who
[47:32] who are they you
[47:34] the believer so he's talking about the
[47:36] believer keep that in mind
[47:38] amen
[47:40] not to think of himself
[47:43] more highly than he ought to think
[47:46] but to think soberly
[47:48] according as god
[47:51] has dealt to every man the measure of
[47:56] water
[47:57] god didn't give everybody the measure of
[48:00] faith
[48:08] amen
[48:10] it is to the brethren
[48:13] to the believers
[48:16] do you see how we preach the gospel down
[48:17] there
[48:18] oh god gave everybody the measure of
[48:20] faith no
[48:22] everybody doesn't have the measure of
[48:24] faith
[48:28] if they have the measure of faith
[48:30] they're going to be saved
[48:34] but not everybody is going to be saved
[48:36] make sense now
[48:38] so to these brethren these believers
[48:41] their god gave them a measure
[48:44] of faith
[48:47] that's what makes them believers
[48:49] [Music]
[48:52] amen
[48:54] god because usually what we say we say
[48:56] god has dealt to every man the measure
[48:58] of faith so we have a tendency to think
[49:01] like everybody in this world has been
[49:02] given a measure of faith
[49:06] that's not the case
[49:08] it is only to them
[49:10] by the believer according to your origin
[49:15] make sense
[49:16] in non-seed there is
[49:19] nothing to
[49:22] how are you going to have faith
[49:24] there are certain people that are
[49:26] non-seed
[49:28] you see now amen
[49:30] so i said through the grace given to me
[49:33] to every man that is among you among the
[49:36] believers i'm talking to the believer
[49:39] not to think of himself more highly than
[49:41] he ought to think
[49:42] but to think soberly according as god
[49:45] has dealt to every man those believers
[49:48] the measure of faith
[49:52] for us we have many members in how many
[49:55] body
[49:56] so we who is he talking to
[49:58] the believer of the body of who
[50:01] makes sense now
[50:03] everybody that entered there entered by
[50:05] birth
[50:06] by one spirit we are born into the body
[50:10] if you burn into the body god gave you a
[50:13] measure of what
[50:15] if not you are outside so as we have
[50:18] many members in one body and all members
[50:20] have not the same office
[50:23] everybody clear
[50:24] so we being many are one body in christ
[50:28] you see that
[50:30] and everyone remember one of another
[50:33] having then gift that fairing according
[50:36] to the grace that is given to us where
[50:38] the prophecy let us prophesy according
[50:42] to the water
[50:43] proportion of water
[50:45] you see that
[50:47] a measure of faith everybody clear so
[50:50] what i want you to keep here to every
[50:53] believer not everybody
[50:55] i know it's going to be a different
[50:57] avenue
[50:58] but you're going to get it down the road
[51:00] i have scripture and we're going to back
[51:02] it up amen
[51:03] if we get on sunday then you'll see more
[51:05] things unfolding so to every believer
[51:08] god give a measure of faith
[51:11] everybody clear
[51:12] when boaz was
[51:15] redeeming naomi
[51:17] was boaz going to get married to naomi
[51:22] everybody here
[51:24] if you look at the work he's working for
[51:26] naomi but in his backyard mind
[51:29] he's going to get married to ruth
[51:34] amen
[51:35] let's go to titus chapter 2.
[51:42] usually
[51:43] i keep them in order
[51:45] but if i do it today you're not going to
[51:48] get it
[51:50] so we need to go back and forth
[52:00] usually i want you to go one two three
[52:02] today you're going one three and two
[52:05] amen
[52:07] tattoos too
[52:09] if you dare you can say amen
[52:12] all right verse 11
[52:14] for the grace of god that brings
[52:17] salvation
[52:18] has appeared to who
[52:24] so all men can be saved
[52:29] let's see
[52:30] the grace of god
[52:32] appeared to who
[52:37] did they say whether they believe it or
[52:38] not
[52:42] the grace of god
[52:44] that brings salvation
[52:46] has appeared to all men
[52:50] the rich young ruler met salvation
[52:57] the rich young ruler
[52:59] met the grace that was bringing
[53:02] salvation
[53:04] but even though he came in contact with
[53:08] the grace that brings salvation he ended
[53:12] up in hell
[53:17] even though salvation appeared to all
[53:20] men
[53:22] not all men will be saved
[53:29] make sense now
[53:32] amen
[53:33] teaching us
[53:35] that denying ungodliness and worldly
[53:38] lust
[53:38] we should live soberly
[53:41] righteously and godly in this present
[53:44] world
[53:46] looking for that blessed hope and the
[53:48] glorious appearing of the great god
[53:53] and our savior
[53:57] the great god
[53:59] deity ready
[54:01] jesus is god
[54:03] the great god
[54:05] me and my father we are
[54:07] what i want you to keep is the grace
[54:10] that brings salvation appeal to all men
[54:13] but not really all men
[54:17] let's go to second thessalonians
[54:20] now you need to go back
[54:26] amen
[54:27] we read this before so you should be
[54:29] familiar
[54:32] hallelujah
[54:34] blessed be the name of the lord 2nd
[54:38] thessalonians 2 verse 9
[54:41] even him the antichrist
[54:44] whose coming is after the working of
[54:46] satan
[54:47] with all power
[54:49] and son
[54:50] and lying wonders
[54:52] amen is working by the power of satan
[54:56] amen
[54:57] and with all deceivableness
[55:00] of unrighteousness in them that do water
[55:03] so certain people will perish
[55:07] there is something in certain people
[55:10] that will make them believe the
[55:13] antichrist
[55:13] [Music]
[55:17] this is hard food because
[55:21] they receive not the love of the water
[55:25] that there might be water
[55:27] or how can salvation appear to everybody
[55:31] but some people did not receive the love
[55:33] of the truth
[55:37] you should be really thankful if you
[55:40] were a christian
[55:42] amen
[55:44] god could have chose you to be somebody
[55:46] else
[55:48] amen
[55:50] but he could not he didn't have no
[55:53] choice no option to choose you because
[55:56] you were in it
[56:04] the real you
[56:06] not the one i'm looking at right now but
[56:08] the real you
[56:10] never had the beginning
[56:13] [Music]
[56:19] don't worry church we're going to preach
[56:20] you into this
[56:23] going to repeat it repeat it until you
[56:25] get it
[56:27] and for this cause god sent them strong
[56:32] delusion
[56:33] that they should believe the water
[56:36] you can talk to them bring scripture
[56:38] bring code brings pictures they don't
[56:40] see it
[56:44] yet the grace of god that brings
[56:46] salvation appear too
[56:50] you see now
[56:52] let's see
[56:55] that they all might be damned condemned
[56:59] who believe not the truth
[57:03] but had pleasure in water
[57:05] how do you condemn them because there is
[57:08] nothing that was put there to receive
[57:10] the truth that's why paul said who are
[57:12] you to
[57:14] question god
[57:18] he's the powder
[57:19] he can bring the vessel off
[57:22] and reversal of what
[57:24] it's the sovereignty of god
[57:27] amen
[57:28] but we are bound to give thank our words
[57:31] to god for you
[57:33] always for you why brethren beloved of
[57:37] the lord because god has from the
[57:40] beginning chosen you to what
[57:43] you didn't put yourself there you were
[57:46] programmed to be saved
[57:49] amen
[57:51] through sanctification
[57:53] of the spirit and belief of the water
[57:56] that sanctification is of the spirit
[57:58] it's the holy spirit doing that
[58:01] amen not you
[58:04] and belief of the water
[58:06] it is god believing god
[58:11] you are just a carrier of god
[58:17] hallelujah
[58:18] hallelujah
[58:20] when mary carried the seed of jesus
[58:23] christ
[58:24] amen when she spoke the name of jesus
[58:27] christ john the baptist over there in
[58:29] the belly
[58:30] from the belly to the belly they were
[58:32] communicating
[58:36] amen
[58:38] where do he call you by our gospel
[58:42] to the obtaining of the glory of the
[58:44] lord jesus christ
[58:46] brethren therefore brethren stand fast
[58:49] and hold the tradition
[58:52] which you have been taught whether by
[58:54] word the voice you remember tapes or
[58:57] episode which is the books
[59:00] in the time of paul it was word
[59:02] and epistle in our time we get 10th
[59:05] recorder they recorded it we have word
[59:08] and we have books
[59:10] i preach like paul
[59:16] do you see i preach like paul
[59:21] if he preached like paul what do you
[59:22] expect
[59:24] amen
[59:25] now job to chapter 3.
[59:28] finally brethren pray for us
[59:30] that the word of the lord may have free
[59:33] course
[59:34] and be glorified even as it is with you
[59:40] so with this believer the word of god
[59:43] has a
[59:44] highway free course
[59:47] when you preach
[59:48] destination amen
[59:51] and it's been glorified amen
[59:53] watch verse two and that we may be
[59:56] delivered
[59:58] from our unreasonable and
[1:00:01] wicked water
[1:00:05] the grace of man of god
[1:00:08] that saved all man
[1:00:10] that's that brings salvation appeal to
[1:00:12] how many men
[1:00:15] oh man
[1:00:16] jesus love everybody
[1:00:19] amen
[1:00:21] delivered from unreasonable and wicked
[1:00:24] man you there
[1:00:26] for all men
[1:00:28] right here
[1:00:30] the grace that appeared to all men
[1:00:33] all men same word for all men
[1:00:38] have not water
[1:00:45] so there are certain people
[1:00:47] that do have faith
[1:00:50] because they were predestinated to be
[1:00:53] saved and other do not have faith
[1:01:00] how do you expect them together
[1:01:03] amen
[1:01:05] the origin will determine if you can you
[1:01:08] are subject to the second death or not
[1:01:12] everybody clear
[1:01:13] so we started he was talking to the
[1:01:16] brethren to the believer god gave them a
[1:01:18] measure of faith predestinated
[1:01:21] from before the foundation of the word
[1:01:23] for you to be saved the grace of god
[1:01:26] appeared to all men
[1:01:28] but paul continued he says that all men
[1:01:31] do not have
[1:01:32] faith
[1:01:33] so you're going to have a mixed malted
[1:01:38] pray
[1:01:39] heavenly father lord we thank you again

[1:01:44] for everything you have been doing in
[1:01:46] the midst of your children father thank
[1:01:48] you for giving us another opportunity
[1:01:51] tonight to gather together around the
[1:01:53] revealed world of the hour
[1:01:55] father i have done what every man that
[1:01:58] you given an ability to can do lord this
[1:02:01] is as far as i can go but now father we
[1:02:04] are looking unto thee the holy spirit to
[1:02:07] come down and to minister to us lord
[1:02:09] father remember again lord father sister
[1:02:12] sherrod you know exactly what to do in
[1:02:15] every circumstances because there is
[1:02:17] nothing that takes you lord by by uh by
[1:02:21] chance you already know everything prior
[1:02:23] the foundation of the world because
[1:02:25] you're a god that is infinite the god
[1:02:28] that knows everything lord father what
[1:02:30] we're asking is for your grace lord
[1:02:32] father to overcome every situation and
[1:02:36] bring lord father solution where it's
[1:02:38] needed lord father may the devil
[1:02:41] and his army be completely sealed out of
[1:02:44] this place and this property father may
[1:02:47] nothing but the holy spirit lord and the
[1:02:50] angel of the living god
[1:02:52] not the devil but the angel of the
[1:02:54] living god the elect angel father be
[1:02:58] here ministering to your children lord
[1:03:01] we commit everything unto the hand in
[1:03:03] jesus precious name
[1:03:05] amen
[1:03:06] god richly bless you you've already been
[1:03:09] seated like i stated we are in the
[1:03:12] second banquet of esther part five we're
[1:03:14] dealing with the second death but origin
[1:03:17] part three everybody clear on sunday we
[1:03:20] already seen about the white throne
[1:03:22] judgment when we spoke about men we know
[1:03:25] that men have three parts the soul the
[1:03:27] spirit and the body everybody clears so
[1:03:30] far
[1:03:31] then the soul and the spirit make the
[1:03:33] spiritual man or the living part of a
[1:03:35] man and the body make the natural man or
[1:03:38] the non-living part of the man because
[1:03:41] james said that the body without the
[1:03:43] spirit is dead in other words if you
[1:03:45] take the spirit out completely the body
[1:03:48] cannot move it's the spirit that makes
[1:03:51] the body operate amen
[1:03:53] now since we're dealing with the
[1:03:54] spiritual death about the body i wanted
[1:03:57] to go back here and drop again slowly
[1:04:00] in luke chapter 12 the bible says that
[1:04:03] and i say unto you my friend
[1:04:05] be not afraid of them that can kill the
[1:04:07] body and after that have no more that
[1:04:11] they can do
[1:04:12] so we can see right here that
[1:04:15] i even though the killing of the body is
[1:04:18] not the end
[1:04:20] amen
[1:04:21] the killing of the body is the end to
[1:04:24] satan and to the people of the world
[1:04:27] but there is something that you can do
[1:04:30] beyond the killing of the body amen
[1:04:33] what can you do
[1:04:35] but i will forewarn you
[1:04:37] whom you shall fear i'm gonna show you
[1:04:39] who you should respect
[1:04:41] feel him which after he had killed
[1:04:45] he can kill just like satan
[1:04:47] he can kill just like anybody can shoot
[1:04:49] you amen he can kill like a car accident
[1:04:52] or something after he had killed has
[1:04:56] power to cast into hell so the first
[1:05:00] thing that we see from god here god can
[1:05:03] open the door for death to strike you
[1:05:07] amen but depending on your origin
[1:05:11] if your origin was not from the mind of
[1:05:13] god
[1:05:14] god will cast you into hell
[1:05:17] anybody clear
[1:05:19] this hell here
[1:05:21] have a meaning
[1:05:23] it means prison
[1:05:26] amen
[1:05:28] because you need to be judged
[1:05:31] before they execute you anybody clear
[1:05:34] i'm going to get down the road into the
[1:05:36] prison how was that prison open
[1:05:39] because hell was created
[1:05:42] amen hell did not exist before hair was
[1:05:45] created
[1:05:47] because the devil
[1:05:49] rebel so they got to be a prison to put
[1:05:51] him
[1:05:52] amen
[1:05:54] hallelujah
[1:05:55] matthew 28
[1:05:58] 10 28 and fear not them which killed the
[1:06:01] body they can do it satan can do it and
[1:06:04] the people can do it
[1:06:06] but are not able to kill the soul that's
[1:06:09] a second part amen
[1:06:11] but rather
[1:06:13] in in luke chapter 12
[1:06:15] you can get killed and they put you in
[1:06:18] here but you are still alive
[1:06:23] you are alive in hell in your soul
[1:06:27] which is living in a theophany
[1:06:31] amen everybody clear that's why the rich
[1:06:34] young ruler was in soul talking to
[1:06:36] father abraham
[1:06:39] everybody
[1:06:40] ever here if you remember the souls
[1:06:43] under the altar were crying out they
[1:06:45] were crying out for vengeance so when
[1:06:48] you die here you are now really dead
[1:06:50] you are still alive because paul said if
[1:06:53] this tabernacle dissolved we enter into
[1:06:57] another tabernacle amen so god first
[1:07:00] have the power to open death
[1:07:02] the first death to hit your body then
[1:07:04] you can put you in soul as in prison but
[1:07:08] in soul in hell you can still be living
[1:07:12] like the rich young ruler he was talking
[1:07:14] to abraham and he recognized uh
[1:07:17] uh lazarus ever clear but in matthew 10
[1:07:21] verse 28 the bible says here that it is
[1:07:25] who who can kill the body
[1:07:28] but are not able to kill the soul
[1:07:30] now it's not talking about the killing
[1:07:33] of the body only and going to hell but
[1:07:35] it's talking about the killing of the
[1:07:37] body about here and then this is
[1:07:41] followed by the killing of the soul
[1:07:45] and back here in this place you are no
[1:07:48] longer in existence
[1:07:51] anybody here
[1:07:52] on the first scenario you are killed you
[1:07:56] put in here you still alive but you
[1:07:58] alive and atonement because you're in
[1:08:01] prison
[1:08:02] under the flame look
[1:08:04] anybody here the book of luke but in
[1:08:06] here when they kill you
[1:08:09] amen
[1:08:10] they kill again your soul you disappear
[1:08:13] completely you are no longer in
[1:08:15] existence
[1:08:17] what are you trying to say
[1:08:19] but rather feel him which is able to
[1:08:22] destroy buff water
[1:08:24] and body where
[1:08:26] the hell is not this hell
[1:08:35] this hair
[1:08:36] is a hell that destroyed the body
[1:08:41] and destroy what
[1:08:44] this one is just a prison
[1:08:47] that they put you in
[1:08:49] waiting for your court trial anybody
[1:08:52] clear but being in prison you are not
[1:08:55] comfortable you are tormented
[1:08:58] ever clear but this hell here is a
[1:09:01] different hair it's a hell that when
[1:09:03] they put you there he also killed the
[1:09:06] body but the body was already killed
[1:09:08] here why does this hair have to kill the
[1:09:10] body again
[1:09:13] makes sense now in here they kill your
[1:09:15] body
[1:09:16] and then you stay alive
[1:09:18] in here they killed the body and the
[1:09:21] soul so to kill this body the body must
[1:09:25] be alive again
[1:09:29] anybody here there is a resurrection
[1:09:32] that happened to this body
[1:09:35] ever here
[1:09:36] and then this body and the soul that
[1:09:39] entering must be destroyed
[1:09:41] i'm going slowly
[1:09:43] [Laughter]
[1:09:46] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:09:48] hallelujah that's why when you look in a
[1:09:50] different translation you will see they
[1:09:52] change that word hell
[1:09:55] into gehenna
[1:09:57] make sense now
[1:09:59] okay
[1:10:00] in revelation chapter 20 verse 11 and i
[1:10:04] saw a great white throne and him that
[1:10:06] sat on it from whose face the earth and
[1:10:09] the heaven fled away that's a judge and
[1:10:11] there was no
[1:10:12] no there was fun no place for them and i
[1:10:15] saw the dead
[1:10:17] small and great you remember this
[1:10:20] not the same age
[1:10:21] small and great
[1:10:23] stand before god
[1:10:26] they were dead
[1:10:29] remember by now they are standing before
[1:10:32] god
[1:10:33] so a resurrection happened
[1:10:36] but the resurrect the way they went into
[1:10:39] the grave
[1:10:42] if they die as a teenager they woke up
[1:10:46] teenager
[1:10:47] if they die 40 years old they woke up 40
[1:10:51] years old
[1:10:52] but when they wake up they are waking up
[1:10:54] before the judgment
[1:10:57] amen that's why brother branham said
[1:10:59] resurrection is not replacement
[1:11:03] resurrection is what went down there
[1:11:06] coming back up again and when they back
[1:11:09] up again in the same body if they were
[1:11:12] thinking about going to the nightclub
[1:11:16] and they got involved in the car wreck
[1:11:19] when they woke up they woke up with the
[1:11:21] same desire
[1:11:25] did you follow me
[1:11:26] you remember i showed you that in the
[1:11:29] book of ezekiel the bible says when a
[1:11:31] sinner died his sin lays on his one
[1:11:35] bones you remember they go with their
[1:11:38] sin in their body so when they are
[1:11:40] resurrected back for judgment they are
[1:11:43] resurrected with their sin
[1:11:47] now god need to destroy both their body
[1:11:51] and
[1:11:56] do you love the bible
[1:11:58] is it clear now so this distraction this
[1:12:01] hair is something else
[1:12:09] at the opening of the seventh hill
[1:12:12] the bible became anew
[1:12:16] what is the name of this hell
[1:12:19] amen
[1:12:20] and books were open
[1:12:22] and another book was open so there are
[1:12:25] many books
[1:12:28] oh god give me time which is the book of
[1:12:31] life so here there are books
[1:12:34] plural
[1:12:36] and there is another book which is the
[1:12:38] book of life
[1:12:39] so in the judgment there are many books
[1:12:43] and they are the book of life
[1:12:45] amen here they're going to read a lot of
[1:12:48] stuff in your life but the final
[1:12:50] determination
[1:12:52] where you going will be the book of life
[1:12:56] the book of life is the supreme judge
[1:13:01] it's the book of origin
[1:13:05] amen
[1:13:07] and another book was open which is the
[1:13:10] book of life and the dead were judged
[1:13:13] out of those things which were written
[1:13:15] in the what
[1:13:16] not the book of life
[1:13:19] so when you do bad things somebody is
[1:13:21] recording
[1:13:23] anybody
[1:13:26] everybody
[1:13:27] when you're drinking when you're smoking
[1:13:29] when you're committing fornication and
[1:13:31] everything somebody's recording in
[1:13:33] heaven and not only recording us writing
[1:13:37] but they are also recording you with a
[1:13:39] camera
[1:13:43] hallelujah
[1:13:45] according to the water
[1:13:47] work so this book here these books are
[1:13:51] books that record your works
[1:13:54] is the bread here
[1:13:59] so what happened to your works
[1:14:04] and the sea gave up the dead
[1:14:07] which were in it and death and hell
[1:14:09] deliver up the dead there is a
[1:14:11] resurrection
[1:14:12] which were in them and they were judged
[1:14:15] every man according to the water
[1:14:18] they are still using the books
[1:14:21] he did this he stole he did this he went
[1:14:23] drinking he didn't listen to his father
[1:14:26] all of that written you wanted that
[1:14:28] record cleared there is a way to clear
[1:14:30] it
[1:14:31] amen
[1:14:32] and death and hell were cast in the lake
[1:14:36] of what
[1:14:38] this is the second
[1:14:42] and whosoever
[1:14:45] was not found
[1:14:48] written in the book of life
[1:14:51] eberle
[1:14:52] was cast into the lake of water
[1:14:55] so the place where the body
[1:14:58] and the soul
[1:15:00] are destroyed is the lake of water
[1:15:03] so this hell here is the lake of fire
[1:15:11] everybody here
[1:15:12] the first hell is a prison
[1:15:16] they put you to be judged
[1:15:19] amen
[1:15:20] your soul is put in torment
[1:15:22] until the appropriate time which is the
[1:15:25] judgment of the white throne
[1:15:27] but in this judgment of the white throne
[1:15:30] you're going to be resurrected back
[1:15:32] again if you didn't go by the atonement
[1:15:35] ever here and when you are resurrected
[1:15:37] with the same sin and the same desire
[1:15:40] that you have
[1:15:41] ever here if you die with a tattoo you
[1:15:45] are waking up with a tattoo
[1:15:52] hallelujah there is only one way to
[1:15:55] remove your title
[1:15:57] if you can't see a surgeon
[1:16:00] it's to have a glorified body
[1:16:06] ever cleared so far
[1:16:08] so we see that here we can destroy both
[1:16:11] the soul in hell both the soul and the
[1:16:13] body in hell who's doing that it's the
[1:16:16] judge who's the judge it's the lord he's
[1:16:20] our lawgiver he's our king he will do
[1:16:23] what
[1:16:24] save us
[1:16:26] in james chapter 4 verse 12 the bible
[1:16:28] says there is one lawgiver which is god
[1:16:31] who is able to save and to destroy
[1:16:35] remember one he's saving
[1:16:38] about here
[1:16:40] the other one he's destroying
[1:16:43] when he's saving his lamb
[1:16:47] when he's destroying his leo the lion
[1:16:50] anybody clear
[1:16:52] but we
[1:16:53] who accepted the atonement
[1:16:55] amen for john there is no leo the lion
[1:17:00] leo the lion for john is a blessing
[1:17:06] ever here for the bread of jesus christ
[1:17:09] the coming of the lord is not something
[1:17:12] they feel it's something they're
[1:17:14] actually waiting expecting and longing
[1:17:17] for because when the judge come
[1:17:21] not only is he coming to get us but he
[1:17:24] is coming with a different revelation of
[1:17:27] justification
[1:17:31] hallelujah
[1:17:32] the bible says that he that comes to me
[1:17:36] is
[1:17:37] i will in no ways cast out is that right
[1:17:40] and listen here is the man's word about
[1:17:43] it jesus christ
[1:17:45] saint john 5 24
[1:17:47] he
[1:17:48] whosoever he that heareth my words and
[1:17:51] believeth on him that sent me has
[1:17:54] present tense has now presented
[1:17:58] everlasting water
[1:18:00] that is not just from one meeting to
[1:18:03] another
[1:18:04] that is a temporary but this one is
[1:18:07] eternal everlasting
[1:18:08] that is not just for one meaning to
[1:18:11] another everlasting life
[1:18:14] and shall not come into work
[1:18:18] so there is no way you can stand to be
[1:18:20] judged
[1:18:22] that's why the scriptures say blessed is
[1:18:25] who who's gonna be part in the first
[1:18:28] resurrection
[1:18:29] the second death has nothing to do with
[1:18:32] you because your judgment is already
[1:18:35] when you're alive
[1:18:38] hallelujah you shall not come into
[1:18:41] judgment or
[1:18:42] condemnation never be cast away
[1:18:46] you can never go to the lake of fire
[1:18:50] because you cannot kill god
[1:18:52] [Music]
[1:19:03] how do you kill him again
[1:19:06] amen
[1:19:07] saint john 5 24 jesus said so i am the
[1:19:11] bread of life that come from heaven out
[1:19:13] of heaven for your father's eighth man
[1:19:16] are in the wilderness and are dead we're
[1:19:18] going to get into this but he that eats
[1:19:20] my flesh and drink my blood have
[1:19:23] everlasting life and i shall raise him
[1:19:25] up at the last day in other words he's
[1:19:27] not gonna face the second death which is
[1:19:30] the lake of fire
[1:19:32] to destroy your body and to destroy your
[1:19:35] soul in other words to wipe you out of
[1:19:38] existence
[1:19:39] if they wipe you out of existence it
[1:19:42] means you never existed before
[1:19:47] everybody here
[1:19:49] those that received the second death had
[1:19:52] a beginning
[1:19:57] everybody here
[1:19:58] oh my that makes you forget the hot
[1:20:01] weather
[1:20:02] notice and while you are in that body
[1:20:05] you are just as free from condemnation
[1:20:08] as he is
[1:20:09] you shall never have to stand any
[1:20:12] judgment
[1:20:15] god cause judgment to be struck upon his
[1:20:18] body
[1:20:19] and if you are in him god cannot judge
[1:20:22] you
[1:20:23] he is already judged you when he judge
[1:20:27] christ
[1:20:28] that's why you don't go to the
[1:20:29] tribulation period the sixth year he
[1:20:33] crashed in in the uh uh uh at calvary in
[1:20:37] the cross
[1:20:38] so when christ was dying you were judged
[1:20:41] there
[1:20:42] you were sinner by representation
[1:20:46] and you are also judged by
[1:20:48] representation
[1:20:50] and justified by representation and rose
[1:20:53] again by representation
[1:20:58] hallelujah if what has first adam did
[1:21:01] affected us what the second adam have
[1:21:04] done also must be affecting our life
[1:21:08] [Music]
[1:21:09] [Applause]
[1:21:13] why do you accept the first adam and you
[1:21:16] don't accept the second adam because the
[1:21:18] first already because the the second
[1:21:21] existed before the man from heaven
[1:21:24] amen
[1:21:26] you want to condemn me for adam fine
[1:21:28] don't stop there put a camera
[1:21:30] you must finish your story you must
[1:21:33] bring the second adam and in the second
[1:21:35] adam i was also represented there
[1:21:39] in the first adam i was represented
[1:21:41] identified by death by the second adam
[1:21:44] i'm identified by life that i always
[1:21:48] existed and i will never be destroyed
[1:21:52] and i'm going back to my father
[1:21:56] amen
[1:21:58] death is nothing
[1:22:01] nothing to the believer
[1:22:02] amen
[1:22:03] he's already judged you when he judged
[1:22:06] christ
[1:22:07] amen the ordinance that was against you
[1:22:10] was nailed at the cross
[1:22:12] amen
[1:22:14] and you can't be under judgment no more
[1:22:17] christ took your judgment and when you
[1:22:19] are baptized into that body of christ
[1:22:22] you are free from god's judgment
[1:22:26] the wrath of god will pass over you
[1:22:30] that is why he said when i see the blood
[1:22:34] i shall pass over you so the one way to
[1:22:38] avoid judgment is to accept jesus christ
[1:22:42] and to be born again and him that
[1:22:45] receive the son have passed from death
[1:22:48] and to life
[1:22:50] never to come to judgment or
[1:22:51] condemnation again
[1:22:53] amen
[1:22:55] blessed be the name of the lord that's
[1:22:57] why the judge came with a white wig
[1:23:00] amen
[1:23:01] and when we came what did he say
[1:23:06] well if you turn the picture that decent
[1:23:09] look we know to the right right right
[1:23:11] you can probably see it from the
[1:23:13] audience it is crust
[1:23:16] see his eyes looking here just as
[1:23:19] perfect as it could be
[1:23:21] wearing the white wig of water
[1:23:24] supreme deity and water
[1:23:27] but it's not
[1:23:29] bringing us fear
[1:23:33] amen when esther sees the king she is
[1:23:36] not afraid
[1:23:38] she is married to the king
[1:23:40] she long to see her husband she long to
[1:23:44] see the one that she loves when the king
[1:23:46] comes she's happy she's not trembling
[1:23:52] amen
[1:23:53] because that supreme deity is the judge
[1:23:56] but when he sees us the queen minister
[1:23:58] what do you want
[1:24:01] amen the lord said do not enter into the
[1:24:04] king in a cult if you are not called
[1:24:06] esther enter there amen by law as they
[1:24:10] was condemned by the supreme church the
[1:24:14] king stretch the scepter and say i am
[1:24:17] the one who decide you're not gonna die
[1:24:19] you shall leave
[1:24:21] [Music]
[1:24:24] he can bypass that law
[1:24:28] hallelujah the supreme judge of all
[1:24:31] heaven and earth
[1:24:33] can you see his eyes
[1:24:35] nose
[1:24:36] his mouth just turned the picture from
[1:24:38] this the way the head this way and the
[1:24:41] way it's supposed to be he's supreme
[1:24:44] judge
[1:24:45] why is the supreme judge coming
[1:24:49] there is none other but him
[1:24:51] and that is a perfect identification
[1:24:54] again
[1:24:55] a vindication that this message is what
[1:25:00] come on
[1:25:02] this is the truth
[1:25:04] it is true
[1:25:07] amen
[1:25:08] that's why people attack the cloud
[1:25:11] because if they discredit the cloud they
[1:25:14] are discrediting the vindication of the
[1:25:17] message
[1:25:24] and making him not a third person but
[1:25:27] the only person with the white
[1:25:30] see you see the dark his face his beard
[1:25:33] and his eyes and notice he's looking
[1:25:36] from him come this light shining
[1:25:39] the right side
[1:25:42] so the judge when he's coming he's not
[1:25:44] coming to condemn you actually he's
[1:25:47] coming bringing light
[1:25:49] [Music]
[1:25:52] and bringing light to the right side
[1:25:56] who is on the right side what is the
[1:25:58] mystery of the right side who sit on the
[1:26:02] right side to him that will overcome he
[1:26:05] will sit with me on the throne
[1:26:11] hallelujah
[1:26:12] at the right side to which he is looking
[1:26:16] to so his attention is the right side
[1:26:20] and not only is he attentive to your
[1:26:22] life but he's bringing you also light
[1:26:25] yes
[1:26:29] sir queen esther what's going on
[1:26:32] what's going on
[1:26:34] it has been 30 days i've never been to
[1:26:36] the king
[1:26:37] now the king has come you have invited
[1:26:40] me i'm here what's going on
[1:26:43] amen
[1:26:44] the judge
[1:26:45] to which he's looking and on the cross
[1:26:49] that is where he looked
[1:26:51] to the right where he poured on the
[1:26:54] water
[1:26:55] in the light of his resurrection we
[1:26:58] still go forth in his water
[1:27:01] so when he came he's looking at the
[1:27:03] right side reminding you that i am
[1:27:06] giving the last grace to the
[1:27:09] predestinated seed
[1:27:11] i am coming from them
[1:27:12] [Music]
[1:27:14] you're bringing them light why
[1:27:17] zechariah 14 but it shall be one day
[1:27:20] which shall be known to the lord not day
[1:27:23] no night this morning but it shall come
[1:27:26] to pass that at the evening time it
[1:27:28] shall be water
[1:27:32] that's correct
[1:27:36] psalm chapter 119
[1:27:39] that word is a water
[1:27:42] a lamp unto mine
[1:27:44] and the water anti-ma
[1:27:47] so the light is bringing is the world
[1:27:52] [Music]
[1:27:54] he is the one who opened those hills
[1:27:58] he is those hills
[1:28:00] for the whole word of god is christ
[1:28:03] and christ is the seal that was open
[1:28:08] what is the opening of the seal then
[1:28:11] revealing
[1:28:12] cross and the very seven angels which
[1:28:16] represented the water
[1:28:19] the light of the moon shall be like the
[1:28:21] light of the sun and the light of that
[1:28:23] sun shall be like the light of seven
[1:28:26] days the light of paul the light of
[1:28:28] arenas the light of martyr the might of
[1:28:31] columbus the light of jewishly the light
[1:28:33] of luther all those lights put together
[1:28:36] amen and the seventh one was the new one
[1:28:39] that's why he was bursting like this
[1:28:41] looking at brother branham you still
[1:28:43] have one message one message i'm coming
[1:28:45] with it you already know this but i'm
[1:28:48] saying all six others were familiar
[1:28:50] because they were already preached by
[1:28:52] the messenger
[1:28:53] hallelujah
[1:28:55] he is
[1:28:57] and there is standing there supreme
[1:28:59] judge showing that he is alpha and the
[1:29:02] omega the beginning and the end what
[1:29:06] identification
[1:29:07] quickening power did that to us
[1:29:12] he's bringing light
[1:29:14] in genesis chapter one verse five and
[1:29:17] god called the light what
[1:29:19] that's why brother branham said
[1:29:21] recognizing your
[1:29:23] recognizing your light and his
[1:29:27] message recognizing your day and his
[1:29:30] message because the day was called light
[1:29:37] hallelujah
[1:29:38] so the first death struck the body
[1:29:42] the second death struck the spirit of
[1:29:44] the soul and the inner man
[1:29:47] the second death is the lake of fire
[1:29:50] death and here were cast into the lake
[1:29:52] of fire which is second death
[1:29:55] but the fearful the unbelieving and the
[1:29:58] abominable and the murderer and the
[1:30:00] whole monger the sorcery the idolater
[1:30:03] and all liars shall have their part
[1:30:06] this word part means time
[1:30:08] in the lake of fire which burn which
[1:30:11] burn with fire and brimstone we're gonna
[1:30:13] see this on sunday god's willing which
[1:30:16] is the second death so the second death
[1:30:19] is the lake of fire that destroyed the
[1:30:21] body and the soul but blessed are those
[1:30:24] that are in the first resurrection
[1:30:27] because those died in christ
[1:30:30] hallelujah
[1:30:32] let's go to the book of jude
[1:30:36] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:30:42] the book of jude
[1:30:46] the mystery of your origin
[1:30:53] remember the judge
[1:30:55] has the power
[1:30:57] to save and the power to destroy
[1:31:00] he's coming in decent time as a judge
[1:31:03] that's why he looked he said i justify
[1:31:06] you
[1:31:07] it's like you never done again
[1:31:10] in the first place
[1:31:12] that decision come from the supreme
[1:31:14] court with a supreme judge
[1:31:20] luther could give justification by faith
[1:31:23] but there was a mysterious part that was
[1:31:26] locked
[1:31:29] [Music]
[1:31:38] all right thank you sister
[1:31:40] [Laughter]

[1:33:20] that have been called

[1:33:38] because you're children of water
[1:33:43] mercy to you
[1:33:45] and peace
[1:33:46] because by reconciliation with christ
[1:33:49] paul said in roman that we made peace
[1:33:52] with god
[1:33:54] peace
[1:33:55] and what love
[1:33:57] this judge is not coming to condemn you
[1:34:03] he's looking at the right hand side
[1:34:06] because that is love

[1:34:35] verse 3 who
[1:34:37] he's talking to who
[1:34:40] beloved
[1:34:43] when i gave all diligence to write to
[1:34:45] you
[1:34:46] of the common salvation
[1:34:49] in other words i was getting ready urged
[1:34:52] to
[1:34:53] write to you about the common salvation
[1:34:56] and something happened
[1:34:58] what happened jude
[1:34:59] it was needful for me
[1:35:01] to write to you
[1:35:03] and exalt you
[1:35:05] that you should earnestly
[1:35:07] contend
[1:35:08] for the faith which was once delivered
[1:35:11] to the water
[1:35:13] jude is saying here that i was writing
[1:35:16] to you about the common salvation
[1:35:18] we all are believer i was trying to
[1:35:20] write you a letter
[1:35:22] but the subject i want to insert what
[1:35:25] i'm trying to speak under this common
[1:35:28] salvation is i want you to contend
[1:35:32] for the faith
[1:35:34] that was once delivered to the center
[1:35:37] amen because jesus christ says that
[1:35:40] remember the weak judge
[1:35:44] by importunity he went and did justice
[1:35:48] to the widow
[1:35:49] but when the son of man cometh shall he
[1:35:53] find what
[1:35:54] because faith was already in danger
[1:35:58] amen
[1:35:59] george begin to tell the believer hold
[1:36:01] on to that faith hold on to that faith
[1:36:04] because somebody is trying to destroy
[1:36:06] the faith but thank god malachi 4 was
[1:36:09] already prepared
[1:36:11] amen god already worked proactively by
[1:36:15] the time that faith will be restored
[1:36:17] there will be a gentleman in the end
[1:36:19] time that's going to restore the faith
[1:36:22] back to the faith of the apostle
[1:36:24] i shall restore say the lord
[1:36:27] what the god what what the the
[1:36:30] the the canker room the palm room all of
[1:36:33] them what they eat i won't restore
[1:36:38] jude
[1:36:39] why do you warn us about this faith
[1:36:43] what is going on
[1:36:44] amen
[1:36:46] verse 4
[1:36:49] you there
[1:36:50] yeah we good
[1:36:53] for there are certain men
[1:36:56] crept
[1:37:00] they didn't enter
[1:37:04] so when somebody's creeping you know how
[1:37:06] he's coming
[1:37:07] amen
[1:37:08] they crept unaware
[1:37:13] in other words in the economy of god
[1:37:17] in the field of god
[1:37:24] in the field of god
[1:37:26] there is a net filtration
[1:37:31] remember in matthew 13 we saw the sower
[1:37:35] going and sowing the good seed
[1:37:37] but the enemy waited when everything is
[1:37:40] dark
[1:37:41] then he slept unaware and then begin to
[1:37:44] sow the other seed so in the field of
[1:37:47] god there are two seed remember the
[1:37:49] origin
[1:37:51] ever clear
[1:37:53] and for thee there are certain men
[1:37:56] corrupting animals
[1:37:58] unnoticed
[1:38:00] these man that crept him
[1:38:03] let's see the origin
[1:38:06] you ready
[1:38:07] who were before old
[1:38:13] salvation appeared to whom
[1:38:17] but not all men have
[1:38:22] do you have faith you should be praising
[1:38:25] god
[1:38:25] [Music]
[1:38:29] amen don't play with your faith
[1:38:32] it is precious that's why jude said you
[1:38:35] must contend content means you must
[1:38:38] fight for it
[1:38:42] don't play with malachi 4
[1:38:44] [Music]
[1:38:49] amen it is precious to me
[1:38:53] amen i must fight for that
[1:38:57] i must complain for that
[1:38:59] i must stand for that
[1:39:01] for the message of the hour
[1:39:08] because the message of the hour is the
[1:39:11] restoration of the origin of faith that
[1:39:14] was lost through the edges
[1:39:17] and if jude said you must fight for it i
[1:39:19] will fight for it
[1:39:29] people play with the message
[1:39:32] amen these people were before of old
[1:39:36] or then to water
[1:39:43] do you have a different bible than mine
[1:39:50] brother when you preach this message
[1:39:52] he has a different sound
[1:40:00] [Laughter]
[1:40:02] hallelujah
[1:40:04] whoever before of old or damn to this
[1:40:08] condemnation in other words
[1:40:10] predestinated
[1:40:12] to be condemned
[1:40:15] come on
[1:40:16] ungodly man
[1:40:20] you there turning the grace of god
[1:40:25] into water
[1:40:26] in other words they have the power to
[1:40:29] pervert
[1:40:34] and the one who originally had power to
[1:40:39] prevent was the devil
[1:40:41] that's why when jesus looked at the
[1:40:43] pharisees he said you are of your father
[1:40:47] the devil
[1:40:48] these are children of satan
[1:40:54] but into
[1:40:56] the message group
[1:40:58] [Music]
[1:41:04] hallelujah
[1:41:05] denying the only lord god
[1:41:08] and our lord jesus christ he said
[1:41:10] brother stephen they all believe the
[1:41:12] message they all believe the deity hold
[1:41:14] on
[1:41:15] amen
[1:41:17] five i will therefore
[1:41:20] put you in remembrance
[1:41:23] i'm gonna stop in five
[1:41:25] then we dig into this
[1:41:27] then on sunday we pick up on six
[1:41:29] you ready
[1:41:31] i will therefore put you in remembrance
[1:41:34] what do you want to remind us jude
[1:41:37] your message is stand for your faith
[1:41:41] because they are infiltration there is a
[1:41:44] wrong seed that entered
[1:41:47] anywhere you didn't know they entered
[1:41:50] they are sitting
[1:41:52] some of them are even on the pulpit
[1:41:56] [Music]
[1:42:00] i'm responsible to this church
[1:42:03] they are also in the pulpit
[1:42:06] preaching the message
[1:42:08] but wrong seed
[1:42:10] [Music]
[1:42:11] to whom they were predestinated for
[1:42:14] condemnation
[1:42:17] amen
[1:42:18] remember the other one
[1:42:20] were completely unbelievers
[1:42:22] they were only good to you
[1:42:25] they didn't know because when jesus
[1:42:27] christ asked them
[1:42:28] when i was sick you came to see me say
[1:42:30] where where were you
[1:42:32] they were they didn't know they were
[1:42:34] just outside the message
[1:42:36] [Music]
[1:42:38] but they respected you but this kind is
[1:42:41] boastful
[1:42:43] it's very arrogant
[1:42:46] and proud
[1:42:52] you you need the omni the ammunition
[1:42:54] correct so when you shoo if you see it
[1:42:57] do you know how to shoot
[1:42:58] anybody clear
[1:43:00] all right let's go to verse five i will
[1:43:02] therefore put you in remembrance jude
[1:43:05] what is going on
[1:43:07] though you once knew this i know you
[1:43:10] know this but let me refresh this
[1:43:13] what do you want to replace
[1:43:14] how that the lord
[1:43:17] having done what
[1:43:22] can you look at the board the lord
[1:43:24] having done what
[1:43:29] okay
[1:43:30] let's see if this is there
[1:43:36] the lord
[1:43:37] having saved the people out of egypt
[1:43:42] not right away
[1:43:46] not right away
[1:43:48] he gave some time
[1:43:50] after afterward
[1:43:54] god did what
[1:43:56] can you look at the board
[1:44:01] the judge who can save him
[1:44:07] so when they are pulling
[1:44:09] people
[1:44:10] out of egypt
[1:44:12] there were a certain seed that
[1:44:14] approached to it
[1:44:16] they are entering
[1:44:18] so when the pool it's like a net
[1:44:21] it's bringing everything out
[1:44:24] it is up to the feature to sit now and
[1:44:28] open the net and begin to see who is the
[1:44:31] correct fish
[1:44:33] who is that rainbow trout fish that have
[1:44:36] a rainbow
[1:44:39] and who was a parasite
[1:44:43] hallelujah
[1:44:44] after having served the people out of
[1:44:47] egypt after all destroyed them that did
[1:44:50] whatever
[1:44:52] how did they follow moses
[1:44:55] but they didn't believe moses
[1:45:03] to leave egypt
[1:45:05] you have to put the blood on the lantern
[1:45:09] everybody
[1:45:10] these people follow moses
[1:45:13] so when moses said let's go to the right
[1:45:16] they went let's go to the left they went
[1:45:18] let's go to the right the left but
[1:45:20] surely in their heart they never believe
[1:45:23] moses
[1:45:27] [Music]
[1:45:28] do you follow me
[1:45:29] when jesus christ came he looked at the
[1:45:32] pharisee and he put a dna test and he
[1:45:36] put in a laboratory he said if you have
[1:45:40] relief moses
[1:45:41] you should believe me
[1:45:43] because moses spoke on me
[1:45:46] so just like your father rejected moses
[1:45:49] you are of the seed of your father that
[1:45:52] kills the prophet
[1:45:56] that destroy the prophet
[1:45:59] [Music]

[1:58:43] came which was ancient food because the
[1:58:47] message was brought by angels

[1:59:09] say they all stand up
[1:59:11] you say moses said they all stand up

[1:59:24] with the people in the message
[1:59:27] you say brother branham say

[1:59:36] you can show somebody five code 10 code
[1:59:39] this is the way brother branham say by
[1:59:40] the brand i'm saying
[1:59:42] and still they are still resisting the
[1:59:44] code
[1:59:45] and yet claiming to be believer or
[1:59:48] claiming to be preaching the message
[1:59:54] hallelujah
[1:59:55] discussing angel food

[2:00:12] our souls love this stuff
[2:00:14] and everything is what
[2:00:18] [Music]
[2:00:20] so everything in the message became
[2:00:22] wrong
[2:00:24] when you were eating that at the
[2:00:26] beginning you will sweet
[2:00:28] who caused you to disgust
[2:00:31] the message
[2:00:34] hallelujah
[2:00:35] our soul loved this stuff
[2:00:38] and this old manner that falls out every
[2:00:41] night
[2:00:42] why we would rather have some garlic and
[2:00:44] leak out of egypt you see the water
[2:00:48] was nothing
[2:00:50] for the water
[2:00:51] [Music]
[2:00:54] because they were ordained
[2:00:56] to a condemnation
[2:00:58] [Music]
[2:01:00] are you there
[2:01:01] are you there
[2:01:03] just as god the lord that brother
[2:01:05] branham there is a coral and death and
[2:01:08] that has been loaded also in the exodus
[2:01:11] to help pull that crowd out
[2:01:17] and destroy it
[2:01:18] [Music]

[2:01:43] if i touch you a methodist message it
[2:01:46] won't take no effect on you
[2:01:53] hallelujah so by causing you to disgust
[2:01:57] the manna they are actually blocking
[2:02:00] your breath and your progression
[2:02:03] because god
[2:02:05] identified each age with a message
[2:02:10] [Music]
[2:02:12] hallelujah
[2:02:14] this is goddamn if
[2:02:17] moses taught the message of noah it
[2:02:20] would take no effect
[2:02:22] if jesus taught moses message it would
[2:02:25] take what
[2:02:26] no effect because the
[2:02:29] predestinated
[2:02:30] seed are laying there
[2:02:33] that will
[2:02:35] only
[2:02:36] be watered by that type of water that is

[2:02:53] quicken
[2:02:55] that can make your heart burn
[2:02:57] except the message of the hour
[2:03:04] when they give you skim milk it doesn't
[2:03:07] taste good
[2:03:10] you put it in two minutes you hungry
[2:03:12] again

[2:03:25] must be the condition that grows it it
[2:03:28] must be the appropriate manner
[2:03:31] america

[2:11:52] you are eating the message not
[2:11:55] calmly
[2:12:01] you should eat the message
[2:12:04] in
[2:12:06] an uncomfortable situation
[2:12:11] that uncomfortable situation is the
[2:12:14] growing home
[2:12:16] it was the living of egypt going to the
[2:12:20] promised land
[2:12:21] that makes you nervous
[2:12:24] what else can we do what what what you
[2:12:27] you you want the expectation for the
[2:12:29] coming of the lord it make you eat the
[2:12:32] message
[2:12:33] you want to get it you excited you're
[2:12:36] eating it with all preparation anytime
[2:12:38] the lord can come i'm ready to go that's
[2:12:41] the way the message should be received
[2:12:44] [Music]
[2:12:46] not we sit in church and we sit like
[2:12:47] this like conference
[2:12:50] you finish and then people woke up it
[2:12:51] was good it was good
[2:12:54] it was good it was good
[2:12:57] the message was good yeah it was good
[2:12:59] yeah yeah he preached good
[2:13:04] amen
[2:13:05] there is no urgency
[2:13:08] there is no fear there is no enthusiasm
[2:13:13] to receive the word because somebody
[2:13:16] belittle it
[2:13:22] because some preacher belittle it
[2:13:28] you go read it a little bit you go home
[2:13:30] you read it a little bit you go 20 years
[2:13:33] in the message you ask one question they
[2:13:35] don't know this you ask this they don't
[2:13:37] know this you ask this they don't know
[2:13:38] you hack the basics of the message you
[2:13:41] don't know where were you under all
[2:13:43] these 20 years where were you under all
[2:13:45] these 10 years
[2:13:49] now when they bring something where is
[2:13:51] this coming from
[2:13:55] it was in the tapes
[2:13:56] it was in the book it was in the
[2:13:59] scripture
[2:14:00] but a mixed-melted
[2:14:03] a mixed multitude calls it amen
[2:14:07] yeah
[2:14:08] i gotta stop here this is too deep
[2:14:10] let's stand
[2:14:13] yeah
[2:14:14] if i get here it's another 30 minutes

[2:14:22] i thought i'm gonna finish this then we
[2:14:23] get the other one so keep it there in
[2:14:26] june chapter 5 and verse 5
[2:14:29] it says that after the left egypt
[2:14:32] two seed
[2:14:33] one
[2:14:34] was destroyed
[2:14:36] that did not believe
[2:14:38] what made them not to believe
[2:14:43] what
[2:14:44] because the scripture says here that
[2:14:47] the grace of salvation appeared to all
[2:14:49] men
[2:14:50] but not all men have what
[2:14:53] what makes this one not to believe
[2:14:57] amen
[2:15:00] let me see if i can get it you see what
[2:15:01] was loaded here
[2:15:09] let me see if i can get that scripture
[2:15:10] that i'm looking for
[2:15:20] go to deuteronomy 32.
[2:15:26] i want you to keep this in mind
[2:15:31] so you see my point
[2:15:33] there are certain men unaware that
[2:15:35] creptin
[2:15:40] paul spoke about them
[2:15:43] deuteronomy 32
[2:15:46] you might have to come back to this
[2:15:51] i believe i got the right tone
[2:15:53] the toronto me 32
[2:16:02] you ready
[2:16:03] verse 16
[2:16:05] they provoke him to jealousy
[2:16:08] with what
[2:16:11] how could you follow moses and have a
[2:16:13] strange god
[2:16:16] who calls that strange god
[2:16:20] we shall hate time
[2:16:23] amen
[2:16:24] they provoke him to jealousy with
[2:16:26] strange gods
[2:16:28] with abomination
[2:16:30] provoked they him to anger
[2:16:33] the sacrifice to devils
[2:16:37] how could you do that under the message
[2:16:42] not to god
[2:16:45] to gods whom they knew not
[2:16:47] they knew god that came up knew that
[2:16:50] came newly up whom your father feared
[2:16:53] not
[2:16:54] at the beginning you were not afraid of
[2:16:55] him you were not respecting those things
[2:16:58] now you begin to give more attention to
[2:17:00] that who caused it
[2:17:03] of the rock that father you
[2:17:07] you are unmindful
[2:17:10] and has forgotten god that form you
[2:17:13] you there
[2:17:14] and when the lord saw it
[2:17:17] he abort them
[2:17:20] because they of the provoking of his
[2:17:23] sons and his daughters
[2:17:26] watch verse 20 now and he said
[2:17:29] i will do what
[2:17:31] hide my face from them
[2:17:34] i will see what their hands shall be
[2:17:37] for they are a very forward
[2:17:40] a
[2:17:40] perverse generation

[2:18:25] later on they're still preaching in the
[2:18:27] message they are still among message
