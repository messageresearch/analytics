[54:58] through manifold Temptations amen
[55:03] amen that the trial of your
[55:07] faith being much more precious than God

[55:21] found unto praise and
[55:25] honor and

[1:09:55] on their Road up they start rebelling
[1:09:57] against the prophet and against the
[1:10:00] angel and against the God and against
[1:10:04] their

[1:10:12] multitude that went with
[1:10:16] them a mixed multitude came
[1:10:19] out they came
[1:10:21] out and when he did

[1:33:20] okay brother Bram says this he
[1:33:28] it has been a
[1:33:37] time let's look at two of these cases
[1:33:39] let's speak about the
[1:33:43] Hebrew that's what we are just about to
[1:33:46] speak
[1:33:49] about they could not bow down before an
[1:33:52] image
[1:33:54] God trusted
[1:33:58] them and when they
[1:34:01] learn that they have to go to their
[1:34:04] fiery
[1:34:05] trial they
[1:34:10] say whether God Deliver Us from
[1:34:14] theurn even though even if he doesn't do
[1:34:20] it we will never bow down before you
[1:34:23] your
[1:34:24] IM do you
[1:34:27] see they were sure and certain of
[1:34:31] God these are people that took a stand
[1:34:34] for the
[1:34:35] word they kept the word
[1:34:39] pure never want to bring filthy
[1:34:42] to even though they were far away from
[1:34:45] their their own land amen
[1:34:50] amen paragraph 49
[1:34:56] he knew that he was
[1:34:59] Jehovah they knew that God hear their
[1:35:03] prayer whether he comes or not in their
[1:35:09] place it is going to be for their good
[1:35:13] anyway so they only made their statement
[1:35:16] confess their
[1:35:18] sin and they move toward death am
[1:35:22] amen they move to
[1:35:25] death and let's go back to the trial of
[1:35:29] these three
[1:35:30] HEB once they were in
[1:35:35] the their God never let them alone to go
[1:35:39] andone in the fire god was there with
[1:35:42] them inside the
[1:35:48] furnace and this is what surprised the
[1:35:51] king
[1:35:54] this is what surprised King
[1:35:58] Nebuchadnezzar when you read it amen
[1:36:05] amen and then he took word when he was
[1:36:11] scared to see the face of the Fourth Man
[1:36:14] In The
[1:36:18] Fire these three Hebrew were also uh uh
[1:36:22] uh surprised to be the fiery
[1:36:27] furnace and they were inside the fiery
[1:36:30] furnace he seven
[1:36:32] times but they were surprised that
[1:36:34] nothing happened to
[1:36:36] them nothing happened to
[1:36:41] them they didn't see the fourth man yet
[1:36:46] amen the Bible didn't say that my Bible
[1:36:49] didn't say
[1:36:50] that that they saw the Fourth Man
[1:36:55] but there was a presence of an
[1:36:58] invisible uh before the the
[1:37:02] visible That You Don't See
[1:37:05] usually they had
[1:37:09] God they pray and fast and they were in
[1:37:12] order and they confessed their and they
[1:37:16] went in the furnace and once in the
[1:37:20] F God went there with them
[1:37:25] that's why even though they were
[1:37:27] hided nothing could happen to them
[1:37:32] why because inside of
[1:37:35] them there was a a devouring
[1:37:39] fire somebody who's called a devouring
[1:37:42] fire the almighty
[1:37:45] God the Creator
[1:37:48] God his name is also a devouring power
[1:37:51] he was there
[1:37:54] and in this urgent
[1:37:58] Time God never sent an
[1:38:00] angel God came down
[1:38:03] himself that's why when this King
[1:38:07] saw when the king saw that he was
[1:38:11] scared he didn't want them to be
[1:38:14] killed the king came down in the
[1:38:16] furnace when he came
[1:38:19] closer he be to call
[1:38:22] them with
[1:38:25] a sad
[1:38:27] voice because for him they were
[1:38:31] dead and he was
[1:38:33] sad and he called
[1:38:36] them and he heard the
[1:38:38] name he saw the Fourth Man and then he

[1:39:40] with the sword amen
[1:39:43] amen because that's his way that's how
[1:39:46] Jesus
[1:39:48] did you will notice in Jesus
[1:39:51] Cas when Jesus received the Holy
[1:39:55] just like when you gave your life to
[1:39:58] Christ it was not
[1:40:01] Jesus that went and Pok the
[1:40:05] devil it was the spirit of the Lord that
[1:40:08] led fill with the
[1:40:10] spirit after the spirit of God Came Upon
[1:40:14] and they took him to the Wilderness to
[1:40:16] tempt
[1:40:18] him and what did Jesus say he proved
[1:40:23] with the
[1:40:25] word that it's written it's
[1:40:29] written let's go back to the three
[1:40:31] Hebrews these three
[1:40:34] Hebrews their furnace hid it seven
[1:40:37] times in the
[1:40:39] furnace they didn't
[1:40:42] see they didn't
[1:40:44] know that God was with them in that
[1:40:49] trial just like you in your
[1:40:51] trial just know that God
[1:40:54] is there is an Invisible Presence That
[1:40:57] You Don't
[1:40:58] See let me tell you
[1:41:02] this from the
[1:41:05] invisible that's where everything was
[1:41:08] created it comes from the
[1:41:11] invisible if you want to live in this
[1:41:13] world if you want to
[1:41:17] overcome you must have the invisible
[1:41:19] close to you you must have God
[1:41:24] if you have a
[1:41:27] business or maybe you are
[1:41:31] married or maybe you are you have a
[1:41:35] job it is not your diploma or it's not
[1:41:39] your degree it is not your
[1:41:42] knowledge that can protect you in your
[1:41:45] marriage that can protect you at work
[1:41:48] that can protect you where you are or
[1:41:50] wherever you
[1:41:52] are not your
[1:41:54] intelligence that will protect you in
[1:41:56] your
[1:41:57] business you must have the invisible
[1:41:59] with
[1:42:06] you maybe when you go even into shopping
[1:42:09] in
[1:42:10] Chinese you will see their adults in the
[1:42:13] store that's their God of protection in
[1:42:16] the store how can you be a
[1:42:19] Christian you can go somewhere without
[1:42:24] God you just going to you going to work
[1:42:29] and then somebody take
[1:42:32] advantage wherever you go
[1:42:34] in you just go in just like that you
[1:42:37] just go in I mean physically you will be
[1:42:41] taken advantage of you will be tired
[1:42:43] because you don't have a protection you
[1:42:46] must go wherever you going with your
[1:42:49] protection and your protection is the
[1:42:51] Lord Jesus Christ amen take him wherever
[1:42:54] you going blessed be the name of the
[1:43:05] Lord let me read something in Psalm
[1:43:10] 127 Solomon was very
[1:43:15] spiritual very
[1:43:19] spiritual because when we speak about
[1:43:22] beloved sometime we don't
[1:43:25] understand and we don't understand what
[1:43:27] beloved
[1:43:28] mean listen to what Solomon
[1:43:33] say and by the grace of
[1:43:36] God if we can grab something from there
[1:43:40] blessed be the name of the Lord may God
[1:43:43] help
[1:43:44] us
[1:43:45] amen blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:43:55] Psalm
[1:43:58] 27 one and
[1:44:01] two and I'm going to explain it a little
[1:44:03] bit SP on
[1:44:05] it what the
[1:44:09] Lord because God want to help
[1:44:12] some to pull somebody out of a
[1:44:15] situation the Bible
[1:44:18] says a song of
[1:44:21] degrees for Solomon
[1:44:24] a song of
[1:44:26] degrees listen to that
[1:44:30] song except the Lord built their
[1:44:36] house labor in V that
[1:44:39] building you
[1:44:43] understand except the Lord keep the
[1:44:47] city The Watchmen waketh but in vain
[1:44:51] amen amen
[1:44:53] [Music]
[1:44:54] two and I will expand on
[1:45:00] it it is in vain it is vain for you to
[1:45:04] rise up
[1:45:06] early to sit up
[1:45:09] [Music]
[1:45:11] late to eat the bread of
[1:45:14] Sorrows
[1:45:18] listen for he giveth his beloved sleep
[1:45:23] that's right when you
[1:45:26] sleeping do you understand something
[1:45:29] when you
[1:45:30] [Music]
[1:45:31] sleeping some people get
[1:45:34] bread with
[1:45:36] Sorrows but for the
[1:45:39] Beloved God come when you sleep and he
[1:45:42] brings his
[1:45:43] bless how does God come
[1:45:47] down God come down at night why
[1:45:53] because the Beloved are in contact with
[1:45:55] the
[1:45:57] maker they are in contact with him in
[1:46:02] prayer when the day
[1:46:04] start in a true
[1:46:07] sense look at the
[1:46:11] government did you ever seen the
[1:46:13] government office working at
[1:46:16] night they work during the
[1:46:19] day why are they working only during the
[1:46:21] day
[1:46:24] because a night that's when they take
[1:46:26] true
[1:46:27] decision even those that are great
[1:46:30] politic they work at
[1:46:33] night magician work at
[1:46:38] night those that are in big position in
[1:46:43] government they are in great
[1:46:46] positions that the people wanted to be
[1:46:48] like
[1:46:50] them you will find out that a night
[1:46:55] they are doing things at
[1:46:57] night they doing all kind of dirty stuff
[1:47:00] at night they're going into ceter night
[1:47:04] they're doing things at
[1:47:09] night because God require worship
[1:47:13] somehow so they got to do
[1:47:16] something but you the
[1:47:18] Beloved what are you going to
[1:47:21] do you meet that
[1:47:24] person he will tell you with your God
[1:47:27] you're going to church you're just going
[1:47:29] to church you need to leave your
[1:47:32] church but he at
[1:47:34] night he doesn't
[1:47:37] sleep he's working at
[1:47:41] night in bad
[1:47:44] places just to give
[1:47:46] Glory or do a
[1:47:49] sacrifice or to do all kind of
[1:47:52] but you they didn't require you to give
[1:47:55] any offering all the offering is already
[1:47:57] the cross the Lord Jesus Christ is your
[1:47:59] offering the prayer is your offering
[1:48:02] amen
[1:48:07] therefore Solomon is
[1:48:11] saying if the Lord doesn't build a
[1:48:14] house in those that built
[1:48:17] it
[1:48:19] even Wherever You Are
[1:48:24] never say that my
[1:48:27] intelligence wherever you going
[1:48:29] everybody bring their God each person
[1:48:32] have their
[1:48:33] God
[1:48:35] El Let each person call on their
[1:48:38] God it means everybody have their own
[1:48:42] God but you who are your
[1:48:45] God it's the Lord
[1:48:47] etal when you call upon when you are
[1:48:51] praying you call him a night time you
[1:48:55] also God will bring
[1:48:58] his when you coming up in the morning
[1:49:01] you will see all doors wide open all
[1:49:05] doors wide open with
[1:49:07] Victor because the Lord already brought
[1:49:10] the blessing that's why the Lord said if
[1:49:13] he doesn't watch over the
[1:49:16] city even if you're building
[1:49:18] something you will work for nothing
[1:49:23] they will destroy
[1:49:25] it somebody will bech
[1:49:27] you you start a business they will come
[1:49:31] and uh rob you
[1:49:34] amen why because you don't have God but
[1:49:37] if you have
[1:49:39] God he's the one that watch over is he
[1:49:43] doesn't
[1:49:44] sleep nor
[1:49:48] Slumbers that's where we can put our
[1:49:50] trust into
[1:49:54] let me read something on the book of
[1:49:58] act paragraph the act of the Holy Spirit
[1:50:01] actually that brother BR preaches
[1:50:06] paragraph the Bible says
[1:50:11] this those that will teach righteousness
[1:50:14] shall Shine Like
[1:50:18] Stars like stars
[1:50:22] they shall
[1:50:23] outand Stars forever and Hallelujah
[1:50:28] brother it's a good thing to be a
[1:50:31] pre after all isn't it yes it
[1:50:36] is it's a good thing to be a
[1:50:41] Christian times may be
[1:50:45] hard God has not promised a flowy bed
[1:50:49] of but he has promised Grace sufficient
[1:50:53] for every
[1:50:54] trial that can hit you that's right yes
[1:51:00] indeed grace is
[1:51:03] sufficient not his on a
[1:51:05] flower flower bed of
[1:51:09] his but God
[1:51:13] promis grace to overcome in
[1:51:17] every when a cross gets
[1:51:20] heavy Christ promised to be with
[1:51:25] you when a cross get
[1:51:28] heavy when your cross become
[1:51:32] heavy say God promised to be with
[1:51:36] you that's why the three
[1:51:39] Hebrews because the trial was
[1:51:43] Heavy the fourth man came on the
[1:51:47] scene and he went there to come down the
[1:51:50] fire to protect his children
[1:51:57] same thing about Daniel if I can touch
[1:51:59] him a little
[1:52:06] bit if you go to the Book of Daniel 6
[1:52:09] verse4 I wanted to
[1:52:15] read he was accused because of his
[1:52:20] faithfulness and they could not find
[1:52:22] anything wrong with
[1:52:27] him nothing
[1:52:31] wrong he refused to dishonor his
[1:52:37] God he refused to cut his
[1:52:41] Fellowship because when
[1:52:43] you when you break the
[1:52:46] scriptures your fellowship is broken
[1:52:48] with God amen amen
[1:52:55] because they forbid him or to worship
[1:52:58] His God he says th one I cannot obey
[1:53:02] that
[1:53:04] law he widely opened his
[1:53:08] windows what was he
[1:53:10] doing during
[1:53:13] trials he was
[1:53:15] praying he was
[1:53:18] singing he was uh giving Thanksgiving
[1:53:21] amen
[1:53:24] amen that's what Daniel was
[1:53:30] doing and he was giving
[1:53:36] Thanksgiving and his enemy ploted
[1:53:39] against
[1:53:46] him they told the king that Daniel is
[1:53:49] not following the laws
[1:53:52] you will notice
[1:53:55] that the king didn't want to let him
[1:53:59] go because of the
[1:54:03] enemy because of the pressure from the
[1:54:08] enemy because the king already knew that
[1:54:10] Daniel worship a true
[1:54:15] God so he was cornered by the laws of
[1:54:18] the mid
[1:54:20] and but even though he let Dan go the
[1:54:24] Bible
[1:54:27] says that he didn't even go to his wife
[1:54:31] night he was actually
[1:54:34] praying he didn't even
[1:54:36] eat he
[1:54:39] refused when it comes to a child of God
[1:54:42] a problem of a child of
[1:54:44] God the king cannot
[1:54:47] sleep it's like when they brought Jesus
[1:54:50] CHR and the woman say
[1:54:52] [Music]
[1:54:54] P's wife say I didn't sleep because of
[1:54:56] this
[1:54:58] man leave this man
[1:55:00] alone but he was stubborn am
[1:55:04] amen so that was the king
[1:55:07] dasas and he came down early in the
[1:55:11] morning and he begin to call Daniel with
[1:55:13] a S Voice at Alliance then Daniel Dani
[1:55:19] Daniel and Daniel answer about oh King
[1:55:23] live
[1:55:25] eternally when the king heard the
[1:55:28] voice he brought him up of the
[1:55:31] tri but those that accused
[1:55:34] him
[1:55:37] the same people that put the trial that
[1:55:41] put the people in the
[1:55:45] trial you know for Shadrach M and abedo
[1:55:52] they say that they need to grab the
[1:55:55] people they uh they took those accus
[1:55:59] their
[1:56:00] children and put them back in the same
[1:56:03] place in the same place they put the Tre
[1:56:06] that's where the same thing with
[1:56:12] Daniel the king orain commanded that
[1:56:15] they took these
[1:56:17] people the accuser of your life the
[1:56:21] devil
[1:56:23] in the same fire in in the same de Lions
[1:56:29] then and then the lion killed and ate
[1:56:33] them you will notice these people went
[1:56:36] through
[1:56:37] trial after every
[1:56:40] trial you will find out that God highly
[1:56:43] exalted
[1:56:45] them the three
[1:56:48] Hebrews they become governors of the
[1:56:51] province amen am
[1:56:53] amen Daniel the same
[1:56:57] thing he begin to reign with the
[1:57:02] King to tell you that through every
[1:57:06] trial when God start a
[1:57:08] trial he's trying to bring you
[1:57:11] up he's trying to give you something to
[1:57:15] do to give you a
[1:57:19] responsibility that's what I'm going to
[1:57:21] touch it up now
[1:57:24] I won't be taking long
[1:57:27] anymore
[1:57:32] Joseph in Genesis
[1:57:36] 4141 39 1-
[1:57:41] 20 they sold him amen
[1:57:47] amen he was sold
[1:57:52] first headed by his brother his
[1:57:58] family
[1:58:00] 372 they put him in a
[1:58:04] pit imagine if he was
[1:58:07] you it's a trial am
[1:58:10] amen they took him to a strange people
[1:58:13] and
[1:58:14] sold he went to a city he didn't know
[1:58:18] anyone and over there they sell him even
[1:58:21] in Egypt
[1:58:24] and from there he goes to the
[1:58:26] prison I'm going quickly cutting stuff
[1:58:29] out amen
[1:58:31] amen there are many things that we can
[1:58:34] go through
[1:58:38] it I have not even touched why the
[1:58:46] trial and Joseph went through all these
[1:58:48] trials
[1:58:52] and the same for Jesus
[1:58:55] Christ
[1:58:57] Joseph underwent all
[1:59:01] the and he took them with
[1:59:07] joy sold twice hated by his
[1:59:11] family he was still
[1:59:15] happy James
[1:59:20] 1112 the Bible say blessed is who
[1:59:23] endureth
[1:59:24] patiently the Temptation we read that
[1:59:28] scripture because after the
[1:59:31] trial you will receive the Crown of
[1:59:36] Life the Lord the Lord promise to those
[1:59:40] that love
[1:59:44] him Jesus say in John
[1:59:48] 16:21 he's talking about uh
[1:59:53] the about a
[1:59:56] woman that when a woman is
[1:59:59] pregnant when he comes time for
[2:00:02] delivery she will go through pain she
[2:00:06] will go through
[2:00:07] trial it's a it's a test because she can
[2:00:12] die she is between life and death
[2:00:15] amen but
[2:00:18] once the baby is delivered
[2:00:22] forget
[2:00:24] all that's the same thing with us
[2:00:26] children of God when trial comes we are
[2:00:29] praying we are crying we are
[2:00:32] tormented but if you hold firm to the
[2:00:35] word of God God is there to deliver
[2:00:39] you God is there to bring you up to
[2:00:42] another
[2:00:44] dimension listen to
[2:00:48] this God will never test us the same way
[2:00:53] we don't get the same kind of
[2:00:58] testing because some are golden
[2:01:02] vessels some silver Vel
[2:01:06] some uh clay
[2:01:08] some
[2:01:11] brass that's why I
[2:01:13] say even
[2:01:16] your you don't have the same
[2:01:20] destination you don't have the same
[2:01:24] Destiny but we know that commonly we
[2:01:26] will hit Heaven one
[2:01:28] day but in our life we have our own
[2:01:31] destiny amen
[2:01:33] amen blessed be the name of the
[2:01:38] Lord that's
[2:01:40] why we won't go through the same
[2:01:44] fire meaning that we won't have all the
[2:01:47] same trial why
[2:01:52] because if you are a silver
[2:01:55] vessel you
[2:01:57] cannot undergo the fire of a gold amen
[2:02:03] amen blessed be the name of
[2:02:06] God
[2:02:08] Amen blessed be the name of the Lord you
[2:02:12] won't you won't take
[2:02:14] it you won't take it like a you will be
[2:02:19] burned but somehow you going to go
[2:02:22] Maybe by
[2:02:24] water so every person have his own
[2:02:29] Destin all as
[2:02:31] Christian we have one
[2:02:36] destination if you are
[2:02:38] converted there is one condition are you
[2:02:42] converted amen amen amen
[2:02:48] amen that's why we don't leave the same
[2:02:50] trial
[2:02:55] but once we are
[2:02:58] converted you will go through different
[2:03:03] trials I'm not talking about little
[2:03:05] trial I'm talking about big
[2:03:08] trials great
[2:03:10] difficulty
[2:03:12] suffering pains amen
[2:03:16] amen you think oh I'm going to get
[2:03:19] married it's a good thing
[2:03:21] into marriage trouble
[2:03:25] start you say oh if I get
[2:03:29] kids it's come trouble
[2:03:32] stop it's a
[2:03:34] trial but just know that God is with
[2:03:37] you to overcome that
[2:03:41] [Applause]
[2:03:43] Temptation the same
[2:03:45] trial because we don't have the same
[2:03:49] Destiny why Tri
[2:03:52] what is a
[2:03:54] trial trial is a time it's a period it's
[2:03:58] a
[2:04:00] season that come in the life of every
[2:04:04] human every child of God that is
[2:04:08] converted will have a time a
[2:04:12] period that will remove
[2:04:15] joy that will remove
[2:04:18] peace that will remove exaltation
[2:04:27] if you go to Genesis 41 verse1
[2:04:31] there the dream that the king
[2:04:37] had
[2:04:39] uh seven years of famine and and of
[2:04:45] Plenty because there were seven years of
[2:04:47] plenty and seven years
[2:04:50] of but there were other seven years that
[2:04:53] were waiting to grab everything to take
[2:04:56] everything all the Plenty out amen
[2:05:01] amen meaning that things come in
[2:05:05] season there is a
[2:05:08] period there is a
[2:05:11] time just as a definition of
[2:05:14] a have to come in each one of our Liv or
[2:05:18] each person here
[2:05:27] Because by the power you had
[2:05:31] yesterday by the power of
[2:05:36] yesterday that's when you get

[2:12:22] and at the end God blessed and everybody
[2:12:27] that went through was
[2:12:29] blessed there are many things we leave
[2:12:33] it God knows
[2:12:36] everything I want to speak about the
[2:12:39] season because I said that the a test is
[2:12:44] a
[2:12:45] season and during
[2:12:49] season there are people when they reach
[2:12:52] their season of
[2:12:55] blessing they forget the weaknesses amen
[2:13:00] amen as I spoke one
[2:13:03] time you were praying
[2:13:05] God God Gave You
[2:13:08] marriage God gave you your job you have
[2:13:13] it now you begin to get busy with those
[2:13:17] you don't come to
[2:13:19] church you don't want to be closer
[2:13:22] but look at the
[2:13:25] secret we read PSM 127 verse
[2:13:31] one it's God who bring the blessing when
[2:13:34] you
[2:13:35] sleep and you don't push too much
[2:13:40] effort look at the life of
[2:13:43] Jacob he was
[2:13:46] T it's not that was very bad
[2:13:51] was doing that was
[2:13:53] bad but look at the
[2:13:56] difference Jacob always close
[2:13:59] to when need
[2:14:02] water he bring
[2:14:06] water he used to talk to Mama too
[2:14:09] much you would
[2:14:12] notice in every
[2:14:15] relationship when you don't talk to
[2:14:18] somebody distance that come
[2:14:21] and then you begin to forget things even
[2:14:24] in marriage when you don't commune in
[2:14:27] marriage the devil get in
[2:14:30] between and notice
[2:14:33] now our beloved
[2:14:36] Jacob he always talked to
[2:14:40] Mama because he was in fellowship with
[2:14:46] Mama that's why Mama did what she
[2:14:49] did can you believe
[2:14:52] from the same womb two Nations
[2:14:56] trouble by the same mother one mother
[2:15:03] why Jacob always close to
[2:15:06] M and his mother
[2:15:10] prot he didn't have to make many he
[2:15:13] didn't have to cook any to get his
[2:15:17] Blessing to get the mama was there for
[2:15:22] because he always Clos with it's like a
[2:15:25] child of God when you always in prayer
[2:15:29] in fellowship with God can you
[2:15:31] imagine when you are fellowshipping with
[2:15:35] God you are always in God all the time
[2:15:39] in contact with God God will open the
[2:15:42] ways God will be with you God will open
[2:15:46] the doors the windows of Heaven to bless
[2:15:50] you
[2:15:51] that's why the children of God don't
[2:15:54] don't don't make a lot of effort because

[2:15:58] charge it's God who's watching over the
[2:16:01] city he he doesn't sleep he doesn't SL
