weekend you've been praying okay you didn't sing that song by any chance amen falling in love with jesus it's right perfectly in line with the sermon so it's the holy spirit and i appreciate that brother micah daley certainly you were praying too and your song fell in line right everything and brother john begin to speak about the oncoming service his love is our body my god blessed be the name of the lord [Applause] amen hallelujah we appreciate all the family members this morning remember we don't have visitors here if i say visitor then it's going to be maybe something different but we have family members here and we appreciate everybody here and we appreciate the lord for healing his people and for his deliverance it seems like the devil was after us but the lord delivered us from all our trouble amen somebody asked me a question and i don't know if probably there is more than one person who had that question when i mentioned about the blood of jesus christ that the bride was more valuable than the blood of christ so i'm going to read couple quotes so to make sure if somebody else had that question you have your answer amen in the message if you need those quotes you let me know we can send the mass text in the message the mark of the beast and the seal of god preached in 1961 brother branham say that thank you musician for everything and we pray now that you are you shall bless us another thing that i would do if i had in my hand tonight a glass just one drop of the blood of the lord jesus how i would hold it to my heart i'll be almost afraid to breathe but then father in your sight you have given into my hand a greater amen the purchase of your blood your church that you gave your blood for to save it amen so god value you too much to the point that he have to lay down his own blood just to get you amen in the message expectation brother branham said that i have often thought how i would cherish in my hand a charger in other words a plate that held one drop of the blood of that sun but i realized tonight i hold great in his estimation before me is the purchase of his blood that he gave his blood that these might become his amen so god didn't value his blood much he looked at you he looked at me he says i need to get this blood so much to the point that i don't care if i have to shed my blood upon this earth amen blessed be the name of the lord how many receive the reading on the text so you should be ready prepare for the sermon this morning let's go to the book of genesis chapter 42. i will pray i have been praying that you stay alert by the grace of god because we're going to dig into some territory i hate to see people sleeping in church so please try your best if you're sleepy you can go back there where the deacons are you can stand there but i don't want you miss something because when you get to the mouth of god the numbers and things you need to really stay there so you understand that amen everybody knows what number three means right perfection right number five grace right number four i keep it in my pocket for next time [Laughter] number four is the number of the earth which is deliverance amen i will give you a quote lord dwelling as we're moving down in the future number six the number of men number seven we know it's fulfillment of completion number eight eternity praise god number nine brother robert he always get me amen number 10 no 10 10 is a bad number and then number 12 worship all right praise god genesis chapter 42 verse 3. what we're preaching here is not something that we preach and you forgot you need to remember it's going to keep on building building building until one day the gravitational force won't be able to hold you here we're gonna leave and meet the lord in the air amen verse three if you dare you can say amen and joseph ten brethren you see now not 12 but 10 there were 10 brethren praise the name of the lord amen and brother branham say 10 is a carnal number amen and joseph 10 brethren went down to buy corn in egypt but benjamin somebody's phone is honor but benjamin joseph's brother jacob said not with his brethren for he said let's perhaps mischief before him we know that the children of jacob were 12. one stays in canaan one was joseph who was already gone now the one going into egypt to buy grain or corn or ten brother you might be seated let's drop to verse and they say your servants are water if you're sleeping shake yourself i believe brother wayne got your fire blazing so he can't be put up that quick and they said your servant are 12. 12 total which is a number of worship you already know that i already gave it to you here when they try by 12 it's a worship when they attend it's a trouble but when they went to egypt 10 of them went so they were going in carnality and they said your servants are 12 brethren the sons of one man in the land of canaan and behold the youngest is this day with our father and one is not one day they thought joseph was already gone probably dead but he was not dead yet and joseph said to them verse 14 that that is it that i spoke to you saying you are spies hereby you shall be proved by the life of pharaoh you shall not go forth from here except your youngest brother come here everybody clear amen you are ten here i need that eleventh one to come amen when the eleventh come then i know you're speaking the truth amen verse 16 send one of you and let him bring your brother and you shall be kept here in water so when they turn they're facing the prison amen they're going to be first prison joseph is telling them you take one of your brother and you send them back amen praise the name of the lord and you shall be kept in prison that your words may be proven whether there be any truth in you or else by the life of pharaoh surely you are spies verse 17 and he put them all into word in all the word prison into word how many days you see now and brother branham say when they say three days it is not really three days we found uh esther three days fasting for three days it seems like she fasted from the first day second day third day then the fourth day she went uh-uh she fasted the first day the second day then the third day she went there jesus three days and three nights we thought he was one two three then four no one two then three because four you reached the point of lazarus who was in the graves thinking but david prophesied that corruption cannot be found in jesus so if you put four days you're gonna break the prophecy of david amen now joseph put his brother how many days so according to our mind we're gonna say the first day the second day the third day then on the fourth day they came out brother branham say when they say three days it is not truly three days that's why you need a prophet amen watch the next verse and you're gonna see why you need a prophet and joseph verse 9 18 and joseph said to say to them duh i thought it should be the fourth day you see one key from william branham then you begin to [Laughter] and joseph said to them the third day oh my god there is a revelation here that i left honor but it's in hosea you're going to be revived in three days you remember that i left it the holy spirit is bringing that back to me i will send you the scripture by brother david if you remind me we might have to send the mass scripture okay jose i believe chapter six if i'm not mistaken in three days god will revive israel in three days amen the first the second the third day amen and joseph said to them the third day this do and leave for our fear god if you be true man let one of your brethren he was trying to send them to go there but he is now holding one of them back amen let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison everybody clear so nine are gonna go out one is gonna stay in prison amen you go carry corn for your family for the famine of your houses in other words joseph is telling them you came 10 people here amen that's a number that is a problem amen now i'm gonna send one of you in other words ten i'm gonna say i'm gonna hold one of you in other words ten minus nine equal one one of you is gonna stay here you came with a corner number and you are going with number nine remember that pretty good okay praise the name of the lord job to verse 24 and he turned himself about from them and wept and returned to them again and commune in other words spoke and communed with them and took from them who why did he take simeon so the one staying his name is what so simeon is the one that is staying in jail he's staying in prison he's holding the key of the prison of israel amen and to liberate simon benjamin must be revealed amen there is something in benjamin when he comes you take benjamin plus nine plus simeon plus joseph then israel is back again in 12 with worship hallelujah he took from them simeon and burned him before their eyes let's go to exodus chapter 17. please stay awake exodus chapter 17 we talked about the first banquet we're trying to get to the second banquet you need today so you can enter the second banquet amen exodus chapter 17 verse 1. you already read the whole verse we send this scripture ahead of time the whole chapter and all the congregation of the children of israel journey from what the wilderness what why did they call that sin they started from the wilderness it's a wilderness it's a desert it is called sin after their journeys according to the commandment of the lord and preached in what referendum oh my god so they move from sin all the way to referendum what is going on amen and there was no water for the people to drink in other words god sends you to a place you reach there there is no water did god make a mistake because david said that he leaded me in the to the steel water but now he's leading israel and there is no order hallelujah they got to refer them the the description of referendum is no water no h2o amen no order to drink job to verse five because you already read everything at home if you know in verse 2 the people chatted with him in other words the people got angry why are the people getting mad about the water why there is a key mystery to their anger you need a prophet verse 5 and the lord said to moses go on before the people and take with you of the elders of israel because the work of redemption need to be done if you remember in the book of ruth when they want to do redemption the elders must be there so god is trying to do a demonstration of redemption he needs the elders amen the elders of israel and your road everybody there wherewith you smote the river so not just your road but i want to remember you something that is connected to the road you take the road that you smote the river when moses smote the river he turned the water into blood amen we know by the scripture that the water is the multitude of people amen so turning water into blood is speaking about death everybody there it is different than jesus turning water into wine which is the baptism of the holy spirit flowing on the people amen so he's reminding him like take the road that you struck death praise the name of the lord and there shall come water out of it anybody clear let me go to verse five take the road your road where if you smote the river take in your hand and go behold i will stand before you there upon the rock in horrible we already talk about horeb you know horeb right you need to go to the unchanging pattern of god and you shall smart the rock so that's why isaiah said he was smitten struck by god stricken by god you shall smite the rock and there shall come water water so water was in refeedim are you following me but it was not a visible water the water of refidem was sealed in the rock amen so when david said he leaded me beside the steel water you need to find out if god sends you to a widow woman and the widow only have the last meal how can a widow with the last meal give food to elijah it's a third pool mystery there will be a creation of food to sustain both elijah and the widow woman that food was hidden under the seal [Music] hallelujah and moses did so in the sight of all the elders of what israel jumped to verse 8 then kim who so the first experience of exodus chapter 17 is god providing water to his people number one the people that were thirsty that were looking for water god first of all uh satisfied them with water from the rock everybody following me then the second thing in referendum still amalek attack amalek never attack israel before the water are you with me you must first drink the water of life then your drinking of water will lose amalek against you hallelujah stay in tune stay connected then came amalek and fought with israel in water only in referendum after israel have drunk off the water from the rock and satisfied then for some reason american amalek didn't come before amalek must come after the experience of redemption nine and moses says to joshua choose out choose us out man and go fight when it was time to produce the water for israel moses went and did the work amen moses struck struck the rock and he produces water ever clear then the people drunk water then that experience released amalek amen but when amalek is coming to fight moses doesn't fight amalek moses take the responsibility of amalek fight into the hand of joshua [Music] so when you drink the water of life you must make sure you have joshua with you because joshua will be the one to take care of amelia not moses hallelujah and moses said to joshua choose us out men and go out fight with family to moral do you see not the same day by the next day first day second day third day the first banquet but the second banquet on the second day hallelujah fighter malek tomorrow i will stand on the top of the hill with the road of god i thought it was the road of moses in my hand so joshua did as moses has said to him and fought with amalek and moses aaron and er went up to the top of the hill we already explained you this everybody clear jump to verse 13 and joshua disconfited amalek and his people with what the edge of the so joshua fight with a sword amen hallelujah amalek is destroyed with a sword you we know what a sword is right okay praise the name of the lord this conflicted amalek with the edge of the sword and the lord said to moses go back to verse 12 but moses hand were heavy amen and they took a stone and put it under him because as they were fighting the battle moses lifts up his hand toward god and as long as the hand of moses were out up joshua was winning the battle are you there but when moses begin to get tired because of the gravitational force something in you a spirit by water it's a natural earthly force your arm was made to hang down and when you wash your hand you defy the very laws of water i'm not teaching physics it's in the message amen it has to be supernatural it's against scientific against all scientific things for you to break the law of what gravitation it cannot be done unless there is something supernatural your arm will continually do what so the forces that were fighting moses was a gravitational force it was an earthly forces it was a worldly forces and when that worldly force take over moses joshua began to lose the battle father god i commit them in your hand they broke every scientific rule according to science gravitation hold your hand like he keep our feet on the ground according to the rules of her or in in the rules our hand could not raise because they're going downward because of the weight and gravitation hold them down but these people raise their hand it shows they got a spirit in them that can control their what so it's something that is overcoming amalek in the flesh everybody clear praise the name of the lord verse 12 then but moses hand were heavy and they took a stone and put it under him and he sat there on and aaron and earth stayed praised the name of the lord aaron and earth stayed his hand the one on one side and diade on the other side and his hand were steady until what until they sunset amalek is defeated on the sunset not on the third day but tomorrow on the sunset when the sun begins to set down that's when you beat amalek everybody clear let's go to roman 8 then we're going to pray a whole message has already been preached romans chapter 8 i must keep many of them the sake of time i believe you read it at home verse 10 let me skip some of them and if christ and if christ being you the what the body is what remember in romans 7 we found out that there is death they sin in the body everybody here okay the body is dead because of what that's why paul said when i want to do good something is in me fighting that fight comes after amen but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you we talked about the other man you remember and the inner man the flesh the other man is the one that have death and sin right here but paul is telling you if there is sad man have the spirit in other words if in your soul you are already sealed with the holy ghost are you following me if in your soul you already drank the water of rephidim amen then don't worry about the amalekites [Music] but if the spirit of him is it clear if the spirit of him that raise up jesus from the dead dwells in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also do what not your soul but what he is now dealing with amalek in the flesh amen it is the power of resurrection amen that power come to this on the success hallelujah we shall also quicken your water not your soul because the spirit already dwell in you amen you are on the fight only against yourself against the carnality of your flesh the last of the eyes the last of the flesh and the pride of life hallelujah it shall quicken your mortal body by his spirit that do what he were already redeemed from the soul therefore brethren we adapted not to work to live after death for if you live after the flesh you shall do what but if through the spirit do what they did of what you are taking america under control everybody amen you are taking amalek under control when your hands are against the gravitational force if you let the gravitational force the pride of life the last of the earth the last of the flesh begins to get you down then you be then the white dog begin to lose the battle hallelujah jump to verse 23 then we pray for not only day but our self also which have the what of what because the spirit is already sad make sense now even we ourself grown where it's the spirit of god that is grieved with everything that is going in the world amen grown inside ourself waiting for what to which what the redemption of what everybody clear the adoption will with the redemption of what then you are finished then the devil can do nothing amen now let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy father and everything and for everything you're doing for us lord we are committing this service unto the hand father your children some of them were weak in the body some were battling some were going through many trials and difficulties lord father but despite all of that they made their way all the way lord father waking up in the morning defying the laws of gravitation lord that tried to hold them on their bed and they stood father and they came to your house to listen to the lord father may move me completely out of the way may you still displace lord with the power and the anointing of the holy spirit may father your presence here neutralize and destroy every virus every germ every sickness every illness every infirmity may be completely destroyed by the fire of god father may lord you speak to us lord father touch our body and respond to our need lord as we committed unto the hand in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you you already been seated now we are dealing with part 12 of our sermon the title as we already know is that it's king a hazarist three feast and esther to banquet i will again remind you to stay awake amen we found out that there were three feasts that were made by the king the first feast as we explained to you that king ahazaris made a feast and when he made the feast he was the feast of the princes and the servant and we found out that the princes and the servant are israel they are the jewish amen and that feast was made for the jewish people which was speaking about the dispensation of the law which was a jewish dispensation everybody clear with me then on the second feast we found out that king ahazaris made a feast of seven days when he made that feast of seven days he spoke of the seven church ages which is now the gentile dispensation where god is going to the gender to look for a wife for his own name are you there with me and 20 was time for his wife to come up to him god sent seven chamberlain which was the seven angel that came down on sunset mountain in order to call the blood amen and that feast was characterized by wine which was the baptism of the holy spirit throughout the seven church ages because under the seven church ages the ministry of christ is the son of god which is the ministry of the holy spirit everybody clear so far praise the name of the lord then the third feast was the feast of esther and this feast happened when king ahazarez chose esther he unite himself in marriage with esther and the king made a feast for esther and that was the marriage supper of the lamb because we are joined here on the earth but we're going into our marriage supper for three and a half years which was speaking about the rapture going into the marriage supper everybody clear now when we finish those three feasts we started with the first banquet of esther ever clear and on the first banquet of esther we found out that there is not only two ones banquet but we have two banquets of esther and we found out that esther who have a time that she and the king did not meet together and that time was 30 days everybody cleared so far and 30 has the number three and he also has the number zero and we also explain to you that number zero is a circle which is speaking about eternity which is exactly number eight and number eight is the number of eternity because number eight have two circles which is speaking about the marriage about the groom and his wife when they get to married together they're coming from eternity and they're going back to eternity everybody clear so far press the name of the lord then when we look at that number three there was a mystery to that number three where esther fasted for how many days so she fasted from the first day the second day on the third day she went to the king and she approached the king so that the king can come on to her every clear so it was a coming of the king into the queen everybody clear now if you notice here we already have the seven church edges that are already explained here but for some reason they give us again the three last step of esther going to the king because we found out that in the book of revelation revelation 2 and revelation 3 speak about the dispensation of the seven church ages he spoke about the first messenger he spoke about the second messenger he spoke about the third messenger and all seven messengers but when we went in revelation 14 we found out that the bible made a size of three angels not the three beginning angels but the three angels of the last time which were speaking about luther wesley and pentecost because they were the three step of grace which was justification sanctification and what baptism of the holy spirit so just like in the book of revelation he first speak about the seven church edges then he insists on three last angel in the book of esther he spoke about a feast of seven days but he have to come back also and insist on the three last days everybody there three last step which we saw that he spoke about luther wesley and pentecost then there was a now pouring on azusa street it was the coming of the king into the queen but the problem was in azusa street when the queen came into the first banquet fulfilling the third day everybody clear heaven was there her man was happy hammond was enjoying her man was eating her man was drinking everything was fine in other words the outpouring of azusa street never bothered the airman everybody clear it is a pentecostal anointing it is an anointing that does not disturb the devil everybody there it is the anointing of the anointed one of the end time it is an anointing that you can play the instrument in the church and you can still live like a devil it is an anointing that you can prophesy and yet your life is unclean the devil is still happy the devil is still praying the devil is still comfortable in your life you can wear high heels you can have tight dresses you can expose your body but you can sing in the church like an angel that is a pentecostal anointing hallelujah if you are under this feast you need to come out amen we don't want a holy ghost that cannot clean your life you don't want a holy ghost that cannot change you you don't want a holy ghost that make you comfortable when you watch pornography you want a holy ghost that condemn you when you do something that is bad [Applause] everybody clear that's why we need to move from number three and we need to go to the second banquet because the second banquet put you on the eternity everybody clear the message came to tell you come out from among them my people come out from the first banquet because under the first banquet the devil is comfortable amen you need an anointing that will make the devil mad you need an anointing that the devil is not comfortable in your body in your wife in your house in your business in everything that you do you don't need the devil hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord brother branham under the feast of trumpet in revelation 11 speaking about moses and elijah he says their ministry will be the ministry of moses and elias calling to israel out of what jewish tradition just as the seven and your message called the blood out of what from the pentecostal tradition in pentecost you can wear pants they

you acting crazy on facebook and i got a report from the people and i have a proof from the people i'm gonna ask you humbly not to play the music we are not pentecostal we are the blood of jesus christ [Applause] hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord as we begin to move in our sermon brother branham says that all the plans of redemption all the names all the symbols all the worship all of the tabernacle all the wood all of everything in the tabernacle everything spoke of what so when you read the bible you see they're speaking about a tree it's speaking about jesus christ they're speaking about a cup it is speaking about jesus christ they're speaking about a word it is speaking about jesus christ the entire bible speak about who in the message christ is the mystery of god revealed brother branham say he who is he christ he is the principal what of the entire if you read the bible and don't see who in what every verse of it rather make sure the people on the stream see this amen every verse of it go back and read it again if you can see who in every verse of the bible then you read it again because you have missed what the bible is what according to brother branham the bible is who hallelujah he is there now remember this statement here brother problem is saying that the bible is what christ he is though i'm going to repeat it again the bible is christ he is the praise the name of the lord come on up in the message they're talking brother branham say we are not to come together to talk about the message that's a pentecostal anointing you just talk talk there is no life amen we come together to get in there the message is what the message when people when brother branham say the bible is christ amen now brother branham said the message is christ say amen hallelujah it's easier you pick and choose you don't pick and choose when they give you the lamb you eat what is inside you eat the liver you eat the boof you eat the fire you eat whatever is in the lamb you eat everything hallelujah if you watch the chicken at walmart amen you will see that there is several parts of the chicken missing there is no head there is no no feather there is no vasara there is no intestine everything is a chicken to eat you say well i don't want to eat the head of a chicken i don't want to eat the eyes of the chicken do you eat egg do you eat egg he said the egg the head of a chicken is there the eyes of a chicken are there the feather of a chicken are there you can refuse the chicken but you are eating the egg hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord let me go back again he says that the bible is working and the message is what watch what he says here brother branham said the message is what he is the over there he said the bible was what he is there the same statement how can the message be crossed and the bible be crushed are you awake praise the name of the lord in first corinthians chapter 2 verse 7 paul said that we speak in other words we preach we preach the word in what even the hidden wisdom of god so it is not a wisdom of god that you can look in the bible and see it it is a wisdom that is hidden hallelujah and it was hidden which god ordained before what the foundation is for the word and to our so if you want to reach your glory you need to be connected to the hidden wisdom everybody clear what is the wisdom of god hallelujah first corinthians chapter one but unto them which are called both jew and greek who the what and the what so now we found out that the wisdom of god is crushed everybody following me do you see this clearly so if you go back up there you have the word wisdom of god and the wisdom of god is who because christ is who in other words paul is saying we speak christ in earth are you following me the bible interpreting the bible amen are you following me then in romans 16 paul says now to him that is of power to establish you according to what if paul has a gospel william mary and branham have also his gospel and the water speaking the preaching of who the preaching of christ according to what of what which was kept since the word what everybody clear so paul is saying that when we preach christ we preach christ in mysteries so when you read paul you are reading a mystery are you following me are you following me [Applause] come on brother branham he said the bible is written in what where did brother branham get that [Applause] now you understand why brother branham said it where did he get it the bible is written in mysteries jesus thanked the father for it that he was wrought in what the whole world is wrought in what and their own and only the knowledge of god can do what so when you go to genesis 18 the bible says that sarah was advancing age she was stricken engaged she could not have children and when god told sarah you're going to have a child she laughs she said may i have pleasure with my husband if you notice elohim spoke about having a child but sarah spoke about having pleasure it is a mystery of marriage everybody ready because according to the original creation amen every species was created originally from the ground are you following me the woman was the only by-product that was pulled from the men and they all and all the entire creation they were the the animal the bird and everything else were melting only for one season and to have their children go to your marriage and divorce are you there the dog met for one time the bird was made for one time but the only difference is that the woman the woman can make any time are you there so when elohim came elohim was perfectly in love with the zodiac elohim said sarah will have a shout when according to the time of elohim is perfect but the woman that is already following sin says that should i have what for hell it is pleasure for elohim means one time one child and that was it hallelujah so when you read genesis 18 sarah is an old woman sarah cannot have children sarah doubted god you move down a little bit down the road i'll be malek so sarah i thought sarah was a drummer i thought sarah was an old woman i thought sarah could not have a baby i thought sarah said it's impossible to have pleasure are you following me but when i be me like saucer he said that woman looks freddy how can a grandma look pretty we speak the mystery of god we speak we preach christ in what a mystery when you read it you're going to read the story but when the prophet comes are you following me when the message comes the message shows you that something happened to sarah sarah became young again it is in the bible but it is silver are you there so when you are located you are unlocking the back part mind of the bible are you following me the logos of the bible the bible is god in printed form but there is a living god in the bible that living god is the message of the hour that's why the bible is crushed the message is crushed when you reject the message you are rejecting the bible are you there you are rejecting the bible because the message only brings you the hidden part of the bible and the hidden part is connected to the bible when you reject the message you actually rejecting the living word the logos amen you don't understand what you're doing you are rejecting the bible and you fall down in blindness of laodicea that's why in revelation 10 7 when the seven ninja sound the trumpet all the what per se are preaching all the what mysteries of god should be what so the message unlock the mysterious part of the bible and hand it to you the message is the bible reveal are you there the message is the bible reveal it is the absolute interpretation of the bible without the message the bible is a sill book hallelujah why do we have to understand this everybody ready are you still awake did i lose someone everybody is awake praise be the name of the lord now we found out last time that we spoke about jacob and rachel everybody following me now we found out that at the birth of benjamin oh my god where am i okay we found it we found out that at the birth of benjamin are you there you rachel died because rachel was a top of the bride that cannot be on earth at the same time that benjamin is on the earth so as we go back to the scripture the bible is written in what so when you read stories in the bible there are messages locked in this story amen there as a proof we read esther we found that that was speaking about the jewish dispensation we found the seven days were speaking about the seven church ages we found the feast of esther was speaking about the marriage supper we find many stuff that are locked in symbols in form in tap in shadow in mysteries and you need the prophet to unlock that are we following me are you back on that pretty good make sure you stay in tune when jacob left his home and he went to lebanon jacob met rachel when she met he met rachel something happened to jacob jacob went and spoke to his father-in-law about his daughter rachel rachel was a normal woman and she was beautiful and jen leben have not only one daughter he has two daughters but for some reason when jacob went into leban housing when he met rachel something struck the heart of jacob that which struck the heart of jacob is called love are you following me are you following me is anybody sleeping okay praise the name of the lord then jacob himself represented grace brother branham i was praying one day after reading the life of joseph in the bible and i thought such a perfect man abraham was election brother david if you can give me a little bit so i can lower my tone abraham was election isaac was justification and jacob was what ever clear in the identified masterpiece jacob which means so planter and that is a deceiver and we realize that jacob's life really represented what because he was the grace of god all the time everybody there grace move into the house of lebanon are you following me is everybody in june the grace of god left abraham left isaac and went into a gentle end and the grace of god moved into the house of lebanon remember last time lebanon was a type of what denominational preacher the grace of god came when some of you were in denominational church are you following me then the grace of god came but grace cannot move without love first love must come and love make way for grace in the message divine love what is it when divine love is projected sovereign grace do what and he has to in other words when love starts then grace take over are you following me hallelujah so jacob when he spoke to lebanon he said my my uh my uncle i love your daughter and i'm gonna work for how many years when we begin to get in numbers in the bible that's why you need a prophet brother branham says there has been threefold there has been threefold purpose in all these things that bring us back to a three and seven again seven seals seven vows and so forth you can go seven church edges seven plague and all of that and now in trees number three amen in threes and sevenths is god's number in his mathematics of revealing his so when you see three in the bible seven in the bible something is luck ready why didn't jacob say i'm gonna work for eight years why he didn't say i'm gonna work for three years why he didn't say i'm gonna work for 11 years or two years or one years he chose seven years remember jacob was a prophet is everybody awake i'm going 35 miles an hour before i take off everybody clear now brother the bible says here in genesis 29 you can see the home and leban had how many daughter brother stephen you preaching esther what does this have to do with fester are you ready just stay in tune if you're sleepy wake up stand up on uh back there and levin had two daughters the name of the elder was who so when we look at the daughters of jacob the first one that was born was leah let me raise this a little bit we're going to come to that the first daughter that appeared on the earth i was on earth from lebanon was leah everybody clear and the name of the younger one was who so rachel came after by birth everybody clear verse 17 leah was standardized in other words when you get in check of housing and you see leah coming out there is one thing from leah that's going to strike you it is only heist amen you will see a woman walking but if you leave the house of jacob and you go back to your house and somebody asked you a question did you see jacob elder daughter you say yes oh the one that had tender eyes amen everything you remember about leia tenderize soft eyes amen hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord amen but rachel was beautiful and well feathered she has the favor like esther everybody clear so when they say yes but what about the younger one oh my god she's gorgeous she is beautiful you can see her so when you talk about rachel you gotta talk about her whole being you cannot just say esther hair you say man esther is beautiful if you look at her hairway her way of walking the way she talked everything is just gorgeous what about leia her eyes are you there and jacob loved who jacob didn't love leia his love was in leah in richard jacob wants to come jump the first one and go straight to leah and to get leah straight to rachel to get rachel jumping leah and jacob loved rachel and said i will serve these seven years for rachel thy younger daughter verse 20 and jacob served seven years for rachel and they seemed unto him but a few days for the love he had for her so it was a great love that seven years seems like it's two days when he sleeps he raised he just dreamed rachel when he's going he's just thinking about rachel sometimes he hit the tree wait a minute what were you doing i was thinking about rachel he was a strong lover what about leah oh she's okay are we there now we found out a mystery here that there are two churches are you following me a woman in the bible stop what everybody clear so we have two churches here everybody follow me the first one is rachel which is the younger are you there and rachel her name means a you a you is a female sheep are you following me that's why when jacob come when grace is coming grace is looking for a wife but that was must be a lamb on the female version are you following me are you following me praise the name of the lord hallelujah now rachel hello the daughter was liam the bible just told us that rachel was what beautiful and well favored everybody clear but liam esther which i just explained to you is a part of the bride just like esther rachel is the brother she's the one who is the female sheep because when god created adam he created adam male and female so jacob was looking for his female party are you there are you there that's why the bible said and the lord said it is not good for adam to be what everybody clear he was not adam and steve it was adam and eve are we clear so when jacobs come the woman that struck her is richard the one that have the name of his female sheep so rachel speak of your brother because she was well favored just like esther when people saw her esther was what were favored everybody clear you understand the first church but when you look at leah the only thing you remember about leah is only the tender eyes of leah leah have soft eyes when you see leah her eyes is like they are tired are you there when you see me her eyes are weary when you sit here her eyes look like somebody that is under the anointing brother branham help me in the message that breached between the seven church churches brother branham said the as means what singing means what stay awake i told you from the beginning are you there means prophet or what christ the mystery of christ is revealed in his own word down through the edges we start off from the foundation from the first church age he's talking about the church amen when the seed went in the ground the complete seed then he come through the feet defeated who come back through wesley we go in there in the chest then into the pentecost of the what and what speaking in tongues everybody there now it is in the word which means what everybody clear malachi falls so the ice speaks about prophet are you there so when you look at mia the only thing that attracts your attention to leah is the prophetic anointing upon leader that's why her eyes are like wee-wee are you there are you following me are you following me praise the name of the lord hebrew 1 1. did you get it let's go god who had said your time brother robert is about to jump and davos manny spoke in the past unto the lord who was the father's the old testament the jews are you following me israel are you following me he spoke to the father by what are you following me so the first woman that was birthed from jacob is a type of the old testament church are you following me are you following me the old testament is born before the new testament rachel comes second layer comes first and the characteristic of the old testament church is what david can you pray can you say can you can you go with me david a prophet abraham prophet noah prophet ezekiel isaiah jeremiah nathan samuel the whole church are you there are you there the old testament church is based upon prophetic anointing that's leah everybody clear did i lose anyone praise the name of the lord the prophecy came not in what not new time by the will of men but what who are holy men of god everybody clear holy man of god speak as they were moved by the word everybody so the eyes of leah spoke about the dispensation of the law are you following me hallelujah but that dispensation have how many years jacob want to work for what by working with leah for leah jacob by working for rachel the first seven years he didn't know he was working for leia in other words grace was under the law but grace was locked they started out really with grace to begin with jacob before they heard the lord they had grace are you there because when it was the day that jacob must take rachel he went to bed he woke up and he was lia he got mad he went to his father-in-law he said why did you give me leah his father-in-law said no there is a law you must go through the elder you must go with leah first you must go under the dispensation of the law first before you move to the dispensation of rachel [Music] are you following me did i lose anybody are we okay brother bottom say wow they were in egypt without law no one down there was just the priest and so forth but they didn't have any laws the law had not yet been given grace provided them a prophet which was moses and also grace provided an atonement the sacrificial name everybody clear the atonement had been provided before there was any law grace jacob was before doing what so when he was working he was working for leah are you there grace was before the there was during the law and afterlaw there also there was joshua representing what was right along with law but could not be enforced as long as law was in its proper place are you there even though jacob was christ working into it they lock him they say you can't get richer because you must go by the law the law the first born is israel you must go through israel first before you get to the gentile brand everybody clear so far so it's speaking there speak about the jewish dispensation and that dispensation have how many years praise the name of the lord brother branham in the water of separation the seventh different streak represented the seven church ages israel natural and the gentile in what seven church edges just exactly though israel had how many that's why jacob worked seven years for leah everybody following me let me go again the second one in the patmos vision one of these days i shall bring up and show you that israel had what two and tap exactly with what that's why it took seven years for leah and when leban spoke to jacob he said you must work again how many years seven more years for who which now is the seven churches of the gender everybody following me praise the name of the lord when you look at the children of leah is everybody tired praise the name of the lord when you look at the children of leah because both leah and jacob and rachel produce children unto jacob but if you look at the first four children of leah because leah had the first child the second child the third child the fourth child and her womb was closed and we just saw that leah represented the old jewish church which characteristic is the prophet the prophetic anointing we speak about the dispersation of the law the first child of leah was reuben brother branham helped me now reuben was the man he was the first one the weakest of the bunch everybody following me didn't jacob say in genesis 49 ruben that i'm a first of my strength the first of my strength but like water you went up on my couch and he found my couch he went and slept with his father's concubine and lived with his father conquered that is the immoral of what human being the immoral of human being was expressed unto ruben which came from leah are you following me hallelujah in romans 7 paul said i did not sin did you read your romans 7 except when the law came out are you there and sin taking occasion by the law are you there because the law came to magnify sin nobody knew the word adultery nobody knew the word stealing people were doing they look came and begin to say this is stealing this is lying this is cheating this is this the law leah the dispersation of leah exposed the immoral of human under ruby are we awake are we awake praise the name of the lord the animals don't have their memories the lion none of these things has that but the man run with the next man wife and so forth that's the immoral that is produced through the dispensation of leah that's when these the sin is coming because men sin in the garden of eden and sin was hidden so god sent the lord to choke sin so that there's law can make sin appear on the same so he can destroy it every kid the second child the second child of leah was who anybody clear in our reading we found out that the bread and that one to jacob were how many brother branham 10 is there what a bad number that's right to start with 10 is a bad number they had 10 tribes and them was just all what everybody clear anybody care paul said that i was sold under the law are you there he said they call no mind is what enmity against who because under the law that's when the carnal mind was expressed are you following me then when the tribe of israel saw joseph joseph went to the gentile which is a type of jesus christ going to us and the jew were locked up under the law the jewish people up to today are still under the law they still follow the dispensation of moses when they approach christ when they approach joseph they are approaching with carnality everybody following me under the dispossession of the world and the law josephine christ put them in prison are you there and brother problem say the law is the one that put you in jail lord help me let me go right here when he put them in jail he put them in three days because according to hosea chapter 6 israel will be redeemed in what because they are still under the law everybody follow me now when joseph requested benjamin he taught them that none of you go one of you stays the one who stays in the priest on his name is who are you there but none left what is number nine brother branham there was three watches the first watch started from nine until twelve the second watch started from twelve to three the third watch of the night was counted from three to six mysteries brothers now we got three three threes which is what imperfect everybody follow me so when joseph sent them he sent the tribe in imperfection because the law could not bring anybody unto perfection are you following me so simeon must be kept in jail and to liberate simeon you need benjamin and to have benjamin you need moses and elijah to bring the seventh seal to israel to bring perfection back to israel and bring the tribe back to number 12 which is worship because the true worshiper who worship god in spirit and in did i lose anybody no flesh can be saved by keeping the law the law was only here the lord didn't have any remedy the law was the word that's why they keep sinning everybody that's why they keep simeon you need a prophet are you there the law was god policeman that put you in what that's why they keep simeone the child of leah you stay in prison because leah is the dispensation of the law pull me simply on him are you there the third child was liver who produced the levitical priesthood under the law in christ the levitical priesthood died in calvary he came from leah hallelujah and judah also came from leah galatian 4 4 but when the fullness of time was come god said his what who was that son jesus christ made of what made under there are you there because i'm the judah came the melchizedek priesthood but christ must be born under the law and the leader are you there to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of what leah shielded ruben immorality sprung up by the law simeon speak about the law putting you in jail liver speaking about the priesthood of levitical priesthood and judah christ born under the law to redeem you from the law leah is the dispensation of israel of the jewish dispensation which if you'll read between the line leah is your first feast of king hazaris hallelujah hallelujah are we awake are we okay did i lose anybody if you have any questions see me praise the name of the lord when we look at rachel that work seven years for rachel and rachel produce one child his name is what joseph means what perfection i already gave you the quote ephesians father husband love your wife even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify the church and cleanse it the church with the watching of the world by the word that he may present it to himself a glorious church everybody not not having what perfection oh what if you notice there is two words the first word is spot blessed be the name of the lord i thought i will go quickly but it looks like it's a steak the first dime is spot anybody following me i have not even gathered into what we read the second one is what wrinkle spot speak of sin everybody there sin that affected your soul which is the enemy everybody following me wrinkle affect what your body which is the outside man so let's go back now and read it can we read it back now with the eyes of a prophet now let's go back and read it he will present to himself a glorious church not having spot or not having sin no wrinkle we're gonna have a change of the body it's the redemption of the inside man and the redemption of the outside man meaning that when we're gonna meet christ in the air we're gonna have glorified body a body with that sin and without rico because because we're gonna be younger again the wrinkle will go away a body with that spot which is the first water that comes from the rock take away your spot because it's the washing off the what the washing of the what remember when moses struck the rock what came it's washing you off first and then when amalek come it's taken care of though because the body is with death that's why we're gaining age we get gray hair so paul is telling you that he's gonna take off your soul and christ is working on you washing you by the word and when he wash you he's gonna present you to himself and when you're gonna see him not sin in you and you're gonna be young again that's what paul is telling you everybody there and that ministry commander rachel because he birthed perfection everybody clear presented to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing whatever is connected to it but that it should be what and with that what perfection comes under richer everybody clear everybody clear so your first feast of king of hazaris which is the dispersation of the law is leah did you get it your second feast of king a hazaris which is the feast of seven days of the gentile is your rachel now i'm back to western make sense now where is the third feast of king nehrus are you there when gretchen got pregnant the second time he was pregnanted with benjamin [Music] then benjamin at the birth of benjamin rachel died going to the rapture leaving the earth there was a departure of rachel from the earth going into the marriage supper which is the third feast of king hazaris everybody fear because benjamin the hundred and forty four thousand must be revealed leah the first king feast of king hazarus rachel the second fist of king of hazaris and then the death of rachel removing her from the world taking her into the presence of the lord is the rapture of the church because the church reached perfection they're going into the rapture without spot or blemish into the marriage supper which is the third christ of king a hazard and benjamin is revealed to the jewish people but the key falling in love with jesus sister victoria falling in love with christ do you see your son it was jacob falling in love he was grace falling in love he was crushed falling in love but to redeem rachel you gotta go through israel you gotta go through leah and then you can pick up rachel seven years first and then seven years first and then rachel have to depart everybody clear so far [Applause] let me see where we are okay is everybody okay if you feel you tell me we stop here if you okay we move on you okay shake yourself because we're getting into something different in our reading today we found in exodus 17 can i raise this that israel left the wilderness of sin hallelujah lord there was a wilderness called the wilderness or the desert the wilderness of sin that word didn't appear there by any chance it's a wilderness of s-i-n and we know sin is what everybody clear israel departed from the wilderness of sin before we move on let me say this i believe that all of the old things was the top of the new to come what israel was in there we are in the so when we are talking about this journey here this is what happened to israel naturally speaking but to us it is applied spiritually everybody there because we were born in what we were born in the wilderness of sin [Music] everybody shaping what we were in the wilderness of sin coming into the world speaking what under the wilderness of sin spiritually application spiritual application what israel was in the natural we are in the spiritual god lives so yeah naturally was what he's doing for us today what spiritually praise god so israel moved from the wilderness of sin we all were born in sin shepherding iniquity somewhere in a nightclub some were cheating some were gin drug some were smoking some were drinking beer or candlestick born in the wilderness of sin amen bear land of sin amen then the bible says that israel moved from there until referendum anybody following me they moved up to there onto a place called refining if you look at this like this it seems like israel moved from here all the way to here but there is a mystery anybody there the mysteries in number 33 these are sermons when you get a chance go home sit quietly maybe on monday tuesday put it back again and the holy spirit will continue to unfold because it's loaded everybody clear now number 33 verse 12 and 14 sometime i'll do this to help you have a break instead of you going through the bible you can go home and pick up the scripture at home number 33 verse 12 and they took their journey out of the wilderness what everybody awake come out and in camp in what so they never they didn't go straight from here all the way here everybody following me now they move from the wilderness of sin into a place that is called dafta hallelujah at the opening of the seventh hill the bible became anew and they departed from devka and he camp into what alas everybody clear now you see your mystery and then they removed from a lush and encamped into what look at the characteristic of resident where there was no water for the people to what but the water was hidden in a rock no water to drink no water yes brother michael amen so now based on the scripture we understand now that the journey of israel moved from wilderness of sin burning sin sharpening it quickly coming into the word speaking lies we moved to dharfka what does he mean because sin we know then from davka we go to a loss from a lush we go to work for them and we already explained to you that the first place that we start our journey we are starting from sin born in sin sharpening iniquity coming into the world speaking life that's when we start we are preparing you to deal with amalek with him are you there then from there we move into a place that is called daftka davka means knocking everybody here you get into a stage in your life that god begin to knock in your heart [Music] everybody following me because we are in the edge of laodicea and love this we saw christ on the outside what was christ doing everybody there trying to do what to get back inside so he can sup with you because jesus christ said we will come and we will sup with you everybody everybody clear so after you are in sin you are in an iniquity you are in the mud of sin living all kind of uncleanly life suddenly the gospel comes and you feel like somebody is knocking somebody is calling you somebody is pulling you you reach the stage of dothka anybody there then the preacher preaches and they say who want to accept jesus christ who want to come to the altar then probably you raise your hand you say i want to give my life to christ and when they do that they pray for you you come at the altar they pray for you the sinner repentance prayer you give your heart to the lord then from there on you are baptized and you are part of the church you move from there from davka to a loss a lush means a crowd of men you enter the congregation everybody following me everybody following me brother brother that is the sinner comes to hear the word faith cometh by hearing after he hears the word then he become into the fellowship of the church you get into a loss you are part of the church now we call you brother at the beginning when you came here we say who's that man today over there when you give your life they baptize you you begin to come to church we begin to call you brother because you reach a loss you are in the church amen and after he hears the word that receive it then you baptize him christian baptism and that brings him into what a loss then he gets out there in the water everybody clears so far then after you reach the step of a lotion then that's when you leave and you get into refuge everybody following me refugee means there is no other there but the uh the meaning of uh refedeem there is a message there the meaning of referendum i'm going to tell you the first first of all the characteristic of referendum is that there is no order one israel which this place called referendum and there was no other israel command against moses how many reads does chapter 17 you know what i'm talking about everybody clear israel got mad against moses israel began to murmur to chad with moses amen the reason why they were chatting with moses was because of
