TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Brother, why am I going to withhold you for something that is good? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I will preach it to you. &gt;&gt; I say put faith to work. &gt;&gt; Ask God forbid things, but when it's wrong, let also come back and say that is not. &gt;&gt; That's right. WE ARE NOT HERE TO PLEASE THE CONGREGATION &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE ARE AFRAID IF WE PREACH AGAINST CHRISTMAS we will lose half of the congregation. &gt;&gt; WE GOT PRESSURE FROM OUR FAMILY MEMBER. THEY WANT TO do Christmas tree. So the pastor is silence. &gt;&gt; He's avoiding to touch it BECAUSE HE WILL TOUCH HIS OWN FAMILY member &gt;&gt; in Christmas. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's not the case, my friend. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. If you call a pastor, make sure God call you. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE A PASTOR MUST speak the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; REGARDLESS OF THE PERSON, &gt;&gt; A PASTOR MUST SPEAK THE TRUTH REGARDLESS OF WHO IT IS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; OR WE HERE FOR PAYCHECK. &gt;&gt; NO. &gt;&gt; WE HERE FOR MONEY OF STUDY. NO. &gt;&gt; AND PEOPLE SOUL ARE DYING. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THEY CALL ME SOMEWHERE. I WENT SOMEWHERE. I SAT. THEY PUT A CHRISTMAS TREE. &gt;&gt; I say I'm sorry. I'm going to go to another corner. &gt;&gt; I don't even want to sit beside that Christmas tree. &gt;&gt; Because I don't want people to TAKE A PICTURE AND SAY, "HEY, I SAY LET me stay away the Christmas tree. &gt;&gt; I KNOW THE DEVIL. I KNOW THE DEVIL." &gt;&gt; RIGHT? I know the devil. &gt;&gt; I know the devil. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; This is the only sermon you're getting today. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; CAN WE CONTINUE? THAT IS AN OASIS FOR WHAT? &gt;&gt; DEVIL'S A DEVIL'S EXCUSE. &gt;&gt; YOU WANT TO GIVE SOMETHING, IT IS &gt;&gt; YOUR life to Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Give what? &gt;&gt; Your life TO CHRIST. DON'T GIVE TO ONE ANOTHER. &gt;&gt; UHHUH. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; MY BROTHER PREACHER, MY BROTHER PASTOR. &gt;&gt; UHHUH. &gt;&gt; SIT DOWN AND CONSIDER &gt;&gt; YOU ARE MAKING CONFUSION IN the church &gt;&gt; and confusion all over the world &gt;&gt; because of trying to please people &gt;&gt; because of trying to hold people in the church. We got so much mess in this message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Church become families. &gt;&gt; Church become racial issue. &gt;&gt; The pastor is a black man. &gt;&gt; So let's take our children there. So our children will go under a black environment. Nonsense. &gt;&gt; THE PASTOR IS A JAPANESE. &gt;&gt; Let's take our children there so they can go in an environment of Japanese. The pastor is an African. &gt;&gt; Let's go to AN AFRICAN CHURCH. LISTEN, DON'T COME HERE BECAUSE I'M an African. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; PUT ME ON TIK TOK. &gt;&gt; DON'T COME IN THIS CHURCH BECAUSE I'M AN AFRICAN. &gt;&gt; COME HERE BECAUSE OF THE WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; DON'T COME HERE BECAUSE I'M A CAUCASIAN. &gt;&gt; DON'T COME HERE BECAUSE I'M A BLACK MAN. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THROWING THE BRIDE IS THE WORD. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. It's the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; MY CHILDREN ARE CAUCASIAN. WE GOING TO A CAUCASIAN CHURCH. MY CHILDREN ARE BLACK. WE GOING TO A BLACK RACIST. AND I SEE THIS EVEN IN AFRICA. EVEN IN AFRICA, &gt;&gt; YOU SEE IN AFRICA, WE GOT TRIBAL CHURCH. &gt;&gt; THIS TRIBE, EVERYBODY FROM THIS TRAP GOES TO THIS CHURCH. EVERYBODY FROM THIS TRIBE GO TO REST YOUR SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT IT IS. &gt;&gt; UH-HUH. &gt;&gt; LET'S COME BACK TO THE WORD. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THE BRIDE IS MADE OF THE OUT OF EVERY KINGDOM. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; EVERY NATION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHAT HAVE WE PRODUCED? &gt;&gt; UHHUH. &gt;&gt; WHAT HAVE WE PRODUCED? &gt;&gt; WHICH HOLY GHOST DO YOU HAVE? &gt;&gt; WHICH HOLY GHOST DO YOU HAVE? &gt;&gt; Which Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; SOME DON'T WANT TO PUT THIS PREACHER HERE. &gt;&gt; THIS PICTURE here &gt;&gt; because the black man. &gt;&gt; Which Holy Ghost do you have? &gt;&gt; RIGHT. WAS JESUS A BLACK MAN? &gt;&gt; Was Jesus a a a white man? &gt;&gt; NO. &gt;&gt; WAS HE AN AFRICAN? &gt;&gt; NO. &gt;&gt; SO WHY DO WE PUT THIS PICTURE? &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; I have a question. When you go to the gas station, do you worry about the owner? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; I'm asking you, DO YOU WORRY ABOUT THE OWNER? &gt;&gt; NO. &gt;&gt; OF THE GAS STATION? &gt;&gt; NO. &gt;&gt; YOU GOING THERE BECAUSE YOUR CAR NEED GASOLINE? &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T CARE WHO'S THE OWNER. &gt;&gt; WHY? AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU GO TO THE RESTAURANT, DO YOU WORRY ABOUT THE OWNER? &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU BUY STUFF ON AMAZON, DO YOU WORRY ABOUT THE OWNER? &gt;&gt; WHY DO YOU WORRY ABOUT THE PASTOR? &gt;&gt; RIGHT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; COME IN THIS CHURCH BECAUSE OF THE WORD. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT SOMEBODY WILL PREACH TO ME THE PURE WORD. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BROTHER, BROTHER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. GIVE ME THE WORD THAT SAY &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THEN LET'S GO HOME TO OUR PLACE. &gt;&gt; We are talking about Christmas. &gt;&gt; Brother Glenn, &gt;&gt; I don't think I will preach what I wanted to preach. &gt;&gt; Flat attendant, prepare for landing.
