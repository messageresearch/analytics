========================================

because she was spiritual in seen visions. A few years afterwards they found out that that woman was a saint. So of course you done great penance. You dug up those priest's body that condemned her and burner and stole him into the river. Of course that you done great pentance for that for digging up this priest's body. Now in the days of the prophets what happened? They did the same thing. They didn't recognize them till they had done come ministry had finished took out of that the elected and then after they were gone they recognized that they had been a prophet among them. Jesus he came to the earth the endowed within him was the father God. I and my father are one. My father dwelleth in me. It's not me that doeth the works but my father. And if I do not the works of my father, believe me not. Now if you notice when he came about one one 90th of the world knew that he is even on earth at that time and yet the savior of the world. And then they never recognized who he was even the church or no one else until they crucified him, buried and rose on the third day before they ever know who he was. It comes in and goes out and people does not recognize it until it's passed and they because that it never fits their theology. It never fits the time of the day. You see what it is? They're always living in a glare of another age. Always. The reason they didn't accept Jesus because they were living in the glare of the law. And when Jesus came was not contrary to the law but come to fulfill the law well they couldn't accept him because his message wasn't exactly the way they had it all treated out and it was called then traditions and they he didn't come according to the traditions. He didn't keep their traditions and really he upset it and tore it up and and done things that was contrary to it in so much as they thought he's breaking up the churches and they couldn't receive him because of his message. And we all know today that he come exactly in the line of God's prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But they didn't know it then and it could happen again and we wouldn't know it. I imagine if he had actually appeared tonight, it would be so contrary to what we've all got all figured up on our charts and in our schools and things that be very few would recognize what was going on. &gt;&gt; He said it would be how he come. Now, uh Jesus being there so scripturally identified by the scriptures and the scribes and Pharisees of that day could not recognize him. Why didn't they? Why didn't they do it? Because they had it figured out some other way. That's where Jesus told him, "Search the scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life, and they are they that testify of me." Amen. &gt;&gt; See, now he come exactly with the scriptures, but they had it figured out maybe that if he would come uh uh the Messiah would probably do what Moses did or what Noah did, build him an arc or something else. But we reason he come the way he did, they hadn't figured out in the scriptures with their traditions did not teach them. So the people were so confused, they didn't know what was going on. Wonder if that could happen today. I wonder if it could be different than what our traditions has taught us. And it could come and something had passed through and we'd never even know until it's already passed and then it's over. That's just about the way it'll come. Do you know when John the Baptist came on the scene that had been predicted all the way from the book of Isaiah hundreds of years about 800 years Isaiah prophesied I think before the coming of Christ. Did you know John came exactly the way Isaiah said he would come? He come exactly the way Malachi said he would come and even the apostles didn't recognize it. One day in Matthew 11, John was in prison and the apostles uh some of his disciples went over to ask Jesus was he the one or or should they look for another? Now notice Jesus did not uh give him a book of how to behave themselves, how to behave himself in jail or how to conduct his character. He said, "Stay around and watch what happens and go show John the things that you seen happen." That was the evidence that the He was that work. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] [Music] Heat.

Lord, you've shown us the secrets of your heart, Lord God. You've revealed to us, Lord, that those very secrets are those who sit before me as I speak this morning, Lord God. your sons and daughters. Lord God, you've given us the power of the spoken word in the last days, Lord God, through the revelation of your word from a prophet, Lord God. How thankful we are, Lord God. The desperation lies in the thirst that we have, Lord God. We can't get enough, Lord God. And that's why we're here this morning, Lord God. To receive more from the throne, Lord, directly from the throne, Lord God. Come and speak your word to us once again this morning, Lord Jesus. Have mercy on us, Lord, and forgive us, Lord, where we fall short. Lord God, let us forsake the things of the world that's not part of you, Lord God. We're living in an evil time, Lord God. And we need you more and more and more every minute of every day, Lord God. But we have the reassurance, Lord God. We have the assurance of the word. We have the promise, Lord. All of them, Lord. We understand what you meant when you said, "It is finished when you were on the the cross, Lord God. And by resurrecting, Lord, you gave us that life, too, Lord, because you've defeated the grave and death and hell, Lord. And you've given us that ability as well, for we believe you, Lord God. Help us to live our lives for you more, Lord God. Let us use this time this morning as we hear your word, Lord, to just recommmit in our heart, Lord God. We thank you, Father. Bless our musicians this morning, Lord, our singers. Bless our technicians, Lord. Take away any tiredness, Lord God, or any distraction, Lord God, that may hinder us from just entering into worship, Lord, so that when that word comes out, Lord God, as our pastor, Lord, you have have spent some time together, Lord, for what you want us to hear this morning, Lord, just let it come freely, Lord, without hindrance, Lord, and let us also receive it freely, Lord. Take any thought contrary to thy word from our minds, Lord, while we sit here and listen, and let it sink deep into our soul, Lord God. We thank you, Father. Let us not be troubled, Lord. Strengthen our faith, Lord God. Endo us with your power from on high, Lord God, that when we speak, Lord, it's the same as you speak it, Lord God. for we have determined that we'll speak nothing other than your word, Lord God. We give it all back to you this morning, Lord Jesus. Heal anybody, Lord, here that's sick. I know it's not time for prayer, Lord, but as we sing, Lord, let the joy just override the pain, Lord God. Let it override the broken heart, Lord God, or the troubled soul, Lord. And let us just sing with our heart, Lord God, and back to you. May it be the spirit that you've placed in us wooing back to the spirit this morning, Lord God. We thank you, Father, and we give every bit of this service, every portion of it, every person, Lord, every soul in our precious congregation and the invisible audience as well, Lord, back to you in Jesus Christ's name.

Uh, it's pretty nice little pin. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we certainly we certainly hold to that cloud, right? Amen. &gt;&gt; That is the vindication of the message. Amen. Praise God. Praise God. &gt;&gt; So, uh, Sister Charlene has a testimony, but I'm going to read a couple more, uh, praise reports here. First, we have a couple of birthdays today. So, um, okay.

What a precious brother, too. Amen. Amen. [Laughter] Come on now, mama. It's hard to believe, ain't it? That's the way we look at Jeffrey. like how did where did you come from? So, we have one prayer request here and I got a quick glimpse of it and uh and uh this might be a little tough to read. Um this is from brother Michael Omach. Uh he says, "God bless you church. We request your prayers. Um we received information this morning of the passing of one of our grandsons. Uh his name is God Can. Amen. He died while in a boarding school. Uh he was 15 years old in the 10th grade. Uh we don't have any information at the moment, but we thank you for your prayers and just ask that God bless you for that. So, um let's stand this morning. And um Brother Kimma, do you mind coming up and praying over this prayer request? I'm sure we all have unspoken as well. It's been kind of a tough week. Let's just bow our heads. Gracious heavenly father, we thank you once again, Lord Jesus, for bringing us back to the house of God. We have come, oh father God, to worship the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords. There's none like you, Lord, the redeemer of our souls. the one who died on the cross and who made a way, oh God, that we may be what we are today. You are the lamb of God who took away our sins, the mighty God unveiled. And you did not want to keep that for yourself, but you came and shared it with us, your people, your bride, Lord, that we may have the righteousness of God, us who were sinners one day. Thank you for doing all of this for us, Lord Jesus. What can we give back to you, but our hearts, Lord, and that is what we're giving back this morning, Father, is the deepest, Father God, thoughts that we have. All of that we give back to you as a wife or father who's kept herself for her husband unveils herself to him. You are our husband this morning. Father, come and take over the service. Lord Jesus, bring your presence. Oh God, may you come and heal the sick. Oh Father, may you come and free the bond. Oh Father, whatever need is in your people this morning, Father. We know that you're more than able. Come, Lord Jesus, come. We are inviting your presence. It would be in vain that we gather without you here, Lord. Oh dear Jesus. You're the mighty God once again unveiled before us. Thank you for this message that you have sent that oh father God has cleansed us Lord has made us pure as pure can be. We've been washed by the blood of the lamb. Dear God, you've heard the request that went before you. May you take brother Mike and sister Rosemary. Oh father God losing their grandson not even knowing why. Father the why would be answered one day. But now we just bow before your throne. God receiving. Oh, Father, accepting for you said in your word that all things work together for the good. Even in death, there's always a good, Father God. There's nothing negative, oh Father, and that we do not want to have in our hearts this morning, Lord. But may you take the family, Father. Comfort them, Lord. Losing a loved one is not easy, Lord Jesus. Especially when he's 15, full of life, oh God. May you take the family, God, and comfort them, Lord Jesus, as you only you can take now the offering, the tithe, Lord Jesus. May you bless the giver, for we love to give you cheerfully. Bless the building fund, oh God, the building that's being built by faith. May you continue to increase our faith, oh God. May we be standing behind our pastor in this endeavor, Father God. And once we see the building finished, oh God, how rejoicing we shall be, Lord, knowing that we build a church, oh God, without any fund, but everything came from thee, Lord. We thank you once again. Take the service, Father. We give it back to you. Bless brother Steven this morning as he ministers to our hearts. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. [Music] Amen. And y'all might be seated. We're going to um have Sister Charlene give her testimony. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints. I just want to give a a little testimony about my school. Um so I took my classes in the spring and everything was fine. Um, I had registered for my fall classes and I thought I had my my FAFSA squared away so it would pay for my classes, but turns out I didn't and I got all my classes dropped for the fall semester. And it was a little late. So, there was no more seats for me to be able to uh reregister for my classes again. And so, I was like, uh, I got to wait another year to be able to take my classes and get in my program. But when all the testimonies were given out on Wednesday night, I was like, God will make a seat for me so I can register for my classes. And on Friday, I went and I checked my school's website and there was one seat left for me to take my classes. I just want to give glory to God. Amen. Amen. Brother Tmaine, you ready to sing a song this morning? Amen. I appreciate this man's uh wanting to sing. Amen. Let's give sister Kayla one second here, brother. She wants to give a quick testimony. Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; God bless you, church. Um as I had gotten up here maybe a few months ago, maybe last year, and told you all to keep Elijah in prayer um with school, and the Lord allowed our pastor to preach about being diligent and being the ant. He has really done that over the summer, even up until the beginning of this year to report because like brother John said, we're close-knit family. He has A's and B's and that's God's grace. So, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everybody all right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Try to sing this song if you know it. Help me out. Uh, I know brother John u texted to him. Uh, he say one of his favorite songs I remember since I was a young boy. I'm going try to uh try to sing to the best of my ability. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] We've turned a page for a new day has dawn. And we've rearranged what is right and what's wrong. And somehow we drifted so far from the truth and that we can't get back home. And where are the virtues that once gave us life? And where are the morals that governed our life? And one day we all will awake and look back just to find what we've lost. We need to get back to the basics of a life. A heart that is pure and a love that is mine. A faith that is verundy grounded in Christ. The hope that endures for all time. But these are the basics. We need to get back to the basics of life. [Music] And through the rage is the reason it out. Just meditating. You can overcome every doubt. After all, man is a God. They say God is no longer alive, but I still believe in the old rugged cross. Oh, I still believe there is hope for the lost. And I know the rock of all ages will stand through the changes of time. Through the changes of time, we need to get back to the basics of life. A word that is pure and love that is mine. A faith that is firly grounded in Christ. The hope that is for all time. [Music] These are the basics. We need to get back to the basics of life. [Music] We've let the darkness invade us too long. We got to turn the tide. Wo. When we need the passion that burn long ago to come and open our eyes, there's no room and no room for a compromise. We need we need to get back to the basics of life that is true and the love that is mine. [Music] A heart that is pure and a love that a love that is blind and verballently grounded in Christ of hope that is true for all time. And these are the basics we need to get back to the basics of life. God bless you. [Music] Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, uh before brother Tony sings the season for blessings, uh I've asked him if he felt led to sing a song before we get started again. So, we're going to invite everybody to sing with it. Where's my copy? [Laughter] &gt;&gt; God bless you this morning. You know, we're just going to exalt the Lord this morning. That's the hardest thing to do when we come through those doors is to get our minds off of everything that's going on. Take your mind off of every condition this morning, every situation this morning. And we're just going to exalt the one who makes everything possible in our lives. We want to thank you for life this morning. So, this is a congregational song this morning. The more we got, the merrier. We going to exalt the Lord this morning.

That's good. Everybody knows. But still, we're going to talk about &gt;&gt; in the perspective of the message of the hour &gt;&gt; and the Bible rad. Are we together? And then December the 13th will be our part 8. And Lord's willing after this coming Saturday, the next Saturday which is September the 27th will be our question and answer for the young uh sister a question and answer type of session for our young sisters. If there is any question go ahead and put it in because I'm going to once I begin to go through this meeting it get really busy on my side. So I apologize if you send me textes and and email I have not responded. So be gracious to me because we got textes, I got WhatsApp, my number keep going from one person to another and then I got ministers some are sending me quote every almost every day. This one is sending this this one. So it's so much and I have to remain focused. Amen. &gt;&gt; So bear with me by God's grace. So if I answer your your your text after one week just understand what's going on. If it's an emergency, call 911. Call the deacon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have you Have you called a doctor's office? The first thing they say, if it's a true emergency, do what? &gt;&gt; H. If it's a true emergency, call the deacon. &gt;&gt; The deacon knows where to get me. &gt;&gt; And if it's a prayer, the deacon will step on and pray for you. &gt;&gt; I was listening to brother Brandham yesterday and he was talking about Jetro. And brother Brandham was putting himself how all the big responsibility he have and brother Brandham said no you got brother Neville another the minister here you go ahead and deal with it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I got a lot of stuff and uh sometimes brother Brandham say he would die he would go to the grave with certain things in his heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So there are certain things spiritually I cannot explain to anybody. Even my wife, you won't understand me. &gt;&gt; And I just follow that direction and keep myself focused because I know what I'm in the middle of it. &gt;&gt; And it's hard for me to explain to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like Elisha telling Gazi there is more with us and you can look around you say where is more. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So there are things I don't know how to explain to you and sometime you see my behavior a certain way I'm behaving like that because of certain things. It takes a lot of spiritual maturity to understand what we're dealing with. &gt;&gt; So to avoid any headache, I just hush my mouth &gt;&gt; and just keeping my lane. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; On 85. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, Young Sisters meeting September the 27th, question and answer session. And then our question and answer for the church will be October the 11th which will uh be at the clubhouse. Everything is secured to the best of my knowledge. And then following that will be October the 25th with the patriarch. Then we go with part three on courtship. Their courtship is so deep for some reason the Holy Spirit deal with them differently the new young sisters. H but I understand because they're men. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, the Holy Spirit is dealing with them differently. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm learning myself stuff about courtship I didn't know. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I wish I knew them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But thank God for Sister Cher. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, October the 25th in this church, if you don't talk about your wife, that's your problem. &gt;&gt; I'm giving you an example. The pastor talk about his wife so that the entire congregation may talk about the wife. &gt;&gt; You tell them how beautiful they are, how sweet they are and all the kind of stuff. Then our children will know how to talk to the wife. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me stay away. I got a meeting tomorrow. I got a meeting coming up next week. So, let's deal in the meeting before I get offline here of off my lane. Amen. The building, we're still working with it. God's willing, we already got the code finalized for the door of the connector up front there. And Lord's willing on Monday, Lord, uh, Brother Micah will go try to put the order for the material. Then we can go. It seems like the the Abraham Lincoln is moving toward the connection of the building over there. As far as what we raising for the uh the foundation, we at $20,000 now. 20,000 now from a 67. You keep looking at your 67. That's your problem. Me, I'm looking at the 20,000 because it's a deep. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the deep will be calling to the deep. Yes. &gt;&gt; You know that mystery of the deep, right? &gt;&gt; It's the void that is really pulling. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we are on 25 20,000. I thank the Lord for 20,000. If he can get me to 20,000, he will get me to 67. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So, pray God the final touchup are almost done and will call for the final inspection and that building will be completed over there. I will try the best of uh the best that I can because the building is completed but it's empty. You need furniture. So I will try to put some chair quickly for the song leader and all the musician so that because that bathroom is ready to be used so they can all turn and go to the other side and they can do everything over there. So we begin to decrease the traffic on the back over there. So the musician will be coming this way. But as as far as my office, I need to wait till we put a desk or something then we get there. Amen. So be patient with me. I know some are quick on the trigger. When when when we will get there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. The pins are there. We got so many of them. They were free with our price, without money. And pray for me because uh it's something that have been there lingering. But I will try my best. We are very loaded but we can't be too loaded for that one. But we will try to find out how we can work up to have an hour of prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every week &gt;&gt; somehow &gt;&gt; one hour of prayer. I know if we put it for everybody to come here then it's going to be schedule and traveling. We will see I would talk with the technician and see if we can put a zoom where we can go one hour in prayer. You just get into the zoom &gt;&gt; and then we can pray wherever you are, wherever you stay. You just put request and everything and we pray one hour as a church. Whoever is available, &gt;&gt; you can just hop onto that line. We know that a certain day this time if you want to hop on a prayer line. Just hop there. We're praying. If I can't do it, I would direct it to brother Kitty, one of the deacon, and then they can take it so they can remove something off my plate. Because what I'm dealing with, it's more than just preaching here and the ministry. You're dealing with people separated left and right and and and at the same time you need to keep yourself studying and and and consecrated and move and all everything. So I got brother Kelly, I brought brother Robert and brother Tony all of them can hop in and they can direct you into prayer and everything. So by God's grace just keep just one day we just you know that one hour you just hop on there put your prayer request we pray and then when we come in church it's going to be like additional prayer is everything okay? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we okay with that? &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Brother Glenn Brother Glenn they like it. So by God's grace it's going to happen sooner. So just hope just give me some time to work with the technician sister Adasa will see how they can put everything together into a zoom. So it will go on the church group chat and then once you see the zoom you can just hop into the zoom and wherever you are just come in and we give the request and we all pray because Jesus spoke about one hour &gt;&gt; and if you get more anointing you can continue no problem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen.

So what causes that we miss season? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Human perception versus discernment in season. Let's go to the book of Judges, chapter 16, verse 17. Sister Rof, there is still a tiny noise in my monitor. Lord, a tiny one. Yes. Praise God. Yeah, it's getting better now at God's grace. Thank you. I'm going to stay on the surface because if I touch this a different way, we lost. He's going to preach a different message. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So let's focus where we are. &gt;&gt; Uh Judges chapter 16 verse 17. If you there you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know this story very well. &gt;&gt; Stay alert. You see somebody's slumbering. Shake. Shake. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ah. Amen. The Bible says in verse 17 that he told her, &gt;&gt; this is Samson, &gt;&gt; Samson, he told her all his heart. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; And say to her, there has not come a razor upon my head. You may be seated. We clear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For I have been a Nazerat to God from my mother's womb. So he knew the secret. of his power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He just opened his mouth and unfolded and and disclosed the secret. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To dilah. &gt;&gt; The Bible say, "For I have been a Nazerite to God from my mother's womb. If I shave, Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then my strength will go from me." So the strength of Samson or the divine because brother Brandham say he look like a Cece. &gt;&gt; You need the quote you see me after church. &gt;&gt; And brother Bradam say he didn't have big muscles. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Like the movie you watch. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; All you have watched. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He was not a big man. &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; So he was brother Brham explained that it was a mystery. Yes, I am. &gt;&gt; His strength was completely a mystery &gt;&gt; preach. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, his strength was connected to something &gt;&gt; in his body. &gt;&gt; And his strength was connected to the hair. &gt;&gt; I'm reading my Bible, my friend. &gt;&gt; Samson say if they cut what? &gt;&gt; His hair. &gt;&gt; What will happen to him? lose &gt;&gt; lose his strength. &gt;&gt; So the strength of Samson was connected to what? &gt;&gt; His hair. &gt;&gt; Good. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's the way I like it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The hair of Samson &gt;&gt; was connected to his strength. &gt;&gt; And this strength is not a natural strength. &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; It was a divine strength &gt;&gt; but connected to his head. How can hair &gt;&gt; carry strength, sisters? &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; be careful with your head. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be careful with your hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is a power in the hand. [Applause] &gt;&gt; There is power in hand. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together now. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are together now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's a wig right there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm warming the engine. You know, when you get into the airplane, the airplane begin to move and go back and go to the left and go back until we get to the place where we need. So, I'm I'm I'm just moving slowly. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope you slept well. Amen. &gt;&gt; Ah, glory to God. Sister Sherro, say amen. So everything is good. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Bible says, "From my mother's womb," God bless you. Welcome, my friend. He said, "From my mother's womb." Amen. From my mother's womb, if I be shaved, then my strength will go from me &gt;&gt; and I shall become how? &gt;&gt; Weak. &gt;&gt; And be like what? &gt;&gt; Any other man. &gt;&gt; So he was not he was not like any other man. No. &gt;&gt; He was not like any other man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because of the Nazareth vow. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; And the strength that he had. &gt;&gt; In other words, there was something supernatural [Music] &gt;&gt; in Samson that was more than what is natural. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was a natural being with something supernatural connected to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that supernatural thing was connected to his hair. &gt;&gt; How did we end up in Samson talking about season? &gt;&gt; Job to verse 18. And when Dilala saw that he had told her all his heart, he sent and called for the Lord of the Philistine. We clear now? Amen. &gt;&gt; So she can discern that this time is not fake. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; This time is the truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; That he told her all his heart. She sent for and called for the lords of the Philistines saying, "Come up this once." In other words, this time it's working. &gt;&gt; For he has showed me what? &gt;&gt; All his heart. &gt;&gt; Was that all his heart? Was that everything? &gt;&gt; Keep that in mind. He has showed me all his heart because a mystery even if it's revealed &gt;&gt; there is still a what? &gt;&gt; Supernatural element. &gt;&gt; Supernatural element despite the re &gt;&gt; revelation. Amen. Glory, glory, glory. &gt;&gt; So when Dala heard what came up, &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; she grabbed with the best that she can get. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Didn't know that that was God's bait. &gt;&gt; Wow. Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She said, "Now we got it." &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; She didn't know that there is still a supernatural element. That's why the devil can read this seven seals book. &gt;&gt; That's right. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Anybody can read this message. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But it doesn't mean they understand the message. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's exactly right. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can gain information. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But not revelation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Help me up my friend. I'm just waiting. There is an airplane in front of me. I'm moving slowly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We clear my friend. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "And when he told him all his heart, &gt;&gt; he has showed me all his heart. Then the Lord of the Philistine came up to her and brought what? &gt;&gt; Money. &gt;&gt; In water in their hand." &gt;&gt; So they were convinced that now the deal is done. Get your salary. &gt;&gt; We clear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And she made him sleep. upon her knees. Very dangerous. Let me leave it alone. Very dangerous. Hey, your meeting is next week. &gt;&gt; Okay, let me handle what I'm handling here. Okay. And she call for a man and she calls him to be what? &gt;&gt; To shave off &gt;&gt; shave off what? &gt;&gt; The seven locks of his hair. &gt;&gt; This hair has seven locks. Remember we went through this in the hotel. I'm trying to stay away from that and stay on my line. Okay. &gt;&gt; This hair, this supernatural hair &gt;&gt; have how many locks? &gt;&gt; Seven locks. &gt;&gt; Why only seven locks? &gt;&gt; Why only seven locks? &gt;&gt; What did he say? &gt;&gt; Seven angels. and say, &gt;&gt; "Are we together?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they shave off what? Seven locks of his head. &gt;&gt; These locks were seven individually. &gt;&gt; In other words, when you see Samson, you can count them. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 &gt;&gt; Can you count this here? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Can you see where where is the connection? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; This one. &gt;&gt; It's seven. &gt;&gt; But you cannot count them. &gt;&gt; They are blended. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But the first hair of Samson was divided. &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay, go watch the sermon in the hotel. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The first hair is divided. &gt;&gt; Lut &gt;&gt; Paul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wesley &gt;&gt; and my Columbus Martin those are divided here. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then the Lord of the uh where are we at?

And his strength did what? &gt;&gt; Went from him. &gt;&gt; So when the hair left, what left? &gt;&gt; The strength. &gt;&gt; Because the hair you can refocus Adasa is connected to the strength. &gt;&gt; You remove hair, &gt;&gt; you remove strength. Uh-huh. But to begin with, where did the hair came from? &gt;&gt; How did he get his hair? Where is your hair coming from? &gt;&gt; We We go to the barber shop, we cut hair, &gt;&gt; then what happened? &gt;&gt; So where is the hair coming from? &gt;&gt; From within. &gt;&gt; They didn't go there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They cut the superficial. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. They should have went in the root. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But the root hides life. &gt;&gt; That's right.

I'm done with this guy." &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Did he know the roots are there? &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. And if the roots are there Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; the tree is there. That's right. &gt;&gt; Every bushel of That's right. are still there. That's right. &gt;&gt; Look how many things the devil tried to remove from your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he cannot touch the root. &gt;&gt; Amen.

And she said, "The Philistine be upon you, Samson." And he awoke out of sleep and say, "I will go out as as uh at other time presuming preach the message." Presumption uh I mean presuming and shake myself. And he knew not &gt;&gt; that what &gt;&gt; the Lord was departed from him. &gt;&gt; So the Lord was where &gt;&gt; was gone. &gt;&gt; The Lord have departed from whom &gt;&gt; Samson. &gt;&gt; So the Lord was where? &gt;&gt; So if you cut the hair, what happened to the Lord? &gt;&gt; What about if the hair come back? &gt;&gt; It come back. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. Are we together? &gt;&gt; If you remove the hair, what happen to the Lord? &gt;&gt; He leaves. &gt;&gt; And when the hair is back, what happened to the Lord? &gt;&gt; He comes back to [Music] &gt;&gt; So this So this hair is connected to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Elohim. &gt;&gt; Amen. capital L &gt;&gt; L O R D. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Philistine took the natural things off. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They didn't know the supernatural secret. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They should have shaved Samson and burned the root. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But they left the root. Yeah, &gt;&gt; big mistake. &gt;&gt; We clear my friend. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This reading is getting lengthy. I'm trying to move, my friend. We ready? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse uh 21. &gt;&gt; But the Philistine took him and did what? &gt;&gt; Put out his eyes. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Why they didn't cut the hand of Samson? &gt;&gt; I know, right? Please help me so we move. &gt;&gt; Why? Why the only inspiration &gt;&gt; that the Philistine can get is only his eyes. &gt;&gt; They didn't say, "Let's cut his ear." &gt;&gt; Or maybe, you know what? Let's cut his leg. Let's amputate his leg so he won't be able to walk. &gt;&gt; Or they could say, you know what, let's cut his arm so next time, even if his strength come, he won't know how to fight. But they left his arm. &gt;&gt; They left his feet. &gt;&gt; And they went and they attacked directly the eye. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? &gt;&gt; Remember the problem of Samson is with women. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Take your time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And women are connected to the eyes. &gt;&gt; That's right. Because Jesus said, "Whosoever lookth upon a woman &gt;&gt; and last upon her have already committed adultery with her in the heart." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So the weakness of Samson was connected to his eyes. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So God allowed that weakness to be carried out. &gt;&gt; Amen. In other words, Samson is changing season. Come on. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this, my friend, in the message Jas and divine healing. He says, "The eye is what? &gt;&gt; The gate to the soul. a gate to water. &gt;&gt; That's all. &gt;&gt; So, it's a dangerous gate. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And every time Samson a problem with a woman, &gt;&gt; a problem with a woman. A problem with a woman. God said, "No worry." &gt;&gt; When they caught him, he say, "Uh-uh, this time I'm going to deal with what caused you to get to this point." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. So God was pruning Samson. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. &gt;&gt; It is horrible. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Take your time. &gt;&gt; Because Samson got two eyes. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he got another eye. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Which was a spiritual eye. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says we walk by what? &gt;&gt; Faith, not by sight. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's faith. &gt;&gt; Verse is what? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What they destroy was what? &gt;&gt; The fire. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Amen. By faith. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because faith may bring new eyes. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on, Lord. Uh, help me please. Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Keep your finger where we are. I'm still reading the Bible. &gt;&gt; Go to the book of Hebrew 11. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Go to Hebrew 11. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. &gt;&gt; You say I'm going to preach this, move on quick. Something else. [Laughter] Let's go to Hebrew 11. If you there, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go to verse 32, my friend. You there? &gt;&gt; The Bible say because Hebrew 11 is talking about the heroes of faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Bible say through faith Enoch did this through this I mean Abraham and Moses and so we know all of them by faith by faith. By faith by faith. Okay. But today we talking about Samson. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. His eyes naturally. &gt;&gt; The Bible says in verse 32, "And what shall I more say?" Paul is continuing &gt;&gt; for the time will fail me. &gt;&gt; In other words, Paul is telling you there are more heroes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I don't have time to go one by one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other word, down the road, you fill in the blank. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can go back in the Bible and continue to pick them up. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; In other words, Paul put a comma. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And left the door so we can get there and continue. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul says, "And then time will fail me to tell of who?" &gt;&gt; Gideon. &gt;&gt; Come on. And of who? &gt;&gt; And of who? &gt;&gt; Samson. &gt;&gt; So Samson is a hero of faith. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We clear now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we need to know Samson did what? Because Enoch by faith. Abraham by faith. Moses by faith. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; He says Samson come and who? &gt;&gt; Jeffa. &gt;&gt; Come and of who? &gt;&gt; David also. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

You can take Joseph. You can take Jacob. You can put all of them up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And of the prophet who through what? &gt;&gt; Faith. &gt;&gt; Ah. So Samson have faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; Absolutely right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Samson, through faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We clear now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Through faith did what? &gt;&gt; Subdued kingdoms &gt;&gt; and what? &gt;&gt; Wrought righteousness &gt;&gt; and what? &gt;&gt; Obtain promises &gt;&gt; and what? &gt;&gt; Stomp the mouths of lion. &gt;&gt; That's That's Daniel. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And quench water. &gt;&gt; Violence of fire. &gt;&gt; This is Shadrach, Macho. You can fill in the blank. And did water &gt;&gt; escape the edge of the sword. And out of what? &gt;&gt; Weakness was made strong. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Who became weakness &gt;&gt; who lost strength. &gt;&gt; But out of that weakness through faith, &gt;&gt; Samson became strong. Amen. &gt;&gt; Perception. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go back to the book of Judges. We understand that this his strength left him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Samson became weak. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But Hebrew 11 just told us that Samson &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not through human natural. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Not through perception. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Through revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Samson who was weak. was made how strong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; So now we clear, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where were we at, my friend? &gt;&gt; 21. &gt;&gt; Verse 21. But the Philistine did what? &gt;&gt; Took him &gt;&gt; and did water. &gt;&gt; Put out his eyes. &gt;&gt; And we found out brother Brandham is saying here that the eye is the soul to the water. &gt;&gt; Gave to the soul. Ah, brother Bam say five senses and the eye almost &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; does what &gt;&gt; governs the others. &gt;&gt; In other words, among the five senses, the eyes dominate the other. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Brother say you look at the Catholic Church. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Not a what? a long time ago &gt;&gt; when they put up what? &gt;&gt; Statues forth in there. &gt;&gt; The psychology of what? &gt;&gt; Of sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The eye. &gt;&gt; The Catholic Church already understood the power of the eye. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They already understood the psychology behind the eye. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That if you can put something really nice that look like this, you can catch the eye. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you catch the eye, you catch the souls. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And God say, you know what? Remove the eye. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; If the eye is the gate to the soul. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; And they remove the eye. They remove what? &gt;&gt; The gate. &gt;&gt; And if they remove the gate, what else entrance is there to the soul of Samson? &gt;&gt; Faith. &gt;&gt; No. How can you again get to the soul of Samson? &gt;&gt; You can't. It's finished. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; It's a road block. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In other words, God put a blockage. &gt;&gt; Come on, Lord. &gt;&gt; To the soul of something. That's right. &gt;&gt; You can no longer touch the soul of Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God did that. Come on. &gt;&gt; In other words, Samson has moved from a season of attachable &gt;&gt; to untouchable. Amen. Yet this season to our perception of bad. &gt;&gt; Come on, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You didn't get me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you look at that, it looks bad. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Real bad.

In other words, they have discernment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of time, of season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you have discernment of time &gt;&gt; or discernment of season, &gt;&gt; it means season has a message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm starting to preach. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay, let me let me read so we start preaching.

There are people who are happy when the economy are bad. &gt;&gt; There are people who are sad when the economy are bad. &gt;&gt; And there are people when you say, "Oh, mask, they have disappeared." They begin to praise the Lord &gt;&gt; because that's when they make money. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; There's no tea. They say, "Praise the Lord. This is our own opportunity." &gt;&gt; And they make billionaire. &gt;&gt; That's right. During co time they made billion &gt;&gt; just by the opportunity when you were all there in the hospital. Oh be careful put the mask on. Stay away 5t. They were there all the tome from China. Put the tome &gt;&gt; the more the fear the more the money. &gt;&gt; Where were you focusing on?

The d kept you alive." Amen. &gt;&gt; Now you change on us. Say, "No, no, no, no, no. Everything went up. &gt;&gt; There's two ways. You can get upset from the M &gt;&gt; or you can decode the message." When it happened to me, I said, "Brother Robert, brother Robert said, brother Steven, there was a pharaoh who didn't know Joseph. In other words, a season has opened up." &gt;&gt; In other words, it was the season to leave. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? &gt;&gt; Depending on how you look at and suddenly that money that money that money and look at the that money there's a building there. &gt;&gt; How much is it? That money building that money building and it happened all the same time. &gt;&gt; What do you think? Am I decoding? &gt;&gt; Hey, get the money. Get the building. As soon as we left the building, the manager quit. What are you understanding? The manager quit. They brought a new manager. She called us. She said, "Come back. We decrease the price." &gt;&gt; Now the money we were paying begin to do work here. &gt;&gt; It depends on how you interpreting. &gt;&gt; What are you perceiving? I'm perceiving a time to go. I'm receiving a time that God is telling me move on. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together &gt;&gt; today? Because I gave the testimony. Who's going to get mad on that manager? &gt;&gt; The manager become a blessing. &gt;&gt; At that time, she was a curs. &gt;&gt; So everything the devil is bringing to you &gt;&gt; that seems bad. One of these days you will say surely all things work together for good. I see it now. What I thought was bad, I finally understood it was for my good.
