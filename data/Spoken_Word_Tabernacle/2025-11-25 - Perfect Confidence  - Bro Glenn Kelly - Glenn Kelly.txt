========================================

the nation from place to place. All kinds of signs and wonders that showed up right at the end time and yet the church set days it was pretty good. I I believe I may go to another night. See what'll take place at the next meeting. That's not the thing to do. What we need when we see God moving in our midst is to get down to business with it. PRAY AND CROWD AND [screaming] DO ALL that we know how to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let the gospel in this last days attract our attention. Bible promised that this gospel would just become so each day like in the days of Luther he taught sanctific or justification become minority when it come to the westerly Methodist age through sanctification. Then when they settle down to a church and that was all it was to it. God raised up Pentecost and now it's got to the place that Pentecost is becoming farmland and different. God moves right on that. He won't stop at all. &gt;&gt; He goes right on. The children of Israel followed a pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; And every time that fire stopped, they stopped with it. &gt;&gt; And if they didn't move, they was left in the wilderness. They had to move where the fire moved. That's the way God's church always does. It moves with the fire. &gt;&gt; When Martin Luther saw the fire, the first reformation, he come out of the Catholic Church and he built his denomination under it. The fire moved into sanctification. He's already organized under that and couldn't do it go any further. Methodists took it. They organized under that. They couldn't go no farther. Pentecost come and tuck it from them. Now, if we don't watch, the fire will move right on again. Let's stay under the fire. Worship under the fire. Worshiping the power of the spirit, believing God's word, laying aside every weight. &gt;&gt; AND EVERY SIN THAT DOES EASILY beset us. And what is sin? Unbelief. He that believeth not is condemned already. They're just two sin. One, two things in the world. One is faith and the other is unbelief. Committing adultery, smoking, drinking, that's not sin. That's the attributes of sin. You do that because you're not a believer. A believer doesn't do those things. You either believe or do not believe. There's three classes of people usually tends a meeting anywhere. And that's unbelievers make believers and real believers. And there always that crowd everywhere. And now what we want to do is be real believers. Draw our heart into this word. Let the word be the word of God be the final decision of every one of us. &gt;&gt; You owe it to me. You ought to me as a minister. If you ever see anything that's going on in the meeting that's not exactly with the scripture, then you owe to me to come tell me. It's right you do. I believe that God does things that's not wrote in the Bible. I believe that God's God. He can do what he wishes to. But as long as I know it's staying right in that cover there and know that God made a promise, I feel assured with that. &gt;&gt; As long as I can have that, I'll be satisfied with whatever anything else. Nothing else will satisfy me like that. As long as I can stay right with that. Now, the only way to find out what Jesus is today is to go back and find what he was yesterday. If he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Is that logical? Is that sensible? Well, now let's go back then. I was reading here a few moments ago in St. John the the 12th chapter, I believe it was. Yes, sir. 12th chapter, 20 21st verse. Now, let's go back at the first book of St. John. I want you to study with me and through the week so we won't stay too long. I guess you heard that go off just saying that was my watch. I have an alarm watch from Switzerland and I think when I was setting up I I had that alarm set but I haven't got started yet. So I just had to turn it off. Now Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today and forever. Let's turn back to the first chapter of St. John and find out if you read a book and it said Mary and John lived happily ever after. Who is Mary and John? You'll never know till you go back to the first of the book and read the book through. If the Bible says that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and forever, the only way we'll ever know what he was, what he should be today, we'll have to go back to see what he was yesterday. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, let's find out. We get St. John 1. We'll just quote some scriptures. I want you to read it. I'm going to go over a few chapters in it tonight. Tomorrow night, pick up some more and so forth as we go along the way. The Holy Spirit will lead. But let's find out what he was yesterday. Then if we can see exactly what he was yesterday and see him come into our midst and do the same thing today, every sick person in your life get up and thank God and walk out. Say it's all over. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now remember before we get to it, divine healing is not some magic word that someone says over you. Divine healing, every sick person in here is already healed in the sight of God. He was wounded for our transgression. You say, "Brother Brand, what do you mean by that?" All right. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. Can [music] be upstanding tonight. Amen. Even as we commit the service into the hands of the Lord with a word of prayer. Amen. Father in the name of Jesus, we are grateful Lord to be in your presence tonight.

Um, this also says, "We want to thank God for giving Sister Victoria another year of life." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Tomorrow she will be turning 21. Amen. May God continue to bless her and keep her.

One from brother Zach I was told and one also from brother polycap. So before we invite brother polycap brother Zach will share with us his testimony. Amen. I just want to thank the [clears throat] Lord. Um because we were driving home earlier from the store, me and Lily, and uh a deer jumped right out in front of us and totally messed up the front bumper. So, we barely even felt it when we hit the deer. So, I just want to thank the Lord for keeping us safe. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's that's testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. Amen. So, invite brother Paul. Amen. Okay. So, okay. Yeah. So, Brother Polycap, then after that, Sister Rebecca May God bless you. &gt;&gt; I have a testimony &gt;&gt; that God did in the life of a pastor. Fernando Zata. &gt;&gt; It's Pastor Fernando Zat. &gt;&gt; He's in Virginia. &gt;&gt; His father was a pastor in Africa. &gt;&gt; He was hospitalized. He has something in his throat in the inside &gt;&gt; and there was a nurse who was treating him and they did a decision to take something out and the nurse noticed that she failed. And they had to transfer the brother into a different hospital because he suffered for three days in the hospital. He was trying to um reach his father who's pastor to pray for him but he could not. So there was a desire in his heart that was telling him to call brother Polycar. &gt;&gt; Then he called me. He told me I am not well. I tried to reach my father but I could not. But God plac in my heart to call you so you can pray for me. So I told him let let us pray even if they have to transfer you or bring you to another hospital. But my prayer is for God to touch you before you arrive to the transfer. The surgery wasn't successful. Then the doctor say, "We're going to see in the morning. I'm going call a colleague that's in the same line of work to see if we can try again. And in the morning they came and they were trying to see how they can transfer the way they needed to transfer. And the doctor was speaking to their colleagues saying that uh that they've done a lot of errors. So he didn't know how to go about it. &gt;&gt; After the diagnosis and everything that they've done, they noticed there was something that was very big. When they looked at the diagnosis and the picture and the person themselves, when the colleagues came, they started um congratulating the doctor for the works that he's done. So they started telling their the doctor that committed a lot of errors that when we're looking at it, we don't see anything. We don't know why you contacted us. And the doctor was confused and didn't understand how with every errors that he's done and they state that he left the client that the next day the client is all healed and all. And when that happened, they noticed that they couldn't do anything from the exterior, touching the throat or anything because they noticed that God had already healed the man. And that's why we're glorifying the Lord. And the brother told me to give the testimony. That's why I came to give the testimony. &gt;&gt; May God bless you all. [applause] What's up, Rebecca? I'm going to ask brother John to thank the Lord for our testimonies. &gt;&gt; God bless y'all. Um, so a couple weekends ago after Yok's wedding, my husband and I went to spend some time with his mom in Alabama and we went uh mudding or jeeping and um he has a bar in the front of it that was already kind of bent upward some, but we were going on the trails. It got bent up more into the deep and it we got stuck. Couldn't turn, couldn't go anywhere. And so I was I got out the deep and I'm like telling myself try not to panic because we got to get home that the next day, Sunday. So I'm like I calmed down instantly. I'm like I'm not going to panic. So, um, I just started singing and praying and claiming the Lord was going to get us out of there somehow. So, um, less than 20 or 30 minutes later, we had another party of jeep, eight jeeps, eight come up behind us on the trail and they all were, most of them were mechanics and they all came up the trail behind where we were stuck at and helped us get the bar out. Within like an hour, they had pulled it the bar off and straightened it more than it had been before and we were able to get out of that trail and and get on home safely. So, [applause] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. We thank the Lord for the wonderful testimonies tonight. Amen. So, Brother John, we will pray for the tithes and then the offerings as well. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to thank the Lord. Also, um we got a neighbor that's elderly and um her daughter's reporting that she she went through surgery yesterday and everything's coming out just fine. So, Amen. Amen. So, let's uh let's just thank the Lord. Father, we come to you tonight, Lord, uh with thanksgiving in our hearts, Lord God. Not just because it's the season, Lord, for the, you know, outside of these four walls, but in our hearts, Lord, we're every day thankful for what you do for us, Lord God. And Lord, we we just don't know how to express it sometime, Lord God. the the gratitude that we have, Lord, for this wonderful word that you give us, Lord, and where you've brought us from, Lord God, and and and we know where we're going now, Lord Jesus.

We thank you, Father. We have the these other prayer requests, Lord God, that that uh you heard, Lord, that we just need your help with.

We greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Both visible and invisible audience. I see brother Brian there. Not a visitor. God bless you with the family. Your daughter I I won't even [laughter] she's part of the family. Amen. And I see my sister back there. God richly bless you and welcome to spoken word tabernacle. Amen. I do not know the name but you're not a visitor. you are family members so feel at home. Uh usually we preach and our Wednesdays are convention but today we got a Tuesday. Say it again. Say it again. &gt;&gt; Sister who? Sister Faith. God bless you. Sister Faith. Good to see you. I know you. [laughter] God bless you. Welcome again to Spoken Word. Amen. Oh, praise the Lord. Good to see you in the midweek service. So, welcome. And you you at home. You're not a visitor. You've been here before. God richly bless you. Amen. Glory to God. Uh usually on Wednesday, this is when we have our convention. But today is Tuesday, so it's a special service and it's a thanksgiving week. So, we have a lot to thank God. &gt;&gt; So, before we even ask him when we start praying, there is a lot we can thank him because it's the Thanksgiving week. Let's take some time and then express our gratitude unto the Lord because he want to hear somebody to just tell him thank you because God has been so so so good to us. Amen. You clear with the two Josephs. When you see all those things climb coming up clear like that in the scripture, it just blow your mind how the holy scripture were written in a certain way. And God is a rich God. Amen. &gt;&gt; You understand this now? I went through quote and scripture and everything. God is a rich God who humble himself and became poor so that through his poverty we may become rich. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is two choices. Either you let the beaten of Jesus go like that or you take advantage of him. He was wounded. He was bruised so that we can get healing. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he was not just bruised like that. Uh so let's go ahead. If he was already bruised and the devil did what he was supposed to do, it is our responsibility to do what we are supposed to do to reap the benefit of what he got there. Amen.

While you're standing, let's turn to Hebrews and let's look at uh chapter 4. Hebrews chapter 4. Y'all just pull with me now. I got my timer on over here. So we we in good shape. Okay. [laughter] Hallelujah. Once you have Hebrews 4 verse 16, you have it. Say amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It says, "Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace." He said that ye may obtain mercy and find grace to to help in the time of what need. Is that right? You may be seated that you can find. We're talking about a little thought here that we just was um bringing here tonight. You know, perfect confidence. Perfect confidence. You know, this can only be preached to the bride. This can only be preached to the message of the hour. This is only could be preached. Is that right? Because we know perfect means what? It's finished, right? It's finished. It's complete. Is that right? We're finished. We're complete inside of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Is that right? And so we know when we got that's why we read that scripture, honey, say Joshua because confidence mean what? Boldly, right? We can come to the T with boldness. Is that right? We don't have to back up nothing from the devil. Is that right? This is the hour of all promises. Is that right? This is the hour. He say this is the season. He said in Ecclesiastics 3, there is a what? A season, right? For everything. Is that right? &gt;&gt; So this is the season. Is that right? For everything. Is that right? We don't have to wait for win or summer and fall. This is the season for everything. That's why we read that scripture says what? You can go to God when you need anything right now. Is that right? That's what HE'S SAYING. THAT'S WHY YOU CAN GO BOLDLY to the throne. Is that right? Because in the Old Testament, it was just a ritual. It was just a form. They had to go to the throne every year. Is that right? &gt;&gt; So the high priest, he had to present a sacrifice for himself and then he went in there. Is that right? &gt;&gt; I heard the prophet of God said they was jealous of him. We going to read some quotes in a minute. So just bear with me. We got our time and we going to let him have his way. Is that right? We're going to pound the devil in the head tonight. Is that right? We just lay the ground because when we get on prayer, we going on offense. Is that right? We're not backing up from nothing. We claiming everything because this is the hour. Brother Brandon said when Jesus met John at the river, is that right? And John said, "Uh, I needed to be baptized of you. Is that right?" He said, "No. Uh-uh. You I need for you to be baptized of me." Why? because he said all scriptures must be fulfilled. Brother Brandham said EVERY SCRIPTURE IN THAT Bible will be fulfilled in this age that we in. We can go through the throne of boldness. WHAT? WITH BOLDNESS. IS THAT RIGHT? WITH CONFIDENCE. That's right. Knowing that we going to get what we asked for. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Have your way, Lord. &gt;&gt; He said, "Look what we say. Help us, Lord. We come in there. We're talking about &gt;&gt; boldness, confidence. We don't have to back up with anything. &gt;&gt; This thing is so simple. It's Oh, I'm like the pastor now. Huh, Levi? It's loaded. Is that right? Ah, it's loaded. You need to get into this message. Get in your quiet time with this message. Boy, if I would had it when I was your age, man, I'd be running all around tearing the devil's kingdom down. Is that right? &gt;&gt; TEAR IT DOWN BECAUSE WE GOT HIS ANSWER. WHY? Uh he brought us the boldness to go because we got the perfect word from the perfect person. We come from God. UH WE GO BACK TO GOD. Uh in the beginning was the what? The word. The word WAS GOD. THE WORD WAS with God. The word was made flesh. UH NOW IS DWELLING among us. YE ARE GODS. YE ARE MESSIAHS. We come from God. WE GO BACK TO GOD. WE'RE NOT LOSING the one. WE'RE GOING TO BRING THEM ALL IN. &gt;&gt; Look what he says here. &gt;&gt; This from the message 11355. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Huh. Paragraph 42. Listen to this. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Ah. &gt;&gt; If you &gt;&gt; want to go back a little further, Just as far as historical, we could see the word. Now look how brother Brandham caught the mind of God. &gt;&gt; He said we could see the word in the beginning was the word. &gt;&gt; But what is a word? A word is a is a thought what? Manifested. &gt;&gt; Let it sink in. It's a thought manifested. It's not the letter. The letter kill them. The spirit giveth life. Is that right? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We got mighty testimonies to show that our God is not dead, but he's what? He's alive. Is that right? &gt;&gt; We don't have to back up from any sickness. We thank God for the doctors. We thank God for the hospitals. We thank God for the nurses. We thank God for the equipment. But once the doctors say they can't do no more, you got to what? I look unto the hill to where my strength and my help come from. Jehovah Gyra. Is that right? [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Jehovah Raire, &gt;&gt; the Lord God. Uh a heal of all thy disease. This is not just an intellect. This is a life. We live by this now. Is that right? This is our life, saints. Uh we're not backing up. Is that right? This is the hour. We won't need healing and deliverance, finances, AND THE LORD DROPPED DOWN WHAT? Sunday morning to show us there's nothing wrong being rich. Is that right? Hallelujah. The perfect God gives us confidence to ask the things that we need. &gt;&gt; Because he's a perfect word. Uh &gt;&gt; he JUST DIDN'T SPEAK IT just to be speaking it. &gt;&gt; Let me keep going. Look what he said. Help me Lord. He says, "A word is a thought manifest." &gt;&gt; A thought spoken forth. &gt;&gt; God first he what? Proceedth. &gt;&gt; PRECEDED MEAN GOD COULD NOT EVEN SPEAK his own word unless HE THOUGHT ABOUT IT BEFORE HE SPOKE IT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; He had to UNDERSTAND WHAT HE WAS ABOUT TO SAY BECAUSE WHEN IT WENT FORTH, HE KNOW THAT IT HAD TO MANIFEST WHAT HE SAID. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Perceived &gt;&gt; that's knowing. &gt;&gt; Huh? He's saying it's he perceived the thought and he spoke it &gt;&gt; and it became a word &gt;&gt; and the word became became material. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Look at first let's look at first John five and 14. I know I want to get these scriptures before we moving good by the grace of God. First John five and let's look at verse I mean I tell you what let's start at verse uh 13. Start at verse uh 13. First John 5 and 13. These things have I written un unto you. Believe on the what? The name of the son of God. That ye know that ye have what? &gt;&gt; You believe it. &gt;&gt; He's saying there no YOU KNOW IT. IT'S A DIFFERENT WHEN you move from believing to knowing. When you believeing TO KNOWING, FAITH COME BY HEARING, HEARING THE WORD OF GOD. WHEN YOU HEAR THE WORD OF GOD, IT WILL BE A PERFORMANCE. IS THAT RIGHT? IT WILL BE A PERFORMANCE BECAUSE YOU HEARD FROM GOD. YOU HEARD FROM YOUR THEOPHONY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; We move from believing to knowing now. &gt;&gt; Huh? When you know something, &gt;&gt; IT'S BEEN REVEALED TO YOU. PETER, who did thou say that I am? &gt;&gt; Huh? Who do thou say that I am? Some say you Elijah. Some say you John the Baptist. Some say you Jeremiah. Some say you one of the prophets. Who do thou say that I am? Thou art the what? The Christ, the son of the living God. Uh brings the word to life. Is that right? He is now God in the flesh. Is that right? Huh? What' it say, pastor? You couldn't preach that. Let's set THE RECORD STRAIGHT. HUH? Let's set the record straight uh about this Holy Ghost. Is that right? How they going to identify this Holy Ghost? Is that right? My battle out there in the world is salvation. I've preached salvation. Salvation versus religion. My battle is against religion. All the years, that's what we're fighting against, right? We wrestle not against what? &gt;&gt; Flesh and blood, but against what? principalities and powers and wickedness and rulers in high places. They're going to say they don't God doesn't use prophets anymore. Is that right? Huh? Then they had to come and bring us a word, right? And they try to fight against the scripture, brother Polycar. They try to use what? Hebrew 1. Is that right? They try to use Hebrew 1. He says in diverse times, is that right? God spoke through the prophets. Is that right? But in diverse time, he said they say now these kind of things you going to fight against. Huh? The the you getting ready to move into some big battles now. Huh? That word is not just coming. He said store it up. &gt;&gt; Store it up. &gt;&gt; God sent you a servant that's not afraid. He loved God. He loved his message. He love his people. &gt;&gt; This is what they come and say, "God don't use prophets no more." Huh? And they get around in it. He said, "Now they speak to who?" Jesus Christ. Is that right? I said, "I got a question for you, my brother. This is what it mean." And they said, "Yeah." He's take the Hebrew one. He said, "In diverse times, is that right?" I said, "Is Adam a prophet?" Huh? He was a son and a prophet. Was Moses a prophet? Son of son of God and a prophet. Son of man and a prophet. Was Ezekiel a prophet? Is that right? Was all these Daniel a prophet? He said, "Yeah." Each one of them saw him what way, pastor? One saw him in the wheel, in the middle of the wheel. Is that right? One saw him in THE BURNING BUSH. IS THAT RIGHT? One saw. How are we seen them? We've seen them by the word through Malachi 4. IS THAT RIGHT? LUKE 17:30, REVELATIONS 10:7, GOD HAD TO STILL USE THE PROPHET. BUT THEN they say now his son Jesus Christ. Now it's not just prophet OF GOD. IT'S GOD WHO HAVE BECOME the prophet. Is that right? because he's the Christ. Peter testified WHO THOU ARE. THOU are the Christ, the son of the living God. Is that right? The bride, the natural bride, I mean natural Israel and spiritual Israel, which is the bride of Jesus Christ is only GOING TO ACCEPT THE PROPHET. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; HUH? That's what GIVE ME BOLDNESS. IS THAT RIGHT? TO BE ABLE TO STAND OUT THERE AND GO THROUGH THE THRONE OF GOD NOT BELIEVING BUT KNOWING. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; You know what you got. &gt;&gt; That's not anyone that came down. &gt;&gt; That was God. &gt;&gt; GOD IN SPIRIT FORM &gt;&gt; told us about that old dollar on the back of the dollar. I'm just letting him have his way. He got around there with that dollar. What do they say? Great seal. Was that [snorts] right, pastor? And he got over there and they tried to tell us when we grew up that was Illuminati, man. That's Illuminati. That eye over there. Yeah, Illuminati. Right, buddy? Had to blast that devil up the other night in one institution. Illuminati, brother. That's a pyramid, right? &gt;&gt; And the pyramid wasn't finished until Malachi 4 came. Luke 17:30, Revelations 10:7. Because Paul said, "We preach what Paul preached. We preached what Paul preached and more." Is that right? And more. &gt;&gt; Huh? We ain't taking away from Paul. We just the bride of Jesus Christ. Is that right? God is unfolding everything in this hour here now. Go to the throne boldly. You know, Brother Brandham said he loved about about the uh uh uh discernment. He said he loved discernment, pastor. He said he wanted to come around there. He said, but you know what he always wanted? He said he wanted he loved that scripture in Joshua. Moon stand still. He said he appreciated it, but he wanted more faith in the word. &gt;&gt; That's where he wanted it. He wanted it in the word. But because of the people in the time, he said to do what? He said you if you can get the people to believe [cheering] &gt;&gt; I believe that he had to move them out of Pentecost &gt;&gt; and they only was going to receive his signs. &gt;&gt; HUH? &gt;&gt; THIS GENERATION SEEKETH after what? Signs. So he gave him a three pull three pull pull of grace. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Disernment. He got over there. What? praying for the sick, then discernment, right? And then the opening of the word of the seven seal. Is that right? It was grace being extended to them. We got confidence because we don't not we don't just believe, we know. &gt;&gt; We know. &gt;&gt; Let me keep going. &gt;&gt; Let me keep going. &gt;&gt; He said, look, he says, now God first proceeded that the thought and he spoke it and it became a word. He says, "And the and the word became what?" Materialized. He says, "Now, so everything that God has spoke in his word received into the right channel." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; See, it's got to be received in the right channel. We getting somewhere in a minute because you got to understand uh faith come by hearing, hearing the word of God. Somewhere your channels getting clogged up. Is that right? Because this is the hour that what? All things are possible. Is that right? &gt;&gt; The impossible is for the impossible is possible. It's no such thing as the impossible for the believer because we can go boldly to the throne of mercy and grace. Is that right? Because the veil is ripped when he shed his blood on Calvary. Only one could go back there one time is was the high priest. Now we have a high priest oursel. Is that right? cannot be touched by the feelings of our infirmities. So when you rip the veil, [screaming] prophet God said the weakest prayer warrior can defeat the devil anywhere, anytime, any place, on any ground. Uh come on, we got to and boost that prayer life, saints. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; One of the most powerful weapons God gave us. Hallelujah. We moving. We moving. We going to bust the devil in the head tonight. Huh? &gt;&gt; Somebody going to break through. &gt;&gt; Huh? Somebody breaking through tonight. &gt;&gt; Was that right? &gt;&gt; He said, "Now look in the paragraph 43, he says. So everything that God has spoken in his word received into the right channel." He says, "Will materialize." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid to ask them. It will materialize. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; If you ask the things according to his deed, what that scripture, what did we say over there? He said, look, let me finish reading. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Let me go on and finish reading in five. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now look, I get to going. I know I ain't got much time. Y'all pray for me. I'm trying to stay in the middle of the road. If not, the wife will get me when I get home." He said, "Now look." He said, look, he he he said he said in verse 13, he said, "These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the son of God, that ye may what?" Know that ye have what? &gt;&gt; Eternal life. He says, "And that ye that ye may believe on the name of the son of God." &gt;&gt; He says, "And this is the what? &gt;&gt; Confidence." &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the confidence that we have in him &gt;&gt; that if we ask anything &gt;&gt; according to his will &gt;&gt; and he what hear us is that right he hear us he says and if we what know we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know is that right that's what give you the confidence is Because you know uh you know WHO YOU ARE. YOU KNOW where you come from. You know your father hear you all the time. You know these things. Uh we're not believing. WE KNOW we on the offense man. We have to be on the defense. &gt;&gt; Confidence in the almighty God. &gt;&gt; Why? We can only one have confidence. Why? Because everything is complete. We're in the seventh church age. Is that right? It is finished. I want you to It is finished. Had to come and he had to. That's why in this hour here now, saints son, don't be fooled by Satan's bluff. Is that right? He's a good adversary. We know that. But you got to but you got to understand God has gave us a sure word of promise. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now look verse 15. And if you know and if you know that you hear us whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the what petitions that we desire of him. Anything that you could request and you get it from God, we know God is going to do what? Bring it to his children because we asking according to his will. Come on now. Look at all these testimonies here. You know what they got, Sister Sharon? When you was on that trip, huh? I felt some of them devils didn't believe it. Huh? But that's why God allowed you to show that video up there. Is that right? God knows everything. Uh he came for you to testify. Uh when we [snorts] got over there, I was telling I was telling brother Steve was a lady that I mean a gentleman. He fly planes. He'd been flying pains planes for 50 years. Uh and I said, "Lord, I'm going to ask this man something." And when I saw him there at the institution, he was there all by himself. That I said, "That's the Lord there. That's my opportunity right there, Brother Robert." He looked around in there and I said, "I got a question for you." I said, "Do y'all see those um um um um lights and stuff up in there?" He said, "Yeah." He said, "They got what they call Blackhawks." He said, "Uned States Air Force got a group of pilots they call Blackhawks." And when they call them Blackhawks, he said they get up there and they fly. I'm going to show you the grace God gave you. He said, "When they go up there and they fly, but they can't take pictures. They won't let them take pictures of them. You understand? &gt;&gt; Cuz we know they're investigating angels. That's right. &gt;&gt; You see, they but they can't. So when you brought that there at that level, we're talking about prayer tonight, right? Remember her testimony? She prayed and asked God and went to God and made a vow to God and God let you sing that supernatural. Is that right? Come on now, brother Robin. You needed a vehicle. Is that right? We just read go to the throne boldly in the time of what need. Is that right? We need it. Is that right? We needing the finances. Is that right? For build this building. Is that right? God has been supplying the finances for build that building. Is that right? Come on now. We got our own testimony right there in the midst of us. Is that right? Look at the other things. God is providing all the things of our need. Is that right? He said, "You never &gt;&gt; never never seen the righteous forsaken or I see the what? Begging for bread." Is that right? Not his bride. Is that right? God came down and also gave us a word. There's nothing wrong with having those riches. You need the riches. Someone level of faith is there. Pray. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Pray and God will get it to you. Is that right? Because it's according to what his need. You don't have to wait until the season. This is the season. Is that right? This is the season. This is the season to be blessed. He have commanded us. He have commissioned us to bless you. Is that right? This is the hour for it. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Everything. This is the season. There's a season for what? Everything. Is that right? This is the Hear what I'm saying. Faith come by hearing. This is the season &gt;&gt; for everything. everything that you need. Uh don't let yourself uh catch a hold of that scripture. It's twofold in that scripture. &gt;&gt; Let me keep going. We going to bust this devil up tonight. Help me, Lord. He says, "So everything that God has spoken his word, receive into the right channel &gt;&gt; will materialize the word for whatever whatever the promise behind it." &gt;&gt; Right. Huh? It is. God will do it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He is obligated to do it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Then if ye abide in me and my word abide in you, then you have as God in the word in you." You see, then you have God. &gt;&gt; If the word abide in you, you have who? God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. We consist the body, spirit, and soul. &gt;&gt; And the sew is a seed. &gt;&gt; The seed is the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, I'm glad you hid it from the wise and imprudent, &gt;&gt; but you reveal it to us predestinated babes. Is that right? Hallelujah. You can't lose, saints. You can't lose. Okay, you're getting in the channel. You got to get out of that wrong channel of unbelief hanging around with carnal thoughts. Let's keep going. He said because now look, he says and believe the word. He said just as you believe God because it is God and it is inseparable. Then if you have God's word in you, you have God's life in you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. And listen what we saying. Thank you, Jesus. He says it'll have to come. Wait, you have God in you. And whatever God's word speaks forth out of you, it'll have to come to pass just like it was spoke from from God. &gt;&gt; You see, that's what Joshua did. Is that right? He told Joshua, "My servant Moses is dead." Is that right? The Lord showed us Sunday morning. Is that right? the father, the man, the father that came or the man that gave them the talents, he went off. Is that right? Hallelujah. Then we saw the quote that that was God, right? And God now was bringing it back on the what? On the church. Is that right? &gt;&gt; When the capstone came down, he's not the cornerstone. He's the capstone now. And when the capstone came down, uh Jesus said, uh, when you seen me, you seen the father. Jesus said, "You see me, you seen my body. My body and I are what? One. Is that right? We're connecting now. Is that right? We got the same virtues in there. You got the same virtue. You got faith. Come on now. We just read that. We just read that quote. If you got the seed in you, you got the word in you. You got God in you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You got faith. Is that right? Huh? Somebody come to you and ask you for prayer. Is that right? Because you got what in you? You got virtue in you. Right. You got the virtue in you. You can't the virtue of God in you. So you speak with boldness. Is that right? Because you know what's inside of you. You got knowledge. Is that right? You got knowledge of the word. Is that right? You got temperance. Is that right? You know how to handle the word. Is that right? He's teaching us faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance. What? Godliness, brotherly kindness. In between. Then we got what? The capstone. Is that right? We're in the hour. Everything is working by faith. It's working by love now. [applause] No man can't call him the Christ, &gt;&gt; but by only the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is back on the scene. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is speaking for you. The Holy Ghost going to use you. That's why he said you got five, you got two, and you got one. Is that right? And you got those talents. Those talents is for a purpose. Is that right? Every part of this bride of Christ, you have been called for a work and for a service. Is that right? Hallelujah. Let me keep going. Jesus said, "Whatever whatever you ask in my father's name," he said, "Will I do it?" &gt;&gt; He said, "Did you ever realize what that means?" [screaming] &gt;&gt; Look what's getting ready to come. Do you realize what that mean? &gt;&gt; Look what he said. He said, "Did you ever realize what that mean? You realize if we go before God &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; it's just the same as Jesus asking himself. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; He said, "Father, I know you always hear me. Huh? &gt;&gt; Say, "Father, &gt;&gt; you think the devil like this kind of preaching out there when I go in them institutions?" No. And I don't care. I got no use for him. &gt;&gt; I got no use for the devil. I've been waiting for this pastor. &gt;&gt; Just like Just like brother Martin said. Huh? Just like brother Martin said, "I've been waiting for y'all energy. I've been waiting for your energy. I've been waiting for y'all energy. I've been waiting for this energy. Is that right?" Huh? He said Jacob said, "Give me my mountain." Is that right? &gt;&gt; Give me my promise inside mine. GIVE IT TO me now. This is the season. Give me my promise inside. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Every promises is yours. &gt;&gt; Let me keep reading. I get to preach. I forgot. I ain't got 30 minutes. Help me, Lord. He said, look, he says it's just the same as Jesus himself praying. &gt;&gt; Just the same as Jesus praying. It isn't me praying anymore. &gt;&gt; It's not you praying anymore. &gt;&gt; It's Christ praying through you now. &gt;&gt; It wasn't the apostles in the book of Acts. &gt;&gt; It was the acts of the Holy Ghost through the apostles. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; We got confidence. Why? Because they got thrown they get thrown off when he say the Holy Ghost was not yet given yet. And some people saying that the Holy Ghost was there. Huh? It twisted their minds up, brother. The spirit of Elijah was on John the Baptist. It was the Holy Ghost, but it was this anointing is the anointing of Elijah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham had a different anointing. &gt;&gt; It was a covenant anointing. God had to use that body. That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; It had to be of fullness for the fullness to come in the seven church ages. &gt;&gt; WE GOT THE FULLNESS OF THE WORD. WE GOT GOD HERE HIMSELF DWELLING INSIDE OF YOU BECAUSE THE WORD IS THERE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; The devil won't come near this. &gt;&gt; He won't come near this confidence. perfect confidence cuz we got a perfect word. &gt;&gt; Look what he says. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now help me Lord if I come in his name and he recognized his name." And Jesus said, "Whatever you ask in the father's name," he says, "I do that." He says, "Then go to the father in Jesus name." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It isn't it isn't me praying anymore. &gt;&gt; It's Jesus. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; It's his spirit praying through me. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Come on now. We going to bust it. That's why I'm telling you. We going to bust them up tonight. &gt;&gt; We going to bust him up tonight. &gt;&gt; These young children got to see you. Is that right? &gt;&gt; One member of Rohia, she probably didn't believe when Peter was locked up. Brother Pastor, they was in a prayer meeting that night. &gt;&gt; Huh? When Peter was locked up, they done chopped off John the Baptist head. Peter was next. Is that right? But Peter time wasn't there yet. So they was in there in the prayer meeting. Is that right? and wrote her maybe she didn't believe. She a little girl like one of these children didn't believe. Is that right? And we going to pray into Peter. And somebody Benjamin, you came over and you said, "Keep praying, baby. We going to get Peter out of there." Huh? Keep praying. We going to get Peter out of there. Is that right? Keep praying. We going to get Peter out of there. Is that right? Maybe she the one didn't believe, but she had to go open the door. Is that right? She knew that prayer worked. Now you couldn't take it from her because it was none of prayer. It was Christ praying through them. Is that right? &gt;&gt; We went from the throne to the throne. From the holy to from the holy to the holiness. Is that right? First we came through justification, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Ghost. Uh then he takes us into what? The holiness of holy. Right. Once the veil air is ripped. Is that right? After [snorts] you got your adoption, your adoption bring your position. It places you. It positions you. Is that right? Then once you now you knew what happened on Calvary, we know what happened on Calvary. Jesus ripped the veil. Uh now we were able to go to the holiness of holies. Is that right? Because Jesus died on the cross for you and I came down. What happened? We needed a kinsman redeemer. In the garden it fell. Uh down there in the garden, you Adam and Eve what? Lost the what? The They lost the rights to the to the deed. Is that right? The abstract title deed. They lost the right to the abstract title deed. Uh but they went back to God. Is that right? Adam was put on the outside of the garden. But what do we need? We needed a kinsman redeemer. Everybody needed a kinsman redeemer. We were born in sin, shaped in iniquity, coming to the world speaking lies. We got confidence because we know it wasn't a fruit that was in the garden. Is that right? We got boldness. We can go to the throne because we know what happened there. Is that right? We got boldness. We know about the trinity. Is that right? We know how to lead someone to salvation. Is that right? We know what truly repentance is. Is that right? A godless sorrow brings a godly repentance that he doesn't have to repent of no more. Is that right? Then we know what sanctify is. Is is that right? Sanctified by the washing of the water of the word. Why? Because we had a perfect word that came in through Lutheran. Is that right? Luther justified him. Is that right? We had a word that come through Luther that would justify us. We got perfect confidence when we're leading someone through justification. Then we got over there sanctification. We had they had a perfect word in their time when Wesley was there on the scene. It was a perfect word. Is that right? Then now we came in the end. Where did we came in towards the end? The Pentecostal came. Oh my. Is that it? Ah, let me wind it up. Help me, Lord. He said, "Look, look is here. I'mma jump to the spot right here." He said, "Look." He says, "So then," he says, "It can't." He says, "And I received." Help me, Lord. He says his spirit praying through me and then I got to receive what I asked for because he said it. &gt;&gt; He said it and it's God's own word. &gt;&gt; It can not do anything else but produce just what it said. Amen. &gt;&gt; So then we believe that we and this is the confidence we have in God that we get what we ask for for he is God &gt;&gt; and cannot take back his word. He's got to stay with his word. God bless you saints. [applause] Hallelujah. Pastoral. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And amen. Confidence. want to approach him boldly before the throne tonight.

Hallelujah. I'm going to start by verse 8. 2 Kings chapter 19 verse 8. The Bible say so Rab Shak which was an officer to the king of Assyrian sent to attack Jerusalem in the time of Hezekiah. The Bible say Rab Shake returned and found the king of Assyria waring against Limbna for he had heard that he [music] was departed from Lakish. And when he heard say of Tiraa, king of Ethiopia, behold, he come out to fight against thee, he sent [music] messenger against un again unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah, king of Judah, saying, [music] Let not thy God in whom thou trusted deceived. Can God deceive somebody? No, he says, "Saying Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria. Behold, thou has heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly, and shalt thou be delivered? Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my father have destroyed as Goen, as Heron, as Raz, and the children of Eden, which were in Telasa. Where is the king of Hamoth, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharim, and Hina, and Ava? And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messenger and read it. And Hezekiah went up into the house of the Lord. So he received a bad news, a threat coming through a letter and the Bible say he went into the house of the Lord. Today we're not praying from home. We went, we came into the house of the Lord. The Bible say that Hezekiah went up into the house of the Lord and spread it before the Lord. He took the letter. He took the bad report. He took the the the the the threat that came through the messenger. He didn't call anyone. He didn't call anybody to explain the cause of what was going on. The Bible says that he went into the house of the Lord. And when he went into the house of the Lord, he spread the letter before the Lord. I don't know what's going on in your life, but you came into the house of the Lord. Whatever you have need of tonight, let's spread it. Not before a pastor, not before the deacon, not before one another, but let's spread it before the Lord like Hezekiah did. The Bible say he went up into the house of the Lord and [music] spread it before the Lord. And Hezekiah prayed before the Lord, and say, "Oh Lord, God of Israel, which dwelleth [music] between the Caribbeans, thou art the God, even thy Lord of all the kingdom of the earth, that has made heaven [music] and earth a worship. Lord bow down thine ear and hear open Lord thine eyes and see hear the words of Sarimb which has which has sent him to reproach the living God of a truth Lord the king of Assyria has destroyed the nations of the land. In other word the report [music] that came part of it is true. It is true people died with diabetes. It is true people died with cancer. It is true people die with heart problem with kidney issue but that is not the end. Let's bring it before the Lord and let's spread it in the house of the Lord. The Bible continue he says the Bible continue and say and have cast their god into the fire for they were no gods but the work of man's hand wood and stone therefore they have destroyed them. In other word, if those nation fell, they fell because the god that they worship were ado. But we are not worshiping an adult god. We are worshiping the true and the living God. Verse 19, the Bible say, "Now therefore, oh Lord God, I beseech thee, save thy eyes out of his hand, [music] that all the kingdom of the earth may know that thou art the Lord God, even [music] thou only." Then Isaiah the son of Amos sent to Hezekiah saying, "Thou saith the Lord God of Israel, that which thou had prayed to me against Sarib, king of Assyria, I have heard." He prayed in [music] the temple and God sent a prophet from somewhere to tell him that whatever you were doing in the temple in the church that night whatever you were doing the request that you brought and spread [music] before me I have heard your prayer we don't want to leave this church with our request let's bring our letter let's bring our burden let's bring our problem let's spread that before the Lord tonight but before we started it's a weeks of thanksgiving Let's all lift up our hands, our voices first. Lift up your hand if you can and let's thank [music] God first for everything that he have done for you. Throughout this entire year, you could have been dead. Accident after accident, you're still alive. Consult after consult, you're still there. Going from different places, God is still there for you. You thought you're not going to make it here. you almost toward the end. Bill behind after Bill behind. Still you alive. Still we have food. Still we have a place that we can call a home. Let's lift up our voices and pray unto the Lord. Heavenly Father, Lord, we are approaching you humbly tonight. Father, first of all, thanking you for the word that you [music] have given us tonight to use your servant to speak to us and to remind us a word of faith so that we know that when we are approaching you, we are approaching boldly the throne of grace. Not with our own Lord, Father, righteousness, but with the righteousness that you reap on the cross for us, Lord. Father, we want to worship you first and we want to also thank you, Father. Thank [music] you for everything that you have done to us in this church. Thank you for everything that you have done to each family of this church. Visible and invisible audience Lord. Father, thank you for the building project because every single step we can see your hand, the mighty hand of Jehovah being displayed in a supernatural and miraculous way. Lord, father, it's absolutely impossible for us to be able to tackle such a big job without having a big God that is alive and that is working in the midst of his children. Father, many time we were sick. Many time we were affected by the weather, but not one time did we go to the grave. Father, every single time you showed up, you come and you touch our body, you strengthen us, Lord. Father, through prayer, through medicine, or whichever way you chose, Lord, Father, to bring healing. But we can testify tonight and thank you for every single healing you brought on our way. Healing off our our spouse, healing off our children, healing off my brother, healing off my sister. Father, you have given us a job. When people, Lord, Father, are struggling to find a job. When people Lord Father are in despair, they don't know [music] what to do with this government shutdown. But by your grace and your love, Father, you have granted out to us a job, a stable job that we can go and play a Christian song and [music] be able to read our Bible and be able to pray. Father, you have given us a nam that we can support our families. Father, you have given us food on the table. Lord, you have given us clothing that we can wear.

You have been always El Shadai, the one that give us strength.

Hallelujah Lord brother. Amen. Thank you Jesus. The Bible says that God does not hear sinners. We know that we are not sinners. We are people that have been saved already by grace by the grace of God. The Bible says in the book of Jeremiah 33:3, the Bible say, "Call unto me and I will answer thee and show thee great great and mighty things which thou knowest not." But before we approach him, we want to make sure if there was anywhere [music] that we grieve the Holy Spirit somehow on our walk. We did something that we are not even aware of or maybe we stumble someone by the [music] things that we have done. We don't want anything to be an interference between us and our maker. We want to make sure [music] that whatever was done, even that which we don't remember, we want to remove any condemnation from our heart. So that when we approach God like we have been taught tonight, approach him with all boldness, knowing that our hearts are clean and that everything was put under the blood. So let's go ahead and express our repentance tonight and put everything under the blood. So we make sure nothing is going to be blocking us because there is no fellowship without the shedding of the blood. Heavenly Father, Lord, we are approaching you again, Father. Lord asking you to forgive us for everything that we grieve the Holy Spirit. Father, anything that we have done in our mind, Father, in our word, in our action, in our reaction, any meditation that was not pleasing unto any, Lord, Father, negligence in our Christian walk, Lord, Father, anything Lord Father, that we could have done and stumble someone, Lord, Father, without even being aware of, Father, anywhere, Lord Jesus Christ, that we didn't reflect you the way we were supposed to reflect you, Lord. Father, we are coming Lord as we rub the shoulder with the world asking you to forgive us Lord. Father, forgive your children. Forgive the congregation. Forgive Lord Father each one of us tonight and those Lord that have joined us with prayer online Lord. Father, I pray that the blood of the lamb may come down, Lord. Father, and sanctify our body, sanctify our spirit, sanctify our soul, sanctify our homes, Lord. Sanctify each person here, sanctify those that are streaming, Lord. Father, may your blood not only sanctify, but may the blood cover us, Lord, and wash us up completely so that we can be seen under the blood, Lord. Father, you the God that forgive every transgression, every iniquity, Lord, things that we know better not to do. And sometime we find ourselves caught up, Lord. Father, in the time of pressure that we do them, Lord, Father, we ask you to forgive us, Lord. Father, may you remove anything Lord, any word, Lord, Father, any thought, Father, any meditation, any action that have been recorded in the air, Father, your prophet told us that it takes only the blood of the lamb to wipe everything, Lord. May your blood come tonight, Lord. Father, and cleans our life completely, so that nothing can stand between us and you but the blood of the lamb. Because when you look at us through the blood, Father, we have been seen Surely pure Lord Father as the righteousness of Christ is upon us Lord. That's why we wait on one another asking you to forgive us Lord. We don't want anything to be a hindrance to our prayer tonight. We don't want oh Father any sin Lord Father be a hindrance to the prayer or the blessing of someone or the person next to us Lord. But father may you remove everything even that which we don't remember we can't recall now like David spoke one time of presumptious sin father forgive us for anything remove it completely so that lord father our heart can be lord father feel free and lightened lord father in your presence knowing lord father that we are approaching a father a father who is our maker who is our creator and our husband lord father we asking you tonight Lord May you forgive us father in the name of Jesus Christ Jesus precious name.

You have given us your spirit and your presence is already here. That's why we didn't want to invite you because You were already welcome into this place Lord because Lord Father we don't want to pray only with understanding but we want to pray into the spirit Lord so that the spirit can take over and express things in the better way than Lord father which we can express with our own mind. Lord, we worship you because you are God and there is no God that is like you and your name is the Lord Jesus Christ. Father, you're the one that have created everything and there is nothing that existed without you being the creator Lord. Father, you are the word that was the logos that came out of God.

Hallelujah. Thank you Jesus. Receive all the worship from your children tonight as you have given us this privilege to approach you to pour our heart and to express Lord Father to communicate to commune with you tonight. Father, we want to spread every burden that we have before you. You're the husband of the bride. You're the one that took all responsibility and the government set up stand upon your should where you are whether you sitting or kneeling or standing. Take this time and talk to him about your problem. Hezekiah has his problem. He went into the house of the Lord. He spread his problem before the king. before the Lord, before the living and the true God. And God answered him and brought him deliverance. God is still the same yesterday, today, and forever. Now, it's your time to ask because he say, "Ask and it shall be given to you." He spoke to us that he's the rich God. He's the God that can supply our every need according to his riches in glory. Whether it's a [music] spiritual need, whether it's financial need, whether it's a material need, whether it's a physical need, whatever need it is, this is your time to express yourself and to talk to your maker and ask him what you want. Ask him boldly. Ask him abundantly. Ask him because He's the God that answers prayer. And before we even speak, he already heard and he knows. But he want to hear. He loves to hear his children because our prayer David say [music] it is his delight. God want to hear you talking to him. Lift up your voice and speak to him tonight. Father as you [music] spoke to us to come boldly before you in the name of Jesus Christ are we coming before you Lord because you spoke to us that when we come in that name it is exactly like you yourself speaking and praying father Lord Lord, there is no beautiful name, no name that is above all name but that name and we are entering in with our request in that name in the name of Jesus Christ. Father, you call us to a great work. The hour is [music] very late and the history of the nation is just about to close. [music] And father, it doesn't take the wisdom of a man because the wisdom of a man proved completely to fail. Man have been into the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and brought death into the human race and death has been the sentence. And even the anointing that is Lord Father going upon the world now is an anointing of death. But father heaven was turned loose. Lord, you pour down yourself in the fullness of your word. And you have given us, Lord, Father, such a great responsibility as 11 worker hours, Lord, in the time when you just getting ready to turn back to the Jews, Lord. And father looking at the seriousness Lord of the task we want to always come before you to humble oursel before your presence to ask you Lord Father to come and to refill us like you did the disciple Lord because without you we cannot do anything Lord Father there is not ability in us but that which you have placed in us for the work of this hour Lord [music] that's why Lord Father we are opening lifting up our cup tonight Lord asking you, oh God, that you open the windows of heaven again. May you pour down your spirit again and refill us with your holy spirit so that Lord Father, our cup can run over, Lord, and we can be able to help somebody, Lord. Father, fill us with your wisdom. Fill us, Lord, Father, because Lord Jesus Christ, we don't want to do this work and interject the human element, Lord. Father, they thought that the reasoning of a man brought death to human race, Lord. But Father, we want to be completely surrendered unto the leadership of the Holy Spirit as you spoke through Brother Brham that you are the one that surrender him Lord unto you, Lord. Father, may you surrender me. May you surrender spoken word. [music] May you surrender every family present here. May you surrender those that are online, Father, to you, Lord. Father may we leave everything that is contrary to your word. Every sin that Lord Father easily beset us. Any Lord Father weight that we carrying up Lord. Father may you cut them loose tonight Lord by the power of the Holy Spirit. Lord we pray that you come down and fill our body, fill our spirit, fill our soul, fill every cell of our body with your presence, Lord. Father, your prophet [music] say that this body are made by cosmic light. But he spoke he said that if cosmic light can be pushes and eternal light can enter in father things will begin to take place Lord. Lord, that's what we asking in the name of Jesus Christ. Father, that eternal light, the light of God, the pillar of fire may come down tonight, Lord. Father, every young man present tonight. Father, MAY THE BAPTISM OF FIRE COME DOWN AND BURN EVERYTHING THAT IS CONTRARY to your word that is not like your divine nature. Anything Lord, any curses as you spoke on Sunday from our families Lord, any trait, Lord, any weaknesses that the devil continue to use all the time to bring your CHILDREN DOWN, FATHER, BURN THEM UP BY THE POWER OF THE Holy Spirit and the Holy Fire of God [music] in the name of Jesus Christ. Lord, may your light quicken the predestinated seed tonight. [music] May you fill my family. May you feel my children. May you fill every young man here. May you come down Lord Father Lord and penetrate every avenue, every aspect of our life, any room, Lord, Father, of our houses, Lord. Come, come and feel because you spoke in your word that it's [music] not by might, it's not by power, but it takes the Holy Spirit. Lord, we learned from a long time that Lord, [music] Father, we cannot do anything on ourself. That's why we asking you to come and move me aside. Be the pastor of this church. Be the [music] deacon of this church. Be the trustee of this church. Be the musician of this church. Be the treasurer of this church. Be the song leader of this church. Be the congregation of this church. Visible and invisible. Be the technician in this church. So that everything, everybody can be Lord anointed by your spirit Lord. and not only anointed but filled by your spirit. Father, Lord Jesus Christ, I recall on the day of Pentecost, there was 120 people that gathered together in the upper room, not one of them left the building without the Holy Ghost. Father I pray that tonight Lord as we coming into your presence we can ask many things but the most important things Lord I'm asking for myself and for this church Lord father for the children the young men so father is for you to come down and fill like in the day of Pentecost we fill us with your Holy Spirit fill those Lord Father that don't have it fill them completely until Lord Father they cup run over until Lord Father will be a church where young men are directed by [music] the Holy Spirit. Young sisters are directed by the Holy Spirit. Where the ties of the world will be completely removed, completely cut off. Lord Father [music] removed completely taken off from the young man. That worldliness can remove can be the grip of worldliness can completely be away from us Lord. But Lord father so wherever where they going in the school in the university in our work we may reflect you. We may be Lord [music] father that living a piece because the word with the dynamic is what is needed [music] Lord. Father you say that you sent your word and your word will now return to you for it. And father the word is coming every time. And Lord Father we trust in you. We are asking for a [music] rain tonight to water. Water Lord Father. Water the families. Water Lord Jesus Christ. Because when your presence enter in Lord Father, not only will it quicken the body, not only will it quicken the predestinated seed, but even the body will be quickened so that high blood pressure will leave. [music] So that high cholesterol will leave so that allergies will begin to depart. So that any trouble, any malfunctioning of the body can be corrected by the supernatural presence of the living [music] God in a supernatural temple that has been redeemed by the blood of the lamb. Oh God, help us. [music] Help us father. Help us Lord. [music] Help us father. Hallelujah Lord. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Father, may you be merciful Lord. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. [music] Help us father, help this church. Help your children, father. Help the family. Help the mother. [music] Help the father. Help my sister. Help my brother. Help the children. Father, hear our [music] prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Father. Hallelujah. Father, [music] look at our parents. Look at our biological families. people that don't know you yet. Help. Hallelujah. [music] Help us God [music] in the name of Jesus Christ. [music] Father, I [music] pray you spoke in your word that's where two [music] or three are gathering your name. Lord, you will be in the midst of it. Lord, [music] we are joining our brother and our sisters as a shepherd in their prayer tonight. Lord, [music] Father, whatever need they going through, whatever situation has been so hard and seems impossible in their life, [music] Lord, please may you grant it unto them. May you grant it unto them. Father, you spoke [music] tonight that nothing is impossible unto them. Lord, I pray Lord that you open up the windows of heaven. You're the God that can supplier.
