[0:00] pretty much lived his life out in sin.
[0:03] But once he had heard of the Bible and
[0:06] God and he lay dying
[0:10] and he said, "Is there one person
[0:15] that could talk to me about the Bible?"
[0:18] Or, "Is there one Bible on my ship?" You
[0:21] wait a long time. Think about that. But
[0:24] God's full of mercy, grace, and they
[0:27] found a boy that they had picked up on
[0:31] the ship and he had a Bible
[0:35] and he told him, he said, "Come in, son,
[0:38] and sit down by my bed and read me that
[0:40] Bible."
[0:42] And the young lad turned to Isaiah 53:5.
[0:46] And it reads like this. He was wounded
[0:49] for our transgressions.
[0:51] He was bruised for our iniquity. The
[0:54] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[0:57] and with his stripes we were healed.
[1:00] The little boy turned and he said,
[1:03] "Captain, sir," he said, "Yes, lad." He
[1:07] said, "Let me read it the way my mama
[1:09] used to read it to me."
[1:12] Said, "I read you the way it's wrote in
[1:14] the Bible, but here's the way that mama
[1:18] used to read it to me." Said, "Go ahead,
[1:21] son. Read it the way your mother read
[1:22] it. Said mama used to set me up on her
[1:24] knee and read. He was wounded for Willie
[1:28] Puit's.
[1:31] He was bruised for Willie Puit's
[1:33] iniquity.
[1:35] The chastisement of Willie Puit's peace
[1:37] was up on him and with his stripes will
[1:41] prove
[5:16] Heat. Heat.
[6:18] Can we stand this morning?
[6:24] Let's go to him a few minutes
[6:27] before we uh sing.
[6:30] Just ask him to come in our midst. Amen.
[6:34] Thank you, Heavenly Father.
[6:36] I want to give you all the glory, the
[6:38] honor, and the praise, Lord. That you're
[6:41] so worthy, Lord. That you're so ded,
[6:42] Lord God.
[6:44] Lord God, we've gathered once again in
[6:46] thy precious name, Lord Jesus, to sit in
[6:49] your midst, Lord, and to hear from the
[6:51] throne this morning, Lord God. And we
[6:53] thank you, Father, for what you're doing
[6:55] in each and every life, Lord, for your
[6:57] love and your mercy and your grace, Lord
[6:59] God. We thank you, Father.
[7:02] Lord, it's time now, Lord, that we just
[7:04] want to lift you up in song, Lord God,
[7:06] as we tell the soul, Lord, that the sea
[7:09] may fall in good ground this morning,
[7:10] Lord Jesus. We ask that you bless each
[7:13] one here present, Lord God, and each one
[7:15] that's streaming, Lord Jesus. Be with
[7:18] each one, Lord.
[7:20] Come to manifest yourself to us, Lord,
[7:23] as that word comes forth this morning,
[7:25] Lord. Touch our pastor, Lord God, and
[7:28] just bring us to new heights this
[7:30] morning, Lord God, in the pres presence
[7:32] of the the Holy One, Lord Jesus.
[7:35] Bless our musicians this morning, Lord
[7:37] God. Bless our singers, Lord Jesus.
[7:40] Bless our technicians this morning, Lord
[7:42] God. We want everything to be perfect
[7:44] for you, Lord Jesus. And everything that
[7:47] is sung, Lord, and everything that is
[7:49] spoken, Lord, just give glory, Lord God.
[7:53] There's no one like you, Lord Jesus. We
[7:56] love you with all our heart, Lord.
[7:58] You're everything to us, Lord God. And
[8:00] we just want to try to express our
[8:02] gratitude, Lord, and our love to you
[8:04] once again this morning, Lord God.
[8:07] Forgive us of our shortcomings and
[8:08] iniquities, Lord God, that we can enter
[8:10] in, Lord Jesus, and fellowship and
[8:13] commune with you this morning, Lord God.
[8:16] Give us this day, Lord, our daily bread,
[8:18] Lord God. How precious it is to us, Lord
[8:21] Jesus, that we sit with you, Lord God,
[8:24] and we hear your word, Lord Jesus.
[8:27] So give us strength, Lord. Give us of
[8:30] that power this morning, Lord. Let us
[8:33] magnify your name this morning, Lord
[8:35] Jesus, in everything that we do, oh Lord
[8:37] God, and say we thank you, Father. Bless
[8:41] each one that's here, Lord. This
[8:42] congregation is a precious people, Lord
[8:45] Jesus. We've gone through a lot
[8:47] together, Lord God. And it's made our
[8:49] bond stronger, Lord Jesus. But it's all
[8:52] for you, Lord God. It's not for each
[8:54] other as it is, but it it's all for you,
[8:57] Lord, because when I look at these
[8:59] brothers and sisters, Lord God, I see
[9:01] Christ, Lord Jesus. I see Jesus Christ
[9:04] in each one. So we thank you, Father.
[9:08] Bless every portion of this service,
[9:10] Lord, as we give it back to you, Lord.
[9:13] We thank you, Lord. Bless those that are
[9:14] still in route as well, Lord. Take
[9:16] control, Lord. Get them here safely,
[9:18] Lord God. We thank you, Father. Jesus
[9:21] Christ's name. We thank you, Father.
[9:24] Amen. And amen and amen.

[22:14] tired.
[22:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:17] &gt;&gt; I want to sing one more. I don't know if
[22:19] we've uh I don't know when we sang this
[22:22] last,
[22:26] but you know, the pastor comes out when
[22:27] he prays and he says,
[22:31] "Thank you for your love and your mercy
[22:33] and your grace."
[22:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And there's a song
[22:37] I saw love, mercy, and grace when we
[22:40] looked on his face that first time. And
[22:42] and every time after, that's what he saw
[22:45] or we saw in our lives. Amen.
[22:49] &gt;&gt; So, y'all help us. I know some of you
[22:51] know it.
[22:54] Go ahead and play it one time.
[22:57] It's a sweet little song. It's very
[22:59] simple. It's very short.
[23:03] I saw love,
[23:07] mercy,
[23:09] and grace.
[23:15] &gt;&gt; I saw love,
[23:20] mercy,
[23:23] and grace.
[23:29] might be
[23:33] his beauty.
[23:36] I look on
[23:40] his face.
[23:43] I saw love,
[23:47] mercy,
[23:50] and graceless
[23:53] again.
[23:56] I saw love
[24:00] mercy.
[24:10] I love
[24:14] mercy
[24:17] and
[24:23] my
[24:27] is
[24:36] I Oh God,
[24:40] mercy.
[24:49] Let's give him a clap offering this
[24:50] morning.
[24:56] You know, when we get to actually see
[24:58] him face to face, it's it's just hard.
[25:01] You know, there's a song I can hardly
[25:02] imagine that doesn't touch it. Amen.
[25:05] Y'all can be seated for just a minute. I
[25:07] do have um a couple of praise reports.
[25:10] My daughter has a um testimony that
[25:13] she'd like to give and we do have a
[25:14] couple of prayer requests as well. So um
[25:18] first
[25:21] um before she comes up, I snuck down to
[25:24] South Carolina this week and saw my
[25:26] buddy that we've been praying about over
[25:28] the pancreatic cancer. He was sitting in
[25:31] a little gas station with a another army
[25:33] guy. We're not army, but he the other
[25:36] guy was he's a friend and um they was
[25:39] eating some fried chicken. So, he looks
[25:42] really really good.
[25:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. I mean, you look at him and he and
[25:47] he made that statement. I wanted when if
[25:49] people look at me, they don't see this
[25:51] thing on me. So, we prayed, all three of
[25:53] us, we prayed right there in that gas
[25:55] station and uh for both of them because
[25:58] the other man said, "I I got issues,
[26:00] too." He was 35 year army vet.
[26:03] So, so, um, we just joined hands and
[26:06] took our hats off and bowed our heads
[26:07] and just prayed right there. And, um,
[26:11] I'm waiting on the testimony.
[26:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Rebecca, come on up. Let me read
[26:16] these prayer requests as you come up for
[26:18] your testimony. Um, so I got one here
[26:21] from um,
[26:23] uh, Brother Hamilton. You didn't sign
[26:26] it. Is it is that okay? Yeah. Okay. Um,
[26:30] he he wants prayer for his grandma.
[26:32] She's and I had this problem, brother,
[26:34] with my own mama. She was living with
[26:36] us. She's she's leaving her home at
[26:38] night and kind of wandering around
[26:41] among other things. He says, "We're
[26:43] trying to get her out of the house and
[26:44] move her into a family member's house,
[26:46] but she's an old fighter." And brother
[26:48] Hamilton put at the bottom, he knows God
[26:51] will answer his prayers. And that's the
[26:53] truth. That's the truth. And we'll be
[26:55] praying with you, brother. We get it. We
[26:58] understand. and and uh tears at your
[27:01] heart. Brother Greg sent me something
[27:04] yesterday. He's been posting stuff on
[27:05] Deep Water. Um and I had no idea it was
[27:08] about Nikki, Brother Nikki Charik, but
[27:10] you know, we saw videos of everything
[27:12] that Brother Nikki had attained, his
[27:14] gardens and his chickens and and
[27:16] everything. Well, he lost everything in
[27:18] a wildfire this week. Every everything
[27:21] is gone.
[27:23] And so, um,
[27:26] I think, uh, his dad is okay because his
[27:29] dad wasn't where the fires were. Is that
[27:31] correct? He was living in a in a
[27:33] different place at the time, which is
[27:35] good. So, but, uh, it's a big total loss
[27:39] for Brother Nikki. So, um, they're
[27:41] seeking prayer, probably seeking some
[27:43] some help otherwise. And, um, we just
[27:46] want to, um, put it in God's hands. come
[27:50] on up and give your testimony,
[27:55] &gt;&gt; y'all. Um, so I would just like to share
[27:58] this after the sermon we had on
[27:59] Wednesday night. Um, on Thursday at work
[28:02] while the patients were sleeping, I was
[28:04] listening to a documentary of the
[28:06] catacombs of the martyrs that are in
[28:08] Rome. And if you've never seen what it
[28:10] looks like down there, it's the darkest
[28:12] and spookiest looking place full of
[28:14] bones all around, which I believe was to
[28:16] scare the enemy away. But the guy on
[28:19] there was explaining how that there are
[28:21] paintings on the walls that depict the
[28:23] Hebrew men in the fiery furnace and the
[28:25] other known men from thousands of years
[28:27] ago such as Jonah, Daniel, Lazarus, and
[28:30] Noah. As many times as I've read though,
[28:33] Fox's Book of Martyrs and other similar
[28:35] stories and seen similar documentaries,
[28:37] I never knew those paintings on the
[28:39] walls existed before. I just wanted to
[28:42] say that even down in the city of the
[28:44] enemy in what seems like the darkest
[28:46] place on earth, the Christians of those
[28:49] times had the vision to encourage
[28:50] themselves to look ahead in the battle.
[28:56] &gt;&gt; Let's stand this morning.
[28:59] I'm sure we all have a an unspoken on
[29:02] our record on our hearts. Charles, if
[29:04] you don't mind, brother.
[29:09] All right, family. Let us pray. Lord
[29:12] Jesus, we thank you heavenly father Lord
[29:14] for another opportunity Lord God to come
[29:17] together Lord God and to praise you Lord
[29:19] God to give you thanks Lord Jesus Christ
[29:22] to have everything Lord out of our minds
[29:24] Lord God a place where we can rest in
[29:26] your presence Lord God with no thoughts
[29:29] of tomorrow Lord no thoughts of after
[29:31] here Lord God just to bask in your
[29:33] presence Lord God all the burdens Lord
[29:36] God all the the toils and the cares Lord
[29:38] God we just lay them at your feet now
[29:40] Father as we enter into your presence,
[29:42] Father. Lord Jesus, you know, Father,
[29:44] the desire of each and every heart, Lord
[29:46] Jesus. Lord, you know the burdens, Lord
[29:48] God, that are burning in your children,
[29:50] Father. Lord, our precious brother,
[29:52] Lord, a soldier on a battlefield, Lord
[29:54] God. He's lost everything, Father. Lord,
[29:57] we pray, Father, for your mercy. We pray
[29:59] for your grace, Father. Lord, we don't
[30:01] know what the the the the the desire or
[30:04] the the true need is, Father, that
[30:06] you're trying to do in a brother's life,
[30:08] Father, but we know that you're there,
[30:09] Father, for no thing can come upon him,
[30:12] Lord God. Nothing can happen to Job,
[30:13] Father, unless he was ready for that
[30:15] trial, Lord God. Father, strengthen your
[30:18] servant, Lord God. Lord, give him the
[30:20] spirit of wisdom and revelation, Lord
[30:22] God. And let the saints of God gather
[30:24] together, Father, and pray for this
[30:26] precious brother, Lord God, for he's
[30:27] been a blessing, Lord, to your kingdom,
[30:29] Lord God. And Father, you know the
[30:31] desires, Lord, of my heart, my family's
[30:33] heart, Lord God, pertaining to my
[30:35] grandmother, Lord. You know how to work
[30:36] it out, Father. You know how to move
[30:38] just right, Father. And we thank you,
[30:40] Lord God, for a finished work, Father.
[30:42] For before the foundation of the world,
[30:44] heavenly Father, everything that we
[30:46] could ask for was already finished, Lord
[30:48] God. Lord Jesus, we thank you, Father.
[30:50] Now, we pray, Father, for the remainder
[30:52] of the service, Lord God. We pray Lord
[30:54] that each and every heart Lord God can
[30:56] receive Lord God what they need Father
[30:59] from you Lord God. Help us to focus on
[31:01] the word Father. Help us to be attentive
[31:03] to the voice Lord God that speaks to our
[31:06] hearts on today Lord God. Father we pray
[31:08] Lord for the tithes and the offerings
[31:10] Lord God that you Lord use them for the
[31:12] furtherance of your kingdom Lord Jesus.
[31:14] Father we pray Lord for the project that
[31:16] we have ongoing Father. We see that
[31:18] faith Lord God as works expressed
[31:20] heavenly father because Lord there's a

[59:38] &gt;&gt; I want to thank everyone the trustees

[59:47] yesterday, the young man to work and

[1:00:05] everyone to be there and to be
[1:00:07] participant. Amen.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; I'm going to say this uh
[1:00:13] with a lot of respect, but truth is
[1:00:15] truth.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; So, I'm sorry I was put right where the
[1:00:20] canon is. So there is no way when I'm
[1:00:24] driving what I'm driving uh I got to
[1:00:27] follow the spirit of the Lord. So I'm
[1:00:28] saying this with a lot of consideration
[1:00:31] and with a lot of respect. Shake
[1:00:33] somebody's hand and say God bless you my
[1:00:35] friend.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mentioned to you the reason why
[1:00:45] I have to say it because I already
[1:00:46] mentioned to you that I got a I was
[1:00:49] invited to a
[1:00:51] uh a banquet, a married banquet. Uh they
[1:00:54] told me it's going to be 50 couples and
[1:00:57] they put it there on February the 14th
[1:01:00] and I was trying to my schedule is very
[1:01:03] tight but I say okay the only way I can
[1:01:05] do it is just get there
[1:01:08] uh do what I got to do and turn around
[1:01:11] and get get in a flight and come back.
[1:01:13] So, I already lined up everything and
[1:01:15] the flight, but I have to change it
[1:01:17] because I was not aware of something and
[1:01:20] uh it caught my attention later on that
[1:01:23] there was a fee
[1:01:25] that was put there. There was a
[1:01:27] participation fee that was put there on
[1:01:30] the banquet. The flyers already gone in
[1:01:33] the country. I'm saying that because
[1:01:34] it's not something in secret. It's the
[1:01:36] flyer are all over. they are going and
[1:01:39] they have to pay a certain amount to be
[1:01:41] part of the the the banquet. So the
[1:01:45] meeting so when that struck me my
[1:01:49] conscience already something in me rose
[1:01:52] up directly that I cannot be absolutely
[1:01:56] part of something like that.
[1:02:06] Sister Rof, increase my volume so I can
[1:02:08] blast the devil right here.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; I already told you I'm saying this with
[1:02:14] consideration.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; But truth is truth.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; I told the brother, I called the
[1:02:20] brother. I say I was not aware that this
[1:02:22] feast was there. I don't feel in me
[1:02:25] comfortable to be in the place where I
[1:02:28] have to deliver the gospel knowing that
[1:02:31] everybody that got in there
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; was paying a fee.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; I cannot do that.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; So they tried to work it up with uh uh
[1:02:41] the their staff to try to cancel. It
[1:02:44] didn't work up. So I told him I say the
[1:02:47] way we do it in our marriage couple
[1:02:49] meeting you don't pay anything.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; The church sponsor everything. We
[1:02:54] sponsor all the food and everything. But
[1:02:56] when we open up the door, you can come
[1:02:59] all for free.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Where wherever you are in the United
[1:03:03] States, if you want to attend our couple
[1:03:05] meeting, just give us a call. Let us
[1:03:07] know that you're coming and you will
[1:03:09] come. You don't have to pay a penny. We
[1:03:12] on part nine never paid any penny for
[1:03:15] the gospel or for anything. Amen.
[1:03:18] Brother Branham used to have meeting and
[1:03:21] brother Brham used to used to sponsor
[1:03:23] his meeting but the day of the meeting
[1:03:25] the meeting is open to everybody.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; I say so I have not gotten a quote yet
[1:03:32] where brother Brandham went to a meeting
[1:03:34] that made him uh they were making people
[1:03:38] pay for it. So if you don't have the
[1:03:40] money to do it, do it in the church and
[1:03:43] take the food out and just take the
[1:03:45] people to the church and then remove all
[1:03:47] the food, all the decoration. Bring the
[1:03:50] people to the church and let's go ahead
[1:03:52] and do it. So I have to pull back. I
[1:03:54] cancel the ticket. So I told the
[1:03:56] brother, we keep in good contact. He
[1:03:58] understood my point. He's going to
[1:04:00] continue. Uh as he continue, but he say
[1:04:02] he would try to organize another one. I
[1:04:04] say if it's the Lord's will, if you
[1:04:06] organize one in the church and no one is
[1:04:09] paying, then if it's the Lord's will, I
[1:04:11] will be more than likely to be there and
[1:04:14] to share everything the way the Holy
[1:04:17] Spirit want me to do. Amen. This gospel
[1:04:20] is without money
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; and without price.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; I do not even believe in worship in
[1:04:28] musician having concert and before you
[1:04:31] get in the concert you got to pay. If
[1:04:34] you don't have money to to rent uh the
[1:04:37] facility, don't do it.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Or go outside on the parking lot and put
[1:04:41] the instrument and let everybody praise
[1:04:43] the Lord.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Are we together? If we not careful, it's
[1:04:48] going to be a problem of money
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; and then the gift will be advertised
[1:04:52] toward money
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; and tomorrow concert here, concert here,
[1:04:56] concert here, concert here and it's
[1:04:58] money after money after money. The gift
[1:05:00] of God is not for money.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; No sir. Are we together? If it's a night
[1:05:05] of worship, let it go for free. If it's
[1:05:08] a conference for free. If it's a meeting
[1:05:11] for free, question and answer for free.
[1:05:14] Banquet for free. Marriage couple
[1:05:17] meeting for free. Young men meeting for
[1:05:19] free. Young sisters meeting for free. My
[1:05:22] brother, my sister all over the country.
[1:05:25] remove the participation FEE
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; because at the last minute you don't
[1:05:33] want somebody to say I was trying to be
[1:05:35] there and I could not get in because I
[1:05:38] didn't have diero I didn't have money
[1:05:41] amen so we respect the brother I share
[1:05:44] with him my thought and everything so if
[1:05:48] you don't see me there just understand
[1:05:50] but if everything is lined up correctly
[1:05:52] we will do it amen and a lot of respect
[1:05:55] for the brother, but I have to explain
[1:05:57] to you. And I believe the Lord allow me
[1:06:00] to get to catch this thing so we can
[1:06:03] correct it. And I pray it goes
[1:06:06] internationally to musician and
[1:06:08] everybody remove this habit of concert
[1:06:12] and fees and fees and fees and fees.
[1:06:15] Remove it. Find a sponsor to sponsor you
[1:06:18] and open up and let everybody come and
[1:06:21] get without money and without price.
[1:06:24] Everybody okay?
[1:06:28] Everybody okay?
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the invitation is open up. If
[1:06:33] you want to come to ours, just let us
[1:06:35] know that you're coming so we make room
[1:06:37] for you. But when you come with our
[1:06:39] money, with our price, you come for
[1:06:42] free. You can inform your pastor that's
[1:06:44] your responsibility. But you're more
[1:06:45] than welcome. Come on in. We will
[1:06:47] worship. We will worship together and
[1:06:50] share the things of the kingdom
[1:06:51] together. But my conscience I cannot do
[1:06:54] it. I'm so sorry. Unless one day I find
[1:06:56] the quote, but so far I have not found
[1:06:58] anything. I got scripture and I can
[1:07:01] trace brother Brandham. Even though you
[1:07:03] don't have a quote, the message have a
[1:07:05] certain vision and you can search those
[1:07:08] vision and you can see how things are
[1:07:10] going. You can tell and predict that I
[1:07:13] don't think the prophet will go into
[1:07:15] something like this.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; So don't truly brother Brandham say one
[1:07:20] of the error we do we copy copy things.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Avoid copying things from one another.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Always check by the word.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; What I'm trying to do right here, what
[1:07:31] does brother Brandham say about this?
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Not oh because preacher so and so did
[1:07:36] it. Because another elder did it. Oh, a
[1:07:38] big preacher did it. No, no, no. Even if
[1:07:40] a big preacher did it, push the brake
[1:07:43] and stop. You say, "Is this in the
[1:07:45] message?"
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; If it's not in the message, I don't care
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; how the preacher has been used, how big
[1:07:52] he is, what a big church he has,
[1:07:55] whatever influence he have all over the
[1:07:57] world. I don't care.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to get that because this
[1:08:01] is a matter of life and death.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So musician in this church never
[1:08:09] use your gift
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; for money.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Preacher in this church never use your
[1:08:17] gift for money.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; If they call you, they give you an
[1:08:20] offering. It's according to the
[1:08:21] scripture. But don't go after money.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Don't go knock a door and door and door
[1:08:27] so they can call you here, call you
[1:08:29] here, and you say 1 2 3 4 $1,000 I pay
[1:08:32] my mortgage. Uh-uh. Go find a job.
[1:08:38] Go find a job.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you're getting me. Go
[1:08:42] find a job.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; No, I'm going to get you in the United
[1:08:44] States. Brother so and so. Brother and
[1:08:46] so and said that one tip very good. H
[1:08:48] that one is having this and then before
[1:08:50] you know it's a collection of money.
[1:08:53] Somebody will stay here three month and
[1:08:55] left the church alone and he's I mean
[1:08:58] evangelize. If if if you want to stay
[1:09:01] six months somewhere, give the church to
[1:09:03] somebody else. Right.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham took the church and
[1:09:05] gave it to brother Neville.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham was free to do the
[1:09:09] work
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; of an evangelist.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; If I rub you the wrong way, be my guest.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; Because some of you are quiet. If I rub
[1:09:25] you the wrong way, I'm going to rob you
[1:09:27] again.
[1:09:29] This gospel IS WITHOUT MONEY, WITHOUT
[1:09:32] PRICE. WE ARE NOT PENTECOSTAL.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT COPING AFTER PENTECOSTAL.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; An idea might be good,
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; but be careful trying to do God a
[1:09:48] service
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; without being in his way.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Always filter by the word.
[1:10:00] Jehoshaphat got in trouble
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; trying to help a brother
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; and the brother was already off the word
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; and Jehoshaphat Jehoshaphat almost lost
[1:10:12] his life
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; AND THE PROPHET REBUKE HIM FOR that
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; I'm going to show support
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; support with your support you're going
[1:10:25] to Support the devil.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Young sister, support. Support support.
[1:10:31] You going to support the devil.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; When they call you somewhere, what are
[1:10:35] you trying to do? What does the prophet
[1:10:36] say?
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Please, my brother, I respect you. But
[1:10:39] to me,
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; because God will ask you individually
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; according to the knowledge you have.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; If you're happy and you know it, clap
[1:10:51] your hands.
[1:10:59] So, a lot of respect for the brothers.
[1:11:01] Amen.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; If you need our material, come here.
[1:11:04] We'll give you the material. There are
[1:11:05] material we can't put on YouTube because
[1:11:07] of the way we handle stuff.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; There was nothing wrong, but we were
[1:11:11] planning like doctors. Amen.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; So, prayer service on Tuesday at 700
[1:11:17] p.m. the building project. you continue
[1:11:20] to pray and Lord's willing we try to do
[1:11:22] it quickly. The treasurer told me he got
[1:11:24] everything ready. Next week you should
[1:11:26] have your taxes. Lord's willing uh
[1:11:29] receipt and everything. If you need a
[1:11:30] quote, you see me. So we already been

[1:11:48] If you do good, we finish this level of
[1:11:50] faith, then we can get deep into this um
[1:11:55] uh this parable. Amen.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; I was trying to move forward. But the
[1:11:59] Holy Spirit is unfolding another level
[1:12:01] with faith. So let's deal with that. If
[1:12:04] you do good, we do and then I get
[1:12:06] deeper.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; The best the wisest thing you should
[1:12:09] have done is go and read the whole uh

[1:15:33] pound faith and the Holy Ghost season.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost
[1:15:43] season.
[1:15:45] Amen.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.

[1:15:53] act a lot of stuff. So love will make
[1:15:56] you somebody come closer to you. It's
[1:15:59] love. So when the devil get closer to
[1:16:01] you, I'm nervous. It's love.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Uh Exodus 34 uh verse one, if you there,
[1:16:10] you can say amen. Amen.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; And the Lord said to Moses, "Do what?"
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; You the two tables of stone.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; You may be seated like to the first, and
[1:16:19] I will write upon this table the word
[1:16:23] that were in the first table which you
[1:16:26] broke. We clear?
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; I pray we can get into this today if the
[1:16:30] Lord allow. Amen.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Remember this is not the first table.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; We clear on this one.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; When you quiet, give me
[1:16:40] Remember
[1:16:43] this is not the first table.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Let's read it over.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; You would have saved yourself time. And
[1:16:50] the Lord said to Moses, you you two
[1:16:54] table of stone like to the water.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; So this is not the first table.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; This is the second table. The first
[1:17:02] table
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; written by God, shopped by God,
[1:17:07] everything designed by God and just
[1:17:09] handed to Moses.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; But the second table of of of law was
[1:17:14] not made by God.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; It took a prophet hand to chop the rock
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; to you the rock
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; with a sharp instrument.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; The vision of Junior Jackson. And that
[1:17:29] rock have to be without any word on it.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; And he take the rock to the mountain.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; And God have to interpret the thunder
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; by riding the stone upon the stone the
[1:17:41] interpretation of the thunders. Are we
[1:17:43] clear?
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Verse two. And be ready in the morning
[1:17:48] and come up in the mo in the morning to
[1:17:51] the what?
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Mount Si
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; to Mount Si. Mount Sana is called also
[1:17:56] Mount Horeb. Both of them are the same.
[1:17:58] We already went through this. So when
[1:18:00] you see Horeb Sana, it's the same thing.
[1:18:03] If you go to the book of Deuteronomy, it
[1:18:05] will say Horeb. If you go to Exodus, it
[1:18:07] says Sana. It's the same thing. Amen.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; And come to Mont Sana and present
[1:18:13] yourself there to me where
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; in the top of the mountain.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Job 2 verse uh five. And the Lord
[1:18:20] descended how?
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; In the cloud.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; So when you see the cloud, you know
[1:18:24] who's coming there. Amen.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; It is the Lord descending.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; The descending of the Lord comes with a
[1:18:30] cloud.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; The Lord descend shall descend himself
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; with a cloud.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; So when we see a cloud, it was God that
[1:18:39] came down.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; It was the coming of the Lord.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; We already went through this. And the
[1:18:50] Lord descended in the how
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; cloud
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; and stood with him there. So the Lord
[1:18:55] was standing. Revelation 10 right there.
[1:18:57] Amen.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; And proclaim the name of what?
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; The Lord.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; Are we clear so far?
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; We clear so far.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Job to verse 28.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; And he was there with the Lord how many
[1:19:14] days?
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; 40 days.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; And what?
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; 40 nights. And he did neither eat bread
[1:19:19] nor drink water. And he wrote upon the
[1:19:22] table the words of the covenant, the ten
[1:19:25] commandment. And it came to pass when
[1:19:27] Moses came down from Mount Sana with the
[1:19:30] two table of the testimony in Moses hand
[1:19:34] that he came down from the mount that
[1:19:38] Moses knew not that the skin of his
[1:19:41] face. This is the problem.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. The face. And you will see how
[1:19:46] that face goes into the parable. The
[1:19:48] skin of his face of his face shone while
[1:19:52] he talk with water.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; So God transfer some energy
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; from him into Moses
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; and Moses now begin to reflect the
[1:20:04] divine energy of God.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; In other words, Moses was in the
[1:20:08] presence of the Lord like a solar panel.
[1:20:16] Have I said something wrong?
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; He was absorbing the energy
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; and when it's night, HE CAN PUT THE
[1:20:23] ENERGY BACK AGAIN.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; So the prophet became the light.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; And notice this never happened with the
[1:20:39] first commandment.
[1:20:43] The face of Moses never shone
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; when he WENT TO PICK UP THE FIRST
[1:20:48] COMMANDMENT.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; When he WENT TO PICK UP THE FIRST
[1:20:54] COMMANDMENT, God himself made the table
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; and wrote upon the table what God was
[1:21:01] speaking. In other words, THE THUNDERS
[1:21:03] OF God were written on the stone
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; and he gave it to Moses and Moses face
[1:21:09] never shone.
[1:21:10] But when Moses CUT
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; the stone
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; and took the unwritten stone
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; back to the mountain,
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD INTERPRET THE WRITTEN STONE,
[1:21:23] the face of Moses begin to shine.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; I did this to help you to save some
[1:21:34] time. In the book of Deuteronomy chapter
[1:21:37] 9:E8 the Bible say also in what
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; forever
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; which is called also what
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; s
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; ye provoked the Lord to wrath
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; so that the Lord was angry with you to
[1:21:49] have done what
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; destroyed you
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; when I was gone up in the mountain to
[1:21:53] receive what
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; the tables of stone
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; even the table of the commandment which
[1:21:57] the Lord made with you then I abode in
[1:22:00] the mount how many days
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; 40 days
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; and what how many nights
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; 40 nights The same thing he did the
[1:22:05] second night. Amen. He said the a second
[1:22:08] time and neither did eat bread nor drink
[1:22:11] water.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Water
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; and the Lord delivered.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; You remember the delivery?
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; The faith that was once.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; And the Lord delivered unto me the unto
[1:22:25] me two tables of stone written with
[1:22:27] what?
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; The finger of God. And on them were
[1:22:30] written according to all the word which
[1:22:33] the Lord spake with you in the water
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; mount
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; out of the midst of what
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; the fire
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; in the day of what
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; the assembly.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; So what the people was he were were
[1:22:43] hearing as a thunder.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; It was actually the voice of God
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; and the voice of God was put on the
[1:22:50] table.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; So the laws that were on the table were
[1:22:55] the thunders interpreted. Amen.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; And if you notice on verse 8, Moses is
[1:23:09] saying that the Lord was angry with you.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; If you continue down, you will see that
[1:23:15] when Moses came, he destroyed them.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; AND NOBODY SAY THAT MOSES face was
[1:23:20] shining.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Nobody says that.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; WHEN MOSES CAME WITH ANGER and saw
[1:23:29] Israel with a molten calf, HE DESTROYED
[1:23:33] THE CALF. NOBODY SAW HIS FACE SHINING.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together? You can continue with
[1:23:38] this at home. Are we together?
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; BUT THIS TIME IS DIFFERENT.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; WHEN MOSES GOES INTO THE mountain
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; with the two table that he Moses made,
[1:23:49] not God.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Are we together? HE ONLY TOOK THE TABLE
[1:23:55] SO GOD CAN PUT the writing.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; In other words, God interpreting the
[1:24:00] unwritten stone.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; AT THAT TIME, THE FACE OF Moses
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; begin to shine.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; We clear so far.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; So the shining of a face
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; goes with the interpretation of the
[1:24:16] thunders
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; in a stone that is not written.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; We clear so far.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; We clear so far. Some of you are lost.
[1:24:27] We clear.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Ah, if we clear, no problem. Job to
[1:24:31] verse uh
[1:24:33] 30. And when Aaron and the ch and all
[1:24:36] the children of Israel saw Moses, behold
[1:24:40] the skin of his face did water
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; shown.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; If you notice, it's nobody mention about
[1:24:46] the skin of his hand.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:24:50] In other words, the body of Moses is not
[1:24:54] really into this.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; It's only the head.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Take your time.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; What is shining is the head.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. AMEN.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Come on now, brother.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Take your time, brother.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; What shine is the
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; head,
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; the face,
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; not the member,
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; not the body,
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; it's still the body of Moses,
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; but the shining is in the head.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; The head stone.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together? the husband,
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; the head,
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; not the body, not the brother.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Because a prophet is a son,
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; not the bride, the husband, the head.
[1:25:54] Yes, sir.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; The head of the church
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; is the one shining.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Not the body. The head.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; The head of the church.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; The head of the church.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; The head of the church.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; The head of the church.
[1:26:11] The head is shining.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; And when the head is shining, it means
[1:26:17] the interpretation of the thunders.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; We clear now.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; We clear now. AND BEFORE THIS HEAD HERE,
[1:26:30] brother Brandham have to cut the stone.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN BROTHER BRANDHAM CUT THE STONE,
[1:26:36] HE WENT ON THE WEST. THEN THE HEAD CAME
[1:26:40] UP
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; AND THE HEAD CAME UP SHINING TO TELL YOU
[1:26:44] THAT IT'S TIME FOR THE THUNDERS TO BE
[1:26:47] INTERPRETED.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; And they're NOT GOING TO BE INTERPRETED
[1:26:55] BY GOD BUT THROUGH A MAJOR PROPHET.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; A PROPHET LIKE UNTO MOSES
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; THAT HAVE THE SON IN THE HAND.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; YES SIR.
[1:27:09] Are we together?
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; We clear now.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; We clear now.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; Job to verse uh
[1:27:19] 33.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; And until Moses, Till Moses has done
[1:27:25] what?
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Speaking with him.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; He did what?
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; He put a veil on his face.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. Continue, my friend.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; But when Moses went in before the Lord
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; to speak with him,
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. He took the veil off
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; because he need to hook the charger.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; He need to expose the panel
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; to the sun
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; to begin to absorb.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; And he took the veil off until he did
[1:27:52] what?
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Came out
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; and he come out and spoke to the
[1:27:55] children of Israel that which he was
[1:27:57] water
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; commanded.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; So what Moses was absorbing was not just
[1:28:01] the energy.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; No sir. He was absorbing the word
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; and when the word got into Moses, Moses
[1:28:10] was velling the word
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; and the word begin to shine on his face.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Exactly. Right.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; So he have to come back and deliver the
[1:28:19] word
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:28:23] Use the energy
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; to supply at the body.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; So the body can come with your
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; with your charger.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; We hook it in spoken word.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; So we can hook it in our home.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; That's why we NEED TO LISTEN TO THE
[1:28:48] MESSAGE.
[1:28:50] THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO read the message.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY YOU NEED TO LET THE MESSAGE
[1:28:54] play in your home
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THERE IS POWER OF CHARGING YOUR
[1:28:59] HOME.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; It's a battery charging you.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; The Bible says verse 35, "And the
[1:29:19] children of Israel saw the face of Moses
[1:29:22] that the skin of Moses' face did what?"
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; And Moses put the veil upon his face
[1:29:27] again until he went to speak with what?
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; So Moses never veil his body because he
[1:29:34] was shining because his body was already
[1:29:37] having clothing but nothing in his body
[1:29:38] was shining. But he have to veil his
[1:29:41] skin. Right.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; He had to took I mean uh he have to take
[1:29:45] a veil
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; and put it around his head
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; clear so far.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; We clear so far?
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Everybody clear? Let's go to Luke 19.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:30:08] Glory. Glory.
[1:30:11] H since we lay we there. I'm just
[1:30:15] singing waiting on you.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; If you there you can say amen.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Luke 19. Let's go to verse 11. Now
[1:30:23] follow me carefully. I'm going to touch
[1:30:26] up so we move on. Amen.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Verse 11. The Bible says, you know this,
[1:30:32] in the house of Zakius, the rich man, he
[1:30:35] says, "And as they heard these things,
[1:30:37] what he spoke about Zakius, he added and
[1:30:40] spoke a what?"
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Parable.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; So God added something new.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; He came up with something else different
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; that he was saying. Amen.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; Because he was near what?
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Jerusalem. And because they thought that
[1:30:57] the kingdom of God should what?
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Immediately appear.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; He said, "Therefore, a certain noble man
[1:31:05] went into a far country to receive for
[1:31:09] himself a water
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; a kingdom."
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; SO THERE IS TWO COUNTRIES HERE.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; There is a country where the noble man
[1:31:20] is actually there.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And there is another country that
[1:31:25] they call what?
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; A far country.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; And we know what it means.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham already interpreted.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Far country means what?
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Heaven.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; And the country that he was in was what?
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; So we got two country. But he is right
[1:31:45] here.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; The man, the noble man is right there.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says, "And a certain
[1:31:50] noble man went into a far country to
[1:31:54] receive for himself a kingdom." He went
[1:31:56] to be transformed there.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; When he's coming back there, he's not
[1:32:02] coming back the same way he left.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; When he's coming back from there, he's
[1:32:07] coming with a kingdom.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; We clear to for your information. You
[1:32:14] already know THE NOBLE MAN IS JESUS.
[1:32:17] AMEN.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; He was the king of the Jews,
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; but he was never recognized as the king.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; But he WENT TO HEAVEN
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; SO THAT WHEN HE'S RETURNING from heaven,
[1:32:32] HE'S RETURNING AS A KING OF KINGS.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; As the lord of lord
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; in the book of revelation 19.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; Clear. Verse 13. And he called his 10
[1:32:45] servant and delivered them what?
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; 10 pounds.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; And say unto them, do what?
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Occupy till I come.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; If you notice, he didn't deliver that
[1:32:54] pound in heaven.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; We already studying, but now you slow.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; He's giving the pound right here.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; WE KNOW THAT THAT POUND MEANS MONEY.
[1:33:09] It's in your Bible. I already gave you.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Pound
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; means what?
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; And money means what?
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Purchase power means what?
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; So the pound represent what?
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; We clear.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; We clear.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that he called how many
[1:33:38] servant?
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; 10 servants.
[1:33:41] He called 10 servants.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; And he delivered them how many pound?
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; 10 pound.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; 10 pound.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; So each servant received how much?
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; One pound.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; 10 divided by 10 equal what?
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; One.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; We clear so far?
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; The 10 pound was all in him.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? BUT BEFORE HE DEPART TO
[1:34:12] THE FAR AWAY COUNTRY,
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; HE DISCLOSED HOW MUCH MONEY HE HAD ON
[1:34:17] EARTH.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; When he disclosed the money, we realized
[1:34:25] that he had£10.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; HE WAS ONE PERSON WITH£10.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together? BUT WHEN HE WANT TO
[1:34:36] GIVE THE children the servant,
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; HE COULD NOT GIVE £10 TO ONE.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; He had to divide.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Put your seat belt my friend.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; HE HAD TO DIVIDE THE£10
[1:34:55] SO THAT EVERYBODY RECEIVE A PORTION.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; I hope we together.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; I hope WE TOGETHER.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO NOW WHEN EVERYBODY receive a
[1:35:06] portion, YOU DON'T HAVE HIM ANYMORE.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; IF TWO OF YOU GATHER TOGETHER, YOU ONLY
[1:35:15] HAVE 210
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; FOR YOU TO MAKE UP HIM.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; ALL OF YOU NEED TO COME TOGETHER.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? ALL OF YOU DID NOT NEED
[1:35:33] TO COME TOGETHER TO MAKE UP ONE PERSON.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST, HE CAME
[1:35:39] DOWN.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN HE CAME, HE DIVIDED HIMSELF.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; YES, he did.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; AND A PORTION BEGIN TO GET EACH ONE.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; We clear so far.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; We clear so far. Yes.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; The point WAS WHY IS THIS parable
[1:36:00] coming?
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; THE PARABLE IS COMING BASED ON THE
[1:36:04] EXPECTATION.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; The expectation of the Jews. They say
[1:36:07] Jesus is coming.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; He's going to take the Roman out and
[1:36:11] he's going to take over and restore the
[1:36:13] kingdom back to Israel. And Jesus
[1:36:16] EXPLAINED TO THEM THEY DIDN'T GET IT. SO
[1:36:18] WHEN JESUS resurrected and HE BEGIN TO
[1:36:21] CROSS WALLS
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAY ALL POWER IN HEAVEN AND EARTH
[1:36:27] IS GIVEN TO ME.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; THE DISCIPLE LOOK THEY SAY AH NOW HE CAN
[1:36:33] APPEAR AND DISAPPEAR.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; SO WE GOT THE PERFECT TOOL.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; ALL HE HAS TO DO IS APPEAR BEHIND THE
[1:36:40] ROMAN SOLDIER.
[1:36:42] CHOP HIM, KILL HIM, AND HE DISAPPEARED
[1:36:45] AND GO TO THE NEXT ROMAN SOLDIER. KILL
[1:36:48] HIM AND HE DISAPPEARED. NOW HE'S GOING
[1:36:50] TO FINISH ALL ROME.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; SO THEY SAY THIS IS NOW THE PERFECT
[1:36:54] TIME.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; GOD IS GOING TO RESTORE THE KINGDOM.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; Follow me my friend.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; THEN JESUS HAS TO MANAGE THEIR
[1:37:05] EXPECTATION.
[1:37:07] JESUS HAVE TO CORRECT THEIR EXPECTATION
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; ACCORDING TO THE PLAN OF REDEMPTION.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, JESUS HAS TO TELL THEM
[1:37:15] YOU ARE LOOKING AT THAT WRONG.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; THERE IS STILL ANOTHER SEASON.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; THERE IS STILL YET ANOTHER SEASON BEFORE
[1:37:26] THE KINGDOM WILL BE IS RESTORED.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; HE WAS MANAGING THEIR EXPECTATION. TAKE
[1:37:34] YOUR TIME.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; In my name.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; In plan word, we trying to build a
[1:37:43] house.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; And everybody's saying, "Oh, so we will
[1:37:46] see the house coming up."
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; And brother Robert come saym, "That's
[1:37:49] not the way you work."
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; The way you work, we got to dig the
[1:37:53] foundation first.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; Take your time.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; So you need to open up your mind to the
[1:37:58] digging of the foundation
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; because if not, you going to miss the
[1:38:02] season.
[1:38:04] The season now is not to erect the wall,
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; but it's the season of the foundation.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; So Jesus WAS TELLING THEM THIS IS NOT
[1:38:11] THE SEASON I need to rain.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; This is THERE IS ANOTHER SEASON BEFORE
[1:38:16] THAT.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; Now brother Brham says this. Glory to
[1:38:22] God. Brother Brham says, Brother Brham
[1:38:25] says this. Before we get there, let me
[1:38:27] go back here in THE BOOK OF ACTS chapter
[1:38:30] 1 verse 6. The Bible say when he when
[1:38:33] they therefore were come how
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; together
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; they asked him the disciple he's
[1:38:38] disappearing and appearing SAYING LORD
[1:38:41] WILL DIE AT THIS TIME.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS AH NOW THAT YOU SAY ALL
[1:38:48] POWER
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; POWER
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; IN HEAVEN and earth is given to you.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; NOW YOU OVERCOME HELL AND THE GRAVE.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; NOW YOU CAN APPEAR AND DISAPPEAR.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; NOW EVEN IF WE SHUT THE DOOR YOU COME
[1:38:58] INSIDE. YOU SAY ALL IS WELL.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Now we see you in a different level.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; So the ANOINTING IS FLYING DIFFERENTLY
[1:39:06] NOW.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; SO IS THIS THE time
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; that YOU GOING TO TAKE THE KINGDOM
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; AND RESTORE IT BACK TO ISRAEL?
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; THIS KINGDOM THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT WAS
[1:39:18] A NATURAL KINGDOM.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; Follow me my friend.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; IT WAS A NATURAL KINGDOM. THEY WANT HIM
[1:39:26] TO BE A KING NATURALLY.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; That's exactly.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Don't worry. Until some of you will be
[1:39:33] filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; As I'm moving this way, you will catch
[1:39:38] up yourself. You are filled with the
[1:39:39] Holy Ghost.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; Don't worry. The Holy Ghost will ambush
[1:39:45] you.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; As you following, you will find yourself
[1:39:48] as the as Peter yet spake the word.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; You will find the Holy Ghost in you.
[1:39:54] So stay focused.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "LORD, WILL thou at this time
[1:40:00] restore again the water
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; the kingdom TO ISRAEL."
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAY UNTO THEM, "IT IS NOT FOR YOU
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; TO KNOW THE WATER,
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; the time,
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; all water,
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; OR THE SEASON."
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; SO THE SEVEN SEAL IS LOCKED RIGHT HERE.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; THE TIME AND THE SEASON WHICH THE FATHER
[1:40:19] HAS PUT IN WATER,
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; HIS OWN POWER. IN OTHER WORD, YOU ARE
[1:40:23] CARING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT IS NOT
[1:40:25] IMPORTANT FOR YOU. Now
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; I hope you are you are understanding me.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? IN OTHER WORDS, JESUS
[1:40:33] IS TELLING THEM WHAT YOU ASKING ME NOW.
[1:40:36] YOU SHOULD NOT BE WORRYING ABOUT IT.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; THESE ARE THINGS THAT THE FATHER HIMSELF
[1:40:41] HAVE.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; BUT THE BUT
[1:40:44] HE'S CHANGING. RIGHT.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED TO
[1:40:49] BE AWARE OF,
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; NOT WHAT YOU ASKING ME,
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; SIR.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; He says, HE SAYS, "BUT
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; YE SHALL RECEIVE WHAT
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; POWER
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; after what
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; that the Holy Ghost has come upon you."
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; In other word,
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; WHAT YOU ASKING FOR IS NOT IMPORTANT FOR
[1:41:10] YOU NOW.
[1:41:12] THERE IS ANOTHER SEASON THAT IS ABOUT TO
[1:41:15] START.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; AND THAT SEASON IS THE HOLY GHOST IS
[1:41:22] COMING.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; SO FORGET ABOUT THE NATURAL KINGDOM.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; I'M I AM RESTORING A SPIRITUAL KINGDOM.
[1:41:33] LORD HAVE YOU
[1:41:37] glory glory glory glory glory FIRST
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; DON'T WORRY we will catch up MY FRIEND
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; STAY T STOP MOVING around let's move on
[1:41:47] are we together
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; let's go again somebody didn't get it
[1:41:51] I'm going to push it until we go amen I
[1:41:54] won't let you lagging behind
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; we got to move together
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; are we together
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; the disciple are coming and they're
[1:42:02] saying Lord
[1:42:03] So we let this time that you're going to
[1:42:05] restore the kingdom.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; He say you are worrying about something
[1:42:08] that you should not be worrying now.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; What you need to worry about is this.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; In other words, this is what is going to
[1:42:17] take place first.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; Leave the other one alone.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; And notice all of them die.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; And no one have seen the kingdom
[1:42:27] restored yet. All the disciple are
[1:42:29] already dead. SO THEY WERE TRYING TO
[1:42:31] GAIN INFORMATION of something they would
[1:42:34] not be there.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. SO JESUS IS
[1:42:39] TELLING THEM YOU'RE GOING TO MISS YOUR
[1:42:40] SEASON.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN NOW IS THE HOLY
[1:42:44] GHOST IS COMING.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; Follow me.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN THE HOLY GHOST COME,
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; are we together? YOU WILL RECEIVE POWER.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT WE SAY, BROTHER.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; That's what we say.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? IN OTHER WORDS, QUIT
[1:42:58] FOCUSING ABOUT THE NATURAL KINGDOM.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; I AM NOT RESTORING THE NATURAL KINGDOM.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; I AM RESTORING THE SPIRITUAL KINGDOM.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; SO, YOU NEED TO REFOCUS YOUR MIND.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. AND BEGIN TO WATCH
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; FOR THE RESTORATION OF A SPIRITUAL
[1:43:20] KINGDOM BECAUSE THE SPIRITUAL KINGDOM
[1:43:23] MUST BE RESTORED FIRST BEFORE THE
[1:43:26] NATURAL KINGDOM. GOD MUST RESTORE YOUR
[1:43:29] SOUL FIRST
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; BEFORE HE CHANGES YOUR BODY.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; YOU WON'T RECEIVE THE BODY CHANGE IF YOU
[1:43:42] DIDN'T HAVE THE SOUL CHANGE. THE
[1:43:45] SPIRITUAL MUST TAKE PLACE FIRST THEN THE
[1:43:48] NATURAL WILL COME FURTHER.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; WE MUST UNITE YOU IN THE CHURCH FIRST
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; BEFORE YOU GET UNITED IN YOUR BODY WITH
[1:43:57] YOUR HUSBAND.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; THE SPIRITUAL ALWAYS GOES FIRST THEN THE
[1:44:02] NATURAL WILL FOLLOW.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? IF WE TOGETHER SAY
[1:44:08] AMEN.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; LISTEN TO BROTHER BRHAM.
[1:44:14] HALLELUJAH. LISTEN TO BROTHER BRANDHAM.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRHAM say in a message uh
[1:44:19] question and answer. He say he was what?
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; Crucified.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; And he did what?
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; Died.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; And what?
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; Rose the third day.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Uh and was on EARTH HOW MANY DAYS?
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; 40 DAYS among men.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; Remember 40 days. Amen. And he did what?
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; Ascended up into heaven.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; AND TAUGHT THEM TO DO WHAT?
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Wait till they seen the kingdom of God.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Wait until they see the kingdom of God
[1:44:38] come. How?
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; Upon them. At this time THE FATHER WILL
[1:44:42] RESTORE THE KINGDOM. HOW?
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; IN A spiritual form to them.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; IN A SPIRITUAL FORM TO THEM.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; THEY WENT UP TO THE CITY OF WATER.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; JERUSALEM.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; And did water
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; waited there
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; for how many days?
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; 10 DAYS.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; SO THEY HAVE TO WAIT FOR 10 DAYS BECAUSE
[1:44:57] THE HOLY GHOST CAME ON THE DAY OF
[1:44:59] PENTECOST.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; PENTECOST MEANS 50.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? JESUS ALREADY SPENT
[1:45:10] WITH THEM 40 DAYS.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; SO 50 MINUS 40.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; IT'S HOW MANY DAYS?
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; AND HOW MANY POUND DID HE LEFT?
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? I'M
[1:45:28] USING A B2 BOMBER, MY FRIEND. HOW MANY
[1:45:31] POUND DID HE LEFT?
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY DAYS DO THEY HAVE TO WAIT FOR
[1:45:35] THE HOLY GHOST?
[1:45:36] WOW.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; ARE WE COMING?
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; OKAY. BROTHER SAY FOR 10 DAYS AND WHAT?
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT?
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; ALL OF A SUDDEN
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; THE WHAT?
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; THE KINGDOM OF GOD.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST IS WHAT?
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; THE KINGDOM OF GOD.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; THE KINGDOM OF GOD COME WITH WHAT?
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; POWER UPON THEM.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; IS THAT RIGHT?
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IN THE EXPOSITION OF THE CHURCH
[1:46:02] AGES, HE SAY YOU REMEMBER THAT THEY CAME
[1:46:04] TO JESUS IN THE BOOK OF ACT and did
[1:46:07] what?
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Ask him
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; continue my friend.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; Are you at this time going to restore
[1:46:11] the kingdom to Israel
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; and he says what
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; it is not for you to know the TIMES OR
[1:46:15] THE SEASON.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; THOSE MEN WERE STILL THINKING
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; OF JESUS HAVING AN EARTHLY KINGDOM
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; BUT HE WAS A WHAT?
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; A SPIRITUAL KINGDOM
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; THAT HE WAS GOING TO DO AS
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; BUILD.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? SO JESUS IS TELLING
[1:46:30] THEM QUIT WORRYING ABOUT THIS.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; ANOTHER SEASON HAVE OPENED UP.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; IT'S A SEASON OF THE DISPENSATION OF THE
[1:46:38] HOLY GHOST.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN THE HOLY GHOST COME UPON YOU,
[1:46:45] YOU WILL RECEIVE WHAT?
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; POWER.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN YOU RECEIVE POWER, YOU WILL BE
[1:46:52] WHAT?
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; WITNESSES.
[1:46:56] YOU WILL RECEIVE power when
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; after the Holy Ghost has come upon you.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Not before,
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; AFTER THE HOLY GHOST IS GIVEN UNTO YOU,
[1:47:05] YOU WILL RECEIVE WHAT?
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; POWER.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; SO YOU CANNOT RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST AND
[1:47:10] YOUR HOLY GHOST DOESN'T HAVE POWER.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER.
[1:47:21] WE ARE CLEANING UP MESSAGE BELIEVER.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; THE HOLY GHOST. MY HOLY GHOST. UHHUH.
[1:47:27] THE HOLY GHOST GOT POWER.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; IT'S a powerful spirit.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; IT'S A SPIRIT AND A FIRE.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; YOU SHALL RECEIVE POWER WHEN
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE HOLY Ghost has come upon YOU
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; AND YE SHALL BE WHAT?
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; WITNESSES. YOU CANNOT BE A WITNESS IF
[1:47:51] YOU DON'T HAVE THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; MANY YOUNG MEN IN THIS MESSAGE WENT
[1:48:02] THROUGH A WRECK
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY TRIED TO PREACH THE GOSPEL
[1:48:06] WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; OH, WE GOING TO TESTIFY. WE GOING TO
[1:48:10] TESTIFY. AND A YOUNG MAN IN A BUNCH OF
[1:48:14] WORLDLY WOMEN,
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, HE'S ON TOTAL LOSS.
[1:48:18] BECAUSE BEFORE YOU TESTIFY, BEFORE YOU
[1:48:21] WITNESS, YOU MUST HAVE THE POWER.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; THE POWER THAT HELP YOU GET IN OUR RAIN.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; DROP THE BOMB AND YOU COME BACK SAFE
[1:48:30] HOME. LORD,
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN GO INTO THE ENEMY CAMP AND DROP
[1:48:36] THE BUNKER BOMB AND YOU CAN COME BACK
[1:48:39] AND RETRIEVE BACK AND YOU ARE SAFE
[1:48:42] BECAUSE YOU ARE ALL BLESSING
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; WITH THE FIRE OF THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:48:53] ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "YOU SHALL BE WITNESS WHERE?"
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; UNTO me
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; where?
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; Both in Jerusalem.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; In Jerusalem
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; and what?
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; And in all Judea.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; In Judea.
[1:49:08] Jews.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; And what?
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; And in Samaria.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; Samaria.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; Samaritan.
[1:49:18] Is my Bible different?
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; And then what?
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; And unto the uttermost part of the
[1:49:24] earth.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; GENTILES.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; OUT THE MOST IS WHO?
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; GENTILES.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; SO THE GOSPEL MUST BE PREACHED TO WHO?
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; JEWS, SAMARITAN,
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; GENTILE.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORD, YOU ARE YOU NEED TO GET
[1:49:41] IN THE SEASON. THE SEASON IS THE HOLY
[1:49:44] GHOST WILL COME AND THE GOSPEL MUST GO
[1:49:47] EVERYWHERE
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; BEFORE THE RESTORATION. THE GOSPEL MUST
[1:49:55] BE PREACHED TO THE JEWS,
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; TO THE GENTILE, AND THEN TO THE
[1:49:59] SAMARITAN. IF NOT, I WON'T RESTORE THE
[1:50:01] KINGDOM.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I MUST RESTORE THE KINGDOM IN
[1:50:05] EVERY LEVEL
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I GOT CHILDREN THAT ARE JEWS.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; I GOT CHILDREN THAT ARE SAMARITAN. BUT I
[1:50:12] ALSO GOT CHILDREN IN GASTONIA, NORTH
[1:50:15] CAROLINA THAT ARE GENTILE AND I CANNOT
[1:50:19] RESTORE THE KINGDOM IF THOSE CHILDREN
[1:50:21] ARE NOT RESTORED BACK.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; Jesus will not come back to be king.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. If you are not restored,
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; you the ONE THAT IS BLOCKING THE
[1:50:41] RESTORATION OF ISRAEL.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; THE SEVEN SEAL IS BLOCKED HERE
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; BEFORE HE GOES TO THE JEWS.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; THE JEWS WON'T BE BORN AGAIN UNTIL WE
[1:50:53] CHANGE.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; The three category was given there.
[1:51:03] Amen.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says that when he when he
[1:51:06] has spoken this thing, he did what?
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; While they beheld,
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; he was water.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; He was taken up.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; How?
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; And a cloud received.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; So when he's coming, he's coming. How?
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; He was taken up. How?
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; WOW. HE'S COMING. HE'S COMING with what?
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; I hope WE TOGETHER. IN OTHER WORD, WHEN
[1:51:33] HE FINISHED, HE TOOK THE JOURNEY.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; HE GOT IN THE AIRPLANE AND THE AIRPLANE
[1:51:39] CLOSED.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; SEE YOU LATER ON.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; BUT REMEMBER, THE HOLY GHOST IS COMING.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; We clear.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; We clear. THE BIBLE SAYS IN THE BOOK OF
[1:52:00] MATTHEW THAT AND THIS GOSPEL OF THE
[1:52:03] KINGDOM SHALL BE how
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; preached
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; where
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; in all THE WORLD
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; FOR A WHAT?
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; A witness
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; unto what?
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; ALL NATIONS.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; AND THEN SHALL THE END
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; COME.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; THE END CANNOT COME
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; IF THE GOSPEL IS NOT GOING TO EVERY
[1:52:18] NATION.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together? YEAH.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; SO REMEMBER NOW THE £10, HE DIDN'T have
[1:52:27] that in heaven.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; He has that water.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; He had it TO HIMSELF.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; BUT BEFORE HE DEPARTED,
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; HE TOOK THE MONEY HE HAS.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; AND HE PASSED TO THE SERVANT.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; He gave it TO THE SERVANT.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; HE NEVER GAVE THEM UNTIL HE WAS GETTING
[1:52:50] READY TO GO.
[1:52:52] SO HE WAS CHANGING MINISTRY.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER BECAUSE MONEY
[1:53:05] REPRESENT WHAT
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; AND HE CAME WITH FAITH
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; AND HE WAS THE FAITH.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; Are we together
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; my friend? LET'S PAY ATTENTION.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAY IN GALATIAN BUT BEFORE
[1:53:18] WHAT
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; FAITH CAME. COME ON.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; SO FAITH WAS NOT THERE.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; THAT FAITH IS NOT JUST THE FAITH YOU
[1:53:26] THINKING OF.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE FAITH OF A PERSON.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; BEFORE FAITH CAME, WE WERE HOW
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; KEPT UNDER THE LAW.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; SO WE WERE UNDER THE LAW UNTIL JESUS
[1:53:35] CAME.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; IT IS JESUS THAT BROUGHT FAITH.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; And when HE WHEN HE UNVEILED THE FAITH
[1:53:44] HE HAD,
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; THE FAITH IS 10 POUND. AMEN.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; IT'S A 10B FAITH.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; 10B FAITH.

[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; AND START WHAT?
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; COUNTING.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; 10 IS A BAD NUMBER.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; Put your seat belt, my friend.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; Put your seat belt, MY FRIEND.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; 10 IS A GOOD NUMBER.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; NO.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY POUND DID HE DELIVER?
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; 10.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; AND POUND REPRESENTED WHAT?
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; MONEY.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; MONEY. MONEY REPRESENTED WHAT?
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY 10 IS A WHAT?
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; BAD NUMBER.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; THAT IS RIGHT. START WITH 10. IT'S A
[1:54:44] WHAT? A BAD NUMBER.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; THEY HAD HOW MANY TRIBE?
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; 10 TRIBES OF ISRAEL.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; AND THEN THEY WERE HOW?
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; CARNAL.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; SO 10 IS A NUMBER OF CONNALITY.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; BUT BEFORE HE GOES, HE TOOK£10.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, HE DELIVERED THE FAITH
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; THAT IS EQUIVALENT TO YOUR ENEMY.
[1:55:14] Some of you DIDN'T GET IT. HE HE GAVE
[1:55:18] YOU THE FAITH TO OVERCOME THE CORNER
[1:55:21] NATURE.

[1:55:53] CARE OF YOUR COUNTER PROBLEM.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN

[2:18:44] BECAUSE THE CARNAL MIND
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; OUR MIND
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL IS WORKING EVERYTHING
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; TO CONVINCE YOU THAT YOU ARE LIMITED.
[2:18:57] TO TELL YOU YOU CAN ONLY GO SO FAR.
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS THIS.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; IF YOU CAN LIMIT WHO?
[2:19:10] &gt;&gt; GOD.
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; You can limit who?
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; Christ.
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE CHRIST AND GOD ARE WHAT?
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; ONE. AND IF YOU LIMIT THE CHURCH TODAY
[2:19:20] &gt;&gt; IN ITS POSSIBILITY, YOU ARE LIMITING
[2:19:24] GOD.
[2:19:28] &gt;&gt; You didn't get it.
[2:19:29] &gt;&gt; Let's read it again.
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:33] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, WHEN I TALK ABOUT GOD AND
[2:19:35] CHRIST, YOU WERE all saying, "Amen."
[2:19:37] Now, when it come to YOU, YOU BACK UP.
[2:19:40] THIS IS THE THING I'M FIGHTING WITH
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE GOT TO BE CHANGED
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; AND WE NEED A HIGHER FAITH.
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; THE BROTHER PRANAM SAY IF YOU CAN LIMIT
[2:19:50] WHO?
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; GOD,
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; you can limit who?
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; Christ.
[2:19:53] &gt;&gt; And if YOU LIMIT THE CHURCH,
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; NOT GOD.
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; THE CHURCH TODAY IN ITS WHAT
[2:19:59] &gt;&gt; POSSIBILITY.
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE LIMITING WHO?
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; GOD.
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WAY, YOU BEGIN TO BLOCK GOD.
[2:20:05] BECAUSE THE CHURCH IS GOD PIPE.
[2:20:08] GOD IS CHANNELING EVERYTHING THROUGH THE
[2:20:10] CHURCH.
[2:20:15] &gt;&gt; My friend,
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; WHEN I SAY CHURCH, your mind, your
[2:20:19] corner mind is looking at spoken word.
[2:20:21] Forget spoken word.
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; IF THEY LIMIT YOU,
[2:20:26] &gt;&gt; YOU THEY ARE LIMITING GOD. YOU ARE GOD
[2:20:29] PIPE.
[2:20:37] I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GETTING ME.
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE GETTING ME.
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; Who carried the pregnancy?
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; The man or the woman?
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; The woman.
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; So the man have to take his baby and put
[2:20:48] it in a woman
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; and the woman has to express.
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; If you block the woman, you blocking
[2:20:52] who?
[2:20:54] &gt;&gt; IF YOU BLOCK THE CHURCH, YOU BLOCKING
[2:20:55] WHO?
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD WANT HIS BABY TO COME
[2:20:58] THROUGH THE CHURCH.
[2:21:01] GOD WANTS THE CHURCH TO BE UNLIMITED
[2:21:04] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE CHURCH IS GOD.
[2:21:08] &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING THAT WAS IN GOD, HE PLE AWAY
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; IN HIS CHURCH.
[2:21:11] &gt;&gt; AND EVERYTHING THAT WAS IN CHRIST, HE
[2:21:13] PLE AWAY.
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; SO THE CHURCH MUST BE HOW?
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; YES SIR.
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER.
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER.
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:21:23] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS IF YOU CAN LIMIT GOD, YOU CAN
[2:21:25] LIMIT WHO?
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; CHRIST. IF YOU CAN LIMIT THE CHURCH
[2:21:28] TODAY IN ITS POSSIBILITIES, YOU ARE
[2:21:30] LIMITING WHO?
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; GOD.
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; BUT ALL things
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; whatsoever.
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; CAN YOU READ?
[2:21:39] &gt;&gt; WHATSOEVER WHAT
[2:21:40] &gt;&gt; YOU DESIRE.
[2:21:41] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU WHAT?
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; PRAY
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; BELIEVE YOU RECEIVE IT AND YOU SHALL DO
[2:21:45] WHAT?
[2:21:45] &gt;&gt; HAVE IT.
[2:21:46] &gt;&gt; HE SAID THAT.
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE IT AND I KNOW IT IS WHAT?
[2:21:51] &gt;&gt; THE TRUTH.
[2:21:56] I TOLD YOU I'M TAKING FAITH TO ANOTHER
[2:21:58] LEVEL.
[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; WHY did he LEAVE THE CHURCH?
[2:22:02] &gt;&gt; FAITH IS EVERYTHING.
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; FAITH ANSWER FOR EVERYTHING.
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; Faith is unlimited.
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; Not only that, my friend,
[2:22:10] &gt;&gt; let's look at this, my friend. THE BIBLE
[2:22:13] SAYS, "FOR WHATSOEVER IS WHAT?
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; BORN OF GOD
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; DOES WHAT?
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; OVERCOMETH THE WORLD."
[2:22:19] &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS THE WHAT?
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; VICTORY
[2:22:21] &gt;&gt; THAT DOES WHAT? THAT OVERCOMETH THE
[2:22:23] WORLD.
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE VICTORY THAT OVERCOME WHAT?
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; The world.
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; Cosmos.
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; The victory THAT OVERCOMETH THE WORLD IS
[2:22:34] WHAT?
[2:22:35] &gt;&gt; OUR FAITH.
[2:22:36] &gt;&gt; Our faith.
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; So when God give you faith,
[2:22:42] &gt;&gt; HE ALREADY GAVE YOU THE VICTORY.
[2:22:53] You don't get it, my friend.
[2:22:55] &gt;&gt; You don't understand, my friend.
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; If you understand what I'm telling you,
[2:23:00] we don't have to cast out devils on you.
[2:23:03] You know, brother.
[2:23:06] YES, SIR.
[2:23:07] &gt;&gt; IF YOU GOT A CIGARETTE AND FAITH COME,
[2:23:10] THE CIGARETTE WILL DROP.
[2:23:12] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; You don't get what I'M SAYING?
[2:23:18] WHO PRAYED FOR THE WOMAN AT THE WELL,
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; WHO PRAYED FOR HER?
[2:23:23] &gt;&gt; WHAT DID JESUS DO TO HER?
[2:23:26] &gt;&gt; DISCERN. And when he discern,
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; what did the woman do?
[2:23:33] &gt;&gt; SHE CHANGED AND SHE BEGIN TO GIVE
[2:23:35] TESTIMONY. DID JESUS LAY HAND ON HER?
[2:23:38] &gt;&gt; DID JESUS SAY, "LEAVE YOU BAD SPIRIT?"
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; WHAT DID JESUS DO
[2:23:45] &gt;&gt; WHEN HER FAITH HIT?
[2:23:48] PROSTITUTION SAID
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE FAITH IS THE VICTORY THAT
[2:24:01] OVERCOME WHAT?
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; SO THIS WORLD IF YOU WANT TO OVERCOME
[2:24:06] THIS WORLD
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; ALL THE VICTORY OF EVERYTHING IN THIS
[2:24:10] WORLD is in faith.
[2:24:14] SO IN FAITH THERE IS A VICTORY.
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRHAM SAYS IN FAITH IS A
[2:24:19] VICTORY. HE SAYS FAITH IS WHAT?
[2:24:21] &gt;&gt; THE VICTORY.
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; VICTORY OVER WHAT?
[2:24:24] &gt;&gt; DEATH.
[2:24:24] &gt;&gt; FAITH IS VICTORY OVER WHAT?
[2:24:26] &gt;&gt; SIN.
[2:24:26] &gt;&gt; FAITH IS VICTORY OVER WHAT?
[2:24:28] &gt;&gt; SICKNESS.
[2:24:29] &gt;&gt; FAITH IS VICTORY OVER WHAT?
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; WORRY.
[2:24:31] &gt;&gt; FAITH IS VICTORY OVER WHAT?
[2:24:32] &gt;&gt; FRUSTRATION.
[2:24:33] &gt;&gt; FAITH IS VICTORY OVER WHAT?
[2:24:35] &gt;&gt; THE WORLD. IN OTHER WORDS, GOD GAVE YOU
[2:24:38] THE ESSENTIAL THINGS THAT IS THAT IT ALL
[2:24:41] TERRAIN.
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; HE WILL OVERCOME EVERYTHING.
[2:24:48] &gt;&gt; YOUR HUSBAND IN FAITH,
[2:24:50] &gt;&gt; YOUR FURNITURE IN FAITH, THE WORLD IN
[2:24:52] FAITH, SICKNESS IN FAITH, WAR IN FAITH.
[2:24:56] THERE IS NOTHING THAT IS IN YOUR LIFE
[2:24:59] THAT YOUR FAITH CANNOT OVERCOME.
[2:25:04] AMEN. AMEN. AMEN.
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; You start getting tired.
[2:25:10] &gt;&gt; YOU START GETTING TIRED.
[2:25:11] &gt;&gt; Some of you begin to get full.
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; Stand up and jump and and stretch. Push
[2:25:16] the baby so you can get more.
[2:25:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:25:19] &gt;&gt; Ah, praise the Lord.
[2:25:21] &gt;&gt; Push it so we can get a bed.
[2:25:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:25:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:25:28] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:25:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; LISTEN TO THIS.
[2:25:33] WE KNOW WE KNOW ABOUT the the the armor
[2:25:38] of God.
[2:25:39] &gt;&gt; Put the the the
[2:25:42] &gt;&gt; helmet of salvation. Put this this put
[2:25:45] this put this put there.
[2:25:51] Listen to what he says. LISTEN TO GOD.
[2:25:54] NOW HE SAYS ABOVE ALL
[2:25:59] &gt;&gt; ABOVE EVERYTHING.
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; YES SIR. ABOVE THE HELMET, ABOVE THE THE
[2:26:04] BELT, ABOVE THE BREASTPLATE. IN OTHER
[2:26:07] WORDS, WHAT IS ON TOP OF EVERYTHING
[2:26:11] &gt;&gt; IS WHAT?
[2:26:11] &gt;&gt; THE SHIELD OF FAITH.
[2:26:13] &gt;&gt; THE SHIELD OF WHAT?
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; SO FAITH IS NOT ONLY ME OFFENSE, BUT
[2:26:17] IT'S ALSO DEFENSE.
[2:26:26] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE ATTACKING BY FAITH
[2:26:28] &gt;&gt; AND YOU ARE RESISTING BY FAITH.
[2:26:32] I DON'T KNOW IF WE TOGETHER.
[2:26:37] &gt;&gt; WHY IS THE MASTER only delivering a
[2:26:40] pound and he leave?
[2:26:42] &gt;&gt; Because the pound is victory to
[2:26:45] everything. THE POUND IS DOING
[2:26:47] EVERYTHING. THE POUND IS YOUR SHIELD.
[2:26:51] &gt;&gt; THE POUND IS YOUR FIGHT.
[2:26:53] &gt;&gt; THE POUND CAN BRING EVERYTHING.
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together? HE SAYS, "ABOVE ALL
[2:26:59] THINGS, TAKE OFF WATER,
[2:27:00] &gt;&gt; THE SHIELD OF FAITH,
[2:27:02] &gt;&gt; WHEREWITH YOU SHALL BE ABLE TO WHAT?
[2:27:04] &gt;&gt; TO QUENCH ALL the fiery darts of the
[2:27:06] wicked."
[2:27:07] &gt;&gt; SO IF THE WICKED HAVE A FIERY DART
[2:27:10] &gt;&gt; COMING TO YOU, WHAT do you pull?
[2:27:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:27:16] &gt;&gt; When I'm saying this today, you're
[2:27:18] taking that, but you must put it to
[2:27:20] work.
[2:27:21] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANY
[2:27:23] CRY BABIES. when it's coming. YOU SAY,
[2:27:26] "DEVIL,
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU MY FAITH."
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; GOD TOLD ME, HE GAVE ME FAITH
[2:27:36] &gt;&gt; TO OVERCOME EVERY FIERY D.
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; SO WHATEVER YOU TRY TO INTIMIDATE ME, TO
[2:27:43] DEPRESS ME, TO PUT ME DOWN, TO SHOW ME
[2:27:46] THAT I'M NOBODY, THAT I'M LEFT OVER, I'M
[2:27:49] GOING TO SHOW YOU I WAS BUILT MORE THAN
[2:27:52] THAT.
[2:27:57] I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER.
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER.
[2:27:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:28:00] &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER.
[2:28:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT KEEP YOU HAPPY
[2:28:04] &gt;&gt; IN THE MIDST OF TRIAL.
[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; WHEN TRIAL IS GOING AROUND, THE DEVIL IS
[2:28:10] EXPECTING YOU TO CRY. YOU ARE SMILING.
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; LET THEM GOSSIP ABOUT ME. I AM SMILING.
[2:28:21] &gt;&gt; LET THEM TALK ABOUT ME. I'M SMILING.
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY SAY. I'M SMILING.
[2:28:29] &gt;&gt; THE LORD GIVETH. THE LORD TAKETH AWAY.
[2:28:37] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:28:39] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:28:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:28:41] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; WHAT GOD delivered to the church
[2:28:45] &gt;&gt; is everything.
[2:28:48] &gt;&gt; Everything you need of is in faith.
[2:28:50] Amen.
[2:28:51] &gt;&gt; And not only that,
[2:28:53] &gt;&gt; can you swallow this?
[2:28:54] &gt;&gt; Because I have not gotten to the Holy
[2:28:56] Ghost yet.
[2:28:57] &gt;&gt; Not only that, BUT IT'S THIS BROTHER
[2:28:59] BRANDHAM SAY this word.
[2:29:07] &gt;&gt; Not the WORD THAT YOU OVERCOME, but the
[2:29:10] planet.
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; THIS WORD WAS MADE BY WHAT?
[2:29:14] &gt;&gt; FAITH.
[2:29:17] WHAT GOD delivered to the church and
[2:29:19] left
[2:29:20] &gt;&gt; is the very thing that was creating
[2:29:23] everything.
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; That's hard to swallow.
[2:29:33] &gt;&gt; In other words, what God can give you
[2:29:36] can create. HE GAVE YOU THE VERY THING
[2:29:40] he was using to create
[2:29:42] &gt;&gt; AND HE TOOK IT AND GAVE IT TO YOU AND
[2:29:45] GOD WENT TO HEAVEN AND SAT ON THE THRONE
[2:29:49] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU GOT EVERYTHING.
[2:29:52] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT ME.
[2:30:00] &gt;&gt; You don't understand what I'm saying.
[2:30:04] Glory, glory, glory.
[2:30:06] &gt;&gt; This is for God.
[2:30:08] &gt;&gt; This is for God.
[2:30:10] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:30:11] &gt;&gt; God remove it.
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; If the sword come from the chief, it
[2:30:16] means war, sister.
[2:30:18] &gt;&gt; And God took the unchief sword
[2:30:22] &gt;&gt; and give it to us.
[2:30:24] &gt;&gt; So who's going to fight
[2:30:27] &gt;&gt; in Sabino?
[2:30:30] THE SWORD CAME DOWN
[2:30:33] &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BRANDHAM GRASP IT.
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRHAM SAY IT'S A SWORD OF A
[2:30:37] KING. THEY SAY
[2:30:39] &gt;&gt; IT IS NOT A KING.
[2:30:41] &gt;&gt; IT IS THE KING.
[2:30:42] &gt;&gt; IT IS THE SWORD OF JESUS HANDED BACK TO
[2:30:45] MEN.
[2:30:46] &gt;&gt; SO WHO'S GOING TO FIGHT JESUS?
[2:30:49] &gt;&gt; NO, IT IS THE BRIDE TO TAKE THE SWORD
[2:30:52] AND MOVE ON TO FIGHT.
[2:30:58] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you can understand.
[2:31:03] HOW CAN THE F HOW CAN THE SWORD OF JESUS
[2:31:06] FIT? Brother
[2:31:08] &gt;&gt; it means what?
[2:31:11] &gt;&gt; It means what?
[2:31:13] &gt;&gt; IF I GOT A SHOE I got a shoes
[2:31:15] &gt;&gt; and my boy wake up in the morning and he
[2:31:18] put the shoes and he got on his feet. Do
[2:31:20] you think I WILL TAKE THAT SHOE BACK
[2:31:22] AGAIN?
[2:31:22] &gt;&gt; It belongs to him.
[2:31:29] ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:31:30] &gt;&gt; GOD IS SUPPOSED TO COME AND FIGHT THE
[2:31:32] BATTLE
[2:31:33] &gt;&gt; AND GOD TAKE THE WEAPON THAT HE HAS.
[2:31:39] &gt;&gt; What is HE GIVING YOU?
[2:31:41] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS HE GIVING YOU?
[2:31:43] &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER SAID THIS WORLD HERE WAS
[2:31:46] MADE BY WHAT?
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; I know that's hard for you to swallow
[2:31:51] because of the carnal brain. ARE WE
[2:31:53] TOGETHER? BROTHER SAY THINGS WERE WHAT?
[2:31:56] &gt;&gt; SHAPED IN EXISTENCE
[2:31:57] &gt;&gt; BY WHAT?
[2:31:58] &gt;&gt; FAITH.
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; When they tell you this, you are using
[2:32:05] your reasoning.
[2:32:06] &gt;&gt; And according to your reasoning, so
[2:32:10] I can create a planet. So what am I
[2:32:13] going to do with a planet? Conor mind.
[2:32:17] &gt;&gt; Miss the message. Do you need another
[2:32:20] planet?
[2:32:21] &gt;&gt; According to the plan of redemption, the
[2:32:23] planet is here.
[2:32:24] &gt;&gt; But what is God telling you?
[2:32:26] &gt;&gt; You can create your world.
[2:32:30] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen.
[2:32:31] &gt;&gt; God created the world by the word. Yes,
[2:32:35] sir.
[2:32:36] &gt;&gt; In other words, YOU CAN BEGIN TO SHAPE
[2:32:38] YOUR LIFE.
[2:32:41] &gt;&gt; THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
[2:32:43] &gt;&gt; THE SAME POWER THAT CREATED,
[2:32:46] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN CREATE YOUR LIFE. YOU CAN SAY,
[2:32:49] "LISTEN, FROM 2015,
[2:32:52] &gt;&gt; FROM 2026,
[2:32:54] THIS IS THE MAN I'm going to be.
[2:32:58] &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO BE FREE FROM DEATH.
[2:33:01] &gt;&gt; FREE FROM DEPRESSION.
[2:33:03] YOU GOING TO BEAT THIS
[2:33:14] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE WHAT GOD GAVE YOU IS WHAT
[2:33:18] GOD WAS SHAPING THINGS.
[2:33:26] &gt;&gt; You see this building here? IT WAS
[2:33:28] FRAME. SOMEBODY SAT AND IMAGINE AND PUT
[2:33:32] IT TO work
[2:33:33] &gt;&gt; and then deliver that and the building
[2:33:36] is there.
[2:33:36] &gt;&gt; The same power is in you.
[2:33:41] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN FRAME EVERYTHING AND SAY, YOU
[2:33:43] KNOW WHAT, THIS IS THE man I'm going to
[2:33:44] be.
[2:33:46] &gt;&gt; You're going to be a positive man.
[2:33:48] &gt;&gt; You will never cry again.
[2:33:50] &gt;&gt; You're going to be a man that will be
[2:33:52] looking at this.
[2:33:53] &gt;&gt; And then YOU BEGIN TO CHANGE YOUR
[2:33:55] BEHAVIOR.
[2:33:57] WHEN YOU WAKE UP, YOU SAY, "I'M NOT THE
[2:33:59] MAN I USED TO BE. I'M A DIFFERENT MAN IN
[2:34:02] 2026.
[2:34:03] I'M WALKING IN DIFFERENT GROUND. THIS
[2:34:06] YEAR IS MY YEAR OF DELIVERANCE.
[2:34:10] TOTAL DELIVERANCE. I MUST COME OUT OF
[2:34:13] THIS SITUATION.
[2:34:15] YOU NEED TO FRAME IT BY YOUR WORD USING
[2:34:19] YOUR FAITH.
[2:34:26] I don't KNOW HOW THE DEVIL CAN CONVINCE
[2:34:29] you to be COMFORTABLE IN THE STATE YOU
[2:34:31] ARE.
[2:34:34] &gt;&gt; AND YOU CALL THAT IT'S A TRIAL.
[2:34:37] &gt;&gt; SO TRIAL WAS GIVEN TO BE TRIAL OR TRIAL
[2:34:40] WAS GIVEN FOR GOD TO SHOW UP SO HE CAN
[2:34:43] COME OUT OF IT.
[2:34:46] &gt;&gt; YOUR TRIAL GOD NEVER SHOWED UP.
[2:34:51] WERE YOU BORN WITH THAT TRIAL?
[2:34:55] &gt;&gt; BROTHER SAY THINGS WERE SHAPED INTO
[2:34:58] EXISTENCE BY WHAT?
[2:35:00] &gt;&gt; GOD JUST SEEN THAT DO DROP.
[2:35:03] &gt;&gt; HE SEEN IT HANGING OUT there in the air
[2:35:06] THAT WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT. AND
[2:35:08] HE just did what?
[2:35:09] &gt;&gt; Spake.
[2:35:09] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Let there be."
[2:35:11] &gt;&gt; And there was what?
[2:35:12] &gt;&gt; Light.
[2:35:13] &gt;&gt; And then he brought the lamp forth and
[2:35:15] did what?
[2:35:16] &gt;&gt; And dried it off. And that was all done
[2:35:19] BY AN ACT OF WHAT?
[2:35:21] &gt;&gt; FAITH BY GOD.
[2:35:22] &gt;&gt; THE WHOLE WORD IS MADE BY WHAT?
[2:35:25] &gt;&gt; FAITH.
[2:35:25] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, GOD HIMSELF USE FAITH.
[2:35:30] &gt;&gt; LORD, help help the church.
[2:35:33] &gt;&gt; God himself
[2:35:35] &gt;&gt; use faith
[2:35:36] &gt;&gt; to MAKE THINGS. AND GOD IS TAKING THE
[2:35:39] FAITH HE WAS USING and he's giving to
[2:35:41] you.
[2:35:45] &gt;&gt; Father, help this church. Listen to
[2:35:46] Paul. Listen to Paul. Paul understood
[2:35:50] that.
[2:35:51] &gt;&gt; And you have more than Paul.
[2:35:53] &gt;&gt; But listen to what Paul understood.
[2:35:55] &gt;&gt; Paul says, "I am what?
[2:35:57] &gt;&gt; CRUCIFIED WITH CHRIST.
[2:35:58] &gt;&gt; NEVERTHELESS, I DO WHAT?
[2:36:00] &gt;&gt; I LIVE."
[2:36:01] &gt;&gt; Yet what?
[2:36:02] &gt;&gt; Not I.
[2:36:03] &gt;&gt; But who?
[2:36:03] &gt;&gt; Christ liveth IN ME.
[2:36:05] &gt;&gt; THAT LIVE AND THE LIFE
[2:36:08] &gt;&gt; WHICH NOW NOW I live
[2:36:11] &gt;&gt; where?
[2:36:12] &gt;&gt; IN THE FLESH.
[2:36:13] &gt;&gt; SO PAUL WAS NOT A I MEAN I mean I mean a
[2:36:16] bird flying. He was human being. PAUL IS
[2:36:19] SAYING THE LIFE I'm living in as a human
[2:36:22] being in THE FLESH.
[2:36:24] &gt;&gt; I LIVE IT BY WHAT?
[2:36:25] &gt;&gt; THE FAITH OF THE SON OF GOD.
[2:36:27] &gt;&gt; THE FAITH OF WHO?
[2:36:28] &gt;&gt; THE SON OF GOD.
[2:36:30] &gt;&gt; Read it again.
[2:36:32] &gt;&gt; I'm living that by the faith
[2:36:35] &gt;&gt; of who?
[2:36:36] &gt;&gt; The son of God.
[2:36:37] &gt;&gt; SO THE FAITH BELONGED TO WHO?
[2:36:40] &gt;&gt; THE SON OF GOD.
[2:36:40] &gt;&gt; AND THAT FAITH WAS GIVEN TO WHO?
[2:36:42] &gt;&gt; TO PAUL. SO PAUL IS UTILIZING THE CREDIT
[2:36:46] CARD OF WHO?
[2:36:47] &gt;&gt; SON OF GOD.
[2:36:49] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:36:51] &gt;&gt; PAUL IS TELLING YOU WHATEVER YOU SEE ME
[2:36:53] DOING.
[2:36:54] &gt;&gt; I JUST BORROW A CREDIT CARD AND THE LIFE
[2:36:58] I'M LIVING WITH, IT IS NOT MY FAITH. IT
[2:37:01] IS HIS FAITH THAT HE DELIVERED TO ME AND
[2:37:04] I BEGIN TO USE IT.
[2:37:10] &gt;&gt; FATHER, help your children.
[2:37:15] Hallelujah.
[2:37:17] &gt;&gt; The disciples say increase our faith.
[2:37:19] &gt;&gt; On the day of Pentecost, God say
[2:37:22] because you will begin to say God have a
[2:37:25] different faith. Jesus have a different
[2:37:27] we are devil. The devil never came came
[2:37:30] out and we brought him to Jesus and
[2:37:32] Jesus delivered. So Jesus have a
[2:37:34] different level. Jesus saym I know my
[2:37:35] people. This is the faith I was using.
[2:37:38] Take it.
[2:37:41] SO YOU DON'T SAY MY FAITH ARE DIFFERENT.
[2:37:44] &gt;&gt; NO, NO. I GIVE YOU THE VERY THAT'S WHY I
[2:37:46] DELIVER TO YOU ONCE.
[2:37:52] &gt;&gt; And Paul
[2:37:54] AND PAUL IS SAYING THE LIFE I'M LIVING
[2:37:56] NOW THAT WHATEVER YOU SEE PAUL DOING,
[2:37:59] HEY YOU STOP THERE. BOOM. And the men
[2:38:01] stop. YOU BE BLIND. B IT HAPPENED. PAUL
[2:38:04] IS GOING AND PEOPLE are getting healed.
[2:38:05] He said what you see there is not me. It
[2:38:09] is the fifth
[2:38:12] &gt;&gt; of the son of man.
[2:38:14] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? HE SAYS WHO DID WHAT?
[2:38:17] &gt;&gt; WHO LOVED ME
[2:38:18] &gt;&gt; AND DID WHAT?
[2:38:19] &gt;&gt; AND GAVE HIMSELF.
[2:38:20] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRHAM SAY THIS WAS A WHAT?
[2:38:22] &gt;&gt; A LIVING FAITH.
[2:38:23] &gt;&gt; I LIVE BY THE FAITH OF WHAT?
[2:38:25] &gt;&gt; THE SON OF GOD.
[2:38:26] &gt;&gt; PAUL DID NOT SAY THAT. HE LIVED BY THE
[2:38:29] FAITH IN THE SON OF GOD.
[2:38:34] &gt;&gt; He did not say that.
[2:38:35] &gt;&gt; He did not say that. That's what WE
[2:38:37] USUALLY SAY.
[2:38:39] &gt;&gt; PAUL SAYS HE WAS THE FAITH
[2:38:42] &gt;&gt; OF WHAT?
[2:38:43] &gt;&gt; Son of God.
[2:38:44] &gt;&gt; That had GIVEN HIM WHAT?
[2:38:46] &gt;&gt; LIFE
[2:38:46] &gt;&gt; AND KEEP HIM WHAT?
[2:38:48] &gt;&gt; LIVING IN A Christian victory.
[2:38:53] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:38:55] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:38:57] &gt;&gt; GOD BEFORE HE DEPARTED, he delivered the
[2:39:01] pound.
[2:39:02] &gt;&gt; He delivered the faith AND THAT FAITH IS
[2:39:05] EVERYTHING.
[2:39:06] HE KNEW THAT WHATEVER you have in the
[2:39:08] pan will take care of everything until
[2:39:11] he return.
[2:39:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:39:16] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, WHATEVER YOU HAVE NEED
[2:39:17] OF IS IN THAT FAITH.
[2:39:19] &gt;&gt; UNTIL I COME BACK.
[2:39:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND PAUL IS SAYING THE LIFE I'M
[2:39:23] LEAVING ME, PAUL, I'm not living that by
[2:39:26] myself.
[2:39:27] &gt;&gt; Somebody gave me the faith.
[2:39:29] &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE OF UTILIZING HIS FAITH, I'm
[2:39:32] having doors open.
[2:39:33] &gt;&gt; Your faith didn't decline.
[2:39:36] your card decline.
[2:39:38] &gt;&gt; But when you pull his American Express
[2:39:43] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU SWAP IT,
[2:39:45] &gt;&gt; ALL YOU HEAR IS CH
[2:39:48] and the RECEIPT BEGIN TO COME.
[2:39:50] &gt;&gt; IT'S ALWAYS APPROVAL.
[2:39:56] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:39:57] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:39:58] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:40:00] &gt;&gt; CAN YOU GIVE ME 15 MINUTES?
[2:40:02] &gt;&gt; Can you give me 15 minutes?
[2:40:04] Yes.
[2:40:05] &gt;&gt; Can you give me 15 minutes?

[2:40:19] &gt;&gt; But you know what I'm saying?
[2:40:21] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:40:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:40:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:40:25] &gt;&gt; In our equation, we got the body,
[2:40:28] &gt;&gt; we got the spirit,
[2:40:30] &gt;&gt; and we got the baptism. But we have left
[2:40:33] uh faith.
[2:40:34] &gt;&gt; What is faith in this equation?
[2:40:37] &gt;&gt; Put your seat belt. I'm going to launch
[2:40:39] and we drop.

[2:40:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:55] &gt;&gt; Brother described faith like this.

[2:41:29] brotherham is calling that money.
[2:41:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:41:34] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, "ALL RIGHT, DO WHAT?
[2:41:36] &gt;&gt; Take it out."
[2:41:37] &gt;&gt; IT'S A POWER THAT DOES WHAT?
[2:41:39] &gt;&gt; BUYS.
[2:41:39] &gt;&gt; WHATSOEVER that believe when you pray,
[2:41:42] believe you receive it. Uh you believe
[2:41:44] you receive what you ask for. If you
[2:41:46] desire, pray and believe, you get it,
[2:41:48] you shall do what?
[2:41:49] &gt;&gt; Have it. By this we found out that
[2:41:52] brother Bran describing here that faith
[2:41:54] is the word the scripture that is coming
[2:41:57] to you
[2:41:58] &gt;&gt; in the time of a specific need
[2:42:02] &gt;&gt; and THE SCRIPTURE WILL DROP TO YOU
[2:42:04] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS YOU'RE GOING THROUGH A
[2:42:06] PROBLEM
[2:42:07] &gt;&gt; AND AS YOU'RE GOING THROUGH A problem
[2:42:09] and you are thinking what can I do what
[2:42:12] can I DO WHAT CAN AND SUDDENLY
[2:42:15] &gt;&gt; IT LOOKS LIKE A SCRIPTURE IS WINDING
[2:42:18] FROM SOMEWHERE SIR
[2:42:22] AND YOU LOOK AROUND, NOBODY'S THERE WITH
[2:42:24] YOU.
[2:42:25] &gt;&gt; BUT SOMETHING WHISPER A SPIRIT.
[2:42:27] &gt;&gt; I MEAN A SCRIPTURE.
[2:42:29] &gt;&gt; THAT SCRIPTURE IS SOMEBODY WHO HAVE
[2:42:32] DELIVERED SOMETHING TO YOU.
[2:42:34] &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER IS CALLING THAT FAITH.
[2:42:38] &gt;&gt; A SCRIPTURE THAT IS DELIVERED
[2:42:41] &gt;&gt; IN THE TIME OF NEED. AND THAT SCRIPTURE
[2:42:44] MATCHES YOUR PROBLEM.
[2:42:49] CHURCH, are we together?
[2:42:51] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:42:52] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:42:54] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS THIS, MY FRIEND.
[2:42:56] HE SAY, "WHAT IS A WHAT?"
[2:42:59] &gt;&gt; What is what
[2:43:00] &gt;&gt; faith
[2:43:01] &gt;&gt; IS GOD?
[2:43:03] &gt;&gt; BY the spirit doing what?
[2:43:05] &gt;&gt; REVEALING TO YOU
[2:43:07] &gt;&gt; SOMETHING THAT HE'S GOING TO DO
[2:43:10] &gt;&gt; OR HIS PROMISE.
[2:43:14] SO WHAT YOU CALL A THOUGHT, IT'S NOT
[2:43:17] REALLY A THOUGHT
[2:43:20] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOUR MIND RECEIVE DIFFERENT
[2:43:22] THOUGHTS.
[2:43:24] &gt;&gt; I MAN RECEIVE A THOUGHT FROM HELL.
[2:43:27] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[2:43:29] &gt;&gt; AND THE THOUGHT FROM HELL SAY BASED ON
[2:43:31] YOUR PROBLEM COMMIT SUICIDE.
[2:43:35] &gt;&gt; KILL YOURSELF.
[2:43:37] &gt;&gt; BUT THAT THAT MIND OF YOU IS AN
[2:43:40] &gt;&gt; AIRPORT.
[2:43:41] YOU WILL ALSO RECEIVE THOUGHT FROM
[2:43:44] HEAVEN
[2:43:45] &gt;&gt; AND YOU WILL HEAR ANOTHER ONE COMING
[2:43:48] &gt;&gt; AND SAY DON'T DO IT.
[2:43:50] &gt;&gt; I AM THE PRESENT HELP IN THE TIME OF
[2:43:53] TROUBLE. I WILL TAKE YOU OUT OF THIS.
[2:44:01] &gt;&gt; I hope we ARE TOGETHER AND BROTHER SAID
[2:44:04] THAT IS FAITH.
[2:44:10] Brother Brham say now IF YOU ONLY HEAR
[2:44:13] FAITH COMETH BY WHAT?
[2:44:15] &gt;&gt; By hearing.
[2:44:16] &gt;&gt; But hearing is not faith.
[2:44:28] Can I continue?
[2:44:30] &gt;&gt; Faith cometh by what? Hearing
[2:44:33] &gt;&gt; but everything you hear is not faith.
[2:44:38] &gt;&gt; Faith is distant.
[2:44:41] &gt;&gt; You will hear that this this is this is
[2:44:47] &gt;&gt; someone can talk to you 10 things
[2:44:49] &gt;&gt; but out of 10 you will see one is
[2:44:52] tracking.
[2:44:54] &gt;&gt; That was the message. Everything else
[2:44:56] was only a preparation.
[2:45:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:06] &gt;&gt; God bless you, sister. How are you? I'm

[2:45:38] YOU ASK THE SISTER WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER?
[2:45:43] &gt;&gt; SHE WON'T REMEMBER BUT THE OTHER
[2:45:45] CONVERSATION. MOM HE TOLD ME HE LOVED
[2:45:48] ME. THAT'S ALL. THAT WAS THE MESSAGE.

[2:46:32] &gt;&gt; They need to know how to fight.
[2:46:34] &gt;&gt; THEY NEED TO BE SENSITIVE TO THE SHIFT.
[2:46:37] &gt;&gt; BRAND SAY WHEN YOU TALK TO SOMEBODY,
[2:46:39] TALK TO HIM ABOUT HIS BUSINESS UNTIL YOU
[2:46:41] FEEL
[2:46:43] &gt;&gt; THAT THIS IS TIME TO DELIVER. YOU GOT TO
[2:46:45] BE LOOKING AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS THE
[2:46:48] TIME TO DELIVER THE TOMAHAWK.

[2:48:23] &gt;&gt; OH MY GOD. HE SAYS, "BUT HEARING IS
[2:48:26] WHAT?"
[2:48:26] &gt;&gt; NOT FAITH.

[2:48:29] &gt;&gt; Purchased for 25 cents.
[2:48:31] &gt;&gt; But 25 cents is not the loaf of bread.

[2:48:55] &gt;&gt; THE SUBSTANCE of things hoped for
[2:48:56] &gt;&gt; the
[2:48:57] &gt;&gt; evidence of things not seen."
[2:48:58] &gt;&gt; Then you see, you hear what?
[2:49:00] &gt;&gt; THE WORD.

[2:49:41] ticket.

[2:49:44] &gt;&gt; to enter the airplane,
[2:49:46] &gt;&gt; they won't collect money.
[2:49:50] &gt;&gt; Even if you come with money,
[2:49:52] &gt;&gt; you say the ticket is $400.
[2:49:55] &gt;&gt; This is uh $400. No one will put you in
[2:49:58] the airplane.
[2:49:59] &gt;&gt; They want to see the ticket.
[2:50:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU MUST FIRST PURCHASE
[2:50:06] &gt;&gt; THE ticket
[2:50:08] &gt;&gt; and MONEY BECOME THE TICKET.

[2:50:35] &gt;&gt; IT IS NOT THE MONEY.

[2:52:16] &gt;&gt; A QUARTER
[2:52:16] &gt;&gt; AND I HAD WATER.
[2:52:17] &gt;&gt; THE QUARTER.
[2:52:18] &gt;&gt; THE QUARTER IS NOT the loaf OF BREAD.
[2:52:21] &gt;&gt; THE QUARTER IS WHAT?
[2:52:22] &gt;&gt; The purchasing power of the loaf of
[2:52:24] bread.
[2:52:24] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "OH, I BELIEVE WHAT
[2:52:26] &gt;&gt; THE WORD
[2:52:27] &gt;&gt; THAT IS FINE." BUT IT IS THROUGH FAITH
[2:52:31] &gt;&gt; THAT PURCHASES
[2:52:33] &gt;&gt; THE HOLY SPIRIT.
[2:52:39] &gt;&gt; I know it's a ballistic missile. It's
[2:52:41] ringing.
[2:52:43] &gt;&gt; And oh, it's not me.
[2:52:46] &gt;&gt; It's not me.
[2:52:47] &gt;&gt; Let me read it again. Brother Robert,
[2:52:49] I'm heading to the airport, MY FRIEND.
[2:52:51] BROTHER BRHAM SAY, "BUT IT IS WHAT?"
[2:52:53] &gt;&gt; THROUGH FAITH.
[2:52:54] &gt;&gt; You tired, my friend?

[2:53:03] &gt;&gt; PURCHASES the Holy Spirit.
[2:53:06] &gt;&gt; I know your problem. It's like uh we are
[2:53:09] buying the Holy Ghost with money. No,
[2:53:11] you are buying the Holy Ghost with the
[2:53:13] money of God.
[2:53:18] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is bought with the money
[2:53:20] of God.
[2:53:24] &gt;&gt; And I can even shock you. I can even
[2:53:27] shock you if you want to.
[2:53:29] &gt;&gt; I can even shock you if you want to.

[2:53:38] &gt;&gt; Which offering did she give?
[2:53:41] &gt;&gt; She gave how many how much money?
[2:53:43] &gt;&gt; $20.
[2:53:43] &gt;&gt; She was a widow woman with two children.
[2:53:46] &gt;&gt; And the two children was the same sex.
[2:53:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.

[2:53:52] $20, which was money naturally, what did
[2:53:55] what what happened to her children?
[2:54:00] &gt;&gt; It produced what?
[2:54:06] &gt;&gt; You have a problem with me.
[2:54:08] &gt;&gt; WHEN SHE GAVE $20 NATURALLY, THE $20
[2:54:12] GAVE THE CHILDREN WHAT?
[2:54:16] &gt;&gt; You afraid to say

[2:54:32] THE PROPHET SAY HEALING
[2:54:35] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU GAVE $20. BROTHER BRHAM SAY

[2:54:40] MONEY. GOD SAID, "NO,
[2:54:43] &gt;&gt; LEAVE THE $20
[2:54:45] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF THE $20
[2:54:48] &gt;&gt; because of money.

[2:54:52] &gt;&gt; GOD FLIPS
[2:54:53] &gt;&gt; AND GOD SAY healing

[2:55:09] GOD TOOK THE HOLY GHOST UPON $20 AND

[2:55:23] &gt;&gt; I hope WE ARE TOGETHER.

[2:55:51] &gt;&gt; IT TAKES THE SPIRITUAL MONEY
[2:55:55] &gt;&gt; CALLED FAITH
[2:55:56] &gt;&gt; TO PURCHASE THE HOLY GHOST.
[2:55:59] &gt;&gt; IF YOU NEED THE HOLY GHOST, YOU JUST
[2:56:02] NEED FAITH.
[2:56:03] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY HE TOLD THE DISCIPLE, BUT YOU
[2:56:06] SHALL RECEIVE POWER.
[2:56:10] I ALREADY GAVE YOU THE FAITH.
[2:56:12] &gt;&gt; JUST GO WAIT

[2:56:24] THE KINGDOM? Don't worry about it. You
[2:56:26] already received the faith. Go wait in
[2:56:29] Jerusalem
[2:56:31] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE FAITH I GAVE YOU IS GOING TO
[2:56:33] BUY YOU THE Holy Ghost.
[2:56:40] AND WHAT DID THE DISCIPLE DO? THEY WENT
[2:56:42] AND SIT down and begin to pray and
[2:56:44] praising the Lord.
[2:56:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:56:47] &gt;&gt; One day, two days, three day when he hit
[2:56:50] 10,
[2:56:51] &gt;&gt; according to the 10,
[2:56:58] &gt;&gt; THE FAITH OF A 10 POUND PULLED THE HOLY
[2:57:01] GHOST FROM HEAVEN.
[2:57:06] FATHER, help your children, brother.
[2:57:11] &gt;&gt; I'm feeling a resistance, so I'm trying
[2:57:14] to push.
[2:57:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:57:16] &gt;&gt; Let's change gear, my friend.
[2:57:19] &gt;&gt; Okay, we ready?

[2:57:24] &gt;&gt; FAITH.
[2:57:24] &gt;&gt; THAT PURCHASE WHAT?
[2:57:26] &gt;&gt; THE HOLY SPIRIT.
[2:57:27] &gt;&gt; SEE WHAT?
[2:57:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:57:29] &gt;&gt; SO, WHAT PURCHASED THE HOLY GHOST?
[2:57:31] &gt;&gt; FAITH.
[2:57:31] &gt;&gt; What did God leave the church? Faith.
[2:57:34] &gt;&gt; Faith give you a job.
[2:57:38] &gt;&gt; Faith give you the husband you want.
[2:57:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:57:42] &gt;&gt; He give you the wife you should.
[2:57:44] &gt;&gt; He give you a NEW FURNITURE.
[2:57:46] &gt;&gt; HE CREATE a world for you.
[2:57:48] &gt;&gt; He make you live a Christian life.
[2:57:50] &gt;&gt; IT IS YOUR VICTORY. HE OVERCOMETH THE
[2:57:54] WORLD. HE ALSO PURCHASE THE HOLY GHOST.
[2:58:02] WHEN I say purchase the Holy Ghost, you
[2:58:04] got a problem.
[2:58:05] &gt;&gt; Let's read Paul
[2:58:08] &gt;&gt; in the book of Galatian. What?
[2:58:10] &gt;&gt; Three
[2:58:10] &gt;&gt; verse what?
[2:58:11] &gt;&gt; Two two to two and five.
[2:58:12] &gt;&gt; The Bible say this only with I learn of
[2:58:15] you.
[2:58:17] &gt;&gt; This is Paul.
[2:58:18] &gt;&gt; Receive ye what?
[2:58:20] &gt;&gt; The spirit
[2:58:21] &gt;&gt; BY THE WORKS OF the law
[2:58:25] &gt;&gt; or by what? the hearing of faith.
[2:58:28] &gt;&gt; So the Holy Ghost come how?
[2:58:30] &gt;&gt; By the hearing of faith.
[2:58:31] &gt;&gt; By the what?
[2:58:32] &gt;&gt; Hearing of faith.
[2:58:33] &gt;&gt; So you got to have a hearing
[2:58:37] &gt;&gt; of faith
[2:58:38] &gt;&gt; because it's the reading of faith. The
[2:58:40] hearing of faith
[2:58:42] &gt;&gt; that purchase the Holy Ghost.
[2:58:48] &gt;&gt; MY WORD ARE SPIRIT
[2:58:50] &gt;&gt; and they are truthful.
[2:58:52] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN MY WORD IS BEEN PREACHED, THE
[2:58:56] HEARING THAT YOU'RE HEARING
[2:58:58] &gt;&gt; of faith of revelation is WHAT BRING THE
[2:59:02] HOLY GHOST TO YOU.
[2:59:10] &gt;&gt; Let me read it again. It's hard.
[2:59:12] &gt;&gt; It's hard my friend
[2:59:14] &gt;&gt; because you got Holy Ghost by laying on
[2:59:16] hand. But I'm not talking about laying
[2:59:19] on hand
[2:59:22] &gt;&gt; because if I do something wrong, you
[2:59:24] will you will you will begin to think,
[2:59:26] okay, if that pastor who lay hand on me
[2:59:29] has uh backsliding, so what kind of Holy
[2:59:32] Spirit did I get from you?
[2:59:34] &gt;&gt; No, no. I'm I'm away from that.
[2:59:36] &gt;&gt; Me, I'm sitting here. I want God to lay
[2:59:39] hand on you himself.
[2:59:45] Amen.
[2:59:46] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:59:47] &gt;&gt; are we together?
[2:59:48] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:59:49] &gt;&gt; So, you don't DEPEND ON A MAN.
[2:59:51] &gt;&gt; NO, SIR.
[2:59:51] &gt;&gt; You have TO HAVE YOUR OWN ABSOLUTE.
[2:59:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND PAUL IS SAYING THE HOLY GHOST,
[2:59:57] YOU RECEIVE IT BY THE HEARING OF IT.
[3:00:01] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORD, WHEN YOU ARE SITTING ON
[3:00:02] THE SERMON AND THE SERMON WAS GOING,
[3:00:06] SOMETHING WAS COMING TO YOU
[3:00:09] &gt;&gt; AND IT HIT YOU.
[3:00:11] AND WHEN IT HIT YOU,
[3:00:13] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY,
[3:00:15] &gt;&gt; "OH, MAN.
[3:00:17] &gt;&gt; I see it."
[3:00:19] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU SEE IT,
[3:00:30] &gt;&gt; the woman at the just so
[3:00:34] &gt;&gt; I perceive.
[3:00:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:00:37] &gt;&gt; You are.
[3:00:38] &gt;&gt; You are a prophet. AMEN.
[3:00:40] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE PROPHET OPEN UP,
[3:00:45] &gt;&gt; she drop everything.
[3:00:50] &gt;&gt; On fire.
[3:00:51] &gt;&gt; ON FIRE.
[3:00:52] &gt;&gt; ON FIRE.
[3:00:53] &gt;&gt; SHE FORGET WHO SHE WAS.
[3:00:55] &gt;&gt; SHE FORGOT SHE WAS A PROSTITUTE.
[3:00:57] &gt;&gt; She begin to go all over. Come and see.
[3:00:59] &gt;&gt; And she collected people.
[3:01:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:01:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:01:04] &gt;&gt; Paul said, "RECEIVE YE THE HOLY GHOST BY
[3:01:07] WHAT?"
[3:01:08] &gt;&gt; By the works of THE LORD. OH, BY WHAT?
[3:01:10] &gt;&gt; The hearing of faith.
[3:01:12] &gt;&gt; THE THEREFORE THAT MINISTER TO YOU the
[3:01:15] spirit.
[3:01:16] &gt;&gt; In other words, the one that give you
[3:01:17] the Holy Ghost
[3:01:18] &gt;&gt; and work
[3:01:20] &gt;&gt; miracles AMONG
[3:01:20] &gt;&gt; THE ONE THAT does miracle among you and
[3:01:23] that give you the Holy Ghost.
[3:01:25] &gt;&gt; DOES HE DOES HE BY the works of THE LAW
[3:01:28] OR BY THE WHAT?
[3:01:29] &gt;&gt; The hearing OF FAITH.
[3:01:30] &gt;&gt; SO MIRACLE SHOULD HAPPEN HOW?
[3:01:35] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost should happen how? by
[3:01:38] the hearing OF FAITH. SO THAT'S WHAT
[3:01:40] BROTHER WAS TRYING TO BRING THE CHURCH
[3:01:42] TO
[3:01:44] &gt;&gt; TO THE HIGH LEVEL OF THE WORD
[3:01:47] &gt;&gt; THAT WHEN THE WORD IS COMING

[3:03:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[3:03:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHAT IS THE CAUSE of this
[3:03:14] misunderstanding?
[3:03:17] &gt;&gt; Because some say experience.
[3:03:20] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[3:03:21] &gt;&gt; And we go through experience, we don't
[3:03:22] get it.
[3:03:26] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[3:03:27] &gt;&gt; how many how many testimony have I hear
[3:03:30] from young people?
[3:03:31] &gt;&gt; We went to the meeting over there. It
[3:03:33] was powerful. Yeah,
[3:03:34] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you the Lord came down.
[3:03:36] &gt;&gt; I was on the floor
[3:03:38] &gt;&gt; 3 month
[3:03:43] &gt;&gt; back up again to the same struggle. Oh,
[3:03:45] I thought you told me when you were in
[3:03:48] Minnesota, Louisiana or whatever camp
[3:03:51] that you went to, the Lord the day the
[3:03:52] Lord came down.
[3:03:54] &gt;&gt; HUH?
[3:03:56] &gt;&gt; HUH? SOME OF YOU WERE at the altar
[3:04:00] and when you come there you say now this
[3:04:02] thing is really tomorrow.
[3:04:07] &gt;&gt; Where is all the zeal? One week all the
[3:04:09] zeal all the fire is gone.
[3:04:15] &gt;&gt; SO NOW YOU'RE WAITING FOR THE NEXT CAMP.
[3:04:19] &gt;&gt; How many camps will you go to? Amen.
[3:04:24] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY TIMES WILL IT TESTIFY
[3:04:26] &gt;&gt; that you got the HOLY GHOST?
[3:04:29] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY TIME WILL YOU TESTIFY THAT
[3:04:31] SOMETHING HAPPENED TO ME? YOU SAY THAT
[3:04:33] 10 TIME YOU KEEP COMING back
[3:04:38] &gt;&gt; because we miss what the Holy Ghost is.
[3:04:41] We went with a Pentecostal understanding
[3:04:45] &gt;&gt; and we left the main thing
[3:04:47] &gt;&gt; and we begin to go from ONE CAMP TO
[3:04:48] ANOTHER FROM ONE CAMP TO ANOTHER. For
[3:04:51] what what we are looking for is a
[3:04:53] sensation
[3:04:57] &gt;&gt; AND WE CALL THAT EXPERIENCE.
[3:05:00] &gt;&gt; EXPERIENCE MAY PRODUCE SENSATION
[3:05:03] &gt;&gt; BUT NOT ALL SENSATIONAL EXPERIENCE.
[3:05:09] &gt;&gt; You can go home my friend.

[3:05:19] MISUNDERSTANDING THE ANSWER IS WHAT?
[3:05:22] &gt;&gt; EXPERIENCE.
[3:05:23] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE GONE BY WHAT?
[3:05:25] &gt;&gt; EXPERIENCE.
[3:05:26] &gt;&gt; AND NOT BY THE WORD.
[3:05:27] &gt;&gt; THE WORD. AMEN.

[3:06:41] &gt;&gt; FATHER HELP US. HALLELUJAH. THERE IS
[3:06:43] ALWAYS DIFFICULT IN THE WAY. SATAN DOES
[3:06:46] WHAT?
[3:06:47] &gt;&gt; THROWS everything in the way he can.

[3:07:01] LOT OF HINDRANCE.
[3:07:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[3:07:03] &gt;&gt; BUT HER FAITH DIDN'T HAVE ANY.
[3:07:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[3:07:06] &gt;&gt; FAITH HAS WHAT?
[3:07:07] &gt;&gt; NO HINDRANCE.
[3:07:08] &gt;&gt; THERE IS NOTHING GOING TO STOP IT.
[3:07:11] &gt;&gt; NO MATTER WHAT ANYBODY SAY, IF YOU GOT
[3:07:13] THE RIGHT HOLD ON WHAT?
[3:07:15] &gt;&gt; GOD.
[3:07:15] &gt;&gt; GOD HAVE A RIGHT GOD.

[3:07:30] &gt;&gt; STANDING HERE TELLING YOU YOU WAS DYING
[3:07:33] AND YOU WOULD NOT believe one word of it
[3:07:39] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE FAITH CAUGHT GOD AND GOD CAUGHT
[3:07:42] FAITH.
[3:07:46] &gt;&gt; IT IS IN THE DIFFERENT LEVEL THAT THE
[3:07:49] DEVIL CANNOT REACH.
[3:07:56] HALLELUJAH.
[3:07:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says this, "If you believe
[3:07:59] in the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[3:08:02] &gt;&gt; and the Holy Spirit get a hold OF YOU,
[3:08:05] &gt;&gt; HE SHALL BAPTIZE YOU.
[3:08:13] &gt;&gt; Let's finish this and you go home."
[3:08:15] Brother say if you believe in the water
[3:08:18] &gt;&gt; baptism of the Holy Spirit
[3:08:20] &gt;&gt; and the Holy Spirit get a hold of you
[3:08:23] &gt;&gt; AND HE SHALL BAPTIZE YOU
[3:08:25] &gt;&gt; and you get a hold of him you won't have
[3:08:29] to move from your seat
[3:08:41] &gt;&gt; let's stop here my friend some of you
[3:08:44] are tired
[3:08:45] Because this material is not game.
[3:08:47] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[3:08:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:08:48] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[3:08:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:08:49] &gt;&gt; Brother say if you get a hold of the
[3:08:52] spirit of the lord
[3:08:53] &gt;&gt; and the spirit of the lord got a hold on
[3:08:55] you don't have to move from your seat.
[3:08:58] Amen.
[3:08:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:09:03] &gt;&gt; So if you don't move from the spirit
[3:09:05] from your seat, what is how is the Holy
[3:09:07] Ghost coming to you?
[3:09:11] &gt;&gt; BROTHER SAID YOU DON'T HAVE TO MOVE. You
[3:09:14] won't have to move from your seat.
[3:09:17] &gt;&gt; He God will do what?
[3:09:20] &gt;&gt; Fill you
[3:09:20] &gt;&gt; with water.
[3:09:21] &gt;&gt; HIS PRESENCE
[3:09:22] &gt;&gt; RIGHT THERE WHERE YOU ARE.
[3:09:28] JUST AS HE DID,
[3:09:30] &gt;&gt; HE DID WHAT?
[3:09:33] &gt;&gt; YES.
[3:09:34] &gt;&gt; These words,
[3:09:35] &gt;&gt; THE HOLY GHOST DID WHAT?
[3:09:36] &gt;&gt; Fell on them that HEARD IT.
[3:09:38] &gt;&gt; THEM THAT DID WHAT?
[3:09:39] &gt;&gt; HEARD IT.
[3:09:40] &gt;&gt; THEM THAT DID WHAT?
[3:09:41] &gt;&gt; THAT HEARD IT.
[3:09:42] &gt;&gt; THAT DID WHAT?
[3:09:42] &gt;&gt; THAT HEARD IT.
[3:09:43] &gt;&gt; FAITH COMETH BY WHAT?
[3:09:44] &gt;&gt; BY HEARING.
[3:09:45] &gt;&gt; SO AS YOU HEARING THE WORD,
[3:09:48] &gt;&gt; THE HOLY GHOST ALSO COME. AND WHEN THE
[3:09:51] HOLY GHOST COME, YOU DON'T NEED ME. THE
[3:09:54] WORD IS COMING WITH THE SPIRIT.
[3:09:57] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN HE HIT YOU, SOMETHING BURN IN
[3:10:00] YOU AND SAY THAT'S NOTHING BUT THE
[3:10:04] TRUTH. THAT IS GOD RIGHT THERE.

[3:10:21] &gt;&gt; SO MY MINISTRY HAS NEVER BEEN VERY
[3:10:24] EFFECTIVE WHERE
[3:10:25] &gt;&gt; IN THE UNITED STATES
[3:10:26] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT THE PEOPLE HAS BEEN TRA
[3:10:30] &gt;&gt; THE OLD
[3:10:31] &gt;&gt; THE OLD WATER
[3:10:33] &gt;&gt; JEWISH TRADITION
[3:10:34] &gt;&gt; OF DOING WHAT?
[3:10:35] &gt;&gt; LAYING HANDS ON THE SICK
[3:10:36] &gt;&gt; THAT NEVER WAS TO THE GENTILE.
[3:10:42] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[3:10:45] I didn't write the code.
[3:10:48] &gt;&gt; I'm just responsible to read.
[3:10:50] &gt;&gt; The ministry of brother brother.
[3:10:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:10:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:10:55] &gt;&gt; In my hurt
[3:10:58] &gt;&gt; because our folks love prayer line.
[3:11:03] &gt;&gt; Our folks in the United States
[3:11:06] &gt;&gt; special PhD on prayer line
[3:11:08] &gt;&gt; and the young people are waiting for the
[3:11:10] end of the service.
[3:11:11] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Come on. Yes sir.
[3:11:12] &gt;&gt; So when they preaching
[3:11:14] &gt;&gt; they are just there.
[3:11:15] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[3:11:16] &gt;&gt; They're waiting for the end of the
[3:11:17] service. Then everybody on a prayer
[3:11:19] line.
[3:11:20] &gt;&gt; Everybody on a prayer line.
[3:11:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:11:21] &gt;&gt; Everybody on a prayer. So the prayer
[3:11:23] line will start from here all the way to
[3:11:25] the street over there.
[3:11:31] &gt;&gt; And we line up preachers.
[3:11:36] And when you cross the line, this hand
[3:11:38] here, this hand here, this hand here,
[3:11:40] this hand, and you come up from there.
[3:11:43] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT MAKING FUN. I'M TELLING FACT.
[3:11:47] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRHAM WAS FORCED TO DO THAT.
[3:11:50] &gt;&gt; BUT THAT WAS NOT GOD'S WILL.
[3:11:57] BROTHER BRANAM SAY MY MINISTRY THE
[3:11:59] MESSAGE OF BROTHER BRHAM THE MINISTRY OF
[3:12:02] BROTHER BRHAM HAS NEVER BEEN HOW
[3:12:05] &gt;&gt; VERY EFFECTIVE IN THE UNITED STATES
[3:12:08] &gt;&gt; WHY BECAUSE THAT THE PEOPLE HAS BEEN
[3:12:11] WHAT
[3:12:11] &gt;&gt; TRAINED
[3:12:12] &gt;&gt; IF WE CONTINUE TO DO THAT HOW IS THE
[3:12:15] MESSAGE GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE
[3:12:22] &gt;&gt; spoken word
[3:12:24] Brother Brham said his ministry in
[3:12:27] America has never been affected. Why?
[3:12:30] Because of laying on hand. And we
[3:12:32] preacher continue to lay your hand.
[3:12:36] &gt;&gt; SO WHAT ARE WE DOING?
[3:12:38] &gt;&gt; WE ARE BLOCKING THE EFFECTIVENESS
[3:12:41] OF BROTHER BRANA MINISTRY.
[3:12:48] &gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT THE FIRST POOL.
[3:12:50] &gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT THE SECOND POOL.
[3:12:53] THIS IS NO CONTACT.
[3:12:56] &gt;&gt; NO CONTACT.
[3:12:57] &gt;&gt; IT'S A WORD CONTACT.
[3:13:00] &gt;&gt; YOU CONTACTING THE WORD
[3:13:03] &gt;&gt; AND YOU AND THE WORD MEETING TOGETHER.
[3:13:10] &gt;&gt; I don't KNOW IF WE TOGETHER. SO WHEN YOU
[3:13:13] LEAVE THE SERVICE, YOU SAY, "BROTHER
[3:13:15] STEPHEN, THAT WAS NOT YOU."
[3:13:17] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHAT YOU WERE PREACHING, YOU
[3:13:19] DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I was going through.
[3:13:21] THIS IS GOD.
[3:13:22] &gt;&gt; I KNOW IT'S NOT YOU. ME AND YOU DIDN'T
[3:13:25] SEE EACH OTHER, BUT WHAT YOU WERE
[3:13:27] PREACHING WAS NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH.
[3:13:30] THAT IS THE CONTACT BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR
[3:13:33] GOD.
[3:13:37] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. I hope WE ARE
[3:13:40] TOGETHER. HE SAYS BECAUSE OF BECAUSE THE
[3:13:43] PEOPLE HAS BEEN TRAINED of water,
[3:13:44] &gt;&gt; the old Jewish water of doing what? and
[3:13:47] laying hands on THE SICK
[3:13:48] &gt;&gt; THAT NEVER
[3:13:50] &gt;&gt; never
[3:13:51] &gt;&gt; Can you read so we finish?
[3:13:53] &gt;&gt; That you the ONE HOLDING ME HERE.
[3:13:55] &gt;&gt; THAT NEVER WAS WHAT
[3:13:57] &gt;&gt; TO THE GENTILES.
[3:13:58] &gt;&gt; AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE TAUGHT THAT
[3:14:02] &gt;&gt; DOING WHAT?
[3:14:03] &gt;&gt; LAY HANDS on the sick.
[3:14:05] &gt;&gt; How many years

[3:14:22] &gt;&gt; when are we going to be win
[3:14:26] &gt;&gt; FROM THAT BREASTFEEDING?
[3:14:32] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SOME OF THE PREACHER THAT LAY
[3:14:34] HAND ON US, THEY LEFT THE MESSAGE.
[3:14:40] &gt;&gt; SO, DID WE RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST OR
[3:14:42] NOT?

[3:21:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:21:10] &gt;&gt; And they come up, they say, "He was
[3:21:11] good.
[3:21:12] &gt;&gt; That was a good speaker today.
[3:21:16] &gt;&gt; We don't come to church for
[3:21:17] entertainment."
[3:21:19] &gt;&gt; We don't play music for entertainment.
[3:21:21] &gt;&gt; When the music is going,
[3:21:23] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham said, "That's another
[3:21:25] way to preach the gospel."
[3:21:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:21:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[3:21:32] &gt;&gt; In other words, LORD, LET ME GET

[3:21:51] GET TODAY? WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN RESERVE
[3:21:53] FOR ME TODAY? WHAT DID YOU KEEP FOR ME?
[3:21:56] GIVE IT TO ME SO I GO HOME.
[3:22:02] YES SIR.
[3:22:02] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID WHEN YOU RECEIVE
[3:22:04] IT FROM WHERE YOU ARE,
[3:22:06] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T NEED TO SCRAMBLE for prayer.
[3:22:10] &gt;&gt; You don't need to SCRAMBLE FOR PRAYER
[3:22:12] LINE.
[3:22:13] &gt;&gt; YOU JUST GOING DOWN THE STREET DOING
[3:22:15] WHAT?
[3:22:16] &gt;&gt; It is what?
[3:22:17] &gt;&gt; SETTLED.
[3:22:17] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE EVIDENCE OF THINGS YOU DO NOT
[3:22:20] HAVE.
[3:22:20] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU HAVE WHAT?
[3:22:22] &gt;&gt; The purchase power.
[3:22:23] &gt;&gt; You got faith.
[3:22:27] SOMETHING THAT IS TELLING YOU,
[3:22:29] &gt;&gt; you didn't come to this church by
[3:22:31] accident.
[3:22:32] &gt;&gt; SOMETHING THAT IS TELLING YOU, GOD, if
[3:22:35] you allow me to listen to this sermon
[3:22:37] today, you know my need.
[3:22:40] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm going through AND YOU
[3:22:43] ARE REVEALING TO ME TODAY that you gave
[3:22:45] me faith. AND THE FAITH YOU GAVE ME IS
[3:22:49] EVERYTHING. IT IS THE VICTORY FOR MY
[3:22:51] CHILDREN, VICTORY FOR MY SCHOOL, VICTORY
[3:22:54] FOR MY HEALTH, VICTORY FOR EVERYTHING.
[3:23:03] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:23:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:23:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:23:06] &gt;&gt; You have a problem in your life.
[3:23:08] &gt;&gt; Match the problem with your faith.
[3:23:12] &gt;&gt; You have a situation standing before
[3:23:13] you. Take the situation. Let him meet
[3:23:16] your faith.
[3:23:18] Yes sir.
[3:23:20] &gt;&gt; It is not your faith.
[3:23:22] &gt;&gt; It is the faith that was once delivered.
[3:23:24] &gt;&gt; It is the faith of the son of God.
[3:23:26] &gt;&gt; It is the faith that changes everything.
[3:23:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:23:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:23:31] &gt;&gt; The biggest error is for you to have
[3:23:33] faith and don't use it.
[3:23:37] &gt;&gt; You will die with starvation.
[3:23:39] &gt;&gt; Having money in the hand.
[3:23:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:23:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:23:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:23:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:23:45] &gt;&gt; Whenever you come to church, open up.
[3:23:47] Amen.
[3:23:52] &gt;&gt; Father, you gave me today.
[3:23:56] &gt;&gt; You say, "Give me our daily bread.
[3:23:59] &gt;&gt; I'm coming again today.
[3:24:02] &gt;&gt; To eat." You say, "MAN SHALL NOT LIVE BY
[3:24:04] BREAD ALONE,
[3:24:05] &gt;&gt; but by every word."
[3:24:07] &gt;&gt; What do you have for me, father?
[3:24:09] &gt;&gt; If you don't want to approach him like a
[3:24:11] father, approach him like a husband.
[3:24:13] &gt;&gt; Say, "What do you have for me, honey?"
[3:24:15] I know a honey have a surprise for his
[3:24:17] wife. What did YOU HAVE FOR ME in
[3:24:19] surprise today? YOU THE HUSBAND OF THE
[3:24:21] BRAND. YOU THE HUSBAND OF THE BRIDE. YOU
[3:24:24] ARE MY HEAD. YOU ARE MY EVERYTHING. WHAT
[3:24:26] DO YOU HAVE FOR ME TODAY?
[3:24:32] &gt;&gt; Speak to him where you are as they play
[3:24:36] something soft.
[3:24:44] We want that experience
[3:24:46] that burned the snake in the heart
[3:24:51] that the laying on hand of the Holy
[3:24:54] Ghost himself
[3:24:56] where you are where he can reach you. He
[3:24:59] can touch you. You say, "Father, I
[3:25:02] struggle with this thing a long time. It
[3:25:06] is coming in my life like a circle.
[3:25:09] I get better and I get better. I get bed
[3:25:13] and I get back and it seems like it's
[3:25:16] not going away. But you told me today
[3:25:19] that you deliver one faith
[3:25:22] and that faith is my victory,
[3:25:25] &gt;&gt; my victory over worry,
[3:25:27] &gt;&gt; over sickness, over frustration.
[3:25:34] &gt;&gt; It is my offense. It is my defense. You
[3:25:38] even told me today that faith can
[3:25:40] purchase the Holy Ghost.
[3:25:48] Father give me that faith that will make
[3:25:50] me overcome these things once for all so
[3:25:54] that I will be completely dead separated
[3:25:56] to this thing. I try I try it didn't
[3:25:59] work
[3:26:02] but faith is the victory. Heavenly
[3:26:04] father Lord we are approaching you
[3:26:06] humbly
[3:26:07] &gt;&gt; this afternoon. Yes, Lord.
