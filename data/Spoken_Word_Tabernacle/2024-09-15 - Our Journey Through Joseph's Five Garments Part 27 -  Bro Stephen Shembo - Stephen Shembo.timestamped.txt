[51:28] me as I'm going through this this kind
[51:31] of coat when he comes he shakes message
[51:34] people
[51:37] glory to God Amen in question and answer
[51:41] 1959 in December the 19th brother
[51:45] brandham say now you okay you ready my
[51:48] brother okay he says now my wife
[51:54] she is my correction amen
[51:59] can you say amen amen he said now you
[52:02] Brethren what I'm talking now you
[52:05] Brethren you know Brethren what I'm
[52:07] talking about she said the people in the
[52:11] back last night could not hear me
[52:13] because I was speaking into this thing
[52:16] and now before I get started I'm going
[52:18] to try something so something happened
[52:22] in the church where brother brandham was
[52:25] probably preaching or I don't know or
[52:28] testifying but I'm assuming preaching
[52:30] and the people in the back were not
[52:32] hearing well so sister maida went and
[52:37] talked to brother Bram about
[52:40] and it looks like she talked to brother
[52:42] Bram after service
[52:47] amen amen then brother Bram came back to
[52:50] church are we together and brother
[52:53] brandham said now I wonder if that is
[52:55] better brother Bram is assessing what
[52:57] she taugh him is that better way back in
[53:00] the back or is this better is this
[53:02] better now honey that is one time I got
[53:06] a mark against you so in other word
[53:08] everything was working fine and B I'm
[53:11] turning to a sense of humor right don't
[53:15] worry my friend now they say that is
[53:17] better all right oh my that is a woman
[53:20] that is a what a good one so it's a
[53:22] sense of human because it's been a long
[53:25] time since I had one she is usually what
[53:29] right
[53:31] so by this court
[53:34] I say that as a woman God put you beside
[53:38] a man for a responsibility
[53:43] you cannot condone with your husband
[53:45] when he's doing something wrong
[53:48] you are there to point out to your
[53:50] husband and tell him that that place you
[53:52] were wrong you the one that were wrong
[53:54] you the one that need to apologize
[53:57] in other words you need to help your
[53:58] husband to come back again into line
[54:02] amen so the point I want to clarify here
[54:05] it doesn't mean that when the minister
[54:07] is preaching
[54:10] out out out are we together somebody
[54:13] need to interrupt the preacher and say
[54:16] you wrong
[54:19] the correct order are we together when a
[54:23] minister is preaching and something is
[54:25] wrong you go back to the Deacon amen can
[54:29] you say Amen am and you write whatever
[54:31] you want to write on the Note amen are
[54:34] we together and the Deacon will bring it
[54:36] to the pastor and the pastor will read
[54:39] the Deacon's note and assess it amen if
[54:42] you want to make a correction during
[54:44] service sir are we together so if
[54:47] something is going on somebody's
[54:48] sleeping somebody's disturbing you just
[54:51] go back to the Deacon because they are
[54:53] the police of the police officer of the
[54:55] church amen and they they want to assess
[54:58] it because they can transgress the
[55:01] Sabbath without being guilty
[55:05] are we together Jesus spoke about the
[55:09] the PRI in the Tabernacle the work in
[55:11] the day of Sabbath but before God they
[55:14] are Guiles
[55:16] amen because they are in office are we
[55:19] together so the correct order when I'm
[55:21] preaching something is not working go
[55:24] back to the Deacon talk to the Deon and
[55:26] the Deacon will assess it if something
[55:29] is wrong with the son go back over there
[55:31] talk to the technician and the
[55:33] technician will assess it that is God's
[55:36] order
[55:38] are we together with it but God
[55:47] are we together but God cannot be
[55:51] cornered into one place right that's the
[55:55] truth
[55:58] are we together are we together let me
[56:01] read this
[56:04] brother Bram says this in question and
[56:06] answer after the seals he says but he
[56:11] God was so determined that I would not
[56:15] make that error come on now brother Amen
[56:19] brother Bram was preaching the hills and
[56:22] while he was preaching the Hills Brother
[56:24] Bram was about to make mistake
[56:28] and brother Bram say God was so
[56:30] determined that brother Bram cannot make
[56:33] a mistake
[56:38] the Seven Angels were there
[56:41] when he was preaching the seals all the
[56:43] angels that made the config that made
[56:47] that constellation every single Angel
[56:49] was there so they were watching brother
[56:52] Bram not to make even one mistake
[56:56] that's why brother BR say if there is
[56:58] anything that I ever preach that is
[57:01] inspired it is those seals
[57:05] are we together and brother Bram say God
[57:08] was watching over it so that he doesn't
[57:11] make a mistake but something happened
[57:14] yes sir follow me carefully my friend
[57:17] brother brandham say they call me back
[57:19] to read the rest of that verse yes sir
[57:22] and I just felt like something just
[57:24] rolling over me there and say go back go
[57:29] back so brother Bram was about to read
[57:32] the scripture and then the Holy Spirit
[57:35] came upon brother Bram and told Brother
[57:38] Bram do not continue reading the
[57:39] scripture go back again go back again
[57:43] are we together
[57:45] now brother Bram say I thought go back
[57:49] what stop right now and start praying
[57:52] for the sick but what is it what have I
[57:55] done
[57:57] are we together so when the Holy Ghost
[58:00] came and gave brother Bram the signal
[58:03] brother Bram was confused
[58:06] he didn't know which direction to go
[58:09] whether to stop preaching and then pray
[58:11] for the sick or what does he mean by go
[58:14] back in other words the first
[58:18] alert came straight to the prophet
[58:24] are we together are we together but
[58:27] because the prophet was having a hard
[58:29] time that's right that's right decoding
[58:32] the alert of the Holy Spirit are we
[58:35] together the Holy Spirit didn't go to
[58:38] the Deacon sir
[58:44] did you sleep well
[58:46] did you sleep well the Holy Ghost went
[58:49] on the congregation and anointed
[58:52] somebody else not the deacon
[58:56] amen
[58:57] there is a correct order but you must be
[59:00] flexible
[59:02] despite the order you must be flexible
[59:05] are we together and brother Bram say and
[59:08] I just and and just I started to reach
[59:11] for that somebody
[59:15] in the audience we don't know who it is
[59:18] somebody say what read that verse over
[59:22] again the Holy Spirit touch somebody in
[59:24] the audience and the person spoke
[59:29] [Applause]
[59:32] and say brother Bram read that over
[59:36] and brother Bram said thou was God using
[59:40] that person not the Deacon that person
[59:45] brother Bram say he say read that verse
[59:47] over and I did what read I read it over
[59:51] and there at the bottom of this question
[59:54] there was revelation
[59:56] six see I read the first that sounds
[1:00:00] like it the first see and they sang a
[1:00:02] new song but then here see what he was
[1:00:05] the next coming on down has redeemed us
[1:00:08] sure he was the Brad the Rapture sent
[1:00:11] and here certainly the lamb had the book
[1:00:14] in his hand he had done left the Throne
[1:00:16] of the meditor grace and you see how the
[1:00:19] Holy Spirit does what watches that
[1:00:23] because exactly that is the the same
[1:00:26] thing I said the other night so the
[1:00:30] correct order if something happened go
[1:00:32] see the Deacon but God in his
[1:00:35] sovereignty
[1:00:36] sometime there is no time to go check
[1:00:39] the Deacon God May anoint somebody on
[1:00:43] the congregation and that person will
[1:00:45] say Pastor go ahead and read that
[1:00:47] scripture over it is still the holy
[1:00:49] spirit in his sovereignty
[1:00:53] are we together so we got the order and
[1:00:56] we got the flexibility of the spirit I
[1:00:59] want you to understand both of them are
[1:01:01] we clear together any question about
[1:01:04] this courot
[1:01:08] no
[1:01:11] my subject this morning
[1:01:15] is our journey through Joseph's five
[1:01:18] garment part 27 let's stand for the
[1:01:21] reading of the scripture
[1:01:31] we keep the order but it remain flexible
[1:01:35] amen if not you will quench the spirit
[1:01:41] amen
[1:01:43] amen
[1:01:45] it's a great lesson for preachers
[1:01:48] you might have note
[1:01:51] and the Holy Spirit can take you off
[1:01:53] your note
[1:01:54] amen if you rigid you're going to give
[1:01:57] your mind
[1:02:01] but the mind that you're trying to give
[1:02:03] is exactly the word that you had but if
[1:02:06] you follow the flexibility of the spirit
[1:02:09] you will now minister to his children
[1:02:12] according to what he want his people to
[1:02:15] hear that day
[1:02:19] are we together so we got the order and
[1:02:22] remember God is sovereign
[1:02:30] how can you justify the money of Mary
[1:02:32] Magdalene
[1:02:39] go ask God not me go ask God he's the
[1:02:44] one that sanction it
[1:02:46] go ask God
[1:02:49] go tell God why did you take this money
[1:02:51] this money was bad you know the origin
[1:02:53] of this money
[1:02:56] yes Lord the money was used
[1:02:59] for the burial of Christ
[1:03:05] you need spoken word I hope I'm
[1:03:09] stretching you now right because what is
[1:03:12] coming up is so strong
[1:03:16] okay I will try to see if we can touch
[1:03:19] the surface
[1:03:21] we clear I changed the background so we
[1:03:24] will help the camera let's go to Psalm
[1:03:26] 82 have you seen how we stuck in one
[1:03:29] scripture and we can't go nowhere
[1:03:34] [Laughter]
[1:03:37] oh glory to God let's pray Heavenly
[1:03:40] Father Lord we approaching you humbly
[1:03:43] this morning Father thanking you for
[1:03:46] your grace for your love for your mercy

[1:03:54] with the ability you have given to me as
[1:03:56] a man but Lord when it comes to your
[1:03:59] word and to interpret your word you only
[1:04:01] take the Holy Spirit father may you move
[1:04:04] me completely out of the way may you

[1:04:10] hearing and the one interpreting and
[1:04:12] bless us may you touch this technology
[1:04:15] and may every distraction that can move
[1:04:18] Lord your children from the focus of the
[1:04:20] word be completely out of this place

[1:04:25] that are streaming in the name of Jesus

[1:18:40] if I can get this first part the second
[1:18:42] then we drive deep okay yes go uh

[1:19:20] together this scripture have layers
[1:19:24] so so you peel there is one okay and the
[1:19:27] deeper you get
[1:19:29] the more powerful it is
[1:19:33] when you on a superficial level you cast
[1:19:35] out Devils
[1:19:39] when you dig deep into a certain level
[1:19:41] you don't cast out devil devil leave you
[1:19:47] [Music]
[1:19:48] I don't know if you get me
[1:19:51] when you are arguing when you are
[1:19:53] arguing about the Jews pray here and the
[1:19:55] Samaritan pray here you can cast our
[1:19:57] devil but when you get deeper that thou
[1:20:00] a prophet
[1:20:03] if you notice that woman Jesus never
[1:20:04] prayed for her
[1:20:09] in other word the more you recognize
[1:20:12] yourself
[1:20:14] you are releasing energy
[1:20:20] and whatever was connected to you will
[1:20:23] begin to feel the Heat
[1:20:26] and the more powerful the heat you will
[1:20:29] see the the devil getting off of you
[1:20:32] because the the the energy is coming
[1:20:35] powerful
[1:20:42] do you understand what I'm saying

[1:21:06] devil are Spirit they will recognize the
[1:21:09] other Spirit

[1:21:22] without saying in Jesus name
[1:21:27] nobody cast The Devil out of the prodal

[1:23:55] substance with what righteous living
[1:23:59] righteous living
[1:24:05] what does he mean
[1:24:08] what does he mean
[1:24:11] it means disorderly
[1:24:13] it's vague
[1:24:18] Rus means anything that is bad maybe
[1:24:22] women maybe smoking may be drinking
[1:24:25] whatever it is follow me carefully this
[1:24:29] thing is vague
[1:24:32] it is not specific
[1:24:36] it's like a book like a bag of trash
[1:24:39] there is a bag but in that trash there
[1:24:41] might be a can of tomato a can of
[1:24:44] whatever but it's just a bag of trash we
[1:24:47] don't know what is in it all me
[1:24:48] carefully are we together amen verse uh
[1:24:52] 14 and when he had spend he had spend
[1:24:56] all There Rose a Great Famine in the
[1:24:59] land and he be to be in want and he went
[1:25:03] and joined himself to a citizen of the
[1:25:06] country and he sent him into the field
[1:25:08] to do what Fe SW so he became a servant
[1:25:16] he himself became a hired
[1:25:22] servant
[1:25:24] an employee
[1:25:27] he got a job
[1:25:29] amen am amen so the last state of this
[1:25:34] young man he was a hired servant we okay
[1:25:37] now yes sir the Bible says that he
[1:25:40] joined himself to a citizen of that
[1:25:42] country and he sent him into his field
[1:25:44] to feed Swan and he will F he will
[1:25:48] gladly have filled his belly with the HK
[1:25:52] that the swan did eat and no man and
[1:25:54] gave him so his last state
[1:25:59] he's an employee
[1:26:02] they send him he got a job feeding this
[1:26:04] SW a bad job for a Jew brother say that
[1:26:08] you need a cat You See Me Now verse 17
[1:26:11] where we are and when he came to himself
[1:26:15] he says how many what hi servants if you
[1:26:20] notice his last state
[1:26:24] have already conquered his mind
[1:26:27] [Music]
[1:26:30] he himself is a hired servant and the
[1:26:34] way he begin to think is at the level of
[1:26:38] a hired servant
[1:26:41] are we together in other word his father
[1:26:45] has created a scar
[1:26:51] in him
[1:26:53] are we together
[1:26:54] there is a reason why he said the higher
[1:26:56] servant because he was already a highed
[1:26:58] servant
[1:27:00] make sense now we clear verse uh uh 17
[1:27:06] and when he came to himself he said how
[1:27:08] many hired servant of my father have
[1:27:12] breed enough you see he's looking at the
[1:27:14] servant that's that's the position he's
[1:27:17] at amen and to spare and I perish with
[1:27:22] Hunger follow me carefully I will arise
[1:27:27] and go to my father
[1:27:30] and I will say to him father
[1:27:34] I have Sinn against Heaven
[1:27:39] his sin
[1:27:42] amen is against Heaven MH and what my
[1:27:47] friend and against thee and against thee
[1:27:50] yes
[1:27:52] amen have sinen against heaven
[1:27:59] and against the or in another
[1:28:03] translation say before thee
[1:28:07] amen I have seen before the
[1:28:12] amen
[1:28:14] the country was far off
[1:28:19] the son is saying I seen before thee
[1:28:24] yes
[1:28:26] the father was in another country how
[1:28:29] was he sinning in the presence of the
[1:28:31] father
[1:28:36] amen what does he mean Heaven
[1:28:42] are we together brother Bram says this
[1:28:45] in the message the F seal brother Bram
[1:28:48] say if God speaks or send you he backs
[1:28:52] up what you say mhm
[1:28:55] notice if you are an ambassador for from
[1:28:57] Heaven All Heaven is how behind you and
[1:29:01] Heaven is consisted of the word
[1:29:05] are we together amen so as sin against
[1:29:08] Heaven he broke the word amen
[1:29:13] are we together amen you need a prophet
[1:29:16] to interpret the Bible amen a sin
[1:29:19] against Heaven he broke the word he
[1:29:21] broke the Commandment amen is a
[1:29:24] scripture down there for that because
[1:29:26] brother Bram is perfectly in line with
[1:29:27] the scripture he said I sin against in
[1:29:30] other word he broke the word and I seen
[1:29:33] before the thee who is the father it
[1:29:36] seems like whatever he was doing the
[1:29:38] father saw it
[1:29:44] are we together are we together verse uh
[1:29:48] 19 and I am no more worthy to be called
[1:29:52] your son make me as one of your what
[1:29:57] hired servants because he's already a
[1:29:58] hired servant amen remember these
[1:30:01] servant are hired
[1:30:05] meaning they can get fired
[1:30:10] but a son is never hired
[1:30:14] and a son can never be fired
[1:30:19] so fall am sometime causes reper
[1:30:26] in our life until we want to put oursel
[1:30:29] into a treacherous position
[1:30:33] are we together are we together verse 20
[1:30:38] and he arose just like he said and came
[1:30:42] to his father but when he was where a
[1:30:46] great way off when he was yet a great
[1:30:49] way off his father saw him and had what
[1:30:54] compassion you see we read this
[1:30:56] scripture back and forth back and forth
[1:30:59] they say the father have compassion what
[1:31:01] do compassion me come on Brother
[1:31:05] come on
[1:31:07] the father have compassion
[1:31:10] what does he mean oh the father say oo
[1:31:14] my baby is coming
[1:31:17] oh my baby child the younger one the
[1:31:22] Benjamin
[1:31:24] William Maran Bram now watch hold that
[1:31:28] in your mind sometime you don't know
[1:31:31] what compassion means friend
[1:31:35] the people are so bound they don't
[1:31:38] understand Heavenly things we don't see
[1:31:42] compassion is to do the will of God
[1:31:48] are we together now your Bible is
[1:31:50] changing so when the father had
[1:31:53] compassion of him the father wanted to
[1:31:56] do the will of God
[1:31:59] the will of God toward the child that
[1:32:01] came back to himself
[1:32:04] [Music]
[1:32:06] glory to God there is a lot difference
[1:32:09] between what sympathy and what
[1:32:12] compassion brother Bram say now do you
[1:32:14] believe he was full of compassion
[1:32:17] bab said he was but it's different from
[1:32:21] the kind of compassion we call
[1:32:24] compassion there is two different type
[1:32:26] of compassion one of them is what human
[1:32:30] sympathy the other one is what Godly
[1:32:33] compassion Godly compassion is to do the
[1:32:36] will of God human simpathy throws
[1:32:41] everything into a what a puddle
[1:32:45] William Marion BR brother Bram say watch
[1:32:49] his answer and he say I have no one to
[1:32:52] put me in the water
[1:32:54] while I'm coming somebody's better
[1:32:57] somebody's in a better shape than uh
[1:32:59] than me I R me and get in there getting
[1:33:02] uh uh ahead of me he could walk he could
[1:33:06] go but there is some there could not
[1:33:09] even walk see and we said he had
[1:33:12] compassion
[1:33:14] human sympathy is not compassion
[1:33:17] no
[1:33:19] the will no more do no
[1:33:23] the will will of God is what compassion
[1:33:26] so compassion number one is do the will
[1:33:29] of God number two is know the will of
[1:33:32] God so the father knew
[1:33:37] the will of God brother pram continues
[1:33:40] here in the message be not afraid he
[1:33:43] says the Pharisee and the sanen cot the
[1:33:46] church question him what about all the
[1:33:49] rest of these the sick people that were
[1:33:51] there he said verily verily I said unto
[1:33:54] you the son does nothing in his himself
[1:33:57] but what he sees the father doing that
[1:34:01] does the son likewise that is what
[1:34:04] compassion compassion is follow
[1:34:11] do know now it's what follow
[1:34:16] follow the will of God Amen not human
[1:34:20] sympathy but what it is too different
[1:34:24] words Al together sympathy and
[1:34:27] compassion if he was not Jesus you made
[1:34:30] a rude mistake when he did that in other
[1:34:34] word there were thousands of people
[1:34:36] there that were sick somewhere in a bad
[1:34:40] shape compared to the man that could not
[1:34:43] that was sick of the prostate brother
[1:34:45] Bram say but God entered there and
[1:34:48] bypassed everybody and went to somebody
[1:34:52] who was suffering prostate
[1:34:54] and heal one person and get out
[1:34:59] that is compassion
[1:35:04] William Mar Bram he said listen what he
[1:35:07] said verily verily I say unto you the
[1:35:10] son after the seal do nothing in himself
[1:35:13] but what he sees the father doing there
[1:35:17] is what the compassion knowing the will
[1:35:20] of God and then what doing it now
[1:35:23] brother brother and put the two after
[1:35:24] the C so to know the will of God and to
[1:35:27] do the will of God is compassion so when
[1:35:31] this father is looking at a child that
[1:35:34] backslid
[1:35:36] that took his money and destroy
[1:35:38] everything coming back the father had
[1:35:43] compassion in another word the father
[1:35:45] took on the will of God
[1:35:49] what is the will of God toward such a
[1:35:52] child
[1:35:53] now let's read it when he had compassion
[1:35:57] he made him do what run
[1:36:00] are we there fell on his neck are we
[1:36:03] there and kiss him do you see any rebuke
[1:36:06] there no
[1:36:11] amen
[1:36:13] these are stuff that are done for a good
[1:36:15] child
[1:36:19] a sinless one
[1:36:23] amen but for some reason it's done on a
[1:36:25] criminal
[1:36:29] let's continue my friend amen am wait
[1:36:33] when I get where I'm going amen the
[1:36:36] Bible says and the son said to him
[1:36:39] remember this we went through this
[1:36:41] father I have Sinn against heaven in
[1:36:44] other word I have broken that
[1:36:46] commandment in your s and I'm not wor no
[1:36:49] more worthy to be called your son but
[1:36:56] the father said to his servant the one
[1:36:58] he was about to say Amen sir amen bring
[1:37:03] forth the best robe
[1:37:08] the best Rob is given to the best child
[1:37:12] that's right
[1:37:16] are we together in other word there was
[1:37:19] something about this boy amen amen that
[1:37:23] was special
[1:37:25] and the father lost him under his radar
[1:37:29] come on in other words a big player to
[1:37:33] the economy of the father and when the
[1:37:36] father recuperate that player the father
[1:37:40] said praise God now the team is going to
[1:37:42] change
[1:37:45] because the best player the MVP is
[1:37:47] coming back
[1:37:51] [Music]
[1:37:53] I know what stumbles you because he did
[1:37:56] bad stuff that's all you have in your
[1:37:58] mind I will get to the bad stuff amen he
[1:38:02] said give him the best Rob amen we there
[1:38:07] he said give him the best robe and put
[1:38:09] it on him and put a ring on him you know
[1:38:12] what it means and shoes on his feet and
[1:38:15] bring here the fatted Cal and kill it
[1:38:19] and let us eat and be how mered for this
[1:38:22] son was dead
[1:38:27] this son
[1:38:29] was dead amen
[1:38:33] and now he's what alive now he's alive
[1:38:36] continue my friend and he was what he
[1:38:38] was lost he was lost and now he's what
[1:38:41] and is found do you know what lost me
[1:38:47] dead means dead in sins and trespasses
[1:38:50] according to Ephesian 2 let's
[1:38:52] investigate loss are we there go back to
[1:38:56] verse four
[1:38:59] same scripture verse four I need to
[1:39:02] drive this then we can move if you
[1:39:04] thereare you can say amen amen Jesus say
[1:39:07] what man of you having aund sheep if he
[1:39:12] loses what one do you see the word lose
[1:39:17] okay one of them does not leave the 99
[1:39:21] in the wilderness and go after that
[1:39:23] which is what lost we're trying to get
[1:39:26] the definition of the word lost amen and
[1:39:31] until he founds it and when he had found
[1:39:33] it you see found do you see found lost
[1:39:36] and found do you see those two words
[1:39:38] when he founded he lays it on his
[1:39:41] shoulder it's a mystery there rejoicing
[1:39:45] and when he come home he calls together
[1:39:48] his friend and what neighbors and
[1:39:50] neighbors saying to them Rejoice with me
[1:39:54] for I have found my sheep which was lost
[1:39:58] so we found lost and found we clear what
[1:40:02] is the interpretation Jesus verse 7 and
[1:40:05] I say to you that likewise
[1:40:08] amen
[1:40:10] likewise Joy shall be where in heaven of
[1:40:14] a what one sinner that have what so lost
[1:40:19] is a s lost and found is a sinner that
[1:40:22] have repented amen
[1:40:25] I'm I'm reading the is my Bible
[1:40:27] different than yours so lost and found
[1:40:30] means a sinner
[1:40:33] [Applause]
[1:40:35] that has what
[1:40:38] repented amen a sinner that has repented
[1:40:42] in other words my child was a sinner he
[1:40:46] already repented and now he was dead and
[1:40:49] alive what does dead and alive means
[1:40:54] do you follow me do you follow me I have
[1:40:56] to go that way my friend he says let's
[1:41:00] uh keep your finger right there go to
[1:41:02] Ephesian 2
[1:41:05] because we got to drive this correctly
[1:41:10] don't worry my friend
[1:41:12] Ephesians chapter 2 if you thereare you
[1:41:14] can say Amen
[1:41:18] verse one my friend you there amen and
[1:41:21] you has he what Quicken Quicken means to
[1:41:25] make a love that's right who were how
[1:41:28] dead in what trespasses and what sin so
[1:41:33] dead you are dead in sin
[1:41:38] amen and trespasses
[1:41:40] and a love means the son was quicken in
[1:41:44] other word what the father is saying
[1:41:46] here when we go back to Luke 15 the
[1:41:49] father is saying that my son that you
[1:41:51] see is a son that was dead in sin and
[1:41:55] trespasses
[1:41:56] he has repented he was a sinner that had
[1:41:59] repented and he has been quickened
[1:42:06] are we together are we together if you
[1:42:09] notice there is no description about
[1:42:12] what the son did
[1:42:15] follow me carefully
[1:42:21] Angel come here put robe on him put this
[1:42:24] on him put this on him what is the
[1:42:27] reason the reason he was dead and he's
[1:42:29] alive
[1:42:33] what does dead mean dead in sin and
[1:42:36] trespasses what kind of sins
[1:42:40] follow me carefully sins plural
[1:42:43] trespasses plural what kind the
[1:42:46] trespasses what can the sin and he is a
[1:42:50] sinner that has what repented sinner is
[1:42:55] vague
[1:42:57] because you can be in your life never
[1:42:59] even drunk any beer but you a sinner
[1:43:03] so sinner means what means a drag addict
[1:43:07] a church sinner a prostitute because
[1:43:11] when we say sin we always look at bad
[1:43:13] stuff but sin is unbelief
[1:43:17] if you never believe you are a sinner
[1:43:20] amen are we together are we together
[1:43:23] together what I'm trying to show you
[1:43:25] here is when you question the father
[1:43:28] follow me carefully the father answer is
[1:43:32] vague
[1:43:34] amen
[1:43:37] you say what did he do he was a sinner
[1:43:40] that repented
[1:43:43] what did he do he was dead
[1:43:46] dead yes dead in sin and trespasses
[1:43:50] in other word he looks like what
[1:43:53] happened to the child
[1:43:56] have affected the memory of the father
[1:44:01] this is where we driving my friend
[1:44:07] when you ask the father what did he do
[1:44:09] he was dead and he's alive he was lost
[1:44:12] and he's found
[1:44:14] because when people ask what did he do
[1:44:16] they want detail
[1:44:18] when the people come in the message they
[1:44:20] say sister what happened they want a det
[1:44:24] and if you say no it's just a problem
[1:44:26] they don't want that what kind of
[1:44:28] problem because they want a detail they
[1:44:31] want to Nick peek everything
[1:44:35] [Applause]
[1:44:36] what happened between so and so oh H
[1:44:38] just pray for them something is going on
[1:44:40] what really happen what what what they

[1:44:57] they ask the father what happened he
[1:44:58] said he was dead and he's alive amen he
[1:45:01] was lost and his father in other words
[1:45:05] the father is unable to bring out the
[1:45:09] detail
[1:45:17] the child sin before heaven and before
[1:45:21] the father but when he did what he did
[1:45:24] it looks like the father lost some data
[1:45:28] yes he
[1:45:30] don't worry my friend
[1:45:32] [Applause]

[1:55:50] you turn to the younger brother happened
[1:55:52] he say he finish everything and he play
[1:55:56] with the prostitute that's right
[1:56:00] and if you notice the young the older
[1:56:03] brother is reminding the father
[1:56:12] are we together in other words the
[1:56:14] oldest son is telling Daddy what you're
[1:56:17] doing is not logic
[1:56:20] that's right maybe you missing the the
[1:56:24] point here this kind of I mean this kind
[1:56:28] of case are treated a certain way why
[1:56:31] because look at what he did
[1:56:37] are we together so the old son
[1:56:41] the old son remembers
[1:56:47] all the hots and everything that happen
[1:56:50] in detail but the father doesn't
[1:56:53] remember
[1:56:55] as soon as the son repented the mind of
[1:56:59] the father was different
[1:57:03] so one go remember one remember
[1:57:07] the furtherest the father can go is he
[1:57:11] was dead and alive he was lost and his F
[1:57:17] but the other brother goes beyond that
[1:57:20] no he spend your money with riers living
[1:57:25] and to be specific he was going to
[1:57:27] prostitute
[1:57:29] one remember one don't remember
[1:57:33] and based on who remember and who don't
[1:57:35] remember the treatment is different
[1:57:40] the one who remember want punishment
[1:57:43] the one who doesn't remember treat you
[1:57:45] as a best child
[1:57:51] are we together are we together where
[1:57:54] are you going with this are we together
[1:57:58] are we together that's why before even
[1:58:03] the son come and spoke the father
[1:58:07] already responded and remember Isaiah
[1:58:10] say that it shall come to pass that
[1:58:13] before you call I will do what answer
[1:58:17] remember Jesus before he pray his prayer
[1:58:19] is already answered so we get to reach a
[1:58:22] point where our prayer must be answer
[1:58:25] like Jesus prayer
[1:58:30] are we together are we together are we
[1:58:34] together let's go to John 17 now you

[2:17:57] so that you can become God
[2:18:02] and Jesus is praying according to the
[2:18:04] will of the father but when you realize

[2:37:35] heading toward the airport this book of
[2:37:37] memory is not the book of life
[2:37:42] it took the Holy Spirit to be merciful
[2:37:44] on me because I wanted this for a long

[2:37:48] was and gave gave me the qu amen amen in
[2:37:53] the exposition of the churches in the
[2:37:56] sest church brother Bram say to begin
[2:37:59] with there is no basis for the claim
[2:38:02] that the lamp's book of life is not the
[2:38:05] same as the Book of Life The Book of
[2:38:09] Life might be called what the Lamb's
[2:38:11] Book of Life or Christ Book of Life or
[2:38:16] that book of that book of the living
[2:38:20] what names are written in it so in the

[2:39:01] the church ages brother Bram say the
[2:39:03] scripture that called The Book of Life
[2:39:06] that book and brother Bram gave Exodus
[2:39:09] 32 32-33

[2:39:19] if thou will forgive their sin if not do
[2:39:22] what me me Moses block me I pray thee
[2:39:27] out of what thy book which is what and

[2:39:48] whatsoever whosoever have sin against me
[2:39:51] him will I do what blood out of my book
[2:39:54] Because The Book of Life only contain
[2:39:57] what names that are but if you look at
