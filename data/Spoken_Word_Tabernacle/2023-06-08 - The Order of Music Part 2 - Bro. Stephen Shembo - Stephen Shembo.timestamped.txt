[0:00] God bless you all
[0:03] and this is Brother Stephen chamble
[0:06] local pacifier in spoken word Tabernacle
[0:09] of Gastonia here in North Carolina in
[0:12] the United States
[0:13] this is an expo that we have done in uh
[0:17] about music
[0:19] and music has been such a treacherous
[0:22] subject
[0:23] very contradictory in the past until
[0:26] that we noticed that the music that the
[0:30] message Believers are listening to up to
[0:33] now got into the way that is swayed to
[0:36] the world
[0:37] there is no gauge there is no standard
[0:39] for it and we felt impressed in our
[0:42] heart to be able to address this subject
[0:45] before humility and uh according to the
[0:49] message of the hour and we trust that
[0:52] this exposition of music will be a
[0:55] tremendous blessing to you and for those
[0:59] who are local Shepherd that are Shepherd
[1:01] many group all over the world if you
[1:03] come across this uh table this video you
[1:07] can use it as a baseline And I know
[1:09] there are several quotes that brother
[1:11] Branham mentioned about music but I was
[1:14] not able to put it all there but at
[1:17] least we have a call from where we can
[1:20] work together and then you can add every
[1:23] single
[1:24] remaining code into it for the
[1:26] betterment of your church so enjoy music
[1:31] part one and then don't stop at part one
[1:34] because that's not all you will continue
[1:36] with music part two all the way to part
[1:38] three and I believe by the grace of God
[1:41] the Holy Spirit Will Enlighten you and
[1:43] make sure that whatever predicament the
[1:46] devil tried to bring into this message
[1:48] will be stopped and the children of God
[1:51] will be free to worship God in the
[1:54] spirit and in the truth with their
[1:56] clapping with their dancing with the
[1:58] music and music that is acceptable and
[2:01] appropriate for the children of God God
[2:04] richly bless you we love you of Bride of
[2:07] Jesus Christ but Stephen Shea thank you
[2:18] thank you
[2:24] [Music]
[2:32] amen
[2:34] I stand for the reading of the scripture
[2:39] amen
[2:41] God richly bless you sorry we lost 30
[2:44] minutes
[2:46] trying to give
[2:47] a little bit of time for the people that
[2:50] were coming behind because of the
[2:52] weather or some I don't know if if there
[2:55] was a traffic or something so I was
[2:57] already here on time
[3:00] so it's not on my end
[3:02] it's on the uh
[3:04] somebody else and amen I was here but we
[3:07] just extended some long suffering just
[3:10] like God
[3:12] he did it in the time of Noah amen it's
[3:15] a little bit of long suffering let's be
[3:17] like our father amen
[3:19] Hallelujah let's go to First Corinthians
[3:22] chapter 11.
[3:24] I had everybody with thumbs up but
[3:26] people are still not here
[3:34] First Corinthians chapter 11 verse 29
[3:38] same scripture
[3:40] and we will
[3:42] recap a little and take off amen
[3:46] I hope I trust everybody is good there
[3:48] is fight going on everywhere with the
[3:50] Devil but we are fine amen amen
[3:57] amen if I want to give you
[3:59] some encouragement
[4:02] you should be stronger than me
[4:05] I went to sleep really late after 4 AM
[4:10] okay and I have to wake up
[4:13] bike phone call
[4:16] amen and since I woke up I can't go back
[4:20] to bed
[4:21] so you should be stronger First
[4:23] Corinthians 11 verse 29 if you're there
[4:26] you can say Amen
[4:28] I appreciate the
[4:31] sacrifice some of you got birthday like
[4:35] brother Angelo and he's here sister that
[4:37] is here I know what's going on at home
[4:39] with Grandma's uh birthday and
[4:43] everything so God will reward you for
[4:45] the sacrifice
[4:47] 20 uh nine
[4:50] fajita Edith and drinketh unworthily
[4:55] Edith and drinketh dalmatian to himself
[4:59] not Discerning the Lord's body you might
[5:03] be seated we all know that the Lord's
[5:06] body is the church
[5:09] amen
[5:10] the Lord's body is not what the Catholic
[5:13] told us by the Lord's body is the church
[5:16] and the key there is getting among the
[5:20] believer and doing things that are not
[5:23] correct
[5:24] amen not Discerning the Lord's body not
[5:28] Discerning the church that God is in the
[5:30] midst of his church he can get you in
[5:32] trouble amen Paul says in verse 30 that
[5:35] for this cause many are weak
[5:39] and sickly among you and many sleep you
[5:43] know what that word means we don't want
[5:46] that to happen amen verse 31 for if we
[5:50] would judge ourselves
[5:53] we should not be judged that makes our
[5:55] life easy but how do you judge yourself
[5:57] with which caliber which standard there
[6:01] is only one standard not brother Stephen
[6:03] Stander but it's the word of God amen
[6:07] glory to God thank you my brother but
[6:10] when we are judged we are chasten of the
[6:14] Lord if it happened that God is pointing
[6:17] something out it is not really the
[6:19] preacher it is God who's chastening you
[6:22] that we should not be condemned with the
[6:24] world so all that God is trying to do is
[6:27] to avoid you from going into
[6:28] condemnation with the world God doesn't
[6:31] want you to get lost he doesn't want you
[6:33] to go to hell God want to save you and
[6:36] he's chastening you not because he want
[6:39] to lose you but he want to save you amen
[6:42] that's the way we should take correction
[6:44] amen wait for my brethren when you come
[6:47] together to eat Terry one for another
[6:50] and if any man hunger let him let him
[6:54] eat a home that she come not together
[6:56] unto condemnation we don't want any
[6:59] pressure anything going on here if
[7:01] you're hungry eat it at home because
[7:03] here you can get in trouble by the
[7:05] presence of the holy spirit in the midst
[7:08] of the people amen and the rest will
[7:11] last said how
[7:13] so we got some order there we'll set
[7:16] we'll add set in order
[7:18] so having order in the church is
[7:21] something good
[7:22] when you don't have order then we need
[7:24] help amen
[7:26] let's go to uh chapter 14.
[7:30] glory to God
[7:34] Chapter 14 verse 33.
[7:37] if you dare you can say Amen
[7:41] amen
[7:42] for God
[7:44] is not the author of confusion
[7:48] so when you see confusion it's not God
[7:51] we don't have to argue we don't even
[7:53] need quotes if it's a confusion it's not
[7:56] God because God is not the author of
[7:58] confusion he said God is not the author
[8:01] of confusion but of peace as in all
[8:05] churches of the sin and we want a peace
[8:08] of God in this church not confusion as
[8:11] soon as you see confusion in the church
[8:12] just know don't jump into that confusion
[8:15] don't be partaker of it because it's the
[8:17] devil amen God is the author of Peace
[8:21] amen job to verse 40 let all things
[8:27] be done how
[8:29] and how
[8:30] so if something is not decent is it good
[8:36] everything
[8:41] must be done
[8:43] two ways we want it to be done decently
[8:47] and we want it to be done in order if
[8:50] you don't see these two words into a
[8:52] clip song
[8:54] turn that clip off
[8:57] everybody okay if you look at the video
[8:59] it's not decent
[9:00] don't even sit there arguing whether
[9:03] this is uh a religion song or something
[9:06] just take it out amen glory to God let's
[9:11] go to tadas then we pray
[9:15] so the first scripture is talking about
[9:17] the order the second scripture it's
[9:19] talking about doing everything in order
[9:21] amen because God is not the author of
[9:24] confusion the third one it's in the book
[9:27] of tardis speaking again in God order
[9:33] chapter 1 verse 4. if you dare you can
[9:36] say Amen
[9:38] to tell us my own son after they come on
[9:41] faith grace mercy and peace from God the
[9:45] father and the Lord Jesus Christ Our
[9:47] Savior for this cause left eye in Crete
[9:50] left Rd in Crete that that should set in
[9:54] order
[9:55] the things that are wanting so certain
[9:58] things were not correct in the church
[10:00] but Paul gave instruction so that tadas
[10:03] can put those things in order can put
[10:06] the church in order and Paul was the
[10:08] messenger of the church and he gave it
[10:11] to Titus so Titus can bring that order
[10:14] back into the church that's why the
[10:15] order will get we get it from the
[10:17] messenger of the hour amen he says that
[10:21] should set in order the things that are
[10:23] wanting that are lacking and ordained
[10:26] Elders in every city as I have appointed
[10:30] thee so the way Titus was doing it is
[10:34] exactly according to the instruction of
[10:37] Paul not the instruction of Titus but
[10:39] the instructor of the instruction of the
[10:42] messenger because he was the one that
[10:45] God give the letter to and that's God on
[10:48] provided way amen let's pray Heavenly
[10:51] Father Lord we are approaching you
[10:53] humbly again father this evening Lord
[10:56] thanking you once again for your grace
[10:58] for your love for your mercy and for
[11:01] this great opportunity that you have
[11:03] given us to sit together as a family and
[11:06] to speak about the things that belongs
[11:08] to the kingdom to your children
[11:10] especially this uh important crucial
[11:14] topic of Music Lord father if there is
[11:17] anything that we have done
[11:19] in our life that we have grieved the
[11:22] Holy Spirit Lord we ask you forgiveness
[11:24] father we pray that the blood of the
[11:27] Lamb purify our body may you purify our
[11:31] spirit and soul may everything Lord
[11:33] father be done and put under the blood
[11:35] Lord and may you look at us through the
[11:38] blood because when you look through the
[11:40] blood that's the only way Lord father we
[11:42] can be acceptable in your sight father
[11:45] be the beginning and the ending of this
[11:47] session Lord father may you move
[11:49] everything contrary to your divine
[11:51] nature away from this place and for
[11:53] those that are still coming on the road
[11:55] Lord father may you protect them and
[11:58] give them travel Mercy they are your
[12:00] children Lord the some have Lord left
[12:03] some important things Lord father to be
[12:05] here tonight I pray that a special Lord
[12:08] father blessing be granted unto them
[12:10] Lord give us the action for the work we
[12:13] committed unto that hand and we rebuke
[12:15] the devil away from this place in the
[12:18] name of Jesus Christ
[12:20] amen everybody good I'm just gonna go
[12:24] with a quick recap because we had a big
[12:27] gap between the time that we had part
[12:30] one to part two so if I continue
[12:32] straight ahead we might have a gap or
[12:34] somebody can get lost somewhere if you
[12:37] put your name on to have uh this quote I
[12:41] gave them to the Deacon and they will
[12:43] hand it to you whoever put the name on
[12:45] they will have it if you didn't put the
[12:47] name on so uh you don't have one amen
[12:51] glory to God last time we start the
[12:54] topic of music and we established the
[12:57] first point was the two Kingdom you
[13:00] remember that we had two Kingdom and the
[13:03] kingdom of God
[13:04] and the kingdom of the devil amen this
[13:08] kingdom are two sources or two power
[13:10] whichever way we're gonna call it we got
[13:13] two power we got two sources we got two
[13:16] Kingdom everything that is in this world
[13:18] or outside of this world is either
[13:21] directed by God or it's directed by the
[13:24] devil amen there is no middle ground
[13:26] that is there and we found out from
[13:28] these two sources we also have two
[13:31] musics
[13:32] amen the first is a Godly music which is
[13:36] a Divine music which is a music that we
[13:39] sing in church which is a Christian
[13:41] music we call that Spiritual music and
[13:44] the other one is a devilish music or a
[13:47] satanic music or a secular music or a
[13:52] worldly music amen and we found out that
[13:55] both God and the devil seek worshiper
[13:58] you remember that I'm just refreshing so
[14:01] we can take off amen both of them need
[14:04] worshiper but there is one person who is
[14:07] the devil the devil really doesn't care
[14:10] about how you worship him as long as you
[14:13] worship Him amen the only person that
[14:15] care about the way you worship Him is
[14:17] God because God wanted to be worshiped
[14:21] in the spirit and he wanted to be
[14:23] worshiped in the truth so if you have
[14:26] the spirit you must also have the truth
[14:30] everybody okay if you have the anointing
[14:32] of God in you make sure that anointing
[14:35] is traveling through the truth because
[14:37] you can get the anointing of God but
[14:39] you're in error
[14:41] everybody remember that amen we want to
[14:44] make sure whatever you do if you get the
[14:46] spirit of God he must be in spirit and
[14:49] in truth everybody okay and then we
[14:52] found out that God is in music
[14:55] by the right kind of music God is
[14:57] indexing the right kind of dancing God
[15:00] is in shouting the right kind of
[15:02] shouting amen so there is a good kind of
[15:05] shouting and a wrong one there is a good
[15:07] kind of dancing and there is a wrong one
[15:09] there is a good kind of singing music
[15:12] and there is a wrong one amen then the
[15:15] third point if I'm not mistaken that we
[15:17] had we established the condition of the
[15:20] age what is going on in this age which
[15:23] age are we living in amen what is the
[15:27] this uh the deception of this age and we
[15:30] found out that this Sage is an age that
[15:33] by prophecy it's a lukewarm age
[15:36] amen because God gave the prophecy
[15:40] either you're gonna be hot and to be at
[15:43] ease on the camp of God or you're going
[15:46] to be called and to be called you are in
[15:48] a camp of Satan amen but the age is not
[15:51] that way the age is an age of
[15:54] lukewarmness in other words if we bring
[15:58] something Godly you will swallow without
[16:00] any problem because it looks like God it
[16:02] is Godly there is no problem if they
[16:04] bring something that is satanic a
[16:07] worldly music from a nightclub or from a
[16:10] secular musician automatically you will
[16:12] reject it because you know that you come
[16:15] up from the world you're already a
[16:17] Christian you're already baptized you're
[16:19] already serving the lord automatically
[16:20] you're going to reject any artist that
[16:23] is uh Wordly or secular amen but the
[16:26] problem the reason why really we have
[16:29] this subject of music it is not about
[16:32] the satanic music
[16:33] because if someone is here instead of
[16:36] listening to satanic music then we got a
[16:39] big problem in other words you're not
[16:40] Christian yet you are not a Christian
[16:43] you're not even born again you're still
[16:45] living in sin so that's not the big
[16:47] question it's easy to see if something
[16:49] is Godly there is nothing wrong if we
[16:51] sing here only believe all things are
[16:54] possible nobody will have a problem with
[16:56] that if we sing Amazing Grace even in
[16:59] the uh presidential inauguration they
[17:02] will sing Amazing Grace everybody can
[17:04] sing you can say Amen there is nothing
[17:07] wrong with Amazing Grace but the reason
[17:09] we are here the reason we are LED into
[17:12] talking about music is because of this
[17:16] music Amen in the laodicea churches you
[17:20] have a music that is not really hot
[17:24] amen it is not even really cold but it's
[17:28] a music that is mixed
[17:31] amen this is the hardest music that
[17:34] you're gonna have
[17:35] because this music have Godly stuff in
[17:38] it
[17:39] amen the reason why it's deceiving
[17:42] because it's Godly it won't deceive you
[17:44] if there is nothing of God inside of it
[17:47] hey everybody okay and I'm gonna read
[17:49] this scripture again so we can really
[17:51] get this refresh pretty well let's go to
[17:54] Matthew chapter 7.
[17:57] glory to God
[18:04] amen
[18:06] normally everybody should be here
[18:09] I have people that are not part of this
[18:11] church that are begging to get this
[18:13] music
[18:17] someone even put on YouTube they say
[18:20] brother Stephen can you
[18:22] in other words can you release the tape
[18:26] amen Matthew 7 verse 21.
[18:31] if you dare you can say Amen
[18:40] I was on the wrong spot okay 7 21 amen
[18:45] the Bible says not everyone that say
[18:48] unto me
[18:51] now I'm gonna refresh this because it's
[18:54] important as we're gonna move
[18:56] these people are not calling Satan
[18:59] correctly I know everybody okay if your
[19:03] perspective about music is because
[19:05] they're saying Jesus
[19:07] it's a good music
[19:09] you're wasting your time
[19:11] and you're gonna get full
[19:12] amen so saying Lord doesn't mean that
[19:16] it's something God like
[19:18] it's something you might like because
[19:20] it's they say God Amen but that's not it
[19:23] they're not saying Satan certain because
[19:26] if they say certain you won't even waste
[19:28] one second you will shut down your
[19:30] computer and remove and reboot the whole
[19:32] computer maybe a virus got into it
[19:35] amen because you don't want nothing to
[19:37] do with Satan but when they say Lord
[19:39] Lord you say wait a minute I understand
[19:41] but he's praising the Lord
[19:43] this is where our fastest come from
[19:46] amen which music are you listening I'm
[19:48] using it to a Christian music amen so
[19:51] the Bible say not everyone that say Lord
[19:55] Lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[19:58] water
[19:59] but he that doeth the will of My Father
[20:03] which is in heaven so there are many
[20:06] people that are calling God their God
[20:08] but they are not living the Christian
[20:10] Life and because of that they're going
[20:12] to miss heaven verse 22 the Bible say I
[20:16] don't know what's wrong my brain my
[20:18] brother amen
[20:20] amen amen
[20:22] glory to God
[20:27] so he means something is really
[20:30] bothering him
[20:31] oh it's not you my brother there I know
[20:33] who start those kind of stuff he's the
[20:35] prince of the power of the air amen okay
[20:39] verse 22 many will say to me in that day
[20:43] Lord Lord
[20:45] have we not prophesied in the name
[20:49] how can somebody prophesy something in
[20:53] the name of the Lord and he is right in
[20:56] his prophecy and you're going to prove
[20:58] to me that that person is wrong
[21:00] that's the level of laodicea
[21:03] amen
[21:05] so don't expect your biggest star this
[21:08] day to be singing for the devil he says
[21:11] and in that name have cast out what
[21:14] devils and in that name done many
[21:17] wonderful works so to cast that devil to
[21:21] prophesy to do many miracles Amen in the
[21:26] name of the Lord not in the name of
[21:27] Satan verse 23
[21:30] and then we love profess this is Jesus
[21:33] unto them I never know you
[21:37] so every song they have sung every album
[21:40] every work they have done for the Lord
[21:43] every fast thing they went
[21:46] 30 days fasting before they go to the
[21:49] big convention and there is mass healing
[21:51] all of that in the eyes of God
[21:54] zero
[21:57] in the eyes of the Republic everybody
[22:00] knows about it
[22:01] if I need to change that fun
[22:04] you want me switch okay
[22:17] should be the best one praise God
[22:21] amen
[22:23] and the Bible says and I will profess to
[22:26] unto them and never know you thank you
[22:28] my brother thank you uh brother said I
[22:32] never knew you depart from me or from me
[22:35] ye that work what
[22:38] so the age of flower this year this
[22:41] mixing is coming with iniquity
[22:45] amen iniquity means
[22:49] something that you already know about
[22:51] you what you continue to do it so this
[22:55] mixing is mixed with iniquity
[22:59] everybody okay so it doesn't mean they
[23:02] don't know the word they just don't want
[23:03] to do it
[23:05] it doesn't mean that they don't know
[23:06] that a man or a woman should dress
[23:08] properly no they just don't want to
[23:10] dress like that but they want to sing
[23:13] for the Lord they want to do service for
[23:15] the Lord they want to cast out therefore
[23:17] they want to have convention they want
[23:19] to have big concert
[23:21] in Charlotte
[23:22] everybody okay but they don't want to be
[23:26] conformed to the word they are workers
[23:28] of iniquity that is the condition of the
[23:31] age this is where the problem is this is
[23:33] where I have a hard time
[23:36] getting the young people to understand
[23:37] this thing
[23:42] because it's in the name of the Lord
[23:45] amen now the fifth point or the fourth
[23:49] point that we got
[23:52] is the music itself
[23:55] amen we Define music
[23:59] as vocal sound
[24:01] you remember that all instrumental sound
[24:05] amen or a combination of both
[24:09] amen
[24:11] that are combined in a way to produce a
[24:14] beauty of form remember that which is
[24:17] the genre which is the type of music a
[24:21] beauty of Harmony I'm almost done with
[24:25] the review and produce some expression
[24:28] with expression either it's going to be
[24:30] some Joy some lifting of hand some
[24:33] clapping of hand and some dancing
[24:38] amen
[24:40] Etc everybody okay and by vocal we found
[24:44] out that the vocal part have a lyric or
[24:47] words part
[24:49] amen
[24:50] and you have also a non-word on
[24:54] non-linguistic part
[24:56] you remember that right you can play
[24:59] music without using any word brother
[25:01] Branham say that the bird remember that
[25:04] remember even the scripture they were
[25:06] playing music but the bird don't use
[25:08] word they're just singing It's music
[25:11] amen but by word this is what we usually
[25:13] do most of the time and then we got
[25:16] instrumental
[25:18] amen instrumental we went through First
[25:21] Corinthian and we found out all kind of
[25:23] instruments that Paul says amen now the
[25:27] fifth point which was the dangerous
[25:29] Point amen
[25:30] was about the sound
[25:34] everybody okay
[25:35] it was about the sound
[25:37] this is probably where we stop
[25:40] and the sound we found out that this
[25:43] sound carries messages
[25:49] amen so when we talk it now what are we
[25:53] taking off amen so when we're talking
[25:56] about music amen especially the kind of
[25:59] music we we have among the question most
[26:03] of them it's a combination of vocal with
[26:06] instrumental amen but the biggest key if
[26:09] you don't get this you won't understand
[26:11] brother Branham and we will continue to
[26:13] fast all the time the biggest key is
[26:16] usually when we say vocal we're looking
[26:19] at our messages to be carry on the vocal
[26:24] but that's not the case
[26:26] amen the message of music is carried
[26:29] before
[26:31] amen you get a
[26:35] let me write it this way vocal and you
[26:38] got an instrumental
[26:43] amen there is a message that is planned
[26:49] easy to decode
[26:52] amen easy to decode that is the vocal as
[26:57] long as you know the language
[26:59] amen if I sing in French some of you
[27:03] will know some of you don't know even
[27:05] though I'm speaking vocal amen even
[27:07] though I'm singing vocal but if you can
[27:10] get a translator then you know exactly
[27:12] what I'm talking about everybody okay so
[27:14] vocal is plain it's very easy to see
[27:18] because it's in Word
[27:20] everybody okay we clear the biggest
[27:23] problem of the sound of the music is
[27:26] when it's instrumental
[27:28] usually we think instrumental does and
[27:31] carry the message but that is where the
[27:34] devil usually hide
[27:37] everybody okay the devil will not attack
[27:40] you on the vocal
[27:42] because if the devil tells you clearly
[27:45] that hey you need to worship me you will
[27:47] refuse
[27:48] because that's a vocal it is planned
[27:51] everything is clear you can decode the
[27:53] devil and say no this is devilish it's
[27:55] out the problem of music and if you go
[27:59] through across the message what brother
[28:01] Branham was pointing about the music was
[28:04] not really the word of music
[28:09] no problem we will get to that Amen
[28:11] brother Branham was not really pointing
[28:14] about the word because before a music
[28:16] can be accepted in this church it must
[28:19] be Christian
[28:22] we okay now if it's not Christian you're
[28:25] gonna reject it so every word must match
[28:28] the Bible so if you bring me a music
[28:31] from any artist you want to put it here
[28:33] you already know that he must have word
[28:35] from the Bible and some of you will even
[28:37] argue that what they already what they
[28:40] are talking about is exactly like the
[28:42] message of the hour
[28:45] some of you will say no no no no no when
[28:47] I listen this is uh we are a generation
[28:50] prayers for them
[28:54] how do you sing that again
[28:56] huh I know who I am all of that you know
[29:00] what I mean if you sit in the message
[29:02] you follow all of that no problem
[29:05] he zeroed in with the message we are the
[29:08] new generation I know who I am amen
[29:12] amen that is not a problem the devil
[29:15] knows that the problem is what is the
[29:18] message within the message
[29:20] everybody okay the danger of music is
[29:24] not the vocal they know that we must put
[29:26] it Christian the problem is the devil
[29:29] work with the instrumental
[29:32] I have everybody okay by Instrumental we
[29:36] are talking about the Rhythm
[29:39] we are talking about your tap
[29:42] we are talking about your genre
[29:46] you remember our God is an awesome God
[29:48] do you remember you can sing it good or
[29:51] you can wrap it
[29:52] amen whoever sang it and Rapid if we put
[29:56] it in writing both of them look the same
[29:58] but the problem is when you wrap it you
[30:02] have another
[30:03] beat and the beat have another message
[30:06] within it because sounds carries water
[30:13] every problem any problem
[30:17] let's go to second king we just had it
[30:19] recently
[30:21] ah man
[30:25] if you don't understand this you will be
[30:27] in love with Kirk Franklin
[30:32] you see when I say those names you heard
[30:34] amen because to Kirk Franklin everything
[30:37] that was sung before have to be changed
[30:40] he's not sometimes he doesn't even
[30:41] change the music itself the vocal he
[30:45] changed it in a certain way so that the
[30:47] young people can go
[30:49] let's go this way
[30:52] that's it
[30:54] [Laughter]
[30:56] ah the pastor sees a lot
[31:01] amen
[31:03] amen let's go to second king chapter
[31:07] seven glory to God
[31:11] oh my my my my
[31:13] second king chapter seven
[31:17] music is a very difficult situation
[31:20] even in the message churches
[31:23] amen
[31:26] you there
[31:28] ARA you know this story right verse 5.
[31:32] if you were there on Wednesday you know
[31:33] that story
[31:35] it's about the four lepers
[31:37] you remember when they took when they
[31:40] made the decision they say we're going
[31:41] to go to the camp of the Syrian verse 5.
[31:44] the Bible says and they rose up in the
[31:46] Twilight
[31:47] to go on to the camp of the Syrian and
[31:50] when they were come to the other most
[31:52] part of the camp of the Syrian behold
[31:54] there was no man there
[31:57] a whole army with tank
[32:02] with airplane
[32:03] Air Force all kind of army deserted and
[32:08] went away who chased them away
[32:12] amen who chased them away who fought
[32:15] against them
[32:17] watch verse 6. for the Lord
[32:21] has made the host
[32:23] of the Syrian to hear a water
[32:30] so there is a sound that was sent from
[32:33] God
[32:34] everybody okay but when God sent the son
[32:38] he was just not an empty sound
[32:41] that sound had a message
[32:45] and when you understand the message it's
[32:48] going to do something to you
[32:52] am I reading a different Bible
[32:54] but the message that was coming from the
[32:56] sound now let me ask you a question was
[32:58] there any Chariot coming
[33:00] was there any horses coming
[33:03] so music can make a chariot where there
[33:06] is no chariot
[33:11] everybody okay
[33:12] everybody okay music the sound sound can
[33:16] make something
[33:18] sound exactly like a car when there is
[33:21] not a car
[33:24] what I'm trying to show you is
[33:27] these people didn't see the army
[33:32] these people never witness and say let's
[33:35] wait and check and see the Army before
[33:37] we start running away
[33:39] everybody okay the sound
[33:43] penetrate them
[33:45] you're following me when he penetrate to
[33:48] them he begin to create images
[33:55] are you with me let's preach like Sunday
[33:57] man
[33:59] everybody okay in other words when the
[34:02] Sun get there the Sun have something
[34:06] built in itself
[34:10] in other words God wants you to think
[34:14] about a car
[34:16] amen so for you to think about the car
[34:19] God must take the sound of a car and put
[34:24] it in your ear when you leave room
[34:27] what comes in your mind you see a car
[34:35] if they if God can make sound create
[34:39] images in you what can the devil do
[34:45] everybody okay if the if if if somebody
[34:48] wanna really get you in love
[34:54] they can play a sound
[34:56] amen and before you know it you will see
[34:59] somebody who's already thinking like
[35:01] they are in a restaurant and they are
[35:04] giving her a spoon and she's eating and
[35:08] she's but she's sitting home
[35:12] everybody okay
[35:14] do you see the danger of sand
[35:16] this is not word
[35:19] I'm not I'm not here this is not vocal
[35:21] amen the sound only has a message so God
[35:26] wanted those people to heal like a great
[35:30] armies coming with Chariot with horses
[35:33] and things like that God just took the
[35:36] sound and play with the sound and when
[35:39] God begin to play with the sand after a
[35:42] while they sat down they say wait a
[35:44] minute do You Hear What I Hear
[35:46] man wait a minute this this let's get
[35:49] out of here amen but there was nothing
[35:54] but the sand made a difference in their
[35:57] life
[35:58] the sun affected them the sun influenced
[36:01] them and the son put them in action
[36:05] believing exactly that what the sun say
[36:09] is the truth so the psalm carries a
[36:12] message
[36:14] [Music]
[36:16] everybody okay let me read it for the
[36:20] Lord has made the host of the Syrian to
[36:22] hear a noise of what Chariot and a noise
[36:27] of what
[36:28] even the noise of a great water and they
[36:31] said one to another low now they begin
[36:33] to interpret the king of water
[36:37] was the king of Israel there
[36:39] and has higher against us the king of
[36:42] water the height that and the king of
[36:44] water to come upon wherefore they arose
[36:48] and fled in the water do you see how
[36:51] much you can get in trouble
[36:54] because of the sound
[36:56] amen what I'm saying is most of our
[37:00] music are a combination of vocal with
[37:04] instrumental most of our music I like
[37:06] that amen when you listen to the vocal
[37:09] you will decode music
[37:11] you can say no this is not the message
[37:14] holy father I worship you Precious Jesus
[37:18] Holy Spirit saying that sounds like
[37:20] Trinity cut it off because you're
[37:22] getting divorced the vocal everybody
[37:25] okay but if they put to the instrumental
[37:28] this is where you don't get this is the
[37:30] power of rock and roll
[37:33] amen
[37:35] amen it is when they get in the
[37:37] instrument so you got music and music in
[37:41] one
[37:44] everybody clear everybody clear
[37:48] oh God help me let me see if I can find
[37:51] it Lord help me
[37:54] let's go to first king
[37:57] chapter one
[37:58] glory to God
[38:05] so when we are talking about your music
[38:07] is not good
[38:09] musician we're not talking about your
[38:12] words
[38:13] we know you already heard the word
[38:15] that's the reason why you say it's a
[38:17] Christian music the problem is not the
[38:19] word
[38:21] message believer argue all the time
[38:23] because all of them are arguing about
[38:25] the word
[38:26] you will hear people but that's exactly
[38:28] what some say
[38:30] they took the music from the book of
[38:32] Psalm and they sang it what is the
[38:34] problem because it's a Christian music
[38:36] and it's coming from the Bible that is
[38:38] the deception of the devil it is not the
[38:41] psalm that was taken out the psalm is
[38:43] coming from the Bible that's not the
[38:45] problem the reason why your soul is kind
[38:49] of fishy about it it is not really the
[38:52] sound it is this guy here that is
[38:55] holding another message
[38:58] and the Soul can pick up this one
[39:02] he'll say you know what
[39:05] maybe let's tune it down a little bit
[39:11] everybody okay
[39:13] first king chapter one
[39:16] verse 39 if you dare you can say Amen
[39:19] everybody okay
[39:22] all right and zadok the priest took a
[39:26] horn of oil out of the Tabernacle an
[39:29] anointed Solomon
[39:32] and they blew the trumpet
[39:34] and all the people say God save King
[39:38] Solomon
[39:40] watch now
[39:41] and all the people came up after him
[39:45] and the people did what
[39:47] pipe with water
[39:48] a celebration we got a new king now
[39:51] everybody's getting happy and when we
[39:54] got happy what do we do bring music
[39:58] amen that's the first thing where is
[40:01] that guitar bring it let's go ahead and
[40:03] rock the place
[40:05] everybody okay and the people piped with
[40:09] pipe and rejoice with great water
[40:12] so that the Earth
[40:19] the Earth did water
[40:22] ran with the
[40:25] so a sound can make the Earth even Shake
[40:31] I'm reading the Bible
[40:33] if the Earth can shake with this sound
[40:37] what about human being
[40:41] everybody okay music can make your heart
[40:44] go boom boom boom boom
[40:49] everybody okay the Influence of Music is
[40:53] even shaking the ground
[40:58] how can we shout and the ground begin to
[41:01] shake
[41:03] do you see now do you see now
[41:06] amen verse 41 and at the nature and all
[41:10] the guests that were with him heard it
[41:12] as they have made an end of eating and
[41:15] when johab
[41:17] heard of heard the sound of the trumpet
[41:20] he said wherefore is this noise of the
[41:24] city being in an apple in other words
[41:26] what is the meaning
[41:28] of the Sun because Paul said when a
[41:32] trumpet give an uncertain sign remember
[41:35] we must know what it is because the
[41:37] trumpet doesn't just blow they trumpet
[41:40] the sound of the trumpet is a message
[41:44] everybody okay so joab is like okay we
[41:47] hear the sound
[41:49] we need to decode
[41:51] because if you don't decode you don't
[41:54] know what is coming whether it's peace
[41:56] or you can get killed
[41:58] we okay
[42:00] job two verse uh
[42:02] 45.
[42:04] and zadok they begin to dig no let's go
[42:07] to 42 then 45. and while he yet speak
[42:10] behold Jonathan the son of abayator the
[42:13] priest came and I do not just say unto
[42:16] him come in for thou art of Iron Man and
[42:19] bring his good tithing in other words
[42:20] let us know the interpretation of it
[42:22] what is it what is the meaning
[42:25] verse 45. uh verse 45 and zedok the
[42:30] preached the net and the prophet have
[42:32] anointed him the giving them the
[42:34] interpretation have anointed him King in
[42:38] gajon and they are come up from their
[42:41] rejoicing so that the city wrong again
[42:45] disease the noise that she have heard in
[42:49] other words it was not just a noise he
[42:52] has a message what was the message
[42:54] Solomon became a king if you don't know
[42:58] that message you can get killed
[43:01] everybody okay so sounds are not sounds
[43:04] only sounds carries message
[43:09] everybody okay so our problem with the
[43:12] Christian music it is not really the
[43:15] lyrics
[43:18] it is not really the word
[43:21] amen because the word will say Lord Lord
[43:24] the word will say Jesus Christ the word
[43:28] will say Jehovah that's not the problem
[43:31] the danger of music is on the sound
[43:36] which sound the sounds that carry the
[43:39] word because the sand itself has a
[43:43] message
[43:44] amen and that's the message that will
[43:47] make you act Wild
[43:50] our God is an awesome God you will be
[43:54] sitting there now moving if I say our
[43:57] God is an awesome God who moved
[44:00] but there is a bit if I say our god this
[44:04] is an awesome God you won't sit that
[44:06] quiet some of you will have your head
[44:08] going this way
[44:10] amen what makes you move your head it is
[44:14] not the word
[44:16] everybody okay it is the message that is
[44:19] coming across the message say You must
[44:22] dance rap
[44:24] that's what we want you to do you must
[44:26] worship Jehovah in rap
[44:29] if you don't worship Him in rap that's
[44:32] not what we're talking about
[44:36] everybody okay
[44:38] let me read William Marion Branham
[44:41] because that make my life easy
[44:48] hey everybody okay
[44:51] in the message brother uh
[44:55] Caleb it's in 56 where you say rock and
[44:58] Boogie
[45:01] in a message making the valley full of
[45:04] dishes
[45:06] amen
[45:07] full of ditches brother Branham say this
[45:10] in paragraph 38. he says that is what
[45:14] America wants today
[45:16] Pentecost here it is get ready
[45:19] Pentecost is full of Hollywood
[45:23] evangelism
[45:27] amen they are preaching the gospel but
[45:31] in a Hollywood fashion
[45:33] everybody okay why in Louisville
[45:36] Kentucky a bunch of people coming there
[45:39] not long ago and I went over there to a
[45:43] Revival Center for to get my soul all
[45:47] fed up brother Branham was going there
[45:49] under expectation that oh there is a
[45:51] Revival let me go ahead and be partaker
[45:53] of the Revival so I'm gonna feed my soul
[45:55] with the things of God brother Branham
[45:58] say and I got over there I believe you
[46:00] got it and I got over there and a woman
[46:04] on the platform with great big water
[46:08] earrings hanging down
[46:12] do you see that on YouTube
[46:16] comma and with the clothes on
[46:20] look like she has been poor into them
[46:24] brother Branham is not describing the
[46:26] music yet
[46:29] everybody okay
[46:31] everybody okay because your Eternal
[46:34] destination remember
[46:36] depend on what you the discernment of
[46:38] what you see and what you you remember
[46:41] and remember God is not the author of
[46:45] confusion
[46:46] and the problem is we were in the age of
[46:49] lukewarmness so when you're trying to
[46:51] decode the music you gotta turn the
[46:53] volume down first because the volume
[46:56] will fool you when they say Lord Jesus I
[46:58] love you then you begin to get blinded
[47:00] turn Lord Jesus off take Jesus off first
[47:03] let's deal with the real thing what am I
[47:06] looking at this is what brother is
[47:08] saying I came in a Christian setting I'm
[47:11] expecting to see Christians what am I
[47:13] looking at first
[47:15] before we talk about music
[47:17] everybody okay
[47:19] everybody okay
[47:23] I got over there a woman on the platform
[47:26] with great big earring hanging down and
[47:29] with the clothes on look like she has
[47:31] been pouring to them in other words the
[47:33] clothes are so tight
[47:35] you wonder even how did they put that in
[47:40] everybody okay
[47:42] and the woman is running up and down the
[47:46] answer hollowing what devil
[47:51] what is she hollering
[47:56] you see the confusion
[47:58] somebody who looks sexy
[48:01] but yet I said wait a minute this is how
[48:05] can she dress like this then before you
[48:07] know it hallelujah hallelujah now it's a
[48:11] mixed message
[48:12] the dressing is wrong but it's coming
[48:15] with a Hallelujah
[48:17] this is where young people you open up
[48:19] you say wait a minute but she's saying
[48:20] hallelujah come on now
[48:22] cool down
[48:24] you're getting the Trap Of The Devil
[48:26] everybody okay he said Alleluia who will
[48:30] give the next 50.
[48:33] brother Brian I'm saying I never heard
[48:35] such
[48:37] and the music
[48:40] brother Branham is not talking about the
[48:43] lyrics of the music
[48:45] Amen brother Branham said the music
[48:48] sound you see where brother Branham is
[48:51] attacking the music
[48:53] not the word
[48:55] if he was satanic brother Branham is off
[48:58] Amen brother Branham said the music
[49:01] sound like some kind of water
[49:05] rock and roll that is not the word
[49:10] the rock and roll is on the Rhythm
[49:16] everybody okay
[49:18] that's what the prophet is pointing you
[49:20] need to be very careful when you read
[49:21] Bible he said it sounds like rock and
[49:24] roll Kama like Boogie Woogie
[49:27] Daddy's got its place
[49:32] brother Branham is not touching what is
[49:36] has been sung on the song that's not the
[49:39] problem of brother Branham because he
[49:41] knows that it must be Christian
[49:44] amen if it's the book of Psalm there is
[49:46] nothing you can do it is the word of God
[49:48] we got to say Amen but Brahma is
[49:50] catching the devil where he is in other
[49:52] words when brother Branham is coming he
[49:54] say I know you not here
[49:57] who's here
[50:00] rock and roll
[50:02] Boogie Woogie
[50:04] Amen brother Branham say rock and roll
[50:07] and Boogie Hoagie got its place
[50:11] in other words there are places that if
[50:13] you put your head and you see rock and
[50:16] roll we say yes you belong here
[50:19] everybody okay if you go somewhere else
[50:21] you find Boogie Woogie we say no problem
[50:23] this kind of environment yeah that's a
[50:26] perfect environment for Boogie Woogie
[50:27] but the problem is called in a church
[50:31] environment
[50:33] are we okay brother Brad I'm saying that
[50:36] that is garbage place but not on the
[50:39] water
[50:40] brother Branham didn't say that this
[50:43] woman should not sing Christian song on
[50:46] the platform
[50:47] brother Branham is saying that the sound
[50:49] that I'm hearing is the sound of rock
[50:52] and roll
[50:54] amen it is the sound of Boogie Woogie
[50:57] and brother Branham saying I got a coat
[50:59] that rock and roll is of the devil
[51:03] [Music]
[51:05] everybody okay so you cannot
[51:07] christianize rock and roll
[51:14] something can you take the devil and
[51:16] make him a Christian
[51:19] everybody okay the very origin of rock
[51:22] and roll is from hell that's what
[51:25] brother Branham said everybody okay so
[51:27] how can you take that one and make a
[51:30] Christian it will never happen
[51:33] because to begin with it comes from hell
[51:38] everybody okay
[51:40] brother Branham say but not on the
[51:44] platform amen I guess almost I thought
[51:47] the building might do what
[51:49] water
[51:53] yeah
[51:59] so in other words what you heard in the
[52:03] book of the king that was renting the
[52:05] floor

[52:10] can't say in this place before you know

[53:50] name
[53:51] but I'm going to have to call somebody's
[53:54] name now
[53:56] but I pray for the young man
[53:59] and I pray all the time for him
[54:02] but he is an instrument in the hands of
[54:06] the devil
[54:09] amen amen
[54:11] everybody okay
[54:13] you know when we talk about
[54:15] Elvis Presley like this you are looking
[54:18] at the Elvis Presley on TV
[54:21] Elvis Presley was double
[54:25] amen Elvis Presley was singing worldly
[54:29] music
[54:30] and he was also singing Christian music
[54:34] that one you don't know most of you
[54:36] don't know you only know Elvis Presley
[54:37] on the crazy TV
[54:40] brother Branham is not talking about
[54:42] Elvis Presley on the concert
[54:45] he's talking about Elvis Presley in a
[54:48] different level
[54:49] listen to brother Brown brother brother
[54:51] I'm saying and that is this man Elvis
[54:54] Presley
[54:55] watch where brother Branham is holding
[54:59] Elvis Presley not in his Christian song
[55:02] watch where he's getting it he says the
[55:06] people are gone you got it on the puppet
[55:09] on the screen he says the people are
[55:12] gone Boogie Woogie again you see where
[55:14] brother Branham is holding it
[55:21] people has gone and they are trying
[55:26] by that same spirit
[55:29] amen to get the thing into the church
[55:35] not the song
[55:37] I don't know if you're getting me not
[55:40] the lyrics
[55:41] the lyrics is Christian the problem is
[55:44] the Rhythm they are bringing into the
[55:47] church that's what brother Branham has a
[55:50] problem with it
[55:52] everybody okay brother Branham continue
[55:55] he say I like church music play like
[55:59] what
[56:00] church music and not water
[56:04] in their Church
[56:06] so the problem is the beat
[56:10] the problem is the Rhythm
[56:14] take the Christian song you wanted but
[56:17] choose the appropriate Rhythm that you
[56:20] can play with it because the Rhythm
[56:23] itself separately already got a message
[56:26] loaded
[56:28] and that's the message that will get
[56:30] into the people unconsciously just the
[56:34] same way God I mean the devil sealed the
[56:37] message that's the way he get into you
[56:40] unconsciously
[56:42] before you know it you begin to feel
[56:45] strange things in your body and you
[56:47] don't know how you're feeling such thing
[56:48] it is that beat that was working there
[56:51] was playing with your hormone
[56:56] everybody okay
[56:57] brother brought them say but when they
[57:00] get this Spirit there is something
[57:02] behind this and the devil put itself out
[57:06] a challenge and it happened to be that
[57:08] this poor box leading Pentecostal boy
[57:12] say that they that say the way he
[57:16] learned his maneuver of jerking and
[57:19] shaking he caught it and learned it in
[57:23] the
[57:26] Elvis Presley didn't learn it in the
[57:29] nightclub
[57:31] how did he get into the church
[57:34] he is a member of the First Assembly of
[57:36] God and Memphis everybody okay Tennessee
[57:39] his Pastor is a friend of mine everybody
[57:43] okay
[57:44] let me go to this one and then we
[57:46] continue oh my
[57:49] let's go to the message thirst
[57:54] oh my God
[57:56] glory to God
[57:58] everybody okay I hope I'm not killing
[58:01] your favorite but if I kill him that's
[58:04] very good

[58:21] about all this carrying on

[58:48] stuff look at this Elvis Presley you see
[58:51] where it's coming from
[58:52] a devil standing in shoes
[58:56] I'm reading brother Branham he called
[58:59] bread of expressly a devil standing in
[59:01] his shoes amen

[59:07] him into Jay-Z whoever you call it
[59:10] Beyonce you can put them all together
[59:12] amen
[59:19] okay
[59:22] the biggest indictment this nation has
[59:25] ever had that is right watch the
[59:28] your trouble they say oh
[59:33] they are very
[59:36] Elvis Presley that you know in the world
[59:39] sometime he was religious
[59:44] brother Branham say they are very
[59:46] religious Karma they sang
[59:51] ah
[59:53] they sang water
[59:55] why are worldly musicians singing
[59:59] Christian song
[1:00:02] amen
[1:00:03] why are they singing Christian song
[1:00:06] amen the song is good when it's written
[1:00:10] but what they're changing is the Rhythm
[1:00:13] Amen brother Branham said they are
[1:00:16] singing the sun Christian song they
[1:00:19] ought not
[1:00:20] in other words you should not even touch
[1:00:22] Christian song
[1:00:24] but because of the age that we're living
[1:00:27] in the age is giving them permission
[1:00:32] they have permission by prophecy that
[1:00:35] they can mix the things of God and the
[1:00:37] things from the Devil
[1:00:40] everybody okay
[1:00:42] brother Branham continue he says the
[1:00:45] church ought not to even permit a thing
[1:00:48] like that
[1:00:51] some of these guys go out here tonight
[1:00:53] they are on the Roadhouse out here
[1:00:56] dancing and playing music and everything
[1:00:59] that music they're playing is worldly
[1:01:03] that's on Saturday night on Sunday
[1:01:05] morning day on the night they they're in
[1:01:07] church that's the problem with this guy
[1:01:09] so when you talk to somebody no he's a
[1:01:12] Christian we know the faith of Beyonce
[1:01:14] we know the pastor of Beyonce good luck
[1:01:19] everybody okay he says that and the next
[1:01:23] night they come to the Altar and do what
[1:01:26] weep
[1:01:27] and the next night they are playing
[1:01:30] music on the what platform oh goodness
[1:01:33] gracious how far can filth how far could
[1:01:38] fifth go anywhere anyhow yes sir prove
[1:01:42] himself how
[1:01:44] first to be a water a man of God not all
[1:01:48] these are not all this stuff just
[1:01:50] because he can beat a not guitar or what
[1:01:55] what brother Branham is saying is when
[1:01:59] you get a musician converted
[1:02:02] push the brick on him
[1:02:05] don't give him an instrument in the
[1:02:07] church
[1:02:07] he still wired with stuff that is coming
[1:02:10] up from there don't let him play in the
[1:02:12] church as much as he's gifted in the
[1:02:15] piano please don't bother Brother John
[1:02:17] [Music]
[1:02:19] let him sit down
[1:02:21] let him prove to us that he changed
[1:02:25] first because if he get on the piano
[1:02:28] here
[1:02:32] your hip will move from here it's going
[1:02:34] to go on the side over there
[1:02:40] it is not his song that move your hip
[1:02:43] it is his beat he knows which bit to
[1:02:47] beat
[1:02:48] and then every woman on the nightclub
[1:02:51] will go a certain way that's what he's
[1:02:53] gonna do here
[1:02:57] receiving
[1:03:02] you should have used a white background
[1:03:04] probably
[1:03:06] first uh 65. brother Branham say a
[1:03:09] fellow called me say come here preacher
[1:03:12] come on down here a minute I want you to
[1:03:15] see a television program
[1:03:17] and there was one of a great
[1:03:18] denomination in the church had some of
[1:03:21] these things cover over my that was not
[1:03:24] a Catholic Church this was Protestant
[1:03:27] church
[1:03:29] cover over the thing and was practicing
[1:03:32] this rock and roll
[1:03:34] the beat and they said
[1:03:37] and they say that long has the church
[1:03:40] Forsaken and overlooked the beautiful
[1:03:43] art of reckon roll if that ain't a
[1:03:47] perverted spirit I don't know what it is
[1:03:49] brother Branham rock and roll is of the
[1:03:53] devil
[1:03:56] everybody okay I don't care how many
[1:04:00] religious song
[1:04:02] people I have the some of you have it
[1:04:05] you can verify with me but when I'm
[1:04:08] saying I don't care how many religious
[1:04:11] song people can sing
[1:04:13] rock and roll and Boogie woogly and that
[1:04:18] kind of stuff come out of the Jungle of
[1:04:22] Africa that is exactly right it is the
[1:04:26] devil
[1:04:31] everybody okay
[1:04:32] brother Branham say I don't care how
[1:04:35] many religious song they sing so the
[1:04:38] problem is not the lyric of the song the
[1:04:41] problem is the rhythm of the song the
[1:04:45] beat of the song the genre of the song
[1:04:47] the type of the song that is where you
[1:04:50] get the trouble that's where the devil
[1:04:52] entering that's the one that will make
[1:04:55] you act any kind of way
[1:04:57] so when you fasting don't fuss about it
[1:05:01] oh
[1:05:02] brother Stephen he's a he's a Christian
[1:05:04] singer that's not my problem what is the
[1:05:07] Rhythm he's using to bring his message
[1:05:09] because the Rhythm itself got a message
[1:05:13] in itself amen you asked people that
[1:05:16] went to rock and roll World they would
[1:05:18] take their music the music will play a
[1:05:21] certain music and when they stop the
[1:05:23] music you know that you take a CD you
[1:05:26] move it on the reverse it will play a
[1:05:28] satanic worship on the same CD
[1:05:34] if you don't know that go search it
[1:05:36] amen the same the same city if you put
[1:05:40] the CD your way it will tell you a
[1:05:43] secular music but if you go on a reverse
[1:05:45] it's a different thing
[1:05:51] everybody okay
[1:05:52] everybody good
[1:05:54] all right now part six point six
[1:05:59] it's the theme of the music
[1:06:04] amen what is the theme of the music
[1:06:09] amen who are you singing the music to
[1:06:12] let's go to Psalm 45.
[1:06:24] part three
[1:06:32] Psalm 45 if you dare you can say Amen
[1:06:37] Glory Glory Hallelujah sincerely my
[1:06:41] burden down
[1:06:46] verse one
[1:06:48] Hallelujah the Bible says
[1:06:52] to the chief musician upon social name
[1:06:55] for the sons of Korah mascule a song of
[1:06:59] water
[1:07:01] a song of loves which love
[1:07:05] between you and your wife
[1:07:09] you see what is going on
[1:07:11] amen
[1:07:12] my heart is endearing a good mother
[1:07:17] is filled with good man
[1:07:20] I speak of the things everybody okay
[1:07:23] which I have made my inspiration that I
[1:07:26] have made touching who
[1:07:29] so the one David is singing to is not
[1:07:33] his wife
[1:07:35] David is not there singing oh my
[1:07:38] beautiful wife that's not what he's
[1:07:40] singing It's a song of love but not a
[1:07:44] song of love to his wife
[1:07:46] a song of Love To The King
[1:07:48] everybody okay
[1:07:49] I'm singing I'm touching the king my
[1:07:53] tongue is a pen of a ready Rudder
[1:07:56] everybody okay so the theme of David's
[1:07:59] song are directed toward God
[1:08:05] when you hear a song who are they
[1:08:08] singing to
[1:08:10] they say it's a Christian song who are
[1:08:13] they singing to why do they have to
[1:08:15] quote people name
[1:08:19] the god of so and so the god of so and
[1:08:22] so who taught you God is his God
[1:08:27] you hear that even among message
[1:08:28] believer the god of Pastor so-and-so the
[1:08:31] god of oh okay if tomorrow that Pastor
[1:08:34] backslid what are you gonna do
[1:08:37] thank you
[1:08:39] where do you get that
[1:08:43] let's go to Psalm 149
[1:08:46] .
[1:08:47] let's see the theme of our song
[1:08:53] amen
[1:08:56] amen who are we singing our song to
[1:09:01] amen
[1:09:03] Psalm 49 if you dare you can say Amen
[1:09:07] verse 1.
[1:09:08] amen
[1:09:11] the Bible say praise you
[1:09:17] few people some are still moving there
[1:09:21] 149 I'm sorry 149 my
[1:09:25] fault apology
[1:09:29] 149.
[1:09:30] amen
[1:09:32] verse 1 praise you
[1:09:35] the Lord sing unto who
[1:09:39] so everything is unto God
[1:09:43] everybody okay the theme of a Christian
[1:09:46] song should be directed toward God
[1:09:51] nobody else
[1:09:56] everybody okay
[1:09:58] I can even shock you not even brother
[1:10:01] Branham
[1:10:06] everybody okay not even brother Branham
[1:10:13] praise ye the Lord sing unto the Lord a
[1:10:17] water
[1:10:19] we can get to that and his praise in the
[1:10:22] congregation of the saint so the theme
[1:10:26] of the song goes only to the Lord
[1:10:29] because when it's not directed to the
[1:10:32] Lord he brings trouble
[1:10:39] brother Stephen you say when it's not
[1:10:41] directed to the Lord he brings trouble
[1:10:43] let's go to First Samuel chapter 18.
[1:10:45] let's see another song

[1:10:52] another song

[1:16:13] and Saul was very
[1:16:18] let me ask you a question when the women
[1:16:21] were coming they were coming to a
[1:16:25] welcome home
[1:16:26] King who
[1:16:28] King Saul but why is Saul angry

[1:16:41] of the song

[1:16:54] towards celebrities
[1:16:56] it is no longer directed toward God the
[1:17:00] theme have changed now you open the door
[1:17:03] to a spirit

[1:17:12] they have ascribed unto David ten
[1:17:15] thousand and to me they have ascribed by
[1:17:18] the thousand and what can he more

[1:17:33] his song

[1:17:38] a song from the women
[1:17:41] because the theme of the song was not
[1:17:44] directed unto God
[1:17:46] the theme of the song was directed unto
[1:17:49] the people he opened the door to
[1:17:52] jealousy and a brother suffered the rest
[1:17:54] of his life until so was there even

[1:36:54] instrument of music and praise who

[1:38:43] the presence of who
[1:38:46] it is a law
[1:38:50] it is a law when you stop praising him
[1:38:53] you are actually building a throne
[1:38:57] of praise and once that Throne is well
[1:39:01] established then God will always inhabit
[1:39:04] the Praises of his people

[1:39:31] came in this case they were dedicating
[1:39:34] the temple he filled the temple in the
[1:39:36] case of Paul they're looking for

[1:40:19] tears come running down I like that that
[1:40:23] was the the title of the song the tears

[1:43:10] they start with wings you jump on it
[1:43:12] drinking strawberry lemonade now you're
[1:43:15] in trouble
[1:43:18] second Chronicle chapter 20 is a sense
[1:43:21] of humor verse 20. if you're there you
[1:43:24] can say Amen and there was early in the
[1:43:27] morning and went forth Into the
[1:43:29] Wilderness of tecoya you know the Battle
[1:43:30] of Jehoshaphat and as they went forth
[1:43:33] Jehoshaphat stood and say Hear Me O
[1:43:37] Israel and ye inhabitant of Jerusalem
[1:43:40] believe on the Lord your God so shall ye
[1:43:45] be established believe in his Prophet so
[1:43:48] shall he Prosper watch now the order you
[1:43:51] there
[1:43:52] and when he had consulted with the
[1:43:54] people he appointed who
[1:43:57] singers unto the
[1:43:59] we must keep the theme correct Kama that
[1:44:03] should praise the beauty of Holiness as
[1:44:07] they went out before the
[1:44:11] please how can you go with an army with
[1:44:15] singer before
[1:44:18] because the first one they're gonna get
[1:44:19] the bullet are singers
[1:44:26] that's why musician
[1:44:29] when we have service the devil will
[1:44:32] first start shooting at you
[1:44:34] need to stay consecrated
[1:44:37] if we got service tomorrow morning
[1:44:39] spend some time praying if you're gonna
[1:44:42] play the piano if you're going to be the
[1:44:44] song leader if you're going to touch an
[1:44:45] instrument if you're going to be a
[1:44:47] backup singer watch out what you're
[1:44:48] doing because bullets are flying they
[1:44:51] already put you first
[1:44:53] everybody okay so the order of the
[1:44:56] church a start with musician
[1:45:01] that's why when we start service who
[1:45:05] stand here brother John or brother set
[1:45:08] stand here because that is the order
[1:45:12] the biblical order of the fight we're
[1:45:15] starting a fight in other words when
[1:45:17] brother John stand here and say I hear
[1:45:20] the Lord just know the fight Heaven is
[1:45:22] on
[1:45:22] come on
[1:45:25] just now we already started
[1:45:28] the world started amen the singers are
[1:45:32] placed first and then be what follow
[1:45:35] it's the army
[1:45:39] the Bible says that when they did that
[1:45:42] and to say praise the Lord for his Mercy
[1:45:45] endures forever so when the enemy begin
[1:45:49] to look at the camp of Israel
[1:45:52] they say oh they're coming and everybody
[1:45:54] set up for the battle but as they coming
[1:45:57] they look coming up the hill they
[1:46:00] probably were looking at the general or
[1:46:02] job or whoever the general was was
[1:46:05] coming on the horse coming up and say
[1:46:07] but for that place they begin to see
[1:46:10] people singing Hallelujah Hallelujah
[1:46:15] really you're kidding me singers
[1:46:21] what does that do what is disorder what
[1:46:24] is the power behind this order
[1:46:26] verse 22 and when they begin to fight
[1:46:35] okay when they begin to sing and to do
[1:46:38] what praise
[1:46:40] the Lord set a water
[1:46:44] the Lord didn't set ambushment until the
[1:46:48] song goes up because the Lord we just
[1:46:51] seen is God inhabit water so as soon as
[1:46:55] we start music God is on the sin
[1:47:00] nobody even fought this battle
[1:47:02] amen because they invited God Amen the
[1:47:06] Bible says and the Lord set ambushment
[1:47:08] against the children of Ammon Moab and
[1:47:12] monster which were come against Judah
[1:47:14] and they were water
[1:47:16] they begin to kill each other
[1:47:21] so the army that look weak was really
[1:47:24] very powerful the musician office that
[1:47:28] people usually see around the message
[1:47:30] like they just singer we waiting for the
[1:47:33] word you don't know how powerful the
[1:47:36] song Services
[1:47:38] you who are not here who may be one day
[1:47:42] if the Lord direct me to release this
[1:47:44] step you who always come late
[1:47:48] you who always miss the service the song
[1:47:52] service you who don't see the importance
[1:47:55] of the song service even if you live
[1:47:57] next to this church here you will be
[1:47:59] late
[1:48:02] amen amen you don't see the importance
[1:48:07] of the song service I will come there
[1:48:09] when brother John is just about to be
[1:48:10] done oh brother cities are just about to
[1:48:13] be done when I get there we're looking
[1:48:14] for the word brother we're looking for
[1:48:16] the word
[1:48:18] who put the song
[1:48:23] amen who put the song brother Branham
[1:48:25] say singing is preaching the gospel
[1:48:31] so your word is only coming for the
[1:48:33] preacher not from the singer you who
[1:48:35] don't value the importance of song
[1:48:39] service song service itself can give you
[1:48:42] an answer to your problem before even I
[1:48:45] stand here on the pope song service can
[1:48:47] heal you because God heals by music
[1:48:56] just in the song service you get it
[1:48:59] they didn't say call someone to come and
[1:49:01] to begin to preach to Saul they call a
[1:49:04] musician to heal him
[1:49:07] okay the order is right here it is a
[1:49:11] very important and a powerful weapon
[1:49:13] that the people don't understand in the
[1:49:16] message and neglecting this office oh no
[1:49:19] uh we just singing I'm not a preacher
[1:49:21] why should I even worry to be uh praying
[1:49:24] 30 minutes before tomorrow no I pray

[2:05:59] we know that David was a musician too
[2:06:01] right
[2:06:02] but David was not delivered but
[2:06:05] everybody okay
[2:06:07] but David opened another priesthood
[2:06:10] where he can get in the temple and eat
[2:06:12] bread and nothing happened to him
[2:06:15] because he was coming from the tribe of
[2:06:17] Judah he was talking about another
[2:06:19] priesthood
[2:06:21] which was Melchizedek so if the
[2:06:23] levitical priesthood produced singer the

[2:08:04] you know that right you know where it is
[2:08:06] right in the Book of Revelation chapter
[2:08:08] 19 right the Bible say for the final
[2:08:11] Anem is the water
[2:08:13] the righteousness of the
[2:08:16] question your clothing

[2:08:23] Wednesday as a musician as a backup
[2:08:27] singer as a song leader as a one who's

[2:08:48] about the righteousness of God another
[2:08:51] word a musician clothing a musician
[2:08:55] either apparel must reflect
[2:08:59] the righteousness of God when people

[2:12:54] brother Branham you can mix what
[2:12:57] with what laudisha
[2:13:02] everybody okay everybody good everybody

[2:13:08] praise God what are you trying to say
[2:13:11] the priesthood
[2:13:13] of the old Leviticus produces musician
[2:13:17] let's go to First Peter 2. let's look at
[2:13:20] the Melchizedek priesthood did he
[2:13:23] produce
[2:13:24] musician
[2:13:27] did you produce somebody
[2:13:31] first Peter I'm almost done
[2:13:35] so don't bear with me so we can get it
[2:13:38] now
[2:13:40] first Peter
[2:13:42] chapter 2 verse 9.
[2:13:44] if you dare you can say Amen very
[2:13:46] familiar scripture
[2:13:48] everybody okay
[2:13:50] but ye are a chosen what
[2:13:54] I talked about this before right
[2:13:56] a royal water
[2:13:59] a holy water
[2:14:01] A peculiar water you see how God is
[2:14:04] separating you
[2:14:06] why that he should show forth the
[2:14:11] of him who has called you Adolf into His
[2:14:16] Marvelous so when they see you they must
[2:14:20] see somebody who has been changed
[2:14:24] they must see somebody who has been
[2:14:26] transformed
[2:14:27] they must look at someone that is
[2:14:30] reflecting a Christian that they look
[2:14:33] they say okay so when God Save Somebody
[2:14:35] this is how he looks but today if you
[2:14:39] look at nowadays clip on YouTube of
[2:14:43] musician you look at them singing for
[2:14:46] God and you look at the one on the
[2:14:49] street both of them look the same
[2:14:52] tight dresses big earring banging and
[2:14:55] all kind of stuff tattoo everywhere they
[2:14:58] look the same
[2:14:59] they cannot reflect that this is the
[2:15:03] light this is Darkness they both reflect
[2:15:05] the darkness under the song Under the
[2:15:08] pretest of singing for the king
[2:15:10] everybody okay let's go to Hebrew 13.
[2:15:15] verse 15.
[2:15:19] amen
[2:15:21] almost done buddy almost done Hebrew 13
[2:15:26] Hebrew 13 he almost said the Finishing
[2:15:28] Line Hebrew 13 verse 15. amen
[2:15:33] by him therefore let us do what
[2:15:37] offer the sacrifice of what
[2:15:41] to who
[2:15:42] the proper theme
[2:15:45] continually that is the fruit of our
[2:15:49] giving thanks to his
[2:15:54] that's the purpose God Made You
[2:15:56] everybody okay everybody good
[2:16:00] so what are you pointing about musician
[2:16:03] what are you really talking about let's
[2:16:06] go to First Samuel chapter 16 then we
[2:16:09] nail it there
[2:16:12] follow me carefully
[2:16:14] and we nail this point
[2:16:16] first Samuel chapter 16.
[2:16:20] before I go there I'm gonna remind you
[2:16:24] that musician
[2:16:26] you can be born
[2:16:29] or you can be taught
[2:16:33] everybody okay I got caught
[2:16:36] there is somebody they don't teach you
[2:16:38] music
[2:16:39] they just pick up the instrument they
[2:16:40] can play brother Brown I'm talking about
[2:16:42] it
[2:16:42] some of your birth coming from maybe a
[2:16:45] gift in the family comes from a mother
[2:16:46] or somebody and you pick it up everybody
[2:16:48] okay but some you probably don't know
[2:16:51] you were not born you sit there they
[2:16:53] teach you and before you know it you
[2:16:54] begin to play an instrument but there is
[2:16:56] somebody
[2:16:57] that before they teach him you can tell
[2:16:59] when they teach him he's now a maestro
[2:17:02] everybody okay so what I'm trying to say
[2:17:05] here everybody okay this one you can
[2:17:08] build you can learn
[2:17:10] but this one is very dangerous
[2:17:15] everybody okay why because gifts
[2:17:21] and water
[2:17:23] ah what
[2:17:25] so before you even come to the Lord your
[2:17:28] voice was already beautiful
[2:17:33] so don't think when you got sin your
[2:17:35] voice will change a Pentecostal
[2:17:38] understanding
[2:17:41] don't think if you go to the nightclub
[2:17:43] you come tomorrow then the voice will be
[2:17:45] no it will even go very good
[2:17:49] after you slept with a woman
[2:17:54] because gift and calling are without
[2:17:57] water
[2:17:58] it won't come off you will go to hell
[2:18:01] with it
[2:18:04] the hell he'll fill with people with
[2:18:06] beautiful voices
[2:18:08] the hell is filled with American adults
[2:18:11] people that sing and everybody put ten
[2:18:13] ten ten ten ten ten ten they inhale
[2:18:16] Michael Jackson and the other one the
[2:18:18] Elvis Presley all of them you're going
[2:18:19] to see them there
[2:18:22] everybody okay everybody okay
[2:18:26] because gift and calling are what with
[2:18:28] our repentance amen
[2:18:31] why are you studying here
[2:18:34] because this is the danger of musician
[2:18:38] first Samuel chapter 16 if you dare you
[2:18:41] can say Amen verse 12. you there
[2:18:46] you know this story
[2:18:47] descend forth to anoint a King David I
[2:18:51] know you know the story but I want you
[2:18:54] to follow me even though you know the
[2:18:55] story
[2:18:56] you okay
[2:18:58] the Bible says in verse 12 and he sent
[2:19:01] and brought him in they brought David
[2:19:04] now he wants to rooted
[2:19:06] and without of all beautiful continents
[2:19:09] and goodly to look to
[2:19:12] and the Lord say
[2:19:14] eras and anoint him for this is he
[2:19:20] the first time David appeared on the
[2:19:24] Bible
[2:19:25] amen the first time David is making his
[2:19:28] appearance because God said go to the
[2:19:31] house of Jesse I have somebody there
[2:19:33] Samuel said if I go Saul heard he's
[2:19:35] going to kill me he said no go ahead and
[2:19:37] organize a Revival and invite Jesse by
[2:19:40] the time he get there with his truck
[2:19:42] with his van and his children you bring
[2:19:44] them there one of them you're gonna
[2:19:46] anoint him David God they got there and
[2:19:49] Samuel began to preach preach preach
[2:19:51] preach the anointing came he felt the
[2:19:53] anointing he said Jesse come here with
[2:19:55] your children oh Jesse begin to line
[2:19:57] them up
[2:19:58] God God said
[2:20:00] the anointing left he said father this
[2:20:03] one said save me send me I'm looking
[2:20:06] down there
[2:20:07] I'm not over there okay first out second
[2:20:09] hand third down but God he told me Jesse
[2:20:13] Jesse is here say wait a minute you have
[2:20:15] one more
[2:20:17] uh uh he was supposed to cut the grass
[2:20:21] somewhere
[2:20:24] everybody okay I'm just actualizing okay
[2:20:27] they say go get him why did you left him
[2:20:30] we fixed such a big convention like this
[2:20:32] go get him you see how God can organize
[2:20:34] a whole meeting for one person
[2:20:37] for just one person
[2:20:39] and everybody fell in the church but
[2:20:41] it's for one person
[2:20:42] everybody okay okay they brought David
[2:20:45] in as David is coming boom ah the
[2:20:47] anointing struck the men he said oh
[2:20:50] that's him amen so the first entrance of
[2:20:54] David in the scripture amen has nothing
[2:20:58] to do with his gift
[2:21:04] the first description of David in the
[2:21:08] scripture is not about his gift
[2:21:11] is not a bad being musician
[2:21:15] it's about bringing first
[2:21:18] the spirit of God in his life
[2:21:23] I don't know if you're getting me a
[2:21:25] musician
[2:21:27] verse 12 13 amen
[2:21:31] then Samuel took the Horn of oil and
[2:21:34] anointed him in the midst of his
[2:21:37] Brethren and the water
[2:21:39] the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David
[2:21:42] from that day forward so Samuel rose up
[2:21:48] and went to water the first thing as
[2:21:51] soon as David arises on the sin God
[2:21:55] bring his Spirit down and the Bible said
[2:21:57] when the spirit came down on David he
[2:22:00] doesn't leave the boy
[2:22:02] why A Gifted boy should need a spirit
[2:22:09] we okay now
[2:22:10] job to verse 18 if you dare
[2:22:15] matter of fact let's keep there let's go
[2:22:17] to verse 14 but the spirit of the Lord
[2:22:21] departed from Saul
[2:22:23] and an evil spirit from the Lord
[2:22:25] troubled him
[2:22:27] everybody okay
[2:22:29] now a case open up
[2:22:31] this case did not open until David came
[2:22:36] on the scene the case opened up
[2:22:39] and Saul's servants say unto him behold
[2:22:43] now an evil spirit from God's troubled
[2:22:49] what I'm trying to say is
[2:22:52] Saul lost the anointing a bad Spirit
[2:22:56] entered him
[2:22:58] now they need a solution for him amen
[2:23:02] but they are calling for a solution
[2:23:05] then the solution is coming after the
[2:23:08] anointing
[2:23:11] not before the anointing
[2:23:14] are we okay verses 16 let our Lord Now
[2:23:19] command that servant which are before
[2:23:22] thee to seek out a man who is how
[2:23:27] coming player on water we need a
[2:23:31] musician
[2:23:32] we need a Gifted Man
[2:23:35] that gift that you were born with that
[2:23:38] is without repentance now is called on
[2:23:41] the sin
[2:23:42] they want to use it
[2:23:44] [Music]
[2:23:45] everybody okay
[2:23:47] when any shall come to pass when the
[2:23:51] evil spirit
[2:23:52] from God is upon thee that he shall play
[2:23:56] with his hand and that shall be well the
[2:24:01] requirement here is to fund a musician
[2:24:05] according to these people if the
[2:24:07] musician come and begin to play
[2:24:10] saw somehow will get deliveries amen so
[2:24:15] the requirement is only to find a
[2:24:17] musician was David the only musician
[2:24:20] he was not the only musician we got
[2:24:23] musician there now these people were
[2:24:25] sent to pick the musician what is the
[2:24:28] qualification they are picking up the
[2:24:30] musician
[2:24:32] you there and Saul say unto the servant
[2:24:36] verse 17 provide me a man that can play
[2:24:39] well and bring him to me are you there
[2:24:43] then answer one of the servants and say
[2:24:47] behold I have seen a son of Jesse the
[2:24:52] Bethlehem
[2:24:54] that is a coming in player so he already
[2:24:58] fulfilled the requirement we send him
[2:25:01] when you pass through the road there you
[2:25:04] will hear somebody really playing the
[2:25:07] guitar left and right you say who is
[2:25:09] that boy over there they say oh that's
[2:25:11] the son of JC you know that boy man he
[2:25:14] was born with that boy can really play
[2:25:16] the guitar

[2:25:23] playing the guitar if you pass they say
[2:25:24] that's David that's his talent we
[2:25:27] already know watch verses 18. then

[2:26:10] it is not just about playing music about
[2:26:13] playing music the boy knows how to play
[2:26:15] music but the reason why I'm suggesting
[2:26:18] this boy is because this boy is more
[2:26:21] than a musician
[2:26:23] everybody okay this boy not only is he a
[2:26:27] musician he's a good boy this boy is
[2:26:30] prudent in manners in matters and not
[2:26:33] only that the highest thing is when you

[2:26:38] you will sense the spirit of God
[2:26:45] amen what are you trying to say by that
[2:26:49] job to verse 23.
[2:26:52] and he come to pass when the evil spirit
[2:26:56] from God was uponso that David took a
[2:26:59] harp and played with his hand so Saul
[2:27:02] was what
[2:27:03] and was well and the evil spirit did
[2:27:06] water
[2:27:07] war was chasing the demon out
[2:27:12] amen

[2:27:18] David entered into function
[2:27:21] when this after the spirit of the Lord
[2:27:25] came upon him
[2:27:27] he was not just a singing he was an
[2:27:31] anointed singer
[2:27:34] what are you trying to say even though

[2:27:41] even though you are born as a musician
[2:27:44] even though you have been taught
[2:27:46] musician from your home or from somebody

[2:27:53] end of it my brother you still open to
[2:27:55] the devil

[2:28:03] best that you can to make sure you got
[2:28:05] the Holy Ghost
[2:28:10] amen
[2:28:12] William Marion Branham let me nail by

[2:28:20] see if I can get this right here glory
[2:28:23] to God
[2:28:24] in a church order
[2:28:27] where he said the one playing with the
[2:28:30] instrument

[2:29:00] amen
[2:29:01] the Branham Tabernacle at what
[2:29:07] somebody's tired
[2:29:10] the brother because sometimes
[2:29:17] can I hear it
[2:29:19] the Branham Tabernacle
[2:29:22] at all time
[2:29:26] should
[2:29:28] have
[2:29:30] air spirit filled water
[2:29:36] who would come how
[2:29:38] fill with the water
[2:29:41] and would play how
[2:29:43] very
[2:29:45] and what kind of music
[2:29:47] such as Dan at the cross where my savior
[2:29:53] die
[2:29:55] down there for clean sing from sin a
[2:30:00] crime
[2:30:01] dare to my heart was the blood I
[2:30:06] applying
[2:30:07] glory to his name something on that
[2:30:12] order near my cross today Rock of Ages
[2:30:17] cleft for me or near The Cross or
[2:30:20] something on that
[2:30:22] softly slowly as he's doing water
[2:30:27] constantly on the water
[2:30:29] he or
[2:30:31] whichever it may
[2:30:39] a musician should be
[2:30:42] having the spirit of God
[2:30:46] amen if you don't have the Holy Ghost
[2:30:51] you need to cry out and you need to
[2:30:54] guard yourself because you can easily by
[2:30:58] your gift
[2:30:59] can be pushed one way to the other in
[2:31:03] other words the level of a consecration
[2:31:07] of a musician will bleed through
[2:31:10] everything that you do
[2:31:15] that's the message amen your level of
[2:31:18] consecration your attachment to the word
[2:31:21] your level if you are on ten everything
[2:31:25] you do for music will be ten if you want
[2:31:28] to everything you do for music will be
[2:31:31] two because your level is low
[2:31:35] amen
[2:31:39] amen everybody okay if not you're gonna
[2:31:42] sing empty songs
[2:31:44] if not you're gonna do things that you
[2:31:47] don't even know what to do should we
[2:31:49] sing new song yes
[2:31:51] the Bible says Sing a new song there's
[2:31:54] nothing wrong with a new song the
[2:31:56] problem is what is the instrumental of
[2:31:59] your new song
[2:32:01] if it's a new song
[2:32:04] and the lyric are according to the word
[2:32:07] we already went through that if the
[2:32:09] lyric are according to the word and the
[2:32:12] beat of your music The Rhythm is correct
[2:32:16] it is not reflecting loudisha then the
[2:32:19] new song is normal there's nothing wrong
[2:32:22] with your new song
[2:32:24] everybody okay but as the age is
[2:32:26] continuing to go through Darkness very
[2:32:29] few songs
[2:32:31] very qualified good song are coming up
[2:32:34] from the Pentecostal Realm I'm not
[2:32:37] saying they won't come out because gift
[2:32:39] and calling are without water but they
[2:32:42] will blend it in the way of audition and
[2:32:45] you will bring devil on you especially
[2:32:47] if you don't have the Holy Ghost
[2:32:50] when you don't have the Holy Ghost
[2:32:52] that's when you suck every song and when
[2:32:55] you sucking you sucking even their
[2:32:57] Spirit remember you get into an
[2:33:00] environment you're gonna pick up that
[2:33:01] Spirit you put your head into an
[2:33:03] environment you're picking up that
[2:33:05] Spirit that's why you watch a singer you
[2:33:08] will see their dressing and everything
[2:33:11] how it's changing most of their weight
[2:33:15] they dress go check exactly what kind of
[2:33:19] music they're listening to you what kind
[2:33:22] of clip they're watching that's exactly
[2:33:24] what has been bleeding into their life
[2:33:27] because the holy spirit is not there to
[2:33:30] guide you to give you a sense like no
[2:33:33] don't get this one this is not correct
[2:33:35] you are sucking everything and those
[2:33:38] music once they get into you before you
[2:33:40] know it you will change your way of
[2:33:42] dressing you will change your way of
[2:33:44] Behaving you might even change your
[2:33:46] temper
[2:33:49] you will change your behavior
[2:33:51] you will become stubborn all of that is
[2:33:55] coming from the music you pumping the
[2:33:57] music I'm talking about is not Lord Lord
[2:34:00] have we not prophesy it is not the vocal
[2:34:03] it is not the word the word may be
[2:34:05] coming from the Bible but the music is
[2:34:08] what is Behind the Music within the
[2:34:11] music that is the one that get the kill
[2:34:13] duad that is the one that can make a
[2:34:16] child jump that is the one that can make
[2:34:19] somebody shoot someone this is the music
[2:34:21] if the holy spirit is not there to catch
[2:34:25] it you don't have no filter my friend
[2:34:27] you're gonna suck any kind of thing and
[2:34:30] because and before you know it your way
[2:34:33] of cutting your hair you will match
[2:34:35] those people you will match them the way
[2:34:37] they're cutting the bill you will match
[2:34:39] their way they're doing their hair you
[2:34:41] will match their way they dress before
[2:34:42] you know it you will see your dressing
[2:34:44] are changing your behavior are changing
[2:34:46] and we want the why are we struggling
[2:34:48] why are we struggling why are we
[2:34:50] struggling we're looking for demon here
[2:34:52] demon there while the very beautiful
[2:34:54] demon you're getting is in the religious
[2:34:57] Realm
[2:34:59] okay because the devil cannot make you
[2:35:02] swallow pure rock and roll he cannot
[2:35:04] make you swallow pure rap he won't make
[2:35:07] you sorrow whatever secular musician is
[2:35:10] there he cannot make you swallow that
[2:35:12] you already been born and raised up if
[2:35:14] you come brother Stephen will show that
[2:35:16] everything he knows that he will take
[2:35:18] something else and put two cup of things
[2:35:21] and blend it together and hook it before
[2:35:23] you know it you're thinking you're
[2:35:25] getting the song you're really not
[2:35:26] getting the song you will find out that
[2:35:29] your behavior have changed why are you
[2:35:32] looking at someone and before you know
[2:35:33] it you want to copy them
[2:35:36] who's influencing who
[2:35:39] you're not going to influence them in
[2:35:40] meaning that song is taking over you
[2:35:44] amen watch what you're doing
[2:35:48] watch your changes watch your behavior
[2:35:51] but when you got the Holy Spirit you can
[2:35:53] sit down you can look at something and
[2:35:56] you say not this
[2:35:58] you can pick this one and say get this
[2:36:00] out and you remain the same and you
[2:36:02] don't change
[2:36:03] but if you begin to change to blend with
[2:36:06] them because that's what we're trying to
[2:36:08] do with young people even in a message
[2:36:09] we're trying to get the music and to
[2:36:12] blend it together so the young people
[2:36:14] because they're so exposed to this music
[2:36:16] on uh on Facebook this is what they
[2:36:20] listen all the time they post the young
[2:36:22] people in the message they post the
[2:36:24] music almost every day on social media
[2:36:26] one of them or five will always post the
[2:36:29] music and most of the music they post on
[2:36:32] social media are Pentecostal singer
[2:36:35] all of them
[2:36:37] what caught you is the beautiful voice
[2:36:40] what probably caught you is the word
[2:36:42] what probably caught you is the
[2:36:44] beautiful clip because whoever is
[2:36:46] singing is driving a BMW and looking at
[2:36:49] the clothing and looking at the sun
[2:36:51] that's what you want to watch you don't
[2:36:53] see what is being loaded later by
[2:36:56] learner it won't happen at night it will
[2:36:58] go one after the other after the other
[2:37:01] before you know it you won't see why is
[2:37:03] this wrong I don't see why is this wrong
[2:37:04] you're fighting you're not fighting
[2:37:06] really with it you have been loaded with
[2:37:08] other things those things are not loaded
[2:37:10] by the words you can read They're loaded
[2:37:12] through the instrument they wrote it to
[2:37:15] the genre they loaded through the music
[2:37:18] even military when they go to war they
[2:37:21] put something here when you really hit
[2:37:23] the air they can shoot without any
[2:37:24] problem and they can shoot with
[2:37:27] Precision music is a dangerous game
[2:37:31] it's a powerful tool if it's used
[2:37:33] correctly it will bring God down it will
[2:37:36] deliver somebody it will deliver you it
[2:37:39] will uplift you at home it will put you
[2:37:42] in a good atmosphere all of that is the
[2:37:44] benefit but remember the devil is up
[2:37:48] there to give you something else
[2:37:50] and it will do everything the opposite
[2:37:54] Why by music you will learn something
[2:37:57] without knowing it by music music can
[2:37:59] put you in the mood
[2:38:01] music can make you angry
[2:38:04] go see the people that are rapping that
[2:38:06] got angry because you don't know go at
[2:38:08] the barbershop and sit there because
[2:38:10] Barbershop are the prime number one to
[2:38:12] put music whether you like it or not
[2:38:14] they should do whatever they did so as
[2:38:16] you're sitting there 45 minutes that
[2:38:18] thing is hitting you boom boom until
[2:38:20] you're praying you say Lord made this
[2:38:21] stop that radio it's just a barbershop
[2:38:23] it's just the salon
[2:38:29] everybody okay and before you know it
[2:38:31] you come out there you begin to struggle
[2:38:32] like where did that list where did this
[2:38:34] music come you sit down two hours ago
[2:38:37] you were sitting there somebody
[2:38:38] registered that and put it here
[2:38:42] have you seen how hard it's for boys who
[2:38:45] look at pornography to remove those
[2:38:46] pictures
[2:38:48] it's easy to get in try to remove it you
[2:38:51] will suffer for months of praying try to
[2:38:54] get that thing out try to get that thing
[2:38:55] it's not getting out because they they
[2:38:57] really know how to put it when they put
[2:38:59] it they nail it the nail it they seal it
[2:39:01] they lock it until before you remove it
[2:39:04] you will really struggle
[2:39:06] it's easy to put a tattoo
[2:39:08] try to remove one it even costs more
[2:39:10] money to remove it until you doom to
[2:39:13] stay with it like that
[2:39:15] and you gotta wear a long seal so nobody
[2:39:17] sees what was going on there
[2:39:19] that's the devil
[2:39:21] any question
[2:39:23] any question
[2:39:27] any question
[2:39:31] let's stand
[2:39:34] there are few quotes that I didn't read
[2:39:36] but the quotes are here
[2:39:39] those who put their name we got them the
[2:39:41] coat
[2:39:45] oh my
[2:39:48] yeah some of them if you want you can
[2:39:50] read it at home
[2:39:51] if you look at the vision of the Bride
[2:39:54] coming up all of that
[2:39:57] it is there you will see all of this
[2:40:00] brother Branham said the new golgota
[2:40:03] of God where they are really killing God
[2:40:06] he says they're killing him in those
[2:40:09] short wearing women bob hair painted
[2:40:12] face singing in the choir like Angels
[2:40:14] said that is the gogota that is killing
[2:40:17] Christ I have it here
[2:40:20] amen
[2:40:22] so what you think praising God they
[2:40:24] actually killing God
[2:40:27] God is in music the right kind of music
[2:40:30] God is in singing the right kind of
[2:40:32] singing God is in dancing the right kind
[2:40:35] of dancing do we sing yes do we praise
[2:40:38] yes do we dance yes
[2:40:40] whatever you do do it decently and in
[2:40:43] order everybody okay
[2:40:46] so in this church
[2:40:48] we set the tune for the music it has
[2:40:50] nothing to do with my culture
[2:40:53] everything I put here he doesn't mention
[2:40:56] the word congoles here
[2:40:59] did you hear me mentioning anything did
[2:41:01] I mention American here you have nothing
[2:41:04] to do with anybody's culture he have to
[2:41:06] do with the word of God
[2:41:08] so when you want to filter a music tick
[2:41:10] part one take part two listen to the
[2:41:13] qualification of music through the word
[2:41:16] not through your culture through the
[2:41:18] word and look at that music over there
[2:41:22] filter it through that if he pass
[2:41:24] through it you can listen to it and you
[2:41:27] know that you're on a safe ground on
[2:41:29] something that you don't know amen
[2:41:33] when a man fell in love with a woman
[2:41:35] they have song they call slow
[2:41:37] they're not going to dance with you
[2:41:39] quickly they will dance with you slow
[2:41:40] and they put Whitney Houston
[2:41:42] and Whitney Houston will take you love
[2:41:45] you and then you go you go before you
[2:41:48] know it you'll find yourself in a hotel
[2:41:50] because that music is actually preparing
[2:41:53] you with the love the love the loading
[2:41:55] the Lord and all they're doing they are
[2:41:57] raising your passion they are raising
[2:41:58] your passion they're raising your past
[2:41:59] until you cannot resist that boy why is
[2:42:02] that boy when you're talking he want to
[2:42:03] push plagues so you can hear some slow
[2:42:06] some lovely song and things like that
[2:42:09] why do you why why why do they need that
[2:42:12] for because music will set the
[2:42:14] atmosphere that will actually take they
[2:42:17] will take over you amen oh no I listen
[2:42:20] to those kind of music I love them you
[2:42:23] will find yourself with a weakness
[2:42:25] when a boy speaks to you you don't know
[2:42:27] how to resist because you already wired
[2:42:30] with those kind of I'm insensible you
