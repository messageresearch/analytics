[42:29] on the other side about testimony how i
[42:31] got here tonight
[42:36] let's look at the genesis
[42:40] chapter 4.
[42:45] verse 8 once you have it say amen
[42:49] and cain talked with abel his brother
[42:52] and it came to pass when they were in
[42:55] the field
[42:56] that cain rose up against abel his
[42:58] brother and slew him
[43:00] and the lord said unto cain where is
[43:03] abel thy brother and he said i know not
[43:06] and i my brother's keeper
[43:08] and he said what has thou done
[43:11] the voice
[43:12] of thy brother's blood crieth unto me
[43:16] from the ground
[43:18] then let's go over to one more passage
[43:19] of scriptures and you may be seated
[43:22] let's go over to hebrews
[43:25] chapter 12.
[43:29] hallelujah
[43:30] hebrews chapter 12 and let's look at
[43:38] hallelujah verse
[43:40] 24. once you have it say amen
[43:45] and to jesus the mediator of the new
[43:48] covenant
[43:49] and to the blood of sprinkling that
[43:52] speaketh better
[43:53] things than the blood of abel may the
[43:56] lord add a blessing to his word you may
[43:58] be seated
[43:59] you know we're just looking at a
[44:01] thought here and
[44:03] i just prayed with us and
[44:05] got the inspiration out of the token
[44:09] the token
[44:11] and our topic tonight is the blood
[44:13] speaketh
[44:16] the blood speaking
[44:19] you know we believe in this time in the
[44:20] day that we're living in
[44:22] they've taken this lightly
[44:25] they've taken it lightly what the lord
[44:27] has done for us on cows right
[44:30] what the blood has really done you know
[44:33] we're moving somewhere
[44:35] it's been a while back god told us that
[44:37] we hear our origin is that right our
[44:40] origin is heaven
[44:41] we come from heaven we're going back to
[44:44] heaven we're thinking like god
[44:46] we were there before the word was spoken
[44:49] is that right he even shed a lamb before
[44:52] the foundation of the world because he
[44:55] knew that the things that satan was
[44:57] going to throw at us is that right
[44:59] he knew that the trials and tests that
[45:01] we were going to have but we want to
[45:03] look tonight by the grace of god be
[45:05] praying with us we're looking at the
[45:07] blood speaketh
[45:10] you know we're going to look at what
[45:11] this blood really is you know we're
[45:13] looking at in his time that we're living
[45:15] in now we're living below are your
[45:17] standards
[45:19] you got to take authority
[45:21] take authority of what god has given us
[45:23] in this age
[45:25] you know when the lord brother steve he
[45:27] opened up about that tabernacle and when
[45:29] he opened up about that tabernacle the
[45:32] tabernacle oh it just set me on fire i'm
[45:35] just oh gospel preacher i don't know
[45:37] much but i like to talk about jesus
[45:40] i like to tell somebody about jesus i
[45:43] like to tell them about the goodness
[45:45] about jesus because when you talk about
[45:48] jesus
[45:49] the goodness of god is that right sister
[45:51] is always there and he's talking about
[45:53] the goodness of god because jesus was
[45:56] good everything he did it was good is
[45:58] that right
[45:59] so we come we're talking about this
[46:01] tabernacle you know first when we came
[46:03] in the holy spirit has been working and
[46:06] showing us what's the main purpose he
[46:08] moses saw the plan of redemption
[46:12] god got to show us the plan of
[46:13] redemption you are being fortified to
[46:17] win back every sister every brother
[46:21] every family member you are being
[46:24] fortified to moving at is that right
[46:27] god showed us the plan god showed us the
[46:30] plan he said first she came in here what
[46:32] you had to make a decision is that right
[46:36] you know we fight against that spirit
[46:38] the organizations they always here in
[46:41] the institutions in other places they
[46:43] always say we got 50 decisions 100
[46:47] decisions you know they're looking at it
[46:49] the way that the denominational people
[46:52] are looking at it
[46:53] the decisions we know is not like what
[46:56] they're saying and got to say his
[46:58] decision did they come and do what she
[47:00] has to what service that right that's
[47:03] her decision she's serving and then
[47:05] after she's serving she's what resting
[47:08] is that right so we come in at this
[47:11] she's going to be rewarded that's our
[47:13] plan we looking to get out here any day
[47:17] the situation can set forth the rapture
[47:20] any day
[47:22] you can look around you it's a glorious
[47:25] time for us is that right
[47:27] now we're signing and crying for the
[47:30] conditions of the church is that right
[47:32] they're signing and crying so in this
[47:35] time now but we're rejoicing saints we
[47:38] want you to look at this because when
[47:40] naomi was there resting when ruth came
[47:44] into that uh tabernacle where ruth was
[47:46] resting but the most powerful thing it
[47:49] was it was that brazen altar is that
[47:51] right
[47:52] now we can be able to go out and share
[47:55] with someone about true repentance is
[47:58] that right a godless sorrow bring a
[48:01] godly repentance that we don't have to
[48:03] be repented of is no longer is that
[48:05] right how why because the truth the word
[48:09] corrects the error is that right that's
[48:11] why the teaching had to come to correct
[48:14] any error the manifestation not just the
[48:18] the third pull we know the third pawn is
[48:21] the opening of the word god shared that
[48:24] with us but it's the manifestation of
[48:27] the opening of the word he's requiring a
[48:30] live life now you got to come on up
[48:32] hither that's why the holy spirit is
[48:35] telling you we thank the lord for luther
[48:37] we thank the lord for wesley we thank
[48:40] the lord for pentecost the restoration
[48:42] of the gift but we're moving into the
[48:45] bride age saints
[48:47] god save the best for last we're moving
[48:50] into an age now with an authority with a
[48:54] living life a victorious live life every
[48:58] day is that right you can live in the
[49:00] holiness and the holiness every day why
[49:03] because you're a new creature in christ
[49:05] jesus and all old things have passed
[49:08] away you no longer think the way that
[49:11] you thought before
[49:17] talking about the blood
[49:19] the blood speaketh
[49:21] the blood's speaking we're going to look
[49:23] at it and let's see what the prophet of
[49:25] god said about this here this token he
[49:28] preached it was so important to him he
[49:30] knew that you had to have it this is the
[49:32] hour that's why the holy spirit is
[49:34] telling us when you get around in there
[49:37] when you get in that resting place when
[49:39] you're getting that holy place sir this
[49:41] isn't that time you're supposed to be
[49:43] self-examining time is that right you're
[49:46] going to move into the holiness of holy
[49:49] but we're going to show you some is not
[49:52] just living their thinking they're
[49:54] thinking like a lutheran you're thinking
[49:56] like wesley you're thinking like in
[49:58] there you're thinking like the
[49:59] pentecostal there is no condemnation who
[50:03] those that are in christ jesus who walk
[50:05] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[50:08] you do not let satan move you off your
[50:10] ground now once you got that baptism of
[50:13] the holy ghost you always moving forward
[50:16] everything is positive you're moving
[50:18] forward in these things
[50:20] i don't want to get ahead of myself i
[50:21] want to read this let's go back to
[50:23] genesis
[50:25] go to genesis let's look at king
[50:28] we know cain
[50:29] he was here
[50:31] genesis 4.
[50:34] let's look at genesis 4
[50:36] and 1. it says in adam
[50:38] adam knew eve his wife and she conceived
[50:41] and bear cain and said i have gotten a
[50:44] man from the from the lord
[50:46] and she again bear
[50:48] and said abel and abel was a keeper of
[50:50] the sheep but cain was a tiller of the
[50:53] ground and then now you drop down here
[50:55] to uh verse 5. he says but unto cain and
[50:59] to his offering
[51:01] he had not respect
[51:03] and cain was very roth and his
[51:05] countenance fell now let's stop here for
[51:08] a minute now we know brother branham
[51:09] talked about cain was a believer
[51:16] that's the beginning what about the end
[51:18] huh he's driving on every demon force in
[51:22] our lives to sit there in the midst of
[51:24] us is that right that's why he's
[51:26] addressing intellectual demon forces is
[51:29] that right in his age here now this is
[51:31] more than just an intellectual walk we
[51:34] have to understand what the lord is
[51:36] doing in his age here now
[51:39] now cain was a religious man came build
[51:42] altars caged with the church came
[51:45] worship cave praise the lord but cain
[51:48] was
[51:49] minded katie did not have the revelation
[51:52] that was sent for his day god did not
[51:54] honor cain's worship why god i denied a
[51:58] good king's worship it because cain come
[52:01] he was not from that sea he was already
[52:04] mean
[52:05] huh he was already jealous
[52:08] you see so you see where that came
[52:10] coming from first john 3 and 12 said he
[52:12] was the seed of the wicked one is that
[52:14] right so we know it is our here now
[52:17] we're moving into a real battle saints
[52:20] because you wrestle not against flesh
[52:22] and blood
[52:23] but against principalities and powers
[52:26] and rules in high places we're not gonna
[52:28] go dig in that area tonight as wednesday
[52:30] but one day god give us grace we'll show
[52:32] you about these demon forces remember
[52:35] the prophet god told us he said in every
[52:37] act there's a spirit behind it is that
[52:39] right now you got to understand you
[52:41] catch the spirit of the age is that
[52:43] right blind miserable wretched naked
[52:47] rich of good saying we don't need god
[52:50] that right now god is moving in this
[52:53] hour here now gathering up from all four
[52:56] corners of the earth is that right it
[52:58] won't be long saints we'll be going home
[53:00] soon
[53:02] look at k
[53:03] k was a religious man
[53:05] he's from now he said look at very sis
[53:08] look how
[53:09] the grace of repentance is
[53:12] he said the lord said on the king why
[53:14] are thou wroth and why is thy continent
[53:16] is falling if thou does well see if you
[53:20] do well shall thou not be accepted what
[53:22] are you saying why are you keeping them
[53:24] there in the church an hour and a half
[53:26] you know they don't need all of that huh
[53:29] all they need is they saved is that
[53:31] right we believe on the lord jesus
[53:33] christ is that right we're going to be
[53:35] saved nobody's taking away their
[53:37] salvation but then when they got over
[53:39] there to ask paul said have ye received
[53:41] the what the holy ghost since you
[53:44] believe is that right
[53:46] god promised to tie every loose end is
[53:49] that right before he got out of here so
[53:51] he's tying his looses some is grabbing
[53:54] these mysteries intellectually
[53:56] somebody's got the revelation of what
[53:58] god is really doing in his hour here and
[54:00] now
[54:01] now god is fortifying you and he's
[54:04] fortifying you to to win this battle we
[54:07] don't want to get that but we want you
[54:09] to see god is opening his word for you
[54:12] and i by his grace and his mercy so we
[54:14] can continue to grow and grow in faith
[54:17] and what we're going to rapture on out
[54:19] of here one day saints is that right
[54:21] because why faith come by hearing
[54:24] hearing the word of god is that right
[54:26] faith comes by hearing
[54:29] see faith is a substance that you have
[54:32] it's already in there it's a substance
[54:35] it's inside of you you read the word by
[54:38] the spirit and anointing of god to build
[54:40] up your faith is that right pray so much
[54:43] in the holy ghost building up your holy
[54:45] faith is that right talked about it in
[54:48] jews we are earnestly contending for the
[54:50] faith that was once delivered to the
[54:52] saints we don't care nothing about the
[54:55] devil the devil don't care nothing about
[54:57] you so we come in here when we minister
[55:00] we minister in the devil the revelation
[55:03] is when he's up here when the minister's
[55:06] up here in europe there satan is trying
[55:09] to interject you with a thought
[55:12] instead of receiving the thought of god
[55:14] is that right buddy tell us what cast
[55:17] down every imagination that try to
[55:20] exhort itself against god we're going to
[55:23] show you why the holy spirit stopped in
[55:25] the holy we're going to show you by his
[55:27] grace tonight about that prayer how you
[55:30] missing it in prayer we want to show you
[55:33] that's where paul saw that our prayers
[55:35] was like incense is that right
[55:38] let me stop it
[55:39] cain
[55:40] look what he told cain
[55:43] he says what are the wrath
[55:45] why is that counseling his father
[55:47] if thou does well
[55:49] shall not not be accepted
[55:52] and if thou does not well
[55:54] sin lies where at the door
[55:57] and unto there shall be it shall be his
[56:01] desire and thou shalt do what
[56:04] all he had to do was repent
[56:08] do what his brother's doing
[56:12] he came out at first god wouldn't even
[56:14] put him over top of his brother abel
[56:18] he said you will rule over him
[56:24] people people they don't they don't
[56:25] understand the revelation of repentance
[56:28] it's a gift that's granted unto you it
[56:30] opens that door jesus is the door
[56:33] no way
[56:35] look what he says
[56:37] he said now
[56:38] verse eight
[56:39] he said and cain talked with abel his
[56:42] brother and it came to pass when they
[56:45] were in the field that cain rose up
[56:47] against abel his brother and sue him
[56:50] okay he probably was talking about his
[56:52] sister he probably was out there telling
[56:54] them about the goodness of god
[56:56] ah he didn't want to know about the
[56:59] goodness of god
[57:01] he wanted to have it his own way
[57:04] see he wanted his own way that's why you
[57:07] get angry why men get angry because he
[57:10] can't have it their way
[57:11] god said humble yourself
[57:13] he said now look he said and the lord
[57:16] said on the king where is abel thy
[57:18] brother and he said i know
[57:20] i know not
[57:21] am i my brother's keeper
[57:23] and he look at his old lying spirit on
[57:25] him too characteristic of a devil is
[57:27] that right not only he's a liar he's
[57:30] jealous he's
[57:31] he's evil
[57:32] let me keep going he says and he said
[57:35] what has thou done
[57:37] the voice of thy brother's blood crieth
[57:41] unto me from the ground
[57:43] now we're talking about
[57:45] the blood
[57:46] speaking
[57:48] you know brother brandon mentioned this
[57:50] i know is a lot going to tie in i'm
[57:52] trying to do my best to stay with that
[57:54] point but he was working it with that
[57:55] token
[57:57] he knew there was a person having that
[57:59] token that you had to have it
[58:02] if you don't have it you're not going to
[58:04] make it out of here
[58:06] just say it plainly tell them straight
[58:08] in his end time
[58:09] you have to understand we'll show you
[58:11] some things that'll help you by the
[58:12] grace of god but the lord already showed
[58:15] you now you move from your justification
[58:17] we thank the lord for luther we thank
[58:19] the lord for wesley but you got to move
[58:21] from their justification is that right
[58:24] now you move from that outer court and
[58:26] you move from that sanctification when
[58:28] you move from that sanctification then
[58:31] you're moving it to the baptism of the

[1:13:25] that anyone knows that the blood is
[1:13:27] actually itself can't speak it's a
[1:13:29] chemistry is that right

[1:13:36] if you want to put that down you say
[1:13:38] yeah you look at genesis 4 and 10 we
[1:13:40] read that
[1:13:42] but the blood from abel cried from the
[1:13:45] grave is that right
[1:13:47] he was crying because at that time it
[1:13:49] was speaking against
[1:13:51] cain
[1:13:52] and we were speaking against cain but
[1:13:55] god heard that voice from the grave

[1:15:17] that he had been killed his blood was
[1:15:20] crying out against him let me say he
[1:15:22] says now if you get that
[1:15:25] and there you can go to hebrews 12 24 we
[1:15:28] read that he said the blood of jesus
[1:15:31] speak his better things than that of
[1:15:35] abel

[1:16:08] later part of his ministry when he came
[1:16:10] up in meetings in the holy spirit
[1:16:13] anointed him he had prayer lines and
[1:16:15] things because he knew that they were
[1:16:18] sinners he knew that they were they were
[1:16:21] out

[2:02:48] it's speaking even about the rapture
[2:02:50] and the change of the body
[2:02:53] oh my god
[2:02:54] blessed be the name of the lord this is
[2:02:57] a powerful
[2:02:58] wonderful message we can never over
[2:03:02] emphasize on the need of the blood amen
[2:03:06] that's why paul spoke to the galatians
[2:03:08] he said who has bewitched you you cannot
[2:03:10] forget the blood as you keep moving the
[2:03:13] blood is still there amen
[2:03:16] this is where the importance of
[2:03:18] fulfilling the tabernacle comes
[2:03:20] when you fulfill the tabernacle then you
[2:03:23] can go before god with a token and you
[2:03:26] say father i have been i repented i have
[2:03:29] been baptized i have been filled with
[2:03:31] the holy spirit and this is what your
[2:03:33] word say i have obey your word that's
[2:03:37] why i'm coming for your glory and i'm
[2:03:39] asking this
[2:03:41] amen that's why jesus said in saint john
[2:03:44] 15 he said if he bad in me
[2:03:47] in the holiest and my words abiding you
[2:03:50] you shall ask what ye will and it shall
[2:03:53] be done unto you because you're
[2:03:56] presenting the token
[2:03:58] amen
[2:04:00] don't be afraid
[2:04:01] nobody is worthy to stand here
[2:04:04] only jesus christ
[2:04:06] amen so every time every day we always
[2:04:09] claim that blood and we're moving in
[2:04:12] amen but we know if he fill you with the
[2:04:15] holy spirit you can approach him boldly
[2:04:18] in the throne of grace and ask for mercy
[2:04:20] amen
[2:04:21] think about in the old testament a
[2:04:23] harlot
[2:04:25] could be saved by the old token
[2:04:28] and not only her but her entire family
[2:04:32] amen until god took that family and
[2:04:36] dissolved that family in israel
[2:04:39] and you cannot find a trace
[2:04:42] of the family of rehab it is dissolved
[2:04:46] and it's lost in israel the only time
[2:04:49] she popped up she popped up in matthew 1
[2:04:52] and she popped up in the book of hebrew
[2:04:54] if i'm not mistaken among the heroes of
[2:04:57] faith
[2:04:58] and do you know she was the mother of
[2:05:00] who
[2:05:01] the mother of boaz
[2:05:04] that was rahab can you imagine rehab was
[2:05:08] the mother of boaz the one who's gonna
[2:05:10] bring redemption to roof
[2:05:14] you see
[2:05:15] it's all about the blood how many
[2:05:18] stories did boaz heard from her
[2:05:21] from his mother
[2:05:22] how many
[2:05:23] so when boaz see more about
[2:05:26] he understand what's going on
[2:05:28] he knows how to deal with strangers he
[2:05:31] knows how to approach strangers
[2:05:34] amen and he's the only one he loved his
[2:05:37] mother so much
[2:05:39] that he can love roof
[2:05:44] you see the wisdom of god
[2:05:49] did joshua told the spies that when you
[2:05:51] go to jericho go save anybody
[2:05:54] he didn't tell them to save anybody they
[2:05:56] were going for spying
[2:05:58] amen but god has a predestinated seed
[2:06:01] dead
[2:06:02] just like he sent our paul and silas to
[2:06:05] the prison because the jailer was there
[2:06:07] amen rehab was like the jailer in prison
[2:06:11] that have to be rescued not only her but
[2:06:14] her and her family not only the jailer
[2:06:16] but the jailer and his family amen they
[2:06:20] sent two in the new testament and they
[2:06:22] sent two in the old testament and both
[2:06:24] of them had the token
[2:06:28] amen
[2:06:30] the god who is reaching mercy
[2:06:33] no matter what's going on remember the
[2:06:36] blood and approach god now not blindly
[2:06:40] but you know what the word said with
[2:06:42] confidence with boldness approach him to
[2:06:45] the throne of grace and come closely in
[2:06:48] prayer and pray when you pray take your
[2:06:50] hand take your eyes off the
[2:06:52] circumstances don't look at the children
[2:06:54] don't look at what's going on go ahead
[2:06:56] and keep somebody was talking to brother
[2:06:58] brother and i'm what about cigarette but
[2:06:59] by them say forget about cigarette you
[2:07:01] keep moving that cigar it will fall off
[2:07:04] you don't have to be looking at the
[2:07:05] cigarette all the time then the more
[2:07:07] you're looking at the cigarette the
[2:07:09] problem you the more you're gonna get in
[2:07:10] trouble forget about it just keep
[2:07:12] claiming keep coming keep claiming and
[2:07:15] confessing claiming and confessing
[2:07:17] claiming and confessing before you know
[2:07:20] it things will change
[2:07:22] but i'm not gonna leave this world
[2:07:24] without a
[2:07:25] laodicea with my children all of them
[2:07:29] were entering
[2:07:30] that is my faith
[2:07:32] no matter how deep they are in the
[2:07:34] married clay or whatever they don't
[2:07:36] listen they don't want to come to the
[2:07:38] message i did everything that i can you
[2:07:40] are too hard on yourself for nothing
[2:07:48] if god wanted you to know what you're
[2:07:50] knowing now he would have told you a
[2:07:52] long time ago
[2:07:54] amen so stop sitting there i wish i knew
[2:07:57] this i wish i knew this i wish i knew
[2:08:00] this now that you know you remember the
[2:08:02] quote on sunday now that you know begin
[2:08:05] to move with that revelation
[2:08:07] forgetting things that are beyond now
[2:08:10] you start moving for those things that
[2:08:12] are reaching the hand
[2:08:14] amen so stop being hard on yourself
[2:08:18] oh the lord is unfolding all of this so
[2:08:21] it's my thought the reason why the
[2:08:23] family is like this god knew
[2:08:26] god knew
[2:08:28] that's what joseph told his brother they
[2:08:30] said joseph you're gonna kill us he said
[2:08:33] don't worry about it god knew that's god
[2:08:36] who allow you to me for me to be sent to
[2:08:39] egypt god knew what he was doing
[2:08:42] don't blame yourself take that hammer
[2:08:45] that you beat yourself on the head all
[2:08:47] the time put it in the garbage
[2:08:51] amen
[2:08:52] stand where you are
[2:08:54] if god rescue you at 2 forget about one
[2:08:57] if god rescue you at 20 from 1 to 19
[2:09:01] forget about it move on from 20 moving
[2:09:04] forward
[2:09:05] that's it because you didn't know it
[2:09:08] you didn't know any better
[2:09:10] amen you were working with the talent
[2:09:13] that you had
[2:09:15] and your talent could not produce but
[2:09:17] what you had
[2:09:18] if the preacher themselves were in
[2:09:20] trouble what do you expect the
[2:09:22] congregation to do
[2:09:24] if you have a calvin on the pulpit what
[2:09:26] are you gonna do brother branham said
[2:09:28] calvin was a murderer
[2:09:32] i will show you the code to down the
[2:09:33] road
[2:09:35] what are you gonna do what can you do
[2:09:37] under looter
[2:09:39] what can you do you have to reproduce if
[2:09:42] it's two you're gonna reproduce two
[2:09:44] that's the two that you get sometimes
[2:09:46] you were under a legalistic pastor
[2:09:48] that's why you behaved that way
[2:09:50] sometimes you were under a uh
[2:09:53] a calvinist pastor that's why you behave
[2:09:56] that way now forget about what happened
[2:09:58] before
[2:10:00] we have a blood
[2:10:02] that speak better things than the blood
[2:10:05] of evil that blood is more than your
[2:10:07] clorox
[2:10:08] when you take your sin and you dip it in
[2:10:11] the blood even your past even god
[2:10:14] himself cannot find it
[2:10:16] so no more blaming
[2:10:18] take that condemnation off keep moving
[2:10:21] you say from now on that i know what do
[2:10:23] i know my children are already out in
[2:10:25] the world that's fine let me start
[2:10:27] claiming them
[2:10:28] let me start confessing and let me start
[2:10:31] moving that's what you do rise where you
[2:10:34] are and begin to move forward amen if
[2:10:37] you are caught under justification stop
[2:10:39] blaming yourself that's the reason why i
[2:10:41] suffered all this year under
[2:10:42] justification no rise up you say thank
[2:10:45] god now i know where i am move on to
[2:10:47] sanctification if you were under
[2:10:49] sanctification rise up and move into the
[2:10:52] holy ghost if you already have the holy
[2:10:54] ghost then move on to adoption
[2:11:00] hallelujah
[2:11:02] then the burden is not any more
[2:11:04] legalistic the message becomes a joy
[2:11:08] it's not somebody telling you how to
[2:11:10] wear no there is somebody else that is
[2:11:12] dressing you that is leading you that is
[2:11:14] doing everything for you and all the
[2:11:17] benefit of calvary belongs to you
[2:11:20] amen
[2:11:21] you didn't mean no harm you thought this
[2:11:25] is the way i can raise my child that's
[2:11:27] what you taught you didn't know
[2:11:30] stop blaming yourself
[2:11:32] amen they're already adult you don't
[2:11:34] have that leverage again like you could
[2:11:36] have have if they were two years old so
[2:11:40] don't blame yourself
[2:11:42] god knows how he can catch them if god
[2:11:44] catches them he catches them pretty good
[2:11:47] more than you
[2:11:49] when god catches a child he's going to
[2:11:51] take him all the way down and make sure
[2:11:54] he's dead
[2:11:55] and then pull it around and resurrect
[2:11:57] and say
[2:11:58] this is it
[2:12:00] not you
[2:12:02] you handed that child for a long time
[2:12:04] it's always failure get your hand off

[2:12:23] we have a blood that speak better things
[2:12:26] than evil let's stand i hope and i
[2:12:28] believe somebody was strongly encouraged

[2:12:46] that means something is going on in your
[2:12:48] life

[2:12:51] amen
[2:12:52] blessed be the name of the lord what a
[2:12:54] wonderful powerful message you can see
[2:12:57] it's not brother kelly he didn't know
[2:13:00] about your trial he didn't know what you
[2:13:02] were going through
[2:13:04] god knew it and god directed this
[2:13:06] message tonight so you can understand
[2:13:09] it's about the token and this token
[2:13:13] it's a powerful token and it's the same
[2:13:16] token that is going back to the jews
[2:13:18] to rescue the 144. so this message is
[2:13:22] going to go back to the jews and remove
[2:13:24] the old atonement
[2:13:26] and rip that veil completely from the
[2:13:29] eyes of the jews
[2:13:30] until the jews look they say yes jesus
[2:13:32] christ was god and they begin to weep
[2:13:36] what a power in the message of brother
[2:13:38] branham amen
[2:13:40] let's pray heavenly father
[2:13:43] lord we thank you

[2:13:47] and this
[2:13:49] blessing that you open up tonight lord
[2:13:52] father to strengthen your children
[2:13:56] and to speak to them heart to heart
[2:13:58] for them to understand the very motive
[2:14:02] and objective of you unfolding your word
[2:14:05] father
[2:14:06] thank you for changing lives tonight
[2:14:09] and thank you for touching somebody

[2:14:14] hammer that the devil was using
[2:14:17] to take parent to the corner
[2:14:19] to take mother to the corner
[2:14:22] to take older one to the corner
[2:14:24] regretting if they could have a way to
[2:14:27] go back again and fix things
[2:14:30] father you know everything
[2:14:33] and you say that the footsteps of the
[2:14:34] righteous are ordered by thee
[2:14:37] father sometimes we wanted to have a
[2:14:39] better way than this
[2:14:41] but you so fit before the foundation of
[2:14:43] the world that this is the path we need
[2:14:46] to go
[2:14:47] and all that matters lord is for your
[2:14:49] children to understand
[2:14:51] and to recognize where they are
[2:14:53] and to turn around and move straight
[2:14:55] ahead towards zion

[2:14:59] you strengthen your
[2:15:01] your servant brother kelly
