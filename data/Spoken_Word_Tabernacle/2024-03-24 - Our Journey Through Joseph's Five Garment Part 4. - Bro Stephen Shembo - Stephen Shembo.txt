9 let's go my friend you there we're going to take off soon amen remember the former things you remember the scripture now of old for I am God amen amen and there is none like none else I am God and there is none like me clear you understand the scripture now how is that God verse 10 declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done saying my counsel shall do what stand and I will do all my what pleasure so God knows your end before you even start in other word there is nothing that is happening in your life that is out care God already have your movie but whatever he purpose whatever God plan that will happen that will stand you might be seated vers 11 calling a reverence bird from the East the man that execute my counsel from a far country yeah I have spoken it I also will do what bring it to pass I have purposed it I will also do it when God purpose something regardless of what happened it will happen amen amen let's go to the book of Hebrew chap 2:9 glory to God those on YouTube okay now Brother David praise God Amen Hebrew chapter 2 verse 9 very familiar scripture the counsel of God the plan of God the purpose of God will stand amen amen no matter what happened God's purpose will stand amen Hebrews chap 2:9 if you dare you can say amen amen very familiar scripture again the Bible say but we see Jesus who was made how a little lower than the Angels so Jesus was not lower than the angel he was higher than anything higher than the highest he was the top but for some reason God took him and made him lower even lower than his own servant the angel what's the purpose of it why can I leave from a higher level going down condescending why brother uh the Bible says that he was made lower than the angel for the suffering of death because you cannot kill God that's right so God have to be condescended so that you can kill God they killed the man Jesus Christ that's right but they could not kill God still but God was so identify with the body of Jesus Christ until when you kill Jesus you killing God it is counted as you killing God everybody okay I hope I'm not losing you glory and honor that he by the grace of God should taste death for who every man for he became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons to glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through what suffering so suffering bring perfection you remember last Sunday right Paul say our glory in Tribulation so it's a Perfection because Joseph means Perfection amen will you remember that Perfection through suffering and Christ himself was our example sufferings plural amen verse 11 for both he that sanctifies and they who are Sanctified are all of what water so so we are no different than God Amen am that's why we are Gods we and God are one amen so if Jesus went through this treatment what do you expect you're going to get a portion of that treatment unless you in a different species come on now brother than the Lord Jesus Christ but if you look like the groom expect to go through the groom's treatment because that material have a certain treatment amen amen and the Bible say they are all one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them what so Jesus is our brother amen amen amen glory to God let's go to First Peter chapter 4 then we pray this message help us understand who we are the Lord and that God is not somebody far away and we are little little little little subject no we came out of God we came from God and we are going back to God whatever happened to Christ belong to us that's why brother BR I'm say whatever speak of the groom speak also of the Bride amen let's go to First Peter chapter 4 verse2 if you dare you can say Amen then we can pray the Bible says beloved you know who's beloved we went through this before beloved I want you to prosper in all you remember all of that beloved we are in the Beloved in Christ beloved think it not strange concerning the veryy trial which is to try you in other word when a trial comes God don't want you to take it like I was not expecting this I didn't know this going to happen God said do not take it strange amen right just expect it because it's going to perfect you so do not think it strange it's not strange don't think it's strange amen amen it's not strange it is common amen there is a purpose for it he said beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial not just a trial it's a fiery one it's really painful amen a fiery one amen a fiery a painful trial a painful test when he comes do not think it strange don't be crying like this is the end of the world no sir amen amen amen which is to try you as though some strange thing has happened to you that's it amen God is telling you if something really painful comes don't look at that thing like what is this no it is common in other word first belittle it amen amen that's it amen am amen am amen amen do you know those who play soccer when they send the ball into you the first thing you do you need to take the ball and stabilize it so when the trial is coming you put it down first you say slow down you're coming too much with energy come on down slow down what are you looking for what are you here for what is your purpose in my life why did God open the door so that you can come why are you coming my way amen do you have the right address or you miss the address that's before you start crying before you start calling everybody amen that's it amen amen amen verse 30 but do what Rejoice ouch we would love to say cry God say when a fiery trial comes what do you do Rejoice but Stephen you don't know what I'm going through when a fiery child comes what do you do Rejoice Rejoice how can I rejoice when it's painful it hurt but rejoice in as much as you are how partakers of who Christ sufferings so actually it's an identification there it is that you are actually part of Christ God when a painful trial is coming it is actually a an ID an identification so when it comes you say praise the Lord so finally devil you realize that I look like Christ in other words finally devil you realize that I am a God Amen because this kind attack only happen to God Amen there it is brother amen am so you truly acknowledge who I am you truly understand who I am you now understand my caliber that I'm not just a human being I'm a God in human flesh amen and I deserve a god trial amen a God test am a god trouble yes sir so that I can display my godship amen amen Lord why do you rejoice because it's an identification am that you are with Christ that you are actually sharing amen the pants of Christ because brother say he left a measure of suffering that's right if you're not his you're not going to get it only his children will get it he says partaker of Christ suffering that when his glory shall be H revealed you may be glad also with what exceeding Joy because we will appear with the same glory amen if you be reproached for the name of Christ what is next happy are you happy are you for the spirit of what glory and of God Rest where upon you so you cannot have a trial of Christ if the Holy Ghost is not dead yes sir because when Jesus Christ received the Holy Ghost he was taken to the Wilderness to be tempted amen glory glory glory am so when the trial is coming it is actually identifying you that something is in you am give me time if I can get to that I will show you why does the devil fight you amen amen the Bible say happy are you for the spirit of glory and of God do what resteth upon you on their part he is how evil spoken of but on your part he is what glorified so when the trial are coming God is trying to glorify himself amen yes sir but on the other side they're gossiping about they saying all bad kind of stuff about you they are lying about you but on the other part God is glorify that exactly what happened to me now it's happening to my child glory to God Rejoice amen hallelujah the Lord hallelujah hallelujah amen on one side evil spoken of you but on the other side it is for your glorification amen amen you gossip about somebody so much until people want to see that person it is they say you always talk bad about this person let me at least see that person so you were actually advertising amen amen am can you say amen amen have I said something wrong glory to God verse 15 but let none of you suffer as a what a murderer I don't want you to suffer because you're guilty that's right if you stole they put you in jail that's not for the glory of God it is usually when you have not done anything yes sir come on come on Amen when you are completely innocent then it's God working but I don't want you to be guilty because guilty goes with a correction amen are we together so now you need to evaluate trial when they coming am I receiving this because I done something wrong or because I have not done anything if you have not done anything you know what it's going you know which direction you're heading if you done something wrong you repent and you go back in line again and you move on the Bible says but let none of you suffer as a what a murderer or as a what a thief or as a what evildoer or as a what a busy body do you know what a busy body is do you know what a busy body is always is a bad people's mother entering this family that family that family that family that family if you are suffering because of that don't glorify God that oh I'm going to trial you got a problem amen you gossip too much you cannot see a problem passing without you putting your hand on it that's a Busy Body Spirit God say I don't want anybody to suffer like that right suffer as innocent am amen the Bible say Busy Body in others men's what in other word those those things don't even belong to you but you always stick your nose into it am you a busy body we don't want Busy Body amen amen verse uh 16 yet if any man suffer as what a Christian you see that suffering amen not as a murder not as a thief not as somebody who did something bad not as a busy body but you are suffering because you are a Christian because with a Christian they go a fiery painful trial for your Perfection because it's the pattern that was established by Jesus Christ himself Jesus was perfected Jesus never have the glorified body until Calvary amen after Calvary that's when he got the glorified body and Jesus with a glorified body you can't do him any more harm amen verse 16 yet if any man suffer as a Christian let him not be what ashamed but let him do what glorify God on this what behalf that's why they say when you're going through this trial be happy amen are we clear put your seat belt and let's climber Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you again humbly this morning Father we thank you for your grace you love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father this is as far as I can go with the ability you have just given me but when it comes to bless your children oh Lord to interpret your word and bring a message I am completely unworthy and I do not even qualify because what we're dealing with is the purchase of your blood father may you move me completely out of the way may you be the Alpha and the Omega and speak to your children be the one speaking and the one interpreting as the inside teacher as we traveling through this be Lord father the beginning and the ending in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen my subject this morning is our life journey through Joseph five garment part four amen amen our key theme scripture that we're dealing with is Roman 8: 28 and the Bible says that we know that all things whether it's good and bad you know you remember last Sunday all things work together for what good to them that love God to them who are called according to the purpose his purpose so whether it's good whether it's bad whether somebody say hello whether somebody didn't say hello all of that work together for good amen whether it's sickness whether it's blessing that's right brother it works for your good amen all things work together for good amen amen amen we have established five garment follow me carefully the first garment that we established was the Garment of Many Colors which we are dealing with right now amen you know what it means now the second one is the Garment of a what a servant or what or a slave we went through this the third garment is a garment of a what a prisoner amen the fourth one was the Garment to appear before Pharaoh you remember that to appear before Pharaoh amen amen and the last garment is the Garment of fine Ling amen which was given to Joseph before Pharaoh himself amen amen every one of this garment is associated with a test am am everyone of this government is connected combined with a test a trial a trouble or a challenge amen are we together amen when he got the call the the the Court of Many Colors he was betrayed by his brother amen we are still there he was put in a pit will you remember amen and he was also sold for 20 pieces of silver amen what a disappointment when he went into Egypt in the house of Piper under the slave or the servant garment he was also lied on by the wife of Piper amen amen amen when he went into prison he also got through a test where is that test Pastor let's go to Genesis chapter 40 glory to God I can give it to you but I don't want you to say brother Steven say the Bible say brother Bram say amen amen let's go to Genesis chapter 40 we see the third challenge or the third test Genesis 40:14 if you dare you can say amen amen the Bible says we went through this with the battler and Joseph we went through this clearly in detail but think on me when he shall be well with you you know what it means show me kindness every sermon amen I pray you to me and make mention of me to pharaoh and bring me out of this house verse 15 for indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews and here in p4's house also have I done nothing that I that they should put me into the dungeon so Joseph found a great opportunity somebody connected to Pharaoh some high officer of pharaoh that was put into the same place that Joseph was and he knew that this man is going to be restored back again and this man is very next to Pharaoh because it's the man that bring Pharaoh his own drink so he SL he he he slipped up his request and say hey praise the Lord God put this connection together so now I can get my freedom so remember whenever you go back to Pharaoh don't forget me go and speak about me so they can take me out of here so he put his trust in a man that's right and Jah say cursed be who take his trust and put it in man no matter how much connection you get it always keep your focus in God am even if your brother or your friend is next to the president don't put your trust in him amen put your trust in God am because you're going to be disappointed amen God want to have the full preeminence amen God want to be the top of your life amen yes sir are we together amen are we together am this is why people beg people people are drained by people in their noses because you are trusting into man you want to please men to get favor your favor is coming from God your blessing come from God your destiny is in the hand of God not in the hand of a man that's it amen Joseph took this opportunity and said you know what let me let me jump on it get my request so he was expecting that uh in 3 days the man will be restored so maybe after 3 days next week Pharaoh will call me and say get this man out of it did it happen this is the challenge of the prison drop into verse 23 glory to God if you dare you can say amen amen verse 23 yet did not the what Chief Butler do what remember Joseph he didn't remember when he got there he forgot everything he was not the chief battler he was God that was trying to teach Joseph something amen he did not remember Joseph but what forgot her so the challenge in the prison is that he was forgotten forsaken by the very man that he help every Mentor every Court every garment goes with a challenge amen am are we together amen are we together amen forsaken by the very man the very man that he help amen amen what a challenge jop to verse uh chapter 41 verse one if you dare you can say amen amen the Bible says this and it came to pass at the end of what two full years that Joseph Dream uh that Pharaoh dream and behold he stood by what the river how long was this uh thing happening years your tribulation birth patience amen remember last Sunday am you remember last Sunday so this man forgot him for two full not two two full that's what the Bible say two full years betray put in Pat sold lied on by the wife of Piper put your trust into a man and the Very man forsake you and forgotten you for two years can't even remember Joseph every garment every coat every Mentor goes with a trial amen everybody did amen and the third one was the C to appear before Pharaoh amen let's look at that challenge if you drop down to verse 8 with me we on 41 verse 8 and it came to pass in the morning that his Spirit was troubled this is the spirit of pharaoh and he sent and call for all the Magician of Egypt and all the wise men thereof and Pharaoh told them his dream but there was what none that could interpret none that could interpret them to who Pharaoh everybody clear there jop to verse 14 then Pharaoh sent you know the story we went through this then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph amen and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon and he shaved himself this is that garment and changed his Remnant everybody clear and came into Pharaoh are we there amen and Pharaoh said to Joseph I have dream a dream and there is none that can interpret it and I have heard say of you that you can understand a dream to interpret it Joseph didn't come out of of a dream because just somebody talk about him he came out of the prison because of a challenge he was coming into a challenge amen there was a dream that Pharaoh had and no one was able to interpret the dream am so they are pulling him not just like that they pulling him into a challenge to see whether he's going to be able to interpret the dream or not every government goes with a challenge amen he goes with a test am he goes with a trial amen he appear with a challenge to interpret the dream amen everybody okay amen everybody good amen what about the last garment the Garment of fine lining where is the challenge of that garment brother Steven because we know after everything Joseph was nice and everything was gone we didn't see any trouble with Joseph anymore let's go to Genesis 15 this is important because when we will SAR into those garment it will help you down to the last one Genesis 50 verse 15 if you dare you can say amen amen the last challenge a hard one you there amen verse 50 now Joseph is in power Joseph is the is is a governor whenever he comes out when the sand they blow the trumpet guess what everybody even if you on the highway you put the music when the when Joseph is coming and you hear woo woo woo woo get out of the land and not only getting out of the land you get out of the land then you bu down amen because Joseph is coming in other words Joseph is in a position of authority am and power there is a challenge that goes with that that's right you ready are you ready amen praise be to the name of the Lord let's go to verse 15 the Bible says and when Joseph Breen saw that their father was dead they said to Joseph will perhaps they they said Joseph will perhaps hate us and will certainly repay us all the evil which we did to him Jesus come on are we together so they were expecting a Revenge yes that's your trial on the last one follow me carefully amen and they send a messenger to Joseph saying your father did command before he died in other word we already talked to Daddy about this thing this is the message daddy said before he passed away not them they are using their father because they knew they already messed up saying verse 17 so shall you say to Joseph forgive that's it the last trial the greatest one when you in power when you have the spoken word am when you can say disappear and you disappear there is another challenge it's the challenge to forgive am those that Tre you bad a Amen brother Bram had many expression of the third pool he spoke sare and everybody in the message want to talk about it brother brandham spoke to the storm everybody in the message want to brag about it but there was a different challenge of the third pool God allowed two young men to come into the church and start kissing in the very pews and God told Brother Bram you going to have a great test and God himself come and say speak whatever you say to these two whether you want them dead they're going to died right there that was the greatest challenge of the temp is to forgive those that have been mistreating you brother Bram look at them he say I forgive you am brother Bram could have sent them to Hell amen every garment goes with a trial every government goes with a test every government have a challenge and the last comment is whoever mistreated you when you in power you must give what Christ did in his third pool father forgive them because they don't know what they were [Applause] doing hallu any question my friend any question my friend so we got five garment every government is connected with a trial is connected with a challenge is connected with a trouble or a test amen and if you are not well trained that's it that's it that's it especially those who came from the countries where there is a lot of ruales or a lot of Witchcraft come on come on Lord because every time something good happen it is followed by something bad Joseph love of his father suddenly a tragedy happened Joseph in the House of P for everything is going good suddenly he's Li on

26:2 he said as the bird by what wandering and what as the swallow by flying uh-huh so the curse causeless shall not come do you know what it means do you know what it means do you know what it means if you notice every time Joseph was traveling do you follow me every step was prospering amen follow me carefully I'm trying to help you up my friend I'm using big stabilizing am when they put him in par for house everything begin to prosper then they T the lie on him when they put him in prison everything begin to prosper everybody okay am then somebody who he have forsake Him what you need to

chapter 37 praise God oh glory to God today you moving very good the front is finished let's start now the back the front is finished let's start the back my friend you maying very good sometime you lock me somewhere Glory if you fool we fool we go home Genesis 37 let's look at this part of the coat of many colors if you thereare you can say Amen remember Joseph went to Sheck and sheim was not the correct airport because the flight was not there that's right it was not the good terminal so somebody was there and say let me see your ticket you have to read between the lines and they look at the ticket they say no no no no your terminal is over there it's called Doan that's where the flight of Ishmael at was coming going to Egypt so Joseph must get into that flight because that's the flight that is according to God's purpose for him we are in doten my friend with Joseph what happened in this do do means two Wells or double Well Do Dwell that's where the airport is what happened in Dothan let's go to verse uh 17 if I can cross this scripture then we s you there amen verse 17 and the men say they are departed from here for I heard them say let us go where to do and Joseph went after his Brethren and found them where in do Dothan why and when they saw him what a far off even before him came near to them they did what conspired against him to slay him if somebody is far off you probably can't tell who that person is until they get closer or unless you have some binoculars that you can look and say hey this is brother Robert coming up but if brother Robert is Far Far Away there is no way to do it but God allowed Joseph to have something that can can identify him from a far off if they just see the coat with many colors whether they didn't see the face they know who's coming they know that it's Joseph so your court allow the enemy sometime to make a conspiracy against you amus put your seat Bel my friend the airplane is going this way my friend you not going to fall your quat the identification that God put on Joseph give time to hisen to make a quick conspiracy because when they saw that touch Joseph guys meeting come quickly we need Jose so so that that coat set him off your coat set you off your coat is what trouble what what turn on the trouble am are we together in 10 Joseph was a prophet that's right Joseph saw Visions but Joseph never saw the vision of what's going to happen in do are we together are we together if he knew it he would not have gone God turned his spiritual nuclear off because there is a purpose if God open that up Joseph will run away from the purpose so God turn him off yes sir are we together are we together so don't turn is a place where your nuclear engine I turned off by God Amen because if this ever open you won't you won't fall into God's plan in other words is a place where you are taken unaware it and aware to you but with open eyes to God that's why the Bible say thinking not strange God is watching you are the one that God turned to be ignorant amen about the plot that is going under for you amen am when I get into this place I'm in surgery okay I'm in surgery so at this time I'm getting material from my assistant and keep moving so I'm in surgery deep one so keep the EKG and everything working yes sir okay sister Rosemary sister Emy keep the EKG flowing very good everybody okay check that blood pressure machine and everything everybody okay and the Bible says this that that verse uh uh 18 when they saw him where a far off even before he came near so His Garment turn him off the enemy saw they say okay let's conspire quickly so by the time he get here we just go to action Joseph is unaware that he's walking through the valley of the shadow of what but David say do work am hallu through the valley of the shadow of death I do what I will fear no evil for that with me if God open your eyes you'll be afraid so God shut the nuclear engine so you can walk happily but you don't know you getting into danger H GL can I continue can I continue am in the back can I continue Jesus praise God where are we at my friend um 19 Verse 18 and they conspire against him to do what slay him verse 19 and they say one to to another behold he this what dreamer coming if you notice they didn't say behold Joseph comeing behold who this dreamer coming where the opening of The Seven seal the Bible become a new they don't call him Joseph they call him the dreamer in other word what BS them more is the spiritual aspect am your gift bother people the gift God put in your life it cause trouble to people amen people can't stand it amen when they saw you they say that singer is coming that drum player is coming that preacher is coming you know my name why don't you call me by my name so this is what bothers you are we together are we together are we together amen a a pastor sent me a message from London I never seen him he said pastor I love the way your congregation react so they love you the way you react you a love congratulation to [Applause] yourself everybody okay amen let's go to verse 20 let's go my friend you there yes sir come on therefore and let us do what slay him and do what cast him into some pit and uh and we will say what some evil Beast has devoured him let's go slowly they want to slay him and they have a message to cover up the evil deed and the message is what an evil Beast a wild beast the message is a wild beast an evil Beast have done have done what theour him devour him amen so they already have their plan and they have even the solution to handle it Joseph doesn't know anything we are in those hand Amen in this place of Dell everything okay amen everything okay am we on verse 20 and he said devour him and we shall see what will become of what Dre so what trouble the most is what they didn't say we will see what will happen to the court of many color no we will see what will happen to his dream we will see if he's going to reach his destination or not but brother Bram say five good news here that what God purpose in your life no one nothing no demon no sickness will block it from happening when you are challenging my dream you challenging God because I didn't do that for myself I was only elected by God I love Jacob Jacob didn't do anything can I continue jum to verse 25 my friend thank you Lord this is where we were and they sat down to eat bread and they lift up their eyes and look and behold what a company of ishmaelite came from gilean they called them ishmaelite and medanite if you want to know where is that the medanite and isite is the same thing put the question in a question box so I can save time and I will answer you in question and answer and prove it to you that they're the same people okay it's not to Caravan it's not two flight it was still American Airline or Delta whichever one you prefer because they say Pastor love whichever you prefer okay and they sat down to eat bread and they lift up their their eyes and look and behold the water a company of Israelites came from Gill with their camel bearing spices and bomb and what going to carry it down to what so you see the destination is going that's where Joseph is supposed to go so the flight is correct the airport is correct job to verse 26 and Judah said to his Brethren what profit is it that we slay our brother and conceal his blood and come let us sell him to the ishmaelite and let us not uh not our hand be upon him for he is our brother and our flesh and his brethren were content the lion spoke amen everybody have to Hash verse 28 then they passed by the Medan it's the same people put that question in the question box I'm trying to save time if I try to prove it to you now we lose time amen the medanite merchantmen and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit brother Angel told you Joseph was in the pit now we are pulling Joseph out of the pit amen and so Joseph to the ishma for 20 pieces of silver and brought Joseph to what Egypt everybody clear so far amen watch clearly and Ruben returned so God remove Ruben because Ruben would have blocked the plan of God God took Ruben away that coworker got sick he cannot be the day they have to fire you God allows some varish to hit him so he call on that day he say I cannot be in a I'm inan at work today I have a stomach VAR God is prog God is removing out of the place so you can be kick out so you can leave that comfort zone are we together everything is working together for good even the bag of your coworker the stomach virus that catch you for work is working for your good amen amen amen oh yeah where am I at and Ruben returned 29 to the pit behold Joseph was not in the pit and he rent what his clothes and he returned to his Brethren and said the child is not and I where shall I go what am I going to tell Daddy amen and they took Joseph coat amen and they kill a kid of a what goat poor goat is killed for lies and dip the coat in the water and they sent the coat of many colors and they brought it to their father and say this have we found no now whether it be your son's or what or no if you notice follow me carefully they never sent a message to the father of Joseph they only took the C dip it in the blood and send it and say you deserve but their original thought follow me carefully was that when they see the evidence they will say what a wild beast has what when they send the court they didn't give that message they let the one who's receiving the CT to decode to discern and the one who was receiving the Cod was a prophet but God turn also that engine off come on Lord are we together are we together they never say this is the quot of Joseph go give it to Daddy and say hey a wild beast has devouring no they just take your message what is evidence for sistera take this send it but when they sending there is an intent but they don't associate the intent with it the intent will be developed by the one receiving it I'm reading to you the Bible my friend they say look and you yourself do the discern in other way do the ma and find out what the message is there but they knew the message they want to convey is a wild the Beast has what and that's the message that was decoded you might not say a message right out but your vibration the brde will catch it you can send just a message blank but we know what you're trying to say listen to this my friend verse 33 and he knew it and say it is my what son's cold that's correct and and what an evil Beast has what deved was that true how can a prophet decod a lie come on brother amen they never say a wild beast deod him if you ask them hey why did you send this no we just send they we told him to discern but the one discern him say a wild be how did he match their intent how William Marion Bram am help us up a little bit he says but God in his prophet and in his SE and so forth absolutely knows that these things as God will what reveal it there is many thing he don't reveal to his servant amen amen look at old Jacob sitting on a stone sitting up there and brought his boy's coat back and you know he was a prophet brought his court back and say a beast kill your boy that was wrong he didn't know the difference for 40 years wow God turned the nuclear engine of Joseph off and he turned the nuclear engine off of a prophet off both of them are believing lies and Jacob is grieving Upon A Lie which is not a truth based on what the BR orchestrate to send it to him where in Doan what is going on in this place Doan let's go to second king chapter 6 father help me if we can s here quickly that would be great second Kings chapter 6 if you thereare you can say amen amen you're moving pretty good my friend in other word God is locking all spiritual discernment that's right because there is a purpose second kingap 6 verse 8 you there amen somebody can even say hallelujah already verse 8 if you there you can say amen amen then the king of Syria war against Israel and took CER with his servant saying in a such and a such a place shall be my camp and the man of God Elisha sent to the king of Israel saying be aware that you pass not such a place for the is Syrian uh for the Syrian I come down and the king of Israel sent you there to the place which the man of God told him and warn him of and save him there not once nor what in other word multiple time when the Syrian set up and Ambush Elisha will come and say hey don't go down 74 they're going to try to kill you there the king say okay send spies there to watch and they watch exactly tomorrow he say don't take 85 go through 74 you take 85 they get you tomorrow he said don't take 77 and finally it's too much in other word the gift of Joseph was bothering his brother the gift of Elijah is bothering the enemy every time the enemy is trying to set up something Elish is the one breaking it his sermon are disturbing the devil that's right am his sermon stirring the devil every time the devil is planting something in spoken word the sermon will come and destroy it the seron will come and destroy it the seron will come and destroy it hallelujah hallelujah am hallelujah amen jum to verse 11 therefore the heart of the king of Syria was so trouble for this thing and he call his servant and say to them we will you not show me which one of us is is of the king in other word please whoever is a spy speak up go ahead speak up here I'm tired of this every plan we work doesn't work because of a gift a prophetic gift verse 13 uh verse 12 and one of his his servant brother brandham say he had some spirituality one of his servant say no my Lord oh King but who Elijah the prophet that is where in Israel tell the king of Israel what the words that thou speakest in thy bedroom somebody say no there is nobody here there is only one person when you talk to your wife in your bedroom that man can tell you when you argue with your wife in your bedroom on Sunday morning he will speak it whatever you are discussing on your in in your living room just go Sunday morning he will leave tell you about everything you were talking like somebody who was with you there the devil don't like it not they don't like the man but the gift the spiritual gift that is in the man amen because it's setting families free it is setting people free am amen can I continue amen can I continue amen and he go verse and he said go and spy where is it that I may send and bring him they say you know what since we found out that the the the whole forces of this nation lays in a man so if we can Target the man Israel is blind go find where does he stays and me and you are going to find where does Elijah stay where was the home of Elijah remember that home do is two Wells and Elijah has a double portion so Elijah must be in the place with a double well can I continue when I dance like this it's too my anointing my friend amen verse uh uh 13 that Ascend and bring him and he was thought saying behold he is where Elisha was staying where in do what is going on in Doan Lord help me if I can get where I'm trying to get please verse 14 therefore send he there what horses one man one man The Chariot of Israel one man they sending a whole Army they're sending what horses you there my friend yes sir let me tried to use here desc sending what horses and what chariots and what a great host for one man without even a weapon without even a gun hes and what and a great what H continue and they came by night and they came by night and what Compass the city about and Compass the city and what and when the servant of the man of God was risen early uhh and gone forth uhhuh behold in host Compass the city both with horses and chariots stop with horses and chariots and his servant say him IAS my master how shall we do stop follow me carefully Joseph saw dream about his future but when he was going to to D God turned his nuclear engine off he didn't see the dream that he himself is getting ambushed yes Elisha was decoding every ambush of the king of Syria but when he came to his own Ambush he was unable to decoded God turn him off d a place where God turn you [Applause] off are we together are we together Jesus Mar Bram let me back it up with some screws my friend sir Elisha seen where that King was going to do that and so he sent the king of Israel and said now don't go down that way because they are laying down their wedding watch that same Prophet after getting down where to the angel of the Lord never show him a about syan coming out and covering the city every ambush he has it but the ambush of his own life God turn him off where in do can I continue for God has what another way for that another plan God don't show his servant what all things but he shows his servant just the what the word of knowledge as much as they have need to know so you see he lays in what God's power not what in the power of man though man be blessed by yet God is what the father and the what the ruler over all never did they show to Elisha they coming to Doan he will run Doan is a place when you get there your nuclear engine I turn off because God is going to take you to a different battle to a different journey to a different course of your life he turned the nuclear engine off what happened can I continue verse uh 15 and when the servant of the man of God was risen early and gone forth Behold a hor comess the city both with horses and Chariot and his servant said to him elas my master how shall we do and he answered what fear not for they that be with us are what are more than they that be with them don't is a place where God in The Invisible World come on is present even though you are handling Joseph God is ready he just turned the nuclear engine off Hallelujah am all you can see is the trouble around all you can see is the trial around all you can see is how many people are gossiping they calling each other on the phone they're talking about me that's all you can see you in 10 but remember remember there is another layer in if God ever open your eyes you will see that everything is under control am nothing is God is controlling every move Amen brother Bram say even Jesus Christ when he was at the cross there were Angel laying right there they were waiting for his signal GL amen amen can I continue verse uh uh 17 and Elisha prayed and said Lord I pray you do what open his eyes that he may see and the Lord open his eyes of the who the young man and he saw what and behold behold what the mountain was full of horses let's go slowly watch my board the mountain was full of what horses and what chariots and what of fire round about Elisha so God already matched the devil you came with Chariot God put Chariot you came withes God put Chariot so there is already a match for the devil even though it seems like you going through hard time God already prepared something and he's matching the enemy in 10 in 10 oh my god let's go my friend and round about the Chariot of fire round about who elishah Verse 18 let's go my friend I'm almost there verse go 18 and when they came down to him Elisha prayed the Lord and said do what Smite this people I pray you with what blindness brother Bram say it didn't mean they became blind like this brother Bram say they became blind to Elisha they were seeing because Elijah told them follow me and they were following they were seeing but they don't see they don't see what is necessary for their Operation God took you and had you in the radar the enemy doesn't see you but you are there in other word God make you disappear from the rad of the enemy it's inded when you going through that hard trial when everything is against you just know you are disappearing from the radar because they didn't Ambush you they Ambush God am and God is going to match them amen are we together amen are we together amen oh my God I'm good my friend I don't know where we swing I'm good let's go my friend and he smart them with what blindness according to what word of el the Lord of elishah that was 19 and Elisha said to them this is not the what the way neither is this what the city do what follow me and I will bring you to who the man whom you see I'm going to bring you to Elijah to Elisha D is a place that whoever gather against you is actually falling under your [Music] [Applause] power whoever conspire against you in they are finished am am slow down my friend let's let me read this in Isaiah the Bible says this behold they shall surely do what gather together but what not now it's not going to be my plan but the enemy will gather but it's not God whosoever shall what gather together against thee shall what fall for thy sake period amen can I continue uhhuh behold I have created what the Smith that bloweth the water the coals in the fire and that bringeth forth water an instrument for his work and I have created what the was the waster should destroy God is saying the one who's making the weapon I created him the one who sell the weapon I created them so whoever is included in the in uh in the trial that you have I have control over them when they were making the weapon I was there when they saw the weapon I was there so don't worry I'm controlling them can I continue he says no weapon am form against the shall what shall prosper and every tongue that that rise against you in judgment that shall do what condemn because I'm controlling everything am am amen hallelujah amen this is the heritage of what the Servants of the Lord and the righteousness is of me say who the Lord this is your heritage no weapon am no demon whatever they do one Prosper don't worry about them gathering around God is under control Hallelujah glory to God fear th not for I am with thee be not what dismay for I am th God I will do what strengthen thee Joseph I will do what help Thee I will what uphold thee with my right hand of what my righteous

th God will do what will hold thy right hand say unto the Fe not I will do what I will help hallelujah how can one man control the entire Army Jesus one man look at the entire Army and say all of you follow me and they begin to follow him they never even ask who you are that's right why do we need to follow you power is not in number power is in [Music] God let let jop this my friend so I can get where I'm trying to go amen and uh verse uh 20 and it came to pass when they were coming to what Samaria that Elisha did what that Elisha said Lord Open the Eyes of this man that they may see and the Lord opened their eyes and they saw and behold they were what in the midst of Samaria and the king of Israel said to Elisha when he saw them my father shall I do what I smite them in other word Elisha brought them into an ambushed that's right and put them in the middle and when they open the house they are trapped they one that they were trying to trap trap them it only happen in D the one that you trying to destroy that Joseph will trap you somewhere am amen he will trap you somewhere he will take Simon and put him in prison amen you didn't see that when you rise against him you put yourself under his power amen because God has a purpose for him what the biggest test my friend you there amen and he answer verse 22 you shall not Smite them would you smite Those whom you have taken captive with the sword and with your bow set what bread and water before them and that they may do What eat and drink and what go to their Master do your enemy good the one who are trying to destroy you remember the biggest test is what forgive them give them bread yes sir amen listen amen amen listen to brother branam brother Bram says this he says he said would you take a prisoner to Smite him give them what something to eat and send them back to their country that is the way to do what Lord isn't that right oh my if you would only adopt that what principle today to do what feed your enemy do good to those that do what evil to you amen amen notice how these are crying out for what under the six the fifth seal the Jews are saying how long will he avenge how long will he avenge brother brandham said look at them they are crying for vengeance brother brandham said they cannot be what bride material bride turn what the cheek and cry and say what forgive them Father they know not what they do D is a place you will be Tak anywh a tri that will come that you were not prepared out of nothing you didn't do anything something suddenly take you why is it why my friend why in William Mayan Bram sometime God let the very props be knocked from under us I let that soak in so I can head to the airport he says sometime he let what sickness strike us he let what disappointments heartaches do what strike us sometime he does that to get you where you be what influenced by the gospel be what wise enough to catch don't be stupid enough to walk away from it amen I didn't use that word brother Bram said don't be stupid enough to cry in your trial a when trial are coming it's actually pushing you toward the right direction am be wise and catch the message nothing is adic God is controlling everything God is watching everything don't be afraid I am there I will help you don't be afraid I'm just directing you where you supposed to go amen amen amen amen William Mario God let what disappointments happen like Joseph to show what victory oh if we could only see that you only see that these things that seem to be what so buring you and what and upsetting you and what there are trials all that you see is how It's upsetting you how it's hurting you there are things to do what stand still Focus your what your glasses radically on what on the word of God when trial is coming refocus your glasses look at the word of God God is about to do something for you if you look a trial you'll be distracted and be sucking into hatred Focus your glasses on what the word of God and do what speak the word and then just do what walk forward that's all there is to do it amen back up my friend Amen brother Bram says this it seems like the Christian Life if the fellow is not absolutely centered on Christ the Christian life seems hold so many what disappointments but those disappointment are what are God's Divine will happening for us those disappointment those disappoint ointment leave denomination alone leave the people in denom the disappointment among the message beli am in this message those disappointment they are God's will there are God's will happening what for us now it don't seems like it will be that but it's what God's way of doing things he let us do what hit the river to see what we shall do am Joseph in Joseph in this morning I say this friend after 31 years of ministry after 31 years of TOS on the field of the field I want to make my testimony to this to what I have seen what disappointments I have seen what the time I've asked for things and cry for what for things and beg for what and Fa to get them but if you just wait how patiently upon who God then I know that it will work just exactly right it will come out just exactly right that's just exactly the what the right thing am God is pushing you toward his destination because he's the one that holds your destiny amen disappointment will come not from far off from your own brother hallelujah hallelujah that's why the Bible say there is no temptation taking you but such is what as common to man in other word what is happening to you is not super human right God cannot give you something that is super super human it is common God know you can handle it amen but God is how faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted how above that you are able a great big army for one man because God knew that one man can handle the entire Army and lead them all the way and put them in the Trap one man so the trial that seems to be big big big big big big big big big if you see a big host a big Chariot a big great host just know that you got more power so God have match you with your with the level of your power if your power is 89 just expect the devil to be no more than 89 so somebody might get 30 by you getting 89 don't cry and say they got a small I got a big one it means you A big one that's why they have to increase it yes God could not give you something greater than what you can handle you are always you will be always greater than your trial don't look Elisha say look Elijah say Elisha say listen they that are with us are more than all that you see here you are seeing the number but what I have is more than them in other words the power of Elisha is more than the power of the enemy God will never give you a trial that is more than your strength the more painful the tri the stronger you are the more he hurt it's telling you that you reach a level that the devil have to hurt you so much for you to even feel because if the devil come with a small one you tackle them easily you can just do this that's why God sent something to make you awake that you see where you are CL up a little bit more higher Jesus amen amen amen but will with the what the Temptation also make what a way to escape that you may be able to what you will always an exit have an exit every trial will always have a solution am no trial will come to you without a solution brother Steven many times every time I'm going to going to drop to the airport that a man ever done anything that is worth what anything he walk how alone with God that's it we want to keep our group
