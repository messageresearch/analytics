very very familiar scripture to us in Romans the eth chapter and maybe just before we read the word we could just buy our hearts together for a word of pray I know there's many needs Among Us in this hour let's just ask him to come by and visit with us tonight Heavenly Father Lord as your Believers have gathered here this evening on this hour that you've called and set aside Lord that they would Gather in the house of worship Lord father this is more than a social Gathering lord it's more than the Gathering of just people on a Wednesday night but Lord we believe that this is an Emmas road walk father we believe it's a Damascus Road walk we believe it's a place of change change and Lord as we come here tonight to look into your word father we're inviting you to come Among Us in a special way Lord you see these things that you've laid upon my heart and dealt with me on Lord I pray that some way somehow tonight you could help me to get myself out of the way Lord that you could come among us tonight may you be the speaker here tonight Lord may you move us aside Lord I pray for those that are maybe sick and body tonight father we rebuke the spirit of sickness in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we call for the healing virtue of Calvary Lord to flow through those sick bodies Lord for those that are bound we're asking tonight Lord you would send the delivering Angel Among Us oh God lord for those that are discourage may you send encouragement father Lord I pray if there be one empty tonight oh God may you fill them oh god with the baptism of the Holy Ghost in fire lord if there be one growing cold on you tonight Lord as your word Goes Forth Lord May there come a cold of fire up off the altar may it touch their lips oh God and they leave this meeting being able to say Lord here am I send me Lord we commit this meeting in our faithful hands forgive us of our failures forgive us of our shortcomings oh God lord change our lives by your word and we'll be sure to give thee all the praise all the honor and all the glory in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the believer says amen and amen Romans the 8th chapter and I just want to read one verse and the 11th verse the Bible here speaking says but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you yes sir I want you to catch this it's not visiting you but it's dwelling in you that's right then he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you not by his spirit that visits you but by his his spirit that dwelleth in you we ask Lord this evening to add the blessings the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this evening I want to uh just for a few moments by the help of the Lord tonight and if I if I would take a title tonight I want to speak to you for just a few moments here on we must not lose our enthusiasm we must not lose our enthusiasm now amen I want I want to begin by saying that I believe the enthusiasm of an age amen is the message of that age in other words I don't believe it's something apart from the message but I believe it's something that is the message now in 1965 brother BR preaches two very powerful sermons amen and both of them are revolving around the subject of God's quickening power the first one he preaches is the Easter seal and then he preaches it is the rising of the Sun in the message it is the Easter seal 1965 paragraph 47 he said now as Christians we all claim that he is alive or we have been quickened from the to death amen to Life by his spirit and if we haven't been quickened then we've not been made alive see now we're going to break into this subject the Lord willing and kind of teach it for a few minutes how that are we quickened and how can we be sure that this is the truth he said now this is your own life and this is my life and if this isn't the truth then what am I then what I'm fixing to say then I'm one of the most foolish people in the world he said I've give my life for something that there's nothing to and so have you but if it is the truth he said then I owe everything that I am he said I owe everything I could be to the cause of which we're standing for he said and I think that we mustn't lose our enthusiasm amen so here's a prophet who saying amen what I'm preaching is not something I'm guessing about not something I'm hoping about but it's something that I am sure amen that it is the truth and that if it is the truth amen then we must not lose our enthusiasm now I know when you mention the word enthusiasm people automatically start thinking different things amen but I want to say thank God for a prophet amen who preached a message that was a message of enthusiasm amen but he preached it from a balance on both sides 1950 he said I'd rather have amen a little enthusiasm amen than no ASM at all I'd rather have a little enthusiasm amen there no ASM at all amen just to have somebody amen get enthused about it you know amen now when I begin to think about this I think of how amen that a prophet made a very powerful declaration and announcement he said the church today amen has lost its enthusiasm he said why because it's got out of the vine it's no more being energized by the spirit he said the wells of water bubbling up into everlasting life he said they've lost that Zeal something's missing amen now God Remains the Same amen and Christ Remains the Same but his church amen has disassociated itself amen with his connection which is the vine is the spirit now you all know the Bible said that Jesus said amen that I am the vine and ye are the branches right amen I am the vine and you are the branches then the spirit amen is the is the vine amen or it is the source amen of zeal or energy amen or enthusiasm that's coming into the church now the prophet of God in 1964 spiritual Amnesia he said now have you noticed today's crop he said if you notied today what we do he said we actually we got enough God about us till we come up to the platform and we say yes maybe I better come up and now this is the experience of worldwide he said yes I better go up and stand and say well well I don't know here I am see amen what a place to be in he said there's no fire burning there's no enthusiasm he said there's not a go into it amen so there is a connection between enthusiasm amen and a desire to go forward into something let me this we are not going back amen into the shck OR to the stalk or to the tassel amen but we're going forward am we're moving into every Divine promise that God has ordained us to move into he said see and as and as an evangelist he said that just kills me to see God's people Amen in that shape amen we are supposed to be on fire now people they actually misunderstand enthusiasm the prophet of God said see people misunderstand enthusiasm they misunderstand the power of the Holy Spirit they call it a bunch of Holy Rollers they call it a bunch of people that ain't got their right mind he said they misunderstand that you had to lose what you call your right mind because you have the mind of Christ in you you can't have the mind of the world and the mind of Christ at the same time see one's carnal and the other's spiritual he that walks after the flesh is carnal but he that walks after the spirit amen is spiritual amen so I'll lose myself Amen to find the mind of God he said see so God is misunderstood that's right it's not you that's misunderstood it's the Holy Spirit making you do that that's exactly come on church it's the Holy Ghost making you do thaten that's understood he said amen they're not speaking against you amen they're speaking against him can I say this amen I I'm sorry that if it offends you amen that somebody shouts or somebody dances somebody enjoys the anointing amen amen but but really you're not offended at them amen you're offended at the holy spirit amen that's doing it through them I'm going to go prach for here amen I know sometimes people get offended amen I've had them get offended it me for preaching certain things about about the pictures in the church about the cloud or about the seven seal Amen in all reality I don't have no issue with them because they're not offended at me amen they're offended at the one who is dwelling on the inside of me because the only thing the spirit will preach amen is the message of the hour yes my brother now it's either the truth or it's not and I believe the spirit amen is taken possession of vessel who will preach the message and believers who will believe the message yes sir they're not misunderstanding you amen they're misunderstanding the Holy Ghost that's making you do it now I just Foundation here for a second amen when you look at this word enthusiasm amen it's it's got a very powerful definition it means a strong excitement a feeling it is something inspiring it is Zeal it is fervor nowen this is what God me on this brother amen is that I'm looking at a definition amen of the word enthusiasm and this is actually connected to the definition it is a belief in a special revelation of the Holy Spirit that's exactly the word enthusiasm is connected to a belief of a special Revelation amen of the holy spirit amen now in John chapter 1 the Bible says amen that Jesus chose his disciples he chose Phillip by name he said and when Phillip after he got converted amen he was all enthus see and any man when he finds Jesus and he gets saved there is an enthusiasm see you got to be born again and when you're born there's an enthusiasm Rises with that birth amen and sets the solar fire and takes all the differences away and the isms and come straight to Calvary and recognizes Christ with a burning love and a zeal amen for the lost and Fallen World brother said enthusiasm amen that will burn your heart that will make you so happy and so full of joy amen till you'll stagger like you were full amen of strong drink listen I don't believe this message come to kill the church I believe it come to resurrect the church I don't believe this message come Amen to put our fire out I believe the message come to cause our fire to burn hotter and to burn bigger yes we are not following a man's idea we are following the Vindicated Revelation that has been brought into this age by the Holy Spirit I'm talking about enthusiasm and enthusiasm goes beyond just a feeling it goes beyond just a sensation it goes beyond just an emotion even the even the dictionary testifies that enthusiasm is connected Amen to a special revelation of the Holy Spirit now now I'm the guy I'm sorry but I'm the guy that reads that part of the definition that it is a belief and special revelation of the Holy Spirit and I say now I got to go find amen the history of this word enthusiasm do you realize it it now now now listen to this it may come as a surprise to many people when they first Look up the word enthusiasm to see that its original meaning has to do with the passion for religion rather than passionate or eager interest in general it is a brief explanation of the words amen aty should clear this up now watch this enthusiasm it entered the English language around the beginning of the 17th century it was borrowed from the Greek enthus meaning inspiration or possession by God that's it oh God for the first 200 years or so it was used in English enthusiasm amen was primarily employed to refer Amen to beliefs or passions that related to religion by the beginning of the 18th century however the word begin to describe amen having strong feelings amen or interest in secular matters now watch this in just one century amen the word or the meaning of enthusiasm changed now let me just say this what is happening in the natural is also happening in the spiritual if they were losing the meaning of enthusiasm in the natural amen so where they were in the spiritual and the prophet of God said now the sincerity he said we don't have it it seems to be such a small interest it should be in the time of this Jubilee right now amen and are positive these things it should be this streetport would be buzzing like a bus all he said but we've lost the sincerity and the enthusiasm it is to receive it he said now that's the truth he said and we'll never come back until we can appreciate or get to the spot of appreciation of God making a way for us and then calling us in it Church of the Living God God made a way for us and then he called us into the way that he made and he Vindicated it to us by his spirit and by his word amen there's where our Assurance comes from listen what the prophet said what a tragedy it is to see amen the church is in that condition do you realize the prophet of God said just as Israel amen become ritualistic he said Israel was using the word and the Commandment of God he said and the church today amen they're taking things out of the Bible amen but there's no sincerity with it that's exactly right now we can prove that can I say this the message of the hour restored sincerity to the church exactly right come on the message of the hour brought the element of sincerity yes sir yes sir back into the church now you all know I'm in the message amen because we didn't even know how to come in the building that's right come on we didn't know how to come in the building until God sent a prophet who would begin to teach Church order and by teaching Church order he would show that you can't come in talk and and chewing gum and hollering back and forth but you got to create an atmosphere this amen amen can I go a step further amen they were having communion without sincerity that's ex it had become it had become great juice it had become graham crackers or or what amen but a Prophet come and said that's not that's not something to be taken lightly amen that is a that is a that is a commandment of God it is an ordinance to remember the crucifixion of our Lord and savior let me say thank God the message came and fulfilled the words of Paul when Purge out this old Heaven that you may be a new lump yes my brother that you may be a new lump as ye are unle for even Christ Our Passover amen is sacrificed for us now now when you look at this word leaven it is a mental and moral corruption it is viewed in its tendency to infect others amen Le is applied to that which though small in quantity yet by its influence amen thoroughly pervades a thing it is either in a good sense as in the parable of Matthew 13 or in a bad sense amen of a of a pernicious influence see a little leav leth a whole l so we've come to a time where we cannot just say well we can let this in and let that in and let that in amen the more you let in come on Church the more you let in that's right is the more message you're letting out that's right on now come on we let our televisions back in and now we can't even quote what a prophet said about it that's exactly right come on come on amen amen we let high heel shoes back in and now we can't even preach pain in face Jezebel no more because with high heel shoes can makeup come on I'm talking to you now and then when we start letting things in we start letting the message go out that's right because the message will not dwell where Liv has an influence that's let me say this if if we start letting Pentecostalism come back in if we start letting Pentecostalism come back in we're going to start letting the message out and it's already got oh God what can I preach it's already got to a spot we can't even quot the bride AIDS no more and we can't preach adoption and we can't preach the seven Thunders amen but you know what I say I say Purge the church I say Purge the church Purge of 11 Purge of tradition Purge of men's ideas and bring back the message of the hour bring back the Revelation yes sir amen the Bible said therefore let us keep the feast not with o 11 not with oleen and neither with a leav of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and Truth can I say this there are many things in life that we can gain and there are many things in life we can lose can I say this some things we lose affect us and some things we lose we never realize they're gone until we've lost them that's right right can I say something to you amen I truly believe there are some things that the church can afford to lose I believe that brother stepen I believe that we can afford to lose the cold the complacent and the critical I believe it I believe that we can afford to lose the formal the Busters and the fighters you know what I believe I believe we can afford to lose the doubtful the dull and the dead but we cannot afford Amen to lose our sincerity and enthusiasm we cannot afford Amen to lose our sincerity and our enthusiasm now I'm taking my text amen from Romans 8:11 and the Bible said if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you than he that raised up Christ R from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal Body by his spirit that dwelleth in you look at this word dwelleth it means to dwell in one and influence him for the good so when you allow leevan to come in leevan has the ability to influence you for the bad or to influence you for the good but when you receive the spirit of him that raised Jesus from the dead he will only influence you for the good now look what the prophet of God says see then what is quickening power amen it is God paraphrasing it is God dwelling in the soul of The Believer by the power of the Holy Spirit can I say this we are under amen the influence of quickening power now let me say God by the holy spirit amen dwelling in The Believer is a scriptural promise in 2 Corinthians 6:16 he said what agreement have the temp of God with Idols for ye are the Temple of the Living God as God has said as God has said I will dwell in them and walk in them oh Church of the Living God Amen if you'd walk in light as he is in the line you have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ put the blood on it the blood of Jesus Christ has cleansed us from all sin come on Church the spirit is not just dwelling in us but the spirit is walking us forward if the spirit dwell in them and I will walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people in Colossians 3:16 Paul says let somebody say Let Let the word of God or the word of Christ dwell in you richly in 2 Timothy 1:14 that good thing which was committed unto thee amen keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in US brother says and ashamed he says Lord we are certainly a blessed people above our thinking above our understanding for if there was a noble one among us such as some Personnel from some other country or a diplomat of some sort we would think it was so great to have such a noble person among us but today but today we have the god of Heaven he's not only among us but he's in us and he's dwelling come on he's not just among us but he's in us he said he's dwelling amen and living his life through us see it's beyond our understanding now when you start looking here at this word enthusiasm amen I find it very amazing amen that one way of interpreting or using the word enthusiasm amen is this the spirit of God within now job 328 the Bible says that there is a spirit in man and it is the inspiration of the almighty that giveth him understanding look at this word Spirit it is an impelling Prophet to utter instruction or warning so when you receive the spirit that raised him from the dead is the same spirit that possessed the prophets Was the Same Spirit that was in Jesus come on Church now watch the spirit of God is within man and he will utter instruction amen or warning to man come on now the prophet of God picks it up in John 16:13 he says how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all truth he will not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear amen that shall he speak and he will show you things to come so when he the the spirit of Truth has come when the same spirit that raised our Lord from the dead dwells in you he will be an impelling Prophet who will utter warning and instruction to those who have ears to hear now the prophet picks this up in the Revelation series he said I want you to notice the symbols of Christ in the Bible here on Earth on the earth he was a prophet do you believe that now watch what a prophet says and a prophet is the word well glory to God a prophet is the word we know that the word Prophet means a Divine interpreter of the word see the Divine word is wrote and the prophet has the Divine spirit of God within him come on church then the same spirit that was dwelling in a prophet is now dwelling in a bride come on it's changed from the prophet to the prophecy [Applause] [Music] The Same Spirit that was in Jesus was in the prophet is in the bride listen friends the pro of God said you know the prophet of the Old Testament was called God how many knew that see he was called God because he packed within him the word of God goodness gracious he packed within him the word of God thus saith the Lord see therefore the word Prophet means his interpretation isn't to be mingled with oh now we're getting somewhere when a prophet packs the word his interpretation isn't to be mingled with see he says if there be one among you who is spiritual or a prophet then I the Lord will speak to him what he says will come to pass then hear him because I am with him but if it doesn't come to pass then don't hear him I haven't sent him him see then you see the Divine interpretation of the word are y'all ready for this has to coincide with this last Revelation to the church so the Revelation coming to the church will have to coincide with what a prophet said but you see what happens when you start mingling interpretation of what a prophet said Le starts coming in come on church I know what I'm talking about amen and Le is crep in churches and it's creeping into homes it's creeping into pull pits well we might as well preach we're here and now we're getting so scared amen we don't quote brother Ram's name we don't hang the pictures up I tell you what that is that's a devil from the pits of hell I am not ashamed of the prophetic interpretation that has come in this generation with Divine Vindication come on I'm not packing Billy Graham idea I'm not packing or Robert's view I'm not packing TD J's anointing I am packing the word of thus sayith the Lord come on I have this sayith the [Applause] Lord hallelujah hallelujah God said I will dwell in them I will dwell in them and walk in them come on church now how will he dwell in you and walk in you look here in third John 1:3 for I Rejoice greatly when the Brethren came and testified are you ready for this of the truth that is in thee even as thou wst in the truth look at verse four I have no Greater Joy than to hear that my children are walking in truth brother come along and a man running from the presence 1965 and he says somehow or another I just feel we're going there's something laying right ahead for us now just remember I believe I am prophesying great Joys lay ahead goodness Church Great Joys lay ahead now watch this believe it that's right and many sadden Hearts will be made great Mysteries will be made clear are you ready for this great Mysteries will be made clear and people who are sad will be turned into Joy come on church I have just identified to you the source of the joy unspeakable and full of Glory it's not when we sing a new song it's not when a new preacher comes along it's when the revelation of the word of God is made plain in the age you're living in then Joy will return to the church well I got my joy shoes on in the house of God I'm not walking in confusion I'm not walking in men's ideas I'm walking in Revelation and I'm enthused about it I'm walking in Clarity I'm walking in understanding I'm walking in wisdom I'm walking in knowledge I'm walking in the power of the Resurrection when the Mysteries are made clear the people who are sad come on church will be turned to Joy I can take it to Malachi 4 amen and that day their hearts shall be turned to the father I can take you to Corinthians Paul said there shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord and at that day when it shall turn to the Lord the veil will be done away with see the Mysteries being revealed was a prophecy to bring a great joy in the church now you know the prophet of God said the Palmer worm he has eat away come on now he has eat away the Joy from the church in 1962 the the restoration of the Bride tree he said we find out he took away the joy see David one time lost the joy of his salvation he didn't lose his salvation he lost the joy of it see but he just cried out Lord restore to me the joy of my salvation come on church do you see what happened when the message come people were done with religion they were done with men's ideas they were done with Creeds they were done with dogmas but God behold in his word restored the joy of our salvation by revealing the Seven Seals and thundering seven Thunders and opening our eyes see then there is a connection between eating and the fruit see the Palmer worm are you with me the Palmer worm begin to eat fruit off eat the fruit of Joy off right amen but watch but the bride begins to eat God have mercy the Palmer worm eats the fruit off but as the bride begins to eat the fruit is restored come on as the Palmer worm ate the enthusiasm left the church but as the bride begins to eat Joy begins to return now come on I want to know what is she eating come on I want to know what is she eating well according to Revelation 2:17 to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Hidden mana and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth see the brother said look he said the hidden Mana is a little something special the hidden man man is a little something special what is the special is it the blessings of the Holy Ghost oh no that's for the whole congregation but the hidden Mana was a special Revelation CZ he had to teach it to others see was a little more knowledge of the scripture that he could teach others come on Church Pentecost was shouting and dancing but when a Prophet come among the church he begin to reach in there and get some of that hidden Mana well I don't I don't know what's wrong in here tonight amen but it's a devil trying to bind this meeting and I rebuke it in the name of Jesus Christ I rebuke the devil over this church I rebuke the spirit of confusion I rebuke the spirit of division I rebuke the spirit I bind it in the name of Jesus Christ and I loose the anointing of the Holy Ghost to fill Hearts bring back our joy bring back our Victory bring back our satisfaction bring back our Liberty oh I know amen I know amen I know you may have problems but you got more promises and you got problems somebody say well preacher you don't understand the church has got problems listen every church has got problems but we got more problems come on we got more problems than a man can fix but I'm going to turn it to the positive we got more promises so why am I going to waste my time on the problems when I got some problems when I got some problems I know I got them but I got promises I've got the promise of hidden manner I've got the promise of re of Revival I've got the promise of the restoration of the joy of my salvation I say Satan you may try to sink this church you may try to bind this Fellowship you may try to break this Ministry but you're too late there's a bride who has already gone beyond the veil and she's feeding on the special Revelation she's overcoming her problems she's overcoming her situations she's overcoming the sicknesses and the confusions because she's feeding on something that's giv her some enthusiasm it's giving her some Joy it's giving her some victory Hallelujah Hal hallelujah hallelujah I'm not just talking about the blessings of the Holy Ghost no sir no sir I believe in the blessings of the Holy Ghost but let's go all the way let's go all the way let's go beyond justification let's go beyond sanctification let's go beyond the baptism of the Holy Ghost let's go into the word let's go into the hidden Mana let's go where only the priest can go let's go get some shoe bread yes sir it was a special thing that hidden Mana it was a special thing see it was made for the priest that is the leaders and this man overcome but see the whole congregation got the Mana but he got a hidden special manner or a special revelation of who Jesus was and what about him and all about him can can I can I say something to you amen I hope uh I hope I'm not speaking out of term so so brother Donnie if you hear this and I'm speaking out of term forgive me bu uh just before church and when brother Steven was talking about that three-fold purpose I just received a text from brother Donnie Reagan before church and he was actually sharing with me where someone had went on a on an artificial intelligence and they spoke to the artificial intelligence and they said would you tell me the what would you tell me what William Brandon meant when he preached a sermon called Christ is the mystery of God revealed this this person asked artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence comes back and says I know who William Brandon was he was the 20th century Prophet who was prominent in the healing campaign and give the exact date of when he preached Christ is the mystery and said now this was the point of what he was trying to make and Christ is the mystery he was trying to show that Jesus Christ is the entire theme of The Bible I thought oh my God oh my God and begin to break it down begin to break it down as if we were reading the book itself can I I say this even artificial intelligence knows that this message is a special Revelation only given to the Overcomers you know what I say I don't care what you think about it I don't care what you label me I am a message believer come on Amen the artificial intelligence ain't going to out believe me and hell ain't going to out believe me I believe this manner will change our bodies [Applause] my goodness even artificial intelligence has testified that this is a special Revelation see what is it it's word it's word bread it's word bread it's perfect mana and if a man lives by it he shall never die come on Church in every age God begin to give back by Revelation what was hidden until this last day according to Revelation 10:7 a prophet will come and will reveal all the Mysteries and then the Lord will come so I say this to you tonight we are not feeding on enthusiasm but there is an enthusiasm coming from what we're feeding on come on Church there is a special revelation now now now how many has got the Holy Ghost let me see your hand you got the Holy Ghost so the spirit of God is dwelling in you now we always talk about the words got to feed us but listen what a prophet said he said if you neglect to feed that Holy Spirit the word of God so it's not just the word feeding you but it's you feeding the Holy Spirit that's on the inside of you see every word shall be by the Holy Spirit and listen if you're trying to feed it the wrong thing if it's the genuine Holy Spirit in you it will know the difference now watch here God is feeding his church how is he feeding his church by the revealing of the son of man in Luke 17:30 who is the son of man he is the word see and he comes in three sons names the son of man the son of God and the son of David but in between the Son of God and the son of David he promised to reveal himself as son of man once again not down through the church age through justification sanctification but the son of man the word and is quicker and sharper than any two-edged sword listen the son of man is Christ he is the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you are feeding on the unfailing body word you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man so let me say this the son of man is here to feed the church and as he's feeding the church he is establishing our hearts Amen in the present truth let me just say this to you you put any scripture in the Bible under consideration and you take what brother bandam taught about it and and lay it over it amen you will see it's the truth whatever he taught just lay it over that scripture and it's the truth see because it wasn't him it was the spirit of Truth when he the spirit of Truth is come he will lead you and guide you into all truth amen now now now can I just say this we have have had a prophet among us we're not looking for another one we have had a Vindicated voice among us we're not looking for another one the prophet of God said and we do have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication how many agrees we have it we're not looking for it we have it but then he comes along and says as it is in every age people let man put their own interpretation to it by Theology and they will not believe God's Divine Vindication of it that's God's interpretation and what I say what somebody else says not what I say not what somebody else says but what God has promised and what God does proves that it's God doing his own interpreting of his word now listen friends denominations have established people in misinterpreted and misrepresented views of the scripture but let me say this the Holy Ghost is here now the spirit of Truth to establish our lives in the perfect interpretation of the scriptures can I just go ahead and say it can I just get it out there the message of the hour is not cliches it's not words of memorization it's the present day power power to live a Christian Life that is worthy of the Gospel listen friends the message of the hour is the Divine or rather perfect interpretation with Divine Vindication do you realize we find the all the way back in the Old Testament in Genesis chapter 3 that there was Messianic prophecies right and the Bible said that he would put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and that shall bruise his heel now the prophet of God picks this up and he says they spoke of it in symbols and it went Plum over the top of their head and Plum under the rest of them see went under one and over the other one see by the time he arrived on the scene of time the people to whom he was sent had their own interpretation of what he was to be are y'all ready for this in their own imaginary interpretation my goodness so there's actually an imaginary interpretation but the Bible never changed he said now the Messiah had been prophesied and when he come was in such a simple way in Simplicity till the whole church group stumbled over it but listen here he said now look all those lived right in the word but they formed their own way of it and their children had accepted it in such a way that the fathers had taught it until the fathers had taught it off of the real way and they made such an organization out of it to when the spirit tried to present truth they couldn't receive it and that's the same thing today now I know what I'm talking about because imaginary interpretation has returned again and we have imagined the way God has fulfilled his word but listen church we don't have to imagine we've had a prophet Among [Applause] Us come on I know what I'm talking about amen because false Doctrine goes from one generation to the Next Generation oh well we might as well preach at me brother Craig it just keeps on going and somewhere somebody's got to stand up and have a backbone and say that's not the way the prophet taught it come on that's not the way William Brandon preached it come on if somebody don't stand up our next generation is going to be believing God only knows what come on now I know what I'm talking about oh glory to God they've already taken the pictures out of the church they've already silenced the tapes they've already laid aside the books they've already brought commentaries back in and dror so and so in this Pentecostal Revival and this revivalist let me say it as plain as I know how come back to the perfect interpretation of the message of the hour say it the way a prophet said it come on there wouldn't be imaginary interpretations about the Rapture if men hadn't made him come on somebody amen oh brother Steven is just okay amen Amen brother br's going to come back and found an airplane imaginary interpretation imaginary interpretation well brother Ra's going to come back and sit up at 10 and we're all going to follow for two years imaginary interpretation well there's seven Thunders and there's seven men that's a voice to each Thunder imaginary interpretation come on I might as well preach I'm this close to it amen they'll go as far as to say this amen that the Holy Ghost is just a feeling imaginary interpretation it's the same thing today but the spirit is here to present truth can I say this but it's going to be present day truth can I ask you all just to brother stepen I'm at home can I just can I just ask y'all a real just a real blunt question is that okay brother Greg why do we have churches who claim to be message churches who claim to follow brother B's teachings and then they have meetings and say well don't quote brother [Applause] brand why do we have preachers who claim to be message preachers and they get up and work hard not to recognize that God sent a prophet I'll tell you why is imaginary interpretation has taken the place of perfect interpretation but you know what I say I say tear down every imaginary interpretation and lift up what a prophet said come on you can shoot me you can stab me you can beat me and bang me but I'll go down saying William brandom taught it I might as well just preach I got some Liberty on me come back to the reality of the present day [Applause] truth if you're going to take a pull pit say what a prophet said preach the word of God or sit [Music] down we got marriages on the Rocks we got babies on their way to premature Graves we got mental nervousness and people playing with the greatest message [Music] it's a devil it's a devil brother B said look he said see you cannot separate God in the word they are one can I tell you what this bride will be this bride will be Spirit born spirit filled Spirit Led and word fed now I know that Devil's pushing against me right now but I really don't care cuz I I remember brother brother Greg I remember I remember the first time as just a teenager preacher on the road preaching the message and sitting in a man's office and him look at me and say now when you go in my pull pit don't mention brother br's name okay okay well well uh what are we doing here then what are we doing here then listen amen the Baptist Church will pay the bills and the Pentecostal Church will pay the bills we come out of that nonsense we come out of man's interpretation we come out of Creeds and dogmas and ritualistic oh God I ain't going back I ain't going back I ain't going back to wondering around how to preach and what to say and what to teach I'm going to stand on a rock and say what a prophet said until Liberty comes Holy Ghost Liberty and lives are changed [Applause] preach take your sir yes sir amen amen and I'm just going to I'm just going to go ahead and preach since I drove all the way out here is that okay amen can I just say this can I just can I just get it out there somebody somebody oh God somebody got up the other day and and somebody actually sent it to me some some hirling that left the message and LIF off the ties of people for years but now all of a sudden the message is wrong so he gets up and says well there ain't no move of God in the message movement well you know what I say I say that's a line devil from the the pits of Hell William Mari and brandham taught a Pentecostal experience from 1947 to 1965 and he never replaced a person receiving the indwelling of the Holy Ghost will me prove it to you by the message brother RS asked two powerful questions in 1963 the first one is would the bride of Christ have a Ministry before the Rapture sure sure sure that's what's going on right now see the bride of Christ certainly that'ss the message of the Hour come on now she's got a Ministry it's a great ministry it's the ministry of the hour but it will be so humble oh mercy so where did he bring that humility in under the third pull so the bride's Ministry was not a public show 1964 will there be a move of the Holy Spirit signs and wonders and miracles done by the bride before she goes away or are we just waiting for his appearing he says now will there be now he says wait let me get this right see will there be Miracles done by the bride yes sir it's being done right now come on Amen I'm just going to say it I rebuke every Lon devil that says by the preaching of this message Miracles can't be done that's a ly devil I've heard him with these ears say well you can't just stand up there and teach the message and read quotes and have a move of God amen amen try to tell brother Wayne Lawson that when he stood over there in Norway and preached about the Seven Stars and declared the seven star was a man named William brandham and a woman bound with leukemia said amen to it the leukemia left her body come on Church truth is truth no matter what form it's preached in if it's preached deep or simple it's still the truth come on if it's the new birth or the seventh seal it's still the [Applause] truth come on I know what I'm talking about amen amen just a few years ago I was preaching and while I was preaching Amen on the influence of the third p I was preaching down the aisle just like this brother Greg preaching down the aisle and I didn't know it amen but there was a friend of mine sitting there who has having back trouble and as I went by him I just laid my hand on him not even knowing what was wrong with him and he told me after service he said brother Andrew he said while you were preaching about the influence of the third pull he said the back pain left my [Applause] body come on Church come on you know why we're not running around hollering Jesus it's C he left denominations he left ritualistic Affairs and he come underneath a provided place of [Applause] worship well glory to God somebody shout hallelujah hallelujah preach the message preach the message my brother preach the message come on declare what a prophet said the angel of the Lord is with it now amen amen I'm I'm running out of time but but but but I'm getting here okay take your time can I your time can I say something the bride's Revival begin with the opening of the word which is the third pull which is the manifestation of those seven unknown Thunders which is opening of Seven Seals which is the divinely revealed mystery truths that were contained in those Seven Seals now in 1963 a prophet made that statement in 1963 and the word come open 1963 the word comes open and a prophet declares the revealing of the son of man the power of the word the re revelation of seven angels bringing the mystery right all those things are the opening of the word which was the igniting of the bride's Revival but right before he goes off the scene in 1965 he comes along in a sermon called ashamed and said see the Revival itself amongst the churches has died everyone knows that you feel it in this Tabernacle you feel it everywhere are you ready for this he says there is is a fum a dead feeling there is just something isn't right are you ready for this it's because the Revival enthusiasm it's because the Revival enthusiasm has gone away from the people go into the churches and you'll see them sitting there and the pastor stumbling around for a message and something other and the first thing you know he turned it off on some kind of a party they're going to have or something it seems to be a dead thump everywhere 1963 the Revival enthusiasm is already leaving the churches and a dead feeling th has come in there now now can I just say something to you I was I was sitting last night and I was just pondering over these things and I said Lord why is it that we have such a powerful message and and here we are amen amen here we are 50 60 years and we still got guys playing with it we still got churches saying things like well we need to get back to the Bible we just need to get back to preaching Christ and we just need to get back to B oh God I'm going to get in trouble sure as the world are you hearing me why is that Lord and just as plain as I'm talking to you the spirit of the Lord spoke these words to My Heart said if we lose our enthusiasm of the belief of special Revelations we will become embarrassed of them I said oh my Lord right there it is we've lost our enthusiasm of being identified by special Revelation and instead of being enthused by it we become embarrassed by it come on Church am amen we become embarrassed to say that a woman shouldn't dress a certain way and a man shouldn't act a well come on Amen but what happened is the the enthusiasm so now you got entire groups of people scared to death of Revelation well I'm not afraid of Revelation I'm not afraid of it I don't care what a man done with the word revelation I know what a prophet taught listen friends amen the devil wants us to do listen what the devil wants to do he wants to replace our enthusiasm of the message with embarrassment of the message that's why Jesus Jesus said whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation of him who also shall the son of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father with the Holy Angels Paul says Romans 1:15 he says so as much as in me is I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also that's right listen in other words he says I'm infused yes sir I'm ready to tell somebody about the pillar of fire I'm ready to preach to the Romans about the power of Christ I'm ready to tell them about my conversion well well I might as well say it amen Andrew Glover is ready to preach the message Steven Shango is ready Thomas cross is ready brother Kelly is ready we are ready to preach the revealing of the son of man because we are infused by it we're not embarrassed about it we are infused about it it's a fervor it's a Zeal it's a passion it's an ability to bring a special Revelation it ain't a burden to get up and say what a prophet said it's a blessing I'm not ashamed I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God under salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first first yes sir and also to the Greek that's right can I say this he's here he's here he's here the special Revelation is here the shoe bread is here sir the Seven Seals are open the mind of Christ is in the bride she has thus saith the Lord come on somebody the Holy Ghost is in the church quickening power is in the flesh of the mortal bodies of the Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah for the Lord God Isaiah 57 for the Lord God will help me therefore shall I not be confounded I will not be confounded therefore have I set my face like a flint and I know that I shall not be ashamed it it I know I shall not be embarrassed I know I shall not be humiliated Hallelujah now amen I've got to tie this together because what is happening in the natural yes sir is also happening in the spiritual do you realize it's an identity crisis time where there's pressure on men not to be men and women not to be women that's why you have boys going in girls' bathrooms and women going in men's bathrooms rooms because it's an identity crisis it's an age of pressure but look what a prophet said he said but the bride of Christ is not unsure of what she believes he said she is not ashamed of him see she knows he is the word so the word of God and the messenger of the age was the self same thing all the time see Jesus was the word that was prophesied of he was the word manifested so what is Christ Christ is revealed and made manifest in his own word now look here what a prophet of God says and we're inside of Christ now all True Believers see him the Word of Promise for this day openly manifested in order to do this our old denominational Veil must be rent again see then look in Luke chapter 4 aen now I'm going to tie this together okay in Luke chapter 4 the Bible says the Messiah was sitting in the temple he was there to identify himself with a Word of Promise for that age and the prophet said how could those people failed to see who he was how did they ever miss it when it was so plainly made known and showed how could they ever miss seeing it think of it this day this scripture is fulfilled see now watch the Messiah himself is standing in the presence of the congregation he's reading a word out of the Bible that's pertaining to himself and then says today this scripture is fulfilled and they fail to see it can I say this they should have been filled with enthusiasm but instead they were full of embarrassment that's right come on when Jesus picked up the scroll and turned to Isaiah and read about himself and went over and sat down and said this day this scripture is fulfilled they should have been rejoicing they should have been shouting they should have been hollering they should have been pumping their fist and saying this is him scriptures fulfilled but instead they was embarrassed now how was they embarrassed because they believed man's private interpretation imaginary imaginary interpretation blind them from seeing word manifestation what are you saying preacher I'm saying it's very popular to say I'm a Christian very popular to say oh yes I'm a Christian but do you believe the word of God where it said these signs shall follow them that believe oh even ministers faces will blush that's right Are you ashamed to say Divine Healing or the Full Gospel or your Pentecostal experience that's being ashamed of his word see that's his word made flesh in you can I can I leave you with this remember to be ashamed means you're not sure that's right brother R said if you're embarrassed so you would rather not discuss the subject now we just found out so don't get in the pull pit and mention brother br's name so you don't have to explain it to somebody that God sent a prophet because you yourself are unsure that's right so you yourself is unsure so how can you exactly right so you'd rather not discuss the subject that's right well the problem of God said how can a man who's filled with the Holy Ghost how can a man full of the power of God and the love of God in his heart talk to a man a few minutes and not mention something about the love that's in his heart that's right come on church if I'm in love with this message how can I stand in a pull pit and preach to you for a solid hour and never say nothing about it this must be the evil day that Jesus spoke of people are ashamed of the word and of the spirit of God that acts within them that's exactly right but when the truth is made plain to the people that's it God then himself reveals himself through the word amen amen amen can I Leave You Fifth people are not embarrassed by claims that are not made in the Bible claims that are not made in the Bible people are not one bit embarrassed about it but for some odd reason brother CLA they are embarrassed by claims that are made in the Bible said allil flowing through people he said blood out of their hands and women on their back in this blood and running down their shoes and raise up their shoes and pour oil out and frogs jumping out and hopping down the platform and all kinds of things like that he says they'll believe that they're not they're not embarrassed to that he said but when it comes to genuine unadulterated word of God confirmed by God it seems to even embarrass the other group on the radical side see there is an embarrassment about it are you ready for this but it's a reality it's a reality to a man or woman to a boy or girl who is really a genuine Christian when God made the promise of the Holy Spirit and you receive it there is something that settles within you it's not an emotional workup it's not some enthusiasm or some religious Doctrine or some catechism or Creed or Dogma amen but when he really comes to a place like Moses did on the backside of the desert he can walk up face to face with almighty God and you see the voice speaking to you exactly with the word of the promise of the hour there is something it does to you see see you're not ashamed of it it does something to you can I tell you what it does to you it restores the joy of your salvation Hallelujah the preaching of the message of the hour is the restoring of the Salvation to the Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah yes hallelujah what are you saying I'm saying the word sir is the identification upon the church hallelujah hallelujah let me say what a prophet said he says see this modern church is embarrassed see this modern Church neither does she wanted them hear screaming shouting tongue speaking acts 238 young ons around her yeah see she don't want of them whooping crying screaming amen and Hallelujah why such a child would immediately put her out of her [Music] denomination can I say this yes sir you were carrying Christ and you had to birth him so it put you out the birth of the word put you out so you see she she's pregnated with something cuz she's bringing forth members all the time but she don't want none of them screaming hollering blabbering acts 238 miserable creatures she thinks they are it would certainly embarrass her it would ruin her and her educated ethical scientific Society Church that she belonged to they would throw her out at the next Council she can't have it so she don't want to be pregnated with the word because that's the only kind that's it that's the only kind that the word that the word can bring forth born of the spirit of God it has the spirit of God in it won't you stand your feet tonight and give God [Applause] praise we must not lose our enthusias can I say this Paul was not embarrassed of his conversion on the on the road down to Damascus he come in presence contact with God an angel come down from heaven in a form of a pillar of fire a light struck him on the ground he raised up and said Lord who are you and he said I am Jesus now listen standing before a grippa he repeated the story again he said I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ for it is the power of God un salvation sir to everyone that believes he said see a man who once come in contact with God which is the word and the word has been made plain and manifested to him there is no shamess about that you're not embarrassed it oh I could shout on this quote it don't embarrass me to say I believe every word of God it don't embarrass me when the Lord says to say anything you go say it and do it it don't embarrass me to say that I've been filled with the Holy Ghost it don't embarrass me to say that I spoke with other tongues it don't embarrass me to say that the Lord has showed me Visions it don't embarrass me to say the same yesterday today and forever God help us not to be ashamed but help us to be a living testimony any disciple of Christ who has come in contact with him in Redemption and salvation has come into his heart he is a possessor of God amen and what kind of life should we live how should we walk how should we talk if God is representing himself through our own mortal bodies who could be ashamed of that we've been given a duty Church brother said if I was come to a place I was on the police force here in Jeffersonville and I walked down the street and all the authorities I wouldn't be ashamed of the city I wouldn't be he said I'd be a part of the city I would be a police a part of the the city to keep order and conduct I found my place in the message brother Ste listen what a prophet of God said you say you found your place yeah I found my place you say to keep order and conduct no a prophet said I'm a part of the city I'm a part of the city see the reason why when the United States of America National Anthem is played something moves you is because you're a part of it come on somebody you know why you're moved when the prophet of God's name is mentioned and the Revelation begins to come and the quotes begin to be read is because you're a part of it it's who you are to be embarrassed of this message is to be embarrassed of who you are you are a part of the word of God you're a part of the New Jerusalem I'm not ashamed of the city I'm not ashamed to be a police officer no sir he said if a man run a red light I wouldn't be ashamed to tell him he done wrong and give him a ticket that's my duty because I'm getting paid by the city I'm living by the city I have the authority from the city no matter if he was drunk what the matter was with him they'll back me up I stand my grounds C I'm a policeman I'm ordained or put in here and given authority to do this you're supposed to take the law and rights and things and see that it's done right now we've had a lot of guys try to take the position as the police of the message and they're going to keep order and they're going to keep conduct and they're going to straighten this out and they're going to straighten that out they're going to fix this and they're going to clarify that amen but can I just tell you how you fix problems you ready preach the message if I'm a Christian and filled with this wearing the testimony of Jesus Christ he's the same yesterday today and forever don't let any devil push you around we have authority by the resurrection of Jesus Christ listen friends I don't know about you tonight but I think it's time yes sir I think it's time to stand on what a prophet taught used to be an old brother I used to have a saying he'd say it's time to get in get out or get run over cuz we're going on you say brother Andrew that's hard is it really you're called to this word you're called Don't Lose Your Enthusiasm don't lose your Zeal don't lose your fervor don't allow the devil to change the special Revelations of this message you got a lot of problems but you got more promises got a lot of ridicules you got more Revelation can I say this the Church of the Living God will move forward I tell you when a person loses their enthusiasm brother Stephen the first time is everything it's wrong in the church right all of a sudden they see it all of a sudden they see it it's been there for four years five years 10 years 20 years but as soon as they lose their enthusiasm they see this problem and that problem and he said that and she done this and she done that I'll show you something you can check somebody you can check their meter real quick quick you can check where they're at okay cuz the first row turns into the third row that's it and then the third row turns into the fifth row and then the fifth row turns in the back row and then the back row turns into the back door and then the back door turns into group text and did you see did you hear did [Music] you it's all because you quit eating see as long as you was feeding the Holy Ghost none of those things [Music] matter but the minute you quit feeding the Holy Ghost the word this problem that problem this sister that brother this preacher that but see if the spirit that raised Jesus from the dead if it dwell in you it will Quicken your mortal body so you'll still be mortal but you'll be living above the promise SS around you Hallelujah still got all the problems still got all the situations but down on the inside of your soul there is a life of the power of God and it keeps your eyes above the promise you know what I say I say let's get back to eating the message let's get back to eating the tapes come on church I'm talking to you tonight it's a spirit it's a Spirit I've seen it before it's a spirit and it starts stopping on the feet of the message and the revelation of the word and starts feeding on the problems and he misquoted this and he miss said that and he preached too long and she sung Too Loud come on they didn't give me that position that one got F amen amen but but but are we Christians are we a church time my brother are we a church take your time are we the bride of Jesus Christ take your time then stand on the revelations that had been brought in this message come on get back to where you oh God that's it that's it that's it I don't know why this just come to me but I just remember it is the Holy Ghost I just remember the funny story one time we was out my me and my me and my great-grandfather and we we was out one time and we was out at a restaurant eating I think it might have been Hardies or McDonald's or something and Grand D took me in there we sitting there and I was just a little boy and we're sitting around the table and I never will forget it brother Thomas all of a sudden this guy come in and he was holling screaming kicking stuff around making the office bunch of racket noise you ever seen I mean just causing an awful commotion you know and and granddaddy bless his heart he's gone on to Glory now I never forget it we're sitting there eating and I'm just watching this guy I mean I'm watching every move he makes and everything he does and he goes over the counter and sister he starts pounding on the counter and you done you know let him have it and I'm just watching all this and he gets done he goes out the door and brother I looked over Granddaddy and I said granddaddy did you see that he said no he said the quarter pounder is too good take your time I said take your time how did you miss that it was so noticeable but that food was too good glory the food was too good next time somebody calls you on the phone and points out this problem and points out that situation and did you hear this did you see that just say no that food is too was too good the Revelation was too rich the anointing was too powerful the blood was too strong the authority of God was too great I'm sorry the food was too good Hallelujah the seventh Seal's too good the third pulls too good the only time you saw that is when

bringing it and spoken words sew up and eat it you're close to a body change you're going to eat your way out don't look at the problem don't look at the situation let people do what they got to do
