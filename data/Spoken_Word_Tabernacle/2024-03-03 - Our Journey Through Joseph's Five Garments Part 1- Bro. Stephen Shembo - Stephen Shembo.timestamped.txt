[0:00] for my eyes I couldn't do it now by his
[0:03] grace I'm tied to him the one that said
[0:07] like he did in the days of Moses I am
[0:11] Moses you know he had an absolute when
[0:14] he was down there he had all the
[0:15] theology a man could have and he tried
[0:18] hard he was a military man he looked out
[0:21] the windows and by faith
[0:24] listen now remember by faith Moses
[0:29] esteemed the Repro of Christ greater
[0:31] riches than the treasures of Egypt he
[0:33] had faith in what he was doing he
[0:36] absolutely believed it he know that he
[0:38] was raised up for that purpose but he
[0:41] failed he went out to raise sheep and he
[0:45] failed but one day back on the back side
[0:48] of the desert he come to an absolute he
[0:51] come to a place where he met something
[0:53] that was real that was a bush on fire he
[0:56] didn't want to take the leaves and go
[0:57] down to the laboratory to see the reason
[0:59] they they didn't burn he just sat down
[1:02] by take off your shoes Moses I'll go
[1:05] down and ask my pastor what about this
[1:07] he didn't have time to do that he must
[1:09] take off his shoes and when he heard in
[1:13] there there was a the word of the Living
[1:16] God that was in that bush I am that I am
[1:23] I remember my promise that I made with
[1:25] Abraham I remember my Covenant and I've
[1:28] come down to deliver them
[1:31] now then he had an absolute he was tied
[1:35] to that as long as he lived and it took
[1:37] him to Heaven he was tied to that
[1:40] absolute no matter what any of the
[1:42] theologians said he didn't need anybody
[1:44] to explain it to him he noted he had met
[1:48] God and the voice that big Pillar of
[1:52] Fire at let him through the Wilderness
[1:54] and plong to the promised land that
[1:56] Pillar of Fire in there had a voice in
[1:58] it and that voice was a voice voice of
[2:00] God that Vindicated the word amen I hope
[2:03] you're not asleep now notice that pillar
[2:07] ofar spoke the word and Vindicated to
[2:10] make it sure he quoted the scripture I
[2:13] am the god that made the promise to
[2:16] Abraham I'm the one that's what's the
[2:19] matter with Israel that's what's the
[2:20] matter down there I remember my promise
[2:23] and I've come down to see that it's done
[2:26] God only uses man to work with he
[2:29] doesn't use our organizations he doesn't
[2:31] use Machinery he could have done it but
[2:33] he chose a man that's right he could
[2:35] chose the Stars the wind or anything to
[2:37] preach the gospel but he chose man he
[2:39] does not change himself he always the
[2:41] same he chose blood for salvation
[2:44] education and nothing else will ever
[2:45] take his place blood is a God's
[2:47] appropriate way for salvation that's
[2:49] true now I want you to notice he can't
[2:52] change 20 he talk to Moses he said Moses
[2:56] I'm sending you down there but before
[2:58] you go I want to prove to you you that I
[3:00] am God said what you got in your hand
[3:02] there said a stick said throw it down
[3:04] and it turned into a serpent he picked
[3:06] it up again and come back a stick oh
[3:08] when Moses come to the place where the
[3:10] impersonator raised
[3:13] up trying to impersonate when he threw
[3:16] his rod down and said here a pharaoh
[3:18] I'll show you what God told me to do
[3:20] I'll throw this rod down watch it turn
[3:22] to a serpent and then Pharaoh said I've
[3:24] got them guys too my denomination can
[3:27] produce that so they come over and some
[3:30] impersonators what did Moses do he stood
[3:33] right there why he had met God he know
[3:36] that was God he had done his part it's
[3:38] God's time to move then he stay right
[3:41] there the Bible said the same thing we
[3:43] repeat in the last days for as jamers
[3:45] and jamus with stood Moses it's true but
[3:48] he stood there then he saw the hand of
[3:52] God come down and that snake goed up the
[3:53] rest of them did you ever notice what
[3:55] become of them sticks they were in the
[3:57] belly of this one stick Moses led the
[4:00] children of Israel through the
[4:01] Wilderness with that same stick with all
[4:03] them snakes inside of it
[4:28] again

[47:08] not even on Monday I mentioned that last
[47:11] Sunday we clear so now let's stand and
[47:15] go to our
[47:21] scripture if you have any question I
[47:24] will tell you remember that sermon I
[47:25] mentioned that on Sunday we clear am
[47:30] clear amen glory to God praise be to the
[47:35] name of the
[47:43] Lord all is well let's go to Isaiah
[47:48] 46 verse
[47:54] 9
[48:05] Isaiah 46 verse 9 if you dare you can
[48:09] say amen
[48:24] amen verse n the Bible
[48:28] says
[48:29] [Music]
[48:30] remember the former things of
[48:34] old so God want you to remember what
[48:38] happened before that's why the scripture
[48:40] even says that the Old Testament was
[48:43] written for our example and God is
[48:46] saying here remember the former thing of
[48:49] hold
[48:51] amen for I am
[48:54] God amen hallelujah and there is none
[49:01] else you might be seated so God is
[49:05] God one and only amen amen and there is
[49:09] no one that is like him there is no
[49:13] other God there is no other president
[49:17] there is no Prophet noet that can be
[49:19] compared to God no one
[49:22] else he's unique he's
[49:26] he's the top of
[49:28] everything I am God and there is none N
[49:33] El
[49:34] amen I am God and there is none like
[49:40] [Applause]
[49:45] me and we also know that the brde is
[49:50] him and the husband and the wife are
[49:54] one so if the there is no one like God
[49:58] there is also no one like the
[50:02] bride when I say God you will say Amen
[50:05] when I say the brde then you start
[50:07] thinking
[50:09] twice she is
[50:11] [Applause]
[50:13] him man shall leave the the father and
[50:18] mother and shall cling to the what and
[50:20] the two will become what and God is also
[50:23] male and female amen so God and his wife
[50:26] are what so if God there is no one like
[50:30] him what about the brde of
[50:35] God do you believe it glory to God
[50:40] hallelujah he says there is none else
[50:42] like me amen I am God and there is none
[50:46] like me amen how is this
[50:51] God this God that have no one that can
[50:56] be compared to him how is this God what
[51:00] is the characteristic of this God that
[51:03] makes him
[51:05] unique that make him different than
[51:08] anyone else that makes him
[51:12] special what makes him
[51:15] special what makes him different what
[51:18] makes him
[51:21] unique what is
[51:23] it verse 10
[51:26] he's a
[51:28] god
[51:30] declaring the
[51:32] end yes from the
[51:38] beginning the end of your life God sees
[51:43] it before your
[51:47] beginning what makes this God special is
[51:51] before even the story is finished God
[51:54] can tell you about the
[51:57] story before
[52:00] tomorrow God can tell you what's going
[52:02] to happen
[52:03] tomorrow and once he speak nothing will
[52:08] de
[52:09] deviate from what he spoke
[52:14] am in other word glory to
[52:18] God in other
[52:20] word God has the full movie
[52:27] amen before the movie
[52:32] start is my Bible different than yours
[52:35] God has the full
[52:38] drama God has your entire life
[52:43] amen before you even
[52:47] begin that's why he can declare the
[52:51] end he can tell your end before you even
[52:55] stop start he can tell you who's going
[52:57] to win am before the race start amen so
[53:03] if you go to God and you talk to him
[53:05] about the race he can pull something
[53:07] aside and say do you see the winner and
[53:10] you are assured that no matter who's
[53:13] running even if the winner that God told
[53:16] you seems to be the last one running
[53:20] just be assured that one will be the
[53:22] winner amen because God said
[53:25] amen
[53:27] [Applause]
[53:31] yes what are you trying to say Pastor
[53:34] what I'm trying to say is the full
[53:39] movie of your
[53:43] life
[53:45] amen is in the
[53:48] hand of God am that's
[53:53] right amen amen and this movie is there
[53:58] before you even start the movie
[54:04] am that's why God could make such a
[54:10] statement when he was talking to
[54:13] Jeremiah God says that before I do what
[54:17] formed thee where in the belly so you
[54:21] existed before Mom and Daddy met amen
[54:24] amen
[54:26] when your father was in high school you
[54:29] already were
[54:30] [Applause]
[54:33] somewhere when Mama was in another city
[54:37] you were already existing somewhere
[54:40] that's right amen are we
[54:42] together the Bible says that before I
[54:45] formed thee in the belly I did what
[54:50] KN this knowing is not what you think
[54:55] okay brother okay everybody okay because
[54:58] the Bible say many should come in my
[55:01] name oh my and say Lord Lord have we not
[55:06] prfi in your
[55:08] name have we not done many miracle in
[55:10] your name and God say I never knew
[55:14] [Music]
[55:15] you but when it comes to Jeremiah God is
[55:19] saying I already knew
[55:21] [Applause]
[55:23] you there are some people that are not
[55:26] known by God oh my God
[55:29] Amen this knowing is not intellectual
[55:33] knowledge sir sir God knows about who's
[55:37] preaching God knows about who's doing
[55:39] miracle but there Ison another knowing
[55:43] amen amen that you can work for God you
[55:47] can do whatever you want to do for God
[55:49] and God say I never knew
[55:52] you but there is somebody that even
[55:55] before you are born God already knew
[55:59] [Applause]
[56:02] [Music]
[56:03] you it is good to be known by God
[56:08] amen amen even if the pastor don't know
[56:12] you but as long as God knows
[56:15] you even if no one knows you even if you
[56:20] are not popular in this message that's
[56:22] not the problem the problem is that God
[56:25] knows you
[56:27] amen
[56:30] hallelujah because if God knows you he
[56:33] has your
[56:34] movie if God knows you he has your life
[56:38] if God knows you there is nothing in
[56:41] your life that surpasses
[56:44] God even the mistake you
[56:48] [Applause]
[56:53] make are we pushing the right gears yes
[56:56] we are we claming good yes sir he says
[56:59] to Jeremiah he said before I formed thee
[57:02] in the belly I did what knew thee and
[57:06] before that came forth out of the womb I
[57:09] did what sanctify the how can you
[57:12] sanctify somebody who di even come up
[57:14] from the
[57:17] womb he gave John the Baptist the Holy
[57:21] Ghost before John was born

[57:29] Bible says I did what orain thee a
[57:32] prophet unto what the nation so your
[57:34] calling is before even your parent get

[1:13:01] everybody hearing me okay yes Roman
[1:13:05] 28 uh not 8 verse 28 you there amen
[1:13:11] let's read it
[1:13:13] together you know this Bible you can
[1:13:15] read it you thought you got everything
[1:13:18] and when we read it's something new now
[1:13:20] let's read it based on what we read in
[1:13:22] Isaiah the Bible
[1:13:24] says and we
[1:13:27] know that some
[1:13:33] things even when you go to the barber
[1:13:41] shop oh you don't go to the barber shop
[1:13:46] okay man goes to the barber shop even
[1:13:49] when you go to the saloon let's balance
[1:13:52] that up
[1:13:55] all things do what work together for bad
[1:14:00] no sir for what
[1:14:06] goodus so whatever is happening in your
[1:14:12] life even though some of the stuff that
[1:14:16] happen in your
[1:14:17] life looks
[1:14:20] bad but there are for your good
[1:14:25] amen
[1:14:27] amen amen are we together amen are we
[1:14:31] together amen the Bible says that all
[1:14:35] things work together for what good not
[1:14:39] to
[1:14:40] everybody remember there is a knowing
[1:14:42] and a knowing you must be known by God
[1:14:46] if you are known by God then everything
[1:14:50] in your life God has the movie amen so
[1:14:53] I'm talking about the Royal Seed of
[1:14:56] Abraham are we together the Bible says
[1:14:59] we know that all things work together
[1:15:02] for what good to them that do what love
[1:15:07] God we already went through that love of
[1:15:09] God not everybody love of love God
[1:15:12] that's right the love of God means
[1:15:14] something else because it's God who put
[1:15:16] the love in
[1:15:17] you even if you go to church it doesn't
[1:15:20] mean you love God because the Bible say
[1:15:23] if you love me keep my
[1:15:26] commandment do you think everybody that
[1:15:28] goes to church keep the Commandment of
[1:15:29] God because some don't have the love of
[1:15:33] God that's the trth can I
[1:15:36] continue God is love so the love of God
[1:15:40] is God
[1:15:43] himself so everything is good to those
[1:15:46] that have God that's correct am am am am
[1:15:51] to the Gods
[1:15:54] is is
[1:15:57] brother okay he says all things work
[1:16:00] together good to them that do what love
[1:16:03] God to them who are the
[1:16:06] what according to what his purpose so
[1:16:10] God has a purpose amen and there are
[1:16:13] people that are associated with that
[1:16:15] purpose am and whoever is associated
[1:16:19] with that purpose that plan that project
[1:16:23] that agenda of God everything in your
[1:16:29] life every pressure in your
[1:16:32] life every trial in your life work
[1:16:36] together for
[1:16:39] [Applause]
[1:16:41] good so when you pressurizing me it's
[1:16:44] going to work for good
[1:16:50] [Music]
[1:16:51] am amen
[1:16:54] even the traffic on the
[1:16:59] road even the traffic that you see on
[1:17:01] the
[1:17:02] road sir yes sir you need to see God
[1:17:06] everywhere you need to see God
[1:17:08] everywhere in your
[1:17:10] life even the house that you living in
[1:17:13] God already knew
[1:17:15] amen it somebody's in
[1:17:19] tune are we
[1:17:22] together the Bible says in verse 29 for
[1:17:26] whom he did what for no do you see that
[1:17:30] whom he did what for no he also did what
[1:17:33] predestinate to be what conformed to the
[1:17:36] image of his son that he might be the
[1:17:38] what the first born of among what many
[1:17:42] Brethren so we have a stature of a
[1:17:45] perfect man and God is producing
[1:17:48] children to look like the stature of a
[1:17:50] perfect man so that at the end all of us
[1:17:53] look like him am and there is nobody
[1:17:57] like me am because there is nobody like
[1:18:00] God and we are God
[1:18:05] [Applause]

[1:18:16] up lat amen this time it's your soul to
[1:18:19] say amen amen I'm not talking to the
[1:18:22] brain I'm talking to souls Souls of the
[1:18:25] Living God elects of God before the
[1:18:28] foundation of the world those that God
[1:18:32] predestinated that God
[1:18:34] forne that God purpose amen that God
[1:18:37] plan am that God associated in his
[1:18:41] hidden agenda that's the one I'm talking
[1:18:46] about for those people everything yes
[1:18:49] sir in your life work together for good
[1:18:52] am
[1:18:57] everybody okay verse 30 moreover who
[1:19:01] whom he did what predestiny what a
[1:19:05] package them he did what also called so
[1:19:08] before you are called you must be what
[1:19:10] predestinated so when you are called it
[1:19:13] means what predestin so if God calls you
[1:19:16] you automatically have to include in
[1:19:18] your agenda that I have been
[1:19:19] predestinated amen amen everybody okay
[1:19:23] amen and him who call he did what also
[1:19:26] justify do you know what justify means
[1:19:28] right it means you
[1:19:30] what justify and him he also what
[1:19:33] Justified he also did what glorified
[1:19:36] what shall we then say to what these
[1:19:39] things if God be for who us who shall be
[1:19:43] what against us so there are certain
[1:19:45] people that God have for for them
[1:19:51] am
[1:19:54] am that's why Paul say is there any
[1:19:56] Injustice in God he said God forbid but
[1:19:59] there are certain people that God are
[1:20:02] for
[1:20:04] them if they ever in trouble God leave
[1:20:07] everything he said not that one some
[1:20:10] other people God say that don't belong
[1:20:13] to him go ahead and who
[1:20:15] him but if it's their children if it's
[1:20:18] the children of God even if he's
[1:20:21] whooping he's watching say the devil
[1:20:23] not too much decrease decrease not this
[1:20:26] one HH go ahead whoop him in the back
[1:20:30] okay but don't put any scar on him okay
[1:20:32] okay slowly Go Gentle on
[1:20:35] him because not this one this one if you
[1:20:39] continue too much I who you

[1:20:46] to whoop Israel and he turn around and
[1:20:49] whoop
[1:20:51] Babylon
[1:20:54] so when the Babylonian are coming

[1:20:58] God is watching when they exaggerate God
[1:21:01] turn around and begin to whoop them in

[2:05:03] the
[2:05:05] woman they just sh the woman to him he
[2:05:09] didn't want her so there is no true love
[2:05:12] what do you

[2:05:17] that
[2:05:21] friend we have a big God our brain are
[2:05:24] too tiny to comprehend the mysteries of
[2:05:28] God but God see fit to open them to you

[2:14:06] said not you it's going
[2:14:12] to the Bible says that for Judah did
[2:14:16] what prevailed above his Brethren of him
[2:14:19] came what the chief ruler
[2:14:21] [Music]
[2:14:23] but but the what Birthright was who
[2:14:27] Joseph because from the beginning he
[2:14:29] belongs to him Joseph
[2:14:34] [Music]
