[41:33] grace to approach couple important uh
[41:37] question on music and that helped me uh
[41:40] cover the last part of music so I call
[41:43] that music part three
[41:45] so it was one hour and 34 minutes and 21
[41:50] seconds
[41:51] so if you put music part one music part
[41:55] two music part three it gives you almost
[41:58] 7.9 which is eight hours sermon
[42:02] everybody okay yesterday we talk about
[42:05] the dancing
[42:06] we believe in dancing but there is the
[42:09] right kind of dancing and we set up the
[42:12] tune for your uh reception in this
[42:14] church if you want to uh celebrate how
[42:17] do you celebrate with a Christian song
[42:19] how do you celebrate god with a dancing
[42:21] what is the purpose of you dancing amen
[42:24] so that's what I want I know some of you
[42:26] are not here but pray so that the Lord
[42:29] will allow me to release those tapes so
[42:31] you can go back at home and pick up your
[42:33] Bible and get the message of the hour
[42:35] and verify everything that I gave you
[42:38] because you have nothing to do with my
[42:40] culture
[42:41] with my origin with any country but I
[42:45] gave you the word from the scripture and
[42:47] the word from the prophet in other words
[42:49] in every country whatever I have
[42:52] delivered it will help you distinguish
[42:54] between a correct Christian music and
[42:57] what is not correct amen I'm saying that
[43:00] because I'm I'm seeing a lot of
[43:02] foolishness online is my microphone okay
[43:06] okay I can't hear myself back here amen
[43:09] amen it is the devil I know what is
[43:12] coming up
[43:14] amen you know what let me let you sit a
[43:17] little bit if something is wrong you
[43:19] want me switch
[43:20] okay
[43:22] praise God
[43:25] praise God
[43:27] so he's in trouble
[43:29] amen
[43:31] I was saying that I've seen a lot of
[43:33] foolishness that are going on and the
[43:35] devil has been using the door of Music
[43:38] especially in the message and that's the
[43:41] door he's using more to bring worldiness
[43:43] amen so if you don't want to Spirit in
[43:45] your house or in your house on your
[43:47] husband or your wife Mama watch the
[43:50] music you're listening to Daddy watch
[43:53] the music you're listening to young
[43:55] people be careful what kind of music
[43:57] you're listening to amen if we want to
[44:00] celebrate we have a wedding we have a
[44:02] birthday it's okay to use music but you
[44:05] gotta know which music we use because
[44:07] yesterday we gave you the guideline if
[44:10] you open your door to be listening to
[44:13] anything you're going to be responsible
[44:15] for spirit and you will wonder why our
[44:17] kids struggling with certain spirit
[44:19] because all of those Spirits are coming
[44:22] through the channel of music I'm not
[44:24] talking about secular music I'm talking
[44:26] about what we call Christian music if
[44:29] you have a problem I have part one part
[44:32] two part three that I explain everything
[44:34] so before God I have done my job and
[44:37] it's your responsibility to make sure
[44:40] you stay in line with what the word of
[44:43] the hour say and the Holy Scripture amen
[44:46] so he has nothing to do with your
[44:48] country everything comes from the word
[44:51] and the prophet and when I'm pulling
[44:53] something from the scripture and from
[44:56] the message of the hour I will never
[44:58] back up
[45:00] I don't know if you get me if something
[45:03] that I'm presenting is coming from the
[45:05] Bible and the message of the hour I
[45:07] would not even Dodge from one inch I
[45:10] will remain with it because I know I'm
[45:13] responsible as a Shepherd to stand for
[45:15] the word and to make sure everybody is
[45:18] protected under the word because the
[45:21] word is a fortification and the word is
[45:24] our protection if I let down the bar
[45:26] then it's going to be a problem Amen
[45:28] brother Branham say music it's another
[45:31] way of preaching the gospel so every
[45:33] time you open your door to a music you
[45:36] are listening to a gospel
[45:38] and you won't want me to come here and
[45:40] preach Baptist Doctrine

[47:26] they're going to be the head of the
[47:27] family amen so we can meet together and
[47:31] talk I believe I got everything covered
[47:33] by the grace of God so let's go ahead to
[47:35] our scripture this morning
[47:46] so Brother David should I remove this
[47:49] completely okay so
[47:52] give me a minute and we go from there
[47:55] it's uh
[47:57] Genesis chapter 2.
[48:31] somebody's witnessing how I'm removing
[48:33] the armor
[48:36] but I got another one a slingshot
[48:41] amen
[48:43] we built a lot
[48:47] through theophany a lot of things to
[48:51] reach this point
[48:53] so
[48:55] if you have been consistent with the
[48:57] sermon you will pick up quickly and we
[49:00] will move on everything that we were
[49:02] building we were coming to this point
[49:05] amen so make sure you stay alert
[49:08] and everything will be okay Genesis
[49:11] chapter 2 verse 21 if you dare you can
[49:14] say Amen
[49:17] the Bible says
[49:19] and the Lord God you remember this now
[49:22] cause a deep sleep
[49:25] to fall upon Adam we know Christian
[49:28] don't die
[49:29] they sleep in other words Adam was
[49:33] almost put to death
[49:36] in tap he was put to death
[49:38] everybody okay
[49:40] and he slept
[49:42] and he took one of his ribs
[49:45] and close up the flesh instead thereof
[49:49] and the rib which the Lord God has taken
[49:52] from man made he a woman and brought her
[49:57] to the man you might be seated
[50:00] so before God
[50:04] begin to manufacture
[50:07] or to create Eve
[50:09] God took a rib
[50:13] everybody okay
[50:14] and this rib is a portion
[50:18] or a part
[50:21] of Adam
[50:25] amen
[50:26] so if
[50:29] started from Adam
[50:33] we already built a whole lot amen
[50:36] in other words the building block
[50:41] the building block
[50:44] or the foundation
[50:49] or the very beginning
[50:52] of Eve
[50:54] if started as a part of Adam
[50:59] everybody okay
[51:00] if I can call if I make a rib like this
[51:04] amen this is a portion of Adam
[51:07] amen everything that surrender this rib
[51:12] amen
[51:14] that's what made Eve
[51:17] but the beginning of Eve inside the eve
[51:22] at the very bottom of Eve there is a
[51:25] part of Adam
[51:29] so when you look at if she's a woman but
[51:32] inside of Eve there is a part of Eve
[51:35] that belonged to Adam
[51:40] everybody okay
[51:42] everybody okay so Eve have a part of
[51:45] Adam
[51:46] put inside of her
[51:48] [Applause]
[51:52] if it's not completely woman
[51:55] she has a part of a male
[51:58] that was put into her
[52:04] everybody okay
[52:06] glory to God
[52:11] verse 20 3 the Bible say and Adam said
[52:17] this is now water bone of my bones Adam
[52:20] said that when he woke up
[52:23] because he was put asleep so there is a
[52:27] death of Adam in type and then Adam was
[52:31] resurrected amen when Adam resurrected
[52:34] and when Adam looked at Eve amen they
[52:39] resurrected Adam
[52:43] look like they fabricated Eve
[52:50] let me start it again
[52:52] after God finished to create Eve
[52:56] amen God created Eve in reference to
[53:01] Adam
[53:05] everybody okay so if Adam is human
[53:09] Eve must be human
[53:11] if Adam is a bird
[53:13] Eve must be a bird
[53:15] everybody okay because Adam said that
[53:18] this is now Flesh of My Flesh because
[53:21] Paul says that we have different flesh
[53:24] you remember that in First Corinthians
[53:26] we have a flesh for the bird a flesh for
[53:28] this and a flesh for human but when Adam
[53:31] look at Eve he look at the flesh the
[53:33] material of Eve he said wait a minute
[53:35] another word this time I can see
[53:39] I mean a specie
[53:42] a creature that look exactly like me
[53:47] amen she is born of my born and she's
[53:52] Flesh of My Flesh in other words from
[53:55] inside
[53:59] Bond
[54:02] s are invisible
[54:05] you can see them through the skin
[54:09] unless the car wreck then we can see the
[54:11] bones amen they are inside and then the
[54:14] flesh
[54:15] is what you see outside
[54:17] amen so when Adam woke up the inside of
[54:23] evil
[54:26] are we together there is two part of you
[54:28] that need Redemption
[54:31] I'm building up okay the inside of you
[54:34] of Eve and the outside of Eve look
[54:39] exactly like Adam that's why Adam say
[54:42] this is now born of my bone and this is
[54:45] now Flesh of My Flesh in other words 100
[54:48] this woman look just like me in other
[54:52] words this woman is me in a feminine
[54:56] version
[54:57] [Applause]
[55:00] amen so this woman was just me
[55:05] and me and this woman we are
[55:08] any question
[55:09] let's go to Roman chapter 8.
[55:15] like I said everything we built on God
[55:18] is male and female they did all of that
[55:21] together we coming to this point
[55:24] amen
[55:25] yeah these are not sermon that you
[55:27] preach one time and you get everything
[55:29] you're going to see a quote then the
[55:31] court will cause you problem to for
[55:33] another coat and things like that so you
[55:35] got to build it up completely until you
[55:37] get to this point
[55:38] so the inside
[55:41] and the outside
[55:45] must look the same like Adam amen when
[55:49] Adam woke up when I'm saying when Adam
[55:52] woke up in tap Adam was put to sleep
[55:55] which mean death then Adam was
[55:57] resurrected
[55:59] everybody okay so the way Adam looked
[56:02] after his resurrection
[56:07] are we okay
[56:08] the way Adam looked
[56:11] after the resurrection after his
[56:15] Awakening
[56:16] or after his resurrection
[56:20] amen is exactly the way Eve was
[56:29] Amen in other words if Adam woke up and
[56:33] he's an angel Eve must be an angel
[56:35] because Eve must be born of born and
[56:37] flesh of Flesh in other words Eve must
[56:40] be identical
[56:41] to Adam
[56:43] he must look like Adam he must be like
[56:46] Adam
[56:47] only in a female version
[56:50] the only the only difference is one is
[56:54] male and another one is female
[56:57] but when you have male and female you
[56:59] put them together then they wanna
[57:02] are we okay
[57:03] Romans chapter 8 verse one uh verse 11.
[57:07] if you dare you can say amen amen glory
[57:10] glory
[57:13] but if the spirit
[57:16] of him that raise up Jesus from the dead
[57:20] when we talk about Adam this is in tap
[57:24] that was the first Adam we got the
[57:26] second and the last Adam and that Adam
[57:28] is the Lord Jesus Christ
[57:30] and we know that Jesus took his bread
[57:32] with him on Calvary and just like God
[57:35] Pierce Adam God Pierce Christ
[57:37] amen and from there was Paul debride you
[57:41] understand this already now the Bible
[57:43] said but if the spirit of him that raise
[57:46] up Jesus from the dead dwell in you
[57:51] so that Spirit was dwelling in Jesus
[57:57] amen then that Spirit resurrected Jesus
[58:01] from the dead
[58:02] amen so if that Spirit dwell in you
[58:09] it shall also Quicken your mortal Body
[58:14] by his spirit that dwell in you so
[58:18] before that Spirit Quicken your mortal
[58:21] body that Spirit must first dwell in you
[58:24] [Music]
[58:25] in other words your inside must first
[58:29] have the spirit that was in Jesus Christ
[58:33] so that you and Jesus on the inside you
[58:36] begin to look the same
[58:38] now the problem is your outside is still
[58:40] different
[58:41] so but if it's already sad
[58:44] it is a confirmation for the rapture
[58:50] you remember Wednesday sermon
[58:53] crushed in you is a confirmation for the
[58:56] if that spirit is already on you it
[59:00] means the Rapture is already started
[59:03] I'm gonna get to that
[59:05] we okay we okay
[59:08] job to verse 18.
[59:13] if you dare you can say Amen Paul say
[59:16] for I reckon
[59:18] that the suffering of this present time
[59:21] are not worthy to be compared with the
[59:25] glory you got my the microphone my
[59:28] friend praise God with their Glory which
[59:32] shall be revealed where in US
[59:36] so there is a glory that must be
[59:38] revealed in you
[59:43] a glory
[59:46] to be revealed
[59:50] where
[59:54] amen
[59:55] job to verse 29.
[59:59] I skip a lot but you can read this at
[1:00:02] home and if you read Romans 8 you know
[1:00:04] where we're coming from
[1:00:06] verse 29 if you dare you can say Amen
[1:00:13] no verse 23 first then 29 I'm sorry you
[1:00:18] there
[1:00:19] and not only they nature but our self
[1:00:23] also which have the water
[1:00:26] spoon stop last Sunday who was the first
[1:00:31] fruit
[1:00:33] who was the first food now Paul is
[1:00:36] saying we have the first fruit
[1:00:38] so we have who Christ in us the hope of
[1:00:43] water we okay now
[1:00:46] we okay now you remember last last
[1:00:48] Sunday Jesus Christ was the first fruit
[1:00:51] of those that slept now Paul is saying
[1:00:53] that that first fruit is in US
[1:00:56] if you notice remember last Sunday was
[1:00:58] plural
[1:01:00] and if you look right here it's again
[1:01:02] plural do you see that now Christ is now
[1:01:06] with you and
[1:01:09] Hallelujah
[1:01:10] and not only they but ourselves also
[1:01:14] which have the water
[1:01:16] so this concerned the people that have
[1:01:18] crossed in them
[1:01:25] you
[1:01:27] any side of you
[1:01:29] there is the first fruit
[1:01:32] and the first fruit that is in you is
[1:01:35] crust
[1:01:37] crust in you the confirmation of the
[1:01:40] Rapture Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:01:43] and if you already have Christ in you as
[1:01:47] the first fruit if you notice here Paul
[1:01:50] is not calling Christ Jesus Christ
[1:01:54] he's calling Christ a first fruit
[1:01:57] but the first fruit is Jesus Christ
[1:02:00] Resurrected
[1:02:02] not the man of Galilee
[1:02:05] I don't know if we okay
[1:02:07] the man of Galilee they could kill him
[1:02:11] but the Jesus that Resurrected
[1:02:15] doesn't die the man of Galilee could not
[1:02:18] go across the world
[1:02:21] but the Jesus as a fresh fruit the one
[1:02:25] that came out from the grave that one
[1:02:27] could appear and disappear that's the
[1:02:30] one that is in you because Jesus told
[1:02:33] the disciple that a little while and I'm
[1:02:36] gonna be disappearing the world won't
[1:02:38] see me but you will see me because I
[1:02:42] will be
[1:02:43] till the end of the
[1:02:46] everybody okay
[1:02:49] are we together
[1:02:52] it's a different anointing my friend
[1:02:55] you will see it
[1:02:57] everybody okay verse 23 and not only day
[1:03:01] but ourself also which have the first
[1:03:04] fruit of the water
[1:03:06] the spirit amen even we ourselves do
[1:03:09] what
[1:03:10] do we groan
[1:03:12] why are you groaning
[1:03:16] because something is sticky around you
[1:03:20] on the inside you got the first fruit
[1:03:22] but there is a part of you Eve must look
[1:03:26] the same on the inside and on the other
[1:03:29] side Paul say on the east side you are
[1:03:32] already groaning
[1:03:34] you are crying you are pulling for
[1:03:37] something
[1:03:41] Jesus say
[1:03:42] you cannot take new one
[1:03:46] your boss just drop it right now and put
[1:03:49] it in the water
[1:03:51] he will do what today by myself
[1:03:54] so you so for you to put new one you
[1:03:56] must also have water
[1:03:59] so if the new one is already on you we
[1:04:02] need to find your new vessel
[1:04:03] [Applause]
[1:04:07] we okay now we okay
[1:04:10] we okay
[1:04:15] even we ourselves grown inside ourselves
[1:04:18] waiting for the water
[1:04:21] adoption that is the Redemption of water
[1:04:27] so adoption will now bring the outside
[1:04:32] to be redeemed like the inside when you
[1:04:37] receive Christ in you something happened
[1:04:39] on the inside but the outside can still
[1:04:42] get Coronavirus the inside doesn't get
[1:04:45] coronavirus if Corona virus enter inside
[1:04:48] it kills it
[1:04:51] everybody okay everybody okay
[1:04:54] job to verse 29.
[1:04:57] I'm skipping this quickly if you dare
[1:05:00] you can say Amen
[1:05:02] so the adoption
[1:05:04] that is coming
[1:05:07] the adoption that is coming
[1:05:09] is to reach the Redemption of the body
[1:05:13] in other word not in us but now outside
[1:05:20] we okay now
[1:05:21] verse 29 for whom he did what
[1:05:26] for now he also did water
[1:05:30] predestiness so it's a it's a Bible
[1:05:32] terminology to be conformed
[1:05:36] to the image of water
[1:05:39] so you are programmed to look like Jesus
[1:05:43] Christ
[1:05:45] you are programmed to look like your
[1:05:48] Adam
[1:05:50] whatever God is doing in you the final
[1:05:54] product you must look like your husband
[1:05:58] whatever God was doing on Eve the final

[1:12:26] sanctify
[1:12:27] and cleanse it with the washing of the
[1:12:30] Water by the word that he may present it
[1:12:35] is where we're going
[1:12:38] he presented to himself so God prepared
[1:12:43] his brand to present that Brad for
[1:12:45] herself
[1:12:47] for himself
[1:12:49] amen but there is a way that he's
[1:12:52] preparing his blood he's preparing his
[1:12:55] blood according to his test
[1:13:00] he want that bread to be a certain
[1:13:02] quality

[1:14:08] in other words when they come from there
[1:14:11] no wrinkle
[1:14:17] no wrinkle
[1:14:19] Winkle is picking up the body

[1:15:22] if you start outside then it's a
[1:15:24] legalistic
[1:15:25] because the inside is still fighting
[1:15:27] back it won't work
[1:15:30] it will be a bunch of loss
[1:15:34] kill the inside that's it
[1:15:37] glory to God

[1:47:59] come back at eight years old if you die
[1:48:01] 20 years old you come back 20 years old

[1:48:10] the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:48:13] all right
[1:48:15] it's a different Resurrection

[2:31:57] started this game right
[2:31:58] it was you right oh so take it
[2:32:02] you say yes sir you're right
[2:32:07] everybody okay everybody okay when Jesus
[2:32:11] rose again he was with that sin
[2:32:15] [Applause]
[2:32:17] oh yeah
[2:32:22] what are the qualifications
[2:32:25] of the new race
[2:32:29] we okay
[2:32:31] number one qualification of the new race
[2:32:35] can I continue
[2:32:36] [Applause]
[2:32:38] cannot continue
[2:32:40] the number one qualities or attribute
[2:32:46] or attribute
[2:32:49] of this new race
[2:32:51] is this number one what is it
[2:32:57] oh Lord help me
[2:32:58] the Bible said in Romans 6 9 knowing
[2:33:02] that Christ being water raised
[2:33:05] from the dead raised from the dead
[2:33:08] daughter
[2:33:10] [Applause]
[2:33:12] because we must know how we must look
[2:33:14] like
[2:33:15] Jesus that rose again dies no more
[2:33:22] amen
[2:33:24] and death has what no more dominion over
[2:33:27] him so not only does he die death cannot
[2:33:31] do anything anymore to the Jesus that
[2:33:34] rose again
[2:33:37] in other words when death and Jesus meet
[2:33:41] again
[2:33:42] death have to take another Highway
[2:33:45] if Jesus is coming on 85 North death
[2:33:49] must take 85 South
[2:33:53] because if he meets Jesus Christ he
[2:33:56] remember what Jesus did for him
[2:34:02] has no more dominion
[2:34:05] everybody okay
[2:34:09] in Revelation 1
[2:34:11] Verse 18 the Bible said I am he that was
[2:34:14] what live
[2:34:16] and I was how dead so he resurrected and
[2:34:20] behold I am how
[2:34:21] a life how forever more
[2:34:27] so the resurrection Jesus Christ is a
[2:34:31] love forevermore
[2:34:34] is eternal
[2:34:37] he doesn't die anymore
[2:34:39] it's a new species
[2:34:41] the Lazarus died but death could come
[2:34:44] again and kill him
[2:34:46] everybody okay everybody that rose again
[2:34:50] death could come and kill them but the
[2:34:53] resurrection of Jesus Christ is separate
[2:34:56] he has to be the first one and job said
[2:34:59] let's go ahead and let's see your
[2:35:00] product when he come out
[2:35:06] death doesn't work no more
[2:35:08] they took death they say go ahead and
[2:35:10] sting him again death sting he said guys
[2:35:13] you see it's nothing come on
[2:35:17] everybody okay really father you love
[2:35:20] forever more
[2:35:23] everybody okay everybody okay
[2:35:26] everybody good
[2:35:30] let's go to Luke 24. so I can run him
[2:35:35] Maya
[2:35:38] I Was preparing this I say I'm gonna
[2:35:40] preach this quick and finish this sermon
[2:35:43] today I am in wonder
[2:35:48] amen Luke 24.
[2:35:51] if you dare you can say amen amen we
[2:35:53] want to see the qualification
[2:35:55] the attribute how does crushed that rose
[2:35:58] again look like
[2:36:00] because when he rise we must be like him
[2:36:04] we know the Rapture of the inside we are
[2:36:06] talking about the Rapture of the outside
[2:36:08] but before we talk about how the Rapture
[2:36:11] happened we need to know how are we
[2:36:13] going to do what is the final product
[2:36:14] you say the first fruit fresh fruit
[2:36:17] means what
[2:36:18] first fruit number one means it doesn't
[2:36:20] die
[2:36:21] it is eternal
[2:36:23] Eternal forevermore Faith fruit means
[2:36:25] when you coming when deaf see you God
[2:36:28] goes into a different place
[2:36:31] you become a threat for death
[2:36:33] everybody okay Luke 24 verse 29 if you
[2:36:37] dare you can say Amen we're talking
[2:36:39] about the Jesus that rose again
[2:36:42] amen Jesus was going talking to the
[2:36:46] disciple on the road to Emmaus
[2:36:49] amen
[2:36:50] and verse 29 but they constrained him
[2:36:54] saying a bird with us for it is
[2:36:57] throughout the evening and the day is
[2:36:59] first spent and he went in to Terry with
[2:37:03] them
[2:37:04] came to pass as he started meet with
[2:37:07] them he took bread and blessed and broke
[2:37:11] and gave to them
[2:37:13] and their eyes were watered open and
[2:37:16] they knew him and he did water vanished
[2:37:19] out of their sight so the resurrection
[2:37:22] Jesus Christ can appear
[2:37:26] and talk to you
[2:37:28] and walk with you but he can also
[2:37:31] disappear
[2:37:33] [Music]
[2:37:34] it's a new species
[2:37:37] it's a species that can appear
[2:37:41] live a normal life
[2:37:45] and can also disappear
[2:37:50] it is not a ghost
[2:37:55] job to verse 36.
[2:37:58] amen
[2:38:00] amen
[2:38:02] are you there verse 36 and as the death
[2:38:06] spoke Jesus himself stood well
[2:38:12] the door were closed
[2:38:16] the disciples were talking
[2:38:19] so when they sit they were talking they
[2:38:21] begin to talk about him
[2:38:23] when they begin to talk about him
[2:38:25] suddenly Jesus is there in the midst of
[2:38:29] him
[2:38:31] they say oh we know this quality
[2:38:35] that's a ghost
[2:38:37] because that goes to who appear and
[2:38:39] disappear he says and thus Jesus stood
[2:38:43] himself in the midst of him and said to
[2:38:45] them be peace be to you but they were
[2:38:48] terrified and frightened
[2:38:57] and suppose that they have seen the
[2:38:59] water the spirit or a ghost
[2:39:02] and he said to them why are you trouble
[2:39:05] and why do thoughts arise in your heart
[2:39:08] behold my water and by water that is I
[2:39:12] myself handle me and see for a spirit
[2:39:16] has not what flesh and water as you see
[2:39:20] me water have Jesus resurrected his
[2:39:24] flesh and Bone
[2:39:26] how can flesh unborn appear and
[2:39:30] disappear
[2:39:33] Jesus resurrected his flesh and born in
[2:39:37] other words he had the human body
[2:39:43] he has a human body amen he said hey you
[2:39:47] thinking that I'm a ghost
[2:39:48] so if you're thinking Amigos come and
[2:39:51] touch me because according to the ghost
[2:39:54] if you put your hand like this your hand
[2:39:56] will go and pass and come this way
[2:39:59] because it's a ghost Jesus say go ahead
[2:40:01] and touch me so when you touch you get a
[2:40:04] blockage so this is not a ghost this is
[2:40:06] human being
[2:40:07] but they look they say wait a minute
[2:40:09] human being we understand
[2:40:12] but disappearing and appearing what kind
[2:40:16] of human being is this
[2:40:18] it is a new race
[2:40:20] it is a new species
[2:40:22] everybody okay verse 40 and when he has
[2:40:25] that spoken he showed them his hand and
[2:40:27] his feet and while they yet believe not
[2:40:30] for joy and wonder he said to them have
[2:40:34] you have any meat in other words yeah
[2:40:40] yeah it's a human being
[2:40:42] ah he say wait a minute
[2:40:45] give me a hamburger
[2:40:49] everybody okay
[2:40:50] everybody okay and they gave him a piece
[2:40:53] of brawl fish and of a honeycomb and he
[2:40:57] took it and did it before so Jesus
[2:41:01] resurrected was able to eat
[2:41:05] and he can drink
[2:41:07] and yet he can disappear
[2:41:10] and when he disappeared he disappeared
[2:41:13] with the drink that you gave him
[2:41:16] and the food that you gave him it
[2:41:18] doesn't mean when he disappeared you see
[2:41:21] the food on the ground
[2:41:25] everybody
[2:41:27] okay so as your natural food is entering
[2:41:32] his body there is something in that body
[2:41:35] that is transforming everything to a
[2:41:39] different material
[2:41:42] [Applause]
[2:41:46] [Music]
[2:41:49] if you fool you let me know
[2:41:51] let's go to the Book of John
[2:41:56] John chapter 20. I'm gonna hurry oh God
[2:42:00] help me John chapter 20 verse 19. if you
[2:42:04] dare you can say Amen we want to know
[2:42:06] how does this Jesus look like
[2:42:16] John chapter 20 verse 19 you there
[2:42:19] then the same day at evening being the
[2:42:22] first day of the week when the water
[2:42:25] doors let's go my brother I need some
[2:42:28] Force
[2:42:29] one day those who are water sure
[2:42:32] where the disciple were assembly for
[2:42:34] what fear of the Jews came Jesus and
[2:42:38] water in the water the resurrected Jesus
[2:42:42] Christ doesn't need the doors
[2:42:48] I told you in Luke but I gave you John
[2:42:50] so you can see that the disciple door
[2:42:52] will close in other words he doesn't
[2:42:55] need a door to be open he can just enter
[2:42:57] in your house and he's moving up he say
[2:43:00] how are you doing and the alarm doesn't
[2:43:02] even sound
[2:43:04] your ADT doesn't work
[2:43:07] your CPI doesn't work
[2:43:10] because his material is different
[2:43:19] [Applause]
[2:43:20] everybody okay
[2:43:22] everybody okay
[2:43:24] everybody okay
[2:43:27] job to verse 25.
[2:43:29] oh my God verse 25
[2:43:32] they are the disciple therefore said to
[2:43:34] him to Thomas except that see in my hand
[2:43:40] in my hand in his hand the print of the
[2:43:44] nail and put my finger into the print of
[2:43:47] the nail and trust my hand in the sad I
[2:43:50] will not water
[2:43:51] so God knew there is a disciple that
[2:43:53] will struggle
[2:43:55] for the print and for the nail
[2:43:58] so God who knew everything say
[2:44:01] if I'm take Jesus Christ and I make
[2:44:05] disappear everything from him and make
[2:44:08] it to New these folks the way I know
[2:44:11] them they will have a hard time
[2:44:12] believing that is Jesus
[2:44:16] they will have a hard time believing
[2:44:18] that he was the one that crucified I
[2:44:20] need to leave a mark that will be
[2:44:23] speaking about the crucifixion
[2:44:25] so when they see the mark it will it's a
[2:44:29] it's an additional stabilizing School
[2:44:32] to stabilize somebody that look at the
[2:44:35] Mark now you understand that it's me
[2:44:37] because you need some extra screw to
[2:44:39] stabilize you you need some more
[2:44:41] scripture
[2:44:42] to help you up
[2:44:47] everybody okay everything look good on
[2:44:51] Jesus Christ except the print
[2:44:55] because the Jews need them
[2:44:57] according to the prophecy everybody okay
[2:45:00] and after eight days again his disciple
[2:45:04] went how inside I need more volume and
[2:45:07] Thomas with them then came home Jesus
[2:45:10] the dog being house
[2:45:13] and stood how in the midst and said
[2:45:16] Peace be to you the resurrected Christ

[3:14:22] wonder how you're going to buy a book
[3:14:24] you have to go to your father and you
[3:14:26] say Daddy the teachers say we need to
[3:14:28] buy this book and when you say to Daddy
[3:14:31] that's all you need
[3:14:32] it is his responsibility to fund Amazon
[3:14:35] to fund the money to pay and to bring
[3:14:38] the book To You remind your father his
[3:14:41] responsibility
[3:14:42] [Music]

[3:14:46] not for you to be paying bills he need

[3:15:01] father thanking you for your grace
[3:15:04] for your love and for your mercy and for
[3:15:06] the things that you unfolding to our
[3:15:08] life
[3:15:10] the things
[3:15:12] because your people perish for lack of
[3:15:15] knowledge that the scripture says
[3:15:18] an ignorance
[3:15:20] is something that the devil has been
[3:15:22] using

[3:15:25] to enslave
[3:15:29] to make us live
[3:15:31] below our privileges
[3:15:34] because we don't know how to operate
[3:15:37] your laws
[3:15:38] but father the time has come
[3:15:41] that you don't want us to live again in
[3:15:43] darkness
