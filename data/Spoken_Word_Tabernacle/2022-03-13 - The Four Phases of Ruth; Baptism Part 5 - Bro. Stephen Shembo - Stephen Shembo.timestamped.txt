[12:10] y'all could be seated just for a second
[12:13] i don't have any uh praise requests or
[12:15] praise reports or or prayer requests
[12:17] this morning
[12:19] um
[12:20] so
[12:22] let me get let me give you this little
[12:24] testimony i i saw something yesterday i
[12:27] guess he was a college he was a college
[12:28] man like a phd or something but
[12:31] he was explaining about uh the hebrew
[12:34] language and he said that they used just
[12:37] consonants
[12:38] and you should know that they said if
[12:40] you know the hebrew language you know it
[12:42] well enough to interject the correct
[12:45] vowel in the word
[12:47] so he was speaking of the word yahweh
[12:50] and how you know the bible just got it
[12:52] as four letters
[12:53] but he did call it the
[12:55] the great creator's name
[12:58] so he said
[12:59] that it's one of the only words
[13:03] in language that you don't you really
[13:05] don't use your tongue with
[13:08] so i started and then he he went on to
[13:10] explain
[13:12] he said
[13:13] the word yahweh expresses
[13:16] breath
[13:18] i hope this microphone will do it
[13:20] because he's spoken to his
[13:22] and he said when you breathe in and then
[13:25] you breathe out
[13:26] okay it says the word yahweh
[13:29] the great creator let's see if i don't
[13:31] know that it'll do it i haven't tried it
[13:33] this morning but you can do it you know
[13:35] and you can think about it
[13:36] so let's see
[13:43] so he said the first word that you said
[13:46] when you were born
[13:49] was the name of the great creator
[13:52] he said the last word that you'll say on
[13:54] the way out
[13:58] is the name of yahweh
[14:02] man
[14:03] he said he was sitting in a room of phds
[14:06] and he said you could hear the tears
[14:08] falling
[14:10] with these with these other people
[14:13] he said now
[14:15] here's what here's what struck me
[14:18] there's no catholic way to breathe
[14:22] there's no hindu way to breathe
[14:26] there's no muslim way to breathe
[14:30] so everyone
[14:33] says yahweh they acknowledge
[14:36] our god
[14:38] yahweh
[14:39] when they take a breath isn't that
[14:41] awesome
[14:42] amen does anybody have a praise report
[14:45] that they would like to share this
[14:46] morning yes ma'am

[56:03] in the sanctified state
[56:07] wise and foolish
[56:10] they that were foolish

[57:11] some of you are still struggling with
[57:12] gas i don't know
[57:14] okay but the wives took oil
[57:17] in their vessels with their water
[57:20] so the foolish have oil
[57:23] but not the second oil there is two oil
[57:28] am i reading a different bubble
[57:31] there is a first oil
[57:33] and there is a second oil
[57:38] amen the first soul will make you go
[57:42] until
[57:45] a certain spot
[57:47] and you can even slumber
[57:51] and sleep
[57:58] oh god
[58:00] five why the bridegroom terry he delayed
[58:04] they all slumbered and did water with
[58:08] the old
[58:10] everybody okay
[58:11] verse six and at the midnight amen
[58:16] there was a cry stay on the surface
[58:20] made behold the bridegroom cometh
[58:24] go you out to do water
[58:27] everybody virgin everybody have a lamp
[58:30] everybody have oil
[58:32] the only difference there was another
[58:34] set of oil that could not be revealed
[58:38] only after the midnight cry
[58:48] there was a first container
[58:52] the first container i'm just
[58:55] there
[58:56] there is like a flame there there is a
[58:59] container there is a lamp right there
[59:02] and there is a flame right there
[59:04] amen in this lamp we got oil
[59:08] that's your first soil you keep it
[59:10] sanctified jesus is coming jesus is
[59:12] coming jesus is coming amen but there
[59:15] was another oil that was in a different
[59:18] container
[59:21] amen
[59:23] only the foolish kept it at all
[59:26] and they didn't use that oil
[59:28] until in other words could not be
[59:31] unloaded
[59:33] until the midnight cry
[59:36] is it okay
[59:37] amen
[59:38] it takes the midnight cry to activate
[59:42] this oil
[59:46] amen
[59:48] hallelujah
[59:50] my god
[59:51] then all verse seven all the virgins
[59:54] arose
[59:55] and trim their lamp
[59:57] they start cleaning their lives
[1:00:00] amen
[1:00:02] and the foolish say to the wise
[1:00:05] givers of your oil
[1:00:08] they were not looking at this oil here
[1:00:10] they already have it
[1:00:12] amen they found out that when the
[1:00:14] midnight cry came
[1:00:15] what they had
[1:00:17] was no longer enough
[1:00:20] to meet the bridegroom
[1:00:22] they needed the second set of oil to be
[1:00:24] opened
[1:00:29] that oil only opened after the midnight
[1:00:32] cry
[1:00:36] the first oil
[1:00:38] could prepare you
[1:00:40] to wait for the bridegroom but you can
[1:00:42] slumber
[1:00:44] remember peter have faith
[1:00:48] you remember
[1:00:49] you remember peter have faith but his
[1:00:51] faith could fail
[1:00:53] and jesus saw them he said when you are
[1:00:56] converted
[1:00:57] when you get the second one over there
[1:00:59] no more game
[1:01:02] you're going to meet the bridegroom
[1:01:05] hallelujah
[1:01:08] brother kelly got it verse eight and the
[1:01:10] foolish say to the wise givers of your
[1:01:13] oil
[1:01:14] for our lamp are gone out
[1:01:17] how can you have an oil and that lamb
[1:01:19] begin to go out
[1:01:21] you need a second set of oil this second
[1:01:24] set of oil will make you meet the blood
[1:01:27] group
[1:01:28] that's a different
[1:01:30] yet it's oil
[1:01:32] but it's just on a different container
[1:01:34] amen
[1:01:35] verse nine
[1:01:37] but the wise answered saying not so
[1:01:41] lest there be not enough for us
[1:01:44] and you
[1:01:45] so that oil
[1:01:47] is customized for one person
[1:01:52] it's a quantity
[1:01:54] that belongs to one person
[1:01:56] you will see even the measurement of
[1:01:58] roof down the road
[1:02:00] amen
[1:02:02] hallelujah
[1:02:03] but go you rather to them that cell you
[1:02:07] need to go back again
[1:02:09] go search for it because the midnight
[1:02:11] cry is saying that the husband is here
[1:02:13] we got to move on
[1:02:15] now it's your time to go back again and
[1:02:16] to start all over again
[1:02:18] amen to them they sell and buy for
[1:02:22] yourself
[1:02:23] and while they want to buy they realize
[1:02:26] they're in trouble
[1:02:29] when they go to fix their lives
[1:02:34] amen
[1:02:35] while they went to buy the bridegroom
[1:02:39] came
[1:02:41] back here
[1:02:42] the one who saw the bridegroom was the
[1:02:45] one that had the oil on the sec in the
[1:02:48] second container
[1:02:51] not the first one all of them missed it
[1:02:54] while the bridegroom came and they they
[1:02:56] were ready
[1:02:58] so to be ready was what
[1:03:04] this is now ready

[1:08:03] commit suicide
[1:08:05] that's not it
[1:08:07] that's not what he's saying he cannot be
[1:08:11] my disciple
[1:08:18] salvation free
[1:08:21] but there is a higher price
[1:08:33] to pay
[1:08:36] should we hate our families that's not
[1:08:38] what i'm saying
[1:08:39] let's continue verse 27
[1:08:42] and whosoever does not bear his cross
[1:08:47] so he goes not only with a price
[1:08:50] it's going with a cross
[1:08:53] amen
[1:08:55] and
[1:08:57] does not bear his cross and come after
[1:09:00] me cannot be my disciple
[1:09:04] you all are following me
[1:09:06] let me tighten you up pretty good and
[1:09:08] tell you that when you follow me
[1:09:11] this is what you got to do and this is
[1:09:13] what you got to do verse 28
[1:09:16] for which of you intending to build a
[1:09:19] tower
[1:09:20] sit not down first
[1:09:23] and count the water
[1:09:26] so jesus is showing you there is a cost
[1:09:31] amen
[1:09:32] whether he have sufficients
[1:09:35] to finish it
[1:09:36] lest happily
[1:09:38] after he had laid the water
[1:09:42] what is foundation
[1:09:44] by the robert can you say it loud what
[1:09:47] is foundation
[1:09:52] i don't want you to follow me
[1:09:56] if you have not examined what you're
[1:09:58] getting into it
[1:10:02] does it make sense
[1:10:03] lest you start
[1:10:05] like judah
[1:10:09] and don't finish the house
[1:10:13] that you
[1:10:14] started
[1:10:16] make sure you evaluate
[1:10:20] but stephen the gospel is good it's free
[1:10:23] yes
[1:10:24] it's more than you think
[1:10:28] amen
[1:10:29] less happily after he had laid the
[1:10:32] foundation
[1:10:33] and he's not able to finish it
[1:10:36] so laying the foundation is not too much
[1:10:40] the end the problem is to finish what
[1:10:44] you started
[1:10:46] amen
[1:10:48] the end
[1:10:49] amen and finish it
[1:10:52] all that behold
[1:10:54] it begin to do water
[1:10:57] look at them when they started brother
[1:10:59] brandon i'm safe what random say long
[1:11:01] they look at them now they start wearing
[1:11:03] pants
[1:11:06] oh they start putting makeup like ass
[1:11:09] you see now they start putting hearing
[1:11:11] now they say them their own message have
[1:11:14] trouble
[1:11:16] you started
[1:11:18] you didn't know where you finishing
[1:11:20] now the people will mock you
[1:11:27] you think you being cool the
[1:11:29] denomination will mock you
[1:11:31] when you try to imitate them
[1:11:34] when you're wearing dresses like them
[1:11:36] when you come with tight dresses
[1:11:39] they look they say you see they were
[1:11:40] like lose lose look at her now
[1:11:44] and when they see you they say yes this
[1:11:46] is the way you need to dress and they
[1:11:47] turn around and say
[1:11:50] branamite
[1:11:56] you didn't know what you were getting
[1:11:57] into
[1:11:59] saying verse 30 this man began to build
[1:12:03] and was not able to finish it or what
[1:12:06] king
[1:12:07] going to make war
[1:12:09] against another king sit not down first
[1:12:13] and consult whether he be able with ten
[1:12:16] thousand to meet him that comes against
[1:12:19] him with twenty thousand let's stay on
[1:12:21] the surface
[1:12:23] or else while the other is yet a great
[1:12:27] way off
[1:12:28] he sends an ambassador
[1:12:30] and desire conditions of peace or an
[1:12:34] ambassador amen
[1:12:36] verse 33 so likewise there is two
[1:12:39] parables there
[1:12:40] whosoever
[1:12:43] whosoever he be of you that forsake not
[1:12:47] what
[1:12:49] that he has
[1:12:51] amen
[1:12:52] he cannot be my disciple
[1:12:56] forsaking your father forsaking your
[1:12:58] mother forsaking your wife forsaking
[1:13:00] your husband forsaking your children and
[1:13:02] forsaking yourself
[1:13:04] but the proper language here they say
[1:13:06] hate
[1:13:10] let me quieten your nerve a little bit
[1:13:12] down
[1:13:13] matthew 10.
[1:13:14] the bible says
[1:13:16] you okay now he the lovely father
[1:13:22] or mother
[1:13:23] more than me
[1:13:26] that's what they hate me
[1:13:28] not for you to go hate your father
[1:13:32] everybody here
[1:13:33] but do not put daddy before god
[1:13:39] do not put your wife before god
[1:13:42] god say do this
[1:13:44] mama your wife is in the back giving
[1:13:47] command
[1:13:48] and you can't stand upon the word of god
[1:13:51] you're just obeying the command of your
[1:13:53] wife
[1:13:54] you're in trouble
[1:13:58] everybody here god said go to church
[1:14:01] your husband say stay home
[1:14:04] if that husband is before god
[1:14:07] you're gonna find yourself in hell
[1:14:11] he the lover father i'm just helping you
[1:14:14] now so take the heads
[1:14:16] a different way that love a father or
[1:14:19] mother more than me
[1:14:21] he's not worthy of me
[1:14:24] he the love of son or daughter more than
[1:14:27] me now it makes sense
[1:14:29] he's not worthy of me and he that take
[1:14:32] care not his what
[1:14:34] you understand the scripture now
[1:14:37] and follow after me is not worthy of me
[1:14:41] and he defunded for his life that word
[1:14:44] means save
[1:14:47] shall lose it
[1:14:48] and he that loses his life shall fund it
[1:14:53] for my sexual
[1:14:55] it
[1:14:56] so there is a price
[1:14:58] for you to love everything
[1:15:02] even yourself
[1:15:04] more
[1:15:05] less than god
[1:15:07] you gotta forsake everything there is a
[1:15:10] price
[1:15:11] there is a cross
[1:15:13] yet
[1:15:13] it's free
[1:15:16] let's pray
[1:15:18] heavenly father lord we are approaching
[1:15:20] you again humbly father this morning
[1:15:23] thanking you for your grace your love
[1:15:25] your mercy and for everything you have
[1:15:27] been doing for us
[1:15:29] father starting a week and finishing it
[1:15:31] it's not a habit
[1:15:33] it is lord a grace because many people
[1:15:36] started this week with us and were not
[1:15:39] even able to finish it lord but by your
[1:15:42] grace and your mercy you have preserved
[1:15:44] us in the midst of pandemic in the midst
[1:15:47] of everything that is going careless
[1:15:49] father you even given us the desire to
[1:15:52] come into your house father when the
[1:15:54] weather is so bad when it's very cold
[1:15:56] outside but lord father you gave us the
[1:15:59] strength and the ability to come into
[1:16:01] your presence lord if there is anything
[1:16:04] that we have done that grief the holy
[1:16:06] spirit may you forgive us father may
[1:16:08] nothing hinder the work of your spirit
[1:16:11] this morning we commit ourselves unto
[1:16:13] the hand be the alpha and the omega the
[1:16:15] beginning and the ending of this service
[1:16:18] as we're expecting and looking unto thee
[1:16:20] the author and the finisher of our faith
[1:16:23] we humbly ask it in the name of jesus
[1:16:25] christ
[1:16:26] amen
[1:16:27] god richly bless you
[1:16:31] we are tonight today on the fourth phase
[1:16:34] of roof
[1:16:35] we're talking about the baptism
[1:16:38] if i can get there
[1:16:41] on the four phases of roof
[1:16:43] we found out that roof departed from
[1:16:46] moab everybody okay
[1:16:48] when he departed from moab he was going
[1:16:51] into the land of judah
[1:16:54] and going into the land of judah we
[1:16:56] found out that roof
[1:16:57] met
[1:16:58] a certain point on his life which was a
[1:17:01] very critical point because at that
[1:17:04] point roof have to take a decision
[1:17:07] everybody okay
[1:17:09] and we took the point of that place
[1:17:12] which is the road going to judah and we
[1:17:15] found out that when we took that place
[1:17:18] and we converted that place
[1:17:21] into the tabernacle language
[1:17:24] everybody okay
[1:17:26] that place in the tabernacle language
[1:17:29] was called the other court
[1:17:33] everybody okay
[1:17:36] the bible have conversions
[1:17:40] everybody okay
[1:17:41] the bible have a language
[1:17:44] the bible is written in numbers
[1:17:48] it's written in science it's written in
[1:17:51] many different things and all those
[1:17:53] sounds all the numbers all the furniture
[1:17:57] everything that is going on in the bible
[1:17:59] have a message behind it
[1:18:01] everybody okay
[1:18:04] i can tell you grace
[1:18:07] that's a language
[1:18:09] you can open it in the bible it's there
[1:18:11] it's grace but when i take grace
[1:18:14] and i convert grace into a numerical
[1:18:18] language
[1:18:19] of the bible
[1:18:21] that grace becomes firm
[1:18:24] everybody here so when i say five
[1:18:27] and i say creation i'm saying the same
[1:18:30] thing
[1:18:31] it's only a different language
[1:18:33] everybody correct
[1:18:35] just like you convert the celsius degree
[1:18:39] into
[1:18:40] fahrenheit degree everybody here the
[1:18:44] temperature outside does not change
[1:18:48] if it's called in celsius
[1:18:51] it is also called in fahrenheit
[1:18:55] ever here but the language is only
[1:18:58] different
[1:19:00] everybody here so far
[1:19:02] so there is a conversion or a language
[1:19:05] in the
[1:19:06] bible
[1:19:08] there is a mathematics
[1:19:11] that goes in the bible
[1:19:13] everybody here if you don't learn that
[1:19:15] mathematic you're going to get in
[1:19:17] trouble
[1:19:18] everybody and only a prophet can afford
[1:19:22] that mathematics
[1:19:28] how many heard about quadratic equation
[1:19:32] how many heard about it
[1:19:35] have you heard about something that is
[1:19:36] called delta
[1:19:39] have you heard about it
[1:19:41] when delta is positive
[1:19:43] there is two answers
[1:19:45] there is like x1
[1:19:47] and x2 have you read about it when delta
[1:19:50] is equal to 0
[1:19:52] x1 equal to x2
[1:19:55] do you remember that
[1:19:57] and then when delta is negative
[1:20:00] there is no solution
[1:20:02] do you remember that
[1:20:10] do you remember that
[1:20:11] this thing also goes in the scripture
[1:20:17] everybody here
[1:20:18] they are scripture that have a compound
[1:20:20] meaning
[1:20:22] [Applause]
[1:20:26] when i say justification
[1:20:28] sanctification
[1:20:30] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:20:32] here i can say it like luther
[1:20:36] wesley and pentecost
[1:20:39] i can say it like roof deciding
[1:20:42] roof surfing and roof
[1:20:45] resting
[1:20:47] everybody here
[1:20:49] and sometimes that language might be
[1:20:51] saying the same thing
[1:20:54] ever here
[1:20:57] it is the mathematic of the scripture
[1:21:00] and sometimes you can plug in something
[1:21:03] and there is no solution
[1:21:08] they ask jesus christ one time when are
[1:21:10] you coming
[1:21:13] and jesus said i don't know
[1:21:16] nobody knows only the father because
[1:21:19] there is no human solution it is locked
[1:21:22] by the father delta is negative
[1:21:29] are we okay
[1:21:30] so when we're talking about roof at the
[1:21:33] place of decision
[1:21:37] before you distract somebody
[1:21:41] when we talk about roof in the place of
[1:21:44] decision when you convert the place of
[1:21:47] decision
[1:21:49] it means roof in the other court
[1:21:54] everybody cares so far
[1:21:55] and we found out in the other court we
[1:21:58] have the brazen altar
[1:22:00] and we have also the lever everybody
[1:22:03] okay
[1:22:04] we explained to you in detail the brazen
[1:22:06] altar amen
[1:22:08] then we found out later on that israel
[1:22:12] was in trouble
[1:22:13] israel was taken away from god into
[1:22:16] idolatry by jezebel everybody okay
[1:22:20] when israel was completely on the
[1:22:22] idolatry
[1:22:24] the faith of israel was completely gone
[1:22:28] then god sent a prophet
[1:22:31] by the name of elijah everybody
[1:22:35] and the reason why elijah came elijah
[1:22:37] came to restore
[1:22:39] the faith of israel that was completely
[1:22:42] lost
[1:22:43] and we found out that when elijah came
[1:22:47] instead of elijah bringing israel to
[1:22:50] talk to them
[1:22:51] elijah begin to repair the altar
[1:22:57] when elijah repaired the altar
[1:23:00] elijah also took water and put there
[1:23:04] anybody
[1:23:05] when you take these
[1:23:07] symbols here and you convert that symbol
[1:23:12] into the tabernacle
[1:23:14] elijah was bringing the other court
[1:23:18] to israel
[1:23:20] the door
[1:23:21] because water is the gate
[1:23:25] here
[1:23:26] ever here so when somebody is completely
[1:23:28] away from god you must know what to
[1:23:31] bring to that person
[1:23:33] not the seventh seal
[1:23:35] not the feast of the trumpet you must
[1:23:38] bring unto him the other court first
[1:23:43] everybody okay
[1:23:45] because the altar was speaking about the
[1:23:47] brazen altar and then the lever the
[1:23:50] water was speaking about the level
[1:23:52] everybody care and later on elijah prey
[1:23:55] and the fire came on
[1:23:57] anybody care
[1:23:59] then we have repent
[1:24:01] when you converted toward the book of
[1:24:03] acts
[1:24:05] be baptized in the name of jesus christ
[1:24:08] and back here and you shall receive the
[1:24:10] water
[1:24:12] when you converted in the book of acts
[1:24:14] he goes to act 238
[1:24:16] so you're moving from elijah to the
[1:24:19] tabernacle from the tabernacle to the
[1:24:21] book of art the conversion of the bible
[1:24:24] is perfect
[1:24:25] and you need a prophet
[1:24:27] everybody okay so far
[1:24:29] now if you look right here we have
[1:24:31] repentance
[1:24:34] everybody okay
[1:24:36] then we have the baptism
[1:24:40] repentance at the present altar
[1:24:42] everybody okay and the baptism at the
[1:24:45] level
[1:24:46] and we found out that the third element
[1:24:48] was fire
[1:24:49] everybody care when we went into the tub
[1:24:52] and i called the tabernacle have three
[1:24:54] parts everybody okay
[1:24:56] we found out that the brazen altar and
[1:24:59] the level was speaking about the other
[1:25:01] court right here that's your one embark
[1:25:03] here
[1:25:04] ever here your two also was right here
[1:25:07] repent and be baptized everybody okay
[1:25:10] then your tree goes into the holy place
[1:25:13] but there is a space here that is
[1:25:16] missing
[1:25:17] everybody okay
[1:25:19] elijah rebuilt the altar
[1:25:22] in reference to the present altar elijah
[1:25:25] put water in reference to the level
[1:25:28] the fire of god not a human fire
[1:25:32] a divine fire that consumed everything
[1:25:36] came from god in reference to the pillar
[1:25:39] of fire in the holiest
[1:25:41] but where is the other court right here
[1:25:45] although the holy place right here we
[1:25:47] still see that there is a place that is
[1:25:50] missing here the holy place
[1:25:52] i want you to keep this pretty good
[1:25:54] because down the road you need it ever
[1:25:56] here
[1:25:57] if you go to the book of uh first king
[1:26:00] you'll find out that before the fire
[1:26:03] fell
[1:26:05] elijah prayed
[1:26:10] and in the prayer of elijah it's only
[1:26:13] two verses
[1:26:15] elijah said that
[1:26:17] and it came to pass
[1:26:19] at the time of the offering of the
[1:26:21] evening sacrifice you know what it means
[1:26:24] that elijah the prophet came near near
[1:26:27] what
[1:26:29] he came near the altar
[1:26:32] the altar that was combined with the
[1:26:34] level
[1:26:35] elijah approaches the altar everybody
[1:26:38] okay
[1:26:39] and what is the larger deed that at this
[1:26:41] altar because remember the publican
[1:26:46] you remember
[1:26:48] and the pharisee
[1:26:49] both of them went for prayer in the
[1:26:52] temple
[1:26:53] and we found out that they were in the
[1:26:55] other court
[1:26:58] everybody okay
[1:26:59] now when elijah came near to the altar
[1:27:02] he said
[1:27:04] lord god of e of abraham
[1:27:06] of isaac and of who
[1:27:08] he didn't say jacob
[1:27:12] let it be known this day
[1:27:14] that the art god in israel and that i am
[1:27:19] the servant
[1:27:20] everybody okay
[1:27:22] and that i have done all these things at
[1:27:25] that water
[1:27:26] so everything elijah was doing was
[1:27:30] according to the word of god
[1:27:37] everybody here the foundation of god
[1:27:41] must be based according to the word of
[1:27:43] god
[1:27:46] everybody okay so far he did it not with
[1:27:49] his intellect
[1:27:51] he did it not with what somebody else
[1:27:53] said but he did it according to the
[1:27:56] vision
[1:27:57] that god gave to him and that vision
[1:28:00] matches perfectly the tabernacle
[1:28:05] everybody okay so far
[1:28:07] and when he did it according to the word
[1:28:10] if you will notice here when elijah
[1:28:13] approaches the altar elijah begin to
[1:28:16] pray
[1:28:20] anybody here
[1:28:22] he say hear me o lord
[1:28:24] hear me that these people may know that
[1:28:28] they are to the lord god and that are
[1:28:31] and that has turned their heart back
[1:28:34] again so between
[1:28:38] everybody
[1:28:39] between
[1:28:41] the brazen altar and the level and
[1:28:45] they're coming down of fire
[1:28:48] ever here
[1:28:50] there was a space of time
[1:28:54] of prayer
[1:28:59] and that prayer
[1:29:00] before the altar
[1:29:02] let's go to the book of second
[1:29:05] chronicles
[1:29:08] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:29:11] lord
[1:29:13] second chronicle chapter six
[1:29:15] i was looking for this scripture i just

[1:29:35] day of the dedication and solomon is
[1:29:38] coming in the temple what is solomon
[1:29:41] doing in the temple if you're there you

[1:29:53] the lord therefore solomon came and
[1:29:55] begin to speak
[1:29:57] he said the lord therefore
[1:29:59] has performed his word that he has
[1:30:02] spoken
[1:30:03] for i am reason up in the room of david
[1:30:06] my father
[1:30:07] and i am set on the throne of israel as
[1:30:10] the lord promised ever here
[1:30:13] and have built the house
[1:30:16] for the name of the lord of israel
[1:30:19] everybody here
[1:30:21] and in it in the house the temple
[1:30:25] heaven put the ark yes
[1:30:28] wherein is the covenant of the lord
[1:30:31] that he made with the children of israel
[1:30:34] watch carefully now you there

[1:30:41] so the prayer of solomon

[1:30:48] the present altar
[1:30:50] remember when they were burning the
[1:30:52] sacrifice it was also prayer going on
[1:30:55] so solomon rose went straight ahead and
[1:30:59] approaches the president and begin to
[1:31:02] pray
[1:31:03] and elijah also at the time of the
[1:31:06] evening sacrifice
[1:31:08] approaches the present altar
[1:31:11] and begin to pray
[1:31:16] everybody okay
[1:31:18] verse 12 and he stood before the altar
[1:31:21] of the lord in the presence of all the

[1:32:20] praying at the present altar
[1:32:23] hey

[1:32:29] so solomon was doing everything that was
[1:32:32] in the tabernacle and reproduce it there
[1:32:35] so solomon right here is at the other
[1:32:37] coat yes before the president alter
[1:32:40] everybody okay

[1:34:56] x1 equals x2
[1:35:00] delta is equal to zero
[1:35:04] everybody okay
[1:35:05] the mathematic of the bible you there
[1:35:07] the fire came down from where
[1:35:10] the fire of elijah came from where
[1:35:14] the fire came down from heaven and
[1:35:17] consumed the water
[1:35:20] when the fire of elijah came down he
[1:35:22] consumed also what
[1:35:25] lord i have done all of this according
[1:35:27] to your
[1:35:29] everybody here
[1:35:30] and confirm and consume the burn
[1:35:33] offering and the sacrifice and the water
[1:35:38] deed water
[1:35:40] so they're coming down of the fire was
[1:35:43] bringing the glory of god
[1:35:46] remember in the day of pentecost it was
[1:35:48] the holy ghost and fire the fire and the
[1:35:51] glory are coming together everybody okay
[1:35:54] verse two and the priest could not enter
[1:35:57] into the house of the lord because the
[1:35:59] glory of the lord had filled the lord's
[1:36:01] house
[1:36:03] and when all the children of israel saw
[1:36:06] how the fire came down and the glory of
[1:36:09] the lord upon the house they did water
[1:36:12] do you remember in elijah
[1:36:15] they cried they bowed themself with
[1:36:18] their face to the ground upon the
[1:36:19] pavement and worshiped and praised the
[1:36:22] lord saying for he is
[1:36:24] for his mercy endure for what so we can
[1:36:27] find out that even with solomon he
[1:36:30] approaches the present altar and when he
[1:36:33] begin to pray something happened elijah
[1:36:36] had a space of time for prayer
[1:36:42] what is wrong with prayer
[1:36:44] everybody okay
[1:36:45] we find repentance
[1:36:47] baptism it's the other court
[1:36:50] we found the fire is the holiest
[1:36:53] but we found between the outer coat and
[1:36:55] the hole yes there is a space of time
[1:36:57] for what prayer
[1:37:01] everybody okay
[1:37:03] but when you go into the tabernacle
[1:37:06] inside the holy place we have true
[1:37:09] furniture
[1:37:13] towards the south we have the
[1:37:15] candlestick
[1:37:18] and then you have the table of the
[1:37:20] showbread
[1:37:21] but in before the veil here
[1:37:25] there was something
[1:37:26] another altar
[1:37:28] that was called the altar of water
[1:37:31] which was representing water
[1:37:37] [Music]
[1:37:39] everybody here so prayer activate the
[1:37:43] holy place
[1:37:47] are you following me
[1:37:49] this is a tabernacle language
[1:37:52] [Music]
[1:37:53] are you with me
[1:37:55] let's go to luke chapter one
[1:37:59] relax
[1:38:00] because i can't go
[1:38:02] 75 miles in this one
[1:38:04] let's go to luke chapter one
[1:38:07] oh my god at the opening of the seventh
[1:38:10] seal
[1:38:12] the bible became a new
[1:38:16] so now you understand the seventh seal
[1:38:17] is not a book
[1:38:21] that anybody can read even the people
[1:38:23] that hate brother branham
[1:38:26] the seventh seal is something else
[1:38:29] if you catch the seventh hill then you
[1:38:31] will see the bible is always opening
[1:38:33] like this
[1:38:35] yes
[1:38:36] the shields the shields they see you
[1:38:38] better know what the seals is you will
[1:38:40] be blaspheming
[1:38:42] let's go to luke chapter one you there
[1:38:45] you know the story zechariah
[1:38:48] stay on the surface there is a lot of
[1:38:49] stuff loaded stay on the surface
[1:38:51] everybody okay
[1:38:53] verse eight and it came to pass
[1:38:56] that while he executed or performed the
[1:39:00] priest office before god in the order of
[1:39:03] his course
[1:39:05] this is zechariah he was of the course
[1:39:08] of ebay which was the eighth course
[1:39:11] leave it alone everybody okay
[1:39:13] verse nine according to the custom of
[1:39:16] the priest office
[1:39:19] his lot was to burn water
[1:39:22] the father of john the baptist
[1:39:25] when he went into the temple of the lord
[1:39:30] everybody okay
[1:39:31] you have not caught it yet
[1:39:33] now you're going to catch it verse 10
[1:39:35] and the whole
[1:39:36] multitude
[1:39:38] of the water where are the people in the
[1:39:42] other court or in the holy place
[1:39:44] in the holy place only the priest
[1:39:47] entered there
[1:39:48] and the high priest alone the
[1:39:50] congregation stayed on there outside
[1:39:53] where the pharisee and the publican was
[1:39:56] ever here so everybody is on the outside
[1:40:00] of the other court before the president
[1:40:03] and zechariah the priest
[1:40:06] enter into the water
[1:40:08] holy place so there is a sacrifice
[1:40:11] burning outside
[1:40:13] and the people are praying but on the
[1:40:15] same time the sacrifice is burning
[1:40:18] outside something is activated in the
[1:40:21] holy place
[1:40:24] everybody okay verse 10 and the whole
[1:40:27] multitude
[1:40:28] of the people were doing water
[1:40:31] outside at the time of water
[1:40:34] so when you are praying here outside
[1:40:39] on the inside the altar of jesus is
[1:40:43] activated
[1:40:46] everybody okay
[1:40:48] when elijah is praying at the evening
[1:40:51] sacrifice elijah knew that when they
[1:40:54] were burning the evening sacrifice there
[1:40:57] is a priest inside there that is also
[1:41:00] burning the incense
[1:41:02] everybody here so between the other coat
[1:41:06] and the holiest there is a space of time
[1:41:09] that always involve prayer
[1:41:14] and prayer is an element that is also
[1:41:18] seen in the holy place
[1:41:23] what are you trying to say brother
[1:41:25] stephen so when zechariah is there an
[1:41:28] angel appeared to him
[1:41:31] [Music]
[1:41:34] what is going on brother stephen
[1:41:36] the bible says in luke chapter 11 if he
[1:41:40] then
[1:41:40] being evil
[1:41:43] brother robert got it again
[1:41:45] know how to go with good gift unto your
[1:41:48] water
[1:41:50] how much more
[1:41:53] shall your water
[1:41:56] give the water
[1:41:58] holy spirit to them that do what
[1:42:05] everybody okay
[1:42:07] elijah built the altar
[1:42:10] but elijah have to ask
[1:42:17] for the fire to come down
[1:42:21] when solomon asked the fire came down
[1:42:29] the holy ghost is given
[1:42:32] to them
[1:42:33] they ask him
[1:42:35] [Music]
[1:42:40] you need a prayer life
[1:42:43] [Music]
[1:42:48] everybody okay
[1:42:50] at five and we are his witnesses of
[1:42:53] these things
[1:42:55] and so is also the holy ghost comer
[1:42:59] whom god
[1:43:01] has given to them that the water
[1:43:04] so
[1:43:05] according to the scripture not only do
[1:43:08] you ask but you must do what
[1:43:10] i have done everything according to your
[1:43:14] word
[1:43:17] now i am asking
[1:43:20] jesus taught the disciple
[1:43:23] on act one he said being assembled
[1:43:25] together with them he commanded them
[1:43:28] that they should not depart from water
[1:43:31] but do what
[1:43:33] they have to obey to wait
[1:43:40] wait for the water the promise of the
[1:43:44] father which he said you have heard of
[1:43:46] me they have to wait for the holy ghost
[1:43:50] and that wedding must be with obedience
[1:43:56] so what we think is when they went in
[1:43:58] the upper room they sat down like this
[1:44:01] the bible said in verse 14 they all
[1:44:04] continue with one accord in water
[1:44:10] so their wedding was combined with
[1:44:13] prayer
[1:44:16] the disciples were justified
[1:44:20] the disciples were already sanctified
[1:44:23] but before the holy ghost came they have
[1:44:27] to obey jesus christ and not only obey
[1:44:31] but stay in an atmosphere of prayer
[1:44:38] everybody okay
[1:44:39] prayer and supplication with the women
[1:44:43] and marry the mother of jesus and with
[1:44:45] his
[1:44:46] water between the other coat
[1:44:50] and the holiest you must go to a time of
[1:44:53] prayer
[1:44:55] everybody okay so we found act 2 38 here
[1:44:58] and when we go back in the tabernacle
[1:45:01] and we begin to convert this in the
[1:45:03] tabernacle we find out that we have the
[1:45:06] level
[1:45:07] we have the present altar the first part
[1:45:10] the second part
[1:45:12] repent be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:45:14] christ
[1:45:15] and you shall
[1:45:17] ever hear
[1:45:18] you understand now receive the gift of
[1:45:20] the holy ghost
[1:45:22] or justification
[1:45:25] sanctification
[1:45:26] baptism of the holy spirit roof deciding
[1:45:30] hoof serving
[1:45:31] roof water
[1:45:33] roof
[1:45:34] coming into the tabernacle we are in
[1:45:37] justification
[1:45:39] we talked about the present altar we're
[1:45:41] trying to get into the level so we can
[1:45:43] move on
[1:45:45] everybody okay
[1:45:47] when roof approaches the president
[1:45:51] roof says that
[1:45:53] naomi said that sister-in-law is going
[1:45:56] back onto her people unto her god
[1:45:58] returned that after that sister-in-law
[1:46:00] we talked about it
[1:46:02] and ruth said
[1:46:04] entreat me not to leave them or to
[1:46:06] return from following after thee
[1:46:09] for without that ghost
[1:46:11] hour ago in judah where the lord yes i
[1:46:14] would love in bethlehem
[1:46:16] that people the jews shall be my people
[1:46:20] and that god shall be my god not our god
[1:46:24] where that dies the death
[1:46:27] i will die whether buried the burial
[1:46:30] i will be buried and the burial speak of
[1:46:32] the resurrection and there and the lord
[1:46:35] do so to me and more also if ought by
[1:46:38] death part d and me
[1:46:41] when she saw
[1:46:43] that she was steadfastly minded she was
[1:46:46] very decided
[1:46:48] sincerely to go with her then she left
[1:46:51] speaking unto her so naomi could not let
[1:46:56] anybody follow her
[1:47:00] if she's not sure
[1:47:02] you made up your mind
[1:47:05] everybody here because naomi was holding
[1:47:10] a secret
[1:47:11] of the light of the lineage of the
[1:47:15] messiah
[1:47:19] do you know that
[1:47:21] and limerick was of the image of jesus
[1:47:24] christ
[1:47:25] and that lineage you have to be kept a
[1:47:28] certain way pure
[1:47:29] so before you can hop into that energy
[1:47:33] you must make proof of what you have

[1:52:22] to that relationship
[1:52:24] you came because of a husband die to
[1:52:28] that that death is going to separate you

[1:52:38] you're cutting off with daddy and mommy
[1:52:41] and you hooking yourself to god
[1:52:44] but you still love your mommy and daddy
[1:52:48] you must die to the thing that brought
[1:52:51] you you pentecostal people
[1:52:53] to where you are this afternoon you
[1:52:55] gotta die to it samson was willing to
[1:52:58] pay the price to get the power of god
[1:53:01] back in his life again i wonder if the
[1:53:04] church is this afternoon willing to pay
[1:53:06] the price and die with the enemy
[1:53:09] they think
[1:53:10] all your popularity
[1:53:17] your friends that love you on facebook
[1:53:20] ever here and all this and that the
[1:53:23] other just to see the power of god back
[1:53:26] on you again and become a prisoner of
[1:53:29] jesus christ
[1:53:32] everybody here
[1:53:34] now they think of it is the people are
[1:53:36] now willing to pay the price to get back
[1:53:39] to that i believe that god just remained
[1:53:41] the same as he ever was
[1:53:43] but they think of it is the people has
[1:53:46] got so wound up into the world and the
[1:53:49] world in them till they just got enough
[1:53:52] religion to make them miserable
[1:53:58] not enough to really turn loose to god
[1:54:01] and give your whole heart to him but
[1:54:03] enough yeah i go to church certainly i
[1:54:07] enjoy good singing and clapping hand
[1:54:09] yeah i love that see it is more than
[1:54:12] that
[1:54:14] ever here
[1:54:16] ever here the trouble of it is the
[1:54:19] church today is not like samsung they
[1:54:22] are not willing to pay the price samsung
[1:54:25] prayed
[1:54:28] right when he prayed
[1:54:30] lord let me die with the enemy
[1:54:33] he know he was going to cost him
[1:54:36] something
[1:54:38] that's why david said i will not
[1:54:40] sacrifice unto my lord something that
[1:54:43] doesn't cost me
[1:54:46] ever here he knows he was going to cost
[1:54:49] something it's going to cost you
[1:54:51] something it's going to cost me
[1:54:53] something your social prestige
[1:54:58] your place
[1:55:00] and position in the denomination
[1:55:02] lord let me die then i see your purpose
[1:55:06] he know he was going to cost him
[1:55:08] something you must be ready to die out
[1:55:12] to your enemy
[1:55:13] to get the blessings of god
[1:55:16] samson was willing to pay the price to
[1:55:19] get the power of god again upon him he
[1:55:22] was willing to do it
[1:55:24] are you
[1:55:25] are you willing to sacrifice your water
[1:55:34] you want to sacrifice that netflix
[1:55:38] are you you know it used to be wrong for
[1:55:40] us to go to the movie
[1:55:43] but now the devil put one over you
[1:55:46] brought it right in your water
[1:55:48] now you have it on your cell phone
[1:55:51] are you willing to die to that
[1:55:53] married sister are you willing to die to
[1:55:56] that
[1:55:59] [Music]
[1:56:00] hallelujah
[1:56:02] hallelujah
[1:56:03] why is it
[1:56:05] because the price you pay
[1:56:08] has a consequence
[1:56:13] everybody here
[1:56:15] the price you praying and the president
[1:56:19] will open the door for you or lock the
[1:56:23] door for you
[1:56:27] there is a power of decision there is a
[1:56:30] time of decision and there is a result
[1:56:32] of decision whatever you do in this
[1:56:35] altar if if it was not done with
[1:56:38] sincerity
[1:56:41] your progression is hindered
[1:56:47] brother branham says this
[1:56:49] we know that this is justification
[1:56:52] this is sanctification this is the
[1:56:54] baptism of the holy ghost brother
[1:56:56] branham says this
[1:56:58] he said
[1:56:59] and the life that was in the stock
[1:57:02] went
[1:57:03] yes
[1:57:05] and one went to make the other
[1:57:09] are you following me
[1:57:10] i'm following you
[1:57:12] whatever
[1:57:13] you start here
[1:57:16] everybody here
[1:57:18] we'll open the next stage
[1:57:28] justification
[1:57:29] made way
[1:57:34] you okay now
[1:57:35] for
[1:57:36] sanctification and sanctification
[1:57:39] make way for the baptism of the holy
[1:57:42] ghost and the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:57:45] make way so whatever you start here is
[1:57:49] very important
[1:57:52] if this step is wrong
[1:57:54] it's going to block everything down the
[1:57:57] road
[1:58:02] if these things are not taught that's
[1:58:04] why we bring people at the altar they go
[1:58:06] and tomorrow they fall they go and
[1:58:08] tomorrow they fall and they don't
[1:58:10] understand why they can't have the
[1:58:12] victory whatever started here
[1:58:15] was not genuine
[1:58:17] but here because naomi made sure
[1:58:21] that roof before you continue with me i
[1:58:24] must make sure you are stripped
[1:58:26] completely
[1:58:28] and roofs say by confession i am
[1:58:30] denouncing my country i am dismissing my
[1:58:33] people i'm denouncing my family i'm
[1:58:36] denouncing everything that i hold dear
[1:58:38] oh in all my life since i was born till
[1:58:41] now all of them i left them on i'm going
[1:58:44] to a different land your god will be my
[1:58:47] god your people will be my people in
[1:58:49] other words the wolf have changed
[1:58:51] citizenship
[1:58:54] amen
[1:58:55] open roof chapter 2
[1:58:59] roof come after the judges
[1:59:03] hallelujah
[1:59:05] let's go to ruth chapter 2.
[1:59:10] if you dare you can say amen
[1:59:13] for those who worry about time i'm good
[1:59:21] because some of you take 10 20 minutes
[1:59:23] i'm full
[1:59:25] and you take three hours of netflix
[1:59:27] you're not hungry
[1:59:34] have you seen kids watching tv four
[1:59:36] hours
[1:59:37] they keep watching watching watch and
[1:59:39] they don't want to stop
[1:59:40] you stop them they go back again cannot
[1:59:42] watch
[1:59:48] anybody here
[1:59:49] roof chapter two
[1:59:52] and naomi roof already took a decision
[1:59:55] she's moving and naomi had the kinsmen
[1:59:59] of her husbands
[2:00:01] a marry man of wealth
[2:00:04] did ruth knew about this man
[2:00:08] of the family of who
[2:00:10] elimelech the lineage of jesus christ go
[2:00:12] to matthew 1 you're going to see it
[2:00:14] and his name was boaz
[2:00:17] everybody okay
[2:00:19] and roof there more by test say to naomi
[2:00:24] let me go to the field stay on the
[2:00:27] surface
[2:00:29] who told the roof to go to the field
[2:00:34] did somebody tell them
[2:00:38] who said to who
[2:00:41] normally who should have told somebody
[2:00:44] naomi knows the law of israel
[2:00:48] naomi should be the one saying roof get
[2:00:50] up
[2:00:52] how are you doing fix yourself
[2:00:55] this is a new country welcome
[2:00:57] to america
[2:00:59] when you come here there is a way we
[2:01:00] behave
[2:01:02] we are widows
[2:01:04] god have provided something and
[2:01:06] according to the word of god
[2:01:08] you need to rise up and go
[2:01:10] after the the reapers over there and go
[2:01:13] there and follow them and get food
[2:01:15] that's what naomi was supposed to do
[2:01:18] anybody care
[2:01:19] but naomi never done that
[2:01:23] why because the decision of ruth
[2:01:28] gave her a citizenship
[2:01:32] outside of the natural blood
[2:01:40] are you following me
[2:01:41] a normal jew that was born jew by blood
[2:01:45] must know the law
[2:01:47] by the jew that is born by spiritual
[2:01:51] that bloodline is under melchizedek
[2:01:57] everybody here
[2:01:59] nobody will teach them
[2:02:01] anything
[2:02:02] but all will know me say the scripture
[2:02:07] jesus said in that day paul said no one
[2:02:10] will teach one another
[2:02:12] because the father is seeking for true
[2:02:15] worship
[2:02:16] not in jerusalem not in samaria those
[2:02:19] that are going to worship him in spirit
[2:02:21] and in what
[2:02:23] and paul expanded he said it will come
[2:02:26] of a time that all of us will be taught
[2:02:29] of
[2:02:30] god you won't call your friend that say
[2:02:34] come and teach us about the lord because
[2:02:36] all of us will know god
[2:02:38] it is not a priest telling you
[2:02:41] but it's a different bloodline
[2:02:44] and that blood instructs you what to do
[2:02:48] nobody told the roof but the decision
[2:02:51] roof took here
[2:02:53] everybody
[2:02:54] changed the roof
[2:02:56] into a different citizenship
[2:03:00] and when she changed ruth
[2:03:03] he activated the royal blood of jesus
[2:03:07] christ
[2:03:10] everybody okay
[2:03:11] and the wrong blood of jesus christ
[2:03:15] get the automatic give in your life
[2:03:19] he make you do things
[2:03:21] you don't understand why
[2:03:24] [Music]
[2:03:26] everybody okay
[2:03:27] and one day you will find that it was
[2:03:30] written in the bible but you didn't know
[2:03:33] he was in the bible when you were doing
[2:03:35] those things
[2:03:41] everybody here
[2:03:42] everybody clear
[2:03:43] everybody here
[2:03:45] one time
[2:03:47] my my wife took my child isaac it was a
[2:03:50] baby everybody go beautiful baby
[2:03:52] beautiful baby beautiful baby beautiful
[2:03:54] she went i don't know until the week or
[2:03:55] whatever appointment and someone look
[2:03:58] and say you know what
[2:03:59] if you want we can take a picture of
[2:04:01] your baby
[2:04:02] and we can put on the diapers
[2:04:05] and you're going to be paid money and
[2:04:07] everything for lifetime every time they
[2:04:10] use it for lifetime my wife came and
[2:04:12] told me that i said no
[2:04:16] i could be a millionaire but this time
[2:04:17] right
[2:04:19] and most of you some of you would have
[2:04:22] jumped into it brother stephen it's just
[2:04:24] a picture of a baby
[2:04:26] i want to get money the root of all evil
[2:04:33] when it happened i was not a dentist
[2:04:39] because you will say that you are a
[2:04:41] dentist that's why you didn't mean money
[2:04:43] i was not a dentist yet my wife is there
[2:04:46] so it was a very good opportunity for me
[2:04:49] to make money passive income and unpaid
[2:04:53] every time the diaper has been sold in
[2:04:55] america i say no
[2:05:02] everybody okay
[2:05:04] one day
[2:05:06] i was reading brother branham
[2:05:10] and i fell into a court
[2:05:13] brother branham spoke about the brother
[2:05:16] that they call to use a picture of his
[2:05:19] daughter to put in a diaper or something
[2:05:21] like that and the brother got very upset
[2:05:25] he said that was an insult for her
[2:05:28] brother for for for his own child
[2:05:31] i didn't know they court when i say that
[2:05:34] but i come to find out later on
[2:05:37] what i was doing was according to the
[2:05:40] message of the hour
[2:05:46] when your beginning is good
[2:05:49] it's going to transfer you
[2:05:52] into melchizedek
[2:05:54] and when merchandise take off your life
[2:05:58] nobody told the roof you need to go over
[2:06:01] there it was roof telling naomi that hey
[2:06:04] it's over there in the morning i'm gonna
[2:06:06] go over there naomi probably look he say
[2:06:09] this woman is something
[2:06:12] i told her to stay over there she
[2:06:14] doesn't want to stay i don't know why
[2:06:16] she learned these laws
[2:06:22] here who told the roof
[2:06:25] you need to go after the reaper because
[2:06:27] the law of moses already put it there
[2:06:30] roof did not know the law
[2:06:33] ruth did it like by instinct
[2:06:37] what activated the spiritual instinct
[2:06:41] is the genuine decision that you took
[2:06:44] here
[2:06:47] everybody okay so far
[2:06:49] if this alter is genuine
[2:06:52] if you give your life to god genuine and
[2:06:55] you mean really business
[2:06:58] melchizedek will take you over
[2:07:01] [Music]
[2:07:03] anybody okay
[2:07:04] but if still you still doing it because
[2:07:07] you want to do it but you want to hold
[2:07:09] certain things in your life
[2:07:11] are you doing it to please your father
[2:07:13] so daddy will see that now my child is
[2:07:16] is a good child and everybody going back

[2:07:20] today i'm so glad you say yes now we're
[2:07:22] gonna get all the favor from daddy he's
[2:07:24] gonna open all the doors

[2:07:42] corn after him
[2:07:44] of whose side
[2:07:46] i i found what
[2:07:49] look at the language of this woman
[2:07:52] where did she learn grace
[2:07:54] who taught her grace
[2:07:57] and she said to her grow my daughter

[2:08:34] what you call hazard
[2:08:36] what you call by chance
[2:08:40] you call it like that
[2:08:42] but melchizedek doesn't see it like that
[2:08:46] but here because once you make it right

[2:18:00] be on the field that they do what
[2:18:05] everybody okay

[2:18:16] everybody okay
[2:18:17] because under the vision of brother
[2:18:19] branham
[2:18:20] of the third pool ever here first of all
[2:18:23] they put a lure
[2:18:25] on the hook you remember and they cast
[2:18:28] it there it's usually the little fish
[2:18:32] ever here that goes after it's the
[2:18:35] maiden that goes
[2:18:37] because there is a movement
[2:18:38] back here so the third roof check the
[2:18:41] movement of the maiden
[2:18:43] check the little fish ever here when you
[2:18:45] pull the hook
[2:18:47] over here the load of fishes will begin
[2:18:49] to follow the hook
[2:18:51] and he gives he get the attraction of
[2:18:54] the rainbow trout
[2:18:56] to see the maiden
[2:18:58] so the telling roof
[2:19:00] follows another fishes
[2:19:02] when they go it means there is movement
[2:19:05] going on
[2:19:12] did i lose somebody
[2:19:13] do you know what i'm talking about
[2:19:15] you know what i'm talking about the

[2:19:31] when you see without for going on then
[2:19:34] the rainbow trout begin to go everybody
[2:19:36] here
[2:19:37] everybody here you go after them after
[2:19:40] the maiden
[2:19:41] have i not charged you the young men
[2:19:44] shall not molest you touch you
[2:19:47] so you see a pastor sleeping with women
[2:19:49] in the church get out of that church
[2:19:54] [Music]
[2:19:56] and when you are thirsty go to the
[2:19:59] vessels
[2:20:00] and drink of that which the young men
[2:20:03] have drawn
[2:20:06] verse 10
[2:20:08] then she fell on her face and bow
[2:20:10] herself to the ground and say why have i
[2:20:14] found in your eyes that you should take
[2:20:18] knowledge of who
[2:20:20] singing i am what
[2:20:24] why am i receiving all this stuff
[2:20:28] everything i'm doing is working why
[2:20:31] since i gave my life i pray it happened
[2:20:33] i pray it happened i pray it happened
[2:20:36] boy i say let me explain you what
[2:20:37] happened
[2:20:38] what happened the reason why you're
[2:20:41] receiving all of this is because of what
[2:20:43] happened in the brazilian altars
[2:20:46] watch verse 11
[2:20:48] and boys answered and said here he was
[2:20:51] fully shown me
[2:20:54] he was fully being showed me everybody
[2:20:56] here
[2:20:57] all that you have done to your
[2:21:00] mother-in-law since the death of
[2:21:02] elimelech
[2:21:05] elimelech was not your husband he was
[2:21:08] your father-in-law since the death of
[2:21:10] your own husband
[2:21:12] not naomi's husband your first husband
[2:21:15] was dead
[2:21:17] you were free you could go
[2:21:19] back and do whatever you want to do
[2:21:21] anybody here
[2:21:23] and how you have left your water
[2:21:27] forsaken all right everybody okay
[2:21:30] and left yahoo
[2:21:32] forsaking all
[2:21:34] and the land of your water
[2:21:36] nativity and now come to a people which
[2:21:39] you knew not before the lord recompense
[2:21:43] your work
[2:21:44] and a full reward be giving you of the
[2:21:47] lord god
[2:21:49] of israel under who's what
[2:21:52] you are come to do what
[2:21:54] so according to boaz what you did here
[2:21:58] you were putting yourself under god
[2:22:02] that's why things are happening the way
[2:22:04] they are happening because you didn't
[2:22:06] trust anymore on yourself you put your
[2:22:09] trust into the jehovah under the wings
[2:22:12] of the jehovah that's why everything is
[2:22:16] automatic
[2:22:17] that's why you came later in the message
[2:22:21] but you are moving faster than the
[2:22:24] children that were born in the message
[2:22:29] because the children that were born in
[2:22:31] the message never done this but you were
[2:22:34] prostituted you came from the street and
[2:22:37] you're moving faster and you're going to
[2:22:39] get the holy ghost because you trusted
[2:22:42] not in your parent religion but that
[2:22:45] parent religion became your own religion
[2:22:48] that's why god is opening the way
[2:22:50] quickly
[2:22:53] [Music]
[2:22:55] the decision that the president
[2:22:58] is very important because your
[2:23:00] justification will open make way to your
[2:23:03] sanctification everybody okay
[2:23:05] then roof move from there to the water
[2:23:09] she say where i'm buried
[2:23:12] you bury me
[2:23:13] the burial spoke about the resurrection
[2:23:16] it is the death the burial and the
[2:23:18] resurrection which which is symbolized
[2:23:20] in the world of baptism let's get this
[2:23:22] and then let you go home
[2:23:24] you there
[2:23:25] brother branham say watch
[2:23:27] when i baptize people
[2:23:30] and you minister take this for an
[2:23:31] example
[2:23:32] i have taught those people
[2:23:36] until they had that life cleanup
[2:23:42] am i reading another quote
[2:23:44] before they went to the water
[2:23:50] that's why benecosta misses it
[2:23:53] everybody here and i had them believing
[2:23:56] that god was obligated to keep his
[2:23:59] promise
[2:24:00] as soon as there was baptized in the
[2:24:03] name of jesus christ the holy spirit was
[2:24:06] right there
[2:24:07] to receive it and when they came up out
[2:24:10] of the water they received the holy
[2:24:12] ghost brother bradham said the key is i
[2:24:15] stood with them and i taught them so
[2:24:17] much
[2:24:18] until as soon as i put them in the world
[2:24:22] come out the holy ghost is in them
[2:24:24] how are we baptizing people in the
[2:24:26] message
[2:24:29] how
[2:24:30] one day we baptized 42 people
[2:24:33] one day we baptized 30 people come down
[2:24:36] out come down look at their lives after
[2:24:38] buttons
[2:24:41] anybody here
[2:24:42] shepherd teach your sheep
[2:24:45] get them in the bible here
[2:24:47] brother branham pat in his bible
[2:24:50] ever here get away from the old textbook
[2:24:55] not the message
[2:24:57] the old textbook from the denomination
[2:24:59] of some churches and get down here in
[2:25:02] the bible where god taught
[2:25:05] and you won't have those water
[2:25:08] do you see why we have trouble in the
[2:25:09] message
[2:25:10] how are we baptized but young people get
[2:25:13] so enthusiasm as soon as two are
[2:25:15] baptized i'm gonna be right baptized
[2:25:17] also boom i'm gonna be re-baptized also
[2:25:19] boom i'm gonna be and we came up there
[2:25:21] we say praise the lord the young people
[2:25:23] are touched this morning we baptize 25
[2:25:25] of them tomorrow living like devil
[2:25:28] sleeping with men
[2:25:33] everybody here
[2:25:34] everybody here
[2:25:36] what is baptism in the level but for us
[2:25:40] also to whom it shall be imputed if we
[2:25:43] believe on him that raise up jesus our
[2:25:46] lord from the dead
[2:25:48] who was delivered for our offenses and
[2:25:51] was raised again for our what
[2:25:55] knowing not that so many of us as were
[2:25:58] baptized into jesus christ were baptized
[2:26:02] into his what
[2:26:03] so the baptism here is only an
[2:26:07] expression of what happened right here
[2:26:15] what happened at the brazen altar is
[2:26:19] supernatural
[2:26:21] what happened in a president
[2:26:24] is completely invisible
[2:26:28] the present alter work
[2:26:30] is an inward work
[2:26:33] even though we speak by confession
[2:26:36] and that work is invisible
[2:26:40] nobody knows whether you really accept
[2:26:42] it or not
[2:26:44] we only saw you at the altar
[2:26:47] so to give us a proof
[2:26:51] that you really accepted it you need to
[2:26:54] come to the water
[2:26:57] when you go in the water we look at you
[2:27:00] like this man really mean business
[2:27:03] that's why naomi stood up and stayed
[2:27:05] quiet she said when i where i would die
[2:27:08] where i would baptize where i would be
[2:27:10] buried that's it she got baptized let's
[2:27:12] go i'm not going to say anything anymore
[2:27:15] i got it ever here
[2:27:17] therefore we are buried with him by
[2:27:20] baptism into death
[2:27:23] that like as christ was raised up from
[2:27:25] the dead
[2:27:27] by the glory of the father even so we
[2:27:30] also should walk in the newness of life
[2:27:32] for if we have been planted together in
[2:27:35] the likeness of his death we shall also
[2:27:38] be in the likeness of his water that's
[2:27:40] why we are bearing whoop and come up
[2:27:43] everybody okay
[2:27:46] hang tight
[2:27:47] what is going on
[2:27:48] else what shall they do which are
[2:27:51] baptized for the dead
[2:27:53] that death is not plural
[2:27:57] anybody here
[2:27:58] if the dead rise not at all why are dead
[2:28:02] dead baptized for the dead why do we
[2:28:05] baptize for the dead that dead is
[2:28:06] singular
[2:28:08] brother branham say
[2:28:09] paul speaking here was talking of the
[2:28:12] dead jesus christ
[2:28:14] if the dead was not why are you baptized
[2:28:17] in jesus christ's name then if the dead
[2:28:20] was not
[2:28:21] but he goes ahead and glorified god for
[2:28:24] the glory for the resurrection of the
[2:28:26] dead and we are baptized to jesus christ
[2:28:29] unto his death
[2:28:32] whereas where you die i will die
[2:28:34] unto his bear
[2:28:36] where you bury up your berry and this
[2:28:38] water
[2:28:39] that is why we baptize unto the death
[2:28:44] i have not called it yet brother stephen
[2:28:46] let me help you up
[2:28:48] they like figure where unto even baptism
[2:28:52] dude also now save us
[2:28:55] not the putting away of filth of the
[2:28:57] flesh
[2:28:58] but the answer of a good water
[2:29:02] conscience toward who
[2:29:04] but the rage by the resurrection of who
[2:29:08] now i believe that you are saved by
[2:29:11] accepting jesus christ
[2:29:13] brazen altar and water baptism is an
[2:29:16] outward expression
[2:29:19] to show that something
[2:29:21] inwardly invisible has happened because
[2:29:25] water have no virtue it's just a water
[2:29:28] it doesn't clean you up
[2:29:31] it is just a proof to us
[2:29:33] that you really mean business
[2:29:36] everybody okay

[2:31:23] we know it's about paul
[2:31:26] and as he journeyed he came near
[2:31:28] damascus
[2:31:30] and suddenly
[2:31:31] there shone around about him a light
[2:31:34] from heaven
[2:31:35] and he fell on the earth and heard a
[2:31:37] voice saying to him so so why are you
[2:31:41] persecuting me everybody
[2:31:44] and he said
[2:31:46] who are you
[2:31:47] lord
[2:31:50] yes paul is asking the light
[2:31:53] who are you
[2:31:55] anybody here
[2:31:56] and the lord that light say
[2:31:58] i am jesus whom you persecute it is hard
[2:32:02] for you to kick against the priests
[2:32:05] everybody okay
[2:32:06] and he trembling and as
[2:32:09] astonished saying lord what will you
[2:32:12] have me to do
[2:32:14] and the lord said to him arise and go
[2:32:16] into the city and it shall be told you
[2:32:19] what you must do
[2:32:21] number one paul
[2:32:23] was a hedge
[2:32:25] it was a header of jesus christ
[2:32:28] he hated jesus and he hated the people
[2:32:31] the
[2:32:32] uh preacher jesus christ he hated
[2:32:35] christians
[2:32:36] you need to get this very good because
[2:32:38] when we when we will get to ezekiel
[2:32:40] about giving you a new heart you will
[2:32:42] understand what it means i have to go
[2:32:44] through all those avenues and right here
[2:32:47] so at first
[2:32:49] the disposition of paul was wrong toward
[2:32:52] jesus christ
[2:32:56] everybody okay when i will get to
[2:32:58] ezekiel you will be jumping happy
[2:33:01] back here
[2:33:02] number one
[2:33:04] zero paul
[2:33:07] was
[2:33:08] had a wrong disposition
[2:33:12] a wrong disposition
[2:33:14] toward christ
[2:33:16] he hated christ hey
[2:33:18] but when christ unfolded to him
[2:33:23] into an experience
[2:33:26] this experience
[2:33:28] did not give paul the holy ghost
[2:33:36] can i repeat again
[2:33:38] paul saw the pillar of fire
[2:33:40] he spoke with the peter of fire the
[2:33:43] penal fire spoke back to him but he
[2:33:46] didn't receive the holy ghost
[2:33:51] oh when i was a child i saw a pillar of
[2:33:53] fire when i was talking i was a period
[2:33:55] when i was eating the pillar of fire
[2:33:58] doesn't mean you received the holy ghost
[2:34:02] what was the purpose of this experience
[2:34:06] you okay
[2:34:08] when paul asked he said who are you
[2:34:11] he said i'm jesus
[2:34:13] you hating everybody that carried my
[2:34:15] name i am that person
[2:34:17] that you heading i am he
[2:34:20] paul's turn around he say lord
[2:34:23] who are you
[2:34:25] i never understood that the pillar of
[2:34:27] fire was you

[2:42:52] a brother without the holy ghost
[2:42:58] ananias calling brother because he

[2:43:12] holy ghost yet
[2:43:16] brother so and so brother son so no holy

[2:44:06] sight
[2:44:07] and arose and was what
[2:44:13] paul they sent me by your boss
[2:44:17] for you to be
[2:44:20] everybody okay filled with the holy
[2:44:22] ghost when paul received the holy ghost
[2:44:26] paul miss
[2:44:29] and paul did
[2:44:30] what everything finished any question
[2:44:37] any question
[2:44:39] let me skip some of them quickly
[2:44:42] let me skip some of them
[2:44:44] quickly because of the form of the time
[2:44:47] let's go to act chapter 10.
[2:44:50] second example
[2:44:52] amen
[2:44:56] brother bronham say i believe paul the
[2:45:00] reason that he had to be baptized again
[2:45:03] is he did what
[2:45:07] everybody okay
[2:45:10] i have chosen him a vessel to the gender
[2:45:12] god knew that ananias will be able to
[2:45:15] baptize him in the name of jesus christ
[2:45:18] in the damascus river three days later
[2:45:20] but i believe his sin were already
[2:45:30] the message and the bible are
[2:45:33] [Music]
[2:45:35] everybody okay
[2:45:36] paul by by just this experience
[2:45:39] they took away that sin away everybody
[2:45:42] here but he doesn't have the holy ghost
[2:45:44] yet
[2:45:47] everybody okay
[2:45:48] everybody okay
[2:45:49] but he had to do this brother kalima to
[2:45:53] show to the
[2:45:55] because they know him a bad boy we need
[2:45:57] to see you in the water you got the holy
[2:46:00] ghost fine get in the water so
[2:46:03] because the water is our proof that you
[2:46:05] change go back in the water everybody
[2:46:08] here and i believe that the reason that
[2:46:10] we must be baptized in the name of jesus
[2:46:13] christ and i believe the predestinated
[2:46:15] seed will see it they have to baptize
[2:46:17] him so when he came out of the water
[2:46:19] everybody dropped their weapon
[2:46:21] they say he's a brother
[2:46:23] pull him inside let's go to the
[2:46:24] restaurant he's a brother

[2:52:15] and they said to the baptist mofu
[2:52:18] john then say paul john verily baptized
[2:52:21] with the baptism of repentance saying to
[2:52:23] the people that they should believe on
[2:52:24] him which should come after that is on
[2:52:26] christ that was the first baptism but
[2:52:29] the progression already moved you have
[2:52:31] to move with the second provision amen
[2:52:34] so something is a glitch there what is
[2:52:36] going on and when they heard this
[2:52:40] they didn't feel like they were not
[2:52:42] believers
[2:52:43] they didn't think that their pastor was
[2:52:45] telling them you are not christian
[2:52:48] they obey in the state where they were
[2:52:51] and they begin to correct that state to
[2:52:54] move forward
[2:52:56] everybody okay and when they heard that
[2:53:00] this they were water
[2:53:02] ah
[2:53:03] we are here on number two there were
[2:53:05] water
[2:53:06] now can we check this
[2:53:08] so we got one two three what is
[2:53:09] remaining
[2:53:11] let's see if the holy ghost comes
[2:53:13] they were baptized uh they were baptized
[2:53:16] in the name of the lord jesus christ and
[2:53:18] when paul had laid his hand upon them
[2:53:21] the water
[2:53:27] everybody okay
[2:53:28] paul cornelius emphasis
[2:53:32] three
[2:53:33] go to act eight
[2:53:35] and we finish here
[2:53:37] i can get you to the court
[2:53:39] go to act eight
[2:53:41] you there
[2:53:42] if you're there you can say amen
[2:53:46] actor chapter eight
[2:53:49] verse nine
[2:53:50] everybody here
[2:53:52] but there was a certain man called
[2:53:54] salmon
[2:53:56] which before time in the same city use
[2:53:59] water
[2:54:00] was this man for christ or against
[2:54:02] christ
[2:54:05] brother kelly
[2:54:07] he used sorcery
[2:54:09] and bewitched the people of samaria
[2:54:12] giving out that himself was some great
[2:54:14] one
[2:54:16] to whom they all gave hid
[2:54:18] from the least to the greatest the whole
[2:54:19] city saying this man is the great power
[2:54:22] of god
[2:54:23] do you see how people give the power of
[2:54:25] the devil sometime that the power of god
[2:54:27] ever
[2:54:29] and to him
[2:54:30] they they had regard because that for a
[2:54:33] long time he bewitched them with
[2:54:35] sorceries
[2:54:36] everybody here
[2:54:37] you there
[2:54:39] watch now verse 12 deadly thing
[2:54:42] but when they did what
[2:54:45] can i check number one
[2:54:47] can i check again
[2:54:48] let me raise this again
[2:54:51] they did what
[2:54:54] repentances were here
[2:54:56] were they baptized
[2:54:58] were they baptized
[2:55:00] let's go down the checklist when they
[2:55:01] believe philly preaching
[2:55:03] the thing concerning the kingdom of god
[2:55:06] and the name of jesus christ come out
[2:55:08] they were
[2:55:09] everybody okay now
[2:55:11] everybody okay now
[2:55:13] what remains
[2:55:14] prayer and what
[2:55:17] let's see
[2:55:18] they were baptized
[2:55:20] both men and women then someone himself
[2:55:23] did what
[2:55:25] believe also and when he was baptized he
[2:55:28] did what
[2:55:31] someone the sorcerer believed and was
[2:55:34] baptized the other people also believe
[2:55:38] and were baptized but when you believe
[2:55:41] you must be careful if you really
[2:55:43] believe it or not because your believing
[2:55:46] will open up the way to the other
[2:55:48] stages
[2:55:50] everybody okay
[2:55:51] let's see what happened
[2:55:54] and wondered beholding the miracle and
[2:55:57] what
[2:55:58] which we were which were
[2:56:01] when someone believed
[2:56:03] and were and was baptized his mind was
[2:56:07] only about the miracle
[2:56:10] oh he's praying for the sick they are
[2:56:12] here
[2:56:14] it's all about miracle
[2:56:16] that's what attracted him
[2:56:21] everybody okay
[2:56:22] verse 9
[2:56:24] the verse 14 now when the apostle which
[2:56:27] were jerusalem heard that samaria had
[2:56:29] received the word of god they said to
[2:56:31] them who
[2:56:32] peter and john who when they were calm
[2:56:35] down
[2:56:36] pray for water
[2:56:39] that they might receive the water
[2:56:42] for us yet
[2:56:44] they were not receiving the holy ghost
[2:56:46] yet i want you to have that in your mind
[2:56:50] for as yet he was not fallen upon none
[2:56:54] of them
[2:56:56] they believed god they were baptized but
[2:56:58] nobody have the holy ghost how many
[2:57:00] people have the holy ghost in the
[2:57:02] message
[2:57:05] do you see why we got trouble that we
[2:57:06] get in the message
[2:57:08] just because somebody believed the
[2:57:09] message
[2:57:11] ever here
[2:57:12] none of them they were baptized in the
[2:57:15] name of jesus christ
[2:57:16] then lay dead their hand on them and
[2:57:20] they received the what
[2:57:22] can i check this or two
[2:57:25] but let's see salmon
[2:57:28] everybody here
[2:57:30] verse 18 and when someone saw
[2:57:33] that through the laying of the hands of
[2:57:36] the apostles
[2:57:37] the holy ghost was given he offered them
[2:57:40] what
[2:57:44] the president although was wrong
[2:57:47] he blocked him because the holy ghost
[2:57:50] fell but he didn't receive it
[2:57:54] everybody received it not him
[2:57:56] because your president is wrong now his
[2:57:59] mind was about making money because he
[2:58:02] was making money before by sorcery
[2:58:05] now he was looking at the power that he
[2:58:07] can use for for money again
[2:58:13] but here
[2:58:14] saying verse 19 give me also this power
[2:58:18] that on whomsoever lay hand he may
[2:58:21] receive the water
[2:58:22] and peter said to him your money perish
[2:58:25] with you
[2:58:26] he wants money all the time
[2:58:29] what is your disposition what are you
[2:58:31] looking for
[2:58:33] money money money
[2:58:37] money minded
[2:58:39] don't go to church money don't do this
[2:58:41] over time over time
[2:58:46] don't worry about your spirituality
[2:58:49] ever here your money perish with you
[2:58:52] because you have thought that the gift
[2:58:54] of god may be purchased with money
[2:58:57] you need a have part no lot in water
[2:59:02] by predestination we can see now
[2:59:05] that you don't belong to this
[2:59:07] ever here
[2:59:09] everybody else went through this except
[2:59:12] someone last
[2:59:14] drop to verse
[2:59:16] 27
[2:59:17] and now finish here
[2:59:20] first paul second cornelius three
[2:59:24] disciple of ephesus four salmon
[2:59:28] father
[2:59:30] the utopian eunuch
[2:59:34] and he arose and went and behold the men
[2:59:36] of ethiopia a eunuch of great authority
[2:59:39] under camden's queen
[2:59:41] of the ethiopian who had the charge over
[2:59:44] all his treasure
[2:59:45] and he had come to jerusalem for to do
[2:59:48] what
[2:59:49] was he the believer
[2:59:51] can i check this
[2:59:53] was he baptized
[2:59:56] did they receive the holy ghost
[3:00:02] you there

[3:01:44] see you talking outside
[3:01:46] in desire philip that he would come up
[3:01:49] and sit with him
[3:01:51] the place of the scripture where he read
[3:01:53] was this he was led as a ship to the
[3:01:56] slaughter like a lamp you know what it
[3:01:58] is it's isaiah hey
[3:02:00] jump to verse 34. and the unique answer
[3:02:03] peter and say uh philip and say i pray
[3:02:06] you of whom the prophet say uh
[3:02:09] the prophet this speak this of himself
[3:02:12] or of some other
[3:02:15] he was reading the prophet
[3:02:17] he have a problem
[3:02:19] decoding whether the prophet was
[3:02:22] preaching about himself
[3:02:24] or the prophet was preaching about
[3:02:26] christ
[3:02:29] [Music]
[3:02:33] reading the message of the hour
[3:02:35] [Applause]
[3:02:37] oh that was just the opinion of brother
[3:02:39] branham you have a difficulty if brother
[3:02:42] branham is really talking about himself
[3:02:45] or he's talking about somebody else
[3:02:51] this message
[3:02:53] beautiful
[3:02:55] beautiful my friend
[3:02:57] you see but that's why brother branham
[3:02:59] said this is where you have a difficulty
[3:03:02] separating the two
[3:03:06] when brother branham turned the back is
[3:03:08] he talking about himself or is he
[3:03:10] talking about somebody
[3:03:16] many believe in the message
[3:03:19] everybody here
[3:03:21] then phillip opened his mouth for folk
[3:03:24] ministry anointed and distracted by god
[3:03:27] not any far from ministry philip had the
[3:03:30] holy ghost
[3:03:34] ever here and began at the same
[3:03:37] scripture and preached to him who isaiah
[3:03:40] was talking like he was him
[3:03:44] but philip could decode that it's not
[3:03:47] him behind what you see there he's just
[3:03:50] a son it is jesus christ
[3:03:54] this message is not brother branham this
[3:03:57] message is jesus christ
[3:04:02] [Music]
[3:04:04] you need to look beyond the flesh
[3:04:07] and see jesus christ in this message
[3:04:11] this message is crossed
[3:04:15] [Music]
[3:04:17] you're not feeding on the word of a man
[3:04:20] you're not feeding on the word of
[3:04:21] brother branham we are fair feeding upon
[3:04:24] the unfailing body world of the son of
[3:04:27] man
[3:04:28] when we say brother branham say it is
[3:04:31] jesus christ
[3:04:38] your husband is the revealed world
[3:04:42] not the man he was a carrier but the
[3:04:45] jesus christ that brother brown i'm
[3:04:47] introducing

[3:07:03] buffing the water
[3:07:05] not sprinkling
[3:07:07] buff
[3:07:08] philip and the eunuch and he did water

[3:07:28] champion and then and the spirit called
[3:07:31] him away and that unit saw him no more

[3:07:39] moving that's it
[3:07:41] game over
[3:07:43] five example

[3:08:45] you want to know about it
[3:08:46] let's stand there
[3:08:53] with everything you taught brother
[3:08:55] stephen
[3:08:56] should that be re-baptized again
[3:08:59] because now i understand
[3:09:02] now
[3:09:03] that i went to this altar
[3:09:05] i didn't know what i was doing
[3:09:07] should i be baptized again
[3:09:09] somebody's trembling
[3:09:12] i already did it good
[3:09:15] brother branham say
[3:09:17] if you have been a christian all along
[3:09:21] since you was 13 years old
[3:09:24] a believer in christ
[3:09:26] i would just remain like you are
[3:09:28] i would not now if god has blessed you
[3:09:31] and give you the
[3:09:34] don't do it again
[3:09:37] the baptism is only a form to show the
[3:09:40] world or the congregation
[3:09:43] that you are with at that time that you
[3:09:46] before witnesses prove that you have
[3:09:48] believed that god sent his son and died
[3:09:51] and rose again on the third day and you
[3:09:53] was buried in him and have reason to
[3:09:55] walk in the newness of life and the same
[3:09:58] people that watch you when you was
[3:10:00] baptized will meet you at the judgment
[3:10:03] if your life has been good god gave you
[3:10:05] the holy ghost don't do it but you say
[3:10:08] brother bill did you ever baptize
[3:10:10] anybody over who had been baptized when
[3:10:12] there was a little fellow and they've
[3:10:13] been rebaptized
[3:10:15] many times
[3:10:18] now there is a scripture in revelation
[3:10:20] they say repent and do your first work
[3:10:22] brother branham corrected this he said
[3:10:24] he was not talking to the individual he
[3:10:26] was talking to the church that's wrong
[3:10:28] you can read it but random say i'm not
[3:10:30] disagreeing with this because we have
[3:10:32] got baptistry filled we are ready to
[3:10:35] baptize anybody that wants to be
[3:10:36] baptized any time if you want to be
[3:10:38] baptized if that is something that is
[3:10:41] standing in your way and you feel like
[3:10:43] you should be
[3:10:44] you go do it that's right you got to do
[3:10:47] it don't let nothing stand in your way
[3:10:50] you make yourself perfectly clear
[3:10:53] what are you saying brother stephen by
[3:10:55] this
[3:10:56] if you have taken something years ago
[3:10:59] and you feel like you should go make it
[3:11:00] that right you got to make it right no
[3:11:03] matter what it is you keep everything
[3:11:05] clear because you shall come up to that
[3:11:07] thing and you can't go any further till
[3:11:09] you get that out of the way see you just
[3:11:11] got to lay aside every weight and the
[3:11:14] thing that so easily beset you if you
[3:11:17] want to be baptized again go ahead
[3:11:19] that's the thing to do i have baptized
[3:11:22] many over but if you want to be baptized
[3:11:25] you was baptized when you were 13 or
[3:11:26] whatever age why you want to be baptized
[3:11:29] if it is on your way
[3:11:31] what are you talking about brother
[3:11:32] stephen brother brother say if you have
[3:11:35] been if you have been redeemed and you
[3:11:36] feel that the blood of jesus christ
[3:11:38] cleaned you from sin then i would live a
[3:11:41] christian life i wouldn't think it would
[3:11:44] be necessary
[3:11:45] the man that baptized me in the name of
[3:11:47] the lord jesus christ finally run me out
[3:11:49] of the church because i would not agree
[3:11:51] with him on women preachers that didn't
[3:11:53] make me
[3:11:54] be re-baptized again
[3:11:58] what brother bradham is saying if you
[3:12:00] are living a christian life since you
[3:12:02] got baptized you don't have to do it
[3:12:04] over
[3:12:06] you've seen through all the example
[3:12:08] baptism is essential even if you got the
[3:12:10] holy ghost you miss it they go back to
[3:12:11] you to give it to you but brother
[3:12:14] brother is saying that if you feel a
[3:12:15] condemnation in your heart
[3:12:17] that is telling you you must correct
[3:12:19] certain things
[3:12:21] if you feel it yourself you need to go
[3:12:22] corrected but if there is no
[3:12:24] condemnation everything is good you
[3:12:26] continue in your life
[3:12:28] everybody
[3:12:29] let's pray heavenly father
[3:12:31] lord we thank you for your grace your
[3:12:33] love and your mercy and for everything
[3:12:35] you have been doing for us
[3:12:37] father i'm sorry i took a little bit
[3:12:39] more of the time but i have to grant
[3:12:41] this thing to the people so that they
[3:12:43] can see the plan of salvation clearly
[3:12:46] because with confusion people have been
[3:12:49] locked and the devil loved it and locked
[3:12:51] the people in different states where
[3:12:54] they can see no victory they try with
[3:12:57] their might they don't see anything
[3:12:59] happening in their life and the more
[3:13:01] they have tried for years father they
[3:13:03] get discouraged and they don't want to
[3:13:05] fight anymore because they're confused
[3:13:08] but lord you send your word to correct
[3:13:11] the error you gave us the precious word
[3:13:14] that would come lord and clear
[3:13:16] everything all the smoke away so that we
[3:13:19] can see clearly what we're talking about
[3:13:21] and we can't understand now by
[3:13:23] justification
[3:13:24] did we come to the altar the right way
[3:13:27] did we come by emotion did we get here
[3:13:30] because of a family
[3:13:32] did we get here because of a certain
[3:13:34] benefit like some on the sorcery
[3:13:36] did we come here which way did we come
[3:13:39] did we repented right did we confess our
[3:13:42] self right did we accepted the person of
[3:13:45] jesus christ
[3:13:46] have we died at the brazen altar have we
[3:13:49] been stripped from our families our
[3:13:52] countries our colleagues our uh uh
[3:13:56] association all these things have we
[3:13:59] forsaken all
[3:14:00] are we in the point that everything in
[3:14:03] our life have been giving the
[3:14:04] preeminence to you
[3:14:07] have we been baptized right
[3:14:10] have we make that decision correctly
[3:14:13] if it's so
[3:14:15] where is the holy ghost
[3:14:17] and if we have done it correctly father
[3:14:20] it is time for us to go to
[3:14:22] preparation to get into prayer
[3:14:26] to pray
[3:14:27] like elijah to pray
[3:14:29] like solomon to pray like paul was
[3:14:32] praying to pray like the disciples were
[3:14:35] praying in the upper room
[3:14:37] further waiting and praying so that that
[3:14:39] holy spirit can come and seal this faith
[3:14:43] and complete the work of redemption and
[3:14:46] then we can look up and to adoption
[3:14:48] further i commit everything that was
[3:14:51] spoken onto the hand may you help this
[3:14:53] church may you help your children to
[3:14:56] search themselves
[3:14:57] father may you help them move all
[3:14:59] foolishness away
[3:15:01] the gas price is out of control the war
[3:15:03] that started we don't know where it is
[3:15:05] going to stop it's shaking everybody
[3:15:08] and despite everything people still
[3:15:10] waste time arguing on facebook debating
[3:15:13] on message stuff instead of looking at
[3:15:15] the clock of god and seeing and checking
[3:15:18] if their lives and their families are in
[3:15:20] order with god to meet you into the air
[3:15:23] father the midnight cry have came
[3:15:25] already but how many have the second oil
[3:15:28] that they can meet you into the air lord
[3:15:31] may you help this congregation and
[3:15:33] whoever was not here that nobody will be
[3:15:36] left behind but that it's time that they
[3:15:38] can trim their life
[3:15:40] shake everything away and may we move
[3:15:43] forward
[3:15:44] further and get into the holiest lord we
[3:15:46] humbly ask it and commit everything unto
[3:15:49] the hand father remember the sacrifice
[3:15:51] to go over with time lord just to make
[3:15:54] sure they get the point correctly we ask
[3:15:57] it in the name of jesus christ
[3:15:59] amen god bless you church we love you
