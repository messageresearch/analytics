problem i've got most of them saved but this last verse is reversed in a lot of books and i've got the reversal of what this is that's why i was singing it like was but it's okay amen in a nobler sweeter song will sing thy power to save when this poor tongue see it's not on here when this poor lisping stammering tongue lies silent in the grave amen praise the lord amen all glory to god this morning amen so we have two specials but i wanted to give um we've got two birthdays as well i want to give the lord um you know a hand for those i want to i want to give a little testimony i came home uh tuesday night from work i had a pretty stinky attitude i just wasn't feeling good i didn't wasn't really treating my family right and uh um and uh you know and then i got up tuesday morning i have a pastor in uh in uganda that sends me a quote and he sends me a scripture every morning so i got up tuesday and the scripture was hebrews 10 35 cast not away there for your confidence which hath great recompense of reward and he made it he quoted out of sirs we would see jesus and let me read the bottom of the quote anyways it says and may i go on record just now now this is wednesday morning may i go on record just now saying that i believe that the right mental attitude okay toward any divine promise of god will bring it to pass okay so i'm like okay that's on time and then we tune in on the streaming for wednesday night service and here comes brother kelly with the same line of thought so you know that's why that's why in a portion i chose the songs that i did okay because how great thou art okay no denying that one feel my way with love no more stinky attitude the right mental attitude i'll be listening because he was definitely speaking to me wednesday okay because i'm one of them right and then that verse about the dying thief though there may i though vile is he so i don't think any of us are without a stinky attitude every once in a while but to have two people one on each side of the world come back and vindicate this you know god used both of them in my life to tell me you know just try to get a better attitude in life so i'm listening okay and um god is good so

brother david can you give me a little bit more let me blast that devil [Laughter] amen what a fight we've been through people are getting delivered lives has been changed people are getting healed some are already under ambushed because we are chasing that devil out you don't know what god is doing in this church amen she said loreal did you mention my name when you were singing you didn't know why right it won't take too long before some of you begin to speak in tongue and interpret here and some of you will begin to see vision just consecrate a little bit you're going to see amen since friday i was in a fight for some reason i don't know what happened tommy egg going on going on since friday i say i am going to preach amen and yesterday i went into prayer i was praying praying and the anointing fell i say okay everything is fine so he's gonna leave and he didn't i went to bed woke up at 4 00 a.m and go to bed and woke up and my wife was like what is going i say everything will be all right i went to the recliner woke up this morning keep going keep going when i came to church this morning my wife called brother john and said brother john you need to pray for him i pulled brother kelly up there i said brother kelly you pray for me he prayed like nothing happened like i was in perfect health i say wait a minute i didn't hear brother kelly chasing out any demon or something amen and he prayed like everything is all right he even told me he said everything is all right i say okay praise the lord i came back there i could not even bend amen when brother john step here and begin to pray i just felt that i know ending coming on the right side amen [Laughter] [Applause] do you know what happened once he hit me on the right side i begin to bend and i begin to move i'm like what is going on the whole thing lifts up and i'm perfectly fine [Applause] amen that's why it's important to come to church there is an anointing in the church that can remove sickness away we praise god for the presence of the holy spirit amen brother kelly thank you so much brother john thank you in church thank you for praying i'm all right now [Laughter] amen we serve a living god thank you very much musician now i feel like i am back to what i was [Laughter] blessed be the name of the lord i hope the screen is clear it seems to be tilted it will be but hopefully everything is fine with you praise be the name of the lord hallelujah i know what i was praying for sister loreal and no wonder the anointing hits you i know exactly where it's coming from just get consecrated a little bit the gift that you were born with will unfold and god is going to quicken it and before you know it you're going to see things that you've never seen in your life amen and those that have their gift already activated you're going to be seeing something more clear and clear and clear and clear either you take part of it or you're going to be a spectator i don't want to be a spectator i want to be right in the middle of it amen let's go to isaiah chapter 3. we read this last week could not even get into it amen my god i wish the entire church was here because i'm going to lay a principal here that's going to help you up through all the avenues of the black dog amen yeah i could continue we we stopped at their pants at the eyes how many listen to that sermon okay praise god yeah if i continue the devil might make you struggle a little bit so let's lay down the foundation so you understand everything will blend into what we're going to speak amen isaiah chapter 3. there is something that those who are going to stay in tune with catching and when you catch it it's going to help you get that road easy because i can't speak that on youtube before brother robert put me in order [Laughter] he's usually the one that put me in the order in that one amen praise be the name of the lord remember we have the building fund today the building fund offering at the end of the service we are overdue for our house meeting so you need to start working on your question and answer there are certain question and answer answered is somebody who asked me a question i told him to make a time to talk to me because i cannot answer that over the phone or through texting i want to go through but what i'm going to lay down today is going to automatically help you up i can preach it here i'm not afraid of it but brother spoke about it but there are certain things that are going to be local i am not an international pastor amen the ministry is for the broad international but the office is local amen yeah if i preach that the way i see it before i leave here the links are will fly away but i will nail it with the scripture amen so some of those questions we gotta talk somebody asked me last week i believe if we can put a theme to our titles on youtube so i would talk to brother david in other words we're going through part 23 24 25 and we keep going but sometimes if you want to go back and refer to certain things that we spoke you have to search it all around so what they asked me see they say but stephen if there is a possibility maybe uh part 23 you can call it nail and high heel so when you put that team there [Laughter] don't worry my brother don't worry my sister just stay in tune we're going to help you out i i just came nailing high heels amen so when you're searching for some quotes or some scripture about it instead of going through 10 sermons you can go straight ahead and say the team is there this is what we talk about all this is about the black dog or something like that it would take a little time but brother david can work it up everybody clear i hope i didn't scare somebody isaiah 3 we're going back to the foundation of the fathers you don't want power without character isaiah 3 verse 8. sorry just understand me you feel better to be here you don't know what i was feeling at home and how i'm feeling now completely here amen blessed be the name of the lord verse 8 for jerusalem is roon and judah is fallen because their tongue and their doings are against the lord that's why they're failing to provoke the eyes of his glory verse 9 they show off their countenance in other words if you look at the look of their face that's weakness against them and they declare they're seen as sodom right here you can see that the scene of sodom was not a scene that was done in secret it was done publicly like i say back in the day when somebody was homosexual they used to hide they don't want anybody to know but now transgender homosexual they don't hide nothing they're just coming up straight ahead and this is fulfilling the prophecy amen they hide it not in other words they're not even ashamed of it they think it's normal and they want to poke that normality in our children in our wives in our family but we refuse it because it's against the word of god amen i'm not refusing it because it's my opinion we need to make a difference with that i am not against it because it's my preference i am not against it because it's against my feeling i am against it because it's against the world amen once you zero everything to the word to the message of the hour then that word will be above your feelings above your preference above your opinion because some people take their opinion about the word of god their only vindicated opinion is the opinion of brother branham not your opinion only the message of the hour because he's god's mouthpiece everybody clear verse 16 moreover the lord said because the daughter of zion can you imagine i was at home i i took a drink to get some energy and the drink caused me more trouble now i'm thirsty [Laughter] let me drink water that devil don't worry the black dog moreover the lord said because the daughters of zion you might be seated those daughters are hardy you know what it means they are proud and walk we've stretched forth next so there is something that make this daughter of zion walk differently there is something that the daughter of zion have that make their neck being outstretched i hope you're going to open your heart and be humble enough to release whatever you have as a right and let the world change you amen if not he's going to bump and go back again but he will not return void when he bumps against you he goes back it turns into judgment everybody clear and stretch forth their next and one turned eyes in other words seductive eyes we talked about that last week i'm going to start from there and take off what makes the eye seductive everybody clear walking and messing as they go how can somebody without shoes walk and mess or twist no there is something that is making this woman twisting that's in between the land it takes a profit to reach out to that and pull it out amen and messing as they go and making a tinkling with their feet if you take your shoes off and you walk here sister even if you walk on a parking lot are you going to make noise no there is something that if you put while you're walking it's going to make noises you will hear kaka and the second thing will be the bracelet of the ankle it's in description amen let's go to first thessalonians 5. we under the territory of the black dog just bear with me once we finish this then we're going to stop backing up to the surface first thessalonians 5 22 you should be even remembering this everybody clear you there verse 21 prove water are you proving all things how do you prove all things what is your caliber what is your measurement it's strange you're telling somebody i do everything by the way they say well do you tell me you do everything by the word yes yes prove all things hold fast that which is what so if it's not good what do you do to it put it in the trash let it go verse 22 abstain from all appearance of water so god does not want you to look like evil what determines what is evil and what is not evil because when you are living in your old life you thought what you were doing were good it took the light of the world to show you that what you were doing was evil so the one determining what is evil is not you it is the word it is the message of the hour that's going to tell you what is evil and what is not evil because that is god provided way for the day amen let's go to hebrew chapter 11 then we're going to pray oh my god blessed be the name of the lord it feels good to be in church you seek come to church you're going to get here amen hebrew chapter 11 if you dare you can say amen verse eight few people still few people okay now we're fine by what by faith abraham remember abraham left the land of the caldins you remember by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after received for an inheritance it was a future inheritance he obeyed obeyed and he went out not knowing where he went how can god tell you leave your family leave your country leave everything go you don't even know where you're going it takes revelation verse 9 by faith his sojourn in a land of promise as in a strange country so when god told abraham live where you are go to where i'm going to show you the lord directed the foot of abraham to the promised land when abraham reached in the promised land everybody can even imagine that oh abraham can say well this is the place that god wants me to live so i can rest here but there was something in the life of abraham even though he reached the promised land abraham walk in that promised land as a stranger anybody clear as in a strange country dwelling in water tabernacle instead of abraham getting there and building a building of concrete abraham was acting like he have not reached the place yet or god told him to leave from egypt to canaan he get to canaan but abraham was living in canaan like he have not reached his objective yet are you following me he was in the world in egypt in egypt 100 black dog 100 black dog you understand then he moved to the promised land when he reached the promised land 100 on the inside white dog and the outside is still black dog that's why abraham was living like he was a stranger because there was another place that abraham need to get in that place it's a hundred percent white dog and a hundred percent white dog do you want me to repeat it again did i lose anybody okay praise the name of the lord let me say it somebody might be struggling i would add a man in a man can you see that okay when you are in egypt in the world you are sinner on the outside black dog on the inside black dog 100 when god called you out amen he's separating first the inner man are you there then he bring you to the promised land which is the message of the hour when you get into canaan in the promised land then the outside is still black dog but the inside is a white dog you still have to fight in the promised land that's why brother branham said the promised land is not the millennium because in the promised land the black dog is still dead which is a type of the baptism of the holy ghost but your body is still struggling that's why abraham was living as a stranger in other words even though abraham is confronted but he is careful about the land he's living around are you following me even though you are born again you must be careful about the kingdom of the world because there is another land that you must go but in thailand for you to go the black dog must be kicked out so when you enter into that land everything else will be white and white then you can get in the millennium then you can get in the new jerusalem everybody clear so far blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah he should not even have bothered me amen verse 9 by his surgeon in the land of water how can you live in a printer land or promise as a stranger you should be resting you should say oh this is my finality abraham understood that was not funnel that was just a process into finality where is the process as in a strange country dwelling in water tabernacle with isaac and jacob the hair with him of the same water so everybody that is connected to that promise whether it's jacob whether it's isaac they always live in the tent everybody that is joined into the baptism of the holy spirit because by one spirit we are all baptized into one body once you get in the promised land automatically the world becomes stranger to you everybody clear why was he dwelling like that abraham verse 10 for he did what abraham why do you look for something else when god brought you in the promised land god said leave aye god to be abraham left a went to be god say i'm gonna give you b as your promised land what else do you look for you need a prophet you need a prophet at the opening of the seventh hill this bible become anew let's go verse 10 for he did what for what he was looking for a cd why do you look for another city abraham why there was a city here that was called jerusalem that existed already but when abraham got into this city he met the king of jerusalem who was melchizedek are you there when abraham talked to melchizedek they said mckinsey was the king of salem so melchizedek had the city but that city was not an earthly city because melchizedek was a theophany [Applause] are you there jerusalem existed already when mercy i came he was the king of what jerusalem so abraham probably thought oh so you're the king of that city mechizadek said no that is not my city then abraham begin to look for a water a city what kind of city hallelujah verse 10 for he look for what a city which has water who's what and what is what the new jerusalem jerusalem that was existing here was built by men but abraham was looking for a city that is not touched by men the making of the city and the entire building of that city is made by who in other words when abraham was here his eyes opened here are you following me once you are called from egypt it's gonna open the mystery of the promised land when you are in the promised land the holy ghost will open a mystery to a different direction the holy ghost will never make you feel like you homer he will always remind you that this world is not your home amen when trouble comes when politic disappointed you when your friend disappoints you when your family disappoints you when everybody disappoints you then the holy spirit says the reason why it happened because we are not there yet are you there a city which has foundation this is a message laying right here that is lingering because there is 12 foundation to that city it's in the book of revelation and they have the name of the apostle and the name of the patriarch which gives you the 24 elders it's laying right here hallelujah they've seen who's building and maker is who verse 11 through faith also sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she did what she considered she judged him who who had the part the promise drop now to verse 13. hallelujah these all all these people died in water so some of them slept but in this age not everybody was sleeping some will not sleep at the trumpet of god the voice of direct angel some people will be alive that are not going to slip these all died in water where did they get that faithful anybody clear not having received the water the promises but having water vision they understood there is a city somewhere there is an objective we need to reach and where persuaded of them indeed what how did they impress it they were looking far off hallelujah indeed what and confess that they were water how can you be stranger in the promised land you see now there were stranger and what how can you be a temporary resident in your inheritance you see now and pilgrim on the water so they understood something else verse 14 for today there had such things which means the people that are having their mindset the people that have caught the vision the people that understood that we are not at the final point yet you understand when those that have such things declare plainly that they seek a weapon so by having the vision you are actually testifying to people that i am looking for my destination verse 15 and truly if there have been water of the country from where they were in other words when you leave egypt you follow me you must burn the bridge remember holy bar in our holla you understand so when they left egypt and they came in the promised land their mindset their thinking was constantly about this city do you follow me this city was calling for them are you there because in here they have mentions are you there they have physical mention and spiritual mention theophany and tiofani are calling are you following me are you following me and paul is saying that if their thought was about this this is why israel get in trouble when they move in the wilderness we remember the fishes we ate in egypt when they moved a little bit we remember the water in egypt so their mind was completely from the country where they came from let's go back and truly if they had been mindful of that country from where they came out right here if they were always thinking about it if you are always thinking about the world if you are always thinking about that church from where god pulled you out do you understand me do you understand me do you understand me that's why you must burn the bridges you must separate them if constantly you are still tempering with the dog church from where god pull you out okay i hope you are catching them and truly if they had been mindful of that country from where they came out it might be the world it might be denomination it might be a a message church inverted cameras are you there if they were mindful of that country from where they came out because every country have a spirit by principalities you remember they might have water had the opportunity to do water so when you are constantly thinking about where you came out actually you are listening to the black dog pulling you back again while god is moving forward somebody is pulling you back there is a city calling you backward and there is also a new jerusalem calling you forward galatians 4 verse 26 but jerusalem which is what not this jerusalem but the one where melchizedek is the king so there was enough free jerusalem and uh anybody clear that jerusalem which is above his water that's why you have freedom by the baptism of the holy ghost it cuts you completely loose come on which is the word so that seed is your mother a city is a woman a city is a church ephesus is a woman in church come let me show you the bride the city when you look at that bride it was a city but that seed is your mother it is giving birth so when you get birth here born again here something happened in that city go in the church ages of sardis go read the name put on the book of life you're gonna see that there is a record in psalm 89 if i'm not mistaken where they are taking record of those that are born in zion god's church your message but jerusalem which is above his word which is the mother of water the mother of azor so when you are born from here into jerusalem you are born by your mother jerusalem birthed you by the baptism of the holy spirit and then that jerusalem is not represented here it is a heavenly jerusalem not this earthly so that city is pulling is calling you back because that's where you belong and one of this day there will be a city coming down from heaven to sit then you're gonna find your house there you're gonna find your address your house furnish and everything that's where you're gonna live for eternity let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again father for your grace for your love for your mercy and also for your deliverance and for your healing this morning father thank you for your presence being in the midst of us lord we are committing again this service unto the hand father may you take all the glory may the devil be completely sealed out may only the holy spirit and the angel of the lord be sealed in father may you give revelation to your children those that are present here and those that are streaming lord father may you break every spirit of rebellion every spirit of resentment every spirit of unbelief all kind of spirit that's going to block the word lord for being effective into the life of your children lord we embrace it and commit everything unto the hand in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you we are on port 24 we're gonna find out about the team later on in the message who do you say this is okay brother brother say here is a woman standing here i am a young man waiting to get married she meet my specifications in every way she is a lovely christian she looks like one she looks like one she looks like one she dresses like one brother not only the look of the face she must look like a christian she must dress like a christian and she must act like water like a christian because you must abstain from all appearance of what evil she lives like one i shall admit she'd make me a good wife but she's not mine until i take her for mine so you can't claim her to be your wife until you get married to her then you can call her this is my wife and then she can call you this is my husband brother branham say that is the way the message is are you there you can say the message is beautiful you can say the message is good you can say the message makes sense you can say that you like the message until you get in union with the message the message is not yours yet that is the way with the they made the way the message is you can do it you can sympathize with it and say it's right but you got to take it yourself to become water part of it then you and the message become water so what we are preaching here that is coming from the bible and that is coming from the message of the hour it will not help you if you don't take it when then you and the message become one when you and the message become one what happened then the anointing is with you do you follow me as it is with the water in other words when they are preaching the word and you are receiving that word the anointing that comes with that word will also come on you and make you become what that word has been preaching are you there because the spoken word is the original water and every seed must reproduce according to its own so for you to become the message you must receive the message then the spirit of the message will come and help you be the message you become what you eat ever clear if you open your mouth to swallow it let's go to ezekiel 23 when we were last week amen hang tight and you're going to get it i wish those that are missing will come and get this because it's going to avoid them a lot of headache in the future especially those that are not married ezekiel 23 are you there when we went to ezekiel 23 we already talked about a hola we went to a holy bar and from a holy bar we dropped down to verse 36 let's go to verse 40. to save time because you already know the other one verse 40. and furthermore remember holla and a holy bar left egypt and they went to the promised land but they never forgot about egypt are you there then when the thinking of egypt was constantly in their mind the devil gave them another substitution for egypt which was the assyrian that was close neighbor and the assyrian took them and pulled them back again to where they came from starting at zero verse 40. and furthermore after they got polluted and everything and furthermore that you have sent for men to come from far these men that are coming from far are the sabbaths i can give you a scripture you need it you see me after church there is a scripture where the bible say the serbians are the people that live far off so she called for sabbats because her mind she had the egyptian in mind and the bible says that the egyptian was man of great flesh here in other words the anatomy the morphology of the egyptian were more prone to sexuality so she must match somebody she must find somebody else even though egypt is a little bit far off she's going to find somebody else that's going to replace what she had in the past and if you study the scripture you will see that the savage were men of great stature they were giant i have the scripture if you want me to to whom she sent a message a messenger was sent and lord they came for whom you did wash yourself everybody come on painted your eyes and deck yourself with what ornament so right here we can see that the purpose of this birth taking the purpose of painting her eyes and the purpose of decking herself with all kind of was because she wanna meet a lover anybody clear the purpose of her other appearance their purpose they aim their vision is to please man everybody clear you follow me so sometimes you might be putting something on you innocently but that those things are made by the devil to attract men lord help me and take yourself with ornament and sat upon a stately bed very luxury and a terrible prepared before me where upon you whereupon you have set my incense and my old and a voice of multitude being at ease a party going on was with her and with men of common sword a well-brought serbians if you look at the word serbians they are drunkers so she brought drunkers everybody clear from the wilderness which put bracelet upon their hand we already told you young people men don't put bracelet and beautiful crown upon their heads right here we can see that there is a door that has been opened to worldliness ahola and a holly bar were pulled out of the world now they are back into the world the daughter of zion were already living in israel but the prophecy of isaiah 3 is saying that those daughters will begin to behave like sodom brother branham said we read this last week this is the major sin of our days it's the major sin among our people which is what wilderness as the bible says laodicea said she is welcome so we are dealing with an age of worldliness now let's go to proverbs chapter 6 this is where we stopped last week if you dare you can say amen proverb chapter 6 then we're going to take off if you can allow me tom let me lay what we have you there verse 24 if you dare you can say amen to keep you from the water so in proverbs chapter 6 there is a woman and that woman is what she's evil she's not a good woman she doesn't act like a christian she doesn't live like a christian she doesn't even look like one am i clear because the bible calls her evil all right to keep you from the evil woman from the flattery of her tongue of the tongue of a strange water so not only is she evil but she covered this evil with everybody flattery she's so sweet but she's not really sweet she's bad she's gonna be bad when she is in your home then you're gonna see her colors she's gonna be bad when you leave your parents house and you begin to live on your own apartment and you begin to live with her as a boyfriend and girlfriend then you're gonna see her color but when she's looking for you she's covering herself that bad character with flattery everybody clear mama is straight she's sweeter than mama anybody clear verse 25 what is that word lust we have read a lot of time where the bible say lust and daughter lust and daughter it's the same word lust is not to appreciate are you there there is a difference between lust and appreciation are you there you can look at the flower and you say that's a beautiful flower you can look at a sister and you've never seen her and you seen her the first time you say wow that sister is beautiful you are not lasting anybody many times women sisters will see a younger sister coming from another church they can look at her and they say wow she's beautiful you're gonna hear she's gorgeous look at her she's pretty that is not lasting everybody lasting is usually connected with a sexual desire are you are you following me what can a woman wear [Music] instead of you appreciating her what she put on turn you on if you don't understand this you won't understand what the scripture is saying if a sister is beautiful she wear a beautiful dress and she goes back and forth you can put her in front of a nightclub you can put her everywhere you want to if a man look at that woman they will tell you why she's praying and that's it amen when man appreciate that they have no desire to have sex with her everybody there is something a woman must do to turn men from appreciation to lust are you following me because there are four types of love we have a gap in love remember that we have failure love we have lust full of and we have what filthy love young sister when you want to get married are you there don't attract your husband through this door you following me make sure what attract men towards you is not the lustful love are you there man must attract you by failure do you follow me when somebody look at you she's a beautiful woman then the thoughts come she can i can get married to her the man is right here everybody follow me then he goes to a girl payloaf you follow me and he's going to ask agape love agape love is this the right woman for my life you follow me you follow me then agape will give you his family whether that is the myth of your life or not if agape say no you still love her but not to be your wife are you following me you're not going to hate her every time you see her you say man that woman is beautiful you are not even ashamed to tell your wife that that woman is beautiful are you following me when our gap say yes this is your wife then you go back and you talk to her are you there but an immoral woman an evil woman is on this category here everybody clear so the door she open is not a door to a gap in love that's why your boyfriend and girlfriend relationship fell are you there because they were based on to last for love are you there let's go back to the scripture last not after her what can you see a natural woman beautiful and when you see her you begin to laugh stuff for her go even call a drunker and tell him to look at the sister which is well dr well dressed and everything it doesn't click in their mind to last after a woman like that are you there last not after her beauty in your heart why in your heart remember matthew 5 28 who so looked upon a what a woman and lasted after her in a water how can you look at a woman and lasted after her brother branham said the reason why it happened is because that woman presents herself a certain way to cause men not to appreciate her but to laugh stuff to her one day brother brandon asked me that me to ask brother branham she said brother branham you were married before with hope hope died and you got married to me when we go to heaven are you there between me and hope who is gonna be your wife sister mida was thinking about filio because here there is jealousy everybody clear she want to hold brother branham to herself she said now when we go to heaven we're going to be two people with you so who is going to be us brother branham say let me give you an example brother obama said if you see a woman coming and hugging me a sinner what are you gonna do she said i won't like it feel it filio are you there brother branham said take me out of the picture and put jesus christ if mary magdalene comes and fell in the feet of jesus and begin to hug and kiss jesus would you like it or not yes you're gonna like it he said now you are no more in philly you are now in agape because in agape you don't think again the same way are you there you don't you will be even appreciated like okay she came to her maker are you following me now what is going to make a man look at a woman and last brother branham say it is because of the way the woman present herself there are almost four to five things that a woman can do to cause a man to last after her you ready number one she must expose part of her flesh everybody following me anybody following me number two a woman have to wear something that is tight her shape or her form are you following me number three she can wear something that cover her body but you can see through that that is what you have like laces sister you see a sister in a message wearing a long lessons here but you can see through the lessons all the way here when the garment you are wearing is like a veil somebody can see through you must put something under it do you follow me it is not a matter of being long but your body must be protected everybody following me the fourth thing is to wear high heel just relax high heel will give a woman a temporary shape that is not the shape she was born with i'm gonna prove to you just relax with me everybody clear and number five is when a woman wear a garment that pretend to men you want me repeat it again when a woman does these kind of things she is automatically dropping under restful love you follow me when men look at you because you expose your breasts because you expose your time automatically it is no longer an appreciation it turned into a lust because what you did is creating a sexual appetite to the man the man begin to long to have sex with you not longing to have you as a wife it's just that the traveler came straight on and he's trying to appease the travelers but he doesn't want anything to do with you that's why you see people changing women one after the other today he's here he broke a relationship he changed broke a relationship he changed broke a relationship insurance because he has been provoked by women anybody understanding me let's go to verse 25 last not after her beauty in your heart neither let you let her take you with her water how can a normal woman i lead take you that's why a holla and a holly bar when men are coming to them they have to paint their eyes to cause men to last after them because they already lasted after the men so they wanted those men to be turned on as soon as they get on because they are already burning and they want to satisfy their burning so they must wear something that can cause a man to drop in their category do you follow me hallelujah jeremiah chapter one this is the principle i'm gonna lay and i want you to really catch this you ready buckle up as we're going up now jeremiah 1 verse 5 before i formed thee in the belly i did what i know you if you're sleeping you need to wake up and before that chemist out fourth are fourth out of them of the womb are sanctified and are ordained a prophet unto nation let's go back again before i do what so before you are conceived in your mother's womb god knew you if you're sleeping you need to wake up now before you are what you are here god in his mind already have your picture you understand me god already knew the texture of your skin i'm going slowly god already knew whether you're going to be tall or short are you following me god already knew whether you're going to be filled or fat are you following me god already knew where your curves are going to be you follow me so what you are today doesn't impress god are you there before god begin to manufacture you in the womb of your mother god already finish you up do you follow me in the mind of god oh god if i can slow time in the mind of god you are a finnish product do you follow me this is in the man of god so when god finished discerning you in his mind so god sit and he said this is brother chose and he look he say i want him to be disturbed i want him to have this texture i want his eyes to be like this then god is working on his computer when god finished it up god take a usb and load it the word made flesh and we are actualizing that today so you understand are you there when you are conceived in your mother's womb god bring the usb and hook it to your mother are you following me so the life that is conceived in your mother womb is only manufacturing you based on the blueprint are you following me so the life that is in the pregnancy open the usb file and sit down and he said no no no no there must be a dark dot between the eyes who makes the dark dot melanin come here you make sure how many millimeter it was two millimeter across the right line and they do it are you there so when you are formed there nothing is added are you there nothing is removed you are coming up exactly god goes to sleep are you there god does not sit there to make sure no it is loaded it's gonna go from a to z because when he started work he's gonna finish it do you understand so when they manufacture you it is going according to the finished product this finished product hallelujah is god's perfect will for you are you there you must appreciate this you follow me you must love this you must accept this yes radically and you must protect it by protection you must conserve it just the way you look are you following me because when god comes to you he's looking you at your picture god cannot look at brother benjamin and calling brother angelo because god knew you before the foundation of the world are you there that's why the gift of discernment never missed because it's a gift of infallibility because brother branham was entering into the database of god brother prophet has access to the mind of god that's why brother branham can enter and see you and come back and call your name even though he never met you are you following me my god job chapter 10 verse 8 and 9. that hand which hang on the hands of god that hand has done what and do what fashion me together round about job is saying that what i am today i am not a product of my father i am not a product of my mother because maybe your father wants you to look like him but god said you're going to look like your mother maybe your father wants you to look like him and god said you're gonna look like your uncle on your mother's side and when mama look he said this is like my brother it is not mommy or daddy it is god that fashioned you like that are you there there knows that you have michael jackson are we okay i'm laying a foundation for you forever forever my brother forever i wish all the young people were here today the nose that you have the way your nose looked like mama did not do it [Music] maggie jackson it is not mama god made your nose like that are you following me michael jackson when you change their mouth you are actually telling god that the blueprint he made is wrong you are actually insulting god you are telling god you made a mistake the human category you are under whether you are a black man i told you some of you will control will will catch the message whether you are white men whether you are an indian whether you are chinese whether you are mexican whether you are in panic it is god that shows that color you must be proud of your color you must appreciate your color you must appreciate your tone you must be proud to be a white man you must be proud to be a black man you must be proud to be a hispanic you must be proud to be an agent because it's not you that chose it it is god that chose you to be that way [Music] i told you i can preach a message if i preach it it will go all around but it's for this church by young people you understand what i'm saying don't change your tone because the picture god have for you is maybe a lighter complexion or a dark compression all you need to do is maintain it keep it clean keep it acceptable but don't change anything because you are going against what the creator said young people go back to this and go listen to it and some of your marriage problem will be answered i'm going to repeat it again some of your marriages problem some of your marriage choice darn hand have made me and what it was god that fashioned you it is god that made you short accepted it is god that made you tall accepted hallelujah yet does that destroy me remember beseech you that that has made me as the word it was god that was making you he had your picture and he's making you according to his own picture psalm 119 verse 73 the hands have done what made me those online sometimes you need to make the picture bigger if you put double screen they don't see it okay their hands have made me and did what fashioned me now you understand what it means everybody clear psalm 139 verse 13. for that has possessed marine that has covered me in water so the one that comes on your mother's wound and begin to do surgery it is not your mother mother only bury you and give food to you but whatever is being done there whatever they're changing and putting this and change this and putting this have nothing to do with mama verse 14 i will praise thee for i am water. i want you to read it when you go home okay i am water so what you are god was not making it playing games you follow me god was making it with respect do you follow me if you don't believe this open your own bible and read it from your bible hallelujah am fearfully and what so what you are is wonderful are you there you don't need for somebody to tell you you are wonderful if i please you or not i am wonderfully made are you with me a not touch your taste but in front of god i am wonderfully made young people never built a complex be proud of what you want are you there teach the people to accept you just like you are don't never talk to somebody putting your friend like this when you talk to them look at them in their eyes look at them in their eyes tell them i'm a human being and i'm proud of what male men yes thank you are you there i'm a white man i am proud to be a white man i'm a black man i am proud to be a black man i'm a hispanic i am proud to be a hispanic look at people in the eyes don't talk to people like this because your friend told you you are not beautiful why did you get married if you are not beautiful why did somebody can't sleep because of you it was it was beautiful according to them but let the man that god ordained for you come they can show him all kind of defect he's still going for you because you were wonderfully married hallelujah i will praise thee for i am water fearfully and water and water i water so when i'm looking at this church i see beautiful people wonderful people handsome people wonderfully amazed people are you there you are wonderfully made hallelujah you are marvelous when i see you i could call you my marvelous brother john my marvelous brother brother hamilton my motherless brother kalima because you are marvelous made you are wonderfully mad who are you to call a creature of god ugly who are you to call a sister ugly who are you you are actually calling god that he made a mistake you are insulting god because you want everybody to be like you there are boys that are giving to a dark tone you can show him all the fair sister nothing click the day you take a picture of a dark sister you put it there you say that's the one there is something in him that is built on me for black system you can walk you say i'm prettier than she i'm prettier and see i'm pretty how many times have you seen girls getting married and you say how did that boy marry that girl this is a boy everybody in a message thought that he's gonna have a a a a a a great caliber woman this is the girl everybody was expecting we're gonna see her husband we're gonna see and the day she presents your husband you put your head right my god how many times have you seen that why he didn't see the beautiful that you call beautiful hallelujah myself and my soul knows what your soul today must understand that verse 15 my substance was not hid from this when i was made in water in mama's womb and water so it's not a a a bad job when god was making you god was very careful the way he's making you so you are not a cheap product you don't come from china you come directly from manufacturing guarantee 100 original seal do not cheap and don't let nobody treat you cheaper church don't let nobody treat you cheap the purchase of the blood of jesus christ hallelujah my substance

manufactured when as yet there was work before you even existed in your mother's womb in this picture all your measurements were already recorded that's why noah could build a knock because the measurements were given to noah amen how precious also are those unto me oh god how great is the water so every program of your life is precious in the life of god everything that's why the bible says all things work together for what it's all precious everybody clear isaiah 53 verse 2 for he shall go out before me as a tender plant and as a root he started with his tummy ache he's already beaten there better now okay praise god so he has grown out before him as a tender plant as a root out of a dry ground he has no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no water that we should do what who was he talking about so when god programmed jesus god removed beautiful jesus do you follow me but the scripture says he is the fairest of what to what are you there the beauty of jesus is not a natural beauty naturally there is nothing attractive to him but spiritually he is the fairest what ten thousand doing so who are you to insult the face of jesus who made him luke chapter 19 verse 2 and behold there was a man named who which was a chief among the publicans and he was rich and he sought to see jesus to see jesus who he was and could not for the press because he was water did god did not come to zacchaeus because he was shortened who made zakiru's show matthew chapter 6 verse 27 which of you by taking what can i do what unto his word do you think you can change who you

uniqueness that you are a god of variety to be proud of what we are to appreciate what you have done for us and to appreciate the grace that you had for us to make us what we are father you insisted lord that our bodies are the temple of the holy spirit father how should we treat a temple of god when you came in your own temple and you found people in the temple selling bird selling lord animals and no doubt there were maybe material or faces going all around the floor of the temple because they turned the temple into a marketplace where the temple became dirty father you never spoke to them quietly lord you planted some rope your prophet told us and you enter into the temple whooping them to tell them that this is the house of prayer and the temple of the lord should not be tempering

wives how should we presenting ourselves to the public what else do we want to put on our body that we think was not made correctly by you what else do we want to amplify in our body that we think that you made an arrow what else do we want to add to have a surgery being done to change lord father to expose that we think lord father you made lord an error lord may this message soak deep into the heart of your children father may we appreciate what we are and may lord father we understand that we need to take care of the body father lord jesus christ and be looking like christian talking
