[27:11] [Music]
[27:16] this boy isn't praying
[27:19] dear god our heavenly father lord jesus
[27:22] christ
[27:23] the great creator of heaven and earth
[27:26] and everything that is therein
[27:28] lord we are gathered here not to see a
[27:31] man not to see each other
[27:33] but we have come here lord to see you
[27:36] to hear from you heavenly father lord
[27:39] may you help us
[27:40] come now and be with us because we don't
[27:43] want to go out of those doors
[27:45] the same way we came we want to go out
[27:47] different lord
[27:49] we may have different issues lord
[27:51] different problems
[27:52] but we pray that as the way to be coming
[27:54] forth all those things will be resolved
[27:57] lord jesus christ you are the god who
[27:59] said you never put us to shame
[28:01] because you promised in your word and
[28:03] the way it is true
[28:05] it says it in the book of joy that my
[28:07] people shall never be put to share
[28:08] and lord we are holding onto that
[28:10] promise you said whatsoever we have need
[28:12] of if we ask you lord
[28:14] you always answer you are the god who is
[28:16] more than willing to give unto us the
[28:18] desires of our hearts
[28:20] then we are willing to receive them
[28:22] father so lord we are holding on to that
[28:24] knowing
[28:25] heavenly father once you promise in your
[28:27] word there is nothing lord that can go
[28:30] wrong because father it is already said
[28:33] and it is settled up in the heavens
[28:35] above
[28:35] so lord we are holding on to that
[28:38] there's nothing else we can trust in
[28:40] everything else has failed us
[28:41] politics has failed us lord our jobs
[28:44] sometimes they failed us
[28:46] lord our family members they failed us
[28:48] but you are the only one
[28:50] the brother the friend that sticketh
[28:51] closer than a brother
[28:53] and we are trusting and depending on you
[28:54] to see us through
[28:56] lord there may be requests that have not
[28:58] been uttered by the word of mouth
[28:59] but we kindly ask you to meet each and
[29:02] every one
[29:03] according to what they have need of you
[29:05] know father
[29:06] everything that your children hear from
[29:08] the oldest to the youngest in this
[29:09] building
[29:10] where we all receive is according to our
[29:12] faith and to help us lord to believe to
[29:15] know that
[29:16] god is more than able no matter how the
[29:18] situation looks like
[29:20] you are more than able heavenly father
[29:22] because we have done it before we read
[29:24] in the bible you have done it lord for
[29:25] shadrach meshach and abednego
[29:27] they were thrown into that fairy
[29:29] fairness and lord you appeared just at
[29:31] the last minute
[29:32] when even people they thought well their
[29:34] goddess forsaken them
[29:36] but you appeared right on time you are
[29:38] never late heavenly father
[29:40] so we are praying lord there may be
[29:42] different situations it may be held
[29:44] it may be financial it may be family
[29:46] issues
[29:47] whatever it may be father the needs are
[29:49] so innumerable but you are the god
[29:52] who is the solution to all that because
[29:56] you said
[29:57] even the prophet teaches before there
[29:59] was a fin on the fish
[30:01] there had to be water for that fish to
[30:03] swim in
[30:04] before there was even a wings on a bed
[30:07] they have to be
[30:09] air for the bed to be able to fly so
[30:12] lord before there was needs
[30:13] there was the one who could fulfill
[30:15] those needs
[30:17] so we kindly ask you this morning to
[30:19] meet each and every one
[30:20] as we have come to hear from you bless
[30:23] the song leader lord as he continues to
[30:25] lead us in the songs of zion
[30:27] bless all those who shall come here and
[30:29] sing the specials anoint them in a
[30:31] special way
[30:32] and bless the preacher as they shall
[30:33] stand forth here may we not see a man
[30:36] but may we see you speaking to us using
[30:38] him as your mouth peace lord
[30:40] we pray now you bless the thoughts and
[30:42] offerings and everything that shall take
[30:44] place in this house may you be the one
[30:46] to get all the glory or the honor and
[30:48] all the praise
[30:49] at the end of it all we pray and ask all
[30:52] these things in the name of our lord
[30:53] and our savior jesus christ amen

[37:08] making more time for him and getting
[37:09] caught up in his presence
[37:11] and that's what this song is about this
[37:14] world
[37:15] this life god has given us like
[37:18] it's like we take it for granted
[37:20] sometimes and we get focused on the
[37:22] things he blessed us with that we forgot
[37:23] about the blesser himself and
[37:27] what's been on my heart is just making
[37:29] more time for god making more time for
[37:31] god
[37:31] making for it's high for god because
[37:33] it's a relationship it's a daily walk
[37:37] we might stumble we might fall but we
[37:39] have to get back up
[37:40] and ask god for strength and to fight
[37:43] for us because we can't do it by
[37:44] ourselves

[57:32] a few hands a few hands a few hands
[57:35] okay hopefully you're going to stay in
[57:38] tune
[57:38] i just want to remind you that at the
[57:40] end of the service
[57:42] this morning we're going to pick up the
[57:44] building fund
[57:46] offering so the trustees will be
[57:48] standing with a basket over there
[57:50] and as you're going up just remember to
[57:53] go ahead and drop something in
[57:54] to help us move on with our building
[57:57] amen
[57:58] and also continue to remember the
[58:00] building in prayer the work of the
[58:02] building in prayer
[58:03] amen there was someone who asked me a
[58:06] question and it was quite a good one
[58:09] but i could not answer it by replying by
[58:13] text so sometimes
[58:14] your questions are easier i can go ahead
[58:16] and send you an answer right away
[58:18] or a quote but some of them we got to
[58:20] sit down and talk amen
[58:22] so when i send you a message like we got
[58:24] to sit down and talk
[58:26] it's up to you to either talk to me or
[58:28] talk to the deacon so we can sit down
[58:29] and go through scripture
[58:31] i cannot write you a long text message
[58:34] like this
[58:35] until you have to read read read and you
[58:37] lose focus amen
[58:38] so you have questions let's sit down on
[58:41] some of them let's talk
[58:42] go through the message go through the
[58:44] scripture and make sure you get an
[58:46] adequate answer everybody clear so far
[58:49] amen blessed be the name of the lord
[58:51] we're going through a small breathing
[58:53] here
[58:54] because there was a change that was made
[58:56] and the church need to be aware of it
[58:58] amen
[58:59] the bible brother branham says here in
[59:02] the message question and answer
[59:04] he says we believe in church government
[59:07] i already read this quote to you but
[59:10] sometimes we got to refresh
[59:11] and we go back and make sure these
[59:13] things still soak in
[59:15] and we don't forget about it brother
[59:17] branham said we believe
[59:19] in church government for some reason
[59:21] this screen is not
[59:23] adequate here i don't know but you can
[59:25] work it out if you can see clear that's
[59:27] fine
[59:27] but it looks to be tilted amen
[59:30] we believe in church government and the
[59:33] government
[59:34] is order of the holy spirit in the bible
[59:38] so our government is not the government
[59:40] of the world
[59:41] that is ruled by politics but our
[59:44] government is completely
[59:46] ordered by the holy spirit brother
[59:48] branham said that the pastor is
[59:50] always not sometime he say it's
[59:54] always the head of the church
[59:57] the pastor is can you say amen always
[1:00:01] that is god's elder so when we're
[1:00:05] talking about an elder for a local
[1:00:07] church
[1:00:08] that elder is the pastor everybody clear
[1:00:11] he say in organization you have to come
[1:00:14] through the bishop
[1:00:15] in other words if you go to the world
[1:00:17] through the baptist the methodist
[1:00:19] the presbyterian you got to meet the
[1:00:21] bishop first
[1:00:22] before you go into the pastor that is
[1:00:25] not the way
[1:00:26] in the message in the message every
[1:00:29] church
[1:00:29] is sovereign
[1:00:33] don't worry you're gonna wake up amen
[1:00:36] the pastor is always the head of the
[1:00:39] church
[1:00:40] the pastor is always that is god's elder
[1:00:43] in
[1:00:43] organization looks better my brother you
[1:00:46] have to come through the bishop
[1:00:48] now the bible there is no higher order
[1:00:51] in the bible
[1:00:52] than the elder of the church
[1:00:55] just tell me where it is that there is
[1:00:57] no eye no higher order in the bible
[1:01:00] for the church than who the elder which
[1:01:02] is who
[1:01:04] the pastor that is the highest order
[1:01:07] of the bible in other words when he come
[1:01:10] to this church
[1:01:13] the only one that is above me
[1:01:17] is the lord jesus christ can i repeat it
[1:01:20] again
[1:01:21] the only one that is above us
[1:01:24] is the lord jesus christ and he is the
[1:01:28] revealed word
[1:01:29] of the hour amen if you see
[1:01:32] somewhere in the scripture where the
[1:01:35] bible says something
[1:01:37] or you go in the message and brother
[1:01:39] branham is referring into something
[1:01:42] whether it is a deacon or a trustee
[1:01:45] or even your pastor we all have to
[1:01:49] submit
[1:01:50] to the scripture or to that quote amen
[1:01:54] but if it is your preference that's a
[1:01:57] different story
[1:01:58] but if it is the word then even the
[1:02:02] pastor
[1:02:02] is subject to the word because paul
[1:02:06] says that the husband is the head of the
[1:02:09] wife
[1:02:10] but christ is the head of the husband
[1:02:14] amen so there is no bishop in this
[1:02:17] message
[1:02:18] that is above me everybody clear
[1:02:23] brother branham said the church it is
[1:02:25] sovereign in itself
[1:02:28] we have no word
[1:02:31] anybody clear no bishop where are you
[1:02:35] going
[1:02:35] we have no general office here we have
[1:02:39] who amen he is the water
[1:02:44] he is the general water overseer he
[1:02:48] is the water the head pastor of this
[1:02:52] church is the lord
[1:02:54] i am just a pastor under the head pastor
[1:03:01] everybody clear he is the king
[1:03:05] he is the lord he is the healer
[1:03:09] he is all and all we
[1:03:12] are just his subject working in there
[1:03:16] right everybody clear where does he say
[1:03:19] in the bible that he's the chief bishop
[1:03:22] in hebrew chapter 13 verse 20
[1:03:26] now the god of peace that brought again
[1:03:29] from the dead
[1:03:30] our who lord jesus that great water
[1:03:34] so your great shepherd is the lord jesus
[1:03:37] christ
[1:03:38] i am not your great shepherd i am a
[1:03:41] shepherd
[1:03:42] under the great shepherd everybody clear
[1:03:46] that great shepherd of the sheep through
[1:03:49] the blood of the everlasting covenant
[1:03:52] in first peter chapter 2 verse 25
[1:03:55] for we are ye a sheep
[1:03:58] going astray but i now return
[1:04:02] unto the water and the water
[1:04:06] the shepherd and the bishop of europe
[1:04:09] so the bishop of this church is the lord
[1:04:13] jesus christ amen
[1:04:17] in 1st peter chapter 5 verse 4 the bible
[1:04:20] says
[1:04:21] that and when the chief shepherd again
[1:04:24] is the great shepherd he's the shepherd
[1:04:27] he is the bishop he is the chief
[1:04:30] shepherd
[1:04:31] matter of fact david said the lord is my
[1:04:34] everybody clear jesus said i am
[1:04:38] the good shepherd ever clear
[1:04:41] so the great shepherd of this church is
[1:04:43] the lord jesus christ
[1:04:45] he said when the chief shepherd shall
[1:04:48] appear
[1:04:48] you shall receive a crown of glory that
[1:04:51] faded
[1:04:52] not away everybody clears so far brother
[1:04:55] branham say i believe
[1:04:56] in the supreme
[1:05:00] can you say amen can you see this
[1:05:03] clearly
[1:05:04] i believe in the supreme
[1:05:07] authority of the local
[1:05:10] assembly this church is a
[1:05:14] supreme authority there is no
[1:05:18] pastor that is offered this church
[1:05:21] there is no bishop that is above this
[1:05:24] church
[1:05:25] there is nobody we must give an account
[1:05:28] to
[1:05:29] in this church we give an account to the
[1:05:31] word
[1:05:32] and to the message of the hour everybody
[1:05:35] clear
[1:05:37] we can consult our brothers we can ask a
[1:05:40] question
[1:05:41] but this church is sovereign everybody
[1:05:45] clear
[1:05:45] i believe in the supreme authority of
[1:05:50] the local assembly
[1:05:51] yes let each church be its water
[1:05:56] so this church is not going to be
[1:05:58] exactly
[1:05:59] like another church in north carolina
[1:06:02] don't try to make this
[1:06:04] church and have a church in the message
[1:06:06] this church is
[1:06:07] sovereign hallelujah
[1:06:12] choose its own pastor each person
[1:06:16] choose its deacon whatever it
[1:06:19] is and then that way the man in there
[1:06:23] has no water
[1:06:27] the one who desired is the church as a
[1:06:30] whole
[1:06:31] not a bishop no bishop have a right to
[1:06:34] tell us what to do here
[1:06:36] it is the church that have the right to
[1:06:39] say what they want
[1:06:41] hallelujah the holy spirit
[1:06:44] wants to speak something to that church
[1:06:46] they don't have to ask
[1:06:48] anybody about whether they could do this
[1:06:51] or that
[1:06:53] so if you have a tendency to call people
[1:06:56] around and tell them what to do or ask a
[1:06:58] question
[1:07:00] just learn from today amen go in the
[1:07:03] bible
[1:07:04] go in the message and bring it to us
[1:07:07] amen
[1:07:08] they don't have to ask anybody about
[1:07:11] whether they could do this or do that
[1:07:14] it is the individual in contact with the
[1:07:17] holy spirit
[1:07:19] show me by the bible what is greater
[1:07:22] in the bible than the local water
[1:07:26] to a local that is right yes sir
[1:07:30] the sovereignty of the local church
[1:07:33] each church in water in itself
[1:07:37] now brotherhood that is wonderful
[1:07:40] all churches ought to be in brotherhood
[1:07:42] like that together
[1:07:44] so that's why we call ministers from
[1:07:46] other church that's why we call pastor
[1:07:48] from other church
[1:07:49] but no matter when we call them this
[1:07:52] church is
[1:07:53] sovereign anybody clear but
[1:07:56] the sovereignty of the local what ever
[1:08:00] created so far
[1:08:01] blessed be the name of the lord brother
[1:08:04] branham said
[1:08:04] look the way we used to do it years ago
[1:08:08] sister gertie was the pianist
[1:08:11] when our pastor here who was the pastor
[1:08:16] so brother branham used to be a pastor
[1:08:20] give me grace we're going to get to the
[1:08:22] message brother branham was a pastor
[1:08:24] he said when i passed her here i had to
[1:08:28] be
[1:08:28] pastor and water
[1:08:32] can you say amen and what
[1:08:36] everything else at once
[1:08:39] but i had to do it
[1:08:43] everybody i had to do it everybody clear
[1:08:47] so a pastor can be a pastor himself
[1:08:54] amen a pastor
[1:08:57] can also act as a deacon
[1:09:01] can you say amen a pastor can be a
[1:09:05] trustee
[1:09:08] can you say amen a pastor can be a
[1:09:12] secretary treasurer
[1:09:20] can you say amen okay
[1:09:24] let's read this in damn days
[1:09:29] we who is we wife and who
[1:09:34] who's i what about them
[1:09:37] we wife and i had to go down
[1:09:41] have a head to go do on water
[1:09:48] can you say amen so a pastor can be a
[1:09:52] secretary treasurer
[1:09:56] in them days we wife and i
[1:10:00] had to go do on secretary work
[1:10:03] and we live in two little rooms and we
[1:10:06] go down to the post office
[1:10:09] so a secretary treasurer is responsible
[1:10:12] for the mail
[1:10:19] and take one of these wash baskets
[1:10:22] every morning get it full of what
[1:10:26] that's the whole job of a secretary
[1:10:28] treasurer anybody clear
[1:10:31] did jesus do something like that
[1:10:35] jesus was a good nature too
[1:10:38] but when he come to saving time to say
[1:10:40] things
[1:10:41] it is written my father's house is made
[1:10:44] the house of prayer
[1:10:46] and you are making it a den of what
[1:10:48] thieves
[1:10:49] he knowed when to speak
[1:10:52] and when not to speak everybody clear
[1:10:55] that is what we got to do
[1:11:01] don't worry devil you're going to get
[1:11:03] blasted soon
[1:11:04] there was not never was a person
[1:11:07] like jesus he was who
[1:11:11] and remember he even talked about being
[1:11:15] a what
[1:11:16] so jesus also as a pastor
[1:11:20] was a deacon
[1:11:26] in the church he took over he planted
[1:11:30] some ropes together
[1:11:32] and he didn't wait to gently walk them
[1:11:38] out
[1:11:42] he beat them out that is your savior
[1:11:48] that is your chief shepherd he whooped
[1:11:52] people in the church
[1:11:57] we're not going to whoop you anybody
[1:12:00] here
[1:12:01] he beat them out as the house of god
[1:12:06] he was playing the part of water
[1:12:10] anybody clear for an example to you
[1:12:13] deacon see he was your example
[1:12:17] and now it is written my father's house
[1:12:20] has made a house of prayer
[1:12:22] now remember jesus was a what
[1:12:25] a deacon then you know what jesus was
[1:12:28] taking the part of her
[1:12:30] deacon everybody clear brother branham
[1:12:33] continue
[1:12:34] when he come the part of a pastor
[1:12:38] so jesus was also a pastor
[1:12:45] what did he say you blind pharisee
[1:12:48] leaders of the blind he was taking the
[1:12:51] part of her
[1:12:53] a pastor then and when
[1:12:56] he taught them what was going to happen
[1:12:59] he taken the part of oh a prophet he was
[1:13:03] foretelling the future see
[1:13:05] and when they require that they must be
[1:13:08] tribute paid he taken the pot of water
[1:13:16] check everybody clear
[1:13:19] peter go down and cast the hook into the
[1:13:22] river
[1:13:23] and the first fish you take up has got a
[1:13:26] coin
[1:13:26] in his mouth pay them see pay your just
[1:13:30] debt
[1:13:31] say to us give caesar what is caesar
[1:13:34] god's word is god everybody clear so far
[1:13:37] brother branham continued he was both
[1:13:40] what
[1:13:42] prophet trustee and deacon
[1:13:45] sure was he so
[1:13:48] then you see what he did he let
[1:13:51] that be your example in the house here
[1:13:54] at this branham
[1:13:55] tabernacle that we want to be a house
[1:13:59] that shall be honored in everything
[1:14:02] and honoring with everything every
[1:14:05] office
[1:14:06] every place that there'll be no taking
[1:14:08] back
[1:14:09] there be gentleness and sweetness and
[1:14:12] kindness
[1:14:13] but just straight on the line every
[1:14:16] man's
[1:14:16] at his post of duty see that is the way
[1:14:20] that is the way he wants it he never
[1:14:22] slag
[1:14:24] when it comes time to say call what was
[1:14:27] called what was what he called it in
[1:14:30] other words when it was time to say
[1:14:32] jesus have to say what you want to say
[1:14:34] everybody clear
[1:14:35] when it comes time to show gentleness
[1:14:38] then he showed
[1:14:39] gentleness he was sweet kind
[1:14:42] understanding but what stern
[1:14:45] and everything was right to the dot with
[1:14:48] him
[1:14:48] and he did that for your example
[1:14:52] now the holy spirit just gave me that
[1:14:57] what i just explained you here the holy
[1:14:59] spirit gave it to brother branham
[1:15:02] so i never thought about that him being
[1:15:05] what
[1:15:06] before but he was america
[1:15:11] praise the name of the lord but abraham
[1:15:13] continues here
[1:15:15] he says now you don't have to do it that
[1:15:19] way
[1:15:21] because you got men to carry this out
[1:15:24] in other words when a church started
[1:15:27] and there is not a lot of people the
[1:15:30] pastor
[1:15:31] as an overseer as the elder of the
[1:15:34] church
[1:15:34] can act temporarily as
[1:15:38] a pastor as a deacon
[1:15:41] as a trustee as a secretary in other
[1:15:44] words the pastor can fulfill
[1:15:46] every office just like jesus did it
[1:15:50] but when you get people in the church to
[1:15:53] do it
[1:15:54] then you don't have to do it that way
[1:15:56] everybody clear
[1:15:58] now you don't have to do it that way
[1:16:01] because you got men to carry this out
[1:16:04] i had usher brought a seaward and all of
[1:16:06] them at the door
[1:16:08] they had booked pile around there at the
[1:16:11] door
[1:16:11] setting in a chair or something another
[1:16:14] and when someone come in
[1:16:16] you show them a place to hang your coat
[1:16:19] and help them to their
[1:16:20] seat you give them a water
[1:16:24] on here we don't have songs books
[1:16:27] technology is improving but the word of
[1:16:30] god
[1:16:31] remains the same amen even though things
[1:16:35] begin to go on a computer
[1:16:37] the word or this concept of god does not
[1:16:40] change
[1:16:41] amen if we don't give people songbook
[1:16:45] we gotta make sure our projector is
[1:16:47] working
[1:16:48] amen because your song book become
[1:16:51] electronic
[1:16:53] under projector ever clear
[1:16:56] to help you up let me say this
[1:16:59] many times teenager children and
[1:17:02] sometime
[1:17:03] adult you know young people
[1:17:06] will pass what in the old time we used
[1:17:10] to have notes
[1:17:11] you come in church you have a little
[1:17:13] piece of paper and a pen
[1:17:15] you're going to write something and
[1:17:16] maybe your friend is sitting beside you
[1:17:18] and you write a note you say how are you
[1:17:20] doing and you give it to him
[1:17:22] everybody clear today we don't do that
[1:17:25] amen our paper become electronics
[1:17:30] can you say amen our ink our pen
[1:17:34] is what you text albert here
[1:17:38] the passing or not is still valid
[1:17:42] but as of today don't text in the church
[1:17:50] everybody here do not text in the church
[1:17:55] you want to text go outside
[1:18:01] only those that are working on the sound
[1:18:04] or those that are looking online
[1:18:05] they have a legitimate reason to do it
[1:18:08] amen
[1:18:09] because nobody could profane the sabbath
[1:18:12] but the priest who was inside the
[1:18:14] sanctuary could profane the sabbath
[1:18:17] and he was not a sin unto him look in
[1:18:20] your scripture
[1:18:22] when the corner jesus jesus said your
[1:18:24] priest over there
[1:18:26] is working on the sabbath day and he was
[1:18:28] not seen
[1:18:29] because he is under a different headship
[1:18:32] everybody
[1:18:33] young people will pass note or cut up or
[1:18:37] something in church
[1:18:38] now you are old enough to know better
[1:18:40] than that you should know better than
[1:18:42] that we want to leave this habit
[1:18:44] right here before we go to the church if
[1:18:47] you expect to be a real man someday
[1:18:50] and raise a family to the kingdom of god
[1:18:52] then start off in the beginning
[1:18:55] you see and act right and do right
[1:18:59] if someone young people usually you want
[1:19:03] to sit together
[1:19:04] i don't have any problem with it young
[1:19:06] man you want to sit together
[1:19:08] i don't have any problem with that but
[1:19:10] make sure
[1:19:11] the one sitting beside you is not there
[1:19:14] to bring a distraction to you you didn't
[1:19:17] leave your home
[1:19:18] to come here for someone to hinder your
[1:19:21] blessing
[1:19:23] amen you cannot be in church talking to
[1:19:26] your friend
[1:19:28] you cannot be in church passing note
[1:19:31] you cannot be in church texting
[1:19:35] this is the church of the living god
[1:19:37] everybody clear
[1:19:40] in the message god hiding himself in
[1:19:42] simplicity
[1:19:44] brother branham said now this may seem a
[1:19:47] little rude
[1:19:48] but it is not a place to visit
[1:19:52] it's a place to do what you want to talk
[1:19:55] you go outside
[1:19:56] amen if you're putting the instrument
[1:19:59] here
[1:20:00] make sure whatever you talk concern the
[1:20:03] instrument
[1:20:04] you don't put the instrument here and
[1:20:07] begin to talk about your weak
[1:20:09] you need to go outside
[1:20:13] we should never even what
[1:20:17] not talking even what you do
[1:20:23] we should never even murmur a word
[1:20:27] inside of here outside of what
[1:20:32] to one another unless it is absolutely
[1:20:35] water
[1:20:36] can you please change the baby's diaper
[1:20:39] that makes sense
[1:20:41] but not just cut up
[1:20:45] amen we should never
[1:20:48] rally around we should never run through
[1:20:52] the building
[1:20:53] and let our children run through the
[1:20:56] water
[1:20:57] even after church mama pick up your kids
[1:21:01] let's go outside if you don't change the
[1:21:05] habit here you're going to bring it in
[1:21:06] the church over there
[1:21:08] so we make sure we clean up everything
[1:21:10] here
[1:21:11] not texting not talking except
[1:21:14] it's absolutely necessary
[1:21:18] respect yourself and we're going to
[1:21:20] respect you
[1:21:22] if you don't listen i'm going to talk to
[1:21:23] you
[1:21:25] warning then judgment america
[1:21:29] praise be the name of the lord he said
[1:21:32] give them a song book
[1:21:34] and ask them to be in water no talking
[1:21:38] and then everybody set in their seat and
[1:21:41] silently pray
[1:21:42] until starting time when you get here
[1:21:45] get on your seat start praying stop
[1:21:48] talking
[1:21:51] there is a time to talk and there is a
[1:21:54] time to be quiet
[1:21:56] if your friend talk a lot stay
[1:22:00] find another seat
[1:22:03] if your child is crying you cannot let
[1:22:06] your child cry for five minutes
[1:22:08] before you move on
[1:22:12] the child is crying crying crying just
[1:22:14] pick up your child go outside
[1:22:17] but you want to stay there seven minutes
[1:22:19] until a deacon have to talk to you
[1:22:22] respect one another everybody clear
[1:22:26] now going back to this brother branham
[1:22:28] say you don't have to do it that way
[1:22:31] because you got men to carry this out
[1:22:35] so when we start in july i believe
[1:22:40] when i got elected here we have men in
[1:22:42] this church
[1:22:44] that can do the work amen that's the
[1:22:46] reason why we appointed
[1:22:48] trustees we appointed usher
[1:22:51] to go ahead and start doing the work
[1:22:54] until we move on everybody clear
[1:22:57] i never thought i needed to add a sunday
[1:23:00] school
[1:23:01] superintendent because number one we
[1:23:03] don't have a sunday school here
[1:23:05] and we don't have room for it but if we
[1:23:08] go back to the building
[1:23:09] and the kids start sunday school we're
[1:23:12] gonna appoint one
[1:23:13] anybody clear until we wait and then we
[1:23:16] voted on it
[1:23:17] everybody clear i did not think we need
[1:23:20] a secretary treasurer i thought the
[1:23:23] trustee can go ahead and handle
[1:23:25] everything
[1:23:26] everybody clear that's the reason why we
[1:23:28] went through
[1:23:29] and all the way to this year we did the
[1:23:32] voting and everything was over
[1:23:34] but after the voting i got the report
[1:23:37] from the trustees
[1:23:38] and some of them you know some of you
[1:23:41] were contacted
[1:23:42] we had to make some correction everybody
[1:23:46] i thought we can go a whole year
[1:23:49] without adding a secretary treasurer
[1:23:52] but when i look at the report i
[1:23:55] understood
[1:23:56] that it was time to add a secretary
[1:24:00] treasurer
[1:24:01] because the trustees need some help
[1:24:03] everybody clear
[1:24:05] so at the beginning your trustees were
[1:24:08] doing
[1:24:08] two jobs they were working as a trustees
[1:24:13] and they also were working as your
[1:24:16] secretary
[1:24:17] treasurer everybody cleared so far why
[1:24:20] did you give the trustees the job of a
[1:24:23] secretary treasurer
[1:24:25] brother branham in church order the
[1:24:28] trustee
[1:24:30] only thing they are under duty
[1:24:33] by god to watch over water
[1:24:36] the trustees watch over finance
[1:24:43] can you say amen i go like this because
[1:24:47] some some of the stuff we thought people
[1:24:49] knew it
[1:24:50] but we found out we need to be taught as
[1:24:53] a pastor i gotta lay it out
[1:24:55] everybody clear the trusty only thing
[1:24:58] they are under duty by gods
[1:25:00] to watch that finance and take care of
[1:25:03] that
[1:25:04] the things that goes on like that i told
[1:25:07] you about them tips
[1:25:08] which is a property of the church and
[1:25:10] about other things here that goes on
[1:25:13] about the building and the water
[1:25:16] so when it comes to the building and the
[1:25:18] repair
[1:25:20] you need to talk to her
[1:25:24] everybody clear and taking up their
[1:25:27] finances who pick up the offering
[1:25:37] everybody clear so now you begin to
[1:25:39] understand
[1:25:41] some of them everybody clear they're
[1:25:43] building repair and taking
[1:25:45] and taking up the finance and things
[1:25:48] that is what the trust is off
[1:25:51] the property they're the finances and
[1:25:55] what
[1:25:56] in church order paragraph 113 now there
[1:25:59] has been complaint all along
[1:26:01] on making the tips now when there is a
[1:26:05] complaint
[1:26:06] on anything pertaining to what
[1:26:10] finances of this church it is duty-bound
[1:26:14] to who
[1:26:16] to see that thing is what if you have a
[1:26:19] problem with the finances you need to
[1:26:21] see who
[1:26:23] everybody clear so far that is the order
[1:26:26] of the church
[1:26:29] brother branham in the placing of deacon
[1:26:32] does
[1:26:32] this congregation feel that brother hand
[1:26:37] is a just and a righteous man
[1:26:40] who has been with us for water
[1:26:43] so before you join
[1:26:46] an office in the church
[1:26:50] clear are you awake you must be with us
[1:26:54] for some time
[1:26:57] ever here you cannot come here in two
[1:27:00] weeks and you are you expecting to get a
[1:27:03] job
[1:27:07] hallelujah a just and a righteous man
[1:27:11] who has been with us for some time to be
[1:27:14] the the water
[1:27:19] there is the word secretary and the word
[1:27:22] treasurer combined together the
[1:27:25] secretary treasurer of this church
[1:27:27] to hand there each water
[1:27:33] so the secretary treasurer
[1:27:39] also handle what
[1:27:42] the trust is under water so there is an
[1:27:46] intersection between the trustees and
[1:27:49] the secretary
[1:27:53] everybody here to handle its finances
[1:27:57] and to pay its water
[1:28:00] so the secretary is responsible for
[1:28:03] paying the bills
[1:28:08] he is also responsible for the mail
[1:28:12] everybody clear we want you to stay
[1:28:15] on the word if
[1:28:18] brother stephen the trustees
[1:28:21] handed the finances the secretary
[1:28:24] handed the finances now you have
[1:28:26] appointed a secretary treasurer
[1:28:29] how can you split them
[1:28:34] are you ready in second king chapter 12
[1:28:38] verse 9 and 12
[1:28:40] you who are looking online it is for
[1:28:42] this church

[1:28:56] set it beside the altar on the right
[1:28:58] side as one cometh
[1:29:00] into the house of the lord and the
[1:29:02] priest that kept
[1:29:03] the door put therein all the money that
[1:29:06] was brought into the house of the lord
[1:29:09] and he was so when they saw that there
[1:29:12] was much money
[1:29:13] in the chest that the king water
[1:29:17] and the high priest came up and pulled
[1:29:20] up

[1:29:23] words
[1:29:24] there was a report that was given
[1:29:27] that was found in the house of god
[1:29:30] before going further there was a scribe
[1:29:33] from the king and a scribe is what you
[1:29:37] call
[1:29:38] a secretary everybody clear let's go to
[1:29:41] john chapter 12.

[1:29:51] speak
[1:29:52] question will begin to pop up left and
[1:29:54] right left and right
[1:29:55] so let's answer those questions amen
[1:29:59] then he clears everything let's go to
[1:30:02] john chapter 12.
[1:30:03] if you dare you can say amen so give me
[1:30:06] grace this is important for the church
[1:30:14] i spoke to the trustee i had couple
[1:30:16] brothers in my mind
[1:30:18] one of them because of coffee is more
[1:30:21] not more
[1:30:22] available in the church but he's there
[1:30:25] and i presented to them a second one who
[1:30:28] i thought
[1:30:29] can do the work and help us up i
[1:30:31] appointed it i didn't voted
[1:30:34] you need to vote for it next year
[1:30:37] whether you agree or not
[1:30:39] then we find somebody else if you don't
[1:30:41] agree everybody clear
[1:30:43] let's go to john chapter 12. if you're
[1:30:45] there you can say
[1:30:47] chapter 4 then say one of his disciples
[1:30:52] not two
[1:30:56] how many disciples
[1:31:04] one disciple then say one of his
[1:31:07] disciples
[1:31:08] judas iscariot someone son
[1:31:12] which should betray him why was not this
[1:31:16] ointment
[1:31:17] sold for 300 pests and given to water
[1:31:22] so somebody among the disciple
[1:31:26] is worrying about the money to give it
[1:31:29] to the poor
[1:31:33] money to give to the poor
[1:31:38] why didn't peter worry about the money
[1:31:42] why didn't john worry about the money
[1:31:45] only judas let's continue
[1:31:50] verse six this he said
[1:31:53] not that he cared for the poor anybody
[1:31:56] clear
[1:31:57] but because he was a word
[1:32:00] and heard the word so the
[1:32:03] one that was holding the bag
[1:32:07] was judas there was only
[1:32:10] one disciple jesus had
[1:32:14] 70 he had 12 but
[1:32:17] out of all the number only one
[1:32:21] was responsible for the beggar
[1:32:24] or for the bank account
[1:32:30] because in that time they were keeping
[1:32:32] the church money
[1:32:33] in the bag and there was only one
[1:32:36] disciple
[1:32:37] that was responsible to the account
[1:32:43] hallelujah and paul what was put darwin
[1:32:48] ever clear let's go to chapter 13.
[1:32:54] john chapter 13. if you dare you can say
[1:32:56] amen
[1:32:58] hallelujah
[1:33:04] john chapter 13 verse 26 are you there
[1:33:09] and jesus answered here it is
[1:33:12] to whom i gave i shall give a soap or a
[1:33:16] morsel
[1:33:17] when i have dip it and when he had
[1:33:20] dipped the soap
[1:33:21] all the morsel he gave it to who
[1:33:25] judas is carried the son of who
[1:33:29] he gave it to the one that is
[1:33:31] responsible
[1:33:32] for the bank account of the church
[1:33:36] everybody clear verse 26
[1:33:40] and after verse 27 and after the soap
[1:33:44] sat and entered into him then said
[1:33:48] jesus to him that in other words what
[1:33:52] that you do do quickly
[1:33:56] verse 28 now no man at the table knew
[1:33:59] for what intent he spoke this to him
[1:34:03] for some of them thought because judah
[1:34:07] had the word
[1:34:08] because judah was the one that had the
[1:34:11] bank account of the church
[1:34:13] can you say amen judah had the beg
[1:34:17] that jesus had said to him by
[1:34:21] those things that we need against the
[1:34:23] world
[1:34:25] a secretary treasurer is somebody that
[1:34:28] can buy
[1:34:29] stuff for the lord's supper
[1:34:37] everybody clear
[1:34:41] the bible says brother branham says
[1:34:43] everybody clear
[1:34:45] they thought jesus had said
[1:34:49] by those things that we have need of
[1:34:52] against the feast
[1:34:53] or that he should give something to who
[1:34:57] so a secretary treasurer is somebody
[1:35:01] who's responsible for getting the money
[1:35:03] out
[1:35:05] from the account when you bring the
[1:35:08] money
[1:35:08] you give it to the secretary treasurer
[1:35:11] and he put it in the bag
[1:35:13] you just give him instruction to
[1:35:16] how to pull money out the secretary
[1:35:20] treasurer
[1:35:21] doesn't tell you what to do with the
[1:35:23] money
[1:35:24] he's only responsible to only
[1:35:28] give out or put the money into the
[1:35:31] account
[1:35:32] the one that give instruction about the
[1:35:35] money
[1:35:35] is the trustees
[1:35:40] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:35:43] lord
[1:35:45] and look at the church jesus the what
[1:35:49] judas the what that's why
[1:35:53] you have secretary treasurer
[1:35:58] as a secretary it's a scrub
[1:36:03] he's a man that must give you a record
[1:36:09] he's a man that must do your bookkeeping
[1:36:15] he's a man that must give you the report
[1:36:18] of the bank account
[1:36:20] that belonged to the church
[1:36:23] and there were not two of them only one
[1:36:27] anybody clear you can have five fifty
[1:36:30] trustees
[1:36:31] fifty deacon only or one disciple
[1:36:36] jesus the pastor judas the world
[1:36:40] both of them were what out of the same
[1:36:44] so secretary treasurer can be anybody
[1:36:48] he can be your brother it can be your
[1:36:51] uncle
[1:36:52] it can be your friend it can be any
[1:36:55] brother in the church there is no
[1:36:57] restriction
[1:36:59] can you say amen
[1:37:02] [Laughter]
[1:37:04] hallelujah in the message is this
[1:37:08] the son of the end time sir let me say
[1:37:11] that because i'm going west it is not
[1:37:15] that i'm leaving this tabernacle

[1:37:32] will remain my water can you say amen
[1:37:37] brother cox was also a secretary
[1:37:40] but he was not brother branham's family
[1:37:43] a secretary can be
[1:37:44] anybody in the church
[1:37:48] everybody clear so far what is the
[1:37:51] secretary
[1:37:52] job in the message from that time
[1:37:56] where am i at hallelujah wow

[1:38:02] field
[1:38:03] i do not receive it myself it's taken by

[1:38:43] meeting my water

[1:38:49] and what ever here
[1:38:55] hallelujah i think that as our own
[1:38:58] as our own people we should take care of
[1:39:01] them
[1:39:03] and it should be turning any complaint
[1:39:05] to the chairman
[1:39:06] of the deacon board in other words the
[1:39:08] head deacon and then
[1:39:10] it should be met by the deacon board to
[1:39:13] see what they are able
[1:39:14] to do about it in other words if you're
[1:39:16] going through headache
[1:39:18] through trouble you got fire at your job
[1:39:21] and something is not going right into
[1:39:24] your home
[1:39:25] you can talk to the deacon and the
[1:39:27] deacon will meet together
[1:39:28] and see what they can do about it
[1:39:30] everybody clear
[1:39:32] and all of those things which is
[1:39:34] clothing
[1:39:35] food and financial work for the people
[1:39:39] of the church
[1:39:41] or whatever it is should come through
[1:39:43] what
[1:39:44] if you have a problem in this church see
[1:39:47] the deacon
[1:39:50] then the deacon when they decide
[1:39:54] that they are what they are going to do
[1:39:55] about it then they should
[1:39:57] preserve be presented then to the what
[1:40:01] the deacon the treasurer doesn't tell
[1:40:04] the deacon what to do
[1:40:09] the treasure only take the request from
[1:40:12] the deacon
[1:40:17] hallelujah you see how we need to teach
[1:40:20] this thing
[1:40:21] if i get under this it's gonna take a
[1:40:23] siri
[1:40:24] amen then it should be presented to the
[1:40:28] treasure
[1:40:29] to see if the water the treasure
[1:40:32] is able at this time to pay
[1:40:36] this certain amount of water why
[1:40:39] the deacon don't know what it is in the
[1:40:42] bank account because it's held by how
[1:40:44] many people
[1:40:45] he is the one that can look in the bank
[1:40:48] and say
[1:40:48] i can pay your bill or not
[1:40:55] buy this clothing or whatever it is to
[1:40:59] that
[1:40:59] but the deacon board should meet on that
[1:41:02] it doesn't go through the world or to
[1:41:06] the world
[1:41:07] you can you say amen you get a problem
[1:41:10] you go see who

[1:41:16] exchange your bill

[1:41:21] your gas bill
[1:41:23] and they give the deacon a check that is
[1:41:26] equivalent or at the same level
[1:41:29] of your bill because he must keep
[1:41:34] record for accountability
[1:41:39] everybody clear it doesn't go through
[1:41:42] the trustees
[1:41:44] or to the it is the conflict oh
[1:41:48] praise be the name of the lord and then
[1:41:51] if
[1:41:51] he sees that the sanders could need the
[1:41:54] sunday school superintendent
[1:41:56] certain things then he is to present to
[1:41:59] who
[1:42:01] the sunday school is superintendent
[1:42:04] when he needs the bible or something for
[1:42:07] the kids
[1:42:08] he goes to the trustees
[1:42:13] this is how we operate
[1:42:16] and the trustees had a meeting upon it
[1:42:20] first then the trustees
[1:42:23] if they found that there is sufficient
[1:42:26] fund how do they find it and forth
[1:42:30] through the world even the trustees
[1:42:33] don't know what is in here
[1:42:38] can you say amen
[1:42:46] a trust if they found that there is
[1:42:48] sufficient fun
[1:42:49] and so forth through the treasure then
[1:42:52] this can be
[1:42:53] purchased if he wants something another
[1:42:56] for literature
[1:42:57] whatever it is some bible or something
[1:43:00] they want to buy some bible for one you
[1:43:02] know
[1:43:02] that can find the most word and quote
[1:43:04] the most scripture
[1:43:05] these are sister rails you know you had
[1:43:08] sunday school before you know how it
[1:43:10] goes
[1:43:10] some prizes something they are going to
[1:43:13] give away like that
[1:43:14] present they want to buy it through the
[1:43:16] church then let them present it to who
[1:43:20] to who the deacons if you go back there
[1:43:24] he said the trustees
[1:43:26] if you study down you're going to see
[1:43:27] it's the trustees then let them find out
[1:43:30] if it is in there
[1:43:32] ever clear so far their trust is they
[1:43:35] have
[1:43:36] nothing to do with it only repair the
[1:43:39] church
[1:43:40] and they can do it until there is the
[1:43:42] whole trusty boat not one trustee
[1:43:45] meet and say we shall build this or we
[1:43:48] shall do
[1:43:49] that then they have to ask who
[1:43:53] why do they ask him he's the one
[1:43:57] that look in the bank account everybody
[1:43:59] here
[1:44:00] they have to ask the treasurer if they
[1:44:03] got money to what
[1:44:05] the treasurer doesn't come up with any
[1:44:08] project
[1:44:12] can i repeat it again a secretary
[1:44:15] treasurer
[1:44:16] doesn't come with the project project
[1:44:19] comes from
[1:44:20] the pastor from the deacon board and
[1:44:22] from the trustee board
[1:44:24] he's there to execute you give him the
[1:44:28] receipt
[1:44:29] he gives you the money you give him the
[1:44:31] receipt he gives you the money
[1:44:32] if there is no money he says there is no
[1:44:34] money then you go back to the pastor
[1:44:38] i have a quote for that everybody here
[1:44:41] we're going to get into the world but if
[1:44:44] the treasury is low at that time
[1:44:46] and they can't afford it to do it in
[1:44:48] other words your secretary say
[1:44:50] i don't have money then he has to be
[1:44:52] taken up
[1:44:54] let me talk with the board giving order
[1:44:57] to who
[1:44:58] the trustees come back and say pastor we
[1:45:01] need to buy a microphone
[1:45:06] we got to find the solution amen
[1:45:09] then if there is no money then the
[1:45:12] pastor will tell you peter
[1:45:16] your fish man and go fishing
[1:45:20] open the mouth of the fish get the money
[1:45:24] and go do what you got to do brother
[1:45:26] branham say the reason why jesus did
[1:45:28] that
[1:45:29] because they were broke
[1:45:32] you need a coat you see me and then
[1:45:37] now tonight brother jones a horrible
[1:45:40] accident his house burned tonight
[1:45:42] as christian we are together and each
[1:45:44] one of us must make a pledge
[1:45:47] so what we can do to help brother jones
[1:45:50] back
[1:45:50] uh with his house whatever it is we
[1:45:53] shall do that
[1:45:54] let it be said from the water this is
[1:45:57] the order
[1:45:58] the trustees gave to the pastor anybody
[1:46:01] clear
[1:46:02] that is the way to do that and let the
[1:46:05] pledge
[1:46:06] be given in and then give it over to who
[1:46:10] the treasurer handled the pledges
[1:46:14] of the church

[1:46:20] anybody clear
[1:46:22] the pledges be given to the treasurer of
[1:46:25] the church and these pledges be paid
[1:46:27] through who

[1:46:47] that's why we give you a receipt at the
[1:46:50] end of the year
[1:46:51] it should be handled by the secretary
[1:46:54] treasurer anybody tax redemption or not

[1:47:01] those who are wondering why we give you
[1:47:03] receipt you got a quote for it you need

[2:01:50] redemption
[2:01:51] god is coming to claim you i spread must
[2:01:54] cut over you
[2:01:55] and cover that nakedness yeah
[2:01:59] i saw to you and enter into a water
[2:02:03] this woman is not married to anybody yet
[2:02:06] but she's trying to enter into a
[2:02:08] covenant with his maker
[2:02:10] with her maker first before your natural
[2:02:13] marriage you need to be married with who
[2:02:16] amen enter into a covenant with you say
[2:02:19] the lord
[2:02:20] and you become what and then god will
[2:02:23] put a mark in your life like
[2:02:25] jacob and that mark you will never
[2:02:28] forget it
[2:02:28] because you need the mark for your life
[2:02:30] journey verse
[2:02:32] 9 then what are you with what
[2:02:35] and i totally wash away your water
[2:02:39] so this woman when she was born she was
[2:02:42] polluted
[2:02:43] under her own blood but we know
[2:02:47] by the message and the teaching that the
[2:02:49] blood
[2:02:50] comes from the father everybody clear
[2:02:53] and the blood that you are born with
[2:02:55] is a natural blood which is coming from
[2:02:58] sex ever clear
[2:03:00] now when you look at the blood the bible
[2:03:03] says here
[2:03:04] in genesis chapter 9 that the flesh
[2:03:09] with the life thereof which is the water
[2:03:12] so when we talk about the blood we are
[2:03:15] really talking about the life
[2:03:18] that is in the blood when you are born
[2:03:21] you are living because there is a
[2:03:23] natural life that came into you through
[2:03:26] the blood everybody clear
[2:03:28] but that life is your natural life
[2:03:31] of sin it is a life that needs to be
[2:03:34] cleaned up
[2:03:35] it is a life that needs to be changed
[2:03:39] hallelujah he said the blood
[2:03:42] which is the blood thereof shall he not
[2:03:44] eat
[2:03:45] leviticus 17 verse 11 for the life of
[2:03:49] the flesh is in the water
[2:03:52] can you pray can you uh preach with me
[2:03:55] the life of the place is in water
[2:03:58] in the blood leviticus 17 verse 14
[2:04:02] for it is the life of all flesh the
[2:04:05] blood of it
[2:04:06] is for the life thereof therefore i
[2:04:09] said unto the children of israel you
[2:04:12] shall eat the blood of
[2:04:13] normandy of flesh for the life of the
[2:04:17] flesh
[2:04:17] is in the water it's in the blood amen
[2:04:21] this young lady when she was born she
[2:04:24] was born with
[2:04:25] a natural life and this natural life
[2:04:28] is a life of sin and it's a life that is
[2:04:31] shaped in iniquity
[2:04:33] so when the lord comes in your time of
[2:04:36] life
[2:04:37] he need to kill he need to clean up the
[2:04:40] first life
[2:04:41] in other words when you are born
[2:04:43] remember you are black on the outside
[2:04:45] black on the inside when god comes you
[2:04:48] need to remove the first
[2:04:50] blackness on the inside which is the
[2:04:52] life from your father
[2:04:54] and your mother everybody here so far
[2:04:57] praise be the name of the lord that's
[2:04:59] why we found roof
[2:05:01] they gave her with an instruction they
[2:05:04] say when you go
[2:05:05] you go to a place where boaz does what
[2:05:08] sleepeth and sleepeth in the bible spoke
[2:05:11] of what
[2:05:12] and the death of christ happened way
[2:05:16] at calvary at the cross and they told
[2:05:18] her to lay at her
[2:05:20] at his feet and brother branham when we
[2:05:23] were this brother branham explained that
[2:05:25] going to the feet means to be unworthy
[2:05:29] in the message go away jesus brother
[2:05:32] branham say
[2:05:33] i want to ask you that come to the altar
[2:05:36] just now
[2:05:37] from the bottom of your heart with you
[2:05:40] come
[2:05:40] in with what sincerity
[2:05:43] from the bottom of your heart you
[2:05:46] believe the bible is what
[2:05:48] that jesus christ god's son died in your
[2:05:50] water
[2:05:51] that's why roof has to be brought into a
[2:05:54] place
[2:05:55] where boaz is sleeping you have to come
[2:05:58] and meet christ's first recovery
[2:06:01] everybody clear
[2:06:03] you are not worthy of it
[2:06:07] you are unworthy you know it
[2:06:10] but because that you was unworthy
[2:06:14] god sent him the word one
[2:06:18] that you in your own wordiness
[2:06:21] might be sons and daughters of what
[2:06:24] that's why ruth have to go to the faith
[2:06:27] root was not a jew ruth was a
[2:06:31] gentile gentile are unworthy
[2:06:35] because we were strangers from the
[2:06:37] commonwealth of
[2:06:38] israel that's why the roman centurion
[2:06:42] said
[2:06:42] i am not worthy that you come under my
[2:06:45] roof
[2:06:46] you must approach god as an unworthy
[2:06:49] person
[2:06:50] if you need redemption from him
[2:06:53] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[2:06:56] lord
[2:06:57] then cover me with your heart your skirt
[2:07:00] which is the spirit because that spirit
[2:07:03] brings the bond of perfection
[2:07:05] which put a mark in your body everybody
[2:07:07] clear so far
[2:07:09] now let's go to ezekiel chapter 23.
[2:07:12] hallelujah everybody clear i'm sorry i'm
[2:07:15] rushing
[2:07:23] ezekiel 23.
[2:07:26] if you dare you can say amen let me go
[2:07:29] 35 miles here
[2:07:32] everybody clear the word of the lord
[2:07:35] came again to me saying
[2:07:37] son of them they were what
[2:07:40] two women the daughter of one mother
[2:07:43] ever clear and they committed
[2:07:47] warden in egypt because of the situation
[2:07:51] of life
[2:07:53] sometimes we find ourselves victim
[2:07:56] of circumstances anybody clear
[2:07:59] we grew up in the wrong room
[2:08:03] we grew up in a difficult situation
[2:08:06] we didn't know what to do we didn't know
[2:08:08] any better
[2:08:09] and then somebody took advantage of us
[2:08:12] and we lost
[2:08:13] our virginity everybody clear and they
[2:08:16] committed well done in what
[2:08:19] in egypt these women were in egypt
[2:08:24] now by default according to the message
[2:08:28] teaching
[2:08:29] egypt tapped the world
[2:08:33] everybody clear but there is another
[2:08:36] aspect
[2:08:37] of egypt that i'm going to bring unto
[2:08:39] you in the message talking
[2:08:42] brother branham says this hallelujah
[2:08:45] israel coming out of egypt
[2:08:48] was a tap of the anti-tab today
[2:08:53] egypt was the water now here
[2:08:56] egypt is the church this church
[2:09:00] is a nominal church
[2:09:04] anybody clear egypt was the church
[2:09:08] and israel represented the water
[2:09:11] so the bride must be pulled out of
[2:09:14] a denomination church
[2:09:19] are you following me egypt represented
[2:09:23] the world
[2:09:24] and egypt also represented denomination
[2:09:28] some of you came into the message
[2:09:31] straight from the
[2:09:32] world some of you came in the message
[2:09:35] from a denomination into the message
[2:09:38] you didn't know any better into the
[2:09:41] world
[2:09:42] you didn't know any better into the
[2:09:44] denomination
[2:09:45] because the nomination only provided
[2:09:48] the covering which is called religion
[2:09:52] that's why when eve and adam sinned they
[2:09:55] took the fig leaves
[2:09:57] and brother branham said fig leaps
[2:09:59] represented
[2:10:00] religion amen they only cover their sin
[2:10:04] but the seed were not remitted
[2:10:08] denomination will give you a shelter
[2:10:11] that you can go live and clean and then
[2:10:14] sunday you come to church you can go in
[2:10:17] a nightclub
[2:10:18] and behave like a devil and then on
[2:10:20] sunday you can sing into the quad
[2:10:23] denomination give you that umbrella
[2:10:26] but not the bride ever cleared so far
[2:10:30] israel came out of egypt so does the
[2:10:33] bread came out of the water
[2:10:36] the church see because there has to be
[2:10:39] something there
[2:10:40] for it to come out it's got to come out
[2:10:44] if it was a tap the church is down in
[2:10:47] egypt
[2:10:48] in the what in the water
[2:10:51] that's why denomination it's a worldly
[2:10:54] church
[2:10:57] it is a church that is in egypt
[2:11:00] and this church is connected to sin and
[2:11:03] it's all
[2:11:04] and it's also connected to unclean
[2:11:06] living
[2:11:08] everybody down in egypt in the world
[2:11:12] and in sin and does not care a thinker
[2:11:15] about the token they don't even believe
[2:11:18] it but
[2:11:19] israel loved it for it was the he was
[2:11:22] salvation to
[2:11:23] them so these two women here were in
[2:11:27] egypt
[2:11:28] some of them their egypt
[2:11:31] was completely a hundred percent in the
[2:11:34] world
[2:11:35] they didn't know anything some of you
[2:11:38] your egypt was denomination
[2:11:41] but yet you were not living a clean life
[2:11:45] you were going to church just like a
[2:11:48] muslim
[2:11:49] you were going to church just like for
[2:11:51] religion because
[2:11:53] everybody must go to church on sunday
[2:11:56] but there was no
[2:11:57] personal relationship with jesus christ
[2:12:00] everybody clear so far brother branham
[2:12:03] let's go he said and they commit one
[2:12:06] dumb in egypt
[2:12:08] they commit wardem in their word
[2:12:12] in their youth
[2:12:15] in their youth which age of youth are we
[2:12:18] talking about did they do it when they
[2:12:20] were two years
[2:12:22] let's see they committed weldom in their
[2:12:26] youth

[2:20:28] she had the
[2:20:29] sack a sacred trust of virtue committed
[2:20:32] to her by her lord
[2:20:34] a certain virtue nothing else hold it
[2:20:38] but a woman that is committed to her by
[2:20:41] god
[2:20:41] she must not defile that virtue if she
[2:20:45] even does something wrong
[2:20:46] she must do what dad she must confess
[2:20:51] that to her what
[2:20:52] not only do you confess to your parent
[2:20:56] the day before you get married
[2:20:59] you must tell that man that i am not
[2:21:02] virgin
[2:21:06] can you say amen avoid
[2:21:09] the hard road go the easy one
[2:21:13] and she even does something wrong she
[2:21:16] must confess that to her husband
[2:21:19] before he takes her and make it
[2:21:22] the same as the church that was married
[2:21:24] to the lord has to come also before
[2:21:27] christ
[2:21:28] before the second marriage she has to
[2:21:30] confess that
[2:21:31] if she does not she lives with her
[2:21:34] husband for how many years
[2:21:36] and then confesses he has a right to
[2:21:39] what
[2:21:40] and marry another woman that is what
[2:21:44] i just read to you the message
[2:21:48] perfectly learned with the bible

[2:21:55] sexual relationship before marriage
[2:21:58] is unclean living
[2:22:02] joseph feel not to take unto the married
[2:22:05] wife
[2:22:06] for that which is conceiving her is of
[2:22:08] the holy ghost
[2:22:09] he was murdered to do what put her away
[2:22:12] privately
[2:22:13] after he have already engaged to her
[2:22:16] when you are engaged to her
[2:22:18] as far as god is concerned you are
[2:22:20] married to her not
[2:22:22] to have sexual relationship yet until
[2:22:25] in the altar i have to underline that
[2:22:28] one
[2:22:29] everybody clear before you get a snake
[2:22:33] an interpretation she has a sacred trust
[2:22:36] of virtue
[2:22:38] that has been given her trusted to her
[2:22:40] by the lord
[2:22:41] god gave her the virtue just as he was
[2:22:45] in the garden of eden she can say yes
[2:22:48] or what sister you have a right to say
[2:22:52] yes
[2:22:53] or no even to god you have the right to
[2:22:56] say
[2:22:57] yes or no to god because he put you
[2:23:00] on the free moral agency she has a
[2:23:03] sacred trust of womanhood
[2:23:05] committed to her that she must not break
[2:23:08] what is movementhood

[2:23:12] her work
[2:23:14] many times what opened the door
[2:23:17] for the boys to play with you is the way
[2:23:20] you behave
[2:23:23] you are too loose around boys

[2:24:09] sacred virtue sacred womanhood
[2:24:12] sacred motherhood or not a husband what

[2:56:18] lust or temptation but every man
[2:56:23] is tempted when he he's joined what
[2:56:26] of his own what the mark is dead
[2:56:31] you don't cover up against that
[2:56:34] that's where the devil will begin to
[2:56:37] pull his magnet
[2:56:40] you this woman was drawn away by her
[2:56:43] own lust amen
[2:56:47] and what entice then when rest is what
[2:56:52] you agree with it in your heart it
[2:56:55] brings forth water
[2:56:57] and once sin is what it brings forth
[2:57:00] water
[2:57:01] slowly but graciously
[2:57:04] and securely god the devil is
[2:57:08] bringing you to the grave
[2:57:12] slowly move number one number two number
[2:57:16] three
[2:57:16] the end is death everybody
[2:57:20] praise the name of the lord when moses
[2:57:23] came out
[2:57:24] from his 40 days fasting up in the
[2:57:27] mountain
[2:57:28] where he had the two table of stone
[2:57:30] satan tempted him at what
[2:57:38] this mark is a mark of weakness
[2:57:41] when it comes from christ it will make
[2:57:45] you
[2:57:45] weak but with jesus
[2:57:49] when you are weak then he is
[2:57:54] that is his mark ever here but
[2:57:57] on the world either in egypt
[2:58:00] in the worldly condition or in
[2:58:02] denomination
[2:58:04] denmark is a different weakness
[2:58:07] it's a weakness that the devil used to
[2:58:10] punch you
[2:58:11] and once you get a punch it knocks you
[2:58:16] down
[2:58:18] satan tempted him at his weak spot
[2:58:21] that was his what satan look moses
[2:58:25] he tried this word moses solid try solid
[2:58:28] he said where is the weakness of moses
[2:58:32] he studied moses he said temper
[2:58:35] do you know what block moses said of the
[2:58:37] promised land
[2:58:39] he was water thank god amazing grace
[2:58:43] went over temple
[2:58:45] and took moses and put him on one
[2:58:47] transfiguration
[2:58:48] and said devil i would not lose any
[2:58:52] [Applause]
[2:58:55] are you there and he showed
[2:58:58] them the commandment and broke them but
[2:59:01] when
[2:59:02] satan met the lord jesus he knowed
[2:59:05] that was not what in other words the
[2:59:08] devil
[2:59:09] knows us individually the devil can
[2:59:12] differentiate this is divine
[2:59:15] this is brother kalima and he knows who
[2:59:18] you are
[2:59:19] and he knows where to shoot you but god
[2:59:22] said no temptation will come to you
[2:59:25] that is greater than your stress
[2:59:28] so when he comes remember you are always
[2:59:31] greater than him don't give him but
[2:59:35] stand firm
[2:59:38] hallelujah he knowed that was not
[2:59:41] moses he cut him at what
[2:59:45] which was water that's why he cursed the
[2:59:48] fig tree
[2:59:53] if that be the son of god command this
[2:59:56] stone to be turned to bread
[2:59:58] and eat because you are but he realized
[3:00:01] that was not who
[3:00:03] he didn't get him on his temper
[3:00:06] anybody there look how satan comes
[3:00:10] right up there and agree with every bit
[3:00:12] of that word
[3:00:14] he's just waiting to find that what
[3:00:18] in eve to where he could show his
[3:00:22] to water the power of deception
[3:00:26] of the devil is manifested in our weak
[3:00:30] spots
[3:00:35] to betray her that was satan and here
[3:00:39] satan
[3:00:39] in the form of what judas in that age
[3:00:43] that was satan in the first stage what
[3:00:45] was he
[3:00:46] agreeing with the word the word
[3:00:50] till just one little thing
[3:00:53] he's trying to find a place where he can
[3:00:56] get a what
[3:00:58] so these women by getting their mark
[3:01:02] forgot the power of the weakness
[3:01:06] and open the door again and begin

[3:11:05] of a lot of sacrifice not to worry your
[3:11:08] people
[3:11:09] but lord the hour is late that

[3:11:16] everything that we can further to bring
[3:11:19] your children
[3:11:20] home to a closer relationship with you
[3:11:23] where lord father the world will be
[3:11:26] completely dead
[3:11:28] and father you only you christ will take
[3:11:31] the preeminence
[3:11:33] father there are people here that got
[3:11:36] their scar
[3:11:38] into the world
[3:11:41] they are some dagger this car
[3:11:45] into denomination some of them
[3:11:48] even goddess car
[3:11:52] in their parent home not because they
[3:11:55] wanted to
[3:11:57] but it was just because advantage was
[3:11:59] taken over
[3:12:01] father some of them in the message
[3:12:03] churches
[3:12:04] saw things that made them
[3:12:10] to go astray in their own life
[3:12:14] because what they thought was the
[3:12:16] message example has not been
[3:12:18] displayed in their life father some are
[3:12:22] here
[3:12:23] that are not even going out but the
[3:12:26] devil has been tempering with them
[3:12:30] some because of these marks they built
[3:12:33] complex in their life where they can
[3:12:36] trust
[3:12:36] nobody where they can't even lord
[3:12:40] father have the freedom of their mind
[3:12:43] and yet you came to approach to tell the
[3:12:46] world
[3:12:47] father you didn't leave her because
[3:12:50] father
[3:12:51] she lost her virginity lord you even met
[3:12:55] her
[3:12:56] with already six
[3:12:59] and she was even living with the sixth
[3:13:02] one
[3:13:03] but because she was a seed of abraham
[3:13:06] lord you reach down and you snatch
[3:13:10] her completely out of the devil hands
[3:13:13] and you gave her lord father a different
[3:13:16] life a peace in her soul
[3:13:19] that even the pharisee could not even
[3:13:22] reach there
[3:13:23] because she had a representation
[3:13:26] father these messages are cutting
[3:13:30] these messages are heart-searching this
[3:13:33] message of things that comes and bring
[3:13:37] a man or a woman to drop their head down
[3:13:41] and say father if i knew better
[3:13:44] if i knew this i would not have done
[3:13:47] this
[3:13:48] father that shows already that it's a
[3:13:52] predestinated city
[3:13:54] that is laying there lord father our
[3:13:57] lives
[3:13:58] our lord peculiar because you deal with
[3:14:02] us in our individual work but lord
[3:14:05] father that does admit
[3:14:07] that you have not you have forsaken us
[3:14:09] you were not
[3:14:10] mindful of us because if you were not
[3:14:13] we could be still under the mark of the
[3:14:16] world
[3:14:17] but father lord jesus christ shows that
[3:14:20] your grace can reach in every corner
[3:14:23] he can reach in a man he can reach those
[3:14:26] that are not in the mind
[3:14:27] he can reach in every single limit lord
[3:14:30] and father you can bring your children
[3:14:32] home
[3:14:33] father may you comfort the heart of your
[3:14:36] children
[3:14:36] and make those that have been found in
[3:14:39] those situations
[3:14:40] father may you give peace to the heart
[3:14:42] lord father that your love has not been
[3:14:45] wavered

[3:14:49] father but
[3:14:50] you still love them the same way lord as
[3:14:53] they never done it

[3:14:56] age he preached the message
[3:14:58] justification
[3:14:59] father and he show us father the message
[3:15:03] to be justified
[3:15:04] in this age actually it means lord
[3:15:07] father
[3:15:08] that you have never done it father you
[3:15:10] brought
[3:15:11] such higher level of sanctification to
[3:15:14] your children
[3:15:14] to remove that guiltiness to remove that
[3:15:18] complex
[3:15:19] to remove the scar to remove that streak
[3:15:23] that has been hunting your people all
[3:15:25] the life
[3:15:26] so that they can be free and they can no
[3:15:29] longer
[3:15:29] live under condemnation but now
[3:15:33] they can look at their husband in their
[3:15:35] face and feel
[3:15:36] justified not because of their own
[3:15:38] righteousness
[3:15:39] but because of the righteousness of the
[3:15:42] lamb that has been brought lord
[3:15:44] in a higher level further through the
[3:15:46] message of the hour
[3:15:48] lord father may you touch the young
[3:15:50] people
[3:15:51] father may you give them a personal
[3:15:53] relationship
[3:15:54] may you mark our life lord may you mark
[3:15:57] a life lord
