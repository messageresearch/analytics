[40:32] you're saying that you believe
[40:34] [Music]
[40:35] let's turn to psalms 46 just as a
[40:38] scripture read and get started
[40:42] amen
[40:51] [Music]
[40:55] if you got it say amen
[40:58] amen
[40:59] if i sound like brother stephen up here
[41:01] tonight don't blame me
[41:04] his voice has been ringing in my head
[41:10] [Music]
[41:12] well imitation is the best form of
[41:14] flattery
[41:16] what a teacher what a teacher god has
[41:19] blessed us with a wonderful gift
[41:22] and i think that we should live lives
[41:24] that are worthy of that gift
[41:26] let's read
[41:28] god is our refuge
[41:33] oh we could just close the book and go
[41:34] home
[41:37] and strength
[41:39] a very present help
[41:42] in trouble
[41:45] we receive
[41:47] not the spirit of fear
[41:49] but the spirit of adoption
[41:52] whereby we cry
[41:54] abba father
[41:56] which is equivalent to say daddy daddy
[42:00] it's a very familial uh form of the word
[42:03] father it's something that a child would
[42:06] use towards his daddy whereby we cry so
[42:09] we have a relationship with god
[42:12] we respect god we have that fear for him
[42:15] but to be afraid of him to be afraid of
[42:17] his wrath that's all under the law
[42:20] amen
[42:22] oh my
[42:23] a very present help therefore will we
[42:25] not fear
[42:28] will not we fear though
[42:30] the earth be removed
[42:33] sounds like a pretty good earthquake to
[42:34] me
[42:36] though the mountains be carried into the
[42:38] midst of the sea and though the waters
[42:40] roar and be troubled
[42:43] though the mountains shake with the
[42:45] swelling thereof

[45:44] a thing
[45:46] the whole time four and a half hours i
[45:48] didn't say one thing brother stephen
[45:51] he got to the end he looked at me he
[45:52] said brother sam you didn't say anything
[45:55] he kind of stumbled me too
[45:57] but it was so good
[46:01] my my mind
[46:04] be still
[46:06] oh if those words could just anchor
[46:08] something
[46:09] be still

[46:17] little bit
[46:18] that i
[46:19] am god

[48:36] happen and how many knows that
[48:39] he didn't prevail
[48:42] [Music]
[48:44] thus fulfilling
[48:45] the words of our lord the gates of hell
[48:48] cannot prevail
[48:51] oh my
[48:53] god
[48:57] there was such a harmony in that meeting
[49:01] it was one mind
[49:02] [Music]
[49:04] one heart
[49:06] one accord
[49:08] young
[49:09] old i being amongst the latter
[49:16] i'm getting pretty close to 20 though
[49:18] brother abel
[49:26] amen
[49:28] i just got a little further to travel
[49:30] than some of you
[49:35] but the questions that was asked two
[49:37] questions
[49:40] but then the questions to the questions
[49:42] to the questions to the questions
[49:46] two and a half hours of four and a half
[49:48] hours i'm sorry four and a half hours
[49:50] this is not including the meal
[49:52] this is just the time that we were in
[49:54] the questions and answers
[49:56] four and a half hours
[49:59] and everybody was
[50:01] so in tune
[50:04] and you could see as the wisdom
[50:07] and the knowledge was being ushered out
[50:09] by our lord jesus christ
[50:11] not only through our pastor
[50:14] but for the everybody in the in the
[50:16] audience
[50:19] our brother polycarp i wish i could
[50:21] understand french
[50:29] when i was in germany brother uh stephen
[50:31] there was a brother came then we were up
[50:32] at ewald frank's church
[50:35] and i spoke very little german
[50:38] and he spoke very little english
[50:41] so between his broken english and my
[50:43] broken german we were communicating
[50:46] and i'll never forget he looked at me he
[50:47] was just a little bit frustrated because
[50:49] he couldn't communicate the way he
[50:50] wanted to communicate
[50:52] and he said in him
[50:54] there will be van speak
[50:56] [Laughter]
[51:03] friends
[51:04] this harmony
[51:06] is that one speak
[51:08] all hearts in one heart one mind one
[51:11] accord
[51:18] you talk about heavenly places
[51:22] you know the word have the the term
[51:24] heavenly places paul only used it in the
[51:26] book of ephesians
[51:29] and he was speaking to the elect
[51:33] speaking to the elect talking about
[51:35] being in heavenly places in christ jesus
[51:37] you won't find it in the new testament
[51:39] anywhere else
[51:41] only to the ephesians and we know that
[51:42] the book of ephesians parallels the book
[51:45] of joshua
[51:47] which is the time that they were taking
[51:49] possession
[51:51] of the promise that god had made them
[51:57] i hope you're reading between the lines
[52:00] friends we must realize that we are
[52:03] living in the time when we are taking
[52:06] possession
[52:07] of what god has made promised
[52:10] not only to us
[52:12] but they without us
[52:15] cannot be made perfect
[52:22] and i want to say one more thing and i
[52:23] want everybody paying attention to me
[52:26] because this is important
[52:28] and you have to know
[52:30] your place in the body
[52:32] and you have to know your importance in
[52:35] the body
[52:36] because if you're a part of that elect
[52:39] we
[52:40] without you cannot be made perfect
[52:47] i don't care how old you are
[52:52] just a little bitty child
[52:55] is the one
[52:56] that that told naaman about a prophet
[52:59] that was over in the land of israel that
[53:02] could cleanse him of his leprosy
[53:05] every person every uh every beating
[53:08] heart
[53:09] in this assembly is important to the
[53:12] economy of god and do not think negative
[53:15] of one soul in here if you see somebody
[53:19] that's getting a little bit out of line
[53:22] don't criticize them
[53:24] just do what the prophet did get in line
[53:27] get in line get in line the hour is late
[53:30] friends
[53:34] we don't know when that call is coming
[53:35] forth
[53:43] friends i i i wondered about that
[53:45] meeting when i got home brother stephen
[53:48] it was so rich
[53:51] and it was so much if i could ever
[53:53] imagine what it was like
[53:55] in the upper room
[53:57] before the coming down of the the the
[54:00] the cloven tongues of fire
[54:03] they were i don't think that they was
[54:05] cumbered because they'd been there ten
[54:07] days
[54:09] they'd been in prayer
[54:11] for 10 days
[54:13] we're thinking four and a half hours is
[54:14] pretty good
[54:19] can you imagine 120 people gathered in
[54:23] one room for ten
[54:25] days
[54:28] they had to pass from time to eternity
[54:34] could it be friends
[54:37] could it be
[54:38] that we are actually getting into that
[54:40] place
[54:41] to where time
[54:43] is blending into eternity
[54:50] we're building a platform
[54:54] i believe the lord has something that
[54:55] he'd like to share with us tonight
[54:58] and if i can get it out
[55:00] the way it came to me it will be a
[55:02] blessing
[55:06] now we all know that brother branham
[55:09] when he went um
[55:12] when he was a young boy he was shot
[55:14] right remember that he was shot
[55:17] this is in the message souls that are in
[55:19] prison now
[55:21] i think i'm gonna just start skipping a
[55:22] couple pages because this
[55:25] is gonna take some time
[55:29] so we're gonna just fast forward
[55:32] and so he was shot
[55:35] and whilst he was
[55:37] was a bleeding
[55:39] he went into a a vision a trend i don't
[55:42] think he knew exactly what but he
[55:43] visited the the uh the the regions of
[55:47] the lost
[55:49] and in the regions of the lost
[55:52] see if i can find it here and just read
[55:54] it to you
[56:00] he said the vision struck me and i was
[56:01] so weak i had lost that blood
[56:05] and went and i was sinking
[56:07] into an endless eternity
[56:10] many of you may have heard me tell
[56:12] this before
[56:14] and sinking into an endless eternity
[56:17] first i was going down through like
[56:18] clouds and then through darkness
[56:21] and sinking on down
[56:23] down down and the first thing you know i
[56:26] got to the regions of the lost
[56:29] and in there i screamed the first thing
[56:31] you know
[56:33] i got into the regions of the lost i
[56:34] screamed
[56:37] and i looked and there just everything
[56:40] there was no foundation i could never
[56:42] stop falling for eternity looked like i
[56:44] was going to fall there was no stopping
[56:47] nowhere
[56:52] he said then what a difference that was
[56:53] from the vision i had here not long ago
[56:55] being in glory
[56:57] with the with the people the contrast
[56:59] remember when he went beyond the curtain
[57:01] of time
[57:02] so brother branham visited both places
[57:04] the regions of the rot lost and the
[57:06] regions of the blessed but let's
[57:07] continue here
[57:10] he said of course just being a kid
[57:12] i would scream i screamed for my daddy
[57:16] and i was just falling i finally
[57:18] that's all i could do was scream i
[57:20] screamed for my daddy and my daddy
[57:22] wasn't there and i screamed for my
[57:23] mother somebody somebody catch me
[57:28] there was no mother there
[57:30] i was just going
[57:32] i screamed
[57:33] then to god
[57:35] and there was no god there
[57:37] there was nothing
[57:38] and after a while i heard the most
[57:40] mournful sound that i ever heard
[57:43] think about this
[57:44] think about this this is this we're
[57:46] going to find out this is becoming
[57:48] material on earth now
[57:51] right now
[57:53] the hideous sights that i'm seeing right
[57:55] now
[57:57] and brother branham thought hell did
[57:58] that to him
[58:00] look at this
[58:02] there was nothing there no god there and
[58:04] after a while i heard the most mournful
[58:06] sound that i ever heard it was the
[58:08] awfulest feeling
[58:10] there's no way
[58:11] listen to what he says
[58:13] even
[58:14] a literal
[58:16] burning
[58:17] fire
[58:18] would be a pleasure to decide of what
[58:20] this was
[58:25] now those visions has never been wrong
[58:28] just one of the most horrible feelings i
[58:30] ever had
[58:32] and what did
[58:33] and you know i think sometimes
[58:35] in order to comprehend what god is
[58:38] giving us here we have to almost realize
[58:41] what that other side is like
[58:43] because you know brother branham came
[58:45] along and he preached that message the
[58:47] token
[58:48] which was the literal life of jesus
[58:51] christ come back upon the believers
[58:54] we're going to get to that in a minute
[58:56] but do you know what he preached that
[58:57] night
[58:59] what did he preach brother robert
[59:01] desperation
[59:02] exactly right
[59:04] and sometimes i just wonder
[59:06] you've got to realize saints we're
[59:08] living in laodicea
[59:10] we're living in a lukewarm age and you
[59:12] can't live in a lukewarm age
[59:14] if you're being controlled by your seed
[59:16] steel smelling here at all
[59:19] your conscience your reason your memory
[59:20] your imagination your affection if
[59:22] that's got any control on you at all
[59:24] it's going to weaken your faith
[59:31] i want you to see the desperation here
[59:33] let me drop this as we go
[59:36] let me drop this as we go
[59:38] how many were
[59:40] at the resurrection of jesus christ
[59:44] anybody know
[59:46] the bible says above 500.
[59:50] how many were in the upper room
[59:55] what happened to the rest of them
[1:00:01] do you see the sincerity
[1:00:04] and what did brother branham tell us he
[1:00:05] said you have to be more
[1:00:08] sincere
[1:00:09] we just have to be more sincere
[1:00:13] and i believe that's what it's going to
[1:00:14] take church for us to come to this level
[1:00:18] that jesus christ is trying to bring us
[1:00:20] to to get us in behind that curtain to
[1:00:23] get us into that inner veil to where
[1:00:25] that were in his presence
[1:00:31] how many knows that you're justified by
[1:00:33] faith
[1:00:35] luke 17 i mean um
[1:00:38] was ex
[1:00:40] once that romans romans 1 17
[1:00:43] the just shall live by faith
[1:00:46] is that right
[1:00:48] how many knows you're sanctified by
[1:00:50] faith
[1:00:53] right
[1:00:55] anybody need a scripture for that
[1:00:58] i got it written down here
[1:01:04] we're justified by faith
[1:01:07] we're sanctified by faith
[1:01:10] turn to acts 26
[1:01:13] 18
[1:01:15] acts 26 18 these are the words of jesus
[1:01:18] christ himself
[1:01:19] as he's talking to paul
[1:01:23] this just goes to show you the
[1:01:24] importance of faith and faith comes by
[1:01:27] hearing
[1:01:29] and hearing by the word
[1:01:38] yes
[1:02:02] okay here we go
[1:02:04] let's start with 15. and i said who art
[1:02:07] thou lord and he said i am jesus whom
[1:02:09] now persecute us
[1:02:11] but rise and stand upon thy feet
[1:02:14] for i have appeared unto thee for this
[1:02:17] purpose
[1:02:20] to make thee a minister and a witness
[1:02:23] both of these things which thou has seen
[1:02:26] and those things which
[1:02:28] i will appear unto thee
[1:02:30] delivering thee from the
[1:02:32] from the people and from the gentiles
[1:02:34] unto whom now i send thee
[1:02:38] to open their eyes
[1:02:40] and to turn them from darkness to light
[1:02:43] and from the power of satan
[1:02:45] unto god that they might receive
[1:02:47] forgiveness of sin and inheritance among
[1:02:50] them
[1:02:51] which are sanctified by faith
[1:02:57] so in the outer court we're justified by
[1:02:59] faith
[1:03:01] in the holy place
[1:03:04] we're sanctified by faith
[1:03:10] and the outer courts where we see taste
[1:03:13] feel smelling here
[1:03:15] we're still affected by the outside the
[1:03:17] the the we can feel the sun the rain
[1:03:22] inner court brother brown said those
[1:03:25] those uh you're in your spirit realm
[1:03:27] it's your conscience your reasoning your
[1:03:29] imaginations your memories and your
[1:03:31] affections
[1:03:33] but we're still justified by faith we're
[1:03:35] still sanctified by faith
[1:03:38] but when we get in behind that veil
[1:03:41] we live by faith
[1:03:45] every one of the other ten senses
[1:03:47] is con is controlled by faith alone
[1:03:52] that's that sixth sense
[1:03:54] and that's what he's bringing us to
[1:03:57] he's bringing us to a place to where he
[1:04:00] what he says we believe it and we're not
[1:04:02] looking for any other outcome except for
[1:04:04] the outcome that he intended for us
[1:04:08] that's his purpose
[1:04:11] now
[1:04:13] brother stephen i'm gonna have to get
[1:04:15] that uh
[1:04:16] powerpoint down because keeping these
[1:04:18] paper swords is not easy
[1:04:23] wow
[1:04:28] okay
[1:04:30] okay here we go
[1:04:33] now
[1:04:34] and after a while i heard okay we read
[1:04:36] that
[1:04:38] oh this is what i want to get to and i
[1:04:39] heard a noise something like a haunted
[1:04:41] affair
[1:04:42] and when i looked
[1:04:44] coming it was women
[1:04:46] and they had green stuff
[1:04:48] just see it in their face they had green
[1:04:51] stuff under their eyes
[1:04:54] and their eyes look like run back
[1:04:57] i see this in cracker barrel all the
[1:04:59] time
[1:05:01] they got cat's eyes
[1:05:06] it's good to see the hamiltons again
[1:05:13] this one this one this one
[1:05:15] um well she she used to work with us
[1:05:18] derek
[1:05:19] elainey you know who i'm talking about
[1:05:21] she looks like a clown
[1:05:29] it hurts me
[1:05:33] she had a little star stuck on her
[1:05:34] forehead right here
[1:05:40] if this disturbed the prophet what would
[1:05:41] he do if he saw what we're looking at
[1:05:49] green stuff
[1:05:52] and their eyes look run back like the
[1:05:54] women uh
[1:05:55] today paint their eyes run back like
[1:05:57] that
[1:05:58] and their eyes and their face and
[1:05:59] they're going oh
[1:06:04] [Music]
[1:06:06] oh my i just screamed
[1:06:10] oh god have mercy on me have mercy o god
[1:06:13] where are you
[1:06:14] if you only let me go back and live i
[1:06:17] promise you to be a good boy
[1:06:20] that's the only thing i say god knows
[1:06:22] and on the day of judgment he'll judge
[1:06:24] me for that statement that's what i said
[1:06:26] lord god
[1:06:27] let me go back i promise to be a good
[1:06:30] boy and when i got shot i had told lies
[1:06:32] i've done pretty much everything to be
[1:06:34] done
[1:06:34] and i might as well get it cleaned out
[1:06:36] right now while i'm here now he said and
[1:06:38] when i looked and seen i was half blowed
[1:06:41] into
[1:06:42] almost i said god have mercy on me you
[1:06:46] know i've never committed adultery and
[1:06:48] that's the only thing that i could say
[1:06:49] to god
[1:06:50] and i never accepted his pardon
[1:06:53] but all i could say is i never did
[1:06:55] commit adultery
[1:06:57] and then they'd taken me out
[1:06:59] and there they were going on
[1:07:01] let's see uh skip a little bit and so
[1:07:04] help me the weary creatures all around
[1:07:06] and i had been a new revival i had been
[1:07:09] a new arrival and the most hideous
[1:07:10] horrible ungodly feeling looked like
[1:07:13] great
[1:07:14] big eyes big eyelashes out like that and
[1:07:17] run back like a cat
[1:07:28] my i'm glad it's hitting you the way it
[1:07:30] hit me
[1:07:32] and green stuff and canker and
[1:07:34] he's i'm just saying what he said
[1:07:36] and i can hear it on the tape you you
[1:07:39] can't say it the way he said it
[1:07:41] what a feeling
[1:07:44] then in a moment's time i'd come back to
[1:07:46] natural life and the thing has bothered
[1:07:48] me ever since
[1:07:49] and then seven months later he said
[1:07:52] he had a vision of being out west
[1:07:56] the cross exactly and the glory of god
[1:07:58] just pouring into him
[1:08:00] and he said i knew that there was a
[1:08:02] regions of the dam somewhere
[1:08:04] now i never noticed so much until about
[1:08:06] four weeks ago he said wife
[1:08:08] never thought of it on these terms about
[1:08:10] four weeks ago wife and i went down to
[1:08:12] tucson to do some shopping
[1:08:16] amen jc penney's
[1:08:19] and a young woman come by and said what
[1:08:21] do you think of that he said and so let
[1:08:23] me go on down here just a little bit
[1:08:24] save some time so i went upstairs and i
[1:08:27] sat down and when i did there was an
[1:08:29] escalator and it was a jc penny store
[1:08:31] and the escalator was bringing people up
[1:08:33] well i was turning my
[1:08:35] my sick at my stomach
[1:08:37] see those women there young old
[1:08:39] indifferent wrinkled
[1:08:41] young every way
[1:08:43] little bitty short son
[1:08:46] this is 1963.
[1:08:49] what would he say if he saw it now
[1:08:59] skipping a little and one coming right
[1:09:00] off the elevator just
[1:09:02] to the right like that i was sitting in
[1:09:04] back in my chair
[1:09:05] sitting with my head down
[1:09:07] and i turned and i looked and one of
[1:09:09] them coming up the steps saying ooh
[1:09:12] spanish speaking to another woman
[1:09:15] she was a white woman speaking spanish
[1:09:16] to the spanish woman
[1:09:18] and when i looked brother branham
[1:09:20] snapped his fingers
[1:09:23] all at once i was changed
[1:09:25] there
[1:09:26] and i had seen that before her eyes you
[1:09:29] know
[1:09:30] how
[1:09:31] the women are doing now painting their
[1:09:33] eyes just recently like cat
[1:09:36] you know
[1:09:37] put that green stuff under their eyes
[1:09:41] there was this
[1:09:42] was that thing that i seen when i was a
[1:09:45] child
[1:09:46] there was the woman just exactly i just
[1:09:49] got numb all over
[1:09:54] now he preached that in the morning
[1:09:56] of um
[1:09:58] when he preached souls that are in
[1:10:00] prison now
[1:10:05] that was on
[1:10:08] november the 10th
[1:10:10] now that evening he preached another
[1:10:12] message
[1:10:13] and the message that he preached that
[1:10:15] evening was he that is in you
[1:10:19] and in the message he that's in you
[1:10:22] he recounts another time when he was
[1:10:25] uh
[1:10:26] out on colorado
[1:10:28] and that storm came up
[1:10:30] and the lord told him to speak to the
[1:10:32] storm
[1:10:34] and when he spoke to the storm and the
[1:10:36] storm went away then he was walking
[1:10:38] across the mountains and he had a burden
[1:10:40] in his heart
[1:10:41] and he was praying that god would lift
[1:10:43] that burden from him
[1:10:46] and he said and it goes on and on but
[1:10:48] just
[1:10:50] he come to a point to where he said all
[1:10:51] of a sudden he said everything changed
[1:10:54] and i was in every bit i was just like i
[1:10:57] was when i was a young man again
[1:11:01] so just think in the morning he was
[1:11:03] remembering the regions of the lost and
[1:11:05] that same night he's preaching he that
[1:11:07] is in you and he's recounting a time to
[1:11:10] where that he was actually
[1:11:12] taken to the point of being in a rapture
[1:11:14] where he turned young again
[1:11:21] we want to get to a place friends
[1:11:24] to where we're so sincere with god
[1:11:27] we're so sincere with our walk
[1:11:30] and we have to know that both of those
[1:11:32] uh places are there
[1:11:35] but we certainly don't want to go to
[1:11:37] that
[1:11:38] let's turn to romans 8
[1:11:41] and verse 28.
[1:12:01] this is a very familiar reading
[1:12:04] it's one that i've had on
[1:12:06] every bible that i've ever owned
[1:12:08] it says and we know
[1:12:11] that all of things work together for the
[1:12:15] good
[1:12:16] to them that love god
[1:12:18] and to them who are the called
[1:12:20] according to his
[1:12:23] purpose
[1:12:24] his purpose
[1:12:26] for whom he did for no
[1:12:28] he also did predestinate
[1:12:30] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:12:34] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:12:37] many brethren
[1:12:39] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[1:12:41] he also called and whom he called he
[1:12:44] also justified and whom he justified he
[1:12:47] also
[1:12:48] glorified what shall we say to these
[1:12:51] things then if god before us who can be
[1:12:53] against us
[1:12:56] now paul says here for we know
[1:12:59] and we know
[1:13:01] and we know
[1:13:02] and we know
[1:13:04] and we know
[1:13:08] i'm not repeating it because i don't
[1:13:10] know what it says
[1:13:12] those are three of the most important
[1:13:13] words in that entire verse
[1:13:16] we know
[1:13:18] our faith is anchored
[1:13:21] we have a revelation
[1:13:24] that everything that happens to us has
[1:13:27] not happened to us unless god knew it
[1:13:29] was going to happen to us
[1:13:34] and we love god
[1:13:39] amen
[1:13:40] how do we know we love god
[1:13:46] there you go there's one
[1:13:48] there's one
[1:13:50] we don't love the things of the world
[1:13:53] he said if you love the world and the
[1:13:55] things of the world the love of god is
[1:13:57] not even in you
[1:13:59] what is your soul feeding on
[1:14:05] what are you spending your time doing
[1:14:11] what's your idol time the time that you
[1:14:12] don't have to do do anything for anybody
[1:14:15] else but just you
[1:14:17] and you're alone all by yourself
[1:14:21] and you can turn on a movie or you can
[1:14:23] turn on a tape
[1:14:32] you can turn on brother shambo
[1:14:35] or you can turn on gun smoke
[1:14:43] i like the smoke that he delivers
[1:14:47] i'm being serious friends
[1:14:50] let me tell you something we're all
[1:14:51] going to come to that point one day
[1:14:54] we have got to give an answer for what
[1:14:56] we have done in this flesh
[1:14:59] what have we done with the time that god
[1:15:01] has given us
[1:15:05] did you ever think of the word present
[1:15:10] it's got two meanings
[1:15:13] it's a gift
[1:15:15] it's also a period of time
[1:15:17] and it doesn't last very long
[1:15:20] that's why the bible says redeeming the
[1:15:22] time redeeming the time because the days
[1:15:25] are evil
[1:15:30] and we know
[1:15:33] all things
[1:15:34] work together for the good
[1:15:36] to them who love god and to them who are
[1:15:38] the called according to his purpose
[1:15:42] now in order to get the full impact of
[1:15:43] this you have to realize that something
[1:15:45] took place in romans chapter seven
[1:15:50] if you did not have something take place
[1:15:52] in romans chapter 7 in romans chapter 8
[1:15:54] doesn't even apply to you
[1:15:59] that first nature must die
[1:16:02] and the invisible union brother branham
[1:16:04] said you don't just hang him up to the
[1:16:07] occasion
[1:16:08] you don't put him in the closet until
[1:16:10] you're until you you just want to have a
[1:16:13] little time
[1:16:15] give your flesh a little you want to
[1:16:17] kill your flesh
[1:16:19] everything about your flesh
[1:16:21] that nature that you was born with
[1:16:22] that's got to die
[1:16:24] or you're unlawfully married to christ
[1:16:28] do you realize that you'll be one of the
[1:16:29] ones that come up on that day and your
[1:16:31] your house will be all cleaned and
[1:16:33] garnished and swept
[1:16:36] but you never allowed him to come in and
[1:16:38] possess you
[1:16:44] this is the time of possession
[1:16:47] we are possessing the promises that god
[1:16:50] left for us
[1:16:57] but now let's just say that we've all
[1:16:59] been through romans 7 and we've all died
[1:17:01] to our first husband
[1:17:03] we've been through that
[1:17:09] then we could wake up in romans chapter
[1:17:11] eight
[1:17:12] there is therefore now
[1:17:14] no
[1:17:15] condemnation
[1:17:18] that word condemnation means there's no
[1:17:19] judgment
[1:17:21] to those which are in christ jesus who
[1:17:23] walk not after the flesh
[1:17:27] now ask yourself
[1:17:30] you may as well face it now because if
[1:17:32] you don't face it now you're going to
[1:17:33] face it then
[1:17:37] judgment begins in the house of god
[1:17:42] and if you judge yourself you won't be
[1:17:44] judged
[1:17:53] i find a lot of people don't mind being
[1:17:54] judges
[1:17:56] they love to be a judge
[1:17:59] but they're judging everybody but
[1:18:01] themselves
[1:18:05] i told them to let me use use me tonight
[1:18:07] so so if if if something comes out blame
[1:18:10] it on boaz
[1:18:13] boaz made me do it
[1:18:19] friends we need this
[1:18:21] we need this we don't realize the time
[1:18:22] that we're living in
[1:18:24] do you realize
[1:18:26] that the hell is being poured out on
[1:18:28] earth
[1:18:31] do you realize that the ecclesiastical
[1:18:33] system is all set up
[1:18:35] for for for the tribulation period
[1:18:39] do you believe that the do you know that
[1:18:40] the political system is all set up for
[1:18:43] the
[1:18:43] tribulation period
[1:18:46] oh he's going to have his day in the hay
[1:18:48] we won't be here to see it thank you
[1:18:50] jesus
[1:18:52] brother brown says before one bomb drops
[1:18:57] the bride will be in glory
[1:18:59] before one drop of rain fell
[1:19:02] nose in the yard
[1:19:10] now i told you about the title must of
[1:19:12] my message tonight the one that the lord
[1:19:14] gave me i believe
[1:19:15] was serving his purpose
[1:19:19] and it says we know that all things were
[1:19:21] together for the good to them that love
[1:19:23] god and to them who are the called
[1:19:26] according to his purpose
[1:19:30] now before you can serve his purpose
[1:19:34] you have to know his purpose
[1:19:41] and i want to just give you a little
[1:19:42] clue before we get too far into this
[1:19:46] finding your purpose
[1:19:47] is a personal relationship to jesus
[1:19:52] christ
[1:19:53] your pastor can't show you your purpose
[1:19:55] your mommy can't show you your purpose
[1:19:58] your daddy can't show you your purpose
[1:20:00] jesus christ himself did not show peter
[1:20:05] that he was the christ
[1:20:09] the bible said flesh and blood has not
[1:20:11] revealed this unto you peter
[1:20:14] but my father which is in heaven and if
[1:20:17] you want to know what your purpose is
[1:20:19] get a prayer life
[1:20:21] learn how to get if you have to do it as
[1:20:24] our brother's been teaching us
[1:20:25] legalistically
[1:20:28] know that it's just the right thing to
[1:20:30] do to get on your knees and pray before
[1:20:33] your god and if you have to just sit
[1:20:36] there with a blank mind sit there with a
[1:20:38] blank mind just keep telling him how
[1:20:39] much you love him how much you
[1:20:41] appreciate him because he inhabits the
[1:20:44] praises of his saints
[1:20:50] but i'll tell you what he doesn't
[1:20:52] inhabit
[1:20:55] and if he needs scripture i got it
[1:20:58] he doesn't inhabit murmuring
[1:21:01] he doesn't inhabit complaining
[1:21:06] he doesn't inhabit negativity
[1:21:10] he doesn't inhabit gossip
[1:21:16] well we may as well just hit it real
[1:21:18] good brother stephen
[1:21:20] you know when they come along and say we
[1:21:22] gotta pray for that sister you know that
[1:21:29] come on let's grow up
[1:21:31] let's grow up
[1:21:34] you don't have to give all the details
[1:21:37] there's a sister i know that's
[1:21:39] struggling let's pray for
[1:21:42] just that simple amen
[1:21:47] amen
[1:21:51] now we've got to find our purpose
[1:21:54] but in order to find your purpose
[1:21:55] brother stephen you got to know where
[1:21:57] your purpose is at
[1:22:01] how do we find our purpose
[1:22:05] i want to tell you something you will
[1:22:07] not find your purpose
[1:22:09] that god intended for you
[1:22:11] if you do not have a prayer life
[1:22:17] brother sam
[1:22:20] are you serious
[1:22:23] well it was jesus that said father i
[1:22:25] thank you because you hid these things
[1:22:28] hid these things
[1:22:30] from the wise and prudent
[1:22:32] but he said that he revealed it and
[1:22:35] brother branham said unto babes such as
[1:22:38] would learn
[1:22:40] so when you humble yourself and you come
[1:22:43] to god as a little child and look i just
[1:22:46] want to share this with you because i
[1:22:48] feel bad for the rich young ruler
[1:22:51] i really do
[1:22:58] look at him
[1:23:01] he got one of them attitude looks isn't
[1:23:03] he
[1:23:05] who
[1:23:06] right
[1:23:08] do you realize that he was looking
[1:23:13] he was looking heaven in the face
[1:23:21] and jesus turned and looked at him he
[1:23:24] said go sell all you have
[1:23:27] give it to the poor
[1:23:30] and you'll have riches in heaven
[1:23:32] we're talking about eternal life
[1:23:40] i often wonder brother stephen and i put
[1:23:42] myself in this man's shoes
[1:23:45] i mean he was rich
[1:23:47] but moses was rich too
[1:23:49] [Music]
[1:23:55] we can walk away from riches
[1:23:58] we can walk away from anything that will
[1:24:00] separate us from the love of god
[1:24:06] [Applause]
[1:24:08] brother stephen i wish i was there that
[1:24:09] day
[1:24:11] because when i saw him walking away you
[1:24:12] know what i'd have done
[1:24:15] i had to run after him
[1:24:17] and i had grabbed him i said brother
[1:24:19] brother brother you you don't know what
[1:24:20] you're doing you're making a bad mistake
[1:24:21] here
[1:24:22] he said well i've got great riches i
[1:24:24] can't do that
[1:24:27] do you know what i would have said to
[1:24:28] him brother seth
[1:24:30] i would have said when he told you to
[1:24:32] give his way your riches
[1:24:34] and give it to the poor
[1:24:36] and you looked at him and said it was
[1:24:38] too hard for you to do
[1:24:40] did you ever stop and think about asking
[1:24:43] him to help you
[1:24:45] [Music]
[1:24:50] my bible said if i ask
[1:25:01] if i seek
[1:25:04] amen it's easy church to preach to you
[1:25:06] brother stephen it's an easy church
[1:25:09] it's an easy
[1:25:10] church
[1:25:12] now look
[1:25:15] i ask i receive
[1:25:18] i seek
[1:25:19] i find
[1:25:22] watch this
[1:25:23] stay with me a
[1:25:24] second i knock
[1:25:28] he opens
[1:25:31] that's the revelation brother
[1:25:34] if we will do the asking
[1:25:38] brother if you will do the seeking
[1:25:42] you will do the receiving
[1:25:44] you'll do the finding
[1:25:46] and when you knock
[1:25:48] you'll
[1:25:49] open it
[1:25:51] and he'll come in and sup with you
[1:25:54] and you'll sup with him
[1:25:59] amen i wish i'd have been there on that
[1:26:01] day
[1:26:02] because we know the end of his story
[1:26:06] and we don't want that
[1:26:09] determine in your heart whatever it
[1:26:11] takes and remember what we're looking
[1:26:13] for we are looking for the literal
[1:26:16] life
[1:26:17] of jesus christ come back upon the
[1:26:20] believer
[1:26:22] amen
[1:26:25] the literal life
[1:26:27] brother branham said if i had the spirit
[1:26:29] of beethoven in me
[1:26:34] and if i had the spirit of of dillinger
[1:26:36] in me
[1:26:38] see
[1:26:41] but we've got the spirit of christ
[1:26:47] i wish there was ways that you could
[1:26:49] just
[1:26:50] you you're pouring yourself out
[1:26:53] in romans chapter seven dying out to
[1:26:55] that nature
[1:26:58] romans chapter eight
[1:27:00] look at romans chapter eight
[1:27:04] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:27:07] to them which are in christ jesus who
[1:27:09] walk not after the flesh but after the
[1:27:11] spirit for the law of the spirit of life
[1:27:13] of christ has made me free
[1:27:15] from the law of sin and death for the
[1:27:17] law could not do and that it was weak
[1:27:20] through the flesh
[1:27:21] god sending his own son in the likeness
[1:27:24] of sinful flesh and for sin condemn sin
[1:27:28] in the flesh that the righteousness of
[1:27:30] the law might be fulfilled in
[1:27:34] us
[1:27:36] in us
[1:27:41] now look
[1:27:42] verse 11
[1:27:43] if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:27:46] christ from the dead
[1:27:48] dwell in you
[1:27:49] he that raised up christ from the dead
[1:27:51] shall also quicken your mortal bodies
[1:27:55] by the spirit of him that dwelleth where
[1:27:59] in you
[1:28:01] so now we know that if we're serving his
[1:28:03] purpose yes
[1:28:10] i better bring my paper with me
[1:28:17] we have to know where to look
[1:28:22] the word for purpose is
[1:28:37] watch this
[1:28:46] i want to put this over here
[1:28:48] after i've done this a few times i'll be
[1:28:50] better at it
[1:28:52] prosthesis
[1:28:55] that's the greek word for purpose
[1:28:58] for purpose
[1:29:00] okay
[1:29:02] now watch this
[1:29:05] a purpose the definition of a purpose
[1:29:07] means the reason
[1:29:09] for which something is then
[1:29:11] created
[1:29:12] or for which something exists
[1:29:15] and every one of us have a purpose
[1:29:19] some of us have more than one purpose
[1:29:21] some of us are dennis and some of us are
[1:29:24] pastors
[1:29:26] and some of us are husbands so many
[1:29:28] purposes
[1:29:31] but every one of us have a purpose
[1:29:34] and we're called according to his
[1:29:37] purpose
[1:29:44] now the word prosthesis means purpose
[1:29:47] that's what it means
[1:29:49] but watch this here
[1:29:51] we take this word
[1:29:57] and we put that with prosthesis
[1:30:01] and so we got artes prosthesis
[1:30:06] pretty good huh
[1:30:08] anybody awake yet
[1:30:10] all right
[1:30:11] you ready for this now
[1:30:13] when you take these two greek words
[1:30:17] and you put them together
[1:30:19] you get
[1:30:22] look it up in the strong's concordance
[1:30:35] now we're serving
[1:30:37] his purpose
[1:30:40] where's the showbread at
[1:30:44] [Applause]
[1:30:49] amen
[1:30:54] now this is the only word that appears
[1:30:58] in romans 8 28.
[1:31:02] but when you look up the word
[1:31:04] showbread
[1:31:06] both these words appear
[1:31:12] so what i want everybody in here to
[1:31:14] understand what god was showing me
[1:31:17] i don't care how old you are
[1:31:22] pay attention
[1:31:24] the purpose
[1:31:26] for your life
[1:31:28] is hidden in the showbread
[1:31:35] you won't find that
[1:31:38] in romans 8 28
[1:31:41] it's hidden
[1:31:45] so now
[1:31:47] if we take the teaching that brother
[1:31:48] stephen's been teaching
[1:31:52] see how close i can come
[1:31:55] got the labor got the labor what we got
[1:31:58] we got the candlesticks
[1:32:01] we got the table i better get this right
[1:32:04] it's like taking a test
[1:32:06] [Laughter]
[1:32:10] bruh and we got the altar of incense
[1:32:15] am i missing anything
[1:32:19] the show bro that's right here that's
[1:32:21] right here show bread
[1:32:22] sure but i ain't got room enough i don't
[1:32:24] have room enough for the wine yet but
[1:32:25] it's the tables there
[1:32:27] okay
[1:32:29] there we go right there
[1:32:32] so now here we are we're
[1:32:34] justified
[1:32:37] and we're baptized
[1:32:39] sanctified and now we're coming to the
[1:32:41] holy place and what does he teach us
[1:32:43] that the light of the uh of the angel
[1:32:46] for your age
[1:32:47] is shining
[1:32:49] the light
[1:32:50] onto the show bread
[1:32:54] that pertains to you
[1:32:57] personally
[1:32:58] [Music]
[1:33:04] but you have to know that you're one of
[1:33:06] his
[1:33:08] there's two tests
[1:33:10] do you love the world and the things of
[1:33:12] the world
[1:33:13] then you don't love him
[1:33:16] let's get her like let's make black
[1:33:17] black and white white
[1:33:19] you out there tinkering with the things
[1:33:21] of the world
[1:33:22] don't come around and tell me you love
[1:33:24] my jesus
[1:33:25] [Music]
[1:33:27] but when jesus is the only thing
[1:33:30] you love him
[1:33:33] you love
[1:33:34] him with all your heart
[1:33:38] with all your mind
[1:33:40] with all your strength
[1:33:42] with all your soul
[1:33:44] [Music]
[1:33:51] then you can say you love him
[1:33:54] but it's to them that love him see this
[1:33:56] is condition though
[1:33:58] i hear people tell me all the time
[1:34:00] everything's working together for the
[1:34:02] good do you love him
[1:34:04] [Music]
[1:34:06] do you know what your purpose is
[1:34:09] do you know why he created you
[1:34:12] are you fulfilling your purpose
[1:34:14] are you just going on whining and
[1:34:16] complaining about everything that's gone
[1:34:18] wrong in your life if you believed him
[1:34:20] nothing's gone wrong in your life
[1:34:24] [Music]
[1:34:27] [Applause]
[1:34:30] [Music]
[1:34:40] teresa was driving
[1:34:41] she looked ahead and she said oh they're
[1:34:43] stopping they're stopping you know we
[1:34:44] get nervous down there when traffic
[1:34:46] starts to stop because you're crowded
[1:34:47] you can't go nowhere
[1:34:49] and i looked over i said honey if i'm
[1:34:52] supposed to be a church tonight
[1:34:54] they ain't enough demons in hell
[1:34:59] because i knew there was a purpose
[1:35:02] i hadn't been fellowshipping with him
[1:35:04] for the last two days
[1:35:06] for safe to set some sort of a traffic
[1:35:08] jam up and keep me from getting here
[1:35:12] and i want to tell you this every
[1:35:14] heartache
[1:35:15] every trial god has been preparing you
[1:35:19] because he's got a purpose for you
[1:35:22] and the reason that you're all
[1:35:24] discontented and the reason that you're
[1:35:26] not justified and you don't have peace
[1:35:28] it's because you don't know your purpose
[1:35:32] and you're not living in the purpose
[1:35:33] that god called you for
[1:35:51] let's talk about faith for a minute
[1:35:54] he says now this is a message called
[1:35:56] have faith in god
[1:35:59] oh plenty of time plenty of time
[1:36:02] nobody getting tired yet are you
[1:36:07] the best is yet to come
[1:36:11] in the message have faith in god he says
[1:36:13] now some thinks
[1:36:15] that it's a mental conception of the
[1:36:17] word
[1:36:18] but that's not right
[1:36:19] he said faith is a substance
[1:36:24] faith is not a mist
[1:36:26] a myth
[1:36:28] faith is a substance of things hoped for
[1:36:30] and the evidence of things
[1:36:34] not seen
[1:36:36] to have an evidence it must be a
[1:36:38] substance
[1:36:40] so it is just
[1:36:42] so it is not just something that you
[1:36:44] imagine in your mind
[1:36:46] it's something that absolutely you have
[1:36:58] can i just drop this
[1:37:02] if you don't have
[1:37:04] a spirit of forgiveness
[1:37:07] don't tell me you get faith
[1:37:12] because my bible tells me
[1:37:14] that when you stand praying
[1:37:17] forgive
[1:37:19] [Music]
[1:37:29] people try to tell me they've got faith
[1:37:31] and they're still holding grudges
[1:37:42] friends this is real
[1:37:45] when peter and john went through the
[1:37:47] gate called beautiful
[1:37:49] they said silver and gold have i none
[1:37:52] but such is i
[1:37:57] they didn't say such as the pastor has
[1:38:00] they didn't say such as the deacon has
[1:38:03] they didn't say such as the elders have
[1:38:07] they said such as i have
[1:38:10] [Music]
[1:38:13] give i unto you
[1:38:18] it's a substance
[1:38:20] it's another it's it's he says it's the
[1:38:23] evidence of things you do not have yet
[1:38:26] but you have the authority of god to say
[1:38:29] that you have it
[1:38:31] it's an evidence
[1:38:33] something you have in your heart
[1:38:37] so when abraham called things that were
[1:38:39] not as though they were he wasn't lying
[1:38:45] he had a substance
[1:38:48] and according to his substance he had it
[1:38:50] and he believed it
[1:38:59] here we go perfect faith message
[1:39:01] paragraph 112.
[1:39:04] what did i do
[1:39:05] i don't want this thing to dry out
[1:39:08] i might need it again
[1:39:15] we having fun yet
[1:39:18] this has been the last two days with me
[1:39:21] i've been bubbling
[1:39:22] i kept it from teresa
[1:39:26] i didn't tell her what i was going to do
[1:39:29] and the last two nights you know what we
[1:39:30] did we watched you
[1:39:33] and we did
[1:39:34] i said bye i said that's going to help
[1:39:36] my sermon just watching him
[1:39:42] i do want to say this with a very
[1:39:44] sincere heart
[1:39:47] if you don't go back and re-listen to
[1:39:48] them
[1:39:49] tapes
[1:39:50] you're missing it
[1:39:53] i guarantee you you cannot get
[1:39:54] everything that's said across this
[1:39:57] pulpit on a sunday
[1:39:59] in one listening to
[1:40:02] and it's been a real blessing to me to
[1:40:04] go back and listen
[1:40:07] i encourage you saying look we're
[1:40:09] talking about eternity
[1:40:11] you you heard what i would do to this
[1:40:13] rich young ruler if i'd have been there
[1:40:15] i'd have grabbed him by the collar why
[1:40:17] didn't you just ask him
[1:40:19] he'da helped you
[1:40:20] he could have showed you the the value
[1:40:23] of what he had to offer and the value of
[1:40:25] what he was trying to hold on to and by
[1:40:27] the time he got done sharing with you
[1:40:29] the value of what he had you wouldn't
[1:40:30] want nothing to do with your riches
[1:40:33] you'd have been begging people to go to
[1:40:34] the bank who would draw it for you
[1:40:38] ah don't you see what satan's doing he's
[1:40:41] robbing us of our opportunity he's
[1:40:43] robbing us of our present time he's
[1:40:46] robbing us of our ability to spend time
[1:40:48] in his presence and see what purpose he
[1:40:51] has and let me tell you some friends he
[1:40:53] might have a purpose for you today but
[1:40:55] you might need to know what your purpose
[1:40:57] is tomorrow
[1:40:58] we can't just get a purpose and then lay
[1:41:00] down and say we got our purpose
[1:41:04] i don't know what god wants for me next
[1:41:06] week
[1:41:10] if somebody would told me i was gonna be
[1:41:12] in this pulpit last friday i said i
[1:41:14] don't think so
[1:41:21] we don't know
[1:41:23] but when i got the call i had to do some
[1:41:24] praying
[1:41:29] jesus lived in a world that no one knew
[1:41:31] anything about let's do this quickly now
[1:41:33] he was an odd person he lived in a world
[1:41:35] of perfect faith and a perfect god
[1:41:39] thank you brother kelly
[1:41:41] i love brother kelly
[1:41:44] if i could have just half the energy
[1:41:46] that man's got
[1:41:58] he lived in a world of perfect faith and
[1:42:01] a perfect god
[1:42:03] in which he was
[1:42:07] that went over pretty good didn't it
[1:42:10] all right stay alert
[1:42:16] if we lived
[1:42:18] in a perfect faith
[1:42:20] of a christian
[1:42:22] to what we are
[1:42:25] we'd be a mystic to the world
[1:42:30] the people wouldn't understand you
[1:42:35] you'd walk in the spirits
[1:42:41] what does the galatians say about
[1:42:43] walking in the spirit
[1:42:47] it says if you walk in the spirit you
[1:42:49] won't fulfill the lust of the flesh
[1:42:53] bingo
[1:43:05] number one if you're having trouble with
[1:43:07] the lust of the flesh you're not walking
[1:43:08] in the spirit
[1:43:12] number two
[1:43:15] if you don't want to walk in the flesh
[1:43:17] of the flesh
[1:43:18] get in the spirit
[1:43:28] i like that thing
[1:43:31] if we lived in a perfect faith of a
[1:43:33] christian to what we are we'd be a
[1:43:35] mystic to the world that people wouldn't
[1:43:37] understand you'd walk in the spirit what
[1:43:39] the spirit said you would do
[1:43:42] look at philip
[1:43:44] he's down there in a revival thousands
[1:43:45] of people the spirit says go out there
[1:43:48] one person
[1:43:50] gone didn't make any sense anybody
[1:43:53] around him
[1:43:55] what the spirit said you would do and
[1:43:57] what it forbid you would not do
[1:44:00] then the people begin to say they
[1:44:02] they say you'd be a mystic to them
[1:44:05] now listen
[1:44:07] how many
[1:44:09] let me see your show hands how many is a
[1:44:11] believer
[1:44:14] well i got some young hands up there
[1:44:17] anybody else want to put their hands up
[1:44:18] once we got a hands up keep them up
[1:44:20] there for a minute i won't see if i get
[1:44:21] any other hands to go up
[1:44:23] okay well we got the majority believers
[1:44:25] here
[1:44:26] so this pertains to you what i'm about
[1:44:28] to read
[1:44:31] he said that's the way it is to all
[1:44:34] believers
[1:44:36] they are mystic
[1:44:38] the people don't understand because they
[1:44:40] live in a world to themselves
[1:44:43] jesus lived in a world that nobody else
[1:44:45] could touch
[1:44:47] the
[1:44:48] disciples couldn't understand him
[1:44:51] when he spoke to him they said this and
[1:44:53] then they say
[1:44:54] why you you talking riddles we don't
[1:44:57] understand this
[1:44:59] how can this be
[1:45:01] see
[1:45:02] they wasn't in the world that he lived
[1:45:05] in
[1:45:05] they couldn't understand him
[1:45:08] nobody could understand him
[1:45:10] and so when a man
[1:45:12] lives by faith
[1:45:15] for we know
[1:45:17] for we know
[1:45:19] we don't have one speck of doubt
[1:45:22] when we say for we know that means we
[1:45:24] believe
[1:45:27] we can sing the song only believe
[1:45:30] because we're believers and if i quote
[1:45:34] tim pruitt he says
[1:45:36] we believe because we're believers and
[1:45:39] that's what believers do
[1:45:46] i thought it was pretty profound
[1:45:51] now listen to this friends
[1:45:53] he said and so when a man lives by faith
[1:45:55] and walks by faith i mean substance
[1:45:58] faith
[1:45:59] he is isolated from the entire world
[1:46:06] is he is he here
[1:46:09] is here
[1:46:13] isolated behind the veil you and christ
[1:46:16] alone
[1:46:19] that's what we're going to ready
[1:46:22] i'm following brother
[1:46:25] anything that i don't have lined up i
[1:46:26] want it lined up and if you don't if you
[1:46:29] try to spare me on anything brother i'm
[1:46:30] gonna hold it to you

[1:46:36] flay my heart inside and out i don't
[1:46:39] wanna have to walk away like this man
[1:46:47] that's real to me i've spent a lot of
[1:46:49] time pondering that guy
[1:46:54] where's his treasures at now
[1:46:57] who would you rather be moses
[1:47:01] or this man
[1:47:05] and moses walked away from everything he
[1:47:06] had
[1:47:09] he accounted the afflictions of the
[1:47:11] children of his greater treasures than
[1:47:13] all of egypt
[1:47:19] he's isolated from the entire world and
[1:47:21] becomes a new
[1:47:23] creature
[1:47:24] in christ
[1:47:26] now
[1:47:27] there now you're getting into bride

[1:59:27] i wouldn't want to rest on that why do
[1:59:30] you want to get in the presence of the
[1:59:31] holy ghost and then get out of the
[1:59:33] presence of the holy
[1:59:42] don't make no ghost
[1:59:48] all right
[1:59:50] i'm still trying to get to what i'm
[1:59:51] trying to get to
[1:59:52] the lord said this
[1:59:55] oh

[2:00:02] whatever he says there's not a shadow of
[2:00:04] a doubt nowhere

[2:00:10] out of it you go right on the same
[2:00:13] you're now you're coming into perfect
[2:00:15] faith
[2:00:16] perfect faith that cannot fail
[2:00:19] that faith never fails yes
[2:00:22] he was a mystic to them with his perfect
[2:00:25] faith and so is it now with those who
[2:00:28] have perfect faith are a mystic to
[2:00:31] others
[2:00:33] let me do this real quick and then we're
[2:00:35] going to be done
[2:00:38] and now this is out of crisis the
[2:00:39] mystery god revealed
[2:00:42] he said and now christ is in the church
[2:00:46] now the christ in the church is just
[2:00:50] being made known
[2:00:52] the whole thing is the revelation of god
[2:00:56] to take eve back
[2:00:58] to her
[2:01:00] right position again with her husband
[2:01:03] notice
[2:01:04] god is the husband
[2:01:07] of the church
[2:01:09] and the church is his pride
[2:01:12] now peter when he called this said thou
[2:01:15] art the christ the son of the living god
[2:01:18] now watch blessed are thou simon bar
[2:01:20] jonas means son of jonah
[2:01:22] blessed art thou for flesh and blood has
[2:01:24] not revealed this unto you
[2:01:27] you've never learned it from school
[2:01:29] my father which is in heaven revealed it
[2:01:33] unto you
[2:01:35] and if you want to know what your
[2:01:36] purpose is
[2:01:37] there's only one person can reveal it to
[2:01:39] you
[2:01:40] and that's your father that's in heaven
[2:01:43] not your mommy not your daddy not your
[2:01:46] pastor not your deacon not your husband
[2:01:49] not your wife
[2:01:51] i believe every wife needs a prayer life
[2:01:56] i believe every husband needs a prayer
[2:01:58] life
[2:02:00] is the wife supposed to be subject to
[2:02:01] her husband
[2:02:02] yes
[2:02:04] but if she's in the will of god and he's
[2:02:07] in the will of god they'll be such a
[2:02:10] harmony
[2:02:11] you won't know which one is which
[2:02:14] because it wasn't so brother stephen
[2:02:16] from the beginning
[2:02:18] that was put on there because of the
[2:02:19] curse
[2:02:20] the man was made to rule over the woman
[2:02:23] but before so if we're all in harmony
[2:02:25] with the holy spirit that won't even be
[2:02:28] like
[2:02:29] i'd be like the other day i was riding
[2:02:30] down the road and i'm doing 50 miles an
[2:02:32] hour and theresa says oh sam the
[2:02:35] policeman
[2:02:38] i said yeah
[2:02:40] i said i'm doing 55.
[2:02:43] that policeman don't mean nothing to me
[2:02:46] and when we get in the spirit
[2:02:50] these things that used to rub us
[2:02:53] won't rub us no more
[2:02:55] we will know that they were put there
[2:02:57] for a purpose
[2:03:00] and it was put there for our good
[2:03:03] and sometimes we had to follow it
[2:03:05] legally because it said so
[2:03:11] i'm going to help mommies out now
[2:03:13] i'm gonna help mommy's out
[2:03:15] okay you children
[2:03:17] when mommy says because i said so
[2:03:20] she's not being mean
[2:03:22] she don't have time to explain herself
[2:03:23] to you
[2:03:24] so just do it because she said so that's
[2:03:27] all
[2:03:28] do it
[2:03:30] i don't know if you all picked up on
[2:03:31] that
[2:03:32] but when he said legalistically just do
[2:03:35] it
[2:03:36] that's all
[2:03:38] if you don't understand it just do it
[2:03:41] do you believe god knows what he's doing
[2:03:45] i can't make a good sam i don't want to
[2:03:47] try to be a good god
[2:03:50] i gotta yield everything i am to god
[2:03:58] that was free of charge mom
[2:04:03] i hope somebody got it
[2:04:06] it might help one mommy out anyways
[2:04:12] my father which in heaven has revealed a
[2:04:14] notice upon this rock
[2:04:17] and we know that rock is the revelation
[2:04:20] of who he is
[2:04:21] and the gates of hell will not now look
[2:04:24] i'm going to skip down to paragraph 233
[2:04:28] look
[2:04:30] christ in you everybody say christ in me
[2:04:35] makes him the center
[2:04:38] of life
[2:04:40] of the revelation

[2:04:45] can i repeat that brother brown says
[2:04:47] brother brahm says can i repeat it
[2:04:49] brother brown's going to repeat it
[2:04:52] see
[2:04:53] he heard that that that didn't quite hit
[2:04:55] right so he's gonna repeat it look what
[2:04:57] he says
[2:04:58] christ's
[2:05:00] life
[2:05:02] in you
[2:05:04] makes him the center of the revelation
[2:05:06] [Music]
[2:05:08] christ in the bible
[2:05:11] makes the bible the complete revelation
[2:05:15] of christ
[2:05:19] we ain't got the good one yet
[2:05:22] i'm gonna let that salivate a few
[2:05:23] minutes

[2:06:28] show bread so god's purpose for us is
[2:06:30] hidden in the show bread
[2:06:32] and when the angel of our age shines the
[2:06:34] light on the show bread and you do what
[2:06:37] he says you're gonna find the purpose

[2:08:38] there's two qualifications
[2:08:41] you love god
[2:08:43] and you're called
[2:08:45] do you know that
[2:08:46] do we know that
[2:08:48] do we know that
[2:08:52] what is the new birth then you say
[2:08:53] brother branham
[2:08:55] what is the new birth
[2:08:58] it is the revelation
[2:09:01] of jesus christ
[2:09:03] personally
[2:09:04] to you
[2:09:18] not you joined the church you shook a
[2:09:20] hand you done something different you
[2:09:21] set a creed you promised to live by a
[2:09:23] code of rules
[2:09:25] but christ
[2:09:26] the bible
[2:09:28] he is the word that was revealed to you
[2:09:34] amen
[2:09:35] oh don't let the lateness of the hour
[2:09:37] get you let that soak home he is the
[2:09:41] word that is revealed to you

[2:09:57] that is the revelation
[2:09:59] that the church
[2:10:01] is built on
[2:10:03] let's stand
[2:10:16] a minute
[2:10:19] i know a lot of stuff's been said and
[2:10:21] and it might have cut a little bit
[2:10:23] somebody and
[2:10:24] if i it i
[2:10:26] honest i don't want to hurt nobody but
[2:10:29] but i think about this rich young ruler
[2:10:32] i think about he was there in the
[2:10:34] presence
[2:10:38] of eternal life
[2:10:42] and instead of looking at what he was
[2:10:44] able to do
[2:10:47] and if he would have just turned around
[2:10:50] and said you know i can't do this
[2:10:52] but here's somebody that can help me
[2:10:56] and so with your heads bowed
[2:11:00] with your heads bowed
[2:11:02] every one of you know what battle you're
[2:11:03] struggling with
[2:11:06] and i want to tell you by the authority
[2:11:08] of the bible by the authority of god's
[2:11:11] word
[2:11:12] he said if you ask you shall receive
[2:11:17] and it's such a simple thing
[2:11:20] if he would have just turned and looked
[2:11:21] at jesus and said jesus that's a hard
[2:11:24] thing for me
[2:11:25] can you help me
[2:11:29] i believe with all my heart it would be
[2:11:31] a different story
[2:11:36] we're missing the value of what we have
[2:11:43] i asked jesus to come right now where
[2:11:46] you're at
[2:11:48] and reveal to you
[2:11:50] the value
[2:11:52] of what you have
[2:11:55] what you have in your hand
[2:11:58] this word this precious word
[2:12:02] that gets poured out every sunday
[2:12:06] that gets poured out
[2:12:08] every wednesday
[2:12:11] i don't know if i've ever heard a bad
[2:12:12] service in this church
[2:12:15] i've never had a service where somebody
[2:12:17] was just trying to spend time
[2:12:19] [Music]
[2:12:21] to pull in
[2:12:24] they're making the vision
[2:12:26] plain upon the tables
[2:12:29] so that we can see
[2:12:31] and we can run thereby
[2:12:36] oh now you hold whatever it is
[2:12:39] that you're struggling with
[2:12:42] in your heart
[2:12:43] [Music]
[2:12:46] and if you don't have any struggles
[2:12:48] think of somebody that is struggling
[2:12:53] and let's ask him
[2:12:55] to help us
[2:12:56] [Music]
[2:12:59] you pray your own little way

[2:13:18] that this isn't it
[2:13:20] i still got children
[2:13:22] [Music]
[2:13:23] i got children

[2:13:28] and they're wondering like sheep without
[2:13:31] a shepherd
[2:13:33] and i don't know what to do for him
[2:13:37] so i'm turning to you great shepherd

[2:14:03] keep the blood over jesus
[2:14:04] [Music]
[2:14:06] please keep the blood over him
[2:14:09] lord send the holy ghost out after him
[2:14:13] that prophet said no matter how wayward
[2:14:15] your children are
[2:14:16] [Music]
[2:14:18] said you have the same faith
[2:14:20] [Music]
[2:14:21] for your children that you have for your
[2:14:23] own salvation
[2:14:27] whatever burden you have saints he's
[2:14:29] here to take it from you
[2:14:31] he said cast all your cares
[2:14:34] on me
[2:14:36] that's your anxieties
[2:14:38] your fears your complexes
[2:14:41] things you can't handle
[2:14:44] he said cast all your cares on me
[2:14:47] because i care for you
[2:14:53] [Music]
[2:14:55] to
[2:14:56] keep that
[2:14:59] which i've committed
[2:15:02] [Music]
[2:15:04] unto him
[2:15:09] [Music]
[2:15:18] [Music]
[2:15:21] and i'm persuaded
[2:15:25] that he
[2:15:27] if anybody has need of a prayer and you
[2:15:29] want to come up for prayer while the
[2:15:30] anointing is here
[2:15:32] feel free to come up
[2:15:34] which i've committed
[2:15:38] unto him
[2:15:41] against
[2:15:42] [Music]
[2:15:51] i am
[2:16:00] [Music]
[2:16:19] hallelujah
[2:16:21] amen
[2:16:25] hallelujah i mean enjoy the service
[2:16:27] tonight
[2:16:29] [Music]
[2:16:36] there is several points that brother sam
[2:16:39] preach on it
[2:16:41] that confirmed me exactly the sermon on
[2:16:43] sunday
[2:16:46] even the scripture and the thing he's
[2:16:48] saying is
[2:16:49] zeroed in exactly
[2:16:52] on it even one quote that we read
[2:16:56] amen
[2:16:57] it's a very difficult message for me to
[2:17:00] separate without getting into marriage
[2:17:04] and it's in the sabbath
[2:17:06] but i can't it's hard for me to stay on
[2:17:09] the sabbath without getting in the
[2:17:10] marriage and i keep seeing how the holy
[2:17:12] spirit is pulling the marriage part and
[2:17:16] pulling ephesians 5 which i was reading
[2:17:18] today at work
[2:17:19] i was meditating on ephesians 5.
[2:17:22] so you pray for me for the weekend
[2:17:26] and you take some good sleep
[2:17:29] to make sure you don't sleep in church
[2:17:32] amen
[2:17:34] i don't know what people say to be hard
[2:17:38] or to be
[2:17:40] cut so hard i don't think so
[2:17:43] when we avoid doing exactly what we are
[2:17:46] supposed to do that's when people get in
[2:17:48] trouble
[2:17:49] amen
[2:17:51] i was taught
[2:17:53] in school that when you're dealing with
[2:17:55] a child you need to tell them be careful
[2:17:58] be nice just
[2:17:59] try to cover
[2:18:01] the needle
[2:18:04] amen
[2:18:05] so when you see a child coming up on the
[2:18:07] chair the first question am i going to
[2:18:09] get a shot and you need to tell them
[2:18:11] well
[2:18:12] we're going to put your teeth to sleep
[2:18:14] and things like that
[2:18:16] and i keep watching that the kids keep
[2:18:18] getting nervous
[2:18:20] and it doesn't work
[2:18:23] so when i got in a child look at me say
[2:18:26] am i get a shot i say yes
[2:18:31] the mother was expecting me to say no
[2:18:34] i say yes the mother turned around he
[2:18:37] said at least you honest
[2:18:42] [Laughter]
[2:18:43] do you see what i'm saying
[2:18:46] then i turn around and the boy look at
[2:18:48] me he say what is going on what is this
[2:18:50] i say do you want me to show you the
[2:18:52] shot
[2:18:53] because that boy was so nervous for one
[2:18:57] week he kept talking about his
[2:18:59] appointment at home
[2:19:01] because he was so nervous and even my
[2:19:04] staff got nervous they said do you think
[2:19:06] you're going to be able to treat that
[2:19:07] boy do you think you're going to be able
[2:19:08] to treat the boy and i understood the
[2:19:10] staff is already nervous in other words
[2:19:12] they're telling me can you refer him i
[2:19:14] can i can feel that i knew referring
[2:19:16] must say no problem i won't worry about
[2:19:18] it the first thing i get there he said
[2:19:20] can i am i going to get a shot and say
[2:19:22] yes
[2:19:24] he turned around i said do you want to
[2:19:25] see the shot he said yes i pulled the
[2:19:28] whole needle i gave it to him
[2:19:30] i said go ahead and take it a big needle
[2:19:32] hey look he said that's the door i said
[2:19:35] that's exactly the needle i said do you
[2:19:36] have other questions he said what is
[2:19:38] that i just pulled it i say come hold it
[2:19:40] i said this is the drill
[2:19:42] he said what does he do i said look
[2:19:44] right here i just pray that water came
[2:19:46] out i pulled a burr i put it in i said
[2:19:48] hold it
[2:19:50] what else this said
[2:19:52] what is this what does he do i explained
[2:19:54] him i'm always sitting right there
[2:19:56] and i took like 10 minutes and after i
[2:19:58] finished i said now are you ready for
[2:19:59] the needle
[2:20:00] you say yes i say open your mouth
[2:20:05] and i numb him here i know him right
[2:20:07] there and i give him even the hardest
[2:20:10] shot and he took it
[2:20:16] i even tried to hold off on the
[2:20:17] treatment and say you already know you
[2:20:19] wait for next time you say no i want to
[2:20:21] finish everything today
[2:20:24] why because you're telling the truth
[2:20:28] amen when you tell the truth
[2:20:32] the more sin is increasing
[2:20:36] in this
[2:20:37] world
[2:20:38] the more they don't want you to speak
[2:20:40] against sin
[2:20:41] and they call that to be rude
[2:20:44] so preacher has been called rude
[2:20:47] because they're preaching against
[2:20:49] homosexuality you rude you're not
[2:20:51] supposed to say things like that it is
[2:20:53] not being rude it is speaking the word
[2:20:55] of god and the word of god is truth
[2:20:59] amen
[2:21:00] so when you need to speak you speak
[2:21:02] straight what is in your mind
[2:21:09] you don't have a lot of trouble to think
[2:21:11] which word should i use on the pulpit
[2:21:14] that's too much i'm reading the bible
[2:21:16] i'm reading brother branham how can i
[2:21:18] take that word and quote it again
[2:21:20] the one who called it the word was the
[2:21:22] devil
[2:21:23] that's what brother branham say so when
[2:21:25] you speak speak your mind straight
[2:21:29] and brother branham say when you are you
[2:21:32] the people will
[2:21:33] learn how to live with you kill you
[2:21:36] so i don't have to struggle a lot i
[2:21:38] speak my mind and i go to sleep you're
[2:21:40] going to be speaking your mind and then
[2:21:42] you go back you say did he really get
[2:21:44] what i was saying you're the one
[2:21:46] struggling i didn't because mine was
[2:21:48] clear
[2:21:49] yours is difficult because they have to
[2:21:51] figure it out what was he trying was he
[2:21:53] really upset or not i don't understand
[2:21:55] maybe or maybe that was just maybe maybe
[2:21:57] because you don't you go in too many
[2:22:00] corners amen so brother sam that was
[2:22:03] pure and that was clear and that's the
[2:22:05] way it's supposed to come out
[2:22:09] [Applause]
[2:22:10] amen
[2:22:12] blessed be the name of the lord do you
[2:22:14] know how many
[2:22:15] furniture are in the temple in the
[2:22:17] tabernacle

[2:23:20] need of a candlestick over to the
[2:23:23] showbread table you can never over
[2:23:25] emphasize that amen it is the messenger
[2:23:28] shining the light on the bread and when
[2:23:31] the bread is illuminating it becomes the
[2:23:34] light of the hour that is god's purpose
[2:23:36] for your time
[2:23:39] if you want to know what god is doing in
[2:23:41] this day you got to find the messenger
[2:23:43] of this day and see what he preached

[2:23:46] that is the purpose of god for you if
[2:23:49] you follow that message you are under
[2:23:51] god's purpose for the time because
[2:23:53] that's what god wants to accomplish in
[2:23:56] that specific time is it complicated
[2:24:01] amen
[2:24:02] is it complicated
[2:24:04] no and remember the showbread missed
[2:24:07] half right
[2:24:08] because the other half was on the other
[2:24:10] side
[2:24:12] amen
[2:24:13] but remember remember pray for me and
[2:24:17] stay in prayer for the weekend so that
[2:24:20] the lord will help us amen it will help

[2:24:42] it's going to be hard for you to believe
[2:24:44] it to be true
[2:24:46] but it's true
[2:24:47] because the devil doesn't want you to
[2:24:49] believe like that
[2:24:50] amen and you will look at women again
[2:24:53] differently
[2:24:56] then you used to look at sisters
[2:24:58] differently

[2:27:08] have you ever thought about it
[2:27:11] have you thought about it brother
[2:27:13] branham said you not have righteous in
[2:27:14] faith

[2:27:46] by faith enoch was translated that he
[2:27:49] should not see death
[2:27:51] and was not found

[2:28:04] he please god watch the next verse how
