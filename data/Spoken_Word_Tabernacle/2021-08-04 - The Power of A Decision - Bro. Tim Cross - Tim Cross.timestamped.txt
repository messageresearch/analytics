[5:29] y'all may be seated as they gather the

[5:33] i have a couple more songs here i'm
[5:35] going to do but i don't know if anybody
[5:36] has a special on their heart this
[5:37] evening
[5:39] if anybody has a special i didn't
[5:40] receive anything written on on paper
[5:43] but if anybody has a very special
[5:46] caleb all right we got caleb and while
[5:49] he's making his way up i i just wanted
[5:52] to give a quick testimony
[5:54] last wednesday or a couple a couple
[5:56] services ago was about over a month ago
[5:58] probably i
[6:00] went to our pastor and i told him i said
[6:02] i usually don't go to my pastor and ask
[6:04] him to
[6:05] pray with me about anything because i
[6:07] know he's got enough on his plate and i
[6:08] don't want to add to it but
[6:10] i told him that i had a really strong
[6:12] desire for something that i felt the
[6:14] lord
[6:15] said was mine and and it didn't look
[6:17] like it was possible and i told him i
[6:19] said if you could just pray with me
[6:20] about this because
[6:21] it's something that i really want and uh
[6:25] you know i believe it's mine and i just
[6:27] i don't know how i'm gonna get it but
[6:29] i believe that the thor can do great
[6:31] things so what it is it was it was a
[6:33] deal and it was under contract
[6:35] and uh like a real estate deal that was
[6:37] under contract by somebody else and
[6:39] and i was like i know the lord can move
[6:41] and i spoke to the lady and said if this
[6:43] person breaks this contract at all
[6:44] please come to me first and
[6:46] and whatever it takes and so about a
[6:49] month went by and i was talking to
[6:51] shango last wednesday
[6:53] and he uh he asked me i didn't say
[6:55] nothing about it but he just asked me he
[6:57] said
[6:57] did you get that deal yet and i was like
[7:00] no
[7:00] i i didn't forget about it but i kind of
[7:04] put it over to the side because it was
[7:05] under contract there's nothing that can
[7:06] be done
[7:07] and the lady got tired of me bugging her
[7:09] and said i'll get back to you if it
[7:10] comes open
[7:12] leave me alone so i was like i better
[7:14] leave her alone
[7:15] so when shingo brought that up i kind of
[7:18] it was kind of in the back part of my
[7:19] mind but i wasn't thinking too much
[7:20] about it well it was
[7:22] two days ago that the lady reached out
[7:25] to me
[7:25] and said that it's open if you're still
[7:28] interested
[7:29] and i'm willing to take offers and i got
[7:32] a partner we made some offers and it
[7:34] looks like we're going to be going under
[7:35] contract on it in a couple of days
[7:37] and i asked her i said what happened to
[7:39] the other buyer and she said
[7:41] he just just disappeared i was like he
[7:44] just disappeared and she's like yeah i
[7:46] haven't heard from him and
[7:47] the date on the contract went expired
[7:50] and he didn't say nothing to me so
[7:52] she's like i know you want it and you
[7:54] know i just feel like i should give it
[7:56] to you
[7:56] and as long as you know you can get an
[7:59] offer that works then we'll do that and
[8:00] i was like that's the lord
[8:02] that's the lord it was mine god knew it
[8:05] was mine and he just provided a way and
[8:06] i'm so grateful for it
[8:10] but where did caleb go there he is caleb
[8:12] come up
[8:17] [Music]
[8:20] god bless your sins i mean before i
[8:23] sing i just have a little testimony i
[8:24] want to give up for the group of the
[8:25] lord
[8:26] um yesterday i went to get a haircut
[8:29] with
[8:30] brother mike and i for the wedding down
[8:32] in columbia and on our way back
[8:35] there was a car beside us basically
[8:38] the wheel was already messed up the tire
[8:40] was already messed up and uh
[8:42] we're driving and we've seen it it was
[8:44] kind of shifting on the road
[8:45] and um i saw her first and then so but
[8:49] i'm like you know something's wrong with
[8:50] that driver but it was the car
[8:51] not the driver and then as we were
[8:54] passing
[8:54] the other corner on the right side i
[8:57] guess the tire just
[8:58] bust out the the time the drone got
[9:00] separated
[9:02] and he almost hit us by just me such a
[9:05] small inch he missed us so i just want
[9:08] to thank the lord for that it could have
[9:09] been a terrible accident
[9:11] but the handle was there for us and also
[9:23] um it's been over a year since the lord
[9:26] has brought me
[9:27] to this church i didn't want to say that
[9:30] i joined the church because i was born
[9:32] in the family of the god so you don't
[9:34] join a church you're born in a church
[9:36] amen so i just want to thank the lord
[9:38] for everything that has happened
[9:40] in this hotel his presence the word um
[9:43] it's been a blessing to me
[9:45] and just be able to you know do
[9:47] something for the lord in the service of
[9:48] the lord in the house

[9:52] unspeakable joy to me

[41:01] the holy spirit convict their heart
[41:04] in jesus name we ask it amen
[41:07] amen joshua chapter 24.
[41:10] it's a little bit lengthy of reading but
[41:12] i i believe it'll be fine
[41:14] verse 1 and joshua called all the tribes
[41:17] of israel to shechem
[41:19] and called for the elders of israel and
[41:21] for their heads
[41:22] for their judges and for their officers
[41:25] and they presented themselves before god
[41:28] and joshua said unto all the people thus
[41:31] saith the lord god of israel
[41:33] your fathers dwelt on the other side of
[41:35] the flood in
[41:36] old time even terror the father of
[41:39] abraham
[41:40] and the father of nacor and they served
[41:42] other gods
[41:44] and i took your father abraham from the
[41:46] other side of the flood
[41:48] and led him throughout all the land of
[41:50] caden and multiplied his seed
[41:52] and gave him isaac and i gave unto isaac
[41:55] jacob and esau
[41:56] and i gave them to esau mount seir to
[41:59] possess it but jacob and his children
[42:01] went down into egypt i sent moses
[42:05] also and aaron and i plagued egypt
[42:08] according to that which i did among them
[42:11] and afterward
[42:12] i brought you out and i brought your
[42:16] fathers out of egypt and ye came unto
[42:18] the sea
[42:19] and the egyptians pursued after your
[42:21] fathers with chariots and horsemen unto
[42:24] the red sea
[42:25] and when they cried unto the lord he put
[42:27] darkness between you
[42:29] and the egyptians and brought the sea
[42:31] upon them
[42:32] and covered them and your eyes have seen
[42:36] what i have done in egypt and ye dwelt
[42:38] in the wilderness a long season
[42:40] and i brought you into the land of the
[42:42] amorites which dwelt on the other side
[42:45] jordan
[42:45] and they fought with you and i gave them
[42:48] into your hand
[42:49] that ye might possess their land and i
[42:52] destroyed them
[42:53] be from before you then balak the son of
[42:56] zipper king of moab arose
[42:58] and ward against israel and sit and
[43:01] called
[43:01] balaam the son of beor to curse you but
[43:04] i would not hearken unto balaam
[43:06] therefore he blessed you still so i
[43:08] delivered you out of his head
[43:10] and you went over jordan and came into
[43:12] jericho and the men of jericho fought
[43:14] against you
[43:15] the amorites and the perizzites and the
[43:18] canaanites and the hittites
[43:20] and the gergescites the haibites and the
[43:22] jebusites
[43:23] and i delivered them into your head
[43:26] it doesn't matter who's fighting against
[43:28] you tonight
[43:30] who's fighting for you
[43:34] that's where the key lies amen oh praise
[43:37] the lord
[43:38] and i sent the hornet before you which
[43:40] drave them out from before you even the
[43:42] two kings of the amorites
[43:44] but not with thy sword nor with
[43:47] thy bow but and i have given you
[43:51] a land for which ye did not labor and
[43:54] cities which ye built not and
[43:58] ye dwell in them of the vineyards and
[44:00] olives yards which he planted not
[44:03] do you eat now therefore
[44:06] fear the lord and serve him
[44:10] in sincerity and in truth
[44:14] and put away the gods which your father
[44:18] served on the other side of the flood
[44:20] and in egypt and serve the lord and if
[44:23] it seems
[44:24] evil unto you to serve the lord choose
[44:26] you this day
[44:27] whom ye will serve whether the gods
[44:30] which your father served that were on
[44:32] the other side of the flood
[44:33] or the gods of the amorites in whose
[44:35] land he dwell
[44:37] but as for me and my house
[44:41] we will serve the lord
[44:45] amen may the lord bless his word tonight
[44:48] as you're seated
[44:50] amen i'm going to speak tonight on the
[44:52] power
[44:53] of a decision amen because i i believe
[44:58] i believe this was a showdown amen a
[45:02] joshua
[45:02] ministry calls the children of god to a
[45:06] showdown
[45:07] amen it's it's no long there's no two
[45:10] ways about this
[45:11] there's no three ways or amen there's
[45:14] either
[45:15] either god has done this or god hasn't
[45:17] done it
[45:18] and if god has done it we need to serve
[45:21] him and put away all the other gods
[45:23] amen you know it's hard for us to
[45:25] imagine how a people
[45:27] who have just experienced everything
[45:30] these people have experienced
[45:32] remember only uh only months before this
[45:36] they were slaves in egypt and had been
[45:39] there
[45:40] for 400 years serving as slaves they
[45:43] they had lost their identity they had
[45:45] lost their heritage
[45:47] amen everything they had was given to
[45:49] them by egyptians
[45:50] their all their entire life and their
[45:53] decisions
[45:54] was controlled by egyptians amen but one
[45:56] day god remembered his promise
[45:59] amen and he came down in the form of a
[46:01] prophetic ministry
[46:02] because he said i am come to hell
[46:05] and then when he spoke to moses in the
[46:07] pillar of fire brother garcia he said i
[46:10] am come down to deliver my people
[46:13] yes he used a man yes he used a prophet
[46:16] but it was god amen to egypt he was just
[46:20] a man
[46:20] to egypt he was just a failure but to
[46:23] the children of the promise
[46:24] that ministry was god's way of
[46:27] manifesting his promise through their
[46:29] father abraham
[46:30] amen so he plagued egypt with plagues he
[46:33] turned the water into blood
[46:35] amen he brought flies and fleas and lice
[46:38] and
[46:39] all of these things darkness in the land
[46:41] and then the death angel moved through
[46:42] the streets
[46:43] and those who believed the prophet's
[46:45] message and applied it to their homes
[46:47] into their lives
[46:48] amen marched out of egypt amen and
[46:50] pharaoh pursued them to the red sea
[46:52] oh man they stood on the banks of the
[46:54] red sea between two mountains
[46:56] with the greatest army of the greatest
[46:58] nation in the world at that time
[47:00] pursuing them from behind amen and when
[47:03] they cried out unto moses
[47:04] moses cried unto god and god said why
[47:07] cry
[47:08] speak and move forward god divided the
[47:10] waters
[47:11] they marched across the dry land and
[47:13] when the egyptians
[47:14] tried to duplicate it amen and try to
[47:17] imitate it
[47:18] god destroyed them in the same waters
[47:22] that the children of israel had just
[47:23] walked through
[47:24] [Music]
[47:25] oh my god told them the egyptians that
[47:28] you see this day
[47:29] you shall see them no more oh my god
[47:33] could have left those egypt
[47:34] egyptians back there at home licking
[47:36] their wounds
[47:38] he could have left pharaoh back there in
[47:39] his palace
[47:41] he could have left the soldiers back
[47:42] there to regroup and reassemble their
[47:44] military
[47:45] and figure out how they were going to
[47:46] move on with their lives
[47:48] but he didn't he let pharaoh pursue them
[47:51] he let the armies pursue them
[47:53] he let the same task masters amen that
[47:56] had whipped them
[47:57] and beaten him and made their decisions
[47:59] for them
[48:00] and controlled their lives every day of
[48:02] their life he let those same taskmasters
[48:05] get on the other side of the banks of
[48:07] the red sea
[48:08] so every one of his children could watch
[48:11] the one who used to control them
[48:13] and used to drive their life and used to
[48:16] torment them
[48:17] and used to aggravate him and used to
[48:19] afflict them
[48:20] they could have the personal pleasure of
[48:22] watching god drown
[48:24] that demon in the red sea for the final
[48:27] time
[48:28] hallelujah i'll tell you tonight you
[48:31] don't have to accept any compromises
[48:33] with satan
[48:34] amen god can drown your egyptian too
[48:37] amen whatever you've been
[48:38] dealing with whatever you've been
[48:40] tempted by whatever you've been fighting
[48:42] with amen
[48:43] if you just march up the banks of the
[48:44] red sea hey man watch
[48:46] god roll the waters back even and drown
[48:48] that thing that's been tormenting you
[48:52] amen he was a cloud by day
[48:55] and a fire by night he was manna from
[48:58] heaven
[48:59] and water from the rock even their
[49:01] clothes didn't grow threadbare
[49:03] even their shoes didn't wear out amen
[49:06] they were given even the elderly and the
[49:08] old
[49:08] amen had strength in their bones
[49:10] hallelujah to make the journey to the
[49:12] promised land
[49:14] and yet they come all the way on the
[49:16] other side of jordan
[49:17] and they still have gods
[49:24] amen now there's not a one of us that
[49:28] would have walked in here tonight with
[49:29] an idol hanging around her neck
[49:32] amen i sure hope not amen we wouldn't
[49:35] have something at home a candle we burn
[49:37] or
[49:38] some relative that we prayed to or some
[49:40] deceased loved one amen
[49:42] no we would never do that amen but what
[49:45] is
[49:45] what is a false god amen what is a
[49:49] little g
[49:50] g.o.d amen it's
[49:53] something that you fall back on
[49:56] just in case god doesn't
[49:59] take care of it oh
[50:03] my amen and as far as that goes
[50:07] we got a lot of things that if we're not
[50:09] careful
[50:10] can turn into gods oh brother tim i'm
[50:13] praying for my healing
[50:15] but i'm i'll tell you i found this
[50:16] doctor or i found this diet
[50:19] or i found this a recipe amen oh i found
[50:22] this and i found that be careful
[50:24] that that doesn't become a little god to
[50:26] you
[50:27] amen i thank god for doctors i thank god
[50:30] for medicine and i thank god for science
[50:32] but i also thank god that i know who god
[50:34] is
[50:35] and i know where my healing comes from
[50:38] and if he sends me to a doctor
[50:40] or a hospital i'm gonna go and if the
[50:42] doctor gives me a prescription
[50:44] i'm gonna take it even but when i'm well
[50:46] when i'm healed
[50:48] when i'm restored again i'm gonna give
[50:50] one person the credit
[50:52] because i know where healing comes from
[50:55] i know who walked up golgotha's hill
[50:57] and bled on an old rugged cross for my
[51:00] salvation
[51:00] no doctor died for me no hospital rose
[51:04] for me
[51:04] amen i know who god is amen
[51:08] and i don't want a false god in my life
[51:09] tonight
[51:11] but joshua wasn't bringing them
[51:14] to a confession but he was bringing them
[51:18] to a consecration
[51:20] amen he wasn't questioning their
[51:22] heritage
[51:23] he wasn't he wasn't there to question
[51:25] whether or not they believed the message
[51:27] whether moses was their prophet or
[51:30] abraham
[51:30] was their father amen he was there to
[51:33] say
[51:34] is the message you're everything
[51:37] amen is the prophet you're everything
[51:40] it's all your faith
[51:42] is your entire life wrapped up in the
[51:44] revealed word of the hour
[51:46] have you forsaken every other way he
[51:49] said yes
[51:50] this is tradition yes your fathers did
[51:52] this but it's time for the tradition to
[51:54] drown
[51:55] [Applause]
[51:56] it's time for the family history to
[51:58] drown
[52:00] it's time for what happened in your old
[52:02] church
[52:03] to drown oh my
[52:06] it's time for everything that has
[52:09] hindered you
[52:10] from possessing the canaan land and
[52:13] occupying it
[52:14] and dispossessing every canaanite and
[52:17] every enemy it's time for that to die
[52:20] amen you're following the right thing
[52:25] you're in the right movement but you've
[52:28] got to be
[52:28] holy and fully
[52:31] in order for your faith to be an
[52:33] overcoming faith
[52:35] in order for you to take full possession
[52:38] and to conquer
[52:39] every canaanite you've got to be
[52:41] committed
[52:43] the pastor can't do it the prophet can't
[52:46] do it
[52:46] your parents can't do it you've got to
[52:49] do it
[52:51] jesus said in mark 8 34 and when he had
[52:55] called the people unto him with his
[52:56] disciples also
[52:58] he said unto them whosoever will come
[52:59] after me
[53:01] let him deny himself
[53:05] and take up his cross and follow me
[53:08] for whosoever will save his life shall
[53:11] lose it
[53:12] but whosoever shall lose his life for my
[53:15] sake and for the gospels
[53:17] the same shall save it for what shall it
[53:20] profit a man if he shall gain the whole
[53:21] world
[53:23] and lose his soul
[53:27] amen it doesn't matter what you gain in
[53:30] this life
[53:30] don't do it at the expense
[53:34] of your soul amen
[53:39] amen if you have to keep your family out
[53:42] of church
[53:43] to add another digit to your salary
[53:49] it doesn't matter how much you gain it

[55:25] of him also shall the son of man be
[55:28] ashamed
[55:29] when he cometh into the glory of his
[55:31] father with the holy angels
[55:35] the decision is yours
[55:38] god has given each of us the power of
[55:40] choice
[55:42] every one of us tonight has choice
[55:47] amen the reason the world is in the
[55:49] condition it's in today
[55:51] is because of a choice amen
[55:54] because a woman chose to listen
[55:58] to another voice and because adam
[56:01] entered into the transgression
[56:03] with her and made the choice he did amen
[56:07] the world is in the condition it's in
[56:08] today
[56:10] but we're in the condition we're in as
[56:12] sons and daughters of god
[56:14] because another man made a choice oh
[56:17] father if it be thy will
[56:20] let this cup pass from me oh
[56:23] my but not my will but thine be done
[56:28] and that choice amen over
[56:31] it reversed the choice of the first adam
[56:34] amen the choice of the second adam undid
[56:38] all of the wrong of the wrong choice of
[56:40] the first adam
[56:41] i'm so thankful the second adam amen the
[56:43] first adam made a choice that affects me
[56:47] the first adam made a choice that
[56:49] affects the entire world
[56:51] but the second adam made a choice too
[56:53] that affects
[56:54] it impacts every believer every son and
[56:57] daughter of god tonight
[56:58] amen
[57:00] [Music]
[57:03] you can believe tonight you can choose
[57:07] to believe
[57:08] that your life is entirely the result
[57:12] of other people's choices
[57:16] you can choose to believe that oh
[57:19] brother tim
[57:20] if you only knew my story if you only
[57:24] knew the way i was raised
[57:26] and what my family what my parents what
[57:29] you know
[57:30] what this person that person if you only
[57:33] knew
[57:35] see you can choose to believe that your
[57:38] life
[57:39] is entirely the result of other people's
[57:42] choices
[57:43] but really and truly
[57:46] it's your choosing
[57:50] that determines the outcome
[57:53] of your life there are things in life
[57:56] that you can't
[57:57] control and there are things in life
[58:00] that can happen to you
[58:02] that are are beyond your ability to
[58:04] choose otherwise
[58:05] but how you react to it
[58:08] how you respond to it is
[58:11] your choice and your choice alone
[58:15] the bible says in genesis 45 verse 4 and
[58:18] joseph said unto his brethren
[58:21] come near to me i pray you and they came
[58:24] near
[58:25] and he said i am joseph your brother
[58:29] whom ye sold ye
[58:32] sold into egypt he is meeting his
[58:36] brothers for the first time to reveal
[58:39] himself to them
[58:41] after they sold him into slavery decades
[58:44] before this
[58:47] left him to die first in the pit
[58:50] and then sold him as a slave to
[58:52] strangers
[58:54] and told told their father that he had
[58:56] been killed
[58:58] to a bad for to cause their father to
[59:01] abandon any hopes of ever seeing him
[59:03] again
[59:04] they had a purpose so he says i am
[59:07] joseph
[59:08] your brother whom ye sold
[59:12] into egypt now therefore
[59:15] be not grieved nor angry with yourselves
[59:20] that you sold me hither i want you to
[59:23] listen to how many times he says
[59:26] one time he says ye sold
[59:29] then he says for god did
[59:33] listen to how many times he says for god
[59:35] did send me before you
[59:36] to preserve life for these two years
[59:39] hath the famine been in the land and yet
[59:41] there are five years into which there
[59:42] shall be neither hearing
[59:43] or harvest and god sent me
[59:47] before you to preserve your posterity in
[59:50] the earth and now to save your lives
[59:53] by a great deliverance so now it was not
[59:56] you that sent me hither
[1:00:00] but god and
[1:00:03] he hath made me a father to pharaoh
[1:00:07] and lord of all his house and a ruler
[1:00:11] throughout all the land of egypt
[1:00:15] haste ye and go up to my father and say
[1:00:17] unto him
[1:00:18] thus saith thy son joseph god
[1:00:21] hath made me lord of all
[1:00:25] egypt come down unto me tarry knot
[1:00:30] so only one time and he doesn't do it to
[1:00:33] accuse them
[1:00:35] he doesn't do it to shame them he
[1:00:38] doesn't do it to
[1:00:39] to place guilt on their conscience
[1:00:42] he does it strictly for the purpose of
[1:00:45] identifying himself to them
[1:00:48] i am the same person
[1:00:51] that you left to die i am the same
[1:00:55] person
[1:00:56] that you put in the pit and then brought
[1:00:59] me up
[1:01:00] and saw me as a slave however you saw me
[1:01:04] then
[1:01:05] look at me now because i'm the same
[1:01:08] person
[1:01:09] that's the only reason he gave them any
[1:01:12] credits
[1:01:14] for what had happened to him the only
[1:01:17] reason he said anything about what they
[1:01:19] did to him
[1:01:19] is so they could understand he was the
[1:01:21] same person
[1:01:23] and then he said god said god did
[1:01:26] god did god placed me here god placed me
[1:01:30] there
[1:01:30] god made me this god made me you made me
[1:01:33] a slave
[1:01:35] you made me a slave but god made me a
[1:01:38] ruler
[1:01:39] god made me father over pharaoh's house
[1:01:42] a lord over egypt
[1:01:43] regardless of what you did i don't give
[1:01:46] you credit for any of it
[1:01:47] i give god all the praise
[1:01:52] that is the choice of an overcomer
[1:01:56] that is a choice of somebody who's on
[1:01:58] their way to the throne
[1:02:00] that says it doesn't matter what
[1:02:01] happened to me it doesn't matter what
[1:02:04] people thought
[1:02:05] it doesn't matter what people say it
[1:02:07] doesn't matter what people do
[1:02:09] everything that happens to me is
[1:02:12] controlled
[1:02:13] and permitted and ordained by the
[1:02:16] almighty god
[1:02:20] hallelujah
[1:02:25] oh he could have really had a time they
[1:02:28] were
[1:02:28] in the palm of his hand to do
[1:02:31] anything with them he could have thrown
[1:02:34] him in prison
[1:02:35] he could have had him executed he could
[1:02:37] have had him stripped naked
[1:02:39] and led through the streets and i wonder
[1:02:42] if it were up to us
[1:02:45] to meet out justice
[1:02:48] to the men and women who through our
[1:02:50] lives
[1:02:51] have shamed us humiliated us
[1:02:55] tormented us abused us
[1:03:00] what would your justice be to those
[1:03:03] people
[1:03:06] because in his choice
[1:03:09] he never mentions the jealousy
[1:03:15] the envy the lies
[1:03:19] the conspiracies the evil schemes
[1:03:24] joseph didn't write that in the bible
[1:03:26] about himself
[1:03:28] god wrote that that was written by
[1:03:31] someone else
[1:03:32] of the things because joseph was not
[1:03:35] focused on the negative
[1:03:39] [Laughter]
[1:03:42] that's a choice he chose
[1:03:45] i'm not going to focus on that i'm not
[1:03:47] going to place emphasis on that
[1:03:49] i'm not going to feel sorry for myself
[1:03:52] but those are real events in his life he
[1:03:55] was
[1:03:56] hated he was envied they were jealous of
[1:04:00] him
[1:04:00] they despised their own blood brother
[1:04:04] they put him there and from there he was
[1:04:06] treated like a slave
[1:04:07] he was sold and sold and bought and sold
[1:04:11] and finally he ends up in a pharaoh's
[1:04:13] court and then he's lied about
[1:04:15] he's falsely accused falsely imprisoned
[1:04:18] everything good that he did got turned
[1:04:20] into bad by somebody else
[1:04:23] but he doesn't mention a single word
[1:04:26] of it he said
[1:04:29] god did god did god did
[1:04:34] oh i would we would realize tonight that
[1:04:36] we were purchased by the blood of jesus
[1:04:38] christ and as sons and daughters of god
[1:04:42] we are his property we belong to him and
[1:04:45] our lives
[1:04:45] are completely in his hands and in his
[1:04:48] control
[1:04:51] amen somebody say amen tonight
[1:04:54] [Applause]
[1:04:56] he credited god for everything
[1:05:01] everything that unfolded in his life
[1:05:05] we are not victims
[1:05:08] we are victors
[1:05:12] amen we are not victims
[1:05:15] we are victors and we know
[1:05:19] that all things work together
[1:05:23] for the good of those that love the lord
[1:05:25] and are thee called
[1:05:27] unto his purpose we are
[1:05:30] more than conquerors
[1:05:33] through him that loved us
[1:05:38] everything everything
[1:05:41] that takes place in a christian's life
[1:05:45] serves to prove that satan
[1:05:49] is a defeated foe and no matter how he
[1:05:53] manifests
[1:05:54] himself he is the perpetual
[1:05:58] victim
[1:06:00] [Laughter]
[1:06:02] he is the victim
[1:06:06] satan is the victim of michael's
[1:06:09] overthrow in heaven
[1:06:11] and christ continued defeat of him
[1:06:15] in earth there he was overthrown by
[1:06:20] angels here he's being overthrown by
[1:06:22] sons and daughters of god
[1:06:25] amen i want to tell you tonight he is
[1:06:28] the victim of his
[1:06:29] own unbelief
[1:06:33] and i refuse to join him
[1:06:35] [Music]
[1:06:37] amen i refuse to listen to his libra the
[1:06:40] carlos
[1:06:41] i refuse for him to make me feel like
[1:06:44] i'm his partner
[1:06:47] i'm not a victim satan you're the victim
[1:06:51] [Applause]
[1:06:54] had i remained your subject had i
[1:06:57] remained your disciple
[1:06:59] had i remained in your prison i would
[1:07:01] too
[1:07:02] be a victim but jesus signed my pardon
[1:07:07] he bought me with a great price amen and
[1:07:10] because he overcame
[1:07:12] i have overcome and i refuse to identify
[1:07:15] with your victimism i'm a victor
[1:07:19] amen i'm a son and daughter of god
[1:07:21] [Music]
[1:07:23] amen praise the lord
[1:07:29] choice the prophet of god says in many
[1:07:32] things of life
[1:07:33] we are given a choice the way of life
[1:07:36] itself is a choice
[1:07:38] we have a right to make our own way
[1:07:40] choose our own way that we
[1:07:42] want to live how you spend your time is
[1:07:46] a choice
[1:07:48] and we got a lot of devices and
[1:07:51] inventions today
[1:07:53] amen to occupy our time
[1:07:57] and i wonder if some of these things
[1:07:59] haven't turned our minds
[1:08:01] and souls into garbage cans
[1:08:04] because we're feeling our minds and our
[1:08:08] memories and our time
[1:08:10] with news reports videos
[1:08:16] gossip facebook whatsapp
[1:08:19] instagram what er what is going on in
[1:08:22] everyone else's lives
[1:08:26] amen we need to turn to another well
[1:08:29] amen amen you don't have to bathe under
[1:08:33] a downspout of a gutter
[1:08:35] you can drink from a well amen
[1:08:40] education is a choice we can choose
[1:08:42] whether we're going to be educated
[1:08:44] or whether we're not going to be
[1:08:45] educated that's a choice right and wrong
[1:08:47] is a choice
[1:08:48] every man woman boy and girl has to
[1:08:51] choose
[1:08:52] whether they're going to try to live
[1:08:54] right or not live right it's a choice
[1:08:57] choice is a great thing your eternal
[1:09:00] destination is a choice
[1:09:02] and brother ben says maybe tonight some
[1:09:04] of you will make that choice
[1:09:06] of where you'll spend eternity before
[1:09:08] this service ends tonight
[1:09:11] there'll be one time that if you turn
[1:09:13] god down
[1:09:14] many time there'll be one time you'll
[1:09:16] turn them down the last time
[1:09:18] there is a line between mercy and
[1:09:20] judgment it's a dangerous thing
[1:09:23] for a man or a woman boy or girl to step
[1:09:26] across that line
[1:09:27] for when for there's no return when you
[1:09:30] step across that deadline
[1:09:32] so tonight it may be the time that many
[1:09:35] will make their decision
[1:09:36] where they will spend the endless
[1:09:38] eternity
[1:09:40] i just want to move into something here
[1:09:41] for a moment and i want to be conscious
[1:09:43] of the time but
[1:09:44] sometimes i believe god will let us
[1:09:47] drift along
[1:09:50] and even be partakers and witnesses
[1:09:53] like the children of israel were no one
[1:09:56] could deny
[1:09:58] the things they had experienced in their
[1:10:01] lives
[1:10:03] but now it was getting personal but much
[1:10:06] like the token
[1:10:07] there comes a time when it's not about
[1:10:10] your environment
[1:10:13] it's not about your family it's not
[1:10:16] about your history
[1:10:19] it's about where you are right now
[1:10:22] you're standing
[1:10:23] face to face with the revealed word of
[1:10:26] the hour
[1:10:27] and it's your time to choose
[1:10:30] amen when a showdown comes
[1:10:34] an ultimatum is given you can't sit on
[1:10:36] the fence any longer
[1:10:38] you can't be undecided any longer
[1:10:41] amen god became weary of israel's
[1:10:44] indifference one time
[1:10:45] and elijah called for a showdown you
[1:10:48] know elijah said there doesn't have to
[1:10:49] be any debates
[1:10:51] there doesn't have to be any if about
[1:10:53] this
[1:10:55] if let the god who's the true god answer
[1:10:57] by
[1:10:58] fire you know why worry and why fuss and
[1:11:01] why debate and
[1:11:02] and why i have all this controversy
[1:11:04] let's just settle the question
[1:11:07] let's settle the god likes to settle the
[1:11:09] question
[1:11:11] oh my and so he gave them the first
[1:11:13] opportunity and we know they cried and
[1:11:15] they screamed and they danced and they
[1:11:17] cut
[1:11:17] themselves and they did all these things
[1:11:19] and you know something it occurred to me
[1:11:21] brother stephen
[1:11:22] those people of all the gods
[1:11:25] that they had and that they called on
[1:11:28] they didn't care which one answered if
[1:11:32] even one of their gods had answered
[1:11:36] in any way they would have been thrilled
[1:11:38] to death
[1:11:41] they just they would have been happy
[1:11:44] with any
[1:11:45] vindication but they got none
[1:11:50] amen and they were sincere and they
[1:11:54] labored and they had works and they had
[1:11:56] all these things brother and sister
[1:11:58] amen they had they probably had quotes
[1:12:01] for what they were doing
[1:12:02] amen they could probably justify their
[1:12:04] actions somehow in the word of god
[1:12:06] but they had no vindication amen but
[1:12:09] elijah didn't need a dozen
[1:12:11] amen he didn't need a dozen options
[1:12:14] he didn't need a backup plan he said
[1:12:17] there's one god
[1:12:18] he said now let god answer by fire
[1:12:22] and you know what it came to a showdown
[1:12:24] because when god struck that altar with
[1:12:26] fire
[1:12:26] and consumed the sacrifice and consumed
[1:12:28] the water now elijah said it's time for
[1:12:30] you to do something
[1:12:32] it's time for you to do something
[1:12:34] message believer
[1:12:35] go out there and find that false prophet
[1:12:38] go out there and find that bell priest
[1:12:40] that's been lying to you and taking your
[1:12:43] tithe and offering
[1:12:44] and telling you that was a real god go
[1:12:46] find that man and slay him
[1:12:49] silence the voice of the unbeliever
[1:12:52] cut it off don't listen to it don't
[1:12:55] argue with it
[1:12:57] don't feel sorry for it it's time for a
[1:12:59] showdown
[1:13:00] god has sent a prophet god is entered by
[1:13:03] fire
[1:13:04] and now it's time for people to silence
[1:13:07] silence the voice of satan
[1:13:11] they got enough courage they said if
[1:13:13] elijah can believe god that way
[1:13:15] i can believe god that way if elijah can
[1:13:17] call on god that way
[1:13:19] i can call on god that way if elijah can
[1:13:21] have that kind of boldness
[1:13:23] i can have that kind of boldness
[1:13:26] amen they made a decision
[1:13:30] and all 400 450 prophets of the hell
[1:13:34] were slain that day not by elijah
[1:13:38] by his followers by his followers
[1:13:43] they are divorced and they responded to
[1:13:46] the voice
[1:13:47] and when they responded the priest fell
[1:13:49] dead
[1:13:51] oh my you say
[1:13:54] brother tim you're inciting violence
[1:14:00] i don't know about you but the devil
[1:14:01] hadn't been nice to me
[1:14:05] he ain't played nice he fights dirty
[1:14:08] he fights mean i don't think it's time
[1:14:11] to spare the sword
[1:14:13] it's like our pastor says it's time to
[1:14:15] pull out the sword
[1:14:16] and throw the sheath away it's time to
[1:14:19] fight
[1:14:20] it's time for battle it's time for you
[1:14:23] to find out
[1:14:24] it's time for you to experience what the
[1:14:26] word of god can do
[1:14:28] it's time for you to experience who the
[1:14:30] god of elijah is
[1:14:32] it's not a memory it's not a history
[1:14:34] it's not a story
[1:14:36] it's a reality amen and you've got power
[1:14:39] over satan
[1:14:40] you've got authority over the devil amen
[1:14:45] amen showdown call for a nation to see
[1:14:49] who the true and living god is
[1:14:52] silence the false voices you know the
[1:14:55] bible
[1:14:56] the bible don't even say you have to
[1:14:58] overthrow satan
[1:15:00] it just says resistant
[1:15:04] the bible doesn't say you have to be
[1:15:06] stronger more mighty more powerful or
[1:15:09] more anointed
[1:15:10] the bible says resist him
[1:15:13] resist the devil and he will flee
[1:15:17] from you amen oh my
[1:15:21] there was a lady in the bible by the
[1:15:24] name of ruth
[1:15:26] and she her husband they went out of
[1:15:29] israel into a land of moab and their
[1:15:33] their sons married two daughters ruth
[1:15:34] and orpah
[1:15:36] and then ruth's husband died and uh
[1:15:39] excuse me naomi's husband died then ruth
[1:15:41] also and then naomi's
[1:15:43] all three widows here and and naomi says
[1:15:47] i'm going back home
[1:15:49] i'm going back to my land my people
[1:15:53] and my god and she gave ruth and orpha
[1:15:55] the opportunity to follow her
[1:15:58] and go along with her and she kind of
[1:16:00] told him the
[1:16:02] the pros and the cons the advantages and
[1:16:05] the disadvantages
[1:16:07] she let them make their own choice
[1:16:10] and to one the advantages
[1:16:14] outweigh the disadvantages but to the
[1:16:16] other
[1:16:17] she got to thinking about oh well well
[1:16:19] moab is my home
[1:16:21] and and moabitess people are my people
[1:16:24] and this is where all my history is and
[1:16:26] this is everything i've ever known
[1:16:29] so orpah turns and goes back
[1:16:33] to her homeland and naomi and ruth
[1:16:36] journey back into israel
[1:16:39] well you know the story how ruth
[1:16:42] went into the fields of boaz and began
[1:16:44] gleaning and called he
[1:16:45] caught the eye of boaz and then naomi
[1:16:49] instructed her
[1:16:50] on to stay right there
[1:16:54] oh stay right there you you found the
[1:16:57] right field
[1:16:58] yeah you you you're in the right church
[1:17:00] now
[1:17:01] you're you're in the right message now i
[1:17:04] mean that you're in other words
[1:17:05] you're not in a partial light you're not
[1:17:08] in some past
[1:17:09] age or some creed or dogma you
[1:17:12] you stay right there it may not seem
[1:17:14] like much now
[1:17:16] but this field will result in
[1:17:18] relationship
[1:17:21] amen so of course
[1:17:27] boaz ends up marrying ruth
[1:17:32] and two generations later
[1:17:36] ruth's great grandson
[1:17:40] becomes the king of israel david
[1:17:45] one of israel's greatest kings one of
[1:17:48] israel's most notable kings
[1:17:50] god was so pleased he said he's a man
[1:17:52] after my own heart
[1:17:53] and god said of of his seed the throne
[1:17:56] will never leave it
[1:17:58] amen but this is not
[1:18:02] in the scriptures or in the bible that i
[1:18:03] can find but
[1:18:05] in rabbinical tradition it's taught
[1:18:08] that when orpha went back she too
[1:18:12] gave birth and her offspring
[1:18:16] two generations later also produced
[1:18:19] someone
[1:18:20] by the name of goliath
[1:18:26] the power of a decision
[1:18:30] one decision brought
[1:18:34] ruth into the lineage of jesus christ
[1:18:39] the other decision birthed a tormentor
[1:18:44] a giant a a a disfigured
[1:18:47] beast that had all of
[1:18:50] israel in fear and trembling and i just
[1:18:54] love this
[1:18:55] because here's a little david you know
[1:18:56] he's small he's kind of a misfit
[1:19:00] he's not like his brothers he's not tall
[1:19:02] he's not handsome
[1:19:03] he's not strong he's not qualified
[1:19:07] and all his brothers are joining the
[1:19:08] army and they're going away and they're
[1:19:10] getting trained
[1:19:11] and they're getting uniforms and and
[1:19:13] good grades and
[1:19:14] all these things that david cannot do
[1:19:18] they're doing and they're moving up
[1:19:20] through the
[1:19:21] the ranks and through the echelon and
[1:19:22] they're all becoming great warriors
[1:19:24] and renowned warriors of saul but when
[1:19:27] goliath
[1:19:29] called to them they trembled
[1:19:32] and they shook oh my
[1:19:36] but david amen he was never
[1:19:39] in training to be a private or a
[1:19:43] sergeant
[1:19:44] or a captain or a lieutenant or a
[1:19:47] general
[1:19:48] david's training was to be king
[1:19:53] he was on a different path he had a
[1:19:56] different teacher
[1:19:57] he had a different leader oh my
[1:20:00] but on the day he visited that
[1:20:02] battlefront when he heard the voice
[1:20:05] of his distant cousin goliath
[1:20:08] saying send me a man send me a man send
[1:20:12] me a man
[1:20:12] and everybody who israel called a man
[1:20:16] trembled and shriveled
[1:20:20] at the sound of goliath's voice but one
[1:20:23] day
[1:20:24] those words send me a man caught the
[1:20:27] ears of a man
[1:20:30] oh my he might have been a boy
[1:20:33] but he had a man-sized god he had a
[1:20:36] relationship
[1:20:37] with the god of man oh my
[1:20:40] he said i won't go back i won't
[1:20:42] compromise
[1:20:43] i won't pretend i didn't hear that i
[1:20:46] won't be talked out of it
[1:20:48] i won't be convinced i won't wear saul's
[1:20:50] armor
[1:20:51] i can't rest until that goliath is dead
[1:20:56] and ruth's decision defeated orpha's
[1:20:59] decision
[1:21:00] on the battlefield amen
[1:21:06] [Applause]
[1:21:09] when the word of god is sent to an age
[1:21:11] or a generation
[1:21:13] it forces a decision
[1:21:16] or showdown when jesus came to earth
[1:21:19] the first time his ministry called for a
[1:21:22] showdown
[1:21:24] whosoever therefore shall confess me
[1:21:26] before men
[1:21:27] him will i also confess before my father
[1:21:30] which is in heaven
[1:21:31] but whosoever shall deny me before men
[1:21:34] him will i also deny before my father
[1:21:36] which is in heaven
[1:21:38] think not that i am come to send peace
[1:21:41] on earth i came not to send peace
[1:21:45] but a sword for i am come to set a man
[1:21:48] at variance against his father and the
[1:21:51] daughter against her mother and the
[1:21:52] daughter-in-law against her
[1:21:54] mother-in-law
[1:21:55] that's not the cause of all your family
[1:21:57] problems tonight
[1:22:00] but when it comes to this message when
[1:22:03] it comes to the word of god
[1:22:06] mother father brother sister
[1:22:10] cousin niece nephew in-laws are outlaws
[1:22:14] the word of god is
[1:22:18] where the line is drawn amen
[1:22:21] i preached this message sunday night in
[1:22:23] tucson arizona
[1:22:25] and a hispanic sister came up to me
[1:22:28] after the service
[1:22:28] and her face was glowing she was so
[1:22:31] happy
[1:22:32] she said oh brother tiff this service
[1:22:33] tonight was just for me
[1:22:35] she said just this afternoon i got a i
[1:22:38] got a
[1:22:39] a a message from my niece who is a
[1:22:42] lesbian
[1:22:42] and she's fixing to have a wedding to
[1:22:45] her lesbian partner
[1:22:46] and she invited me to the wedding
[1:22:50] and she said i had to tell her i can't
[1:22:52] come
[1:22:54] i can't support that i'm a christian
[1:22:57] amen i love you but i don't support
[1:23:00] your choices amen
[1:23:04] i don't support your lifestyle i'll tell
[1:23:06] you we've all been to these places
[1:23:10] but when that man of god stands up there
[1:23:12] and says can anyone show just cause
[1:23:14] why these two should not be lawfully
[1:23:17] joined together
[1:23:18] you do here now speak your peace or here
[1:23:21] after hold your peace
[1:23:22] if you have
[1:23:26] a disagreement you're obligated to stand
[1:23:29] and speak
[1:23:31] or don't go don't even be present
[1:23:36] now you do what the lord leads you to do
[1:23:38] but this woman made a choice
[1:23:40] she made a decision and i said you
[1:23:42] sister i said it's not that you are
[1:23:44] what you're standing against it's what
[1:23:47] you're standing for
[1:23:49] god will honor what you're standing for
[1:23:53] and i said if you compromise she may
[1:23:56] never see anything real enough in your
[1:23:59] life
[1:24:00] to desire what you have but if you take
[1:24:03] a stand for god
[1:24:04] and you in love will stand on the truth
[1:24:07] that girl though she may be
[1:24:08] lesbian now she will see a reality in
[1:24:11] your life
[1:24:12] that will give her confidence that one
[1:24:15] day she can
[1:24:16] approach you and say lead me to the god
[1:24:18] you know
[1:24:19] amen that's the kind of choice i want to
[1:24:22] make
[1:24:23] as a christian amen
[1:24:27] he that loveth a man's foes shall be
[1:24:29] they of his own household
[1:24:32] he that loveth father mother more than
[1:24:34] me is not worthy of me
[1:24:36] and he that loveth son or daughter more
[1:24:38] than me is not worthy of me
[1:24:40] showdown and he that taketh not his
[1:24:43] cross and followeth after me
[1:24:45] is not worthy of me he that findeth his
[1:24:47] life shall lose it
[1:24:48] and he that loseth his life for my sake
[1:24:52] shall find it the prophet of god said
[1:24:55] when the messenger from the sixth seal
[1:24:57] the messenger the angel come on earth
[1:24:59] the messenger of the hour like luther's
[1:25:01] like any of the messengers that we've
[1:25:03] talked of
[1:25:04] what does he do he arrives and the seal
[1:25:07] opened revealed a trumpet sound
[1:25:11] war declared and away they go
[1:25:14] and then the messenger dies he
[1:25:17] seals away this group who's that the
[1:25:20] believer
[1:25:22] those who made the choice to believe
[1:25:24] amen those who made the choice to be
[1:25:26] identified with the reproach
[1:25:28] amen those who didn't walk away when a
[1:25:31] website disagreed
[1:25:33] those who were sealed in by the revealed
[1:25:36] word of the hour
[1:25:37] they're put in and a plague falls
[1:25:41] upon those who rejected it
[1:25:44] amen i want to say tonight i'm coming to
[1:25:46] a close when god does something
[1:25:49] it really doesn't matter what anyone's
[1:25:51] opinion of it is
[1:25:55] it's a matter of do you believe it
[1:25:59] and will you follow it
[1:26:02] that's it it's really not up for you to
[1:26:04] decide whether or not it's right
[1:26:06] whether or not it's god whether or not
[1:26:08] any of these other things whether the
[1:26:10] world agrees with it or accepts it or
[1:26:11] any of those things
[1:26:12] you know something on the day that the
[1:26:16] flood waters
[1:26:17] lifted the ark to safety there were more
[1:26:20] believers
[1:26:21] under the boat than there were
[1:26:24] in the boat they just waited too long to
[1:26:28] be convinced
[1:26:35] when scientific proof
[1:26:39] vindicated noah's message it was too
[1:26:42] late to get on the boat then
[1:26:46] the ones in the ark was the ones that
[1:26:48] believed it before science agreed with
[1:26:50] it and they floated to safety and the
[1:26:54] ones that were waiting for the
[1:26:55] televisions and the websites
[1:26:57] and the scientists and the world council
[1:26:59] of churches to say it's right
[1:27:01] they drown under the boat amen
[1:27:05] imagine them children would say daddy
[1:27:07] i've never seen you blow so many bubbles
[1:27:09] wouldn't it have been easier to believe
[1:27:10] that farmer that farmer knew more about
[1:27:13] the weather than the scientists did
[1:27:16] hey that farmer was a prophet
[1:27:19] that game warden was a prophet that
[1:27:22] carpenter was a prophet
[1:27:24] that man was a prophet he was the voice
[1:27:26] of god
[1:27:27] and it wasn't his ideas and it wasn't
[1:27:29] his forecast
[1:27:30] it was god's forecast but because you
[1:27:33] made a choice
[1:27:35] because you made a decision when it was
[1:27:38] not popular
[1:27:39] when it was not accepted by the world
[1:27:41] when it could not be proven by science
[1:27:43] it puts you in the ark
[1:27:47] and the same water that drowned the
[1:27:49] unbeliever
[1:27:50] floated the believer lifted the ark
[1:27:53] over every obstacle and floated them
[1:27:56] into the new earth
[1:27:59] amen i'm not waiting on raindrops
[1:28:03] i'm not waiting on california to sink
[1:28:06] i'm not waiting on a brown bear
[1:28:08] i'm not waiting on those things i've
[1:28:10] already been persuaded
[1:28:12] and convinced i'm already sealed
[1:28:16] it's too late i'm already decided
[1:28:19] it's already damon it's already been
[1:28:22] decided
[1:28:23] and it wasn't altogether my choice it
[1:28:26] was a reflection of his
[1:28:28] choice
[1:28:29] [Laughter]
[1:28:31] hallelujah and i'm sealed away
[1:28:35] i don't control the door but i want to
[1:28:38] be on the right side of it
[1:28:41] amen amen
[1:28:45] when the hebrew children were faced with
[1:28:48] certain death
[1:28:50] the king asked them he said do you know
[1:28:53] whether god will deliver you or not they
[1:28:56] said no
[1:28:58] we don't know we don't know if he will
[1:29:04] we don't know exactly what he's going to
[1:29:07] do
[1:29:08] but we do know what we're not going to
[1:29:09] do
[1:29:12] we whether we live or whether we die
[1:29:17] i am not going to battle because i know
[1:29:20] to bow to surrender to
[1:29:23] compromise to agree with that is certain
[1:29:27] death amen so i'm going to
[1:29:30] stay with the god of daniel i'm not
[1:29:33] going to worship daniel
[1:29:34] i'm not going to worship william branham
[1:29:36] i never prayed to his picture
[1:29:38] i never prayed to hoffman's head of
[1:29:39] christ
[1:29:41] i saw god in that ministry god called me
[1:29:44] out of sin
[1:29:45] god spoke to me god said you're the pure
[1:29:48] sinless
[1:29:49] spotless virtuous bride of jesus christ
[1:29:52] i never heard a man i heard god the
[1:29:55] whole time
[1:29:58] and i said i will go i will go
[1:30:02] i will go just like ruth i will go
[1:30:05] i don't know what the future holds all
[1:30:06] together but i'm going
[1:30:08] know that our family don't understand it
[1:30:10] no that's not where i'm from
[1:30:12] but i'm going hallelujah
[1:30:17] my mind's made up i'm already convinced
[1:30:22] i'm not on the fence i'm not waiting
[1:30:26] i've already made up my mind
[1:30:29] amen many of our young people
[1:30:34] made the decision give their heart to
[1:30:36] the lord and
[1:30:37] take on his name in water baptism many
[1:30:40] are praying
[1:30:41] believing for god to fill them with the
[1:30:42] holy spirit
[1:30:44] i told my little niece i said the
[1:30:47] devil's going to tell you
[1:30:48] this don't mean nothing nothing happened
[1:30:52] and this wasn't anything but i said he's
[1:30:54] a liar
[1:30:56] i said you keep believing you go down in
[1:30:59] that water tonight
[1:31:01] take on the name of jesus christ in
[1:31:02] water baptism and he will
[1:31:04] fill you with the holy ghost amen
[1:31:08] oh my you'll face battles you'll face
[1:31:10] tests your friends may turn their backs
[1:31:12] on you
[1:31:13] the world will call you crazy but god
[1:31:15] will honor your stand
[1:31:17] moses esteem the reproach of christ
[1:31:19] greater riches
[1:31:21] than the treasures of egypt oh my
[1:31:24] and make sure your decisions aren't
[1:31:28] being influenced
[1:31:30] by well-meaning people
[1:31:36] whose place it is not to determine the
[1:31:39] will of god for your life
[1:31:44] because when the prophet of god stood
[1:31:46] beside the bed of his dying wife
[1:31:50] with tuberculosis she said he said
[1:31:54] she said do you know why honey he said
[1:31:57] don't say it
[1:31:58] she said we should have never listened
[1:32:02] to mother because
[1:32:07] he allowed her mother to call those
[1:32:10] pentecostal people trash
[1:32:13] he didn't call them trash she did
[1:32:16] but because he allowed her
[1:32:19] well-intentioned
[1:32:22] influence she she just wanted her
[1:32:26] daughter
[1:32:26] to be married to a successful preacher
[1:32:30] who like every other preacher she had
[1:32:32] ever known
[1:32:33] could be accepted he could have a nice
[1:32:36] fine church someday
[1:32:38] and a nice retirement in a nice car and
[1:32:42] with the gift he had no doubt a
[1:32:43] wonderful minute that's all
[1:32:45] she wanted for her daughter and
[1:32:47] son-in-law
[1:32:48] was success but look what
[1:32:53] their pursuit of her idea of success
[1:32:57] look where it led them she's dying
[1:33:00] and died and his little baby died
[1:33:05] well well-meaning people can influence
[1:33:09] you
[1:33:11] and it's not necessarily god's
[1:33:12] leadership
[1:33:14] we have to get before the lord and say
[1:33:17] lord
[1:33:18] i'm going to silence all those voices
[1:33:20] you direct my path
[1:33:23] amen as the musicians come back this
[1:33:26] evening
[1:33:27] how many of you have ever heard the song
[1:33:30] i have decided to follow jesus
[1:33:32] [Music]
[1:33:34] we probably all sung that song since we
[1:33:36] were children
[1:33:37] but do you know what the origins of that
[1:33:39] song are
[1:33:42] in the welsh revival 150 or so years ago
[1:33:47] out of that revival came many
[1:33:50] missionaries
[1:33:52] men and women who would
[1:33:55] feel the pull of god on their heart
[1:33:59] and sell their home
[1:34:02] leave everything they had ever had and
[1:34:05] go to
[1:34:05] some other region of the world where god
[1:34:07] was leading them
[1:34:09] take their children take their family
[1:34:10] and in many cases live in poverty
[1:34:13] and in destitute places and conditions
[1:34:17] for the rest of their lives that's what
[1:34:19] a revival produces
[1:34:21] is men and women who are willing to
[1:34:23] surrender everything
[1:34:25] and say lord wherever you send me i will
[1:34:28] go
[1:34:29] whatever you have for me lord i will do
[1:34:32] amen oh my god send us revival
[1:34:37] god's in a real revival amen and so one
[1:34:40] of those
[1:34:41] one of those missionaries and families
[1:34:43] ended up in a northern
[1:34:46] northern region of india which was the
[1:34:48] assam region and there were a lot of
[1:34:50] aggressive tribes there they called head
[1:34:52] hunters
[1:34:53] and so these headhunters you know very
[1:34:55] uh very vicious and they just
[1:34:57] just killed everybody and so they faced
[1:35:00] a lot of opposition
[1:35:02] but those missionaries were able to
[1:35:04] finally get a man in his family
[1:35:06] to convert to christianity the man's
[1:35:09] name was nox singh
[1:35:10] and he had two he had a wife and two
[1:35:12] little boys and so he accepted jesus
[1:35:15] christ as his savior
[1:35:16] he was filled with the holy ghost and as
[1:35:19] soon
[1:35:20] as the chief of his tribe of his village
[1:35:24] heard that noxian had accepted jesus
[1:35:26] christ as his savior he gathered the
[1:35:28] whole village
[1:35:30] here's all of noxing's friends everybody
[1:35:34] he's
[1:35:34] ever known his entire life looking on
[1:35:38] and the chief gives him this renounce
[1:35:42] your faith in jesus christ
[1:35:47] or your children will die
[1:35:48] [Music]
[1:35:50] you know what he said i have decided to
[1:35:56] follow
[1:35:56] jesus no turning back
[1:36:01] no turning back the chief
[1:36:04] ordered the boys to be shot and the
[1:36:06] arrows
[1:36:07] pierced them and they fell to the ground
[1:36:09] dying
[1:36:11] he said you have another opportunity he
[1:36:14] said deny your faith
[1:36:16] or we will kill your wife
[1:36:20] he said though no one joins me
[1:36:24] still
[1:36:28] i will follow i wonder how many of us
[1:36:31] [Music]
[1:36:33] could make that stand tonight
[1:36:36] whether they live or die could you serve
[1:36:40] god all by yourself
[1:36:43] [Music]
[1:36:46] that was his determination though no one
[1:36:49] joins me
[1:36:51] it's not about who joins me it's not
[1:36:54] about who agrees with me
[1:36:56] amen it's not about who understands me i
[1:36:59] mean it's not about how many friends i
[1:37:00] have on facebook
[1:37:02] though no one joins me still
[1:37:05] i will follow no turning back
[1:37:08] no turning back and his wife was killed
[1:37:12] the chief then asked for the final time
[1:37:16] for him to deny his faith and live
[1:37:20] and he gladly said these final words the
[1:37:23] cross before me
[1:37:25] the world behind me no turning back
[1:37:30] no turning back he was shot and killed
[1:37:33] on the spot never
[1:37:37] had the chief ever witnessed a person
[1:37:41] who could stand under such strong
[1:37:44] conviction
[1:37:45] and give their life for the cause
[1:37:49] of a man who had lived and died
[1:37:53] two thousand years ago
[1:37:56] he was so moved he said i too
[1:38:00] accept jesus christ as my lord and
[1:38:03] savior
[1:38:05] he repented the holy spirit filled him
[1:38:08] and all of the villagers accepted jesus
[1:38:12] christ
[1:38:12] as their savior and from that village it
[1:38:15] spread to the next village
[1:38:16] and to the next village a whole revival
[1:38:19] was sparked by one man
[1:38:24] one person's unwillingness
[1:38:27] to deny their faith you know what
[1:38:30] the moment noxing took his last breath
[1:38:33] he was rejoined with his wife
[1:38:36] he rejoined his children he joined
[1:38:39] the all the the saints of ages past
[1:38:42] had he compromised on one point
[1:38:47] that would have never happened that
[1:38:49] chief would have never accepted christ
[1:38:51] the village would have been lost and the
[1:38:53] revival would have never been sparked
[1:38:55] but because of the power of one man's
[1:38:59] decision
[1:39:01] look what took place amen i
[1:39:04] have decided stand with me
[1:39:08] to follow jesus

[1:41:11] no turning back
[1:41:15] no turning
[1:41:19] you love the lord this evening is that
[1:41:22] your decision
[1:41:24] i want to tell you something
[1:41:28] when he fills you with his spirit
[1:41:32] when you surrender your heart and life
[1:41:34] to the lord jesus
[1:41:36] repent of your sins take on his name
[1:41:40] and water baptism in the name of jesus
[1:41:42] christ and he
[1:41:43] fills you with his spirit he
[1:41:47] will do the things that you could never
[1:41:50] do
[1:41:52] because it won't be you trying it'll be
[1:41:54] him do it
[1:41:56] all you have to do is accept it
[1:41:59] when those 120 believers come out of the
[1:42:01] upper room on the day of pentecost
[1:42:03] the whole world was watching to see
[1:42:08] who are they now who are they now
[1:42:12] because before they met jesus
[1:42:17] they were fishermen
[1:42:20] and they were sailors
[1:42:24] but after they met him they couldn't do
[1:42:27] anything
[1:42:29] without him they couldn't catch
[1:42:32] fish without him
[1:42:36] they couldn't sell a boat from one side
[1:42:38] of the lake to the other
[1:42:40] without him whatever they could do
[1:42:42] before they met him
[1:42:44] they couldn't do anything after they met
[1:42:46] him
[1:42:48] unless he was with him and then when he
[1:42:50] was with him
[1:42:51] he made him cast out devils and heal the
[1:42:54] sick
[1:42:55] and they couldn't even do that without
[1:42:58] him
[1:42:59] oh my but he said
[1:43:04] it's expedient for you that i go away
[1:43:09] it's beneficial for you that i go away
[1:43:13] for if i go away i will come again
[1:43:19] [Music]
[1:43:20] and when they come staggering out of
[1:43:23] that upper room
[1:43:25] the whole world had to recognize very
[1:43:27] quickly
[1:43:29] he's back he's back
[1:43:34] he's not just with him now he's in him
[1:43:38] amen he's doing everything now now
[1:43:41] everything peter says is jesus christ
[1:43:44] amen silver and gold have i none but in
[1:43:46] the name of jesus christ
[1:43:48] rise up and walk amen oh my friend you
[1:43:51] can have him that way too
[1:43:53] and he can fill your heart and your life
[1:43:56] that way too
[1:43:57] i have decided
[1:44:01] to follow jesus
[1:44:05] i have decided
[1:44:09] to follow jesus
[1:44:13] i have decided
[1:44:17] to follow jesus
[1:44:21] no turning back
[1:44:25] no turning back
[1:44:29] amen now as they play very softly
[1:44:32] i'd like to invite you to bow your heads
[1:44:36] maybe you would be in this service
[1:44:37] tonight
[1:44:41] and you might say i accepted the lord
[1:44:45] jesus many years ago
[1:44:48] i've been saved i've been sanctified
[1:44:50] i've been filled with god's spirit i
[1:44:52] know
[1:44:53] i'm a son or daughter of god
[1:44:57] but i realized tonight that
[1:45:00] i too am like
[1:45:03] the children of israel that joshua spoke
[1:45:05] to on that day
[1:45:06] [Music]
[1:45:08] and i've carried a few things along with
[1:45:10] me
[1:45:10] [Music]
[1:45:12] that i know i really don't need if i can
[1:45:15] put all my faith
[1:45:17] and all my confidence in who the lord is
[1:45:23] or say or maybe you would realize that
[1:45:26] your steps
[1:45:27] have strayed your zeal
[1:45:31] has weakened and maybe you've allowed
[1:45:33] things to creep into your life
[1:45:36] your walk with the lord has grown cold
[1:45:38] distant
[1:45:40] or your love for the lord is not what it
[1:45:42] once was
[1:45:44] maybe you have begun to feel like you're
[1:45:48] the victim
[1:45:50] of all of the trauma and the
[1:45:53] torment and the sufferings that you've
[1:45:55] gone through
[1:45:57] you realize tonight you don't have to
[1:45:59] remain a victim
[1:46:01] you're a victor in jesus christ
[1:46:04] you can make a choice to forgive
[1:46:08] and a choice to place all those
[1:46:12] hard feelings and grudges and memories
[1:46:15] and
[1:46:15] all those things that have bound you in
[1:46:18] a prison
[1:46:20] i choose to place this at the altar
[1:46:24] and let god take it from me because i'm
[1:46:26] not gonna live as a prisoner
[1:46:29] or as a victim or as a partner to satan
[1:46:32] [Music]
[1:46:35] maybe you haven't accepted christ as
[1:46:37] your savior
[1:46:38] and you've never taken on his name and
[1:46:41] water baptism
[1:46:42] and made filled with the spirit say
[1:46:45] i don't want to leave this service
[1:46:46] tonight and turn down
[1:46:48] what could be my last opportunity
[1:46:52] lord jesus
[1:46:55] i believe your holy spirit is calling
[1:46:57] tonight
[1:47:00] to your children for a consecration
[1:47:06] not to rest in a confession
[1:47:11] or rest in
[1:47:13] [Music]
[1:47:15] an environment or security
[1:47:18] the message or message believers or
[1:47:21] spoken word tabernacle or any of these
[1:47:24] other things but realize they want to
[1:47:26] put their
[1:47:27] faith in confidence and consecrate their
[1:47:30] life fully
[1:47:31] completely to you tonight i pray lord
[1:47:34] jesus
[1:47:35] your holy spirit will lead that son of
[1:47:38] god that daughter of god
[1:47:41] lord to that altar that all
[1:47:44] consuming fire would calm lord jesus and
[1:47:48] consume away
[1:47:50] all the fear all the doubt all the
[1:47:53] unbelief lord
[1:47:54] all the anguish all the hurt lord all
[1:47:57] the bitterness
[1:47:59] all the chains lord and the bands
[1:48:02] lord that would try to bind them and
[1:48:04] hinder them lord and weaken their faith
[1:48:07] we rebuke it tonight in the name of the
[1:48:09] lord jesus christ
[1:48:11] lord you are speaking victory you are
[1:48:13] speaking healing lord god
[1:48:15] you're the great emancipator oh god it
[1:48:18] helped them to realize tonight

[1:48:24] can only loosen the bands and enable
[1:48:27] them lord to walk with you through the
[1:48:29] fire

[1:54:40] [Music]
[1:54:42] i'm going to say this i know there are
[1:54:46] some online
[1:54:47] and lord's willing some will follow
[1:54:49] through the week
[1:54:51] as the views goes up but i have to say
[1:54:54] it over again
[1:54:55] because the holy spirit is insisting
[1:54:58] under this
[1:55:00] last wednesday brother kelly preach
[1:55:03] and when he finished preaching i made a
[1:55:05] comment
[1:55:07] because god spoke to us
[1:55:10] that god made men to be an achiever
[1:55:15] but in order to do that you gotta let
[1:55:18] him do the work through you but not you
[1:55:21] doing the work and tonight the holy
[1:55:24] spirit spoke about the power
[1:55:26] of decision you can give
[1:55:30] many reason why you cannot be in church
[1:55:35] on wednesday i'm going to repeat it
[1:55:38] because i don't want to face him with
[1:55:40] your blood in my hand amen
[1:55:43] you can be three years four years
[1:55:47] without being able to be on church on
[1:55:50] wednesday and it never bothers you
[1:55:54] we might have one service on sunday and
[1:55:56] you miss it
[1:55:57] and you don't see that when you miss
[1:55:59] that service
[1:56:01] you are affecting your children because
[1:56:03] they depend on your transportation
[1:56:06] to be here in church and when you miss
[1:56:08] two services
[1:56:10] there will be the one missing two
[1:56:11] services
[1:56:13] and the way you study the message or
[1:56:15] you've been in a message
[1:56:16] they don't have that experience and they
[1:56:19] are longing
[1:56:20] to be in church but the problem is not
[1:56:22] them it's probably the one driving
[1:56:25] or it's probably somebody who want to
[1:56:26] take a decision
[1:56:28] to move or to do something without being
[1:56:31] even conscious about the kids
[1:56:34] you can be four five weeks not being in
[1:56:37] a church
[1:56:38] maybe four five seven sermon that you
[1:56:41] behind
[1:56:42] you have not even caught in because we
[1:56:45] put other things
[1:56:46] first before the kingdom of god amen
[1:56:51] one more time this is the time to take a
[1:56:53] decision
[1:56:55] whether you want to serve god in the
[1:56:57] category he's calling you
[1:56:59] or you don't want to do it amen if you
[1:57:03] notice
[1:57:03] for those that were in the same church
[1:57:06] with
[1:57:07] me where we came out of it we had quite
[1:57:10] a few people
[1:57:12] that needed french translation
[1:57:15] if you recall i was going out
[1:57:18] very few times i was almost
[1:57:22] all the time in church
[1:57:24] [Music]
[1:57:25] and the reason was my wife knows that
[1:57:29] i told her i say i don't see how i can
[1:57:31] leave
[1:57:33] a responsibility in the church
[1:57:36] and go serve somewhere else
[1:57:40] and there will be people coming in the
[1:57:42] church that won't be able to
[1:57:44] listen to the sermon because i'm not
[1:57:47] there
[1:57:48] i say i'm going to stay in the church if
[1:57:51] i find
[1:57:52] somebody to replace me who can do the
[1:57:55] job
[1:57:55] then i can go out and who help somebody
[1:57:59] but i'm not gonna neglect what god gave
[1:58:02] me
[1:58:02] first to go out to help somebody
[1:58:06] and their ship there that needed to hear
[1:58:09] the word of god
[1:58:10] that's why you saw me staying in the
[1:58:13] church for a long time
[1:58:15] and i noticed something when i come on
[1:58:17] wednesday i was coming from work
[1:58:20] and i usually get tired because i was
[1:58:22] working and coming to church
[1:58:24] and i had to translate and translating
[1:58:27] was like you were preaching
[1:58:29] exactly like the preacher who's
[1:58:30] preaching there
[1:58:32] amen i took a decision
[1:58:35] not here i didn't know i'm going to be a
[1:58:38] pastor in this church
[1:58:40] i took a decision i changed my work
[1:58:43] schedule
[1:58:45] amen to work from eight o'clock till two
[1:58:49] o'clock
[1:58:49] and stop on wednesday i can be making
[1:58:53] more money

[2:11:14] that
[2:11:15] being so used to stay in the house and
[2:11:18] they
[2:11:19] they took advantage of that and
[2:11:22] they changed the time for the service in

[2:12:08] everybody take his part i tell me my
[2:12:11] part
[2:12:12] my blessing i see the holy ghost talking
[2:12:15] to me
[2:12:17] and i was rejoined and i see
[2:12:20] that when he was talking certain things
[2:12:24] that he don't know but god and me knows
[2:12:28] he was he was uh talking in a special
[2:12:31] way
[2:12:32] that uh if i tell you you're gonna say
[2:12:36] oh wow
[2:12:37] but it's certain thing that is you know
[2:12:39] for everybody is private
[2:12:42] and uh a holy ghost is a private person
[2:12:47] he don't he don't respect you he's just

[2:13:04] of the holy pastor with his stick
