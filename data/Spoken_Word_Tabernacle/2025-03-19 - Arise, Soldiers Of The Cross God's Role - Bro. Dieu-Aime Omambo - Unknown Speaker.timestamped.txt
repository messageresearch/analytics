[44:49] question even even
[44:52] fail to
[44:55] believe that he he's been
[44:59] faithful
[45:01] faithful though in my
[45:05] heart I have
[45:08] questioned even

[54:06] you're waiting you know what to do right
[54:08] amen though the promise is tearing how
[54:10] do you
[54:11] wait praising the Lord and in
[54:14] Thanksgiving amen I believe it was
[54:16] either brother Robert we were talking as
[54:19] say Abraham when he was waiting he also
[54:22] was even
[54:24] preparing for the promise Not only was
[54:27] Abraham giving God glory but he put
[54:30] things into action amen so wedding is
[54:33] not what we thought waiting like Sting
[54:36] and just saying what are you doing I'm
[54:37] praying I'm waiting on the Lord no I'm
[54:40] praying I need a job no when you're
[54:43] praying you need a job when you stop I
[54:45] mean praying go ahead and stop putting
[54:48] make some application amen don't sit
[54:51] there and doing nothing and you say I'm
[54:54] waiting on the Lord amen
[54:56] amen we have an active faith not a
[55:00] passive one and then you're going to be
[55:02] blaming God you say I was here I was
[55:04] serving you all this day and look at
[55:06] this one no no no no no that one knew
[55:08] how to act the prodal son when he say I
[55:11] will arise and go to my father he
[55:13] doesn't sit anymore once he said that he
[55:16] rose and he begin to walk toward his
[55:18] father amen he didn't stop and say wait
[55:21] a minute what about if I go to the
[55:23] father and the father say I don't want
[55:25] to see you again
[55:26] what about if I go to the father and
[55:28] then the whole neighborhood begin to
[55:30] shout at me what about if I get to the
[55:32] city and all my old friend be I mean uh
[55:36] begin to look at me and then say look
[55:38] what have become to him that was none of
[55:41] his problem amen the target is I got to
[55:44] change my condition from what I am now
[55:47] to what I wanted to be and then he move
[55:50] on and as he's moving guess what who was
[55:52] there the Bible never mention about the
[55:55] neighbor the friend or the old people in
[55:58] the city the Bible only mention about
[56:01] the person he was going to so
[56:04] God I we we catch up on this on Sunday
[56:08] amen I'm not the one preaching amen
[56:10] don't sit down and
[56:12] wait the way human being are waiting
[56:16] amen waiting on the Lord wait like
[56:19] Abraham amen if you need something go
[56:22] walk in it amen talk about it praise God
[56:26] about it thank God about it amen amen
[56:30] because those that are waiting for the
[56:33] Lord those that wait upon the Lord they
[56:35] do what how do you renew the strength by
[56:40] waiting so there is something about that
[56:43] waiting on the Lord that will renew your
[56:46] strength and the Bible say when you
[56:48] renew your strength what do you do you
[56:50] man
[56:52] up I could not even touch that on Sunday
[56:55] you man up with with wings like what and
[56:58] what happen when you
[57:00] [Applause]
[57:03] run you shall walk and
[57:07] what so your walk become a different
[57:10] walk your running become a different
[57:12] running why because you got
[57:15] something somebody else will run and
[57:17] they will get weary because they're not
[57:19] waiting on the Lord but if you really
[57:21] truly are waiting on the Lord the
[57:23] correct way when you run
[57:26] you won't be weary when you walk you
[57:28] won't Fain amen because there is
[57:31] something about waiting on the Lord that
[57:33] is recharging you and that is giving you
[57:36] power Abraham where is the baby oh
[57:38] praise the lord it's this year but you
[57:41] have been waiting 10 years forgeted it
[57:43] is this year Abraham what do you think
[57:46] now it's 11 don't worry brother Bram say
[57:49] you know what it's going to get even
[57:50] bigger and greater Abraham 15 years you
[57:54] still holding on of course
[57:57] it is just like
[57:58] yesterday Abraham it's 20 years and
[58:01] finally at
[58:03] 25 now the miracle became greater it was
[58:06] no longer about just giving a child now
[58:09] they got to renew somebody give somebody
[58:11] a about change and remember if they give
[58:14] a body change the way it was
[58:17] originally Sarah could have been young
[58:20] and
[58:24] Barren I don't know if you get that the
[58:27] problem was Sarah was baren so if you
[58:29] just renew Sarah back again it's going
[58:32] to be the same Sarah and baren and the
[58:35] problem is still there so when you wait
[58:37] too
[58:38] long when the miracle comes it renews
[58:42] Sarah and also went and healed
[58:46] Sarah amen that's why when we we we will
[58:50] receive our body change there won't be
[58:53] any sickness again any defect that you
[58:56] have will be corrected right there and
[58:59] we will go into the Rapture completely
[59:01] here amen the longer it's taking the
[59:05] greater the
[59:07] miracle amen you were waiting for a baby
[59:10] now God give you a body change God give
[59:13] you the baby and God even deliver
[59:15] Sarah's womb all three by
[59:19] waiting amen amen glory to God married
[59:23] couple remember it's in a hotel

[59:59] amen and we will have some good time
[1:00:02] wonderful with the Lord amen this Bible

[1:00:07] the the pro you read the quote you see
[1:00:09] something you turn around two mouth you
[1:00:11] read the same code and it looks like you

[1:00:15] same it's like what is going on it is
[1:00:19] God who's unveiling himself God want
[1:00:22] every aspect of our life to be touched
[1:00:25] to be changed and to be completely
[1:00:27] different amen I came a little bit early
[1:00:29] I was in the office I said let me read
[1:00:31] the Bible and then start preparing for a
[1:00:34] scripture for Saturday and I say let me
[1:00:37] start reading book of Romans chapter 1
[1:00:40] and I begin to read chapter one I begin
[1:00:42] to write things left I read this many
[1:00:45] times but when I begin to read it looks
[1:00:47] like something new something news I say
[1:00:50] I understand this even better today than
[1:00:52] I understand yesterday brother we would
[1:00:55] never finish this part the power in this
[1:00:57] message is so strong I told my wife one
[1:01:00] quote one paragraph of brother Bram can
[1:01:03] preach the Bible for for three month one
[1:01:06] paragraph I'm not talking about one
[1:01:09] sermon when you open brother brandham
[1:01:11] sermon and you read one paragraph if you
[1:01:13] stop with one paragraph you take that
[1:01:15] one paragraph you put it in the Bible
[1:01:18] you can preach for three
[1:01:19] month that's so what you think it's a
[1:01:23] thousand and something uh What uh sermon
[1:01:26] it is more than that it is more than
[1:01:28] that it is powerful I told my wife I say
[1:01:31] what he just mentioned right now it can
[1:01:33] be a teaching for
[1:01:37] month this message we are so privileged
[1:01:41] hold Titan to the word it will produce
[1:01:44] what God say it will this message is
[1:01:48] real this message is Christ Amen brother

[1:03:39] midst of it can do anything and
[1:03:42] everything that you're in need of amen

[1:05:36] said unto Joshua choose us out men and
[1:05:40] go out fight with
[1:05:43] Amal tomorrow I will stand on the top of
[1:05:46] the hill with the rod of God in my hand
[1:05:50] may the Lord God bless the reading of
[1:05:51] his word you may be seated amen for my
[1:05:55] subject tonight will be arise soldiers
[1:05:58] of the Cross and as a subtitle it will
[1:06:01] be God's role and before I start I want
[1:06:04] to First say that uh what's it
[1:06:08] called for I want to say congratulations
[1:06:12] brother Charles for last Wednesday was
[1:06:13] very nice because what he preached it's
[1:06:16] like we were in the same road because
[1:06:19] right right before he preached like the
[1:06:21] night before I was talking to someone
[1:06:23] we're talking about faith and he came in
[1:06:25] and about it and he also mentioned
[1:06:27] something in particular that I also want
[1:06:28] to mention here because I did some
[1:06:31] research upon it yesterday what he was
[1:06:33] mentioning about was the natural birth
[1:06:35] how brother brandham said that it's a
[1:06:36] very mysterious thing that the natural
[1:06:38] birth how can because it's mysterious
[1:06:42] and wonderful because uh what's it
[1:06:44] called out of the experiment because I
[1:06:46] did research it was like 20 million to
[1:06:49] 600 million sperms and out of all of
[1:06:52] that you were chosen you were
[1:06:53] predestined to come out and that's
[1:06:55] that's a very some that's something very
[1:06:57] uh what's it called very good that you
[1:07:00] can hold on to to place your faith upon
[1:07:02] if you ever feel down that's something
[1:07:04] you can hold on to but let's say if you
[1:07:06] don't have uh what's it called the faith
[1:07:08] to hold on to that well think about it
[1:07:11] this way back then it was you versus 20
[1:07:15] million to 600 million other experiments
[1:07:18] but now in today's life if you take you
[1:07:20] apply to today there's like 8 billion
[1:07:22] people in the world there's like there's
[1:07:25] like one .3 billion that are like of
[1:07:27] Islamic faith and 3 billion that are
[1:07:29] like Christian most of them are
[1:07:31] denomination Catholic but now there's 8
[1:07:34] billion out of 8 billion people God
[1:07:36] chose you to be in this message God
[1:07:38] chose you to run this race and out of
[1:07:41] every single every single one um of
[1:07:44] those eight billion you being chosen
[1:07:46] that's something that's a great feed
[1:07:47] that's a great achievement in itself and
[1:07:49] that's something to be proud of if you
[1:07:51] ever fill down just remember you were
[1:07:52] chosen and the thing about being chosen
[1:07:55] is
[1:07:56] yes sir you can't just stop just because
[1:07:57] you're chosen because you're supposed to
[1:07:59] run the race and go all the way to the
[1:08:00] end you see run the race and go all the
[1:08:03] way to the end that's when you get
[1:08:04] that's when you will be crowned because
[1:08:06] it's to them that overcome that's when
[1:08:08] you will get your trophy it's basically
[1:08:11] like a track when you're racing and the
[1:08:14] thing about track is I'm not trying to
[1:08:16] uh what's it called promot the spirit
[1:08:17] competition but we're supposed to
[1:08:20] compete to reach Christ because that is
[1:08:22] our goal because when you're when we're
[1:08:25] brothers and we're racing to reach
[1:08:27] Christ as um because if I could use the
[1:08:31] board to illust real
[1:08:43] quick I believe everybody can see
[1:08:50] it because it's a race and yes we're
[1:08:53] racing but we're racing our goal is to
[1:08:55] achieve Christ imagine this is
[1:08:58] Christ this is Christ and let's say when
[1:09:02] you're born someone may be here someone
[1:09:05] may be here someone may be here someone
[1:09:06] may be here and as we're racing the goal
[1:09:09] is to reach Christ as you're racing
[1:09:11] you're coming to Christ he's coming to
[1:09:13] Christ she's coming to Christ we're all
[1:09:15] coming to Christ by the time we reach
[1:09:16] our goal all of us will be United that
[1:09:18] mean the race to reach Christ it's not
[1:09:21] yes it's an individual walk but towards
[1:09:23] the end we'll all it's like it's a many
[1:09:26] member um many membered body you see so
[1:09:28] as we're racing towards Christ and we're
[1:09:31] feeding on the word and we're walking on
[1:09:33] the own individual walk it's also
[1:09:35] bringing us together to Christ you see
[1:09:38] because if one person let's say one
[1:09:40] person is walking the other one is
[1:09:42] backsliding and as if I'm walking and
[1:09:45] you're backsliding the distance between
[1:09:47] me and Christ are getting closer and the
[1:09:49] distance between me and you are getting
[1:09:50] closer or getting farther apart if let's
[1:09:53] say uh what's it called neither of us
[1:09:55] are moving or both of us are moving away
[1:09:57] from Christ the distance between us and
[1:09:59] Christ is getting further apart and the
[1:10:01] distance between me and you also are
[1:10:02] getting farther cry farther
[1:10:06] apart anyway that was just a little
[1:10:08] thing that I wanted to encourage someone
[1:10:09] if you ever feel low just remember you
[1:10:11] were chosen to run this race out of 8
[1:10:13] billion people you were chosen and even
[1:10:16] then there were people that received the
[1:10:17] first oil but you have to receive but
[1:10:19] you were chosen not only for the first
[1:10:21] oil but for the second oil for the word
[1:10:23] of the of your day the message of your
[1:10:25] your
[1:10:27] time now if we go if we go if we could
[1:10:29] go back to our scripture where we read
[1:10:32] Because as you can see the title is
[1:10:34] arise soldiers of um the cross God's
[1:10:37] role and the reason why I say God's role
[1:10:40] was because when I was reading this I
[1:10:41] found out there was our role and then
[1:10:43] there was God's role because if you read
[1:10:46] it says Moses said unto Joshua and if
[1:10:48] you remember God had made Moses a god
[1:10:52] onto the Egyptian onto Pharaoh but then
[1:10:54] again that godhood that God put upon
[1:10:56] Moses didn't limit just at the Egyptian
[1:11:00] because when when Moses went to the
[1:11:02] Egyptian and went to Pharaoh he said let
[1:11:04] my people go see he was he was God's
[1:11:07] people but he was calling it his own
[1:11:08] people see God had made him God unto
[1:11:11] other people and brother brand had also
[1:11:13] said that a Christian is supposed to be
[1:11:14] like a typologist you're supposed to
[1:11:16] type the scripture type the old to the
[1:11:18] new and even type it to your current
[1:11:20] time and right now I'm typing Moses to
[1:11:24] God and Joshua which is a type of Christ
[1:11:27] is also a type of the Holy Ghost and I'm
[1:11:29] typing that as the Holy Ghost because it
[1:11:31] says because it says Josh Moses said
[1:11:34] unto Joshua choose us out men you see
[1:11:37] because the Holy Ghost the purpose of
[1:11:38] the Holy Ghost which was which is the
[1:11:40] third person the Trinity the purpose of
[1:11:42] it is to choose the bride and enter into
[1:11:45] the bride and after you choose the bride
[1:11:47] that's when your battle um starts your
[1:11:48] battle between you and Satan because the
[1:11:51] thing that triggers Satan is God and if
[1:11:53] you don't have God in you Satan will not
[1:11:55] be be triggered and when someone is not
[1:11:56] triggered they will not react you see
[1:11:59] and over here it says Moses said unto
[1:12:02] Joshua choose us out men and go out
[1:12:05] fight with AMC that's our part that's
[1:12:08] the holy ghost coming in us and after it
[1:12:10] comes in us we go out that we fight with
[1:12:12] uh what's it called the spirits that are
[1:12:14] coming around that's our parts then the
[1:12:16] part where where I'm typing it as in
[1:12:19] God's part which is Moses he says
[1:12:22] tomorrow I will stand on the top to of
[1:12:25] the hill with the rod of God in my hand
[1:12:29] see that's when he went up the mountain
[1:12:31] which represented also the cross Calvary
[1:12:33] that's God's part that's what God is
[1:12:35] going to do that's right if we could
[1:12:37] drop sorry but we'll be doing a lot of
[1:12:39] reading today but if we could drop to
[1:12:42] verse 11 it says and it came to pass
[1:12:45] when Moses held up his hands and Israel
[1:12:49] prevailed and when he let down his hand
[1:12:52] amalec prevailed but Moses hands were
[1:12:55] heavy and they took a stone and put it
[1:12:58] under him and he sat
[1:13:04] there excuse
[1:13:11] me put under him and he sat there on and
[1:13:14] Aaron and and her stay up his hands and
[1:13:18] one of the one on the one side and the
[1:13:21] other on the other side and his hands
[1:13:23] were steady until the going down of the
[1:13:26] sun see that represent the great battle
[1:13:28] at Calvary the great battle between
[1:13:32] um the great battle
[1:13:36] between between death and uh what's it
[1:13:38] called God death and life the great
[1:13:41] battle between death and life that Jesus
[1:13:44] overcame and and in that battle there's
[1:13:47] God's part and there's our part because
[1:13:50] if you go down to verse 13 say Joshua's
[1:13:53] conf confited AMC and his people with
[1:13:56] the edge of his sword and like I said
[1:13:59] Joshua representing the Holy Ghost
[1:14:00] representing us that's our part but I'm
[1:14:03] specifically focusing on God's part
[1:14:08] today and if we go to uh what's it
[1:14:10] called
[1:14:12] because if we go to verse 14 and the
[1:14:15] Lord said unto Moses this is the Lord
[1:14:18] speaking write for a memorial in a book
[1:14:21] and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua
[1:14:24] for our will utterly put it in the ears
[1:14:27] of Joshua for I will utterly put out out
[1:14:30] the remembrance of AMC from under heaven
[1:14:34] when I was reading that scripture it
[1:14:35] would kind of pause me I was like why
[1:14:36] did he just say Joshua so I decided to
[1:14:38] consult some people and ask like my
[1:14:41] father asked brother Charles I asked
[1:14:42] them what what they received out of it
[1:14:45] because when I saw I felt something was
[1:14:47] there but it's like it's as if I could
[1:14:48] have obtaining and when I asked them and
[1:14:51] one had said well God was telling to
[1:14:53] remember was telling Joshua tell Moses
[1:14:56] to tell Joshua so Joshua can tell the
[1:14:58] Miracles that had happened for
[1:15:00] Generation to Generations so they can
[1:15:02] keep remembering it for generations to
[1:15:03] generations and at the other
[1:15:06] hand the miracle that happened which
[1:15:09] represented the cross represented
[1:15:12] Calvary Moos God is telling Moses to
[1:15:15] tell Joshua that you need to look up a
[1:15:17] Calvary you need to look up a the great
[1:15:19] battle that y'all had won and that great
[1:15:22] battle is what helped Joshua have the
[1:15:24] faith to face the son and to tell the
[1:15:26] son to stop the the the fact that um God
[1:15:30] told Moses to keep reminding Jo Joshua
[1:15:34] is a type of God trying to reinforce his
[1:15:36] faith you see because Faith by
[1:15:39] experience it's a type of God
[1:15:41] reinforcing his
[1:15:43] faith because when I was reading the
[1:15:44] scripture I found out that there's like
[1:15:46] a freebie uh for blessing here why
[1:15:50] because Jesus has said Jesus has said
[1:15:53] blessed is he that believe with without
[1:15:55] seeing just by hearing and if you notice
[1:15:58] here God said he will wipe out amale
[1:16:01] completely out of the face of the Earth
[1:16:03] meaning there will not be any source for
[1:16:05] you to trace or there will not be any
[1:16:08] evidence for you to see that means for
[1:16:09] you to believe it's going to be hard to
[1:16:11] begin with then the only way for you to
[1:16:13] even know that story exists is by you
[1:16:15] hearing and by you hearing it you have
[1:16:17] two options either to accept it or to to
[1:16:20] um deny it and by you accepting it
[1:16:22] that's an automatic free blessing right
[1:16:23] there that's that's automatically uh
[1:16:26] automatic free blessing that Jesus
[1:16:28] placed there for people to get um
[1:16:31] freely just like the serpent seed if you
[1:16:34] look at the serpent seed when if you
[1:16:36] look at the Bible a Ser the serpent was
[1:16:38] an upright being but because of the Fall
[1:16:41] God had completely broken down the trace
[1:16:44] of the serpent that if you're looking
[1:16:46] back in history you're trying to find
[1:16:48] that animal that was the closest to
[1:16:50] mankind you won't be able to find it
[1:16:52] that mean to even believe a snake used
[1:16:55] to be a upright being is very hard to
[1:16:57] believe but God erased that completely
[1:17:00] so that way the only way that you can
[1:17:02] understand or know of the story is by
[1:17:05] hearing it and when you hear it and you
[1:17:07] accept it that's an automatic free
[1:17:08] blessing which is connected to what the
[1:17:10] word of Jesus Christ that said blessed
[1:17:12] is he that believe without seeing the
[1:17:14] the one that are not looking for
[1:17:15] physical evidence because many people
[1:17:17] tend to seek for physical
[1:17:23] evidence and um if we could go to
[1:17:27] verse 16 for he said because the Lord
[1:17:31] has sworn that the Lord will have war
[1:17:34] with Amal from generation to generation
[1:17:36] this battle here is between God and Amal
[1:17:39] it's not between uh what's it call also
[1:17:41] em between God and EM because if you
[1:17:44] remember the title is God's role that
[1:17:46] mean we're we're finding what is God's
[1:17:48] role what's God's business in this war
[1:17:50] what is God's purpose in this war what
[1:17:52] is God's purpose in our life in this war
[1:17:55] how is he going to help us you see and I
[1:17:58] want to also read brother Brandon
[1:18:00] brother Brandon has said and stand still
[1:18:03] and see the salvation of the Lord
[1:18:05] paragraph 40 I preach Christ the same
[1:18:07] yesterday today and forever stand still
[1:18:10] and see the glory of God it's not your
[1:18:13] battle to begin with it's God's battle
[1:18:16] it isn't your promise to begin with it's
[1:18:18] God's promise and see he said that it's
[1:18:22] not you didn't begin to you didn't even
[1:18:24] start the battle to with so why are you
[1:18:25] worried over it remember uh the word was
[1:18:28] preaching say worri for nothing you see
[1:18:31] I stand tonight it's not my worry to to
[1:18:34] find out about this woman is God's
[1:18:37] promise to do it that's right I stand
[1:18:40] still and the glory of God does the work
[1:18:43] it's kind of like this Sunday when uh
[1:18:44] the pastor had asked uh what's it called
[1:18:47] when the pastor had asked sister yok he
[1:18:48] was like were you worried about this did
[1:18:49] you pray about she was like she said no
[1:18:51] see it wasn't her job to worry about
[1:18:53] when when the uh hus is going to come
[1:18:55] all she had to do is just stand still
[1:18:57] and wait and do God's work you
[1:18:59] see I put one I put one of my word I put
[1:19:04] one of my own words in it wouldn't be
[1:19:07] right I don't put my words in I just
[1:19:10] stand still let God do it don't you get
[1:19:14] worked up say well if I had prayed if I
[1:19:17] had a prayer card it says to stand still
[1:19:20] because a lot of people want to rush
[1:19:22] like to say like the word has been
[1:19:24] preaching a lot of people want to put
[1:19:25] God in a box the box of time instead of
[1:19:28] standing still and waiting upon the Lord
[1:19:30] You Prayed sure that your prayer went
[1:19:31] now you stand still and you wait and the
[1:19:33] thing the reason why people like putting
[1:19:35] God in a box of time is because we were
[1:19:38] placed in a box of time we were plac in
[1:19:41] the box of time if you even go to uh
[1:19:43] Psalms 89 there was someone that had
[1:19:45] sent me this earlier if you go to Psalms
[1:19:48] 89 uh you don't have to go I have it
[1:19:50] right here uh it says how long Lord will
[1:19:53] thou hide thyself forever sh shal thy R
[1:19:58] burn like fire remember how short my
[1:20:01] time is wherefor hast Thou made all men
[1:20:04] in vain what man is he that liveth and
[1:20:07] shall not see Death Shall he deliver his
[1:20:09] soul from the hand of the Grave saah
[1:20:13] Lord where are thy former loving
[1:20:15] kindness which thou swearest unto David
[1:20:18] in thy truth see this this um this
[1:20:22] scripture because our life is shortened
[1:20:26] we want to put God in uh what's it
[1:20:27] called we want
[1:20:28] to put God in a time box and we want to
[1:20:32] accelerate the blessing to come faster
[1:20:35] because we're looking maybe uh for
[1:20:38] example you could be sitting down in
[1:20:39] your living room after you see how the
[1:20:40] news someone that was your age just died
[1:20:43] and you're like that could be me so now
[1:20:45] you go pray and you say Lord God make
[1:20:46] can you make it faster because I could
[1:20:49] die at any moment so I want the blessing
[1:20:51] to come faster before I die you see we
[1:20:53] want to put God in the time box because
[1:20:55] we ourselves are in a time box because
[1:20:58] death can take us at any moment if he
[1:21:00] doesn't take us right now through a
[1:21:01] heart attack he's going to take us by
[1:21:02] old age we're in a taking uh what's it
[1:21:05] called Time Bomb so we want to also put
[1:21:08] God in the same uh place as
[1:21:11] us and the prophet of God says he
[1:21:14] continues says so in the great day of
[1:21:18] hour of FL fluster which is like
[1:21:21] agitation the Lord spoke and he spoke to
[1:21:24] a little Prophet standing near excuse me
[1:21:28] who says stand still and see the
[1:21:30] salvation of God you'll not have to
[1:21:33] fight this battle so you might be going
[1:21:34] through some trials and earlier we had
[1:21:37] found out that a prophets anyone can be
[1:21:39] a prophet you see and I'm not saying
[1:21:42] like I'm not just talking about a major
[1:21:43] prophet not anyone can be a major
[1:21:45] prophet don't get that wrong but anyone
[1:21:47] could be a prophet why because the word
[1:21:48] of God comes to the prophet and the
[1:21:49] prophet goes and preach it and I could
[1:21:52] top it because the word of God came to
[1:21:53] brother brandom and brother Brandon
[1:21:55] preached it that makes him a prophet and
[1:21:57] he's the major prophet but now since the
[1:21:59] word of God came to brother Brandon I'm
[1:22:00] not taking that word of God from brother
[1:22:02] Brandon and I'm reading it that mean
[1:22:04] that word of God also came to me and by
[1:22:06] me preaching it that means I'm doing the
[1:22:08] works that the prophet did and remember
[1:22:10] I said everyone can also be a prophet
[1:22:12] how about the sisters since they can't
[1:22:13] come up and minister they can Minister
[1:22:15] through their own life because brother
[1:22:17] Brandon said preach um live me a sermon
[1:22:19] not preach me one you see through your
[1:22:21] own life you're ministering to your
[1:22:23] folks your neighbors left and
[1:22:26] right and it says uh what's it called
[1:22:29] the little Prophet standing near who say
[1:22:31] stand still as the word has been coming
[1:22:33] forth and telling you when you pray just
[1:22:36] be patient wait on God's time it's
[1:22:37] telling you to stand still you see but
[1:22:40] as long as they were together and
[1:22:43] praying and praying it was God's battle
[1:22:46] you see and I think the same thing
[1:22:49] applies tonight that mean through your
[1:22:51] trials that you're going through May you
[1:22:52] have prayed for or not just stand still
[1:22:54] doesn't say sit down still but stand
[1:22:56] still and in this great hour where the
[1:23:01] church where the great church people and
[1:23:03] the great churches are stewing and
[1:23:06] fussing with each other and and
[1:23:08] denominational barriers are breaking us
[1:23:10] apart and we battle from this side and
[1:23:13] that side it's time to stand still God
[1:23:17] it's God's battle see you you really
[1:23:19] don't have much to do in this battle
[1:23:22] it's God's B he said it's his battle
[1:23:23] against the
[1:23:24] and it's going to go for generations to
[1:23:26] Generations you see and it Contin says
[1:23:29] it's not ours to begin with God wants us
[1:23:32] to stand still and when God gets ready
[1:23:35] to do anything usually he commands his
[1:23:37] people to stand still you see I found
[1:23:40] out recently there's a lot of um kids in
[1:23:43] here that took RTC you know and I myself
[1:23:46] also took RTC and whenever there's an
[1:23:50] announcement ready to be given because I
[1:23:52] was like a master surgeon um during my
[1:23:56] senior year whenever there's a
[1:23:58] announcement ready to be given a command
[1:24:00] that's ready to be given that my teacher
[1:24:02] would tell me call the platoon at ease
[1:24:05] at ease that mean you have to stand at
[1:24:07] ease you stand still so you can wait for
[1:24:08] the word to come forth you see and of
[1:24:11] here brother Brenham is saying before
[1:24:13] God gets ready to do anything he usually
[1:24:16] commands you to stand still and when God
[1:24:19] usually commands someone to stand still
[1:24:20] that's when someone wants to actually
[1:24:22] start moving because even in RC when you
[1:24:25] command someone stand still you will see
[1:24:26] certain people they're like fidgeting a
[1:24:28] little bit or trying to talk to their
[1:24:30] neighbor when God said to stand still
[1:24:31] and wait for his
[1:24:37] command and
[1:24:40] um this i p here the captain of the lord
[1:24:43] of the host because uh what's it called
[1:24:46] if you go
[1:24:47] to Joshua 5:20 when Joshua is a man of
[1:24:52] war he was always ready because when he
[1:24:54] saw a man coming he automatically took
[1:24:56] out his uh sword meaning he had his
[1:24:58] sword on him he always he was always on
[1:25:01] guard you couldn't find him slacking and
[1:25:04] brother Brenham said uh what's it called
[1:25:06] a sword represents prayer a sword is
[1:25:09] also the word that he always had the
[1:25:11] word on him to fight with and when he
[1:25:13] noticed the man that was there was the
[1:25:15] commander was the captain of the army of
[1:25:18] the Lord he worshiped him and brother
[1:25:21] brandham has said that that Captain that
[1:25:23] man was Jesus Christ
[1:25:25] that man was Jesus Christ brother BR has
[1:25:28] said uh what's it called he said nay but
[1:25:31] I'm the captain because this was when
[1:25:32] Joshua asked the man who are you are you
[1:25:34] for us or against us he was like nay but
[1:25:37] I'm the captain of the host of the Lord
[1:25:40] take off the shoes upon your feet I love
[1:25:44] this part for the ground you stand on is
[1:25:46] Holy because Joshua was under the uh
[1:25:49] Ministry of uh Moses and Moses had to do
[1:25:51] the same thing so Joshua is repeating
[1:25:53] what his Prophet did you see and that
[1:25:55] mean we should also repeat what our
[1:25:57] Prophet did that we should experience
[1:25:58] what our Prophet also experienced he met
[1:26:01] Jesus there face to face the captain of
[1:26:04] the host of the Lord and he told him
[1:26:07] what to do to March around the walls
[1:26:09] sound a trumpet let out a shot and the
[1:26:11] walls of Jericho would fall and they
[1:26:14] took the land of Palestine settled down
[1:26:16] in there as God promised them because
[1:26:19] the promise of God was for them see if
[1:26:22] you read all of this it's just God God
[1:26:24] God it was God it was
[1:26:25] Jesus and as our title is It's God's
[1:26:29] role I want to focus on God's role in
[1:26:31] this whole entire battle and if we could
[1:26:34] go to uh go back a few chapters Exodus
[1:26:37] chapter
[1:26:41] 15 Exodus chapter 15 because I want to
[1:26:44] talk about how God God's role what is
[1:26:47] God actually doing in our life through
[1:26:49] this uh battle that we're facing to this
[1:26:51] war that we're going
[1:26:52] through if you if you there can you say
[1:26:55] amen amen Exodus chapter 15 I'll try to
[1:26:59] like kind of speed a little bit through
[1:27:00] it then then sang Moses let's start
[1:27:04] verse one then sang Moses and the
[1:27:06] children of Israel this song unto the
[1:27:09] Lord and spake sing I will sing unto the
[1:27:11] Lord for he hath triumphed gloriously
[1:27:14] and the horse gloriously the horse and
[1:27:18] his rider have he thrown into the sea
[1:27:20] this is talking about Pharaoh's horse
[1:27:22] and his Riders see this is God who's the
[1:27:24] one who's doing everything the Lord is
[1:27:27] my strength and song if you remember
[1:27:30] there's a scripture in the in the Bible
[1:27:31] where it says that God is strong with
[1:27:33] capital S saying that that word strong
[1:27:36] is God
[1:27:37] himself he is my strength and song and
[1:27:41] he is become my salvation he is my God
[1:27:44] and I will prepare him in habitation my
[1:27:47] father's God and I will exalt him when I
[1:27:50] was reading the part where it say I will
[1:27:51] prepare him in a a um habit a and I was
[1:27:55] like let me type it to myself because
[1:27:57] God does not dwell in a um habitation
[1:28:00] created by man's hand and I was like
[1:28:02] then what type of habitation could I
[1:28:03] prepare for God I was like it's myself
[1:28:06] because God created me so the best thing
[1:28:08] I could do is prepare this body for God
[1:28:11] let me consecrate this body so God can
[1:28:13] use it to its utmost um um potential so
[1:28:17] they think that I could prepare is my
[1:28:20] body for God to use then verse three the
[1:28:23] Lord is a man see he say God is a man so
[1:28:26] let's find out what type of man he is
[1:28:27] and say the Lord is a man of war the
[1:28:32] Lord is his name see it says the Lord is
[1:28:34] a man of war now let's find out what
[1:28:37] does the Lord do in War what is his role
[1:28:39] what does he do in war it say Pharaoh's
[1:28:42] chariots and his host have he cast into
[1:28:45] the sea his chosen Captain also are
[1:28:49] drowned in the sea in the Red Sea see
[1:28:51] it's God who's taking the Pharaoh and
[1:28:53] throwing a out
[1:28:54] God who's taking his uh what's it called
[1:28:56] his soldiers and also throwing them out
[1:28:59] and if you drop down to verse six where
[1:29:01] it says thy right hand oh Lord is become
[1:29:04] glorious in power thy right hand oh Lord
[1:29:08] has dashed in pieces the enemy I
[1:29:11] remember many time brother Bron has said
[1:29:13] what's it called um the right hand of
[1:29:15] God represents power that's right it
[1:29:17] represents power and authority when
[1:29:19] Jesus went to the right hand it was the
[1:29:20] right hand of God which represented
[1:29:22] power and if you look uh what called in
[1:29:25] Matthew 26 verse 20 uh 64 and even L
[1:29:30] Luke 22: 69 Jesus says that he goes up
[1:29:33] to the father to the right hand of power
[1:29:35] which the right hand speaks of power
[1:29:37] itself and now let's find out what type
[1:29:39] of power is being manifest through the
[1:29:41] right hand of God because we're trying
[1:29:42] to find out what God is doing in our
[1:29:44] life through this war you see and in
[1:29:47] verse six again it says if you uh the
[1:29:49] second half of the Scripture it says thy
[1:29:51] right hand oh Lord now watch what he
[1:29:54] does it t right hand oh Lord have dashed
[1:29:58] in pieces the enemy see is destroying
[1:30:00] the enemy in pieces and in the greatness
[1:30:03] of thy Excellency thou H has overthrown
[1:30:07] them that rose up against thee when I
[1:30:10] was reading this scripture there was
[1:30:11] something that hit me because Jesus has
[1:30:14] said that you will be persecuted and you
[1:30:18] will be you will go through trials and
[1:30:20] tribulation people will hate you they
[1:30:22] will not hate you because of of you but
[1:30:24] they will hate you because of God and
[1:30:26] when that scripture came to me and I was
[1:30:27] reading this and it was like in because
[1:30:30] I decided to re replace it time with
[1:30:33] Jesus because it's talking about God and
[1:30:35] it was a in the greatness of Jesus
[1:30:38] Excellency Jesus has overthrown them
[1:30:41] that rose up against Jesus meaning those
[1:30:43] that rise up against Jesus in your life
[1:30:47] God himself is overthrowing them God
[1:30:49] himself is watching over you and
[1:30:51] overthrowing them in your life as you're
[1:30:52] going through your battles you see
[1:30:54] that's right and in verse 8 and with the
[1:30:57] blast of thy nostril the waters were
[1:31:00] gathered together the flaw stood upright
[1:31:02] as as a heap and the death were conil in
[1:31:06] the heart of the sea the enemy said I
[1:31:10] will pursue I will overtake I will dive
[1:31:13] I will divide the spoil my lust shall
[1:31:16] satisfy upon them I will draw my I will
[1:31:20] draw my sword my sword my hand shall
[1:31:23] destroy them
[1:31:24] see this part is where your enemy
[1:31:27] because your enemy it could be your
[1:31:29] neighbor it could be someone that you
[1:31:30] don't know that are always wishing for
[1:31:32] your downfall that was always trying to
[1:31:33] bring you down and they're probably
[1:31:36] probably somewhere praying for your
[1:31:38] downfall they think you're maybe you're
[1:31:40] just barely living and they see to them
[1:31:43] it looks like you're all the way up
[1:31:45] above although you're barely making it
[1:31:47] and because they see that you're better
[1:31:49] than them they're trying to pray for
[1:31:50] your downfall instead of trying to pray
[1:31:52] that you get lifted up because if get
[1:31:54] lifted off you will bring them with you
[1:31:55] but they don't have that mentality so
[1:31:57] they try to bring you down to their
[1:31:59] level and and watch what the Lord does
[1:32:02] to people that come in your life that
[1:32:04] are trying to bring you down they trying
[1:32:07] to uh pre preach or speak upon your
[1:32:11] downfall and it says in verse um 10 thou
[1:32:15] dest blow thou did blow thy wind in the
[1:32:19] sea cover them they sank as as lead in
[1:32:22] The Mighty water see God Blow The Wind
[1:32:25] and he sunk them that mean any enemy
[1:32:27] that comes against you they shall not
[1:32:29] Prosper any weapon that comes against
[1:32:30] you it shall not Prosper why because the
[1:32:32] Lord God is protecting you the Lord
[1:32:35] God's role is to protect you through
[1:32:36] through the whole entire um combat that
[1:32:39] you're facing you see when enemies are
[1:32:40] coming in like a flood they're fighting
[1:32:42] against you they're they're speaking of
[1:32:44] your downfall God is raising up a
[1:32:45] standard and usually when God rais up a
[1:32:47] standard the standard some is the
[1:32:50] standard of his word and sometime that
[1:32:52] standard of his word is not just is is
[1:32:55] usually tightening up his word you see
[1:32:58] because nowadays when everything is
[1:33:00] online everything any type of um Spirit
[1:33:04] attacks everything is online the Lord
[1:33:06] God is tightening it up and telling you
[1:33:07] you shouldn't do this you shouldn't do
[1:33:09] this you shouldn't do this he tightening
[1:33:10] it up and by him tightening it up is
[1:33:13] making it harder for you it's making the
[1:33:15] standard go up now you have to try to
[1:33:17] reach and follow the standard you see
[1:33:19] it's not because if you look at people
[1:33:22] in the denomination when you give them
[1:33:23] the word when they look at the word most
[1:33:25] of them when you give them the word
[1:33:27] they're like well the word says to come
[1:33:29] to the Lord as you are you see and they
[1:33:31] will come to the Lord as you are and
[1:33:33] they will stay as you are but the thing
[1:33:36] is when you stay as you are the enemy
[1:33:39] will come in and start giving influences
[1:33:41] left and right and when the enemy start
[1:33:43] giving influences left and right the
[1:33:45] word of God will tighten that's how the
[1:33:48] standard is lifted the standard is
[1:33:49] lifted because the word is tightened
[1:33:51] it's telling you now now as You Came As
[1:33:53] You Are now you can't stay as you are
[1:33:55] anymore because the enemy is coming it's
[1:33:57] like it's like you're uh what's it
[1:33:59] called We're pilgrims we're advancing in
[1:34:01] the we're advancing to get to the
[1:34:02] promised land is you came to a certain
[1:34:05] place you placed your tent you got a
[1:34:07] little bit comfortable and now God is
[1:34:08] telling you to he's starting to tighten
[1:34:10] you up and say now it's time to get up
[1:34:12] and keep moving you can't stand there
[1:34:14] it's time to get up and keep moving
[1:34:15] because the enemy will be
[1:34:17] [Applause]
[1:34:19] coming and um if you go to verse 11 who
[1:34:23] is like on to thee Oh Lord among the
[1:34:26] gods who is like thee glorious in
[1:34:29] Holiness fearful in Praises doing
[1:34:33] wonders because if you look at this even
[1:34:35] John when he went up in heaven he was
[1:34:37] like who is worthy to open the book and
[1:34:39] it was Jesus Jesus the only person that
[1:34:41] is worthy there's no one that's more
[1:34:44] worthy than anything even the Bible says
[1:34:46] the Lord your God is one there's no
[1:34:47] other God like God when Elijah was um
[1:34:52] was doing Miracles and he was was going
[1:34:54] against all denominations he told all of
[1:34:57] them to to call upon their gods nothing
[1:34:59] happened and Elijah maybe all he did was
[1:35:02] it was just the thought the moment the
[1:35:04] word was about to come that had the fire
[1:35:05] automatically Dro you see there's no God
[1:35:08] like our God out of every other gods
[1:35:11] there is that's right and if you pay
[1:35:13] attention he says fearfulness is is
[1:35:16] fearful in his praise the Lord God is
[1:35:18] fearful in his praise you see why
[1:35:21] because if you look at Jericho what
[1:35:22] brought down the wall it was wasn't
[1:35:24] people taking their sword and you know
[1:35:25] Hing on the wall or taking a hammer and
[1:35:28] you know what it wasn't someone that was
[1:35:30] like well you can go around the wall
[1:35:32] seven time as you're going around the
[1:35:33] wall I would just be chipping away over
[1:35:35] here making it wicker you know it wasn't
[1:35:37] that God told them to go around and
[1:35:39] after they went around God said Shout
[1:35:41] Scream give her praise there were
[1:35:42] praising the Lord worshiping the Lord
[1:35:44] and that worship is what brought fear
[1:35:46] brought the wall to come down you
[1:35:49] see verse 12 it says Thou thou stretches
[1:35:53] out thy right hand speak of that power
[1:35:55] again and watch what that power does the
[1:35:57] Earth swallowed them up you see that's
[1:36:00] the power of
[1:36:02] God thou in thou in in thy mercy has led
[1:36:07] forth the people which thou has redeemed
[1:36:09] has guided them in thy strength onto thy
[1:36:13] holy habitation see when I was reading
[1:36:16] this there was something that came that
[1:36:17] stru me because it said the people that
[1:36:19] you have redeemed and if you remember
[1:36:22] God redeemed us purchased us at the
[1:36:24] cross the price was already P was
[1:36:26] already paid at the cross and the
[1:36:28] scripture didn't stop there it said he's
[1:36:30] guiding Us by his strength to his holy
[1:36:34] habitation and he God God's holy
[1:36:36] habitation does not dwell in a place
[1:36:38] created by man but he dwells in a place
[1:36:41] that he himself created and God dwells
[1:36:43] in the seventh Dimension which is
[1:36:44] consist of the word brother brandham
[1:36:46] says it and it's God himself God is
[1:36:48] leading us to Heaven God is leading us
[1:36:50] to himself you see because he doesn't
[1:36:53] stop there says he's guiding Us by the
[1:36:54] strength and remember there's a word in
[1:36:56] the Bible that says God is the strength
[1:36:57] and God is the word that mean he's
[1:36:58] leading Us by his word that mean he
[1:37:01] purchased us purchasing us and he gave
[1:37:03] us a map and he said this is the place
[1:37:06] where you're going to go and God did not
[1:37:08] stop at just giving us a map to go to uh
[1:37:10] what's it called the place that he had
[1:37:13] um in store for us he didn't stop at
[1:37:16] that after he gave us the map he started
[1:37:18] talking us through on how to arrive at
[1:37:20] the destination because it says he's
[1:37:22] guiding Us by his strength you see he
[1:37:24] didn't stop at that he's also guiding us
[1:37:26] and leading us through the to arrive at
[1:37:28] our destination because that is God's
[1:37:30] role in this um war that we're going to
[1:37:33] am and if you go verse 14 says then
[1:37:38] people shall hear and be afraid sorrow
[1:37:41] shall take hold in the inhabitant of
[1:37:44] Palestine the only the people that are
[1:37:46] hearing and being afraid are the people
[1:37:47] that are not with God you see because if
[1:37:50] you're a child of God and after that
[1:37:51] you're reading certain scripture you're
[1:37:53] not going to be afraid because that's
[1:37:55] your God that's talking like if you're
[1:37:57] reading the book because I remember I
[1:37:58] was talking to a coworker my long time
[1:38:00] ago and because I love sharing the
[1:38:02] scripture and when I got to the Book of
[1:38:04] Revelation she was like I don't like I
[1:38:06] mean she didn't say she doesn't really
[1:38:07] like it but she said that book of
[1:38:08] Revelation scares her she said that book
[1:38:10] scares me how are you talking about it
[1:38:12] so lightly and and joyfully and I was
[1:38:15] like I'm talking about it so joyfully
[1:38:17] because it's literally the message of
[1:38:18] love the whole if you read about it God
[1:38:20] is coming he's even giving Grace onto
[1:38:23] his people even judgment is actually is
[1:38:25] the judgment is actually uh what's it
[1:38:27] called a Grace for the people that are
[1:38:29] not going to get raptured when I was
[1:38:31] reading at that it's it's a Grace for
[1:38:33] certain people you
[1:38:36] see and the only people that get scared
[1:38:39] of the word of God when the word of God
[1:38:41] is coming is people that are not in
[1:38:43] order with God it's people that are not
[1:38:45] a part of God you
[1:38:47] see and then it continues then the Dukes
[1:38:50] of Eden shall be amazed in the Mighty
[1:38:52] Man of Moab trembl Shake take shall take
[1:38:56] hold upon them all the inhabitants of
[1:38:59] Canaan shall Melt Away now in this verse
[1:39:03] fear and dread shall fall upon them by
[1:39:07] the greatness of thy arm they shall be
[1:39:11] as still as Stone till thy people pass
[1:39:15] over oh Lord till the people pass over
[1:39:19] which thou Hast purchased when I was
[1:39:21] reading this there was something that
[1:39:22] struck me and the thing that
[1:39:23] specifically struck me is the part where
[1:39:25] it says the greatness of thy arm they
[1:39:28] shall be as still as Stone till thy
[1:39:30] people pass over and when I was reading
[1:39:33] I was like this remind me of something
[1:39:35] this remind me of um of Revelation The
[1:39:39] Book of Revelation and that's this is
[1:39:43] actually the other part because when I
[1:39:44] was younger um I would read the Bible
[1:39:47] and I would do research on archangels
[1:39:51] and stuff right and sometime when I see
[1:39:53] this Archangel I see their description
[1:39:55] and all that and I'm like hm maybe when
[1:39:58] I get older I'll name my son this this
[1:39:59] and the third you know and but there was
[1:40:02] something specific that I noticed about
[1:40:04] Archangel Michael they said that he was
[1:40:05] the commander the commander of the army
[1:40:08] of the Lord you see and I was like
[1:40:10] that's cool that is very cool then one
[1:40:13] time I work with my boss when we were
[1:40:16] talking we're talking he told me that
[1:40:19] well there were Jehovah witnesses that
[1:40:21] says that Michael the Archangel Michael
[1:40:24] is Jesus and I was like H that's
[1:40:26] interesting then he was like I asked
[1:40:27] them for the scripture then they never
[1:40:29] gave me and I was like oh I never denied
[1:40:32] it I never accepted it but within the
[1:40:35] same week a minister came in and
[1:40:36] preached on Wednesday and mentioned
[1:40:39] Michael being Jesus Michael being Christ
[1:40:43] and I was like that's very interesting I
[1:40:45] said amen and then the following Sunday
[1:40:47] the pastor also mentions it I was like
[1:40:49] all right after service I went to the
[1:40:50] pastor I asked him well can you tell me
[1:40:52] how uh Christ is how Michael is Christ
[1:40:56] and the pastor asked me where did you
[1:40:57] hear that and I'm like you just preached
[1:40:59] about it and so instead of giving me the
[1:41:02] answer he just gave me the scriptures to
[1:41:04] go to and if you go to um if you go to
[1:41:08] Daniel chapter if you go to Daniel
[1:41:11] chapter
[1:41:13] 12 if you go to Daniel chapter 12 it
[1:41:16] says this and at that time shall Michael
[1:41:21] stand the great Prince which standed for
[1:41:24] the children of th people because
[1:41:26] everybody's familiar with the Battle of
[1:41:28] uh what's it called the battle that
[1:41:31] everybody's familiar whenever uh what's
[1:41:33] it called if you look online everything
[1:41:34] people would tell you Michael is the
[1:41:36] great angel that casted out Satan from
[1:41:40] Heaven you know that casted out Satan
[1:41:42] from Heaven you will have like pictures
[1:41:44] like these in movies and and and shows
[1:41:47] and everything and people are talking
[1:41:48] about how oh Michael is this great angel
[1:41:50] that casted out um Satan from heaven and
[1:41:53] some people would even go on and create
[1:41:55] stories and they're like well God was
[1:41:57] about to get up and you know fight fight
[1:41:59] the devil and after Michael told God no
[1:42:01] sit down I will take care of it whenever
[1:42:03] I hear that I'm like that makes no sense
[1:42:06] because God is I have never seen in the
[1:42:09] scripture where God his people are going
[1:42:11] through a trial and he just sits there I
[1:42:14] have never seen that so that never
[1:42:15] settled down with me and when they say
[1:42:17] oh Michael is the uh what's it called
[1:42:19] the commander-in chief and I'm like God
[1:42:21] is a jealous God why would he let
[1:42:22] someone be in charge of his people and
[1:42:25] as I as I was reading the
[1:42:27] scripture in uh Daniel chap 12:1 it says
[1:42:31] at that time shall Michael stand up the
[1:42:33] great Prince the only one that I know
[1:42:36] that's the prince of Prince the king of
[1:42:37] King is Jesus which standeth for the
[1:42:40] children of thy people and when I read
[1:42:43] that was like the only person that comes
[1:42:44] to mind that sto for the children of God
[1:42:48] is God himself right Jesus sto for the
[1:42:51] children of God he stole for them at
[1:42:52] Calvary he stole for them and defeated
[1:42:54] every type of sin possible it was Christ
[1:42:57] himself who stoed for the children of
[1:42:59] God that's what I got when I was reading
[1:43:01] that
[1:43:02] scripture and brother Brenham also said
[1:43:06] in beginning the be in beginning and
[1:43:09] ending of the Gentile dispensation and
[1:43:11] at that time Michael stand Michael shall
[1:43:14] stand the great Prince Michael was
[1:43:17] Christ of course who fought the Angelic
[1:43:21] Wars in heaven with the devil Satan and
[1:43:24] Michael fought together or fought
[1:43:26] against each other ra rather see when I
[1:43:29] was reading that and I was like um
[1:43:31] Michael Christ Michael is Christ Michael
[1:43:34] is uh representing Christ in in this
[1:43:37] battle that mean Christ was the one God
[1:43:39] himself was the one who actually casted
[1:43:41] Out the Devil because God will not sit
[1:43:43] down as you're going through a trial and
[1:43:45] just sit down and not do anything he
[1:43:48] also he's doing his part he wants you to
[1:43:49] do your part but he will also do his
[1:43:51] part he's not just going to stand there
[1:43:53] and people um going and causing chaos in
[1:43:56] your life without him doing
[1:43:58] anything and as as I was saying when I
[1:44:01] asked the uh Pastor I was like oh how is
[1:44:03] Christ uh Michael and stuff like that
[1:44:07] and he gave me the Book of Daniel and
[1:44:08] the Book of Revelation because both both
[1:44:10] those two books are parallel to each
[1:44:11] other and if you go to verse four it
[1:44:14] speaks about how Daniel was told to shut
[1:44:16] up the book and if you go to Revelation
[1:44:19] chapter 10 ver4 it also tells John just
[1:44:22] to close the book to seal up the book
[1:44:25] you see and if you go down to um to
[1:44:29] verse if you go down to
[1:44:33] um if you go down to verse uh five it
[1:44:39] says then I Daniel looked and behold
[1:44:41] there stood other two the one on one
[1:44:44] side in the of the bank the of the river
[1:44:47] and the other on the other side of the
[1:44:48] banker River and one said to the men
[1:44:51] clothed in linen which was upon the
[1:44:53] Waters of of the river how long shall it
[1:44:56] be to end these uh wonders and if you
[1:44:59] remember in also in
[1:45:02] Revelation he also speaks about how
[1:45:05] what's it called Christ the Revelation
[1:45:08] the angel that John me was also standing
[1:45:10] upon the water and he had one foot on
[1:45:12] the sea and one foot on the land and
[1:45:15] brother
[1:45:16] Brenham excuse me brother brenon has
[1:45:18] said I think I think of when Daniel was
[1:45:22] standing there on the banks on the on
[1:45:25] that when he was standing on the on um
[1:45:28] on the banks that day he saw the vision
[1:45:31] and the angel come down clothed in Sun a
[1:45:36] rainbow over his head he put one land
[1:45:40] had one for on the land one on the sea
[1:45:43] and raised up his hand and swore by him
[1:45:47] that lives forever and ever that time
[1:45:50] shall be no more you see that got to
[1:45:53] happen one of these day you see and I
[1:45:56] believe it's like happening this day
[1:45:58] right here because if you look at this
[1:46:01] two scripture I put it here to make it
[1:46:02] easier for comparison I'll try to save
[1:46:06] time by not reading too much but if you
[1:46:08] look at the two scripture in uh
[1:46:10] Revelation chapter 10 where say the
[1:46:12] angel which I saw stand upon the sea and
[1:46:15] upon the Earth lifted up his hand to
[1:46:20] Heaven see if you look at what's it
[1:46:22] called
[1:46:24] um scriptures they're like Puzzles
[1:46:27] you're going to find one piece of the
[1:46:28] puzzle here and after the other piece of
[1:46:30] the puzzle will be somewhere else and if
[1:46:32] you go back to verse 7 of Daniel 12 it
[1:46:34] says the man clothed in linen which was
[1:46:37] upon the waters of the river when when
[1:46:40] he held up his right hand and his left
[1:46:43] hand are to Heaven see one place it says
[1:46:46] one it doesn't say uh what's it called
[1:46:48] it seems like it says one hand the other
[1:46:49] scripture says both hand see it's like
[1:46:51] the puzzles that he showing you to to
[1:46:53] have the whole picture of Christ you see
[1:46:56] and as I was reading this because I will
[1:46:58] connect this back to our scripture that
[1:46:59] we're reading um in Exodus
[1:47:02] 15:6 as I was reading this it says one
[1:47:05] foot upon the sea and one foot upon the
[1:47:07] Earth and and when when you remember in
[1:47:12] uh what's it called if you go to
[1:47:14] Revelation chapter 13 if you remember
[1:47:16] there were the beast in
[1:47:18] verse chapter 13 verse1 the Beast that
[1:47:21] had came out the first Beast that had
[1:47:23] came out that brother Brenham say
[1:47:24] represented Rome and Rome had uh what's
[1:47:27] it called had the Antichrist spirit with
[1:47:31] him he had the spirits of denomination
[1:47:34] uh uh what's it called demonic Powers
[1:47:36] religious powers and
[1:47:39] um and political Powers you see because
[1:47:43] it says and I stood up I stood upon the
[1:47:46] sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up
[1:47:49] out of the sea having seven heads and 10
[1:47:51] horns horns representing powers and
[1:47:55] 10 and upon his horns 10 crowns which
[1:47:58] represent dominions and upon his heads
[1:48:01] the name blasphemy and if you drop down
[1:48:03] to verse 11 it says and beheld another
[1:48:06] Beast coming up out of the earth and he
[1:48:10] had two horns like a lamb and he spoke
[1:48:14] as a
[1:48:15] dragon and if you notice uh what's it
[1:48:18] called the two beast in the scripture he
[1:48:21] never said the two Beast uh what's it
[1:48:22] called
[1:48:23] it never said the second beast spoke
[1:48:25] with the
[1:48:26] dragon if you notice in the Scripture it
[1:48:28] never said this the second beast like
[1:48:30] spoke with the with the dragon and if
[1:48:32] you're reading with brother
[1:48:34] brandham brother brandham says here the
[1:48:37] Little Beast the lamb that come up out
[1:48:40] of the water out of water not thickness
[1:48:43] and multitudes of people not out of out
[1:48:46] of the water brother B is henting you
[1:48:49] that the multitudes of people is
[1:48:51] representing water water in the Bible
[1:48:52] represents the multitude of people
[1:48:54] brother br's hting it to you where
[1:48:56] there's no one I had two little horn
[1:49:00] civil and ecclesiastic powers and he was
[1:49:04] a lamb freedom of religion see he's
[1:49:08] canting on to you that the lamb the
[1:49:10] freedom of religion is the America
[1:49:12] because if you remember the America they
[1:49:13] say they believe in freedom of speech
[1:49:14] freedom of religion and Etc he's handing
[1:49:16] you that's that's America and after a
[1:49:19] while they went together and he spoke
[1:49:22] like the Dragon see this is talking
[1:49:24] about the second beast in the Scripture
[1:49:26] it doesn't say that the second beast met
[1:49:27] the dragon but you find here that the
[1:49:30] second beast and the first Beast as they
[1:49:32] were communing the second beast started
[1:49:34] to speak like the dragon that's why the
[1:49:36] word of God had came here many times and
[1:49:38] say you need to watch the company that
[1:49:40] you hang around with because the company
[1:49:42] that you're hanging around with have
[1:49:44] influence over your life you might be
[1:49:45] hanging around with people of the world
[1:49:47] and you think it's not going to affect
[1:49:49] you but at some point don't be shocked
[1:49:51] or surprised when you start speaking the
[1:49:53] language of the devil you see because
[1:49:55] you're hanging too close with people
[1:49:57] that are going contrary to the word of
[1:49:59] God you say well I will be all right but
[1:50:00] you're being unequally Yol you will
[1:50:02] notice at some point your language will
[1:50:04] start to change and you'll start
[1:50:06] mimicking them your language will start
[1:50:08] to change you'll start mimicking them
[1:50:09] you start following the way they dress
[1:50:10] you start following the way they talk
[1:50:12] you'll start following the way they even
[1:50:13] stare and look at certain things your
[1:50:15] interest and their interest will start
[1:50:17] to align and you will find yourself
[1:50:18] deviating away from God because brother
[1:50:21] brandom said once again this second
[1:50:23] beast never actually spoke with the
[1:50:24] dragon but we found over here that he's
[1:50:26] speaking as the dragon and we found out
[1:50:29] that the dragon had poured himself on
[1:50:31] the first Beast you see now by the
[1:50:33] second beast and the first Beast having
[1:50:35] Fellowship both of them became one they
[1:50:38] were one Accord you see and brother
[1:50:41] Brandon continues and
[1:50:44] says he spoke like the dragon and
[1:50:47] exercised all the power that Rome did
[1:50:50] before him see when your hanging around
[1:50:53] certain people you will also start
[1:50:54] acting like them so don't be surprised
[1:50:56] when you're acting like them why because
[1:50:58] the company that you carry the company
[1:50:59] that you hang around you see sometime
[1:51:01] parents are asking themselves they they
[1:51:03] raise their child in the in the fear of
[1:51:05] the Lord and after the child goes to
[1:51:06] school and after the child comes home
[1:51:08] and after the child isn't acting right
[1:51:10] and sometime it's not even the parents
[1:51:12] uh what's it called the parents fault
[1:51:13] it's the company that they're meeting at
[1:51:15] school the company that they're hanging
[1:51:17] around the little friend groups that
[1:51:19] they're creating you
[1:51:20] see and the prophet continues that's
[1:51:24] coming to our nation to mark it down you
[1:51:28] watch to the confederation of the
[1:51:30] churches and the Catholic unit unite
[1:51:32] together and watch that take
[1:51:34] place people who follow the pillar of
[1:51:38] fire will certainly have a rough time
[1:51:41] see brother brandham didn't say
[1:51:44] um brother brandham didn't said that oh
[1:51:47] a Christian's life is easy Jesus also
[1:51:50] never said a Christian's life is easy he
[1:51:52] said there will be people that will
[1:51:54] persecute you they will hate you because
[1:51:55] of Christ and brother brenon is also
[1:51:57] saying that Christians will have a rough
[1:51:59] time you see Christians will have a
[1:52:01] rough time but and he proceeds says but
[1:52:04] they're ready they're ready for
[1:52:05] translation at that time that's right
[1:52:08] it's just ready although you're going
[1:52:10] through a rough time because we're in
[1:52:11] the last age and where everything it's
[1:52:13] hard everything even even the third
[1:52:16] world war is right around the corner you
[1:52:17] don't know when it's going to hit you
[1:52:18] see we're going through a rough time and
[1:52:20] the bride is ready if you're not ready
[1:52:22] you need to get ready soon because the
[1:52:24] Rapture is around is right around the
[1:52:26] corner you see brother Brenham continues
[1:52:29] and he says for the lamb overcome them
[1:52:31] see the lamb overcome them said the
[1:52:34] Bible and them that followed him because
[1:52:37] they were called The Chosen and the
[1:52:40] faithful and the elected of God see
[1:52:44] because God who overcame them God he
[1:52:47] already uh conquered he he did all that
[1:52:50] he needed to do in Calvary he displayed
[1:52:53] and showed you when God came down he
[1:52:55] came down to demonstrate how he can
[1:52:57] overcome sin and how you can overcome
[1:53:00] sin because if God overcame sin as as uh
[1:53:04] the in his divine nature you would say
[1:53:07] well he is God you know I can't do that
[1:53:09] because he's God see I'm in flesh I
[1:53:11] bleed God doesn't bleed so God came down
[1:53:14] as a human to bleed and to show you that
[1:53:17] even though you're bleeding you can
[1:53:18] still overcome you see even though
[1:53:21] you're going through some trials and
[1:53:22] even though you might fall even though
[1:53:24] you might sleep but you need to wake up
[1:53:26] and when you wake up you have to speak
[1:53:28] the word you see you can't just be
[1:53:29] sleeping
[1:53:31] forever and I
[1:53:35] want and I want to bring this back to
[1:53:37] where we were reading in Exodus chapter
[1:53:39] 15 verse 16 because if you go back to
[1:53:42] that where it says fear fear and dread
[1:53:46] shall fall upon them by the greatness of
[1:53:49] thy arm they shall they shall be as
[1:53:52] still as Stone see God is holding the
[1:53:55] powers you see God is holding the powers
[1:53:58] that's why they're still as Stone
[1:54:00] they're still a stone because God is
[1:54:01] holding them down so you can pass
[1:54:03] through you see if you remember earlier
[1:54:06] God has purchased us he had already paid
[1:54:08] the price that mean he he purchased the
[1:54:11] map he gave us the map he didn't stop by
[1:54:13] just giving us the map after he gave us
[1:54:15] the map he also led us he's guiding us
[1:54:17] to go to the destination and he didn't
[1:54:20] just stop at guiding us so we can arrive
[1:54:22] at their destination God also gave God
[1:54:26] also um after purchasing the map after
[1:54:29] guiding us so we can arrive at the
[1:54:31] destination he's also holding down the
[1:54:33] forces so they will not harm us kind of
[1:54:36] how job when job was going through his
[1:54:38] trials God was holding the devil he said
[1:54:41] he can touch everything but do not touch
[1:54:43] job's Soul do not go and touch that part
[1:54:45] God is holding the devil alth they're
[1:54:47] attacking they will not reach you
[1:54:49] although they're fighting as hard as
[1:54:51] they can all they can do is bark but
[1:54:52] they can't really bite
[1:54:58] you and and he proceeds Thou shalt bring
[1:55:02] them in and plant them in the mountain
[1:55:04] see it's God who's bringing you in and
[1:55:06] planting you in the mountain of your
[1:55:08] inheritance it's God who's guiding you
[1:55:10] remember it's arise soldiers of of the
[1:55:14] Cross God's ro we're talking about God's
[1:55:17] position in this journey God's God's
[1:55:20] Divine position in this journey and how
[1:55:22] he's helping us get through
[1:55:26] it and in verse 17 said Thou shalt bring
[1:55:29] them in and plant them in the mountain
[1:55:31] of thy inheritance in the place oh Lord
[1:55:34] which thou has made for thee to dwell in
[1:55:37] the sanctuary oh Lord which thy hands
[1:55:40] have established remember God does not
[1:55:42] dwell in a man-made building he dwelt in
[1:55:45] his own building that he built which
[1:55:47] Heaven is consist of the word that he
[1:55:49] built it by the word it's him himself
[1:55:52] brother BR say heaven is himself and God
[1:55:54] is bringing us to him he's guiding us to
[1:55:56] go into him and become one with him
[1:55:59] that's why in Revelation when people go
[1:56:01] in you go into the sea you go into the
[1:56:03] throne and after you disappear because
[1:56:05] you go into that realm of God you go
[1:56:07] into that reality of God you going to
[1:56:08] your your destination your
[1:56:12] inheritance and in verse 18 the the Lord
[1:56:16] shall reign forever and ever see it's
[1:56:18] the Lord because it's God's road for the
[1:56:21] horse of of pharaoh went went in with
[1:56:25] his chariots and with his Horsemen into
[1:56:29] the sea and the Lord brought them
[1:56:31] brought again the Waters of the sea upon
[1:56:34] them but the children of Israel went on
[1:56:37] dry land in the midst of the sea you see
[1:56:39] when all this um destruction are
[1:56:42] happening where all all your enemies are

[1:58:36] you and I'll just read this scripture uh
[1:58:40] I'll read this verse from Brother
[1:58:42] brandham as like a closer because I know
[1:58:44] I can't get to the part where where I
[1:58:47] talk about all R because there's a lot
[1:58:50] but I want to close with this one if you
[1:58:52] couldn't catch anything that was spoken
[1:58:54] but I want you at least remember this
[1:58:55] one brother Brenham said and stand still
[1:58:57] and see the salvation of the Lord 1957
[1:59:01] paragraph 28 29 he says it's not your
[1:59:04] battle just stand still remember it's
[1:59:07] just stand still it's God's battle don't
[1:59:10] be flustered that mean don't be agitated
[1:59:13] don't be quick
[1:59:14] to excuse me don't be quick to get mad
[1:59:17] to to feel like quitting just because
[1:59:19] stuff are going um it's not going
[1:59:21] according to your plan just stand still
[1:59:24] and listen to
[1:59:25] God don't be upset brother bham says
[1:59:28] stand still we're living in a tremendous
[1:59:32] time as we're living in a tremendous
[1:59:34] time right now we're living in a great
[1:59:37] time the church should stand still now
[1:59:41] to receive the promise see the promise
[1:59:43] of God is coming left and right and for
[1:59:46] you to to receive it is the prophet is
[1:59:48] saying stand still to receive the
[1:59:50] promise of God because the promise is
[1:59:52] already yours God promised it to you
[1:59:54] that you don't even have to work hard to
[1:59:56] achieve or to receive that promise that
[1:59:58] God already gave onto you you see it
[2:00:00] says stand still and watch the glory of
[2:00:03] God he's not the I was he's not that I
[2:00:07] was he is the I am he is the same he
[2:00:12] will just stand still as they did the I
[2:00:16] am the same that I am lives
[2:00:19] tonight see the I Am which is God
[2:00:22] because I am means Jehovah je Jehovah
[2:00:25] which Jehovah also means I'm becoming
[2:00:26] because he is he is the same yesterday
[2:00:29] today and forever and the I am is the
[2:00:31] present since we're speaking about today
[2:00:32] we're speaking about our time God is
[2:00:34] still the same now just stand still if
[2:00:36] you're facing a trial you're facing
[2:00:37] something just stand still and wait upon
[2:00:39] the Lord you see I remember even me when
[2:00:43] when uh when I meditate usually I
[2:00:45] meditate on let's say before the pastor
[2:00:48] asked me to preach sometime when I'm
[2:00:50] walking and God give me like a subject
[2:00:53] and I'm like all right I will meditate
[2:00:55] upon this and as I meditate upon this
[2:00:57] God will give me um inspiration and
[2:00:59] stuff and I will drop drop it down drop
[2:01:01] it down drop it down write it down and
[2:01:03] sometime when the pastor calls me not
[2:01:05] sometime like almost every time when the
[2:01:06] pastor calls me and says oh you're going
[2:01:08] to preach it's like as the time arrives
[2:01:11] for me to preach it's almost like if the
[2:01:12] devil tries to attack me and I try to
[2:01:14] look at my notes I'm like I took all
[2:01:16] these not I I don't even know how these
[2:01:18] notes fit in together I'm looking at I'm
[2:01:21] like Lord God I feel like quitting
[2:01:22] sometime but then I remember I wasn't
[2:01:25] the person who came up with the
[2:01:26] inspiration for this God who had given
[2:01:29] me that inspiration so what I proceed to
[2:01:31] do is I I end up standing still sometime
[2:01:34] I'd go to the car and be in my bedroom
[2:01:35] and I would just meditate upon what he
[2:01:37] gave me I said Lord God you inspired you
[2:01:40] gave this inspiration to me uh when you
[2:01:42] gave it to me they were good they made
[2:01:44] me happy I was happy as I was studying
[2:01:47] but now it's time for me to organize
[2:01:49] them to give it to your bride please
[2:01:52] help me organize it for your
[2:01:54] bride and when I keep that mentality of
[2:01:56] standing still and waiting upon the Lord
[2:01:58] the Lord start telling me put this here
[2:02:00] put this here put this there put this
[2:02:02] here put this here put this there and my
[2:02:04] message to you is you're a soldier of
[2:02:06] God and
[2:02:08] you as you're going through your battles
[2:02:11] just rely upon the Lord stand still rely
[2:02:13] upon the Lord because it's God's role
[2:02:15] it's God who's doing God who's working
[2:02:17] through you he's the one who started the
[2:02:20] work of Faith he's the one who started R
[2:02:22] of Faith he's the one who started and
[2:02:23] he's the one who's going to finish it
[2:02:24] for he is the arthor and he is the he is
[2:02:26] the finisher of our faith you see God
[2:02:28] purchased us and he bought the map gave
[2:02:31] us the map and he didn't stop at just
[2:02:33] giving us the map he he also uh led us
[2:02:37] he started guiding us showing us the
[2:02:39] marks in the map saying this this this
[2:02:42] this go here go there go left and when
[2:02:44] you want to try to go right he says no
[2:02:46] no go left maybe you're praying to go um
[2:02:49] right and God is telling you no go left
[2:02:51] you see because sometime we pray and we
[2:02:52] want to go a certain direction God
[2:02:53] changes our Direction you see God is
[2:02:56] telling you just follow through
[2:02:57] obedience you're following through
[2:02:58] obedience and as you're following
[2:02:59] through obedience God is holding down
[2:03:01] the forces from completely taking you
[2:03:04] out and he's bringing you to his holy
[2:03:07] habitation which is him himself he's
[2:03:09] bringing you back to him to the Glorious
[2:03:12] um marriage of the
[2:03:14] Bride may the Lord God bless you all

[2:06:25] praise God Amen am Glory Glory Glory
[2:06:31] Glory to God you got something to go
[2:06:34] about at at home amen watch your
[2:06:37] fellowship watch who you hanging around
[2:06:39] with amen remember this battle this
[2:06:43] journey is of god amen amen God is the
[2:06:47] one who started the journey he's the one
[2:06:49] that is protecting us he's the one
[2:06:51] leading us holding all the power of the
[2:06:54] devil until we make it to the other side
[2:06:57] can you give me five minutes yes sir
[2:07:00] amen I know there was something that was
[2:07:03] spoken here but I want to help somebody
[2:07:06] can you give me five
[2:07:07] minute if you recall I gave you a key on
[2:07:11] Sunday maybe couple Sunday ago and I
[2:07:14] mentioned that uh this is a great key
[2:07:18] and I say that probably you won't even
[2:07:21] understand it now but as you move on you
[2:07:24] will begin to understand this little by
[2:07:27] little amen he preached good so just
[2:07:29] focus on me this is something as a
[2:07:32] pastor I'm speaking and I told you that
[2:07:34] the scripture have no
[2:07:37] contradiction and I say whenever you see
[2:07:39] a scripture like it's contradicting each
[2:07:41] other there's usually a strong
[2:07:44] Revelation that is hidden there and I
[2:07:47] say the same thing apply for the message
[2:07:49] of br br the message has no
[2:07:52] contradiction brother Bram says that man
[2:07:56] was the third person of the Trinity not
[2:07:59] the Holy Spirit but man are we together
[2:08:03] and brother Bram later on say that the
[2:08:05] word Trinity is not even in the
[2:08:09] Bible sir are we together so here
[2:08:12] brother Bram is saying something here
[2:08:13] brother Bram is saying something brother
[2:08:15] Bram is not contradicting itself there
[2:08:18] is only one God and his name is the Lord
[2:08:21] Jesus Christ here oh Israel the Lord
[2:08:24] your God is how many God and brother
[2:08:26] Bram say when we speak about Father Son
[2:08:29] and Holy Ghost these are offices of one
[2:08:32] God Amen so God when he was dealing with
[2:08:36] Israel in the Old Testament that was the
[2:08:39] office of the father then when God was D
[2:08:43] I mean was pour into Jesus Christ God
[2:08:46] now became a son he became Emmanuel I
[2:08:49] even explained it here on the board
[2:08:51] Emmanuel which mean God with us but when
[2:08:55] God leave because said that everything
[2:08:58] that was in God he poured that into
[2:09:00] Christ in the second office not the
[2:09:03] second person the second office then
[2:09:06] everything that was in the second office
[2:09:09] when the ministry was finished he poured
[2:09:11] that back again into the Brad which is
[2:09:14] the church and it started on the day of
[2:09:17] Pentecost are we together so now I'm
[2:09:19] going to reread that quote again in case
[2:09:22] someone has a question brother Bram says
[2:09:25] this and that I gave it to you and show
[2:09:27] us the father brother Bram say and then
[2:09:29] he says there is no man to te the soil
[2:09:32] so he created men out of the dark
[2:09:35] brother bam is talking about
[2:09:36] men he created man he's not talking
[2:09:39] about the Holy Spirit he's talking about
[2:09:41] man the human being Adam and then and
[2:09:44] then he say and then he created man Out
[2:09:47] of the Dust of the earth that was Adam
[2:09:50] now he might have given a hand like a
[2:09:51] monkey and a foot like a bear I don't
[2:09:54] know what he did but he put him in five
[2:09:57] senses and he put this supernatural
[2:10:01] being which was called man the third
[2:10:05] person of the
[2:10:08] Trinity so it is not the Holy Spirit who
[2:10:12] is the third person of the
[2:10:14] trinity in other word because we need to
[2:10:17] understand what Bram Me Trinity is not
[2:10:20] in the Bible Trinity comes from Catholic
[2:10:23] Trinity is a false Doctrine but brother
[2:10:26] Bram is making a point if not you will
[2:10:30] miss the Revelation the Revelation is
[2:10:33] not that we believe in Trinity no the
[2:10:35] Revelation is what is brother Braham
[2:10:38] trying to say because brother Braham say
[2:10:41] take me for a dment get what I was
[2:10:44] trying to say because when he was the
[2:10:46] father that was God above us when he was
[2:10:49] the son it was Jesus Christ himself
[2:10:52] that's why Jesus say it is expedient for
[2:10:55] me to go because as long as I'm staying
[2:10:58] here I'm the one doing almost everything
[2:11:01] amen but in the third office Amen in the
[2:11:05] third office the manifestation of the
[2:11:08] holy spirit that doesn't belong to Jesus
[2:11:12] Christ it belong to the bride which is
[2:11:16] many members body in other word when
[2:11:19] brother Bram is saying man is the third
[2:11:21] person brother Bram is telling us that
[2:11:24] the third office of God the third
[2:11:27] manifestation of God into this world is
[2:11:30] going to be in human being which is the
[2:11:33] bre of Jesus Christ so Trinity is not in
[2:11:37] the Bible Trinity is a Catholic word but
[2:11:41] brother Bram is trying to make a point
[2:11:43] here to make us understand that at the
[2:11:46] beginning he was God the pillar of fire
[2:11:49] one day God became became flesh in one
[2:11:52] man now God is made flesh not in one man
[2:11:56] I gave you the quote in the unveiling of
[2:11:58] God he said in Jesus Christ is was God
[2:12:01] in one man now it's God in many men that
[2:12:04] third manifestation sir this is what
[2:12:07] brother brandham is calling the third
[2:12:10] person of the Trinity because the
[2:12:13] trouble in the message we argue in
[2:12:16] terms but we don't see the thoughts
[2:12:19] behind the term when I'm reading the
[2:12:22] third manifest the third person of the
[2:12:25] Trinity I already know that we don't
[2:12:27] believe in Trinity I already know that
[2:12:29] brother brandham doesn't believe in
[2:12:31] Trinity I already know that if somebody
[2:12:33] is a PhD in this message that understand
[2:12:36] the D of Jesus Christ is message
[2:12:39] believer I already understand that God
[2:12:41] is one God but I'm trying to catch what
[2:12:44] is the prophet saying why is God why is
[2:12:47] the prophet calling man the third person
[2:12:50] of a trinity is God is Man and another
[2:12:53] person in the Trinity so we have this
[2:12:55] this this no it is the same God he was
[2:12:59] the father above us now he became God in
[2:13:02] Jesus Christ now in his third office his
[2:13:06] third
[2:13:07] manifestation he is now God working in
[2:13:11] man so the Holy Spirit it is not the the
[2:13:15] third person of the Trinity that is
[2:13:18] heathenism that is caring God in pieces
[2:13:22] are we together so when you read brother
[2:13:24] Bram he might use one term here one term
[2:13:27] there there is no contradiction in the
[2:13:30] message read between the line because if
[2:13:34] this message is so plain that everybody
[2:13:37] can catch it the devil will catch the
[2:13:40] message but God sometime does brother
[2:13:43] Bram say God Jesus was speaking things
[2:13:47] purposely to make other people go
[2:13:54] that's why when you get in the crazy
[2:13:55] website they will try to show you
[2:13:57] brother Bram contradicting himself
[2:14:00] because they thought brother brandham
[2:14:01] was contradicting himself brother
[2:14:03] brandham was not contradicting himself
[2:14:05] God made it so that whoever is not
[2:14:08] predestinated for this message can go
[2:14:12] but if you a predestinated seed even if
[2:14:14] somebody trouble you one day the light
[2:14:17] will strike you and you will look around
[2:14:20] you say wait a minute these people were
[2:14:22] lying these people on the internet were
[2:14:24] lying now I see the light that's why we
[2:14:26] don't lose hope for our children we know
[2:14:29] that one of these day all it takes is
[2:14:31] for God to shine the light and before
[2:14:33] you know it they see it and they can
[2:14:35] understand but it's normal for you to go
[2:14:38] through the message and you see one
[2:14:40] thing here and one thing on the other
[2:14:42] way you see one thing before 63 one
[2:14:44] thing after 63 I heard people talking
[2:14:46] about marriage and divorce I can take
[2:14:48] marriage and divorce from before 63 and
[2:14:51] tired all the way to
[2:14:53] 65 sir because the way they say Okay
[2:14:56] marriage and divorce is in 65 this is
[2:14:58] the best marriage and divorce and they
[2:15:00] throw every other coat away no you don't
[2:15:02] understand the message before I get to
[2:15:04] 65 because the message was coming in
[2:15:07] progression I need to start from there
[2:15:09] and get everything and put it
[2:15:12] together the way somebody asked me say
[2:15:15] how do you study the message I say the
[2:15:17] way I study the message if I see a
[2:15:20] subject with brother brandham yeah and
[2:15:22] brother brandham say something I will go
[2:15:24] into the message and kill it yeah you
[2:15:27] won't believe this but I'm going to tell
[2:15:28] you and sometime it comes up like
[2:15:31] 2,500
[2:15:34] quotes what do you think your pastor do
[2:15:37] does do you know what I do it takes me
[2:15:40] three to four days I have to go to every
[2:15:43] single one of them I told the minister
[2:15:46] he said but stepen I cannot do that I
[2:15:47] said that's you but me I'm built that
[2:15:50] way sometime you hit it and it's going
[2:15:52] to be 4,000 and I have to go through
[2:15:55] 4,000 quot maybe might take me a week I
[2:15:58] have to go one after the other then I
[2:16:00] pull all of them together then I sit
[2:16:03] down to see why is brother brandham
[2:16:05] giving all of this then I can pull it
[2:16:07] together when we were in the ComEd when
[2:16:09] the brother were talking I said did you
[2:16:11] read it in the message I said did you
[2:16:13] read the Cote about oh no no no no no uh
[2:16:16] what was it it was like an entering
[2:16:17] Pastor I said show me one coat I say I
[2:16:20] read this through the message I sat with
[2:16:23] more than a thousand code I didn't see
[2:16:25] anything like this why because the
[2:16:27] message was put in a strategic way so
[2:16:30] that the seed of the devil cannot see so
[2:16:33] when I read Trinity I know Trinity is of
[2:16:36] Satan I Trinity came from the devil I
[2:16:39] know Trinity came from the Catholic
[2:16:41] church and I see here a revelation
[2:16:43] hidden and brother Bram take the word
[2:16:45] Trinity and put it there so when I look
[2:16:48] I just take Trinity and I flip it up
[2:16:51] and I enter under I say this is not
[2:16:54] Trinity he's talking about men being in
[2:16:57] the office of the holy spirit because
[2:17:00] it's now God working in men any question
