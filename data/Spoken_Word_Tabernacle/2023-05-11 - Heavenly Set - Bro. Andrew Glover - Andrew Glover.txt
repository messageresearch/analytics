do we have here tonight remember he is here thankful to not to know that he's here because if we were here by ourselves we have gathered in vain but if he is here then all things are possible amen it meant to think that God would send us a prophet in this generation that would declare one thing to us he is here amen he says my Ministry is different from the pastor different from the Evangelist he said my Ministry is to declare him that he is here and I I was just hearing a quote today the prophet of God said we've gone beyond all these uh things of trying to speak in tongues and trying to shout and trying to dance he said we believe in those things but we've come to the hour where the word and the word alone amen the word itself divine presence and I I'm thankful to know tonight that we are in the presence amen of the word amen we want to say God bless you all this evening and we sure appreciate mother Stephen we appreciate the opportunity and the invitation to be here and he had asked us some time ago about coming and I wasn't able to come then and the other day you text us out of the clear blue and I realized I never got back with him and it was my fault and so we thank the Lord that he allowed it to work out out we could be here this evening with you and I sure sure appreciate brother Stephen and this church and the stand that you've taken for this message amen and we just pray the Lord bless you richly we bring greetings tonight from our pastor brother Sean Martin all the saints there Faith Tabernacle in Virginia I send the greetings to you and we've just come out of our annual camp meeting there and we saw some of you all there with us and we sure appreciated those that were able to come and we were encouraged by you coming and fellowshipping with us and we sure thank you for that and we also want to say real good to have our in-laws here this evening God bless you all and last time I was here everybody was asking about Malachi so he's here this time amen we're sure thankful to have them here with us and for sure sure love and appreciate our family my wife made the trip down with us and be traveling back tonight so we we sure appreciate her for coming and let's just buy our hearts together here for a word of prayer and let's just invite him to come tonight and speak to his Heavenly Father Lord as your Believers have together here this afternoon Lord we come for one Purpose with one motive and one objective and Lord that is to lift up the name that is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow every tongue should confess Lord father at that name ever Spirit has to come subject Lord to the Holy Spirit if that name Lord sicknesses leave bodies Lord destructions and and strongholds have to leave the minds of your children at the name of Jesus so Lord we've come here tonight to do one thing and that is Lord just to speak the name of Jesus father I pray that as your word Goes Forth as we fill the angels of God in this building Lord as the songs of Zion have been sung to create an atmosphere that would be conducive for your spirit to come and to position your word into the hearts of your children now Lord I Surrender myself as Speaker Lord may they surrender his hearers father and Lord may you speak through me may you hear through the Believers Lord may it be another emmausical God may it not be as brother Andrew spoke to us along the way but father may it be as you come and talk to us along the way Lord we invite you come in the little room tonight oh God take the bread and break it that the children's house would come open and see that you're still the same yesterday today and forever and whatever is accomplished here tonight we'll be sure to give thee all the praise all the honor and all the glory for it to do thy Wonderful Name the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers says amen and amen the book of Ephesians the second chapter we want to look here in Ephesians the second chapter and we just have something here on our heart tonight to share with you a bit of a study I've been studying through and preaching a little bit on so I trust it'd be okay to bring a few things from it to you tonight in the book of Ephesians the second chapter we want to look in the fourth verse Ephesians 2 and verse 4 Paul here writing says but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love we're with he loved us that even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by Grace ye are saved now watch this sixth verse and hath raised us up together amen hath not not left us where we were but has raised us up together and has made us to sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace and his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus so Paul was not just speaking to the Ephesians but he was actually showing in the ages to come that he would actually be showing the same benefits to the church that he was showing to the Ephesians now in the book of Colossians the third chapter I want to pull a couple verses from Colossians 3 and verse 1 again Paul writing and he's speaking of a holy ambition a holy affection and I believe that's what we want tonight is a holy ambition and a holy affection in the first verse Paul says if you then be risen with Christ then seek those things which are above where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God and set your affection on things above and not on things on the earth so Paul's changing your attention from the things of the Earth to the things of Heaven for ye are dead and you are in your life is hid with Christ in God and when Christ who is our life shall appear then we shall also appear with him in glory amen we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can be seated here this afternoon I want to for just a few moments to speak to you tonight and if I title this sermon I want to speak to you on two words Heavenly set Heavenly set s-e-t Heavenly said I I believe that this women is not the hour to be drifting but I believe this is the hour to be set I don't believe this is the hour to be aimlessly wandering through life but I believe this is the hour to have a focus to have a have a vision to have a goal to have a direction amen I believe this is the hour to set our Spirits now the problem of God presuming 1962 he said I put my choice with the Full Gospel many years ago and I'm happier every day about it I'm thankful to be one of them how many can say you're thankful to be one of them and having this Grand experience of receiving Christ is my savior and then returns having him to fill me with this Holy Spirit and living in my heart daily as a witness to me that I have passed from deafen to life testing my plant of my salvation each day as I take inventory see just the way the spirit in me what does it feel like how does it cooperate with the things of the world or is it so Heavenly Sent till the world seems dull and dingy and dirty amen is our spirit so Heavenly Sent Amen to the things of the world sing dull they seem dingy and they seem dirty again in the junction of time brother I'm speaking of Noah he said he was not only performing a miracle but he was also looking for a miracle and the church today is it's a labored away into the task of preaching the gospel with signs and wonders of following they are preparing for a miracle that Miracle is the rapture of the church and the going home amen the miracle the church is preparing for is the rapture and the going home it is preparing people getting them light and burden from the things of the world and getting their soul set in the presence of God that when Jesus does appear and then the second time in glory those who are ready will Rapture and be caught up together to meet him in the air and be with him amen we got to get our spirit sent amen we've got to get our soul saved amen can I give you some prophetic instructions from a prophet prophet he said it behooves us to watch and to be careful Amen to be set in the word amen this is the hour to be sent in the word amen many things are taking place today which are unscriptural amen let's watch the scripture and let's be sure that we are right again he said don't be tossed about with every wind of Doctrine amen you believe God's word you get stable and you get set and then listen there's many things happening today amen but this is not the hour to be following every new idea that comes along this is not the hour to be fallen every new move that comes along amen but God who is rich in Mercy has sent a message in this generation and I propose to you that this message is not a feeling it is not a sensation it is not a Doctrine it is not a religion amen but it is the presence of the resurrected Christ they've been returning into the church with power and with authoritative amen it behooves us tonight's hers to look away to Jesus it behooves us tonight amen to turn our attention from the things that's going on around us amen and set our Focus towards heaven amen don't be tossed about amen don't move one day and end the next but get stable amen get set amen because the Rapture is upon the church amen when I think of this word Heavenly Webster says it is relating to Heaven or the heavens amen it means divine it is meaning the suggesting the Blessed state of heaven so in other words the Bible said that Jesus give us the model prayer when he said you pray this way father let thy kingdom come and let thy will be done on the Earth as it is in heaven amen when Jesus prayed bad amen you were not already on the other side amen but you were still on this Earthly side amen but he was saying amen that the will of heaven will come into the Earth and before the people get to heaven they will be manifest thing the attribute of Heaven amen listen without this message we're another Baptist Church Without this message we're another charismatic Catherine amen but if this is the message of Malachi 4 and Revelation 10 and Luke 17 and I believe it is amen that we have received a Heavenly message upon an Earthly people amen and this message is changing us whether it's doing more than just changing the way we dress it's doing more than just changing the way we sing amen but it has changed our Focus amen from the things of the earth and to the things of Heaven they said I'm not looking at the government I'm not looking at the White House I'm looking at the right hand of God where there is a victorious conqueror who sits on the seat [Music] he's not sitting there nervous he's not sitting there confused he is sitting there as a mighty God he is sitting there as the Everlasting father and there is a people on the Earth who is manifesting heaven right now well glory to God I tell you what I am one that believes we don't have to die and go to heaven to enjoy heaven I am one that's not waiting to get to heaven before I enjoy Heaven amen but this message has put me in position on a Wednesday night in the house of God Amen to enjoy their benefits this is not an Earthly message this is not a churchy message this is a Heavenly message with a Heavenly influence and the prophet of God said when a heavily influence comes in the church he said it paralyzes every demon but you know what every demon against you tonight amen is paralyzed in the atmosphere of the message of the hour because this message is not a feeling it's a versa the lord it's a scriptural message it's a Vindicated message it's a message of authority it's a message of Direction [Applause] it's a message from heaven amen it's a message from Heaven the prophet of God one of his final sermons he preaches is things that are to be beautiful message go listen to it things are to be he said I do not think that heaven is a place my mother used to tell me about he said I believe the church has grown from that he said the old-timers used to say you go to heaven sit on a cloud and play a harp he said but it isn't playing Harps at all he said I don't believe the Bible teaches that amen that was the conception they had amen before the fullness of the word he said come into existence amen or the opening of The Seven seal that promised to us in this age amen that we would understand among church amen I feel like preaching amen this message amen is the only message that has accurately ain't been described what heaven is my bones hurt I know there's a lot of books I know there's a lot of teachers that teach what heaven is amen but the problem with those things is brother Stephen the things they say they saw there it's not what the Bible says will be there like like a like a man said one time he said I died and went to heaven and he saw he said I saw my 80 year old mother sitting on the porch I thought 80 year old mother amen when we get over there old age will be done away with amen but God who is rich in Mercy was not allowing you to walk to this earth he'd been confused about your destination so he let a prophet go beyond the curtain of time amen and catch a glimpse of the things that are to me listen amen we are not a helpless hopeless confused amen but your church members we are the Bride of Jesus Christ and we have been notified by the message of The Hour That Heaven is a real place I say thank God for the message amen that changed our conception of what heaven is for what it really is yeah it's a real place amen it's a real place see for God started Us in her spiritual growth in this place now watch this God started us in our spiritual growth in this place he said but watch believe that heaven is a real place we don't set up fair for eternity and just sit there on a cloud so Heaven is a real place and this message has accurately described to you the place you're going than what this message has done is it's a Divine message it's a Heavenly message that has set our focus on our destination [Applause] that's why you can't stop us amen that's why the devil can't discourage us and then that's why troubles and situations amen cannot back us off of the promises of God because our conception of our future has been changed by the verse of the seventh angel and that we are not hopelessly aimlessly walking through life we can see where we come from we can see where we're at we can see where we're going oh I wish I had the voice of a Thousand Angels I would climb upon the tallest mountain and scream thank God for the message of the hour Amen to open our eyes Hallelujah I think it's time to remember God sent a message he didn't send a personality he didn't send a bunch of famous preachers he sent a message and if you want to escape the destruction that is coming upon the Earth you better get in the message brother all right I know what I'm talking about amen personalities come and personality goes preachers come and preachers go we've seen all kinds of moves in this message amen but I'll tell you one thing the message of the hour Still Remains [Applause] the message of the hour Still Remains pure Still Remains undiluted now I'm just gonna go ahead and preach since I'm here don't you reduce this message down to just some feeling or some gift or some sensation this message is the power to overcome two hundred thousand thousand Devils this message amen is the ability to equip a pride when the incremental counsel is present and the World Council churches are gathering we have seen the uniting time we have seen the uniting sign our eyes have been turned you say preacher you're a little different I say I am because of the message change my conception it changed the way I conduct myself I no longer conduct myself as a helpless hopeless church member I now conduct myself as a messiah and if you ever get in the message it'll change the way you conduct yourself well glory to God it feels good in here don't it and then if you ever get the message it'll change the way you conduct yourself it'll change the way you talk about people it'll change the way you come to church it'll change the way you say Amen listen there's nothing else on the earth to change us but the message of the hour it's a Heavenly message and those that are following this heavenly message they have become Heavenly Sent they have become Heavenly Sent they say they become heavily set with everything within me I declare we are set towards heaven now that little word said it's it's a little word but it packs a powerful definition it means to put layers stand something in a specified place or position it means to be situated or fixed in a specified place or position it means to put a seed or plant in the ground to grow it means to put a sail up in position to catch the wind it means to call someone or something to start doing something it means to instruct someone to do something it means to give someone a task it means of a blossom or a tree it means to develop into or produce fruit so when you receive this heavenly message it will literally situate you and will fix you in a position they meant to catch a wind From Another Dimension to raise up above the dimension that you're in right now now I know where I'm at I'm in the adoption series part one brother remember says that brother man stops and reads Ephesians 1 3 and says spiritual blessings in Heavenly places he said now this brother Stephen I love it he said we are heavenlies in our soul among church we are heavenlies in our soul amen now watch your three you're a Triune being you're a body a spirit and a soul but he never said that you were Heavenly in your spirit he never said you were heavily in your flesh but he said you were Heavenly in your soul come on church and amen can I preach to you amen you've got five inner senses and you got five outer senses the five inner senses are two outer senses rather are to your flesh the five innocences are to your spirit but there was only one sense that can get to your soul and it's not seed taste feel smelling here it's not reason and affection memory imagination and conscience it is Faith amen that the only thing that can get to the real you is the faith of God in the generation that you're living in that's why we're still here amen cause the devil done everything he could to take us out by the flesh he'd done everything he could to take us out by the spirit but God who is rich in Mercy for the seeking inside your soul and research you Esther for a Time such as this that's why there ain't nothing can move you but this message that's why there ain't nothing can change you but this message because it's the only thing that God allowed to access your soul [Applause] yeah feelings has nothing to do with it [Applause] imagination reasoning has nothing to do with it I'm on Church I'll tell you what a prophet said he said in the message called the hour has come it's a little quote but it's a powerful one he said the hour has come to separate your feelings from your faith he said the hour has come to separate your feelings from your faith what do you saying preacher I'm saying feelings is one thing and faith is another and Malachi 4 did not come to restore our feelings and come to restore faith we will not take a Rapture by the way we feel we will not overcome not the way we feel but we'll overcome by the word that we believe and the word we believe is sharper and more powerful than any two-edged sword oh yeah we're not a bunch of Earthbound chicken eyes chickens [Applause] brother Brandon emphatically teaches the church that the believer's position in Christ is Heavenly places if you're not in the heavenlies tonight and your name is on the Lamb's Book of Life you're out of your position now what are you say it I'm saying that this is an adoption message this is an adoption message don't don't you reduce this message down to Pentecostal little feeling somewhere this is a positionally placing message now ah I tell you what I feel the strength of the message in this church your adoption is not your birth you was a son at Birth you were predestinated unto adoption brother said for the sons of the last day yes my brother you were predestinated for adoption for the sons of the last days now that might hurt Pentecostal he said I got born again praise the God I got the Holy Ghost Pine you're a child of God but that ain't what I'm talking about see adoption is placing a son yes sir so I could easily say heavenly adoption Heavenly say it Heavenly Place Heavenly situated Heavenly fixed amen what are you saying I'm saying the bride by an adoption message has been positionally placed in the heavenlies look at somebody next to you say heavenly [Applause] they say can you prove that well the prophet said in the countdown he said the position of the church that should be plum in the heavenlies not down here floating through the clouds buzzing around like an airplane but it's something that's propelled by something that sends it beyond anything that an airplane could think of it's an astronaut oh now we've just found out where we're set amen it's an astronaut age where spiritual astronauts [Applause] we are now living in a spiritual astronaut age amen now come on church when brother Adam said the position of the church is plumbed in the heavenlies he did not say we visit the heavenlies he said live in the heavenlies now come on cause y'all know we're still humans but according to a prophet there's a people on the Earth who has been propelled beyond anything that the Earth has ever seen and whatever they have received amen has put them in position to live in the heavenlies regardless of what's going on in the Earthly oh I feel like shouting on that one amen amen you know what they say about us they say we're two we're too heavily minded to be any Earthly good and you know what I know there's an element of Truth to that amen but I say thank God there's a people from the face of the earth that is so Heavenly minded that the things of the Earth can no longer influence the decisions they make amen if you're Earthly minded then you're still wearing high-heeled shoes and you're still painting your face and boys are still wearing shorts and we're still going to picture shows and we still got televisions in our home come on church if you're Earthly minded amen we're still wearing clothes that you look like he was poured into foreign but if we are heavily minded then Hollywood fashion has lost its influence over the way we dress if we're Heavenly minded then denomination has lost its influence over the way we conduct our services oh I know what I'm talking about amen I I'm not ignorant worldliness is creeping right in the churches I know and it's got to work now it comes in and dares you to say anything about it well guess what you got for wrong preacher here tonight you didn't hire me so you can't fire me I got the guts to say what a prophet said he said wash the makeup off he said clean out the high-heeled shoes clean out the clothes bring Holiness back in the church and apply the token the death Angels passing through yes my brother yeah hell brother Andrew it don't matter you know why it don't matter because you've heard too Earthly minded but if you were Heavenly minded the things of Heaven would actually matter to you now y'all know I'm telling the truth it's a whirliness spirit well brother Andrew don't say nothing about it okay how long are we not going to say nothing about it until all of our boys are wearing skinny jeans well glory to God I think the message ought to change the way we conduct ourselves that's exactly right I think we ought to see a difference between a Pentecostal girl and a message girl yes sir I think we ought to be a difference between a charismatic home and a message home and the separation is the word of God and the word alone look up you gotta carry yourself away come on you got to get above these Earthbound things till you can see the things it was the things it is and the things that shall come he said see spiritual astronauts in the astronaut age they've been positionally placed in the heavenlies by the Holy Ghost itself now I feel that devil pushing at me and I will push back it's a spirit from the pits of hell that wants our I refuse to lay down the microphone and let Hollywood dress her girls I refuse to lay down this message and let Sports influence our boys I think somebody ought to get forgot to say what a prophet said it's time to clean house again Church [Applause] I know where I'm at I heard Brothers say today he said the man told me not long ago said brother Brandon you got to stay in a ditch he said stay in a ditch he said there's one ditch full of formals he said there's another ditch full of Fanatics he said my commission is to stay in the middle of the road that man said well that's a nice saying brother Branham he said but if you stay in the middle of the road you'll get run over he said oh no I won't he said it's a one-way Street he said I won't get run over it's a one-way Street listen on this street there is no coming and going there's just a going come on Church we're not turning around we're not going back that's why brother Stephen we can March in the middle of a road that's why we can stay with what a prophet's saying yes sir yes yes now now if you're going to see the spiritual astronauts in the astronaut age you've got to realize where you are and according to a prophet the Masterpiece 64 he said notice hear the life somebody say the life that was in the husk he said in the stalk in the tassel in the husk all gathers in the seed he said see the life that was in the stalk went into the other to make the other and he stops and says justification made a way for sanctification and sanctification made a way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost which made a way for the Holy Ghost itself a bone Church there's three elements to a birth there's four stages to Restoration there's water blood spirit constitutes a birth but if you're speaking of restoration amen there were four death Messengers that eat away the tree then if there were four death Messengers three life Messengers will not restore it it will take the same amount to combat the death it'll take the same amount in the Life yes my brother now people say to me well brother you've got to be careful with that fourth life you got to be careful with that fourth stage well the reason they have to be careful is they haven't seen it but the reason I don't have to be careful is because I've seen it amen I've seen it in the word yes I've seen it in the message yes I've seen it in nature I see it in the bride I'm on Church yes bridge if you dismiss the fourth light do you realize how many sermons you gotta throw away you've got to throw away the restoration of the bad tree then you've got to throw away all your countdown tapes and then you gotta throw away your restoration you got to throw away your Jehovah Jireh series you got a four-way crash just a mystery you've got to throw away the Masterpiece that's because this was the Capstone message yes my brother yes it was the ushering in of the Holy Ghost itself come on church have you forgot what a prophet said he said there were seven mountain peaks in Colorado he said and right they're spelled out on them Peaks his last name he said we have now come to the seventh Peak he said if the Continental Divide he said we can go no further the gospel must return back East again for those church amen the message of the hour amen it's not coming back in a tent in a white horse rider and some bumpity bumpity airplane but the message of the hour is in the flesh of the Bride tonight can I say it to you we're riding the trail right now we're right in the trail right now yes my brother the word has come into the bride and it's changed her conception what is it it's the Holy Ghost itself oh come on I got to preach this to you if you're spiritual astronauts then horse and buggy Faith won't work for you if you're spiritual astronauts automobile airplane faith will not work for you spiritual astronauts have to have astronaut faith [Applause] so we got to have it that's right and it's astronaut power do you know what the astronaut faith is you know if astronaut power is is to realize that we're in Christ already he said see just more of Christ to lift us up into Heavenly places then the Reverend said it very plainly in the spiritual food he said the faith of this hour amen is Rapture and Faith it's going to take more faith than ever was any age for this has to be a rapturing faith what is it to be taken up see in the countdown 62 it'll take astronaut Faith Amen to fly you off of this Earth to meet Jesus yes my brother now wait a second brother Stephen because I thought that the airplanes flew they did but do you realize that horse and buggy the airplane and the automobile all stayed within the bounds of Earth they never left the Earth the airplane went in the sky but it never left the Earth amen but what left the Earth the astronaut [Applause] salt horse and buggy Faith was good for horse and Biggie drivers and automobile Faith was good for car riders and airplane faith is good for Pentecostal Pilots amen but this is not a Pentecostal age this is a bad age amen this is the age where we're going to leave the Earth feel the influence of it in my body right now we're gonna leave this earth Church [Applause] Hallelujah that's right he said don't be left to sleeping virgin then you better get in the astronaut right now and get above the things of the Earth get above it get above it what is it it's represent is one of his final and latest achievements is to manifest himself and say he that believeth in me the works that I do shall he do also what is it brother Branham it's spiritual manifestations of spiritual word becoming literally fulfilled before us [Applause] spiritual manifestations of spiritual word is becoming literally fulfilled before us among church that's not the only place you hear that word go to your church age book and he said this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride what is it it's spiritual Revelations that are manifesting the spiritual things that God promised would take place he said we're lifted far beyond that now the church is Way Beyond that the spiritual church it's the eagle age now it's the astronaut flying on above looking at the fellow citizenship and see we're far above that we're way up yonder in the heavenlies where Christ becomes the full thing that takes completely over and lives his life and acts through you exactly like he did here on the earth come on church I can say what a prophet said the alpha has become the Omega whatever was in the beginning has now come into the ending yes sir come on church then whatever he was in the beginning the bridegroom the bride will be the same thing come on the way he forgave is the way she'll forgive it's the way he loved it's the way she loves the way he walks is the way she'll walk yes I know what I'm talking about because this is the Omega bride can I go ahead and say it yes sir the way he believed she'll believe [Applause] come on church that's on it feel good Hallelujah that's why you're still believing you know why you're still believing cause you're not believing he in you is believing his whole word brother Kelly the faith of God has found the channel back into the heart of the Bride to manifest what are you say it I'm saying the countdown his own church the life that was in the bride's room is now in the bride I know it's Winston out but I feel like preaching for a second God's greatest achievement amen you know what it was Rebrand said to leave the Earth he said God's Church to leave the Earth to another world which is heaven now we're leaving to another world which is heaven now let me say it to you like this the way the prophet said he said they need their eyes open people become so EarthBound just like this was the only place there was see but there's a Heavenly world too come on now and he didn't stop there he said it's all around us [Applause] [Music] do you realize right here in Gastonia North Carolina in spoken word Tabernacle on a Wednesday night there is a Heavenly World in this building and it's all around you so come on church so the prophet was not taking you to heaven to experience Heaven he was saying Heaven has come to you by the message of the hour [Music] hello Church you know what you are you are citizens of another kingdom amen I'm gonna have to steal it brother Josh forgive me I heard Josh Bennett preach this a long time ago he said see what's happened it's because of of countries coming into other countries he said now you can be in America and he said because we have Spanish people in America he said you can eat a you can eat Mexican food in America he said because we have Chinese people in America he said you can eat Chinese food in America he said when you go to Africa he said because there's Americans there he said you could eat American food in Africa he said in other words because of this message you could enjoy Heaven on this side of Heaven that's my brother yes sir amen amen Destiny if you want to take it all the way we can brother Branham said this he said it's a seven course meal come on Church you don't have to wait till you die to go to the marriage supper of the lamb and eat the meal of the Seven Seals but because God who is rich in Mercy oh out of prophet to speak the word we are sitting in time but we are eating Eternal Manna we are sitting on the earth and we are hearing from our theophany we are sitting on the Earth foreign places [Applause] glory to God we ain't gotta wait to go to heaven to dance we can dance right here we don't have to wait to go to heaven to shout we can shop right here we don't have to wait to go to heaven Amen to enjoy the stimulation of Revelation [Applause] there's a Heavenly world it's all around us I'm not a crazy man I'm not a crazy man brother Josh said it very plainly when he preached that he said another citizen another culture has influenced this culture y'all know what I'm talking about we are not earth-bound people any longer what are you getting that preacher can I can I say it as plain as I know how the problem of God said it very plain he said the Corinthians were they were they were babies right he said Paul could not teach the Corinthians the things he could teach the Ephesians Abraham said it very plain he said I want to dress up until you you Ephesians speaking of Paul he said I want to put your feet up in the heavens a little while instead of being so Earthbound now come on Church nowhere in the book of Corinthians does he preached the revelation of the foreknowledge and predestination and adoption like he does in the book of Ephesians you know why because the Corinthians were living by sensation they were living by a tongue they were living by a Psalm amen but when Paul come on the scene he said let's go another step amen let's step up a little bit higher and what did he say he said now you were predestinated from before the foundation of the world sister that would have choked to Corinthians but it fed the Ephesians yes what would a choke the Corinthians is what fed the Ephesians and the prophet comes in 1965. in the final time he preaches Paradox and says we are promised another Ephesians then brother yes brother Stephen we were not promised another Corinthians we were promised another Ephesians yes sir what's he showing you he's showing you there's a world outside of what you're used to come on he said there's a world outside of what you're used to he said we're Earth and people we think of Miles inches feet and so forth he said but to God there's another world and he stops and brother he Likens it to a baby he says a baby in his mother's womb for nine months amen Amen brother Maurice you remember a few months ago there at the hospital I bet that baby's been there for nine months amen Mariah went in the hospital had the baby on Wednesday I think Friday night we were sitting out in the her in the Thursday night early Friday morning 12 o'clock at night we're sitting out there and you know he's been in there for nearly nine months he don't know anything else but what's in the mother's womb come on but but come on Malachi there's life outside of that womb amen there's a there's a group of people waiting to welcome you into the world I remember Maurice they got up and he said listen we got to get a move on he said I'm gonna go talk to my grandson team to get a move on he had been in there too long it was time to come out come on church and this message was the calling out of the Bride amen come on Church the seed was trapped in a Pentecostal shock but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel yes come on you know what I'm talking about yes you didn't think there was any life outside of it you was used to going to church you was used to speaking in tongues you was used to just shouting and having little serving ads but when you heard the eagle scream when you heard the voice of identification it called you out of Babylon and said welcome to the bride age [Applause] my brother yes sir there's life outside of what you're used to I say oh God what a prophet said they need their eyes open Church you know what you need right now you don't need another message and you don't need another messenger and you don't need another Bible you need your eyes open to what's around you and the only way your eyes can come open is there would be an ASAP Revelation 3 18 that anoint thine eyes that their eyes may see that word c means to look it means to discern a bone church that's why the devil hates you brother Stephen that's why the Devil Couldn't trap you in false Doctrine because you had Asaf [Applause] it tried brother Maurice but it couldn't because you already had eyeshaft listen friends before the false Doctrine come your way you was already equipped with a seed to discern between the spirit of truth and the spirit of error come on that's why the devil hates this bride it's cause we conceive ourselves [Applause] you know why the devil wanted you to stay blind because a blind person no offense but a blind person is easier to deal with you can tell them that color is that and they have to say it because they have no ability to see for themselves you can tell them the sky is green and they believe the sky is green because they have no ability to see for themselves but when their eyes come open amen amen amen when their eyes come open they can see it's not three Gods it's one Lord when their eyes come open they can see that as God said his word he always sent it by the channel of the prophets yes that's right when their eyes come open they can see the horror of Revelation 17. it's the Roman Catholic church and her Harlot daughters are the prostitute denominations preach my brother when our eyes come open [Applause] listen brother Stephen I've had a lot of them tell me in my few short young years if you leave me you're finished well let me just go and say this I am obligated to no man if a man could have stopped me Daddy he would have stopped me a long time ago but a man didn't call me and a man can't finish me but he that has begun a good work [Applause] I got eyes to see I got ears to hear remember said what he said that we might he said send that I said well Mercy y'all are pulling faster and I can preach we might have Isaac amen anoint my eyes that we might see the invisible God come on church we might see the invisible God working among his people he promised he would not leave us he promised what he'd done he would be with us and the works that he was doing we would do like manner works until he comes somebody say see the invisible God brother Stephen that's almost a contradicting statement to see the invisible God but thank God for a prophet who said Jesus did the works of the father amen so when you've seen the works of when you've seen The Works in Jesus you were seeing the father he said that's right amen Jesus was the Incarnate God he said that God the Father which is the father of Jesus Christ the great spirit dwelt in the fullness of his power in Jesus Christ which was the Tabernacle of God made flesh and dwelt on Earth representing the word Jesus was the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was invisible but the word was made flesh the word was invisible until it was made flesh and then the word become visible Humble Church wherever Jesus is that's where Heaven is [Applause] am I going too long wherever Jesus is that's where Heaven is and let me say this if Jesus is in this building tonight amen amen if Jesus is in this building and you know what he is yes yes he is you say preacher I don't see him I don't say nail scarred hands I don't see a pierce driven side that's not the form he promised to be herein he promised to be here in the form of a prophetic message yes my brother and if the message is in the church and the church is in the message and the message is in the bride then the bride's flesh yes that's brought the invisible God visible in this generation I feel like throwing this microphone and running the invisible God is in this building he's here open your eyes glory to God open your eyes where's Jesus he's here yes my brother [Music] but brother we're surrounded tell Elisha that about church you got Hazel walked out there come back in and said Elijah we're surrounded we're surrounded said they wanted to see I'm gonna preach it to you he said they wanted to see the Syrian Army he said well I should struck the whole shame in the Army said are you looking for Elisha they said yes he struck them and said follow me I'll show you where he's at so the Syrian Army could not see Elisha without a prophet [Music] a bone Church they were there but without a prophet they couldn't see what was there I feel like exploding brother Stephen when gehazal walked out there he saw all the Syrian Army surrounding them he saw all the enemies there he come back in and he said Elisha we're in trouble we're surrounded he said I don't think so come follow me [Applause] leadership come follow me and Elijah and gehaza got behind Elisha and he walked out there and he looked up at the mountains and he said good evening friends [Applause] good evening friends there's more with us than there is with him come on Church the Chariots of Fire the angels of fire sisters Addie they were all there when gahesa first went out there but without a prophet they couldn't see what was there come on Church yes my brother Heaven has always been there but we didn't know what it was but in the end time the prophets had come walk with me and he led us to the Future home and he led us through things Lord of me and he let us be on the curtain of time and he said I didn't put it there it was always there [Applause] a brother can I say something rich got Haze his eyes come open by the words of a Vindicated Prophet that's exactly right I said it I meant it I stand behind it and I represent it the Hazel's eyes yes sir come open by the words of a Vindicated Prophet well I might as well go and say it and Maurice's eyes come open by the words of a Vindicated prophet and Stephen's eyes and Richard's eyes and gonna kill these eyes come open brother Robert has come open it's not aware to the Vindicated prophets shut us up now we can't shut up we've done seen it [Applause] [Music] see what's gonna happen is your eyes have got to come open to what God has for you but I've been said anoint our eyes with Isaac that our eyes may see he said anoint our hearts that we might believe [Music] can I have a few more minutes preaching there's a connection between your eyes and your heart the anointing is not just going to be on your eyes it's also going to be on your heart anoint our eyes to see but anoint our heart to Believe come on Church anoint our eyes with us have to say y'all forgive me it's a it's a it's a habit okay you all are pulling anoint our eyes to see [Applause] anoint our hearts to believe now can I can I can I bring this to you [Applause] if the position of the church is in the heavenlies I'm just a dumb country boy okay but don't you think it's time to explore the heavenlies foreign is plum in the heaven at least amen that don't you think it's time to explore the heavenlies yes don't you think it's time to preach some Heavenly messages [Applause] don't don't you think it's time to take them Earthly messages of debate whether the message is the absolute or not don't you think it's time to take him to the graveyard and bury him [Applause] I've heard some guys and they get up and then they say praise God I'm just going to preach by inspiration I'm not one of them study preachers I'm not one of them Revelation preachers I'm just going to preach by inspiration preach them up then they look at you and say well I didn't study because I just don't believe in all that deep Revelation and we can all tell you didn't study you don't have to tell us that we can tell you didn't study because you ain't got nothing to say that'll feed the bride Texas well I'll tell you one thing what I've done I went to them tapes and quotes and I went on to better things and we can tell you did but let me just say this the reason why there's no anointing is because the better things you went to were not the better things of Hebrews eight they were the better things of some religion [Applause] bird listen I know it's not popular but humble yourself and just say what a prophet said if he said the third pool's here just say it if he said you always was the son of God just say it if he said you're Justified just say it amen this bride is not fed by little sermonettes Church a little well I just I don't really got much to say tonight I just was out and found something or something come on but do you realize who you are your roof and you're in the field of Boaz [Applause] come on I know people say well well all Rue Scott was handfuls but do you realize those handfuls were mouthfuls they were not just little crumbs that Boaz was leaving behind they were a handful of purpose I'm on church and according to the book of Ephesians you have been called to an eternal purpose [Applause] then come on church I'm about to lay out of here climb up on out of this religious age and walk around in the heavenlies and pick up some handfuls foreign explore the message you've explored Dr Dobson and your marriage is still on the Rocks explore the message you'd explore TD Jakes and you're still broke and you're still a discouragement oh church but explore the message you've explored all them charismatic dudes that told you sow a seed and you'll be rich in no time this message was the Turning of your attention from the Earthly things to the Heavenly things and over their money don't matter that's right yes my brother [Applause] I know how long I've been preaching preach preach preaching can I can I can I go on just a second explore the heavenlies you know what's that word explore means it means to travel in them it means to go through them it means to familiarize yourself with the country area in order in order to learn about or familiarize oneself with it means to search for the resources hell Glory it means to inquire into or discuss amen as subject or issue in detail the brother Stephen you're no longer just preaching the low shallow thoughts listen to my brother when I first started evangelizing I mean people told me they said brother Andrew Evans us that's not your place you're not to preach the seventh seal not to preach the third pool just just preach some little simple Evangelistic thoughts I said okay I said well I guess that's not what I'm called to do so I go and try to find some little shallow amen simple Evangelistic thoughts it would satisfy what people thought all to be saying but you know when I found out I found out there was no anointing for me in those you know why because my anointing is not laying in some of the little shallow idea of some man's imagination my anointing is laying in the resources of the message of the earth that I say thank God for men like brother Stephen thank God for this powerful Ministry that'll dig through the message [Applause] they'll dig through the quote they'll dig to the scriptures and they'll find something they'll find a golden nugget and they'll polish it up and they'll bring it to the church [Applause] my brother you may not like it but I'm gonna say it anyhow there's still resources in this message glory to God you know why you know why you don't like it now don't get mad at me because you're lazy you're too lazy to get to digging that's right well that brother Stephen do all that did let the preachers do all the dick and you need to get up and get the word and start digging [Applause] come on mamas come on mamas you're the Fifth Gospel yes and your child ought to be here in these tapes yes my brother yes sir get mad at me if you want to I really don't care you ought to turn off the Netflix you ought to turn off for YouTube yes and dig for this message and put some streaks on the bones of that chance my brother yes sir come on fathers don't get mad at me ain't been better the head of that house come on you're the head of that house you stand between the outside world and that family and you ought to get to digging in this message [Applause] I said start digging in it well brother Andrew I'm too young to understand this you know what that is that's a lie from the pits of hell we have got kids sitting in message churches that are graduating from universities with degrees to build computers and to build software programs if you can build a computer you can understand this message [Applause] It's a lazy devil they don't want to sacrifice and dig through the message [Applause] but my Bible said search the scriptures my Bible said in the book of Acts they searched the word daily you know what the prophet of God said I'm coming I'm tying this together he said God and his spiritual achievement is going forward we're not going backward come on Brad we're going forward do you know how we're going forward he said by looking into the word and believing the promises for the things that never has come yet yeah the church the bride is moving forward by digging into the Heavenly message and believing for the promises of the things that has never come yet come on can I say it to you we can dig and find where Noah built an ark [Applause] and we can preach it and you know what it'll do it'll bring a search of faith in the building but you know what it won't bring a search of faith that you need you know why because that's already been done [Applause] but you start digging over in the fifth seal and you hear the prophet say the time is going to come that the spoken word will restore Mission limbs did you just see the surge of faith that come in the building did you feel that did you feel that spiritual lift did you feel that change did you feel that change in the atmosphere you know why it come because that's your promise [Applause] eyes has already seen an art float through the floodwaters but eyes has yet to see a miss and Liam restored upon a body but this day in this age will this word be fulfilled amen amen amen amen amen come on Church don't get mad at me please don't get mad at me but quit looking through the word and just come into church to have a good little shout and Hallelujah time we're Beyond a good little shout and Hallelujah time yes my brother I challenge you by the message of the hour it's time to believe God for the big things [Applause] it's time it's time it's time to put your walking shoes on come on church it's time to get acquainted [Applause] people say mother you talk about studying the message yeah remember said we have by God's help we do have by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word amen with Divine Vindication amen amen amen we are in this world but we are not of this world there is a deep calling to the Deep there is a calling from a place of perfection now I'm gonna have to skip a lot to say this Third Exodus 1963. says these words he says we're going to leave here one of these mornings okay but Stephen we're going to leave here one of these mornings after thinking about something with that word familiarize yourself ever go to a theater or an auditorium to see a singer or a concert or your kids in a play or something and you go in this this Auditorium and you walk in there and you sit down and all of a sudden it gets real dark and out of nowhere a voice comes in and the voice says Welcome to our theater Welcome to our Auditorium in the unlikely event of an emergency we would like for you to familiarize yourself with the exits out of the auditorium and out of nowhere while it's dark a lot will come on above the door and it says Exit because it's dark the second the light comes on you didn't get up and go to the light for it to get your attention but when the light come on it connected with your eyes and it turns your eyes towards the light the exit sign didn't come to it the sign the light turns your eyes to and I got to thinking about this we are in the darkest of Seven Ages that's right and we had a Prophet come in this generation and you know what he said he said it's not going to be an unlikely event he said it's events made clear by prophecy I'm on Church yes sir the background from the Rapture is Psalms 27 and it's in the time of trouble right right it's a total blackout but there's a man here there's a man here that can turn on the light come on Church you gotta get out of here come on you gotta get out of here you can't stay here um you gotta get out of here come on and you know what in that theater in that Auditorium brother Stephen there's multiple exit signs which means there's multiple exits but in this message if you want out of time into eternity if you want to leave this world by The Rapture there is only one exit brother Kaylee you know what it is it's the message of the hour it's the calling out of the Bride for the church The Exodus for the Rapture come on Church the World Church is headed for tribulation but some ride is headed for glorification God who is rich in Mercy you say what is that Mercy he said God makes a way of Escape for all those who desire to fall that way that's the mercies with him making a way of Escape thank you Hallelujah yes my brother if you never in the last in the last fall of this sermon if you'd never hear this crazy spitting sweating hollering preacher again you hear these words get in the message [Applause] get in them books get in them tapes get in that word it's your exit it's your exit come on you know what the Arc was the art was the exit from the old world to the new world I gotta quit y'all preach me all night they are closely exit from the old world to the new world do you know what there come a time there coming time for 120 years that Noah worked on the ark but can I say this there come a time the ark was finished there was no more wood put on it there was no more tar there was no more pitch there was nothing added to it it was finished so when it was finished do you know what you've done if you wanted to go to the new world you got in it you got in it you got in it and it took you from the old world to the new world well can I tell you what this message is this message is your right from laodicea into the future home you know what and it is finished in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished come on spoken word Tabernacle your ride is finished brother Abel we just

you out of this world [Applause] [Music] can I say it to you like this God's power to transform power of transformation program says it very plainly he says the word Ark transform the people from the Earth to Glory he said from the Earth to the skies can I tell you what didn't happen thank you Noah's Ark transformed those that was in it from the Earth to the skies can I say this it did not affect those around it in other words you could have been hanging on to the side of it and you wouldn't have made it you could have thought you knew more than no one knew in the ark so you could have got in front of it and tried to lead the ark and you still would have died because the only provided place of protection was to those that were in it [Applause] now listen if you're hanging onto the rails of this message you won't make it to the new world and if you get elevated in your mind that you know more than a prophet and you know more than the message you've got a better way to approach it so you get out from around it and get in front of it you won't make it the ark will run you over [Music] but if you want Fedora to open and see the streets of gold the walls of Jasper the gates of pearl [Music] you better get in it once you stand to your feet with us this evening the message the prophet of God said the message he said it's finished it's a perfect message do you realize your air you are heir to a Heavenly message you are The Heirs of salvation to a Heavenly message said if I was heir to something he said what I want to do is I would want to see what I'm here to brother he said I'd want to walk through there and see what was left for me he said I'd want to see what is what was there that had my name on it he said and you know what he said if there was something a little too high for me he said you know what I'd do he said I'd get get the ladder and he said I'd climb up there and I'd get a hold of it [Applause] you know what I say Church I say it's time to start climbing through this message I don't have much confidence in Earthly things but I do have confidence in the Heavenly things somebody say well ah this church is pretty Lively yeah it is I say well then people they sure cut up over there and they act up and they hollered you know what's brought to God said he said in that meeting over at Mishawaka that night he said that guy got up he said one guy got up and got to preaching out Earthly things he said didn't move nobody he said another guy got up here and got to preach about Earth through things real Earthly you know intellectual thinks it didn't live

to hold the microphone got to preaching about where were you Joe when I laid the foundations of the world he said a few minutes later he jumped back jumped up clicked his heels together let's round it all them preachers said you ain't got room enough up here for me to preach I love what my brand said brother Stephen he said he got to preach on them Heavenly things [Applause] amen there was a lot of room to preach on them Earthly things but when he climbed up there in them Seven Seals and he climbed up earned them things in order to be in that communion table and that invisible Union in Daniel 70 weeks and so the only place to go is to heaven it's lifted us we've been raised together listen y'all got to forgive me I I don't get this atmosphere all the time I enjoy it you love this word you love this message praise God search it out Church yes sir it's a Heavenly message glory to God listen I rephrase that I get this atmosphere anywhere I can preach the message but if I can't preach the

old order of thanking Lord father we no longer live by the way the former Elders of traditions thoughtful things would be but Lord God who is rich in Mercy Lord you allow the prophet to go beyond the curtain of time to see all those things Lord you allowed him in 64 to be called up into the revelation of your word as he was studying to bring a beautiful sermon called the future home Lord to take Revelation 21 and open our eyes to see what the future home is going to be or did you send a prophet to search out heaven and things that are to be in the way of the Rapture and the Rapture tape Lord so many sermons and I can speak of right now Lord I pray if there be one person here tonight Lord it is not digging into this message lord they're not they're not they're not taking these words and taking them home and laying in them Father Lord if our homes are not filled with the sound of the voice of the seventh angel father I love every man of God that is preaching this message I love ever ever faithful Ministry gift that you've given us Lord my father I believe that we're living in an age where or not everywhere not everybody but so many are becoming so swept away we're just following this ministry and following that Ministry and judging things by the way one man teaches it against the way their Pastor teaches it and so many Lord help us dear God help us to know every church is solved within itself and help us to know that this message is the absolute to every church it's the absolute to every Ministry Lord It's the absolute to ever home to ever life so God if there be one here tonight that is not feeding fully upon this word to give themselves strength to Fly Above these denominations and things of the world father may they do so at this time Lord may they break out of this Earthbound Realm what if they've got so comfortable in just justification may they know there's a world outside of it they've got comfortable and sanctification may they know there's a world outside of it if they got comfortable in the baptism of the Holy Ghost may they know there's a world outside of it father the seed has got to come back to seed Lord we've got to progress all the way to the Holy Ghost itself the word Heaven preeminence The Life of Christ taken over completely in the Church of the Living God now father I pray you take these things and place him in the hearts of your children Lord I don't want to be known as a great preacher father I don't want to be known as something great I just want to be known as someone who took this message and challenged the hearts of the people to dig into it and find the Revelation nuggets for themselves to feed upon it encourage him Lord with this word I pray father may you give our brother Stephen A Grace Lord is he as he sacrifices hours of his time Lord to to dig into the resources of this word and to find things to strengthen and edify your people may you give him a Grace so God Lord may you give these people a
