TRANSCRIPT
========================================
baby. There's nothing like it. Only God's love. A mother may forget her sucking babe, but never can I forget you. Your names are engraved on the palms of my hands. &gt;&gt; How can he forget you? I'll never forsake thee or never leave thee. I'll be with thee always, even to the end of the world. There she looks at her baby. Maybe she slipped back and kissed his little forehead. Whether she fainted and died on the outside, she goes out. It's just beginning to kind of sun begin to rise over the Judeian hills. And she looks at the sun begin to peep up way down the street. She hears cursing in going on. And she goes out in the yard and noticed she picked up two sticks. Not an arm load. Two sticks. What is it? the cross. Now, anyone knows, any of my Indian friends sure know or any hunter, the correct way of making a fire to last is cross two sticks, two logs, light it right in the middle, just keep pushing the ends in. It'll last all night. Many time have I laid in the wilderness with two sticks, no bigger than that, and keep warm all night. Just enough to keep warm. Keep it going. Right in the center of it. Now what's she going to do like these two sticks and the word and the spirit is brought to self-sacrifice on the cross ready for duty ready for life putting the word and the spirit that's her faith in the word of God by the Holy Ghost leading herself to sacrifice anything else to the cross. And when she got the stick under her arm, two of them, and started back, she started back. And there was a voice came from the gate. Lady, just before that, an old maybe baldheaded and gray hanging over his whiskers and his hair hanging down, a little stick in his hand, an old sheep skin or something wrapped around him, walking down the street saying, "Lord, it's a certain little white fence. There'll be a lovely looking young woman. She must have been young. The boy was young out in the yard. You told me that was the widow that was to feed me. Now, where is she at? I'll keep walking. The spirit leads him this way, then turns him. Oh, it's so wonderful. Sons of God are led by the spirit of God. No matter how silly it sounds, &gt;&gt; they are led. &gt;&gt; She go he goes down one street and up another. Down one street and up another. After a while, the spirit said, "Look to your right." And he looks sitting around like that just like he does here at the platform night after night. &gt;&gt; Oh, God's still the same. &gt;&gt; Look to your right, to your left. There's someone praying who needs it. And he looked to his right and say, "There's a little white fence. That's just right. I just won't move from here because there's the old tree standing there. There's everything just the way I saw in the vision. The door opens. A little thin woman comes out. Now remember, she's just going to pick up two sticks. She couldn't have picked up three. Takes two to make the cross. She picked up two sticks and put her on her arm. And she started back thinking I'll have the little cake done when Sunny wakes up. And then I'll feed it to him. I won't eat any myself and I'll put my little boy in my arms and there will sit and die. And she started into the house. She heard a strange voice across the gate said,"Woman, would you fetch me a little drink of water in a vessel?" And she turned and she thought, "There stands a kind old man at the gate." She looked at him real close and maybe wiped the tears from her eyes. It was quite early yet, you know, God does so strange. She was willing to sacrifice. Water was a scarce rain for three years.

Um, um, I have something to read to you today. Uh, &gt;&gt; okay. So, um, yesterday when we were at question and answer, um, you know, as she's there, um, she asked me for a piece of paper and, you know, while we're doing what we do, she just wrote these things and so she she read it to us in the car and I mean, it just blessed our heart, you know, that it said, as it said, suffer the little children to come unto me and there's the kingdom of heaven. So, you know, when you bring them around the word, that's the result that you'll see. And she's going to read that now, right? Okay. Go ahead.

That's wonderful. &gt;&gt; And the Lord will surely take possession of this young lady. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We invite Sister Lily who has a shot short testimony. Amen. Okay. No problem. No problem. Um, I had to write it down or else I will babble a lot. So, I'll try to read it quickly to save time. Um, as you all know, I had a DNC surgery in April to remove a molar pregnancy and I have been in a six-monthlong recovery with my women's health doctor um which will be until this upcoming December. Um, a few weeks after the surgery, I started receiving the medical bills. There was some from everybody from the anesthesiologist, the proctologologist, my OB/GYN, LabCore, from the continuous monthly labs um that I'm still doing. But the biggest one was the biggest source of stress for us, which was the hospital bill um for almost $8,000. That was actually a discounted balance from the original 13,000. Um, obviously we did not have that much money to just hand to the hospital. Um, the day after my surgery, Zach had just started his class at his hit his new job and then a month after the surgery, like literally like three and a half weeks after the surgery, we moved and our rent doubled as well. So, that was our priority financially. Um, once I received the majority of the bills, I submitted them to my member sharing insurance and I started an application with Medicaid. Um, DSS, oh, sorry, my phone is glitching. Um, DSS basically told me what paperwork they needed from me. And it took me about a week to gather all of that information, you know, pay stubs from both of us, um, anything possibly that I could get a hold of. And I gathered all of it, took it in a folder that was labeled, organized, stapled in person. Um, at the end of July, I got a letter in the mail that Medicaid denied any sort of coverage at all or any type of help with those bills. Um, I gave them everything they'd asked for. So, I called the case worker and asked what I had failed to submit. And she claimed that their records showed that the only documents that they had were my social security card and insurance card, which was what I dropped off my first visit when I started the application. I told her, "No, ma'am. That is not correct." I told her the exact day and time that I went to the office in person and handed it, told them, "Check the cameras." and that I brought a big labeled um folder with every single document. She said she would investigate and call me back in a few days to let me know what she finds. She called me at work the following week and I was already struggling that day. It was a Wednesday. Um I had already been sick for three weeks. I was coughing my head off so bad that it was actually making me vomit and I could hardly talk because I was losing my voice. Um she she called and confirmed that all they had were those two cards. So, they lost all the paperwork I gave them. And by this point, it had already been two months since I originally started the application. She uh I got really upset. I told her that the front desk, sent me to the second floor. I told her every detail I remembered, handed them I handed my documents to a little elderly white lady with short white hair and glasses, and even spoke to the case worker herself on the phone in one of their offices that day. She told me that they would never have sent me to the second floor because they don't process files up there. And she was basically talking to me like I'd hallucinated even doing it that day. She told me the best I can do is reapply and that I will not likely get coverage because it was now August and my surgery was in April. Um I told her well I told her I'm not going to reapply because you're just going to lose it again if I can't handle hand it to you directly. That day I went home and I called Zach and I was crying. I mean, I was really stressed out. I was starting to get colle like threatening to get sent to collections and I' I've never dealt with this before. So, it's my first surgery, my first big medical expense. And Zach told me, "You need to go to the prayer closet when you get home from work, and you just need to pray." So, I went home, I went my prayer closet, and I just started crying out to the Lord. And I had prayed before this that Medicaid would cover all of my bills. So, obviously, I was pretty disappointed. And uh my insurance was also not looking like it was going to cover anything as well. Um at this point, the temptation was pretty real to start freaking out and panicking, but I just told the Lord that I didn't choose for this to happen to me. And it's like Sister Georgia said yesterday, she didn't choose, she would never have chosen the path that the Lord God brought her through to get to this point. I told the Lord I would have never chosen to have three miscarriages or never chosen to get pregnant with a tumor. and as the doctor called it was a very rare random chance and have to have surgery to remove it. For each pregnancy I was preparing for a baby that I had prayed for and already loved. I didn't ask for it, but he saw it fit for me to go through every single one for a reason. And I just had faith that he would not put me through that and then leave me in the midst of it with all these medical bills that I didn't have the money to pay. I did my part and I didn't know how he would do it or when, but I just knew he was going to wipe the debt completely clean. and I told him I would testify when it happened. That same night, we had Wednesday night service and brother Seth preached that God not only cares about your salvation, but he also cares about your health and your finances. The hospital started sending me texts threatening to send me to collections. So, I decided to give them a call and tell them they could put me in jail and I still still wouldn't have the money to pay for to pay for it. Uh, as soon as I mentioned the text regarding that they sent me that they would send me to collections, a lady cut me off and told me that she would be happy to send me an application for finan financial assistance to fill out. By this point, um, when I called, I believe this was like a week earlier, and uh, Medicaid hadn't denied me yet. As a a few weeks went by, I got the application in the mail, I filled it out, and I even put on there at this point that Medicaid had denied me coverage. So, that was about a month ago. Um, over the last few weeks, the devil has attacked Zach and I at every angle, especially once our prayer meeting started within the last two weeks. The morning of this last Tuesday prayer meeting, I read my scripture for that morning, which was in 2 Kings 3 and 4, where Elisha had told the kings that ran out of water to dig ditches in the wilderness and that the Lord would provide the water and make wells for not only them to drink from, but for their cows and all their animals. I read in the next chapter of the widow with just one single pot of oil that obeyed the prophet when he told her to gather as many jars as she could to fill with oil from one single pot and it only stopped when she ran out of jars. And not only was she able to pay her debt that she owed, but she was able to provide for her and her family even after that. Remember that because that resonated with me this boosted my faith. And when brother Steven was praying that night in the Zoom, he started praying for people with financial struggles and mentioned the woman with the jar of oil and the debt. I wasn't even praying for our debt that night. But yesterday, I received a letter from the hospital that not only did I get approved for financial assistance, and not only did I get approved for 100% of my $8,000 balance, but it doesn't expire until next September. If I have to go to the hospital for any other issues between now and next September, it will be 100% covered by this financial assistance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. Oh, if if you keep reading if you keep reading in second Kings chapter 4, Elisha told the Shounomite woman that had no children that at a certain season according to the time of life, she would embrace his son. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She didn't believe him and it still happened. &gt;&gt; So, I believe it. He answered our prayers about multiple depths, debts that he completely wiped clean multiple times. He answered our prayers about Zach getting a job that he loved with more opportunity. He answered our prayers about where to move after we got married. And he answered so many other prayers. And I believe that he'll answer this one as well. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. And amen. Amen. Amen. Our God is living and real. Amen. You want to say one thing? &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Hey, how you guys doing? Uh, I just want to thank God for being with me. Uh, I went to a party um about a month ago and they just was shooting out and I got shot in the hand right here. But I just want to thank God because the bullet didn't go through or I still got all my fingers and uh it was a Glock 45. So it was just I just want to thank God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. And amen. Amen. Amen. Brother Greg, can you just come up? Amen. And share with us your Oh, sister Charlene, can you make it quick? Amen. Her uncle is home from the hospital. Amen. Amen. Prayer works. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord bless you all. Lord, we don't know what we all go through. And u quite a testimony. &gt;&gt; And you're going to hold that baby. [Music] [Applause] Well, my testimony, how many believe that God has a sense of humor? &gt;&gt; Brother Michael, it's good to see you back. Um, the other day, I think it was Thursday or Friday, my wife asked me, she says, "Are you going to the Q&A Saturday?" I said, "Well, that's a three-hour round trip, and I just don't feel like driving that." And then turn around and have to drive back down there Sunday. I'm thinking that's a lot of driving, and I just didn't feel like doing it. So, uh, obviously I didn't come, but the Lord taught me a valuable lesson. Um, Friday afternoon, I was out in my shed. I was, uh, refinishing, um, our, um, vanity from our bathroom, and I had brother Chad on from uh, this past Sunday. and uh he starts talking about this fellow that goes to church there. He lived in Columbus, Ohio, and it was a 2-hour drive from Columbus to Lima where brother Chad's church is at. And he was driving back and forth on Sundays. Well, he uh he ended up moving halfway, but then he he thought that wasn't good enough. So, he ended up moving to Lima because he wanted to fellowship with the brothers and sisters. He said, "I can drive to work." So, he he started driving to work every day, two hours. So, it's four hours round trip just so he could have fellowship and be at the church on Sundays and Wednesdays. And when I heard that, I said, "Okay, Lord, I know you're telling me to go tomorrow." [Applause] &gt;&gt; So, and I'm thinking, "Oh, man. I don't want to make that drive. I don't want to do it, but Lord, I know you're telling me to go." Well, I didn't go. And I've had my my other truck. I had the trailer hooked up to it and I had a bunch of brush on there from some trees that I trimmed and it's been sitting there for over a week and I keep saying, "Well, I'm going to do it tomorrow. Do it tomorrow." Well, I never did. Well, I did it yesterday and got to the landfill uh and I was doing some things. cut the truck off, was going to hook up to pull it off, the brush off, and I got back in to start the truck. It wouldn't start at all. And uh so um I get out, I'm look I'm look at the battery. The one of the post is all corroded because I don't drive the truck that much. And um so I call my wife. I says, "Uh can you come get me?" Uh, you know, and then but then somebody else showed up there at the landfill and he had a jumper box. So, we tried that. Didn't do a thing. He had jumper cables. We tried that. Didn't do a thing. So, I called my wife back. I said, "Come on, get me. I'm going to take this battery out. Go get a new battery." Because that battery been in there for quite a while. So, I took the battery out. We go to town, which is about six, seven miles away. get the battery, come back, put it in, and the terminal broke. And so, great. So, we had to go back into town and get that. I come back, put all that on, still wouldn't start. Wouldn't even do nothing. And uh I told my wife, I says, "Yeah, the Lord has a sense of humor. Uh now my truck is sitting at the landfill until tomorrow. And uh so I told her I says um just like uh several years ago when my trailer was stolen, I was going to work on a Wednesday and it was stolen and said never again am I going to work on Wednesday. So that being said, never again am I going to miss Q&A. Amen. Never again is it going to miss Q&A and never again are we going to miss our blessings. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Um we want to invite brother Michael. Amen. And we thank the Lord for traveling mercies bringing him and his wife back safely. We just invite him to come and thank the Lord for the lives of our brethren and also bring before the Lord our prayer request and then the tithes and offerings. Amen. Then after that we have our specials. Amen. God bless you all. &gt;&gt; It's good to be back. Stand up. Let's Let's stand up. It's good to be back among the children of God. I want to thank God for the traveling masses we had when we went to Nairobi, Kenya and back. We came back on on Friday still fighting jet lag. Um it was very nice to have question and answers. Brother Greg, somebody asked a question one year ago and it was about heaven. Where is heaven? But God being gracious enough, heaven came down yesterday. &gt;&gt; Yes. He God came down and showed us that heaven is right here with us. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. It was one of the most blessed question and answers I've ever heard in my life. And I want to thank God for the ministry that can yield to God so that we can have such nuggets. I went to bed very very happy person. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Let us pray.

We clear so far? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We clear? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Verse 12. for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night. In another place he says about midnight, but we didn't know when really it was. Here it's more vague this night. Is he going to be at 900 p.m. 8:00 p.m. or what? We don't know. So the the the the actual specific time is not known, &gt;&gt; right? We can just get a range of it. &gt;&gt; We clear so far. &gt;&gt; Are we clear? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the first Exodus. We are on the third one. He say, "I will pass through the land of Egypt this night." Come on. And will smite all the firstborn of the land of Egypt, both men and beasts, and against all the gods of Egypt, I will execute judgment. I am the Lord. You remember this for last Sunday. &gt;&gt; Amen. jump on verse uh 29. Glory to God. If you there, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 29, the Bible says that it came to pass that at midnight. Now, the time has come. &gt;&gt; Midnight there is no sun there. So, we're in the midst of darkness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; At midnight, you know the midnight cry, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're in the midst of darkness. Spooky &gt;&gt; because the spirit of death, the angel of death is on the land. &gt;&gt; Killing everywhere. &gt;&gt; Everybody's shouting, screaming. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 29. And it came to pass that at midnight the Lord smokeote. So God waited when it's dark. &gt;&gt; Yes. all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of the cattle, even animals. Verse 30. And Pharaoh rose up in the night. He and all his servant and all the Egyptian and there was a great cry in Egypt for there was not a house &gt;&gt; where there was not what &gt;&gt; one day. &gt;&gt; So everybody in Egypt have a problem at death. &gt;&gt; So this is not just a night of darkness but it's a dreadful night. a bad memorial. &gt;&gt; Everybody's screaming. In other words, you're sleeping. The whole city, &gt;&gt; the whole country is screaming. &gt;&gt; Everywhere. Every state is screaming. &gt;&gt; What is going on? There is death everywhere. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said this death here was the last plague. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So the last plague according to brother Brandham was deaf and according to the scripture are we together and we know that the last plague for the gentile age &gt;&gt; there is four horse riders &gt;&gt; you don't want me to go back to that again &gt;&gt; amen we got a white one &gt;&gt; the next one is a red one then we got a black one and the pale one his name was what &gt;&gt; death &gt;&gt; so the last rather the last anointing is water. &gt;&gt; Death. &gt;&gt; And the last thing before Israel leave Egypt is water. &gt;&gt; We clear so far? &gt;&gt; So the last plague before the Exodus, before departure is death. It's an angel of death. &gt;&gt; A pale horse. &gt;&gt; We clear so far? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jump to verse 34. So we save time. In 34 the Bible say you know the story and the people took their door &gt;&gt; before it was what &gt;&gt; leaven &gt;&gt; their what &gt;&gt; meeting troughs &gt;&gt; being bound up being bound up with their clothing upon their water &gt;&gt; shoulders &gt;&gt; they didn't take the bread &gt;&gt; they were making the bread &gt;&gt; are we together &gt;&gt; so Israel for some reason started to make bread. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So they took the flour and mix it with water. &gt;&gt; This is what makes dough &gt;&gt; or what you call paste. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The next step you add leaven. &gt;&gt; If you don't know how to cook, you can learn right here how to cook bread. Are we together? Are we together? This is the first step. &gt;&gt; The next step is when you put leaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Israel started to cook. &gt;&gt; They had a vision of bread, &gt;&gt; but they never could accomplish or finish the cooking in the land of Egypt. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So, before the Exodus, &gt;&gt; there will be certain things you will start. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; With a project to finish. &gt;&gt; But in the middle of the road &gt;&gt; of your project, the rapture will catch you. &gt;&gt; Are we together? And you will exit leaving your construction work. [Music] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? I just took an example for construction work. You won't be exiting this world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Leaving your bank account. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to move on. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; According to the way you were planning is I'm going to do this and finish. &gt;&gt; So there are things you will finish. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there are things you won't be able to finish. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So does it mean that we need to stop? You don't know what what it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whether it's going to be a building off a house, whether it's going to be a finishing off a career or maybe it's going to be a graduated from school. In other words, you may start school. &gt;&gt; Maybe on your junior year, the rapture come. &gt;&gt; If you want to continue in the tribulation, that's your problem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We clear so far? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Job to verse uh 35. And the children of Israel did according to the water. &gt;&gt; Word of Moses. &gt;&gt; We need to know this word of Moses. &gt;&gt; And they did what? &gt;&gt; Borrowed. &gt;&gt; Last Sunday we saw that the word is the ask. &gt;&gt; So Moses told them to ask. I have the scripture. I have another scripture where Moses say that if you need it, you ask me. I will give it to you. It's right here in the book of Exodus. If you go to Exodus 11, you will see at the beginning Moses talked to them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So they already got a message of Moses. We went through that last Sunday. And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses. And they ask or they borrow of who? &gt;&gt; The Egyptians. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Jewels of silver. &gt;&gt; And jewels of what? &gt;&gt; Gold. &gt;&gt; You remember there was a promise with Abraham. You remember that last Sunday? And what? &gt;&gt; Raymond. They ask for what? &gt;&gt; Silver. &gt;&gt; Jewel of what? &gt;&gt; Silver. &gt;&gt; And jewels of what? &gt;&gt; Gold. &gt;&gt; You love material, brother. And what else? &gt;&gt; Raymond. &gt;&gt; Clothing. &gt;&gt; Because Raymond sounds fancy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Who who told them to ask? &gt;&gt; Can you answer me? &gt;&gt; Who told them to ask? &gt;&gt; And Moses got instruction from who? &gt;&gt; So who told Israel to ask? &gt;&gt; And if God tells you to ask &gt;&gt; because the Bible says ask and it shall be what? So when God say ask, &gt;&gt; it means it's already there &gt;&gt; and it's available to be given to you. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Why? Why? Why is God saying asking if it's not there? &gt;&gt; When God say ask what he told you to ask is already there. &gt;&gt; And God is specific. &gt;&gt; Ask jewels of what? Silver &gt;&gt; and water &gt;&gt; and watering. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 36. And the Lord gave the people what? &gt;&gt; Favor. &gt;&gt; Who gave favor? &gt;&gt; The Lord. &gt;&gt; So when God as tells you to ask, &gt;&gt; what what have God already put on you? &gt;&gt; Favor. favor to receive what you are about to ask. &gt;&gt; Are we together, sister Lily? &gt;&gt; If God say ask &gt;&gt; and it shall be what? &gt;&gt; Because there is an anointing &gt;&gt; there is a favor. &gt;&gt; So when everybody's crying in Egypt, &gt;&gt; some people are happy &gt;&gt; because the season has come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In one side of the same place, it's darkness. &gt;&gt; It's mooning. &gt;&gt; People are sad. People are crying. But on the other side, on the other hand, &gt;&gt; amen. Of the same place, some are rejoicing &gt;&gt; because their bills have been wiped out. When somebody is talking about the economy and the tariffs going higher, somebody else is having bills wiped out without paying a penny. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; A season on the other side of darkness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This season is between the It's before right before the Exodus. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; When it's too dark, &gt;&gt; when death is in the land, &gt;&gt; but the exodus has not happened yet. &gt;&gt; In that season, &gt;&gt; that's a great deal, brother. &gt;&gt; In that time, &gt;&gt; you need to watch. &gt;&gt; You need to open up your eyes &gt;&gt; because there is two anointing that are working. &gt;&gt; One is working in Egypt, &gt;&gt; in the world, and another one is in Gan. &gt;&gt; Are we together? So if you are in gosh, don't be looking at the news of Egypt. &gt;&gt; Change your news channel. &gt;&gt; Stop looking at CNN. &gt;&gt; Stop looking at the news. &gt;&gt; Turn to Malachi 4 news. &gt;&gt; Malachi 4 will tell you what need to be taken at this time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Sister ROF, try to adjust my ear here on on my on my monitor, please, if you can. And Sister Adas, you can refocus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible say, "And the Lord gave the people what? &gt;&gt; Favor &gt;&gt; in the sight of what? &gt;&gt; The Egyptians." &gt;&gt; So that they did what? &gt;&gt; Lent unto them such things. &gt;&gt; They gave unto them such things as the water &gt;&gt; required. &gt;&gt; And they did what? &gt;&gt; Spoiled the Egyptians. Do you know the very word spoil means what? &gt;&gt; It means there was a war. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You don't take spoil just like that. &gt;&gt; There is first a war &gt;&gt; and you want the war then you go and you plunder &gt;&gt; and you take and you spoil. You take the spoil. &gt;&gt; But who who fight who fought this war? [Music] &gt;&gt; So the battle is not yours. You are not there to fight. &gt;&gt; You are there to reap the benefit of the one who fought on Calvary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The one who climbed on Calvary is not you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's the one that got all the beating so that you you can be made free. &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible say he became poor [Applause] &gt;&gt; so that we can be made what? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; The thing that Israel was asking, did they work for it? &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; Did they pay for it? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Did they invest for it? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Did they sweat for it? &gt;&gt; So, who was working? &gt;&gt; So, who worked for those things? &gt;&gt; The Egyptian. Who worked for it? &gt;&gt; Who bought it? &gt;&gt; Egyptian. &gt;&gt; Who invested? &gt;&gt; Egyptians. So the Egyptian were working for Israel. [Applause] &gt;&gt; My friend, are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? So God gave them favor &gt;&gt; to accumulate. &gt;&gt; Do you believe the Bible? [Music] &gt;&gt; I have not left the airport yet.

This is the portion of who &gt;&gt; a wicked man. &gt;&gt; Are you wicked here? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Is anybody wicked here? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; So this is not your portion. &gt;&gt; But I just need to be informed about the portion of the wicked. &gt;&gt; Why do you need it? There could be a blessing in the wicked portion. &gt;&gt; We just saw here that when the wicked work me I'm sleeping. &gt;&gt; Don't worry my friend.

You know that who was oppressing Israel? The Egyptian. &gt;&gt; So now this is the portion of the Egyptian. And the and the heritage of the water &gt;&gt; oppressors &gt;&gt; which they shall receive of who? &gt;&gt; The Almighty. So the wicked and the people that are oppressing you, that give you hard time, &gt;&gt; that are tormenting me all the time, they have an an inheritance and a portion. I'm not going to read all of them, but I'm trying to knock what is right here. You can read it at home. Job to verse 16. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Though he does what? The wicked &gt;&gt; heap up silver as the dust. &gt;&gt; And though he heap up silver as what? &gt;&gt; The dust. &gt;&gt; Though he up silver as the dust. Though he up &gt;&gt; the death. &gt;&gt; So this man is very rich. &gt;&gt; He's working his head off. &gt;&gt; He cannot sleep &gt;&gt; all the time. He's in his computer. &gt;&gt; He's working. If you look at him, he's a rich man. Let's see what is he working for. He said though he up silver as the what? &gt;&gt; The dust &gt;&gt; and prepare what? &gt;&gt; Raymond &gt;&gt; as what? &gt;&gt; The clay &gt;&gt; so many clothing. Verse 17. He may prepare it. &gt;&gt; Come on. But the just shall do what? &gt;&gt; Put it on. &gt;&gt; So, who's going to wear the clothing? &gt;&gt; I'm going with the Bible. &gt;&gt; Who's going to who's going to wear the clothing? &gt;&gt; So, who's putting up the clothing? &gt;&gt; Now, you understand why God told the Egyp the Israelite, "Go get the clothing." &gt;&gt; He says that it's the just who does what &gt;&gt; put it on. And the innocent shall divide the what? &gt;&gt; Silver. &gt;&gt; So the the wife of the riches is put for who? &gt;&gt; For the righteous one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Free. &gt;&gt; To believe &gt;&gt; or to reject. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go back where we were. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse 36. And the Lord gave them what? &gt;&gt; Favor &gt;&gt; in the sight of what? &gt;&gt; The Egyptians. &gt;&gt; So that they l to them such things as the water &gt;&gt; required. &gt;&gt; And they spoiled the Egyptian. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now when they pick up these jewels of silver &gt;&gt; and the jeweler of gold and his clothing on remnant, what did they do with it &gt;&gt; when they were leaving Egypt? Because they didn't start building the tabernacle right away. So God was picking up that. So according to us, the way we are very humble, maybe when they pick up the the the jewels of silver, you know what? We going into the wilderness. What are we going to do with it? Just keep it keep it here. So we see what the Lord will tell us what to do with it &gt;&gt; according to us. &gt;&gt; Because we don't need silver, brother. We don't need gold. We don't what I have is okay. Ah, I don't need I don't need any more clothing. I have enough. I don't need it. I'm okay. Let's see who what was the purpose of God in picking up this thing. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Go to Exodus 3. &gt;&gt; I'm still reading the Bible. We going to climb soon. Amen. &gt;&gt; Go to Exodus 3. If you there, you can say amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, Exodus 3 is when God met Moses as a pillar on fire. &gt;&gt; In a burning bush. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, God is talking to Moses. You there? &gt;&gt; Exodus 3, if you there, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 21, God said to Moses, I will give this people what? &gt;&gt; Favor. &gt;&gt; Do you see that? &gt;&gt; In the sight of what? &gt;&gt; The Egyptians. And it shall come to pass that when you go &gt;&gt; you shall not go how &gt;&gt; empty. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to the word? &gt;&gt; So God didn't want Israel to leave Egypt empty. &gt;&gt; It's hard. &gt;&gt; It's hard. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's hard. continue to work overtime, &gt;&gt; continue to work three job and you're missing church, you're missing question and answer, you're missing church, you're missing uh I mean merit couple me because of your work and you're fine. &gt;&gt; You are happy &gt;&gt; and you call that it trials. &gt;&gt; It's your own trial. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God did not want Israel to leave how. So who was providing for Israel? &gt;&gt; We clear so far. &gt;&gt; Are we clear? &gt;&gt; Next verse. Verse 22. But every what? &gt;&gt; Woman, &gt;&gt; sister. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Shall do what? &gt;&gt; Borrow of her neighbor. &gt;&gt; Ask for from who? &gt;&gt; Neighbor. &gt;&gt; From neighborama. And of her that in what? &gt;&gt; Her house. &gt;&gt; In other words, if the neighbor have a visitor, &gt;&gt; you Hey, &gt;&gt; can we read together? &gt;&gt; Not only so now there is an exception. &gt;&gt; He was not only Egyptian. &gt;&gt; Whoever was a resident [Applause] &gt;&gt; in Egypt &gt;&gt; was also subject &gt;&gt; to work for Israel. &gt;&gt; In other words, when you go to the house, &gt;&gt; you say, "I know you an American, &gt;&gt; but I saw a brother that came somebody came from Italy. Even him too. &gt;&gt; Whoever came from Africa, him too. &gt;&gt; Whoever came from another country, &gt;&gt; even him too. &gt;&gt; In other words, not only Egyptian but even the resident, &gt;&gt; the stranger that were in Egypt, &gt;&gt; God already trapped all of them. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? So your bank God has extended now. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ah, &gt;&gt; spiritual people. But every woman shall borrow of what? &gt;&gt; Her neighbor &gt;&gt; and and of her that did what? &gt;&gt; To journeth in her house. &gt;&gt; Borrow what? &gt;&gt; Jewels of silver. &gt;&gt; We know that. And what? &gt;&gt; Jewels of gold. &gt;&gt; And what? &gt;&gt; And Raymond. &gt;&gt; And you shall put them upon who? &gt;&gt; Your sons. &gt;&gt; Say amen. It's the Bible. You shall put on upon who? &gt;&gt; Your sons &gt;&gt; and who? &gt;&gt; Your daughters. &gt;&gt; And you shall do what? &gt;&gt; For the Egyptians. &gt;&gt; So the the wealth the blessing God is giving you, &gt;&gt; it's it's it's extended to who? [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; You didn't get that. Well, &gt;&gt; God is telling you go get the wealth. &gt;&gt; But the wealth is going to who? So when they were leaving Egypt, how was Israel dressed? &gt;&gt; Please answer me. &gt;&gt; We trying to move on. &gt;&gt; The poor children &gt;&gt; of the slave. Now they look how &gt;&gt; rich &gt;&gt; are we together? &gt;&gt; So your blessing is going down to your children. &gt;&gt; Are we together? So when Israel is walking out &gt;&gt; and they look at the children maybe the friend ask why do you look so good &gt;&gt; so the child have a testimony &gt;&gt; he say you know what my father serve the living God &gt;&gt; and because of that that's why I look like this &gt;&gt; I hope we are together &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; I hope we are together &gt;&gt; I hope we are together &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; your father didn't get the money yet &gt;&gt; but you got the money at the end. &gt;&gt; Maybe your father was not smart in school, &gt;&gt; but because he serve a living God, &gt;&gt; your grade in school, brother Elijah must be a testimony. &gt;&gt; When the people are looking at our children, why are you having a daddy serve a living God? Because my father serve a living God. The testimony goes to the next generation. [Applause] Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So God is providing for the entire family. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This happened slightly before the Exodus &gt;&gt; when everybody else is crying there. &gt;&gt; Listen to this my friend. Then we move to our second our third scripture in the Psalm 104 105 verse 37. The Bible says what? &gt;&gt; He brought them forth also. &gt;&gt; He brought Israel forth also with what? &gt;&gt; With silver and gold. &gt;&gt; We already seen that. And there was not &gt;&gt; in the wilderness when they were leaving Egypt. &gt;&gt; There was not what? &gt;&gt; One feeble person among their tribes. &gt;&gt; Not one. &gt;&gt; So everybody was healthy. There is [Music] &gt;&gt; Let me read it again. &gt;&gt; We're talking about Exodus. &gt;&gt; Remember what happened in the first Exodus was under the pillar of fire. It came to the second exodus. And that same pillar of fire came into the third Exodus. And Jesus Christ is the same &gt;&gt; yesterday, today and forever. &gt;&gt; So what happened over there must happen here. I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; In other words, before we leave this world, &gt;&gt; no sickness, &gt;&gt; no sickness, &gt;&gt; not a trace of sickness must be found in our body. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? That's why we receive glorified body &gt;&gt; because sickness must leave. God must send the healing anointing &gt;&gt; because the son of righteousness is rising with healing &gt;&gt; in his wings. &gt;&gt; So no one s &gt;&gt; No one should be what? &gt;&gt; If you believe it, say amen. &gt;&gt; I didn't hear it from this side. &gt;&gt; If you believe it, say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even if you sick, say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't look at the symptom. Look at the word. &gt;&gt; You said so. I believe it. And I said it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; The brother not feeble. Sisters not feeble. children, &gt;&gt; everybody healthy. &gt;&gt; Are we clear? &gt;&gt; Let's go to Isaiah 60. &gt;&gt; This is our last scripture. Then you turn your clock and we start preaching. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry if you got a lot of tummy like this. We need to stretch it. If you need the quote, you see me. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 60. If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse one. Arise. You remember this. &gt;&gt; And do what? &gt;&gt; Shine. &gt;&gt; Arise means you were not standing. &gt;&gt; You already understand that. &gt;&gt; And do what? &gt;&gt; Shine. &gt;&gt; So you were not shining. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Arise and shine. Why? &gt;&gt; For thy light is come. &gt;&gt; The light of who? &gt;&gt; The light of who? &gt;&gt; Thy light. &gt;&gt; Your light has come. &gt;&gt; Is it the light of brother Charles? &gt;&gt; It is my light. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Brother CH have to apply the scripture to himself. &gt;&gt; God is saying &gt;&gt; eras. &gt;&gt; He didn't say and shine the light. &gt;&gt; Because shine the light means you taking like a flashlight and you begin to shine. Uhuh. Uhuh. Uh-uh. The flashlight is not you. &gt;&gt; God is saying your light. So there is a light that belong to you. &gt;&gt; And your light have come. &gt;&gt; And when your light come, you now are shining. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible say, "Arise and do what?" &gt;&gt; Shine. &gt;&gt; Why? Because thy light has water. &gt;&gt; It's come. &gt;&gt; Remember last Sunday we saw in first uh John 1 verse 5 that the Bible says this then is the message. I'm just catching up something. Which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is what? &gt;&gt; Light. God is what? &gt;&gt; Light. &gt;&gt; So God is light. &gt;&gt; Oh, light &gt;&gt; is what? &gt;&gt; Yeah, you will struggle but I don't have any choice. Amen. And in him in God there is what? &gt;&gt; No darkness at all. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the characteristic of God, if you open God, you look inside. &gt;&gt; No darkness. &gt;&gt; It's all light. &gt;&gt; Thank you. In Revelation 22, when we So the Bible say, "And the city has no need of what? &gt;&gt; The sun. &gt;&gt; Neither of what? &gt;&gt; The moon &gt;&gt; to do what? &gt;&gt; To shine in it." &gt;&gt; Why? For because the water &gt;&gt; the glory of God &gt;&gt; is doing what? the light &gt;&gt; and the lamp is what? &gt;&gt; The light thereof. &gt;&gt; So they don't need the light because there is already a light &gt;&gt; but the light is a person. &gt;&gt; Because the lamb is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; John the Baptist said, "Behold the lamb of God." &gt;&gt; So the lamb is the light. So God is light &gt;&gt; and that light is the lamp. So light is lamb and light is God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Now the Bible say arise and shine &gt;&gt; for what? &gt;&gt; Your light has come. &gt;&gt; But light is what? &gt;&gt; If your light has come, &gt;&gt; what have come to you? [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Because Jesus say my sheep. &gt;&gt; He he already call you sheep. If he call you sheep &gt;&gt; and the scripture say in Psalm 82, ye are what? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Now the Bible say arise and do what? &gt;&gt; For what has come. &gt;&gt; So your God, your your divine portion &gt;&gt; has come. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? The Bible says in the book of James that God James chapter one probably 17 the Bible say that God is the father of what? &gt;&gt; Lights plural. So a father of light give birth to what? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So he will give birth to the light like in the day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; It was the father that was giving birth. &gt;&gt; He said this one is Charles. This one is Greg. This one is uh Kayla. This one, it's the father of light. And the Bible say now rise &gt;&gt; and shine because your light, &gt;&gt; your godship, [Music] &gt;&gt; your God part, [Applause] &gt;&gt; your deity has come. &gt;&gt; Your deity. In other words, you have a portion of you that is God. &gt;&gt; But now that portion has come. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; He said, "Arise and shine. The light has what? &gt;&gt; Come &gt;&gt; and the glory of the Lord has th &gt;&gt; is risen upon thee." &gt;&gt; For behold, what? &gt;&gt; The darkness shall cover the earth. &gt;&gt; Why do you need to shine? What is coming down on the earth? &gt;&gt; Darkness. &gt;&gt; So God is sending what? &gt;&gt; Light. So when darkness is coming down, what else is coming down? [Music] &gt;&gt; In other words, the moving [Music] &gt;&gt; that's why brother Brandham say when you recognize this message &gt;&gt; to be eagleful you heard from who? &gt;&gt; So where is that theophony? &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. I hope we are together. So at the same time darkness is coming. &gt;&gt; No, in other words, God is responding to what is happening. &gt;&gt; Satan is coming down. God also is coming down. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The God I'm talking is your God is coming down. &gt;&gt; Not the God of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Your your your God. &gt;&gt; Your God is also coming down. My God is different than your God. &gt;&gt; My God look like me. &gt;&gt; He fits me. [Applause] &gt;&gt; It's a It's another brother Steven. &gt;&gt; It's a divine person. When he get to me, he's charging you. &gt;&gt; Now I become a light. [Applause] I don't know if you together. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you together. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; In other words, you are living without a battery. &gt;&gt; Your battery has come. &gt;&gt; Put your battery on. &gt;&gt; Turn the cell phone on. &gt;&gt; Shout because the battery has come. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So at the same time, darkness is coming. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lights also &gt;&gt; are coming. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So depending on where are you looking at? &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; What do you see? Darkness. Darkness. Darkness. Darkness. What do you see also? [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Let's continue. Verse two. For behold what? &gt;&gt; The darkness shall cover the earth. &gt;&gt; What type of darkness? &gt;&gt; Gross darkness. &gt;&gt; If the darkness are gross. &gt;&gt; So for a light to shine on a gross darkness, what intensity &gt;&gt; should be that light? &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; I don't know why it's difficult. &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. &gt;&gt; You see this picture right here? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. If you if you look uh look brother Brham is doing what? Look at his face. Look at him. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham is doing what? &gt;&gt; That that light above him is doing what? &gt;&gt; What is around all of them? &gt;&gt; What do you see in that picture? &gt;&gt; What is around that picture? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you see something here? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Do you see something here? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Can you tell what is there? &gt;&gt; Can you tell what is here? &gt;&gt; But you can tell this individual &gt;&gt; and these are clearly defined. &gt;&gt; Arise and shine &gt;&gt; because his light has come and the glory of the Lord is risen above you. [Applause] This is your picture right there. The glory of the Lord. But I am also a light. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. So in that picture there are two light. &gt;&gt; It is the glory of the Lord. But brother also is a light &gt;&gt; just like you are a light. &gt;&gt; But if you look around them, guess what? darkness. &gt;&gt; If I ask you what do you see in that picture? &gt;&gt; You will say I see who. &gt;&gt; Somebody will say I see who. &gt;&gt; None of you will answer me that I see darkness. &gt;&gt; None of you will answer me darkness. &gt;&gt; None of you will answer me darkness. All of you will say I see brother with the pillar of fire. Why didn't you see darkness? But it's there. &gt;&gt; So darkness is not really catching you. &gt;&gt; What is catching you is the image &gt;&gt; of the light &gt;&gt; and the prophet &gt;&gt; because the light and the prophet speak to you [Music] &gt;&gt; because I will send you Elijah. I will send you &gt;&gt; Elijah the prophet. &gt;&gt; So there is a light. There is you and there is Elijah the prophet. I hope we are together. I hope we are together. Arise and shine. The light has come. Verse two. For behold, they what? &gt;&gt; The darkness &gt;&gt; shall do what? &gt;&gt; Cover the earth &gt;&gt; and gross water. &gt;&gt; Darkness the people. &gt;&gt; But the Lord shall arise upon who? &gt;&gt; Thee. &gt;&gt; Where is that pillar of fire? &gt;&gt; Upon who? &gt;&gt; Upon thee. &gt;&gt; Upon who? &gt;&gt; Upon me.

And the Lord shall ar remember yesterday in question and answer. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Because some of you want to see &gt;&gt; those that were yesterday knows what I'm talking about when we talked about perception. Do you know that this pillar of fire nobody saw it? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Do you know that nobody saw it? &gt;&gt; It was seen through the camera. &gt;&gt; So why do you want to see your light in your eyes with your eyes? It's there. [Applause] &gt;&gt; It's there. &gt;&gt; It's another dimension. Remember yesterday, it's another dimension. &gt;&gt; Don't worry, my friend. Sooner you will begin to take picture and you will see lights. [Music] &gt;&gt; Because when the rapture will come, I will see him coming. I leave it alone &gt;&gt; because you you you need to know how will the rapture happen &gt;&gt; and what's going to happen even when you sleep you will know I have coat and everything laid up &gt;&gt; are we together he says and gross darkness upon the people but the lord shall arise upon who &gt;&gt; thee &gt;&gt; and his glory shall be seen where &gt;&gt; upon thee &gt;&gt; so when you see brother Brandham what do you see &gt;&gt; glory &gt;&gt; the glory of the lord upon who &gt;&gt; him &gt;&gt; and what happened to the messenger is an example &gt;&gt; because it's the wave chief that have been waved upon the people. &gt;&gt; So that the remaining of the audience &gt;&gt; must be the same. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? We found out that this prophecy of Isaiah 60, brother Brandham say it pertain to our day. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; The Bible I mean brother Brandham say gross darkness where &gt;&gt; of of of course this is a prophesying of the day that we are living when &gt;&gt; now &gt;&gt; I'm not going to go back again because we gave a full picture last Sunday. Let me touch it up and get to what we are supposed to get. Amen. We found out that brother Brham say where it is strange but it's in this age of what? &gt;&gt; Plenty. &gt;&gt; An age of what? Opportunity &gt;&gt; age of what? &gt;&gt; Plenty. &gt;&gt; And what? &gt;&gt; Opportunity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's move on quickly. Brother Brham say when everyone has water &gt;&gt; so much &gt;&gt; and there is what &gt;&gt; so much more to be had. &gt;&gt; What with all the water &gt;&gt; inventions &gt;&gt; to do our work dishwasher whatever and so many thing to give us what &gt;&gt; pleasure. Suddenly we found what &gt;&gt; mental illness &gt;&gt; taking such a toll as what &gt;&gt; to alarm the nation &gt;&gt; when everybody ought to be happy with really nothing to be unhappy about but million are taking what &gt;&gt; seditives at night. &gt;&gt; If you taking sedative at night &gt;&gt; we must seize it &gt;&gt; because there must be a difference between you and the people of the world. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Put the tape on. &gt;&gt; Cut brother tape on &gt;&gt; and focus a little be on the tape. &gt;&gt; Before you know it, you already gone. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? He says sedative at night and what? &gt;&gt; Pet pills in the morning. So you need something to boost you in the morning. &gt;&gt; Really, you need something to boost you in the morning. &gt;&gt; Find the season, my friend. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't need to take something to boost me in the morning because my light has come. &gt;&gt; My children has come. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham continue. He says, "Rushing to what? &gt;&gt; The doctors &gt;&gt; entering what? &gt;&gt; Institutions &gt;&gt; trying to drone out unknown fear by what? alcohol &gt;&gt; and yet the bo that of this tremendous store of wly good but the people are less water &gt;&gt; happy than ever &gt;&gt; this age boasts of water &gt;&gt; it's spiritual attainment &gt;&gt; but the people are less sure of themsel than what &gt;&gt; we talked about last Sunday this age boast of what &gt;&gt; better moral value &gt;&gt; and it's more corrupt than any age sees what &gt;&gt; the flood &gt;&gt; and God put you in this more in the more corrupted &gt;&gt; that's where God put you Because you have a light &gt;&gt; that must shine but your light require gross darkness. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Let's continue. Brother Brham says this. He says and he says the next verse will be to the other churches. This is a decent church commanding other churches. God command them. I know your work. I know what you did. I know this and there. He said, but he did not command this church. &gt;&gt; Laisha, there is nothing to praise him. &gt;&gt; If you go to the book of Revelation from the beginning of Laodisha all the way to the end, it's just rebuke after rebuke after rebuke. There is nothing God praises the age. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say he didn't command this age. He had just what? &gt;&gt; Complain against it. &gt;&gt; Not a command. He didn't command this age for what? &gt;&gt; Nothing. &gt;&gt; Which age? a bad age, &gt;&gt; nothing to praise, &gt;&gt; the edge, &gt;&gt; nothing. &gt;&gt; And we found out last Sunday that under the seventh seal, remember this. Now, back up, my friend. Under the seventh seal, there was a losing &gt;&gt; of an ekles, a demonic spirit &gt;&gt; was given permission under the seven seal. &gt;&gt; Are we are we together? to darken the moon or the church. &gt;&gt; Don't worry, my friend. The Bible say, notice the losing of this what? &gt;&gt; Ecclesiastical spirit. &gt;&gt; Now, 20 years later after that war, we already talked about it. We see the losing of which spirit? &gt;&gt; The ecclesiastical spirit. &gt;&gt; What? Under &gt;&gt; the seventh seal, &gt;&gt; the seventh trumpet to the what? &gt;&gt; To the Jew. &gt;&gt; In other words, this seal, this message here must go to the Jews. And remember when he goes to the Jews, it's in the tribulation period. &gt;&gt; It looks like this message work in trouble. [Applause] &gt;&gt; When the devil is coming really high, &gt;&gt; the the the the remedy, &gt;&gt; the answer is this message. [Applause] A season on the other side of darkness. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say look at the moon which is the church doing what? &gt;&gt; Darkening out. &gt;&gt; Where under? See it Jonah the son of man being what? &gt;&gt; Drove from the church. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; And look at this my friend. Brother Brham says we are living in a what? &gt;&gt; Neurotic age &gt;&gt; with what? &gt;&gt; Nervous tension. Everybody is racing here &gt;&gt; and going there and going where? &gt;&gt; Nowhere. &gt;&gt; It's just to that kind of an age. And I know this church &gt;&gt; br tabernacle would be what? &gt;&gt; Plagued with it. &gt;&gt; As what? &gt;&gt; As everywhere &gt;&gt; is plagued with it.

And God put you in a tension age. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Tension a bad thing. &gt;&gt; Let me continue. Brother Brandham says this. He says it's a day of what? &gt;&gt; Pleasure. &gt;&gt; What's going on? &gt;&gt; Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry up and do what? &gt;&gt; Wait. drive 90 m an hour and then get home for what supper and wait how many hours? &gt;&gt; 2 hours till it gets ready &gt;&gt; on the highway. &gt;&gt; Get home. You start waiting. What is going on? Pressure. Follow me my friend. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say that's right. It is what &gt;&gt; a time &gt;&gt; and it's that rushing of what &gt;&gt; and speeding. &gt;&gt; It gets you to a water &gt;&gt; a nervous tension. The wife says something a little contrary. You want to do what? &gt;&gt; Fly off. &gt;&gt; The husband says something, you pat your foot &gt;&gt; and tell him what? &gt;&gt; To get in the room. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't move. Stay in the sanctuary. &gt;&gt; Let me handle this. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; It looks like argument every day. &gt;&gt; No conversation without argument. Who put you in the guard? &gt;&gt; Follow me my friend. &gt;&gt; Follow me my friend. Brother Brown say well now husband I don't want no word with you &gt;&gt; go. &gt;&gt; And wife say what? &gt;&gt; I'm so nervous. &gt;&gt; I am so nervous. Some of us are like &gt;&gt; are we together? Brother say why? &gt;&gt; What's the matter? &gt;&gt; Can I continue? &gt;&gt; This is the matter. Brother say some people try to do what? &gt;&gt; Introduce Christianity &gt;&gt; that you are free from what? &gt;&gt; Worry. &gt;&gt; No, you are not &gt;&gt; season where &gt;&gt; on the other side of darkness. &gt;&gt; Don't worry my friend, we getting there. Brother say you are not &gt;&gt; slow down. I know. Swallow. Just swallow. Swallow. &gt;&gt; And we coming there. Amen. Brother Brandham say you are not. You are free from what? &gt;&gt; Tension. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say what? &gt;&gt; Oh no. &gt;&gt; Oh no. You do what? &gt;&gt; Tension. &gt;&gt; When you become what? &gt;&gt; A Christian. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me continue. My friend brother said because you was kind of what &gt;&gt; a stop go &gt;&gt; and what &gt;&gt; happy go &gt;&gt; whatever he was out there not caring about what you did. &gt;&gt; You can just catch somebody and go. &gt;&gt; You see somebody on the highway stick a finger move on. You don't even remember you stick a finger. But when you become a Christian &gt;&gt; suddenly tension &gt;&gt; but remember the only burden. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; That is a tension sir &gt;&gt; or a stone &gt;&gt; to go higher is an eagle. [Applause] You didn't get me, my friend. &gt;&gt; Paul was the anointing of a lion. &gt;&gt; The dark ages were the anointing of an ox. &gt;&gt; The reformer were the anointing of a man. &gt;&gt; But this anointing today is the anointing of what? &gt;&gt; Not just an eagle, a what? &gt;&gt; Flying and flying eagle meets storm. Yes. &gt;&gt; He required dark storm, really dark storm to push the eagle up. &gt;&gt; That's why after every trial, you go higher. &gt;&gt; After every trial, you go higher. &gt;&gt; You didn't get me. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Sister Lily, the faith you have today &gt;&gt; is more than what you had yesterday. Brother say if you don't have that tension you can't move on &gt;&gt; sister if that tension the car the first car didn't break down the second car didn't break down it was the two car that broke down that ro that's like I must take God at his word &gt;&gt; credit to qualify no money for down payment no go outside the car is over [Applause] [Music] Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Sister George, are we together? It took tension. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this. Glory to God. He says, but when you become a what? &gt;&gt; A real Christian. &gt;&gt; Every moment you are just what? &gt;&gt; Wondering. &gt;&gt; Am I pleasing my Lord? &gt;&gt; If I could hear from him, he put you how? &gt;&gt; On tension. &gt;&gt; Put you how? &gt;&gt; On guard. That is what makes you what you are. &gt;&gt; People say you are a sweet person. &gt;&gt; They don't know it takes tension to keep you sweet. &gt;&gt; You a wonderful believer. We never seen an employee like you. It took tension &gt;&gt; so that when you at work every seven you say, "Have I said something wrong? &gt;&gt; Have I done something wrong? I want to make sure I'm always ready." &gt;&gt; Are we together? And it keep you line up. &gt;&gt; You need it. &gt;&gt; Stay in the sanctuary. Don't go anywhere. &gt;&gt; The brother problem say he says what after all tension is what &gt;&gt; a blessing. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; In other words, that darkness that you see around is a blessing. I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; He said tension is water. &gt;&gt; A blessing. &gt;&gt; It's just the way you are water &gt;&gt; looking at it. &gt;&gt; It's just the way you are. What? &gt;&gt; Looking at it. &gt;&gt; If you just look to the other side, no matter how thin you do, what? &gt;&gt; Slice anything. &gt;&gt; You got how many side? &gt;&gt; Two sides.

The other side, I got favor from God &gt;&gt; to get everything I want. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Listen to this, my friend. If you can swallow this. Speaking of what? &gt;&gt; Speaking of what? &gt;&gt; Tension. &gt;&gt; I was praying about it this morning. &gt;&gt; Ah, glory to God. Brother Brandham was praying about tension. So, finally, we got the answer. Let's get the answer that he got after praying for tension. &gt;&gt; Are we ready? &gt;&gt; He said, "I was praying about it this morning. What would you do &gt;&gt; if you didn't have tension?" &gt;&gt; Just think of it. &gt;&gt; Tension is a what? &gt;&gt; Read it, my friend. &gt;&gt; Tension is part of living. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm getting you somewhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Tension is not a curse. It's a fuel. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; When you want to preach here, you will feel it coming up &gt;&gt; because it keep you on your toes. It keep you consecrated. It keep you prayed up all the time because you getting into a different. If not, you will be joking &gt;&gt; and people are waiting to hear from God. &gt;&gt; Are we together? He said tension is what? &gt;&gt; Part of living. &gt;&gt; Tension. Blackness is part of that picture. If you want to see brother bra, &gt;&gt; if you want to see the pillar of fire really good, you need the dark background. &gt;&gt; You need the dark a black background. Then you going to see it clearly. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bradam say he say if that kind of what &gt;&gt; encouraged me when I &gt;&gt; when I thought about it if you had no tension &gt;&gt; you be like a rag doll &gt;&gt; you wouldn't have what &gt;&gt; no feelings &gt;&gt; there be nothing you could work on like a husband and what &gt;&gt; wife &gt;&gt; maybe if she want to do something and they are trying to work together especially who &gt;&gt; Christians &gt;&gt; so who will get more attention &gt;&gt; Christians I hope it's helping you now better. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because when it happen, you go low on your faith. &gt;&gt; You say, "Lord, I'm not I'm not where I'm supposed to be. I'm supposed to be above." No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You need that pressure &gt;&gt; because that pressure put your husband back in place. Yes, it does. Because if a husband does everything and it's yes yes yes yes, he's going to fall on the ditch. &gt;&gt; He need a shook proof &gt;&gt; to send him to spin and think twice and finally he put him. &gt;&gt; Don't say amen. Let me continue. Let me continue. Let me continue. Do you think God put you together for nothing? &gt;&gt; Huh? God put you together so you can say yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. You are there for yes and no. &gt;&gt; No. If it's contrary to the word no. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; He say especially who &gt;&gt; Christians &gt;&gt; and the one and the other ones. And then when you come together you find out that what she's done. She found out. See the tension he do what? &gt;&gt; Close brings you closer together. &gt;&gt; I want to do this. No. No. No, no. Me, I don't see this. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. After My God, she was right. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Honey, I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; You were right. &gt;&gt; He took that &gt;&gt; and the light comes. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; So, the tension really does what? &gt;&gt; Brings you closer together. That's why be careful when you're dealing with married people. &gt;&gt; Even when they mad &gt;&gt; and this one say I can't take no more. &gt;&gt; Last thing I'm leaving tomorrow you see both of them. &gt;&gt; It's like they are playing games. &gt;&gt; If you look you say are you really playing games? You are mad. This one say I don't want him tomorrow honey. I'm sorry. And guess what? more love &gt;&gt; and another baby. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? And where is the devil after all? &gt;&gt; And you see them 30 years marriage, 40 years marriage. They were tension in between, but they can't separate. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together, &gt;&gt; brother? &gt;&gt; Have I said something wrong? &gt;&gt; Anyway, it's the word of God. Shake somebody beside you. &gt;&gt; This is the word of God. Whoever is making you sleep is the devil. &gt;&gt; Because you don't sleep at hard. &gt;&gt; You don't sleep at work. You don't sleep at the party. So you can't sleep right here. [Music] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Brother say, "And somebody tells you that well, just think of the little wife that went under a lot of tension when you was not good and the husband went under a lot of tension when you was not good. &gt;&gt; Then when it's all forgiven, look how you feel about him. My &gt;&gt; you got to have &gt;&gt; tension &gt;&gt; brother Bradom. So tension. Oh my. What is this tension? If I could have been born without this tension. Well if I would have had this tension if I would not have distension I would have been what I I would not have been what I am. &gt;&gt; I would not have been a Christian perhaps. It was this tension &gt;&gt; that drove me to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It's been a blessing thing to me &gt;&gt; brother Steven. &gt;&gt; So you are saying blessing tension is good &gt;&gt; are we together? When we look at Psalm last Sunday, we found that David said, "The Lord does what?" &gt;&gt; Reignth. &gt;&gt; And let the earth do what? &gt;&gt; Rejoice. &gt;&gt; Let the multitude of shel be what? &gt;&gt; Glad thereof. &gt;&gt; Cloud and what? &gt;&gt; And darkness. &gt;&gt; And where? &gt;&gt; Round about him. &gt;&gt; Even God himself. &gt;&gt; According to David, around God, what do we see? &gt;&gt; Darkness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How can light himself? God is light. &gt;&gt; And around him there is what? Darkness, &gt;&gt; cloud and darkness. &gt;&gt; What is the purpose of darkness? &gt;&gt; Psalm uh 139 David continue. He said, "If I say surely the darkness shall do what?" &gt;&gt; Cover me. &gt;&gt; Even the night shall be light about me. &gt;&gt; Why? Because there is a light in David &gt;&gt; that no matter how much darkness you put, &gt;&gt; it turn everything into light. &gt;&gt; Are we together? And David say, "Yeah, the darkness hideth not from thee, from God. But the night shineth as what?" &gt;&gt; The day. &gt;&gt; The darkness and the light are both a light to who? &gt;&gt; To thee. &gt;&gt; In other words, to God. Whether you put darkness or you put light, it doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God doesn't see darkness the way you see &gt;&gt; it. &gt;&gt; Because the one who created darkness is God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right there, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. to God. Darkness and light are the same. &gt;&gt; And you are God. &gt;&gt; So you need to change it the way you look in a darkness. &gt;&gt; Darkness to God is just as the light. &gt;&gt; In other words, darkness is not a reason to for God to stop what he's doing. &gt;&gt; Darkness is not an obstacle. &gt;&gt; It's not a hindrance. &gt;&gt; It is nothing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Some of us working in the in the day. &gt;&gt; Some of us work at night. &gt;&gt; Did the night hinder you from working? You who work night shift? &gt;&gt; It didn't do anything. &gt;&gt; So if you work night shift, what is night to you? &gt;&gt; What is night for you? &gt;&gt; When we are going to sleep, what happened to you? [Music] And and then when it's day, when it's day, when it's day, what is day now for you? &gt;&gt; They did change anything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did you say that because it's night, I'm not going to get a paycheck? &gt;&gt; So paycheck can come in the day &gt;&gt; and paycheck can come where? &gt;&gt; You did that naturally. You didn't care about the day and the night. But when it come to your spiritual work, &gt;&gt; when darkness come, you stop. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Remember this. This is where we stop. &gt;&gt; I'm so happy to know this one thing, friend. That what? &gt;&gt; Christianity &gt;&gt; has what? &gt;&gt; No negative thing to it. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean darkness is not there. &gt;&gt; But even if you see darkness, &gt;&gt; remind the darkness. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; That in my life &gt;&gt; everything is positive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me start it again. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you meet day, you say good morning day. &gt;&gt; Good to be in my life. &gt;&gt; If you meet darkness, you say, "Oh, so you coming in my life. Good morning." &gt;&gt; Because you going to be changed in a day. &gt;&gt; Because you come to a point to you came to a channel where everything that come this way is always plus. &gt;&gt; That's why all things Work together. &gt;&gt; Work to get all things &gt;&gt; not something. All things &gt;&gt; in your life work together for what? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Brother say you remember that Christianity has what? &gt;&gt; No negative nothing to it. &gt;&gt; It's everything absolutely how &gt;&gt; positive. &gt;&gt; A man that become a child of God has a what? &gt;&gt; A positive hold on Calvary. &gt;&gt; And Calvary has a what? &gt;&gt; A positive hold on him. H with the assurance by who? &gt;&gt; Almighty God. &gt;&gt; By enough by himself &gt;&gt; that he will raise him up where &gt;&gt; in the last days &gt;&gt; and take him where? &gt;&gt; To glory. &gt;&gt; There is not if &gt;&gt; or what? &gt;&gt; And &gt;&gt; or what? &gt;&gt; Or nothing. &gt;&gt; It's something that is how &gt;&gt; positive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Steven, I'm going through trial. It's positive. &gt;&gt; I am sick. It's positive. &gt;&gt; I don't have money. It's positive. &gt;&gt; Because it's an opportunity for God to show his power. &gt;&gt; So it's positive. &gt;&gt; Let's continue. My friend, brother Brandham say he was wounded for what? &gt;&gt; Our transgression. &gt;&gt; Bruised for our what? &gt;&gt; Iniquity. &gt;&gt; Tastement of our peace was where? &gt;&gt; Upon him. &gt;&gt; With his trap, we were what? &gt;&gt; Healed. &gt;&gt; Everything is how? &gt;&gt; Past tense. &gt;&gt; There is no negative at all in Christianity. It is all water &gt;&gt; positive &gt;&gt; water &gt;&gt; done paid for. &gt;&gt; It is how &gt;&gt; finished &gt;&gt; and what? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So whether there is gross darkness &gt;&gt; upon the people it's not a problem. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; That's why brother says this. Now it is strange thing that this is so much thought of people. They say well I am what &gt;&gt; weak &gt;&gt; my faith is not what &gt;&gt; very much &gt;&gt; I am not very good and I'm not a very good what &gt;&gt; Christian &gt;&gt; that is just what the devil want you to say &gt;&gt; a negative language &gt;&gt; your language is positive &gt;&gt; your work is positive sir &gt;&gt; your maneuver is positive &gt;&gt; can you swallow this Your mistake are positive.

A demonic spirit &gt;&gt; that came under the seven se and did what? Darkening the church. &gt;&gt; That was one side. &gt;&gt; That was one side. &gt;&gt; Is correct. &gt;&gt; That was one side. Are we together? Let's turn to the other side. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because when hell broke loose, &gt;&gt; heaven also broke loose. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? When the seven gallles spirit went, but that was not for me. &gt;&gt; That was to darken the church, &gt;&gt; not the bride. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are we together? What happened in my side? In the other side of darkness, &gt;&gt; what is happening with the same seal? Are we together? If you fool, you tell me. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say when the seventh seal is what? &gt;&gt; Broken. &gt;&gt; The mystery of God &gt;&gt; the water &gt;&gt; seal &gt;&gt; in this water &gt;&gt; mysterious seal &gt;&gt; is how &gt;&gt; finished &gt;&gt; until the day that seal is broke. &gt;&gt; And then it reveal what &gt;&gt; what's on the inside of it. The breaking of the seven seal &gt;&gt; make me understand who my maker is. &gt;&gt; That's why every day you begin to understand him more and more. &gt;&gt; You begin to have a not just today you are believing the message but the way you believing now &gt;&gt; when you say amen you're saying a man with understanding &gt;&gt; of who I am. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother say in the seed shall not air with the sh. Say notice but at the opening of water &gt;&gt; the seven seals &gt;&gt; revelation water &gt;&gt; 10 &gt;&gt; the what &gt;&gt; the full word &gt;&gt; is what &gt;&gt; to be born into manifestation again &gt;&gt; and vindicated by what &gt;&gt; the spirit of God &gt;&gt; in how &gt;&gt; in the full strength &gt;&gt; as he was here as he was when he was where &gt;&gt; here on earth &gt;&gt; manifested how &gt;&gt; in the same way &gt;&gt; doing what? &gt;&gt; The same things &gt;&gt; that he did when he was here where &gt;&gt; on earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hebrew 13:8 which say what &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever. So when the seven seal is breaking &gt;&gt; to the people of the earth there the a demon goes there &gt;&gt; but to us Christ come down &gt;&gt; that's why they say rise and shine &gt;&gt; Christ is coming down &gt;&gt; and the word is born again [Applause] &gt;&gt; let's continue my friend listen to this brother Brandham Angels are doing what? &gt;&gt; Appear in the end times. &gt;&gt; All the prophet and the son did what? &gt;&gt; Post. &gt;&gt; Post point to in what? &gt;&gt; This day &gt;&gt; the that angel will do what? &gt;&gt; Appear. &gt;&gt; Prophet will do what? &gt;&gt; Arise. &gt;&gt; Son and what &gt;&gt; and wonders. &gt;&gt; If God did that for those little junction back there, &gt;&gt; what will he do now?

Angels appearing &gt;&gt; and what &gt;&gt; signs and wonders on the earth &gt;&gt; on the earth. &gt;&gt; The counter faith is what &gt;&gt; are rising. &gt;&gt; God is proving who which is what &gt;&gt; right and wrong. &gt;&gt; So God is also pouring out himself. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The seals break &gt;&gt; depending on which side you are. &gt;&gt; If you are in Koshed or in Egypt. In Egypt, a demon goes there. &gt;&gt; In go the anointing of God dropped there. &gt;&gt; Because when hell is broke loose, &gt;&gt; heaven also break loose. &gt;&gt; Because both of those forces must meet together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen to this my friend. Brother, brother say we are facing here in our in our two subject that we read the two scripture rather a very water &gt;&gt; contrast &gt;&gt; if Isaiah 60 on the one on the other hand Isaiah say do what &gt;&gt; arise &gt;&gt; and what &gt;&gt; and shine &gt;&gt; why &gt;&gt; for the glory of God has come upon you &gt;&gt; and the light is where &gt;&gt; is here &gt;&gt; and the next verse he says what &gt;&gt; gross darkness is upon this people &gt;&gt; and then when we are in a mixture of light &gt;&gt; and what &gt;&gt; and darkness. &gt;&gt; And then my address to the church is what? &gt;&gt; Shalom. &gt;&gt; Peace. &gt;&gt; Brother say when they say light is come &gt;&gt; and when they say gross darkness is coming &gt;&gt; what is the message? Brother Brandham say shalom. [Applause] &gt;&gt; In other words, chill out. Shalom. Don't worry. &gt;&gt; It's a great time. &gt;&gt; It's a great season. &gt;&gt; Shalom. &gt;&gt; Peace. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said he didn't say be on your guard. &gt;&gt; The message is what? &gt;&gt; Peace. &gt;&gt; In other word, it's it's outside. I can hear thunder. Boom. And daddy say be calm &gt;&gt; over there. Thunder. Don't worry. &gt;&gt; What does he What is daddy telling you? &gt;&gt; He won't do you anything. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say and the address to the church is what? &gt;&gt; Shalom &gt;&gt; and what? &gt;&gt; Let's find out what it is all about. We are facing what &gt;&gt; this year &gt;&gt; with both what? &gt;&gt; Darkness and light. &gt;&gt; The world is in one of the most chaotic time of darkness that what &gt;&gt; it's ever stood in. &gt;&gt; And yet Amen. &gt;&gt; Season on the other side of darkness. &gt;&gt; In one side the most chaotic &gt;&gt; and yet go ahead my brother. &gt;&gt; It's standing in &gt;&gt; again &gt;&gt; in the most what? &gt;&gt; The blessed light &gt;&gt; that ever did shine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What you call gross darkness. Brother Brandham said that's the best time. what you call great depression. &gt;&gt; A true investor say that's the best time to get &gt;&gt; stuck. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because everything is dropping down. &gt;&gt; They can seize the asset and they can make multi-billion dollar. &gt;&gt; Your disaster is a blessing for them. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Can I continue &gt;&gt; brotherham say if God would have spoke to me back &gt;&gt; before we say now this is bad the worst of all the neurotic age the bad age the losing of an ecclesiastical spirit now they asking brotherham say if God would have spoke to me back before the foundation of the world when I was a touch &gt;&gt; let me leave it alone &gt;&gt; in his mouth mind. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So you're talking to your thought. Let me leave it alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So were you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; If he have said what age &gt;&gt; would you want to live in? &gt;&gt; If I pray you, I put you right here. &gt;&gt; Worst age of all. &gt;&gt; Gross darkness upon the people. Neotic age. Jesus kicked out sodomite, everything going bad. Would you have chose that? &gt;&gt; God knew you wouldn't. &gt;&gt; But God knew what he plac in you. &gt;&gt; So he didn't give you the chance. He just took you and put you there so you can figure it out who you are. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. As you going through trial, finally you realize that wait a minute, I'm not here just like that. &gt;&gt; I was selected for this age. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. And brother Brandham is saying if God would have asked him, &gt;&gt; which church would he come? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say I would have said right now, &gt;&gt; this is it. The most what? &gt;&gt; Glorious time that there is. Listen, &gt;&gt; the most chaotic age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The worst one of all of them, &gt;&gt; the gross darkness. And God and brother is saying, he say it's also the most what? &gt;&gt; Glorious. &gt;&gt; So there is a season on the other side of darkness. When it's too dark, the glory of the Lord came in and made the difference between Egypt and Israel. &gt;&gt; Listen, my friend, brother Brandham say, I am thankful to God to be living in this time of the closing sin of the world. What &gt;&gt; history? I don't know if I would have had a say so before the foundation of the world and if God would have laid out the whole program to me and say to me, I want you to preach and now what age do you desire &gt;&gt; to go to the earth to preach? I would have chosen this age. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; For I think this is a &gt;&gt; the golden age. &gt;&gt; Gross darkness upon the people. &gt;&gt; And you calling that again what? &gt;&gt; The worst age of all. And it become the most glorious one. &gt;&gt; Where are you at? The darkness doesn't mean anything &gt;&gt; compared to the glory that is revealed in that day. &gt;&gt; Are we together, brother? Brother say, I certainly would have loved to have been here during the time of his visit to the earth. &gt;&gt; I'm going to read it again. Brother Brham say I certainly would have loved to have been here during the time of his visit where &gt;&gt; to the earth. &gt;&gt; All of us here if we say when Jesus was in Palestine &gt;&gt; do you want to have been there &gt;&gt; everybody would have say yes &gt;&gt; but listen to brother &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother, brother say I think but still &gt;&gt; I think this right now &gt;&gt; is a greater time. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together &gt;&gt; when he was here on earth. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; He says the work that you shall do &gt;&gt; will be how? So which which time do you want to come when he was here or after him? &gt;&gt; Because after him is when greater is &gt;&gt; because at the cross he say it's finished. &gt;&gt; We need to define what was finished. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not your finish. &gt;&gt; It was finished the work of redemption. &gt;&gt; But there were things he left. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother, don't worry about it. Let's go here. Brother Brandham say, I think this right now is a greater time because it's the a time that he's coming to take what &gt;&gt; the people that he's redeemed &gt;&gt; nearing the water &gt;&gt; resurrection &gt;&gt; when all redeemed will do what? &gt;&gt; Come forth. &gt;&gt; What a glorious water &gt;&gt; opportunity we have &gt;&gt; to speak to a dying people. &gt;&gt; Great time. We are enthused about it. &gt;&gt; Enthused about it. &gt;&gt; Enthused about it. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this. He says, "Oh Christian, what opportunity we have? &gt;&gt; We have what &gt;&gt; opportunities &gt;&gt; that who?" &gt;&gt; St. Paul never dreamed of having. &gt;&gt; We have opportunity that who &gt;&gt; Enoch. &gt;&gt; And who? &gt;&gt; Elijah. &gt;&gt; And who? All of them never had &gt;&gt; the opportunity we have &gt;&gt; now. [Applause] This opportunity is greater than Paul &gt;&gt; is greater than all of them. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? That's why brother say if we can focus ourself to what &gt;&gt; the plan of God &gt;&gt; to what God wants for us &gt;&gt; and what God did what &gt;&gt; promised us &gt;&gt; and let everything else how &gt;&gt; alone &gt;&gt; focus to the plan of God &gt;&gt; don't focus on CNN &gt;&gt; NBC Fox News leave those alone &gt;&gt; that's another side of &gt;&gt; focus in go &gt;&gt; Amen Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Focus to the plan of God &gt;&gt; and focus to what God want for us &gt;&gt; and what God did what &gt;&gt; promised us &gt;&gt; and let everything else how &gt;&gt; alone. &gt;&gt; No matter how long it is just keep on doing &gt;&gt; believing. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't worry flat at 10 and prepare for landing. And that day, in that day, the great anointed church &gt;&gt; was to rise to her what &gt;&gt; power. &gt;&gt; Jesus was to do what? &gt;&gt; Come in. &gt;&gt; When the enemy come in like a what? &gt;&gt; A flood. &gt;&gt; The spirit of the Lord does what? &gt;&gt; Raises up a standard against it. &gt;&gt; And today when science is doing all the different thing, then God is sending down what? &gt;&gt; Supernatural signs &gt;&gt; to show to who? &gt;&gt; His church. Take your mind off the things of the word and do what? &gt;&gt; Look up. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Look up. We are in the what? &gt;&gt; Ladder. Now &gt;&gt; you are anchored both in what? &gt;&gt; In glory. &gt;&gt; And in &gt;&gt; heaven. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Get your mind off what is going on in the world. Don't leave. Don't look at what is in Egypt. &gt;&gt; Listen to Moses. [Music] &gt;&gt; Moses will give you the instruction of the hour for you to get your blessing. &gt;&gt; Don't listen to Jen and Jim. &gt;&gt; Don't listen to Pentecost now. &gt;&gt; They don't know how to define this age. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother, brother, say, and people act how &gt;&gt; funny. &gt;&gt; They seems to just forget about the negative side. &gt;&gt; He's so funny. &gt;&gt; You acting like you don't live in this world. &gt;&gt; It looks like you have forgotten what is going on around. You living like there is nothing bad. &gt;&gt; No, it depends on what you watch on YouTube. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; I'm not in the world over there. &gt;&gt; You the one watching shooting. &gt;&gt; You the one watching murdering. &gt;&gt; You the one watching all about Charlie Kirk. &gt;&gt; Me. I have William Marion brother. &gt;&gt; I'm focusing on something else. And because you watch too much of the outside, you are afraid. &gt;&gt; You are depressed. You don't have faith anymore. &gt;&gt; You know, we need to start storing things because they say the economy is going bad because you listening to that all the time. &gt;&gt; I don't need the economy. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Through the whole through the whole time of Biden, was the economy good? &gt;&gt; No. Did you live? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Did you die? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; So why you keep worrying about economy? &gt;&gt; Before bad, the economy was not good all the time. The economy is not where he's supposed to be doing. &gt;&gt; Did he change your life? &gt;&gt; Did he forbid you for for driving a car for buying a house? So why you quit following the same clock? [Applause] &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; did you hear what's going on on the news? Man, it's going bad. I don't know. We going through a depression. Things are going really, really bad. &gt;&gt; Yes, things are going really, really bad because of where you are tuned in. &gt;&gt; To me, it's a glorious time. &gt;&gt; Because America was already declared in 56 that there was no more redemption. So, I'm not depending on America. I'm depending on the one that came on Sunset Mountain. &gt;&gt; He is everything. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Brother say they act funny. They seems to have forgotten about what &gt;&gt; the negative side &gt;&gt; because they have found an absolute &gt;&gt; because it's what &gt;&gt; the word of God. &gt;&gt; So there is nothing else that I can look at. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We act like we are depending completely in this civilization. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But the people who find the absolute, &gt;&gt; I'm heading to the airport. The people who have found the absolute, &gt;&gt; amen, they don't look at the negative side anymore. &gt;&gt; Get on YouTube. You're going to mess your mind. &gt;&gt; Video all of them. Amen. &gt;&gt; 1.3 million view. &gt;&gt; Stupid stuff. &gt;&gt; Lying. &gt;&gt; They will put a thumbnail that will attract you. You click it, it's not there. &gt;&gt; Before you know it, you are confused. &gt;&gt; You don't even know who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know more about the negative side of this country than how positive the word is to you. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Brother said Jesus say what &gt;&gt; heavens and earth will pass away &gt;&gt; but my word will what &gt;&gt; shall never fail &gt;&gt; but my word shall never fail. So if they got the word of promise &gt;&gt; then there is what? &gt;&gt; No failing to it. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; It cannot fail. So I'm believing that that is what the prayer meeting here &gt;&gt; the religious people of Houston are interested in human lives and that is what we are gathered here for is to call on a what &gt;&gt; a power &gt;&gt; that is how &gt;&gt; beyond all man-made laws and powers &gt;&gt; something who can change the what &gt;&gt; hearts of men &gt;&gt; like he did to what &gt;&gt; pharaoh and Egypt &gt;&gt; and he is what &gt;&gt; God &gt;&gt; and we must stop now &gt;&gt; tell your brother or your sister. We must stop now. &gt;&gt; We need to stop now. What? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; We must stop now what? &gt;&gt; Looking at the negative side. &gt;&gt; Looking at what? &gt;&gt; The negative side. &gt;&gt; And go to looking at the what? &gt;&gt; The positive side. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? Don't talk to me about what is on the street. Don't talk to me about the shooting in Gastonia, the murder that is happening over there. Talk to me about the testimony. &gt;&gt; What God did for you, did for this one, did for this one. Because that is giving me faith. &gt;&gt; It is boosting my faith to know that God is living in the midst of us. [Applause] Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Who are you? A dispatcher of which news? &gt;&gt; They don't even pay you &gt;&gt; to report what you hear on the radio. &gt;&gt; But you are so faithful &gt;&gt; about what is going on in Africa, what is going on in Europe. You know everything, &gt;&gt; but you never finish the church ages. Put your head back to the church ages. Because you will miss the season. &gt;&gt; When it's dark, there is a season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; What are you looking at in your life? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What are you focusing on that drawn you all the time? &gt;&gt; Why are you so depressed? &gt;&gt; Why? because you're looking at something else &gt;&gt; that is not the word of God. &gt;&gt; You focus too much on the negative side of &gt;&gt; Laudisha &gt;&gt; versus looking at the positive side of Laudisha. &gt;&gt; The seven seal to you is not for the egistical spirit. &gt;&gt; It is God himself &gt;&gt; that has come down to meet you. &gt;&gt; That's the seven seal for me. The ecclesiastical spirit is for the pope, not me. To me, my husband has come. The revealed word of the hour has come to meet me. My light has come. The glory of the Lord has risen upon me. Talk to me about what is positive. And there is nothing positive by the word of God. That's why the Bible say be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication. Let your requests be made known unto who? And the peace of God, the shalom of God shall keep your heart and your mind in Jesus Christ. Let everything that is pure, honorable, just let that be the main thing of your meditation. Meditate on the positive because you are positive &gt;&gt; and this church is positive. [Music] &gt;&gt; Your confession positive, your walk positive, your jumping positive, your dancing positive, [Applause] &gt;&gt; my breathing positive, &gt;&gt; my eating is positive. [Applause] Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Why do we miss season in the midst of darkness? &gt;&gt; Because we focus on the negative. &gt;&gt; Because of focusing on the negative, &gt;&gt; this is where the devil get you. He multiply trials &gt;&gt; and you focus on the trial &gt;&gt; and you become away from the real deal. &gt;&gt; When trial come it's nothing. &gt;&gt; Use that bring the master of the trial. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God did not choose you to this age just like that. As much as you don't think you are who you are because some of us think especially sister they think because they don't preach you don't need to be preaching &gt;&gt; at Wright was not preaching &gt;&gt; ameny right was not a preacher &gt;&gt; ate right was not a deacon wife &gt;&gt; she was not a pastor wife &gt;&gt; she was just a simple poor woman &gt;&gt; that was sitting there &gt;&gt; but the third pull came to heral Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Quit looking at what you're looking at. It's depressing. &gt;&gt; It's preparing people for tribulation. &gt;&gt; We are not preparing to stay in tribulation. We are going into another world. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? It's getting bad. It's getting bad. Did you hear? Leave it alone. &gt;&gt; Live your peaceful life. That's why people get in trouble, religious people, because they get in politics. [Applause] &gt;&gt; They get in politics instead of, in other words, stay in your lane. &gt;&gt; Let the devil in his lane, the devil is in lane, me and my lane. If the devil get in my lane, he trespass. &gt;&gt; He trespass in my lane. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Forget about what is going on. This is the most glorious time God have put you in and God put you there for a reason. In other words, there is no wickedness that can be done in this age that will shake your faith. [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? When you see light, just know around the light &gt;&gt; there's what? &gt;&gt; When you click br.org, or just know which website will come around there. &gt;&gt; The darkness about belief, the sun and everything. They must be around. &gt;&gt; They must be around. If they're not there, the message is not true. &gt;&gt; It is them that vindicate the message. &gt;&gt; Because to know really that you believe God, you must believe him when it's hard. &gt;&gt; Not when everything is good. When everything is not good, that's when you believe it. And that was the bet between Satan and God in the life of Job. &gt;&gt; God want to prove the devil that even if you change the season, &gt;&gt; I will show you Job is different. &gt;&gt; Job doesn't care whether he's healthy or not. &gt;&gt; No matter which state you put job, Job is always sealed. You can put pressure on his children, pressure on his business, pressure on his wife, Job will wake up in the morning and say though he slay me, let her trust him. He said that's the caliber that I'm going to show you. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Stay ragged in your faith. Don't look at the negative. Focus on the positive. Nothing is negative in your life. God bless you. Let's stop here. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Now we have clean up season. We have clean up season in the midst of darkness. In the midst of chaos, in the other side of darkness, now we like to give you instruction. What do you do now in season now? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Never look at a battle. &gt;&gt; Look at what is behind the battle. &gt;&gt; Why am I going through this trial? &gt;&gt; Maybe it's just a time for a better job. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Maybe it's a time your supervisor will know who you are. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; You would teach Elijah how to believe God. He doesn't have your testimony. &gt;&gt; You would teach brother Logos how to believe God. He saw his grade going up. &gt;&gt; You would teach Charles Muhammad how to see God. He saw his grade going up. &gt;&gt; Now when you say the God of Shadrach, Mishakgo, those boys will say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The message is no longer just what they hear, what they live. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we are approaching you humbly this afternoon. Father, thanking you for your grace, for your love, for your mercy, and for everything you have been doing for us. Father, there is no domain that the enemy has worked so hard 6,000 years ago upon the human being like the domain of trial, of darkness, depression, glooiness, dreadfulness, fear, anxiety, tension to confuse your children. But father, the time has come that you want us. No matter what is in front of us, whether it's light or whether it's darkness, it's all the same. In your sight and in our sight, Lord, we know Lord, Father, that we are the light. And where we going, we are shining, Lord. Father, I pray that you help the church from now on to look at everything in a positive way. Every trial in a positive way. any old mistakes that they have done that the devil keep bringing back to their memory to tell them so that they would live a life that I wish I wish I would have done that I wish if I if I didn't make this type of mistake may they understand today that all of it &gt;&gt; was working for a purpose Trying to go to the past, it's a waste of time. It's a depression. But let's look at the positive because in the midst of darkness, there is another side of it. &gt;&gt; There is a light shining somewhere. There is an anointing. There is a favor that has been displayed and dispatched to help your children &gt;&gt; to experience the supernatural like never before. Before we leave this world, &gt;&gt; we are not going to leave this world like people that are barely escaping. &gt;&gt; We are not going to leave this world like people that are rushing out for because they have been chased away by Satan. But we will leave this world as overcomers. &gt;&gt; People that stood the test that fought the good fight and that are going victoriously knowing that they have done what the master asked us to do. Father, may you help each one of us in our work. Lord, may you bless your children and give us travel mercy. And Father, we commit this home on homecoming week unto the hand. Lord, protect us. And Lord, vindicate your word more so that Lord, Father, your children can see your hand more and more in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Take whatever happened in your marriage &gt;&gt; before today, put it in your garbage can. &gt;&gt; All the mistake your husband did, all the mistake your wife did, all the mistake the children have done, put it in the garbage can. &gt;&gt; You are not a fruit of accident. &gt;&gt; You are a fruit of predestination. &gt;&gt; And you have you were chosen to live where you are. to live in the family you are. &gt;&gt; God could not have put you in a better family than where you are. &gt;&gt; So overcome the trial rather. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. We love you. [Applause] Amen. And amen. Um, just a quick announcement. We have cho practice of the service. Amen. [Music] I left a barren land searching for rest. Stumbling round in amnesia, bitterness and distress. But then I met the kinsman redeemer who's called the mighty one. He took this old Moabitete from the field to bring me to his house. [Music] He said, "You're not my child. You are part of me and I'm not your [Music] me. You are a do my eyes you are the woman.
