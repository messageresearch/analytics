[5:44] You don't have to worry.
[5:49] And don't you be afraid.
[5:54] Joy comes in the morning.
[5:59] Troubles they don't last always.
[6:04] For there's a friend in Jesus
[6:09] who will wipe your tears away.
[6:15] And if your heart is broken,
[6:20] &gt;&gt; just lift your hands and say,
[6:24] "Oh, I know that I can make it.
[6:30] I know that I can stand.
[6:35] No matter what may come my way,
[6:40] my life is in your hands.
[6:45] With Jesus, I can take it.
[6:50] With him, I know I can stand.
[6:55] No matter what may come my way,
[7:00] my life is in your hands.
[7:05] So when your test and trials
[7:10] they seem to get you down
[7:15] and all your friends and loved ones
[7:20] are nowhere to be found.
[7:25] Remember there's a friend in Jesus
[7:30] who will wipe your tears away.
[7:35] And if your heart is broken,
[7:40] &gt;&gt; just lift your hands and say, "Oh, I
[7:45] know that I can make it.
[7:50] I know that I can stand.
[7:54] No matter what may come my way,
[7:59] my life is in your hands.
[8:04] With Jesus I can take it.
[8:09] &gt;&gt; With him I know I can stand.
[8:14] No matter what may come my way.
[8:19] My life is in your hands.
[8:24] [Music]
[8:28] God's got it all
[8:30] in control.

[8:38] &gt;&gt; He's got it all
[8:41] in control.

[8:54] way down in my soul, Lord.
[9:00] &gt;&gt; God's got it all
[9:03] in
[9:05] control. Let's sing that again.
[9:09] [Music]
[9:11] God's got it all
[9:13] in control.
[9:15] [Music]
[9:21] &gt;&gt; God's got it all
[9:24] in control.
[9:30] &gt;&gt; He put that reassur
[9:35] way down in my soul, Lord.
[9:39] [Music]
[9:41] God's got it all
[9:44] in control.
[9:46] [Music]
[9:51] &gt;&gt; I put my life
[9:54] in his hand.
[10:01] &gt;&gt; I put my life
[10:04] in
[10:05] his hand.
[10:09] In every road that I walk down,
[10:14] I'm sure it's in his plans.
[10:21] &gt;&gt; So I put my life
[10:23] in God's hands
[10:30] cuz he's got it all
[10:33] in control.
[10:37] [Music]
[10:41] He's got it all
[10:43] in control.
[10:49] He's put that rich
[10:54] way down in my soul.
[10:58] [Music]
[11:00] &gt;&gt; He's got it all
[11:03] in
[11:04] control. Oh,
[11:07] let's go to him this morning. Lord, what
[11:10] a comfort, Lord. Just the thought of
[11:12] that, Lord God,
[11:14] that you've got everything in control,
[11:17] Lord God. And not only here, Lord God,
[11:20] but outside these four walls, everything
[11:22] is going just according to your plan,
[11:24] Lord God.
[11:26] And we thank you Lord for the privilege
[11:28] of living in this time Lord to see
[11:30] everything unfold Lord and to have this
[11:33] word Lord unveiled before our eyes each
[11:36] time we meet Lord God.
[11:38] So Lord God, we just want to just give
[11:40] you thanks, Lord, and put our lives into
[11:43] your hands, Lord, and be assured that we
[11:46] don't we don't have to worry, Lord. Even
[11:48] when we may be brokenhearted, Lord God,
[11:51] you've got it all in control.
[11:54] And we just want to give you all the
[11:55] glory and the honor and the praise for
[11:57] that, Lord. As difficult as it may seem
[12:00] sometime, Lord, and Lord, we don't
[12:04] understand why sometimes, Lord, but if
[12:08] we just trust you, Lord God, we just
[12:10] have to trust you. There's nothing,
[12:12] nobody else like you, Lord. So, who can
[12:15] we turn to? And Lord, who can we put
[12:19] that unwavering trust in besides you,
[12:22] Lord God?
[12:24] So, we're inviting you one more time,
[12:26] Lord God, that you come and meet us in
[12:28] these four walls this morning, Lord, to
[12:30] sit down on the pew, Lord, and to put
[12:33] the spirit in our hearts to worship,
[12:35] Lord God, and to sing the songs of Zion
[12:38] to you, Lord God, and just to lift your
[12:39] name, Lord, and just to give thanks
[12:41] through our singing, Lord, to everything
[12:43] that you do for us each and every day,
[12:46] Lord God, for keeping us, Lord. You keep
[12:48] us each day, Lord. We wake up with the
[12:51] breath of life, Lord, and we take it for
[12:53] granted sometime, Lord God. But we are
[12:55] grateful, Lord Jesus. We have a roof
[12:58] over our head, Lord. We have food in our
[13:01] tummies, Lord, in our refrigerators,
[13:02] Lord. We got gas in our cars, Lord, and
[13:05] even a little money in our bank bank
[13:07] accounts, Lord. And we don't want to
[13:10] take any of that for granted, Lord, and
[13:12] say that we have need and nothing.
[13:13] That's the spirit of the age, Lord. We
[13:15] don't we don't want to be guilty of
[13:18] being under that spirit. Lord,
[13:22] if we have these things, Lord, it's
[13:24] because your grace has provided for us.
[13:29] You've shown some of us, Lord, a lot of
[13:31] mercy and a lot of grace in our lives,
[13:34] Lord,
[13:36] when we weren't even worthy, Lord, to
[13:40] speak your name, Lord.
[13:43] But you've given us that spirit of life,
[13:45] Lord.
[13:47] And you've given us the spirit of truth,
[13:49] Lord. And you've given us this revealed
[13:51] word, Lord God. How could we but worship
[13:55] you and give you singing and give you
[13:58] praise and just thank you, Lord. Just
[14:01] give you thanks for everything, Lord.
[14:06] We're going to ask, Lord, that you touch
[14:07] our musicians one more time this
[14:09] morning, Lord. Our singers, Lord. What a
[14:12] difference, Lord, this little church
[14:14] makes. Lord,
[14:16] bless our technicians, Lord. They had a
[14:19] meeting yesterday, Lord, and we just
[14:21] want to thank you, Lord, for their
[14:23] diligence, Lord, to make sure
[14:24] everything's just right, Lord God.
[14:29] That's what we want, Lord. We want
[14:31] everything to be just right for you,
[14:32] Lord. You're our king, Lord. You're our
[14:35] savior, our redeemer, our We thank you,
[14:39] Lord. We just want to do everything by
[14:41] you right. Lord God,
[14:45] go touch our pastor this morning, Lord
[14:47] God. No doubt you were up with him late
[14:50] through the wee hours of the morning,
[14:52] Lord, preparing this message for us this
[14:55] morning, Lord God. And we just want to
[14:57] make sure that you give him strength,
[14:59] Lord, and bring this thing forth to your
[15:01] people, Lord, as you intended, Lord,
[15:03] without any hindrance from anything
[15:05] coming from any of us, Lord. Let it be
[15:07] gone, Lord. just in the name of Jesus
[15:10] just go out the door cuz only the spirit
[15:13] of God this morning is welcome here.
[15:17] We thank you father and I ask also Lord
[15:21] in the opening prayer Lord that you give
[15:24] us a little relief on this heat Lord God
[15:28] and send us some rain Lord God. We need
[15:30] it naturally as much as we need it
[15:32] spiritually Lord.
[15:35] So have your will Lord above all things
[15:38] in the service, in the weather, in our
[15:41] lives, Lord, in this church.
[15:46] And may you get all glory for everything
[15:48] that's said and done. Lord, preach your
[15:50] word to us this morning, Lord. That's
[15:52] what we came for.
[15:55] We want to bless you, Lord. In Jesus
[15:58] Christ's name, we ask these things, oh
[16:00] God. Amen and amen and amen. Let's give
[16:04] him a clap offering.

[16:09] neighbor. Amen. Amen.
[16:13] Praise God.
[16:17] [Music]
[16:23] [Music]
[16:46] Lord.
[17:01] I would sing in deep in sin, far from
[17:06] the peaceful shore,
[17:10] very deeply stain within, sinking to
[17:16] rise no more.
[17:19] What the master of the sea heard my
[17:25] despairing cry
[17:28] from the waters lifted me. Now say
[17:35] I
[17:37] love
[17:40] me.
[17:42] Love is in me.
[17:46] [Music]
[17:48] Nothing else.
[17:51] Love
[17:53] you.
[17:55] Love is in me.
[18:00] Love is in me.
[18:05] When nothing else could have
[18:10] left me.
[18:14] Now all my heart to him I give it. Ever
[18:19] to him I cling.
[18:23] In his blessed presence lives. Ever his
[18:29] praises sing.
[18:32] Love so mighty and so true merits my
[18:38] soul as song.
[18:41] faithful loving service
[18:45] to him.
[18:48] Love
[18:51] lives in me.
[18:54] Love is in me.
[18:59] When nothing else could
[19:03] love
[19:06] me.
[19:08] Love is me.
[19:12] Love is with me.
[19:17] When nothing else could help
[19:23] me.
[19:26] Souls in danger look above. Jesus
[19:31] completely save.
[19:35] He will lift you by his love out of
[19:40] those angry ways.
[19:44] He's the master of the sea. He knows his
[19:49] will.
[19:53] He our savior wants to be saved to me.
[20:01] Love is in me.
[20:06] Love is in me.
[20:10] When nothing else could help love lives
[20:28] when nothing else could help love
[20:35] me.
[20:37] Redeemed, oh love to proclaim it.
[20:41] Redeemed by the blood of the lamb.
[20:46] Redeemed through his infinite mercy.
[20:50] His child and forever I am
[20:54] redeemed.
[20:57] Redeemed
[21:00] by the blood of the lamb.
[21:03] Redeemed,
[21:05] redeemed,
[21:08] his child. And forever I am
[21:12] redeemed and so happy in Jesus.
[21:16] No language my rapture can tell.
[21:21] I know that the light of his presence
[21:25] with me does that continually dwell.
[21:30] Redeem.
[21:32] Redee,
[21:34] redeemed by the blood of the lamb.
[21:39] Redee,
[21:41] redeemer,
[21:43] child. And forever I am.
[21:47] I think of my blessed redeemer.
[21:52] I think of him all day long.
[21:56] I sing for I cannot be silent.
[22:01] Giver is the theme of my soul.
[22:05] Redee,
[22:07] redeemed,
[22:10] redeemed by the blood of the lamb.
[22:14] Redee,
[22:16] redeemed
[22:18] his child. And forever I am.
[22:23] I know I shall see in his beauty.
[22:27] The King in whose law I delight,
[22:32] who lovingly guarded my footsteps
[22:36] and give me songs in the night.
[22:41] Redee,
[22:43] redee,

[23:50] creation. I'm a new creation.

[25:23] &gt;&gt; We all know her, don't we?
[25:26] &gt;&gt; Amazing grace.
[25:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. I just started thinking about that
[25:35] statement that Jesus made on the cross.
[25:37] It's finished.
[25:38] &gt;&gt; It is finished.
[25:40] &gt;&gt; Our redemption
[25:43] was complete
[25:45] &gt;&gt; at that moment.
[25:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:51] &gt;&gt; It's been in our our decision since
[25:54] then.
[25:55] &gt;&gt; What we going to do with it? Amazing
[26:00] grace,
[26:02] [Music]
[26:04] how sweet the sound.
[26:09] I once was lost,
[26:15] but now I'm found.
[26:20] I was a hopeless
[26:23] place,
[26:25] [Music]
[26:26] &gt;&gt; an empty
[26:28] place
[26:29] [Music]
[26:31] if not for grace. Sing it again. Amazing
[26:36] grace. Amazing grace,
[26:40] [Music]
[26:42] how sweet the sound.
[26:47] I once was lost,
[26:53] but now I'm found.
[26:59] Hopeless
[27:00] [Music]
[27:04] an empty
[27:06] space.
[27:09] If not for grace,
[27:13] then where would I be?
[27:19] God only knows.
[27:23] [Music]
[27:24] I'm so glad you see
[27:29] through those eyes of love.
[27:34] I was a hopeless case
[27:38] [Music]
[27:40] and it seems
[27:42] facing
[27:46] [Music]
[27:51] grace
[27:55] how sweet the sound
[28:00] I once was lost,
[28:05] but now I'm found.
[28:09] I was a hopeless case,
[28:15] an empty
[28:17] space,
[28:20] if not for grace.
[28:25] There's a third verse to this. I don't
[28:27] know if I can sing it well, but I'm
[28:29] going to try. It says, "Precious Lord,
[28:36] please take my hand.
[28:40] [Music]
[28:42] Lead me on.
[28:48] Let me stand."
[28:51] And I was a hopeless
[28:55] case,
[28:57] [Music]
[28:58] an empty
[29:01] face
[29:04] if not for grace.
[29:10] &gt;&gt; Let's give him a clap hour. Clap him
[29:13] this morning. Amen.
[29:16] Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful
[29:19] [Applause]
[29:20] mercy and grace of our dear God. Y'all
[29:23] can be seated for a minute. We're going
[29:25] to have a um a short testimony here in a
[29:27] minute, but I do have a couple other
[29:28] praise reports that I'd like to read.
[29:32] You know, I got up this morning, my
[29:33] stomach wasn't feeling very well. I was
[29:35] complaining all over the house, but you
[29:38] step up here and it's like it's gone.
[29:42] &gt;&gt; More of that grace. Amen.
[29:45] Hallelujah.
[29:49] Actually, we have two short
[29:52] testimonies this morning. So, let me
[29:55] read
[29:56] the the praise report that we have.
[30:02] I haven't read it yet, so I'm not sure I
[30:04] can. This is from Sister Bridette. She
[30:07] says,"I would like to give all thanks,
[30:10] honor, and praise to our Lord for
[30:12] keeping us
[30:16] for keeping us." Is this 31 years? Is
[30:18] that right?
[30:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's Is this an anniversary?
[30:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, wow.
[30:26] Amen.
[30:29] 31 years.
[30:33] Praise God. She said, "Our trials and
[30:35] tri and triumphs."
[30:38] If you've been married for any length of
[30:41] time, you can relate to the trials and
[30:43] the triumphs
[30:45] for our partnership with him because it
[30:48] is a three-way covenant. Amen.
[30:52] &gt;&gt; In our marriage, she said, "He is so
[30:54] faithful."
[30:57] Okay, I'm not I can't
[30:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, I understand that because you
[31:01] capitalize the he. Amen. But you've got
[31:06] Mr. Dailyaly and then something I am
[31:08] looking honey.
[31:13] [Applause]
[31:15] I'm looking forward to crossing into
[31:18] eternity with you. She says, "Amen."
[31:22] Woo.
[31:25] Amen.
[31:27] Brother, that deserves a steak for lunch
[31:30] right there. Texas Roadhouse. Yes. Well,
[31:33] you're going to be there. You can eat
[31:35] one, too. Pick them out of the glass
[31:36] today. Amen. I'm going to ask brother
[31:39] Dam to come up and give a short
[31:42] testimony and then we have brother
[31:44] Daniel as well that has one. And I do
[31:47] ask try to be brief. I've tried to cut
[31:50] my service a little bit so we can give
[31:52] the pastor his time. Amen.
[31:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we want to hear what God did
[31:56] for you and you and brother Daniel.
[31:58] Amen.
[31:59] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[32:00] &gt;&gt; Uh God bless you all.
[32:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:02] Um, it's a short testimony. This
[32:05] happened actually on Wednesday after
[32:08] service because I had to go pick up the
[32:10] minister, the one that was preaching.
[32:13] Um, what's it called? On the way here,
[32:15] we were listening to investment. I had
[32:16] put it on. On the way back, we were
[32:18] listening to like praise songs. And you
[32:22] know how the devil usually like to fight
[32:23] ministers after a good sermon. And this
[32:27] time, he didn't want to give the
[32:28] minister a break. Right after we left
[32:31] around uh what's it called the corner
[32:33] when we were going home there was like a
[32:36] cross intersection or something. We had
[32:39] to ride away and I was going like 10
[32:42] miles per hour to 15 miles per hour and
[32:45] there was a young man in a truck.
[32:49] He took a turn and he was going towards
[32:52] us and he was speeding up and the
[32:54] minister was yelling like Jesus Jesus
[32:55] Jesus and everything was happening all
[32:58] over like I was trying to process
[33:01] everything as I was as I had my foot on
[33:03] the break and as I was calculating I was
[33:06] like it was going to hit us and I didn't
[33:09] want to stay there with the minister
[33:11] after preaching it's going to take a
[33:13] long time so I also started praying in
[33:15] my heart saying Lord God please do
[33:18] something and that that Lord God stopped
[33:20] him and we didn't get hit and we missed
[33:22] the accident.
[33:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[33:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:33] &gt;&gt; Praise God. There's a lot going on
[33:36] nowadays. We have to stay in prayer.
[33:39] Amen. And just keep our guard up. God
[33:40] bless you.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; God bless you all. I wanted to give a a
[33:46] short testimony to glorify our Lord God.
[33:50] Um, a little over a week ago, I share a
[33:53] situation of a rental property that the
[33:58] renters uh were planning evil. Um, the
[34:02] whole time while I was not aware of
[34:04] that. Um but the way everything went uh
[34:09] the hands of God have been protecting me
[34:12] throughout the entire process. Um and u
[34:17] last week we happened to have to go to
[34:20] court again. Um and they show up with so
[34:23] many new claims and the judge looked at
[34:27] everything and denied all of them.
[34:29] Rejected all of them. It only took about
[34:32] 15 minutes and he rejected all of them.
[34:35] He ordered that they be removed from the
[34:38] property within 10 days. Uh knowing
[34:41] everything that they've done with other
[34:43] people in the past. Uh and they
[34:46] themselves saying this is mysterious.
[34:49] They use that word multiple times. We
[34:52] here we know that it is not mysterious.
[34:55] It is it is our Lord God who has been uh
[34:59] protecting us. So I glorify the name of
[35:01] the Lord for everything he does. Amen.
[35:06] Wonderful, my brother. We are so happy.
[35:08] God bless you. Amen.
[35:11] Wonderful. Let's stand this morning
[35:14] &gt;&gt; and go to the Lord. I'm going to ask
[35:15] Brother Charles if he would lead us this
[35:17] morning. I don't have any prayer
[35:19] requests, so I know you got something on
[35:21] your heart.
[35:23] &gt;&gt; Put our hands up. Yes, ma'am.
[35:35] Okay, Sister Lurel says we need to
[35:37] remember Sister Angela is well this
[35:40] morning. She's in the hospital. So,
[35:42] let's remember her and let's remember
[35:44] the captain, her daddy. He's he's still
[35:47] there as well in Charlotte. So, listen,
[35:52] we just learned about that problem with
[35:53] brother Daniel a week ago. It was
[35:55] something that was not we didn't know. I
[35:59] bet you if I come by, if you would be
[36:02] willing to tell me, there's things going
[36:04] on in everybody's life here that you're
[36:07] taking just to God, just you and God.
[36:10] So, let's acknowledge those things this
[36:12] morning as our precious brother goes to
[36:14] the Lord and and let's hold on to him,
[36:17] cling to him. Amen.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; The Lord told us that when the Pope was
[36:23] over here in America and Brother Brandon
[36:25] was here that that great cloud of
[36:27] darkness was over there. So we should be
[36:29] in expectation of these things right now
[36:31] because there's nothing but evil around
[36:32] us. So let's be strong in the Lord.
[36:35] Let's pray together because we can't do
[36:37] this by ourselves.
[36:40] Precious heavenly father, we come before
[36:42] you, Lord God, with needs, heavenly
[36:43] father, that only you can answer, Lord
[36:45] Jesus. And father Lord, we approach you,
[36:48] Lord God, with a heart of understanding,
[36:49] Lord God, that you answer prayer,
[36:51] heavenly father, because you have
[36:53] established us in this present truth,
[36:55] Lord God. You have delivered us, Lord
[36:57] God, the best weapon, Lord God, in
[36:59] prayer, Lord God, and given us a
[37:01] revelation, Lord God, that can shake the
[37:02] foundations of the enemy, heavenly
[37:04] father. Lord God, let us not neglect the
[37:06] weapon of prayer, Lord God. When the
[37:08] pressure comes, Lord God, when the enemy
[37:10] comes in like a flood, the standard,
[37:12] Lord God, you lift. It comes through
[37:14] prayer, Lord God. It comes through a
[37:15] consecrated life, Lord God. Lord, our
[37:17] prayers, Lord God, will anoint your
[37:19] servant to preach directly what we stand
[37:21] in need of, heavenly father. For it is a
[37:23] gift, heavenly father, that you have
[37:24] given unto your bride, Lord Jesus.

[37:43] Bring an anointing in the room, Heavenly
[37:45] Father, and clear the path, Heavenly
[37:47] Father, for you to speak to your
[37:48] children, Heavenly Father. Because it is
[37:50] a promise, Heavenly Father, that
[37:52] whatever comes upon us, Lord God.
[37:53] There's no weapon formed against us that
[37:55] shall prosper, Lord God. These weapons
[37:57] will be formed. These weapons will
[37:58] attack, Heavenly Father, but they shall
[38:00] not prosper, Heavenly Father, for the
[38:02] hand of the Lord is upon his anointed,
[38:04] Father. And those stars that were in the
[38:05] palm of your hand, Heavenly Father, we
[38:07] are represented there, Lord Jesus
[38:09] Christ. And we thank you for it,
[38:10] heavenly father. Lord God, we pray for
[38:12] the tithes and offerings that you use
[38:13] them for the furtherance of your
[38:14] kingdom. Heavenly Father, we pray,

[39:24] your children to bring distractions that
[39:26] they may not hear your word. All the
[39:28] movement that's going on in the church,
[39:29] Lord God. I bind that spirit in the name

[40:37] God bless you saints.
[40:40] I have a little small testimony myself.
[40:42] Um two Fridays ago I um got pulled over
[40:46] by um the police. Um my car was pulling
[40:50] to the left and it looked like I was
[40:53] swerving. So he came to the window and
[40:55] asked if I was um you know if I had
[40:57] anything to think to drink. I said no
[40:58] sir I don't drink. Um I was dropping a
[41:01] friend home to Gastonia and um you know
[41:05] certain things uh to do with the car
[41:07] wasn't in line at that moment and I
[41:09] started to fret but then I said why um
[41:12] in whom shall I fear? What do I have to
[41:13] be afraid of when I have the God
[41:15] Almighty to be there for me? And though
[41:17] I knew the consequences of what could
[41:19] happen, I said, "I'll just wait on the
[41:21] Lord and I'll just be honest with the
[41:22] cop and let him know what's going on."
[41:24] And before I knew it, he came back to
[41:25] the window and I looked up at him and um
[41:29] he said, "Uh, I don't believe in um
[41:31] holding people for no reason, so I'm
[41:33] just going to grant you a warning. You
[41:34] can go ahead and go." And at that
[41:36] moment, I looked at my friend and I
[41:38] said, "You know what we were talking
[41:39] about. You know, this is God, right?"
[41:41] and um and a few other things happened
[41:43] that day, but we it was a very um
[41:46] imperative moment to just see the hand
[41:47] of God um in our lives. I would say
[41:50] since she was there with me, I pray this
[41:52] song will be a blessing to you this
[41:53] morning. Um and sing with me if you know
[41:56] it in Jesus name.

[1:01:20] compensate for the Amen.

[1:02:58] what we're doing. Amen.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Our question and answer,
[1:03:03] the next session will be announced. I'm
[1:03:05] going to wait on brother Glenn to work
[1:03:07] with the facility. The youngsman
[1:03:09] meeting, just a reminder, it's August
[1:03:11] the 9th, which is a part two on the
[1:03:14] courtship. The married couple meeting
[1:03:16] will be September 20th for part seven
[1:03:19] and December the 13th for part 8 and the
[1:03:22] young sister meeting Lot's wedding will
[1:03:24] be September the 27th. I already
[1:03:27] received a lot of question. If you have
[1:03:28] more just keep moving on so we can have
[1:03:31] like a question and answer session and
[1:03:33] move with it. Amen. Amen.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; The building project you can see what's
[1:03:37] going on. This have nothing to do with
[1:03:40] me neither the trustee or whatever. It's
[1:03:43] just God. Amen.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; We plan to start with the fellowship
[1:03:47] hall. We started with the office
[1:03:49] extension and I say okay after the
[1:03:51] office extension we go into the
[1:03:53] fellowship hall and suddenly the man
[1:03:55] call me say hey uh he gave us a quote he
[1:03:59] was like 11,500
[1:04:04] we said we cannot afford that. So for
[1:04:06] some reason we let him alone for some
[1:04:08] time and I received a phone call. I said
[1:04:10] the man is calling me what's going on
[1:04:12] again. So I call him back. He say, "Uh,
[1:04:15] have you done what you were supposed to
[1:04:17] do over there?" I said, "No, your price
[1:04:19] was high."
[1:04:21] Oh, that's your pastor. I'm sorry. Okay.
[1:04:23] I said, "No, your price was high. We
[1:04:25] cannot afford it." He said, "Well, we
[1:04:27] can negotiate because I have nothing to
[1:04:29] do right now." I said, "Praise God.
[1:04:37] I need to teach some of you how to make
[1:04:39] deals."
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And guess what? From 11:50, we
[1:04:45] went down to $850. $3,000 was taken off.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; It is nothing but the grace of God.
[1:04:56] And I said, you know what? I don't even
[1:04:58] have the money to pay you. He said,
[1:04:59] don't worry about it. I already know
[1:05:01] you. Let's go payment the way we do it.
[1:05:03] So the little bit that I get, I'm going
[1:05:05] to go ahead and pay until we get a fix.
[1:05:07] I didn't even give him a penny. He's
[1:05:09] there start working and doing
[1:05:11] everything. So I don't know what to do.
[1:05:13] I thought I'm going to go with the
[1:05:14] fellowship hall. Now it's the front of
[1:05:16] the building. So we ask the the paving
[1:05:18] man to when he can come and work. He
[1:05:22] says he has a job and for some reason he
[1:05:25] cancelled the job and pop up on on
[1:05:27] Thursday himself and start working just
[1:05:29] like that. So I don't know what to tell
[1:05:31] you. I don't know what is next. I'm just
[1:05:34] following the wind.
[1:05:40] Amen.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; I am just working the way the Holy
[1:05:43] Spirit is working. So all it's in God's
[1:05:46] hand. So whatever you see, just keep
[1:05:48] praying and we thank God. Brother Greg,
[1:05:50] Brother Micah, were there painting and
[1:05:53] all day. I mean, I don't know how he
[1:05:56] even did it. And he's here by God's
[1:05:58] grace. So God richly bless you. And I
[1:06:00] look at the camera and brother Robert
[1:06:02] was at uh midnight putting the sun here
[1:06:05] outside. So or whatever you're doing for
[1:06:08] the building, God richly bless you. All
[1:06:10] your contribution or your uh building
[1:06:13] fund, your offering, your tithing,
[1:06:17] whatever, this is what we're doing with
[1:06:18] it. So if you're behind on tithing, make
[1:06:21] sure you catch up so we can do what we
[1:06:23] got to do over there. I I I have to slip
[1:06:26] that one in so we can do what we got to
[1:06:28] do over there and get things moving.
[1:06:30] Amen.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Let's give the Lord a big
[1:06:38] Amen. I heard the song leader already
[1:06:41] mentioning, but keep remembering Sister
[1:06:43] Angela. She she was in a hospital. She's
[1:06:46] in in a hospital, but she's doing
[1:06:48] better. Uh by God's grace, I spoke to
[1:06:50] her this morning. So, keep following up.
[1:06:53] It's a lot. Daddy's sick and everything
[1:06:55] and her being pregnant, all of that
[1:06:57] together. It's not easy to to to handle.
[1:07:00] But God was gracious. Brother Timon uh
[1:07:04] uh wife is at home helping and
[1:07:05] everything. So keep her in prayer. Keep
[1:07:08] that in prayer. By God's grace, we
[1:07:10] believe to a miracle. We believe the
[1:07:12] impossible and God will work up and
[1:07:15] orchestrate everything. And I told her,
[1:07:17] I said, "Sister Angela, whatever you're
[1:07:20] going through, it's for a season.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Whatever the devil is doing for in your
[1:07:25] life, it's for a season."
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; So when we say season, he has a
[1:07:29] beginning
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; and he also has an end. So after a while
[1:07:32] it will be finished and it will be a
[1:07:34] testimony
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; for the glory of God. Amen.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Forgive me if I don't remember your name
[1:07:46] again, but God bless you, Sister
[1:07:48] Bridgen. Sister Zadi's uh cousin
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Andrea.

[1:07:58] God. Brother Glenn, I believe I got
[1:08:01] everything squared away. Brother Robert,
[1:08:03] Brother Tony. So, let's stand for the
[1:08:06] reading of the word.

[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; seizing the season
[1:09:17] of the season.

[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; So flight attendant prepare for takeoff.
[1:09:31] Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[1:09:34] approaching you humbly this morning.
[1:09:36] Father, once again we thank you for your
[1:09:39] grace, your love, your mercy, and for
[1:09:41] everything you have been doing for us.
[1:09:43] The testimonies, the song of Zion.
[1:09:46] Father, giving us an opportunity to see
[1:09:48] your children smiling. looking good
[1:09:50] coming together on this Sunday of people
[1:09:53] with like precious faith that we can
[1:09:55] fellowship, we can laugh, we can share
[1:09:58] our suffering, our burden, we can pray
[1:10:00] together. What a privilege you have
[1:10:02] given unto us, Father. Lord, this is as
[1:10:05] far as I can go with the ability you
[1:10:08] have given me. But Lord, Father, when it
[1:10:10] come to preaching, interpreting,
[1:10:12] speaking, teaching your children, that's
[1:10:14] not a work that a human being can do,
[1:10:16] Lord. It takes the supernatural action
[1:10:19] of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, Father,
[1:10:21] may you move me completely out of the
[1:10:23] way. May you move the audience visible
[1:10:26] and invisible completely out of the way.
[1:10:28] May you be the one speaking, the one
[1:10:30] filling, the one blessing, the one
[1:10:32] touching, the one healing, the one uh
[1:10:34] interpreting and doing everything
[1:10:36] according to the needs of your people.
[1:10:39] Father, be the alpha and the omega of
[1:10:41] this service. May you remove every
[1:10:43] gloomy atmosphere, every depression,
[1:10:46] every spirit of discouragement,
[1:10:49] everything that the devil has been
[1:10:50] beating your people down, Lord. Any
[1:10:53] sorrow atmosphere, Lord, Father, remove
[1:10:56] it completely from this place. May
[1:10:58] nothing but the joy of the Lord be our
[1:11:00] strength and be present this morning.
[1:11:03] May you start with us all the way to the
[1:11:05] end, Lord, Father, as we commit it all
[1:11:07] unto the hand in the name of Jesus
[1:11:10] Christ. Amen.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:12:41] you after church. How many seen an ant
[1:12:43] here?
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Okay, you might be seated. So, God is
[1:12:47] sending us to an end.

[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; and look how small an ant is
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; and God is sending all of us go to the
[1:13:01] ant. Go to the little little little tiny

[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Ah so we all going to the end.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Yes. So you need to stoop down.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; You need to humble yourself
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; to look at the ant.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; You have to come really really low
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; and to look at it.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; You have to even talk soft because your
[1:13:33] breath can even shake the ant.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; So the ant is afraid. What's going on?
[1:13:42] What have I done to your house?
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; You say God bless you ant.

[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; You who don't want to do anything.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on, brother.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Go to the end.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; What is a lazy man or a lazy woman going
[1:14:26] to learn from an ant? Come on.
[1:14:30] He say go to the end, you slagger.
[1:14:34] Consider its ways. I want you to learn.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; You human being with a soul.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Go learn from an ant who doesn't have a
[1:14:46] soul.
[1:14:49] So God is bringing you to the first
[1:14:51] Bible.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said the first
[1:14:56] Bible is nature.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; So God is bringing you to the first
[1:15:01] Bible.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; He said go consider. In other words,
[1:15:05] observe
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; the end.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Stop your busy schedule.

[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn your TV off.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Turn your cell phone off.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Go see the end.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Watch. Observe.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; Consider
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; the end.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; The Bible say, "Consider its way and be
[1:15:34] wise."
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; In other word, there is a wisdom that is
[1:15:41] connected to an end. Amen.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; And the only way you can catch that
[1:15:49] wisdom, you need to go and watch,
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; And observe and learn from the ant.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; In other words, go to the ant house to
[1:16:00] acquire wisdom.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; You never thought about an ant being
[1:16:06] wise.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; From today, you are learning that an ant
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; has wisdom. Don't worry, I'm going to
[1:16:13] read scripture. Amen.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Consider its way and be
[1:16:18] wise."
[1:16:20] What is the ways of an ant? What is in
[1:16:23] this ant that the Lord want us to learn?
[1:16:28] What is going on with the ant? Amen.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Number one,
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; the ant verse seven,
[1:16:38] which having no guide
[1:16:42] Amen.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; They ain't have no leader.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; They don't have anybody to ask for
[1:16:52] direction.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; You do.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Not the answer.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; No guide. No GPS.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Okay. So if there is no guide, this is a
[1:17:09] disaster here.
[1:17:12] How am I going to learn from a people
[1:17:13] that don't even have a leader?
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; The Bible say no guide,
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; no what?
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Overseer.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; You know what it means, right?
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; No manager.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; No supervisor. Amen.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; In other word, the ant doesn't need
[1:17:36] somebody to urge him.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; There it is.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; To do something.
[1:17:42] [Music]
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; The ant has no one to control
[1:17:52] or to come after
[1:17:55] to verify
[1:17:58] his labor.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Right. Amen.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Because we do things right
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; for paycheck.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; There it is. There it is right there.
[1:18:06] Amen.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; If not, you're going to be fired.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; There it is.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; The supervisor say you have to do this
[1:18:14] up to 10. You're doing up to 10 and
[1:18:17] you're doing correctly because you under
[1:18:20] supervision.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; You under surveillance.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; There are camera in the building.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; That's why you go to the bathroom to
[1:18:28] text.
[1:18:31] Don't say amen, my friend. That's why
[1:18:33] you go to the bathroom to talk slowly
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; because somebody is watching you.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; There ain't no one is there to watch
[1:18:41] whether you on the phone or not.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; If you on the phone all day, that's your
[1:18:46] problem.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; If you on the internet all day, that's
[1:18:48] your problem.
[1:18:50] But the scripture, no guide, nobody to
[1:18:54] control them,
[1:18:56] no daddy to yell at them.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; No parent to whoop them.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; The liberty we're looking for, they
[1:19:11] ain't he have it.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; I don't want nobody to tell me nothing,
[1:19:16] anything.
[1:19:18] I want to live my life.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; I'm already grown up.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; You cannot tell me this and this and
[1:19:24] this. Hey, come on. I'm 18. I'm 21.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; The ant has it.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; In other words, do whatever you want to
[1:19:33] do.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; No guide.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; No supervisor.
[1:19:38] Ah, so the Lord want me to learn
[1:19:41] independence.
[1:19:44] Praise the Lord. Finally, I'm free
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; because I'm tired of daddy telling me
[1:19:49] what to do.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; I'm tired of mama telling me what to do.
[1:19:55] I'm tired of the pastor being on me all
[1:19:58] the time.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; I'm tired of the deacon checking on me.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; Go watch the enter.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; They don't have no deacon.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; That's it. That's it. That's it. That's
[1:20:14] it. Amen.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; They don't have no pastor.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; They have no trustees.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; No organization.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Can I continue?
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; The Bible say no guide
[1:20:31] or what?
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Overseer.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; Kama or what?
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Ruler.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; So who's the police officer there?
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Who puts people to jail?
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; No one.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Yes. So according to us,
[1:20:46] we will anticipate a careless society.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; A society without structure.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; But we with our structure, we flunk,
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; The ant doesn't have it.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; And God say, "Go over there. Go watch
[1:21:05] people that are working with the
[1:21:08] supervision of the Holy Ghost."
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:21:12] That's it.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; The people that are guided from the
[1:21:15] Garden of Eden.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; They're not guided by human
[1:21:20] organization.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; They don't need a chief.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Because Israel was not supposed to have
[1:21:26] a king right there.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Or a ruler.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; The Lord himself was the ruler of
[1:21:32] Israel.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; But Israel wanted to be like other
[1:21:36] nation.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Number one, no supervision, nothing.
[1:21:45] Comma. Verse eight,
[1:21:48] the ant
[1:21:50] provide her meat when
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; in the summer.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Who taught this guy
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; to learn about summer? So the ant know
[1:22:00] season.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. The ant has no supervisor, no
[1:22:09] guide, nothing but ant understand
[1:22:15] season.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Understanding
[1:22:24] understanding
[1:22:26] of season.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; And the season here is summer.
[1:22:34] And during the summer, the Bible say,
[1:22:37] what does the ant do?
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Gather her meat.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; He provides the meat.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; It is providing.
[1:22:46] You can even call gathering.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; So summer
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; for the ant means what?
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Providing.
[1:23:00] In another translation it say the ant
[1:23:03] prepare.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; So summer for the end is what?
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Preparation.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Summer for human being is what?
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; A preparation.

[1:23:47] of control.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; They are looking for pleasure
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; because summer has come to God. If you
[1:23:56] go to the world is a mess, put a shirt
[1:23:58] on and go outside, lay on the sun, get a
[1:24:01] sun, all kind of stuff.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; But for the end,
[1:24:07] [Applause]

[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; when we are on a roller coaster,
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; woohoo. Yeah.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; When we are doing selfies.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Somebody is working.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Based on the season.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Now, why is the ant working on summer?

[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; When it's summer, what does it mean to
[1:25:41] us? Summer means what? There is
[1:25:43] something really quick that come means
[1:25:46] what?
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; And when it come to the weather s means
[1:25:51] what?
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; So if heart is there what is coming
[1:25:57] next?
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; The Bible says if you remember this in
[1:26:06] Genesis 8 uh 8:22 the Bible says while

[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; and night
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; shall water
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; not cease.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Let's go slowly because I have to go
[1:26:25] this way.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Number one, they say seed time
[1:26:32] and the opposite is what?
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Harvest.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; And the next is what?
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Cold.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Cold.

[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. And what follow? Day
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; and night.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Who established this?
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; It is God program.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; So if I'm in the seed time, what is
[1:27:04] coming?
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; The harvest.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; If I'm in harvest, what is coming?
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Uhuh. Leave. I'm I'm on the first line.
[1:27:12] If I'm in harvest, what happen?
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Let me make it easy on you.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; If it's day, what is coming up?
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Night.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; And if it's night, what is coming up?
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Day.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Is it difficult?
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; So if it's summer, what is coming up?
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Winter.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; If it's winter, what is coming up?
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; Summer.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; So the So when the ant is on the summer,
[1:27:34] the ant doesn't work as in doesn't leave
[1:27:37] summer.
[1:27:42] The ant is working everything
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; according to winter.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; In other words, the ant is a season
[1:27:54] ahead.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; We all know it's night. I mean, it's day
[1:28:04] right now. And we know exactly that
[1:28:07] everything you have to do, you need to
[1:28:10] do it according to a time
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; because sooner McDonald will close.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Sooner the restaurant will close.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Sooner Zach will close.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Sooner Walmart will close. So you got to
[1:28:24] work according to the time.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; If you miss the time,
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; night is coming. Correct.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; And everything you were supposed to do,
[1:28:33] you got to wait
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; till next season.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; We clear now.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; So if we see summer, we know winter is
[1:28:43] coming. That's right.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; If it's cold, we know that. Don't worry,
[1:28:46] sooner. What is coming up?
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; The heat.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; And if it's a period of sickness, what
[1:28:50] is coming next?
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Period of hell.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; If it's a period that you struggling
[1:28:56] financially, what is coming next?
[1:28:59] financial blessing.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Don't worry about it. If it's a period

[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; So, if you begin to understand that you
[1:29:16] don't have to worry,
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; do you pray for the night to happen?
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; What do you do? You just mind your
[1:29:26] business.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; That's right. And before you know it,
[1:29:28] night will happen. That's right.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Whether you pray or not, night will
[1:29:31] happen because it's a covenant of God.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Amen.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; God is behind it.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; You are not the one controlling nature.
[1:29:41] God is in nature.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; The Bible says we are on ver I'm still
[1:29:49] reading the Bible, the the scripture.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; We are on verse eight. The ant does
[1:29:54] what? It provideth what? her meat in the
[1:29:56] summer.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Her meat when
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; in the summer
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; in the summer. Come on. And gather her
[1:30:02] what?
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Her food
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; when
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; in the harvest.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; You seen summer and harvest there.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; So when it's summer for the for the end,
[1:30:12] it means what?
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Preparation.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; And then when it's harvest,
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; what does he mean?
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; See what does the ant do?
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; Gathering. gatherth what
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; her food.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; So the gathering are happening
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; in the summer and in the harvest.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham say the Bible is a eastern
[1:30:42] book
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; and we are western people. And brother
[1:30:48] Brandham said the biggest trouble we
[1:30:50] got, one of the trouble we got, we are
[1:30:52] trying to understand an eastern book
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; with a western perspective.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; That's why we don't understand certain
[1:31:01] things in the Bible.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; When you say this is summer, this is
[1:31:04] harvest. What does harvest mean?
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Got the food.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Let's understand. Let's take what
[1:31:15] happened in Israel. Let's put it to the
[1:31:19] western
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; terminology so we understand what we
[1:31:23] reading.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Because according to you when we say
[1:31:27] summer, the next thing we should have
[1:31:29] say is winter.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; But God doesn't put winter.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; God is saying summer and harvest.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; So is harvest on winter or where is
[1:31:40] harvest to us?
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying?
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; So let's understand this. Let's refocus
[1:31:47] our our binocular here so we understand
[1:31:50] this. I'm trying to help you my friend.
[1:31:53] The Bible says in Matthew 24:32,
[1:31:58] Jesus say, "Now do what?
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; Learn a parable."
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; The parable of what?
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; The fig tree.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Remember the name is a fig tree. I came
[1:32:05] this morning and the scripture of
[1:32:06] brother Brandham was playing about the
[1:32:08] fig tree. I said, "My God, what a
[1:32:10] confirmation.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; The fig tree."
[1:32:14] And somebody gave my wife today a fig.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; I say double confirmation.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; So you didn't know that what was in the
[1:32:22] scripture.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; To you it's somebody giving my wife to
[1:32:27] me means something.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; It mean I'm in the right path.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; The Bible say now learn the parable of
[1:32:33] what?
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; The fig tree.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; In other words, the fig tree got a
[1:32:37] message.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; When its branch is yet what?
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Tender. and does what?
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Puteth forth leaves.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; You know that summer is water.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; The Bible didn't say that summer have
[1:32:50] come.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; In other words, we are only approaching
[1:32:54] water.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; We clear? I'm trying to refocus
[1:32:58] everything.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; According to our western world,
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; you have winter
[1:33:06] and then what follow?
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Spring.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Spring.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; And then what follow?
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Summer.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Summer. And then what follow?
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Fall.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together now?
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Now summer, we already know what summer
[1:33:21] is.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; There is no problem for us. We're trying
[1:33:24] to find what harvest mean.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Is harvest winter, spring, fall or what?
[1:33:29] What? What is going on?
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; That's what we're trying to refocus.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Now the Bible is saying here that when
[1:33:36] the branches of the fig tree do what?
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Bring forth. In other words, when the
[1:33:41] branch begin to come out
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; and then when he put forth what?
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; Leaves.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; In other word, God is saying that this
[1:33:49] fig tree
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; just went through a season where there
[1:33:54] was no more leaf.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; Ah, please help me.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm I'm in a surgery to help you.
[1:34:02] There is no more leaf
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; and there is no more branches. to us the
[1:34:08] season that you see no leaves
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; on the trees
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; and no branches, it is which season?
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; Are we clear now?
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Are we Are we clear now?
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; So now we understand winter according to
[1:34:21] the Bible.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Correct. Amen.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; We clear now.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; There is no leaf.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; No branches. Everything is dry. Amen.
[1:34:32] Now Jesus is saying learn the parable of
[1:34:36] the fig tree. When you see branches
[1:34:38] begin to come
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; and then leaf begin to come up on the
[1:34:43] trees. According to us here in the
[1:34:46] United States
[1:34:48] in winter, there is nothing on the
[1:34:51] trees. But there is a season that leaf
[1:34:55] begin to come
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; and allergy begin to pop up
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; and things begin to bad.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; What do we call it here?
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Spring.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; So what was Jesus talking about?
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; Spring.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; To us Jesus is talking about what?
[1:35:14] spring
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; and spring is before what?
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; Summer.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus say when you see spring
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; just know that what
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; summer is now.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Have I lost somebody?
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; In other words, Jesus when he's seeing
[1:35:30] spring, what is he looking at?
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; When you talking about spring,
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Jesus doesn't is not really careful
[1:35:40] about spring. Jesus begin to look at
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; summer.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; And when Jesus is in summer, what is
[1:35:46] Jesus looking at?
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; Now, are we together?
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Now, are we together?
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; The true word for fall is called autumn.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Then on the summer, this is when the
[1:36:07] first harvest start.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. Follow me my friend.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; And it's usually the harvest of fruit.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; That's why when you read your Bible, you
[1:36:18] will see the Bible says summer fruit,
[1:36:20] summer fruit all over the scripture.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. The first harvest of the first
[1:36:26] fruit started in the summer.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; You will understand why Jesus went.
[1:36:34] Okay, let me leave it alone. Okay. Okay.
[1:36:36] Okay. When the summer start, this is
[1:36:39] where the first harvest is starting.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Then the true harvest.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Where it's about the crop and everything
[1:36:49] else. That one happened in the fall.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; This is where your harvest is.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; We understand now. Now, let's go back to
[1:37:04] our scripture. So the ant
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; work in summer and in the
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; harvest.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; Which is which month? Which season?
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Fall.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; What? Fall or fall?
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; Winter.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; So summer and fall is a preparation for
[1:37:25] what?
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Winter.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together? And God said go over
[1:37:34] there to the uh ant and go learn. What
[1:37:37] are we learning? There is no supervisor.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; There is no ruler.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; There is no parent.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; There is no mentor.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; But these creature are depending on the
[1:37:51] season.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; And they usually work by looking at the
[1:37:55] season ahead of them.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; My subject this morning is taking
[1:37:59] advantage of what?
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; The season. So if you are looking for
[1:38:03] winter, what do you do on the fall and
[1:38:06] the spring?
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; Prepare.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; The Bible says this, my friend. Glory to
[1:38:17] God. In the book of Jeremiah 8:20, the
[1:38:21] Bible say that the water
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; the harvest is passed.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; Which season are we at?
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; Fall.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Fall. And the summer is what?
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; It's ended.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; And we are not water. save.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Why is the Bible keeping put I mean put
[1:38:33] summer and harvest. Summer and harvest.
[1:38:36] And the Bible is saying here that summer
[1:38:39] have gone.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; The harvest has gone
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; and we are not what?
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; The correct translation means we are not
[1:38:47] delivered.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Because Israel was depending
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; on the summer
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; and the harvest to to gather
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; the food provided by God.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; When you tell a Jews it's summer, it
[1:39:09] means something else.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; When you tell us it's summer, we go to
[1:39:13] the beach.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; I hope you are understanding me.
[1:39:18] Young people,
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; summer doesn't mean beach
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; because if you miss the summer,
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; if you miss the time,
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; you going to stop down the road.
[1:39:33] [Applause]
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; Help me preach my friend.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; These are tough message believer. We
[1:39:43] don't talk about it.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; But in this church, we talk about
[1:39:46] everything.
[1:39:47] We cannot live like people who don't
[1:39:50] know what we are doing.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. The rapture have not happened yet.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; You need to know how to live.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; And God has a program
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; that is orchestrating everything in this
[1:40:03] world.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; And if you learn the program of God, you
[1:40:08] won't have an accident.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; You will be riding on after the program.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together. Amen.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; Take your time.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; In other words, God have a roller
[1:40:23] coaster. He already placed.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; All you have to do, jump on it.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; And when you jump on a roller coaster,
[1:40:29] you just sit quiet. It will take you
[1:40:31] where it's supposed to go.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; That's what God is telling you. Learn
[1:40:35] from the ant.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; The ant learn about the program.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; The ant just got on the elevator and sat
[1:40:42] quiet. And the elevator is picking them
[1:40:44] up.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:46] We human being are going through the
[1:40:48] stairs.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; There are stairs and there is an
[1:40:55] elevator.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Elevator. You don't do no work.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; Somebody else is doing the work.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; In the stairs, you will be doing work.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; By the time you get to the fourth level,
[1:41:06] you tired.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; But the one in the elevator can't be
[1:41:10] even drinking coffee.
[1:41:12] And the elevator is taking me up. Learn
[1:41:15] God's elevator.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; You want to go to the rapture, learn God
[1:41:27] elevator for the rapture.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; Release the break. God will take you to
[1:41:39] the rapture.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; Because the message is built for the
[1:41:43] rapture.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; Amen, Lord.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; We on verse uh 8. Jump to verse 9, my
[1:41:56] friend. I'm reading the Bible.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Let's go. How long will you what?
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; Sleep.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; The devil is troubling you not to get
[1:42:07] this.
[1:42:08] So let's stay focused.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; How long will you sleep?
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Oh lazy
[1:42:17] slagger.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; When will you rise up out of your sleep?
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; In other words, God is telling somebody,
[1:42:23] "Wake up."
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; You've been playing too much.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; You lost a ladder season in your life.
[1:42:30] I'm going to get in your life and I'm
[1:42:33] going to show you how your life is
[1:42:34] revolving.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God say wake up.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; Watch the ant.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; There is a secret in nature. There is a
[1:42:42] secret in the ant.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; Learn that.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; Verse uh 10. Yet a what?
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; A little sleep.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; And a what?
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; A little slumber.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Did you see God saying a big sleep?
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Did you see God saying a big sleep?
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; God say a what?
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; A little sleep.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; And a little what?
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Slumber. So what causes your trouble is
[1:43:08] not too big.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; A little le
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; up the whole lamp.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; A little tiny habit
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; can destroy your entire life.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Not the big habit, not the little bit of
[1:43:26] habit.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; And the Bible say just a little sleep
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; and a little what?
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Slumber. In other words, God is telling
[1:43:33] you the little bit the stuff that you
[1:43:35] think there.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; Correct?
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; Because when the disciple came to God,
[1:43:39] they say increase our faith,
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; And they were expecting God to say,
[1:43:44] "Okay, I'm going to give you a big
[1:43:46] faith." God said, "No, if you have a
[1:43:49] faith like a what?
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; Master seed.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; A little mustard seed. If you can speak
[1:43:53] to that mountain,
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; it's usually the little stuff
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; that can bring the big stuff down.
[1:44:00] It's usually the little ant
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; that can give you wisdom.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; The Bible say a little sleep come and a
[1:44:13] what?
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; A little slumber.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Come on. And a what?
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; A little folding of the hands.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; A little what?
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; Folding of the hands.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; Not a ladder. Folding of hand.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; A little what?
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Folding of the hands.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; A little doing nothing.
[1:44:28] is
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; a lud taking off a break
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; can cause you trouble in life.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; No, I'm just taking it easy now.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; They usually tell
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; I don't have a scripture for it in my
[1:44:50] language. Don't give the dog raw meat.
[1:44:55] Especially when you have h a farmer.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; Right. Correct, brother. That's right.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; Always give the dog cook meat.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; Because the dog will learn to eat cook
[1:45:05] meat.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; But if you give the dog raw meat,
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; the dog begin to taste the blood.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; Now the dog begin to look at all the
[1:45:15] goat.
[1:45:19] all the pigs that are in the farm
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; as a
[1:45:24] as a prey to eat
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; because the goat now now the dog doesn't
[1:45:29] wait doesn't have to wait for cook food.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; The dog understand that hey if I can
[1:45:34] attack the goat right there so the dog

[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; Do what God say.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; The 12 came do like your brother.
[2:01:44] Exactly right.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; You want to be rich, what do you do?
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; Be diligent.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; Be diligent.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; Be diligent.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; The Bible say and but the hand of the
[2:02:01] water.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; Diligent.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; So the slack have hand.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; The diligent have hand.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; But the problem is what are the hand
[2:02:09] doing?
[2:02:11] Yeah,
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; it whatever your hand is doing your work
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; because hand represented work. Whatever
[2:02:18] your work are doing, you are either
[2:02:20] attracting a blessing or you are
[2:02:22] attracting a demon.
[2:02:25] [Applause]
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; because I mean we we we have to in this
[2:02:33] message it become normal two income.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; It looks like we can't live without two
[2:02:40] income.
[2:02:41] But with two anchor, we still
[2:02:43] struggling.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; And before you know it, our children
[2:02:47] bring also anchor.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; Now we have a third anchor
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; and we have a fourth anchor. But we
[2:02:53] still struggling. Something is wrong.
[2:03:11] That's fine, my friend. I got to follow
[2:03:13] the spirit.
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; Verse five.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; He that gatherth when?
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; In summer.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; Now it's not the ant.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; Remember the ant gatherth in which?
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; Summer. And what?
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; And harvest.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; Look at verse five. He that gatherth
[2:03:28] when?
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; In summer.

[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; Ah like remember the ant also work in
[2:03:44] the summer.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; So you got to follow the ant.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; Your GPS is the ant.
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; Who that gatherth in summer is a what?
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; Wise son.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; But he that sleepeth where
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; in harvest.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; Do you see the same thing? The ant
[2:03:58] summer
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; and harvest. human being summer and
[2:04:03] water.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; Harvest.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; He say he that gatherth in the summer is
[2:04:11] a what?
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; A wise son.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; And but he that sleepeth
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; when
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; in harvest
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; when everybody's working, he's sleeping.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; He that sleepeth in the harvest. In
[2:04:26] harvest is a son that causes what?
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; Shame. So again, summer and harvest,
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; summer and harvest,
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; wisdom is connected to your behavior
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; in summer and harvest.

[2:04:58] declaring by spring.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; I don't know if we're together.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus say if you see, you
[2:05:04] know already that if you see the tree is
[2:05:06] baded,
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; you know summer is coming. In other
[2:05:09] words, abundance is coming.

[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; Even your brain has a season.
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; I don't know why I'm saying all of this,

[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; And there is a season no learning will
[2:08:52] get in your brain. You will suffer to
[2:08:54] memorize one page.
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; But there is a season you can memorize a
[2:08:59] book.
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; Be careful young people.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; When your brain can memorize,
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; use the system.
[2:09:09] [Applause]
[2:09:16] There will come a season your brand can

[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; I send text messages and giving you
[2:09:39] quote. Some of you in less than five
[2:09:42] second you already responded.
[2:09:45] Sharp brain
[2:09:47] I already read it. There will come a
[2:09:49] time when you read you have to read
[2:09:50] three times.
[2:09:55] [Music]
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; That's when we realize we need to go
[2:09:59] back to school
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; and now we struggling
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; because you miss your time.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; You will understand me my friend.
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:10:10] Are we together?
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; Proverb 30:4. If you dare, you can say
[2:10:14] amen.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; We must be delivered from these things.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; Proverb 20 uh 30:4. The Bible say there
[2:10:22] be how many things?
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; Four things
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; which are how?
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; Little upon the earth.
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; So God is telling you those things among
[2:10:28] the earth, they are how many?
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; What the size of it?
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; Little.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; They are very little. In other words,
[2:10:34] you will you will you will underestimate
[2:10:37] those things.
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; Because of their size.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham told us it's not
[2:10:42] the size
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; that's correct
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; of the dog in the fight.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; It is the size of the fight inside the
[2:10:48] dog.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; But the Bible say there are four things
[2:10:52] which are little upon the earth. Come
[2:10:54] on. But they are what?
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; Exceeding wise.
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; They are not wise.
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; They are very wise. Amen.
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; But those things are how
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; we need to know one of them. That's what
[2:11:08] I'm interested for today.
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; Verse 25. The ants.
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; Ah. So the ant are not wise.
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; They are exceedingly wise.
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; The ants are a people what? Not strong.
[2:11:29] I need to work four job.
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; It's not this.
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; You can wear out yourself.
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; The ant don't have this.
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; But they are exceedingly. In other
[2:11:42] words, the ant are operating by wisdom.
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; They make wisdom worksh
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; more than the muscle.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. There are four things that are
[2:11:56] exceedingly wise. The ant are a people
[2:11:59] what?
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; Not strong.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; Come on. Yet they do what?
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; Prepare their meat in the summer when
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; in the summer.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; So this preparation of a meat in the
[2:12:08] summer, God is utilizing this to give
[2:12:12] the ant more wisdom.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the ant understand
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; foresee the season. Amen.
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; The ant have a discernment
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; sir
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; of the season
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; and what to do in the season
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; and based on that discernment they are
[2:12:32] reflecting wisdom.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; Why all of this?
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; John chapter 5 and we take off.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; Let's go to John chapter 5.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; Oh my God. He's just reading the Bible.
[2:12:52] [Laughter]
[2:12:55] If you there you can say amen.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; John 5 verse2 we're talking about taking
[2:13:00] advantage.
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; So all of you here already understood
[2:13:04] the ant.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; Brother say even in the kingdom of the
[2:13:08] ant. If you don't work you don't eat. I
[2:13:11] have the code.
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; That's what brother say.
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; So the ant are discipline.
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; If you were playing on the internet no
[2:13:18] problem. I won't loan you money.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; Don't say amen. Let's go to John chapter
[2:13:26] 5, my friend.
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; If you there, you can say amen.
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; Verse two. Now there is at Jerusalem by
[2:13:33] the sheep market a water
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; a pool.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; Remember this is not a river.
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; This is not a river.
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; A river flows.
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; This is not an ocean. This is a pool. A
[2:13:49] pool. The water in a pool stay
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; stagnant. Calm.
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; The scripture knows why he says a pool.
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; Because if it's a river, there is
[2:13:59] something else.
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; Because the river have current.
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; It goes one way.
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; Okay. The Bible says there was a pool
[2:14:10] kama which is called in the Hebrew
[2:14:11] tongue water
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; Bethesda.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; Having how many porches?
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; Five porches. Praise God. Grace. Verse
[2:14:18] three. Let's leave those uh stuff. Let's
[2:14:20] get to what we trying to get. Indeed lay
[2:14:23] a great multitude.
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say thousands.
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; Of what?
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; Impulence folk
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; and what
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; of blind
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; and who?
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; Of halt.
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; And who?
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; Withered.
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; And who?
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; Waiting for the movement of the water.
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; So everybody that was there got problem.
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:42] If you are laying in the porches of
[2:14:44] Bethesda,
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; you got a problem.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; To make it plain, you got a sickness.
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; You got a illness in your body.
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; That's why you are there.
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; Let's put it there maybe in another way.
[2:14:59] There was a hospital called Beesta.
[2:15:02] [Music]
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; And he had five campuses. the man uh CMC
[2:15:10] and the Huntersville and the one and
[2:15:12] five of them and in them lay a lot of
[2:15:15] people
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; that are sick.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; All of them were waiting. They were
[2:15:19] waiting for what?
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; The moving of the water
[2:15:21] &gt;&gt; and the moving of the water. So the
[2:15:24] water was moving. We know that the water
[2:15:26] of the pool doesn't move. Yes,
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; but something was happening to this pool
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; that the water was moving
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; and brother Brandham say normally I have
[2:15:37] the code if it's a river are we together
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; water run into a certain direction and
[2:15:45] the wind sometime will come in the
[2:15:47] opposite direction and brother Brandham
[2:15:50] say when the current and the wind are
[2:15:52] opposite it create what they call a
[2:15:55] trouble water
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; but this is not a river.
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; So when we got trouble water in a pool,
[2:16:02] they knew that there must be something
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; that is troubling the water.
[2:16:07] &gt;&gt; In other words, this is not a natural
[2:16:10] occurrence.
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; This is something supernaturally that is
[2:16:14] chopping the water up.
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:16:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:19] &gt;&gt; Verse four. For what? An angel
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; went down when
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; at a certain season.
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; Any question?
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; The angel come when?
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; At a certain season.
[2:16:31] &gt;&gt; So the angel doesn't come any time.
[2:16:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; The angel come at a certain
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; season.
[2:16:37] &gt;&gt; At a certain season into what?
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; The pool.
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; And do what?
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; And troubled the water.
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; Chop the water. He stir the water.
[2:16:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. What? Whosoever then what? First,
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; after the troubling of the world, the do
[2:16:50] what?
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; Stepped in,
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; was made how
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; whole
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; of what?
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; Whatsoever disease he had.
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; So
[2:17:00] this angel was bringing healing.
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; The angel will come and hit the water.
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; And when the water is trouble,
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; the water now receive virtue
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; of a healing. But we know that, oh
[2:17:16] Israel, I am the Lord
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; that heals you
[2:17:21] &gt;&gt; from all your disease.
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; So this angel must be not just an angel.
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; But it must be who?
[2:17:33] &gt;&gt; The angel of the Lord.
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; When he hit me, I say, "Wait a minute.
[2:17:38] Let me verify with brother Brandham."
[2:17:40] When I verify, I found only one coat.
[2:17:43] Brother Brandham say it was the angel of
[2:17:46] the Lord. I say praise the Lord. Now my
[2:17:48] inspiration is lining up with the
[2:17:50] messenger. Now I can tell you that.
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; So it was the angel of the Lord. God
[2:17:55] himself was coming down and trouble the
[2:17:58] water. Are we together?
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; The problem was who would jump first.
[2:18:06] &gt;&gt; What an expectation.
[2:18:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said they were even
[2:18:10] fighting with knives.
[2:18:14] because he only come in the season.
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; So if you are distracted
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; if you are constantly going to Walmart
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; when the angel come, you won't be there.
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; So you must be constantly watching.
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; for the moving of the water?
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; Because your deliverance is there.
[2:18:42] Amen.
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; What type of deliverance? The Bible says
[2:18:49] in verse four, for the troubling, the
[2:18:51] Bible say, for an angel went down at a
[2:18:54] certain season into the pool and trouble
[2:18:56] the water, whosoever then first after
[2:18:59] the troubling of the water. Brother
[2:19:01] Brandham say by faith stepping was made
[2:19:04] what?
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; Of what?
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; Whatsoever disease he had. In other
[2:19:08] word, the w the disease was not the
[2:19:11] problem.
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; The the water didn't make a distinction
[2:19:20] &gt;&gt; on your problem.
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; If it's high blood pressure,
[2:19:24] &gt;&gt; if it's diabetes,
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; if it's kidney, if it's skin problem, if
[2:19:29] it's a headache, if it's a female
[2:19:31] trouble, that doesn't count there. Amen.
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; The water will touch whichever disease.
[2:19:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:38] &gt;&gt; I am the Lord your God who heals you
[2:19:40] from water.
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; So the disease is not the problem. The
[2:19:45] problem was the opportunity.
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. That's
[2:19:49] right.
[2:19:50] &gt;&gt; The season
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; was more important.
[2:19:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; In other words, the the the Bible say
[2:19:57] the angel come in a certain what?
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; So the angel bring the season.
[2:20:04] Hallelujah.
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; I hope you did it.
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham say we didn't we don't
[2:20:14] know whether it would take weeks or
[2:20:17] months or years we don't know but the
[2:20:20] season lays with the angel. So when the
[2:20:23] angel come down,
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; the season has come.
[2:20:31] &gt;&gt; And when the season was was come,
[2:20:34] &gt;&gt; whatsoever your problem is
[2:20:38] sir.
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; You need to seize the season. You need
[2:20:42] to jump in the season.
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; You need to step in the season. Amen.
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; you need to step in the anointing.
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir.
[2:20:59] &gt;&gt; Do you know that water represent a
[2:21:00] multitude of the people?
[2:21:03] &gt;&gt; You know that, right?
[2:21:05] &gt;&gt; You know that, right?
[2:21:06] &gt;&gt; So, when you see the multitude of the
[2:21:08] people begin to get stirred,
[2:21:11] &gt;&gt; who have come down?
[2:21:15] When you are in church and then you see
[2:21:17] people rising up and say, "Praise the
[2:21:20] Lord." Oh, glory to God. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:21:24] Who has come down?
[2:21:26] [Applause]
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; I hope we together.
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; I hope we together. Instead of watching
[2:21:36] your neighbor like this, instead of
[2:21:38] folding hand, instead of sitting like
[2:21:41] this,
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; you need to jump in the water.
[2:21:45] [Applause]
[2:21:51] Hallelujah.
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you getting me. You who
[2:21:55] sleep in the church,
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; wake up.
[2:22:01] Sleep

[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; You who sleep in church,
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; every church you slumber like this.
[2:22:11] That's why the angel passes.
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; You who sit in the church like you lost,
[2:22:20] your mind is on the TV.
[2:22:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; Your mind is not in church.
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; The angel is coming and troubling the
[2:22:29] people. Yes, sir. and chopping the
[2:22:31] water.
[2:22:36] Wake up. Shake your hand. Jump fast.
[2:22:42] [Applause]
[2:22:47] &gt;&gt; In other word, when you coming in this
[2:22:49] church,
[2:22:51] &gt;&gt; always enter with expectation.
[2:22:55] [Applause]
[2:22:59] I don't know if you're getting me.
[2:23:02] &gt;&gt; Why are other people giving testimony
[2:23:05] and you don't?
[2:23:07] [Music]
[2:23:09] &gt;&gt; And you think it's normal. It's not
[2:23:11] normal.
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; When you enter to church, sit down and
[2:23:16] begin to watch the moving of the water.
[2:23:20] &gt;&gt; When sister Lin is singing, watch the
[2:23:22] moving of the water. When sister Yed is
[2:23:25] singing, watch the moving of the water.
[2:23:28] When Zad is singing, watch the moving of
[2:23:30] the water. When Tony is,
[2:23:35] &gt;&gt; watch the moving of the water. When you
[2:23:38] see the water begin to get sharp, raise
[2:23:41] your hand. Say, "Father, I am come."
[2:23:47] [Applause]
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together?
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's not the people.
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; You know sister Laura,
[2:24:02] &gt;&gt; you know sister divine.
[2:24:04] &gt;&gt; Did you ever seen her behaving and
[2:24:06] crying and going backward?
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; You need to wake up and say that is not
[2:24:10] sister divine. That is the Holy Spirit
[2:24:12] that have struck her. Pass me don't that
[2:24:15] pass me no gentle savior. If you touch
[2:24:18] her, I'm here too.
[2:24:22] I won't go home like that.
[2:24:24] I need to be touched.
[2:24:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:29] [Applause]
[2:24:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:24:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:24:38] &gt;&gt; Why?
[2:24:39] &gt;&gt; Why?
[2:24:40] &gt;&gt; Because the chopping of the water
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; is a signal that I'm here.
[2:24:46] &gt;&gt; God uses your brother to let you know
[2:24:49] that I'm here.
[2:24:51] So when you see your brother, you say,
[2:24:53] "Okay, so God is here.
[2:24:55] If God is here, take my request, take my
[2:24:59] blood pressure, take my diabetes, take
[2:25:03] my give me trouble, I'm going to go home
[2:25:05] free.
[2:25:07] I'm going to rise and take my bed and go
[2:25:10] home."
[2:25:13] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:25:15] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:25:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. In other words, I'm leaving the
[2:25:18] church with a testimony.
[2:25:22] [Applause]
[2:25:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together, my friend?
[2:25:27] &gt;&gt; I know some of you will say it's your
[2:25:29] character
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; or my character is quiet.
[2:25:33] &gt;&gt; Come in my office. Let me nail a needle
[2:25:35] on you.
[2:25:38] &gt;&gt; Come to my office. Let me poke you with
[2:25:41] a needle.
[2:25:42] &gt;&gt; I will see how quiet you are.
[2:25:45] You are lying.
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; You need to know the Holy Ghost.
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is a living being. It is
[2:25:53] life.
[2:25:54] [Applause]
[2:25:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:25:58] &gt;&gt; When you were in the world, why were you
[2:26:00] screaming?
[2:26:03] &gt;&gt; Why were you screaming? Yoohoo.
[2:26:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:26:05] &gt;&gt; And the church make you quiet. Brother
[2:26:08] Brandham say where God is there noises.
[2:26:12] Yes sir. Yes sir.
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; It is not empty nose. It is the chopping
[2:26:17] of the angel. When the word is coming
[2:26:20] forth, it create the stimulation of the
[2:26:23] revelation and the angel come down.
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; God doesn't send his word for nothing.
[2:26:32] And his word won't return back to him
[2:26:34] for nothing. He must accomplish. Father,
[2:26:38] let there be me today. That your word
[2:26:41] will deliver me when I leave this
[2:26:43] church. No more financial trouble, no
[2:26:46] more bad habit, no more headache, no
[2:26:50] more trouble, no more problem. I'm
[2:26:53] living free.
[2:26:55] [Applause]
[2:27:03] Yes, Lord.
[2:27:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:27:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; I have 8 minutes. I have not finished
[2:27:11] reading the Bible. I have 8 minutes

[2:27:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:16] &gt;&gt; I have not start reading. I have not
[2:27:18] start preaching yet. I only have 8
[2:27:19] minutes left for and and then my time is
[2:27:22] up.
[2:27:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:27:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:27:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; God
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; learned this season.
[2:27:30] Watch the season

[2:27:36] &gt;&gt; To you,
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; it's a building moving.
[2:27:39] &gt;&gt; Not to me.
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; Why is the messenger contacting me?
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; That's you.
[2:27:46] &gt;&gt; To me,
[2:27:47] &gt;&gt; it's tell me the time to build this is
[2:27:50] now.
[2:27:53] [Applause]
[2:27:54] &gt;&gt; Pastor, pastor, travel. I don't need to
[2:27:58] travel because my eyes are on the
[2:28:00] season. Yes, sir.
[2:28:01] &gt;&gt; Take a vacation. Leave me alone. I'm on
[2:28:04] the season. I must finish this building.
[2:28:06] The grace has already opened up.
[2:28:13] [Applause]
[2:28:18] What make what made Moses powerful?
[2:28:22] &gt;&gt; The season.
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; The season. It looks like Moses is
[2:28:26] unbeatable
[2:28:28] &gt;&gt; because Moses has been charged.
[2:28:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:31] &gt;&gt; By God. Whatever is in front of Moses,
[2:28:33] he will remove it.
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:28:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Steven, we hit the for the
[2:28:42] brother Robert, what was it? The septic
[2:28:44] tank. We need to unear the septic tank.
[2:28:46] And then an inspiration hit me.
[2:28:49] &gt;&gt; I said, "Brother Robert, what about if
[2:28:51] we scoop the building to the side a
[2:28:54] little bit?" Brother Robert say,
[2:28:55] "Brother Stephen, that's a good idea."
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; It was not me.
[2:28:59] &gt;&gt; I called the architect.
[2:29:01] &gt;&gt; The architect say, "Yes, you can go
[2:29:03] three feet." Why only three?
[2:29:07] [Applause]
[2:29:10] [Laughter]
[2:29:12] &gt;&gt; Why only three? In other word, the
[2:29:15] obstacle was trying to slow us down, but
[2:29:18] because it's the season, the building is
[2:29:21] moving,
[2:29:22] &gt;&gt; the work won't stop.
[2:29:24] &gt;&gt; The work won't stop.
[2:29:32] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together?

[2:29:44] life.

[2:29:51] you.
[2:29:52] &gt;&gt; But you just don't know when it's
[2:29:54] working.

[2:30:28] [Laughter]
[2:30:30] &gt;&gt; Before you know it, one begin to scream
[2:30:33] coming to the other one. Why? The angel
[2:30:35] was following something.

[2:30:42] home.
[2:30:45] &gt;&gt; He will follow you to your wife.

[2:31:09] the reading. So, we close. Where are we
[2:31:11] at, my friend?
[2:31:14] &gt;&gt; Verse four.

[2:31:18] what?
[2:31:18] &gt;&gt; A certain season.
[2:31:19] &gt;&gt; When?
[2:31:20] &gt;&gt; Into the pool.
[2:31:21] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. And did what?
[2:31:22] &gt;&gt; And troubled the water.
[2:31:23] &gt;&gt; Huh. Can you imagine what expectation
[2:31:25] those people were?
[2:31:26] &gt;&gt; Especially when the water begin to go
[2:31:28] like probably one already just went.
[2:31:32] &gt;&gt; He said, "Hey, no, it was just a wind.
[2:31:34] I'm sorry. I don't care if it was a
[2:31:36] wind, but I need to get out of this
[2:31:39] condition.
[2:31:41] I need to get out of this condition. You
[2:31:44] can make fun of me, no problem, but my
[2:31:47] eyes are on the water.
[2:31:50] One of this day I will come up
[2:31:52] &gt;&gt; with a testimony.
[2:31:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.

[2:33:17] &gt;&gt; An infirmity."
[2:33:21] &gt;&gt; Ah, how many years?

[2:34:30] you've been there for 38 years old. What
[2:34:32] are you doing here? Just go home."
[2:34:35] &gt;&gt; Because the man is going to explain
[2:34:37] himself.
[2:34:38] &gt;&gt; He will say, he's going to tell you. He
[2:34:40] say every time he tried to go,
[2:34:42] &gt;&gt; somebody else jump into it.

[2:34:48] &gt;&gt; No, sir. Why are you too quick to give?
[2:34:51] [Applause]
[2:34:54] &gt;&gt; Only three years.

[2:34:59] [Music]
[2:35:00] &gt;&gt; You ask God two years,
[2:35:02] &gt;&gt; it's not happening. You already
[2:35:03] depressed.
[2:35:05] &gt;&gt; I don't see why. I don't even feel like
[2:35:06] going to church.
[2:35:08] &gt;&gt; I don't even feel like singing.
[2:35:10] &gt;&gt; You will change pews from the first one.
[2:35:12] You go to the back. You go to the back.
[2:35:13] You go to the back. And then the last
[2:35:15] pew, then you start missing church. Then
[2:35:16] the deacon, you don't answer the deacon,
[2:35:18] then the deacon, then the deacon. And
[2:35:19] before you know it, you gone
[2:35:21] &gt;&gt; for what? For something, you ask God.
[2:35:23] But it's not happening according to your
[2:35:25] time.
[2:35:29] &gt;&gt; Because when it happened, so and so
[2:35:31] gathered. Not me. When it happened, so
[2:35:33] and so jump in the water. Not me. When
[2:35:35] it happened, so and so jump in the
[2:35:36] water. Not me. But God knew him.
[2:35:42] &gt;&gt; God knew him.
[2:35:44] I don't know if you together. So and so
[2:35:47] gather, you didn't get it. So and so
[2:35:49] gather, you didn't get. It doesn't mean
[2:35:51] God is not mindful of you.
[2:35:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. The angel that was coming in the
[2:35:58] water was now immor
[2:36:01] flesh.
[2:36:04] [Applause]
[2:36:08] My friend,
[2:36:09] &gt;&gt; the angel of the Lord that was troubling
[2:36:11] the world was now a human being.
[2:36:16] &gt;&gt; He became Jesus Christ.
[2:36:18] &gt;&gt; Mechisedc became Jesus Christ.
[2:36:21] &gt;&gt; And because he was made flesh,
[2:36:24] &gt;&gt; a new season open up.
[2:36:29] &gt;&gt; Now it's the word made flesh.
[2:36:33] [Applause]
[2:36:36] Are we together?
[2:36:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:36:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:36:40] &gt;&gt; And he went to church.
[2:36:43] &gt;&gt; He got into the pool.
[2:36:45] &gt;&gt; He said, "Where are you?
[2:36:47] &gt;&gt; Are you brother Christian? I came
[2:36:49] because of you. Only one person. You've
[2:36:52] been in that condition for so long.
[2:36:55] &gt;&gt; I'm now going to lay hand on you. Rise
[2:36:58] up. Take your feet and go home.
[2:37:01] Another
[2:37:07] season has opened up.
[2:37:10] &gt;&gt; Did the man ask Jesus, "Who are you?"
[2:37:12] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[2:37:13] &gt;&gt; Did he know Jesus Christ?
[2:37:15] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:37:16] &gt;&gt; What told him that what that man is
[2:37:18] saying is the truth?
[2:37:20] &gt;&gt; Because he was not an angel. He was a
[2:37:22] human being.
[2:37:24] &gt;&gt; He was not an angel. He was a human
[2:37:26] being. Like him. He was somebody that
[2:37:30] looked like you,
[2:37:32] &gt;&gt; but it's telling you I have come down
[2:37:35] &gt;&gt; for you.
[2:37:38] [Applause]
[2:37:41] &gt;&gt; Are you together?
[2:37:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:42] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:37:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:44] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:37:45] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said there was a
[2:37:47] multitude of the people
[2:37:48] &gt;&gt; and Jesus entered there. Brother said as
[2:37:51] Jesus was entering
[2:37:53] &gt;&gt; the mother begin to raise their children
[2:37:55] &gt;&gt; with a water head. They said, "Look at
[2:37:57] this one." And Jesus is passing.
[2:37:59] &gt;&gt; Say, "Where is the teddy at?"
[2:38:01] &gt;&gt; Where is he at?
[2:38:02] &gt;&gt; You.
[2:38:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:04] &gt;&gt; Let's read.
[2:38:06] &gt;&gt; Let's read. And And I'm going down to
[2:38:09] the airport, my friend. My airplane is
[2:38:10] coming this way. Where are we at, my
[2:38:12] friend?
[2:38:13] &gt;&gt; Verse five.
[2:38:14] &gt;&gt; Verse five. Verse 10. Verse 6. When
[2:38:16] Jesus do what?
[2:38:17] &gt;&gt; Saw him lie.
[2:38:18] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. Because brother Brandham said
[2:38:20] they asked Jesus a question. How did you
[2:38:22] do that? He said, I do nothing
[2:38:25] &gt;&gt; except what? My father showed me.
[2:38:27] &gt;&gt; So the father gave Jesus Christ the ID.
[2:38:32] &gt;&gt; He say when you go to spoken word,
[2:38:35] &gt;&gt; look at somebody that look the face like
[2:38:37] this.
[2:38:38] &gt;&gt; So when Jesus is coming, he's looking
[2:38:41] for your face.
[2:38:43] &gt;&gt; That's him.
[2:38:44] &gt;&gt; That's her.
[2:38:46] &gt;&gt; That's her.
[2:38:47] &gt;&gt; That's her.
[2:38:49] &gt;&gt; Look, the Bible say when Jesus saw him
[2:38:51] what? live
[2:38:53] &gt;&gt; and knew he saw him. How
[2:38:56] &gt;&gt; lie.
[2:39:03] &gt;&gt; Waiting for the angel.
[2:39:06] &gt;&gt; 38.
[2:39:08] &gt;&gt; If he goes to the to McDonald, he's
[2:39:11] going this way.
[2:39:14] &gt;&gt; You take $5. Go get me McDonald. Bring
[2:39:17] it to me.
[2:39:19] &gt;&gt; He bring McDonald. He said there
[2:39:22] &gt;&gt; waiting. Hallelujah. And when Jesus saw
[2:39:26] him how
[2:39:26] &gt;&gt; lie
[2:39:27] &gt;&gt; and knew God knows
[2:39:30] &gt;&gt; knew what
[2:39:31] &gt;&gt; that he had been now a long time in that
[2:39:34] case.
[2:39:35] &gt;&gt; God knows how long your case has been.
[2:39:41] &gt;&gt; Your problem God knows.
[2:39:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. The trouble you sitting in
[2:39:49] the church waiting for, God knows how
[2:39:52] long it's been.
[2:39:54] &gt;&gt; Maybe your neighbor don't know.
[2:39:56] &gt;&gt; Maybe the people that are sitting with
[2:39:57] you don't know.
[2:39:59] &gt;&gt; But there is more that knows.
[2:40:01] &gt;&gt; And what matter is for him to know.
[2:40:04] &gt;&gt; Because he's the one that give the
[2:40:06] healing.
[2:40:08] &gt;&gt; The Bible say when Jesus see saw him lie
[2:40:11] and knew that he had been for what
[2:40:13] &gt;&gt; a long time. In that case
[2:40:16] &gt;&gt; he says to him
[2:40:19] &gt;&gt; what
[2:40:19] &gt;&gt; wilt thou be made whole?
[2:40:22] &gt;&gt; What question
[2:40:24] &gt;&gt; which our society will call a dumb
[2:40:28] question
[2:40:32] &gt;&gt; to begin with? To begin with what is he
[2:40:34] doing in the in in the pool of Bethesda?
[2:40:39] &gt;&gt; Because those that sat there are how
[2:40:41] lame blind widow and trouble. So how do
[2:40:44] you want and ask somebody who's sitting
[2:40:46] in the hospital? You say do you want to
[2:40:47] get here? Why is he in the hospital to
[2:40:49] begin with?
[2:40:50] &gt;&gt; He came to the hospital to do what?
[2:40:54] &gt;&gt; To get here. But Jesus come and ask him.
[2:40:57] Say, do you want to get here?
[2:41:00] &gt;&gt; Do you really mean what you're asking
[2:41:02] for?
[2:41:04] &gt;&gt; Do you really mean it?
[2:41:06] &gt;&gt; Do you really want it?
[2:41:09] &gt;&gt; Because you can talk all you want, but
[2:41:11] do you want it?
[2:41:13] [Music]
[2:41:16] Oh Lord, heal me. Do you want the
[2:41:17] healing?
[2:41:20] &gt;&gt; Of you do, this is what Jesus said. Will
[2:41:22] you be made whole?
[2:41:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:41:24] &gt;&gt; The important man answered him and say
[2:41:27] what
[2:41:28] &gt;&gt; sir?
[2:41:28] &gt;&gt; What?
[2:41:29] &gt;&gt; I have no man.
[2:41:30] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:41:31] &gt;&gt; When the water is troubled,
[2:41:33] &gt;&gt; put me into the pool.
[2:41:34] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:41:35] &gt;&gt; But while I am coming,
[2:41:36] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:41:36] &gt;&gt; another stepth down before me.
[2:41:38] &gt;&gt; Question. Was that the answer?
[2:41:41] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:41:43] [Laughter]
[2:41:45] Did I ask you uh what is your difficulty
[2:41:48] to get to the water?
[2:41:50] &gt;&gt; I ask you do you want to get here? Look
[2:41:54] human being
[2:41:56] [Music]
[2:41:59] &gt;&gt; in other words the season have come the
[2:42:01] opportunity has come
[2:42:03] &gt;&gt; and say do you want to get it and then
[2:42:05] you go you know uh let me explain you
[2:42:07] you know what I'm saying
[2:42:09] &gt;&gt; when every time I want to go to the
[2:42:11] water
[2:42:12] &gt;&gt; you see the parameter here there is two
[2:42:14] feet and five second here when I try to
[2:42:17] go did I ask you all of that
[2:42:20] &gt;&gt; do you want to get here but the god
[2:42:22] which in mercy
[2:42:23] [Applause]
[2:42:26] [Laughter]
[2:42:28] The God rich in mercy didn't even listen
[2:42:31] to the explanation. In other words, he's
[2:42:33] blinded to the season. I am the season.
[2:42:38] &gt;&gt; I am the one you're looking for. I am
[2:42:40] the angel.
[2:42:42] &gt;&gt; I come for you
[2:42:45] [Applause]
[2:42:50] &gt;&gt; based on the answer. Amen.
[2:42:53] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm landing the ship. They said
[2:42:55] based on the answer, Jesus could have
[2:42:58] dodged him.
[2:43:01] &gt;&gt; Jesus could have said, "You know what?
[2:43:02] You didn't answer my question. Let me
[2:43:04] move on." But because
[2:43:07] &gt;&gt; the command
[2:43:08] &gt;&gt; was already given for that man
[2:43:14] &gt;&gt; even Jesus cannot change
[2:43:19] &gt;&gt; because the day was your day. The day
[2:43:22] was the day of the young man.
[2:43:25] [Applause]
[2:43:28] &gt;&gt; And let me finish by this my friend. And
[2:43:31] Jesus said to him, "What?
[2:43:32] &gt;&gt; Rise.
[2:43:33] &gt;&gt; Do what? take up thy bed
[2:43:35] &gt;&gt; and what?
[2:43:35] &gt;&gt; And walk.
[2:43:36] &gt;&gt; What a command.
[2:43:39] &gt;&gt; In other words, don't go. Maybe he was
[2:43:41] expecting Jesus to say, "Go jump in the
[2:43:43] water."
[2:43:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus say, "Rise."
[2:43:47] &gt;&gt; If you really mean it.
[2:43:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:43:50] &gt;&gt; If you really mean it.
[2:43:52] &gt;&gt; If you really mean it.
[2:43:54] &gt;&gt; Okay. Show me your faith. Rise.
[2:43:58] &gt;&gt; Take up your bed
[2:44:00] &gt;&gt; and go. What happened to the man? Amen.
[2:44:03] &gt;&gt; Verse nine. And what?
[2:44:04] &gt;&gt; And immediately
[2:44:05] &gt;&gt; what happened?
[2:44:06] &gt;&gt; The man was made whole.
[2:44:07] &gt;&gt; And what?
[2:44:08] &gt;&gt; And took up his bed.
[2:44:09] &gt;&gt; And what?
[2:44:09] &gt;&gt; And walked.
[2:44:10] &gt;&gt; On the same day, he was what?
[2:44:12] &gt;&gt; The Sabbath.
[2:44:13] &gt;&gt; Who was carrying the man first? The bed.
[2:44:16] But now what happened to the man?
[2:44:18] &gt;&gt; Who's carrying who?
[2:44:19] &gt;&gt; The man carrying the bed.
[2:44:21] &gt;&gt; Who's carrying who?
[2:44:22] &gt;&gt; The man carrying the bed.
[2:44:23] &gt;&gt; What does he tell you about it, my
[2:44:25] friend?
[2:44:26] &gt;&gt; What was carrying you, you begin to
[2:44:28] carry it.
[2:44:31] &gt;&gt; Spoken word. Does he tell you something?
[2:44:33] &gt;&gt; Because in this message, we were told of
[2:44:35] the third vision.
[2:44:36] &gt;&gt; All right, brother.
[2:44:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:39] &gt;&gt; In the third vision, when you come in,
[2:44:43] &gt;&gt; the wheelchair carry you.
[2:44:45] &gt;&gt; But when you going out,
[2:44:47] &gt;&gt; you are pushing the wheelchair.
[2:44:50] &gt;&gt; Listen my friend, today is your day.
[2:44:58] You might have missed many season
[2:45:00] &gt;&gt; but the God of the season is here.
[2:45:03] &gt;&gt; I don't know what's going on in your
[2:45:05] life. God is manful that you suffer for
[2:45:08] so long. And if you believe it, rise up
[2:45:12] and thank him for it.
[2:45:16] [Applause]
[2:45:22] Let's stand my friend
[2:45:25] &gt;&gt; because another season have opened up
[2:45:28] when God is revealed in human flesh.
[2:45:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Thank you Lord. Amen.

[2:45:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:45:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:39] &gt;&gt; Never compare this church service to the
[2:45:41] last week. Last week was another season.
[2:45:44] &gt;&gt; Wednesday was another season. Today is
[2:45:47] another season.
[2:45:53] &gt;&gt; In other words, every time you going to
[2:45:55] church, God is opening a season.
[2:45:58] [Applause]
[2:46:03] [Music]
[2:46:07] Heavenly Father,

[2:46:16] &gt;&gt; for your love and your mercy, Father,

[2:46:28] What we prepare was not what you wanted
[2:46:30] to be delivered today. Father, you want
[2:46:32] this to be delivered today.
[2:46:35] &gt;&gt; And it's not coming from a note. It's
[2:46:37] coming fresh from the throne of heaven.
