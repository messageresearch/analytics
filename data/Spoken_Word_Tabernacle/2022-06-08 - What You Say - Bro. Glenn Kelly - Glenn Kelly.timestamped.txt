[39:14] hallelujah
[39:16] the devil is fighting left and right
[39:20] left and right but i know why he's upset
[39:23] because things has been unfolded but
[39:25] we're not backing up we're going to get
[39:27] into the holiest amen
[39:29] blessed be the name of the lord you keep
[39:32] remembering brother michael daley and
[39:35] sister
[39:36] bridgenet in their trip in uh
[39:39] in jamaica for the funeral so i have not
[39:42] heard anything about uh
[39:44] his mother yet but once he come back by
[39:47] god's grace we will know what's going on
[39:49] amen
[39:50] everybody okay with soul and obedience
[39:54] everybody got it clearly is it difficult
[39:57] to enter the holiest
[39:59] this gospel is not complicated
[40:02] it's very easy
[40:04] total obedience
[40:06] just a total obedience to christ
[40:08] will bring you into christ
[40:11] just do what he tells you to do that's
[40:13] all
[40:14] amen you do what he tells you to do turn
[40:17] go to the priest you just turn you start
[40:19] going to the priest
[40:21] then your leprosy is gone
[40:23] amen
[40:24] easy as it can be amen it's not
[40:27] complicated so if you were expecting a
[40:29] big formula to get into the holiest it's
[40:32] not too big amen so you keep praying for
[40:35] me i know the devil is fighting left and
[40:37] right especially when i am
[40:39] trying to get into the holiest
[40:42] the book of roof it's a special book
[40:45] you just hit one chapter and he opened
[40:49] the whole sermon just one word
[40:52] one word in the book of just one and
[40:54] then rook
[40:55] then everything open and then when i try
[40:57] to look into it it keeps unfolding just
[40:59] one word this is chapter three verse one
[41:02] just rather that's it it's a problem
[41:04] amen so you pray for me i need time i
[41:07] need to sit i need to search and then be
[41:09] under the holy spirit to kind of glean
[41:11] what he's trying to bring
[41:13] because this gotta be as clear as it can
[41:16] be there is no way the new birth can be
[41:19] complicated i believe at this stage
[41:21] everybody should know where you are
[41:24] whether you are in the other court
[41:25] whether you are in a holy place whether
[41:27] you are in the holy somehow you must
[41:30] know where you are and if you know where
[41:32] you are you're not there yet do not stop
[41:35] do not get discouraged it's time to wake
[41:37] up and just start moving and moving
[41:40] whatever needs to be cleaned up clean it
[41:42] up take it away don't wait for god to
[41:44] come down and then remove it no you do
[41:47] your part and let god handle his part
[41:49] amen
[41:52] amen
[41:53] oh my god blessed be the name of the
[41:56] lord tonight brother kelly is the one
[41:58] preaching
[42:00] it has been a while now we're back to
[42:02] the home folks amen so they've been
[42:04] soaking soaking soaking now it's time
[42:07] for them to start explosion again amen
[42:10] so you know brother kelly you pull on
[42:12] the gift of the lord and lord willing we
[42:15] will be blessed tonight god knows what
[42:17] you're going through
[42:19] god knows exactly what is tomorrow
[42:22] there is nothing that is surprising god
[42:25] brother branham says sometimes his nose
[42:29] they know of god the no of god
[42:32] are better than his yeses
[42:35] amen
[42:36] and when you look later on you will find
[42:38] out that i praise god this happened
[42:40] probably that was not the right i was
[42:42] supposed to be taking i should have gone
[42:45] a different route amen
[42:46] so keep pressing on the battle
[42:48] everything is okay
[42:50] everything will be on time nobody is
[42:53] going to be late we're not going to lose
[42:54] the rapture the rupture belongs to us
[42:58] if you talk about the rupture you cannot
[43:00] talk the rap
[43:01] about the rapture without me
[43:04] if you talk if somebody is telling you
[43:05] the rapture without brother stephen tell
[43:07] him it's wrong
[43:09] you need to put yourself like that
[43:11] you cannot i will send you elijah
[43:14] that was me
[43:16] that's why you cannot separate me from
[43:18] elijah
[43:20] did you get that there is no way you can
[43:23] separate me from elijah the prophet
[43:25] because elijah the prophet was sent
[43:27] because of me
[43:28] [Music]
[43:30] so that scripture is brother brother in
[43:32] me
[43:36] so how can you remove me from brother
[43:37] branham
[43:40] you see
[43:41] you see
[43:42] if you remove one you gotta remove
[43:44] another one
[43:45] but i know you cannot because it was
[43:47] written before even i was born
[43:49] because the bible says that before you
[43:51] were even forming a mother's womb god
[43:54] knew you
[43:55] amen and he already ordained you to be a
[43:58] prophet
[44:00] god knew everything
[44:02] god knew we're going to be in this
[44:03] church
[44:04] nothing is surprising him
[44:06] amen so don't worry all is well let's
[44:10] sing only believe
[44:12] oh
[44:14] lee believe
[44:19] only

[48:02] 21 21 and peter calling to the
[48:05] remembrance
[48:06] said unto him master behold the fig tree
[48:09] which thou curse is withered the way
[48:12] and jesus answers said unto them
[48:15] have faith in god
[48:17] for verily i say unto you that whosoever
[48:20] shall say unto this mountain be thou
[48:22] removed and be thou cast into the sea
[48:26] and shall not doubt in this heart
[48:29] see
[48:30] no doubt right now we're going higher
[48:32] tonight saints the holy spirit's going
[48:34] to take his side tonight
[48:36] we're getting ready to move into
[48:38] something there's something more we're
[48:39] already moving he says but he's
[48:42] but thou remove and be and cast out into
[48:46] the sea and shall not doubt in his heart
[48:48] but shall believe that those things
[48:50] which he
[48:52] he saith shall come to pass
[48:56] he shall have whatsoever he sayeth
[48:59] he's therefore i say unto you what
[49:02] things so ever you desire
[49:05] when ye pray believe that ye receive
[49:08] receive them and ye shall have them may
[49:11] the lord add a blessing to the reading
[49:12] of his word you may be seated we're
[49:14] gonna work with tonight what you say
[49:20] here's what you say
[49:22] you know the prophet of god work with
[49:24] this in perfect faith
[49:26] but you know we can't leave it just
[49:28] there
[49:29] so just bear with me and pray with me i
[49:31] know it's wednesday night by the grace
[49:33] of god but we're going to move into
[49:35] something here because this is perfect
[49:37] faith
[49:38] is that right because we've been hearing
[49:40] from god we thank the lord saints we're
[49:43] going to move and we're going to put it
[49:44] on back what the power and authority
[49:47] that god has given his bride in this age
[49:50] is that right
[49:52] some of people are going to be wondering
[49:54] what's going on in their lives because
[49:56] the true believer is going to their
[49:58] catching up hold up is what they say
[50:02] is what they pray is what they ask
[50:05] is that right and you shall receive them
[50:08] now the spoken word is coming to pass we
[50:10] won't be able to get into all this
[50:12] tonight we're going to just touch some
[50:14] things but we want to lay a foundation
[50:17] by the grace of god and let the holy
[50:19] spirit have his way
[50:20] so we know that faith here is showing us
[50:24] is based upon forgiveness is that right
[50:27] faith has to be based upon forgiveness
[50:30] if you've got an art in your heart then
[50:32] something's wrong you know what
[50:34] you know we was telling them today when
[50:36] we just left them over to jail we was
[50:39] working with the message was think right
[50:42] do right it'll turn out right
[50:46] you know you're telling me think right
[50:48] you do right it turned out right
[50:50] you see because you never see doing
[50:52] something wrong turn out will turn out
[50:55] right is that right but you see doing
[50:57] what's right it'll turn out right it
[51:00] will not turn out wrong is that right
[51:02] because the footsteps of the righteous
[51:05] is ordered of the lord so we're moving
[51:07] into something here so we know that the
[51:10] prophet of god talked about this perfect
[51:12] faith
[51:13] this perfect faith that god didn't talk
[51:15] brother robert i heard him sung the song
[51:17] about coming up that ladder that statute
[51:20] of that perfect man is that right
[51:22] that foundation of it was what faith is
[51:25] that right this thing is and we know in
[51:28] this hour here now you got to have this
[51:30] faith that's working by love
[51:33] is that right this love for the word
[51:35] that god has brought us back and is our
[51:37] here now in the beginning was the word
[51:40] the word was god the word was with god
[51:42] and the word was made flesh is that
[51:44] right so we're talking about walking
[51:47] doing what's right we're going to get in
[51:48] our message i'm just letting them have
[51:50] this way right now is that right we
[51:52] talking about we know that we're going
[51:54] into a trip somewhere to go fellowship
[51:57] some is going for different reasons they
[51:59] know and god know where they're going is
[52:01] that right uh oh
[52:04] but you better make sure the word of the
[52:06] lord he sees everything is that right
[52:09] and i pray some of you young men step it
[52:12] up i was there praying today is that
[52:14] right man
[52:16] you got you got some beautiful brides in
[52:19] this church
[52:20] ah
[52:21] i'm gonna tell you something huh let me
[52:24] get out there we're talking about truth
[52:26] be talking about what god is bringing us
[52:28] in this hour what the lord told us first
[52:31] over there in the song of solomon
[52:33] chapter four first she become your
[52:35] sister is that right how does she become
[52:37] your sister and then you have fellowship
[52:39] with her then she can become your bride
[52:42] is that right so you first you look upon
[52:44] the best is that right you got to look
[52:47] upon the best i remember when we came
[52:49] here and we had that wedding here the
[52:51] first wedding that we had here is that
[52:53] right i'ma tell you there's more in that
[52:55] wedding need to go back and look and see
[52:57] what god really did that was the first
[53:00] wedding now that's the way god wanted
[53:03] that wedding to be brought forth i had
[53:05] an opportunity to go back there and look
[53:07] at them when they was practicing and
[53:09] before they was practicing you know
[53:11] brother steve i saw the young boy's eye
[53:13] they were standing around in there and i
[53:16] know how the african applicants like to
[53:18] do it now when it comes to a wedding
[53:19] right and when the photo they come
[53:21] around and then and the fella he was
[53:23] just shaking just standing there shaking
[53:25] and he was standing up here and i was
[53:27] looking at it and he got around i said
[53:29] yeah right you think god gonna let you
[53:31] walk down that aisle when that wedding
[53:32] starts in this church here ain't no way
[53:35] is that right ah and it was coming
[53:37] around in there and they wanted to show
[53:39] off is that right but i'ma tell you
[53:42] something when that wedding came the
[53:44] first wedding came in here those young
[53:47] fellas that were standing around there
[53:49] shaking when they was up here during the
[53:51] practice but when the time the wedding
[53:53] came they came down the aisle like this
[54:02] the holy ghost came down in it he made
[54:05] sure he was going to come down there
[54:07] this is the first wedding he told you
[54:09] how the first wedding was going to be
[54:11] they humbled yourself they recognized
[54:13] they was in the presence of god the way
[54:16] they practiced it wasn't going to happen
[54:17] in the real wedding is that right
[54:21] now we're talking about
[54:26] some of y'all going looking for a
[54:27] husband think the holy ghost don't know
[54:29] i know you're going looking for a
[54:31] husband ain't nothing wrong with that
[54:34] nothing wrong with that but i'm gonna
[54:36] tell you something
[54:37] brother steve in that first wedding the
[54:40] holy ghost said god showed us the
[54:42] pattern of the first wedding is that
[54:44] right
[54:45] ah
[54:47] sister if a man wanted to come up to you
[54:50] and he decide he wants to marry you ah
[54:53] the holy ghost told us first thing said
[54:56] do he had the holy ghost
[55:04] he gave adam the holy ghost
[55:06] it's for somebody in here somebody's
[55:09] going to be approached you got to find
[55:11] out how does he have the holy ghost
[55:16] huh
[55:18] then the second thing you want to split
[55:20] the whole negotiation i'm gonna give him
[55:22] a job do you have a job
[55:26] huh he gave adam a job is that right
[55:30] adam was all over the land adam was in
[55:33] charge of the land he gave adam a job is
[55:36] that right
[55:37] huh
[55:38] so you see those two things and then
[55:40] they have to realize is he becoming
[55:42] quite the companionship he working in a
[55:45] companionship you and him become one is
[55:48] that right hallelujah let's give him a
[55:50] clap off and i don't know how we got on
[55:53] that
[55:54] huh
[55:55] but i know it's for somebody thank you
[55:57] jesus
[55:58] hallelujah
[55:59] because you got the word the word is
[56:02] protecting you is that right you are
[56:05] sent up under the word this is the holy
[56:07] ghost in the morning this is the holy
[56:09] ghost ministry in these end times is
[56:12] that right
[56:13] hallelujah
[56:15] thank you jesus
[56:17] he's talking about perfect faith
[56:19] this is a different type of faith
[56:22] that's a great faith
[56:24] see
[56:25] this kind of faith that you're talking
[56:27] about here we're going to read we're
[56:28] going to read some things from the
[56:30] prophet and we're gonna get into the
[56:31] scriptures
[56:32] but you have to understand this is the
[56:33] hour now brother steve i kept hearing
[56:36] the holy ghost said when he got in that
[56:38] legalistic in the work that we had to do
[56:41] and he said in that legalistic form he
[56:43] said you had to confess
[56:44] and then they had to believe is that
[56:46] right
[56:47] when their confession they believe in
[56:49] the word of god
[56:50] now we're standing on the word of god of
[56:53] promise that god has brought us in this
[56:56] hour in this day it's what you say
[57:00] you're just thinking it's what you
[57:02] believe
[57:04] now something comes and revealed it to
[57:06] you but there's certain things that you
[57:08] have to have for you to speak those
[57:11] words for you to believe those words it
[57:14] can be no condemnation in your heart
[57:18] you mean nothing in your heart against
[57:21] anyone
[57:22] that's why the lord i've been having the
[57:24] time in the dales ah i'm telling you huh
[57:28] i know that i had a desire to get back
[57:30] there and god opened that jail just for
[57:32] me is that right oh
[57:34] but it's certain people freeze brothers
[57:36] theme is shutting them free in their
[57:38] minds and setting them free in the
[57:40] spirit let me tell you the first time
[57:42] when i went in then when i first went in
[57:44] there i went to a blocker in the first
[57:46] block i went to brother steve the fellow
[57:48] was in there the first time they looked
[57:51] up and they said we had just been
[57:52] looking for someone not even a minute
[57:55] ago and we spoke it up and here you come
[57:58] and when he come through the door let me
[58:00] tell you what the lord was doing in
[58:02] there
[58:03] he got on there and the lord turned
[58:04] around the fellas was studying elijah

[1:04:05] they believe in all these decisions
[1:04:07] you know so they're saying this
[1:04:09] according to the denominational way but
[1:04:12] if you truly make a decision you truly
[1:04:14] repent
[1:04:15] then what are you going to do you're
[1:04:17] going to continue to move forth is that
[1:04:19] right after you move from justification
[1:04:21] sanctification baptism of the holy ghost
[1:04:24] into the holiness of the holy is that
[1:04:26] right now when you're moving down in
[1:04:28] there we're moving down into that
[1:04:30] adoption is that right we know who we
[1:04:32] are once you recognize you are the
[1:04:34] predestinated seed of god you are the
[1:04:38] royal priesthood of a royal generation
[1:04:41] now you have to move when you act like
[1:04:43] it is that right

[1:13:38] free nothing's going to set you free but
[1:13:40] the truth
[1:13:41] and nobody but the truth so we have to
[1:13:43] realize in his hour here now we bring
[1:13:46] him into the knowledge of who they are
[1:13:48] is that right we tell them and you look
[1:13:50] at moses when moses was there is that
[1:13:53] right moses couldn't know this was then
[1:13:55] his mother knew he was going to be what
[1:13:57] a redeemer is that right come back and
[1:14:00] leave the people out of egypt but what
[1:14:02] happened man god hidden in simplicity
[1:14:05] who know the mind of god no one but when
[1:14:08] they got in there they always told moses
[1:14:11] he's sending his father and his mother
[1:14:13] fear not what this is the king is that
[1:14:16] right they fear not the king so what she
[1:14:18] did she send them down the road send
[1:14:20] them down to now is that right put them
[1:14:23] in the basket they anointed it right
[1:14:25] sealed it with the holy ghost with the
[1:14:27] inside and on the outside but our faith
[1:14:30] thought it was a faith that was working
[1:14:33] by love god he said lord god you've gave
[1:14:36] me this child here i'm sending them
[1:14:38] there in the now father i'm following
[1:14:40] your instructions lord jesus
[1:14:42] you showed me he was a proper child he
[1:14:45] showed you he was a proper child there
[1:14:47] he showed you he was a proper child
[1:14:50] there he showed you he was a proper
[1:14:52] child there so god provided way for
[1:14:55] leading them away why getting blessed
[1:14:57] say the lord in the end time your
[1:14:59] children you're the proper child now you
[1:15:02] look at him you move along is that right
[1:15:05] man you're coming out here now we train
[1:15:08] up a child in the way that he should go
[1:15:10] when he grow old he will not depart from
[1:15:13] it he may go to the left he may go to
[1:15:15] the right though but now he's seen what
[1:15:18] he's seeing the truth is that right
[1:15:20] remember the old rider when women little
[1:15:22] boy when the boy had to ride
[1:15:25] the bike and when the sizzy boy had to
[1:15:27] get there and they had to ride the bike
[1:15:29] and once he got there and they rode the
[1:15:30] bike uh he got over there and they said
[1:15:32] so whoever winner will win the prize is
[1:15:35] that right you want to know why you're
[1:15:37] and there's all this words you know why
[1:15:38] you're getting this anointing you know
[1:15:40] why god is coming in opening this word
[1:15:43] is because why he's just a boy he looked
[1:15:46] back and he got there and the other boys
[1:15:49] didn't win the race they fell off he
[1:15:51] wrote it all the way to the end and he
[1:15:53] wanted to know how to do it he said well
[1:15:56] boys let me tell you something he said i
[1:15:59] kept the eyes on christ but the main
[1:16:01] thing i watched when you made a mistake
[1:16:04] i watch with you be wrong you know he
[1:16:08] sat there for 12 years being faithful
[1:16:11] being obedient watching when he always
[1:16:13] was he realized god said i'm going to
[1:16:16] sit you down
[1:16:18] i want you to watch be obedient
[1:16:21] i'ma raise you up for something else
[1:16:25] moses mother
[1:16:26] he send them down there and when she
[1:16:28] send them down that knob
[1:16:30] is that right moses was going to be the
[1:16:32] deliverer but when you tell those
[1:16:34] inmates that moses grew up they have a
[1:16:37] commercial slightly ahead of your time
[1:16:40] by panasonic well moses got slightly
[1:16:42] ahead of his time is that right and when
[1:16:45] he got slightly ahead of his time but
[1:16:47] the word of prophecy still was going to
[1:16:49] be fulfilled
[1:16:51] in a word of prophecy god said he was
[1:16:53] going to send a kingsman redeemer out
[1:16:56] there with him is that right so moses
[1:16:58] brother when he got there pharaoh's
[1:17:00] daughter got him and after he got
[1:17:02] involved stevie turner she said we need
[1:17:04] someone to take care of them we need
[1:17:06] someone to raise them we need someone to
[1:17:09] bring them up in the way so who did god

[1:19:19] these things is that right your brother
[1:19:21] kelly that's right you got to be humble
[1:19:23] to take a job like that you're at the
[1:19:25] bottom and we got there and they didn't
[1:19:28] realize i'm brother greg stripping wax
[1:19:31] floors pull up tile replace those things
[1:19:34] go out in the rain and things when you
[1:19:36] everyone else didn't have to go out
[1:19:38] there but you know at the time when the
[1:19:41] founder originally made that made that
[1:19:43] he says the most important job
[1:19:46] with the whole company
[1:19:48] the number one discount department store
[1:19:50] in the world
[1:19:52] he said it was maintenance
[1:19:54] he said because why do people come and
[1:19:56] repeat you have repeated customers
[1:19:58] because of the cleanliness of your store
[1:20:01] if you're riding down the road and you
[1:20:03] got your wife with you and you remember
[1:20:05] that place over there wasn't clean no
[1:20:07] honey let's go down a little farther we
[1:20:09] can't go to that one you see
[1:20:12] but we was there one night we was there
[1:20:15] and the fella come in there he said
[1:20:17] somebody was running out the front door
[1:20:18] with some electronics these signs shall
[1:20:21] follow them that believe the gospel
[1:20:23] wasn't preached so we got out there they
[1:20:25] told us not to go so far the uh past
[1:20:28] that poll if you did for our safety so
[1:20:31] when the father kept going he went out
[1:20:33] the door i said the lord see everything
[1:20:42] i said the lord see everything
[1:20:45] he turned he stopped
[1:20:47] he's a preacher you're the preacher
[1:20:51] huh he ain't bringing them goods back
[1:20:53] though you see he kept right on going
[1:20:56] but i'm saying the point is you don't
[1:20:58] know they never know who's going to see
[1:21:00] you is that right they never know and
[1:21:03] that same fellow that came through there
[1:21:06] he remembered me coming into the jail
[1:21:08] preaching the gospel to him is that
[1:21:10] right so we're telling you these things
[1:21:12] saints we had another one coming in some
[1:21:14] of them i'm telling you they're doing
[1:21:15] good all those not bad
[1:21:18] these signs shall follow them that
[1:21:19] believer if you believe that this gospel
[1:21:22] can set a man free then you would tell
[1:21:24] someone about the cross you would tell
[1:21:27] them about christ you would tell them
[1:21:29] how to truly repent because now a
[1:21:32] godless sorrow bring a godly repentance
[1:21:34] that he doesn't have to repent anymore
[1:21:36] brother steve i could go in them jails
[1:21:38] and then down and tell that man you know
[1:21:40] what he tell that man wait a minute
[1:21:43] brother you gotta go back to the
[1:21:44] praising of time
[1:21:47] you haven't repented the right way yet
[1:21:52] you gotta be truly sorry
[1:21:54] if you come there
[1:21:56] once you repent right the holy ghost
[1:21:59] will lead you the rest of the way is
[1:22:01] that what they have to do he's going to
[1:22:03] lead you he's going to guide you well
[1:22:06] it's not just some mysteries i hear him
[1:22:08] talking about all just the mysteries
[1:22:11] some of them talk about this some of
[1:22:13] them is truly appreciating it some of
[1:22:15] them catching what it really is what the
[1:22:18] lord is opening up to us every prophet
[1:22:21] in the scripture saw the plan of
[1:22:23] redemption for their time
[1:22:29] god has given us the revelation of the
[1:22:32] true plan of redemption
[1:22:37] if you don't get it right right at that
[1:22:39] altar if you don't get it right at that
[1:22:41] altar that's why you were struggling
[1:22:42] with certain things is that right huh i
[1:22:45] told him you can't get upset with you
[1:22:47] you don't like your nose
[1:22:49] huh you don't like your ears you don't
[1:22:52] like your lips
[1:22:53] you don't like your neck
[1:22:55] you don't like that
[1:22:57] what you getting upset for god don't
[1:22:59] make no mistakes
[1:23:01] god don't make no mistakes
[1:23:03] god made the best
[1:23:05] god made you he saw you before the
[1:23:08] foundation of the world get rid of that
[1:23:10] complex the real you is down in your
[1:23:13] soul is that right what the holy spirit
[1:23:15] is telling us that's why the holy spirit
[1:23:17] say in the legalistic way you gotta do
[1:23:21] it why because he's giving us what oh
[1:23:24] free more real
[1:23:30] you gotta be there
[1:23:32] imagination
[1:23:34] reasoning conscious affection
[1:23:36] these things are all free more will
[1:23:40] that's what the lord has given us in his
[1:23:42] hour that's why so many christians get
[1:23:44] thrown off and think they got the holy
[1:23:47] ghost and he's just giving you a spirit
[1:23:49] to deal with yourself
[1:23:52] you gotta move on in
[1:23:54] but god who's rich in mercy
[1:23:56] saved the best for last is that right he
[1:24:00] thought he had us drug users he thought
[1:24:02] he had us drug dealers he thought he had
[1:24:04] us homosexuals he thought he had these
[1:24:07] lesbians he thought he had you gamblers
[1:24:10] he thought he had the drinkers drinkers
[1:24:12] he thought he had his all these steelers
[1:24:14] these
[1:24:16] he thought he had liars he thought he
[1:24:18] had you uh um bound up with those demon
[1:24:21] forces but if you catch what happened at
[1:24:24] the cross at the cross and jesus said
[1:24:28] before the foundation of the rail he
[1:24:31] slew the land he was already we could
[1:24:34] not have been lost he just brought us
[1:24:37] that way saints god whose rich emotion
[1:24:41] already had a plan
[1:24:54] he said now look
[1:24:55] the identification is scripted christian
[1:24:58] these words say jesus these signs have
[1:25:00] followed them that belief now how can
[1:25:02] you call yourself a believer a people
[1:25:05] and deny those words
[1:25:10] be moving somewhere saints perfect faith
[1:25:14] if the prophet preached it then that
[1:25:15] mean is is reachable
[1:25:18] [Music]
[1:25:21] and it's time to come on and grab it
[1:25:23] isn't that right this is what he's
[1:25:25] moving us into perfect this is a faith
[1:25:28] that's working by love
[1:25:30] love is faith in sinneth
[1:25:32] it keeps them going so we have to see
[1:25:35] what the lord is bringing us in here for
[1:25:37] god so loved the world for you know my
[1:25:40] disciples they'll keep my commandments
[1:25:42] and they'll have love you for one
[1:25:44] another if someone come against you or
[1:25:47] someone saying something you love them
[1:25:49] you pray for them you make your love
[1:25:51] circle bigger is that right make it
[1:25:54] bigger saints
[1:25:56] he said now look
[1:25:57] he said because you're not a believer he
[1:26:00] said
[1:26:01] well you can see and deny any of these
[1:26:04] words you can you can't do it
[1:26:08] you're not a believer therefore signs
[1:26:10] can follow can't follow
[1:26:13] because just accept what you want you to
[1:26:15] believe and let the rest of it see
[1:26:18] that's all the holy spirit been been
[1:26:20] ministering take this part of the
[1:26:22] message
[1:26:23] thought i'd throw this i don't believe
[1:26:24] this part of the message take this part
[1:26:26] of the scriptures i don't believe this
[1:26:28] part of the scriptures huh
[1:26:32] let me keep going he says oh
[1:26:35] he says and when you truly believe
[1:26:39] not make believe
[1:26:41] but really believe
[1:26:43] then these signs shall follow them that
[1:26:45] belief
[1:26:48] oh could you compare it christian today
[1:26:50] with those christians
[1:26:51] he says now he
[1:26:53] he says i preached on the other night a
[1:26:56] prisoner you're a prisoner to the word
[1:26:58] of god
[1:27:02] he says he couldn't even move until god
[1:27:05] moved him
[1:27:08] a real servant of god cannot even move
[1:27:12] until the holy ghost tells them to move
[1:27:17] and then when the holy ghost tells them
[1:27:20] to move you can move is that right
[1:27:23] huh perfect faith

[1:31:15] that's why we take the message we take
[1:31:17] the scriptures you take the message you
[1:31:20] take the scriptures and they both are
[1:31:22] what one is that right they can't
[1:31:26] deviate is that right they gotta be
[1:31:28] there but you gotta have what the holy
[1:31:31] ghost came down and showed us in the
[1:31:33] first seal was that right there in the
[1:31:35] second seal i was telling the fella
[1:31:37] every time i come in there brother steve
[1:31:39] he always come around there and go to
[1:31:41] the jail and he's sitting there you
[1:31:43] always got one you know that's going to
[1:31:44] be there that's why he locked up he got
[1:31:46] around in there he ain't humbling
[1:31:48] himself yet so we're coming in there
[1:31:50] trying to tell them the word of god he
[1:31:52] said well you know the trumpets done
[1:31:54] already don't pass you know we're just
[1:31:56] about getting out of that looking i said

[1:32:00] get the seven seals the seven church
[1:32:02] ages you can get it free if you get it

[1:32:34] them is that right when paul say if it's
[1:32:37] still going out if they still pushing

[1:36:49] don't have to be afraid of this gospel
[1:36:51] we was in a meeting last sunday and we
[1:36:53] was there that's why parents you teach
[1:36:55] your children to be reverent

[1:37:07] got there and we was working with the
[1:37:09] message the guide

[1:37:19] to be about seven or eight i looked at
[1:37:21] them and they needed to be saved
[1:37:23] so once they got around there i asked
[1:37:25] them to close their eyes bow their heads
[1:37:28] and they get around there and brother
[1:37:29] steve when they came in they said who
[1:37:31] needed their salvation and they raised
[1:37:34] the hand god granted them thou said
[1:37:36] salvation as we spoke the word we know
[1:37:39] the holy ghost fell on them why by faith
[1:37:41] is that writing and wanting to know
[1:37:44] that i wanted to be sure that god sent
[1:37:47] me there he was a young man he was there
[1:37:50] and he was in prison for 15 years for
[1:37:52] shooting his best friend and i went to

[2:07:08] when the occasion come he'll look he say
[2:07:10] i'm going to catch your head
[2:07:13] did it happen
[2:07:14] did it happen
[2:07:16] [Music]
[2:07:18] you have a powerful
[2:07:20] tool it's a mechanism
[2:07:23] it starts from the heart and he goes to
[2:07:25] the tongue
[2:07:27] and if you know how to use it properly
[2:07:30] you can change everything
[2:07:33] because even god created everything by

[2:08:00] you dead
[2:08:01] somebody already caught it probably
[2:08:05] my what
[2:08:07] why did he start with the heart
[2:08:10] because out of the abundance of the
[2:08:13] the mouth do what
[2:08:15] so the heart must be in abundance
[2:08:19] right and the bible says my heart is
[2:08:22] indicting
[2:08:25] a good mother
[2:08:27] so there is something good
[2:08:29] that is already filling my heart
[2:08:31] and overwhelming my heart
[2:08:35] that's the first that's where it started
[2:08:36] from your heart
[2:08:38] i told somebody i say why do you worry
[2:08:40] about something
[2:08:42] and someone's someone else doesn't
[2:08:46] let me
[2:08:47] help you do you have a few minutes do
[2:08:50] you have a few minutes
[2:08:51] why do you like a toyota
[2:08:55] and you don't like it nissan
[2:08:59] have you ever wonder why
[2:09:00] they can show you all the nissan
[2:09:03] they look good
[2:09:05] but something is in you in you
[2:09:07] doesn't match with the nissan why
[2:09:12] and even if they give you money you're
[2:09:14] not going to buy the nissan you will go
[2:09:16] straight to toyota why
[2:09:19] have you ever thought about it
[2:09:22] have you ever thought about it do you
[2:09:24] know why
[2:09:25] because toyota was in your package
[2:09:31] oh my god
[2:09:35] did you get what i'm saying
[2:09:38] so you were born with toyota in you
[2:09:45] i'm trying to get a simple example so
[2:09:47] you can understand amen you were born
[2:09:50] with it
[2:09:51] but you didn't know
[2:09:53] anybody here
[2:09:54] what you think is you
[2:09:57] that have oh like this toyota is good it
[2:10:00] is not it it's the true you that had
[2:10:02] toyota before the foundation of the
[2:10:05] world
[2:10:08] why have you seen somebody who doesn't
[2:10:10] want to live in the city
[2:10:14] do you know that and you meet somebody
[2:10:16] else who said no no no i cannot be in
[2:10:18] the country i have to be in the city why
[2:10:20] is one loving the city and another one
[2:10:23] doesn't like the
[2:10:26] city everybody here why is one loving it
[2:10:30] and another one said no no no if i want
[2:10:32] to leave i want to go there if i want
[2:10:34] and if you notice at the end toward
[2:10:36] their life down the road you will see
[2:10:38] them living exactly
[2:10:40] where they were saying why
[2:10:42] because you were born with this thing
[2:10:46] when you're born you have a package
[2:10:49] that package will unfold as life goes
[2:10:52] anybody care
[2:10:53] but when it unfold you think it's your
[2:10:56] memory it's not your memo it's not your
[2:10:59] brain
[2:11:00] it is something that was here that is
[2:11:03] it's like a flower that is coming up
[2:11:05] like a seed it's coming up that's why
[2:11:07] brother branham say whatever god leads
[2:11:10] your soul to believe it is yours
[2:11:15] do you know that quote
[2:11:18] you know that quote if you feel like a
[2:11:20] strong desire coming up all the time
[2:11:23] and pushing something it is exactly what
[2:11:26] belongs to you
[2:11:27] you just don't understand because you
[2:11:29] look at the circumstances you say me
[2:11:32] having something like that no and then
[2:11:34] after a while it kind of like bothers
[2:11:36] you you see it coming back up again it's
[2:11:39] just telling you it's me pick me up
[2:11:43] i don't know if you get what i'm saying
[2:11:46] why is orpah going back and roof doesn't
[2:11:49] go back what was in roof that made her
[2:11:52] go
[2:11:53] because there was something in the land
[2:11:55] of judah
[2:11:56] that was pulling for ruth
[2:12:00] and you think it's roof saying where you
[2:12:02] go i will go where are that it was not
[2:12:04] roof saying that it was the program that
[2:12:07] was
[2:12:08] already wired there when it's sun it's
[2:12:10] gone unfolded and before you know it
[2:12:12] it's moving amen
[2:12:15] i hope you caught it
[2:12:18] did you get what i'm saying
[2:12:20] there is no desire that rises up in your
[2:12:23] heart just like that

[2:12:28] about the heart when it comes in your
[2:12:30] heart how many times have you felt
[2:12:32] something in your heart like go to the
[2:12:34] right and you go to the right and
[2:12:35] something happened why did it happen
[2:12:40] it's a package
[2:12:42] if you were born to be an entrepreneur
[2:12:45] you can't help it it's going to push you
[2:12:47] all the way there
[2:12:48] john sharit had an impediment of speech

[2:12:55] can't even speak when he start he goes

[2:14:11] yes you were mighty men of valor already
[2:14:14] in package when times come when you feel
[2:14:17] it pushing up
[2:14:18] seize that opportunity don't doubt it
[2:14:22] just grab it you say
[2:14:23] why this distort god drop on me to do
[2:14:27] something like this
[2:14:28] go knock it you will see before you know
[2:14:31] it you will regret how many staff were
[2:14:33] popping up in your heart everybody here
[2:14:35] let's go to verse one my heart is in
[2:14:38] doubting a good mother
[2:14:41] i speak of the things which i have made
[2:14:43] touching her
[2:14:46] my
[2:14:48] my what
[2:14:50] is the
[2:14:52] offer
[2:14:54] so your tongue is a pen right
[2:14:56] what you say
[2:15:00] what you say verse two that are fairer
[2:15:03] than the children of men
[2:15:05] grace is poor into the lips
[2:15:10] therefore god has blessed thee forever
[2:15:15] what do you do girl that sword upon that
[2:15:18] eye almost mighty
[2:15:20] with that glory and their majesty and in
[2:15:23] their majesty ride
[2:15:25] prosperously
[2:15:27] because of truth and meekness and
[2:15:30] righteousness and that right hand shall
[2:15:33] teach thee terrible things what else are
[2:15:36] you afraid of
[2:15:39] you're not going to speak the word
[2:15:41] over there the devil won't be there
[2:15:45] the devil is here
[2:15:47] brother brother i'm saying we will use
[2:15:49] the higher civilization from there
[2:15:51] it is time to take your tongue
[2:15:54] and use it as a pen and set the mark of
[2:15:57] what you want
[2:16:00] what you say that's what god is waiting
[2:16:02] what you say that's it
[2:16:04] joshua never sat down and said lord
[2:16:06] jesus i'm praying no he just look at the
[2:16:08] sun he said wait a minute god sent me
[2:16:10] here to fight and this thing is going
[2:16:12] down
[2:16:13] he didn't think twice
[2:16:15] one day i would drop down and and and
[2:16:18] demonstrate the difference between the
[2:16:20] brain and the heart
[2:16:22] and you will see amen what happened in
[2:16:25] the heart always bypass the brain
[2:16:29] and it doesn't make sense and don't even
[2:16:31] expect that to make sense because the
[2:16:33] heart doesn't make sense
[2:16:35] the making sense is the brain so when
[2:16:38] you say it doesn't make sense it's the
[2:16:40] brain
[2:16:41] this one doesn't make sense
[2:16:43] this one operates differently
[2:16:47] who would have thought man can fly on a
[2:16:49] jet
[2:16:52] if you tell the people that were in 19 i
[2:16:54] don't know 17 or in the time of jesus
[2:16:56] christ there will be something picking
[2:16:58] up people and then driving with their
[2:17:00] miles and miles uh so many miles an hour
[2:17:03] who's gonna believe you
[2:17:04] but men tap into it and it happened
[2:17:07] amen so now if they tell you today you
[2:17:09] can travel like a thought look at what
[2:17:11] your brain is saying right now
[2:17:13] you you just heard your brain right
[2:17:15] saying no no no no this cannot happen
[2:17:17] but jesus crossed it
[2:17:21] feel it baptized somebody and they took
[2:17:23] him and put him in another city look at
[2:17:25] what your brain is doing right now
[2:17:27] as soon as i say that your brain is
[2:17:29] saying no no no no no no it cannot show
[2:17:31] me i'm like this going up and everything
[2:17:34] it's not going to happen that's exactly
[2:17:36] what it'd be faith always bypass the
[2:17:38] brain
[2:17:40] it's too complete total different
[2:17:42] channel
[2:17:44] amen don't wait for faith to make sense
[2:17:48] faith have only one sense it's called
[2:17:50] the sixth sense
[2:17:51] that's it he doesn't explain things the
[2:17:53] correct way you just believe how do you
[2:17:56] know it's going to happen i don't know
[2:17:59] just i feel like it's going to happen
[2:18:01] how i don't know
[2:18:05] oh my god
[2:18:07] may lord help us if we got time on this
[2:18:10] world we will sit down and show you what
[2:18:12] because when since your childhood
[2:18:15] the way the civilization is wired we
[2:18:17] were trained to train our brain more
[2:18:21] that's why we send children to school so
[2:18:24] every time you go there it's reasoning
[2:18:26] reasoning reasoning reasoning reasoning
[2:18:28] reasoning you go reasoning reason so
[2:18:30] when you graduate you're a doctor you're
[2:18:32] a phd in other way you are phd in
[2:18:35] reasoning
[2:18:38] when you sit down you analyze everything
[2:18:40] by reasoning no we need to do this then
[2:18:43] we do this then we do it because because
[2:18:45] from the childhood you were trained like
[2:18:47] that
[2:18:48] and the one who reason the better is
[2:18:50] considered considering the society the
[2:18:52] best
[2:18:55] then everybody is what in reasoning that
[2:18:58] is the way we were brought up now when
[2:19:00] faith comes it feels strange because
[2:19:02] faith is a different channel it's
[2:19:05] telling you you believe that you can
[2:19:07] jump here and go outside
[2:19:08] [Laughter]
[2:19:11] reasoning is pulling up because you are
[2:19:12] trained with it that's the problem but
[2:19:14] what god is doing he's breaking
[2:19:16] everything out
[2:19:18] that's why gas price is tight everything
[2:19:20] is tight everything is stuck so you
[2:19:22] begin to sit down
[2:19:24] and until all your options are gone
[2:19:27] god said good
[2:19:30] very good now now all your options are
[2:19:33] gone it looks like it's not gonna happen
[2:19:36] that's when god step in and when it
[2:19:38] happened you don't know how to explain
[2:19:40] it you just have to give a testimony and
[2:19:43] that's it oh no he was so and so who
[2:19:45] came and who signed the paper who sent
[2:19:47] so-and-so
[2:19:49] do you know how many people he refused
[2:19:51] to sign the paper why only you
[2:19:53] you can't explain that that's a
[2:19:55] different channel altogether
[2:19:58] so watch what you're saying
[2:20:00] watch what you're saying
[2:20:02] it's very easy
[2:20:05] you can say something and it happened
[2:20:06] you don't even know somebody told me was
[2:20:09] a testimony sister edie did you have a
[2:20:12] hard neighbor
[2:20:15] she's suffering like this brother john
[2:20:16] knows his story
[2:20:18] until one day she said she started she
[2:20:20] said lord jesus i'm tired of this
[2:20:23] neighbor
[2:20:24] i'm just paraphrasing
[2:20:25] can you send me a sweet old lady that
[2:20:28] can sit here and just taking care of her
[2:20:30] flowers and guess what happened she's
[2:20:32] ready
[2:20:35] after a while the neighbor left house
[2:20:37] empty for a while nobody moving in
[2:20:40] and before you know it somebody said
[2:20:42] sister
[2:20:43] hey you're going to have a good neighbor
[2:20:45] and
[2:20:45] what uh what a new neighbor it's going
[2:20:47] to be an old lady and before she even
[2:20:49] got there they already planted her
[2:20:51] flowers
[2:20:52] did you pray for it
[2:20:55] the jews fasted for it
[2:20:57] why did you say it and it happened where
[2:20:59] did that thought came to be specific
[2:21:02] that an old lady who planted flower and
[2:21:05] it happened like that that doesn't come
[2:21:08] here
[2:21:11] all you have to do spend your time
[2:21:13] meditating
[2:21:15] in a different channel throughout the
[2:21:17] world you're thinking about the lord
[2:21:19] you're thinking about the word and when
[2:21:21] something happened automatically you
[2:21:23] will see something rising up and saying
[2:21:26] exactly what need to be
[2:21:29] spoken at that situation then it's going
[2:21:31] to unlock the problem that's what it is
[2:21:33] it's not complicated
[2:21:37] is it complicated
[2:21:39] so if you're traveling they already told
[2:21:41] you what to do
[2:21:44] amen they already told you what to do
[2:21:47] whoever is traveling
[2:21:49] brother kelly was not with me
[2:21:51] but if you watch this serie of roof you
[2:21:54] will see naturally a lot of stuff there
[2:21:58] we apply it more spiritually but if you
[2:22:01] look you will understand
[2:22:04] ruth never went to israel for marriage
[2:22:11] i hope you're getting what i'm saying
[2:22:13] the purpose of her going to israel was
[2:22:16] not to get married
[2:22:18] because that option was already taken
[2:22:20] off naomi say there is no hope i don't
[2:22:23] have any child i don't have anything
[2:22:25] there's no hope if you follow me just
[2:22:27] know you go in here there's nothing to
[2:22:28] do so what she was pursuing was no
[2:22:31] longer about herself
[2:22:34] everybody okay she was living for naomi
[2:22:39] and brother branham say eternal life is
[2:22:42] living for others
[2:22:44] but here when she pursue eternal life
[2:22:48] as she's going down to the land of judah
[2:22:52] eternal life took care of everything
[2:22:57] did it make sense
[2:22:59] did it make sense ruth never was there
[2:23:01] and say whoa boaz and do everything to
[2:23:04] attract the boas she didn't even know
[2:23:07] she's going to meet boaz
[2:23:10] am i helping somebody
[2:23:12] never go there because you're trying to
[2:23:15] get boas
[2:23:16] boas don't come like that
[2:23:20] did i help somebody
[2:23:22] did i help somebody when you go there
[2:23:24] take your car and put it in neutral
[2:23:28] can i continue oh stop or i will
[2:23:30] continue on sunday
[2:23:33] everybody here
[2:23:35] when you put your car in neutral you
[2:23:38] don't put your foot on the pedal
[2:23:44] i'm letting it soak
[2:23:46] it makes noises
[2:23:51] still in neutral
[2:23:52] because you're becoming loud
[2:23:58] and when you loud you're scaring the
[2:24:00] fishes
[2:24:02] but it's uncovered
[2:24:05] you don't have to be loud
[2:24:07] you don't you have to push something to
[2:24:10] attract somebody
[2:24:12] you're wasting your time you're going to
[2:24:14] attract the wrong guy
[2:24:15] when boaz come he usually doesn't talk
[2:24:19] to you
[2:24:23] did i help somebody
[2:24:25] boaz will talk to the chief reaper first
[2:24:28] to inquire about the young lady that is
[2:24:32] in the field
[2:24:35] everybody okay
[2:24:38] let me leave it for sunday you will
[2:24:40] understand what i'm saying if i will be
[2:24:42] able to tell you on sunday when boaz
[2:24:44] come he would talk to brother john paul
[2:24:47] he said brother john paul how are you
[2:24:48] doing who is
[2:24:51] that lady over there
[2:24:54] then brother john porter will give a
[2:24:56] report
[2:24:57] and say yes this is sister sewing so
[2:25:00] she's a good sister she's a wonderful
[2:25:01] sister thank you then boaz move
[2:25:06] then when you come from the trip you
[2:25:08] bring you go back to naomi at home
[2:25:13] and you tell naomi what happened in the
[2:25:15] trip because naomi will ask you how was
[2:25:17] the trip going
[2:25:20] because naomi understands certain laws
[2:25:22] better than you and naomi will begin to
[2:25:25] decode from the what you're saying don't
[2:25:28] hide anything
[2:25:30] and then she will guide you how to move
[2:25:31] on did you get what i'm saying
[2:25:35] this is a secret talk
[2:25:37] that even on youtube you need to really
[2:25:39] follow to get what i'm saying
[2:25:42] anybody okay so far so don't get there
[2:25:44] and be loud
[2:25:49] did i help you
[2:25:51] don't get there and be like the women
[2:25:53] that was waiting for the men from
[2:25:55] chicago
[2:25:58] everybody
[2:26:00] the one who got married was the one that
[2:26:02] was laboring
[2:26:08] did that help you the one that was
[2:26:10] laboring the roof that was wood laboring
[2:26:12] that's the one that got married
[2:26:14] everybody else that fixed themselves up
[2:26:16] for something there they miss it
[2:26:20] because that man was looking for
[2:26:22] something else for character and the one
[2:26:24] that looked like she was not noticed she
[2:26:26] was so quiet you could not even see her
[2:26:29] you could even be on the room and never
[2:26:32] even notice that she was there
[2:26:34] that's the one that depict
[2:26:37] the louder one
[2:26:38] went home
[2:26:40] zero
[2:26:43] be loud in faith
[2:26:45] not in the mouth
[2:26:47] so don't get there and then

[2:28:30] lord we are approaching you humbly
[2:28:32] tonight
[2:28:33] father thanking you again for your grace
[2:28:36] for your love and for your mercy
[2:28:39] and for everything you have is
[2:28:42] blessing us
[2:28:44] father
[2:28:45] there is no way
[2:28:48] we can go into the rapture without the
[2:28:51] spoken word being manifested through
[2:28:53] your brother
[2:28:56] if everything we are seeing around
[2:28:59] [Music]
[2:29:01] are getting their place
[2:29:03] even the war that we thought was three
[2:29:06] days
[2:29:07] now it's lingering
[2:29:10] preparing the anger
[2:29:12] between the nation's father
[2:29:14] lord we know that something must happen
[2:29:17] also in the brother
[2:29:19] because everything goes together so you
[2:29:22] are working in a mysterious way in your
[2:29:25] brother
[2:29:26] and you are preparing us for the final
[2:29:28] showdown
[2:29:30] before
[2:29:31] we go home
[2:29:33] father i pray that you give up special
[2:29:36] revelation
[2:29:37] that the people realize who they are
[2:29:40] because it's very important
[2:29:43] the way things are rolling
[2:29:45] the way this economy is going
[2:29:48] the way lord father prices are going up
[2:29:52] it is so uncertain
[2:29:54] that a normal brain would have a hard
[2:29:57] time
[2:29:57] [Music]
[2:29:59] to keep up with everything that is going
[2:30:02] father it takes the supernatural realm
[2:30:05] of faith
[2:30:07] to override every pressure
[2:30:10] every depression
[2:30:12] every oppression
[2:30:13] everything that looks like there is no
[2:30:15] hope faith can pierce through all of
[2:30:18] them
[2:30:19] and still keep
[2:30:20] a chin up
[2:30:22] and still smiling in the midst of trial
[2:30:25] and keep progressing knowing lord father
[2:30:27] that you who began the good work
[2:30:30] will finish it until the day of jesus
[2:30:33] christ
[2:30:34] lord may you give strength to those that
[2:30:37] feel discouraged
[2:30:39] those that felt like whatever they were
[2:30:41] they were trying to do didn't work
[2:30:43] father may you give them a revelation to
[2:30:45] understand
[2:30:46] that the project and the plan that you
[2:30:48] have for your children it's always
[2:30:50] better and you know everything and
