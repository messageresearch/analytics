[4:59] one it's real easy it says
[5:12] [Music]
[5:21] that's all it says right there it says
[5:34] goodbye to my pain
[5:48] think of whatever's bothering you in
[5:50] life just say so
[5:54] all your sickness all your diseases
[5:56] whatever it may be say goodbye to
[5:58] my pain and my sorrow for so
[6:01] long so long bye bye one
[6:16] whatever the enemy throws at you to say
[6:28] amen amen
[6:32] that's my testimony this evening is so
[6:35] long bye bye whatever satan throws at me
[6:37] you know
[6:38] we can try to fight him or we can just
[6:40] step aside and watch it go
[6:42] brother branham said when you walk up to
[6:43] that rattlesnake in the road don't try
[6:45] to
[6:45] fight it don't try to deal with it just
[6:47] move around it and that's what i want to
[6:49] do whatever the enemy throws at me i'm
[6:51] just going to step aside
[6:52] just step aside my wife was almost here
[6:55] wasn't almost able to make it this
[6:56] evening but god made a way
[6:58] and we had some issues with some of the
[7:00] words which we didn't have for these
[7:01] first two songs but we should have for
[7:03] the rest no matter what the enemy throws
[7:05] it your way
[7:06] you just step aside you know he doesn't
[7:08] have no
[7:09] power no dominion over this bride over
[7:12] god's people
[7:13] so whatever whatever sickness or
[7:15] struggle or whatever the symptoms are
[7:17] of your life you just ignore it and you
[7:19] just look to the promise in the word
[7:21] we're going to open this service in
[7:22] prayer let's all bow our heads
[7:25] thank you lord for this time that we can
[7:27] come together again
[7:28] lord that i can gather with this group
[7:30] of believers lord

[7:33] building is bride lord and it's such a
[7:35] pleasure
[7:36] to be able to gather with this group
[7:38] lord lord and just
[7:40] for the calling that you've given us to
[7:42] be this bride lord and
[7:43] and to be in this age lord because you
[7:45] had confidence that we would overcome
[7:47] and withstand

[8:19] thank you lord i tell you what i was
[8:22] going to do this next song in honor of
[8:24] brother kelly
[8:25] because i know in two separate services
[8:27] he
[8:28] he sang the chorus of this song so i was
[8:30] going to do it in honor of brother kelly
[8:32] but i don't see him here this evening so
[8:34] i hope he's on live stream because
[8:36] brother kelly this is for you
[8:38] but i really enjoy this song and every
[8:40] time he's saying it i just felt it on my
[8:42] heart to to do with the church and teach
[8:43] the church and i'm sure you've heard it
[8:44] before so we're going to try it this
[8:46] [Music]
[8:52] evening
[8:54] when there was no one around
[8:59] god came and spoke these words to me
[9:05] praise will confuse
[9:09] [Music]
[9:16] times when there was no one around
[9:22] god came and spoke these words to me
[9:27] praise will confuse the enemy
[9:32] so i started singing
[9:36] i started clapping i
[9:39] started dancing people
[9:42] were laughing they knew my problems
[9:47] they knew my pain but i
[9:51] knew god would take them away
[9:55] so i've had my share of
[9:58] ups and downs it's times when
[10:02] there was no one around
[10:07] god came and spoke these words to me
[10:11] he said praise praise will confuse
[10:23] [Music]
[10:29] they knew my problems they
[10:32] knew my pain but i
[10:36] knew god would take them away
[10:40] and that's why i praised
[10:52] he's given me a second chance
[10:57] so come on let's
[11:06] [Music]
[11:09] when things are right and when they're
[11:13] wrong
[11:14] he's given me a second chance
[11:19] so come on
[11:23] if we're gonna do this
[11:28] i started clapping i started dancing
[11:34] people were laughing and they knew my
[11:38] problems
[11:39] and they knew my pain
[11:42] but i knew
[11:53] that's why
[11:58] [Music]
[12:10] amen thank you lord
[12:13] i've been there before i've started
[12:16] clapping i started singing i started
[12:18] dancing
[12:19] and people were looking at me and they
[12:21] might think well he's a pentecostal or
[12:23] he's crazy or whatever they want to
[12:25] think but what it is is when you can tap
[12:27] in and see
[12:28] what god has done for you in your life
[12:31] and what he's called you to and who you
[12:33] are and get a revelation of that
[12:35] i tell you what it's easy to lose
[12:36] control i've always described
[12:38] the holy ghost is described as a fire
[12:41] and when that fire comes over you i like
[12:43] to think that if i was on fire
[12:44] that i'm going to react in a way that's
[12:46] going to be running and dancing
[12:48] and rolling and acting crazy because i'm
[12:50] trying to you know i'm on fire
[12:52] well i think of the holy ghost when it
[12:53] comes over us it should be a fire
[12:56] it should be something that excites you
[12:58] you know it's not based on emotion but
[12:59] that doesn't mean it doesn't come with
[13:01] emotion
[13:02] you know when that holy ghost you hit
[13:03] your thumb you have emotion it hurts
[13:05] but when you get touched with this holy
[13:07] spirit i tell you what it'll do
[13:08] something to you
[13:09] so it's don't be scared to clap don't be
[13:11] scared to to run the aisles to dance
[13:14] i mean brother shane go correct me if
[13:15] i'm wrong but i believe that
[13:17] that's still in church order that you
[13:19] can dance you can run
[13:21] i believe brother branham taught that so
[13:22] don't be scared this evening
[13:25] amen thank you lord
[13:30] thank you lord at this time i think
[13:31] we'll just uh
[13:33] we'll take any testimonies has anybody
[13:36] had a testimony on their heart
[13:38] [Music]
[13:41] no testimony he's brother robert

[14:36] actually my
[14:37] my wife's uncle is in the hospital with
[14:41] i guess they say covid and i i think
[14:43] some other things
[14:44] um and i don't think he's doing very
[14:46] well but we know god no matter how
[14:48] where the situation can go we know god
[14:50] can handle it and turn it around so
[14:52] we just look to him we'll bring that
[14:54] request before the lord i don't know if
[14:56] anybody else has a spoken request on
[14:58] their heart brother kelly
[15:13] amen amen
[15:17] he's still our healer he'll still do it
[15:21] if anybody has an unspoken request on
[15:23] their heart if they could just
[15:24] make it known by the uplifting of the
[15:26] hand and brother caleb
[15:28] it's good to have you back good to see
[15:30] our brother brother caleb let's give him
[15:31] a hand
[15:34] [Applause]
[15:39] i mean god bless your sins amen i'm just
[15:43] happy to be back in the household again
[15:45] um i know a lot of you guys have been
[15:47] praying for me
[15:49] um so i just want you guys to appreciate
[15:51] that and uh
[15:52] god bless you for that and i love you
[15:54] for it i just have a little testimony
[15:57] i was gone boot camp for marine
[16:01] everything was going smooth and then
[16:04] they have to do their own tests on
[16:06] everybody else so when they did a test
[16:08] on me
[16:09] um they found out that i had latent
[16:12] tuberculosis
[16:14] and it's just been laying there and
[16:17] i didn't know it don't know how i got it
[16:20] when i got it
[16:21] but apparently it was somebody else that
[16:24] had it and i've been around with them
[16:25] for too long and
[16:26] so so i had to get pulled off of the
[16:29] training
[16:30] and so it's been a month since
[16:34] they were doing whatever they have to do
[16:36] to try to
[16:37] get me better and back on track
[16:40] but they couldn't figure out do i have
[16:44] what they say i have but it's unusual
[16:46] because
[16:47] i was not showing any symptoms and so
[16:51] uh it took longer because they still
[16:53] wanted to know
[16:55] uh why that's the case because every
[16:57] person that they had
[16:59] does have symptoms why are you different
[17:01] than
[17:02] everybody else and so um
[17:05] in me i was just you know one
[17:08] they pulled me out they told me the news
[17:11] you know i was a little uh disappointed
[17:14] because i wanted to
[17:16] you know keep on going in the training
[17:18] but i just sit there and i knew
[17:20] it could you know it could have been
[17:22] worse or um you know
[17:24] so i'm just thankful that god exposed
[17:27] that demon
[17:28] that's been laying there you know who
[17:30] knows why it could have been in the
[17:31] future
[17:32] but guy in his time he you know just
[17:35] exposed it out to me and i was sitting
[17:38] there
[17:40] getting traded treated differently
[17:42] because of the disease or whatever they
[17:44] want to call it
[17:45] and they had me say on the far bench
[17:48] you know so i kind of away from
[17:50] everybody else you know i felt like an
[17:51] outcast
[17:53] and you know i am an outcast
[17:56] amen so i was sitting there and
[18:00] you know i just kind of remember what
[18:02] happened to brother brennam's wife
[18:04] when she got the cancer because of what
[18:06] she did
[18:08] um and remember but when i'm praying and
[18:11] saying you know lord
[18:12] before the doctor even put put her hands
[18:14] on her
[18:15] may you remove that cancer amen and i
[18:18] just
[18:19] lord if you did it for that sister
[18:21] you're the same you can do it for me
[18:24] man they did a bronchoscopy they
[18:27] put something on my lungs get the sample
[18:30] of whatever they saw
[18:32] and they took it out they did all those
[18:35] tests
[18:35] and they tested it for every
[18:39] possible disease they can think of
[18:48] and it was also all of it came back
[18:54] negative
[19:01] [Applause]
[19:06] and so i just kept calm
[19:10] and from there i just knew that
[19:14] my time there was done and they came
[19:17] back and they said
[19:19] everything is coming back negative
[19:22] you're making progress
[19:24] and i was like i was never sick in the
[19:25] first place
[19:27] amen so it's not and i told them
[19:31] it's not what chica i appreciate you
[19:32] guys have to do your job
[19:34] but it's not what you do or in your
[19:36] minds or whatever
[19:38] you study in school it's
[19:41] greater his they live in me that he is
[19:44] in the world
[19:45] amen and i just knew lord my body
[19:48] belongs to you
[19:49] i'm a temple of the holy ghost there's
[19:52] no disease
[19:53] no sickness that can take over and
[19:57] from there i just knew that it was god
[19:58] showing his mighty works to me
[20:01] and i knew my time was done that i had
[20:03] to come home and keep
[20:04] worshiping and saving my god amen
[20:08] what i can just say is that god is not
[20:11] respected of a person
[20:12] a man he'll work in elders
[20:15] in the youth even to the little ones

[45:33] amen i just want to for a little moment
[45:37] tonight i'm
[45:37] just going to take my watch off and uh
[45:41] and uh just put what the lord
[45:44] lay on my heart tonight and we just
[45:47] appreciate the presence of the lord that
[45:49] is here tonight
[45:50] i just want to speak on a little thought
[45:53] before the beginning
[45:55] before the beginning question before
[45:58] the beginning or before there were
[46:01] a world or before he was known
[46:05] as god god had a plan
[46:09] or a purpose god had a plan
[46:13] or a purpose the prophet of god said
[46:17] in the message hear his voice he said
[46:20] and see how god in his great
[46:24] plan just knowing how to make everything
[46:27] every person just
[46:29] exactly to be a certain things because
[46:32] he's going to use
[46:33] them for that purpose
[46:37] can the church say man god
[46:40] is going to use you for a purpose amen
[46:44] now we've seen that the bible let us
[46:47] know that
[46:48] moses wrote uh
[46:51] in genesis moses wrote he says in the
[46:54] beginning
[46:56] god create the heaven
[46:59] and the earth now we realize that
[47:03] it should be all right i just walk
[47:04] around a little bit you know when god
[47:07] uh moses said that god create
[47:10] the heaven and the earth now
[47:13] a bible tells us in the book of john
[47:16] that
[47:17] god is a spirit that's right
[47:20] and and we that worship him must
[47:24] worship him how in
[47:27] spirit and in truth so the only way you
[47:30] can get something tonight
[47:32] you're gonna have to get in the spirit
[47:35] when john was on the isle of patmos
[47:37] 1895-96 for the word of the lord
[47:40] john was caught up in the spirit
[47:44] and sometimes we come to church you know
[47:46] you might have talked through the day of
[47:48] whatever you have went through and
[47:49] sometimes you have to enter
[47:51] into amen into the spirit
[47:54] so moses begin to write a man
[47:58] in the beginning god create
[48:01] the heaven and the earth
[48:05] that's right and moses is going to say
[48:08] that
[48:09] uh the earth was look was without
[48:13] shake form of lord
[48:17] another word when moses wrote that but
[48:20] when john
[48:22] uh the gospel john 1 1 john wrote
[48:25] in the beginning was the word
[48:29] [Applause]
[48:30] and the word was with
[48:33] god and the word
[48:36] was made flesh listen john put an
[48:40] emphasis on that word he want you to
[48:42] notice something now
[48:43] and the word was made flesh
[48:46] and the word dwell among us
[48:49] somebody say man and we see
[48:53] now when paul come along paul talked
[48:56] about
[48:57] ephesians one i think four uh
[49:00] paul talk about in ephesians he talked
[49:02] about
[49:03] uh before the foundation of the world
[49:08] now we was blessed in this generation to
[49:11] have a prophet
[49:12] that went before the beginning
[49:16] before there was a world before
[49:19] he was known as god
[49:25] my how many of you love to just go there
[49:27] tonight
[49:29] before he was known as god
[49:32] now the prophet of god said something
[49:34] here if i could just read this tonight
[49:36] to you
[49:38] amen how the prophet of god he was
[49:40] talking about his daughter
[49:43] now this what he said here
[49:49] he said here he said in the message
[49:52] uh
[49:54] [Music]
[49:57] let's read what he said here he said
[50:00] faith can
[50:01] take it resting place
[50:04] see you've got to have something
[50:07] somewhere
[50:08] that faith can take it resting place and
[50:12] to me
[50:12] i don't know how you feel tonight
[50:15] about it but to me the bible is the
[50:19] infallible the bible
[50:24] this bible this word what you got in
[50:27] your lap
[50:28] on the floor it's infallible
[50:33] if that's right
[50:36] glory to god it is the infallible word
[50:40] of god
[50:41] and i believe that god has watched
[50:44] over his word that there is not
[50:48] one punctuation out of
[50:52] place
[50:54] [Applause]
[50:55] not one common is out of place
[50:59] not one quotation is out of place
[51:02] every period god is allowed it to be
[51:06] there
[51:06] you say wait a minute brother children
[51:08] somebody said where the man did man
[51:10] wrote the bible
[51:10] yes he wrote the bible but according to
[51:13] apostle peter
[51:14] peter said holy mans was inspired
[51:18] and they wrote the word of god
[51:22] so it wasn't man that's right it was the
[51:25] spirit of god
[51:26] that was writing the word of god
[51:31] glory to god in the beginning
[51:34] in the beginning before now
[51:38] right here we see the universe
[51:41] now before there was a galaxy before
[51:43] there was a star
[51:46] before there was anything it was
[51:50] elohim that's right i know you all know
[51:53] that
[51:54] that word elohim is the self-existent
[51:58] one
[51:59] in other words he dwelled all
[52:02] along now a lot of things i'm going to
[52:04] say i can't go back to my nose because
[52:06] it slowed me down
[52:07] i'm just going to preach so elohim
[52:11] the bible the prophet of god said elohim
[52:13] was this great
[52:14] big fountain seven
[52:18] rainbow color somebody say man
[52:22] amen that rainbow color of red and
[52:25] orange and purple and violet
[52:28] it was there for a purpose but that was
[52:31] elohim
[52:32] the self-existent one now elohim
[52:36] amen he dwelled all along now i'm
[52:38] thinking and now i'm thinking
[52:40] before there was a star before there was
[52:43] dust before there was anything before
[52:47] there was
[52:47] air he dwelt
[52:50] all along
[52:54] you know you ought to be happy tonight
[52:57] and
[52:58] elohim amen in his mind
[53:02] he had you
[53:06] yeah sometimes you may feel real bad and
[53:09] down
[53:09] amen but ain't going by how you feel
[53:12] elohim
[53:13] had you in his mind
[53:18] not not only in his mind but you was in
[53:21] the back part of his mind
[53:27] he was in the back part of his mind
[53:29] before there was a star
[53:32] and now let me help you out i want you
[53:34] to tell the devil
[53:35] that elohim had you in his mind
[53:39] before he thought of the devil
[53:43] [Applause]
[53:45] glory to god before he even made the
[53:48] devil
[53:49] you was in his mind
[53:52] now now i know sometimes the devil gives
[53:55] you a hard time
[53:56] and you don't know you coming of going
[53:58] but let me tell you what
[53:59] if elohim had you in his mind
[54:02] back then he got you today
[54:06] you are still in his mind
[54:10] he can't lose you
[54:14] so elohim wanted
[54:18] a man to express himself
[54:22] glory to god how many y'all can't
[54:24] remember now
[54:26] see we was there i know you can't
[54:28] remember with these minds that we have
[54:31] now amen amen because of amnesia
[54:34] amen you can't remember but by the grace
[54:37] of god
[54:38] i believe with all of my heart i was
[54:41] with
[54:41] him before there was a world
[54:45] before there was a star why
[54:48] why you think you are overcoming tonight
[54:50] because you come from god
[54:52] and you're going back to god
[54:56] [Applause]
[54:59] it's impossible it's impossible
[55:02] for you to be deceived
[55:05] you can't be deceit there's no preacher
[55:09] that can deceive you
[55:11] matter of fact we're not falling man
[55:15] we are following the spirit of god
[55:18] the bible said they that are led by the
[55:20] spirit
[55:21] they are what the sons of god
[55:24] [Applause]
[55:26] so i don't let man be my absolute
[55:29] no no no no man it's not my absolute
[55:33] word of god
[55:35] is my absolute tonight the word of god
[55:38] is perfect within itself
[55:40] it's unlimited in his power so
[55:44] i don't have my faith our confidence in
[55:47] a man i got my confidence in the word of
[55:49] god
[55:50] because the prophet of god said when the
[55:53] man leaves the word
[55:54] you do what lincoln god i'm not hearing
[55:58] you now
[55:58] when the man lead the world what do you
[56:01] do
[56:02] then you leave the man you're not
[56:04] falling man
[56:05] but you fall into god
[56:07] [Applause]
[56:11] see the devil is so upset because
[56:14] you come from god you come from god
[56:20] we was out there we was in his mind
[56:25] think about it before there was dust
[56:28] before it was a galaxy we was in his
[56:31] mind
[56:32] and he could never he could never ever
[56:36] take you out of his mind
[56:40] glory to god i know we look at our
[56:42] mistakes and our failure
[56:44] but that don't change what god did now
[56:47] let me tell you what
[56:48] elohim did because
[56:52] he's he's he's i'm not present
[56:55] because he have these attribute in him
[57:00] now what he did uh uh brother brown
[57:03] said the word predestination it's a bad
[57:07] word
[57:08] to use before an untrained audience
[57:12] but i'm feeling capable of using that
[57:14] word tonight
[57:15] so predestination amen it's the full
[57:19] knowledge of god
[57:20] let me tell you what elohim did
[57:23] he saw you and he already
[57:27] know all about you you know why because
[57:30] you were a thought in his mind
[57:34] now tonight last night you know i will
[57:37] think about your pastor brother steve
[57:39] i couldn't imagine brother still i was
[57:41] kind of my mind kind of mad you know
[57:43] his stature and everything but you know
[57:46] i was thinking about him
[57:48] but we was miles and miles away i was in
[57:50] greenville last night
[57:51] i i could i don't think i could talk to
[57:53] him on the phone
[57:54] i just was a thought i was thinking
[57:56] about brother steve but when you was in
[57:58] god's mind
[57:59] you was a thought and god thought were
[58:02] tangible
[58:05] that means god could touch his thoughts
[58:09] y'all hear me god could touch his
[58:12] thoughts that's how real his dogs was
[58:17] so what god did he went ahead of you
[58:21] now a lot of people say you know uh
[58:24] uh let me first of all do you know that
[58:26] god
[58:27] sought every one of us up on a freemore
[58:29] agent
[58:32] do you know that do you know he shot
[58:34] before you life and death
[58:38] now let me tell you what he did now god
[58:41] knew
[58:42] what you was going to accept god knew
[58:44] you was going to come to this
[58:47] you didn't know that but he knew that
[58:50] he went ahead of you and he saw your
[58:53] whole life
[58:55] and you know what he did he saw your
[58:57] whole life
[58:58] and he went and wrote your name on the
[59:01] lamb book of life
[59:04] are you hear me he wrote your name
[59:06] brother gray
[59:07] on the lounge book of life when did he
[59:10] do it
[59:14] somebody said before i don't know why he
[59:17] let the devil beat you up so much amen
[59:19] i've learned now amen because the holy
[59:22] ghost has taught me
[59:23] i don't care if i'm laying down in the
[59:26] mud i'm still a son of god
[59:28] i don't care if i land down on my back
[59:32] i'm still adopted son of god i don't
[59:35] care if i'm
[59:35] broke i'm still rich in christ
[59:39] why because i come from god and i go
[59:43] back to god
[59:46] hallelujah now this is what the prophet
[59:50] of god
[59:51] uh daughter made a statement to him
[59:56] praise god it's in the message
[1:00:00] spoken word the original seed
[1:00:07] praise god now he's saying right here
[1:00:11] he said my daughter back there rebecca
[1:00:14] was saying
[1:00:18] dad in school we can prove
[1:00:22] that there are millions and millions of
[1:00:25] years
[1:00:26] this world is old isn't that contrary
[1:00:30] to the bible he said no sir
[1:00:34] i said it isn't well said if there's
[1:00:38] different studies of rocks and formation
[1:00:42] and stacklets and so on and so forth
[1:00:45] doesn't that prove the the dripping
[1:00:48] of millions of years and god
[1:00:51] said he made the heaven and the earth
[1:00:54] in one 24 hour doesn't that misprove
[1:00:58] the bible he said i said no
[1:01:03] he said if you notice god tell moses
[1:01:06] about the bible he said in the beginning
[1:01:09] god created the heaven and the earth
[1:01:12] period
[1:01:14] that's how long that period
[1:01:17] how long it took that's none of our
[1:01:20] business
[1:01:22] then he goes on ahead and began
[1:01:25] to bring in his time of putting
[1:01:28] seeds in the earth but in the beginning
[1:01:31] might have been hundreds of billions of
[1:01:34] years
[1:01:36] of time but he created the heaven and
[1:01:40] the earth
[1:01:41] period that sells that that's the first
[1:01:44] step
[1:01:45] see he make no mistake how many thank
[1:01:48] god
[1:01:49] see there's one thing about man
[1:01:52] about scientists
[1:01:55] science could say one thing and down the
[1:01:58] road
[1:01:59] science could prove fiction and
[1:02:01] dissonance
[1:02:02] but down the road scientists could say
[1:02:05] well i'm sorry i made a mistake
[1:02:09] but god's word
[1:02:12] once you're saved you're saved
[1:02:17] you have been redeemed you have been
[1:02:19] redeemed
[1:02:21] well the prophet of god said some years
[1:02:24] ago
[1:02:25] he said
[1:02:29] he said what if we took 40 different
[1:02:32] scientists from 1600
[1:02:34] years apart and see what we come up with
[1:02:38] a friend a french scientist 300 years
[1:02:42] ago
[1:02:42] proved by science by rolling the ball
[1:02:46] at a terrific speed uh was
[1:02:49] uh obtained uh 30 miles an hour
[1:02:52] the object would leave the earth and
[1:02:55] fall
[1:02:56] oh do you think scientists will ever
[1:02:58] refer
[1:02:59] back to that you see see
[1:03:02] scientists will change that why because
[1:03:05] we got
[1:03:06] cars out there that can go 100 miles per
[1:03:09] hour
[1:03:09] we don't leave off the earth but see how
[1:03:12] science
[1:03:13] say one thing and they have to change
[1:03:16] but when god's saying there's going to
[1:03:18] be a rapture
[1:03:21] there's going to be a rapture when when
[1:03:24] the word of god says
[1:03:25] that you all overcome us you are
[1:03:32] i tell you how many take god's word

[1:20:25] appeared
[1:20:27] and the earth was without form
[1:20:30] and void and darkness
[1:20:34] was upon the face of the deep and the
[1:20:37] spirit of god
[1:20:39] moved upon the face of
[1:20:42] the waters now look at verse three now

[1:24:53] and they that worship him what must
[1:24:55] worship him
