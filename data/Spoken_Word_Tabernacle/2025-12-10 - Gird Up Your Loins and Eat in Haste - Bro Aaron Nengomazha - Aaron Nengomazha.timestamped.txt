[56:22] testimony because she can't stand before
[56:24] the people too long. But I know there is
[56:26] more detail to that testimony. God is

[57:33] &gt;&gt; But there are procedure that are very
[57:35] simple.
[57:37] They take maybe 15 minutes.
[57:40] But if you look at the money, you will
[57:43] be amazed. What
[57:46] &gt;&gt; have I said something wrong?
[57:47] &gt;&gt; Have I said something wrong? You can see
[57:49] 47 patient and make a certain amount and
[57:52] you can see five patient and make three
[57:54] times the number that you see in 47
[57:57] patient. So what do you want?
[58:00] What do you want? Do you want me to come
[58:03] and be worn up at home and tired and
[58:06] then we're going to get into a prayer
[58:08] service? I say to the Lord, I say,
[58:10] "Father, look, this schedule is empty
[58:12] here. Can you put me an easy one?" That
[58:14] is like before you know it,
[58:19] ch
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, it looks like you buy you it looks
[58:30] like you guys love suffering.
[58:34] You work with 10 people
[58:36] &gt;&gt; and you make $5,000 and they bring you
[58:39] one person with $5,000. What do you
[58:41] want?
[58:43] &gt;&gt; It's easy.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Easy. And it looks like you playing
[58:46] games. Ch.
[58:50] Next. Next one.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; And you go home, you're happy. God is
[58:53] able.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Do you think that Israel was fighting
[58:57] with their might?
[58:59] &gt;&gt; Go search. GO READ THE BIBLE. God was in
[59:02] the middle of the fight.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; He's weakening the enemy, removing tire
[59:09] from their the their the chariot and
[59:12] then all kind of it was God that was
[59:14] fighting. All Israel have to do is just
[59:17] slay the enemy because the enemy is
[59:19] already terrified.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Rahab say everybody here is already
[59:25] trembling. Who who made the wall fall?
[59:29] &gt;&gt; The wall of Jericho. Who made them fall?
[59:31] Did Israel have to stand from the
[59:33] morning with a hammer? No. The war fall
[59:37] by the falling of the wall. How many
[59:38] people already died
[59:41] &gt;&gt; just by the wall falling? So do you
[59:43] think when Israel was entering the
[59:45] people have even the courage
[59:47] &gt;&gt; to even stand when you seen all the wall
[59:50] crumbling down? Do you have the It was
[59:52] God doing that. God even told Israel,
[59:55] I'm going to send your fear before you.
[59:58] The fear of Israel was going before
[1:00:00] terrorizing the enemy. God is able to
[1:00:04] make things easier for you.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; God took a piece of wood and put it in
[1:00:10] the water. And the piece of wood pulled
[1:00:13] the uh the metal. The axe, it's written
[1:00:15] in your Bible. The axe got into the
[1:00:17] water and they took a piece of metal and
[1:00:20] they put the I mean wood and the wood
[1:00:22] pulled the metal. Explain me the
[1:00:24] chemistry.
[1:00:26] How can a wood pull the metal?
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; This is the God I serve.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; My friend, it is a hour of logic. I'm
[1:00:35] tired of logic. I'm tired of reasoning.
[1:00:38] Reasoning have brought nothing to my
[1:00:40] life. But faith have done a lot of stuff
[1:00:43] in my life. So, I'm going to stick to
[1:00:45] faith and move on. You can't tell me
[1:00:48] anything. I have several experience of
[1:00:50] the faith of God. I seen God giving me
[1:00:53] $18,000
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; for a day like this.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; It's not a history. I seen it with my
[1:01:00] own eyes.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; I took it to the church treasury, put it
[1:01:05] there in the bank account, write the
[1:01:06] check and say, "Come and get it." Today
[1:01:08] it's a history. That foundation is a
[1:01:10] history.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; It is not in payment. That foundation is
[1:01:14] paid full.
[1:01:21] I'm trying to raise your faith up. I'm
[1:01:24] trying to raise your faith up.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; That foundation was 67 and it's paid
[1:01:29] off. How much is your house?
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; You are too spiritual. Yeah, you are too
[1:01:40] spiritual. That's fine. Uh let's let's
[1:01:42] talk about other things
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; because some of you own mortgages of
[1:01:46] $200,000 or some God is showing you what
[1:01:49] he can do. In other words, your house
[1:01:52] can be paid off.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; A few people continue with your
[1:01:59] mortgage. Not me. Not me.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Not me. I have I have promises in this
[1:02:05] Bible right here.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; I have promises of houses without
[1:02:09] mortgage. It's in this house.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So when I come to church and
[1:02:16] they say praise,
[1:02:19] then I'm going to praise him because God
[1:02:22] has been so good to me.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together? If you happy AND YOU
[1:02:28] LET'S CLAP OUR HAND FOR GOD.
[1:02:35] AMEN.
[1:02:38] We greet you all in the precious name of
[1:02:40] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Both
[1:02:43] visible and invisible audience. Amen.
[1:02:46] When the rapture come, you won't need
[1:02:48] all the faith that you need now. We will
[1:02:51] see Jesus all the time.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; And so if I need to really enjoy my
[1:02:56] faith, I will enjoy it now. I will
[1:02:59] believe for whatever I want to believe.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; You don't have to join me. I can stay
[1:03:04] alone.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; I will still believe it.
[1:03:07] Amen.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is not a story book. This is
[1:03:11] a real book.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; It is things that happened truly.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; And even there are many things that
[1:03:20] happened that were not even written here
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; that Jesus did that were not even
[1:03:24] written here.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; So how much more was done in Israel?
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; So we cannot even be confined to this
[1:03:32] book because what he did was so much.
[1:03:35] That's why we understand the thunders.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. We gave you the definition of
[1:03:44] thunders on Sunday. Very simple.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Very simple from the Bible. Amen.

[1:08:47] are here tonight and it's by grace that
[1:08:49] we'll be able to make it. Lord, some of
[1:08:51] us came from the Congo, some came from
[1:08:53] Zimbabwe and some came from America. As
[1:08:56] you said, some come from the east and
[1:08:58] some come from the west. But we have
[1:09:00] come to dine with the king by the grace
[1:09:02] of God. Uh as poor of old who said, "I
[1:09:06] am what I am by the grace of almighty
[1:09:09] God." Uh and tonight, Father, we are who
[1:09:12] we are by your grace. Uh we are healed
[1:09:15] by your grace. Uh we are thankful by
[1:09:17] your grace. UH WE ARE SO THANKFUL LORD

[1:09:44] No wonder, father, the elders, they laid
[1:09:46] down their crowns before the lamb
[1:09:49] because they knew that worth is the lamb
[1:09:52] uh that was slain. Uh we thank you

[1:10:07] living vessels. Grant it tonight in the
[1:10:10] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:10:11] Christ.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Give God a hand of praise.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; You can do better than that. Give God a
[1:10:22] hand of praise.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:10:27] Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; We greet you all in the name of the Lord
[1:10:34] and Savior Jesus Christ.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:38] uh trusting that uh you're all doing
[1:10:40] fine tonight by the grace of the Lord.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; All right, we have you turn our Bibles
[1:10:45] to the book of Exodus.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Trying to see if I can pull my
[1:10:49] PowerPoint here, but uh I can
[1:10:53] Exodus chapter 12 verse 11.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; If you have it, you can say amen.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Bring your greetings from uh our pastor,
[1:11:05] brother Barry Coffee. Amen. Amen.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Uh bringing you greetings from the
[1:11:09] saints. They send their regards.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; It's always a joy and a privilege to be
[1:11:13] back in the house of the Lord.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; You know, when I pray for an easy job,
[1:11:20] God sends me to Gastonia
[1:11:24] because you are wonderful people to
[1:11:26] preach to.
[1:11:31] However, THERE'S NO KING
[1:11:42] IS THE IS the atmosphere. Amen.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; Exodus 12:1.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "And thus says that thus
[1:11:52] shall you eat it with your loins gded,
[1:11:55] your your shoes on your feet,
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; and your staff in your hand,
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; and you shall eat it in haste.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; It is the Lord's Passover."
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. For I will pass through. And I
[1:12:05] want you to know God is saying, I will
[1:12:08] pass through
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; the land of Egypt this night, and will
[1:12:12] smite all the firstborn of the land of
[1:12:14] Egypt, both men and beasts, and against
[1:12:18] all the gods of Egypt, and I'll execute
[1:12:21] judgment. I am the Lord.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; That's the that is the the the
[1:12:27] signature. If it was Trump, he would
[1:12:29] say, "Thank you for attention to this
[1:12:31] man.
[1:12:34] May may God bless you. You may have your
[1:12:35] seats.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; If God says I am the Lord.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; He's saying this is final.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; There there's no higher authority
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; there. There's nothing anymore that can
[1:12:47] be changed
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; because I am the Lord.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; Uh thank you so much musicians for
[1:12:55] wonderful song service. It's good to see
[1:12:57] sister Yoko singing for the Lord. That
[1:13:00] shows that truly it's a it's a real gift
[1:13:02] of the Lord.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; You know, some people they sing and then
[1:13:06] when they get married they they stop
[1:13:08] singing.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; But if you can sing on this side and on
[1:13:14] that side,
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; that's a real gift of God.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; And tonight we want to talk about uh get
[1:13:23] up your loins and eat in haste.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. And uh for a subtitle, we want
[1:13:28] to talk about the son of the king.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. We realize that it is Christmas
[1:13:33] season, but we we don't celebrate
[1:13:36] Christmas. How many how many knows that?
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; But we celebrate the birth of our Lord.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; And we know based on the Bible that our
[1:13:48] Lord was not born in December.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; That's what that's what the prophet
[1:13:53] teaches us.
[1:13:54] But without getting into the doctrines
[1:13:56] that that's for the pastor, right?
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; But being that we are in Christmas
[1:13:59] season, we have to talk about it
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; because brother Brham would preach
[1:14:04] different sermons
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; around Christmas time.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; If you want to go home and search, you
[1:14:09] can find many different wonderful
[1:14:11] sermons.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Because you know the world will
[1:14:14] commercialize anything.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; The world will commercialize Mother's
[1:14:18] Day.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; The world will commercialize Easter. The
[1:14:22] world will commercialize Thanksgiving.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; The world will commercialize Christmas.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; The world will commercialize anything
[1:14:28] they can commercialize.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; But our job, our job is not to go after
[1:14:33] the commercial side.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Our job is to stay with the Bible.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; And I've learned early on in the
[1:14:42] ministry that when you visit, never
[1:14:44] teach about Christmas.
[1:14:49] Always leave that for the pastor. Amen.
[1:14:51] Yes sir.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; But from the scripture that we read,
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; the Bible says when you eat the
[1:14:57] Passover,
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; it talks about three things.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; You know, if I wish I had something to
[1:15:03] illustrate by time, I could have brought
[1:15:05] something, but um
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. The Bible says,
[1:15:13] "You shall eat it with your loins ged
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; and your shoes in your feet." That's the
[1:15:19] second thing. and your staff in your
[1:15:21] hand.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; And you shall eat it in haste.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; For it is the Lord's Passover.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; And tonight, by the grace of God, we
[1:15:28] want to talk about the attitude of an
[1:15:31] exodus.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; you know, you know, getting up your
[1:15:34] loins.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; That is how you eat the Passover lamb.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; That is how you It's not sometimes what
[1:15:42] you are eating.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's how you are eating it.
[1:15:46] Sometimes it's not what you do but it's
[1:15:49] about how you do it.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Many times you know we feel justified by
[1:15:54] doing what we are doing.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; But sometimes God is more interested in
[1:15:59] how we are doing what we are doing.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the L the name of the Lord.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; You know sometimes people like to say no
[1:16:06] why why do you condemn me? I've done
[1:16:08] that. You know you can you could say
[1:16:11] good morning. You say, "Yeah, I've said
[1:16:13] good morning to you, but how you say it
[1:16:16] tells me what you mean."
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; You can you can tell someone I love you,
[1:16:21] but how you say it will tell me whether
[1:16:24] you mean it or not.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; You can call someone sweetheart.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; But how you say it
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; has different meanings. I can come to
[1:16:42] you and say, "Oh, brother Aaron, I do
[1:16:44] everything right. I say good morning. I
[1:16:46] make a meal." But how you do it makes a
[1:16:49] difference.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; So we could say that we're in the third
[1:16:52] exodus, but we may not be in an exodus
[1:16:56] based on our attitude.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Because sometimes God does not look at
[1:17:01] what we are doing.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; GOD LOOKS AT HOW WE ARE DOING IT. And
[1:17:05] God is very interested in HOW WE ARE
[1:17:08] DOING something
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; because the Bible says that God judges
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; the intents OF THE HEART.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; GOD DOES not judge what you're doing. He
[1:17:18] judges your intention.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because one time there was a woman
[1:17:24] who was anointing the feet of Jesus.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; And Judah said, "If this could have been
[1:17:29] sold, we could have given the money to
[1:17:31] the poor." That was a wonderful
[1:17:34] statement but the intention was not
[1:17:36] correct.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. SO GOD DOES NOT JUDGE YOUR
[1:17:42] WORDS. He judges your intentions.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; So legalism gives you a covering
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; but revelation gives you the right
[1:17:55] intent
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; because legalism is based on
[1:17:59] legislation.
[1:18:00] But revelation is based on love.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Revelation is based on the right intent.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Legalism is about crossing the the the
[1:18:12] tees and dotting the eyes.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; You know, I've done this. I've done
[1:18:16] this. Like the Pharisees, they would pay
[1:18:18] the tithes of OF OF OF SPICES.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said to this is it's okay for
[1:18:24] you to do this. BUT WHY ARE YOU ALSO
[1:18:26] IGNORING THIS? is because their
[1:18:29] intention was not right.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says every each man's
[1:18:35] every man's way is right in his own
[1:18:37] eyes.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; But every man has to prove his own way
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; if he's in the right way. Amen.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; So So the THE THE THE FIRST EXODUS, God
[1:18:48] tells them what to do and how to do it.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; In the second exodus is the same thing.
[1:18:55] In the third exodus, God has told us
[1:18:57] what to do. He has ALSO TOLD US HOW TO
[1:19:00] DO IT.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; AND MANY times the how part is not
[1:19:04] explicitly stated.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; The how part is in between the lines.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; The how part sometimes is not explicitly
[1:19:14] given.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; But God is interested in how we are
[1:19:20] doing things.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; So when you eat the Passover lamb, Amen.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; The Bible says you don't eat sitting
[1:19:26] down.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; It says you should eat it with your
[1:19:29] loins girded up,
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; with your stuff in your hand.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Now, we'll come
[1:19:35] back to this. Let's read another
[1:19:37] scripture.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Hold this thought. We'll come back to
[1:19:40] it.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Now, if we go to John chapter 13:3, the
[1:19:43] Bible says, "Jesus,
[1:19:46] knowing that the father had given him
[1:19:48] all things in his hand,
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand to to see
[1:19:52] something here."
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Jesus had a perfect revelation
[1:19:57] of who he was. And having a perfect
[1:20:00] revelation, the Bible says that he knew
[1:20:02] that the father had given HIM ALL
[1:20:05] THINGS.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; YES, my brother.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that he was that he was
[1:20:09] come from God and he went from God.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; So he knew where he was coming from. He
[1:20:14] knew where he was going and he knew what
[1:20:17] he had.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. SO HE HAD A PERFECT
[1:20:21] REVELATION THAT HE WAS THE son of God.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; HE HAD A PERFECT REVELATION THAT HE WAS
[1:20:27] THE SON OF THE KING.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; HE HAD A PERFECT REVELATION THAT HE WAS
[1:20:31] THE KING OF KINGS.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; BUT WITH THIS PERFECT REVELATION,
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; what does he do? The Bible says he
[1:20:38] riseth from the supper
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; and laid aside his garments and took a
[1:20:43] towel and ged himself and and that he
[1:20:47] poured water in a basin and began to
[1:20:50] wash the disciples feet
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; and to to wipe them with a tower
[1:20:54] wherewith he was ged.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; SO BECAUSE OF PERFECT REVELATION,
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Jesus knew who he was. Amen.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; If I knew I was a king, I would build a
[1:21:06] golden house. IF I KNEW I was a king, I
[1:21:09] would find a thousand servants. If I
[1:21:12] knew I was a king and opposed all
[1:21:14] things, I WOULD FIND 10,000 CHARIOTS.
[1:21:17] BUT JESUS,
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; KNOWING THAT HE WAS A KING OF KINGSH AND
[1:21:21] THE LORD OF LORDS, HE HUMBLED HIMSELF.
[1:21:28] PERFECT REVELATION
[1:21:31] LEADS YOU TO SERVICE.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; PERFECT REVELATION LEADS YOU TO
[1:21:35] HUMILITY.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; PERFECT REVELATION LEADS YOU TO HELP
[1:21:39] YOUR BROTHER. PERFECT REVELATION HELPS
[1:21:43] YOU TO HELP YOUR SISTER.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; If you KNOW WHO YOU ARE AS A HUSBAND,
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; it's not a problem for you to help your
[1:21:55] wife. IF YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE AS A WIFE,
[1:21:58] IT'S NOT A PROBLEM FOR you to help your
[1:22:00] HUSBAND BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE,
[1:22:02] WHERE YOU ARE COMING FROM, WHERE YOU ARE
[1:22:04] GOING, AND WHAT YOU HAVE.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; BUT IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE,
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; you have something called insecurity.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; And when you have insecurity,
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; YOU BECOME A THORN in the flesh.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BUT JESUS WAS SECURE.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE KNEW WHO HE WAS. THAT'S
[1:22:30] WHY YOU YOU WOULD sing a song, blessed
[1:22:33] assurance.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Jesus is mine.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; So when you know who you are,
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; you are not defined by your
[1:22:44] circumstances. WHEN YOU KNOW WHO YOU
[1:22:47] ARE, YOU ARE NOT DEFINED BY WHAT you
[1:22:49] have. WHEN YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE, YOU'RE
[1:22:52] NOT DEFINED BY WHAT YOU DON'T HAVE. WHEN
[1:22:54] YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE, YOU ARE WHO YOU
[1:22:56] ARE BY THE GRACE OF GOD.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Praise be the name of the Lord.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; I am brother Aaron.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; I was born in Zimbabwe in Africa.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; If I wear a suit, I'm still Aaron from
[1:23:18] Africa.
[1:23:19] If I don't wear a suit, I'm still Aaron
[1:23:21] from Africa.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; If I eat five meals, I'm still Aaron. If
[1:23:25] I eat two meals, I'm still Aaron. If you
[1:23:27] know who you are, YOU ARE NOT DEFINED BY
[1:23:30] YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; BUT BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHO WE ARE, WE
[1:23:36] TRY TO FIND THINGS TO DEFINE WHO WE ARE.
[1:23:40] WE TRY TO MAKE SOME TATTOOS UPON OUR
[1:23:42] BODIES TO IDENTIFY WHO WE ARE
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHO WE ARE.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; WE TRY TO FIND LABELS
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE ARE TRYING TO FIND AN
[1:23:53] IDENTITY.
[1:23:59] Take your time.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; That's why people find they use they
[1:24:05] spend all their life saving
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; to buy a Jordan sneaker.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with Jordans.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; On my birthday, you can get me some
[1:24:15] Jordans.
[1:24:18] But you know what? I'm not defined by
[1:24:20] Jordans.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; I'm not defined by the clothes that I
[1:24:23] wear. I'm not defined by the food that I
[1:24:25] eat. I'M DEFINED BY THE WORD OF GOD. THE
[1:24:29] WORD OF GOD TELLS ME WHO I AM.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; I am not defined by my backgrounds. I'M
[1:24:38] NOT DEFINED BY MY zip code or my
[1:24:40] neighborhood. I AM DEFINED BY THE WORD
[1:24:42] OF GOD.
[1:24:44] I'M TRYING to remove the complex from
[1:24:46] your mind.
[1:24:48] YOU ARE A SON OF GOD. UH NO MATTER WHAT
[1:24:51] YOU DRIVE, UH YOU ARE A SON OF GOD. NO
[1:24:54] MATTER WHAT YOU HAVE, YOU'RE A SON OF
[1:24:56] GOD. NO MATTER WHAT YOU EAT, YOU'RE A
[1:24:58] SON OF GOD. NO MATTER WHERE YOU DWELL,
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; because if YOU ARE A SON OF GOD, ALL
[1:25:08] THINGS ARE YOURS.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; YOU POSSESS ALL THINGS
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE JESUS
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; WAS the king of kings.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Was the Lord of lords.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Bible says he became poor.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; He was not poor, but he became poor.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; But can I tell you something?
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; He was a poor king.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; He was riding a donkey, but he was still
[1:25:37] the king of kings. HE HAD ONE ROBE, BUT
[1:25:41] HE WAS STILL THE KING OF KINGS. THE
[1:25:43] DONKEY DID NOT CHANGE WHO HE WAS. THE
[1:25:46] ROBE DID NOT CHANGE WHO HE WAS. YOU ARE
[1:25:48] STILL THE KING OF JE THE KING OF THE
[1:25:52] JEWS.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN HE WAS GOING TO JERUSALEM,
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; he borrowed a donkey.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; And they were singing hosana
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; to the king.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Now, as I I want to I want to give a
[1:26:11] caveat.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; As I'm preaching this,
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying I'm not glorifying being
[1:26:16] poor or poverty.
[1:26:18] You heard
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; poor Joseph and rich Joseph.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; So we got that balance. Amen.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; So now let me preach please.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; You have Joseph of Arythea.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; So you have got Joseph the carpenter and
[1:26:34] you have Joseph of Arythea.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. So don't go this extreme or that
[1:26:44] extreme. Let's just enjoy the word of
[1:26:47] God.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; So what you have
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; does not define who you are
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; because that's where depression comes.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; That's where anxiety comes. That's where
[1:26:58] complexes come. You say, you know what,
[1:27:00] I see others going to a vacation. What
[1:27:01] about me? You know what? You can wait
[1:27:03] upon the Lord. And even if you don't go,
[1:27:06] YOU ARE STILL A SON OF GOD.
[1:27:09] Even if you go OR YOU DON'T GO, YOU ARE
[1:27:11] STILL A SON OF GOD. And if you HAVE THAT
[1:27:13] ATTITUDE, THEN YOU CAN PRAISE GOD IN ANY
[1:27:16] SITUATION. BECAUSE YOUR PRAISING GOD IS
[1:27:19] NOT BASED ON WHAT YOU HAVE. IS BASED ON
[1:27:22] YOUR POSITION IN CHRIST JESUS.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; That's how you have a happy life.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; It's because the devil CAN NEVER GIVE
[1:27:36] YOU ANYTHING. AND JESUS WHEN HE WAS
[1:27:39] GOING to the cross he says the prince of
[1:27:41] this world is waiting for me but he has
[1:27:45] got nothing in me.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN COME TO A PLACE WHERE YOU SAY
[1:27:48] THE DEVIL HAS GOT NOTHING IN ME.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; I AM FOR GOD AND GOD IS FOR ME. I COME
[1:27:59] FROM GOD. I GO BACK TO GOD.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; But Lord is here.
[1:28:07] defines people by objects.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; You are not a man
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; unless you have got six packs.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Guess what? I have one peg, but I'm
[1:28:16] still a man. I'M STILL A SON OF GOD. I'M
[1:28:19] STILL A SON OF GOD.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; OH, you're not a man unless you have a
[1:28:30] pickup truck. Guess what?
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; You may have a minivan. You are still A
[1:28:34] SON OF GOD. YOU ARE STILL A SON OF GOD.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; SO I DON'T CARE WHAT I HAVE OR WHAT I
[1:28:47] DON'T HAVE. I AM A SON OF GOD. AND I
[1:28:50] WILL PRAISE HIM ANYHOW. I WILL PRAISE
[1:28:52] HIM ANYHOW. I WILL SHOUT ANYHOW. I WILL
[1:28:55] DANCE ANYHOW. I WILL HOLLER AMEN.
[1:28:58] ANYHOW,
[1:29:00] SIR,
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; brother Bam says, and you know what I've
[1:29:06] noticed in this in my travels, usually
[1:29:08] great men have and and they are great
[1:29:11] men and they are little men.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; I go around where there's great men,
[1:29:15] really great men. And they are great
[1:29:17] men. When I start to lift them, they
[1:29:19] make you think you are the great man.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; They ain't nothing.
[1:29:26] But you take a a little two by4 don't
[1:29:29] know nothing.
[1:29:31] He thinks he's all of it.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; One knows what he have. One knows one
[1:29:38] has got nothing. One has got something.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Can I use an example? Technicians. You
[1:29:46] can take this and delete this part.
[1:29:49] You go to the hood.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; Somebody buys a $2,000 car. They will
[1:29:54] they'll buy all sort of things from
[1:29:55] Amazon. All these grills, all these
[1:29:58] speakers, all these things.
[1:30:02] Someone with a Rolls-Royce,
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; they just wash it with they just wash it
[1:30:06] with water and that's it.
[1:30:11] BUT THE ONE WHO MAKES NOISE IN the hood
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; is a $1,000 car.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; But the Rolls-Royce
[1:30:29] ONE KNOWS WHO HE IS. ONE IS TRYING TO
[1:30:31] compensate for what he don't have.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT CREATES something called
[1:30:39] religion. Because religion is a
[1:30:41] covering.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHEN ADAM LOST HIS POSITION, HE
[1:30:46] FOUND A COVERING.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; AND GOD SAID, "WHY ARE YOU HIDING FROM
[1:30:50] ME?"
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAYS, "LORD, I'm naked." He said,
[1:30:53] "Who told you I'm naked?"
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; SO ADAM WAS TRYING TO FIND A COVERING
[1:30:59] because he was missing something.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; And whenever a man is looking for
[1:31:04] something,
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; he finds a covering.
[1:31:08] Sometimes it's tattoos.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's muscles.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES IT'S HEAVY METAL MUSIC.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; That is a covering FOR SOMETHING THAT IS
[1:31:18] LOST.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Because you're trying to make something.
[1:31:28] You're trying to make up for something
[1:31:29] that you have lost.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; But if you are a son of God,
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; you don't need you don't need to prove
[1:31:35] anything to anyone.
[1:31:38] Don't prove anything to anyone.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; You know who you are.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO, where you come
[1:31:44] from, and where you are going. YOU KNOW
[1:31:46] YOU'RE A SON OF GOD.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; THAT gives you rest.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; He will keep those in perfect peace
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; whose eyes are what are stayed on thee.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; When you know who you are, it gives you
[1:32:02] rest. And the reason why we don't rest
[1:32:05] is because we are trying. We are running
[1:32:08] around. We are like wandering stars.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; But if you are a son of God, you know
[1:32:12] your position.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; And can I tell you something?
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; Jesus,
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; although he was poor,
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; yet he was able to do whatever you
[1:32:22] wanted to do.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; If you're a son of God,
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; there's nothing that can stop you from
[1:32:29] doing everything that God wants you to
[1:32:31] do. Amen.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Jesus went where he wanted to go.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; He ate where he wanted to eat.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; He He would go to where he ever he
[1:32:39] wanted TO GO BECAUSE GUESS WHAT? BECAUSE
[1:32:41] HE was a son of God. Whenever he had to
[1:32:43] go somewhere, God made a way for him.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; God made a way for him. I say God makes
[1:32:49] a way for you. God makes a way for you.
[1:32:52] God makes a way for you tonight.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; SO A SON OF GOD is not governed by the
[1:33:03] principles of the outside.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; He's governed by the principles of the
[1:33:07] word.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; IF GOD WANTS me to go to Samaria, he
[1:33:12] will take me to Samaria.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; By hook or cook, he will take me to
[1:33:16] Samaria.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; If God wants me to go to Mexico, he will
[1:33:19] take ME TO MEXICO.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; GOD PROVIDES FOR ME WHATEVER I HAVE NEED
[1:33:24] OF.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE BIBLE SAYS, "ALL THINGS
[1:33:27] ARE YOURS.
[1:33:35] Glory to God.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Now the first thing I want to say is
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Jesus never lived for himself.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; His life was spent for others.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; That's perfectly eternal life.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; When when you say you you go to church
[1:33:50] and do this thing, that's fine. But when
[1:33:51] you live for yourself, you have an
[1:33:53] eternal life.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Eternal life is living for others.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. So Jesus
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; knowing who he was
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; having a perfect revelation
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; that God had given him all things where
[1:34:07] he came from where he went to wash the
[1:34:10] feet of the disciples.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; So the proof that Jesus Christ was
[1:34:14] ETERNAL SIR
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; WAS THAT HE WENT TO SERVE HIS DISCIPLES
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE ETERNAL LIFE is serving others
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; and this is the key to the blessing OF
[1:34:26] GOD.
[1:34:30] BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Whenever brother Brham would find
[1:34:33] someone who's sick,
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; or someone who is lost,
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; you know what brother would say? He
[1:34:40] would say, if he heals you,
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; do you promise to serve him?
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; If he heals you,
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; sir,
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; would you promise to serve him?
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Because perfect revelation leads you
[1:34:51] into service. That's exactly
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; what that means is that
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; God provides us with everything that we
[1:35:01] need
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; as long as we are able to put whatever
[1:35:05] we have in service of him
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; and this tells me that even if it's your
[1:35:14] job situation
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; if you have got a real desire in your
[1:35:17] heart
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; and you say Lord I want to save you
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; if you can bless me
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; you know it's I I I got in out of
[1:35:24] trouble many times by just negotiating
[1:35:26] with God.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Say, Lord, if you give me this, I'll
[1:35:28] give you that.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; But you have to you have to honor what
[1:35:31] you promise God.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Because God will will take you very
[1:35:34] seriously at your words.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Because God be he gives eternal life
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; and eternal life is a life that is lived
[1:35:45] to other people. Amen.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Now Jesus and the prophet says now
[1:35:49] eternal life is perfectly living for
[1:35:52] others. So when Jesus Christ came upon
[1:35:55] this earth
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; around this I mean not this time around
[1:35:58] the time of Christmas which will be
[1:36:00] April right
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; the Bible says
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; he was born
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; brother brother brother Steph will
[1:36:10] correct you don't worry
[1:36:14] he was born in a manger
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; and being born in a manger the Bible
[1:36:19] says that there was no room for him at
[1:36:21] the
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; in Yes sir.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Now the King of Kings.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; With all his wisdom and all his
[1:36:28] preparation.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; Yet there was no room for him at the
[1:36:32] inn.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; I want you to think about that.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; When Jesus Christ was born
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; there there was no pictures to show on
[1:36:40] Instagram
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; because it was a manure pile.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; In a manger
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; and he was not wrapped in the North
[1:36:49] Carolina hospital baby blanket.
[1:36:52] He was wrapped in a swandling cloth.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; And the people that came
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; to congratulate him.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; The Bible says it was shepherds.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; That's exactly
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; first it was angels.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Then the shepherds came.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; That's why the king of kings came into
[1:37:13] this world.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; AND THE PROPHET SAYS THAT'S WHAT MAKES
[1:37:16] HIM GOD.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; THAT'S
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; WAS THAT HE WAS ABLE TO GO DOWN.
[1:37:21] BECAUSE THE NATURE OF A man is not to go
[1:37:25] down.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; The nature of of a man is to lift
[1:37:27] himself up.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN YOU GO DOWN, YOU ARE SHOWING
[1:37:31] YOURSELF TO BE GOD.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; BUT ONLY GOD CAN DO THAT.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says THAT'S WHAT MADE
[1:37:41] HIM GOD.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE A MAN CANNOT DO THAT.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; I SAY A MAN CANNOT DO THAT.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; IT TAKES GOD TO DO THAT.
[1:37:55] AND HE WAS BORN IN A MANGER OF HAY.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; AND THE SHEPHERDS
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; THEY CAME and they were singing. And the
[1:38:03] prophet says, the angels, they sang the
[1:38:06] first Noah for him.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; And you know the people that came to the
[1:38:10] temple when he was circumcised, when he
[1:38:12] was dedicated,
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; it was Simeon and Anna.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; That's right. These were not people that
[1:38:17] were coming from the borrowers of
[1:38:19] Manhattan.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; IT WAS THE POOR PEOPLE.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; IT WAS the degraded people.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; IT WAS THE OUTCAST OF the society
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; that came to the dedication of Jesus.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; Because he was the KING OF KINGS.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; NOW, WHY did Jesus do that?
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says in the in the in
[1:38:41] the book of Luke, it says, "This shall
[1:38:44] be a sign to you." Yes sir.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; You shall find the baby
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; raped in swaddling cloth.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; So the raping of the swaddling cloth, IT
[1:38:53] WAS ACTUALLY A SIGN that he was the king
[1:38:56] of kings.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; So his birth
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; was a sign.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:07] Because you see
[1:39:09] one of the, you know, you have to
[1:39:11] understand how when God does things,
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; he's not just doing things for sure.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; He was not just trying to prove to the
[1:39:17] world how poor he can be.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; Neither was he trying to glorify
[1:39:20] poverty.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; But he was showing us a sign.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; That he was going to be the king of
[1:39:26] kings.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; By being born in a manger,
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; and guess what the Bible says?
[1:39:34] He was born in a manger. The prophet
[1:39:35] says he had no place to be born.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; And the and the Bible says he had no
[1:39:41] place to lay his head.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; And when he wanted to go to Jerusalem
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; to be received as a king,
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; he had to borrow a donkey.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; That's exactly.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; And he told disciples, you shall find a
[1:39:55] donkey
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; tied upon a tree.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; It says, if they ask you, you shall tell
[1:40:00] them the master has need of it.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. When they came to collect the
[1:40:07] taxes from him,
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; He had nothing
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; in the treasury.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; But he says, "Go to the fish."
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; The treasury had nothing. But he was
[1:40:23] still the king of kings.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; He was still the Lord of lords. And
[1:40:27] being the king of kings and the lord of
[1:40:28] lords, he was able to send people to
[1:40:32] find gold from a fish.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; That was the sign that he was the
[1:40:39] Messiah.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; Because you know what?
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; If we were to do it here upon the earth
[1:40:50] as human beings to prove that this is a
[1:40:53] royal wedding,
[1:40:56] There will be 31 carat
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; decorations
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; to prove that this is a royal wedding or
[1:41:04] this is a royal birth.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; There will be invitations to the
[1:41:08] celebrities. There will be invitations
[1:41:10] to the billionaires and the millionaires
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; to prove that there's been a royal
[1:41:14] birth.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; But Jesus when he was born,
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; he went 100% the opposite.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; Because you know what? Jesus hides
[1:41:25] himself in simplicity.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; But he reveals himself in the same
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; and that's the same way that he has come
[1:41:32] in our day.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; Because you see everything about his
[1:41:37] birth.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; The prophet says he was born in the
[1:41:41] smallest town of the princes of Judah,
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; which was Bethlehem.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; He he went he just he was just going the
[1:41:48] the more little he could go, that's as
[1:41:51] far as he could go. That's right.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; The most literal town of Bethlehem.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; That was where he was born.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; Which was a a a wheat
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; belt.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; And the message when it came to us,
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; It came through a man who was born in
[1:42:05] the hills of Kentucky.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; A hey who was born in the corn belt of
[1:42:10] the United States.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; And that was a sign.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:22] Revelation
[1:42:24] sir
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; does not change who you are
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; but it makes you humble
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; now people have gone to extremes
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; to say no get rid of your houses don't
[1:42:36] drive nice cars that is wrong
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; a true revelation
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; sir
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; you you live in a nice house
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; but you are still humble you still come
[1:42:46] to church you still praise the Lord a
[1:42:49] true revelation you drive a nice car.
[1:42:52] You thank God for a nice car, but you
[1:42:54] still come to church. YOU STILL WORSHIP
[1:42:56] GOD. UH YOU STILL HUG the brothers. Uh
[1:42:59] you still sweep the church. Uh you still
[1:43:01] respect the PEOPLE AROUND YOU. THAT'S a
[1:43:04] true revelation.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; Don't be legalistic and say, you know
[1:43:15] what, I want to BE LIKE JESUS CHRIST.
[1:43:16] AND THEN YOU start walking on foot.
[1:43:19] You become you you you become a voodoo
[1:43:22] person who who send you to Sudan or
[1:43:24] Hayiti sir
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; be a normal person
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; brother wanted to live in the mountains
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; the angel says you are going to be a
[1:43:32] bomb if you do THAT AND YOUR WIFE WILL
[1:43:34] leave you
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; so when we talk about the humility of
[1:43:42] Christ we are talking about WHAT IS
[1:43:45] INSIDE YOUR HEART WHAT IS INSIDE YOUR
[1:43:48] MIND. IT'S NOT THE OUTSIDE, IT'S THE
[1:43:51] INSIDE.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; After you preach like this, people go on
[1:43:57] a tangent and say, "Oh, brother Eron,
[1:44:00] that was a wonderful message. I'm
[1:44:01] selling my pickup truck."
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; Come and sell it to me.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; so what I'm saying is Jesus
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; did not change who he was.
[1:44:16] He was still the king of kings
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; although he was born in a manger.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; So the word identifies who you are.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; So when you know who you are, it doesn't
[1:44:27] matter whether you are in a manger,
[1:44:29] whether you're in A HOTEL, WHETHER
[1:44:31] YOU'RE IN AN APARTMENT, YOU ARE STILL A
[1:44:33] SON OF THE KING.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; That is WHAT YOU ARE AND THAT'S WHAT YOU
[1:44:39] FOCUS ON.
[1:44:44] AND when God lifts you up, you become
[1:44:46] more humble. When God lifts you up, you
[1:44:49] become MORE HUMBLE. WHEN GOD LIFTS YOU
[1:44:50] UP, YOU BECOME MORE HUMBLE.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; HE GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Don't try to be humble. Be humble.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, "Blessed are the
[1:45:04] poor in spirit."
[1:45:09] It's in spirit.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; In spirit.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not having one jacket.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; You are not the Messiah.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; You are who you are by the grace of God.
[1:45:28] Be yourself.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Don't try to live in Nazareth and and
[1:45:31] and and and walk walk with with sandals.
[1:45:34] No, sir.
[1:45:36] Be yourself.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Wear a suit. Come to church.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Take a shower.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Wear put on some lotion.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; The message is not a doomsday cout.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; The message is the life of Jesus Christ.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; But we ARE NOT A DOOMSDAY COUT.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Brother says, "Don't try to be odd
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; with the seventh seal." He says, "Don't
[1:46:02] try to be odd.
[1:46:05] If Jesus is coming tomorrow, just be on
[1:46:07] your post of duty.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; If you are working, he will find you
[1:46:10] working.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; If you in school, HE WILL FIND YOU IN
[1:46:13] SCHOOL.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; Don't try to be strange, to be humble.
[1:46:17] No sir, follow the word.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; You know, it's very hard to balance
[1:46:25] people because
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; they they go to one extreme. always.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; You know how people start to say, you
[1:46:34] know, you know what? I'm not going to
[1:46:35] finish my finish my degree. Guess what?
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Life is going to be very hard for you.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Don't do something unless God tells you
[1:46:44] to do it.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham, you'd say, "I'm going to
[1:46:54] cut my message short because the kids
[1:46:56] are in school." He was preaching the end
[1:46:58] time message but his kids were still
[1:47:01] going to school.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; Where did he preach the message
[1:47:07] leadership?
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; He was teaching I think it was Rebecca's
[1:47:11] graduation class.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; Imagine the prophet's son daughter was
[1:47:15] graduating and he was he was teaching
[1:47:16] leadership.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; So when you hear about why Bethlehem
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; why it had to be shepherds
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; don't take it with a canal attitude.
[1:47:27] take it with a spiritual revelation
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; to say, you know what? I have all of
[1:47:32] these things, but my Lord did not have
[1:47:34] any of this. I give God the praise.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; Even if I have all these things, I want
[1:47:39] to serve MY GOD WITH ALL MY HEART, WITH
[1:47:42] ALL MY STRENGTH, WITH ALL MY SOUL.
[1:47:54] What the Bible says, for my yoke is
[1:47:56] easy.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; And my burden is light.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; So Jesus has a yokeh
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; and Jesus has a burden.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; But his yoke is easy, but his burden is
[1:48:06] light.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. Now, so Jesus when he
[1:48:09] came upon the earth,
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; he was not yolked to anything, but he
[1:48:14] was only yolked to the will of the
[1:48:15] father.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; So that is what we must do
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; is that we are y to the will of the
[1:48:22] father
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; because David said when riches increase
[1:48:26] set not your heart upon them.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; You can have nice things but don't set
[1:48:34] your heart upon those things. Amen.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; WHATEVER YOU HAVE, DON'T SET YOUR HEART
[1:48:38] upon those things. YOUR HEART SHOULD BE
[1:48:40] ON JESUS CHRIST.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; Your heart SHOULD BE UPON JESUS CHRIST
[1:48:45] AND HIS WORD ONLY.
[1:48:51] NOW, SO THE scripture that we read first
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; was that the exodus
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; the people were supposed to g up their
[1:48:59] loins
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; because in the old testament they used
[1:49:01] to wear these long robes
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; but these long robes if you were going
[1:49:04] to work walk a long distance or run
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; you know it's it's very difficult
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; so what do what would people do they
[1:49:11] would pull them and they would you know
[1:49:13] tie them with a belt
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; and that would tell you that somebody is
[1:49:17] ready to move
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; and they would wear their sandals, their
[1:49:20] shoes
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; and they would they would travel with a
[1:49:24] what?
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; With a with a staff.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; So God is telling you
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; when you hear the word of an
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; exorders
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; enjoy the lamp.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; Eat the lamp. But guess what your mind
[1:49:36] should be? I have to move.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; I have to move.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; I have to walk. I have to go. So we are
[1:49:42] eating the message of the hour. But we
[1:49:44] are not eating to stay here upon the
[1:49:46] earth. Our attitude is I have to go to
[1:49:49] the rapture. I have to go to heaven. I
[1:49:52] have to meet Melkisedc. I have to go in
[1:49:55] the rapture.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; So we are eating the lamb.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; We are asking God FOR WONDERFUL THINGS.
[1:50:04] BUT OUR ATTITUDE is not TO LIVE IN THIS
[1:50:07] WORLD. BUT OUR ATTITUDE IS TO LIVE OVER
[1:50:10] YONDER.
[1:50:14] Because Abraham
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; had hundreds of flocks.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; He had hundreds of flocks.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; But guess what? He was a pilgrim. He was
[1:50:24] a stranger because he was looking for a
[1:50:26] city whose milk and whose BUILDER IS
[1:50:29] GOD. AND THE PROPHET SAID WHEN HE MET
[1:50:33] ME, HE KNEW that the CITY WAS CLOSE BY
[1:50:37] BECAUSE HE MET THE KING OF THE CITY.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. AMEN.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; So Abraham
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; Yes sir
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; had thousand flocks
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; but guess what
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; he was moving
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; that's it
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; he was moving
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; it
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; he was moving he was looking FOR A CITY
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; THAT IS OUR attitude in these last days
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; if you build a nice church praise God we
[1:50:59] are still moving
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; if we BUILD A NICE HOUSE PRAISE GOD I'M
[1:51:03] STILL moving if you BUY A NICE CAR
[1:51:05] PRAISE GOD I'M STILL MOVING because our
[1:51:08] attitude is to move out of here.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; Do you want to know
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; where I'm going?
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; I'm going up yonder.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; I'm going up yonder.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; I'm going up yonder.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not going to New York City.
[1:51:40] I'm not going to Los Angeles. I'm not
[1:51:42] going TO SANTA BARBARA. I'M GOING UP
[1:51:44] BEYOND TO BE WITH ME. I'M GOING UP
[1:51:48] BEYOND TO BE WITH JESUS. I'M GOING UP
[1:51:51] BEYOND TO BE WITH THE KING.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; Because Enoch, he lived until he was 65
[1:52:03] years old. But one day he got a
[1:52:06] revelation and he TOOK A STAFF. HE WEAR
[1:52:10] HIS SANDALS AND HE WAS walking uh
[1:52:13] walking uh walking UH WALKING UNTIL ONE
[1:52:16] DAY HE WAS NOT FOUND.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; Because you know what the Bible says?
[1:52:21] Enoch,
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; he had a family.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; Enoch had a wife.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; Enoch had children.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; But guess what? He was building
[1:52:30] pyramids.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; He was building pyramids. Why was he
[1:52:33] building pyramids? It was a revelation
[1:52:36] of what he was seeing. ENOCH WAS SEEING
[1:52:39] THE PYRAMID CITY. ENOCH WAS seeing the
[1:52:41] city of the king.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; But today, people have become so
[1:52:48] complacent.
[1:52:50] People have become so relaxed.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; You know, they eat McDonald's,
[1:52:55] they eat food, they have a, you know, a
[1:52:57] nice house in the seabs, they have a
[1:53:00] minivan and a dog. They live the
[1:53:02] American dream.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; You know what? I'm not looking for the
[1:53:05] American dream.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; I'm not looking for the for for the
[1:53:08] American dream.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; I'm looking for the bride dream.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; I am looking for the bride dream.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; And my mansion is NOT IN CHARLOTTE. I'VE
[1:53:19] GOT A MANSION OVER THE HILLTOP.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; MY MANSION IS ON THE HILLTOP.
[1:53:29] SO YOU SAY, "Brother Aaron, what are you
[1:53:31] saying?"
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; I'm saying, "Whatever I have,
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; I'm not looking at this.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; I'm looking for the city."
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; Whatever man I have in the bank, I'm not
[1:53:44] looking at that. I'm looking for Jesus.
[1:53:47] WHATEVER I'M DRIVING, I'M NOT LOOKING
[1:53:48] FOR THAT. I'M LOOKING FOR JESUS.
[1:53:54] Wise men still seek him. Where are the
[1:53:57] wise men tonight? Uh who are seeking
[1:53:59] Jesus. THE PROPHET SAYS THEY SAW HIS
[1:54:02] STAR IN THE EAST AND THE STAR WAS IN THE
[1:54:04] WEST. WHERE IS THE WEST? The United
[1:54:07] States of America. THAT'S WHEN THE STAR
[1:54:09] of the seventh seal appeared.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; The Exodus,
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; yes, my brother,
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; it's a call to move.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; The Exodus,
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; yes, sir.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; It's a call to walk.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; The Exodus,
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; it's a call to go on a journey.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; And for you to go on a journey,
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; you need to have travel light.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; You need to travel light
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; because you know what? When you go to an
[1:54:44] air airplane, they will give you they
[1:54:48] will give you a limit for the baggage
[1:54:50] that you can you can bring.
[1:54:54] And that limit I don't care if your
[1:54:56] friend works at the airport.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; It is set by international standards of
[1:55:03] aviation.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; And for us to be in the rapture,
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; my brother,
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; we have to lay off some weight.
[1:55:14] It doesn't matter if your pastor is your
[1:55:16] friend.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter if brother Aaron is
[1:55:18] your friend.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; We are on a journey.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; And for us to go on this journey,
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; there is some weight that we have to get
[1:55:26] get rid of.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; That was the life of Jesus Christ.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; He didn't have anything of the devil.
[1:55:41] The Bible says one of the shortest
[1:55:43] verses in the Bible,
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; it says, "Remember Lot's wife
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; cuz you know what?
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; She had many riches in Sodom.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; And her heart was upon them."
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; But Abraham, when Abraham, he had many
[1:55:57] riches,
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; but when God says move,
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; he just move.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; That's the difference.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; Where is your heart tonight?
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; Where is your heart tonight?
[1:56:12] Amen.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; First Peter chapter 1 verse 13. Glory to
[1:56:20] God.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; I've got 15 minutes to go.
[1:56:24] The musicians took their time. I'll take
[1:56:26] my time.
[1:56:28] Peter says, "Wherefore g up the loins of
[1:56:30] your what?"
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; So in the New Testament, the loins are
[1:56:34] no longer the physical loins of, you
[1:56:37] know, is the loins of your what? Yes, my
[1:56:39] brother,
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; be sober
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; and hope to the end
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; for the grace that is to be brought
[1:56:45] before unto you at the revelation of
[1:56:47] Jesus Christ. Because the Bible says for
[1:56:50] the joy that was set before him,
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; he endured the cross.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; So Moses, the Bible says he he he is he,
[1:56:58] you know, he had faith as seeing him
[1:57:00] who's what? Who is invisible? So because
[1:57:03] they were looking forward to the joy
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; that was before them, they were able to
[1:57:07] endure the challenges
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; that they were going through.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; And and and and Peter and Peter here is
[1:57:13] saying that let's g up
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; the loins of our minds.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; What it tells you is that God is not
[1:57:20] saying get rid of, you know, things in
[1:57:21] your life. Don't buy a phone. No, he's
[1:57:23] saying your mind
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; should always be attentive.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; What is God saying?
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. I feel the Lord saying go and
[1:57:32] pray.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; You go in the closet and pray.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; I feel the Lord telling me tonight to
[1:57:38] just lay low. Just maybe switch off my
[1:57:41] phone and spend time with him.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; I feel the Lord leading me to do this.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; That's what God wants.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; It doesn't help God if you sell your
[1:57:52] house and you're still not spiritual. It
[1:57:54] It doesn't even help God at all.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:57:59] Brother Brham says
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; there will be millionaires in hell.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; He says but there will also be many
[1:58:04] pioneers in hell.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; That's a quotation.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; My brother
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; says there will be many peners in heaven
[1:58:15] in hell.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 11:37
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; they were stoned. They were sand were
[1:58:25] tempted were slain with the word of God.
[1:58:27] They wandered about in sheep skins and
[1:58:29] god stings being destitute afflicted
[1:58:31] tormented of whom the world was not
[1:58:34] worth. They wandered in deserts and in
[1:58:37] mountains and in the ds of the earth.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; So these were people that were on the
[1:58:42] move
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; and the church of God should always be
[1:58:46] on the move
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; because remember the prophet types the
[1:58:49] church of God to the vision of Ezekiel.
[1:58:52] He says, "Is the will in the midst of a
[1:58:54] will?"
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; How many knows that?
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; That's the church of the living God.
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; Because the church of the living God is
[1:59:01] not a denominated church.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; We don't dwell like a denomination. We
[1:59:06] move in tense.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; Today we go this direction. Tomorrow God
[1:59:11] says move. Go this direction. When the
[1:59:14] pillar of fire moves, we move with it.
[1:59:17] So the exter attitude is to be ready to
[1:59:20] move.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; When God speaks, be ready to move
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; because you know what? WHEN GOD SPEAKS,
[1:59:25] IT'S DONE.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; There's no need to to wait and to linger
[1:59:29] around. WHEN GOD SPEAKS, IT'S DONE.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Hebrews Hebrews chapter 13.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; Let us therefore go unto the camp
[1:59:43] bearing his reproach. For here have we
[1:59:44] no continuing city, but we seek one to
[1:59:48] come.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; So even if you live in France or in
[1:59:51] America, your attitude should be, you
[1:59:54] know what, I like where I'm staying. I
[1:59:56] love where I'm staying. But guess what?
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; I'm looking for that other city.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; I'm looking for that other city.
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; You may love your president. You may not
[2:00:07] love him. But guess what? I'm looking
[2:00:09] for a day when Jesus Christ comes
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; and he takes over the earth.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; That's it. That's it.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; And as they departed, Jesus began to say
[2:00:23] unto the multitude concerning John,
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; what you went out the to the wilderness
[2:00:27] to see a a reed shaken with the wind.
[2:00:30] But what went he had to see? A man
[2:00:32] clothed in self, and behold, they that
[2:00:34] wear soft clothing are in king's houses.
[2:00:37] But what you went out for to see a
[2:00:39] prophet here I say unto you and more
[2:00:42] than a prophet.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; And the prophet now he and Jesus Christ
[2:00:46] said
[2:00:48] if you can receive it
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; sir
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; this is here
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; Elijah that is supposed to come. In
[2:00:55] other words, if you are able to receive
[2:00:58] such a deep revelation,
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; because you know what it was so simple,
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; he was not wearing king's robes.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; The Bible says his clothes were camel
[2:01:13] skins
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; and he was and he was baptizing in the
[2:01:16] river Jordan.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; You know when you take a camel skin and
[2:01:19] you go where there's water, you know
[2:01:21] what? It stinks pretty bad.
[2:01:24] So you had to have a revelation to go
[2:01:26] where he was.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; Let me skip some things here. We bring
[2:01:37] it to a close.
[2:01:39] Now the prophet says here
[2:01:43] in exposition of the seven churches, now
[2:01:45] the seventh age is a very short age.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; Gathers up into itself for one quick
[2:01:51] work.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; That's right. all the evil of every age
[2:01:53] and all the reality of Pentecost once
[2:01:55] the Philadelphiaian age is about to run
[2:01:57] its course the loudian age quickly comes
[2:02:00] in
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; bringing the tears and the wheat to the
[2:02:03] harvest
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; so the prophet is telling us that the
[2:02:06] loudest church age
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; yes sir
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; it's a very short age
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; that's right
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; now I want to say this you know soberly
[2:02:12] as I close
[2:02:14] 1700 years ago the church f at na
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; you know what happened at na
[2:02:23] was a man called Constantine.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; He brought a church. They were there was
[2:02:29] division in the church
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; because they were debating on the deity
[2:02:33] of Jesus Christ.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; So he brought the first the different
[2:02:38] scholars and they said let's come
[2:02:39] together let's unite
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; and they had to iron out those
[2:02:43] differences and they made a resolution
[2:02:45] and they came up with something called
[2:02:46] the apostles creed.
[2:02:49] It was made at NA
[2:02:51] and that was the beginning of the Roman
[2:02:55] system.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; Because the church and the state they
[2:02:58] united.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; And then many years later there was what
[2:03:03] is called the great schism when the east
[2:03:05] and and the western bishops they split.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:03:09] But recently the pope that came from
[2:03:12] America,
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; what does his first pilgrimage
[2:03:16] since becoming a pope exactly 1700
[2:03:20] anniversary?
[2:03:22] He goes to Na
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; and at Na he takes the bishops of the
[2:03:28] Eastern Orthodox
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; and the Western Orthodox
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; and he stood and on the ruins of Naa
[2:03:37] because the Na was submerged in water
[2:03:40] and you know you can see the symbolism
[2:03:42] of the beast coming out of the water
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; and they prayed the apostles creed
[2:03:48] together and he was preaching unity.
[2:03:52] says we must come together as one.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; It's time for us to unite.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; And if you are spiritual, you ask
[2:03:59] yourself where is Na?
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; Na is in Turkey.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; Turkey is what we call Asia Minor.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; Because the Turkey is the bridge between
[2:04:11] the east and the west. How many knows
[2:04:13] that
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; that the the church began in in
[2:04:18] Jerusalem and and it spread to Asia
[2:04:20] Minor
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; and the and they were fleeing from
[2:04:23] persecution. They went to Turkey.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; They went to a place called Antioch
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; which was the bridge between the east
[2:04:31] and the west.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; And at Antioch, that's when they were
[2:04:34] first called Christians. That's right.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; So in the beginning, there was that
[2:04:39] bridge between the east and the west. So
[2:04:41] we come again to the last days
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; and the prophet says I want to preach on
[2:04:46] the message when the east and the west
[2:04:49] meet
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; and says we have come to that junction
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; sir
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; where nothing has to happen except the
[2:04:56] coming of the lord
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU CAN NO LONGER go any further
[2:05:00] to the west
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; because the further you go you come to
[2:05:04] what red China HE SAYS BECAUSE CHINA IS
[2:05:07] THE OLDEST civilization
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; and he says is because that gospel has
[2:05:12] traveled with civilization. That's
[2:05:15] right.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; And right now, who is making the most
[2:05:18] advanced car, electric cars?
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; China. Who is building the most advanced
[2:05:23] buildings? China. Who has the biggest
[2:05:25] navy right now? China. Who is
[2:05:28] manufacturing everything all over the
[2:05:30] world?
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; China. Because where was why we have
[2:05:33] come back to the east?
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; The highest number of billionaires
[2:05:37] coming up right now is from where? China
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; industrialization right now is in China.
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; You know, we have got we we have we are
[2:05:48] 31 trillion dollars in debt.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; And China just posted a surplus of over
[2:05:53] $1 trillion trade surplus.
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; They've been making surpluses over I
[2:05:58] don't know decades.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; And right now you look at Saudi Arabia,
[2:06:02] all the eastern countries, they are
[2:06:04] flourishing. Right?
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; And you look at the the West, Greece,
[2:06:07] Britain, uh uh Germany, it's problems
[2:06:10] upon problems. Why? Because the gospel
[2:06:13] is now going back to the east
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; to Israel.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; And so is civilization.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; So what is all these things telling you,
[2:06:23] friends? IT'S TELLING YOU IT'S TIME TO
[2:06:25] GO HOME.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; It's time to go home.
[2:06:30] It's time to leave out of here and to GO
[2:06:33] HOME. SO WHATEVER IS HAPPENING, OUR
[2:06:36] minds and our attitude should be Lord
[2:06:38] take us home. Lord take us home. Lord
[2:06:42] take us home. It's time to be in your in
[2:06:45] in a when you are in church. Don't just
[2:06:47] sit and and listen to the word. It's
[2:06:49] time for you to hold your stuff in your
[2:06:51] hand.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; Hold your stuff in your hand
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; and be ready to go. When you look on the
[2:06:56] news, hold your stuff. wear your ski
[2:06:59] sandals and get up your loins because
[2:07:01] it's homegoing time. I SAY IT'S
[2:07:04] HOMEGOING TIME. Uh it's homegoing time.
[2:07:10] I'm going up yonder. Musicians come.
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; This is homegoing time, friends.
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; This is homegoing time, friends.
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; There are many things we can talk about,
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; but everything is showing that the Lord
[2:07:25] is coming.
[2:07:28] Last time when we were here, we told you
[2:07:30] that
[2:07:31] right now,
[2:07:34] research shows that conservatives are
[2:07:37] starting to hate Israel.
[2:07:40] For the first time in many years,
[2:07:43] everyone right now is hating Israel
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; because you know what? Israel has to
[2:07:49] stand alone
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; so that Christ can fight for it from the
[2:07:52] Mount of Olives.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. That's it.
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; When you see,
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; think about the intelligence of Israel.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; For for for many, many days, they
[2:08:02] couldn't find people in the tunnels.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; Friends, that was the hand of God.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; God was doing something to fulfill his
[2:08:11] word. That's exactly right.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; When you see all these things, friends,
[2:08:15] when you see how the world has become
[2:08:18] Sodom
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; and the world has become
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; Gomorrah,
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; when you see pandemics and wars all
[2:08:24] over, you see diseases, you see
[2:08:26] politics, you see many radicals coming
[2:08:30] up, what does it tell you? When you see
[2:08:33] these things, lift up your heads
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; for your redemption is is drawing now.
[2:08:39] Amen.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; Going up yonder.
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; Sister Yogen, take it away.
[2:08:51] If you want to know, If you want to know
[2:08:56] where I'm going, where I'm going where
[2:09:01] I'm going,
[2:09:09] if anybody ask you, if anybody ask you
[2:09:14] where I'm going,
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; where I am going,
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; where I'm going,
[2:09:28] I'm going up beyond.

[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; I'm going up beyond
[2:09:40] to be with my Lord.
[2:09:44] Yeah.
[2:09:46] I'm going up beyond. Going up.
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; I'm going up beyond.
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; Going up beyond.
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; I'm going up beyond
[2:09:58] to be with my love.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; And I can take the pain.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; I can take the pain.
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; The heartache they bring.
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; The heartache they bring. Home but in
[2:10:15] knowing
[2:10:17] I'll soon be gone.
[2:10:21] Oh,
[2:10:22] as God gives me grad.
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; I'm going to run this race
[2:10:31] until I see my savior.
[2:10:40] I'm going in the rapture.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; Going in the rapture.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; I'm going in the rapture.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; Going in the
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; I'm going in the rapture
[2:10:53] to be with my Lord.
[2:10:59] I'm going in the rapture.
[2:11:03] &gt;&gt; I'm going in the rapture. Going in the
[2:11:07] raptor. I'm going in the rapure
[2:11:11] to be with my love.
[2:11:15] Oh,

[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; I can take the pain.
[2:11:21] &gt;&gt; All the heartaches they bring.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; All the heartaches they bring.
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, there's comfort in knowing
[2:11:30] we'll soon be gone.
[2:11:35] As God gives us grace,
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; we're going to run this race
[2:11:44] until we see a savior
[2:11:48] face to face.
[2:11:54] Going up yonder.
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; Going up yonder.
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; I'm going up beyond.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; Going up.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; I'm going up
[2:12:06] to be with my Lord.
[2:12:09] Yeah.
[2:12:11] I'm going up.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; Going up. I'm going up beyond.
[2:12:19] Going up. I'm going up beyond.
[2:12:24] to be with my love.

[2:12:34] I'm going inure.
[2:12:38] I'm going inure
[2:12:42] to be with my Lord.
[2:12:47] We're going in.
[2:12:51] We're going inure.
[2:12:56] We're going in rapure
[2:13:00] to be with our Lord.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:13:08] Amen.
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; Are you ready to go in the rapture?
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; Praise. Praise. Praise. Praise. Praise
[2:13:17] God. Everything that was preached here
[2:13:21] took it all, balance it up together and
[2:13:24] give it to you straight ahead. Amen.
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; No matter which state you are, keep your
[2:13:29] focus. Amen.
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; On your maker. Amen.
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; Remember you plant potato, brother say
[2:13:36] it's like a jubilee time. Whenever this
[2:13:38] the trumpet sound, what do you do?
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; Job where it is and you go. Amen. You
[2:13:44] remember Israel left Egypt with certain
[2:13:46] food that they didn't finish cooking
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; and we describe it that there are
[2:13:51] certain project we won't finish.
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; And we will get to a point where you
[2:13:56] start building something and before you
[2:13:58] know it you leave it there and we go
[2:13:59] when we come back it's a destruction of
[2:14:02] everything. Amen.
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; Be normal. Stay normal. Get your loans g
[2:14:09] up your feet short with uh uh I mean
[2:14:13] shoes and then have your stuff in your
[2:14:16] hand and be ready for the coming of the
[2:14:18] Lord. Whether you in school, whether you
[2:14:20] at work, whether you trying to get
[2:14:22] married or whether you have a big
[2:14:24] project, whatever you want to do, keep
[2:14:26] your focus at the master. Amen.
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; Because God is coming soon and know who
[2:14:33] you are. This is the biggest thing you
[2:14:36] can keep tonight. Amen. Your
[2:14:38] circumstances do not determine who you
[2:14:42] are.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; When you know who you are, it breaks
[2:14:45] that complex and you can live freely and
[2:14:48] express yourself without even being
[2:14:50] afraid of anything. Not waiting to be
[2:14:53] somebody before you can be who you are.
[2:14:55] God built you with a certain nature. Be
[2:14:59] who God built you with and be confident
[2:15:02] knowing that you are a son of God. You
[2:15:05] are a daughter of God and God is
[2:15:07] watching over you. Amen.
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know he was going left and right
[2:15:12] but the time ran out so you need to
[2:15:14] probably pick up again.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Praise the Lord. Let's give
[2:15:20] the Lord a big clap of
[2:15:25] Amen.
[2:15:26] Amen. The subject of the subject of
[2:15:30] Christmas was already dealt with in a
[2:15:33] hotel.
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; It was already dealt here last year in
[2:15:37] details.
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham clearly stated the
[2:15:40] quote. I gave it to you. Brother
[2:15:41] Brandham say it's a worship of devils.
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; You need to be very spiritual to
[2:15:51] understand brother Brham and stay with
[2:15:54] what is on the tape. That's right.
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; I'm repeating that again.
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; Because there is craziness, foolishness
[2:16:00] going around and everything. Hey, you
[2:16:03] already been preach about Christmas and
[2:16:05] everything. Stay focused in the word.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you do Christmas and you put
[2:16:12] Santa and everything, what do you get
[2:16:14] out of it?
[2:16:15] &gt;&gt; Does it bring you closer to God?
[2:16:17] &gt;&gt; So when you put Santa and then tomorrow
[2:16:19] you are closer to God.
[2:16:21] So I'm asking you a question
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; because it looks like in this message
[2:16:26] they don't want to get that lollipop
[2:16:27] out.
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; When you put a light outside like the
[2:16:34] people in in our neighbor here when you
[2:16:36] put those light that do they attract
[2:16:39] angels?
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say you are worshiping
[2:16:43] the devil.
[2:16:45] &gt;&gt; How many courts do you want?
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, brother Brown was telling
[2:16:51] people merry Christmas.
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; Do you know how many times Elisha Elijah
[2:16:56] told Elijah to stay?
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; I'm asking you a question.
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; I know I know I know somebody was trying
[2:17:03] to escape with that. Let me hold it. Do
[2:17:05] you know how many time Elijah told
[2:17:07] Elisha stay? How many coats
[2:17:12] did Elijah have? Elisha have
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; If you ask Elisha, Elisha say I have
[2:17:17] three coats. Elijah told me stay in
[2:17:19] Gilgar.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; So if you come in Jericho, why are you
[2:17:22] staying in Jericho? I have a quote.
[2:17:24] Elijah say in Jericho, you're going to
[2:17:26] miss the rapture.
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; I wish I was on Sunday.
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:33] &gt;&gt; You're going to miss the revelation of
[2:17:35] the rapture.
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; Because brother Brandham say when they
[2:17:38] say when you see me see is a revelation.
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:17:43] &gt;&gt; The revelation of the rapture happened
[2:17:45] after they crossed Jordan. That's when
[2:17:48] the chariot came and pick up Elijah into
[2:17:50] the rapture. But Elijah who was going
[2:17:54] into the rapture was discouraging
[2:17:57] &gt;&gt; Elijah three times. He say stay here. So
[2:18:00] if you ask or why did you go back?
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; She have a quote from Naomi.
[2:18:06] &gt;&gt; She even have a video from Naomi. You
[2:18:09] didn't know about it. Maybe you were not
[2:18:11] born in that time.
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; In that time we were with roof and I
[2:18:16] have the coat. That's the reason why we
[2:18:18] are still living in Moab
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; because Naomi say stay there.
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; But there was something in roof.
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; When Naomi is saying stay there
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; in the eyes of in in the ear of Ruth it
[2:18:32] doesn't mean stay there. It is like hey
[2:18:35] you trying to block ME FROM MY BLESSING.
[2:18:37] I'M NOT GOING TO STAY HERE. I AM GOING
[2:18:40] WITH YOU.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN. You who are following me online,
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; put a Tik Tok, my friend. I'm already
[2:18:50] moving even on Tik Tok and uh and
[2:18:52] Instagram. Put a Tik Tok. You who are
[2:18:54] following me online. How many quotes do
[2:18:56] you need?
[2:18:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham say Merry
[2:19:00] Christmas. Hey, please don't send me
[2:19:01] Merry Christmas. Send it to hell.
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together?
[2:19:07] Brother Brham himself was growing with
[2:19:10] his ministry.
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; Keep this on Tik Tok. Brother Brham was
[2:19:14] growing with his ministry. Brother
[2:19:16] Brham.
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Brother Brham is in 53.
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; Can I have my time?
[2:19:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham is in 1953. Amen. The
[2:19:27] correction come in 1962.
[2:19:29] He's in 53. How can you expect
[2:19:32] Brotherham in 53 to leave the message of
[2:19:35] 62?
[2:19:36] How do you expect the family of brother
[2:19:39] Branam
[2:19:40] &gt;&gt; in 53 to leave what brother Branham
[2:19:43] preached in 62?
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; How do you expect the photograph, the
[2:19:47] picture taken of brother Brham in 53 to
[2:19:51] be like the picture of what he preached
[2:19:53] in 62?
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; What is wrong with people in the
[2:19:56] message? Brother Brham used to stand on
[2:19:59] the pit
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; and brother Brham say Ricky Rick Ricky
[2:20:03] Rick Ricky Rick Ricky Rick Ricky Rick
[2:20:06] and then in 65 if I'm not mistaken God
[2:20:09] come and say don't do that again
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; now my question to you which code do you
[2:20:14] get
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; do you still call people RICKY RICKETTA
[2:20:19] NO YOU NEED TO PROGRESS with the
[2:20:21] revelation brother Brham was talking
[2:20:23] about a CHRISTMAS TREE AMEN BUT LATER ON
[2:20:26] WHAT DID BROTHER, go see the message
[2:20:28] Christianity VERSUS IDOLATRY. A WHOLE
[2:20:31] MESSAGE.
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN. A Jehovah witness will knock you
[2:20:36] with Jeremiah 10 on the ground.
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; It is rather written on the ground.
[2:20:41] JEREMIAH 10. BROTHER BRHAM spoke about
[2:20:43] what else do you want?
[2:20:46] &gt;&gt; But I know one thing.
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; I'm independent. I'm not in clicks. I
[2:20:51] know one thing. Paul say IF AN ANGEL
[2:20:55] COME DOWN from heaven
[2:20:59] &gt;&gt; if a you didn't get me well because a
[2:21:02] pastor standing on the pull pit could be
[2:21:04] also an angel IF A PASTOR COME DOWN FROM
[2:21:08] HEAVEN EVEN IF PAUL HIMSELF
[2:21:11] &gt;&gt; COME DOWN FROM HEAVEN AND PREACH TO YOU
[2:21:14] SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN WHAT he
[2:21:16] preached let him be a curse
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; CHURCH GET YOUR EYES OFF OF PREACHERS,
[2:21:24] GET YOUR EYES OFF OF BIG PREACHERS. KEEP
[2:21:27] YOUR EYES ON THE MESSAGE AND THE KING.

[2:21:38] believer.
[2:21:39] &gt;&gt; I don't know what's wrong with message
[2:21:41] believer.

[2:21:48] marry uh uh an African-American
[2:21:52] and they took brother Brandham coat
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; and they changed the quote and they
[2:21:56] insert something saying brother Branam
[2:21:58] is approving that
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; and they pull a new quote.
[2:22:02] &gt;&gt; You should see how people are jumping on
[2:22:04] it. It looks like A NEW REVELATION.

[2:22:09] quote. It's on YouTube.
[2:22:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Fabricated.
[2:22:12] &gt;&gt; It's on a fabricated code. It's on
[2:22:13] YouTube. It shows what was in the heart
[2:22:16] of the people. They were looking for
[2:22:18] that FOR A LONG TIME.
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE NOT AGREEING with the message.
[2:22:22] After 50, 300 years, what do you do with
[2:22:25] Christmas?
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.

[2:23:04] &gt;&gt; I am built different. I don't depend on
[2:23:07] preachers to give me money to build the
[2:23:10] church. I depend on God.
[2:23:14] If I have to stand alone, I WILL STAND
[2:23:16] ALONE. BUT WHAT I'M TALKING TO THIS
[2:23:19] CHURCH, STAY WITH THE MESSAGE.
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; AND you who want TO WORSHIP CHRISTMAS,
[2:23:24] TAKE THOSE THINGS OUT OF YOUR HOUSE.
[2:23:27] &gt;&gt; You who PUT ALL THE LIGHT ALL AROUND

[2:23:32] HOUSE.
[2:23:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; They are all foolishness on YouTube.
[2:23:39] Amen.
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; People are calling brother Brandham all
[2:23:41] kind of stuff. What are you going to
[2:23:43] believe?
[2:23:44] &gt;&gt; What do you want to believe?
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; Those candy. What do you want to

[2:24:01] AT THIS TIME ALL THE YEAR. YOU CAN'T
[2:24:03] GIVE YOUR SISTER a gift.
[2:24:07] I don't know why it took me like this,
[2:24:09] brother Robert, but I don't have any
[2:24:10] choice.
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; Huh? You don't have a year to give your
[2:24:14] brother to help your brother with a gift
[2:24:16] to buy food only at this time.
[2:24:20] &gt;&gt; I didn't started. Brother Aaron started
[2:24:22] with Christmas. I'm already picking that
[2:24:24] up. Are we together? Are we together? I
[2:24:27] won't preach again in Christmas. That's
[2:24:29] distraction. We keep moving. God is
[2:24:32] taking us to higher revelation
[2:24:35] &gt;&gt; than Christmas. Let's say focus. Let's
[2:24:37] keep moving.
[2:24:38] &gt;&gt; And you have to pick who you listening
[2:24:40] to.
[2:24:41] &gt;&gt; You cannot listening to everything.
[2:24:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:50] &gt;&gt; Oh God, go read the story. Go read the
[2:24:53] message clearly stated. Why do we worry?
[2:24:56] Why every year we have to speak about
[2:24:59] it? How many sermon do you want?
[2:25:01] &gt;&gt; So in Christmas we've got a Christmas
[2:25:03] message. No, I don't have a Christmas
[2:25:05] message. I will continue with what the
[2:25:07] Holy Ghost is saying.
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; I won't preach to you Christmas for
[2:25:10] what?
[2:25:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. For what?
[2:25:15] &gt;&gt; Then tomorrow it's Easter. Then you get
[2:25:17] a rabbit. Do you know a s do do you know
[2:25:19] the the meaning of a rabbit?
[2:25:24] The play boy uh what do you call uh I
[2:25:27] mean logo is a rabbit
[2:25:29] &gt;&gt; AND YOU BRING ANOTHER RABBIT.
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; NO WONDER YOU GOT the spirit of a
[2:25:33] rabbit.
[2:25:37] &gt;&gt; What is wrong?
[2:25:39] &gt;&gt; What is wrong church? What is wrong
[2:25:41] message believer?
[2:25:43] &gt;&gt; Let's stick with the word.
[2:25:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; Watch how you follow brother Brandham.
[2:25:48] Be very careful. Brother Brandham said
[2:25:51] there are things it's in the unveiling
[2:25:52] of God. I'm finishing then I'm going to
[2:25:54] close. Brother Brandham said there are
[2:25:56] things that God speak intentionally
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; to get people out
[2:26:03] &gt;&gt; to weed the crowd.
[2:26:05] &gt;&gt; So there are things that happen. They
[2:26:07] were we were in the old church. We
[2:26:09] thought everybody was message believer
[2:26:11] &gt;&gt; and God allow something to shake all of
[2:26:13] us
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; and then now we know who was believing
[2:26:16] the message and who don't believe the
[2:26:18] message. And God allows certain things
[2:26:20] sometime to come to show the true color
[2:26:23] of people all over the message.
[2:26:27] &gt;&gt; I wonder if they come up with a quote
[2:26:28] they say sister can wear pen. We will
[2:26:30] you will see in the morning. Hallelujah.
[2:26:32] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:26:36] &gt;&gt; You don't even stop and say wait a
[2:26:38] minute brother Brandham cannot
[2:26:39] contradict himself. No sister can wear
[2:26:42] the No, no, no. You So, so, so, so
[2:26:44] somebody was waiting on that.
[2:26:47] Let's stay with what is in the tape.
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; I'm going to say it and I'm going to
[2:26:52] close. If you ate dinner with brother
[2:26:54] Brana, that's between you and brother
[2:26:57] Brana.
[2:26:58] &gt;&gt; If you sleep on the same bed, Brother
[2:26:59] Brana was sleeping, that is between you
[2:27:02] and brother. If you hunted squirrel or
[2:27:05] foul or fishes or whatever, that's
[2:27:07] between you. Whatever discussion you
[2:27:09] have, it's between you and brother. In
[2:27:12] this church,
[2:27:14] &gt;&gt; we read the Bible and we stay with what
[2:27:16] is on the tape in the tape.
[2:27:20] &gt;&gt; PERIOD. WHATEVER YOU HAVE AS A
[2:27:22] TESTIMONY, THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM.
[2:27:24] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I DON'T WANT AFTER 20 years and
[2:27:26] somebody come and say that testimony was
[2:27:28] not true.
[2:27:29] &gt;&gt; Then it's going to be another problem.
[2:27:31] We don't want that. Let's stick with
[2:27:32] what is on the tape. On the tape. Play
[2:27:35] the tape. Play the tape. Read brother
[2:27:38] Brandham and stay with the scripture and
[2:27:40] move forward. Amen.
[2:27:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:44] &gt;&gt; Ah, brother,
[2:27:46] I'm going on beyond.
[2:27:49] God bless you. May God protect you. Uh,
[2:27:52] this uh machine gun, I was trying to
[2:27:54] hold it, but
[2:27:56] brother Aaron pulled the trigger. So, I
[2:27:59] didn't have any choice. He have to come
[2:28:01] out.
[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:04] &gt;&gt; Stay free from there. Spend time with
[2:28:06] your family. Do all your stuff, but
[2:28:08] don't get in those nonsense. Amen.
[2:28:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:11] &gt;&gt; If not, you will be flipping from
[2:28:13] revelation to revelation. We are tired
[2:28:15] of that. We came from a great disaster.
[2:28:18] We don't want to go into another mess of
[2:28:20] staying behind preachers anymore. We
[2:28:23] tired of that. In this church, we don't
[2:28:25] teach you to stay behind me, behind the
[2:28:28] word. Amen. Behind the message of
[2:28:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:28:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; God bless you. I'm going on beyond.
[2:28:36] If you want to know,
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; if you want to know
[2:28:40] &gt;&gt; where I'm going,
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; where I'm going,
[2:28:45] &gt;&gt; where I'm going,
[2:29:00] where I'm going,
[2:29:02] where I'm
[2:29:12] I'm going up your
[2:29:16] I'm going up your
[2:29:22] to be with my Lord
[2:29:29] knowing I'm younger.
[2:29:34] going up your
[2:29:44] I can take the pain. I can take the
[2:29:48] pain. The heartaches free.
[2:29:51] &gt;&gt; The heartaches.
[2:29:53] It's come. But in knowing
[2:29:56] I'll soon be gone.
[2:30:01] God gives me grad.
[2:30:05] &gt;&gt; I run this race
[2:30:09] until I see my savior
[2:30:13] face to face.
[2:30:18] I'm going up beyond.
[2:30:20] &gt;&gt; Going up your
[2:30:22] &gt;&gt; I'm going up beyond.
[2:30:25] &gt;&gt; Going up yonder.
[2:30:26] &gt;&gt; I'm going up beyond.
[2:30:29] to be with my Lord.
