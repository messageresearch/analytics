not a brother in the message but whatever they are believing they really are dedicated to it um it's I I believe it's it's a denomination if you look at them they you would think they're Believers no makeup no earring long dresses but they're not message believers so we sat down and we talked to them and um me and my husband we kind of celled them a little bit he's a police officer so you know that work is very stressful so when we cell them you know sometimes you can give counsel and somebody doesn't take it but they took it to heart and they implemented everything and in the process I told them it just something just just an inspiration dropped in me and I said by this time next year when we come back you'll be having a baby and I believed it when I said that and so every time I think of them I just thank God for giving them a baby so I posted some pictures on WhatsApp for our anniversary and they responded and something just dropped in me and said call make the call so I asked are you available for a call he said yes so I called and I really wanted to ask but I held back and before I could we could talk more he said guess what we wanted to tell you something I said

relax in the presence of the Lord amen show that devil that no matter what you lead I'm already here I'm going to enjoy the word of God and I'm going to enjoy the service of the Lord amen glory to God the Bible says God verse one stands in the congregation of the Mighty God is here this morning he's standing here and he God judges among the gods You Now understand this clearly you might be seated you know what let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we approaching you humbly this morning Father thanking you once again for your grace for your love for your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father this is as far as I can do with the ability you have given me Lord but Lord we are so conscious since your Prophet taught us to master the human element that I'm unable to be able to feed your flock he only take takes the Holy Spirit to come Lord and to be the one Speaking the one hearing the one understanding the one Lord father decoding the one giving the Revelation to your children Lord I pray Lord father that you move us all completely out of the way may you take the service the technology onto their hand may you strengthen your children Lord father and those Lord that have been affected by the weather May you touch them and heal them because they came into that presence Lord father they made the way all the way here despite Lord father the difficulty or the pain in the body but Lord father they know that they come before the great physician and you are still the same yesterday today and forever Lord may you break Lord father every heaviness from the Devil May your children be completely free may you come and speak to us and keep our mind focused into your word be the beginning and the ending of this service in the name of Jesus Christ amen verse six the Bible says I have said this is God talking that ye are Gods amen and all of you are children of the most high the most high when I read scripture like this in my in if I am a child of God I will be screaming amen because because I'm not a child of the devil God is confirming me that I am his child and I should be happy when God say you are my son despite your failure despite everything that you have done God still remember that you are his child amen glory to God so verse six again deal with a Divine report or a Divine record amen amen glory to God this is verse 6 and verse seven is dealing with something else glory to God praise God verse S say but you shall die like men and fall like one of the princes this one is talking about a record of this Earth from our father from our family from all our failure amen this is where we got it this one is a clean one and this is an eternal one amen this one is temporal because one of this day you won't even have a choice of sin amen amen if you thought maybe when you were younger in the world and in your fight somebody cut you up and you have a scar that's it amen there will be a time you won't have that scar glory to God the only one who will keep scar is the Lord Jesus Christ amen because he have to show the Jews those scar but me and you me and you we won't keep any scar there will come a time there won't be any choice of sin because the bride will be without spot or rinkor rinkor is because of sin and because of death that the reason why we are aging but any Chace of sin and death will be completely removed until we'll be spotless amen even if you battle with something on your skin you won't see that anymore no sir God don't want you to remember anything negative Amen in your life amen and the point about this one is God is aware of the two record amen so when the devil come to accuse you it's not a news he's the accuser the accuser because he want to stay right here he want to talk about this record so much but we and the devil we were there at the beginning why doesn't the devil want to talk about what we did in heaven amen amen there was a lot of stuff the sons of God were doing in heaven he doesn't tell at all he always hide about that part he want to talk about what happened here on Earth so it is your responsibility to remind the devil that I got not the record that we need to talk about amen therefore do you remember when we were in heaven and when we were creating and our father was creating and we were shouting for Joy amen and we were singing like the Morning Star do you remember that time do you remember how we kick you out from Heaven amen and we didn't kick you only you he will kick you and all your Devils do you remember how you tried to Ambush the Lord in heaven and I stood by the Lord you know how many I give you that's the reason why we put you down here don't be intimidated by Satan you need to be on offense amen not on defense if you want to tell the story tell the whole story don't hide anything you can talk about me I can also talk about you and I can talk about your future and where you going to end up you will never gain your position in heaven but my position is eternal no matter what you can tell me no matter what you can tell people on this Earth You will never I will never lose my position in heaven but your position there you will never regain it again you lost it forever but man is still there so go ahead and tell it all amen amen we reach a point you need to grow up we reach a point you cannot be tormented by the devil in your mind you need to shut the devil up and tell him you barking at the wrong door you talking to somebody who knows who they are you talking about somebody who have recognized their position somebody who came back to themselves now I understand why you jealous I understand why you don't like me because me and you didn't come from the same family am I'm a different breed you are another breed I am a God that's why you don't like it but I'm sorry it's too late before the foundation of the world God chose me before I have done anything God already elected me and God won't change his mind about me whether you like it or not I am God glory glory to [Applause] God oh [Applause] my you need to learn the tactics of the devil oh you are hungry because you are hungry because you're suffering it means you're not God tell him I know a God that was all so hungry his name is Jesus Christ did hunger change his God hunger is an opportunity for him to display his [Applause] godship tell the when I have a power I need to exercise my power so you give me opportunity to exercise my power when you bring sickness now I can show you that me and my father we can take care of sickness because he is the god that healed me from all sickness you want to experience the power of healing bring it on and I'm I'm going to show you who I am I'm a different bre oh glory amen glory change the way you look at things

have a conversation come on let's have a conversation because I got the seals open I know who you are but you know also who I am that's why you always want to disturb me why don't you disturb the people that are [Applause] because you want to disturb the best [Applause] one are we together brother are we together glory to God amen amen stay strong there is nothing about your life that impresses God God already knew everything when you were hiding even things you never spoke to anyone God already knows about it he didn't make his decision based on that he made his decision on his soul by [Applause] himself hey my friend let's go to Luke 15 amen because this uh this flight is is is is hard hallu Oh Glory to God never walk sad you didn't get me never walk sad because you

My Flesh she shall be called a woman and Adam said therefore man shall leave father and mother and cling to the wife stop did Adam he the mother you see now you need to read the Bible differently did Adam had a mother where did Adam know that man will have a father in a mother who taught him that because he came up from sleep they just woke him up they say wake up look what is here hey he said this is me he said man will live father and mother where did he know that so he already understood that we will be born from our father and mother who taugh him that show me one scripture where God

ah glory to God children of God amen amen amen amen amen amen Luke 15 if you thereare you can say amen amen glory to God verse 10 this story I don't know what we're going to do with it brother John amen verse 11 we read this story for more than two months now and every time we read it's something new now we're flying a B52 keep your seat belt we ready we ready we ready okay verse 11 a certain man had two sons we are clear about these two sons right who's the first one the Elder the Jews Israel and who's the younger one the Gentile amen this is where the Brad comes the Brad is not coming here amen amen amen remember this in Exodus chapter 4 God told Pharaoh he said to Moses he said thou shall say to Pharaoh th sayith the Lord Israel is my son we clear on that one even my firstborn we clear brother Bram say what from the Jews the oldest Elder right there the first chosen of God right through the cross come the blessing back to the gentille to get the Brad it's written right there blessing come through the cross from the Jews to the Gentile rejected they rejected the cross therefore he got the Gentile briad we clear on that one right job to verse 12 the Bible says and the younger of them the one who was born later say to his father father give me the portion of goods that fall to me and he divided to them his living we know that the firstborn according to the law get a double portion you understand this now amen and the second one get a third amen but remember father was still alive we clear everything belonged to the father he was still alive but despite the fact that the father was alive amen the youngest son remove a third yes yes from the father and everything that was left for the father is two3 or a double portion yes amen am he was still the father follow me but he was the portion of the oldest son amen he belongs to the father because he's still alive right but truly he belongs to the Jews amen and the younger one took his portion and finished it up and came back and enter into the two third let me go back again normally when the young son came back there was nothing for him empty but when he came back the father be to uzee the [Music] robe the robe belongs to the old one the ring belongs to the old one the fatted Cal that they have to kill belong to is my Bible different than your Bible so don't start this way it's a B52 my friend so the so whatever the father was using belongs to the oldest son don't worry let me stabilize somebody jump to verse 30 jum jum to verse 31 let me stabilize somebody keep your seat belt my friend you you there amen am flat attendant we already left my friend amen amen prepare for take off you there 37 and he said Son you are ever with who and all that I have is what why did the father say everything that I have is mine because the father already divided the two things amen but because the father is still alive the older son is not entit anything but the younger uses what he has and he goes back again and begin to use what belongs to the other one and the old one is coming angry and the father said the double portion have always been yours but the younger one can tap into the double portion and pull the best robe and pull the ring and pull the shoes and pull the fatted calf and everything that goes with a feast he's utilizing the inheritance of the Jew I I hope we are together are we together are we [Applause] together all right jump to verse uh uh we 12 and the younger of them said to his father father give me the portion of the goods that fell to me and he divided to them his what living so his living was divided so everything that was left belong to the oldest one we clear there now verse 13 and not many days after that after I'm sorry the youngest son gathered all together and took his journey in into what a far country so there there was a separation that was created between the father and the younger son the father and the younger son separate amen amen a separation and this separation was not a closed one it was a big one amen amen in other word it was hard for the Young son to reach daddy that's right the distance between Daddy and the youngest son was so great compared to the oldest son if you really want to get in contact with the father you need to go through the youngest through the oldest son if you go to the youngest son he's so far away from daddy that you cannot get access from there the only people that were close to Jehovah you want to know about God's law you want to know about God's commandment you want to know about the will of God you want to know whatever God is doing in this world brother Bram say you want to even know the time of God you need to look at the jew they the one that are closer to the father we were Gentile far away having Club on back worshiping ad so far [Music] away are we together it's a B52 my friend we are on verse uh 13 13 and not many days after that the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a what a far country remember Ephesians say we were far away from the common wealth of Israel you remember that and we were without God but the God who is rich in Mercy we were alienated from God you remember Ephesian to and the Bible says there he wasted his substance with riotous living and this wasting when we look at that it was withed are you up to date with the sermon sir this wasting was with what harot churches you know this now organizations sir amen denominations amen so the younger one will go through denominations the younger one will go through denominations amen before coming back to the father and in denomination we are wasting the father substance keep following me very good because the energy God gave you is not to worship the devil the gift God gave us is not to make a name on ourself it is not to use God gift so we can be popular so we can be counted among ministers or counted among pastors all counted among singers the gift is to Magnify Him but if you don't pay attention a denominational spirit will make you waste the gift for your own purpose are we together amen are we together amen when you want to do something look at the motives look at the objective that you're trying to do amen if it's to glorify yourself cut it off that's right because you wasting the father's substance that's right but if it's to help his children uhhuh and to bring them to a closer relationship with God then you using the substance of the father correctly amen are we together amen are we together amen praise God watch now verse 14 and when he had spaned all there arose a mighty what famine in that land continue my friend and he began to be in want and he begin to be in want amen and he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country and he sent him into the field to feed water swine and he would uh fent in other word he would gladly desire have filled his belly with the husk that the swan did it amen and no man gave it to him follow me carefully this boy the younger one you're going to see your life my friend in a far away country he had two phases amen there was a phase that he had the substance of the father amen and when the substance of the father was in his hand amen he spend his time with harot are we together amen then when the substance was pent up that's what the Bible say amen there arose when all everything was spent all amen suddenly the famine came it looks like that famine was waiting I'm reading the Bible that famine was wedding sir it looks like famine was there looking in the bank account when money was there fine was quiet when money was there fine was quiet when money was there fine was quiet because if fine comes when money is there money will conquer are we together but this fine waited until everything was spent in other word no more money amen bank account of a draft [Music] negative when that happen suddenly femine kicking so the spending on of all was coupled with famine amen amen so the first phase is the pH of substance are we together the second phase is a phase without substance amen amen and the purpose of this fine was to begin to make him uncomfortable because he was not in a correct country am are we together he was far away from home and he forgot that way he got into it amen completely put him under Amnesia are we together that's the reason why he have to come back to himself because he was under Amnesia completely he forgot who he was amen living with harot and everything so God waited until every potential that he has was depleted amen when the potential was depleted God turned on the famine so the famine for this child is not a curse no [Music] sir if you a child of the devil it a curse the famine for this son the difficulty the hardship the trial yes sir the trouble sir the pressure that was put upon this child was not to destroy him he was the father begin to work on him I hope we are okay now amen amen he was the father that was working on him when famine started it was the beginning of the end [Laughter] if I lost you you raise your hand when famine started it was the beginning amen of the end he was not ready to go home yet he still want to linger he still loves the country but he was the beginning of the end are we together that's why you might be in a church and you comfortable for a time and for a long time you stay comfortable even though you are eating harot [Applause] food ah no problem I never was in a Baptist Church you might be in a message church and you are comfortable for years where no one preaches Doctrine no one preaches even the church ages no one will touch even the seals no one will give you solid food for years you live like a Baptist under a message roof and suddenly Things become uncomfortable it is the father pressurizing you because he want to move you toward a different position because you getting into a critical [Applause] State all of you probably drive cars here yes there is a tank yes and the tank has gasoline yes it when gasoline is there you can do everything you want but they come a time when gasoline begin to get critical you will see a light pop up and tell you you need to go somewhere there amen the light is not to scare you it is Not to cause you problem the light is telling you it is time to go back to the gas station it is time to refill now it is time to change direction if you going somewhere you need to forget about that direction and worry about the car because you going to get stuck somewhere so the pressure that the God bring in your life is to bring you somewhere you have been far away for a long time now God is PR izing everything to begin to pull you toward the right [Applause] direction the Bible says in the Book of Amos Amos chapter 8 verse 11 the Bible say behold what days come the days cometh the day were not there but they will come says who the Lord God that who that I will send who's sending the famine the Lord God so it's not the devil what comes in your life it is the master that gives permission amen but it's not really [Applause] Satan there won't be any trial on your life that has not passed inspection yet the trial of your wife of your life passes inspection and God put a sticker don't worry my friend that I will send what a famine in that land not a famine of what bread not a thirst for what water but of hearing what the words of the Lord so sometime you will feel you will stay in an environment where you feel unsatisfied it looks like whatever is coming up is no longer solid for you it cannot feed your soul anymore you eat but you still hungry it is the father turning the heat [Applause] [Music] on you say I've been in that church for 25 years then God begin to cause problems Hallelujah brother say now we are going to tap that with a spiritual what drought of today now we all know we are very aware that there is a great what a spiritual drought in the land today a great spiritual drought in the land when today how spiritually speaking and you know that he was uh that was predicted by the prophet just before the what second coming of Christ will be there will come a famine in the land and he won't be for bread but of the hearing of what the word of God and that day is is now hearing what the true word of God not just the word but the true word of God now this stops the natural drought with what the spiritual so the fine didn't come by any chance no sir he came for a purpose to make that boy uncomfortable are we together but when he made that boy uncomfortable he didn't think about home that's right amen I'm reading the Bible he tried to find a solution maybe let me play tap at home preach brother then I won't go to any church that's not the purpose tape will always play Home but we need a local church I got quote after quote after quote after quote after quote are we together we will continue to play tape in our cars in our bedroom you remember yesterday at home everywhere we play tape and I don't need anybody to tell me which tape to play the spirit of the Lord will push me to a specific message for my day because God deals with you [Applause] individually I we to together amen are we together amen are we together amen are we together amen this boy you're going to take me into a different exit let me stay where I'm trying to stay amen amen amen you can open what I do I open the database of the message and I look up at the message and suddenly a year will come to me and say 1946 then I will click 1940 I mean 56 then I will see a tons of message and then when I'm scrolling up Suddenly there will be a message that was like maybe let me listen to this ah and what click is different than what brother Charles click because God want him to listen something for him me I need to listen something for myself but when we come we can now Fellowship I was listening to Jubilee this one say I was listening to the church aging this one say I was listening to this day this scripture is fulfilled now we got Fellowship I'm learning for you and you are learning from me and we are all growing [Applause] up are we together are we together are we together now this boy famine came when famine came normally he should have thought like hey I'm in trouble you know what I need to go home ah I need to go back to my father because famine have come but if you notice he didn't want to go this is where people really stay somewhere and try to negotiate they try to work things up they already seen it's not working this boy is not serious with the Lord I don't think think he's going to make a good husband but you trying to work with him cut it off right cut it off you going to be miserable if you enter marriage God already gave you red light cut it off don't try to work on him God was supposed to work on him before he comes to [Applause] me where were you when God was shaping everyone you don't even know how to read your Bible so I'm the one to teach you how to read the Bible sister you going to suffer go back to your pastor learn how to read the Bible First are we together are we together when famine came normally we should have think like hey man is gone amen let me go back to Daddy amen he didn't do that the Bible say what did he do he went and joined to a citizen that's right are we together at the beginning he joined with the harot Amen on the next phase he didn't join with a harot but he join with a citizen amen and when he joined this citizen this citizen was an owner of fields that's right let's read together the Bible says in verse uh 15 and he went and did what joined himself to who a citizen of that country a citizen of which country that country he doesn't want to go home no he still want to linger over there he got some connection now yeah amen of the citizen of that country amen and and he sent him into what his Fields You See Fields plural to do what feed swine so he got a job of feeding swine pigs are we together all right job to verse 16 and he would what Fame he would gladly he would desire have filled his water belly with the what husks that the swine did eat eat stop what was the swan eating H right brother John amen he moved from Harlot Follow Me Now harlots were denomination are we together which were churches amen but those hot were for that country do you follow me when famine comes it was the Beginning of the End Amen in the beginning of the end he didn't go home he joined with a citizen and that citizen turned him to a worker are you following me are we are you following me so the citizen was the boss living good but the one he was boss of were trying to eat husks William Marion Branham brother Branham says in the exposition of the seven Church ages in the Philadelphian church he says the clergy lived in luxury amen mhm while the poor Church fed on h of what [Applause] abuse I didn't write the Bible I didn't write the message of brother Bram one thing that I know the Bible and the message are perfectly in order they are one the clergy the citizen of the country the clergy have i l you no sir the clergy the citizen of the country live in luxury when the church the one who came to join the church is living on husks and brother Bram say the husks of [Music] abuse a preacher sleeping with women in the churches no problem in this message and not one age did any different each bound itself to what organization and put the government upon man and commit the church to that what government they let the people do what rise up and they were brutally house suppress they don't want the people to be free when the people try to rise up and say something they inflict them and push them down you stay there amen every denomination has the same spirit so when a church is abused in this message by a pastor who's taking advantage of people in the church that's a [Applause] denomination Pastor should respect women and young girls in the church we should not even have a problem or Pastor having Affairs in the church but there is abuse that went on into the dis message under the name of a clergy and it's a denomination of spirit where young men are like puet workers that are working for the big boss you not working for me you working for [Applause] God I am only God manager I am a steward of what belongs to God people feel the pastor more than [Applause] God if you tell somebody I'm going to tell God get out I'm going to tell the pastor please I'm sorry [Applause] who do you fear who do you Fe who do you Fe are we together is everybody alive so they ask this boy follow me at the beginning of the end he never went home he moved from a denomination to a place that he begin to eat husk what does husk mean williiam Marion Bram me I don't know what to preach I only preach what brother Bram preaching in the message the Masterpiece brother Bram say but what denominated does what dies like life in who Luther a harlot went to make what Wesley a harlot from Wesley he went to what Pentecost and from Pentecost to make the what the original sea onto Pentecost came out who Wesley until that time the reason that Pentecost came out of Wesley because he was no what denomination Pentecost was then Pentecost went to what denominate what did he do it turned into a what [Applause] [Music] the are we together are we together so the Pentecostal at the beginning of the end at the beginning of the LI aition churches amen a move came called the Pentecost and brother Bram said they turn into a HK amen Oh Glory to God Amen he look like what P he looked like the real thing Pentecost came out of what the Wesley because Wesley was what an organization Harlot Pentecost came out as no organization and then it turned into one and he had to to make the H the True Word of Life on it was on its way then to the what original grain so the child when famine begin to come he went to a Pentecostal organization before heading home I'm going slowly my friend he says the says the True Word of Life was on its way then to the original what grain through what these stages through the what the stock then what into the pollen from pollen into the what the husk and from the husk he made what SE if you notice after he finished with the czm he went straight home there is no other step after the citizen with the H there is no other blockage after you go through l through W through Pentecost which is the last organization the boy went home Hallelujah are we together are we together are we together Lord help me brother brother say and notice them the what the husk when he comes forth look just like what the grain but when the grain Life begin to leave the what the H to go to make what the grain which is what the bride so the bride is the original grain okay the husk did what opens up and did what ex communicates the grave you going to be pushed out [Applause] he communicate the gra is that right nature that is exactly what she did so this boy mov from a state of a harot tree to the last state when famine kicking the last day God will send famine and famine drove him to join a citizen and this citizen made him go all the way to the hus but he was not meant for the hus amen follow me carefully we claming my friend jum to verse uh 17 watch what happened brother Bram say the one who spoke to this boy is the Angel of the Lord amen amen I have the quote I gave it to you so the angel of the Lord came when the boy was in the state with a HK that's right that's when the pillar of fire comes right because when the Lisha Church started that's the turn off the pillar of fire are we together job to verse 17 and when he came to to what himself okay he said how many what hired Servants of my fathers have what bread enough and to spare and as perish here with what with Hunger when the boy came to himself he begin to remember H's food he begin to remember home bread are we together are we together but the bread that he was remembering was the bread of the servant it's the same Bible we read all along the bread he was remembering was the bread of the servant amen are we together and we found out that the servant were who they were Angel so the boy was Desiring the food of what the boy was Desiring Angelic food are we together and Angelic food in the Bible is Mana put your finger right here my friend let's go to Psalm 78 Lord help me you're driving me slow let's go to Psalm 78 if you dare you can say Amen don't worry we'll get somewhere Psalm 78 if you dare you can say Amen am Psalm 78 verse 25 you there the Bible say say man did eat what Angels food he sent them meat to the what F so Mana was called in the Bible what Angels food and the boy begin to desire the food of who the food of Angels the Mana amen amen what is Mana what is the angel food go back to John chapter 6 Oh Glory to God if you thereare you can say Amen John 6:31 you there amen oh God our Father you go yes sir we're going slowly my friend it's a B52 it's a B52 you will wake up our father did eat what man we clear I'm on verse 31 Our Father verse 31 did eat Mana where in the Des they ate the angel food as it is it is written he gave them what bread bread from what heaven so Mana was the Bread of Heaven I'm reading the Bible are we together but he was the bread the food of the Angel and this boy is Desiring the angel food the servant food I'm reading the Bible my friend are we together he says our father did eat Mana in the desert as it is written he gave them bread from what heaven bread from Heaven to eat which is Mana which is angel food then Jesus said to them verily verily I say to you Moses gave you none not that bread from from heaven but my father give you the what follow me carefully because I'm driving a different thing here amen we found out here I don't want to lose you that the child desire what the servant food amen the servant were angels are we together yes sir so the food he was Desiring was Angelic food amen the food of the Angel and the food of the angel in the Bible is Mana amen and Jesus now is calling Mana The Bread of Heaven amen remember the boy say the servant of my father have bread and if you notice he said they have bread enough and to spare so that food is not just a food that satisfy you it is a food that is abundant I'm going slow it is bread to eat and to water in other word when you get to that food you will eat but you will never be able to finish it are we together so this food that the boy is Desiring it's a food that you can eat and spare it's an abundant food and it's a food that when you eat you will never finish it amen amen you will eat eat eat and you fool and you find out that they are still leftovers we want another food and Jesus said the bread that came down from heaven is Mana now Jesus is saying that listen Moses did can give you that bread let me read my friend he said Jesus said to them verse 32 verily I say to you amen Moses gave you not that bread from what heaven for but my father give you what the true bread from Heaven the true bread from what heaven so Mana was a type Mana was a type man was an indication of something are we together are we together in other word Mana was speaking of a bread Mana was indicating there is a true Mana coming up and that Mana also will come down from heaven but what is that Mana we clear are we okay amen jum to verse uh uh 33 for the bread of God is Who ah so now bread is a person on now the bread of God is he which come down from what heaven and give life to the what the world who came down from heaven and give life to the world who is he Jesus Christ so Mana was speaking of Christ amen my friend are we together amen we are studying so Mana was speaking of Christ everybody C everybody clear everybody clear in other word follow me carefully let's focus here in other word first of all when you look at Mana the description of Mana is angel food follow me my friend when you look at Mana he belongs to Angel he Came From Heaven amen but if you focus very good on Mana you will find out that Mana was not really talking about angel Mana was talking about Christ I'm guing somewhere I'm heading somewhere when you see it some of you will scream are you ready my friend jum to verse 34 then say they to him Lord ever more give us what this bread in other words forever more every day please give us this bread a bread that come from Heaven you receive it and you have life we want to have that bread but I got a news for you you have that bread but you don't know you going to know that bread relax my friend please keep following me very tight are we together are we together am Jesus say on verse 35 and Jesus said to them I I am am we heading somewhere I am what the bread of life he that cometh to me shall what never hunger remember the boy was hungry but if you get to the father you will never hungry I am the bread of life and he that cometh to me will not shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never do what thirst jop to verse 48 my friend if you dare you can say amen I am what that bread of life so the bread of life is who Christ the bread of life that came down from heaven is who Christ that's why the Bible say he was the hidden manner am the Bible in the book of revation say that Jesus Christ was the hidden man do you know that do you know that so Jesus was a manner that was hidden I don't know if you getting me it's a manner that was hidden a manner that was hidden it was not open Slow Down slow down a man that was hidden slow down we getting somewhere are we together I told you I'm having a B52 it's a manner that was what the hidden you see Pentecost say hidden manner hidden manner you need to know what hidden manner means are we together are we together verse 48 what did he say I am what that bread of life your fathers did eat Mana in the wilderness and are dead separated this is the bread which came down from what heaven that a man eats thereof and not die I am the what the living bread the living bread which came down from what heaven so the living Mana is Christ because Mana was the bread from Heaven amen but the true bread is Christ amen I am the living bread which came down from what heaven If any man do what eat of this bread he shall live how forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh the Flesh of the son of man is my flesh which I will give for life of the what world follow me carefully what are you trying to say pastor this boy are we together desire the angel food and the food of the servant he said in my father house the my servant the servant of my father have bread and they have bread to eat and to spare so when the boy came back to himself what brought him back connect him to the food or the bread of the servant and the bread of the servant is the bread of the Angel and the bread of the Angel was mana and Jesus say Mana was the bread that came down from heaven but Jesus said your father ate that Mana but they were dead but the true Mana is me myself because I came down from heaven so the Mana from Heaven is what Crist at the beginning it looks like angel food but if you turn it to the right it's going to look like [Applause] trrust at the beginning it was seven angels that brought this message but when we turn the picture it is not seven angels it is Crist in the middle of the picture and they call Jesus Christ the hidden what he was a cross that was locked a cross that was sealed a cross that was locked for their generation so this boy needed a word to be open that's why when he was coming home he was not the servant he was the father himself [Applause] that came to meet him decl himself because the bread was the bread of the father when you see my father you see [Applause] bread are we together are we together it's not Angel my friend it is true it's Angelic food but if you turn it is Christ Hall amen every day one Angel come and give the food one Angel come and give the food but when we put together and brother Bram say seven Angel seven Angel God say boy turn the picture to the right amen it is not Angel really turn the picture to the right because God has seven [Applause] Spirit and the Bible say there are seven spirit of God God and brother Bram say it is not seven different Spirit but is one Spirit who can manifest itself in seven ways but when you take those seven spirit and you put it together and you change the angle that you looking at you want to see Christ this message is [Applause] Christ are we together are we together then the boy begin to move home are we together then boys begin to move home the Bible says let's go back to uh Luke 15 oh God have mercy do you see how many layers there are in this scripture it's a food that you cannot finish when you eat you eat you full this Su but there are some to spare Ah that's why this message is unlimited unlimited unlimited Angelic food amen amen amen we will preach we will preach we will preach until we go to the rapture we leave again it's the grand of Joseph no number to put into it no stop to put into it are we together verse 17 and when he came to himself he said how many hired servant of my father have what bread enough and and I and to spare and I perish with Hunger go ahead my friend I will arise and go to my I will arise and go to my father and do what and will say unto him get ready my friend go continue father I have sinned against Heaven if you notice it start with repentance because the Zeal of laisha is to repent continue my friend and before thee uhhuh and am no more worthy to be called thy son make me as one of thy hired servants mhm and he arose and came to his father stop my friend do you know that the the the food is the food of the servant amen and the servant has a compound meaning amen servant means angels are we together but servant also means something else because according to Revelation 10:7 the Bible say when the seven angels SS the what the trumpet what happened please put your finger like this let's go to Revelation 10 let's go my friend verse seven but in the days of what the voice of who when he shall begin to do what the mystery of who God should be what finished as he has declared to who his servants the prophet his servant who the prophet so the servant also means what prophet so the food of the servant is a prophetic food it is a prophetic message a son of man message are we together are we together let's go back to Luke 10 uh Luke 15 go ahead my friend in verse 20 and he arose and came to his father but when he was yet the great far off you understand this the father saw him you there amen and had compassion on him and compassion and run and fell on his neck and did what and kissed him and he said what father I have sinned against heaven and in thy sight uh-huh and am no more worthy to be called thy son uh-huh but the father said to his servants uh-huh bring forth the best robe uhhuh and put it on him you remember the father was here right and the son was here right and both of them were far from home we clear yes sir thank you and when the father came he brought servant you already understand that go ahead my friend verse 22 but the father said to his servants uh-huh bring forth the best Rob uh-huh and put it on him okay and put a ring on his hand okay and shoes on his feet okay and bring hither the Fatt calf and do what and kill it and let us eat and be what be married push the break there and put your seat belt okay amen this is where we stopped last time yes amen the father when he met the son here both of them were far away from home am are we together both of them were in the middle of the way amen and the father gave here an order to kill the fatted Cal Amen to kill the f Cal and to initiate the feast are we together so the feast didn't happened right away but the command of the feast came right away but there is a period of time this is now follow me my friend please I beg you follow me there is a period of time between the killing of the FED calf and the cooking and the decoration of sister am are we together until the feast began amen are we together and brother Bram says this in the message the Rapture he says the third thing is what the trumpet which always at the Feast of what trumpet is calling the people to what the feast and that shall be what the bride supper the what lamb supper with the bride where in the sky the first that come forth is what his message calling what the bride together bringing the boy back home the next thing is what a resurrection of the sleeping brde the one that died back in the other days they are done what caught together and the what trumpet the feast where in the heavens in the sky why that is the thing that is taking place are we together Hallelujah the sound the trumpet already sanded because Jesus does all three when he comes down but the Fulfillment the Fulfillment the actual literal Fe off the trumpet all the Ser of the bre is not yet there is a period of preparation they have to take the r and put on you and take the ring and put on you and put shoes on you and clean you up before the feast begin are we together are we together but when do we know that the feast is about to begin amen this is where we sto last time that you need to look at the last Trump you remember last time put your seat belt you need to look at the last Trump not the first Trump but the last Trump I'm not talking about Donald Trump I'm talking about prophetic son more event made clear by prophecy are we

of what John chapter what 18 verse what 10 then Simon Peter having a what a sword Jewish and SM who the high priest servant and cut off his what right ear I'm giving you time my friend amen and his name was what marus Marcus if you look at the Bible it means a king or a ruler [Applause] are we together so when the pressure of the ecuminical begin to come upon Jesus Christ upon the son of man we find a servant of the high priest who is injured in the right here [Applause] if you notice Marcus was the servant the servant to who high priest the servant to the high priest amen who is the high priest brother the Bible says in verse 13 and they led him to who Ana first for he was the father-in-law to who which was the what high priest that in that same what brother Bram say kaas he could not see it he was a what he was a what a pop of what are we together are we together so Marcus was a servant of the pop in other word he would do job for the pop and if you notice before Donald Trump passed he met with the Catholic [Applause] church and the Catholic Church gave him his approval because the Catholic are already in the cabinet now he's a servant to the Catholic church that's why he received an injury to the right here is a son that this world is about to be crucified but thank God he was the third [Applause] pool remember Jesus said father you already glorify me but glorify me again it is the time of glorification that's why brother say when you see the squeeze begin to want to come watch the turn to and how do I know the squeeze is coming look at the inury to the right [Applause] here somebody's going to serve the pop because the Catholic is in the cabinet but thank God if you notice Jesus was the one that healed the injury [Applause] it is God that save [Applause]

Christ because Jesus Took the up and accepted the sin he became a god with sin just like you God with [Applause] sin now the miracle of Marcus it was a miracle done by a God who was a sinner so it is the time of you who are sin to be God [Applause] the work that I do you going to do it and you going to do how Jesus Christ was by was baptizing people the Bible say Jesus baptized the people with the disciple by the disciple but when Jesus became a sinner he sent somebody to heaven without wor about [Applause] fight me my friend I got the scripture in other words this world is going to see a demonstration of the power of God like never [Applause] before Jesus did it tell the Fe at the cross that you need to get baptized he said you know what today with me that's why at right children receive the Holy Ghost without the [Applause] baptism Church the entry of Donald Trump is a son we are entering the temp the last Ministry of Jesus Christ before souls in prison somebody must receive
