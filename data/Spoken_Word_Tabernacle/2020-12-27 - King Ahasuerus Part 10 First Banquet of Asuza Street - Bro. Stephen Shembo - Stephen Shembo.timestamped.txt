[30:45] have not have any opportunity to get it
[30:48] everybody clear so far so Lord's willing
[30:50] we must send a text throughout the week
[30:52] just to remind you that our service is
[30:55] not here on Wednesday but it's on
[30:57] Thursday thday the
[30:59] 31st amen so we can pray spend some time
[31:03] worshiping the Lord thank him for
[31:05] everything for his grace his Mercy
[31:08] through this pandemic he have been with
[31:10] us
[31:12] amen I'm going to
[31:15] call two special people we have this
[31:18] morning by God's grace but before I do
[31:21] that let's go to Matthew chapter
[31:26] 1 need to have your Bible just a few
[31:32] minute and this is not our
[31:35] normal reading but I just want to make a
[31:38] point on what we're going to do
[31:41] here the Bible says in verse 18 if you
[31:45] dare you can say
[31:46] Amen the Bible says that now the birth
[31:50] of Jesus Christ was on this
[31:55] wise when as his mother pages are still
[32:00] turning just
[32:02] waiting everybody
[32:04] there everybody
[32:06] there okay Verse 18 now the birth of
[32:10] Jesus Christ was on this
[32:14] wise Verse 18 Matthew 1 verse
[32:18] 18 when as his mother Mary was
[32:21] engaged if you notice here the word used
[32:25] is
[32:26] engaged amen amen when they say engaged
[32:30] that means that they are not married yet
[32:32] but they to be married amen Mary was
[32:37] engaged to Joseph before they came
[32:41] together you might be seated so there is
[32:44] an engagement first before they come
[32:47] together as husband and wife so we don't
[32:50] want to flip that around Mary was
[32:53] engaged to Joseph before they came
[32:55] together in other words before they get
[32:57] married first you get engaged then you
[33:00] get married she was found with a child
[33:04] of the Holy Ghost in other word she got
[33:07] pregnant before they got married
[33:10] amen verse 19 then Joseph her husband
[33:15] being a just
[33:16] man and not willing to make her a public
[33:20] example a just man will not be running
[33:23] his MTH out against his wife
[33:28] did you hear that amen did you hear that
[33:32] a
[33:33] Christian just man should not be on the
[33:37] internet Facebook on Twitter on WhatsApp
[33:41] on the telephone gossiping about his
[33:47] wife you don't say amen that's fine your
[33:49] ears are saying
[33:53] amen
[33:56] amen I know some are not here so we we
[33:59] going to work our way out then Joseph
[34:02] her husband if you notice Joseph is
[34:04] called a husband but they are not
[34:06] married
[34:08] yet so even though he's called married
[34:11] there is still even though he's called
[34:12] husband there is still limitation to
[34:15] certain
[34:16] things Hallelujah being a just man and
[34:20] not willing to make her a public example
[34:23] was minded to put her away prly
[34:27] verse 20 but while he thought on these
[34:32] things behold the angel of the Lord
[34:34] appeared to him in a dream saying Joseph
[34:38] you son of David fear not to take to you
[34:42] Mary your wife so even in Heaven by
[34:46] being engaged already God is recognizing
[34:50] that it's a husband and wife but to be
[34:53] married not a husband and wife to have
[34:56] children that's the reason why Joseph
[34:58] was trying to get mared out separated
[35:02] privately amen so what I'm trying to
[35:05] make a point here when you are
[35:07] engaged you are not permitted on the
[35:11] physical you are only engaged to be
[35:16] married amen there was only one virgin
[35:21] birth so I don't expect the Virgin birth
[35:24] in this church
[35:28] Amen in other word I don't expect any
[35:31] woman here who's not married to get
[35:33] pregnant you get engaged first you get
[35:36] married then we're waiting for the baby
[35:39] amen blessed be the name of the Lord
[35:42] saying
[35:44] Joseph you son of David fear not to take
[35:47] your wife Mary your wife for that which
[35:50] is conceived in hell is of the Holy
[35:54] Ghost there is only one promise it only
[35:56] happened one time and that's what we are
[35:59] believing and for everybody else there
[36:02] is a process you get to talk to the lady
[36:06] you get engaged once you get engaged
[36:08] Lord's willing he open the way we Bless
[36:10] The Wedding then praise the lord we
[36:13] ready for baby shower everybody clear
[36:15] praise the name of the Lord so this
[36:17] morning I'm going to call Brother Joshua
[36:20] N he's here with with us this morning
[36:23] brother Josh you can come up here
[36:28] many of you don't know him but we're

[36:55] Mickey's first daughter sister T is here

[37:06] Joseph brother Joshua and sister Tia are
[37:15] engaged

[37:28] so if there was a young man that have
[37:30] been watching sister
[37:34] teer this is too
[37:37] late amen it is already too late she is
[37:42] engaged in the eyes of God it's husband
[37:47] and wife to be married everybody clear
[37:51] so we also want to ask the family who

[39:52] 5 we preached on this before so in this
[39:55] church you should be familiar with this
[39:57] story
[39:57] but I'm just going to draw one point
[39:59] into it chapter 5 verse1 if you thereare
[40:02] you can say
[40:04] amen I am come in my garden you already
[40:08] know what a garden means it's a woman my
[40:12] sister that's the garden my spouse we
[40:15] already explained to you sister spouse
[40:18] you got to be married to a
[40:21] sister before she becomes your wife in
[40:24] other words she need to be
[40:25] Christian amen
[40:28] I have gathered my mirr with my spice I
[40:31] have eaten my Honey C with my honey you
[40:35] might be
[40:36] seated I have drunk my wine with my milk
[40:40] there is a milk here which is for the
[40:42] baby and there is a wine which is uh
[40:45] speaking of the Holy Spirit and the
[40:47] stimulation of the
[40:49] Revelation I have drunk my wine with my
[40:53] milk eat if you notice there he's now
[40:56] calling to
[40:58] friends he says eat oh
[41:02] friends drink yeah drink abundantly or
[41:07] beloved we know clearly by this
[41:09] scripture that it was Solomon going to
[41:12] the
[41:13] shat but we found out that as he's going
[41:16] to the shat he's not alone now here they
[41:20] are calling for friends so in this
[41:25] occasion in this big
[41:27] reception or whatever have to take place
[41:30] here it is not only the king and the
[41:34] queen but there is somebody there called
[41:38] into this occasion but those person are
[41:41] the friends amen we know Jesus called
[41:45] Judah his friends let's go to John
[41:47] chapter
[41:50] 6 John chapter 6 verse 70 we have King
[41:56] Solomon and and the
[41:58] sh but as they come together there is a
[42:01] presence of a
[42:03] friends
[42:05] amen there is a
[42:08] king there is an Esther because we are
[42:11] dealing with Esther but when Esther is
[42:15] inviting the king there must be him and
[42:19] there you got it clear praise the name
[42:22] of the Lord John chapter 6 verse 7 if
[42:25] you dare you can say Amen
[42:29] Jesus answered
[42:30] them have not I chosen you 12 so the one
[42:35] who chose the disciple is Jesus Christ
[42:39] himself amen so usually we think when
[42:42] Jesus pick everything he's going to pick
[42:45] the perfect one but for some reason he
[42:48] chose 12 but one of them was not from
[42:53] him yet he was called to work in the
[42:56] ministry of Christ he say have I not
[42:59] chosen you 12 and one of you is what it
[43:04] is Christ that pick Judah it is Jesus
[43:08] Christ that pick the devil into his
[43:12] ministry amen you might be wondering why
[43:15] did Esther call the king but she's also
[43:18] calling hon which is a top of the devil
[43:22] amen but before the great victory can
[43:27] happen to the
[43:29] human to humanity God have to call the
[43:33] devil into that Ministry amen you cannot
[43:37] fulfill a
[43:39] great Victory without the devil being
[43:44] present he say and one of you is a devil
[43:48] verse 71 he spoke of Judah is carot the
[43:52] son of Simon for he he was that should
[43:56] betray him being one of the 12 amen
[44:00] let's go to Romans chapter 7
[44:04] now and we're going to
[44:07] pray if you dare you can say
[44:10] Amen Roman 12 chapter
[44:14] 15
[44:18] Hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[44:20] Lord verse 15 chapter 8 7 verse1 15 for
[44:26] thou which are
[44:29] do I allow not for what I would that I
[44:34] do that do I not but what I hate that do
[44:41] I in other word what I want to do I
[44:44] cannot do it and what I don't want to do
[44:48] that's what I found myself
[44:50] doing remember this is Apostle Paul that
[44:54] is talking Paul here is already being
[44:58] baptized and fill with the baptism of
[45:01] the Holy Spirit we saw it last Sunday
[45:05] this is not a sinner talking this is a
[45:07] Christian being filled with the holy
[45:10] spirit that is telling you that I found
[45:12] out that when I want to do something I
[45:14] cannot do it and what I don't want to do
[45:17] I found myself doing it amen in other
[45:20] words there is a war that I found within
[45:24] myself everybody clear and if verse 16
[45:30] if then I do that which I would not I
[45:34] consent in other word I agree to the law
[45:38] that it is good we already explained you
[45:40] the law verse 17 now then it is no more
[45:44] I that do it but sin that dwells in me
[45:50] in other word Paul is an entity he's a
[45:53] man but Paul is telling you that Within
[45:57] me we are two people there is one person
[46:02] that is called the inward man we're
[46:04] going to see it right now and there is
[46:07] another that is called the other man or
[46:10] the man of the outside the other man is
[46:13] the physical man that's your body which
[46:16] we call the body amen the inward is the
[46:21] spiritual man amen which brother Bram
[46:24] referred to that as the Inside Man
[46:27] sometime and Paul says that I am already
[46:30] filled with the Holy Spirit I am a
[46:33] Christian I am trying everything that I
[46:36] can to believe and to please the Lord
[46:40] but I find myself that whenever I want
[46:42] to do that which is good I cannot do it
[46:45] but what I don't want to do that's what
[46:47] I'm doing and Paul says that I found
[46:50] that it is not me it is not the inward
[46:53] man it is not this man that is filled
[46:56] with the holy spirit amen it is not this
[47:00] man of the inside it is the outside man
[47:05] that is doing that and the outside man
[47:08] which is the body within that body Paul
[47:10] say there is still sin am everybody
[47:14] clear so whenever you are walking you
[47:18] have an enemy with
[47:20] you make sense when you sleep you are
[47:24] sleeping with your enemy
[47:28] when you wake up you are waking up with
[47:30] your enemy when you coming to church you
[47:33] are bringing your
[47:34] enemy he's not outside like you think
[47:38] he's right within
[47:40] you
[47:42] amen Verse 18 for I know that in me this
[47:47] is
[47:48] Paul that is in my the body everybody
[47:52] clear and all that in me that is in the
[47:56] flesh in my body does no good thing
[48:00] nothing good in a body I thought when
[48:03] you receive the Holy Spirit everything
[48:05] is
[48:07] done amen for to will is present with me
[48:12] I have that
[48:13] will but how to perform that which is
[48:16] good I found not in other word there is
[48:18] a
[48:19] hindrance amen verse 19 for the good
[48:24] that I would I do not but the evil which
[48:28] I would not that I
[48:30] do now if I do that I would not it is no
[48:34] more I that do it everybody clear but
[48:38] who s sin that dwells where so Paul is
[48:43] telling you that it is not me that is
[48:45] doing that it is this body that is doing
[48:49] that but on the inside man I'm trying to
[48:51] preach the Lord everybody clear verse 21
[48:56] and I found
[48:58] then a law that when I will do good evil
[49:02] is present with me for I Delight in the
[49:06] law of God after the what the inward men
[49:10] after the inside men I love the Lord I
[49:13] love his law everybody clear but I see
[49:16] another law in my members in the body
[49:21] Waring against me that law is not there
[49:24] to pet you that that law is not there to
[49:29] condone with you that law is not there
[49:32] to help you to leave a Christian Life
[49:36] that law is there to war against you so
[49:39] you cannot live a Christian life amen if
[49:44] you don't know what I'm talking about
[49:46] when you woke up this morning that Lord
[49:49] was telling you you can stay
[49:51] home that was telling you you are too
[49:54] sleepy that tell you they are streaming
[49:58] the service you don't have to get in
[50:00] your car you can stay at home and you
[50:03] can stream the service I'm not saying
[50:06] those that are streaming are under that
[50:08] law I'm just making a point amen because
[50:10] they have a legitimate reason for
[50:12] staying there but that's the LA that
[50:14] make you ly that's the LA that don't
[50:17] want you to pray that's the LA that want
[50:20] you to get closer to God and that law is
[50:24] not there for peace it is
[50:27] that is in your body
[50:32] for verse 23 but I see another law in my
[50:37] M war against the law of my mind the
[50:41] spirit and bringing me into captivity to
[50:45] the law of sin which is in my member in
[50:50] other word within me said that I have
[50:54] two
[50:55] dos that's right are you following me
[50:58] you need to read your message I have a
[51:00] black
[51:02] dog come on every and I have a white
[51:07] do that the mystery of the Indian CH
[51:12] when he got
[51:13] converted said Chief how are you doing
[51:16] and the chief said uhuh since I got
[51:18] converted I'm in trouble he said what's
[51:21] going on the chief said that within me I
[51:23] got two dog and those dog have
[51:26] constantly all the time they are
[51:29] fighting one with
[51:31] another amen but this message doesn't
[51:35] only describe you but the message also
[51:38] give you the solution to how to
[51:40] overcome and brother brandham say so how
[51:43] do you overcome he say it depend on the
[51:46] one I'm feeding the one I'm feeding the
[51:49] most that's the one that is taking over
[51:53] amen whether I'm spending my time in
[51:55] prayer in meditation in fasting or I'm
[51:59] spending my time on
[52:01] Facebook on Twitter on internet wasting
[52:05] my time and trying to please

[53:30] according to their need Lord father we
[53:32] humbly ask it in the name of Jesus
[53:34] Christ amen God bless you this morning
[53:38] we are continuing on our series The King
[53:41] aass three feast and Esther two
[53:46] banquet we found out and we explain to
[53:49] you that the Book of Esther have Seven
[53:52] Feast the first three feasts were the
[53:55] feast that were made by King aerus
[53:59] himself on the first Feast we explain to
[54:01] you that he was the Jewish dispensation
[54:04] when God was dealing with the Jews then
[54:07] there follow another Feast of seven days
[54:10] which we unfold by the message of the
[54:12] hour that is it was a feast of the seven
[54:15] Church ages where God is not dealing
[54:18] with the Jews anymore but God was
[54:20] dealing with the Gentile then on the
[54:23] third Feast explained to you that it was
[54:25] the Feast of the marriage supper because
[54:28] it was called Esther's Feast that the
[54:30] king made for the honor of Queen Esther
[54:34] but we found out that in between the
[54:37] three Feast of king aerus and the two
[54:40] banquet that was prepared by Ester that
[54:43] there was a feast that was hidden there
[54:46] and through the help of brother Branham
[54:48] we came to decode that Feast that it was
[54:51] the three days fasting of Esther which
[54:54] we spoke last Sunday and and brother
[54:56] Bram explained to us that a
[54:58] feast fasting a body it is a feast with
[55:02] the Lord so after that then Esther begin
[55:06] to uh prepare her first banquet then the
[55:09] second banquet then the last Feast is
[55:12] going to be the Feast of purum which
[55:14] makes all together Seven Feast because
[55:17] seven is God's number to reveal himself
[55:20] in his mathematics everybody clear now
[55:24] last Sunday when we looked at the seven
[55:27] churches according to Revelation 14 we
[55:30] saw that there were three special angels
[55:34] that were mentioned we know that the
[55:36] seven Church ages is a is a dispensation
[55:38] of the Gentile that goes with seven
[55:41] messenger from Paul all the way to
[55:44] brother Branham but in Revelation 7 uh
[55:48] 14 there was a section that was taken
[55:51] particularly to explain three special
[55:54] Angel and brother Bram explained to us
[55:57] that those Angel were Luther and the
[55:59] second one was Wesley and the third one
[56:02] was himself William Maran Branham and
[56:06] what made those angels special was
[56:09] because the three Ministry were speaking
[56:12] about the three steps of Grace Luther
[56:15] preached
[56:16] justification Wesley preached
[56:19] sanctification and in the age of laisha
[56:22] we are dealing with the age of the
[56:24] baptism of the holy spirit amen and
[56:28] those step affect the individual affect
[56:32] the church and also affected the Earth
[56:35] because the Earth went through
[56:37] justification through the waters of Noah
[56:40] and he went through just uh to
[56:42] sanctification brother Bram say when
[56:44] Christ was on the cross his blood sh was
[56:48] shed and the blood touched the Earth and
[56:50] sanctify the Earth but Peter also
[56:53] explained to us that the Earth will be
[56:55] burned
[56:56] so we will still have
[56:58] justification sanctification baptism of
[57:02] the Holy Spirit everybody clear so now
[57:05] when we get back to the Book of Esther
[57:08] that we have been studying the second
[57:10] Feast of King aerus was a 7day feast of
[57:14] wine but we found out that in between
[57:17] those feasts and the banquet of Esther
[57:20] there was another Feast that was placed
[57:23] there which is the three days of fasting
[57:25] of Queen Esther before she goes into the
[57:29] presence of the king because Esther
[57:31] described to us that there was 30 days
[57:34] that was there that she was never she
[57:37] never saw the king and we explain to you
[57:39] that 30 have three numbers three which
[57:42] is a number of perfection giving us the
[57:45] three step and then zero which is
[57:47] eternity which is speaking of number8
[57:50] because both eight and zero are the same
[57:53] everybody clear so far now when we read
[57:57] brother Bram here just to kind of
[57:58] underline it again brother Bram say in
[58:01] the message Paradox that I was planning
[58:04] on taking a fast to the Lord I told him
[58:08] that I would go out and fast amen when I
[58:12] come when you come to this Feast which
[58:14] is a fast which a fast in the body is a
[58:18] feast with the Lord if you notice
[58:21] brother Bram is talking about the fast
[58:23] in the body because usually when when we
[58:26] are fasting the thing that is affected
[58:29] in our life is our body amen so when we
[58:32] are fasting we are actually inflicting
[58:36] our body we are actually treating our
[58:39] body a little bit harder because the
[58:41] body want to eat the body want to drink
[58:44] the body want to sleep but when you fast
[58:46] you are telling the body you're not
[58:48] going to drink today you're not going to
[58:50] eat today you're not going to do
[58:51] anything today but being in the presence
[58:54] of the Lord and even the Lord Jesus
[58:56] Christ we found out that when we fasted
[58:59] the Bible says that he got hungry and he
[59:01] also got weak everybody clear praise the
[59:04] name of the Lord so a feast a fast in
[59:08] the body is a feast with the Lord
[59:11] everybody clear yourself far am now
[59:13] brother Bram says
[59:15] that in a message T that I think David
[59:19] in the writing of the psalm if you read
[59:22] the message thirst you will know the
[59:23] psalm he's referring to m they have been
[59:26] in distress and when we read in the Book
[59:30] of Esther we found out that what brought
[59:33] actually the fasting in the life of
[59:37] Esther was trouble it took distress to
[59:40] bring Esther into fasting Esther was in
[59:45] the king's Palace she never fasted
[59:48] before Esther was sitting everything was
[59:50] handed to her she was living a good life
[59:54] she was living a luxurious life she was
[59:56] living a comfortable life until the news
[1:00:00] came and they told her that you are in
[1:00:02] trouble and it took trouble to drive
[1:00:06] Esther into a life of a
[1:00:09] consecration everybody clear your so far
[1:00:11] brother Bram say must have been in
[1:00:14] distress and it usually takes
[1:00:17] what you need to wake up it's usually
[1:00:20] taking what distress to bring the best
[1:00:23] out of a man it trouble in your life to
[1:00:28] bring the best out of you we don't want
[1:00:31] to trouble we don't want to go to trial
[1:00:34] we don't want to go through difficulty
[1:00:36] but there is no way out for God to bring
[1:00:39] himself out but to push you into a
[1:00:42] corner everybody clear brother Bram
[1:00:45] continue he says that get down to when
[1:00:49] we
[1:00:51] fast many times brother bham is
[1:00:53] explaining fasting now he says many
[1:00:56] times I'm going to go back here he say
[1:00:58] it really that is when God gets down to
[1:01:02] when we fast we're talking about a fast
[1:01:05] which is a feast in the body butam say
[1:01:08] many time he's explaining a fast to get
[1:01:12] ourself in a position to get ourself out
[1:01:16] of the way so brother Bram is explaining
[1:01:19] here that a fast is a is a mean that God
[1:01:24] have prepared to make you get out of
[1:01:28] position amen get out of your way and
[1:01:32] begin to depend completely on the Lord
[1:01:36] amen a fast get you in the position of
[1:01:42] dependency a fast get you in the
[1:01:45] position when you have to surrender
[1:01:48] everything a fast put you in the
[1:01:51] position when you have to seek for a
[1:01:54] power that is is higher than your power
[1:01:58] a fast put you in a position of perfect
[1:02:02] weakness and when you are weak then God
[1:02:06] is strong everybody clear if you notice
[1:02:11] when Jesus begin to fast the devil never
[1:02:14] came to him but after fasting the Bible
[1:02:17] says that he got hungry and Jesus was
[1:02:20] weak and the devil thought that when
[1:02:23] he's weak that is the time to get him
[1:02:27] but he didn't understand that fasting
[1:02:30] was a position of yielding was a
[1:02:33] position when you put your call in new
[1:02:37] was a position when you stop working for
[1:02:39] your life and you begin to depend on God
[1:02:42] to lead you and to guide you and to take
[1:02:45] over your life and when Satan tried to
[1:02:49] attack the Lord Jesus Christ he found
[1:02:51] out that he got the wrong number amen
[1:02:54] one day the disciple were going with
[1:02:57] Jesus into the boat and Jesus was

[1:07:33] [Music]
[1:07:36] up amen we found our way to play with
[1:07:40] the pandemic amen a first it's a feast
[1:07:45] in the body when we are dealing with the
[1:07:48] body here I want to make mention that
[1:07:50] there is two sort of body that we
[1:07:52] dealing with we are dealing with the
[1:07:55] body
[1:07:56] as the Church of God Amen because the
[1:07:59] Church of God is the temple of God it is
[1:08:02] the body of the Lord it is also called
[1:08:04] The Bride of Jesus Christ and when we
[1:08:07] speak also about the body the body also
[1:08:10] spoke about you as an individual because
[1:08:13] you also you are a temple of God Amen
[1:08:17] brother Bram says this in the message BL
[1:08:20] Blasphemous name he says now that then
[1:08:23] from this and then bringing this into
[1:08:26] the seven Church ages God is building in
[1:08:30] seven Church ages a brad for Christ
[1:08:33] these are the seven Church ages drop
[1:08:35] down here they awoke the virgin of
[1:08:38] Ephesus smina pergamus tatara Sardis
[1:08:43] Philadelphia and laoda did you notice
[1:08:47] that through the years ages he has built
[1:08:51] a bride born bride be begotten a bride
[1:08:56] on Earth for Christ and this is the key
[1:08:59] point and the same way that he begets
[1:09:02] the bride he has begot what the same way
[1:09:07] God is dealing with a church that's the
[1:09:10] same way he's dealing with you as an
[1:09:14] individual everybody clear so far
[1:09:16] brother brandham continues here he says
[1:09:19] and now as in the individual these
[1:09:22] virtues and things are knowledge and
[1:09:24] temporal
[1:09:26] is added to our faith then when we come
[1:09:29] then when the Capstone comes the Holy
[1:09:33] Spirit cements it together there is the
[1:09:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost and then God
[1:09:39] through that has brought also seven
[1:09:42] Church ages to show the seven step that
[1:09:45] he brought building his what individual
[1:09:49] into his so when we will be talking here
[1:09:53] we will be talking back and forth about
[1:09:55] the church as the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:09:58] and the church also as individual we are
[1:10:02] not building an
[1:10:04] organization I'm not here this morning
[1:10:06] to build an organization Christ never
[1:10:09] sent me to build
[1:10:11] organization Christ sent me to build
[1:10:14] what to the Statue of who that they
[1:10:18] might be the PowerHouse and the dwelling
[1:10:21] place of the a temple by his word by his
[1:10:26] to see build up the individual to the
[1:10:30] place not buildt an organization to a
[1:10:33] greater denomination but built the
[1:10:36] individual to Sons and Daughters of that
[1:10:40] is the dear everybody clear take
[1:10:44] galatian chapter
[1:10:49] 5 we are still climbing
[1:10:57] praise the name of the
[1:10:59] Lord if you dare you can say Amen just
[1:11:03] as a reminder Paul taught us that there
[1:11:06] is a law there is a law of sin that is
[1:11:09] working in the body there is an enemy in
[1:11:12] your body that is sin that enemy doesn't
[1:11:15] want to serve God he's not there for
[1:11:18] peace he's there forward but there is
[1:11:20] the inside man that is Born Again by the
[1:11:23] baptism of the Holy Spirit that is the
[1:11:26] man that want to serve God not your body
[1:11:29] amen Galatians chapter 5 verse 16 if you
[1:11:33] dare you can say amen amen this has say
[1:11:36] then walk in the
[1:11:39] what everybody there walk in the spirit
[1:11:44] and you shall not fulfill the last of
[1:11:47] the everybody clear now Paul is saying
[1:11:51] that as a Christian fill with the Holy
[1:11:54] Spirit you have the world in your body
[1:11:57] there is sin you have your enemy right
[1:12:00] beside you you sleep with him you wake
[1:12:03] up with him you take a shower with him
[1:12:06] you go everywhere with your enemy
[1:12:08] everybody clear but Paul is advising you
[1:12:12] he say walk in the spirit walk according
[1:12:16] to a Inside Man if you pay attention to
[1:12:20] the Holy Ghost you automatically are
[1:12:24] feeding the wife white dog and you will
[1:12:27] not be under the law of sin and death
[1:12:31] everybody clear so walk in the spirit
[1:12:35] and you shall not fulfill the lust of
[1:12:37] the flesh brother Steven I'm struggling
[1:12:41] I don't know how to live a Christian
[1:12:43] Life there is two ways to it either you
[1:12:46] don't have the baptism of the Holy
[1:12:48] Spirit you are not born again yet so you
[1:12:51] need to seek for the Holy Ghost you need
[1:12:53] to repent you need to be justified
[1:12:56] Sanctified baptized and baptized with
[1:12:59] the Holy Spirit baptized with water and
[1:13:01] baptized with the Holy Spirit that's the
[1:13:03] first step but if you are already being
[1:13:06] baptized and you believe that in your
[1:13:08] life you have the spirit of God for you
[1:13:11] to uh overcome this enemy Paul is
[1:13:15] telling you pay attention to the Holy
[1:13:17] Ghost amen once you pay attention to the
[1:13:20] Holy Ghost once you give yourself more
[1:13:23] to the things of God
[1:13:25] at that point automatically you will not
[1:13:29] fulfill the desire of the flesh a woman
[1:13:33] when she's married she have to attend to
[1:13:35] her husband by the baptism of the Holy
[1:13:38] Ghost you are married to Christ pay
[1:13:41] attention to crush your husband if you
[1:13:43] do that you shall not fulfill the lust
[1:13:46] of the flesh so if you are you have the
[1:13:48] Holy Ghost and you are still struggling
[1:13:51] in the flesh it's because you don't pay
[1:13:53] attention to your husband instead of
[1:13:56] listening to your husband instead of
[1:13:58] spending time with your husband you are
[1:14:00] spending time on Facebook with your
[1:14:07] friend no problem verse
[1:14:10] 17 for the
[1:14:12] flesh last against what remember it's a
[1:14:16] war everybody clear for the flesh last
[1:14:20] against the spirit and the spirit
[1:14:23] against the
[1:14:25] War everybody clear and these are
[1:14:29] what they are contrary in other words
[1:14:32] they are
[1:14:34] inos they are contrary the one to the
[1:14:38] other so that you cannot do the F that
[1:14:42] you that's why Paul in Romans 7 say what
[1:14:46] I want to do I don't do it what I don't
[1:14:49] want to do that's what I'm doing and
[1:14:52] Paul says that I found out there is war
[1:14:54] Within Me amen now in galatian Paul
[1:14:57] continues again that there is war there
[1:15:00] is an inside man the spirit and there is
[1:15:02] an outside man if you don't pay
[1:15:05] attention you're going to be worrying
[1:15:06] all the time and can't get nowhere as
[1:15:10] long as you fighting one another you
[1:15:12] can't go nowhere I'm not talking about
[1:15:15] one another with your neighbor with
[1:15:19] yourself amen Verse 18 but if you be led
[1:15:24] on of what Spirit you are not under the
[1:15:29] be led of the spirit and automatically
[1:15:33] by default this dog is weak everybody
[1:15:37] clear so
[1:15:38] far let's go to Romans chapter 8 we read
[1:15:43] Romans 7 let's go to
[1:15:47] 8 we drawing a point then we go back to
[1:15:52] Esther Romans chapter 8 if if you dare
[1:15:55] you can say
[1:15:56] Amen praise the name of the
[1:16:00] Lord Roman 8 ver
[1:16:06] 6 are you there for to be connly fleshly
[1:16:12] body to be carnally minded is what right
[1:16:16] there in your
[1:16:18] body remember hon the pel horse death
[1:16:23] everybody clear
[1:16:25] to be corally minded is
[1:16:28] death but to be spiritually manded is
[1:16:31] what that's why Paul say pay attention
[1:16:35] to the spirit to be spiritually manded
[1:16:38] is life and what if you want to be in
[1:16:41] peace pay attention to the Holy
[1:16:46] Ghost quit playing around verse seven
[1:16:50] because the cor of man mind is
[1:16:55] what is imity against who so your body
[1:17:01] is an enemy to
[1:17:07] God leave that friend that don't like
[1:17:10] you
[1:17:12] alone leave that friend that is
[1:17:14] gossiping about you
[1:17:16] alone leave that neighbor that don't
[1:17:18] like you alone deal with yourself
[1:17:25] leave the sister alone leave that
[1:17:27] brother alone deal with
[1:17:32] yourself it is a time to stop watching
[1:17:36] what is in
[1:17:37] Tennessee what is in Texas what is in
[1:17:41] Philadelphia what happened to the
[1:17:43] churches in Europe what happened to the
[1:17:45] churches in Africa all the time message
[1:17:48] believer become like
[1:17:50] CNN they know what happen in every
[1:17:53] churches
[1:17:55] looking at the other churches they are
[1:17:58] local churches worry about your own
[1:18:04] church did you he over there brother so
[1:18:07] and so did this did you he in Canada
[1:18:09] brother so and so did this did you he in
[1:18:11] Africa did you he in Florida leave
[1:18:14] Florida
[1:18:18] alone
[1:18:20] hallelujah praise the name of the
[1:18:22] Lord because the corner mind verse 7 is
[1:18:27] imity against God for it is not subject
[1:18:31] to the law of what don't try to make
[1:18:34] your
[1:18:35] body
[1:18:40] Christian amen neither indeed can be you
[1:18:45] won't be able to do that I'm going to
[1:18:47] draw a
[1:18:48] point so then they that are in the flesh
[1:18:52] cannot do what
[1:18:55] so watch what you doing in your life if
[1:18:58] it's carnal you're not pleasing God
[1:19:00] automatically because you are feeding
[1:19:02] the the the black dog everybody clear
[1:19:06] verse n but you are not in the
[1:19:11] flesh but in the spirit if so be that
[1:19:16] the spirit of God dwell in you in other
[1:19:17] words if you have the Holy Spirit just
[1:19:20] remember you live by the Holy Ghost in
[1:19:22] case you have the Holy Ghost if you
[1:19:24] don't don't have it you better find it
[1:19:26] because if you don't have the Holy
[1:19:28] Spirit automatically by default you're
[1:19:30] going to be overcome you can try and try
[1:19:33] you're going to fail you try you try
[1:19:35] you're going to fail you try you try
[1:19:36] you're going to fail you need a higher
[1:19:38] power everybody clear praise the name of
[1:19:41] the Lord now if any man have not the
[1:19:44] spirit of Christ he is none of his and
[1:19:48] if Christ be in you the body is what
[1:19:52] because of what your enemy everybody
[1:19:55] there but the spirit is life because of
[1:19:58] what jum to verse
[1:20:02] 23 everybody there and not only they
[1:20:06] talking about nature but ourself also
[1:20:10] which have the first fruit of the spirit
[1:20:13] we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:20:16] even we ourself grown
[1:20:18] what inside ourself waiting for the the
[1:20:23] adoption to do what that is the
[1:20:25] Redemption of our so now Paul is
[1:20:29] explaining to us clearly that the Inside
[1:20:32] Man is already
[1:20:34] redeemed when you have the baptism of
[1:20:38] the Holy Spirit the work of God on your
[1:20:41] inside is finished that's why you are
[1:20:44] seal until the day of your Redemption
[1:20:49] finish eternally still but your body is
[1:20:53] not finished yet
[1:20:55] amen everybody there you are waiting for
[1:20:58] the spirit to reap the adoption once you
[1:21:03] are adopted we already talk about
[1:21:05] adoption then this adoption will bring
[1:21:09] this body to be changed and to be like
[1:21:14] him everybody clear so the work of
[1:21:18] Calvary never finish Redemption Calvary
[1:21:22] started Redemption and the work of
[1:21:25] Calvary is opening the way for the Holy
[1:21:28] Spirit to enter into you but you need
[1:21:31] sunset
[1:21:33] [Music]
[1:21:36] Mountain to bring the Rapture to bring
[1:21:39] you into a second Ministry that is going
[1:21:42] to deal with this
[1:21:45] amalekite everybody clear brother
[1:21:49] Bram the flesh thirst to satisfy the
[1:21:53] desire that is in the body and the
[1:21:56] spirit desires for the things that is in
[1:21:59] the soul you see the two now desire is
[1:22:04] and many times this were War one against
[1:22:09] the you got everything in the scripture
[1:22:12] now we going through the through the
[1:22:13] message we find there what is a great
[1:22:17] trouble today that too many people try
[1:22:21] to live between those two as long as you
[1:22:24] don't understand what I'm telling you
[1:22:26] you're going to be confused you're going
[1:22:29] to be mad about yourself you're going to
[1:22:31] call yourself
[1:22:33] stupid have you seen people calling
[1:22:35] themselves stupid you do something and
[1:22:37] you say I'm stupid I'm stupid I'm stupid
[1:22:40] because you don't understand what is
[1:22:41] going
[1:22:42] on Amen you are not stupid it is sin
[1:22:47] that is
[1:22:48] stupid amen for one of them desire the
[1:22:52] things of the Earth the body
[1:22:55] the other desire the things of what like
[1:22:58] Paul says describe in Romans 7:21 when I
[1:23:02] will do good then evil is n present when
[1:23:07] you try did you ever have that in
[1:23:10] experience Christians he's talking to
[1:23:14] Christians everybody clear okay that
[1:23:18] when you are trying to do something that
[1:23:20] is worthwhile go to make an effort to do
[1:23:24] something that is good then you find out
[1:23:27] that there is the devil on every hand
[1:23:31] just to upset you everything that is one
[1:23:35] good thing
[1:23:37] that everybody clear you want to do
[1:23:40] something good and the devil is still
[1:23:42] blocking you want to go see a sister and
[1:23:44] someone is telling you no she doesn't
[1:23:47] shake your hand why are you going to go
[1:23:49] sit
[1:23:50] there amen it is not you
[1:23:55] everybody clear that is not you that is
[1:23:58] the devil in your
[1:24:00] flesh everybody
[1:24:02] clear that is one good thing I like to
[1:24:06] say this that the Christian might know
[1:24:08] when you are starting to do something
[1:24:11] and there is something always trying to
[1:24:15] upset you in doing it do it
[1:24:21] anyhow don't shake that sister hand go
[1:24:24] shake a
[1:24:26] hand don't talk to the brother that is
[1:24:29] the time you need to talk to the
[1:24:32] brother don't invite them that is the
[1:24:35] time to invite
[1:24:38] them Hallelujah do it anyhow that is the
[1:24:44] that is the devil there trying to keep
[1:24:46] you from doing what is
[1:24:48] what so every time you want to do
[1:24:51] something that is good just know you
[1:24:53] have an enemy there working with you
[1:24:55] because in the body there is a law
[1:24:57] everybody clear brother Bram say we are
[1:25:00] both natural and supernal this body is
[1:25:03] subject to death and was brought forth
[1:25:06] by a woman not by nothing but through
[1:25:10] not by God you are a r production from
[1:25:12] Adam and Eve be black white or whatever
[1:25:15] you are you are a production and off
[1:25:18] swing from Adam and Eve that makes your
[1:25:21] body born in what shape in iniquity
[1:25:25] coming to the word speaking what by
[1:25:28] default you already in trouble that's
[1:25:31] why you must be born again everybody

[1:25:38] beginning of your life as a baby already
[1:25:41] condemned not even without a chance now
[1:25:47] because the spirit that you have come to
[1:25:50] you by nature and by Nature coming from
[1:25:52] a sexual intercourse desire man and

[1:29:06] the everybody clear praise the name of
[1:29:09] the Lord we talk about the three stages
[1:29:12] of the reformer the face of a man Luther
[1:29:15] Wesley on down to the Pentecostal
[1:29:18] everybody clear so far let's go now to
[1:29:20] Esther chapter 5
[1:29:25] that was just our intro now let's get to
[1:29:28] what we need to
[1:29:31] know if you there you can say
[1:29:36] Amen last week we finished chapter 4 now
[1:29:39] it's chapter 5 we're making a point your
[1:29:42] enemy is not outside your enemy is with
[1:29:46] you when you go to church you take him
[1:29:49] when you go to the presence of the king
[1:29:51] you must take him also amen
[1:29:54] verse one now it came to pass on the
[1:29:58] third day we already explained to you
[1:29:59] third day last week everybody clear on
[1:30:02] the third day that Esther put on her
[1:30:05] royal apparel we already explained to
[1:30:06] you last week what that Royal apparel
[1:30:09] was and stood in the inner Court the
[1:30:11] holy of holiest of the King's house
[1:30:15] opposite the King's house and the King
[1:30:17] sat upon his Royal throne in the Royal
[1:30:20] House opposite the Gate of the house
[1:30:21] everybody clear so far
[1:30:24] and it was so when the king saw Esther
[1:30:27] the queen standing in the court that she
[1:30:30] obtained favor Esther is coming on the
[1:30:33] first
[1:30:34] day second day on the third day on the
[1:30:38] justification we explain you
[1:30:40] sanctification now we in laia the
[1:30:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost everybody
[1:30:46] clear no all ordinarily we thought it
[1:30:49] was three days then the fourth day it
[1:30:51] didn't happen that way amen we are on
[1:30:53] the third day
[1:30:54] and the King held out to Esther the
[1:30:57] golden scepter we already explained this
[1:30:59] that was in his hand so Esther Drew n
[1:31:02] and touched the top of the scepter verse
[1:31:05] three then said the king to her what
[1:31:09] will
[1:31:11] you so there is a will
[1:31:15] here or a
[1:31:18] want everybody
[1:31:20] clear what will you Queen Esther
[1:31:24] and what is your request your want your
[1:31:27] will it shall be given to you to the
[1:31:31] half of
[1:31:33] the so the king as soon as Esther
[1:31:37] approached him he automatically
[1:31:39] presented two things he said either you
[1:31:44] can take the wheel or you can ask
[1:31:47] whatever you want up to the half not the
[1:31:52] full the half
[1:31:54] of the
[1:31:55] Kingdom everybody clear the first thing
[1:31:58] is the will the second thing is the
[1:32:04] kingdom she's calling Jesus on the cross
[1:32:07] and everything we already know that we
[1:32:09] in the Pentecostal
[1:32:11] age in Luke 11:2 save your time here the
[1:32:16] Bible says and he says unto them when ye
[1:32:20] pray say Our Father which are in
[1:32:24] H be th thy what everybody
[1:32:29] clear everybody
[1:32:31] clear Kingdom thy kingdom come thy
[1:32:37] what everybody clear are we okay now th
[1:32:41] will be
[1:32:43] done as in heaven so in
[1:32:47] what amen so Jesus when he was talking
[1:32:51] to his disciple he said when you pray
[1:32:55] always ask for the will and the kingdom
[1:32:58] of God and when Queen Esther is
[1:33:01] approaching the king the king
[1:33:04] automatically presented the two things
[1:33:07] what do you will and what do you want up
[1:33:10] to the kingdom I have the will and I
[1:33:13] have the kingdom Jesus say ask the will
[1:33:15] and the kingdom but not your will but
[1:33:19] the will of the father
[1:33:24] in 1 John
[1:33:27] 5:14 the Bible say and this is the
[1:33:30] confidence that we have in him that if
[1:33:33] we ask
[1:33:34] what according to
[1:33:37] what when you are asking something
[1:33:40] according to the will of God it is no
[1:33:43] more your
[1:33:46] will it is now the will of
[1:33:50] God
[1:33:52] hallelujah if we ask anything according
[1:33:56] to his will he does what that's why it's
[1:33:59] important to know your Bible it is
[1:34:02] important for you to read the word so
[1:34:06] when you ask God you always must couple
[1:34:09] your request with a promise you bring a
[1:34:13] promise to God you say it is written
[1:34:16] this is why I'm asking when you take
[1:34:19] your request and you put it in the word
[1:34:23] and you present presented to God it is
[1:34:25] no more your request it becomes God's
[1:34:31] word Ephesian chapter one why is that
[1:34:34] important in whom also we have obtained
[1:34:38] an inheritance being what
[1:34:41] predestinated according to
[1:34:43] what the purpose of him who does what
[1:34:48] work of all
[1:34:50] things everything after in other word
[1:34:54] ACC coding after the Cel of
[1:34:59] what amen so when it's the will of God
[1:35:03] God will do everything he can to fulfill
[1:35:06] his
[1:35:07] will amen so just make sure what you
[1:35:11] desire in your life it is according to
[1:35:14] the word of God if what you need in your
[1:35:17] life is according to the word of God so
[1:35:20] now it's notal because if it's his word
[1:35:23] God will never let his word return to
[1:35:26] him void when the word is released he
[1:35:29] will fulfill that with which he was sent
[1:35:32] to be accomplished everybody clear so
[1:35:35] far I read this and I'm going to read it
[1:35:37] again I wonder if we are sufficiently
[1:35:40] impressed with the word in our midst let
[1:35:43] me give you a thought here how do we
[1:35:46] pray we pray in Jesus name don't we
[1:35:49] every prayer is in his name or there is
[1:35:53] not any answer because it's not
[1:35:55] according to his will he said whatever
[1:35:57] you pray in my name so when you pray in
[1:36:00] his name you don't pray in his name no
[1:36:02] answer guaranteed 1 John 5:14 this is
[1:36:07] the confidence that we have we just read
[1:36:08] it that if we ask according to his will
[1:36:11] he hear us and if we know that he hear
[1:36:14] us whatsoever we ask we know that we
[1:36:17] have the petition that we desire of him
[1:36:20] now we ask what is the will of God
[1:36:24] God there is only one way to know his
[1:36:28] will and that is by the word of God the
[1:36:32] word of God is the will of God make sure
[1:36:36] whatever you ask ask it according to the
[1:36:39] will of God if God say ask red you don't
[1:36:44] bring him yellow he's not going to get
[1:36:46] it if God say bring me purple you don't
[1:36:50] give him blue if you align your we with
[1:36:54] purple God will automatically Grant his
[1:36:57] request which is your word everybody
[1:37:01] clear praise the name of the Lord
[1:37:05] hallelujah after that we found out that
[1:37:08] not only is the will but half of the
[1:37:10] Kingdom why half we know that Esther was
[1:37:14] married to the king and as being married
[1:37:18] to the king they are joined her
[1:37:21] together the Bible says in Romans CH 8:1
[1:37:24] 17 and if children then hair we have an
[1:37:28] inheritance hairs of God and what Jo H
[1:37:33] with who that's why we need a half of
[1:37:36] the
[1:37:40] Kingdom you see when you teach those
[1:37:43] stuff people in the message are so
[1:37:45] afraid to take God at his
[1:37:47] word what was in God he ped that in who
[1:37:54] can you say Amen what was in ch he P
[1:37:57] that in
[1:38:02] who let me help you
[1:38:05] again I know we we
[1:38:08] getting deep water there when God
[1:38:11] created
[1:38:13] man he created man in
[1:38:16] what his image okay so the man that came
[1:38:21] out was in the image of God everybody
[1:38:24] clear you ready but we found out that
[1:38:28] man when he came out he came out male
[1:38:31] and
[1:38:35] female so the image of God is
[1:38:42] what everybody clear can I repeat it
[1:38:45] again Man was created in the image of
[1:38:50] God God is God is a spirit according to
[1:38:54] John 4:21 amen when God created the
[1:38:58] spirit man he was creating something
[1:39:01] brother Bram say that which he was
[1:39:03] creating look exactly like the Creator
[1:39:07] himself so when he created it instead of
[1:39:12] that Adam comes and being a man because
[1:39:15] God is a man the one who came is Adam
[1:39:18] and
[1:39:22] Eve so God is not complete without you
[1:39:28] amen amen are you there so what God did
[1:39:33] in Genesis 2 he just picked Adam
[1:39:36] everybody close anybody understand me
[1:39:39] and built the body for Adam and pull the
[1:39:43] spirit of Adam and put it in the body
[1:39:46] amen amen then he begin to create
[1:39:50] animals when he create them m female
[1:39:54] male female male female that's why he
[1:39:58] turned around he said it is not
[1:40:01] good for Adam to be what because Adam
[1:40:05] was already
[1:40:08] [Music]
[1:40:10] double everybody clear now to bring Eve
[1:40:14] out of Adam he put Adam to what and he
[1:40:19] he perform a surgery and he pull a by
[1:40:22] product
[1:40:24] and pull it and put it there when Jesus
[1:40:27] Christ came the Bible say Jesus was the
[1:40:30] second
[1:40:31] Adam are you there so when Jesus was
[1:40:35] walking somebody was inside
[1:40:40] [Music]
[1:40:40] [Applause]
[1:40:42] Jesus amen when Jesus was resisting the
[1:40:46] devil you are inside Jesus
[1:40:52] [Music]
[1:40:53] when Jesus was walking upon the Water
[1:40:56] you are walking upon the Water that's
[1:40:59] why Jesus said the work that I do you
[1:41:03] can do it also and matter of fact you
[1:41:06] can do
[1:41:08] [Applause]
[1:41:11] even
[1:41:13] Hallelujah before Christ di on the
[1:41:17] cross the bride was still there he was
[1:41:20] pregnant in other word he picked evil
[1:41:24] and when he's killing the devil chasing
[1:41:26] Devil he's showing Eve you see how I do
[1:41:29] it Hallelujah you see how I do it you
[1:41:32] see how I do it you see how I do it
[1:41:34] that's why brother brandham say when he
[1:41:37] was resisting the devil he was showing
[1:41:40] that any Christian amen if he can take
[1:41:44] God at his word in other word if you
[1:41:47] remember what he did and you do the same
[1:41:50] thing you can overcome the devil any we
[1:41:53] any place under any
[1:41:57] circumstances everybody clear and when
[1:42:00] he reached the cross what did he do he
[1:42:02] put Adam to
[1:42:04] sleep and the Roman soldier came with a
[1:42:08] sword instead of hitting the sword here
[1:42:11] he doesn't put the spe here the spirit
[1:42:13] doesn't go here the spirit goes only
[1:42:15] here
[1:42:19] hallah hallelujah do you think your me
[1:42:23] is bothering you no he's pushing you to
[1:42:26] the right place amen those trial are
[1:42:31] just pushing you to the right
[1:42:33] position when she when he took the spear
[1:42:36] and put it there what
[1:42:38] came and what why he didn't just came
[1:42:42] blood when a woman give birth what comes
[1:42:46] first and then and then Christ was
[1:42:51] giving birth like Adam
[1:42:57] are you there the bread has been born
[1:43:00] right there that's why he said it is I
[1:43:04] already showed you from beginning to the
[1:43:07] end now come out and continue my
[1:43:14] work are you
[1:43:16] there so that's why Queen Esther if I
[1:43:19] want to give it to you I'm going to give
[1:43:21] you what half
[1:43:24] it is male and female half 5050 we are
[1:43:30] joint the Bible even says that Jesus is
[1:43:34] our
[1:43:37] brother you are
[1:43:41] [Applause]
[1:43:44] God are you there when he are
[1:43:47] self-existing you are also self-existing
[1:43:51] that's right
[1:43:56] Hallelujah don't listen to the sermon in
[1:43:59] the
[1:44:00] body listen to the sermon inside here
[1:44:05] because we got to leave this earth we
[1:44:07] need a higher Faith than just a faithful

[1:49:13] bridegroom but the friend of the
[1:49:16] bridegroom there's two kind of friend
[1:49:19] John the Baptist was a good friend to
[1:49:21] the bridegroom because he was the one
[1:49:24] preparing the way but Judas was also a
[1:49:27] friend and Jesus told him is that the
[1:49:30] way you betray friend he call him a
[1:49:32] friend there was two kind of friends

[1:51:36] devil when the brde will recognize who

[2:34:55] Eden where they took Eve a rib out of
[2:34:58] Adam and made Eve from Adam's side and
[2:35:00] how the bride was brought forth on the
[2:35:04] cross I also got to thinking about how 3
