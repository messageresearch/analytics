[music] You did good, my friend. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Last Sunday, let's pick up this and we move on. WE FIND THAT JESUS SAY IN JOHN 15 that ye have what? &gt;&gt; Not chosen me. &gt;&gt; But what happened? &gt;&gt; I have chosen you &gt;&gt; and did what? &gt;&gt; Ordained you. &gt;&gt; So Jesus chosen us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And did what? &gt;&gt; Ordained us. &gt;&gt; And ordained us. &gt;&gt; Ordained us to do what? &gt;&gt; That you should bring forth fruit. &gt;&gt; That we should bring forth what? &gt;&gt; Fruit. &gt;&gt; We should bring forth fruit. And that what happened? &gt;&gt; Your fruit should remain. &gt;&gt; So we were all chosen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Number one, &gt;&gt; and orained, &gt;&gt; PREDESTINATED, &gt;&gt; FABRICATED, &gt;&gt; PREPARE. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; TO BRING FORTH WHAT? &gt;&gt; FRUIT. &gt;&gt; IF YOU LOOK, THAT FRUIT IS NOT PLURAL. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; Verify in your Bible. &gt;&gt; It is a fruit in the singular. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND WE KNOW THAT FRUIT ARE USUALLY IN THE SEED. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; WHEN WHEN YOU TAKE AN APPLE seed &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you and you plant it, it is not the water that bring the apple. &gt;&gt; Every apple is already in the seed. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO YOUR PREDESTINATED SEED HAS A FRUIT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. And this fruit JESUS SAY AND THAT YOUR FRUIT SHOULD DO WHAT? &gt;&gt; REMAIN. &gt;&gt; SO THIS IS NOT A FRUIT THAT CAN BE DESTROYED. &gt;&gt; NO SIR. &gt;&gt; IT IS AN ETERNAL FRUIT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND JESUS CONTINUE. HE SAYS WHAT? &gt;&gt; That whatsoever ye shall ask. &gt;&gt; In other word WHEN YOU BRING FORTH fruit &gt;&gt; a fruit that REMAIN &gt;&gt; ONCE THAT FRUIT IS MANIFESTED IN YOUR LIFE. WHATSOEVER YOU ASK, &gt;&gt; take your time right there. &gt;&gt; Take your time right there. &gt;&gt; THERE WILL BE A TIME IN YOUR LIFE YOU COULD NOT BRING THE FRUIT &gt;&gt; BUT THE FRUIT WAS IN YOU. &gt;&gt; AT THAT TIME WHEN YOU ASK GOD, GOD DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO GIVE YOU ALL THE TIME &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT FULLY CONVERTED TO HIM YET. &gt;&gt; THERE IS TIME. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN YOU MANIFESTED THE FRUIT, &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW LORD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU BRING FORTH THE FRUIT, &gt;&gt; GOD IS A 100% &gt;&gt; SURE THAT THIS ONE WILL GO NOWHERE. &gt;&gt; YES SIR. [cheering] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, YOU WERE MANIFESTED WHAT YOU WERE SET FOR. &gt;&gt; YES SIR. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, YOU BECOME THE [screaming] WORD. BECAUSE EVERY SEED MUST BE REPRODUCED ACCORDING TO ITS OWN KIND. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU SHALL KNOW THEM BY THEIR FRUIT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOUR TRUE IDENTITY IS MANIFESTED, &gt;&gt; GOD HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH YOUR CONFIDENCE. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; When God was giving Peter the keys, &gt;&gt; he knew the weakness OF PETER. BUT HE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THE WEAKNESS &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE KNEW PETER WILL ALWAYS COME BACK. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; THAT WILL NOT CHANGE GOD'S DECISION. &gt;&gt; SO ONCE YOU REACH THE POINT THAT YOU HAVE REPRODUCED, &gt;&gt; MANIFESTED THE FRUIT OF GOD. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? THEN FROM THAT POINT WHATSOEVER. &gt;&gt; Listen my friend. &gt;&gt; Listen my friend. This message &gt;&gt; came to bring believer to 10. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Okay sir. &gt;&gt; Since 50 60 years. &gt;&gt; We are still preaching believer to six. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE EVERYBODY IS AFRAID OF THEM. 10 SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE. &gt;&gt; FOR 50 YEARS, WE KEEP PREACHING people to six. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm going to get TO THAT &gt;&gt; IN THIS CHURCH.

[cheering] &gt;&gt; I don't KNOW IF WE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW IF WE TOGETHER. [applause] &gt;&gt; IF SOME IF SOMEBODY CAN'T CLIMB UP HIGHER, &gt;&gt; they want to block everybody &gt;&gt; to stay where they are. &gt;&gt; AND EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO GO, THEY SAY, "YOU TRYING TO SHOW OFF. &gt;&gt; YOU NO, NO, I'M NOT TRYING TO SHOW OFF. I'M NOT THE ONE WHO GAVE THE PROMISE. IF HE GAVE THE PROMISE, ME I BELIEVE NOT YOU THE PROMISE. I MUST GO BEYOND. &gt;&gt; GOD SAY 10. LET'S PREACH 10. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; WE ARE BELOW OUR PRIVILEGES. AND PENTECOSTAL COME SOMETIME [screaming] HIGHER &gt;&gt; THAN EVEN MESSAGE BELIEVERS &gt;&gt; IN THE FAITH. &gt;&gt; MESSAGE BELIEVER WANT TO SIT AND LISTEN TO THE testimonies [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; in 1956.

HOW DID WE BUILD THIS BREATHING? &gt;&gt; A CHURCH WITH FIVE FIVE FIVE YEARS CAN GET A CREDIT IN THE BANK. &gt;&gt; WHERE IS THE MONEY COMING FROM? From the world of the impossible. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; IT'S CHALLENGING THE BANKER. [cheering] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU NEED TO FORGET ABOUT THIS PIECE RIGHT HERE. &gt;&gt; THIS REASONING OF A BRAND.

Whether it didn't help, whether it didn't work the first time or not, &gt;&gt; me today, I'm repeating again. WHATSOEVER [cheering] &gt;&gt; WHATSOEVER YOU SHALL DO. &gt;&gt; ASK OF the father. &gt;&gt; Ask who? &gt;&gt; The father. &gt;&gt; IF YOU ARE ASKING THE FATHER, WHO ARE YOU? &gt;&gt; THE SON. &gt;&gt; ASK THE FATHER. IN WHICH NAME? &gt;&gt; IN MY NAME. &gt;&gt; IF YOU ARE ASKING, &gt;&gt; LET ME LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION. LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION. If I tell you &gt;&gt; go to my office tomorrow &gt;&gt; and tell the manager, &gt;&gt; tell my manager &gt;&gt; to give you this and this &gt;&gt; when you are presenting them, do you present in your name? &gt;&gt; What do you say? &gt;&gt; Brother Steven say WHEN YOU WHEN YOU SAY DR. SHEAMBO SAY &gt;&gt; MY MANAGER CHANGES. &gt;&gt; What did he say? Give me this. THEY JUST TAKE THEY GIVE IT TO YOU NOT BECAUSE OF YOU BECAUSE OF THE NAME OF DR. SH.

[applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE JESUS CHOSE YOU &gt;&gt; AND ORDAINED YOU. &gt;&gt; THEREFORE, YOU CAN USE HIS NAME. [cheering] &gt;&gt; HE HAS CONFIDENCE. [applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; HE SAYS IF YOU ASK WHATSOEVER YOU ASK THE FATHER WHY &gt;&gt; IN MY NAME &gt;&gt; I WILL DO WHAT? &gt;&gt; He may give it to you. &gt;&gt; He will get HE MAY GIVE. GOD WILL GIVE IT TO YOU. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? WHY? BECAUSE [screaming] GOD CHOSE you &gt;&gt; and God ordained you. &gt;&gt; AND WE FOUND OUT THAT CHOOSING SOME PEOPLE ARE CHOSEN. &gt;&gt; YES, THEY ARE. &gt;&gt; BUT NOT TO BRING FRUIT. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; WE FOUND JUDAS WAS CHOSEN. &gt;&gt; HE WAS CHOSEN AMONG THE 12. &gt;&gt; BUT HE WAS A DEVIL. ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE WAS THE SON OF &gt;&gt; PREDITION. &gt;&gt; HE CANNOT CALL GOD HIS FATHER. &gt;&gt; NO SIR. &gt;&gt; NO SIR. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE CAME FROM HELL. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; PREDITION means hell. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AND JESUS SAID, "I CHOSE YOU ALL OF you &gt;&gt; but one of you is what?" &gt;&gt; That was in John 6. &gt;&gt; WE KNOW BY JOHN 13, JUDAH LEFT. &gt;&gt; And once Judah left, Jesus changed the language. &gt;&gt; He said, "Who staying here? There is no more child of the devil. They all gone from the message. Okay. Now I need to change the language. Now let me bring another ministry &gt;&gt; that WILL BEGIN TO UNFOLD TO THEM who they are. &gt;&gt; WHEN EVERYBODY WHEN THE PARASITES ARE GONE. &gt;&gt; YES SIR. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; He say you I have chosen you. &gt;&gt; I ALREADY CHOSE YOU THE FIRST TIME BUT THIS TIME I'M REVEALING TO you something. I chose you and I ordain YOU TO BRING FORTH FRUIT. ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE FRUIT? BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY WHAT IS THE FRUIT? THE FRUIT IS WHAT? &gt;&gt; THE WORD. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE WORD HAVE EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT ARE IN THE WORD. &gt;&gt; THE WORD. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS WHAT IS THE FRUIT IS WHAT? &gt;&gt; THE WORD. &gt;&gt; THE FRUIT FOR WHAT? &gt;&gt; THE SEASON. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT JUST THE WORD. THE WORD OF THE SEASON. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AH THAT IS WHAT IT IS. THE WHAT &gt;&gt; TEACHING. THE TEACHING OF WHAT? &gt;&gt; I didn't write this quote. &gt;&gt; Did brother Brandham say they're preaching? [cheering] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You saying that because you a teacher? Of course. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I DON'T HAVE TIME TO BE HUMBLE. HUMBLE. HUMBLE. Of course. &gt;&gt; There is a reason why I'M A TEACHER. BECAUSE SOMEBODY NEED TO HEAR THE TEACHING OF the season, THE TEACHING OF MALACHI 4, REVELATION 10, THE TEACHING OF THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY YOU CANNOT HAVE FAITH CORRECTLY IF YOU ARE NOT CORRECTLY TAUGHT. &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY A CHURCH CAN NEVER GO HIGHER THAN THE TEACHING, &gt;&gt; NOT THE PREACHING, THE TEACHING OF IT PASTOR. THE TEACHING OF WATER &gt;&gt; of the season. THE TEACHING OF WHAT &gt;&gt; NOT ANY TYPE OF TEACHING. &gt;&gt; WE NEED TO see who YOUR TEACHING IS. YOUR TEACHING MUST BE ACCORDING TO MALACHI 4. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY WHEN WE TEACH WE SAY BROTHER SAY WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE YOUR TEACHING ARE COMING FROM. WE NEED TO KNOW THE ORIGIN OF THE TEACHING &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO PRODUCE THAT TEACHING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You were chosen and you were ordained to bring forth the fruit. In other words, to bring forth the word. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; What I'm saying here, &gt;&gt; you see the message? Yeah. &gt;&gt; The message, &gt;&gt; the message should not struggle with you. &gt;&gt; The living of the message for you, it's automatic. &gt;&gt; Because you were ordained for it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If you a woman, &gt;&gt; do you when you are growing up, do you tell your body change to a woman? &gt;&gt; Change to a woman. Now it's time for you to see your your your sac. Remember body &gt;&gt; when you are even eating I mean whatever I mean fruit or whatever your body knows what it's doing &gt;&gt; because your body knows that this is a woman. &gt;&gt; You can become a man and your body still know that you a woman. &gt;&gt; Your body already know that you a woman. YOU WON'T CHEAT THAT BODY BECAUSE YOUR BODY WAS ORDAINED AND CHOSEN TO BE A WOMAN. YOU WERE ORDAINED AND CHOSEN TO BE THE BRIDE. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, YOUR SOUL KNOWS WHO YOU ARE. [cheering] &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T STRUGGLE WITH THE MESSAGE. YOU DON'T WRESTLE WITH THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; ARE we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. YOU MIGHT EVEN TRY AND A CERTAIN POINT YOU JUST LET GO BECAUSE IT'S NOT YOU LETTING YOU GO. NO, YOUR BODY is working. &gt;&gt; Amen. You were ordained and you were predestinated. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; BUT IF YOU NOTICE, JUDAH NEVER MADE IT TO THE PENTECOST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; HE NEVER MADE IT TO THE UPPER ROOM. &gt;&gt; HE DIED [screaming] WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST. BUT YET HE SERVED GOD &gt;&gt; TO A CERTAIN POINT. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU AND OTHER PEOPLE, OTHER PEOPLE WILL SERVE GOD TO A CERTAIN POINT. [cheering] &gt;&gt; SOME SOME PEOPLE SERVE GOD WHEN THEY PLATEAU. THEY LEFT THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; SOME DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; THEY ARE STILL AROUND THE MESSAGE PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; BUT IF YOU GET ALONG WITH THEM, THEY DON'T PUSH. &gt;&gt; THEY CANNOT MOVE. &gt;&gt; THEY ALREADY PLATEAU. &gt;&gt; THEY ARE IN A RELIGIOUS MODE. &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T STRIVE TO SEE MORE GOD IN [screaming] THEIR LIVES. &gt;&gt; THEY ARE COMFORTABLE. [applause] ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; Are we together SIR? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? SO SOME PEOPLE SERVE GOD TO A CERTAIN POINT &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN TO REACH THE CLIMATE THEY WILL NEVER REACH IT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE BIBLE SAY HAVE WE NOW PROPHESY &gt;&gt; THEY WERE PROPHESYING. &gt;&gt; HAVE WE NOT CAST OUT DEVIL? &gt;&gt; THEY WERE CASTING OUT DEVIL. AND JESUS TURN SAY I NEVER KNEW YOU. AND THE PROPHECY IS THE SECOND POOL. &gt;&gt; CUZ THAT DEVIL IS THE FIRST POOL. &gt;&gt; BUT THE THIRD POOL, THEY CANNOT REACH IT. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; SO AMONG [screaming] THE SERVANT OF GOD, AMONG THE DISCIPLE OF GOD, THERE ARE TWO CATEGORIES. &gt;&gt; THERE ARE SOME THAT WILL GO ALL THE WAY AND PRODUCE FRUIT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND THERE ARE SOME THAT WILL GO AT A CERTAIN LEVEL AND THEY BLOCK BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT ORDAINED. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THIS MESSAGE IS NOT A GROUP REVELATION. &gt;&gt; IT IS AN INDIVIDUAL REVELATION. [cheering] &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD [screaming] OPEN UP, MOVE FORWARD. &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE. I DON'T KNOW IF [screaming] YOU ARE ORDAINED TO PRODUCE WHAT GOD TOLD ME TO PRODUCE. [applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we clear so far? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We clear so far. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to the parable of the mana &gt;&gt; of the panda. &gt;&gt; [music]
