[54:21] and
[54:24] honey and God refused to be with them
[54:27] amen
[54:35] [Music]
[54:42] amen because God said for I will not go
[54:45] up into I will not go up in the midst of
[54:48] thee for thou art a stiff neck people
[54:51] lest I consume thee in the way
[54:56] because the people of God found
[54:58] themselves in sin amen
[55:01] amen
[55:03] see here just in a
[55:06] minute we
[55:09] read we can build our subject of this
[55:20] evening we'll take Joshua chap 3 verse
[55:24] 11-13 first
[55:31] may God be
[55:41] worshiped it's written like
[55:49] this behold the Ark of the Covenant of
[55:52] the Lord of all the Earth passes over
[55:55] before you
[55:56] into
[56:04] Jordan now therefore take you 12 men out
[56:08] of the tribes of Israel out of every
[56:11] tribe a man
[56:31] and and it shall come to pass as soon as
[56:34] the souls of the feet of the priests
[56:37] that bear the Ark of the Lord the Lord
[56:39] of all the Earth shall rest in the
[56:41] waters of Jordan that the Waters of
[56:44] Jordan shall be cut off from the waters
[56:47] that come down from above and they shall
[56:50] stand upon a HP
[57:02] over here the Ark of the Lord represents
[57:04] the presence of God in in the people's
[57:08] midst amen amen
[57:13] H when you have the presence of
[57:17] God in front of what any type of
[57:22] Trials the trials will back away amen
[57:29] why because there's the presence of
[57:38] God and that's what we'll be talking
[57:39] about is the influence of the presence
[57:41] of God in a man amen
[57:48] amen and this presence of God will see
[57:51] it in two manners
[57:59] the presence of God can be in someone's
[58:01] life and man is praying but nothing has
[58:03] happening God is not
[58:10] answering you can go up to the mountains
[58:12] and pray you can make you can do a lot
[58:13] of fasting and praying and God is not
[58:16] answering
[58:19] amen that's what we'll see this evening
[58:22] pay attention
[58:27] I read in Joshua chapter
[58:31] 7 I will read something
[58:38] there I will jump a little because we
[58:40] don't have enough
[58:45] time I will start from verse
[58:53] six I'll start from the first verse
[59:04] but the children of Israel committed a
[59:07] trespass in the in the accursed
[59:24] thing for the son of Ki and the son of
[59:28] zabdi and the son of Zarah this of the
[59:31] tribe of Judah took of the accursed
[59:33] thing and the anger of the Lord was
[59:36] kindled against the children of
[59:43] Israel and the man of a smoke of them
[59:47] about 30 and6 men
[1:00:02] for they chased them from before the
[1:00:05] gate even onto sheim and smoke them in
[1:00:08] the going down where wherefore the
[1:00:11] hearts of the people melted and became
[1:00:14] as
[1:00:17] water I'm jumping over
[1:00:22] here we read somewhere Joshua was
[1:00:25] telling to the
[1:00:31] that the people of God will be
[1:00:34] behind and he took the priest and the
[1:00:38] Asians they took the Ark of the
[1:00:43] Lord and he told them we're faced with
[1:00:48] Jordan we're in front of a
[1:00:51] trial you will walk before the people
[1:00:56] when you will pass when your feet will
[1:00:58] go the water and the water will
[1:01:02] separate to all to allow the people of
[1:01:05] God to walk in dry
[1:01:09] grounds and that's what they
[1:01:14] did the presence of God was there active
[1:01:20] amen that's why when the
[1:01:24] priest when they
[1:01:27] started when they started placing their
[1:01:29] foot on the
[1:01:31] water the Jordan was
[1:01:36] separating and the people walked on dry
[1:01:41] ground why because they had the presence
[1:01:43] of
[1:01:44] God which was active
[1:01:52] AC but now look again the same story in
[1:01:57] there were a small
[1:02:02] country Joshua sent a man to do a
[1:02:07] scouting and when the people of God
[1:02:10] came they said it's a small
[1:02:17] nation we don't need to take our whole
[1:02:19] nation to go com
[1:02:22] get we only take 2,000 or three thousand
[1:02:26] to go take this small
[1:02:29] nation and Joshua accepted
[1:02:34] that but you notice when we read in
[1:02:36] verse
[1:02:43] five and the of of them about 30 and six
[1:02:48] men that slew
[1:02:51] 36 and the people lost faith
[1:02:56] but in verse
[1:02:58] six
[1:03:00] JHU and Joshua rent his
[1:03:06] clothes and fell to and fell and fell to
[1:03:10] the Earth upon his face before the Ark
[1:03:13] of the Lord until
[1:03:22] the he and the Elders of Israel and put
[1:03:26] upon their
[1:03:30] heads here Joshua before the ark before
[1:03:34] the he recognized
[1:03:37] the he recognized this the
[1:03:41] error he noticed that God did not react
[1:03:44] in his life like in your
[1:03:46] life you you might be praying you might
[1:03:50] be asking whatever you're asking
[1:03:53] for you ask for inter intercession here
[1:03:57] and you can ask for
[1:04:00] prophets for your
[1:04:02] case they will
[1:04:04] pray and there's no
[1:04:07] solution
[1:04:09] why because there was something that was
[1:04:11] not right
[1:04:13] somewhere and the man of God understood
[1:04:16] he took the
[1:04:18] elders even rent his
[1:04:21] clothes and they started praying
[1:04:25] Joshua has
[1:04:28] said alas oh
[1:04:32] Lord wherefore has th at all brought
[1:04:35] this
[1:04:37] before over Jordan to deliver us the
[1:04:40] hand of amorites to
[1:04:45] destroy would to God we had been content
[1:04:49] and dwelt on the other side Jordan
[1:04:58] oh Lord what shall I say when Israel
[1:05:00] turneth their backs before their
[1:05:04] enemies I will look at verse
[1:05:13] 10
[1:05:16] the th upon thy
[1:05:20] face one
[1:05:22] thing they made it and they kill the
[1:05:27] people but look at one
[1:05:30] element prayer of
[1:05:34] Joshua activated the presence of
[1:05:38] God and God had came
[1:05:41] down to solve to look at the um problem
[1:05:45] to reveal the Sol the
[1:05:49] problem in verse
[1:05:53] 11 God said Israel have
[1:06:00] sinned they have also transgressed my
[1:06:04] have commanded
[1:06:07] themen of the accursed
[1:06:11] thing and they have also
[1:06:15] stolen also and they have put even among
[1:06:20] their own
[1:06:22] stuff you understand you understood one
[1:06:25] element
[1:06:27] may God be
[1:06:34] praised and in that instant the children
[1:06:36] of Israel could not win the war win the
[1:06:40] battle as long as Sin is within
[1:06:44] you you will not
[1:06:50] win we seen with the
[1:06:53] pastor Isaiah
[1:06:59] 59 Isaiah 59 1
[1:07:03] [Music]
[1:07:05] to then we'll return to Joshua Isaiah
[1:07:12] 59 I'll read a little
[1:07:18] something and there what did God say
[1:07:27] behold the Lord's hand is not shortened
[1:07:29] that he
[1:07:34] cannot neither his ears heavy that he
[1:07:37] cannot hear but
[1:07:39] your your iniquities have
[1:07:42] se but it's your sin that
[1:07:48] has but your iniquities have separated
[1:07:51] between you and your God and your sins
[1:07:53] have hid his face from you
[1:07:56] that ye that he will not
[1:08:00] hear for your hands are defiled with
[1:08:04] blood and your fingers with iniquities
[1:08:07] and your lips have spoken lies your
[1:08:09] tongue have have moded
[1:08:13] perverse
[1:08:19] perverseness you see that the presence
[1:08:21] of God was passive
[1:08:25] because there were
[1:08:28] sin and verse 13
[1:08:33] listen God is giving
[1:08:35] [Music]
[1:08:37] order he said Joshua stand
[1:08:41] upan sanctify the people
[1:09:16] and he said verse 13 said up sanctify
[1:09:20] the people and say sanctify yourself
[1:09:22] against tomorrow for thus say the Lord
[1:09:25] God of Israel there is an accursed thing
[1:09:28] in the midst of thee oh Israel thou can
[1:09:32] not stand before thy enemies until you
[1:09:35] take away the accursed thing from among
[1:09:38] you that's
[1:09:45] right before you do
[1:09:48] anything sanctify the
[1:09:52] people and then they call the people
[1:09:57] every tribe based on the
[1:09:59] family to
[1:10:02] detect to detect who had
[1:10:08] sinned because the one that has sinned
[1:10:11] went ah H
[1:10:14] thems the sin of of an individual in a
[1:10:21] church block the manifestation the
[1:10:23] Divine manifestation of God the
[1:10:27] church blocked the healing of God in the
[1:10:31] church all it takes is one
[1:10:34] person aen was one
[1:10:38] person 36 men were dead because of
[1:10:43] him Israel um committed a defect because
[1:10:47] of
[1:10:48] him because of
[1:10:52] sin and when they made a call for all
[1:10:55] the
[1:10:57] people God was making every family
[1:11:02] pass the family of
[1:11:05] of of
[1:11:08] everybody when he came to the family of
[1:11:12] Judah now they're taking each
[1:11:16] family they arrive to the family
[1:11:19] of and they ask
[1:11:24] a son
[1:11:33] and Joshua said unto aen my son give I
[1:11:37] pray thee glory to the Lord God of
[1:11:39] Israel and make confession unto him and
[1:11:42] tell and tell me now what thou Hast done
[1:11:46] hide it not from me
[1:12:19] first 20 to 21 and aen answered Joshua
[1:12:22] and said indeed I have sinned against
[1:12:24] the Lord God of Israel and thus and thus
[1:12:27] have I done when I saw among the spoil
[1:12:31] the spoils a goodly babylonish garment
[1:12:34] and 200 shekele of silver and a wedge of
[1:12:38] gold of 50 shekels we then I covered
[1:12:42] them and took them and behold they are
[1:12:45] HID in the earth in the midst of my tent
[1:12:48] and the silver under it
[1:12:56] and you see just because of one
[1:12:59] person the family did not
[1:13:02] Advance the church did not
[1:13:05] Advance the nation did not
[1:13:09] advance until God
[1:13:13] spoke and when they removed
[1:13:16] a they took everything that he had and
[1:13:19] then they killed
[1:13:23] him that's how Israel
[1:13:26] went and um conquered the small
[1:13:31] nation the prophet
[1:13:35] says the prophe say
[1:13:38] in give me a
[1:13:46] sec in a bling prophet in paragraph 1

[1:15:40] read looking at uncensored programs
[1:15:44] listening to Hollywood's dirty jokes
[1:15:46] listening to old Boogie woggie music of
[1:15:49] the de of the devil that's hatched out
[1:15:53] that's hatched out from men that's of
[1:15:55] ill of ill Fame and God V and God V
[1:16:00] conscience conss the devil's influence
[1:16:03] to inspire The Works of the devil
[1:16:08] on paragraph
[1:16:38] in paragraph 108 says oh God I'm ashame
[1:16:41] of myself for not rebuking in the way
[1:16:43] that I should oh God take away my guilt
[1:16:46] I ask you to do it I ask you to forgive
[1:16:49] these people that forgive these people
[1:16:53] that's here first us all even me behind
[1:16:56] the pulpit help us to raise from this
[1:17:00] from this altar as new men and woman
[1:17:03] help us to go from here as Christians
[1:17:07] ought to
[1:17:12] go read in Joshua 7 verse
[1:17:20] 6 and the verse 13
[1:17:32] we saw two element that had activated
[1:17:34] the presence of
[1:17:37] God that rendered the presence of God
[1:17:41] active it was the prayer of
[1:17:44] Joshua who humbled himself not by
[1:17:49] arrogance he had humbled himself before
[1:17:53] God
[1:18:00] when you're TR when you're going through
[1:18:02] certain um moments or certain
[1:18:07] trials and that you humble yourself from
[1:18:09] all your
[1:18:11] heart you humble yourself you lower
[1:18:14] yourself with from all your
[1:18:17] heart God will
[1:18:20] listen and he will activate his presence
[1:18:25] and we saw the second
[1:18:27] element that activates the presence of
[1:18:30] God it's a Sanctified
[1:18:35] life see the prophet where he
[1:18:40] saying speaking of an influence of
[1:18:45] another he says
[1:18:48] this you can see examp
[1:18:52] maybe a woman
[1:19:00] maybe she's meeting with her other um
[1:19:05] girlfriends maybe they're
[1:19:08] single maybe they're
[1:19:14] married now her in herself she had taken
[1:19:16] a
[1:19:18] decision that me for
[1:19:23] example person who will touch my body is
[1:19:26] the person that will honor
[1:19:30] me the person who I will touch is the
[1:19:32] person who I will
[1:19:36] marry flesh the body is the Temple of
[1:19:40] Tabernacle I cannot defile
[1:19:43] it and she lives her
[1:19:47] life but when she meets a
[1:19:51] company when she meets friends
[1:19:55] they would tell
[1:19:57] her a woman cannot be like
[1:20:00] this a woman cannot wait like this all
[1:20:03] the way till she will
[1:20:06] marry but she already had a
[1:20:10] decision to keep herself to protect
[1:20:14] herself and to be faithful for her
[1:20:18] husband but because of the
[1:20:21] group because of a friend or because of
[1:20:25] a
[1:20:27] friend someone deviates easily amen
[1:20:33] amen and they destroy the word of God
[1:20:38] amen
[1:20:41] amen you can see a man who's going to
[1:20:44] work because of friend or
[1:20:49] Soul he and then he comes home
[1:20:53] and change why because he was
[1:20:57] influenced by his work
[1:21:00] friends you can see children going to
[1:21:04] school you see the parent gave them a
[1:21:07] certain
[1:21:08] influence of the word of
[1:21:11] God and now they went to
[1:21:15] school and now by arriving at
[1:21:18] school they find
[1:21:21] friends that may influence them
[1:21:24] to do whatever
[1:21:27] whatsoever and then they defile their
[1:21:32] body we'll read something from the
[1:21:34] prophet trying to run
[1:21:37] with in um Hebrew chapter
[1:21:42] 7 second part Hebrew chapter 7 number
[1:21:46] two

[1:23:43] influence with the people and the and
[1:23:46] the things like that and you're guilty
[1:23:49] of it that's what Jesus said

[1:25:34] fruit of your lips giving praise to God
[1:25:39] [Music]
[1:25:56] [Music]
[1:26:12] [Music]
[1:26:21] in
[1:26:22] 1960 in the paragram
[1:26:24] Church age paragraph 7 79 see it is just
[1:26:30] see it just goes to show give the best
[1:26:32] that you have give your life give your
[1:26:35] time give everything to Christ and that
[1:26:39] same spirit that lived in Christ lives
[1:26:42] in you and your influence in your
[1:26:46] neighborhood and upon the people that
[1:26:48] you dwell with will be so much like
[1:26:52] Christ till it will work the same thing
[1:26:55] Christ
[1:26:57] [Music]
[1:26:59] did I read something in um The Book of
[1:27:02] Matthew
[1:27:05] chapter chapter
[1:27:17] 28 Jesus telling the discipl to do
[1:27:19] whatever
[1:27:39] Matthew chapter 28 verse 20 it says
[1:27:42] teaching them to observe all things
[1:27:45] whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I
[1:27:49] Am With You Always even onto the end of
[1:27:53] the world amen
[1:27:56] amen
[1:28:00] amen here Jesus is saying not that he
[1:28:03] will
[1:28:05] be not that he will be with you on
[1:28:09] Monday so that way you can fall
[1:28:17] on not that he will be with you this
[1:28:20] Wednesday and after tomorrow you go and
[1:28:22] then you commit
[1:28:24] said always every day he's always
[1:28:28] present amen
[1:28:31] amen now we
[1:28:34] seen there's a presence of
[1:28:36] God that doesn't have
[1:28:40] effect where you can find yourself in a
[1:28:42] trial you're praying you're
[1:28:45] fasting and there's
[1:28:48] nothing
[1:28:51] why why is that the case because there
[1:28:55] amen
[1:29:00] amen we read
[1:29:08] something of God can be
[1:29:12] active you have God and God
[1:29:15] is
[1:29:17] reacting when it's activated the Pres of
[1:29:20] God is activated God is reacting when
[1:29:23] it's passive
[1:29:24] God is not
[1:29:30] reacting the presence of God can be
[1:29:32] active or
[1:29:35] passive they're passive when God is
[1:29:39] there and he's not
[1:29:42] reacting we read Joshua chapter
[1:29:47] 7 Israel had the
[1:29:50] arc they had the presence of God
[1:29:54] [Music]
[1:29:55] but they were humbled
[1:29:58] before because of
[1:30:05] sin why Cas because there's elements
[1:30:08] that will deactivate the presence of God
[1:30:11] amen
[1:30:14] amen and the elements that will
[1:30:16] deactivate the presence of
[1:30:19] God it's
[1:30:21] sin amen amen
[1:30:25] God said in Isaiah
[1:30:29] 50
[1:30:31] 59 chapter chapter 59 verse 1 to
[1:30:39] 3 his arm are not short to
[1:30:42] deliver nor is his
[1:30:45] ear heavy to to listen but it's our
[1:30:50] sin sin that are putting a separation
[1:30:53] amen amen amen
[1:30:56] amen it's our sin that are putting that
[1:31:05] separation for your hands
[1:31:08] are are full of blood and
[1:31:14] crime sin is the element that deactivate
[1:31:16] the
[1:31:18] presence He Who Walks In The Life
[1:31:21] of even if he's going to church
[1:31:28] they're fasting and they're giving
[1:31:31] gift and while they're dwelling in sin
[1:31:35] even those gift they not work even if
[1:31:37] you're making a business or work it will
[1:31:39] not work amen
[1:31:43] amen will
[1:31:46] deactivate progress of that because
[1:31:48] their
[1:31:49] sin amen
[1:31:56] Cain had hatred towards Abel
[1:32:03] you because the element that deactivate
[1:32:05] the presence of
[1:32:08] God for example arrogance jeal
[1:32:13] jealousy
[1:32:15] hatred you hate your brother your
[1:32:17] brother you hate your sister you hate
[1:32:20] your spouse your husband you hate your
[1:32:23] wife you hate your parents you hate your
[1:32:26] pastor you hate your
[1:32:29] children those are elements that will
[1:32:32] deactivate the presence of
[1:32:37] God sin is a very dangerous
[1:32:40] element that deactivate the presence of
[1:32:45] God elements that activates the presence
[1:32:47] of
[1:32:50] God elements it's sanctification
[1:32:54] amen
[1:32:55] amen there's
[1:32:59] sanctification see in Matthew
[1:33:02] chapter
[1:33:07] six because the disciple ask Jesus how
[1:33:10] to pray and so
[1:33:14] forth Matthew 6 verse 9 amen
[1:33:27] Matthew 6
[1:33:29] ver9 listen to
[1:33:34] this after this manner therefore
[1:33:38] pray Our Father which are in
[1:33:43] heaven be thy
[1:33:47] name you see the word
[1:33:50] sanctification someone that's walking in
[1:33:53] a life of
[1:33:55] ification they can arrive
[1:33:58] somewhere he doesn't need to
[1:34:01] fast he doesn't need to make long
[1:34:04] prayers and the Lord will
[1:34:08] act why because he Walking with God amen
[1:34:12] amen amen
[1:34:15] amen sanctification activates the
[1:34:18] presence of God amen amen
[1:34:24] because a life that is Sanctified It's A
[1:34:26] Life That's P
[1:34:29] aside it's a person individual that's
[1:34:32] already placed
[1:34:34] aside a sanctification is a life that's
[1:34:36] put
[1:34:37] aside a life that does not
[1:34:40] have that doesn't have
[1:34:44] compromise with wrong things that people
[1:34:46] are
[1:34:48] practicing ification or holiness
[1:34:55] it starts or activates the presence of
[1:35:01] God the physical presence of
[1:35:04] God is the
[1:35:07] manifestation of the
[1:35:10] person of the Divine person of
[1:35:14] God
[1:35:17] God God is a spirit you cannot see him
[1:35:19] right
[1:35:20] here but his physical presence
[1:35:24] it's
[1:35:27] manifested when I can make pray or when
[1:35:30] I'm
[1:35:32] preaching feel his
[1:35:34] presence
[1:35:36] see feel his
[1:35:39] presence when you have a problem and
[1:35:42] when you're
[1:35:43] praying you you will sense God reacting
[1:35:47] amen
[1:35:49] amen sanctification brings that right
[1:35:53] amen
[1:35:57] amen for that I'm not saying you cannot
[1:36:02] fast because where you're when you're in
[1:36:04] the life of
[1:36:06] sanctification you also have a
[1:36:09] revelation that if I am
[1:36:11] sanctifying I also have to be like
[1:36:14] this and to be
[1:36:16] Sanctified you have to pray because the
[1:36:21] sanctification will bring you to prayer
[1:36:24] will bring you to
[1:36:28] sanctification when you're not
[1:36:30] praying how will you sanctify yourself
[1:36:33] when you're not coming to church when
[1:36:36] missing
[1:36:38] meetings you be
[1:36:41] Sanctified God does not
[1:36:46] dwell does not dwell in what man has
[1:36:51] built God dwells in what
[1:36:55] he what is God
[1:36:57] building his word that's coming out like
[1:37:00] this listening to this word this word is
[1:37:04] sanctifying
[1:37:06] you when you're applying this
[1:37:09] word it's removing Sin from
[1:37:12] you even if you committed whatever
[1:37:17] sin it's washing you it's cleansing you
[1:37:21] amen amen
[1:37:23] [Applause]
[1:37:29] we cannot refuse to pray and fast
[1:37:32] because Jesus he himself had
[1:37:35] prayed and he also said certain
[1:37:39] demons that they can only come out
[1:37:43] because of
[1:37:44] prayers by only prayers
[1:37:48] amen may God be praised
[1:37:50] [Music]
[1:37:53] the second
[1:37:58] elementat that activates the presence of
[1:38:02] God it's attach your attachment to God
[1:38:07] to the word of
[1:38:09] God it's a word that it's a relationship
[1:38:13] in relationship with God attachment to
[1:38:16] God is
[1:38:17] element that activates the presence of
[1:38:20] God in John chapter
[1:38:24] 15 verse 1 to
[1:38:28] 5 Jesus
[1:38:32] said I am
[1:38:36] Divine in other words he is the tree in
[1:38:39] another
[1:38:41] term and you if you're the branch you
[1:38:43] get away from the
[1:38:45] tree tell me how will you bear
[1:38:48] fruit because you're

[1:39:17] husband husband attach yourself to the
[1:39:20] wife and they will call you a couple
[1:39:24] it means two people that becomes
[1:39:27] one when you're attached to one
[1:39:31] another the enemy will not
[1:39:33] answer what is hard and difficult God
[1:39:37] will render it simple easy where there's
[1:39:41] no where there's no way God will create
[1:39:44] a
[1:39:45] way may God be praise
[1:39:53] attached to
[1:40:00] me my S my brother my
[1:40:04] sister stay attached to the
[1:40:07] Lord and you will bear many
[1:40:10] [Applause]
[1:40:12] fruits a lot of Christians are not
[1:40:14] bearing
[1:40:15] fruits why because they're not attached
[1:40:18] to the
[1:40:19] [Applause]
[1:40:20] lord they're attached to men and
[1:40:24] [Applause]
[1:40:26] congregation you have to be attached to
[1:40:28] the
[1:40:29] Lord you have to be attached to the word
[1:40:32] of
[1:40:33] God and the father
[1:40:37] will will allow you to so you can bear a
[1:40:40] lot of

[1:41:13] fruits the presence of God is
[1:41:16] what the presence of God the presence of
[1:41:19] God manif the manifestation the physical
[1:41:21] manifestation
[1:41:25] of the person of the Living
[1:41:29] God the one who is
[1:41:31] invisible in in the life of
[1:41:34] men we're seeing over here with the
[1:41:37] pastor God had
[1:41:39] said to make
[1:41:45] temples because he wanted to to man that
[1:41:48] he
[1:41:49] created and when he saw
[1:41:52] that it was not enough to dwell in the
[1:41:58] tentomon build for me a
[1:42:01] temple and in the temple he was
[1:42:04] there where people could come into the
[1:42:08] temple like you
[1:42:11] saw Solomon had
[1:42:15] prayed I have

[1:43:08] prayer and I have chosen this place to
[1:43:12] myself for a house of sacrifice right
[1:43:29] [Music]

[1:43:43] rain or if I command the Locust to
[1:43:47] Devour the land or if I send pestilence
[1:43:51] among my people if my people which are
[1:43:54] called by my name shall humble
[1:43:57] themselves and pray and seek my face and
[1:44:01] turn from their Wicked Ways then then
[1:44:05] will I hear from heaven and will forgive
[1:44:08] their sin and will heal their land
[1:44:22] [Music]

[1:44:34] Chronicle 7 verse1 now when Solomon had
[1:44:37] made an end of prayers of praying the
[1:44:41] the fire came down from heaven and
[1:44:43] consumed the burnt offering and the

[1:48:41] another I just can't stand it something
[1:48:45] in something just inside me burning
[1:48:53] um
[1:48:55] speaking paragraph 17 we know of the
[1:48:59] woman at the

[1:49:43] sisters he is still the high priest of
[1:49:46] our

[1:50:26] confession extremely he's greater than
[1:50:30] ever we must also be his
[1:50:33] servant he is the
[1:50:36] vine the source of
[1:50:38] life we are the
[1:50:41] branches that receives that
[1:50:47] life and the branches bear the
[1:50:50] fruits not the Vine
[1:50:55] and now Christ Works
[1:51:08] through and then if we can yield ourself
[1:51:13] in such a way that the Holy Spirit can
[1:51:16] take complete control of us in our faith
[1:51:19] in Christ he will do the same thing
[1:51:22] because it's
[1:51:24] [Music]
[1:51:25] [Applause]
[1:51:28] Christ another element that activates
[1:51:31] the presence of God it's
[1:51:34] humility when someone is
[1:51:38] humble the Bible say Jesus humbled
[1:51:41] himself all the way to The Obedience of
[1:51:44] death he who accepted
[1:51:49] they how how much more we can people
[1:51:53] spit on us how much more we do not even
[1:51:56] allow people to tell us the truth we
[1:51:58] always see we
[1:52:00] always but God had humbled
[1:52:09] himself has said in Proverbs
[1:52:13] 224 he said the fruits of
[1:52:18] humility of the fear of the
[1:52:21] Lord or Rich
[1:52:24] glory and life you
[1:52:30] [Music]
[1:52:32] see Christ is the vine of Christ is the
[1:52:37] Incarnation of uh
[1:52:42] humility and other elements that
[1:52:45] activates the presence of God we spoke
[1:52:46] of prayer how did Solomon pray and then
[1:52:50] the glory of God had came down amen
[1:52:53] amen the prayer is an element that
[1:52:56] activates the presence of
[1:53:00] God amen
[1:53:05] amen may God be
[1:53:13] praised may God be praised
[1:53:21] [Music]
[1:53:23] sin keeps us away from God takes us away
[1:53:26] from
[1:53:28] God but when we have a sanctification
[1:53:31] life of sanctification when we have
[1:53:37] humility that brings us closer to God
[1:53:40] amen
[1:53:41] amen that brings us closer to
[1:53:48] God the influence it's what
[1:53:53] the prophet preached
[1:53:56] about the influence influence is the
[1:53:59] capacity
[1:54:00] of of modifying a
[1:54:03] behavior or a
[1:54:06] way or a way of changing someone's
[1:54:10] thought you had a good
[1:54:13] behavior you had a good
[1:54:16] thought but when you meet an individual
[1:54:22] you change your
[1:54:24] life you start to
[1:54:26] fall you start to
[1:54:29] lie you start to
[1:54:31] steal you start to
[1:54:33] kill you start
[1:54:37] to gos said
[1:54:42] amen influence is a
[1:54:48] power it's having control over someone
[1:54:51] or something that's right am
[1:54:53] amen when someone is coming to you to
[1:54:57] influence you he has the power to
[1:54:59] control you so you can do what he says
[1:55:02] for you to
[1:55:03] do and then you'll start following him
[1:55:06] amen
[1:55:07] amen may God be
[1:55:13] praised I'm climbing down
