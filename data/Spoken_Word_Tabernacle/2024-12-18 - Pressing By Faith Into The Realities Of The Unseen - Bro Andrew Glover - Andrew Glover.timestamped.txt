[57:58] new year Lord may we take inventory oh
[58:01] God and Lord may we move forward
[58:03] underneath the banner of this word now
[58:06] father we commit this service tonight in
[58:08] thy precious name the name of the Lord
[58:10] Jesus Christ we pray and all the
[58:12] Believers says amen amen and amen God
[58:16] bless you tonight if you have your
[58:17] Bibles we want to go to the book of St
[58:19] Luke the 16th chapter the book of St
[58:22] Luke the 16th chapter and then also
[58:24] we're going to read in Philippians in 2
[58:27] Corinthians amen while you're turning
[58:28] there tonight we do want to bring in
[58:30] greetings from our pastor brother Matt
[58:31] Morris and the Saints there at home and
[58:34] Grace Tabernacle send their greetings to
[58:35] you tonight and we do appreciate having
[58:38] brother Thomas here with us again
[58:39] tonight appreciate him bringing us over
[58:41] and amen sure appreciate the Lord amen
[58:44] amen St Luke chapter
[58:46] 16 and verse number
[58:49] 16 the law and the prophets were until
[58:52] John and since that time the kingdom of
[58:55] God is preached and every man presseth
[58:59] that's right into it I want you to catch
[59:02] this the kingdom of God is preached yes
[59:04] sir or spoken or declared or published
[59:08] the kingdom of God is preached and every
[59:11] man presseth into it so there is a
[59:14] preaching of the Kingdom but then there
[59:17] is a pressing into the preaching of the
[59:20] kingdom of God now in Philippians
[59:22] chapter 3 Philippians chapter 3
[59:26] in verse number 13 another uh very
[59:29] familiar scripture to you now in the
[59:32] scriptures here tonight Philippians 3
[59:35] and verse 13 Paul here is using the word
[59:38] again of our Lord Jesus there in St Luke
[59:40] 16 and verse number 13 He says Brethren
[59:44] I count not myself to have apprehended
[59:46] right but this one thing I do forgetting
[59:50] those things which are behind that's
[59:53] right and reaching forth unto those
[59:55] things which are before notice not going
[59:59] back to what's behind us forgetting
[1:00:02] what's behind us and pressing forward
[1:00:06] toward the mark for the prize of the
[1:00:08] High Calling of God in Christ Jesus so
[1:00:12] whatever is behind us is not worth going
[1:00:15] back to it's worth
[1:00:18] forgetting but whatever is in front of
[1:00:20] us is worth pressing forward to in the
[1:00:24] book of 2 Corinthians chapter 4 2
[1:00:27] Corinthians chapter 4 there I believe
[1:00:29] we'll find the way that we press 2
[1:00:32] Corinthians chapter 4 and verse number
[1:00:36] 13 Paul again here writing he says now
[1:00:40] we having the same Spirit of Faith
[1:00:43] according as it is written I believed
[1:00:46] and therefore have I spoken that's right
[1:00:49] now we also believe and therefore speak
[1:00:53] so Paul is showing us the way we press
[1:00:56] is believing the things that have been
[1:00:58] spoken in the spirit of the same Faith
[1:01:01] they were spoken in so they're spoken by
[1:01:04] faith you believe them by faith and then
[1:01:07] you speak them by faith and as you speak
[1:01:10] them you press forward look at the 18th
[1:01:13] verse while we look not at the things
[1:01:16] which are seen But at the things which
[1:01:18] are not seen for the things which are
[1:01:21] seen are temporal that's right so
[1:01:24] they're just passing they're temporary
[1:01:26] that's but the things which are not seen
[1:01:29] are Eternal we ask Lord this evening to
[1:01:32] add the blessing to the reading of his
[1:01:33] word as you can have your seats here
[1:01:35] this afternoon I want to uh by the help
[1:01:38] of the Lord for just a few moments
[1:01:39] tonight if I would take a title I want
[1:01:41] to talk to you on this pressing by faith
[1:01:44] into the realities of the Unseen
[1:01:47] pressing by faith into the realities of
[1:01:50] the Unseen you know I believe tonight we
[1:01:52] can all agree that God is a reality
[1:01:56] Amen brother br will tell us that many
[1:01:58] times God is a reality now when you
[1:02:01] begin to speak of this word press that
[1:02:03] word press Webster defines it amen it
[1:02:06] means to move or to cause to move into a
[1:02:09] position of contact with someone or
[1:02:12] something by
[1:02:14] exerting a continuous physical Force so
[1:02:17] when you when you are pressing on
[1:02:19] something amen you are intending to move
[1:02:22] it by applying Force upon it when you
[1:02:25] look here it word reality uh Webster
[1:02:28] again says reality is a thing that
[1:02:31] exists in fact amen having previously
[1:02:34] only existed in one's mind so at one
[1:02:37] time what you see in reality was only
[1:02:41] existing in one's mind now amen how can
[1:02:43] I think of that and not be reminded of
[1:02:46] Michelangelo when he sculpted that great
[1:02:49] sculpture of Moses and the prophet of
[1:02:51] God said see the negative of the what
[1:02:54] was in his mind had become real it
[1:02:57] become positive therefore it sprung into
[1:03:00] him amen so before there was a reality
[1:03:04] of what was in his mind amen there was a
[1:03:07] thought there was a desire there was an
[1:03:09] idea amen but it had to be transferred
[1:03:12] amen into reality now you know tonight
[1:03:15] that the most powerful force on Earth
[1:03:18] amen is a believer in contact with his
[1:03:21] maker the prophet of God will say this
[1:03:23] there is no more powerful for worse than
[1:03:26] God Amen another place one of the
[1:03:28] doctors said well I tell you I find that
[1:03:31] the greatest power in the world Amen is
[1:03:33] not the atomic bomb amen but a believer
[1:03:37] in contact with his maker it changes the
[1:03:40] whole attitude it changes his mental it
[1:03:43] changes his habit it changes his body
[1:03:46] amen it changes his nature everything
[1:03:49] now at 1949 brother speaking I was not
[1:03:52] disobedient to the heavenly vision and
[1:03:55] it begins to to talk about the subject
[1:03:57] of Science and he said now just thinking
[1:03:59] of how that science how they are taking
[1:04:02] amen the natural man and how he's went
[1:04:04] into the research amen from the fall of
[1:04:06] the natural and what he has done but how
[1:04:09] little the spiritual man has progressed
[1:04:12] Amen in the kingdom of God so there is a
[1:04:14] natural man amen and there is a
[1:04:16] spiritual man he said I was thinking
[1:04:19] that the natural man went out amen at
[1:04:21] the Unseen of his eye and he pulled an
[1:04:24] adom down out of the sky and he split
[1:04:26] that Adam in two that destroys human
[1:04:30] life now if the natural man that knows
[1:04:33] nothing of God and cannot know nothing
[1:04:35] of God except he be converted then his
[1:04:38] soul becomes alive with the supernal if
[1:04:42] he could do that in the natural realm
[1:04:45] amen then what off a man of God to be
[1:04:47] doing my friends he said the church is
[1:04:50] so far behind amen but let's pray my
[1:04:53] that God Amen will move his church up
[1:04:57] the natural man with the natural
[1:04:59] resource is getting greater results amen
[1:05:02] than the people are that calls
[1:05:04] themselves Christians Listen he says
[1:05:06] let's press into the Unseen amen let's
[1:05:11] press into the Unseen the blessings are
[1:05:14] there amen they're yours and they are
[1:05:17] there for you listen it took a prophet
[1:05:20] to come among the church and to identify
[1:05:23] where the blessings amen of the church
[1:05:25] are the blessings are not in the natural
[1:05:28] amen they're not in the seene they're
[1:05:30] not in the visible amen but the
[1:05:32] blessings are in the Unseen that's why a
[1:05:35] Prophet come among the church and
[1:05:36] preaches about three times amen looking
[1:05:39] at the Unseen amen or looking to the
[1:05:42] Unseen 1950 he says looking the Unseen I
[1:05:46] want you to I want you to take this
[1:05:47] quote in your heart and I want you to
[1:05:49] take it as a foundation for this sermon
[1:05:52] he said now we look at the Unseen and
[1:05:56] believe those things that which are
[1:05:58] unseen amen but spoke of by God Amen
[1:06:02] they become
[1:06:04] Realties we look at the Unseen and
[1:06:08] believe that those things which are
[1:06:10] unseen amen but spoke of by God they
[1:06:14] become realities listen what it is it's
[1:06:18] the infallibility or the authority of
[1:06:21] God's spoken word he said if this
[1:06:24] audience tonight could only get settled
[1:06:26] in their mind of who said this and what
[1:06:29] this really is this spoken word we would
[1:06:32] not need a healing service we would not
[1:06:34] need any salvation altar call it would
[1:06:37] be finished if you realized amen what
[1:06:40] the word was amen now let's look at it
[1:06:43] amen before it could be a word
[1:06:46] spoken it has to be a thought because a
[1:06:50] word is a thought made manifest when God
[1:06:53] speaks amen so a word is a fault made
[1:06:57] manifest when God speaks now back in the
[1:07:00] beginning when God looked down to the
[1:07:02] corridors of heaven and saw all the
[1:07:05] things amen that were going to happen on
[1:07:08] the earth did you ever say it and just
[1:07:10] draw a picture out in your mind amen
[1:07:12] that's the way God did it amen perhaps
[1:07:15] in the beginning then it seemed good to
[1:07:17] him so he spoke it and as soon as it was
[1:07:21] spoken it became a word amen the thought
[1:07:25] was expressed in a word now listen once
[1:07:29] God expresses his thought and makes it a
[1:07:32] word he can never take it back oh Church
[1:07:36] of the Living God when God ever thinks
[1:07:39] something and then speaks what he is
[1:07:41] thinking it becomes a word or an
[1:07:45] expression of a fault and God can never
[1:07:48] take it back how perfect it was amen
[1:07:51] before the foundation of the world Amen
[1:07:54] Jesus was already slain the Bible said
[1:07:58] he was the lamb amen slain from the
[1:08:00] foundation of the world how was he slain
[1:08:04] amen the very minute God spoke the word
[1:08:07] it was settled forever the seed was
[1:08:10] planted and it had to come to pass
[1:08:13] because he cannot speak nothing but the
[1:08:16] unadulterated truth amen so Jesus was
[1:08:19] the Lamb of God Amen that would be slain
[1:08:22] listen it was 4,000 years amen from the
[1:08:26] time that was spoken until the time that
[1:08:28] it was fulfilled amen but listen it
[1:08:31] never failed and it became a reality
[1:08:34] what are you saying I'm saying church
[1:08:37] that we are a two-fold being amen we
[1:08:39] have an inward man and we have an
[1:08:41] outward man and the prophet of God said
[1:08:44] the outward man amen he looks by his
[1:08:47] eyes amen but the inward man walks by
[1:08:50] faith we have to be led by one of these
[1:08:52] two person the outward man is self amen
[1:08:56] but the inward man is God you see you do
[1:08:59] not see with our eyes though many times
[1:09:02] we thought we see with our eyes we only
[1:09:04] look with our eyes amen but we see with
[1:09:07] our heart we look with our eyes but we
[1:09:11] see with our heart listen Malachi 4 said
[1:09:15] that he would turn our hearts amen back
[1:09:18] to the faith of the Pentecostal father
[1:09:20] listen God done that in order for the
[1:09:23] church amen to see more than the
[1:09:25] problems to see more than the situations
[1:09:28] to see more than the doctor's report to
[1:09:31] see more than your past to see more than
[1:09:33] the oh God to see more than everything
[1:09:36] that's going on around you but God sent
[1:09:39] a message in this generation Amen to
[1:09:42] turn our hearts amen back to the faith
[1:09:45] so we could see things the way God sees
[1:09:48] things we can believe things the way God
[1:09:51] believes things and when you begin to
[1:09:54] believe the way God believes it will be
[1:09:57] more than just a good service it will be
[1:09:59] more than just a gathering but what
[1:10:01] you're believing will become a reality
[1:10:05] in the Church of the Living
[1:10:08] God hallelujah amen we're not serving a
[1:10:11] god of our
[1:10:13] imagination we're not serving a god of
[1:10:15] wood or stone or some Idol amen but we
[1:10:18] are serving a living God therefore I
[1:10:21] believe if we are believers it is time
[1:10:24] Amen to press forward amen can I say
[1:10:27] this to you it's not time to lay down
[1:10:30] it's not time to let the outward man
[1:10:32] amen Rob the inward man it's time to do
[1:10:35] what a prophet said he said come
[1:10:38] together as one unit get away from our
[1:10:41] differences lay aside our doctrines and
[1:10:44] put our arms together and press forward
[1:10:48] and take the promise that God Almighty
[1:10:51] has given us well I don't know about you
[1:10:54] amen but this message has done more amen
[1:10:57] than just stimulate my intellect it has
[1:10:59] done more than just make me feel a
[1:11:01] little bit better than somebody else it
[1:11:04] has revealed to me that there is a Bible
[1:11:07] and it is a prophetic book and it is
[1:11:09] full of prophetic promises listen we
[1:11:12] have been called under a Divine
[1:11:15] commission to possess Divine
[1:11:20] promises there is a promise of healing
[1:11:22] in this book and somebody's going to it
[1:11:26] there is a promise of Deliverance and
[1:11:28] somebody is going to possess it there is
[1:11:30] a promise of a breakthrough and somebody
[1:11:34] is going to possess it there is a
[1:11:36] promise amen that a man can live so
[1:11:39] close to God until the devil don't know
[1:11:41] what to do with him and somebody is
[1:11:44] going to do more than read it they're
[1:11:46] going to do more than memorize it
[1:11:48] they're going to possess it because
[1:11:50] they're here commissioned of God they're
[1:11:53] not looking to the left they're not
[1:11:55] looking to the right said a man that is
[1:11:58] commissioned of God he looks
[1:12:01] upward a man that's under a commission
[1:12:04] of God he does not look to the right he
[1:12:07] does not look to the left he does not
[1:12:09] look behind him he does not look below
[1:12:12] him he looks upward and onward he is not
[1:12:17] listening to the world he's got a Divine
[1:12:20] commission from
[1:12:22] God well somebody shout we're going
[1:12:26] forward we're not going backwards we're
[1:12:29] going forward we're not going back to

[1:12:36] shuck we're going forward listen the
[1:12:39] Holy Ghost is among the church and when
[1:12:42] the Holy Ghost comes among the church he
[1:12:44] is doing more than just making us shout
[1:12:47] he's doing more than just making us
[1:12:49] dance but he's making us
[1:12:51] perseverance come on church if you're

[1:13:08] strength of the general of the host of

[1:14:09] towards the mark of the High Calling

[1:14:22] claim on God Amen that ain't the time to
[1:14:24] rely
[1:14:25] and fold your arms and say well I made a
[1:14:28] claim that's the time to draw your sword

[1:15:25] pressing to a better atmosphere or
[1:15:27] pressing to a raise on our job we are
[1:15:31] pressing to the complete
[1:15:34] identification when all time will fade
[1:15:37] out into eternity when Jesus comes so
[1:15:41] there is a connection between the
[1:15:43] complete identification of the church
[1:15:46] and the coming of the Lord listen we're
[1:15:49] not going to have a rearview mirror
[1:15:51] Affair a rear viw mirrror only looks
[1:15:55] back to see where you've been but we're
[1:15:57] looking forward to see where we're going

[1:16:14] you I am not looking in the rearview
[1:16:16] mirror and saying God was moving in

[1:16:21] day and God was moving in Luther's day

[1:16:44] promised things today we're going
[1:16:47] on we're going on what are we doing we
[1:16:51] are pressing into the Fulfillment of
[1:16:54] scripture promises brother said like
[1:16:57] this break out of this Hollywood you got
[1:16:59] too much fashion to the world you got
[1:17:01] too much care amen break out of that he
[1:17:04] says we need a Revival now brother makes
[1:17:09] it very plain he said he said now look
[1:17:11] at Luke 16:16 the law and the prophets
[1:17:15] amen were un John amen but since that
[1:17:18] time amen the kingdom of God is preached
[1:17:22] and every man amen pray
[1:17:25] into it do you know the only way to
[1:17:28] advance Amen in this hour is to
[1:17:32] press there is a real devil and he's
[1:17:35] standing in front of you and he's
[1:17:37] telling you you've gone as far as you
[1:17:39] can go you've come as far as you can
[1:17:42] come you know what he's telling you he's
[1:17:44] telling you there's nothing else for you
[1:17:46] and you've got all that you can get but
[1:17:48] you know what I tell him I tell him he's
[1:17:50] a
[1:17:51] liar I tell him he's the father of all
[1:17:54] lies I tell him as long as I'm here and
[1:17:57] there's a desire in my heart for more of
[1:18:00] God there's more of God somewhere for me
[1:18:02] to
[1:18:04] have somewhere or another you got to get
[1:18:07] tired of letting that devil put
[1:18:09] spiritual limitations on your progress
[1:18:12] in the kingdom of God if the natural man
[1:18:15] has come all the way to artificial
[1:18:17] intelligence amen then what about the
[1:18:19] spiritual man I say we've gone beyond
[1:18:23] artificial intelligence we have stepped
[1:18:25] into the Supreme intelligence of Jesus
[1:18:28] Christ where there is a promise of a
[1:18:31] body change there is a promise of a
[1:18:33] future home there is a promise of a
[1:18:37] theophany come on if we're going to
[1:18:39] press we got to preach something worth
[1:18:42] pressing
[1:18:44] into now when you look here at this word
[1:18:47] prth the word preci means to use and to
[1:18:50] apply force in 1 Corinthians 9:26 you
[1:18:54] know what Paul says he said I therefore
[1:18:57] so run amen not as
[1:19:02] uncertainly so fight I not as one that
[1:19:05] beateth the
[1:19:07] air now let me say this we're not
[1:19:10] fighting Flesh and Blood we are fighting
[1:19:13] Spirits we are fighting Powers we are
[1:19:17] fighting wickedness we are fighting the
[1:19:19] slate and cunning craftiness of men
[1:19:22] whereby they lie and wait to deceive we
[1:19:25] are fighting a spiritual battle but the
[1:19:27] prophet of God comes along in
[1:19:29] 1963 and preaches the message
[1:19:32] desperations and he says every man amen
[1:19:35] presses into it amen not just simply
[1:19:39] walks in it amen but it's got to be
[1:19:41] pressed into so you're not going to
[1:19:44] Simply relax and take a stroll and just
[1:19:48] walk into these promises but you're
[1:19:50] going to have to press you're going to
[1:19:52] have to apply some Force you're going to
[1:19:54] have to use some violence against the
[1:19:55] devil and say devil I know you don't
[1:19:57] want me there but I want to tell you
[1:20:00] something you don't have enough to stop
[1:20:01] me because I know who I am I know who I
[1:20:05] am believing I know who I'm following I
[1:20:08] am following the Vindicated spoken
[1:20:12] word when brother R preaches that
[1:20:14] message desperation you'll find that
[1:20:16] desperation amen will cause you to press
[1:20:19] now let me say this the desperation that
[1:20:22] he was speaking of it was not a fear f
[1:20:25] it was not a begging desperation it was
[1:20:28] a desperation with a sense of urgency
[1:20:31] that there's something worth moving into
[1:20:34] he said the law and the prophets were
[1:20:36] until John but since then the Kingdom of
[1:20:39] Heaven has been preached and Men press
[1:20:43] into it you don't just stand around and
[1:20:45] say pick me up by the collar Lord and
[1:20:48] push me on in no you press into it you
[1:20:52] get desperate it's between life and
[1:20:55] death now let me say this I love what
[1:20:58] the pro of God does in 1963 when he
[1:21:00] preaches I'm just laying the foundation
[1:21:02] when he preaches desperation he said I
[1:21:04] want to speak tonight on giving them
[1:21:07] courage listen to is open and prayer I
[1:21:10] want to encourage them to take that
[1:21:12] god-given right they have a right to
[1:21:16] defeat that
[1:21:18] devil he is
[1:21:20] already
[1:21:21] defeated and he is just BL in them but
[1:21:26] I'm claiming them Father now help me to
[1:21:28] speak the word you speak through me Lord
[1:21:31] with this few notes I got wrote down
[1:21:33] here and little scriptures wrote out I
[1:21:36] pray that you'll help me Lord listen and
[1:21:38] get in the word so he's inviting the
[1:21:42] author of the word to come into the
[1:21:44] meeting and to get in the word and to
[1:21:48] give them faith for the glory of the
[1:21:50] Lord let me say this the faith that we
[1:21:53] need am and it Cometh From the word in
[1:21:56] Hebrews 11:1 Paul said faith is the
[1:22:00] substance of things hoped for it's the
[1:22:03] evidence of Things Not Seen for by it
[1:22:06] the elders obtained a good report listen
[1:22:09] and through
[1:22:11] faith and through faith we understand
[1:22:15] that the worlds were framed by the word
[1:22:18] of God so that the things which are seen
[1:22:21] were not made of things which do appear
[1:22:25] said like this he said now what you do
[1:22:28] is you testify of the things you do not
[1:22:34] see you testify of the things you do not
[1:22:38] see in other words you don't testify of
[1:22:42] what you
[1:22:43] see you testify of what you don't
[1:22:48] see come on now if you go to the doctor
[1:22:53] and the doctor runs a St in and he comes
[1:22:55] back and he said this is wrong and this
[1:22:57] is wrong and that's wrong we can see
[1:23:00] that but we don't testify that because
[1:23:04] what we see is only temporary but what
[1:23:08] we don't see is
[1:23:09] eternal so we begin to talk about the
[1:23:13] things we don't see we begin to talk
[1:23:16] come on church we don't testify of the
[1:23:19] CAT scan we don't testify of the blood
[1:23:22] report we don't testify of the MRI we
[1:23:25] testify of Isaiah 53 because Isaiah 53
[1:23:30] is more real than any report it's more
[1:23:33] real than any
[1:23:36] situation I don't care what you see I'm
[1:23:39] going to talk about what I don't
[1:23:43] see you testify of the things you do not
[1:23:49] [Applause]

[1:23:56] drugs you see the alcohol you see the
[1:24:00] filth you see the sin you see all that

[1:24:05] [Applause]
[1:24:06] that why are you talking about that that

[1:31:52] to get my eye so tuned down on the
[1:31:55] detailss that I can miss the prophecy I
[1:31:58] believe the

[1:32:05] said the Bible said Noah waited and
[1:32:07] believed and mo with fear and he built
[1:32:09] an ark he said don't criticize while the
[1:32:11] old fellow must have been crazy he said
[1:32:13] there had no clouds ever come but there
[1:32:16] was a cloud before there was a drop of
[1:32:18] water in the Skies Noah with the Unseen
[1:32:22] of the natural ey but with his spiritual
[1:32:25] eye tuned to the word of God he's seen
[1:32:29] the rain
[1:32:31] falling oh if we tonight could so tune
[1:32:34] our hearts amen not our literal mind Let
[1:32:37] It Go but cast down reasonings but with
[1:32:40] our hearts could tune it to the word of
[1:32:43] God to see a Revival Break Forth to see
[1:32:46] the altars full to see the church pack
[1:32:48] to see the Revival spreading through Los
[1:32:50] Angeles a fire that cannot be put out
[1:32:53] our Hearts would begin to pulsate under
[1:32:56] the power of the Holy Ghost there would
[1:32:59] be such a prayer meeting over Los
[1:33:00] Angeles tonight it would have to happen
[1:33:03] he said when the church is in tune what
[1:33:05] if people here tonight that's sick would
[1:33:08] begin to think God is
[1:33:10] God and if he isn't then why serve him
[1:33:14] listen if he's still God he's still a
[1:33:16] Healer if he's allmighty God he can do
[1:33:19] all things and if he made a promise he
[1:33:22] cannot break it he has to keep
[1:33:23] [Music]

[1:33:29] your heart something is going to take
[1:33:33] place there could be nothing stop it

[1:34:11] the unbelief and there is a reality
[1:34:13] burst in that Soul oh he said see he in
[1:34:17] the body it doesn't become a fiction it
[1:34:19] becomes a reality amen the baptism of
[1:34:22] the Holy Spirit it doesn't become an
[1:34:24] emotional worked up substance it becomes
[1:34:26] a reality of the indwelling presence of
[1:34:30] the Lord Jesus Christ to change the life
[1:34:34] see friends it's not by our feelings
[1:34:36] that we press it's not by our emotions
[1:34:39] that we press it's by the spoken word of
[1:34:42] God it's by the word of faith that we
[1:34:46] press the Bible said the word of faith
[1:34:49] which we preach you know what a prophet
[1:34:51] of God said he said the preaching of the
[1:34:54] gospel is a million miles Beyond just
[1:34:58] Visions he said it's a million miles
[1:35:01] Beyond just the Supernatural part he
[1:35:03] said see the success of the church amen
[1:35:06] it lies within the preaching of the
[1:35:09] Gospel of the power of God and the
[1:35:12] demonstration of the spirit so what does
[1:35:15] God do God sends his word by anointed
[1:35:19] preachers who will preach to you the
[1:35:22] spoken word and they will speak it in
[1:35:25] the same Spirit of
[1:35:29] faith that it was spoken this what a
[1:35:32] prophet said he said you can only serve
[1:35:34] God on the earth as God's servants that
[1:35:37] sent on Earth by divine inspiration
[1:35:41] interprets the word to
[1:35:43] you who Mercy therefore he sent anointed
[1:35:49] preachers to preach the word and you
[1:35:52] received it listen he sent anointed
[1:35:56] preachers to preach the word and you
[1:35:59] received it he said Christ does not
[1:36:02] anoint ministers to preach the gospel
[1:36:05] just have it returned back to him void
[1:36:07] but he expects you to receive the word
[1:36:11] and in receiving the word be
[1:36:14] ready come on Church in receiving the
[1:36:17] word be ready listen we have been taught
[1:36:21] that we get what we expect if you expect
[1:36:24] bad you're going to get bad if you
[1:36:27] expect good you're going to get good
[1:36:29] listen if a human has the ability to
[1:36:32] bring to pass things by the Simplicity
[1:36:35] of expectation then what about the
[1:36:38] infinite
[1:36:40] God he expects us to receive his word
[1:36:45] what are you saying as you receive the
[1:36:48] word as you receive the word you become
[1:36:52] the word
[1:36:54] come on church as you hear the word as
[1:36:57] you receive the word as you believe the
[1:37:00] word you become the
[1:37:03] word listen this is the season of
[1:37:07] manifestation this is the season of
[1:37:09] Miracles it's the season when the spoken
[1:37:13] word is becoming a reality but not in
[1:37:16] Bible days not 50 years ago not 20 years
[1:37:20] ago but right here tonight
[1:37:24] right here tonight in the house of God
[1:37:27] the word of God is becoming a
[1:37:31] reality now what are you saying I'm
[1:37:35] saying the word of God is becoming a
[1:37:39] [Applause]
[1:37:41] reality can I say it like this in the
[1:37:44] same service yes prayer request are
[1:37:48] becoming testimonies
[1:37:55] in the same
[1:37:57] service not two weeks later not 3 weeks
[1:38:01] later but in the same service a prayer
[1:38:05] request is becoming a
[1:38:08] testimony Hallelujah because it's more
[1:38:11] than the ideas of a man it's the
[1:38:13] unadulterated truth of the spoken
[1:38:16] word what he saying Amen brother Zach
[1:38:19] you probably remember this amen a few
[1:38:21] years ago preaching down at brother
[1:38:22] Dale's on that Sunday night amen I was
[1:38:25] preaching there and it was back during
[1:38:27] coed and they brought a pray request up
[1:38:29] and it was actually 2020 I think amen
[1:38:31] right there they brought a prayer
[1:38:33] request up amen and they read this
[1:38:35] prayer request there was a baby stricken
[1:38:37] with a fever they were taking to the
[1:38:38] hospital the fever wouldn't break it was
[1:38:40] a high fever I never forget as long as I
[1:38:43] live and we prayed over that prayer
[1:38:45] request and I got up there and got to
[1:38:47] preaching on the household of faith and
[1:38:49] how we are not a part of the household
[1:38:51] of fear though it was a day of fear an
[1:38:53] hour of fear but we are a part of the
[1:38:56] household of faith and about halfway
[1:38:58] through that sermon they walked up the
[1:39:00] all up the A and they laid a testimony
[1:39:03] on the or a piece of paper and it said
[1:39:05] read it and I turned it over and I read
[1:39:07] it you know what it said it said the
[1:39:09] fever is
[1:39:12] broke the fever is broke and the baby's
[1:39:16] okay I think it was you amen that the
[1:39:18] Holy Ghost h on the front was that you
[1:39:20] Holy Ghost did amen I read that
[1:39:22] testimony brother Zach jumped up on the
[1:39:24] front row and took off front and down
[1:39:26] the aisle back and forth praising God
[1:39:29] you say that's an emotional worked up
[1:39:31] substance no it's not it's the reality
[1:39:35] of a Believer who is in contact with his
[1:39:38] maker it's the reality that if there is
[1:39:40] a devil there is a God and he's big
[1:39:44] enough and he's strong enough and he's
[1:39:46] Mighty enough to change the
[1:39:50] situation I refuse to lay down and let
[1:39:53] the devil take our
[1:39:57] services I tell you what it's time to do
[1:39:59] it's time to preach the word and go
[1:40:01] forward it's time to break the spirit
[1:40:05] the preaching of the
[1:40:07] Gospel the preaching of the
[1:40:10] Gospel is the casting
[1:40:14] out of the
[1:40:16] devil said what is
[1:40:19] it he said see the devil broke away from
[1:40:22] you he has too can I just say this right

[2:06:13] finish this and then brother Lunsford
[2:06:14] stands there and tells me brother Harvey
[2:06:16] Lunsford stands there and tells me that
[2:06:17] one day and I went back home and I sit
[2:06:19] down brother Steven and I started
[2:06:21] through the Rapture tape again and I
[2:06:23] said there's got to be a
[2:06:25] connection I said there's got to be a
[2:06:27] connection here and I got to reading it
[2:06:29] one day and all of a sudden he comes
[2:06:31] down there the end and he says this and
[2:06:34] now it has been
[2:06:38] spoken testing 1 two
[2:06:40] 3 and now it has been spoken and so
[2:06:45] shall it
[2:06:46] [Music]
[2:06:47] be I said oh my goodness it is the devil
[2:06:53] didn't want this spoken because he knows
[2:06:56] that in the early years of the ministry
[2:06:58] the prophet of God said things that are
[2:07:01] spoken of by God becomes
[2:07:05] realities and the devil knew if he could
[2:07:08] stop the speaking of the word that would
[2:07:11] produce the Rapture he could stop it
[2:07:14] from becoming a reality but a cigarette
[2:07:17] smoking backslid woman could not stop
[2:07:20] the prophet from speaking the word of
[2:07:23] rapture but I want to tell Leia tonight
[2:07:26] you cannot stop me from becoming the
[2:07:29] reality of the spoken
[2:07:32] word stand on your feet and give God
[2:07:37] praise it has been
[2:07:39] spoken it has been spoken and so shall
[2:07:45] it
[2:07:47] be come on musicians there's going to be
[2:07:50] a rapture
[2:07:52] [Applause]
[2:07:54] [Music]
[2:07:55] there's going to be a
[2:07:57] resurrection there's going to be a body
[2:08:01] change there's going to be a married
[2:08:04] supper of the
[2:08:05] [Music]
[2:08:12] Lamb the word of
[2:08:15] rapture has been
[2:08:17] spoken proen his word 64 and she will
[2:08:21] take the Rapture by the
[2:08:25] word says this in the Rapture see it's
[2:08:28] been spoken so shall it be heavens and
[2:08:32] earth will pass
[2:08:35] away but my words will never
[2:08:39] fail watch a prophet when he turns that
[2:08:42] in the end go listen to that Rapture
[2:08:43] tape when he turns in the end and he
[2:08:45] says these words he says now let there
[2:08:47] be light and let there be this he said
[2:08:49] see and as long as it went out of his
[2:08:52] mouth in a
[2:08:54] word as long as it went out of God's
[2:08:57] mouth in a word it has to be
[2:09:03] manifested it has to be devil it's too
[2:09:09] late it's already been
[2:09:15] spoken and there is a bride on the earth
[2:09:18] yes sir who is preaching what a prophet
[2:09:20] taught about the rapture
[2:09:23] and she's tuning her natural eye out of
[2:09:25] the picture and she's tuning her
[2:09:28] spiritual eye to God's
[2:09:29] word and she's believing
[2:09:32] things that are hard to
[2:09:35] believe but that's becoming literally
[2:09:38] fulfilled before her what are you saying
[2:09:41] brother Andrew the Propet of God said
[2:09:43] this he said the super sense is the holy
[2:09:45] spirit amen it's the faith of God that
[2:09:47] dwells in you and if you'll let the five
[2:09:50] senses be to the six sense it'll guide
[2:09:52] you and bring all the other five senses
[2:09:55] under the control of that super sense
[2:09:59] listen it makes you act where you do not
[2:10:03] think the five senses would ever think
[2:10:06] about can I can I dedicate this to the
[2:10:09] devil the devil can get into these five
[2:10:12] senses and lie to
[2:10:14] you but he cannot touch that super
[2:10:20] sense that's far beyond his reach that
