[7:05] Let's go to him this morning. Lord
[7:08] Jesus, we thank you for that blood this
[7:10] morning. Lord God, we thank you, Father,
[7:13] for this day, Lord. For we know, Lord,
[7:15] if we ask that you'll give us our daily

[7:22] of God, Lord, the bread. We thank you,
[7:25] Lord, for just everybody getting here
[7:27] safely, Lord. Watch over those that are
[7:29] still on the road, Lord God. Bless our
[7:33] invisible audience as well as this
[7:35] morning, Lord Jesus.
[7:37] We thank you, Father. We want to just
[7:39] lift your name and sing a few songs to
[7:41] you this morning, Lord God, and just
[7:43] exalt your name, Lord. And then we want
[7:45] to hear that word, Lord, that you've
[7:47] prepared for us, Lord. How good it is,
[7:50] Lord, to hear that word. We thank you,
[7:53] Father, for the fellowship that we had
[7:55] yesterday, Lord God, and the the word
[7:57] that came forth there yesterday, Lord.
[7:59] And we just want to just continue, Lord.
[8:03] We don't want to ever stop hearing this,
[8:05] Lord. We thank you, Lord. Bless each one
[8:08] that's sitting here this morning, Lord
[8:10] God. Just give them whatever they may
[8:12] need, Lord God, and just touch them,
[8:14] Lord, whether whatever it is, Lord.
[8:17] Bless our musicians this morning, Lord
[8:19] God, and our singers. Bless our
[8:21] technicians, Lord.
[8:23] We're not going to satisfied,
[8:26] Lord, what the devil's trying to do for
[8:28] us this morning, Lord God. He thought he
[8:30] had us, but we we're going to just
[8:32] continue, Lord. We're going to worship
[8:34] you, Lord. We got our sound and our
[8:36] instruments, Lord. So, we're going to
[8:37] lift you up with that as well. We thank
[8:40] you, Father. Have your perfect will this
[8:42] morning, Lord. We give everything to you
[8:44] in the precious name of Jesus Christ.
[8:47] Amen. And amen. Let's give him a big
[8:49] clap offering this morning. Hallelujah.

[9:27] Yes, I have found a friend in Jesus.
[9:31] He's everything to me. He's the fairest
[9:34] of 10,000 to my soul.
[9:38] The lily of the valley. In him alone I
[9:43] see. All I need to cleanse and make me
[9:46] fully whole.
[9:49] In sorrow he's my comfort. In trouble
[9:52] he's my stay. He tells me every care on
[9:56] him to roll. Hallelujah. He's the lily
[10:00] of the valley. A bright and morning
[10:04] star.

[10:14] sorrow for in temptation he's my strong
[10:17] and mighty town.
[10:20] I have all for him forsaken and all my
[10:24] idols torn from my heart. And now he
[10:28] keeps me by his power.
[10:31] Though all the world forsake me and
[10:34] Senore,
[10:36] through Jesus I shall safely reach that
[10:39] goal. Hallelujah. He's the lily of the
[10:43] valley, the bright and morning star.
[10:47] He's the fairest of 10,000 to my soul.
[10:52] He will never never leave me nor yet
[10:56] forsake me here. While I live by faith
[11:00] and do his blessed will.
[11:03] Oh fire about me. I've nothing now to
[11:08] fear from him.
[11:11] Some free soul shall fail
[11:14] and sweeping up to glory to see his
[11:18] blessed face where rivers of delight
[11:22] shall ever flow. Hallelujah.
[11:26] [Music]
[11:28] the brightest morning star. He's the
[11:31] fairest of 10,000 to my soul.

[11:40] power? Are you washed in the blood of
[11:44] the lamb?

[23:12] Amen.
[23:37] Good uh good morning everybody. Um God
[23:41] bless you. Sorry I am a little nervous.
[23:43] I was planning a different song. Um and
[23:46] uh the Lord had dropped this on my heart
[23:47] two weeks ago and funny enough for this
[23:50] even talked about overthinking yesterday
[23:52] and that is he pretty much described me.
[23:55] Um This morning I woke up and just
[23:58] pressed in my heart that this was a
[23:59] song. It's called Bloodline. If you know
[24:01] it, please go ahead and join me.
[24:05] Funny enough, the theme was about the
[24:07] blood this morning, too. So, it worked
[24:08] out perfectly.
[24:32] Even though my spirit
[24:36] and it seems I can't go but still
[24:42] I see victory.
[24:48] Many times I'm walking by faith and
[24:53] can't see what lies before me. But still
[24:59] I see victory.
[25:04] And I just got to tell you, Satan,
[25:09] you can't cross the bloodline
[25:13] because I'm covered by his blood.
[25:20] And you may stare and you may fight, but
[25:24] you're going to lose this battle
[25:27] tonight. Cuz remember,
[25:30] you can't cross the bloodline.
[25:37] [Music]
[25:40] And it seems we're fighting a lot. Oh,
[25:44] but remember
[25:46] we're standing on that rock.
[25:51] So, Satan,
[25:53] if I were you,
[25:56] I'd turn around and I'd give up, too. I
[26:00] do believe you're going
[26:04] to lose.
[26:07] And I just got to tell you, Satan,
[26:11] you can't cross the bloodline
[26:16] because I'm covered by his blood.
[26:22] And you may stare and you may fight, but
[26:26] you're going to lose this battle
[26:29] tonight. Cuz remember,
[26:33] you can't cross the blood line.
[26:36] Oh,
[26:38] I just got to tell you, Satan said you
[26:43] can't cross the bloodline
[26:47] because I'm covered by his love.
[26:53] And you may stay and you may fight, but
[26:57] you're going to lose this battle
[27:00] tonight. Just remember,
[27:04] you can't cross the bloodline.
[27:06] Sing it one more time.
[27:09] I just got to tell you, Satan, you can't
[27:14] cross the bloodline. No, cuz I'm covered
[27:20] by his blood.
[27:24] And you may stare and you may fight, but
[27:28] you're going to lose this battle
[27:31] tonight. Cuz remember,
[27:34] you can't cross the bloodline.
[27:40] And you may stare and you may fight, but
[27:44] you have lost this battle tonight. Guys,
[27:49] remember
[27:51] you can't cross the blood alive.
[28:01] Hallelujah.
[28:08] Wow.
[28:10] Amen.
[28:12] Praise God.
[28:26] [Music]
[28:30] Outers
[28:34] the storms raging highers
[28:39] around them they were trled that night.
[28:46] Fear filled their hearts and they
[28:49] thought they would die. They failed to
[28:53] remember
[28:55] that the master was nigh.
[29:00] He spoke the word and the winds all
[29:05] stood still.
[29:07] Even the waters
[29:11] they oyed his will
[29:15] and he calm their storms
[29:18] just like he will mine
[29:22] if I'll just remember
[29:26] that he lives deep inside.
[29:30] So why should I worry?
[29:34] And why should I fear
[29:37] when the very same Jesus,
[29:41] he stays always near. He lives in my
[29:47] heart
[29:49] and he hears when I cry.
[29:53] I'll call on his name
[29:56] till the storm passes by.
[30:02] [Music]
[30:04] We read in the Bible
[30:08] how he walked with them.
[30:12] Brought light to the darkness
[30:15] when the way grew so dim. How great it
[30:21] would be
[30:23] to have a steps leading mine
[30:27] to walk with the master
[30:31] all of the time. So when trials come
[30:39] and death is so nice,
[30:42] I'll just search for the master.
[30:46] I know he'll be there right on time. So
[30:50] when I'm in trouble
[30:54] and my body's in pain,
[30:58] all I have to do is just call on his
[31:04] name.
[31:05] So why should I worry?
[31:09] And why should I fear
[31:13] when the very same Jesus
[31:17] stays always near?
[31:20] He lives in my heart
[31:24] and he hears me when I cry and I'll call
[31:29] on his name
[31:31] till the storm passes by. Oh, why should
[31:37] I worry?
[31:39] And why should I fear
[31:43] when the very same Jesus,
[31:47] he stays always
[31:49] near. He lives in my heart
[31:54] and he hears me when I cry. And I'll
[31:58] call on his name
[32:01] till the storm passes by.
[32:05] And I'll call on his name
[32:09] till the storm passes by.
[32:13] [Music]
[32:18] [Applause]

[36:11] precious name of our Lord and Savior
[36:14] Jesus Christ, both visible and invisible
[36:18] audience. You might be seated. Let me
[36:20] just go straight through. Uh I have to
[36:23] get used to this board standing like
[36:25] this. Amen. Uh I believe uh all the
[36:31] family members here, welcome to Spoken
[36:33] Word Tabernacle. We don't have visitors.
[36:35] If it's your first time here, even your
[36:38] first time online, we welcome you in
[36:41] spoken word tabernacle. Amen.
[36:44] Um, don't know if everyone is here.
[36:47] Well, we can skip that one out. But I
[36:49] believe each one of us, we up to date
[36:51] with the sermon. We're reading our Bible
[36:54] twice a day. Our cood church ages, 70
[36:57] weeks of Daniel adoption seals or
[37:00] somebody's listening to the message of
[37:03] the hour. Amen. Remember, you're going
[37:06] to hear my voice in heaven.
[37:10] Don't worry, I have a quote.
[37:12] [Laughter]
[37:15] They will play that over again. Brother
[37:17] Brandham say, "Everything we do here
[37:19] will be recorded."
[37:22] And the only thing that can clean it up
[37:24] is the blood.
[37:27] That's right.
[37:27] Amen.
[37:28] So, you're going to hear me, you say, "I
[37:30] didn't have a chance." You're going to
[37:31] hear God say, "Let's play the tape over
[37:34] again." You're going to hear Brother
[37:35] Steven reminding you that you need to
[37:38] listen to the message. Amen.
[37:40] Yesterday, we had a wonderful question
[37:42] and answer by God's grace. Oh my.
[37:46] I even preached the seven seals in a way
[37:48] that I never thought
[37:51] and the thunders. Amen.
[37:54] Oh, glory to God. Maybe one day we will
[37:56] get into that in more detail. But that
[37:58] was the spirit of the Lord. I sent you a
[38:01] quote this morning. I believe everybody,
[38:04] unless your number is not in church
[38:07] group chat, but you received the quote
[38:09] this morning.
[38:10] It's a lengthy quote. I didn't want to
[38:12] put it on the board because I told you
[38:14] last time that brother Brandham say it
[38:16] was true. So, I put it in so we clear
[38:19] that up. So, if you didn't see it, not
[38:22] now. Now, you're going to see it after
[38:23] church. So, don't look at your phone
[38:25] right now. I already send it. It's
[38:27] there. If you didn't have a chance, it's
[38:29] there. You can verify what brother have
[38:32] said. I already send it. The whole
[38:34] church, if your number is there, you
[38:36] will see it after church. Amen. So,
[38:39] Lord's willing, on September the 28th,
[38:42] that's going to be our next question and
[38:45] answer. How many heard me? September
[38:48] 28th, our next question and answer. And
[38:50] what is coming up is on September 7th.
[38:54] Let me put that clearly because somebody
[38:57] might say 17 or he say seven. So let me
[39:00] make sure we get it clear. September 7.
[39:08] We clear there.
[39:09] Not 17. September 7. That's where we got
[39:13] the married couple meeting. Amen. So I
[39:16] already sent you a preview of what is
[39:19] coming up. You saw it on the chat. So,
[39:21] make sure you just blend into what you
[39:25] see.
[39:26] You know what I'm saying, right?
[39:29] Amen.
[39:31] We just want to make something really,
[39:33] really, really nice. And uh brother
[39:36] Brham used to say that uh he was taking
[39:41] his time
[39:43] preaching the message to have the
[39:46] message recorded because he knew that
[39:49] the message will go out somewhere else.
[39:52] That's it.
[39:52] Amen. So he had to take his time to lay
[39:55] the material pretty good. So we will
[39:58] have wave if the Lord Jesus Christ t of
[40:02] married couple. So sooner a lot of the
[40:05] young folks will get married.
[40:07] Then the other generation will come back
[40:10] later and then they get married and
[40:12] things. So I'm going to try my best
[40:15] to take my time and lay down everything
[40:19] and it will be recorded and kept for the
[40:22] church. So whoever will get married in
[40:25] the future,
[40:27] we will just find maybe I have to bless
[40:29] five, six, seven marriage in one time or
[40:32] within the same month
[40:34] or within two, three, four months. We
[40:37] just get you all sit in one side.
[40:40] Yes sir.
[40:45] Amen.
[40:47] We will just get sister so and so,
[40:49] sister so and so, sister so and so, or
[40:51] brother so and so. We put you together
[40:53] and we play all those tape.
[40:55] Yes sir.
[40:55] And you get the missing 20%.
[40:58] Yes sir.
[41:00] [Applause]
[41:01] We clear because if not I have to preach
[41:04] it over and preach it over and preach it
[41:07] over and this is very detailed because
[41:09] the question that are coming up are very
[41:12] deep.
[41:15] Amen. Amen.
[41:17] And I want to make sure when I finish
[41:19] this, you will never go to the internet.
[41:25] Amen.
[41:26] Amen.
[41:27] Amen.
[41:27] Amen.
[41:28] Amen.
[41:28] We don't know what the internet is
[41:30] doing. A lot of damage
[41:32] in people's life.
[41:34] Amen.
[41:35] I did it to the young people to block
[41:37] them from accessing that area.
[41:40] You don't need to go watch pornography.
[41:43] No sir.
[41:44] Amen.
[41:46] Adam did in
[41:48] Abraham did in
[41:50] David did in
[41:52] all over the scripture they did in how
[41:54] did they leave?
[41:55] Amen.
[41:57] Amen.
[41:58] Amen. Glory to God.
[41:59] You see what I'm saying? So I want to
[42:01] make sure I'm going to take my time. If
[42:03] it takes one subject take 10 part and so
[42:05] be it.
[42:06] So give me my time. I'm going to go in
[42:08] detail and lay it lay the foundation the
[42:11] scripture and go to science and go back
[42:14] to the court until we get the full thing
[42:17] laid there and kept for the church.
[42:19] So when you ready to get married you
[42:21] just give us a call and we find you a
[42:24] private session and we get you the
[42:27] material and you load it up and you move
[42:29] on. We clear?
[42:30] We happy?
[42:33] Praise God. If somebody's waiting to
[42:35] say, "Where is the court about this?
[42:37] What are you doing about this? Where did
[42:39] you get this authority about this?"
[42:40] Don't worry. When you get to the married
[42:42] couple, that's what I will start firing
[42:45] first.
[42:48] To make sure I clear the smoke
[42:49] completely off, then we can soak in the
[42:52] material because if I bring the
[42:54] material, the devil will continue to
[42:55] play with your mind. That's right.
[42:57] So, we need to clear that up. Amen.
[42:59] Brother Brham even said something and he
[43:02] never gave a scripture about it and I
[43:05] repeated it because brother Brandham
[43:07] said it and I have a full confidence in
[43:08] brother Brham
[43:09] and in the message of the hour and soon
[43:11] and recently the Holy Spirit unfolded to
[43:14] me. He was right there
[43:16] in the scripture.
[43:18] The prophet is always perfectly in line
[43:22] with the Bible. He was right there in
[43:24] the scripture. And the and when I'm
[43:25] going to tell you that in a merit
[43:26] couple, some of you will scream
[43:30] because I'm going to pull it from the
[43:32] Bible.
[43:32] Amen.
[43:33] And you will be like, "Huh? Yes, it's
[43:35] coming from the Bible. You can't fight
[43:37] me. It's coming from the Bible."
[43:40] Amen. Amen.
[43:42] There is so much things laid in this
[43:44] message. We don't need to go outside and
[43:47] read this and read this and read this
[43:50] and go get books and you're going to
[43:52] have a whole library at home when God
[43:55] give you the message of the hour.
[43:56] So let's get deep into the message of
[43:59] the hour. Enjoy the resources that the
[44:02] God have already provided
[44:04] for our marriage, for our finances,
[44:08] for our spiritual life and for every
[44:10] aspect of our life. We clear
[44:14] we happy.
[44:15] We happy.
[44:16] Amen.
[44:16] So I won't put it on YouTube because you
[44:18] will say, "Hey, it's on YouTube." No,
[44:20] I'm dealing with married people. So it's
[44:22] a different territory. We talk like
[44:25] adult.
[44:27] Amen. and we go through the scripture
[44:29] and we pull it from the scripture and
[44:31] you will be amazed of things that is
[44:33] coming up from this message
[44:36] because when we pull a quote you'll be
[44:37] like huh okay yes it's coming from
[44:39] brother Brandham so you can't fight it
[44:41] you just have to swallow it if you need
[44:43] some intubation we will sedate you and
[44:46] make sure you there but you still can
[44:48] get the material soaked in amen so make
[44:51] sure you on time
[44:54] because we're going to start right on
[44:56] time and start moving and cut the eating
[44:58] and move on and get to the material. I
[45:00] already bought a new board like this.
[45:06] So, we got a new board for the married
[45:07] couple.
[45:12] I already bought it. You don't have to
[45:14] worry. It's coming and it's going to be
[45:16] delivered before the seven.
[45:20] So, when you get there, you're going to
[45:21] see a board like this
[45:23] fresh.
[45:25] Pray quickly to get married, my friend.
[45:28] If you can participate to the supper of
[45:31] the married couple.
[45:34] I'm sorry. I'm provoking somebody to
[45:37] jealousy.
[45:40] [Applause]
[45:42] Amen.
[45:43] Pray hard quickly.
[45:45] Uh if they can at least engage you,
[45:48] uh then we can you you can be the last
[45:52] one to ooze in quickly. Brother Stephen,
[45:55] I just got engaged. Can I get there?
[45:59] [Applause]
[46:03] Then we have to verify with the deacon.
[46:05] Is this really correct?
[46:07] [Laughter]
[46:13] We are home my friend.
[46:16] All is well. Anyway, you already got
[46:18] 80%.
[46:19] Amen. Amen.
[46:20] So you pray for me, you pray for the
[46:22] meeting so everything goes well by God's
[46:25] grace and we can move in clearly. Amen.
[46:28] Then on September the 21st, that will be
[46:32] the young sister's meeting and the young
[46:35] man. I'm still waiting on brother Enoch
[46:38] to give me the date and we go ahead and
[46:40] move on from there. Amen.
[46:42] Amen.
[46:42] Now let's go straight to our scripture.
[46:44] I believe I got everything clear.
[46:48] Praise God.
[46:52] you bear with me. My schedule is
[46:54] overloaded.
[46:56] So, I have the team, but I don't have
[46:59] time to go ahead and send it and put it
[47:02] in because it seems like we
[47:06] kind of went to a a different direction,
[47:10] but we're still on the same in the same
[47:12] place. What happened when we got inside
[47:15] Party for House, there was a basement
[47:23] Are you with me?
[47:24] We got into party for house and we were
[47:27] getting ready to go to the prison house.
[47:29] Then in the party for there was a
[47:30] basement. So we come up to open the
[47:33] basement and there were a diamond laying
[47:36] there.
[47:37] So when we chase the diamond, the
[47:38] basement is not the way we thought. We
[47:41] keep digging down.
[47:43] So once we finish, we're going to climb
[47:44] back up again
[47:46] and move to the prison house. Are we
[47:48] together?
[47:49] We clear.
[47:50] You understand my language, right?
[47:52] Praise God. So, we still way down down
[47:54] down. If somebody say, "Where are you?"
[47:56] And we're in beautiful house. Down deep
[47:58] into the basement. Amen. So, our life
[48:02] journey through Joseph 5 garment part
[48:06] 24.
[48:08] Let's go to Psalm 82. Can you see one
[48:10] scripture how we stuck?
[48:16] Amen. Amen.
[48:19] If three verses can hold us like this,
[48:22] what about the whole chapter?
[48:25] That's true.
[48:26] Glory to God.
[48:28] Amen.
[48:28] Amen. And amen.
[48:31] Hallelujah.

[48:37] Heavenly Father, Lord, we approaching
[48:40] you humbly this morning. Father, we
[48:43] thank you for your grace, for your love,
[48:45] for your mercy, and for everything you
[48:47] have been doing for us. And even the
[48:49] ability to be able to come to church to
[48:52] stand before the precious of the blood
[48:55] of the lamb, Lord, and to be able to
[48:57] even speak that which I have spoken. You
[49:00] only take your grace to be able to do
[49:02] that. Father, I'm a human being very
[49:05] limited to my own ability. And your
[49:08] prophet taught us to master the human
[49:10] element. Father, may you come and move
[49:12] me completely out of the way. May you
[49:15] also move the audience visible and
[49:17] invisible out of the way. May you come
[49:20] Lord Father and speak to us. May you be
[49:22] the one preaching, the one interpreting,
[49:25] the one revealing so that Lord Father
[49:28] when we leave this place, we can say
[49:30] like the disciple on the road through
[49:32] Amayas, didn't our heart burn within us
[49:35] as you spoke with us along the way?
[49:37] Father, may the devil and his army be
[49:40] completely sealed out of this place. May
[49:42] only the Holy Spirit and the elect be in
[49:45] this place, Lord, to bless your children
[49:48] and to fill us and to touch every aspect
[49:50] of our life in the name of Jesus Christ.
[49:54] Amen.
[49:55] Amen.
[49:56] Psalm 82 verse1, very familiar. God, you
[50:02] there brother Benjamin?
[50:02] Amen. stands in the congregation of the
[50:06] mighty. You know who are the mighty.
[50:09] He judges among the gods.
[50:13] We know now who are the gods.
[50:15] Amen.
[50:16] Verse six, you might be seated.
[50:21] I have said
[50:24] it's like a declaration.
[50:27] Ye are God's.
[50:29] Glory to God. Verse six doesn't have
[50:32] anything to do with
[50:35] humanity
[50:37] as far as the carnal part.
[50:41] I don't know if we together.
[50:44] Verse six
[50:46] deals with the divine part.
[50:52] Amen.
[50:53] This is God speaking and God say ye are
[50:57] gods.
[50:58] Amen.
[50:59] Amen.
[51:01] God's
[51:02] it's a supernatural being.
[51:05] Amen.
[51:06] Amen.
[51:06] Ye are God's and all of you are children
[51:09] of men.
[51:12] The children of what?
[51:14] The most high.
[51:15] So everything in verse six,
[51:17] Amen.
[51:17] is dealing with deity.
[51:19] Amen.
[51:21] Amen.
[51:22] It's dealing with divinity.
[51:25] Amen. Amen.
[51:29] Verse six deal with deity.
[51:34] It's a divine part
[51:38] of us of these gods.
[51:41] Are we together?
[51:42] Amen.
[51:42] Put your seat belt my friend.
[51:44] You heard the the song about the blood.
[51:48] It doesn't come up like that. I already
[51:50] told you songs are prophetic.
[51:52] That's right.
[51:53] So keep really really good. I don't know
[51:55] how far we going to soar because the
[51:58] devil hate what is coming up here.
[52:04] Amen.
[52:05] Amen.
[52:06] Amen.
[52:06] Amen.
[52:07] We talked yesterday about when to speak
[52:09] the word
[52:11] about the third P yesterday in question
[52:13] and answer. When to speak the word
[52:15] and how to speak it.
[52:16] Amen.
[52:17] We went through that.
[52:18] Yes, we did.
[52:19] Amen. But still the devil will trouble
[52:21] you.
[52:23] Amen.
[52:24] Let's see where we can go. Amen.
[52:27] I have said ye are gods
[52:32] and all of you are children of who?
[52:35] The most high.
[52:37] Verse seven. Now deal with the human
[52:39] part.
[52:42] Amen.
[52:42] Amen.
[52:43] But
[52:45] you shall die like what?
[52:47] It's a mortal part.
[52:50] God don't die.
[52:53] Are we clear?
[52:54] Amen.
[52:55] Verse seven, deal with the human part.
[53:00] Amen.
[53:00] Amen.
[53:02] So we talking about individual who are
[53:04] dual.
[53:08] They are gods.
[53:10] And they are also human.
[53:12] The Greek were trouble trying to
[53:14] understand these things.
[53:16] Amen. Amen.
[53:17] And they came up with Greek mythology
[53:19] and all kind of stuff
[53:21] trying to show how can God Hercules can
[53:23] be a human and can be God because there
[53:26] were trouble with this thing.
[53:29] But there is a truth somewhere.
[53:31] Amen.
[53:32] A human being could be also a God.
[53:37] Jesus was 100%
[53:39] God and 100% man.
[53:49] And if I want to shock you more,
[53:52] Amen.
[53:53] after the resurrection,
[53:55] after the glorification,
[53:58] Jesus could eat natural food.
[54:03] Amen.
[54:04] And disappear.
[54:09] Are we together?
[54:10] Amen. The element of the glorified body
[54:14] are different than the element of the
[54:16] natural body.
[54:18] Amen.
[54:19] But when the natural element were
[54:21] swallowed by Jesus Christ,
[54:24] they went through a process
[54:26] until when Jesus disappeared, what he
[54:29] ate also disappeared.
[54:35] [Applause]
[54:39] This is strong meat, my friend.
[54:41] Yes, sir.
[54:42] Amen.
[54:43] Amen.
[54:44] The devil is fighting barefisted. We
[54:48] also are fighting barefisted.
[54:51] So, we don't have time to play with
[54:53] gospel, gospel, gospel. We lay the
[54:56] message of the hour.
[54:57] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[55:00] Are we together?
[55:02] Amen.
[55:02] Are we together?
[55:03] Amen.
[55:08] Because you thought when he ate the
[55:10] fish, if he disappear, you will see
[55:12] pieces of fish laying there.
[55:14] No, he takes the pieces of fish with
[55:16] him.
[55:18] That fish before he entered Jesus will
[55:20] could not disappear.
[55:23] But when he entered the body of Jesus
[55:25] Christ, that fish could not disappear.
[55:27] Amen.
[55:29] Amen.
[55:30] And become incorporated in the glorified
[55:34] body.
[55:38] Have I lost somebody?
[55:39] No, sir.
[55:40] Is it too strong?
[55:42] If it's strong, you raise your hand.
[55:47] Are we together?
[55:48] Amen.
[55:48] Are we together?
[55:49] Amen.
[55:49] You will become what God say you will
[55:52] be.
[56:00] As much as it feels like it's
[56:02] impossible,
[56:04] you read this Bible a lot.
[56:07] You memorize this Bible a lot.
[56:10] And you came up with a lot idea. How was
[56:13] Elijah? How was Jesus Christ? How was
[56:16] this? Now your hour has come.
[56:19] You need to become another Bible.
[56:23] Yes.
[56:29] In your neighborhood, people will
[56:32] continue to talk about Jesus,
[56:34] but they have to start also talking
[56:36] about you.
[56:40] [Applause]
[56:45] [Applause]
[56:47] Amen.
[56:48] If not, we keep looking in the past. We
[56:50] keep looking in the and the devil trap
[56:52] us in the message.
[56:54] Brother Brham, brother Brham, brother,
[56:57] brother. Uhhuh. Whatever happened to the
[57:00] messenger is an example.
[57:05] [Applause]
[57:09] Brother Brham say God can never remove
[57:12] somebody if he have not finished with
[57:14] him.
[57:15] So if brother Brham was removed, it
[57:17] means that brother Brham is what?
[57:23] [Applause]
[57:24] Where is your return ministry coming
[57:26] from?
[57:31] I can just use one coat and begin to
[57:34] destroy the whole thing.
[57:37] [Applause]
[57:45] Let's continue. My friend,
[57:47] I'm happy because you studying very
[57:49] good.
[57:50] Amen.
[57:51] Amen.
[57:51] Amen.
[57:52] Amen.
[57:54] Verse seven. But you shall die like who?
[57:57] Amen.
[57:58] So we are mortal. Hallelujah.
[58:01] Oh, glory to God. I love this church.
[58:07] I'm sorry. When I go, I think about you.
[58:09] I think about what makes you happy.
[58:11] That's why I have to upgrade the married
[58:13] couple just to make sure you you get
[58:15] good stuff.
[58:19] Amen.
[58:20] Amen.
[58:21] Okay. The Bible says, "But you shall die
[58:24] like men." Come on,
[58:27] and fall like one of the water,
[58:29] the princes.
[58:30] So these people will not fall
[58:35] until they become princes.
[58:39] Amen.
[58:40] Amen.
[58:42] Amen. Amen.
[58:44] They can't fall like normal people.
[58:48] In other words, the day they going to
[58:50] fall, just know that they have reached
[58:52] the level of a prince.
[58:55] [Music]
[59:00] It's one short scripture like this, my
[59:02] friend, but they are layers into the
[59:04] scripture. They will never die until
[59:07] they became prisoners.
[59:10] Amen. In other words, the devil won't
[59:13] kill you.
[59:15] Hallelujah.
[59:17] Let me put it aside. Death will never
[59:20] strike you
[59:21] until you reach your title.
[59:27] [Applause]
[59:32] Are we together?
[59:34] Are we together?
[59:37] Oh, glory to God.
[59:40] When we talked about the word praise,
[59:43] I'm still catching up.
[59:46] We saw that in Genesis uh 32 talking
[59:49] about Jacob. We found out that it was
[59:52] spoken this about Jacob that that name
[59:55] shall be no more called what?
[59:57] Jacob.
[59:58] Shall be called no more Jacob, but what?
[1:00:01] Israel.
[1:00:02] For as a what?
[1:00:03] A prince. So, Israel means a priest.
[1:00:08] The word Israel means a priest with God.
[1:00:12] Amen.
[1:00:12] Amen.
[1:00:13] Amen.
[1:00:13] Amen.
[1:00:14] Amen.
[1:00:14] So, you won't die until you become
[1:00:17] Israel.
[1:00:19] [Applause]
[1:00:23] And the name Israel in the life of of
[1:00:27] Jacob came with a change.
[1:00:33] As hard as it is to swallow, he came
[1:00:36] when Jacob locked God.
[1:00:42] And overcame God.
[1:00:47] How can you overcome God?
[1:00:51] Hallelujah.
[1:00:52] How can you overcome God?
[1:00:54] Can a human being overcome God?
[1:00:59] So that fight is the fight of God.
[1:01:05] [Music]
[1:01:07] When God
[1:01:11] when gods are fighting then one will be
[1:01:13] the winner.
[1:01:15] [Music]
[1:01:19] Are we together?
[1:01:21] Are we together?
[1:01:22] Amen.
[1:01:23] Are we okay?
[1:01:24] Amen.
[1:01:24] Amen.
[1:01:25] Amen. So Jacob when we receive the name
[1:01:28] of Israel it means that something
[1:01:31] happened
[1:01:32] in Jacob
[1:01:33] because when they left him he was not
[1:01:36] walking the same way
[1:01:40] his work changed
[1:01:42] his spiritual walk change.
[1:01:45] So a priest hair is somebody who have
[1:01:48] received a change. Amen.
[1:01:52] In other words, you will never die until
[1:01:55] you receive a change.
[1:02:01] In other words, God will never take you
[1:02:04] off of this world. If God have not
[1:02:07] changed you yet,
[1:02:09] if God have not changed your walk yet,
[1:02:13] if God have not brought a transformation
[1:02:16] in your life until you are different
[1:02:19] than what you used to be,
[1:02:26] in other word, you will never go to hell
[1:02:30] because once you are changed, you are
[1:02:32] doomed for heaven.
[1:02:34] [Applause]
[1:02:43] Uh
[1:02:44] let's look at the word priest.
[1:02:48] Brother Brham says Jacob when he was
[1:02:51] born being a what?
[1:02:53] She called him what
[1:02:54] supplants
[1:02:55] he was not God
[1:02:57] Jacob. But when he got his what?
[1:03:00] Overcoming power
[1:03:02] and did what?
[1:03:03] And wrestled with the angel.
[1:03:04] God changed his name from Jacob to what?
[1:03:07] Israel.
[1:03:08] Which means what?
[1:03:09] A prince.
[1:03:10] The name has something to do with your
[1:03:12] life.
[1:03:17] When Peter a fisherman had done what?
[1:03:20] Overcome.
[1:03:20] By his faith in Jesus Christ, he said,
[1:03:23] "Your name is what?"
[1:03:24] Simon.
[1:03:25] But I'm going to call you what? Peter,
[1:03:27] which is what?
[1:03:28] All right.
[1:03:29] So these people won't die until they
[1:03:32] overcame.
[1:03:35] That's why in the end of every church
[1:03:38] age, he said to him that
[1:03:41] so you won't die without overcoming.
[1:03:49] Are we together?
[1:03:50] Are we together? If you see somebody too
[1:03:53] quiet, make sure they're not sleeping.
[1:03:55] Amen.
[1:03:56] Are we okay?
[1:03:57] Make sure they are here.
[1:03:59] And brother Brandham say but he says it
[1:04:02] does what?
[1:04:03] It changes you.
[1:04:04] Your name has something to do with it.
[1:04:07] And your what?
[1:04:08] Placement in life.
[1:04:12] So you won't die until you reach your
[1:04:15] adoption.
[1:04:16] Amen.
[1:04:17] Until you reach your placement.
[1:04:19] Uhhuh.
[1:04:20] You won't die.
[1:04:21] Amen. And the very name priest comes
[1:04:24] means Israel.
[1:04:28] Brother Brham says this. Glory to God.
[1:04:31] He says now Israel is different.
[1:04:36] Israel and Jew is all together
[1:04:39] different.
[1:04:40] Every Jew is not an Israelite.
[1:04:44] [Music]
[1:04:46] Jew means you came from Judea.
[1:04:49] But it doesn't mean you Israelite.
[1:04:51] Brother Brandham said no, it's just a
[1:04:53] what?
[1:04:54] A Jew.
[1:04:54] Paul never say all Jew will be
[1:04:57] saved.
[1:04:58] But he say what?
[1:04:59] All Israel will be saved.
[1:05:01] Why? Israel name. That is the name of
[1:05:05] what?
[1:05:05] Redemption.
[1:05:07] Hallelujah.
[1:05:10] So you won't die until you receive your
[1:05:13] name of redemption.
[1:05:18] Amen.
[1:05:20] Did you get that one?
[1:05:22] Amen.
[1:05:22] You won't die until you become a priest.
[1:05:25] A priest is Israel. Israel is the name
[1:05:28] of redemption.
[1:05:30] So you won't die until you receive your
[1:05:33] name of redemption.
[1:05:42] Let me say this my friend.
[1:05:45] Glory to God. Brother Brandham say there
[1:05:48] is not another name
[1:05:51] where
[1:05:51] under heaven
[1:05:53] given among who
[1:05:54] man
[1:05:55] whereby there must be what?
[1:05:56] Saved.
[1:05:57] He is God's name of what?
[1:06:00] Redemption.
[1:06:03] Amen.
[1:06:04] Who is the he?
[1:06:05] Hold on.

[1:06:09] Jehovah Gyra
[1:06:10] and water.

[1:06:12] and water. Jehovah Gyra
[1:06:14] meaning what?
[1:06:15] The Lord forgives all thy sins.
[1:06:17] And what?

[1:06:19] which means what?
[1:06:20] The Lord heals all thy de.
[1:06:22] He had what?

[1:06:33] He's got how many name?
[1:06:35] One name.
[1:06:36] One name of what?
[1:06:37] Redemption.
[1:06:38] That belongs to the what?
[1:06:40] The human race. And that is the name of
[1:06:42] what?
[1:06:43] Jesus.
[1:06:44] So you won't die until you become Jesus.
[1:06:59] in the rapture.
[1:07:03] [Laughter]
[1:07:08] In the rapture, Jesus is looking for
[1:07:11] Jesus.
[1:07:13] [Applause]
[1:07:19] When Jesus meet Jesus, then Jesus said
[1:07:22] this is now born of my bone and what
[1:07:26] flesh of my flesh.
[1:07:27] This is me.
[1:07:30] [Applause]

[1:08:53] You shall die like men and you will fall
[1:08:55] like princes. That princess have a
[1:08:58] mystery.
[1:08:59] The problem is you looking at the fall.
[1:09:04] The devil is showing you fall.
[1:09:07] He doesn't show you priest prince
[1:09:10] priest. If a priest fall, is it a
[1:09:12] problem?
[1:09:13] No.
[1:09:14] There is a 911.
[1:09:16] It is not nobody falling. It's a priest.
[1:09:20] The king must react.
[1:09:22] [Applause]
[1:09:26] The falling of a priest require a king.
[1:09:29] That's why God have to leave heaven.
[1:09:32] Because priests were in trouble.
[1:09:36] [Applause]
[1:09:40] Oh, glory to God.
[1:09:43] How many priests and priests do we have

[1:10:05] It is the name of redemption.
[1:10:11] Do you know redemption? Do you know
[1:10:13] redemption means what?
[1:10:15] It means you are somewhere
[1:10:17] and you went to another part and we
[1:10:19] trying to bring you back.
[1:10:22] It is a name that bring you back.
[1:10:27] Hallelujah.
[1:10:28] [Music]
[1:10:29] It it it is a system that God put in
[1:10:33] you. that at a certain time God from
[1:10:37] heaven will send a signal
[1:10:40] and that system will activate.
[1:10:43] That's why the prodical son could go
[1:10:45] home.
[1:10:46] As much as you can go when that system
[1:10:50] kick, no matter how much devil
[1:10:53] have hold you,
[1:10:55] you going to go home.
[1:10:58] [Applause]
[1:11:05] Your problem is we dying like men.
[1:11:10] That's what the devil does is is so
[1:11:13] popular about it.
[1:11:14] Dying, dying, falling, falling, falling,
[1:11:17] falling. There is a mystery to fall.
[1:11:20] [Music]
[1:11:27] You see, we are still on one scripture.
[1:11:34] You know the book of redemption
[1:11:36] was in the hand of Adam.
[1:11:41] Brother, please go read the message.
[1:11:43] Come on, man. The book of redemption was
[1:11:45] with Adam.
[1:11:48] Do you know that?
[1:11:50] Do you know that?
[1:11:51] Brother Brham said that
[1:11:53] I have the code.
[1:11:55] Okay, just trust me. after the church, I
[1:11:58] will send you the code.
[1:12:00] Okay. The book of redemption was with
[1:12:02] Adam.
[1:12:03] Adam was a human being like you.
[1:12:06] [Applause]
[1:12:07] Are we together? When Adam sin,
[1:12:11] that book could not go to the devil.
[1:12:14] He went back again to who?
[1:12:17] To God who is the original owner. So the
[1:12:21] book of redemption
[1:12:23] only can travel between gods.
[1:12:28] [Applause]
[1:12:30] [Laughter]
[1:12:32] [Applause]
[1:12:41] [Laughter]
[1:12:44] [Applause]
[1:12:48] I know some of you didn't get what I'm
[1:12:50] saying.
[1:12:52] Some of you are saying, "Why are they
[1:12:54] cheering like that?"
[1:12:56] The book of redemption cannot all fall
[1:12:59] in the hand of anyone
[1:13:01] only a god.
[1:13:04] [Applause]
[1:13:05] This message belong to God.
[1:13:10] [Applause]
[1:13:19] I'm trying to move forward.
[1:13:22] How many knows what happened in Sabino
[1:13:24] Canyon?
[1:13:26] How many knows
[1:13:28] the sword of the king he
[1:13:33] and a voice said that is the sword of
[1:13:36] who?
[1:13:38] Hallelujah.
[1:13:40] That is the sword of what?
[1:13:44] Brother Brham say not a king
[1:13:47] but what
[1:13:48] the king. In other words, there is only
[1:13:50] one king.
[1:13:54] Do you follow me?
[1:13:55] Do you follow me?
[1:13:56] Hallelujah.
[1:13:57] That sword
[1:13:58] belong to God.
[1:14:02] The one who manufactured that sword
[1:14:05] is God.
[1:14:06] And God manufactured that sword for him.
[1:14:09] Amen.
[1:14:10] But when that sword hit brother
[1:14:14] who is not the god
[1:14:16] but a god
[1:14:18] the sword his head.
[1:14:22] Hallelujah.
[1:14:24] So the
[1:14:26] Oh God have mercy. Have I lost you? In
[1:14:29] the back there. Have I lost you? In
[1:14:31] other words when you take that sword you
[1:14:34] put it in the hand of Jesus it fits.
[1:14:37] He say click.
[1:14:39] If you take it, you put it in the hand
[1:14:41] of a molar like brother Brham, it says
[1:14:44] also click,
[1:14:49] but it's not the soul of brother
[1:14:51] Brandham. It is deity clicking with
[1:14:54] deity.
[1:14:55] [Applause]
[1:15:03] That's why you and this message click.
[1:15:10] [Applause]
[1:15:16] Glory to God.
[1:15:18] Glory to God.
[1:15:20] Hey.
[1:15:22] Oh my God.
[1:15:27] But do you know what we looking at?
[1:15:29] They fall.
[1:15:31] They fall. They fall. They fall. Now I'm
[1:15:34] going to jump
[1:15:36] at the end and then I'm going to come
[1:15:37] back again because somebody's looking at
[1:15:40] the fall. The fall. The fall. Let's look
[1:15:42] at the fall.
[1:15:43] Okay. Before I move forward
[1:15:45] because I'm here to deal with the fall.
[1:15:47] Okay. Let's look at just a parenthesis.
[1:15:50] Okay.
[1:15:51] I'm just going to talk a little just two
[1:15:52] minutes right about the fall. Okay.
[1:15:56] When Adam heard the book of redemption,
[1:16:00] follow me carefully.
[1:16:02] Adam was sinless.
[1:16:09] Do you follow me?
[1:16:11] Do you follow me?
[1:16:12] And when Adam sinned,
[1:16:14] Amen.
[1:16:14] Amen.
[1:16:16] Follow me carefully.
[1:16:17] The book of redemption left Adam.
[1:16:22] Amen.
[1:16:22] In other words, Adam now is categorized
[1:16:25] as a sinner.
[1:16:26] That's right.
[1:16:28] Are you Are we together? The book left
[1:16:30] Adam and went back to a man that have
[1:16:34] not sinned.
[1:16:36] He went back to God.
[1:16:37] And it seems like that book only operate
[1:16:40] where there is no sin.
[1:16:42] But in Revelation 10,
[1:16:45] [Applause]
[1:16:49] let me go slowly this time.
[1:16:52] The book of redemption was in the hand
[1:16:54] of Adam without sin. And Adam was not
[1:16:58] born by sex.
[1:17:04] Yes, sir.
[1:17:05] Are we together?
[1:17:06] And the book went to Christ,
[1:17:09] and Christ was not born by sex. But in
[1:17:13] Revelation 10
[1:17:15] [Applause]
[1:17:20] when the book came,
[1:17:23] the one who brought it is Christ
[1:17:26] without sin,
[1:17:29] without sex
[1:17:30] to give it to John,
[1:17:33] born in sin,
[1:17:35] shaped in iniquity, born in sex,
[1:17:40] [Applause]
[1:17:42] In other words, Adam is even generous of
[1:17:45] us
[1:17:47] because when he sin, God took the book,
[1:17:50] but me and you with our sins.
[1:17:54] [Applause]
[1:17:57] I don't know if you getting what I'm
[1:17:59] saying. I don't know if you in other
[1:18:01] words, Revelation 10 made the difference
[1:18:05] to bring the book to sinners.
[1:18:11] [Applause]
[1:18:12] John s
[1:18:15] he had to be converted.
[1:18:17] He was born by sex. For the first time,
[1:18:20] the book is hiding the hand of somebody
[1:18:23] born by sex.
[1:18:27] Not in the age of
[1:18:34] not in the age of arenous. There is a
[1:18:38] specific people born by sex
[1:18:41] that can handle the book like Adam.
[1:18:44] [Applause]
[1:18:47] Amen.
[1:18:49] [Applause]
[1:18:54] That's why Paul without you sir
[1:18:58] cannot be perfect.
[1:19:00] [Applause]
[1:19:04] The Paul that you read in the Bible is
[1:19:06] waiting for you.
[1:19:08] If you don't reach where you supposed to
[1:19:10] be, Paul is still waiting.
[1:19:16] [Applause]
[1:19:21] Are we together?
[1:19:23] Hey,
[1:19:25] don't worry. You going to understand
[1:19:26] this. It was just a parenthesis.
[1:19:28] We will come back to that.
[1:19:30] Where are we at, my friend?
[1:19:33] Verse seven.
[1:19:34] These guys die like princes.
[1:19:41] Let's go to the second scripture. Luke
[1:19:43] 15,
[1:19:44] where we were last week.
[1:19:52] I thought I'm going to go boop.
[1:20:02] Thank you, Lord.
[1:20:02] You have a We have a big problem,
[1:20:06] a big message,
[1:20:11] and the devil is using just one thing
[1:20:13] to turn us down,
[1:20:17] the fall.
[1:20:18] But we going to deal with it.
[1:20:22] Luke uh uh 15. If you there, you can say
[1:20:24] amen.
[1:20:25] Amen.
[1:20:25] We read this scripture last Sunday.
[1:20:28] Okay. We just refreshing and move on. We
[1:20:30] there.
[1:20:30] Amen.
[1:20:31] Verse 17.
[1:20:33] And when he came to himself, you know
[1:20:36] what it means.
[1:20:36] Uhhuh.
[1:20:37] Huh?
[1:20:38] Amen.
[1:20:38] You know what you mean, right?
[1:20:41] And he said, how many what?
[1:20:43] Hired servants.
[1:20:45] You understand this now? He's looking at
[1:20:47] the servant
[1:20:49] at the position of the angels.
[1:20:53] I wanted to send you all these quotes so
[1:20:55] I can move on.
[1:20:57] I say no, no, let me put it together.
[1:20:58] Let's go together.
[1:20:59] Amen.
[1:21:00] Amen.
[1:21:01] How many hired servant of my fathers
[1:21:04] have what
[1:21:05] bread enough
[1:21:06] to spare and I perish with what?
[1:21:08] With hunger.
[1:21:09] So these servant were taken care of very
[1:21:11] good
[1:21:14] and the boy witnessed that.
[1:21:17] that the the servant
[1:21:19] have things in abundance.
[1:21:21] If a servant have already things in
[1:21:23] abundance, how was that? How was that
[1:21:26] son?
[1:21:30] Let's continue verse 18.
[1:21:32] He said, I will arise and go to my
[1:21:35] father
[1:21:36] and we say to him, father, I have sinned
[1:21:41] therefore.
[1:21:43] Amen.
[1:21:44] Okay.
[1:21:45] Very good. Amen. Against heaven and
[1:21:48] before you.
[1:21:50] And I'm no more worthy
[1:21:53] to be called your son. Who told you
[1:21:56] you're not worthy?
[1:22:00] Because of the sin that he did.
[1:22:05] Amen.
[1:22:06] Amen.
[1:22:08] Glory to God. I'm no more worthy to be
[1:22:11] called your son. Make me as one of your
[1:22:14] water. hired servants.
[1:22:16] So if you sin, you move from a sunship
[1:22:19] position to a servant.
[1:22:26] I'm asking you
[1:22:27] because there is a when when you a son
[1:22:30] there is something that goes with son
[1:22:33] and when you a servant there is
[1:22:35] something that goes with a servant.
[1:22:37] So if you go under servant you got
[1:22:39] limitation.
[1:22:42] A servant cannot come and sleep on the
[1:22:45] chest of his uh his boss.
[1:22:48] When he talk to the boss, it's always a
[1:22:50] distance.
[1:22:51] But a son can do that.
[1:22:54] That's why John could sleep on
[1:23:00] [Applause]
[1:23:02] a grownup man sleeping on.
[1:23:08] You need to read between the line, my
[1:23:09] friend.
[1:23:11] This is papa.
[1:23:14] It's papa.
[1:23:18] Who do they give the book of redemption
[1:23:20] to? Bar telling me
[1:23:22] to who?
[1:23:26] [Laughter]
[1:23:29] Hallelujah.
[1:23:30] Amen. The Bible says verse uh 19, I'm no
[1:23:35] more worthy to be called your son. Make
[1:23:37] me as one of your what?
[1:23:39] Higher servant.
[1:23:40] And he arose and came to the father to
[1:23:42] his father. But when he was yet a great
[1:23:46] w of we know this now.
[1:23:48] His father saw him and had water.
[1:23:52] And ran and fell on him. Amen. Fell on
[1:23:55] his neck and did what?
[1:23:57] And kissed him.
[1:23:57] We know what it means. Amen.
[1:24:00] Verse 21. And the son said to him,
[1:24:02] "Father, I have sinned against heaven
[1:24:06] and in your sight, and I am no more
[1:24:09] worthy to be called your what?"
[1:24:10] Son,
[1:24:13] who is taking himself out of the
[1:24:16] sunship,
[1:24:19] the son himself
[1:24:22] is taking himself out.
[1:24:24] The father didn't say anything.
[1:24:28] He should have even given the father a
[1:24:30] chance.
[1:24:31] I have s I mean to to speak and say I
[1:24:33] have sinned
[1:24:34] and you and you shut up.
[1:24:38] But you don't want to stop there. You
[1:24:40] don't want to hush. You want to
[1:24:41] continue.
[1:24:42] Uh father take me down and don't
[1:24:44] consider me as a son.
[1:24:46] Do you have a law from the house that
[1:24:48] say the day you going to sin you're not
[1:24:50] going to be a son?
[1:24:52] Where you coming with that?
[1:24:56] Follow me my friend.
[1:24:58] We going to get there. Amen. Follow me
[1:25:00] carefully. Amen. And then he says verse
[1:25:03] uh 22, but the father said to who?
[1:25:07] His servants.
[1:25:13] So when the son was talking,
[1:25:17] the servant were there.
[1:25:21] My friend, my friend, don't start like
[1:25:23] this again.
[1:25:26] Hallelujah.
[1:25:28] When the son was talking,
[1:25:30] the servant were there.
[1:25:32] Yes sir.
[1:25:33] And probably the servant heard
[1:25:38] that ah the son is saying that he and us
[1:25:41] we become together
[1:25:43] and the father have to correct
[1:25:47] because the word
[1:25:49] always correct the error.
[1:25:57] Amen.
[1:25:57] Amen.
[1:25:59] Thank you Lord.
[1:26:00] Speak.
[1:26:02] If you if the son has become the
[1:26:05] servant,
[1:26:06] can the servant do service to him?
[1:26:10] The servant do service only to the son
[1:26:12] or to the boss.
[1:26:15] But when the son say I'm not worthy to
[1:26:17] be called your son.
[1:26:19] Put me as the servant.
[1:26:21] God the father turned to the servant.
[1:26:23] Yes.
[1:26:24] And as the servant
[1:26:26] to do service to the son.
[1:26:30] [Applause]
[1:26:32] In other words, the the father wanted
[1:26:35] the angel,
[1:26:36] the servant to understand
[1:26:40] [Music]
[1:26:41] that regardless of what he's saying,
[1:26:47] I am the boss.
[1:26:50] [Applause]
[1:26:56] I don't know if you're getting what I'm
[1:26:58] saying.
[1:26:58] In other words, even if his prayer
[1:27:01] is requesting that you and him to be
[1:27:04] equal,
[1:27:05] I want to make sure you understand.
[1:27:08] I am the one who make the final
[1:27:10] decision.
[1:27:12] My decision he you are still his
[1:27:14] servant. Amen.
[1:27:16] [Music]
[1:27:20] Jesus say if you are ashamed of me
[1:27:23] there we go
[1:27:24] before men
[1:27:26] I will be ashamed of you where
[1:27:29] before whoal
[1:27:32] before
[1:27:34] before
[1:27:36] if you confess me before man I will
[1:27:38] confess you where
[1:27:40] be
[1:27:41] brother Robert before my father and
[1:27:43] the angels
[1:27:44] Why does he want to confess you before
[1:27:46] the angel?
[1:27:48] [Applause]
[1:27:51] Why does he want to confess you before
[1:27:53] the angel?
[1:27:55] What does the angel have to do about
[1:27:57] knowing who you are?
[1:28:01] [Music]
[1:28:03] Are we together?
[1:28:05] Are we together?
[1:28:07] Are we together?
[1:28:08] Amen.
[1:28:08] So when he was talking, the servant were
[1:28:11] there.
[1:28:11] Hallelujah. And the father turned around
[1:28:14] to the servant. He said, "Hey, you
[1:28:19] in other words, do service to him the
[1:28:21] same way
[1:28:22] you were doing before."
[1:28:29] In other words, the father made sure
[1:28:32] the authority is unchanged
[1:28:35] among the servant.
[1:28:39] If God will follow everything that come
[1:28:41] out of our mouth, we'll be in trouble.
[1:28:44] And thank God sometime he just don't
[1:28:46] follow you.
[1:28:50] Amen.
[1:28:52] Amen.
[1:28:52] Amen.
[1:28:53] Let's go, my friend. Where are we at?
[1:28:55] And then verse 22. But the father said
[1:28:58] to his servant, "Bring forth the water,
[1:29:01] the best robe,
[1:29:02] not a robe, the best one,
[1:29:04] and put it on him, and put a ring on his
[1:29:07] hand, and chew on water,
[1:29:09] his feet,
[1:29:10] and bring here what?
[1:29:11] The fatted calf
[1:29:12] and do what?"
[1:29:13] And kill it,
[1:29:13] and let us what?
[1:29:14] Eat and water
[1:29:15] and be married.
[1:29:18] Yes. You know when we look at this
[1:29:20] scripture
[1:29:22] we usually have a tendency to look at
[1:29:25] people who were
[1:29:26] drug addict.
[1:29:30] [Music]
[1:29:32] If I don't do this I won't help you.
[1:29:36] Amen. We look at someone who was on the
[1:29:38] street
[1:29:40] who already have tattoo
[1:29:43] and came back and become a believer. We
[1:29:46] look at somebody who was a prostitute,
[1:29:48] we say that's the prodigal son.
[1:29:51] And it seems like those that never went
[1:29:53] to the nightclub.
[1:29:58] Those that never drunk beer
[1:30:01] think that this prodigy goal story don't
[1:30:03] belong to them.
[1:30:05] [Applause]
[1:30:10] I have to put you there so I can say I
[1:30:12] can rescue you. Yes sir.
[1:30:14] Amen.
[1:30:15] Amen.
[1:30:16] But I have a news for you.
[1:30:20] Whether you were born in ghetto
[1:30:24] or whether you were born in the message
[1:30:30] and I'm going to shock you
[1:30:35] in our natural birth.
[1:30:38] We are not born in the message.
[1:30:41] [Applause]
[1:30:44] We are born at the hospital.
[1:30:52] I'm giving you time to soak in.
[1:30:55] To be born in a message is something
[1:30:57] else.
[1:31:02] All of us were born in a hospital
[1:31:05] or you were born at home. To be born in
[1:31:07] the message is to be born in Christ.
[1:31:16] [Applause]
[1:31:20] Are we together now?
[1:31:22] So whether you were born among the
[1:31:25] parent that are in the message
[1:31:28] or outside the message, here is God's
[1:31:31] declaration.
[1:31:36] The Bible say for what
[1:31:38] all
[1:31:40] how many
[1:31:41] all
[1:31:41] has done what
[1:31:42] have sinned
[1:31:43] and come what
[1:31:44] short of the glory of God.
[1:31:47] Hallelujah.
[1:31:52] It's true. It's true. You never slept
[1:31:56] with a boy.
[1:31:57] Good. Very good.
[1:32:01] But did you
[1:32:03] went around in the kitchen and pulled
[1:32:04] sugar? Johnny Johnny,
[1:32:13] you never drunk beer.
[1:32:15] But you did. Johnny Johnny,
[1:32:18] you know, you know Johnny, right? Yes,
[1:32:20] papa. Taking sugar. No, papa. Telling
[1:32:23] lies.
[1:32:25] Open your mouth.
[1:32:29] So somehow you are a sinner.
[1:32:32] [Applause]
[1:32:34] Are we together? It is just a different
[1:32:37] caliber of sin.
[1:32:40] One smoke,
[1:32:41] but you didn't smoke.
[1:32:43] You never went to the night. But look at
[1:32:46] your computer.
[1:32:48] How many time have you watch
[1:32:49] pornography?
[1:32:53] Look at your cell phone. You never slept
[1:32:56] with a man, but you have a PhD on what
[1:32:59] we do with men.
[1:33:06] So as a conclusion, all have sin.
[1:33:10] [Applause]
[1:33:14] Amen.
[1:33:15] Since we said that issue, all of us are
[1:33:18] prodig
[1:33:21] in the message outside the message. We
[1:33:23] are all prodig
[1:33:27] yourself. God don't have grandchildren.
[1:33:30] Even if you born among the parent of the
[1:33:33] you must be born again yourself.
[1:33:36] [Applause]
[1:33:44] Are we together?
[1:33:46] Are we together?
[1:33:47] So born in the message born outside of
[1:33:50] the message all of our prodigal son.
[1:33:53] We clear now.
[1:33:55] We clear now.
[1:33:56] Are we okay now?
[1:33:58] Let's go to our scripture now.
[1:34:00] Now, nobody will be sitting there like I
[1:34:02] never going to the nightcl
[1:34:05] No, no, no, no, no, no.
[1:34:07] You cheated somehow.
[1:34:09] Ah, you went on a pot at night and
[1:34:11] pulled and then you you did something.
[1:34:14] Mom, I ask you something and then you
[1:34:16] were like this.
[1:34:17] You went to school and you cheated a
[1:34:19] little bit. all of that and then you
[1:34:21] come and say Lord I'm sorry I won't do
[1:34:23] it again but you did something so your
[1:34:25] curriculum v have certain things
[1:34:32] are we together are we together are we
[1:34:35] together because message believer need
[1:34:37] to be shaken
[1:34:39] that's why kids grow up in the message
[1:34:41] without the Holy Ghost and they think
[1:34:43] they have the Holy Ghost and later on we
[1:34:46] will suffer pastor will suffer stubborn
[1:34:49] born hardheaded e I mean lack of
[1:34:52] respect. You hear it from them.
[1:34:56] Why? Because they thought they got the
[1:34:58] Holy Ghost.
[1:35:03] You must be born again.
[1:35:05] All have sinned.
[1:35:07] And because we were sin, we were cut
[1:35:09] short
[1:35:10] of what?
[1:35:11] Glory of God.
[1:35:15] So, how can we go back to the glory of
[1:35:18] God?
[1:35:20] Lord, help me.
[1:35:21] Where are we at, my friend?
[1:35:23] Verse 23.
[1:35:24] 23. And bring here the what?
[1:35:27] The fat of the cal
[1:35:28] and kill it. And let us who do what?
[1:35:30] Eat
[1:35:30] and be water.
[1:35:31] And be married.
[1:35:32] It is strange we are prodical son.
[1:35:36] That when we come to the father, that's
[1:35:40] when he bring the best robe.
[1:35:48] That's when he bring the the ring
[1:35:55] and put even shoes of the gospel of
[1:35:58] preparation.
[1:36:04] How did the father only waited
[1:36:08] until we leave home
[1:36:10] and come back to receive that?
[1:36:17] Maybe you don't understand.
[1:36:19] Let me move my camera a little bit to
[1:36:22] the elder son
[1:36:25] so you will understand better.
[1:36:27] Okay, let me look at the older son.
[1:36:30] Okay,
[1:36:30] we clear.
[1:36:31] Amen.
[1:36:32] We clear?
[1:36:32] Yes, sir. We clear?
[1:36:34] Amen.
[1:36:34] Let me look at the older stone. Jump to
[1:36:36] verse 25.
[1:36:37] The Bible says
[1:36:40] because when he came, Amen.
[1:36:44] the servant saw the servant are the one
[1:36:46] that put the best hope.
[1:36:47] They put the ring and everything and
[1:36:50] they killed the father and come. When he
[1:36:51] came, he heard the music
[1:36:54] and dancing. We already went through
[1:36:56] that.
[1:36:56] That's right.
[1:36:57] Amen.
[1:36:57] Yes, sir.
[1:36:58] And he said he called the servant. He
[1:37:00] said, "What's going on there?"
[1:37:02] And if you notice the servant never told
[1:37:04] him that your brother got a ring.
[1:37:10] Let's read it.
[1:37:11] Let's read it because uh we will be
[1:37:13] Let's go. Verse 25. Now his elder son
[1:37:17] was in the field. And as he came, he
[1:37:20] drew nigh to the house and heard what?
[1:37:23] Music.
[1:37:23] And what?
[1:37:24] And dancing.
[1:37:26] And he called one of the servants. Let
[1:37:29] me leave that alone. and asked what
[1:37:31] these things mean.
[1:37:33] And he said to him, "Your brother is
[1:37:36] come
[1:37:37] and your father has killed the water,
[1:37:39] the fat of the cow
[1:37:40] because he has received him water
[1:37:42] safe and sound.
[1:37:43] Stop." He never told him, "Your brother
[1:37:48] got a best robe.
[1:37:49] Your brother got a ring.
[1:37:51] Your brother, he just went to the fatal
[1:37:53] cuff." The servant say
[1:37:56] get the fatted calf
[1:37:58] and let's see what the fatted calf cost
[1:38:01] to the older son.
[1:38:04] Are we there?
[1:38:06] We there.
[1:38:06] Amen.
[1:38:07] Verse 28. And he was how happy?
[1:38:10] Angry.
[1:38:12] Oh yeah.
[1:38:13] Only the fatted calf
[1:38:15] got him angry.
[1:38:17] If there so so so if the servant would
[1:38:20] have given the full report
[1:38:23] and say he got a ring, he got the best
[1:38:26] robe, he got the only the fed cuff
[1:38:29] already is making him upset.
[1:38:32] So what about the food report?
[1:38:37] He will kill somebody.
[1:38:41] Do you understand?
[1:38:43] Verse 28. And he was angry and will not
[1:38:45] go in. Therefore came his father out and
[1:38:49] intreated him. They begin to plead with
[1:38:51] him.
[1:38:53] Amen.
[1:38:54] But watch his answer. And he answering
[1:38:56] he answering said what
[1:38:58] to his father.
[1:38:59] He said to his father what
[1:39:01] lo
[1:39:02] this what
[1:39:03] many years
[1:39:04] do I serve you neither have what
[1:39:07] transgress
[1:39:08] I at what
[1:39:10] any time
[1:39:10] your what
[1:39:11] thy commandments
[1:39:13] I didn't say anything.
[1:39:15] In other words the older son was almost
[1:39:18] like a sinless man.
[1:39:22] Come on.
[1:39:25] He never transgress the father.
[1:39:28] But the father don't give him the ring.
[1:39:35] The ring is for the one that messed up.
[1:39:41] You You were looking at the fall. I'm
[1:39:43] looking at the fall.
[1:39:46] Amen. The one who never done anything
[1:39:50] stay there without any problem under the
[1:39:52] law very perfect
[1:39:55] don't get the ring
[1:39:57] don't get the best robe
[1:39:58] yes
[1:40:00] the oldest one
[1:40:02] in other way if you trace the oldest
[1:40:04] he's like a Pharisee
[1:40:11] amen but he could not get those stuff
[1:40:15] those stuff went to the younger
[1:40:19] the messed up one,
[1:40:21] the gentile one.
[1:40:23] [Applause]
[1:40:26] Amen.
[1:40:28] Because there are two kids. One is good.
[1:40:31] He's following the law to the other, the
[1:40:33] commandment to the land. Another one is
[1:40:36] like a stubborn one. But it's that one
[1:40:39] that get the stuff.
[1:40:44] Are we together? We clear now. Let's go
[1:40:47] back to verse 24. I want to make
[1:40:49] something. Amen. Verse 24. He says, "For
[1:40:52] my son," this my son was what?
[1:40:54] Was dead
[1:40:55] and is now how?
[1:40:56] Alive again.
[1:40:57] He was what?
[1:40:58] He was lost
[1:40:59] and he's found and they begin to do
[1:41:00] what?
[1:41:01] To be married.
[1:41:01] I'm not preaching to serpent seed, my
[1:41:03] friend.
[1:41:06] Amen.
[1:41:08] Amen.
[1:41:08] Amen.
[1:41:09] Because only God can handle this stuff.
[1:41:13] Listen now my friend
[1:41:15] brother Brandham say the prodigal son in
[1:41:18] closing
[1:41:20] not closing now
[1:41:22] when he had wasted all living the
[1:41:25] father's living with what
[1:41:27] riotist living
[1:41:28] and when he was returning home he was
[1:41:30] laying where
[1:41:31] in a pig pen
[1:41:32] and he came to himself and say what
[1:41:35] how many hired servants my father has
[1:41:37] got
[1:41:38] that has enough to spare and here I am
[1:41:40] dying for
[1:41:42] What if he tried to say, "Wonder if I
[1:41:46] got some money, I could pay that back.
[1:41:51] What I spend in running with
[1:41:54] but he knoweth
[1:41:56] the nature of his father."
[1:42:02] We got to know who we're dealing with.
[1:42:04] Amen. And he said, "I will arise and go
[1:42:08] to my
[1:42:09] father." The father never said, "Wait a
[1:42:12] minute, son. Are you bringing my money
[1:42:14] back?"
[1:42:17] I'm reading brother Brana.
[1:42:18] No, he never charged him for his sins.
[1:42:25] He was glad that he was what?
[1:42:28] Coming back.
[1:42:29] He was glad that he had come to what?
[1:42:31] Himself
[1:42:32] because he was what?
[1:42:33] His son.
[1:42:34] He was what?
[1:42:35] His own child.
[1:42:36] He was glad he was on his road. What?
[1:42:39] Now he didn't endorse his sin.
[1:42:42] But he was glad when he came what?
[1:42:44] To himself
[1:42:45] and said what?
[1:42:46] I have sinned before my God
[1:42:48] and before my father I will arise and go
[1:42:50] to him.
[1:42:52] Let's continue with brother Brham. In
[1:42:54] Hebrew the Bible say but strong meat
[1:42:59] belong to them that are what? of full
[1:43:02] age,
[1:43:03] even to those by reason of use have
[1:43:07] their senses
[1:43:09] exercise to discern what?
[1:43:12] Both good and evil.
[1:43:17] Amen.
[1:43:17] Because the devil told evil.
[1:43:21] I gave you the quote this morning
[1:43:24] that the day you will eat this thing,
[1:43:27] you will be like God. And brother
[1:43:29] Brandham said that was true.
[1:43:35] Don't worry, I don't get amen. Let's go
[1:43:37] to the Bible.
[1:43:41] Let's go to the Bible.
[1:43:45] You think the prophet will say something
[1:43:46] like that.
[1:43:47] Brother Brandham,
[1:43:49] always perfectly in order.
[1:43:51] Let's go to the Bible.
[1:43:53] If you dare, you can say amen.
[1:43:55] Genesis 3.
[1:43:58] If you there you can say amen.
[1:43:59] Amen.
[1:44:00] Verse five. You there?
[1:44:01] Amen.
[1:44:02] For God does know that in the day you
[1:44:06] what?
[1:44:06] Eat there.
[1:44:07] Then your eyes shall be what?
[1:44:10] Open
[1:44:10] and you shall be as
[1:44:12] God
[1:44:12] knowing what
[1:44:14] good and evil.
[1:44:15] Who said this? The devil.
[1:44:17] Right.
[1:44:18] Job to verse 22.
[1:44:22] That was the devil talking.
[1:44:24] Job to verse 22.
[1:44:25] That's right. And the Lord God said,
[1:44:28] "Behold, the man is becoming as what?"
[1:44:32] As one of us.
[1:44:34] Can you read the Bible with me?
[1:44:36] Because when I said some uh
[1:44:39] No, the lie when you going to see the
[1:44:42] court later after church, the lie is
[1:44:44] when he say you shall not die. Brother
[1:44:47] Brandham said that was the lie.
[1:44:49] But brother Brandham said 99 were right.
[1:44:52] I gave you the quote. You're going to
[1:44:54] see it after church. Okay.
[1:44:56] The devil say you going to be like God
[1:44:58] knowing good and what
[1:45:01] now it's God talking.
[1:45:03] Verse 22. And the Lord God say behold
[1:45:06] the man is become as what?
[1:45:08] One of us
[1:45:09] to know what?
[1:45:10] Good and evil.
[1:45:13] Amen.
[1:45:14] Now we clear. So a god,
[1:45:21] this man, this deity,
[1:45:23] God is saying you are God.
[1:45:26] All of you are what? Children of the
[1:45:29] most high, but you must become mortal.
[1:45:35] This is strong.
[1:45:37] And you will experience a fall.
[1:45:40] Yes sir.
[1:45:42] But your experience of a fall will bring
[1:45:45] you into a way to discern good and evil
[1:45:52] because you will judge this earth.
[1:45:56] One day you will judge this earth.
[1:45:58] You must know what is right and what is
[1:46:00] not right.
[1:46:05] Are we together?
[1:46:06] Are we together?
[1:46:07] We clear now.
[1:46:08] We clear now. And Paul is saying that
[1:46:11] strong meat
[1:46:13] belong to the full of age, the mature
[1:46:15] one.
[1:46:16] Because they know how to discern
[1:46:18] from good and evil.
[1:46:20] A child don't know whether that dark
[1:46:22] that candle there burn or not.
[1:46:25] It looks cool.
[1:46:27] Until he touches the fire,
[1:46:30] then he can register and next time he
[1:46:32] will discern.
[1:46:33] He won't be afraid of the candle only.
[1:46:36] But anything that look like a candle
[1:46:42] So the experience of a candle protect
[1:46:45] him from an electrical shock.
[1:46:50] You didn't get it yet.
[1:46:52] If he get an electrical shot, he can
[1:46:54] die.
[1:46:55] But the candle won't kill him
[1:46:58] because he will retrieve the finger
[1:46:59] quickly.
[1:47:00] So they let him touch the candle so he
[1:47:03] will avoid the worst.
[1:47:07] together.
[1:47:08] Are we together?
[1:47:10] We're talking about the fall, my friend.
[1:47:12] Glory to God. Listen, my friend. Brother
[1:47:14] Brandham say, "Our heavenly father, we
[1:47:17] the what?
[1:47:18] The prodigals from the kingdom."
[1:47:20] So, even brother Brandham was a
[1:47:21] prodigal.
[1:47:24] We the prodigal from what?
[1:47:26] The kingdom.
[1:47:26] Stray away. Many of us,
[1:47:29] dear father, we are not fit to be called
[1:47:32] what?
[1:47:32] Your children. You could make you could
[1:47:35] just make us as what?
[1:47:36] You're a hired servant.
[1:47:38] But you don't want us to be your
[1:47:40] servant.
[1:47:41] [Applause]
[1:47:45] Because to begin with, you were not a
[1:47:47] servant.
[1:47:49] Don't worry, my friend. He says you want
[1:47:52] us to be what?
[1:47:53] Your son
[1:47:54] and what?
[1:47:55] And daughter.
[1:47:55] To have what?
[1:47:56] The privileges of home.
[1:47:58] To go in the ice box when we know that
[1:48:02] we are what? home
[1:48:03] when we are what?
[1:48:04] Hungry
[1:48:04] and do what?
[1:48:05] Go eat.
[1:48:06] And when we are what?
[1:48:07] Tired.
[1:48:08] A servant got limitation.
[1:48:12] A servant cannot go to the refrigerator
[1:48:14] and open the refrigerator and drink
[1:48:16] something and just go.
[1:48:18] He cannot do that. And brother Brham is
[1:48:20] saying God don't want you to be servant
[1:48:22] because if you servant you won't be at
[1:48:25] home.
[1:48:26] God wants you to be son and daughters so
[1:48:30] that when you get home you can go to the
[1:48:32] refrigerator and get things whenever you
[1:48:34] want
[1:48:35] and you are free.
[1:48:37] Are we together?
[1:48:38] Are we together?
[1:48:40] Father help me. Brother Brandham said
[1:48:43] how can we stand let anybody call such a
[1:48:47] bad name call you such a bad name? You
[1:48:50] don't live for yourself.
[1:48:53] You live for others
[1:48:54] that you might redeem that man.
[1:48:56] That's right.
[1:48:57] You become what?
[1:48:58] Sons.
[1:49:00] What is son? The trouble of it is the
[1:49:04] church has forgotten
[1:49:06] they were
[1:49:07] sons.
[1:49:08] You are what?
[1:49:10] You are taking Christ place.
[1:49:14] A son meaning you are taking the place
[1:49:18] of Christ.
[1:49:20] I am the son of God. Meaning I'm taking
[1:49:23] the place of God.
[1:49:25] That's why the Jews sayh you calling
[1:49:28] yourself the son of God, we will kill
[1:49:30] you
[1:49:30] because you making yourself God.
[1:49:35] Are we together?
[1:49:36] Are we together?
[1:49:38] Remember, you won't die until you become
[1:49:40] Jesus.
[1:49:42] Are we clear? Are we clear?
[1:49:45] I'm soaring, my friend. I'm coming
[1:49:47] again.
[1:49:48] We found out that in Hebrew that in the
[1:49:51] angel the Bible say but to which of the
[1:49:54] servant the angel said he a what
[1:49:56] any time
[1:49:57] sit on my right hand until I make thy
[1:49:59] enemy what
[1:50:00] thy foottool
[1:50:01] but in Laia we will sit on the throne.
[1:50:03] You know that
[1:50:05] are they not all what
[1:50:06] ministering spirits
[1:50:08] sent forth to do what?
[1:50:09] To minister for
[1:50:10] for them who has been what?
[1:50:12] Heirs of salvation. So the servant will
[1:50:14] remain servant
[1:50:16] and son will remain sons.
[1:50:22] I will get to that.
[1:50:24] Do you know that demons are angels?
[1:50:30] Do you know that demons are angels?
[1:50:33] Yes sir.
[1:50:33] But they just fallen angel
[1:50:35] but they still angel. Amen.
[1:50:37] So if the angel are your servant,
[1:50:40] how watch what are what are demons?
[1:50:46] Because you don't understand. I'm going
[1:50:48] with the fall.
[1:50:49] If the angel, the normal angel, the holy
[1:50:52] angel are your servant. What about the
[1:50:55] fallen angel?
[1:50:59] [Applause]
[1:51:03] Do you understand what I'm saying? When
[1:51:05] you walk, the normal angel walk with you
[1:51:09] for your protection as bodyguard
[1:51:12] but the fallen angel are under your
[1:51:14] feet.
[1:51:17] [Applause]
[1:51:20] I hope we are okay.
[1:51:22] I hope we moving on.
[1:51:26] Oh, glory to God.
[1:51:29] Solomon say something strange.
[1:51:33] Lord, help me.
[1:51:35] Ah,
[1:51:35] I'm good on time.
[1:51:37] Praise God.
[1:51:38] We were integity.
[1:51:40] Solomon,
[1:51:43] I will try.
[1:51:44] I was checking the time. My wife usually
[1:51:46] tells me when you check the time you do
[1:51:48] that, you are wasting time.
[1:51:52] [Applause]
[1:51:55] So, let me continue.
[1:51:58] You got a good lawyer spoken word. A
[1:52:01] hard one.
[1:52:03] [Applause]
[1:52:05] Solomon says something very strange. He
[1:52:09] says, "I have seen servants
[1:52:12] where?"
[1:52:13] On horses,
[1:52:20] Solomon stood and he seen horses
[1:52:23] and he seen people on horses.
[1:52:26] And when Solomon look at them,
[1:52:28] they are servant
[1:52:30] in horses.
[1:52:32] Okay, maybe they send them.
[1:52:34] But let me continue the verse.
[1:52:36] Ecclesiastes 10. And he says, "And I
[1:52:40] seen what?
[1:52:47] You shall die like what?"
[1:52:53] Because the prodigal son want to be like
[1:52:55] a servant
[1:52:57] when he was a priest.
[1:52:58] And Solomon say I sin.
[1:53:01] something. When I look, I see servant
[1:53:05] upon horses
[1:53:07] and princes
[1:53:09] walking
[1:53:11] upon the earth
[1:53:12] as what?
[1:53:13] Servants
[1:53:14] where?
[1:53:15] Upon the earth.
[1:53:16] So this scenario don't happen in heaven.
[1:53:21] Are we together?
[1:53:23] In heaven everything is in order.
[1:53:29] But on the earth, it looks like things
[1:53:31] are upside down.
[1:53:34] Those who are supposed to be ruling
[1:53:41] have been ruled on.
[1:53:45] I don't know if we together.
[1:53:47] Solomon se said that I seen a tragedy in
[1:53:51] the earth.
[1:53:55] I see princes.
[1:53:57] are walking.
[1:53:59] Not just walking,
[1:54:00] they're walking as servants.
[1:54:05] Are we together?
[1:54:07] But when I look a servant, servant are
[1:54:10] on horses. In other word in the earth,
[1:54:16] we dignify,
[1:54:19] respect,
[1:54:21] praise,
[1:54:22] uphold,
[1:54:24] magnify
[1:54:25] angels,
[1:54:30] [Music]
[1:54:32] are we together?
[1:54:34] Are we together?
[1:54:35] And the sons of God, the princes are
[1:54:38] walking on foot.
[1:54:44] [Applause]
[1:54:46] If follow me.
[1:54:48] If a servant
[1:54:51] you know a servant.
[1:54:54] Okay.
[1:54:55] And then you know the the son of the
[1:54:58] boss of the companies.
[1:54:59] Right.
[1:55:00] Okay.
[1:55:01] And for some reason you see that servant
[1:55:04] cranking the car and begin to move and
[1:55:07] you see the son of the company moving.
[1:55:16] Something is wrong.
[1:55:19] If you read the scripture, you will go.
[1:55:21] You don't understand.
[1:55:22] Something must have happened
[1:55:26] to the princes
[1:55:28] that put them in such a position.
[1:55:32] What have happened to the princes
[1:55:34] that they can see the servant on Moses
[1:55:37] and they're fine?
[1:55:44] Are we together?
[1:55:46] Are we together?
[1:55:47] Are we together?
[1:55:49] I searched this quote. I don't remember
[1:55:52] where I got it.
[1:55:53] I thought it was a quote, but I can't
[1:55:55] find it yet.
[1:55:56] So, I'm not going to say it's a quote. I
[1:55:59] don't remember where I read it. I
[1:56:00] thought because usually I spend my time
[1:56:03] reading Brother Brana,
[1:56:04] right?
[1:56:04] But let me just give you the story. If I
[1:56:07] find the code, if it's a court, I will
[1:56:08] give it to you.
[1:56:10] There was a young man, two boys.
[1:56:13] One was older and the one the other one
[1:56:16] was young. So the older one was playing
[1:56:19] with a duck or something.
[1:56:21] Yes.
[1:56:23] Is it brother? I'm trying to f. And then
[1:56:26] he killed the duck.
[1:56:29] Do you follow me? when he killed the
[1:56:31] duck, the younger brother saw him.
[1:56:34] And he said, "Hey, I'm going to tell
[1:56:37] grandma."
[1:56:39] Do you follow me?
[1:56:40] They say, "Please, please, please,
[1:56:42] please, please, please don't tell
[1:56:43] grandma. Please, please, please, please,
[1:56:44] please, please." He say, "Okay, no
[1:56:46] problem." So, whatever I tell you to do,
[1:56:48] you do.
[1:56:51] Do you follow me?
[1:56:53] Do you follow me? So the order changes.
[1:56:58] I don't know if you're getting where I'm
[1:57:00] going.
[1:57:00] So the youngest son will be sitting in
[1:57:03] the table and he say, "Hey Mark, bring
[1:57:06] me this food."
[1:57:09] And they will see Mark coming up
[1:57:11] quickly.
[1:57:12] And they say, "Oh, he love his younger
[1:57:14] brother so much. Look at the love he has
[1:57:17] for his younger brother." And he say,
[1:57:18] "You forgot the water.
[1:57:24] Are we together?
[1:57:25] And it took for a while
[1:57:28] until one day the older son got tired.
[1:57:32] He said, "You know what? This boy is
[1:57:35] taking over me.
[1:57:37] [Applause]
[1:57:39] I don't know if we're getting together.
[1:57:44] Are we there?"
[1:57:45] He's sleeping himself.
[1:57:47] He went to grandma.
[1:57:50] He said, "Grandma, I got something to
[1:57:53] tell you.
[1:57:54] I have to tell you the truth.
[1:57:58] They fall." They fall have a power.
[1:58:03] [Applause]
[1:58:06] He said, "Grandma, I got to tell you the
[1:58:08] truth.
[1:58:09] You know the duck that died the other
[1:58:11] day,
[1:58:12] I am the one that kill it."
[1:58:14] Do you know what grandma say?
[1:58:17] Do you know what grandma say? Grandma
[1:58:19] say when you were killing the duck,
[1:58:22] I was at the window watching you. I knew
[1:58:25] already, but I was watching you to see
[1:58:29] how long you going to let your younger
[1:58:32] brother take advantage of you.
[1:58:43] Do you hear me?
[1:58:44] Do you hear me? I was a prostitute
[1:58:47] before, God saw you.
[1:58:49] I was smoking, God saw you. I lie, God
[1:58:53] saw you. God already saw you. But God is
[1:58:57] watching. How long you going to let the
[1:58:59] devil rule over you?
[1:59:02] [Applause]
[1:59:10] Because of condemnation. If something
[1:59:13] condemn you, go talk to God. And when
[1:59:15] you talk to God, it's over.
[1:59:19] [Applause]
[1:59:25] [Music]
[1:59:28] Are we together? Are we together?
[1:59:32] Young man, listen to me. You walk in
[1:59:35] this church, I don't want to see any of
[1:59:36] you walking like this.
[1:59:39] When you walk in this church, you walk
[1:59:40] like this.
[1:59:41] [Applause]
[1:59:46] Because my sin are under the blood.
[1:59:50] [Applause]
[1:59:54] Amen. Amen. When you see servant taking
[1:59:58] over princes, something happened to the
[2:00:01] princes and they built complexes.
[2:00:04] And we find in the story of the prodigal
[2:00:06] son that because he sin, he want to
[2:00:09] build complexes. They want to be my
[2:00:11] servant.
[2:00:18] Are we together?
[2:00:19] Are we together?
[2:00:21] Are we together? Are we together?
[2:00:31] I can imagine.
[2:00:33] I can imagine after they finished the
[2:00:35] talk with grandma,
[2:00:37] the younger boy came back again.
[2:00:42] I can imagine.
[2:00:44] I can imagine.
[2:00:46] And he say, "Hey, bring me water,
[2:00:51] rightation."
[2:00:53] Boy, you prayed too much with me.
[2:00:58] Today is your day.
[2:01:02] [Applause]
[2:01:04] [Laughter]
[2:01:08] I can imagine the number of days all
[2:01:12] month he was taken over he built such an
[2:01:15] angel. He said boy
[2:01:19] I want you to understand this is the
[2:01:22] last time you touch my child.
[2:01:25] This is the last time you touch my
[2:01:27] family. This is the last time you touch
[2:01:30] this body. This is the last time you
[2:01:33] talk to me like this.
[2:01:35] [Applause]
[2:01:37] Things are happening in order.
[2:01:41] [Applause]
[2:01:48] Things are back in order.
[2:01:50] The message brought things back in
[2:01:52] order.
[2:01:55] [Applause]
[2:01:59] Hey. Hallelujah.
[2:02:02] Hallelujah.
[2:02:03] Hallelujah.
[2:02:04] Hallelujah.
[2:02:05] Oh, glory to God.
[2:02:08] Listen to brother Brham.
[2:02:10] Brother Brham,
[2:02:11] is a ninja a what?
[2:02:13] A higher order
[2:02:14] than a man or a what?
[2:02:16] A lower order.
[2:02:23] Brother is asking a question.
[2:02:26] You and the angel. Who's higher in
[2:02:28] order?
[2:02:29] Let me help. Let let me answer it.
[2:02:34] The Bible said, "But we see who?"
[2:02:36] Jesus
[2:02:36] who was made what?
[2:02:38] A little lower than the angels
[2:02:41] for the suffering of death.
[2:02:43] Crown with what?
[2:02:44] With glory and
[2:02:45] water.
[2:02:46] Let's go slowly.
[2:02:48] Jesus was made how?
[2:02:51] A little lower than what?
[2:02:52] The angel.
[2:02:53] So human being
[2:02:55] [Music]
[2:02:58] by default
[2:03:00] are lower than angel.
[2:03:05] We clear now?
[2:03:06] We clear now.
[2:03:07] But watch the contrast of God.
[2:03:10] When he made Christ a little lower than
[2:03:12] the angel, he didn't stop there.
[2:03:16] Amen.
[2:03:17] For the suffering of water.
[2:03:19] So there was a purpose for Christ to be
[2:03:21] made lower.
[2:03:26] There is a purpose for you to become
[2:03:28] human.
[2:03:30] It is not a weakness.
[2:03:32] It is actually a power.
[2:03:36] Yes, sir.
[2:03:38] Can I continue? And then the Bible say
[2:03:41] and crown with what?
[2:03:43] Glory.
[2:03:43] And what?
[2:03:45] So it's a creature looking lower than
[2:03:47] the angel.
[2:03:49] Amen. But that creature is
[2:03:51] crown.
[2:03:55] It's a very confusing to the devil.
[2:03:57] That's why the devil tempted Jesus
[2:03:59] Christ
[2:04:00] because he knew that hey I'm an angel.
[2:04:04] This is already lower than me.
[2:04:07] And then when he approached, he tried he
[2:04:09] found out there was a glory
[2:04:12] in that man
[2:04:13] that was different than a human being.
[2:04:16] So God made him lower than the angel.
[2:04:19] But he never let him in the inside lower
[2:04:22] than the angel.
[2:04:25] [Applause]
[2:04:28] [Music]
[2:04:30] Verse seven is the one lower than the
[2:04:33] angel.
[2:04:35] But verse six is not lower than the
[2:04:37] angel.
[2:04:38] That's why he made him lower than the
[2:04:40] angel. But he put G inside.
[2:04:44] [Applause]
[2:04:45] He crown him
[2:04:47] with glory
[2:04:49] and honor.
[2:04:50] So it's a confusing being.
[2:04:53] He might be lower
[2:04:55] but he is God.
[2:04:59] [Music]
[2:05:01] Oh my God. He says that by the grace of
[2:05:04] God he should taste what?
[2:05:07] So let's go back to our question. Is the
[2:05:10] angel a higher order than man or a lower
[2:05:13] order?
[2:05:15] Based on this the angel are what?
[2:05:22] Human being built complexes.
[2:05:25] So when we see angel we tremble.
[2:05:29] Let's continue. Brother Brandham said
[2:05:32] all right sir
[2:05:33] because I gave you the answer.
[2:05:35] He said which is the greatest
[2:05:38] a son of God
[2:05:40] a son of God
[2:05:42] or a what?
[2:05:43] Angel. Brother Brandham say a
[2:05:44] what?
[2:05:46] [Music]
[2:05:50] So even though Jesus is lower than the
[2:05:53] angel but when Jesus speak
[2:05:59] every angel back up.
[2:06:03] In other words Jesus was not complexed
[2:06:06] by his skin.
[2:06:10] Even when he approached,
[2:06:12] the devil begin to talk. They say, "What
[2:06:14] we have to do with you?"
[2:06:17] Hallelujah.
[2:06:18] Yes, sir.
[2:06:19] Amen.
[2:06:20] Yes, sir.
[2:06:22] Hallelujah.
[2:06:23] That's why the scriptures say, "Let this
[2:06:25] man
[2:06:27] that was in Christ be also where
[2:06:31] even though he
[2:06:34] in other words, Jesus have to keep
[2:06:36] himself
[2:06:37] constantly that I am God.
[2:06:42] Because the fact that he is a human
[2:06:44] being, the devil will come to tempt him.
[2:06:48] Amen.
[2:06:49] That's why when Satan tempted him, he
[2:06:51] turned around. He said, "Lucifer,
[2:06:54] remember you don't tempt the Lord your
[2:06:56] God.
[2:07:00] [Applause]
[2:07:04] a human being. God
[2:07:09] [Music]
[2:07:14] he says which would God he what
[2:07:21] an angel standing there before him
[2:07:25] pleading for something
[2:07:26] or one of you pleading
[2:07:33] Demons are what?
[2:07:36] Fallen angels.
[2:07:39] But demons can talk to God,
[2:07:46] [Music]
[2:07:49] specific prayer.
[2:07:51] We asking you,
[2:07:54] slow down.
[2:07:57] Do you know what uh what legion mean?
[2:08:01] It's how many devils?
[2:08:04] I don't remember the number again
[2:08:07] whether it was 8,000 or something.
[2:08:09] Amen.
[2:08:10] But when the man was talking, did we
[2:08:13] hear 8,000 voices?
[2:08:15] How many voice were coming up?
[2:08:17] So the demon can join together in one
[2:08:20] in one accord.
[2:08:23] [Applause]
[2:08:28] I don't know if you're getting what I'm
[2:08:30] saying.
[2:08:31] Legion, a congregation of 8,000
[2:08:34] something
[2:08:35] can join together in one accord and
[2:08:38] bring a petition to God
[2:08:44] and God answered them.
[2:08:47] If all of us get together
[2:08:49] in one
[2:08:55] to ask God for something. What will
[2:08:57] happen?
[2:09:04] Fallen angel. God is listening to them
[2:09:07] and they are very specific. Put us on
[2:09:11] the swan.
[2:09:16] And God even asked a spirit. He said,
[2:09:18] "How can you do it?" He said, "I'm going
[2:09:20] to go and be a lying spirit." And God
[2:09:23] say, "Go ahead and do it and you will
[2:09:25] succeed." What about you?
[2:09:30] Hallelujah.
[2:09:31] [Applause]
[2:09:34] How many times the devil asked for Job
[2:09:38] [Music]
[2:09:40] and God gave it to him.
[2:09:45] God giving a devil the permission to
[2:09:48] trouble his son.
[2:09:50] What about his son asking God a
[2:09:53] permission to trouble the devil?
[2:09:59] [Laughter]
[2:09:59] [Applause]
[2:10:04] Are we together?
[2:10:06] Ye are God's.
[2:10:07] [Music]
[2:10:09] Oh spoken word.
[2:10:11] God have mercy. He said which would God
[2:10:14] hear the what?
[2:10:16] An angel standing there before him doing
[2:10:19] what?
[2:10:19] Pleading for something.
[2:10:21] Or are one of you pleading?
[2:10:23] Brother Brandham say one of you are see
[2:10:26] because you are what?
[2:10:28] Sons and daughters.
[2:10:29] They are what?
[2:10:31] You are what?
[2:10:33] Sons and daughters.
[2:10:34] So see what authority you have.
[2:10:37] We are just afraid to use it.
[2:10:41] Listen
[2:10:47] my friend
[2:10:48] brother Brandham say sons and daughter
[2:10:51] who has the most power
[2:10:54] who
[2:10:55] before God.
[2:10:57] What is an angel?
[2:10:59] An angel is what?
[2:11:01] That's right. They are what?
[2:11:04] What are you?
[2:11:07] We are what?
[2:11:08] His son and daughter. Who has the most
[2:11:10] what?
[2:11:11] Power in heaven.
[2:11:12] Power where?
[2:11:13] In heaven.
[2:11:14] On the earth.
[2:11:16] Where?
[2:11:16] In heaven.
[2:11:17] Then a Christian,
[2:11:19] a sinner.
[2:11:23] [Applause]
[2:11:24] It
[2:11:27] let that soak
[2:11:29] they fall.
[2:11:30] Amen. A sinner that has been what?
[2:11:36] Oh, anger.
[2:11:40] Not an angel now. An archangel. An
[2:11:43] archangel that is standing by his what?
[2:11:46] Right side.
[2:11:47] Who is right?
[2:11:49] That has been what?
[2:11:50] Saved by grace.
[2:11:51] Has more what?
[2:11:52] Authority
[2:11:53] in heaven than what?
[2:11:55] The archangel
[2:11:56] that stood by what?
[2:11:58] Without
[2:12:01] Let's read it together again. You didn't
[2:12:04] get that because you were looking at the
[2:12:06] four. They fall, they fall, they fall.
[2:12:09] In other word, when you have a four, you
[2:12:11] already built complexes.
[2:12:12] Angel, archangel are older than me. They
[2:12:15] are powerful than me. Let's see an
[2:12:17] archangel who never sin and you who have
[2:12:19] sinned.
[2:12:20] Brother say the sinner that has been
[2:12:23] saved by water
[2:12:24] has more water
[2:12:26] in heaven than water
[2:12:29] that stood by his side. How
[2:12:32] because he is water.
[2:12:35] Hallelujah.
[2:12:37] [Applause]
[2:12:38] Archangel no sins.
[2:12:41] You sinner
[2:12:42] dead saved by coming back home.
[2:12:46] [Music]
[2:12:51] So when you are coming God forget that
[2:12:54] the air is here.
[2:12:57] [Applause]
[2:13:00] He said he said because you are his son.
[2:13:03] Son has what? No more
[2:13:06] more authority than a servant of curse.
[2:13:10] Oh,
[2:13:11] we forgot
[2:13:13] what we are.
[2:13:14] We forgot
[2:13:15] many times
[2:13:16] what made us
[2:13:18] what we are
[2:13:19] after we become
[2:13:20] what we are.
[2:13:21] Then we forgot what how we got there.
[2:13:26] [Applause]
[2:13:33] You are smoking.
[2:13:35] They took smoking off from you. Now you
[2:13:38] begin to forget the power that move you
[2:13:40] from that place.
[2:13:43] [Music]
[2:13:46] Amen.
[2:13:57] No, it's hard
[2:13:59] if I can go there.
[2:14:03] Let's go to Romans 7.
[2:14:07] Because if I touch John 17, that's it.
[2:14:10] We lost.
[2:14:13] I'm trying to go back to the prayer of
[2:14:15] Jesus.
[2:14:18] Let's go to Romans 7.
[2:14:21] Hallelujah.
[2:14:23] If you dare, you can say amen.
[2:14:26] We're talking about therefore.
[2:14:29] Therefore,
[2:14:30] therefore, knowing good and evil.
[2:14:33] Therefore,
[2:14:34] amen.
[2:14:36] Let's go to verse uh Romans 7 verse 18.
[2:14:39] If you there, you can say amen.
[2:14:40] Amen.
[2:14:43] We there.
[2:14:44] Amen.
[2:14:44] Verse 18. The Bible says, "For I know
[2:14:51] that in me."
[2:14:56] Verse seven, in the board. I know that
[2:15:00] in me.
[2:15:02] In the water,
[2:15:03] flesh.
[2:15:04] In the human part.
[2:15:07] We clear on the board here. In the
[2:15:10] flesh,
[2:15:10] in the human part.
[2:15:13] Remember the trouble is not here.
[2:15:15] Trouble always here.
[2:15:17] The fall is always here.
[2:15:18] The dying is here. Death here. Falling
[2:15:21] here.
[2:15:22] Not over there.
[2:15:23] I know that in me, in my flesh, the
[2:15:26] human part.
[2:15:28] I know that in me, in my flesh, dwell
[2:15:32] what?
[2:15:32] No good thing.
[2:15:36] You know who's good, right?
[2:15:39] Good master.
[2:15:41] Jesus look, he say there is nobody good
[2:15:43] but God.
[2:15:46] So in your flesh
[2:15:50] okay there is no good things for to will
[2:15:55] is present with me
[2:15:57] amen
[2:15:59] but how to perform that which is good I
[2:16:02] find not
[2:16:04] in me I want to do what is right
[2:16:09] but the way I want to do it
[2:16:11] sometime I messed up Let's continue
[2:16:15] because that's where the devil comes
[2:16:17] and say you you are not God.
[2:16:20] You are not God.
[2:16:22] I told you you are not God. Look how you
[2:16:24] struggling.
[2:16:26] Now Paul is dividing things
[2:16:29] because the devil keep coming say you
[2:16:30] are not God.
[2:16:32] You just got upset five minutes ago.
[2:16:34] You're not God.
[2:16:38] Tell the devil you don't even know what
[2:16:40] God means.
[2:16:46] Let me explain you what God means.
[2:16:50] You did that to Eve, not me.
[2:16:54] Not this evil.
[2:16:55] Not me.
[2:16:56] Ah, this is not Eve era. This era, the
[2:16:59] seals are broken.
[2:17:03] Amen.
[2:17:04] He says in verse 19, "For the good that
[2:17:07] I would,
[2:17:09] I do not,
[2:17:11] but the evil which I would not that I
[2:17:16] do." We need to understand this very
[2:17:19] carefully.
[2:17:20] Yes sir.
[2:17:21] So in other word inside of Paul, he
[2:17:24] already hates
[2:17:26] evil.
[2:17:28] Oh God have mercy. Amen.
[2:17:35] Oh, glory to God. This is Paul one.
[2:17:39] This is Paul too.
[2:17:41] Let's call this man the outward man.
[2:17:44] Amen. And let's call this man the inner
[2:17:47] man.
[2:17:48] Amen.
[2:17:49] This is the outward man right here.
[2:17:53] Amen.
[2:17:54] All kind of stuff.
[2:17:57] Amen.
[2:17:58] Paul say in here
[2:18:01] follow me
[2:18:03] nothing good
[2:18:08] amen.
[2:18:09] Amen.
[2:18:10] But in here
[2:18:12] there is something
[2:18:14] in here I love good.
[2:18:19] Amen.
[2:18:20] And I hate
[2:18:23] evil.
[2:18:25] Keep that together. If this guy love
[2:18:28] evil,
[2:18:30] it's a problem.
[2:18:35] Are we together? That's why brother
[2:18:37] Brham say when God judges
[2:18:41] he judges the heart.
[2:18:44] God when he comes he check first inside.
[2:18:48] When God look inside he said the inside
[2:18:51] hate evil
[2:18:52] so you trap him.
[2:18:55] That's right. He didn't mean
[2:18:56] it.
[2:19:03] Let's go slowly, my friend.
[2:19:05] Verse uh 19. For the good that I would,
[2:19:09] I do not.
[2:19:10] By the evil which I would not that I do.
[2:19:14] Paul is saying that inside here I'm
[2:19:16] determined to only do good.
[2:19:18] That's right.
[2:19:19] I don't want to do evil.
[2:19:22] Amen. But I found myself caught in evil.
[2:19:26] But inside of me, that is not what I
[2:19:29] wanted to do.
[2:19:31] And the devil is using that
[2:19:33] and saying you are bad.
[2:19:37] You are not where you're supposed to be
[2:19:39] with the Lord. That's right, brother.
[2:19:43] You've been repenting for all these 20
[2:19:45] years.
[2:19:48] And before you know it, you like this.
[2:19:52] Maybe I guess uh things are not what I
[2:19:54] thought. Let's go verse 21. He says uh
[2:19:58] verse 20. Now if I do that I would not.
[2:20:03] In other words, at the beginning I
[2:20:05] didn't want to do it.
[2:20:07] Not a purpose to do wrong.
[2:20:12] I was not going there to fight.
[2:20:16] I was not going there to argue.
[2:20:19] But I got under the pressure
[2:20:21] and I I found myself yelling.
[2:20:25] But that is not what I went there to do.
[2:20:27] I went to talk to them.
[2:20:33] So your inside is not bad.
[2:20:36] Even though you were caught in a
[2:20:38] yelling,
[2:20:39] but you still not bad.
[2:20:44] Amen.
[2:20:45] Are you understanding me?
[2:20:47] Because the devil will catch you right
[2:20:49] there and say you got upset.
[2:20:51] That's why you are not a Christian.
[2:20:55] That's why you don't have the Holy
[2:20:56] Ghost.
[2:20:58] Because a Holy Ghost man could not
[2:21:00] behave like you did.
[2:21:03] Why do you always come to me about the
[2:21:05] Holy Ghost and Christian?
[2:21:08] [Applause]
[2:21:10] Because you know better.
[2:21:14] So I need to now discern.
[2:21:17] Hallelujah.
[2:21:22] Oh Lord have mercy. Where are we at?
[2:21:24] Verse 20. And if I do that which I would
[2:21:27] not, it is no more I.
[2:21:30] Paul, you the one that did it. Paul say
[2:21:33] me.
[2:21:34] But Paul, we s we we we recorded you.
[2:21:43] If it's too strong, we stop, my friend,
[2:21:45] because this is strong stuff.
[2:21:48] Paul, you the one Paul say it's not me.
[2:21:51] I know my heart.
[2:21:54] I know my heart.
[2:21:55] I know who I am.
[2:21:57] I come to a conclusion. I'm not a bad
[2:21:59] man.
[2:22:01] I know my heart, my friend.
[2:22:03] I never intend evil for somebody. I can
[2:22:06] make mistake, but I'm not bad.
[2:22:09] [Applause]
[2:22:10] When you begin that language, the devil
[2:22:12] knows what you say.
[2:22:16] I'm trying to free you, my friend.
[2:22:19] [Music]
[2:22:21] Because this nature is sticky
[2:22:24] and the devil is shooting constantly
[2:22:26] here
[2:22:28] to bring you under condemnation.
[2:22:33] So you got to have a higher morale
[2:22:41] because he made the Christian journey a
[2:22:44] miserable journey.
[2:22:45] That's right. Yes.
[2:22:48] Where instead of focusing on God, we
[2:22:51] focus more on the devil.
[2:22:55] When you wake up, uh the devil, the
[2:22:57] devil, the devil, the devil, the devil,
[2:22:59] you become devil omniresent.
[2:23:06] You don't see God, God, God, God, God,
[2:23:08] God, God, God. You just see the devil,
[2:23:11] the devil, the devil, the devil.
[2:23:15] Amen. Amen.
[2:23:18] A woman dress wrong, the devil. A woman
[2:23:21] dress God. Father, thank you because you
[2:23:23] saved me.
[2:23:25] [Applause]
[2:23:27] And now everything is toward God.
[2:23:31] [Applause]
[2:23:32] I'm not a devil advertiser.
[2:23:38] [Applause]
[2:23:40] Do you know nowadays things are so bad?
[2:23:43] Everybody's bad. Homosexual. I don't
[2:23:45] have time for homosexual. Children of
[2:23:47] God are getting strong. The message
[2:23:50] become clear, planner, beautiful, yummy.
[2:23:54] Things are changing. My kids are moving.
[2:23:56] Their grade are coming up good.
[2:23:59] They begin to be filled with the Holy
[2:24:00] Spirit.
[2:24:02] There is a lot to talk about.
[2:24:04] [Applause]
[2:24:08] They hate to be ignored.
[2:24:15] Can I continue?
[2:24:16] Can I continue?
[2:24:19] Glory to God. He said, where are we at,
[2:24:21] my friend?
[2:24:22] Oh, glory.
[2:24:23] 21.
[2:24:24] He says verse 20. And if I do that which
[2:24:27] I would not, it is no more I
[2:24:30] that do it. But it's who?
[2:24:32] Sin
[2:24:33] that do it,
[2:24:34] brother enemy.
[2:24:38] Nothing to left good. Paul is saying
[2:24:41] that nothing dwelleth good is sin.
[2:24:46] And Paul say when I did something bad it
[2:24:48] is not me.
[2:24:52] It is sin
[2:24:55] h you the one that did it. Yes.
[2:24:58] But it's not me
[2:25:03] in me. I don't want to do sin.
[2:25:05] It is sin that is doing sin.
[2:25:11] Don't worry my friend.
[2:25:13] These are strong stuff.
[2:25:15] It's born to crack.
[2:25:17] Okay, we will go slowly my friend. Can
[2:25:20] we continue?
[2:25:21] Amen.
[2:25:22] Verse 21. And I found then a lot.
[2:25:25] Uhhuh.
[2:25:26] When I would do good,
[2:25:29] what is wrong?
[2:25:30] Evil is present with me.
[2:25:32] Evil is present in your flesh. That's
[2:25:34] right.
[2:25:36] Brother Brandham say that's why you want
[2:25:37] to wake up going to church.
[2:25:39] Evil is telling you you tired.
[2:25:44] Stay home.
[2:25:46] Stream.
[2:25:47] Stream.
[2:25:48] It's evil. Brother Brandham. Say it's
[2:25:50] evil telling you though.
[2:25:53] And as soon as you get to church, that
[2:25:55] sleepness is gone.
[2:25:58] So you are waiting for me to hit the
[2:25:59] door of the church
[2:26:00] because that sleepness want to keep you
[2:26:02] home. That's right.
[2:26:05] [Music]
[2:26:07] Are we together?
[2:26:08] And the because the devil and and if you
[2:26:11] stay home streaming after a while you
[2:26:13] will hear a condemnation
[2:26:15] like I should have gone to service.
[2:26:18] It's too late.
[2:26:20] It's too late now. You stay at home
[2:26:23] and next Wednesday he comes again with
[2:26:25] the same thing and you don't learn.
[2:26:28] You don't learn. You keep doing the same
[2:26:30] thing.
[2:26:32] He said, "Don't worry." Have you ever
[2:26:34] noticed how Wednesday are
[2:26:36] always a lot of stuff going only on
[2:26:38] Wednesday? On Tuesday, no problem.
[2:26:39] Because he knows there is no service.
[2:26:41] Wait on Wednesday.
[2:26:43] Wait on Sunday morning. You see,
[2:26:47] why is he trouble only on Wednesday on
[2:26:49] Sunday? He knows what is going on.
[2:26:52] He's using evil in you.
[2:26:59] [Laughter]
[2:27:01] You need to understand. That's why
[2:27:03] brother Brandham said the greatest
[2:27:05] battle ever fought started in us.
[2:27:11] Can we continue?
[2:27:12] Where are we at? He says, "I found a
[2:27:15] law." Verse 21, "When I'm good in time."
[2:27:19] Yeah. Let me try quickly. And then he
[2:27:22] say, I found a law that I would what?
[2:27:25] When I would do good, evil is present
[2:27:27] with me.
[2:27:28] For I delight.
[2:27:30] [Music]
[2:27:32] It's a pleasure.
[2:27:34] I delight in the law of what?
[2:27:37] God.
[2:27:38] After what?
[2:27:38] The inward man.
[2:27:39] When I take my heart, I I I enjoy God.
[2:27:44] I want to be like God. I love God's
[2:27:47] stuff.
[2:27:48] But therefore, you keep showing me like
[2:27:50] I'm no good.
[2:27:53] Amen.
[2:27:57] Why is the devil tormenting you like
[2:27:59] that?
[2:28:00] Because there is a power when you
[2:28:02] understand this thing.
[2:28:06] If not, a servant will walk on the horse
[2:28:10] and the prince will walk as a servant.
[2:28:14] Amen. He says
[2:28:17] verse 23.
[2:28:18] But I see another law where
[2:28:21] in my members
[2:28:22] doing what?
[2:28:23] Waring against the law of my mind.
[2:28:25] Brother Brham say that mind means heart.
[2:28:29] So there is a waring against the law of
[2:28:32] my mind and bringing me into what?
[2:28:34] Captivity
[2:28:35] to the law of what?
[2:28:36] Sin.
[2:28:37] Which is where?
[2:28:38] In my members.
[2:28:39] Oh wretched man. Amen.
[2:28:42] In other words, Paul, Paul is saying, I
[2:28:44] have a fight within myself.
[2:28:47] Miserable.
[2:28:49] Oh, wretched man. Amen.
[2:28:51] Amen.
[2:28:52] That I am. Who shall deliver me from the
[2:28:56] body
[2:28:57] of what?
[2:28:58] This death.
[2:28:59] Remember those people die like men?
[2:29:02] So Paul realized that in the flesh there
[2:29:05] is death.
[2:29:06] [Applause]
[2:29:08] And he found that that death is worrying
[2:29:11] constantly.
[2:29:13] When he want to do something good,
[2:29:14] something is blocking him.
[2:29:16] Paul said, "Wait a minute. Who who who
[2:29:18] can take this flesh away so I can be
[2:29:21] free 100% in a glorified body to go
[2:29:25] serve the Lord?"
[2:29:27] Amen.
[2:29:28] Are we together?
[2:29:29] Amen.
[2:29:29] Verse 25. I thank God.
[2:29:32] Hallelujah.
[2:29:36] through who?
[2:29:37] Jesus Christ.
[2:29:39] Lord,
[2:29:39] our Lord. So then with the
[2:29:42] mind
[2:29:43] I may serve what?
[2:29:44] Serve the law of God.
[2:29:46] But with the flesh the law of what?
[2:29:48] I thank God. Now I understand
[2:29:52] that inside of me
[2:29:54] I am a good man.
[2:29:58] Even though sometime I'm going to be
[2:30:00] caught up into stuff. This prepare you
[2:30:04] to Roman 8 verse1.
[2:30:08] Amen.
[2:30:10] [Laughter]
[2:30:14] Amen.
[2:30:16] Amen.
[2:30:18] When you understand this, the problem is
[2:30:21] over.
[2:30:23] Now if I trouble, it is not me.
[2:30:27] What do I do? Repent.
[2:30:30] Go see grandma. Go see grandma quickly.
[2:30:34] Tell grandma about the duck.
[2:30:39] Tell grandma about the duck quickly.
[2:30:43] Are we together?
[2:30:44] Are we together?
[2:30:46] Let's go to Luke verse now. Roman 8
[2:30:49] verse what?
[2:30:50] After you understand the mystery
[2:30:53] that in me I'm not bad.
[2:30:58] Say it to yourself.
[2:31:00] Say it to yourself. I'm not bad.
[2:31:02] I'm not bad.
[2:31:02] I'm a child of God.
[2:31:04] I'm a son of God.
[2:31:06] I'm a son of the king.
[2:31:08] I am God.
[2:31:09] There is nothing evil in me.
[2:31:13] If your heart condemns you not
[2:31:20] [Applause]
[2:31:22] brother John brother
[2:31:24] the Bible say if your heart
[2:31:27] condemn you not. Not if your body
[2:31:30] condemn you not.
[2:31:32] Not your body if your heart
[2:31:35] condemn you not.
[2:31:36] Not the body. Their heart
[2:31:38] condemn you not. Amen.
[2:31:46] [Applause]
[2:31:48] That's why Elijah was a man of like
[2:31:52] passion.
[2:31:53] Brother Brham say he has his
[2:32:00] greatest enemy with your own brother. It
[2:32:03] is not the inside with your brother.
[2:32:06] It is the sticky with your Mayan
[2:32:08] brother.
[2:32:09] But that didn't stop
[2:32:11] the inside to create squirrel.
[2:32:19] [Music]
[2:32:22] Are we together? Are we together? When
[2:32:24] you understand the battle, the fight
[2:32:27] that goes within you. Are we together
[2:32:29] now? Roman 8 verse1. Let's read it
[2:32:33] together. There is therefore in other
[2:32:36] words as a conclusion.
[2:32:39] Yes sir.
[2:32:39] As a conclusion there is therefore what?
[2:32:42] No
[2:32:44] no what?
[2:32:45] Condemnation
[2:32:46] to them which are what?
[2:32:47] In Christ Jesus
[2:32:48] who walk after the what?
[2:32:50] The flesh. Not after
[2:32:52] not after the flesh but after the what?
[2:32:54] The spirit.
[2:32:55] In other words, as long as I'm walking
[2:32:57] in the spirit, there is no condemnation.
[2:33:01] [Applause]
[2:33:15] Let me ask you something.
[2:33:18] If you got upset, brother Charles, you
[2:33:20] are very upset.
[2:33:22] And then if you turn around, you say,
[2:33:23] "I'm sorry."
[2:33:24] Have you cooled down?
[2:33:26] No.
[2:33:27] You have not cooled down yet. The devil
[2:33:29] would tell you you wait when you cool
[2:33:31] down.
[2:33:32] That's correct.
[2:33:32] Before you pray,
[2:33:36] but that's not what God say.
[2:33:39] When I turn around and I say, I am
[2:33:41] sorry.
[2:33:42] Whether my temperature is coming down,
[2:33:45] there is no more condemnation.
[2:33:49] Yes sir.
[2:33:52] Yes sir. Because
[2:33:56] many of you play ball,
[2:33:58] you know how we play basketball, how we
[2:34:00] do this.
[2:34:01] The hand is moving the ball,
[2:34:03] but if you take the hand off,
[2:34:05] the ball will continue to bounce,
[2:34:07] but the hand is not there.
[2:34:10] All it takes is a matter of time and
[2:34:12] that ball will bust, bust until it's
[2:34:15] flat and it stop.
[2:34:18] If you ask me, the ball is bursting.
[2:34:20] There is no hand there. But it's still
[2:34:23] bouncing. There is no hand there. But
[2:34:25] the ball is still moving. You keep
[2:34:27] looking at the ball. The hand is not
[2:34:29] there.
[2:34:30] There is therefore no condemnation.
[2:34:33] [Applause]
[2:34:38] I I have to break down like this so you
[2:34:41] see it clearly.
[2:34:45] [Applause]
[2:34:51] Stop.
[2:34:52] I'm going to close.
[2:34:55] In Romans 3,
[2:34:56] the Bible say, "All have sinned."
[2:35:01] Remember
[2:35:02] Romans 7, the battle?
[2:35:05] Romans 8, no condemnation. Why? What is
[2:35:09] God trying to do? Why is God preparing
[2:35:11] you to no condemnation?
[2:35:16] Are we together? Are we together? Are we
[2:35:19] together? Let's read then. I'm going to
[2:35:20] finish here. I'm going to stop here
[2:35:22] because time is gone. He says verse two,
[2:35:25] for the law of the spirit of life in
[2:35:27] who?
[2:35:28] In Christ Jesus
[2:35:29] had made me what?
[2:35:30] Free from the law of sin and death.
[2:35:33] For what? The law could not do
[2:35:35] in that he was what?
[2:35:37] Weak through the flesh.
[2:35:39] God sending who?
[2:35:41] His own son
[2:35:42] in the likeness of a perfect flesh.
[2:35:46] sinful flesh.
[2:35:49] Hallelujah.
[2:35:50] Even the son have to come
[2:35:53] in the likeness of a sinful flesh.
[2:35:58] We will get to that
[2:36:00] on the next the Lord's willing. Then
[2:36:02] you're going to see what where where he
[2:36:05] we heading. He said in the likeness of
[2:36:07] sinful flesh and for what?
[2:36:09] Sin
[2:36:10] condemn what?
[2:36:11] Sin in the flesh.
[2:36:13] He condemns sin where
[2:36:14] in the flesh.
[2:36:17] Job to verse 19, my friend.
[2:36:21] No, Job to verse uh nine. I'm sorry.
[2:36:25] You there?
[2:36:26] Amen.
[2:36:28] But you are not what?
[2:36:30] In the flesh.
[2:36:31] Ah, but the flesh is the one troubling
[2:36:33] you.
[2:36:34] I still see your flesh.
[2:36:35] That's right. That's right.
[2:36:37] But Paul say you are not in the flesh,
[2:36:39] but in the water.
[2:36:40] In the spirit. If so be that the water,
[2:36:43] the spirit of God dwell in you.
[2:36:45] Now if any man have not the spirit of
[2:36:48] God, he is not his what?
[2:36:50] None of his.
[2:36:51] We clear there.
[2:36:52] Uhhuh.
[2:36:53] Job to verse 34. Then I finished. Watch.
[2:36:56] Uh Job to verse uh
[2:36:59] uh
[2:37:04] job to verse 18. Amen.
[2:37:07] Amen.
[2:37:07] Verse 18. If you're there, you can say
[2:37:09] amen.
[2:37:10] Amen. Job go to 17. I'm going to close.
[2:37:13] He say if children then we are what
[2:37:19] all have sin
[2:37:21] cut short of the glory of God
[2:37:23] in you good in you in your flesh bad.
[2:37:27] I'm struggling. Who can deliver me?
[2:37:30] Thank be to God. There is therefore no
[2:37:32] condemnation. Why no condemnation?
[2:37:35] Because God is about to do something.
[2:37:38] That's right.
[2:37:39] I'm in Roman 8.
[2:37:40] What is he trying to do?
[2:37:42] He's reminding us now who we are.
[2:37:46] Watch in Roman 8.
[2:37:47] God have to clear that condemnation
[2:37:50] because if the condemnation is there, he
[2:37:52] cannot bring the remaining of Roman 8.
[2:37:57] I don't know if you're getting this.
[2:37:59] He says in in verse 17, if children,
[2:38:02] remember all of you are children of the
[2:38:04] most high.
[2:38:05] If children, then what? Hes
[2:38:08] hairs of who?
[2:38:09] Of God.
[2:38:10] And what?
[2:38:10] And joint hes with Christ.
[2:38:12] And if so, if so be that we suffer with
[2:38:15] him, that we may also be what?
[2:38:18] Glorified together.
[2:38:19] For I reckon that the suffering of what
[2:38:22] this present time
[2:38:23] are not worthy to be compared with what?
[2:38:26] With the glory,
[2:38:27] which shall be what?
[2:38:28] Revealed in us.
[2:38:29] For the earnest expectation of what?
[2:38:32] The creature.
[2:38:33] Wait for what? the manifestation of the
[2:38:36] sons of God.
[2:38:37] After the condemnation is removed, then
[2:38:41] the son of man can be manifested
[2:38:44] or revealed.
[2:38:47] [Applause]
[2:38:51] Are we together? Are we together?
[2:38:53] Are we together?
[2:38:55] Let's finish his this on verse 33. 34
[2:38:58] 33. If you dare, you can say amen.
[2:39:00] Amen.
[2:39:01] Watch this. is the same verse Romans 8
[2:39:04] verse 33 who shall what
[2:39:08] lay anything
[2:39:09] against what
[2:39:10] to the charge of God's elect
[2:39:12] it is who
[2:39:13] God
[2:39:14] that do what
[2:39:15] that justify
[2:39:16] why is God standing there to justify
[2:39:18] them
[2:39:21] because justification means you
[2:39:25] did it you did it here
[2:39:31] and the record shows
[2:39:33] that you did it here.
[2:39:36] The courthouse have it
[2:39:38] that you did it here.
[2:39:39] So justification means you did it here
[2:39:42] but you never done it there.
[2:39:46] [Applause]
[2:39:51] Are we together? Are we together? That's
[2:39:54] why God said who shall lay what?
[2:39:57] Any child.
[2:39:58] Who shall lay what?
[2:40:00] Anything. Who shall they? How many?
[2:40:02] Anything.
[2:40:03] How many?
[2:40:04] Anything.
[2:40:05] What does anything mean?
[2:40:07] Anything.
[2:40:08] Anything means anything.
[2:40:10] So who are they? Anything?
[2:40:14] [Music]
[2:40:16] Tell the devil you are bringing charges.
[2:40:20] They already say who shall lay anything?
[2:40:25] So if you already have something, you
[2:40:28] are wrong to begin with.
[2:40:31] God help me.
[2:40:32] He said, "Who shall lay anything to the
[2:40:34] what?"
[2:40:35] Charge of God's elect.
[2:40:37] Charge of God's what?
[2:40:39] Elect.
[2:40:40] Remember when we when we going to come
[2:40:42] back in in John 7, this is the one Jesus
[2:40:45] was praying for.
[2:40:47] Yes, sir.
[2:40:48] For God is the elect. It is God that do
[2:40:50] what?
[2:40:51] That justifyth.
[2:40:52] Who is he that does what?
[2:40:54] That condemnth.
[2:40:55] It is Christ that did what?
[2:40:56] That died
[2:40:57] and water.
[2:40:58] Yay. rather
[2:40:59] is what
[2:40:59] that is risen again.
[2:41:01] Who is even where?
[2:41:03] The right hand of God.
[2:41:05] Doing what?
[2:41:06] Who also maketh intercession.
[2:41:08] Why is he interceding?
[2:41:12] Amen. Amen.
[2:41:18] Amen.
[2:41:20] Let's stop here, my friend.
[2:41:23] Let's stop here, my friend.
[2:41:27] The inside man
[2:41:29] loves God
[2:41:31] want to do the work of God
[2:41:33] doesn't want to do what is wrong want to
[2:41:36] leave the message
[2:41:37] the inside God doesn't fight back with
[2:41:40] brother brother
[2:41:42] the inside God even though the inside
[2:41:45] man even though the outside don't want
[2:41:48] it the inside is saying Lord help me I
[2:41:51] want
[2:41:57] I agree with brother Brham
[2:42:01] but the outside man is having trouble
[2:42:05] and God say wait a minute don't look at
[2:42:08] the outside man remember there is
[2:42:10] somebody making intercession I already
[2:42:13] put a 24-hour service
[2:42:16] to handle your flesh
[2:42:19] [Applause]
[2:42:24] Let's stop here, my friend.
[2:42:26] We're going to pick up again and we're
[2:42:29] going to see these two stages in the
[2:42:30] life of Jesus Christ.
[2:42:32] Amen.
[2:42:33] Amen.
[2:42:35] Because Moses was blown when they told
[2:42:37] him under the blood under the blood of
[2:42:39] bulls and goat that he can be God.
[2:42:43] Amen.
[2:42:45] Amen.
[2:42:46] Amen. Amen.
[2:42:47] And it started with Moses,
[2:42:51] the one who killed somebody.
[2:42:55] And God say, "You're going to be God."
[2:42:58] A God murderer.
[2:43:01] Do you see what Moses have to fight?
[2:43:05] Amen.
[2:43:05] Do you see what Moses have to fight?
[2:43:09] Jesus.
[2:43:12] Amen. Even his own brother reminded him
[2:43:17] that do you want to kill me like you did
[2:43:18] the
[2:43:18] Egyptian?
[2:43:23] Amen.
[2:43:25] Either you take the leadership
[2:43:27] or you keep stuck right there.
[2:43:29] I'm not going to Egypt anymore.
[2:43:32] You making that intercessor waste his
[2:43:35] time
[2:43:37] because he's going to Roman 8 to break
[2:43:40] the condemnation and say you're wasting
[2:43:42] your time with this battle right here.
[2:43:44] There is therefore no more condemnation.
[2:43:47] Move on to the manifestation.
[2:43:50] And at the end, if you watch Romans 8,
[2:43:53] it talks about the body change.
[2:43:59] But to move from that all the way to the
[2:44:02] body change, condemnation have to be
[2:44:04] clear for you. You have to be mature
[2:44:06] enough to understand this thing to
[2:44:08] remove condemnation.
[2:44:10] Don't linger with grammar. Go talk to
[2:44:13] grandma.
[2:44:17] Don't linger with grandma.
[2:44:23] Are we clear?
[2:44:24] Let's stop here. Let's stand.
[2:44:29] Father help. I'm sorry I went 10 minutes
[2:44:31] over.
[2:44:34] Amen.
[2:44:35] Amen.
[2:44:36] Amen. Amen.
[2:44:41] Oh, glory to God.
[2:44:44] Amen.
[2:44:45] Amen.
[2:44:48] You would not manifest God
[2:44:52] when you are in glorified body.
[2:44:56] Keep that in mind.
[2:44:59] Okay.
[2:45:00] If you're waiting for the rapture, like
[2:45:01] some are waiting. Yeah, we all waiting
[2:45:03] for the rapture. But if you're waiting
[2:45:05] for the rapture and then after the
[2:45:06] rapture, that's when you're going to be
[2:45:08] speaking things.
[2:45:09] That's your problem.
[2:45:12] I will show you a quote where brother
[2:45:14] Brandham say you will regret.
[2:45:18] I will show you a quote. It's right
[2:45:19] here.
[2:45:20] Amen.
[2:45:21] But we got to deal with that thing.
[2:45:24] You understand the fall a little bit
[2:45:26] today. Next time God knew why we have to
[2:45:29] stop at the fall and the condemnation.
[2:45:31] Now you're going to see what is God want
[2:45:33] you to be.
[2:45:35] Amen.
[2:45:36] Amen.
[2:45:37] So now you can swallow it because if we
[2:45:39] don't deal with this, you won't swallow
[2:45:41] that.
[2:45:41] You will have a hard time swallowing it.
[2:45:43] That's correct.
[2:45:43] But I'm going to go scripture and quote
[2:45:45] and quote and quote and quote and you
[2:45:46] see it.
[2:45:47] Let's pray.
[2:45:49] Heavenly Father,
[2:45:50] Lord, we approaching you humbly this
[2:45:53] afternoon. Father, once again we thank
[2:45:56] you for your grace, for your love, for
[2:45:58] your mercy and Lord, Father, your rescue
[2:46:01] coming up to us. Father, delivering us
[2:46:04] from these daily battles,
[2:46:07] these daily confusion
[2:46:10] that the devil for years.
[2:46:13] We have been beaten down
[2:46:18] and it seems like we go 10 zero and go
[2:46:21] back 10 zero and go back 10 zero and
[2:46:24] it's weary to the spirit.
[2:46:27] But father, you are coming to show to us
[2:46:31] that when we reach 10, we are 10.
[2:46:35] We just need to talk to grandma right
[2:46:36] there
[2:46:37] and continue our journey.
[2:46:40] Lord
[2:46:43] Father, may you help this church.
[2:46:45] Lord,
[2:46:45] may you help your children worldwide.
[2:46:48] May you help us, Lord, to overcome these
[2:46:50] things because you waiting and nature
[2:46:53] itself is waiting
[2:46:55] for the manifestation of the sons of
[2:46:58] God. Yes.
[2:46:59] But the sons of God, has been beaten
[2:47:01] down,
[2:47:02] have been troubled in their flesh,
[2:47:04] have been unknowing, tormented
[2:47:06] constantly by the devil, not knowing how
[2:47:09] to fight this battle. And the enemy has
[2:47:12] intensified.
[2:47:13] Lord, they fight until it's almost
[2:47:17] impossible to see anyone dress immoral,
[2:47:21] I mean morally outside. Everywhere we
[2:47:24] going, women are dressed wrong.
[2:47:27] Everywhere we going, people are cursing.
[2:47:30] Everywhere we looking, it's sin, sin,
[2:47:32] sin, sin. All over sin.
[2:47:34] And it seems like it's trapped
[2:47:36] everywhere.
[2:47:37] How can you bring a bride
[2:47:40] without spot?
[2:47:41] Hallelujah.
[2:47:42] Hallelujah.
[2:47:44] In this time like this,
[2:47:47] in the midst of a certain Eden,
[2:47:49] how can you bring people that can keep
[2:47:52] their mind sound?
[2:47:54] Amen.
[2:47:54] Hallelujah.
[2:47:55] Amen. Yes.
[2:47:57] In the midst of societies
[2:47:59] that have lost their mind
[2:48:04] where clothing that were wore by mental
[2:48:09] illness people
[2:48:11] are now called fashion
[2:48:14] a pair of gin that is torn down.
[2:48:16] Yes Lord Jesus
[2:48:17] for mad people
[2:48:20] today it becomes something normal.
[2:48:22] Yes.
[2:48:23] What was evil is called good
[2:48:27] until our children are confused.
[2:48:30] They're trying to confuse the bathrooms.
[2:48:32] Amen.
[2:48:34] Father, how can we live
[2:48:36] in such a world?
[2:48:38] Thank you, Lord.
[2:48:40] Without being affected one way or the
[2:48:42] other
[2:48:43] by the devil. And every time we are
[2:48:45] affected,
[2:48:48] he ride on that
[2:48:49] to beat us down
[2:48:51] and show that you are not better than
[2:48:53] them.
[2:48:54] But father,
[2:48:55] praise God.
[2:48:56] Praise God.
[2:48:57] Praise God.
[2:48:57] You are unfolding this thing.
[2:49:00] So that we can stay up,
[2:49:02] keep our nose off the water
[2:49:04] and keep moving up
[2:49:06] knowing Lord Father
[2:49:08] that we are Christian.
[2:49:09] We are your children.
[2:49:11] We love you. Our heart is yearning for
[2:49:14] you
[2:49:16] and we are children of the most high.
[2:49:19] Father, touch those that are sick.
[2:49:22] Touch those that are afflicted.
[2:49:24] And whoever who came here with a
[2:49:26] problem, may you give them solution.
[2:49:28] And whoever who have not clear with
[2:49:30] grammar,
[2:49:32] may they go back and remove that thing
[2:49:35] that they have hidden
[2:49:36] that the devil has been using to beat
[2:49:39] them down. May they unfold it completely
[2:49:42] so that they can be free
[2:49:44] and receive the kiss of the son and be
[2:49:47] totally free indeed.
[2:49:49] Father, we commit Lord the remaining of
[2:49:51] the day and the oncoming week unto the
[2:49:53] hand. May your blood continue to protect
[2:49:56] us in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:49:59] Amen.
