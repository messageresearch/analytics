a special but before that this one was not written uh but I just wanted to remember it last week was Sister Andrea's birthday amen so we just want to say belated happy birthday to Sister Andrea amen amen amen um I don't have any um prayer requests but I believe we have unspoken prayer requests tonight amen amen I'm gonna call our brother Greg Your Man to um to just thank the Lord for our lives amen and for the resurrection amen amen and for the way that keeps coming to us and changing our model bodies and we know that one day we shall see him as he is a man we shall be changed amen amen uh you know we've been hearing that we don't know who we are and we're 60 years down the road from the opening of the seals um and the other day my wife and I went for a ride to uh and we stopped at an antique place and coming out of there I just something hit my throat and it was just it was strange it was just um it was just weird the way it did it and um I told myself I said Satan you have no power over me and I don't know what it was I don't know where it came from but I know where it went back to and I haven't had no problems with it so I thank the Lord so we don't know who we are it's it's time church that we realize Who We Are uh just like I was telling brother Kelly in the back there that slave that walked with his chest out and his head up he was the son of a king we're Sons and Daughters of the king and we need to act that way and expect things to happen let us pray father once again would just come before your father and Lord we're so thankful that you brought us here again Lord and Lord through the Mind battles that we go through during the week father and when Satan tries to drag us down but father we are Sons and Daughters of you and Satan has no authority over us you're the only one that has authority over us and Lord we're so far down the road father but Lord the things that you have been bringing to us father in this little assembly father and hearing the pastor say over and over again you don't know who you are but Lord we need to realize Who We Are and we need to stand up and say Who We Are and walk as Jesus walked unconscious of anything around him knowing who he was and knowing why he was here and nothing bothered him and Lord we need to believe that too father because we are your children father and Lord we need to rise up Lord as the song says there's an army rising up Lord we are that Army father we see the the destruction that is going on father just one after another Lord we know it's judgment and we see the perversion Lord that has taken place just on and on and we look at these things Lord and I seen the other day where they're they're calling for a Revival in California and Lord we know judgment is is uh the only thing Californians have before is judgment but Lord we see these things and we know where we're at because you have told us through your end time Prophet father to watch these things and father we see it transpiring very very fast and Lord as you told us through your prophet in the last hours of your life things manifested more in the last several hours than they did your entire life and Lord here we are at the end time seeing these things manifest just one after another and Lord we know that the body change can take place anytime and Lord we expect it Lord we're looking for and father we just Commit This service into your hands For Your Glory your honor Lord just let our hearts burn within us father as you speak to us along the way Lord let us look past the veil of Flesh and see you standing there Lord as the prophet looked out over the audience Lord and seen you moving across the audience Lord may you move across this audience Lord and then and and just sweep over us Lord as as I was thinking earlier the the little Whirlwind that you caused to come to brother Stephen and brother Robert before we even moved into this place and Lord made that Whirlwind come tonight Lord and just hover over us father and Lord we just Commit This service into your hands father bless the tithes the offerings that we never want to forget that multiplied at 104. and Lord just all the prayer requests the unspoken we all know that we all have things on our hearts the father family members friends relatives Lord whatever they may be father we just commit them all into your hands Lord not worrying about anything father when we just bring it to your feet We Lay it there and we leave it there just knowing Lord that you're going that you're in control of it all as Ruth laid her life at the feet of Boaz after all the work that she did when she laid her life down there it was over and Boaz took care of her from then on and Lord that's what we believe we just committed to your hands father in Jesus name we pray amen amen amen we invited to share with you man said Lord Lift Me Up amen pray for me I'm pressing on the upward way new hide some games [Music] every day still praying

unveiling of the seven silver in trouble but praise God the seven syllables unveil amen and we know what it is Glory Glory Hallelujah welcome everybody visible and invisible audience welcome to spoken word Tabernacle amen everybody feeling good feeling refresh I know you've been through toes and cares and all the things that happen into the day but praise God we made it to church amen glory to God now we clear about the New Jerusalem now you can exhort or preach somebody exhort meaning the sisters preach meaning the brothers everybody okay how about the power of the Resurrection now you see the power of the Resurrection oh my God the Holy Spirit gave me a clear scripture straight that shows that without the real Direction there is no New Birth beside the one I give from First Peter chapter one there is another one clear with that the resurrection of Jesus Christ no holy ghost coming upon the believer amen because Jesus even says that I need its experience for me to go but how is he going with which kind of body with the body that he has he needed to change the body so the resurrection is very important amen so you pray for me because you keep unfolding it keeps opening up what I had already was loaded now I had to add more loaded stuff amen so you pray for me remember this coming uh Saturday at four o'clock that would be music part two here four o'clock so you pray for me because I will be the one here and you'll be the one enjoying back there so I need prayer amen because we got Easter coming up so you pray for me so everything will be okay but I believe the big bulk of it we already got it on the first uh part one and part two Lord's willing will dig into something else amen amen somebody wrote a question and answer about marriage there is no name but uh it's an invasive one so if possible send me a text whoever wrote it maybe they hear or maybe they're not here so I know exactly what you're looking at because I need more detail and probably it's a question that I would rather answer somebody individually than uh publicly because it's going to open a lot of Canon because everybody's a situation is different from one person to another so if I give you your answer maybe your situation is not exactly what somebody else is going and if we apply that across the board then we're going to get in trouble amen so it's a question about marriage so try to send me a text and tell me who you are and then we can set up an appointment and we can sit and talk and see what's going on Amen there is another question that was given to me about the firstborn that's a very difficult one but uh it is hard also for me to open it to the public I have to talk to the person individually amen and it's some of the stuff that are hard for somebody to open up finally somebody broke and opened it open it just a little bit and God help me to catch it and then say hey this is what's going on and the person admitted so you pray for me I have to deal with those question individually it only happened to the firstborn mm-hmm only happened to the firstborn and usually we do that unconsciously we don't know what we were doing and we didn't even mean harm but they usually are the first one that get affected that's why it's always good to seek for the Holy Spirit and to get into marriage with the Holy Ghost so that the children will grow up without any headache amen by the time you stabilize everything somebody is already have registered a lot of stuff that we need now to start cleaning up amen but thank God we got the word we got the bomb in gilia amen I am not preaching tonight I am taking my uh week break but today it's not really a break because I will be translating Because by the polycarp we'll be preaching amen so you know brother polycarp love brother polycarp and the family have a special unique Ministry for himself amen so let's pull on the gift of the Lord and by God's grace we will be blessed tonight only believe I can get away from it oh please believe oh leave believe all things are possible [Music] oh [Music] oh oh we believe all things are possible only be Lord I believe Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I love you Hallelujah Lord [Music] I believe I believe [Music] possible [Music] Lord I believe do you believe tonight all things are possible to whom they believe we thank the musician God richly bless you know I greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we are happy and glad to be in the house of God I am happy what about you this is where we can hear our father speaking to us God richly bless you since you standing [Music] let's go straight to our scriptures second king chapter 7. verse 3. beginning verse 3. second king chapter seven are you there okay I believe I can start from the first verse that say the Lord tomorrow be sold for a shekel and two measures of barley for sheko in the gate of Samaria foreign you see and there were four leprous men at the entering in the gate and they said one to another why sit we hear until we die why situate here until we die why situi here until we die hallelujah amen is if we say we will enter into the city then the feminism City and we shall die there and if we sit still here we die also now therefore come and let us fall unto the host of the Syrian if they save us alive we shall leave if they kill us we shall but die and those that are following streaming don't say that I don't know foreign [Music] maybe we had so many excuses not to make a difference but God gave us Grace to be here and I also I'm grateful to the past to give me this opportunity so that we can bring the brothers may God greatly bless him and his house and everything that he's doing according foreign once again I greet you all you know a man that is leprous or leprosy on itself it's something that is built a camp for them so that they cannot be in fellowship with other people amen amen our Lord man messenger but those people they were sitting at the gate there was a moment of a crisis of famine in Samaria in Japan no food and the man of God Elijah spoke about the feminine okay and that he prophesied that we will have food a measure of barley for shekels but there was a land a lord on Whose hand the King was leaning and he said secretary what you are prophesying about yes I don't care even if God opened windows from heaven and Lord and the man of God look at him he said you're not gonna be partaker of it and that was the end of his part but since the famine was all over the country we had four lepers they made a decision to go into the camp of the Philistine amen of the syrians of the Syrian we must go up there basket because we are hungry not reconditionally our condition cannot be a hindrance to us to make it to the Philly to the Syrian cancer you see they say if we stay here we die if we go there if you continue with the rest of the scripture [Music] and when they arrived there as they were going God made the Syrian to hear a noise like a noise of a great horse like a noise of horses of a great host [Music] and the kings of the Egyptian to come upon us that was the testimony when they heard the noise and those four people that were walking were not healthy people there were people that were feeble family maybe you are civil tonight you think that because you feeble there is no Solutions these people never look at the State lost in immersion when they were walking their son in the premium nobody could even hear the noise of the footsteps the communities or pray in a decision but because of the decision God Almighty took over because every time they make a step I say God said that's enough that's all right and God took care of the rice said the fair air brewing and God made it here and not in the camp of the enemy first before we continue refuses my subject is I refuse to be a victim of circumstances amen amen celebrate those celebrities they never look at the conditions they look at the leprosy they say victims they say our sickness cannot be a hindrance to us to block us from moving in life to claim on the benefits of God to claims on the Promises they say we gotta make a step yeah and when they took that decision to go yes God help them they left the tent is they got there they ate them Elizabeth they took money he disappeared the law they took God [Music] they said there is a big difference do you want to act like them the same God that helped them is the same tonight the same God two thousand years ago the one who promised the baptism of the Holy ghosts the one who promised peace and everything Shalom his name is Jehovah Shalom do you know what shalom means when you have shalom shalom means shalom in your health shalom shalom in your life shalom in all your businesses the cross he never looked at his condition to be a murderer but he said Master listener democracy come back Remember Me Lord amen he never looked at the mess that he made in the past amen amen he refused to look at his circumstances he refused to be a victim of his circumstances were you a son of daughters of God tonight I don't know what you did in the past in your life but you continue to condemn yourself at the cross inside of him they were also a predestinated there was something in here that was telling him no matter what you have done I'm still a child [Applause] not after tomorrow but today me and you and me the cross he recognized that he was the son of God that he could claim his inheritance amen amen Elizabeth we're not going to be a victim of circumstances I'm going to read something that brother Branham is saying here [Music] in the message believe is that this I believe in 1950 1962. paragraphs paragraph 106 and I will probably cut them off amen amen [Applause] you will forget you will leave everything so he inquired if we could find some slave to buy [Music] I'm in paragraph 107. before I read this he says when he looked at the slaves they noticed one of the slaves that every time he was working he was whistling illness they didn't see him with his head bow down he always have a chest upcoming press and then he was walking like a priest but he was still a Slave took notice of him what about that one do you sell it they say no he's not for sale he said why is he the chief of the slave no satanistan no no he's just a slave just like all of him so what makes him act different than all of them listen to me carefully for a long time I inquire about that myself but one day I found the answer that's a party that offer in his homeless his father is and though he's an alien away from home he still knows that he is the king son early it is and conduct himself like one end is an African native could realize that his father is a king and over here a million in a Strange Land is he can still know that across the sea he's a king son conduct themselves when you are Sons and Daughters of God [Applause] as she said
