TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you go to your break those things that ponder over them we don't have time to break it down as it should be broke down but I want you to do it when you get to the motel or hotel or wherever you're staying or the home gather together and study over miss him by the way that he reveals himself for he is so great yet hides himself in Simplicity to make himself known to the least see don't try to get the great because he goes on the top of it but listen to the Simplicity of God and then you find God you know you're in the simple ways High polished worthy wisdom educated always misses him now I'm not here and I know they're School teachers two or three that I know I'm sitting in here and I'm not here to contradict school and education and try to support illiteratives I'm not here for that but what it is the people as soul much up on that until they're even in the seminaries and so forth they're missing the very thing that God has put before them that's why uh not against brother who are in denomination but I'm against system of denominations because it tries to magnify uh self and and and educate its ministers and thus such a place until if they don't have the proper schooling and education they're ousted and and they have to stand the psychiatrist past and so forth I've never think that it was God's will to test the minister by Psychiatry but the testing by the word God 's way of testing his man that he sent out to have the word preach the word now today we preach philosophy we preach Creed and denominationalism and so many things in leaving off the word because they say it can't be understood it can be understood he promised to do it now we're asking him to do it now we're going to take a few characters sure for a few minutes let's notice in the days of Noah knows they they God seen worldly wisdom so greatly punctuated and respected he sent a simple message by a simple person to show them his grace now we know that in the day of Noah they claim that a civilization for so mighty then until we have never reached that spot yet in our modern civilization and I believe that it will finally be reached because our lord said as it was in the days of Noah so will it be at the coming of the son of man and he gave some illustration and they built the Pyramid in the speaks of Egypt and they built gigantic things that we have no power today to build such with they had a bombing if they could embalm a body to make it look so natural until it still stays today we cannot we cannot make a mummy today we have the stuff to make it with they had colors that

any praise report amen but uh she's approaching it God bless you Saints I don't really like to come up in the front I don't like to talk but I just have to give God praise um today because um he really showed up um this morning we Andrew and I we had a I had her devotion and while we were doing that um my sister called me and she says you know um I just got a note I was on the phone with my friend um in in England and and um I just got to realize that I was on I was using the wrong Channel I came up with a 360 dollar bill our phone are together so that's really me just really me and I was like oh my gosh okay and so we were already in a prayerful mode and everything and I must confess that um you know the first thing you're like oh I just had them take something off my bill before from you know something I didn't do and they're not gonna say that you know this is the last thing we're going to do for you so um you know you're thinking what kind of story can I give them and I was like no I can't lie so let me or how you know we can put it real good so I said you know Andrew let's just pray and I said let me take to the Lord and we just sit at large just make somebody come on the phone that can help us with this and lo and behold a young lady came on her she was so bubbly and everything and um so she says you know we're glad you know we thank to have you with us for a while for a good time and so forth and so on and you know I told her exactly what happened and she said okay let me see what I can do and she did what she could do and she says okay I can put on a long distance on it and whatever and she did that so instead of the 360 dollars if it cost us 15 dollars and so we want to give thanks for that amen and amen amen come on and there's one more thing um um so I don't know if you guys know but I'm an international student and I'm here at UNCC you know doing school and everything um so it's running down to the end of the semester and we've been having

found out that like if I don't cover the tuition for the rest of the semester for this semester all my classes from next semester were going to be canceled by tonight so for me it was very you know like worrying because if they got canceled then there's no guarantee I would get back into those classes and it would mess up you know my progress going forward because I only have like a year and a half left so this morning I explained the situation to my aunt and we were doing devotion and everything and we prayed about it and literally maybe like five ten minutes after my mom called and she told me that she got the money to be able you know to clear up that bill so that my classes won't be canceled so I'm a crybaby so I was crying all day but I'm thankful for that amen amen amen lights

having a hard time believing that no no have you seen your picture of Heidi does he show your body you add this shows water if you see the head it means you see in water so if you see this head it means water is it complicated amen that's your identification amen that is the identification brother Branham said this is a Vindication that the message is true amen you need my identification it's right there if you don't see it look clearly you will see who's in there amen if you still knew I will show you this one amen glory to God what a wonderful God that we serve all your songs are pointing to Sunday's message amen so you're already on Sunday when we're in Wednesday amen you prayed for me things keep opening up in a wonderful way the airplane I was about to send something I just stopped and say no let me just keep it to myself amen maybe on Sunday we'll talk about it but it is wonderful wonderful the Rapture opened up again more amen and you will see what happened you've seen the seven Church ages they were hidden right there in Genesis scripture have layers the period of time that God took to make Eve to us is the period of time that God is taking through the second Adam to make the second Eve for the marriage of the Lamb that's why the marriage of the Lamb is always at the end not at the beginning amen oh my God the Bible became a new book amen so we trust everybody is on board I'm sorry sometimes it's hard to find a way to cut it because it gets so good amen remember this Saturday we got sister Destiny's baby shower so you know how we handle our staff in spoken word Tabernacle whether it's a wedding a wedding shower or something don't bring me an excuse in other words just show up everybody okay show up until brother doesn't have a place amen so they say everybody is invited so not only the sister the sisters and the brother and it's in our temporary private Fellowship Hall it's a code for the church it's where we usually get our question and answer amen that's where the baby shower is it's at 2 30 so make sure you're there to support our sister and I believe it's not just going to be baby shower we'll spend some time fellowshipping with one another it has been a while amen that we can sit and talk with people of like Precious Faith amen you continue to remember brother great he went through the surgery well his home uh sent a message to Sister Sandy and say don't let me don't let him be a baby make him be a big boy says the pastor say brother Stephen I know he would get me on that one but he's doing good he's at home amen when you get a chance just give him a call and check that's why you don't see him uh tonight probably I believe he's uh streaming by God's grace Amen brother send mile is out today with sister Teresa they out for the 48th wedding anniversary four and eight hey man four number of Deliverance eight is eternity already is something and then eight is eternity so you can play around with it the way you want amen but I believe somehow he could be streaming we thank God for everything that he's doing amen tonight he's brother Tim cross he has been coming back to my mind over and over and I I forgot it and then he came back again and says no way so something and then he told me also that I was coming to his mind also so God was working on both ways amen so he got a testimony this is the fifth he's with us here tonight and the baby but I let him take that luxury to tell you the testimony I don't want to take his thunder away amen so you know him we love him and just be patient with me we talk with the Deacon and Brother David and see how we can make available the three hour session we have on musicians so somebody can review and go through scripture and see what's going on Amen and then you will understand you can see the blessing of the Lord God has been blessing us and Sunday was special amen so brother Tim cross I told him he's at home he's not a visitor he's coming part of our sister's church so preach like home pull the ark home and let him have his freedom and liberty amen so let's sing only believe as he make his way up oh leave believe this [Music] is [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] bless you this evening amen you can be seated for just a moment if you'd like me I just want to say how thankful we are to be with you in the service again this evening and what brother Stephen said is true I don't know two or three weeks ago and he just started coming on my heart and I sometimes as if you evangelize you think you know I'd like to call this brother but I don't want him to think I'm trying to invite myself you know so I just held off but some kept telling me you're fixing to hear from Brother Stephen you're about to hear so he contacted me on Monday and I said I've been waiting for your call and so uh you know the Lord is wonderful and so yes as he was saying I think the last time I was here my wife wasn't able to come with me but we'd given you an update we were waiting on everything to be finalized with the adoption of our little baby girl so sometime a number of months ago the the county they had been making routine visits and doing things it's all a process and they said all right it's all good to go but they said it's it's a 90-day wait from here till the time you can get the papers and everything will be done legally and so it was our desire for it to to um to finish or to be complete before her birthday which fell um the day after Thanksgiving so we asked the social worker we said is there any way you could ask them to expedite it or just move it up only a couple days and get it uh finalized before she turns to on the Friday after Thanksgiving because the courts are closed on Thursday and Friday Thanksgiving Day and the Friday after and this is all it's a court proceeding so she said well we can ask for it but that's that's about all we can do you know so um they told us they said call on you know call the attorneys uh that were handling it and get updates from them so Monday before Thanksgiving I I called up to the attorney's office and I said I'd like to get an update on this um do you think it'll happen you know by Wednesday because I knew the courts were closed Thursday and Friday and the lady that answered the phone was real nice and real sweet and she said well sir I just I just really don't know she couldn't give me any anything definitive so I was trying to just in a in a kind way just press or a little bit I said well if we don't know something by tomorrow it's very unlikely this would happen Wednesday and I said you know how how will we know or how do you find out and she said well sir I'm the person that goes by the courthouse every morning before I come here to the attorney's office and she said I went by this morning there was nothing so she said if I don't hear something and there's nothing tomorrow morning she said you know it's it's probably not very likely but she said I really don't know so about two hours went by and around one or two I guess Monday afternoon my wife called me she said I just got a call from the attorney she said the clerk of court took this entire week off but she got this finalized before she left on Friday and the email came through from the time I called that attorney's office until she called my wife they got the email she said the paperwork will be at the courthouse tomorrow you can go pick it up we got our papers in hand and uh all my wife's family all 200 of them come in it felt like it was a it was a great multitude trust me we we got to host Thanksgiving this year in our new home and so they were all trickling in through the week and we had Thanksgiving on Thursday we uh had the baby's birthday party on Saturday had the dedication on Sunday it's all official we've got the paperwork to God be the glory amen amen we thank God for it I know so many of you have prayed with us have believed with us and I could take a long time telling you how for the last 22 years since we've been married we've always believed God would make us parrots and there's been dreams there's been prophecies there have been all kinds of things along the way to boost our faith and uh you've been a great part of that in the prayers and I just thank the Lord we're all one one big family as God's family and so um we thank God for that amen so it's it's it's affecting my ministering it's affecting being places on time it's affected my wife's ability to sing but it's wonderful amen you know I like Divine interruptions and I believe this was a Divine interruption in our lives so a welcome change so amen if you'd like to stand with me this evening um just it really is an honor to be here I don't say that just to be said it I feel right at home when I'm here and there's always a great pull in the word and so that's wonderful I'm going to invite you to turn in your Bibles to Saint Luke chapter 4 and I was telling brother Stephen when I came in tonight I said you know it's it's outstanding to me uh the order from the moment I walk through the door everybody knows their place their position their responsibility their duties and and they just carried it out seamlessly and I said that's wonderful to see and so you know God is a god of order and he has set the church in an order amen and when it's followed then God the holy spirit is pleased amen and so we thank the Lord for that amen and I know praise the Lord amen I I know that doesn't just happen that's not uh organized chaos or coincidence the devil tries everything to disrupt that amen but when God's spirit prevails wonderful and you know we're all just falling right into place amen so we thank the Lord for that and we'll read tonight in Saint Luke chapter 4 and just before we We Begin here we'll go and approach the author of the word in prayer ask the Lord to come and Quicken these words and just have his way in our midst this evening Heavenly Father Lord we are so Overjoyed in our hearts Lord these Lord momentary Lord these victories these triumphs and I say momentary but lord they're really Eternal therefore ordained before the foundation of the world and God how thankful we are to be walking into Lord your vision your promise lord it's not even our dreams or our hopes or our Ambitions but God is realizing your purpose for our lives and as we see that unfold Lord it it lifts our spirit Lord it it gives us the strength Lord to to rise and move forward and Lord As We Gather this evening we know that Lord I always say this it seems like but it's true Lord you said we're two or three would Gather in your name that you would be in the midst and Lord we believe you are present in this service this evening Lord where your children have gathered Lord we didn't just come Lord to receive but we come to give you thanks give you praise Lord to give you the the honor and the glory that you do and we do ask you Lord to come among us this evening Lord and manifest your desires and your will for this service God touch every heart and every life God and break the bread of life to our hearts this evening Lord move Among Us and may your spirit may your presence may your power father God lord Drive unbelief from us Lord Drive fear away father God lord remove every hindrance God that the enemy would try to place in the way and we're claiming the victory Lord in this service tonight for your honor and Glory now just come Lord and and take this word Lord and take what I prepared Lord and Lord may you be glorified in all that's said and done we ask it in Jesus name we pray amen amen Saint Luke chapter 4 beginning at verse number 16. and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he had sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliberates to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him may the Lord bless the reading of his word as you're seated this evening you know I I believe this scripture has an even greater meaning to us today because of the light that has been shed on this through the ministering of God's prophet and so it it you know just it seemed like maybe a week or so ago the Holy Spirit was just impressing upon my heart to go and listen to the the series of messages that were preached in 1965 there on the month of February even the Sunday before the the meetings moved over into the Parkview High School there was a series of messages preached there in that high school and at the end is is marriage and divorce but that whole week um I suppose those those those uh days had been set aside the building there was reserved and so uh as I was moving through those series of sermons that God's Prophet preached I Came Upon this message and just listening to it and oh my it it makes the Bible live amen it brings what what was history or what's written here within these pages and it brings it very current amen and so you know you realize in the prophet of God begins there in that in that uh uh series there and he says you know this is right on the grounds where I went out late one night to pray as a boy burdened for my lost father and there he saw the the the the Lord Jesus appeared before him and his garments blowing in the wind and he said then right on this very spot here again he comes to preach and y'all may not know this but uh the the pastor who was the pastor before uh brother Josh Bennett who now pastors Apostolic Tabernacle that Pastor was Reverend Charles Brumley and brother Brumley was present for this series of meetings that brother Brandon preached there in Jeffersonville at the Parkview high school and he was there when brother Branham preached this day is this scripture fulfilled he was there with a relative of his brother a Nardi and so he he said he was sitting there I believe in in like the bleachers it was like a High School auditorium and he said he was sitting there and he said brother Adam would would rare his arm back and come back and say this day is this scripture fulfilled he said the the Holy Spirit would just sweep over the audience he said it was such a powerful thing to be a part of and he said he He Turned and made a comment to his uh I believe it was his cousin there brother brother Nardi he said if that man does that one more time this whole place is going to come apart or something like that and he said as soon as he made that comment that Prophet stared straight at him he said brother random stopped and just fixed his eyes right on him and he said the whole row of pews that whole roll of row of seats just began to tremble just begin to vibrate and shudder it was real friend the power of God is really men and so that experience he just he was transfixed by it and so you know when I hear those messages it's so real to me amen and I realize that's my prophet I mean that's that's that's God's Messenger to me in this hour amen and I accept it as thus saith the Lord amen it's a truth amen and so he he's bringing in that message and he's talking about how I guess only a few months earlier out in I believe it was in Phoenix he preached the message birth pains and their sister midi had given him a new Bible and the pages were stuck together and so he couldn't find the place in the scripture that he was looking for and he was getting kind of you know upset or flustered about it and he said here comes a priest and he says Be steady my son God is doing something a Catholic priest and so he hands brother Adam his Bible and the place where the battle is looking for so brother Adam then reads the text of it and goes on and preaches his message but then at the end of it that priest comes back and has another conversation and says you know we've we've either either the church has got to get out of the mess it's in or we've got to get out of the church he said brother Madam how come these preachers can't see this how come they can't see what you're preaching what the holy spirit is revealing and so before it was the priest telling brother Bradham Be steady my son Be steady my son God's fix God's doing something now brother random is calming the priests saying be still be still God is about to do something and then I believe it was a relative spoken and unknown tongue and interpreted amen and and verified or Vindicated the very conversation that was taking place there between brother Adam and that priest and so then brother random in hindsight realizes I believe he said afterwards they were going to grab something to eat with her family and sister meet he begins to say oh bill I was so nervous when you couldn't find your place in the scripture there and knowing I had given you that Bible and and how upsetting it was for her but then he said he heard the the the the the the the the angel of the lord of the spirit of the Lord spoke to him in an audible voice and quoted this very scripture recited this very scripture to him showing him that it was a repeat of exactly what had taken place in Luke chapter 4 had repeated itself right there in Phoenix Arizona and he unknowingly and a priest unknowingly had had reenacted this scene from the scripture and he goes on to say it's the same Messiah it's the same Jesus Christ amen revealing himself here now not in the first Advent but in his second coming the Jubilee trumpet is sounding again Amen to call a bride out of laodicea to call the believer out of denominational bondage amen and to set us in the Rapture order the coming of the Lord amen hallelujah some of you are rejoicing even now amen why because it is the Jubilee trumpet to the Bride of Jesus Christ amen and that's what I want to preach on tonight is recognizing your Jubilee trumpet because we realize and and I I'll tell you this it takes a prophet of God it takes a gift of God to extract this from the scriptures because I read here in a in a Scofield King James Version Bible amen uh Saint Luke 4 verses 16 through 19 and I don't see anything here referencing a jubilee trumpet but brother Bradham clearly says the acceptable year of the Lord refers to the Jubilee so that Jubilee was a law that was enacted in Israel for Israelites it was a it was something that was placed there when they reached the promised land this law was put there amen for their benefit so it was exclusive to Israelites it was exclusive to God's people and The Inheritance that God had given them in the Earth that if they were to be sown into slavery or taken into bondage or separated from their land and from their god-given rights and property amen that that would not be permanent but it was only for an uh predefined period of time at the end of which a jubilee trumpet would sound a man which was a signal for them to be restored back to what was theirs in the first place so this would show you that the Jubilee trumpet could sound but it would only have a special significance to a certain class of people [Applause] amen it had no meaning to a stranger it had no meaning to a Philistine it had no meaning to a hittite or an Amorite it had a meaning to an Israelites because it was God's law given to his people even to be able to regain what he had given them [Applause] [Music] so although the trumpet could be sounded it would only cause a certain reaction in a certain class of people who were listening for the trumpet and understood what to do when the trumpet sounded amen the acceptable year as we all know as Bible readers was the Year of Jubilee that when all slaves and prisoners as they were had been taken prison and had to give a son to pay a debt or a daughter to pay a debt and they were in bondage no matter how long they had been in bondage or how long they were supposed to stay there when the year come of the Jubilee when the Jubilee trumpet sounded every man could go free if he wanted to go free [Applause] you was no more a Slave amen so it showed amen before another person or another entity took ownership of you you was under another headship before you were sown into slavery before you gave away a child before you gave away something that was yours you were already under another law you were already under another protection that man only thought he owned you [Applause] that man only thought he was your master and it and brother Brown said it did not even matter what your Arrangement was the law of the Jubilee trumped or overrode amen it held a higher priority than whatever Arrangement you had made with the slave owner what a perfect example it is of the Gospel of Jesus Christ when it is preached the acceptable time at the time of Jubilee anybody no matter who you are what color you are what denomination you belong to how far you stooped in sin or what's wrong with you you can go free when you hear the gospel trumpet sound out you are free [Music] oh my I'm going to be sweating if I'm not careful Jesus was here entering the temple and the priest brought him the scroll the same scroll that every priest read every teacher read every religious scholar every Pharisee every sadducee amen it didn't every the Sanhedrin they all had the same letter they all had the same text but here is Jesus amen and the priest hands him the book and Jesus opened the book and he went to a specific place that pertained directly to him amen what this shows you is that the priest could give him the text but it took an anointed vessel it took the word made flesh to give the text the proper context because anybody can read the letters anybody with an education can read off the pages anybody can argue it anybody can debate it anybody can make a Creed out of it can make a Dogma out of it can make a law out of it but there's only one person that can make it live and that's the Holy Spirit [Music] God himself makes the word live and when he makes the word live it's not a differentiation it's not a contrast it's it's not a denial or a conflict [Music] but it's like a 3D image that comes out it makes the word three-dimensional if you will it takes it from what the carnal mind can comprehend and translates it into what God himself alone can live now that's the difference between a spiritual Spirit field born again Christian amen and a carnal or intellectual believer because to them it's just text it's just words on the page it's just doctrines it's just rules it's just oh you know a brother shimbo said or brother Timbo uh timbo brother shimbo said her brother Tim said or brother Branham said and it's just that man's word versus this man's word this man's idea versus this man's idea that's all it ever is to you you're missing the point but when the Holy Spirit comes in and quickens it not only to you but in you it brings it all together and it weaves you into that pattern so you are becoming the literal fulfillment of that word Hallelujah so when Jesus was reading the scriptures to him brother Kelly he wasn't just reading it like a newspaper Hallelujah he wasn't just reading in his history he wasn't reading it as a prophet's opinion he said the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor Hallelujah you know what I believe there was somebody sitting in the temple that day let's say wow wow wow I've heard this script around all my life but this is different this has power this is moving me this man is not just a teacher he's not just a lawyer he's not just arguing the word the word is living he caught their attention he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor somebody said that's me that's me I couldn't buy my way here I couldn't buy my citizenship I don't have a nickel to spare I don't have anything but I fit that description he was sent to me [Applause] he had sent me to heal the Brokenhearted you know what some little poor broken-hearted sister amen Hallelujah that's me I could follow a Ministry like this [Music] Hallelujah Jesus was beginning his ministry it's the first recorded event after he comes down from the Temptation in the wilderness is to enter the temple and take the word of God and make it a lie ah he's calling to gather the elect and he's using the preaching of the word the same word brother they had had for 2 000 years he was making that word live right there in the temple Hallelujah [Applause] preach the gospel to the poor send me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to Senate Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord I'm sure that was a mixed multitude in that Temple that day was a mixed multitude as as is the case most any time you have a gathering of people of any sight [Music] I'm sure everybody under the sound of his voice could not fall into these categories that he just missed it there was a maybe a wealthy person there who was very dignified and self-righteous and could buy off the priest could pay for whatever sacrifice they needed in other words they didn't need a messiah they didn't need a savior they didn't need Redemption they were not poor they were not brokenhearted they did they were not a captive in any way so they said who's this man talking to who who does this who does this Nazarite think he is coming into this entrance of the temple taking this place up here doesn't he know we have trained Scholars doesn't he know we have a hierarchy of priests with a blood lineage to prove they come from the aaronic priesthood who and they sit there in his mind in their minds they're resenting everything they're hearing why it wasn't to them it wasn't for them and they were not going to respond to the sounding of the Jubilee trumpet even though it was their opportunity to be freed it would not have that impact [Music] amen here is the Fulfillment the Fulfillment of those scriptures in their midst declaring himself and only a portion of them catching it the Jubilee was sounding but it doesn't have the same effect on everyone it only applies to a certain class of people here you'll hear and I quote this often I've probably quoted it here for the rest of the Book of Revelation is not meant for everybody it's for a specific it's a prophetic book and it's for prophetic class of people and I I say this you know a lot of people within the the Pentecostal denomination the charismatics even the religious World Protestant churches recognize that William Branham was a prophet but they classified him with every prophet anybody who had a gift to prophesy that's the category they put William Branham in men prophets women prophets anybody with the gift of Prophecy oh yes William Bradham was a prophet but that's not it takes a higher realization [Music] [Applause] he wasn't just a prophet he was a major prophet a scriptural Prophet a Capstone prophet coming at the end of the dispensations to book in what the first Apostle and Prophet The Apostle Paul began God sends another prophetic Ministry at the end of the Gentile dispensation to validate what the first prophet said amen and to cap it off and to prepare a bride to make her ready for the coming Christ the Messiah amen [Music] brother there's a lot of people that will even acknowledge the ministering of William Branham is the revealing of the son of man well you can read the messages and see that of us eighth grade education will tell you you could take it right out of the message and see that this ministry is a Ministry of the son of man but I'm not necessarily talking about people who can look at a prophetic Ministry and realize that's a prophetic Ministry I'm talking about a Ministry that can come under that same anointing a prophetic class of people that doesn't just bottle it all up in William Bradham But realize just like Elisha [Applause] that they could ask for even a double portion and for the same anointing to call upon the feminine designation of Elijah and the same Miracles continue on in a many membered body that's a prophetic class of people they're not just reading prophecy listening to prophecy they don't just appreciate prophecy they are carrying out they are the ongoing prophecy they are the perpetuation of what began in Malachi 4 hallelujah hallelujah they are the Revelation 10 8. that 10-7 made possible Hallelujah Hallelujah yes sir they don't just see the vision they are catching the vision and they are going on into the furtherance of the vision amen Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah praise God praise God Hallelujah aren't you thankful that you recognize it why don't you thank God there was something dead on the inside of you that could say Amen amen it wasn't for the world it was for me it wasn't for the county it was for me it wasn't for the church it wasn't for the pastor it was for me I heard my Jubilee trouble Hallelujah Hallelujah brother when you hear it when you hear it and you're an Israelite and you know that's my signal that's myself that's my priest that's the call of my return to everything that I fell from or everything that was taken from me you cannot be still you cannot be silent you cannot remain immobile but it's going to put you into action you are the response your salvation is the response is the echo the echo of the Jubilee trumpet your Justified life it's the echo of the trumpet you're a Sanctified life is the echo of the trumpet your healing your deliverance your Victory the release of all those chains of bondage it's the effect of that trumpet Hallelujah Hallelujah thank you Jesus [Applause] amen and if you can't silence the trumpet you sure aren't going to silence the reaction you sure are not going to silence the echo [Applause] because there's one sounding and many resoundings [Music] many echoes many reverberations many responses amen and I know you sit under a wonderful Bible teacher here but turn with me to Second Kings chapter eight let's see if we can mine something out of the scriptures here Hallelujah that's why I'm so thankful we've heard a trumpet that to the elect is a certain sound it's not an uncertain sound it's only confusion to those who are non predestinated they hear it's all just another voice just another opinion just another whack job but to the train deer to the elected oh no that's a distinct sound that's a scriptural sound that makes all the scriptures come together in a Perfect Blend in harmony hallelujah it's not an uncertain sound not as thinking about this may not be a good illustration but I was thinking about you know if you've ever had a dog the ears of most dogs hear frequencies that the human ear doesn't really even hear and so you watch a dog and if he's lived with a household or a master for a while he'll learn all he'll learn how to discern all of these sounds like he'll hear a car drive in the driveway or he'll hear food going in his bowl you won't hear that because your ear isn't tuned to that but his ear is tuned to it because he has the ability to pick up those sound vibrations and to him it has a special meaning it can be 50 or 100 feet away but the owner will come home and he'll grab an old bag of dog food and shake it over into the bowl or the painter you know and you won't hear that sound but all of a sudden that dog will go tilt his head no matter what you're doing all of a sudden he's distracted he heard something that has a unique meaning to him you might be playing with him you might be training them you might be trying to give them a bath you might be trying to get him to teach him something and all of a sudden you start salivating what are you salivating for I heard a sound [Applause] that's my sound that means it's time for me to get fed oh it doesn't mean anything it don't mean that to the neighbor's dog it don't mean that to the dog down the street but to this dog that sound has a special meaning for him it's time for me to get fed are you catching what I'm saying friend this sound the message of the hour does it cause that reaction among Every Creature but to those to whom it was set that sounds like the marriage supper call that sounds like time to get dressed to put on the wedding garment to lay aside the weight and the sin that does so easily be set us to lay aside the distraction to turn off amen the internet and the television and the worldly music and the gossip and the negativity it's time to turn all that off because I hear another sound it's going home time for the bride Hallelujah Hallelujah [Applause] same sound can have a dual effect remember the story of man listen to a servant two men sat side by side and heard a sermon one man got outside and said oh my wasn't that wonderful called me an eagle I heard the same message but he called me a crow the same sound because they're very different hearing thank God second Kings chapter eight then spake Elisha unto the woman whose son he had restored the life saying arise and go thou to thine household and sojourn wheresoever thou can so dirty for the Lord hath called for a famine and it shall also come upon the land seven years and the woman arose and did after the saying of the man of God and she went with her household and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years I'm gonna let you pick this up later and it came to pass at the seven years in that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land and the King talked with gehaza the servant of the man of God saying tell me I pray thee all the great things that Elisha have done now that was the same Elijah anointing and Commission Now expressing itself through what I would call a feminine designation same Commission same anointing but now expressing itself in a feminine designation Amen to be the vindication of Elijah what he came to make possible was now being lived and expressed to fold to a fold Twice The Miracles under the same anointing and commission as a compliment as a compliment to Elijah as a compliment to Malachi 4 as a compliment to Revelation 10 7. the bride's Ministry is the complement to Hallelujah we hold our sin unto you Elijah the prophet you are the benefactors hallelujah hallelujah the Capstone has been pulled off look on this and then the prophet brings the revelation of it to put you into action to put you in the motion [Applause] the windows of Heaven are open we prayed for it here it is [Applause] it came to pass as he was telling the king how that He restored a dead body to life that behold the woman whose son he had restored to life cried to the king for her house and for her land and gehaza said my Lord O King this is the woman and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life and when the king asked the woman she told him so the king appointed unto her a certain officer saying restore a Double L awe that was hurts [Applause] but but wait a minute she went away of her own choosing and on the advice of this prophet she left the land of promise to go down and sojourn with Philistines because of a famine he called yes his word to her gave her a protection against the very judgments of God that was falling upon that unbelieving King in his country so although it may have looked like she was forsaking or forfeiting she was not she was under Divine guidance through the instruction of a prophet [Music] doesn't matter that she doesn't matter that she wondered that she's straight that's immaterial the king I'm pointing unto her a certain officer saying restore all that was hers and not only the property not only not only being re-established not only reinheriting what had been hers all along not just giving her back what also no doubt had been desolate through the fat she wasn't there to farm it she wasn't there to irrigate it she wasn't there to fend off the the Predators she didn't do one thing but obey the prophet's instruction [Applause] Jubilee trumpet amen King appointed unto her a certain officer saying restore all that was hers and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land even until now so you know what that officer and brother Stephen I'm just going to say that represents the Holy Spirit because he's God's enforcement agency he's God's Enforcer he is there to enforce the will of God to every Son of God every daughter of God that's under the Divine promise of God he is there to ensure that God's desires are realized to that son or daughter of God and everything that she identifies as hurts [Applause] are you with me so she's going back through this territory say that's mine that's mine that's mine that's mine he says give it to her give it to her give it to her but no butts but wait a minute she said she fell she made a mistake no butts no opposition no contrary opinion whatever she identifies was ever hers the King has issued a decree and I am here to enforce and I have the full backing the full power all of the Power of his kingdom is behind her word whatever she says is hers give it to her whatsoever things you shall ask in my name [Applause] whatever is yours tonight brother and sister that's your Jubilee trumpet oh but I wonder if she would have been like some people today you know what I'll be satisfied with one service a week with a little shiver down my spine every now and then you know huh if it was ever yours why don't you take it back why do you satisfy or why do you settle for something less and God's promises full healing full Deliverance full salvation for your family for your spouse full Victory full Joy full peace in the Holy Spirit ah my God I'll Supply a Double L all of your needs according to his riches in glory do you see the Promise in the word of God stand on it Satan you're gonna have to move this is mine this is my salvation is mine joyous smile peace is my my family is mine Hallelujah I'm not satisfied with anything less [Applause] all the joy all the gifts of the Spirit in the operation in the local assembly every Ministry every Talent every gift of full compliment Hallelujah [Applause] I like the song says I'm gonna take back everything that the devil stole from me [Applause] amen I say this about the children of Israel they weren't driving Canaanites off at Canaanites land they were driving Canaanites off of their land that God had given them 400 years ago they weren't taking anything they were taking it back they were repossessing what had been theirs the entire time amen you're not taking the devil's property from him you're taking yours back God's got the Holy Spirit right there but you gotta have enough faith you gotta be in the word of God enough and to recognize the devil in his tactics and say Satan you're just a bluff you're trying to Bluff me off my territory and I'm not standing for it this is mine I'm taking it back I'm serving notice on you in the name of the Lord get off of it I'm reclaiming it and it's not going to be as good as before it's gonna be better better than before Hallelujah Hallelujah all the rewards all the rewards Hallelujah under the Elisha expression of the Elijah Commission the widow woman didn't just receive her dead son revived back to life but she called for the restoration of all that had been missed during the seven years of famine and he appointed an officer he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit said to the church you know brother man said that if you refused the Jubilee trumpet and you opted you opted to be a Slave rather than to return to your original identity you were taken to the temple and by the priest you were bored in the ear bored through with an awl that's a symbol of slavery keep the earrings out of your ears used to just have to say for sisters but for brothers too Stephen I'm gonna take a little liberty here boys take your necklaces off take your bracelets off take your toe rings off take all this nonsense off amen that's a symbol of bondage and heathenism wear a wedding band if you're married otherwise get all the Hollywood Jewelry off of you you are sons of God you ought to look like sons of God and not sons of Hollywood study the roots of it you may not like it but study the roots of it it's Hedonism it's paganism it's idolatry and it comes out of the pits of hell we've got a prophet who showed us a proper order he said sisters it's all right to wear a necklace your husband gave you it's all right to wear a wedding man he told us what was in order I don't want anybody thinking I'm the devil's slave I wanted I want it to be known the truth [Applause] it'll give you freedom if you'll hear the trumpet but in other words this board here now they could hear the Jubilee trumpet sound however many times it would sound thereafter but it lost its meaning it lost its significance because in the and the prophet of God defines it in this message he describes it if you listen to me said they've allowed someone else to interpret the word to them that's why they missed it in Luke 4. that's why they missed it in 1965. and that's why they're missing it today they're letting a Ministry they're letting a priest they're letting something interpret that word to them to strip away the significance of what it should mean to a true son and daughter of God so they continue hearing the word but now they're hearing it with an intellectual understanding with with reasoning they're hearing it through the filter of a man or a Ministry or a church or a system and it's bondage and it's death but thank God it wasn't the same man amen I've probably used this here and I'm closing but uh most of you know I I'm a musician and and I love to play music I'm not even a good singer but I love music and singing and then they there's something in the the music world that they call sympathetic resonance I don't know if y'all have heard about this but it's it's it goes like this they use a they use tuning Forks to do it and and let's just say you have a a tuning fork that's tuned to the note of C ough all right you you strike that tuning fork and if there's another tuning fork within the sound of it just wherever those sound waves can travel and it also is tuned to that same note without having to be struck without any physical contact just the sounding of the one will resonate over to the other one that is tuned to the same note and it too will begin to sound [Music] why because it's answering to what it's been tuned to with no motion with no physical interaction with no Force present no visible Force present amen why it's answering to a similar note [Music] and it doesn't have to be a tuning fork it can be a guitar string it can be a piano string it can be anything a singer can hit the note and those strings will begin to answer why because they're tuned to match it he that hath an ear he that hath An Origin in the Homeland Hallelujah he that has a receiver down on the inside that can pick up the signal from the transmitter and say Amen oh Hallelujah Hallelujah let me just give you one illustration as we close tonight and there I was in the woods and the Holy Spirit spoke to me and said what are you doing here and I said hunting squirrels and said how many would you like and I said was it five five would make a mess three however many the number was and he asked me where I wanted them and brother Adam's telling this story at the table and it's a table full of Deacons preachers religious man they're sitting there listening the story and they're in their minds oh my I think even brother zabel told his Abel praise said Lord if what our brother has prayed if our what our brother has said is the truth Lord help him to find that other squirrel in other words he needed some physical he needed some tangible evidence to tie his faith to but there was a widow woman with a woman with an earshot with an Elisha anointing that when she heard the report she was tuned to that voice to that report and she said that's nothing but the truth she echoed [Applause] what was vibrating from the lips of a prophet and the Holy Spirit echoed from heaven [Applause] give her give her whatsoever she asked for whatsoever she desires give it to her in the name of the Lord Jubilee Trump Jubilee trap salvation to her two sons she recognized her to believe and her children were saved Hallelujah she might have died of purple she might have lived in a poor home she might have not had enough money to hardly put something in the offering plate but she got eternal life she got an eternal blessing she recognized her Jubilee I'll say yes Lord yes to your will and to your way let's stand I'll say yes Lord yes I will trust you and Obey when your spirit speaks to me with my whole heart I'll agree and my answer will be yes Lord yes let me drop that a little bit lower let's worship him this evening oh hallelujah thank you Jesus I'll say yes Lord yes to your will and to your way I'll say yes Lord yes I will trust you and Obey when your spirit speaks to me with my whole heart I'll agree and my answer will be yes Lord yes once more oh I'll say yes or yes to your will and to your way I'll say yes Lord yes I will trust you and Obey when your spirit speaks to me with my whole heart I'll agree my answer will be yes Lord yes let's sing it once more oh I say yes Lord yes to your will to your way I say yes [Music] [Music] amen can I just can I just read a little more of your Jubilee what about the elect group what kind of a sign are they supposed to see what are they supposed to have Hallelujah it shall be lights in the evening time this day this scripture is fulfilled this day God's promise is fulfilled we know that to be the truth he is here tonight as he was then now to preach it that I said a while ago if you preach anything and it's the gospel truth then God is obligated to vindicate that that his soul let the god that wrote the word let the god that made the prophets Let The God Who is God of the word come forth prove that he is God he is still God as Elijah went up on the mountain watching Elisha went watching Elijah he said I want a double portion and the mantle that was on Elijah fell upon Elisha he walked down doubled that blanket up struck the river and said where is the god of Elijah and the same thing that happened for Elijah happened for Elisha and the same gospel the same power the same son of man that was yesterday is today and will be forever Hebrews 13 8 do you believe it then I ask you I cannot be him but he is here we are only a carrier amen aren't you thankful aren't you thankful tonight three tonight [Applause] amen let's give the Lord a big platform amen amen a big big one what a jubilee amen this is the working of the Holy Spirit that's what we want that's the way we want it when it's no longer a man Interruption but it's God himself speaking to his elect Oh Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory

lot of mustard seed God cannot speak like this just to be speaking no if God spoke this message and he put on my heart to call the brother and he already worked on the other hand you can tell we
