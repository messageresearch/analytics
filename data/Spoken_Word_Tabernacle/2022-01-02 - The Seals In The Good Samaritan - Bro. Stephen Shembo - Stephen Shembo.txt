wonderful wonderful service amen everybody up to date with the sermon let me see your hand okay okay okay especially young people i want to see your hand way up okay blessed be the name of the lord amen how many read revelation 6 if you didn't be my guest the next time you're going to do it when the pastor says amen unless you really know what's going on there let's go to the scripture matthew chapter nine on wednesday we spoke about the second part and we paul david and that anointing of david which is an anointing that attracted people in trouble amen so i have a big cargo this morning it's an 18-wheeler cargo amen but uh or brother mike bailey or some other brothers knows exactly what i'm talking about amen so let's see how tom will help me but if you didn't read revelation 6 then really really stay awake matthew 9 verse 9 if you're there you can say amen amen hallelujah amen and as jesus passed forth from there he saw a man named matthew we read this on wednesday sitting at the receipt of custom in other words the tax office and he says to him follow me and he arose and follow him amen and he come to pass he came to pass as jesus sat at meat in the house behold few publicans okay you might be seated somebody's awake amen many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciple publicans were not good people and when the pharisees saw it they say to his disciple why eat your master with publicans and sinners but when jesus heard that he said to them they that behold in other words they that are healthy need not a physician but they that are sick so jesus himself presents himself here as a doctor amen jesus is a physician the great physician right here jesus is a doctor amen but go you and learn what that mean i have mercy and not sacrifice this physician is emphasizing on mercy amen versus sacrifice who was offering sacrifice in the old testament the priest in other words the levitical priesthood amen everybody amen he's the one that introduced the priesthood but when he came to a certain point he say i prefer mercy versus the levitical priesthood amen and not sacrifice for i am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance everybody clear let's go to look 10. let's see if we can get to this samaritan this morning still a lot of folks out beginning of the year amen amen verse 30. if you're there you can say amen and jesus answering say a certain man went down from jerusalem to jericho there is a man who was in jerusalem and he was going down marquette toward jericho if he was leaving jerusalem toward jericho he was in a journey amen hallelujah and fell among thieves so this road is the first infested with thieves and fell among thieves which one stripped him of his reign man so when this man left jerusalem he was fully dressed amen in jerusalem this man was fully dressed amen he had his robe on amen but when the thief met him the first thing they did was to remove his clothes what was in the clothing that they were looking for the first action of a thief was to take his arraignment ever here or his clothing or his robe off of him that's what it's 15. you need to stay really awake because we're going to dig really deep amen okay i'm warning you and he fell among thieves which stripped his of his redment they never beat him first before they beat him they first removed his remnant the remnant that he had in jerusalem number one they removed his woman so in other words he's a man now without clothing everybody amen hallelujah and wounded him the second thing that the thief did they went into a physical assault at first they didn't warn them they just remove the clothes off once the first step is over the second one then they get into the physical amen and wounded him come out and departed number three they departed but when they departed how did they lift him a half dead right remember this you remember that right so one part was already dead amen was dead and there was a part that is alive so he was half dead what does he mean amen verse 31 and by chance they came down a certain priest that way so not only was he the one traveling there is a priest that came you need all this detail because when i begin to dig if you miss it it's a problem and by chance there came down a certain priest that way and when he saw him he passed by on the other side amen and likewise a lever when he was at the place came and looked on him and pass on the other side now you know now based on what we built a levat and a priest represented what which priesthood if you don't get something when you're in the service especially young men young people when you go home play the sermon over again amen that's how we learn verse 33 but a certain samaritan that same road this man thief priest levat and a samaritan a busy road and a certain samaritan as he did water so the samaritan also was journeying if you look on him here you will see him walking amen as he journeyed amen amen came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him from wednesday you understand what compassion is right the greatest key with this man is compassion help your children verse 34 and went to him and barred him and burned up his wounds the wound that was inflicted by the thieves pouring in oil and water so when he came he was binding his wound by using oil and wine to take care of the wounds amen [Music] and set him on his own beast not somebody else beast he didn't borrow one he got a beast so he took the man and put him on the beast so the man was no longer working the beast was working for him over here the man was walking after a while they put him on the beach beast the beast continued the journey hey mark here amen a certain his own beast come out and brought him to and in he brought him to an inner wish i have a bigger board he brought him to an inn and took care of him that's between him and the man that was wounded that was toward the evening time we already spoke about it amen then on the next day are we okay he changed gears amen amen and on the morrow when he departed the good samaritan he took out two pences two pence and gave to the host so on the first day he's the one ministering and when he's ministering he's showing compassion amen taking care of the wound pouring oil and wine he's doing a certain work amen but on the next day amen amen on a different day [Music] he switched the ministry to a host amen we okay amen we okay normally he was the one that have to finish that ministry do you hear me do you hear me he was when he started something he needed to finish it okay he was the one that have to take care of the man all the way up but he cannot do it all himself he came in did a certain work but he passed the baton to somebody anybody ever here in other words what he was supposed to do himself now it is done through somebody else [Applause] that person is called a host of the inn amen so the host of the inn took his place [Music] here so what the host of the inn is doing if you know the good samaritan well you think it's him in the house everybody here because everything the host is doing is just what the good samaritan himself was supposed to do ever here so on this day the next day here it is still the good samaritan everybody here right here it's the good samaritan everybody the only difference is the vessels are different it is the same man it's the same ministry everybody here it's only changed from one person to another [Music] amen amen you see why you need to put your head in the world [Music] you see now amen and say to him take care of him and whatsoever you spend more he gave him two pence amen two parents and he gave him an ability to expand more into his account anybody here and that man have a right to go in the bank account amen and pull certain things he can pull a money that you never seen before all right whatsoever you spend more when i come again so the good samaritan will come again in other words he will return for the second time when he come again i will repay you which now of these three thank you was neighbor if i get to that word naval to him that fell among fists and he said he that show water remember jesus say i desire water so the good samaritan showed mercy i desire mercy who does show mercy on him then say jesus to him go and do likewise in other words i want you also to be like that amen let's go now to the last one it's in 2nd thessalonian chapter 2. new year changing gears amen oh my god lord help me hallelujah 2nd thessalonians chapter 2 if you dare you can say amen hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord can be sleeping now we beseech you brethren verse 1 by the coming of our lord here jesus christ and by our gathering together to him remember shallow that's where everybody should gather that you should that you be not soon shaken in mind or be trouble neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that day of christ is at hand anybody care in other words don't let anybody upset you that i hate that day is at hand what is it what what paul is trying to say i thought we should tell the people the coming of the lord is coming the lord is coming that's true but paul is trying to point out something verse 3 let no man deceive you by any means for that day the coming of the lord shall not come except there come a water all that paul is saying is before you really really really really get very taken up to the coming of the lord you will see a sun coming out that sun is there will be a falling away as soon as you see it falling away then if you are sleeping out of church you need to wake up it's a signal that i am really coming now anybody here they will come and falling away first karma and that man of who be water if the man of sin is revealed that means he was hidden amen so there is a man of sin and that man of sin has been hidden or he has been sealed [Music] america he has been hidden and paul is saying if you really want to know that god is really at hand ever here the man of sin must be revealed everybody here in other words they must break the seal to reveal to you the man of sin [Music] amen come on everybody here the man of sin be with you come on the son of war this man of sin the bible is calling him the son of water who was the son of perdition judas did paul met judas i thought judas was dead am i reading a different bible when jesus betrayed the lord jesus christ he went they gave him money finally he found out that what he did was wrong he went back and gave the money away and did what hang himself judah was the son of perdition that's what the scripture said you need that scripture again i spoke about it many times you see me i'm gonna give it to you judas was the son of what perdition and judas was already dead when jesus christ was dead how do we again reveal judah over again everybody here and they say that that judah was the man of sin that's why brother branham said judah was the devil incarnated he never gave you scripture make sense so the vessel is not the man judah really it's who was inside of judah about here because you can remove judah but the judah is there let me help somebody else because you are alert now it's good everybody here elijah come five times the original elijah is in heaven ever here but the spirit of elijah can come upon somebody else but it's still elijah are we okay now are we okay now so when they say elijah has come brother branham is elijah if you look it's william marion branham but it's larger [Applause] it is not the same elijah of the old testament but it's still a larger by the anointing by the spirit by the ministry anybody okay because judah was already dead but they say nothing is going to happen until they reveal judah so judah was sealed [Music] amen verse 4 who opposes and exalt himself above all that is called god or that is worship who did that who did that in heaven he wanna go everybody here so that he as god sits in the temple of god showing himself that he is remember you not that when i was yet with you i told you these things and now you know that you know what we fold that he might be revealed in his water so paul is saying here that there is something that is blocking the revelation of judah not the revelation of judah at the first coming but the revelation of judah at the second coming before the lord jesus christ come and paul is saying there is something that is blocking that revelation amen and paul explained that it is um verse 6 and now you know what we what withhold that he might be revealed in water paul is saying that there is a time appointed for the revelation of judah before the coming of the lord in other words paul is saying that this unfolding of the man of sin this unfolding of the son of perdition this unfolding of judah is specified to a time anybody care in other words until that time arrive you cannot really understand the man of sin did you get it if that time is not yet in other words if god say at 12 o'clock the man of sin will be revealed you can try at eight o'clock you can try at nine o'clock you can try and even eleven o'clock you can even try at 11 50 55 you can even try at 11 59 you won't get the correct revelation of judah but once it's 12 o'clock there is nothing in hell nothing on the earth nothing in heaven that can block the fulfillment of that revelation automatically there will be an anointing coming up to unfold and reveal who judah is really anybody here hallelujah [Music] verse 7 for the mystery of water that's already water paul is saying that he's already working but you would not understand him very good because he's hidden you got to wait till the time that we explain you really how he operates then when you see that time jesus is not far away so and so the mystery of iniquity does already work in the time of paul only he who now lets amen we let and the one who's doing that is god i will explain you later until he be taken out of the way anybody here everybody here there is somebody that is controlling that ministry anybody care but there will come there will come a time that the one who have supreme control will be taken out yes amen in other words god is here back here and he's watching everything and back here but there will come a time that god will be taken out everybody the rapture is really the removing of the holy spirit from the gentile do you hear me do you hear me do you remember the 10th virgin they were looking for water oil amen so when god is coming as a big magnet he's just sucking the holy spirit out and back here do you follow me and if you have the holy ghost do you follow me when they are pulling your holy ghost you're not staying here they are pulling you and the holy ghost [Music] do you follow me this is a border again another border okay i take this water out i take a big magnet and i put it inside this bottle back here if i bring another magnet here do you follow me the magnet is attracting the magnet that is inside the bottom amen and you will see that magnet begin to go up and back here and but when it's going up the border won't stay there do you follow me the bottle also is going up do you hear me so when they see that's why when the holy ghost enters into you it seals you in other words the holy ghost cannot leave you anymore in other words the holy ghost is blocking you ever here even if the holy ghost want to go out he cannot go out anymore but here if you move the holy ghost is moving with you if you go to the left the holy ghost is going to the land so if they've kicked you out [Applause] everybody here so he that is blocking will be taken out ever here once they suck the holy ghost out then the antichrist have a free highway so you are the one that is slowing him down when the angel came down in revelation 10 he put one foot away and one foot where according to revelation 13 what comes on the earth there is a beast what comes from the water why is that angel blocking them here because john is here and back here that's why he's blocking them the day he removed his foot like this then you will really get it so don't stay here you need to go to heaven don't stay on this earth don't stay on this earth because of worldly thing you're gonna get them in the tribulation right back here verse eight and then shut that wicked one after he is removed everybody after they suck the holy spirit out then the wicked one the man of sin amen then that wicked one be water this is a second revelation now the first they are explaining you who is but this one when they take the holy ghost out he's really manifested plainly he's not playing games with you anymore anybody here and the wicked won't be revealed or manifested whom the lord shall consume everybody here with the spirit of his water remember in revelation 19 the lord is coming back again on the third coming and out of his mouth comes what the sword of the spirit which is the so after we go up somebody is fully manifested until the third coming when god is coming to destroy him first second third coming right here in the scripture and back here and then shall the wicked one be revealed whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth there is a word there is a sword coming up everybody here and shall destroy with the brightness of his water this is the third coming this is no longer the fourth coming back here verse 9 even him who's coming is after the working of who so you understand the man of sin now that's why he's a judah uh satan with all power and son and lying wonders and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish why do they perish come on because they receive not the water the love of the truth that they might be water so to be safe you must have water that's why you love the world [Applause] [Music] if you don't love the world something is wrong here you must have the love of the truth for you to be saved so not everybody is going to be saved amen all right let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you again father humbly this morning lord thanking you for your grace for your love and your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us lord thank you again for what you did last year and father you have given us an opportunity to gather together around the revealed word of the hour lord i have done what any man that you give ability to do can do lord but when it comes to interpret your word to give a revelation father it's only a work of the holy spirit lord this is algebra this is a deep things and father i'm praying that you forgive your children for anything that they have done that would hinder them from grasping into that revelation father may the power of the holy spirit come down and break the word in a way that it was never done before so that they can plainly see jesus christ manifested lord and that nobody get lost alone father be the alpha and the omega we seal the devil completely out of this place as we committed all in the name of jesus christ amen you stay awake all right we are the high priest in the good samaritan the purpose of this we talked about the priesthood where we have been talking about the mystery of the level but we want you to look at the good samaritan and when you look at the good samaritan you see the high priest into him ever here blessed be the name of the lord it's part three when we spoke on wednesday we start on this hebrew here chapter five verse one the bible said for every high priest taken from among men is so then for man in things pertaining to god that he may offer both gifted sin you already understand this but who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way for that he himself also is compassed with infirmities and we found out on wednesday that compassion is to do the will of god compassion brother obama say it's first you gotta know the will of god and then you gotta do it ever here but to qualify as a high priest here paul is saying that a high priest must be a human being and not only just a human being but a human being that is gifted with compassion compassion to understand the wicked people compassion to understand the ignorant and compassion to understand those that are out of the way and we found on wednesday that the law of ignorance was already given in the old testament and there was one law for the jews and one lawful also there gentile ever here and we found out that even the jews themselves were ignorant is everybody awake we have two groups here we have the jews and we have the gentiles everybody here anybody here the jews grew up with the law amen are you there the jews when they are born their law already existed they go to church [Music] amen right by the ebook there is a reason why i call him right by the evil the jews are born with religion [Music] everybody here the jews when they go to church they're going to train them on religion everybody here the jews will learn that every sabbath we need to be there everybody here the jews will learn that you must take a lamb and you must do this you must do this you must do this you must do this they will learn everything amen the jews were a real jew when you are born you cannot fall on the idol at you do you follow me but yet the jew were ignorant amen anybody cared so far if you ask the jew about the lord they can tell you about it back here that's why the rich young ruler are we okay when he came to jesus christ he was showing jesus christ that i never been in a nightclub [Applause] i never smoke i never drink i never prostitute myself all my life i grew up in the strict way as a message believer my father was a jew my mother was a jew and i grew up in the jewish religion but despite living under commandment under the law i still feel that i don't have eternal life amen everybody here everybody here so there was something about eternal life that is different than religion [Applause] everybody here it is different than just going to church it is different than just wearing long dresses it is different than just stopping makeup it is a very life of god in the life of a believer that brings a church not on the outside but a change on the inside [Applause] ever hear everybody here but the gentile did not know anything [Music] in other words there is a difference between the ignorance of a jew anybody here and the ignorance of a gentile blessed be the name of the lord the very ministry of jesus christ the bible say and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet hezei and when he had opened the book he found the place where he was written the spirit of the lord is upon me because he has anointed me to do what to preach the gospel to the rich [Music] okay to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal those that are healthy everybody here they're brokenhearted to preach deliverance to those that are free those that are captive are recovering of sight to those that see no to the blind or to set a liberty them that are bruised and to preach the water acceptable years of water in other words for god to be powerful somebody must be in trouble [Applause] everybody here ever here that's why the pharisee missed jesus christ because they thought they were right [Music] [Applause] they thought because they're born in the message they grew up in the message they have a right to go to heaven [Applause] brother branham said god does not have grandchildren god have sons and daughters in other words you must meet god yourself [Applause] are you there paul on they called himself that he was under ignorance but paul learned under the feet of the of gamalien he knew the scroll completely he knew they caught left and right but when he meets jesus christ something changing power [Music] hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord for our desire mercy and not sacrifice and the knowledge of god oh we don't need knowledge and the knowledge of god more than water this knowledge is light take second correction the speed is slow but i will try my best don't push me hallelujah i can feel it anybody here go to second corinthian somebody when they tire they want everybody to get tired [Music] they don't want to leave another people staying it brings condemnation they want you to stop so everybody come out let's go to second corinthians chapter four [Laughter] have you seen you say you can go and then you see they're watching i don't want to be the first one but in the art they want to go amen second corinthians chapter four verse six you there for god who commanded the water they lied to shine out of what remember in the beginning let there be light everybody here has shine in our water if you notice that light is not shining in the head amen anybody here it's a light that is shining in the heart have shine in our heart to give the water the light of the water the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of who so that knowledge is a light that comes to you recognizing your day recognizing your light hallelujah he said i desire mercy and not sacrifice because they have been doing sacrifice but the worshiper is not purging amen they were having doing all the commandments but the which young ruler still doesn't have eternal life he said i desire mercy and not sacrifice i desire the knowledge of god that knowledge that comes in your heart that's why brother branham say your priest your leader and so forth can teach you your religion ever here you can learn the message that we are trying to do what anybody here but that still won't give you water but here if that light is struck in your head you won't get eternal life here he said but you got to accept that person jesus christ you understand that all of you got to accept the person jesus christ to have water but sometimes other leadership gets so much influence on us till we don't know what to do when that times we get sucked up into big preachers in the message we got sucked up in to bring pastors in the message until we don't even know what the holy ghost means here personalities in the message so and so he's preaching everybody go there so so he's preaching everybody go there so and so he's preaching everybody go there never receive nothing that you got there sinner you cannot see him because the personality have taken influence over you instead of jesus christ everybody here so far ever here so far and paul is talking about the jewish he said i bear them record that they have a zeal of god when you look at the jews they are zealous for god [Music] they are zealous for god so they should have god ever here but not according to water no revelation the jews scenario is the scenario of people burning a message [Music] learn to play in the church they learn to be musician but there is no revelation to what they were doing the jewish could bring the lamb into the temple but they don't even understand why they're bringing the lamb to the temple they were not just bringing the lamb to the temple as a routine but that lamb was speaking about something [Applause] the ignorance of the jews but here for them being ignorant of god's righteousness and going about to establish the water this is when you begin to try to leave the message by yourself you begin to establish your own message by yourself everybody here have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of water there is nothing you can fabricate but you must meet god yourself even if you never smoke even if you never slept with a man even if you never thought the lie but you were born in sin sharpening iniquity coming into the world speaking life you must be born again [Applause] everybody here all your righteousness is a filthy rag everybody here i was born in the message i have nothing to do you must repent ever here the bible says that in jerusalem the people that were there were devout men how can peter tell devout men to repent they were good people they came to worship and peter said except you repent they said what can we do he say repent repent of what [Music] repent of what you never smoke you repent of what repent of what you are never in a nightclub you're going to repent of what ever here you must recognize yourself as a sinner [Applause] because what you living is a religion it is not an experience an experience is a life [Applause] oh my god blessed be the name of the lord in acts chapter 14 the bible says when paul performed a miracle the bible say which when the apostle barnabas and paul heard of them they rent their clothes because they came to worship them right back here and run in among the people crying out and saying sir why do you do these things we also are men of like passion with you and preach unto you that you should turn from these vanities unto the living god which made heaven and earth and the sea and all things that are doing who in time passed suffered water all nation to walk in their own water anybody here the gentile right back here are like people who were born outside the message [Music] everybody they didn't know better they grew up in the ghetto everybody's cussing everybody's drinking everybody's smoking everybody is doing bad thing ever here so the ignorance is an ignorance of unbelief in sin amen take acts 17. and back here here and the dangerous is the one born in the message because you feel like he doesn't need god here everybody here the one outside knows already the bad part and when a change happened he can quickly tell that i am changing because i was bad now i can see myself change but the other one was under religion it's like what else do i need everybody acts 17 16. if you're there you can say amen verse 16 now while paul waited for them at athens his spirit was stirring him when he saw the city holy holy now the word completely giving to water so paul get into us and everywhere adam you don't see that in israel except if he's or you're backsliding here in your home everything good mama put the picture of christ daddy put the cloud everything is good they were monitoring everything but in another somebody else home when you get there it's a naked woman on the wall when you get there there is beer over there there is a honeycomb sitting over there there is a bad wiser over there everything is a dollar tree and a big tv screen like this watching soccer on sunday or football [Music] that's the genta let's go to 24. everybody here god that made the world and all things therein saying that he is lord of heaven and earth dwell not in temple made with hands here neither is worship with man's hand as though he needed anything seeing he give to all life and breath and all things he's a good god verse 26 and has made of how many blood one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth and has determined the time before appointed and the bond of their habitation so god distribute it you go over there you go there you go there ever here verse 27 that that should seek the lord if happily in other words perhaps they might feel after him and found him though he be not far from every one of us here for in him we live and move and have our being as certain also as your own poet have said for we are also his offspring we are his children watch now clearly for as much then as we are the offering of god the children of god we ought not to think that the godhead is like to gold or silver or stone idolatry graven by art and immense device you ready verse 30 and the time of this water do you see the ignorance of the gentile the time of this ignorant god did water in other words god never looked at the gentiles because they didn't know any better ever here but adam said that's the reason why when they went to the witch doctor they can believe anything and god healed them through that belief somebody who can understand the ignorance that's the high priest he doesn't know any better because while we were yet sinners christ did what [Music] he understood your ignorance he said they don't know any better but they are my children i will handle them at a certain time ever here god wink at it but now command all men everywhere to do water ever here at the beginning he blinded his eyes he said i don't want to look at them they don't know what they're doing but now that i am revealing to the world everybody must repent everybody here so there is an ignorance of the jews and there is an ignorance of the gender the gender is completely turned from one way of living into a different way of living he can tell the difference quickly the jewish it's on the same place but the difference is on the revelation amen everybody my god let me rush quickly amen paul said that this i said therefore and testify in the lord that he has fourth walk not as other who gentle walk in the vanity of the man everybody having the understanding how being water alienated from the life of food through water that was in water because of the brightness of water that's why the light of the gospel comes to the heart i hope you're getting this very well blessed be the name of the lord who passed feeling have given themselves over until a seriousness to work on uncleanness with water they didn't know that's how they grew up grandpa casting 14 marriages changing husbands that's how i grew they didn't know any better ever here and peter said as obedient children not fashioning yourself according to the former lust in your water but as he which has called you is holy so be water in all manner of water because it's written be holy for i am water there is an ignorance of the jewish people and there is an ignorance of the gentiles but the high priest must understand the ignorance amen amen hallelujah let's go to hebrew chapter 2. so when you bring it to the high priest he's looking at you differently he's looking he said he's a gentile he didn't know any better what do you expect from him that's how he grew understand them but what is the desire of his heart does he want to serve god that's all i'm looking for i am not looking on the outside because it's just a matter of time and i will change the outside as long as i can change the inside [Music] anybody here hebrew 2 if you're there let's go to verse 9 let's see this high priest but we see who we know our high priest who was made a little lower than the angel the high priest must be human ever here for the suffering of death we talked about this crown with glory and honor that he by the grace of god should test death for who he's going to test it for everyone here for he became him for whom all things are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many water to water to make the captain of their salvation perfect through water my god verse 11 for both he that sanctifies remember this god and they who are sanctified we all are water for which cause he is not ashamed to call them water a bad case so far he's our brother yet he's a bigger brother because he's the high priest the high priest was a brother elevated among above the brothers remember saying i will declare your name to my brethren in the midst of the church i will sing our praise to you and again i will put my trust in him and again behold i and who which who has water so you the child that god gave to jesus everybody here me and my children me the priest and king and my children the sons of the high priest me and my children ever care for as much then as the children are partaking of water flesh and blood because we became human he must become human like me if we never became human no problem but because we became human the high priest cannot stay there be god and we human he cannot understand us everybody here ever here we are talking like human he's talking like god there is a conflict on our conversation so we must take god and put him inhuman then when we talk we understand one another everybody here so when he is pleading for us he is understanding us as human beings [Music] everybody here for as much then as the children are partaker of the flesh and blood he our high priest also himself likewise took the part of the same that through the true death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the and delivered them who true fear of death where all their lifetimes subject to water [Music] for verily he took note on him the nature of water if jesus would have come like an angel it's a problem [Music] when we sing amazing grace angels don't know what we're talking about because they were never have i mean lost and then get saved again angel wants you lost you lost forever hallelujah very he took note on him the nature of angel but took on him the nature of who the seed of abraham not natural now remember the spiritual seed ever here wherefore in all things he behoove him to be made like his water so there is nothing that you are that jesus was not amen god made sure that jesus is exactly like you in every aspect if you hunger jesus must hunger if you get upset jesus must be able to get upset [Applause] do you follow me you follow me if you walk you get tired jesus must walk and get tired if they give jesus a certain power he doesn't get tired god is unjust in every point everything he's just like you so when you are praying to jesus don't be praying to somebody like a big god somewhere like that talk to him like a human being do you follow me don't try to sophisticate your prayer don't try to make your prayers special oh hallelujah oh you the king of kings you're wasting your time here be normal sit down and say father i am upset you know what upset me and at this point if you don't help me i'll be in trouble talk to him like a man there is one mediator between god and man it's the man not the god the man jesus christ [Applause] everybody if you call your father do you think your father will say no he will come and say what's going on what do you think if you call him we have a tendency to feel like you got a bag and bag and bed and bed before god comes up he doesn't act like that you need to change your way of talking to him even when you don't feel like he's near he's already right there it's you to understand [Applause] my god let's go to verse 17. lord help me amen wherefore in all things he behoove him to be made life to his brethren that he might be what i desire what my friend god did detract that so jesus can be quick to be merciful [Music] so that he might be merciful ever here and a faithful water is somebody waiting and they fail for water high priest in faith returning to water to god to make reconciliation for the sin of the water for in death he himself has water being watered he is able to do what to say another one to help damn that i want her god let jesus be tempted just like you so when you are tempted jesus will remember ah i remember how bad he was let me quickly go help him [Applause] [Music] ever here he was tempted in no point he understand when you are tempted by a woman he understands when you are tempted by a man he understands when you are tempted by lust he knows it he was tempted of that when you talk to god you are talking to him like a man who doesn't understand sin that was in the old testament ever here listen to this brother branham say in uh john the first john first the bible says for all that is in the world the water and the lust of the eyes and the proud of life is not of the father but is of the water in other words everything that is in this world is summarizes in three categories the last of the flesh the last of the eyes and the pride of life everything that you do in life every attack that you have is only in these three categories if it's not under pride that's why you put your your your picture on facebook all the time it's either by something like that all of them it's only under those three categories ever here so jesus could go one by one and say this and use it disuse it no jesus went and summarized the three and say satan come and tempt me in those three aspects so i can cover everything by the bottom say a quick look at those scriptures which involve the lord jesus overcoming will bring out the truth of this proposition in matthew 4 when jesus is tempted of the devil he overcame the water the personal temptation of satan bridal and by the water in each of the three major trials that corresponded exactly to the temptation of the garden of eden the last of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life jesus overcame by water so everything that the devil can bring unto you even if you are not strong if you can stand on the word of god you can defeat everything without a vision [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah the bible says seeing them that we have a high priest that is passed into heaven jesus the son of god let us death let us hold fast our profession in other words don't let loose because he's understanding you for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the water of our water paul is telling you the man that is there that you pray to understand you very well it is not a man that doesn't understand if matter of fact when they when they touch you they are really touching him everything somebody is doing to you he's understanding that in his body in heaven amen hallelujah he said he cannot be touched with the feelings of the feeling of her infirmities but was in water how many points all points what like water yet without water why did they tempt him so he can understand when you're tempted amen let us therefore come home that's why you don't pray afraid everybody care because the man that you're praying to knows what is going on matter of fact the god even took sin and put on his body so he can feel sin amen hallelujah let us therefore come broadly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain water i desire water and found grace to help in the time of water so when you are in need what do you have to do take it to the lord in prayer but when you're praying you're praying sincerely and talking to him plainly don't even go left and right that you understand what i'm saying no tell him this is what i have done father i did it i'm struggling but i don't want to do it but there is something that is taking over me and i found myself doing it but in my heart i don't want to do it would you please help me [Music] [Applause] but here then the christian life is not hard anymore it is hard because you're trying to help yourself you cannot help yourself you are failure to begin with you need to depend on god god who is reaching mercy to come and help you because he went through the cross because of you why do you want a double worker you're carrying a luggage and somebody stopped with a car and they pick you up and you take the carriage and then you hold it sitting in the car [Music] open the trunk put it in the trunk sit in the car and relax this high priest must be touched with the water a high priest it's very important for the high priest to have the feeling [Music] back here brother bottom said there was a man a preacher who argued with his wife about here and when they finish arguing he was going out and he turned he said love you and his wife said love you and they went and he and his wife begin to cry about here and what random say the preacher begin to go and say what about if something happened what about if i get in the car wreck what about if something happened to me and i'm dead right now am i going to leave my wife like this then the more he goes he stops he says let me go back again he went right away he said love you she said love you brother adam said this time he was with water [Music] [Applause] you can say i love you to your brother you can say i love you to your children you can say i love you to your wife but you must understand the feeling behind i love you if i love you that's a hell feeling it's hypo hypocrisy that's why it's not working hallelujah if somebody say thank you or you talk to somebody did you receive what i gave you yes thank you uh and and you were saying what there is no feeling maybe next time that person will never give you something because you never appreciate it you never stop and say brother thank you very much for giving me this you took it for granted [Applause] everybody here don't wait for somebody to remind you if they gave you something whether it's an apple whether it's a coca-cola never waited go back and say thank you very much for giving me this because the children of god are thankful don't wait for them to call you and say did you receive what i said oh i'm sorry i was so busy thank you very much it's too late the high priest must have feelings what is the power of feeling brother branham he said these wikis enriquetas have that that have so such the words i have called them wiki and wikita god gave me to understand i should not do that anybody here because that is many of them are still his water a high priest must understand they're ignorant [Music] when you say ricky among those wicked they are children of god they just don't know yet and you are calling them ricky and their father say be careful because you call in general but under there i have not called some of them you need to be careful but here he said they can't help because they act so much different some of these old called formal churches has got them that spirit upon them they just pick up things from religion from panic also from presbyterian but here they are in a prison as israel was in prison just as much as moses went down to deliver them from slavery human being that love jesus christ would serve him if they only know what to serve him by and they are in bondage and the denominationalism that tell them don't do this and don't do that religion but here they don't know any better and brother bottom say moses lost the feeling of his people because they would not listen to him amen how are you going to pray for them moses everybody here brother roy you see your dream and now i cannot go with a ministry like that until i feel different in my heart about it no matter if god till tell me can i read it again brother what adam say if god tell me to go i won't go [Music] because i don't have any more feeling i cannot operate like a high priest anymore you cannot touch my children he said something got to changing me because i in my heart if i go out there feeling the way i do now i still feel that they ought to have heard that message i preached to them high heel they still do it i preached to them stop makeup they still put it i preach to them stop painting your nails they're still doing it they don't want to listen i can pray for them because you're not the one changing them if god doesn't want to change them if you change that way then you can pray for them if you think they must hear me don't preach them hallelujah if i still feel that they ought to have heard the message they ought to have done it and i don't have the feeling for the people that i should have until i can get that feeling there is no need in me going because i'll be here all these years i try to serve him with a true heart and i won't go out there being a hypocrite i got to feel that that it is not ricky enriqueta it is not this bunch it is god's children that is in water if you say ricky you didn't understand but if you say it's a child of god that is just deceived by the devil then your approach is different then go ahead you can do it but here that i must go until i can feel that way i just have to loaf around preach some convention and think but do what the feeling is important a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our water everybody here so far the bible says that when he was coming to the sheep he that has been possessed with devil prayed him that he might be with him that's legion how bit jesus suffer him not but say unto him go home to that friend and tell them how great things the lord have done for thee and had compassion on them brethren if any man be overtaken in your fault ye which are spiritual [Music] you must be spiritual you must be a good high priest if you're not a good high priest don't go everybody here sister we so disappointed of you we never thought you can do something like this don't go don't go don't go talk to him brother branham said even if you go see somebody who's sick don't tell him that oh you lost so much weight like this don't go to the hospital stay in your home because there is no feeling hallelujah lead with your spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of water considering water lest there also be water a high priest have also infirmities that's why when he's trying to help he's remembering what he also did himself ever here and then bear you want another water and so fulfilling their love who a high priest must have compassion okay compassion to the ignorant in the message and outside the message and then he must understand the people that are out of the way if not don't go don't go show them how much you know [Music] don't go show them how much you go i'm gonna prove to them that they don't know nothing your feeling is wrong you're gonna get in the debate you win the debate but they don't change many debating the message over the internet young people in the message debating debating no solution because there is no feeling it's a show off but when you approach like a high priest after your debate after your conversation somebody will go home and say i need to get closer to that sister when she was talking to me it was not really the word it is the high priest that is filling that person everybody here so far everybody here so far now buckle up are you ready praise god you ready i spoke to you that jesus comes in three names son of man means water prophet son of god means what ever priest and son of death it means what ever here so far hallelujah brother branham say he came first as the prophet and they crucified him his own crucified him he came as the son of man then after the holy spirit came he was there so when jesus departed and the church ages started it was the same jesus that came back on the day of pentecost but when he's coming on the day of pentecost he's not coming as the son of man but here he's feeling the disciple as a priest [Music] hallelujah he was the holy spirit son of god he lived through the set the church ages as waters in other words throughout the seven churches he is a priest ever here so throughout the church ages he is rescuing his children he is a priest [Music] [Applause] [Music] my god hallelujah in the millennium he will be son of david sitting upon the throne of his father david he is the son of david after his death burial and resurrection he came on the day of water as water as a priest why because somebody's in trouble somebody is out of the way i'm going to the gentile the gentiles are ignorant they don't know nothing about me i cannot come as a son of man because son of man is prophet jewish people were trained under prophet samaritan were trained on the prophet but the gentiles does don't know what a prophet is i must come as a priest to understand their ignorance [Applause] are we okay did i lose somebody did i lose someone we okay she said praise be the name of the lord he said god the spirit in the form of the what was he doing he was changing himself making himself known to his people in a different form the holy spirit which is god he came to deal through the water as a son of god the water why is he coming as a son of god to the seven church churches i'm leaving israel i'm going to get a bread out of the gentile for my name's sake because i came to the jews and the jews received me not the jews rejected me and they crucified me but all those that are there they don't know moses they don't know isaiah they don't know the prophet they don't know the law if i approach them as son of man they would not understand me if i told them moses said they don't know who moses is if i say david say they don't know who david said i must be a priest so when i'm preaching to them i'm i'm i'm preaching to them knowing that they don't know what the jews know [Music] everybody cares so far because to the jews he could tell them search the scripture in them you think you have eternal life they are testify of me if you come to the gentile you say search the scripture with scripture the gentiles didn't have god we didn't have god we have endearmed from the commonwealth of israel which scripture do i know so i must flip myself as a son of god as a priest because i'm dealing with ignorant people and the people that are out of the way that's how i can feel their infirmities [Applause] you okay [Applause] lord have mercy you okay if he comes as a priest to the seven church edges let's go in the seven church ages you have time you have time don't blame me back here back hold up you ready brother bonham said he came on the day of pentecost here as a priest and he went to the gentile to begin to pull his children because he made us king and priest he's pulling us one by one but something happened ever here when he poured himself down on the day of pentecost judah didn't leave him you okay judas didn't leave him everybody here the spirit that was on judas follow also back here and enter in the church but here because there is a true vine and there is a force vine and both of them are mixed together back here that's why when brother branham said ricky ricky the brother brother but god said no no no no no there is a mixture on the vine you you are calling all of them rickett miner not wikita okay branham so to avoid that stop calling everybody wicked ever here over here so the spirit of judah entered there and begin to work up relax now hallelujah brother adam said remember in the churches when he opened the first churches back there we found out that the holy spirit was against certain things they got started in that church age and that was called the water the deed of the water the nicolaitan you remember it how many knows that where's your hand boy i need to preach on the church ages i need to preach on the church ages when you have time go home and go read revelation chapter two okay you're gonna see if possible if you don't have the church's book you need it talk to the trustee i am willing to pay for you to get you all the church ages book you don't need to pay just tell me you need it i give it to you everybody here he said out the holy spirit was against certain things they got started in the churches and that was called the deed of the nicolaitan god said there is something in the church that i hurt it's the deed of the nicolaitan what is the deed of the decorator the church started on the day of pentecost and god came and filled the church with the holy spirit you follow me and the church was filled with the spirit of god and the church began its journey [Music] the church began its journey filled with the holy spirit are we okay now do you are you catching up now are you catching up now somebody is lost ever hear on the day of pentecost god god went to jerusalem [Applause] in the upper room and god filled his church 120 people he filled them with the holy spirit because the holy spirit is our robe [Music] the holy spirit is your wedding government remember here everybody have the same spirit the same government that's why when jesus entered he saw somebody without a government he said how did you get friend he said take him outside he was missing the robe here because we were born in sin sharp in iniquity coming into this world speaking water jobs say i was born naked show me one person who was born with clothes here nobody everybody here even the clothing you wearing now in the eyes of god you don't have them amen everybody here the only way god can see you with clothes is you must have the holy ghost when you have the holy ghost god when he look at you he sees you in the white orb [Applause] here that's why in the age of lord this year he said you who are naked and black come and buy for me come i'm gonna give you a cloth here so far so in jerusalem the holy ghost came and filled the church and the church received a robe and the church began a journey ever here but when the church began a journey somebody also following the journey we okay now hallelujah what is the deed of the decollete the bible said me cow body problem means what somebody's coming to conquer you ever here to conquer latin laity means water so laid to me collecting to conquer there somebody is coming after the church to conquer the church because the church has received from something and the church has begun its journey and somebody attacked the church to do what ever here take the holy spirit are you awake out of the water what is the government god put in the church and the nicolet and spirit is trying to do whatever it is take the garment do you get it do you get it take the holy spirit off the church and give it to one holy man let him be the boss of water in other words nobody can receive the holy ghost only preachers [Music] but here where are we going brother stephen stay tight and buckle up he said he start out to do what the neglected spirit notice he has no crown that's why i told you to read revelation 6. i'm sorry if you lost i told you amen i even felt like i need to send you a message in the morning because we were on the party of new year's eve a new year amen the white house rather i'm speaking of here a boy and a crown was giving him after all he had no crown to start with but a crown was giving him you need to listen carefully i'm preaching the seals right there ever here notice later he was given a crown yet three of them three on one that was 300 years later at the water is saying here that the church started in jerusalem yes here and brother branham said when they start in jerusalem right here in jerusalem ever here as the church began to progress something happened somebody attacked the church and when they attacked the church the first thing they were trying to do to the church was to remove the clothing off from the church everybody here back here and that attack brother branham said he went all the way to the nazi council hallelujah lord help your children amen when he start out a spirit of nicolet and to form an organization among the people and then he kept on going on going on become a saying then it became a doctrine you remember christ speaking back to the church the hatest it's in the book of revelation the deed of this nicholaten which i hate you trying to conquer take the water just only one man he could forgive all the sin and everything brother obama said the spirit when he start working he start working as a white horse here he starts from the time of paul all the way to the nazi castle where is the nazi council i want you to stay tight now amen but what i'm saying then at the first great night scene council when i read that i just fell on my knees the great nazi council has taken place in water in 325 this is a different deal my friend all of them was brought together the bishop the father of the christian faith was brought together in nursing that is the reason he was called the nursing cancer in eddie 325 if the spirit of nicolaitan which expressed itself as a white horse attacked the church from its birth all the way to 325 let us stress that in the church ages as jesus is the high priest are we there when we look at the age of emphasis and we blow it up fs is starting 53 and ended in 170. you who are on the computer make sure this is big on the computer so somebody can study it at home everybody here brother bonham said he went all the way to 325 if we bring 325 we found that 325 truly is greater than 53. but 325 is also greater than 170. so there is no way we can put 325 right there he doesn't match any question [Music] any question did i lose anybody it's not right when we brought up the second church of jesus the second church age is starting 170 until 3 20 at 3 12 when we put 325 there 325 is true it's greater than 170 but 325 is also greater than 312. you on the computer leave it right there ever here not to screen one screen so you can study home but here there's no way 325 can reach there please ever here it's not working when we go to the third church ages when we blow it up we see that the third church ages start at 3 12 and it goes all the way to 606 we found out that 325 here is truly greater than 312 and it's less than 606 so this is the perfect spot we can put it there any questions so far ever here if it's the perfect spot so 325 feet on the third church and marquia we can put it there so when brother branham is saying that this spirit of the worst horse started from the day of pentecost and it's going all the way to 325 what brother problem is telling you is the first spirit which is the white horse rather cover the three churches any question are we okay did i lose anybody so this spirit stopped on emphasis and went into uh uh esmuno and went into pergamus and when he went into programs the devil changed hosts you follow me he left the white horse and he picked up another horse everybody here so far but when the devil is attacking like this because we have four horses the first horse is which color that's why i told you read revelation 6 the second one is what the third one is water the fourth one is water ever care how many how many beasts do we have in the side of god the first one is water the second one is water the third one is what man the fourth one is water everybody here these four beasts brother bottom say a beast in the bible represents a power so the devil is using power to destroy the church of the living god but here god could not stand quiet anybody here god have to react [Music] hallelujah in 325 he was given a crown so when god reacted what happened brother branham say as the antichrist went well how many on his beast of ministry god sent forth how many beasts a beast to combat him for every time the beast rode on his horse the antichrist wrote on his walls on his beast to announce his ministry god sent his beast also on and he was on that to announce his combat to it when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the lord raises a water in other words there is an action too there is a reaction to the action ever here when the devil attack and he's using the white house god look he said which number is he using he said let me match him up he said lion go ahead hey hey so so when the enemy went out as antichrist god sent a certain type of power out to meet him he went out as a red horse another color another power another ministry god sent another one after him to combat him to hold water to protect his church so when he comes as the white horse rather god attacked with a lion did i lose anybody did i lose anyone hallelujah after 3 25 the devil changed his ministry remember under the white house rather the devil all he wants to do is to remove the holy ghost anybody here from the church and back here what is he doing when he changed colors brother branham said the doctrine of the nicolaitan the same thing that started then we found out it was deed to begin with in the next church age he became a water and then he become a water a physical assault did that lose anybody did i lose anybody did i lose anybody did i lose anybody the first thing removing the closing off then the physical absolute [Music] [Applause] everybody here they persecution in the dark water brother branham say dark ages where is the dark ages blessed be the name of the lord everqueer i'm preaching the seals right now but here brother branham say i am calling for the mortyology from the time of saint augustine of apple until water brother branham said it start from saint augustine of harper until what 1586 we need to find out when this man was born ever here brother adam said on the roman meteorology the roman catholic church put 68 million protestants to die was he sold red was there was he riding a red horse what was it the same power the same rudder there is this seal they admit 68 million on the meteorology beside all those put to death outside of that during the dark ages there were millions fed to lion and slaughter in every way because they would not bow down to the catholic dogma give me more from the second seal that was broke last night he had taken peace from of the earth and did kill one another his own meteorology of the roman catholic church show that they put 68 million protest and death from the time of who sent augustine of hapo until 1570 something he said 86 he said 1580 something about here now 68 million recorded on meteorology when one of their so-called sent got the revelation that anybody that disagree with the roman church should die as a heretic it's this man that did it and he was the one that endorsed christmas [Music] you need a coach you see me boy he went to spilling blood he jumped on his head rose and went on water riding but help me now he was in the edge that augustine of apple he was born in witch age everybody here now we have 354 to 15 86 or 15 eddies ever here set forth the precept that the church ought and must use force if necessary bring her children back to the fold and that he was in harmony with the word of god to kill the heretic and apostate ever here watch here clearly but random concerning the 68 million slain by the catholic church what time in history did this take place but what i'm saying text marker glorious reform a reformation i get some of this color heaven and it's the history of the church by saint augustine of hapo which was in africa that was eddie water 354 and he lasted till water somebody got it brother branham instead of saying 1580 he's saying what take me as a dutchman i'm putting all of this so nobody come to you after church and say your prophet say here this way that's why i'm vaccinated everybody here he lasted till 1850 the massacre of what if you go in history the massacre of harlem happened in 1580. brother branham just flipped numbers i'm saying that so when they tell you you know what to answer everybody here so the time of to let me say that one 354 to 1580. he put it 1850. according to the history and back here there were 68 million protestants same concept put to death recorded on the roman meteorology for disagreeing with the pope rome now if we go back to our chart here 350 is right here anybody care now anybody here and if you look at the edge of sardis and you pull it out here it starts from 1520 to 1750. what random say it's 1580. you can see it feeling ready everybody here so when we put it there we come so right there you can see that the second seal started right in the middle here and went all the way there it looks like the seals start in the edge and it's finishing the edge and another one pick up in the middle of the brother branham called that overlapping i already preached to you about that ever here so when he said the red horse rather he start assaulting the christian now no more speaking the word now he's assaulting the christian physically killing them god have to react what did god react every time a religious power went forth to meet the challenge of the political power of the world when the lion was up the religious power he went to meet the roman power then when he come to the sacrifice hour the ox went because he is a sacrifice beast of the water so when he comes like a red horse rather god sent the ox anointing and not is a sacrifice for what a beast of sacrifice that's why you saw christian accepted to die for the death of christ ever here they were not doing that by their own power the anointing that came in was an anointing of sacrifice that's why when they want to queen christian the christian went slowly and they cut their head and they were singing the glory of god everybody here death where is your sin death where grave where is your water it was not a problem with them you cannot combat the devil on yourself you need to be under an anointing [Applause] everyone cares so far did i lose anyone blessed be the name of the lord brother branham the second age was the red horse rather which was the dark ages the next age was the who the third beast the edge of one which was the water he was the edge of the water but the one that was speaking in the age was represented as a man that is wisdom smart shoot but the bottoms continue he said the reformer down through the church ages come the face of a man and the reformer has been seized who in green and then and then on down to water [Music] [Applause] so death third horse rather when he killed he killed he killed he killed he got tired the christian are still increasing in number he said this is not working then he flipped and then he changed he changed the horse to a black one and the black one brother branham said from the church the dark ages all the way to the pentecosta which goes right there that brings the third the black horse ever here it is the edge of the reformer did i lose somebody he's saying in revelation 3 the bible say remember luther was the age of sardis and back here the fifth age is sardis the messenger to service was luther i need to buy you church in this book but here unto the angel of the church of sardis luther these things say he died of the seven spirit of god and seven star i know that work and that has a name that that leaves an award somebody's catching somebody's catching are we there be watchful and strengthen the things with what that are ready to water in the age of luther the church was half dead everybody okay and not only that when they opened the third seal about here and the black horse was coming and begin to destroy now the element of the church god screams from his throne god sent a measure of penny for a measure of wheat but touch not the water and the what what did they use here and what everybody okay did i lose somebody everybody here the voice said in the midst of the beast call out dare come to see what it is he was in there in these living creatures and he wore and he saw the black horse the voice in the midst of the four beasts call out a measure of pain and of which for water three measures of valley for water wheat is what would make bread barley they make bread with it both barley and wheat three measure cuts to water a penny but see that you heard not water what is a penny brother branham says this uh the bible says this in matthew 20 verse 1 for the kingdom of heaven [Music] i need to change the title so you can remember this sermon pretty good i'm gonna call that the seals in the good samaritan [Applause] everybody okay so you're gonna trace it quickly everybody okay he said that the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a household holder which went out early in the morning to hire a laborer into his water and when he agreed with the labor for a water a penny a water a penny was a salary of a whole day how can a bread cost the salary of a whole day it is a time of famine that's when inflation hit and the price goes up everybody okay everybody okay that's why brother branham say that the third seal is water you got it now but that's not the water and the water why the order and the one but symbolizing spirit all symbolize the spirit and one is water daddy dust spill with your water here ever here the antichrist enter and begin to play with the bread with the word of god with the stuff of life when god look he said you can touch that one but do not touch the oil and do not touch the wine don't touch the holy ghost and don't touch the joy [Music] [Applause] everybody here david says listen he said cast me not away from the presence and take note the water from me and restore unto me the water not to restore unto me my salvation by the joy of my salvation everybody here everybody here why go your way eat the fat drink the sweet send portion unto them that was nothing that for whom nothing is prepared for this day is holy unto the lord neither be water for the water the joy of the lord is water you may have the holy ghost but you can go down in your spirit everybody here but when you climb the mountain by the polycarp and you go into the mountain climbing the mountain is a hard thing but when you get to the top of the mountain then the joy of the lord comes and that joy gives you strength that's why you come to church sad but as you live in the church you feel like you are charged the joy of the lord is giving you strength straight for the journey [Music] i'm sorry give me time so i can land ever here ever here the joy brother branham said the joy of the lord is our strength that is our strength that is how we live is by the joy of the lord that is in our water wow what is causing that joy brother branham he said the power of revelation brings water [Applause] [Music] everybody here that's why when you are down at home going through many trouble and the pillar in the tape is playing and suddenly something struck you from the top and it brings you joy [Applause] ever hear when they are preaching the word there is something in you that is kind of happy and when it's happy you are forgetting the time you are forgetting how tired you are you don't want to get away with it it is the joy of the lord it is the power of the revelation it is the one of the stimulation [Applause] [Music] hallelujah do you know the reason why the disciple went in the upper room because they were afraid but when the holy ghost came and stimulated them they came like junker [Applause] everybody here everybody here it's like a story i heard before of a cat that was chasing the mouse and the mouse was running and suddenly the mouse fell into wine and when he drank wine he was no more afraid of the cat he came to the cat looking at the cat like this and the cat began to back up [Applause] because it's the power of the stimulation of the revelation [Applause] everybody here that's why when david came when he read goliath speaking revelation struck david the height of goliath was nothing the weapon of goliath was laughing david look at goliath he said these are circumcised he got the revelation that was hidden behind the clubs of [Applause] ever goliath he said go light i'm gonna catch your head because the seed of the woman shall bruise the head i need your head [Applause] give me time i'm gonna let you know hallelujah the power of wine natural wine is to do what is to bring a present that is all slumped down to water that's why it's good to come to church when you down don't stay home go to church so they can stimulate you and when you go home you're ready to fight again [Applause] everybody here there is a power of the revelation of the world give stimulation of joy to the believer stimulation of water stimulation that is water it is water touch not the oiled one because that healed the wound the wound that your boss got you at work but when you come on wednesday night you can feel something is happening you are forgetting the boss because somebody is putting wine somebody's putting one your father yelled at you your husband did something wrong when you go to church you are forgetting everything you become joyful somebody is putting oil and wine in your wound hallelujah hallelujah therefore for us there started riding the middle of loud this year and end up to the prodigy [Applause] amen the brothers is in laodicea but it's really not in laodicea goshen was in egypt but he was separated in egypt the plague could hit egypt but not goshen the broad age is an age within an angel but it's for christ and his bride alone [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah that's where the white house that's where the pearl horse rapping and the pear horse rather brother branham said one comes off the eagle age let me skip this for the timer everybody here so when god when the devil came like that god sent a flying ego [Applause] for responses from god here but if you notice we have the first one here that is the white horse then he moved into a physical absolute then he moved to this one ever here and brother branham say truly the fourth horse is not a new one [Music] when you take the white color plus the red the blue color the red color plus the black color that's what is giving you the water that's why the man only received three things one two three the enemy come to steal kill and water and they stop there the fourth one is a mixture of the tree [Music] and so far ever here but if you notice from the day of pentecost all the way to laodicea if you look at the darkness there is increasing in other words the church is going i work here yet it started there [Music] the journey started from water but it's going well everybody okay everybody okay the church begin at water repentance toward god and the baptism in the name of jesus christ for a mission of sin beginner to attack listen to you you listen you people who belong to church the church never started a narcia it started in water on the day of water started the church luke 24 and the repentance and remission of sin should be preached in his name among all nations beginning where jesus stole the disciple being assembled together with them commanding them that they should not depart from water but wait for the promise of the father the church started his journey its journey at jerusalem but the journey was going who attacked him if we come in again this man leaving jerusalem and going down and he fell into the hand of thieves brother what i'm saying a big wicked city always a wicked city jericho as far as i know still a wicked city in the bible he represented the road to water jerusalem sat on the hill jericho set in the water and the good samaritan found a man coming from jerusalem down to jericho when he fell among water think of it he was water [Applause] [Music] the church was what everybody here back sliding coming from there to the water jericho is a cursed city jerusalem is a blessed city he was on his road back sliding when he fell among thieves and rabbit that strip him that is when you shall fall among thieves and rubber when you start backsliding away from god just expect the enemy to be along the water ever here so remember the church right there if you look at the color the color black is getting bigger and bigger until now odisha is completely black out here now he fell among the thieves who is the fifa in john 12 verse 4 the bible said then say one of the disciples judas iscariot someone's son which should betray him why was not this ointment sold for 300 pence and given to the water this he said not that he cared for the poor but because he was uh judah the son of perdition okay judah the son of perdition was a thief and he was the devil incarnated back here in john 17 while i was with them in the world i kept them in that name those that gave me a cape and none of them is lost by the son of who but they must reveal him in the end time ever here john 6 jesus answered them have i not choose you to have and one of you is a water he was a devil [Music] so the fifth spirit came from the devil from the son of position he spoke of judas is carrying the son of salmon for he was that should betray him being one of the water ever here now he that is washed needed not safe to wash his feet but he's clean every week he are clean but not what for he knew who should betray him therefore he said you are not all water clean judah was not clean he was a devil and he was also a fifth if the spirit of a thief come upon you what are you going to do so if thieves attack him they got the spirit from who everybody here brother branham said in his time the revelation at the breaking of the seals we know exactly what he was who the man of iniquity who is this man of sin this fellow that is working iniquity but he be revealed in his time the mystery of iniquity does already work deceiver deceiving the people only he god that letter with less until dear christ the bride be taken out of the way amen by removing the holy ghost then shall the wicked one be water at the breaking of the seals at his time paul say not in my time but in the time when he shall be what in the end time ever here let me rush now to the airport the coming of the lord and the gathering of him as god will gather his people to him in the last day the gathering of the people of the lord not to the church to the lord gathering together unto him the man of sin the man of sin be revealed the son of perdition that was who i'm going to skip this because you already got the son of perdition what am i saying brother of adam say while jesus was upon the earth so was judas each came from a different spirit and upon death each went to his own water judah came from here jesus came from heaven god filled jesus with the fullness of the godhead badly and the devil also filled judah with the fullness of the devil badly but here that's why judah was a devil here so when jesus died judah could not stay that's why he hang himself so the spirit of jesus going back to the father and the spirit of judah going back to hell so on the day of pentecost the spirit of jesus came back on the children of god the spirit of judah came also back in the church the spirit of jesus led they came back upon the true church and the spirit of who came back on the water right there in revelation water in other words the seals were judas back again in the church everybody here see how that judah spirit came back as hell on the water he was white so close to the real just as judah was so close to jesus a crown was given to him white horse water so when the church started judah came here and judah was a fifth and when this man started his journey coming down from jerusalem because of the spirit of judah coming also following the journey of the church the fifth spirit attack him number one trying to remove his clothes take the holy ghost off the church and number two get into persecution and try to kill the man and leaving him half dead any question so far any questions so far our sin is a very cursed city jericho is in the valley jerusalem is on the hill and a man like we read in the good samaritan when he was coming down from jerusalem going to jericho he was backsliding coming out of the city of the blessed going to the city of the curse and that when he fell among the thieves and gas strip and wounded laying water meaning spiritually and physically ever here back home so i can land this plane ever here hey we found out that the three seals happened under these fields back here and normally when you travel you travel with a purse jesus said to the disciple take nothing for your journey neither staff script neither bag bread neither money nor to coat so this man has a bag that he was traveling with and that bag has money and they took money off which was faith the origin of faith that started in pentecost the fifth remove it but i will wish toll [Music] say the lord ever here so this man was left half dead then came the priest and then came delivered the first one was a priest the second one was delivered ever here both of these represented you remember you remember you remember but the levitical priesthood cannot help and the mercy that's why they could not do anything [Applause] they love moses cannot work on you anymore everybody okay everybody okay paul's wolf had become nicolaitan they were trying to form a priesthood like the water [Music] which was for ran to the new testament to utter they're trying to bring the levitical priesthood under mercy the priesthood while the high priest was already disqualified by tearing his clothes out everybody so far let me rush quickly saying that our lord sprung out of the nation that no not moses never even spoke of him came out of the priesthood our lord sprung out of the tribe of judah not out of liver for they were carnal legalists can use legalistic and the melchizedek but our lord came out of judah there you are where the promise was what so the levitical priesthood could not do anything through the church ages we need another priest who can be the one who can feel who can have compassion that's why the good samaritan when he comes he comes with compassion ever here somebody that can understand the ignorant and somebody that can understand those that are out of the way but here so far so we found the samaritan coming why is samaritan lord help me brother obama say we know there is only three nationalities of people always there is hammer shem and jeffers people that is the the gentile and the witcher which is samaritan is what and what [Music] [Applause] [Music] ever here the lord have to come as a samaritan because the body of a samaritan has a mystery it's a body that have jews and gentiles into one body he has a blood offered jew and a blood of agenda mixed together into one body [Applause] amen here the everybody is half jew and water [Music] lord help me hallelujah the bible say don't answer the jews and say unto him say we not well that you are a what they call jesus a samaritan and this man was a good water do we know his name [Music] do you know his name he was a good samaritan the bible says in mark 10 and when he had gone forth into the way there came one running and knelt down and ask him what what shall i do that i mean with what and jesus said unto him what causes me what there is none water but who is good so the good samaritan is who you are [Applause] brother branham he said the fourth mystery of the new testament church as one body one man composed of what and not water that's why he came as a samaritan because that's a representation of his church the church started jerusalem with jewish people first and then we gentile begin together so the body of jesus christ which is the church of jesus christ content jews and gentiles when we go in the rapture we are going to win the rapture with paul with peter with all the disciples it's jews and gentiles together that's the body of jesus christ that's the body of the good samaritan hallelujah hallelujah the bible said that at the time you were without christ being alien from the commonwealth of israel and stranger from the covenant of the prayer of promise having no hope without god in the world but now in christ jesus ye who sometimes were far off i may do not what nigh for he is our who has made buff and has broken the water of partition between ever here and that he let me go here having abolished in the flesh the enmity even the law of commandment contained in ordinances for to make in himself of the two what a new samaritan so making water lord help me hallelujah how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery he may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ what is the mystery paul which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of man it is now revealed unto his holy apostle and prophet by the water what is the mystery that there should be water and of the same the same the same and particular of the the promise in christ by water the same body that the jews are we also are there and the body that have jewish and gender is a samaritan body hallelujah then he pick up the man and put him on his horse every year then he switched the ministry from himself to a host ever here because throughout the seven church churches he was son of god he was a priest but before his coming in between son of god and son of david he have to come back again as a son of man not his body but a host a host another person must take on his ministry to bring the redemption and the restoration of the body of jesus christ and right here ever here he must move from son of god over here and come back as son of man it is not him but is his ministry and he take the ministry and he give it to a host ever here ever here and the host now is the one taking care of the body he's the one taking care of the church [Music] [Applause] i gotta stop somewhere ever here ever here the host is not jesus christ but the roster is revealing jesus christ to you [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah oh my god hallelujah the good samaritan [Applause] the bible saying remember the good samaritan that found the man wounded he brought him in the water which is what [Music] which church which church the church that have a host so for complete redemption you cannot receive it under baptism not on the methodist you must look for a church that has a host [Applause] hallelujah and gave the man two persons and told him if he needed more i will pay him when i come and he got two pences he's able to do what i thought the doctor was him the son of righteousness shall rise with healing with healing everybody here if he is the man of god that stand on god's word he's got what god give him the what and the water the anointed world there ever here how is what we are to worship in water and in water ever here so they gave him two passes but to the host they also gave him another power they said there is another money that is not revealed the first money is the spirit in the world but there is another money it still belongs to the master but that money must be revealed by the host the host is the one that take the two pences but he can pull out the money out of the two pencils are the revelation from the bible that if you look like this you cannot see it in the bible it's the horse that must reveal that revelation to you [Applause] everybody everybody okay because brother problem said money represented faith it is the precious power so there is another faith that must be revealed by the host and that faith is what you need for the coming of the good samaritan it is the rapturing faith that you need to meet the coming of the good samaritan into the air let's stand we gotta stop [Applause] since the opening of the seals the baba became a new water it is loaded i advise you as a pastor go home sit down play this over everybody okay everybody here i know some of them were passing you and you can't get it the whole church age that start from jerusalem drifting down like this attack by the horses but god have a restoration that's why i will restore not looter not wesley because luther was a priest luther was a catholic priest the priest can bring full restoration you need to find the host and the host that has been given the word and the spirit to restore you amen and we are host and the host under our messenger using the same prescription that the messenger come to doctor you and to continue the ministry of the priest oh my god oh my god brother what i'm saying first we will ask you to be
