[46:30] God's grace, he opened up away, took a
[46:33] flight, and he's right here to be a
[46:35] blessing for us. I told him he's home.
[46:37] He's going to preach like home. And
[46:38] we're going to pull like home. So,
[46:40] brother Wayne, you have your liberty.

[48:00] all right with just going on with the
[48:02] worship and it would have been worth the
[48:04] journey, brother. And amen, we just uh
[48:07] so happy to be here tonight. And I thank
[48:09] our brother for the invitation to come.
[48:11] And amen, you you all are very dear in
[48:14] our hearts. And so when uh when your
[48:16] pastor called and said, "Hey, can you

[48:20] little place. And thank God for
[48:21] airplanes, you know, you can uh they got

[48:34] amen, we just want to bring you
[48:35] greetings from the home church and true
[48:37] word tabernacle there. And amen, we're
[48:39] going to have to get brother Stephen to
[48:40] come up and and just bring everybody
[48:43] that wants to come and and uh we'd love
[48:45] to come up and have a fellowship. And
[48:47] amen, what a what a blessing. And uh we
[48:49] so thank you all for the for the time to

[48:53] the blessings. And amen, we just um
[48:56] praying along the way and and praying
[48:58] the Lord would just give us something.
[49:00] uh we uh just want to maybe speak to you
[49:02] a little bit tonight, but just before we
[49:04] go to the Lord, let maybe just bow our
[49:06] hearts in a word of prayer and let's
[49:07] just speak to him and ask him to come on
[49:10] the scene and take over in this part of
[49:12] the service. Father, we bow our hearts
[49:14] tonight and we thank you, God. What a
[49:17] wonderful time and fellowship around
[49:19] your wonderful songs and the great gifts
[49:22] that you have put in this bride body,
[49:23] Lord. And nobody can sing like your
[49:26] people can sing, Lord. We'd so love to
[49:29] hear it, Lord, when when hearts are and
[49:31] full of joy and revelation comes forth,
[49:34] Lord. And Lord, I I I thank you for the
[49:37] gifts that you've given. And Lord, we
[49:40] ask you tonight that you would help us,
[49:42] Father, as we would before your children
[49:44] make known, Lord, of of the inabilities
[49:48] of a human being. And Lord, how we
[49:50] realize our littleness, Father, how we
[49:53] see our inabilities to help anyone,
[49:55] Lord. But Father, we're solely counting
[49:58] on you tonight that you would take your
[50:00] word, Lord, and you would speak
[50:02] something to your children, Father. That
[50:04] your elect, Lord, those which you had
[50:06] forthought of that you would take
[50:08] something tonight from the word and you
[50:11] would ignite faith in their heart. And
[50:13] Lord, that you would use our voice, but
[50:16] Father, may the inspiration be from you.
[50:18] We ask that you would strengthen them,
[50:20] build them, Lord. Father, prepare them
[50:23] for that translation hour, Lord, and you
[50:25] would secure them in your faith and
[50:27] Lord, anoint them, Lord, for the
[50:29] journey. And Lord, we're asking you
[50:31] tonight, even if one would be sick among
[50:32] us, Lord, as we speak your word, may
[50:35] Father, it be as the Bible said that you
[50:37] sent your word and you healed the
[50:40] people. We ask you, Father, tonight that
[50:42] you would do these things in the mighty
[50:44] and wonderful name of Jesus Christ. We
[50:46] pray. Amen. And amen. And God bless you
[50:50] tonight. If you have your Bibles, we
[50:52] would just like to go to the word of the
[50:53] Lord. We'll go to the book of Hebrews.
[50:55] And I would like to look in Hebrews
[50:57] chapter 12 and verse 24. Hallelujah.
[51:09] It's a beautiful scripture here. Amen.
[51:11] Amen. Uh we have done an extensive
[51:14] amount of study in this particular
[51:16] scripture and have taken uh several uh
[51:19] several thoughts from it. But tonight I
[51:21] want to uh look at it uh just for our
[51:25] our scripture for the basis of our
[51:26] thought
[51:27] tonight. And to Jesus the
[51:30] mediator of the new covenant, right? And
[51:34] to the blood of sprinkling. Uhhuh.
[51:37] that
[51:38] speaketh better things than that of
[51:42] Abel. That's right. That speaketh better
[51:45] things than that of Abel. May God bless
[51:48] his word tonight. As you could be
[51:49] seated, I want to speak to you a little
[51:51] bit tonight. And if I would take a
[51:53] title, I want to title this the
[51:55] influence of King
[51:58] Theophony. The influence of King
[52:01] Theophony. Amen. I I certainly believe
[52:04] you're influenced. Don't you?
[52:06] Everybody's influenced by something.
[52:08] Amen. But uh but I want to speak to you
[52:11] about the influence of our King
[52:13] Theophony. I love how Brother Brandham
[52:14] says things and sometimes he just says
[52:17] things so wonderfully simple that they
[52:19] they're so powerfully profound. Amen.
[52:21] And and uh in the in the token message,
[52:24] Brother Brandham says, you know, you see
[52:26] the blood speaks better things than that
[52:29] of Abel. And he said, you said the blood
[52:31] speaks. He said, oh, absolutely. The
[52:33] blood speaks. If you're back there in
[52:35] the book of Genesis, you find out that
[52:37] the bud spilled back in Genesis chapter
[52:39] 4. And then we find out again in Hebrews
[52:42] 12 that the blood of the covenant of
[52:44] Christ speaks better than that of Abel.
[52:47] We find out the blood does speak. See,
[52:49] it speaks on your behalf. The life
[52:52] that's in you speaks from the shed
[52:56] blood. Oh, brother, I wished everybody
[52:58] could see that. Now, if you could see
[53:00] what it is, it's the life that is in
[53:03] you. If you can see what it is, it's the
[53:06] life that is in you. See, the blood is
[53:10] identifying you with it. See, it's the
[53:12] token. See, the blood was shed for you.
[53:15] You've accepted the life has come into
[53:18] you, and you have the token. That is the
[53:20] Holy Spirit. See, the blood speaketh
[53:23] better things than that of Abel. And and
[53:25] just in going back there with Cain and
[53:28] Abel, you remember when he slew his
[53:30] brother's blood and the blood laid on
[53:31] the ground, you couldn't deny that there
[53:34] was blood on the ground. And that blood
[53:36] itself was the testament that something
[53:39] had died. Amen. Abel's blood on the
[53:42] ground could not let Cain escape.
[53:45] Something has died here. And the blood
[53:48] spoke of itself and said, "There's been
[53:50] a death here." But the blood of Abel
[53:53] spoke of of of of something needing to
[53:56] be avenged. It spoke of something that
[53:58] had died and there was no way to get
[53:59] away from that. But yet tonight, because
[54:02] we have the Holy Ghost, amen, the token
[54:05] of the blood is the life that's in the
[54:07] blood. So tonight, because you have the
[54:09] Holy Ghost, Amen. It speaks definitely
[54:12] that there has been a death, a burial,
[54:15] and a resurrection. So, by you having
[54:18] the Holy Ghost tonight, it speaks
[54:19] itself, but it speaks of redemption. It
[54:22] speaks of power. It speaks of of the
[54:25] grace of God that's in your life. And
[54:27] and it actually speaks of I love how
[54:29] Brother Bam says it. It speaks of an
[54:31] abstract or a clearing of the title in
[54:34] in the rise of the sun. Brother Bam said
[54:36] this this Pentecostal experience today
[54:38] and the coming of the Holy Ghost in the
[54:40] last days, he says, see, it's an
[54:42] abstract to a title deed. I love it.
[54:45] Amen. how how simple he puts it. He
[54:48] says, "See, you can get a title to a
[54:50] place and you but that don't say it's
[54:52] yours." Now, somebody way back there
[54:54] could say and come and put a claim on
[54:57] it. See, but when you got an abstract,
[54:59] that shows that everything that's struck
[55:01] ever against it is struck off, plumb
[55:04] back to the foundation. Now, is that
[55:06] right? And when a man says he believes
[55:08] the word, then the Holy Spirit comes.
[55:11] See, it's an abstract to the title. And
[55:14] that gives us permission when you have
[55:17] an abstract that every bit of that
[55:20] belongs to you and everything is is on
[55:23] it belongs to you. Amen. And that gives
[55:26] us an abstract when the Holy Ghost comes
[55:28] upon this title deed that God saw you
[55:32] back there before the foundation of the
[55:34] world and put your name on the lamb's
[55:36] book of life. See, but was born through
[55:39] a man or a woman. See, and then you were
[55:42] back there before them. But because you
[55:44] were born through a man or a woman, see,
[55:47] and then you become subject to sin and
[55:49] guilty of sin. But when I believed on
[55:52] it, I received a deed. He said, but when
[55:55] the Holy Ghost come, it was the abstract
[55:58] that everything against me, he says,
[56:01] whether it was my mother done it,
[56:03] whether it was my father done it,
[56:04] whether it was my grandmother done it.
[56:06] See, then it's stricken off of me. the
[56:09] abstract. See, it shows that everything
[56:11] that is against it is gone. I I love
[56:14] how, brother Bam, it don't matter
[56:16] whether your father did it or your
[56:18] mother did it or anybody did it. Amen.
[56:20] Whatever it was, see, it's stricken off.
[56:22] And And to think tonight that God has a
[56:25] way to say it's stricken off. Now, that
[56:27] that life that's in that blood is the
[56:31] token. It's the thing that speaks. And
[56:33] and I'll say it to you like this. It's
[56:35] deity speaking. It's it's not just uh
[56:38] it's not just a I'm a I'm a church
[56:40] membership. It it's not you saying well
[56:42] I belong to a certain church or well I
[56:44] believe this doctrine or I I think this.
[56:47] But the abstract of the token life of
[56:50] Jesus Christ is that he himself is
[56:53] testifying in you that it has been
[56:56] cleared off and there is no claims
[56:58] against your life that you belong to
[57:01] God. I love how brother Bam says it's an
[57:03] Easter because we have risen with him.
[57:06] Not that we're going to rise. We have
[57:08] already risen. Amen. Not that we're not
[57:11] going to we're not going to get saved
[57:13] and going to escape. We have already
[57:15] escaped. We have already been delivered.
[57:18] We have already been resurrected. Amen.
[57:20] I'm not trying to be amen poetic. This
[57:23] is doctrinal sound truth that the man
[57:26] that is in Christ has already ceased
[57:29] from his own labors. There is now no
[57:31] more condemnation in them. There is no
[57:34] more damnatory sentence under their
[57:36] lives. They have been saved, sanctified,
[57:39] filled with the Holy Ghost and they are
[57:41] sealed until the day of redemption and
[57:43] there's no devils. There's no pout.
[57:46] There is nothing that can break it
[57:48] because the blood is speaking over that
[57:51] life. The blood is saying they're
[57:54] already sealed. They're already saved.
[57:59] Now, somebody said, "Well, Brother
[58:00] Wayne, I hope I make it." it. Brother
[58:01] man said, "Don't say that." I'm going to
[58:04] quote him directly. Don't you say, "I
[58:06] hope I make it." You already made it.
[58:10] Let the blood speak for you. Amen. Not
[58:12] what I'm saying myself. What the blood
[58:15] has said for me. Amen. You remember
[58:19] years ago, I don't know if y'all
[58:20] remember, but when I was a younger man,
[58:22] I remember the kids, they got in a habit
[58:24] where somebody says something they
[58:25] didn't like, and they'd say, "Speak to
[58:26] the hand because the ear ain't
[58:28] listening." Y'all remember that? Speak
[58:29] to the hand cuz the ear ain't listening.
[58:31] Well, listen. Let me tell you this.
[58:32] Speak to the blood. I tell you what you
[58:34] do. You tell that devil. If he has
[58:36] something, you say, "Speak to the
[58:38] blood." Because I ain't listening no
[58:40] more. I do not have to explain myself to
[58:42] the devil. I don't have to talk to the
[58:45] devil and reason with him about
[58:47] situations. Amen. Because the blood has
[58:50] already spoken for me. Therefore, amen,
[58:53] the prophet said, "You don't say, "Well,
[58:56] I hope I make it." You already made it.
[58:59] Not I will make it. I have already made
[59:01] it. Amen. Oh my goodness. Amen. Not that
[59:04] I made it. He made it for me. That's
[59:07] right. Amen. How can you do it? See, you
[59:10] say, "Well, I can call him down."
[59:11] Brother Bam said, "No, he's already in
[59:13] you. You just got to get yourself out of
[59:16] the way so he can manifest." You see
[59:19] that Jesus Christ is here in this
[59:21] building right now. He's already in you.
[59:24] And if God is in you, all power is in
[59:27] you. Don't you tell me there's a weak
[59:29] spot in God because he's omnipotent, is
[59:32] he not? He is all powerful. You know
[59:34] that's the Bible. All power, Amen, is
[59:37] given unto me. And then the Jesus, that
[59:39] same one that said that said, "Yet a
[59:41] little while and the world see me no
[59:43] more, but you shall see me for I will be
[59:45] with you even in you until the end of
[59:47] the age of that same Jesus that created
[59:50] the heavens and the earth is inside the
[59:53] believer tonight. You don't have to call
[59:55] him down. You got to surrender to what's
[59:58] on the inside of you. Come on. I I want
[1:00:01] you to know it's real. I want you to
[1:00:03] know it's real. Somebody said, "Well,
[1:00:04] Brother Wayne, there's trouble
[1:00:05] everywhere. I don't know if we got what
[1:00:07] it takes." Brother Brandon said it like
[1:00:09] this. There was a storm that night, but
[1:00:11] the master was already in the ship.
[1:00:15] He might have been sleeping, but he was
[1:00:17] there. He said, "All Peter had to do was
[1:00:19] wake him up. They was as secure in that
[1:00:22] ship as they would ever be because the
[1:00:25] master was in there. This ain't a boat
[1:00:28] tonight. This is a mud ship, a dirt
[1:00:30] ship. But that same Jesus is on the
[1:00:32] inside. If you would just wake him up
[1:00:35] tonight and say,
[1:00:37] "Master, that same one is here and he
[1:00:40] still
[1:00:41] speaks. He still speaks. The blood is
[1:00:45] still speaking." You see, God has been
[1:00:48] collecting evidence.
[1:00:50] Do y'all know Brother Brandham collected
[1:00:51] evidence? Brother Brandham collected
[1:00:53] evidence and he told us this. He said,
[1:00:56] "With all this evidence collected," I
[1:00:59] love that. Don't you? With all the
[1:01:00] evidence. So, so the devil might have
[1:01:02] been collecting evidence, but God's been
[1:01:04] collecting
[1:01:05] evidence. The devil might have been
[1:01:07] collecting evidence of your natural
[1:01:09] life, but God has been collecting
[1:01:11] evidence of your spiritual life. Amen.
[1:01:14] And when this prophet came, he did not
[1:01:16] come to talk to you about your family
[1:01:19] life. He came to talk to you about your
[1:01:21] atmosphere, of your heavenly life, of
[1:01:24] who you were in him before the
[1:01:26] foundation of the world. You know your
[1:01:28] family genetics. What you didn't know is
[1:01:30] your God genetics, but God sent a
[1:01:33] prophet to reveal that part. Your
[1:01:36] spiritual DNA has come alive in this age
[1:01:39] and identified you.
[1:01:42] Oh, I
[1:01:43] didn't you know, brother brother, I
[1:01:46] thought I was American Indian for years.
[1:01:48] You know, me and Daryl Ward, I thought I
[1:01:50] was right with brother Daryl. You know,
[1:01:51] I was American Indian and Amen. My mom
[1:01:53] told me that and my uncles told me that
[1:01:56] and I I was supposed to have a great
[1:01:57] grandmother that was a full-blooded
[1:01:59] Cherokee named Whitehead. So, I my whole
[1:02:01] life I I people say, "Well, why you got
[1:02:03] a little dark skin there?" You know, I
[1:02:05] said, "Well, I I'm a Native American.
[1:02:06] You know, I got I got high Cherokee
[1:02:08] blood in me." And and I identified that
[1:02:10] way for years. And then finally DNA come
[1:02:12] out. And so I wanted to find out, you
[1:02:15] know, maybe I'm I might have some close
[1:02:16] kin folks in the Cherokee Nation. So I
[1:02:19] come back. You know what? I'm paleface
[1:02:21] all together. Amen. I I'm English and
[1:02:24] I'm Scottish and I'm Welch and I'm Amen.
[1:02:26] I I had a crisis
[1:02:29] identity and I found out that I had
[1:02:31] cousins living right close to me. So I
[1:02:34] contacted them in Ohio. I'm from the
[1:02:36] South. So I contact them Ohio. Well,
[1:02:38] they didn't know they we were cousins.
[1:02:40] They they had no clue how I got in the
[1:02:42] cousin line. Well, I I hate to admit it,
[1:02:44] but the lady finally got to checking it
[1:02:46] out. And her her
[1:02:48] grandmother had not lived so true.
[1:02:51] So, the family ties were there. They
[1:02:53] just didn't know they were there. So, it
[1:02:55] started in a negative way.
[1:02:58] But you see, when this message came
[1:03:02] and started picking up my DNA, he said I
[1:03:05] was kin to Adam and I was kin to Moses
[1:03:08] and I was kin to Joshua and I was kin to
[1:03:10] William Brown. I didn't even know there
[1:03:12] were family ties. But come to find out,
[1:03:16] we have the same
[1:03:18] father. You and I are brothers. You and
[1:03:22] I are brother and sister. We got the
[1:03:23] same daddy. But it's through a spiritual
[1:03:26] DNA that made us genetically the same.
[1:03:30] You want to talk to me about my family
[1:03:32] line. Amen. Let me talk to you about my
[1:03:34] my my brothers like
[1:03:37] Joshua. Let me talk to you about my
[1:03:39] brothers like Moses. And Amen. What
[1:03:41] about David that killed lions? And you
[1:03:44] talk about a reputation. I come from a
[1:03:47] family line. Amen. Where Jesus is our
[1:03:49] elder brother.
[1:03:51] Hey, he's the
[1:03:55] Let's collect some evidence. What do you
[1:03:57] think?
[1:03:59] And it's DNA evidence.
[1:04:02] Every everything else is is dismissal.
[1:04:05] You you can dismiss almost all the
[1:04:07] evidence they can get. If you can get
[1:04:08] DNA proof,
[1:04:11] DNA is the absolute of evidence.
[1:04:14] Is that right? And they can they these
[1:04:17] people been on uh they've been on death
[1:04:20] row for years and they get DNA evidence
[1:04:22] come find out they wasn't even guilty to
[1:04:24] start with. So all the other evidence
[1:04:28] was dismissed in the face of DNA
[1:04:31] evidence. I'm talking to you. Amen. You
[1:04:34] see Amen. Brother Brandham says that
[1:04:37] that we had a case against us. He said
[1:04:40] but our judge became our
[1:04:42] lawyer. And he said, "You see a positive
[1:04:45] case because our lawyer said the case is
[1:04:48] dismissed against us." Amen. The blood
[1:04:52] has spoke for us to dismiss all evidence
[1:04:56] against us. And somebody said, "Well, I
[1:04:58] saw him do this and I think he did that
[1:05:00] and I thought he did this." But the DNA
[1:05:03] evidence, it dismisses all other
[1:05:07] evidence because you never did it in the
[1:05:10] first place. You never even were there
[1:05:14] in the first place. And according to
[1:05:16] God's records, the blood has spoke and
[1:05:19] dismissed everything the devil has
[1:05:22] against you. So devil, I'm coming to
[1:05:25] take back everything you took from me
[1:05:28] because you don't belong. There's
[1:05:30] nothing you got. There's nothing you got
[1:05:33] that you actually have rights
[1:05:36] to. Church of the living God, we don't
[1:05:38] have to lay down to the devil.
[1:05:41] Come on. He's using condemnation where
[1:05:44] he's exposing your weaknesses and
[1:05:46] exploiting you because of your
[1:05:48] weaknesses. But if you would just get in
[1:05:50] God tonight and identify yourself in
[1:05:52] God, you know who you were from before
[1:05:54] the world began. And you say, "Satan,
[1:05:57] there is no weak spot in the children of
[1:06:02] God. This ain't a game of
[1:06:05] politics." Come on. The devil don't have
[1:06:07] no he don't have no political male on
[1:06:10] you where he can he going to show up
[1:06:12] later and say well you you know how it
[1:06:14] goes. I mean you know if you going to
[1:06:16] stand up well you did this and you did
[1:06:17] this and you but do you see God's
[1:06:19] different than that because God destroys
[1:06:22] the evidence before he tells you to take
[1:06:24] a stand.
[1:06:27] Take your stand. But but see God has
[1:06:30] already protected you that you can take
[1:06:32] a stand.
[1:06:34] The case is dismissed. Amen. And brother
[1:06:36] Bam said, "See, the life is in the Holy
[1:06:39] Ghost.
[1:06:40] The life is in the spirit." See, now
[1:06:43] y'all know y'all know the chemical of
[1:06:45] the blood that people preach about the
[1:06:47] blood and and and and people say to me,
[1:06:49] "Brother Wayne, you you don't preach
[1:06:51] about the blood enough." And I thought,
[1:06:52] "My goodness, what the what are you
[1:06:54] talking about?" No, I I'm not a
[1:06:57] historian talking about the the the the
[1:07:00] chemical that struck the ground. And
[1:07:02] come on, church. That's 2,000 years old.
[1:07:05] That blood dried up and it disappeared
[1:07:08] years ago.
[1:07:10] But the life that was in that blood has
[1:07:14] appeared in the last days to show it's
[1:07:17] the same yesterday, today, and it's just
[1:07:19] as fresh as it ever was.
[1:07:23] Right here, tonight. Yeah, we speak
[1:07:25] about the blood, but we're speaking
[1:07:27] about the blood not in a historical
[1:07:29] term. Not the blood in tradition, not
[1:07:32] the blood in church, but the life of the
[1:07:35] blood in the church of the living God.
[1:07:38] Deity is not in the heavens. Deity is in
[1:07:44] you. Come on church. All that was in God
[1:07:48] was poured into Christ. And all that was
[1:07:50] in Christ is poured into you. It was the
[1:07:53] father was above us. He became a part of
[1:07:56] us in Jesus. But
[1:07:58] tonight, but tonight by the way of the
[1:08:01] Holy Ghost, he is in you.
[1:08:07] Oh my goodness. Yes, there's a voice.
[1:08:10] Yes, there's a life. And the voice of
[1:08:13] that blood is the word.
[1:08:17] That word. Hallelujah. The voice of that
[1:08:20] blood is the Holy Ghost. Come on. Then
[1:08:23] the word and the Holy Ghost are not two
[1:08:25] different things.
[1:08:27] Hallelujah. Isn't it powerful when you
[1:08:30] see that in the beginning was the word
[1:08:32] and the word was with God and the word
[1:08:35] became flesh. And what was flesh in that
[1:08:38] day by the sun is flesh tonight by the
[1:08:42] bride.
[1:08:45] The word made flesh becomes the light of
[1:08:48] the age
[1:08:50] when you see it.
[1:08:53] Oh, I see it. I see Joel 2. I see Luke
[1:08:57] 17. I see Revelations 10. Come on. This
[1:09:01] is not a historic lesson. This is not
[1:09:03] just looking back in the 60s and seeing
[1:09:05] what was with a prophet. Come on,
[1:09:07] church. You got to update the revelation
[1:09:09] and know what he preached back there is
[1:09:11] right here tonight. It's alive. Come on.
[1:09:15] Jesus is alive. But he's not just alive.
[1:09:19] His church is alive. He said, "Because I
[1:09:22] live, ye live also." Hallelujah. We are
[1:09:26] alive tonight by the power of the
[1:09:29] resurrection of Jesus Christ. You're not
[1:09:32] just a homo sapiion tonight. You're not
[1:09:35] just a human being. You're a son of
[1:09:38] almighty God.
[1:09:40] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:09:43] [Music]
[1:09:45] My Tell that devil, get on out of here,
[1:09:48] devil. Amen. Amen. I know who I am.
[1:09:52] I have evidence.
[1:09:55] We have collected evidence.
[1:10:01] The New Testament, Brother Brandham said
[1:10:04] it's the blood. And the New Testament,
[1:10:06] it speaks of redemption.
[1:10:09] [Applause]
[1:10:10] Future home. Brother Brandham says,
[1:10:12] "What is a redeemer?" He said, "A
[1:10:14] redeemer." He says, "My goodness, it's a
[1:10:16] redeemer." See, he came to re Why did
[1:10:19] Christ come?
[1:10:21] He came to redeem.
[1:10:23] From the book of Luke, the nth chapter,
[1:10:25] the Bible said, "For the son of man came
[1:10:27] to seek
[1:10:29] that which was lost." Come on now. You
[1:10:33] had to be somewhere before you can be
[1:10:35] lost.
[1:10:37] You got to belong to somebody before you
[1:10:39] can be lost. Something you had to be
[1:10:42] somewhere sometime that you were in the
[1:10:44] hands of somebody before you can be
[1:10:47] lost. And the same God that had you in
[1:10:50] him before the world began said, "You
[1:10:53] was lost, but I've come to the earth to
[1:10:55] save."
[1:10:58] To seek out and to save
[1:11:01] that which was lost.
[1:11:06] Come on now. Brother Bam says, "See,
[1:11:08] it's a fall. It we we we he came to
[1:11:10] redeem that which was fallen." Now, why
[1:11:13] didn't he get them praised? Uhhuh. When
[1:11:16] Jesus came, why didn't he get those
[1:11:18] priests? Why? He was a redeemer, was he
[1:11:20] not? You can't tell me he didn't have
[1:11:23] the power to to redeem anything.
[1:11:25] [Music]
[1:11:27] See, see, it wasn't a lack of his power
[1:11:30] to get them. It was simply they wasn't
[1:11:33] there to begin with.
[1:11:36] Do you see how you diminish the power of
[1:11:38] God when you think, "Oh, because that
[1:11:41] person turned him down." Then God don't
[1:11:43] have the power.
[1:11:46] Come on. They just wasn't there to begin
[1:11:49] with. But if you were there to begin
[1:11:51] with,
[1:11:55] I don't care what comes. If your name
[1:11:58] was in that lamb's book of life before
[1:12:00] the foundation of the world, God will
[1:12:03] move heaven and earth to get to a child
[1:12:06] of God. If your name is in that lamb's
[1:12:09] book of life, I say you ought to just
[1:12:11] surrender tonight and let the rapturing
[1:12:13] power of the Holy Ghost get a hold of
[1:12:15] you.
[1:12:19] Oh, hallelujah. He came to redeem that
[1:12:21] which was fallen in the fall. This got
[1:12:24] all messed up with that girl. But God
[1:12:28] had her in his thinking. Amen. Before
[1:12:31] the foundation
[1:12:33] and he come to cleanse her. See, she had
[1:12:37] eternal life. He come to cleanse her.
[1:12:40] Third seal, Brother Bram said, you you
[1:12:42] see what it was? It was the light struck
[1:12:45] the seed.
[1:12:46] That's what it was. He said it had been
[1:12:49] laying there.
[1:12:51] That was spoke by God.
[1:12:54] My goodness. Do you know how your name
[1:12:56] is in the Lamb's book of life? Come on
[1:12:58] now. He don't He don't have a little
[1:13:00] book up there that he
[1:13:02] Come on. We the Bible speaks of these
[1:13:05] things to make them relative to the
[1:13:06] humanity. But the prophet of God said
[1:13:09] when God put Jesus's name, he put your
[1:13:11] name there.
[1:13:13] He said, and let me just put it a little
[1:13:15] bit better. He said when he put it there
[1:13:17] by the spoken word,
[1:13:20] that's the reason it takes the spoken
[1:13:22] word to call the name.
[1:13:25] It'll take a prophet to call the name.
[1:13:28] Come on. No Baptist can call the name.
[1:13:31] Come on. No Lutheran can call your name.
[1:13:33] Amen. Because it wasn't written like
[1:13:35] that. It was written by the word of God,
[1:13:39] the spoken word of God. And you're a
[1:13:42] part of that word.
[1:13:44] And that light struck that seed that was
[1:13:46] spoke by God.
[1:13:49] Now, that seed was on the earth. Yes,
[1:13:51] sir. And God just moved the water away
[1:13:53] and the sun hit it and it come up.
[1:13:56] That's all it needed was just the sun.
[1:13:58] That just needed light. Now, now,
[1:14:01] Brother Brandham, immediately, you know
[1:14:02] what he's talking about. He's talking
[1:14:03] about the beginning of creation when
[1:14:05] God, cuz somebody said, "Brother
[1:14:06] Brandom, I don't believe God created the
[1:14:08] earth 6,000 years. That we we can prove
[1:14:10] it's a million years old." He said,
[1:14:11] "Well, you're missing Genesis 1 and1."
[1:14:13] For in the beginning, God created
[1:14:14] heavens and earth. Period. How long is
[1:14:16] that period?
[1:14:19] Now, now, now that's what you got to
[1:14:20] watch in the Bible. Pronunciation
[1:14:23] can be a a period of time.
[1:14:26] So, so if it if it just has a period,
[1:14:29] that could be a million years before the
[1:14:31] next words.
[1:14:34] Yes, sir. Watch Genesis and watch him.
[1:14:37] He says, "And he created the heavens,
[1:14:38] earth, total, and multiply and
[1:14:39] replenish." Amen. And subdue the earth.
[1:14:41] Now, there's the millennium.
[1:14:44] Watch the skip. It's called a spaceime.
[1:14:47] It's a It's a time that's that's not
[1:14:49] spoken of, but put in pronunciations or
[1:14:52] periods.
[1:14:56] But but it takes revelation to catch the
[1:14:59] understanding.
[1:15:01] Right. And and and the prophet said,
[1:15:03] "Watch him." He put every one of them
[1:15:05] seeds. And I'm in the fourth seal now.
[1:15:06] You know where I'm at. And the four
[1:15:08] seal, he said they were there from a
[1:15:09] previous civilization.
[1:15:12] Now, we can go on any kind of tangent. I
[1:15:14] don't know about that, but I think he
[1:15:15] had a previous civilization in his mind.
[1:15:18] That's where I think it was. I I just
[1:15:20] Amen. But in that civilization, he spoke
[1:15:23] them things. And when the world was
[1:15:25] created, every seed of every plant life
[1:15:28] was already there. So all he had to do
[1:15:31] is say, "Let there be light."
[1:15:33] And when the light begin to move, the
[1:15:35] water rolled back and the light struck
[1:15:37] the seed.
[1:15:39] Now, why didn't the palm tree become a
[1:15:41] cedar tree?
[1:15:44] Come on. Why didn't Why didn't it Why
[1:15:46] didn't the dirt rise up? Because it
[1:15:48] wasn't the seed of it. Amen. So the sun
[1:15:51] only judged the seed to make it give
[1:15:54] forth what it already was. Do you see?
[1:15:57] And when that light struck her, brother
[1:15:59] Bam said the Holy Spirit, see moved away
[1:16:02] her past life and showed it to her.
[1:16:06] That light struck it. Now you know good
[1:16:09] and well them Pharisees had much better
[1:16:11] to look at. But on the inside there was
[1:16:14] a previous civilization. She come from
[1:16:16] the mind of God.
[1:16:21] Brother Bam said she knew it. Because
[1:16:22] the light struck it.
[1:16:25] That's why. Because the light struck it.
[1:16:28] Now watch. Brother Bam, he'll help you
[1:16:29] in the third seal. He helped you really
[1:16:31] catch it. He says, "Here it is." He
[1:16:33] said, he said, he walked right up and he
[1:16:34] said, "Your name is Simon and your
[1:16:36] father's name is Jonas." He said that
[1:16:38] deflated him. He said because it that
[1:16:41] little eternal life seed struck in
[1:16:44] there. Amen. That little eternal life
[1:16:49] seed. Now, that is the difference of
[1:16:51] where you fit in God. That little
[1:16:54] eternal life seat. Listen, if that
[1:16:56] little eternal life seed is on the
[1:16:58] inside of you tonight, I want you to
[1:17:00] know something. I want you to know
[1:17:02] there's not enough hell, there's not
[1:17:04] enough devils, there's not enough
[1:17:06] religion, there's not enough sin,
[1:17:08] there's not enough demons, there is
[1:17:10] nothing.
[1:17:12] There is nothing that can keep that
[1:17:15] child of God from returning back to the
[1:17:20] father. You said, "Brother Wayne, how do
[1:17:22] I know if that eternal life seeds on the
[1:17:24] inside of me?" The blood speaks. The
[1:17:27] blood says it's there.
[1:17:29] Why do you think God sent the message?
[1:17:34] He come to send the message to save that
[1:17:36] which was
[1:17:39] Somebody said, "Well, I don't know if
[1:17:41] I'm I'm metal or I'm aluminum." Well,
[1:17:44] put the magnet over it.
[1:17:49] Put the magnet over it. You say, "I'm a
[1:17:52] little dirty." It don't matter if it's
[1:17:54] dirty or not. Is it aluminum or is it
[1:17:56] metal?
[1:17:58] The magnet does the judging.
[1:18:02] The message is what judges us. Are you
[1:18:05] seed?
[1:18:07] Yeah, I'm seed because the blood says
[1:18:10] I'm seed. The message says I'm
[1:18:16] seen. So, preacher, what are you doing?
[1:18:18] There's faith for healing, but there's
[1:18:19] faith for rapture. And faith for rapture
[1:18:22] comes out of the reality of knowing who
[1:18:25] you
[1:18:26] are. Everybody said, "Brother Lane, we
[1:18:29] want rapture and faith." You know what
[1:18:30] brother Ram said? He said, "When this
[1:18:31] bride recognizes
[1:18:33] who she is, this rapture is going to go,
[1:18:38] then rapturing revelation lies in your
[1:18:42] position in God. And there is no other
[1:18:45] message could tell you where you
[1:18:47] belonged before the world began.
[1:18:52] Nobody can do an abstract on you like
[1:18:54] that."
[1:18:55] [Applause]
[1:18:59] Invisible union. Brother Bama, say it.
[1:19:01] You were sons and daughters of God
[1:19:02] before there was a sun, a moon, stars,
[1:19:04] or a molecule. That's right. You were
[1:19:06] the sons and daughters of God. You are
[1:19:08] only the physical manifestation
[1:19:12] of the attributes that was in God at the
[1:19:15] beginning.
[1:19:17] Now it it I'm I'm going to I'm going to
[1:19:19] just give you a little word here and
[1:19:20] this will maybe as you read the message
[1:19:22] throughout the years. I want you to
[1:19:23] remember this attribute is son.
[1:19:29] So somebody said we don't we don't know
[1:19:31] about manifested sons yet. We don't know
[1:19:33] if it's the time of manifested sons. We
[1:19:36] just use the word attribute and see how
[1:19:37] many times brother Bam said it's the
[1:19:39] manifested attribute.
[1:19:41] See an attribute is the attributes of
[1:19:44] God. It's the son. See, that was in him
[1:19:46] at the beginning. Now, there's only one
[1:19:47] form of eternal life. How many agrees
[1:19:49] with that? Brother Brandham taught that
[1:19:51] to teach you there's no eternal hell,
[1:19:53] didn't he? He said, see, if if if Satan
[1:19:55] had a beginning, he's got an end. I was
[1:19:59] just listening to the four seal this
[1:20:00] morning. Brother Brandham said, then
[1:20:01] that shows us what we believe about the
[1:20:03] devil. We believe he will have complete
[1:20:07] annihilation.
[1:20:10] We believe Satan will be completely
[1:20:13] annihilated.
[1:20:14] Oh, the devil hates that. But hell was
[1:20:17] created not for children of God. It was
[1:20:21] for the devil and his angels.
[1:20:25] Sons and daughters of God have eternal
[1:20:27] life.
[1:20:29] [Music]
[1:20:30] [Applause]
[1:20:32] There's only one form of eternal life.
[1:20:34] And you know what brother Bam said? Yes
[1:20:35] sir. And every quote nearly he says and
[1:20:38] that was God. But in invisible union he
[1:20:40] says but that was you.
[1:20:43] [Applause]
[1:20:45] I want you to choke it down. Chew it up.
[1:20:48] Amen. And keep it down. I know. I know.
[1:20:52] I know. And I know you're not
[1:20:53] Pentecostal, but but some people get
[1:20:55] Pentecostal indigestion.
[1:20:57] [Applause]
[1:20:58] [Music]
[1:21:01] They just can't swallow the reality of
[1:21:04] predestination.
[1:21:06] Come on. They want to choke it back up.
[1:21:08] But I love how Brother Bram said, "We
[1:21:09] eat them beans and and that onion." He
[1:21:11] said, "It started coming back up." He
[1:21:13] pushed it back down. Said, "I can. I
[1:21:15] will. I do believe." And if there's
[1:21:17] something wrong with your digestive
[1:21:18] system, go ahead and eat the message.
[1:21:21] And if it wants to come back up because
[1:21:22] your belly is a little bitter, come on,
[1:21:25] put it back down and say, "I can. And I
[1:21:28] will and I do believe. I believe I'm a
[1:21:32] son of God. I believe I'm a daughter of
[1:21:34] God." I think you ought to take the book
[1:21:36] of redemption and beat every devil back
[1:21:39] into hell unto the authority of this
[1:21:42] word.
[1:21:44] You want to get what belongs to you? Get
[1:21:47] a revelation of who you are.
[1:21:50] It don't belong to me because of my good
[1:21:52] works. It belongs to me because of who
[1:21:55] my daddy is.
[1:21:58] I know who he is.
[1:22:02] I know where I belong.
[1:22:06] You was in God before the foundation of
[1:22:08] the world. And there's only one form of
[1:22:10] eternal life. And you don't know nothing
[1:22:13] about it. And neither did you know when
[1:22:16] you was in your earthly father. Now look
[1:22:18] how brother Bam does that. He just
[1:22:20] sideswiped you cuz you say, "I don't
[1:22:23] remember it, so it mustn't be." He said,
[1:22:24] "And neither did you remember being in
[1:22:27] your earthly father either."
[1:22:30] Look how look how simple a prophet makes
[1:22:33] this. You said, "Well, I couldn't have
[1:22:35] been in God because I don't remember
[1:22:37] being in God."
[1:22:40] Now, there isn't one of you here tonight
[1:22:43] that wasn't in your father.
[1:22:45] Not Not one person sitting alive in this
[1:22:48] building just procreated off of a stump
[1:22:51] somewhere.
[1:22:53] I don't even have to see your dad. I
[1:22:56] know you were in your dad because your
[1:22:59] life speaks of a father.
[1:23:04] But you don't remember it, so it didn't
[1:23:06] happen, right? You don't remember it, so
[1:23:09] you It didn't happen. It didn't You
[1:23:11] wasn't there. And And you just uh you
[1:23:13] just one day showed up in a hospital
[1:23:15] room and said, "I'd like to be a human
[1:23:17] being."
[1:23:18] You know, they probably if if you was in
[1:23:21] a good a church, if you was in a good
[1:23:23] church hospital, they probably had a
[1:23:25] little altar there. And you know what
[1:23:26] happened to you? and you you you just
[1:23:28] come crawling in there and you crawled
[1:23:30] up to a little altar and say, "I'd like
[1:23:31] to be a child of God. I I I mean, I I'd
[1:23:34] like to be the child of my mom and
[1:23:36] daddy." And you think right there is is
[1:23:38] your existence and how you came into the
[1:23:40] earth. No, sir. No, sir. And even if you
[1:23:44] don't remember it, it didn't happen like
[1:23:45] that.
[1:23:48] No. No. Amen. There has to be a birth. I
[1:23:51] agree. There's got to be a birth. But
[1:23:54] before the birth, there has to be a
[1:23:56] seed.
[1:23:57] And a prophet of God said, "You were in
[1:24:00] God before the world began." And no
[1:24:04] different than your mama set you down.
[1:24:08] Almost every mama sitting in here can
[1:24:10] tell you my my wife's got three. She can
[1:24:13] tell you what time of day, which one
[1:24:14] come. We can tell you the atmosphere,
[1:24:17] the room, you what time of day, what
[1:24:19] happened before, what happened after.
[1:24:21] Amen. and and she actually keeps up with
[1:24:23] with world events by what stage her kid
[1:24:25] was and diapers, you know, y'all know
[1:24:27] what I'm talking about because they were
[1:24:30] doing this or this and this this must
[1:24:31] have happened the same. And she keeps up
[1:24:33] with everything by the by those children
[1:24:35] and their birth and how it was, you
[1:24:37] know, so so she can tell you a story.
[1:24:40] That's right. and and and the same as
[1:24:42] your mother and the same as your mother
[1:24:44] told you and and I I know probably
[1:24:47] you've heard these a lot of times but
[1:24:50] but the adoption of memory human memory
[1:24:54] just simply comes because you believe
[1:24:57] your mom then you sign every certificate
[1:25:01] you fill out age and you put it on there
[1:25:04] without blinking
[1:25:07] you don't even you don't you don't stop
[1:25:09] and put down the pen and run outside
[1:25:12] said, "Mom, now how old? How what what
[1:25:14] day was I born on?" No, because you
[1:25:17] identify
[1:25:19] with a memory that your mama told you
[1:25:21] because you believe it.
[1:25:25] Because you believe it. Come on, church.
[1:25:28] And I was in
[1:25:30] God and a prophet came and said, "You
[1:25:33] were born with spiritual
[1:25:35] amnesia." But I'm coming to remind you
[1:25:38] of who you were before this world ever
[1:25:42] began. You're a child, a daughter of
[1:25:45] God. Let Theophony, King Theophony,
[1:25:49] influence your
[1:25:52] memory. So when you go to pray, you
[1:25:55] don't have to run up and ask the pastor.
[1:25:56] You think it'd be all right. You think
[1:25:58] this this? No sir. You're a child. You
[1:26:00] got benefits. You got inheritance.
[1:26:03] You've got authority. You got the grace
[1:26:05] of God. You're a child of God, a son, a
[1:26:09] daughter of
[1:26:10] God. But the difference between our
[1:26:12] father and our our earthly father and
[1:26:14] our heavenly father is our heavenly
[1:26:16] father has a memory of what we were
[1:26:19] before, but he also has a memory of what
[1:26:21] we will be. So we can remember the
[1:26:24] future the same as we remember the past
[1:26:26] because the word has already told us
[1:26:29] what's going to happen.
[1:26:33] There's going to be an American pope. I
[1:26:36] remember
[1:26:37] that. I remember that when I was a
[1:26:40] little boy. There's going to be an
[1:26:42] American pope one day. There's going to
[1:26:44] be a woman in purple and she's going to
[1:26:47] rise up in this nation. I remembered as
[1:26:50] a little boy. I remember the preacher
[1:26:52] saying that and one day my memory of the
[1:26:55] future caught up with the instant. Come
[1:26:58] on, church. And the and it came
[1:27:01] together. The future and reality. Well,
[1:27:05] I remember that Russia's going to bomb
[1:27:07] the Vatican. I remember that America's
[1:27:10] going to lay in ashes. But I also
[1:27:12] remember before the first bomb ever
[1:27:14] drops, the bride will be setting in
[1:27:18] glory. If he's right about the grizzly
[1:27:21] bear and he's right about the caribou
[1:27:23] and he's right about the American pope,
[1:27:26] he's also right about your
[1:27:29] future. The blood
[1:27:32] speaks. It spoke to you tonight. It's
[1:27:35] speaking right now. It's reminding you
[1:27:39] your future is in God.
[1:27:42] I ain't going to let no devil influence
[1:27:44] my life because he says, "Well, your
[1:27:46] future's this and your future's this and
[1:27:48] your He got no control over my future."
[1:27:52] [Applause]
[1:27:54] He has no control over my
[1:27:57] future. Matter of fact, I know his
[1:27:59] future.
[1:28:02] My Bible said he'd be cast in the lake
[1:28:04] of fire, death, hell, and the grave.
[1:28:07] Brother Steve, I'll be there when it
[1:28:09] happens.
[1:28:12] I say, "Save it a little while, sister.
[1:28:15] We're taking it back. What the devil
[1:28:17] stole from me, we're taking it back.
[1:28:20] We're taking back this land. We're
[1:28:23] taking back this earth for a millennial
[1:28:26] kingdom for the church of the living
[1:28:28] God. I don't want just part of it. I
[1:28:31] want everything that belongs to the
[1:28:33] church of the living God. Give me the
[1:28:36] Holy Ghost. Give me the spoken word.
[1:28:38] Give me the opening of the scriptures.
[1:28:41] Give me life and truth.
[1:28:44] Hallelujah.
[1:28:48] Now, I'm not going to go home
[1:28:49] empty-handed.
[1:28:54] As sure as your a gene had to be in your
[1:28:57] father before your natural birth,
[1:29:02] your spiritual gene had to be in God
[1:29:07] because you're an expression of the
[1:29:09] attribute of his thought
[1:29:12] before there was a foundation of the
[1:29:14] world.
[1:29:16] Now, now you are a gene in God.
[1:29:21] But the difference between human beings
[1:29:23] when they have a a child in their loins,
[1:29:26] it's in their human life and it's
[1:29:29] expressed a different way. But God
[1:29:31] carries his gene in the loins of his
[1:29:34] mind.
[1:29:36] So therefore, when God
[1:29:38] speaks, that's his seed life.
[1:29:42] Come on, church. You are
[1:29:44] spoken before the world began. You are a
[1:29:48] spoken word seed child of the living
[1:29:51] God.
[1:29:54] [Applause]
[1:29:56] To be a Christian, you have to be.
[1:30:01] [Applause]
[1:30:03] To be a human being, I had to come from
[1:30:06] a human.
[1:30:09] To be a Christian, you had to come from
[1:30:13] God.
[1:30:15] Christian don't mean church joining.
[1:30:17] Christian don't mean associations and
[1:30:19] fellowships. Christianity is the life of
[1:30:23] God is expressed in a human being. I am
[1:30:26] dead but yet I live. It is not I that
[1:30:30] liveth but it's Christ that liveth in
[1:30:32] me.
[1:30:35] [Music]
[1:30:37] [Applause]
[1:30:40] Then we'll see this. We'll see that
[1:30:42] before that was a speck of stardust.
[1:30:44] Before God was even God. Yes, sir.
[1:30:47] That'd take some preaching to explain,
[1:30:49] wouldn't it?
[1:30:51] Before God was even God. Because God is
[1:30:54] an object of worship. Before he was
[1:30:56] worshiped. In other words, before there
[1:30:57] was an angel to worship God. Yes, sir.
[1:31:00] Amen. And he was known only as eternal
[1:31:03] spirit. That's right. The bride was
[1:31:07] already in his mind.
[1:31:10] Yes, she was. She was existing
[1:31:13] in his thoughts.
[1:31:16] Y'all know this. And what about the
[1:31:18] thoughts of God? They are eternal,
[1:31:22] are they not?
[1:31:25] Yes, sir. Come on. You're human, are you
[1:31:29] not? So, just as you are a gene to
[1:31:32] become a human being from your father,
[1:31:35] you also are eternal because you're an
[1:31:37] eternal life gene from Almighty God.
[1:31:42] Eternal thoughts of God. Let me ask you,
[1:31:46] are you the thoughts are the thoughts of
[1:31:48] God eternal? I love brother Bam. He
[1:31:50] said, "If you can see this, he you'll
[1:31:52] see many things."
[1:31:55] Isn't it odd how blind Leodysia can only
[1:31:58] see partial things?
[1:32:01] Y'all know what it is. It's It's
[1:32:03] considered to be blind, but it says a it
[1:32:05] sees a lot of things. That's right. No
[1:32:07] different than when they went down
[1:32:09] there. You remember brother Bam was
[1:32:10] talking to a guy one day and he said,
[1:32:11] "Well, if you're if you have the power
[1:32:13] like Elijah and Paul," he said, "strike
[1:32:14] me blind." He said, "I can't. You're
[1:32:16] already blind."
[1:32:19] And the guy said, "Well, Paul struck him
[1:32:21] naturally blind." He said, "But Elisha
[1:32:22] spoke him spiritually blind." And he
[1:32:25] said, "You're already blind." Now, now
[1:32:27] look what he done. He turned and showed
[1:32:29] where Elisha walked right up to the king
[1:32:32] of the Syrians. And the king of the
[1:32:34] Syrians was led into captivity by what
[1:32:37] he couldn't see.
[1:32:40] He could see the cabin. He could see
[1:32:42] Gahesa. He could see a man didn't know
[1:32:45] he was Elisha. He could see the woods.
[1:32:47] He could see the army. He could see
[1:32:49] everything but who Elisha was.
[1:32:53] And because he couldn't see
[1:32:55] Elisha, that's what put him in bondage.
[1:32:59] Come on now.
[1:33:01] And the same one that closed the king's
[1:33:04] eye looked over at Gahhesa and said,
[1:33:07] "Lord, open this boy's eyes." And he
[1:33:10] went from somebody seeing what he
[1:33:11] thought was everything until a new
[1:33:14] dimension was opened up and he could see
[1:33:16] angels.
[1:33:19] Come on, y'all. Those angels never did
[1:33:22] anything. Those angels didn't do
[1:33:25] anything in that battle at all. It just
[1:33:27] gave courage to the young man that they
[1:33:30] was in the battle.
[1:33:34] And a son or daughter of God, if you
[1:33:36] just get knowledge and courage of who
[1:33:38] you are and what's on the inside of you,
[1:33:41] there's no demons can stand before you
[1:33:44] because you're the church of the living
[1:33:46] God. And she will
[1:33:49] be an invincible army. Well, let me
[1:33:52] petition you tonight. I believe she's
[1:33:55] here. I believe I believe this is the
[1:33:59] time and I believe we are the people.
[1:34:05] I believe you've been identified.
[1:34:10] [Applause]
[1:34:13] The thoughts are are eternal are they
[1:34:14] not?
[1:34:16] Now the prophet will go on to say we've
[1:34:19] studied and proven God's infinite in his
[1:34:21] abilities. God must be omni omnisient
[1:34:23] all knowing and he is now not learning.
[1:34:27] Well, that's a new thing for you and I
[1:34:29] because we're always learning. That's
[1:34:30] right. But God's not learning.
[1:34:33] So God knows everything all the time at
[1:34:37] one time. He don't have to learn
[1:34:40] nothing. It's not a developmental stage.
[1:34:44] He knew in the beginning what you would
[1:34:46] be in the end. So brother Brandham says
[1:34:48] it like this. He said now he's then he
[1:34:51] is not now learning nor is he taking
[1:34:54] counsel
[1:34:55] even with himself
[1:34:58] nor is he at any time adding to his
[1:35:01] knowledge
[1:35:03] if he can add to his knowledge then he's
[1:35:06] not all knowing then the best we could
[1:35:08] say is that he sometime will be but that
[1:35:11] is not scriptural he's all knowing he
[1:35:13] has every he he has never
[1:35:17] I I tell you this is shout material He
[1:35:19] has never had a new thought
[1:35:25] about anything
[1:35:28] because all his thoughts has always had
[1:35:31] and always will have and he knows the
[1:35:33] end from the beginning because thus the
[1:35:35] thoughts of God are eternal and they are
[1:35:39] real.
[1:35:41] He has never had a new thought about
[1:35:43] anything.
[1:35:46] Wait a minute then. Uhhuh. Then you can
[1:35:49] see the way you think from day to day.
[1:35:53] Well, he loves me. He don't love me. He
[1:35:55] loves me. He don't love me. I'm going to
[1:35:57] be saved. I don't know if I'm saved. I'm
[1:35:59] going to be there. I don't know if I'm
[1:36:01] going to be there. Now, come on, church.
[1:36:02] I love a Pentecostal experience, but I
[1:36:04] don't like Pentecostal doctrine.
[1:36:07] Their doctrine kept people up and down,
[1:36:10] up and down, up and down. Because what
[1:36:12] they do is they preach a sinless
[1:36:14] perfection.
[1:36:15] And they teach people that if they get
[1:36:17] the Holy Ghost, they're not human
[1:36:19] anymore.
[1:36:21] But let me tell you, you're going to be
[1:36:22] human till you go beyond the grave.
[1:36:25] Until you change this old body on the
[1:36:28] outside, you're going to be human. So
[1:36:30] God gave you the Holy Ghost to put this
[1:36:33] human in check. And when this thing
[1:36:36] starts rising up, the Holy Spirit says,
[1:36:38] "Don't do that. Don't go there. Don't
[1:36:41] say that." But the human will always be
[1:36:44] there.
[1:36:45] That's why Paul said there's a battle.
[1:36:50] That's why there's a battle. And you
[1:36:53] say, "Well, preacher, I messed up." That
[1:36:55] don't mean you need to get reborn.
[1:36:57] [Applause]
[1:37:00] Come on, church. Don't you let that
[1:37:03] devil do you that way?
[1:37:06] Come on. I I I've used this a few times.
[1:37:09] I hope it'd be all right. Come here a
[1:37:11] minute, brother. Come here. Let me just
[1:37:12] say something to you real quick. You
[1:37:14] know, just because somebody uh has a
[1:37:16] mistake or it don't mean it changes the
[1:37:18] person every right might hurt a little
[1:37:21] and take a couple minutes to kind of
[1:37:22] walk it off, you know, may maybe even
[1:37:24] three or four services, get that thing
[1:37:26] walked off of you good, you know, but
[1:37:28] but uh what's your name, brother?
[1:37:29] Charles. Charles. Brother Charles.
[1:37:31] Brother Charles, I I hate to do this to
[1:37:32] you, but just see just fall down the
[1:37:34] floor for me. Just just fall right down
[1:37:36] on that floor.
[1:37:38] Yeah. Now, come on. Get back up.
[1:37:42] Thank you. Thank you. What's your name?
[1:37:44] Charles. Oh,
[1:37:49] you're still You didn't turn into a
[1:37:51] giraffe. You didn't turn into an
[1:37:54] elephant. You were a son of God going
[1:37:56] down and you were a son of God coming
[1:37:58] up. And your name is still Charles.
[1:38:01] You're still Come on, church. Don't you
[1:38:04] tell me that if there's some little fall
[1:38:07] that it's going to change who you are.
[1:38:10] Get up and walk it off. Tell that devil,
[1:38:14] "I'm a child of God, and you can't
[1:38:18] destroy
[1:38:19] me. I was in God before there was a sin
[1:38:23] or a sinner or an angel or a devil. And
[1:38:26] when all of this is over,
[1:38:29] when this great fall is finished, I will
[1:38:32] still be
[1:38:33] [Applause]
[1:38:36] because God don't get new thoughts.
[1:38:41] He didn't get up this morning trying to
[1:38:44] make up his mind who you are. He didn't
[1:38:47] he he didn't set up and counsel the
[1:38:49] angels to figure out what's going to be
[1:38:51] with you. He already had that and he
[1:38:54] don't have a new thought concerning you.
[1:38:56] I I love how brother Bam says this. He
[1:38:59] said, "The purpose of God according to
[1:39:01] election might stand not of works."
[1:39:03] Somebody say it. not of works, but of
[1:39:07] him that calleth.
[1:39:10] This love.
[1:39:12] Oh, this is why they threw the church
[1:39:13] age book out. This love is elective
[1:39:16] love.
[1:39:21] [Applause]
[1:39:23] He fell in love with you
[1:39:26] and there ain't nothing can change it.
[1:39:28] [Music]
[1:39:30] The Bible said while I was yet a sinner,
[1:39:33] he died for me. He didn't love me
[1:39:36] anymore,
[1:39:38] the night I got saved than the night
[1:39:40] that I was a drunk in the street
[1:39:44] because he loved me with a love that
[1:39:46] could save me by the blood of his own
[1:39:49] son. And when I got saved,
[1:39:52] the love of God became manifest in my
[1:39:54] life. This love is elective love. It's
[1:39:58] his love for his elect and his love for
[1:40:00] them is apart from
[1:40:05] is apart from
[1:40:07] human merit
[1:40:11] human merit. Now that's where it gets
[1:40:12] messed up. We've been I've been doing a
[1:40:15] deep dive into this uh Catholicism and
[1:40:17] Protestants and because of all the
[1:40:19] because of all the things that's you
[1:40:21] know going on in the modern world. I'm
[1:40:22] not going to preach it all to you
[1:40:23] tonight, but I've been doing a little
[1:40:25] deep dive into it, and I found out
[1:40:26] something that was amazing that some of
[1:40:28] the greatest uh differences in the
[1:40:30] Reformation that caused Lutheran to
[1:40:33] break away was this little word merit.
[1:40:36] It's called merit. Do you know the
[1:40:38] Catholics teach what they call a
[1:40:39] treasury of merits?
[1:40:42] And and and what you do is basically
[1:40:44] that you get you get sanctified to get
[1:40:47] justified. Yeah. Seriously, you you see
[1:40:50] what you got to get baptism and then
[1:40:52] that starts you towards your
[1:40:54] justification. But see the difference
[1:40:56] between what Luther taught and what they
[1:40:58] teach is Luther said the just live by
[1:41:00] faith. Because he took it from Paul when
[1:41:03] Saul Paul said by grace you are saved
[1:41:05] and that is through faith. That's right.
[1:41:08] See then it was faith alone. It wasn't
[1:41:10] faith and something else.
[1:41:12] So what they were saying is that you
[1:41:14] can't work yourself to the place of
[1:41:17] human merit to become justified before
[1:41:20] God. There is no merit that can take you
[1:41:22] in the presence of God. It has to be the
[1:41:25] blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:41:29] See, brother Bam said, "See, then that's
[1:41:31] it. You can only merit salvation through
[1:41:33] the blood."
[1:41:35] See, the merits that you need tonight
[1:41:37] comes from the sovereign grace of God.
[1:41:39] No matter what you could do, you could
[1:41:41] never merit nothing. The only thing you
[1:41:43] can do is believe on him that justifies
[1:41:46] the ungodly.
[1:41:48] Yes, sir.
[1:41:50] Somebody said, "Bro, Wayne, you're
[1:41:51] getting pretty heavy in this
[1:41:52] predestination." Well, let me say what
[1:41:53] Brother Bam said. Show plainly the
[1:41:55] predestination is the only one that's
[1:41:57] considered in redemption.
[1:41:59] [Music]
[1:42:01] The predestinated is the only one
[1:42:03] considered in redemption. Do you see?
[1:42:05] Let me say that. The predestinated is
[1:42:07] the only ones considered in predemption
[1:42:09] might be like they think they are and
[1:42:11] some but the real redemption is to those
[1:42:13] as predestinated because the very word
[1:42:15] redeemed means to bring back. Is that
[1:42:17] right? To redeem anything is to bring it
[1:42:19] back to its original place. Do you see
[1:42:22] that it's redemption comes to the
[1:42:24] predestinated because they were decided
[1:42:27] or in God and they're only being put
[1:42:29] back into God. Brother Bam told a
[1:42:31] beautiful story when he talked about the
[1:42:33] little eagle that was in the chicken
[1:42:35] yard. I mean, what a beautiful story.
[1:42:38] What a beautiful story. Mama Eagle never
[1:42:42] made baby eagle an eagle.
[1:42:46] Simply never made him. Baby eagle was
[1:42:49] just hid away.
[1:42:53] Before mama ever left the nest, he was
[1:42:57] already eagle because eagle life was in
[1:43:00] him. So all she did was flew over the
[1:43:04] chicken yard.
[1:43:06] That's all she did.
[1:43:09] But till she was speaking, the blood
[1:43:11] begin to speak. And when the blood
[1:43:14] started speaking,
[1:43:16] it started hitting the hair drum and the
[1:43:19] little eagle, the beating of the drum
[1:43:20] took off.
[1:43:23] Come on. The beating of the drum, the
[1:43:24] symphonies begin to change. The books
[1:43:27] begin to change, begin to move from
[1:43:29] eagle, amen, from chicken life to eagle
[1:43:31] life.
[1:43:33] That's right. You You know what I'm
[1:43:34] talking about. Mama Eagle never had no
[1:43:37] records of chicken life. There was no
[1:43:40] record there at all of chicken life. All
[1:43:42] she had a record of was eagle life. She
[1:43:45] come to redeem eagle.
[1:43:48] This message is an eagle message. And
[1:43:51] it's come to redeem eagles.
[1:43:55] That's why you can fly higher. You can
[1:43:58] fly faster. You can catch the revelation
[1:44:01] that lays there. You are not like the
[1:44:03] cousin Hawk. You don't have to sit there
[1:44:05] and wait on dead roadkill. You can fly
[1:44:08] into the heavenlies and catch the
[1:44:11] current revelations.
[1:44:13] Come on, church. We can't be lazy
[1:44:15] Christians and depend on revelation
[1:44:17] that's 100 years old. Come on. We are
[1:44:19] the church of the living God. There is
[1:44:21] revelation breaking in this message
[1:44:23] every day.
[1:44:25] It's breaking every day. And if you're
[1:44:27] not staying in this word, you're getting
[1:44:29] left behind.
[1:44:31] Come on.
[1:44:33] I've seen people get in church fights
[1:44:35] and they get in this little fuss and
[1:44:37] this little fight and something and five
[1:44:38] years later that's what they're still
[1:44:40] talking about. The fight, the fuss.
[1:44:42] Maybe they had family trouble. Some five
[1:44:44] years later, that's all they got on
[1:44:46] their mind. And look at the gap. Look at
[1:44:48] the faith gap that they missed down
[1:44:50] through that time. Listen, don't you let
[1:44:52] anything take your attention off of the
[1:44:55] revelation of this word. It is
[1:44:57] revelation that'll give you power. It is
[1:44:59] revelation that'll give you authority.
[1:45:01] It's the devil don't want you to know
[1:45:04] who you are.
[1:45:09] Troubles everywhere. Look up. Your
[1:45:11] redemption draws nigh.
[1:45:15] Put your eyes upon the Lord. Don't let
[1:45:16] it Don't let the Don't let the
[1:45:18] revelation moving. Don't Don't Don't get
[1:45:21] caught up in things.
[1:45:22] [Music]
[1:45:24] Do you know why that baby eagle knew it
[1:45:26] was an eagle?
[1:45:29] Because it was daddy was an eagle and
[1:45:31] his grandpa was an eagle and his grandma
[1:45:34] was an eagle. It was eagle all the way
[1:45:36] back.
[1:45:40] There was no time in that eagle's life
[1:45:42] it was a chicken.
[1:45:45] It was just in a chicken yard.
[1:45:48] Come on, church. I don't care how lost
[1:45:52] it was. It was still illegal.
[1:45:57] But mama was a redeemer.
[1:46:00] And when mama started speaking, you know
[1:46:02] something I think's awesome. Mama spoke.
[1:46:04] And when mama's voice, it didn't take
[1:46:06] the baby back to the nest. It took the
[1:46:10] baby back to creation.
[1:46:14] This message took us back not just to a
[1:46:17] church, but the prophet bypassed all of
[1:46:20] that and took you all the way back in
[1:46:23] the mind.
[1:46:27] to let you know that you were here then.
[1:46:31] So no matter what happened between that
[1:46:33] time and now, you were an eagle then. So
[1:46:37] you're an eagle tonight.
[1:46:41] We never became eagles. We always were
[1:46:43] eagles.
[1:46:48] Now you know the Bible. You know it
[1:46:49] well. You know the Bible says that where
[1:46:52] the carcass is, they are the eagles.
[1:46:55] We're the eagles. Now, the carcass is,
[1:46:58] brother Bam said, see, not the carcass
[1:47:00] of Luther's age, not the carcass of
[1:47:02] Wesley's age. He said he also died for
[1:47:05] this part of the word.
[1:47:08] This part of the word. He died for the
[1:47:09] opening of the seals, too. Not just for
[1:47:12] justification and sanctification. He
[1:47:15] died so we could preach the realities of
[1:47:18] the lamb's book of life. He didn't die
[1:47:21] so we could just talk about
[1:47:22] justification or the Holy Ghost. He died
[1:47:25] so we could talk about adoption and sons
[1:47:28] and daughters of God returning to full
[1:47:30] inheritance.
[1:47:32] Do you do you see that's why he said
[1:47:34] where the carcass is there? The eagles
[1:47:36] gathered. Then the carcass is the word
[1:47:38] of the age the eagle feed on.
[1:47:41] Now now Jesus called it meat in due
[1:47:44] season. Right? That's what he called it.
[1:47:47] Meat in due season. The eagles feed
[1:47:50] there. And brother Bam says, "See, when
[1:47:53] you recognize
[1:47:55] that this message is eagle food,
[1:48:01] when you see this message is Matthew 24
[1:48:06] carcass, when you recognize it is meat
[1:48:09] in season, you have heard
[1:48:13] from your theophony."
[1:48:16] Come on, church. You have heard your
[1:48:19] theophony speak to you.
[1:48:23] It spoke louder than any church voice.
[1:48:26] It spoke louder than the voice of your
[1:48:27] mama and daddy. This this voice has
[1:48:31] influenced everything in our life.
[1:48:34] [Music]
[1:48:34] [Applause]
[1:48:37] You have heard from your theophony.
[1:48:42] Brother Wayne, I know God has theophony.
[1:48:44] Let me tell you, you have theophony,
[1:48:46] too.
[1:48:48] When he shall appear, you shall be like
[1:48:51] him, for you shall see him as he is.
[1:48:55] Come on, church. You know you got
[1:48:57] theophony the same as God's got
[1:48:59] theophony.
[1:49:03] Absolutely. You got theophony the same
[1:49:05] as he's got theophony. Do you know that
[1:49:07] God entered the theophony and talked to
[1:49:09] Abraham in the Bible?
[1:49:12] God himself in theophony stepped down
[1:49:14] and talked to a human being.
[1:49:16] Now I I don't know maybe maybe when you
[1:49:19] think start thinking about this but but
[1:49:21] brother Brandham says it very clearly
[1:49:23] that all believers go there when they
[1:49:25] leave here into theophony.
[1:49:28] But you see that brother Brandham said
[1:49:30] thank God for the opening of these
[1:49:31] seals. Amen. That we might be able to
[1:49:33] see that God came in the spoke to
[1:49:37] Abraham your father.
[1:49:42] Now a lot of people ask who who is
[1:49:44] Melazdc?
[1:49:46] Brother Brandham preached a sermon. Who
[1:49:48] is this Melazedc?
[1:49:51] Now when Paul was preaching it, he said
[1:49:53] in Hebrews 5, I got a lot of things I
[1:49:55] could say to you concerning Melazdc. But
[1:49:58] being that's right that you are babies
[1:50:02] you have need of milk
[1:50:04] but strong meat
[1:50:07] belonging to them of a full
[1:50:10] when the fullness of a do when the
[1:50:13] fullness of a when the fullness of
[1:50:15] Christ in the pyramid there'll come
[1:50:18] another message
[1:50:20] [Applause]
[1:50:24] yeah and Melazdc will be spoken about
[1:50:27] plainly
[1:50:28] [Applause]
[1:50:31] Now, now think about this. Just listen
[1:50:33] to the title. This will help you. Who is
[1:50:35] this Melazedc?
[1:50:37] Can I just ask you in a different way?
[1:50:39] Who is this?
[1:50:42] Who is this?
[1:50:44] [Applause]
[1:50:45] Melazedc.
[1:50:48] Who is this? Stephen.
[1:50:52] Who is this?
[1:50:54] Mazdc.
[1:50:56] That's who it is. That's who brought
[1:50:58] this message. This wasn't William
[1:51:01] Brandham's message. This is
[1:51:03] pre-incarnate knowledge.
[1:51:06] This is knowledge that was before the
[1:51:08] world began. Where did William,
[1:51:11] Brother Brandham would talk to a lady
[1:51:13] and he'd say, "Sister, you know I don't
[1:51:15] know you." He said, "But before you were
[1:51:16] here, when you were just a young girl,"
[1:51:18] he said, "Now you know I don't know
[1:51:20] that. Somebody else knows that."
[1:51:24] Brother Rand didn't know it. Who knew
[1:51:26] it? The same one that had him speak to a
[1:51:29] young lady about a checkered dress and
[1:51:31] getting bit by a dog was the same one
[1:51:33] that had him speak to the bride in
[1:51:35] general
[1:51:37] about when you was just a child in your
[1:51:39] father's mind. The enemy entered into
[1:51:42] the Eden and caused this problem,
[1:51:47] pre-incarnate knowledge. Now y'all know
[1:51:49] there ain't nobody but one man knew
[1:51:51] these things.
[1:51:54] Who else knew what happened before the
[1:51:55] world began? Only Jesus knew that. And
[1:52:00] pre-incarnate knowledge came from God
[1:52:02] and come into this age. Now brother
[1:52:04] Brandham says when the question was
[1:52:06] asked who is this mechazedc he said do
[1:52:08] you see this was one of the things the
[1:52:09] seventh angel was supposed to tell you
[1:52:11] about. He said and being that it's a
[1:52:14] question he said it behooves me to talk
[1:52:15] to you about it. So he's telling you
[1:52:18] it's my job, not Adam Clark's.
[1:52:20] [Applause]
[1:52:22] Come on. It's not the school of theology
[1:52:24] down here. They don't have the job to
[1:52:26] tell you who Melazdc was. Cuz they say,
[1:52:28] "Well, it could be a person. It could be
[1:52:30] a priesthood. It could be. It could be."
[1:52:32] There's a lot of could be. And what we
[1:52:34] needed for rapture was not a could be.
[1:52:36] We needed
[1:52:39] vindication. We might as well preach. We
[1:52:41] needed vindication. We needed something
[1:52:43] knocked the walls of the devil down. We
[1:52:46] had to break through our unbelief and
[1:52:47] our confusion. That's why Adam Clark
[1:52:50] couldn't take us in a rapture.
[1:52:53] Somebody told me a long time ago, they
[1:52:54] said, "Well, Brother Brandham, you know,
[1:52:57] I forget the word they use, plagiarize.
[1:52:58] He he plagiarized Clark or he
[1:53:00] plagiarized this guy, this guy." Well,
[1:53:02] I've read all their books. I'm I'm just
[1:53:04] going to confess. I've read most all
[1:53:06] their books. And I did it years ago.
[1:53:10] Years ago. You know what I found out? I
[1:53:12] found them quoting this guy. I found
[1:53:14] them quoting this guy. And then they'll
[1:53:16] say, "Well, it could be perhaps this. It
[1:53:19] could be perhaps this. It could be
[1:53:21] perhaps this." None of them could say,
[1:53:24] "Thus saith the
[1:53:29] Lord." But we have moved into the age of
[1:53:33] adoption where the fullness of the word
[1:53:36] has come by vindication of the pillar of
[1:53:39] fire. King theophony has influenced this
[1:53:43] bride to have a perfect faith.
[1:53:46] Not a hope so faith, not a maybe so
[1:53:48] faith, a vindicated faith.
[1:53:55] So what's the revelation of measc
[1:53:57] brother Wayne? He was God.
[1:54:00] [Applause]
[1:54:03] He was God. And in the beginning was the
[1:54:05] word. What was before the beginning?
[1:54:08] What was before the beginning? God.
[1:54:10] Elohim. So before the beginning, he was
[1:54:13] known as King Elohim. When he met
[1:54:16] Abraham, he was known as King Theophony.
[1:54:19] And when he came as Jesus, he was King
[1:54:21] Jesus or the King of Kings. He's three
[1:54:24] different kings. The same as your body,
[1:54:27] soul, and spirit. He was God. He was
[1:54:30] theophony. And then he became flesh.
[1:54:33] [Applause]
[1:54:33] [Music]
[1:54:35] [Applause]
[1:54:36] The effect of the revelation.
[1:54:39] Come on now. The effect of the
[1:54:40] revelation. This revelation is not
[1:54:42] pointless.
[1:54:44] This revelation is not without meaning.
[1:54:46] The effect of the revelation is once
[1:54:48] that Abraham saw that in Genesis 14. In
[1:54:52] Genesis 18 when that when that Melchazdc
[1:54:56] came to his tent door in a
[1:54:59] different skin.
[1:55:06] in a
[1:55:08] Genesis 14, he appeared, but he appeared
[1:55:10] again in Genesis 18. And Abraham said,
[1:55:13] "Lord,"
[1:55:16] the effect of the revelation was he knew
[1:55:18] there was one God. And however he
[1:55:21] appeared, he was still God.
[1:55:25] And we are Abraham's seed. And we've got
[1:55:28] the revelation tonight of Elohim.
[1:55:33] But when Elohim appeared to Abraham, he
[1:55:35] appeared to him as the word. And that
[1:55:38] was when he said, "We're Sarah, thy
[1:55:40] wife."
[1:55:42] She's in the tent behind you. Why has
[1:55:44] she laughed? She didn't laugh out loud.
[1:55:46] She laughed in her heart.
[1:55:49] Because Paul said, "The word of God is a
[1:55:53] discerner of the thought and the intent
[1:55:55] of the heart." And Melazedc of the
[1:55:58] old became Jesus of the new. And Jesus
[1:56:03] said,"Simon, thou son of Jonas." Come
[1:56:07] on, little woman. He said, "Go get your
[1:56:09] husband." Amen. The same one that stood
[1:56:11] at the tent door was standing at the
[1:56:14] well.
[1:56:17] King Theophony.
[1:56:21] Come on now. But that one at the well
[1:56:24] said in the days of Noah and when it's
[1:56:28] like it was in the days of Lot, two
[1:56:31] secrets.
[1:56:32] [Music]
[1:56:34] Noah's day there was Enoch.
[1:56:38] In the days of Lot, there was Abraham.
[1:56:41] And when it's in those days, the Son of
[1:56:44] Man will appear again like he did there.
[1:56:47] And then brother Brandham turns his back
[1:56:49] to the congregation and begins to tell
[1:56:51] them what they're thinking in their
[1:56:53] hearts because the same angel that was
[1:56:55] at the tent door returned in the last
[1:56:58] days, King Theophony has come to
[1:57:01] influence this bride into pre-incarnate
[1:57:04] revelation. As she might know, I've come
[1:57:07] from God, but I'm going back to God. And
[1:57:11] there ain't enough devils to keep me
[1:57:12] from going.
[1:57:19] [Applause]
[1:57:22] You ever heard a Theophony preach?
[1:57:26] Come on, church.
[1:57:28] Sure. Brother Ram said, "When Jesus went
[1:57:31] to preach to souls in prison, he
[1:57:33] preached in a theophony like I saw
[1:57:36] beyond the curtain of time."
[1:57:43] Do you know what was going on Friday
[1:57:44] night? In Saturday evening when the tomb
[1:57:47] when Jesus body was laying in the tomb,
[1:57:49] you know what was going on beyond the
[1:57:50] curtain of time, the theophony was
[1:57:53] preaching
[1:57:55] and that was called the third pull.
[1:57:59] Come on, church. His corporal body ain't
[1:58:02] here tonight, but the same one that went
[1:58:05] into hell to deliver Abraham is the same
[1:58:08] one that comes in this age to deliver
[1:58:10] the children of God. Amen. that you
[1:58:13] might have the influence of the message
[1:58:15] to tell you you have the offhony.
[1:58:19] You're coming to change.
[1:58:22] [Music]
[1:58:24] Come on, folks. We're going from the
[1:58:25] dust to the stars. And we're going to
[1:58:27] get there through the flesh. Revelation
[1:58:29] of how God came into the flesh, died,
[1:58:32] buried, and rose again to take you with
[1:58:34] him into the heavens.
[1:58:36] You know it's true.
[1:58:39] You know, you know within your heart
[1:58:42] that you were at that meeting between
[1:58:43] Abraham and Melanzedc.
[1:58:48] You were there.
[1:58:50] Somebody said, "Well, there wasn't
[1:58:52] nobody there but them two." But the
[1:58:53] Bible said, the Bible said that he was
[1:58:58] carrying something in his
[1:59:00] loins. That Levi was there whether
[1:59:03] you've seen him or
[1:59:05] not. Come on, church. And just as Levi
[1:59:08] was in Abraham, you and I were in
[1:59:13] Christ. And when Jesus came to the
[1:59:16] earth,
[1:59:18] come on. In the rise of the sun, brother
[1:59:20] Bam said in Gethsemane, the spirit of
[1:59:22] God left him. He said because we were in
[1:59:25] him and we went with him to the cross
[1:59:30] and we paid for our sins at the cross
[1:59:33] and we died with him and we was buried
[1:59:35] with him. But we rose with him on the
[1:59:39] third day and right here this evening.
[1:59:43] We are identified in the resurrection of
[1:59:45] Jesus Christ.
[1:59:47] [Applause]
[1:59:50] I I I just have to be honest. Sometimes
[1:59:52] people they get ashamed of the message.
[1:59:55] Let me tell you something. This ain't
[1:59:57] something to be ashamed of.
[2:00:00] Somebody said to me one time said,
[2:00:02] "Brother Wayne, why do you quote brother
[2:00:03] Brandham all the time?"
[2:00:04] [Applause]
[2:00:06] Well, I you know, I really couldn't I I
[2:00:08] didn't have a good answer for him,
[2:00:09] brother. I didn't. I was sitting there
[2:00:11] thinking, "Well, God, you know why I do,
[2:00:13] but they don't know why I do." Can Can I
[2:00:16] Can I tell you what happened to me? You
[2:00:18] won't think I'm a fanatic.
[2:00:21] I I was in a hotel room and I had been
[2:00:23] listening to the tape and I had my
[2:00:25] laptop. Y'all know how you do. Pull your
[2:00:27] laptop out and you don't plug it in
[2:00:29] because you don't want to fool with it,
[2:00:30] right? Then I was listening to a tape
[2:00:32] and the battery run out on it. Uh-huh.
[2:00:34] And I laid there and slept a little
[2:00:35] while before service and and I just
[2:00:37] closed the lid on it. My phone rang, got
[2:00:39] up and it was a brother. He's gone now.
[2:00:41] It was a brother out in Arizona. And and
[2:00:43] this brother a month or two in front of
[2:00:46] this had had been sitting in a service
[2:00:48] of mine and I was preaching the message
[2:00:50] and he said, this is his testimony. He
[2:00:53] said, he said, "I was watching you
[2:00:54] preach." He said, "And something I said
[2:00:57] to the Lord." I said, "Lord, that man
[2:00:58] was born to preach the message of the
[2:01:00] hour." And he said, "A voice spoke to me
[2:01:03] and said, "He has been born to do this,
[2:01:05] but he's having a financial issue with a
[2:01:07] truck, and you're going to help him."
[2:01:12] That man met me in the back of the
[2:01:14] church and walked up to me and said,
[2:01:16] "You know that little trouble you're
[2:01:17] having with that financial with that
[2:01:18] truck?" Now, I was a full-time
[2:01:20] evangelist and had a truck and and and
[2:01:21] it was skimpy on the payments.
[2:01:24] That man never asked me how much I owed
[2:01:27] on that truck,
[2:01:29] but he wrote me a check that covered it
[2:01:32] and the ties that needed to be paid on
[2:01:34] the check.
[2:01:37] Never asked me one time what how much
[2:01:39] money I owed on that truck.
[2:01:45] Then that same guy Yes, sir. said to me,
[2:01:48] "Why you quote brother Bram so much?"
[2:01:52] Now, I'm I'm feeling kind of funny. So,
[2:01:55] I'm on the phone with him and I said I
[2:01:57] said, "Well, brother," I said I said,
[2:01:58] "Because it's God's prophet." And and
[2:02:00] and and and he said, "Well, the power is
[2:02:02] in the scripture." I said, "Well, you've
[2:02:04] never been with me and seen me read one
[2:02:05] of these quotes." And and I've seen I've
[2:02:07] seen explosions happen. Just a quote and
[2:02:10] the power of God dropping. And he said,
[2:02:12] 'Well, anyhow, well, he gets off the
[2:02:13] phone with me and I'm standing there and
[2:02:15] I'm getting ready for church and and I I
[2:02:17] think I was actually combed my hair or
[2:02:19] something and I was standing in the
[2:02:20] mirror and I just stopped and said,
[2:02:21] 'Lord, I don't want people to think I'm
[2:02:23] a crazy man. Help me. Give me an answer.
[2:02:26] Let me know. Let me let me have an
[2:02:27] answer for these people.
[2:02:30] And God be my witness. I hear the voice
[2:02:32] of the prophet
[2:02:35] and I I'm by myself. So, I back out of
[2:02:39] the bathroom and I look
[2:02:42] And his voice is coming from that
[2:02:44] computer with a dead battery.
[2:02:46] [Applause]
[2:02:48] And it's right in the place of unveiling
[2:02:51] of God. Uhhuh. Where he said the same
[2:02:54] pillar of fire that wrote the Old
[2:02:57] Testament visited Paul and wrote the New
[2:03:00] Testament. He said, "But now it has come
[2:03:03] to reveal the revelation that was
[2:03:06] written in it."
[2:03:07] And he said, "I would rather be
[2:03:10] identified with that
[2:03:12] than all of the Baptist and all of the
[2:03:15] Lutheran or all of anything else." And
[2:03:17] right there, I picked the phone back up
[2:03:19] and I called the brother. I said,
[2:03:20] "Brother, cuz it identifies
[2:03:22] me. It identifies me. I was in that
[2:03:27] pillar of fire
[2:03:29] before. And because I was there, I
[2:03:32] identify with this message. I'm not
[2:03:35] ashamed of this message. It's taking me
[2:03:37] back home. It's telling me who I was.
[2:03:45] It's telling us where we came from.
[2:03:48] With vindication and authority. God
[2:03:51] bless you. Won't you come? I'll preach
[2:03:52] all night. If you don't, come on. Come
[2:03:53] on.
[2:03:55] It's identifying us.
[2:03:58] See, I was there. I was there with him
[2:04:00] in Come on.
[2:04:03] You know, you know you were there. Yes,
[2:04:05] sir. You were there. And when we start
[2:04:08] talking about it, you start remembering
[2:04:11] when we start talking about it. You were
[2:04:13] there when the Holy Ghost fell on the
[2:04:14] day of Pentecost. Remember remember how
[2:04:17] it felt when the power of God begins to
[2:04:21] walk into a building. Let me tell you,
[2:04:23] I'm not ashamed of my Pentecostal
[2:04:25] brothers. I shouted with Peter. I spoke
[2:04:28] in tongues with James.
[2:04:31] I rolled in the floor in the Holy Ghost
[2:04:34] and I got up with Peter when he said
[2:04:36] this is that which Job prophesied in the
[2:04:39] last days. This is not a drinking like
[2:04:42] you would think. This is a new
[2:04:45] wine. It's the wine of the stimulation
[2:04:49] of the Holy Ghost. I say pass the bottle
[2:04:53] again. I say drink away your wearies.
[2:04:56] Drink away your troubles.
[2:04:59] I was there. I was there. I was there
[2:05:02] when they cut Paul's head off.
[2:05:06] I was right there. I see. I was there
[2:05:10] back in 3:25 when they started making
[2:05:12] rules.
[2:05:14] Back in 3:25 when the church started
[2:05:16] married into trinitarianism. That's when
[2:05:19] they started calling me a heretic.
[2:05:25] Do you know prior to 3:25 ADH that it
[2:05:30] was the pagans that were killing
[2:05:31] Christians?
[2:05:33] But after 3:25 AD, just a few years
[2:05:36] later, they they they put the edict of
[2:05:39] Thessalonica and they wrote it, I think
[2:05:41] it was in 3:13, just a few years later.
[2:05:44] And they said every person that's not
[2:05:46] baptized in the trinitarian doctrine of
[2:05:48] the Nian church would be called a
[2:05:50] heretic and would die because of their
[2:05:53] heathenism.
[2:05:56] And by the year of 380 they made it
[2:05:58] outlawed anybody that worshiped any
[2:06:01] other way than the way of the na council
[2:06:03] called the Roman mother church.
[2:06:06] Come on now. And they persecuted. Now it
[2:06:09] wasn't the pagan. It was now what was
[2:06:11] called Christianity. But from the time
[2:06:14] of 380 AD all the way to the 1500s, it
[2:06:18] was the Roman chlet church that did it.
[2:06:20] But brother, about 1500s, she had
[2:06:23] babies and Luther was born and Wesley
[2:06:27] was born and the Baptist was born. Do
[2:06:30] you know something powerful, brother? Do
[2:06:31] you know when it was born in Revelations
[2:06:33] 13? Amen. When the second beast starts
[2:06:35] coming up out of the land, that was
[2:06:37] America at Plymouth Rock. And it was in
[2:06:40] 1496 of course when when when Columbus
[2:06:42] came, but it was in the mid 1500s when
[2:06:45] they settled Jamestown. And almost
[2:06:47] within years, the same time America was
[2:06:50] settled, the Lutheran church was
[2:06:52] organized in Germany because the
[2:06:54] daughters would come up
[2:06:56] out of
[2:07:00] You missing what I'm saying? That was
[2:07:02] the day I become a heretic. That's why
[2:07:04] the Baptist don't want nothing to do
[2:07:05] with the message. That's why the
[2:07:07] Lutheran don't want nothing to do with
[2:07:08] the message because they're daughters of
[2:07:11] that of Revelation 17. And they
[2:07:14] have come against the divine word of God
[2:07:16] and called us a bunch of heretics. Well,
[2:07:19] let me tell you this. I am like Apostle
[2:07:21] Paul in the way of
[2:07:25] heresy. I worship the Lord God our
[2:07:27] father.
[2:07:28] [Applause]
[2:07:31] And brother, I was there when Luther got
[2:07:34] mad and preached the reformation. And I
[2:07:36] was there when Wesley stood up. And I
[2:07:38] was there when 1906 when Seymour started
[2:07:40] speaking in tongues and the gifts begin
[2:07:42] to move in the church.
[2:07:44] But I didn't stay there.
[2:07:47] See, that's why I don't identify as a
[2:07:49] Lutheran because the pillar of fire,
[2:07:51] which I'm a part of, it moved through
[2:07:54] the
[2:07:56] Lutheran. And what was left was the
[2:07:58] Lutheran denomination. But I don't
[2:08:00] identify as a Lutheran. I'm a part of
[2:08:03] that pillar of fire. And it moved on to
[2:08:05] sanctification. And it moved on to the
[2:08:08] Holy Ghost. And it moved on to the
[2:08:10] adoption of sons under the message of
[2:08:13] William Brham. And brother, I I was
[2:08:16] there when little little light came in a
[2:08:20] room down there in Jeffersonville, just
[2:08:22] across the river in Kentucky. I was
[2:08:25] right there in 1909 on April the 6th.
[2:08:27] And I was there when he seen a vision of
[2:08:29] a bridge falling. Somebody said, "The
[2:08:31] bridge didn't fall." It did. I was
[2:08:33] there.
[2:08:34] [Music]
[2:08:36] I was there.
[2:08:39] Sure. I was there when the flood
[2:08:40] happened. I was there when brother Bam's
[2:08:43] baby died. I was right there.
[2:08:47] I was right there when that angel
[2:08:48] appeared to him in 47 and sent this
[2:08:50] message into St. Louis. And the second
[2:08:53] place it hit was Jonesboro, Arkansas,
[2:08:55] within 35 miles of where I lived. You
[2:08:58] don't think God didn't have some seed
[2:09:00] down in Jonesboro, Arkansas? and my
[2:09:03] great grand or my my wife's grandmother
[2:09:05] and granddad and my granddad and half of
[2:09:08] our family was in them meetings in 47
[2:09:10] and in the 50s. Amen. And they come home
[2:09:13] telling us God has sent a prophet in
[2:09:15] this generation and brother I was there.
[2:09:22] But that pillar of fire just kept moving
[2:09:25] and it appeared in Sam Houston Coliseum.
[2:09:28] [Applause]
[2:09:30] Oh.
[2:09:32] Put the cameras over here, brothers.
[2:09:35] I know. I know the devil don't like this
[2:09:37] one.
[2:09:40] But I want y'all to know something. I
[2:09:43] didn't take that picture.
[2:09:45] Brother Steven didn't take the picture.
[2:09:48] There wasn't any Brandham followers took
[2:09:50] that picture. It was the critics of
[2:09:53] divine healing that took that
[2:09:55] [Applause]
[2:09:57] picture. You know what that is? That's
[2:10:00] like picking up the sword out of
[2:10:01] Goliath's hand and cutting his head off
[2:10:03] with it. And God has given you this
[2:10:06] picture to tell every devil out of hell.
[2:10:08] We are identified with the one that
[2:10:11] wrote this Bible. We're identified with
[2:10:13] the God that created the heavens and the
[2:10:15] earth, we are not just a church.
[2:10:19] We're not man followers. Get that out of
[2:10:22] your mind.
[2:10:25] I could take you to the date wherever
[2:10:27] church started. It's in history. I've
[2:10:28] been reading all about it, but you can't
[2:10:30] show me the date this started
[2:10:34] because that pillar fire was active
[2:10:35] before brother Brandham came. But it
[2:10:37] just kept leading us and kept leading
[2:10:39] us. And brother Bam said, "There's more
[2:10:41] for you." And he led us into the opening
[2:10:43] of the seals. That's why I was there
[2:10:45] when this cloud appeared in sunset,
[2:10:48] Arizona. I was there.
[2:10:52] I was there.
[2:10:54] I identify that is my headship.
[2:10:58] And I'm not going to let no weak need,
[2:11:01] sire down, watered down preacher or
[2:11:03] devil or anything else take that out of
[2:11:05] my hands.
[2:11:09] You can kill me, but you can't take away
[2:11:11] what God gave me.
[2:11:15] And I don't know what that is because
[2:11:17] somebody told me God revealed to me what
[2:11:19] happened in
[2:11:23] that Amen.
[2:11:26] [Applause]
[2:11:28] Amen.
[2:11:32] You don't have to take this. Preacher,
[2:11:35] my brother. Amen. But when Brother
[2:11:37] Brandham was caught up in that, I
[2:11:40] believe that. Somebody said, "Brother
[2:11:42] Wayne, what's the seven seal? What's the
[2:11:44] seventh seal? What's the seven seal?" I
[2:11:46] can show you a direct quote. And brother
[2:11:48] Bram said, "There were seven angels in
[2:11:50] that consolation." That's right. But
[2:11:52] that one that had that seventh message.
[2:11:56] The messenger of the seventh seal.
[2:12:00] He said that's the seventh seal. He came
[2:12:04] to me
[2:12:05] [Applause]
[2:12:07] who held the seals who held the book.
[2:12:11] Come on, church. What is the seven seal?
[2:12:13] It was that angel of the covenant coming
[2:12:16] to William Brandom with the opening of
[2:12:18] the word to lift this bride.
[2:12:26] That's why I'm identified right here.
[2:12:28] And that's why I didn't stop with what
[2:12:30] he said in ' 63, but I went on to 65 and
[2:12:33] saw him turn that picture and say it
[2:12:35] wasn't just angels, but the Lord was up
[2:12:38] there. See his eyes, see his face,
[2:12:40] seeing pardon the sinner.
[2:12:43] I was right there. But brother, when
[2:12:46] they buried that prophet in that tomb,
[2:12:48] that God didn't stop. No sir. And what a
[2:12:53] what a tragedy that many people identify
[2:12:55] only to that place. But that prophet
[2:12:58] introduced us to one before he left. And
[2:13:01] he said, "I have been a burning and
[2:13:03] bright light for a season. But I am not
[2:13:05] he, but I am here to declare he is
[2:13:08] here."
[2:13:10] And let me say this, he is still here.
[2:13:13] King Theophony is still with the church
[2:13:16] of the living God.
[2:13:19] Let him influence you. Let him influence
[2:13:22] your thoughts. Let him influence your
[2:13:23] mind.
[2:13:25] Let him influence everything. God bless
[2:13:27] you. Stand to your feet with me tonight.
[2:13:29] Let him influence you. Let this message.
[2:13:32] It's this message is not it's not the
[2:13:34] influence of brother Steven or Wayne
[2:13:36] Lawson or
[2:13:38] sir. No sir. It's the influence
[2:13:44] of King Theophony.
[2:13:47] [Music]
[2:13:49] crystal clear revelation.
[2:13:52] You remember when it was so foggy?
[2:13:54] Remember years ago when it was so foggy
[2:13:58] and then watch it started clearing
[2:14:01] Yes, sir. And the men used to be able to
[2:14:03] say, "Well, it could be maybe." But all
[2:14:04] of a sudden, men of God started getting
[2:14:06] clarity on
[2:14:10] they started saying, "It's this. It's
[2:14:13] this."
[2:14:16] And with it become the revelation. Begin
[2:14:18] to lift the people.
[2:14:22] Begin to begin to lift them. Hallelujah.
[2:14:24] And I believe tonight the influence of
[2:14:26] this message can lift you. That's right.
[2:14:30] It can lift you, friend. It lift you out
[2:14:31] of problems. Lift you out of your
[2:14:33] troubles.
[2:14:36] Whatever you're in tonight, listen, this
[2:14:37] message is lifting power.
[2:14:42] Glory to God. Amen. I I've been studying
[2:14:44] I've been studying the seals pretty
[2:14:46] deeply lately. And in third seal,
[2:14:48] brother Bram comes up through there and
[2:14:49] he says something real clearly. He said,
[2:14:51] "The word become incarnate, the things
[2:14:53] of Isaiah D." And he said, "The
[2:14:56] disciples even missed it."
[2:15:01] Remember it. They said, "We thought
[2:15:03] Elijah must first come." He said, "Even
[2:15:05] the disciples missed it." He said the
[2:15:08] Pharisees, he said they all missed it.
[2:15:10] The Bible said he came into the world.
[2:15:12] the world knew him not.
[2:15:15] Remember and then brother Brandham turns
[2:15:16] around and he says, "You say, Brother
[2:15:19] Brandham, then what's the reason that we
[2:15:22] would continue if people miss it?"
[2:15:26] Because you know that first coming
[2:15:28] wasn't even promised to be a secret.
[2:15:32] There's no promise the first coming was
[2:15:33] a secret at all.
[2:15:36] But the second
[2:15:38] but the second would be a secret.
[2:15:44] Hallelujah. And they all missed it. And
[2:15:47] brother Bam said, "You say them, why
[2:15:48] should I try?" He said, "Let me tell you
[2:15:51] this is the kind of faith you ought to
[2:15:53] have."
[2:15:55] Now you know preaching saves the lost.
[2:15:56] You know that. But brother Brandham
[2:15:59] said, "But his teaching, that's it,
[2:16:00] brother. Will positionally place the
[2:16:03] bride.
[2:16:04] [Applause]
[2:16:05] And he said, "Until you positionally
[2:16:07] know who you are, you will never have
[2:16:10] the right kind of faith.
[2:16:15] The right kind."
[2:16:18] And he said, "This is what I want you to
[2:16:19] remember. You want to have this kind of
[2:16:22] faith. If there's only one going,
[2:16:26] it's me.
[2:16:28] [Applause]
[2:16:28] [Music]
[2:16:30] If there's just one, I'm the one." He
[2:16:32] said, "If you don't remember it like
[2:16:34] that, there's something wrong with you."
[2:16:39] So, you just tell them. Say, "I don't
[2:16:40] know who's going, but I know I am."
[2:16:44] That's the right kind of faith.
[2:16:47] That's the right kind of faith. Let's
[2:16:49] bow our hearts. Almighty God, we thank
[2:16:50] you tonight. We thank you for this
[2:16:53] lovely congregation, Father. We thank
[2:16:55] you for the liberty on your word. We ask

[2:17:08] here, Lord. We pray that you bless them.
[2:17:11] May you bless their efforts, Lord. May
[2:17:13] you give them fruit for their labors.
[2:17:15] And Father, I pray tonight that the the
[2:17:18] word of life that has been spoken, may
[2:17:19] it have an influence, Lord. Yes, Lord.

[2:17:24] the influence of your word would lead
[2:17:27] them to higher heights,
[2:17:29] to a security of faith, Lord, that would

[2:17:35] Father, I pray tonight that you would
[2:17:36] lead them, you would give them the
[2:17:38] desires they have need of. Father, if
[2:17:40] there's one
[2:17:41] tonight, maybe they have maybe they're
[2:17:44] tripped up a little bit. I pray, Father,
[2:17:47] you help them tonight to learn how to
[2:17:48] walk it off. Amen. I pray they get up
[2:17:51] and just go back to walking.
[2:17:53] Let them get up and dust off, Lord, like
[2:17:55] your prophet said. Let us get right back
[2:17:58] up and get to doing. I ask you tonight
[2:18:00] that you would help them, Lord. Touch
[2:18:02] the young people, Lord. Give them grace
[2:18:04] tonight. Now, we commit this service
[2:18:07] into thy faithful hands. In the name of
[2:18:09] Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. And amen.
[2:18:13] God bless you, my friends.
[2:18:24] [Music]
[2:18:43] I love you, Lord.

[2:18:52] me. And all my
