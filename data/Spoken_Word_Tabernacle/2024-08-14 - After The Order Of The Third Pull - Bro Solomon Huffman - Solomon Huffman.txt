life on Sund as a special is that okay because stuff that are there it's prophetic Oh Glory to God next time sister uh L sing I I God is greater you got to back up and if God is so somebody need to

okay something happened to my voice amen oh my remember brother the James bent it's sent uh from Sister AB CH me invisible audience so just remember maybe at the end of the service we just pray for the request so that the Lord will touch I don't know what's going on but he will send through the streaming chat we greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Jesus Christ and uh thank you for your responses we have a robust response for the marriage couple don't worry we planning on good things we're going to make it like a banquet is that a problem uh I will announce it on Sunday Lord's willing okay we we we we working on that amen amen for some reason oh God if you see what the holy spirit is unfolding my mind I can't even scripture I read before and then I'm sitting as soon as I begin to just meditate on that and he keept coming up so I don't even know if one day 3 hours will be even sured because of the material that is coming and it's coming up with scripture with scripture with scripture with and I was coming uh toward work and the Holy Spirit through my wife gave me a quote I usually say that without a qut and he brought BR on Boo's eyes with a quot straight like my God boy you going to be in [Laughter] trouble amen amen no he's going to make our marriages better in sweeten don't worry oh goodness I won't give you that code if I give it to you somebody will run quickly like hands up oh oh my I was sitting in the office there taking the coat and putting that quickly before he crosses my mind because any time it's coming sometime it's at 2: am. and I'm sitting after 2: am I got to wake up in the morning and things continue to come then I have to stop and open up and go ahead and keep putting it putting it's amazing God this message got everything there is nothing that is not in this message we just didn't have time to sit there and to dig the prophet lay everything in the message amen there is no aspect in our life where the Holy Spirit cannot touch there is everything in our life maybe it doesn't have your vocabulary but if you look in a certain way because the scripture doesn't have every vocabulary we're using today but it doesn't mean that the scripture doesn't haveen when they say that the Antichrist will bring fire from I mean down from heaven you saw fire coming down from heaven that's a Pentecostal understanding our understanding is Aton atomic bomb so if you're looking for atomic bomb you won't see it that way you have to understand how can fire come down from heaven it was atomic bomb so all of this if you look at the war of Israel and amas it's sitting right there in the scripture you have to know how to decode the scripture and the only perfect interpretation of the scripture today is nothing else but the message of William Marion BR amen I'm not preaching it a convention convention meaning I take a break and then I'm sitting and we pass the ball and let somebody else score so we got brother Solomon Hoffman amen you already heard the anointing coming up so you know what is coming up so I told him I said the people love you you at home he came he opened the the the door I say perfectly like somebody who's at home that's what you do so he's at home his wife is there baby there welcome again sister you not in another church when you here it's a second home so everybody love you we welcome you and we love the ministry and we are expecting great things tonight because the Lord has been doing good things I was with brother Benjamin last night sitting he ate a big [Applause] meal and he even wanted to be in service tonight so I don't know what happened I told him I said if you can go to the hospital you can go to church you can come to church amen so I don't know what happened maybe he's resting or something like that when you don't feel good you don't stay home come to church amen because the church is like a hospital when you get there you don't leave the same and if and if you come with faith then you're going to leave completely different and the Holy Spirit Will anoint you and God will deliver you amen so let's pull on the gift of God and go with only believe [Music] amen believe all things are possible only [Music] All Things Are [Music] let's just sing that Jesus is here Jesus is Jesus is here all things are Jesus is Jesus is Jesus is here all are Jesus is amen you believe he's here tonight amen we believe that that's a promise and when We Gather in his name he'll be there in the midst and we believe that with all of our hearts amen how many's happy to be in church on a Wednesday night amen thank the Lord for his grace and mercy to be in his house one more time and I know this is our convention night here on on a Wednesday night o tolder the Shango said I don't think this is a Wednesday night prayer meeting I think it's Wednesday night convention so we find that's just about the truth here and uh we know you folks love the word here as we do and uh we're all fellowshipping around uh the same message and I believe it's going to produce Rapture in faith and one of these days our bodies will be changed and we believe that with all of our hearts and we're just fighting the battle and pressing on until that day is here and uh we just want to go to the Lord in a lord in a word of prayer before we look to the word and uh maybe just humble ourselves before him before we look at some things here if you have a need upon your heart just ask God to speak to you and minister to you tonight and uh the prophet Tau us he said if we we leave disappointed it's not because God disappointed us but it's because that we didn't come expecting so let's just expect the Lord to speak to us and move and and I believe he'll do exactly what we expect him to so let's just all pray together Lord Lord we're so honored to be in your presence here tonight and Lord we have f moving of your spirit Lord as the songs of Zion have been sung Lord is to create an atmosphere that your spirit would be welcome Lord and Lord We Know It prepares the way for the word it calms our spirit Lord and it it just makes it to where we can hear your voice a little more clearer Lord and we thank you Lord that you're here in our midst Lord and what a Divine appointment this is Lord every person that's here is not here by chance Lord but they're here by the predestination of almighty God and you know know the things that they have need of Lord you know the needs upon their hearts Lord the things Lord that may be going on in their life the questions they may have on their mind Lord and no matter what the need is we confess there's not a need That's too great that you can't minister to Lord there's not a wall too great that you can't break down there's not a sickness too great that you can't heal Lord there's not a demon power too strong that you're not able to conquer and Lord we believe you're the mighty conqueror and we just invite you to come into this meeting tonight Lord help me to surrender to you and to get myself out of your way Lord the only gift I have is to get out of your way and I'm asking for your help Lord you'll help me to do that tonight Lord and may you take your word and open it to us Lord and break the bread of life to us like only you can Lord and we'll be sure to give you all the glory and the honor and praise and for anything that's accomplished Lord we'll be sure to give you the glory for it it's in the Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and the church said amen amen may God bless you tonight uh if you have your Bibles uh we invite you to turn in the scripture in the Book of Revelation uh the 10th chapter and uh we also want to read in Hebrews 6 as you're turning there we just greet you tonight in the name of the Lord and uh always a great great honor to be here with you and we certainly have a lot of respect for your pastor brother Steven and his stand on the word of God and uh it's just nice being able to preach and not worry about somebody stands you uh you know that this church believes the message and uh and that right there is just good enough to show you amen you believe the word of God and we do and uh we we don't have to worry about crossing any doctrines or ideas but uh we're so thankful for that and it's created such a liberty for the the spirit of God to move and and God blesses that and uh so we just appreciate this church very much and we bring you greetings from our pastor brother Josh Bennett and the church over in Newton we want to be sure and greet you here and I'm glad to have my wife and baby here there're somewhere probably in the back I sure appreciate her making a sacrifice to be here also uh let's read here uh in Revelation 10 and very familiar scripture uh to us but very powerful uh Revelation 101 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and and there's so many quotes you could go to there in just that verse but the prophet said only Christ could have been we know that Christ was that Mighty angel that came down and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth now we know the only one that was worthy to open book to open the book was the lamb that's right so if he had the little book opened then it must have been in the lamb which was the mighty Angel he was the only one worthy to open the word and he cried with a loud voice as when the lion Roth and when he cried seven Thunders uttered their voices when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to ride and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me SE up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and sore by him that liveth forever and ever who created Heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the Sea and the things that there that are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he ha declared to his servants the prophets notice this scripture here in the E verse and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings let's turn also in Hebrews 6 19 and the 20th verse Hebrews 619 yes sir the Bible reads this which hope we have as an anchor of the Soul both sure and steadfast and which entereth into that within the veil sir and whether the Forerunner is for us entered even Jesus made an high priest Forever After the order of man after the order of a Preacher after the order of MDC we know that was God God himself amen we just ask that God will bless his word and help us now as you take uh your seats tonight and uh want to speak to you on a after the order of the third pool amen after the order of the third pool and amen how many believes that God he's a god of order we all believe that God sir God is a god of order he does things in order and amen and the prophet would talk about um how and we'll just get really simple in this and build somewhat of a foundation but we know very clearly that the third pool was the opening of the word we all believe that here one ones at the end time the prophet would say this he said but the only way the prophet can be Vindicated is by the word now not signs not wonders not Miracles but by the word yes sir and remember he said the third pool was the opening of them seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word he says do you see it yes sir do you see it and we know that it was the opening of the word that would actually wake the bride up as that right amen you'll find there in the third seal that the prophet would say that the bride has not had a Revival yet isn't that right he's here in the third s and says that the bride has not had a Revival yet that she's still sleeping now it's amazing that the prophet begins to say that because you've got all of these messages and all of these uh tapes that are recorded and and the prophet says there's not been a Revival yet for the bride now and the churches had the Revival denominations had their Revival all of these things had their Revival he said but the bride there has not been a Revival for he said there's been no Revival there he said there's been no manifestation of God to stir the bride he said now we're looking for it now he said it'll take those seven unknown Thunders back there to wake her up again he said he'll send it he promised now watch and of course in the church age book The Prophet said that the messenger of Malachi 4 in Revelation 10:7 that he's going to do two he one according to Malachi 4 he'll turn the hearts of the children to the fathers and two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals amen so in simple words the seven Thunders it is the revelation of the Seven Seals and that is what caught your attention that that is what woke the bride up listen emotionalism didn't wake the bride up Pentecostalism didn't wake the bride up amen music did not wake the bride up SS and wonders did not wake the bride up sir listen friends our Revival is not centered around signs and wonders and it's not even centered around how amen the prophet had a gift of discernment he had the sign in the hand it's not centered around that our Revival is a word Revival and our Revival is based solemnly upon the word that's exactly the right I tell you this the order of Revival it was started around the word of almighty God that's exactly amen of course we know it's the opening of the word that brought the church and put it back in order amen that's exactly right it was the opening of the word that put us back in order I think it's amazing you know that that that brother brandham he would put worship back in order but but you never find William brandham taking the shout out of the church yeah it's so amazing how you find him do things as a prophet that he would put so much in order but he didn't have to take things away all he did was put what you had in order let me tell you I I tell you church it's m that has took things out of the church the prophet never took it out he put it in order yes sir take your he put it in order he didn't take it out listen the prophet didn't take joy out of the church it was man that put joy out of the church the prophet did not take the gifts of the Spirit out of the church it was man that took it out of the church and said we don't need that anymore let me say this I think we ought to get back to the Vindicated order that God forward by the ministry of Malachi 4 if God put it in order we ought to let it stay in order because if a prophet put it in order then it's in the right order that's right glory to God that's exactly right amen he put the gifts of the Spirit in order but he didn't have to remove them to put them in order man I know people get so up on that because they think the prophet he preached against speaking in tongu I'll tell you what he preached against he preached against it being out of order that's right he preached against it being out of order but he did not take it out of the church you show me one place where he did it we'll talk about it he didn't take it out of the church he put it in order yes sir so that God would be pleased with the gifts that he gave us right amen it was the opening of the word that put marriage and divorce back in order exactly I know a popular it's the truth this message put every single say back in order it put how we dress back in order and put how we live back in order and put how we talk back in order listen if you're out of order tonight because you want to be that's right amen God sent us a prophet to put us back in order yes my brother hey if the church is out of order it's because they've adopted man's ideas instead of the Vindicated m message of the hour yes sir listen this bride is not out of order this bride is in order glory to God Amen I think it's horrible what men has done amen people that theyve took worship out of the church they took emotion out of the church that they stripped all of these things that you and I I don't know about yall but I enjoy worshiping the Lord I enjoy singing to the Lord and you take people say we don't need that no more and we don't need that no more that's not what the prophet said and he didn't put that in order you made your own order that's exactly right take your time my brother amen people say well you know we we got to be careful around this and we got to be careful around that because we'll get out of order we got to be careful around the motion and careful around this because we'll get out of order Heen you know you always hear about it in that manner that somebody gets emotional that's out of order what if I preach up this way what about you being a High starchy cold believer pre I'll tell you what that's just as out of order amen as the person just climbing up to sh if you want to be out of order let's preach about it for a moment I think it's time that we let face some FS siren if you're dry and starchy and cold that's out of order in the church that's right if you don't got no joy in your heart that's out of order if you got depression and sadness and this order if you don't love to come into you don't love to come to the house of God and worship God that's out of order preach my brother Heen we want to always take it to one side and say emotionalism is out of order shoutings out of order using so many quotes that's out of order using so many scripture that's out of order amen and all these folks want to make all of this out of order well how about you put it on their side and say well your intellectualism is out of order cuz you got all word and you got no Spirit you got all mechanics and you got no Dynamics listen brother the order is in the middle of the road right that's where the blessings are that's where the power of God is yes sir yes in the middle of the road is where the Prophet put order glory to God he man what the prophet say he saw you and I previewed right yes sir he saw the preview of that bride that would come out of the leosan church age and she was starting to get out of order and one that Prophet say get back in line get back in order and if there was ever time that you and I get back in line it is right now if there was ever a time that order ought to be in the house of God it is right now to God that's exactly right people want Revival and people want all these things but they don't want to get in order that's it that's it problem where our reval is centered around it's around order that's exactly right that's exactly right take your time the prophet say he said Revival is not adding to the church it's not more members and more this and more that he said it's a stirring up of what you've already got there yall know the story he said I was looking out there in the lake and saw that Lake just rushing back and forth that's right he said it hit me there's not a single more drop of water than there was before it was beginning to be stirred up he said what was it it was being stirred up and all the trust was getting out and the water was getting back in order that's right amen the water signifies people right I think this time there's a stirring of the water and we get the trash out of the house of God we get the trash out of our lives and say God get the trash out and put us back in order glory to God your time brother exactly the truth you'll find Elijah when he's rebuilding the altar when when the altar was broken down in the Old Testament it wasn't until the altar was rebuilt and everything was put in order yes sir everything was put in order and then the fire fell when order was restored back to the altar listen you find Revival brother sister when you get back in line with the word of God and God sent us this word to put us back in order and to get the church back in line yes my brother take your time exactly the truth you see that scripture there in in Hebrews 6 and 20 that Christ was after the order of mezc can you you take that word order it's very powerful in the Greek because order it means the arranging the arrangement in other words he was of the arrangement of mzc in other words a position he was under the position of MDC sir now listen it's amazing when you see this because amen Jesus was put in order he was after the order of the will of the father now now we know that God does things in order God is not a God that's out of order amen and the greater than Solomon is here the prophet said you'll find that God is a god of order always he's a god of order and he does all things in order and he does all things well sir I like what they testified about Christ there in Mark 7:37 he said they were beyond measure they were Beyond measured astonish saying he has done all things well that's right he's done all things good he's done all things well he maketh both to death to hear and the dumb to speak so so we know very clearly there's a right order and there's a wrong order that's exact amen and I believe that when God sets things in order that they are in order that's exact when put the church in order it was in order that's right when man gets his hands in it it's when it gets out of order let me say this when you get your hands on your life and you're calling all your decisions that's when you get out of order and your life gets all messed up when you're the one controlling everything you do but Christ has no way to have prance in you because you think you know the best but let me tell you something you don't know the best thing for you but God does know the best thing for yes my brother yes sir amen the right order is when God puts the church in order that's right tell you friends the church should not be a church out of order but we should be a church in order exactly right God sent us essages to tie up the lucans not not to make us guessing and wondering and guessing well watch in order watch out of order what listen we're not guessing these things no more we know what the truth of God's word is is we're not guessing around is this right is this wrong is this listen people that do let me just preach for a moment people that are always trying to find is something okay that somebody that they're wanting to serve sin instead of serving God they're trying to find can I get away with his can you've been asking these questions for years amen ain't it time we stop asking the silly questions well it's doing this wrong and it's doing this wrong if the prophet said it was wrong 50 years ago and is still wrong today Prophet said it was no matter how many years ago the truth don't change it is man that changes that's exactly right preach my brother exactly right take your time amen he put it in order yes sir he put it in order look at Jesus in the New Testament he was he was after the order of mzc and we know that Jesus he only did the will of the father that's exactly right what he say he said not my will but your will be done you find Jesus here in 5:19 he said and answered Jesus and said unto them verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he sees the father do for whatsoever things he doeth these also doeth the son likewise yes my brother Everything Jesus would do the places that he went he would do it because he saw the father do it amen now how many knows amen for sure that Jesus was after the order of MDC yes sir and the things that he did he would actually do them by vision amen the message Be not Afraid the prophet said any Bible student they know that there in John 5:19 Jesus never performed one miracle in his life without first God the Father showing him a vision to do it what what was it Jesus was so in order said I'm only going to do it if I see the father do it first yes and he would show him a vision of what to do and where to go sometimes it be Samaria amen sometimes it be to a well with just one woman but God would show him by vision and Jesus would obey the will of the father Yes my brother take your time take your time my brother so we know that God brings order by visions he gave Jesus Visions amen prophets of the Old Testament he give them Visions to uh to show them the order that he'd have and we know that God brings order by his word yes my brother isn't that right by the power of His word God sets things in order amen you find it verse simply there in Genesis 1 that the Earth was without form and it was void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved on the face of the water listen the Earth this Earth used to be very very ugly and darkness was on the face just like you and I just like our lives right Darkness was a face of the deep everything was a mess everything was wct everything was upside down and then God said let there be life and God sent his word out and every s God in order Hallelujah every s God in order the darkness went and The Light Came because the light put out the darkness listen church it was by the power of the spoken word that God s this Earth back in order yes sir brother he put it in order by the power of the spoken word yes my brother amen excuse me he put the word the world in order by the power of His spoken word that's exactly right amen the prophet said is in the message Masterpiece he said it took him two it took him 4,000 years to make this masterpiece now and he's been nearly 2,000 years making another Masterpiece a bride for Christ yes sir another Masterpiece he said in so he does it by his never changing method sir the same way he made the Masterpiece his word is the way he'll make this masterpiece because he'll be using his perfect Masterpiece he said it can only be a perfect Masterpiece when it is the perfect word word that's right brother said that that's the way that God does it is by his word it's his never changing method to use his word to create a masterpiece and he used his word to bring order upon the face of this Earth that's right take your time listen if my God could bring order to the face of this Earth this whole entire Globe what makes you think that God can't bring order to your life and to my life and to the church to the Living God that God can bring order to this whole earth he can bring order to your life yes my he still the god that say peace be still and bring order where there is chaos that is the god that we serve of order and just one word from him he can put it all back in order if darkness is over your life God can say let there be life amen if sickness is upon your life God can say Let There be healing Devils have to depart you by the power of His word God can change it by the power of His word that's exactly right amen how does God give us his word by a prophet right God gives us his word by a prophet remember in Exodus 20 amen that the people the children of Israel they saw all the thunderings and Lightnings and the noise of the trumpet and the mountain smoking and they said to Moses Moses you speak to us look at the mountain look and look at all the all the uh Supernatural that's up there and the children of Israel said Moses you speak unto us L we die the the voice of God it might kill us that's right and you find God institutes the way he speaks to his children all the way back here in Exodus 20 he's no longer coming down and speaking with his Audible Voice upon the mountain but now he begins to change the way he works and he said I won't speak to you that way no more but I'll do it by the prophets yes my brother I'll do it by the prophets in the Fe of the trumpets but said here in the prayers said merciful god Jehovah the almighty God that thundered on Mount Si that he said the people scream let Moses speak and not God least we die you said great Jehovah I'll raise them up a prophet I'll not speak to them like this no more he said and you promised that you would do this and you did yes my brother amen so if God's going to bring back order he's going to do it by his word sir and he's going to send a prophet to bring that word it's perfectly Amos 3:7 that surely the Lord God will do nothing unless he reveals it by his servants the prophets God brings his prophets amen and brings the church back in order by the ministry of a prophet exactly right you'll find at every Church age that God would have a message for that age amen am right Amen in time evangelism I'm trying to cover some ground so you give me some Grace in time evangelism He said Each age they had their own message and their messenger all through all time every age packed its own message with a messenger it was God in that dispensation he would send somebody Anointed with the Holy Spirit to bring forth his message for that age now you you'll go down and you study it out here in Revelation 2 that God would say unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus right and every single one of these scriptures you'll see God saying unto the angel unto the angel and God is sending out an angel but you'll find something very powerful here the prophet would teach us that God did not send prophets all the way through but it was a major prophet at the beginning and it was a major prophet at the ending of it they were not prophets all the way through that's exactly right they were only reformers amen amen amen I keep moving I'll just give this to the angel of the Church of Ephesus if yall want to take something that's very nice to study you find all of these different Church ages the different five times you read it here I'll just read it to you here in Ephesus unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus yes sir but then you read the rest of the church ages unto the angel of the church in samna you'll find it the wording is very phenomenal because you'll find in pergamus in samna but in Ephesus you'll find you'll find of instead of in you say well where else do you find it you find it in ephis and you find it Le to the angel of the church unto the angel of the you say why did God let it be written that way he wrote it that way brother sister to let you know at the beginning I'm going to send forth the word listen can I tell you something here tonight amen Paul laid the foundation and he did a very good job and laying the foundation but a in the end time this is not Foundation time this is Capstone time amen and God has s a prophet again not to start the bride but to finish the bride yes my brother take your time thank major prophet major prophet major prophet major prophet listen we're not gathered under a Reformation message we're gathered under a restoration message we're not here just reform Christians we are restored Christians everything that brother hallelujah we're not Reformed Church we a restore Church yes my brother take your time that's exactly right thank God did not listen friends God did not send reformers to bring perfect order Hallelujah they couldn't do it because they didn't have perfect word that's the truth you read about Lutheran Wesley these are people drinking alcohol call smoking cigars study it out you'll find it's the truth amen smoking cigar and doing all these things they were not word prophets bringing order to the church if you want to hold on to Luther's message you go ahead but God has moved on from that that you want to hold on to Wesley's message PR my brother listen brother sister you got to walk in the light as he is in the life you're not responsible for what God did a 100 years ago in a message of a day going by but you're responsible for the light of your age and for the message of your age take your time my brother exactly right take your time amen the prophet here in the first seal he said that the last message to the last Church age it's not a reformer no sir it's not a reformer he is a prophet not a reformer he said you show me one Prophet every start of the church age he said no he's not a reformer he's a prophet that's it others was reformers but not prophets he said if they would have been the word word of the Lord comes to the prophet he said and that's the reason they continued on and baptism and father son Holy Ghost and all these other things because they was reformers not prophets he said they was great men of God out there and they tore those things to Pieces but the full word of God never come to them because they were not prophets they were reformers and the prophet said but in the last days you have to be a prophet to take up the mysteries of God and bring it back because the mysteries of God is only known by the prophets yes my brother yes sir that's exactly the truth amen it's only known by the prophet it's amazing as God would give every individual Church H their own message the prophet would teach about them for anointings that's right God would anoint them to believe what he had given them that's right and he would give them the grace to live the message of their a I want you to hear me he would anoint them with the spirit of a lion he would anoint them with the spirit of book of Mars you look at these people brother sister and they're here on a cross and they're being nailed up there burn at the steak singing Hy I wonder brother sister amen could you say how could they stand on the cross there and they're underneath of flame they're underneath of flame and they're just singing amen H worship songs and praise song it's because God relased in a anointing along with that message and anointed them to live the message for their keep moving my brother it anointed them to live the message for their age amen listen church people want to raise up now say listen you you you can't preach these things to the young people you you can't preach Holiness to the church and you can't preach the supernat to the church because you it'll be a pressure on the people amen let me tell you this brother sister amen you anointed to live the message of the hour I don't care how you feel I don't care what it looks like God has anointed you to live this word I'm telling you there's a bride in the hand and she can live this message and she will live this message how can she do it because she's anointed to yes my brother yes my brother you say h how can y'all live above sin I'm anointed to do how you live aniet I'm anointed to do how could you live above fear that God's release the anointing yes my brother Len it's not a l anointing it's not it's not a man anointing it's an eagle anointing that God has released upon the church yes we can go high then we got wi and the grace and Riches of God we can go deeper than we ever wish you said well you said well I want the anointing of a lion I don't I want the anointing of an ox I don't listen that they ain't going around killing Christians in the US right now are they I don't think so but I'll tell you what there's a bunch of devils brother and sister and they are battling you and I every single day I don't need to have the anointing of a sacrificial Beast cuz they ain't trying to kill me and put me on a cross but I tell you what I do need because in this atmosphere in this Cosmos it's depression it is nervous it is fear it is anxiety I say God's release an [Applause] anointing yes sir you can go up high than where the devil is you can go up high that where the you PR Hallelujah you can go up higher than where you are you see well how can we do it because God's anointed us to do it yes my brother than let me appreciate here for a moment cuz I know what the devil does well well you you look at the mistakes you make and you look at this and you look at this and you look at all this the devil's trying to get you to live down here and he wants to tell the preachers Don't Preach against sin Don't Preach against that you'll put a pressure on the people to come up higher than they actually are I think it's time we get a little pressure under eyes because I want to be higher than I am I say God put some pressure on the bride and they just get high than what we are put some pressure on us yes pre Glory Don't Preach these things you'll put pressure I I'm no smart man but I know what the prophet said he said what will that eagle do that eagle will that stir up that Nest right see you get so used to being comfortable and then you get all down in the it's because you're comfortable that's right and then a spirit Rises up preacher Don't You Preach against how I'm living preach now let's just preach for a moment preach my amen sometimes we'll sit in the house of God fold our arms kick back and relax you dare somebody to say something about it you dare the preacher to preach against it amen I think it's time we preach against amen the house of God is not a place from some dead formal cold sty religion devil if you want to challenge amen let's challenge it with the word of almighty God that's right y'all know what I'm talking about the devil's constantly pushing and pushing listen devil I'm after the order of the opening of the

cool down and cool off listen the devil's constantly pushing and pushing amen but your order is you stand right there as a strong Soldier and you do not be moved you say devil if you want to push and let's push if you want to why don't you push that devil back with the word of God you want to push and let's push yes my brother glory to God let me tell you you you got something to push with okay you you got something to push with you're not pushing on your own might you're not pushing on your own strength you realize what the Propet talked about Jesus when he was led away Into the Wilderness and he was as weak you think you've been weak you try fasting 40 days and 40 nights see how weak you get he was so weak there that's right and what did the prophet say Jesus showed us as an example right he didn't stand there with Supernatural power he just stood there with what the word of God is WR he was after the order mzc and he stood there using the word of God and said devil it is written yes sir you shall not temp the Lord your God I think it's time you raise and tell that Old Devil amen devil it is written greater is he that's in me than he that is in the world devil it is written I'm more than a conqueror through him that loved me devil it is written God is not giving me a spirit of fear but of love and power and a shound mind it is written Dev not by might but by my power sayith the Lord glory to God preach my Hallelujah take your time it is take your time take your time glory to God take your time exactly right use the word sir because I I know what it's like cuz your strength runs out brother a that right your strength runs out sometime that's why you got to use the word that's right that's why you got to use the word my brother amen listen church God has been building his church take your time my brother amen we have got a message to build us up yes sir listen I I want to just build this in here because this is not Noah's message amen the prophet would tell us very clear said you couldn't take Noah's message and try to give it to Moses no it wasn't their message and it wasn't applicable for that day let me tell you church this message is applicable for the day that you and I are living in amen amen amen amen this is not Luther's message this is not Wesley's message brother they could not handle the message that you and I have received because it was not time for it yet that's exactly right ammen if you can handle this ain't even restoration of the gifts at Pentecost we went even beyond that brother sister that's exactly what the prophet said he said notice here the life was in the husk in the star in the tassle amen he continues on he said that the life was in there justification made way for sanctification sanctification made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost itself yes my brother yes sir yes my brother the baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost itself GH but that's exactly what the prophet said here amen made way for the Holy Ghost itself he said to come right on down into Perfection back to the word again amen it's perfectly John 16:13 how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he shall lead you and guide you unto all truth amen listen brother and sister this message is that spirit this message is the spirit of Truth which has come which is none other than the mighty Angel himself in Revelation 10 the spirit of Truth is that Mighty Angel the spirit of Truth is the person of Christ amen amen amen amen amen amen that's exactly right that's exactly right the spirit of Truth is the message of the hour people say well you know I might get in trouble I'm just going to take some Liberty here and listen if you get the true baptism of the Holy Spirit it will eventually lead you to this message that's exactly right that's exactly right I make no apologies for that it's the spirit of truth that's exactly right it's the Holy Spirit eventually it will lead you to the message of the hour because he said I'll lead you to all truth am this message is all truth but you can take a drug addict on the street he gets filled with the Holy Ghost come to the message of the hour straight to the message that's exactly the truth yes my brother take your time my brother take your time the spirit of Truth is Christ amen he brings back all the word yes sir amen now listen I hope I'm not getting confused in this but Revelation 10 the prophet said was the mighty Angel yes sir amen which was Christ Christ is the spirit of Truth when the spirit of truth comes he'll lead you and guide you to all the truth am that's righten I want you to notice in the hand that you just give me some Grace as I slow through this but in his hand he amen he had in his hand a little book open yes my brother take youren as I said earlier Christ the lamb was the only one worthy to open that book and he's here with that book open amen here come the lamb that been slayed amen and he had the book open he tore off the seals and notice what I want you to notice because as you take this verse by verse you'll find that as John is speaking to the angel here right my brother take your time you'll find that immediately after re Revelation 10:7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound the mystery of God should be finished you find that that that John comes up to that angel are you with me on this John comes up to that angel and he takes the hand he takes he takes the book out of the hand of that angel that's exactly right and the angel he tells John take the book and eat the book that's exactly right now he's not asking John John if you want to pray John pray about it a little while see what you think about it no he says John take the book and eat the book take the book and eat a booken now now where did he get the book out of he got it out of the hand of the Angel that's exactly read now it's out of the hand of the mighty Angel like now now you read William brand him here because he he begins to break this open and shows you something here because he said at the time that this is happening that that that that the seals are open and he sends it back down to the Earth he said his seventh angel is on the earth that he's on the earth at that time that's right so but but I thought he got the hand I thought he got the book out of the hand of the Angel and that angel was cry now you see the son of man Ministry you see the ministry of Christ you see it displayed through the ministry of the seven angel amen amen amen amen amen amen amen amen take your time I tell you what I'll just go to the angel himself that ain't how God works remember Exodus remember Exodus 20 I I won't come to you that way no more I will use the ministry of I don't need no Prophet I Don't Need No Mess you need a prophet you need a prophet I I don't need God to send a prophet I don't this that's how God speak I friends I met folks like this I'll get it directly from God I don't need no Prophet you need that Propet ever heard that I'll get it directly from God himself I don't need no Prophet but you're fooling yourself I me you're fooling yourself God does nothing unless he reveals it to his servants the prophets it's the way that God speaks it's the method that God speaks it is the order in which God uses yes my brother now it's amazing as you as you study this out because the prophet said during the time of the opening of those seals that the seventh angel was upon the Earth am so where did a seventh grade Kentucky hillbilly get a message as perfect as this message is where'd he get it from amen I I pray you tell me where did he get it from he got it out of the same pillow of fire that Moses got his message out of amen Amen brother he got it out of the hand of the mighty Angel amen this is not some private interpretation this is this is the interpretation from God himself give unto the prophet and the prophet unto us amen amen amen amen hallelujah he said he sent it down to the Earth to his seventh angel to reveal it to his people he said there you are oh my what happened the screams the shouts the Hallelujah he said the anointed the power the glory the manifestation I brother sister you you've got to realize where this message came from where did our order come from we're after the order of the opening of the word but after the order straight from the Throne of God amen amen it's the order of God himself amen amen amen the prophet put us in order yes sir that's right yes sir am mean this message put us in order that's exactly listen what did this message do it come to bring us and build us up in the word of God that's why the prophet he didn't just take you to justification no no amen it was the restoration of all things he didn't just bring you to sanctification he didn't just bring you to Restoration of the gifts he brought you to the Holy Ghost the word of Truth itself that's right that's what the the church has been brought to yes my brother hallelujah amen and this is the only age it could have happened in that's right it's the only age it could have took place in that's you realize here tonight this is the only age Perfection could have came man stay right there stay the only age Perfection could have came and I want you to realize something because the prophet would draw that pyramid right statue of a perfect man when it started out it was really really big amen the borders was really big the corners was really big but as the ages went on it got more narrow and more narrow and more narrow I can hear I can hear the prophet say he says smaller in number but greater in power amen smaller in number but greater in power listen let me tell you here tonight this ain't just some emotional church this is the power ful church with the power of the Holy Ghost amen surging our yes sir yes sir this ain't just a this ain't just a a Faith Church or a patience Church listen brother we're at the top of the pyramid this is the age of perfection I say let us go unto Perfection Hallelujah glory to God Amen we're after the order of it yes my I I think it's powerful when you when you study this out here in Revelation because when John here gets the book out of his hand he says as the angel told him take the book and eat it amen John did not sit there and argue he did not sit there and debate he did not sit there and question well you know you know Mighty Angel that's a nice book you got right there I like this part but I don't like that part that's not what John did you know the prophet in one place there I believe amen early on the 50s or so he said that's exactly what happens in your mouth it's all sweet in your stomach it gets bitter that's exactly right amen the word of God Amen this flesh don't like coping with the word exactly right I don't know if y'all notic that I'm sure you have but this flesh it does not like cope at least mine don't it don't like coping with the word of God because when you pass it through the filter this flesh gets uncomfortable and this flesh gets I don't want to conform I don't want to but let me tell you brother sister your body it's going to C with this word but it's going to coat with the seed that's on the inside of you amen amen amen amen amen listen Church the bride is not here just wanting partial word sir I want perfect word we're not here just eating upon partial Mana we're eating on perfect Mana we're not eating on partial Revelation we're eating on perfect perfect Revelation amen amen amen amen John was not here being some picky Buffet eater I'll take this I'll take this I'll take this listen the bride is not that way and that is not her attitude if the angel says take the book and eat it you don't ask no questions you say give me the book give me the book I'll take listen you do not have to beg this bride you don't have to plead with this bride listen your pastor don't have to beg you to listen to the T he don't have to beg you to feed on the message of the [Applause] hour will you please please listen to this T take Bri says give me the book give me the Mana give me the book give me the [Music] Mana listen I I take I don't have to come to my pastor when I'm hungry I'm not doing away with Pastor don't amen don't don't don't take that and run with you but listen I eat on Sunday and I eat on Wednesday amen this morning I had a nice chicken McGriddle from McDonald's but tomorrow I'm going to be hungry listen tonight you may be eating brother who knows what you're getting from God tonight but tomorrow you're going to be hungry and tomorrow you're going to say man I'm a little weak right now I need some strength you don't have to come and call up brother shim and say brother
