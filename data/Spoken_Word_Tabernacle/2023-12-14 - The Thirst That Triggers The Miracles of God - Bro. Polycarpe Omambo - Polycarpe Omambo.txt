Cheryl in advance amen amen amen all right this is from brother Michael or March he said God bless your church I would like to thank the Lord for two things two things amen one for helping repair a leaking toilet I called plumbers and they were charging $300 but thank God for that amen that the Lord helped that leaking toilet amen the second one for healing and work meate I had requested the church to pray for he has been discharged to Rehabilitation glory be to our god amen amen amen we're going to call brother Michael up um to bless the Lord um after sister divine's testimony amen so we're going to invite sister Divine to give her testimony tonight amen God bless you Saints um I don't even know where to start um God is good um so I haven't been working consistently for since October and um because of that I had to basically rely on my credit card to you know pay gas and little stuff um so because of that reason my credit card well my loan on my credit card was over ,000 um so of course like already having student loans and not having consistent job is you know is stressful um so I was doing my best trying to pay my you know my loan little by little um but of course that didn't help because if I'm not working consistently I'm not able to pay my uh uh my loan and because every time I got paid I will you know focus on paying my bills um first and then because all my my all my money will be gone by paying my bills then I won't I didn't have money to pay my loans so you know with timing and your credit score and all that stuff it wasn't looking good right um so then um I worked Friday um Saturday for the family and then after that um the L lady she kind of wanted me just to you know to kind of be an assistant for her because her um child you know had special needs so then she had asked me to go to the store to buy like little bit of groceries and then she will compensate me back for the money um for the groceries so then I went to the grocery store I I've used my credit card and because I I knew that you know she was ging she would give me back the money and then when she gave me back the money I just you know automatically just put it back in my credit card you know so I won't you know just have even more money racking up so after that um so I paid off the money um directly after she um she she paid me back um and then as I was paying as I was paying back the money I looked at my credit um my credit uh I don't know what you call it not score but my uh not balance uh uh my okay I don't know what it's called but anyways I was my statements there you go so I was looking at my statements and it showed that you know I paid the minus 25 that that's basically the amount that was there so I paid that off and then I was just looking at my big B um um credit um credit loan that I own and I'm just like I was like Lord if only like you can do something because it was just stressful looking at that and knowing that you know of course I already had student loans um but I'm just looking at this big number that I kind of didn't expect to have you know um especially just by not working consistently and not being able to pay it off so then um I don't really recall what I did all I know is the next morning I was just randomly going through my well Spargo account and it is said minus so it overdraft um like over $1,000 and it showed that you know the $25 which was paid to my credit card but it also like it also it also basically um show the overdraft of basically almost all all the money that was in my credit card right so then I'm looking at this I'm like oh my goodness so I'm thinking like the bank is going to call me and be like what's going on why is your Bank overdraft over like almost over ,000 dollars or whatever but you know throughout the whole day I'm just like looking at it looking at it I'm just like Lord if only like you can create a paradox of this situation because I already know that I'm already basically struggling financially and I can't really pay back the money consistently so this was like um Sunday night Sunday night I just prayed that and then um I didn't really end up going to sleep until like 2: in the morning cuz my sleep schedule had messed up and I just went to sleep and I was just like thinking about the sister who um I know that she had she didn't have um any um any gas money you know to put gas on her car but she wanted to go to church and God you know basically provided an invisible type of gas for her to make it to church so I'm just thinking about all this stuff and I'm just like I just FR like God can you just create a situation for me just to kind of pin you know kind of point my finger on and knowing that you know you're with me so I went to sleep and then randomly I woke up I looked and it showed basically the amount that I had left in my account but it took off the whole a th000 plus dollars that was there and I was like okay this is confusing so the whole day I'm like keep looking I'm keep looking I went back to my credit card and it showed that the money was paid off so I only have like $300 left that I have to pay personally but I just want to thank God for taking this burden and I just kept singing and I kept testifying you know that Jesus dropped the charges and I don't know how he did it but I'm just happy that you know I don't have to pay over $1,000 on my loan anymore so amen amen and amen amen amen Jesus dropped the charges amen and we tap into that anointing all the bills all the charges that we have he's gonna drop all of them amen amen um we're GNA call brother Michael Mar to bring before the Lord um our testimony our um birthday coming up and then also remember continue to uh remember sister Christa in prayer amen that we have brother Enoch praise the Lord are you happy you're here I am too it's beautiful know even the things that God do to us like he has done it for sister Divine what an encouragement I know we come to see Jesus but I also like to come and see brothers and sisters okay see your face see you are your happiness you know me it helps me in the way all right so let's let's let's pray father thank you for the

Brother Kelly's home right right brother D amen so we might brother Kelly at 2:30 and make sure we finish our part so we can catch up with you on uh finances and make sure especially you are patriarch so I really have to drill this all the way all the way deep because the patriarch have together it the young sister need it because the scriptures say a wise woman build a home brother Bram even say the backbone of that Society it's motherhood and if motherhood is not corrected then the whole society is done it's a different way if you sit down and you study the message you will see many things that were taught wrong many thing that were taught wrong because people miss the prophet completely and when you begin to look in different view you will see that this message is beautiful it is everything it is correcting our life it's correcting our finances it corrects our marriages it correct our relationship our business there is no area in our life that the message cannot penetrate and restore it's a message of restoration there is nothing even if even and and and the beauty of the message it can go back to your old life and dig into it and pick up something there and pull it from there and come and fix what is present if you let the word soak in and you humble yourself before the word you wanted to say something briefly go ahead so last Sunday I need to do something in the hotel where we used to pray so I told my husband can you call the manager ask him how much you going to char us to do what we want to do my husband said no the one that was there when when we used to pray there is there no more there is some new people that are done over there so you just go talk to them ask them how much they're going to charge us to do what you want to do so I went there I explained to the lady we want to do this and this um we used to be here how much you going to charge for that the lady say you're going to get it for free so he said so she said even if you want to go use the room over there you can still use the room it's it's free so you can use the outside and the inside for free if you want to so I thank God for that so go back to my country that was the hotel I wanted to to go to to leave but since the wedding was in and another hotel my husband asked me to stay where the wedding would be so when it it came the time for my husband to pay to pay for my staying over there I called my sister I say okay my husband is about to pay for me she said oh no the your spot is taken there's no more no no more place for you here so you need to find and had a

need to something you heard the testimony I just say I need to reimburse everything amen glory to [Laughter] God Amen it's the Seed of Abraham sometime you will learn those kind of stuff uh let me call the preacher I'm not preaching tonight it feels so wonderful like brother Michel said you don't know where what we go through today especially me I get my battle and your battle and everybody's battle facing me so when I see you laughing and uh Happy it makes me relax and everything amen like I was hurting somebody whining I said man you know what I should have taken an ice cream and hear

is people of like Precious Faith people that I can hug I can talk I can laugh I can talk even deep things into the word and they understand my language amen because pretty much everybody outside there it's under contract either I'm getting to the store to buy something or I'm getting into the bank to do something or I'm treating a patient for teeth but this is more than a patient this is people that we will spend eternity with it so when we come to church it's a wonderful thing amen so only believe brother poly will be preaching today and I'm going to translate him go ahead brother P only

thank the Lord Jesus Christ for this opportunity he has given us to be in his house to be in his presence like David desired it amen amen because in his presence Everything Changes the scene change Darkness change into light that's why we are happy I would like to thank the pastor who was inspired to invite me to to bring the word of God to make a little noise for God and we greet you all online those that are streaming godess for the time you taken aside to follow [Music] us truly you not following us but you following the word may God richly bless you before starting let me read something about thirst in paragraph 256 brother says this now I'm asking if your feet are converted you don't dance anymore there out there for the world see let's P our feet to the Lord to the Lord you is your hands converted you don't steal anymore your lips are converted you don't lie anymore just don't get religion in your head get it all over you that say it take the whole man that's right that's right now let's part our feet meaning when the musician are doing their job when they're making noise for the Lord we must accompany them with our Fe when when we are converted everything that belong to us is also converted blessed be the name of the Lord so let's go to uh and pray if you have a request just express it with an uplifted hand to show unto the Lord that you have a need let's pray Heavenly Father creator of Heaven and Earth Heavenly Father we coming unto the as we are as you spoke come onto me you that are and I will give you rest and tonight we come into we have people with uplifted hand maybe there is a maybe to help May a maybe work maybe a promotion you know all things and we asking you to come and Grant that hand that is uplifted unto the it's representing that somebody is going to a dark trial in your life and no one can help but that's the reason why oh God we want you to Grant it father heal the deliver those that are captive and come and and attend to our needs Lord Jesus we take authority upon every spirit and we call them captives and we are submitting them by the authority of the Lord Jesus chist because this place is consecrated and all these people came for you and from this place people are listening they are not here to hear even those that are they want to hear that's why we ask you move us completely out of the way and may you take the control may you speak to your people we thank you for all be blessed and GL and exalted and exalted in Jesus precious name amen amen okay we were going to the book of Psalm let's go to Psalm [Music] 42 verse one all the way to three amen the book of Psalm chapter 42 verse 1 if you dare you can say Amen blessed be the name of the Lord to the chief musician for the sons of Kora verse one as the heart P after the water broke so pth my soul after thee Oh God my soul thirst for God for the Living God When shall I come and appear before God you might be seated amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord based on what we read my little T tonight I took it from the second verse the word thirst and my subject is The Thirst that triggers the miracle of God amen amen where we read here in Psalm 42 [Music] David say this my soul thirst for God but for the Living God he doesn't want a god of History he was looking for a living God because David was facing situation troubles and the situation he was going through require a living God to answer the [Music] call I don't know if it's your case here where or where you are either looking for a god of History are you looking for a living God that created Square with William May or you just hear just to tell stories about what happened in brother bram's [Music] life but if brother Bram gave us the testimony of it's an example to tell you that you also can create squ meaning that when you go into trouble when you have problems you can do the same blessed be the name of the Lord [Music] okay I'm going to read something in the sermon thirst paragraph 25 give me some uh be patient with me I know this is uh Wednesday so we won't be lengthy because I got cach here and there blessed be the name of the Lord what I would like to to read There is [Music] this brother Bram was speaking about the word thirst and brother Bram give the definition of thirst brother Bram said that thirst is a painful desire it's a painful desire when you want something so bad until it becomes painful to you amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord just be patient I'm going to find another one because they are not aligned the way I want it to [Music] be I'm going to paragraph 21 and 22 okay that's where I'm getting into blessed be the name of the Lord amen okay 21 brother say I think David in the writing of this Psalm must have been in distress and he usually take distress to bring the best out of a man it's really that's when God get down to when we fast and many times to get ourself in a position to get out of the way and I think when David got in these places then he begin to meditate on the Lord begin to think about these things paragraph 22 many times God God gets us God gets us in tight Corners where we have to look up where we have to look up sometime we even have to get on our back in a hospital or a bed some where so we can look up to look up to see where the great blessings of God comes from amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord most of the time we find oursel in trouble and when we are faced with trouble we usually have a tendency to think that God have forsaken us or forgotten us or in life maybe one day you got sick or maybe one day you pray God and go Grant you the desire of but when a new situation AR and you will forget what God did for you like did one time you don't remember that God did something for me in the past that he is the same God he can do the same thing over again amen amen in paragraph five brother Bram says this if you are listening here tonight remember this the god that made you go through the first time he can do it again the second time and we are placing our faith in God that he will grant unto you and don't take the devil's lie about anything about anything just remember that God is God and he still remain the same yesterday today and forever David one day faced Goliath and Goliath was terrorizing everybody but David remember something that one day that God delivered me out of a lion and also a bear and the same God can do the same thing or help me to take care of this go to cut the head of Goliath and he used that experience to win Goliath amen amen he never forgot the past experience blessed be the name the I'm going to paragraph 34 blessed be the name of the [Music] Lord now many times I meet people that's prone to be a little nervous when they found out that they're trying to do something and everything is just blocking it off on both sides they say it might not be the will of the Lord now don't let the devil lie to you like that amen amen maybe you have a plan and according to your plan you face obstacles now you begin to question yourself that maybe this is not the will of the Lord because every time I do this it's not working I'm trying to do something is not working all I'm I'm still so I believe it's not the will of God but look at what is the will of God God want to take Israel out of Egypt watch this and to take them all the way to the promised land but all the way they had so many obstacle on the way the were the anak was there and they found Jericho on the way but it's God who promised them the promise and God told them it's the country that have honey and and it's the same thing for you God also give you promises but you will find trials on your ways you must hold tight unto the Lord Jesus Christ and you will come out through because God is more more than able and brother is giving an example of people that get discouraged in paragraph 36 in the message [Music] thirst brother says this like for instance seeking for the baptism of the Holy Ghost many times I run into people saying [Music] I sought for the Holy Ghost I just could not receive it I don't believe it's for me every time I get down I get sick when I go to praying if I fast I get sick if I try to stay on night I stay up I get so sleepy I can't get off my feet remember that is the devil because God intend for you to have the Holy Ghost amen amen PR a promise when God promise you something God will fulfill amen amen another example in paragraph 40 he's talking about somebody who just got converted you might be a brother or a sister and you will see the first day you come to church or maybe you will make it to the Altar and you begin to come to the church very often when you go home that same day you will see maybe your father begin to fight against maybe it's going to be mama who keep getting upset maybe your brothers or sister begin to get upset with you so the very same day you tried to hold on to the word that's when torment start in the home it's all to discourage you but if you hold on tight God is more than able to take you all the way blessed be the name of the Lord and in paragraph 44 brother Bram says he say thirst is a natural thing amen amen it is natural it's not an a natural thing to thirst for God it's a natural thing it's just something that you should do God has made you like that and it's not super human just actually a common human being he Ain just special for some people it is for everyone to thirst after God I'm going keep a lot of things because of time in paragraph 88 for instance brother Bram says this brother Bram says this God want us God want you to thirst for him as the heart P for the water broke my soul first after the oh God I skip a lot of things when David was speaking here when he compare himself to a heart brother Bram explained this in this way brother Bram take the the animal called the heart when the heart is far away from the source of water maybe when he's facing a predator just about to attack him and the water is not too Clos if he's wounded and he start bleeding he can even die right then but if the heart found water somewhere no matter the the bleeding from the wound if the heart can only reach the water [Applause] Brook the heart will be strengthened right then that's why David compare himself and he said that my soul is thirsting amen amen that my soul is thirsting after you oh God because my soul is thirsting after God and not just a God but a living God meaning that when you going through or whatever situation you're going through or maybe somebody's condemning you but if you get closer to the water if you get closer to the presence of God God will wash away your condemnation amen glory be to God that's why David desire the and to reach that situation you must be in a state of urgency in a state that you are hungry when you are really thirsty because remember that the one creating the hunger is God himself the one the problem is God himself and when God initiate the trial he already have a great blessing for you amen glory be to God and God has trust in you God has confidence in you he knows that can so he can change your situation glory to God let me read something [Music] here let me go to paragraph 137 and 138 glory to God blessed be the name of the Lord Brother Bram is saying this here let me tell you friend I don't care how many how many churches you join how many names you put on whichever way you go whe you were Springer or bapti or whatever you are you meet that person Jesus Christ that's the only thing that will really satisfy amen amen 138 he says this emotion won't do it you might jump jump up and down and shout as long as you want to or you might run up and down the flooor and you might speak in tongues as much as you want and Them Things Are Holy and good I don't say I don't say nothing against that I don't have anything against it but until you meet that person that satisfying portion that's something that takes every fiber of your body not by emotion but by a satisfaction brother is saying this it's like we are in church here when we join a certain Church you will see somebody full of emotions amen amen and we also are not against emotion when the Holy Ghost those things must automatically take place but there is a very cunning Spirit of the devil that can infiltrate in the midst of the children of God thinking that when you go through emotion or maybe he feels some Co he says okay therefore the Holy Ghost and you will notice that person when he have that experience he will stop right there and never go further instead of moving forward because the true Holy Ghost will never leave you in one place he won't leave you on emot or just speaking in or doing this or just dance in the spirit but the true holy spirit will bring you to live the entire word of God glory to God and to manifest that same word of God because God is his word blessed be the name of the Lord in paragraph 146 brother BR I'm skipping a lot of things quickly he said my soul thirst after like a heart P after the unless I can find it I perish when you get so hungering for God remember the hungry brother Sten is as long as you're not hungry yet you don't know what can come to you you will not experience the miracle of God and you won't be closer to God it's only when you going through problem when you are really hungering that's the time that you get closer to him that's when you get closer to God and brother that's when you are hungry for God like that then something will take place the holy spirit is to lead you to those great Fountains of God yes sir blessed be the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord I'm going to read something here we just want brother Bram to [Music] speak inph 175 brother brh is speaking about first John 25 if you love the world system all the things of the world [Music] because that the love of God is not even in you amen amen he said now if you want it shows that the love of God is not in you blessed be the name of the Lord 177 he says this by your can tell who is on the throne of your in other words the desire that you have you can identify who is in The Throne of your heart by your desire because what you like it tells you who is in the throne and brother Bram say when I find these things they are good okay well just remember now in your heart you know that what is in your heart yes sir by what is feeding your soul what your soul is thirsting for and you can see it satisfy that if it's if it's not the word then there is something wrong somewhere because the Holy Spirit lives on the word only amen amen blessed be the name of the [Music] Lord amen I'm skipping a lot 14 [Music] 181 so if you neglect to give the Holy Spirit the word of God you shall die amen amen I'm going to 183 brother Bram says if you neglect to read the Bible and to believe the Bible and to and the Holy Spirit to feed upon that you will die Jesus say in St John chter 4 the scripture that I got he said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word not just part of it you need the whole full word amen amen what about you not coming to church and you missing in church three four [Music] times it means that you're getting closer to death I skip a lot of things brother Bram expl brother Bram spoke about the physical thirst and spiritual thirst in a physical thirst brother say when you thirsting after water for instance it means that there is a decoder a detector somewhere and it's uh your detector have noticed that your water level is running low so if you don't take care and find water somewhere you will die amen amen and brother Bram explain the same thing in the spiritual he say he applies to the spiritual as we read it if you don't feed on the word of God if you don't read your Bible how much more are you getting away from life amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord let me read something here blessed be the name of the [Music] Lord let me read something in the sermon communion in 1962 in February the 4th blessed be the name of the [Music] Lord paragraph 71 same quote for Sunday The Cry of hunger listen it's a great cry because it's a distressful cry amen the person is dying and [Music] oh if we could get to that place if this nation could get to that place to where is so hungered for God it is in a worst starvation then the Nations like India that are starving physically this nation is starving spiritually but after you hunger so long if after you hunger so long he gets to the place where you don't know you are hungry amen amen now in paragraph 73 now thirsting Jesus said my blood drink indeed if you're hungering for Life hungering For Life Jesus has the only water that can quench that thirst come unto me all ye that labor and heavy over in Revelation let him that thirst come to the Fant of Water of Life and drink fre if you are thirsting for life amen amen glory be to the name of the Lord and I'm going to the message why Christ speak maybe let me continue before what I was reading okay let's go to why Christ speak paragraph 140 brother Bram is saying this he's speaking about Moses mes got to the place that God told him I am with you your words are my word and I Pro that to you Moses there were no flies in the country it was not the season of flies brother Bram is saying here so we can uh save some time that Moses God made him God meaning the words that Moses was speaking were the words of God and Moses tonight is you my brother you s because the word that Moses have you have and you have not just the word but the word in its fullness but you still making the same mistake that Moses made Moses forgot that he could speak flies into existence he forgot that he could speak thoughts he just speak the word and things will happen but Moses begin to cry unto the Lord that's why God remanded him I place my word in you when you speak it's me speaking and when like tonight if you speak exactly like speaking through so you must give order must command every situation that is troubling you today the struggle we have and the weapon that we have it's a spiritual fight with spiritual [Music] weapons the an that we have today or the am we fac today they are all spiritual it might be maybe aale trouble maybe a cancer maybe a crisis maybe a lack of J and we have to fight for that we have to fight against and we already have the word and we will find that tonight amen glory be to the name of God blessed be the name of the Lord God already gave everything whe it's darkness and then when Moses spoke for Darkness so Moses could even create Darkness but he forgot all of that he begin to cry just the way we do sometime and let me shock you a little bit when you're going through a hard situation when you're crying and when you screaming you don't even speak you just crying like a child w w w but when you look through the scripture somebody like Anna when Anna was crying she was not crying empty with empty words she was crying Talking Lord if you give me a child I will give that child back to you if you do this Lord she was crying speaking she if I do this I will do this to you I will give him back to your service but today Christian they are just crying without saying something you are screaming without speaking you are speaking you are crying without talking you are screaming with words from tonight when you cry say something when you scream speak some word when you you screaming and something will happen to [Music] you I'm going to skip a lot of things we will skip a lot of things do I have a lot of time in paragraph 14 we see here Moses Express truly the human nature that want God to always fall behind and continue to push you to something it is us today you are you are waiting for God despite everything that you experience despite everything that you've seen up to this time you still waiting for God to push you to action Moses relaxed and he said oh God I'm going to ask you uh I want to see what you're saying I'm still in the same paragraph I'm skipping and uh oh yes you said well well I would do the same thing see but here God God already ordained him for the work and God already proved to him that he was with and now that an event is facing him now he start crying what can I do oh Lord look at this situation oh God what can I do oh [Music] God now I want you to listen and to pay attention to the people that knew how to take their position like Joshua Joshua was also anointed to conquer the whole land for God and his people and the days were very short and he needed more time to finish the task the task that he was ordained to finish and he was commissioned to do and Joshua a man he was just anointed and God told him as I was with Moses so shall I be with amen and this country I given unto you I want you to go there and I want you to wipe the country and to remove the am and all other the Philistine and and so forth remove them completely I Am with You J no one shall stand in your face as long as you leave nobody canune you go there and Joshua went and paragraph 167 and the sun obeyed Joshua amen amen Joshua never stayed there and screaming he didn't scream like Moses blessed be the name of the Lord Joshua spoke to the son Joshua never say Lord Jesus Christ I'm trying to stop the sun he just turned around and spoke to the directly to the Sun the word in you he's able to create squ he's able to change situation amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord he never cries Lord what can I do now no oh Lord please give me more he needed light and he spoke you know when you give a command you are giving actually orders Authority you are speaking with authority that's what command say he commanded the Son and the son obeyed him and he spoke to the son to stop if there ever been a time that man should speak it is now my brother my sister this is the time to speak this is the time for you to speak paragraph 18 brother Bram is speaking about pet but Peter never cried when he found a man that had enough Faith to be healed laying at the gate called Beautiful he never got down he never prayed all night all night praying all everyday's prayer or a big long prayer saying Lord I pray you would you help this poor lame man I see that he got faith I know he's a Believer I have asked him and he told me he had faith and he will believe what I told him I have told him about what you did so now I think now Lord can you please give me that the Lord for him [Music] Lord the people that laid in his shadow the sh Peter never prayed for them all scream to them he was just passing by he was the shadow healing the people when he was just passing by he was the shadow that was healing the people the same thing with Jesus Christ when he was with the maniac boy let me read something quickly let's go to the Book of Luke chapter 7 blessed be the name of the Lord Luke 7 verse 11 11 to 15 as verse we don't want to be L it's a resurrection of the boy of so today we must see the resurrection of somebody there are certain things that are dead in your life those things must come back to life and it came to pass the day after that he went into the city called in the city called N N means something that is Pleasant like this December should be a pleasant month for you maybe from the beginning of the year till now you only go please take opportunity for this December that things can change for [Applause] you so that December can be a good month for you so Jesus went to the city called [Music] name and and many of his disciple went with him and now when he came not to the gate of the sea behold there was a dead man carried out so he got to the gate so the funeral home was carrying a dead man so they were going to the cemetery to bury [Music] him I told you that the fight we going through today is spiritual fights amen amen and then they were carrying out a dead man the only son of his mother and she was a widow this is a widow with her only son and she lost that and the boy was already in the coffin the joy of this mother was in the your health in the cofin your work in the coffin your finances in the C people are getting ready to bury your trouble while you screaming you crying for your finances people are carrying them to the ceter but I want your Jesus to you must stop the

the C Jesus is watching your business that is not working in the somebody took that they put it in the coffin but today they must stop and pull that out of the coffin because Jesus saw it and Jesus
