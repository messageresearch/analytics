[45:53] welcome and Joseph was brought down
[45:57] that's sister truin she's right
[46:00] there and Joseph was brought down to
[46:03] Egypt and pipar an officer of pharaoh
[46:07] captain of the Guard an Egyptian bought
[46:11] him of the hands of the ishmaelite which
[46:14] had brought him down there you might be
[46:16] seated now you understand all of this
[46:19] and the Lord was with Joseph yesterday
[46:22] we established the three poles in Egypt
[46:25] amen amen
[46:27] amen amen okay and the Lord was with
[46:31] Joseph and he was a prosperous man and
[46:35] he was in the house of his master the
[46:37] Egyptian and his master saw that the
[46:40] Lord was with him notice that he noticed
[46:43] that God was with Joseph there was
[46:46] something about Joseph that someone can
[46:48] look and say there is a
[46:51] Godly presence something is accompanying
[46:54] this boy this boy is different than any
[46:57] other boy you can tell it by looking at
[47:00] his life that's what we want in our life
[47:02] so wherever you are at work in school
[47:05] people can look at you and they say
[47:07] there is something different about you
[47:09] and the Bible say and his master saw
[47:11] that the Lord was with him and that the
[47:14] Lord made all that he did prosper in his
[47:19] hand and Joseph found Grace in his sight
[47:24] watch those word carefully and he served
[47:27] him and he made him overseer over his
[47:31] house and all that he had he put into
[47:34] his hand and he came to pass from the
[47:38] time that he made him overseer he
[47:40] surrender everything in his house and
[47:43] over all that he had that the Lord
[47:46] blessed the Egyptians house for Joseph's
[47:50] sake the egypti received the blessing
[47:52] because of Joseph so the coming of
[47:54] Joseph into the house brought a blessing
[47:58] so if he was struggling somewhere in the
[48:00] field or in his house with his
[48:02] businesses and maybe things were not
[48:04] going well Joseph coming into the house
[48:07] makes things better amen and the
[48:10] blessing of the Lord was upon all that
[48:12] he had in the house and in the field
[48:17] everybody clear let's go to Luke chapter

[1:21:09] together amen and the food that he store
[1:21:12] up the Bible say it was unlimited
[1:21:14] because it was like the sand that is on
[1:21:17] the seashore which was speaking about
[1:21:19] the Seed of Abraham and yesterday we
[1:21:22] gave you the scripture that the Seed of
[1:21:23] Abraham was

[1:21:41] for those who are looking for it brother

[1:22:05] Jeffersonville was used to store up the
[1:22:08] food am not anybody is food but the food
[1:22:13] of William Marion Bram amen not the food

[1:23:19] of BR Bram is flourishing it is also
[1:23:22] taking care of those that were living
[1:23:24] there but the purpose was to store up
[1:23:27] the food for the oncoming problem amen

[1:31:02] Joseph come to Egypt together until the
[1:31:06] 144,000 will be feeding on the same
[1:31:09] thing through the ministry of Moses and
[1:31:12] Elijah because the seventh seal to the
[1:31:14] blood is the seven trumpet to Israel
[1:31:17] it's in unlimited message in other words
[1:31:19] you can never put a period am to this
[1:31:23] message amen every day God will continue
[1:31:25] to unfold himself through eternity
[1:31:28] because what we reach is the Capstone
[1:31:31] amen the highest level of God and when
[1:31:34] you reach that level it's unlimited amen
[1:31:37] so don't stop at what you hear in church
[1:31:40] here as you going in your H in your car
[1:31:43] God won't speak to you when you
[1:31:46] listening in the kitchen God will speak
[1:31:48] to you when you are wor you playing the
[1:31:51] TS God will speak to you amen when you
[1:31:54] in your bedroom you pring the T God will
[1:31:56] afford to you it is
[1:32:00] [Applause]
[1:32:04] unlimited are we together amen are we
[1:32:07] together amen are we sowing together
[1:32:12] amen amen amen amen so these five
[1:32:17] garments here remove all anxiety from us
[1:32:21] because now we know where we heading
[1:32:23] that's right we know where we coming
[1:32:25] from and we know where we going that's
[1:32:27] why Jesus says this in John
[1:32:30] 16:28 he said I come forth from what the
[1:32:35] father and I come where into the world
[1:32:38] again I leave what the world and I go
[1:32:41] where to the father but let me tell you
[1:32:43] that the way Jesus came is not the way
[1:32:46] he left
[1:32:49] amen say again when he came he came as a
[1:32:54] human being that could be killed that's
[1:32:56] right when he left even the body he left
[1:33:00] was different than the body he came in
[1:33:04] with he came in as a servant of Jehovah
[1:33:09] but he left us a God that have the power
[1:33:12] over Heaven and Earth amen because when
[1:33:15] he resurrected he said oh power has been
[1:33:18] given to me amen and God gave him a new
[1:33:21] name uh-huh and he saw higher than
[1:33:24] anything higher than every principality
[1:33:27] amen every Power he went above all of
[1:33:31] them why because the way you come in is
[1:33:34] going to be different than the way you
[1:33:36] come out amen the way you started here
[1:33:40] will not be the same remember this is a
[1:33:43] one
[1:33:45] way in other word as you changing this
[1:33:48] Mentor you are going from glory to glory
[1:33:52] to glory to glory amen until one day
[1:33:55] your body will change amen and you find
[1:33:59] yourself in the presence of
[1:34:01] God are we together amen are we together
[1:34:05] amen that's why Paul say for I reckon
[1:34:07] that the what the sufferings of of the
[1:34:09] what this present time are not worthy to
[1:34:12] be what compared in other words your
[1:34:14] suffering don't have the gut to be
[1:34:18] compared with the glory that is coming
[1:34:20] in whatever Joseph went through here is
[1:34:24] not to be compared with what's going to
[1:34:26] happen in Egypt am when you look at what
[1:34:29] happened in Egypt and the Joseph in
[1:34:31] Egypt is far greater than what happened
[1:34:33] in Canaan amen your present suffering my
[1:34:37] brother my sister is not compar to what
[1:34:40] is coming up ahead of us Paul say that I
[1:34:43] reckon that the suffering of this
[1:34:45] present time are not worthy to be
[1:34:47] compared with what the glory which shall
[1:34:49] be revealed where in us so there is a
[1:34:52] glory in you that's going to be revealed
[1:34:54] and when that Glory will be revealed you
[1:34:56] won't even have the time to remember the
[1:34:59] suffering you went through the suffering
[1:35:01] will be
[1:35:02] solid that it will be like nothing amen
[1:35:06] that's why he will wipe our tears uh-huh
[1:35:09] and our memories will be completely
[1:35:11] wiped out because what we see make you
[1:35:15] forget it's so overwhelming until you
[1:35:18] don't remember when you were suffering
[1:35:20] in a hospital
[1:35:24] amen amen in other word we know where we
[1:35:27] coming from uh-huh now we know where we
[1:35:29] heading amen we are not here hophazardly
[1:35:32] whichever state in your life you are you
[1:35:35] are not hophazardly you know that
[1:35:37] something is happening you cannot start
[1:35:40] a caterpillar without ending with a
[1:35:42] butterfly that's right if I already
[1:35:43] engage for a caterpillar I must end up
[1:35:46] as a butterfly amen God whenever he's
[1:35:48] after he's Omega amen when he start
[1:35:51] something he will finish it amen and who
[1:35:54] began the good work in you
[1:35:57] uhhuh the Bible say he will complete it
[1:36:00] amen finish it until the day of Jesus
[1:36:03] Christ
[1:36:06] Amen brother Bram says this about this
[1:36:08] guy here he says he remind me of one
[1:36:12] time I don't like to say this word but

[1:36:23] me a
[1:36:25] sandwich I said certainly would you step
[1:36:28] in and instead of making him a sandwich
[1:36:32] I thought I fix him something to eat
[1:36:35] this is Brother BR and fix him up just
[1:36:38] about what I could around the place and
[1:36:41] sit him down to eat and while he was
[1:36:44] eating I thought I would speak to him

[2:11:40] what glorious thing that what that
[2:11:44] Fellowship Samuel is coming everybody's
[2:11:47] trembling have I done something wrong
[2:11:50] what do
[2:11:52] yes God bless you you okay how is this a
[2:11:58] sh what are you
[2:12:01] hiding what are you hiding what is going
[2:12:06] on why are you uncomfortable you should
[2:12:09] be like oh what a surprise oh my God let
[2:12:12] me call hey come the pastor is
[2:12:18] here this message got everything my
[2:12:20] friend
[2:12:24] what if now I got a free pass the door
[2:12:31] open where are we at my
[2:12:33] friend verse five and he said peaceably
[2:12:38] I am come to sacrifice to the Lord
[2:12:41] sanctify yourself and come with me to
[2:12:44] the sacrifice come to the meeting and he
[2:12:47] sanctify Jesse and his son plural Jesse
[2:12:53] and his sons he Sanctified them plural
[2:12:57] Jesse and his sons amen and called them
[2:13:01] to the sacrifice to the
[2:13:03] meeting and it came to pass when they
[2:13:07] were come that he look who's
[2:13:11] looking Prophet the prophet he look on
[2:13:15] elab and said
[2:13:18] surely the Lord anointing is before
[2:13:21] before me before him
[2:13:24] but the instruction was I am the one to
[2:13:27] point to
[2:13:28] you for some reason this boy was so
[2:13:33] impressive that when they look at him
[2:13:35] they say wow this must be him this must
[2:13:38] be him look look how he is this he look
[2:13:40] like a king the suit sit very
[2:13:44] well he will make a good president God
[2:13:46] say
[2:13:49] sh slow slow slow amen but the Lord said
[2:13:54] to Sam look not on his what his
[2:13:58] countenance so the criteria of God is
[2:14:02] not really on the
[2:14:07] Outlook what makes God chose
[2:14:11] David because if he was the Outlook his
[2:14:13] brother would have
[2:14:15] taken he says look not on his
[2:14:18] countenance or on the height of his what
[2:14:24] sture the choice is not on the continent
[2:14:28] young man it is not on the height of the
[2:14:32] statute young man amen the choic is
[2:14:38] but okay good
[2:14:41] luck because I have refused him refused
[2:14:44] him for the Lord sees not as a man what
[2:14:49] see for for man lookth where on the
[2:14:54] outward appearance but the Lord look on
[2:14:56] the what the heart so there was
[2:14:58] something about the heart of
[2:15:01] David that God
[2:15:04] like that's why the purpose of this
[2:15:08] message is to return the
[2:15:11] heart sir sir so when God called you to
[2:15:15] this message God already seen your heart
[2:15:21] that's why God called you even though
[2:15:24] you might be too short or Too Tall that
[2:15:27] was not the choice of God God chose you
[2:15:31] because of your
[2:15:36] heart that's why you have a tag to this
[2:15:38] message and somebody else don't have a
[2:15:41] tag that's exactly amen and the Bible
[2:15:44] says then Jesse call
[2:15:48] abinadab you there let me skip down for
[2:15:51] the sake of time jum to verse 10 Again
[2:15:55] Jesse made what seven of his sons to
[2:15:59] pass before Samuel to pass before Samuel
[2:16:02] and Samuel said to Jesse the Lord has
[2:16:05] not chosen what these how many sons
[2:16:11] seven so did we see David here so David
[2:16:16] is which number eight
[2:16:18] [Music]
[2:16:22] you know the marriage ring right H he
[2:16:25] goes with eternity the two ring of
[2:16:27] marriage put number
[2:16:30] eight because it's two circle of
[2:16:33] Eternity it makes eight are we together
[2:16:37] amen are we together amen David is
[2:16:39] number eight amen amen amen watch
[2:16:43] carefully amen and Samuel said to Jesse
[2:16:49] verse 11 I hear all your children
[2:16:53] because something is wrong how can God
[2:16:55] send me he say one of your child is a is
[2:16:58] a king you finish them
[2:17:00] all and God is saying no Kings that's
[2:17:04] why Samu say wait a minute the Lord
[2:17:06] cannot make a mistake do you have
[2:17:08] somebody that is not here my question is
[2:17:12] where was this
[2:17:14] [Music]
[2:17:17] boy amen amen amen
[2:17:21] amen amen where was this
[2:17:26] boy when the prophet came they came and
[2:17:29] find him a
[2:17:34] home everybody was a home he was not a
[2:17:38] home what was everybody doing a home and
[2:17:43] with him who was not present what was he
[2:17:46] doing where he was
[2:17:51] let me start it again I'm sorry my time
[2:17:54] is running away but I have to go slowly
[2:17:56] so you get this correctly when the
