[45:08] on thee because he trusteth in thee may
[45:11] the lord add a blessing to the reading
[45:13] of his word you may be seated
[45:15] you know we just want to um get right
[45:17] into the word by the grace of god it may
[45:19] be like a sunday school
[45:20] lesson we looked at it but then god's
[45:23] going to have his way
[45:24] we're going to get out of the way and
[45:25] let him have this way amen
[45:27] we're coming there we know that it's
[45:29] wednesday and it's the middle of the
[45:30] week but
[45:31] you know some call it the hump day but i
[45:34] call it the blessing day for those i
[45:36] call it a refilling day
[45:37] for those that serve in the lord is that
[45:39] right so in him
[45:41] you know we're looking at a little
[45:42] thought tonight it's called
[45:44] meditate meditate
[45:48] you know we're going to look at some
[45:49] scriptures because i've been looking to
[45:51] see where the holy spirit's been moving
[45:53] he's been talking about the
[45:55] white dog the black dog and see how the
[45:57] lord is
[45:58] troubling us you know but he also said
[46:00] that
[46:01] do you know these things started we're
[46:03] at in the mind is that right
[46:05] and so we know that we have to lord
[46:08] teaches us to cast down any imagination
[46:10] and try to exhort itself against the
[46:12] word of god
[46:14] so we want to look at a few definitions
[46:16] and live foundation before we get
[46:18] started
[46:19] but we wanted to want you to realize you
[46:21] know that the lord has been bringing us
[46:23] been working in that area even when we
[46:25] were over at the old church you know he
[46:27] started working with the mind he was
[46:29] saying about the mind and the heart and
[46:31] how it works you know you can get away
[46:33] with lies and things
[46:35] while you're still alive and things like
[46:37] that is that right
[46:38] is that buddy also the lord shared with
[46:40] us but now once that mind goes
[46:42] if someone is in the hospital if someone
[46:45] is there and you're praying for them and
[46:46] you ask them that they do something
[46:48] and they're still operating on the
[46:50] intellectual conception is that right
[46:52] they can still tell you yes yes but
[46:55] though they really haven't repented yet
[46:57] and so now when the brain goes now
[46:59] you're dealing with the heart and the
[47:01] soul is that right
[47:02] now they have to answer the truth so we
[47:04] want to just kind of build on those
[47:06] things and what the lord has been
[47:08] showing us because we want to show you
[47:10] how we can stop
[47:12] satan right there we know the prophet of
[47:14] god preached the greatest battle ever
[47:16] fought is that right
[47:17] but we'll show you just by you
[47:20] meditating
[47:21] on the word of god how
[47:24] you will richly bless you how you will
[47:27] move into your position
[47:29] because god has already told us right he
[47:31] stopped that referendum
[47:33] and we stopped the referendum he said
[47:35] that what that we're now
[47:36] is supposed to be moving into our
[47:38] position is that right
[47:40] we have past justification we thank god
[47:42] sanctification
[47:43] baptism of the holy ghost the lord is
[47:45] moving us into our what
[47:47] adoption position is that right the last
[47:50] time
[47:51] we were here we were talking about those
[47:52] things about with them joshua you know
[47:55] when joshua he was a warrior i love
[47:57] joshua and i love david it's just
[47:59] something that just moves my spirit
[48:01] about joshua
[48:02] and david no we was there we we were
[48:05] here and we were sharing with you by the
[48:06] grace of god
[48:07] that we know joshua had a divine
[48:10] commandment
[48:10] from god and he had that divine
[48:13] commandment from from god
[48:15] and that's one of the scriptures we're
[48:17] going to look at but i don't want to get
[48:19] ahead of myself
[48:20] let's look at the definition and things
[48:22] that we wrote down here
[48:24] definition and synonyms of um meditate
[48:29] and our topic is meditate on jesus the
[48:32] resurrection
[48:33] is that right we want to keep our mind
[48:35] on him
[48:36] you know meditate there in the hebrew
[48:39] is a device a device is a form in the
[48:42] mind
[48:43] by by combination thoughts mind by new
[48:46] combinations
[48:47] or applicants is that right you're
[48:49] always going to get thoughts that devils
[48:51] run through your mind
[48:53] you're not out of your mind because you
[48:55] have mind battles
[48:56] everybody have mind battles is that
[48:58] right because god left that to be the
[49:01] battleground
[49:02] it's just a matter of how you handle it
[49:04] that's
[49:05] what it is is that right so we handle it
[49:08] in his age and now
[49:09] the holy spirit also told us where we
[49:12] have been given a word that can
[49:14] defeat the what the black dog and the
[49:16] white dog is that right
[49:18] the flesh in the soul you should be able
[49:20] to live victorious in this hour here now
[49:23] and is that right
[49:24] god is ritually blessing you god is
[49:27] richly bringing us
[49:28] into the position see it's not by power
[49:30] it's not by might
[49:31] but it's by your spirit saith the lord
[49:34] so we will tell you when the holy ghost
[49:36] come
[49:36] the holy ghost is not anything light the
[49:39] holy ghost is a power
[49:40] it's even for you to walk right is that
[49:42] for you to talk right
[49:44] let me for you to love right saying for
[49:46] you to pray right is that it for you to
[49:47] dress right
[49:48] is everything for you to do right is
[49:50] that for you to sing right
[49:51] all these things the holy ghost has come
[49:54] so that we may live a victorious life
[49:56] not a defeated life but a victorious
[49:59] life is that right
[50:00] he sat down look he says and also
[50:04] it's a misuse news
[50:08] news is a stimulation we're going to
[50:10] show you something what happened with uh
[50:12] david
[50:12] at near the end when we get near the end
[50:14] lord it was just i don't have many
[50:16] quotes tonight but it was one quote that
[50:18] kind of pricked my heart
[50:20] that david said and why little bethlehem
[50:23] and and you'll see it it says imagine
[50:27] inspiration that's meditate okay
[50:30] now we're talking about now look at the
[50:33] webster
[50:34] the webster because we're going to have
[50:35] some words that we want to use but it's
[50:38] going to be right in the line
[50:39] with meditators okay he says to focus
[50:42] one's thoughts
[50:44] or to ponder over a plan or project
[50:47] in the mind is that right so god also if
[50:51] you're
[50:51] looking at or studying some of the
[50:53] messages we know that you said time
[50:55] during the day
[50:56] you want your quiet time you need your
[50:59] quiet time is that right
[51:01] to meditate with god so god can give you
[51:04] a direction
[51:05] which way to go because each day we wake
[51:08] up we thank the lord
[51:10] for another day so we ask the lord what
[51:12] is your will for me
[51:14] today lord is that right so we come in
[51:17] here
[51:18] we don't we'll show you we don't have to
[51:19] be afraid of anything
[51:21] is that right god has given us a word
[51:24] the prophet told us way
[51:26] back in prophesizing that there was
[51:28] going to be a plague a pandemic come on
[51:30] the land didn't he
[51:32] he said they were going to look to dr
[51:34] jones to give an
[51:35] answer but this time it was dr fossey is
[51:38] that right
[51:39] he also told him that they was going to
[51:41] use what
[51:42] lysol is that right people you couldn't
[51:44] even keep a light soul on the shelf is
[51:46] that right
[51:47] he told them that some of them say they
[51:49] will stay in the house is that right
[51:51] he also said that some of them said they
[51:53] put on a what
[51:54] a mask is that right
[51:58] tell me the prophet of god wasn't on the
[52:00] money but he said the only thing is
[52:02] going to keep them
[52:04] is the blood of jesus christ the baptism
[52:07] of the holy ghost
[52:09] that's what he said so we know that
[52:11] what's going to keep us
[52:13] so now when you go out and you witness
[52:15] the word of god
[52:16] you want to tell somebody about the
[52:18] blood of jesus christ
[52:20] and tell them about calvary because
[52:22] they're running around with the fear
[52:24] demon on them but the prophet warned us
[52:26] you're way ahead of this time before
[52:28] some of us was even born
[52:30] he warned us is that right meditate
[52:34] on the word of god meditate
[52:38] on thus say the lord he's coming in and
[52:40] let's go to
[52:41] joshua 1 and 8.
[52:47] i won't read it at all we know joshua
[52:48] got the commandment but joshua
[52:50] also we know the type of the holy ghost
[52:53] and joshua also
[52:54] recognized his position when joshua
[52:57] recognized his position
[52:59] that's where the holy spirit is moving
[53:01] you into once you move into your
[53:03] position
[53:04] you see then you have with that
[53:06] confidence
[53:07] god is that right because you're not
[53:09] going to be moved
[53:10] because a commission a commission from
[53:13] god
[53:14] has to be fulfilled it will be fulfilled
[53:17] whether you like it or not if you gotta
[53:19] humble you down if you're gonna share
[53:21] the word
[53:22] or if you're like sometimes you gotta
[53:23] crack the whip on us huh
[53:25] huh but that's love all that i chastise
[53:28] and i rebuke it
[53:29] all those the ones that i love is that
[53:31] right he said be
[53:33] seriously and do what repent is that
[53:35] right
[53:38] he said look what he said joshua 1 and
[53:40] 8. he said this book of the law
[53:42] shall not depart out of thy mouth but
[53:45] thou shall what
[53:46] meditate therein day and night that thou
[53:49] mayest observe to do according to all
[53:52] that is written
[53:54] therein for then thou shalt make
[53:57] thy way prosperous and then
[54:00] thou shalt have what good success
[54:03] so he's telling you all you have to do
[54:06] is meditate on the word of god that
[54:10] you're hearing every day
[54:11] and you apply it is that right
[54:15] so now when god says something now it
[54:18] has to be a result
[54:19] is that right this is the latter rain
[54:21] and this is the former rain time is that
[54:24] right now we cannot have just the
[54:26] mechanics without the dynamics is that
[54:28] right
[54:29] so the word of god is being brought in
[54:31] this hour here to let them know
[54:33] that the resurrected christ is not dead
[54:36] but he's alive is that right
[54:38] i love those testimony we have a
[54:40] testimony tonight when he said someone
[54:42] just god
[54:43] went out someone's prayers just went out
[54:45] and touched somebody's heart
[54:47] and it touched their heart and god
[54:49] touched their heart
[54:50] and he brought that offering unto the
[54:52] lord god bless him whoever he is or she
[54:54] is
[54:55] hallelujah so we're talking about
[54:58] meditating
[54:59] joshua knew that he had that commission
[55:01] when joshua was there joshua not only
[55:04] got the commission from god but once
[55:06] joshua then
[55:07] he went out and he got in his position
[55:10] once
[55:10] got joshua moved into his position then
[55:14] joshua met
[55:14] what the angel is that right the angel
[55:17] over the look of the lord which was the
[55:19] or the lord of hosts which was who
[55:22] christ is that right the
[55:23] anointed and joshua knew his position
[55:26] though
[55:26] right what joshua did he immediately
[55:29] pulled his sword is that right
[55:32] he knew his position if thou be with us
[55:34] or against us
[55:35] and then the angel identified himself
[55:38] joshua immediately fell
[55:40] on his face and did what lord and
[55:42] humbled himself
[55:43] like what does he have me to do we just
[55:45] we're not going to get stuck on joshua
[55:47] tonight
[55:48] though cause i can preach all night
[55:50] there on joshua i just love joshua
[55:52] but we're going to look at some other
[55:53] scriptures we're talking about look at
[55:55] psalms chapter 1
[55:57] and let's see here what the lord by his
[56:01] grace and by his
[56:02] mercy he had there in in this it's a
[56:05] lot in there even the prophet of god
[56:07] kind of hit some things out of that the
[56:09] scripture there and i always loved uh
[56:12] psalms chapter one
[56:13] once you have it say amen he said now
[56:17] he's telling you now remember we share
[56:20] you and meditate
[56:21] if you meditate on the word you will
[56:23] live a victorious life
[56:25] if you mix the word with faith that's
[56:28] right brother mike
[56:29] if you lit the world with faith if you
[56:31] go in there
[56:32] you know if you own your job is that
[56:34] right they're paying you to do that job
[56:37] when brother steve when he leave it he's
[56:39] a dentist is that right
[56:41] he's the dentist he did but he's his own
[56:43] proprietor that's his practice
[56:45] so the times when i go there i drop a
[56:48] little word on him we get a little
[56:49] fellowship but i know
[56:51] he's that there under the anointing of a
[56:52] dentist at that time right
[56:54] so he had to keep his mind on that
[56:56] position there at that time when he's
[56:58] here he's what he's a pastor is that
[57:00] right
[57:00] so he's meditating on his position there
[57:03] is being a pastor
[57:04] when you are on your job you're always a
[57:07] christian you're always a son
[57:08] you're always the daughter of god but
[57:11] you have to rightfully divide
[57:12] when you're in a certain position is
[57:14] that right so you have to understand you
[57:17] know we were in school
[57:18] some children had problems and the
[57:20] problems that they had
[57:21] when they get to middle school you know
[57:23] you change classes now
[57:25] ah what's that adolescent huh
[57:29] huh you changed school i mean you
[57:31] changed classes then is that right
[57:34] we used to have some guys they didn't
[57:35] realize okay you got
[57:37] english you know we tried to get the
[57:39] tough classes in the morning you know
[57:41] you didn't want your tough classes after
[57:43] lunch you drowsy you're lazy you don't
[57:44] feel like doing
[57:45] so you try to get your tough classes
[57:47] schedule in the morning when you're
[57:48] fresh
[57:49] is that right so when we get there when
[57:51] you go
[57:52] in the school maybe you got english
[57:54] first period is that right
[57:56] maybe you got the history second period
[57:58] you have to change your thought pattern
[58:01] you have to change your position for
[58:04] every class you see what i'm saying
[58:06] so then some children have problems
[58:09] changing their position is that right so
[58:12] by them not
[58:12] changing their position they get
[58:14] themselves in trouble maybe they come
[58:16] from
[58:16] gym and all of a sudden you got to go to
[58:19] history
[58:20] but they still got that anointing on
[58:22] them from jim you know
[58:23] and it won't settle themselves down they
[58:25] won't settle their spirit down
[58:27] well we have to understand now god is
[58:30] bringing us
[58:31] into another disposition he's bringing
[58:33] you into the disposition
[58:35] that's what joshua was joshua was moving
[58:38] into the third pole
[58:39] joshua did not have to go back to god
[58:42] and ask god
[58:43] god had already sent joshua on the
[58:45] mission god had already sent you on a
[58:47] commission
[58:48] god had already sent me on the
[58:49] commission so god sent us out here
[58:52] to finish the work and he finished with
[58:54] the work not a defeated life
[58:56] but a victory of life the holy ghost
[58:58] come down on you it's the holy ghost and
[59:01] pow wow
[59:01] the holy ghost has come to fulfill the
[59:04] pain of redemption
[59:05] we're calling you saints we can't get
[59:07] out of it right now
[59:08] we're living a victorious life we're
[59:10] pushing the devil back
[59:12] we do not have to live in any defeated
[59:14] life
[59:15] we don't have to accept anything from
[59:17] the devil is that right
[59:18] they have one scripture one
[59:21] scripture in the wilderness ah
[59:26] one scripture look at all that we have
[59:30] there one scripture the lord thy god
[59:33] that healeth all thy diseases ah
[59:36] all thy diseases when the sickness come
[59:39] upon you
[59:40] it's trespassing we know oh um
[59:43] whatever it is kovic 19 try to come
[59:45] against you
[59:46] his trespassing is that right you don't
[59:49] have to accept anything
[59:50] i mean brother random said the devil
[59:52] come at him and his body he said i'll
[59:54] fight him all the way until i go to
[59:55] sleep
[59:57] huh you don't have to accept anything
[1:00:00] you're trespassing
[1:00:01] you know i wanted to share i wanted to
[1:00:03] preach a message on a testimony maybe
[1:00:05] the lord's willing
[1:00:06] another time but let us stick with this
[1:00:08] this thought here
[1:00:10] meditate humility look what he says here
[1:00:14] hallelujah because i want to get these
[1:00:15] scriptures in i i i tell you
[1:00:18] it says blessed is the man that walked
[1:00:21] not in the counsel of the what
[1:00:23] ungodly nor standing from the way of the
[1:00:26] sinners
[1:00:26] nor sitteth in the seat of the scorn he
[1:00:29] said but
[1:00:30] his the light is in the law of the lord
[1:00:34] and in his law doith he what meditate
[1:00:37] day and night
[1:00:38] he's always looking to thinking about
[1:00:40] things eternal
[1:00:42] he's always looking and thinking to get
[1:00:44] the promise that god made
[1:00:45] that he's going to come get us one day
[1:00:48] we know we have two lives
[1:00:50] you got a natural life you got a
[1:00:51] spiritual life but when you're in there
[1:00:53] fighting when you end up fighting that
[1:00:55] old black dog you got to understand
[1:00:58] all you have to do is meditate on that
[1:01:00] word
[1:01:01] god says when the enemy come in like a
[1:01:04] flood
[1:01:05] he will lift up a mighty standard
[1:01:07] against them
[1:01:08] is that what he said so we bring that
[1:01:10] word in there david had a revelation of
[1:01:12] that
[1:01:13] david had a revelation of god's grace uh
[1:01:16] how did noah get out of it
[1:01:17] let's go let's go and turn back to
[1:01:19] genesis and we'll come back to psalms
[1:01:22] it just dropped in my spirit look at
[1:01:24] genesis 6
[1:01:27] hallelujah look what the lord he was
[1:01:30] telling us there
[1:01:31] uh what the lord was bringing for us
[1:01:35] sunday morning he got in there he says
[1:01:38] now
[1:01:40] we know that let's start at verse one
[1:01:43] and it came to pass when men
[1:01:45] began to multiply in the face of the
[1:01:46] earth the daughters were born
[1:01:48] unto them that the sons of god saw the
[1:01:52] doors of men
[1:01:53] that they were fair and they took them
[1:01:55] wives
[1:01:56] of all which they which they chose now
[1:01:59] what see the lord is trying to share
[1:02:01] with them you got to understand
[1:02:04] noah took a stand you took a stand
[1:02:09] we are taking a stand and our example is
[1:02:12] the way
[1:02:13] jesus christ stands so we have to
[1:02:16] understand in this hour here now that
[1:02:18] christ
[1:02:19] never inhaled anything okay once that
[1:02:23] word went out it did not go out the void
[1:02:26] it went and it was going to produce what
[1:02:27] it was supposed to produce
[1:02:30] god saw us before the foundation of the
[1:02:32] world
[1:02:33] you are sons and daughter of the most
[1:02:35] high god
[1:02:36] you got to understand god chose you to
[1:02:39] fight a battle is that right
[1:02:41] and the battle that he chose chose us to
[1:02:43] fight so you have to be
[1:02:45] careful see what are you getting all
[1:02:48] these words for
[1:02:50] what is god revealing all this word for
[1:02:52] to you
[1:02:53] for you just to sit and become
[1:02:55] complacent or we got to keep our
[1:02:57] commission go ye all the world and
[1:02:59] preach the gospel
[1:03:00] we're go in and tell someone about the
[1:03:02] good news of christ
[1:03:04] going in and let them know that if you
[1:03:06] need prayer
[1:03:07] that we got someone that can pray for
[1:03:10] you
[1:03:10] we have soldiers that can touch heaven
[1:03:13] for you
[1:03:14] we got soldiers that can go to the
[1:03:16] heavenly bank for you
[1:03:17] with confidence is that right god is
[1:03:20] bringing
[1:03:20] god is bringing us into a position where
[1:03:23] you recognize
[1:03:24] that your prayers will be answered is
[1:03:27] that right
[1:03:28] so now we're not just looking to come
[1:03:30] and be a
[1:03:31] a religious spirit we don't want that
[1:03:34] religious spirit on us
[1:03:35] we want to take this word and we want to
[1:03:38] apply it
[1:03:38] you understand no one shouldn't have to
[1:03:41] come in here and tell you to get up and
[1:03:42] praise the lord is that right
[1:03:44] you come in the door dancing prancing
[1:03:47] singing along
[1:03:48] giving god his glory is that right
[1:03:51] because this is what is all
[1:03:52] god in having the praises of his saints
[1:03:54] is that right
[1:03:56] satan hate to see you praising the lord
[1:03:58] he know that we're going through things
[1:04:00] he know that we're struggling but we
[1:04:02] have a god that's going to see us
[1:04:03] through it is that right
[1:04:05] [Applause]
[1:04:07] we speak about faith is that right satan
[1:04:10] is just a tool
[1:04:11] to move us closer to perfection that's
[1:04:14] all he is
[1:04:15] he's a bluff he's a defeated enemy jesus
[1:04:18] christ
[1:04:19] defeated him on calvary is that right
[1:04:22] jesus christ
[1:04:23] came in paid the price for you and i is
[1:04:25] that right
[1:04:26] god could not have sent an angel for you
[1:04:29] for me
[1:04:30] god could not have sent that angel for
[1:04:32] you god had to come down himself
[1:04:35] we needed a kissman redeemer we had to
[1:04:38] come down
[1:04:38] so you are kim folks coming folks to god
[1:04:42] is that right
[1:04:46] glory to god
[1:04:50] look what he said they talked to wife
[1:04:52] someone you wonder why you got trouble
[1:04:54] and really why you got trouble because
[1:04:56] you didn't do it according to god's way
[1:05:01] so if you do it god's way you know where
[1:05:03] you then god is going to work it out
[1:05:05] and if something happened what the lord
[1:05:07] show us is not if you're being tested
[1:05:10] you're being tested by god but if you're
[1:05:12] being tempted you're being tempted of
[1:05:13] your what of your own lust is that right
[1:05:16] so now god's coming in and he's sending
[1:05:19] us a word in this in this
[1:05:21] hour so god showed us sunday there's no
[1:05:24] excuse for you can't have authority over
[1:05:28] your flesh
[1:05:30] no excuse you know you got to come on up
[1:05:33] hither
[1:05:34] you know god has saved the best for last
[1:05:37] hallelujah look what he's saying verse 3
[1:05:40] says and the lord
[1:05:41] said my spirit shall not always what
[1:05:45] strive with man for that he also is
[1:05:48] flesh
[1:05:48] yet his days shall be hundred and twenty
[1:05:52] years
[1:05:52] the lord showed us he shortened those
[1:05:54] days didn't he seem like it was a long
[1:05:56] time but he showed us he's short in
[1:05:58] those days
[1:05:59] and not only did he shorten those days
[1:06:01] god came and showed us
[1:06:03] and that by the garments by prophecy by
[1:06:06] the royal garments
[1:06:07] is not much longer is that right he's
[1:06:10] shown
[1:06:10] us he showed us there that when we came
[1:06:14] with the adoption
[1:06:15] the adoption you know you're always a
[1:06:18] child of god you're always a son
[1:06:20] i mean a child but some never move into
[1:06:22] their position
[1:06:23] to get their full adoption is that right
[1:06:26] because when the holy spirit comes
[1:06:28] minister simple things to you about your
[1:06:31] dress code
[1:06:32] or different things you're still
[1:06:34] struggling with sanctification
[1:06:36] oh say it like it is i still love you
[1:06:40] but now you're coming around in there
[1:06:42] right we're talking about now moving
[1:06:44] into
[1:06:44] the baptism of the holy ghost when the
[1:06:46] holy ghost come there he's dealing with
[1:06:48] you
[1:06:49] but he's not there yet to seal you is
[1:06:52] because
[1:06:53] he got to get you under obedience he
[1:06:56] that obeyed the word of god
[1:06:58] god give them the holy ghost is that
[1:07:00] right and once they get the holy ghost
[1:07:02] now you can move into your position now
[1:07:05] he has
[1:07:05] something inside of you which is his
[1:07:08] spirit
[1:07:09] that he can work with is that right he
[1:07:11] can teach you
[1:07:12] he can train you he can lead you he can
[1:07:15] guide you
[1:07:16] he can use you he can work with you and
[1:07:18] that's all we bring
[1:07:19] you into this is not religion
[1:07:23] this is salvation the joy of the lord
[1:07:27] is my strength when you think about what
[1:07:30] jesus did for you on calvary
[1:07:32] when you get there think about the
[1:07:34] goodness of the blood
[1:07:36] and the thorns that he took every mind
[1:07:38] battle
[1:07:39] that you have he took it to calvary he
[1:07:42] shed his blood
[1:07:43] for you and i
[1:07:46] [Music]
[1:07:48] hallelujah look what he says
[1:07:52] he said now look he said now look at the
[1:07:54] purpose
[1:07:55] of this judgment and god saw verse 5
[1:07:59] and god saw that the wickedness of man
[1:08:02] was great in the earth
[1:08:03] that every imagination in the what
[1:08:06] thoughts
[1:08:07] of his heart was only evil what
[1:08:10] continuously so what you got to remember
[1:08:13] now
[1:08:14] if god says he's not going to always
[1:08:17] strive with man
[1:08:19] that means he's not going to always keep
[1:08:22] pleading with man what he's going to do
[1:08:24] he's going to pos
[1:08:26] he's not going to pardon this
[1:08:28] destruction
[1:08:30] so he's saying this destruction that's
[1:08:33] coming it will not be
[1:08:34] pardoned it's for the wicked because
[1:08:37] they continuously
[1:08:39] go in hard don't think that you don't
[1:08:42] have a testimony
[1:08:44] when they're coming in and brother john
[1:08:47] or brother abel
[1:08:48] i'm gonna come and ask you for a
[1:08:49] testimony you know we had a testimony we
[1:08:52] had a sister and we was down in
[1:08:55] south carolina and if you again shot me
[1:08:58] she went on to be with the lord but she
[1:08:59] had a testimony
[1:09:01] every time we hit the door one day we
[1:09:04] was there we first walked there at home
[1:09:06] uh uh a walmart and they used to give us
[1:09:09] the old liquid detergent
[1:09:10] and get this whole empty bottle and they
[1:09:12] had to just keep the jug
[1:09:14] and we would take the liquid it was
[1:09:16] busting just pour it in the jug
[1:09:18] so they would give it to us and uh one
[1:09:20] day and the lord just put it on my heart
[1:09:22] and i got there and i
[1:09:23] knocked on the door and i said we got
[1:09:25] some liquid detergent
[1:09:26] uh can you use it and you know she got
[1:09:29] it she says
[1:09:30] her and her daughter was living together
[1:09:34] and it was her time to buy the liquid
[1:09:36] detergent that week
[1:09:38] and you know when you're on a fixed
[1:09:40] income you know
[1:09:41] that's a lot for you you know you get
[1:09:44] around it i mean you can get
[1:09:45] extra little bit extra meat maybe bread
[1:09:48] or something or potatoes
[1:09:49] but when she got the church boy i'll
[1:09:52] tell you she told that testimony
[1:09:54] like it was like a thousand dollars
[1:09:56] somebody came and knocked on her door
[1:10:01] always keep a testimony on your heart
[1:10:04] it shows that our christ is not dead but
[1:10:07] he's alive
[1:10:08] he's living in us to tell the devil
[1:10:11] don't like it
[1:10:12] i better stay on my lesson because we'll
[1:10:14] get to that lesson a little later
[1:10:15] hallelujah help me lord
[1:10:17] he said now look so god is not going to
[1:10:20] pardon
[1:10:21] but what he's doing is he he he was
[1:10:24] heavy in his heart that he repented he
[1:10:26] made man
[1:10:27] but what you have to realize young men
[1:10:30] young women
[1:10:31] you know we some of us out there we got
[1:10:34] the hormone and drugging
[1:10:36] and drinking and smoking and doing
[1:10:38] things you know we thank god for deliver
[1:10:40] us
[1:10:41] we thank god for saving our soul we
[1:10:43] thank god for those things
[1:10:45] but you know what y'all got a greater
[1:10:47] testimony
[1:10:48] you know why because you got a god
[1:10:50] that's keeping you from all that
[1:10:52] you could kind of god from keeping you
[1:10:54] from those things you got a god that's
[1:10:56] watching over you greater is he
[1:10:58] that is indeed than he that is in the
[1:11:01] world you got a testimony huh
[1:11:03] hallelujah

[1:11:08] look what he says he said hallelujah
[1:11:11] work continuously
[1:11:13] we have another one look look at let's
[1:11:15] go back to psalms 1.
[1:11:18] hallelujah see what the lord
[1:11:21] help us on this one here just a point by
[1:11:24] the grace of god kind of struck my
[1:11:26] spirit
[1:11:28] is psalms 1
[1:11:32] hallelujah it says then
[1:11:35] but verse 2 but his delight
[1:11:39] is in the law of the lord and his and in
[1:11:42] his law
[1:11:43] doeth he meditate day and night he says
[1:11:46] and he shall be like a tree planted
[1:11:49] by the rivers of water that bringeth
[1:11:52] forth
[1:11:53] who his fruit and what his
[1:11:56] season is that right he's in the sun
[1:11:59] in season his leaf also
[1:12:03] shall not what wither and whatsoever he
[1:12:06] does
[1:12:06] shall up prosperous is that right

[1:12:13] he typed it with the nine spiritual
[1:12:15] gifts he came in there and he's talked
[1:12:17] about it
[1:12:18] those gifts are sitting up in here you
[1:12:20] are not to be ashamed of those gifts
[1:12:22] if god put those gifts in you god put
[1:12:25] those gifts in you
[1:12:26] to bless his people they come in there
[1:12:29] and those singers he brought you in to
[1:12:31] drive those demon forces away
[1:12:34] and he anointed you he positioned you

[1:12:43] before the foundation of the world
[1:12:45] speaking in tongues prophesizing
[1:12:48] interpretation he said those not
[1:12:51] spiritual gifts is in the body of jesus
[1:12:53] christ
[1:12:54] all of them is here says just humble
[1:12:56] yourself

[1:13:27] go
[1:13:28] for the sake of time let us go from 26
[1:13:31] we'll start at verse
[1:13:33] 26 psalms 37 and verse 26
[1:13:37] although the habits say amen
[1:13:40] okay here a few pages let us look at it
[1:13:44] meditate and you meditate with the lord
[1:13:47] keep in your mind on the word of the
[1:13:50] lord
[1:13:51] you'll live a victorious life
[1:13:54] he said now look i said thirty we'll
[1:13:57] start at verse
[1:13:58] 26. it says he is ever merciful
[1:14:02] and and lindeth and his seed is what
[1:14:05] blessed he says hallelujah depart
[1:14:09] from evil and do good and dwell
[1:14:12] forevermore
[1:14:13] for the lord love his judgment and
[1:14:15] forsake not his saints
[1:14:17] you'll never be forsaken you've never
[1:14:19] seen the righteous forsaken or seed
[1:14:20] beggar from bed
[1:14:22] they are preserved what forever
[1:14:25] is that right god has preserved you not
[1:14:27] only to eternal life
[1:14:29] he preserved you to finish this work why
[1:14:32] we're here on this earth
[1:14:33] and you know you have eternal life
[1:14:36] because it's already been paid for is
[1:14:38] that right
[1:14:39] we recognize with the blood of jesus
[1:14:41] christ has did
[1:14:42] for each and every one of us saints he
[1:14:44] says hallelujah
[1:14:47] he says verse but verse 28
[1:14:51] for the lord love his judgment and
[1:14:53] forsake not his saints
[1:14:55] they are preserved forever but the seed
[1:14:58] of the wicked shall be cut off
[1:15:00] the righteous shall inherit the land and
[1:15:02] dwell there forever
[1:15:04] he says and the you and the mouth of the
[1:15:06] righteous speaketh what
[1:15:09] wisdom you see you trusted in the word
[1:15:11] of the lord trust in the lord in all thy
[1:15:13] ways
[1:15:14] lean not to thy own understanding he
[1:15:16] will lead he will god
[1:15:18] he will direct your path some of you are
[1:15:20] taking
[1:15:21] college classes college courses some of
[1:15:23] you there
[1:15:24] but god never knocked education but when
[1:15:27] you to when your back gets up against
[1:15:29] the wall
[1:15:30] and all that you have learned is all
[1:15:32] your education can produce
[1:15:34] you remember the word of the lord is
[1:15:36] that right
[1:15:37] you turn to the lord and the lord would
[1:15:39] come in because your motive
[1:15:41] and your objective is to glorify the
[1:15:44] lord
[1:15:44] heard brother randall say one time when
[1:15:46] you go out and preach the gospel
[1:15:48] you gotta ask god first to give you a
[1:15:50] word to go into that heart
[1:15:52] is that right you got to get a word to
[1:15:54] go into that heart
[1:15:55] you got to get the gospel anointed
[1:15:58] vessel
[1:15:58] anointing you got to be called by god
[1:16:00] you got to be anointed by god
[1:16:02] by the word of god for the timing of god
[1:16:05] in the position of god
[1:16:07] it's all by god jesus said when i come i
[1:16:09] do nothing unless the father what
[1:16:11] show me is that right when he went there
[1:16:13] to the grave
[1:16:14] he went to the grave and he told lazarus
[1:16:17] god told him to go to the grave when he
[1:16:19] went to that grave
[1:16:20] he knew he was going to raise lazarus he
[1:16:22] would have called the whole world
[1:16:24] and then that is that right but remember
[1:16:26] the man that had the palsy
[1:16:28] and he was on the bed is that right or

[1:25:26] the baptists
[1:25:27] the methodists the lutherans the scribes
[1:25:30] the herodians they speak like someone
[1:25:33] with authority that has been with jesus

[1:25:42] look what he says hallelujah he says
[1:25:45] over here

[1:26:37] hallelujah he says and now he said but
[1:26:40] by stretching forth thy hand
[1:26:42] and look at verse 31 here's where we're
[1:26:44] getting to and
[1:26:45] when they had prayed the place was what
[1:26:49] shaken
[1:26:50] where they was assembly together and
[1:26:53] they
[1:26:53] were all filled with the what holy ghost
[1:26:57] and spake the word of god with what
[1:27:00] so you want to pray within the holy
[1:27:03] ghost is that right and it will
[1:27:05] increase your faith if you want to get
[1:27:08] that boldness
[1:27:09] if you want to recognize that presence
[1:27:11] you increase your prayer
[1:27:12] life you stand in the gap when god is be
[1:27:16] obedient when god
[1:27:17] wants you to get up and pray you prayer
[1:27:19] warriors
[1:27:20] that's what god ever called you for god
[1:27:23] have called you when he want to wake you
[1:27:24] up to stand in the gap with someone
[1:27:26] when that name come to you in prayer
[1:27:29] when that name or someone that you know
[1:27:31] that that that or you work with or a
[1:27:33] co-worker when they come to you in
[1:27:35] prayer
[1:27:36] is that right you speak that name with
[1:27:38] boldness and with authority
[1:27:40] and you claim their salvation god has
[1:27:43] chosen you is that right
[1:27:44] god not has only also given us the holy
[1:27:47] ghost but he's given us the holy ghost
[1:27:49] because we can grant someone brother
[1:27:51] steve
[1:27:51] eternal life is that right what is
[1:27:54] greater than granting someone
[1:27:55] eternal life saints
[1:27:59] god has given you the authority saints
[1:28:02] don't
[1:28:02] don't live below your standards
[1:28:05] huh the only other way black dog
[1:28:09] you look at that black dog if you got
[1:28:11] problem with that television with the
[1:28:12] movies
[1:28:13] then you ask god to take them the
[1:28:15] television from you
[1:28:16] take that desire from your heart is that
[1:28:18] right you ask god to fill your heart
[1:28:20] with something else
[1:28:21] it's just like the holy ghost was saying
[1:28:23] don't be ashamed because you're
[1:28:25] struggling with something and you've
[1:28:26] been around the message for 10
[1:28:28] 15 years oh well you've been dealing
[1:28:30] with a religious spirit that's
[1:28:32] all we're not going we're not connected
[1:28:35] like they are up there in uh
[1:28:37] jeffersonville they don't want no
[1:28:39] fivefold ministry
[1:28:40] they don't want no five-fold ministry
[1:28:42] you know that's nothing new if you go
[1:28:43] for
[1:28:44] god's um the prophet that god preached
[1:28:46] the message i was not disobedient to the
[1:28:48] heavenly vision
[1:28:49] that was given to me he told him it was
[1:28:51] going god told him it was going to be
[1:28:52] like that in jeffersonville go pick up
[1:28:54] the message
[1:28:55] it's in that message it's in there you
[1:28:57] got to understand that god
[1:28:59] has prepared us he said when he gets he
[1:29:02] said we are the seed of abraham
[1:29:04] not just any seed of abraham you're the
[1:29:06] royal seed of abraham
[1:29:07] all of this is not for everyone why do
[1:29:10] you think that the pastor
[1:29:11] got around there and the lord told him
[1:29:14] on that message
[1:29:15] not to record it not to let it out is
[1:29:17] that right
[1:29:18] because the prophecy message is that
[1:29:20] right god knows what he's doing
[1:29:22] doing the adoption is that right when
[1:29:24] that what he was ministering
[1:29:25] he was ministering during the adoption
[1:29:27] when he come around there when they went
[1:29:29] to
[1:29:29] matthew 17 and they went to mountain
[1:29:31] mount transfiguration is that right
[1:29:33] he took peter james and john he took
[1:29:36] faith hope and charity when he took them
[1:29:38] up there
[1:29:39] he showed them now it was a type of the
[1:29:41] adoption
[1:29:42] he was identifying that jesus christ was
[1:29:44] the one
[1:29:45] but when he came down and he said what
[1:29:47] tell no one what you saw
[1:29:50] catch it don't record that don't let
[1:29:53] them know what i gave you
[1:29:59] come on sanctuary you got the royal
[1:30:02] garments on
[1:30:05] you got the royal garments on
[1:30:08] god is opening his word here
[1:30:12] this is not religion when you got
[1:30:15] salvation you live a victorious life
[1:30:17] the holy ghost is positive the holy
[1:30:21] ghost comes
[1:30:21] in and move us into that position
[1:30:24] hallelujah
[1:30:26] he says now look and they and they speak
[1:30:28] the word with boldness

[1:36:05] hallelujah because i want to get i want
[1:36:07] to close out with that david i'ma jump a
[1:36:09] little bit now
[1:36:10] he says now he said now look in verse 15
[1:36:14] he says i will what
[1:36:17] meditate in thy precepts his
[1:36:19] commandments
[1:36:20] that's what joshua did see joshua
[1:36:22] remember the commandments of
[1:36:24] god he meditate on those things is that
[1:36:26] right
[1:36:27] so joshua always prosper when joshua got
[1:36:30] in that land
[1:36:31] he know he had to fight is that right he
[1:36:33] still had to fight
[1:36:34] and the only time when they got in there
[1:36:37] the gideons got
[1:36:38] in there when when joshua went to the
[1:36:40] princesses
[1:36:41] and joshua didn't go to god is that
[1:36:44] right so he temporarily did they
[1:36:46] temporarily deceived them but
[1:36:48] joshua said okay i gotta keep my word
[1:36:50] but i'm gonna give you the hard job
[1:36:52] i mean you're gonna hurt the water
[1:36:54] you're gonna hold the wood
[1:36:56] but i'm gonna make you work since you
[1:36:57] got in here hallelujah
[1:36:59] when joshua got in that promised land
[1:37:02] that's what he was telling them
[1:37:03] he was telling them some of them still
[1:37:05] hadn't possessed their land yet
[1:37:07] but when they got in there they still
[1:37:08] had to fight these wars
[1:37:10] some of you still fighting mind battles
[1:37:12] some in the fight i heard the holy
[1:37:13] spirit say
[1:37:14] sunday pornography i say the holy spirit
[1:37:16] is saying watching the wrong movies i
[1:37:18] see the holy spirit saying you're being
[1:37:20] entertained with the wrong company come
[1:37:23] on saints
[1:37:24] keep thy mind steadfast young men young
[1:37:26] women

[1:37:29] to fall keep your mind on the promises
[1:37:31] of god is that right
[1:37:33] he's able to keep you hallelujah he said
[1:37:36] meditate
[1:37:37] in verse 6 verse 16 he said i will
[1:37:40] delight myself
[1:37:41] in thy statute i will not forget thy
[1:37:43] word this term in the same book psalms
[1:37:46] 112.
[1:37:47] hallelujah meditating on the word of god
[1:37:51] psalms 12 and in verse 8
[1:37:56] hallelujah he says his heart is
[1:37:58] established
[1:37:59] he shall not be afraid until he see his
[1:38:03] desire
[1:38:04] upon his enemies so there's i think that
[1:38:07] was
[1:38:09] that hallelujah
[1:38:13] i think it was another scripture god
[1:38:16] joshua
[1:38:19] that was it hallelujah
[1:38:23] just bear with me there saints
[1:38:28] let's look here
[1:38:31] and i want to read it's one quote that
[1:38:35] was pressing on me
[1:38:38] and i tell you it really just kind of
[1:38:41] dropped i didn't know why
[1:38:43] but i was looking at the
[1:38:46] different quotes i tried to get the ins
[1:38:48] inspiration
[1:38:50] quotes that god spoke through the
[1:38:52] prophet that would be a blessing to you
[1:38:56] but this one here it was in uh
[1:39:00] why little bethlehem
[1:39:03] it was 12 14 63
[1:39:07] and it was a time when david was
[1:39:10] basically there
[1:39:12] on the run and the prophet of god was
[1:39:15] he came out of he was kind of tired with
[1:39:18] the message thirst
[1:39:20] when he was there and he was saying with
[1:39:22] david
[1:39:24] what he was doing was probably
[1:39:26] meditating
[1:39:28] on the word of god thinking about the
[1:39:30] goodness of the lord
[1:39:32] see the goodness of the lord is what
[1:39:34] leads a man to repentance
[1:39:37] so we tell them about the good news
[1:39:40] jesus christ
[1:39:41] we tell him when we go out there what
[1:39:43] he's done for us
[1:39:44] how he can save his soul how he can
[1:39:47] deliver a person from anything
[1:39:48] we're not just the seed we're the royal
[1:39:51] seed of
[1:39:51] abraham and by us being the royal seed
[1:39:55] of abraham
[1:39:56] you know he says that that seed can
[1:39:59] believe
[1:40:00] and take god for at his word that's what
[1:40:03] the holy spirit is mean
[1:40:04] we we still have an altar call i always
[1:40:08] will have an altar card you call you
[1:40:11] have to discern where the people
[1:40:13] are and once you discern where the
[1:40:15] people are but what god is getting us to
[1:40:17] do is just to receive the spoken word
[1:40:20] and receive the word for for your hour
[1:40:22] as peter spoke these words
[1:40:24] did the holy ghost fall on them is that
[1:40:27] right so we have to
[1:40:28] understand now that's what he's moving
[1:40:30] us into but that's why he held the
[1:40:32] pastor up
[1:40:33] is that right he had to hold him up
[1:40:35] because uh
[1:40:39] the lord is long suffering and the lord
[1:40:42] is merciful
[1:40:44] but we're getting close to that time but
[1:40:47] i wanted to
[1:40:48] definitely want you to see this here god
[1:40:51] help me
[1:40:53] i didn't get to i didn't get to all of
[1:40:54] it but that's okay the lord is having
[1:40:56] this way
[1:40:57] and here i'm going to jump a little bit
[1:41:00] so you have to just
[1:41:01] stick with me he was talking about here
[1:41:04] with
[1:41:04] he said david was probably there
[1:41:06] meditating um there
[1:41:08] on the word of god but then he says
[1:41:11] he must have come over a different
[1:41:13] psalms
[1:41:14] he said the lord is my shepherd i shall
[1:41:17] not warn he maketh me to lie down in the
[1:41:19] green pastures he leadeth me
[1:41:21] beside still waters he restore my soul
[1:41:23] oh he leadeth be in the path of
[1:41:24] righteousness
[1:41:25] for his name's sake and though i walk
[1:41:27] through the valley in the shadow of
[1:41:28] death
[1:41:29] and i fear no evil for thou art with me
[1:41:31] as thou
[1:41:32] as thou as he thought as he thought
[1:41:36] on these things he meditated meditating
[1:41:39] it must have been a he said must have
[1:41:41] been a hot day
[1:41:43] he said he got thirsty and got sweaty
[1:41:47] he could look way down into the valley
[1:41:50] from the top of the mountains
[1:41:52] on the east side of the west side on the
[1:41:54] east side
[1:41:55] of the city when he looked down and he
[1:41:58] seen where the philistines all
[1:42:01] down there thousands of them garrisons
[1:42:04] around
[1:42:05] he's seen he he's seen that old well
[1:42:09] where he once drank hallelujah
[1:42:13] he says now he is our bread
[1:42:16] god's bread and water for us he's the
[1:42:20] sinner
[1:42:21] and the only place that you can come and
[1:42:24] get it
[1:42:25] it's from it's from him god's house
[1:42:29] in in the person of jesus christ
[1:42:32] now david here let's turn to uh
[1:42:36] and we're about to wind it up let's turn
[1:42:38] to
[1:42:39] um ii samuel
[1:42:42] 22.
[1:42:45] and here i think the prophet of god was
[1:42:48] seeing something
[1:42:50] and when he got over there and in this
[1:42:52] book here
[1:42:53] god help me
[1:42:57] in there
[1:43:01] i say second samuel then i'm in first
[1:43:03] down you okay
[1:43:08] hallelujah
[1:43:10] now over there in second samuel i mean
[1:43:13] first samuel i'm sorry first samuel 22
[1:43:15] and 1.
[1:43:16] i'll i'll read it if you're writing it
[1:43:18] down um you can go back and look at it
[1:43:20] for the sake of time
[1:43:22] he says david therefore departed hence
[1:43:24] and escaped
[1:43:25] to to the cave at a lamb
[1:43:28] and when his brethren and all his
[1:43:31] father's house heard it
[1:43:32] they went down here to him now this is
[1:43:35] not the first time
[1:43:36] david remember david went into this cave
[1:43:39] david went to this place this was down
[1:43:42] there
[1:43:42] and brother stephen something because
[1:43:44] it's down there near after them
[1:43:46] and it went down and they want you to
[1:43:47] see these scriptures and when the things
[1:43:49] dropped in there i see why the way the
[1:43:51] lord and why the holy ghost got him
[1:43:53] going
[1:43:53] and when he got him going down there he
[1:43:55] said now look ii samuel
[1:43:57] 23 and we know david was on the run in
[1:44:00] first samuel is that right i think saul
[1:44:01] was at him and was trying to kill him
[1:44:04] well david went to that cave david was
[1:44:06] in that hole with david knew in that
[1:44:08] hole there
[1:44:08] that god had met him there he just
[1:44:11] didn't go in there for no reason at
[1:44:13] all brother branham said he got around
[1:44:14] and then he said he looked
[1:44:16] and he said even look he thought about
[1:44:18] that water he thought about that
[1:44:20] thirsting
[1:44:20] he talked about he thought about outside
[1:44:22] of that gate of that whale that he would
[1:44:24] get that fresh water from is that right
[1:44:27] now we're going to now we go to ii
[1:44:28] samuel let's go to chapter 23.
[1:44:32] ii samuel 23 and we'll look over there
[1:44:35] and we'll
[1:44:36] start at verse 10 for the sake of time
[1:44:39] he rose and smoked the philistines until
[1:44:41] his hand was weary
[1:44:42] and his hand came uh i'm sorry verse
[1:44:45] eight verse eight
[1:44:46] he said these be the names of the mighty
[1:44:49] men
[1:44:50] whom david had
[1:44:53] the tacomite that sat in the seat chief
[1:44:56] among the captains the same was adeno
[1:45:00] and he's night he lifted up his
[1:45:04] spirit against the 800 whom he slew at
[1:45:07] one time
[1:45:08] he said now now remember these men names
[1:45:11] they meant
[1:45:12] something it just wasn't they they just
[1:45:15] wasn't just a
[1:45:16] a name on them i think uh let me see
[1:45:18] hallelujah
[1:45:19] what i'm talking about it was wisdom
[1:45:22] it was the wisdom david if these men
[1:45:25] were sent
[1:45:25] by god then it has to be something
[1:45:28] inside of them to protect god's servant
[1:45:32] still with me his name meant wisdom it
[1:45:35] says the
[1:45:35] 809 meant ornament he was a slender mean
[1:45:39] as a spirit he was as a spirit and
[1:45:42] eliezer he was god has
[1:45:46] helped god has sent his help now you
[1:45:48] just bear with me and be prayerful with
[1:45:50] me
[1:45:51] he says now look he
[1:45:54] hallelujah he says in verse
[1:45:58] nine he says and after him
[1:46:01] was eliezer the son of the dodo he said
[1:46:04] the
[1:46:05] a hoaxite and one of the and
[1:46:08] and one thing said dudu
[1:46:11] three mighty men with david when they
[1:46:14] defiled the philistines were
[1:46:16] gathered together to battle and the men
[1:46:18] of israel were going away
[1:46:20] he rose and smoked the philistines until
[1:46:23] his hand was weary
[1:46:25] and enclaved and the lord wrote a great
[1:46:28] victory that day
[1:46:29] and the people returned after him only
[1:46:32] to spoil
[1:46:32] he says and after him was shammite the
[1:46:36] son of aggie
[1:46:37] the heroite he said in the philistines
[1:46:39] were gathered together
[1:46:41] into a a troop where was the piece of
[1:46:44] ground
[1:46:45] full of lentils and the and the people
[1:46:48] fled from the philistines but he stood
[1:46:51] in the midst of the ground and defended
[1:46:53] it and slew the philistines
[1:46:55] and the lord walked a great victory he
[1:46:58] says and three of the 30 chiefs went
[1:47:00] down and came to david in the harvest
[1:47:02] time
[1:47:03] unto the cave of adelum he said now look
[1:47:06] i think i wrote it down here if god help
[1:47:08] me
[1:47:09] hallelujah see what he says to adelum
[1:47:14] he says hallelujah it was it was a
[1:47:16] hiding place
[1:47:18] it was too high it was a justice who was
[1:47:22] according to
[1:47:23] justice of other people but it was a
[1:47:25] hiding place
[1:47:26] this place was a cave that david went to
[1:47:30] he said and the troop of the philistines
[1:47:33] pitched
[1:47:33] in the valley of reference he said now
[1:47:36] look if you look at first chronicles 11
[1:47:38] we won't turn it there but you can look
[1:47:40] at it
[1:47:40] in first chronicles 11 now three of the
[1:47:43] city captains went down to the rock to
[1:47:45] david
[1:47:46] and to the cave of adelaide and the host
[1:47:49] of the philistines encamped the valley
[1:47:52] of referendum
[1:47:53] hallelujah he says and david was then
[1:47:56] then and hold in the garrisons of the
[1:47:58] philistine i'ma drop down a little bit
[1:48:00] he said david long
[1:48:02] and said oh that one would give me a
[1:48:05] drink of water of the well of bethlehem
[1:48:07] which is by the gate now remember david
[1:48:10] was seeing more
[1:48:11] it was hot it was during that time
[1:48:13] probably around april
[1:48:15] it was harvest time and david knew it
[1:48:17] was round in harvest time
[1:48:19] in david's demonstration what he did
[1:48:21] with that water going to prove
[1:48:23] that david was looking at more he was
[1:48:25] seeing that more
[1:48:26] when david went in that cave when david
[1:48:28] met their god
[1:48:30] he knew god would meet him there that
[1:48:32] was a prayer place for david
[1:48:34] maybe perhaps they said that the rocks
[1:48:36] back then was like a made of a limestone
[1:48:38] you're still with me now you got to put
[1:48:40] on your spiritual cap saints
[1:48:42] i'm telling you you got to have that
[1:48:44] place you got that prayer place
[1:48:46] where god can meet you and you know god
[1:48:48] will meet your needs is that right
[1:48:50] but david had the desire david was
[1:48:53] meditating on the lord
[1:48:55] that david was thinking about the
[1:48:56] goodness of the lord
[1:48:58] david was thinking about the water that
[1:49:00] he wasn't wanting to drink
[1:49:02] but baby was thinking more than just a
[1:49:04] drink of water
[1:49:05] look at me saying help me saints pray
[1:49:07] with me now we closing it out
[1:49:09] hallelujah verse 17 and he said
[1:49:13] being far from me o lord that i should
[1:49:16] do this
[1:49:17] is not this the blood of the men that
[1:49:19] went into jeopardy
[1:49:21] well he says now look he said therefore
[1:49:24] he would not drink it these things did
[1:49:27] his
[1:49:28] three mighty men in absence and the
[1:49:31] brother of joab
[1:49:32] the son of jeremiah was chief among thee
[1:49:36] and he lifted up his spirit against the
[1:49:38] hundred and slewed them
[1:49:39] and had the name among them but when we
[1:49:42] look in that saints
[1:49:43] when david came there you go back and
[1:49:45] you look at it
[1:49:46] david came david remember that he
[1:49:49] remember
[1:49:50] he saw the anointing he saw the
[1:49:52] supernatural of god
[1:49:54] he saw these men that was willing to
[1:49:56] sacrifice
[1:49:57] david knew that it was down to time what
[1:50:00] it was pentecostal time
[1:50:01] it was jubilee time it was time brother
[1:50:04] steve
[1:50:04] i believe david wanted to make a
[1:50:06] sacrifice i think the heart was crying
[1:50:09] out
[1:50:09] he wanted to be there in that worship he
[1:50:11] remembered what god had brought him out
[1:50:13] of
[1:50:13] he remembered what god had brought him
[1:50:15] through so david what he did
[1:50:17] he didn't even drink that water i
[1:50:19] believe david was crying for the
[1:50:21] presence of the lord i mean david was
[1:50:23] looking for this presence
[1:50:24] that's here tonight david wanted to be
[1:50:26] able to rejoice
[1:50:27] over the word of god david wanted to be
[1:50:30] rejoiced because he thought about
[1:50:32] he remembered how god had brought his
[1:50:34] people out of
[1:50:35] egypt from the bondage being burdened
[1:50:38] down
[1:50:38] so david remember when he got in that
[1:50:40] cave david saw it
[1:50:42] and god met him and baby requested it
[1:50:44] was one more prophetic
[1:50:46] request that was made by david and god
[1:50:50] granted it and he saw the mercy
[1:50:52] that was extended to him with those men
[1:50:55] fighting through all of that
[1:50:57] to just get that drink of water we
[1:50:59] sacrificed
[1:51:00] the men of god they sacrificed they
[1:51:03] sacrificed the word of god
[1:51:05] i'm just touching on it the lord i have
[1:51:07] the holy spirit of finish taking that
[1:51:10] ref from them
[1:51:10] that's why he stopped this david went
[1:51:12] down there david went down there
[1:51:14] a couple times i think it was three
[1:51:16] times to meet god and when he went down
[1:51:18] there to meet god
[1:51:20] and god always met him there david knew
[1:51:22] he could meet god there
[1:51:24] david knew he can get his faith built up
[1:51:26] there praying most much in the holy
[1:51:28] ghost but we'll do what will increase

[1:57:50] visitor family member always
[1:57:52] feel welcome to come in this place and
[1:57:55] worship together with us amen
[1:57:58] meditation meditation
[1:58:01] meditation we already explained to you
[1:58:04] that meditation
[1:58:05] is one of the key to the third pull
[1:58:09] you remember her brother branham was
[1:58:11] sitting by the
[1:58:13] tree and keep on meditating meditating
[1:58:18] actually we need to find some quiet time
[1:58:20] in the
[1:58:22] in our day we got so busy
[1:58:26] you trying to sit quiet and we got that
[1:58:29] ring on the telephone every time
[1:58:31] somebody
[1:58:32] shoots something it goes and it's
[1:58:35] telling you
[1:58:36] check it again either it's whatsapp or
[1:58:39] facebook
[1:58:40] or the crazy tick talk
[1:58:43] or whatever that is going on keep
[1:58:46] blowing your telephone
[1:58:47] all the time because the devil knows the
[1:58:50] black dog knows
[1:58:52] that if you get your mind quiet enough
[1:58:55] the lord will speak to you amen we are
[1:58:58] so busy
[1:58:59] wrapped up thinking about everything you
[1:59:02] got to do this you got to do this you
[1:59:04] got to do this by the end of the day
[1:59:06] you are completely worn out and you just
[1:59:09] go to sleep
[1:59:10] no time for the lord sometimes you need
[1:59:13] to take that telephone
[1:59:14] and push it aside just sit quiet
[1:59:17] and think about the lord think about the
[1:59:20] scripture
[1:59:22] the bible says in genesis 6 that brother
[1:59:24] kelly read that the sons of god
[1:59:27] looked at the daughters of men how can
[1:59:30] you just look at a woman and go and
[1:59:32] tomorrow you get in trouble
[1:59:34] if you look between the line they were
[1:59:36] pondering on it
[1:59:38] because james explained to us that we
[1:59:41] were we are drawn away
[1:59:43] by our own lust and then when you
[1:59:46] continue to ponder
[1:59:47] over and over you get a thought and you
[1:59:50] keep thinking over
[1:59:51] over and over you are actually pushing
[1:59:54] that
[1:59:55] thought into the subconscious into the
[1:59:58] soul you are insisting
[2:00:00] and your soul just get a message that
[2:00:02] this is what he wants me to do
[2:00:04] and he suck it down once it's down
[2:00:08] it will take the grace of god to get you
[2:00:10] off of it
[2:00:11] if there is not enough strong prayer
[2:00:14] automatically
[2:00:15] sin is conceived when sin is conceived
[2:00:19] you're gonna go after it you actually
[2:00:21] manifesting what is already done
[2:00:24] in your heart so when somebody committed
[2:00:26] adultery
[2:00:27] it's not that the sin and the committed
[2:00:29] adultery no adultery is already
[2:00:31] committed in the heart
[2:00:33] fornication is already consumed in the
[2:00:35] heart
[2:00:36] amen do you think if abraham
[2:00:40] was not sure to kill isaac god would
[2:00:43] have stopped him
[2:00:45] do you think so if he was pretending
[2:00:48] because god knows the heart amen
[2:00:51] god already seen in the heart of abraham
[2:00:55] that he was determined to kill isaac
[2:00:59] in other words in the heart of abraham
[2:01:01] isaac was already gone
[2:01:04] amen when god saw that god just stopped
[2:01:07] him
[2:01:08] from manifesting the faith that was
[2:01:11] already in his heart
[2:01:12] if god did not stop him he would have
[2:01:15] done it but
[2:01:16] amazing grace came in and provided
[2:01:18] another lamb in other words i have seen
[2:01:21] abraham in your heart that you already
[2:01:24] taken a decision
[2:01:25] to give to me the best that you got
[2:01:28] that's enough
[2:01:30] because once it's conceived there
[2:01:32] automatically you're going to produce it
[2:01:34] amen that's why imagination that
[2:01:37] meditation
[2:01:38] is very important whatever you meditate
[2:01:41] all night
[2:01:42] lord willing on sunday we already seen
[2:01:45] genesis 6
[2:01:46] where the sons of god are meditating
[2:01:50] they become brother branham say they
[2:01:51] became women chaser
[2:01:53] how can you be a child of god and turn
[2:01:56] suddenly and be
[2:01:57] and become a woman chaser brother
[2:01:59] branham explained to us that
[2:02:01] when you continue to think about
[2:02:03] something when you think about it
[2:02:05] you talk about it you think about it but
[2:02:07] i'm saying
[2:02:08] automatically you're gonna fall into
[2:02:10] that category
[2:02:11] and become what you talk about it and
[2:02:14] think about it
[2:02:15] so somehow they were meditating
[2:02:17] pondering
[2:02:18] pondering and automatically they begin
[2:02:20] to live the life
[2:02:21] and lord's willing on sunday you're
[2:02:23] going to see how a sister
[2:02:25] a child of god can get in trouble by
[2:02:28] meditating
[2:02:29] meditating what you're going to see in a
[2:02:32] scripture
[2:02:33] that's why brother branham continue to
[2:02:35] warn about the love story
[2:02:37] i love susie because you poking
[2:02:39] something in your head
[2:02:41] and you are pondering you are pondering
[2:02:44] you are pondering
[2:02:45] before you know it instead of looking at
[2:02:47] a young man
[2:02:48] that is dressed well that is responsible
[2:02:51] you begin to look at the young men that
[2:02:53] have six-pack
[2:02:56] amen that six-pack didn't come from the
[2:02:59] world
[2:03:00] that six-pack came from the movie
[2:03:02] watching
[2:03:03] that six-pack came from the kind of man
[2:03:06] you expose your mind
[2:03:08] all the time and that imprint is printed
[2:03:11] into your heart and when they say you
[2:03:13] want to get married you are looking at
[2:03:15] the man
[2:03:16] that is matching that image that's why
[2:03:19] the holy ghost
[2:03:20] have to come and destroy that image and
[2:03:23] change the heart
[2:03:24] kill that nature to show you that this
[2:03:26] is not the right kind of woman
[2:03:28] this is not the right kind of husband
[2:03:31] this is not
[2:03:31] what you needed this looks good on the
[2:03:34] inside it's going to be trouble
[2:03:35] for your life the power of meditating
[2:03:39] spend some time with the lord take some
[2:03:41] quiet
[2:03:42] time just sit quiet and think of a
[2:03:44] scripture
[2:03:45] you want to see what god is going to do
[2:03:47] i do it most of the time
[2:03:49] i just sit my wife knows it i like to be
[2:03:53] quiet
[2:03:54] when i sit quiet quiet and i begin to
[2:03:56] think on the scripture
[2:03:57] before you know it remember brother
[2:03:59] branham say this
[2:04:00] remember brother brother i'm saying this
[2:04:02] remember this scripture
[2:04:03] remember this scripture all i do is just
[2:04:05] grab a pen
[2:04:07] and i begin to write it when i give it
[2:04:09] to you you say where is he seeing that
[2:04:11] the power is on meditation but if your
[2:04:14] mind is
[2:04:15] trouble on the telephone wasting your
[2:04:18] time
[2:04:18] the lord is just look at you you're busy
[2:04:20] they look at you you're busy
[2:04:22] you are busy in the battleground amen
[2:04:25] let's stand
[2:04:26] hallelujah
[2:04:30] amen we are going through a different
[2:04:33] channel it seems like it's fire
[2:04:36] but it's just a cleansing fire amen
[2:04:40] praise the name of the lord there is a
[2:04:43] key we already explained to you on
[2:04:45] sunday why god comes around 12 years
[2:04:49] 14 because god knows
[2:04:52] and the lord dropping to me that daniel
[2:04:55] was around that same time when he went
[2:04:57] to babylon
[2:04:58] i took the quarter open and he was right
[2:05:00] there brother what i'm saying
[2:05:01] he was around 12 and 14 years when he
[2:05:04] was taken to babylon
[2:05:06] why is he matching everything teenager
[2:05:09] teenager it's just the grace of god the
[2:05:12] holy spirit to want to fight the battle
[2:05:14] for you
[2:05:14] all you have to do is just surrender
[2:05:17] just give him his place
[2:05:19] let go and let god have his own way and
[2:05:22] he's going to fight the battle
[2:05:23] but if you don't want to listen you want
[2:05:25] to fight it in yourself
[2:05:27] you're going to have scar he's going to
[2:05:29] let you go
[2:05:30] go you drink water until you completely
[2:05:32] drawn
[2:05:33] when you're tired then he just pick you
[2:05:35] up and pull you out of the water
[2:05:37] amen but if you let him fight your
[2:05:39] battle you just take the stem
[2:05:41] for the word of god like shadrach
[2:05:44] meshach abednego they were a teenager
[2:05:47] they just stood for what they know was
[2:05:50] right
[2:05:50] they didn't have a vision they didn't
[2:05:52] see any angel
[2:05:54] but because they stood for the word of
[2:05:56] god
[2:05:57] that they were taught amen when they
[2:06:00] were going through the fire
[2:06:02] god stepped in the fire amen
[2:06:06] god never took the fire away you follow
[2:06:09] me
[2:06:10] god only step in the fire and remove the
[2:06:13] heat
[2:06:14] from the fire and let go and let them go
[2:06:17] through that experience
[2:06:19] without any scar without any smell
[2:06:22] without any burning wound anything they
[2:06:25] came out
[2:06:26] right so going through teenager brother
[2:06:29] branham say
[2:06:30] it's a dangerous age we read it to you
[2:06:32] on sunday
[2:06:33] so it's a fire age that you're going
[2:06:35] through but if you're going through
[2:06:38] just take the word and stand on the word
