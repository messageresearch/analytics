[0:17] When we talk about these things, this is
[0:20] not things that we talk and you forget.
[0:23] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[0:25] &gt;&gt; David says in Psalm 119, he say, "Thy
[0:28] word have I hidden in my heart
[0:31] &gt;&gt; so that I do not sin." So whenever we
[0:34] going through these kind of things, you
[0:36] need to take them, put it in you and
[0:39] keep it and use it.
[0:41] &gt;&gt; If you just here to listen and once you
[0:43] leave here, you begin to think about
[0:45] anything else beside what was preached,
[0:48] the devil will ambush you. That's right.
[0:50] &gt;&gt; So whatever we talk about, whether we
[0:52] talk about high heel, we demonstrated,
[0:54] we put a chart on high heel, we talk
[0:57] about uh makeup, we talk about earring,
[1:00] all these kind of things, you need to
[1:01] keep it for yourself, keep the
[1:03] scripture, keep the code. So not only do
[1:06] you need it for yourself, but you need
[1:08] to teach the oncoming generation.
[1:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12] &gt;&gt; If we tell you that a boy and a girl
[1:15] should not be friend, a boy and a girl
[1:17] cannot be friend.
[1:18] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. That's right.
[1:19] Amen.
[1:21] &gt;&gt; Did you say amen?
[1:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22] &gt;&gt; Where is my friend? You there?
[1:24] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26] &gt;&gt; No. Cut it on. It's not on.
[1:28] &gt;&gt; So when you don't say amen, I'm fine. I
[1:30] got my co-pilot here. It's not on. Let
[1:33] me give you one so we can preach
[1:35] together.
[1:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40] &gt;&gt; In this church, we don't believe in boys
[1:43] and girls being friend.
[1:45] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:45] &gt;&gt; And texting each other.
[1:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50] Amen.
[1:52] &gt;&gt; Everybody okay?
[1:53] &gt;&gt; Everybody okay?
[1:55] &gt;&gt; If you have any relationship with a boy,
[1:58] you need to talk to your parent first
[2:00] &gt;&gt; and let the parent know that you are
[2:03] courting or you are in relationship with
[2:06] a boy or a young girl and your parent
[2:08] will guide you.
[2:10] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. But we don't believe in young
[2:12] sisters and young men in this message
[2:15] texting each other, calling each other
[2:17] and things like that. Parents, if you
[2:19] find those kind of relationship, cut it
[2:21] off.
[2:23] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25] &gt;&gt; If you want to have a friend, get
[2:26] married.
[2:30] &gt;&gt; If you want to have a friend, get
[2:32] married.
[2:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33] &gt;&gt; And sit with your friend and you can
[2:35] talk all day.
[2:38] And I don't have any problem with that.
[2:39] IF YOUR WIFE CALL ME SAY BROTHER STEPHEN
[2:41] MY HUSBAND talk to me all day I will be
[2:43] clapping hand
[2:44] &gt;&gt; I don't have any problem but NOT TALKING
[2:47] TO THIS SISTER AND THIS SISTER and this
[2:49] brother and this brother no sir
[2:52] &gt;&gt; under no circumstances should be in any
[2:55] relationship without your parent knowing
[2:57] that
[2:58] &gt;&gt; and parent if you know it cut it off
[3:00] because they came from the back door.
[3:02] &gt;&gt; We don't want back door relationship.
[3:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:06] &gt;&gt; We want front door relationship.
[3:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:09] If you love me, come straight.
[3:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:11] &gt;&gt; COME TO OUR HOUSE. SIT ON THE living
[3:14] room and tell me how much you love me.
[3:18] &gt;&gt; Your attention.
[3:20] &gt;&gt; Everybody okay?
[3:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:21] &gt;&gt; Everybody okay?
[3:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:22] &gt;&gt; WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE WHO are texting at
[3:24] 2:00 a.m. IN THE MORNING.
[3:26] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[3:27] &gt;&gt; WHY YOU TALKING TO A YOUNG LADY AT 2:00
[3:29] a.m.?
[3:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say at 2 a.m. the
[3:32] activity of devils are increased.
[3:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the most danger is calling you
[3:40] on FaceTime.
[3:42] &gt;&gt; To see what
[3:43] &gt;&gt; See what it
[3:47] &gt;&gt; CUT IT OFF.
[3:47] &gt;&gt; CUT IT OFF.
[3:49] &gt;&gt; Everybody okay?
[3:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:50] &gt;&gt; Cut it off.
[3:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:52] &gt;&gt; CALLING YOU ON VIDEO CALL. CUT IT OFF.
[3:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[3:57] &gt;&gt; Why do you need a video call?
[3:59] &gt;&gt; Come to our home.
[4:01] &gt;&gt; Come and see me.
[4:03] &gt;&gt; See me the way I am.
[4:05] &gt;&gt; Not the way I'm airbrushed.
[4:07] See me if I have a little pimple
[4:10] &gt;&gt; and get the package the way it is.
[4:12] &gt;&gt; Brother,
[4:14] &gt;&gt; can you say amen?
[4:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:16] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[4:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:17] &gt;&gt; So we do not believe in those kind of
[4:19] relationship.
[4:20] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[4:22] &gt;&gt; Who you who have many friends when you
[4:24] get married you're going to get in
[4:26] trouble.
[4:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[4:27] &gt;&gt; Is this 10,000 friends?
[4:29] &gt;&gt; How are you going to manage them now?
[4:30] You're married.
[4:32] &gt;&gt; How are you going to cut them off?
[4:34] &gt;&gt; So begin to
[4:35] &gt;&gt; cut them off. All right.
[4:36] &gt;&gt; Cut them off right now.
[4:38] &gt;&gt; So by the time you get married, you'll
[4:40] be free.
[4:40] &gt;&gt; And you worry about your children and
[4:42] your husband.
[4:44] &gt;&gt; Everybody okay?
[4:46] &gt;&gt; We clear so far.
[4:47] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Whether you don't say
[4:50] amen, I say amen.
[4:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:56] &gt;&gt; You want to get married, we believe in
[4:58] getting married. Very good. Go to the
[5:00] parent. Amen.
[5:02] &gt;&gt; Tell my father, "Daddy, mommy, I'm
[5:04] interested in so and so." And over
[5:06] there, they give also the report. When
[5:08] the two families are okay now, you can
[5:11] go ahead and begin to talk. And when
[5:13] it's finished, you bring it to me. We
[5:15] bring you here. Bless you. And then
[5:18] &gt;&gt; we're waiting for the remaining of the
[5:20] stuff. Everybody okay?
[5:22] &gt;&gt; That's what we want. Glory to God. Those
[5:25] who
