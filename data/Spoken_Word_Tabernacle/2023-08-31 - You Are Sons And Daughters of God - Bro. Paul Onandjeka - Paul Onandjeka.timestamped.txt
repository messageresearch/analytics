[48:29] believed not the record that God gave of
[48:32] his son
[48:39] and this is the record
[48:45] eternal life and this life is in his son
[48:57] the Son of God has not life is
[49:09] verse 13 these things have written unto
[49:12] you that believe on the name of the son
[49:15] of God that he may know that ye have
[49:18] eternal life and that he may believe on
[49:20] him of the son or you may believe on the
