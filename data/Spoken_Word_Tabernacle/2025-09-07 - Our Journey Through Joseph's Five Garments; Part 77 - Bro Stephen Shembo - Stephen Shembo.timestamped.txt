[0:00] was put on the little and the doorpost.
[0:03] The little is the cross timber and on
[0:05] the doorpost. And then the lamb was
[0:08] roasted and was and and was eaten with
[0:12] bitter herbs and they girded themselves.
[0:16] After the blood was shed and they passed
[0:18] under the shed blood, they were girded
[0:21] and ready for the march.
[0:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's a very beautiful type
[0:29] tonight of people who take communion is
[0:32] not to be associated or affiliated with
[0:36] things of the world anymore.
[0:39] &gt;&gt; They must come under the blood first and
[0:42] be cleansed from all sin which is
[0:46] unbelief and then be shoved with the
[0:50] preparation of the gospel.
[0:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. having on the whole armor of God
[0:55] ready for this summons at any time.
[1:00] &gt;&gt; And it was the the sign that the death
[1:03] angel could not go beneath that blood.
[1:07] The death angel had to rise and go over
[1:10] the blood.
[1:11] &gt;&gt; And that's where the poet got the
[1:13] inspiration saying, "When I see the
[1:16] blood, I'll pass over you."
[1:21] It was near the hour of deliverance when
[1:24] they accepted the communion, the the
[1:28] roasted lamb and the the herbs that they
[1:32] taken before leaving. Now, in the
[1:36] antitype that we're to speak of, it was
[1:39] many years ago tonight that Jesus taken
[1:44] what we know as the Lord's supper, the
[1:47] communion.
[1:49] And there's something about it that he
[1:51] was going to talk to his disciples and
[1:53] just before going away, he wanted to
[1:56] talk it over with them.

[1:01:10] welcome you.
[1:01:14] God bless you. Welcome to Spoken Word.
[1:01:16] You might be seated. Amen. You can say
[1:01:19] amen. You can shout, you can run, you
[1:01:22] can dance. You are not a visitor. You
[1:01:24] are a family member. Amen. So, welcome
[1:01:27] and fill a home and all new subscriber,
[1:01:29] God richly bless you and welcome to
[1:01:31] Spoken Word Tabernacle. I believe we are
[1:01:34] all up to date with the sermon. We're
[1:01:36] reading our Bible twice a day, our Cood
[1:01:39] book, Church Ages. It's amazing how the
[1:01:42] young children are picking up on the
[1:01:44] church ages. It's it's so beautiful.
[1:01:46] Amen.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; This is not a Catholic uh place where
[1:01:50] the priest has a different book than the
[1:01:52] congregation.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; You read what I read and then when we
[1:01:56] come together and the Holy Spirit
[1:01:58] catches up then it's a different story
[1:02:00] all together. Amen.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; So we're reading our seals our 70 weeks
[1:02:04] of Daniel adoption or somebody is
[1:02:07] listening to the message of the hour. I
[1:02:10] used to put brother Brandham I usually
[1:02:11] put brother Brandham and sometime I go
[1:02:13] to sleep and the tape is playing and
[1:02:15] finally recently I saw a quote where
[1:02:17] brother Brandham say he used to read his
[1:02:20] Bible and then fall asleep. I say okay
[1:02:22] now I have a quote to back me up. If
[1:02:25] somebody have a problem they say but
[1:02:27] Stephen you're sleeping listening to the
[1:02:28] word. Of course sometime we can be worn
[1:02:31] out but I rather go to sleep thinking
[1:02:34] meditating on the word because there is
[1:02:37] a key to that. If you go to the book of
[1:02:38] Daniel, you notice that Nebuchadnezzar
[1:02:41] the king was meditating
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; on certain thing before he slept
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; and the Holy Spirit use that
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; to bring him the vision.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Go verify and you will see it. Amen.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Going through my announcement, married
[1:02:57] couple meeting September the 20th. It's
[1:02:59] coming sooner. Part seven and then
[1:03:02] December the 13th part eight because we
[1:03:04] got to secure the facility. Young
[1:03:06] Sisters meeting, it's September the
[1:03:08] 27th. If any more question, go ahead and
[1:03:11] put it in so we get ready for it. And
[1:03:13] October the 11th, question and answer.
[1:03:16] Youngsmen, October the 25th for part
[1:03:19] three on courtship sheep and for the
[1:03:21] building. You keep praying. There's
[1:03:23] still a little bit of work to do up
[1:03:25] there. Once we finish, we will be clear
[1:03:27] for the final inspection and we move the
[1:03:30] Abraham Lincoln uh toward the fellowship
[1:03:34] hall. Amen.
[1:03:35] God is doing things that is beyond my
[1:03:39] understanding.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; it might make sense to you, but to me it
[1:03:43] doesn't make sense. All I can see is a
[1:03:45] divine hand of God.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; We've been reminding contractor over and
[1:03:50] over and they keep waving and sometime
[1:03:52] they lose the um what do you call it the
[1:03:57] uh the plan and uh and and the drawing
[1:04:00] and then they come back they say can you
[1:04:02] send the drawing again? And we say,
[1:04:03] "Wait a minute. We already sent the
[1:04:04] drawing, so we go back. It's a battle."
[1:04:07] Amen.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; But God is moving in a supernatural way.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; So, uh, the man that was supposed to do
[1:04:15] the framing outside and the and the
[1:04:17] foundation, he does the framing and the
[1:04:19] u the metal framing and the and the
[1:04:22] foundation and he goes with the
[1:04:24] rock. It's one one contractor he doing.
[1:04:26] He does all of that. He's the one that
[1:04:27] did the work there. Everything looks
[1:04:29] smooth and very good. That's the man
[1:04:31] that did it. So I keep reminding him. I
[1:04:34] keep reminding him. I keep reminding him
[1:04:36] and you know your pastor and I learned
[1:04:38] that from the scripture. You got to keep
[1:04:40] going to the judge until the door open
[1:04:43] up. So uh on Tuesday I send him a
[1:04:47] message to remind him and I told him
[1:04:50] send him like hey we still need the code
[1:04:52] for the connector up there. The wall is
[1:04:53] already erected if we can begin to frame

[1:05:11] the man
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; by working on this building right here.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Let's Can you say amen?
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Uh the Lord begin to bless the man. He
[1:05:23] said, "Pastor, I have so much work. I
[1:05:26] don't even have time. Let's do this.
[1:05:29] Let's do what? He say, "You go buy the
[1:05:32] material. I'm going to send the man to
[1:05:35] do the work for you. Just pay them. You
[1:05:37] don't need to pay me.

[1:06:04] this and this. Get the material. As soon
[1:06:07] as you get it, give me a call. I send my
[1:06:09] crew. You pay them.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; You don't pay me and you do the work.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He said, "Patro, by the way,
[1:06:15] how about the fellowship hall?" I say,
[1:06:17] "You know what? I'm just I'm I'm still
[1:06:20] building up the money. I have $17,000."
[1:06:24] He said, "Wait a minute. I was waiting
[1:06:25] for 12,000. Then we can start the work
[1:06:28] and the remaining we can go later on.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Church, I hope you're understanding what
[1:06:40] I'm saying.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; This is a miracle from God.
[1:06:44] So, I'm not looking at how much money we
[1:06:46] have in the car. I'm looking at the big
[1:06:49] God that we serving.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; And it's God doing all of this.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; God has been so merciful to us that we
[1:07:00] saving thousands of dollar. He know
[1:07:02] where we are, but it's our season to be
[1:07:05] blessed.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; So, just keep praying. Keep doing what
[1:07:11] you're doing. By God's grace, one of
[1:07:13] these day you will see the lenon begin
[1:07:15] to work over there. Just know we are
[1:07:17] shooting things over there. Amen.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; All we need is just to make a list,
[1:07:25] order it, get the material and the guys
[1:07:27] come there. So sometime those lingering
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; those forgetting of the plan and missing
[1:07:36] the plan were necessary
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; because if he would have give me the
[1:07:40] plan when I asked for it he would have
[1:07:43] put his own commission in the plan
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; but because of the difficulty that is
[1:07:47] happen the trial that is happening
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; that get us upset sometime it's working
[1:07:53] together for good it got him so tired
[1:07:56] and weary until he doesn't want to deal
[1:07:59] with it anymore. That's why the Bible
[1:08:01] say all things are working together for
[1:08:03] good.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; Even if it's a stop, hold on. There is a
[1:08:08] blessing behind it.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:10:08] Let's go straight to the reading of our
[1:10:10] scripture. I was trying to read one
[1:10:11] scripture and I sat there. The Holy
[1:10:14] Spirit brought another other scripture
[1:10:16] to read. So I don't have any choice. I
[1:10:18] got to obey the spirit of the Lord.
[1:10:20] Amen.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Uh let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[1:10:27] are approaching you humbly again this
[1:10:29] morning. Father, thanking you for your
[1:10:31] grace, your love, your mercy, and for
[1:10:33] everything you have been doing for us.
[1:10:35] Father, this is as far as I can go with
[1:10:38] the ability you have given me. But when
[1:10:40] it comes to ministering to your
[1:10:42] children, he only take the supernatural
[1:10:44] action of the Holy Spirit. Lord, may you
[1:10:47] come and move me and the congregation
[1:10:49] completely out of the way. May the
[1:10:51] windows of heaven be open up. May you
[1:10:53] pour your blessing again. May you bless
[1:10:55] us and touch every area, every aspect of
[1:10:58] our life and speak to our soul. Father,
[1:11:00] be the alpha and the omega, the
[1:11:02] beginning and the ending of this
[1:11:04] service. Bless those that are here and
[1:11:06] the church online, Lord. Father, the
[1:11:08] invisible audience in the name of Jesus
[1:11:11] Christ. Amen.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Genesis 37.
[1:11:17] My theme this morning, if the Lord
[1:11:20] allow,
[1:11:24] it's the wisdom.
[1:11:28] Hallelujah.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; The wisdom of Isachar.
[1:11:36] the wisdom of Issachar
[1:11:39] in seasons.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; So we are picking up from where we get
[1:11:46] there is a wisdom that goes with
[1:11:48] Issachar. But before we get there, let's
[1:11:50] go to Genesis 37. Very familiar because
[1:11:54] we are still on the series. If you need
[1:11:56] the title quick the Bible uh the title
[1:12:00] is our life journey through Joseph five
[1:12:03] garment part 77 27
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Glory to God let's go to Genesis 37 very
[1:12:13] familiar very easy I'm just touching
[1:12:15] point here then we take off verse one
[1:12:18] and Jacob dwell in the land wherein his
[1:12:21] father was a stranger in the land of
[1:12:25] Canaan. You might be seated.
[1:12:28] Verse two. These are the generations of
[1:12:31] Jacob. Joseph being 17 years old was
[1:12:36] feeding the flock with his brethren. So
[1:12:39] he had a responsibility.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; And the lad was with the sons of Bill
[1:12:44] and with the sons of Zilpa, his father's
[1:12:47] wife. And Joseph brought to his father
[1:12:51] the evil report. This is where I'm
[1:12:54] getting now. Israel loved Jacob more
[1:12:58] than all his children.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Joseph,
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; he loved Jacob more. He loved Joseph
[1:13:07] more than what?
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; All his children.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; Somebody's really awake.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Now, Israel loved Joseph more than all
[1:13:16] his children. So, at home,
[1:13:20] Joseph was favored.
[1:13:25] I pray God if I can reach where I'm
[1:13:27] trying to go
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; and I pray God we stay synchronized
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; with the spirit of the Lord.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; So at home
[1:13:36] Joseph is favored.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; He found grace.
[1:13:43] He's loved above everybody.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. because he was the son of his old
[1:13:50] age and he made him a coat of many
[1:13:55] colors. So from home we can see the
[1:13:58] difference
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; with the life of Joseph.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; There is something special about this
[1:14:03] boy that when he came all attention
[1:14:08] I turned completely toward him.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Job 2:4.
[1:14:14] And when his brethren saw that their
[1:14:17] father love him more than all his
[1:14:19] brethren. Normal my friend. Amen.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; You happy? Daddy love me. Daddy love me.
[1:14:25] Just know there is something else that
[1:14:26] come with daddy love me.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; The Lord love me. The Lord bless me. The
[1:14:30] Lord bless me. Just know there is
[1:14:32] something else.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; Ah not just the Lord love me.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; If you see somebody mad, just understand
[1:14:38] he goes with the Lord love me.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. Amen.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; We're not in heaven.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; we are not in heaven. We are on earth.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Somebody will be happy. Somebody will be
[1:14:52] mad.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; H you got to go with both of them.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; But what you need to do is being
[1:15:00] unconscious
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; of those that are mad.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Because by being mad at you, they are
[1:15:09] mad at God.
[1:15:11] Because what you are is God that gave
[1:15:13] you.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. And the Bible says, "And uh when
[1:15:22] his brethren saw that their father loved
[1:15:24] him more than all his brethren, they
[1:15:27] hated him.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; This is his brother.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Not his not a neighbor. the brother.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; I don't know why this is happening to
[1:15:42] me. I didn't do anything. I was just
[1:15:43] shaking the hand.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Grow up.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Not everybody will stand. What's going
[1:15:53] on with you?
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; Did you fabricate your voice?
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Did you fabricate your voice?
[1:16:05] Did you sit down and say, "Let me open
[1:16:07] my cord and then make sure that I'm a
[1:16:09] good singer." No. So why should we have
[1:16:11] a problem with your singing?
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; It is God who who who created brother
[1:16:19] Angelo with that voice.
[1:16:22] [Music]
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if he sing and the anointing
[1:16:29] comes downless,
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; enjoy the anointing.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; He say
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; and they hated him and could not speak
[1:16:47] to him. What? Peacefully.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Peacefully.
[1:16:52] God bless. God bless you, sister. Bless
[1:16:54] you.
[1:16:57] Leave it alone.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Maybe they got a problem with your
[1:17:02] dress.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; I don't know where those are coming up.
[1:17:10] I'm just warming the airplane.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; What you need to do is go and say,
[1:17:16] "Sister,
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; I love the way you dress.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Can you help me also dress and get some
[1:17:23] nice dresses like you?
[1:17:26] That's it.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; I don't see what is special about it.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; You just got it.
[1:17:36] [Laughter]
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; Okay, that's your problem. Verse six.
[1:17:42] And he says to them,
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; "Here, I pray you the dream." Oh, verse
[1:17:47] five. And Joseph dreamed a dream and he
[1:17:51] told
[1:17:53] it his brethren and they hated him yet
[1:17:56] the more.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; This dream here were not fabricated by
[1:18:01] Joseph.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; There I mean uh these dreams were given
[1:18:05] by God. Amen.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; So we see that not only was he favored
[1:18:10] and had the grace, but there was a
[1:18:13] divine presence
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; of God
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; with this boy.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; And the divine presence was expressed
[1:18:22] through the gift.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; God was with this man.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; We clear?
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; We clear?
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Okay. Let's go to Genesis 39. It's a
[1:18:34] short reading. It's not like uh the
[1:18:38] slugger.
[1:18:43] Genesis 39. If you dare, you can say
[1:18:46] amen.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; And Joseph was brought down to Egypt.
[1:18:52] And Piper, an officer of Pharaoh, we're
[1:18:55] in Joseph series anyway, captain of the
[1:18:58] guard, an Egyptian, brought him of the
[1:19:01] hands of the Ishelat, which had brought
[1:19:04] him down there. So he moved from home to
[1:19:08] Egypt
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; and precisely in the house of an
[1:19:13] Egyptian. So he's no longer a home.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; The setting have changed.
[1:19:20] He's outside
[1:19:22] of his comfort zone.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Of his comfort zone. Are we together?
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Over here, we can testify God is there.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Now, he's right here and the state that
[1:19:39] he's on. He's a slave
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; over here. He was a free man. That's
[1:19:44] right.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; A child that was loved by his father
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; over here. He's a slave.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; You would thought because he's switching
[1:19:55] God left him.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Verse two. And the Lord was with Joseph.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; We clear now? So even in Egypt,
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; God was there.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; I hope we are talking to somebody.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; We find again a divine presence here.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Even in Egypt,
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; even in Egypt.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; Beautiful.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; If he was us, we would have focused on
[1:20:32] the fact that I'm a slave.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Correct. Amen. Amen.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; We will dwell every day
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; in the fact that my brother sold me.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; They to lie on me.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; They betray me.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Everybody you meet at Walmart, my
[1:20:50] father, my brother betray me. My brother
[1:20:53] sold me. And that's the reason why I am
[1:20:56] here.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; If you fail in school, my brother hated
[1:21:00] me. My brother sold me. That's the
[1:21:03] reason why I am here.
[1:21:07] If you didn't sleep at night, my the
[1:21:09] whole story.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm a slave. I'm a sl everywhere.
[1:21:17] I'm a slave.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Why are you a slave? My brother back in
[1:21:22] the day.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:21:25] Back in 1952,
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; my uncle molestated me.
[1:21:36] Let the anchor go.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Free yourself.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Sister Adessa, please refocus. Amen.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; We found that the Lord was with Joseph
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; and he was a
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; poor man.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; he was what? prospers
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; in Canaan.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; In Egypt,
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; where in Egypt
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; as a free man?
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; As a slave.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; He was prosperous as a what?
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; As a slave.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; In his own house.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; In somebody else house,
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; but he's prosperous.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; I hope we getting the message
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; because according to us, you need to be
[1:22:22] home.
[1:22:25] We desire to be home
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; close to our father
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; to be prosper.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; We found him slave.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Not his home.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; But what happened? He was a prosperous
[1:22:40] man.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; As a slave,
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; not a home in the house of a master.
[1:22:48] Right.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; As a worker,
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; not a free worker, a slave.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Yet God presence is there.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; So God presence doesn't depend on the
[1:23:03] geographical.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Ah, no problem, my friend. Let's keep
[1:23:14] moving. And he was in the house of his
[1:23:18] master. What?
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; The Egyptian.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Not his own house.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Verse three. And his master. So
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; this boy was so special.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; That even the master.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; So it doesn't matter where you put
[1:23:36] Joseph.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter where you put Joseph.
[1:23:44] The problem is not the location. The
[1:23:46] problem is himself.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; It's Joseph.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is following Joseph.
[1:23:52] [Music]
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Even if you go through the valley of the
[1:23:56] shadow of death, the Holy Spirit is
[1:23:58] following Joseph.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; The problem is not the location. The
[1:24:02] problem is you.
[1:24:05] [Music]
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; The problem is not the wilderness. The
[1:24:10] problem is who's crossing the
[1:24:12] wilderness.
[1:24:13] If it's Israel, you don't worry about
[1:24:16] the wilderness
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; because the rock will produce water.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; In the wilderness,
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; Father, help us.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Let's go to verse uh uh three. And his
[1:24:31] master saw that the Lord was with him
[1:24:34] and the Lord and that the Lord made
[1:24:36] what?
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; All he did
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; that he did to do what? prosper in his
[1:24:40] hand
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; in in in Canaan or in Egypt?
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; In Egypt
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; instead of focusing on the slavery
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; and the hatred.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, the hatred
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; was necessary to change the season.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:08] Let me continue
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; verse four. And Joseph found grace
[1:25:14] where?
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; In his sight.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; And serve him. And he made him overseer
[1:25:18] over his house. And all that he have he
[1:25:21] put where?
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; In his hands.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; We clear so far?
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; We clear so far.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Now drop to verse uh 20.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; We going very quick. Praise God.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; And Joseph master took him.
[1:25:39] Are we together? Yes, sir.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; And put him where?
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; Into a prison.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; So, Joseph now is no longer in a house.
[1:25:45] Where is he at?
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Prison.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; From the Egyptian house. Now, Joseph is
[1:25:53] where?
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; Prison.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; It looks like Joseph is dropping below.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; From home
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; to a slavery. from slavery. Instead of
[1:26:07] going right up, he goes down again.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; But let's see where God is
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; because God is in the elevator with
[1:26:16] Joseph.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; As Joseph is coming down the elevator,
[1:26:19] God is also in the elevator.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Verse 20.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; And Joseph master did what?
[1:26:30] took him and put him into the prison. A
[1:26:33] place where the king's prisoner were
[1:26:35] bound. And he was there where?
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; In the prison.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Is it the appropriate place?
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Is it a nice place?
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, pify place was even
[1:26:44] better.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Now I'm in the prison
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; for something I didn't do.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; And the same situation again happened.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Somebody told lie on me.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Yes. using my mentor.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; My brother took my mentor
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; and put blood and told lie to my father.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Now a woman took my mentor
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; and went and took and put lie. What
[1:27:09] curse is going on in my life?
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Was it a curse?
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; So remove from your mind that you under
[1:27:20] a curse.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. because something happened to you.
[1:27:29] [Laughter]
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Let's go to verse uh
[1:27:37] uh uh 21. But but it's a it goes as a
[1:27:42] contradiction.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; But what
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; the Lord was with Joseph.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; The Lord was with Joseph where?
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; In prison.
[1:27:52] So in prison
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; again we find a divine presence.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; So God is not only where you think he
[1:28:06] is.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; When everything is going good, nobody
[1:28:12] get sick, all is well, then God is with
[1:28:14] me.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:18] The Bible say, "But the Lord was with
[1:28:20] Joseph and showed him mercy."
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; "And gave him what?"
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; Favor
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; in the sight of what?
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; The keeper of the prison.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; How can a prisoner
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; prosper?
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; I feel like I'm in a prison.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Your prison is a different prison.
[1:28:45] Watch what you do in prison.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Don't focus on the prison.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; Don't focus on the building of the
[1:28:52] prison.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Uh uh let's go. And the keeper of the
[1:29:00] prison committed to Joseph handwater.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; All the prisoners.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; How can they commit to a prisoner at the
[1:29:08] prisoner?
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; You you have a jailbreak.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; Correct.
[1:29:15] [Laughter]
[1:29:19] Amen.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; He says that and the keeper of the
[1:29:23] prison did what?
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Committed to the Joseph's
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that
[1:29:29] were in the prison. And whatsoever they
[1:29:33] did there, he was the what?
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; The doer of
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; So now who was in charge of the prison?
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Joseph. So, was the prison really a
[1:29:42] prison or another promotion to a manager
[1:29:45] position?
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; It depends on how you reading it.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; If it was me and you, I'm in prison
[1:29:55] right here. I'm in prison right here.
[1:29:57] I'm in this place right here. Wake up.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Forget about the prison.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; The footstep of the righteous.
[1:30:05] [Applause]
[1:30:08] In other word, God doesn't take you to a
[1:30:10] place just like that.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Job 2 verse uh 23. The keeper of the
[1:30:22] prison look not to anything.
[1:30:26] What a confidence.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; A man that was bought to try to try to
[1:30:31] rape somebody else's wife.
[1:30:33] [Laughter]
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. That's what the Bible
[1:30:38] says.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Why is he in prison? He was trying to
[1:30:41] rape his master.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; And they took and they give that man uh
[1:30:48] I mean I mean a manager in prison.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; And they don't even control him.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Never fight when you know you are
[1:30:58] innocent.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Stay calm.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; When you know you are innocent,
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; just stay calm.
[1:31:08] When you know you didn't do anything
[1:31:09] wrong,
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; hush.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Live your life.
[1:31:14] [Music]
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; It's just a matter of time.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; He said the keeper of the prison looked
[1:31:21] not to anything that was under his hand
[1:31:24] because of what?
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; The Lord was with him.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; So the keeper of the prison testify of
[1:31:30] the presence of God, the divine presence
[1:31:33] of God with this boy. Yes.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; He says, "And that which he did, the
[1:31:40] Lord made it how?"
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; To prosper.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; So he prospered where?
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Everywhere.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Everywhere.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; In prison. How can you prosper in
[1:31:47] prison?
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Favor.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; Is my Bible different than yours?
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Favor in prison.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; And not only pray favor, but he prosper.
[1:32:00] How can you be in prison and prospering?
[1:32:02] Right.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; It's a paradox.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; The lesson I'm trying to draw right here
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; is no matter where Joseph is,
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; God is there.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; So, you have a choice to focus on the
[1:32:23] presence of God
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; or on the state or condition you find
[1:32:29] yourself in.
[1:32:32] It's a matter of choice.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; It's a matter of choice between
[1:32:37] condition,
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; between circumstances.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Between the trial,
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; between the state
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; or between the divine presence of God.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:58] If you focus and the devil want you to
[1:33:01] focus
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; on the fact that you in prison
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; the devil want you whenever you speak
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; mention to people
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; that remember me in prayer you know I'm
[1:33:15] in prison
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; Jesus there it is
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; remember me in prayer you know I'm a I'm
[1:33:24] a slave in Joseph home right so keep me
[1:33:27] in prayer. I know one day the Lord will
[1:33:30] do something for you.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; So all your friend will be calling you
[1:33:35] just to comfort you every day.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; How are you doing? Keep a good morale.
[1:33:41] Everything will be okay. One of this day
[1:33:44] you will come up there.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; That's what the devil want you to do.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; In other words, keep busy on the
[1:33:53] negative side.
[1:34:00] Are we together? And when you focus on
[1:34:02] the negative side, you will miss the
[1:34:05] positive side that is in that negative
[1:34:09] place.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; I don't know if we are together.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; You can look either either you stay on
[1:34:20] the negative side
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; or you look at the positive side. Yes.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; When you begin to look at the positive
[1:34:26] side,
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; then you are in prison, but you don't
[1:34:30] have shackles.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Shake somebody's hand, my friend.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; It's a prison,
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; but you are free.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; It's a prison, but you are walking.
[1:34:50] Amen.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; It's a prison, but you are working like
[1:34:54] a manager.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; But you are in prison.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Focus on that.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:35:01] [Music]
[1:35:02] [Applause]
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Charles Senior.
[1:35:09] God bless you, brother Steven. Where are
[1:35:11] you at? In prison.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Okay. In prison. Do you have shackles?
[1:35:17] No.
[1:35:19] Did they lock you up? No.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; Do they give you food at a certain time?
[1:35:23] No.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; So, what are you doing in prison? No.
[1:35:26] I'm a free I'm a manager right here. I'm
[1:35:28] taking care of uh the inventory and I'm
[1:35:31] giving food.
[1:35:34] [Applause]
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; If you look in between the line, it is
[1:35:39] not a prison.
[1:35:42] It is a preparation step
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; that God has put you
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; to get you somewhere.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; The devil want you to look at prison.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; The devil want you to look at a master's
[1:36:02] house, a slave.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; God want you to focus on I put you here
[1:36:08] for a training.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; There is a bigger job ahead.
[1:36:13] Yes sir. That's exactly right. That's
[1:36:16] exactly right.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Let me ask you a question.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; If Joseph have traveled himself to
[1:36:25] Egypt, now this is off my note.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; And he's a free man in Egypt
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; and he get a job.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; Joseph can do what he want.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; He can even quit the job. He can even
[1:36:36] leave the job and go hang out on
[1:36:39] downtown and at at uh at at 11:00 p.m.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; But because he's a slave,
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; God put those restraint.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; It is God that put the restraint. Yes,
[1:36:50] sir.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; You think it's a restraint. No, no, no,
[1:36:52] no, no, no, no. God want you to stay
[1:36:54] focused.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; God knows if he give you too much
[1:36:57] liberty,
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; you will miss your preparation.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; You miss it.
[1:37:04] Young people, do you get me?
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; It is not a blockage on liberty. Watch
[1:37:09] what God is doing.
[1:37:11] [Applause]
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; When Joseph begin to prosper
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; in the house of Pifer
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; and Porifer say, "You know what? My bank
[1:37:24] account is right here."
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; In the morning, Joseph is on the in the
[1:37:28] Cadillac going to Bank of America. He
[1:37:30] get there. Joseph. Everybody in Bank of
[1:37:32] America knows him. Everybody in W Fargo
[1:37:35] knows him. God say too much liberty.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Now he begin to get popular in the city.
[1:37:42] Let me decrease the liberty. Remove him
[1:37:45] from there. Put him in prison so he
[1:37:48] won't go again at Bank of America.
[1:37:55] [Applause]
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. Oh God, why did
[1:38:01] you bring me down here? No, here in
[1:38:03] prison, you don't go out too much.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; You going to focus on the manager
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; because on the future, you going to be
[1:38:11] the manager of the entire world.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; Before I put that big responsibility in
[1:38:22] your hand,
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; I must make sure you are well prepared.
[1:38:27] You must learn discipline as a slave.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; It was a season of preparation.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; And all and the shifting of this season
[1:38:48] from one season to another. It always
[1:38:51] takes trial.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:38:56] To move from one season to another, it's
[1:38:59] a trial.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; To move from another season to the
[1:39:02] prison, it's a trial.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; And to move from the prison to the
[1:39:06] presence of Pharaoh, there was another
[1:39:08] trial.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; He put his confidence in the man
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; and the man forgot about him for two
[1:39:17] years.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; He went through another trial.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; So it's trial that is making you shift.
[1:39:26] Amen.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; You didn't get that, my friend. So, when
[1:39:30] a trial is coming in your life, get
[1:39:33] ready to shift.
[1:39:44] is coming. The eagle get in the storm
[1:39:47] and the storm take the eagle up.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; The eagle doesn't run away from storm.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; You face the storm because the storm
[1:39:59] usually carry you to a next step.
[1:40:03] [Music]
[1:40:04] [Applause]
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; Two things my friend. condition,
[1:40:12] circumstances, trial, state versus the
[1:40:15] divine presence of God.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; The devil want you to focus right here.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; The devil doesn't want you to focus here
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; because if you focus here, you're going
[1:40:24] to miss the time.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Every time you going through a season,
[1:40:28] there is a time.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; There is a time associated.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; Maybe this is two years. This is three
[1:40:35] years. In two years, if you focus on the
[1:40:38] negative, you miss everything the Holy
[1:40:40] Spirit was putting there.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; And when you go to the fourth grade,
[1:40:44] you're going to flunk
[1:40:46] it
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; because you failed to overcome that
[1:40:49] season.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; There is
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; and to carry what you overcome to move
[1:40:52] to the next step.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Now, let's go to our reading today. That
[1:40:58] was what was given to me this morning.
[1:41:00] Now, let's go to our reading in 2
[1:41:02] Chronicle 12. That's the only reading.
[1:41:06] Amen.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Whoever is sleeping, shake yourself.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Wake them up. Wake them up.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; I was reading a quote. Brother Brandham
[1:41:22] say, "If a doctor tells you what to do,
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; and you don't do what the doctor tells
[1:41:26] you,
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; it is your own responsibility."
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; So now, the Holy Spirit is trying to
[1:41:31] help you on what to do.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the devil is trying to make
[1:41:34] you sleepy.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; And tomorrow, when did you preach about
[1:41:41] that?
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Now I have to go back online and search
[1:41:44] the sermon for you.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; You do it yourself.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; Uh 1 Chronicles 12
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; verse 32. If you dare, you can say amen.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. chapter 1 Chronicle chapter 2
[1:42:02] chapter 12 verse 32 sorry
[1:42:06] thank you
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; 1 Chronicle 12:32
[1:42:11] then we soar but you will need your
[1:42:14] Bible
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; because we're going to get into
[1:42:16] something amen
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; and the children of what
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; issakar
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Issachar which were men that had water
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; understanding
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; there is two things about the wisdom of
[1:42:28] Issachar car is a car has understanding.
[1:42:32] The word understanding,
[1:42:35] the true word is discernment.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; They had discernment of what?
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; The times.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; That word times
[1:42:46] goes with season.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Go ahead, my friend. The discernment of
[1:42:53] uh time. come
[1:42:56] an understanding of time to know what
[1:42:59] what
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Israel ought to do.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; The second thing on Issachar, they know
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; what to do.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Ought to do. In other words, they don't
[1:43:12] just discern the season.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; Now, hey, I'm in party for house.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; But what should I do?
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; There it is. Amen.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; What should I do in house?
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; That's the problem. So, is tells you it
[1:43:28] indicate this is the time
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; and based on this, this is the way you
[1:43:34] need to behave right now
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; based on the season
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; because the season bring its own
[1:43:39] blessing.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; So, you need to know what to do
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; according to the season.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you don't know what the season
[1:43:51] is,
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; you already lost.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; But if you know, but what should I do
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; based on this? If the alarm sound, what
[1:43:58] should I do?
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; If I found out it's a cancer, what
[1:44:03] should I do?
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; If it's a tuberculosis, what should I
[1:44:06] do?
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; Diagnosis is fine.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; It's one step, but the next step is what
[1:44:11] do you do now? Amen.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; A doctor must first diagnose
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; and then know the treatment to
[1:44:18] administer based on the diagnosis.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; So the wisdom of Issachar tells you the
[1:44:25] time and he also tell you what to do.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; The Bible say to know what Israel ought
[1:44:35] to do. The heads of them were what? 200
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; men and all their brethren were at their
[1:44:41] water
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; commandment
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; so far. Let's stop right there.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; The wisdom of Issachar that we talking
[1:44:48] about here in season is a wisdom that
[1:44:51] first discern the season.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; And after discernment, he goes ahead and
[1:44:56] give you instruction.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; He gives instruction.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; On what to do. Because if you don't know
[1:45:08] what to do, you are lost.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; You are filled only with knowledge.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; That's correct. Amen.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; You are stuck in faith.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; But you don't have works.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; And then faith without work is dead.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; You need to have faith.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; And you need to have works.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; You need to know what it is. And what
[1:45:33] are you supposed to do?
[1:45:36] Are we together?
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says this. Glory to God.
[1:45:40] In the message God's provided approach
[1:45:42] to divine fellowship. Brother Brham said
[1:45:44] there is so much of it today. There is
[1:45:47] so many of us. If someone say what can I
[1:45:51] do to be saved,
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; what do we tell them?
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; Quit your lying
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; and then what?
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Quit your stealing
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; and what?
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Quit your smoking
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; and what?
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; Quit your drinking.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; I believe they should do that too. But
[1:46:04] that does not answer his question.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; The question is what must I do?
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; You begin to tell.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; Let me read brother Brandham. Brother
[1:46:20] Brandham said but that does not answer
[1:46:22] what
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; his question.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; You are telling him what not to do.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; He wants to know what to do.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together? You are telling me quit
[1:46:34] lying. Okay, quit lying. So what is
[1:46:36] next? Quit smoking.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; And then what is next? Before you know
[1:46:40] it, I have a long list of quit, quit,
[1:46:42] quit, quit, quit, quit, quit. The
[1:46:43] problem is what should I do?
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; I need to know what to do.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; Brother said, Paul said to the
[1:46:54] Philippian jailer, he never told him,
[1:46:57] put up your sword
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; and do all this and the other. He said
[1:47:02] what?
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; and thou shalt be saved. Thou and thy
[1:47:06] house believe and do what?
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Have faith.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; Paul never say quit lying, put your
[1:47:11] soul, do this. No, he went straight to
[1:47:13] the point and give the necessary
[1:47:16] instruction.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; The appropriate instruction
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; to get the job done.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together? We know that according
[1:47:25] to Ecclesiastes 3:1 to everything
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; there is a season.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; When he says everything, it's
[1:47:36] everything.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; It is even beyond what you have in your
[1:47:40] mind.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; Everything have a season.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; Everything.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; And by knowing that everything have a
[1:47:48] season, it brings hope.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:55] I don't know if you get it.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; When I know that everything have a
[1:47:59] season,
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; it brings hope
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; because I know that if I'm going through
[1:48:05] a bad time,
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; whatever I'm going through has a season.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; In other words, whatever I'm going
[1:48:16] through must stop somewhere.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; It's not going to stay eternal. After a
[1:48:21] while, I'm going to come out of it.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says this in the message,
[1:48:32] "The hour is come."
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; He says, "It came time, one time for the
[1:48:37] children of Israel to be what?
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; Delivered from
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; delivered from the Egyptian bondage. And
[1:48:43] when the time of the promise drew nigh,
[1:48:46] they raised up a pharaoh who did not
[1:48:49] know Joseph.
[1:48:51] Why?
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; The season was there.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; They respected Israel until that time.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; But the season was there for no more
[1:49:05] respect.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; So there was a season to be respected.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; And there is a season not to be
[1:49:16] respected. If you going through a time
[1:49:19] where people are talking about you, just
[1:49:21] remember there is a season.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Put your seat belts, my friend. I'm
[1:49:29] going to take off from the airport.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; There is a season people will respect
[1:49:33] you.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; And there is another season people will
[1:49:36] not respect you. No matter what you do,
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; no matter how much you beg them,
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; how much you babysit them,
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; whatever you do, it's not working. Amen.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; Do not get frustrated at them.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; Remember, it's a season.
[1:49:52] [Applause]
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; Why is it a season? It brings me hope
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; that sooner I'm going to get out of
[1:50:00] this.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; The Bible says this. Brother Brandham
[1:50:03] continue. He says that God could shower
[1:50:06] down his judgment upon the people. The
[1:50:09] time had come. In Hebrew 12:2, the Bible
[1:50:12] say looking unto who?
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Jesus. In other words, focus on Jesus.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; Turn. In other words, turn from
[1:50:20] everything else.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Paul say look unto Jesus.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; What do you want us to look in Jesus?
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; Paul is explaining. Paul is saying that
[1:50:30] looking unto Jesus who is what?
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; The author.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; He's the alpha and the what?
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; Finisher
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; of what?
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; Of faith.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; So who start your faith?
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; So who's supposed to bring you to
[1:50:41] perfection?
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; Jesus. So what do you have to do for
[1:50:44] yourself?
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; So who start your journey?
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; Who finished your journey?
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; So what do you have to worry about it?
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; You don't.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; And the Bible say Jesus who is the
[1:51:00] author and the finisher of our faith who
[1:51:03] for the joy
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; that was set where
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; before
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; he did what?
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; Endured the cross. So Jesus before he
[1:51:13] endured the cross.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; He saw something.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; I'm reading the Bible.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; Because you say, "Oh, Jesus went through
[1:51:23] the cross and then he was and they beat
[1:51:26] him. He didn't say nothing and then they
[1:51:28] spit on him and Jesus was quiet." Jesus
[1:51:31] was doing that for a reason.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. Jesus saw
[1:51:39] another season.
[1:51:46] [Laughter]
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; The Bible say for the joy that was what?
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; Set before him.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; He did what?
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; Endure the cross.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; So the strength to endure the cross
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; came from the vision that he saw ahead.
[1:52:03] [Applause]
[1:52:07] In other words, because of what I'm
[1:52:09] going to get there, because of the
[1:52:11] degree I will get there,
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; I'm not worrying about how much I don't
[1:52:15] sleep at night.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; I might be staying all night studying.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; But that's not a problem because I'm
[1:52:22] looking at the degree.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; I'm looking at the diploma.
[1:52:26] [Applause]
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together. Amen.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; You think Jesus just went like that?
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; Remember the pillar of fire left him.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. That's right,
[1:52:38] brother.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; So Jesus went to the cross without the
[1:52:42] pillar of fire.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; My friend, is my Bible different?
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; God left Jesus Christ.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; You ready?
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; Are you ready? Yeah.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; Jesus went to the cross without the Holy
[1:53:00] Ghost.
[1:53:06] [Music]
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; I'm waiting. The pillar of fire left
[1:53:11] him. That's why he said, "My father, my
[1:53:13] father, the father left him. He overcome
[1:53:16] the devil without the Holy Ghost."
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:29] Are we together?
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; He didn't have the fullness of the
[1:53:34] Godhead badly.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; But what kept him going,
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; it was what he saw ahead.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; The vision he saw ahead gave him
[1:53:45] strength.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together. In other
[1:53:50] words, Lord, because of what I'm going
[1:53:52] to get,
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; I don't care what's going on.
[1:53:56] [Applause]
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; It's very easy. You say Jesus was God.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; He got the fullness of the Godhead
[1:54:13] badly.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; So, it's easy for Jesus to endure the
[1:54:16] cross.
[1:54:21] As a matter of fact, they even help him
[1:54:23] bear the cross
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; by sermon of
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; he was even unable to bear his own
[1:54:30] cross.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; So it's normal for you to go sometime
[1:54:36] and you feel overwhelmed. It's normal.
[1:54:40] [Applause]
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; The problem is the season give me hope.
[1:54:45] I know this cross have an end.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; I know the devil will go only that far.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; When it's finished, God comes in
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; because David say he will not let his
[1:54:57] holy one
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; see corruption. When Jesus heard that,
[1:55:02] he said no problem. Satan, take me where
[1:55:05] you want it.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; Take me where you want. I know this is
[1:55:09] just for a season. But after season in
[1:55:13] the resurrection morning, he came out.
[1:55:16] He said, "All power in heaven and earth
[1:55:20] are given unto me."
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; What gives him strength? The result.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; There was another season.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; Jesus was going down through the prison.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; Through hell and from hell. He was
[1:55:36] climbing higher than even the heaven
[1:55:38] itself.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; And the Bible say for the joy
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; that was set before him.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; When he look at you
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; when he look at spoken word
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; and he saw you saying amen.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; Jesus say Satan bring it on
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; because I see a church in Gastonia on
[1:56:01] fire under the message of Yahweh. people
[1:56:05] that will worship me in the beauty of
[1:56:07] holiness. Hallelujah. When I see them, I
[1:56:11] don't care.
[1:56:13] [Applause]
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; Season bring you hope.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; Season bring you strength.
[1:56:24] [Applause]
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; The Bible say, "For the joy that was set
[1:56:29] where?"
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; He did what?
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; Endured the cross.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; Despising what? the shame.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; So no matter what shame, they even took
[1:56:36] his clothes off
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; and put him over there naked.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; Jesus despised that.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he's focusing on something.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; He's focusing on the book of redemption.
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; He said once I cross this,
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; I will take the book of redemption and
[1:56:52] send it back to Adam.
[1:56:55] [Music]
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; Because he knew John will cry.
[1:57:04] My heart is
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; who is worthy.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; He say I don't want when brother John
[1:57:08] cry and there is no redeemer. I must be
[1:57:12] there for him.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; When he said who is worthy I am worthy.
[1:57:17] I am the lion of the tribe of Judah. I
[1:57:19] have prevailed.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; No matter what you going through
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; the season give you hope.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's telling you not. It's not
[1:57:34] going to be eternal.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; It is temporal.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; For the joy that was set before him, he
[1:57:42] did what?
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; Endured the cross.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; And did what?
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; Despising the shame.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; And he set after the season
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; down where?
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; At the right hand of the throne of God.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; Now after that
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; today, every knee
[1:57:56] bow,
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; every throne,
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; every knee, every tongue shall do what?
[1:58:02] When Jesus look at that
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; above principalities and stuff,
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; he endured the cross.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; When they struck him, he's quiet saying,
[1:58:10] "Don't worry, Satan. Keep moving.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; Keep moving. Keep moving. Sooner, I'm
[1:58:15] going to see Abraham and everybody."
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; The season of trial brought him to
[1:58:20] paradise.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Season brings hope.
[1:58:29] Knowing that whatever you going through
[1:58:31] is only temporal.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; There is something better that is coming
[1:58:35] up.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; If I'm going through a valley, there
[1:58:38] must be a mountain.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says this. He says that
[1:58:46] father
[1:58:47] Jesus speaking. He says, "Father, the
[1:58:50] what?
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; The time has come.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; Now there is a season for what?
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; Everything."
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Yes,
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; you saw how
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; a certain seed
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; and you reap how
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; in a certain

[1:59:02] Psalm 126 the Bible say that they that
[1:59:06] saw how
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; in tears
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; you will reap how
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; in joy.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; So what is keeping the sew work moving
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; it is the joy that is coming up there
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; and the Bible say the joy of the Lord is
[1:59:18] your strength.
[1:59:22] So when I'm calling, it's not a problem.
[1:59:25] It is what is coming up after the call.
[1:59:28] [Applause]
[1:59:32] Glory, glory, glory, glory, glory,
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; go at night and go see sister Pam when
[1:59:38] she's working
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; on the decoration.

[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; She's right there.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; She even fell.

[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. But in the morning on Saturday
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; when we came when we entered that place
[1:59:55] when we begin to look at the decoration
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; for the joy of the decoration
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; she said pam do you know what the
[2:00:02] manager of the hotel told me he said
[2:00:05] whatever she did there were people that
[2:00:07] stood there and that requested her
[2:00:10] number.
[2:00:12] Amen.
[2:00:18] [Applause]
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; All the toys and everything, there was
[2:00:22] something ahead. Amen.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; He was beyond brother Kenny.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; He was opening a door for something
[2:00:29] else.
[2:00:32] [Applause]
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together? The who who goes in
[2:00:42] sowing how?
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; In tears
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; shall reap how
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; in joy.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; He that goes forth in what?
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; Weeping
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; bearing water
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; precious seed.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; So you bear precious uh um I mean seed
[2:00:53] laughing
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; doing what?
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; Weeping shall deathless. In other words,
[2:00:58] this is a guarantee.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; In other words, there is a season to
[2:01:05] cry.
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; There is a season to weep. But if I'm
[2:01:10] weeping right now,
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; Satan, let me give you an announcement.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; There is a season of joy.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; That is coming ahead.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; Because joy comes in the morning.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; Weeping may stay in the night, wait in
[2:01:30] the morning.
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; When the sun is up, joy is coming.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; The Bible say deathless he come again.
[2:01:38] How
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; with rejoicing
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; bringing water
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; she with him
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; season
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; brings you hope
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; I'm coughing
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; Satan
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; only maybe two weeks you have
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; yeah only two weeks
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to die
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; because the root the devil doesn't get
[2:02:05] in the root
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; that's why when God was opening the door
[2:02:08] for Job's trial.
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; He told the devil, don't touch his life
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; because the life goes in the root.
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; You don't touch the root.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; In other words, go ahead. It's only two
[2:02:18] weeks.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; Sometime you take the baby to the
[2:02:23] hospital and the doctor say keep giving
[2:02:25] him Tylenol and juice.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; So Satan all you need to leave this baby
[2:02:33] is juice,
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; orange juice.
[2:02:36] [Applause]
[2:02:37] [Laughter]
[2:02:40] Because the virus has its course.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; When it's finished, they all die.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; Season bring you hope.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Brother Brandham says
[2:02:55] this. He say, "Our heavenly father, we
[2:02:57] come to thee on the Sabbath day raining
[2:03:00] where
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; on the outside
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; we might call it what?
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; Gloom. A gloomy, a hazy, rainy weather.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; But how could the farmer put in his
[2:03:10] crop?
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; What you call a bad weather?
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; The farmer is on jubilee.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; Rejoicing. Amen.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; How could the farmer put his crop if we
[2:03:24] didn't have much moisture this spring?
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; So what you call gloomy,
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; it's a blessing.
[2:03:33] Amen.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say there be no food
[2:03:38] waste ground will be how
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; dry
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; people will be waterish.
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; We realize that this is like experience
[2:03:46] of water.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; A Christian.
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; Sometime we have to go through terrible
[2:03:51] chastisement.
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; Chastisement of who?
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; The Lord.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; Many times to do what?
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; Correct us.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; That we shall be what?
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; Fruit bearing Christians. Because we are
[2:04:02] trees
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; and the tree need to be pruned.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; But the purpose of prrooming is not to
[2:04:09] kill the tree.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; Is to bring more fruit.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; He say sometime
[2:04:19] has to do what?
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; Prune and doing what?
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; Cut off.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; And do what?
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; Take away
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; and take out take out of what?
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; Our hands. We think sometime oh God what
[2:04:30] are you doing to us but he knows what
[2:04:32] he's doing.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we pray father that today you
[2:04:36] shall do what
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; fruit every one of us
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; from the midst to who?
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; The greatest
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; come out the who?
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; The pastor.
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; Let me skip that one.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; I read only brother Brham. Ah because
[2:04:54] you're going to put yourself like the
[2:04:55] greatest. Brother Brham say that from
[2:04:58] the list to who?
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; The greatest
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; the greatest who?
[2:05:02] He says, "God, we pray that you shall do
[2:05:05] what?
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; Fruit every one of us.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; Take away all that is unlike you,
[2:05:10] Father. Take away the things that is
[2:05:12] doing what?
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; Hindering us
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; from being what?"
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; Fruit bearing Christians.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; So your chastisement is a blessing.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; With your own brother, you say, "Brother
[2:05:26] Brham, I'm a Christian. I got a sickness
[2:05:29] now. I wonder why he come.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; God may be purging you.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Give you what?
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; Some trials.
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; Make you jo
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; a little closer to him. Pray a while.
[2:05:43] Then do what?
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; Heal you.
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; That you can have what?
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; A testimony.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; Christ heal you. You say, "Well, I heard
[2:05:51] he heal." I The husband is the partaker
[2:05:53] of the fruit. Then see, I thought he was
[2:05:56] awful hard when I was getting mine. And
[2:05:59] if he had just been me, I would have
[2:06:01] what?
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; Failed.
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham say if he was just
[2:06:04] depending on him with your own brother.
[2:06:06] Brother Brandham himself would have
[2:06:08] failed the test.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham said, but something
[2:06:11] is where
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; in me.
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; Not me keeping it.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; It's what?
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; The question is whether it shall hold
[2:06:19] out or not. It is whether he held out or
[2:06:22] not.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; Whether I shall hold out or not. It's
[2:06:26] whether he God held out or not. And if
[2:06:30] he held out then I'm sure to be where
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; the question is not whether I can do it
[2:06:37] or not.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; It's whether he did it
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; or not.
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; I believe he did it and that
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; settles it.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham continue. He said
[2:06:48] Job was taking his children through
[2:06:51] every the only provided approach there
[2:06:53] was the burnt offering. And now here is
[2:06:57] a little thing I want you to notice.
[2:06:59] After all the turmoil
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; and everything was over. And then God
[2:07:05] has taken all his sheep and his cattle
[2:07:08] and his horses and things. Then at the
[2:07:11] end of his chastisement
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; all what?
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; Purging.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; God did what?
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; Double it.
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; If he had 10,000 cattle, he gave him
[2:07:22] what?
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; 20,000 cattle.
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; See? Oh, isn't that wonderful?
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; God purge job
[2:07:31] [Applause]
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; not punish
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; purge job
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; for the purpose to do what?
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; Bless him.
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; So if I'm going through the purging,
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; what is coming up?
[2:07:48] [Applause]
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham said in the end then after
[2:07:58] Job had done everything laid in the way.
[2:08:01] This provided ways of approaches to God
[2:08:04] for all his children. He approached for
[2:08:06] his children praying on their behalf. If
[2:08:08] you ever notice at the end of the road,
[2:08:12] Job did what?
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; Restored back double.
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; God gave him double
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; what he had. He did what?
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; Purged him.
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; And did what?
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; Restore to him. So the purging have a
[2:08:23] purpose.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; The se there is a season for purging.
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; And there is a season for blessing.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; If I'm going through purging,
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; There is a blessing coming up.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?

[2:11:47] belt.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; If you fool, you tell me.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; Me, I'm fine. I'm like a fish in the
[2:11:55] water now.
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; So, I can jump and come up. I'm fine.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. My battery was more than 8 hours
[2:12:02] charge.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; So, I'm good.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; The problem is not me. The problem is
[2:12:06] you.
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:12:12] Uh we still have time my friend.
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; The season the pastor is here every
[2:12:20] Sunday.
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; So enjoy the season
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; before the pastor get a vacation.
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; Ah enjoy the season.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; Okay. Last Sunday since we stretch up a
[2:12:37] little bit. Last Sunday we talked about
[2:12:40] someone and Mark. We found out that a
[2:12:43] tree bear fruit when
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; in season
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; in it season.
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; But for some reason a question mark
[2:12:49] Jesus went out of season.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:54] [Laughter]
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; When he went out of season, he went to
[2:12:59] find fruit
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; and there was no fruit. Instead of
[2:13:03] freeing the tree, he cursed the tree.
[2:13:06] And the Bible say it was not time for
[2:13:08] the fig yet. And brother Brandham
[2:13:10] emphasized that the word time was not
[2:13:13] really time but it was not the season
[2:13:15] yet.
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; And we draw from there a conclusion last
[2:13:21] Sunday that God is both in season
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; and out of season.
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; In other words, God expect fruit to be
[2:13:31] all the time.
[2:13:33] [Applause]
[2:13:35] I hope we are together.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; because when you go to the book of
[2:13:42] revelation
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; and the last book of revelation,
[2:13:46] &gt;&gt; the tree of life is there.
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; The Bible say the tree of life
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; bear fruit every month.
[2:13:53] [Applause]
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; You don't know that scripture. Amen.
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; In other words, every month you find the
[2:14:00] fruit on the tree of life.
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; And Jesus have a right to go every
[2:14:05] month.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:14:08] [Music]
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; are we together?
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; Now we begin to get we are now alert.
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; Because when it's time for the fruit,
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; yes,
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; we are awake.
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; If Jesus come, the fruit are here. If
[2:14:26] Jesus come the fruit are here but we
[2:14:28] find Jesus enter
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; when it's not time for the fruit.
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; Now we are nervous
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; that God is every time
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; even when fruit are not there.
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean he's not there.
[2:14:47] [Music]
[2:14:49] [Applause]
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; I don't know. Let me let me recalibrate
[2:14:53] this.
[2:14:55] We would expect
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; in when it's time for fruit,
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; we expect Jesus to come.
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; Everybody will say, "Yes, he was hungry
[2:15:05] and there was a fruit tree over there."
[2:15:07] So, guess what? He need to go and get
[2:15:08] the fruit because it's time of the
[2:15:10] fruit. But Jesus went when he was not
[2:15:12] time of the fruit.
[2:15:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; So, whoever got used
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; to Jesus being present when fruits are
[2:15:22] there,
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. came up with a conclusion in his
[2:15:26] own life that God only is there when
[2:15:29] there is fruit.
[2:15:31] [Music]
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; but now we find out that even if there
[2:15:40] is no time for fruit, God is there.
[2:15:44] [Music]
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; Here it's natural.
[2:15:53] Yes sir. Yes sir.
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; Over here it's supernatural
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; because this one required the third
[2:16:02] pool.
[2:16:04] [Applause]
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:16:09] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; If you walking through a forest,
[2:16:15] &gt;&gt; you expect to see a tree.
[2:16:17] &gt;&gt; You expect to see food.
[2:16:19] &gt;&gt; It's normal. But if you walking in the
[2:16:21] wilderness,
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; it takes the supernatural
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; to bring the fruit there.
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; But God is not only the God of the
[2:16:30] forest.
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; He's also the God of the wilderness.
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; He's God a home.
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; He's God a beautiful house.
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; He's God in a prison.
[2:16:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. We begin to
[2:16:50] understand that God is in season
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; and out of season.
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; But the way we were geared, me and you,
[2:16:58] when we grow up, we know that God comes
[2:17:00] only in season.
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; And in season, everybody get prepared.
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; Because it's a season. But what about if
[2:17:11] it's not a season?
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; What do you do? And the wisdom of
[2:17:16] Issachar
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; discerned the season
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; and he tells you what to do. Now let's
[2:17:22] go to Jeremiah 29 as we getting our
[2:17:25] surgery.
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; Jeremiah 29. If you there, you can say
[2:17:40] amen. Amen.
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; Because somebody in season, he's ready
[2:17:47] for work.
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; If it's not a season, what should I do?
[2:17:52] Nothing. Chill out.
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; But Christ is there.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; So if it's not a season, be careful.
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; If you're not a home,
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; just the fact that you're not a home,
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; be careful. The presence of the Lord is
[2:18:09] there. Amen.
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; Even though you're not at home, you in
[2:18:13] prison, the presence of the Lord is
[2:18:15] there.
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; What should I do in prison? What should
[2:18:19] I do in pro house? If you there, you can
[2:18:21] say amen.
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:23] &gt;&gt; Jeremiah 29 verse1. Let's go through the
[2:18:25] surgery.
[2:18:27] &gt;&gt; Now, these are the words of the letter
[2:18:30] that Jeremiah the prophet sent to
[2:18:32] Jerusalem to the residue or the rest of
[2:18:36] what?
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; Elders.
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; Continue my friend. He sent a letter to
[2:18:40] who?
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; To the elders. Which
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; To the elders? Continue.
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; Which were carried away captives.
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. And what?
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; And to the priests.
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; And to the priests. And who else?
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; And to the prophets.
[2:18:50] &gt;&gt; And who else?
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; And to all the people whom
[2:18:53] Nebuchadnezzar
[2:18:54] had carried away captive.
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; And all the people who Nebuchadnezzar
[2:18:59] did what?
[2:19:00] &gt;&gt; Had carried away captive.
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; Now I want you to understand that all
[2:19:05] these people are captive.
[2:19:10] Amen.
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; They were taken like prisoners.
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; Follow me my friend.
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; And they were captive from Israel.
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; To Babylon.
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; They move from home. These captive are
[2:19:24] in Babylon.
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; They are in a gentile land.
[2:19:31] &gt;&gt; They are not home.
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; We clear my friend. Amen.
[2:19:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:38] &gt;&gt; What is a condition of a captive?
[2:19:44] &gt;&gt; Somebody that they took from home like
[2:19:46] Joseph,
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; they took him from his comfort zone,
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; from his neighborhood
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; where he had a job and everything was
[2:19:54] going fine. War came broke destroy
[2:19:57] everything. They take him to another
[2:19:59] place.
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; so another season open up.
[2:20:05] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Amen.
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; I'm going I'm going clearly
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; where Israel become in the season of
[2:20:13] captivity.
[2:20:15] [Music]

[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; Father, help your church.
[2:20:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:20:25] friend.
[2:20:26] And those that were taken in captive
[2:20:29] were not only the people,

[2:20:35] &gt;&gt; the prophet captive, all the people
[2:20:38] captive,

[2:21:34] captive.
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.

[2:23:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; Whom I have caused to be what?
[2:23:11] &gt;&gt; Carried away from what?
[2:23:12] &gt;&gt; Jerusalem.
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; To who? To be what?
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; Into Babylon.
[2:23:16] So these people move from Jerusalem
[2:23:19] &gt;&gt; to Babylon.
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; And when the word of the Lord is coming,
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; the first thing is that, oh, it's our
[2:23:26] season to return back to Jerusalem.
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; We clear
[2:23:31] &gt;&gt; verse five. Uh verse five, he says, "Do
[2:23:35] what?
[2:23:36] &gt;&gt; Build ye houses."
[2:23:38] &gt;&gt; Stop.
[2:23:39] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; Huh? Church, please help me. If not, I
[2:23:44] stop here. We see you next Sunday.
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; Do what?
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; Build ye houses.
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; Build houses where?
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; In Babylon.
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; Babylon.
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; Who saying that?
[2:23:53] &gt;&gt; God.
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; The Lord.
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; Built house where?
[2:24:01] &gt;&gt; Babylon.
[2:24:01] &gt;&gt; Israel. In other words, when Israel went
[2:24:04] to captivity,
[2:24:06] &gt;&gt; Israel stood there.
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; They say, "H, build a house." No.
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; Uh, let's put tent tent. And because
[2:24:14] sooner it's going to be easy to to rent
[2:24:17] a U-Haul
[2:24:20] &gt;&gt; and to put everything to go because if
[2:24:23] you get a mortgage right here
[2:24:25] &gt;&gt; uh you will leave the mortgage to the
[2:24:27] Babylonian.
[2:24:28] &gt;&gt; So Israel begin to live in a state of
[2:24:34] &gt;&gt; in a in a uncertainty
[2:24:38] &gt;&gt; because they're getting ready to go. Now
[2:24:41] the word of the Lord come
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; instead of God telling them prepare to
[2:24:45] go back God say hey where you are
[2:24:49] &gt;&gt; build houses
[2:24:50] &gt;&gt; built a house there
[2:24:52] [Applause]
[2:24:55] &gt;&gt; a house where in Babylon
[2:24:58] [Music]
[2:25:01] &gt;&gt; who said that the major prophet
[2:25:05] &gt;&gt; that say the Lord
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; why is God telling Israel to built a
[2:25:11] house. Follow me, my friend. I told you
[2:25:13] it's a major surgery
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; for you to understand this very well.
[2:25:17] Job to verse 8 and I will come back to
[2:25:19] verse 5.
[2:25:20] &gt;&gt; Job to verse eight.
[2:25:22] &gt;&gt; Let's go, my friend. If you dare, you
[2:25:24] can say amen.
[2:25:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:25] &gt;&gt; For what?
[2:25:26] &gt;&gt; For thus sayith the Lord of hosts.
[2:25:28] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. The God of what?
[2:25:29] &gt;&gt; Israel.
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; The Lord of hosts instead of the Lord of
[2:25:32] hosts. The Lord the Lord of hosts means
[2:25:34] the eternal of the Lord of the army.
[2:25:37] Yes.
[2:25:39] &gt;&gt; So when the Lord of the arm is coming
[2:25:41] for the people into captivity, he will
[2:25:44] rescue them.
[2:25:45] &gt;&gt; But the God with an army is saying build
[2:25:48] a house.
[2:25:50] &gt;&gt; Why? Let's let's let's follow this
[2:25:52] thought. Verse eight. For thus sayith
[2:25:55] the Lord, the Lord of hosts, the God of
[2:25:57] what?
[2:25:58] &gt;&gt; Israel.
[2:25:59] &gt;&gt; Let not your prophet
[2:26:01] &gt;&gt; and your what?
[2:26:03] &gt;&gt; That be in the midst of you.
[2:26:07] do what? Deceive you.
[2:26:10] &gt;&gt; So the prophet that were here, follow me
[2:26:13] my friend,
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; were giving Israel
[2:26:17] a different instruction.
[2:26:21] [Music]
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together.
[2:26:26] &gt;&gt; God already prepared a time
[2:26:30] &gt;&gt; for captivity. There was a season for
[2:26:33] captivity.
[2:26:35] &gt;&gt; When Israel entered the season, Israel
[2:26:39] did not know what to do
[2:26:41] &gt;&gt; in the season
[2:26:42] &gt;&gt; because they had taken captive.
[2:26:44] &gt;&gt; So what do we do in the midst of this
[2:26:46] place right here?
[2:26:48] &gt;&gt; What do we do? And the prophet came
[2:26:52] &gt;&gt; that save the Lord.
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; We will return to Israel.
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; Israel say, "Oh, praise the Lord."
[2:26:58] Hallelujah. So, let's go to the public
[2:27:01] storage.
[2:27:04] I'm preaching in the present time. Let's
[2:27:07] rent a public storage and keep all our
[2:27:10] belongings there because in 2 years we
[2:27:13] going to in 3 years we going to go home.
[2:27:19] &gt;&gt; Then Jeremiah said no
[2:27:22] &gt;&gt; build houses.
[2:27:26] Ah
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; father help your church
[2:27:31] &gt;&gt; and God say hey there are prophet in the
[2:27:34] midst of you
[2:27:35] &gt;&gt; that are prophesying
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; let's continue my friend
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; that is that are in the midst of you
[2:27:41] they are doing what
[2:27:43] &gt;&gt; they deceive you verse eight neither I
[2:27:47] can do what
[2:27:48] &gt;&gt; your dreams
[2:27:49] &gt;&gt; which you what
[2:27:50] &gt;&gt; cause to be dreamed
[2:27:52] &gt;&gt; let's go slowly
[2:27:54] &gt;&gt; dream not and
[2:27:58] Neither heart can do what
[2:27:59] &gt;&gt; your dreams.
[2:28:01] &gt;&gt; Your dreams which who cause to be dream
[2:28:03] &gt;&gt; you.
[2:28:05] &gt;&gt; So the people
[2:28:06] &gt;&gt; begin to put pressure
[2:28:09] right
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; follow me
[2:28:12] &gt;&gt; please. Okay put your seat belts back
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; because it's a bumpy road. The people
[2:28:18] begin to put pressure on those who have
[2:28:22] the gift
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; to give them messages.
[2:28:27] [Applause]
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; In other words, I don't like this place.
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; This is not home. I'm captive in this
[2:28:38] place.
[2:28:39] &gt;&gt; I'm not comfortable. There is no
[2:28:41] McDonald here.
[2:28:43] &gt;&gt; There is no Chick-fil-A here. Please,
[2:28:46] brother Tony, you are gifted. Can you
[2:28:48] pray the Lord to tell me what really is
[2:28:50] going on in my life?
[2:28:54] &gt;&gt; And brother Tony goes to prayer and he
[2:28:56] come up. He said, "The Lord will remove
[2:28:58] you in two days. It's not going to
[2:29:00] happen."
[2:29:04] &gt;&gt; The people begin to put pressure
[2:29:07] &gt;&gt; to have dream according to the plan but
[2:29:11] not according to the season of God.
[2:29:16] Oh, glory to God.
[2:29:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:29:19] &gt;&gt; Are we together? That's why we need to
[2:29:22] watch gifts.
[2:29:24] [Music]
[2:29:27] &gt;&gt; Gifts are corrected by the word.
[2:29:31] &gt;&gt; You must have to keep the word on top of
[2:29:34] everything.
[2:29:40] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me good.
[2:29:42] Amen.
[2:29:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:44] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[2:29:45] &gt;&gt; These are my daughter.
[2:29:47] &gt;&gt; These are my daughter. So remove
[2:29:49] everything.
[2:29:51] &gt;&gt; I'm a single man. The sister look good.
[2:29:55] Praise the Lord. When she pass when she
[2:29:58] pass when she pass
[2:30:02] that sister and the sister also
[2:30:06] this is your season. The brother is
[2:30:10] Yeah. your season is coming up.
[2:30:14] And the brother goes home and he sit
[2:30:16] sister so and so. He got in his WhatsApp
[2:30:20] in her WhatsApp watching her podos that
[2:30:23] the sister turn around and the sister is
[2:30:26] watching
[2:30:27] [Laughter]
[2:30:30] and the brother are watching and the
[2:30:31] brother the wife the brother are saying
[2:30:33] wow
[2:30:36] &gt;&gt; and the brother goes to sleep
[2:30:40] &gt;&gt; and he dream sister so and so
[2:30:44] &gt;&gt; is telling him you my husband of course
[2:30:46] the dream must
[2:30:49] You already love her.
[2:30:54] &gt;&gt; You are thinking about her all the time.
[2:30:57] Guess what? The dream will come. But is
[2:31:00] it God's dream?
[2:31:03] [Applause]
[2:31:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Oh Lord,
[2:31:12] I want a confirmation. When I go, if she
[2:31:15] smile, that's her. God bless you sister.
[2:31:18] And the sister naturally,
[2:31:20] she always smile. Sister Divine always
[2:31:23] smile. So what is your problem? How can
[2:31:26] a smile be a confirmation?
[2:31:30] [Applause]
[2:31:32] &gt;&gt; Are we together? So the people begin to
[2:31:35] put pressure on the gift to receive
[2:31:38] messages
[2:31:39] &gt;&gt; to change them from the season.
[2:31:44] &gt;&gt; Are we together? church. Are we
[2:31:47] together?
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this. He says, "I
[2:31:51] realize I'm talking to what?"
[2:31:53] &gt;&gt; 99% of Pentecostals.
[2:31:56] &gt;&gt; 99% of what?
[2:31:58] &gt;&gt; Pentecostal.
[2:31:59] &gt;&gt; Why is brother saying this?
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; He says, "But men many times a what?
[2:32:05] &gt;&gt; A man.
[2:32:06] &gt;&gt; God deal with what?
[2:32:09] &gt;&gt; With with them. Give them a what?
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; A gift.
[2:32:11] &gt;&gt; And people will squeeze in on those
[2:32:13] people. Especially
[2:32:16] Pentecostal.
[2:32:18] &gt;&gt; Tell me what the Lord say about me.
[2:32:20] &gt;&gt; Tell me what the Lord say about me.
[2:32:24] &gt;&gt; The word does the word say don't do it.
[2:32:26] &gt;&gt; And you go back to the can you ask the
[2:32:28] Lord's will? The word already say don't
[2:32:30] do it. How can we ask the Lord's will?
[2:32:34] [Music]
[2:32:36] &gt;&gt; The Lord said don't don't lie. And you
[2:32:39] go and you say please Lord ask the Lord
[2:32:41] should I lie or not?
[2:32:45] He says, "And the people will squeeze in
[2:32:48] in those what
[2:32:49] &gt;&gt; people
[2:32:50] &gt;&gt; if they are not perfectly called
[2:32:53] &gt;&gt; and say not called perfectly called
[2:32:56] &gt;&gt; and send of what
[2:32:58] &gt;&gt; of God.
[2:32:59] &gt;&gt; He shall cause the man
[2:33:01] &gt;&gt; or woman to say something that is not
[2:33:05] his will.
[2:33:06] &gt;&gt; Because the people do do what?
[2:33:08] &gt;&gt; Constrains them to do it.
[2:33:10] &gt;&gt; The people are putting pressure on you.
[2:33:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. I can't stand the test too long.
[2:33:16] &gt;&gt; So come up with something for me.
[2:33:18] &gt;&gt; He says how I had to catch our own
[2:33:21] leader pastor here
[2:33:23] &gt;&gt; on it. I
[2:33:26] &gt;&gt; out here in the wood one morning about
[2:33:28] what?
[2:33:29] &gt;&gt; 3:00 in the morning.
[2:33:30] &gt;&gt; The Lord told him, "Go tell brother
[2:33:32] Neville,
[2:33:33] &gt;&gt; I come to you." Didn't I, brother
[2:33:35] Neville?
[2:33:37] &gt;&gt; If he was I, I quit the church the same
[2:33:39] day.
[2:33:39] &gt;&gt; He called me from the pulpit.
[2:33:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Didn't I, brother
[2:33:43] Neville, everybody, brother Neville,
[2:33:46] prophesy over me. Tell me this or that."
[2:33:48] See, you have him saying things that
[2:33:52] them that will not come to what?
[2:33:54] &gt;&gt; To pass.
[2:33:55] &gt;&gt; They that do what?
[2:33:56] &gt;&gt; Wait.
[2:33:57] &gt;&gt; To find out what the Lord
[2:34:00] &gt;&gt; to do,
[2:34:04] &gt;&gt; too much pressure.
[2:34:06] &gt;&gt; Let's call so and so over there. He has
[2:34:08] a gift. And sister, remember me in
[2:34:11] prayer. I'm going through something. I
[2:34:13] need to know what the will of the Lord.
[2:34:15] You already in love with the boy.
[2:34:21] &gt;&gt; If they say it's not the Lord will, will
[2:34:23] you stop?
[2:34:27] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:34:29] &gt;&gt; There is.
[2:34:32] &gt;&gt; There is your what?
[2:34:33] &gt;&gt; Five months.
[2:34:34] &gt;&gt; It's got to be what?
[2:34:36] &gt;&gt; That way.
[2:34:36] &gt;&gt; What
[2:34:37] &gt;&gt; is time? what
[2:34:38] &gt;&gt; the season
[2:34:39] &gt;&gt; when he said he will be and the man that
[2:34:42] he chose and he must come to the what?
[2:34:44] &gt;&gt; Prophet.
[2:34:45] &gt;&gt; He must be in season.
[2:34:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:49] &gt;&gt; But what did Israel do? Israel went and
[2:34:52] put pressure.
[2:34:53] &gt;&gt; Prophesy for us.
[2:34:55] &gt;&gt; We don't like this place.
[2:34:56] &gt;&gt; This is a captivity right here. I'm not
[2:34:59] free. And the prophet begin to say in
[2:35:02] two years you out. In two years, a
[2:35:05] Israel say in two years we going to
[2:35:08] homeschool our children.
[2:35:11] &gt;&gt; They won't go to their school over
[2:35:13] there. You know what? We're not going to
[2:35:15] work. We will be living on our crop. We
[2:35:17] don't want to mingle with those
[2:35:18] unbeliever over here. You stay here.
[2:35:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:23] &gt;&gt; And God is talking now. Jump to verse 9.
[2:35:26] For they prophesy falsely to you
[2:35:30] &gt;&gt; in my name.
[2:35:32] So when somebody saying that save the
[2:35:34] Lord, don't be intimidating.
[2:35:36] &gt;&gt; Don't be intimidating.
[2:35:38] &gt;&gt; Watch what they're saying by the word.
[2:35:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:43] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you understand me.
[2:35:45] &gt;&gt; If you come to me, you say, "Brother
[2:35:48] Steven,
[2:35:50] &gt;&gt; I already pick up Sister Divine on this
[2:35:52] side. So let me go on this side." So to
[2:35:54] be fair, I'm a pastor. Okay. If if
[2:35:57] somebody come and say sister Charlene,
[2:35:59] &gt;&gt; they say brother Stephen uh the Lord
[2:36:02] spoke to me about sister Charlene this
[2:36:03] this this you know the first thing I
[2:36:05] have to do.
[2:36:06] &gt;&gt; Number one I listen to your message.
[2:36:08] &gt;&gt; Number two I will check your
[2:36:10] relationship with sister Charlie.
[2:36:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you already got problem with
[2:36:18] sister Charlie and you hate each other
[2:36:20] for a long time, your message is
[2:36:23] questionable
[2:36:25] &gt;&gt; because I don't know if it's the Lord or
[2:36:28] if or if the abundance of your hatred.
[2:36:36] [Applause]
[2:36:41] [Music]
[2:36:43] I'm dealing with this thing, my friend.
[2:36:45] I'm dealing with this thing, my friend.
[2:36:46] So, let me layer that here.
[2:36:51] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:36:52] &gt;&gt; If you already hate Sister Lorel,
[2:36:55] &gt;&gt; I put your message in question because I
[2:36:58] don't know whether it's God or it's your
[2:37:00] hatred.
[2:37:05] &gt;&gt; You already hate the sister
[2:37:07] &gt;&gt; and you come back, the Lord say that
[2:37:09] sister will die. You already hate her.
[2:37:15] I don't know where that is coming from,
[2:37:18] but I have to to maneuver with my gun
[2:37:21] the correct way.
[2:37:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:37:25] &gt;&gt; God say here he says they are
[2:37:28] prophesying what
[2:37:30] &gt;&gt; a lie. I have not sent them say the
[2:37:33] Lord. Watch now verse 10. For thus say
[2:37:36] the Lord that after what? 70 years.
[2:37:39] &gt;&gt; There is already a mark time.
[2:37:43] &gt;&gt; You going to stay there 70 years.
[2:37:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:48] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the law say if you overuse
[2:37:51] the land
[2:37:53] &gt;&gt; and you miss it Sabbath
[2:37:55] &gt;&gt; based on the law, the foundation of the
[2:37:57] law, God must restore 70 years to the
[2:38:01] land to take a peace. So anyone who will
[2:38:04] come with a prophecy
[2:38:06] &gt;&gt; contrary to 70 years is going against
[2:38:09] the word.
[2:38:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:12] &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together.
[2:38:13] &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together.
[2:38:15] &gt;&gt; God say how long Israel should stay
[2:38:18] there?
[2:38:19] &gt;&gt; 70 years.
[2:38:22] &gt;&gt; 70 years.
[2:38:24] &gt;&gt; Watch my friend.
[2:38:26] Depending.
[2:38:28] Israel was 70. Yours might be two. Yours
[2:38:31] might be three. Somebody might be five,
[2:38:33] somebody might be six month.
[2:38:35] &gt;&gt; The problem is you got to know what to
[2:38:37] do.
[2:38:39] &gt;&gt; Verse uh 10. For that say the Lord that
[2:38:42] after what?
[2:38:43] &gt;&gt; 70 years
[2:38:44] &gt;&gt; shall be uh be what?
[2:38:45] &gt;&gt; Accomplished
[2:38:46] &gt;&gt; where
[2:38:46] &gt;&gt; at Babylon.
[2:38:47] &gt;&gt; And Babylon I will do what?
[2:38:50] &gt;&gt; I will visit you.
[2:38:51] &gt;&gt; Who took them to Babylon?
[2:38:53] &gt;&gt; God.
[2:38:53] &gt;&gt; Who will come to visit you?
[2:38:55] &gt;&gt; God.
[2:38:55] &gt;&gt; So who will move you from one step to
[2:38:58] another?

[2:39:12] &gt;&gt; If you live a 50 years,
[2:39:15] &gt;&gt; you will go without God.
[2:39:18] &gt;&gt; Because remember where you move is where
[2:39:20] God is.
[2:39:22] [Applause]
[2:39:27] &gt;&gt; If you were home, you move in puller
[2:39:29] house. Where is God? Hallelujah.
[2:39:31] &gt;&gt; If you move from Portifer to the prison,
[2:39:33] where is God?
[2:39:35] &gt;&gt; If you move from the prison to Pharaoh
[2:39:36] house, where is God?
[2:39:38] &gt;&gt; If you move from Israel to Babylon,
[2:39:40] where did God go?
[2:39:41] &gt;&gt; Babylon.
[2:39:42] &gt;&gt; Why is God telling you built in Babylon?
[2:39:44] So where is God?
[2:39:50] [Applause]

[2:39:56] second. Give me one second. I need to

[2:40:28] &gt;&gt; Nebuchadnezzar.
[2:40:30] &gt;&gt; God is saying, I give all the land to
[2:40:32] Nabuh
[2:40:33] unto the into the hand of who?
[2:40:35] &gt;&gt; Nebuchadnezzar.
[2:40:36] &gt;&gt; The king of what?
[2:40:37] &gt;&gt; Babylon.
[2:40:38] &gt;&gt; Who?
[2:40:38] &gt;&gt; My servant.
[2:40:39] &gt;&gt; Nebuchadnezzar is the servant of who?
[2:40:43] [Music]
[2:40:45] &gt;&gt; Please answer me. Nebuchadnezzar is the
[2:40:47] the servant of who?
[2:40:48] &gt;&gt; God.
[2:40:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. So Pifer was working
[2:40:57] for who?
[2:40:58] &gt;&gt; The Lord.
[2:40:58] &gt;&gt; The Lord.
[2:41:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:41:01] &gt;&gt; Pifer was working for who?
[2:41:04] &gt;&gt; Let's go back where we were, my friend.
[2:41:06] &gt;&gt; We on 29, my friend.
[2:41:08] &gt;&gt; We there.
[2:41:10] &gt;&gt; We there.
[2:41:11] &gt;&gt; He said 70 years must be fulfilled,
[2:41:14] accomplished at Babylon. And I will do
[2:41:16] what?
[2:41:17] &gt;&gt; Visit you.
[2:41:18] &gt;&gt; I will visit you and do what?
[2:41:20] &gt;&gt; Perform my good word. my good word
[2:41:23] toward you in causing you to do what?
[2:41:26] &gt;&gt; Return to this.
[2:41:27] &gt;&gt; So who's going to bring Israel back?
[2:41:29] &gt;&gt; The Lord.
[2:41:31] &gt;&gt; In other word, the one who initiate the
[2:41:35] captivity
[2:41:37] &gt;&gt; is God.
[2:41:38] &gt;&gt; And when he's initiating the trial,
[2:41:41] &gt;&gt; he's also preparing the way out of that
[2:41:45] trial.
[2:41:49] &gt;&gt; I don't know if we're getting that. I'm
[2:41:51] the one taking you to Babylon.
[2:41:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:54] &gt;&gt; Stay there.
[2:41:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:41:58] &gt;&gt; Because the one that took you there is
[2:42:00] my servant
[2:42:01] &gt;&gt; even though he's a hidden.
[2:42:04] &gt;&gt; He's working for me.
[2:42:07] &gt;&gt; In other words, I have everything under
[2:42:10] control in Babylon.
[2:42:15] &gt;&gt; I know it's going to shock you.
[2:42:17] &gt;&gt; I know it's going to shock you. Amen.
[2:42:20] &gt;&gt; You going to Babylon, the king there is
[2:42:23] my servant.
[2:42:24] &gt;&gt; I am the one who gave him all the land.
[2:42:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:42:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir.
[2:42:29] &gt;&gt; And I have a scripture there. I'm trying
[2:42:30] to save time. God told the king of
[2:42:33] Israel, if you don't put your neck under
[2:42:35] Babylon, you will perish.
[2:42:39] &gt;&gt; Everybody under Babylon.
[2:42:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:42:43] &gt;&gt; I'm the one taking you there.
[2:42:45] &gt;&gt; And I'm the one who's going to take you
[2:42:46] up. In other word, when you're going,
[2:42:49] I'm going with you.
[2:42:53] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:42:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:42:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42:56] &gt;&gt; Job to verse 14. And then we come back
[2:42:58] up again.
[2:43:00] &gt;&gt; And I will be what?
[2:43:02] &gt;&gt; Found of you.
[2:43:03] &gt;&gt; Say the Lord. And I will do what?
[2:43:05] &gt;&gt; Turn away your captivity.
[2:43:07] &gt;&gt; Go back again. He say, I will be what?
[2:43:10] &gt;&gt; Found in you.
[2:43:10] &gt;&gt; What does God say?
[2:43:12] &gt;&gt; God will be what?
[2:43:14] &gt;&gt; Of you. But if you go before time and
[2:43:16] you search God,
[2:43:18] &gt;&gt; God will hide from you.
[2:43:21] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you understand,
[2:43:23] &gt;&gt; but when the season of deliverance come,
[2:43:26] God will be fond of you. In other words,
[2:43:28] God is looking for you. When you go this
[2:43:30] way, he say, "I'm here. I'm here. I'm
[2:43:32] here."
[2:43:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:43:38] &gt;&gt; So what happened? Israel carried away
[2:43:40] captive.
[2:43:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43:41] &gt;&gt; For a period of time. And when they get
[2:43:44] there in captivity among them they have
[2:43:47] prophet
[2:43:49] &gt;&gt; and priest and divine they begin to give
[2:43:51] them messages that they going to go
[2:43:53] back.
[2:43:54] &gt;&gt; Now the the the message now is
[2:43:56] confusing.
[2:43:57] &gt;&gt; The major prophet say 70.
[2:44:00] &gt;&gt; These are saying two years. Even ananiah
[2:44:02] die
[2:44:03] &gt;&gt; he say two years and the lord kill him.
[2:44:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:44:08] &gt;&gt; Now the major prophet send instruction.
[2:44:11] Amen.
[2:44:11] &gt;&gt; He said, "Hey, don't stay like people
[2:44:14] who are in the air.
[2:44:19] &gt;&gt; Don't because there is a difference. If
[2:44:21] you come here
[2:44:23] &gt;&gt; and we tell you that on Tuesday you will
[2:44:25] go
[2:44:26] &gt;&gt; if you have a luggage, you won't you
[2:44:29] won't open everything
[2:44:30] &gt;&gt; because you need to keep your luggage a
[2:44:32] certain way
[2:44:33] &gt;&gt; because on Tuesday you must make sure
[2:44:35] everything is packed so you can go. But
[2:44:37] if they tell you in six months you go,
[2:44:40] you will unload everything
[2:44:42] &gt;&gt; because you have a lot of time. So when
[2:44:44] they told Israel, it's a short period of
[2:44:47] time. Israel stay with their luggage.
[2:44:50] &gt;&gt; Some were sleeping at the airport.
[2:44:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:44:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:44:55] &gt;&gt; Now the word of the Lord come. Let's go
[2:44:57] back to verse five.
[2:45:00] My time is pretty much up. I need to
[2:45:02] drop. We there. Verse five. The word of
[2:45:06] the Lord came to the people that were
[2:45:08] carrying what? captive. God says what?
[2:45:11] &gt;&gt; Building houses
[2:45:13] &gt;&gt; and dwelling that
[2:45:15] &gt;&gt; can we can we read together?
[2:45:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:45:18] &gt;&gt; God is saying what?
[2:45:20] &gt;&gt; Build houses
[2:45:21] &gt;&gt; where Babylon.
[2:45:24] &gt;&gt; If God instructs you to build a house,
[2:45:28] &gt;&gt; it is not you who want to build a house.
[2:45:30] &gt;&gt; God is telling you, you see where you
[2:45:33] were, build a house there. What does he
[2:45:36] mean? The blessing of the Lord is right
[2:45:39] there.
[2:45:42] &gt;&gt; In other words, if you go back to the
[2:45:45] promised land,
[2:45:46] &gt;&gt; you will you will you will suffer.
[2:45:51] &gt;&gt; Father, help this church.
[2:45:53] &gt;&gt; Let me start it again.
[2:45:55] &gt;&gt; As much as you want to go to the
[2:45:57] promised land,
[2:45:58] &gt;&gt; if you go to the promised land
[2:46:01] &gt;&gt; out of season, in other words, God is
[2:46:03] telling you, I'm in Babylon.
[2:46:05] &gt;&gt; I'm in. I am the one that is blessing
[2:46:07] Nebuchadnezzar.
[2:46:09] &gt;&gt; My blessing is upon Nebuchadnezzar.
[2:46:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:46:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:15] &gt;&gt; Nebuchadnezzar is my servant.
[2:46:18] &gt;&gt; Since there is a curse in Israel because
[2:46:21] Israel trespass, I'm moving you where my
[2:46:24] blessing is.
[2:46:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:46:27] &gt;&gt; I hope you we are together.
[2:46:29] &gt;&gt; But Israel is caught up with the word
[2:46:32] captive. Amen.
[2:46:35] &gt;&gt; I'm a captive.
[2:46:36] &gt;&gt; I'm a captive.
[2:46:38] &gt;&gt; I'm a prisoner. I'm a p. Forget about
[2:46:40] the prisoner. Can a prisoner be a
[2:46:43] manager?
[2:46:44] &gt;&gt; Can a captive built a house?
[2:46:46] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:46:47] &gt;&gt; So you're not really captive.
[2:46:49] &gt;&gt; It is a different season.
[2:46:52] &gt;&gt; A season for the gentile.
[2:46:54] [Applause]
[2:46:59] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:47:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Let me start again.
[2:47:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:47:06] &gt;&gt; God told Nebuchadnezzar,
[2:47:08] &gt;&gt; I'm giving. He told Jeremiah, I'm
[2:47:11] blessing Nebuchadnezzar, every nation
[2:47:13] under him.
[2:47:14] &gt;&gt; If I go back to the scripture, he even
[2:47:16] said that Nebuchadnezzar will reign and
[2:47:18] his children will reign and his children
[2:47:21] and kings will come from there.
[2:47:23] &gt;&gt; In other words, there is a time and he
[2:47:25] says until his reign be to an end. Amen.
[2:47:28] &gt;&gt; But because the blessing of the Lord are
[2:47:31] going there,
[2:47:33] &gt;&gt; sir,
[2:47:34] &gt;&gt; Israel is under curse.
[2:47:37] &gt;&gt; Because they overuse the land,
[2:47:39] &gt;&gt; God chose a captive
[2:47:43] &gt;&gt; and moved them out
[2:47:45] &gt;&gt; and bring them to Babylon.
[2:47:47] &gt;&gt; And when they brought to Babylon, they
[2:47:50] came with the mentality of a captive. A
[2:47:53] captive is somebody who is away
[2:47:56] &gt;&gt; and who have a tendency to free himself
[2:47:59] to go back.
[2:48:00] &gt;&gt; Now God came he said remove that
[2:48:02] mentality.
[2:48:04] &gt;&gt; I am where you are.
[2:48:06] &gt;&gt; You see the house of pifer I am right
[2:48:09] there.
[2:48:10] &gt;&gt; Open your eyes.
[2:48:12] &gt;&gt; Find some real estate.
[2:48:15] [Music]
[2:48:18] Let me go back again because our point
[2:48:21] is we in Babylon.
[2:48:26] &gt;&gt; Why don't you work? I'm in Babylon.
[2:48:31] &gt;&gt; Remember Israel went there and they
[2:48:33] asked them to sing.
[2:48:35] [Applause]
[2:48:37] &gt;&gt; Do you remember that?
[2:48:39] &gt;&gt; It's in Psalm 100 20 something. They
[2:48:42] asked them to sing because when Israel,
[2:48:45] Ira, Babylon, they took the their harp
[2:48:48] and they laid them on the willow.
[2:48:50] &gt;&gt; They say we can't sing. And the people
[2:48:52] come, they say, "Sing us. Go ahead. It's
[2:48:55] your season." Isaiah say, "Huh? How can
[2:48:58] we sing the song of Zion
[2:49:00] &gt;&gt; in a strange land?" They didn't know God
[2:49:02] was in that strange land.
[2:49:04] &gt;&gt; In other words, I sing it my season
[2:49:06] everywhere I'm going.
[2:49:11] [Applause]
[2:49:13] Are we together?
[2:49:15] &gt;&gt; Because everywhere the soul of my foot
[2:49:18] get
[2:49:20] &gt;&gt; God have given to me.
[2:49:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:49:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together? The plan of 70 is God.
[2:49:29] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:49:30] &gt;&gt; Israel is sitting there without
[2:49:32] instruction and the prophet send the
[2:49:34] instruction. He said tell the people
[2:49:36] that are there.
[2:49:38] &gt;&gt; The demand is always
[2:49:40] the day we will return to Zion.
[2:49:43] &gt;&gt; The day we will go back to Israel.
[2:49:45] &gt;&gt; Can we go to McDonald? No, no, no. Not
[2:49:47] at this time. Wait till we go back to
[2:49:48] Zion. Wait till they go back to So
[2:49:51] everything, every anointing that is in
[2:49:53] the house of piper,
[2:49:55] &gt;&gt; that is in the prison, Israel doesn't
[2:49:57] see that
[2:49:59] &gt;&gt; because their mind is they cursed me
[2:50:01] away from my father. They took me away
[2:50:03] from my mother. My brother did this and
[2:50:05] God is working and God send instruction.
[2:50:08] He say hey remove the mentality.
[2:50:11] &gt;&gt; Open your eyes.
[2:50:12] &gt;&gt; I am the one that took you where you
[2:50:15] are.

[2:50:19] &gt;&gt; I'm the one that took you there.
[2:50:23] &gt;&gt; You see where you are now in your life.
[2:50:26] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me.
[2:50:27] &gt;&gt; Some of you want to go home.
[2:50:29] &gt;&gt; You see where you are. You see the stage
[2:50:32] that you are in life. I'm the one that
[2:50:34] took you there.
[2:50:36] &gt;&gt; Before you were born, I was with you.
[2:50:39] &gt;&gt; When you were in your mother's womb, I
[2:50:41] was with you.
[2:50:42] &gt;&gt; Many of your brother die. You overcame
[2:50:45] because I made you overcame. You got
[2:50:48] sick and everything. You never die. I'm
[2:50:50] the one with you.
[2:50:52] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:50:55] stop looking at everything else. Open
[2:50:58] your eyes
[2:51:00] &gt;&gt; and seize the opportunity around you.
[2:51:07] [Applause]
[2:51:10] &gt;&gt; You don't get me, my friend.

[2:51:26] sister. Boom. We need to get married. We
[2:51:29] need to get married. We need to get

[2:52:40] &gt;&gt; When you build a house, is it something
[2:52:42] you can dislo uh I mean uh move?
[2:52:45] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:52:45] &gt;&gt; God didn't say build mobile house.

[3:08:15] seizing the opportunity to save money,
[3:08:18] to prepare your credit, to prepare your
[3:08:21] life, to prepare everything, you rested
[3:08:24] because of a husband, because of a wife.
[3:08:32] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you get me. I took that
[3:08:34] example as the simplest example I can
[3:08:37] get. So, you can apply it everywhere.
[3:08:40] There is a reason why you in the state
[3:08:42] you are now.
[3:08:45] [Applause]
[3:08:47] &gt;&gt; There is a reason why you are where you
[3:08:49] are now.
[3:08:51] &gt;&gt; What you doing?
[3:08:52] &gt;&gt; Traveling.
[3:08:53] &gt;&gt; Traveling.
[3:08:54] &gt;&gt; Traveling. Traveling. Credit card. Swap.
[3:08:57] Credit card in credit card. Swap. Buying
[3:08:59] Amazon. Amazon. Amazon. Amazon.
[3:09:03] &gt;&gt; There will come a season.
[3:09:05] &gt;&gt; There will come a season.
[3:09:07] &gt;&gt; All that free time.
[3:09:09] will be taken away.
[3:09:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:09:16] &gt;&gt; So God is telling you today with the
[3:09:18] wisdom of Isaka, you know which season
[3:09:21] you going,
[3:09:22] &gt;&gt; open your eyes.
[3:09:23] &gt;&gt; Get to business.
[3:09:29] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you get me.
[3:09:31] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you get me.
[3:09:36] &gt;&gt; Let me stop here, my friend. We will
[3:09:38] pick up
[3:09:39] &gt;&gt; in this wisdom of issakar
[3:09:42] &gt;&gt; and give you more instruction again.
[3:09:44] What do you do and show you how your
[3:09:45] life is moving
[3:09:46] &gt;&gt; and how you need to act with it.
[3:09:49] &gt;&gt; Man reason God is in every season.
[3:09:53] &gt;&gt; Whether it's a bad season for you
[3:09:56] &gt;&gt; or it's a good season for you,
[3:09:59] &gt;&gt; God is there.
[3:10:00] &gt;&gt; He's in and out of season. All right.
[3:10:03] &gt;&gt; God doesn't make you move
[3:10:06] &gt;&gt; just as a stupid man.
[3:10:09] &gt;&gt; God knows what he's doing in your life.
[3:10:12] &gt;&gt; God knows why you are going through what
[3:10:15] you going now.
[3:10:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:10:18] &gt;&gt; Don't push.
[3:10:19] &gt;&gt; No. Amen.
[3:10:20] &gt;&gt; Don't fight.
[3:10:22] &gt;&gt; Relax.
[3:10:23] &gt;&gt; Sit and open your eyes.
[3:10:26] &gt;&gt; Why am I here?
[3:10:29] &gt;&gt; What am I doing here?
[3:10:31] Because the day you will start paying
[3:10:33] for your cell phone,
[3:10:35] &gt;&gt; you won't come out of it.
[3:10:39] &gt;&gt; Maybe you don't understand me.
[3:10:41] &gt;&gt; There was a time daddy was paying for
[3:10:42] your cell phone.
[3:10:44] &gt;&gt; After a while, daddy don't pay for your
[3:10:46] cell phone. Hallelujah.
[3:10:47] &gt;&gt; You will stay with that bill
[3:10:49] &gt;&gt; until the rapture.
[3:10:53] &gt;&gt; If you got grace, your husband may pick
[3:10:55] it up.
[3:10:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:10:56] &gt;&gt; But if it's not, you have it.
[3:10:58] &gt;&gt; If you a man, you have it. Yes sir.
[3:11:00] That's it.
[3:11:01] &gt;&gt; Today you don't pay a house.
[3:11:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[3:11:03] &gt;&gt; There will come a time you going to get
[3:11:05] in a mortgage.
[3:11:06] &gt;&gt; There will come a time you going to rent
[3:11:08] an apartment.
[3:11:10] &gt;&gt; You will regret Yes, sir.
[3:11:12] &gt;&gt; the time you are staying with your
[3:11:13] father.
[3:11:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:11:15] &gt;&gt; You will regret
[3:11:16] &gt;&gt; when you start paying your car.
[3:11:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[3:11:19] &gt;&gt; You will regret when you won't have time
[3:11:21] again
[3:11:22] &gt;&gt; to be in church.
[3:11:24] &gt;&gt; You will regret when they will close
[3:11:26] churches.
[3:11:32] We are in a spiritual Babylon.
[3:11:35] &gt;&gt; Babylon is all over the land. The
[3:11:37] Catholic Church is sitting in this
[3:11:39] nation. The Pope is an American. Babylon
[3:11:43] is in America. Wake up and seize your
[3:11:46] opportunity.
[3:11:52] &gt;&gt; Young people, when daddy can pay for the
[3:11:54] school fee, go to school. If you need to
[3:11:58] work, work seriously.
[3:12:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:12:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:12:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:12:03] &gt;&gt; Because if you miss this time,
[3:12:06] &gt;&gt; if you miss this time,
[3:12:08] &gt;&gt; you will be regretting.
[3:12:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:12:10] &gt;&gt; That I wish when I was there, I wish two
[3:12:13] years ago, I wish I was saving my money
[3:12:16] because now you have two bills.
[3:12:18] &gt;&gt; When you get to your own apartment, you
[3:12:20] begin to pay for the apartment. You
[3:12:22] begin to pay for the gas. You begin to
[3:12:24] pay for the water. You begin to pay for
[3:12:26] this. You begin to pay for tam cable
[3:12:28] AT&T. You pay for your insurance. You
[3:12:31] pay for this. Your big paycheck is no
[3:12:34] longer big. It become very thin like
[3:12:36] this. You don't know how to save. Before
[3:12:40] you know it, your husband must work. You
[3:12:43] must work. And you are going pregnant at
[3:12:46] home and work because you cannot quit
[3:12:49] work because you didn't budget your
[3:12:51] future. You didn't look like an ant that
[3:12:54] let me prepare my home. Let me prepare
[3:12:57] my future. A wise woman built her home.
[3:13:01] Let me build my home now. Let me build
[3:13:04] my house right now so that tomorrow
[3:13:07] things are going to be easy for me.
[3:13:09] &gt;&gt; Young man, focus.
[3:13:11] [Music]
[3:13:12] &gt;&gt; Young man, focus.
[3:13:15] Leave your friend. Leave them alone. Get
[3:13:18] your friend away.
[3:13:22] Friend, friend, friend, friend. What did
[3:13:24] your friend do for you?
[3:13:27] &gt;&gt; They always take you to the places to
[3:13:29] spend money.
[3:13:31] &gt;&gt; The Bible say at 12 years old,
[3:13:34] &gt;&gt; Jesus was not even hanging on
[3:13:36] &gt;&gt; with his friend. At 12 years old,
[3:13:39] &gt;&gt; without the Holy Ghost,
[3:13:41] &gt;&gt; 12 years old without friend. Look what
[3:13:43] your friend did to you. Your friend take
[3:13:46] you out of church. Your friend make you
[3:13:48] spend money. Your friend may take you
[3:13:50] out of everything that is godly.
[3:13:54] &gt;&gt; One of this day,
[3:13:56] &gt;&gt; you will be seeking for God.
[3:13:59] &gt;&gt; The deacon knows what I'm talking about.
[3:14:01] &gt;&gt; I'm dealing with a lot of marital
[3:14:03] problem
[3:14:04] &gt;&gt; that are not even part of this church.
[3:14:06] &gt;&gt; People outside. I'm dealing with it.
[3:14:09] &gt;&gt; You never seen what I go through.
[3:14:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:14:12] &gt;&gt; That's it, brother.
[3:14:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:14:13] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[3:14:15] &gt;&gt; Why? Because that preparation was
[3:14:17] missed.
[3:14:17] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[3:14:19] &gt;&gt; You will be sitting looking at five
[3:14:20] children there
[3:14:22] &gt;&gt; and you begin to pray for the soul of
[3:14:24] their children.
[3:14:25] &gt;&gt; Father, may I bring these children to
[3:14:26] church because you yourself miss it?
[3:14:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:14:29] &gt;&gt; You don't even know how to impart
[3:14:31] eternal life to them.
[3:14:32] &gt;&gt; Jesus. Jesus.
[3:14:34] &gt;&gt; How are you going to tell them to read
[3:14:35] the Bible when you yourself don't read
[3:14:38] your Bible?
[3:14:39] &gt;&gt; How are you going to tell them to read
[3:14:40] the churches? Mama never finish the
[3:14:42] churches.
[3:14:44] &gt;&gt; How are you going to tell your boy that
[3:14:46] you need to read this? If he ask you a
[3:14:48] question, mama, have you read it
[3:14:50] yourself? What are you going to do? God
[3:14:52] is giving you time now. Seize your
[3:14:55] opportunity. Seize your time. Seize the
[3:14:58] moment. Build house, live there, dwell
[3:15:02] there, build and do what is necessary
[3:15:07] because there is a season. Let us all
[3:15:09] stand my brother.
[3:15:11] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[3:15:14] Amen.
[3:15:18] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[3:15:20] &gt;&gt; Don't worry, my friend. I'm going to
[3:15:21] show you even how to save it
[3:15:24] &gt;&gt; in this Bible.
[3:15:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:15:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:15:26] &gt;&gt; I'm not getting where I'm trying to get,
[3:15:28] but I will show you. Amen.
[3:15:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:15:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:15:32] &gt;&gt; That state is a demonic state.
[3:15:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[3:15:36] &gt;&gt; A state of uncertainty.
[3:15:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[3:15:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, ma'am.
[3:15:40] &gt;&gt; I'm in this marriage.
[3:15:42] [Music]
[3:15:44] I believe I married the wrong one.
[3:15:48] &gt;&gt; So we must dwell wait
[3:15:50] &gt;&gt; because brother Brandham say on the
[3:15:52] other side
[3:15:53] &gt;&gt; everything will be corrected.
[3:15:56] &gt;&gt; Look how a hell
[3:15:58] &gt;&gt; you are going through.
[3:16:00] &gt;&gt; Father the footstep of the righteous
[3:16:04] &gt;&gt; are order by thee.
[3:16:06] &gt;&gt; When I was born I didn't know myself.
[3:16:09] &gt;&gt; I knew you were there. I knew you allow
[3:16:11] me to marry this man.
[3:16:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:16:14] &gt;&gt; I knew you allow me to meet this man and
[3:16:16] we have children.
[3:16:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:16:18] &gt;&gt; And he's struggling. What is my season?
[3:16:21] &gt;&gt; What am I doing in this marriage? What
[3:16:23] am I supposed to do at this time that
[3:16:25] I'm going through this trial?
[3:16:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:16:31] &gt;&gt; Husband left.
[3:16:33] &gt;&gt; You were home depressed.
[3:16:36] &gt;&gt; Do you know when he's going to come like
[3:16:37] a prodigal son?
[3:16:39] Go ahead.
[3:16:40] &gt;&gt; You can't work because husband left.
[3:16:43] &gt;&gt; Hey,
[3:16:45] &gt;&gt; life is no more sense because of the
[3:16:48] tragedy that happened to me.
[3:16:50] &gt;&gt; Don't do that.
[3:16:52] &gt;&gt; He left. It is mine. I take him and put
[3:16:56] him under the blood.
[3:16:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[3:16:58] &gt;&gt; And I claim his soul.
[3:17:00] &gt;&gt; One of this day, as sure as the promised
[3:17:03] son come,
[3:17:05] &gt;&gt; you will come back.
[3:17:06] &gt;&gt; The prodigal son, you will come back.
[3:17:08] But I'm going to be tormented. I'm not
[3:17:10] going to stay here tormented by the
[3:17:12] thought that you left.
[3:17:14] &gt;&gt; Let me refocus.
[3:17:15] &gt;&gt; Let me deal with my children. Let me
[3:17:17] focus on my children. Let me pray for
[3:17:19] them because I know one of these day you
[3:17:21] going to knock the door.
[3:17:22] &gt;&gt; And when you turn your head, you begin
[3:17:24] to look, then you'll see God showing you
[3:17:26] what you need to do while he's working
[3:17:28] with Darascal over there.
[3:17:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:17:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:17:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:17:34] &gt;&gt; If not, you stay doing nothing.
[3:17:36] &gt;&gt; That's it. Right.
[3:17:38] &gt;&gt; And you move from apartment to
[3:17:39] apartment.
[3:17:40] &gt;&gt; From apartment to apartment.
[3:17:42] &gt;&gt; Today the address goes to this mail.
[3:17:45] Tomorrow this mail. Tomorrow this mail.
[3:17:48] &gt;&gt; It doesn't bother you. You got used to
[3:17:50] it. Why can't you have a home fixed?
[3:17:56] &gt;&gt; Build your house.
[3:17:58] &gt;&gt; Plant your vineyard.
[3:18:01] &gt;&gt; Let me focus. Let me get busy on my
[3:18:04] relationship with the Lord
[3:18:06] &gt;&gt; and keep moving.
[3:18:07] &gt;&gt; If he comes, praise the Lord.
[3:18:09] &gt;&gt; If he doesn't come, I go to the rapture.
[3:18:11] &gt;&gt; That's it. Amen.
[3:18:13] &gt;&gt; Because you are living in a prison.
[3:18:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:18:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:18:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:18:20] &gt;&gt; A prison of a wife,
[3:18:21] &gt;&gt; a prison of a house,
[3:18:23] &gt;&gt; a prison of the past.
[3:18:25] &gt;&gt; A prison of they did this to me, they
[3:18:26] did this to me, they did this to me. Get
[3:18:28] they did this to me out.
[3:18:32] I'm like this because of the way our
[3:18:34] mama raised us. Release your mother
[3:18:36] today.
[3:18:38] &gt;&gt; Release that uncle today.
[3:18:42] &gt;&gt; Release that aunt that molested you
[3:18:44] today.
[3:18:46] &gt;&gt; Release that father that abused your
[3:18:49] your mother today.
[3:18:51] &gt;&gt; Release that mother that abused your
[3:18:53] father today.
[3:18:54] &gt;&gt; Get that out of your mind.
[3:18:56] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[3:18:58] &gt;&gt; look where I am at. Focus on what I'm
[3:19:01] doing.
[3:19:01] &gt;&gt; This is an individual work.
[3:19:03] &gt;&gt; Pay attention to your life and me, God.
[3:19:07] &gt;&gt; Let me and you deal.
[3:19:12] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[3:19:14] &gt;&gt; Instead of losing time,
[3:19:15] &gt;&gt; losing time,
[3:19:16] &gt;&gt; you will gain resources.
[3:19:18] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[3:19:19] &gt;&gt; Because my blessing are in Paris. I'm in
[3:19:22] Babylon right there.
[3:19:23] &gt;&gt; In the midst of Babylon, I'm there.
[3:19:26] &gt;&gt; I will cause you to go back. I know when
[3:19:28] I will take you back.
[3:19:30] [Music]
[3:19:34] &gt;&gt; Instead of buying a solid chair, you're
[3:19:36] going to buy a cheap chair.
[3:19:39] &gt;&gt; Who told you you're going to leave
[3:19:40] tomorrow?
[3:19:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:19:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:19:44] &gt;&gt; Who told you you're going to quit that
[3:19:45] job tomorrow?
[3:19:47] &gt;&gt; You quit. You search for job. No job
[3:19:50] &gt;&gt; because you did it yourself.
[3:19:51] &gt;&gt; Yes. Right. Right. Amen.
[3:19:54] &gt;&gt; With an impulsive faith.
[3:19:57] Speak the word. Speak the word. Speak
[3:19:58] the word. Uh-huh. Go speak the word out.
[3:20:01] No more job. I don't know if the spoken
[3:20:03] word thinks it's working or not
[3:20:05] &gt;&gt; because you did it yourself.
[3:20:08] &gt;&gt; You didn't work with the season.
[3:20:10] &gt;&gt; Stay calm.
[3:20:12] &gt;&gt; Stay calm.
[3:20:13] &gt;&gt; When the anointing come, speak the word.
[3:20:15] &gt;&gt; When you speak the word in season, in
[3:20:18] the season of square,
[3:20:19] &gt;&gt; it will happen.
[3:20:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the wisdom of Isakar, you
[3:20:23] must know how to discern the time. and
[3:20:26] to know what to do in the time.
[3:20:28] &gt;&gt; Church, I'm insisting this. I don't know
[3:20:30] why I'm insisting this because we cannot
[3:20:33] continue going the way we going.
[3:20:36] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[3:20:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, we stop the project and wait till
[3:20:40] our bank account are filled
[3:20:42] &gt;&gt; before we continue building.
[3:20:46] &gt;&gt; That's what we're supposed to do. So
[3:20:47] when we have $2 million, we can begin to
[3:20:51] go ahead and build the church. No,
[3:20:53] ma'am. No, no. God is giving me favor to
[3:20:58] the medicine. He's giving favor to this
[3:21:00] build the contractor. Let me seize this
[3:21:03] opportunity.
[3:21:04] &gt;&gt; It's taking step by step.
[3:21:06] &gt;&gt; But at the end of the day, we will be
[3:21:08] sitting in that fellowship eating.
[3:21:11] [Music]
[3:21:12] &gt;&gt; It's not the way we want it. The way we
[3:21:14] wanted is get a loan, get everything
[3:21:16] financed. But that's not the way he
[3:21:18] chose us
[3:21:19] &gt;&gt; because purposely I don't want that.
[3:21:22] &gt;&gt; I'm going this way. It's a hard way. But
[3:21:24] I'm not taking I'm not joking with it
[3:21:27] because sometime the season will change
[3:21:29] and that door will close. That's right.
[3:21:31] &gt;&gt; And if you miss it, every time you will
[3:21:34] try to now rebuild this build the
[3:21:36] church, you will see how much you're
[3:21:38] going to suffer.
[3:21:39] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[3:21:39] &gt;&gt; And if they tell you today the interest
[3:21:42] went up,
[3:21:42] &gt;&gt; you lost the period that the interest
[3:21:45] was down.
[3:21:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:21:47] &gt;&gt; Now you're going to pay double
[3:21:48] &gt;&gt; from if you have se it.
[3:21:51] People are buying house.
[3:21:54] &gt;&gt; People are moving.
[3:21:55] &gt;&gt; People are graduating. People are
[3:21:57] putting furniture.
[3:21:58] &gt;&gt; People are getting married. Look what
[3:22:00] you're doing.
[3:22:04] &gt;&gt; There's a time to get to college. Work
[3:22:07] quickly. Get out of the college.
[3:22:09] &gt;&gt; We can't stay in the college for
[3:22:10] eternity.
[3:22:14] &gt;&gt; I'm still working on my major. I'm still
[3:22:16] working on my major. I'm still working
[3:22:17] on my major. I'm still working on my
[3:22:18] major.
[3:22:23] Heavenly Father,
[3:22:25] &gt;&gt; Lord, we approaching you humbly this
[3:22:27] afternoon.
[3:22:28] &gt;&gt; Father, thanking you for your grace, for
[3:22:30] your love, for your mercy, and for
[3:22:33] everything you have been doing for us.
[3:22:36] &gt;&gt; Father, it only take the grace of God to
[3:22:39] come and bring us such an instruction
[3:22:43] because the devil knows how to play in a
[3:22:45] man. And your prophet taught us that
[3:22:47] since the garden of Eden, he chose the
[3:22:50] head, but you chose the heart. Father,
[3:22:53] our head has been bombarded so much.
[3:22:56] Our happiness has been lowered in prison
[3:23:00] in Portivar's home have been center into
[3:23:04] the thought that we captive that I'm not
[3:23:06] where I'm supposed to be. We already
[3:23:08] know that. But father,
[3:23:11] is there anything in this path you are
[3:23:14] taking us through? Is there anything in
[3:23:18] this place that you are taking us? Is
[3:23:20] there anything we need to glean out of
[3:23:23] this place that we are in today? Or are
[3:23:26] we just settling and waiting until we
[3:23:29] get to that elorado? Father, may you
[3:23:32] come down in the heart of every
[3:23:34] believer, everyone that is listening
[3:23:36] online. Lord, Father, may this wisdom be
[3:23:40] granted to all of us. Father, you know
[3:23:43] what each person is going through their
[3:23:45] life, their individual life. Lord, you
[3:23:48] know their specific season. You know the
[3:23:51] time that they going through, what they
[3:23:52] going through. You know, because you
[3:23:54] took them there and you're going to take
[3:23:56] them out. But father, may they seize the
[3:23:59] opportunity. May they take advantage of
[3:24:02] the season where they are instead of
[3:24:04] sitting. But may Lord, Father, the Holy
[3:24:07] Spirit guide them through divine precise
[3:24:10] instruction that will hotel them and let
[3:24:13] them seize whatever you have planned for
[3:24:15] them in the time that they're going
[3:24:17] through. Lord, I pray that you give them
[3:24:20] a special blessing for staying over
[3:24:22] time. Lord, Father, strengthen our body
[3:24:25] and protect us. And may you protect my
[3:24:27] wife as she's going to get ready to come
[3:24:29] back. May Lord, Father, you give her
[3:24:31] travel mercy. Lord take Lord Father this
[3:24:34] oncoming weekend to thy hand. Bless us
[3:24:36] Lord Father in the name of Jesus Christ.
[3:24:40] Amen.
[3:24:41] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry church I took while God bless
[3:24:44] you. We love you.
