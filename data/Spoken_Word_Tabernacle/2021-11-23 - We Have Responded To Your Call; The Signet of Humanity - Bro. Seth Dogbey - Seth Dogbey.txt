be identified with your sacrifice amen oh my my my the folks in ohio are one step ahead of you [Laughter] unless they put it on youtube quickly if not you got to hear it again amen i'm going to read the roman chapter 6. i just failed to read this since brother robert was uh singing that song be identified with your sacrifice and talking about justification then sister jerusha bring in the grace his grace justified never done it to begin with that's the thanksgiving message amen oh my roman chapter one day lord's willing if he terry we will we will dig into this through the jordan river amen so maybe somebody will go search it but there is a message already we're just following the gps when he say go left we go left the first three no you're not but just a little bit no ye not i use a bazooka in llama and it works pretty good the microphone start acting up then they brought it to me like they brought jesus the scroll at the temple i was like that's it amen no ye not that so many of us as were baptized into jesus christ were baptized into his death you identify amen with your sacrifice verse 4 therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death do we stay there he never stood there he had to come out and what do you think the dead in christ will do what amen that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in units of life for if we have been planted together identification in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection there is no way you can be identified with his death and not being identified with his resurrection amen if we were identified with his death automatically we are guaranteed that we're going to be identified with his resurrection amen paul continued he said in verse 6 knowing this that our old man is crucified with who so when they were crucifying jesus christ guess who was inside them who was in jesus name you see he waited until he say it is finished when he say it is finished that's when they pierce him not before when he say it is finished that's when they pierce him in other words the bride has been living in the groom have seen the groom caster devil walk in the water doing all kinds of things and even go all the way to redemption when he finished paying the price now he's saying now you know what to do right now come out now i can deliver you [Laughter] the problem is spiritual amnesia everything is already built in you all it takes is the quickening power of the holy spirit once he quickens you then the program that christ did when he was here on earth automatically begin to work on you that's why paul said it is no longer me that live the life that i live right now i live it by the faith of the son of god sorry i'm not the one preaching he got it [Laughter] amen verse six knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin but robert we free verse 7 for he that is dead is what free from water automatically jump to verse 8 11 likewise reckon yourself also where can you also yourself to be dead in other words paul wants you to be conscious to to acknowledge that you are dead dead to what that sin he said reckon he also yourself to be dead indeed unto sin but a love unto god through jesus christ our lord now verse 12 let not water he's talking to who so you can let sin work or you can lock him. i'm reading the same bible right he said let you let not sin rain in your water so you already have power to control the black dog when esther invited haman to the banquet a man didn't have any choice he was obeying esther and the chamberlain were there to make sure him and get into the chariot and be carried over there the enforcer were there this world i don't know what to do my brother amen let not sin therefore when in your mortal body that you should obey it in the last water so you have a right to say no and he have nothing to do he has to negotiate with you but if you say no it means no because you are raining you are ruling you under the species of melchizedek those that were you know how you understand you under the species of melchizedek melchizedek is not only priests but he's also i'm back home [Laughter] let me stop here my brother god richly bless you i know the whole church is not here some are streaming but i want to thank you all for your prayer i can tell my schedule was super tight very very tight and all i was doing around 2 3 am in the morning have to preach in the morning and say i know there is somebody somewhere that is praying for me amen and we can feel the anointing i'm telling you it was like heaven you met people the first time it looks like we met for all this year and we understood the mystery we were coming from the same origin amen i cannot even remember all their name but they were such a wonderful welcoming spirit amen i sent by the child the text when i landed i said i landed he said you get prepared for your next trip amen so we really thank you for the support staying in church and brother kelly fill it in and i heard that you had a wonderful service here blessed be the name of the lord we return all the glory all the honor back to the lord jesus christ amen so if you have a chance i already i already seen they have uh loaded the first sermon on saturday morning it's already on youtube probably sooner they're gonna load the second one if you get the second one so you'll be right on page amen if not you gotta learn a little bit more amen blessed be the name of the lord i know there is a lot of traveling going on so you remember those that are traveling for thanksgiving back and forth so the lord protect them because the road is really busy and it's booked so happy thanksgiving to everybody we appreciate you pressing on tonight and tonight i'm not preaching but i have a surprise for some of you [Laughter] some of you it's not a

we bless you in jesus christ let me pray amen and amen amen can we be seated amen amen amen in fact it is not easy to um to stand here amen [Laughter] knowing the gift that we have in this church man it is not easy to be called upon to come and minister to this church amen and i just want to say thank you to the pastor amen and thank you to everybody this evening amen and i know you are going to preach with me tonight lord amen amen but uh before that i just want to give a testimony um um it's been um i think two or three weeks ago my wife was like um she calls me babe you know she's like babe when was the last time you took your inhaler and i was like um i can't remember but maybe the first week i came to charlotte since then the lord took away that demon called amen amen so um it started way back in ghana when anytime i decide to stand on my feet to pray then this kind of wind gets into my truth and then it starts to close up my lungs so it was so hard it was so difficult and i brought it here to the states but thanks be to god that inhaler that i was taking every night is no more amen amen amen i just want to praise the lord tonight amen amen amen i wanted to talk a little bit about that but for times sake let's just go straight to the wedding man should we be outstanding even as we take uh a scripture reading from the book of hagai haggai chapter 2 verse 23 in fact it is a deep thing to talk about but i'm just going to brush the surface amen but lord help me tonight amen but he said the book of hakka 2 23. he said in that day said the lord of hosts will i take d o zerubbabel my servant the son of shear tale saith the lord and will make thee as a sickness for i have chosen thee said the lord of hosts amen can we be seated um my topic for tonight is we have responded to your call we have responded we are not responding but we have responded amen to your call amen and i i have a sub team the sickness of humanity the sickness of humanity amen i know um brad stevens preached on that amen and he opened my eyes to something amen so um before we come to that let's go to um the book of job job chapter 2 chapter 2 verses 1-8 again there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and satan came also among them to present himself before the lord so this is the second time that he was coming and the lord said unto satan from whence cometh down and satan answered the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it you know i listened to a sermon that brought stephen preached he said that the devil doesn't have a place to stay he's just moving to and fro amen of course he was cast he was taken out of his place so he doesn't have a place amen and the lord said unto satan has thou considered my servant joke this is the second time that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man one that feared god and as steward evil and still he hold the fastest integrity so we know that the first time god took away all the things that job had so he's saying that have you considered him again he said after all what i did to him he hold that fast his integrity although thou moves me against him to destroy him with our cross now this is the devil who was trying to fight god in heaven and the lord cast him down to earth and he didn't have a place now god is telling the devil that you the devil you moved me against my servant so this is a devil who the lord caused my enemy he calls him an evil one but he said you moved me if the devil could move god against his will how much more you the son of god that child of god who stand in prayer amen and amen he said you moved me against my servant amen he said and satan answered the lord and said skin for skin yeah all that a man have will will he give for his life but put forth thine hand now and touch his bone and his flesh and he will curse thee to that face so as we learn from what stephen preached the whole objective is for job to curse the lord and the lord said unto satan behold he is in the hand but save his life so when satan fought from the presence of the lord and smote joke with saw boys from the soul of his foot onto onto his crown and he took him a portrait to scrape himself without and he sat down among the ashes let's go to verse 11. now when job's three friends ahead of all this evil that was come upon him they came everyone from his own place elephants the terminites and builder the shoe height and sofa the pneumatics for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him they had made an appointment to come and moan with him and comfort him let's go to verse 13. so they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights and none speak a word unto him for they saw that he greet his grief was very great now let's see what happens in um three verse one after this opened up his mouth and cast his day now you have friends in the church these are let me say believers who said oh our friend is suffering so let's go visit our friends but this is the type of believers that came to job after they sat with him seven days they were showing they're trying to show to him the spirit of love but i see it as a manufactured love because there's no love that when it is shown will make somebody start to curse if a love is being shown to somebody the next thing that the person will do is to praise the name of the lord because what i believe love is is that spirit of truth that reigneth in believers so when i see you you have the spirit of truth there is a connection there is a connection between us amen so while we are speaking the next moment we are giving praise to the lord amen amen and amen amen so let's go to job chapter four amen i want to take my time but at the same time i'm looking at time then elias the terminite answered and said if we are said to commune with thee will thou be grieved if if we decide to talk with you we decide to give you advice thou be grieved but who can withhold himself from speaking now behold that has instructed many and that has strengthened the weak hands now he is giving a testimony of job that you see this is the testimony that people are giving and this testimony went straight to heaven amen and even god gave testimony of job he said that was have upholding him that was falling and thou has strengthened the feeble knees so they were saying these good things about job he life us or eliphaz was saying this good thing about job but now it has come upon thee and our faintest it touched thee and that are troubled so if i understand the scripture is saying that when people are weak and they come to your house the testimony is that they get out with joy praising the lord that's a testimony you have job but this time this same thing happens to you and you are feeble the spirit of accusation it's not this that fear thy confidence thy hope and the uprightness of thy waste remember i pray thee whoever perished being innocent now the spirit of accusation starts job who can ever get perished or whoever who can perish when he's innocent or where were the righteous cut off now i'm bringing you to the bible have you seen in the bible that somebody perished that we call a righteous man amen even as i have seen they'd applaud iniquity and so wickedness reaped the same by the blast of god they perish and by the breadth of his nostrils are they consumed he was intellectually inclined with the word of the lord the roaring of the lion and the voice of the fierce lion and the teeth of the young lions are broken all right let's go on the old lion perished for lack of prey and the start lions wells are scattered abroad now a thing was secretly brought to me okay so now he's telling joke that something secretly came to me and my ear received a little thereof a false vision amen in thoughts from the visions of the night when deep sleep fallen on men fear came upon me and trembling which made all my bones to shake so he's trying to tell joke that he he he had a vision and and that vision put fear in him then a spirit passed before my face the air of my flesh stood up it stood still but i could not discern the form thereof an image was before my eyes there was silence and i had a voice saying shall mortal men be more just than god shall a man be more pure than his maker behold all right so that's the question he put to job shall you a man be more pure than your maker but the lord gave testimony of job that he was perfect behold now he went on to behold he put no trust in his servants and his angels he charged with foley how much less in them that dwell in houses of clay now this is the spirit of accusation he said whose foundation is in the dust which are crushed before the moth so he's talking about the fact that even the angels cannot stand before god so how much more you and mortal men but this evening we want to remind elias that in the book of genesis 1 26 and 27 he said let us make man in our own image amen so god already had in his mind to make man equal with him now the spirit of accusation comes and says that you man how can you make yourself god amen now i just want us to look at um something in genesis 36 yes genesis 36 but abraham said something that the book of job was the first book to be written in the bible amen sometimes when the lord does not open your eyes to some of these things you'll be like what is he talking about amen genesis 36 1-4 now these are the generations of esau who is edom eso took his wives of the daughters of canaan ada the daughter of elon the hittites and a holy bomber the daughter of anna the daughter of zebian the hivite and bashmat ishmael's daughter sister of neighborhood another bear to israel elijah's or elephants now we are looking at elephants who came to job and bechama bear rail all right so let's go to um verse 10 to 12. these are the names of israel's sons elephants the son of ada the wife of esau wrote the son of vaishma the wife of israel and the sons of elephants were 10 months now when we read in the book of job chapter four the bible says elephants was a terminate now in eleven we see the connection of elephants in tehran terma was his son so in other words we are tracing elephants to esau we are tracing elephants to israel now we want to look at the spirits in israel let's go to hebrews chapter 12. hebrews chapter 12 let's start from verse 13. he said that make straight paths for your feet let's that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the lord looking diligently lest any man feel of the grace of god lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be developed the root of bitterness defiles men now verse 16 said lest there be any fornicator or profane person as eso who for one muscle of meat sold his birthright so paul is saying that esau is a profane man he's a fornicator why because the root of bitterness came into israel and because of that he lost his birthright now what i believe birthright is is the inheritance of the lord jesus christ so in exodus chapter 3 verse 6 when god was talking to moses he started the god of abraham the god of isaac so after isaac we should expect esau but who got that inheritance jacob so esau missed that inheritance and i believe that that inheritance is the god of jacob that esau missed amen and paul called him a profane man because of the root of bitterness the spirit of jealousy that comes in the people that made them to miss god amen let's go back to her guy 223 our topic for tonight we have responded to your call the signet of humanity haggai 223 now before that i'll read a quote from the prophet the super sign he said oh god if the world could only see that that god and man are one the super sign was that first man that god could come into all that god was he brought into christ and all christ was he poured into the church super sign god and man together that was to be the super sign of the last day when the entire bible was to be fulfilled in the last days a super sign a virgin shall conceive and this conception when it's brought forth will be god manifested in the flesh a super sign they still don't believe it but a worse anyhow it's still a super sign notice super sign they've got superman today they got fictions of superman all these other kind of super things but the church has got a super sign god back in the church manifested in human flesh god united with men his sure super sign amen let's go to haggai 223 so accusation of elaphas or elephants was that can you a man make yourself can you compare yourself to god that was accusation now i read again from the prophet amen show us the father and it will satisfy us he said the prophet is saying job begin to wonder why that man laid down and he didn't rise up so job was was thinking why why would a man die and will not rise up he didn't see him come up in the spring but he seen the flower come up in the spring well then when elihu came to him and began to speak to him he said now look job you are accusing god wrong he said now look that flower has not has not sinked it stands right in the way that god made it and it reproduces itself right back from there to resurrection death to resurrection all right he said now but man sinned and that separated him from god and resurrection so he said but there's coming a just one this is my point but it's coming at just one amen there's coming one who will stand in the bridge for this sinner that will put his hand on a sinful man and a holy god and breached away he said oh my job noticed it he was a prophet satan on the ash heap he got up shook himself he'd been scrapping his voice and he got up and shook himself and said i know my redeemer leave it so sometimes certain companies certain friends certain church members that comes to you they come with a different kind of message that will lift you up from the from the grave amen and who be speaking amen the things of the lord amen and amen now compare these friends those three friends that came to job they made him cast that day he was born but this one the prophet called him a type of christ he came amen and job was caught up in the spirit of resurrection [Laughter] amen amen amen amen brah stephen said in one of his preaching that depending on how you look at god or what connection you have with god what you are requesting with god how you see him whether you you know him to be a god of resurrection or a healer amen that is the manifestation that you are going to see so job was almost i would say that he was dead amen because everything was taken off he was down nothing was going on but a spirit of truth when the spirit of truth cometh it comes in the power of resurrection amen amen let's go back to haggai 2 23. amen in that day said the lord of hosts will i take d o zerubbabel my servant the son of shuttle said the lord and will make thee as a signet for have chosen thee said the lord of hosts now we understand that signet stands for authority so god is saying that you a human being standing right before me when people see you they are looking at the authority of the most high accusation was that how can you compare yourself to god but the lord comes down and says zerubbabel you a human when they see you they'll see the authority of the most high and i understand in this last days that there stood a man and said that key short fitted in my hand i hope you are catching it tonight amen amen so now we look at something from ha guy one verse one something happened in our time and um i just want to talk a little about it amen hagar one verse one he said in the second year of darius the king so let's let's keep it in the second year of darius the king so we know it's in the second year if i could borrow a brother's mark [Laughter] all right in the second year all right so we go to haggai 2 verse 10 haggai chapter 2 verse 10 in the fourth and 20th day of the ninth month so that means the 24th day in the ninth month 24th day in the ninth month so in the second year of kendarius in the ninth month on the 24th day amen so let's go to verse 18. verse 18 chapter 2 verse 18 it says consider now from this day and upward from the 4th and 20th day of the 9th month even from the date that the foundation of the lord's temple was lit consider it the lord is saying let us consider this day back to 23. in that day said the lord of hosts will i pick d o zerubbabel my seventh the son of shithel saith the lord and will make thee as a sickness for i have chosen thee saith the lord of hosts so the lord is saying let us consider consider a day 24th day in the ninth month in the second year of the reign of darius and we see that during the time of darius sudden things happened they wanted to build a temple and then um before darius came a king came and they tried to trouble zerubbabel and and the jews was we're trying to rebuild the temple amen but when darius came he went back to the decree that was already given by king sarios cyrus a man that let this people build this temple unto the lord amen now i'm just typing something we know that israel was back in their homeland or it became a nation in may 1948 is that true all right 1948 so may 1948 to may 1949 is one year now we get to the second year so may one june july august september october november december january we are in the ninth month one two three four five six seven eight nine so when we get to january we are now in which year 1950 24 january 1950 when there was a controversy about the preaching of the seventh messenger they brought the pillar of fire brought him to the pulpit and we know what happened they took the picture the bible said in this day said the lord of hosts will i take d or zerubbabel my seven the son of shithill saith the lord and will make thee as a signet for our chosen bee see the lord of hosts [Music] i don't know if you are connecting something tonight so our message in this day the lord has vindicated that i am calling a bright and this bride is going to be my authority and he vindicated it in the leader of the dispensation according to what he has said in his own word steven was preaching last time he said zerubbabel typed the prophet but the prophet does not move alone he moves with the high priest so zerubbabel was moving with a high priest now we have in january 24 1950 a type of zerubbabel standing and the high priest coming down to vindicate that this is my authority in this last days and the prophet said that the hope is that the picture was not taken because of me he said the picture was taken because of you and i so that we can know who we have amen amen thank you lord jesus the segment of humanity amen now we saw in the book of job that satan went to god he went to god and moved god against his own servant now god is saying to us in this last days that i have called you as my authority now if satan who is the enemy of god goes to god and move him against his perfect one how much more you and i that he said you are my authority amen amen amen we bless the name of the lord i want to take a reading from the prophet without a prophet we have no message amen without the prophet we have no message in fact i was blessed with that mystery of sea of glass amen amen we have a sea of glass amen that is manifesting one two three four five six seven when the soviet sea was opened amen that was harsh in heaven and we came to realize that when the servant angel came the lord said i have nothing for you when he came to his time he said i have nothing for you amen so the question is so what is my message he said the message is already with you so in the seventh message it's a combination of one two three four five six in actual fact the seven message is one and all right so that is why you will find people ministers who try to preach their message and they are preaching just message one they are preaching message two they are preaching message three why because it is a total of all these messages that is put in the seventh message amen amen so um i was so blessed amen i was so blessed without preaching i want to read something here the prophet said show us the father and it suffices it's about notice when a man is hungering and thirsting for god god will draw nigh to the man always see he said give up surrender your will to god so then when his church members came he's talking about job now when his church members came and could not console him accuse him to being a secret sinner said he is sin before god job knew he had not seen and he knew he was all right but then god sent a young man down by the name of elihu came down to me job perfect type of christ again he didn't accuse job of being a secret sinner he tried to tell him of someone who could come and stand in the bridge in the last days to put his hands upon a sinful man and upon the holy god and breach the way we have that same god that has vindicated his message in this last days breaching the gap between sinful man and the holy god so that we can stand before god without authority amen amen i believe i'm speaking to somebody tonight amen amen without this prophet message we have no message amen now i'm reading from zechariah chapter 14 6 7. amen and amen when brad steven called me he said we want to listen to your channel amen so this is a new channel amen [Laughter] this is a new channel we have to get used to it amen amen zechariah 14 6 and 7 and it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not be cleared nor dark but it shall be one day we shall be known to the lord not day nor night the spirit of laodicea it is not there it is not night the lukewarm spirit but he said but it shall come to pass that at the evening time it shall be light we've been promised that in this day that light of the maker will come back to breach the sinful man with the holy god amen amen and that is a promise to you and i tonight and he said we have responded to your call the sickness of humanity amen amen now let's look at something when those three friends of job came to him they didn't eat right they sat with him for seven days they didn't eat but in the book of genesis 18 we see a difference that three people came to this same prophet the type of a prophet and what did he do he came to eat so it means that our promise in this last day when we still have three people coming to a generation of darkness a generation that is dead he comes with food amen amen he comes with an open book amen amen it is an open book that is full to the bride my wife was like when we came back from um the meetings i don't feel like eating because i've been filled amen and that's the kind of fruit that the lord has brought to us in this last days to feast with a king amen and amen it is not coming to to to to fast to to to to grieve our spirit so that we start cursing the dead that we were born we start casting the time that we sinned or we started kissing when we were in the world but when he came to us he came with an open book that we should say oh lord we are justified thank you lord jesus amen amen amen we bless the name of the lord we just want to close with this i know i'm not talking ah i don't want to take your time man amen and amen proverbs chapter 4 proverbs 4. proverbs chapter 4 hallelujah proverbs 4 10-22 he said hear o my son and receive my sayings and the years of their life shall be many i have taught thee in the way of wisdom in fact we have the spirit of wisdom in this church that the lord is using to teach us he said i have thought thee in the way of wisdom i have led thee in right paths when thou growers thy steps shall not be straightened and when they are runnest that shall not stumble take fast hold of instruction let her not go keep her for she eats their life enter not into the part of the wicked and go not in the way of evil men enter not into the part of those friends that came to job said avoid it pass not by it turn from it and pass away for this for the sleep not except they have done mischief and their sleep is taken away unless they cross some to fall for they eat the bread of wickedness and drink their wine of violence but they're part of the just is as the shining light that shineth more and more onto the perfect day the part of the just is a shining light that shineth more and more it is a revelation of a revelation upon revelation until we get onto that perfect day amen so the way of the wicked is as darkness they know not at what they stumble they know not what they are talking about they stumble at it they don't know what they're talking about my son attend to my words incline their ear unto my saints let them not depart from their eyes keep them in the midst of thine heart for their life unto those that find them and health to their flesh god add his blessings to this world amen and amen amen amen amen amen amen [Applause] amen [Applause] amen god richly bless you amen [Applause] he did well for the first time amen blessed be the name of the lord the three friends of job that came first they were like they were helping job and before that they begin to complain and bringing even a false vision and accusing job not even knowing what is going on amen but thank god we have illahu he comes always a little bit toward the end amen and brother brother i'm saying was a type of coup the top of christ amen and i love this scripture that he finished with in genesis chapter 4 in proverbs chapter 4 verse 18 he said but the path of the just is as the shining light that shattereth more and more onto the perfect day in other words it's a revelation that keeps unfolding unfolding unfolding until the perfect day when this body is going to be changed and will be translated from mortal to immortality and for those that was under corruption to incorruption in other words we have we have been changed as we're looking at that image we have been changed from glory to glory from light to light to life before you know it one of this day we will feel the change coming up amen blessed be the name of the lord we have received a message amen and that message is certain hallelujah i was uh i mentioned even something probably i was talking to my wife and i mentioned that in ohio i say the devil what he did to eve he belittled his weapon amen he just took his weapon and belittled him until you take your weapon and put it down amen god told him not to do it that was the best weapon ever but the devil showed him that that was the wrong one he should use a different one amen there is no way you can switch or flip this message if you flip it you do because there is nothing that can withstand the forces of laudisha but the message of brother branham amen if somebody depart from it just watch their life you're going to see what is happening it is telling you that the restraint has been taken off before you know it back to paint back to high heel back to this back to this there's no restraint because they have left the weapon amen it is our protection which is the message of brother branham amen i'm going to read the maid one of the court then we will call brad kelem it's on the message uh it's in the message for him will i accept in 1952 on july 18th paragraph 19 what about i'm saying that is praying one for the other the value of prayer now this counselor talking about the three friends he said this counselor that had come down and said before job that is the oldest book in the bible the book of job is the oldest book in the bible and brother branham said joe believed along the time of nimrod and back in there somewhere down from seth to adam amen so the genealogy of job goes all the way to the time of nimrod amen so the early phase that was in the book of esau that one came later but job was way before that amen but blessed be the name of the lord we got a message and you need to have good friends friend that can come to you and lift you up not friend that come to you and put you down and bring you down like okay this is what we told you how can you sit seven days with somebody pretending that you're feeling them and then before you know it you begin to condemn them like have you seen anybody suffering like you and not being uh having not done something wrong toward god that is not the case you were not even it was even better for you to stay brother branham say when you go visit somebody who's sick do not tell him how bad he is you need that coach you tell me you ask me brother brandon say when you go visit somebody who's sick or somebody who's going through a trial don't even mention that amen talk about the things that can lift that person up because from one company he can curse the day that he was born but when another company come then he begin to see the resurrection so when somebody is down you need to find someone who can lift you up amen i thought i was preaching in ohio i say and i mentioned something i say if you notice jesus they hire people to tell lies on him and the high priest inquired him to respond according to the lies and the bible says jesus never spoke anything in other words when what the people are accusing you is not the truth you don't have to answer anything you don't have to post stuff on facebook because sometimes people post stuff on facebook and you can tell they are in war with someone you don't have to post stuff on facebook like the lord is the one seeing that no you don't have to do that all i'm caring is my god knows what is truth i have seen people doing things one one thing today and they repent after three years amen and the bible say carefully ask him do you respond to this jesus was quiet because i don't have to pay attention to that but when the high priest asked him are you the king of the jews then jesus opened his mouth now you asking me about the things that belongs to me now i can talk to you amen in other words you don't have to be answering to people on things that are false you false accusing you just leave it alone remember take god place god between you and them and keep on your road and keep moving you don't have to answer them on instagram on facebook on whatsapp leave them alone you wasting your time amen paul one day was uh had a shipwreck in the island of uh what is the name again brother robert malta yes now a prophet vindicated like paul have a shipwreck what are you gonna say maybe paul did something wrong in his life but god already gave him a revelation that the sheep will wreck but nobody will die you didn't have that portion of the revelation all you saw is something happened to them an accident happened to them you don't know even the interpretation of the accident amen and what happened paul came out was going to get the wood to warm up what happened a snake bit him the bible says the people look and they say voila that's it so even though he got spare over there still his sin is following him this one could be a higher order of a murderer that's why he must die and everybody was waiting to see him boom then they say you see he always pay back but paul knowing that they told him he must compare before caesar and he knew that the accusation was false the jews were moved by envy he just took that mamba that snake that snake from facebook that snake that is beating you from instagram just shake it up put it in a fire and what did he do he never even stopped to watch that snake being cooked in the fire he turned around and continued doing what he was doing it was the people that changed their testimony after watching paul for a while they say how did he survive destroyer because he told me when i go through the water it's not gonna submerge me when i go to fire it's not gonna burn me regardless of what is coming on my way i'm gonna make it all the way all the way i am going all the way i will see you until the day of my redemption amen there is nothing that's going to stop me nothing nothing nothing you gotta know what is going on amen i gave a testimony we were looking for a luggage to carry to ohio amen we were looking for one and we only have one we traveled with that for maybe two three years and he had a lock with a combination we forgot the combination my wife forgot it her sister forgot it nobody remember we tried for years trying to open that log try this one change this one this all the password it's not working we left it alone now we got to go to ohio should i go buy a new one and my wife said try one two three before i even go there she gave me the code she said try this this this i just took the cone put it guess what happened guess what happened it opened after two or three years it opened and she told me she said a voice gave me that code now when that happened before i go to ohio do you think there is a devil that can stand on my way it is telling me when the ways of a man pleases the lord he open everything hallelujah when i was landing in ohio i was fine bring that devil amen we let us finish preaching get out stand there we were supposed to fellowship for one hour ago just standing in the church the one hour was gone i said brother i cannot go eat we need to go straight to the airport we got to the airport only one hour the plane is going to go we got there walking quickly we say i don't want to miss this plane when i get there somebody over there somebody over there somebody over there and those people very slow and the plan is about to stop boarding i
