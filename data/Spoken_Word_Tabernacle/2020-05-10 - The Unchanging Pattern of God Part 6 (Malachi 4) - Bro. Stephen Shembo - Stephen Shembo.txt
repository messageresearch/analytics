seems more relevant to me to me seems more we need to hope we'll do this the heart of our husband does safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of support she will do them good and not equal all the days in her life she's seeking all of it blacks and working willingly with her hands she is like the merchant ships she bringeth her food from afar she Rises also while it is yet night and giveth me to her household and of course into her maidens she considered the field and buying it with the fruit of her hand she planted the fingers she girded her loins with strength and strengthening her arms she perceiveth that her merchandise is good her candles goeth not out by night she lay up her hands to the spindle and her hands hold the distance she stretched without her hand to the poor yay she reached forth her hands to the meeting she is not afraid to smell it for her household for all of her household are clothed with scarves she maketh herself coverings of tapestries her clothing is silk and purple her husband is known in the gates when he sitteth among the Elders of the land she magnify linen and celibate and delivereth girls into the merchant strength and honor of her clothing and she shall rejoice in time to come she opened her mouth with wisdom and in her tongue is the law of kindness she looked well to the ways of her household and he is not the bread of idleness her children arise up and call her blessed her husband also and he Praises her many daughters have done virtuously without his sellers than all favor is deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman that fears the Lord she shall be praised give her the fruit of her hands and let her own words praise her in the gates amen I found that little Point here yesterday I'm thinking about this this

not to come up and pray with these um obviously last week we had a prayer request for sister Melanie Wallace and she texted me I think it was late yesterday evening that she's still not feeling well in her body so brother Brian up you know he uh text me a lot and I said I won't have to stay home and take care of my wife so let's remember her again um somebody else texted me and I don't have everybody's phone number so I'm not sure who it was but they were um first of all they were saying how much if they're if their mother-in-law was enjoying the services on the on the uh YouTube so um that's great I mean that's what you know we didn't think we would get out like that we wouldn't do it so you know so I'm glad it's reaching people and that you know it's encouraging they're very good Services it's a very good preaching we haven't heard this in a long time and uh and we really need it um so they request at the same time was to remember the saints that spoke with more tarantic we haven't seen each other for a while now while we were waiting for president Thomas Lewis he mentioned something about May 17th about them possibly being able to gather again so maybe we'll check into it and see it and he did encourage you know he said we're still going to be extremely if you're not comfortable don't come stay at home you know so we'll I don't know what our plan is so let's let's um pray about that I think that's what two weeks one week two weeks one week I'm ready I'm ready we need our fellowships we draw strength from each other so let's remember that and then I did see some pictures of brother Jewel long enough online and he's doing very well he was going to a doctor's appointment they were riding in the car but he's also he's standing outside waiting and he took a bunch of family photos with uh Sabrina you know and sister Tasha and the grandkids and everything so they say he's still got a little ways to go so let's keep praying for him and he they said they used to work boots Advantage he needs a boost of energy so obviously he's he's still weak in his body so let's ask for some God is trying to do his body because the kingdom needs him still right he's still here and there's a reason for that and then lastly we did receive the text concerning brother Laurel Henry and sister Cheryl Hansen's dad remember the team used to call him Big Brother you know he lost his wife several years ago and his health hasn't been the greatest in them apparently this week it's been declining even more so they ask us to remember him his name is Lowell Henry please you know he's a wonderful brother he believed the message so let's stop let's just keep getting prayer this week and it's as well the family those are big families you know Sister Cheryl has a twin sister

praise God is it working system okay let's go straight to the scripture we thank God for another opportunity to gather together here the devil has been fighting this message and right and left but we believe by the grace of God that something will be done here it's going to be the Book of Luke we're still working on it is it working says if not you might have to restart it Luke chapter 18. verse 8. we read this last time and probably we're going to read one thing and then lead to the city if your computer can get worried I can give you a USB that you can post from Luke chapter 18 verse 8. if you dare you can say Amen the bible say that I will I tell you that he will avenge them speedly talking about elect if you look at verse seven it's speaking about the elect nevertheless when the son of man comes we explained this last week that it is the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ already came he is preaching and he is also prophesying about his second gun he said when the son of man come shall he find faith on Earth the concern is at the second coming of the Lord Jesus is worrying whether he's going to find faith on Earth so the problem is Faith on earth and the coming of the Lord let's go to Second Thessalonians chapter 2. thank you the last time we saw her Jude also spoke about that faith and Jude say that he was urging the believer to contend for that faith that was once delivered to the Saints right which was showing that that Faith later on he's gonna get in trouble second Thessalonians chapter two if you dare you can say amen amen thank you good yes now we beseech you Brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ again it's speaking about the second coming of the lord we find Jesus Christ prophesying about the second coming we're in Nevada faith and now Paul is also prophesying about the second coming of the Lord but Paul is also going to tell us something here he said now we beseech you Brethren by the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together to him it is a gathering into someone we might probably preach on that later on and see where is that gallery and by our gathering together to him that you be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled why because something is going to come up to shake you something is going to come up to trouble you he said neither by Spirit nor by word nor by letter as promise as that the day of Christ is a hand let no man deceive you by any means for that day now it's Paul who's prophesying about the future he said now that day shall not come except they come in Falling Away first you might be seated as we continue so first of all Jesus is prophesying about his second coming and as he's prophesying about his second coming he is worrying about whether he's going to find Faith are we going to find faith on earth when he comes it's already telling us that something is going to happen to that Faith then we found you the last time he told us about contending for that faith if you want to fight you want to contend for that Faith it's also talking to us that you are something is going to be attacking that Faith it's going to be slide uh 34 by David slide 34 if you can get it yeah now John Paul is now prophesied he said let no man deceive you for that day shall not come except they come a falling away first and falling away from what so something must be established first in the church but Paul is saying that down the road they're gonna come and falling away so something is Gonna Come that's gonna shake the church away from the word of God there will be people living the faith going into somewhere so that's why we're trying to see why do we need an Elijah why do we need a restoration Ministry why do we need a Malachi for Ministry if you need that Malachi for the restoration Ministry something need to be probably first moved away once it's moved away then we can restore it yes my brother that's 34. yeah it's supposed to be praise God okay The Devil Is Alive now that I've got it he started by getting brother Brian and his wife then we move on with the computer so something is going to be saying this morning he said that Falling Away first and that man of sin be revealed the Son of Perdition so somebody there is a man of sin that's gonna get into the church and that man is going to attack faith and he will deviate Faith then later on we needed somebody to restore that Faith back we will see that man of sin because getting into the man of sin is preaching the seals now let's go to our last scripture which is first Timothy verse 4. chapter 4 verse 1 and 2 then we go from there First Timothy chapter four verse 1 and 2. please keep your Bible because we are not in the Zodiac we are not in the pyramid we are now in the written word amen so you need to have your Bible I need to vaccinate here pretty good and make sure we are really really really vaccinated yes yes so when somebody comes you don't talk much you say take your bubble and disprove me Malachi foreign town now Paul again is prophesying that in the latter time Jude spoke about the problem we Faith Jesus spoke about the same thing Paul said there will come and falling away first before Jesus Christ come before the second coming of the Lord there will be a falling away that's what Paul is talking to us here now in this episode here Paul is giving us more more more warning about it he said in the last time in the latter days in the anthem okay in the exam some shall depart from Jesus so now we understand why we need a larger somebody will leave faith someone will depart from the faith giving him to seducing spirit and doctrines of devil speaking lies in her prophecy I can dig into this pretty deep once someone leaves the word of God this is the spirit that is picking up this he says speaking lies in hypocrisy having their conscious sealed with their hearts iron in other words their heart their soul doesn't have any moral condemnation they can do something wrong and they're still good they are called Blind killers they can kill without a remorse someone will leave the faith there won't be a following way should I find faith we must contend for the faith that's why we need a Ministry to pull the church back again to Faith let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy father in this Mother's Day Lord Lord we want to thank you for all our sisters all the mothers Lord father especially those of spoken word Tabernacle and even those Lord father following us online Lord father May a special blessing to be granted unto them Lord father there is no greater gift to your Prophet others than the gift of wisdom Lord father you spoke in your word through Solomon that a wise woman can do you will build your household and he also spoke to us through Apostle Paul but you trust you are the wisdom of God May Lord father this end time message Lord be quick and Lord father in a supernatural way different than before to our sisters Lord so Lord father that wisdom Lord that you have unfolded by sending this message Lord be impregnated the Lord father in your soul lord so that they might be the big faithful gospel Lord of this Center manifesting Jesus Christ the same yesterday today forever father I commit myself unto their hand moving myself Lord farther away from this place May the Holy Spirit May the inside teacher may you come down and teach us your word to your children Lord in the name of Jesus Christ be the Alpha and the Omega remove all hindrance father in Jesus gracious name amen God bless you you've already been seen now we started this series and we are on part six of Malachi for the unchanging pardon of God when we say God doesn't change meaning if God does something if you look clearly of what God did the first time you can follow God through and you will see that he's still the same yesterday today and forever because we are talking about Malachi 4 we are talking about the spirit of Alaska so before we even get into Malachi for before you even get into the ministry of our time today you need to make sure you go back first and see what did God do with the man Elijah once you understand the working of the spirit of God into Elijah over there then we can come back in our town and see exactly compare trust or watch Christ through his characteristic and making sure that he is still the same yesterday today and forever if he's still not the same then there is no way we can follow him when we started last week we found out that we spoke about Moses because Jesus passed when he was going with the disciple on the road of his mind when he began to talk to them he spoke he started from Moses and we found that Moses was a very critical point because Moses was the one that brought the law the Bible said that the law came by Moses but Grace and Truth came from Jesus Christ that is in the Book of John chapter 1 verse 17 if Allah so we found that Moses first established Israel or distinguished Israel separately from any other nation in other words when you look at the Jews the lifestyle the way they behave the way they dress the way they are living the way they operate it looks different than any other tribe or any other Nation on the earth and the reason why it happened because God sent the Prophet by the name of Moses and Moses established the dispossession of the Lord but we found out that before Moses died that Moses prophesy about Jesus Christ he prophesied about the first coming of Jesus Christ in Deuteronomy 18 verse 18. Jesus says that the Lord God will send a prophet light unto me so Moses was already prophesying about the coming Messiah then we found out that not only did Moses prophesy about the oncoming Messiah but Moses also prophesied about the falling away of Israel last Sunday we found out that he called the elders the elders the elders the Elders of the tribe and he spoke to them and he said I know that when I'm gonna die when I'm gonna be the party I know that you Israel will depart completely from the faith then we found out that when Moses died Israel entered into the Promised Land once Israel entered into the promised land something happened they went through the judges they went to the Kings until they reached the time of King and on the time of King Ahab brother Branham said that was the darkest age of Israel in other words it was the time when Israel which drifted completely away from God because they have a king and that King was Ahab and the Bible said he was the worst king of all of them so since Israel departed completely from God departed completely from the law of Moses departed completely from the original Foundation that was placed by Moses God sent a special Ministry by the name of Elijah so when Elijah came in we found last week that there was four things that happened to Elijah number one Elijah found in Israel into a state that they were hunting between two opinion and we found out that that state is a very bad State because there are men that is a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways so Isabel worked so hard into Israel until she reached a point where she put Israel between two opinions right yes and between two opinions brother says this in the message come and see Val Branham was talking to someone on a prayer line he said how do you do you believe before your heart you do you're in trouble you are not sick only you are nervous I'm going Elementary everybody there you are upset this person is nervous this person is upset why is he upset we are coming to the great physician not that brother brother means the great physician but the one that brought the brother was waiting for he's the great physician he was the one that was able to detect the disease that's why brother Branham saying I'm talking to you I'm just waiting for him what's he coming very brother said I take every Spirit here and the control he said you are not sick only you are nervous you are upset it's a mental distress like random continue because you are hunting between two opinions what you must do in life you are not yours is not a sickness so hunting between two opinion can cause you a mental distress hurting between two opinion can put you in the state of nervousness and brother Branham continue in spiritual and measure he said another thing that another thing that cause it among the people that was his Amnesia he said he's getting between two opinions that shall cause amnesia and it gets you to a place where you actually what you have done you have lost your reasons so Israel between two opinions put them into a mental state of nervousness and not only that Israel lost the reason you have lost your mind you can make you don't know who you are that's why your message have come to come to identify Who You Are you can identify yourself you can walk around eat and everything but you still can't identify yourself that is what the lukewarm condition does you can still be living you can still be talking you can still be going to work and doing everything but still you lost your man you are acting a different way you are unstable in everything that you did so when Elijah met them there is something that Elijah talked to them that last week I didn't even talked about it but the Lord spoke to me that last night so I have to show it to you let's go to the book of first king chapter 18 Again he showed to me so there is no way I can let it go he came last evening that's nice first king chapter 18 if you dare you can say Amen verse 30 and Elijah said to all the people what did he say come near to me that was what the Lord quickened to me last time last night come near to me Amen in other words Israel was not near to Elijah I'm going slowly Israel was away from the prophet but before the restoration start God told Israel you come first closer to the prophet you need to leave the other camp yes sir you need to live the other place you need to move away from where you are and come on this side you cannot be understandable and follow the prophet he said come first near to me amen come first in this camp why is it important to come first to Elijah you just keep your finger running as I'm going through what the Lord shared with me last night let's take the Book of Ruth comes after the judges and you can look in the car and bring the water the keys are in my bed if you dare you can say amen The Book of Ruth chapter two Let Me Now go to the field and bring ear of corn after him in whose sight I shall find what I shall find Grace okay it's a message of Grace and she said to her go my daughter and she went and came and dreamed in the field after the Reapers and her heart was in other words it happened everybody there he happened to light on a part of the field belonging to God who was the Kindred to a million eliminate in other words Naomi God would go and Google there were many things over there we didn't know which one but we know that the footsteps of the righteous are order of the Lord so why the rule to begin to go somehow the Lord took the footsteps of wood and directed her to powers and it happened that Boaz was a king blood took Emily Malik who was the father-in-law true this didn't happen by any chance observative verse 10 then said boys to his servant that was sent over the Reapers so boys have the reverse but there was one servant that was above the rivers he was the messenger and then on the dumb messenger there were other preachers I'm going slowly amen this servant that was set over the Reapers whose themsel is this and they explained to her then verse 8 then send boss to root hear you not my daughter God not green in another field [Music] are you there it is very important for you to stand in the field of boys can give you food because the law says when you are Weeping make sure when something falls down don't pick it up because there is people there that are poor they need to come and clean that so the law the scripture provided already for the poor for the lady for the people that are in distress so any field in Israel can provide food anything in Israel can give you something to sustain you but not every field can provide Redemption and remain a more abide and remain a stranger and remain single yes but they only feel that could not only sustain good and give her food but also change the statue transform the status of Ruth was the field of doors because the field of powers is a film that is connected with bloodline where are you are you there that's why Ballers look at Harry and boys say I know you don't know the mystery I am dead King's Men Redeemer you don't understand me better but let me just give you an advice when you need food steady don't go off with it if you go to the Methodist they can give you something if you go to the Baptist they can provide you with your necessary need God for you to have Redemption you cannot get Redemption any kind of way up that's why you see people in denomination they are praying God is blessing them they give their dad God is blessing them because that is based on the scriptures they can break bread they get a promotion they pray pray and you meet them they can give you testimony God did this to me God did this to me God healed my baby God did this to me that's good but reduction you must be honestly the devil is fighting my voice man are you there first he said then he said for us to move bring you not my daughter go not to Green in another field neither God from here but a bad here fast by what by my bed stand with the other women stay close to the enemy women stay close to the churches that are in the field of powers because the woman in the Bible speaks of a church let's continue verse 9 let your eyes be on the field that they do with them and God you are today have I not charged the young man that it should not touch you so there is a restriction for preachers

master of bread all the same God that the people are preaching the same message that we press are drawing you have the right to listen to the sad message it's not a message for preaching different than a message for the lighting that Catholicism [Music] and she sat beside the river and he reached her particle courage boys she said say can you move over there she's still scared she said that boys look uh you Pokemon take it look look the minister looking at her she's eating boys Rich again take I am trying to make you understand something watch it and what what suffice in other words she ate until she was full [Music] maybe people look maybe the other men can scan they say huh look at the way she's sitting at the table she want me to come to them she's eating too much that's not your problem said in Psalm 23 that in front of my enemy God put up a devil God will bless you in front of those that hate you if God bless me so much the people will be jealous that's not your problem that's not your problem stay where God put you if he bless you that your God it will bless you just take it and enjoy you finish take something to drink you finish thank you everybody there this came last night amen and one surface and what and when she was with enough to believe God has commanded the preacher the amen saying let the air clean even among the Sheep there is no restriction go ahead and put your hand there this woman is a stranger we are the woman of Israel we are here we were born in the message we grew up in the message but this one only came today and look at the way you are treating her foreign awesome breakfast for her you're not the one intentionally blessing wait to see her coming get something drunk after life you were just dropping back it is not the reaper dropping it is Bowers through the we passed taking care of the Bride anything whatever God give giving to the children no no no no no if I pray for him he's gonna be blessed more pray for them bless them it is not your blessing yeah Jesus broke the bread gave it to the disciple to give it to the people you are just a passage and let for some of the handful of for purpose and leave them that she may greet them and rebuke her enough now this is where I'm going watch now now on first coin and Naomi said to her daughter below now put this back Naomi said to her daughter blessed be the Lord who has not left his kingdom his uh left his kindness to the living and to the dead and the Army said to her the man is near of skin to us one of our next Kingsmen when borrowers met root God was never explained this true he just show action he only saw works are you there yes sir but when the wolf went back to Naomi Naomi look at those he said why did you work ah I worked for today I'm so good I was so blessed today now let me look he said let me ask you a question I understand you fool you good you happy you are blessed no problem which film Hallelujah which church which film did you go do is your character to bring home blessings it is okay to have Prosperity it is okay to have a good job but which film did you go give me good it's a man I saw him that man for some reason did me so much favor what is his name his name is boys Andrew and now he said that man has that connection to me but what truth there are founded help a revelation but she's still caught up into something else [Music] watch verse 21 and wrote the more about the same he said to me also you give fast by my young men until they have ended the Harvest they are giving her the key to the Revelation but she is long caught up into the gift yes sir right yes she looks more on the gift of the spirit but it's not always telling her that God Giver of the gift of the spirit is connected to you right but she's now caught up oh I'm speaking in God oh I met the angel of the Lord I saw this before but the Lord has blessed me Naomi said listen to me that man is connected to you oh yes I know but you know he told me stay with the amen stay with them now only look he said no problem since you don't understand that Revelation yet I'm gonna let you do what he told you to do what now me on verse 21 on verse 22 and I always said to roof head though they love it is good my love that you go out with them in other words Naomi left that subject it's not ready for that year she doesn't understand it yet she's still caught up into churches in a message she still caught up about the preacher she's still talking about the young man and the Mendes now he taught me to be with the mothers he taught me to be with the young man he taught me to be with the preacher and that creature so and so I like this one over there according to this message church I'm going to this message saying Naomi said no problem saying the message stay in the churches of the message Continue to follow preachers and later on I will afford you something everyone there amen he says he is my daughter that you go out with his mothers stay with the churches over there that they make you not in the united field don't go to the Baptist don't go to the Methodist stand there and so she came first by what they made it of whom boys so she goes to church she come back she goes to church she comes back she goes to church she comes back she goes to church she comes back she is still standing with God to judge then I only stop and say hey enough you will play church too much you have been after a preacher too much this is the second stage of your life this is the second stage of spoken words available you grew up in the message you've been in the message for 10 years for 20 years but there is a different world a higher call because staying with the hell man staying with demands will continue to leave you in your state are you there every time you come you imagine every time you come you imagine yes are you there but this field is not like any other field this field has a revelation higher than another field that One Direction is the name of the day is not just the one to give you the gift but that man can give you something else let's go to verse chapter 33. thank you they know her mother-in-law said to her my daughter shall I not seek restful I thought everything was good she goes they give her favor they give her bodies they give her stimulus check they give her all kinds of stuff she's so happy prince I'll do why do you worry about it but Naomi was not arrested of the Lord but I'm still not good that I may be well with you that he may be well with you and now is not what does of our history to the resurrection like the first time I told you you will not miss me but since you grow up here with me you got used to the custom of God you know where Paul was taking shower you know where you sleep you know how his field is you know the name of all his Reapers we pursue himself we pursue himself we pursue and so Pastor so and so Pastor so and so Pastor so and so you know demanded this church over there so is acquainted to that but come back again you remember me telling you that that man is a near Kingsman yes sir now change yourself anoint yourself what's your number three wash yourself I want you change completely are you there now you go out to that man and watch where he's laying and go there and sleep at the feet because going to church staying with the mothers following the preachers is good but it's not going to change you are a young woman you need a husband you need to get into a union with boys to a wife are you there is the message that we are now we are not here to go after preaching we are not here to be just in another message it is a term to unite the roof and Powers together once Ruth get married to boys automatically when roof comes back she is not amended anymore she is the first lady she is the boss lady when she helped her she's not breathing after preacher anymore it is the preacher taking care of her [Music] amen are you there that's why it is important to stay in the field of boys number one happy between topping number two step closer to Elijah because when you stand closer to Elijah there is a Redemption connected to the ministry of Elijah then after that Elijah rebuilt the altar we spoke about rebuilding the altar what is an altar in the Bible but Barnum says that we are not come together to talk about the message we already talked about it we're not here to go after the meeting to go after the weakness we come together to get in the message into boys and the message is the word yes that's right we are to get into it get business yes sir that's what we are supposed to do foreign he said they were not just come together to talk about the message you said in the message you begin to glean after the Reapers after a while you sit with the maiden and you begin to talk you know in that church so and so you know so and so you know this says so yeah brother spoke about this spoke about it we didn't come in the message for that they want to get into the message into it gets under the ground do not come say you know Moses told us God of random said brother Brian I'm saying the messenger he said the prophet said he told us that we should have blood what do you think about it boys that was nothing God get the lamb killed amen and get the blood out there we can come and sit and agree with the word the message and everything but don't have that token nothing there is nothing that proves to have you are the wife of boys [Music] what God does he do no good get benefit he was not responsible for everyone out from under the blood but the problem said here that can build the doctor and not to Israel a place of worship down here he said here is an altar I got a truth that is what a church is a what it drives us from a larger Festival has to remove you from the state of being between two opinion either you are for the message or against the person you against the message leave you are for the message say number two come closer to Elijah come in the care of it Hallelujah and once you come in the camp of Elijah that Elijah beginning to rebuild to the author he begins to take the stone but when I'm saying he was denomination that broke those storms denomination came from Jezebel Jezebel brought the fellowship and then he takes the church and begin to rebuild the church back again once Elijah rebuild the church the Bible said he set the wood in order what is wood what about them said wound in the scripture represent Humanity which speaks of the church the wound in order the church in order that's why if Elijah has to come in this Center he must preach Cayton yes are you there because Elijah puts the wood in order are you there so if we want to find the right in our town we must find the man who preached childhood [Music] Elijah took the Bullock and put it upon the wound and cut the Bullock in one pieces Spider-Man have said that Bullock represented Christ amen and brother said the blood of the bullet came under the storm showing that the church must be protected by the blood but the blood was coming from a bleeding Bullock a bleeding word a bleeding message because the message is the one that has the blood that's why come closer to Elijah Amen in the Church of Elijah in the camp of Elijah they alter is rebuilt yes the church is rebuilt in the camp of Elijah there is church order in the camp of Elijah there is a blood of providing a sacrifice on the object and if you notice Brother John the Bible said Elijah was the one who cut do you want to read it or you're good he said he knows Elijah who cut the sacrifice in business what does he mean Paul spoke to Timothy he said you must Show Yourself by the rabbit a good servant rightfully dividing the word are you there in the church the altar after there is rude there is a sacrifice amen are you there but this sacrifice must be kept by Elijah [Applause] are you there you're sacrifice must be separated rightly divided by Elijah Church camp we must find the sermon the preaching that was preached by Elijah you cannot come to this church and preach to us any kind of message amen are you there you must preach to us the sacrifice the millions that was passed by Elijah and the message that was gradually divided by a letter because God's message has blood and their blood that's gonna protected the altar the church amen I'm reading that from the Bible are you there yes I'm just right in the beginning when he poured that you see what happened what came last night well if you want that he taught them doing water [Music] do you want a seed let's go to first king chapter 18. 16 chapter 18. you must stay in the camp this is what came to me last night stay closer to see by the word by two measuring that proportion and he put the wound in what in order your church order foreign are you there and got the pieces that the Bullock increases and then you don't know what the word the message that has been preached was laid upon Church order the church has to come back in order when you prophesy there must be somebody uh doing this they must be that all they have people preach in the church are you there and he said and said feel what sacrifice and on the wood and he said do it there and he gave them and they give him the second time and then and he said do it there and they give you the third time and the Lord they did what there was four brothers four parents of one and they did it how many times four times three equal how many drugs were they how many stores Elijah put together so he said take four there us and put it 12 times there was about three times there were three outpouring are you there and the world is sunk and what they would write the sacrifice makes with the blood wet the storm and fill all over the trench brother said he did that to show that he was genuine there was no fire under it foreign they remove doubt they removed that Brother John but to remove doubt index doing our calling of the water when brother Brahman will show you that the name of God Ibraham was waiting on seven Hallelujah do you remember there were three pigs [Music] how can you take one and poor because when Moses was going to Egypt Moses said they won't believe it God said no problem I'm gonna give you and run around again you say eyes I gave Moses the son I'm also giving you this heart I don't really know how can you get something that is wet and put fire under it because things need to be dry for the fire to work but with Elijah you must put things right for the fire to work in other words when the larger comes back he needs to also preach as brother Robin paradox amen it's coming from your Bible I tell you to preach paradox are you there then we started on Paul everybody clear why do you choose God wow number one we have three dispensations amen we have the dispossession of the lord we started by Moses and we have the dispensation of Grace that came by Jesus Christ amen by Jesus died and goes amen and he left the church who carried that dispensation Hallelujah we have Moses here who carried that disposition until the coming of course the first come Elijah came here as an example as a demonstration because before Christ came another Elijah is there I'm gonna get today are you there yes it's a reference here look back to the reference if Elijah comes back again looks back to the reference if Elijah come back again looked back to the reference are you there so he was like a guinea pig are you there an example to test and to see how that Ministry work then this man said this was the Lord now we are dealing with Grace but with Grace Jesus goes until the second coming but on the second coming here we see someone by the name of Paul why Paul amen amen put your kids let's go straight with God I'm sorry if I'm going slowly I'm not trying to take too many service but I need to log this if even if it takes 20 don't worry yeah we don't want you to sit again and wonder why you believe this message and then somebody will come and send you to a crazy website or something and you come up there like you don't even know your Bible have you noticed that my voice was already here yes yes okay praise God it's supposed to be written by whom simple the greatest Bible it's positive I guess the word you have ever had outside of their lord Jesus Christ power was separated there he wanted to say that I don't know it's the wrong one now Paul was a real God for what so according to brother Brahman Paul is a teacher we all know about the scripture that Paul was an apostle Apostle means a missionary somebody who is said just like John was an apostle Pig there was an apostle but tell him he was an apostle Apostle means somebody who is said no problem now let's come to the second if you need more I have it Hebrew again chapter one this is verse in regard to 34. now Paul was such a Bible what because teacher because he was taught under that great all-time famous okay Paul is a teacher no problem let's stand back now to write to chapter 12 in just a minute amen act 20. see Paul do you believe Powers here Prophet yeah amen Amen brother Branham saying Paul is a prophet while Ibraham said Paul was a teacher where is it in the Bible that Paul is a teacher why is it in the Bible that Paul is the prophet show me a quote show me a scripture so Paul Brothers there is no scripture where Paul is a teacher they always say Paul the Apostle Paul the Apostle Paul the Apostle by the runner do you believe power was a prophet might watch that sure he was let me drop down now this is Paul a prophet for telling what would come to pass we want the scripture here where Paul was saying and the coming of the Lord they will come and falling away they will come and follow me away oh brother Stephen that one you are just interpreting the scripture anybody can prophesy I want to see show me where Paul is a prophet in the Bible God probably expose us to certain stuff so you hear it and you know you know what to inoculate in the church let's watch him do you believe God was a prophet if you notice every time God the problem gives this he doesn't give a scripture last week brother Brian have said that it was a prophet David was a prophet David was a prophet but brother brother never give a scripture brilliant you see your Prophet is not scripture yet last week I proved to you in the Bible that David was a prophet if you don't understand something in this message cheat out right that's right you don't play with prophets like that do you believe Paul what's the problem if I say Keep Calm you won't understand I'm saying that could so you get that really well to relax Paul came on the sea and saw a son what kind of sound did he see a pillar of fire on his word to the marriage brother Stephen you say Paul is a teacher you say Paul he is a prophet so in other words you are telling me that Paul have to gift oh my God [Music] but the Bible say God has set some in the church God has a person Prophet teacher evangelists and so forth up in the church God has set them in there and they are inspired for a certain word and then some people May possess more than but they are the head at least be one gift or more in the person but the problem is saying if you are a preacher you must have at least you cannot be a give a preacher without a gift you must have at least one gift if you have more no problem but at least one gift for you to preach the gospel so there are people that can help more than one gift yeah I understand you are talking about brother brother but to me I want to see the scripture foreign [Music] that's the gift that is in the church the five Ministry but it's possible we could have more than one like amen is it difficult amen the right people or any of those Now call a teacher Paul a prophet father brother said you can have more than one gift I know a quote that is bothering you I'm gonna come to that good just relax with me I know already the court is spinning in your mind but I'm saying you can't have two Ministry relax I'm gonna get to that I told you we are correcting things are you there relax with that just wait I'm coming when I do this do this I get your question at home before I preach them that's why I put them like that are you there it's possible we could help more than one gift for the teacher call a prophet we can have more than one gift Brothers give them it's okay we wanna see this in the Bible take the book of Acts chapter 13. young people this is not gay in the Book of Matthew chapter 18 make sure you will hit yourself my wife don't want me to say this but I don't want you to say brother Stephen said she kept telling me stop saying that everybody there everybody there Amen brother okay praise the Lord verse 1 now they were in the church that was image something what and stop we are loving the church we are we are dreaming putting a foundation in the Church of Antioch the Bible said they were did you see that yes yes teacher Bruno so there was not only one person many people have multiple gifts two gifts are you there and by the part of daughters when brother Branham said it did he give you a scripture was he lying this message is perfectly in line with the Bible glory to God something prophet and teacher as one of us so bad of us was a teacher and a prophet okay okay that was called neither he was a prophet amen a teacher and lucious of selling he was a prophet if you need more profit in the in the New Testament in the book of Acts in the after church and Maria he was a prophet and then age which have been brought with everybody and who saw amen so who was the prophet and a teacher brother Stephen you are talking about Saul you say Paul I only want to see the name God if I don't see the name Paul I won't believe it no problem drop to verse 9. so who also is called any question amen amen amen from today if you hear somebody saying brother grown up say Paul is not a prophet give him the Bible say prove to me where the Bible said Paul is not a prophet brother Branham said Paul is a prophet Paul is a teacher he never gives description now the scripture is telling us God was God prophet and teacher you say Saul verse man say son who is God all right that is taken care of today I gave you David last week Paul is taken care of today why are you getting bored buddy Stephen I have also a question you cannot have two gifts let's go slowly let me bring that quickly let's read it together [Music] that's what they talk about brother was a prophet okay God Jordan do the work of an Avenger by the man I'm saying if you've noticed he didn't say you are an Avengers but you do the work no problem didn't say was an Avenger said do the work of inventions I know this code will spin on someone are you there for the hour will come one God that is to be changed that hour is arriving all right yes you can mix Miss Miss brother pranam didn't say you get half [Music] we are correcting something you can't miss two or three different Ministry not you cannot have because by the word of goddess you can have more than one gift but you cannot mix two or three different Ministry together pastor and evangelist you cannot be a pastor and you keep going out and going out and going out and going out take care of the ship it doesn't mean he cannot travel it doesn't mean he cannot go somewhere for a meeting and come back but the frequency of living leaving the church living leaving the church living living the church that's why the problem when they say do the work of it evangelist he call brother give him the judge and brother brother miss out because you cannot wait I'm amazed amen amen you can't be a prophet and maybe a pastor that's why he gave it to brother at the same time the problem is the same time once you leave this you go to the other are you there because you have different works different Ministry evangelists want you to do this business a pastor wants you to take care of the tree the Bible said he left the sheep with another keeper everybody all right now why do we need thought why are we taking part Paul was very fundamental we know he's a teacher scripture in everything that he did now we all have to believe that because the Bible we will be beginning to believe the Bible God will not permit this man whose man Paul to write the Bible the books in the Bible that he did everybody ready okay I believe Paul of the New Testament was like Moses everybody there why did you put Moses here and why do you put Power okay I believe Paul of the New Testament was life Moses of the old so your modern Moses his power Jesus started from Moses we're standing by Paul and Paul was a missionary Prophet Apostle Prophet today not the Jews we gave you the scriptures on part one of this absolutely who wrote the book of Hebrew Paul should he was inspired to do it but why of Fire that made him worse in him amen Moses made the pillow fight just like Paul make the pillow fight yes I'm going slow that is the reason God he could write you go back in unveiling of God brother Adam said the pillar of fire was immersed so happened that's the reason Moses what the first four books of the Bible because that Pillar of Fire so the same thing that came to Moses that make him wrote books give us up to work no one the poor writes books because God does not change amen how would he ever know how creation study how did Moses know that in the beginning was the word in the beginning the word was informed without form on him Moses had that option no problem whatever happens take his Ephesians chapter 3. Hallelujah and lastly because I am joyful I can't say I'm feeling religious so my way is laughing hey Ephesians chapter 3 verse one everybody dead yes first of all for this cause I but I hope God the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you who choose oh thank you somebody's not sleeping check out if you have heard of the dispossession of what remember Jesus Jesus wife the dispensation of grace of God which was given to me to all you you are gender Moses was giving the law power was given and brought the problem said Paul is the Moses of the Earth you see that brother Branham is very scripture Amanda very scripture thank you let's take First Corinthians chapter three I will stop in the middle here then we'll pick up the other one okay this is Mother's Day First Corinthians chapter 3. if you dare you can say Amen First Corinthians chapter 3 verse 10. according to what according to what to the grace remember Paul in efficient God has that in this possession of one Grace was given to him and according to that dispensation of Grace they're pulling through the grace of God which give it to me I say wise Master building I have left the foundation of the dispensation of the Lord that's why we are standing through God you are the brother he said the mystery of God made not to us in this day by the same Heavenly messenger that was made known in them days notice the same purify that sent Moses the same period of fire that was on Moses that wrote the Bible the same Pillar of Fire that Paul meant on his road to Damascus Paul wrote the New Testament what they see but Paul had the Revelation he pulled it out for he had met the pillar of fire himself but Moses came on the sea he had the Revelation he met the pillar of fire and he was revealed Immortals out Genesis he wrote the first four books of the Bible was his name for he met God in the form of the pillar of fire then in the pillar of Fire okay Daddy's variable let me go here now Moses man defeats on earth made the Tabernacle like the things that he saw in heaven we know that don't we we find God did what the same thing must have Hebrew 9 that Moses men feeds just like he did and Paul in his vision when he went out into heaven when he taught that great book of Hebrew he must have saw in his vision the same thing down was his soul because he said that he thought that wonderful book of Hebrew so Bob is Moses of the Old Testament everybody did okay wrote the Bible those men came after Moses came after Abraham God came after the disciple but he wrote more than all of them are you there Paul both of them trained the same way Moses trained you know to deliver the children of Israel by military man Paul train to take them out of the hand of Roman and put them free by his ecclesiastical force in the world that did so this one was trained this one was trained power is your Moses of the Old Testament why is this important the great Angel of the Covenant that one who was with Moses in the wilderness that one who was with Paul who came to power on the road to the mice Damascus that same one spell written his picture with us [Music] in the picture in the last magazine the other day the same word by the same God through the same channel by the same way by the same promise Reborn and Paul download the Bible now send to reveal it [Applause] I'm married you see why we have to build the way we build it you see why they can't even swallow this do not descend great Jehovah that suffered Moses this is marriage and divorce Moses that servant and what would he tell his people in other words the people of Moses got in trouble about marriage and divorce God gave Moses the right as a messenger to give a solution to Israel by giving them a level of divorces when Paul came and found military divorce God gave God the authority to use his authority to solve the problem of marriage and divorce amen I stay on those two you read the court Moses that served and what would he tell the people and God you suffer him to give the writing of divorcement Paul the greatest talking to God he said you did this to us you need this to fall power of the great Apostle who was the mother of the New Testament as Moses of the O Lord Murphy is what they know and the dispensation of the Lord many Prophet their words were injected into it but Moses wrote The Lord You Suffer him a writing tonight the writing of divorcement the great example being the writer of the New Testament could also make such as they are such an assertion that I if this is called speaking like Moses say I give you the letter Paul also say I speak under this condition I not to the Lord Moses said that the lady of divorcement Paul said this is me this is not God [Music] United States so it is today amen okay the people of fire came today sorry is today God at the end of the world as we are here under the mercy of God knowing that soon we are to answer in his presence and that you have did so much love I am sure in the sight of these people they shall hang on to this life he comes from you amen and to Bear record here today and many people sitting here that are even so that sound up in the market where the angel of the Lord kept in the world away where he came they said in the seven angels where the revealing of the seven mystery was unfolded and that's their major in the same direction all the same Mountain the day he was revealed brother random said just like you get power authorization let you get Moses authorization I'm getting myself authorization to tell these people go and don't do it again what Authority one authorities this unfold The Mystery of the name of Billy Paul beautiful all right brother random heavy boy by the name of Billy Paul by the John I got you and we're going to stop it we got that Billy is a nickname for women because right here we have for this and Elijah someone we got our losses do we have an Elijah Moses here do we have any life because thirdly when we go to the Jews we find ourselves Moses and Elijah Moses Moses Elijah Moses Elijah God does not change Billy Williams [Music] and we know William was the name of brother Brown and the word that took him out of the hospital foreign I wanted to call her a Bible name I call my little boy Billy Paul after me and said Paul [Music] I'll let you something are you there brother Stephen this is no mystery this is a man giving them to his child by the part of Paul he just sit down he said hey I'm gonna give Billy Paul here we go now you guys that's the problem I have with you in the message everything brother I'm saying it's only Mysteries Mysteries Mysteries Mysteries a father can give his own son amen that is just a natural father who called him being Paul where is the problem can you put the camera back there please okay and don't worry has anybody found out where the boy is at yeah talking about people we have time to put a bell around him what we did someone wake him up he's first starting right now he is a nourishment too talking about people although his mother was a German hope he was born on Friday the 13th at three o'clock in the morning in the evening thank you we were else going to call him Jess which is the devil a sense of humor we don't believe in that way sir is playing with his son his mother was a German and I was the Irish so instead we call him honey Michael that was the name of Billy Paul I'm going slowly but God had us to call him it was not brother brother are you there it was God who does brother Branham called that boy Billy Paul from Paul corner be rebought from his father William and the great Apostle Paul yes sir hey man Moses Elijah Moses yes this is fake now many people condemned you I do not condemn Jonah you know they say well he's Jonah you have heard that expression but you must not do that Christian you should not condemn God's server he was not heard of the will of God he just did he did just exactly he must do that forever it is not again absolutely everything happened not by just happening it happened forever one time the prophet had to marry prostitute having children by him one way on his side for 340 years they don't offered to the other side one strip is close he brought a brother brother would have stripped his clothes with everything going on what are we going to say he's a false prophet you see he was preaching to Ella there Isaiah in the Bible stripping his club and prophesy naked go rejected the Bible for that so prophesy in the Bible naked go reject the Bible for that and to shock you more the son of God Jesus Christ was in the past naked standing the song and sending the faith of the Cross to Paradise naked amen thank you Lord thank you thank you Jesus just everything did for stands Jonah had to do it for sounds remember Abraham have to marry Edgar against his own will when Sarah gives the husband that he refuses but God appeared to him listen to Sarah because a full woman will not hear with the bad woman what is it a son all of it a son God that speaks for Sons when they say Billy Paul just like Moses prophesied for the coming of the Lord this is why we were stopping then Paul also prophesied for the second coming of the Lord he said Lord will come with a shark with the force of the Archangel and the cell members and the dead in Christ shall rise up again the Lord will not come until there is a falling away just like Moses called The Elder of Israel and told them that after my departure you will read Faith did Valor so-called the ambience let's see where Paul come here of the church and we stop right here let's take the book of Anthony chapter 20. if you're there you can say amen amen are they saying Amen brother Michael by the David okay uh verse 16. at 20 verse 16. for Paul have determined to sell by emphasis because he would not spend the time in Asia and from my righteous he sent to Ephesus and God did Moses called who why are these things lined up like that and God here there's just that church level 17 let's jump to verse 25. and now behold I know this is not talking that you are among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God shall see my face no more in other words I'm living just like Moses will stand in Israel what for I take you to wake up remember Moses was taking us up remember Moses last week I take you to write on this day that I am pure from the blood of all men remember Moses two kids I am right there he said I know I'm taking witness against the heaven or something then I'm leaving I know he says I'm taking you to record this day that I am pure from the blood of all men for I have not shown to declare to you all the Council of them of God take me therefore to yourself and to walk the flock of the witch the Holy Ghost has made you overseer to fill the Church of God which he has purchased with his own blood for not this that after my departure just like Moses said also on your own selves so not only are people gonna get in the message to God's trouble but some that believes the message before will rise in Apostle against it are you there but for us among yourself shall marry us speaking her first things and remember that by the expense of two years I cease not to warn you every night and day with tears and now Brethren are commend you to God and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all them which are Sanctified just like Moses about the second coming just like Moses told the church I know when I'm living you're gonna depart from the faith Paul is also telling the truth I know some will depart from the thing I know when I live some will be part of different when they depart from the faith then we will need the ministry to bring us back Paul Moses Paul Moses the third time we're going to get into this Paul and Moses God willing and then we will get to brother yes so when someone says something be like Elijah bring them a Bullock say bring two bring two bubble take one bubble you hold the other bubble you let them go first let them call back foreign he said you come take the bubble and shock me where I am saying then you better because the angel of the Lord don't go
