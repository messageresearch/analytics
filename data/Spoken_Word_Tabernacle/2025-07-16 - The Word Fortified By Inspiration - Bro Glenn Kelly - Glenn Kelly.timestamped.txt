[28:25] I always feel nervous when I come here,
[28:27] but I really wanted to share this
[28:28] testimony.
[28:30] Um last Monday was exactly 2 years after
[28:34] the kidney transplant and I want to
[28:36] thank God for um how far he has brought
[28:39] me and also want to thank God for the
[28:42] word that is coming out from the pulpit
[28:44] because he's really transforming us and
[28:46] I want to thank God for that and also
[28:48] thank God for wonderful brethren here
[28:50] and you know wonderful sisters who will
[28:53] always call to check up on on me
[28:55] whenever I'm not feeling well. Yeah. So,
[28:59] um
[29:01] I'm so nervous.
[29:03] Yeah. So, um uh
[29:07] I've been since after I had the kidney
[29:10] transplant. Um I remember the day when I
[29:14] came home that morning, I had to take
[29:17] like more than 10 medications. It was a
[29:20] lot in the morning, afternoon, and
[29:22] evening. And just the sight of the
[29:24] medications will always make me feel
[29:26] nauseous. It was hard. It was so hard.
[29:29] And I remember my husband telling me,
[29:31] "Don't worry. Very soon you'll be off of
[29:34] all this medication." Even though they
[29:36] always say when you had a a transplant,
[29:38] you have to be on medication for the
[29:40] rest of your life, but your case will be
[29:41] different. And I will say amen to it. So
[29:45] um
[29:47] we went I went to see my uh my doctor on
[29:50] Thursday last week Thursday and just
[29:52] going there and hearing her talk to me
[29:55] was so much encouraging like telling me
[29:57] how I'm doing so well and my lab's doing
[30:00] very good kidney functioning is is is at
[30:03] the top and my labs like she was amazed
[30:07] and then there there's this one
[30:09] particular medication that whenever I
[30:11] take whenever you see me at the back or
[30:13] you don't see me in church is that
[30:14] medication. Tomorrow will be the last
[30:17] day I'll be taking that medication.
[30:21] And and
[30:23] amen. Amen. And now the only medication
[30:29] I'm only taking three medications
[30:31] and I want to give glory to God and I
[30:33] believe in that that I will get off all
[30:35] this medication. Amen. I want to sing
[30:39] this song to glorify the name of the
[30:40] Lord.

[44:23] Brother Sam sent me a I mean a quote. It
[44:27] was uh like an audio quote and it seems
[44:29] like I used part of it before, but I'm
[44:31] like, "Okay, I'm going to load this up
[44:33] on Sunday." And I was sitting right
[44:35] there and begin to get again inspiration
[44:37] for Sunday. Boom, boom, boom. So, I have
[44:38] to write quickly. So, see you on Sunday,
[44:41] Lord's willing. And then we get into
[44:44] this season again. God is God love us so
[44:46] much.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; I mean we have been frustrated for
[44:49] years.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; We don't understand whether our prayer
[44:52] are going through or not. What is going
[44:54] on? Why do we ask certain things it
[44:57] works? Sometime it's not working. Now we
[44:59] begin to understand that everything is
[45:01] working together for good. Even when he
[45:04] say nos, his nose are even better
[45:06] because his nose are pro I mean
[45:08] protective and and and there is always a
[45:11] reason behind it.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. And at the end of the day we
[45:15] understand the better by and by. Amen.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; Glory glory. Hallelujah. I don't have a
[45:21] lot going on but brother Glenn is the
[45:24] one preaching tonight.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; Brother Glenn Kelly is preaching
[45:27] tonight.
[45:30] Amen. It has been a while he's not
[45:34] preaching. So sometime as normal people
[45:37] some people might have some questions
[45:39] and they say well why is everybody
[45:41] preaching? I'm just helping you saying
[45:44] what you don't want to say loud. Amen.
[45:47] That's how I help people. Amen. So you
[45:50] might say why isn't I preaching and this
[45:52] one is preaching. No no no there is
[45:53] nothing wrong.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; It's just we need to
[45:59] be wise.
[46:01] Amen.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; And know what we are doing. I was
[46:04] talking to somebody last night. I said,
[46:06] "By the brother, I'm say the greatest
[46:07] gift is wisdom."
[46:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you look at his age and what
[46:12] he's doing for the kingdom of God,
[46:14] preaching at the prison, deacon going to
[46:17] people's home and checking and going in
[46:19] the hospital, but Glenn is almost more
[46:22] available all the time. He's there
[46:24] staying late being with people. If you
[46:27] use him up too much,
[46:30] you're gonna break him down. And we
[46:32] still need his wisdom.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; This is things minister need to
[46:36] understand. That's why I don't preach
[46:38] often on Wednesday and I don't preach on
[46:40] Wednesday because I got brothers and God
[46:43] have equipped me with brothers here and
[46:46] in church. You need to be wise to
[46:48] understand what God is doing. And with
[46:51] his age, we need to protect his health
[46:53] &gt;&gt; because I need his wisdom. We need his
[46:56] discernment. We need him for the church.
[46:58] So I cannot use him the way I'm using a
[47:01] young man.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; So I'm going to give him some time and
[47:04] then he take his break and once he's
[47:06] available I say now elder you come and
[47:08] then preach. Amen. So for those who have
[47:11] been wondering
[47:15] &gt;&gt; online and local because I got a big
[47:18] audience online, a big church online. So
[47:20] this is the answer. So once in a while
[47:23] you let him preach and we keep him
[47:25] healthy. Amen. So let's sing onlyly
[47:27] believe and pull on the gift of the
[47:29] Lord.
[47:32] Oh
[47:35] believe.
[47:38] [Music]
[47:40] Oh
[47:43] believe.
[47:44] [Music]

[49:11] Lord,
[49:14] I believe.
[49:19] All things are possible.
[49:23] [Music]
[49:32] Hallelujah.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Our hearts and mind are
[49:37] clear.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.

[49:41] &gt;&gt; You know, so writing musicians is
[49:43] getting going to their seats. Uh,
[49:45] brother Steve, he covered for me. I said
[49:47] good. He said everything needed to be
[49:50] said, right?
[49:51] &gt;&gt; So, you know, the enemy always come in,
[49:53] right? And then he tried to mess with
[49:55] your mind. But, you know, we got a
[49:57] little just a few words of encouragement
[49:59] tonight. Uh, how many of the pastor was
[50:01] burning inside of me, you know? So, we
[50:03] went out like he said, by God's grace,
[50:06] it's an honor for me to serve his
[50:08] people. It's an honor for me to do the
[50:10] will of the Lord. It's an honor. So, we
[50:12] give him praise. We give him honor. We
[50:14] give him glory. We thank the pastor and
[50:17] his family and all the uh young
[50:19] ministers there looking at them. I might
[50:22] run down here and grab and get some
[50:24] juice tonight. Huh? You know when these
[50:26] young ministers sitting on the front
[50:28] down here, right? But we just thank you
[50:30] all for your grace and and your mercy
[50:32] and all those uh visible and invisible
[50:36] audience. Uh we thank you for your
[50:38] prayers and all that you do. And so
[50:41] continue to move forward. And God, just
[50:42] have a little thought for us tonight.
[50:44] And the Lord even allow me to share some
[50:46] testimonies what the Lord is allowing us
[50:48] to do out of this ministry sitting up
[50:51] under this ministry here. You know,
[50:53] God's doing some great things.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; Our hearts and mind are clear.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Lord God, we thank you for
[50:59] your grace, your mercy. We thank you,
[51:01] Father, for the opportunity just to come
[51:03] before your precious children, Lord God,
[51:05] here tonight. Father, strengthen those
[51:08] who had a desire to be here, Lord God,
[51:10] and bless those that are streaming, Lord
[51:12] God, that couldn't make it in tonight,
[51:14] Father. But we look unto the hill to
[51:16] where our strength and our help cometh
[51:18] from, Lord God. We the lot has fallen
[51:21] here tonight, Father. So, we need
[51:23] wisdom. We need the knowledge. We need
[51:25] your understanding. We need revelation
[51:27] to come and speak to your people here
[51:29] tonight. You saw this day. Now, Father,
[51:32] we come to put the Lord Jesus Christ on
[51:35] display here. So, get glory to thy name.
[51:38] Give glory to thy kingdom, Lord God. Do
[51:41] something new, Father, for your people,
[51:44] Father. So, we give you praise. We give
[51:46] you honor. We give you glory. We thank
[51:48] you. And by faith, we claim it all done
[51:50] in Jesus name we pray. Amen. And amen.
[51:54] And we won't keep you standing. Let's
[51:56] turn to two passages of scriptures.
[51:58] Second, we're gonna go to second
[51:59] Timothy,
[52:01] a familiar passage of scripture here.
[52:04] And let's look at chapter three. Second
[52:07] Timothy 3.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; And then we'll go to um E Ephesians 6.
[52:16] After that, once you have it, second
[52:19] Timothy 3:16.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[52:23] It says all scriptures
[52:25] &gt;&gt; that's right
[52:25] &gt;&gt; is given by the inspiration of God.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; And it's for and it's for reproof. I
[52:35] mean pro is profitable
[52:37] doctrine
[52:39] &gt;&gt; for reproof
[52:40] &gt;&gt; for correction
[52:42] &gt;&gt; for instructions
[52:43] &gt;&gt; in righteousness.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; You know that's a powerful scripture.
[52:47] That's a divine you're talking about a
[52:49] divine revelation there. because that
[52:52] scripture is coming from the inspiration
[52:55] of God. Okay. And our topic tonight, the
[52:58] word fortified by inspiration.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; The word being fortified by inspiration.
[53:05] The Bible said the letter killth and the
[53:07] spirit give life. Is that right? So we
[53:09] totally dependent upon the Holy Spirit.
[53:12] That's why we look in this hour here
[53:14] now. We see the prophecies and things
[53:16] coming forth. So, we know we're soon at
[53:19] the look up that redemption is soon
[53:21] coming. That rapture is right at hand,
[53:23] right?
[53:24] &gt;&gt; We know. Let's see. And let's go to
[53:26] Ephesians 6. And we go to Ephesians 6.
[53:30] Here, Lord help me. He says in let's
[53:35] start at we just got three verses here.
[53:37] Let's start at verse 10. Ephesians 6 and
[53:40] 10. Finally, my brother, be strong in
[53:43] the Lord
[53:44] &gt;&gt; and in the power of his might. That's
[53:46] right.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; He said, "Put on the whole armor of God
[53:49] that ye may be able to to stand against
[53:52] the ws of the devil." That's right.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; He said, "For we wrestle," and this is
[53:56] what we really want to keep in mind
[53:58] because for we wrestle not against flesh
[54:00] and blood. That's right.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Okay? But against principalities,
[54:05] against powers, against the rulers of
[54:08] darkness of this world, against
[54:10] spiritual wickedness in high places. May
[54:13] the Lord add a blessing to the reading
[54:14] of his word. You know what we looking at
[54:16] here tonight? You know, we have to
[54:18] understand when you come into the house
[54:20] of the Lord, the house of the Lord, God
[54:23] has an order. Is that right? Remember
[54:25] our battle tonight. We're going to read
[54:27] quotes. Uh we kind of loaded tonight,
[54:30] pastor. I I cover for you. Okay. You
[54:32] didn't read no quotes Sunday, but we got
[54:34] some over here, right?
[54:38] So, can I preach like I'm out there?
[54:40] Look, let me preach the way God made me.
[54:43] Is that right? Can I walk that way?
[54:46] Stand in the word. Okay. Because we come
[54:48] against the devil. And we come against
[54:50] the devil. I have no respect for the
[54:53] devil. Is that right? I got the devil's
[54:56] answer because God's given it to us,
[54:58] right?
[54:59] &gt;&gt; By the seventh angel messenger.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Satan. We're going to read something in
[55:05] a minute. Satan always fighting against
[55:09] the word
[55:10] &gt;&gt; and he's always fighting against God's
[55:12] prophet. He always has. He always will.
[55:16] Is that right?
[55:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; See, but we have to understand. He says
[55:20] it's going to be so close.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; It will deceive the very elect
[55:26] &gt;&gt; if it was possible.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; But it's not possible. Is that right?
[55:30] Ah, because our name was written in the
[55:34] lamb's book of life before the
[55:37] foundation of the world.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[55:41] &gt;&gt; Got to hear it. We got this here.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; I want to read this one. It came out of
[55:47] want to look at u Hebrews 3.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; And I want to read this quote here
[55:53] because it just kept ringing in my
[55:55] spirit. So I said I better read it
[55:58] because that first verse there in in
[56:02] Hebrew chapter 3 and verse one Yes sir.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; is is real. I don't want to get a hold
[56:08] of myself but when I get out there you
[56:09] know this is the year. Is that right?
[56:13] &gt;&gt; It's a Bible question is a Bible answer.
[56:15] It went from Genesis to Revelation. Is
[56:17] that right? God has opened his word.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Look at this quote here. It's 3:19.
[56:23] See, some of we come in here and we got
[56:26] certain situations. So, you got to
[56:29] understand I'm God gave me grace to get
[56:31] out of my amen corner, but I'll be back
[56:33] in my amen corner soon. Okay? Only God
[56:36] because the footsteps of the righteous
[56:38] is order of the Lord. Is that right?
[56:40] That's why you understand love. We got a
[56:43] great pastor. God sent him here. Well,
[56:46] you got a double portion. You got a
[56:48] pastor and you got a teacher. Is that
[56:50] right? And the prophet God said the
[56:52] enemy can't get into that. Is that
[56:54] right? So the leoty has to understand
[56:57] these things. Okay. So when you come
[56:59] into the house of the Lord, uh, you come
[57:02] in there with your spiritual cap on. Is
[57:04] that right? You got to come in so you
[57:06] can realize the way the enemy attacking
[57:09] people, attacking individuals in the
[57:11] flesh. No way. Not in the house of the
[57:14] Lord. Is that right? This is the
[57:16] spiritual hospital. Okay. We got his
[57:19] answer. So when you come in here, it's
[57:22] something you got your mind on and it
[57:24] shouldn't be on. Uhoh.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Huh? He that keep his mind on Christ, I
[57:33] will grant him what? Perfect peace. Is
[57:36] that right? Huh? We're going to get
[57:38] somewhere in a minute. You know, I can't
[57:40] help. I love kicking up, beating on the
[57:42] devil. Is that right? I'm going tell you
[57:44] about See, my theme been in the
[57:46] institutions in the prisons. You know
[57:48] what it been, pastor? Salvation versus
[57:51] religion.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Is salvation versus
[57:55] religion. That's been my theme from day
[57:58] one. Is that right? Because we wrestle
[58:00] not against flesh and blood. Okay. So
[58:03] you got to understand the demon forces
[58:06] is hiding behind religion. Is that
[58:09] right?
[58:10] &gt;&gt; Huh? So you got to realize that Cain and
[58:12] had Abel, it started in the garden,
[58:14] didn't it? And when it started in the
[58:16] garden, Cain and Abel, Cain worshiped
[58:19] God.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Cain believed God.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; Cain did the same thing. Built the
[58:25] altars like Abel did. But the difference
[58:28] was was one thing. What? He had no
[58:30] revelation. Is that right? Inspiration
[58:34] by revelation. Is that right? So we got
[58:38] to understand that you can have a
[58:40] inspiration, but if you're not in the
[58:42] channel with God, it's not going to
[58:44] produce what God has called for. Is that
[58:47] right?
[58:51] &gt;&gt; Coming in the house of the Lord. But
[58:53] this is the one that dropped in my
[58:54] spirit.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I'll do my best, sister Edith.
[58:57] I'll do my best. Now I get to go down.
[59:01] Always remember what we're here for.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; This is 31964.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Always remember what we're here for is
[59:11] try to increase your faith in his
[59:13] presence.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; He says that you might receive that
[59:18] which you ask that you ask for it.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Then by faith you believe.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; That's right. You see? So you got to
[59:26] catch the inspiration.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Huh? You got to catch the inspiration at
[59:32] that time. Is that right?
[59:34] &gt;&gt; So under that inspiration, somebody can
[59:37] get saved. Uh somebody can get
[59:39] delivered. Somebody can get healed. Uh
[59:42] somebody can have their financial need
[59:44] met. Is that right? Because this is the
[59:47] throne of God. He that have an ear, let
[59:49] him hear what the spirit has to say. Is
[59:52] that right? Come on, saint. We're going
[59:54] to read something here tonight. Once
[59:56] you're fortified, you're fortified by
[59:59] the word of God. It's always positive.
[1:00:03] [Music]
[1:00:05] [Applause]
[1:00:12] Ah, that's just the way I preach when
[1:00:15] I'm out there.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Huh? Shake the devil up. You know why?
[1:00:19] Because they're used to people coming to
[1:00:21] the institution. Pastor, well, you know,
[1:00:24] we're here tonight, my friend.
[1:00:27] I come here from such and such church
[1:00:30] and we're representing. Yeah. And then
[1:00:32] when you hear somebody coming in, say,
[1:00:36] [Applause]
[1:00:43] takes the devil. Huh?
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; He said, "What kind of religion is
[1:00:46] this?" This ain't no religion. This is
[1:00:49] the message of the hour.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; That's what it is.
[1:01:00] [Music]
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; He said, look, he said, he said,
[1:01:04] remember,
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He He says that every
[1:01:08] redemptive blessing
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; has already been purchased.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; He said he said the price is paid. There
[1:01:19] is only one way that you ever the only
[1:01:22] one way that you be able to receive it
[1:01:25] is to believe it and accept it. He's the
[1:01:29] high priest of our confession. Amen.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Hebrew 3:1, "Wherefore, holy brethren,
[1:01:36] partakers of the heavenly calling,
[1:01:39] consider the apostle and high priest of
[1:01:42] our profession, Jesus Christ." But that
[1:01:46] one word stop me, consider. You see,
[1:01:49] don't consider nothing else that the
[1:01:51] devil tell you. Only consider what Jesus
[1:01:54] Christ has already paid for for each and
[1:01:57] every one of us. Amen.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; That's all we considering. Is that
[1:02:02] right?
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Anyhow,
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; he said, look, he said the Hebrew says
[1:02:10] there that the Hebrew letter says the
[1:02:12] high priest of our profession. Of
[1:02:14] course, to profess and confess is the
[1:02:17] same thing.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; He's the high priest of our confession.
[1:02:21] Uh-huh.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Therefore, he cannot do anything on on
[1:02:27] for us until we first what?
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Confess it.
[1:02:34] [Music]
[1:02:35] [Applause]
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; My brother,
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; we're going to get some somebody
[1:02:41] confessing tonight. We're going to get
[1:02:43] somebody delivered tonight.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Somebody going to get it. Why? When
[1:02:47] understanding comes, confidence come.
[1:02:49] Confidence come, your faith come. And
[1:02:51] when your faith come, you know why? I
[1:02:53] can walk out like that. Seventh thing,
[1:02:55] brother Steve, when I go in the
[1:02:56] institutions, I walk like that seventh
[1:02:58] angel. Huh?
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; That's just the way I walk around him.
[1:03:03] Just like this. I got no use for the
[1:03:06] devil. Is that right? Especially when
[1:03:09] you know God sent you somewhere.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; He'll manifest it. He'll vindicate it.
[1:03:14] Is that right?
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh, religious demons, help me. Let
[1:03:19] me keep going. Let me show you what he
[1:03:21] said here.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now the high priest of our
[1:03:24] confession, he cannot do anything for us
[1:03:27] until first we confess that that it has
[1:03:30] been done."
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; He says, "And then when we confess it,
[1:03:35] then he is the high priest,
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; a mediator to go to work on that and
[1:03:41] make it right."
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; He says, "So we pray trusting in God."
[1:03:46] He said his kindness and his mercy that
[1:03:48] he will give to to us. Now look what
[1:03:52] we're talking. We're talking about the
[1:03:53] word fortified by inspiration.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; All scriptures are written by
[1:04:01] inspiration.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; But all scriptures you got to understand
[1:04:06] the inspiration we're going to come when
[1:04:08] the inspiration comes it comes by
[1:04:11] revelation.
[1:04:13] We'll see. Just just bear with us. By
[1:04:15] the grace of God, we come in here to
[1:04:18] take you up there to another level. Some
[1:04:20] speak words and it's just them speaking
[1:04:23] it. Is that right? But we got to
[1:04:25] remember that God gave us the best. Is
[1:04:28] that right?
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; I'll read another hair quote for you.
[1:04:32] So, I don't I don't want to get ahead of
[1:04:34] myself. Most of the time when I'm out
[1:04:36] there, I'm doing a lot of preaching. Let
[1:04:37] me slow down here. We got here 53162.
[1:04:43] Look what he says here. And this is in
[1:04:46] the conflict between God and Satan. He
[1:04:49] says, "In Eden, God knew his enemy and
[1:04:51] all the attacks of his enemy."
[1:04:54] Do you know your enemy?
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; See? Huh?
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; See, you got to understand now. God is
[1:05:02] infinite. God, and the infinite God is
[1:05:06] the perfect of the perfections.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; I'm talking to the fortified perfection
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; every time. Uh-huh.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; See who who chose you?
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Who brought you?
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; We come from God. We go back to God.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; He says he knew all things before they
[1:05:29] ever was.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; That's right. He says, "And therefore,
[1:05:33] if this infinite God could have looked
[1:05:35] forward,
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; and he did."
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; He said, "And seen the the end from the
[1:05:41] beginning."
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; See, because he can be all places
[1:05:44] because he know all things. Is that
[1:05:46] right?
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; He says, he he said God could have
[1:05:50] looked forward and seen it from the
[1:05:52] beginning and knew that he would have
[1:05:55] children on this earth.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; That's right. He knew that he was going
[1:05:59] to have children on this earth in Leoa.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; You belong to God. You come from God. Uh
[1:06:06] see that's how Eve, remember Eve got
[1:06:09] deceived. Satan came to her and said,
[1:06:11] "You'll be like who?"
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; But they was already God's.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Satan already know who you are. You got
[1:06:21] to move into your position.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; He knew they was God's. Preach
[1:06:28] some of that out in now. They look at
[1:06:29] you like you're crazy.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; Huh? Satan identify who they was.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Let us keep going. Look what he says.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; I knew from the beginning he says an
[1:06:39] infinite God. He says, he knew he was
[1:06:43] going to have children on this earth.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; His own his own blessed children.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; Don't you believe that he will provide
[1:06:52] for them the best that he could provide?
[1:06:55] Amen.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Ah.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Just raise your hand since if I'm going
[1:07:02] too fast.
[1:07:04] Later on, I might take off now.
[1:07:07] Okay. He said, "Now look, he he he says,
[1:07:10] we're not we're not you tonight to your
[1:07:13] children. If they was helpless little
[1:07:15] fellas, take care of them. Don't you
[1:07:18] struggle to work, do any Don't you
[1:07:20] struggle to go to work. do everything
[1:07:22] that you can to provide the best you
[1:07:24] can. Huh? To provide for those children.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; He said because you are a father, a
[1:07:31] parent.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Is that right? He says and I say the
[1:07:35] truth and thought of a earthly parent
[1:07:39] and a parent originated where at God. So
[1:07:43] the first original office as a parent
[1:07:48] originated as God. So you got to get
[1:07:52] your information from God. Uh so you go
[1:07:56] to God, trust in the Lord in all thy
[1:07:59] ways. He will lead and he will guide. He
[1:08:02] will direct thy path. Acknowledge him in
[1:08:06] all thy ways. Uh our father which are in
[1:08:11] heaven, hallowed be thy name. Uh thy
[1:08:15] kingdom come. Uh thy holy ghost come. uh
[1:08:18] thy holy ghost come uh so that thy will
[1:08:22] could be done uh on earth as it is in
[1:08:25] heaven. Forgive us as we forgive our
[1:08:28] debt in us. But lead us not into what?
[1:08:31] Temptation.
[1:08:33] Oh, some of you struggling because you
[1:08:35] forgetting about forgiveness.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; I don't know which way I'm going. I'm
[1:08:44] depending on him.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Huh? Look what he says.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Lead us not into temptation.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Sir,
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; we're going to show you why some so many
[1:08:53] of them get in trouble when they go out
[1:08:55] there. We're going to show you what
[1:08:57] happened to Moses, too. We got a lot of
[1:08:59] Don't y'all get upset with your wives
[1:09:00] when she when she straighten you out. We
[1:09:02] got a lot of zaporas in here. They
[1:09:04] better thank God for them zaporas.
[1:09:09] [Applause]
[1:09:11] Huh?
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; I'mma show you how important she was in
[1:09:17] that scripture in a minute.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, stubborn men. Is that right? Huh?
[1:09:23] Tell me this ain't the pastor. I'm I'm
[1:09:25] not preaching. Huh? Get around in there.
[1:09:28] They want to do everything their way
[1:09:29] instead of God's way.
[1:09:33] Huh? Every time I ask my wife when I
[1:09:36] said someone's in my house, anyone in my
[1:09:38] family, anyone come visit. If my house
[1:09:41] wasn't right, I told him I'm the blame.
[1:09:43] How you going to put the blame on them
[1:09:45] if you in charge?
[1:09:48] God's the father. He's in charge.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; You can't break the scriptures.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Turn it over.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:10:04] Look what he says.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now,
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; and you'll know them by their fruits."
[1:10:09] Yes, sir.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Look at these fine children.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Huh? Look at these fine children.
[1:10:15] Christian children, man.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Because God, the footsteps of the
[1:10:20] righteous is ordered of the Lord.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; And they recognize, train up a child in
[1:10:27] the way that he should go. When he grow
[1:10:29] old, he will not depart from him. Grow
[1:10:32] him up in the admiration of the Lord.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Keep up the good work, Elijah.
[1:10:40] Hallelujah.
[1:10:41] Huh?
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; He said, look, he said, God, because he
[1:10:50] was the first parent,
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Don't you think that,
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Seeing that Satan,
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Satan would be what Satan would do,
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. He gave to his children
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; and provided for them
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; the best thing that he could be. Provide
[1:11:08] for them.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. The best. Because
[1:11:11] you're the very best. You're the very
[1:11:15] best. I made you very good. Not just
[1:11:19] good. Very good. Don't listen to Satan.
[1:11:28] You know, when you're down there praying
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; and you know, pastor, when the Holy
[1:11:32] Ghost allowed you to minister that
[1:11:34] little lesson,
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; see, he got over there. Some have to
[1:11:37] realize
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; when they committed those acts,
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; we were sinners.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; Don't you listen to Satan try to condemn
[1:11:49] you. He said when when when those that
[1:11:52] are in Christ Jesus, no condemnation.
[1:11:54] who those that are in Christ Jesus. We
[1:11:57] walk not after the flesh, but after the
[1:12:00] spirit. Is that right? Don't let Satan
[1:12:02] try to condemn you with that.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; You got to understand God is bringing
[1:12:06] his word back to the capstone.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Huh? That's what it is. You got to
[1:12:11] realize
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; it's the Holy Ghost. Is Christ back on
[1:12:14] the scene?
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; That's those young men. Huh? I wish I to
[1:12:17] have those young men had when the Lord
[1:12:20] teaching them. Huh? What he tell them
[1:12:22] when they looking for a bride? sisters,
[1:12:24] you get one of these young men and those
[1:12:27] that's looking in, you don't have to
[1:12:29] worry about uh what kind of man you
[1:12:31] getting. He's going to be a Christian.
[1:12:33] Is that right?
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Because in the scriptures, what did he
[1:12:36] say? Uh he said what? They got to be
[1:12:39] what, pastor? A grown man.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; They got to be mature.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Because who that? Adam was a grown man.
[1:12:48] Is that right,
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; brother Charles? You know what I'mma do
[1:12:51] when I see Adam? I'm say, Adam, they say
[1:12:53] you the only one don't have a belly
[1:12:54] button. Let me see if you got a belly
[1:12:56] button or not, Adam.
[1:12:59] [Applause]
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; See, don't right because God made him a
[1:13:05] grown man.
[1:13:08] [Applause]
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; And then the second thing, a man got to
[1:13:12] have the Holy Ghost.
[1:13:14] [Applause]
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; You got to have the Holy Ghost.
[1:13:20] And then after he got the Holy Ghost,
[1:13:23] then a man got to do what? He got to
[1:13:25] give him a what? A job.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; He gave him a job.
[1:13:32] Adam ran the earth. Is that right? And
[1:13:35] he gave him a job. Is that right?
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; Eve ain't in the picture yet.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Eve ain't in the picture yet.
[1:13:51] Because there's one more thing you got
[1:13:52] to get. You got to get the message of
[1:13:55] the hour.
[1:13:57] The word of God that's inspired. Is that
[1:14:01] right?
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Huh? You got to have it. Now you're
[1:14:05] getting ready to do what? Get you a
[1:14:07] bride. Is that right? Hallelujah.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, sisters, you got some grace, too,
[1:14:15] don't they? Huh?
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Talking about courtship, didn't he?
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; He says, "Where you, you know, the red,
[1:14:20] yellow, green light? That might mean to
[1:14:22] y'all just driving out there, red,
[1:14:24] yellow, green. That might mean just the
[1:14:27] light hanging out there." But these
[1:14:29] sisters, it mean a little more. Is that
[1:14:31] right? He said red. When you got the
[1:14:33] red, that's what courtship. Boom. Hold
[1:14:35] it. We going to Now you got your
[1:14:36] courtship. Is that right?
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; Huh? Then you got the yellow light. The
[1:14:43] yellow light is the engagement. Is that
[1:14:45] right?
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; And then now they got the engagement.
[1:14:50] But certain things got to be asked in
[1:14:52] the engagement. Is that right?
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Certain things got to be can be asked in
[1:14:56] the engagement. If you find out
[1:14:58] something ain't right, you ain't got to
[1:15:00] get stuck with a knucklehead. Now,
[1:15:08] [Applause]
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; you ain't got to get stuck with him. Is
[1:15:12] that right? That's a yellow light. You
[1:15:15] moving with caution. Huh? Caution.
[1:15:17] Caution. Should I go through this light
[1:15:19] or not? Huh?
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; And then if everything is okay, you got
[1:15:24] what? Marriage. Is that right? Huh? Now
[1:15:27] you got the green light. Is that right?
[1:15:29] You can go. I don't know how we got on
[1:15:31] that. Huh?
[1:15:38] If I let something if I left something
[1:15:40] out the pastor uh he he'll cover me.
[1:15:43] Hallelujah.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Look what he's saying there. Now
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; he said God because God and Satan he
[1:15:50] says God because he was the first
[1:15:52] parent.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Don't you think that God seen what Satan
[1:15:56] would be?
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; What Satan would do? He gave to his
[1:16:01] children and provided for them. The best
[1:16:04] thing that could be provided for them.
[1:16:07] He said to knowing knowing what the
[1:16:10] enemy's attack would be.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Now remember he said our our lesson is
[1:16:15] fortified by the inspiration. Word
[1:16:18] fortified by inspiration.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Look at here. See what brother Brandon
[1:16:22] said. He said God fortified his
[1:16:26] children. That's right.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; You are fortified by God.
[1:16:31] [Applause]
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; You got virtue coming out of you by God.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Huh? You don't have to back up nothing.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Huh? You don't have to fear anything of
[1:16:43] the devil. Is that right?
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; God is fortifying you. God has chosen
[1:16:48] you. You were there in his mind before
[1:16:50] the foundation of the world.
[1:16:53] Amen.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Inspiration.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Look what he says.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; He said, "God knew
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; this great war was coming on between
[1:17:06] right and wrong."
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; God knew it. See, everybody got spies.
[1:17:11] Okay.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Everybody got spies here. Get out of
[1:17:15] this jacket.
[1:17:21] It's for you. I just
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; I know how the devil be messing with
[1:17:30] people mind. So you got to understand
[1:17:33] between here and there, it's the devil.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; See, and he got the mind on the people.
[1:17:39] Is that right?
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Just like he said, if you know my
[1:17:45] schedule, she know it. The Lord know and
[1:17:47] the pastor know it. You ain't gaining no
[1:17:49] weight. Just keep going. Hallelujah.
[1:17:53] He said, look,
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; he said wrong. He says he knew what the
[1:17:57] enemy was going to do. He knew just
[1:18:01] exactly how to equip his people.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; God know how to That's why he said, "Put
[1:18:08] on the whole armor of God
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; so you may be able to withstand the w of
[1:18:15] a devil in his end time." Yes sir.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; So we got to understand the armor of God
[1:18:22] is that is the word of God. The
[1:18:24] fortified word of God. Is that right?
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; And he also send us a fivefold ministry.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Is that right? To dress his bride up in
[1:18:35] this hour here, saints.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; What did he say? The
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; the helmet of salvation, breastplate of
[1:18:44] righteousness. Is that right?
[1:18:45] preparation of the gospel of peace upon
[1:18:47] your feet. Girt your loin is that with
[1:18:50] strength.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Let us keep going. Help us Lord.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; He says how to equipped his people.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; So if we notice the very first thing God
[1:19:00] equipped his children being infinite, he
[1:19:03] know what to He know what it took to
[1:19:07] defeat Satan. God knows what it takes to
[1:19:09] defeat Satan. Then why are you listening
[1:19:11] to the bluff?
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; Huh? He's already a defeated enemy.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; He's a bluff man. If you stand on the
[1:19:19] word of God, keep the word before me.
[1:19:23] David said, I keep the word before me at
[1:19:25] all times.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; He said, look what he says.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; He said, now help me, Lord.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; He said, equip Satan any He said he
[1:19:36] knows what to defeat Satan anytime, any
[1:19:40] place, anywhere.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:43] and any conditions. Yes, sir.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; and any conditions.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; With his stripes, I'm what?
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; I'm healed. Uh all you got to do is
[1:19:54] confess it. Confess the word. Uh speak
[1:19:58] the word. Uh then it'll move upon it. Is
[1:20:01] that right? But you got to catch the
[1:20:04] inspiration
[1:20:06] when it's under that inspiration.
[1:20:08] See, I can That's like I can't have
[1:20:10] prayer lines. I can't touch them.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; You see, best thing I could do is maybe
[1:20:15] bump them. Is that right? I can give
[1:20:17] them a bump, but that's all I can do. Is
[1:20:19] that right? So, you got to ask God to
[1:20:22] give you that word, anointed word, by
[1:20:25] inspiration to go out and prick their
[1:20:28] souls. Is that right? Get a man to
[1:20:30] repent. It's the gospel. I'm going to
[1:20:32] show you how powerful this gospel is.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Show you what brother Brandham said
[1:20:38] about that gospel. Yeah.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Want to want to challenge God, you let
[1:20:43] you belong to God.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; When the devil come and challenge you,
[1:20:48] you just remember Calvary at the cross.
[1:20:50] At the cross where I first saw the light
[1:20:53] and the burdens of my heart rolled away.
[1:20:55] It was there by faith I received my
[1:20:58] sight. Is that right? Living, he loved
[1:21:00] me. Dying, he saved me. Buried, he
[1:21:02] carried my sins fall away. Rise and he
[1:21:05] justify me. Ah, let me keep going cuz I
[1:21:08] got a lot here. I got a lot. I ain't
[1:21:10] going to keep you long, but I want to
[1:21:11] cover this. God help me.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Brother Sam, I know you're looking in.
[1:21:15] Don't get me if I don't cover it all. He
[1:21:17] said, now look.
[1:21:19] He said, now and and now look at the
[1:21:21] great new He said, now great new
[1:21:24] warfare. He said, but God,
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; he says, let me help me, Lord. He says,
[1:21:29] like we we're in a military force, the
[1:21:31] old bow and arrow. He said the
[1:21:32] sledgehammer. He says, that's next. He
[1:21:35] says after the bow and arrow, he said
[1:21:37] the musket. Now you know brother
[1:21:38] Brandham's talking about how things
[1:21:39] progressed during weapons in the wars.
[1:21:42] Is that right? He says the atomic
[1:21:44] weapons and things. He said we keep
[1:21:46] growing more. Look at this here though.
[1:21:48] He said but God
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; at the beginning
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; gave his children
[1:21:55] gave his children the atomic weapon.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; He said because he's the infinite God.
[1:22:02] That's right. Now, seeing there was
[1:22:04] going to be a conflict and there was
[1:22:06] going to be a battle, God equipped his
[1:22:09] children with the right kind of
[1:22:11] ammunition, the right kind of attack. He
[1:22:14] said, "The right kind of everything,
[1:22:17] everything."
[1:22:19] He says, "Now look, that they may need
[1:22:22] that they may need that would sweep them
[1:22:25] all the way from Eden
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; to the rapture.
[1:22:34] It's already in you.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; It's already in you.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; God got to bring it. We're going to show
[1:22:41] you what God does as he progresses. Is
[1:22:44] that right?
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because what we got body,
[1:22:48] spirit, and soul, right? You got body,
[1:22:50] spirit, and soul. And deep down inside
[1:22:52] of you, what? You got to you see, taste,
[1:22:56] feel, smell, and hear, right? Is that
[1:22:58] body? Is that right? The spiritual man.
[1:23:00] Then we got the spiritual man. This what
[1:23:02] most of you Christians get deceived at.
[1:23:05] Imagination, memory, reasoning,
[1:23:08] conscience, and affection. Is that
[1:23:09] right? That's what got Eve. Reasoning,
[1:23:12] intellect. Is that right? Huh? You ought
[1:23:14] to see them out there, too. Them
[1:23:17] religious demon. I'm telling you, there
[1:23:19] see hiding. I had one fell sit at a
[1:23:22] table the other day. Pastor was at his
[1:23:24] study. You know what? He turned around.
[1:23:26] I mean, he quote scriptures. Running
[1:23:27] quote scripture. Sitting around in
[1:23:29] there. I've been looking at this fell.
[1:23:30] He's shutting them up. He was shutting
[1:23:32] them up. They wouldn't say nothing.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; And that fell, I ain't say nothing to
[1:23:36] him. I said, "Lord,
[1:23:38] this is the first time he's seen him."
[1:23:41] But what is he doing?
[1:23:44] He just had a good memory.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; God said, "Don't say nothing. Just watch
[1:23:53] him and listen."
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; I We'll be back. Is that right?
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:01] But see, the fella didn't want to accept
[1:24:02] his me. Let me tell this testimony here.
[1:24:05] Fella didn't want to accept his message.
[1:24:07] We were sitting at the table. I'm just
[1:24:08] letting him have his way. Fella didn't
[1:24:10] want this testimony. We were sitting at
[1:24:12] the table and we were sitting there at
[1:24:14] the table and we got around in there and
[1:24:16] he got over there and the guy sat there
[1:24:18] and he said he was talking about Elijah.
[1:24:21] And we were talking about Elijah. So he
[1:24:23] said, "Uh, Brother Glenn, how about the
[1:24:25] next week you you you talk about
[1:24:27] Elijah." I said, "Oh Lord, this is the
[1:24:29] Lord here, right?" So I know
[1:24:31] denominations don't don't ain't going to
[1:24:33] like this, right? So we were sitting
[1:24:35] there with all the denomination guy. So
[1:24:37] I said, "Elijah got to come five times."
[1:24:39] This is the following week, short
[1:24:41] version of it. Here's the guy over
[1:24:42] there. This the following week. And the
[1:24:44] following week when I came back, I said,
[1:24:46] "You had Elijah, you had Elysia, you had
[1:24:49] John the You had John the Baptist." And
[1:24:51] I said, um, Elijah got to come back back
[1:24:54] in Revelations over in Revelations 11.
[1:24:56] So he got around, he kept talking. One
[1:24:59] of the fellow, you kind of the wisdom
[1:25:00] come from God. It don't come from man.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; So you got around there and and wait. So
[1:25:05] when we got over there at the Leo dea,
[1:25:08] we got around. He said, wait a minute.
[1:25:10] You said it was five.
[1:25:13] I said, "Here we go." He got around in
[1:25:16] there. Brother Steve, I I had I had that
[1:25:18] picture in my Bible, right? I had that
[1:25:20] picture right in my Bible. So when we
[1:25:22] got around there, I says, "Will you
[1:25:24] marry and Brandham?"
[1:25:27] Fer said, "Who?" I said, "William Marian
[1:25:30] Brandom."
[1:25:32] He says, "Uh,
[1:25:34] Fer says, William Mary," he says, "I
[1:25:38] never heard of him." I said, "Uh,
[1:25:42] I looked to the president. I said, "Is
[1:25:43] it all right if I pass this picture
[1:25:45] around?" He said, "Yeah." He says, "Go
[1:25:47] ahead." And I passed the picture around
[1:25:50] and one of the fellas sitting at the
[1:25:52] table said, "I heard of him before."
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; We ain't finished with their testimonies
[1:25:58] yet. Now, you got to remember when
[1:26:01] you're in those institutions
[1:26:03] like that, they do a lot of digging.
[1:26:06] They do a lot of studying. They go
[1:26:09] Hebrew. They do a lot of Greek. But
[1:26:11] that's why we say tonight, inspiration
[1:26:14] by revelation.
[1:26:16] They got a bunch of information, but
[1:26:19] it's not revelation.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; You got to have them there.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; I took my paper. Pastor, can I use your
[1:26:26] board?
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Ah,
[1:26:29] let me let me show you. Let me show you.
[1:26:31] Simple to us, powerful to them, right?
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; I got over that.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; All right, man.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:26:50] That's okay.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Good. Perfect.
[1:26:59] [Applause]
[1:27:01] [Music]
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:22] I said I got to ask you a question.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; I said I got to ask you a question.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; I said the seventh messenger, right?
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:35] I said, "What's the number seven?"
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; How many letters in each one of them
[1:27:41] name?
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; I said, "What's perfection?" He said,
[1:27:49] "Three." I said, "How many names are
[1:27:51] there?"
[1:27:53] [Applause]
[1:28:03] Is that right?
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Separate them. Is that right?
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, forgive me out there in in land. I
[1:28:08] forgot to grab my mic. Huh?
[1:28:11] Simple to us,
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; huh? However, for it's it's powerful
[1:28:16] because it shook their minds. Now they
[1:28:18] got to thinking.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Okay. Because when I go minister to him
[1:28:22] about the messenger of the hour, I said,
[1:28:24] "Well, you got to go look at Malachi 4,
[1:28:26] Luke 17:30, Revelations 10:7,
[1:28:28] Revelations 22." I said, "Go dig." See,
[1:28:30] they going to dig in the scriptures,
[1:28:32] right? But there no revelation. Is that
[1:28:34] right? Because a man got to be born
[1:28:36] again. That's why you got to understand
[1:28:38] when a man is out there being born
[1:28:40] again. See, they're not going to even
[1:28:42] receive it until you're born again. Is
[1:28:43] that right?
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; So, you got to understand, unless you
[1:28:47] born again, uh, it's just an intellect.
[1:28:49] It's just a mind thing to him. Is that
[1:28:51] right?
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; Let me keep going. Hallelujah.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; Look what God says. We're talking We
[1:28:57] talking about inspiration. The word of
[1:28:59] God by inspiration. He says he gave that
[1:29:03] will take us from Eden to the rapture.
[1:29:06] What is it?
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; It's the word.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; It's the word.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; That's what defeats Satan.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; He said it's the word. It'll defeat him
[1:29:16] anywhere, any place. He says, "Now why
[1:29:19] do we want to substitute something else
[1:29:23] when we already got the best thing that
[1:29:26] there is the word?"
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Look what he says.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; He says, "And we see Jesus on earth just
[1:29:34] to prove this was the best equipment
[1:29:37] when Satan came to Jesus." Is that
[1:29:40] right? We know. What did Jesus say? It
[1:29:43] is what?
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Written. It is what? Written. It is
[1:29:47] what? Written. Because why? He was God
[1:29:50] manifested in the flesh. Is that right?
[1:29:53] So being God manifested in the flesh. Uh
[1:29:57] Satan didn't know he was coming up
[1:29:58] against God. Uh then Jesus finally asked
[1:30:01] me, he said, "You come to try to attempt
[1:30:04] tempt the Lord thy God." Huh? Jesus knew
[1:30:08] who he was. Is that right? You got to
[1:30:11] know who you are now. When the devil
[1:30:13] come at you with something that's not of
[1:30:15] God, you got to know who you are. Shoot
[1:30:18] it down, saints. Shoot it back at him.
[1:30:20] Is that right? Speak the word by faith.
[1:30:23] Huh? Huh?
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Let me keep going. The Lord help me.
[1:30:29] Look what we got here. Hallelujah. He
[1:30:32] said Jesus, he came to him. Hallelujah.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; He said, "It is written." Uh-huh.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; And he punched him right out of the
[1:30:44] ring.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; Jesus did not play with the devil.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's like a man say the
[1:30:56] other day. That's why I say you were
[1:30:58] sinners, brother. We were used to when
[1:31:00] God brought us back.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Huh? I thought about he said that punch
[1:31:04] when brother Brandham when he was a
[1:31:06] prize fighter.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Huh? When he's a prize fighter at 15 on
[1:31:10] professional fights. Is that right? He
[1:31:12] said when the guy came on him, he said
[1:31:14] when the guy came came at him and said,
[1:31:17] "Bill, you look like a Baptist
[1:31:20] preacher." What did he say? He said, "I
[1:31:22] was about to jump all over him." He said
[1:31:25] he better say that with a smile. Is that
[1:31:27] right? Huh? You going to tell me he was
[1:31:30] saved then? No. He was a sinner. Yes,
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Look what he says.
[1:31:39] Help me, Lord.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He said, "Now it takes us
[1:31:42] there." He said, "It's written." He
[1:31:44] said, he punched him right out of the
[1:31:47] ring with it. That's right. Because it's
[1:31:49] God's best.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; He said, "You see, it's God's best. You
[1:31:55] got You're God's best. You got the word
[1:31:57] inside of you."
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; He says, "And look where it is. It's not
[1:32:03] just for one or two in the church. It's
[1:32:07] for every one of us." Amen.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Every one of us.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Every believer.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; You don't come in here and let Satan
[1:32:17] mess with your mind. Huh? Well, we were
[1:32:20] talking about the other day, Benjamin.
[1:32:21] Cast down what? Every imagination that
[1:32:25] tried to exalt itself against the word
[1:32:27] of God. Is that right? Destroy it. Is
[1:32:30] that right? Shoot it back at him. He
[1:32:32] said, "We wrestle not against what?
[1:32:34] Flesh and blood. The weapons of our
[1:32:36] warfare are not what? carninal. He did
[1:32:39] not tell he he did not tell the
[1:32:41] Corinthians what the weapons was. Is
[1:32:43] that right? He did not tell them, but he
[1:32:46] told Ephesians church what the weapons
[1:32:48] was. Is that right? Because they were
[1:32:51] more mature. You're getting more because
[1:32:53] you're more mature. You're his bride.
[1:32:56] God know you can handle it. His word
[1:32:58] does not go out void.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord. Yeah.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "And look where look where it
[1:33:06] is." He says, "Every believer has a
[1:33:09] right to take to take this word and
[1:33:12] fight the enemy
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; anywhere you meet him."
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; He says, "Anywhere you meet the enemy,
[1:33:19] he said this word is what you have to
[1:33:21] use." And Jesus proves proved that when
[1:33:25] he come, he he equipped his children
[1:33:28] with the word,
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; their protection against the enemy.
[1:33:33] Children, you understand what your
[1:33:34] protection is against the enemy?
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; The word.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; It's the word.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Just speak the word. Keep the word.
[1:33:41] David said, I hid the word in thy heart
[1:33:44] so I may not sin against thee.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; Look what he says.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says when he says and when all
[1:33:51] out warfare comes and the battle set in
[1:33:54] the ray and there is only one thing a
[1:33:57] real soldier can use a real Christian
[1:34:01] soldier that's thus say the Lord he said
[1:34:04] walk right out there and meet the enemy
[1:34:07] with the assurance that what nothing
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; thousand fall at the right at the left
[1:34:14] he said but won't come thee just
[1:34:17] Remember that God made this statement
[1:34:21] and give this to his children and it's
[1:34:25] the best that it's the best that's ever
[1:34:28] been yet.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; He says Satan in Eden when he first come
[1:34:34] to these attacks to attack a person
[1:34:37] knowing the children of God was
[1:34:40] fortified with this word.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; See, Satan attacks the word.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; He attacks the word.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; He says he never attacked the being. He
[1:34:54] attacked the word first.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; You see he slow he swed a seed of what?
[1:35:00] Of discrepancy.
[1:35:02] He says so Satan tried to attack the
[1:35:05] word in the garden. So he had to have
[1:35:08] something now that he could use the
[1:35:12] human beings. And now remember what did
[1:35:14] he use? He used reasoning.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; He tried to come with reasoning.
[1:35:21] Now you got to be careful because you
[1:35:23] got individuals. If you're getting a
[1:35:26] word and the word of God is telling you
[1:35:28] not to do something, then what someone
[1:35:32] come along and says, uh, well, you know,
[1:35:34] it's no harm in doing that. Uh, God
[1:35:37] didn't just mean that.Uh, come on. You
[1:35:39] know, uh, you know, our church does
[1:35:41] this. Uh, our church does that.
[1:35:44] We go to these things here, you know.
[1:35:47] Oh, that's just your church. Uh, what is
[1:35:49] he trying to get you to do? Is reason.
[1:35:52] Is that right? Oh, we know. You'll be
[1:35:54] just like God. Eve, is that right?
[1:35:58] You'll know the things that God would
[1:36:00] know. Huh? Eve stopped and listened. Is
[1:36:03] that right? She should have never
[1:36:05] stopped and listened to it. He should
[1:36:07] have shot her right back at him. Is that
[1:36:09] right? Thus say the Lord. God said,
[1:36:11] "Touch not the tree of knowledge of good
[1:36:14] and evil." Is that right? That's what he
[1:36:17] said. God meant what he said. That's
[1:36:19] your protection. That's what your
[1:36:21] fortress is. That's your your fortified.
[1:36:24] You're fortified by the word of God.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; He says, "Now look, I'mma jump here
[1:36:30] some. Help me, Lord.
[1:36:33] You got to understand that in this hour
[1:36:36] here now, we're talking about the word
[1:36:40] being fortified.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; By inspiration.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; It was certain ones that caught the word
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; by inspiration.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; If you catch the word by inspiration,
[1:36:55] then that's God speaking to your soul.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. Now once you catch
[1:37:00] the word by inspiration,
[1:37:03] you're moved by inspiration.
[1:37:06] Is that right? And now once you go there
[1:37:09] and if is inspired by God, uh God will
[1:37:13] manifest it. Uh it will happen. Is that
[1:37:16] right? It's because you're moving by the
[1:37:18] inspiration of God. Is that right? The
[1:37:21] Matthew 16:16,
[1:37:23] he said, Peter, who do them say that I
[1:37:26] am? Uh, some say you're Elijah. Some say
[1:37:29] you're John the Baptist. Some say you're
[1:37:31] Jeremiah. Peter, who did I say that I
[1:37:34] am? Uh, some say you're one of the
[1:37:36] prophets. But Peter, by inspiration,
[1:37:39] I'll read a quote to you in a minute cuz
[1:37:42] I know you message theologians. You I
[1:37:44] got to show you that. And I got to show
[1:37:45] you that in the quote there because you
[1:37:48] look at it the letter. If you take that
[1:37:50] letter, is that right? He go around
[1:37:52] there. He say inspiration. Is that
[1:37:54] right? He said what? Uh Peter said Peter
[1:37:58] answered and said what? He caught the
[1:38:00] inspiration of God. Is that right? He
[1:38:04] said he said Peter he said thou art the
[1:38:07] what? The Christ the son of the living
[1:38:10] God. Uh he says uh Peter flesh and blood
[1:38:14] this was not revealed to unto you. This
[1:38:16] only could have been revealed to you by
[1:38:19] my father. He said, "Peter, which upon
[1:38:22] this rock, uh, I'll build my church, and
[1:38:25] the gates of hell shall not prevail
[1:38:27] against it." Peter caught the
[1:38:29] inspiration. All right. Revelation. He
[1:38:33] caught a hold of it and said, "What is
[1:38:35] the building?" He built the revelation
[1:38:37] is what? Upon the revelation of the word
[1:38:41] who Jesus Christ is. Is that right? And
[1:38:45] Jesus agreed that Peter Revelation was
[1:38:49] right.
[1:38:51] Come on now. We got the inspiration.
[1:38:54] Remember the widow woman there in Kings.
[1:38:57] Remember Elijah? She didn't have a
[1:38:59] child. Uh and she didn't have a child.
[1:39:02] Uh when she got over there, she said her
[1:39:04] husal to her husband and asked her
[1:39:06] husband if she would but this is a man
[1:39:10] of God. Uh with this get this man of
[1:39:12] God. this man of God. Uh, could we give
[1:39:14] him a place to stay there when he come
[1:39:16] by and he can rest? Uh, then he said,
[1:39:19] "You know what? Ask him and see if we
[1:39:21] can do what? Even if we could put a bed
[1:39:23] back there, honey, we could put a bed
[1:39:25] for him. Then we could come and he can
[1:39:27] rest." Uh, so that Judomite woman there,
[1:39:30] right? She knew that Elijah was coming
[1:39:32] by. Is that right? So Elijah did what?
[1:39:35] By inspiration, he wanted to bless the
[1:39:38] lady. Someone told Elijah that she
[1:39:41] didn't have a child. Is that right? So
[1:39:43] Elijah know a woman without a child is a
[1:39:46] reproach. Is that right? But you know
[1:39:49] God said in this hour here you should
[1:39:52] not be born or unfruitful. Right?
[1:39:55] Manifest confess your child. Uh testify
[1:39:58] your child. Uh get that baby room ready.
[1:40:02] Start painting that room. Uh got paint
[1:40:04] that room. Is that right? Buy the
[1:40:07] clothes that you want for them. Is that
[1:40:09] right? confessing, speaking. When you
[1:40:12] catch the inspiration, that baby's
[1:40:15] coming. It's coming. When you catch the
[1:40:18] inspiration of that child, uh, I'm
[1:40:21] bringing you a word and showing you
[1:40:23] what's happening. Is that right? He got
[1:40:25] to be under the inspiration. So, we got
[1:40:27] there and then the baby, right? He was
[1:40:30] out there plowing, working with his
[1:40:32] daddy. And he was out there working with
[1:40:34] his daddy and then he died. Is that
[1:40:36] right? And when the baby cut maybe a
[1:40:38] heat stroke or something, but when he
[1:40:40] got there and he died, is that right?
[1:40:43] And he got over there, but under the
[1:40:45] inspiration. Is that right? She wasn't
[1:40:48] even there, brother. She wasn't even He
[1:40:51] wasn't even there. Elijah wasn't even
[1:40:54] there. She caught the inspiration,
[1:40:57] took the baby, picked him up, uh laid
[1:41:00] him on Elijah's bed. Is that right? Is
[1:41:03] that right? Is that right? And when she
[1:41:05] laid him on the bed of Elijah, then when
[1:41:08] Elijah came, is that right? She knew all
[1:41:10] I had to get him to is the message of
[1:41:13] the hour.
[1:41:17] If I can get him to the message of the
[1:41:18] hour because it's a double portion. It's
[1:41:21] an anointing on that word. Uh it's the
[1:41:24] second oil that God bring back to him.
[1:41:26] It's an anointing like it's never been
[1:41:28] before. Whatever you need, you can ask
[1:41:31] for. Just confess the word. Uh
[1:41:34] [Applause]
[1:41:35] Look what she said. Uh when Elijah came
[1:41:38] uh once he came there and he said that
[1:41:41] pastor uh you know the baby was around
[1:41:43] there dead. Uh but not only was he
[1:41:45] anointed everything that he touched was
[1:41:48] anointed. We know. Is that right?
[1:41:50] Because God said I am commissioned to
[1:41:53] bless you. Is that right? I'm commanded
[1:41:55] to bless you. Is that right? So we got
[1:41:58] to understand this. When he got over
[1:42:00] there, he laid on that baby and breathed
[1:42:02] on that baby seven times. Is that right?
[1:42:05] And when he breathed on that baby, the
[1:42:07] baby came back alive. Is that right? But
[1:42:09] she caught it by the what? Inspiration.
[1:42:13] Is that right? We were talking about
[1:42:15] there with Moses. Is that right? Not
[1:42:17] Moses, I mean Joel. Is that right? Joel
[1:42:20] caught the inspiration. When Joel caught
[1:42:23] the inspiration, it was a dark time. Is
[1:42:25] that right? He said, "What? The palmer
[1:42:27] worm, the canker worm, the caterpillar,
[1:42:30] the locust was eaten up. Is that right?
[1:42:32] He caught the inspiration way back up in
[1:42:35] the ages. Is that right? Joel saw it. Is
[1:42:38] that right? But God then later on came
[1:42:40] and did what? Broke it through the
[1:42:42] seventh messenger. Is that right? When
[1:42:44] he came with the seven messenger, he
[1:42:46] said what? He said what? The pomme worm,
[1:42:49] the cankerworm, the caterpillar, the
[1:42:51] locust have eaten up. He said I what
[1:42:54] shall restore. Is that right? I shall
[1:42:57] restore what the Catholic Church have
[1:42:59] eaten up. What the Baptist? What the
[1:43:01] Methodist? What the Lutheran? I shall
[1:43:03] restore the word back. Is that right?
[1:43:06] Why? Uh because I gave you my atomic
[1:43:08] bomb. Uh I gave you the best thing that
[1:43:11] I can. Uh I gave you myself. Is that
[1:43:13] right? The anointing is on the
[1:43:15] inspiration. The inspiration comes uh
[1:43:18] when it comes at the right season.
[1:43:20] That's why he was saying it got to be a
[1:43:22] what? Time. It's a season and a purpose.
[1:43:26] It's a time. It's a season. It's a
[1:43:29] purpose. It's now down the season to get
[1:43:31] what you need to get, saints. This is
[1:43:34] the season. God wouldn't unfold it. It's
[1:43:37] time to grab it. Call what you need,
[1:43:39] saints. Uh don't back up now. Uh come
[1:43:42] through that door. Get your mind set. Uh
[1:43:45] don't get weary. It's Wednesday night.
[1:43:47] Uh God brought you here. God's going to
[1:43:50] grant you what you come expecting. Speak
[1:43:52] the word. Uh, confess it, saints. Uh,
[1:43:55] don't give up now. Fight the good fight
[1:43:58] of faith. I press to the mark of the
[1:44:00] pride of the high calling. Is that
[1:44:02] right? Let's look at Huh. Let's look at
[1:44:04] Zapora. I'm going to show you this
[1:44:06] Zapora. He called it what brother
[1:44:08] Brandham said about it. Let's go to
[1:44:10] Exodus 4.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:44:21] It's the season, pastor.
[1:44:24] It's the season.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; Keep on reading. Keep on doing what
[1:44:27] you're doing. Hallelujah.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; It's going to get sweeter and sweeter.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; I'm going to show you what that
[1:44:36] scripture when he said when the enemy
[1:44:38] come in like a flood.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; Huh? When That's right. He raised the
[1:44:43] spirit of the Lord raises up a standard.
[1:44:47] We going to show you what the standard
[1:44:48] is in a minute.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; That's why he's giving what he's giving
[1:44:54] you, pastor. We got to have somebody
[1:44:57] that he's going to use in this end time
[1:45:00] to fulfill his scripture.

[1:45:19] in here talking about no war. Huh? I'm a
[1:45:22] warrior from my youth. Huh?
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; What are you talking about? We've been
[1:45:30] trained for this. Is that right? You

[1:45:59] don't put his people there. Was not
[1:46:01] David out there in the wilderness with
[1:46:02] that lion and that bear? Huh? You don't
[1:46:05] know. Each and every one of you got your
[1:46:07] testimony. God trained you for what you
[1:46:10] went through. God saw you what you going
[1:46:12] through. God brought you through what
[1:46:14] you went through. That's why he did.
[1:46:16] Huh? You think Sister Lorel just cooked
[1:46:18] like the way she cooked? God brought her

[1:46:41] Look what he says for the sake of time.
[1:46:44] Exodus 4. Let's look at verse uh
[1:46:48] let let's look at verse 18. You ready?
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; He says, "And Moses went and return to
[1:46:53] Jethro, his father-in-law." He says,
[1:46:55] "And said unto him, let me go pray thee
[1:46:58] return to my brethren there in Egypt,
[1:47:01] and see whether they be yet alive." And
[1:47:05] Jethro said to Moses, "Go in peace." And
[1:47:08] the Lord said unto unto Moses and
[1:47:10] Midian, "Go return in Egypt, for all the
[1:47:14] men are dead which sought thy life." He
[1:47:16] says, "And Moses took his wife and his
[1:47:19] son and set them upon an ass." He says,
[1:47:21] "And he returned to the land of Egypt.
[1:47:24] And Moses took the rod of the rod of
[1:47:27] who?"
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; The rod of who?
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; If they could have got that rod out of
[1:47:31] his hand.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Ah. Ah,
[1:47:35] God h in simplicity and revealed the
[1:47:39] same.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; Look what he says.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; He turned around and help me Lord. He
[1:47:47] said in his hand. He said, "Now I tell
[1:47:49] you this here." See, because the hand is
[1:47:51] the power of God. Is that right?
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me keep going. Help me,
[1:47:56] Lord. He Thank you, brother. He says,
[1:47:59] "And the Lord said unto Moses, when thou
[1:48:01] knowest to return unto Egypt, see that
[1:48:04] thou do all these wonders before
[1:48:07] Pharaoh, which I have put in thy thy
[1:48:09] hand, but I will harden his heart, that
[1:48:12] he shall not let what?"
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; Let the people go, and thou shalt say
[1:48:18] unto Pharaoh, "Thus sayeth the Lord,
[1:48:20] Israel is my son, even my firstborn. And
[1:48:23] I say unto thee, let my what? son, go
[1:48:27] and he may serve me. And if thou refuse
[1:48:30] to let go, behold, I will slay thy what?
[1:48:33] Son, he says, and even thy firstborn. He
[1:48:36] says, and it came to pass by the way in
[1:48:39] the end that the Lord met him and sought
[1:48:42] to do what?
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; Uhoh,
[1:48:46] here comes Sapora.
[1:48:49] Here she come. Then Sapora took a what?
[1:48:53] sharp stone and cut off the foreskin of
[1:48:56] her son and cast it at his feet and said
[1:49:00] surely a what
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; the husband art thou now what
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; now you're ready to go forth you covered
[1:49:07] with the bloody gospel is that right now
[1:49:11] you can go forward is that right because
[1:49:13] it was a covenant brother Brandham said
[1:49:16] he said the covenant was you had to have
[1:49:18] circumcision he said a circumcision
[1:49:21] today is what the Holy Ghost Is that
[1:49:23] right? He said Moses got so caught up in
[1:49:26] his work. Uh Moses got so caught up in
[1:49:28] his intellect. Moses got so caught up in
[1:49:31] his religion. Moses wasn't taking care
[1:49:33] of God's work first. Is that right? He
[1:49:36] had to understand everything's by the
[1:49:38] blood. Uh Moses forgot that they had to
[1:49:41] have the blood on the doorpost and the
[1:49:43] ltho. Is that right? Before they came
[1:49:45] out of Egypt, it was part of the
[1:49:47] covenant. The blood. Is that right? They
[1:49:50] were getting about what? Preaching the
[1:49:52] Holy Ghost. Is that right? Uhoh.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; God meant a man got to be born again.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; You take that covenant.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; It's the bloody work. The covenant. He
[1:50:06] gave it to Abraham. Abraham had to have
[1:50:09] a covenant. You see, it had to be the
[1:50:11] gospel. We're going to show you in a
[1:50:12] minute. He showed the signs in the
[1:50:14] wonders. Put your hand in your bosom,
[1:50:15] Moses. Put your hand out of the bosom,
[1:50:17] Moses. Put your hand back, Moses. You
[1:50:19] got to have a clean and pure
[1:50:22] a pure heart and a clean hand. Right,
[1:50:24] Moses? To handle my word. Anybody can't
[1:50:26] handle my word, Moses. And then when he
[1:50:28] told him to go back, he says, "What?" He
[1:50:30] says, "Now, Moses, I'm showing you this
[1:50:32] gospel, this power in this gospel." If
[1:50:35] you go over to Genesis 12, Abram, Abram,
[1:50:37] he had to see the gospel, too. I'm
[1:50:39] getting somewhere in a minute. I'm going
[1:50:41] to show you what Brother Brandham said
[1:50:42] about it. It always was and it always
[1:50:45] will be the lead of man unto salvation.
[1:50:48] Now you're ready to go in and pull a man
[1:50:50] out. Bear with me. Huh?
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:56] Look what he said. Help me, Lord. He
[1:50:58] said, now look.
[1:51:00] Thank you, Jesus. He says, "And it came
[1:51:02] to pass by the way in the end." He says,
[1:51:04] "And Lord met him and sought to kill
[1:51:07] him." And Zenapor, he said, verse 26,
[1:51:10] "So he let him go. Then she said, a
[1:51:13] bloody husband thou art because of the
[1:51:16] what? circumcision
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; of the circumcision. Remember that was a
[1:51:20] covenant,
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; It was a covenant that he had to keep.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; But he was going down to Egypt to
[1:51:25] deliver him, but he hadn't kept all the
[1:51:28] word yet.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; You see, and brother and brother
[1:51:31] Brandham said it was his intellect and
[1:51:33] he got caught up in those things. You
[1:51:35] can go back and look at the quote. The
[1:51:36] pastor pull it up for you. I'm jumping a
[1:51:39] little bit. Help me, Lord. He said, "Now
[1:51:41] look, I want you to see something here.
[1:51:43] the the the uh uh inspiration. Turn to
[1:51:47] uh God help me. Yeah. Turn to uh Matthew
[1:51:51] 16. I want to read it to you. Matthew
[1:51:54] 16.
[1:51:55] I want to help me Lord. He said now
[1:51:59] Matthew 16 is in here ye him.
[1:52:04] He in here hear ye him. And just look at
[1:52:06] the verse 13. You'll see what I was
[1:52:08] saying about there with u um Peter. He
[1:52:11] said look now. He said some of these
[1:52:13] things uh 93056.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; We got paragraph 18. I'mma jump around
[1:52:21] now. So y'all write it down if you can't
[1:52:23] keep up. Oh sometimes the cost of a a
[1:52:26] price to really say sometime it causes
[1:52:28] separation from whom? Sometime it cause
[1:52:31] separation from churches. Sometime it
[1:52:33] cause separation from lodges in all
[1:52:36] walks of life. Sometimes between husband
[1:52:38] and wife to really speak out. He said,
[1:52:41] "But I I like Peter." He's made a lot of
[1:52:44] mistakes. I have He said, "But this one
[1:52:47] time, he was really inspired."
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; He said, "Yes." He stood up quickly and
[1:52:53] said, "Thou art Christ, the son of the
[1:52:55] living God." He said, "What a statement.
[1:52:58] Thou art the Christ, the son of the
[1:53:00] living God." Who was the Christ? Uh he
[1:53:02] was the son of God and he was the
[1:53:04] Messiah. He was the son of God and he
[1:53:06] was God in the flesh. Is that right? Let
[1:53:08] us keep going. is that's help me Lord.
[1:53:11] He said blessed yes blessed art thou
[1:53:13] Simon Barjonah for flesh and blood has
[1:53:15] not what revealed this to on you. He
[1:53:17] said but upon this rock I'll build my
[1:53:20] church and the gates of hell to prevail
[1:53:22] against it. He said there he said there
[1:53:24] you are.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; He said inspiration
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; inspired the revelation.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; He says oh how he was inspired. He says,
[1:53:37] "Standing there in front of the Messiah
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; on Sundays when you come in there,
[1:53:46] you're standing there in the presence of
[1:53:49] God." When you're standing there in the
[1:53:51] presence of God, uh, you think it's just
[1:53:54] a man. Some go out and say, "My pastor."
[1:53:57] Some go out and say, "Brother Stephen."
[1:54:00] Some, but what do they say? Do they say
[1:54:03] the Lord? Let me tell you what the Lord
[1:54:05] told us today. Is that right? Let me
[1:54:08] tell you what the Holy Ghost has told us
[1:54:10] today. No man can interpret those
[1:54:12] things. It takes the Holy Ghost. Is that
[1:54:15] right? How can you tie a thing with a
[1:54:18] with a season? With a season, right? How
[1:54:21] can you tie a a thing with a season?
[1:54:24] Things is tied in with a season that's
[1:54:26] hidden that scripture for years. It was
[1:54:28] hidden in there.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; Come on, man. It's God. He's letting you
[1:54:32] know you in his presence
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; under the inspiration. You can get what
[1:54:38] you come expecting.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; You coming in just believe it's just
[1:54:42] church. But then I h forgive me sister
[1:54:44] Eden. When we come around in there,
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; let me slow down a little bit.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; You come in the house of the Lord. You
[1:54:53] got to understand about get me stirred
[1:54:56] up. I ain't even I'm just a third of the
[1:54:58] way finished. Let me keep going. I told
[1:55:00] you he missed the quote Sunday. I got
[1:55:02] him. He said, "Now look."
[1:55:06] He said, "Look," he said, "It's the
[1:55:08] Messiah, thou the Christ." He said,
[1:55:10] "Flesh and blood has not revealed this
[1:55:12] unto you." Look what he said. He said,
[1:55:14] "What is it?"
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; It's upon inspiration.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; You see it upon inspiration of the Lord
[1:55:23] Jesus Christ through his word.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; That's right. He said, he says, "I will
[1:55:28] build my church and the gates of hell
[1:55:29] will not prevail against it." Look at
[1:55:31] this here now. He says, "Though it shows
[1:55:35] all the gates of hell will be against
[1:55:37] it, but they cannot prevail.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; No matter what's coming against us, you
[1:55:44] just keep saying all is well.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; All is well
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; is working for our good.
[1:55:55] All is well.
[1:55:57] All is well
[1:56:00] because we know the beginning to the
[1:56:02] end. All is well.
[1:56:06] He said God said, look at his hair. He
[1:56:09] said God said when the enemy comes in
[1:56:11] like a what?
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; I will do what? Raise up a standard
[1:56:16] against it. What he say, brother Kha?
[1:56:19] He's the spirit. Look, he says, God
[1:56:21] says, I will raise up a standing against
[1:56:24] it, God will do it.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; He said, look, and when all the gates,
[1:56:31] when all the gates torment is pressing
[1:56:34] against that little church, he said, yet
[1:56:38] it will never prevail against us. It's
[1:56:41] not going to prevail against us. It's
[1:56:43] only pushing us to our purpose. It's
[1:56:46] only pushing us to what God put us here
[1:56:48] for. Is that right? You got a reason,
[1:56:50] you got a season, you got your time, and
[1:56:53] you got your purpose. Is that right? So,
[1:56:55] he's pushing us to our purpose. We
[1:56:58] cannot leave here for our purpose.
[1:56:59] That's why I say, young ministers, what
[1:57:02] God put in you, you got to do it. Just
[1:57:05] do it. Is that right? Don't try to
[1:57:07] imitate anyone else. If you imitate
[1:57:10] somebody else, then you're not you're
[1:57:13] not letting God supply to his people
[1:57:16] what he needs. I got the quote here. I
[1:57:18] don't know if we have a time. I'll read
[1:57:19] it to you so you just what the prophet
[1:57:22] said. Okay, look what he says here.
[1:57:24] Hallelujah. He says he'll raise up a
[1:57:27] what?
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; A standard against it. He said just he
[1:57:31] says I think the disciples in the early
[1:57:33] days when there were just a little
[1:57:36] handful of people, he said with no
[1:57:38] education, no ability, he said no
[1:57:41] degree, they had no determination behind
[1:57:43] them. They had nothing but one thing.
[1:57:47] and that was the Holy Spirit. They had
[1:57:50] received the day of Pentecost. They
[1:57:52] didn't need more for God had already
[1:57:55] said upon this inspiration,
[1:57:58] I will build my church. Uh that's what
[1:58:01] he's telling them. Look, what is that?
[1:58:03] When the enemy come in like a flood,
[1:58:05] remember God said his word, he's alpha
[1:58:09] and omega, the beginning and the end and
[1:58:12] the first and the last. When the enemy
[1:58:16] came in, at every age, you still with
[1:58:19] me? Every age. When he came in, he
[1:58:21] raised up a standard. He raised a
[1:58:23] standard by his word. Uh when he got
[1:58:26] Paul, is that right? After Paul came,
[1:58:29] then he had Iranius. Then after Ianius
[1:58:32] came, then he got Columbus. Then after
[1:58:34] Columbus came, he got Martin. Then after
[1:58:37] Martin came, he had Luther. Then after
[1:58:40] Luther came, he had Wesley. Then at the
[1:58:42] Wesley came, he had the Pentecostal.
[1:58:45] Then after the past, the restoration of
[1:58:47] the gift of the Holy Ghost. Now he's got
[1:58:49] the what? He's got the bride. He always
[1:58:53] raises a standard against it. God does
[1:58:55] not refortify anything. God just raise
[1:59:00] another standard.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; First seal. First seal.
[1:59:11] riding. He come on a white horse. First
[1:59:15] seal riding on a white horse down there.
[1:59:20] Oh, look, man. Did you see that? You see
[1:59:22] that, man? He got a bow and no arrow. He
[1:59:26] got a bow and no arrow. Brother, tell
[1:59:29] everybody superficial revelation.
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:59:39] got right around in there. He said he
[1:59:42] got now it comes out of the thundersh
[1:59:47] come out of there. What was it? Is that
[1:59:51] right?
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; He came down there now. It was the
[1:59:54] antichrist
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; and it revealed that the antichrist.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Oh, they caught it. Now
[2:00:02] we're bringing it up to our day in the
[2:00:04] message. Is that right? We came in the
[2:00:07] house of the Lord together. We took
[2:00:08] sweet counsel together. Luther came. Is
[2:00:11] that right? When they came in Luther, is
[2:00:14] that right? It was a dark time. But
[2:00:16] Luther, he came, he pulled away from the
[2:00:18] Catholic Church. And he said, "The just
[2:00:20] shall live by what? Faith." Is that
[2:00:22] right? It was almost dead. It was almost
[2:00:24] gone. Is that right? Then he had to come
[2:00:27] with Wesley. But when he came in, what?
[2:00:29] When he came in Wesley, I mean when he
[2:00:31] came in Lutheran's time, he showed the
[2:00:34] bride. She never did it. Is that right?
[2:00:36] She never did. Is she not guilty? Is
[2:00:38] that right? Then it came around in
[2:00:40] Wesley's time. Then it came in what?
[2:00:43] Pentecostal time. Is that right?
[2:00:45] Pentecostal at the restoration of the
[2:00:47] gift. When the restorations of the gifts
[2:00:49] came. Is that right? Then what happened?
[2:00:52] Let me tell you something, saints. You
[2:00:54] don't have to be afraid. If you got a
[2:00:56] gift, God given us a word to examine if
[2:00:59] it's true or if it's false. Get yourself
[2:01:03] out of the way and let God use you. Is
[2:01:06] that right? Let him use you the way he
[2:01:09] put you here to do it. God will
[2:01:11] vindicate it. Because Jesus said at the
[2:01:15] well, is that right? When he came at the
[2:01:17] well, Jesus came and he told him, I
[2:01:20] mean, not at the well, forgive me. When
[2:01:21] he came there, met John the Baptist. And
[2:01:24] he met John the Baptist down there. And
[2:01:26] John the Baptist came to Jesus. He said,
[2:01:28] "Behold the lamb of God come to take
[2:01:31] away the sin of the world." Is that
[2:01:33] right? Brother Brandham said when he met
[2:01:35] them and he says, "I need to be baptized
[2:01:38] of you. I don't need you to be baptized
[2:01:40] of me." He said, Jesus said, "All
[2:01:43] righteousness must be fulfilled." Is
[2:01:46] that right? He said, "Every promise in
[2:01:49] that Bible will be fulfilled in this
[2:01:53] age." Is that right? like it or not, the
[2:01:56] gifts were sent to keep the church
[2:01:58] clean. Is that right? That's God's
[2:02:01] order. The Holy Ghost leads and guides
[2:02:04] us into all truth. Uh we're talking
[2:02:06] about inspiration by revelation. First
[2:02:10] time uh that a man God had ever put foot
[2:02:13] on this earth again. Is that right? The
[2:02:16] prophet of God met God at the river. Is
[2:02:19] that right? John the Baptist introduced
[2:02:21] him. Is that right? So we come and we
[2:02:24] talking about superficial revelation. Is
[2:02:26] that right? So you had to have the
[2:02:29] second oil. Is that right? When he came
[2:02:31] and he brought them the second oil and
[2:02:33] that oil that was there and he said they
[2:02:35] took they had no oil in their vessels.
[2:02:38] Is that right? And in their lamps. Is
[2:02:40] that right? He typed that thing in his
[2:02:42] age here now. They're not having the
[2:02:44] Holy Ghost. Is that right? They needed
[2:02:47] the Holy Ghost in his age here now.
[2:02:49] We're talking about the hidden things.
[2:02:51] We're talking about inspiration of God.
[2:02:54] Is that right? We're talking about
[2:02:56] Joshua, Joshua 3, Joshua 4. Remember,
[2:03:00] they was going over Jordan. Is that
[2:03:02] right? Once they was going over Jordan,
[2:03:04] that's why you got this interpretation.
[2:03:06] That's why you got that interpretation.
[2:03:09] God didn't tell Joshua to take two sets
[2:03:11] of stones. He said one sets of stone. Is
[2:03:14] that right? Joshua took another set of
[2:03:16] stones. When Joshua took the other sets
[2:03:19] of stones, Joshua knew that it was going
[2:03:22] to be some foolishness. Uh, and so
[2:03:24] Joshua put those stones in the middle of
[2:03:26] Jordan. Is that right? So he got there
[2:03:29] in the middle of Jordan. That's right.
[2:03:31] And when the river came up, is that
[2:03:32] right? The right interpretation, the
[2:03:35] right revelation had to come when the
[2:03:38] seventh angel came. And that
[2:03:40] interpretation came, it was the middle
[2:03:42] of Jordan. Is that right? You had to die
[2:03:44] out to yourself. Uh, you got to get away
[2:03:46] from your thinking. You got a man
[2:03:48] sitting on the stone on the outside.
[2:03:51] Come on now. Now, but it was on the
[2:03:53] outside. Uh, the stones that was on the
[2:03:55] outside, uh, Baptist can change it.
[2:03:58] Methodists can change it. Lutheran can
[2:04:00] change it. Message people can change it.
[2:04:03] They can change it. Is that right? But,
[2:04:05] uh, you had to come. Why? Get a double
[2:04:08] portion in the second coming. What?
[2:04:10] Elisha. Elisha said what? They say we
[2:04:13] following a man. Is that right? They
[2:04:15] were the ones that's following the man.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; No, he's going to leave. Don't you,
[2:04:22] Charlie? He's going to leave, don't you?
[2:04:25] Elijah's getting ready there. I know it.
[2:04:27] Hold your peace. I know what I'm
[2:04:29] watching. He's going around in there. He
[2:04:31] said, I'm going with you. And I know
[2:04:32] what I'm watching. Elijah going to go
[2:04:34] there. Oh, don't you know Elijah's
[2:04:36] going? I know. I know. Hold your peace
[2:04:38] there. I'm not watching Elijah. I'm
[2:04:41] watching the spirit on Elijah.
[2:04:43] because I want a double portion when he
[2:04:45] leave. He said, "If you see me, all
[2:04:47] you're going to do is ask what you see
[2:04:49] me." Is that right? They had to cross
[2:04:51] over Jordan. Is that right? But the sons
[2:04:54] of the prophets,
[2:04:56] [Music]
[2:04:58] but the sons of the prophets, when they
[2:05:00] turned around in there, they got around
[2:05:02] and they don't know what's this. They
[2:05:04] don't know if this quote match this.
[2:05:05] They don't know if this quote go with
[2:05:07] this. They don't know if this scripture
[2:05:08] go with this quote. They don't know if
[2:05:10] this scripture go with that quote. Just
[2:05:12] say what the prophet said and God will
[2:05:14] inspire it.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; But you gotta believe. You gotta
[2:05:20] believe. You got to believe that that is
[2:05:22] the covenant messenger. You got to
[2:05:25] believe. He You got to believe over
[2:05:27] there. And we're at uh uh Revelations
[2:05:31] over in Revelations in the breach. Is
[2:05:33] that right? When you go over to
[2:05:34] Revelations in the breach, when you got
[2:05:36] there, when all of them was at the
[2:05:38] throne, first in Revelations 4, the four
[2:05:40] beasts was the what? It was the gospels.
[2:05:42] Is that right? Then the four beasts,
[2:05:44] they went over there. Now, when the
[2:05:46] preacher, they came down, the four
[2:05:47] beasts, and all them was around the
[2:05:49] throne, the 12 and 12, the 24 patriot,
[2:05:52] the 24 apostles. Is that right? And
[2:05:54] brother Brandham said the four beasts
[2:05:56] was the gospel. Is that right? He said
[2:05:58] that's what it was there. Hold it.
[2:06:01] Hallelujah. Some of you looking at me. I
[2:06:03] know you follow me. Hallelujah.
[2:06:06] Look what he says. Help me, Lord.
[2:06:10] He said, look. He said, now look. He
[2:06:14] said be. He said, now here's the four
[2:06:15] beasts of Revelation. This is 10657.
[2:06:19] 10657.
[2:06:20] He said, now the four beasts of
[2:06:22] Revelation. He said every place in in
[2:06:25] the Bible, the four beasts that the four
[2:06:27] faces, he said one face was like a man,
[2:06:30] the other face was like a ox, the other
[2:06:32] face was like an eagle, the other face
[2:06:35] was like a lion, and they never went
[2:06:37] backwards. They couldn't go backwards.
[2:06:40] They always went forward. That's the
[2:06:43] gospel. Let's keep going. He says now he
[2:06:47] says they look not go backwards but
[2:06:49] every way they went they were going
[2:06:52] forwards. He says if they went this way
[2:06:55] if they were going like a man it went
[2:06:57] this way it was going like a lion. If it
[2:07:00] went that way it was going like an
[2:07:02] eagle. If it went this way it was going
[2:07:05] like an ox. See they couldn't go
[2:07:07] backwards. They were going forward. Each
[2:07:10] time uh God every time the enemy come in
[2:07:14] like a flood, he raises his standard in
[2:07:17] the word. Uh he breaks the word. Uh
[2:07:20] that's what they don't like. Uh the
[2:07:22] revelation of the word. Uh let us keep
[2:07:24] going.
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; We ain't finished with you. We going to
[2:07:27] get back to that Jordan. I know just
[2:07:29] where I'm at. He said now those four
[2:07:31] beasts now too quickly this cuz I don't
[2:07:34] want to say I don't want to stay too
[2:07:36] long. He said the beast represents
[2:07:39] power. He said see and notice these
[2:07:42] beasts were not were not out yonder in
[2:07:46] the lake or in the sea somewhere. He
[2:07:48] said but at the throne of God. Is that
[2:07:52] right? They were at the throne of God.
[2:07:54] Uh now we're getting ready. He just
[2:07:56] passed what? The Patmas vision. Is that
[2:07:59] right? when he came into Revelations 1.
[2:08:01] If you go into Revelations 1 to go in
[2:08:03] the Patmas vision, that's all you got to
[2:08:05] do is go out there and catch a sinner.
[2:08:07] You want to catch a sinner? Brother
[2:08:08] Brandham broke down all that down there
[2:08:10] in the Patmas vision. He talked about
[2:08:13] the the the the baptism. He talked about
[2:08:16] being born again. Is that right? Right
[2:08:18] in the Patmas vision. That's how you can
[2:08:20] win a sinner. Is that right? Luke 19:10
[2:08:23] said the son of man came to seek those
[2:08:26] that was lost. Is that right? When you
[2:08:28] get them in there, take them religious
[2:08:30] demons in there, twist their minds up.
[2:08:32] They can't even catch a hold of what
[2:08:34] you're talking about. Uh, but I'm that
[2:08:36] Patmas vision. John was there. What? On
[2:08:39] the island of what? Patmas for the what?
[2:08:42] For the word of God and testimony and
[2:08:45] the testimony. The testimony because
[2:08:47] Jesus Christ backed them. He stood for
[2:08:50] him. What he was doing, he was
[2:08:52] vindicated him that the word is right.
[2:08:54] Saints, uh, move forward. Each day you
[2:08:57] get up, look for somebody to save. Take
[2:08:59] this gospel to bring the gospel to them.
[2:09:02] I'm growing you now.
[2:09:04] [Music]
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; Still back 10657
[2:09:10] paragraph.
[2:09:12] 686. He said, "Now look," he said, "Now
[2:09:16] those four beasts," he said it
[2:09:17] represents power. You notice the beasts
[2:09:20] were not a yonder in a lake or the sea
[2:09:22] somewhere. He said coming up. He said
[2:09:25] they were at the throne of God and they
[2:09:28] were worshiping God.
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; Let it sink in worshiping God. Oh my
[2:09:34] God. Get
[2:09:37] if you can give me just five minutes. 10
[2:09:38] minutes. 10 minutes. Okay. Hallelujah.
[2:09:41] I'm going have to jump. He said now he
[2:09:44] said the beast he he says to God help me
[2:09:47] Lord. The four those four beasts means
[2:09:51] four powers. He says that come up out of
[2:09:54] the earth. He says in those four powers,
[2:09:57] where's the four gospels? Matthew, Mark,
[2:10:00] Luke, and John. He says, and that is He
[2:10:02] says in the gospel, he said he says in
[2:10:05] the gospel goes forth as a what? As a
[2:10:08] lion. Still with me? It's stern. It's
[2:10:10] stern. And it's bold. He says the gospel
[2:10:13] is brave like a lion. He said you don't
[2:10:16] have to fear nothing, man. You look that
[2:10:18] devil right in his face. Uh when the
[2:10:20] doctor tell you there's no more he can
[2:10:21] do, he say, "Doc, uh I appreciate you,
[2:10:24] but you know what? I'll bring the
[2:10:26] testimony back to you. I know a God. I
[2:10:29] know a God that calms the river. I know
[2:10:31] a God that calms the storm. I know a God
[2:10:34] that's Jehovah Rafi. I know a God that
[2:10:37] can move mountains. I know a God. We got
[2:10:40] to move this hair." Uh you got to
[2:10:42] understand, uh it's time, pastor. Now
[2:10:45] it's time. Uh this is the dispensational
[2:10:47] time.
[2:10:48] You got to understand uh when that man
[2:10:50] remember I said it's the gospel the
[2:10:52] power is in the gospel. Brother Brandham
[2:10:54] said when he was in that meeting in
[2:10:56] Oregon and then that meeting there he
[2:10:58] said when that man came and honked up
[2:11:00] and spit in his face brother and then he
[2:11:02] turned around and what did he say? He
[2:11:04] said those preachers in there when he
[2:11:05] came up to there he said those preachers
[2:11:07] was there in the front. Uh soon as that
[2:11:10] man come they got scared. Is that right?
[2:11:12] Supposed to be the man of God and
[2:11:14] started scattered. Is that right? He
[2:11:15] said the man came up in there and he
[2:11:18] said when the man came there under the
[2:11:20] inspiration
[2:11:22] he got over that he said this day you're
[2:11:26] going to fall across my feet.
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; The man said brother Brandham said that
[2:11:31] was not him that was God.
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; He he said the man came up and
[2:11:36] challenged God.
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; He said he was they asked him was he
[2:11:40] dead? Uh he says he know. Uh he said
[2:11:43] what did that to him? Brother Brandham
[2:11:45] said it was the gospel that's what
[2:11:47] knocked him down on his feet. Come on
[2:11:49] saints. Uh you got to understand uh you
[2:11:52] bring him through them seals. Uh you can
[2:11:53] see the gospel in the seals. Uh you can
[2:11:56] see the gospels in the church ages. You
[2:11:58] can see the gospel in Patma's vision.
[2:12:00] You can see gospel in the breach. Uh the
[2:12:02] gospel is there. Is that right? He
[2:12:04] coming around in there. He says speak to
[2:12:07] this mountain. Brother Brandham had to
[2:12:09] move into his position and he said speak
[2:12:12] into this mountain. He said he looked at
[2:12:14] that scripture. He was a wise man. He
[2:12:17] never touched the scripture unless he
[2:12:19] had the revelation of it. Inspiration.
[2:12:22] He says the fortify by the is the word
[2:12:25] fortified by the inspiration by the
[2:12:28] revelation of the word. Still with me?
[2:12:31] He said then after he came around and he
[2:12:34] said the good he he he he was out there
[2:12:36] under that sycamore tree and he said he
[2:12:39] got up under the sycamore tree. And he
[2:12:41] said he was wondering about that
[2:12:43] scripture. I think it was Mark 11:23. Is
[2:12:46] it is what you say? He said whatever you
[2:12:49] say. He said always wondering about that
[2:12:51] scripture. Now he was talking about. Now
[2:12:54] you see why I pulled back Greg the other
[2:12:56] day Friday night when he pulled back
[2:12:59] over there brother Albert is because he
[2:13:01] was going this is what the Lord had
[2:13:02] showed me. And then brother Brandham had
[2:13:05] to realize that it was going to be a a
[2:13:08] change. Is that right? The change was
[2:13:10] coming because when he sat up under that
[2:13:13] sycamore tree, he did not recognize that
[2:13:16] voice.
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; Go back and look at it.
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; And after he get around there, they did
[2:13:24] not recognize it. Then after he came,
[2:13:26] why is because God was moving him into
[2:13:29] that scripture.
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; He never knew the revelation of that
[2:13:34] scripture. And now once he had God's
[2:13:37] servant had to move into that area first
[2:13:40] you got to move into your position
[2:13:42] justification sanctification baptism of
[2:13:45] the Holy Ghost and the adoption. The
[2:13:48] adoption places you now the Holy Ghost
[2:13:50] inside of you. God can move you in your
[2:13:52] position seasoning time and purpose. Is
[2:13:56] that right? He come back around in
[2:13:58] there. Now after he sat there up under
[2:14:01] that sycamore tree and that voice spoke
[2:14:04] to him and when that voice we about to
[2:14:05] close bear with me pray with me. He said
[2:14:08] he got around there in there was under
[2:14:10] that sycamore tree and he asked him
[2:14:12] again uh I'm telling you about moving
[2:14:14] into the spoken word now
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; the revelation came to him when he was
[2:14:24] in up under that sycamore tree. They was
[2:14:27] going hunting. And it was a voice he did
[2:14:30] not even recognize at that particular
[2:14:32] time.
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; And now he came because you know he had
[2:14:36] done talked to God numerous times before
[2:14:38] that. But this particular time here he
[2:14:42] was moving them into that scripture.
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; And he got over there. He was asking at
[2:14:49] that scripture
[2:14:51] the the that scripture the wrong way.
[2:14:57] He says in that scripture, he says,
[2:14:59] "What you say?"
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; He said, "Then you need some squirrels."
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; Now he needed some squirrels.
[2:15:10] Aren't you in a position out here that
[2:15:13] you need something?
[2:15:15] &gt;&gt; Don't you need something? See now when
[2:15:19] the inspiration come down he says you
[2:15:22] got to understand now when you need
[2:15:26] something
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; and the inspiration is there
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; don't miss it that's your opportunity
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; sir
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; I say now
[2:15:44] sometime he teach
[2:15:48] Then sometime he talk like a father
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; and then sometime he just start
[2:15:53] preaching like an evangelist.
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; The presence is there.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; You got to be come through the door.
[2:16:05] Don't come through the door talking.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:16:09] &gt;&gt; A nose bleed. Get out of here Satan.
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; Boo devil.
[2:16:15] Buddhist,
[2:16:18] [Applause]
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; you're the children of God.
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; You're the spoken word of God.
[2:16:31] &gt;&gt; God chose you for this time. You're
[2:16:33] overcomers.
[2:16:36] [Applause]
[2:16:39] spoken word,
[2:16:44] &gt;&gt; but he had to see it in the scriptures.
[2:16:47] God hid it from him until it was time.
[2:16:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:16:53] [Music]
[2:16:54] That's right.
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; We went in there.
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; That voice said again,
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; but you got to understand.
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:17:06] He said on the scripture then he started
[2:17:11] trying. He tried the spirit.
[2:17:14] Where you wanted that? I wanted to run
[2:17:17] down that hill.
[2:17:20] Here come the squirrel.
[2:17:24] I wanted on that limb of that tree or
[2:17:27] that oak tree. Here come the squirrel.
[2:17:31] Dispensation time was changing for
[2:17:33] brother Brandham.
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:17:35] Yes sir.
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; But he had to see it in the scriptures.
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; What you say if you if you say to this
[2:17:44] mountain and doubt not in your heart.
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; He said man. He said then the voice said
[2:17:52] again.
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; Didn't you say three?
[2:17:56] [Applause]
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; He was moving to something.
[2:18:04] It's got to be specific and you got to
[2:18:06] know. And remember after he got the
[2:18:08] three,
[2:18:11] the devil came and said, "There's many
[2:18:13] more squirrels out here. He never
[2:18:16] moved." See,
[2:18:20] see what we moving into. You're going to
[2:18:22] be tried and tested.
[2:18:24] You got to understand what's being
[2:18:26] preached.
[2:18:28] You got to realize it's time for us. I
[2:18:31] ain't even got over there into the
[2:18:32] Patma's vision and showed you we going
[2:18:34] to be held responsible.
[2:18:37] Simple things about just tear tear down,
[2:18:39] root up, build out. We got to bring the
[2:18:41] bring this gospel to those that's bound
[2:18:43] up in the system. Not the people.
[2:18:46] There's good people. This the system
[2:18:48] that's binding them.
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; There's people in there in in in these
[2:18:54] lives out there in these runchy lives
[2:18:57] out here. Then remember he went and now
[2:19:02] before he could go to Hattie Wright, he
[2:19:04] had to experience it himself.
[2:19:07] And then remember they went to Hadtie's
[2:19:09] Wright's house. And under the
[2:19:12] inspiration,
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; that's right, brother. He said, pastor,
[2:19:17] he said what? You said the right thing.
[2:19:19] I'm not going to the story. Y'all know
[2:19:21] the story for the sake of time.
[2:19:24] We're talking about this gospel. We're
[2:19:26] talking about tear down, build up, root
[2:19:28] up, root up, tear down, build down. You
[2:19:31] know, one of the toughest things, the
[2:19:33] the toughest things for me to deal with
[2:19:34] out there, father, son, holy ghost,
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; them titles.
[2:19:41] Well, you talk about people turn to
[2:19:42] stone face when you telling the man that
[2:19:44] got to be rebaptized.
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; If he don't catch it under inspiration,
[2:19:49] he gonna sit right there.
[2:19:52] He's not going to move
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; under his inspiration.
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; You got to realize
[2:20:00] what the Lord is doing. I'll stop.
[2:20:03] I'll stop because there's more
[2:20:05] testimonies. Let me say this here. So
[2:20:09] you I bring it up to what testifying
[2:20:12] under the ministry what I'm sitting
[2:20:15] under the souls God is bringing in.
[2:20:17] You'll see him come judgment one day.
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:21] cuz those souls that that we go through.
[2:20:24] But I got to go in there straight and
[2:20:25] hard against those religious demons.
[2:20:28] We just had about 12 of them in a
[2:20:30] meeting. I was in an institution pastor.
[2:20:33] Got there
[2:20:36] and we had everything blocked off. I
[2:20:38] didn't know I was going to be able to
[2:20:39] get in the classroom. But we got in.
[2:20:42] They was locked down. Everybody was
[2:20:45] locked down. Locked down.
[2:20:47] And when they were locked down in there,
[2:20:49] they said, "Uh," I said, "Well, Sarge,
[2:20:53] can they go to Bible study?" She said,
[2:20:56] "Yeah, okay." So, like the runner on
[2:21:00] there, he went and found out how many
[2:21:02] wanted to come. 12.
[2:21:05] We got over there at 12, you know, and
[2:21:07] she let him out mercifully.
[2:21:10] So, we was in the slider and you know
[2:21:12] their conversation, they be saying
[2:21:15] choice words. they get around in there.
[2:21:17] So I looked at him and I just stood
[2:21:19] there and this the sergeant. I said,
[2:21:22] "Man, they not even respecting
[2:21:23] authority."
[2:21:25] So we got over there, we stood in there,
[2:21:28] you got to walk down the hall, they
[2:21:30] talking, whatever, going down the hall,
[2:21:34] going down there, we go in the
[2:21:35] classroom.
[2:21:37] I said,
[2:21:40] "Come on in. Sign your name right here."
[2:21:45] I waited for the sergeant to go. I'm
[2:21:48] waiting for the sergeant to go. I said,
[2:21:51] "Let me tell you something.
[2:21:57] You conduct yourself like men.
[2:22:02] Your situation has nothing to do
[2:22:06] that condition. Your condition has
[2:22:08] nothing to do with the promise of God.
[2:22:11] &gt;&gt; I said, "You understand that?"
[2:22:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; Suppose that was your mother. Suppose
[2:22:17] that was your sister.
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; I said, "You know why she in there
[2:22:21] working?
[2:22:23] Because of your lazy men."
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; And they looked at me like, "Where'd he
[2:22:29] come from?
[2:22:34] That's exactly what it was.
[2:22:37] We got in there. We had our study. It
[2:22:40] was 12.
[2:22:43] Had a lesson
[2:22:45] always working with most of the time
[2:22:47] born again. Trying to get them born
[2:22:48] again.
[2:22:50] We had over there. I said, "How many
[2:22:53] heads bowed,
[2:22:56] eyes closed, how many want to turn their
[2:22:58] life over to the Lord?
[2:23:00] Five hands went up
[2:23:03] &gt;&gt; and the five went up went and turned
[2:23:05] their life over to the Lord. They got
[2:23:07] over there called a sergeant. It's time
[2:23:10] for them to come.
[2:23:12] Now remember, they were locked down.
[2:23:14] They wasn't supposed to come.
[2:23:17] When they went out in the hall, it was
[2:23:20] like this.
[2:23:23] Sage turned around.
[2:23:27] She said, 'What days you say you come
[2:23:28] here?'
[2:23:32] She said, 'I need to put them on
[2:23:33] lockdown every day you come
[2:23:37] because you should have seen them. They
[2:23:40] conducted theirelves like men.
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:44] &gt;&gt; When I start telling them pastor about a
[2:23:46] man courting
[2:23:50] and that was thus say the Lord you gave
[2:23:51] them young men about being a man.
[2:23:53] Brother Brandham said 90%
[2:23:56] of the men locked up as over or by a
[2:23:59] unsaved woman.
[2:24:02] &gt;&gt; He said n, this is 1957. He said 93%
[2:24:06] of the people in America don't go to
[2:24:08] church.
[2:24:12] You see how
[2:24:15] much opportunity we have?
[2:24:18] Every day I get up, Lord, send someone
[2:24:21] across my path. I could tell them about
[2:24:24] the goodness of the Lord.
[2:24:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:28] &gt;&gt; And there's testimonies. And that's what
[2:24:30] I'm And it's more and more. But for the
[2:24:32] sake of time, we won't wear you out. We
[2:24:35] didn't even get we didn't even touch tip
[2:24:36] of what I want you to see. But it's a
[2:24:39] lot what the Lord has showed the prophet
[2:24:43] of God about the inspiration.
[2:24:48] People missing the inspiration, missing
[2:24:49] their opportunity, missing their
[2:24:51] healing, missing their deliverance.
[2:24:54] He said, "What you say?"
[2:24:59] We need a 100,000.
[2:25:01] 100,000 is coming. Amen.
