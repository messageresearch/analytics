[55:04] player the piano player was the only one
[55:07] in the church so he played piano
[55:10] according to his own way the same

[55:25] came he asked for for uh uh what do you
[55:28] call it like uh special song and they
[55:32] put him on the piano he was still the
[55:34] same piano but when the brother touched
[55:37] the
[55:38] piano the whole church got a different
[55:41] sound like every day we never hear that
[55:44] piano play like that because somebody
[55:47] knew what they were
[55:49] doing you might have that instrument for
[55:51] a long time but you don't know what
[55:54] you're doing the day you will know what

[57:44] chapter
[57:47] 6 Oh Glory to God Amen
[57:57] you can read this message and it doesn't
[57:59] do anything to
[58:02] you and if somebody else come and read
[58:04] it for
[58:06] you you wonder is that the
[58:09] same is the same
[58:11] book because now you begin to know what
[58:14] is going on the very content of the
[58:17] message amen amen amen if not we get
[58:21] somewhere in despair that's right say
[58:24] this is what was marriage so why
[58:26] why are they
[58:28] [Music]
[58:30] shouting that's all that's all that's it
[58:33] no that's not all the Bible says who
[58:36] found a
[58:38] wife found what good thing so a wife is
[58:43] what a good
[58:46] thing so why is your wife not a good
[58:49] [Applause]
[58:53] thing can you say amen amen what is
[58:57] wrong did God
[59:02] lie we make God look like a liar but his
[59:06] word is always
[59:07] true where is that good
[59:15] wife you hear
[59:20] that Judges chapter
[59:22] 6 glory to God
[59:26] the Bible says in verse
[59:28] one you know the story very well and the
[59:32] children of Israel did
[59:35] evil in the sight of the Lord and the
[59:38] Lord delivered them into the hand of
[59:40] Midian how many years seven years you
[59:43] might be
[59:46] seated so do we expect the Deliverance
[59:49] in the first year no in the second year
[59:52] no in the third year no in the fourth no
[59:56] no in the fifth no in the sixth no in
[59:59] the seven
[1:00:01] yes Deliverance in the seven years
[1:00:05] praise God verse two and the Hand of
[1:00:11] Midian let's go back in verse one he
[1:00:14] says and the Lord delivered them into
[1:00:17] the hand of
[1:00:18] who
[1:00:24] median pray is
[1:00:26] God amen amen he says verse two and the
[1:00:31] Hand of Midian
[1:00:33] prevailed against
[1:00:35] Israel and because of the
[1:00:38] medanite the children of Israel made
[1:00:42] them the dens which are in the mountains
[1:00:46] and caves and what strongholds so this
[1:00:52] oppression develop a new lifestyle
[1:00:56] correct he was not there before they
[1:01:00] were not living in the
[1:01:02] caves or in the den or in the mountain
[1:01:05] but because of the oppression they
[1:01:07] develop a second
[1:01:11] lifestyle and that lifestyle became
[1:01:15] normal that's how we
[1:01:18] live when you work you go to the
[1:01:20] mountain and you hide stuff that's how
[1:01:24] we live and amen amen amen even if you
[1:01:29] forget somebody will remind you hey
[1:01:30] remember we need to go to the mountain
[1:01:32] and to the caves right remember
[1:01:36] amen and so it was when Israel had sown
[1:01:41] that the midianite came
[1:01:43] up and The Who Am malachit stop did God
[1:01:48] deliver Israel in the hand of the amalik
[1:01:52] sir he delivered them in the hand of
[1:01:54] what medanite but why is the amalik
[1:02:01] coming certain
[1:02:04] demon are not
[1:02:10] single they go in
[1:02:17] P you begin to play around with women
[1:02:20] poverty will hit you that's what the
[1:02:22] Bible
[1:02:24] say and then lying spirit will come
[1:02:28] because you got a lie to cover up what
[1:02:30] you're doing so it's not one demon it's
[1:02:32] one that started but he he goes in the
[1:02:40] combo are we together are we together
[1:02:43] the Bible say he was Midian but now it's
[1:02:46] no longer Midian Midian doesn't come
[1:02:48] along when he comes he bring am
[1:02:50] malachite come on Amen the Bible says
[1:02:54] and so it was when Israel head soon that
[1:02:57] the medanite came up and the what
[1:02:59] amalekites come and the what the
[1:03:01] children of the everybody's coming up
[1:03:03] amen even they came up against them and
[1:03:06] they encamp against them and did what
[1:03:09] destroyed the increase of the earth
[1:03:11] until you come to Gaza and left no no
[1:03:15] sust sustainance sustenance for Israel
[1:03:19] neither sheep nor a ox nor what they
[1:03:23] destroy everything
[1:03:26] they only come when the paycheck
[1:03:30] comes when there is no paycheck they
[1:03:33] out because dare you suffering when the
[1:03:37] direct deposit come when they come
[1:03:40] that's a better way to make you
[1:03:44] understand amen and they begin to take
[1:03:49] everything until you
[1:03:53] overdraft then they leave you
[1:03:56] then they're waiting for the next
[1:03:59] paycheck amen amen verse five for they
[1:04:03] came up with their cattle and their
[1:04:06] tents and they came as what grasshoppers
[1:04:10] for what multitude for both they and
[1:04:14] their camel were without
[1:04:19] number and they enter into the land to
[1:04:23] do what destroy it what a great
[1:04:26] Army if you start counting them they
[1:04:29] don't have a number correct you're going
[1:04:31] to run out of the number that's right
[1:04:34] coming against Israel how can we take
[1:04:37] care of this situation are we
[1:04:40] together verse 6 and Israel was
[1:04:46] greatly impoverished not just
[1:04:48] impoverished greatly in other words they
[1:04:51] really handle Israel greatly
[1:04:54] impoverished
[1:04:55] because of the
[1:04:58] medanite but they were not alone it was
[1:05:02] the amalik and the children of the East
[1:05:04] because of the median and the children
[1:05:07] of Israel cried to the Lord amen an
[1:05:11] enemy without number an enemy that have
[1:05:15] other enemy that are coming against you
[1:05:19] amen now job to verse
[1:05:22] 11 the Bible says and there came an
[1:05:26] angel of the Lord and sat under an oak
[1:05:31] which was in offra that pertained to
[1:05:34] joash the
[1:05:36] abizer and his son Gideon Tres weat by

[1:33:22] his own what brother Bram say his whole

[1:34:37] getting sick Adam could not fall and
[1:34:40] break his leg but when death was
[1:34:43] introduced now Adam may die and God said
[1:34:47] that remember you are God even though
[1:34:50] you die like men
[1:34:53] so it's a prophecy that came after the

[2:27:25] thinking you look at him like this it's
[2:27:28] a glory of
[2:27:31] God so when they say Glory you look in
[2:27:35] at but they say we beheld the glory of
[2:27:40] God can you see his
[2:27:45] glory look at me where I am now can't
[2:27:49] you see his
[2:27:51] glory what Glory are you looking at me
[2:27:56] shining hold on my friend he said we
[2:28:00] beheld his what Glory the glory as the
[2:28:04] only begotten of what the father full of
[2:28:10] grace and
[2:28:12] truth so when they say where is the
[2:28:15] glory of God they say he's right
[2:28:20] yes God this is the glory of God but he
[2:28:23] has a
[2:28:26] beer he he's
[2:28:28] human yeah that's the glory of God full
[2:28:31] of

[2:28:39] adultery you will see his
[2:28:45] grace all he does he step on and begin
[2:28:48] to write with his finger
[2:28:50] that's right that's
[2:28:53] right is this the gra yes that's the
[2:28:55] grace of God so God became
[2:29:00] human amen God was made flesh and that
[2:29:04] was the glory of God Amen so where is

[2:40:53] that's the reason being a man you make
[2:40:57] yourself God now watch watch what the
[2:41:03] principle is what God in the people how
