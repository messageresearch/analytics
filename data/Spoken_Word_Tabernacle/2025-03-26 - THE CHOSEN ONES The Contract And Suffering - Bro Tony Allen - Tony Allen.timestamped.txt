[33:58] beating that fast they won't let you go

[34:13] there we started praying and we got
[34:15] there and we started praying still
[34:17] wouldn't go down and the doctor said but
[34:20] we know that God hear our prayers right
[34:23] so we weren looking at those numbers we

[1:24:27] how to go up amen cuz there's Rapture
[1:24:30] and Faith inside this
[1:24:34] building if you don't mind turn to the
[1:24:37] Book of Matthew and and I felt led to go
[1:24:41] back in this subject and yes sir may the
[1:24:44] Lord help me with this and Hallelujah
[1:24:47] think we touched a little bit B of it on
[1:24:49] New Year's night and and um God has laid
[1:24:53] it on my heart to deal with it yes sir
[1:24:56] you know we we'll see where he goes am
[1:24:59] you got your Bibles turned to the Book
[1:25:01] of
[1:25:02] Matthew um chapter 22
[1:25:10] verse4 if you got it say
[1:25:14] Amen am the scripture reads it says for
[1:25:19] many are called but few are chosen and
[1:25:23] you may be seated amen we're going to
[1:25:26] deal with
[1:25:30] this so my my my subject tonight will be
[1:25:33] the chosen ones
[1:25:36] in the contract and
[1:25:40] sufferings and um we'll see how far we
[1:25:43] can get with it yes sir um and brother
[1:25:45] Brenham constantly talk about the chosen
[1:25:47] ones and and and and he said those those
[1:25:49] ones though it was the church it made up
[1:25:52] the church and you know that those was
[1:25:54] the Believers those that God has chosen
[1:25:56] those has received that gift of the Holy
[1:25:59] Ghost and and they have the token yes
[1:26:01] sir what they need to to produce Rapture
[1:26:04] in
[1:26:05] faith so I'm going to start out with
[1:26:08] this uh this quote question and answer
[1:26:12] yes sir from
[1:26:13] 1959 paragraph 122 glory to God he said
[1:26:18] now you that's been called like that see
[1:26:23] I want to speak to you you the chosen
[1:26:27] ones that God chose us in him before the
[1:26:31] foundation of the world that's right
[1:26:34] think of that God chose us in him yes
[1:26:38] sir before the foundation of the world
[1:26:40] am God knew before the foundation of the
[1:26:44] world that I speak this same subject
[1:26:46] tonight amen he's infinite that's right
[1:26:49] and before there was a world uhhuh oh
[1:26:52] Sho here get get the Holy Ghost
[1:26:55] now the word will bring it see that's
[1:26:59] how it come that's right while Peter
[1:27:02] spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on
[1:27:04] them
[1:27:06] see then paragraph 123 goes on and says
[1:27:09] before there was a world you were in
[1:27:11] God's
[1:27:12] thoughts to give you the Holy
[1:27:16] Ghost because he knew am that you that
[1:27:20] you will be wanting
[1:27:22] it amen
[1:27:25] [Applause]
[1:27:27] so so so this so This
[1:27:29] choosing comes with a
[1:27:32] desire it comes with an
[1:27:35] expectation and and and you will begin
[1:27:37] to pull for things that belongs to
[1:27:39] you before you even receive
[1:27:43] it and God said he already knew before
[1:27:46] you got here that you was going to want
[1:27:49] the Holy Ghost so he already prepared a
[1:27:52] way for you to receive it
[1:27:55] [Music]
[1:28:00] he said because he knew that You' be
[1:28:01] want it and he chose you himself because
[1:28:05] you desired it he chose you in Christ
[1:28:09] before you or Jesus any of you was on
[1:28:12] the earth and He sent Jesus to die to
[1:28:16] prepare the way to send the Holy Ghost
[1:28:20] to bring you to himself that's right and
[1:28:23] he said hm hm oh that just I know I made
[1:28:27] this is the church so I'm at home now
[1:28:30] you see oh that is so rich to me to
[1:28:33] think it's not not one thing that you
[1:28:36] have not one thing to do with it but
[1:28:39] before the world ever started God sought
[1:28:42] us and put our name on the Lamb's Book
[1:28:44] of Life before there even was a world
[1:28:47] talk about
[1:28:49] God hallelujah now in the message to
[1:28:52] whom is the arm of the Lord reveal
[1:28:54] in
[1:28:55] 1950 paragraph 31 he says he says the
[1:28:59] brass serpent couldn't pray for no one
[1:29:02] could it then he says the pool of
[1:29:04] Bethesda the Angels didn't pray for no
[1:29:07] one it was a troubled water is that
[1:29:10] right they just looked and lived with
[1:29:14] the brass serent and in the days of the
[1:29:17] Apostles they laid in the shadow of
[1:29:19] Peter and was healed that's right and he
[1:29:21] says now if you don't believe that this
[1:29:23] is Bible times again just a
[1:29:27] repeat in this last days God's calling
[1:29:30] out a people of the Gentiles he's
[1:29:33] calling on the Jews and a gentile Church
[1:29:35] the same thing a
[1:29:38] contract so so this is what I want to
[1:29:40] deal with right now the contract
[1:29:43] yes in the message Jehovah Gyra yes sir
[1:29:48] 1957 paragraph 34 brother BR says now
[1:29:53] like in in America uhuh if I say say
[1:29:56] we'll make a covenant uhhuh or promise
[1:29:59] one another we'll go over and have us a
[1:30:02] little sandwich and made some kind of a
[1:30:04] deal he said I take hold of a man's hand

[1:30:50] he said they wrote on a piece of paper
[1:30:52] y'all bear with me we going somewhere
[1:30:55] he said I agreed to do this in such and
[1:30:57] such a thing he said then they tore the

[1:31:19] dovetail perfectly with the other piece
[1:31:22] of paper right
[1:31:24] yes my brother Hallelujah then he says
[1:31:27] now how God was showing Abraham he said
[1:31:31] if we had time to go into it he said but
[1:31:33] here's what it was listen he said God
[1:31:36] was showing that through the Seed of
[1:31:38] Abraham yes sir would bring Christ his
[1:31:41] own son through Isaac to Christ and that
[1:31:44] on Calvary God took his own son yes sir
[1:31:48] and tore him apart that's right so he
[1:31:50] lifted up the body and set it on his
[1:31:53] right hand
[1:31:54] and sent the other part the Holy Spirit
[1:31:57] down on the church he saying when the
[1:31:59] Rapture comes it have to be that same
[1:32:01] spirit that was on Christ will have to

[1:34:36] cannot be made perfect that's right so
[1:34:38] they're waiting on us to reach
[1:34:40] profession it's going to take that
[1:34:42] spirit and I and I want you to remember
[1:34:44] that that spirit that you possess

[1:34:55] it's going to deliver
[1:34:57] [Applause]
[1:35:00] [Music]
[1:35:07] you he says now how God was SE
[1:35:12] Abraham paragraph 35 in Jehovah
[1:35:15] JY Jehovah JY 1957 paragraph 35 he said
[1:35:19] now God was showing Abraham if we had
[1:35:22] time to go into it but here what it was
[1:35:25] God was showing that through the Seed of
[1:35:26] Abraham would bring Christ his own son
[1:35:29] through Isaac to Christ and that on
[1:35:31] Calvary God took his own son tore him
[1:35:34] apart he lifted up that body and set it
[1:35:36] on his right hand and sent the other
[1:35:38] part the Holy Spirit down to the church
[1:35:41] and when the Rapture comes it has to be
[1:35:43] that same spirit that was on Christ we
[1:35:45] have to doveet tail with that promise or
[1:35:47] it will be rejected no wonder he said
[1:35:51] except the man be born again he will no
[1:35:53] wise enter into the kingdom that's right
[1:35:54] it has to be that same holy ghost that
[1:35:57] fell on the day of Pentecost has to
[1:35:59] baptize every believer or it won't be
[1:36:02] the same Spirit that's right and
[1:36:03] contract that was tore at Calvary that's
[1:36:06] right think of that oh that ought to
[1:36:07] make the Pentecost shout anyhow said
[1:36:10] think of it the unconditional Covenant
[1:36:13] God said it has to be and he tore it
[1:36:15] apart soul and body of his own son he
[1:36:19] took the body and sent the spirit to the
[1:36:20] church and that Spirit can come in the
[1:36:22] church today and perform the same
[1:36:24] Miracles showing and people will laugh
[1:36:27] at it and walk away from it he said how
[1:36:29] do you ever expect to make the Rapture
[1:36:31] or go in to see God he said there we are
[1:36:34] maybe you never seen that before like
[1:36:36] that and he goes on and say now you see
[1:36:39] why it's necessary you got to be born of
[1:36:41] the
[1:36:43] spirit the spirit of Christ has to be in
[1:36:46] you cuz it has to be that same Spirit
[1:36:49] take your body to be joined with that
[1:36:52] body the The Same Spirit that was tore
[1:36:55] off of Christ tore out of Christ or
[1:36:57] Jesus and if that spirit is in you it'll
[1:37:00] make you do the things that Christ
[1:37:02] did so if you possess that Spirit you
[1:37:05] ought to be walking like Christ you
[1:37:07] ought to be talking like Christ
[1:37:09] everything you should do should be
[1:37:10] lining up like
[1:37:12] Christ it'll make you live like the life
[1:37:15] that Christ Liv and Christ was about the
[1:37:17] father's business all times no Gathering
[1:37:20] about at shows and entertainment was
[1:37:22] about the father's business now you see
[1:37:25] why it was hard to have a healing
[1:37:26] service brother Bon said you got to get
[1:37:28] a foundation first you got to get the
[1:37:31] People based on thust say the Lord and

[1:38:43] example when he went to
[1:38:45] Gethsemane he prayed three
[1:38:47] times sir he TR he tried to pass that
[1:38:51] cup he tried to pass that coup of
[1:38:54] suffering the flesh didn't want to go

[1:40:11] Paul was Paul was convinced there was
[1:40:13] nothing that could separate him for the
[1:40:14] love of
[1:40:15] Christ cuz he recognized his position he
[1:40:19] he he knew his position he knew he
[1:40:21] possessed that spirit so he he knew
[1:40:24] there was nothing that could separate
[1:40:25] him from God because he was tied to

[1:44:10] led him by the hand and brought him to
[1:44:11] Damascus yes sir and he was there three
[1:44:14] days without sight and neither did he
[1:44:16] eat nor drink now now now we know this
[1:44:19] story now he he's automatically fasting
[1:44:21] autom automatically
[1:44:24] fasting now now he went for being a A
[1:44:27] persecuted and a murderer now he already
[1:44:29] showing signs of a
[1:44:32] Believer already showing signs of a
[1:44:35] Believer and we we we know this story
[1:44:37] and he automatic begin to fast that's
[1:44:40] right verse 10 is say there was a
[1:44:42] certain disciple of Damascus name ananas
[1:44:45] and to him said the Lord in the vision
[1:44:47] Vision ananas and he said behold I am he
[1:44:50] Lord and the Lord said unto him arise
[1:44:53] and go into the street which is called
[1:44:54] straight and inquire in the house of

[1:45:05] life automatically I want you I want to
[1:45:08] you keep that automatically in your mind
[1:45:10] he automatically gains a prayer life and
[1:45:13] have seen in a vision a man named ananas
[1:45:17] coming in yes sir and putting his hand

[1:45:25] by many of this man how much evil he
[1:45:28] have done to thy Saints at
[1:45:32] Jerusalem so so what ananas is saying
[1:45:35] Lord if it was me I I wouldn't choose
[1:45:38] this
[1:45:41] man that's what that's what he's saying
[1:45:44] Lord Lord you sure you want this one I
[1:45:47] would I wouldn't choose this
[1:45:49] man but but remember what I said God
[1:45:51] does the choosing
[1:45:53] [Applause]
[1:45:55] it's God that does the choosing cuz we
[1:45:58] would have been cast out a long time ago
[1:46:00] if it were based off our works but I'm
[1:46:03] so glad that God does the
[1:46:05] [Applause]
[1:46:05] [Music]
[1:46:08] choosing in verse 14 he says and here he
[1:46:12] have authority from the chief priest to
[1:46:14] bind all that call on thy
[1:46:16] name but the Lord said unto him go thy
[1:46:19] way for he is a chos in vessel unto me
[1:46:25] to Bear my name before the Gentiles and
[1:46:28] Kings and the children of Israel for I
[1:46:32] will show this the verse I want you to
[1:46:34] get for I will show him how great things
[1:46:39] he must suffer for my name's
[1:46:42] sake so Saul
[1:46:46] conversion
[1:46:48] automatically came with a suffering
[1:46:53] his conversion automatically came with a
[1:46:56] suffering and this suffering he didn't
[1:46:58] ask for he didn't put a petition in for
[1:47:02] it but it was automatically given to him
[1:47:06] just for being
[1:47:08] [Applause]
[1:47:13] converted for he say I will show him how
[1:47:16] great things he must suffer for my
[1:47:18] name's sake that's right in the book of
[1:47:21] Philippians chapter U verse chapter 1
[1:47:24] verse 29
[1:47:27] Hallelujah Philippians chapter 1 verse
[1:47:30] 29 you got it say
[1:47:33] amen for it
[1:47:36] reads for unto you it is given in the
[1:47:40] behalf of Christ yes sir not only to
[1:47:43] believe on him but also to suffer for
[1:47:46] his sake having the same conflict which
[1:47:49] you saw in me and now bear and now here
[1:47:52] to be in me
[1:47:53] yes so there's two there's two different
[1:47:55] ways you can suffer that's
[1:47:58] it you you you can you can do something
[1:48:02] wrong and and reap the percussions of it
[1:48:05] and you can suffer for that but there
[1:48:08] also is another suffering that Christ is
[1:48:10] speaking about and you don't have to do
[1:48:12] anything to receive this
[1:48:14] one you you don't have to do nothing
[1:48:16] wrong it's automatically given to
[1:48:20] you Hallelujah amen and and this this is
[1:48:24] the one that Christians struggle with
[1:48:26] because we we we walk a good walk and
[1:48:29] and and and we do everything that we can
[1:48:31] do but then we found out we always find
[1:48:33] our back up against the
[1:48:35] wall we didn't do anything but God said
[1:48:38] you going to receive a
[1:48:42] [Applause]
[1:48:46] suffering thank you but first Peter the
[1:48:49] book of Peter 1 Peter chapter 2 verse 19
[1:48:54] you see what God think about this
[1:48:57] suffer we're going to look at it in a
[1:48:59] whole new light after tonight hallelujah
[1:49:03] hallelujah 1 Peter chap 2 verse
[1:49:09] 19 and he says yes sir for this is
[1:49:12] thankworthy
[1:49:14] if a man for conscience toward God
[1:49:17] endure grief suffering wrongfully
[1:49:23] Lord verse 20 say for what glory is it
[1:49:28] if when you be buffered for your faults
[1:49:30] you shall take it patiently but if when
[1:49:33] you do well and suffer for it you take
[1:49:36] it patiently this is a self with
[1:49:41] God we going to pause right
[1:49:47] there so God God is weing the two the
[1:49:50] two different
[1:49:52] the two different
[1:49:54] sufferings he God is saying that if if
[1:49:57] if you as a Christian go do something
[1:49:59] wrong and you and you have you have
[1:50:01] become one within yourself that you know
[1:50:03] you doing wrong and and you receive a
[1:50:06] suffering for it and you you take it
[1:50:09] well because you you say well Lord I
[1:50:12] deserve this I've done this and I
[1:50:15] deserve this but God say it's more

[1:58:28] God it's the will of
[1:58:30] God it's the will of
[1:58:36] God
[1:58:43] God turn to Malachi chapter 3 yes sir
[1:58:47] and and and this is a familiar story and
[1:58:48] we we we know
[1:58:50] this Mal
[1:58:52] 3:
[1:58:58] 13 and this and this is the conversation
[1:59:01] with the Believers you know when they
[1:59:03] went to
[1:59:04] complaining and and God had a problem
[1:59:06] with that yes sir he said your words
[1:59:08] have been Stout against me say the Lord
[1:59:12] yet you say what have we spoken so much
[1:59:14] against thee uhhuh he said you have said
[1:59:16] it is in vain to serve God and what
[1:59:19] prophet is it that we have kept his
[1:59:21] ordinance and that we have walked
[1:59:23] mournfully before the Lord of hosts and
[1:59:25] now we call the proud happy y they that
[1:59:28] work wickedness are set up yay they that
[1:59:32] temp God or even delivered and and and
[1:59:35] and they was complaining they bought the
[1:59:36] petition they was they was saying that
[1:59:38] the wicked do wicked and and they and
[1:59:40] they don't get this
[1:59:42] suffering right they get by and and and
[1:59:46] and but God had a problem with that
[1:59:48] because they didn't catch the Revelation
[1:59:50] that this suffering was was given to
[1:59:53] them they they didn't know why they was
[1:59:55] going through that right and and God God
[1:59:57] talking to them like you're talking like
[1:59:58] you don't understand why you getting
[2:00:00] what you get you act like you don't know
[2:00:03] so that that's exactly what he's
[2:00:05] saying why you complaining about
[2:00:08] something that supposed to be for you
[2:00:10] uhh in the message perfect Faith yes sir
[2:00:13] 1963 yes sir paragraph
[2:00:16] 94 but Bown say now watch and he said to
[2:00:20] us if you abide in me
[2:00:22] and my word and you St John here you can
[2:00:25] ask what you will it'll be done he said
[2:00:28] then recognize your position in the
[2:00:29] scripture as a Believer he see he say
[2:00:33] see you got to recognize your position
[2:00:35] as he recognized his position that's
[2:00:37] right it's not as written that Christ
[2:00:39] shall come and what all Christ would do
[2:00:42] he said that Copus and them that morning
[2:00:44] isn't it written in the scriptures that
[2:00:46] they'll have to that he must suffer and
[2:00:48] then been killed and then be killed and
[2:00:50] raised the third day right said why are
[2:00:52] you so slow of understanding that's
[2:00:55] right and and that's what Jesus as he
[2:00:56] say it's written in the scriptures that
[2:00:58] that that I must suffer he say and you
[2:01:01] and you acting like you're not getting
[2:01:04] it so so so God and that's what God was
[2:01:07] saying in Malachi why are you
[2:01:08] complaining about this suffering that
[2:01:10] made it to you if you look in the
[2:01:12] scripture you will see that you entitled
[2:01:15] you entitled to a certain type of
[2:01:16] suffering just for being converted just
[2:01:18] for following me you entitled to a
[2:01:20] certain suffering
[2:01:25] [Music]
[2:01:33] hallu in second Corinthians chapter
[2:01:37] 4:17 the Bible even said for I light
[2:01:42] afflictions which is but for a
[2:01:45] moment working for us a far more
[2:01:47] exceeding and eternal weight of Glory am
[2:01:52] praise God
[2:01:53] Amen so let go to the Book of Mark and
[2:01:56] I'm trying to time you go to the Book of
[2:02:00] Mark chapter 10 verse
[2:02:04] 35 me show you that a Believer a
[2:02:07] Believer will pull for things Hall they
[2:02:11] they they will pull for things before
[2:02:13] even time for them to get
[2:02:16] it they'll pull for days and and and and
[2:02:21] I and it it's good when you pull for
[2:02:23] good things and promises but let's see
[2:02:26] let's see what he was asking for that's
[2:02:28] exactly right and and in the book of
[2:02:31] Isaiah 53 you know 7 he say he was
[2:02:35] oppressed and was afflicted yet he open
[2:02:38] not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to
[2:02:40] the slaughter and as a sheep before his
[2:02:42] sheers is D so he open not his mouth
[2:02:44] right now we on the Book of Mark yes sir
[2:02:48] chap 10:35 it says and James and John
[2:02:51] the sons of
[2:02:52] zebede come into come into him saying
[2:02:56] Master we would that thou should have do
[2:02:58] for us whatsoever we shall
[2:03:00] desire and he said to them what were you
[2:03:04] that I should do for you and they said
[2:03:06] unto him Grant unto us that we may sit
[2:03:10] one on thy right hand and the other on
[2:03:12] the left hand in thy Glory but Jesus
[2:03:16] said unto them you know not what you ask
[2:03:19] for
[2:03:22] he said you know not what you ask
[2:03:24] for he said can you
[2:03:27] drink of the cup that I drink
[2:03:30] of so he basically asking can can can
[2:03:33] you take this type of suffering that I'm
[2:03:35] going through do you know what you
[2:03:37] asking for and and they were perfect
[2:03:39] examples of sheep led to the slaughter
[2:03:41] cuz when you leave a sheep to the
[2:03:42] slaughter he's totally D to what getting
[2:03:45] ready to go happen he go through the
[2:03:47] slaughter instantly and these brothers
[2:03:49] were asking for suffering and didn't
[2:03:52] even know they was asking
[2:03:56] for but but but NE but nethertheless the
[2:03:59] suffing was for them but they didn't
[2:04:01] know it but they was asking for it ahead
[2:04:04] of
[2:04:05] [Music]
[2:04:08] time Jesus say Jesus said can you drink
[2:04:12] of the cup that I drink and be baptized
[2:04:14] with the baptism that I am baptized with
[2:04:17] and they said to him we can and Jesus
[2:04:21] said to to them you shall indeed drink
[2:04:24] of the cup that I drink of and with the
[2:04:28] baptism that I am baptized with shall
[2:04:31] you be baptized so Jesus went out and
[2:04:33] prophesy
[2:04:35] for that what you think you want you
[2:04:38] going to get
[2:04:40] it and and and that that's the pull of a
[2:04:42] Believer they were pulling for something
[2:04:45] and and they didn't even have it wasn't
[2:04:46] even time for them to suffer
[2:04:48] [Music]
[2:04:50] yet why
[2:04:52] because they didn't have the Holy Spirit
[2:04:54] on the inside yet it it wasn't time for
[2:04:57] them to suffer and and the same thing
[2:04:59] happened with Peter Peter God Christ
[2:05:02] told him to say Peter before the C cow
[2:05:05] through twice Thrice you going to deny
[2:05:07] me three times and and and God knew
[2:05:10] Peter was asking for a suffering that he
[2:05:14] wasn't ready to to to go
[2:05:16] through Jesus said
[2:05:18] Peter I hear you but but when this
[2:05:22] suffering come you going to deny me
[2:05:24] three times you going to deny me three
[2:05:26] times but he was a Believer and he was
[2:05:29] asking for it was a pull on the inside
[2:05:32] we always pull for things that belong to
[2:05:36] us but but look in the scriptures you
[2:05:39] don't see nowhere what Peter deny Crist
[2:05:41] after
[2:05:43] Pentecost once he got that that Spirit
[2:05:45] on the inside you don't see nowhere
[2:05:47] where he Deni Christ now he's ready for
[2:05:50] that suffering yes that's why Jesus told
[2:05:52] him you going to deny me three times
[2:05:54] because you don't have that Spirit
[2:05:56] you're not equipped to deal with this
[2:05:58] yet you only making it because I'm here
[2:06:02] he said the devil desire to sniff you as
[2:06:04] weak but I pray for
[2:06:05] you so just for Peter having that desire
[2:06:09] the devil desired the sniff him as we
[2:06:12] that desire got the devil
[2:06:15] [Music]
[2:06:17] [Applause]
[2:06:19] attention hallu
[2:06:25] J oh
[2:06:31] [Music]
[2:06:33] Jesus you and like I said when God God
[2:06:38] choses his vessels and and he he chose
[2:06:42] he chose Believers right he sent he sent
[2:06:45] so much suffering to his
[2:06:47] Believers and and Jo Jo was a good
[2:06:50] example he was a perfect man
[2:06:52] God say he was perfect but he was also
[2:06:55] the perfect candidate for God he was the
[2:06:59] perfect candidate for God to describ
[2:07:02] sufferings to show the devil knowing
[2:07:04] that through these sufferings he won't
[2:07:07] deny me you won't separate him from me
[2:07:11] cuz if you think about it when the sons
[2:07:13] of God went in the presence of God Satan
[2:07:15] was there too every time the sons of God
[2:07:18] went Satan went and he asked Satan he
[2:07:20] said he said why Why th here he said I'm
[2:07:23] coming to and fro looking for someone I
[2:07:25] can devour so so when he when he say
[2:07:29] have you considered my servant Joel and
[2:07:31] and he said I will but you got a hedge
[2:07:33] around it so it's God the one that puts
[2:07:37] the Hedge
[2:07:41] up and is God is the one that drops the
[2:07:44] [Music]
[2:07:45] [Applause]
[2:07:46] Hedge and and that's what that's what I
[2:07:48] mean you need to know where it comes
[2:07:50] from cuz God is contr roll in the Hedge
[2:07:53] and and and Satan made it clear while
[2:07:55] the Hedge was up he could not get the
[2:07:57] Joel he could not touch him and God
[2:08:01] intentionally dropped the head he
[2:08:03] intentionally dropped the head and he
[2:08:05] sent him to him but the good part about
[2:08:07] it he s a governor he told him how far
[2:08:09] to go that's it he told him what he
[2:08:11] could do and he told him what he
[2:08:12] couldn't
[2:08:13] [Applause]
[2:08:16] do you know he went to Joel
[2:08:19] twice even the first time when he
[2:08:21] reached his limit he went back and he
[2:08:23] came back again and God asked him have
[2:08:25] you considered him again God sent him
[2:08:27] back to Joel he dropped the Hedge again
[2:08:31] so I'm thinking like when the devil goes
[2:08:35] into the presence of God I'm I'm trying
[2:08:37] to get his thinking so when God drops
[2:08:40] the
[2:08:41] Hedge in the devil's
[2:08:44] Mind through sufferings and persecutions
[2:08:48] trials and testing the devil
[2:08:52] thinking I can use this to separate them
[2:08:56] from God that that's his
[2:08:58] thinking but God on the other hand say
[2:09:01] look I'm going to allow you to do this
[2:09:03] but I'm going to tell you how far to go
[2:09:05] but through this
[2:09:07] suffering through this
[2:09:10] suffering see God God is getting
[2:09:12] something totally different out of it he
[2:09:14] get something totally through this
[2:09:16] suffering they going to be
[2:09:19] strengthen they going to come to perfect
[2:09:21] [Applause]
[2:09:22] [Music]
[2:09:24] so if the de if the devil really knew
[2:09:25] what his suffering was going to bring he
[2:09:28] probably would have walked
[2:09:29] away if he if he knew why putting Christ
[2:09:32] on the cross was going to do he probably
[2:09:34] would have left him
[2:09:36] alone so this this is what I want you to
[2:09:38] see in suffering I want you to look at
[2:09:40] it in a whole different
[2:09:42] way don't worry about it when it make it
[2:09:45] to
[2:09:46] you just worry about what you possess
[2:09:49] [Music]
[2:09:50] [Applause]
[2:09:51] n number one we already know who s it
[2:09:55] and we already know why he s it so while
[2:09:57] it's there you rejoice you be happy you
[2:10:01] be glad because you a candidate use the
[2:10:04] perfect example that you suffering with
[2:10:06] Christ and Paul say you ought to be
[2:10:07] happy for those things because God chose
[2:10:09] you he chose you from the foundation of
[2:10:12] the world he put in your contract for
[2:10:14] you to for you to do this certain role
[2:10:17] it's for you so you need to know what
[2:10:19] position that you got to play and on
[2:10:21] once you know your position you begin to
[2:10:22] look at things in a different
[2:10:26] [Music]
[2:10:27] Manner and like I said nobody wants to
[2:10:29] suffer nobody wants to suffer but Christ
[2:10:33] say is it's good for his sake it's good
[2:10:36] for his sake so so change that
[2:10:39] mentality and know that you possess the
[2:10:42] other part of the
[2:10:43] contract you got the other part of the
[2:10:46] contract and and and what you got is the
[2:10:48] only thing that can fit with the part he
[2:10:51] sent the
[2:10:53] glory so that mean nobody can't take
[2:10:55] your
[2:10:57] place nobody can't take your
[2:11:00] [Applause]
[2:11:03] place and I say L I said Lord why do you
[2:11:06] want me to deal with
[2:11:08] sufferings so so when I thought about it
[2:11:11] I said well well that is a problem you
[2:11:13] know cuz sometimes we don't know why and
[2:11:16] and God is saying that through your
[2:11:19] conversion yes sir you are
[2:11:22] automatically entitled sir to a certain
[2:11:26] type of
[2:11:27] suffering and and and you don't have to
[2:11:29] ask for it you don't have to sign no
[2:11:32] paper for it it's automatically given to
[2:11:34] you he he said but no when it make it to
[2:11:38] you yes sir know who you are know who
[2:11:41] you are and and the reason that it came
[2:11:44] and that and and that when you can find
[2:11:47] joy peace and happiness and you can find
[2:11:51] that cuz you got to get to a point where
[2:11:53] you can see
[2:11:55] God you got to see
[2:11:58] God there was a man that spit in David
[2:12:00] David said leave him alone God had it
[2:12:02] done you got to see God in the midst of
[2:12:05] it and God and God is love God is Joy
[2:12:09] God is peace God is happiness and if you
[2:12:11] can ever find God in the midst then you
[2:12:13] can develop those you can Dev those
[2:12:16] offsprings you can come on musicians
[2:12:20] [Music]
[2:12:21] than so what are we looking for we
[2:12:23] looking for God in the midst of the
[2:12:25] storm if you can if you can ever see God
[2:12:29] in the midst then you you will forget
[2:12:31] about the
[2:12:34] surrounders and and before you know it
